      <field name="fulltext">THE ACCUSER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE The author of these books of drama is dead. He had been slowly dying for some years: then, of a sudden, he started on a journey of desire to Rome, that he might reach it before he died. Soon after his arrival death came; and he is buried in an uninscribed grave under Roman cypresses. He had always said he should go to Rome to die; and he carried out his dream with his will. Before starting he had revised and printed most of the work he felt he had but short time to care for. It is probable he intended to issue the two volumes at different times: the weight of circumstance has compelled the friend, who is now acting for him, to publish at once all the work that lay in sheets or was still in the Press. Among the papers left at home a sketch was found of a play entitled The Temple, designed to complete the Herodian series, that began with Mariamne, published in 1908, and was continued in The Accuser, among the plays now published. The unfinished play dealt with the effort of Herod Agrippa to preserve the Jewish Temple from the pollution of a statue of Caligula, set up to be worshipped as divine. It promised a vivid presentation of the mad Emperor. The sketch found was incomplete, but it is believed that a complete, but unrevised, copy is in existence. The author was so secret in all his ways, almost stealthy, that hidden manuscripts may be found, like a squirrel's hoard; they may even be lying forgotten in some publisher's drawer. The subject of Tristan always had for the author of Borgia a haunting incitement. He felt he could treat the story from many points of view. Two essays of varied interpretation are to be found in these volumes, and were set in separate volumes by the dramatist himself. So intense was his desire to be nameless that those to whom his memory is a force on their love cannot bring themselves to divulge a personality so guarded from discovery. The friend who writes this note is as unskilled in words as Horatio; but, unlike Horatio, has had no charge to tell the story of Hamlet, no injunction to speak out anything of truth before that breadth of finality: âThe rest is silence.â</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene Jerusalem: a room in the King's house, giving on a marble terrace, which is seen through columns of marble. Pomegranate-trees, in blood-red flower, stand formal along the terrace; scarlet curtains are looped back with purple cords against each column. Herod leans over the terrace eagerly, paces it several times, and then looks out still more eagerly. After a while, he turns from the parapet and faces the room, his hands wrapped in his purple robe. Herod. Accusedâ How freshly in my heart, as spring accuses Some winter morn with all her windy light! Acussed . . . that I have left My first-born son behind me with my youth, Antipater, my Arab! Almost Roman My sons by Mariamne, and they mock me A little for the wildness in my heart, This wildness growing wilder now in age, When all the deserts spread their boundaries. My Arab sonâ And reared as I was reared, and of my race, And shy . . . oh, that will be a bond . . . my Arab! [Perceiving his sister, who enters and prostrates herself before him. Salome! Salome. Herod, and a suppliant too, And of the moment's opportunity, And pleading by the pressure of the moment. Are you not watching for your Arab son, Antipater, and, wistful as a lover, Roving from column on to column? Give me My Arab lover, Herod, though he may not Become a Jew, lest he be stoned to death By his own people . . . Say that I am old And in the shadowâbut he seeks my shade, As it were comfort from the noontide sun! Give him to me, and for my sole delight, As his delight is in me. Herod. No, Salome. Two generations of our father's blood Part us alone from Arab heathendom: We must be Jewish in our nuptials, and Our offspring Roman in the breath they draw. Salome (from the ground). For whom, my brother, For whom are your eyes listening, as the lights In a roused lion's face?âAntipater, The child of Doris, the Arabian Doris, Daughter of Esau with red-threaded hair, Doris, whom you abandoned. . . . Herod. Ay, abandoned . . . And drew a roseleaf of God's rose, as amber Draws such a roseleaf, to my heartâas amber, Drew the red roseleaf Mariamne, Peace! [Alexander and Aristobulus enter along the terrace. Her children! Ah, their names, the royal names, Aristobulus, Alexander. . . . [Salome rises sullenly. Herod involuntarily makes a movement toward the young men. Salome draws back to the parapet of the terrace, where Herod had before been keeping watch. Alexander (advancing). Father, You called us? Herod. No. Alexander. Our namesâI heard our names! Herod. I did not call. Alexander. And yet I heard my name, I heard my brother's, I heard . . . Herod. Eavesdropping! Alexander. No!âNot that . . . her name. You spoke it, father, as you loved its measure. [There is silence. Aristobulus. And you did call us, father. Herod. Noâ Come here, you have not kissed me. [He takes Aristobulus' face in his hands. Like your uncle, The priest, your uncle . . . [He stops speaking and dreams. Kiss me, Alexander; But kiss me. . . . And you heard your mother's name? Fie, you were listening! Go! [The young men pass down the terrace between the pomegranate-flowers and the red curtains. . . . Her obstinate, still deathâshut in her doom, As water locked up in chalcedony! [Turning toward Salome. Is he not like his mother? Ha, these pictures Of the dead that loved us so, these living things That do not love us! And the beauty cold And stubborn on their faces. Mariamne! âThat was the name I called. Salome (advancing quickly and again kneeling). Your watcher, Herod! Antipater is here! Now my reward! Oh, joy! This is a portent and precursiveâ Behind, at your recall, there is my lover. . . . Herod. I will not see that laughter in your eyes, That rich cajoling for another. Wistful Be you to please me! Greet Antipater! . . . Tell me a little; you have seen him. Speak! Is his hair silvered? A Eunuch enters Eunuch. Sire, The young prince from the East world come to you. Herod. Bring the young prince. [Exit Eunuch. [Herod watches the door. As the curtain opens, Salome, after making in vain a gesture of suppliant appeal, moves away from Herod. She meets Antipater, who bows low, but she turns from him, sweeping her cloak away from him, and goes out. Antipater stands in the midst of the room. Herod. My sonâyour father! Antipater. Majesty! [He prostrates himself. Herod. Your father! Stand! Let me know you. [Antipater rises and faces the King. . . . Seasoned! In my dreams I saw you as a lad, Antipater; Not of my height, my building in the frame, And round the eyes and temples mastership. Thin! You have hunted daily? Antipater (with a smile). Ibexes, Wild asses, the gazelle . . . Herod. And your gazelle-hounds, Had one of them my name? Antipater. No, Majesty, your name Was never lightly heard: or by the hearth, Or by the fountain of the sands, or under The shadow of the night-clouds, ever whispered; I heard it, and I feared it, Majesty. Herod. You had protection? Antipater. Obodas, King of Arabia, fed us. In his wars I was made warriorâall my camel-droves Caught from their pastimes on spear-rattling nights. Herod. Mature of body and of wits provided And sharpened for the pinch. . . . You have loved women? Antipater (again with a smile). All must have some suspension, Majesty, Some respite in the hollows of the sand. . . . Herod. You bring no wife? Antipater. Great Majesty, no wifeâ My filial love From the far-vanishing, the unblest plains: Although I drank you as a legend there, Although my mother told me of your youth, Although upon the desert was your name. Herod. My name upon the desert? Oh, the shrill, Shrill solitudes! You must not speak so fast, As crowding up the entry of my brain: If a long throng Of loaded dromedaries pass the gate, They must file two and two, not all at once. She told you of my youth: there let me linger! [Repressing Antipater. No, no! Her voice Soft as the flow of spicesâhush!â Do not break on me your impetuous voice, A hurricane of that sweet spice . . . [He looks at Antipater, as if gauging the years. She is dead? Antipater. Dead!âwaiting duteous at your palace-door, Waiting that in her eyes she may receive Again the mirror of your eyes, and then Home to her grave . . . The years are falling on her heavily. Herod. The way is very long for her! Antipater. But swifter She travelled than my swiftness and more eager... Herod. She must go back. What should she do among usâ Among the Mariamnes of to-day, Young wives, fresh voices? My Antipater, Being your mother, I must prize her so As the green sacred jade, no longer quarried. She must be hidden. Antipater (bending low). At your pleasure, lord, She will return . . . by stages very slow . . . Without my aid. . . . That will not trouble her, My lord, for she approaches to the shrine Of a dear idol: let her snuff your image, Fondle your feet, and creep back to the desert. Herod. She told you of my youth. . . . Have you yet found The thing she said, Antipater? Antipater. My lord, I am the thing she told me ofâyour son. She has reared me for you, father; for your pleasure. Each hour I passed beside her was religious. By heart she knew your first campaignâthe marching On IdumÃ¦a, held with three thousand foot, Four thousand horse.... The push toward Galilee, Its garrisons. The city Sepporis Seized as by magic in a wondrous snow: The sudden fight with robbers, the defeat, And then your left wing bearing down their right, So that they fled. . . . Herod. The left wing of my armyâNo, my right. No, no! . . . But fetch her in! [Antipater glides out. How marvellous She should rememberâand the critical, Grave point forgotten! . . . [Antipater brings in Doris: she falls at Herod's feet. Her veil is thrown back, and a woman with terrible head-dress is revealed. Herod recoils. A low voice is heard. Doris. Is he not fair, our son? Is he not wrought to your desire? My lord, Your blessing on him, yea, Your blessing on your first-born! [Herod sets Antipater at his right hand. He will guard you From all your enemies; no fear that any In secret any more shall trouble you. Now may I speak a little to my lord Of what this is to me to see his face? [Doris gazes up: there is a long silence. Blessing it is to me to see your face! Herod (uneasily). You are not dazzled? . . . And it is not seemly That you should look upon a King so long . . . Doris, for I am King of Jewry now . . . You must not . . . We are aged: time is between us, And I would spare you, Doris. It afflicts me To see your darkened cheeks. What do you see? Doris. I see all that you bid me seeâthe King. Before a crown Was on your head I saw it on your head! And it is not so high as I have seen it, Nor are the gems so bright. Herod. Your eyes are bright, your eyes that were my gems, Your eyes are brightening on me, and your face Is still as a still pool when stubbornly It shapes in its unruffled depths the sun. Doris, I thrust you to Arabia, So, in such youth. . . . What in Arabia Has been your fate? Doris. Herod, to guard our son. Herod. You had no second husband, when, still handsome, My little one, I left you? Doris. I was Doris, I was a flower, and the flower fades, my lord: You must not vex yourself that I am old. Herod. Depart, go home, go from my presence home! Salute your son. [Doris, without a glance at Antipater, clings to Herod. Doris. Your feet! [Then she rises, veiling herself, and moves away, as if set toward the desert. Herod (nodding). Farewell! . . . Antipater, This is a royal creature, of the wisdom There should be found in woman, of the beauty That is eternal in her. Royal, royal! And she shall be the first among my wives. Antipater, my first-born, draw her to me! [Antipater runs after his mother and leads her back. Sit, Doris, sit beside me, and our son Thus on the lower step at my right hand. Now I am made secure, now at the last I shall draw even breath. [Suddenly rising from his throne. Ho, eunuchs! Several enter Bring me A fanlike robe of state; bring me the chain Of amethysts, a pearl by every grape; And golden shoes and female crown of gold. Some others call The Princes to an audience instantly. [Antipater has lifted a hem of Herod's rich robe, and has been staring at the jewels. You catch my cloakâwhat is it? Antipater (quickly dropping the cloak). Your protection! [The royal dress is brought in and laid on Doris. Herod. Queen over every other queen! [The young men Alexander and Aristobulus re-enter, but draw back. My sons, Come to my feet and make obeisance here To this my wife and Queen restored to me; Then from my hand receive your brother's hand, My eldest, much-loved son's. Antipater, Your younger brothers . . . Alexander this, Aristobulus this. Alexander. I know Nothing of what you say . . . Father, I cannot Touch what is strange, and give away the name I call Aristobulus. . . . And this lady!â O father, I have counted every grape And every pearl she wears about her neck, When I was in the Queen my mother's arms. She wears that robe . . . the very robe My grandmother has worn, Queen Alexandra, Worn by my mighty ancestress her mother, And by my mother of the royal race. One day for this May she be dressed in sackcloth and be shut So close that she may never see the light That comes by the sun's shining! . . . O my brother, This woman is a crow that trails the glory, Our mother wore, before her children's eyes. [Herod, who has listened with growing admiration on his face, steps down to Alexander. Herod. Mariamne! (Softly in his ear.) Oh, beware! My Alexander, You are all mine, my creatures from your birth, To raise and to set down even as I will: You breathe upon this earth but of my will. I love you, Alexanderâbow to that As to an empire; to that eagle-ensign, I stream above you, bow! This agÃ¨d Queen, This brother from the desertâcircumstance, Nothing for you to stir against! My love An empire over you. [Alexander sobs on his father's shoulder. Child, by your race Of kings, and by the charge of you that CÃ¦sar Took side by side even with the world itself, Do homage to your lord's authority, Your father's. Show to this old Queen respect. Antipater, come here! Receive this hand. Antipater. I am in such amazement even as you: Forgive me that I breathed before your birth, Who never thought to see your faces, brothers. [To Aristobulus. But as bewildered and as in the dark, Let our hands touch, by the King's Majesty, [Aristobulus silently gives his hand. Herod, taking Alexander's, lays it in Antipater's. At the touch of Antipater's fingers Alexander lifts his head, his eyes flash into Antipater's, and he snatches back his hand. As in the dark. . . . Herod (to his Eunuchs). Lead forth Queen Doris, of the Women's Palace Queen. We all salute her. [Antipater kisses her hand; Herod leads her down the steps of the throne; Alexander and Aristobulus slightly incline as she is led out. Sons, We shall all hunt together in three hours. Your brother is a cunning hunterâibex, Wild asses, and gazelles he has hunted daily. (To Antipater.) Have you set chetahs on gazelles, my son? I have often loosed a chetah . . . [Alexander and Aristobulus have moved away down the terrace between the pomegranate-flowers and blood-red curtains. Herod turns from Antipater. Gone! Antipater laughs low. Herod shrugs his shoulders, and, putting an arm round Antipater, moves away down the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene A large, pillared hall, toward evening. Enter Herod and Augustus CÃ¦sar through an archway at the far end of the hall. They come forward talking, and stand together in the midst of the hall. Herod. Loved of CÃ¦sar! And this from CÃ¦sar's lips, in CÃ¦sar's actionâ Have you not given me gifts, Trachon, Batania, and Auranitis, With power upon my kingdom that my choice Confirm it to what heir I yearn unto? CÃ¦sar, on my new land, At Panium, of white stone of Zenodorus, Above the cavern magically deep, Prodigiously abrupt, full of still water, A temple shall be reared, guarding its symbol, That fulness of still water, and to you The temple shall be votive. Loved of CÃ¦sar! CÃ¦sar. With all the world to choose, his foremost choice! Herod. But, CÃ¦sar, you Who are as foster-father to my sons, Who are to me almost a foster-father, Enlarge the borders of your love, receive This stranger son, this likeness of me made So far away in youth. Admit him, CÃ¦sar, Among my offspring to an equal place. CÃ¦sar. Not with the royal childrenâno! Herod. Augustus, but the progeny is mine, They are all mine and of the royalty Conferred of Rome inherit. CÃ¦sar. You forget The AsmonÃ¦an blood; the royal gift To Mariamne's children, you forget. Herod, if I could soften you! Your heart Is rebel to her sons. Herod. But Alexander Makes no contention for my love . . . He and his brother are in league together. They do not walk away from meâtheir absence Is a discovery that tempts pursuit. Prove me this love of which there is no proof, Prove me my children's love! That they love you Leaps to the eye; that they adore their mother: That they are careful to displeasure me In every action, that they pass from me As the stars pass at dawning from the heavens. Yet am I never left! My first-born son, Whose mother from his birth was sure and faithful, Is ever in my presence, at my side. Achieve him with your favour! [An arrow is shot through one of the left arches, in front of Herod and CÃ¦sar. Antipater runs in, but drops his bow, seeing his father and CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦sar. Is the palace A ruined theatre, or a ruined temple, This most uncourtly hunter pierces through? Antipater, King Herod Desires for you a place among your brothers. See that the place rank high! [Antipater prostrates himself. There is silence. Herod. Is this the boon, Antipater? Antipater. My father, In these wide halls, and many coming in, And many going out, The footsteps but bewilder me. There is One footprint to my track, and one conception; I am my father's son; King Herod's son. Hold, hold me here! How should I profit CÃ¦sar, How, exile, dwell at Rome who from my desert Looked upon mortals as a cavalcade Of perilled merchants? Keep me at your side, Close as your shade, supreme in confidence, And with no other hope to my ambition Than to remain supreme. Herod (stooping to kiss Antipater). He fills the eye. Look on him, CÃ¦sar, look, how duplicate I live in him! CÃ¦sar. The young man has your voice, As musk, they say, carried a thousand miles, Will permeate that thousand miles, betrayed, As musk, in the rich currents of the sea. Herod, an irresistible appeal! (Shrugging his shoulders.) Let us to Nicholaus to see the scripts. [CÃ¦sar moves up the hall. Herod (lingering behind CÃ¦sar, to Antipater). Put by the arrows! Are you still a child? Quiver the arrows! Lay them by! I cannot hatch you into princeliness, As ostriches by looking at their eggs. For shame, Antipater! (Joining CÃ¦sar.) The scripts are written In choicest Greekâall I have done, and all That I, at price of labour, have erected, With thoughts that turn towards hope. But you shall read. [Exeunt. A hissing shriek breaks from Antipater Antipater. He is ashamed . . . Ho, ho, he hates me! I am dispersed, I am shaken as the dust from his mantle. He is ashamed of me before this CÃ¦sar. And the Greek . . . I will creep into the library. I will steal his manuscripts; I will pilfer . . . That one he hugged; I will keep the fragments in my bosom. He is ashamed of me. [Mechanically he breaks his bow over his knee as he snarls imprecations. Doris darts from an obscure corner. Doris. Do not chide me, do not be angry; I have waited in the darkness; have waited to spring on you as a pard. You are mine. Embrace me! Antipater. A queen, you can embrace me anywhere âbefore CÃ¦sar. You must not creep in, fugitive. Doris. What has befallen you, my son? Your voice! Has a wolf looked at you and made it hoarse? [Taking him by his shoulder boldly and giving him a shake. But you shall not speak like that to me, as though you were not my son. A husband can say to a woman, âYou are not my wife,â he can deny her; but a son can never say to his mother, âYou are not my mother.â Always a man must cherish his mother. His tent is her tent: till death they are together. Antipater. We are not in the desert now; we are in the court of a great King. Doris. A great King's court, where there are plots. I have discovered a plot. Antipater. Then discover it to my father: you are his Queen. Doris. It is not a plot that concerns the King's life. Antipater. Whose life? Doris. It is a plot of the Princes Alexander and Aristobulus. They are most discontented. Antipater. They are naught! Do not vex me with shadows. They are ghosts, as Queen Mariamne is a ghost. Doris, my little mother of the tents, you are a queen; you are wearing the ornaments of the dead. Of old we talked of nothing but this King . . . in the long nights, on the days when the sand did not move. Kiss me, for your lover is my lover. There is no one in the world like this King. Doris. Yes, indeed, Antipater, except you. You are more to me than the King. The King does not love me any more; he hates the movements I make, he watches my shadow . . . These ornaments are too heavy for me. I am not a Queen. But you shall be a King, my Antipater, and your brethren shall wait on you, as Joseph's brethren did obeisance to him in a dream. Antipater. Ha! Doris. I am all ear for you, my Prince, in my anxiety . . . and the faithful Bathylus. . . . Antipater. Well? But I would rather you did not consort with slaves. Doris. It is a letter from Prince Alexander's wife. Bathylus has picked it up . . . The Princess Glaphyra wrote it to the King of Cappadocia, her father. So Bathylus has told me . . . (Watching Antipater as he reads.) He says that the Princes are discontented and are making complaint. (Antipater whistles as he puts the letter in his bosom.) Antipater, Bathylus says the Princes hate you with bitter hatred. Is there anything of this hate in the letter? Antipater. It is a long letter. The Princes are children. Doris. Antipater, you must not despise the Princes. Herod is fond of them as of young roses; they are to him as the roses of Mariamne's garden. Antipater, see! the King is coming back and Alexander is with him. (She touches Antipater on the chest.) But you have the letter. It shall be as an arrow. Shoot it! [She disappears through a near arch. Herod (to Alexander). Then that shall be the order of the feast To-morrow! CÃ¦sar dull! We have hunted overmuch and wearied him. Alexander. CÃ¦sar is used to the arena, father. Herod. My little amphitheatre . . . here and there Clogged with disuseâfurnish it, you know how, Being half a Roman. Well, Antipater, You have wearied CÃ¦sar with wild gameâyour drove Round Etham of a hundred ibexes. He cavils at my hospitality, That proudly as a mirror held the pleasure Of Cleopatra mirrored . . . She departed . . . And shall the mirror now distort the glory Of CÃ¦sar? Why, Mark Antony returned me Continual wonder at my entertainment. Mark Antony, who lived upon great cities, Drawing their luxury to flower; and Greeks, King Archelaus among them, made me equal With high Olympians in my pomp of feasts. [Impatiently stamping before Antipater. You have abashed me . . . Ignorant, untrained, You must consult your brother, what he rules Being as an instant order. (To Alexander.) Star of fashion, If I were perfect in imperial modes, As when our CÃ¦sar young, and Antony Held banquets for me, I myself should stablish The feasts, the entertainments of the hour. To-day the ritual failed. I am abashed. Alexander (to Antipater). Fillets of boar and sea-fish followingâ Rome! what could CÃ¦sar think? Your oysters should be shipped alive from Pyrrha: They lay stale on the tongue. Herod. Enough! Be steward and dispenser of my welcome To CÃ¦sar, my young Roman! (To Antipater.) Well? Antipater. If the dessert were mean, we were awaiting From Syria figs and dates from Jericho. Alexander. CÃ¦sar will taste no dates from Jericho; The yards of Egypt fill his chalices. But, father, in my garden I have a vine of grapes like those in cluster That hang upon the doors of God, gold, fragrant As cassia by the beehives. I will cut them With my own hands, an offering to CÃ¦sar. [He runs out. Herod. How glorious! To pleasure meâthe speed! Antipater. A glorious flightâ A slippery ostrich, truly a swift bird, And very capable in flightâand all To pleasure CÃ¦sar. Herod (still looking after Alexander). My young Romansânot As you, Antipater, malign and wary, My panther, not as you. They are young Princes At any court, and where they are is Rome. I feared they would despise me; I am wrong. They are a little shy, a little jealous, A little haughty. (Putting his finger on Antipater's mouth.) Soft! Do not accuse them! . . . They will hint a fear CÃ¦sar will laugh at certain entertainments Esteemed a decade back . . . slip in new forms; And set aside, but not With jeering comment, what fastidious Time Has set aside. It is their pride in me. [Herod turns sharply, disconcerted by Antipater's sudden laughter. Antipater (holding out one of his father's long plats). Forgive the action! Alexander thus Held forth a trapping of his brother's hair, And laughed, âOur father's hair is deeper black, Is dyed so sumptuously that it shines A substance in itself, not variant As our young hair.â Is this their pride in you? Herod. It is their pride. They would that I should dye my hair more featly . . . Doris' white hair disgusts meâleprosy, White hairâthe plague! Antipater (laughing again). And they complain a little they must bend To walk beside you, so from age you stoop. Herod. You may in this take pattern of your brothers. Antipater. I was built of you a column, not a reed... Forgive it, fatherâthus you fashioned me. Herod. Antipater, I fear I set you up too high in privilege. Mark this: I have not drawn you from the desert To be a spy upon our royalties. I fear I have done ill so to remember Earlier, before my greatness, in my youth, I had a son . . . I drew you from my own obscurity: It is immense! The years I had condemned, My years, low-breathing to me with the breath Of sighing prisoners underneath the ground, Were yet my years of youth: Doris was there; And there, strange as the future to me, full Of promise as the future, was my son. Doris I guard for her fidelityâ Though but a winter-bough beside my throne, Nor shadow, nor delight, Why are you here, Save as a well of water from the desert, That I may drink in secret from its source? What are you? By your brothers you are nothing. [Antipater watches his father with twitching eyes; he keeps his mouth covered with his cloak. Antipater (in the folds of his cloak). I will not speak of them . . . [He moves away; but returns, dropping the cloak from his mouth. Father, I dare not Leave you so unprepared, before a purpose That will defeat you, as your heart laid open Before an enemy . . . and yet this letterâ A letter from the Princess Glaphyra, Writ to the king her father, Archelaus, As any letter full of cries for home, And messages . . . and one from Alexander . . . To your fond eyes and from a wife, though aimed Against your peace, may not disturb your peace. [Herod would snatch the letter. Not yet . . . not thus! So unprepared . . . (Struggling.) I will not, for I know your love is fixed On these fair Romans . . . No! Herod. What is it they have writ of me? Such things We write of one another in the frenzy And record of the soul! We write such words Of accusation when we love. I know That they would never plot against my life . . . They would not? . . . Torture! The torture that will never be suspended, That has no limit to its term, my torture, The question as I put it to myselfâ Could they so hate me? Antipater. No! It is not that: but as you make demand, And tax for revenue the secret treasure, And to its limit-riches, of the realm Your heart is lord ofâin your sight the wrong Your sons have done is such a wrong to nature, It is so opposite to all your prayers, It answers to your fondness as a stone Thrust in the hungry hand, stretched forth for food . . . A purposeâoh, but inconceivable! A purpose in relation to such fondness As you have lavished on my brothers . . . Father, You dote on them, you follow as a dog, Pine in their absence as a dog, make ring The palace with your cries if at a meal They fail or from reluctance shun the chase. You do all this, and . . . Herod (turning angrily on him). Well, Antipater, What do they do? Antipater (looking straight up as if in prayer). They purpose flight to Pontus; They ask for refuge from you at the court Of Archelaus . . . Inconceivable! . . . From you, their father, from the great King Herod, Loving them in his heart and with his pride. [Drawing nearer anxiously and laying the letter on Herod's knee. Father . . . they ask but refuge . . . They say you have no pity on their youth. Speak to me, father! Herod (standing erect on the steps of his throne). Bid them all come in! CÃ¦sar . . . bid CÃ¦sar come! . . . And Alexander . . . Have you heard my bidding? Antipater. Aristobulus? Herod. All, by any names . . . They have no names. Drag me the treason in! [Exit Antipater. [Herod descends from the throne and paces to and fro: then pauses in front of it, looking up. . . . They have fled from me, my throne! You are set up As a great marble seat among the sands, Idle and floated over by the dust. . . . This flight! It is more deadly than rebellion. Had they caught me in a gin and led me bound To the court of Archelausâa wild beast, We should have breathed hot on each other's faces, We should have injured one another: now They flee me and they are not injured. God Is injured in this thing that they would do, That would efface me. Or I am a father Bent over them, even as God bent over His creatures in creation, or I breathe With no significance, without avail. [Laughter is heard: Alexander and Aristobulus run in, each carrying a bunch of grapes tied to an olive-branch. They pause as if they encountered their father's mood. He speaks very low. Not parricide, but more unnatural, This fleeing from me . . . Honey of the rock The wild bees know and murmur of, and feed Deliciously about it: from the substance That is their life they do not make escape, Pulled downward to the virtue, nor of instinct Deny it . . . Blank before your sin, I see myself a king set up, and then Of death set down and not a king for ever. This crownâeven Mariamne Lifted her noble eyes on it! Her children Flee for adoption to a bastard kingdom, And would be almsmen to a foreigner. Aristobulus (throwing down his grape-hung wand and clinging to Herod). Father, we love you! If you loved us backâ We fled from your unkindness. Herod (to Alexander). Very haughty You, with your tribute, and unmoved. For CÃ¦sar This offering of your first-fruits. [Alexander is silent. Stubbornness! [Alexander purses his lips up to the grape-cluster above his head and bites off a grape. But thus your mother stood upon her trial, Her eyes above her judges, and, it seems, They said, I gave the whisper she must die. Aristobulus. No, no, we love you . . . No! Do not so thwart us from you. It was terror. Herod (to Alexander). And you? Alexander. Father, there is a condition to my love: You are abused to dream I do not love you, As you were deep abused, doubting my mother. Herod. But you have done this thingâyou wrote these words. Alexander. Where was my place? When you had slain my mother You slew her placeâah, then you truly slew herâ For you had kept her honoured on her throne Long as that throne was vacant: in white robes I saw her, and the movement of her robes. I cannot see her any more: her absence Is violated by an effigyâ You have the stranger wife, the stranger son. . . . Herod. You love me . . . stay! And Mariamne loved me? But these words Are as great victories in lands so far The distance makes a glory in itself. You never gave me sign Of any love you bore. If this were truth! Alexander. Truth. But there is condition in my love . . . Banish Antipater, that I may love you, For I am jealous, father. Herod (suddenly folding his right arm round Alexander). Are you jealous? Are you indeed come back to me from Rome? Jealous and angry for meâyou, her children? You are indeed come back to me from Rome! [He draws them both into his arms. Conceive! . . . If you should fail This my infinity of love and shrink From this confusion of you with my being . . . [Binding them closer. For you had fled from me to Archelaus, You would have kissed the lips of strangers, breathed Air that I did not breathe . . . Your feet were turned, Pointed away from me, as feet of corpses . . . There, do not trouble . . . There, you must not weep! If it should be my doom! Conceive! [His voice dies away, as he loses his sons from his clasp. (In a whisper.) They cannot! [As CÃ¦sar, with Antipater, enters, Herod moves forward, trailing the Princes along with him in each arm. I called you, CÃ¦sar, To be our judge and to decide among usâ And yet I fear you cannot. By a tempest Being suddenly subdued, the elements So writhe in me I can but call on you To listen to the moaning of a wind. Will you not call this madness? CÃ¦sar. The offence? What have these children done? Herod. Nothingâindeed, A thing too small for punishment; and yet Revolted soldiers shrinking from their legion Need not so blench. CÃ¦sar. Accuse themâ For either they will clear themselves, or clear Their bosoms of their guilt. [The night falls. Herod. If I accused them, How should you take account? You have not brooded Over a word through solitudes as long As Time itself. You draw to a tribunal Defects and flaws so delicate, their nature Is perished ere they reach the Judgment Seat. How shall I speak it? I had waked alone To-morrow, I had sought them as my love Led me to seek them furtively in sleep, Or in their morning laughter: and the slaves Had stretched the carpets to my face and feigned They knew not of this flight from my unkindness. My palace had been sorrowful, as if Death had been planted there, and presently The happy news had come that they were safe From me, in refuge from me! They desired To live with Archelaus. CÃ¦sar. Then banish them A little while to Archelaus' court. They will repent. Herod (covering the Princes with his eyes). O CÃ¦sar, One does not banish children. I am old: I love but roses . . . I am growing old. Alexander. Banish Antipater! CÃ¦sar. It is well spoken. Banish him, Herod. [A cry like a fierce wild animal's is heard. Herod. How has he offended? Where is his lack of love? And his ambition Is to be ever at my side. So quickly Can I forget? CÃ¦sar. Among our idols, Herod, One must be master-idol. Break your heart, If it must be in twain; let not twain break it! [There is a deep silence. Herod looks round; an obscurity of the suddenly-fallen darkness is on all the faces. Herod. Why is this silence? Is it that the night Is coming on, when all contention yields? Armies lie down, with hatred in their breasts, Almost together for the sake of sleep. So must my sons lie down . . . And for the sake Of the great power that would renew them kindly, And all their gifts invigorate. [Silently the Princes steal away and Antipater crouches on the ground. This council Is broken up! [He waves his hand. I cannot see their faces . . . It is faded. I cannot see them . . . and they are not banished. [He makes a groping movement and is approaching Antipater, when CÃ¦sar arrests him and leads him back down the hall. Their tread is heard, and the sharp breath of Antipater.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene A half-dark lower room in the Palace, filled with dim, antique treasure. A door at the back; far down to the right another; and in the wall to the left a narrow door and a high, grated window. Alexander, Aristobulus, Corinthus Alexander. But you must examine this treasure. Corinthus. I have no mind to examine it. It comes from the sepulchre of a dead King. Alexander. It comes from the sepulchre of David. My father has visited the sepulchre. Corinthus. He has rifled the sepulchre. [Alexander and Aristobulus walk among the sunken objects, as if they were kicking dead leaves. Alexander. Confusion! And what strange images decay has set upon these heaps . . . this glitter among the dust and this breaking to pieces at a touch! Corinthus. It is horrible. Alexander. Fie, Corinthus, you are old before your time. It is not horrible to secure these jewels from the dust. Corinthus. Would you be buried with them? Alexander. I shall be buried royally. I have no fear for my funeral. Heigh! But we have here a magnificent canopy. Come, Corinthus, help us to set it up. You will not? Aristobulus! [The youths set up the half-broken canopy. It is royal! Have you not observed my father has been much more intimate with us of late? (Patting Aristobulus' head.) Younger! Twin monarchs in a little while. And all this golden furniture our own. [He opens the lid of a coffer. Corinthus. It is very gloomy here and desperate. Can you not wait till the slaves have received orders concerning the distribution of the furniture? Must you come here, like spies, picking over the jewels? Do not touch them. Come away. Alexander. No, let us pick, pick, and rifle . . . Kings, you know, rifle the sepulchres of Kings. It is a royal custom. Belts and jewelled swords! See, Corinthus, a present after your first campaign. But this! . . . (he takes up a crown) the sockets for the jewels in this diadem are empty. Aristobulus. Yes, they are empty. Corinthus. They are staring like empty eyeballs of the dead. Alexander. That is how it looks to you, pale Corinthus. I am in favour with my father now, and I shall present him with this unfurnished coronet for repair. Amethysts . . . and again emeralds. [He turns the crown about with his fingers. Corinthus. Where is Antipater? Alexander. Banish Antipater! Corinthus. Antipater does not steal down into these chambers to handle the gems in the King's treasuries. Aristobulus (lifting an old sceptre). Do not concern yourself with Antipater. I no longer concern myself with him. We have the secret . . . flattery! We can flatter our father to his bent. He believes, he actually credits, that we are only happy in his presence. We repeat that he is our darling, that we only value existence for his sake. He credits us. Alexander (crossing the room restlessly). I shall never flatter my father. It is natural he should love us. Fathers do set their hearts on their children. [Alexander, who has been playing with the crown, sets it on his head. Corinthus. The King! [Enter Herod at the back; he comes along, straining as if with a burthen, though he carries nothing. His head is bare; and his long, black hair wild in disordered plaits. He stops before the canopy. Herod. Spectres! [He passes on, turns back as if to assure himself he had seen true. The sceptre drops from Aristobulus' hand. Herod rushes out. Those who have followed him pass out after him. Corinthus. Why did I consent to come to this place? Should my father find me here he would rank me impious. Alexander (dashing the crown from his head). Impious, but we are impious. I fear we are ghostly children to our father. He took us for spectres. Aristobulus. We are doomed. Alexander. He is doomed, the King, our father, CÃ¦sar's friend. His face! And he thought we were spectres. We are to him as ghostly children. We have broken from him,; we have fled from him. (Stopping suddenly in horror.) We have been to him, he said, as young roses, as the smell of the roses of Mariamne's garden. He has said to us again and again that we were as the balsam of the balsam-trees, that we wafted spice to him as from the lost balm-yards of Jericho. He has said we were to him as Rome, as the days of his lustyhood with Mark Antony. Aristobulus. But his hatred . . . Alexander, it struck the sceptre from my hand. Alexander. No, noâhe does not hate us. He turned back with that face, I remember, when we were children, and our mother dead, we implored he would send us to Rome. So great a King and we have dishonoured him. Corinthus. If he were reasonable like my fatherâ Alexander (staring with contempt at Corinthus). He gives alms to the world of his unreason. He is immense, and has the movements of a god. CÃ¦sar is astonished at him, and trembles at his tenderness. The whole world is astonished. Aristobulus. You speak so? He murdered our mother. Alexander. Peace, peace! He did not murder her . . . peace, peace! Corinthus. Then you judge she deserved her death, that she did mingle the poison-bowl? Alexander (striking Corinthus). My mother, Queen Mariamne! But there is not in our blood anything that could injure him. He overwhelms usâhe is too terrible . . . My mother! Did she once plead for her life that you should think that the King murdered her? Enter Tero from the back O Teroâspeak! For I fear my father is gone mad. I fear we have undone him. He spread on before his retinue like a wild, limping bird. He was alone . . . without ceremonial. Have you missed him? Is there truth in this apparition? Tero. Come away from these accursed things! I came from a tomb, and I beheld you, young creatures, as in a tomb. Away with you! Go! Aristobulus. We cannot go up to the Palaceâthe King clanged the door behind him. We cannot move. It is forbidden. Alexander (going up to Tero). What has befallen my father? Tero. It is almost forbidden to speak what has befallen him . . . There was stench from the tomb and dishonour. I heard groaning, and then a great whistling noise like a curse. He issued with a cry of âRebellious childrenâAbsalom, Adonijahâchildren that were a-hungered for his throne, children that would have put him to the sword.â . . . And you were here, playing with these baubles. He passed you in his frenzyâyou are lost! [The door into the treasury is thrown open and filled with the spear-points of soldiers. There are soldiers also at the outer door. Aristobulus. I knew we were doomed. We are in this tomb for ever. Alexander. Tero, let me see my father; entreat him to speak with me. Pass these soldiers. [Tero advances. Tero. Why are you here? Give place! I would speak with the King. The Centurion (advancing). You shall speak with the King and of what nearly concerns him. Follow me . . . Let your son come too! [He advances toward the little door in the left wall. Aristobulus. Do not leave us, Corinthus. Corinthus. My father is arrested and my place is at my father's side. My place is with him. Tero. Is the King there? I would speak with him. Centurion. He will question you, Lord Tero. He is within. [The little door shuts behind them. Aristobulus (creeping up to Alexander). It is the door Of the torture-chamber. . . . Alexander. Yes. The other door barred and with Gaulish spears. (With a low laugh.) ScyllaâCharybdis. . . . Aristobulus. We shall hear? Alexander. Tero is constant in his faithfulness, Dear, noble Tero. . . . Aristobulus. He will save us. Listen! A throng of voices . . . I must see! [He draws a golden stool to the wall and stands on it that he may look through the grating; but the old seat collapses into dust and he falls. Alexander (raising him). No, no! Not spies! No, it will come to us Over the air through stone . . . Hush! A low rumble like a hornet's nest . . . I can hear nothing but the angerânothing! . . . Tero's reply, lost in his beard! A Voice (below the grating.) My father, True, they would wear your sceptre and your crown. Oh, you beheld the truth, And what you have yourself beheld, uncensured, I may affirm. Aristobulus. Antipater! Alexander. The asp! Antipater (within). And I affirm they hate you from the blood That bred them; of their mother's life they hate you; And by her death they hate you deadlier still. Aristobulus (shuddering). A groan! Alexander. Not Tero . . . Hush! Antipater (within). And I affirm they hate you in the surfeit And steadiness of youth: to glut elation Of their cold arrogance, they crave your life, Your sceptre plundered from their mother's race. [A deep groan. You fed them with your heart's Red blood-drops, with your wounds, as in the desert The pelican, vulning itself for offspring, Bleeds in its piety . . . and they! My father, but to speak their thanklessness, Should turn the tongue into a cruel stone. They crave your death and they would murder you. [A cry. Alexander. He must believe it, having seen us. Aristobulus. Tero Will save usâTero, You know, will save usâTero . . . Why are you silent? Antipater (within). Proof!â You ask? A picture still before your gaze? Did you not see the sceptre of King David, The crown wherewith he crowned King Solomon Held in possession of their hands? The sceptre Of David and the crown wherewith he crowned King Solomon, his son? Kings of JudÃ¦a, virtual as the line Of AsmonÃ¦ans, with whose blood your sons, Being fruit of Mariamne, are composed. Kings they would be by right and not through CÃ¦sar: Nor is there accusation of their love That is not of hot truth. They seek your life By implications so implacable They are as murder; and abhor your presence, That is to me unweariably sweet; They jest at your great majesty. My father, For them you need no proof . . . perchance for me, Unhappy, torn from the wide desert-plains, Set 'mid the jar of royalties, for me You need, alas, a surety . . . who might seem A serpent to destroy the pelican's Heart-cherished brood . . . This man, This Tero, private to your children's hours, Told me, when in a crevice of the hills . . . You found us there . . . that with great bitterness The Princes had besought from his tried bow, Amid the negligence of hunting-hustle, An arrow fatal to your life, my lord. [Turning to Tero. Is it not true that when we were hunting together, yesterday at noon, you confessed that the Prince Alexander had urged you to cast a dart at his father, as if by chance, to murder him? Herod's Voice. O David! Rebellious children, desiring my blood. Absalom, Adonijah! The curse from thy tomb . . . O David! Alexander. I cannot hear Tero's reply. . . . Antipater (within). You hear he confesses he spoke with me at noon yesterday; but he says it was on far other matterâthat I should withhold you from visiting King David's tomb. He makes me a liar. We will have the truth. Herod's Voice. Bind him! [A pause and scuffle of feet. Alexander hushes Aristobulus. (A Voice rings out.) The Princes are innocent. Antipater (within). And now, and now? A Voice. Innocent . . . Ye Gods . . . innocent! Slay not the innocent blood . . . Aristobulus. Tero will save us . . . will he not save us? Why are you silent? Alexander. Through this man's courage we are saved. A Voice (in a faint scream). Innocent! [There are cries and sobs, then a terrible shriek. A Voice (high and wild). I cannot bear it any longer . . . I will confess all . . . I have heard the Princes wish you were dead; for the sake of their dead mother they have wished it again and again, hating converse with her murderer and that they should live with him. . . . Again and again they have yearned to appease the ghosts of the dead. Again and again they have coveted your crown; again and again they have told me your wives should be shut in tomb-prisons, alive and despoiled . . . They would bury you as a slave . . . they deride you as an old man; they laugh when they have yielded to you in the hunt some creature they could themselves have killed long before you perceived it. They laugh at your Roman fashion of long ago. They reproach your justice as wild and polluted; they swear they will accuse you to CÃ¦sar. Alexander (to Aristobulus, who falls by his side). These are moments of our lives . . . these are words of our lips . . . We must die. Herod's Voice (within). Unbar the door . . . Give me my liberty. He enters, his Guard behind By youth you are condemned, not by old age; By this Corinthus, by this boy, who could not Suffer his father's straining cries . . . (Panting.) who snapt The living bond of fellows and the fancies That bind the young with threads of gossamer. How should they hold? [Advancing nearer. He is traitor to you, children; He has unpacked your wild, exasperate thoughts, Your curses, your contractions, all you muttered Against me as I turned to mount my horse. I often speculatedânow I knowâ What of conspiracy behind your teeth Was hissing at me; for he poured forth all, As Tero waxed and shrivelled in his pain. He could not see his father at such strife; And to the torturers, who stayed their hands To bide his chanting, sung us all your story. False from the firstâfalse each of you, and then Confederate in your falsity. Sometimes Laughing in note of my infirmities, Sometimes forecasting the felicity, With smile and golden candour, of my death; And in my softer moments, when I clung And fondled on your beauty, sometimes feigning. But Mariamne did not this, she feigned not; She never feigned to love . . . O eloquent! He could not bide his father's pain! And youâ This my exposure were an entertainment, And a diversion to you; it were matter For many foolish jests, save for this power Within the substance of my flesh to doom. You tremble . . . it is well . . . for now my trembling Is not a hollow beating to itself. Aristobulus, you are pale. My sons, You shall be put far from me at Sebasteâ Some day you shall be strangled there: that day Live you expectant of . . . not of my death, Your death. I shall not fix the day of doom. Agenor has the death-ring safe. And while You wait in torment and suspense, my torment Shall ghost beside you. [Coming still nearer. Have no fearâyour tombs Shall be most royal; you are sons of Kings. [Madly he weeps, stretching out his hands toward them. Alexander. Hear me! Herod (turning his head back and closing his eyes). I will not break your beauty up By torture, and I will not hear your cries. Be still! Laid by your mother's side for ever, One on each side, at Alexandrium . . . How often have I seen this in the night! Be still! It is a vision . . . It prevails. [He makes a movement of blessing over them, and is drawn back fainting into the Torture-Chamber. The young men for a while remain speechless. Then Aristobulus sobs, while Alexander stands, with his eyes fixed on the closed door. Aristobulus. Corinthus! My age within a day, our follies grown As on a single stem . . . he took the babble, The fleeting malice of our tongues to kill us. O miserable! Alexander. We must forgive Corinthus. Would I could serve my father in his sort! [The Guard enters by the inner door of the Treasure-Room, led by Antipater. He mutters a few words, among them âSebaste,â to the Guard, then props himself against the wall, white as a spectre. At the sight of the Guard and its leader both Princes hold themselves indomitably firm; they are bound in silence and are led away, following each other, through the outer door. Antipater. I wonderâis his voice still in the vault? I heard it from behind as a sea's roar Before me in a cavern . . . Terrible! I have not trapped him to the heartâmy sentence âGo from me, leave me, see them bound.â My sentence, My condemnation! And these miscreant children, Doomed to Sebaste, he was blessing them; His heavy, heaving breath Was laden with their namesââAristobulus, . . . Her children . . . Alexander . . . Mariamne.â While I, who am himself, And of himself and like himself, a shadow In the dark water of his very substance, I am dismissed to bind them for Sebaste. Shall I escape? Noâhe shall not escape! An Arab, he has knit his kingdoms up Into a kingdom, and I am himself, And I am famished as he famishes, Am lonesome of his lonesomenessâmy father!... The hate, the broken blood about my brain! [The door above is opened; Herod gropes down with a lantern, though the light is still blue daylight in the doorway through which the Princes have passed. Herod. Why are you here, Antipater? Where are your brothers? Antipater. You have doomed my brothers to death; they are passing out by yonder door. Herod. Ay, banishedâit was the will of CÃ¦sar. [He passes his hand over his eyes and laughs with closed mouth. Antipater shudders. What are you doing here, Antipater? Antipater (shrilly). I am picking up the echoes in the Hall of Judgment . . . I am ready to follow my brothers. Father, an outcast! [Herod looks for a long time at the wide-open door; then he takes up some jewels, running his fingers through them. Herod. Do you prize these things? Antipater. Not these! [He raises his eyes and fixes them on his father. I desire to be with you, to be your only one. Herod. You desire my crown . . . O Antipater! [He, in his turn, shudders; then climbs heavily, but with speed, up the steps. Antipater rolls on the ground, biting the dust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Scene Beside the fountain CallirrhoÃ«, in the desert by Jericho. A black Arab tent, the skirts drawn aside, discovering a throne and cushions in a half-circle. On the left of the tent, the fountain fills a basin in the rock; on the other side, stretches a desert-horizon, barred by a ruinous, little turret. In front of the tent a brazier is alight. Herod bows over the fountain. Herod. It is my new toy, this fountain of CallirrhoÃ«, and it gives me power to be alone . . . For they will leave the old man by the springs for his healing. Doris does not plague me. They think I am comforted of the murmur . . . This fountain is my new god. It laments for ever: its woe never stanches. I should like that my God should have a never-stanching woe, I should like to comfort my God! I should like to listen to the story of His wrongs. If indeed He were a Father! If He knew how the heart clogs! . . . There is such loving in me! I should like to be as Abishag to David: I should like to be as a maiden to warm the heart of some old god. There is such loving in me! I figure to myself this fountain as soothed that I remain at its brink . . . I will be faithful. [Doris comes from within the folds of the tent and stands by the brazier. There is Doris! She is shivering, and she looks over the sands. Doris, little wife, what are you straining for? Doris. Herod, the wind blows too hard by the fountain. You should return to your tent. Herod. Yes, presently. [He tries to catch her hand. Doris (throwing back his caress). Do not heed meâI am old. [She goes back into the tent. Herod. âI am oldâdo not heed me.â She says we should not heed the old. Well, we are all white-headed; we must all begin to live to ourselves. Snowy councillors! Nothing but snow round me! Doris, snow-white! Balbus and Nicholaus, snow-white too; all my councillors, snow-white. The old are so silent to one another. It is snow, snow! [A troop of children runs round the tent and dances round the brazier. Then the troop runs off. (Calling.) Children! . . . They do not heed; and an indulgence in me lets them alone. They will come presently and let me down into their world and transform me. I shall become like a goldfish among a darting group of goldfish in the pond. They have no interest in anything I have done, and yet I have never displeased them. [Little Herod Agrippa returns from among the children and stands square before the King. Herod Agrippa. Grandfather, you have built the Temple at Jerusalemâwhat shall I build to God? Shall I build another Temple? Herod (drawing the boy to him). You shall protect the Temple I built; you shall keep it safe as King David kept his flockâsafe from the bear. You are stronger than the lion or the bear. You shall protect the lovely House. Herod Agrippa. Will that please God? Herod. It will please God. Herod Agrippa. I shall be made High Priest, and enter the Holy Place when I am King. Herod (groaning). No, no! You can never be High Priest: it is forbidden to the Race of Edom. Herod Agrippa. Grandfather, I shall be made High Priest, and I shall set up the Golden Eagle the young men have plucked down from the roof of the Temple. Do not groan any more. I shall set up CÃ¦sar's Golden Eagle to protect the Temple. Herod. God would have none of my images. You must not set up the Roman Eagle: it is accursed. Herod Agrippa. But CÃ¦sar, grandfather, is always the friend of God. Herod. You must not be dreaming of CÃ¦sar. God holds I have desecrated His Temple with the Golden Eagle; He has cast it down; He has cursed it; and I have fled to the desert. You must love the Temple, you must be ready to lay down your life for the Templeâbut remember, child, God will have no images . . . [The boy fidgets and slips off. Just as one could pour into youth some wisdom, some power for its seasoning, youth escapes. [Herod Agrippa's laugh is heard behind the tent. I perceive there can be no exchange of gifts between the young and the old. How I abhor these children! We shall play no more together, for I have confessed to them I have offended God. O my God, how I love Him and have offended! . . . They are all dead that trampled my Golden Eagle, for if my people deny me the care of God's House, then shall my people perish! . . . I have come to the desert to die, and I have none to die with. One should keep one's children for this hour. When we die we are in the desert and we need that one should give us drink . . . some passing caravan . . . some relief! Antipater! Antipater! Now I have grasped his name, I am saved as if from drowning! There is rumour he has left Rome, and, uncommanded, returns to JudÃ¦a. He is on his way . . . I will send messengers to speed him . . . Now I am sick I must remember my first-born. Easy to my faults, overcome by my excess of powerâ Antipater! Ah! shall I draw to me those eyes that glittered, fastening to the sapphire on my brow? Those void eyes that stared at me for the crown-jewels, as if I were dead? It shall be a test to tell him I am eaten of the worms. Will he be my nurseâAntipater? [Doris has been standing behind him. He turns and sees her. O Doris, you quicken at the name. We are old . . . It is lonesome . . . See, there is a little fire; they have lighted a fire. [He crouches down by her under the brazier. It is long since your Antipater went away to Rome. Let us speak of him. (Spreading his hands out in the flame.) Let us speak of him and his return. Doris. You have forbidden me to speak of him. Herod. No, no! I have forbidden you to speak of the dead. (He surveys the fire.) It is very lonesome, and in the flames there is nothing of the future. We sit by the flames and they glow . . . and they speak to us of their young days . . . of all they have wrought, the cities they have destroyed, the sacrifices they have consummated; how they have played with the tombs, how they have had their pleasure with the dead. (Rising.) Not with my dead! No, my dead are not buried Roman! They are very fair. No, no! they are not murdered of the flames. Doris. Herod, you have a living son; do not speak of the dead. Herod. I would be patient with you, Doris. You have been very faithful. You have waited my pleasure and I have sufficed you. Doris, it is hard on you I am so sick; it is like slow dying to you . . . For you would not care, would you, to live any more when I am dead? Doris, why are you stammering? Doris. My lord will not die. Herod. Yes, little Arab, little Arab Queen; I am dying before your eyes. You have watched me and you have not wept. Doris (at his feet, caressing him). Let him come back to the fountain: let him drink the waters of healing. My lord is my life; he is the light of my days. [Herod suffers himself to be led back to the fountain. Herod. Will you give me to drink, Doris? [But Doris is standing petrified before Salome, who comes suddenly from behind the tent, with a phial and parchment in her hand. Salome. Hold, hold! Herod, you must not take anything from her hand. There is conspiracy. You must trust no one about you. Herod. O Salome, this is an old wordâconspiracy! You have arrested me from drinking many a draught that would have healed me. I will not be arrested by your liesâso familiar the voice of this temptation, bidding me believe Mariamne unfaithful, and my slaves unfaithful, and my children unfaithful. Leave me alone! I will drink. Salome. Then my business shall be with the Queen. I am the bearer of a letter to her from her son. And I must read it to her alone, for she cannot read. [Herod rises to grasp the letter; the cup rolls into the fountain. Herod. Do not shiver, Doris! You are faithful. There is some miscarriage, and whatever the children have done you are faithful. [He takes her hands. Doris, these hands were warming at a brazier; Why have they sunk so cold? Patience, Salome! There are some words the agÃ¨d must not hear. They must not hear of children that are false; Nor must they be accused, not in their age. Patience! Salome. No patienceâfor they are in leagueâ My Arab lover and your Arab son; And Sileus has himself . . . Herod. Ah, Sileus, is it? All plotting and mirage! Do not be childish; We must not be so childish any more. If Sileus in his wrath with me, because I would not wed you with him, seeks revenge, That were a little thing. [Turning slowly away from Doris. It is not Sileus Can set my brain to rock in dizzy circles, Can set my heart to moan among the hills. If from the north, the south, the east, the west Spreads apprehension, it is all the same, All from one quarter: . . . Shall I read your scroll? Salome. No, no! you cannot see. These are the words: âMother, there is for thee within this box That which will make Antipater a Kingâ Sileus' young mistress in Arabia hath Devised the poison. Sileus is my friend.â Herod (grasping her wrist). You have played at this before; my cupbearer Would poison me, you said, and Mariamne, You said, had mixed the cup . . . She, innocent! I have come to see so wide an innocence, Spreading like sunlight on the battlefield . . . I will not be impatient. Presently A criminal shall drink this in my sight. Salome. So did one drink beforeâso falling downâ Herod (raving distracted) . . . . This letter, stay!... [She unrolls it before him. Each reed-stroke on the page Antipater's . . . Has never reached its goal. Salome. But question Doris. Do you not see she trembles? Herod. She is old, And she is very fond; needs must she tremble. If this (lifting the scroll) should prove its nature as a truth, How should she bear the truthâshe is too old. [Doris falls, clasping Herod's feet. Doris. Herod, but you will spare Antipater? Have mercy! . . . He is hasting to your tents. Do with me what you will . . . His enemies Are thick upon him, and your ears so quick, So open to all evil . . . Herod, listen . . . We have such terror of you, and the phial . . . I am ready. I will drink it in your sightâ Drink it, it first You will make oath to spare Antipater! [Herod stands erect, silent; Doris rises startled. As if unconsciously, he begins to strip Doris of her ornaments. Herod. Salome, See that the sentries keep guard, but if This son that, as it seems, is drawing home, Approach, at his demand, let him pass free. [He goes on stripping Doris of her jewels. Goâ Salome, call my counsellors to aid me. Let Balbus come and quickly Nicholaus To aid me: draw them round me in my tent. [Exit Salome. By now the ornaments of Doris lie in a heap on the floor. Doris. Is it for death? What would you do with me? Is it for death? Herod. Chains! Amulets! I am unfreighting you, my camel, I Who loaded you so costly. [He examines the jewels one by one as he takes them off; some he wrenches, others he lifts in the air and smiles as they glitter. Ah, a thing I had forgotten, I remember nowâ I bought it from an Ishmaelitish lad. I am glad to have it back. Ho, amulets! To work their fascination and effects, As still birds on their nestsâthese chains, protections, I armed you with all these; these kept you faithfulâ Away! This pearl that rose between the breasts Of Mariamne, like a valley-dome, Now among ruts and gritty warts . . . Be patient! These are my bridegroom-hands and should be deft . . . The knot miscarries of the jasper-stones; And here a collar that I cannot snap! Let it alone! Are you quite stripped, quite bare? [He takes her by the shoulders and pushes her out behind the rock of the fountain. Now you shall go back to the wilderness. [Covering her face with her hands, she runs out toward the desert. I thought she would be tethered to my grave, Chained as my camel, and to rot beside me . . . But she is gone, is strayed . . . Antipater! Would that these sands Would sweep up solid round us as a wall, That I might hang upon his neck and spread A deafness through my senses to aught else, Save that he is my son! [His Councillors begin to file in. But even now The pitiless, wise faces congregate; And in my bosom it is growing stranger Than any foreign land. I cannot kill, I cannot give award . . . There is Shemiahâ He pleaded with me once for Mariamne; He pleaded I should put her in Masada, Not take her life. [He goes up tottering to Shemiah. Shemiah, I have use For something that you offered. [He takes and fondles Shemiah's hands and paces a little along with him. At that hour I could not use it. Offer it again, Shemiah! Look, it is a day of doom: I must make accusation. But your part Has ever been that of petitioner. Of me you made entreaty for the Queen That I should spare her . . . Your unanswered prayers Have broken in upon my sleep . . . The hour Is now propitious . . . (Pointing to the others.) They will give a judgment Remorseless, of no patience. Counsel me Your way of gentleness. When they condemn, As presently they will, beseech my mercy. Shemiah. I cannot, King! [Herod turns swiftly away from Shemiah and faces the Councillors: he stops before blind Babbasâthen slowly takes the throne. After a struggle, he begins to speak. Herod. It is not of one matter I would speak. It is of many kingdoms, the revolt Of many kingdoms, and an amnesty Is in my breast . . . a pardon. Do not tempt To make my breast a den of raging lions. I cannot bear the noise. I am accused; And many are accused. Antipater, And Dorisâand Salomeâand myself. Give me protection; let me feel your presence Around me as great wings. O my beloved, Wait with me on the moment! In my bosom There are such changes as from day to night; More fervent and of peril more extreme Home from the night to day. I judged in darkness: Now as the light shoots down on me it shows A spectacle so wondrous, in my awe And in my joy and terror at the vision, I watch, I guard the vision, but for judgment I have no faculty. Be round me, let No fury slash into the glassy sea! Sustain me of your love! Nicholaus. We cannot, King. Herod. Aid me! Nicholaus. We cannot aid you: not to mercy. Herod. No, no! You are not aiding me. No, no! You cannot aid. [He descends the throne. Babbas, I saved your life, I spared you, I was gentle . . . There is darkness Now in my heart, so fierce an eddying pool Of darkness! I am striving for my wits. We all should be at prayer, making atonement For this great evil that is done. I would Abase myself in penance: but no instant Is given me for my tears. Babbas. You are weeping, Herod. Herod. Babbas, you do not see . . . Antipater Has ridden swift, is now at the tent-skirts. Babbas. I hear His slippery, quick feet. Is he alone? Herod. He comes in purple, and he beats the ground Wildly as Cain . . . [Herod drags himself back to the throne, then hides his face in his hands. There is a great silence: Antipater, entering, kneels at Herod's feet. A voice is heard, as if a stranger were speaking. You thought to find me here Dead at your feet. (Bowing on his hands down lower.) I live . . . And I can grant petitions: whisper me. [Antipater half-rises, glancing round the circle; then he kneels again and whispers. Antipater. To be your son, your heir, to have no rival, To be your own for ever. Herod (planting his hands on Antipater's neck). Sycophant! O desert-tongue! You thought to find me here Dead in my tent. And now we shall enact Your deed in effigy. Give me some wretch The judges have condemned to death. [Slaves are despatched. Before These holy men, you shall behold his death, Even so effecting mine in effigy. [An old condemned criminal is brought in. The sentence of the law be done on you! [Herod takes a goblet standing on a table by him, and pours the poison into it: but he draws back his hand from lifting it and commands Nicholaus. Give him the cup to drink! Drink, as an infant from his mother's bosom; Drink as in happy confidence. O happy! A sucking child! [The man reels, falls convulsed, and dies. This is an image! You And I and Prince Antipater are seeing Another, not this criminal, another, As old as he in years and many sins. Look! but the wrinkles straighten. All is judged And done and imaged. Take the idol hence, Into the dark . . . for we have seen the sight Of which it is the carven stone, we all, I, you, and Prince Antipater! Now speak, If you can heave up action to the lips . . . [He watches the corpse being carried out. Ha, but this hanging face! The hair not dyed safe to the silver roots. O man! O image! Dust as yet of stone; Dust, dust! O elders . . . Aid me! Nicholaus. We cannot aid youânot to mercy, We who have seen the picture in this deed, The swiftness of the venom. [Herod again covers his face with both hands. Antipater (in a shrill voice from the ground). It was venom Deadly and flashing deep: it was the venom Bred for you drop by drop. It was a cup For you to drink and was prepared for you Out of my banishment. (Kneeling upright.) I am your bloodâ I bear no absence and I bear no rival. You drew me from the desert, from the race You had forsworn, the race of Edomâslowly You took my love out to yourself. As creatures, Wild creatures, a wild horse, With black-brimmed eyeballs, or a wild dog tamed Give passion of the desert to their master, I gave my ecstasy . . . You had desired That I should tarry by you in your sleep, Lest any should assail. I watched you breathing, I watched your sickness; I have seen your eyes Ravished of fondnessâyou, so hard, you care For waking and for sleeping and for breathing Without my voice to waken you, my touch, My kisses . . . I contrived your death, As you contrived the death of Mariamne. Yet she could live without you and beyondâ I cannot live like that, an animal That being left of you upon the shore Dies on the shore. [There is silence. [The silence continues unbroken. And where you love you killed:â Mariamne, doubting of her love, and jealous That she should love the air by which she lived. Your sons, who would have loved you had you trusted That love you levy, but you would not trust . . . They plotted, grew more distant, and were strangledâ You gave the word to meâwithin Sebaste. So, in your likeness, of your very nature And colour of your passion, in my rage, Exiled from you at Rome, and knowing you But as a mourner for my murdered brothers, Being of your temper and your jealousy, I could not think of you alive. You know, Father, that lustâby Mariamne's fate, And by the fate of well-loved Alexander, You know that lust. And to extinguish it You have another victim. [He creeps close to his father's feet. I will lick These dregs up from the floor, in all their venom, If you desire my death to satisfy That great exasperation that in Kings Craves massacre, or that a single object Should perish slow and of deaths multiform. [The attendants restrain him. . . . But if indeed Compunction take you, if you have such love That you would grieve for me, and start on journeys To turn home suddenâas for Alexanderâ Then you may spare me, father; I am yours! What will the days be to you if I perish? Nicholaus (to Herod). Give judgment! Speak! For Prince Antipater The judgment of our wisdom is, he dies, And for the sin God most abhors. He is, Attested by his hand, a parricide. [Unrolling the scroll of the letter in Antipater's face. You sought your father's life, your father's throne. What will the days be to him if you perish? Safe days! Antipater (addressing the Councillors). They had been safe if he had made me The apple of his eyes! But his eyes turned Away from me as from a bloody field; But his voice shifted in its tones the moment It must respond to me. The way he moved A little distance off at my approach, Involved me in the silent certainty I was an exile from his heart for ever. I plotted for his lifeâill have I plotted. Nicholaus. Give judgment, King. Herod (removing his hand from over his eyes). There was a counsel, elders, And from young lips, Banish Antipater. I will not take your counsel, but that counselâ Banish Antipater . . . a little way, Almost within my sight and yet removed . . . Yon little fort . . . not far. Remove him from me, If that to him is punishment. Remove him A stone's throw from my presence and my love. Antipater (in a murmur). You have tried Rome, the miles of separationâ Venom, my full response. Near and yet severed . . . . It whirls the death-sands! Herod. Take my son away, And shut him in the little desert-fort. Antipater. As Mariamne in Masada's fort, Beside the Dead Sea beach. . . . Herod. So, as I loved her! Antipater. And safe as Alexander and his brother, Shut in Sebasteâsafe! . . . Your fortalice is full of scorpions, owls, Adders and stoups of water in the floor . . . [He stands with outstretched arms, and shrieks. Sebaste! No, my father, not a fort! Herod. I follow counsel sent in oracle. And I have heard you speak of love as echoes Speak of far voices to a listenerâ Echoes about the rocks and little towers Of wildernesses . . . Take my son away, A stone's throw from my presence and my love. Antipater. Sebaste! Father, but they did not cry, They did not tell their love. You heard no sound From Mariamne, Mariamne's children; You do not know they loved you, and no echoes Leap from the dumb. Herod. They were of royal raceâ Impenetrableâsealed. (To the guard.) Take him away! He gnaws worse than the worms that eat my life! He would have killed me, as the worm that kills. Away, away! [He sobs. Antipater. My mother, let her plead! Beside you, faithfulâand no echo! Nicholaus. Prince, The lady Doris, who had mixed the venom In treacherous wine, now wanders on the desert, Bare of all honour and all ornament. Herod. Away! It sullies love to bandy words. Away!âto walls deaf-mute and deafened doors! Antipater. Your feetâone kiss! [They restrain him and he is forced away. He turns at the tent door. What will your life be to you if I perish? [Exit Antipater guarded. With a wave of the hand Herod dismisses his Councillors, but holds back Nicholaus by his cloak. Herod. Bring me a draught of water and an apple... It seems, I have not eaten for a month An appleâ That red-blush sort that creams up to the knife. [Nicholaus whispers to a slave, and himself goes out of the tent, returning with water from the fountain. An appleâ How slow you are, you do not give it me! Nicholaus (as the slave re-enters with the fruit). On the instant it is plucked, and from the bough You shook but yesterday. Herod (greedily). They are ripe applesâ Yet ripening, snatched From the voluptuous doting of the sun. A little sharp . . . I am fainting, Nicholaus. This faintness of sick appetiteâit goads me; It will not let The sunken camel drop upon his knees; It will not give me privilege of death. Nicholaus. Wine, there is wine! Herod. The juices of the apple, The curdling juice. [He takes a knife and begins to pare the apple. There! I am satiate. How tenderly it eats. Nicholaus (watching him). Why, King, this is your wont; you are recovered: And we shall have you in our midst. Herod (stopping in the paring). We? Who? Antipater? [With a sudden revulsion of feeling he attempts to stab himself, wounding his arm as those round him snatch the knife. Then he faints. Nicholaus. Hold, hold! Madman, you shall not! This is sacrilege: You shall not dare, you, an anointed King. (Cries heard all round the tent.) The King is dead. King Herod, he is deadâ Is dead! The King is dead! Herod (opening his eyes). O Nicholaus, God took the knife, and gave me of this swoon, As safe as balmy water: Jericho Has no such balm. What is it I had dreamed? And can I die as Moses of a kiss? Enter Jailer Jailer (to Nicholaus). The Prince Antipater would bid me loose himâ Is the King breathing still, O Councillor? Herod (suddenly raising his head). Antipater would come? . . . Why would Antipater Be loosed? Jailer (with a salaam). You being called, O King, Across the sands as dead. Herod. And in what heart Would he be loosed to seize the crown? The Jailer. With fury, And one long laugh. Herod. His sentenceâlet him loose To judgment, to the Dark of Hades, night That swerves not! Kill him, send him forth to judgment! Call the Centurion of my guard, and with him Join half-a-dozen soldiers. Kill my son, As you would kill a bear or straying lion Among the homes of men and vales of corn. His is not of our palaces. Strike swiftly, But swiftlyâfor wild creatures give the slip To death with stratagems. Then bury him Ignobly, not within the royal tombs, But in my city of Hyrcanium, That looks from high upon the desert-strands, The pits and the acclivities. [Exit Jailer. A laugh! O Nicholaus, and I had shut him up With heat of secret visits in my heart . . . Of how I should slip down to reach him, scarcely Biding to-morrow in my loneliness, He in his loneliness. O Nicholaus, When I was young I heard the cries and wailings Of Arabs when their dead are carried out: I thought there were in him such cries for me; But on the air news of my death went forth, And there was made no cry. Call me Salome! Call her, for I am dying. Call her! I have a purpose lest I die Too hard for one that dies in solitude [A slave is despatched. . . . Is she grown negligent? Year after year I drew the creatures that I love down to me; I drew my doves to call. It is my wont, It is my pleasure, and I love to seek them, To find them in the chambers unaware, Breathing without suspicion or asleep. And in her niche I ever found Salome. Not to-day . . . Yet she is coming. There are many tombs All round me, and no mourners round the tombs; That is not well. Nicholaus. CÃ¦sar will mourn you, King. Should not that be enough? Herod. No, no! These times Are so disordered they disorder God, And He is grown unnatural . . . Hereafter There will be none to love Him in my fashion, So royally, with so vast a pomp. Hereafter He will lament me. Nicholaus. He will bring to mind Your zeal for Him. He will forgive your sins. Salome enters Herod (raising himself). He will avenge my wrongs. (To Salome.) I have provided, Salome, all my lands shall weep for me. It is a sound that in my sepulchre Will drive the winds away. You are astonished? But I have ever comforted the dead With lamentation; all my leisure hours, And in the night's long idleness, and when My power hath rested on me as a crown, I have lamented . . . First for Mariamne, First and for ever . . . for the boys Cut off, that bore her image . . . for the child Of Doris, and for Doris, that lone mother. . . . Salome. What would you do, my brother? I am oldâ Herod. Ay, it is that! And I would have young voices, And women's voices, and the cries of children, As they had lost their mother in the wilds. I would have young men wailing for their fathers, And women wailing for their husbands slain. If thou art faithful, thou wilt pledge this thing. By Edom thou wilt pledge me, by my first, Most ancient home . . . There must be sacrifice! And all my chiefs once reverend to my heart, Whom I had so delighted in, who would not That I should rule them, in a host must perish. They shall be gathered in the hippodrome Slowly as twilight musters on the plain. It is my will that they should muster there To hear some new decree, or for a council, Or for the execution of some doom. There let them tarry till my funeral, There let my soldiers kill them one by one. [Salome shakes, as if palsied. You have but ill-conceived . . . I must be mourned. Let there be many orphans in the land! Salome. They will but weep their fathers. Herod. From those tears A race will spring that shall outshine the sun. I do not fear To make of children orphans, or to lay On any noble heart calamity . . . No hurt done when the tents are broken up; There is no hurt By fire or pillage; it is when the slave Makes accusation, when the child is hard, When the wife gives no comfort of her beauty That the land fades away. Let there be orphans; Let there be many orphans in the land; Young ravens too that cry for bread, and bleating Of many flocks unfostered on the plains. My son Antipater Struck at his chains, would burst them in his fury; He cried exultant when they cried me dead . . . The world must be set right again. Salome, The kingdom of the world cannot be saved, Nor can the harvest-field yield up her fruit, Nor can the moon rise up except in blood, Unless the young with tears lament the dead. Salome, are you faithful? . . . Speak! [He falls forward on her neck, dead.</field>
