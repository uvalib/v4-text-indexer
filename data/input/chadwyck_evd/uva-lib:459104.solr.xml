      <field name="fulltext">To the Ghosts of Hannibal and Scipio. Where e're your thin remaines, and shaddows dwell; In the Elysian blisse, or paines of Hell; I, that with writing of your story new Am almost worne into a ghost like you, Present you with your selves: such as you were When you breath'd ayre, and had your beings here. Let not hells Iudges damne it to the fire; It past mens sentence: there's besides some hire Yet undischarg'd; and where the debt was due Being deny'd, I have sent the bill to you, Say not for money, how shall we come by it? Borrow of Pluto: he will not deny it Vpon your bond. Stay: here's a great mistaking; His state and riches were of Poets making: And they I feare so apt are to belye him, I cannot think he hath one penny by him. How e're your patronage shall doe me right, 'Bove the prefixt name of a Lord or Knight: Or other outside men: such as inherit Of honour but the title, not the merit. Who think that if the least state action rest On their dispatch; or to a Christmas feast They yearly call the neighbour-hood; or be Put in commission, or the Shrivaltie (The Countreys highest grace) they may dispence With what belongs more to their difference, Bounty unto desert. But you are free; And if you might would rather come to me, Then put me to a charge: the journey's great, And ere I could return, I might want meat: Vnlesse some kind poore cobler, (you know well Mending of soales is no rich trade in Hell.) Lend me a shilling. Loth I am 'tis true At any rate of hopes to come to you. The honourer of your memories, Thomas Nabbes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Ghosts of Hanniball and Scipio to the Authour. What charm commands us hither to repayre? And once again salute the upper ayre? Would Lucian vexe our shadowes? make us tell Which of us holds priority in Hell? What art, that do'st with thy Poetick fire A soule into each Histrio inspire Like ours? and make them move with active rage As we did, when the World became our Stage? We know thee now: thy thinne cheeke, hollow eye, And ghostlike colour speak the mystery Thou wouldst, but canst not live by: for the more Thou do'st enrich thy works, they make thee poore. Who will by fancy and invention thrive, Must practise how to flatter men alive. We would have left thee provinces, hadst thou Done this whilst we had being here: but now Pluto restraines our bounties; else wee'ld be Not ayrie patrons to thy work and thee, But give thee crowns of Mettall, whilst thy brows Others did deck with cheap Phebean boughs. The singer of the Punick wart had bayes Making our acts his subject; and thy prayse Should be no lesse. But we are empty things, Though once we aw'd states, and commanded Kings. Hannibal. Scipio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Another Tragedy? What will become Of the soft Muse? Shee'l shortly have no roome On this transform'd stage. Ladies shall not blush, Nor smile under their fannes: nor he in plush, That from the Poets labours in the pit Informes himselfe for th'exercise of wit At Tavernes, gather notes. Stay, I should be A Prologue, not a Satyre. You shall see A piece from a rich subject drawne; but how The workmanship will please, and you allow Th'imperfect colours and the weake designe, Let your owne judgements tell you, and not mine. The Author warrants us the story's cleare; Vnlesse to fit the Stage he doth transferre Some actions that were ones to other men: The places sometimes chang'd too for the Scene. Which is translated as the musick playes Betwixt the acts: wherein he likewise prayes You will conceive his battailes done, and then The methode shall appeare, in which his pen Hath smoothly drest the argument. 'Tis free As ever Play was from scurrility. Nor need you Ladies feare the horrid sight: And the more horrid noise of target fight By the blue-coated Stage-keepers: our spheares Have better musick to delight your eares, And not a straine that's old, though some would taske His borrowing from a former play. We aske Your patience but two houres, by which time hee Shall either dye or live to Poesie.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">[The first Act.] The Argument of the first Act. Hanniball reprooving his Souldiers for their lasciviousnesse at Capua, is himselfe taken with the love of a Lady of Salapia. Newes is brought him of Scipio, that hee hath recovered Spaine: and a command from the Senate that he returne to Carthage: which with much unwillingnesse hee assents to. The Scene Capua. Scene the first. Maharball and Himulco. Mah. Here's the right use of victory, to tame Our furies with soft ease and wantonnesse, After so many travels. Had our Hanniball Possest himselfe of Rome without a Capua, The conquest had beene poore. Himul. These spoyles of beauty, And free ones too, that uncompel'd will runne To imbrace a Souldier; rock him in her armes; Sing him asleepe, and with her icy fingers Kembing the knotted curles of his black haire So long neglected, make her selfe the ravisher: Oh! 'tis Elysium. Mahar. Nay, to have such change Of pleasure court us; as if their inventions Were onely busie to make our delights The object of their care. Here we are feasted With Chalcedonian Tuning; Rhodian guilt heads, And more than Samian gluttony. We drinke No wine, but of Campania's Mascicus, Or grape crownd Aulon. Boyes more faire than hee That beares Ioves Cup, rapt on the duskie wings Of's sky-borne Eagle, serve the banquet up In golden dishes, or Corinthian plate, Luxuries chiefest. Him. To crowne the entertainment, Here sits a Lady, Hebe never blusht A colour like her cheeke: and in her eye A thousand Cupids move in wanton friskes, To catch the gazers. There's another deckt In the Seas riches, which the Negro dives for: Her pearles reflexion dimacing the darke tapers, As if all light were borrow'd from those Sunnes Their orient roundnesse mockes us with. A third Betrayes through a transparent lawne the beauty Of a complexion, white and red did never Mixe a more perfect; and a shape exact As Natures first Pandora's. The possession After desire hath made a preparation In every sense to entertaine these joyes, Can earth affoord a Heaven, and this not bee The best hope ever faign'd? Mahar. Then to be cloth'd In silkes of Tyrian dye; to sleepe on downe, And waking claspe a Goddesse in ones armes, Lovely as Cytharea; revell sometimes, And dance to th'Mermaides musicke, 'till the night Is made one artificiall day, inverting The course of time and's actions: oh delights, Beyond weake comprehension! Wee begin To taste them without sense, did not diversity Whet appetite anew? Him. Yet so much change Should make invention barren: but 'tis fruitfull, Pregnant, and teemes as fast as 'tis delivered. Delicious Capua! Mah. Pleasures onely storehouse! Were I an Hanniball? and conquest quiet me As faire as day-light spreads his christall wings. One Capua should ransome all. Scene the Second. To them a common Souldier, with a faire Lady courting him. Him. What's here? Shee courts him with as earnest zeale, as Cynthia Would her Endymion, or the gray-ey'd Morne Her earely Cephalus. Mah. Now by my Sword. Him. Is that a Souldiers oath in Capua? By the bright tresses of my Mistresse haire, Fine as Arachne's webbe, or Goshimere: Whose curles when garnisht with their dressing, show Like that spunne vapour when 'tis pearl'd with dew. Or by the Sunshine of her christall eyes, Wherein the God of Love his wet wings dry's After his bathing in sad Lovers teares. These are the onely oathes a Souldier sweares. What should we doe with swords? Mah. Indeed 'tis true Their bloody use hath beene so long neglected, And for my part I am so cloy'd with women, Mine must bee fil'd to powder, and prepar'd To bee their Physick: the greene-sicknesse else Will not bee cur'd by me. Him. Mine shall be drawne To weare for pinnes: and that which oft hath raign'd The blood of Romanes on my hilts and hand, Wearied almost with slaughter, shall bee toucht With trembling fingers, white as Othris snow; Whilst the soft handler starts, if by mischance The point but prick her skin, and must consult With some learn'd unguentary to prevent Th'invisible scarre. Why here we cannot quarrell Amongst our selves for wenches. There's a Lady, As meane a beauty heretofore hath beene The ground of a sad warre, or in a Campe Stir'd up a mutiny: wee cannot envie it, That he, a common Souldier, valours ciphar, One onely prest to make the number up, Enjoyes her wholly, and perhaps hath change. Mah. Nay, stands upon nice townes for his reward; And must bee hir'd to pleasure, such as some Would even through any danger to embrace. Prethee observe. Lady. Why should I be deny'd? Am I not faire enough? My beauty fresh As the new springs, when wan on Phœbus mounts His burnish't chariot early to salute her, And kisse dew from her cheekes. Soul. There are as faire And free. A pension Lady must be thought of; I cannot else be sportive. Lad. Is that all? Ile fill thy burgnet with Iberian gold Stampt into medals; Sell my wanton treasurie, Rings, Iewels, Carkanets, e're thou shalt want, But what thy wish can covet. Soul. This old buffe Would be translated. Lad. Into Persian mantles, Richly embroydred; no rough pelt of thrumbes To fight with weather. Shalt be cloath'd in silkes, Such as may vye for touch with their softnesse When it is calmest, and no violent gust Doth wave it into wrinckles. Soul. I must eate too. Lad. Nothing but choycest candies, and drink wine That shall have pearles dissolv'd in't. Come let's hasten To our delights. I have prepar'd a bed Of artificiall Roses mixt with downe; Wherein our dalliance we will emulate, The Cyprian Queene and her lov'd warriour, When in her Ivory armes she did imbrace His Iron sides. Soul. Soft Lady, there are yet Stricter conditions. 'Tis not come to that. I must not be confin'd to times or place; Nor to your single number. I must change As I see cause. Lad. Shalt be thine owne disposer. Ile minister, and like a hand-maide waite When thou wilt grace another; nor repine, But with a patient longing. Soul. On these termes I feele a provocation. Come. Exeunt. Mah. Did ease Ever before produce such acts of shame? Him. No matter. 'Tis a better life than warre Affords her sonnes. A hard cold bed of earth: Sleepes broken with a thousand apprehensions Of danger; diet course, and seldome seasonable; Hunger and thirst; and death each houre presented. Let us translate our Carthage unto Capua; We shall not need to toyle in blood and sweat For more inlargement. Scene the third. To them Hanniball. Musick. Husht. Our Generall. Mah. How doth he like this softnesse? it agrees not With his rough nature. Hanni. Musick every place Surfets with this lasciviousnesse. A Song as from some window. March on my merry mates To Venus warres: You need not feare your pates, You shall receive no wounds nor scarres, You may come naked to the fight: Wee'l have no other veile but night. Onely you must not see The blushes of your enemy. Chorus. The loving battail's set, And we begin To counter meete With active striving who shall win. I faint and yet mee thinkes you yeeld, Both lose, and yet both winne the field. Recover strength, and then Wee'l to these pleasant warres agen. A fight. Bravely maintain'd, and well come off on both sides. Curse on this ease. Y'are well met noble Captaines, How doth your courage brooke this silken slavery? Is't not an easie bondage to be ty'd In bracelets of a wanton Ladyes haire? And chayne your daring spirits to the awe Of every glance her eye shoots? Tell me truely How doe the pleasures of this Capua Relish upon your senses? are they not Even what desire can shape? Mah. They are my Lord Most absolute. Han. And you are pleas'd with them? Him. They cannot bee refus'd, being offer'd us So aptly after labour, as the fruits And harvest of our paines. What stupid earth Can be so void of apprehension, As not to thinke them blessings? Han. That can Hanniball; Who through the swarthy vizard age and cares Have tann'd his face with, blusheth at the change Of Souldiers into women. Why in stead Of Plume-crown'd crests weare you not tyres? and deck Your neckes with gemmes, instead of arming them With Corslets? Lay by all command, save onely To set your distaffe-servants taskes, and study Lascivious dressings, not warres discipline? Better employ invention how to court A Mistresse in the fashionable garbe, Than to contrive a usefull stratagem Where force prevailes not. Mah. Whom have we to fight with? Lead us againe to action, wee'l expresse A courage doubled by this little rest: And from the hopes of such another conquest We will act wonders, to make victory Dote on our valours. Han. You like Carthaginians Speake from the soules of men. Muster your Souldiers: We will againe to Rome, and with the terrour Of our approach make earthquakes in the hearts Of her gown'd Senators; burne the proud trophees, Adorne her Capitoll, or make them scar-crowes: Bury her high-ascending Towers in heapes Of their owne ruines; and till Tyber's dy'd With bloud of his owne children, not an arme Shall cease from slaughter. Have we cut our way Thorow Mountaines, and thaw'd rocks of Ice for passage To reach the head of Rome, and shall we not Triumph in her rich spoyles? Yes; we will triumph. Or by the Genius of my native Carthage, And the religious oath I made my Father, When yet my youth had seene the progresse but Of nine sunnes through the twelve celestial mansions, Ile levell all the rugged Appennines; And mount the humblest valleys, 'till their heads Be wrapt in clouds; whence thunder shall not force me, Till I survey the playnes of Italy, Like earth manur'd chalkt with the bones of Romanes, After their flesh is buried in the gorges Of Kites and Vultures. Him. Speake like Hanniball. Scene the fourth. To them two Ladyes. Han. What Lady's that? Mah. Shee's of Salapia. Han. She's lovely. What unusuall passions Soften me on a sudden? I me thinkes Could play with ayre, and wanton with the breath Of such a Mistresse: court her amorously, And not mistake a phrase, nor fright her tendernesse With any repetitions of warres horrours. Cease your rebellion thoughts. I must be man, And keepe my freedome. Han. Dost observe his eye How it is fixt? Han. What did creation meane A woman for, but pleasure? Should not I Pursue it then since 'tis the end of all We either doe or wish? 'tis actions soule That makes it live. I must enjoy it this way. Desire's a law set downe by natures Counsell, And not to be disputed. Mah. So my Lord! Example shall direct us: we may well, If Anniball turne Courtier. 1. Lady. One at once. Sweet gentlemen. Though I should covet change At once I'de not admit plurality. Han. To you (faire storehouse of your sexes excellence) I would direct the language of my heart. 2. Lady. 'Tis sure a noble dialect, my Lord, That must expresse it. Han. Lady it can speake. Nothing but passion. You have wounded it. And from the selfe same eye that shot the dart I must have balme to cure it. 2. Lady. Y' are my Lord A conqueror; and may command the wills Of all beneath you. Han. But I am your captive. And in that pleasant bondage would abide, Though I might force my ransome. 2. Lad. Violence Would it become those vertues fame proclaim's To have possest you: and I dare be confident Nothing could tempt you to turne ravisher, Though I should boast virginity. Han. Suspect Of such an ill, wrong's your owne innocence. My love is zealous, and the passive flame Fed with a pure desire. I would enjoy you To mixe our soules, not merely to delight The wanton senses. 2. Lad. How can you, a man Whom custome hath habituate in th'extremes Of cruelty, change nature? and perhaps Your first, innate, and not a second, onely Borne out of use. Me thinkes it is not possible Your thoughts should be possest of other objects, Then what warres horrour paint's with bloudy colours. Love and a Lady are for such as ease Hath softned into women: Hanniball Hath nothing in him, but what's masculine: So hardned too, that those weake fires can never Alter his temper. Han. Yes; your eyes have done it. Although my skin be horney, and my flesh Almost insensible through daily weight Of heavie armes, the substance of my heart Is flexible, and takes impressions Of love from your perfections. It not derogates From the best difference in mans composition To love: for that best speakes him man, and argues Hee hath a spirit capable of things Worthy his being. Come then perfect me With your addition: make my captivity A conquest, and Ile fixe. 2. Lad. That were enough To brand you with a lasting infamy. You have designes for action. Should you stop The prosecution of a warre begun With such successe, and onely for a woman, T'would make you be the scorne of men; the subject Of jesters libels. I could court your valour As you are Hanniball: but as a lover The thought of that cooles all affection. Had I at Cannas beene, or Thrasimenus, Guirt in an Amazonian male, my head Wrapt in an Iron tyara, and my hand Arm'd with a sword, I would have kept the side Of Hanniball, to dote upon those wonders His conquering arme then acted. Han. As from water Cast on bytumen, so from these sharpe checks My flame encreaseth. You expresse a soule Makes others valours but derivative From yours; as if the spring of all flow'd thence; And we but dranke our small proportions From your abundance. Our embraces would People the wasted world with Warriours. Scene the fifth. To them Nuntius. Mah. Whence speakes your hast? and what? Nun. I come from Spaine, And bring important newes; but sad. Him. Shall wee By change ride through the Zodiack of your pleasures, And feast our selves in every house? 1. Lad. You still Mistake the signe. Mah. 'Tis not in Virgo sure. 1. Lad. Nor yet in Taurus, though I have a husband. You two are Gemini: a payre of—Captaines. Him. Shee flouts us sure. Nun. What should this courtship meane? Maharball and Himulco that were character'd For valiant Captaines, turn'd smock-souldiers? And Hanniball? 1. Lad. The ayre of Capua Hath not so chang'd us, but we can preserve Our modesties. Mah. Oh miracle! that Capua Hath honest women in't. Nun. Will Hanniball Attend my message? Han. Hast thou brought her pearles Ravish't from necks of richest Romane dames? I'le pave the path we tread to Hymens joy With spoyles of all the cities I have conquer'd. Nunt. Not of new Carthage; Sagunt; Locris; Tarracon. All these are re-orecome by Scipio; In Spaine he onely triumph's. 2. Lad. Doth not Hannibal? Minde the sad newes? Revenge if nothing else Should wing him to new conquest. Hanni. I perceive Errours in my behaviour. Court a woman, When I should threaten vengeance! But shee's faire. Hang beauty: that and ease are th'onely engines To ruine vertue. Ladies pray' withdraw: Th'affaires of men are handling. 2. Lad. May they prove Your honours more in valour then in love. Exeunt. Han. I am prepar'd: and if there were an accident That did exceed in horrour, praise or wonder, Discourse it lively, that it may impresse Some thing within to beget an act Shall parallel it. Nunt. That must be new Carthage Her siege and taking. When the Romane generall Approach't the walls, a cold feare shoke her Genius: The earth groning with weight of such a multitude. His Navy likewise at that instant made A cloud upon the Sea. So round about The citty was beguirt. Our resolution Mix't with despaire soone arm'd us; and th'assault Being suddaine, we did doe before consider: Yet what we did thus with the wals height proving Successefull, we had respite to advice. The Sea we thought sufficient to defend That part it washeth, and directed all Our force to th'Isthmus: where we sallied forth. The enemy retir's; but out of policy To draw us farther on. And now the Sunne Survey'd us from his heigth; when suddenly A violent North-winde joyning with the ebbe Swept all the channell dry. Of which the Romans Being inform'd by certaine Fishermen Seize th'opportunity, and freely passe To th'unman'd walls; entring without resistance. What more they, being fully conquerors, did, Need's no relation: custome shew's it Hannibal. Th'example made some other citties yeeld; Some policy wonne; some force; some trechery Deliv'rd up: all are possest by Scipio. Han. Then Rome shall ransome them. Revenge is able Out of a flinty cowardize to strike The fire of valour, with that new supply I doe expect from Carthage we'l to Rome, And emulate this victory; nor let it Be your affliction that blinde chance hath rob'd Your former labours of their due reward; Rome will repaire all. Scene the sixth. To him Bomilcar. See Bomilcar's come. Cozen what answer send's the Carthage Senate To my demands? Thy lookes speake discontent; As if the busines of thy errand choak't Th'unwilling passage. Vtter it; my brest Is proofe 'gainst all misfortune. Bom. I must then Deliver a relation of ingratitude Beyond example. Those whom you have made Masters of wealth and honour, and releas'd Their palsied age from many a coward feare, Not minding the rich benefits you have done them, Deny your need reliefe. If you want ayde, They say your conquest's but a lying rumour: Nor will they credit doubtfull testimonies Of any presents. They not stick to call The ground of this your warre in Italy Your owne ambition, not their safety: malice Of Hannos faction having fram'd pretences To cloude the glory of your actions. Which to confirme the more, see their command That you should instantly withdraw your forces, And so returne to Carthage. Han. Not till now? When in my tallons I had almost seiz'd Romes Eagle, and prepar'd my sharpned beake To prey upon her heare? Bom. Tis likewise fear'd That Massanissa hath forsaken Carthage. So that unlesse some policy can winne Syphax unto us, we must never more Expect Numidian ayde. His Counsailours Seeme to desire it; for they wish your presence: And that you'l put th'instructions here contein'd Into a sudden act. Han. Must I then leave Rome unsubverted? So a man that strives To make himselfe eternall by erecting Of some stupendious monument, is forc't To his last quiet e're the worke be perfect. Leaving it but a lame and halfe designe Of his ambition. Him. Hath not Hanniball His forces here? Let's forward with that strength Which yet is left us; nor regard the tyes Their doting policies would chaine us with. Valour consists in hearts more than in number. Let's on to Rome. Han. No: passion shall submit Vnto my best part. Conquest of my selfe Shall speake me more in this, then if my power Had level'd her seven hills. I leave her onely To grow more worthy of my victory. I will obey, though each unwilling step Wounds me beyond the cure of common patience. Commands of power must not be withstood. Great actions make men great; good actions good. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The second Act.] The argument of the second Act. Hanniball and Scipio meet accidentally at the Court of Syphax: who favouring the Romanes, and being a young man, is wrought upon by Hanniball, to dote upon Sophonisba: who after much unwillingnesse exprest, and reflexion on some former love shee bare Massanissa (who had beene the Carthaginians friend, but now become the Romanes) is given to Syphax for his Wife. The Scene, the Court of Syphax in Cyrtha. Scene the first. Syphax, Piston, Crates, Attendants. Pist. 'Twill prove I feare lame policy to hault Betwixt these factions, aw'd by two such spirits, As ne're were still'd from envie or revenge. Syph. Brave Hanniball; brave Scipio; great Carthage; But greater Rome: whose Eagle eyes have gaz'd Against the Sunne of many a glorious triumph! When the bright beames reflected from their riches Have blinded day-light, as if heavens great eye, Borrowed his onely from them. Crat. Carthage is Our ancient friend, and friendship long continu'd Should not be easily lost. Syph. A usefull tenent Where the condition's private; but in Kings It doth not hold. Warres chance is variable: And he that now is victor may be conquer'd Before his peace be settled. From example We must consult our safety, more than from A morall precept. Hath not Scipio Got Spaine from Hanniball, and joyn'd unto him Massilia's King? Are not their armies flasht With the rich spoyles of Sagunt? and who knowes But they'l transport their forces, and begirt Carthage it selfe. 'Tis better that we yeeld Freely to amity, than be compel'd, Than Scipio must bee welcome. Pist. But if fortune Prosper my counterplot, he will be greeted With an affront shall cloud his entertainment; And dimme the painted glory of that pompe Your complement intends. Our youthfull King Must not direct our counsels; nor affaires Of state be order'd by th'affection Of one so weake in policy, indulgent To his owne passions. Carthage is set downe By our experience for Numidia's love, And shall possesse it. Syph. We may then consider, The Carthaginian Generall is a man Worne with imployment into more decay Of strength and yeares, than can give any hopes Of a continuance. Romes greene Champion Is full of growing sappe to make him spread. Whilst the other like an aged Oke that long Hath fought with tempests, and withstood the rage Of burning ayre, now yeelds to every gust. A bough or arme, 'till one more violent Shatters the dry'd limbes, or quite roots it up. Tis better to provide for lasting state, Then meerely to prevent a present fate. Then Scipio must be welcome. Crat. But if Syphax Would heare our reasons. Syph. Crates you have beene Our worthy counsellour, and by your wisdome Stear'd government in a right course whilst yet Our youth did want it: but we are now growne Riper in judgement, and we can distinguish To them Messenger. The different grounds of any politick act. Nor doe we finde it safe in rules of state If Scipio be not welcome. What's your hast? Mes. The Romane Generall is arriv'd, and entring. Syph. And no faygn'd thunder to informe us of it From the lowd voyce of flocking multitudes, Should throng to bid him welcome? Mes. Hee's scarce knowne To any but my selfe. His traine is private, Without due state: onely some needfull servants To wait upon his person. Syph. Were they his army, I would exhaust my treasury to feast them: And every common souldier should drinke healthes In his Corinthian Goblet, which should be His largesse likewise. Let our ministers Fill the shrill throats of warres loud instruments. And Dodonean brasse be beaten deafe Whilst it proclaimes his welcome. Let the Sea Eccho the sounds to Sagant, and returne Their shoots agen. Flourish. Scene the second. To them Scipio, Lelius. Welcome great Scipio. Never did Syphax joyfull armes imbrace A guest of so rich valew, in whose minde Worlds of heroick vertues are congested To make him up a worthy. Scip. I'le not answere Your kindnesse Syphax with a complement. My tongue's not oyld with flattery. I have stolne A little time from action, to informe Numidia's King, how Rome, by my advice, Hath chosen him a favourer of her cause That suffers by false Carthage. The successe Of my recovering Spaine, hath given new hopes Vnto her fainting spirits, that were neere Their last expiring by the massacres The Carthaginian made. Sixe Consuls have Already fall'n: my Father, and mine Vncle; Sempronius; Terentius and Flaminius; And last Marcellus, who receiv'd his death Even in the sight of Rome. Yet there's a Scipio Surviv's to conquer him, or dye in th'enterprise. Syph. And that brave Scipio shall not want what ayde My person, or my Kingdome can affoord him. Scip. Rome shal make great esteem of Syphax friendship And when she shall be wrapt in silken wings Of victory and peace, his statue crown'd Shall grace the triumph. Pist. I should rather joy To see him chayn'd a captive, though my selfe And family were sold to be his ransome, In Carthage quarrell. Scene the third. To them Hanniball, Himulco, Maharball. Han. This cold entertainment Doth make me jealous. Crat. See: how soone their eyes Have found each other? Scip. Sure 'tis Hanniball. His name and nature's stampt upon his brow; I in those wrinckles read it: valour mixt With cruelty; to which ambition onely As the first wheele in engines moves the rest. That eye he lost passing the fennes of Arnus; And such a looke his counterfeit is drawne with, If there be trechery. Syph. What would Hanniball? Scip. Is't Hanniball? We are betrai'd by Syphax. Han. What art? Scip. Romes Generall, and thy enemy. Han. Ha! Scipio! Then the character report Give's of him's false. He scornes ignoble wayes Of honour; to ore-come by trechery. Scip. I thought the same of Hanniball. Han. And findst it. Tis onely thy conspiracy with Syphax; Who makes his Court a priviledge for that Fame will proclaime with blushes. Syph. Why this uproare? Han. Syphax th'art trecherous. Scip. To Rome and Scipio. Han. To Hannibal and Carthage. Pist. Now observe How he will calme the tempest. Syph. What to answer From sudden doubts you both possesse me with, I cannot easily resolve. A jealousie Is sometimes strengthned by th'excuse should kill it. Yet if your confidence will give credit to A Kings religious oath, by all that makes The sacred difference in me I am free From thought of ill to either. Your arrivals Were unexpected; and if eithers danger Be smother'd in intent, you brought it with you: Which Ile prevent, if all Numidia's strength Can doe it. Thinke not me perfidious, For then Ile doubt you: since selfe evills are Most commonly the parents of suspicion. But for your owne mistrusts, y'are safer here Than in your owne campes, guarded with a maze Of your best souldiers. Han. 'Tis a satisfaction. I blesse th'occasion makes us meet: my longings Were violent to see thee Scipio. Scip. Mine more to see thee Hanniball; but rather Arm'd in the field, prepard for an encounter, Then here to parlee. Han. Doubt not such a greeting When next we meet. Syph. I needs must interpose, And moderate this contention. Pray my Lords Let me be powerfull to dispose your tempers For other mild impressions, that my Court For entertaining two such enemies At once, be made discourse for after-ages. A banquet waits yee: musick usher it. Musick. Thus peace bids Souldiers welcome. Scip. Syphax no. Thinke of Romes cause, and let your feast be season'd With faith to that. If thou prove trecherous, Expect a vengeance, justice never yet Gave severe execution to a greater. I must be gone; th'affaires of warre attend me When I have settled Romes peace, wee'l comply In the effects: action 'till then must live By blood and labour. Hanniball farewell: Next greeting will be rougher. Han. Not to be calm'd With words. Grow strong; be still a conquerour, Till I shall conquer thee. Scip. Thou art but flatter'd By an ambition vainer than thy dreames. Ten Carthages and Hannibals will not weigh Equall with the atchievment. Han. One Hanniball And Carthage poys'd but in an equall scale With twenty Romes, and twenty Scipios, Shall weigh like lead 'gainst feathers. Scip. Proud insister Vpon his owne slight merits! Remember Syphax Thy vow hath made thee Romes. Syph. Which Ile preserve As sacredly inviolate, as if Eternall seales had ratifi'd it. Vsher Flourish. Exeunt. The Romane Generall forth. Him. Have words such power Vpon our Generall to deject him thus? Han. My braine is labouring. Him. Ile helpe to deliver it. Han. As giddy fancies when they doe present Delightfull shaddowes, seeme to please the sense When it is quiet, and not capable Of any object, 'till the dreamers joy Suddenly wakes him, and the false impressions Vanish to their first nothing, so have I Flatter'd my hopes. Him. I prophesie successe Despight of Scipio. Syphax Counsailours (Whose secret correspondency with us Taught the great meanes by which their Masters love Must be regain'd) a long experience Confirmes our friends: then prosecute it throughly. Scene the fourth. To them Piston, Crates, and a little after Syphax. They are return'd. Pist. My Lord 'till now the accidents Caus'd by the Romanes presence did prevent us From giving satisfaction to your doubts, Which were but justly grounded. Our young King Is full of's youthfull passions, and so violent Ith' prosecution of them counsell rather Doth set a keener edge upon his appetite. We therefore give him way. But if we cannot Reduce his actions to a rule of judgement, Wee'l openly oppose him, or conspire As 'gainst a tyrant that makes will his law. See hee's return'd: be confident. Syph. How! whispering! I doe suspect. Han. If Syphax dare be private. Syph. Dare Hannibal! Hadst thou intents more black Than ever night gave execution to, Even in Carthage Senate house as well As in mine owne Court, I dare stand th'encounter Of single Hannibal. Withdraw. Han. They must not. The wrongs thou hast done Carthage must be witness'd: That when fame speakes them lowdest, partiall men Make not their incredulity an excuse For what no satisfaction can restore, Thy honour lost in infamy. Syph. Thou tempt'st me With these darke prefaces. Yet thy upbraydings Doe seeme so frivolous, my patience rather Laughs at their vainnesse. Cleare my understanding Without more circumstance, for yet my innocence Knowes not t'accuse my selfe, unlesse forgiving Thy sawcy taunts a priviledge. Han. What errour But to defend it selfe will strive (though vainly) To mock truth out of truth? Well Syphax knowes The expectation of a state deluded Cannot but trouble it. A King is more Than a meane person, bounded with dimensions Of the bare man. His actions are his peoples; And what he doth or suffers they must stand. Consider then when Carthage shall call up Revenge, and with all force pursue the injury To satisfaction; when her souldiers (Whom custome hath made pittilesse) shall plough The wombes of teeming Mothers with their fauchions, To prevent the issue that might vindicate A father slaine; make your Numidian Virgins The ruines of their pleasure, and not leave An altar to your gods, nor private Lar That may defend a houshould from their violence: When these (whose very repetition carry's Horrour enough to fright men into peace) Shall happen— Syph. When they shall! it rather seemes A positive threat. Tell Carthage were her power Of an extent that limits could not bound With any circumscription, I'de not feare it. To dye for Rome were above victory. Furnisht ten thousand choyce Numidian Horsemen To wait on Scipio. Why are our commands No more respected? Ile have execution Forerunne my Edicts that concerne the good Of Rome and Scipio. Stand yee like dull statues Fixt to their first foundations; when your diligence Should borrow speed from winds, as if yee rid On the contracted ayre to hasten it? Han. Full well their age wise with experience knows To disobey a Kings unjust commands Law and religion warrants. Syphax youth Were fitter to court beauty, than to sit At a states helme, and steere the various course It's subject to, by his greene violent passions. With which his bed e're this had beene enricht, Had Carthage found him kind: Faire Sophonisba. Crat. That name hath startled him. Han. She from whose eyes The amorous sunne, resigning first his owne; Might be ambitious to derive new fires. Yet she to be reserv'd for his embraces, Who slights that honour all the neighbouring Kings Have beene competitors for, and would lay downe Their Crownes to purchase; sell their very beings To be translated into a possession Of Sophonisba. Pist. It begins to worke. Syph. Whence did th'intent of this great honour to me Derive it selfe? Han. From a desire of friendship And league with Syphax: which his passionate love To Rome and Scipio (that admits no reason) Denying, I must publish the dishonour Done to a Lady, at whose least command A Nation shall be arm'd, led by such Captaines As in their emulation will declare What mortals owe to her divine perfections; That warrant her revenge as just a quarrell, As ever stir'd up valour in a conscience Scruples had cowarded. Here my commission Takes end, and I must goe. Syph. Stay Hanniball. Strange passions warre against my resolution; And love begins to circle me in flames E're my eye takes the fire. What's Rome or Scipio To Sophonisba? in whose richer beauty Mor's comprehended, then the Macedonian Could from his many conquests, and subversion Of Monarchies boast himselfe owner of. What's a King's promise but a politick (And that's allow'd) evasion to gaine time For counsaill with his will? Ile be for Carthage To enjoy Sophonisba. I'am enflam'd From the report, and if my senses find Truth answering fame, great Hannibal shall lead Numidias power 'gainst Rome, or any place He hath design'd for conquest. Han. But if Syphax Should againe suffer Scipio's menacies To fright his weaknesse out of this resolve! Syph. My weakenesse! tempt me not with a suspect. Let me have Sophonisba, or I'le make A rape upon your Carthage, not on her, For what delight's in violence? Enquire The cause of that lowd shout. Shout within, Messenger. Messen. I come t'informe you. A stately ship from her rich laden wombe, Hath on our shore deliver'd such a traine Of glorious Virgins that attend on one, Who lead's the rest— Han. No more; 'tis Sophonisba. Syph. Receive her with religious ceremony. Perfume the ayre with incence richer then The Phœnix funerall pile. Let harmony Musicke. Breath out her soule at every artists touch. Cover the pavement which her steps must hallow With Persian Tapestry. How I am ravish't With th'expectation? and like some light matter Catch't in a whirle-wind, all my faculties Are hurried forward. Scene the fifth. To them Sophonisba, Ladies all in white, and veil'd: who to the musicke of the song, place themselves in a figure for a daunce. Veil'd 'tis sure some mockery. The Song. Beautie no more the subject be Of wanton art to flatter thee: Or in dull figures call thee spring; Lillie or Rose, or other thing: All which beneath thee are, and grow Into contempt when thou dost show The unmatch't glory of thy brow. Chorus. Behold a spheare of Virgins move, None mongst them lesse then Queene of Love. And yet their Queene so farre excels Beauty and she are onely parallels. A daunce too! I'le expect th'event. In the daunce they discover themselves in order, Sophonisba last. A faire one: But 'tis not Sophonisba. Fairer yet. Vnhappy Syphax from whose eyes such wonders Have beene to long conceal'd. Which is the goddesse? Which Sophonisba? Sopho. Can thy sense distinguish? See Syphax, thus I deigne to shew thee that Kings have beene proud to worship. Syph. E're I embrace Let me admire. In each eye sit's a Cupid; Who as he skip's about to shoot his dartes. Is himselfe fetter'd in the golden curles That deck her brow. Elysium's but a fable, And that eternity the Poets dreame of Serv's but to figure this. Sopho. Although my difference Might challenge more, I'm not ambitious Of shallow praise. My spirit must flie high To catch at fame, not flattery. Syph. Came you not To love me then? Sopho. I did: but not to thinke All your expressions (though they were extended Beyond my wish) can merit it. Syph. I am A King; and you me thinks should court the fortune With a glad readinesse, to share my honours, And to be made my equall. Sopho. Were you more, I am above addition in my selfe: And should be lessen'd if I did confine A thought to any person, and the act Included nothing but bare satisfaction Of a desire. I will not let a smile Fall loosly from me, but shall be attended By actions worth their history; which read Shall with the apprehension of my greatnesse Amaze posterity. Syph. Can Sophonisba Be covetous of more then the earths honours? When she shall sit incompass'd in a ring Of noble Matrons that shall deifie Her beauty with their praises? When she shall Be crown'd with sparkling wreathes to blind the gazers, As if a Constellation had beene rob'd To make her shine. When in a Kings armes sleeping All pleasures shall be minister'd, that Nature And art in their contention strive to owne, And take their glory from. Sopho. Thei'r prety baites To catch an easie wanton, whose dull earth A little varnish't o're doth know it selfe No farther then the superficiall tincture Discoverd in her glasse. I have a soule Greater then Syphax Kingdome: and to bound it Would take from what I am. 'Twill be your honour 'Bove all that your ambition can direct you To hope for (next eternity) If I Vouchsafe to add unto your petty royalty My greater selfe; and the addition be Greater then you can purchase by your conquests. 'Tis but her due when Sophonisba crav's Worlds for her Kingdomes, their Kings for her slaves. Should Syphax make a resignation Of all he own's for me; 'twere but as if He par'd a mol-hill from the earth, to place An Atlas in its stead. Han. Come Sophonisba You must consent: ther's fame in't that will give you An everlasting being in the memory Of benefits your Country will derive from't. Children shall first be taught to speake your name; And from their aged grandsires learne your story. Whose often repetition shall take from The tediousnesse of age, and make them seeme As if they danc't for joy, when palfies shake them. Syph. Am I enflam'd, and shall I not enjoy? Mock me not Lady into a despaire. You shew me heaven, and shut the gates against me. Make not a King, that daign's to be your servant, A slave unto your cruelty. Han. To give Syphax a satisfaction, your competitor False Massanissa, he that shar's your Kingdome. And would ingrosse it all, hath long solicited For Sophonisbas love. Sopho. Oh Massanissa. Han. He having now forsaken Carthage, shee Out of her piety to doe her Country A good, preferr's you: and that her revenge May be pursu'd with greater violence, Allow's her elfe your right; though she's a treasure Might be dispos'd of to a more advantage Or Carthage strength. Syph. Will Sophonisba love then If I fight Carthag's quarrell? Sopho. Yes; your fortune Whilst 'tis at hight: but the least declination Waving it to an ebb, I from that fall Must mount to higher honours, if a gale Meete it to raise me. Syph. Massanissas person It seem's could limit your desires. Sopho. He was A man made up of fire; no grosse earth clog'd His spirit when 'twould mount to honours top, And load fame with his acts. Had he not falln From Carthage, Sophonisba had but beene The price of his desert. And yet I love him. Deere Massanissa! Syph. Shee hath overcome me. I will be great; every dayes action Shall raise me a step higher, and I'le take You with me Lady: no; you shall lead me The tribute I will pay for every kisse Shall be a victory o're your enemies. Proud Rome shall find Syphax can be a Souldier, When Sophonisba bid's him put on steele. Han. The not to be resisted power of beauty. Carthage I will salute thee now with joy. Nor shall the thought of thy ingratitude Make me lesse willing: to pursue thy good Through a deepe sea of vanquisht Romans blood. Syph. Wee'l feast, then fight. Who led by such bright eyes Would not march on to any enterprize? Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The third Act.] The argument of the third Act. Syphax warring against the Romans, at length is taken prisoner by Massanissa; who finding Sophonisba in the City of Cirtha, marry's her, with a vow not to deliver her up to the Romances. For which marriage being reprov'd by Scipio, he giv's her poyson; which shee tak's to prevent the Romanes triumph over her. The Scene Vtica. Scene the first. Scipio, Souldiers: a little after Lelius. Scip. Syphax so soone revolted I what weake man Would mock away his safetie? Chldren thus Playing with fire to please their foolish sense Are often burn't and make their sport the instrument Of their owne danger. Massanissa yet Is constant, and by this time hath subdu'd him. Successe must follow those attemps that rise From a just cause, and crowne the enterprise. Lelius what newes? Lellius. I labour with th'event; Ioy hinder's a delivery. Massanissa Guirt in a conquest, greater never made A triumph glorious, is returning back To present Scipio with Numidias spoyles, And Syphax captiv'd. Scip. 'Tis a joyfull errant. Iust Nemesis, thy Griffins have beene swift, And borne thee well to see the execution Of a revenge upon perfidious Syphax. Hadst thou fail'd in't, we justly might disclaime Thy deity, and without feare of punishment Prophane thy altars: on whose marbles now Wee'l pay a sacrifice of richest flame Mixt with the blood of Kings. Discourse the progresse To this event. Leli. When your successefull policy Had destroy'd both the Campes of Asdrubal. And Syphax with devouring fire, whose flames seem'd to the distant gazers on't a prodigie That threaten'd dissolution, and begot Their greater feare, then when th'Artilerie Of heaven speak's lowdest through the burning ayre To tell the world Iove's angry: When you retir'd To Vtica to prevent an invasion Intended by the Carthaginian Navy, Which dark't the Sea (much like a clowd of Vulturs That are convented after some great fight To glut their ravenous gorges with the gore, Thousands of soul-lesse men lye reeking in) The mad Numidian King, in whom despaire Had kindled a new valour, gather's head. And with a fresh supply of unman'd men (For had they beene such as experience Had taught the usefull order of a warre Th'end had againe beene doubtfull) giv's us battaile. Their first assault made us retire; yet still We kept the suddaine forme hast put us in For best advantage: 'till their heedlesse courage Hurri'd them on, where our foot Legions Observing their disorder (for they fought In throngs so thick, that many times one striking Wounded his fellow) giv's them new resistance. At which they stop, mated with apprehension Of their owne danger: whom th'incensed King Mixing his threates with promises of honour Labour's to bring on; till his horse being kill'd We tooke him prisoner, with two thousand more. The rest not slaine are fled. Scip. Brave victory Worthy th'atchievers, to whose memories Eternall statues shall be rais'd, and trophees Rich as Romes Capitoll is glorious with. But where is Massanissa? Leli. He pretended To visit Cirtha, Syphax chiefest Citie: Which is deliver'd up. Scip. I have new feares Flourish. That woman will agen bewitch him. Know The cause. Scene the Second. To them Massanissa, Souldiers bringing in Syphax bound. Leli. 'Tis Massanissa. Scip. Th'only wealth I'de be possest of. I embrace in thee A boundlesse treasure. Massa. Let not Scipm Flatter me into pride for what is rather Fortunes then mine. Scip. The actions of thy vertue. Fortun's an under power that is her selfe Commanded by desert. 'Tis a meere vainnesse Of our credulity to give her more Then her due attribute; which is but servant To an heroick spirit. Massa. This example Might instance proofes for her divinity. All's but endeavour untill perfected By the successe, and that is fortunes only; Desert shar's little in't. Scip. Let not thy modesty Maintaine such errors. To refuse just praise Is an extreme worse then man's over-weening Opinion of himselfe. Great Massanissa Shall have all honours due unto his conquest; And weare triumphant Garlands; that false King Chain'd to his Chariot from the gazers eyes Inviting scorne, not pitty. Syph. 'Tis not manly To insult over misery, to which Thy self's as subject, and perhaps mai'st feele, Chance mak's prosperity when 'tis at highest But pastime to delight her giddy humour: And will'd ject the most secure possessour, When she command's a restitution Of her lent favours, that she may conferre them Vpon another. This consideration Might invite mercy. Scip. When superiour justice Mak's us her instrument, should we be partiall I th'execution, 'twere to mock the power, And call downe vengeance. Yet I grieve for Syphax That he deserv's the punishment; whose weaknesse Suffer'd a peece of painted earth to tempt him From his religion, and neglect the gods, Whom he invok't for witnesse to that vow A woman made him violate. Syph. 'Tis my hope Shee may deceive thee too, and with her charmes Bewitch the boasting Conquerour that's her slave. From's faith to Rome. Massa. His madnesse will betray me To a reproach Syph. It tak's from mine owne suffering To see mine enemy in the same danger: When he by his adulterous embraces Receiv's the like infection int' his soule That made me sick of vertue, and of all But my disease. Scip. Doe you enjoy the Lady? Massa. Yes: she's my wife. Scip. Your act was somewhat rash; Before her husbands death! Doth the religion You pay Numidia's gods warrant it lawfull? Massa. Syphax is dead in his captivity. His life was mine; which I but lent him only For Romes great triumph. Scip. Wee'l consult a little, And then dispose you Syphax. Syph. As your will Adviseth you. It is the curse of greatnesse To be it's owne destruction. So we see That mountaine Cedars have the least defence Gainst stormes, when shrubs confront their violence. Exeunt. Scene the third. Scipio, Massanissa remaining. Scip. When first you freely did commit your selfe Vnto my charge, and promis'd with a vow My liking only should dispose your actions, Either you lov'd them, or your flattery Pretended admiration of some vertues You thought possest me. One I must confesse I glory to be master of, that's continence. I have converst with beauties rich as Nature Did ever make art proud to counterfeit; Might have commanded some that conquest gave me: Yet have I still kept out desire, but you Have yeelded to that passion doth betray A weakenesse in you, will obscure the glory Of all your other goodnesse. Thinke how dangerous 'Tis to a young man (on whose expectation Opinions eye is fix't) to mixe his actions With wanton pleasures, when his thoughts transferre The wicked objects of his humorous sense Vnto his soule, that poison all her faculties, And make them uselesse. Noble Massanissa, Your good deeds sung by fame are musicke to me: Your errours I had rather you your selfe Would silently consider, and reforme, Before with any shew of least unkindnesse You force me to reprove them. Massa. Let not Scipio Deny those errors an excuse. If nature Had a like cloth'd mens dispositions, And all did weare one habit of the mind, You need not urge th'example of your owne T'instruct anothers continence: for all From a necessited and innate temperance. Would be as you are. Though I doe not boast Command o're pleasures, I pursue them not With an intemperate appetite, but make Reason my guide, that tell's me to provide For a succession, doth become the judgement Of a wise King. Posterity may well Be call'd th'eternity of life: he never Dy's that hath issue; for which I have marryed Her mine owne conquest gave me. Scip. Your owne conquest! Pray doe not arrogate too much: you must not Dispose Romes prisoners whilst you fight her quarrell. The warr's not yours, though yours the victory. She must attend her sentence from our Senate; Which hardly will be partiall to her beauty, Though 'twere adulterated with more art, Then e're lasciviousnesse was mistresse of, And rack't invention for. Let Sophonisba Be then deliver'd up. Massa. Perhaps your selfe After your boasted continence would have her To be your owne. Scip. Is that your jealousie? Weake passionate man, that through thy blinded reason Foresee'st not thine owne danger by th'example Of others misery, and yet art ripe, To maintaine grossest errours of thy will, And seeme discretions master. Had not Syphax (Bewitch by magick of her wanton eye Into a dotage) broke his faith with Rome, He might have flourish'd in his height of glory; And still commanded over his Division. Which Rome will add to Massanissas Kingdome Yeelding up Sophonisba. Massa. You would seeme To give me mines, upon condition I should restore the gold, reserving only The earth to trample on. In Sophonisba I have a treasure mine owne life shall ransome, If she be forc't away; and to consent She should be yeelded up to any Romane Were worse then sacriledge, though I should teare The hallowed statues of Numidias gods Downe from their altars, and convert their Temples Into the loathsom'st uses of necessity. Kings oathes are equall with decrees of Fate, Those I have made I cannot violate. Scip. Then I disclaime thee. Ther's not so much danger In a knowne foe, as a suspected friend. To prevent an incendium it is best To quench a brand before it fire the rest. Exit. Massa. He's angry, and I must not let it grow To ripenesse of his hate. I am resolv'd To be th'example of a constancy Fame shall proclaime for wonder. Scene the fourth. To him Sophonisba. She's already Come e're my wish could summon her. Her sight Begins to shake the weake foundation Of my resolves. Like stones shot from an engine She ruin's with the battery of her eye What my intents had built. Soph. Why is my Lord Thus clowdy? I expected entertainment Of other difference; such as cheerefull love Present's desire with from the enterchange Of smiles and amorous glaunces. Massa. Sophonisba! I was new enter'd into meditations Of death, and other wretchednesse, depend's Vpon mortality. Soph. Is that the argument Of your dejectednesse? it shew's too much Of womans weakenesse. Man should have a spirit Above the feare any consideration Can worke within him. Death is but an entrance To our eternity: and if our life Merit a blessednesse hereafter, we Should runne with joy to meete it. Massa. But if one Possest of happinesse beyond the hope Of any greater; that denies another Can be in expectation (more then what His soule enjoy's already) apprehended A separation from it by the malice Of death, or other accident, 'twould force him Weep silently within, though shame restrain'd His outward teares. Sopho. This circumstance would seeme To prepare something that should have relation Vnto your selfe or me. Perhaps the Consull Hath urg'd that I should be deliver'd up To Romes disposing. Massanissas vow Made with religious ceremony cannot If he respect the gods consent to it. And rather then their tyranny should make me Wretched a new, to my first earth returne me, The worst remaines of Sophonisba. Massa. Dare shee Dye then to quit her feares? Sopho. And meete the instrument With greater cherefulnesse, then fondest parents Can shew at the returne of their deere child From long captivity. This tender frame Lodgeth a masculine and heroick spirit. And if thy passionate love deny's thy selfe To be the Actor in this benefit, Give me thy sword; my owne right hand shall guide The point unto my heart: I'le without trembling Open a passage for the crimson drops; And smile to see them diaper the pavement, As if 'twere some conceited workemanship Made by the lookers fancie. Massa. E're mine eyes Should suffer such an object to offend Their hitherto pleas'd sense, I would dissolve them In their owne humour. No Sophonisba; This breath shall first wast into empty ayre, And leave my naked bones i'th' hallow'd pile E're I prove false to thee. Give me some wine: I'le drinke a bridall health to Sophonisba, And mixe it with Nepenthe. Here's the juice Will cause forgetfulnesse, and mock th'extremity Of any adverse fortune. Messenger with wine. Sopho. Sure 'tis poyson. Will Massanissa leave me then unguarded To Scipios violence? I have here no father Nor uncle to defend me; not so much As a poore teare by weeping to stirre up A Romanes pity: I shall only dart An anger from my burning eye, to shew The Carthaginian spirit I was borne with, Which notwithstanding will not quit this part From a captivity: this Scipios rage Will hurry in his triumph to be gaz'd at, And scorn'd by the course rabble. Doe not then By such a keeping of it breake thy vow; For 'tis no lesse to me. I must still want The benefice of such a constancy. For though himselfe live not to yeeld me up I am expos'd to't, and without least power To make resistance. Let me then partake That meanes of best security Massa. Not to have A Monument of lasting Adamant Rais'd to my memory. No Sophonisba This is no potion to preserve a beauty In it's first greene; or ripe it to a Summer; Or prevent th'Autumne; or returne the Winter Into a new Spring. This will pale the dye Which thy check blusheth when it would cloth modesty In a rich scarlet: make that Ivorie brest (Now Loves soft bed whereon he play's the wanton, And ambusheth himselfe to catch the flames He shoot's at others from thy eyes) as cold As Scythian sands, bleak't with continuall freezing Into a seeming christall. Scipio dar's not Insult o're thee: thy face would check his malice Into a silent admiration of it. Or if he sin so much as to deject thee With the least feare of ill, the gods themselves Will leave their immortality to be Each others rivals in thy love, and strive Which should revenge thee best. This must not weaken What is so powerfull. Sopho. If my Lord be then Resolv'd to leave me widdow'd, being yet Scarce warme in his embraces, let me mixe A teare with his last drink, that he may carry Something of Sophonisba with him. Massa. That Hath in't sufficient vertue to convert All the Thessalian, Pontick, Phasian aconites Into preservatives, and turne this draught Into an antidote: which yet is powerfull, 'Bove all that Art and Nature in conspiracy Of mischiefe e're invented. We that are Great, and yet subject to th'incertainty Of Fortune, have this custome to prevent it. We affect glory: and conclude no state, That end's not in it selfe, is fortunate. So— Offers to drinke Soph. Let my Lord first give me leave to breath An errant o're it; that when he is entred Elysium, throngs of Carthaginian Heroes May bid him welcome, and informe themselves From him of Sophonisba. Massa. Do't then quickly. I'le beare it, and command the King of night Resigne his ravish't Queene to be thy hand-maid. Hell, I shall now be armed to meete thy horrour: With greater power then thine. Soph. If there be Fate, Why is't conceal'd? The revelation of't Would make us strive to mock eternall providence: Th'ingenious Artist that did forme this cup Foresaw not such a use of't. Had he knowne It should have minister'd death to a King, His trembling hands could ne're have finish't it With such exactnesse. What so e're decree Is written in the Adamantine Tables Of Destiny, we must subscribe to. Time Though he keepe on his swift and silent pace, Death's sure at first or last to win the race. Pray keepe out Scipio: I have almost ended. So— Drink's. Massa. Ha! what hath Sophonisbas madnesse done? Oh Æsculapius if thy deity Be not a feign'd one, then administer, And shew it powerfull in restoring back My Sophonisba to her former safety. Numidia shall pay worship to none other But thee and Phœbus. Altars shall be rais'd Made of Iberian gold, and flame with incense, Vntill Arabia's richest earth grow's barren Of gummes and spices. Sopho. Why doth Massanissa Invoke vaine aide? The gods are mercifull In their denying it: and 'tis but justice That I should dye; m'adulterous easinesse Deserv'd it, that without the least resistance Left my yet living husband to embrace His enemy. But it had warrant from The end, my Countries good, and the first love I bare thee Massanissa. Now let Scipio Boast of his conquest; Sophonisba is Her owne subverter. It begin's to worke With a full strength: my blood would serve to heate A Salamander, and convert his ice Into a flame. Ætna's but painted fire To that which burn's my marrow. Yet my lookes Are cherefull and erected. Victory Was never met more joyfully, then I Embrace that death prevents my misery. My weake earth totters underneath a weight That sink's it downewards: my still living spirit Rid's upon clowds to reach Ioves highest skie. Who feare not death, but in the worst part dye. Dy's. Mass. She's dead. Sincke ye supporters of this fabrick Into your deep foundations; make them graves For your owne ruines, since there is not left A weight worthy your bearing. Shee's not dead: Only she hath translated her divinity To it's owne blest abodes, and call's on me To pay a mortals duty. Shallt have sacrifice, And rich too. Kings out of devotion shall Offer themselves in flames, and from their ashes Rise glorious stars; whence learned curiosity Deriving a new art, shall teach Astrologers The vertues of an influence shall include Secrets to make credulity astonish't At their presages. I will be their president; And make this earth, already consecrated With Sophonisba's pretious feete, an altar. Open thy crannies to receive my blood, And from it's mixture spring a grove of Balsame. Led by whose ravishing odour the new issue Of every Phœnix shall neglect Paxehaia, To bring her mothers spicy death bed hither, That's likewise her owne cradle. But this action Should have more state, and ceremony. No. A King's the Priest; a King's the Sacrifice; His owne sword whilst 'tis yet warme with his victory Shall serve for th'axe, and so—Shall I but dye then? I'le live to pay her more then th'expiration Of a short breath, and dye to all delights, But what I can derive from her faire memory: Which shall be treasur'd here; and by it's virtue Revive to kill me; every life it giv's Causing another death. Scene the fifth. To him Scipio, Lelius, Souldiers. Scip. The Lady dead! Massa. To Scipios malice. Scip. Could not Massanissa Acquit himselfe of one, but by committing A greater folly! But I must not chide. Most worthy Massanissa! Massa. Keep your flattery. I have no Sophonisba. Touch her not: None but my selfe shall beare her to the pile. The sacrilegious hand besides attempt's it I will cut off. Your triumph shall not twice Kill Sophonisba. Exit with the body. Scip. With best care attend him Vnto our Tent; least that his passion grow Into a desperate frenzie, I must cure it By counsell mixt with gifts. In that weake woman Halfe Carthage strength is gone. Leli. Our Spyes informe That th'other halfe (which I conceive is Hannibal) Intend's upon th'event of one great battell To hazard all. His Camp's already pitch't Neere Zama: whence a messenger is sent That show's the Carthaginian much desir's To have some conference with you. Scip. Wee'l dispose Our Army thitherward. Me thinks I see Victory crown'd already clap her wings Over our heads. What a strange circulation Is in times accidents? From victory Peace is deriv'd; from peace security; Thence lust; ambition: two maine grounds of jarres: We fight for peace, and peace agen breed's warres. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The fourt Act.] The argument of the fourth Act. Hannibal being wholly overcome by Scipio at the battle of Zama, return's to Carthage: where being ill entertain'd by the Senate, he behav's himselfe roughly in the Senate-house; and their intention of delivering him up to Scipio being discover'd, by the ayde of his Faction, he escap's and flies. The Carthaginians submitting themselves are reprov'd by Scipio; who likewise imposeth upon them the strictest conditions, and by an example of his owne, reclaim's Massanissa from his passion. The Scene Carthage. Scene the first. Hanno, Gisgon, Bostar, a full Senate. Being sate, To them Nuntius. Hanno. Pray' take no notice that we know th'event Of the late battaile. I already have Employ'd my Faction 'bout a peace, and Scipio Is not farre off. It shall not be the act Of Hannibal to boast of. When we have Betray'd him to the Romanes, the conditions Besides are easie. Gisg. Mind the publick Bostar: D'you thinke it not concern's you? Bost. 'Twas my riches Made me a Senatour: my wisedome never Deserv'd the purple. Be you politick; Let me preserve my state. Gisg. Your wealth! 'tis granted Rais'd you to this high place. Necessity May corrupt justice in a Magistrate: Which to prevent, at least our jealousies, Our Carthaginian custome in election Of Senatours, sometimes preferr's the rich Before the best men. Take your seate. Bost. To fill it: Feare will not let me sleep. Hanno. Attend the Message: It seem's from Hannibal. Bost. A worthy man. He sent us home three bushels full of rings, Of which I shar'd the most. Nunt. Before I speake, Me thinks the ayre about me as the sound Of my sad words doth passe through it, should thicken Into a clowd; then melt at every periode Into a weeping raine, till none be left To give us breath for sighes. Our Hannibal Is vanquish't by the Romanes. Bost. We shall then Have no more wealth brought home, nor safely keepe What we possesse already. Curse on chance That mock's us thus. I'le never make her statue Of gold hereafter, and by consequent Ne're worship her: I have but cold devotion Towards a wooden goddesse. Hanno. 'Tis not fit Evils remedilesse should be lamented. From a misfortune something may arise To prevent greater, if it be apply'd With an exact consideration Of all occurents that may make it usefull, Relate it then. Nun. Before the battaile joyn'd The worlds two Captaines (for besides them none Merit's the name in equall competition) Mett to have conference: where for a space They stood astonish't at each others presence: And like two Comets tilting in the ayre 'Gainst one another, shot prodigious flames From eithers eyes; and with a counterchange Of fierce and angry lookes seem'd to begin An eagre fight: 'till Hannibal broke silence, And mov'd a peace: Which Scipio (or suspecting it To be but wonted policy, or confident Both of his owne strength and successe) refus'd. Then like two clowds swoln big with a nights tempest, And hurryed forward by contrary winds, Iusling each other, 'till their ribbes being broken The sulphurous issue flie's through the black ayre; An inundation following that would fright Natures Archeus from his quiet center; To seeke an Ætna or Vesævus out Where he might drie himselfe: so met the Armies. And with a shout, that our-noys'd thunder, charg'd Each other bravely; at their first encounter Mixing their bloods in streames, that every way Flow'd like a tide. As yet the peacefull goddesse Inclin'd to neither part, 'till Massanissa Brought up his right wing of Numidian horsemen, And broke th'array; enforcing our first battle Back to our second; when we were compel'd To fight against our owne, least their retiring Might put us out of order; 'till betwixt us Dead bodies made a Bulwarke; so that neither We nor the Romanes but by trampling on Our fellowes carcasses could strike a blow Of any use. The Romane Legions now O're-prest us with their number, and both wings Or horsemen wheel'd about t'assault our reere. We then were compast; yet like angry Lyons Whom the toyle hamper's, labour'd for our freedome; But few escap't: five hundred only live Of forty thousand, which to Adrumentum Are fled with Hannibal: whence he intend's To visit Carthage suddainely. Hanno. His welcome If he fore-knew't would give him small encouragement. Th'incertainty of warre! Did Hannibal Solicite peace? I'le seeme t'oppose it then, Though it intend a good. The inborne malice Betwixt our families will not permit me Allow his acts or counsell. By his greatnesse Mine is eclips'd: and though this overthrow May make him lesse in popular opinion, His Faction yet is strong. Gisg. What meane you Bostar! Bost. I'm dead; that horrible relation kill'd me In 'ere shall see addition to my heape, Now Hannibal is conquer'd. Hanno. You have stor'd Enough wealth to maintaine another Army That may bring home increase. Pray let us use Your state, wee'l spare your wisedome. Bost. How's that Hanno! My state, and spare my wisedome. I'm a Senatour, And weare my gowne as formally as you: Can nodde and spet at th'end of every sentence, And number with my owne Arithmetick More somes of coyne then thy whole family. Part with my wealth! I'le rather dye, and purchase Hell with't, if Pluto would but sell his Kingdome. Yet sure it cannot be so rich as I am. The judges there are just; bribes cannot buy A partiall sentence. Scene the Second. To them Hannibal, some Souldiers. Han. Ha! me thinks they should Salute me, though I bring not victory. When I presented them with wealth, their flatteries Were greater then became them. Am I lesse In merit now, then when successe attended My actions! glew'd unto their seates, and Hannibal Enter'd. Grave fathers. Hanno. On sir: we are patient To heare you speake. Han. But patient! he that stand's Accus'd may challenge that, or justly taxe yee Of more then tyranny. Hanno. Are you so confident You dare affront your Iudges? Han. Ha! my Iudges. What envy though 'twere still'd from the black galls Of leane Erinnis Adders, can so blemish My life or fame, that from the least suspect I might incurre a sentence! Wa'st for this I have through blood and sweat made Carthage great As Rome her selfe; and had not politick dotage Infected with your private avarice (That would not spare me what my selfe bestow'd Vpon your ease) prevented it by calling Me and my Army home, I had e're this Made Rome your tributary; and am I Return'd now to be judge, because I have After so many victories lost one battle! The monstrous birth of your ingratitude Were able to fright manhood from posterity, And check all undertakings. Hanno. Whence did you Receive commission to move peace with Scipio? Han. From mine owne judgement that foresaw the danger My power could not prevent. Hanno. It seem's you were Declin'd to coward. Han. Ther's no priviledge Pulls him downe. Vnder your gowne for that. Learne to know man; Then be his judge. Bost. Pray heaven he hurt not me. Most valiant Hanniball. Han. I hate your flattery, Tis mixt with scorne; and I will rather trample Vpon your purple. Nunt. Good my Lord forbeare Your violence. Consider but their persons And dignities. Han. Should Jove himselfe provoke me With a disgrace like this, I'de challenge him To meet upon a cloud ram'd full of thunder: And dart it at him, 'till with flames I had Consum'd the brasse supporters of his heaven; Tumbling him downe with all his petty gods Vnto their first mortality. Nunt. The custome Of Carthage government commands respect Vnto their difference. Han. Let the respect Be likewise taught them that belongs to me. And if my labour hath maintain'd their ease, In which they have both studied and establish't Civill formalities, my rugged life Did never practise, it may well excuse A greater errour. Who is my accuser? Hanno. Your selfe. Han. My selfe! my selfe will be my judge then: And make th'abus'd feate honour'd for a justice, Which your corrupted soules would never suffer Your power to execute. Looke Carthaginians; And if your reasons eyes can see the errours Your blinded envie led it to, with blushes Guide them to reformation. I that tooke An oath at nine yeares old before the Altar, When it was smoking with the horrid sacrifice Of immolated men, to be Romes enemy, And perfect what my Father had begun; I that transferr'd the wealth of Spaine to Carthage, And thorow the frozen Alpes melted my way Into the fertile plaines of Italy; That waded with my army thorow the fennes Of gloomy Arnus, in whose fogges I lost One of my bodies comfortable lights; I that o'rethrew sixe Consuls, and at Cannas In one fight kill'd a hundred Romane Senators, And thence presented Carthage with a prey That might out-vye an Indian treasury Cram'd with the choycest wealth; I that abroad Whilst here you bath'd in pleasures made my body Proofe 'gainst a tempest, and endur'd the rage Of more prodigious stormes then ever frighted Mortals into religion. Hanno. Yet at Capua The faire Salapian Omphale could teach Our Carthaginian Hercules to spin, And mind his distaffe; else she would not smile Vpon him for his worke. Han. Thy malice Hanno Like to the broken some a rock beats back Vpon the angry maine, fowl's thine owne bosome. I am above it; and in spight of thee Or all the battery of thy calumnies, Will stand like a Colossus to be gaz'd at By all beneath me, when the scorne of men Shall lash thy envie with the whips of Satyres: Who vainely dost attempt to ruine that Is built for fame. Hanno. Nay you may keepe your seate, It well becomes you. Han. It becomes you better, When your grave nod and formall hem strik's terrour Through the affrighted malefactors heart; Who for some slight offence expects his judgement, No lesse than banishment, or confiscation Of all his substance; which is shar'd amongst you, The publike use neglected. But in vaine I taxe your vices, when your soules are sullyed With an ingratitude to me, that makes All others white as innocence compar'd With that black monster. Carthage I disclaime thee, And rather then imploy my power agen To raise thy head 'bove others, in thy ruines Ile hide mine owne. And but for reverence I beare the ashes of mine ancestors, I would my selfe plough furrowes in thy wombe, And sow my faction onely for th'increase Of mine owne greatnesse. Hanno. Pray observe it Fathers. He doth affect the Monarchie; he would Alter our government. Han. You are deceiv'd. Y'are weake enough already; there's no need Of a sedition to subvert your state. Can yee resist the Romanes, and make peace Vpon your owne conditions? Scene the third. To them Himulco hastily. What's the meaning? Him. You are betray'd my Lord; your safety needs A sudden resolution. Scipio's enter'd The Gates of Carthage. Han. Oh inhumane trechery! But for preventing justice that will fall Heavie upon you by some other instrument, 'Twere piety to wash corruption From this abus'd place with your bloods; whose staines Would yet infect the pavement, and remaine Like blushes in the marble to betray The guilt yee dy'd for. When the Romanes practise Their tyranny upon you, wish in vaine Yee had an Hannibal. Him. Your danger will not Allow your passion vent. Pray 'fligh my Lord. Han. Into some desart to converse with beasts; Th'have gratefull soules. Carthage me thinkes an earthquake Should palsey thy old joynts, &amp; shrink thy head Into thy shoulders: or thy Genius wrap thee In a perpetuall cloud to hide the shame Of this base act. Revenge, Ile court thee through The ruine of mine owne. Carthage shall see Not mine from her, her greatnesse grew from me. All those that love me follow. Exeunt, Senators remayning. Hanno. Would we had Ensnar'd him better: but his faction wanting A head, 'tis strengthlesse. Let a cryer publish The sentence of his banishment, that Scipio May take it for our act. We must comply With all occasions that may make our peace A usefull good, no voluntary bondage. We must receive the Romanes with a shew Of lesse feare, then the straites of our necessity Might excuse manhood for. Scene the fourth. To them Scipio, Massanissa, Lelius, some Souldiers. Scip. Now Carthaginians, Although I am a conquerour, successe Swells me no higher to preferre my selfe Above what judgement warrants. I have strove With all opposing reasons to forget Your often breach of faith: which you are tax't with By all men for a vice that th'ayre you breath Infects you with, as if the places nature Enforc't it from necessity. But custome Must be concluded, is the most efficient To cause that barbarous neglect of piety, Which should be mans sole object. I am strengthned Sufficiently 'gainst feare; since I can easily Compell you to subjection. But preferring A mild command before imperious rigour, Declare your selves, and you shall finde that we Practise no cruelty. Hanno. Most worthy Romane We might excuse the generall, and conferre The guilt upon some private few, who led By an ambition made this warre without Consent from us. Some we have justly punisht; And him, by whom (as by the first great mover) The rest were hurried forward, we have banisht, To take from Rome all cause of after-jealousie. His faction did prevent it, else we had Yeelded him up to Scipio. Peace is now The thing we crave, and the conditions No stricter then the Carthaginians Would have propos'd, had they beene conquerours, And Scipio su'd to them. Scip. Can there be faith In those that would betray their owne! and such a one As made the end of all his actions Your greatnesse first, and when that fail'd your safety? A man that more than figur'd Mars, and merited A deifying by your gratitude. Blush at it fame, and with thy hundred tongues Till all are hoarse proclaime it. The conditions Propos'd shall stand, if but to punish this, This monstrous act. Nature me thinks should throw yee From her warme bosome with an angry motion Of all th'earths sinewes, and not suffer yee To suck her milke; but dry her fruitfull wombe Into a barrennesse, before such monsters Should be againe produc't. As you performe The strictest clause, and what afflicts yee most, Call it not satisfaction for our injuries, But punishment for your ingratitude To Hannibal. Hanno. That will take from my suffering. When those we hate in misery beare a part, Envie growes fat by eating her owne heart. Exeunt. Scip. Lelius attend the Carthaginian Senators; Survey the City, and see execution Exit. Of all the league includ's. Doth Scipio triumph, And Massanissa hang the head! One article Is that they shall restore to Massanissa All that they have depriv'd him of. Massa. They cannot Restore my Sophonisba. Scip. Still that passion! I thought her memory had beene wash't away With the large streames of blood so lately flow'd From his victorious sword. Come Massanissa You shall enjoy a Romane Lady; one That shall out-vye the glory of a sunne Thron'd in his cleerest skie, and make his light Appeare but as a shadow to her beauty, One that shall comprehend within her selfe All that was ever faign'd of other women, And make their fables probable. Massa. Rome hath not Another Sophonisba. Scip. That the wealth Of Romes best province might but ransome home His lost command o're passions. Scene the fift. To them Lelius, Lucius, a young Lady. Who's this Lady? Leli. A Spanish captive. Scip. Did ever innocence Looke sweeter, as if she were joy'd to make This little frame her mansion. Why d'ee weepe? They shall not hurt you pretty one. Lad. They say They'l carry me to Rome. Scip. Suppose they doe; Romanes are full of gentlenesse, and mildly Will entertaine you; where you shall be taught Civility of manners. Education Clothing your minde in ornaments of vertue Fitting your expectation, and your beauty Rip't with mature age, Romane Knights shall court it. Perhaps my selfe would take you to my bed. Lad. Indeed you should not. You are a rough souldier; Your lookes would fright me. Scip. Can you then deny To cherish such a hope? You should enjoy Delights above your wish. Your house should be A court of pleasure. Spring should alwaies dwell Within your gardens, as if Tempe were Translated thither. Virgins should attend you Faire as the morning, when she ushers in The day with blushes. Your bathes should be the dew Gather'd from Roses, and your garments soft As the curl'd ayre, by mild Etesian windes Made temperate, when the Sunne rides on his Lion To hunt heavens Dog up. You should sleepe on downe Driven from Swannes white necks; be visited By Matrons; usher'd to solemnities; And at the publike showes out-shine the glory Of daylight with the lustre of those jemmes You should be deckt in; and a conquerour when His head's wrapt in triumphant Lawrell, couch it Vpon your lap. Massa. He's taken. Mans weake judgement, That calls it vice in others, which himselfe Is equally inclin'd to. Lad. I nere heard Of such fine things before. Scip. The barren soyle That bred you is in fault. I must confesse Nature hath in your yet imperfect beauty Shew'd wonders to the world: you are th'epitome Of her most curious labours; and if fortune Should in so faire a booke blurre any lest Exact drawne line, her deity were cruell. Your owne's a barbarous country, where civility Hath scarce a name. You cannot there expect A value of your selfe, above the worship Their eyes will give you, when they rudely gaze Vpon your forme, and by the sense distinguish The outward workmanship. We teach our soules A glorious conversation with those vertues That deck the inside of a beauteous frame, And vary pleasures, honours, earths delights To th'imitation of that infinite And never dying part. Lad. You Lucius Did never court me thus. You'd onely tell me That I should be a Queene, when your old Father Went to the lower Kingdome. Scip. What is Lucius? Luci. A Prince amongst the Celtiberians, This Lady Nobly borne to me betroth'd, If Scipio will be mercifull, I'de ransome. Scip. You love her then? Luci. Above my selfe: without her My being is not perfect. Scip. Blest occasion. Now Massanissa if example may Rectifie errors in thee, make my act An imitable president. Young Prince Receive her from my hands; withall the summe Intended for her ransome as a dowry. Love Rome and Scipio. Luci. Noblenesse above The reach of praise. How shall I shew my gratitude? Lad. When he hath made me Queen, Ile bid you welcome To Lucius Court. Luci. And Lucius when growne man Will bring you Souldiers. Massa. Seem'd he not to love her? And yet without least pause he gave her back Being possest. I am o'recome; I see Passion's the noble soules worst enemy I'm all for action. Musick. Scip. Massanissa is Become himselfe agen. Wherefore this musick? Leli. To gratulate your victory, and the peace That gives them rest, the Souldiers have prepar'd A slight solemnity: the Carthaginians Mixe with the Romanes, though their heavie hearts To part with so much treasure scarce admits it. Scip. 'Tis seasonable: there is cause to joy, Since Massanissa's new wed to my bosome, And this young Ladies nuptials. The Souldiers led in by their Captaines, distinguisht severally by their Armes and Ensignes, to the Musick of the following, put themselves into a figure like a battalia. The Song. On bravely, on; the foe is met; The Souldiers ranck't, the battaile sit. Make the earth tremble, and the skies Redouble ecchoes from your cryes. Bloud puts a scarlet mantle on The late greene plaine: they'l flie anon. Chorus. Then follow; but your orders keepe; Take prisoners; set their ransomes deepe. Retreat. For fame and the delight That peace brings onely Souldiers fight. The dance expressing a fight. Thankes to all. So you proportion pleasures, we give way to't. Is Lelius yet inform'd of Hannibal? Leli. That he is fled unto Antiochus, Or else to Prusias of Bythinia, His ends are doubtfull. Scip. If his discontent Should anew whet his envie to attempt Their aydes, 'twould much disturb the Asian provinces. Wee'l follow to prevent it. Lelius you Shall carry our successe unto the Senate, And with it Syphax, and the Carthage pledges. Come my soules halfe, wee'l hunt this Affrick Lion Into a stronger toyle. Fame shall waite on us Till we have loaded her, and that shee see Our triumph finisht in his tragedy. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The last Act.] The argument of the last Act. Hannibal being fled to Prusias King of Bythinia, receives his promise for his safety. The Romane Legates being arrived, and Hannibal perceiving Scipio and Flaminius (the Sonne of Flaminius whom hee had formerly slaine) to be amongst them, and understanding the house to be encompassed by armed men, suspecting himselfe to be betray'd, takes poison, (which he alwayes carryed about him carryed about him in his ring) Of which he dyes; and Scipio to prevent the like ingratitude from his Romanes, and out of a naturall addiction he alwayes had to learning (it being said of him, that Pædiam Cyri de manu non ponebat; and non nunquam incepto prælio cum philosophis disputabat) retires himselfe to his Country Villa; taking upon him as it were a voluntary banishment. The Scene Bythinia. Scene the first. Prusias, Hanniball, Himulco, Attendants.] Prus. Y're welcome, though your fortun's ebb'd. The memory Of what you have bin should c?mand respect From good men to you. Vertue is not lessen'd By want of a successe; that's but a glosse Fortune sets on her: Misery doth make Her inside glorious sometimes, when desertlesse, And bastard actions as the heires of chance Shine in their superficies: but being searcht Are found like bladders, swolne with an enforcement Of wind into them: which the least necessity Or adverse fortune pricking, they dilate Th'included ayre, and shrinke into their first Narrow dimensions: When true vertue beares Her owners head above afflictions waves, And steeres him into harbour. Han. You are noble, And like a King with judgement value me. My mind was ne're subjected: I have knowne So much of both, that neither of the pastimes Fortune delights her selfe with, can incline me To height above a moderate, nor decline me Below my selfe. Prosperity, adversity; Both make one even scale, and weight being added To either, shews the difference. Hee's not man Will be dejected or exalted. Every one Should temper the condition of his state, Such as the present makes it, with the feare Or hope of after change: and when hee labour's In the extremity of one, or flowes I'th swelling height of th'other, still his mind Should be the same. Chance varies every way; But vertues course is constant. Prus. You expresse A noble resolution, and your soule Shows rich and glorious even through the clouds Of your misfortune. There's a readinesse, And a propense desire in me to ayde you. But circumstance must make it probable Whether the causes justnesse may command Th'attendance of successe. For an attempt That's warranted by justice, cannot want A prosperous end. Han. If to defend my Country, Or to compell encroaching enemies To satisfaction, such as would deprive us Of th'earth that nature in her legacy Made our proportion be a justice, I Did never injury; for these were onely The motives to my actions. Fame I know Could not be silent, but shee must informe Even the remotest dwellers, how proud Rome (Whose infant greatnesse by ambition nurst Is now in growing, and will spread it selfe If a prevention stay it not, beyond All limits of the yet knowne world) insults Over her neighbouring Provinces. From Carthage She hath enforc't Sicilia (the worlds granary) And other Ilands: and her Generall Swolne with his fortune, hath attempted farther To overflow all Affrick. You may likewise Expect he will encroach upon your Asia; Antiochus being already vanquisht, And fled to Ephesus. If nothing else, Your safety should invite you to take armes, Though but defensive. States that never knew A change but in their growth, which a long peace Hath brought unto perfection, are like steele; Which being neglected will consume it selfe With its owne rust. So doth security Eate through the hearts of states whilst they are sleeping And lull'd in her false quiet. Prusias therefore Should dwell no longer in so great a danger. If hee'l not be a Souldier, let him arme His people; Hannibal will be their Captaine, And lead them unto actions that shall take Fame with the wonder, 'till I have made Rome (Who like th'earths issue heapes up hills on hills, To raise her proud head) nothing. My right hand Jove-like is arm'd with thunder, which shall fligh Wing'd with prodigious flames of just revenge To punish her impiety. Prus. I could gladly Cherish your resolutions, being grounded On justice: but t'engage my selfe or people In an uncertaine warre, before provok't By enemies, were rashnesse that excuse Could no way glosse to make it show an act Worthy a man, much lesse a King. Han. You value Those scruples more than a full weight of honour. Heaven gave the difference to you but to be The figure of that power, that will exact A just account of a Kings greater actions, Then what inferiours owe to their creation. Th'essentiall part of your eternity Depends upon that point: and can you more Expresse your selfe heavens minister, then when You doe the things agree with't? Prus. Rome comply's With us for peace. The violation Of a religious oath, superiour justice Cannot but punish: else we might be bold To call the worship of the gods no more Than th'issue of credulity, produc't To fright us with a name that had no power But what our feares allow'd it. Rome is yet Our friend; and 'till she fall from honour, we Must hold her deare. Han. In that consists your danger. Shee's mask't in policy, and like a Statesman Without religion, steeres her course by showes And meere appearance to what ever ends Ambition points her. Be not then too rash. Make not the greatnesse which is yet your owne Derivative from her. 'Twill leave your name A staine in times records, and blot the tables That should preserve it. Prus. Noble Hannibal Be safe with us and confident. I expect The Romane Legates; and if mediation Or any practice which I can with honour Assay to reconcile yee, may be usefull. Han. To reconcile us! Time shall first runne back To his beginning, and the world returne To its first Chaos e're I will admit Of such a word. Let those that fawne upon The smiles of peace and softnesse to delight Their wanton appetites, practise their low Effeminate soules in feares and passions. Each thought of mine shall be a numerous Army To lead 'gainst Rome: in my imagination I will fight with her still, though I want Souldiers. Prus. Nobly resolv'd. Scene the Second. To them Scipio, Massanissa, Flaminius, other Romane Legates. Han. Ha! Scipio and Flaminius Amongst the Romane Legates! there's some treachery. Informe thy selfe Himulco. His pursuing Exit. My course, imports no good, and my sad soule Labours with a prophetick apprehension Of something he intends. Be ready thou, Thou my last refuge. Prus. Sudden clouds me thinkes Creepe o're your eyes. Though you be enemies, Peace warrants gentle greeting. Shee is emblem'd In Doves that have no gall. Y'are here my guests, And shall partake a courtly entertainment Worthy such persons. Scip. Hannibal I know Hath put of the rough habit which his mind Was lately wrapt in: and since chance hath made him The subject of my conquest, in the peace Rome hath allow'd his Country (the conditions Being stricktly kept) all past contentions Must lose their memory, and after strifes Be stifled in their first birth by prevention. I must acknowledge my ambition Bo're my thoughts higher than my Countries good, Or her enlargement onely. Had my fortune Captiv'd the person of great Hannibal, My triumph should out-vye all the rich pompes That ever made Rome shine. Han. That person yet Is free, and capable of new designes, To make himselfe full owner of a glory 'Bove Scipio's conquest. Tis not thy successe Declines me the least step towards subjection Of my still high built hopes: which being strongly Propt with my resolutions, shall in time Raise monuments of fame unto my actions. Let not one chance exalt thee. Hannibal, Though Carthage ownes him not, command's a world Greater than her, or Rome. Scip. But the dimensions Are bounded with that strict necessity They cannot be extended. Flatter not Those hopes with expectation of a change To any better than the now condition Of thy subverted greatnesse: which being ruin'd Beyond all reparation, thy attempts To build it new, wanting materials, Are vainer farre than the Sycilian Dogs Barking against the Moone. Han. Be not deceiv'd With too much confidence. The more th'are prest, The more palmes flourish. That that would make Scipio Looke downewards, lifts me up. Scip. How thou art mockt With selfe-opinion! Know I have a soule So full instructed, it hath power to temper The difference of my fortune with that meane, That even the highest glory to my selfe Is but adversity, and an abject state No lesse then is my present greatnesse. Man From outward accidents should not derive The knowledge of himselfe: for so hee's made The creature of beginnings over which His vertue may command: Fortune and chance. When he by speculation hath inform'd His divine part hee's perfect; and 'till then But a rough matter, onely capable Of better forme. It oft begets my wonder That thou a rude Barbarian, ignorant Of all art, but of warres, which custome onely Hath (being joyn'd to thy first nature) taught thee, Shouldst know so much of man. Han. I study man Better from practice, than thou canst from bookes. Thy learning's but opinion, mine knowne truth; Subject to no grosse errours, such as cannot Be reconcil'd, but by production Of new and greater. Did thy learned Masters Of Arts, with whom even arm'd thou hast converst Before a battayle joyn'd (if fame speake truth) By their instructions show thee surer wayes To victory, than Fortune joyn'd to valour, And a full strength of men? Scip. That which consists In action onely, and th'event, depends Vpon no certaine rule demonstrative, Is fates, not reasons. Prus. Fie, this strife sounds harshly, Come Massanissa, you have shar'd your part Of vertue and of fortune. Han. Least of vertue, That left a just cause to support a wrong one; Such was his fall from Carthage. Massa. You being judge In your owne cause: but who will else subscribe To such a partiall sentence? Prus. Pray' no more. My Court lookes like a Parliament of Souldiers; Where warre me thinkes should be discours'd on; how A battaile should be order'd, or what forme Hath most advantage. What men have you knowne, Or History doth mention, that exceeded In the degrees of merit? Han. Alexander The first best Captaine. Scip. Who the second? Han. Pyrrhus. Prus. And who the third? Han. Doubtlesse my selfe. Scip. What then Am I that conquer'd Hanniball? Han. If I Had conquer'd Scipio, I had then beene first. Scip. Did ever pride so swell th'infected parts Of a rich soule! Were not his mind corrupted With that disease of vertue, I should covet To joyne mine with't in an eternall fellowship; And onely here in outward enmity Divide our bodies. Scene the last. To them Himulco. Han. How art satisfy'd? Am I yet safe? Him. My observation Hath beene I feare too curious: for your danger If any be intended wants all meanes Of opposition. But my feare perhaps Interprets worse than a consideration Will from the circumstance; which yet hath shew Of probability. Han. Why what hast seene? Him. Arm'd troupes guard all the passages by which The house is enter'd. Han. I am then betray'd. Can Kings be trecherous? have they mortall parts Subject to that corruption staines with leprosie The glorious brow of honour! Can creation Be in her different workes so negligent As not to perfect them? Shee's idle when She makes Kings, should be like gods, lesse then men. Prusias and Scipio, thus I mock your plots. Be trecherous now; you shall have nothing but Hannibals earth to worke on. Takes the poison. Scip. What's the meaning Of this? Massa. Tis poison surely that he takes. Scip. Restraine him. Han. 'Tis too late. Prus. Call our Physitians. Han. All helpe is vaine as your conspiracy. It was no juggling sop to wrap the senses In slumbers like death, Colchos never yeelded A juyce more banefull. I went still prepar'd Thus to o'recome your malice; which discover'd, My death beares me above it. Scip. Why should Hannibal From the weake warrant of a bare suspition Be guilty of such barbarousnesse I By all The hopes I have of good mens loves, or memory 'Mongst their true valuing of desert, I ever Restrain'd m'uncertaine thoughts their liberty From being busie 'bout betraying Hanniball By any practise honour might not father, And gladly call his owne. Han. Perswade thy flatterers To credit it: Those that would deifie The vertues in thy booke, not of thy mind. Practice hath taught me how to read mens soules. Doe not I know then thy hypocrisie Plasters the wounded credit of thy act! But if thou healst it, there will be a scarre To shew posterity that what thou didst Was full of base corruption. Scip. Thou didst much Lessen thy selfe in thy first feare; and now By the ill-grounded jealousie of my vertue Wilt make thy owne taxt. From this Pædia I have beene truely morall; th'institutions Have beene my guides in every action Which I did either as a man, or Prince. Cyrus himselfe, to whom they were directed, Pursu'd them not so strictly as I have. Breath not thy soule forth then 'till thou art satisfy'd Of my true innocence: for if thou dy'st In thy suspition, be assur'd it will Disturbe thy peace hereafter, and thy ashes, As the pile hallows them, will fright thy ghost With shapes of the dishonour thou unjustly Would lay on Scipio. Han. Tell thy Philosophers The earth hath not a center; that the day Is not illumin'd by the Sunne; that fire Is colder than the ever-frozen rocks That beare the North-end of th'earths Axel tree: When they allow these paradoxes, I Will credit Scipio. Worke on thou brave minister Of my last victory over my selfe. Quench thy unnaturall flames with my scortcht bowels. Now thou hast met a heat, which joyn'd to thine Makes all the frame like the bright forge, whence Jove Hath his artillery. My heart, my heart; Quench it Eridanus: but it would dry Thy waters up. I'm wrapt in greater fires Then the rash boy thou choak'st. Would this were Octa; That like the furious Thebane I might build Mine owne pile, and the flame as it ascends Transforme it selfe into a constellation; Or fixe ith' upper region of the ayre Like a perpetuall comet to fright Rome With his prodigious light. Me thinkes an earthquake Totters the aged fabrick that so long Hath borne me on't, and the divided poles Embrace to kisse each other. An inversion Of natures order shall attend the fate Of dying Hannibal. So Okes eradicated By a prodigious whirlwind, teare the earth Through which their large rootes spread themselves. (Ile have No lesse then the whole world to be my grave. Scip. He's dead: with him my glory. Scipio's acts Dy's. Have not another object worthy them, Or his attempts. Him. Fame breake thy trumpet now; Deafe thy wide eares, and silence all thy tongues Since he's dead, who with his actions wont To ympe new feathers to thy broken wings, And make thee fligh a pitch above the reach Of common eyes. Prus. Lest that my honour suffer In the suspition of betraying him, I will provide a lasting monument, And fixe his statue on't. Scip. You Massanissa Ile see establisht in your Kingdome. Carthage Thy base ingratitude to him, whose merit But justly challeng'd all that thou could'st owne Shall teach me a prevention. Solitude Is the soules best companion. At Linturnum My Country Villa I will terminate My after life free from mens flatteries, And feare of their leane envie. He that suffers Prosperity to swell him 'bove a meane, Like those impressions in the ayre, that rise From dunghill vapours, scatter'd by the wind, Leaves nothing but an empty fame behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue by Scipio. Our strife is ended: yet in ones I spy Peace smile, and warre frowne in anothers eye. Being victorious I must not submit To a dislike. Rather to him that writ Our story, gratefully I would allow One leafe of Lawrell torne from mine owne brow. And with their faire opinion of it these May make it a full Garland if they please.
