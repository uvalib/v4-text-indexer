      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ATHENS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Of this your fair and ample city, Plautus Begs a small nook, where he may set up Athens Without the help of buildersâNow, what say you? D'ye grant me my request or no?âThey nod AssentâI thought I should succeed at once.â What if I ask you ought of private property?â Ay, then they shake their headsâBy Hercules! You still maintain, I see, your antient manners; Your tongues are ever ready to deny.â But to the business we are met upon. Our stage is Athens for a little time, Just while we play our ComedyâHere lives [pointing to Phronesium's house. A girl, by name Phronesium:âher manners Are of the present mode: she never asks Her lover what he has already given, But as to what remains, she does her best By asking and by taking: so that nothing Is left at lastâThis is the women's fashion, They every one will do the same, when once They find they have their lover in a string. Now she pretends she's lately brought to bed; And that a captain's father of the child: More expeditiously to sweep away His money, dust and allâTo say no more, If this girl ever lives to be a woman, His life and fortune will be wholly hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter DINARCHUS. Not a whole life's experience will suffice A man in love, to learn how many ways He may be ruin'dâThat arithmetick Venus don't teach usâVenus, who commands The total sum of all a lover hasâ How many ways he may persuaded be Himself to ruinâThen, what blandishments, And angry moods, by turns a lover meets with, What perils must delight him to encounter! Alas! good Heavens! how must he be forsworn! An annual stipend too, besides his presents Must be paid downâAnd this but her first castâ For this I gain three nightsâMean while, she'll try If you're extravagant, or close; and ask For money, or for corn, or wine, or oil. Just as a man who throws a casting-net, Waits till it sinks, then draws it in, and closes it. If 'tis thrown rightly, then he takes good heed The fish may not escapeâThis way, and that He drags his net; and so confines them, till He draws them outâE'en so a lover's us'dâ If what she asks he gives, is not close fisted, Rather extravagant; she adds some favoursâ Mean while the hook he greedily devours. If a deep draught he takes of love unmix'd, And once the poison mingles with his blood; His credit, fortune and himself are lost. Whene'er his mistress takes a pet, he suffers Doubly, both in his fortune and his mind. Should any other be the happy man, He's miserable; if he seldom sees her, His mind is wretchedâif she often Permits his visits, he indeed is bless'd: But then his fortune runs to wreck and ruin. Such is the way and manner of these brothels. E'er you've oblig'd your mistress with one present, She is prepar'd to ask an hundred more. Some trinket's lost, her robe is torn, a maid Is bought, some brazen or some silver vase, Some costly couch, a grecian tweezer-case, Something or other's always lost, or spoil'd; Which the poor lover must replaceâAnd then All losses, with one common care, we lovers Conceal; while we destroy ourselves, our fortune, Our fame besides, for fear our friends or parents, Should find us outâNow, if we would but take A different course, and what we thus conceal, Impart; they timely would restrain our youth; And what our parents sav'd, would to our sons Descend.âThis would reduce the swarms of rogues, And whores, and such pernicious vermin. Now They are more plenty than are flies at midsummer.â For, if they no where else are to be found, About the banker's shops you see them sitting DailyâAnd I am sure there are more whores Ready to take the money without weighing, Than there are weights to weigh it in the shops. Nor know I why these pandars haunt those places, Unless to serve instead of banker's books, Where their accounts are kept; that you may enter Rather with them directly your accounts, Where you can never afterwards revise them. In fine, in a great city, when at peace From foreign foes all vanquish'd; and where time Hangs on men's hands, in love they needs must spend it, All they whose means afford the price of love. As to myself, this harlot who lives here, Phronesium, from my breast has quite expell'd Her name, and all which her name means, all prudence. But meeting with a man who could give more, A man more lavish of his gold; she turn'd me Out of my post: and yet the jade had call'd him Troublesome, filthy fellow, her aversion. He is a Babylonian captain; who, 'Tis said, is coming hither from abroad. Therefore she has cook'd up this device; for she Pretends she's lying in, only to shut The doors 'gainst me, while he and she alone May live like jovial GreeksâNow she gives out This captain is the father of her child. Why wants the slut a substituted one? What! does she think she can deceive me thus! Or think it possible, had she been pregnant, To have conceal'd her pregnancy from me! For 'tis three days since I arriv'd at Athens From Lemnos, whither I'd been sent ambassador. But who's this woman? O! her maid Astaphium. With her too I have had some intercourse. [stands apart. SCENE II. Enter ASTAPHIUM. Ast. Keep at the door good watch, and guard the house, [speaking to the slaves within. Let none go out more loaded than they came, Nor with hands big, which were brought hither barren. I understand mankind, I know the humours Of our young rakesâWhene'er a jolly set Visit our house, they come with a plot form'd. As soon as e'er they gain admittance, some one Among the crew, assaults my mistress with A storm of kisses: while they're both engag'd, The rest steal, pilfer:âand, if they perceive They are observ'd, they play some monkey tricks, With jokes and sport to entertain the spy. Oft at our cost they eat like sausage-makers. 'Troth, this is fact; and part of the spectators, By Pollux! know I lie notâValorous They think it is to rob the plunderers. But we, with our marauders, know full well, Fairly to make reprisalsâFor they see Their money brought to usâNay more, they bring it Themselvesâ Din. [apart.] In that the jade hit me a slap: For I myself have loaded her with presents. Ast. I recollect, if he's at home, I am To bring him with meâ Din. Ho! Astaphium, stopâ A word before you goâ Ast. Who calls me back? Din. Look here, and you will know. Ast. Who is't? Din. A man Who wishes you much good. Ast. Then give it me, If that's your wish. Din. Look back, and you shall have it. Ast. Psha! you, whoe'er you are, teaze me to death. Din. Thou worst of women, stay then. Ast. My good man, You're troublesomeâBut is it not Dinarchus? 'Tis he indeed;âhe's coming to our house. Din. Give me your hand, and let us walk together. Ast. I am your slave, and must obey your orders. Din. How fares it? Ast. I'm in health, and so are you. Now you're arriv'd, why you must have a supperâ Din. Civilly saidâ Ast. Now, suffer me to go Where I am sent, I beg you would. Din. Go then. What was you saying?â Ast. About what?âWhat mean you? Din. Where are you going? Who is it you're sent for? Ast. The midwife Archiva. Din. You naughty hussey! Ast. As usualâ'tis a part of our profession. Din. You jade, I've caught you in a downright lye. Ast. How so? Din. Because you said just now, you was To bring him with you, you did not say her. You've metamorphos'd now your man, and made A woman of himâA vile slut you are. Ast. A conjurer! Din. But tell me now, Astaphium, Who the man isâIs he some new gallant? Ast. Go, go: I tell you, you're an idle rogue. Din. Idle! How so? Ast. You look for food and cloaths From other's pocketsâ Din. 'Tis not so: my idleness Is owing all to you. Ast. Ay; prithee how? Din. That I'll explain immediatelyâI've spent My fortune in your service, and you've robb'd me Both of my money, and my business too. Had I preserv'd my means, I ne'er had been An idle man. Ast. And can you thus conceive The affairs of love, and the affairs of state Are under different laws? A man engag'd In either, must not be a man of business. Din. Phronesium is the publican, not I:â You misinterpret meâShe has, 'gainst law, Receiv'd large sums of money, and ta'en in Cattle, where I've sole right of pasturage. Ast. And others too who cannot pay their rents, And manage matters ill, are just like you. They blame the financiers. Din. Your pasture farm Has turn'd out ill, I've now a mind to try Some arableâ Ast. Our land is pasture all, If you want arable, apply to those Who let it; ours is for publick use. But there are other financiers enough. Din. I know them both full wellâ Ast. By Pollux! you Have idle time enoughâWhich like you best? Din. You are more saucy, they more often perjur'd. What you give them is lost and sunk at once; With what you get, you eat and drink at least. In short, they wicked are, and you are vain: Fraudulent too; nay more, are good for nothing. Ast. All you have said 'gainst us and them, you've said Against yourself, and turns out in our favour. Din. How can that be? Ast. I'll give my reason for't. Because those who twit others with their faults, Should look at homeâNow you, who think yourself So mighty wise, gain nought from us: but we Great fools, have had our pennyworth of you. Din. You did not use to treat me thus, Astaphium: But courteously, when what you now enjoy Was mineâ Ast. Ay, while a man's alive, we take Some notice of him:âbut when he's departed, We let him restâWe took some note of you While you was living. Din. What! D'ye think me dead? Ast. Can any thing be clearer?âWhat! her gallant In chief, bring nothing now but lamentations! Din. 'Tis your own faults, by Hercules!âYou've been Too hasty; for had you not been so rapid In plundering, I might have held out long. Ast. A lover's like the fortress of an enemy. Din. How prove you that? Ast. Take him by storm as soon As possible, 'twill be the better for His mistressâ Din. Well, I grant you that: but still There's a wide difference between a friend And a gallantâThe oldest friend, I'm sure, Is always thought the bestâBy Hercules! My lands and tenements are not all gone Ast. For heaven's sake, why stand you thus before Our doors, as if you was an alien, and A stranger?âPray go in; you're an old friend. By Castor! in her heart and soul, she loves You best of all mankindâ[aside.] since you have land And houses leftâ Din. Your tongues drop milk and honey, Your hearts are steep'd in gall and vinegar. You give us sugar'd words; but then gallants, When sparing of their purse, do bitter deeds. Ast. I have not learn'd the art of flattery yet. Din. My bounty taught you not to say such things: But those same pinching, niggard rogues, who fight Their inclinationsâYou're a cunning one, Just what you us'd to be, an artful coaxer. Ast. How have we wish'd for your return? For on My word, my mistress was quite wild to see you. Din. How so? Ast. You are the man of all mankind She truly lovesâ Din. [aside.] Well done! my lands and tenements! You've help'd me at a pinch indeedâ[to her.] What say you? Ast. Your meaning? Din. Is Phronesium now at home? Ast. To you she is. Din. And well? Ast. She would be better, If I mistake not, at the sight of you. Din. This is our greatest fault; when we're too much In love, we're sure to be undoneâFor if They tell us what we wish, fools as we are, The most notorious falshood we believe. How by the force of love are we transform'd! Ast. O fye! that can't be true. Din. Say you she loves me? Ast. Yes, only you. Din. I hear she's brought to bed. Ast. Ah! speak not of't, Dinarchus, I beseech you. Din. What now? Ast. I tremble when I hear it mention'd, Phronesium was so near being lost to you. Pray, in and visit her. Wait there a little; She's coming from the bath: she's bath'd already. Din. What say you?âIs it possible she can Be brought to bed, who never was with child? I'm sure I ne'er perceiv'd that she was breeding. Ast. In truth, she did conceal her pregnancy, For fear you should persuade her to destroy The child, or after, or before its birth. Din. By Pollux! who's the father of the child? Ast. A Babylonian captain, whom she now Expects: 'tis said he will be here directly. I wonder he's not come. Din. Shall I go in? Ast. Why not? As freely as to your own house. Dinarchus, you are now one of the family. Din. How soon shall you return? Ast. Why, in an instant. 'Tis but just by, I'm going. Din. Pray return Immediately. I'll wait for you within. [Exit Dinarchus. SCENE III. ASTAPHIUM alone. Ast. [laughing.] My teizing importunity's gone in, My heart's at ease, at last I am alone. Now I may freely speak my mind, say what I wish to say, and in what way I please. I've heard my mistress take her final leave Of this gallant's estateâHis houses and His lands are mortgag'd for his treats to us. But he's become the confidant of all Her secrets, and a friend to advise us, more Than help to maintain usâWhile he had to give, He gave usâNow, to give he has nothing left. For what was his is ours: and what was ours Is hisâIt is the common course of things. Men's fortunes unawares are wont to change One with anotherâHuman life is checquered. Him we remember'd rich, and he us poor. 'Tis now just the reverseâAnd he's a fool Who wonders at it. What! tho' he's in want, It is but just he suffer us to live. 'Twould be a sin in us, to have compassion Upon a spendthriftâSkilful bawds should have Sharp teeth; but smile on all their customers: Should fair bespeak them, but contrive their ruin. A courtezan, in short, should be a briar, And rend and tear whate'er comes in her way. She ne'er should hear a lover's plea; but when His purse is clos'd, dismiss him from her service. He's a deserterâNo gallant's worth hanging, Who han't a total disregard for money. If he, when he has just one present made, Don't please to give another, 'tis meer triflingâ He is the man for us, who what he gives ForgetsâAs long then as his money lasts, Let him indulge in loveâAnd when 'tis gone Contentedly seek out some other business, And to a fuller purse resign his place. Who disregards his own affairs, and spends His fortune, he is a gallant of worth. The men are apt to say 'mong one another, We treat them ill; and are insatiable. But when all is done, how do we treat them ill? No lover ever gave, by Castor's temple! Enough, nor have we e'er receiv'd enough, Nor ask'd enoughâWhat, than an empty purse Is worse?âThe lover who denies to give, Must sleep aloneâWe can't receive enough From him, who ha'nt enough to giveâWe should Be on the hunt to find fresh parties out, Who from unbroken heaps can take, and give Like this young country gull, who lives in here. [pointing to the house. 'Troth, he's a merry mortal, and a generous. To-night, unknown to his father, he will leap The wall, and through the garden come to us. 'Tis him I want to meet with.âBut there is A roaring, boisterous fellow of a slave, When he spies one of us come near the door, Comes out, and hoots and halloo's us away, Just as he scares the geese from off his corn. He too's a country chuffâBut come what may, I'll rapâWho keeps the door?âWho is't comes out? [knocks.] SCENE IV. Enter STRATILAX. Stra. Who a plague's this batters our doors so saucily? Who are you? Ast. I. Why do but look upon me. Stra. What I?âWhy daun't I zee ye? Ah! wae warth thee, What to our house dost come var?âWhat dost knock At our door var? Ast. I wish you healthâ Stra. I ha' Too much of thy health; I daun't care vor't, Iâ I'm zickâPlague! I'd be rather zick than well By thy good wishesâNow, I vain would know What's owing to thee hereâ Ast. Keep closeâ Stra. I do, I hopes, to my 'nown wife: let him who us'd Keep close to theeâWould'st impudence, invagle One from the country, to be nauty with thee. Ast. Keep close your tongue, I would have said. Stra. And zo I would, hads't thou thy fellow on the yerth. Ast. You are too churlish, too ill-manner'd, friend. Stra. Dost thou go on to rag me, woman, ha! Ast. What have I said? Stra. Thou call'dst me churlish, didst'nt, Ill-manner'd tooâIf quickly thou daun't tell me What 'tis thou want'st, and tramp about thy business, By Arculus! I'll trample thee to death, Like as I ha'zeen our zow trample her pigs. Ast. Country, and with a vengeance this! Stra. Is that A shame, thou monkeyâCom'st thou here, adzooks! Thou dress'd out skeleton, to shew thyself, Because thou'st dyed thy cloak a smoaky yellow, And bracelets hast, dost think thyself a beauty? Hussey, come here. Ast. Nay, now you are agreeable. Stra. You lyeâMy question answer thenâ Ast. I'd rather Answer your master, friend, than answer you. Stra. Do'st wear these brass rings to draw in some slave? Ast. They who deserve them best will have them of me. Stra. And an't the trinkums counterfeit? [looking nearer. Ast. Don't touch me. Stra. Touch thee, forsooth! And may my spade so help me, I'd rather at our farm be yok'd wi' an ox, And pig with him on straw, than sleep with thee An hundred nights vree cost, and ha'to boot An hundred zuppersâDo'st twit me wi' living I'the country, just an' thou hadst found a man Who is asham'd of some dishonest prank? But woman, what's thy business at our house? Why do'st run here, whene'er we come to town? Ast. I want to see your women. Stra. What do'st talk To me of women vor? we han't within The hoos a vemale vlie. Ast. Is there no woman Lives with you then? Stra. They're gone into the country. I zay, begoneâ Ast. Why do'st roar so, bedlam? Stra. If thou do'st not run off from hence as vast As e'er thy legs can bear thee, I'll root out Those greas'd, valse, vormal, vrizzled locks of thine. Ast. And why? Stra. Vor daring to come nigh our doors With your perfumes, and with your cheeks all purple. Ast. I only blush'd to hear you clamour. Stra. Blush'd! As tho'f thou'st left thy skin the power to change Its colour, thou has ruddled zo thy cheeks, And zo all o'er bedaa'd thy vlesh wi' paint. You're most abominable jades? Ast. How is it You're pleas'd with these abominable jades? Stra. I knows more than thou thinks vor. Ast. And pray now What is't you know? Stra. How my old measter's son Strabax is ruining himself, and how You draws him in, how cheat, and plunder him. Ast. Was your head quite right, I should call this scandal. None at our house are e'er destroy'd; they spend Their fortunes with us; and when that is done, They may go naked thence whene'er they please. I know not your young manâ Stra. Indeed! Ast. Ay, seriously. Stra. Our garden wall, which loses every night A brick or two, zays plain enough which way He travels to his ruin. Ast. The wall's oldâ What wonder then the bricks should tumble down? Stra. Is this your talking, hussy? Old walls tumble! Zooks! may no mortal man believe me more, If I daun't tell old measter of your tricks! Ast. And, is he boisterous too? Stra. He did not get His money by maintaining harlots, but By living hardâAnd, hildings, now 'tis all Borne off to you, to you, ye six claw'd harpies. 'Tis a bad life you leadâ'Midst o'zuch doings D'ye think I'll hold my tongue?âNo, I'll to Vorum, Tell our ould measter what 'tis you're a'about: An if I daun't, my back will be examin'd. [Exit. Ast. By Castor! if this fellow liv'd on mustard, I should not think 'twould have the power to make him So snappishâBut in troth, he seems to have His master's interest at heart; and tho' He's so outrageous, yet I trust he may By coaxing, and our other harlot's arts, Be made a convertâHorses I have seen, And other beasts made tameâNow to my mistressâ But hold! For see where my aversion comes. How soure he looks! He has not yet, I find, Met with Phronesiumâ SCENE V. Enter DINARCHUS, from Phronesium's house. Din. Fishes, I believe, Who spend their lives in water, do not bathe As this girl doesâWere women to be lov'd Proportionably to the time they spend In bathing, why all lovers would keep bagniosâ Ast. What, can't you bear to wait a little then? Din. By Hercules! I'm tir'd to death with waiting. Ast. Why, I'm so tir'd, I want to bathe myself. Din. Go in, Astaphium; tell her I am hereâ Make hast; persuade her she has bath'd enough. Ast. I willâ Din. But hark ye? Ast. Say, what is your pleasure? Din. Confound me, Gods! how could I call you back! I said nought to youâGoâ Ast. You foolish simpletonâ Why call me back? I might have been from hence A mileâ [Exit. Din. Why stood she at the door so long? Some one she must have waited for, I fancy. The captainâAy, as sure as I'm alive. They're just the same as vulturs; they foresee Three days beforehand, where will fall a carcase; They all gape for him; towards him is the mind Of all; and when he's come, they'll pay no more Regard to me, than if I had been dead Two hundred yearsâAh me! how sweet it is To keep one's moneyâI am punish'd now, Because I've wasted what I had before. Should fortune send an ample fair estate, As long as I the bitter and the sweet Of riches know, I would so hoard it, and Would live so frugally, there should not be In a few days, a single sesterce lost. I would confute to purpose those who blame me. But hold! I prate too muchâThose greedy doors, Which suck up all that comes within their bolts, I do perceive are opening.â SCENE VI. Enter PHRONESIUM. Phro. Pray, my love, D'ye think my doors will bite, that you're afraid To enter?â Din. See the spring! 'tis in full bloom. How sweet it smells! how fair and bright it shines! Phro. But, my Dinarchus, why so ungallant! What! do you not at your return from Lemnos, Salute your mistress? Din. Out upon't! By Hercules! [aside. I shall be lost again most wretchedly. Phro. Why turn you from me? Din. Save you, my Phronesium. Phro. You're welcome homeâSince you are safe arriv'd, You'll sup with me to-day? Din. I am engag'd. Phro. Where will you sup? Din. Where you command me, here. Phro. You'll give me pleasure. Din. I shall give myself Much more; for you'll be with me all the day, Phronesiumâ Phro. If 'tis possible, I will. Din. Give me my sandalsâQuickâBear off the table. Phro. What's now the matter?âAre you in your senses? Din. In troth I cannot drink, I'm sick at heart. Phro. Stay, something must be doneâYou must not goâ Din. My love, you've thrown cold water on me now; My fit is over, take my sandals off. Give me a bowl of wine. Phro. You're now yourself: But have you had a safe and pleasant voyage? Din. By Herc'les yes, since I've the pleasure now Of seeing you. Phro. Embrace me, love. Din. Most willingly. Ah! what sweet honey is so sweet as this? [embracing her. In this I'm happier than is Jove himself. Phro. What! not a kiss to give? Din. Ay, ten. Phro. You are Not poor in themâmore than I ask, you promise. Din. Would from the first, I had been of my money As frugal, as you're generous of your kisses. Phro. Could I but help you save, in truth I would. Din. Have you done bathing?â Phro. For myself I have; In my own eyes, I'm clean enoughâTo you Do I seem dirty?â Din. By no means to me. But I remember that there was a time When for each other we had no regard. But what is this I hear since I'm come home? What in my absence have you been about? But I rejoice you have escap'd the danger. Phro. I've ever made a confidant of you. I have no child, nor ever been with child. 'Tis true I feign'd I wasâ Din. Why so, my life? Phro. By reason of a Babylonian captain, Who here a year resided, and liv'd with me In some sort as his wife. Din. That I found out. But why? What was your scheme in this pretence? Phro. To have some bait, some lure to draw him back. Now he has lately sent me here a letter, That it will prove to what degree I lov'd him, If I preserve and educate the child; I'm then to have his all. Din. That's no bad news. What did you then? Phro. Because the tenth month now Draws on, my mother here has sent her maids Out several ways to find a boy or girl, Which might be pass'd for mine. In short, you know Sura our tire-woman, who lives hard by? Din. I know her well. Phro. At once, she went thro' all The neighbourhood, and hunted for a child. She said 'Twas given her. Din. A pretty business this! So she that bore the child, is not the mother. But you, it seems, have borne it after herâ Phro. You take it rightâThe captain, as he sent Me word, will very soon be hereâ Din. Mean while You'll manage your affairs, as if you'd just Lain in. Phro. Why should I not?âThere will be no Great trouble in't; and, as to the deceit, 'Tis right each use his cunning at his trade. Din. What, when the captain comes, will be my fate? Ah me! Can I forsaken live without you? Phro. When I have gain'd my ends, I shall with ease Between us raise a quarrel, and procure A separationâAfter that, my love! I'll wholly pass my days with youâ Din. I'd rather You'd pass your nightsâ Phro. But I must sacrifice To-day; 'tis necessary to be done. The child is five days old. Din. I think you should. Phro. Dare you not make me some small trifling present? Din. Whate'er you ask me, love, I count a gain. Phro. And so do I, my loveâwhen I've receiv'd it. Din. You'll have it presentlyâI'll send my page. Phro. Pray doâ Din. Be't what it will, receive it kindly. Phro. I know you'll send me, what I need not blush To takeâ Din. Well! Have you any more commands? Phro. Only, when you have any leizure, visit me Againâ Din. Farewell. Phro. Farewell to you, my love. [Exit Phron. Din. Immortal gods!âWhat she has just now done, Shews not the foolish fondness of a girl, But th'open, unreserved confidence, And trust, of a most dear and faithful friend. What even one sister would not tell another, She has disclos'd to me, that she has palm'd A child upon the worldâNow she has open'd Her very heart and soul to me; and prov'd She never can be faithless while she lives. Shall I not love her then? Not be her friend? Rather than not love her, I would not love MyselfâAnd, after this, shall I not send her A present?âYes, I'll order her five minÃ¦ From hence directlyâAnd a mina more To buy provisionsâShe's so kind to me, I'll do much more for her than for myself; Since to myself I nothing do but ill. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter PHRONESIUM, [speaking to her Slaves within.] See, give that child the breastâHow miserable, How anxious are mothers, how distress'd! 'Tis a bad business this: and when I think Upon it well, and turn it in my mind, I am convinc'd, we're not esteem'd so bad As in reality we are; and this I speak from what I've just now learn'd at home. What vast uneasiness, what pain I feel, Lest this child's death should ruin all my plot. And I'm more anxious for its life, because I'm its reputed mother, and have dar'd In private to attempt so bold a fraud. 'Twas greediness and thirst of gold, which push'd Me on to this base deed: and made me sham Another's painsâWe never should attempt An act of fraud, unless we are resolv'd To carry it on with craft and diligence. You see I'm dress'd as if I'd just lain in; [to the spectators. And soon shall counterfeit a decent sickness. Whene'er a woman once begins a fraud, Unless she perfects it, she'll find it pain And grief and miseryâIf a good work She takes in hand, how soon will she be weary! But few indeed are tir'd with acting wrong; And fewer persevere in acting right. A woman finds it a much easier task To do an evil, than a virtuous deed. I, partly from my mother's bad advice, And partly from my own bad disposition, Am but a wicked jade 'tis true; who have Thus feign'd a pregnancy; and have declar'd The Babylonian captain as the father. I hope he'll find the plot conducted well. I apprehend e'er long he will be here, And with that previous knowledge I'm fore-arm'd. I'm dress'd as if I had but just lain in. Bring me the oyl of cinnamon, and fire For the altarâI'll now to Lucina pay My adorationâSet them down and leave me. Retire ye from my presenceâHo! Pitheciumâ Get ready for my lying downâCome nearâ AssistâThis suits a woman in the strawâ Take off my sandals, and throw over me My robe, ArchillisâWhere are you, Astaphium? Bring me the vervain, frankincense, sweet wine, And water for my handsâBy Castor! now I wish the captain hereâ [Goes to the back of the stage, and lies down on a bed, as if having just lain in.] SCENE II. Enter STRATOPHANES. Stra. Do not, spectators, Expect that I recount my valorous deeds. My conquests, by my arm I'm wont to publish, Not by my tongueâSoldiers there are, I know, Who tell most marvelous tales.âThere's Homeronida; And after him a thousand might be nam'd, Who have been both convicted, and condemn'd Of vaunting wars, and battles never fought. I don't commend the man, who rather trusts His ears than eyesâIt discomposes me When those are louder in their commendations, Who've only heard reports, than those who saw The deeds perform'd.âAnd one eye-witness weighs More than ten hear-says. Seeing is believing, All the world o'erâI like not him, whose praise Is trumpeted in town by low buffoons, While in the camp, the common men are silent. Nor like I those, whose tongues at home make blunt Our sword's keen edgeâThe valiant profit more Their country, than the finest cleverest speakers. Valour once known, will soon find eloquence To trumpet forth her praiseâIn the same light Look I upon the inactive orator; And her who sings encomiums on the deadâ Praises she has on others to bestow, But none has for herselfâ'Tis now almost Ten months, since last I took my leave of Athens. I'll to my mistress, whom I left with child, And see what she's aboutâ Phro. Who's talking there? [to Astaphium. Ast. The captain's hereâStratophanes is come. Phronesium, now's your time; feign yourself ill. Phro. Peace then!âD'ye think that I want your advice? Can any of you all exceed my cunning? Stra. She's brought to bed, I'll answer for't! Ast. Suppose I speak to him. Phro. Ay, goâ Stra. See here, Astaphium Is coming to me. Ast. Hail! Stratophanes! I'm glad you're safe arriv'dâ Stra. Well, that I know. But is Phronesium brought to bed? Ast. She is; And of a charming boyâ Stra. Is he like me? Ast. Why ask you such a question?âwhen the moment The boy was born, he ask'd for sword and target. Stra. Yes; he is mine; the proof is quite apparent. Extremely like me! wonderfully so! Is not his size already large?âAlready Has he not chose what legion he would plunder? Ast. Why yesterday he was but four days old. Stra. What then?âsomething by this he should have done. Why was he born before he could engage In battle? Ast. Follow me, and greet my mistress; And give her joyâ Stra. We'll follow you. Phro. O heavens! Where is she?âGone! and left me here alone! Ast. I'm hereâAnd I have brought your long desir'd, Your lov'd Stratophanesâ Phro. Where is he, pray? Stra. The god of war returning from abroad, Salutes his wife NerieneâSince you have had Success, and since with children you are bless'd; And since you've honour'd both yourself and me, I give you joyâ Phro. You, who've of day-light robb'd me, Of my life too almost, right welcome are you. You, who have been the cause of all I've felt, And all I feelâ Stra. O fye! my love! this pain Is for your interestâYou've produc'd a son Will fill your house with plunderâ Phro. Ah! by Castor! We want much more to have our granaries fill'd; Lest famine starve us e'er his plunder comes. Stra. Have a good heartâ Phro. Ask me to kiss you here, then? I've been, and still I am so much in pain, I can't lift up my head, nor stand upon My feet without assistance. Stra. O my sweet! If from the mid-sea you would bid me fetch A kiss of yours, I should not think it trouble. You have experienc'd that already.âNow I'll prove how much I love you, my Phronesium. I've brought you here two maids from SuriaâHere, [to a slave. Produce themâThese are yoursâThey both were queens At home.âBut I have wasted and destroy'd Their countryâ Phro. Don't the number I've already Displease you; notwithstanding, do you bring me More maids, to eat me out of house and home? Stra. By Hercules! if this present you dislikeâ Here, boy, give me the bag thereâSee, my love, Here is a Phrygian robeâI pray accept it. And one from Pontus tooâTake it, my love. Phro. For all my grievous pains, d'ye make me such A trifling present? Stra. I'm undone, by Hercules! Ah, me! my son will cost his weight in gold. She does not value me a rushâI've brought you, See here, from Tyre, a beauteous purple robeâ Accept itâNow remove these Surians here, Out of her sightâDon't you love me a little? Phro. By Castor! not at allâYou don't deserve it. Stra. Will nothing satisfy her? She han't said One kind word to meâI am sure, the presents I've made her now, would sell for twenty minÃ¦. She's desperate angry with me now, I know, And feelâBut I'll go to herâWell, what say you? Would you, my love, that I should go and sup Where I'm invited; then return, and sleep With youâWhy are you silent?âWithout doubt I'm ruin'dâHey!âWhat have we here?âWho's he That leads this grand procession?âI'm resolv'd To watch which way they goâI do suppose To herâbut I shall presently know more. [stands apart. SCENE III. Enter GETA, followed by slaves, with presents from his master Dinarchus. Geta. Hey! gee! hey, mules!âCome this way both of you, You who bear loss and ruin to my master; Who his goods carry off from home, together Drawing a cart-full of them at your tails. The man who's heartily in love, must be Quite good for noughtâHe takes incessant pains, And uses art to rob himselfâNor ask, How I know thisâA master of the art We have at home, who looks upon his furniture As dung; bids it be carried outâHe fears The Ãdiles, one would think; as it's their order That all things be kept cleanâHe is resolv'd To have his house quite free from dirt; and so All that is in it he sweeps clean awayâ By Hercules! then since he is determin'd On his own ruin, I shall privately Assist: he'll not be ruin'd much the sooner, For that; since from a single mina here For these provisions I have only crib'd Five pieces; Hercules's share, a tenth. 'Tis as you'd turn a stream upon your field: Which if you do not, it will all run wast Into the seaâMy master's money here Runs wast: 'tis spent most wretchedly, I'm sure, And without credit too; when I observe Things go on thus, I pilfer, I purloin A little plunder from the general spoilsâ I can't but think a courtezan is like The sea; she swallows every thing you give, Yet ne'er o'erflowsâNay worse; for what you give To her, is lost, and ne'er appears again. But what the sea receives, the sea at least PreservesâNow here this courtezan has brought My wretched master, by her wheedling wiles, To want; and robb'd him of his fortune, friends, His honour, and his lifeâHow now! she's here; Just by; I wish she ha'n't o'erheard my prate. She's pale, as just deliver'd of a childâ I'll talk to her, as if I did not know itâ Save you!â Phro. Our Geta!âWhat are you about? How do'st?â Geta. I'm wellâAnd sent to you, who are Not wellâI bring a med'cine with me here Will make you betterâYour dear love, my master, Bid me these presents bring, which you may see Conveying hither; these five minÃ¦ too. Phro. In troth, I have not lov'd him so for nought. Geta. He bade me beg you to accept them kindly. Phro. I do so, and with thanksâOrder them in. Go, CyamusâWhat! don't you hear my orders?â Geta. They sha'n't bear off the vasesâI will have them Air'd first.â Phro. How troublesome's this saucy fellow? Geta. Do you in earnest call me saucy fellow, Who are yourself the sink of vice? Phro. But tell me Where is Dinarchus? Geta. He's at homeâ Phro. Then tell him, For these his gifts, I love and honour him Of all mankindâI beg he'd visit me. Geta. ImmediatelyâBut, who's that fellow there, With those malignant eyes and woeful countenance? He feeds on his own spleen, whoe'er he is, And pines in thought, I'll swear. Phro. 'Troth he deserves it. Geta. Who is it? Phro. What! not know him? Why, 'tis he Who liv'd with me, the father of my child. He order'd me to bring it up, and gave me But scarce enough to serve him for a breakfast. His orders I obey'd, and watch'd and waited. Geta. I know him well, a good for nothing rogue. Pray is that he? Phro. The very same. Geta. He eyes me Groaning, and from the bottom of his breast He fetches deep his sighsâObserve him now, He grinds his teeth together, smites his thigh. Why sure the man is mad, to beat himself. Stra. Now will I rouze my indignation up, And utmost furyâSay! Whence are you, tell me Whose scoundrel slave? How do you dare to speak Uncivilly to me? Geta. Because I chuse it. Stra. And is it thus you dare to answer me? Geta. Yes, thus; I do not value you a straw. Stra. [to Phron.] And what say you? How dare you own you love Another man? Phro. I like another man. Stra. Ay, say you so at last? I shall try first If for a shabby present of mean pot-herbs, Of butcher's meat, and sour wine, you'll love A curl'd, effeminate voluptuous fribble, A fellow of no mark nor likelihood. Geta. Rascal! how now! dare you abuse my master; Spring-head of wickedness and perjury? Stra. Say one word more, I'll crumble you to atoms. Geta. HoldâTouch me but, I'll make a lamb of you; I'll quarter youâIf you're in the army A famous warrior; I'm i'th'kitchen, Mars Himself. Phro. If you was wise, you would not blame My visitors, whose gifts, with pleasure I Receive, and thanks: while yours are odious to me. Stra. Then I have lost my presents, and my thanks. Geta. That's a clear caseâWhat stay you here for then? Impertinence!âYou have confess'd yourself Undone and lostâ Stra. I am undone to-day, Indeed, if I can't drive this fellow off. [coming towards Geta. Geta. Move but this way!âdo but come here! Stra. Do you threaten? You ragamuffin! NowânowânowâI'll mince you To mammocksâWhy, come hither? Why, to her? I say, how didst thou come to know my mistress? If you but move a hand, I'll murder you. Geta. What!âShould I move a hand? Stra. Do as I bid you. Stop hereâNow will I cut you into chops. Geta. [aside.] I'd best march offâWhy this is not fair play. [to him. You have a longer sword than mine by farâ Since we must fight, permit me but to fetch A spitâI'll just step homeâI'll chuse No partial judge between us, man of warâ But wherefore do I tarry loit'ring here, [aside. And not pack off, while with whole bones I may? [Exit. SCENE IV. Phro. Give me my sandalsâLead me in this minute. The wind has made my head ache desperately. Stra. What's to become of me? For these two maids I gave you, make my heart ache desperately. [Phron. is led in. What are you gone! A ha! have I bestow'd My presents thus? I'm finely fool'd, indeedâ What! suffer this? How little would persuade me Instant to turn this whole house topsy-turvy? Is any thing so greedy as these women? Having a boy, she plucks her spirit upâ This is as if she said, I neither ask, Nor yet forbid you to come inâBut I Will notâI won't go inâIn a few days I'll make her say I am a man of blood.

One morning, not long since, my father sent me Into the country hence, to give out fodder To feed our oxen; scarce got I there, when One came up to our farm, (so't pleas'd the gods!) Who ow'd my father money: he had bought, It seems, Tarentine sheep of himâHe ask'd Where was my fatherâWhy, in town, I answer'd him. And then I ask'd what was his business with him. He took his purse from off his neck, and gave me Just twenty minÃ¦. Gladly I receiv'd them, And stuff'd them in my purseâAway went he, And strait to town I've brought these fleeceless sheep Stow'd in my purseâBy Pollux' temple! Mars Is desperately enrag'd against my father, His sheep have strol'd so very near the wolves. Now all your finical, fine town gallants, With this one stroke I'll set adrift, and turn them Strait out of doorsâMy father I'm first fix'd To ruin: then my motherâNow, to her, Whom I much better than my mother, love; I'll take the moneyâWho's here?âNobody?

Hark you me! Zinse to and fro I've trudg'd so oft to town, I'm grown a banterer, a nice poker tooâ Ast. Astonishing!âWhat means that nonsense, prithee? Joker you would have said, perhaps. Strat. Ay, joker, Or poker; there's no such mighty difference. Ast. Follow me in, my loveâ Strat. Here, take these boli, As earnest, that you'll come to me anon. Ast. Merciful!

There's not begotten, born, nor can be found, Whom I would have more prais'd, more gratified, Than VenusâYe great gods! how I rejoice! I'm overwhelm'd with joyâWhat ravishing news Has Geta brought to-day!âPhronesium sets A value on my gifts, and loves them dearly. And 'tis not only this which charms me, but What most delights me is, the Captain's gifts Are ill receiv'd; nay more, are odious to her. I'm all in rapture; for if he's dismiss'd, The day's my own; my girl will live with me. I in my ruin plainly find my safety. Without such ruin I had quite been lost. Now will I watch what they're about, and who Comes out, and who goes in hereâAt some distance What's like to be my fate, I can observe. But still one thing disturbs me much; for now Since all my fortune's spent, I must depend Entirely on another's will and pleasure. SCENE II. Enter ASTAPHIUM [speaking to PHRONESIUM as she comes out.] Ast. I'll do my duty well, see you do yours As well withinâLove what you ought; your interest. While he is willing, fleece him:âwhile he has To give, why humour now the opportunity. Call forth your graces, feast him with your charms: I will preside and manage here without. While he exports his father's goods to us, I'll not admit a creature to be troublesome. Go on to fleece, and strip him at your pleasure. Din. Ha! who is this! Astaphium! Prithee say, Who's this, who now is on the brink of ruin? Ast. Was you here, marry! Din. Am I troublesome! Ast. More now than formerlyâFor he by whom We nothing get, to us is troublesomeâ But give me leave to say what I would say. Din. What is't?âConcerns it me?â Ast. No, not a jot. There's one within who gives by heapsâ Din. What now? Some new gallant? Ast. A full and untouch'd hoard She has seiz'dâ Din. Who is't? Ast. Don't mention it, I tell you, Don't you know Strabax? Din. To be sure I doâ Ast. He is a prince with us; he's our estateâ He spends his cash with spiritâ Din. How! By Hercules! Then I'm undone indeedâ Ast. Indeed you areâ A simpleton, who would with words undo What is already doneâBut so did Thetis Mourn her lost son with funeral lamentations. Din. Can I not be admitted? Ast. And why rather You, than the Captain?â Din. Why?âBecause I've given Her moreâ Ast. You oftner had admission thenâ Others you should permit, for what they give To use their timeâYou've learn'd your A, B, C. Since you are perfect, theirs let others learn. Din. Why let them learn, so I may con my lesson, For fear I should forget my learningâ Ast. But, While you, a master, exercise your brain, Why she will do the same with hersâ Din. How's that? Ast. She'll ever and anon expect some money. Din. I sent her, it is but to-day, five minÃ¦; Yes, and one more besides, to buy provisions. Ast. And they were bought I know; we now regale Upon your courtesyâ Din. What! shall my enemies Feast here at my expence? By Hercules! I swear, I'd rather suffer death than bear it. Ast. My enemies I wish should envy me, Not I my enemiesâTo see another Happy, is pain and misery to you. Who envies, pines in poverty and want; While the objects of his spleen abound in wealth. O you are mighty simple!â Din. How's that? Ast. Waitâ Din. Why so?â Ast. Because I chuse you should. Din. And not At least be sharer of my own provisions?â Ast. If that was your intent, to your own house You should have order'd halfâFor our receipts Are just like those of Acheruns; we all Receive; but what comes in, returns no moreâ Farewellâ Din. Stay, stopâ Ast. Let me alone; be quiet. Din. WellâthenâBut I'll go inâ Ast. To your own house. Din. Noâbut in hereâ Ast. That's quite impossible. Din. 'Tis very possibleâLet me but try. Ast. No forcible entryâWait here, and I'll tell her, You're come, unless I find she is engag'd. [going. Din. StayâHoldâ Ast. 'Tis all in vainâ Din. Will you return? Ast. I wouldâBut hark! I hear one call, whose voice Is louder far than yoursâ Din. One wordâ Ast. Well, say it. Din. You'll let me in?â Ast. You fibâGo toâYour word You've multiplied; for you've said fourâall fibs. [Exit. Din. She's fled, gone inâWhat! shall I bear all this? I'll make a riot, and expose you here Before your proper doors; trickster, I will By Hercules!âThou, who against the laws From numbers hast extorted money, now There's not a magistrate in town, but I Will lay thy name before; and then for quadruple, Will seize upon thee, thou vile sorceress, Who dost steal boys, and pass them for thy own. I'll publish to the world thy wicked deeds. I'm now not worth a sesterceâI've spent all I hadâI'm desperate grown, and reckless now What shoes I wearâWhy do I clamour here? Suppose she would admit me nowâMost solemnly I swear, I'd not go in, tho' she intreated me. This railing is but loss of timeâWho strikes A goad, will feel the smartâTo vent your rage 'Gainst her, who does not care a straw, is folly. But who is this!âGood gods! I see old Callicles; Who once was to have been my near relationâ He brings two girls with him in bonds, the one Phronesium's tire-woman, his own maid t'other. I'm in a dreadful frightâFor added to The present grief, which wounds my heart, I fear My old bad pranks will now be brought to light. SCENE III. Enter CALLICLES, his MAID, and SURA, bound. Cal. [to his maid.] Speak I to you ill language?âOr to you? [to Sura. Bear I a mind malicious?âBoth of you In my opinion, have well nigh experienc'd How gentle and how mild a man I am. For when you both were scourg'd, and both examin'd, I recollect, and know how every thing You then confess'dâNow, here I fain would see, If without torture, you will own the same. But mind, I plainly tell you both beforehand, Tho' of the serpent kind you are, beware You speak not different language, lest for aye I stop your double tongues; unless you chuse To go to those will make the lashes smack Upon your backsâ Maid. I must perforce confess The truth, the thongs so wring and gall my arms. Cal. Confess the truth, and you shall be unbound. Din. [aside.] I know not what to make of this affair; I only know I'm in a horrid fright. Maid. I'm yet to learn what crime I have committed. Cal. Stand first of all apartâThus I, observe, Would have itâMark, and use no signs between you. I'll be a screenâSpeak youâ [to his maid. Maid. What shall I say? Cal. Say what's done with my daughter's child, my grandson? Tell me from first to last. Maid. I gave it herâ [meaning Sura. Cal. Now hold your tongueâYou took the child then from her? [to Sura. Sur. I did. Cal. Well, peace! I stand on nothing else. You have confess'd enoughâ Sur. I shan't deny it. Cal. By this you've made a plaister for your back. As yet they both agree in what they say. Din. [aside.] Wretch that I am, my wicked deeds are now Disclos'd, which I have hop'd would ne'er have come To lightâ Cal. Do you speak now: [to the maid.] Who bid you give The child to her?â Maid. 'Twas my old mistress, Sir. Cal. Now what say you? [to Sura.] Why did you take it of her? Sur. Why, my young mistress beg'd I would procure A child, and keep the whole a secret, Sir. Cal. Speak you againâWhat did you with the child? Sur. Why, I convey'd it to my mistress strait. Cal. Well, what did she with't? Sur. She to my mistress Directly gave itâ Cal. To what mistress, carrion? Sur. I have two mistressesâ Cal. Mind what you say. Answer to what I say; my questions only. Sur. Why then I say, the mother, my old mistress, The infant gave directly to her daughter. Cal. You did not say so much just now. Sur. Nor did You ask so muchâ Cal. Come, answer me more speedily. Now, she who had the child, what did she with it? Sur. She made it pass forâ Cal. Whose? Sur. For her own child. Cal. For her own child! good Heaven! with what a deal More ease, a stranger bears a child, than does The real mother! Here is one has brought A child into the world, and felt no pain. A happy child indeed, and doubly blest, Since it two mothers, and two grandams has. I fear it has more fathers too, than one. See, see the wicked ways of women! Maid. Troth This fraud had more of man than woman in it. It was a man, and not a woman got The childâ Cal. Ay, I know that as well as you. You've been a trusty guardianâ Maid. Why, the weakest Goes always to the wallâHe was a manâ Was strong, and conquer'dâWhat he ask'd, he tookâ Cal. And brought you into misery. Maid. You need not Tell me the thing I know, by sad experience. Cal. Cannot I make you tell me, who's the father? Maid. I've kept it secret hithertoâBut now It all must outâFor since he's present here, I must perforce declare itâ Din. [aside.] I am petrified. Wretch that I am! I dare not stirâ'Tis all Discover'd now; I'm trying for my life. It was my folly, my foul deed: I fear She'll name me soonâ Cal. Tell me, who was't debauch'd My virgin daughter? Maid. Why, I see him by you. Cal. Hussy! who is't? Maid. He who supports the wall. Din. I'm nor alive, nor deadâNor do I know What I've to doâHow shall I face him? How Get off?âI'm stupified with fearâ Cal. Well, will you Tell me, or no? Maid. Dinarchus; he, to whom You had before espous'd herâ Cal. And where is he? Din. Here, I am, Callicles: and by these knees Adjure you, that what I with folly did, You would with wisdom bear, and pardon meâ Wine was the cause; reason had lost her sway. Cal. I like not thisâYou throw the blame on that Which can say nothing; for, could wine but speak, Wine would defend its causeâ'Tis not for wine To guide and rule men's conductâWine is but The slave of virtuous men; and, the debauch'd, Whether they drink, or whether they abstain, Will be debauch'dâThe fault is in their hearts. Din. Many reproaches I must hear, I'm sensible, Which I would notâI own besides, I have Offended youâI'm privy to the crime. Maid. I beg you would not injure any, Calliclesâ While the defendant pleads his cause at large, You keep the witnesses in bondsâ Cal. Unbind them. There, get you goneâ[to the maid.] Do you go homeâAnd you [to Sura. The same; and tell your mistress to restore The child where 'tis demandedâAs to you, Dinarchus, you must go before the PrÃ¦tor. Din. Why summon me before the magistrate? Yourself shall be the judgeâAnd, Callicles, I beg you would consent that I may marry her. Cal. By Pollux! I perceive how you had judg'd The thing, yet would not stay for my consent, But serv'd yourselfâAs you have caught her, take herâ I'll fine your folly tho'âI shall deduct For that, six Attic talents from her fortune. Din. You treat me kindlyâ Cal. You had best demand Your son, and, soon as possible, take home Your wifeâI'll strait return my kinsman's messenger, And let him know, he must look out his son Some other matchâ [Exit. Din. I'll claim my child, for fear She should deny itâBut that can't be, for she Had openly declar'd the whole to me, And of her own accordâBy Pollux! see, Most luckily she's comingâOn my word She has a long sting to wound my heart from thence. SCENE IV. Enter PHRONESIUM and ASTAPHIUM. Phro. She's an insipid and a dirty trollop, Who even in her cups neglects her interest. Tho' she is over head and ears in wine, Tipsy from top to toe, yet let her mind At least be soberâI am vex'd at heart, Poor Sura has been treated so severely. The child is prov'd to be Dinarchus' son: She saidâWhere heard she that?âYet all I have, Children and all are hisâLook here! I see The man who made me guardian of his fortune. Din. Woman, I'm come to youâ Phro. What would you have My love? Din. No loveâTruce with your fooleries. I've nothing more to do with themâ Phro. I know What 'tis you want, and what 'tis you demand, And what you seek forâTo see me was what You wanted; you demand my love, and seek for The childâ Din. Immortal gods! how plain she speaks! And how concisely to the point she comes! Phro. I know you are betroth'dâI know you have A son by your betroth'dâand soon you are To marry her; and in another place Your heart's now fix'd, and I'm to be forsaken. But ne'ertheless reflect, the little mouse, How sage a brute it is! who never trusts Its safety to one hole: for when it finds One entrance is block'd up, it has secure Some other outletâ Din. Well, when we have leisure, We'll discourse farther of these mattersâNow Restore the childâ Phro. Nay, only a few days I beg, you'd suffer him to be with me. Din. By no meansâ Phro. DoâI beg you doâ Din. For what? Phro. 'Tis for my interestâBut for three days only, 'Till I can some how trick my noble captain. If I have any gains, you shall have part. Take the child from me, and you kill all hopes I've in the Captainâ Din. Well, I wish it soâ But there's no room for me to make that wish Effectual, if I wouldâNow you've the child, Do your best with it, and take care of it: You've wherewithalâ Phro. And for this kindness, I By Castor! love youâAnd whene'er you fear A scolding bout at home, fly here to me, And be at least an useful friendâ Din. Farewell, Phronesium. Phro. Don't you call me then your love? Din. That name may now and then by stealth be mention'd. Phro. Any thing else? Din. Be mindful of your health. When I have need, I'll visit you again. [Exit. Phro. He's gone, he's fledâNow I may speak my mind. The proverb's trueâBest friends are sometimes troublesome. On his account, the captain saw himself Shut out to-day; whom, better than myself I love, by Castor! So I gain my endsâ But when all comes to all, to say no more, Little remains of what we get by tradeâ Such are the glories of a courtezan! Ast. Hist, Hist! Phronesium! Phro. What's the matter now? Ast. Here is the father of the childâ Phro. If he, And only he, let him come when he will, And come the nearest roadâBy Castor! if He comes, I by my artifice will ease him, First of his cashâThen pack him off again. [Exeunt.

If heretofore, my love, I've been to blame, I bring you some amends for't now, a minaâ And, if you won't believe me, why examine it. Phro.
