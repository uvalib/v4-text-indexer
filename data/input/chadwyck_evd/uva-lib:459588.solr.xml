      <field name="fulltext">To Signior No-body. Worthlesse sir, I present you with these my vnperfect labours, knowing that what defect in me or neglect in the Printer hath left vnperfect, iudgement in you will winke at, if not thinke absolute. Being to turne a poore friendlesse childe into the world, yet sufficiently featur'd too, had it been all of one mans getting, (woe to the iniquitie of Time the whilest) my desire is to preferre him to your seruice: in which, as he shall be sure to get nothing, so likewise my hope is, he shall not loose much: For your bountie neither makes straungers loue you, nor your followers enuie you: you are a Patrone worthie the Sister-hood, I meane, the poore halfe dozen, for the Three Elders, they climbe aboue my element: the Sunne, the Moone, and the seuen Stars being scarce worthy the suruey of their workings: I protest I had rather bestow my paynes on your good worship for a brace of Angells certaine, then stand to the bountie of a Better-mans Purse-bearer, or a very good womane Gentlem?-vsher: my reason is I cannot att?d: your Bis dat, qui citÃ² stands so like a Load-stone ouer your greate gate, that I feare, twill drawe all the Iron-pated Muse-mongers about the towne in a short time to your patronage. For mine owne part I had rather bee yours volens, then be driuen Nolens: So till I meete you next at your great Castle in Fish-street, ile neither taste of your bountie, nor be drunke to your health. One of your first followers, Iohn Daye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS I. Scena. I. Enter Octauio Duke of Venice, Hippolito and Francisco his sonnes, Florimell his daughter: Hortensio and others attendants. Octa. Sonnes, hopefull buddes of fruitfull Italy, Hauing banisht war which like a prodigall Kept wastfull reuells with our subiects bloud: Since proude Anthonio our arch-enemy Is in his iourney towards th'vnderworld, Or houers in the shade of banishment; Let vs in peace smile at our victory, And euery brest passe his opinion What pastime best becomes a conqueror. Fran. What sport but conquest for a conqueror, Then with our wounds vndrest, our steeds still armd, Branded with steele ere we wipe of the bloud Of conquerd foes, lets with our shriller bugles Summon the surly Landlord of the forrest, The Kingly Lyon to a bloudy parle, Combat the Hart, the Leopard or the Bore, In single and aduenturous hardyment: The spirit of mirth in manly action rests, Hauing queld men lets now go conquer beasts. Oct. Manly resolu'd; Hippolitoes aduise. Hip. Rather like souldiers, and Octauioes sonnes, Lets throw a generall challenge through the world, For a proud turney, at the which our selues Consorted with a hundred of our knights, Accoutred like so many Gods of warre, VVill keepe the lists gainst all aduenturers, VVhich like the suns light sigurd in a star, Should be a briefe Epitome of war. Oct. Noble and royall, your opinion daughter. Flo. Faith I shall anger souldiers, I woulde poure Spirit of life, Aurum Potabils Into the iawes of chap-falne schollership, That haue since amorous Ouid was exild, Lyen in a sowne, y'aue many holds for war, I would once view a garrison for witte: Twere heauenly sport to see a traine of schollers Like old traind soldiers skirmish in the schooles, Trauerse their Ergoes and discharge their iests Like peales of small-shot, were this motion granted My selfe would be free woman of their hall, And sit as sister at their festiuall. Oct. Haue we not Padua Flo. Yes, but the commaunders Deale with our graduates, as the generall Doth with his souldier, giues him place for fauoure, Not for deseruing, looke intoo't your selfe, You haue Courts for tennis, and me thinkes t'were meet, Learning should not stand balling in the street For want of houseroome: oh tis much vnfit Courtiers should be all pleasure and small wit. Oct. All that you speake is but what we command Flo. But Officers father cannot vnderstand Their Lords at first: wert not a gallant sight, To see wits army royall come from fight? Some crownd with gold, others with wreath of bayes, And whilst they hold their solemn holydaies, Musick should like a louer court the skies, And from the world wrest ringing plaudities. Hip. My sister would make a rare beggar. Fra. True, shee's parcell Poet, parcell fidler already, and they. commonly sing three parts in one. Oct. Wrong neither art nor musicke, they are twins Borne and be got in heate, your thought of both. Flo. I thinke my Lord that musick is diuine, Whose sacred straines haue power to combine The soule and body; and it reason beares, For it is said that the Celestiall spheres, Dance to Apolloes lyre whose sprightly fires Haue tamd rude beasts and charmd mens wild desires: The author was immortall, the first strings, Made by a King, therefore an art for Kings: The world's a body, euery liberall art A needfull member, musick the soule and hart. Oct. VVell for hir sex hath Florimell discourst Of heauenly musicke, and since all conclude It is an art diuine, we were too rude Should we reiect it, musick, I take great pride, To heare soft musick and thy shrill voice chide. Flo. To please your grace, though J want voice and skill, Ile shew my selfe obedient to your will. sing. Fra. This would haue done rare at a schollers window, How do you like it father? âOct. Highly my boies, I rellish all delight, âFor when the fiery spirit of hot youth âKept house within me, I was all delight: âThen could I take my loue, no loue more fayre âBy the smooth hand, and gazing in loues ayre âTell her her beauty beautifide the skie, âAnd that the sunne stole lustre from her eye. Fra. I do admire to heare my princely father thus merrilie discourse of trifling loue. âOct. Nay more my boyes, when J was at your yeares, âI went a pilgrimage through Italie, âto find the shrine of some loue-hallowed saynt, âDeuote to beauty, I would pray for loue, âDesiring beauty I would sue for loue, âAdmiring beauty I would serue for loue: âPray, sue, and serue, till beauty graunted loue. âIf she denyd me I would sweare she graunted, âIf she did sweare that she could neuer loue me, âThen would I sweare she could not chuse but loue me: âLet her sweare nere so much, still haue I sworne, âTill she had said, I should not be forsworne. Flo. I marry brothers, here was cunning loue, Learne like good schollers, heele make you wise in loue: He was a man in loue, were you such men, Then were you men indeed, but boyes till then. Fr. To please my Father, ile inquest of beauty, And neuer make returne till I haue found, A loue so faire, so rich, so honorable, As fits the honor of Octauioes sonnes. Hip. The like (you pleasd) vowes young Hippolito. âOct. Doe boyes, and I will teach you how to chuse them. âElect not mongst whole troupes of Courtly dames, âFor amongst many, some must needs be ill: âThe seld seene PhÅnix euer sits alone, âIoue courted Danae when she was alone: âAlone my boyes, that is the onely way, âLadies yeeld that alone, they els say nay. Flo. An expert souldier; how shall they choose them Father? âOct. If her bright eye dim not the Diamond, âSay it is bright, but brighter iems delight you, âIf that her breath do not perfume the ayre; âSay it is sweet, but sweeter sweets content you. âIf that her cheeke compared to the Lilly, âMake not the Lilly black with whiter whitenesse; âSay it is Lilly white, but black to white, âWhen your cholle white must haue such high exceeds. Flo. Father you do exceed things possible, Faith say how many Ladyes haue you seene, Much fayrer then my selfe, in all your trauayle? Oct. Should the Crow teach me, then no Lady fayrer, If iudgement tell me, then a many fayrer: Thou art myne owne, J must thinke well of thee, Yet Florimella many doe excell thee. Flo. Should the Crow teache, I am not all Crow blacke. Though iudgement; J not all perfection black, Though you haue seene Ladyes that dim the day, Yet will J thinke my selfe as fayre as they. Oct. Doe Florimella, and ile one day get, A husband for thee that shall thinke thee fayre. Fla. And tyme ifaith, that prety sport would be, Wiue it for them, you shall not husband me. Oct. Yet you will take my counsell in your choise. âFlo. Yes, if I had not yeares ynough to choose, âWould you direct me as you doe your sonnes? âWith daughter take a man with such a nose, âWith such an eye, with such a colour beard, âThus big, thus tall, with all his teeth afore; âThus lipt, thus legd, thus handsome, thus apparrelld, âWere not this pittifull! o pittifull: âNow by the soule of soule-commaunding loue, âI will not stoope to such obedience, âI must be bid to blush when I am kist, âBid my loue welcome, and I thanke you sir, âWith no indeed, I know not what loue is, âI neuer heard so much of loue before, âI pray take heede, nay fie you goe too far, âWith such a rabble of prescriptions, âAs neuer mayd of a Conceiuing spirit, âWill follow them, yet brothers goe you on, âTake you good counsell, Flormell will none, Exit. Oct. I daughter? are you so experiencd? An elder woman might haue spoken lesse, Yet by your leaue mynion, ile watch you so, Your I shall still be gouernd by my no. But come my sonnes take patterne of great Ioue, Early ith'morning suit your selues for loue. Exeunt. Enter Anthonio Duke of Mantua, Hermia and Lucida his daughters, they with angels and he with a net. Ant. Go daughters with your Angels to the brooke, And see if any siluer-coated fish, Will nibble at your worme-emboweldhooks: Deceiue the watry subiects, yet the name Of foule deceit me thinks should fray them from you, Alack, alack, I cannot blame the world, That in the world there is so much deceipt; When this poore simple trade must vse deceipt. But with what conscience can J make this net, Within whose meshes all are caught that come: They cousen one at once, this cousens many, I will vndoo't it shall not cousen any. But daughters go practise that little sinne, Ile mend this great fault ere the fault begin. O cousening fortune how hast thou deceiu'd me, Turning me out a doores to banishment, And made another Lord of Mantua. I that was Lord now slaue to misery. Her. Take comfort yet deare father. Ant. Comfort? no: My brest's turnd prison, my proude iaylor woe, Locks out all comfort: whers your valiant brother? Her. All discontent like to a wounded lyon He forrages the woods, daring proude fortune At her best weapon, he accounts this smart, As a slight hurt, but far off from the hart. Anth. How holds his humour? Luc. The same fashion still: But somwhat sadder-colourd death may end But neuer change him, see our words haue raisd him. Enter Aspero. Anth. Fitly applide for a walks like a ghost. Why how now sonne? Asp. Peace. Her. Brother. Asp. Good now peace, VVake me not as you loue me. Luc. VVhat a sleepe? Asp. I, in a most sweet sleepe, blisters o'your tongues for waking me. Anth. Thou forgettest thy selfe. Asp. J should not be a Courtier els, mee thought J was at a strange wedding? Anth. Prithee what wedding? âAsp. Of a young Lawyer and old Madam Conscience. âAnth. I scarce beleeue that. âAsp. Nor J neither, because it was a dreame, but mee thought the yong man doted on the old woman exceedingly. âAnth. That was miraculous! did they liue together? âAsp. In the country they did, and agreed passing well, all the long vacation, and but for two things he would haue carried her vp to the terme with him. Ant. VVhat things were those? âAsp. One was, because her gowne was of the old fashion, the other was cause he would not haue her by when he tooke fees. âAnt. His reason for that? âAsp. For feare if a bribe had bin offered, she being by he shold haue had the bad conscience to take it. âAnth. His wife and he liued together. âAsp. Conscience and the Lawyer, as louingly as men and their wiues do, one flesh, but neither medle nor make one with another âAnt. Man and wife part, thats strange! âAsp. O lord sir, profit can part the soule and the body, and why not man and wife, now you haue had my dreame father, let me vnderstand yours. Anth. How can he dreame, that neuer sleeps my sonne? Asp. O best of all: why, your whole world doth nothing but dreame, your machiauell he dreames of state, deposing kings, grounding new monarchies: the louer hee dreames of kisses, amorous embraces: the newe-married wife dreames, that rid of her young husband she hugs her old loue, and likes her dreame well ynough too: the Country gentlewoman dreams that when her first husband's dead, she marries a knight, and the name of Lady sticks so in her mind, that shees neuer at hearts-ease till she get her husband dub'd; the Captaine, he dreames of oppressing the souldiers, deuising stratag?s, to keep his dreame, and that dreame wakes in the pate of Octauio your Arch-enemy, who is not content to hurle vs into the whirlepoole of banishment, but binds waights at our heeles leaden pouerty, to sinke vs to the very depth that we should neuer rise againe.

Thus should you seeme like louers suited thus, y'oude draw faire Ladies harts into their eies, And strike the world dead with astonishment. Fr.

Fr. Say we desire to husband it with you. Luc. Know we desire no husbands such as you. Hip. A shepheard is an honest trade of life. Her. Yet honest shepheard has with honest trade some strife. Hip. He seldome sweares but by his honesty. Her. So honest men do too aswell as he. Fr. But will you trust a shepheard when he vowes. Luc. No neuer, if his oath be that he loues. Hip. Yet if I sweare, that needs must be mine oath. Her. Sweare not, for we are misbeleeuers both. Fr. Let vs perswade you to beleeue we loue you. Luc. First we intreat you giue vs time to proue you. Hip.

It speech-bereauing loue will let thee speake, Then speechles man, speake with the tongue of loue, And tell me, if thou saw'st not Cynthia Seeking Endimion in these flowry dales. Anth. Dales for Endimion and faire Cynthia fit, But neuer heauenly goddesse blest this groue, These woods are consecrate to griefe, not loue. Fr. Out Atheist, thou prophan'st loues deity, For, false-reporter, I in them haue seene A loue that makes a Negro of Loues Queene: One that when as the sunne keeps holliday, Hir beauty clads him in his best array.

Come, th'art all enuy, feed vpon thy hate, This day our quest of loue shall terminate. Exeunt manet Octauio, Oct. Not if J liue, this maladie of loue, Js grown so strong, it will not be driuen out, To see the folly of a doating father; What toyle I had to fashion them to loue, And how tis doubled to misfashion them. They shall not wed, yet how shall J preuent it? Fearing th'euent I haue forethought a meanes, And here it lies, swaggering becomes not age, Now like the Fox, ile goe a pilgrimage. Frollick my boyes, I come to mar your sport, Your Country musicke must not play at Court. But first, ile write back to Hortensio For apprehension of yong Aspero: They haue not yet dynde, ile bid my selfe their guest Religion beg? a fashion in request. Exit. Enter Aspero and his boy. Asp. Art sure she hates me boy. Boy. More then hir death, J haue bin in hir bosome sir, and this day she intends your execution. Asp. My execution! the reason of hir hate? Boy. Hir humour, nothing but a kind of strange crosse humor in that you reiected hir loue. Asp. Thats not capitall. Boy. Not to crosse a great ones humour? no treason more great personages humours are puritanes, thei'l as liue indure the diuel as soone as a crosse, and can away with him better. Asp. I will submit, aske pardon on my knee. Boy. Is your proud humour come down ifaith, your high humor that would not stoop an ynch of the knees; ile help't vp againe, and't be but to vphold the ieast; I must bring her as low ere I haue done; O base, J woulde rather lay my necke vnder the Axe of her hate, then my sporte vnder the feete of hir humor; but be counselld, ile teach you to preuent both; &amp; perchance make her vpstart humor stoope gallant too. Asp. Ile hold thee my best iewell and thou dost. Boy. And pawne me as poore Lords do their iewells too, will you not? receiue me; you shall counterfet your selfe dead. Asp. The life of that ieast. Boy. It may be she dissembles all this while, loues you, and puts on this shew of hate of purpose to humble you: she may, and I beleeueâ Asp. What? Boy. That most intelligencers are knaues, and some women diss?blers; being thought dead (as let me alone to buz that into the credulous eare of the Court) if she haue any sparkes of loue, theil kindle and flame bright through the cinders of her hart. Asp. If not, Boy. If not, twill be a meanes for your escape: ile say you requested ar your death to be buried at your natiue Citty: and what Courtier, if a Christian can deny that? Asp. I am all thine, my humor's thy patient. Boy. And if I do not kill it, I am not worthy to be your physitian. Exeunt. Enter Florimell and hir Page. Pa.

VVhere none of your proude sex will euer come, I thinke: in heauen. Flo. Is he dead? Boy. See madam, and seeing blush, and blushing shame, that your vngentle humor should be the death of so good and generous a spirit. Discouer Aspero lying on a Table seeming dead. Flo. My Aspero dead! Boy. See madam, what a mutation Flo. I see too much, and curse my proud humour that was the cause of it: Aspero, kind soule, proud sullen Florimell, disdainefull humor, that in one minute hast eternally vndone me: I would not kisse the liuing substance, that being dead doate on thy picture: oh I lou'd thee euer with my soule: O let me kisse this shrowd of beauty: I would not accept thee liuing, that being dead on my knees adore thee: could kisses recouer thee, I would dwell on thy lips: kneele till my knees grew to the ground, deere gentle Aspero she that procurde thy death will die with thee, And craue no heauen, but still to lie with thee. Aspero starts vp. Asp. I take you at your word Lady: Nay neuer recant, I haue witnes on't now: is your proud humor come downe? could you not haue said so at first? and sau'd me a labour of dying? Flo. Liues Aspero? Asp. Liue quotha? sfoot what man would bee so mad to lye in his colde graue alone, and may lie in a warme bed with such a beautifull wife as this will be? haue I tane your humour napping yfaith? Flo. Am I ore reacht? Asp. In your humour Madam, nothing els, and I am as proude on't. Flo. Do not flowt me; and you doe, I shall grow into my humour againe. Asp. In ieast. Flo. In earnest I shall, and then I know what I know. Asp. You may: but and you do, I shall die againe. Flo. In ieast. Asp. Nay in earnest madam, and thenâ Flo. No more, thou hast driuen mee cleane out of conceite with my humor, I loue thee, I confesse it, shalt be my husband, ile liue with thee, thou art my life, and ile die with thee. VVhat more I meane is coated in my looke, If thou acceptst it, sweare, Asp. I kisse the booke. Flo. Boy, run to the master of my Gundelo, and will him attend me after supper at the garden staires, I meane to take the euening ayre, tell him. Pa. It shall be done madam. Exit. Flo. Nay if I say the word, it shall be done Aspero Boy. Look to your selfe my Lord, I lay my life, my Lady means to steale you away to night. Asp. Away? ile call Hortensio, ile not be accessary to your fellony madam. Enter Hortensio and his man Assistance with a letter. Flo. The foole comes without calling. Ass. You shall know him by these signes. Hort. Good figure, very good figure, for as the house is found out by the signe, so must this traytor be sented out by the token, vp with the first signe good Assistance. Ass. A proper man without a beard. Hor. How? a proper man without a beard? we shall scarce finde that signe in all Venice: for the propernesse of a man liues altogether in the fashion of his beard, good Assistance the next. Ass. Faire spoken and well conditioned. Hort. More straunge: you shall haue many proper men fayre-spoken, but not one amongst twenty well condicioned, but soft, this should be the house by the signe, I must pick it out of him by wit. Flo. As good say steale my Lord, what mary-bone of witte is your iudgement going to pick now? Hort. I must, like a wise Iustice of peace, picke treason out of this fellow. Flo. Treason? Hort. I, treason madam; know you this hand? Flo. My roiall fathers: Hor. Then whilst you and your fathers letters talke togither, let me examine this fellow: are you a proper man without a beard? Asp. My propernes sir contents me: for my beard, indeed that was bitten the last great frost, and so were a number of Justices of peace besides. Hort. Tis rumourd about the Court that your name is Aspero. Asp. I am call'd Aspero. Hor. Sonne to the Duke of Mantua that was. Asp. The duke of Mantuaes sonne that is. Hort. Then the Duke of Mantua has a traytor to his sonne, lay hands of him and to close prison with him. Flo. Can he be closer then in my custody? Hort. I do not thinke so madam, but your father has imposde the trust vpon me. Flo. And dare not you trust mee? Hor. With my head if you were my wife, but not with my profit, if you were my mother: will you along sir? Asp. VVith all my heart sir, see what your humour's come to now go my Lord? as willingly as a slaue from the gallies: for as I shall haue a stronger prison, so J shall bee sure of a kinder and a wiser iaylor. Flo. Do you obserue how he flowts you my Lord? that I had bin his keeper but one night longer: but keepe him close, if he escape (though against thy will) as I am a mayd, Hort. A maide against your will. Flo. Shalt pay as deere for't as thou didst for thy office. Hort. If he scape, hang me. Exit &amp; As. with Aspero. Flo. I shall wish thee hangd, if he do not: treason! I may thanke my peeuish humor fort. Enter Page. Page. Madam the Gundelo is ready. Flo. Thou bringst physicke when the patient's dead boy: our ieast's turnd earnest. Pa. Is a dead in earnest? Flo. As good, or rather worse, hee's buried quick. Pa. O madam, many a good thing has bin buried quick and suruiu'd againe, I would bee buried quicke my selfe, and I might choose my graue. Flo. Hee's buried in close prison boy, hee's knowne for the duke of Mantuaes sonne, and by my fathers letter attached for a traytor. Pa. Good gentleman, and I be not sorrie for him: who is his keeper? Flo. The testie asse Hortensio. Pa. Vdsfoot lets enlarge him. Flo. Not possible boy. Pa. Not possible 'tis weele cousen his keeper. Flo. We cannot. Pa. Cannot! we can: your father made a Lord of him, but be rul'd by me, his daughter shall make a foole of him: you are not the first woman has made a foole of a wiser Lord then he is. Flo. Shall he be cousend? Pa. As palpably as at the Lotterie, my brains are in labour of the stratagem alreadie. Exeunt. Finis actus Tertiii.</field>

O strange, cannot you get vp without helpe? there's my gloue, but come no neerer, as you loue me. Hort. I do loue you madam. Boy. Oh blind loue. Hort. True madam; your beauty has made me blind. Pa. Indeed loues sonnes like spaniells are all borne blind. Hort. But they will see. Boy. Not till they be nyne daies old my Lord. Hort. But will you giue mee the fingers that hold this gloue madam? Boy. And the whole body to pleasure you my Lord, but let me go a little. Hort. I will not loose you yet Lady. Boy. But you shall my Lord; hist, then keepe me still. He fastens the gloue to a post. Pa.

Lady? madam? boy; madam, Aspero: but whist, I haue the conceit, 'twas excellent in my Lady, and I applaudit, suppose my Lady and hir prisoner had an intent of priuate busines in the next roome; was it not better in her to blinde me, then I should as gentlemen vshers (cases so standing) haue blinded my selfe? againe, J applaud her, and adore my starres that made me rather a blind then a seeing dore-keeper: shall I interrupt them? no: madam? they haue not done yet, sure they haue not: what haue we here? a base violl! though J cannot tickle the mynnikyn within, ile (though it be somewhat base) giue them a song without, and the name of the Ditty shall be; The Gentleman Vshers Voluntarie.

Fr. Has not Anthonies sonne Sent them by some base practise to their death? Oct. His breasts too full of honor; trusty Iulio? Enter Iulio. What waighty businesse drawes thee from thy charge? Iul. Came not the cause afore me? the proud Mantuans Basely reuolt, deposde me from the seate And chayre of Regentship, sending in quest Of proude Anthonio their late-banisht Duke, Him if they find or Aspero his sonne Enter Assist. Theile reinstall him in the regiment. Oct. Him let them seeke in the vast shades of death, as for his sonne. Ass. Hee's sure ynough my Lord; he was a mad knaue when he came in, but J thinke, I haue made a tame foole of him by this time: for a has neither had bread nor water these foure and forty houres. Oct. More villain thou. Ass. My Lord, Hortensio was the villain, he left such command with mee, hee's the wheele that turnes about, and I a Country Iack must strike when I am commanded. Oct. Although my foe, hee's honorably tempred, Yet armd against my life goe call him forth, Guard in my safety with a ring of steele, And marke how proudly heele demeane reuenge. Enter Assistance and Hortensio bareheaded with his Crowd. Ass. Goblins, spirits, furies, faeryes, the prison is haunted. Oct. With a knaue is't not? Ass. Yes, and an olde foole my Lord, in the likenesse of Hortensio. Oct. Villain where's Aspero. Ass. I know not my Lord: I let him in and my Lady to laugh at him, and it seemes, he consented to treason, and let him out in his apparrell. Hor. They consented togither to cousen me, for taking delight (as my betters may doe) in a foolish pastime called Blindmans buffe, they stole away my gowne, escapt the prison, and left mee in fooles paradice, where, what song I haue playd, my Violl can witnesse, they made me a little better then a bawd my Lord. Fr. In act: Hort. Not meerly in act: sed cogitatione, &amp; id satis est vt inquit Suetonius. Oct. Js hee escapt: and Florimell with him? Hortensio thy head shall answer it. Hort.

Nay you sir too, shall taste of the same sauce, away with both. Flamineo. Come my sonnes, Lets leauy present armes gaynst Mantua. Being scarce come home we must abroad againe, The Common good's a carefull Princes payne. Exeunt. Enter Anthonio, Lucida, Hermia and Lords. Anth. You that in all my banisht pilgrimage, Would neuer alienate your naturall loues, But in desire to see me reinstalld, Haue thrust out proude Octauioes substitute, And seated me in antient dignity, I am yours, and ready at your best dispose. Lord Your owne, my liege, we like inferiour lights Take life from your reflection, for like stars Vnto the sunne, are Counsellours to Kings: He feeds their orbes with sier, and their shine Contend to make his glory more diuine. And such are we to great Anthonio. Anth. The veynes and arteries of Anthonio Through which the bloud of greatnesse flows in vs. Our life, and cause efficient of our state, And these our prety partners in exile. Lord. We ha yet performd but the least part of duetie, Your reinstalment: it rests, that with our bloud, VVe keepe out innouasiue violence. Ant. You new-create me, and breath second life Into my dying bosome, knew my sonne Of this vnlookt for Fortune, but ill Fate Has playd the Traytor, and giuen vp his life To coward treason. A shout within. Enter Aspero and Florimell with their Pages. Asp. Vdsfoot what offence haue I committed against the state, that these yron-handed Plebeians so applaud me for? Flo. Tis a signe they loue you. Asp. I had rather thy should hate me, it makes mee suspect my bosome, for they loue none, but the masters of factions, treasons, and innouasions. Flo. Then you doe not loue the Commons. Asp. Yes, as wise men doe their flattering wiues, only for show: the popular voyce is like a crie of bauling hounds, and they get the foote of a fantasticke and popular-affecting statesman, they neuer leaue him, till they haue chac'd him into disgrace, &amp; then, like hounds, are at a losse, and with their losse, see, I haue found my father, safety attend you. Anth. Welcome thou hope of Mantua and of vs, VVe now are honors new-beginners boy, And may we better thriue then heretofore. Asp. Neuer doubt it father, I haue attractiue stuffe that will draw customers. Anth. VVhat Lady's that. Flo. One that has playd the part of a Constable, brought you home a Runaway. Asp. A friend of mine Father, but daughter to your Archenemy. Anth. Octauioes daughter? Asp. Yes faith, you are out with the Father, and ile see if I can fall in with the daughter. Flo. And am I not a good child to leaue my fathers loue at sixe and seauen, and hazard my honor vpon your sonnes naked promise, and your hopefull acceptance. Asp. She has followed me through much danger. Anth. The better welcome, I loue her for't. Asp. Like her and you please, id'e haue no body loue her but my selfe. Anth. And Lady, though your Father be our foe, The vertuous loue betwixt our sonne and you, May nerethelesse retaine his simpathie. Flo. Shall nerethelesse retaine his simpathy, Anthonio know I am loues resolute, Confirmd and grounded in affection: I lou'd your sonne, not for he was a Prince, But one no better then his present fortunes, Ile loue him still, since first I lou'd him so, Let Father, friends, and all the world say no. Asp. There's mettle Father, how can wee choose but get cocking children, when father and mother too are both of the game. Enter Messenger. Mess. To armes my Lord, Octauio comes in armes To giue a proud assault vnto the Citty. Asp. Proud his assault, as proud be our resist, Vye shot for shot, and stake downe life for life, Our brest's as bold as theirs, our bloud as deepe, All that wee'l loose, or this our gettings keepe. Her. Come brother, talke not of deuouring war, Say messenger, comes not Octauioes sonnes? Mess. They do, as proudly as the morning Sunne Beating the azurd pauement of the heauen. Her. Then feare not father, my sister and my selfe, Will be your champions and defend the Citty. Flo. Why Ladies, haue you such large interest in our brothers. Fr. Princesse, we haue, within there: reach our shields, When beauty fights, the God of battaile yeelds. Exeunt. Enter Francisco, Hippolito, Flamineo, Iulio. Enter Anthonio, Aspero, Florimell, two Pages Lords and Messenger aboue. Flo. They offer parlee, let mee answer them. Brothers, how now? who made you souldiers? Faith een my father as he made you louers: What? hath he chang'd your shepheards hooks to swords? Of Amoradoes made you armed knights? O seld-seene metamorphosis! J haue knowne Souldiers turne louers, but for amorous louers To re-assume their valour, tis a change, Like winter-thunder, and a thing as strange. Fr. Our sister prisoner? Hip. Tell me Florimell, Dost thou liue there enforc'd, or of free-will? Flo. Free will, brothers, mine owne freewill, all free in Mantua, here's freewill yfaith, speake am J not a free-woman? Pa. As if you had seru'd for't, any man may set vp vnder hir copy without a protection. Fr. J wag? are you there too? Pa. Yes faith my Lord, my Lady has had my attendaunce to a hayre. Flo. You lie boy. Pa. If not mine, some bodies els: there's one has doneâ Asp. What haue I done sirra? Pa. Nay nothing, but what my Lady was very well content with. Fr. VVhy sister, shame you not to set your loue On one, that is our Fathers enemie. Flo. Shame? not a whit: but come, your wenches brothers, I make no question, I haue won my wager: Are they as faire as I? Hip. Leaue that to triall. Aspero make surrender of our sister. Asp. And haue her in quiet possession? what do you thinke me. Fr. We thinke thee a proud villain and our foe. Flo. By heauen, th'are villains all that thinke him so. Hip. Why doe you loue him. Flo. I should curse my selfe if I should hate him: Fr. Bring the ladders forth, Brauely assault to separate their liues. As they are scaling the walls, the Ladies come forth. Her. Stand proud Francisco. Pa. Sand! O excellent word in a woman! Luc. Hold Hippolito. Pa. Hold! vp with that word, and tis as good as the other. Fr. VVhat nymphe or goddesse in my Hermiaes shape, Stands to debar my entrance to the towne? Pa. Madam, I wonder they enter not. Flo. Why boy it seemes they dare not. Pa. O cowards and haue two such fayre breaches already. Fr. Immortall Pallas that art more diuine, In my loues beautie that thou cloth'st thee in, Withdrawe thy selfe, and giue our fury limits. Her. I will, but first Francisco take my shielde. Luc. And mine as challenge to a single combat, Her. Read the conditions and returne your answers. Flo. VVell done yfaith wenches, O that the olde gray-beard my Father were here, ide haue about with him as I am honourable. Fr. VVhats here! A shepheard wooing of a Countrymaide, As she sits angling by a Riuers side, By them an aged man making a net! The Motto: Sic! this Emblems morrall is, The former loue I had with Lucida, And this hope tells me that's faire. Lucida. Hip. Brother, my shield the like presents to me, But holds far more familiar reference, Here doth the amorous shepheard kisse the Nymph; Which she with a chast blush consents vnto: And see, a gloomy man, clad like a pilgrim Comes in, and seperates their sweete delights: The Motto, Sic! I so my Father came, and banisht me from beautious Hermia, and this hope tells me is faire Hermia. Fr. The more I looke, the more me thinkes tis she. Hip. The more I think the more I find tis she. Fr. VVhat should I thinke to proue it is not she? Flo. Looke, thinke, find, proue, doe what you can, These are the wenches that you courted than: Then hony bees lay by your smarting stings, and buz sweet loue into your Ladies eares, Tell them of kisses, and such prety things, These drumming dub adubs loues pleasure feares. Fr. O heauen, oh fortune, and most happie stars, Do I find loue, where I expected wars? Hip. I that but now was all for war and death, am made all loue, wars humour's out of breath. Enter Octauio, Iulio, and others. Oct. How, my sonnes loue the daughters of my foe! it cannot be. Iul. Then question them your selfe. Oct. VVhy how now sonnes, is this your worth in armes. Fr. VVhy are we not in armes father. Hip. Yes, and in such armes as no Coward, but woulde venture life to march in. Oct. Then boies, you loue the daughters of Anthonio. Fr. VVe lik'd them first. Hip. VVel keepe than liking stilt. Oct. And you will loue them. Flo. Father in faith they will. Oct. I, runaway? are you there? whome hac your Ladyship got to your husband? Flo. One that I stumbled on at Blindman buffe, a proper man, a man euery ynch of him: and you would say so, and you knewe but asmuch as Iâmeane to know ere I haue done with him. Oct. Is he not sonne vnto Anthonio? Asp. Great Duke I am, and prostrate on my knee, I beg a peace, which if your spleene deny, I proudlie stand where erst I mildly kneel'd, and cast downe bold defiance from theis walls. Oct. No more: your loues make my proud hart asham'd, Your consort's sweet, and ile not be a meane To make it iar: what my sonnes like shall stand, By my consent, allowed and perfected; all hate is banisht, and reuenge lies dead. Asp. Then stead of speares, let Hymens torches flame VVith hallowed incence, and the God of spright, Swell vp your vaines with amorous delight: and so shut vp our single Comedy, VVith Plautus phrase: Si places, plaudite. Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
