      <field name="fulltext">TO JAMES THOMAS O'BRIEN, D.D. FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED, BY JOHN ANSTER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. Again, fair images, ye flutter near, As erst ye shone to cheer the mourner's eye, And may I hope that ye will linger here? Will my heart leap as in the days gone by? Ye throng before my view, divinely clear, Like sunbeams conquering a cloudy sky! Beneath your lightning-glance my spirit burns, Magic is breathing—youth and joy returns! What forms rise beautiful of happy years? What lovely shadows float before me fast? Like an old song still tingling in the ears, I hear the voice of loves and friendships past;— Renewed each sorrow, and each joy appears, That marked life's changing labyrinthine waste; The friends return, who passed in youth away, Cheated, alas! of half life's little day But, ah! they cannot hear my closing song, Those hearts, for whom my earliest lays were tried: Departed is, alas! the friendly throng, And dumb the echoing spirits that replied; If some still live this stranger world among, Fortune hath scattered them at distance wide, To men unknown my griefs must I impart, Whose very praise is sorrow to the heart! Again it comes! a long unwonted feeling, A wish for that calm solemn phantom-land My song is swelling now, now lowly stealing, Like Æol's harp, by varying breezes fanned, Tears follow tears, my weaknesses revealing, And silent shudders show a heart unmanned, —Dull forms of daily life before me flee, The PAST—the PAST alone, seems true to me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRELUDE AT THE THEATRE. MANAGER. DRAMATIC POET. MR. MERRYMAN. Manager. My two good friends, on whom I have depended, At all times to assist me and advise; Aid your old friend once more—to-night he tries, (And greatly fears the fate that may attend it) For Germany a novel enterprise, To please the public I am most desirous; Live and let live, has ever been their maxim, Gladly they pay the trifle that we tax 'em, And gratitude should with new zeal inspire us. Our temporary theatre 's erected, Planks laid, posts raised, and something is expected. Already have the audience ta'en their station, With eye-brows lifted up in expectation; They come with bounding spirits—hearts excited, Determined to be charmed—amazed—delighted! I know the people's taste—their whims—caprices, Could always get up popular new pieces; But never have I been before so harassed As now—so thoroughly perplext, embarrassed! Every one reads so much of every thing: The books they read are not the best, 'tis true: But then they are for ever reading—reading! This being so, how can we hope to bring Any thing out, that shall be good and new? What chance of now as formerly succeeding? How I delight to see the people striving To force their way into our crowded booth, Pouring along, and fighting, nail and tooth, Digging with elbows, through the passage driving, As if it were St. Peter's gate, and leading To something more desirable than Eden; Long before FOUR, while daylight's strong as ever, All hurrying to the box of the receiver, Breaking their necks for tickets—thrusting—jamming, As at a baker's door in time of famine! On men so various in their disposition, So different in manners—rank—condition; How is a miracle like this effected? The poet—he alone is the magician. On thee, my friend, we call—from thee expect it. Poet. Oh, tell me not of the tumultuous crowd, My powers desert me in the noisy throng; Hide, hide me from the multitude, whose loud And dizzy whirl would hurry me along Against my will; and lead me to some lone And silent vale—some scene in fairy-land, There only will the poet's heart expand, Surrendered to the impulses of song, Lost in delicious visions of its own, Where Love and Friendship o'er the heart at rest Watch through the flowing hours, and we are blest! Thoughts by the soul conceived in silent joy, Sounds often muttered by the timid voice, Tried by the nice ear, delicate of choice, Till we at last are pleased, or self-deceived, The whole a rabble's madness may destroy; And this, when, after toil of many years, Touched and retouched, the perfect piece appears, To challenge praise, or win unconscious tears, As the vain heart too easily believed; Some sparkling, showy thing, got up in haste, Brilliant and light, will catch the passing taste. The truly great, the genuine, the sublime Wins its slow way in silence; and the bard, Unnoticed long, receives from after-time The imperishable wreath, his best, his sole reward! Mr. Merryman. Enough of this cold cant of future ages, And men hereafter doting on your pages; To prattle thus of other times is pleasant, And all the while neglect our own, the PRESENT. If on the unborn we squander our exertion, Who will supply the living with diversion? And, clamour as you authors may about it, We want amusement, will not go without it; A fashionable group is no small matter, Methinks, a poet's vanity to flatter: He who, profusely lavishing invention, Pleases himself, need feel no apprehension; The crowd soon share the feelings of the poet, The praise he seeks they liberally bestow it: The more that come, the better for the writer; Each flash of wit is farther felt—seems brighter, And every little point appreciated, By some one in the circle over-rated, All is above its value estimated: Take courage then,—come—now for a chef-d'œuvre— To make a name—to live, and live for ever— Call Fancy up, with her attendant troop, Reason and Judgment, Passion, Melancholy, Wit, Feeling, and be sure among the group Not to forget the little darling, Folly! Manager. But above all, give them enough of action; He who gives most, will give most satisfaction; They come to see a show—no work whatever, Unless it be a show, can win their favour; Therefore, by this their taste, be thou admonished, Weave brilliant scenes to captivate their eyes: Let them but stare and gape, and be astonished, Soon as a dramatist your fame will rise. A show is what they want; they love and pay for it; Spite of its serious parts, sit through a play for it; And he who gives one is a certain favourite; Would you please many, you must give good measure; Then each finds something in 't to yield him pleasure; The more you give, the greater sure your chance is To please, by varying scenes, such various fancies. The interest of a piece, no doubt, increases Divided thus, and broken into pieces. Such a ragoût is soon prepared, nor shall it Be otherwise than pleasing to each palate; And, for my part, methinks it little matters: Though you may call your work a finished whole, The public soon will tear this whole to tatters, And but on piecemeal parts their praises dole. Poet. You cannot think how very mean a task, How humbling to a genuine artist's mind, To furnish such a drama as you ask: The poor pretender's bungling tricks, I find, Are now established as the rules of trade,— Receipts—by which successful plays are made! Manager. Such an objection is of little weight Against my reasoning. If a person chooses To work effectively, no doubt he uses The instrument that 's most appropriate. Your play may—for your audience—be too good;— Coarse lumpish logs are they of clumsy wood— Blocks—with the hatchet only to be hewed!— One comes to drive away ennui or spleen; Another, with o'erloaded paunch from table; A third, than all the rest less tolerable, From reading a review or magazine. Hither all haste, anticipate delight, As to a Masque, desire each face illuming, And each, some novel character assuming, Place for awhile their own half out of sight. The ladies, too, tricked out in brilliant gear, Themselves ambitious actresses appear, And, though unpaid, are still performers here. What do you dream, in your poetic pride? Think you a full house can be satisfied And every auditor an ardent cheerer? Pray, only look at them a little nearer; One half are cold spectators, inattentive; The other dead to every fine incentive; One fellow's thinking of a game of cards; One on a wild night of intoxication: Why court for such a set the kind regards Of the coy Muse—her highest fascination? I tell thee only, give enough—enough; Still more and more—no matter of what stuff, You cannot go astray; let all your views Be only for the moment to amuse, To keep them in amazement or distraction; Man is incapable of satisfaction. Why, what affects you thus—is 't inspiration? A reverie?—oh! can it be vexation? Poet. Go, and elsewhere some fitter servant find; What! shall the poet squander then away, And spend in worthless, worse than idle, play, The highest gift that ever nature gave, The inalienable birthright of mankind, The freedom of the independent mind, And sink into an humble trading slave? Whence is his power all human hearts to win, And why can nothing his proud march oppose, As through all elements the conqueror goes? Oh! is it not the harmony within, The music which hath for its dwelling-place His own rich soul—the heart that can receive And hold in its unlimited embrace All things inanimate, and all that live? When Nature, like a tired and stupid sloven, Twists with dull fingers the coarse threads of life, When all things, that, together interwoven, In happy concord still agreeing, Should join to form the web of being, Are tangled in inextricable strife; Who then can cheer life's drear monotony, Bestow upon the dead new animation, Restore the dissonant to harmony, And bid the jarring individual be A chord, that, in the general consecration, Bears part with all in musical relation? Who to the tempest's rage can give a voice Like human passion? bid the serious mind Glow with the colouring of the sunset hours? Who in the dear path scatter spring's first flowers, When wanders forth the ladye of his choice? Who of the valueless green leaves can bind A wreath—the artist's proudest ornament— Or, round the conquering hero's brow entwined The best reward his country can present? Whose voice is fame? who gives us to inherit Olympus, and the loved Elysian field? The soul of MAN sublimed—man's soaring spirit Seen in the POET, gloriously revealed. Friend. A poet then should regulate his fancies, Like that of life should get up his romances; First a chance meeting—then the young folk tarry Together—toy and trifle, sigh and marry, Are link'd for ever, scarcely half intending it, Once met—'tis fixed—no changing and no mending it. Thus a romance runs: fortune, then reverses; Rapture, then coldness; bridal dresses—hearses; The lady dying—letters from the lover, And, ere you think of it, the thing is over. Adopt this principle; write fast and gaily, Give, in your play, the life we witness daily; The life which all men live, yet few men notice, Yet which will please ('tis very strange, but so 'tis), Will please, when forced again on their attention More than the wonders of remote invention; Shift your scenes rapidly—and in the mirror You hold up to the age show its own error— Glimmerings of truth—calm sentiment—smart strictures— Actors in bustle—clouds of moving pictures— Such pantomime is sure to be regarded; The public pleased, the dramatist rewarded: This will attract the tender and the feeling; The young, whose minds are yet unformed and plastic Will crowd to you with love enthusiastic, Hang rapturously o'er a work, revealing Their own hearts to themselves, in solitude Will feast on the remembered visions—stealing From them their sweet and melancholy food: Still the true charm, by which they are affected Is this,—each sees his secret heart reflected: Ready alike to weep or smile are they, Admire the bard, adore his fancy's play; Float with him on imagination's wing, Think all his thoughts, are his in every thing, Are, while they dream not of it, all they see: Youth—youth is the true time for sympathy. Hope little from the formal and the old; Frozen with vanity, they must be cold; Their sympathies are day by day diminished, Till nothing can be made of men so finished; Why they know every thing, all perfect they, What could they learn from poet or from play? With them all progress long ago is ended; Try any novelty, they are offended: Self is the secret; to enlarge their range Of thought, were seeking in themselves a change: Your true admirer is the generous spirit, Unformed, unspoiled, he feels all kindred merit As if of his own being it were part, And growing with the growth of his own heart; Feels gratitude, because he feels that truth Is taught him by the poet—this is Youth; Nothing can please your grown ones, they're so knowing, And no one thanks the poet but the growing. Poet. Give me, oh! give me back the days When I—I too—was young— And felt, as they now feel, each coming hour New consciousness of power. Oh happy, happy time, above all praise! Then thoughts on thoughts and crowding fancies sprung, And found a language in unbidden lays; Unintermitted streams from fountains ever flowing. Then, as I wander'd free, In every field, for me Its thousand flowers were blowing! A veil through which I did not see, A thin veil o'er the world was thrown In every bud a mystery; Magic in every thing unknown:— The fields, the grove, the air was haunted, And all that age has disenchanted. Yes! give me—give me back the days of youth, Poor, yet how rich!—my glad inheritance The inextinguishable love of truth, While life's realities were all romance— Give me, oh! give youth's passions unconfined, The rush of joy that felt almost like pain, Its hate, its love, its own tumultuous mind;— Give me my youth again! Friend. Why, my good friend, for youth thus sigh and prattle, I own 'twould be a fine thing in a battle; If a young beauty on your arm were leaning, Then, I admit, the wish would have some meaning; In running, for a wager, a long distance, A young man's sinews would be some assistance; Or if, after a dance, a man was thinking Of reeling out the night in glorious drinking; But you have only among chords, well known Of the familiar harp, with graceful finger Freely to stray at large, or fondly linger, Courting some wandering fancies of your own; While, with capricious windings and delays, Loitering, or lost in an enchanted maze Of sweet sounds, the rich melody, at will Gliding, here rests, here indolently strays, Is ever free, yet evermore obeys The hidden guide, that journeys with it still. This is, old gentleman, your occupation, Nor think that it makes less our veneration. “Age,” says the song, “the faculties bewildering, Renders men childish”—no! it finds them children. Manager. Come, come, no more of this absurd inventory Of flattering phrases—courteous—complimentary. You both lose time in words unnecessary, Playing with language thus at fetch and carry; Think not of tuning now or preparation, Strike up, my boy—no fear—no hesitation, Till you commence no chance of inspiration. But once assume the poet—then the fire From heaven will come to kindle and inspire. Strong drink is what we want to gull the people, A hearty, brisk, and animating tipple; Come, come, no more delay, no more excuses, The stuff we ask you for, at once produce us. Lose this day loitering—'twill be the same story To-morrow—and the next more dilatory; Then indecision brings its own delays, And days are lost lamenting o'er lost days. Are you in earnest? seize this very minute— What you can do, or dream you can, begin it, Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Only engage, and then the mind grows heated— Begin it, and the work will be completed! You know our German bards, like bold adventurers, Bring out whate'er they please, and laugh at censurers, Then do not think to-day of sparing scenery— Command enough of dresses and machinery; Use as you please—fire, water, thunder, levin— The greater and the lesser lights of heaven. Squander away the stars at your free pleasure, And build up rocks and mountains without measure. Of birds and beasts we've plenty here to lavish, Come, cast away all apprehensions slavish— Strut, on our narrow stage, with lofty stature, As moving through the circle of wide nature, Hurry with speed more swift than words can tell, Rapid as thought—from HEAVEN—through EARTH—to HELL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN. DER HERR, THE HEAVENLY HOSTS, afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES. The three Archangels come forward. Raphael. The sun, as in the ancient days, 'Mong sister stars in rival song, His destined path observes, obeys, And still in thunder rolls along: New strength and full beatitude The angels gather from his sight, Mysterious all—yet all is good, All fair as at the birth of light! Gabriel. Swift, unimaginably swift, Soft spins the earth, and glories bright Of mid-day Eden change and shift To shades of deep and spectral night. The vexed sea foams—waves leap and moan, And chide the rocks with insult hoarse, And wave and rock are hurried on, And suns and stars in endless course. Michael. And winds with winds mad war maintain, From sea to land, from land to sea; And heave round earth, a living chain Of interwoven agency. Guides of the bursting thunder-peal, Fast lightnings flash with deadly ray, While, Lord, with Thee thy servants feel Calm effluence of abiding day. All. New strength and full beatitude The angels gather from thy sight; Mysterious all, yet all is good, All fair as at the birth of light. Mephistopheles. Since Thou, O Lord, dost visit us once more, To ask how things are going on, and since You have received me kindly heretofore, I venture to the levee of my prince. Pardon me, if I fail, after the sort Of bending courtiers here, to pay my court; The company is far too fine for me, They smile with scorn such folk in heaven to see. High hymns and solemn words are not my forte. Pathos from me would look too like a joke; Words, that from others had set angels weeping, To laughter would your very self provoke, If laughter were not wholly out of keeping. Nothing of suns or worlds have I to say, I only see how men fret on their day; The little god of earth is still the same Strange thing he was, when first to life he came; That life were somewhat better, if the light Of Heaven had not been given to spoil him quite. Reason he calls it—see its blessed fruit, Than the brute beast man is a beastlier brute; He seems to me, if I may venture on Such a comparison, to be like one Of those long lank-legged grashoppers, whose song The self-same creak, chirps, as they bound along, Monotonous and restless in the grass, 'Twere well 'twas in grass always; but, alas, They thrust their snouts in every filth they pass. Der Herr. Hast thou no more than this to say, Thou, who complainest every day? Are all things evil in thy sight? Does nothing on the earth move right? Mephistopheles. Not any thing, my lord—poor men so fervent And foolish are—I almost feel compassion. Der Herr. Dost thou know Faust? Mephistopheles. The doctor? Der Herr. Yes: my servant. Mephistopheles. Truly, he serves in a peculiar fashion; Child though he be of human birth, His food and drink are not of earth. Foolish—even he at times will feel The folly in such hopes to deal:— His fancies hurry him afar; Of heaven he asks its highest star; Self-willed and spoiled, in mad pursuit, Of earth demands its fairest fruit; And all that both can give supplied, Behold him still unsatisfied! Der Herr. Yes: for he serves in a perplexing scene, That oft misleads him. Still his WILL is right; Soon comes the time to lead him into light. Now is the first prophetic green, The hopes and promises of spring, The unformed bud and blossoming; And he who reared the tree and knows the clime Will seek and find fair fruit in fitting time. Mephistopheles. What will you wager you don't lose him yet, With all his promise? Had I only freedom On my own path with easy lure to lead him, I've not a doubt of it I win the bet. Der Herr. As long as on the earth endures his life To deal with him have full and free permission; Man's hour on earth is weakness, error, strife. Mephistopheles. Cheerfully I agree to the condition; I have no fancy for the dead: your youth, With full fresh cheeks, tastes daintier to my tooth. Should a corpse call, the answer at my house Is, “Not at home.” Cats like a tender mouse. Der Herr. Be it permitted: from his source divert And draw this Spirit captive down with thee; Till baffled and in shame thou dost admit, “A good man, clouded though his senses be By error, is no willing slave to it.” His consciousness of good will it desert The good man?—yea, even in his darkest hours Still doth he war with Darkness and the Powers Of Darkness;—for the light he cannot see Still round him feels;—and, if he be not free, Struggles against this strange captivity. Mephistopheles. Well, this can neither make me fear nor fret; I cannot have a doubt about the bet. Oh! in what triumph shall I crow at winning! Dust he shall eat, and eat with pleasure yet, Like that first SNAKE in my poor heraldry, Who has been eating it from the beginning. Der Herr. Still visit here. With any thing but loathing I look on folk like you. My work demands Such servants. Of the Spirits of Denial The pleasantest, that figures in Man's Trial, Is old Iniquity In the original “Der Schalk” the droll of the old mysteries and moralities. “The formal Vice Iniquity.”—Richard the Third. “—the old Vice, Who, with dagger of lath, In his rage and his wrath, Cries ah! ha! to the Devil.”—Twelfth Night. The characters of the Devil and the Vice which were originally distinct became in the progress of the dramatic art soon blended into one. “The province of making the spectators merry descended from the Devil in the mystery to the Vice or Iniquity of the Morality, who originally personified some bad quality incident to human nature, as Pride, Lust, &amp;c.”—Strutt. “Some traces of this antiquated exhibition are still retained in the rustic puppet-plays, in which I have seen the Devil very lustily belaboured by Punch, whom I hold to be the legitimate successor of the old Vice.”—Johnson. The best account I know of the word “Der Schalk” is in Koller's Faust Papers. in his Fool's clothing; The Vice is never heavy upon hands: Without the Knave the Mystery were nothing. For Man's activity soon tires, (A lazy being at the best) And sting and spur requires. In indolent enjoyment Man would live, And this companion, whom I therefore give, Goads, urges, drives—is devil, and cannot rest. But ye, true sons of God, be yours the sight Of living Beauty and Eternal Light! The Universal Soul, in which all move, And live, and are, encompass you in love; And all that flows unfixed and undefined In glimmering phantasy before the mind, Bid Thought's enduring chain for ever bind! [Heaven closes. Mephistopheles (alone). I'm very glad to have it in my power To see him now and then; he is so civil: I rather like our good old governor— Think only of his speaking to the devil!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Time, Night. Scene, A high-arched, narrow, Gothic chamber— Faustus at his desk—restless. Faustus. Alas! I have explored Philosophy, and Law, and Medicine; And over deep Divinity have pored, Studying with ardent and laborious zeal; And here I am at last, a very fool, With useless learning curst, No wiser than at first! Here am I—boast and wonder of the school; Magister, Doctor, and I lead These ten years past, my pupils' creed; Winding, by dexterous words, with ease, Their opinions as I please. And now to feel that nothing can be known! This is a thought that burns into my heart. I have been more acute than all these triflers, Doctors and authors, priests, philosophers; Have sounded all the depths of every science. Scruples, or the perplexity of doubt, Torment me not, nor fears of hell or devil; But I have lost all peace of mind: Whate'er I knew, or thought I knew, Seems now unmeaning or untrue. Unhappy, ignorant, and blind, I cannot hope to teach mankind. Thus robbed of learning's only pleasure, Without dominion, rank, or treasure, Without one joy that earth can give, Could dog—were I a dog—so live? Therefore to magic, with severe And patient toil, have I applied, Despairing of all other guide, That from some Spirit I might hear Deep truths, to others unrevealed, And mysteries from mankind sealed; And never more, with shame of heart, Teach things, of which I know no part. Oh, for a glance into the earth! To see below its dark foundations, Life's embryo seeds before their birth And Nature's silent operations. Thus end at once this vexing fever Of words—mere words—repeated ever. Beautiful Moon!—Ah! would that now, For the last time, thy lovely beams Shone on my troubled brow! Oft by this desk, at middle night, I have sat gazing for thy light, Wearied with search, through volumes endless, I sate 'mong papers—crowded books, Alone—when thou, friend of the friendless, Camest smiling in, with soothing looks. Oh, that upon some headland height I now were wandering in thy light! Floating with Spirits, like a shadow, Round mountain-cave, o'er twilight meadow; And from the toil of thought relieved, No longer sickened and deceived, In thy soft dew could bathe, and find Tranquillity and health of mind. Alas! and am I in the gloom Still of this cursed dungeon room? Where even heaven's light, so beautiful, Through the stained glass comes thick and dull; 'Mong volumes heaped from floor to ceiling, Through whose pages worms are stealing; Dreary walls, where dusty paper Bears deep stains of smoky vapour; Glasses, instruments, all lumber Of this kind the place encumber; All a man of learning gathers, All bequeathed me by my fathers, Crucibles from years undated, Chairs of structure antiquated, Are in strange confusion hurled! Here, Faustus, is thy world—a world! And dost thou ask, why in thy breast The fearful heart is not at rest? Why painful feelings, undefined, With icy pressure cramp thy mind? From living nature thou hast fled To dwell 'mong fragments of the dead; And for the lovely scenes which Heaven Hath made man for, to man hath given; Hast chosen to pore o'er mouldering bones Of brute and human skeletons! Away—away and far away! This book, where secret spells are scanned, Traced by Nostradam's own hand, Will be thy strength and stay: The courses of the stars to thee No longer are a mystery; The thoughts of Nature thou canst seek, As Spirits with their brothers speak. It is, it is the sunrise hour Of thy own being; light, and power, And fervour to the soul are given, As proudly it ascends its heaven. To ponder here, o'er spells and signs, Symbolic letters, circles, lines; And from their actual use refrain, Were time and labour lost in vain: Then ye, whom I feel floating near me, Spirits, answer, ye who hear me! [He opens the book, and lights upon the sign of Macrocosmus. Ha! what new life divine, intense, Floods in a moment every sense; I feel the dawn of youth again, Visiting each glowing vein! Was it a god who wrote this sign? The tumults of my soul are stilled, My withered heart with rapture filled: In virtue of the spell divine, The secret powers that nature mould, Their essence and their acts unfold— Am I a god?—Can mortal sight Enjoy, endure this burst of light? How clear these silent characters! All Nature present to my view, And each creative act of hers— And is the glorious vision true? The wise man's words at length are plain, Whose sense so long I sought in vain: “The Worlde of Spirits no Clouds conceale: “Man's Eye is dim, it cannot see. “Man's Heart is dead, it cannot feele. “Thou, who wouldst knowe the Things that be, “Bathe thy Heart in the Sunrise red, “Till its Stains of earthlie drosse are fled.” [He looks over the sign attentively. Oh! how the spell before my sight Brings nature's hidden ways to light: See! all things with each other blending— Each to all its being lending— All on each in turn depending— Heavenly ministers descending— And again to heaven up-tending— Floating, mingling, interweaving— Rising, sinking, and receiving Each from each, while each is giving On to each, and each relieving Each, the pails of gold, the living Current through the air is heaving; Breathing blessings, see them bending, Balanced worlds from change defending, While every where diffused is harmony unending! Oh! what a vision—but a vision only! Can heart of man embrace Illimitable Nature? Fountain of life, forth-welling; The same in every place; That dost support and cheer Wide heaven, and teeming earth, and every creature That hath therein its dwelling, Oh! could the blighted soul but feel thee near! To thee still turns the withered heart; To thee the spirit, seared and lonely, Childlike, would seek the sweet restorative; On thy maternal bosom feed and live. I ask a solace thou dost not impart; The food I hunger for thou dost not give! [He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, till his eye rests on the sign of the Spirit of the Earth. How differently this sign affects my frame! Spirit of Earth! my nature is the same, Or near akin to thine! How fearlessly I read this sign! And feel even now new powers are mine; While my brain burns, as though with wine; Give me the agitated strife, The madness of the world of life; I feel within my soul the birth Of strength, enabling me to bear, And thoughts, impelling me to share The fortunes, good or evil, of the earth; To battle with the tempest's breath, Or plunge where Shipwreck grinds his teeth. All around grows cold and cloudy, The moon withdraws her ray; The lamp's loose flame is shivering, It fades, it dies away. Ha! round my brow what sparkles ruddy In trembling light are quivering? And, to and fro, Stream sheets of flame, in fearful play, Rolled and unrolled, In crimson fold, They float and flow! From the vaulted space above, A shuddering horror seems to move Down,—down upon me creeps and seizes The life's blood, in its grasp that freezes; 'Tis thou—I feel thee, Spirit, near, Thou hast heard the spell, and thou Art hovering around me now; Spirit! to my sight appear, How my heart is torn in sunder— All my thoughts convulsed with wonder— Every faculty and feeling Strained to welcome thy revealing. Spirit, my heart, my heart is given to thee, Though death may be the price, I cannot choose but see! [He grasps the book, and pronounces the sign of the Spirit mysteriously; a red flame is seen playing about, and in the flame the Spirit. Spirit. Who calls me? Faustus (averting his face). Form of horror, hence! Spirit. Hither from my distant sphere, Thou hast compelled me to appear; Hast sucked me down, and dragged me thence, With importuning violence; And now— Faustus. I shudder, overpowered with fear Spirit. With what anxiety of mind Didst thou demand to gaze on me, My voice to hear, my form to see? Thy longings, earnest and intense, Have reached my sphere, and wrung me thence! And now—what pitiful despair Hath seized thee—thee, thou more than man?— Where is the courage that could dare To call on fleshless spirits?—where The soul, that could conceive and plan, Yea, and create its world;—whose pride The bounds, which limit man, defied— Heaved with high sense of inborn powers, Nor feared to mete its strength with ours? Where art thou, Faustus? thou whose voice I heard, Whose mighty spirit pressed itself to mine! Art thou the same, whose senses thus are shattered, Whose very being in my breath is scattered, Whose soul, into itself retreating, Vain worm! can scarce endure the fearful meeting?— Is this, indeed, the miserable sequel? Faustus. Creature of flame, shall I grow pale before thee? 'Twas I that called thee—Faustus—I, thine equal! Spirit. In the currents of life, in the tempests of motion, Hither and thither Over and under, Wend I and wander— Birth and the grave— A limitless ocean, Where the restless wave Undulates ever— Under and over Their toiling strife, I mingle and hover, The spirit of life: Hear the murmuring wheel of time, unawed, As I weave the living mantle of God! Faustus. Spirit, whose presence circles the wide earth, How near akin to thine I feel my nature! Spirit. Man, thou art like those beings which thy mind Can image, not like me! [Vanishes. Faustus (overpowered with confusion). Not like thee! Formed in the image of the Deity, And yet unmeet to be compared with thee! [A knock. 'S death, 'tis this pupil lad of mine— He comes my airy guests to banish. This elevating converse dread, These visions, dazzlingly outspread Before my senses, all will vanish At the formal fellow's tread! [Enter Wagner in his dressing-gown and night-cap —a lamp in his hand. Faustus turns round, displeased. Wagner. Forgive me, but I thought you were declaiming. You have been reciting some Greek play, no doubt; I wish to improve myself in this same art; 'Tis a most useful one. I've heard it said, An actor might give lessons to a parson. Faustus. Yes! when your parson is himself an actor; A circumstance which very often happens! Wagner. Oh! if a man shuts himself up for ever In his dull study; if he sees the world Never, unless on some chance holyday, Looks at it from a distance, through a telescope, How can he learn to sway the minds of men By eloquence? to rule them, or persuade? Faustus. If feeling does not prompt, in vain you strive; If from the soul the language does not come, By its own impulse, to impel the hearts Of hearers, with communicated power, In vain you strive—in vain you study earnestly. Toil on for ever; piece together fragments; Cook up your broken scraps of sentences, And blow, with puffing breath, a struggling light, Glimmering confusedly now, now cold in ashes; Startle the school-boys with your metaphors; And, if such food may suit your appetite, Win the vain wonder of applauding children! But never hope to stir the hearts of men, And mould the souls of many into one, By words which come not native from the heart! Wagner. Expression, graceful utterance, is the first And best acquirement of the orator. This do I feel, and feel my want of it! Faustus. Dost thou seek genuine and worthy fame? Not as our town declaimers use, delighted, Like a brute beast, with chimes of jingling bells; Reason and honest feeling want no arts Of utterance—ask no toil of elocution; And when you speak in earnest, do you need A search for words? Oh! these fine holyday phrases, In which you robe your worn-out common-places, These scraps of paper which you crimp and curl, And twist into a thousand idle shapes, These filigree ornaments are good for nothing, Cost time and pains, please few, impose on no one; Are unrefreshing, as the wind that whistles, In autumn, 'mong the dry and wrinkled leaves. Wagner. The search of knowledge is a weary one, And life how short! Ars longa, Vita brevis! How often have the heart and brain, o'er-tasked, Shrunk back despairing from enquiries vain! Oh! with what difficulty are the means Acquired, that lead us to the springs of knowledge! And when the path is found, ere we have trod Half the long way—poor wretches! we must die! Faustus. Are mouldy records, then, the holy springs, Whose healing waters still the thirst within? Oh! never yet hath mortal drunk A draught restorative, That welled not from the depths of his own soul! Wagner. Pardon me—but you will at least confess That 'tis delightful to transfuse yourself Into the spirit of the ages past; To see how wise men thought in olden time, And how far we outstep their march in knowledge. Faustus. Oh yes! as far as from the earth to heaven! To us, my friend, the times that are gone by Are a mysterious book, sealed with seven seals: That which you call the spirit of ages past Is but, in truth, the spirit of some few authors In which those ages are beheld reflected, With what distortion strange heaven only knows. Oh! often, what a toilsome thing it is This study of thine, at the first glance we fly it. A mass of things confusedly heaped together; A lumber-room of dusty documents, Furnished with all approved court-precedents, And old traditional maxims! History! Facts dramatised say rather—action—plot— Sentiment, every thing the writer's own, As it best fits the web-work of his story, With here and there a solitary fact Of consequence, by those grave chroniclers, Pointed with many a moral apophthegm, And wise old saws, learned at the puppet-shows. Wagner. But then the world, man's heart and mind, are things Of which 'twere well that each man had some knowledge. Faustus. Why yes!—they call it knowledge. Who may dare To name things by their real names? The few Who did know something, and were weak enough To expose their hearts unguarded—to expose Their views and feelings to the eyes of men, They have been nailed to crosses—thrown to flames. Pardon me; but 'tis very late, my friend; Too late to hold this conversation longer. Wagner. How willingly would I sit up for ever, Gathering instruction from your learned words! To-morrow, as a boon on Easter-day, You must permit me a few questions more: I have been diligent in all my studies; Given my whole heart and time to the pursuit; And I know much, but would learn every thing. [Exit. Faustus (alone). How hope abandons not the meanest mind! Poor lad! he clings to learning's poorest forms, Delves eagerly for fancied gold to find Worms—dust; is happy among dust and worms! And did human accents dare To disturb the midnight air With their mean and worthless sound, Here, where Spirits breathed around? Yet, dull intruder as thou art, I thank thee from my very heart. When my senses sank beneath Despair, and sought relief in death; When life within me dying shivered, Thy presence from the trance delivered. Oh, while I stood before that giant stature, How dwarfed I felt beneath its nobler nature! Image of God! I thought that I had been Sublimed from earth, no more a child of clay, That, shining gloriously with Heaven's own day, I had beheld Truth's countenance serene. High above cherubs—above all that serve, Raised up immeasurably—every nerve Of Nature's life seemed animate with mine; Her very veins with blood from my veins filled— Her spirit moving as my spirit willed; Then did I in creations of my own (Oh, is not man in every thing divine!) Build worlds—or bidding them no longer be— Exert, enjoy a sense of deity— Doomed for such dreams presumptuous to atone; All by one word of thunder overthrown! Spirit, I may not mete myself with thee! True, I compelled thee to appear, But had no power to hold thee here. Oh! at that glorious moment how I felt— How little and how great! Thy presence flung me shuddering back Into man's abject state; That inexplicable trance Of utter, hopeless ignorance! Who now shall teach me? what shall I avoid? Shall I resist this impulse, or obey? What is this life of ours? alike destroyed By what we do or suffer!—will the day Come never, when it is to be enjoyed? Whate'er of noblest and of best Man's soul can reach, is clogged and prest By low considerations that adhere Inseparably. Oh! when we obtain The goods of this world, soon do we restrain Our loftier aspirations; and we call Man's better riches a delusion vain, The mockery of an empty vision all! The lordly feelings given us at our birth Are numbed—our true life dies—'mong the low cares of earth. How boldly, in the days of youthful Hope, Imagination spreads her wing unchecked! Deeming all things within her ample scope; And oh, how small a space suffices her, When Fortune flees away, vain flatterer, And all we loved in life's strange whirl is wrecked! Deep in the breast Care builds her nest, And ever-torturing scares all rest: Each day assumes some new disguise, With some new art the temper tries, Fretting the mind with house affairs, Suggesting doubts of wife or heirs, Hinting dark fancies to the soul, Of fire and flood—of dirk and bowl. Man trembles thus each hour at fancied crosses, And weeps for ever at ideal losses. Am not I like the gods?—Alas! I tremble, Feeling imprest upon my soul the thought Of the mean worm, whose nature I resemble. 'Tis dust, and lives in dust, and the chance tread Crushes the wretched reptile into nought. Is this not dust in which I live? This prison-place, what can it give Of life or comfort? wheresoe'er The sick eye turns, it sees one tier— Along the blank high wall—of shelves And gloomy volumes, which themselves Are dust and lumber; and the scrolls That crowd the hundred pigeon-holes And crevices of that old case— That darkens and confines the space Already but too small—'mong these What can life be but a disease? Here housed in dust, with grub and moth, I sicken—mind and body both. —Shall I find here the cure I ask, Resume the edifying task Of reading, in a thousand pages, That care-worn man has, in all ages, Sowed Vanity to reap Despair? That one, mayhap, has here and there Been less unhappy? Hollow Skull, I almost fancy I divine A meaning in thy spectral smile. Saith it not that thy brain, like mine, Still loved, and sought the Beautiful; Loved Truth for Truth's own sake; and sought, Regardless of aught else the while, Like mine, the light of cloudless day— And, in unsatisfying thought By twilight glimmers led astray, Like mine at length sank over-wrought? Every thing fails me—every thing— These instruments, do they not all Mock me? lathe, cylinder, and ring, And cog and wheel—in vain I call On you for aid, ye keys of Science, I stand before the guarded door Of Nature; but it bids defiance To latch or ward: in vain I prove Your powers—the strong bolts will not move. Mysterious, in the blaze of day, Nature pursues her tranquil way: The veil she wears, if hand profane Should seek to raise, it seeks in vain, Though from her spirit thine receives, When hushed it listens and believes, Secrets, revealed—else vainly sought, Her free gift when man questions not, Think not with levers or with screws To wring them out if she refuse. Old furniture—cumbrous and mean! It is not, has not ever been Of use to me—why here? because My father's furniture it was! —Old Roll; and here it still remains, And soiled with smoke, its very stains Might count how many a year the light Hath, from this desk, through the dead night, Burn'd in its sad lamp, nothing bright! —'Twere better did I dissipate, Long since, my little means, than be Crushed down and cumbered with its weight: All that thy fathers leave to thee, At once ENJOY it—thus alone Can man make any thing his own; A hindrance all that we employ not— A burden all that we enjoy not. He knows, who rightly estimates, That what the moment can employ, What it requires and can enjoy, The MOMENT for itself creates. What can it be, that thither draws The eye, and holds it there, as though The flask a very magnet were? And whence, oh, whence this lavish glow, This lustre of enchanted light, Pour'd down at once, and every where— Birth of the moment—like the flood Of splendour round us, when at night Breathes moonlight over a wide wood? Oh phial!—happy phial!—here Hope is,—I greet thee,—I revere Thee as Art's best result—in Thee Science and Mind triumphant see,— Essence of all sweet slumber-dews! Spirit of all most delicate Yet deadliest powers!—be thou my friend— A true friend—thou wilt not refuse Thy own old master this!—I gaze On thee—the pain subsides—the weight That pressed me down less heavy weighs. I grasp thee—faithful friend art thou:— Already do I feel the strife That preyed upon my powers of life Calmed into peace; and now—and now The swell, that troubled the clear spring Of my vext spirit, ebbs away; Outspread, like ocean, Life and Day Shine with a glow of welcoming;— Calm at my feet the glorious mirror lies, And tempts to far-off shores, with smiles from other skies! And, lo! a car of fire to me Glides softly hither; from within Come winged impulses, to bear The child of earth to freer air: Already do I seem to win My happy course, from bondage free, On paths unknown, to climes unknown, Glad spheres of pure activity! Powers yet unfelt—worlds yet untrod— And life, poured every where abroad, And rapture worthy of a God! —Worm that thou art, and can it be Such joy is thine, is given to thee? Determine only,—'tis thy own; Say thy firm farewell to the sun, The kindly sun—its smiling earth— One moment, one,—and all is done,— One pang—then comes the second birth! —Find life where others fear to die; Take measure of thy strength, and burst— Burst wide the gate of liberty; —Show, by man's acts man's spirit durst Meet God's own eye, and wax not dim; Stand fearless, face to face with Him! Shudder not now at that blank cave Where, in self-torturing disease, Pale Fancy hears sad Spirits rave, And is herself the hell she sees. —Press through the strait, where stands Despair Guarding it, and the fiery wave Boils up,—and know no terror there! Determine;—be of happy cheer In this high hour—be thy advance The proud step of a triumph-day; —Be firm, and cast away all fear;— And freely,—if such be the chance— Flow into nothingness away! And thou, clear crystal goblet, welcome thou! Old friend and faithful, from thy antique case Come forth with gay smile now, As gently I displace The time-stain'd velvet; years unnumbered, Forgotten hast thou slumbered; Once bright at many a festival, When, in the old man's hall, Old friends were gathered all, And thou with mirth didst light grave features up, On days of high festivity, And family solemnity, As each to each passed on the happy cup; Its massy pride, the figures rich and old, Of curious carving, and the merry task Of each (thus did our pleasant customs ask) Who drank, the quaint old symbols to unfold, In rhymes made at the moment; then the mask Of serious seeming, as at one long draught Each guest the full deep goblet duly quaffed; The old cup, the old customs, the old rhymes, All now are with me: all, that of old times Can speak, are speaking to my heart; the nights Of boyhood, and their manifold delights; Oh! never more to gay friend sitting next Shall my hand reach thee; never more from me Shall merry rhyme illustrate the old text, And into meaning read each mystery; This is a draught that, if the brain still think, Will set it thinking in another mood; Old cup, now fill thee with the dark brown flood; It is my choice; I mixed it, and will drink: My last draught this on earth I dedicate, (And with it be my heart and spirit borne!) A festal offering to the rising morn. [He places the goblet to his mouth. Bells heard, and voices in chorus. Easter Hymn.—Chorus of Angels. Christ is from the grave arisen, Joy is His. For Him the weary Earth hath ceased its thraldom dreary, And the cares that prey on mortals: He hath burst the grave's stern portals; The grave is no prison: The Lord hath arisen! Faustus. Oh, those deep sounds, those voices rich and heavenly! How powerfully they sway the soul, and force The cup uplifted from the eager lips! Proud bells, and do your peals already ring, To greet the joyous dawn of Easter-morn? And ye, rejoicing choristers, already Flows forth your solemn song of consolation? That song, which once, from angel lips resounding Around the midnight of the grave, was heard, The pledge and proof of a new covenant! Hymn continued.—Chorus of Women. We laid him for burial 'Mong aloes and myrrh; His children and friends Laid their dead Master here! All wrapt in his grave-dress, We left him in fear— Ah! where shall we seek him? The Lord is not here! Chorus of Angels. The Lord hath arisen, Sorrow no longer; Temptation hath tried him, But he was the stronger. Happy, happy victory! Love, submission, self-denial Marked the strengthening agony, Marked the purifying trial; The grave is no prison: The Lord hath arisen. Faustus. Soft sounds, that breathe of Heaven, most mild, most powerful, What seek ye here?—Why will ye come to me In dusty gloom immersed?—Oh! rather speak To hearts of soft and penetrable mould! I hear your message, but I have not faith— And Miracle is Faith's beloved offspring! I cannot force myself into the spheres, Where these good tidings of great joy are heard; And yet, from youth familiar with the sounds, Even now they call me back again to life; Oh! once, in boyhood's time, the love of Heaven Came down upon me, with mysterious kiss Hallowing the stillness of the Sabbath-day! Then did the voices of these bells, melodious Mingle with hopes and feelings mystical; And prayer was then indeed a burning joy! Feelings resistless, incommunicable, Drove me, a wanderer through fields and woods; Then tears rushed hot and fast—then was the birth Of a new life and a new world for me; These bells announced the merry sports of youth, This music welcomed in the happy spring; And now am I once more a little child, And old Remembrance, twining round my heart, Forbids this act, and checks my daring steps— Then sing ye forth—sweet songs that breathe of heaven! Tears come, and Earth hath won her child again. Hymn continued.—Chorus of Disciples. He, who was buried, Hath burst from the grave! From death re-assuming The life that he gave, Is risen in glory, Is mighty to save! And onward—still onward Arising, ascending, To the right hand of Power And Joy never-ending. Enthroned in brightness, His labours are over; On earth his disciples Still struggle and suffer! His children deserted Disconsolate languish— Thou art gone, and to glory— Hast left us in anguish! Chorus of Angels. Christ is arisen, The Lord hath ascended; The dominion of death And corruption is ended. Your work of obedience Haste to begin: Break from the bondage Of Satan and Sin. [Faustus] In your lives HIS laws obey Let love your governed bosoms sway— Blessings to the poor convey, To God with humble spirit pray, To Man his benefits display: Act thus, and he, your Master dear, Though unseen, is ever near!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BEFORE THE GATE. Persons of all descriptions strolling out. A Party of Tradesmen. What are you going for in that direction? Second Party. We are going to the Jägerhaus. First Party. And we Are strolling down to the Mill. A Tradesman. I would advise you Rather to take a walk to the Wasserhof. A Second. The road to it is not a pleasant one. Second Party. What are you for? A Third. I go with the other party. A Fourth. Take my advice, and let us come to Burgdorf: There, any way, we shall be sure of finding The prettiest girls, and the brownest beer, And boxing in the primest style. A Fifth. What, boy, Art at it still? two drubbings, one would think, Might satisfy a reasonable man. I wo'n't go there with you—I hate the place! Servant Maid. No! no!—not I—I'll go back to the town. Another. We'll find him surely waiting at the poplars. The First. Great good is that to me,—he'll give his arm To you—and dance with you—and why should I go For nothing in the world but your amusement? The Second. To-day he'll certainly not be alone, His curly-headed friend will be with him. Student. Look there—look there—how well those girls step out— Come, brother, come let's keep them company. Stiff ale, biting tobacco, and a girl In her smart dress, are the best things I know. Citizen's Daughter. Only look there—what pretty fellows these are! 'Tis quite a shame, when they might have the best Of company, to see them running after A pair of vulgar minxes—servant girls. Second Student (to the First). Stay, easy—here are two fine girls behind us, Showily dressed. I know one of them well— And, I may say, am half in love with her. Innocent things! with what a modest gait And shy step they affect to pace; and yet, For all their bashfulness, they'll take us with them. First Student. Join them, yourself—not I—I hate restraint. Give me the girl that gives a man no trouble, That on the week-days does her week-day work, And, the day after, work that she loves better. Citizen. Well, I do not like this new burgomaster. Not a day passes but he grows more insolent, Forsooth! presuming on his dignity. And what good is he to us after all? The town is growing worse from day to day, They are more strict upon us now than ever, And raise continually the rates and taxes. Beggar (sings). Masters good, and ladies bright, Rosy-cheeked, and richly dressed, Look upon a wretched sight, And relieve the poor distressed: Let me not in vain implore! Pity me!—with chime and voice Would I cheer you—let the poor When all else are glad, rejoice! I must beg, for I must live. Help me! blessed they who give! When all other men are gay Is the beggar's harvest day. Second Citizen. Well! give me, on a saint's day, or a Sunday, When we have time for it, a tale of war And warlike doings far away in Turkey— How they are busy killing one another. 'Tis pleasant to stand gazing from the window, Draining your glass at times, and looking on The painted barges calmly gliding down The easy river. Then the homeward walk In the cool evening hour; this makes the heart Glad, and at peace with all things and itself. Yes! give me peace at home, and peaceful times! Third Citizen. Ay, so say I—break every head abroad— Turn all things topsy-turvy, so they leave us Quiet at home. Old Woman (to the Citizen's Daughters). Ha! but you are nicely dressed, And very pretty creatures—you'll win hearts To-day—ay, that you will—only don't look So very proud—yes! that is something better— I know what my young pets are wishing for, And thinking of, and they shall have it too! Citizen's Daughter. Come, Agatha, come on—I'd not be seen With the old witch in public; yet she showed me, On last St. Andrew's night, in flesh and blood, My future lover. The Other. In the glass she showed Me mine. The figure was a soldier's, and With him a band of gay bold fellows. Since, I have been looking round, and seeking for him, But all in vain—'tis folly—he won't come. Soldier. Towns with turrets, walls, and fences, Maidens with their haughty glances, These the soldier seeks with ardour, Say to conquer which is harder? Death and danger he despises, When he looks upon the prizes. Danger is the soldier's duty, And his prize is fame and beauty. Rush we, at the trumpet's measure, With blithe hearts to death and pleasure; How the soldier's blood is warming When we think of cities storming! Fortress strong, and maiden tender, Must alike to us surrender. Danger is the soldier's duty, But his prize is fame and beauty. Faustus. River and rivulet are freed from ice In Spring's affectionate inspiring smile— Green are the fields with promise—far away To the rough hills old Winter hath withdrawn Strengthless—but still at intervals will send Light feeble frosts, with drops of diamond white Mocking a little while the coming bloom— Still soils with showers of sharp and bitter sleet, In anger impotent, the earth's green robe; But the sun suffers not the lingering snow— Every where life—every where vegetation— All nature animate with glowing hues— Or, if one spot be touched not by the spirit Of the sweet season, there, in colours rich As trees or flowers, are sparkling human dresses! Turn round, and from this height look back upon The town: from its black dungeon gate forth pours, In thousand parties, the gay multitude, All happy, all indulging in the sunshine! All celebrating the Lord's resurrection, And in themselves exhibiting as 'twere A resurrection too—so changed are they, So raised above themselves. From chambers damp Of poor mean houses—from consuming toil Laborious—from the work-yard and the shop— From the imprisonment of walls and roofs, And the oppression of confining streets, And from the solemn twilight of dim churches— All are abroad—all happy in the sun. Look, only look, with gaiety how active, Thro' fields and gardens they disperse themselves! How the wide water, far as we can see, Is joyous with innumerable boats! See, there, one almost sinking with its load Parts from the shore; yonder the hill-top paths Are sparkling in the distance with gay dresses! And, hark! the sounds of joy from the far village! Oh! happiness like this is real heaven! The high, the low, in pleasure all uniting— Here may I feel that I too am a man! Wagner. Doctor, to be with you is creditable— Instructive too: but never would I loiter Here by myself—I hate these coarse amusements: Fiddlers, and clamorous throats, and kettle-drums, Are to my mind things quite intolerable; Men rave, as if possessed by evil spirits, And call their madness joy and harmony! (Peasants dancing and singing.) The shepherd for the dance was drest In ribands, wreath, and Sunday vest; All were dancing full of glee, Underneath the linden tree! 'Tis merry and merry—heigh-ho, heigh-ho, Blithe goes the fiddle-bow! Soon he runs to join the rest; Up to a pretty girl he prest; With elbow raised and pointed toe, Bent to her with his best bow— Pressed her hand: with feigned surprise, Up she raised her timid eyes! “'Tis strange that you should use me so, So, so—heigh-ho— 'Tis rude of you to use me so.” All into the set advance, Right they dance, and left they dance— Gowns and ribands how they fling, Flying with the flying ring; They grew red, and faint, and warm, And rested, sinking, arm in arm. Slow, slow, heigh-ho, Tired in elbow, foot, and toe! “And do not make so free,” she said; “I fear that you may never wed; Men are cruel”—and he prest The maiden to his beating breast. Hark! again, the sounds of glee Swelling from the linden tree. 'Tis merry, 'tis merry—heigh-ho, heigh-ho, Blithe goes the fiddle-bow! Old Peasant. This, doctor, is so kind of you, A man of rank and learning too; Who, but yourself, would condescend Thus with the poor, the poor man's friend, To join our sports? In this brown cheer Accept the pledge we tender here, A draught of life may it become And years on years, oh! may you reach, As cheerful as these beads of foam, As countless, too, a year for each! Faustus. Blest be the draught restorative! I pledge you—happy may you live! [The people collect in a circle round him. Old Peasant. Yes! witness thou the poor man's glee, And share in his festivity: In this hath fortune fairly dealt With him who, in the evil day Of the black sickness, with us dwelt, When Plague was numbering his prey— In strength and health how many gather To this day's pastimes, whom thy father Rescued from death in that last stage, When the disease, tired out at length Is followed by the fever's rage, And prostrate sinks the vital strength; And you, too, in that time of dread And death, a young man, visited Each house of sickness:—evermore, Day after day, the black hearse bore Corse after corse—still, day by day, The good man held his fearless way Unscathed; for God a blessing gave, And saved the man who sought to save. All. For thee, tried friend, our prayers we raise, And, when we wish thee length of days, 'Tis for himself that each man prays. Faustus. In thanks to the Great Father bend, We are but servants to extend Blessings, that flow from man's one Friend. Wagner. With what a sense of pure delight, Master, must thou enjoy the sight Of this vast crowd, and the unchecked Expression of their deep respect! Oh, happy he, who thus to Heaven Can render back the talents given! The pious father points thee out To his young folk—they gaze, and ask, And gaze again—and crowd about. The blithe musician in his task Pauses—the dancers turn to thee, And gather into groups to see The man they honour passing by— And then the gratulating shout— And then the caps flung up on high: They almost worship thee—almost Would bend the knee as to the host. Faustus. A few steps farther—and we reach yon stone; Here sit we down, and rest after our walk— Here have I often sate in thoughtful mood Alone—and here in agonies of prayer, And fast, and vigil—rich in hope—in faith Unwavering—sought with tears and sighs, and hands Wringing in supplication, to extort From Him in heaven, that he would stay that plague. These praises come upon my ear like scorn— Oh, could you read the secrets of this heart, You then would see how little we deserved, Father or son, the thanks of these poor people. My father, a reserved and moody man, Not without pride, felt by himself and others, Living almost alone, held strange opinions, Tinged with the hues of his peculiar mind, And, therefore, even the more indulged and cherished. Thus fanciful, and serious in his fancies, O'er Nature and her consecrated circles, That with vain interdict sought to oppose, Oft would he try his wild experiments: In his black cell with crucible and fire (One or two adepts his sole company) He toiled; and, following many a quaint receipt, Would force rebellious metals to obey, And in indissoluble union link Antagonists irreconcilable. There, passionate adorer, the Red Lion With the White Lily, in a tepid bath Was strangely wedded—and his silver bride And he from chamber hurried on to chamber, Tortured and tried with many a fiery pang, Suffered together, till in coloured light, Ascending in the glass, shone the Young Queen: This was our medicine—they who took it died, None asked, or thought of asking, who recovered. Thus have we with our diabolic mixture, In these sweet valleys, 'mong these quiet hills, Been guests more fatal than the pestilence. I have myself to thousands given this poison, They withered, and are dead—and I must live, I, who have been their death, must live to hear This lavish praise on the rash murderers. Wagner. How can this be so painful? Can a man Do more than practise what his own day knows— All that thy father taught must have been heard, By thee, as by a young man learning then— Heard in the docile spirit of belief. When thy time came to teach, thou didst enlarge The field of science; and thy son, who learns From thee, will for himself discoveries make, Greater than thine, perhaps—yet but for thine Impossible. If this be so, why grieve? Faustus. Oh, he, indeed, is happy, who still feels, And cherishes within his heart the hope To lift himself above this sea of errors! Of things we know not, each day do we find The want of knowledge—all we know is useless: But 'tis not wise to sadden with such thoughts This hour of beauty and benignity: Look yonder, with delighted heart and eye, On those low cottages that shine so bright (Each with its garden plot of smiling green), Robed in the glory of the setting sun! But he is parting—fading,—day is over— Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh, for a wing to raise me up from earth, Nearer, and yet more near, to the bright orb, That unrestrained I still might follow him! Then should I see, in one unvarying glow Of deathless evening, the reposing world Beneath me—the hills kindling—the sweet vales, Beyond the hills, asleep in the soft beams; The silver streamlet, at the silent touch Of heavenly light, transfigured into gold, Flowing in brightness inexpressible! Nothing to stop or stay my godlike motion! The rugged hill, with its wild cliffs, in vain Would rise to hide the sun; in vain would strive To check my glorious course; the sea already, With its illumined bays, that burn beneath The lord of day, before the astonished eyes Opens its bosom—and he seems at last Just sinking—no—a power unfelt before— An impulse indescribable succeeds! Onward, entranced, I haste to drink the beams Of the unfading light—before me day— And night left still behind—and overhead Wide heaven—and under me the spreading sea!— A glorious vision, while the setting sun Is lingëring! Oh, to the spirit's flight, How faint and feeble are material wings! Yet such our nature is, that when the lark, High over us, unseen, in the blue sky Thrills his heart-piercing song, we feel ourselves Press up from earth, as 'twere in rivalry,— And when above the savage hill of pines, The eagle sweeps with outspread wings,—and when The crane pursues, high off his homeward path, Flying o'er watery moors and wide lakes lonely! Wagner. I, too, have had my hours of reverie; But impulse such as this I never felt. Of wood and field the eye will soon grow weary; I'd never envy the wild birds their wings. How different are the pleasures of the mind, Leading from book to book, from leaf to leaf, They make the nights of winter bright and cheerful; They spread a sense of pleasure through the frame, And when you see some old and treasured parchments, All heaven descends to your delighted senses! Faustus. Thy heart, my friend, now knows but one desire; Oh, never learn another! in my breast, Alas! two souls have taken their abode, And each is struggling there for mastery! One to the world, and the world's sensual pleasures, Clings closely, with scarce separable organs; The other struggles to redeem itself, And rise from the entanglements of earth— Still feels its true home is not here—still longs And strives—and would with violence regain The fields, its own by birthright—realms of light And joy, where,—Man in vain would disbelieve The instincts of his nature, that confirm The loved tradition,—dwelt our sires of old. If—as 'tis said—spirits be in the air, Moving, with lordly wings, 'tween earth and heaven, And if, oh if ye listen when we call, Come from your golden “incense-breathing” clouds, Bear me away to new and varied life! Oh, were the magic mantle mine, which bore The wearer at his will to distant lands, How little would I prize the envied robes Of princes, and the purple pomp of kings! Wagner. Venture not thus to invoke the well-known host, Who spread, a living stream, through the waste air, Who watch industriously man's thousand motions, For ever active in the work of evil. From all sides pour they on us: from the north, With thrilling hiss, they drive their arrowy tongues; And, speeding from the parching east, they feed On the dry lungs, and drink the breath of life; And the south sends them forth, at middle day, From wildernesses dry and desolate, To heap fresh fire upon the burning brain; And from the west they flow, a cloudy deluge, That, like the welcome shower of early spring, First promises refreshment and relief, Then rushing down, with torrents ruinous, Involves in one unsparing desolation Valley, and meadow-field, and beast, and man:— Ready for evil, with delight they hear, Obey man's bidding to deceive his soul. Like angel-ministers of Heaven they seem, And utter falsehoods with an angel's voice. But let's away—the sky is grey already, The air grows chill—the mist is falling heavy— At evening home's the best place for a man! What ails thee? why, with such astonished eyes, Dost thou stand staring into the dusk twilight? What seest thou there that can affect thee thus? Faustus. Do you see that black dog, where through the green blades Of the soft springing corn, and the old stubble, He runs, just glancing by them for a moment? Wagner. I've seen him this while past, but thought not of him As any way strange. Faustus. Look at him carefully, What do you take him now to be? Wagner. Why, nothing But a rough poodle-dog, who, in the way Of dogs, is searching for his master's footsteps. Faustus. Do you observe how in wide serpent circles He courses round us? nearer and yet nearer Each turn,—and if my eyes do not deceive me, Sparkles of fire whirl where his foot hath touched Wagner. I can see nothing more than a black dog; It must be some deception of your eyes. Faustus. Methinks he draws light magic threads around us, Hereafter to entangle and ensnare! Wagner. In doubt and fear the poodle's leaping round us, Seeing two strangers in his master's stead. Faustus. The circle, see, how much more narrow 'tis,— He's very near us! Wagner. 'Tis a dog, you see, And not a spectre; see, he snarls at strangers, Barks, lies upon his belly, wags his tail, As all dogs do. Faustus. We'll bring him home with us.— Come, pretty fellow! Wagner. He's a merry dog,— If you stand still, he stands and waits for you,— Speak to him, and he straight leaps up upon you,— Leave something after you, no doubt he'll bring it, Or plunge into the water for your stick. Faustus. You're right—I can see nothing of the spectre In him; it can be nothing more than training. Wagner. A dog, well-trained, soon learns the art To win upon a good man's heart;— The wisest love them best—and see, Our friend already follows thee— Soon shall we see the happy creature, Prime favourite, round the doctor skip: With every student for his teacher, How can we doubt his scholarship?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene. Faustus's Study. Enter Faustus, with the Dog. Faustus. O'er silent field, and lonely lawn Her dusky mantle night hath drawn; At twilight's holy heartfelt hour, In man his better soul hath power. The passions are at peace within, And still each stormy thought of sin. The yielding bosom, overawed, Breathes love to man, and love to God! Rest, poodle, rest—lie down in quiet! Why runs he up and down the floor? What can it be he looks so shy at, Smelling and snuffling at the door? Pleasant wert thou in our mountain ramble, Didst make us merry with trick and gambol, Go to sleep on the cushion—a soft snug nest— Take thy ease, in thine inn, like a welcome guest. When in our narrow cell each night, The lone lamp sheds its friendly light, When from the bosom doubt and fear Pass off like clouds, and leave it clear— Then reason re-assumes her reign, And hope begins to bloom again, And in the hush of outward strife, We seem to hear the streams of life, And seek, alas!—in vain essay— Its hidden fountains far away. Cease, dog, to growl, thy beastly howl Ill suits the holy tone of feeling, Whose influence o'er my soul is stealing— With men 'tis common to contemn, Whatever is too good, too fair, Too high to be conceived by them, And is't that like those wretched carles, This dog, at what he knows not, snarls! These withering thoughts, do what I will, They come—the fountain of the heart is chill. —How oft have I experienced change like this! Yet is it not unblest in the event; For, seeking to supply the natural dearth, We learn to prize things loftier than the earth, And the heart seeks support and light from heaven. And such support and light—oh, is it given Any where but in the New Testament? Strong impulse sways me to translate the text Of that most holy book with honest feeling, In the loved language of my native land, The mysteries of heavenly truth revealing. [He opens a volume, and prepares to commence his translation. “In the beginning was the Word,”—alas! The first line stops me—how shall I proceed? “The word” cannot express the meaning here— I must translate the passage differently, If by the spirit I am rightly guided. Once more,—“In the beginning was the Thought,”— Consider the first line attentively, Lest hurrying on too fast you lose the meaning. Was it then Thought that has created all things? Can Thought make Matter? let us try the line Once more,—“In the beginning was the Power,”— This will not do—even while I write the phrase I feel its faults—oh, help me, Holy Spirit, I'll weigh the passage once again, and write Boldly,—“In the beginning was the Act.” —Cease, teasing dog, this angry howl, These moans dissatisfied and dull,— Down, dog, or I must be rougher, Noise like this I cannot suffer,— One of us must leave the closet, if You still keep growling—that is positive; To use a guest so is not pleasant, But none could bear this whine incessant! The door you see is open yonder, And let me hint; you're free to wander— But can what I see be real, Or is all some trick ideal? 'Tis surely something more than nature,— Form is changed, and size, and stature, Larger, loftier, erecter, This seeming dog must be a spectre;— With fiery eyes, jaws grinding thus, Like an hippopotamus, —And here to bring this whelp of hell, Oh, at last, I know thee well, For such half-devilish, hellish spawn, Nought's like the lock of Solomon. Spirits without. One is in prison: Listen to reason: Uenture not on: Where he hath gone Follow him none: Watch we all! watch we well! The old lynx of hell Has fallen in the snare, Is trapped unaware, Like a fox in the gin; He is in: he is in: Stay we without, Sweep we about, Backward and forward. Southward and norward, Our colleague assisting, His fetters untwisting, Lightening their pressure By mystical measure, At our motions and voices, Our brother rejoices, For us hath he offered, His safety, and suffered, We are his debtors, Let's loosen his fetters. Faustus. To conquer him must I rehearse, First that deep mysterious verse, Which each elemental spirit, Of the orders four, who hear it. Trembling, will confess and fear it. Scorching Salamander, burn, Nymph of Water, twist and turn, Uanish, Sylph, to thy far home, Labour vex thee, drudging Gnome. He is but a sorry scholar, To whom each elemental ruler, Their acts and attributes essential, And their influence potential, And their sympathies auxiliar, Are not matters quite familiar; Little knows he, little merits A dominion over Spirits. Fiery Salamander, wither In the red flame's fiery glow! Rushing, as waves rush together, Water-nymph, in water flow! Gleamy Sylph of Air, glance fleeter, And more bright, than midnight meteor! Slave of homely drudgery, Lubber Incubus, flee, flee To the task that waits for thee! Spirit, that within the beast Art imprisoned, be releast! Kingly sway hath Solomon Over subject spirits won; —Forth!—obey the spell and seal Elemental natures feel! By Spirits of a different kind, Is the brute possessed, I find; Grinning he lies, and mocks the charm That has no power to work him harm. Spectre! by a stronger spell Thy obedience I compel— Outcast creature, see the sign Of the Human and Divine. Bow before the Uncreated, Whom the world has seen and hated: Canst thou read Him? Canst thou see? Dread to hear me name His name, Through all heaven diffused is He, Died on earth a death of shame. Ha! with terror undissembled, Methinks the brute at last has trembled; As behind the stove he lies, See him swell and see him pant; And his bristles how they rise As he rouses,—and his size Large as is the elephant,— Larger yet the room he crowds,— He will vanish in the clouds. —Spare the roof in thy retreat, Lie down at the master's feet. Thou shalt feel the scorching glow (Mine is not an idle threat) Of the heat divine—shalt know Pangs of fiercer torment yet. —Still resisting?—Tarry not For the three-times glowing light, Blaze beyond endurance bright— Reluctantly must I at length Speak the spell of greatest strength. Mephistopheles comes forward, as the mist sinks, in the dress of a travelling scholar, from behind the stove. Mephistopheles. Why all this uproar? Is there any thing In my poor power to serve you? Faustus. This then was The poodle's kernel—travelling scholar—psha!— A most strange case of the kind—I cannot but Laugh when I think of it. Mephistopheles. Most learned master, Your humble servant—you've been broiling me After a pretty fashion—sweated me To the very vengeance. I'm in a fine stew. Faustus. Thy name. Mephistopheles. What! ask so frivolous a question? You, who esteem the Word so very lightly, Manifestations being nothing worth;— Who, undeluded by the shows that cheat The gross material eye, would look into Nothing less than the very depth and essence Of beings! Faustus. With you, gentlemen, we learn The nature of the being from the name. Generally, 'tis a most expressive one: For instance, one of you is called the God Of Flies—one the Corrupter—one the Liar— What are you now? Mephistopheles. A member of that power Which evermore wills evil, and does good. Faustus. What may this riddle mean? Mephistopheles. I am the Spirit That evermore deny,—and in denying Evermore am I right—“No!” say I, “No!” To all projected or produced—whate'er Comes into being merits nothing but Perdition—better then that nothing were Brought into being;—what you men call sin— Destruction—in short, evil—is my province, My proper element. Faustus. You call yourself A part, yet stand before me whole. Mephistopheles. I speak The truth—the modest truth—though man may deem, —World that he is of folly,—of himself, As of a whole, such am not I—I am Part of a part, which part at first was all, A part of Darkness who gave birth to Light; Proud Light, who each day is diminishing Her mother's rank, confines each day her range, Yet conquers not, for in the constant strife Light still must cling to body for existence; From body streams she—she makes body bright; Body opposes and arrests her beams; And so, I trust, when body is no more, Light, too, will share the inevitable doom. Faustus. A creditable line of business this; If I conceive you rightly, wholesale dealing Has with you been a most unprosperous trade. Nothing can you reduce to nothing, and After your failure are beginning business Upon a smaller scale. Mephistopheles. And even in this way But little can be done,—there ever is To that, which would make nothing, still the something Opposed of the coarse world,—the clumsy lump— There stands it still resisting. I have tried Every thing—deluges, storms, earthquakes, lightnings— Still rests it there the self-same sea and land. Even o'er the death-doomed race of men and beasts, How little is the conquest I have gained! How many generations in their graves Have I seen laid, and still the young fresh blood Will circulate, and still the spirit of life Decays not! 'Tis enough to drive me mad. In air, in water, and in earth, up spring A thousand bursting germs; in dry and damp, In warm and cold—all things are full of life. Fire is the one exception—were there not A saving clause of that kind, I'd have nothing, Nothing whatever, I could call my own. Faustus. So thou opposest thy cold devil's fist, And clenchest it in malice impotent, 'Gainst nature's first and holiest principle— Strange son of chaos, this may well move laughter. Mephistopheles. Well—this point we may talk about hereafter— But now, with your permission, I would go. Faustus. That you can, whether I permit or no. Why ask me? Now that you have found your way, I hope to see you often here. Good day!— This the window—that the door—and yonder The chimney. Why thus stare about and ponder? Mephistopheles. I am not free: a little obstacle, I did not see, confines me to your cell,— The druid foot upon the threshold traced. Faustus. The pentagram?—is it not to your taste? But, son of hell, if this indeed be so, How came you in, I should be glad to know,— How was it, that the charm no earlier wrought? Mephistopheles. The lines were not as perfect as they ought: The outer angle's incomplete. Faustus. Well—'twas a pleasant evening's feat— A most unlooked-for accident— Strange prize, and yet more strangely sent. Mephistopheles. The dog, without perceiving it, Leaped in—the devil has somehow Seen it—is in the house—and now Can find no way of leaving it. Faustus. Why not the window? Mephistopheles. Why?—because It is enacted in the laws Which bind us devils and phantoms, “that Whatever point we enter at, We at the same return:”—thus we In our first choice are ever free;— —Choose,—and the right of choice is o'er, We, who were free, are free no more. Faustus. Hell has its codes of law then—well, I will think better now of hell. If laws be binding and obeyed, Then compacts with you may be made. Mephistopheles. Made and fulfilled, too—nowhere better— We keep our promise to the letter; But points of law like this require Some time and thought—are apt to tire, And I am hurried—we may treat On them at leisure when we meet Again—but now I ask permission To go. Faustus. One moment—I am wishing To question further one who brings Good news, and tells such pleasant things. Mephistopheles. Let me go now—I come again, You may ask any question then. Faustus. Ay, old fox, ay, come, catch me there— I laid no net—I set no snare, And if you walked into the trap— 'Twas your own act, and my good hap; Luck like this can hardly last— Catch the devil and keep him fast— Part with a prize, on which none could have reckoned! The first chance gone, pray who will give a second? Mephistopheles. If you insist on it—I stay; And just to while the hours away, I would amuse you, as I may; For I have pleasant arts and power, With shows to while the passing hour. Faustus. If it be pleasant, try your art— As audience I will play my part. Mephistopheles. In one hour shall more intense Pleasure flow on every sense, Than the weary year could give, In such life as here you live— The songs soft spirits sing to thee, The images they bring to thee, Are no empty exhibition Of the skill of a magician; Pictures fair and music's tone, Speak to eye and ear alone; But odours sweet around thee sporting, Lingering tastes thy palate courting, Feelings gratified, enraptured, All thy senses shall be captured. Preparation need not we— Spirits, begin your melody. Spirits sing. Uanish, dark arches, That over us bend, Let the blue sky in beauty Look in like a friend. Oh, that the black clouds Asunder were riven, That the small stars were brightening All through the wide heaven! And look at them smiling In beautiful splendour, Suns, but with glory More placid and tender; Children of heaven, In spiritual beauty, Descending, and bending With billowy motion, And others, their brothers, Downward are thronging, Willing devotion Flowing to meet them, Loving hearts longing, Sighing to greet them. O'er field and o'er flower, On bank and in bower, Ribands are fluttering, Graceful they move, Where lovers are uttering Feelings of love, Bower on bower, Tendril and flower: Clustering grapes, The vine's purple treasure, Have fallen in the wine-vat, And bleed in its pressure— Foaming and steaming, the new wine is streaming, Over bright precious stones It rolls on from its fountain, Leaving behind it Meadow and mountain, It lingers in wide lakes, more leisurely flowing Where the hills to behold it with pleasure are glowing. And the winged throng Fly rejoicing along, Onward and onward, With wings steering sun-ward, To where the bright islands, with magical motion, Stir with the waves of the stirring ocean. Where we hear 'em shout in chorus, Or see 'em dance on lawns before us, As over land or over waters Chance the idle parties scatters. Some upon the far hills gleaming, Some along the bright lakes streaming, Some their forms in air suspending, Float in circles never-ending. All their feeling and employment Is the spirit of enjoyment, While the gracious stars above them Smile to say how much they love them. Mephistopheles. He sleeps,—thanks to my little favourites— Why ye have fairly sung away his wits, And so he thought the devil to catch and keep!— Well, well, I am a concert in your debt— Still cloud with dreams his unsuspecting sleep, Antic and wild!—still in illusion steep His fancy!—hover round and round him yet, Haply dreaming, that I am Prisoner of the pentagram! —Tooth of rat ... gets rid of that ... Gnawing, sawing, bit by bit, Till there be no trace of it;— Little need of conjuring, Rats to such a place to bring; One is rustling in the wall, He will hear my whispered call— The master of the Mice and Rats, Flies and Frogs, and Bugs and Bats, Sends his summons to appear;— Forth! and gnaw the threshold here:— He hath spilt the fragrant oil, Till it vanish tooth must toil:— —Sir Rat hath heard me—see him run To the task that soon is done; Yonder angle, 'tis, confines Your master—gnaw the meeting-lines:— Now the corner, near the door, All is done in one bite more. The prisoner and the pentagram are gone, Dream, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on! Faustus (awaking). Am I again deceived?—and must I deem These gorgeous images, but phantoms shaped In the delusion of a lying dream? And so there was no devil at all, 'twould seem— And it was but a poodle that escaped!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAUSTUS'S STUDY. FAUSTUS—MEPHISTOPHELES. Faustus. A knock!—Come in—who now comes to torment me? Mephistopheles. 'Tis I. Faustus. Come in. Mephistopheles. You must command me thrice. Faustus. Come in, then. Mephistopheles. That will do—I'm satisfied— We soon shall be the best friends in the world. [Enters. From your mind to scatter wholly The mists of peevish melancholy, Hither come I now, and bear Of a young lord the noble air, And mask me in his character; My dress is splendid, you behold, Blazing with the ruddy gold, With my stiff silken mantle's pride, And the long sword hanging by my side, And o'er my cap the cock's proud feather— I'm a fine fellow altogether. And now, my friend, without delay, Equip yourself in like array, That, light and free, you thus may see Life's many pleasures what they be! Faustus. Oh! I would feel in such a dress more bitterly The narrow cramping limits of man's nature! I am too old to yield myself to pleasure, Too young to have the appetite departed. What can earth give me now? “Refrain, refrain!” This is the everlasting song—the chime Perpetually jingling in the ears, And with hoarse accents every hour repeats it. Each morn, with a dull sense of something dreadful, I wake, and from my bitter heart could weep To see another day, which, in its course, Will not fulfil one wish of mine—not one! The teasing crowd of small anxieties, That each day brings, have frittered into dust All joy, until the very hope of joy Is something, that the heart has ceased to feel;— And life's poor masquerade—vapid and wayward, And worthless as it is—breaks in upon, And dissipates, the world, which for itself The lonely man's imagination builds; —And, when the night is come, with heavy heart Must I lie down upon my bed, where rest Is never granted me, where wild dreams come, Hideous and scaring. The in-dwelling spirit, Whose temple is my heart, who rules its powers, Can stir the bosom to its lowest depths, But has no power to move external nature; And therefore is existence burdensome, And death desirable, and life detested. Mephistopheles. Yet death's a guest not altogether welcome. Faustus. Oh, happy he for whom, in victory's hour Of splendour, death around his temples binds The laurel dyed with blood, and happy he Whom, in his true love's arms, he finds reposing— Oh, that before that mighty Spirit's power My individual being was dissolved, My life absorbed, my soul unchained from earth! Mephistopheles. And yet one night I saw a certain man Forbear to taste a certain dark-brown liquid. Faustus. 'Tis then, it seems, your gentlemanly practice To amuse yourself in playing the spy's part. Mephistopheles. I know not ALL, but some things I do know. Faustus. And if from harrowing thoughts the rich old chaunt Did win me; and the old remembered words, And the old music, like a spell recalling Faded remembrances;—if, in the trance, All that remained of my boy's heart was captive To the charmed echo of more happy days— Know I not—feel I not it was illusion? —We are but what the senses make of us!— And this, and all illusion do I curse; All that beguiles us man or boy—that winds Over the heart its nets, and chains us here In thraldom down or voluntary trance; This magic jugglery, that fools the soul,— These obscure powers that cloud and flatter it! Oh, cursed first of all be the high thoughts That man conceives of his own attributes! And cursed be the shadowy appearances, The false delusive images of things. That slave and mock the senses! cursed be The hypocrite dreams that soothe us when we think Of fame—of deathless and enduring names! Cursed be all that, in self-flattery, We call our own,—wife, child, or slave, or plough;— Curse upon Mammon, when with luring gold He stirs our souls to hardy deeds, or when He spreads the couch of indolent repose; A curse upon the sweet grape's balmy juice; And the passionate joys of love,—man's highest joys! And cursed be all hope and all belief; And cursed, more than all, man's tame endurance. Song of invisible Spirits. Woe! woe! Thou hast destroyed it! This beautiful world: Mighty his hand who dealt The blow through Nature felt! Earth withers: a Demigod cursed it! A shock from the Spirit that shaped and enjoyed it; A blight from the bosom that nursed it! The fragments we sweep Down Night's desolate steep, O'er the fading glitter we mourn and we weep!— Proud and powerful Son of earth, To second birth, Call again the pageant splendid— Oh, restore what thou hast rended— Be no more the wreck thou art— Re-commence, with clearer sense, And build within thy secret heart; Re-create, with better fate, Another world on firmer ground, And far and near, and all around, With songs of joy and triumphing, Heaven and the happy earth shall ring. Mephistopheles. Listen to the witching lay! Wise and wily ones be they; Little ones of mine, and good Children are they—sly and shrewd; Childlike are their voices—age Never uttered words more sage; Active life—the joys of sense Counsels all experience,— And my little ones do well, Courting thee 'mong men to dwell, Far from this monastic cell; Where passions and young blood together In solitude grow dry and wither. Oh, listen, and let charms like these Thy feelings and thy fancy seize. Cease to indulge this misanthropic humour, Which like a vulture preys upon thy life; The worst society will make thee feel That thou, too, art a man, and among men— Not that I mean to mix you with the rabble. I'm not myself one of the higher orders; But if you will in company with me See life, I will contrive to manage matters, And make arrangements to convenience you, Cheerfully—from this moment am your comrade; Or, if you like me, am your servant—nay, Your slave. Faustus. And what must I give in return? Mephistopheles. Oh, time enough to think of that hereafter. Faustus. No, no! the devil is selfish—very selfish— Does nothing for God's sake or from good nature: Come, out with your conditions, and speak plainly— There's little luck, I trow, with such a servant. Mephistopheles. I bind myself to be thy servant here, To run and rest not at thy beck and bidding; And when we meet again in yonder place, There, in like manner, thou shalt be my servant. Faustus. That yonder place gives me but small concern; When thou hast first shattered this world to atoms, There may be others then, for aught I care. All joys, that I can feel, from this earth flow, And this sun shines upon my miseries! And were I once divorced from them I care not What may hereafter happen—of these things I'll hear no more—I do not seek to know If man, in future life, still hates and loves; If in the spheres above, as well as here, Are differences of suffering and enjoyment, Debasement and superiority. Mephistopheles. With feelings such as these you well may venture. Make only the engagement, and at once All will be pleasure—I have rare devices, And of my craft will show thee many marvels, Right strange and merry scenes will conjure up: Sights shalt thou see that man hath never seen. Faustus. Thou—what hast thou—poor devil?—The heart of Man— Man's seeking—struggling spirit,—hopes,—aspirings Infinite—are they things to be conceived By natures such as thou art? yet hast thou, Poor devil, in thy degree, a wherewithal To wile and win us;—delicates uncloying Are—are they not?—among these lures of thine? Yea! hast thou the red gold that restlessly Like quicksilver glides from the hand?—a game At which none wins, yet is it play?—a girl That, with her lavish arms around my breast, And from her nestling-place on my poor bosom With willing eyes ogles and wooes another. —And splendour hast thou?—rank?—wilt give me these?— The star-bright meteors of Ambition's heaven? Ay! let me see this pleasant fruit of thine, That rots before we gather it—the trees That each day bud and bloom anew. The worlde that neweth every daie. Gower, Confessio Amantis. Mephistopheles. This order Is without difficulty executed— Fine things to fancy—and they shall be yours; But by and by we'll find the Doctor's taste Improving,—we'll have our own pleasant places, And our tit bits, and our snug little parties, And—what will keep the Doctor's spirit quiet;— —I promise you, you'll feel what comfort is. Faustus. Comfort and quiet!—no, no! none of these For me;—I ask them not—I seek them not. If ever I upon the bed of sloth Lie down and rest, then be the hour, in which I so lie down and rest, my last of life. Canst thou by falsehood or by flattery Make me one moment with myself at peace, Cheat me into tranquillity? come, then, And welcome life's last day—be this our wager. Mephistopheles. Done. Faustus. Done, say I—clench we at once the bargain. If ever time should flow so calmly on, Soothing my spirits into such oblivion, That in the pleasant trance I would arrest, And hail the happy moment in its course, Bidding it linger with me—“Oh, how fair “Art thou, delicious moment!”—“Happy days, “Why will ye flee?”—“Fair visions! yet a little “Abide with me, and bless me—fly not yet,” Or words like these—then throw me into fetters— Then willingly do I consent to perish; Then may the death-bell peal its heavy sounds; Then is thy service at an end—and then The clock may cease to strike—the hand to move— For me be time then passed away for ever! Mephistopheles. Consider well—for we will not forget. Faustus. Remember, or forget it, as you please; I have resolved—and that not rashly: here, While I remain, I needs must be a slave— What matter, therefore, whether thine, or whose? Mephistopheles. I will to-day, then, at the Doctor's table Attend as servant, and discharge the duties. Just one thing more—as life and death's uncertain, I'd wish to have a line or two in writing. Faustus. And dost thou ask a writing, too, poor pedant? Know you not Man? Man's nature? or Man's word? Is it not enough that I have spoken it? My very life—all that I have and am, What is it but an echo of my word, Pledge of the will that gives it utterance? If words be nothing, what is writing more? Is the world's course one sea of stormy madness,— Its thousand streams, in conflict everlasting, Raving regardlessly? roll they not on? Must they not roll?—and can it be that I, In this perpetual movement, shall not move— Held back, the slave and prisoner of a promise? Yet in this fancy all believe alike: If a delusion, all men are deluded— And is there one that would be undeceived? Truth and the feeling of integrity Are of the heart's own essence—should they call For sufferings, none repents the sacrifice. Oh, happy he, whom Truth accompanies In all his walks—from outward cumbrance free— Pure of all soil—dwelling within the heart, Light to his steps and guidance: oracle To lead or to mislead, none doth he seek; Consults no casuist, but an honest conscience; Of sacrifices recks not, and repents not. But a stamped parchment and a formal deed, With seal and signature, all shrink from this As something that offends and wounds our nature; It robs, methinks, the words of all their life, The letter, and that only binds us now; Such virtue, and no other can it have, As seal and stamp, as lead and wax can give— But why?—why argue for it or against it?— Is writing more than the unwritten word? —What, evil one, what is it you require? Brass? marble? parchment? paper?—do you wish Graver or chissel? or plain pen and ink?— Have which you please—any or all of them. Mephistopheles. Why this excitement? why this waste of oratory? These frantic gestures?—any scrap will do;— Just scratch your name, there, in a drop of blood. Faustus. A silly farce—but if it gratifies you— Mephistopheles. Blood it must be—blood has peculiar virtues. Faustus. Fear not that I will break this covenant: The only impulse now that sways my powers, My sole desire in life, is what I've promised! I've been puffed up with fancies too aspiring, My rank is not more high than thine; I am Degraded and despised by the Great Spirit; Nature is sealed from me; the web of thought Is shattered; burst into a thousand threads; I loathe, and sicken at the name of knowledge. Now in the depths of sensuality To still these burning passions; to be wrapped In the impenetrable cloak of magic, With things miraculous to feast the senses! Let's fling ourselves into the stream of time, Into the tumbling waves of accident, Let pain and pleasure, loathing and enjoyment, Mingle and alternate, as it may be; Restlessness is man's best activity. Mephistopheles. Nothing whatever is there to restrain you— If your desires be as you say, to taste Of every sweet—sip all things—settle nowhere— Catching each moment while upon the wing In random motion all that meets the eye, Rifling from every flower its bloom and fragrance, If any thing will do that is amusing— I wish you joy of this new life—come on— Set to at once—come—come, no bashful loitering. Faustus. Hearken. I have not said one word of bliss— Henceforth do I devote and yield myself, Heart, soul, and life, to rapturous excitement— Such dizzy, such intoxicating joy, As, when we stand upon a precipice, Makes reel the giddy sense and the brain whirl! From this day forward am I dedicate To the indulgence of tempestuous passion— Love agonising—idolising hatred— Cheering vexation—all that animates And is our nature; and the heart, serened And separated from the toil of knowledge, Cured of the fever that so long oppressed it, Shall cease to shut itself against the wounds Of pain: whate'er is portioned 'mong mankind In my own intimate self shall I enjoy, With my soul grasp all thoughts most high or deep, Heap on my heart all human joys and woes, Expand myself until mankind become A part, as 'twere, of my identity, And they and I at last together perish. Mephistopheles. Believe me, who for many thousand years Have fed on this hard food unwillingly. Man from the cradle to the grave, in youth Or age, is still unable to digest The ancient leaven of grief, that spreads through all. Oh, well mayest thou give faith to one of us, Who tells thee that this universal life Is suited to the Deity alone: Himself, he dwells in brightness everlasting; Us he hath driven into eternal darkness; For day and night your nature is adapted. Faustus. This daunts not me! Mephistopheles. Said boldly and said well! To me there seems to be one obstacle; Ars longa, vita brevis—the old story— Take a few lessons more—and then determine. Call to your aid some builder up of verses, Let his mind wander in the fields of thought, Imagining high attributes to heap On you—the lion's magnanimity— The fleetness of the stag—the fiery blood That dances in the hearts of Italy— The constancy and firmness of the North— Let his invention gift you with the secret, With lofty thoughts low cunning to combine— To love with all a young heart's ardent impulses, Yet following closely some cold plan of reason— Oh, if I chanced to meet a man, who thus Could reconcile all contrarieties, In truth I know no other name that I Could give him justly, than “Sir Microcosm.” Faustus. What am I, then? if it be thus impossible For man, however he may strive, to win The crown for which his every feeling pants? Mephistopheles. Thou art at last that which thou wert at first— Fix to thy head ten thousand lying curls, Or place thy feet on stilts a cubit high, Still wilt thou end in being what thou art. Faustus. I feel that 'tis in vain I would assume The universal feelings of mankind— Their soul and being;—I must end at last, Feeling within myself no added powers, Not by one hair's breadth higher than before,— As far as ever from the eternal nature! Mephistopheles. You view the thing, good sir, as men view things: This must be made more clear, or we will lose Life's pleasures—what, the vengeance—hands and feet, And head and heart, are thine, confessedly. But are the things which I command, enjoy, And use at will, the less to be called mine? When I behold six horses at my service, Is not their strength, and speed, and vigour, mine? I move as rapidly, and feel, in truth, As if their four-and-twenty limbs were mine. But come, let's haste into society,— Away into the world, and yield ourselves Up to the pleasures which the senses give— I tell thee, that a calculating wretch— Your moralist—your deep philosopher— Is like a beast upon a withered heath, By a bad spirit hurried round and round, In the same grassless circle—while, on all sides, Unseen by him, the bright green pastures shine. Faustus. But how begin? Mephistopheles. First, must we fly from hence— What place of martyrdom is this? what life Is this to lead? or can you call it life, Wearying yourself and pupils thus for ever? Afraid, even in a hint, to intimate Your best acquirements to the boys who crowd Your lecture-room; even now upon the stairs I hear the foot of one. Faustus. Impossible; I cannot see him now. Mephistopheles. The poor lad has been waiting a long while; We should not let him go without some notice; Come now, let me put on your cap and gown, This masquerade dress becomes me charmingly, In a few minutes I'll have done with him; Meanwhile, go you, get ready for our journey! [Faustus exit. (Mephistopheles in Faustus's long gown.) Ay, thus continue to contemn Reason and wisdom, and man's powers, And every hope he can inherit! Still speak despisingly of them, Heart-hardened by an evil spirit; Soul and senses in confusion, Mocked by magical delusion; Still indulge derision vain. Mine thou art, and must remain! What need of seal, or signature In blood, such spirit to secure? His is an eager, restless mind, That presses forward unconfined; And, in the anticipation Of a brisk imagination, Ever active, still outmeasures The slow steps of earthly pleasures: Him, through the world's wild vanity, Its wearisome inanity, Will I hurry forward, thus Breaking his impetuous And fiery temper—he will sprawl, And start, and stand—then stick and fall— Meats and wines unsatisfying Shall before his lips be flying— The withered spirit seeks in vain Health and refreshment to obtain— And though he had not sold it to the devil, A soul like his could not escape from evil. Student enters. Student. I am but just arrived—your name My chief attraction; and I came At once,—forgive my strong desire To see and speak to him, whose fame Has spread so far—whom all admire. Mephistopheles. Fame has been most obliging, then: You see a man like other men— Did you seek farther, you might meet Abler instructors. Student. I entreat Your care and counsel—with a guide Where could I better be supplied? I come with heart and spirits free, And youth—and the professor's fee. My mother scarce would let me come; But I love learning more than home— Have for improvement travelled far— Mephistopheles. And in the best place for it are. Student. And yet, if I the truth may say, I would I were again away: Walls like these, and halls like these, Will, I fear, in no wise please! The narrow gloom of this cold room, Where nothing green is ever seen; No lawn—no tree—no floweret's bloom— 'Mong benches, books, my heart is sinking, And my wasted senses shrinking— I mourn the hour that I came hither; Ear, and eye, and heart will die, Thought, and the power of thought, will wither. Mephistopheles. This is all custom: as at first Unwillingly the young child sips The breast; but soon, with eager thirst, And pressure of delighted lips, Clings to the mother's heart, that gives The living food on which he lives; Thus thou, each day more deeply blest, Wilt drink from Wisdom's nursing breast. Student. Oh, to my heart shall she be strained With love!—but how is she obtained? Mephistopheles. First, let me beg, that you will mention What line of life is your intention? Student. Oh, I long ardently to know Whatever man may learn below, All that we contemplate on earth, And all that in the heaven hath birth, To roam through learning's wondrous maze, And comprehend all nature's ways. Mephistopheles. Right; but by prudence still be guided, Guard most, that thought and mind be not Much dissipated and divided. Student. With soul and strength will I apply, But now and then could seize with pleasure A few short hours of idle leisure, A little thoughtless liberty; A pleasant summer holyday, When skies are bright, and fields are gay. Mephistopheles. Make good use of your time, for fast Time flies, and is for ever past; To make time for yourself begin By order—method—discipline; For this I counsel my young friend A course of logic to attend; Thus will your mind, well-trained, and high, In Spanish boots stalk pompously! With solemn look, and crippled pace, The beaten road of thought will trace: Nor here and there, through paths oblique, In devious wanderings idly strike; Then in long lessons are you taught, That, in the processes of thought, Which hitherto unmarked had gone, Like eating, and like drinking, on, One, Two, and Three, the guide must be In things which were till now so free. But, as the weaver's work is wrought, Even so is formed the web of thought; One movement leads a thousand threads, Unseen they move, as now above The shuttle darts, and now darts under; One beat combines a thousand twines, And, with one blow, at once will go A thousand binding ties asunder. And thus with your philosopher Who teaches wisely to infer— The first was so—the second so— Then must the third and fourth be so— And if the premises be hollow That the conclusion will not follow. Such things charm students every where, But none is a philosopher— For he, who seeks to learn, or gives Descriptions of, a thing that lives, Begins with “murdering, to dissect,” The lifeless parts he may inspect— The limbs are there beneath his knife, And all—but that which gave them life! Alas! the spirit hath withdrawn, That which informed the mass is gone— They scrutinise it, when it ceases To be itself, and count its pieces— Finger and feel them, and call this Experiment—analysis. Is what we handle then the whole? Is there no animating soul? In nature is there nothing meant? No law, no language of intent? Oh! could your chemist, in whose hand The fragments are, but understand The terms he uses! “Encheiresis Naturæ”—for the phrase expresses With scorn, that it seems strange should be In words thus accidentally, How less than nothing can avail These tricks of dabbling and detail. Student. I cannot wholly comprehend your meaning. Mephistopheles. No matter—next time you'll get better on— When you have learned to arrange, and classify, And body all you hear in syllogisms. Student. My brain is stupified—I feel As if, within my head, a wheel Was whirling round with ceaseless reel. Mephistopheles. Next—most important thing of all— With zeal to metaphysics fall. There, see—or think that you see—plain, What—does not pass within the brain. Our faculties are too confined To guide us here—the human mind Fails—and we are and must be blind. Thoughts are or are not in the head,— Use serviceable words instead; But first be sure the next half year At every lecture to appear— Five hours each day for lecturing— Be there the moment the bells ring. Be sure beforehand to prepare, Have read the syllabus with care; Have every paragraph well conned, Watch, lest the teacher go beyond The matter written in his book; Then as you write his dictates, look That you take down verbatim all And every sentence he lets fall, As if each sentence scripture were, That comes from the professor's chair. Student. This, sir, you need not tell me twice— I feel how useful the advice; What one has thus in black and white, He can take home with him at night. Mephistopheles. But what profession is your choice? Student. Law shall not ever have my voice. Mephistopheles. In this, I own, you show discerning: I know, and do not like, this learning. Laws every where are like the taint Of an inherited complaint, The curse of an infected race: Their downward progress you may trace, From land to land, through blighted nations, Afflicting distant generations— Reason made nonsense by their rules, And honesty the badge of fools; Unhappy, that it was thy fate To have been born an age too late. The laws for thy great grandsire made Are laws to thee—must be obeyed— Must be obeyed, and why? Because, Bad though they be, they are the laws; But of the rights by nature taught, And born with man, they take no thought Student. You deepen my abhorrence for That, which I did before abhor— I wish to learn Theology. Mephistopheles. I fear to lead you wrong—and I Speak here with more of hesitation. It is a dangerous vocation, This same Theology: its ways Are such a tangled serpent maze— Such poison every where disguised— And every where as medicine prized— That which is which, or why 'tis so, Few can conjecture—none can know. The best thing that the case affords Is—stick to some one doctor's words: Maintain his doctrines out and out, Admit no qualifying doubt; But stick to words at any rate, Their magic bids the temple gate Of Certainty fly safely ope— Words, words alone, are your best hope. Student. But in each word must be a thought— Mephistopheles. There is, or we may so assume,— Not always found, nor always sought, While words—mere words, supply its room. Words answer well, when men enlist 'em, In building up a favourite system; With words men dogmatise, deceive; With words dispute, on words believe; And be the meaning much or little, The Word can lose nor jot nor tittle. Student. Pardon—I feel my questions tease you Just for a moment more—one word On Medicine, so please you. With but three years for it, it were absurd For one like me, without a guide, To enter on a course so wide; And your experience may suggest, In such a field, what path is best. Mephistopheles (aside). I'm sick of this pedantic tone, Too long assumed. Now for my own! (Aloud.) The trade of medicine's easiest of all: 'Tis but to study all things—every where— Nature and man—the great world and the small— Then leave them at hap-hazard still to fare. It is, you see, plainly impossible That one man should be skilled in every science— Who learns the little that he can, does well: The secret of the art is self-reliance. The best man in his line is he who seizes For his own use each favourable crisis. —You are well made—have common sense, And do not want for impudence. Be fearless—others will confide no less, When you are confident of your success— The only obstacle is indecision; But, above all, win to yourself the women— They have their thousand weaknesses and aches, And the one cure for them is the Physician. A due consideration for the sex Will teach the value of decorous seeming: Let but appearances be unsuspicious, And they are every thing their doctor wishes. The real value of degrees And rank in the profession is, That any character for knowledge You need not take the pains to earn, But by credentials from a college Your patrons all they want may learn, And as in one approved and tried, Unhesitatingly confide. Then in the very earliest stage Of new acquaintanceship you lead them, Enjoying every privilege Of tête-à-tête familiar freedom; Although the young physician's eyes Exhibit half, and half disguise Something, like tenderness, the while Mingling with the habitual guile Of the sly acquiescent smile: Then may you feel the taper wrist, Nor will there one of them resist The hand professionally prest —Permitted boldness—on her breast, Or round her waist the free arm thrown, To feel how much too tight her zone. Student. This seems more feasible—one sees Something like reason in all this— Winning the household through the wife. Mephistopheles. Theory, friend, is old and grey, And green the golden tree of life! Student. Is this reality?—so like a dream All seems! May I, upon some future day, Resume my visit?—learn the grounds and root Of these your doctrines? Mephistopheles. Come when it may suit. Student. One favour more—deem not your guest Intrusive—grant me this request— Just in my album write a line. Mephistopheles. With pleasure. [Writes, and returns the Book. Student (reads). Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum. [Shuts it respectfully, and exit. Mephistopheles. If the wily proverb guide thee, and my cousin the sly snake, A weary man thy likeness to the gods will of thee make! Faustus enters. Where go we now? Mephistopheles. Oh! wheresoe'er you please;— See all that's to be seen in common life, And then, so please you, visit the gay world, Dancing and revelling scot-free, and careless Who pays the piper. Faustus. What, with my long beard? How shall I trim it into decent shape? And I want ease of manners, and the knowledge Of life—why, the experiment must fail! I cannot—never could at any time— Be what society requires: I am Abashed in company—shall every moment Be at a loss! Mephistopheles. My good friend, have no fear On this score—be but self-possessed—that is The only art of life. Faustus. How do you mean To travel?—where are servants? horses? carriage? Mephistopheles. We only spread this mantle out, and it Wafts us through air in this our daring journey. Bring out with you no loads of heavy baggage: A little gas, which I will soon have ready, Will lift us high above the earth;—light laden, We will move fast, and soon be far away! Welcome, my friend, to the new life before you— A pleasant change. I wish you joy of it!</field>

I am lost—bring me cotton! the cheers Will split open my skull, and play hell with my ears. Siebel. When the arches ring again, We feel the bass in full power then. Frosch. Right, right, say I, with all my heart; If any one in evil part Takes any thing, that here is done, Why, kick him out, the bitch's son. Altmayer. A tara—lara—da. Frosch. All throats are tuned. (Sings.) The holy Romish empire now, How does it hold together? Brander. A nasty song—psha!—a political song— A most offensive song. Thank God each day, Rising from bed, that you have nought to say With governing this Romish empire; I Greatly rejoice and bless my stars therefore, I am not Emperor or Chancellor; Still I see no sufficient reason why We should not have a ruler;—I propose That we elect a Pope—what qualification Should mark a candidate for consecration, All of ye know. Frosch (sings). Greet her, Lady Nightingale, Greet my love ten thousand times. Siebel. Love-meetings and greetings—let us not hear of them. Frosch. Love-greetings and meetings—who can keep clear of them? (Sings.) Undo the door in stilly night— Open latch—thy love keeps watch; For thy sake—is he awake, Shut-to the door at morning's light. Siebel. Yes! sing, sing on—a little while sing on! Sing her sweet praises!—I will laugh anon. Me she deceived, and thee she is deceiving, Devil that she is—whom there is no believing— Has played the same tricks with each man that sought her— I wish some goblin of the forest caught her On a cross-road—or that, from the witch-dances On Blocksberg, trotting home, an old buck-goat, With his long-bearded chin and meg-a-geg throat, Made up to her—'tis some such brute she fancies;— A young fellow of proper flesh and blood, To be thus thrown away were far too good; From me no serenading should she gain, Other than dashing in each window-pane. Brander (striking on the table). Silence there—silence—all attend to me— Gentlemen, I know life, and how to live; And, as some of us seem in love to be, A song for love-sick people will I give. Your merry singer is the best physician For a poor devil in such sad condition. Here all of you attend—come, cease your chattering— And listen to a song of the first pattern— And all join in the chorus:— (Sings.) Once in a cellar lived a rat, Whose paunch each day grew smoother; He dined on butter, supped on fat, And looked like Doctor Luther. The cook put poison in his way, And when our poor rat tasted it, He felt a cramping in his heart, As fierce as if Love wasted it. As fierce as if Love wasted it. And he ran round, and out he ran, And looking for a cure, he Drank at each puddle, gnawed, and scratched, And raved in perfect fury. In pain he fell—in pain he sprang, The cook with pleasure gazed at it; Poor creature felt at heart a pang, As fierce as if Love wasted it. As fierce as if Love wasted it. And torture drove him at noon-day To run into the kitchen; He fell down on the hearth, and lay Convulsing there and screeching. Loud laughed the cook to see him sprawl In death, and feel she hasted it: Ha! ha! quoth she, your heart is gone, As sure as if Love wasted it. As sure as if Love wasted it. Siebel. How the heavy logs enjoy it, As if a rat had nothing good, And 'twere a virtue to destroy it. Brander. The rats, it seems, are special favourites; Creatures of generous gentle blood, And hold high place in your good graces. Altmayer. Old baldpate, with the paunch there,—how his wits Are gone!—to him the rat's case his own case is— With food too good for it the belly swollen, Then the poor thing in death convulsions rolling— No wonder it should jar and strike Upon his nerves—it is too like. Mephistopheles and Faustus enter. Mephistopheles (in conversation with Faustus). —And first I feel anxiety, To show you our “Society Of merry fellows;”—free and gay, Regular rioters are they, And their whole life is holiday; The requisites for happiness Are few, are—what these men possess: With lively spirits—self-conceit— And little, very little wit— 'Tis the same life, the whole year round, The self-same set together found;— Each night, their songs—their drink—their game— Their mirth—their very jests the same; And as its tail diverts a kitten, So they with their own jokes are smitten: They ask no more than thus to sup— Without a head-ache to get up— And while the host will credit give Are satisfied—and thus they live! Brander. They're travellers off a journey, you may see it In their odd manners—are not here an hour. Frosch. You're right, quite right! Leipzig, say I, for ever! Leipzig's a little Paris in itself: You'd know our Leipzig people any where. Their manners are so finished. Siebel. But these strangers, What, think you, are they? Frosch. Only wait a moment— In the twinkle of a bumper I will tell you— I'll worm it out of them as easily As draw an infant's tooth: let me alone For managing them: I guess that they belong To the nobility, they look so haughty, So distant,—you would almost say—displeased. Brander. They are mountebanks, I'll lay you any wager. Altmayer. Probably. Frosch. See if I don't screw it out. Mephistopheles (to Faustus). Always the same, they never scent the devil, Even when he has them by the nape of the neck. Faustus. Your servant, gentlemen— Siebel. Thanks, sir, and yours—(Looking at Mephistopheles, in a low tone.) The fellow limps a little on one foot. Mephistopheles. Will you permit us to sit down with you, And for good wine, which cannot be had here, Give us the pleasure of good company? Altmayer. You seem a most fastidious gentleman. Frosch. You are lately come from Rippach, are you not, sirs?— Have been at supper with old Hans to-night? Mephistopheles. To-day we did not stop;—last time we spoke to him He told us some good stories of his cousins— And sent his compliments to each of you. Altmayer. A home thrust that—the fellow's not to be done. Siebel. He knows the world, and how to make out life. Frosch. Wait, wait, until—I'll have him before long. Mephistopheles. Was I deceived, for just as we came in We heard, or thought we heard, a merry chorus Of practised voices?—what a rich effect Music must have along this vaulted roof. Frosch. You are a virtuoso then— Mephistopheles. Oh, no! My skill is next to none—but I love music. Altmayer. Give us a song— Mephistopheles. A hundred, if you please. Siebel. Something original—something brand-new. Mephistopheles. We're just returned from Spain, romantic Spain, The land of wine and song. (Sings.) Once on a time there was a king, A lovely queen had he— But dearer far than queen or son, He loved a big black flea. Frosch. A flea! is it possible I heard him right? A flea! oh, what a guest to grace a palace! [Mephistopheles] Once on a time, there was a king, A lovely queen had he— But dearer far than queen or son, He loved a big black flea! He called the royal tailor, Who measures him, and stitches A coat for the young favourite, And a little pair of breeches. Brander. Forget not, sire, to charge the tailor strictly That they be well and fashionably made— And as he sets a value on his head, That he shall leave no seam, or plait, or wrinkle! Mephistopheles. Of silk and satin were the clothes Our young lord looked so fine in— He sported ribands—and a cross Upon his breast was shining! Soon Minister, he wore a star, Lived splendidly and gaily, His poor relations all got place, And thronged the palace daily. And Queen and Maid got bites and stings, And were afraid to scratch 'em; They cursed the flea and all his kin, But did not dare to catch 'em! But we, if we get sting or bite, None hinders us to scratch 'em; And if the fleas be troublesome, We kill them when we catch 'em. Chorus. —And if, &amp;c. Frosch. Bravo! bravo! that was excellent. Siebel. We'll catch and play the devil with the fleas. Brander. With pointed nail and finger, pressed together. Altmayer. Freedom and Wine for ever!—Wine and Freedom! Mephistopheles. Willingly would I drink long life to Freedom; But that your wines are execrably bad. Siebel. You must not venture to say this again! Mephistopheles. Only I fear to vex our worthy host, I'd give you something better from our cellars. Siebel. Out with it then. I'll take the blame on me. Frosch. Pour out a bumper if you wish to please us— None of your sample thimblefuls for me— When I try wine, I like a deep long draught— That is the only way to judge of it. Altmayer (in a low voice). I've strong suspicions they are from the Rhine. Mephistopheles. Bring me a gimlet. Brander. What to do with it?— You cannot have your wine-casks at the door. Altmayer. Behind, there, is the landlord's chest of tools. Mephistopheles (taking up the gimlet). Now say what wine you wish. Frosch. What do you mean? Have you so many? Mephistopheles. Each may choose his favourite. Altmayer (to Frosch). Ha! you begin to lick your lips already. Frosch. Well then, if I may choose, I'll take the Rhenish: The best gifts we receive are from our country. Mephistopheles (boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite Frosch's seat). Now get a little wax—and make some stoppers. Altmayer. 'Tis plain that they are jugglers. Mephistopheles (to Brander). Sir, your choice? Brander. I'll have Champagne—sparkling Champagne for me! [Mephistopheles bores again; one of the party has in the mean time prepared the wax stoppers and stopped the gimlet holes. Brander. One cannot always do without the Foreigner— But give him to me in the shape of wine. A true-born German hates with all his heart A Frenchman—but their wines are excellent. Siebel (as Mephistopheles approaches his seat). I'd have you know I hate all acid wines— Give me a glass of genuine sweet! Mephistopheles. Tokay Then let it be. Altmayer. No, gentlemen, this won't do! Now look me straight in the face, old mountebank: I see you but bamboozle us!— Mephistopheles. Yes! yes! A very likely story—to play tricks On noble guests like you! now fast—make ready— Out with the word—pray, sir, what shall I give you?— Altmayer. Any and all! whatever I can get. (After all the holes are bored and stopped, Mephistopheles, with strange gestures.) Grapes are of the vine-branch born; The buck-goat's is a branch of horn Wine is sap—and grapes are wood, The wooden board yields wine as good. All is clear to him that seeth— Lift the veil and look beneath, It is but a deeper glance Under Nature's countenance— Now behold—your prophet saith— Miracles—if you have faith. Every man draw up his stopper, And drink such wine as he thinks proper. All (as they draw the stoppers, and the wine each has chosen runs into his glass). Flow on, bright rill—flow on and fill Our hearts with joy—flow on at will! Mephistopheles. Drink—but be cautious how you spill: There's danger if a drop but falls. [They drink repeatedly. All (sing). That we will—that we will!— Happy as the cannibals: Like five hundred swine we swill. Mephistopheles. Look at them, they're the happiest of men. Faustus. Take me away—I'll not come here again. Mephistopheles. Wait till you see them in their glory: We'll soon have fun! Siebel (drinking carelessly, spills some of the wine, which turns to flame). Help, help! fire, fire!—Hell fire! Mephistopheles. Down, friendly Element!—be still, I say— —This time 'twas but a drop of purgatory! Siebel. What means the fellow? Damn him—he shall pay Dearly for this: you'd think he did not know us. Frosch (to Mephistopheles). Better take care no tricks like this to show us. Altmayer. The sooner we get rid of him the better— There's nothing to be had from such a debtor. Siebel. You, sir, are guilty of strange impropriety; Playing your mountebank pranks in such society. Mephistopheles. Silence, old wine-tub! Siebel. Broomstick! one would think He might rest satisfied with these feats of his, Without being impudent into the bargain. Brander. Be silent, and thankful that we do not flog you! Altmayer (draws a stopper out of the table; fire flies out). I'm burnt—I'm burning! Siebel. Kill him—kill the scoundrel! He's a magician!—Kill him! he's fair game! [They draw their knives and attack Mephistopheles. Mephistopheles (with solemn gestures). Wandering voices mock the ear! Forms, that phantoms are, appear! Be ye far away, and near! Be ye there! and be ye here! [They stand gazing on each other in amazement. Altmayer. Where am I?—in what lovely land? Frosch. What a show of vineyards near! Siebel. Clustering grapes invite the hand. Brander. See them through the green leaves here— Ripe and heavy—look at them;— Oh! what grapes—and such a stem! [He seizes Siebel by the nose. The others do the same one with the other, and are raising their knives. Mephistopheles (as from above). Clouds of Error pass away! See ye how the Devil can play! Let each startled reveller See who plays the Devil here. [Vanishes with Faustus. The fellows start back from one another. Siebel. What's this? Altmayer. How's this? Frosch. Is this your nose? Brander (to Siebel). And yours, on which my fingers close? Altmayer. I feel the shock through every limb; A chair!—I faint!—my eyes grow dim! Frosch. What is the matter with you all? Siebel. Where is he? what's become of him? If I can catch him, how I shall— Altmayer. Catch him, indeed! 'tis easy trying To deal with such—I saw him flying Out of the cellar on a cask— You may as well give up the task: Cold, cold as lead these feet of mine Are grown.—(Turning towards the table.) We've lost our well of wine. Siebel. All was deception—trick—design! Frosch. Yet, what I drank, I thought was wine! Brander. The ripe grapes too—did they deceive? —Who after this can but believe?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WITCH'S KITCHEN. On a low hearth a large caldron is on the fire—in the thick smoke are discovered several strange figures. A female Cat-ape is sitting beside the caldron, to skim it, and take care it does not boil over. The male Cat-ape, with the young ones, sits near, warming himself;—fantastic articles of furniture, suitable to the place, seen hanging from the walls, &amp;c. Faustus and Mephistopheles. Faustus. This senseless witchcraft sickens and disgusts me— And, sayest thou that I shall recruit life's powers, Here, in this loathsome den of filthy madness?— Shall I petition an old hag for counsel? And can the nauseous puddle of that pot Make me a younger man by thirty winters? There's little hope if thou hast nothing better— My expectation is already gone! —Is there in Nature no restorative But this? Has Spirit never yet devised Means different to restore the spring of life? Mephistopheles. Now do I recognise my friend's good sense;— Yes! there are also natural means, by which Life's bloom and vigour may again be given; But in a different book this lesson lies, And it forms an odd chapter. Faustus. I will learn it. Mephistopheles. There is a means, and it requires not gold, Magic, or medicine;—away with you Into the fields—begin to hew and delve— Confine yourself, and limit every wish Within a narrow circle—feed upon Meats, simple, undisguised—and live, in short, Beast-like, 'mong beasts—deem it no degradation Thyself to spread the dung upon the field, The growth of which thou art to reap—this is Indeed the best way to repair life's powers, And wear at eighty a hale countenance. Faustus. This cannot be—I am not used to it— Nor can I learn to take up now the spade— Such narrow life would never do for me. Mephistopheles. We must recur then to the witch. Faustus. Why so? —What's the particular use of an old hag In the matter? Can't you cook the draught yourself? Mephistopheles. That were a pretty waste of time—why, man, A thousand bridges might be built, before 'Tis done—it asks not skill and science only, But patience must brood over it—the spirit In silence must remain for years fermenting; Time, and time only, clears and strengthens it,— All things belonging to it are mysterious— Its powers and its ingredients wonderful— True—'twas the devil that first invented it, But yet the devil can't make it—look—look, yonder— What a handsome crew they are—both maid and man.— (To the Apes.) It seems the mistress is from home. The Apes. Gone from home—to the rout, Through the chimney she went out; Gone to carouse On the chimney stone on the top of the house! Mephistopheles. Will she stay Long away? Apes. 'Twixt the time she comes and goes, We can scarcely warm our toes. Mephistopheles. What think you of these dear young creatures? Faustus. All makes me sick—voice, form, and features! Mephistopheles. Well, I must own, I greatly relish The graces which their style embellish. [To the Apes. Tell me, execrable baby, What the mess you mingle may be— And the lumps, my pretty jewel! That are floating in the gruel. Apes. A beggar's dish—we boil and stew it. Mephistopheles. And most men, without knowing, chew it. Old Ape (fawning upon Mephistopheles). Throw the dice—begin, begin— I am poor, so let me win— Me to win, and you to lose, Is the way that I would choose— Money's all in all;—the witch Is made honest, if made rich. Give me gold, and by that rule, Who will say I am a fool? Mephistopheles. As the Ape talks of gold, see his lips growing watery, I wish we could get him a share in the Lottery. The Old Ape (while the young Cat-apes are playing and rolling round a large bowl). Such is the world! So is it twirled, Now rolling onward, Now rolling downward, Ceaselessly, restlessly, Still does it spin; Like glass it is brittle, And broken by little, Glimmering, shimmering, Hollow within— Living am I— Stop, my dear son, Thy sporting have done, Think thou must die! All is clay, And must crumble away! Mephistopheles. What's the purpose of the sieve? Ape. If a man comes here to thieve, With this eye-glass thus we view him; Raise it thus, and thus look through him. [Runs to the Female, and makes her look through it at Mephistopheles. Through the sieve look there—look strait— Read his features—read his fate. Answer, if thou art not deaf— Dost thou know him—the old thief? Dost thou dread, from fear or shame, To name him by his proper name? Mephistopheles. And what's the meaning of the pot? Ape. How silly a sot, To ask what's what; The fool knows not The use of the pot— The use of the kettle— Mephistopheles. Unmannerly wittol, Be quiet a little. Ape. Be brisk—take the whisk,—and sit down on the settle. [Forces Mephistopheles to sit down. Faustus (who has been all this time before a glass, now approaching, and now standing off from it). What is this that I see—how heavenly fair The form that shines in this enchanted glass! Oh! lend me, Love, thy swift and silent wings, That I may fly away to where she is! Near me she seems, yet hopelessly removed, And living in another atmosphere! Alas! if from this spot I do but stir, If I but venture to approach more near, There seems a dusky cloud to gather o'er her;— Image of woman, beyond woman fair, Oh! beautiful transcendently—has Earth Charms such as this—in that reclining form, Say rather that all charms of many heavens United are.—Can this indeed be woman? Can this, indeed, be a created being? Mephistopheles. Fine cause of wonderment!—after seven days Of work, if he who made this pretty world, And who admired his workmanship, made something Worth looking at! Ay, gaze on her in rapture— This, by the way, is one of these same treasures That I am pretty safe in promising: Blessed the man who brings the fair bride home! [Faustus continues looking into the glass— Mephistopheles, lolling on the settle, and with the whisk in his hand, continues speaking. Here on my kingly throne I sit me down, With sceptre too—I only want a crown. The Apes (who have been playing all kind of fantastic gambols, bring Mephistopheles a crown with loud acclamations). Monarch proud— With sweat and blood Smear it—wear it— [They handle the crown awkwardly, and break it in two pieces, with which they go dancing about. 'Tis done—'twas to be; We speak and we see— We hearken—we listen— We rhyme and we reason. Faustus (still before the glass). Alas! I feel my senses leaving me. Mephistopheles. And stranger still, even my head's growing giddy! Apes. We have words, and we can link Syllables that chime and chink; Sense unsought—thus is caught;— Every jingle is a thought— Every word with meaning fraught— Language, glib and random, thus Does the work of thought for us; Let but your own fancy mingle With the jargon and the jingle, As you listen to the lays; Bring the meaning you are gleaning, Give the poet all the praise. Faustus (as before). My heart's on fire—let us depart. Mephistopheles. This is the true poetic art— And I have never met with prettier poets, Could they but keep the secrets of their trade. [The caldron, which the female Cat-ape has forgotten to attend to, begins to boil over— a great blaze arises, and streams up the chimney. —The Witch comes down through the flame, with horrid screams. The Witch. Ou! Ou! Ou! Ou! Damned beast! cursed sow!— The pot has boiled over—the broth's overturned, The liquor is lost, and the Mistress is burned! Damned beast— And what is this? [Seeing Faustus and Mephistopheles. And who are ye? What brings ye here? Who sent ye here? May fiery pain Burn bone and brain! [Dips the skimming ladle in the caldron, and sprinkles the flames at Faustus, Mephistopheles, and the Cat-apes—the Apes whine. Mephistopheles (flourishes the fan, and breaks pots and glasses). Broken, broken! Hell-broth splashing, Glasses crashing, Payment for the words you've spoken! It is all in sport, my honey! Nothing but a frolic funny! Keeping time, old carrion odious, Fitly with thy voice melodious! [The Witch steps back with rage and astonishment. Knowest thou no more than that o'me, Thou raw-boned old Anatomy! Skeleton! the devil blast her! —Know you not your Lord and Master? Shall I dash the old deceiver's Bones into a thousand shivers? Smash her, and cats, and crocks together? —Know ye not my vest's red leather? Know ye not the cock-tail feather? What mask is there upon my features, To hide me thus from my own creatures? —And am I called upon to mention My name, my rank, and my pretension? The Witch. Pardon, my Lord, this rough salute; I do not see the cloven foot,— And where are your two ravens?—Where— Mephistopheles. Enough, old fool,—for once I spare;— 'Tis long since we have met, and strange Has been, in such a time, the change— The world's grown wise—in every movement Is seen the Spirit of Improvement; Reform to every thing extended— Among the rest the devil is mended; For court has left his wildernesses, Thrown off his ancient savage dresses; The curling tail and talons horrid, And horns to guard the wrinkled forehead. All gone—the northern phantom's vanished, By modern education banished! —As to the foot—against my will, I bear that witness with me still; 'Twould injure me in the good graces Of some who figure in high places; So, what I can, I do to hide it, And for the purpose, am provided With padded calves—and thus am able To limp no more than's fashionable— Many young men, that I might mention, Avail themselves of the invention. The Witch. Satan again—my own old boy, Once more with me!—I'll die with joy. Mephistopheles. Woman, that name—I beg to be excused— Call me not so again. The Witch. And why? and wherefore? what the mischief ails The good old name? Mephistopheles. It has been too much used, And sounds like something in the fairy tales; Is so familiar, that men deem it fable; Men believe nothing now above the level Of every-day experience—they are able To disprove all things;—don't believe a letter That speaks of me,—are they for this the better? —Devils that they are, they don't believe a devil! Call me Lord Baron—no one can object To that, or some such title of respect. I am a cavalier, as good As any—am of ancient blood; Look at my scutcheon, all who doubt it— See here—I never go without it. [Struts about with pompous gestures. The Witch (laughing immoderately). Ha! ha!—this is so like you—is so clever— You're after all, the same gay rascal ever! Mephistopheles (to Faustus.) This, every day's experience teaches, Is the true way to deal with witches. The Witch. What, gentlemen, would you desire To drink? Mephistopheles. I thank you—we require A bumper—one will be enough— Of—you know well the right old stuff. Give us the oldest you have here. (To Faustus.) Its strength is doubled every year! The Witch. Most willingly—you need not ask A second time—here is a flask, I taste myself, now and again— You'll not find any smell remain. Here—take a dram—but if I give it To him—you know he can't outlive it An hour, unless some charm protect His life from the assured effect. Mephistopheles. He is a friend, 'twill do him good— Thrives like yourself on witches' food— There's nothing you can give that is Too strong for such a stomach as his. Come—chalk your circle—chant your charm— Fill high the cup, 'twill do no harm. [The Witch, with extraordinary gestures, describes a circle, and places strange things within it. Meantime the glasses begin to chime and ring; the caldron to sound and make music. Lastly, she brings a great book, places the Cat-Apes within the circle; one is made to serve her for a reading-desk, others hold torches. She signs to Faustus to approach. Faustus (to Mephistopheles). No, no! I'm sick of the whole scene! What good is it? what can it mean? These raving gestures? and this rapid Torrent of nonsense? filthy—vapid And loathsome cheat.—I've seen such stuff Before; and hated it enough! Mephistopheles. 'Tis pure professional farce—mere fudge— You should not be so hard a judge! She is but acting the physician; This hocus-pocus exhibition Assists the cure—makes the draught operate With good effect, and at the proper rate. [She makes Faustus enter the circle. The Witch (with a strong emphasis, begins to declaim from the book). Understand me let all men! Of One make Ten, Let Two go then: Bid Three Now be The square of Three: Thus the Witch Makes you rich: Drop Four From your score: From Five and Six You should fix To take Seven and Eight, Then all is complete. And Nine is One, And Ten is None, This is the Witch's One-times-one. Faustus. She seems in earnest, old deceiver! —How like the ravings of a fever! Mephistopheles. There is an endless volume of this stuff— I ought to know it—I've lost time enough Puzzling it out—for downright contradiction Is, to the wise and fools, an equal mystery. My friend, in the old almanack of history, You'll find such jumbles made of fact and fiction; And by the help of this, or some such juggle, Errors spread wide;—truth suffers in the struggle. Doctrines are lisped by infants; taught in schools, And are believed: for who contends with fools? To customary words men still will link Their faith—poor dolts—imagining they think! Witch. The height, the might, Of wisdom's light, The knowledge from the wide world hidden, Cheers humblest minds: Who seeks not finds: The welcome guest is the unbidden. Faustus. This nonsense, so like meaning, splits My skull. I soon would lose my wits: Methinks, a million fools in choir Are raving and will never tire. Mephistopheles. Enough! enough! incomparable sibyl! Hand us the drink—fill the cup to the brim— No thimblefulls for us—no niggard dribble— Fear not—such draught will never injure him, He is one of us, and of the highest grade: Has drunk deep before now—be not afraid! [The Witch, with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a cup: as Faustus raises it to his mouth, a light flame rises. Off with it fast—why should you fear it? —Once down 'twill warm your heart and cheer it. How's this? my friend, and much the same As one of us—afraid of flame? [The Witch dissolves the circle. Faustus steps out. Mephistopheles (to Faustus). Now! out at once! you must not rest! Witch (to Faustus). Much good may it do! (Aside.) I hope the best! Mephistopheles (to the Witch). If I can serve you, sure you might Command me, on Walpurgis night. The Witch. Here is a song—a pretty glee. Hum it a few times,—you will see Some merit in it, and effect More than you would at first expect. Mephistopheles (to Faustus). Come, quick! be for the present guided! This draught will do you good, provided It gets fair play; but it requires Brisk motion till the frame perspires, And its full force is felt to dart At once through each and every part. And then, not sooner, will I teach What joys the lazy hand can reach, Of indolent voluptuousness. The pleasures that our nobles bless;— Soon in thy cheery heart, I trow, Will Cupid rock him to and fro. Already the young urchin lurks Within, and in the spirit works. Faustus. Once more!—one other look into the glass!— Fair form—too fair more than a form to be! Mephistopheles. Come! come! no form the beauties can surpass, That soon in living woman thou shalt see! (Aside.) With this draught in him he will meet A Helena in every street!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE STREET. Faustus (to Margaret passing on). Fair lady, may I offer you my arm; And will you suffer me to see you home? Margaret. I am no lady—and I am not fair. I want no guide to show me the way home. [Disengages herself, and exit. Faustus. By Heaven, she is a lovely child; A fairer never met my eye, Modest she seems, and good and mild, Though something pert was her reply— The red lips bright—the cheek's soft light— My youth hath not departed quite! She passed, her timid eyes declining, Deep in my heart they still are shining— And her light spirits' lively play Hath stolen me from myself away! Mephistopheles enters. Faustus. Hearken here, sir, get me the girl; and fast. Mephistopheles. The girl!—what girl?— Faustus. She that this moment passed. Mephistopheles. What—she? she was but now at church At her confession—I was there. And, hid by the confession chair, Was listening to her from my lurch. Poor thing—she is all innocence— Had nothing in the world to tell! With such to meddle is not well. Her purity is a defence, That leaves the tempter no pretence. Upon this child I have no power. Faustus. She's past fourteen, if she's an hour! Mephistopheles. Could Liederlich be worse than this? The profligate, whose folly is, To think each flower of beauty his. Calls it a purchasable trifle, And every charm he sees would rifle; Thinks truth and honour but a name— My friend, give up this hopeless game. Faustus. Sound doctrine this, most reverend, I hope your sermon's at an end: Now, once for all, conceited fellow, I am determined on't, and tell you, She must, this very night, be mine: You and I part, if you decline. Mephistopheles. Compose yourself—be reasonable— If in a fortnight I be able To make out opportunities! Faustus. A fortnight! give me but seven hours! I want no devil to help me then, And ask no aid from any powers But those belonging to all men, To fool a child like this with ease, And make her any thing I please. Mephistopheles. How like a Frenchman! I regret To see you discontented yet: Why thus impatient? the delight Is, after all, less exquisite, Than when with some delay and doubt, And difficulty fenced about, You win the treasure guarded long; Play with the pretty thing awhile, And toy and trifle and beguile, And to your will the soft wax mould,— As witness many a story told, Of true love in Italian song. Faustus. But, fortunately, I require No such incentives to desire. Mephistopheles. Now, not to take or give offence, Believe me, here all violence Is useless—in a little while The damsel may be won by guile;— A stratagem, perhaps, may gain The fortress—storming it were vain! Faustus. Give me, meanwhile, some little thing Of hers—a garter or a ring— A kerchief from her snowy breast— Show me the chamber of her rest! Mephistopheles. To prove how sensibly I feel Your pangs, and, if I could, to heal; I gratify, without delay, Your wish, and take you there to-day. Faustus. And shall I see her? have her? Mephistopheles. No! She to a neighbour's has to go, And when I find that she is gone, You may indulge yourself alone; Breathe in the very room where she Hath slept, and dream of joys to be. Faustus. May we go now? Mephistopheles. It scarce were pleasant So early. Faustus. Make me out some present. Mephistopheles. Presents so soon! this promises Speedy success—they all love dress! Oh, I know many a place of pleasure, Where such things are, and many a treasure Buried of old, and soon will find Some lure to win the young thing's mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EVENING. A NEAT LITTLE ROOM. Margaret. I would give something now to know The gentleman who met me, though; He had a proud and princely air, Is one of the nobility; Look on his brow, you read it there, And if he were not, he would stare With somewhat more civility. [Exit. Mephistopheles and Faustus. Mephistopheles. Come in—tread softly—but come in. Faustus (after a pause). Leave me, now leave me, I entreat. Mephistopheles (prying about). The place is tidy and quite clean; —Not every damsel's is so neat. [Exit. Faustus (looking round). How calm! how happy dwells the tender light In this still sanctuary reposing here, And the sweet spirit of peace pervading all, And blessing all.—Spirit of peace and love, I give myself to thee! Oh, love, whose breath Is fed on the delicious dew of hope, Be thou henceforth my life! How round us breathe In every thing the same prevailing quiet And neatness, and the feeling of contentment! —In low estate what more than riches are, And this poor cell how very, very happy! [He throws himself on the leathern arm-chair beside the bed. Receive me, thou who hast with open arm, Year after year, the generations gone Welcomed in joy and grief: how many a swarm Of children round this patriarchal throne Have gathered here! perhaps beside this seat— I well can fancy it—a happy child —Even now she scarce is more—at Christmas eve, My love has knelt down at her grandsire's feet, Among the children grouping to receive The Christmas gifts, with pleasure undefiled, Kissing the good old man I see her stand, Her young round cheeks prest on his withered hand. The spirit of contentment, maiden dear, Is breathing in thy very atmosphere; I feel it sway me while I linger here. The sense of neatness, felt in every thing, Speaks with a mother's voice, and bids thee spread The little table with its covering, The floor with clean sand crackling to the tread. Every where round the hand beloved I trace, That makes a paradise of any place. Here could I linger hours on hours, Where dreams and meditative thought, And, nature, thy benignant powers Within her virgin bosom wrought, As day by day each influence pure, Of heaven and earth her heart mature, And fain would welcome forth, and win To light, the angel from within. Here lay the slumbering child, her tender breast Filled with the warmth of happy life; and here The heavenly image, on the soul imprest, Came out, as clouds past off, divinely clear. But thou, accursed, what art thou? What brings thee to her chamber now? Alas! I tremble but to think, And feel my heart within me shrink. Poor Faustus! has some magic cloud Befooled thine eyes? thy reason bowed? Else why this burning passion strange? And why to love this sudden change? Oh man—unstable, erring, blind, The plaything of the passing wind! And, should she now return and meet Thee here, how would the boaster shrink Into the coward! at her feet In what confusion sink! Mephistopheles (entering). Away—I see her at the door. Faustus. I go, and I return no more. Mephistopheles. This casket, with its jewels rare, I got it—but no matter where— Or—what was to be given instead,— Some things are better left unsaid;— I've brought them for you—don't forget To place them in her cabinet. On her imagination seizing, They soon will lull to rest her reason: Then, guess you, how the dream will end. I got them for another friend: The casket and the trifles in it He thought might buy a happy minute; And he was one who knew the fashion In which to woo, and woman's passion; But child is child, and maid and lover Play the same game the wide world over. Faustus. I know not; ought I? Mephistopheles. Can you ask it? Perhaps you wish to keep the casket; If so—and that 'tis avarice— I wish you joy of this cheap vice; I'm glad the momentary bubble Of love has burst—it saves me trouble; And easier pastimes you may find Than practising upon her mind. My poor brain scarcely understands What you are at—I rub my hands And scratch my head. [Places the casket in the press, and closes the lock. Away—come quick— Soon shall this young one, fancy-sick, Think often of you—wish and will All to one object pointing still; And there are you,—as starched and dull As if 'twere your old lecture-room, And the two sisters beautiful, Physics and Metaphysics, whom You loved so long, were standing there, With their hagged faces and grey hair, In person by the doctor's chair. Come, come. [Exeunt. Enter Margaret (with a lamp). Margaret. It feels so close, so sultry here, Yet out of doors I thought it chill. —When will my mother come? A thrill Runs through my frame—I am, I fear, A foolish, foolish woman. [She begins to sing as she undresses herself. There was a king in Thulé, And he loved an humble maid; And she who loved him truly, When she came to her death-bed, A golden cup she gave him, Which none could better prize; And ever, as he drank of it, Tears dimmed his flowing eyes. And when he came to die, To his heirs his wealth he told; Left all without a sigh But his mistress' cup of gold. As at the royal banquet Among his knights sate he, In the high hall of his fathers, In their fortress o'er the sea, Up stood the gay old monarch; For the last time up he stood; For the last time drained the blessed cup, And threw it in the flood. He saw it falling, filling, And sinking in the sea; His eyes lost sight of it, and sank, And never more drank he. [She opens the press to put in her clothes, and perceives the casket. How came this brilliant casket here? I locked the press, I'd almost swear. The cover's beautiful—I wonder What it may be that lies under? Some pledge for money by my mother Lent to somebody or other. I think I'll open it—and, see, Attached to it, and tempting me, A riband with a little key. How very beautiful it is! I've never seen the like of this! Jewels and pearls!—At mask or ball 'Twould grace the proudest dame of all Who glitter at high festival. I wonder how 'twould look on me? Whose can the glorious splendour be? [She puts them on, and stands before the glass. Oh, if I had these ear-rings only! Drest thus, I seem a different creature! What good are charms of form and feature Though poor maids are both mild and fair, The world for ever leaves them lonely— Man may praise, Yet half he says Seems less like kindness than compassion— For gold he strives, For gold he wives— Alas! the poor are not in fashion!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROMENADE. Faustus walking up and down in thought—to him Mephistopheles. By Love, which I contemn, and Hell's Essence of fire—things can't be worse: Oh, that I could be something else Than what I am, that I might curse! Faustus. What ails thee now? What pinches thee so sore? A face like that I never saw before. Mephistopheles. I'd damn myself to everlasting evil, But that I am myself the devil. Faustus. This frantic scene—what can it mean? Mephistopheles. Think, only think, that splendid set Of pearls, procured for Margaret, A priest has made his own of them. The mother, soon as she detected The treasure, something wrong suspected. The old hag o'er her book of prayer Sits moping, mumbling, grumbling there, Or, snuffling with suspicious nose, Exploring through the house she goes, On the scent, to ascertain What is holy, what profane. Curse her! she smelt no good event From Margaret's rich ornament. “My child,” she said, “things thus unholy, Or suited not for one so lowly, Will seize and fasten on the heart, And hold it till health, peace, depart. To the Virgin Mary bring These in humble offering;— Sinful things of earth we give, And receive from Heaven, instead, Heaven's own food restorative, That our precious souls may live Fed on manna—angels' bread!” At this poor Madge looked far from pleasant, Provoked at having lost the present: Why, thought she, is the gift rejected? Or he, who gave it me, suspected? The giver is a rich man—must Be generous—and therefore just And good—and why should we distrust? The mother strait sends for the priest; He comes, and he enjoys the jest. His features brighten up with rapture, And thus he preaches o'er his capture:— “You feel the matter right, dear madam; These pearls—'twere wrong the poor child had 'em: To them who strive is grace accorded, And he who conquers is rewarded. The Church will feel (we cannot question) No difficulty of digestion; Will swallow without fear of surfeit The ill-got goods that sin makes forfeit; Whole realms, their produce and their profit, She eats up, and thinks nothing of it: The Church alone, with conscience quiet, Can thrive upon this doubtful diet.” Faustus. That this is false each day evinces, Or true as well of Jews and princes. Mephistopheles. On this, he swept into his pocket Ear-rings and bracelet, chain and locket, And made no more of pearls and casket, Than if he pocketed a basket Of nuts,—then treats them with a lecture On vanity,—states his conjecture Upon the uses of affliction, And leaves them with his benediction. Faustus. And Margaret— Mephistopheles. Sits in restless mood— Does nothing—knows not what she should— Thinks night and day on what she lost, But dwells on him who gave them most. Faustus. Poor thing! her grief goes to my heart! Bring her more jewels—come—be smart— The first, coarse common things were they. Mephistopheles (in affected vexation). Mere trinkets flung in sport away! —My toil is nothing, nor the value Of what I give!— Faustus. Be silent—shall you Thus mock at me and my affection? Act for my ends, by my direction. Court thou the widow—tax invention For sweet things—draw off her attention— Come—come—you're dull as water gruel,— Up—up—away for chain and jewel! Mephistopheles. My lord, I cheerfully obey. [Faustus exit. How a man fooled with love will fling away Sun, stars, earth, heaven, upon the chosen lady— All cheap as presents to a child on May-day! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE. Martha (alone). God help and pity me, and pardon My poor old man! he treats me badly;— Thus to go off—'tis very hard on A wedded wife,—here pining sadly Am I upon my lonely straw. I loved and doted on him so, His very will to me was law; And for no reason thus to go And die abroad (weeping)—he must have died— Yet 'twould be satisfactory If I could have it certified. Enter Margaret. Margaret. Martha. Martha. What can the matter be? Margaret. My knees are sinking under me. I've found another casket, one Like that so lately had and gone, Laid in my press—of ebony— The rings and jewels in it are More brilliant than the former far. Martha. Your mother must not hear it, though, Or straitway to the priest they go. Margaret. Look at them, only look at them. Martha. Fortunate girl. Margaret. Alas, one gem I cannot—can I?—ever dare Put on in church or any where. Martha. Come here as often as you please, And try them on where no one sees: Before the glass be whole hours spent Adjusting every ornament. We will enjoy their full effect, With none your secret to suspect; Then as occasions come, a ball, A dance, a day of festival, We let them one by one appear— A chain, a pearl-drop in the ear— And coin some story or another To keep the matter from your mother. Margaret. Twice to have had such caskets brought, There's something in it more than ought! [A knock. Good God! my mother! I'll be seen. Martha. 'Tis a strange gentleman.—Come in. Mephistopheles (enters). I've come unceremoniously; But, ladies, you will pardon me. [Retreats respectfully before Margaret. To Mrs. Schwerdtlein was my visit: I'm told this is her lodging. Is it? Martha. Sir, I'm the person. What's your pleasure? Mephistopheles. I'll call when you are more at leisure: You have a guest of consequence; I'll call again in three hours hence. Martha (to Margaret). The funniest thing I ever knew— The gentleman imagined you To be some lady of high rank. I can't but laugh. Margaret. I have to thank The gentleman's extreme good nature. I am a poor young humble creature: These ornaments are not my own. Mephistopheles. I did not judge by them alone; 'Tis something in your mien and glance. —My visit was a lucky chance. Martha (aside). To know what brings him, I am dying. Mephistopheles. I wish I had news more gratifying; But blame me not, though sad it prove. Your husband's dead, and sends his love. Martha. Is dead! the faithful creature dead! My husband—would 'twere I instead. Margaret. Friend, let thy strong good sense prevail O'er grief— Mephistopheles. And hear the full detail. Margaret. I fear at all to think of love, Such loss my certain death would prove. Mephistopheles. Grief waits on joy—joy follows grief. Martha. Tell on; it will be some relief. Mephistopheles In Padua, at St. Anthony's, In consecrated earth he lies! A cool bed under the church floor, Where he sleeps soundly. Martha. Nothing more? Mephistopheles. Oh, yes! a death-bed legacy: His last commission was to thee, To have three hundred masses said, With requiem service for the dead. His last was a religious thought: This is the whole of what I brought. Martha. What, not a coin, no trinket token, Nothing to soothe his poor heart-broken? Why, the most paltry artisan, The veriest wretch in form of man, Some small memorial still will hoard, Some little pledge in secret stored, To show his love is not forgot— Will starve—will beg—but parts it not! Mephistopheles. Madam, I'm sorry for his blindness To the true value of your kindness: 'Tis your mistake, to think he squandered His money—as he died, he pondered The past—and, as his heart relented, His sins and his bad luck repented. Margaret. Unhappy men! I weep for them! He shall not want my requiem! Mephistopheles. Oh, what an angel she will prove, —So kind, so good,—in wedded love! Margaret. Time long enough 'twill be till then. Mephistopheles. You'll find admirers 'mong the men: If not a husband, yet some lover Will soon these ripening charms discover: Heaven gives us nothing better here Than clasping one so loved, so dear. Margaret. 'Tis not the custom of the place. Mephistopheles. Custom or not, it is the case. Martha. Tell on. Mephistopheles. I stood at his bedside; The rotting straw on which he died, Something less foul than dung, not much, Infectious to the smell and touch.— He died a Christian, and in debt, Settled his scores with Heaven;—the trifle Due at the gin-shop, is due yet. “Alas,” said he, “I used my wife ill.— “Would die at peace, did she forgive.” Martha. Poor man! I long ago forgave. Mephistopheles. “But 'twas her folly, as I live!” Martha. What! standing on the very grave Did he say this? assert this lie? And did he tell you it was I, I who was wrong?— Mephistopheles. He did: but out The truth has come, and leaves no doubt. He lied: your very countenance Decides the matter at a glance!— “Mine was hard work, you may conjecture, (Thus ran his peevish death-bed lecture,) “First, all her children to be fed; “And while I toiled to make them bread, “Not let to eat my crust in peace.” Martha. What, will his slanders never cease? Love, Honour, Truth, forgotten quite; Our tendernesses day and night. Mephistopheles. Not so: he thought of you with great affection. “As I,” said he, “was late from Malta sailing, “I found myself in prayer; a sudden rapture, “Following a burst of tender recollection “Of wife and children, and the prayer prevailing “Was heard on high. That day we made a capture; “A Turkish vessel laden with rich treasure “For the great sultan: 'twas a gallant fight, “And valour triumphed, and was well rewarded: “And when they came the shares of each to measure, “I got, to say the least of it, my right.” Martha. What? how? a prize? think you, he buried it? Mephistopheles. Who knows where heaven's four winds have scattered it? Bury it?—no, his heart was far from sordid: That his death proves, his generous nature hurried it. A lady, one of your nice Neapolitans, As he was loitering in their pleasant city, Looked on his loneliness, kind soul, with pity, And saw his vanity—and soothed and flattered it— Fastened upon him, led him such a jolly dance, That with his cash, and him, all was soon over. Marks of affection, too, she gave her lover, Of such a kind, that to the blessed hour In which your poor saint died, he felt their power. Martha. Scoundrel, to use his wife and children so! Ought not the poverty, which his neglect Had heaped on us, his shameless course have checked? Mephistopheles. It ought; and he is punished for it now: But as this will not mend the case, I would, if I were in your place, Put on my mourning, keep a good eye out, And wed again, when the year came about. Martha. Where could I find, in this wide world of men, Any thing like my own poor man again? There could not be a creature kinder, fonder; His only fault was his desire to wander: And when I think of him, my eyes are swimming: He was so good, without a single vice, Except his taste for foreign wines and women, And the society they bring—and dice. Mephistopheles. Well! if on his side he had only made Allowances as just and generous, Your quarrels had been easily allayed. Why, I myself—if you indulge me thus— With such good sense—in a few little things— Am tempted to propose exchanging rings. Martha. Oh, Sir, you are a pleasant gentleman:— Sure you were speaking but in jest. Mephistopheles. I'd best be off: this vile old pest Has her brains turned already with the plan Of marrying me at once outright! My only safety is in flight. Damn her! she'll keep the devil to his word. [To Margaret. How goes it with your heart? Margaret. What means my lord? Mephistopheles (as if to himself). —The good sweet innocent child! (Aloud.) Ladies, farewell! Margaret. Farewell! Martha. Sir! Sir! don't leave us till you tell One little matter more: I want a witness To prove his death and burial—how—when—where— Formally proved; and you will see the fitness Of having it on record—'twould be pleasant To have it in the papers of the week. Mephistopheles. “At the mouth of two witnesses the matter “Shall be established.”—By good luck, at present There's one in town, who to the fact can speak; A man of character and high condition: He'll make the necessary deposition— I'll bring him in the evening. Martha. Don't be later. Mephistopheles. And this young woman—shall we find her here? She will so please him—nay, I do not flatter;— A fine young man—has travelled far and near— Is so admired—and so admires the sex, And has so true a feeling of decorum. Margaret. I feel afraid—to meet him would perplex And so confuse—I'd blush to death before him. Mephistopheles. Were he a king—should it be thus? Martha. The garden, then, behind my house— We shall expect both gentlemen This evening there—farewell till then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE STREET. Faustus and Mephistopheles. Faustus. How fare you? goes it swimmingly on and swift? Mephistopheles. Hurrah! my friend—I'm glad to see your heart On fire—she shall be yours in less than no time: This evening, we all meet at Mrs. Schwerdtlein's. Of all the women that I ever saw She is the veriest gipsy—is the one To mould his Margaret to the doctor's purpose. Faustus. All promises well so far. Mephistopheles. But we are asked For something in return. Faustus. That's reasonable— As one good turn, they say, deserves another. Mephistopheles. We are only asked to make a deposition, In proper form, that her dead husband's bones Are lying decently interred in Padua, Quietly resting there in holy ground. Faustus. Mighty fine doings! what a pretty jaunt You have contrived for us! Mephistopheles. Sancta simplicitas! Why should we go? we are asked but to make oath— This may be done without the toil of travel, Or trouble of any kind. Faustus. Is this your plan? If you have nothing better to propose, The scheme is at an end. Mephistopheles. Oh, holy man! Is it there you are now? Doctor, is this your scruple? Is this the first time in your life that you Have borne false witness? have you lectured on God—and the world—and all that moves therein— On Man—and on “how thought originates,” And that enigma, man's mysterious nature, The intellectual and the moral powers— Have you not dealt in formal definitions, With forehead unabashed, and heart undaunted? Yet, if you did but own the truth, your conscience Must tell you—does it not?—you know no more Of all these matters than of Schwerdtlein's death. Faustus. Thou art, and wert, and thou wilt ever be A liar and sophist. Mephistopheles. Yes; if by appearances Only you judge: you, a philosopher, Should look a little deeper—you yourself, Ere two days pass—will you not?—all in honour, As you would call it—fool this poor child's fancy, And swear,—your casuistry will then be silent— How from your soul you love her—love her ever. Faustus. Yes, and such oath is true— Mephistopheles. —As any other;— And then of everlasting faith and love Will be the talk,—of all-absorbing passion— Of the one feeling—felt but once—for one: Will this, too, be a language that the heart Can recognise as true? Faustus. Peace, fiend! it will, If that I feel, and if for the emotion— The frenzy call it, rather—I still seek A name and can find none—if through the world My fancy ranging seeks analogies That are, and ever must remain, imperfect— If words that speak of time be insufficient Even feebly to express this burning feeling, And that, thus forced, I call it endless—deathless— Eternal—yes, eternal—say you that Language like this is a Satanic lie? Mephistopheles. Yes I am right. Faustus. Hark ye—take this with you— I'll spare my lungs, and cease to argue further— But, as I said, take this with you:—no matter What side a man adopts, or of what subject— If he has but a tongue, he'll not want reasons To prove him in the right; as now, for instance;— I'm tired of talk—you then are in the right— You must be, sure, when I acknowledge it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE GARDEN. Margaret on Faustus's arm, Martha with Mephistopheles. —Walking loiteringly up and down. Margaret. You do but play with my simplicity, And put me to the blush. A traveller Learns such good nature—is so pleased with all things And every body:—my poor talk, I know, Has no attraction, that could for a moment Engage the attention of a man, who has Seen so much of the world— Faustus. One glance—one word— One little word from thee, I value more Than all the wisdom of th' world's wisest ones. [Kisses her hand. Margaret. How could you think of it? How could you kiss it? It is so coarse—so hard—is spoiled with all work On every day—how could it but be coarse? My mother's habits are too close—my tasks Are too severe. [They pass on. Martha. And are you—are you always travelling thus? Mephistopheles. Alas! that claims of business and of duty Should force me to it. We feel pangs at parting From many a spot where yet we may not loiter. Martha. In youth's wild days, it cannot but be pleasant This idle roaming round and round the world, With wildfire spirits, and heart disengaged: But soon comes age and sorrow; and to drag, Through the last years of life, down to the grave A solitary creature—like the wretch, Who moves from prison on to execution— This must be bad for body and for soul. Mephistopheles. You make me shudder at the dreary prospect. Martha. Be wise—secure yourself in time. [They pass on. Margaret. Yes!—out of sight, soon out of mind. I feel this courtesy is kind;— That you, who must have many a friend Highly informed, should condescend To speak with one in my poor station. Of such neglected education, —In every thing so unimproved— Faustus. Believe me, dearest, best beloved, That, which the world calls information, Is often but the glitter chilling Of vanity and want of feeling. Margaret. How? Faustus. Ah! that—singleness of heart, And absence of all artifice, —Gifts, as they are, above all price, Heaven's holiest blessing—should be thus Of their own worth unconscious! That—meekness, gentleness, the treasure Which Nature, who doth still impart To all in love, and lavish measure, Gives to the child, whom she loves dearest,— Should— Margaret. Think of me when you are gone, A moment now and then—of you I shall have time enough to think. Faustus. Your time is passed, then, much alone? Margaret. Why, yes; and then our house affairs, Poor though they be, bring many cares. We have no servant maid, and I Must cook, knit, sew, must wash and dry; Run far and near—rise ere the light, And not lie down till late at night. And then my mother's temper's such, In every thing she asks so much; Of saving has so strict a sense, And is so fearful of expense; So anxious, so particular: —Not that our circumstances are So limited, as not to give The means like other folk to live. The property my father had, And died possessed of, was not bad: A house, and garden here, that yields Something worth while, and some town fields, Just at the gates. My days, somehow, Are tolerably quiet now— My brother earns a soldier's bread Abroad;—my little sister's dead. Trouble enough I had with her, Yet cheerfully would I incur Ten times the toil—so dear was she. Faustus. A very angel, if like thee! Margaret. Even from its birth, the child I nurst— And so it loved me from the first. Born to distress—its father torn Away by death, ere it was born. My mother, worn out with disease— We long had given her up for gone— Recovering faintly by degrees, Came slowly, very slowly on. She had no strength—she could not think Of nursing it—and so, poor thing, I reared it; for its natural drink, With bread and water tried to bring The creature on—and thus my own It seemed to be, and mine alone— Lay on my arm, and on my breast Would play and nestle, and was blest. Faustus. This must have been the purest joy. Margaret. Yet were there hours of great annoy— Its cradle was by my bedside: It kept me half the night awake, To make it quiet when I tried.— At times must I get up, to take The little urchin into bed; This would not do—then must I rise, Walk up and down with measured tread, And seek with songs to hush its cries. Then daylight brought its tasks to me: Ere dawn must I at washing be— Go to the market—light the fire; And if I felt the trouble tire On one day, 'twas the same the next. I felt dispirited, and vext At times; but I was wrong in this; For, after all, his labour is What gives a poor man's food its zest, And makes his bed a bed of rest. [They pass on. Martha. We women are the sufferers: who can make Any thing of a dissolute old rake? Mephistopheles. Yet have I perfect faith in woman's skill; You may, for instance, make me what you will. Martha. But tell me plainly, have you never met One whom you loved?—thought you of marriage yet? Mephistopheles. A blessed state—in Proverbs we are told, A good wife better is than pearls or gold. Martha. But is there none with preference you would name? Mephistopheles. All are polite and every where the same. Martha. Have you no one in seriousness addressed? Mephistopheles. With ladies can you think that I would jest? Martha. You still mistake me. Mephistopheles. I regret to find How slow I am; but one thing to my mind Is clear, that you are very, very kind. [They pass on. Faustus. And so thou didst, my angel—didst thou not?— The moment that I came into the garden, Remember me again, upon the spot? Margaret. Did you not see it?—I held down my eyes. Faustus. And thou dost,—dost thou not?—the freedom pardon Which, as you passed from the Cathedral home, I rashly took? Margaret. I felt so much surprise, And was, I scarce can tell you, so confused, And trembled like a guilty thing accused. “Into his head could such a thought have come?— What must he think of thee?—there must have been Something improper in thy walk or mien; Something that gave this gentleman to see, Here is a girl with whom you may make free.” Yet must I own I did not then detect How my heart pleaded for thee, nor suspect I with myself was angry, that, with thee, As angry, as I ought, I could not be. Faustus. Sweet love! Margaret. One moment wait. [She plucks a star-flower, and picks off the leaves one after another. Faustus. Why pluck the star-flower? —Do you wish a bunch of flowers? Margaret. No, I just fancied Trying a little game of chance. Faustus. What mean you? Margaret. You will laugh at me. [She plucks off the leaves, and murmurs to herself. Faustus. What are you murmuring? Margaret (half aloud). He loves me—loves me not. Faustus. Angelic creature! Margaret. [As she plucks off the last leaf with eager delight. He loves me! Faustus. Yes, my child, deem this language of the flower The answer of an oracle—“He loves thee!” Dost thou know all the meaning of “He loves thee?” [Holds both her hands. Margaret. I am all over trembling. Faustus. Tremble not! Oh, let this look, this pressure of the hands, Say, to thee, what no words can say: henceforth Be our whole being lost in one another In overflowing joy—that lives and lives For ever and for ever! could it end, It were—but no, it cannot, cannot end! [Margaret presses his hands; disengages herself from him, and runs away. He stands for a moment, thoughtful, and follows her. Martha. The night is coming on. Mephistopheles. We should be going. Martha. I would invite you to stay longer, but We live in a censorious neighbourhood. They seem to have nothing to think of or to do But watch the doors, and who go in and out: Do what you will, your doings will be misconstrued: But our young couple—saw you them? Mephistopheles. They've flown Up yonder walk—gay butterflies— Martha. He seems Caught. Mephistopheles. And she too. 'Tis the way of the world</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A SUMMER HOUSE. Margaret runs in; fixes herself behind the door; holds the tip of her finger to her lips, and peeps through the crevice. Margaret. He comes. Faustus. Ah, rogue! and do you thus provoke me? I've caught you at last. [Kisses her. [Mephistopheles knocks. Faustus (stamping). Who's there? Mephistopheles. A friend. Faustus. A brute. Mephistopheles. Full time to go. Martha (comes up.) 'Tis late, my lord.— Faustus. May I not see you home? Margaret. My mother would—farewell. Faustus. Must I then go?— Farewell. Martha. Adieu! Margaret. To meet again, and soon. [Exeunt Faustus and Mephistopheles. Margaret. How many things a man like this Must know;—and I had but a “Yes,” For every thing he said;—confused By every word; yet he excused Each fault of mine. What can it be, That thus attaches him to me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOREST AND CAVERN. Faustus (alone). Yes! lofty Spirit, thou hast given me all, All that I asked of thee; and not in vain, In unconsuming fire revealed, hast thou Been with me, manifesting gloriously Thy presence—thou hast looked on me with love, —Hast given me empire o'er majestic Nature; Power to enjoy and feel! 'Twas not alone The stranger's short permitted privilege Of momentary wonder that thou gavest; No, thou hast given me into her deep breast As into a friend's secret heart to look; Hast brought to me the tribes of living things: Thus teaching me to recognise and love My brothers in still grove, or air, or stream. And when in the wide wood the tempest raves, And shrieks, and rends the giant pines, uproots, Disbranches, and, with maddening grasp uplifting, Flings them to earth, and from the hollow hill Dull moaning thunders echo their descent; Then dost thou lead me to the safe retreat Of some low cavern, there exhibiting To my awed soul its own mysterious nature! Of my own heart the depths miraculous, Its secret inward being all exposed! And when before my eye the pure moon walks High over-head, diffusing a soft light, Then from the rocks, and over the damp wood, The pale bright shadows of the ancient times Before me seem to move, and mitigate The too severe delight of earnest thought!— Alas! even now I feel MAN's joys must be Imperfect ever. The ecstatic bliss, Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods; This is thy gift; but with it thou hast given, Inseparably linked, this vile associate, Whom I abominate, but cannot part:— Cold, insolent, malicious, he contrives To make me to myself contemptible; And with a breath will scatter into nothing All these high gifts; with what officious zeal He fans my breast into a raging flame Of passion, to possess that perfect form Of loveliness! Thus, from desire I pass On to enjoyment, and, uneasy still, Even in enjoyment languish for desire! [Mephistopheles enters. Mephistopheles. Have you not had enough of this before? A pretty kind of life to live for ever! Well enough for a trial. Come, come, let us Seek something new. Faustus. I wish you had something else To do than thus torment me when I'm quiet. Mephistopheles. Well! well! and if you wish I'll leave you here To your delights—never say it again. Great loss to me, indeed, 'twould be to lose A petulant, unsocial, crazy creature Of a companion—kept the whole day long Busy, and never can make any guess From my lord's countenance, whether your worship Is pleased or is displeased by what I do. Faustus. Ay, there's the tone—that is so very like him: Tires me to death—expects me then to thank him! Mephistopheles. Poor child of earth! and couldst thou, then, have borne Thy life till now without my aid? 'Twas I That saved thee from imaginations idle! I guarded thee with long and anxious care; And, but for me, even now thou wouldst have been Idling in other worlds! Why sittest thou there, Lingering in hollow cave, or rifted rock, Dull as the moping owl? Why, like the toad, Dost thou support a useless life, deriving Subsistence from damp moss and dripping stone? Sweet pastime this! most charming occupation! I fear you've not forgotten your old trade. Faustus. Couldst thou conceive what added life is given In hours like this, passed in the wilderness, And couldst thou feel it—still thou wouldst remain The devil thou art—still hate and poison it! Wouldst grudge the short delight— Mephistopheles. Delight indeed! Yes, transcendental rapture!—mighty fine!— In night and dew lying among the hills, In ecstasy embracing earth and heaven— To swell up till you are a kind of god— To pierce into the marrow of the earth In a fool's fancies—all the six-days' task Of the creation in thy breast to feel— And in the pride of conscious power enjoy I know not what of bliss,—to cherish love That has no limits, but must overflow Till it loves every thing that is—till earth And man's poor nature, in the trance forgotten, Has passed away—and then the glorious hour Of intuition ending—how it ends I must not say— Faustus. Fie, fie upon thee. Mephistopheles. Yes! “Fie, fie!”—it does not suit your taste, forsooth— Fie, fie! this mannerly word sounds very well In your mouth now. The modest ears are closed, And will not hear of what the modest heart Yet cannot go without. Good, good!—a word, However, upon what you said—I grudge not To you or any man such pleasure, as He now and then may feel, in playing tricks Of self-deception; pity 'twill not last. You are already blown out of your course— Are almost what you were when first we met; And, if you don't take care, will fret yourself Soon into actual madness—frenzy-fever, Or melancholy horror. For your own sake Have done with this: your love, poor creature! sits Within there,—you should soothe her! All with her Is sad and gloomy—out of her poor mind You never are: she loves devotedly, Poor thing!—on thee she thinks—thinks evermore. First came the flood of thy o'erflowing passion, As swells, when the snows melt, a mountain brook Above its banks—and thou into her heart Hast poured the sudden gush; and now the brook Is dry with thee again: methinks 'twere well, Instead of reigning here among the woods On an imaginary throne, that you Would comfort the young monkey, and requite The poor thing for her love,—to her the time Seems miserably long—she lingers at The window, gazes on the clouds that pass Slow o'er the old town-walls. “Oh that I were A little bird!” she cries. This is her song All the day long, and half the heavy night! One moment is she mirthful—mostly is Sad,—then she weeps till she can weep no more; Then, as 'twould seem, she is at rest again. But mirth or grief, whatever the mood be, This all is love—deep, tender, passionate love. Faustus. Serpent—vile serpent! Mephistopheles (aside). Ay, and one that stings. Faustus. Infamous wretch, begone! name not her name— Pollute it not—stir not into desire My half-distracted senses. Mephistopheles. What is this?— She deems herself abandoned—and is right. Faustus. Off, viper! Mephistopheles. You are raving—I am laughing: What a hard task it is, forsooth—just think, And let it cure your spirits,—you are going Not—as to look at you one might believe— Not to the gibbet—but to a fond mistress! Faustus. What were the joys of Heaven, if with them blest In her embrace?—could my disquiet be Stilled on her bosom? could it hush to rest This drear presentiment of her undoing? And am I not the outcast—the accurst— The homeless one, whose wanderings never cease— The monster of his kind? No rest for me— No aim—no object; like the stream, that, nurst With swelling rains, foaming from rock to rock, Along its course of ruin, On to the inevitable precipice— Plunges impatient down the blind abyss, And violently seeks the desperate shock. And—by the side of such mad stream—was she, —A child with a child's feelings;—her low cot In the green field upon the mountain-slope, And all that she could wish, or love, or hope, Her little world, all—all in that poor spot;— And I—the heaven-detested!—was it not Enough, that the mad torrent grasped and tore The rocks, and shivered them to dust, and bore All, that opposed me, in my downward course On with me?—Her, too, her—her peace—her joy— These must I undermine?—these too destroy? Hell! Hell!—this victim also!—Thy support, Devil! and the dreadful interval make short! What must be, be it soon! Let the crush fall Down on me of her ruin—perish all— She—I—and these wild thoughts together! Mephistopheles. What! in the fever fit again? How seethes and burns the muddy brain! —Idiot, go in, and comfort her. Thus is it ever with the crazy pate, When difficulties thwart, Or unforeseen calamities occur: Fools, when they cannot see their way, At once grow desperate, Have no resource—have nothing to propose— But fix a dull eye of dismay Upon the final close. Success to the stout heart, say I, That sees its fate, and can defy! —Yet art thou, though of such soft stuff, In most things pretty devil enough;— Of all insipid things, I least can bear That sickening dose—a devil in despair!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARGARET'S OWN ROOM. Margaret (alone at the spinning-wheel). (Sings.) My peace is gone, And my heart is sore: I have lost him, and lost him, For evermore! The place, where he is not, To me is the tomb, The world is sadness, And sorrow and gloom! My poor sick brain Is crazed with pain, And my poor sick heart Is torn in twain! My peace is gone, And my heart is sore, For lost is my love For evermore! From the window for him My heavy eyes roam; To seek him, all lonely I wander from home. His noble form, His bearing high, The smiles of his lip, And the power of his eye; And the magic tone Of that voice of his, His hands' soft pressure, And oh! his kiss! My peace is gone, And my heart is sore; I have lost him, and lost him, For evermore! Far wanders my heart To feel him near, Oh! could I clasp him, And hold him here! Hold him and kiss him, Oh! I could die! To feed on his kisses, How willingly!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARTHA'S GARDEN. MARGARET—FAUSTUS. Margaret. Promise me, Henry. Faustus. Be assured, my love. Margaret. Tell me but this:—what think you of religion? You are a good and honest-minded man; But, I believe, and fear, think little of it. Faustus. Forbear, my child—thou feelest that I love thee; For them I love would give my life away— I would not rob another of his hopes In Heaven, or of his faith in creeds and churches. Margaret. 'Tis well—but more than this—you must believe. Faustus. Must I? Margaret. Oh, had I any influence! —Thou honourest not the holy sacraments? Faustus. I honour them. Margaret. But thou dost not receive.— At mass or shrift 'tis long since thou hast been. —Dost thou believe in God? Faustus. Forbear, my love; Who can say truly, “I believe in God?” —Ask it of priest or of philosopher, And the reply seems but a mockery Of him who asks. Margaret. Then thou dost not believe! Faustus. Misunderstand me not, thou best-beloved: Who can name Him, and, knowing what he says, Say, “I believe in Him?” And who can feel, And, with self-violence, to conscious wrong Hardening his heart, say, “I believe him not!” The All-embracing, All-sustaining One, Say, doth he not embrace, sustain, include Thee?—Me?—Himself?—Bends not the sky above? And earth, on which we are, is it not firm? And over us with constant kindly smile, The sleepless stars keep everlasting watch! Am I not here gazing into thine eyes? And does not All, that is, —Seen and unseen, mysterious all— Around thee, and within, Untiring agency, Press on thy heart and mind? —Fill thy whole heart with it—and when thou art Lost in the consciousness of happiness— Then call it what thou wilt, Happiness!—heart!—love!—God! I have no name for it—Feeling is all. Nature is but an echo of the voice That rings through all—a vapour hiding Heaven! Margaret. This is all good and right; The priest says pretty much the same, But in words somewhat different. Faustus. Every where, All hearts beneath the universal Heaven, In its own language each doth utter it— Then why not I in mine? Margaret. Made easy thus 'Tis plausible—yet must it be unsafe: Thou art no Christian. Faustus. Hush, my child. Margaret. I grieve to see the company thou keepest. Faustus. What do you mean? Margaret. The man whom thou hast ever at thy side, I hate him from the bottom of my soul. In my whole life, has nothing given my heart So deep a wound, as that man's alien visage. Faustus. Beloved, fear him not. Margaret. The very sight of him makes my blood thrill! To most men I feel kindliness—but him Do I detest; and with a feeling strong, Strong as my love for you—strong as my wishes To have you with me—does a secret shudder Creep over me when I behold this man. He is—I cannot be deceived—he is A villain;—God forgive me, if I wrong him! Faustus. He's a queer fellow—do not mind his oddities. Margaret. I would not—could not, live together with him. If for a moment he comes to the door, He will look in with such an air of mockery, And a half scowl, and a face dark with anger Kept down—you see he has no interest In any thing—'tis written on his brow He feels no love for any living soul— And when I am so happy in thy arms, In the sweet confidence of love forgetting— Forgetting every thing but thee, then—then He's sure to come, and my heart shrinks and withers! Faustus. Foreboding angel, these are weak misgivings! Margaret. The feeling overmasters me so wholly, That if he does but join us, straightway seems it As if I ceased to love thee—where he is I could not pray. This eats into my heart. Henry, it cannot be but that you feel In this as I do. Faustus. This is antipathy. Margaret. I must away. Faustus. Alas! and may I never Meet thee, where none can come to trouble us? One little hour—and must it never be?— Heart prest to happy heart, and soul to soul! Margaret. Ah, that I slept alone! This very night How gladly would I leave the door unbolted! But then my mother's sleep is far from sound; Did she awake and find you there, I should, Methinks, drop dead upon the spot. Faustus. Dear angel, throw aside such fears; this phial Take with you. Three drops of it only, poured Into her drink, wrap nature up in sleep, Deep tranquil sleep. Margaret. I must do as you bid. Could I refuse you?—'Twill not injure her? Faustus. It will not: otherwise would I advise it? Margaret. Dearly beloved, if I but look on you I must obey—I cannot hesitate: There is a something not to be resisted, Which overpowers me—makes your will my guide In every thing; and having gone so far Already, is choice left me? Having given So much, what is there for me to refuse? Mephistopheles (enters). The monkey! is it gone? Faustus. Again— Spying?— Mephistopheles. Yes, and I heard quite plain The doctor schooled,—the catechumen Getting a lesson in his creed, And catechism, from a young woman, Just now;—I hope that it agreed With you! The girls' anxiety For sentimental piety Is soon explained. The man, think they, Who worships in the good old way, When his priest bids him kneels and bows, Is likely to obey his spouse: This of itself ensures his wife A quiet, fair and easy life. The women fancy, and the fact is Confirmed, or often so, in practice, That their admirers are most found Where your religious men abound— Love is almost the same emotion: The devotee—such is their notion— Thus for the sex feels true devotion, Courts amorous thoughts and mystic dreaming, Is led by priests, and follows women. Faustus. Oh! what a monster must thou be. To see not, or with scoffing see, How this poor girl's affections lead The pious creature thus to plead; The faith, in which she moves and lives— That which alone salvation gives— So she believes—may make her fear Danger to one whom she holds dear; Fear for the issue of a strife Where more, she feels, is risked than life! Mephistopheles. Most sentimental sensualist, —Philosopher at once and beast,— Led by the nose by a young flirt! Faustus. Abortion—spawn of fire and dirt! Mephistopheles (scornfully). —On Physiognomy she also lectures Profoundly—feels, when I am present, Sensations strange and most unpleasant: —Suppressed malignity my smile betrays; I wear a mask, forsooth, I will not raise, And what it hides she sapiently conjectures, Something mysteriously allied to evil, A genius—or, perhaps, the very devil. To-night then. Faustus. What 's to-night to thee? Mephistopheles. I've my amusements too—we'll see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT THE WELL. Margaret and Lizzy (with pitchers). Lizzy. Have you not heard of Hannah's pretty doing? Margaret. No, not a word—I've been but little out. Lizzy. Kate told it me to-day—there's not a doubt Of its truth. This comes of airs and impudence: I always said her pride would be her ruin. Margaret. What mean you? Lizzy. What I mean all know but you— Why, when she eats and drinks she's feeding two. Margaret. Poor thing! Lizzy. Poor thing, indeed! great pity for her; Why, she was always finding some pretence To be in company with this adorer Of hers;—at every party—every walk— How she made out a time for private talk! Would hang upon his arm, and still be seen For evermore with him, at booth or green. She thought herself so fine, none could come near her; And then their feastings—cakes and wine must cheer her After their rambles: then her vanity About her beauty almost like insanity— And then her meanness—think of her insisting Upon his making handsome presents to her— Then came soft words, when there were none to listen, Then all a girl can give she gave her wooer! Margaret. The poor, poor thing! Lizzy. And do you pity her? When we were kept close to our wheels, and when Our mothers would not suffer us to stir Abroad at night, or loiter with the men, Then were they on the seat before the door, Or in the dark walk lingering evermore; Now for the stool and white sheet of repentance; For one, I feel no sorrow at her sentence. Margaret. Poor creature! but, no doubt, he'll marry her. Lizzy. He!—he'll be no such fool—the de'il may carry her, For what he cares—they say that he is off; He'll find another market soon enough. Margaret. That is not fair. Lizzy. 'Twill be almost as bad, We will so plague her—if she get the lad;— The wedding garland, should she think to wear it, From the mock virgin shall the children tear it; And, at her door, what fun we shall have, spreading Chopped straw, to greet the promise of their wedding. [Exit. Margaret (returning home). How I would rail when some poor girl went wrong! How, when it was another's sin and shame, Words of reproach would rise up to my tongue! Oh, this was then a black offence, and I Made it in thought more black; no words of blame This virtuous scorn of mine could satisfy— Others might fall, but I more proud became, And I—who thus could feel—am I the same? But could I—who could—have resisted here? All was so good!—all was so very dear!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ZWINGER.—A LITTLE SHRINE. In a niche of the wall an image of the Mater Dolorosa, with flowers before it.—Margaret places fresh flowers in the bowls. Margaret. Mother benign, Look down on me! No grief like thine; Thou who dost see In his death-agony Thy Son divine. In faith unto the Father Dost thou lift up thine eyes; In faith unto the Father Dost pray with many sighs. The sword is piercing thine own soul, and thou in pain dost pray, That the pangs which torture him, and are thy pangs, may pass away. And who my wound can heal, And who the pain can feel, That rends asunder brain and bone? How my poor heart, within me aching, Trembles and yearns, and is forsaken— Thou knowest it—thou alone! Where can I go? Where can I go? Every where woe! woe! woe! Nothing that does not my own grief betoken; And when I am alone, I moan, and moan, and moan, And am heart-broken. The flowers upon my window sill, Wet with my tears since dawn they be; All else were sleeping, while I was weeping, Praying and choosing flowers for thee. Into my chamber brightly Came the early sun's good morrow; On my restless bed, unsightly, I sate up in my sorrow. Oh, in this hour of death, and the near grave, Succour me, thou, and save! Look on me with that countenance benign. Never was grief like thine,— Look down, look down on mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NIGHT. STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR. Valentine (a soldier—Madge's brother). Till now, as round the canteen hearth, My comrades, in their drunken mirth, Would of their favourites gaily boast, And pledge with soldier's glee the toast; How on my elbow I would rest, Smile as each swore his own the best, And stroke my beard, and raise my glass, And when my turn to name the lass Came round, would say, “Each to his taste; In my own home my heart is placed. Where is the maiden, any where, That with my Margaret can compare? Is there than Madge's in the land A truer heart or fairer hand?” Oh, then, how cups and goblets rang, While voices rose with joyous clang: “Right, right,” in chorus, hundreds cried, “First of them all—the country's pride— His sister is”—and dumb and tame The boasters suddenly became. And now—oh, I could rend my hair, Could dash my brains out in despair;— Now must I feel my bosom gored By daggers in each casual word, And every ruffian's sneering eye And scornful taunt my patience try; Gnawing my wrath must I remain, And suffer and suppress my pain, Nor dare say any word again; As hears the debtor gibe and curse, Who meets a claim with empty purse. Avenge it—what can vengeance do? Must I not feel the taunt is true? See yonder! sneaking out of sight, Two skulking scoundrels.—Am I right? —'Tis he—would Heaven that it were he— He scarce shall 'scape me if it be. Faustus—Mephistopheles. Faustus. See, in the window of yon sacristy, How from its little lamp the constant light Streams up—while, at the sides, less and less bright, 'Tis fading—till it dies in the thick night That deepens round—and thus is it with me— Darkness on every side around me spreads. Mephistopheles. And I—I am the thievish cat, that treads, With stealthy and suspicious pace, Up ladders and down leads, Culprit-like creeping to the guilty place. Already do I feel the power, The fun and frolic of the hour; The advent of Walpurgis night Bids every limb thrill with delight: Another night—another day, And then the glorious first of May; Then to the Brocken fare we forth, Then learn that life is something worth. Faustus. Behold yon blue light glimmering! Is that the treasure? Lurks it there? And will it from the dark earth spring? Mephistopheles. Be patient—you shall shortly bring The casket into open air: I peeped into the secret hoard, And saw the lion-dollars stored. Faustus. What! merely money? who would think it? What good is this? no ring—no trinket? No ornament for the dear girl? Mephistopheles. Oh yes; there are some beads of pearl. Faustus. I am glad of it,—it is not pleasant To go to her without some present. Mephistopheles. Is there then no such thing as pleasure, But what you may by payment measure? I differ there with you—but see, The heaven is hushed, and full of stars: Now for a moment favour me With silence—while I sing some bars Of an old song—a sweet old air, Touched with true skill—a moral song That lures the heart and will along. (Sings to the guitar.) Why, Catherine, stay At dawn of day, At dawning gray, Before the younker's door? The merry blade Lets in the maid, That out a maid Never departeth more! Beware—beware, And guard, ye fair, Your hearts with care. Poor things, beware of men— Oh, listen not to any thing They may say, or swear, or sing, Till in the finger is the ring— Beware, say I again. Valentine (comes forward). What brings ye here? whom come ye to destroy, Cursed rat-catchers?—to the devil with the lure— To the devil with the scoundrels. Mephistopheles. Well done, boy, The poor guitar is cracked beyond all cure. Valentine. Now for his skull. Mephistopheles. Now, Doctor, now's your time. Courage—stick close—that's a brave fellow: Have at him—just do as I tell you— Out with your duster—thrust away— I'll parry. Valentine. Parry that. Mephistopheles. Child's play! Easily done. Valentine. And that. Mephistopheles. As easy quite. Valentine. The devil assists him in the fight— My hand is wounded. Mephistopheles. Now thrust home. Valentine. Oh, torture! Mephistopheles. The clown's done for—come, We'd best be off—have not a minute To lose—already is the cry Of murder raised—and although I Know the police, and have friends in it, This is a very ugly scrape. To manage it in any shape Perplexes me. Martha (at the window). Up!—up!— Margaret (at her window). A light! Martha. Railing and scuffling—how they fight! People (in the street). One of them is already dead. Martha. Seize on the murderers—are they fled? Margaret (coming out). Who is it—who? People. Thy mother's son. Margaret. Oh God! Valentine. I die—said soon—soon done! Women, why stand you wailing, crying? Will you not listen? I am dying. Margaret, take counsel, you are still Young, and conduct your business ill; I speak in confidence—you are A strumpet—throw away pretence— Be one in earnest—there were sense In this—be one thing or the other. Margaret. My God! what can you mean, my brother? Valentine. Best let the name of God alone! That which is done, alas! is done. The past is past—the wretched game You play is every where the same, Begins in folly—ends in shame. First one man visits—then, less private, Another; soon the coy beginner Will welcome all, till she arrive at The streets, and is a common sinner. When Shame is born, she shrinks from sight, Draws over her the veil of night, Trembles at every stir, and tries Of hood and cloak the mean disguise, Yea—unfamiliar yet with sin— Would hush the warning voice within. On moves she unobserved, unknown; But bigger soon, and bolder grown, Walks, hand in hand, the broad highway, With Slander, in the eye of day, And as her features, marred and coarse, From hour to hour look worse and worse, While men behold her with affright, She stalks affronting the daylight. Already do I see the day, When all, with loathing, turn away From thee, as from a plague-struck corse, I see the gnawings of remorse: —Abandoned outcast of the street, How wilt thou bear their eyes to meet? Never, as once, the golden chain To wear in pride—never again! Never again, that fairest face, To shine at church, in the high place, And never more the dance to grace;— No more in modest pride to deck With frills of snowy lace thy neck; But in some filthy nook to lie, 'Mong strumpets live—'mong beggars die; And find, for thee, heart-broken one, Though God has mercy, Man has none. Martha. Pray, dying man, for mercy; dread To heap God's curses on thy head! Valentine. Fiend, could I tear thy leprous skin! Procuress! sordid slave of sin! Then might I rest, my conscience freed From every weight by that one deed. Margaret. My—brother—oh, what agony— Brother, forgive—I grieve for thee. Valentine. Cease weeping thus for me: thy fall— That was the sharpest wound of all. Fearless I go—as fits the brave— To God and to a soldier's grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CATHEDRAL. SERVICE.—ORGAN AND ANTHEM. Margaret among a number of people.—Evil Spirit behind Margaret. Evil Spirit. How changed is every thing With thee, poor Margaret, Since when, still full of innocence, Thou to this very altar Didst come, and from the little old thumbed prayer-book Didst lisp the murmured prayers; Half with the children out at play, In a child's happy fancies, thy young heart, And half with God in heaven. And dost thou, canst thou think? .. Thy vrain, where wanders it? .. In thy heart oh what a weight Of guilt! of evil done! Prayest thou for thy mother's soul— She who through thee did sleep and sleep away Into undying agonies? And on thy door-stead whose the blood? And in thy bosom is there not A stirring, that is torture, And with foreboding fears Makes felt the present woe? Margaret. Woe, woe! Oh that I could escape These dark thoughts flitting over and athwart me, And all accusing me! Choir. Dies Iræ, Dies illa Solvet sæclum in favilla. Evil Spirit. The judgment arrests thee— The trumpet is sounding— The graves are a-stir— And thy heart, From the sleep of its ashes, For fiery torture Created again, Awakes up and trembles. Margaret. That I were out of this— I feel as if the organ Stifled my breathing, And that the anthem was Breaking my heart. Choir. Judex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit, Nil inultum remanebit. Margaret. I feel so tightened here, The pillars of the wall Are grasping me; The arch above Weighs on me.—Air! Evil Spirit. Hide thyself—sin and shame Will find thee out— Oh, never were they hidden— Air—light—exposure— Woe's thee! Choir. Quid sum miser tunc dicturus, Quem patronum rogaturus, Cum vix justus sit securus.

      <field name="fulltext">WALPURGIS NIGHT. HARTZ MOUNTAINS. Shirke and Elend. Faustus—Mephistopheles. Mephistopheles. Would not a broomstick be a good thing here For a tired man to ride? I wish I had got A buck-goat, rough and tough—neck thick, trot quick: The road is long, and we are loitering, The time just come—the place still far away. Faustus. While I feel firm upon my limbs, the road Thus wild and intricate but pleases me; And this knobbed staff affords support enough. Why should we wish the way more short? To steal Silently through the deep vale's labyrinth, And issuing thence to climb these rocks, from which The bubbling water gushes up for ever, And streams a white precipitous cataract— 'Tis this—'tis this that makes such paths delightful. The stirring breath of spring hath waked the birch, And the slow pine already feels her power— Shall we alone of all that live and breathe Remain uninfluenced by her cheering spirit? Mephistopheles. I can feel nothing of it—all within With me is winter—give me the bleak snow, And the cold ice upon my desolate path. With what a red and melancholy light The waning moon's imperfect orb is moving, Casting faint, cold, unserviceable beams, And making each step dangerous—lest the foot Dash 'gainst some straggling tree or jutting rock; I'll call a wildfire Will-o'-the-Wisp to light us. See, there is one burns bright and merrily. The freakish spark, look, how he flings away On the regardless night his spendthrift splendour. Holla! my friend, come join our company; Come, come, instead of wasting idly there, Come be the pilot of our perilous way, Move on, and light us through the desert moors. Will-o'-the-Wisp. Yours most respectfully—I'll strive to serve you; But it is struggling against nature—devious And zig-zag is our customary course. Mephistopheles. Ha, ha!—ha, ha! he thinks to mimic man; Go straight—for once—in the devil's name, go straight— On, saucy spark, on—or I'll blow thee out, Poor gleam of marsh-light life. Will-o'-the-Wisp. 'Tis plain to see That the master of the house is here—my lord, I will be all I can be, to oblige you,— But, think, the hill to-day is mad with magic; And, if we should not go the straightest road, Remember that your guide is but a meteor. Faustus, Mephistopheles, Meteor (alternately). Song. Into the magic world, the centre Of fancies strange and dreamy science, By a meteor led, we enter, His wild light our best reliance. Then, Meteor, guide us on in haste, Through regions lonely, wide, and waste. Woods—how swift they vanish by us! Trees on trees—how fast they fly us! And the cliffs, with antic greeting, Bending forward and retreating, How they mock the midnight meeting; Ghastly rocks grin glaring on us, Panting, blowing, as they shun us! Trickling on, through sward and stone, Rill and rivulet run down— Murmuring and rustling near, Voices meet and mock the ear; Sweet sounds greet us from above: Are they—are they words of love? Tender tones, that from the wild wood Whisper back the days of childhood? All that was, when we were young, Eden to the heart, now meets it; And the rock, with airy tongue, Recalls, restores, the enchanted song, And lingering in love repeats it. How the song of echo chimes Like the voice of other times! Tu-whoo!—Tu-whoo!—the owl's in view— Nearer, clearer, comes his hooting— Through the dusk air see him shooting— The long-horned owl, with pinions gray, The blind bat borne in circles dizzy, The crow—the lapwing—and the jay, Are wakefull all—all out and busy— See lizards in the green twigs tender, With heavy paunch and long legs slender— Every where strange sights we see— Are they what they seem to be?— Here's many a twining plant that flings Round rock and root its serpent strings, And seeks to dart, in eager watch The heedless journeyer's foot to catch, From close-compacted living masses Its angry fangs on each who passes; Every where around us playing, Many-coloured mice are straying, Numberless, 'mong moss and heather; And the fire-flies crowd together, With buzzing motion, swarming, crushing, Round our meteor leader rushing! We be strangers here who stray, Natives of the hills are they, Gleesome creatures bright and gay, Merry guides! hurrah! hurrah!— Wild the escort—wild the way! Tell me, tell me, where we are— We have wandered fast and far— Is our wizard journey ended? Is the Brocken yet ascended? Round us every thing seems wheeling, Trees are whirling, rocks are reeling— All in rapid circles spinning, With motion dizzying and dinning, Every thing that round us races Makes grotesque and fiendish faces; Swelling, puffing, multiplying, On all sides wild-fire lights are flying. Mephistopheles. Come, be alive—so far, so well; We're at the half-way pinnacle.— The worst is over now—catch fast My mantle, while we turn and cast A glance beneath us on the mines Where Mammon in the mountains shines! Faustus. What a strange glimmer stains the ground, Like the dull heavy clouds around The east, ere yet the sun ascends: Far down the dusky hue extends, For leagues below earth's surface spread, A gloomy—thick—discoloured red, Tinging the dreary sides of this Desperate, hope-deadening precipice— Here rises smoke, there vaporous whiteness, But yonder what a blaze of brightness On every object round is gleaming!— Now in a narrow thread 'tis streaming, And now the illuminating current Bursts sparkling like a winter torrent, Here, round the vale, you see it wind, In long veins delicate and slender, And there in bondage strict confined, It brightens into burning splendour! A thousand sparks, like gold-dust, sprinkling The waste air, are before us twinkling, And see the tall rock kindling, brightening, Glows with intensity of lightning— Turret,—'twould seem—and fence and spire Lit up at once with festal fire. Mephistopheles. Well, is not Mammon's princely hall Lit gaily for our festival! I'm glad you've seen it—the wild night Bodes storm, that soon will hide it quite— Already is it swept from sight— Wild work is on the winds—I see already Omens that say the boisterous guests are coming. Faustus. The angry gale blows insolently upon us! How keen and cold upon my neck it falls, Like strokes of some sharp weapon. Mephistopheles. Firmly seize The old projections of the ribbed rock— Else it will blow you down into the chasm Yawning below us like a sepulchre. Clouds frown heavily, and hearken How the wood groans as they darken, And the owls, in fear and fright At the stormy face of night, Beat the air in homeward flight; The halls of evergreen are shaking, And their thousand pillars breaking, Hearken how the tempest wrenches Groaning trunks and crashing branches, And the earth beneath is rifted, And the shrieking trees uplifted— Bole, and bough, and blossom cheerful, Fair trees fall in ruin fearful; —How the haughty forest brothers Bend and tremble!—how they fall! How they cling on one another's Arms!—each crushes each and smothers, Till, tangled, strangled, down come all; And the wild Winds through the ruin Are howling, hissing, and hallooing! Down the valleys how they sweep, Round and round, above and under, Rend the giant cliffs asunder, And, with shout and scream appalling, Catch the mighty fragments falling! How they laugh, and how they leap, As they hurry off their plunder! Headlong steep, and gorges deep, Gulf, and glen, and rock, in wonder, Echo back the stormy thunder! —List!—I thought I heard a ringing In my ear of voices singing— Above—around us—faint, now clearer, Distant now—now warbling nearer— Now all the haunted hill along Streams the maddening magic song! Witches in Chorus. On to the Brocken the witches are flocking— Merry meet—merry part—how they gallop and drive, Yellow stubble and stalk are rocking, And young green corn is merry alive, With the shapes and shadows swimming by, To the highest heights they fly, Where Sir Urian sits on high— Throughout and about, With clamour and shout, Drives the maddening rout, Over stock, over stone; Shriek, laughter, and moan, Before them are blown. A Voice. Before the rest—beyond the best— Who to lead the group is fitter? In savage pride see Baubo ride On her sow about to litter. Chorus. Baubo—honour to whom honour— Benediction be upon her— Forward, mother!—as we speed us, Who so fit as thou to lead us! Forward—clear the way before us! Then follow we in screaming chorus! A Voice. Whence came you? A Voice. Over Ilsenstein— As I past I peeped into a nest, And the night-owl, scared from her stupid rest, Fixed her frightened eyes on mine! A Voice. O go to the devil—why drive you so fast? A Voice. She grazed my side as she hurried past, And the skin is sore and the blast is chill: Look there—see where—'tis bleeding still. Chorus of Witches. The way is long, and weary, and wide— And the madman throng crowds on every side— The pitchforks scratch, and the broomsticks scrape, Will the child within escape, When the mother, crushed to death, Suffocating pants for breath? Wizards and Warlocks. Semichorus 1. Like the lazy snail, we linger and trail: Our woman-kind, as fleet as the wind, Have left us far and far behind— On a road like this men droop and drivel, While woman goes fearless and fast to the devil. Wizards and Warlocks. Semichorus 2. Swift they go, and swift they go, And gain a thousand steps or so, But slow is swift, and swift is slow. Woman will bustle, and woman will justle, But yet at the end will lose the day, For hurry and hurry as best she may, Man at one long bound clears the way. Voices from above. Come with us—come with us from Felsen-see, From the lake of rocks to the eagle height Of the hills—come with us—to-night—to-night! Voices from below. To wander above, is the thing we love. Oh for one hour of this one night! For one mad dance on the Brocken height! When shall we join in the wild delight? We have washed, and washed, and washed us quite, The breasts, that have never borne, are white, And our hearts are a-glow, our cheeks are bright— We have watched a-left—we have watched a-right, And we hear the sound of the far-off flight As they hurry away, and are swept from sight. The Two Choruses. That wind that scattered the clouds is dead, And they thicken soon o'er the wandering moon: She hides her head—and the stars are fled;— With a whispering, whistling, drizzling sound, And a fall of meteor fires around— Onward, onward, hurry, skurry, The hell-driven rout of wizards hurry. Voice from below. Stop—stop—stop. Voice from above. What voice is this Calls to us from the abyss? Seems it that the words just spoken From the crannied rock have broken? Voice from below. Stop—stop—stop—for me—for me— Guarded and bound with slant rocks round— Stop—stop—stop—and make me free— Three hundred years moiling, three hundred years toiling, Hurry work—weary work—step after step;— I grasp and I grope, and in time I have hope To climb to the top—sisters, stop—sisters, stop— I anoint every joint, and I pray my own prayer, In the May—sabbath night, to the Prince of the air.— Are you not my kindred?—and why am I hind'red From mixing among you, and meeting him there? Both Choruses. Brooms fly fast when warlocks ride 'em Rams, with those who know to guide 'em; Broken branches gallop lightly; Pitchforks, too, make coursers sprightly. A buck-goat or boar is as good as the best of them, Each man for himself, and who cares for the rest of them? Many an egg shell air-balloon, To-night will land at our saloon; He who fails in his endeavour To join us now, is gone for ever. Half-Witch from below. Far away I hear their laughter, Hopelessly I stumble after; Cannot rest at home in quiet— Here I cannot join the riot. Witches in Chorus. Strength is given us by this ointment— We will keep to-night's appointment— We can speed on sea, no matter Were the sail a cobweb tatter; And a plank as weak and thin as Snail's abandoned shell our pinnace. He who cannot fly to-night, Will never soar a wizard's flight. Both Choruses. And when we've reached the topmost bound, Like swallows skim the haunted ground; Far and wide upon the heath, Spread your circling guard beneath; Watch and ward 'gainst treachery, With all the hosts of witchery. Mephistopheles. The air is heavy and oppressive, And the whirling din excessive; Rattling with the ceaseless babble, Of the tumultuous hell-driven rabble; Sultry, vaporous, and sickening; To a denser substance thickening, Burning noisomely, and glittering With fiery sparks for ever frittering, Poisoning every thing it reaches, Atmosphere for fiends and witches. But cling more close to me, or we will lose Each other soon—where art thou? Faustus (from a great distance). Here I am! Mephistopheles. What, lost already—torn away so far— Then must I show that I am master here! Make way, good people, for my young friend yonder:— Room for young Voland—room, sweet people, room Here, Doctor, cling to me, and with one spring We'll rid ourselves of the whole set at once. They are too bad—this raving is too much Even for me.—Look yonder at the blaze Of brightness—a distinct and steady flame: How different from all the brimstone torches And wildfire lights that madden round the hill,— It tempts me to explore that distant copse— Come let us steal away from this wild crowd. Faustus. Spirit of Contradiction—well, lead on! I cannot but admire the bright idea Of wandering to the Brocken in May-night, To enjoy, forsooth, the charms of solitude. Mephistopheles. See, see the lights! how cheerily they burn! There seems to be a merry set assembled, A little party met of choice gay spirits. Faustus. Yet would I rather be above—see! see! Where through the whirls of smoke bursts the red light, And glows and triumphs—in what hurrying waves Numbers on numbers evermore increasing, The thickening throng streams onward—still—still onward— All under the resistless fascination— All to the worship of the evil One— The clue to many a puzzling mystery May be found here—to-night will be unravelled Many a strange riddle. Mephistopheles. And strange riddles, too, May be proposed to-night, and not unravelled— But leave we the great world and its distractions, While we enjoy our quiet corner here. 'Tis quite established that, in all large parties, The guests divide in small and scattered circles— See the young witches all are naked there, And all the old ones with coy bashfulness, Veiling their timid charms—come, come, look pleasant, If it were only to oblige a friend— 'Tis not much trouble, and we'll have rare sport. I hear the music—curse upon their scraping!— But 'twill sound better when we're used to it. Come, come, I must insist upon your coming— Come—I must introduce my honoured friend. Well now, what think you? Is not this a long And splendid room? You scarce can see the end! A line of fires—at least a hundred, shine Brilliantly: what a scene of gaiety Of all kinds—chatting, dancing, drinking here— Cooking, and making love—can any thing In the world be pleasanter? Faustus. In what character Are we to know you—devil, or conjuror? Mephistopheles. I travel, usually, incognito; But upon gala days the great display Their stars and orders.—I've no need to sport A garter—for the horse's foot is here In high repute.—See you that sliding snail? Eye—smell—touch—all gathered up into one? Hither she creeps—her trembling feelers out— Instinctively she knows that I am here, And touching—smelling—eyeing, on prowls she, Crowding herself together—wide awake— Out of her frozen sleep suddenly roused. Even if I wished disguise, it here would be A thing impossible—come, come with me. Forward from fire we saunter on to fire: Play you the lover where I introduce you. [As they pass on, Mephistopheles addresses a party sitting round a few dying embers. Old gentlemen, pray, how do you get on In the corner here? Why—sure you ought to be Alive, and flirting in some merry circle. See, where the gay young girls are giggling, yonder,— If you are thus dull, you might have stayed at home. General. Who may trust a people's favour, Though he fight for them for ever? To nations, as to girls ungrateful, The young are dear, the old are hateful. Ex-Minister. Little now to prize or praise; —Give me back the good old days, When kings and courts obeyed our call, And ourselves were all in all. Parvenu. I was one of Fortune's pupils, Disregarded doubts and scruples; Thus her golden gifts I found; Then, alas! the wheel turned round. Author. How public taste declines!—they never Read works that once were counted clever; —And then the critics—all invidious— Pert, prating, ignorant, fastidious! Mephistopheles (who has suddenly assumed the appearance of extreme old age). I feel the world is waning into age; All things are ripening fast for the last day. With feeble, tottering feet, for the last time, I've climbed the witches' hill—the wine of life Is low with me—and therefore 'tis that I, An old man, think the world is on the lees. Huckster-Witch. Who'll buy? who'll buy?—great bargains going! Rare things here to tempt the knowing!— Stop and see them!—my collection Well deserves minute inspection. Such variety, in vain Would you hope to meet again, Of the curious articles, Which your own old woman sells: Rare and precious! every one Hath on earth its business done. Will you have the dagger knife, That hath drained a brother's life? Or the cup that held a draft, Which was death to him that quaffed? —This was from a royal feast, And a queen had drugged the bowl: —This a chalice, and the priest —On him a confiding soul Looked for comfort—poured in it Venom of the aconite: Here are trinkets—chain and gem— Young man, you should purchase them— Pearls, with which the wealthy donor Won vain woman to dishonour. Poor things! poor things!—the best and kindest Fall soonest, for their heart is blindest, And feels, and loves, and does not reason— And they are lost—poor things! poor things! —Here are swords, the gift of kings, That have done the work of treason; Or pierced, some coward hand directing, The sleeping or the unsuspecting. Mephistopheles. Old lady, you mistake the times we live in— Every one's heart to novelty is given: Throw out your box of relics—such antiques As these no creature fancies now or seeks. The past is dead and gone—the present passion Is novelty—this trash is out of fashion. Faustus. Scarce know I who I am or where— They crowd and crush as at a fair. Mephistopheles. Forward the whirling crowd is striving, All driven along the stream and driving, All rushing on in one direction, And each enjoying the reflection That he to-night is his own sovereign, That his own thoughts his movements govern, Unconscious that the same broad river Bears down its wave each self-deceiver. Faustus. Who's that? Mephistopheles. Her features closely scan— 'Tis the first wife of the first man. Faustus. Who say you? Mephistopheles. Adam's first wife, Lilith. Beware—beware of her bright hair, And the strange dress that glitters there: Many a young man she beguileth, Smiles winningly on youthful faces, But woe to him whom she embraces! Faustus (looking at another group). The old grey witch—how she squats down—poor devil! Panting for breath—half-dead—fainting and floundering— And the young vixen with her finds the revel Rather too much for her—she, too, is foundering. Mephistopheles. Nonsense—the fun will ne'er be over. Advance, my friend, and play the lover. Look, man, the girl's well worth the winning— Come, join the dances just beginning. [Faustus and Mephistopheles take partners. Faustus (dancing with the young witch). 'Twas my fortune once to see In a dream an apple-tree; Rosy apples—one, two, three— With a glad smile tempted me; And to-night again I seem, In the trance of that sweet dream, Lovely is the tree I wis, And the apple pleasant is. His Partner. Dear little apples—ay! their price Was more than gold in paradise— And pleasant to the sight and touch I come from gardens rich in such. Mephistopheles (with the old witch). I had a troubled dream, and it Was haggard as a night-mare fit. I saw an old tree torn and split, And yet it pleased me, I admit. His Partner. With lowest courtesy I salute The gay knight of the Horse's Foot: The tree of knowledge, trunk and root, Is his—and his must be the fruit. Proctophantasmist. Cursed devils—how they murder All attempts at keeping order: All in vain it is to prove To Spirits by what laws they move:— Mocking at all regulation, Ridiculing demonstration, See them onward still advancing, Ghosts! like men and women dancing. Faustus's Partner. Who's this presumes to interfere? What means the forward fellow here? Faustus. What—he?—why he is every where— He never dances—but he guides Opinion—disapproves—decides— On carriage and the true division Of time gives laws with calm precision. While others dance he criticizes, And all is perfect that he prizes; And what he does not prate about Is but of small account, no doubt: Nay, such his wondrous powers of seeing, What he beholds not has no being; Our careless grouping must perplex him, But dancing forward's sure to vex him. The only figures he approves Are where the set in circles moves, Still turning his own humdrum round Within the same contracted bound, Holding, at times, grave consultation, Listening to him with veneration, As he with magisterial rigour Commands a change of tune and figure. Proctophantasmist. Still here! defying me! this rabble Of rude ghosts!—'tis intolerable! What! restlessly still thronging hither? Vanish from my sight—fade—wither— How can men say that spectres haunt 'em? —The mind, does it not make the phantom? Who and what are they?—mere relations That we may see or not at pleasure— And here they come and—grant me patience— Mix in the dance—converse at leisure. I thought, that, by my labours brightened, The world for this was too enlightened. These devils—they rise, and in derision Of all I say, still cross my vision. What—beings, that have no existence, To mock each law of time and distance! Why, after this, the Tegel ghost May grin again at his old post. I thought I'd swept away these fancies Of plays, and poems, and romances! Still here! with all the noise of Babel, These dreams of a forgotten fable! Faustus's Partner. Silence, silence, old intruder! Proctophantasmist. What! the ghosts are growing ruder— How they beard me, in defiance Of every inference of science! Fiends, I tell you to your faces, I will make you know your places! What! in public thus to fool us! A mob of ghosts, forsooth, to rule us! [The dancing goes on. To-night—why this is Goblin-hall, Spirits and spectres all in all. My comments—what are they?—the cavils, Of a sour cynic on his travels, A passing stranger's jealous spite. —But Time will set the matter right, Good sense assert its proper power, Dethrone the tyrant of the hour, And take revenge on my tormentors, Goblins, and ghosts, and ghost-inventors! Mephistopheles. He'll throw himself into a puddle: There will he, stupefying, muddle, Till leeches, clinging to his body, Are weary of their banquet bloody: For spirits sinking—spirits rising The one cure is phlebotomizing; Delusions vanish soon—the leech Diseases of the head can reach And cure them—biting on the breech.— Blue devils fade fast, and, disappearing, Smile on the sage with aspect cheering. The brain will thus correct and clear its Vague whims, and vexing thoughts of spirits. —Why have you quitted thus already Your sweet and captivating lady, Who sang so lovingly and well, And danced so— Faustus. Why, I fear to tell; But from her mouth, while she was singing, I saw a little red mouse springing. Mephistopheles. Why start at trifles, my good fellow? 'Tis well it was not grey or yellow. What can these dull suspicions profit? The mouse—why make a mountain of it? A pretty sort of reason this is To fly a loving lady's kisses. Faustus. And then I saw— Mephistopheles. What? Faustus. Look, Mephisto, there, See you far off, and shadow-like, a fair Pale form—a lovely girl—almost a child— Standing alone—with sweet eyes, sad and mild? She looks on us—she moves—she leaves the place— Her feet are bound—she slides with mournful pace. I cannot from my heart dispel the wild, Strange thought, that her's is my own Margaret's face. Mephistopheles. Repel that thought; 'tis but an idle trick Of heated fancy, and the form you see Is nothing but a magic mockery. To gaze on it most dangerous may be. Charmed by its marble stare, the blood grows thick And hardens into marble; but ere now You must have heard of pale Medusa's brow. Faustus. Ah, no! a corpse's eyes are those Whose lids no loving fingers close. 'Tis she—that form—that face—that breast So often to my bosom prest. Mephistopheles. Fool! 'tis delusion! every lover Would there his charmer's looks discover. Faustus. What mirth is here—and, oh! what grief—my glance Still—still returns to that pale countenance; And see around her neck a slender chain, That stripes the snowy skin with crimson stain: Scarce broader than a knife's thin edge it gleams— A strangely chosen ornament it seems. Mephistopheles. Yes, you are right; for I can see it too, —But think no more of it than others do. Be not surprised, if you should see her carry Her head under her arm—'twere like enough; For since the day that Perseus cut it off, Such things are not at all extraordinary. But see, all others here are pleasant; Cease moping, and enjoy the present: All round the hill is merriment— Try thou the same experiment. Never did crowded capital A gayer throng together call; And if my senses do not err, Yonder's an open theatre. —Well, what's your business? Servibilis. We are just beginning— 'Tis a new piece—the last of seven—seven is The customary number here—'twas written By a young amateur of fancy—the actors Are dilettanti all—your pardon, gentlemen, But I must vanish—I'm an amateur Myself—and for this one night draw the curtain. Mephistopheles. Blocksberg for ever!—not a player On earth but merits to be there!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A GLOOMY DAY.—A PLAIN. Faustus. In misery—in despair—long wandering in wretchedness over the wide world; and now taken up—shut up in the prison as a malefactor—this gentle, unhappy creature—for horrid tortures. To this—and has it come to this? Treacherous, worthless Spirit! and this hast thou been concealing from me! Stand, there, stand! Ay! roll the devil eyes furiously round in thy head— ay! stand and defy me with thy unsupportable presence. Taken up—in distress irretrievable— given over to evil spirits—abandoned to—man— man that passes judgment, and is devoid of feeling; and all this while you have been lulling and rocking me and deluding me among loathsome dissipations, and hiding from me her continually increasing wretchedness, and have left her to perish without help! Mephistopheles. She is not the first! Faustus. Dog! abhorred monster! turn him, oh, thou infinite Spirit, turn the reptile again into his dog's shape, in which it was often his pleasure to scamper before me by night, to roll before the feet of the unthinking passer-by, and as he fell to fasten on his shoulders. Turn him again into his darling shape, that he may crouch upon his belly before me in the sand, and that I may trample upon him with my foot—the outcast! Not the first! Misery—misery —by no human soul is it to be fathomed how more than one creature should have sunk into the depths of this distress—that the first should not have suffered enough in her agonising tortures to secure the atonement of all the rest before the eyes of the All-merciful! I feel marrow and life harrowed up by the misery of this one—only this one! thou art grinning calmly over the fate of thousands! Mephistopheles. At our wits' end we are again, it would seem, already—just where you mortals find the over-strained faculties snap. Why seek our society, if you cannot go through with it? Think of flying, and yet art not proof against dizziness! Did we force ourselves upon thee? or thou thyself upon us? Faustus. Show not thy thirsty teeth thus defyingly—I loathe thee. Great, glorious Spirit! thou who didst deign to appear to me, thou who knowest my very heart and soul, why hast thou chained me with this companion who feeds on mischief, and battens on destruction? Mephistopheles. Are you done? Faustus. Save her, or woe to thee! The most horrible curse on thee for thousands of years. Mephistopheles. I cannot loosen the avenger's fetters—I cannot open his bolts. Save her! Who was it that threw her into ruin—I or thou? [Faustus looks wildly around. Art thou grasping for the thunder? Well that it has not been given to you wretched mortals! To dash to pieces one who stands in your way, however innocent—that is just the tyrant's way of rescuing himself, or, at all events, venting his spite in every perplexity. Faustus. Take me thither—she shall be free! Mephistopheles. The danger to which you expose yourself—have you thought of that? The guilt of blood shed by your hand still lies on the town. Over the place where the murder was committed avenging spirits are hovering and watching for the returning murderer. Faustus. That, too, and from thee? Murder and death of a world upon thee, monster! Take me thither, I say, and set her at liberty. Mephistopheles. I will,—and all I can do I will. What that all is, listen till I tell you. Have I all power in heaven and on earth? I will cloud the gaoler's senses. Do you possess yourself of the keys, and carry her off with human hand. Meanwhile I watch; the magic horses are ready, and I take you away. This much I can do. Faustus. Up and away!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NIGHT.—OPEN PLAIN. Faustus and Mephistopheles rushing along on black horses. Faustus. What are the figures near the gibbet doing? Weaving, 'twould seem! Mephistopheles. No—rather boiling, brewing Some filthy broth—mumbling some incantation. Faustus. East they move, and west they move—now kneel, now bend down in prostration. Mephistopheles. Witches worshipping their master. Faustus. They scatter something on the earth, and now seem pouring a libation— They sprinkle something in the air. Mephistopheles. Forward! forward!—faster! faster!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRISON. Faustus (with a bunch of keys and a lamp, before an iron wicket). 'Tis many a day since I have trembled thus. Misery on misery heaped—a heavy burden, More than man can endure, has weighed me down. And here within these damp walls doth she live, And is to die because she was deluded— To die for that her brain was wild and frenzied. And thou dost hesitate to go to her! Dost fear to look upon that face again! Onward, irresolute!—this mad delaying Keeps death a lingerer here—secures his prey. [He takes hold of the lock.—Singing heard from within. Margaret's voice. Song. My mother! my mother! The wanton woman—My mother hath slain me. My father, inhuman, For supper hath ta'en me— My little sister hath, one by one, Laid together each small white bone, 'Mong almond blossoms to sleep in the cool; And I woke me a wood-bird beautiful. Fly away, fly away, all the long summer-day, Little bird of the woods, fly away! fly away! Faustus (opening the wicket). She feels not that her love is listening— Hears but the chains that clank, and the straw rustling. [He enters. Margaret (hiding her face in the straw of her bed). Woe! woe! they come! they come!—death, bitter death! Faustus (in a low voice). Hush! hush! 'tis I who come to rescue thee! Margaret (rolling herself at his feet). Art thou a man? Have pity upon me. Faustus. Hush! hush! these screams and shrieks will wake the keepers. [He takes hold of the chains to unlock them. Margaret (throwing herself on her knees to him). Savage, who gave this cruel power to thee? It is not more than midnight now—have mercy! Is it too long a time to wait till morn? And I am still so young—so very young! And must I die so soon?—and I was fair— And I was fair, and that was my undoing. Oh, if my love were here—but he is gone— Torn is my garland—scattered all its flowers— Oh, do no not grasp me with such violence— Ah, spare me! sure I have not injured thee: Let me not weep and pray to thee in vain! Spare me—I never saw thy face before. Faustus. How can I bear to see these sufferings? Margaret. I know that I am wholly in thy power— Only permit me once to give my breast To this poor child of mine: all the long night It lay upon my heart, they took it from me; They took away my child to torture me, And now they say that I have murdered it, And never more will I be gay and happy: And they sing songs about me—'twas ill done; It was ill done—so the old ballad runs. Who told them I was meant in it? Faustus. Thy lover, Margaret, kneels at thy feet; He comes to open these sad prison gates. Margaret. Let us kneel down, and call upon the saints. See! see! beneath us hell boils up—the devil Is raving there below in hideous rage! Faustus (in a low tone of voice). Margaret—Margaret. Margaret (with eager attention). That is my love's voice. [Springs up—her irons fall off. Where is he?—Where?—I heard my own love's voice! Now am I free, none, none shall keep me from him. I'll clasp his neck, will lean upon his bosom; I heard him call,—he's standing on the threshold,— I heard him call the name of Margaret;— Amid the noises and the howls of hell, And threats, and taunts, and laughs of devilish scorn, I heard my own love's voice—his loving voice! Faustus. 'Tis I. Margaret. 'Tis thou!—oh, tell me so once more! [Presses him to her bosom. 'Tis he, 'tis he—my pangs, where are they now? Dungeon, and chains, and scaffold, where are they? 'Tis thou, and thou hast come to rescue me. I am already free: look—there's the street Where we first met—where first I saw my love— And yonder is the cheerful garden, smiling, Where I and Martha used to wait for thee. Faustus. Come, come with me. Margaret. Oh, stay a little while— Some moments more—I love to stay with thee! Faustus. Haste, haste! ah, linger not, One moment more—a moment's lingering now Will cost—we cannot tell how much. Margaret. How! what! And hast thou then forgot that kiss of thine, My love? So short a time away, and yet To have forgotten all those signs of love! Why do I feel so sad upon thy neck? Oh, there was once a time when all thy words, And every glance of thine, seemed heaven to me. And warmly didst thou press me to thy heart! Oh, let me feel once more that loved embrace! Alas! thy lips are cold and dumb—ah, where, Where is thy love? Who robbed me of thy love? Faustus. Come, come—take courage, follow me, my love. I love thee with unutterable love; But follow me,—this one—this one request. Margaret. And is it thou, and art thou surely Faustus? Faustus. Yes, yes! But come! Margaret. And thou wilt break my chains! And thou wilt take me to thy arms again! How is it thou dost not shudder at my sight? And knowest thou whom thou art delivering? Faustus. Come, come!—the darkness of the night is fading. Margaret. My mother, I have murdered her—my child, I drowned my child—and was it not thy child, Thy child and mine? yes, thine! and thou art here, I scarcely can believe it is thyself. Give me thy hand—it is not then a dream; Thine own dear hand. Oh, God! his hand is moist— Wipe, wipe it off! methought it felt like blood! What hast thou done? Ah, sheath thy bloody sword; Ah, hide it from me. Faustus. Think not of the past; That which is done, is done. Come, this delay Is death to me! Margaret. No; thou must yet remain, Till I describe to thee the graves, which thou To-morrow must see made: the best place give To my poor mother; near her lay my brother; And by their side, a little space away, Place me; and on my right breast lay my child; No other will lie with me in that bed! To nestle down in quiet side by side To thee—oh what a happy thing it was— A happy thing that never more can be. I feel as if I forced myself on thee, And that thou wert repelling my embrace; And yet thou art the same—and yet thy looks Are good and kind, as they have ever been. Faustus. Oh, if thou feelest that 'tis I, come, come. Margaret. Come! Whither? Faustus. From this prison to thy freedom. Margaret. Ay, to the grave—does not death lurk without? Come to the bed of everlasting rest— Yes, yes—that's all—that's all—not a step farther— And art thou leaving me? may I go with thee? Faustus. Come, come; the gates are open, only come. Margaret. I dare not go; there is no help for me. What good is it to fly? My steps are watched. It is a hard thing to be forced to beg, And harder, harassed by an evil conscience. 'Tis hard to wander in a foreign land, And then, whate'er I do, at last they'll seize me. Faustus. I will be with thee. Margaret (wildly). Fly, fly, Save thy poor child; Away to the road, By the side of the stream, And across the path That leads to the wood; Then turn to the left, And over the plank, He lies in the pond. Loiter not, linger not, Still does he stir With the motion of life. His little hands struggle More faintly and faintly, Rescue him! rescue him! Faustus. Recall thy wandering mind—thy life's at stake. One step, and thou art free. Margaret. Oh, that we once had left yon hill behind! See there, my mother sitting on a stone— Icy-cold comes a dead hand on my temples. My mother there is sitting on a stone, And her grey head is trembling, and her eyes Close, and she now has ceased to nod; her head Looks heavy, and she sleeps too long—too long— Oh, when she sank to sleep how blest we were! It was a happy time! Faustus. She listens not; Words have no weight with her; there is no way, But forcibly to bear her hence. Margaret. Touch me not; no, I will not suffer violence: Seize me not with that murderer's grasp; whate'er I did was done for thee, my love. I did Every thing my love asked me, willingly. Faustus. Day dawns—oh, hasten hence, my love! my love! Margaret. Day! yes, 'tis day, the last, the judgment-day; My bridal-day it should have been; tell none That thou hast been with poor weak Margaret. Alas! my garland is already withered; We'll meet again, but not at dances, love: The crowd is gathering tumultuously, The square and street are thronged with crushing thousands; The bell hath sounded; the death-wand is broken; They bind and blindfold me, and force me on: On to the scaffold they have hurried me; Down in the chair of blood they fasten me: And now, through every neck of all that multitude Is felt the bitter wound that severs mine. The world is now as silent as the grave! Faustus. Oh, that I never had been born! Mephistopheles (appears at the door). Away, or you are lost; This trembling, and delay, and idle chattering, Will be your ruin; hence, or you are lost; My horses shiver in the chilling breeze Of the grey morning. Margaret. What shape is that which rises from the earth? 'Tis he, 'tis he, oh, send him from this place; What wants he here? Oh, what can bring him here? Why does he tread on consecrated ground? He comes for me. Faustus. Oh, thou shalt live, my love. Margaret. Upon the judgment-throne of God, I call; On God I call in humble supplication. Mephistopheles (to Faustus). Come, or I leave thee here to share her fate. Margaret. Father of heaven, have mercy on thy child. Ye angels, holy hosts, keep watch around me. Henry—I am afraid to look at thee. Mephistopheles. Come—she is judged! Voice (from above). Is saved. Mephistopheles (to Faustus). Hither to me! [Disappears with Faustus. Voice (from within dying away). Henry! Henry!</field>
