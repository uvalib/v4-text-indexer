      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Alphonso, Curio, Seberto. Curio. Signor Alphonso, ye are too rugged to her, Believe too full of harshnesse. Al. Yes, it seemes so. Seb. A father of so sweet a child, so happy, (Fy Sir) so excellent in all endowments, In blessednesse of beauty, such a mirror. Alp. She is a foole, away. Seb. Can ye be angry? Can any wind blow rough, upon a blossom So faire, and tender? Can a Fathers nature, A noble Fathers too? Al. All this is but prating: Let her be rul'd; let her observe my humor, With my eyes let her see; with my eares listen; I am her Father: I begot her, bred her, And I will make her. Cur. No doubt ye may compell her, But what a misceivous, unhappy fortune May wayt upon this wil of yours, as commonly Such forcings ever end in hates, and ruines. Al. Is't not a man I wish her to? a strong man? What can she have? what could she have? a Gentleman? A yong man? and an able-man? a rich man? A handsome man? a valiant man? do you marke me? None of your peeced-companions, your pin'd-Gallants, That flie to fitters, with every flaw of weather: None of your impt bravados: what can she ask more? Is not a mettal'd-man fit for a woman? A strong chindman? i'le not be foold, nor flurted. Seb. I grant ye Rodorgio is all these And a brave Gentleman: must it therefore follow Upon necessity she must doate upon him? Will ye allow no liberty in choosing? Cur. Alas she is tender yet. Al. Enough enough, enough Sir: She is malliable; shee'l endure the hammer, And why not that strong workeman that strikes deepest? Let me know that? she is fifteen, with the vantage, And if she be not ready now for mannageâ Seb. You know he is a banish'd man: an out-Law; And how he lives: his nature rough, and bloody By customary rapines: now, her sweet humor That is as easy as a calme, and peacefull, All her affections, like the dewes on Roses, Faire as the flowers themselves: as sweet, and gentle: How would you have these meet? Al. A bed, a bed sir: Let her be the fairest Rose, and the sweetest, Yet I know this faire rose must have her prickles: I grant ye Rodorigo is an out-Law, An easie composition cals him in again, He is a valiant man, and he is a rich man, And loves the foole: a little rough by custome: Shee'l like him ten times better. Shee'l do at upon him, If ere they come to grapling, run mad for him; But there is an other in the wind, some castrell That hovers over her, and dares her dayly, Some flickring slave. Cur. I dare not think so poorely. Al. Something there is, and must be: but I shall sente it And hunt it narrowly. Seb. I never saw her yet Make offer at the least glance of affection, But still so modest, wise. Al. They are wise to gull us, There was a fellow, old Ferandos son, I must confesse handsome, but my enemy, And the whole family, I hate yong Pedro: That fellow I have seen her gaze upon, And turn, and gaze again, and make such offers As if she would shoot her eyes like meteors at him: But that cause stands removed. Cur. You need not doubt him, For long since as 'twas thought on a griev'd conscience, He left his father, and his friends: more pitty: For truth reports he was a noble Gentleman. Al. Let him be what he wil: he was a begger, And there i'le leave him. Seb. The more the Court must answer; But certainly I think, though she might favour him, And love his goodnesse, as he was an honest man: She never with loose eyes stuck on his person. Al. She is so full of conscience too, and charity, And outward holinesse, she will undoe me: Relieves more beggers, then an hospitall; En. Alinda, and Juletta. And all poor rogues, that can but say their prayers, And tune their pipes to Lamentations, She thinks she is bound to dance to: good morrow to you, And that's as ye deserve too: you know my mind, And studdy to observe it: doe it cheerfully, And readily, and home. Alin. I shall obey ye. But noble sir. Al. Come, come, away with your flatteries, And your fine phrases, Cur. Pray ye be gentle to her: Al. I know 'em; and know your feates: if you will find me Noble and loving, seek me in your duty, You know I am too indulgent. Seb. Alas poor Lady. Al. To your devotions: I take no good thing from you Come Gentlemen; leave pittying, and moaning of her, And praysing of her vertues: and her whym-whams, It makes her proud, and sturdy: Seb., Cur. Good houres wait on ye. Exeunt Alin. I thank ye Gentlemen: I want such comforts: I would thank you too father: but your cruelty Hath almost made me senselesse of my duty, Yet still I must know: would J had known nothing; What Poor attend my charity to day, wench? Jul. Of all sorte, Madam; your open handed bounty Makes 'em flock every houre: some worth your pitty, But others that have made a trade of begging. Alin. Wench, if they ask it truly, I must give it: It takes away the holy use of charity To examine wants. Jul. I would you would be merry: A cheerfull-giving hand, as I think, Madam, Requires a heart as cheerfull. Alin. Alas Iuletta, What is there to be merry at? what joy now, Unlesse we foole our own afflictions, And make them shew ridiculous? Jul. Sure Madam, You could not seeme thus serious, if you were married, Thus sad, and full of thoughts. Alin. Married? to whom, wench? Thou thinkst if there be a yong handsome fellow As those are plentifull, our cares are quenched then. Iul. Madam, I think a lusty handsome fellow If he be kind, and loving, and a right one, Is even as good a pill, to purge this melancholy, As ever Galen gave, I am sure more naturall: And merrier for the heart, then Wine and Saffron: Madam, wantone youth is such a Cataplasme. Alin. Who has bin thy tutor wench? Jul. Even my own thoughts, Lady: For though J be bard the liberty of talking, Yet I can think unhappily, and as near the mark, Madam, 'Faith, marry, and be merry. Alin. Who wil have me? Who wil be troubled with a tettish Girle? It may be proud, and to that vice expencefull? Who can assure himselfe, I shall live honest? Jul. Let every man take his fortune: Alin. And o' my conscience If once I grow to breeding, a whole Kingdome Wil not containe my stock. Jul. The more the merrier: 'Tis brave to be a mother of new Nations. Alin. Why, I should bury a hundred husbands. Iul. Tis no matter: As long as ye leave sufficient men to stock ye. Alm. Is this thy mirth? are these the joyes of marriage? Away light-headed foole; are these contentments? If I could finde a man. Jul. You may a thousand. Alin. Meere men I know I may: and there a woman Has liberty, (at least shee'l venture for it,) To be a monster and become the time too; But to enjoy a man, from whose example (As from a compasse) we may steer our fortunes, Our actions, and our age; and safe arive at A memory that shall become our ashes, Such things are few, and far to seek; to finde one That can but rightly mannage the wild beast, woman, And sweetly govern with her. But no more of this, wench, Tis not for thy discourse: Lets in, and see What poor afflicted wait our charity. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter a Porter, 4. Beggers, Pedro, and a Pilgrime. Por. Stand off, and keep your Rancks: twenty foot further: There louse your selves with reason, &amp; discretion. The Sun shines warm: the farther still the better, Your beasts wil bolt anon, and then tis dangerous. 1. Beg. Heaven blesse our Mistris. Por. Does the crack go that way? 'Twil be o'th o'ther side anon. 2. Pray ye friend. Por. Your friend? and why your friend? why, goodman turncoat What dost thou see within me, or without me, Or what itch dost thou know upon me, tell me, That I should be thy friend? what do I look like Any of thy acquaintance hoong in Gibbets? Hast thou any Friends, Kindred, or Alliance, Or any higher ambition, then an almes-basket? 2. Beg. I would be your worships friend. Por. So ye shall Sirra, When I quarter the same louse with ye. 3. Tis twelve o' clock. Por. Tis ever so with thee, when thou hast done scratching, For that provokes thy stomach to ring noon; O the infinite Seas of porridge thou hast swallowd! And yet thou lookst as if they had bin but Glisters; Thou feedst abundance; thou hadst need of sustenance; Almes do you call it to relieve these Rascals? Enter Alphonso, Curio, Seberto. Nothing but a generall rot of sheep can satisfie 'em. Al. Did not I tel you, how she would undo me? What Marts of Rogues, and Beggers? Seb. Tis charity Methinks, you are bound to love her forâ Al. Yes, I warrant ye, If men could sale to heaven in porridge pots, With masts of Beef, and Mutton, what a voyage should I make? What are all these? 1. Poore people, and 't like your worship. 2. Wretched poor people. 3. Very hungry people. Al. And very Lousy. 4. Yes forsooth, so, so. Por. I'le undertake five hundred head about 'em, And that's no needy Grasier. Al. What are you? Pil. Strangers that come to wonder at your charity, Yet people poore enough to beg a blessing. Cur. Use them with favour, sir, their shews are reverent, It seemes ye are holy Pilgrimes? Pil. Ye ghesse right sir, And bound far off, to offer our devotions. Al. What make ye this way? we keep no Reliques here, Nor holy Shrines. Pil. The holiest we ere heard of; Ye keep a living monument of goodnesse, A Daughter of that pious excellence, The very Shrines of Saints sinck at her vertues, And swear they cannot hold pace with her pieties, We come to see this Lady: not with prophane eyes, Nor wanton bloods, to do at upon her beauties, But through our tedious wayes to beg her blessings. Al. This is a new way of begging, and a neat one, And this cries money for reward: good store too; These commendations beg not with bag, and bottle; Well, well, the sainting of this woman (Gentlemen) I know what it must come too: these women saints Are plaguy heavy saints: they out-waigh a he-saint Three thousand thick; I know: I feele. Seb. Ye are more afraid then hurt sir. Al. Have you your commendations ready too? He bowes, and nods. Cur. A handsome well built person. Al. What Country-craver are you? nothing but motion? A puppet-Pilgrim? Pil. Hee's a stranger sir; This foure dayes I have traveld in his company, But little of his busines, or his Language As yet, I have understood. Seb. Both yong, and handsome, Only the Sun has bin too saucy with him. Al. Would ye have money sir, or meat? what kind of blessing Does your devotion looke for? Still more ducking? Be there any saints, that understand by signes only? More motion yet? this is the prettiest Pilgrim, The pinck of pilgrims: ile be for ye sir; Do ye discourse with signes? ye are hartly wel come: A poor viaticum; very good gold sir; But holy men affect a better treasure. I kept it for your goodnes, but neerthelesse Since it can prove but burthensome to your holines, And you affect light prayer, fit for carriage, I'le put this up againe. Cur. Ye are too unreverent. Al. Ye talk too broad; must I give way, and wealth too To every toy, that carries a grave seeming? Must my good angels wait on him? if the proud hilding Would yeild but to my wil, and know her duty I knew what I would suffer. Seb. Good sir, be patient, The wrongs ye do these men, may light on you, Too heavy too: and then you wil wish you had said lesse; A comly and sweet usage becomes strangers. Al. We shall have half the Kingdom strangers shortly, And this fond prodigality be sufferd; But I must be an asse, see 'hem relieved, sirah; If I were yong again, I would sooner get beare whelps, And safer too, them any of these She-saints, But I will break her, Cur. Such a face for certain. Seb. Me thinks I have seen it too: but we are cozend; But fair befall thee Pilgrim, thou lookst lovely. Exit. Por. Will ye troop up, ye porridge Regiment? Enter Alinda Iuletta. Captain Poors quarter wil ye move? Alin. Ye dull Knave, Are not these wretches served yet? Beg. 'Blesse my Mistris. Alin. Do you make sport sir, with their miseries? Ye drousie rogue. Por. They are too high fed, Madam, Their stomacks are a'sleep yet. Alin. Serve 'hem plentifully, Or i'le serve you out next: even out o' dores, sirah; And serve 'em quickly too. Beg. Heaven blesse the Lady. Alin. Blesse the good end I meane it for. Jul. I would I knew it: If it be for any mans sake, i'le cry amen too, Well Madam, ye have even as pretty a port of pentioners. Alin. Vain-glory would seek more, and handsomer. Ex. But I appeale to vertue what my end is; Beggers What men are these? Jul. It seems they are holy Pilgrims: That handsome youth should suffer such a pennance, Would I were even the saint they make their vowes too, How easily I would grant. Pil. Heavens grace in-wheele ye: And all good thoughts, and prayers dwell about ye, Abundance be your friend; and holy charity Be ever at your hand' to crown ye glorious. Alin. I thank ye sir; peace guid your travels too, And what you wish for most, end all your trobles; Remember me by this: and in your prayers When your strong heart melts, mediate my poor fortunes. Pil. All my devotions wait upon your service. Alin. Are ye of this Country, sir? Pil. Yes, worthiest Lady, But far off bred: my fortunes farther from me. Alin. Gentle, I dare believe. Pil. I have liv'd freer. Alin. I am no inquisitor, that were too curious: What ever vow, or pennance puls ye on sir; Conscience, or love, or stubborn disobedience, The saint ye kneel too, hear, and ease your travels. Pil. Yours neer begin: and thus I seal my prayers. Ex. Alin. How constantly this man looks? how he sighes? Some great affliction hatches his devotions, Right holy sir: how yong, and sweet he suffers? Iul. Would I might suffer with him. Alin. He turns from us: Alas he weeps too: something presses him He would reveale, but dare not; sir, be comforted, Ye come for that: and take it: if it be want, sir, To me yee appear so worthy of relieving, I am your steward: speak, and take: he's dumb still: Now as I have a faith this man so stirs me, His modesty makes me affraid I have trespassed. Iul. Would he would stir me too: I like his shape well. Alin. May be he would speak alone: go off Iuletta, Afflicted hearts fear their own motions, Be not far off. Iul. Would I were neerer to him, A yong smug handsome holines has no fellow. Exit Alin. Why do you grieve? do you find your pennance sharp? O rare the vowes ye have made, too mighty for ye? Do's not the world allure ye to look back And sorrow for the sweet time ye have lost? Ye are yong, and fair; be not deluded, sir; A manly made up heart contemnes these shadows, And yours appeares no lesse: greifes for your fears, For houres ill-spent, for wrongs don rash, and rudely, For fowle contempts for faiths ill violated, Become fears well: I dare not task your Goodnes: And then a sorrow shewes in his true glory VVhen the whole heart is excellently sorry. I pray ye be comforted. Ped. I am, deer Lady, And such a comfort ye have cast upon me, That though I struggle with mine own calamities Too mighty, and too many for my mannage, And though, like angry waves, they curld upon me Contending proudly who should first devour me, Yet I would stem their danger. Alin. He speaks nobly: What do ye want? Ped. All that can make me happy: I want my selfe. Alin. Your self? who rob'd ye Pilgrim? Why does he look so constantly upon me? I want my selfe: indeed, you holy wounderers Are said to seek much: but to seek your selves. Ped. I seek my self; and am but my selfs-shadow: Have lost my self; and now am not so noble. Alin. I seek my self: something I yet remember That bears that Motto; 'tis not he: he is yonger, And far more tender: for that self-sake (Pilgrim) Be who it will, take this. Ped. Your hand I dare take, That be far from me, Lady, thus I kisse it, And thus I blesse it too; be constant fair still: Be good, and live to be a great example. Exit. Alin. One word more (Pilgrim) has amazd me strangly, Be constant faire still: tis the posie here: And here without, Be good: he wept to see me Enter Iuletta Juletta: Iul. Madam. Alin. Take this Key, and fetch me The Marygold Jewell that lies in my little Cabinet: I think tis that: what eyes had I, to misse him? O' me, what thoughts? he had no beard then, and As I remember well, he was more ruddy. En Iuletta If this be he, he has a manly face yet A goodly shape. Iul. Here Madam? Alin. Let me see it: Tis so, too true: It must be he, or nothing, He spak the words just as they stand engraved here: I seek my self, and am but my selfes-shadow: Alas poor man: didst thou not meet him, Iuletta? The Pilgrim wench? Iul. He went by long ago, Madam. Alin. I forgot to give him something. Iul. 'Twas ill done Lady: For, o' my troth, he is the handsomest man I saw this many a day: would he had all my wealth, And me to boote: what ayles she to grow sullen? Alin. Come, I forgot: but I will recompence it. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Alphonso, Curio, Seberto, Iuletta, Porter, and servants. Al. Can she slip through a cat-hole? tell me that: resolve me; Can she fly ith ayre? is she a thing invisible? Gon, and none know it? Seb. Ye amaz your servants. Al. Some pelting rogue has watch'd her houre of itching, And clawd her; clawd her: do you mark me, clawd her; Some that I foster up. Cur. They are all here, sir. Al. Let 'em be where they will, they are arrant rascals, And by this hand i'le hang 'em all. Seb. Deale calmely: You will not give 'em time to answer ye. Al. I'le choak 'hem: famish 'em: what say you wagtaile? You knew her mind: you were of councell with her, Tell me: and tell me true. Cur. Aske with discretion. Al. Discretion? hang discretion, hang ye all: Let me know where she is. Iul. Would you know o' me sir? Al. O' thee sir: I, o' thee sir: what art thou sir? Iul. Hir woman sir, and 't like your worship, sir. Al. Her band, her fidle-stick. Her Lady-fayry, to oyl the dores o' nights, That they may open with discretion, Her Gin, her Nut-crack, Iul. Tis very well sir. Al. Thou liest; tis damnabIe ill, tis most abhominable: Will ye confes (Thing) Iul. Say I were gulty, sir? I would be hangd before I would confesse: Is this a World to confesse in? Cur. Deale directly. Iul. Yes, if my matter lie direct before me: But when I am forc'd, and ferryted. Al. Tell me the truth, And as I live, i'le give thee a new petticote. Jul. And you would give me ten, I would not tell ye, Truths bear a greater price, then you are aware of. Seb. Deale modestly. Iul. I doe not pluck my cloths up. Al. What say you sirha? you? or you? are ye dumb all? Por. I saw her last night, and't shall like your worship When I serv'd in her Livery. Al. What's that, sirha? Por. Her Chamber pot, and't please ye. Seb. A new Livery. Al. Where lay she? who lay with her? Por. In truth not I sir: I lay with my fellow Fredrick, in the flea-chamber And't like your worship, we are almost worried. Iul. I left her by her self, in her own closet, And there I thought she had slept. Al. Why lay you from her? Iu. It was her will I should: she is my Mistris, And my part is obedience. Al. Were all the dores lockt? Por. All mine. Ser. And mine: she could not get out those wayes Unles she lept the wals: and those are higher Then any womans courage dare aspire at. Al. Come, you must know. Cur. Conceale it not, but deale plaine. Iul. If I did know, and her trust lay upon me, Not all your angers, nor your flatteries Should make me speak, but having no more interest Then I may well deliver to the aire, I'le tell ye what I know: and tell it liberally, I think she is gon, because we cannot find her; I think she is weary of your tyranny, And therefore gon: may be she is in love: May be in love, where you show no great liking, And therefore gon: May be, some point of conscience, Or vowd devotion. Al. These are nothing, minion; You that can aime at these, must know the truth too. Iul. Any more truth then this if I know hang me, Or where to search for it, if I make a lie To gaine your love, and envy my best Mistris, Pin me against a wall, with my heel's upwards. Al. Out of my dores. Iul. That's all my poor petition: For if your house were gold, and she not in it, Sir, I should count it but a cage to whistle in. Al. Whore, if she be above ground, I wil have her. Iul. I would live in a cole-pit, then, were I your daughter. Seb. Certaine she dos not know Sir. Al. Hang her, hang her: She knowes too much: search all the house; all corners, And where tis possible she may goe out, Ex. servants. If I do finde your tricks. Jul. Reward me for 'hem. Or if I had such tricks, you could discover So weak, and sleightly woven, you might look through, All the young Girles should hoot me out oth' Parish. You are my Master, but ye owne an anger Becomes a School-boy, that hath lost his Apples; Will ye force things into our knowledges? Al. Come hither Juletta; thou didst love me. Jul. And do still: You are my Ladies father, and I reverence ye. Al. Thou wouldst have pleas'd my humor. Jul. Any good way, That carried not suspition in't: or flattery, Or faile of trust. Al. Come, come, thou wouldst have.â Jul. Stay sir. Al. And thou hast felt my bounty for't, and shalt doe. Dost thou want Clothes or Money? Jul. Both. Al. Shalt have both. Jul. But not this way: I had rather be an Adamite And bring Fig-leaves into fashion again. If you were young sir, Handsome, and fitted to a womans appetite; And I a giddy-headed girle, that car'd for nothing, Much might be done; then you might fumble with me, And thinke to grope out matters of some moment, Which now you will put too short for: For what you have seen hitherto, And know by me, has been but honest service, Which I dare pin ith' market-place to answer; And let the world, the flesh and divell examine it, And come you in too, I dare stand your strictest. And so much good may doe you, with your dreames of curtesie. Al. This is most monstrous. Enter Porter and Servants. Seb. Sure she do's not know sir: She durst not be so confident and guilty. Al. How now; what newes? what hopes and steps discovered? Speake any thing thats good, that tends to th'matter; Doe you stand staring still? 1 Ser. We are no Gods sir, To say she is here, or there: and what she is doing; But we have search'd. Por. I am sure she is not ith' Cellar; For looke you sir, if she had been ith' Cellarâ Al. I am sure thou hast been there. Por. As I carried the matter, For I search'd every piece of Wine; yes sure sir, And every little Teresse that could but testifie: And I drew hard to bolt her out. Al. Away with him; Fling him ith' Haymow, let him lie a mellowing; He stinks of Muskadel like an English Christmas: Are these your cares? your services? 2 Ser. Pray ye heare sir, We have found where she went out; her very footing. Al. Where where? goe on. Cur. Observe then with more staiednesse. 2 Ser. Searching the garden: at the little Posterne That opens to the Parke, we first discovered it. Al. A little foot? 1 Ser. It must be hers, or none sir. Al. How far beyond that? 2 Ser. To the Parke it leads us, But there the ground being hard, we could not marke it. Al. She alwaies kept that Key: I was a coxcomb, A foole, an asse, to give a girle that liberty: Saddle my Horses, rogues, ye drunken varlets: Your precious diligence lies in Pint-pots, Your brains in Butts, my horses, ye pin-buttocks. You'l beare me company? Seb. We dare not leave ye, Unlesse we found a quieter soule within ye. Cur. If we may do the Lady any service, Sweet, gentle soule. Al. I say againe, my horses: Are ye so hot? have ye your private pilgrimages? Must ye be Jumping-Jone? Ile wander with ye: Ile jump ye, and Ile joggle ye: my horses; And keep me this young Lirry-poope within dores, I will discover, dame. Jul. 'Tis fit you should sir, If ye knew what: Well Love, if thou bee'st with her, Or what power else that armes her resolution, Conduct her faire, and keepe her from this mad man, Direct her to her wishes: dwell about her That no dishonourable end ore-take her, Danger, or want: and let me try my fortune. Al. You know the place we meet in? Seb. We shall hit it. Al. And as ye are honest Gentlemen, endeavour. Cur. We'l search the best we can: if she light in our hands. Al. Tie her to th'horse taile. Seb. We know how to use her, But not your way, for all your state. Al. Make haste there: And get you in, and looke to th'house. If you stir out, Damsell, Or set o'foot any new motion this way, When I come home, (which shall be suddenly) You know my mind: if you doe play the rascall, I have my eyes and eares in sundry places, If ye doe praunce. Jul. I shall doe that, that's fit, sir: And fit to crosse your fooleries; Ile faile else. And so Ile to my chamber. Exit. Al. To your prayers, And leave your stubborne tricks: She is not far yet, She cannot be; and we dividing suddenly. Cur. Keep her from thy hands, I beseech. Al. Our horses; Come cheerfully. Ile teach her to run gadding. Exit. Scena secunda. Enter Roderigo, and foure Out-lawes. 1 Out-l. Captaine, y'are not merry. Rod. We get nothing, We have no sport; whoring, and drinking spoiles us, We keep no guards. 2. There come no passengers, Merchants, nor Gentlemen, nor whosoever, But we have Tribute. Rod. And whilst we spend that idlely, We let those passe that carry the best purchase. Ile have all search'd &amp; brought in; Rogues, and Beggars, Have got the tricke now to become Banck-masters. Ile have none scape: onely my friends, and neighbours, That may deliver to the King my innocence; Those I would have regarded; tis policy. But otherwise nor gravities, nor shadows, Appeare they how they will, that may have purses, For they shall pay. 3. Ye speake now like a Captaine. And if we spare, flea us, and coyn our Cassoks; Will ye looke blith? Rod. You heare no preparation The King intends against us yet? 4. Not a word sir. Good man, he's troubled with matter of more moment, Hummings of higher nature vex his braines, sir; Doe not we fee his garrisons? Rod. Who are out now? 4. Good fellows sir, that if there be any purchase stirring Will strike it dead; Jaques and Loper, Lads That know their quarters, as they know their knapsaks; And will not off. Rod. Where is the boy ye brought me? A pretty lad, and of a quicke capacity, And bred up neatly. 1. He's within at meat, sir, The knave is hungry: yet he seasons all He eates or drinkes with many teares and sighings, The saddest appetite I ever look'd on; The boy is young, tis feare and want of company He knows and loves: use him not rough, nor harshly, He will be quickly bold; Ile entertaine him: I want a pretty Boy to waite upon me, And when I am sad or sleepy, to prate to me; Besides there's something in his face, I like well. And still the more I looke, more like; let him want nothing, And use him gently, all. 2. Here's a small Box, sir, We tooke about him, which he griev'd to part with, May be some wealth. Rod. Alas, some little money The poore knave carried to defray his lodgings, Ile give it him againe, and adde unto it. 'Twere sin to open such a petty purchase. Enter Loper and Jaques, with Pedro. How now, who is this? what have you brought me Souldiers? Lop. We know not wel what: a strange staving fellow, Sullen enough I am sure. Rod. Where tooke ye him? Jaq. Upon the skirt o'th wood, veiwing, and gaping, And sometime standing still, as if he had meant To view the best accesses to our quarters; Money he has enough: and when we threatned him, He smil'd, and yeilded; but not one word utter'd. Lop. His habit saies he's holy: if his heart Keep that proportion too, 'tis best ye free him, We keep his Wallet here: I am sure tis heavy. Rod. Pilgrime: come hither sir; Are you a Pilgrime? A piece of pretty holinesse: doe you shrinke sir? A smug young Saint. What Countrey were you born in? Ye have a Spanish face: In a dumb Province? And had your mother too this excellent vertue? No tongue do you say? sure she was a matchlesse woman; What a fine family is this man sprung from! Certaine he was begotten in a calme, When all was husht: the Midwife was dumb Midnight; Are ye seal'd up? or doe you scorne to answer? Ye are in my hands, and I have medicines for ye Can make ye speake: pull off his Bonnet, Souldiers; Ye have a speaking face. Lop. I am sure a handsome: This Pilgrime cannot want She-Saints to pray to. Rod. Stand neerer: ha? Ped. Come, do your worst; I am ready. Rod. Is your tongue found? go off, and let me talk with him; And keepe your watches round. All. We are ready Captaine. Rod. So: now what are ye? Ped. Am I? My habit shewes me what I am. Rod. Thy heart A desperate foole, and so thy fate shall tell thee; What devill brought thee hither? for I know thee. Ped. I know thou dost: and since it is my fortune To light into thy fingers; I must thinke too The most malicious of all devils brought me, Yet some men say thou art Noble. Rod. Not to thee, That were a benefit to mocke the giver: Thy father hates my friends, and family, And thou hast been the heire of all this malice. Can two such stormes meet then, and part with kissing? Ped. You have the mightier hand. Rod. And so Ile use it. Ped. I cannot hinder ye: lesse can I beg Submissive at his knees that knows not honour; That bears the stamp of man, and not his nature; Ye may doe what ye please. Rod. I will doe all. Ped. And when you have done all, which is my poore ruine, (For farther your base malice cannot venture) Dishonours selfe will cry you out a coward. Hadst thou been brave, and noble and an Enemy, Thou wouldst have sought me whilst I carried Armes, Whilst my good Sword was my profession, And then have cried out Pedro, I defie thee; Then stuck Alphonso's quarrell on the point, The mercenary anger thou serv'st under To get his daughter. Then thou shouldst have brav'd me, And arm'd with all thy families hate upon me, Done something worthy feat: Now poore and basely Thou setst Toyles to betray me; and like the Pesant, That dares not meet the Lyon in the face, Digst crafty pit-fals: Thou sham'st the Spanish honour: Thou hast neither poynt of man, nor conscience in thee. Rod. Sir, sir, y'are brave; ye plead now in a Sanctuary; You think your Pilgrimes bulwarke can defend ye: You will not finde it so. Ped. I looke not for't. The more unhallowed soule hast thou to offer it. Rod. When you were bravest, sir, and your Sword sharpest, I durst affront ye: when the Court Sunne guilded ye, And every cry was the young hopefull Pedro, Alonsos sprightly sonne; then durst I meet ye, When you were Master of this fame, and fashion, And all your glories in the full Meridian, The Kings proof-favour buckled on your body; Had we then come to competition, Which I have often sought. Ped. And I desired too. Rod. You should have seen this Sword, how ere you sleight it, And felt it too; sharper then sorrow felt it, In execution quicker then thy scornes; Thou shouldst have seen all this, and shrunke to see it. Then like a Gentleman I would have us'd thee, And given thee the faire fortune of thy being, Then with a Souldiers Arme I had honour'd thee; But since thou stealst upon me like a Spie, And thiefe-like thinkst that holy case shall carry thee Through all my purposes, and so betray me, Base as you act, thy end be, and I forget thee. Ped. What poore evasions thou buildst on, to abuse me? The goodnesse of a man nere taught these principles. I come a Spie? durst any Noble spirit Put on this habit, to become a Traitor? Even in an Enemy shew me this antipathy Where there is Christian faith, and this not reverenced: I come a Spie? no Roderigo, no, A hater of thy person, a maligner? So far from that, I brought no malice with me, But rather when I meet thee, teares to soften thee; When I put on this habit, I put off All fires, all angers, all those starts of youth That clapt too ranke a biasse to my being, And drew me from the right marke all should aime at; In stead of stubborne steele, I put on prayers; For rash and hasty heats, a sweet repentance: Long weary steps, and vows, for my vain-glories. O Roderigo. Rod. If thy tongue could save thee, Prating be thy baile, thou hast a rare benefit. Souldiers, come out, and bring a halter with ye; Ile forgive your holy habit sir, but Ile hang you. Enter Outlaws, Loper, Jaques. 1 Out-l. Wherefore this halter Captaine? Rod. For this traytor. Go, put it on him, and then tie him up: 1. Do you want a Band sir? this is a course wearing, Twill sit but scurvily upon this collar; But patience is as good as a French Pickadell. Lop. What's his fault, Captaine? Rod. Tis my will he perish, And thats his fault. Ped. A Captaine of good government. Come Souldiers, come, ye are roughly bred, and bloody, Shew your obedience, and the joy ye take In executing impious commands; Ye have a Captaine seales your liberall pardons, Be no more Christians, put religion by, Twill make ye cowards: feele no tendernesse, Nor let a thing call'd conscience trouble ye; Alasse, twill breed delay. Beare no respect To what I seem: were I a Saint indeed, Why should that stagger ye? you know not holinesse: To be excellent in evill, is your goodnesse; And be so, twill become ye: have no hearts, For feare you should repent: that will be dangerous: For if there be a knocking there, a pricking, And that pulse beate backe to your considerations, How ye have laid a stiffe hand on Religionâ Rod. Trusse him I say. Ped. And violated faith, Rod. heare him not prate. Ped. Why, what a thing will this be? What strange confusion then will breed among ye? Rod. Will none of ye obey? Ped. What devils vex ye? The feares ye live in and the hourely dangers Will be delights to these: those have their ends, But these outlive all time, and all repentance: And if it creep into your conscience once, Be sure ye locke that close. Rod. Why stand ye gazing? Ped. Farewell sleep, peace, all that are humane comforts, Better ye had been Trees, or Stones, and happier; For those die here, and seeke no further being, Nor hopes, nor punishments. Rod. Rots take ye Rascals. Jaq. What would you have us do? Rod. Dispatch the prater. Jaq. And have religious blood hang on our consciences? We are bad enough already: sins enough To make our graves even loath us. Rod. No man love me? Lop. Although I be a thiefe, I am no hangman; They are two mens trades, and let another execute. Lay violent hands on holy things? Rod. Base Cowards, Put to your powers, ye Rascals, I command ye. Holy, or unholy, if I say it, Ile have it done. 1 Out-l. If I do't, let me starve for't. 2. Or I. 3. Or I: we will obey things handsome, And bad enough, and over doe obedience: But to be made such instruments of mischiefe. Jaq. I have done as many villanies as another, And with as little reluctation, Let me come cleare of these, and wipe that score off. Put me upon a felt and known perdition? Rod. Have ye conspir'd, ye slaves? Ped. How vildly this showes, In one that would command anothers temper, And beare no bound in's own? Rod. Am I thus jaded? Ped. Is it my life thou long'st for Roderigo? And can no sacrifice appease thy malice, But my blood spilt? doe it thy selfe, dispatch it; And as thou takst the whole revenge unto thee, Take the whole sin upon thee; and be mighty, Mighty in evill, as thou art in anger: And let not these poore wretches houle for thy sake. Those things that in thine owne glasse seeme most monstrous, Wouldst thou abuse their weak sights with, for amiable? Is it, thou thinkst to feare me with thy terrors, And into weake condition draw my vertue? If I were now to learn to die I would sue to thee: Or did I feare death, then I would make thee glorious. But knowing what, and how far I can suffer; And all my whole life being but deaths preface, My sleep but at next doore. Rod. Are ye so valiant? Ile make ye feele: Ile make ye know, and feele too; And Rascals, you shall tremble. Keepe him here, And keep him safe too: if he scape your guardsâ Ped. Feare not, I will not. Rod. As I live, ye die for't; I will not be thus baffled. Exit. Ja. What a divel have ye done, Pilgrim? or what mischief Have you conspir'd, that he should rage and rave thus? Have you kild his father, or his mother? or strangled any of his kindred? Lop. Has he no sisters? have you not been bouncing About their belly-pieces? Jaq. Why should that be dangerous Or any way deserve death? is it not naturall? Bar us the Christian liberty of women, And build us up with brick, take away our free-stone. 1 Outl. Because thou art holier then he, upon my conscience He dos not envy thee: that's not his quarrell; For, look you, that might be c?pounded without praiers. Lop. Nor that thou seemst an honester man: for here We have no trading with such Tinsell-stuffe; To be an excellent thiefe, is all we aime at. Wilt thou take a spit and stride, and see if thou canst outrun us? Ped. I scorn to shift his fury, keepe your obedience; For though your governmennt admit no president, Keep your selves carefull in't. Jaq. Thou will be hang'd then. Ped. I cannot die with fewer faults upon me. 2 Out-l. Tis ten to one he wil shoot him: for the devil's in him If he hang him himselfe. Lop. He has too proud a nature: He will compell some one. Jaq. I am confident. Lop. And so are all I thinke. Ped. Be not molested, If I must die, let it not trouble you; It stirs not me: It is the end I was born for. Onely this honest office I desire ye, (If there be curtesie in men of your breed) To see me buried; not to let his fury Expose my body to the open violence Of beasts, and fowles: so far I urge humanity. Enter Roderigo, Alinda. Jaq. He shall not deny us that: we'l see ye under ground And give ye a volley of as good cups of Sacke, For that's our Discipline. Lop. He comes againe, As high in rage as ever; the boy with him. 1 Out-l. Will he compell the child? Lop. He is bent to doe it, And must have some body. Rod. If thou lov'st me doe it: Love me, or love me not, I say thou shalt doe it: Stare not, nor stagger, sirra; if ye deny me, Doe you see this Rogue? Alin. What would ye have me doe sir? Heavens goodnesse blesse me. Rod. Doe? why hang a Rascall, That would hang me. Alin. I am a boy, and weake, sir. Rod. Thou art strong enough to tie him to a Bough, And turn him off: come, thou shalt be my Jewell, And Ile allow thee horse, and all thy pleasures, And twenty gallant things: Ile teach thee armes too; Make thee mine heire. Alin. Let me inherit death first. Rod. Make me not angry, sirha. Alin. Which is the man, sir? Ile pluck up the best heart I can yet. Rod. Feare not, It is my will: That in the Pilgrimes coate there, That devill in the Saints skin. Alin. Guard me goodnesse. Rod. Dispatch him presently. Ped. I wait your worst, sir. Jaq. will the boy doe it? is the rogue so confident? So young, so deep in blood? Lop. He shakes, and trembles. Ped. Dost thou seeke more coles still to sear thy conscience, Worke sacred innocence, to be a devill? Doe it thy selfe for shame, thou best becomst it. Rod. Sirha, I scorn my finger should be filde with thee; And yet Ile have it done: this child shall strangle thee; A crying Girle, if she were here should master thee. Ali. How should I save him? how my self from violence? Ped. Leave your tongue-valour, &amp; dispatch your hate, sir; The patience of my death, shall more torment thee, (Thou painted honour, thou base man made backward) Then all my life has fear'd thee. Rod. Gag him, sirha. Jaq. The Boy looks cheerfully now: sure he will do it. Lop. He will mall him else. Alin. Are ye prepar'd to die, sir? Ped. Yes boy, and ready; prethee to thy businesse. Alin. Why are ye then so angry? so perplext, sir? Patience wins Heaven, and not the heat of passion. Why doe you rayle? Lop. The boy's a pretty Priest. Ped. I thank ye gentle child, you teach me truely. Alin. You seem to feare too. Ped. Thou seest more, then I feel, boy. Alin. You tremble sure. Ped. No sure boy, tis thy tendernesse: Prethee make haste, and let that gulph be satisfied. Alin. Are ye so willing to goe to it? Ped. Most willing: I would not borrow from his curtesie One houre of life, to gaine an age of glory. Alin. And is your reckoning straight sir? Ped. As straight as truth, boy: I cannot go more joyfully to a wedding. Alin. Then to your prayers: Ile dispatch ye presently. Now guid my tongue, thou blessednesse. Rod. A good boy. Alin. But harke ye sir, one word; and pray ye resolve me. Let me speake privately. Rod. What wouldst thou have child? Alin. Shall this man die? Rod. Why dost thou make that question? Alin. Pray ye be not angry: if he must, Ile doe it. But must he now? Rod. What else? who dare reprieve him? Alin. Pray ye thinke againe; and as your injuries Are great, and full, you suffer from this fellow, Doe not ye purpose so to suit your vengeance? Rod. I doe, and must. Alin. You cannot if he die now. Rod. Cannot? Alin. No, cannot: be not vext, you'l finde it. I have considered, and I know it certaine, Ye suffer below him: lose all your angers. Rod. Why my best boy? Alin. I love, and tender ye, I would not tell ye else. Is that revenge, To sleight your cause, and Saint your enemy, Clap the Doves wings of downy peace unto him, And let him soare to Heaven, whilst you are sighing? Is this revenge? Rod. I would have him die. Alin. Prepar'd thus? The blessing of a father never reach'd it: His contemplation now scornes ye, contemnes ye, And all the tortors ye can use. Let him die thus; And these that know and love revenge will laugh at ye: Here lies the honour of a wel-bred anger, To make his enemy shake and tremble under him; Doubt: nay, almost despaire, and then confound him. This man ye rocke asleep, and all your rages Are Requiems to his parting soule, meere Anthems. Rod. Indeed he is strongly built. Alin. You cannot shake him; And the more waight ye put on his foundation, Now as he stands, ye fixe him still the stronger; If ye love him, honour him, would heape upon him Friendships and benefits beyond example, Hope him a Star in Heaven, and there would stick him, Now take his life. Rod. I had rather take mine own, Boy. Alin. Ile ease him presently. Rod. Stay, be not hasty. Alin. Blesse my tongue still. Lop. What has the boy done to him? How dull, and still he lookes? Alin. You are a wise man. And long have buckled with the worlds extremities, A valiant man, and no doubt know both fortunes, And would ye work your Master-peece thus madly, Take the bare name of honour, that will pitty ye When the world knows ye have prey'd on a poor Pilgrim? Rod. The Boy has staggard me: what would'st thou have me? Alin. Have ye? do you not feel Sir? do's it not stir ye? Doe you aske a child? I would have ye do most bravely, Because I most affect ye: like your selfe Sir, Scorn him, and let him goe; seem to contemne him, And now ye have made him shake, seale him his pardon, When he appears a subject fit for Anger, And fit for you, his pious Armour off, His hopes no higher then your sword may reach at Then strike, and then ye know revenge; then take it. I hope I have turn'd his mind. Rod. Let the foole goe there, I scorn to let loose so base an anger May light on thee: See me no more, but quit me; And when we meet again. Ped. I'le thank ye Captaine. Exit. Alin. Why this was like your selfe: but which way goes he? Shall we ne're happy meet? Rod. I am drowsie; Boy, Goe with me, and discourse: I like thy company O Child! I love thy Tongue. Alin. I shall waite on ye. Exit. Lo. The Boy has don't: a Plaguey witty Rascall. And I shall love him terribly. Iaq. 'Twas he most certaine, For if ye marke, how earnest he was with him, And how he labour'd him. Lop. A cuning villaine, But a good Rogue; 'This Boy will make's all honest. 1. Outl. I scarce beleeve that: but I like the Boy well Come, let's to Supper; then upon our watches. Lop. This Pilgrim scap'd a joyfull one. Iaq. Let's Drink round, To the Boyes health, and then about our businesse. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Roderigo, Iaques, Loper, and three Out-Lawes. Rod. None of you know her? Iaq. Alas Sir, we never saw her: Nor ever heard of her, but from your report. Rod. No happy eye? Lop. I doe not think 'tis she, Sir, Me thinks a woman dares not. Rod. Thou speak'st poorely, What dares not woman, when she is provok'd? Or what seemes dangerous to Love, or fury? That it is she, this has confirm'd me certain, These Jewels here, a part of which I sent her, And though unwilling, yet her Father wrought her To take, and weare. Lop. A wench, and we not know it? And among us? where were our understandings? I could have ghess'd unhappily: have had some feeling In such a matter: Here are as pretty fellowes, At the discovery of such a Jigambob: A handsome wench too? sure we have lost our faculties, We have no motions: what should she doe here, Sir? Rod. That's it that troubles me: O that base Rascall! There lies the misery: how cunningly she quit him, And how she urg'd? had ye been constant to me, I ne're had suffer'd this. 1. Outl. Ye might have hang'd him: And would he had been hang'd; that's all we care for't: So our hands had not don't. Rod. She is gone again too, And what care have ye for that? gone, and contemn'd me; Master'd my will, and power, and now laughs at me. Lop. The devill that brought her hither, Sir I thinke Has carryed her back again invisible, For we ne're knew, nor heard of her departure. Iaq. No living thing came this night through our watches She went with you: Rod. Was by me till I slept, But when I wak'd, and call'd: O my dull pate here, If I had open'd this when it was given me, This Roguy Box. Enter Alphonso, and 2 Outlaw. Lop. We could but give it ye. Rod. Pilgrime? a Pox O Pilgrimes there the game goes, There's all my fortune fled; I know it, I feele it. Al. Bring me unto thy Captain: where's thy Captain? I am founder'd, melted, some fairy thing or other Has led me dauncing; the devill has haunted me Ith' likenesse of a voyce: give me thy Captaine. 2. Outl. He's here Sir, there he stands. Al. How do'st thou Captain? I have been fool'd and jaded, made a dogge bolt. My daughters runne away: I have been haunted too, I have lost my horse; I am hungry, &amp; out of my wits also. Rod. Come in; I'le tell you what I know: strange things And take your ease; I'le follow her recovery, These shall be yours the whil'st, and do ye service. Al. Let me have drinke enough: I am almost choak'd too. Rod. You shall have any thing; what think you now, Souldiers? Jaq. I think a woman, is a woman that's any thing. The next we take, we'l search a little neerer, We'l not be boyed again with a paire of breeches. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Iuletta. Iul. He's gone in here: This is Roderigo's quarter, And i'le be with him soone: I'le startle him, A little better then I have done: All this long night I have led him out o'th way, to try his patience, And made him sweare, and curse; and pray, and sweare againe, And cry for anger; I made him leave his horse too, Where he can never find him more; whistled to him, And then he would run through thick &amp; thin, to reach me, And down in this ditch; up again, and shake him And swear some certaine blessings; then into that bush Pop goes his pate, and all his face is comb'd over, And I sit laughing: a hundred tricks, I have serv'd him: And I will double em, before I leave him; I'le teach his anger to dispute with women, But all this time, I cannot meet my Mistresse, I cannot come to comfort her; that grieves me, For sure she is much afflicted: till I doe, I'le haunt thy Ghost Alphonso; I'le keep thee waking, Yes, I must get a Drum: I am villanous weary, And yet i'le trot about these villages Till I have got my will, and then have at ye. I'le make your anger drop out at your elbowes ere I leave ye. Exit. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Seberto, and Curio. Seb. 'Tis strange, in all the circuit we have ridden, We cannot crosse her: no way light upon her: Cur. I doe not think she is gone thus far, or this way, For certain if she had, we should have reach'd her Made some discovery: heard some news; we have seen nothing. Seb. Nor passe by any body that could promise anything. She is certainly disguis'd, her modesty Durst never venture else. Cur. Let her take any shape, And let me see it once, I can distinguish it. Seb. So should I think too: has not her father found her? Cur. No, i'le be hang'd then; he has no patience Unlesse she light in's teeth, to looke about him. He guesses now, and chafes and frets like Tinsell. Seb. Let him goe on, he cannot live without it. But keep her from him, heaven: where are we Curio? Cur. In a wood I think, hang me if I know else. And yet I have ridden all these Coasts, at all houres, And had and aime. Seb. I would we had a guid, Cur. And if I be not much awry Seberto, Not far off should be Rodorigo's quarter, For in this Fastwes if I be not cozen'd, He and his Out-laws live. Seb. This is the place then Enter Alinda. We appointed him to meet in. Cur. Yes, I thinke so: Seb. Would we could meet some living thing: what's that there? Cur. A Boy, I think, stay; why may not he direct us. Alin. I am hungry, and I am weary, and I cannot find him. Keep my wits heaven, I feele 'em wavering, O God my head. Seb. Boy, dost thou heare, thou stripling? Alin. Now they will teare me, torture me, now Roderigo Will hang him without mercy; ha: Cur. Come hither. A very pretty Boy: what place is this, child? And whether dost thou travell? how he stares! Some stubborn Master has abu'd the Boy, And beaten him: how he complaines! whether goest thou? Alin. I goe to Segonia Sir, to my sick Mother, I have been taken here by drunken theeves, And (O my bones;) I have been beaten Sir. Mis-us'd, &amp; rob'd: extreamly beaten Gentlemen, O God, my side! Seb. What beasts would use a Boy thus? Look up, and be of good cheer: Alin. O, I cannot. My back, my back, my back. Cur. What theeves? Alin. I know not. But they call the Captaine Roderigo. Cur. Look ye, I know we were there abouts; Seb. Do'st thou want any thing? Alin. Nothing but ease, but ease, Sir. Cur. There's some mony, And get thee to thy Mother. Alin. I thank ye Gentlemen: Seb. This was extreamely foule, to vex a Child thus. Come, let's along, we cannot loose our way now. Ex. Alin. Though ye are honest men, I feare your fingers, And glad I am got off; O how I tremble! Send me but once within his armes dear Fortune, And then come all the world: what shall I do now? 'Tis almost night again, and where to lodge me, Enter Iuletta. Or get me meat, or any thing, I know not. These wild woods, and the fancies I have in me, Will run me mad. Iul. Boy, Boy: Alin. More set to take me? Iul. Do'st thou heare Boy; thou pointer. Alin. 'Tis a Boy too, A Lacky Boy: I need not feare his feircenesse. Jul. Canst thou beat a Drum? Alin. A Drum? Iul. This thing, a drum here. Didst thou never see a Drum: Canst thou make this grumble? Alin. Iulettas face, and tongue; Is she run mad too? Here may be double craft: I have no skill in't. Iul. I'le give thee a Royall but to goe along with me. Alin. I care not for thy Royall, I have other businesse, Drum to thy selfe, and daunce to it. Iul. Sirha, Sirha. Thou scurvy Sitha; thou snotty-nos'd scab, do'st thou heare me? If I lay downe my Drum. Enter Rodorigo, and two Outlaw. Alin. Here comes more Company, I feare a plot, heaven send me fairely from it. Exit. Iul. Basto; who's here? Lop. Captain, do you need me Father? Rod. No not a foot: give me the gowne: the sword now. Iul. This is the devill theef, and if he take me, Woe be to my Gally-gaskins. Lop. Certaine Sir, She will take her patches of, and change her habit. Rod. Let her do what she please: No, no Alinda You cannot cozen me againe in a Boyes figure, Nor hide the beauty of that face in patches, But I shall know it. Iul. A Boy his face in patches? Rod. Nor shall your tongue againe bewitch mine Anger, If she be found ith' woods, send me word presently, And i'le returne; she cannot be farre gone yet, If she be not, expect me, when ye see me, Use all your service to my friend Alphonso, And have a care to your businesse: farewell, No more, farewell. Exeunt. Iul. I am heartily glad thou art gone yet. This Boy in patches, was the Boy came by me, The very same, how hastily it shifted? What a mopp'-eyed asse was I, I could not know her, This must be she, this is she, now I remember her, How loth she was to talk too, how she fear'd me? I could now pisse mine eyes out for meer anger: I'le follow her, but who shall vex her father then? One flurt at him, and then I am for the voyage, If I can crosse the Captain too: Come Tabor. Exit. ScÃ¦na quarta. Enter Iaques, and 1 Out-Law. Iaq. Are they all set? 1 Outl. All, and each quarter quiet. Iaq. Is the old man asleep? 1 Outl. An houre agoe Sir. Iaq. We must be very carefull in his absence, And very watchfull. 1 Outl. It concerns us neerely, He will not be long from us. Jaq. No, he cannot, 1 Out-l. A little heate of love, which he must wander out. Drum a far off. And then again: harke. Jaq. What? 1 Out-l. Tis not the wind sure: That's still and calme; no noyse, nor flux of waters. Jaq. I heare a Drum, I thinke. 1 Out-l. That that; It beats againe now. Jaq. Now it comes neerer: sure we are surprized, sir; Some from the Kings command: we are lost, we are dead all. 1 Out-l. Hark, hark, a charge now: my Captaine has betray'd us. And left us to this ruine, run away from us. Enter two Out-lawes. Lop. Another beates o'that side. 2 Out-l. Fly, flie, Jaques, We are taken in a toyle; snapt in a pitfall; Methinks I feele a Sword already shave me. 3 Out-l. A thousand horse and foct, a thousand pioners, If we get underground, to fetch us out againe; And every one an Axe to cut the woods downe. Lop. This is the dismalst nightâ Exit. Enter Alphonso. Alp. Where's my nag now? And what make I here to be hang'd? What devill brought me into this danger? Is there nere a hole? That I may creep in deep enough, and die quickly? Nere an old ditch to choke in? I shall be taken For their Commander now, their Generall, And have a commanding Gallows set up for me As high as a May-pole; and nasty Songs made on me, Be printed with a Pint-pot and a dagger. They are all kill'd by this time: Can I pray? Let me see that first: I have too much feare to be faithfull. Where's all my State now? I must go hunt for daughters; Daughters, and damsels of the Lake, damned daughters. A hundred Crownes for a good tod of Hay, Or a fine hollow Tree, that would containe me; I heare 'em comming: I feele the nooze about me. Enter Seberto, Curio, Outlaws, Jaques. Seb. Why do you fear, and fly? here are no Souldiers; None from the King to vex ye. 1 Outl. The Drum, the Drum, sir. Cur. I never saw such Pigeon-hearted people: What Drum? what danger? who's that that shakes behind there: Mercy upon me sir, why are ye fear'd thus? Alp. Are we all kill'd, no mercy to be hoped for? Am I not shot do you think? Seb. You are strangely frighted, Shot with a fiddle stick: who's here to shoot ye? A Drum we saw indeed, a boy was beating it, And hunting Squirrels by Moon-light. Lop. Nothing else, sir? Cur. Not any thing: no other person stirring. Alp. O that I had that boy: this is that Devill, That fairy rogue, that haunted me last night; H'as sleeves like Dragons wings. Seb. A little Foot-boy. Alp. Come, let's go in, and let me get my clothes on; If ere I stay here more to be thus martyr'dâ Did ye not meet the wench? Seb. No sure, we met her not. Alp. She has been here in boyes apparrell, Gentlemen, A gallant thing, and famous for a Gentlewoman, And all her face patcht over for discovery: A pilgrime too, and thereby hangs a circumstance, That she hath playd her master-prize, a rare one. I came too short. Cur. Such a young boy we met sir. Alp. In a gray hat. Cur. The same: his face all patcht too. Alp. Twas she, a rot run with her; she: that ranck she; Walk in, Ile tell ye all: and then we'l part again, But get some store of Wine: this fright sits here yet. Ex. Enter Juletta. Jul. What a fright I have put 'em in; what a brave hurry. If this doe bolt him, Ile be with him againe With a new part, was never play'd; Ile ferk him. As he hunts her, so ile hunt him: Ile claw him. Now will I see if I can crosse her footing: Yet still ile watch his water, he shall pay for't; And when he thinks most malice, and meanes worse, Ile make him know the Mare's the better Horse. Exit. Scena quinta. Enter Pedro, and a Gentleman. Gent. Ye are a stranger sir, and for humanity, Being come within our walls, I would shew you something. Ye have seen the Castle? Ped. Yes sir, tis a strong one, And well maintain'd. Gent. Why are you still thus sad, sir? How doe ye like the walkes? Ped. They are very pleasant; Your Town stands coole and sweet. Gent. But that I would not Affect you with more sadnesse, I could shew ye A place worth view. Ped. Showes seldome alter me sir; Pray ye speake it, and then shew it. Gen. Tis a house here Where people of all sorts, that have been visited With lunacies and follies waite their cures, Their's fancies of a thousand stamps and fashions, Like flies in severall shapes buze round about ye, And twice as many gestures; some of pitty, That it would make ye melt to see their passions: And some as light againe, that would content ye. But I see sir, your temper is too modest, Too much inclin'd to contemplation, To meet with these? Ped. You could not please me better; And I beseech you sir, doe me the honour To let me waite upon ye. Gent. Since ye are willing, To me it shall be a pleasure to conduct ye. Ped. I never had such a mind yet to see misery. Exeunt. Scena sexta. Enter two Keepers. 1 Keep. Carry mad Besse some meat, she rores like Thunder; And tie the Parson short, the Moone's ith full, H'as a thousand Pigs in's braines: Who lookes to the Prentize? Keep him from women, he thinks h'as lost his Mistris, And talke of no silke stuffes, 'twill runne him horn mad. 2 Keep. The Justice keeps such a stirre yonder with his Charges, And such a coyle with warrants, 1 K. Take away his Statutes; The divell has possest him in the likenesse Of penall Lawes: keep him from Aquavite, For if that spirit creep into his corum, He will commit us all: how is it with the Scholler? 2 K. For any thing I see, he's in his right wits. 1 K. Thou art an asse; in's right wits, goodman coxcomb? As though any man durst be in's right wits, and be here. It is as much as we dare be that keep 'em. Enter English madman. Engl. Give me some drink. 1 K. O, there's the English man. Engl. Fill me a thousand pots, and froth 'em, froth 'em. Down o' your knees, ye rogues, and pledge me roundly; One, two, three, and foure; we shall be all merry within this houre. To the great Turke. 1 K. Peace, peace, thou Heathen drunkard; These English are so Malt-mad, there's no medling with 'em; When they have a fruitfull yeere of Barly there, All the whole Island's thus. Engl. A Snuff, a snuff, a snuff. A lewd notorious snuff: giv't him againe, boy. Enter Shee-foole. Fool. God-ye-good even, Goffer. 2 K. Who let the Foole loose? 1 K. If any of the mad-men take her, she is pepper'd, They'l bounce her loynes. Foole. Will ye walke into the cole house? 1. K. She is as leacherous too as a she-ferret. 2 K. Who a vengeance looks to her? go in Kate, Ile give thee a fine Apple. Foole. Will ye busse me? And tickle me, and make me laugh? 1 K. Ile whip ye. Engl. Foole, foole, come up to me foole. Foole. Are ye peeping? Engl. Ile get thee with five fooles. Foole. O fine, O dainty. Eng. And thou shalt lie in in a horse-cloth, like a Lady Foole. And shall I have a Coach? Engl. Drawn with foure Turkeys, And they shall tread thee too. Foole. We shall have egges then; And shall I sit upon 'em? Engl. I, I, and they shall be all addle, And make an admirable Tanzey for the divell. Come, come away, I am taken with thy love foole, And will mightily be labour thee. 1 K. How the foole bridles? how she twitters at him? These Englishmen would stagger a wise-woman. If we should suffer her to have her will now, We should have all the women in Spaine as mad as she here, 2 K. They would strive who should be most fool: away with her. Enter Master, three Gentlemen, a mad Scholler, and Pedro. Foole. Pray ye stay a little: lets heare him sing, h'as a fine breast. 1 K. Here comes my Master; to the spit ye whore, And stir no more abroad, but tend your businesse; Your shall have no more sops ith' pan else, nor no porrige: Besides, Ile whip your breech. Foole. Ile goe in presently. 1 Gent. Ile assure ye sir, the Cardinal's angry with ye For keeping this young man. Mast. I am heartily sorry. If ye allow him sound, pray ye take him with ye. 1 Gent. This is the place, and now observe their humors: 2 Gent. We can find nothing in him light, nor tainted; No startings, nor no rubs, in all his answers, In all his Letters nothing but discretion, Learning, and handsome stile. Mast. Be not deceived sir, Marke but his looke. 1 Gent. His griefe, and his imprisonment May stamp that there. Mast. Pray talke with him again then. 2 Gent. That will be needlesse, we have tride him long enough, And if he had a taint we should have met with't. Yet to discharge your careâ Ped. A sober youth: Pity so heavy a crosse should light upon him. 2 Gent. You finde no sicknesse? Schol. None sir, I thank Heaven, Nor nothing that diverts my understanding. 1 Gent. Doe you sleep a nights? Schol. As sound, and sweet, as any man: 2 Gent. Have ye no fearfull dreams? Schol. Sometimes, as all have That go to bed with raw and windy stomacks; Else, I am all one piece. 1 Gent. Is there no unkindnesse You have conceiv'd from any friend or parent? Or scorne from what ye lov'd? Schol. No, truely sir: I never yet was master of a faith So poore, and weake, to doubt my friend or kindred, And what love is, unlesse it lie in learning I thinke I am ignorant. 1 Gent. This man is perfect, A civiller discourser I nere talk'd with. Mast. You'l finde it otherwise. 2 Gent. I must tell ye true sir, I thinke ye keep him here to teach him madnesse. Here's his discharge from my Lord Cardinall; And come sir, goe with us. Schol. I am bound unto ye, And farewell Master. Mast. Farewell Stephano, Alas poore man. 1 Gent. What flaws, and whirles of weather, Or rather storms have been aloft these three daies; How darke, and hot, and full of mutiny! And still grows lowder. Mast. It has been stubborn weather. 2 Gent. Strange work at Sea, I fear me there's old tumbling. 1 Gent. Blesse my old unkles Barke, I have a venture. 2 Gent. And I more then I would wish to lose. Scho. Doe you feare? 2 Gent. Ha! how he lookes? Mast. Nay, marke him better Gentlemen. 2 Gent. Mercy upon me: how his eyes are altered? Mast. Now tell me how ye like him: whether now He be that perfect man ye credited? Scho. Doe's the Sea stagger ye? Mast. Now ye have hit the nick. Scho. Doe ye feare the billowes? 1 Gent. What ailes him? who has stir'd him? Scho. Be not shaken, Nor let the singing of the storm shoot through ye, Let it blow on, blow on: let the clouds wrastle, And let the vapours of the earth turn mutinous, The Sea in hideous mountaines rise and tumble Upon a Dolphins back, Ile make all tremble, For I am Neptune. Mast. Now what think ye of him? 2 Gent. Alas poore man. Scho. Your Barke shall plough through all, And not a Surge so saucy to disturbe her. Ile see her safe, my power shall saile before her. Down ye angry waters all, Ye loud whistling whirlwinds fall; Down ye proud Waves, ye stormes cease; I command ye, be at peace. Fright not with your churlish Notes, Nor bruise the Keele of Bark, that flotes: No devouring Fish come nigh, Nor Monster in my Empery, Once shew his head, or terror bring; But let the weary Saylor sing: Amphitrite with white armes Srike my Lute, Ile sing Charmes. Mast. He must have Musicke now: I must observe him. His fit will grow to full else. Musick, Song. 2 Gent. I must pitty him. Mast. Now he will in himselfe most quietly, And clean forget all, as he had done nothing. 1 Gent. We are sorry, sir: and we have seen a wonder; From this houre we'l believe, and so we'l leave ye. Exit. Ped. This was a strange fit. Mast. Did ye marke him sir? Ped. He might have cozen'd me with his behaviour. Mast. Many have sworn him right, and I have thought so: Yet on a sudden, from some word, or other, When no man could expect a fit, he has flown out: I dare not give him will. Enter Alinda. Ped. Pray Heaven recover him. Alin. Must I come in too? Mast. No, my pretty Lad; Keep in thy chamber Boy: 'shalt have thy supper. Ped. I pray ye what is he sir? Mast. A strange boy, that last night Was found i'th' Town, a little craz'd, distracted, And so sent hither. Ped. How the pretty knave looks, And playes, and peepes upon me! sure such eyes I have seen, and lov'd: what fair hands? certainlyâ Mast. Good sir, you'l make him worse. Ped. I pray believe not. Alas, why should I hurt him? how he smiles? The very shape, and sweetnesse of Alinda: Let me look once againe: were it in such clothes As when I saw her last; this must be she. How tenderly it stroakes me? Mast. Pray ye be mild sir; I must attend elsewhere. Exit. Ped. Pray ye be secure sir, What would ye say? how my heart beates and trembles? He holds me hard by th'hand; O my life, her flesh too! I know not what to think: her teares, her true ones; Pure orient teares: Hark, doe you know me little one? Alin. O Pedro Pedro! Ped. O my soule! Gent. What fit's this? The Pilgrimes off the hooks too. Alin. Let me hold thee, And now come all the world, and all that hate me. Ped. Be wise, and not discovered: O how I love ye! How doe ye now? Alin. I have been miserable; But your most vertuous eyes have cur'd me, Pedro: Pray ye thinke it no immodesty, I kisse ye, My head's wild still. Ped. Be not so full of passion, Nor do not hang so greedily upon me; Twill be ill taken. Alin. Are ye weary of me? I will hang here eternally, kisse ever, And weep away for joy. Enter Master. Mast. I told ye sir, What ye would doe: for shame doe not afflict him; You have drawn his fit upon him fearfully: Either depart, and presently; Ile force ye else. Who waits within? Enter two Keepers to fetch 'em off. Ped. Alas good sir. This is the way never to hope recovery. Stay but one minute more, Ile complaine to the Governour. Bring in the boy: doe you see how he swels, and teares himselfe? Is this your cure? Be gon; if the boy miscarry Let me nere find you more, for ile so hamper yeâ Gent. You were too blame: too rash. Ped. Farewell for ever. Exeunt.</field>

You are now within a mile oth' Towne sir: if my businesse Would give me leave, I would turne and waite upon ye; But for such Gentlemen as you enquire of, Certaine, I saw none such: But for the boy ye spoke of, I will not say tis he, but such a one; Just of that height. Alph. In such clothes? Gent. I much mistake else, Was sent in th'other night, a little maddish, And where such people waite their cures. Alp. I understand ye. Gent. There you may quickly know. Alp. I thanke ye sir. Jul. So doe I to: and if there be such a place, I aske no more; but you shall heare more of me. She may be there, and you may play the tyrant; Ile see what I can doe: I am almost foundred In following him; and yet Ile never leave him, Ile crawle of all foure first; my cause is meritorious, And come what can come. Gent. All you have told me is certaine; Complexion, and all else. Alph. It may be she then; And ile so fumble her: Is she growne mad now? Is her blood set so high? ile have her madded, Ile have her worm'd. Jul. Marke but the end, old Master, If thou beest not sicke oth' Bots within these five hours, And kickst and roar'st; Ile make ye fart fire, Signior, Enter Alinda, as a foole. Gent.

O now I am lost, lost, lost, Lord, how I tremble! My father, arm'd in all his hates and angers; This is more misery then I have scap'd yet. Alp. Foole, foole. Alin. He knows me not; will ye give me two-pence? And gaffer, here's a Crow-flower, and a Dazie; I have some pie in my pocket too. Alp. This is an arrant foole, An ignorant thing. Alin. Believe so, and I am happy. Alp. Dost thou dwell in Sigonia, foole? Alin. No no, I dwell in Heaven. And I have a fine little house, made of Marmalad. And I am a lone woman, and I spin for Saint Peter; I have a hundred little children, and they sing Psalmes with me. Alp. Tis pity this pretty thing should want understanding. But why doe I stand talking with a coxcombe? If I doe finde her, if I light upon her, Ile say no more. Is this the way to th'Town, foole? Alin. You must goe over the top of that high steeple, Gaffer. Alp. A plague o' your fooles face. Jul. No, take her counsell. Alin. And then you shall come to a River twenty mile over, And twenty mile &amp; ten: and then you must pray, Gaffer; And still you must pray, and pray. Alp. Pray Heaven deliver me From such an asse, as thou art. Alin. Amen, sweet Gaffer. And fling a sop of Suger-cake into it; And then you must leap in naked. Jul. Would he would believe her. Alin. And sink seven daies together; can ye sinck gaffer? Alp. Yes coxcombe, yes; prethee farewell: a pox on thee. A plague o' that foole too, that set me upon thee. Alin. And then Ile bring you a sup of Milke shal sarve ye: I am going to get Apples. Alp. Go to th'devill: Was ever man tormented with a puppy thus? Thou tell me news? thou be a guide? Alin. And then Nunkleâ Alp. Prethee keepe on thy way (good Naunt) I could rayle now These ten houres at mine owne improvidence: Get Apples, and be choak'd: farewell. Exit. Alin. Farewell Nuncle. Jul. I rejoyce in any thing that vexes him; And I shall love this foole extreamly for't: Could I but see my Mistris now, to tell her How I have truely, honestly wrought for her, How I have worne my selfe away, to serve her. Foole, there's a Royall for the sport thou mad'st me, In crossing that old foole, that parted from thee. Alin. Thou art honest sure; but yet thou must not see me: I thanke ye little Gentleman: Heaven blesse ye And ile pray for ye too: pray ye keep this Nutmeg, Twas sent me from the Lady of the Mountaine. A golden Lady. Jul. How prettily it prattles. Alin. Tis very good to rub your understanding: And so good night: the Moone's up. Jul. Pretty innocent. Alin. Now fortune, if thou dar'st do good, protect me. Exit. Jul. Ile follow him to yond Towne: he shall not scape me: Stay, I must counterfeit a Letter by the way first, And one that must carry some credit with it: I am wide else, And all this to no purpose that I ayme at. A Letter must be had, and neatly handled: And then if Goodwife fortune doe not faile me, Have at his skirts: I shall worse anger him Then ever I have done, and worse torment him. It do's me good to thinke how I shall conjure him. And crucifie his crabbednesse: he's my Master, But that's all one: Ile lay that on the left hand. He would now persecute my harmlesse Mistris, A fault without forgivenesse, as I take it; And under that bold banner flies my vengeance, A meritorious war, and so Ile make it. I'th' name of Innocence, what's this the foole gave me? She said twas good to rub my understanding. What strange concealment? Bread or Cheese, or a Chesnut? Ha! tis a Ring: a pretty Ring, a right one: A ring I know too! the very same Ring: O admirable Blockhead! O base eyes! A Ring my Mistris tooke from me, and wore it; I know it by the Posie: Prick me, and heale me. None could deliver this, but she her selfe too: Am I twice sand-blind? twice so neer the blessing I would arive at? and block-like never know it? I am veng'ance angry, but that shal light on thee, And heavily, and quickly, I pronounce it: There are so many crosse waies, there's no following her: And yet I must not now: I hope she is right still, For all her outward shew, for sure she knew me; And in that hope, some few houres Ile forget her. Exit. Scena secunda. Enter Roderigo. Rod. She is not to be recovered, which I vex at; And he beyond my veng'ance, which torments me: O! I am fool'd and sleighted, made a Rascall; My hopes are flatterd, as my present fortunes: Why should I wander thus and play the coxcomes? Tire out my peace and pleasure for a Girle? A Girle that scorns me too? a thing that hates me? And considered at the best, is but a short breakfast For a hot appetite: why should I walke, and walke thus, And fret my selfe, and travell like a Carrier, And peep, and watch? want Meat, and Wine, to cherish me, When thousand women may be had, ten thousand, And thank me too, and I sit still: well, trim Beauty And Chastity, and all that seem to ruin me, Let me not take ye; let me not come neer ye, For Ile so trim ye: Ile so bussell with ye; Tis not the name of Virgin shall redeem ye, Ile change that property: nor teares, nor angers: I beare a hate about me scorns those follies. To finde this villaine too, for there's my main prize; And if he snap me then. Enter Alinda. Alin. Is not that Pedro? Tis he, tis he: O! Rod. What art thou? Alin. Ha? now, now, now, O now most miserable. Rod. What a' devill art thou? Alin. No end of my mis-fortunes, Heaven? Rod. What Anticke? Speake Puppet, speake. Alin. That habit to betray me? Ye holy Saints, can ye see this? Rod. It danceth: The devill in a fooles Coat, is he turn'd Innocent? What mops, and mowes it makes: heigh, how it frisketh, Is't it not a Faiery? or some small hobgoblin? It has a mortall face, and I have a great mind to it, But if it should prove the devill then. Alin. Come hither. Rod. I think 'twill ravish me, It is a handsome thing, but horribly Sun-burnt, What's that it points at? Alin. Do'st thou see that Starre there, That, just above the Sunne; Prethe goe thither, and light me this Tobacco, And stop it with the hornes o'th' Moone. Rod. The thing's mad, Abhominably mad, her braines are butter'd, Goe sleep, foole, sleep. Alin. Thou canst not sleep so sweetly: For so I can say my Prayers, and then slumber. I am not proud, nor full of wine, This little Flowre will make me fine: Cruell in heart, for I shall crie, Jf J see a Sparrow dye: I am not watchfull to doe ill, Nor glorious to pursue it still: Nor pittilesse to those that weepe; Such as are, bid them goe sleep. Doe, doe, do, and see if they can. Rod. It said true, I feele it sinke into me forcibly. Sure 'tis a kind of Sibill, some mad Prophet. I feel my wildnesse bound, and fetter'd in me. Alin. Give me your hand, and i'le tell you what's your fortune. Rod. Here: prethee speake. Alin. Fie, fie, fie, fie, fie. Wash your hands, and pare your Nailes, and look finely You shall never kisse the Kings daughter else. Rod. I wash 'em daily. Alin. But still you fowle 'em faster. Rod. This goes neerer. Alin. You'll have two wives. Rod. Two wives? Alin. I two fine gentle-women. Make much of 'em: for they'l stick close to you Sir. And these two, in two dayes. Rod. That's a fine Riddle. Alin. To day you shall wed sorrow, And repentance will come to morrow. Rod. Sure she's inspired. Alin. I'le sing ye a fine Song Sir. He called down his merry men all By one, by two, by three, William would faine have been the first, But now the last is be. Rod. This the meer Chronicle of my mis-haps. Alin. I'le bid you good ev'n: for my Boat staies for me yonder, And I must Sup with the Moone to night in the Mediterraneum. Exit. Rod. When fools, and mad-folks shall be tutors to me, And feele my sores, yet I unsensible; Sure it was set by Providence upon me To steer my heart right: I am wondrous weary. My thoughts too, which adde more burthen to me: I have been ill, and (which is worse) pursu'd it, And still runne on: I must thinke better, nobler, And be another thing, or not at all. (Enter foure Pesants. Still I grow heavier, heavier heaven defend me: I'le lye down, and take rest: and goodnes guard me. Pes. 1. We have scap'd to day well: certain, if the Out-laws Had known we had been stirring, we had paid for't, 2. Plague on 'em, they have rob'd me thrice, 3. And me five times: Beside they made my daughter one of us too An arrant Drum: O, they are the lewdest Rascals, The Captaine such a damn'd peece of iniquitie: But we are farre enough of on 'em, that's the best on't, They cannot heare. 4. They'le come to me familiarly And eat up all I have: drinke up my wine too, And if ther be a Servant that content 'em, Let her keele hold, they'll give her Stowage enough: We have no Children now, but Theeves, and Outlawes. The very Brats in their Mothers bellies have their qualities. They'll steale into the world. 1. Would we had some of 'em here, 2. I, O' that condition we could Master 'em, They are sturdy knaves. 3. A devill take their sturdinesse, We can neither keep our wives from 'em, nor our States, We pay the Rent, and they possesse the benefit. 1. What's this lies here? is it drunk, or sober? It sleeps, and soundly too. 2. 'Tis an old woman That keepes sheepe here abouts: it turns, and stretches. 4. Do's she keep sheep with a sword? 3. It has a Beard too. 1. Peace, peace: It is the devill Roderigo, Peace of all hands, and looke. 2. 'Tis he 3. Speake softly, 4. Now we may fit him. 3. Stay, stay: let's be provident. 1. Kill him, and wake him then. 4. Let me come to him, Ev'n one blow at his pate, if ere he wake more. 3. So, so, so, lay that by. 2. I must needs kill him. It stands with my reputation 3. Stand off, I say: And let us some way make him sure; then torture him. To kill him presently, has no pleasure in't. Has been tormented to us, at least this twelve moneth. Rod. Oh me! All. He comes: he comes. 4. Has he no Guns about him? 3. Softly again: no, no: take that hand easily, And tye it fast there: that to th'other bough there. Fast, fast, and easie least he wake. 2. Have we got ye? This was a benefit we never aym'd at. 3. Out with your knives, and let's carve this Cocktheefe, Daintily carve him. 1. I would he had been used thus Ten year agoe; we might have thought we had children. 3. O, that Sir Nicholas now our Priest were here. What a sweet Homily would he say over him, For ringing all in with his wife in the Bell-frey? He would stand up stiffe girt: Now pounce him lightly, And as he rores, and rages, let's goe deeper: Come neere: you are dym ey'd: on with your spectales. Rod. O, what torments me thus? what slaves, what villaines? O spare me, doe not murther me. 3. We'll but tickle ye, You have tickled us at all points. 4. Where are his Emblemes? Enter Pedro Rod. As ye are men, and Christians 2. Yes we hear ye, And you shall here of us too. Rod. Oh no mercy. Ped. What noyse is this? what rore? I cannot find her, She is got free again: but where, or which way? Rod. O' villains, beasts. Pedro. Murdring a man, ye rascals? Ye inhumane slaves, off, off, and leave this cruelty, Or as I am a Gentleman: do ye brave me? Then have among ye all, ye slaves, ye cowards. Take up that sword, and stand: stay ye base rascals, Ye cut-throate rogues. All. Away, away. Exeunt Pes. Ped. Ye dog-whelps: Rod. O' I am now more wretched far, then ever. Ped. A violence to that habit? ha? Roderigo, What makes he here, thus lad? is it repentance, Or only a fair shew to guid his mischiefes? Rod. This benefit has made me shame to see him, To know him, blush? Ped. You are not much hurt? Rod. No Sir; All I can call a hurt, sticks in my conscience, That pricks, and tortuers me. Ped. Have ye considerd The nature of these men, and how they us'd ye? Was it fair play? did it appear to you handsom? Rod. I dare not speak: or if I do, tis nothing Can bring me off, or justifie me. Ped. Was it noble To be o're-layd with odds, and violence? Manly, or brave in these thus to oppresse ye? Do you blush at this, in such as are meer rudenes, That have stopt soules, that never knew things gentle? And dare you glorifie worse in your self sir? Ye us'd me with much honour, and I thank ye, In this I have requited some: ye know me: Come turne not back, ye must, and ye shall know me; Had I bin over seasond with base anger, And suited all occasions to my mischiefes, Bore no respect to Honesty, Religion, No faith, no common tie of man, humanity, Had I had in me, but given reines, and licence To a tempestuous will, as wild as winter, This day, know Roderigo, I had set As small a prince upon thy life, and fortunes, As thou didst lately on mine innocence; But I reserve thee to a nobler service. Rod. I thank ye, and i'le studdy more to honour ye: You have the nobler soule, I must confesse it, And are the greater master of your goodnes. Though it be impossible I should now recover, And my rude will grow handsome in an instant, Yet touching but the purenes of your mettle, Something shall shew like gold, at least shall glister, That men may hope, although the mine be rugged, Stony, and hard to work: yet time, and honour Shall find and bring forth that, that's rich and worthy. Ped. I'le trie that: and to 'th purpose: ye told me sir In noble emulation, so I take it; I'le put your hatred far off, and forget it, You had a faire desire to try my valour: You seemd to court me to it; you have found a time, A weapon in your hand, an equall enemy, That, as he puts this off, puts of all injuries, And only now for honors sake defies ye: Now, as you are a man, I know you are valiant, As you are gentle bred, a souldier fashioned. Rod. His vertue startles me. I dare fight Pedro. Ped. And as you have a Mistris that you honor, Mark me, a Mistris. Rod. Ha? Ped. A handsome Mistris, As you dare hold your self deserving of her. Rod. Deserving? what a word was that to fire me? Ped. I could compell ye now without this circumstance, But i'le deale free, and fairely, like a Gentleman: As ye are worthy of the name ye carry, A daring man. Rod. O that I durst not suffer: For all I dare do now, implies but pennance. Ped. Now do me noble right. Rod. I'le satisfy ye: But not by th'word: pray ye hear me, and allow me; I have bin rude: but shall I be a monster, And teach my sword to hurt that that preserved me? Though I be rough by nature, shall my name Inherit that eternall staine of barbarous? Give me an enemy, a thing that hates ye, That never heard of yet, nor felt your goodnes, That is one main antipathy to sweetnes; And set me on, you cannot hold me coward: If I have ever err'd, 'th as in hazard: The temper of my sword starts at your vertue, And will flie off, nay it will weep to light ye; Things excellently mingled, and of pure nature, Hold sacred love, and peace with one another. See how it turnes. Ped. This is a strange conversion: And can ye faile your Mistris? can ye grow cold In such a case? Rod. Those heats that they adde to us, (O noble Pedro) let us feele 'em rightly, And rightly but consider how they move us. Ped. Is not their honour ours? Rod. If they be vertuous; And then the sword ads nothing to their lustre, But rather cals in question what's not doubted: If they be not: the best swords, and best valours Can never fight 'em up to fame again: No, not a Christian war, and that's held pious. Ped. How bravely now he is tempered? I must fight, And rather make it honorable, then angry, I would not taske those sins to me committed. Rod. You cannot sir: you have cast those by; decarded 'em, And in a noble mind, so low and loosely To look back, and collect such lumps, and lick 'em Into new horrid formes agen. Ped. Still braver. Rod. To fight, because I dare, were worse, and weaker Then if I had a woman in my cause, sir, And more proclaim'd me foole; yet I must confesse I have bin covetous of all occasions, And this I have taken upon trust, for noble, The more shame mine; devise a way to fight thus, That like the wounded aire no blood may issue, Nor where this sword shall enter, no lost spirit, And set me on: I would not scar that body, That vertuous, valiant body, nor deface it To make the Kingdom mine: if one must bleed, Let me be both the sacrifice, and altar, And you the Priest: I have deserv'd to suffer. Ped. The noble Roderigo, now I call ye, And thus my love shall ever count, and hold ye, I am your servant sir: and now this habit, Devotion, not distrust shall put upon me, I'le wait upon your fortunes, that's my way now, And where you grieve, or joy, i'le be a partner. Ped. I thank ye sir, I shall be too proud of ye, O I could tell ye strange things. Rod. I ghesse at 'em, And I could curse my self, I made 'em stranger; Yet my mind sayes, you are not far from happines. Ped. It shall be welcome; come, lets keep us thus still, And be as we appear: Heavens hand may blesse us. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Alphonso, Master and Keepers. Mast. Yes sir, here be such people: but how pleasing, They will appear to you. Alp. Pray let me see'm, I come to that end: pray let me see 'em all. Mast. They will confound ye sir, like bels rung backward They are nothing but confusion, and meer noyses. Alp. May be I love a noyse: but hark ye sir, Have ye no boyes, handsome yong boyes? Mast. Yes one sir, A very handsome boy. Alp. Long here? Mast. But two dayes; A little crazed: but much hope of recovery. Alp. I that boy, let me see: may be I know him: That boy, I say: this is the boy he told me of, And it must needs be she: that boy I beseech ye sir, That boy I come to see. Mast. And ye shall see him: Or any els, but pray be not too violent. Alp. I know what to do I warrant ye: I am for all fancies: I can talk to 'em, and dispute. 1 Keep. As madly: For they be very madde sir. Alp. Let 'em be horne mad. 1. Keep. We have few Citizens: they have bedlames of their own sir, And are mad at their own charges. Alp. Who lies here? Mast.

What's he? what's he? Mast. A parson sir, a parson, That run madde for tythe Goslings. Alp. Green sawce cure him. Pars.

Sue me, I'le drink up all, bownce I say once more, O, have I split your mizen? blow, blow thou West wind, Blow till thou rive, and make the Sea run roaring.

Drink, drink, tis day light; Drink, didle, didle, didle, drink, Parson, proud Parson; A pigs tayle in thy teeth, and I defie thee. Par. Give me some porridge, or i'le damne thee English. Alp. How comes this English madde man here? Mast. Alas thats no question: They are mad every where sir; Their fits are coole now: let 'em rest. Enter Keepers and shee-foole. Alp. Madde Gallants: Most admirable mad: I love their faces. 1. K. Ye stinking whore: who knew of this? who lookd to him? Pox take him, he was sleepy when I left him, 2. K.

But wher's the boy? She-f. The boy is gone a maying, Hee'l bring me home a Cuckowes nest; do ye hear Master I put my cloths off, and I dizend him, And pind a plumb in's forehead, and a feather, And buss'd him twice, and bid him go seek his fortune: He gave me this fine money, and fine wine too, And bid me sop: and gave me these trim cloths too, And put 'em on. Alp. Is this the boy you would shew? She-f. I'le give you two pence Master. Alp. Am I foold of all sidies? I met a foole i'th woods, they said she dwelt here, In a long pied coat. Mast. That was the very boy, sir. She-f. I, I, I, I gave him leave to play forsooth, Hee'l come again to morrow, and bring pescods. Mast. I'le bring your bones. Alp. Pox o' your fooles, and bedlams, Plague o' your owls and apes. Mast. Pray ye sir, be tamer, We cannot help this presently: but we shal know; I'le recompence your cares too. Alp. Know me a pudding.

You have hit the cause I come for: ther's a letter Pray ye peruse it well: I shall be wi' ye; And sodainly, I fear not: finley, daintely, I shall so feed your fierce vexation, And raise your worships stormes: J shall so niggle ye, And juggle ye, and fiddle ye, and firck ye: I'le make ye curse the houre yet vext a woman; I'le make ye shake, when our sex, are but sounded: For the Lords sake, we shall have him at; I long to see it As much as for my wedding night: I gape after it. Mast. This Letter sayes the Gentleman is lunatique I half suspected it. Iul. Tis very true sir, And such prancks he has plaid. Mast. He's some great man, The Duke commands me with such care to look to him, And if he grow too violent, to correct him, To use the speediest meanes for his recovery, And those he must finde sharpe. Iul. The better for him: Mast. How got ye him hither? Iul. With a train, I told him: He's in love with a boy, there lies his mellancholly. Mast. Hither he came to seek one. Iul. Yes, J sent him, Now had we dealt by force, we had never brought him. Mast. Here was a boy. Iul. He saw him not? Mast. He was gon first. Iul. It is the better; looke you to your charge well: Ile see him lodged, for so the duke commanded me He will be very rough. Mast. We are usd to that sir, And we as rough as he, if he give occasion. Iul. You will find him gainfull, but be sure ye curb him, And get him if ye can fairely to his lodging, Enter Alphonso I am afraid ye will not. Mast. We must sweat then. Alp.

What dost thou talk to me of Dukes, and Devils, Why do the people gape so? Mast. Do not anger 'em, But go in quietly, and slip in softly They will so tew ye, els, I am commanded sir. Alp. Why, prethee why? Mast. Ye are dog-mad: you perceive it not Very far madde: and whips will scant recover ye. Alp. Ha: whips? Mast.

Do you see this sir? Irons brought in Down with that devill in ye. Alp. Indeed I am angry, But ile containe my selfe: O I could burst now, And teare my selfe, but these rogues will torment me, Madde in mine old dayes? make mine owne afflictions? Mast. What doe you mutter sir? Alph. Nothing, sir, nothing; I will goe in, and quietly, most civilly: And good sir, let none of your tormentors come about me, You have a gentle face; they look like Dragons. Mast. Be civill and be safe: come, for these two daies Ye must eate nothing neither: twill ease your fits sir. Alph. Twill starve me sir; but I must beare it joyfully. I may sleepe? Mast. Yes, a little: go in with these men. Alph. O miserable me! Exit. Mast. Ile follow presently. You see tis done sir. Jul. Ye have done it handsomely, And ile inform the Duke so: Pray ye attend him, Let him want nothing, but his will. Mast. He shall not, And if he be rebelliousâ Jul. Never spare him: H'as flesh, and hide enough, he loves a whipping. Mast. My service to his Grace. Exit. Jul. I shall commend it. So, thou art fast: I must goe get some fresh roome To laugh, and caper in: O how it tickles me! O how it tumbles me with joy! thy mouths stopt: Now if I can doe my Mistris good, I am Sainted.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Seberto, Curio. Seb. Now, o' my conscience, we have lost him utterly, He's not gon home: we heard from thence this morning, And since our parting last at Rodorigo's, You know what ground we have travel'd. Cur. He's asleep sure: For if he had been awake. we should have met with him: 'Faith let's turn back, we have but a fruitlesse journey; And to hope further of Alindas recovery, (For sure she'l rather perish then returne) Is but to seeke a Moth i'th Sunne. Seb. We'l on sure; Something we'l know, some cause of all this fooling, Make some discovery. Cur. Which way shall we cast then, For all the Champion Country, and the villages, And all those sides? Seb. We'l crosse these woods awhile then: Here if we faile, we'l gallop to Segonia And if we light of no news there, heare nothing; We'l even turn fairly home, and coast the other side. Cur. He may be sicke, or faln into some danger; He has no guide, nor no man to attend him. Seb. He's well enough, he has a travel'd body, And though he be old, he's tough, and will endure well; But he is so violent to finde her out, That his anger leads him a thousand wild goose chases: Ile warrant he is well. Cur. Shall we part company? Seb. By no means, no: that were a sullen businesse: No pleasure in our journey: Come, let's crosse here first, And where we finde the paths, let them direct us. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Juletta, Alinda. Jul. Why are you still so fearfull of me, Lady? So doubtfull of my faith, and honest service? To hide your selfe from me, to fly my company? Am I not yours? all yours? by this light you shake still; Do ye suspect me false? did I ever faile ye? Doe you think I am corrupted? base? and treacherous? Lord, how ye look! Is not my life tyde to ye? And all the power I have to serve, and honour ye? Still do ye doubt? still am I terrible? I will not trouble ye: good Heaven preserve ye, And send ye what ye wish: I will not see ye, Nor once remember I had such a Mistris. I will not speak of ye, nor name Alinda, For feare you should suspect I would betray ye: Goodnesse and peace conduct ye. Alin. Prethee pardon me, I know thou art truly faithfull: and thou art welcome, A welcome partner to my miseries; Thou knowst I love thee too. Jul. I have thought so, Lady. Alin. Alas, my feares have so distracted me I durst not trust my selfe. Jul. Come, pray ye think better, And cast those by: at least consider, Lady, How to prevent 'em: pray ye put off this fooles coate; Though it have kept ye secret for a season, Tis known now, and will betray ye; your arch enemy Roderigo is abroad: many are looking for ye. Alin. I know it: and those many I have cozen'd: Jul. You cannot still thus. Alin. I have no meanes to shift it. Jul. I have: and shift you too. I lay last night At a poore widows house here in the Thicket, Whether I will conduct ye, and new shape ye, My selfe too to attend ye. Alin. What meanes hast thou? For mine are gone. Jul. Feare not, enough to serve ye; I came not out so empty. Alin. Prethee tell me, (For thou hast stroke a kind of comfort through me.) When saw'st thou Roderigo? Jul. Even this morning, And in these woods: take heed, h'as got a new shape. Alin. The habit of a Pilgrime? yes, I know it, And I hope shall prevent it; was he alone? Jul. No Madam, and which made me wonder mightily, He was in company with that handsome Pilgrime, That sad sweet man. Alin. That I forgot to give to? Jul. The same, the very same, that you so pittied, A man as fit to suit his villanies. Alin. And did they walke together? Jul. Wondrous civilly. Alin. Talke, and discourse? Jul. I thinke so, for I see 'em Make many stands, and then embrace each other. Alin. The Pilgrime is betraid, a Judas dwels with him, A Simon, that will seem a Saint to choake him. Canst thou but shew me this? Iul. Lord how she trembles! Not thus, for all the world, ye are undone then; But let's retire, and alter, then we'l walke free; And then ile shew ye any thing. Alin. Come, good wench, And speedily: for I have strang faiths working, As strange feares too, ile tell thee all my life then. Jul. Come quick, ile conduct ye, and still serve ye, And doe not feare; hang feare, it spoiles all projects. This way; Ile be your guide. Exeunt. Scena tertia. Enter Governour, Verdugo, Citizens. Gov. Use all your sports, All your solemnities; tis the Kings day to morrow. His birth-day, birth day, and his marriage, a glad day, A day we ought to honour, all. 1 Cit. We will sir, And make Segonia ring with our rejoycings. Gov. Be sumptuous, but not riotous; be bounteous, But not in drunken Bacchanals: free to all strangers, Easie, and sweet in all your entertainments, For tis a Royall day admits no rudenesse. 2 Cit. Your Lordship will do us the honour to be here your selfe, And grace the day? Gov. Tis a maine part of my service. 3 Cit. I hope your honour has taken into your consideration The miseries we have suffered by these Out-laws, The losses, howrly feares; the rude abuses Strangers that travell to us are daily loaden with Our daughters, and our wives complaints. Gov. I am sorry for't, And have Commission from the King to ease it: You shall not be long vext. 1 Cit. Had we not wals, sir, And those continually man'd too with our watches, We should not have a bit of meat to feed us. And yet they are our friends, and we must think so, And entertaine 'em so sometimes, and feast 'em, And send 'em loden home too, we are lost else. 2 Cit. They'l come to Church amongst us, as we hope Christians, When all their zeale is but to steale the Chalices; At this good time now, if your Lordship were not here, To awe their violence with your authority, They would play such gambals. Gov. Are they grown so heady? 2 Cit. They would drink up all our Wine, pisse out our Bonfires; Then, like the drunken Centaures, have at the fairest, Nay, have at all: fourscore and ten's a Goddesse, Whilst we, like fooles, stand shaking in our cellars. Gov. Are they so fierce upon so little sufferance? Ile give 'em such a purge, and suddenly. Verdugo, after this solemnity is over Call on me for a charge of men, of good men, To see what house these knaves keep: of good souldiers, As sturdy as themselves: that dare dispute with 'em, Dare walk the woods as well as they, as fearlesse, But with a better faith belabour 'em; Ile know what claim they have to their possession. Tis pity of their Captaine Roderigo, A wel-bred Gentleman, and a good souldier, And one, his Majesty has some little reason To thank, for sundry services, and faire ones; That long neglect bred this, I am sorry for him. Ver. The hope of his estate keeps backe his pardon, There's divers waspes, that buz about that honey-box, And long to lick themselves full. Gov. True Verdugo, Would he had but the patience to discerne it, And policy to wipe their lips. Verd. To fetch him in sir, By violence, he being now no in infant, Will aske some bloody crowns. I know his people. Are of his owne choice men, that will not totter, Nor blench much at a Bullet; I know his order, And though he have no multitude, h'as manhood; The elder-twin to that too, staid experience. But if he must be forced, sir,â Gov. There's no remedy, Unlesse he come himselfe. Ver. That will be doubtfull. Did you never hear yet of the Noble Pedro? Gov. I cannot by no means; I think he's dead sure; The Court bewailes much his untimely losse: The King himselfe laments him. Uerd. He was sunke; And if he be dead, he died happily, He buried all he had in the Kings service, And lost himselfe. Gov. Well: if he be alive, Captaine, (As hope still speaks the best) I know the Kings mind So inwardly and full, he will be happy. Come, to this preparation; when that's done, The Outlaws expedition is begun. Cit. We'l contribute all to that, and help our selves too. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Quarta. Enter Rodorigo, Pedro. Rod. How sweet these solitary places are? how wantonly The wind blowes through the leafes, leases, and courts, and playes with 'em? Will ye sit down, and sleep? the heat invites ye. Harke how yond purling stream dances, and murmurs, The Birds sing softly too: pray take some rest, sir. I would faine wooe his fancie to a peace, It labours high and hastily upon him; Pray ye sit, and Ile sit by. Ped. I cannot sleep friend, I have those watches here admit no slumbers. Saw ye none yet? Rod. No creature. Ped. What strange Musicke Was that we heard afar off? Rod. I cannot guesse; Twas loud, and shrill: sometimes it shew'd hard by us, And by and by the sound fled as the wind does; Here's no inhabitants. Ped. It much delighted me. Rod. They talke of Faeries, and such demi-devils, This is as fine a place to dance their gambols.â Ped. Me thought I heard a voyce. Musick &amp; Birds. Rod. They can sing admirably, They never lose their maiden-heads: I would foole any away To make him merry now: methinks yond rocks yonder Shew like inchanted Cels, where they inhabit. Musick afar off. Pot Birds. Ped. Tis here againe, harke gentle Roderigo, Hark, hark: O sweet, sweet, how the Birds record too! Marke how it flies now every way. O love, In such a harmony art thou begotten, In such soft Ayre, so gentle, lul'd and nourish'd. O my best Mistris! Rod. How he weeps! deere Heaven Give him his hearts content, and me forgive too. I must melt too. Ped. The Birds sing lowder, sweeter, And every note they emulate one another? Lie still and heare: These when they have done their labours, Enter Alinda and Juletta, like old women. Their pretty ayres, fall to their rests, enjoy 'em. Nothing rocks Love asleep, but death. Rod. Who are these? Ped. What. Rod. Those there, those, those things that come upon us, Those grandame things, those strange antiquities. Did not I say these words begot strange wonders? Iul. Now ye may view 'em. Alin. Ha? Iul. The men ye long'd for, Here they are both: now ye may boldy talke with 'em, And never be ghess'd at: be not afraid, nor faint not; They wonder at us; let's maintaine that wonder; Shake not, but what ye purpose doe discreetly, And from your tongue i'le take my part. Alin. Ha? Iul. There: before ye, there, doe not turne coward Mistresse, If ye doe love, carry your Love out handsomely. Alin. 'Tis he and Roderigo; what a peace Dwels in their faces, what a friendly calme Crownes both their soules? Rod. They show as if they were mortall, They come upon us still. Alin. Be not afraid, man, Let 'em be what they wil, they cannot hurt us, Rod. That thing ith' Button'd-Cap lookes terribly. She has Guns in her eyes, the devils Ingeneer. Ped. Come, stand, and let's goe meet 'em. Rod. Goe you first. I have lesse faith: when I have said my Prayersâ Ped. There needs no feare, haile reveren'd dames. Alin. Good ev'en. What doe ye seeke? Ped. We would seek happier fortunes. Rod. That little devill has maine need of a Barber, What a trim beard she has? Alin. Seek 'em, and make 'em, Lie not still, nor longer here, Here inhabits naught but feare. Be constant good, in faith be clear, Fortune will waite ye every where. Ped. Whether should we goe? for we beleeve thy Reverence, And next obey. Alin. Goe to Segonia. And there before the Altar pay thy vowes, Thy gifts, and Prayers: unload thy heavines, To morrow shed thy teares, and gaine thy suit, Such honest noble showres, ne're wanted fruit. Iul. Stand you out too. Rod. I shall be hang'd, or whipt now: These know, and these have power. Iul. See how he shakes. A secure conscience never quakes, Thou hast been ill; be so no more, A good retreat is a great store. Thou hast commanded men of might, Command thy selfe, and then thou art right, Alin. Command thy will: thy foule desires. Put out and quench thy unhallowed fires: Command thy mind, and make that pure; Thou art wise then, valiant, and secure. A blessing then thou maist beget. Jul. A curse else that shall never set Will light upon thee: Say thy Prayers, Thou hast as many sins, as haires. Thou art a Captain, let thy men Be honest, and good thoughts, and then Thou maist command, and lead in chiefe, Yet thou art bloody, and a theife. Rod. What shall I doe? I doe confesse. Alin. Retire, And purge thee perfect in his fire: His life observe; live in his Schoole, And then thou shalt put off the foole. Iul. Pray at Segonia too, and give Thy Offrings up, repent, and live. Musicke within Alin. Away, away: enquire no more, Doe this, ye are rich, else fooles, and poore; What Musick's this? Iul. Retire? 'tis some neat Joy, In honour of the Kings great day: they wonder, This comes in right to confirme their reverence. Away, away, let them admire, it makes For our advantage: how the Captaine shakes? Exit. Ped. This was the Musick. Rod. Yes, yes, how I sweat! I was never so deserted; sure these woods Are onely inhabited with rare dreames, and wonders; I would not be a knave againe, a villaine: Lord, how I loath it now: for these know all Sir, And they would finde me out. Ped. They are excellent women, Deepe in their knowledge, friend. Rod. I would not be traytor, And have these of my Jury; how light I am, And how my heart laughes now me thinkes within me? Now I am Catechiz'd, I would ever dwell here, For there is a kinde of Court of Reformation; Had I beene stubborn friend. Ped. They would have found it. Rod. And then they would have handled me a new way, The devils dump had been danced then. Ped. Let's away And doe their great Commands, and do 'em handsomely: Contrite, and true, for I beleeve Roderigo, And constantly beleeve, we shall be happy. Rod. So you doe well; fall edge or flat O my side; All I can stagger at is the Kings Anger, Which if it come, I am prepar'd to meet it. Ped. The King has mercy, friend, as well as Justice: And when you fall: no more. Rod. I hope the fairest. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na quinta. Enter Master, Seberto: Curio. Cur. We have told ye what he is: what time we have sought him: His nature, and his name: the seeming Boy too, Ye had here, how, and what by your own relation, All circumstances we have cleer'd: That the Duke sent him We told ye how impossible; he knowes him not; That he is mad himselfe, and therefore fit To be your Prisoner, we dare swear against it. Seb. Take heed Sir, be not madder then you would make him; Though he be rash, and suddain (which is all his wildenes) Take heed ye wrong him not: he is a Gentleman, And so must be restor'd and cleer'd in all points; The King shall be a Judge else. Cur. 'Twas some trick That brought him hither: the Boy, and letter counterfeit, Which shall appear, if ye dare now detain him. Mast. I dare not Sir; nor will not: I beleeve ye, And will restore him up: had I known sooner H'ad been a neighbour, and the man you speak him, (Though as I live, he carried a wild seeming) My Service, and my selfe had both attended him How I have us'd him, let him speake. Seb. Let's in, and visit him: Then to the holy Temple: there pay our duties, And so wee'le take our leaves. Mast. I'le waite upon ye. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Sexta. An Altar prepar'd: Solemne Musick.

Holy Altar, daigne to take These for our selves: For the Kings sake And honour these: These sacred lye To Vertue, Love, and Modesty Our wishes to Eternity. Musick. Enter Pedro and Roderigo. Ped. For our selves first, thus we bend Forgive us heaven, and be our friend: Rod. And happy fortune to us send. Ped. To the King, honour, and all Ioy, Long, and happy from annoy. Rod. Prosperous be all his dayes Every new houre, a new praise. Ped. Every minute thus be seene. Both. And thousand honours Crowne the Queene. Musick. Seb. Come to the Altar: let us do our duties. Enter Alphonso, Curio, Seberto. Alph. I have almsot forgot a Church. Cur. Kneele reverently. Alph. For my lost wits (let me see) First J pray: and secondly To be at home againe, and free, And if I travell more, hang me, For the King, and for the Queene, That they may be wise, and seene Never in the Mad-mans Jnne. For my daughter, I would pray But she has made a holly-day, And needs not my devotion now Let her take her own course (heaven,) Whether it be od, or even. Musick. Enter Alinda, &amp; Iuletta like Shepheards. And if that please not, take her you. Seb. A short, and sweet Meditation: what are these here? Alin. Haile to this sacred place, Iul. They are all here, Madam: No violence dare touch here; be secure: My Bilbo Master too: how got he loose againe? How lamentably he lookes: he has had discipline. I dare not let him know my prancks. Seb. 'Tis she sure. Cur. 'Tis certainly. Ped. Ha! doe I dazell? Rod. 'Tis the faire Alinda. Gov. What wonder stand these strangers in? Rod. Her woman by her, The same Sir, as I live, Alph. I had a daughter, With such a face once: such eyes and nose too, Ha, let me see, 'tis wondrous like Alinda, Their devotion ended, I'le marke 'em and neerer. And she had a Filly that waited on her: Just with such a favour, Doe they keepe Goats now? Alin. Thus we kneele, and thus we pray A happy honour, to this day, Thus our Sacrifice we bring Ever happy to the King. Jul. These of Purple, Damask greene Sacred to the vertuous Queene Here we hang. Alin. As these are now Her glories ever spring, and show, These for our selves: our hopes, and loves, Full of pincks, and Ladies gloves, Of hartes-ease too, which we would faine As we labour for, attaine; Heare me heaven, and as I bend, Full of hope: some comfort send. Jul. Heare her: heare her: if there be A spotles Sweetnes, this is she. Musick. Ped. Now Roderigo stand. Rod. He that devides ye Devides my life too. Gov. Pedro, Noble Pedro. Doe not you know your friend? Ped. I know, and honour ye. Gov. Lady this leave i'le crave, pray be not angry, I will not long devide you: how happy Pedro, Would all the Court be now, might they be hold thee? Might they but see you thus and thus embrace you? The King will be a joyfull man beleeve it Most joyfull Pedro. Ped. I am his humble Servant. Nay, good Sir, speake your will, I see you wonder, one easie word from youâ Alph. I dare say nothing My tongue's a new tongue Sir, and knowes his tither, Let her doe what she please, I dare doe nothing, I have been damn'd for doing, will the King know him? That fellow there, will he respect and honour him? He has been look'd upon they say: will he own him? Gov. Yes certainly and grace him, ever honour him, Restore him every way, he has much lamented him. Alp. Is't your will too? this is the last time of asking. Rod. I am sure, none else shall touch her, none else enjoy her. If this, and this hold. Alp. You had best begin the game then, I have no title in her, Pray take her, and dispatch her, and commend me to her, And let me get me home, and hope I am sober: Kisse, kisse, it must be thus: stand up Alinda, I am the more Childe, and more need of blessing. Ye had a waiting woman, one Iuletta, A pretty desperate thing, just such another As this sweet Lady; we call'd her nimble chaps. I pray is this the party? Jul. No indeed Sir, She is at home; I am a little Foot-Boy, That walke a nights, and fright old Gentlemen; Make 'em loose Hats and Cloakes. Alph. And Horses too. Iul. Sometimes I doe Sir, teach 'em the way through ditches; And how to breake their worships shins, and noses Against old broken Stiles, and Stumps. Alph. A fine art. I feele it in my bones yet. Iul. I am a Drum Sir, A Drum at mid-night, ran tan tan tan tan Sir, Do you take me for Iuletta? I am a Page Sir, That brought a letter from the Duke of Medina To have one senior Alphonso, just such another As your old worship worm'd for running mad Sir. Alas, you are mistaken. Alph. Thou art the devill, And so thou hast used me, Iul. I am any thing, An old woman, that tels fortunes. Rodo. Ha. Iul. And frights good people, And sends them to Segonia for their fortunes: I am strange ayers, and excellent sweet voyces. I am any thing, to doe her good beleeve me; She now recovered, and her wishes crown'd I am Iuletta againe, pray sir forgive me. Alph. I dare not doe otherwise, for fear thou should'st still follow me, Prethee be forgiven, and I prethee forgive me too: And if any of you, will marry her. Iul. No I beseech you Sir; My Mistresse is my husband, with her I'le dwell still, And when you play any more prancks you know where to have me. Pedro. You know him Sir. Gov. Know him, and much lament him: The Kings incens'd much, much Sir, I can assure you. Ped. Noble Governour. Gov. But since he is your friend, and now appeares, In honour of this day and love to you sir: I'le try the power I have, to the pinch i'le put it; Here's my hand Roderigo, I'le set you faire again. Rod. And here's mine, to be true, and full of Service. Gov. Your people too, shall have their generall pardons, We'll have all peace and love. Rod. All shall pray for you. Gov. To my house now, and suite you to your worths; Off with these weeds, and appeare glorious: Then to the Priest, that shall attend us here, And this be stil'd Loves new and happy yeare. Rod. The Kings and Queenes, two noble honors meet, To grace this day, two true loves at their feet Alph. Well well, since wedding will come after wooing, Give me some Rose-Mary, and let's be going.
