      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue Vacation still: so little custome comes To buy our Merchandize, and fill our roomes, It would perswade us but for after hope Of better takings quite to shut up shop. But what's the reason? have we no good ware? Or doe the sights and motions in the fayre Please better with their cheape rates? 'tis not fit That we should set so low a prize on wit. For what we shall present you with to day The Bride, we wish you not t'expect a play, Wherein a nesslecock, or youth oth' towne (Borne to more state then wit) 's a gallant growne: When one amongst you laughing at the elfe And at his gullery, thinks upon himselfe. Perhaps there will be some concluding that A person or a place is pointed at; Such make that satire which the pure intent Of th'author meant but harmelesse merriment; Who only labours here in what he can T'expresse a Citizen a Gentleman. Marke well the weaving and the dressing, then Liking the stuffe we hope you'l come agen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Act The first Scene. Enter Old Goodlove, and Theophilus very sad. Goodlove. I say, no more of this, I'le have no brow contracted into wrincles Upon my wedding day: A day of mirth; And thou stand'st like a mellancholick figure Of weeping penitence, when joy should dress Thy cheekes in dimples; it is prodigious That thou should'st only Weare mourning at my nuptials, that have foster'd Thee from an Infant; bred thee to a man; Ranckt thee with Gentlemen, and made thee thought To be what thou appear'st; and thou to grieve For what I count my happinesse! The. Pray' sir conster it Th'expression of my duty. To your love Were I possest of many selves I ow them. That love hath caus'd this passion out of feare Your reputation in the act will suffer Rumor is apt to prey upon occasion: And if the rude mouthes of the multitude Catch hold on a report, they'l multiply it; And make it grow to scandale. You an old man Will marry a young woman. Good. Who cals me old! Dost thou? Now by my beard (Is't not turn'd black agen? I should be loath To sweare by a false coluor) I am young, Like a new spring grown out of a barren winter. I' ave likewise strength and activenesse: looke here else. seemes to eaper and hurt his foot. Beshrew't, the floor's uneven: would 'twere mended I'le have my cornes cut too. Childe we must dance Alwayes at weddings. Am I agen a Bridegrome! And shall I not be lusty? The. Pray Sir, do not Flatter your weaknesse, and decay of strength. Your age begins to grow to a disease: And can you then expresse such youthfull appetite Without being censur'd? Good. Pray no more diswasion Besides my will there is a reason for it: And thou hast cause to joy, Shee brings a portion Will be a large addition to thy state, Which I but live t'encrease. I have no heire Save thee? nor will get any: shalt have all. The. Your welfare sir to me Is an inheritance 'bove any state Fortune can blesse me with. Which to preserve My knees should grow fast to some hallowed pavement, Till mine own dissolution, and no thoughts Busie my minde but prayers. Sir consider The difference 'twixt your disabilite, And her so hopefull fruitfullnesse. T'increase And propagate was the best end of marriage. Then if the meanes be wanting, the end cannot Be perfected: and some in scruple stick not To call it sinne. Good. More urging! when I am dead. Thou shalt have her too. Ha! do'st startle at it? The. Why that would make even your ashes infamous. And tempt the idle gazers on't to scratch Libells upon your Marble. 'Twould be construed That shee in youthfull heat longing for what Your cold defects deni'd her, had enjoyd me To lustfull satisfaction, when she should Have warm'd your bed, and after married me To prevent farther rumor. Nay sir more. Hath she not setled her desire already Upon some one of more proportion'd yeares? 'Twere rare if such a beauty of that growth, Should have her mayden thoughts untoucht with th'appetite Of what instinct doth teach, though she were barr'd Even all converse, so much as not to know The difference of a sex. Good. A causles jelousy Shee's noted to have more perfections Lodg'd in her rich minde, then the outward structure Though beautifull doth promise: she inherits Her Parents vertues, and her education Hath been their only care. I know shee's free From the lest thought may stayne her purity. Therefore no more. The second Scene. To them Raven, and a little after him Mounsieur Kickshaw. Is my Bride yet come Cosen? Raw. Not yet sir. Mounsieur Kickshaw the French Cook's come to prepare dinner. Good. Hee's welcome; let me see him I'le have the feast season'd with all variety Of choice delights. The. To me they will not relish; But like those pills which an unwilling patient Doubting their vertue takes, and turnes the medicine Into a worse disease. Good. Mounsieur you are welcome. Kick. Me tank you Mounsieur. Good. I presume you'l shew your best cunning. Kick. Me make you de French dish; de pulpatone; de frigasie; de gran Kickeshaw an de kickeshaw royall; de macarrone: and two tree dozen ting more for your wedding. Good. Pray Cosin take him first into the cellar. Kick. Remerce Mounsieur. Me drinke two tree cup a your Claret a your vite vine sall make a me lusty. Good. I shall thankfully consider your paines. Kick. Mounsieur ven a me vark is done, you give a me leave to dance two tree foure dance, an kisse a de vench two tree foure time. Oh de French man love a de fine vench vary well. You be de old man Mounsieur, and you love a de young venche me make your de dish sall get sis Childe. Good. Too many on conscience. Kick. If de Madame love me, me get twenty. Good. To your businesse good Mounsieur. Kick. Dat be good businesse, better den go to my vark. Exit. The. Observe you sir this fellow! one that ought To be kickt into manners how he taunts you? 'Twill be the streets discourse, the conduits lecture: And not an idle tongue but will abuse. Your reverend name, which hitherto hath aw'd Th'unbridled rabble. Good. Once more I command thee Leave off this counsaile, growing but from feare, That will admit no reason. Cosin Raven Hasten my Bride: shee makes my patience tyre With so much expection. And harke you cosin. Whisper. Theo. My sun of joy's ecclipst, and all the hopes My fancy painted, by this accident Are blotted out. How have I merited Of heaven thus to be punisht! But I must not Tax providence with an injustice to me, That have deserv'd worse curses for neglect Of my religious duties. Only he, My foster Father to possesse those sweets Love promis'd my inheritance! Wer't another, I'd from his rude hands snatch her in the Church, Before the powerfull words should knit that knot Nothing but death dissolves. The third Scene. To them Maligo and Rhenish. Good. Senior Maligo a most welcome guest. Mal. Your Servant Senior. Good. And Mr. Rhenish. Rav. The Spanish and Dutch Merchants! send there be no wars at the wedding. Rhen. Wee come to witnesse your solemnityes. Good. Welcome Mr. Rhenish: and since you are come so early lets spend the time in conference about the wines we lately spake of. Exeunt. Theo and Raven remayning. Rav. Cousin y'are sad. Would I might know the reason, I'le helpe to put it from you. The. Cousin Raven, Since love, not blood, hath made you weare that title, Though 'tis a secret I would gladly hide, To you I will impart it. Sent with gifts To the faire maid that this day must be Bride To the old man, my treacherous eyes conveigh'd Flames to my heart from hers: which being fixt Upon me, shot their magick influence Of love with such a violence, that I tooke Th'impression e're my bosome was prepar'd And temper'd for it. Rav. This may be a ground For me to work on. The. Duty now and honesty Fought with my passions, and inforc't them back To their unwilling prison: though her eye, Look, gesture; and at parting when I tooke Her hand to kisse it: then she held mine hard: For all these invitations to their liberty I durst not free them; but conceal'd even that Perhaps she wisht to know. Rav. How can you doubt it? They were all signalls that you should assault, And shee would yeeld 'Tis but a modest custom For men to wooe. 'Tis womens only pride To have men court them, not to be deny'd. Indeed it was your fault. The. My vertue rather. Should I like the ingratefull serpent, sting The bosome that hath warm'd me into life? Desire shall burst me first. Yet I must tell you, I am resolv'd to give my passions This satisfaction. When the bridall ceremonies Have had their consummation, I will travaile And leave the cause behind. You may reveale it When I am gone. I shall be prais'd or pittied, For none can blame me. Rav. None! Yes all that heare it. Who will not tax your indiscretion, And want of knowing what belongs to man, That will deny your selfe that right, perhaps None but your selfe can challenge. we are warranted To be indulgent to our selves so farre As worke our own contents by any meanes Conscience or law calls just. Then if the time Prevent it not, try your successe: be suddain: Steale her away and marry her. The. Tempt me not Out of my passion into one more dangerous. 'Twere but a just correction if I kild thee; That would instruct me to an act of error, Repentance could scarce win a pardon for. Rav. My counsail's worth a better fee. Perhaps You feare some trechery in me. Clere your understanding, I'le prove you ought to do it, and I to ayde you. You are his foster sonne, and I his kinsman. You he intends his heire, and yet he must not Neglect me altogether. When they are married Sshe'l find one to get Children. The. Thou art base In thy suspect of her; and but for peace (To which this day ought to be consecrate) It should be punish't. Rav. Y'are too violent. Be calme, and understand demonstrative reason, Children being borne, then are you disinherited. When marrying her ther's an estate will follow Worth thousands: For shee is the only child Her parents ever had. The. And why should you Advise to this, and ayde it? Rav. What more police Could I be guilty of? When his displeasure Hath cast you of (for that way sure hee'l punish The injury) stand not I faire to be Possest of what you loose, the old mans favor? Were you the only object of my hate, The good I do my self would make the act Shew of sufficient malice: but my love Guiding me to'tâ The fourth Scene. To them Goodlove, Maligo and Rhenish: and a little after them Justice Ferret and his wife. The. 'Tis well I am prevented; My rashnesse else had executed justice Upon thy guilt. Forbeare to tempt me farther. Thy friendship's but the shaddow of a true one Dar'st urge such counsail, goodnesse cannot choose but blush at. Rav. Howsoever you receive it I will attempt it. I'le prepare the Bride With this discovery: if she hath desires Shee'l some way give them liberty. The old man I then will prepossesse with jelousy; And so indeere me to him, that my ends Stand alwayes faire in their opinions. A cunning villaine must pretend to save. When most of all he doth intend a grave Exit. Good. I like the rates: may the wines please as well I'le not repent my bargaine. Mal. Trust me sir you have the best sack of Spaine. Rhen. And Rhenish the swan hath none better: yet ther's that will make the crookedst horner in the lane speake latin with the Bedle of Vintiners hall. Good. Mr. Justice Ferret, This was a large expression of your love To come over the water. Fer. 'Twas my wives desire. Good. Kinde Mistresse Ferret. M. Fe. Sir, the respects I beare you, and the obedience I owe my husband that commanded it, brought me over willingly to offer my service to so noble a freind. Good. Your courtesies overcome me. M. Fe. A rot on the best linings of your three pil'd durable, your everlasting almanack of high dayes, feastes and sessions: was it my desire? Thou lyest thou wrong side of a lawyer turn'd outwards: I had better businesse at home. I could have seen if mother Whirl had spun the last pound of flax I sent her, or called at Knocks the weavers for my new Napkins. I have no maides to cudgell their tasks out of. Indeed I can hardly keepe any for such a goat as thou art. Good. Are ye offended with your husband Mrs. Ferret? M. Fer. Obedience forbid it; my head; or if I may use the honorable phrase here without offence, my cap of maintenance. Fer. No no sir; shee was but excusing a few faults. M. Fer. How fir lubber, must the world take notice by you that I have faults or modesty to excuse them? I'le make thee complain a moneth of the fairies for this: the fairies of my nayles I meane; and pretend pinching for pissing in thy shooes, or such night uncleanesse. Fer. Sweet wife forbear a little. Thou wilt vex away thy eating stomack, and here will be excellent cheer. M. Fer. So, so: I thought a Citty feast with a Ram-mutton pasty, and a twelve nookt custard, made with carryers eggs and the out scrapings of isinglas, must tempt you to the charge of six pence over, and six pence back agen. Which with an addition of Clerks fees shar'd, and some garrison'd westphalian neates tongue or red deer pye out of my Chamber cupbord, might have been an intertainment for the Masters of the Parish in your own dyning roome, and all have been payd for too with the return of half emptyed botles. Good. Your wife Mr. Ferret hath call'd something to mind deserves a chiding. Fer. Fye no sir: Shee is somewhat shrewish at home, but the best wife abroadâ M. Fer. Fy, sweet heart now you flatter. 'Tis virtue enough in us to be obedient and dutyfull: we should lay our selves under our husbands feet if they command it. But i'le exalt my self or somewhat else above your head, you malkin of suburb authority set up only to fright crows from the carrion of the common wealth, that it may ly still and corrupt government. Your worship had best bind my tongue to the peace, my nayles should soone bayle it. Soft Musick. The fifth Scene To them Father, Mother, Raven, Bride, and maides attending her. Good. My Bride come? The welcom'st guest that ever blest this roof. Fat. Joy Crown yee both. Good. May your wish be prophetick. But why is she so sad? Moth. 'Tis onely custome. Maides have their feares which by degrees must leave them. M. Fe. May shee make him a happy wife; and prove obedient from my example. Good. Salute my Bride sonne: shee should be thy joy As well as mine. The. I better shall expresse Her entertainment in my pious wishes, Then any complement I will be ready To pay you my best duty. Goodlove and Raven whisper. Bride, Love you meane sir; Give it no other name, might I own that And call it my possession, soone this melancholy Should leave it's mansion, and a Brides full joy Inhabit here. You surely do repine; And it may be this act begets your feare Of being dispossest a fathers love. Which he must now in some proportion Confer on me. The. Let me with reverence sweare Offers to kisse her hand By this white handâ Bride, Let me prevent your oath; Or sweare by another book. Perhaps 'twill be The last warme kisse my lips shall ever feel. kisse. I do beleeve you love me. weeps. The. How shall I Interpret this? how hard she claspt my hand, And prest my lips? as wishing their conjunction Might be eternall. Teares with her last words fell: And in their silent oratory taught me To know my selfe more wretched by the knowledge Of what should make me happy. Good. Can this be? Rav. It hath both possibility and circumstance To make it probable. Good sir observe Their discontents: how they do sympathize, And meet each other. Pray sir let them have An oportunity; Ile be the spy: And cal you to their billing. Good. 'Tis well counsail'd If 't please you Gentlemen I have within Some rarities, whose fight shall be your businesse 'Till we are ready. Sweet you shall forbeare them 'Till you are made their Mistresse. Exeunt. Rav. Whether will you go? Theo. offers to follow. Wast not my plot to get this liberty That you might put your purpose into act If you have any? Why do you delay it? You see shee's willing; I prepar'd her to it. The. Willing to what good Cousin? Rav. To be your Bride. Bride. My blushes speak consent: then if you please Prevent prevention. My desires were never Setled on any other, though I durst not Reveale my passions aw'd by feminine custome, And my strict parents eyes. If you'l receive me, The desperate state of my crosse fortune armes me To any enterprise you'l be my guide in The. I shall be tempted to neglect that duty I would not rashly violate, to possesse All that my wish can covet. Rav. You may hereafter Discourse your loves. Play not away th'occasion. Her's the key of the back gate: take water presently, and away to theâwhispersâI'le follow, get ye a Licence and see all dispacht, Feare not persuit: that I'le hinder. Exeunt. So, the foundations layd on which I'le bulid My selfe a fortune, and with better safety Then making him away: Yet he must not marry her. That were t'enable him if my villany Should be discovered to revenge and punish it. The sixth Scene. To him Goodlove, Father, Mother, Ferret, Mr s. Ferret, Maligo, and Rhenish. The old man! aide me now hypocrisie, Or all miscarries. Oh sir I have search't for you all the house over. Good. Hast observ'd any thing? Rav. I left them here so close condoling. They are questionles stolne to some private place. I'le sent them out, and bring you word. I must absent my self for fear my joy For this faire entrance doth discover me. Exit. Good. Father in expectation I have suddainly Bethought me of a businesse. Fat. Pray' what is't? Good. You see I am old; unfit for such a Bride. Suppose I make a resignation, And give my right up to another man, One that your daughter and your self should like of. What if my son were Bridegroom? 'twere a match Would carry more proportion. Fat. None more gladly, So you'l confer upon him an estate Answering her portion. Good. It shall be considered of. Wee'l know their likings. Fer. Will you not Marry her your self then after all these preparations? Why sir the world takes notice of it, and it may concern your credit. Good. Your husband counsailes well M r s. Ferret. M. Fe. I cannot in obedience but allow of his wisdom. Thou changling nurst with the milke of an asse whence thou derivest thy great empty noddle: must you hinder a good motion? Are there not cuckolds enough already? Good. Wher's the Bride Cousin? Raven returns. Rav. Vanish't sir, not to be found. They are questionlesse run away together: the water gate is fast lockt, and the key without. You were doubtfull sir, and would hardly give credit to my relation. Fat. How! stolne away together! what plots are these? Good. Yours sir, to undoe the reputation Of an old man. Fat. Rather your own, to ruine? My only comfort. Fer. Proceed you sir in your late motion and this difference will soone find a reconciliation. Is not the Gentleman his only son. Good. No sonne of mine, but the most monstrous birth Of base ingratitude that ever made Charity frozen. I found him in the fields, An Infant almost starv'd, and bred him up. It seems for this. Moth. Alasse our child's undone. Fat. Pursue the villaine. If the extremity Of Law can do it, I will hang him for't. Rav. I should be glad of that. Fat. If I can prove sir your least knowledge makes you A party in't, your state or mine shall crack for't. Good. Do you sir threaten me in mine own house.? My credit's more at stake, then that I should Be calme: but once I give you priviledge. Fat. Come lets' to water: we perhaps may take them. Rav. Yes at the Tower questionlesse. Exeunt. Father and Mother. Fer. Sir if I find them in my precinct. M. Fer. What will you do? If thou dost the least wrong to the loving couple, though I burn for it, I will roast thee alive and sell thy greasie kidnies for kitchinstuffe. Kickshaw enters with plate under his cloake. Rav. A good proceeding hitherto. Kick No vench, no veding? Me bid you adiew Mounsieur; you no need a me varke. Good. Farewell Mounsieur. Reward him Cosin. Kick. Here be revard: two, tree silver dish, and tree, foure spoone make Mounsieur a jentleman an buy de fine vench beyond de water. Me no stay for de reward. Exit. Good. Ha hah hah he. Laughs. Mal. Why laugh you sir? make you no more account of so great an injurie? Good. They'r gone: and now I'le tell ye gentlemen, I knew the boy did love her, and I meant He only should enjoy her; but pretended My self would marry her, thereby to worke A greater portion out of her covetous Father; And to insinuate my selfe into A perfect knowledge of his true estate. Now since h' hath play'd the wagge, preventing me Of mine own plot, you all shall in and witnesse My act of love to him: I'le instantly Confirm him my full heire, reserving something For you my kinsman: whom I desire Use your best diligence to finde them out, And bring them home, but coupled. And you gentlemen Dispense with this dayes accident, your cheer To morrow shall be doubled. Exeunt. Rav. How is this? My plot's prevented too; curse on the charme That witcheth you to love him. Bring them home, But coupled: fine employment. Yet 'tis well You tell me your intent. My brain must work Some more succesfull mischiefe that may hit. No villaine can prosper without wit.

      <field name="fulltext">The second Act the first Scene. Squirrell, and after him a Drawer. Squir. Your deligence knaves, or I shall canvase your pole davyes, deafen not a gallant with your anon anon sir, to make him stop his cares at an over-reckoning. Can a mansion purchased and payd for be converted into a house of enterteinment, and subsist without commings In and goings Out? Now sir what say you? Dra. The reconing sir for Mr. Serge the Mercer, and the Scriveners wife, that have been these two houres in the yellow bed-Chamber. Squi. And what had they? Dra. A dish of collops and egges, and wine. Squi. Sixteen shillings! 'tis well. Dra. But her husband had half a quire of paper and bastard by himself in the Buls-head: which would hardly keep him emploi'd below stayres; he was going up to peep through the key hole. Squi. Sawcy Scrivener! peep through a key hole! shouldst have had him by the eares. Dra. His peeping through a hole cost them long since. Squi. And this came freely! Dra. He woundred sir it was no more. Exit. Dra. Squi. Go carry the blades in the Lion a pottle of sack from me: their roaring must be maintain'd out of my profit. They are good procurers; and help now and then to stane of an over heated Cittizen that persues his game, too eagerly. Though my holy-day squires of the city bring me in most gain, my free Knights of the suburbs, the erants of Lincoln-Inn fields, where their randevous makes the gunpowder house terrible, and the smock tribute due to their order is daily and nightly exacted: these I say are the best mainteiners of my profits occasion; and Squirrell must venter cracking to maintaine them whilst his sign and bush lasts. The second Scene. To him Theophilus and Bride. Y'are welcome sir. The. The Master of the house! Squi. The poore owner of some goods and chattels; moveables and immoveables, with a small stock to drive a trade. The. We would desire the use of a roome. Squi. You shall be accommodated. The. We expect a frieind; 'till he comes this may serve. Squi. What you please sir. A towell sirrah quickly. Exit. Bri. Thou seem'st sweet hart as if th'hadst feares within thee. We may securely now discourse our loves, And weary time with words, 'till we are fit To act our wishes. The. The fulnesse of my joyes Happ'ning so suddaine ere I was prepar'd To taste them with an appetite, hath bred A surfet in me. Bri. Now you smell of flattery I would not have you court what you possesse with any attribute above its merit. If my being yours you count your happinesse, Let us be suddain to confirme our selves Mutually happy, e're our parents rage Can reach us to prevent it. The. That word parents. Makes me reflect on my ingratitude: Being greater far then infamous recordes Did ever punish; and like pleasant dreames My joyes are chang'd to nothing. Bri. Suddaine dumbs: Whence are they? to my selfe I am not guilty Of a behaviour that should merrit this. I prethee let me blush, and kisse away The clowdes hang on thy brow. No discontent Should interpose where equall love hath mixt Equall desires; and for the noble end No base dependance. For could I but think Thy soule did harbor any bastard thought Which goodnesse might not father, I would back To my disgrace; and confidently meet My parents anger; all th'affronts of rumor; And what the rabble pleas'd rather then stay To nurse it to a growth. The. Then pray' return; But not to your disgrace; all shall be thrown Upon my guilt. And though my love (unstain'd With the least blemish of impure affection) Gave th'act allowance, I'le belye my self, And say I did enforce you; which the law May punish with my life. I'le give it up, To end th'affliction of my soule; divided 'Twixt love to you, and duty to that man I have so wrong'd. Bri. Can love admit such scruples? Or is't thy coldnesse? I was too too credulous. But the necessity deny'd more tryall. Here's a pretence indeed. The. Can there be greater? Ingratitude's a monster. Shall I then Repay that man with injurie, that gave My almost starv'd life warmth, and made me breathe Though to be miserable Bri. Thou dost surely Want the best part of man, and art not capable. Of resolution. Such a coward spirit Lodgeth not here. I now suspect thy worth, And blame my rashnesse. The. Why should I be taxt With such defect? Know then I dare deserve you By any enterprize that may be credible. Invention cannot fancy an employment I would not manage to confirm my love Worthy your best opinion, only this My conscience frights me from. Bri. Why then farewell. Passion will guide me some where, goodnesse guard me From a despaire; and whatsoever end I am dispos'd for, I'le remember thee Deny'st thy self good in denying me. Offers to go away. The third Scene. To them the Drawer with a towell. Dra. What's your wine sir? The. Presently. Stay. Puls back bride. Dra. Your pleasure sir. Bride weepes. The. I meane not you. Dra. I know your meaning sir. Exit. Drawer. The. Why should those pearles be wasted, Till they enrich my funerall? Distraction Hurries my thoughts, and hindreth them from ord'ring Any resolve. Have I proceeded hitherto? And shall I now give back? The infamy Sticks on my name already; and the stain Thrown on it by the black mouth'd multitude For being ingratefull, by bare satisfaction Cannot be washt away. Her vertue likewise will be suspected. I must therefore on Since reason prompts me to it. Love shall excuse The act, and my neglect of other dues. Sweet I am now resolv'd. Bri. Resolv'd! to what? The. To consummate our wishes. Bri. Now I think on't 'Tis better not. I find my flame abated: My lov's not half so violent, I can stay, And try you first. The. How's this? why will you now Change your intent that seem'd so resolute? 'Twill make us be the subject of discourse, And libelling ballads; every goships feast Will make mirth from our shame. Bri. No matter for't I now begin t'examine what's in you So taking. An indifferent handsome frame; The superficies neatly varnisht over. In it should dwell a soule rich as the building Doth promise to the eye; but I suspect it. Thy actions suite not with a noble spirit. Thy lov's but wanton passion, not the vertue Should give it warrant. He that would be mine, Must in his mind as well as outward shine. Agen farewell. Offers again to go. The. Stay: I have fool'd my selfe Into a maze of errors, and do want M' instructive part to guide me. All my faculties Of soule are puzled, and at every turning. Do mate themselves with doubts. Why should you feigne This cruelty to kill me, when my joyes Were almost strengthned in the life you gave them, So far as not to feare a new relaps? Having corrected all the accidents Of my diseas'd love, will you now desist To make a perfect cure? Bri. Medicines apply'd To an unwilling or distrustfull patient Their working's hindred. You have ill receiv'd The meanes; and what succedes, your selfe is guilty of; No cruelty of mine. The. Are you resolv'd then To send me back to my first misery? And anew make me wretched? Bri. 'Till confirm'd Ther's merit in you. The. Is my want of that Onely suspected by you? Heare me first, And then farewell. May I be curst beyond Recovery by my penitence; let heaven Ne're make me master of a wish that may Include my least good, if I marry youâ Bri. How's this? The. Untill your parents free consent, And the good liking of that injur'd man Allow it publike ceremony Bri. Thou canst not Figure a more impossibility. It must be never then. Call in thy vow; The rashnesse will dispense with't The. That might give A new occasion for your cruell wit To tax me with new weaknesse. Know I can Be man as well as lover; and am fixt In my resolve, beyond the power of change By any passion. Bri. I have play'd too long With the false shaddow of my happinesse, And mockt away the substance. By my love Zealous as ever kindled a chast flame In any maidens brest, I but dissembled To try thy patience, and beget discourse. I am so well confirm'd in my opinion Of thy desert, that should a thousand tongues Swoln with detraction, break their tum'rous bags, Venting from thence the most corrupted malice That ever made man infamous to me It should be flatt'ring praise. The. Did you dissemble? Could she who through her eyes conveigh'd her heart, And the assurance of her best desires When other meanes were silenst; shee that taught My equall passion to interpret lookes, Teares, smiles, and read in those dumb characters Her soule, dissemble? or with any counterfet Disturb his joy that only from her truth Derives it true possession? Jealousie May then be warranted, since 'tis a vertue Noble and masculine when justly grounded. Was not your love dissembled? meant you not To make a property of these proceedings For some ends of your own? Dispose your self As your will guides you; 'twill but make my life Somewhat more tedious wanting your society: Besides whom I renounce all woman kind. Bri. I man besides thee. Do not tempt thy fate Too far beyond a reconciliation With opportunity; as yet it serves. If this day give thee not possession of me Never expect it. I shall find a place To keep out shame. In some chast fellowship I'le learn to pay religious vows to heaven. And pray since here we cannot, we may be Happy heareafter in eternity. weeps. The. Dissolve not with those teares my passive heart That weeps within me. They will almost tempt me To worse then sacrilege. Anon we will Consult and practice something. The fourth Scene. To them Squirell. After him Raven. Squi. By the description he makes of you a gentleman below enquires for you. I was not curious to aske your name, but I know his. The. My cosin Raven! Squi. The same sir. The. Pray' direct him to us. Squi. What's your wine sir? The. When he comes. Squi. This is sure some hide-bound student, that proportions his expence by his pension; and wencheth at Tottenham court for stewed prunes and cheescakes. Hee's not acquainted with the generous way, and I shall have the lesse scruple to cosin him. Exit. The. Be not so clowdy sweet; our sun of joy May shine at full, and cleere those dusky mists; Obscure it for a season. Welcome Cosin Unto our expectation. Rav. The wine boy. within. Anon anon sir: by and by. The. Cosin the news? how go matters? Rav. The tempest's layd, but they are scatter'd by it. Some to the Tower; to Pancrace others run. Noise fils the roomes within, and in the street The rabble is convented; where a jury Of wide mouth'd oyster wives, to whom the foreman A one legg'd ballad singer opens tunably The merry case, not onely do acquit you, But prayse the act; and sweare a ballad of it Would out sell all the libells ever yet M. P. subscrib'd to. The. 'Tis an act indeed Drawer enters with wive and Exit. Deserves reproach Rav. Deserves a Chronicle A legend of delight. Which when 'tis read By the learn'd youth of Hogsden after supper, Shall cause such laughter 'mongst th'attentive family, That cheap-side wives shall curse the noise, for sowring The market womens creame and buttermilke. The. Y'are very pleasant Cousin. Some mans jelousy. Would soone interpret it to be but scorn. What you intend itâ Rav. Cosin it is my zeale Makes me thus light and ayery; yet rather Then my behaviour should give way unto The least suspition, I'le put on a shape Of like dejectednesse, as seems to cloath Your melancholick Bride; But how 'twould show Th'occasion makes it doubtfull. If shee'l weep Upon her wedding day, let it not be But that shee apprehends th'ensuing night Brings on her joyfull feares. Cosin lets drink A health to the effect: a jolly boy Will follow feare not. Drinkes Bri. Yet the cause is hindred. Pray' let your counsailes in our danger be Movers unto more serious thoughts and actions. Our peace is not yet settled; and we doubt What the successe may be which our proceedings Are destin'd to. Rav. Successe! the best that time, And th'application of endeavours can Crown your desires with. Yet I must confesse Your parents storme, and threaten death if law By any trick can urge it. But the old man Seems to forgive you; onely his intent Is to dispose his state some other way Then leave the least part yours. Which to comply for With any least submission I should rather Banish my self his fight, and cancelling All th'obligations of indebted duty, Scorn to be flatter'd into payment of it. Cosin be rul'd by me; confirme yourself In this possession. You may find delights Enjoying one another though restrain'd A generall liberty. Get into the Country Remote enough, but where you may receive Weekly intelligence and meanes from me; Which I'l supply you with in a proportion For moderate expence. As things grow ripe I can informe you. As it hath been ever, It shall be still my care to do you offices (For mine own ends.) The. You have my deerest cosin Given large testimony of your love; Requitall must be studied. But for this You have advis'd to, a quite different course Is here resolv'd on, and my vow hath seal'd it. I must returne to labor a consent From those I have so wrong'd; which if deny'd me, I never must enjoy what I desire Above my self. Rav. Consent! 'twould soone be had, If I prevent it not. A noise within. What noise is that? Perhaps some that pursue you; hide your selves; Her's an inner roome. Puts them into another roome. The fifth Scene. To him Squirell peeping. Squi. So, so, this is right gentlemen; one for another. Yet shee lookes not like carrion of Mr. Ravens leaving; I have seldome known him turn over any flesh to another that hath not been sufficiently tainted. Rav. This accident what ere it was hath gain'd me an opportunity. Squirell thou must be intelligent and trusty. Hast observ'd? Squi. Why is she a wench? Rav. Ther's a question now to bring thy wit in question, and condemn thee for a puny politick in the smock state. What blades are in the house? Squi. Rashbe, Spilman, Poinard, and others. Rav. And they made the noise? Squi. Right sir. Rav. Will they attempt? Squi. Any thing for you sir. Shall it be an affront? Rav. More, more: send them up; and applye thy self with cunning as thou expectest ever to thrive by the chostly sins of wenching. Squi. I have known you Mr. Raven a bird of the flesh these many yeares, and if I should not respect an old standard. Exit. Rav. Away then to the execution. Cosin our feares was causelesse. Theo. and Bride come forth againe. The. Had they been Such as it spake them, we might well have staid And yeelded to them. We had only seem'd Compell'd to what we freely must performe. The sixth Scene. To them the Blades. Rav. Have you businesse with any here sir? 1 Bla. I do not use to answer sir. Sweet Lady. The. What fellow's this? 1 Bla. Fellow? one that will admit no fellow sir. Fellow! Fellow your selfe. The. More! I suspect some rudenesse. Pray Cosin call the Master of the house. 2 Bla. The Master of the house is the master of the house; but we will master both him and you unlesse you deliver. The. My purse? 3 Bla. Your she familiar sir; we would be familiar with her. The. You are foule mouth'd 1 Bla. How sir Cittizen! do you think e're you are quite fledge in the nest, with the shell of your cuckows egs upon your head to confront us? We are blades; and blades must be scoured. Bri. What meane you sir? 2 Bla. Your servant sweet Lady. The. She is none of your pleasure Ladies, 'tis a wrong direction of your base thoughts. 3 Bla. Base! Cit. thou deserv'st the cane: but this Ladies goodnesse commands thy pardon. Bri. You are mistaken sir, I have no skill In th'art of prostitution. 1 Bla. You shall be instructed Lady; 'tis the Blades profession. The. Forbear your rudenesse; if you must be wicked. Let your temptations be directed where The sin is grown to custome. Her chaste eares Never receiv'd such sounds. 2 Bla. Come come, you must sweet Lady. Bri. What sir? 1 Bla. Along with us: we are company indeed. Who would let a Cit. (whose teeth are rotten out with sweet meates his mother brings him from goshippings) breathe upon her vernish for the promise of a dry neats tongue and a pottle of Rhenish at the stillyard, when she may command a Blade to toss and tumble her? and (if she should pawn a petticoat) beat such a fellow as this is till he hath redeem'd it. The. Advantage may do much; but I would wish ye Desist, and be more civill: 'tis not th'odds else Shall fright me from attempting to correct you. 2 Bla. Correct us! nay then along Lady. One drawes &amp; stands at the door, whilst the other carry her away. Bri. Help me sweet heart, will ye use violence? The. Ye cowards, 'gainst an unarm'd man! Rav. May not I passe? 3 Bla. Not through me sir, unlesse you were a Blade; the fraternity may claime some privildege. The. Then arme me Justice. Theo. throwes his cloake on the others point; gets within him and takes away his sword. 3 Bla. Hold, for heavens sake hold. The. Thy life! I scorn it: 'tis too base to pay A satisfaction; she must be redeem'd At a far higher rate. Exit. Rav. My wishes issue In all things yet. Are you much hurt sir? 3 Bla. A scratch or so. If the rest scape no better, I shall beleeve there is more valour in some, then what's onely shown at a Finsbury muster. Exit. Ent. Squi. hastily. Squi. Your ayd master Raven, or we shall have murder done. The young gentleman sir, the young gentlemanâ Exit. Rav. I hope so, if my plot succeeds. This was an unlookt businesse thrust upon me. But I must practise my hipocrisie With best art; else suspition may discover The guilt that's in me. Sure he's dead by this time, Unlesse his skin be proof against their points. If one of them should fall, and he escape The rest I will suborne to make his life The lawes. Thus villany like a pregnant mother From the successe of one begets another. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The third Act the first Scene. Theophilus beating in the Blades before him; Bride, Raven and Squirrell. 1 Bla. Hold hold; I am hurt. 2 Bla. I bleed too. 1 Bla. If my sword had had a point, I had payd him home. Squi. I beseech you sir be pacified. The. Sir if your house be a place priviledg'd For such abuses, it must be inform'd of, That law may punish it. But for these shadows, Mockshapes of valour; twere it not for stayning My innocent hands, I would compell your soules Black as they are to give me satisfaction As ye expire them. Bri. Prethee sweet no more; Tis well th'art safe. 1 Bla. We do acknowledge an error sir; and for satisfaction sir and to preserve peace, our weapons shall be deliver'd up to the Master of the house. Rav. Mischiefe upon their basenesse; how are they Declin'd from men! I hop't one desperate thrust Or stroake e're this had sent him to his quiet, And cut off farther labor to contrive it; It racks my invention. Yet I cannot rise To what I ayme at but by his ruine. 1 Bla. We hope you'l do the like sir. The. If I were confident of safety. But you must give me leave being one that can Command my selfe and passion. This with me Serves as an instrument of peace, and may Fright an intended mischiefe from me. Good sir Retaine their weapons as you'l answer it At your own perill. Squi. Surely Mr. Raven, you were mistaken; this is no wench. Exit. 2 Bla. Baffled and hurt! we may revenge it sir. The. Ye properties of men, made up of rags And outside onely, shoot your threats at those That feare the bubbles. Think not here to triumph As o're your easie guls, that must redeem Their safties from the danger of your furies, By battering downe with th'engine of their purse Some sconch your drunken valour in a taverne Hath built with sack. 3 Bla. So sir. The. Be gone, for feare you urge me To more impatience: Yet my charity Affords ye this good counsayle. The world's full Of brave imploiments for men capable. Y'have persons, but want mindes for actions That might ennoble ye. Honor attends On warre; ye only call your selves by names Of Captaines and Lieftenants here where peace Is most secure, but when your drunken quarrells Disturb her. Go to th'warres, and save the Citty The chargeable reparing of their prisons. 1 Bla. Wee'l think upon your satire. 2 Bla. Take the scabbard too. My belt I'le pawn for a scarfe to hang my arme in, that the not wearing of a sword may have pretence; 'till whose recovery I am degraded from a Blade to a Battoone. Exeunt the Blades. Bri. How lovely showes this valour? That in men There should be so much difference. The. Why so sad Coz? What think you on? Rav. I was contriving mischiefe. The. Mischiefe! 'gainst whom? Rav. I shall betray my selfe. A merry harmlesse mischiefe; whose relation Shall make the Ice of melancholick spleenes Dissolve with laughter. 'Tis a prety plot Upon those roarers. The. Pray impart it then. Rav. There is a passage in't unperfect yet. How apt is guile to be its own discoverer I almost had spoil'd all. The. I do begin weighing the circumstance To be possest With a suspect of his sincerity. Hee's surely trecherous; and perhaps occasion'd The late attempt upon me, so to have Remov'd the bar he feares might shut him out From an inheritance I never coveted. I must not be too credulous. What's the reason You are so clowdy Cosin? In your eyes Me thinks I read sad thoughts; your merry mischiefe Promis'd more lightsomnesse. Rav. I cannot yet Fancy a good conclusion; it hath passages That would beget a neare one. Are you Cosin Resolv'd on your returne? or will you practise As I advis'd? The. Doth that concerne your plot? Rav. I mind no plots; my mind is onely busie To make you safe. The. Safe! which way meane you Cosin? Rav. Pray' wrest it not. Suppose those baffled roarers Should in revenge way-lay you: they are mischievous; And if you should miscarryâ The. No great matter: There were an end of misery. You need not Be much sollicitous to prevent my danger; Since on my death depends the assurance Of an estate to you. When you enjoy it, If my cold ashes might be capable Of such expressions, they should dance for joy Fortune had so rewarded you, that merrit Above her flattery: which she but practis'd When I was interpos'd by greater accident Then ever yet made learned error give her The prophane attributes of a deity. Rav. He surely doth suspect me. The. Had I faln (As ten to one I might, had not the cause Given me the greater ods.) Had you contriv'd itâ Rav. How's that! your jelousy is an unkindnesse My love deserves not. The. I hope you are not guilty, That catch th'uncertain meaning of my words E're they are perfected; and preinterpret Thoughts that had never being! I may then Justly have doubts. For innocence unmov'd At a false accusation, doth the more Confirme it selfe; and guilt is best discover'd By its own feares. Rav. Pray fancy what you please To strengthen your suspition: 'tis indeed So weakly grounded, that unlesse you prop it With better circumstances, your own shame Shall ruine it, and justifie my truth. I must out fac't. The. Your own impatience May serve for one. This house you sent us to For ought I know a Brothell. You are noted For one that surfets in the pleasant sin: And he that without scruple dares persue it, Dares without scruple do or be consenting To any mischeife from whose execution The meanes may be derived that will maintaine His lust and riot. Rav. 'Tis not well that you Digresse from your first plea to this foule satire. You should not tax my life, since it hath done you Those offices deserve (besides your thanks) Your most indulgence to my greatest faults Nor doth it show of noble nature in you To credit infamy from a report, Untill confirm'd by knowledge. Howsoever You have declar'd your self in your suspition; And hence forth I desist: my practises Have been so fruitlesse. One I had contriv'd To Crown th'expression of my zealous care In your affaires. You might have us'd my love To better ends. Bri. Pray' sir continue it, And reconcile your passions, he shall be No more in such an error, to mistake The ayme of your intentions. From my warrant He shall agen be settled in's opinion Of your fidelity, not to be alter'd By after accidents. Rav. When once suspected, Can I presume that any undertaking Will be received well? Bri. Prethee sweet remove Th'ill grounded jealousy and heare him. Hee'l Propose what may be usefull. Rav. I shall never But feare hereafter all my actions Will not be fairely constred. The. It must be By that feare onely. Cosin I nere brought My doubts to such a positive conclusion, But that they might be chang'd to better truth By your least satisfaction. If you have Design'd ought for our good, and that my judgement Gives it allowance, no suspition shall Hinder the execution. Rav. Might I be Confirm'd no missinterpretation should Wrest the intent. The. I am not capable Of a new doubt, unlesse your doubts beget it. Then pray' impart your counsaile. Rav. Thus it is. I have a little country house neer Epping; Thither I would convey you. You may there Conceale your selfe some time; In which I'le practise A reconciliation with their loves By all the meanes that my invention Can worke. Nor thinke I have sinister ends; But faire, as ever perfect friendship made Glorious in the successe. Bri. Prethee consent To this faire motion. The. Cosin to expresse How far I am from feare of any trechery You might be guilty of; what you advise to Shall be put into instant act. This key Will leade you where my husbandry hath stor'd Something from honest gain, without least wronging The old mans trust; I pray' convey it hither Where wee'l expect you. Rav. Please you to command My store; what I am Master of is yours I shall gaine time to plot; my suddaine pollicies Wanted a right foundation. within. They are here an't please your worship. Bri. We are anew betray'd. Rav. Mischiefe forbid it. Within. You shall have justice feare it not. Within. You may take my warrant gentlemen. The second Scene. To them the Blades, Justice Ferret, Mr s. Ferret, and Raven. Rav. The Justice! then all's marr'd. Fer. What Mr. Bridegroome? M. Fe. And Mistresse Bride! send you joy. Fer. Are you the ? Mrs. Fer. Let me speake sir parrat; must you be repeating your sessions lecture, and I in place? Squi. The Justice knowes them. Best shift for your selves, least you be found the most delinquents, and forced from your power of pleasure here to peepe through a grate or taste the charity of Bridewell. Exeunt Blades. M. Fe. You are complaind of by these ? Fer. Ha! whether are they gone that accused you? The. Without their accusation I submit My selfe to th'law. And if you have direction To use your power, let it acquit this gentlewoman From the ensuing scandale, I'le be patient With any punishment the just revenge Of those I have o wrong'd can lay upon me. M. Fe. Is she not your wife? The. Heaven hath forbid it, and my penitence Restores her back. Bri. It shall not by my hopes Of comfort in thy love. If your commission Be for our apprehension.â M. Fe. Truly Mistresse Bride I should be glad to apprehend you in bed together: 'twas expected all had been cock sure by this. 'Twas but a plot of your old foster father to pretend marrying her himselfe when he meant her onely for you. Rav. They will discover all; curse on the accident That brought them hither. M. Fe. To expresse it more fully, and how deere you are to him, he hath conferred his whole estate upon you. My Worshipfull husbands hand is to the writing. Fer. It is indeed sir. M. Fe. Is it so sir? as if my word were not sufficient! Rav. Heare them attentively, and then your eare. The. I do heare words that must be scan'd and constred. Fer. He appointed that gentleman to find you out. The. Amazement hath possest me wholly. Rav. Although my person came before you, sir, You were the first deliverer of this joy, Which I conceal'd for reasons: but desire I now may finish all in private. M. Fer. Talke your fill sir, whilst I drinke mine. drinks. Rav. Cosin I know you wonder at the strangenesse Of all: for which take this briefe satisfaction. You are betrayd to receive punishment, For what you rather do deserve a Crown. This Justice and my selfe had the instructions All's nothing but a plot to get you back. The. Why then would you pretending love conceale it? And mock my feares with such diversity Of dangerous accidents, you brought upon them? Rav. Alasse had I reveal'd the circumstance Of his profest love; fiegn'd intentions And the smooth traps were layd to catch you in, I know your nature of such easie temper, You rather would have flattered you selfe Into beliefe of them, then your own danger. 'Twas my prevention. The. How I shall determine, And reconcile these differences to truth Is hard. Be firme my resolution: I will be satisfied, and yet prevent The danger that is her. My Cosin Raven Is certainly a villaine. You have been sir The comfortablest messenger of pardon The ere ingag'd a man; and if you please To be the instrument of farther good, You'l find us gratefull. M. Fe. Command both me and mine husband. The. Pray' take this gentlewoman to your care, Whilst I go back to make acknowledgement Of the greate benefits are done me. Bri. I will along with thee likewise. Rav. By no meanes Let him be satisfied of all that's past Which I'le instruct him how without his danger, Whilst you are absent. The. Shall shee be your charge? Fer. She shall go to our house. M. Fe. And welcome with my husbands good liking. To your house? as if the enterteinment of constables on a sharing day were not chargeable enough, but you must complement away wine and sweet meats. 'Tis enough that we wish them well; let others do them good. Fer. Sweet wife be patient; I have found out another way. Rav. Observe me sir, I will discover more. D'you thinke 'tis fit my cosin go alone sir? Suppose those baffled roarers (whom he did Justly correct) way lay him; may there not Be danger in't? Fer. You say well sir. Standish and Dash my Clerkes shall a long with him. Or what thinke you of my neighbour Catch the Marshalls man? the sight of him would fright them. Rav. Do you marke that sir he would have you guarded. Would you were off: I'le tell you more by th'way. I'le along with you Cosin, so I may Borrow a weapon. Squi. You may have one of these. The. Lett's on; I will returne to our full joyes; I go but to prepare them. And find out The meaning of these riddles. Bri. My prayers go with thee. Exit. Rav. By this, what I intend shall be conferr'd Upon those roarers, that will carry circumstance To make it creditted, and quit me wholly Of all suspect. In mischeife ther's content, When we on others lay the punishment. Exit. Fer. Come Mistresse Bride, wee will walke and see some rarities and antiquities till they return. There is one in the neighbourhood is stor'd with them; as if he had translated the Capitall hither. M. Fe. The motion's good: it should have been mine sir. You shall see the feathers of a Phenix; the beake of a Pelican, and the skins of Birds, beasts and fishes, stufft with hay, enough to bring down the market. For coynes and meddalls he hath those with inscriptions that speake their date 500 yeeres before the use of letters. He hath the fingers and toes of a Colossus, and three hayres of a giants upper lip, each of them as big as a bull rush. Then he hath the the members of a pignie, that cannot be discern'd but through a multiplying glas. Yet it is thought he would gladly part with all he hath for the Phylosophers stone; I or the Unicornes horne at Windsor. Fer. Come come, he hath those things a prince might glory to be owner of, and 'tis bravely done of him to affect them. Bri. Such sights will be delightfull. I must strive In what I may my sad thoughts to withstands; Which do presage some mischief's neere at hand. Exeunt. Squi. Y'are welcome with a mischiefe to the occasion that brought you hither. Here hath been attendance for a quart of wine and that not payd for. Some better customers, or I shal crack without credit. My Blades baffled too! Their losse must be repair'd upon the next advantage. The third Scene. To him Kickshaw like a Gentleman. You are welcome sir. Kick. Pray' take a me cloake: me back be so hot, will burn a hole in it.

Yet my Ladyes gentlewoman Bit by her Monkey, sweares by her lost maydenhead The world hath not a Balsame like to that Her closet yeelds; when 'tis perhaps but oyle A little aromatiz'd for lamps. Rhe. You are learned likewise in antiquities. Hor. A little sir. I should affect them more, were not tradition One of the best assurances to show They are the things we thinke them. What more proofes (Unlesse perhaps a little circumstance) Have we for this or that to be a peece Of delphos ruines? or the marble statues Made Athens glorious, when she was suppos'd To have more images of men then men? A weatherbeaten stone with an inscription That is not legible but through an optick, Tells us its age; that in some Sibills cane Three thousand yeares ago it was an altar. 'Tis satisfaction to our curiosity; But ought not to necessitate beliefe. Mal. Antiquities sir are grown of late good merchandize. Hor. Th'affection of some Princes hath begot An imitation, and 'tis nobly done. For by such things mans knowledge is inform'd In principles of art, and many times They light upon instruction by them, that Direct invention to recover what Neglect or ignorance hath lost. Rhe. Pray' sir what are the rarities and antiquities you have? Hor. Nor Pliny sir, nor Gesner ever made Discription of a creature, but I have Some particle thereof: and for antiquity I do not store up any under Grecian. Your Roman antiques are but modern toyes Compar'd to them. Besides, they are so counterfet With mouldings, 'tis scarce possible to find Any but copies. Mal. Yet you are confident of yours that are of more doubt. Hor. Others from their easinesse May credit what they please.

But a few houres since there happened a dangerous uproare about this gentlewoman; and the delinquents came to complain first. But had they not conveigh'd themselves away, they should have been punished. M. Fe. With what tro? a reproofe or a jeer out of your table book notes, enlarg'd with a peece of a charge; then with a half bribe and single fees they are released to boast how cheap they have scaped. Come come you shall back to this house, and be severe, and wise and say little, let mine be the speaking part, yours the doing: I'le make them come off and on roundly.

There is a malice in the stars that guide me, Which yet seem wanton, as their influence Were but a sportive mockery to show The various fates that do depend upon it. I have had strange deliverance; but th'event Of this is full of horror. I pray' gentlemen Do not make me the object for a quarrell.

The Merchants? were they not? Rav. Doubtlesse the same. The. What Gentlewoman should that be they askt for? Rav. Some Bonaroba they have been sporting with. Your outlandish merchants are notable barterers for such English ware Many of them keep their recreations at pension; and sometimes two copartners will share as even nightly. The. That's strange; if love will brooke no rivalls, lust should Being the more raging passion. Rav. 'Tis common. The. How common? Rev. Wenching is like freindship hath all things common. The. The mist is great: have we not lost our way? We might e're this have got to th'waters side Though we had trod a labyrinth. Raven draws and runns at Theophilus, and he turning back wounds Rav. Rav. Over this stile and then The. Ha! what devill mov'd thee to attempt it. Rav. Pox on these French blades; no point! I have payd a debt to all my vaine attempts With mine owne ruine. Hell hath left me yet One meanes t'expresse my malice. In my death Dye to all knowledge of thy self; the world Besides me ownes it notâ Fals and lyes as if he were dead. The. I cannot give Utterance unto my thoughts; the narrow passage Is choakt up with a multitude, that strive Which should first issue forth. How fruitlesse envy Brings on its own destruction! Innocence Is proofe 'gainst all the battery of malice: And he that's arm'd with't needs not feare t'encounter The most severe tribunall. Though I am Guiltlesse to heaven, yet I shal appeare Foule to opinion wanting testimony; And th'act makes me the lawes; I am no more The subject of my conscience, which by judgement Must be determin'd. Can I not prevent it? Flight may procure my safety. 'Twill bring on A greater danger, and cause supposition That I am guilty by the circumstance Of mine owne feares. Within. Help, help, a rape. Villaine keep back. The. Horrors on both sides round me. Hath my crosse fortune found new instruments To draw more mischiefes on me!

Soone as my feares Have finisht their effects of trembling, And that my breath's recover'd, shalt know all. The. Monsieur stir not; I have imployment for you May win your pardon. Kick. Vid all mine art; but myne art vill be in mine eele anon; is faln already into me breeshes. Bri. What object's this? Alasse your Cosin Raven Wounded or dead? what hand hath done it? The. This; Justice made this her instrument. He was A villaine to me, and betrayd my life To all those dangers which I overcame By th'causes strength. And lastly his intents To murder me, have brought upon himself This punishment as due. Bri. Why dost not fly then? I'le beare thee company in all adversityes. Thy person being safe time may effect A pardon by some composition. If thou be tane, thou meet'st thy certain end Mingled with shame; and mine hath the same date: I'le not out live thee. The. Did you bid me fly To shun the end's before me? sure ther's difference Twixt meritorious acts, and acts of shame. I was but justice executioner. His crime deserv'd death, and he had fair triall By evidence: see here this pointlesse weapon; If providence had not ordain'd it so. As he so I had faln; but innocent. Should I then fly? and by my feares beget A worse suspition? No: I'le meet th'event. And though I now were circled with the terrors Of racks and tortures; gibets; executioners; And all the palsying apprehensions That ever made a malefactor tremble, Arm'd as I am, I would encounter all With a fixt confidence. Just causes never Did yet miscarry; or if any have 'Twas to the greater glory of the cause. And Monsieur 'tis your imposition To watch this corps, and give to passengers What answers you have wit or language for. Bri. Wilt thou not fly then? prethee do not rashly Play away safety. The. If I fly, and so Provide for't, will you with me? Bri. Even to death, In that 'shalt find me resolute. I'le vy Against thy courage with my constancy. The. Let's go then Exeunt. Kick. Me be glad you be gon, for me will no stay long vid de dead man. If de live jentelvmanly soâbut me sall see vat you have in your pocket. Kick-shaw searching Ravens pocket he stirrs. Rav. Oh? a surgeon. Kick. De man be no dead: but me sall make you dead rader den go vidout your money. Kick. offers to take the sword from Raven and he riseth. Rav. What wilt thou villaine? 'Tis time then to leave off counterfeting Kick. Dis be de jentelman hire me to vark at de vedding; but he no know me, and day be sure de jentelman an de jenteluman dat run avay togeder. Rav. I'm wounded, but I hope not mortally; I have no feeling of those accidents Are deaths forerunners. Would I had a surgeon. If I survive, I will convert this mischiefe Into a benefit; and by his flight Possesse my self as well of what I covet, As by his death. Sir you can witnesse for me How and by whom I did recieve this wound. Although you know him not, make a description. Kick. Pardon me Monsieur; me no see him do it. Rav. You must dispense with scruple If you will serve my purposes a little, I can and will be thankfull; otherwise What e're you are I can betray your life For your intent of rape. Kick. Me be your servant Monsieur. Me do any ting; swear any ting; go to de divell along vid you rader den be hang. Rav. Go with me to a surgeon. The sixth Scene. To them Goodlove with three or foure servants. Good. We need make greater haste; 'tis almost night; The mist is risen much. Rav. My Uncles voyce. Help a surgeon: assist me now. Good. Looke about knaves: I have heard that voyce. 1 Ser. Here sir a man wounded. 2 Ser. 'Tis Master Raven. Good. My cosin Raven? what misfortune brought This ill upon him? hold that gentleman. Kick. Me no do it Monsieur: he be de yong jentelman in black, an de jenteluman. Good. What gentleman in black? Theophilus? Rav. My cosin sir? alasse; ther's so much goodnesse In him, I must not think he could be tempted To weare such guilt about him. Good sir have me Unto a surgeon; and that gentleman Shall give you satisfaction, ere you give Him a release. Kick. Now me sall be discover, and hang for teefe. 1 Ser. Wee'l carry him to one Hortens' house, and fetch a surgeon thither: 'tis close by. Good. One call my friend justice Ferret; and post you over to Mistris Brides father: his presence at the examination of these circumstances will be needfull. 'Till truth satisfies my desires I am in torment. Rav. I have a new designe. Good. And till I see Theophilus. Rav. Which I hope ne're will be. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fifth Act. The first Scene. Goodlove, Ferret, Mr s. Ferret, and Horten. Good. Sir we are troublesome: the accident Hath made a subject for your charity As well as for your art; and neither shall Be unrewarded. But may I presume Hee'l need no other surgeon? Hor. Doubt it not sir. The wound's but slight; were it more dangerous, The simples that I have apply'd would cure it Acording to the first intention As surgeons call it. M. Fer. Truly sir my neighbour is very skilfull; he cured my little shock of the mange so perfectly, that it hath fam'd him through the neighbourhood for an excellent dog-leech. Hor. I ow much to your commendation Mr s Ferret. M. Fe. Truly neighbour 'tis not so much worth. Good. I dare be sworne it is not. I dare not with much confidence rely Upon this mans endeavours. Would I had A surgeon here, whose judgement and experience Might give me further satisfaction. Is the French gentleman dispos'd of safely? Hor. I have confin'd him to a chamber sir, A too delightfull prison. He may feast His eyes with rarities. Good. I think you are Owner of more then all the towne besides. Hor. 'Tis my affected riches. Good. I have some You shall command sir. Hor. I'le have gratitude, And something to exchange. This accident May bring me in a purchase. M. Fe. Pray' neighbour let's see the late giants boot, and the dwarfes shoe. Good. Prettie extremes no doubt. M. Fe. Extremes sir! me thinks their differences should make a very good meane. Suppose the one was a great drinker or wencher; the other must needs be a little one. What the one wasted in boots the other sav's in shoes. But I'le in to the wounded gentleman, and help to talke away his paine. Hor. By no meanes: sleepe would give him more ease, and prevent a distraction; which he seemes to occasion some feare of by his often digressions and interruptions of discourse. Good. Indeed sir I am troubled when I weigh The accident and circumstances of it. Nor can we urge him to give satisfaction With any positive truth, but all his answers Are carelesse and imperfect; many times The second contradicts the first: and then Hee'l name Theophilus, as if he were The mischiefes worker. But of all kind friends Your strange relations have begot most wonder. The roarers, and Theophilus brave act; My cosins not revealing my intents; The maide left with the Merchants, and the Monsieurs Stealing away, then found with my hurt kinsman, What to conclude from theseâ The second Scene. To them a Servant hastely. Hor. The news! what meanes your haste? Ser. Alasse sir you are rob'd. Hor. How's that? Ser. The French gallant sir which you lockt in the chamber, is run away with your Remoras and Torpedos skins; and we know not what besides. Hor. Persue him. I'd not loose those rarities For halfe my state. Alasse sir they are valuable 'Bove any thing I own besides. M. Fe. Hath Monsieur given you the slip as he gave us? He may chance be catcht in a halter for it. Good. Be patient sir, and with your best endeavor Restore my cosin to his former safety, I'le recompence your losse with things more valuable. I have large trees of corall, and Zibetas Both of strange form and colour; I expect Some living Ermines. Hor. Would I had them, they Should pacifie me quickly. Good. Sure that french man Is guilty of the fact: why should he fly else? If by your servants industry that Monsieur May be brought back againe, 'twill be of consequence. Something perhaps may be concluded from A strict examination of him. Hor. I'le employ all the servants I have about it. M. Fe. They shall have my husbands authority with them; wee'l make you a warrant. Exeunt. Good. rema. Good. How various are th'events that may depend Upon one action, yet the end propos'd Not follow the intention! Accidents Will interpose themselves; like those rash men That thrust into a throng occasioned By some tumultuous difference, where perhaps Their busie curiosity begets New quarrells with new issues. I go on From one consideration to another, Yet can determin nothing. The third Scene. To him Father, Mother and Servant. Your arrivall Will be of use sir. Fat. Else my paines were fruitlesse. Chance brought us hither, for what ends I know not. But understanding you were here, I come To aske a daughter from you. Good. I from you Must have a wounded reputation cur'd, It bleeds worse then my kinsman, whom your sonne And daughter are by circumstance suspected To have attempted. Fat. My sonne sayd you sir? I heare that sonne of mine must be your heire; And I have heard what plots and circumventions You us'd to catch me: so you have sir finely. My states mine owne still, though my daughter's lost. Good. And pray' sir keep it; doubt not but 'twill find Some gratefull heire, that will preserve the memory Of such a benefit, with witty libells Upon your glorious life. Fat. Your scorn is well sir; And well becomes that supercilious gravity, Hath aw'd the citty long, and frighted Rats Into the Counter. Good. You are very free sir. Yet these are not the Cittyes liberties. Stand not too much upon your priviledge. If you can give faire satisfaction For what concernes you, doe; and let not passion Kindle a new flame. I am calme; have quencht My spleene that late was fired. Fat. I acknowledge I heare your kinsman's wounded, and there is A supposition by my daughters sweet heart. But how farre this concernes me, be your selfe The judge. Sir I have suffer'd in my fame already Too much, to have more added by suspition Of being accessary to an act Of such vile nature; and your self may sooner Prove guilty, if the circumstance be weigh'd You have made him your heire. Good. My intention Had done it; neither did it want the forme Of law for confirmation: but 'twas when I was too partiall in affection: now I am resolv'd to satisfie that error With severe justice. Fat. You'l revoke your act! Good. Hands stain'd with bloud shall never have the power To make a distribution of that wealth Heaven hath blest my faire endeavours with. Should he be prov'd a murderer (for though My cosin dye not, his intent was such) Revenge would waite on all his actions; And even his charity when he gave almes Would to his conscience so present the fact In bloudy characters, that his best deeds Would loose their merit. Fat. I am hard put to it. But sir suppose your kinsman did attempt Some practice upon him; ther's circumstance To make it probable. Suppose your cosin Repining at it that you should preferre Adoption before naturall succession, Assaulted him first to remove him, who Defending so himselfe made the act lawfull. Good. From your suppose I raise a supposition, That he to cleere himselfe of after troubles Which might arise by any kinsmans claime, Attempted this prevention by some others If not himselfe: which yet we cannot urge My kinsman to discover. Fat. There are plots In these proceedings. Might I sir be witnesse To an examination of your kinsman? The knowledge of the truth is of some consequence And doth concerne us. Good. If he may endure Discourse without his danger. The fourth Scene To them Servant, Plaster, and then Ferret, Mr s. Ferret, and Horten. Serv. Her's M r. Plaster, the learned Surgeon, that speakes nothing but Latine, because either he would not be understood, or not contradicted. Good. He is welcome. Hor. There is no need sir of his trouble: the gentleman is past danger. Plast. Are you a surgeon sir? M. Fe. A simple one sir; one I meane that useth no compounds. Plas. If you are rationall as well as empericall, and that you practice secundum artem 'tis well. Hor. I dare secure his safety. You may erre sir. He hath a wound; and where there is continuitatis divortium, you must consider whether it came per contusionem, punctionem, or how; and whether a nerve, tendon, ligament or artery be in danger. The parts likewise whether it be in principalibus vel minus principalibus. Then the adjuncts; whether there be fractura or dislocatio; for these make it vulnus compositum. Then the accidents; whether there be inflammatio ochimosis orâ Good. Pray sir what is that? Plas. It is sir copiosa sanguinis inter cutem diffusio; which many times causeth a dangerous apostema Good. You have satisfied very well sir. Plas. Perhaps you have applyed some Montebankes medicine which you believe will cure secundum primam intentionem. Good. Pray' sir how is that? Plas. That is sine suppuratione vel cicatrice. We that worke according to art begin with alteratione substantiÃ¦ in pus: for ex corruptione unius fit generatio alterius. And thenâ Good. You have said enough sir more then we understand. Pray' sir give him leave to see my cosin and his wound: his judgment being a professor may confirme us. The fifth Scene. To them Raven. Hor. He is here sir. Rav. The Brides Father and a surgeon! what new devise is towards? Fat. and Serv. whisper. Hor. I'le apply but one Emplastrum consolidans more: I think that's a terme of art. Exit. ser. Plas. I come not to be jeer'd. Good. To be rewarded; accept of this sir. gives him mony. Plas. My thankfullnesse. This is more then my practice would have deserv'd; for to say truth though I can out face it with talking, though I am neither parson nor vicar yet my cures serve to mayntaine sextons. I take my leave sir. Exit. Hor. The wound was very slight sir. M. Fe. Indeed Mr. Raven you escapt a scouring in your belly: if you had miscarried, the Monsieur for all the seperation betwixt his doublet and breeches should have trust for't, but that he is run away. Rav. Escap't I'm glad of that: it shall be usefull. Good. Being past danger cosin, we would gladly Be satisfied who 'twas that did attempt This mischiefe on you: you have hitherto Seem'd as unwilling he should be discover'd. If 'twere Theophilus, all diligence Shall be employ'd to find him, that he may Pay law her due: his flight makes it suspitious. Rav. Good sir forbeare that trouble. If he be fled with his faire Mistresse, 'tis A discreet policy to shun the danger, Her parents anger might bring on him. 'Twas The French man wounded me. Good. On what occasion? Rav. None sir that I know: I provok't him not; Unlesse he meant to rob me. Fat. Will you sir Justifie this on oath? Fathers Servant returnes. Rav. Were there necessity: 'Tis otherwise sufficient I have said it. Fat. Bring in the Monsieur. Hor. How sir! is he taken! Fat. Yes sir; with many trinckets that were yours. Hor. I am restor'd to my first state. Fat. We met him: Aud for some reason you shall know anon Brought him back with us. Rav. I am still discover'd. The sixth Scene. To them Kick-shaw. Fat. 'Tis needfull sir this man should be committed, That being accus'd he may be soone produc't Upon occasion. Kick. Me have no for to kill de man: de teefes have mine, True; me take de jenteluman from de dushman and de Spaniard: me offer too to kisse de jenteluman; an de yongjentelman in black dat hurt de man, almost kill me but dat me beg pardon. Rav. I have lighted upon it. Unto you all I do submit my selfe, And what I shall discover. I confesse I may seem not to merit a beliefe That have already feign'd so many untruths: But the officiousnesse of them consider'd I hope you'l credit this. It was my cosin Theophilus, that hurt me: But I know not Whether 'twere chance or malice for this gentleman Attempting rape upon your daughter sir, I drew a pointlesse weapon I had got; My cosins suddaine apprehention Perhaps mad him suspect me: and not knowing I meant a rescue of the gentlewoman (Whose voice I heard, but could not through the mist Discern her person) made his rash hand wound me; Which for his sake I joy is not prov'd morrall, Nor will I hope. Fat. I doe beleeve all this For certaine truth. But why should you accuse Another then? Rav. I did presume this man Unknowne to any here was fled, nor would Returne to take a punishment: and being A stranger was not capable of shame. Now my concealing who the actor was Neither his danger nor disgrace would follow. God. Nephew I do admire thy love to him So ill deserves it, and I now consider What an injustice my election was. Henceforth thou art mine heire. I will employ A numerous search to find him that he may Be punisht for his fact. Rav. By no meanes sir: Call him not back; my wound may yet have danger; And if he should returne to pay his life For mine that's so unworthyâ Fat. But he shall To make you give the law a satisfaction For all your villanies. Come forth my sonne, For so he is sir. The last Scene. To them Theophilus and Bride. Theo. Humbly thus I beg Theo. kneeles Your pardon sir Good. Pray' aske your father blessing: Y'have got one now. Fat. He hath sir, and shall keep him His faire desert won my conversion; And chang'd me from intents of punishing To an indulgent favourer. This hath been A villaine to his life, and to his fortunes; Whetted by envy to such practises As merrit death when you shall heare the passages. A man that's guilty; that from foule intents Proceeded to an act would flye for safety: Instead of which Theophilus repair'd To me, that then was laboring with revenge. First offers restitution of my daughter; Then passing on from declaration To declaration, made to confident By his sweet innocence, he satisfi'd Mine anger, and gave peace unto my passions Nor was I patient to defer their joyes (Which likewise are myne own but got them married This evening with a dispensation for it Before we came to you. Where by the way We met this Monsieur, and enforc't him back: Whom straight his feares betrayd to a discovery Of what he was; no gentleman, but Kick-shaw In's wenching clothes. Ser. Monsieur Kick-shaw: we want plate Monsieur. Kick. Now me sall be hang agen. Hor. And I want Jewells Monsieur. Kick. Jewells! me have noting but two tree bable. Pray' vat be dis? Puls the things out of his pockets. Hor. A bable call you it? This gentlemen is the horne of an Ãthiopian Rhinoceros. Kick. An dis! Hor. The Taleon of a Birde in terra australi incognita, which the inhabitants call their great god Ruc, that preyes upon Elephants, and will not be gorged under two or three in a morning This stone of a strange forme and colour was brought by the learned traveller of Odcombe from the great Mogull. M. Fe. How sir! One of the great mogul's stones, Fat. Good sir forbeare a little. Now he's mine I'le own him and the rather if you will Disclaime all interest in him. For your kinsman Some wise and powerfull authority Must force truth from him. M. Fe. My husbands authority sir is both wise and powerfull Rav. 'Tis not in all my stock of cunning now To hold out longer. Shame will be the end Of all my undertakings. Good. Cosin your looks are strange, and seeme as if They would betray your thoughts. If you have guilt, Let it not presse your conscience with a weight Will sinck it into horror. Rav. I have much sir. Nor will there need another testimony For confirmation of what I shall utter. He that with griefe doth publish his own shame, Speakes from truths records. Good. What may this preface meane? Rav. You had a sonne, whose birth depriv'd his mother Of life; and what bestow'd a joy upon you Rob'd you of one. Good. Why dost review a griefe Time had worne out? Indeed I had a sonne. Rav. And have him still: enjoy him in Theophilus. The. Was this the knowledge of my selfe he spake of, That liv'd but in him selfe? Good. I feare his wound, And a distraction. Rav. Heare me sir and then You will have faith. The child you did dispose To be nurst by my mother, I being then An infant likewise. She knowing by law That I was capable of your estate Your heire being once remov'd, soone plots To make the childe away; attemps, but fainting In th'execution left it in the feilds; A formall buriall strengthning the report That it was dead. By providence directed You found and bred it up, and this is he. My dying mother did reveale it to me With teares of penitence, and an injunction I should discover it: which my avarice And envy would not suffer me, but tempted My soule to those black practices, which now Cease with my shame and my repentance. Good. Joyes Good, embraceth Theo. kneeling. Have fill'd me to the danger of a surfet. Welcome to life; I have a new begot thee. How often have I wisht in these embraces The thing I did embrace but knew it not. Cosin I hope your sorrow is not feign'd That it may merrit pardon, and preserve me A loving Uncle. The. I forgive you Cosin, You have at length in this discovery Given large satisfaction. Rav. I'le remove All cause of after jealousy. Fat. We by these Good. and Fat. embrace. Are reconciled for ever. M. Fe. But her's dilinquent must be punished. Good. He shall be pardon'd too upon condition He will no more play the impostor thus, To weare the habit of a gentleman Having such vile conditions; o disgracing His noble nation; making all suspected. I'le likewise adde something unto your storehouse. And though 'tis late lets have a wedding feast: To which pray' welcome every loving guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue by the Bride. I am a Mayden yet, how can I then Without some feare and blushes speake to men? Ladyes and gentlewomen pray' stick to me If the rude men should offer to undo me. Would they be kinde, and say I have done well I'd give them leave to clap me.
