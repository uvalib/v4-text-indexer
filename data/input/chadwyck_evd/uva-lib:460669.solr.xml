      <field name="fulltext">ETHWALD: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS. PART FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. MEN Oswal, king of Mercia. Edward, his nephew, and ethling or heir to the crown. Seagurth, father to Edward. Ethwald. Ethelbert, a noble Thane. Selred, elder brother to Ethwald. Mollo, father to Ethwald, a Thane of small consideration. Hexulf, a bigoted bishop. Alwy, an artful adventurer. Woggarwolfe, a rude marauding Thane. Ongar, a creature of Alwy's. Mystics and Mystic Sisters, supposed to be successors of the Druidical diviners; soldiers, attendants, &amp;c. WOMEN Elburga, daughter to king Oswal. Bertha, attached to Ethwald. Sigurtha, mother to Bertha, and niece to Mollo, living in his castle, with her daughter, as part of his family. Dwina, attendant on Elburga. Ladies, attendants, and female Druids. The scene is supposed to be in England, in the kingdom of Mercia, and the time near the end of the Heptarchy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The court of a Saxon castle. Ethwald is discovered lying upon the ground as if half asleep. The sound of a horn is heard without, at which he raises his head a little, and lays it down again. The gate of the castle opens at the bottom of the stage, and enter Selred, Ethelbert, and attendants, as if returned from hunting. Sel. and Eth. walk forward to the front, and the others retire by different sides of the stage. Selred. This morning's sport hath bravely paid our toil. Have not my dogs done credit to their breed? Eth. I grant they have. Sel. Mark'd you that tawny hound, With stretched nostrils snuffing to the ground, Who still before, with animating yell, Like the brave leader of a warlike band, Through many a mazy track his comrades led Right in the tainted path? I would not for the weregild of a Thane That noble creature barter. Eth. I do not mean to tempt thee with the sum. Seest thou where Ethwald, like a cottage cur On dunghill stretch'd, half sleeping, half awake, Doth bask his lazy carcass in the sun? Ho! laggard there! [To Ethw., who just raises his head, and lays it down again. Eth. going up close to him. When slowly from the plains and nether woods, With all their winding streams and hamlets brown, Updrawn, the morning vapour lifts its veil, And through its fleecy folds, with soften'd rays, Like a still'd infant smiling in his tears, Looks through the early sun:—when from afar The gleaming lake betrays its wide expanse, And, lightly curling on the dewy air, The cottage smoke doth wind its path to heaven: When larks sing shrill, and village cocks do crow, And lows the heifer loosen'd from her stall: When heaven's soft breath plays on the woodman's brow, And every hare-bell and wild tangled flower Smells sweetly from its cage of checker'd dew: Ay, and when huntsmen wind the merry horn, And from its covert starts the fearful prey; Who, warm'd with youth's blood in his swelling veins, Would, like a lifeless clod, outstretched lie, Shut up from all the fair creation offers? (Ethw. yawns and heeds him not.) He heeds me not. Sel. I will assail him now. (In a louder voice.) Ho! heads of foxes deck our huntsman's belt, Which have through tangled woods and ferny moors With many wiles shaped out their mazy flight, Have swum deep floods, and from the rocky brows Of frightful precipices boldly leap'd Into the gulf below. Nay, e'en our lesser game hath nobly done; Across his shoulders hang four furred feet, That have full twenty miles before us run In little space. O, it was glorious! Ethw. (raising his head carelessly). Well well, I know that hares will swiftly run When dogs pursue them. (Stretches himself and goes to rest again.) Eth. Leave him to rest, he is not to be rous'd. Sel. Well, be it so. By heaven, my fretted soul Did something of this easy stupor lack, When near the latter limits of our chace I pass'd the frowning tower of Ruthergeld. He hangs a helmet o'er his battlements, As though he were the chief protecting Thane Of all the country round. I'll teach th' ennobled Ceorl, within these bounds, None may pretend in noble birth to vie With Mollo's honour'd line! Eth. (proudly). Hast thou forgot? Or didst thou never hear whose blood it is That fills these swelling veins? Sel. I cry you mercy, Thane: I little doubt Some brave man was the founder of your house. Eth. Yes, such an one, at mention of whose name The brave descendants of two hundred years Have stately ris'n with more majestic step, And proudly smiled. Sel. Who was this lordly chieftain? Eth. A Swabian shepherd's son, who, in dark times, When ruin dire menaced his native land, With all his native lordship in his grasp, A simple maple spear and osier shield, Making of keen and deep sagacity, With daring courage and exalted thoughts, A plain and native warrant of command, Around him gather'd all the valiant youth; And, after many a gallant enterprise, Repell'd the foe, and gave his country peace. His grateful country bless'd him for the gift, And offer'd to his worth the regal crown. Sel. (bowing respectfully). I yield me to thy claim. [Ethwald, who has raised himself up by degrees upon hearing the story, and listened eagerly, now starts up, impatient of the pause, and catches Eth. by the arm. Ethw. And did they crown him then? Eth. No; with a mind above all selfish wrong, He gen'rously the splendid gift refused: And drawing from his distant low retreat The only remnant of the royal race, Did fix him firmly on his father's seat; Proving until his very latest breath A true and loyal subject. [Ethwald's countenance changes, then turning from Eth. he slowly retires to the bottom of the stage and exit. Eth. follows him attentively with his eye as he retires. Eth. Mark'd you the changes of the stripling's eye? You do complain that he of late has grown A musing sluggard. Selred, mark me well: Brooding in secret, grows within his breast That which no kindred owns to sloth or ease. And is your father fix'd to keep him pent Still here at home? Doth the old wizard's prophecy, That the destruction of his noble line Should from the valour of his youngest son, In royal warfare, spring, still haunt his mind? This close confinement makes the pining youth More eager to be free. Sel. Nay, rather say, the lore he had from thee Hath o'er him cast this sullen gloom. Ere this, Where was the fiercest courser of our stalls That did not shortly under him become As gentle as the lamb? What bow so stiff But he would urge and strain his youthful strength, Till every sinew o'er his body rose, Like to the sooty forger's swelling arm, Until it bent to him? What flood so deep That on its foaming waves he would not throw His naked breast, and beat each curling surge, Until he gain'd the far opposing shore? But since he learnt from thee that letter'd art, Which only sacred priests were meant to know, See how it is, I pray! His father's house Has unto him become a cheerless den. His pleasant tales and sprightly playful talk, Which still our social meals were wont to cheer, Now visit us but like a hasty beam Between the showery clouds. Nay, e'en the maid My careful father destines for his bride, That he may still retain him here at home, Fair as she is, receives, when she appears, His cold and cheerless smile. Surely thy penanced pilgrimage to Rome, And the displeasure of our holy saint, Might well have taught thee that such sacred art Was good for priests alone. Thou'st spoilt the youth. Eth. I've spoilt the youth! What thinkst thou then of me? Sel. I'll not believe that thou at dead of night Unto dark spirits sayst unholy rhymes; Nor that the torch, on holy altars burnt, Sinks into smoth'ring smoke at thy approach; Nor that foul fiends about thy castle yell, What time the darken'd earth is rock'd with storms; Though many do such frightful credence hold, And sign themselves when thou dost cross their way. I'll not believe— Eth. By the bless'd light of heaven !— Sel. I cannot think— Eth. Nay, by this well-proved sword! Sel. Patience, good Thane! I meant to speak thy praise. Eth. My praise, sayst thou? Sel. Thy praise. I would have said, “That he who in the field so oft hath fought, So bravely fought, and still in the honour'd cause, Should hold unhallow'd league with damned sprites, I never will believe.” Yet much I grieve That thou with bold intrusive forwardness, Hast enter'd into that which holy men Hold sacred for themselves; And that thou hast, with little prudence too, Entrapp'd my brother with this wicked lore, Although methinks thou didst not mean him harm. Eth. I thank thee, Selred; listen now to me, And thou shalt hear a plain and simple tale, As true as it is artless. These cunning priests full loudly blast my fàme, Because that I with diligence and cost, Have had myself instructed how to read Our sacred Scriptures, which, they would maintain, No eye profane may dare to violate. If I am wrong, they have themselves to blame; It was their hard extortions first impell'd me To search that precious book, from which they draw Their right, as they pretend, to lord it thus. But what thinkst thou, my Selred, read I there? Of one sent down from heav'n in sov'reign pomp, To give into the hands of leagued priests All power to hold th' immortal soul of man In everlasting thraldom? O far otherwise! [Taking Selred 's hand with great earnestness. Of one who health restored unto the sick, Who made the lame to walk, the blind to see, Who fed the hungry, and who rais'd the dead, Yet had no place wherein to lay His head. Of one from ev'ry spot of tainting sin Holy and pure; and yet so lenient, That He with soft and unupbraiding love Did woo the wand'ring sinner from his ways, As doth the elder brother of a house The erring stripling guide. Of one, my friend, Wiser by far than all the sons of men, Yet teaching ignorance in simple speech, As thou wouldst take an infant on thy lap And lesson him with his own artless tale. Of one so mighty That He did say unto the raging sea “Be thou at peace,” and it obeyed His voice; Yet bow'd Himself unto the painful death That we might live.—They say that I am proud— O! had they like their gentle master been, I would, with suppliant knee bent to the ground, Have kiss'd their very feet. But, had they been like Him, they would have pardon'd me Ere yet my bending knee had touch'd the earth. Sel. Forbear, nor tempt me with thy moving words! I'm a plain soldier, and unfit to judge Of mysteries which but concern the learn'd. Eth. I know thou art, nor do I mean to tempt thee. But in thy younger brother I had mark'd A searching mind of freer exercise, Untrammell'd with the thoughts of other men: And like to one, who, in a gloomy night, Watching alone amidst a sleeping host, Sees suddenly along the darken'd sky Some beauteous meteor play, and with his hand Wakens a kindred sleeper by his side To see the glorious sight, e'en so did I. With pains and cost I divers books procured, Telling of wars, and arms, and famous men; Thinking it would his young attention rouse; Would combat best a learner's difficulty, And pave the way at length for better things. But here his seized soul has wrapp'd itself, And from the means is heedless of the end. If wrong I've done, I do repent me of it. And now, good Selred, as thou'st seen me fight Like a brave chief, and still in th' honour'd cause, By that good token kindly think of me, As of a man who long has suffered wrong Rather than one deserving so to suffer. Sel. I do, brave Ethelbert. Eth. I thank thee, friend. And now we'll go and wash us from this dust: We are not fit at goodly boards to sit. Is not your feast-hour near? Sel. I think it is. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A small apartment in Mollo 's castle. Enter Ethwald very thoughtful, who leans against a pillar for some time without speaking. Ethw. (coming forward). Is it delusion this? Or wears the mind of man within itself A conscious feeling of its destination? What say these suddenly imposed thoughts, Which mark such deepen'd traces on the brain Of vivid real persuasion, as do make My nerved foot tread firmer on the earth, And my dilating form tower on its way? That I am born, within these narrow walls, The younger brother of a petty chief, To live my term in dark obscurity, Until some foul disease or bloody gash, In low marauding strife, shall lay me low? My spirit sickens at the hateful thought, Which hangs upon it with such thick oppression, As doth the heavy, dense, sulphureous air Upon the breath it stifles. [Pulling up the sleeve of his garment, and baring his right arm from the shoulder. A firmer strung, a stronger arm than this Own'd ever valiant chief of ancient story? And lacks my soul within, what should impel it? Ah! but occasion, like th' unveiling moon Which calls the advent'rer forth, did shine on them! I sit i' the shade! no star-beam falls on me! [Bursts into tears, and throws himself back against the pillar. A pause; he then starts forward full of animation, and tosses his arms high as he speaks. No; storms are hush'd within their silent cave, And unflesh'd lions slumber in the den, But there doth come a time! Enter Bertha, stealing softly upon him before he is aware. What, Bertha, is it thou who stealst upon me? Ber. I heard thee loud: Conversest thou with spirits in the air? Ethw. With those whose answ'ring voice thou canst not hear. Ber. Thou hast of late the friend of such become, And only them. Thou art indeed so strange, Thy very dogs have ceas'd to follow thee, For thou no more their fawning court receiv'st, Nor callest to them with a master's voice. What art thou grown, since thou hast lov'd to pore Upon those magic books? Ethw. No matter what! a hermit an' thou wilt. Ber. Nay, rather, by thy high assumed gait And lofty mien, which I have mark'd of late, Ofttimes thou art, within thy mind's own world, Some king or mighty chief. If so it be, tell me thine honour's pitch, And I will cast my regal mantle on, And mate thy dignity. [Assuming much state. Ethw. Out on thy foolery! Ber. Dost thou remember How on our throne of turf, with birchen crowns And willow branches waving in our hands, We shook our careless feet, and caroll'd out, And call'd ourselves the king and queen of Kent? Ethw. Yes, children ever in their mimic play Such fairy state assume. Ber. And bearded men Do sometimes gild the dull unchanging face Of sombre stilly life with like conceits. Come, an' you will we'll go to play again. [Tripping gaily round him. Ethw. Who sent thee here to gambol round me thus? Ber. Nay, fie upon thee! for thou knowst right well It is an errand of my own good will. Knowest thou not the wand'ring clown is here, Who doth the osier wands and rushes weave Into all shapes: who chants gay stories too; And who was wont to tell thee, when a boy, Of all the bloody wars of furious Penda? E'en now he is at work before the gate, With heaps of pliant rushes round him strew'd; In which birds, dogs, and children roll and nestle, Whilst, crouching by his side, with watchful eye The playful kitten marks each trembling rush As he entwists his many cireling bands. Nay, men and matrons, too, around him flock, And Ethelbert, low seated on a stone, With arms thus cross'd, o'erlooks his curious craft. Wilt thou not come? Ethw. Away, I care not for it! Ber. Nay, do not shake thy head, for thou must come. This magic girdle will compel thy steps. [Throws a girdle round him playfully, and pulls it till it breaks. Ethw. (smiling coldly). Thou seest it cannot hold me. [Bertha's face changes immediately: she bursts into tears, and turns away to conceal it. Ethw. (soothing her). My gentle Bertha! little foolish maid! Why fall those tears? wilt thou not look on me? Dost thou not know I am a wayward man, Sullen by fits, but meaning no unkindness? Ber. O thou wert wont to make the hall rejoice; And cheer the gloomy face of dark December! Ethw. And will, perhaps, again. Cheer up, my love! (Assuming a cheerful voice.) And plies the wandering clown his pleasing craft, Whilst dogs and men and children round him flock? Come, let us join them too. [Holding out his hand to her, whilst she smiles through her tears. How course those glancing drops adown thy cheeks, Like to a whimp'ring child! fie on thee, Bertha! [Wipes off her tears, and leads her out affectionately. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A narrow stone gallery or passage. (Voice without.) Haste, lazy comrade, there! Enter two servants by opposite sides, one of them carrying mats of rushes in his arms. 1st serv. Setst thou thy feet thus softly to the ground,— As if thou hadst been paid to count thy steps? What made thee stay so long? 2d serv. Heard you the news? 1st serv. The news? 2d serv. Ay, by the mass! sharp news indeed. And mark me well! beforehand I have said it; Some of those spears now hanging in the hall Will wag i' the field ere long. 1st serv. Thou hast a marv'llous gift of prophecy. I know it well; but let us hear thy news. 2d serv. Marry! the Britons and their restless prince, Join'd with West Anglia's king, a goodly host, Are now in Mercia, threat'ning all with ruin. And over and besides, God save us all! They are but five leagues off. 'Tis true. And over and besides again, Our king is on his way to give them battle. Ay, and moreover all, if the late floods Have broken down the bridge, as it is fear'd He must perforce pass by our castle walls, And then thou shalt behold a goodly show! 1st serv. Who brought the tidings? 2d serv. A soldier sent on horseback, all express: E'en now I heard him tell it to the Thane, Who caution'd me to tell it unto none, That Ethwald might not hear it. 1st serv. And thou in sooth obeyst his caution well. Now hear thou this from me; thou art a lout; And over and besides a babbling fool; Ay, and moreover all, I'll break thy head If thou dost tell again, in any wise, The smallest tittle of it. 2d serv. Marry! I can be secret as thyself! I tell not those who blab. 1st serv. Yes, yes, thy caution is most scrupulous; Thou'lt whisper it in Ethwald's hither ear, And bid the further not to know of it. Give me those trusses. 2d serv. Yes, this is made for my old master's seat, And this, so soft, for gentle lady Bertha. (Giving the mats.) And this, and this, and this for Ethelbert. But see thou put a sprig of mountain-ash Beneath it snugly. Dost thou understand? 1st serv. What is thy meaning? 2d serv. It hath a power to cross all wicked spells; So that a man may sit next stool to th' devil, If he can lay but slily such a twig Beneath his seat, nor suffer any harm. 1st serv. I wish there were some herb of secret power To save from daily scath of blund'ring fools: I know beneath whose stool it should be press'd. Get thee along! the feast smokes in the hall. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Saxon hall, with the walls hung round with armour. Mollo, Ethelbert, Selred, Ethwald, Bertha, Sigurtha, and others, are discovered sitting round a table, on which stand goblets and flaggons &amp;c. after a feast. Eth. Nay, gentle Bertha, if thou followest him, Shear off those lovely tresses from thy head, And with a frowning helmet shade those eyes; E'en with thy prowess added to his own, Methinks he will not be surcharg'd of means To earn his brilliant fortune in the field. Ber. Nay, rather will I fill a little scrip With sick-men's drugs and salves for fest'ring wounds, And journey by his side a trav'lling leech. Sel. That will, indeed, no unmeet comrade be For one whose fortune must be earn'd with blows Borne by no substitutes. Ethw. Well jested, Thanes! But some, ere now, with fortune earn'd by blows Borne by no substitutes, have placed their mates Above the gorgeous dames of castled lords. Cheer up, sweet Bertha! For ev'ry drug ta'en from thy little scrip I'll pay thee back with— Eth. Sticks the word in his throat. Sel. It is too great for utt'rance. Eth. Here's to your growing honour, future chief; And here is to the lofty dame who shall be— [They all drink ironically to Ethw. and Berth. Mollo. (seriously). Here is a father's wish for thee, my son, (To Ethw.) Better than all the glare of fleeting greatness. Be thou at home the firm domestic prop Of thine old father's house, in this as honour'd As he who bears far hence advent'rous arms! Nor think thee thus debarr'd from warlike deeds: Our neighb'ring chiefs are not too peaceable, And much adventure breed in little space. Ethw. What! shall I in their low destructive strife Put forth my strength, and earn with valiant deeds The fair renown of mighty Woggarwolfe, The flower of all those heroes? Hateful ruffian! He drinks men's blood and human flesh devours! For scarce a heifer on his pasture feeds Which hath not cost a gallant warrior's life. I cry you mercy, father! you are kind, But I do lack the grace to thank you for it. [Mollo leans on the table and looks sad. Sigur. (to Mol.) Good uncle, you are sad! Our gen'rous Ethwald Contemns not his domestic station here, Though little willing to enrich your walls With spoils of petty war. Ethw. (seeing his father sad, and assuming cheerfulness). Nay, father, if your heart is set on spoil, Let it be Woggarwolfe's that you shall covet, And small persuasion may suffice to tempt me. To plunder him will be no common gain. We feasters love the flesh of well-run game: And, faith! the meanest beeves of all his herds Have hoof'd it o'er as many weary miles, With goading pike-men hollaing at their heels, As e'er the bravest antler of the woods. His very sheep too all are noble beasts, For which contending warriors have fought; And thrifty dames will find their fleece enrich'd With the productions of full many a soil. Ber. How so, my Ethwald? Ethw. Countest thou for nought Furze from the upland moors, and bearded down Torn from the thistles of the sandy plain, The sharp-tooth'd bramble of the shaggy woods And tufted seeds from the dark marsh? Good sooth; She well may triumph in no vulgar skill Who spins a coat from it. And then his wardrobe, too, of costly gear, Which from the wallets of a hundred thieves. Has been transferring for a score of years, In endless change, it will be noble spoil! [A trumpet is heard without, and Ethw. starts from his seat. Ha! 'tis the trumpet's voice! What royal leader this way shapes his route? [A silent pause. Ye answer not. and yet ye seem to know. Enter Servants in haste. Good fellows, what say ye? 1st serv. The king! the king! and with five thousand men! 2d serv. I saw his banners from the battlements Waving between the woods. 3d serv. And so did I. His spearmen onward move in dusky lines, Like the brown reeds that skirt the winter pool. Sel. Well, well, there needs not all this wond'ring din: He passes on, and we shall do our part. 1st serv. The foe is three leagues off. Sel. Hold thy fool's tongue! I want no information. [Ethwald remains for a while thoughtful, then running eagerly to the end of the hall, climbs up and snatches from the walls a sword and shield, with which he is about to run out. Mollo (tottering from his seat). O go not forth, my rash impetuous son! Say yet a term beneath thy father's root, And, were it at the cost of half my lands, I'll send thee out accoutred like a Thane. Ethw. No, reverend sire, these be my patrimony! I ask of thee no more. Ber. And wilt thou leave us? Mollo. Ay, he'll break thy heart, And lay me in the dust! [Trumpet sounds again, and Ethw. turning hastily from them, runs out. Ber. Oh! he is gone for ever! Eth. Patience, sweet Bertha! Sd. The castle gates are shut by my command, He cannot now escape. Holla, good friends! [To those without. Enter Followers. All quickly arm yourselves, and be prepared To follow me before the fall of eve. Eth. Send out my scout to climb the farther hill, And spy if that my bands are yet in sight. [Exeunt followers. Now let us try to tame this lion's whelp. Enter Servant in haste. Sel. What tidings, man? Is Ethwald at the gate? Ser. No, good my lord, nor yet within the walls. Sel. What, have they open'd to him? Ser. No, my lord, Loudly he call'd, but when it was refus'd, With glaring eyes, like an enchafed wolf, He hied him where the lowest southern wall Rises but little o'er the rugged rock; There, aided by a half-projecting stone, He scal'd its height, and holding o'er his head His sword and shield, grasp'd in his better hand, Swam the full moat. Eth. (to Sel.) O, noble youth! Did I not say, you might as well arrest The fire of heav'n within its pitchy cloud As keep him here? [Bertha faints away. Alas, poor maid! [Whilst Sigurtha and Eth. &amp;c. attend to Bertha, enter followers and retainers, and begin to take down the armour from the walls. Enter Woggarwolfe. Wog. (to Sel.) They would have shut your gate upon me now, But I, commission'd on the king's affairs, Commanded entrance. Oswal greets you, chiefs, And gives you orders, with your followers, To join him speedily. (Seeing Bertha.) What, swooning women here? Sel. Ethwald is gone in spite of all our care, And she, thou knowst, my father's niece's child, Brought up with him from early infancy. Is therein much affected. Wog. (smiling). O, it is ever thus, I know it well, When striplings are concern'd! Once on a time. A youthful chief I seiz'd in his own hall, When, on the instant, was the floor around With fainting maids and shrieking matrons strew'd, As though the end of all things had been link'd Unto my fatal grasp. Sel. (eagerly). Thou didst not slay him? Wog. (smiling contemptuously). Asks Selred if I slew mine enemy? Sel. Then, by heav'n's light, it was a ruffian's deed! Wog. I cry thee grace! wearst thou a virgin sword? Maidens turn pale when they do look on blood, And men there be who sicken at the sight, If men they may be call'd. Sel. Ay, men there be, Who sicken at the sight of crimson butchery, Yet in the battle's heat will far out-dare A thousand shedders of unkindled blood. Eth. (coming forward). Peace, Thanes! this is no time for angry words. [Bertha giving a deep sigh, Eth. and Sel. go to her and leave Wog., who heeds her not, but looks at the men taking the arms from the walls.—Observing one who hesitates between the swords. Wog. Fool, choose the other blade! That weight of steel will noble gashes make! Nay, rightly guided in a hand like thine, Might cleave a man down to the nether ribs. Sig. (to Bertha, as she is recovering). My gentle child, how art thou? Ber. And no kind hand to hold him! Eth. Be not cast down, sweet maid; he'll soon return; All are not lost who join in chanceful war. Ber. I know right well, good Thane, all are not lost. The native children of rude jarring war, Full oft returning from the field, become Beneath their shading helmets aged men: But, ah! the kind, the playful, and the gay; They who have gladden'd their domestic board, And cheer'd the winter-fire, do they return? [Shaking her head sorrowfully. I grieve you all: I will no more complain. Dear mother, lead me hence. (To Sig.) (To Sel.) I thank you, gentle Selred, this suffices. [Exit Bertha, supported by Sigurtha. Sel. (to Mollo, who has sat for some time with his face covered). What, so o'ercome, my father? Moll. I am o'ercome, my son! lend me thine arm. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A forest: the view of an abbey with its spires in the background. Enter the King, attended by Seagurth and several Thanes and followers, some of them wounded, and their wounds bound up, as after a battle. A flourish of trumpets: the King stretches out his arm in the action of command; the trumpets cease, and they all halt. King. Companions of this rough and bloody day, Beneath the kindly shelter of this wood Awhile repose, until our eager youth Shall, from the widely spread pursuit return'd, Rejoin our standards. Brave seneschal, thou'rt weak with loss of blood; Forbear attendance. Ay, and thou, good Baldrick; And thou (to another), and all of you. Sen. No, gracious king; The sight of you, unhurt, doth make the blood That in our veins is left so kindly glow, We cannot faint. King. Thanks, noble chiefs! dear is the gain I earn, Purchas'd with blood so precious. Who are those Who hitherward in long procession move? Sen. It is the pious brethren, as I guess, Come forth to meet you from yon neighb'ring abbey, And at their head the holy Hexulf comes. Enter Hexulf and monks. Hex. Accept our humble greetings, royal sire! Victorious be your arms! and in the dust Low be your foes, as in this glorious day! Favour'd of heav'n, and of St. Alban, hail! King. I thank your kindly zeal, my rev'rend father; And from these holy brethren do accept With thanks this token of good will, not doubting That much I am beholden to your prayers. Hex. In truth, most gracious king, your armed host Has not more surely in your cause prevail'd Than hath our joint petition, offered up With holy fervour, most importunate. Soon as the heav'n-rais'd voices sweetly reach'd The echoing arches of yon sacred roofs, Saint Alban heard, and to your favour'd side Courage and strength, the soul of battle, sent; Fear and distraction to th' opposing foe. King. Ah, then, good father, and ye pious monks, Would that ye had begun your prayers the sooner! For long in doubtful scales the battle hung; And of the men who, with this morning's sun, Buckled their harness on to follow me, Full many a valiant warrior, on his back Lies stiff'ning to the wind. Hex. The wicked sprite in ev'ry armed host Will find his friends; who doubtless for a time May counterpoise the prayers of holy men. There are among your troops, I question not, Many who do our sacred rites contemn: Many who have blasphem'd—Ay, good my lord; And many holding baleful heresies. Fought Ethelbert, of Sexford, in your host? King. He did, my rev'rend father, bravely fought: To him and valiant Selred, Mollo's son, Belong the second honours of the day. [Hexulf looks abashed and is silent. Enter Edward attended, who, after making his obeisance to the King, runs up eagerly to Seagurth. Edw. You are not wounded, father? Sea. No, my boy. Edw. Thanks to preserving goodness! Noble Thanes, It grieves me much to see those swathed limbs. War wears a horrid, yet alluring face. (To King.) Your friends, my lord, have done me great despite. Had they not long detain'd me on the way, I should have been with you before the battle. King. Complain not, youth; they had, in this, commands Too high to be disputed. And 'tis well, For we have had a rough and bloody day. Edw. Ha! is it so? But you have been victorious. How went the field? Sea. Loud rose our battle's sound, and for a while The Mercians bravely fought; when all at once, From some unlook'd-for cause, as yet unknown, A powerful panic seiz'd our better wing, Which, back recoiling, turn'd and basely fled. Touch'd quickly with a seeming sympathy, Our centre-force began, in relax'd strength, To yield contended space.—So stood the field; When on a sudden, like those warrior spirits, Whose scatter'd locks the streamy light'ning is, Whose spear the bolt of heaven; such as the seer In 'tranced gaze beholds midst hurtling storms; Rush'd forth a youth unknown, and in a pass, Narrow and steep, took his determin'd stand. His beck'ning hand and loud commanding voice Constrain'd our flying soldiers from behind, And the sharp point of his opposing spear Met the pale rout before. The dark returning battle thicken'd round him. His mighty arm deeds of amazement wrought; Rapid, resistless, terrible. High rose each warlike bosom at the sight, And Mercia, like a broad increasing wave, Up swell'd into a hugely billow'd height, O'erwhelming in its might all lesser things, Upon the foe return'd. Selred and Ethelbert Fell on their weaken'd flank. Confusion, then, And rout and horrid slaughter fill'd the field: Wide spread the keen pursuit; the day is ours; Yet many a noble Mercian strews the plain. Edw. (eagerly). But the young hero fell not? Sea. No, my son. Edw. Then bless'd be heaven! there beats no noble heart Which shall not henceforth love him as a brother. Would he were come unhurt from the pursuit! O that I had beheld him in his might, When the dark battle turn'd! Sea. Your wish is soon fulfill'd, my eager boy; For here, in truth, the youthful warrior comes, And, captive by his side, the British Prince. Enter Ethwald with the British Prince prisoner, accompanied by Selred and Ethelbert, and presents his prisoner to the King. King (to Prince). Prince of the Britons, clear thy cloudy brow; The varied fate of war the bravest prove. And though I might complain that thy aggressions Have burnt my towns, and filled my land with blood, Thy state forbids it. Here, good seneschal, Receive your charge, and let him know no change Unsuited to a prince. (To Ethwald.) And thou, brave warrior, whose youthful arm Has brought unto thy king so high a gift, Say what proud man may lift his honour'd head, And boast he is thy father. Ethw. A Thane, my lord, forgotten and retired; I am the youngest son of aged Mollo, And Ethwald is my name. King. Youngest in years, though not in honour, youth, E'en though the valiant Selred is thy brother. (Turning to Selred.) And now be thou the first and noble root, From which a noble race shall take its growth, Wearing thy honours proudly! Of Mairnieth's earldom be henceforth the lord! For well I know the council of the states Will not refuse to ratify my grant. And thou, brave Ethelbert, and Selred, too, Ye well have earn'd a noble recompense, And shall not be forgot. Come hither, Edward; Take thou this hero's hand; and, noble Ethwald, Thus let the kingdom's ethling join with me In honouring thy worth. Edw. (who has gazed at some distance upon Ethwald, springing forward eagerly). Give him my hand, my lord! have you not said That I should fold him to my burning heart? (Embraces Ethw.) Most valiant Ethwald, Fain would I speak the thoughts I bear to thee, But they do choke and flutter in my throat, And make me like a child. (Passing his hand across his eyes.) Ethw. (kissing Edward's hand). I am repaid beyond a kingdom's worth. Edw. (to Sea. bounding joyfully). Father, have you embraced him? Ethwald, my father is a valiant man. (Sea. embraces Ethw., but not so eagerly as Edw.) King. (to Ethw.) Brave youth, with you, and with your noble friends, I shall, ere long, have further conference. (Retires to the bottom of the stage with Hexulf.) [Edward, after gazing with admiration upon Ethw., puts his hand upon his head, as if to measure his height; then upon both his shoulders, as if he were considering the breadth of his chest; then steps some paces back and gazes at him again. Edw. How tall and strong thou art! broad is thy chest: Stretch forth, I pray, that arm of mighty deeds. Ethw. smiles and stretches out his arm; Edw. looks at it, and then at his own. Would I were nerv'd like thee! (Taking Ethw.'s sword.) It is of weight to suit no vulgar arm. (Returning it.) There, hero; graceful is the sword of war In its bold master's grasp. Ethw. Nay, good my lord, if you will honour me, It does become too well your noble hand To be return'd to mine. Edw. Ha! sayst thou so? Yes, I will keep thy pledge. Perhaps my arm—Ah, no! it will not be! But what returning token can I give? I have bright spears and shields and shining blades But nought ennobled by the owner's use. [Takes a bracelet from his arm and fastens it round Ethwald's. King (advancing from the bottom of the stage). My worthy chiefs and Thanes, the night wears on, The rev'rend bishop, and these pious men, Beneath their fane give hospitality, And woo us to accept it for the night. Sea. I thought, my lord, you meant to pass the night With your brave soldiers in the open field: Already they have learnt the pleasing tale. Shall I unsay it? King. Nay, that were unfit. I pray you pardon me, my rev'rend father! I cannot house with you; it were unfit. Hex. Should not your greatness spend the night with those To whom, in truth, you owe the victory? We chant at midnight to St. Alban's praise: Surely my lord regards those sacred things. [Whispers the King. King. Brave Seagurth, there are reasons of good weight Why I should lay aside my first intent. Let all these wounded chieftains follow me! The rest who list may keep the open field. (To Edw.) Nephew, thou must not prove a soldier's hardships, Ere thou hast earn'd a soldier's name. Nay, nay, It must be so. [Exeunt King, wounded chiefs, Hexulf, and monks, followed by Edward very unwillingly. Sea. Who loves a soldier's pillow, follow me. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The outside of Mollo's castle. Bertha, Sigurtha, and others discovered on the walls, and several servants and retainers standing by the gate below. Berth. O, will they ne'er appear? I'll look no more; Mine eager gazing but retards their coming. [Retires, and immediately returns again. Holla, good Murdoch! (To a servant below.) Thou putst thy hand above thy sunned eyes. Dost thou descry them? 1st serv. Mercy, gentle lady, If you descry them not from that high perch, How should I from my level station here? Sig. (to Berth.) Go in, my child, thou art worn out with watching. [Berth. retires, and 2d servant goes at some distance from the walls and looks out another way. 2d serv. Here comes the noble Selred. (All call out.) Noble Selred! Berth. (returning upon the wall). What, Ethwald, say ye? Sig. No, it is Selred. Enter Selred, with followers, and looks up to the walls, where Sigurtha waves her hand. Sig. Welcome, brave Selred! welcome all thy band! How far are they behind for whom we watch? Sel. Two little miles or less. Methinks ere this Their van should be in sight. My messenger Inform'd you? Sig. Oh, he did! Sel. Where is my father? Sig. He rests within, spent with a fearful joy, And silent tears steal down his furrow'd cheeks. Sel. I must confer with him. The king intends To stop and do him honour on his march, But enters not our walls. [Exeunt into the castle. SCENE III. A chamber in the castle. Enter Sigurtha and Bertha, speaking as they enter. Berth. Nay, mother, say not so: was he not wont, If but returning from the daily chase, To send an upward glance unto that tower? There well he knew, or late or cold the hour, His eye should find me. Sig. My gentle Bertha, be not thus disturb'd. Such busy scenes, such new unlook'd-for things Ruffle the flowing stream of habit; men Will then forgetful seem, though not unkind. Berth. Thinkst thou? (shaking her head.) I saw him by his sovereign stand, And O, how graceful! every eye to him Was turn'd, and every face smil'd honours on him! Yet his proud station quickly did he leave To greet his humbler friends who stood aloof. The meanest follower of these walls, already, Some mark of kind acknowledgment hath had— He look'd not up—I am alone forgotten! Sig. Be patient, child: he will not long delay To seek thee in thy modest privacy; Approving more to see thee here retired, Than, boldly to the army's eye exposed, Greeting his first approach. I, the mean while, Intrusted am with orders from the Thane. Which must not be neglected. [Exit. Berth. (after walking up and down, agitated, and frequently stopping to listen). Ah, no! deceiv'd again! I need not listen! No bounding steps approach. [She sits down despondingly. Enter Ethwald behind, and steals softly up to her. Ethw. Bertha! Berth. (starting up). My Ethwald! [He holds out his arms to her joyfully, and she bursts into tears. Ethw. Thou dost not grieve that I am safe return'd? Berth. O no! I do not grieve, yet I must weep. Hast thou in truth been kind? I will not chide: I cannot do it now. Ethw. O, fie upon thee! like a wayward child: To look upon me thus! cheer up, my love. [He smiles upon her joyfully, and her countenance brightens. She then puts her hand upon his arm, and, stepping back a little space, surveys him with delight. Berth. Thou man of mighty deeds! Thou, whom the brave shall love and princes honour! Dost thou, in truth, return to me again, Mine own, my very Ethwald? Ethw. No, that were paltry; I return to thee A thousandfold the lover thou hast known me. I have of late been careless of thee, Bertha. The hopeless calm of dull obscurity, Like the thick vapours of a stagnant pool, Oppress'd my heart and smother'd kind affections; But now th' enlivening breeze of fortune wakes My torpid soul—When did I ever fold thee To such a warm and bounding heart as this? [Embraces her. The king has given to me Mairnieth's earldom— Nay, smile, my Bertha! Berth. So I do, my Ethwald. Ethw. The noble ethling greatly honours me With precious tokens; nay, the very soldiers Do rear their pointed weapons as I pass; As though it were to say, “there goes the man That we would cheerly follow.” Unto what end these fair beginnings point I know not—but of this I am assured, There is a course of honour lies before me, Be it with dangers, toil, or pain beset, Which I will boldly tread. Smiles not my love? Berth. I should, in truth; but how is this? methinks Thou ever lookst upon the things to come, I on the past. A great and honour'd man I know thou'lt be: but O, bethink thee, then, How once thou wert, within these happy walls, A little cheerful boy, with curly pate, Who led the infant Bertha by the hand, Storing her lap with ev'ry gaudy flower; With speckled eggs stolen from the hedgeling's nest, And berries from the tree; ay, think on this, And then I know thou'lt love me! [Trumpet sounds. Catching hold of him eagerly. Hearst thou that sound? The blessed saints preserve thee! Must thou depart so soon? Ethw. Yes, of necessity: reasons of weight Constrain the king, and I, new in his service, Must seem to follow him with willing steps. But go thou with me to the castle gate. We will not part until the latest moment. Berth. Yet stop, I pray, thou must receive my pledge. Seest thou this woven band of many dyes, Like to a mottled snake? its shiny woof Was whiten'd in the pearly dew of eve, Beneath the silver moon; its varied warp Was dyed with potent herbs, at midnight cull'd. It hath a wond'rous charm: the breast that wears it No change of soft affection ever knows. Eth. (receiving it with a smile). I'll wear it, Bertha. [Trumpet sounds. Hark! it calls me hence. Berth. O go not yet! here is another gift, This ring, enrich'd with stone of basilisk, Whenever press'd by the kind wearer's hand, Presents the giver's image to his mind. Wilt thou not wear it? Ethw. (receiving it). Yes, and press it too. Berth. And in this purse— [Taking out a purse Ethw. What! still another charm? [Laughing. Thou simple maid! Dost thou believe that witched gear like this Hath power a lover faithful to retain, More than thy gentle self? Berth. Nay, laugh, but wear them. Ethw. I will, my love, since thou wilt have it so. (Putting them in his breast.) Here are they lodged, and cursed be the hand That plucks them forth! And now receive my pledge. It is a jewel of no vulgar worth: (Ties it on her arm.) Wear it and think of me. But yet, belike, It must be steeped in some wizard's pot, Or have some mystic rhyming mutter'd o'er it, Ere it will serve the turn. Berth. (pressing the jewel on her arm). O no! right well I feel there is no need. Ethw. Come, let us go: we do not part, thou knowst, But at the castle gate. Cheer up, my Bertha! I'll soon return, and oft return again. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An apartment in a royal castle. Enter Ethwald and Alwy, speaking as they enter. Ethw. What, peace! peace, sayst thou, with these glorious arms, In conquest red, occasion bright'ning round us, And smiling victory, with beck'ning hand, Pointing to future fields of nobler strife, With richer honours crown'd? What, on the face Of such fair prospects draw the veil of peace! Cold blasting peace! The blackest fiend of hell Hath not a thought more dev'lish! Alwy. It is indeed a flat unpleasant tale For a young warrior's ear: but well hast thou Improv'd the little term of bold occasion; Short while thou wert but Mollo's younger son, Now art thou Mairnieth's lord. Ethw. And what is Mairnieth's lordship! I will own That, to my distant view, such state appear'd A point of fair and noble eminence; But now—what is it now? O! it is sunk Into a petty knoll! I am as one Who doth attempt some lofty mountain's height, And having gain'd what to the upcast eye The summit's point appear'd, astonish'd sees Its cloudy top, majestic and enlarged, Towering aloft, as distant as before. Alwy. Patience, brave Ethwald; ere thy locks be grey, Thy helmed head shall yet in battle tower, And fair occasion shape thee fair reward. Ethw. Ere that my locks be grey! the world ere now Hath crouch'd beneath a beardless youth. But I— I am as one who mounts to th' azure sky On the rude billow's back, soon sunk again: Like the loud thunder of th' upbreaking cloud, The terror of a moment. Fate perverse! 'Till now, war's frowning spirit, rous'd, was wont To urge with whirling lash his sable steeds, Nor slack his furious speed till the wide land From bound to bound beneath his axle shook. But soon as in my hand the virgin spear Had flesh'd its ruddy point, then is he turn'd Like a tired braggart to his caves of sloth. (Stamping on the ground.) Peace! cursed peace! Who will again unchain The grizly dog of war? Alwy. Meanst thou the British prince? Ethw. (eagerly). What sayst thou, Alwy? Alwy. I said not aught. Ethw. Nay, marry! but thou didst! And it has rais'd a thought within my mind. The British prince releas'd, would he not prove A dog of war, whose yell would soon be follow'd? Alwy. They do indeed full hard advantage take Of his captivity, and put upon him Conditions suited to his hapless state, More than his princely will. Ethw. 'Tis basely done: would that some friendly hand His prison would unbar and free the thrall! But no, no, no! I to the king resign'd him; 'Twere an unworthy deed. Alwy. It were most difficult; For now they keep him in a closer hold, And bind his hands with iron. Ethw. Have they done this? I'm glad on't! O I'm glad on't! They promised nought unworthy of a prince To put upon him—Now my hands are free! And, were it made of living adamant, I will unbar his door. Difficult, sayst thou? No, this hath made it easy. Alwy. Well softly then; we may devise a way By which the seneschal himself will seem The secret culprit in this act. Ethw. No, no! I like it not; though I must work i' the dark, I'll not in cunningly devised light Put on my neighbour's cloak to cause his ruin. But let's to work apace! the storm shall rise! My sound shall yet be heard! Alwy. Fear not, thou shalt ere long be heard again, A dark'ning storm which shall not soon be lay'd. Ethw. Ah, thou hast touch'd where my life's life is cell'd! Is there a voice of prophecy within thee? [Catching hold of his arm eagerly. I will believe there is! my stirring soul Leapt at thy words. Such things ere now have been: Men oft have spok'n, unweeting, of themselves; Yea, the wild winds of night have utter'd words, That have unto the list'ning ear of hope Of future greatness told, ere yet the thoughts On any certain point had fix'd their hold. Alwy. Thou mayst believe it: I myself, methinks, Feel secret earnest of thy future fortune; And please myself to think my friendly hand May humbly serve, perhaps, to build thy greatness. Ethw. Come to my heart, my friend! though new in friendship, Thou, and thou only, bearst true sympathy With my aspiring soul. I can with thee Unbar my mind—Methinks thou shiv'rest, Alwy. Alwy. 'Tis very cold. Ethw. Is it? I feel it not: But in my chamber burns the crackling oak, There let us go. Alwy. If you are so inclin'd. [As they are going, Ethw. stops short, and catches hold of Alwy eagerly. Ethw. A sudden fancy strikes me: Woggarwolfe, That restless ruffian, might with little art Be rous'd on Wessex to commit aggression: Its royal chief, now leaguing with our king, Will take the field again. Alwy. We might attempt him instantly: but move, In faith I'm cold! [Exeunt. SCENE V. A dark apartment in the same castle. Woggarwolfe is discovered asleep upon a couch of rushes, and covered with a mat. Enter Alwy and a follower, with a lad bearing a torch before them. Alwy signs with his hand, and the torch-bearer retires to a distance. Alwy. Softly, ere we proceed; a sudden thought, Now crossing o'er my mind, disturbs me much. He who to-night commands the farther watch, Canst thou depend upon him? Fol. Most perfectly; and, free of hostile bounds, The British prince ere this pursues his way. Alwy. I'm satisfied: now to our present purpose. [As they advance towards the couch, Woggarwolfe is heard speaking in his sleep. Ha! speaks he in his sleep? some dream disturbs him: His quiv'ring limbs beneath the cov'ring move. He speaks again. Wog. (in his sleep). Swift, in your package stow those dead men's gear, And loose their noble coursers from the stall. Alwy. Ay, plund'ring in his sleep. Wog. Wipe thou that blade: Those bloody throats have drench'd it to the hilt. Alwy. O, hear the night-thoughts of that bloody hound! I must awake him. Ho, brave Woggarwolfe! Wog. Hear how those women scream! we'll still them shortly. Alwy. Ho, Woggarwolfe! Wog. Who calls me now? cannot you master it? [Alwy knocks upon the ground with his stick. What, batt'ring on it still? Will it not yield? Then fire the gate. Alwy (shaking him). Ho, Woggarwolfe, I say! Wog. (starting up half awake). Is not the castle taken? Alwy. Yes, it is taken. Wog. (rubbing his eyes). Pooh! it is but a dream. Alwy. But dreams full oft are found of real events The forms and shadows. There is in very deed a castle taken, In which your Wessex foes have left behind Nor stuff, nor store, nor make of living thing. Bind on thy sword and call thy men to arms! Thy boiling blood will bubble in thy veins, When thou hast heard it is the tower of Boruth. Wog. My place of strength? Fol. Yes, chief; I spoke with one new from the West, Who saw the ruinous broil. Wog. By the black fiends of hell! therein is stored The chiefest of my wealth. Upon its walls The armour of a hundred fallen chiefs Did rattle to the wind. Alwy. Now will it sound elsewhere. Wog. (in despair). My noble steeds, and all my stalled kine! O, the fell hounds! no mark of living thing? Fol. No mark of living thing. Wog. Ah! and my little arrow-bearing boy! He whom I spared amidst a slaughter'd heap, Smiling all weetless of th' uplifted stroke Hung o'er his harmless head! Like a tamed cub I rear'd him at my feet: He could tell biting jests, bold ditties sing, And quaff his foaming bumper at the board, With all the the mock'ry of a little man. By heav'n I'll leave alive within their walls Nor maid, nor youth, nor infant at the breast, If they have slain that child! blood-thirsty ruffians! Alwy. Ay, vengeance! vengeance! rouse thee like a man! Occasion tempts; the foe, not yet return'd, Have left their castle careless of defence. Call all thy followers secretly to arms: Set out upon the instant. Wog. By holy saints, I will! reach me, I pray! [Pointing to his arms lying at a little distance from him. Alwy (giving them). There, be thou speedy. Wog. (putting on his armour). Curse on those loosen'd springs, they will not catch! Oh, all the goodly armour I have lost! Light curses on my head! if I do leave them Or spear, or shield, or robe, or household stuff, Or steed within their stalls, or horn or hoof Upon their grassy hills! (Looking about.) What want I now? Mine armour-man hath ta'en away my helm— Faith, and my target too! hell blast the buzzard! [Exit furiously. Alwy (laughing). Ethwald, we have fulfill'd thy bidding well, With little cost of craft! But let us follow, And keep him to the bent. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A small close grove, with a steep rocky bank at one end of it. Several Peasants are discovered standing upon the bank, as if looking at some distant sight. 1st peas. Good lack a day! how many living souls, In wide confused eddying motion mix'd, Like cross set currents on the restless face Of winter floods! 2d peas. Where fight the Northern Mercians? 1st peas. On the right. The gentle ethling, as I am inform'd, Fights likewise on the right: heav'n spare his head! 'Tis his first battle. 3d peas. Hear, hear! still louder swells that horrid sound. 1st peas. Ay, many voices join in that loud din, Which soon shall shout no more. 3d peas. Ay, good neighbour, Full gloriously now looks that cover'd field, With all those moving ranks and glitt'ring arms; But he who shall return by setting sun Will see a sorry sight. [A loud distant noise. 1st peas. Heav'n save us all! it is the warlike yell Of those damn'd Britons that increaseth so. By all the holy saints our men are worsted! [An increasing noise heard without. Look! yonder look! they turn their backs and flee. 3d peas. O blasting shame! where fights brave Ethwald now? He is, I fear, far in the distant wing. Let us be gone! we are too near them here: The flight comes this way: hear that horrid sound! The saints preserve us! [The sound of the battle increases, and is heard nearer. The peasants come hastily down from the bank, and exeunt. Enter Edward with several followers disordered and panicstricken. 1st fol. (looking round). They cease to follow us: this tangled grove Has stopp'd the fell pursuit: here may we rest. [Edward throws himself down at the root of a tree, and covers his face with his hands. 2d fol. (filling his helmet with water from a stream, and presenting it to Edw.) My prince, this cooling water will refresh you. Edw. (keeping his face still covered with one hand, and waving him off with the other). Away, away! and do not speak to me! [A deep pause, the noise of the battle is again heard coming nearer. 1st fol. We must not tarry here. (To Edw.) My lord, the farther thickets of this wood Will prove a sure concealment: shall we move? Edw. (still covering his face). Let the earth gape and hide me. (Another deep pause. 3d fol. to 1st. The sin of all this rout falls on thy head, Thou cursed Thane! thou and thy hireling knaves First turn'd your backs and fled. 1st fol. to 3d. Thou liest, foul tongue! it was thy kinsman there Who first did turn; for I was borne away, [Pointing to 4th fol. Unwillingly away, by the rude stream Of his fear-stricken bands. When, till this hour, Did ever armed Briton see my back? 4th fol. Arm'd Britons dost thou call them?— devils they are! Thou knowst right well they deal with wicked sprites. Those horrid yells were not the cries of men; And fiends of hell look'd through their flashing eyes. I fear to face the power of simple man As little as thyself. Enter more Fugitives. 1st fol. (to Edw.) Up, my good lord! Hence let us quickly move; We must not stay. Edw. Then thrust me through and leave me. I'll flee no more. (Looking up wildly, then fixing his eyes wistfully upon 3d follower, and bending one knee to the ground.) Ebbert, thy sword is keen, thy arm is strong; O, quickly do't! and I shall be with those Who feel nor shame nor panic. [3d fol. and several others turn their faces away and weep. Enter more fugitives. 1st fol. What, is all lost? 1st fug. Yes, yes! our wing is beaten. Seagurth alone, with a few desp'rate men, Still sets his aged breast against the storm: But thick the aimed weapons round him fly, Like huntsmen's arrows round the toiled boar. And he will soon be nothing. Edw. (starting up). O, God! O, living God! my noble father! He has no son!—Off, ye debasing fears! I'll tear thee forth, base heart, if thou dost let me. [Coming forward and stretching out his arms. Companions, noble Mercians—Ah, false word! I may not call you noble. Yet, perhaps, One gen'rous spark within your bosom glows. Sunk in disgrace still lower than ye all, I may not urge—Who lists will follow me! All with one voice. We will all follow thee! Edw. Will ye, in truth? then we'll be brave men still. [Brandishing his sword as he goes off. My noble father! [Exeunt, clashing their arms. SCENE II. A confused noise of a battle is heard. The scene draws up and discovers the British and Mercian armies engaged. Near the front of the stage they are seen in close fight, and the ground strewed with several wounded and dead soldiers, as if they had been fighting for some time. Farther off, missile weapons and showers of arrows darken the air, and the view of the more distant battle is concealed in thick clouds of dust. The Mercians gain ground upon the Britons; and loud cries are raised by them to encourage one another. An active Mercian falls, and their progress is stopped whilst they endeavour to bear him off. Fallen Mercian. I'm slain, I'm slain! tread o'er me, and push forward. Mer. Chief. O stop not thus! to it again, brave Mercians! [The Mercians push on, encouraging one another with cries and clashing of arms; one of their bravest soldiers is wounded on the front of the stage and staggers backwards. Wounded Mer. Ay, this is death; O that my life had held To see the end of this most noble game! [Falls down, but seeing the Mercians about to push the Britons off the stage, raises himself half from the ground and claps his hands exultingly. Well fought, brave Mercians! On, my noble Mercians! [Sinks down again. I am in darkness now! a clod o' the earth! [Dies. Britons (without). Fresh succour, Britons! courage! victory! Carwallen and fresh succour! [The Britons now raise a terrible yell, and push back the Mercians, who yield ground and become spiritless and relaxed as their enemy becomes bolder. The Britons at last seize the Mercian standard, and raise another terrible yell, whilst the Mercians give way on every side. 1st falling Mer. Horror and death! the hand of wrath is o'er us! 2d falling Mer. A fell and fearful end! a bloody lair! The trampling foe to tread out brave men's breath. [The Britons yell again, and the Mercians are nearly beat off the stage. (Voice without.) Ethwald! the valiant Ethwald! succour, Mercians! (Voice within.) Hear ye, brave comrades? Ethwald is at hand. Enter Ethwald with his sword drawn. Ethw. What, soldiers! yield ye thus, while vict'ry smiles And bids us on to th' bent? Your northern comrades Mock at their savage howls, and drive before them These chafed beasts of prey. Come! to it bravely! To it, and let their mountain matrons howl, For these will soon be silent. Give me the standard. Voice. They have taken it. Ethw. Taken! no, by the spirits of the brave! Standard of ours on Snowdon winds to float! No! this shall fetch it back! [Taking off his helmet and throwing it into the midst of the enemy, then rushing upon them bare-headed and sword in hand. The Mercians clash their arms and raise a great shout: the Britons are driven off the stage; whilst many of the dying Mercians clap their hands and raise a feeble shout after their comrades. The scene closes. SCENE III. An open space before a royal tent; the curtains of which are drawn up, and show a company of warriors and dames within it. On either side of the open stage soldiers are drawn up in order. Enter two petty Thanes on the front of the stage. 1st Thane. Here let us stand and see the ceremony. Without the tent, 'tis said the king will crown The gallant ethling with a wreath of honour, As the chief agent in this victory O'er stern Carwallen and his Britons gain'd. 2d Thane. Thou sayest well. Within the royal tent They wait, as I am told, the ethling's coming, Who is full tardy. Softly, they come forth. Probably I have received this idea from Samson Agonistes, where Dalilah is compared to a stately ship of Tarsus “with all her bravery on, and tackle trim,” &amp;c. How like a ship with all her goodly sails Spread to the sun, the haughty princess moves! [A flourish of trumpets. Enter from the tent the King, with Ethelbert, Edrick, Thanes, and attendants; and Elburga, with Dwina and ladies. They advance towards the front of the stage. King. Nay, sweet Elburga, clear thy frowning brow; He who is absent will not long delay His pleasing duty here. Elb. On such a day, my lord, the brave I honour, As those who have your royal arms maintain'd In war's iron field, such honour meriting. What individual chiefs, or here or absent, May therein be concern'd, I little care; I deign not to regard it. King. Thou art offended, daughter, but unwisely. Plumed with the fairest honours of the field, Such pious grief for a brave father's death, Bespeaks a heart such as a gentle maid In her faith-plighted lord should joy to find. Elb. Who best the royal honours of a prince Maintains, best suits a royal maiden's love. King. Elburga, thou forgetst that gentleness Which suits thy gentle kind. Elb. (with much assumed stateliness). I hope, my lord, I do meantime that dignity remember, Which doth beseem the daughter of a king! King. Fie! clear thy cloudy brow! it is my will Thou honour graciously his modest worth. [Elb. bows, but smiles disdainfully. By a well feigned flight, he was the first Who broke the stubborn foe, op'ning the road To victory. Here, with some public mark Of royal favour, by the hand receiv'd, I will to honour him; for, since the battle, A gloomy melancholy o'er him broods, E'en far exceeding what a father's death Should cast upon a youthful victor's triumph. Ah! here he comes! look on that joyless face! Elb. (aside to Dwina, looking scornfully to Edward as he approaches). Look with what slow and piteous gait he comes! Like younger brother of a petty Thane, Timing his footsteps to his father's dirge. Dwina. (aside). Nay, to my fancy it is wond'rous graceful. Elb. (contemptuously). A youth, indeed, who might with humble grace Beneath thy window tell his piteous tale. Enter Edward followed by Ethwald and attend-ants. King. Approach, my son: so will I call thee now. Here is a face whose smiles should gild thy honours If thou art yet awake to beauty's power. Edw. (kissing Elburga's hand respectfully). Honour'd I am indeed; most dearly honour'd; I feel it here (his hand on his heart), and should be joyful too, If aught could gild my gloom. [Sighs very deeply, then suddenly recollecting himself. Elburga, thou wert ever fond of glory, And ever quick to honour valiant worth; Ethwald, my friend—hast thou forgotten Ethwald? [Presenting Ethw. to her. Elb. Could I forget the warlike Thane of Mairnieth, I must have barr'd mine ears against all sound; For every voice is powerful in his praise, And every Mercian tongue repeats his name. [Smiling graciously upon Ethw. King (impatiently). Where go we now? we wander from our purpose. Edward, thy youthful ardour season'd well With warlike craft, has crown'd my age with glory; Here be thy valour crown'd, it is my will, With honour's wreath, from a fair hand receiv'd. [Giving the wreath to Elburga. Edw. (earnestly). I do beseech you, uncle!—pray receive My grateful thanks! the mournful cypress best Becomes my brow; this honour must not be. King. Nay, lay aside unseemly diffidence; It must be so. Edw. (impressively). My heart is much depress'd: O do not add The burden of an undeserved honour, To bend me to the earth! King. These warlike chieftains say it is deserv'd, And nobly earn'd. It is with their concurrence That now I offer thee this warrior's wreath; Yes, ethling, and command thee to receive it. (Holding up his hand.) There, let the trumpet sound. [Trumpets sound. Edw. (holding up his hands distractedly). Peace, peace! nor put me to this agony! [Trumpets cease. And am I then push'd to this very point? Well, then, away deceit! too long hast thou Like the incumbent monster of a dream On the stretch'd sleeper's breast, depress'd my soul; I shake thee off, foul mate! O, royal sire, And you, ye valiant Mercians, hear the truth! Ye have believ'd, that by a feigned flight, I gain'd the first advantage o'er the foe, And broke their battle's strength; O would I had! That flight, alas! was real; the sudden impulse Of a weak mind, unprov'd and strongly struck With new and horrid things, until that hour Unknown and unimagin'd.— Nor was it honour's voice that call'd me back; The call of nature saved me. Noble Seagurth, Had I been son of any sire but thee, I had in dark and endless shame been lost, Nor e'er again before these valiant men Stood in this royal presence. In all my fortune, I am blest alone That my brave father, rescued by these arms, Look'd on me, smiling through the shades of death, And knew his son. He was a noble man! He never turn'd from danger—but his son— (Many voices at once.) His son is worthy of him! (Repeated again with more voices.) His son is worthy of him! Ethelbert (with enthusiasm). His son is worthy Of the noblest sire that ever wielded sword! Voices. Crown him, fair princess! Crown the noble Edward! [Elburga offers him the wreath, which he puts aside vehemently. Edw. Forbear! a band of scorpions round my brow Would not torment me like this laurel wreath. [Elb. turns from him contemptuously, and gives the wreath to the King. Edw. (to King). What, good my lord! is there not present here A Mercian brow deserving of that wreath? Shall he, who did with an uncover'd head Your battle fight, still wear his brows unbound? Do us not this disgrace! King (fretfully). Thou dost forget the royal dignity: Take it away. Giving it to an officer.) [A confused murmuring amongst the soldiers. (Aside to the seneschal, alarmed.) What noise is that? Sen. (aside to King). Your troops, my sire, are much dissatisfied, For that their favourite chief by you is deem'd Unworthy of the wreath. King (aside). What, is it so? call back mine officer. (Taking the wreath again, and giving it to Elb.) This wreath was meant for one of royal line, But every noble Mercian, great in arms, Is equal to a prince. Crown the most valiant Ethwald. Elb. (crowning Ethw. with great assumed majesty). Long may thy laurels flourish on thy brow, Most noble chief! [Ethw. takes the wreath and presses it to his lips, bowing to Elb., then to the King. Ethw. They who beneath the royal banner fight, Unto the fortunes of their royal chief Their success owe. Honour'd, indeed, am I That the brave ethling hath so favour'd me, And that I may, most humbly at your feet, My royal sire, this martial garland lay. [He, kneeling, lays the wreath at the King's feet; the King raises him up and embraces him; the soldiers clash their arms and call out. Sold. Long live the king! and long live noble Ethwald! [This is several times repeated. Exeunt King, Edward, Elburga, &amp;c. &amp;c.; Elburga looking graciously to Ethwald as she goes off. Manent Ethwald and Ethelbert. Eth. (repeating indignantly as they go off). Long live the king, and long live noble Ethwald! Fie on the stupid clowns, that did not join The gen'rous Edward's name! (To Ethw., who is standing looking earnestly after the princess.) What dost thou gaze on? Ethw. The princess look'd behind her as she went. Eth. And what is that to thee? [Walks silently across the stage once or twice gloomy and dissatisfied, then turning short upon Ethw. When wert thou last to see the lovely Bertha? Ethw. (hesitating). I cannot reckon it unto the day— Some moons ago. Eth. Some moons! the moon in her wide course shines not Upon a maid more lovely. Ethw. I know it well. Eth. Thou dost. Ethw. (after a pause, looking attentively to Eth., who stands muttering to himself). Methinks thou holdest converse with thyself. Eth. (speaking aloud, as if he continued to talk to himself). She steps upon the flowery bosom'd earth, As though it were a foot-cloth fitly placed Beneath the tread of her majestic step; And looks upon the human countenance, Whereon her Maker hath the signs impress'd Of all that He within the soul hath stored Of great and noble, gen'rous and benign, As on a molten plate, made to reflect Her grandeur and perfections. Ethw. Of whom speakst thou? Eth. Not of the gentle Bertha. [Exit. Ethw. What may he mean? He mark'd, with much displeasure, The soldiers shout my name, and now my favour With Mercia's princess frets him. What of this? Ha! hath his active mind outrun mine own In shaping future consequences? Yes, It must be so, a curtain is withdrawn, And to mine eye a goodly prospect shown, Extending—No, I must not look upon it. [Exit hastily. SCENE IV. An open space, with arms, garments, and other spoils of the Britons heaped up on every side of the stage. Enter Soldiers, and range themselves in order; then enter Ethelbert and a Soldier, talking as they enter. Eth. Ethwald among his soldiers, dost thou say, Divides his spoil? Sol. He does, most bountifully; Nor to himself more than a soldier's share Retains, he is so gen'rous and so noble. Eth. I thank thee, friend. [Soldier retires. (After a pause.) I like not this: behind those heaps I'll stand, And mark the manner of this distribution. [Retires. Enter Alwy and a petty Thane. Alwy. Brave warriors! ye are come at his desire, Who for each humble soldier, bold in arms, That has beneath his orders fought, still bears A brother's heart. You see these goodly spoils: He gives them not unto the cloister'd priests: His soldiers pray for him. [Soldiers shout. Thane (to Alwy). What is thy meaning? Alwy. Knowest thou not the king has now bestow'd The chiefest portion of his British spoil On Alban's abbey? Enter Ethwald. (Soldiers shouting very loud.) Long live brave Ethwald! health to noble Ethwald! Ethw. Thanks for these kindly greetings, valiant hearts! [Soldiers shout again very loud. In truth I stand before you, brave companions, Somewhat asham'd; for with my wishes match'd, These hands are poor and empty. [Loud acclamations. I thank you all again; for well I see You have respect unto the dear good will That must enrich these heaps of homely stuff. Soldiers. Long live our gen'rous leader! Ethw. (giving a soldier a helmet filled with lots). Here, take the lots and deal them fairly round. Heaven send to all of you, my valiant friends, A portion to your liking. This rough heap [Pointing to the arms. Will give at least to each some warlike trophy, Which henceforth, hung upon his humble walls, Shall tell his sons and grandsons yet to come In what proud fields, and with what gallant mates Their father fought. And I, methinks, well pleas'd, Resting, as heretofore I oft have done, My wand'ring steps beneath your friendly roofs, Shall, looking up, the friendly token spy, And in my host a fellow soldier hail. Soldiers (with loud acclamations). God bless you, noble chief! unto the death We'll hold to you, brave leader! Ethw. And if to you I hold not, valiant Mercians, No noble chief am I. This motley gear, [Pointing to the spoils. Would it were all composed of precious things, That to his gentle wife or favour'd maid, Each soldier might have borne some goodly gift! But tell them, British matrons cross the woof With coarser hands than theirs. 1st sol. Saint Alban bless his noble countenance! 'Twas fashion'd for bestowing. 2d sol. Heav'n store his halls with wealth! Ethw. (going familiarly amongst the soldiers as the lots are drawing). Well, Ogar, hast thou drawn? good luck to thee. And thou, good Baldwin, too? Yet fie upon it! The heaviest weapon of the British host Lacks weight of metal for thy sinewy arm.— Ha! health to thee, mine old and honest host! I'm glad to see thee with thine arm unbound. And ruddy too! thy dame should give me thanks: I send thee home to her a younger man Than I receiv'd thee. (To the soldier with the lots who is passing him.) Nay, stay thee, friend, I pray, nor pass me o'er, We all must share alike: hold out thy cap. [Smiling as he draws. The knave would leave me out. [Loud acclamations, the soldiers surrounding him and clashing their arms. Enter Selred and Followers. Sel. (to sol.) Ha! whence comes all this uproar? Sol. Know you not? Your noble brother 'midst his soldiers shares His British spoils. Sel. The grateful knaves! is all their joy for this? [To his followers. Well, go and add to it my portion also; 'Twill make them roar the louder. Do it quickly. [Exit. Soldiers (looking after Sel.). Heaven bless him too, plain, honest, careless soul! He gives as though he gave not. [Loud acclamations. Long live brave Ethwald, and the noble Selred! Ethw. (aside to Alwy, displeased). How came he here? Alwy. I cannot tell. Ethw. (to sol.) We are confined within this narrow space: Go range yourselves at large on yon green sward, And there we'll spread the lots. [Exeunt; the soldiers arranging themselves as they go. SCENE V. An apartment in a royal castle. Enter Ethelbert, and leans his back upon a pillar near the front of the stage, as if deeply engaged in gloomy thoughts: afterwards enters Ethwald by the opposite side, at the bottom of the stage, and approaches Eth. slowly, observing him attentively as he advances. Ethw. Thou art disturbed, Ethelbert. Eth. I am. Ethw. Thine eyes roll strangely, as though thou beheldst Some dreadful thing:— On what lookst thou? Eth. Upon my country's ruin. The land is full of blood: her savage birds O'er human carcases do scream and batten: The silent hamlet smokes not; in the field The aged grandsire turns the joyless soil: Dark spirits are abroad, and gentle worth Within the narrow house of death is laid, An early tenant. Ethw. Thou'rt beside thyself! Thinkst thou that I, with these good arms, will stand And suffer all this wreck? Eth. Ha! sayst thou so? Alas, it is thyself Who rul'st the tempest! [Shaking his head solemnly. Ethw. If that I bear the spirit of a man, Thou falsely seest! Thinkst thou I am a beast; A fanged wolf, reft of all kindly sense, That I should do such deeds? I am a man aspiring to be great, But loathing cruelty: who wears a sword That will protect and not destroy the feeble. [Putting his hand vehemently upon his sword. Eth. Ha! art thou roused? blessings on thy wrath! I'll trust thee still. But see, the ethling comes, And on his face he wears a smile of joy. Enter Edward, advancing gaily to Ethwald. Edw. A boon, a boon, great Mairnieth's Thane, I crave. Eth. You come not with a suppliant's face, my lord. Edw. Not much cast down for lack of confidence My suit to gain. That envious braggart there, The chief of Bournoth, says, no Mercian arm, Of man now living, can his grandsire's sword In warlike combat wield: and, in good sooth! I forfeit forty of my fattest kine If Ethwald's arm does not the feat achieve. (To Ethw.) What sayst thou, friend? Methinks thou'rt grave and silent: Hast thou so soon thy noble trade forgot? Have at it then! I'll rouse thy spirit up: I'll soldier thee again. [Drawing his sword playfully upon Ethwald, who defends himself in like manner. Fie on't! that was a wicked northern push: It tells of thine old sports in Mollo's walls. [Pauses and fights again. To it again! How listless thou art grown! Where is thy manhood gone? Ethw. Fear not, my lord, enough remains behind To win your forty kine. Edw. I'll take thy word for't now: in faith, I'm tired! I've been too eager in the morning's chace To fight your noonday battles. [Putting the point of his sword to the ground, and leaning familiarly upon Ethwald. My arm, I fear, would make but little gain With Bournoth's sword. By arms and brave men's love! I could not brook to see that wordy braggart Perching his paltry sire above thy pitch; It rais'd my fiend within. When I am great, I'll build a tower upon the very spot Where thou didst first the British army stay, And shame the grandsires of those mighty Thanes Six ages deep. Lean I too hard upon thee? Ethw. No, nothing hard: most pleasant and most kindly. Take your full rest, my lord. Edw. In truth, I do: methinks it does me good To rest upon thy brave and valiant breast. Eth. (stepping before them with great animation). Well said, most noble Edward! The bosom of the brave is that on which Rests many a head: but most of all, I trow, Th' exposed head of princely youth thereon Rests gracefully. [Steps back some paces, and looks at them with delight. Edw. You look upon us, Thane, with eager eyes And looks of meaning. Eth. Pardon me, I pray! My fancy oftentimes will wildly play, And strong conceits possess me. Indulge my passing freak: I am a man Upon whose grizzled head the work of time Hath been by care perform'd, and, with the young, Claiming the priv'lege of a man in years. [Taking the hands of Edw. and Ethw. and joining them together. This is a lovely sight! indulge my fancy: And on this sword, it is a brave man's sword, Swear that you will unto each other prove, As prince and subject, true. Edw. No, no, good Thane! As friends, true friends! that doth the whole include. I kiss the honour'd blade. (Kissing the sword held out by Eth.) Eth. (presenting the sword to Ethw.) And what says noble Ethwald? Ethw. All that the brave should say. (Kissing it also.) Eth. (triumphantly). Now, Mercia, thou art strong! give me your hands; Faith, I must lay them both upon my breast! [Pressing both their hands to his breast. This is a lovely sight! Ethw. (softened). You weep, good Ethelbert. Eth. (brushing off his tears with his hand). Yes, yes! such tears as doth the warm shower'd earth Show to the kindly sun. Edw. (to Eth., gently clapping his shoulder). I love this well: thou like a woman weepest, And fightest like a man. But look, I pray! There comes my arms-man with the braggart's sword: Let us essay it yonder. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An apartment in a royal castle. Ethwald is discovered sitting in deep meditation by the side of a couch, with a lamp burning by him on a high stand: the rest of the stage entirely dark. Ethw. Why am I haunted with these thoughts? What boots it That from their weak and priest-beridden king The soldiers turn distasteful, and on me In mutter'd wishes call? What boots all this? Occasion fairly smiles, but I am shackled; Elsewhere I needs must turn my climbing thoughts, But where? The youthful see around them spread A boundless field of undetermin'd things, Towering in tempting greatness: But, to the closer scan of men matured, These fade away, and in the actual state Of times and circumstances each perceives A path which doth to his advancement lead, And only one; as to the dazzled eye Of the night rev'ller, o'er his emptied bowl, The multiplied and many whirling lights Do shrink at last into one single torch, Shedding a steady ray. I see my path: But what is that to me? my steps are chain'd. Amongst the mighty great, the earth's high lords, There is no place for me! I must lie down In the dark tomb with those, whose passing brightness Shines for a while, but leaves no ray behind. [Throws himself half upon the couch and groans heavily. Enter Boy. Boy. My lord, my lord! (Ethw. lifts up his head, and looks sternly at him.) Are you unwell, my lord? Ethw. What dost thou want? Boy. I could not sleep: and as I list'ning lay To the drear wind that whistles through these towers, Methought I heard you groan like one in pain. Ethw. Away, and go to sleep: I want thee not: I say, begone (sternly). [Exit boy. [He pauses awhile, then sighs very deeply. He hangs upon me like a dead man's grasp On the wreck'd swimmer's neck—his boyish love Was not my seeking; it was fasten'd on me, And now it hath become an iron band To fetter down my powers. O that I were Amidst the warlike and ungentle cast To strive uncumber'd! What have I to do With soft affection? (Softened.) Yet it needs must be! His gen'rous love:—his brave ungrudging love: His manly gentle love—O that he had Mine equal friend been born, who in my rise Had fair advancement found, and by my side The next in honour stood! He drags me to the earth! I needs must lay My head i' the dust.—Dull hopeless privacy! From it my soul recoils: unto my nature It is the death of death, horrid and hateful. (Starting up eagerly.) No, in the tossed bark, Commander of a rude tumultuous crew, On the wild ocean would I rather live; Or in the mined caverns of the earth Untamed bands of lawless men control, By crime and dire necessity enleagued: Yea, in the dread turmoil of midnight storms, If such there be, lead on the sable hosts Of restless sprites, than say to mortal man “Thou art my master.” Enter Boy. What, here again? Boy. O pardon me, my lord! I am in fear; Strange sounds do howl and hurtle round my bed; I cannot rest. Ethw. Begone, thou wakeful pest! I say, be-gone! [Exit boy. [Ethw. walks several times across the stage and then pauses. Yet in my mind one ever-present thought Rises omnipotent o'er all the rest, And says, “Thou shalt be great.” What may this mean? before me is no way. What deep endued seer will draw this veil Of dark futurity? Of such I've heard, But when the troubled seek for them, they are not. Re-enter Boy. (Stamping with his foot.) What! here a third time? Boy (falling at his feet). O, my noble master! If you should slay me I must come to you; For in my chamber fearful things there be, That sound i' the dark; O, do not chide me back. Ethw. Strange sound within thy chamber, foolish wight! Boy (starting). Good mercy, list! Ethw. It is some night-bird screaming on the tower. Boy. Ay, so belike it seemeth, but I know— Ethw. What dost thou know? Boy. It is no bird, my lord. Ethw. What wouldst thou say? Boy (clasping his hands together, and staring earnestly in Ethw.'s face). At dead of night, from the dark Druid's cave Up rise unhallow'd sprites, and o'er the earth Hold for the term their wicked rule. Aloft, Some mounted on the heavy sailing cloud, Oft pour down noisome streams or biting hail On the benighted hind, and from his home, With wayward eddying blasts, still beat him back. Some on the waters shriek like drowning men, And, when the pitying passenger springs forth, To lend his aid, the dark flood swallows him. Some on lone marshes shine like moving lights; And some on towers and castle turrets perch'd, Do scream like nightly birds, to scare the good, Or rouse the murd'rer to his bloody work. Ethw. The Druid's cave, sayst thou? What cave is that? Where is it? Who hath seen it? What scar'd fool Hath fill'd thine ears with all these horrid things? Boy. It is a cavern vast and terrible, Under the ground full deep; perhaps, my lord, Beneath our very feet, here as we stand; For few do know the spot and centre of it, Though many mouths it has and entries dark. Some are like hollow pits bor'd through the earth, O'er which the list'ning herdsman bends his ear, And hears afar their lakes of molten fire Swelt'ring and boiling like a mighty pot. Some like strait passes through the rifted rocks, From which oft issue shrieks, and whistling gusts, And wailings dismal. Nay, some, as they say, Deep hollow'd underneath the river's bed, Which show their narrow op'nings through the fern And tangling briars, like dank and noisome holes Wherein foul adders breed. But not far hence The chiefest mouth of all, 'midst beetling rocks And groves of blasted oaks, gapes terrible. Ethw. So near? but who are they who dwell within? Boy. The female high Arch Druid therein holds It is natural to suppose that the diviners or fortune-tellers of this period should, in their superstitions and pretensions, very much resemble the ancient Druidesses who were so much revered amongst the Britons as oracles and prophetesses, and that they should, amongst the vulgar, still retain the name of their great predecessors. In Henry's History of Britain, vol. i. p. 181., it will be found that the superstitious practices of the Druids continued long after their religion was abolished, and resisted for a long time the light of Christianity; and that even so late as the reign of Canute, it was necessary to make laws against it. With many Druids tending on her will, (Old, as they say, some hundred years or more) Her court, where horrid spells bind to her rule Spirits of earth and air. Ethw. Ay, so they tell thee, But who is he that has held converse with her? Boy. Crannock, the bloody prince, did visit her, And she did show to him the bloody end Whereto he soon should come; for all she knows That is, or has been, or shall come to pass. Ethw. Yes, in times past such intercourse might be, But who has seen them now? Boy. Thane Ethelbert. Ethw. (starting). What saidst thou, Ethelbert? Boy. Yes, truly; oft he goes to visit them What time the moon rides in her middle course. Ethw. Art thou assured of this? Boy. A youth who saw him issue from the cave; 'Twas he who told it me. Ethw. Mysterious man! (After a pause.) Where sleeps the Thane? Boy. If walls and doors may hold him, He sleeps not distant, in the southern tower. Ethw. Take thou that lamp, and go before me then. Boy. Where? Ethw. To the southern tower. Art thou afraid? Boy. No, my good lord, but keep you close behind. [Exeunt; Boy bearing the lamp, and looking often behind to see that Ethw. is near him. SCENE II. A small gallery or passage with a door in front, which is opened, and enter Ethwald, and Ethelbert with a lamp in his hand. Eth. Then, by the morrow's midnight moon, we meet At the Arch Sister's cave: till then, farewell! Ethw. Farewell! I will be punctual. [Exit. Eth. (looking after him for some time before he speaks). It ever is the mark'd propensity Of restless and aspiring minds to look Into the stretch of dark futurity. But be it so: it now may turn to good. [Exit, returning back again into the same chamber from which he came. SCENE III. A wide arched cave, rude but grand, seen by a sombre light, a small furnace burning near the front of the stage. Enter Ethwald and Ethelbert, who pause and look round for some time without speaking. Ethw. Gloomy, and void, and silent! Eth. Hush! Ethw. What hearest thou? Eth. Their hollow sounding steps. Lo! seest thou not? [Pointing to the further end of the stage, where, from an obscure recess, enter three Mystics robed in white, and ranged on one side of the stage, point to Ethwald: whilst from another obscure recess enter three Mystic Sisters, and ranged on the opposite side point to Ethwald: then from a mid recess enters the Arch Sister robed also in white, but more majestic than the others, and a train of Mystics and Mystic Sisters behind her. She advances half-way up the stage, then stops short, and points also to Ethwald. (All the Mystics, &amp;c. speaking at once.) Who art thou? Arch Sist. I know thee who thou art; the hand of Mercia. The hand that lifts itself above the head. I know thee who thou art. Ethw. Then haply ye do know my errand too. Arch Sist. I do; but turn thee back upon thy steps, And tempt thy fate no farther. Ethw. From the chaf'd shore turn back the swelling tide! I came to know my fate, and I will know it. 1st Mystic. Must we call up from the deep centre's womb The spirits of the night and their dread lord? 1st Myst. S. Must we do that which makes the entombed dead From coffins start? Ethw. Raise the whole host of darkness an ye will, But I must be obey'd. [The Arch Sister shrieks, and, throwing her mantle over her face, turns to go away. Ethw. If there be power in mortal arm to hold you, Ye stir not hence until I am obey'd. 1st Myst. And how compellest thou? Ethw. With this good sword. 1st Myst. Swords here are children's wands of no avail: There, warrior, is thy weapon. Ethw. Where, Mystic? say. 1st Myst. (pointing to the furnace). Behold within that fire A bar of burning iron! pluck it forth. Ethw. (resolutely). I will. [Goes to the furnace, and putting in his hand, pulls out what seems a red hot bar of iron. Arch Sist. (throwing off her mantle). Thou hast subdued me; thou shalt be obey'd. Ethw. (casting away the bar). Away, thou paltry terror! Arch Sist. (to Ethw.) We now begin our rites: be firm, be silent. [She stretches forth her hand with a commanding air, and the Mystics and Mystic Sisters begin their incantations at the bottom of the stage, moving round in several mazy circles one within another. Fire is at last seen flashing from the midst of the inner circle, and immediately they all begin a hollow muttering sound, which becomes louder and louder, till at length it is accompanied with dismal sounds from without, and distant music, solemn and wild. Ethw. (grasping Ethelbert's hand). What dismal sounds are these? 'Tis like a wild responsive harmony, Tun'd to the answ'ring yells of damned souls. What follows this? Some horrid thing! Thou smilest: Nay, press thy hand, I pray thee, on my breast; There wilt thou find no fear, Eth. Hush! hear that distant noise. Ethw. 'Tis thunder in the bowels of the earth, Heard from afar. [A subterraneous noise like thunder is heard at a distance, becoming louder as it approaches. Upon hearing this, the Mystics suddenly leave off their rites; the music ceases, and they, opening their circles, range themselves on either side of the stage, leaving the Arch Sister alone in the middle. Arch Sist. (holding up her hand). Mystics, and Mystic Maids, and leagued bands! The master spirit comes: prepare. (All repeat after her). Prepare. 1st Mystic. Hark! through the darken'd realms below, Through the fiery regions glow: Through the massy mountain's core, Through the mines of living ore; Through the yawning caverns wide, Through the solid and the void; Through the dank and through the dry, Through th' unseen of mortal eye: Upon the earthquake's secret course, afar I hear the sounding of thy car: Sulphureous vapours load the rising gale; We know thy coming; mighty master, hail! (They all repeat.) Mighty master, hail! [The stage darkens by degrees, and a thick vapour begins to ascend at the bottom of the stage. 2d Mystic. Hark, hark! what murmurs fill the dome! Who are they who with thee come? Those who, in their upward flight, Rouse the tempests of the night: Those who ride in flood and fire; Those who rock the tumbling spire: Those who, on the bloody plain, Shriek with the voices of the slain: Those who through the darkness glare, And the sleepless murd'rer scare; Those who take their surly rest On the troubled dreamer's breast: Those who make their nightly den In the guilty haunts of men: Through the heavy air I hear Their hollow trooping onward bear: The torch's shrinking flame is dim and pale: I know thy coming; mighty master, hail! (All repeat again). Mighty master, hail! [The stage becomes still darker, and a thicker vapour ascends. 3d Mystic. Lo! the mystic volumes rise! Wherein are lapt from mortal eyes Horrid deeds as yet unthought, Bloody battles yet unfought: The sudden fall and deadly wound Of the tyrant yet uncrown'd; And his line of many dyes Who yet within the cradle lies. Moving forms, whose stilly bed Long hath been among the dead; Moving forms, whose living morn Breaks with the nations yet unborn, In mystic vision walk the horrid pale: We own thy presence; mighty master, hail! (All). Mighty master, hail! Enter from the farther end of the stage crowds of terrible spectres, dimly seen through the vapour, which now spreads itself over the whole stage. All the Mystics and Mystic Sisters bow themselves very low, and the Arch Sister, standing alone in the middle, bows to all the different sides of the cave. Ethw. (to 1st Mystic). To every side the mystic mistress bows, What meaneth this? mine eye no form perceives: Where is your mighty chief? 1st Mystic. Above, around you, and beneath. Ethw. Has he no form to vision sensible? 1st Mystic. In the night's noon, in the winter's noon, in the lustre's noon: Of times twice ten within the century's round Is he before our leagued bands confess'd In dread appearance: But in what form or in what circumstance May not be told; he dies who utters it. [Ethw. shrinks at this, and seems somewhat appalled. The Arch Sister, after tossing about her arms, and writhing her body in a violent agitation, fixes her eyes, like one waked from a dream, steadfastly upon Ethw.; then going suddenly up to him, grasps him by the hand with energy. Arch Sist. Thou who wouldst pierce the deep and awful shade Of dark futurity, to know the state Of after greatness waiting on thy will, For in thy power acceptance or rejection Is freely put, lift up thine eyes and say, What seest thou yonder? [Pointing to a dark arched opening in the roof of the cave, where an illuminated crown and sceptre appear. Ethw. (starting). Ha! e'en the inward vision of my soul In actual form pourtray'd! [His eyes brightening wonderfully. Sayst thou it shall be mine? Arch Sist. As thou shalt choose. Ethw. I ask of thee no more. [Stands gazing upon the appearance till it fades away. So soon extinguish'd? Hath this too a meaning? It says, perhaps, my greatness shall be short. Arch Sist. I speak to thee no further than I may, Therefore be satisfied. Ethw. And I am satisfied. Dread mystic maid, Receive my thanks. Arch Sist. Nay, Ethwald, our commission ends not here, Stay and behold what follows. [The stage becomes suddenly dark, and most terrible shrieks, and groans, and dismal lamentations, are heard from the farther end of the cave. Ethw. What horrid sounds are these? Arch Sist. The varied voice of woe, of Mercia's woe: Of those who shall, beneath thine iron hand, The cup of mis'ry drink. There, dost thou hear The dungeon'd captives' sighs, the shrilly shrieks Of childless mothers and distracted maids, Mix'd with the heavy groans of dying men! The widow's wailings, too, and infant's cries— [Ethw. stops his ears in horror. Ay, stop thine ears; it is a horrid sound. Ethw. Forefend that e'er again I hear the like! What didst thou say? O, thou didst foully say! Do I not know my nature? heav'n and earth As soon shall change— (A voice above.) Swear not! (A voice beneath.) Swear not! (A voice on the same level, but distant.) Swear not! Arch Sist. Now, once again, and our commission ends. Look yonder, and behold that shadowy form. [Pointing to an arched recess, across which bursts a strong light, and discovers a crowned phantom, covered with wounds, and representing by its gestures one in agony. Ethw. looks and shrinks back. What dost thou see? Ethw. A miserable man: his breast is pierced With many wounds, and yet his gestures seem The agony of a distracted mind, More than of pain. Arch. Sist. But wears he not a crown? Ethw. Why does it look so fix'dly on me thus? What are its woes to me? Arch Sist. They are thy own. Knowst thou no traces of that alter'd form, Nor seest that crowned phantom is thyself? Ethw. (shudders, then after a pause). I may be doom'd to meet a tyrant's end, But not to be a tyrant. Did all the powers of hell attest the doom, I would belie it. Know I not my nature? By every dreaded power and hallow'd thing— (Voice over the stage.) Swear not! (Voice under the stage.) Swear not! (Distant voice off the stage.) Swear not! [Thundering noise is heard under ground. The stage becomes instantly quite dark, and Mystics and Spirits, &amp;c. disappear, Ethw. and Eth. remaining alone. Eth. (after a pause). How art thou? Ethw. Is it thy voice? O, let me feel thy grasp! Mine ears ring strangely, and my head doth feel As though I were bereaved of my wits. Are they all gone? Where is thy hand, I pray? We've had a fearful bout! Eth. Thy touch is cold as death: let us ascend And breathe the upper air. I will not take upon me to say that, if I had never read Shakspeare's Macbeth, I should have thought of bringing Ethwald into a cavern under ground to inquire his destiny, though I believe this desire to look into futurity (particularly in a superstitious age) is a very constant attendant on ambition; but I hope the reader will not find in the above scene any offensive use made of the works of that great master. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A forest. Enter Ethwald with a bow in his hand, and a Boy carrying his arrows. Ethw. (looking off the stage). Ha! Alwy, soon return'd! and with him comes My faithful Ongar. Enter Alwy and Ongar with bows also, as if in quest of sport, by the opposite side. Thou comest, Alwy, with a busy face. (To boy.) Go, Boy; I shot mine arrow o'er those elms, Thou'lt find it far beyond. [Exit boy. Now, friend, what tidings? Alwy. Within the tufted centre of the wood The friendly chiefs are met, thus, like ourselves As careless ramblers guised, all to a man Fix'd in your cause. Their followers too are firm; For, much disgusted with the monkish face Their feeble monarch wears, a warlike leader, Far, far inferior to the noble Ethwald, May move them as he lists. Ethw. That time and circumstances on me call Imperiously, I am well assured. Good Ongar, what sayst thou? how thrives thy part Of this important task! Ong. Well as your heart could wish. At the next council, Held in the royal chamber, my good kinsman Commands the guard, and will not bar our way. Ethw. May I depend on this? Ong. You may, my lord. Ethw. Thanks to thee, Ongar! this is noble service, And shall be nobly thank'd. There is, good Alwy, Another point; hast thou unto the chiefs Yet touch'd upon it? Alwy. Yes, and they all agree 'tis most expedient That with Elburga's hand, since weaker minds Are blindly wedded to the royal line, Your right be strengthen'd. Ethw. And this they deem expedient? Alwy. You sigh, my lord; she is, indeed, less gentle— Ethw. Regard it not, it is a passing thought, And it will have its sigh, and pass away. [Turning away for a little space, and then coming forward again. What means hast thou devised, that for a term Selred and Ethelbert may be remov'd? For faithful to the royal line they are, And will not swerve: their presence here were dang'rous: We must employ them in some distant strife. Alwy. I have devis'd a plan, but for the means Brave Ongar here stands pledged. Woggarwolfe, Who once before unweetingly has served us, Will do the same again. Ethw. How so? 'tis said that since his last affray, With the keen torment of his wounds subdu'd, On sick bed laid, by the transforming power Of artful monks, he has become most saintly. Alwy. Well, but we trust his saintship ne'ertheless May still be lur'd to do a sinner's work. To burn the castle of a hateful heretic Will make amends for all his bloody deeds: You catch the plan: nay, Hexulf and his priests Will be our helpmates here. Smile not; good Ongar Has pledged his word for this. Ethw. And I will trust to it. This will, indeed, Draw off the Thanes in haste. But who is near? Skulking behind yon thicket stands a man: Seest thou? [Pointing off the stage. Alwy. Go to him, Ongar, scan him well, And if his face betrays a list'ner's guilt— Thou hast thy dagger there? Ong. Yes, trust me well. Ethw. Nay, Ongar, be not rash in shedding blood! Let not one drop be spilt that may be spar'd. Secure him if he wear a list'ner's face: We are too strong for stern and ruthless caution. [Exit Ongar. I'm glad he is withdrawn a little space, Ere we proceed to join the leagued chiefs. Hast thou agreed with Cuthbert? Is he sure? Alwy. Sure. 'Tis agreed when next the ethling hunts, To lead him in the feigned quest of game From his attendants; there, in ambush laid, Cuthbert and his adherents seize upon him, And will conduct him with the ev'ning's close To Arrick's rugged tower. All is prepar'd. Ethw. But hast thou charged him well that this be done With all becoming care and gentleness, That nothing may his noble nature gall More than the hard necessity compels? Alwy. Do not mistrust us so! your brow is dark: At Edward's name your changing countenance Is ever clouded. [Ethw. turns from him agitated. You are disturb'd, my lord. Ethw. I am disturb'd. (Turning round and grasping Alwy by the hand.) I'll tell thee, Alwy—yes, I am disturb'd— No gleam of glory through my prospect breaks, But still his image, 'thwart the brightness cast, Shades it to night. Alwy. It will be always so: but wherefore should it? Glory is ever bought by those who earn it With loss of many lives most dear and precious. So is it destin'd. Let that be to him Which in the crowded breach or busy field All meet regardless from a foeman's hand. Do the still chamber, and the muflled tread, And th' unseen stroke that doth th' infliction deal, Alter its nature? Ethw. (pushing Alwy away from him vehemently, and putting up both his hands to his head). Forbear! forbear! I shut mine eyes, mine ears; All entrance bar that may into my mind Th' abhorred thing convey. Have I not said, Thou shalt not dare in word, in look, in gesture, In slightest indication of a thought, Hold with my mind such base communication? By my sword's strength! did I not surely think From this bold seizure of the sovereign pow'r, A pow'r for which I must full dearly pay, So says the destiny that o'er me hangs, To shield his weakness and restore again In room of Mercia's crown a nobler sway, Won by my sword, I would as lief—Northumberland Invites my arms, and soon will be subdu'd; Of this full sure, a good amends may be To noble Edward made. Alwy (who during the last part of Ethwald's speech has been smiling behind his back malignantly). O yes, full surely: And wand'ring harpers shall in hall and bower Sing of the marv'llous deed. Ethw. (turning short upon him, and perceiving his smile). Thou smil'st methinks. Full well I read the meaning of that look: 'Tis a fiend's smile, and it will prove a false one. [Turning away angrily, whilst Alwy walks to the bottom of the stage. (Aside, looking suspiciously after him.) Have I offended him? he is an agent Most needful to me. (Aloud, advancing to him.) Good Alwy, anxious minds will often chide— (Aside, stopping short.) He hears me not, or is it but a feint? Alwy (looking off the stage). Your arrow-boy returns. Ethw. (aside, nodding to himself). No, 'tis a free and unoffended voice; I'm wrong. This is a bird whose fleshed beak The prey too strongly scents to fly away: I'll spare my courtesies. (Aloud.) What sayst thou, Alwy? Alwy (pointing). Your arrow-boy. Ethw. I'm glad he is return'd. Re-enter Boy. Boy. Nowhere, my lord, can I the arrow find. Ethw. Well, boy, it matters not; let us move on. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A narrow gallery in an abbey or cloister, with several doors opening into it. Enter Hexulf and Ongar and two monks. Hex. Fear not, brave Ongar, we, upon thy hint, Will quickly act; for here our eager wishes Are with the church's good most closely join'd. 1st monk. This is the time when he should walk abroad. (Listening.) I hear him at his door. Hex. Leave us, good Ongar. Ong. To your good skill I do commit it then; Having but only you, most rev'rend father, To take my part against this wizard Thane. 1st monk (still listening). Begone, he issues forth. [Exit Ongar. [One of the doors opens slowly, and enters Woggarwolfe, wrapped in a cloak, and his head bound. Hex. Good morrow, valiant Thane, whose pious gifts Have won heav'n's grace to renovate thy strength, And grant thee longer life, how goes thy health? Wog. I thank you, rev'rend father, greatly mended. 1st monk. The prayers of holy men have power to save, E'en on the very borders of the tomb, The humbled soul who doth with gifts enrich The holy church. 2d monk. Didst thou not feel within thee A peaceful calm, a cheering confidence, Soon as thy pious offering was accepted? Wog. (hesitating). Yes, rev'rend fathers,—I have thought indeed— Perhaps you meant it so—that since that time The devil has not scar'd me in my dreams So oft as he was wont, when sore with wounds I first was laid upon my bed of pain. Hex. Ay, that is much; but noble Woggarwolfe, Thinkest thou not the church doth merit well Some stable gift, some fix'd inheritance? Thou hast those lands that are so nearly join'd Unto Saint Alban's abbey. Wog. (much surprised). My lands! give up my lands? 1st monk. What are thy lands Compar'd to that which they will purchase for thee? 2d monk. To lay thy coffin'd body in the ground, Rob'd in the garb of holy men, and bless'd? 1st monk. To have thy tomb beneath the shading arch Of sacred roof, where nought profane may enter; While midnight spirits stand and yell without, But o'er the sacred threshold dare not trespass. Wog. (with a rueful countenance). What, do you think I shall be dead so soon? Hex. Life is uncertain; but how glorious, Thane, To look beyond this wicked world of strife, And for thyself a lofty seat provide With saints and holy men, and angel bands! Wog. Nay, father, I am not so highly bent; Do but secure me from the horrid fangs Of the terrific fiend: I am not proud, That will suffice me. Hex. Nay, herein thy humility we praise not, And much I fear, at such a humble pitch, He who so lately scar'd thee in thy dreams May reach thee still. 1st monk. O think of this! Hex. Dreadful it is, thou knowst, To see him in thy dreams; but when awake, Naked, and all uncloth'd of flesh and blood, As thou at last must be; how wilt thou bear To see him yelling o'er thee as his prey; Bearing aloft his dark and hideous form; Grinding his horrid jaws and darting on thee His eyes of vivid fire? [The monks sign themselves with great marks of fear, and Woggarwolfe looks terrified. Ah! thinkst thou, Thane, That many gifts, ay, half of all thou'rt worth, Would dearly purchase safety from such terrors? Wog. (in a quick perturbed voice). I have the plunder of two neighb'ring chiefs, Whom I surprised within their towers and slew; I'll give you all—if that suffices not, I'll fall upon a third, ay, though it were My next of kin, nor spare of all his goods One fragment for myself. O, holy fathers! I humbly crave saintly protection of you. Hex. Nay, Woggarwolfe, on shrines of holy saints No gift ere works with efficacious power By force and violence gain'd; unless, indeed, It be the spoil of some unsaintly Thane, Some faithless wizard or foul heretic. Thou hast a neighbour, impious Ethelbert; His towers to burn and consecrate his spoils, O'er all thy sins would cast a sacred robe, On which nor fiend nor devil durst fix a fang. But now thou lackest strength for such a work, And mayst be dead ere thou hast time to do it: Therefore I counsel thee, give up thy lands. Wog. O, no! I'm strong enough: my men are strong. Give us your rev'rend blessing o'er our heads, And we'll set out forthwith. Hex. Then nothing doubt that on your worthy zeal Will fall the blessing. Let us onward move. Where are thy followers? [Exeunt: Hex. talking busily to Wog., and the monks smiling to one another as they go out. SCENE VI. The royal apartment: the King is discovered with Hexulf, the seneschal, and several friends or councillors, seated round a council table. King (as if continuing to speak). It may be so: youth finds no obstacle, But I am old. Full many a storm on this grey head has beaten; And now, on my high station do I stand, Like the tired watchman in his air-rock'd tower, Who looketh for the hour of his release. I'm sick of worldly broils, and fain would rest With those who war no more. One gleam of light Did sweetly cheer the ev'ning of my day: Edward, my son! he was the kindliest prop That age did ever rest on—he is gone, What should I fight for now? Sen. For thine own honour, for the weal of Mercia, With weapons in our hands, and strong in men, Who to the royal standard soon will flock, If summon'd by thy firm and gen'ral orders. Shall these men be our masters? Heaven forefend! Five thousand warriors might disperse the foe, Even with that devil Ethwald at their head; And shall we think of granting to those rebels Their insolent demands? King. Good seneschal, if that you think our strength Permits us still in open field to strive With hope of good, I am not yet so old But I can brace these stiffen'd limbs in iron, And do a soldier's service. (To 2d coun.) Thane of Mordath, Thy visage light'neth not upon these hopes; What are thy thoughts? 2d coun. E'en that these hopes will bring us to a state Reft of all hope. The rebel chiefs but seek their own enrichment, Not Ethwald's exaltation, good my lord; Bribe them, and treat for peace. Lack you the means? The church, for whose enriching you have rais'd This storm, can well supply it; and most surely Will do it cheerfully. [Turning to Hexulf. Hex. No, by the holy mass! that were to bring The curse of heav'n upon our impious heads. To spoil the holy church is sacrilege: And to advise such spoil in any wise Is sacrilegious and abominable. 1st coun. I am as faithful to the holy church As thou art, angry priest. I do defy thee— Sen. What, have ye no respect unto the king? I do command you, peace. Who now intrudes? Enter a Servant in great terror. Serv. The rebel force! the castle is surprised! They are at hand—they have o'erpower'd the guard. 2d coun. Pray God thou liest! I think it cannot be. [They all rise up alarmed. Serv. It is as true as I do tread this spot. Enter a Soldier wounded. King (to sol.). Ha! what sayst thou? thou bearest for thy words A rueful witness. Sol. Take arms, and save the king, if it be possible. The rebel chieftains have the gate surprised, And gain'd, below, the entrance of this tower. They struggled for the pass; sharp was the broil; This speaks for me, that I have borne my part. [Falls down exhausted. Hex. (to King). Retire, my lord, into the higher chamber. Your arm can give but small assistance here. Until this horrid visit be o'erpast, You may conceal yourself. King. No, father, never shall the king of Mercia Be, from his hiding-place, like a mean man Pull'd forth. But, noble friends, it seems not wise That this necessity should reach to you. These rebels seek my life, and with that life They will be satisfied. In my defence, Thus taken as we are, all stand were useless; Therefore, if now you will obey your king, His last command, retire and save your lives For some more useful end. Finding me here, They will no farther search: retire, my friends. 2d coun. What, leave our king to face his foes alone! King. No, not alone; my friend, the seneschal, Will stay with me. We have been young together, And the same storms in our rough day of life Have beat upon us: be it now God's will, We will lay down our aged heads together In the still rest, and bid good night to strife. Have I said well, my friend? [Holding out his hand to the seneschal. Sen. (kissing his hand with great warmth, and putting one knee to the ground). O my lov'd master! many a bounteous favour Has shower'd upon me from your royal hand, But ne'er before was I so proudly honour'd. [Rising up with assumed grace. Retire, young men, for now I must be proud; Retire, your master will confront the foe As may become a king. (All calling out at once.) No, no! we will not leave him. [They all range themselves, drawing their swords, round the King, and the old seneschal stands, by pre-eminence, close to his master's side. 2d coun. Here is a wall through which they first must force A bloody way, ere on his royal head One silver hair be scath'd. Enter Ethwald, Alwy, and the Conspirators. Alwy. Now vengeance for injustice and oppression! 2d coun. On your own heads, then, be it, miscreant chiefs! [They fight round the King; his party defend him bravely, till many more conspirators enter, and it is overpowered. Ethw. (aside, angrily, to Alwy, on still seeing the King, standing in the midst, unhurt, and with great dignity, the seneschal by his side, and no one offering to attack him). Hast thou forgot? Where are thy chosen men? Is there no hand to do the needful work? This is but children's play. (To some of his party.) Come, let us search, that in the neighb'ring chamber No lurking foe escape. [Exit with some followers. Alwy (giving a sign to his followers, and going up insolently to the King). Oswal, resign thy sword. Sen. First take thou mine, thou base, ignoble traitor! [Giving Alwy a blow with his sword; upon which Alwy and his followers fall upon the King and the seneschal, and surrounding them on every side, kill them, with many wounds, the crowd gathering so close round them, that their fall cannot be seen. Re-enter Ethwald, and the crowd opening on each side shows the dead bodies of the King and the Seneschal. Ethw. (affecting surprise). What sight is this? Ah! ye have gone too far. Who did this deed? Alwy. My followers, much enraged at slight offence, Did fall upon him. Ethw. All have their end decreed, and this, alas! Has been his fated hour. Come, chiefs and valiant friends, why stand we here Looking on that which cannot be repair'd? All honour shall be paid unto the dead. And, were this deed of any single hand The willing crime, he should have vengeance too But let us now our task of night fulfil: Much have we still to do ere morning dawn. [Exeunt Ethw. and followers, and the scene closes. SCENE VII. A royal apartment: Enter Elburga, with her hair scattered upon her shoulders, and with the action of one in violent grief, followed by Dwina, who seems to be soothing her. Elb. Cease, cease! thy foolish kindness soothes me not; My morning is o'ercast; my glory sunk; Leave me alone to wring my hands and weep. Dwi. O no, my princely mistress! grieve not thus! Over our heads the blackest clouds do pass And brighter follow them. Elb. No, no, my sky is night! I was a princess, Almost a queen: in gorgeous pomp beheld, The public gaze was ever turn'd on me; Proud was the highest Thane or haughtiest dame To do my bidding, ev'ry count'nance watch'd Each changeful glance of my commanding eye, To read its meaning: now my state is chang'd: Scoffing and insult and degrading pity Abide the daughter of a murder'd king. Heaven's vengeance light upon them all! Begone! I hate the very light for looking on me! Begone! and soothe me not! Dwi. Forgive me, princess; do not thus despair; King Oswal's daughter many friends will find. Elb. Friends! hold thy peace!—Oh it doth rend my heart! I have been wont to talk of subjects, vassals, Dependants, servants, slaves, but not of friends. Where shall I hide my head? Dwi. Surely, dear mistress, with Saint Cuthbert's nuns, Whose convent by your father's gifts is rich, You will protection find. There quiet rest, And holy converse of those pious maids, After a while will pour into your mind Soft consolation. [Putting her hands on Elburga 's soothingly. Elb. (pushing her away). Out upon thee, fool! Go, speak thy comforts To spirits tame and abject as thyself: They make me mad; they make me thus to tear My scatter'd locks and strew them to the winds. [Tearing her hair distractedly. Enter a Servant. (To ser.) What brings thee here? Ser. Ethwald, the king, is at the gate, and asks To be admitted to your presence, princess. Elb. (becoming suddenly calm). What, Ethwald, sayst thou? sayst thou truly so? Ser. Yes, truly, princess. Elb. Ethwald, that Thane whom thou dost call the king? Ser. Yes, he whom all the states and chiefs of Mercia Do call the king. Elb. He enters not. Tell him I am unwell, And will not be disturb'd. [Exit ser. What seeks he here? Fie, poorly fainting soul! Rouse! rouse thee up! To all the world beside Subdued and humbled would I rather be Than in the eyes of this proud man. Re-enter Servant. What sayst thou? Is he departed? Ser. No, he will not depart, but bids me say The entrance he has begg'd he now commands. I hear his steps behind me. Enter Ethwald. Elburga turns away from him proudly. Ethw. Elburga, turn and look upon a friend. Elb. (turning round haughtily, and looking on him with an assumed expression of anger and scornful contempt). Usurping rebel, who hast slain thy master; Take thou a look that well beseems thy worth, And hie thee hence, false traitor! Ethw. Yes, I will hie me hence, and with me lead A fair and beauteous subject to my will; That will which may not be gainsaid. For now High heaven, that hath decreed thy father's fall, Hath also me appointed king of Mercia, With right as fair as his: which I'll maintain And by the proudest in this lordly realm Will be obey'd, even by thy lofty self. Elb. Put shackles on my limbs and o'er my head Let your barr'd dungeons low'r; then mayst thou say, “Walk not abroad,” and so it needs must be: But thinkst thou to subdue, bold as thou art, The lofty spirit of king Oswal's daughter? Go, bind the wild winds in thy hollow shield, And bid them rage no more: they will obey thee. Ethw. Yes, proud Elburga, I will shackle thee. But on the throne of Mercia shalt thou sit, Not in the dungeon's gloom. Ay, and albeit the wild winds refuse To be subjected to my royal will, The lofty spirit of king Oswal's daughter I will subdue. (Taking her hand.) Elb. (throwing him off from her vehemently). Off with those bloody hands that slew my father! Thy touch is horrid to me! 'tis a fiend's grasp: Out from my presence! bloody Thane of Mairnieth! Ethw. Ay! frown on me, Elburga; proudly frown: I knew thy haughty spirit, and I lov'd it, Even when I saw thee first in gorgeous state; When, bearing high thy stately form, thou stoodst Like a proud queen, and on the gazing crowd, Somewhat offended with a late neglect, Darted thy looks of anger and disdain. High Thanes and dames shrank from thine eye, whilst I, Like one who from the mountain's summit sees, Beneath him far the harmless lightning play, With smiling admiration mark'd thee well, And own'd a kindred soul. Each angry flash Of thy dark eye was loveliness to me. But know, proud maid, my spirit outmasters thine, And heedeth not the anger nor the power Of living thing. Elb. Bold and amazing man! Ethw. And bold should be the man who weds Elburga. Elb. Away! it cannot be, it shall not be! My soul doth rise against thee, bloody chief, And bids thy power defiance. Ethw. Then art thou mine in truth, for never yet Did hostile thing confront me unsubdued; Defy me and thou'rt conquer'd. Elb. Thou most audacious chief! it shall not be. Ethw. It shall, it must be, maiden, I have sworn it; And here repeat it on that beauteous hand Which to no power but with my life I'll yield [Grasping her hand firmly, which she struggles to free. Frown not, Elburga! 'tis in vain to strive; My spirit outmasters thine. Elb. Sayst thou to me thou didst not slay my father? Sayst thou those hands are guiltless of his death? Ethw. Thinkst thou I'll plead, and say I have not slain A weak old man, whose inoffensive mind, And strong desire to quit the warring world For quiet religious rest, could be, in truth, No hindrance to my greatness? were this fitting In Mercia's king, and proud Elburga's lord? Elb. (turning away). Elburga's lord? Thou art presumptuous, prince: Go hence, and brave me not. Ethw. I will go hence forthwith; and, by my side, The fair selected partner of my throne I'll lead, where the assembled chiefs of Mercia Wait to receive from me their future queen. Elb. Distract me not! Ethw. Resistance is distraction. Who ever yet my fixed purpose cross'd? Did Ethwald ever yield? Come, queen of Mercia! This firm grasp shall conduct thee to a throne: [Taking her hand, which she feebly resists. Come forth, the frowning, haughty bride of Ethwald. Elb. Wonderful man! If hell or fortune fight for thee I know not, Nothing withstands thy power. [Exeunt: Ethw. leading off Elb. in triumph, and Dwina following, with her hands and eyes raised to heaven in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An arched passage from a gateway in the royal castle. The sound of warlike music without. Enter Ethelbert and Selred with their followers, as if just come from a long march: enter, by the opposite side, Alwy, upon which they halt, the foremost of the followers but just appearing under the gateway. Alwy. Welcome, most valiant chieftains! Fame reports That crown'd with full success ye are return'd. Eth. Good sooth, we boast but little of our arms; Though Woggarwolfe, our base ignoble spoiler, Wounded and sorely shent, we've left behind, Again in cloister'd walls with ghostly men, Winding his soul, with many a heavy groan, Into a saintly frame! God speed the work! We are but just in time to save our halls. Sel. It is a shame that such a ruffian thief Should thus employ the arms of warlike Thanes. Alwy. In truth it is, but now there reigns in Mercia A warlike king, who better knows to deal With valiant men. The messenger inform'd you? Sel. He did; yet, be it own'd, to call him king Sounds strangely in our ears. How died king Oswal? Eth. (to Sel.) Patience, my friend! good time will show thee all. Yet pray inform us, Alwy, ere we part, Where is young Edward? in these late commotions What part had he? Alwy. Would to the holy saints I could inform you! Reports there are, incongruous and absurd— Some say, in hunting from his followers stray'd, Passing at dusk of eve a high-swoln stream, Therein he perish'd; others do maintain That, loathing greatness, he conceals himself In some lone cave: but as I bear a heart True to King Ethwald and the public weal, I know of him no more. Sel. Thou liest! Eth. (pulling back Sel.) Peace, art thou mad? Alwy (pretending not to hear). What said brave Selred? Eth. A hasty exclamation of no meaning. Alwy. I must away, and bear the welcome tidings Of your arrival to the royal ear. Eth. But stop, before thou goest I fain would know How fared Elburga in the passing storm? Where has she refuge found? Alwy. Within these walls; she is the queen of Mercia. Eth. I am indebted to thee. [Exit Alwy. Sel. (staring with surprise upon Ethelbert). What dost thou think of this? Did we hear truly? To the usurper of her father's crown, And, if our fears be true, his murd'rer too! To him! O most unnatural! Eth. Ay, so it is. As one, who ventures forth After an earthquake's awful visitation, The country round in strange unwonted guise Beholds; here swelling heights and herby knolls, Where smok'd the cottage and the white flocks browz'd, Sunk into turbid pools; there rifted rocks, With all their shaggy woods upon their sides, In the low bosom of the flowery vale Resting uncouthly—even so does he, Who looks abroad after the storms of state, Strange changes see; unnatural and strange. Sel. It makes my spirit boil—the gentle Edward! So gently brave! Eth. Yes, there is cause of grief And indignation too: but Ethwald reigns, Howe'er he gain'd his height, and he possesses The qualities that suit his lofty station. With them I fear he has his passions also, Hostile to public good: be it our part To use the influence we still retain O'er his ambitious mind for Mercia's weal! This is our duty now. Sel. I'll take thy counsel. (To the soldiers.) Follow, weary comrades. [Exeunt Eth. and Sel. and their followers, marching across the stage. SCENE II. A royal apartment. Elburga, as queen, discovered sitting on a chair of state, with Dwina, ladies, and officers of state attending. Elb. We've waited long: how goes the day? knowst thou? (To 1st officer.) 1st off. As comes the light across this arched roof From those high windows, it should wear, methinks, Upon noon-day. Elb. And the procession to the royal chapel Should at this hour begin. The king, perchance, Is with affairs detain'd: go thou and see. [Exit 1st officer. I am impatient now. [Voice heard without. What voice is that? First SONG without. Hark! the cock crows, and the wind blows, Away, my love, away! Quick, don thy weeds and tell thy beads, For soon it will be day. 1st lady. 'Tis sadly wild. Dwi. 'Tis sad, but wondrous sweet. Who may it be? List, list! she sings again. Second SONG without. Where layst thou thy careless head? On the cold heath is my bed, Where the moor-cock shuts his wing, And the brown snake weaves his ring. Safe and fearless will I be, The coiled adder stings not me. Elb. (rising, displeased, from her seat). Call those who wait without. What may this mean? Enter an Attendant. Whose voice is that which in a day of joy Such plaintive music makes? Atten. Pardon, my royal dame! be not offended! 'Tis a poor maid bereaved of her mind. Rent are her robes, her scatter'd locks unbound, Like one who long through rugged ways hath stray'd, Beat with the surly blast; but never yet, Though all so sorely shent, did I behold A fairer maid. She aims at no despite: She's wild, but gentle. Dwi. O hark again! Third SONG without. For this third song, which is the only literary assistance either in verse or prose that I have ever received, I am indebted to the pen of a friend. Once upon my cheek He said the roses grew, But now they're wash'd away With the cold ev'ning dew. For I wander through the night, When all but me take rest, And the moon's soft beams fall piteously Upon my troubled breast. [A pause. Fourth SONG. Ah, maiden! bear the biting smart, Nor thus thy loss deplore; The Thane's fair daughter has his heart, He will return no more. 1st lady. 'Tis strangely melancholy. Dwi. 'Tis like the mournful sounds which oftentimes The midnight watcher, in his lonely tower, Hears with the wailing blast most sweetly mingled. Elb. (to attendant). Go thou and lead her hither. Atten. I will, great queen.—But here she comes unbidden. Enter Bertha, with a wild unsettled air, and her hair scattered upon her shoulders. The ladies gather about her with curiosity. 1st lady. How fair she is! 2d lady. Her eyes of lovely blue, Gentle, but restless. Dost thou see that glance? [To 1st lady. I fear to look upon her. Dwi. Fie, fie upon it! press not near her thus; She seems offended: I will speak to her. (To Berth.) Sweet lady, art thou sad? [Bertha looks steadfastly at her, then drops her head upon her breast, and makes no answer. We would be kind to thee. [Berth. then looks more gently on her, but is still silent. 1st lady. Dost thou not speak, thou who canst sing so well? Dwi. Who taught thee those sweet notes? Berth. The night was dark: I met spirits on my way: They sang me sweet songs, but they were sorrowful. Dwi. Ah, woe is me! and dost thou wander then, In the dark night alone, no one to tend thee? Berth. When the moon's dark, I follow the night-bird's cry, And it doth guide my way.—But he'll return, So do they tell me, when sweet violets blow, And summer comes again. Dwi. And who is he? Berth. List, and the winds will tell thee as they pass: The stilly air will whisper it. But softly, Tell it to none again. They must not know How stern he is, for he was gentle once. Dwi. A cruel heart had he who could forsake thee! Ber. (putting her hand eagerly on Dwina's mouth). Hush, hush! we'll not offend him. He is great, And must not be offended. Elb. (coming near her). What, sayst thou he is great? Rent are thy weeds, and thin thy ruffled robe: Why didst thou leave thy home thus unprotected? Ber. (turning hastily upon her). I saw his banner streaming in the air, And I did follow it. Elb. His banner in the air! What is thy love? Berth. (looking fiercely at her). They say he is a king. Elb. (smiling). Poor maid! 'tis ever thus with such as she; They still believe themselves of some high state, And mimic greatness. Berth. Thou art a fair dame and a gay—but go; Take off thine eyes from me; I love thee not. [Shrinks from Elburga, walking backwards, and looking frowningly at her; then beckoning to Dwina, she speaks in her ear. They say a royal dame has won his faith, Stately and proud. But in a gloomy dream I heard it first, confused and terrible: And oftimes, since, the fiend of night repeats it, As on my pressed breast he sits and groans. I'll not believe it. Dwi. What is thy name, sweet lady? Berth. (rubbing her hand across her forehead as if trying to recollect). I had a name that kind friends call'd me by; And with a blessing did the holy man Bestow it on me. But I've wander'd far Through wood and wilds, and strangely on my head The numbing winds have beat, and I have lost it. Be not offended with me— For, lady, thou art gentle, and I fear thee. [Bowing submissively to Dwina. Enter Ethelbert. Eth. (to Dwina, after looking at Bertha). What maid is that so haggard and so wild? Dwi. A wand'ring maniac, but so fair and gentle Thou needs must speak to her. Eth. (going up to Bertha). Fair lady, wilt thou suffer—gracious heaven! What see I here! the sweet and gentle Bertha! Ah, has it come to this! Alas, alas! Sweet maiden, dost thou know me? Berth. (after looking earnestly at him). I know thee well enough. They call thee mad; Thy wild and raving words oft made the ears Of holy men to tingle. Eth. She somewhat glances at the truth. Alas! I've seen her gay and blooming as the rose, And cheerful, too, as song of early lark, I've seen her prattle on her nurse's lap, Innocent bud! and now I see her thus. [Weeps. Berth. Ah! dost thou weep? are they unkind to thee? [Shaking her head. Yes, yes! from out the herd, like a mark'd deer, They drive the poor distraught. The storms of heaven Beat on him: gaping hinds stare at his woe; And no one stops to bid heav'n speed his way. Eth. (flourish of trumpets). Sweet maid, retire. Berth. Nay, nay! I will not go: there be without Those who will frown upon me. Eth. (endeavouring to lead her off). I pray thee be entreated! [Dwina takes hold of her also to lead her off, but she breaks from them furiously. Berth. Ye shall not force me! Wist ye who I am? The whirlwind in its strength contends with me, And I o'ermaster it. Eth. Stand round her then, I pray you, gentle ladies! The king must not behold her. [The ladies gather round Bertha, and conceal her. Enter Ethwald, followed by Thanes and Attendants. Ethw. (after returning the obeisance of the assembly). This gay and fair attendance on our person, And on our queen, most honour'd lords and dames, We much regard; and could my heart express— [Bertha, hearing his voice, shrieks out. What cry is that? Dwi. Regard it not: it is a wand'ring maid, Distracted in her mind, who is in search, As she conceits it, of some faithless lover. She sings sweet songs of wildest harmony, And at the queen's command we led her in. Ethw. Seeking her love! distracted in her mind! Have any of my followers wrong'd her? Speak! If so it be, by righteous heaven I swear! The man, whoe'er he be, shall dearly rue it. [Bertha shrieks again, and, breaking through the crowd, runs up to Ethwald. He starts back, and covers his eyes with one hand, whilst she, catching hold of the other, presses it to her breast. Berth. I've found thee now, and let the black fiend growl, I will not part with thee. I've follow'd thee Through crag and moor and wild. I've heard thy voice Sound from the dark hill's side, and follow'd thee. I've seen thee on the gath'ring twilight clouds, Ride with the stately spirits of the storm. But thou lookst sternly on me. O be not angry! I will kneel to thee; For thou art glorious now, as I am told, And must have worship. (Kneeling, and bowing her head meekly to the ground.) Ethw. (turning away). O God! O God! Where art thou, Ethelbert? Thou mightst have saved me this. [Looking round, and seeing that Ethelbert weeps, he also becomes softened, and turns to Bertha with great emotion. Berth. They say she's fair and glorious: woe is me! I am but form'd as simple maidens are. But scorn me not; I have a powerful spell, A Druid gave it me, which on mine arm When once enclasp'd, will make me fair as she; So thou wilt turn to me. Ethw. O Ethelbert! I pray thee pity me! This sight doth move me, e'en to agony. Remove her hence; but O deal gently with her! [Ethelbert endeavours again to lead her off, and the ladies crowd about her. She is then carried out, and is heard to scream as they are carrying her. Ethw. (in great disorder). Come, come away! we do but linger here. [Elburga, who, since Ethwald 's entering, has remained in the background, but agitated with passions, now advances angrily to him Elb. So thou hast known this maid? Ethw. Fie! speak not to me now. Elb. Away, away! Thou hast lodg'd softer passions in thy breast Than I have reckon'd on. Ethw. (shaking her off). Fie! turn thy face aside, and shade thine eyes! That no soft passion in thy bosom lives, Is thy opprobrium, woman, and thy shame. Elb. There are within my breast such thoughts, I trust, As suit my lofty state. Ethw. (aside to Elb.) Go, heartless pageant, go, Lead on thy senseless show, and move me not To do thee some despite. (Aloud to the ladies.) Move on, fair dames. [To Elb., who seems unwilling to go. The king commands it. [Exeunt Elburga and ladies. 1st off. (to Ethw., who stands with his eyes fixed on the ground). Please you, my lord, but if you move not also, The ceremony will, in sooth, appear As marr'd and cut in twain. Ethw. What sayst thou, marshal? 1st off. Please you, my lord, to move? Ethw. Ay, thou sayst well: in the soul's agony A meaner man might turn aside and weep. [Exit Ethw. with part of his train, the others ranging themselves in order to follow him. A great confusion and noise is then heard without, and a voice calling out “The king is wounded.” The crowd press back again in disorder, and presently re-enter Ethw. supported. 1st off. My lord, how is it with you? Ethw. I fear but ill, my friend. Where is the man That gave me this fell stroke? 1st off. I cannot tell: they have surrounded him. Enter 2d Officer. 2d off. He is secured. Ethw. Is it a Mercian hand? 2d off. It is, my lord, but of no high degree. It is the frantic stroke of a poor groom, Who did his late lord love; and, for that crime, Last night, with wife and children weeping round him, Was by your soldiers turn'd into the cold, Houseless and bare. Ethw. Curse on their ruffian zeal! Torment him not, but let him die in peace. Would I might say—. I'm very faint, my friends: Support me hence, I pray you! [Exeunt, Ethw. supported. SCENE III. A royal apartment: an open door in front, showing an inner chamber, in which is discovered Ethwald lying upon a couch, and surrounded with the Thanes and Officers of his court, Selred and Ethelbert standing on each side of him. Sel. (after Ethw. has said something to him in a low voice). He is too much inclosed and longs for air: He'll breathe more freely in the outer chamber, Let us remove him. [They lift him in his couch, and bring him forward to the front of the stage. 1st off. How are you now, my lord? Ethw. Somewhat exhausted: and albeit, good Thanes, I greatly am indebted to your love, For a short space I fain would be alone. 1st off. Farewell! God send your highness rest! meantime We'll pray for your recovery. 2d off. And heaven will hear our prayers. Omnes. Amen, amen! Ethw. Pray heaven to order all things for the weal Of my good realm, and I shall be well pleased To live or die. Adieu! [Exeunt all but Ethw., Selred, and Ethelbert. After a pause, in which Ethw. seems agitated and uneasy. My dearest Selred, think it not unkind, But go thou too. [Exit Selred. [Raising himself on the couch, and taking both the hands of Ethelbert, which he presses in his, looking up in his face expressively for some time before he speaks. I am oppress'd. To them, even in this state, I still must be a king: to you, my friend, Let me put off all seeming and constraint, And be a poor weak man. (A pause.) Thou speakest not, Thy face is sad and solemn. Well I see Thou lookst upon me as a dying wretch— There is no hope. Eth. Much will it profit thee To be prepared as though there were no hope; For if thou liv'st thou'lt live a better man, And if thou diest, may heav'n accept it of thee! Ethw. O that it would! But, my good Ethelbert, To be thus seized in my high career, With all my views of glory op'ning round me— The Western state e'en now invites mine arms. And half Northumberland, in little time, Had been to Mercia join'd. Eth. Nay, think not now, I pray thee, of these matters! They mix uncouthly with the pious thoughts That do become your state. Ethw. I know it well; But they do press so closely on my heart— O I did think to be remember'd long! Like those grand visitations of the earth, That on its alter'd face for ages leave The traces of their might. Alas, alas! I am a powerful, but a passing storm, That soon shall be forgotten! Eth. I do beseech thee think of better things! Ethw. Thou seest I weep.—Before thee I may weep. [Dropping his head upon his breast, and groaning deeply. Long have I toil'd and stain'd my hands in blood To gain pre-eminence; and now, alas! Newly arrived at this towering height, With all my schemes of glory rip'ning round me, I close mine eyes in darkness, and am nothing. Eth. What, nothing sayst thou? Ethw. O no, Ethelbert! I look beyond this world, and look with dread, Where all for me is fearful and unknown. Death I have daily braved in fields of fight, And, when a boy, oft on the air-hung bough I've fearless trod, beneath me roaring far The deep swoln floods, with every erring step Instant destruction. Had I perish'd then— Would that I had, since it is come to this! [Raising up his hands vehemently to heaven. Eth. Be not so vehement: this will endanger The little chance thou still mayst have for life. The God we fear is merciful. Ethw. Ay, He is merciful; but may it reach— O listen to me!—Oswal I have murder'd, And Edward, brave and gentle—ay, this bites With a fell tooth!—I vilely have enthrall'd; Of all his rights deprived. The loving Bertha: Too well thou knowst what I have been to her— Ah! thinkest thou a thousand robed priests Can pray down mercy on a soul so foul? Eth. The inward sighs of humble penitence Rise to the ear of heav'n, when pealed hymns Are scatter'd with the sounds of common air; If I indeed may speak unto a king Of low humility. Ethw. Thy words bite keenly, friend. O king me not! Grant me but longer life, and thou shalt see What brave amends I'll make for past offences. Thou thinkest hardly of me; ne'ertheless, Rough as my warrior's life has been, good thoughts Have sometimes harbour'd here. [Putting his hand on his heart. If I had lived, It was my full intent that, in my power, My people should have found prosperity: I would have proved to them a gen'rous lord. If I had lived—Ah! thinkst thou, Ethelbert, There is indeed no hope? Eth. I may not flatter you. Ethw. (holding up his clasped hands). Then heaven have mercy on a guilty soul! Good Ethelbert, full well thou knowst that I No coward am: from power of mortal thing I never shrank. O might I still contend With spear and helm, and shield and brandish'd blade! But I must go where spear and helm and shield Avail not: Where the skill'd warrior, cased in iron, stands Defenceless as the poor uncrusted worm. Some do conceit that disembodied spirits Have in them more capacity of woe Than flesh and blood maintain. I feel appall'd: Yes, Thane of Sexford, I do say appall'd. For, ah! thou knowst not in how short a space The soul of man within him may be changed. Eth. I know it all too well. But be more calm; Thou hast a task to do, and short perhaps May be the time allow'd thee. True repentance With reparation of offences past Is ever yok'd. Declare it as thy will That Edward do succeed unto his rights: And for poor Bertha, she shall be my charge; I'll tend and cheer her in my quiet home. Ethw. Thou dost prevent my boon: heaven bless thee for it! I give thee power to do whate'er thou thinkst I living should have done. 'Tis all I can, And gracious heaven accept it at my hands! Eth. Amen, my friend! I'll faithfully fulfil The important trust—Ha! how thy visage changes! Thy mind's exertion has outrun thy strength. He faints away. Help! who attends without? Enter Selred with Attendants. Support the king: whether a sudden faint Or death be now upon him, trow I not, But quickly call the queen. Sel. Alas, my brother! [Assisting Eth. to raise Ethw.'s head. Eth. Raise him gently, Selred. For, if that life within him still remain, It may revive him. Sel. Ah, see how changed he is! Alas, my brother! Pride of my father's house, is this thy end? Enter Elburga, Nobles, &amp;c. Elb. Let me approach unto my royal lord. Good Ethelbert, thou long hast known thy king, Look'd he e'er thus before? [Looking on Ethw. Eth. No, royal dame; and yet 'tis but a faint; See, he revives again. Ethw. (opening his eyes). Who are about me now? Eth. The queen and nobles. Sel. And Selred, too, is here, my dearest Ethwald! Ethw. (holding out his hand to Sel.) Ay, noble brother, thou wert ever kind. Faintness returns again; stand round, my friends, And hear my dying words. It is my will That Ethelbert shall, after my decease, With the concurrence of the nation's council, The kingdom settle as may best appear To his experienced wisdom, and retain Until that settlement the kingly power. Faintness returns again; I say no more. Art thou displeas'd, my Selred? Sel. (kneeling and kissing his hand). No, brother, let your dying will bereave me E'en of my father's lands, and with my sword I will maintain it. Ethw. Thou art a gen'rous brother; fare thee well! Elb. What, is the queen, indeed, so poor a thing In Mercia's state that she should be o'erpass'd, Unhonour'd and unmention'd? Ethw. (to Elb., waving his hand faintly). Be at peace! Thou shalt have all things that become thy state. (To attendants.) Lower my head, I pray you. 1st off. He faints again. 2d off. He will not hold it long: The kingdom will be torn with dire contentions. And the Northumbrian soon will raise his head. Ethw. (raising himself eagerly with great vehemence). Northumberland! Oh I did purpose soon, With thrice five thousand of my chosen men, To have compass'd his proud towers. Death, death! thou art at hand, and all is ended! [Groans, and falls back upon the couch. 1st off. This is a faint from which I fear, brave Thanes, He will awake no more. 2d off. Sayst thou? go nearer and observe the face. 1st off. If that mine eyes did ever death behold, This is a dead man's visage. 2d off. Let us retire. My good lord Ethelbert, You shall not find me backward in your service. 1st off. Nor me. Omnes. Nor any of us. Eth. I thank you, Thanes! 'Tis fit you should retire; But Selred and myself, and, of your number, Two chosen by yourselves, will watch the body. [To Dwina, who supports Elburga, and seems soothing her. Ay, gentle Dwina, soothe your royal mistress, And lead her hence. [After looking steadfastly on the body. Think ye, indeed, that death hath dealt his blow? 1st off. Ah, yes, my lord! that countenance is death! [Selred kneels by the body, and hides his head. Eth. Then peace be to his spirit! A brave and daring soul is gone to rest. Thus powerful death th' ambitious man arrests, In midst of all his great and towering hopes, With heart high swoln; as the omnipotent frost Seizes the rough enchafed northern deep, And all its mighty billows, heav'd aloft, Boldly commixing with the clouds of heaven, Are fix'd to rage no more.
