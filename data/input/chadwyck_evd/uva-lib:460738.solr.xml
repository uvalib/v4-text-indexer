      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. MEN. Glenelg, a Bridegroom. Ronaldsey, his Friend. Caluthan, a Hermit. Beneild, a Chieftain. Friar, Confessor to Lady Beneild. FEMALES. Marina, A Sea-Nymph. Agandel, the Bride of Glenelg. Lady Beneild, Mother to Beneild. Elpa, a malformation. The Scene lies in the Islands of Iona, Mull, and Stuffa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Gate of the Monastery of Iona. Glenelg, Agandel, Ronaldsey, and Attendants. Ronaldsey. The gale blows gently, and the rippling sea Rejoices in the cheerful morning's smile, And lifts in flickering dance its summer waves To welcome back the radiant god of day. Come now, Glenelg, with thy fair bride descend, To where, soft-moving on the ocean's breast, Like a rich trinket on the heaving bosom Of some expecting maid, the vessel swings Held by her slend'rest cable. Lady, come, Blest by the priest and that accorded love Which gives the assurance of a happy race. Agandel. The tide scarce serves. Let us awhile delay, Till the returning flow hath sooth'd the rage Of the dread Corry-vrakenâWhat may chance, Strikes fearful chill into my inmost spirit; For I have heard that not the secret rocks, Nor the tumultuous whirling of the waves, Are half so fatal to the passing bark, As fraudful creatures that inhabit there, Who with the social human countenance Smiling allure, or feigning drowning cries Draw kind and pitiable hearts so far Into the sweeping vortex of the gulf, That they must perish, and become their prey. Glenelg. Be not afraid of such; more cause have we To dread the malice of the proud Beneild, In whose vindictive breast the bitter thought Of this blest voyage, that has made thee mine, May urge to plot some treacherous enterprize Against our safe return. My love, thy hand; Let us not linger, but in wisdom haste To the safe refuge of my father's hall, While yet the gentle breezes of the morn Breathe thus propitiously to waft us home. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Hall in Beneild's Castle. Lady Beneild and her Son. Lady Ben. To scorn Beneild and take the soft Glenelg! It is an insult, boy, to all our clan, And if thou hast the temper of thy race, Thou wilt not patiently endure this wrong. Had I the magic of the old witch Elpa, There's not a mischief in the earth or air That should remain uncall'd to do them harm. Beneild. And who is Elpa? Often have I heard Our men, when gather'd round the hearth at night, With cautious voice and wary look, relate How she was wont, in former times, to vex The whole extent and borders of the isle. Lady Ben. Now she is old, and seldom stirs abroad. None ever knew her country or her kin. When first the playful children saw her come, They ran to mock her hump'd unshapen form, But when she fix'd on them her fiery eyes, Their mirth was marr'd, and, with their hands behind, Fearing her touch, they silent look'd at her. Beneild. Is she indeed so hideous and so grim? Lady Ben. She is a haggard and decrepid thing, Scarce taller than a two years' tottering child: Her wither'd visage is so sharp and lean That without eyes it would bespeak her fell; And yet her quick and sparklike eyes appear So kindled with malign intelligence, That all the other features of her face Are seen no more by those on whom she looks, Such is their evil darting.âBut her eyes Are far less dreadful than her lean large hands, So gnarl'd with bone, and shrivell'd without veins, That they do seem like a dead giant's, dried In some cadav'ry of that fab'lous land Where once the Cyclops dwelt. Frequent at eve, Ere yet the twilight has entirely faded, With soundless tread she seeks the cotter's door, And moaning sullenly, puts in her hand, And holds it till the trembling dame within Has pil'd it full, or emptied all the store Kept for the supper of her weary spouse, Expected from the field. Sometimes, when late The traveller hastens o'er the lonely moor, His horse stops suddenly, and startled turns From something slowly bowling in the road: 'Tis Elpa crippling homeward with her alms. Beneild. Where is her home? Lady Ben. 'Tis said in some hid cave, Not far beyond the cottage on the shore.â Once in that cottage liv'd a good old man, Who with hard labor, care, and pious thoughts, A son and daughter bred to industry, Till they were blighted by her treacherous gifts.â Three days and nights the winds had fiercely blown, And high above the rocks where Elpa dwells, The angry waves, in lavish sheets of foam, Dash'd without intermission. On the fourth The wind abated, and at set of sun Nought but the noiseless swell and wreck of barks Strew'd on the shore, reminded of the storm. The good old man, his children kneeling near, In his accustom'd way the Bible took, And, on a stone before his cottage door, Began his evening prayer, when he descried The shrunken Elpa looking o'er the book, And heard her shrilly say, âGive me to eat.â He trembling rose, leaving his prayer unsaid, And granted her request. The following morn, A rich reward of antique gold was found Piled on the stone; alas! an unblest gift! Beneild. Yet it denoted gratitude in her. Lady Ben. Gifts from all such do but entail misfortune. Her gold brought idleness. The good old man Fell into foul intemperance; his son Wander'd away into the Saxon land, And children that could claim no father's care, With shame and sorrow broke the daughter's heart. Beneild. Would that the witch might some such gift bestow On scornful Agandel. Lady Ben. Where now, Beneild? Beneild. To speak with Elpa, and to see her power In aid of my revenge. Lady Ben. What have I said, That thou wouldst tempt misfortune to thyself By any traffic with a witch accurst. Stay, headstrong boy, thy wild intent forego. [Exit. SCENE III. The Cave of Elpa. Elpa, sola. Again the gaudy sun looks o'er the waves, And draws the night from my deformity. Once on a cloudless morn methought I saw Some interposing darkness grateful close Upon his odious light, while all the face Of universal nature seem'd to sadden; The birds sat mute, but I had sense of joy. Yet soon th'eclipse, like an unsettled eyelid, Opening remov'd, and all again grew gay, Stirring my grief anew. Ha! who is this, With knotted brow, and dark, distemper'd eyes? What spiteful mission brings the pale wretch here? [Enter Beneild.] Beneild. This must be her abode. What precious hoards And gorgeous remnants of rich merchandize, From shipwreck sav'd, lie gather'd useless here, As if in spite from the bright world withheld. But in what murky corner of the cave Sits she herself? Elpa. What wouldst thou here with me? Beneild. Ha! hideous toad! Elpa. What wouldst thou here? Beneild. 'Tis she! Unhappy creature, thou wilt pardon me, For fearful apprehension of strange things That from the tide crawl into dens like this, Troubled my fancy, and my sight perplex'd By the fantastic lustre of these gems, Discern'd thee not. Elpa. But thou didst grin at me, And started back, as if thine eyes beheld Some devilish aggregate of spite and venom. But, dog, I can endureâfor from my birth, Malicious Nature has made me abhorr'd: My mother loath'd me and denied her breast; And I had perish'd ere I knew to suffer, But for the thankless care of a curs'd monk, Who fed my crave, and rear'd me into strength: That he might know what metaphysics work In such a monstrous ill-assorted frame. But I forsook him, and hid in the heaps Of a rude lading which a bark brought hence, Came, four-score years ago, into this isle, And made this cave my home. In all that time No living creature dared to enter here, Save once, a hound, and I tore out his eyes. But now 'tis known that I begin to fail, And the quick-sighted eagles, floating near, Oft mark me for their prey. Beneild. But I have come Not to molest thee, but to ask thy aidâ Elpa. Ha! dost thou mock me? helpless as I am, What aid can I bestow?âNever before Did mortal being ask my rugged service. Dost thou lack gold? or hast some silly maid, Whom thou would'st win by hanging at her ear Th'impearled humor of a wounded shell? There, gather, gather; and make haste away. Beneild. Nay, be not wroth with me; I want not theseâ Not ornaments, to draw the eye to beauty; But, harken, cunning to defeat its charms. See'st thou yon bark, with twining streamers, flying Before the fav'ring breeze delighted coming, The crystal ocean into sparkles braying Beneath her stately prow. Elpa. What then, what then? Beneild. Hast thou no art to stop her gay career? No friendly power that dwells high in the air Whom thou canst charm to mount his cloudy car, And breathe tempestuous mischief on that bark? Elpa. Wast thou insulted, that thou art malicious? I see thou wast: and that thou think'st I deal With th'envious agents of the evil powerâ But wilt thou recompense me if I serve thee? Beneild. Tell me but how, and if within the scope And compass of my arm and clan to do't, It shall be done. Elpa. See'st thou the pillar'd isle, Whose grey cliffs, like the wreck of some great town, Gulf'd by an earthquake, overtop the waves? There in that isle a mystic creature dens; That bears the semblance of the female form. But, like myself, is monstrous, yet most fair. That hateful thing oft in the sunny calm Elbows aside the restless ocean's swell, And visits this lone coast. But three days since, With smiling eyes and rising breast, she came, Oaring the waters with her nimble arms; And seeing me, as on that shelly seat I ruminated of my wretched lot, She this way hied; and when I crawl'd from view, She follow'd fast with feminine desire To see what I might be, and jeer'd my shapeâ Wilt thou destroy her if I do thee service? Beneild. Why think'st thou that I wouldâ Elpa. Look to you bark: Have they done harm to me that sail therein, That thou dost ask me for a wind to sink her? But thou art form'd to traffic in ill deeds, And I will aid thee for thy spiteful wishes. Come, thou wilt shoot the mermaidâSay thou wilt, And with what bidding I may urge the sea, Thou shalt have thy rewardâComeâ Beneild. Whither, whereâ Elpa. To where thy boat lies ready on the shore; And when the mermaid by thy matchlock dies, Then shalt thou see what I will do, will do. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Shore of Staffa. Glenelg. Forbear, forbear! allow me all my grief. O she is lost! my Agandel is gone, Sunk to the dungeon caverns of the sea! Roll on, ye waves; ye winds, still wilder howl! O never will your random tyranny Enrich the treasures of the miser deep With such a pearl as ye have snatch'd from me. Lo! the just Heavens dart their avenging fires Against the fell and furious ocean's breast. Alas! what sound of power shall wake the sleep Of those that wreck'd in the sea-tangle lie! Ronaldsey. Restrain, Glenelg, this feminine lament, Nor thus, with rash abandonment to woe, Surpass the raving of a woman's grief. Come, let us quit this bleak tempestuous shore, And seek the shelter of some cliff or cave Till the day dawn, or the abating rain Permit the kindling of a signal-fire, To summon succour from the neighb'ring isles. Glenelg. O I could chide for ever at the waves, For they have quench'd to me the charm of life, Light of my soul, and sunbeam of my joyâ But in this gloom of nature and despair, Why stand I venting to th'insensate deep Effectless sorrow, which I thus may end?â [Enter Caluthan.] Ha! what art thou that dare so boldly step Betwixt a wretch's suffering and relief? Ronaldsey. He has some gentleness in his wild look, And seems by his compassionate survey To know our shipwreck and forlorn escape. Glenelg. If thou canst speak, hoary, unearthly form, Say what thou art, and what thou wouldst with us? Caluthan. I am a mortal, like yourselves. Glenelg. It speaks! Our language too! Caluthan. Thrice nine times through the signs The glorious sun his golden car hath driven, Since the dread uproar of the winds and waves Wreck'd my frail vessel on the rugged cliffs That rudely fence this lone enchanted isle. Glenelg. How strange and hollowly his accents sound! Caluthan. But saving once, in such a dismal night, No human form hath since rejoic'd my eyes. Ronaldsey. Art thou then here the sole inhabitant? Caluthan. I am: yet I am not. Glenelg. Who else beside? Caluthan. The child of one, who, like you and myself, Was by the rash remorseless tempest cast To pine and perish here. Ronaldsey. His child, sayst thou? And yet that thou art sole inhabitant? How may this be? Glenelg. Prythee explain thyself. Caluthan. He was a man in fancy most forlorn! The evening's shadow and the midnight's shade, Did more accord with his unsocial mind, Than the bright morning or the cheerful day. Frequent along the lonely murmuring beach He chose his pensive solitary walk. A Mermaid met him, and with syren songs Woo'd him to love, and that fair child was hers. Soon after, he fell into craze, and died, And the sad Mermaid many a summer day Sat moaning on the rocks expecting him. At length the ripen'd mother's time was come, And in a cave, between the ebb and flow, Her beauteous progeny I chanc'd to find, Bedded on sea-weed, sleeping on the sand. I took the child, and bore it to my grot, And constant, at the flowing of the tide, Towards the rocks where the sad mother pined I carried it, and she would smile, and come To give maternal nourishment. Sometimes, Pleas'd she would dandle it amidst the waves, But ever at the ebbing of the sea She brought it back, and laid it softly down. Glenelg. And still this strange and lovely offspring lives? Caluthan. She does. But long ago the mother died. Her grave I dug within the high-sea mark, And fair Marina, as I nam'd the child, Has deck'd the much-lov'd spot with shells and pebbles, Which, when the waves disperse, she still restores. Ronaldsey. What is the semblance of this sea-born nymph? Caluthan. You'd think her moulded to the fullest grace That e'er voluptuous love for dalliance feign'd:â Such is the marbly lustre of her skin, And the enamell'd ruby of her cheek,â Yet all so chaste and passionless her eye, That admiration doats without desire, As on some rare and beauteous piece of art. She is a creature fram'd in gentleness; The sea-cool'd current from her mother's veins Has so allay'd the human of her blood, That though she live to love incapable, Her heart with maiden kindness is possess'd. Her gay green silky hair she often braids With curling tangle, gather'd from the rocks, And finds a sweeter perfume in the weeds That float umbrageous on the crystal wave, Than all the fragrance of the mountain's breast, And flowery pastures of the golden bee. Glenelg. Has she intelligence of speech or sign To hold communion with her father's race? Caluthan. I taught her language; but her mind conceives Things all awry from our accustom'd modes, And finds delight where we should meet annoy. She sometimes sings a sweet pathetic note, And the rude ditty of her own conceit Is wilder than the accents of her strain:â But come with me into my lonely cave, And you shall see the gentle nymph herself; Where, if the wind sigh aught that's musical, She'll raise her voice like one constrain'd by charms, And tune her lay to the symphonious gale. Come with me, strangers, this way lies the path. [Exeunt SCENE II. Beneild CastleâA chamber, lights, &amp;c.âA storm heard without. Lady Beneild and Attendants. Lady B. The priest, the priest! I will make my confession. The white-main'd waves are hungry for their prey, And shake the islands as they leap to catchâ The priestâthe holy priest, that I may tell What mortal instigation hath enjoin'd This Chaos of the ocean and the airâ Hark how the stamp of angry heaven doth shake The vaulted firmament! (thunder.) [Enter Friar.] Come, father, come: My thoughts partake the wildness of the hour, And I am lost if thou canst not appease. Friar. The storm subsides; and far beyond the hills, The parting thunders roll their dreadful cars Into the dark abysms of the air Wherein the tempests sleep. Lady B. But I would tell Who brought them forth, and, with shrill-sounded call, Rous'd the sail-tearing demons of the wind To whelm a fated bark. My son, my son, I saw him in his pinnace sternly seated, Steer from the cliffs where dens the fatal Elpa: And then the mantling blackness first began To wrap the heavens, and o'er the sun's brightface The hideous cowl of darkness was drawn down. This day Glenelg espous'd fair Agandel; And for the scorn of that disdainful maid I fear my son has feed grim Elpa's power To mar their hopeful love. Friar. Unhappy youthâ But the weak malice of incarnate things Cannot infect the universal air, Though envious tongues are potent to do harmâ If more the witch attempts, she mocks your son, And, but with shame, he will repent his faith In her malign pretensionsâLady, come; 'Tis near the wonted time of midnight prayer: Let us into your oriel, and implore Some blessed interdict upon Beneild, In the unhallow'd course of his revenge. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Cave.âa fire in the middle. Marina and Agandel. Agandel. Ah me! how cold, how very cold thy hand! Come to the fire and chafe thyself, sweet maid! Marina. No; let me sit here where the humid air Blows fresh and genial from the foamy sea; The nimble glancing of these spray-like flames Afflicts my dim eyes with a prickling ache, And when I prove the thirsty sense of heat, A drowsy petulance benumbs my wits And lays me languishing with strange disease. Agandel. Thou art, indeed, a strange and wayward thing, To take such pleasure in the stormy shower, And in a night so dark and dire as this To dare the furious tossings of the sea! Marina. And hast not thou enjoyment in the waves?â How was it, then, that in the furious surf I found thee floating with the weltering weeds? Agandel. Alas! thou wak'st in me the sense of woe!â I was this morning wedded to Glenelg; And as we, from Iona's holy isle, Steer'd to his castle, the perfidious winds With sudden fury from our destin'd course, By roaring Corry-vraken drove us here. Marina. I thought that thou wast of the sea-born race: Caluthan, in whose cavern we now sit, Told me my mother dwelt deep in the waves; But that, like him, my sire liv'd on the shore: And I did think when I beheld thy face, So mild, so pale, so beauteous, and benign, That thou wert of the gentle mermaid's kin. Agandel. Ah me! what art thou, if not human born? Marina. Come, sit thee down, nor look so strange at me; Thou art not now so beauteous as before, But wan and sickly, like the frighten'd youth That sought to kiss me, but uncouthly fled, When on my breast he laid his eager hand. 'Twas when the sea was sleeping and serene, As I lay basking on the sandy shore, This garb thrown by, which ever I assume When old Caluthan bids me shelter here, Came rough sea creatures from their floating shell, And leapt on land, where presently they doff'd Their strange attire and dash'd into the sea: I, who such mischievous and noisy things Had never seen, drew near to look at them; Their forms were like Caluthan's, but so gay, So rife with frolic, that my heart grew glad To see how they did wanton in the waves. They saw me as I sat upon the beach, And laugh'd and beckon'd for me to approach, And I did smile to them and beckon back: Then came they all, and one of them, the youth, Embraced me round with rude and eager grasp: But in the instant starting fearful from me, He sought the shore and with his brothers fled Back to their parent shell, which spread its arms, And plying swiftly, speeded out to sea.â But hark, how sweetly the shrill-singing wind Joins the hoarse cadence of the numerous waves Loud sounding on the shore, while soft between The nimble rain-drops tinkle in the pools And patter on the ground.âCome forth with me, And bare thy bosom to the lavish shower. Still, when the rainy-winged western blast Pursues the shadows of the flying clouds Down the steep mountain and across the main, I feel delighted as the watry gems With cooling freshness trickle on my breast; Nay, if thou wilt not come, but shrink and gaze, So pale and timidly, stay by the hearth And pile these faggots, that it may be bright When old Caluthan from his walk returns. [Exit Marina. Agandel. Ah hapless me, what destiny is mine! Oft have I heard that luring mermaids dwell Within the wave-hid caverns of this isle, And surely she is one. And yet, methinks, It is a creature lovely and serene; Born without gall and fram'd to pleasant fancies, Else had it not to this gay grotto brought me, But rather in some dark unfathom'd cave Where only dreadful forms with grasping fangs And wide red throats of yawning horror come, Made me the dainty of some monstrous feast. Protect me, gods! what haggard sprite art thou! O my Glenelg!â [Enter Glenelg, Caluthan, and Ronaldsay.] Glenelg. Are not my eyes enchanted By some gay vapor which the tricking elves That haunt these rocks have painted with her form! It is, it is my Agandel herself. Art thou again created to my hopes! O I have mourn'd thee perish'd in the deep. Be not afraid; this venerable sage Saved me from death and gives me heavenly joy; The joy of meeting in unalter'd beauty With those we love whom we have wept as lostâ The bliss of meeting thee. But tell me, sweet, By what good miracle wast thou preserv'd? For when I found the sudden sweeping blast Had shifted round, and the white-crested waves Drove white and crowding like a flock to fold, Where I had left our fated vessel moor'd, I hastened from my ramble on the hill And saw her from her faithless anchor drive Against the cliffs, and soon beheld the wreck And scattered tackle floating wide and torn. At such a sight how could my heart but fail; How could I but deplore thee perished there. Agandel. And I had perish'd, but my shrieks and cries Brought a fair creature that stood on the strand, And she rescu'd me as I floating toss'd Upon the weltering wreck and foaming brine. Caluthan. It was MarinaâI have taught the nymph What precious freight of parents and of sons The stately ship and skimming pinnace bear, And what sad woe and chill penurious hearths The winter's storm makes in the sailor's home. Hark! what was that? Glenelg. A match-lock fired at hand. [Enter Marina.] Marina. Look, I am hurtâsee how the blood flows here! Agandel. What cruel hand hath done this murderous deed? Marina. As I was sitting on the shore, surveying The morning's eye-beam glancing o'er the waves, Another stranger with unhappy looks Came softly to me, and with flash of fire, Like the cloud-mantled thunder, pierc'd my heart. [Enter Beneild.] Ah, here he comesâWhy didst thou me this harm? Beneild. O Agandel, what have I done for thee? Glenelg. And did'st thou mean the fatal ball for her? Beneild. No, no, Glenelg. Agandel. Alas! the mermaid faints! Marina. My eyes fall drowsy, and I needs must rest: But I grow cold, and would, if I were able, Resist this numbing sleep. (dies.) Agandel. O she is dead! Thought'st thou, Beneild, that I could love the man Who in his bosom had the heart to slay This gentle creature! Beneild. 'Twas the Witch seduced me, Agandel. Then is this sin but sequel to ill thoughts; Or wherefore dealt'st thou in deceitful spells? O, he that seeks to wield unholy power, Is curs'd by Nature to perform ill deeds. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE ON The Mermaid. BY A FRIEND OF THE EDITOR. The little drama which we have here presented to our readers, is one of those happy novelties, to which only the playfulness of genius, intentionally sporting with its own powers, and with the legitimate laws of composition, would give birth; and we will venture to say, that but for the inducement of a work like ours, it probably would never have been written. The piece is evidently not adapted to the stage; and as a dramatic composition, it is of too small an extent, and perhaps too much in the nature of a sketch, to attract attention as a separate publication. Here it is in its proper place; unencumbered with any pretensions calculated to detract from its effect as a work of fancy. The character of Marina is wholly original; and we really do not know in what department of modern literature we could point out to our readers a fiction so skilfully and delicately contrived as this âgay creature of the element.â Perhaps it is not going too far to say, that out of Shakespeare's Tempest a more delightful creation of poetical fancy is scarcely to be found. The witch Elpa is drawn in a more grotesque taste, yet with much strength and originality; and a very powerful talent for description is evinced in the account given of her by Lady Beneild to her son. The Editor takes the liberty of subjoining, that characters purely imaginary seem to be peculiar to the British drama. In the Spanish, saints and devils are sometimes introduced, to heighten the spectacle of the scene, and to unravel knotty points of the plot: but saints and devils have been so long familiar to the world, that the introduction of them into the business of the stage does not require any great exertion of the inventive faculty of the poet. There is another observation which such a production as The Mermaid may possibly suggest to the reader. Of the different varieties of the modern drama, perhaps, indeed, of all dramatic writing, either ancient or modern, the British exhibits the greatest stock of rich and curious fancy; which, perhaps, more than any other cause, tends to render our plays tedious to the people of the Continent. There is less activity in the continental mind than in the insular. The French display, it is true, infinitely more animal vivacity than the English; but we suspect that the English are more rapid in their mental operations, and that although the former make more gesticulations in any given time, the latter, in the same time, think more thoughts; at least it will be allowed that in the dialogue of the drama the French dilate their sentiments into downright declamation, while the English are content merely to touch the keys of association in the minds of their auditors. To do this with effect requires much delicacy in selecting the governing image, if the expression may be used; and the search for this has probably produced that curiously inlaid metaphorical language which is peculiar to the English dramatists, and in which Shakspeare so eminently excels.</field>
