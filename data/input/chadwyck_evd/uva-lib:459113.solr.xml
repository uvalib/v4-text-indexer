      <field name="fulltext">To the Worshipfull, and his honoured Kinsman, Robert Ducie, of Aston, in the County of Stafford Esquire: Son to Sir Robert Ducie, Knight and Baronet Deceased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his loving friend the Author, upon his Tragedy The Rebellion. To praise thee friend, and shew the reason why, Issues from honest love; not flattery. My will is not to flatter, nor for spight To praise, or dispraise; but to doe thee right. Proud daring Rebells, in their impious way Of Machivillian darkenesse; this thy Play Exactly shewes; speakes thee Truths Satyrist, Rebellions Foe, Times honest Artist. Thy continu'd Scenes, Parts, Plots, and Language can Distinguish (worthily) the vertuous Man From the vicious villaine, Earths fatall ill, Intending mischeivous Traitor Machivill. Him and his trech'rous Complices, that strove (Like the Gigantick Rebells warre' gainst Jove) To disenthrone Spains King, (the heavens annoynted) By sterne death all were justly disappoynted, Plots meet with Counter-plots, revenge, and blood, Rebells ruine, makes thy Tragedy good. Nath. Richards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy Esteemed Mr. Thomas Rawlins on his Rebellion. I may not wonder, for the world does know, What Poets can, and oft times reach unto. They oft worke myracles: No marvaile than Thou mak'st thy Tailer here a Nobleman: Would all the Trade were honest too but he Hath learn't the utmost of the Mystery, Filching with cunning industery, the heart Of such a beauty, which did prove the smart Of many worthy Lovers, and doth gaine That prize which others labour'd for in vaine. Thou mak'st him valiant too, and such a spirit, As every Noble mind approves his merit. But what Renowne th'ast given his worth, tis fit The world should render to thy hopefull wit, And with a welcome Plaudit entertaine This lovely issue of thy teeming braine. That their kinde usage to this birth of thine, May winne so much upon thee for each line Thou hast bequeath'd the World thou'lt give her tenne And raise more high the glory of thy Penne, Accomplish these our wishes, and then see, How all that love the Arts will honour thee. C. G.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my friend Mr. Rawlins, upon this Play, his Worke. Friend, in the faire compleatnesse of your play. Y'ave courted Truth; in these few lines to say Something concerning it, that all may know J pay no more of praise than what I owe. 'Tis good, and merit much more faire appeares Apparelled in plaine prayse, then when it weares A complementall glosse. Taylers may boast Th'ave gain'd by your young Pen what they long lost By the old Proverbe, which sayes, Three to a man: But to your vindicating Muse, that can Make one a man, and a man Noble, they Must wreaths of Bayes as their due praises pay. Robert Davenport.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author on his Rebellion. Thy Play I ne're saw: what shall I say then? I in my vote, must doe as other men, And praise those things to all, which common Fame Does boast of, such a hopefull growing flame, Which in dispight of flattery shall shine, Till Envy at thy Glory doe repine: And on Pernassus cliffie top shall stand, Directing wandring wits to wish'd for Land; Like a Beacon o'th' Muses Hill remaine, That still doth burne, not lesser light retaine. To shew that other wits, compar'd with thee, Is but Rebellion i'th' high'st degree. For from thy Labours (thus much I doe scan) A Tayler is ennobled to a man. R. W.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deare friend, Mr. Thomas Rawlins. To see a Springot of thy tender age, With such a lofty straine to word a Stage; To see a Tragedy from thee in print, With such a world of fine Meanders in't, Pusles my wondring soule: for there appeares Such disproportion twixt thy Lines and Yeares. That when I read thy Lines, methinkes J see The sweet tongu'd Ovid fall upon his knee, With (Parce precor) every line, and word, Runnes in sweet numbers of its owne accord: But I am wonder-strook, that all this while Thy unfeather'd qui'll should write a Tragicke stile. This above all my admiration drawes, That one so young should know Dramatticke Lawes. 'Tis rare, and therefore is not for the span, Or greasie thumbes of every common man. The Damaske Rose that sprouts before the Spring Js fit for none to smell at, but a King. Goe on sweet friend, I hope in time to see Thy Temples rounded with the Daphnean Tree. And if men aske who nurst thee, Ile say thus, Jt was the Ambrosian Spring of Pegasus. Rob. Chamberlain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Friend Mr. Thomas Rawlins, on his Play called the Rebellion. I will not praise thee Friend, nor is it fit, Least I be said to flatter what y'have writ. For some will say, I writ to applaud thee, That when I print thou maist doe so for me. Faith they're deceiv'd, thou justly claim'st thy Bayes. Vertue rewards her selfe; thy work's thy praise. T. Iourdan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author, Master Thomas Rawlins. Kind friend excuse me that doe thus intrude, Thronging thy Volume with my lines so rude. Applause is needlesse here, yet this I owe As due to th'Muses: thine ne're su'd (I know) For hands, nor voyce, nor pen, nor other praise Whatsoe're by mortalls us'd, thereby to raise An Authors name eternally to blisse; Wer't rightly scann'd (alas) what folly 'tis: As if a Poets single worke alone, Wants power to lift him to the spangled Throne Of highest Iove: or needes their luke-warme fires, To cut his way or pierce the circled Spheares. Foolish presumption! whosoe're thou art, Thus fondly deem'st of Poets princely Art. Here needs no paultry petty Pioners skill To fortifie; nay thy melefluous quill Strikes Momus with a maze, and silence deepe, And doom'd poore Zoilus to the Lethean sleepe. Then ben't dismay'd, J know thy Booke will live, And deathlesse Trophies to thy name shall give. Who doubts, where Venus and Minerva meete In every line, how pleasantly they greete? Strewing thy paths with Roses, red and white, To decke thy Silver-streames of fluent wit; And entertaine the graces of thy minde O may thy early head be sweet shelter finde, Under the umbraes of those verdant bayes: Ordain'd for sacred Posies sweet layes. Such are thy lines, in such a curious dresse, Compos'd so quaintly; that if J may guesse, None save thine owne should dare t'approach the Presse. J. Gough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the ingenious Author. A sowre and austere kind of men there be, That would out-law the lawes of Poesie; And from a Common-wealths well govern'd Lists, Some grave and too much severe Platonists, Would exclude Poets: and have emnity With the soules freedome, ingenuity. These are so much for wisedome, they forget That Heaven allow'th the use of modest wit. These thinke the Author of a jest alone, Is the man that deserves damnation: Holding mirth vitious, and to laugh a sin: Yet we must give these Cynicks leave to grin. What will they thinke, when they shall see thee in The plaines of faire Elizium? sit among A crowned troope of Poets? and a throng Of ancient Bardes, which soule-delighting Quire; Sings daily Anthemnes to Apolloes Lyre. Amongst which thou shalt sit; and crowned thus, Shalt laugh at Cato and Democritus. Thus shall thy Bayes be superscrib'd; my Pen Did not alone make Playes, but also men. E. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend of the Author. Blesse me you sacred Sister. What a throng Of choice Encomions's prest? such as was sung When the sweet singer Stesichorus liv'd; Upon whose lips the Nightingale surviv'd. What makes my sickly fancy hither hye (Unlesse it be for shelter?) when the eye Of each peculiar Artist makes a quest After my slender Iudgement: then a Jest Dissolves my thoughts to nothing, and my paines Has its reward in adding to my staines. But as the Riuer of Athamas can fire The sullen wood, and make its flames aspire, So the infused comfort I receive By th'tye of friendship, prompts me to relieve My fainting spirits; and with a full saile, Rush 'mongst your Argoseys dispite of haile, Or stormes of Critticks. Friend, to thee J come, I know th'ast harbour, I defie much roome: Besides, Ile pay thee for't in gratefull Verse, Since that thou art Witts abstract, Ile rehearse: Nothing shall wooll your eares with a long Phraise, Of a sententious folly; for to raise Sad Pyramids of flattery, that may be Condemn'd for the sincere prolixity. Let Envy turne her Mantle, and expose Her rotten intralls to infect the Rose, Or pine like greennesse of thy extant wit: Yet shall thy Homers Shield demolish it. Upon thy Quill as on an Eagles wing, Thou shalt be led through th'ayre's sweet whispering: And with thy Pen thou shalt ingrave thy name, (Better then Pencill) in the List of fame. I. Tatham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Master Rawlins and his Tayler in the Rebellion. In what a strange delemma stood my mind, When first I saw the Tayler? and did finde It so well fraught with wit: but when I knew The Noble Tayler to proceed from you; I stood amaz'd, as one with thunder strook. And knew not which to read; you, or your Booke. I wonder how you could, being of our race, So Eagle-like looke PhÅbus in the face. I wonder how you could, being so yong And teeming yet, encounter with so strong And firme a Story, 'twould indeed have prov'd A subject for the wisest, that had lov'd To sucke at Aganippe. But goe on, My best of friends, and as you have begun With that is good, so let your after times Transcendent be. Apollo he still shines On the best wits; and if a Momus chance On this thy Volume scornfully to glance, Melpomene will defend, and you shall see, That Vertue will at length make Envy flee. I. Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Ingenious Friend Mr. Rawlins, the Author of the Rebellion. What need I strive to prayse thy worthy frame, Or raise a Trophy to thy lasting name? Were my bad wit with Eloquence refin'd, When I have said my most, the most's behind. But that I might be knowne for one of them, Which doe admire thy wit, and love thy pen. J could not better shew forth my good will, Then to salute you with my Virgin Quill. And bring you something to adorne your head Among a throng of friends, who oft have read Your learned Poems, and doe honour thee: And thy bright Genius. How like a curious tree Is thy sweet fancy, bearing fruit so rare The Learned still will covet. Momus no share Shall have of it; but end his wretched dayes In griefe, 'cause now now he seeth th'art Crown'd with Bayes. Jo. Meriell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Act First.] [Scene I.] Enter severally, Alerzo, Fulgentio, and Pandolpho. Alerzo. Collonell Ful. Signior Alerzo. Aler. Heere. Pan. Signiors well met: The lazy morne has scarcely trim'd her selfe To entertaine the Sun; she still retaines The slimy tincture of the banisht night: I hardly could discerne you. Aler. But you appeare fresh as a City Bridegroome, That has sign'd his wife a warrant for the Grafting hornes; how fares Belinda, After the weight of so much sin? you lay with her To night; come, speake, did you take up on trust, Or have you pawn'd a Collony of Oathes? Or an imbroydered Belt? or have you tane The Courtiers tricke, to lay your sword at morgage? Or perhaps a Feather? 'twill serve in trafficke, To returne her Ladiship, a Fanne, or so. Pan. Y'are merry. Ful. Come be free, Leave modesty for women to gild Their pretty thriving Art of plentitude, To inrich their Husbands browes with cornucopiaes: A Souldier and thus bashfull! Poxe be open. Pan. Had I the Poxe good Colonell, I should stride Farre opener then I doe: But pox o'the fashion. Aler. Count Antonio. To them enter Antonio. Ful. Tho he appeare fresh as a bloome That newly kist the Sun, adorn'd with pearly Drops, flung from the hand of the rose finger'd morne, Yet in his heart lives a whole Host of valour. Pan. Hee appeares A second Mars. Aler. More powerfull since he holds Wisedome And Vallour captive. Ful. Let us salute him. Whilst they salute Antonio enters Count Machvile. Mach. Ha! how close they strike, As if they heard a winged thunder-bolt, threatn'd his death And each ambitious were to lose his life; So it might purchase him a longer being: Their breath ingenders like two peacefull winds, That joyne a friendly league, and fill the ayre With silken musicke. I may passe by and scarce be spar'd a looke, Or any else but yong Antonio. Rise from thy scorching Den thou soule of mischiefe. My blood boyles hotter then the poyson'd flesh Of Hercules cloth'd in the Centaurs shirts: Swell me revenge, till I become a hill High as Olimpus cloud dividing top; That I might fall, and crush them into ayre. Ile observe. Exit behind the hangings. Ant.

Good sir no more, This ungratefull Land owes you too much already. Aler. And you still bind it in stronger Bonds. Pan. Your noble deeds, that like to thoughts out-strip The fleeting clouds, dash all our hopes of payment: We are poore but in unprofitable thankes; Nay that cannot rehearse enough your merit. Ant. I dare not heare this; pardon bashfull eares For suffering such a scarlet to o're-spread Your burning Portalls. Gentlemen your discourses tast of Court, They have a relish of knowne flattery; I must deny to understand their folly: Your pardon, I must leave you, Modesty commands. Ful. Your honours vassales. Ant. O good Colonell be more a Souldier, Leave complements for those that live at ease, To stuffe their Table Bookes; and o're a bord, Made gaudy with some Pageant, beside custards, Whose quaking strikes a feare into the eaters. Dispute 'em in a fashionable method. A Souldiers language should be as his calling, (Ruffe) to declare he is a man of fire. Farewell without the straining of a sinew, No superstitious cringe; adue. Exit. Aler. I'st not a hopefull Lord? Nature to him has chain'd the peoples hearts; Each to his Saint offers a forme of prayer For yong Antonio. Pan. And in that loved name pray for the Kingdoms good. Ful. Count Matchvill. Aler. Let's away. Machvile from behind the hangings. Exeunt: manet Matchvill. Heart wilt not burst with rage, to see these slaves Fawne like to whelpes on yong Antonio, And fly from me as from infection? Death, Confusion, and the list of all deseases, waite upon your lives Till you be ripe for Hell; which when it gapes May it devoure you all: stay Machvile, Leave this same idle chat, it becomes woman That has no strength; but what her tongue Makes a Monopoly, be more a man, Thinke, thinke; in thy braines minte Coyne all thy thoughts to mischiefe: That may act revenge at full. Plot, plot, tumultious thoughts, incorporate; Beget a lumpe how e're deform'd, that may at length Like to a Cub lick'd by the carefull Dam, Become like to my wishes perfect vengeance. Antonio, I Antonio; nay all Rather then loose my will, shall head-long fall Into eternall ruine; my thoughts are high, Death sit upon my brow; let every frowne, Banish a soule that stops me of a crowne. Exit. Enter Evadne and Nurse. Evad. The Taylor yet return'd Nurse? Nur. Madam not yet. Evad. I wonder why he makes gownes so imperfect They need so many sayes. Nur. Truely, insooth, and in good deed law Madam The stripling is in love deepe, deepe in love. Evad. Ha, Does his soule shoote with an equall Dart From the commanding Bow of loves great God, Keepe passionate time with mine? or has aside. She spy'd my errour to reflect with eager beames Of thirsty love upon a Taylor, being my selfe Borne high?âI must know more. In love good Nurse; with whom? Nur. Hey-hoe, truely madam 'tis a fortune, Cupid good lad, prais'd be his god-head for't Has throwne upon me, and I am proud on't; O 'tis a youth joccond as sprightly May, One that will doe discreetly with a wife, Bord her without direction from the stars, Or counsell from the Moone to doe for Physicke; No, he's a backe;âO 'tis a backe indeed. Evad. Fye this becomes you not. Nur. Besides, he is of all that conquering Calling, A Taylor madam; O 'tis a taking Trade: What Chamber-maid, with reverence may I speake, of those lost Maiden-heads, Could long hold out against a Taylor? Evad. Y'are uncivill. Nur. What aged Female, for I must confesse I am Worne threed-bare, would not be turn'd and live a marriage life To purchase Heaven? Enad. Heavenâ Nur. Yes my deare Madam Heaven, whither My most sweet Lady but to Heaven? hell's a Taylors ware-house; he has the Keyes, and sits In triumph crosse legg'd o're the mouth: It is no place of horrour. There's no flames made blew with Brimstone; But the bravest silkes, so fashionable: O I doe long to weare such properties. Evad. Leave your talke, One knocks, goe see. Knockes within. Nurs. O 'tis my love. I come. Exit. Evad. A Taylor, fye, blush my too tardy soule, And on my brow place a becomming scorne, Whose fatall sight may kill his mounting hopes. Were he but one that when 'twas said hee's borne, Had bin borne noble, high, Equall in blood to that our House boasts great; I'de fly into his armes with as much speed, As an ayre cutting arrow to the stake. But O he comes, my fortitude is fled. Enter Nurse and Giovanno with a Gowne. Gio. Yonder she is and walkes, yet in sence strong enough to maintaine Argument, she's under my cloake; for the best part of a Lady as this age goes is her Clothes; in what reckoning ought we Taylers to be esteem'd then, that are the master workemen to correct nature? You shall have a Lady in a Diologue with some gallant, touching his Suite, the better part of man, so sucke the breath that names the skilfull Tayler as if it nourisht her. Another Dona fly from the close imbracements of her Lord, to be all over measur'd by her Tayler. One will bee sicke forsooth, and bid her maid deny her to this Don, that Earle, the other Marquesse, nay to a Duke; yet let her Taylor lase and unlase her gowne, so round the skirts to fit her to the fashion: here's one has in my sight made many a noble Don to hang the head, Dukes and Marquesses, three in a morning breake their fasts on her denialls; yet I, her Tayler, blest bee the kindnesse of my loving stare, am usher'd; she smiles and sayes I have staid too long, and then findes fault with some slight stitch, that eye let hole's too close, then must I use my Bodkin 'twill never please else; all will not doe, I must take it home, for no cause but to bring it her againe next morning. Wee Taylors are the men spight o'the Proverbe, Ladies cannot live without. It is wee That please them best, in their commodity: There's magick in our habits, Taylors can Prevaile 'bove him, honour stiles best of man. Evad. Bid him draw neere. Nur. Come hither love, sweet chucke My Ladye calls. Gio. What meanes this woman? sure she loves me too, Taylors shall speed had they no tongues to wooe: Women wou'd sue to them. Evad. What have you done it now? Gio. Maddam your gowne by my industry Is purg'd of errours. Evad. Lord what a neate methodicall way you have To vent your Phrases; pray when did you commence? Gio. What meane you Madam? Evad. Doctor I meane, you speake so physicall. Nur. Nay Madam 'tis a youth, I praise my starrs For their kind influence, a woman may be proud on, And I am. O 'tis a youth in print, a new Adonis, And I could wish, although my glasse tells me I'me wondrous faire, I were a Venus for him. Gio. O Lady, you are more fairer by farre. Nur. La you there Madam. Gio. Where art thou man? art thou transform'd? Or art thou growne so base that This rediculous witch should thinke I love her? Evad. Leave us. Nur. I goe Ducke, Ile be here anon, I will Dove. Exit. Gio. At your best leasure. Protect me man-hood, least my glutted sence Feeding with such an eager appetite on Your rare beauty, breaking the sluces, Burst into a flood of passionate teares; I must, I will enjoy her, though a Destroying clap from Ioves Artillery were the reward: And yet dull-daring sir by your favour no, He must be more than savage can attempt aside. To injure so much spotlesse innocence: Pardon great Powers the thought of such offence. Evad. When Sabastiano clad in conquering steele, And in a phrase able to kill, or from a cowards heart Banish the thought of feare; wo'd me, Won not so much upon my captive soule As this youths silence does: aside. Helpe me some power out of this tangling maze, I shall be lost else. Gio. Feare to the breast of women, Build thy throne on their soft hearts; Mine must not be thy slave. Your pleasure Madam. Evad. I have a question must be directly answer'd No excuse, but from thy heart a truth. Gio. Command me Madam, were it a secret On whose hinges hung the casements of my life, Yet your command shall be obey'd; to the least Scruple. Evad. I take your word, My aged Nurse tells me you love her, Answer; i'st a truth? Gio. She's jealous, Ile try; As Oracle. Evad. (Ha) Gio. 'tis so, ile further; I love her Madam, With as rich a flame as Anchorits Doe Saints they offer prayers too: I hug her memory as I wou'd embrace The breath of Iove, when it pronounc'd me Happy; or Prophet, that should speake my After life great, even with adoration deified. Evad. My life, like to a bubble i'th aire, Dissolv'd by some uncharitable winde, Denyes my body warmth: your breath Has made me nothing. (she faints. Gio. Rather let me lose all externall being. Madam, good Madam. Evad. You say you love her. Gio. Madam, I doe. Can any love the beauty of a stone, Set by some curious Artist in a Ring, But he must attribute some to The File that addes unto the lustre? You appeare like to a Jemme, cut by the Steddy hand of carefull Nature, into such Beautious Tablets, that dull Art, Famous in skilfull flattery, is become A Novice in what Fame proclaim'd him Doctor; He cann't expresse one sparke of your great lustre. Madam, those Beauties that, but studied on By their admirers, are deifi'd, serve But as spots, to make your red and white Envy'd of Cloisterd Saints. Evad. Have I ungratefull man, like to the Sun, That from the Heavens sends downe his Cherishing beames on some religious plant, That with a bow the worship of the Thankfull, payes the preserver of his life, And groth: But thou, unthankfull man, In scorne of me, to love a Callender of many Yeares. Gio. Madam, upon my knees, a superstitious Rite, The Heathens us'd to pay their gods, I offer up. A life, that untill now nere knew a price; Made deare because you love it. Evad. Arise; it is a Ceremony due unto none but heaven. Gio. Here Ile take roote, and grow into my grave, Unlesse deare goddesse you forget to bee Cruell to him adores you with a zeale, Equall to that of Hermits. Evad. I beleeve you, and thus exchange a devout vow, Humbly upon my knees, that though the Thunder of my brothers rage should force divorce, Yet in my soule to love you; witnesse all The wing'd inhabitants of the highest heaven. Gio. If suddaine lightning, such as vengefull Iove Cleares the infectious ayre with, threatn'd to Scorch my daring soule to Cynders, if I Did love you, Lady, I wo'd love you, spight Of the dogged Fates, or any power Those curst Hagges set to oppose me. To them enter Nurse. Evad. Be thy selfe againe. Nurs. Madam, your Brother. Evad. Fye, you have done it ill, our brother, say you? Pray you take it home and mend it. Gio. Madam, it shall be done; I take my leave. Love I am made thy envy; I am he This Votresse prayes unto, as unto thee: Taylers are more than men; and here's the odds, They make fine Ladyes; Ladyes make them gods: And so they are not men, but farre above them: This makes the Tailers proud; then Ladies love them. Exit. Antonio meets him. Ant. What's he that past? Evad. My Tailer. Ant. Theres something in his face I sure should know. But sister to your Beads; pray for distress'd Scivel; Whilst I mount some watch tower, To o're-looke our enemies, religious lawes Commands me fight for my lov'd: Countries cause. Exit. Evad. Love bids me pray, and on his Altars make A Sacrifice, for my lov'd Taylers sake. Exit. Alarum. Enter Raymond, Philippa, Leonis, Gilberty, and Fyrenzo. Ray. Stand. Leo. Stand. Gil. Stand. Fir. Give the word through the Army, stand there. Within. Stand, stand, stand, stand hoe. Ray. Bid the Drum cease, whilst we embrace our love: Come my Philippa, like the twins of warre, Lac'd in our steely Cornets, we're become The envy of those braine begotten gods, Mouldy Antiquity lifted to Heaven: Thus we exchange our breath; kisses. Phil. My honour'd Lord, Duty commands, I pay it backe againe, 'Twill waste me into smoake else, Can my body retaine that breath, that wou'd Consume an Army, drest in a rougher habit. Pray deliver (come I'me a gentle thiefe) The breath you stole. Ray. Restore back mineâSo, goe pitch our tent, we'le Have a Combate i'th field of love, with thee Philippa, ere we meet the foe: thou art A friendly enemy. How say you Lords, Does not my Love appeare, Like to the issue of the braine of Iove, Governesse of Armes and Arts, Minerva? Or a selected beauty from a troop of Amazons. Lords. She is a Mine of valour. Phil. Lords spare your praises till like Bradament, The mirrour of our Sexe, I make the foe Of France and us, crouch like a whelpe, Aw'd by the heaving of his Masters hand; My heart runnes through my arme, and when I deale A blow, it sinkes a soule: My sword flyes nimbler than the bolts of Iove, And wounds as deepe: Spaine, thy proud host shall feele Death has bequeath'd his office to my steele. Ray. Come on brave Lords, upon your Generalls word, Philippa loves no parley, like the sword. Exeunt. Enter Giovannno, old Taylor, Virmine, and two more. Gio. Come bullies, come; wee must forsake the use of nimble sheeres, and now betake us to our Spanish needles, Stelletto blades, and prove the Proverbe lyes, lyes in his throat: one Tayler can erect sixteene, nay more, of upstart Gentlemen, knowne by their Cloathes, and leave enough materialls in hell to damne a broker. Old. We must to the wars my boyes. Virm. How Master, to the warres? Old. I to the warres Virmine, what sayst thou to that? Virm. Nothing, but that I had rather stay at home: O the good penny bread at breakfasts that I shall lose! Master, good Master let me alone, to live with honest Iohn, noble John Blacke. 2 Tay. Wilt thou disgrace thy worthy calling, Virmine? Virm. No, but I am afraid my calling will disgrace me: I shall be gaping for my mornings loafe, and dramme of Ale; I shall; and now and then look for a Cabbich leafe, or an odde remnant to cloath my bashfull buttocks. Old. You shall. Virm. Yes marry; why I hope poore Vermine must bee fed, and will be fed, or Ile torment you. Gio. Master I take priviledge from your love to hearten on my fellowes. Old, I, I; doe, doe good boy. Exit. Gio. Come my bold fellowes, let us eternize, For our Countries good, some noble act That may by time be Regestred at full; And as the yeare renewes, so shall our fame Be fresh to after times: the Taylers name, So much trod under, and the scorne of all Shall by this act be high whilst others fall. 3 Tay. Come Vermine, come. Virm. Nay if virmine slip from the backe of a Tayler, spit him with a Spanish Needle; or torment him in the louses Engin: your two thumbe nailes. Exit all but Giovanno. Gio. The City seig'd, and thou thus chain'd In ayrie fetters of a Ladies love; It must not be, stay, 'tis Evadne's love; Her life is with the City ruin'd, if the French become victorious: Evadne must not dye, her Chaster name That once made cold, now doth my blood inflame. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act Second. Scene I. A Table and Chaires. Enter (after a shoute crying Antonio,) the Governour and Count Machvile. Gov. Hell take their spacious throates, we shall e're long Be pointed as a prodige; Antonio is the man they loade with praise, And we stand as a Cypher to advance Him by a number higher. Mach. Now Machvile plot his ruine, aside. It is not to be borne; are not you our Masters subsitude? then why should he Usurpe a priviledge without your leave, To preach unto the people a Doctrine They ought not heare: He incites 'em not to obey your charge, Unlesse it be to knit a friendly league With the opposing French; laying before 'em A troope of fained dangers will insue, If we doe bid 'em battle. Gov. Dares he doe this? Mach. 'Tis done already; Smother your anger and you shall see, here At the Counsell boarde he'le breake into a Passion;âwhich ile provoke him to.â aside. To them Antonio, Alerzo, Fulgentio, and Pandolpho: they sit in Counsell. Gov. Never more neede, my worthy partners, in The dangerous brunts of Iron warre, had we Of Counsell: the hot rain'd French, led by that Haughty Moore, (upon whose sword sits Victory inthron'd) daily increase; And like the Army of another Xerxes, Make the o're burthen'd earth groane at their weight. We cannot long hold out; nor have we hope Our Royall Master can raise up their Seige E're we be forc't to yeeld: My Lord your counsell 'tis a desperate griefe. Mach. And must my Lord finde undelaid release? Noble Commanders since that warres grim god, After our sacrifice of many lives, Neglects our offerings, and repayes our service With losse; 'tis good to deale with policy. He's no true Souldier that deales heedlesse blowes With the indangering of his life; and may Walke in a shade of safety, yet o'rethrow His towering enemy. Great Alexander made the then knowne world Slave to his powerfull will, more by the helpe Of polliticke wit, Than by the ruffe compultion of the sword. Troy that indur'd the Grecians ten yeares Siege, By pollicy was fir'd, and became Like to a lofty Beacon all on flame. Gov. Hum, hum. Mach. Suppose the French be markt for conquerers: Starrs have bin crost, when at a naturall birth They dart prodigious beames; their influence Like to the flame of a new-lighted Tapor, Has with the breath of pollicy bin blowne Out, even to nothing. Ful. Hum, hum. Aler. This has bin studied. Pan. He's almost out. Gov. Good, But to the matter; Your counsell. Mach. 'Tis this my Lord; That straight before the French have pitcht their Tents, Or rais'd a worke before our City walls; As yet their ships have not o're spread the sea, We send a Regiment that may with speed Land on the Marshes, and begirt their backes, Whilst we open our Gates, and with a strong assault Force 'em retreat into the armes of death: So the revengefull earth shall be their tombe, That did ere while trample her teeming wombe. Gov. Machvile speakes Oracle; What sayes Antonio? Ant. Nothing. Gov. How? Ant. Nothing. Mach. It takes: revenge, I hugge thee; yong Lord thou' art lost. aside. Gov. Speake Antonio your counsell. Ant. Nothing. Gov. How? Ant. So; And could my wish obtaine a sudden grant From yon Tribunall, I would crave, my sences Might be all steept in Lethe, to forget What Machvile has spoken. Mach. Ha, it takes unto my wish. aside. Why Antonio? Ant. Because you speake Not like a man, that were possest with a Meere Souldiers heart; much lesse a soule guarded With subtle sinewes: O madnesse, can there be In nature such a prodegie so sencelesse, So much to be wondred at, As can applaud or lend a willing eare To that my blushes doe betray I've bin Tardy to heare? your childish pollicy. Gov. Antonio you're too bold; this usurpt liberty To abuse a man of so much merit, is not Seemely in you: nay Ile terme it sawcinesse. Ant. Nay then my Lord, I claime the priviledge Of a Counseller, and will object. This my Propheticke feares, whisper'd my heart: When from a watch Tower I beheld the French Erect their speares; which like a mighty Grove Denied my eyes any other object: The tops showd by a stolen reflection from The Sun like Diamonds, or as the glorious Guilder of the day, should daine a lower visit Then my warme blood; that us'd to play like Summer, felt a change; Gray-bearded winter Froze my very soule, till I became Like the Pyrenian Hills, rapt in a roabe of Ice: My Atticke feares froze me into a statue. Aler. Cowardly Antonio. Ful. I have lost my faith, And can behold him now without a wonder. Gov. Antonio, y'are too long and wracke our patience; Your counsell? Ant. I fear'd, but what? not our proud enimies No, did they burthen all our Spanish world: And I, poore I; onely surviv'd to threat defiance In the Mounsiers teeth, and stand Defendant For my Countries cause; naked, unarm'd. I'de through their bragging Host, and pay my life A Sacrifice to death, for my lov'd Countries safety Aler. Fulgentio thou hast not lost Thy faith? Ful. Noe, i'me reformed he's valiant. Go. Antonio your counsell. Ma. I your counsell. An. Our foes increase to an unreckon'd number: We lesse then nothing, since we have no hope To arrive a number, that may cope with Halfe their Army. 'Tis my counsell we strike a league: 'Tis wisedome to sue peace, where powerfull Fate Threatens a ruine: least repent too late. Ful. 'Tis god-like Counsell. Aler. And becomes the tongue of yong Antonio. Gov. Antonio let me tell you, you have lost Your valiant heart; I can with safety now Terme you a Coward. Ant. Ha. Gov. Nay more, Since by your Oratory, you strive To rob your Country of a glorious conquest; That may to after times beget a feare, Even with the thought should awe the trembling World: you are a Traytor. An. Ha my Lord, Coward and Traytor, tis a damned lye, And in the heart of him dares say't againe Ile write his errour. M. 'Tis as I wou'd hav't. Fu. Noble Antonio. Aler. Brave spirited Lord. Fu. The mirrour of a Souldier. Go. O are you mov'd first has the deserved name Of Traytor prickt you? An. Deserv'd? Go. Yes. M. Yes. An. Machvile thou lyest; hadst thou a heart Of harden'd steele, my powerfull Arme Should pierce it. They fight all in a confused manner: Antonio kills the Governour. Machvile falls. Aler. The Governour Slaine by Antonio's hand? Fu. No, by the hand of Iustice; fly, fly my Lord. Aler. Send for a Chirurgeon to dresse Count Machvile, He must be now our Governour; the King Signed it in the dead Governours Commission. Exeunt sol. An. Now I repent too late my rash contempt, The horrour of a Murtherer will still Follow my guilty thoughts, fly where I will. Exit Antonio. Mach. I'me wounded, else Coward Antonio Thou shouldst not fly from my revengefull Arme: But may my curses fall upon thy head Heavy as thunder; maist thou dye Burthen'd with ulcerous sins, whose very Weight may sinke thee downe to Hell: Beneath the reach of smooth-fac'd mercies arme. A shoute within crying Antonio. Confusion choake your rash officious throates, And may that breath that speakes his loathed name Beget a Plague, whose hot infectious aire May scald you up to blisters, which foretell A purge of life: up Machvile, Tho'st thy will, how ere crosse Fate Divert the peoples hearts; they must perforce Sue to that Shrine our liking shall erect. The Governour is dead, Antonio's lost To any thing but death; 'tis our glad fate, To gripe the staffe of what wee look't for state. My bloods ambitious, and runs through my veines Like nimble water through a Leaden Pipe Up to some barren Mountaine: I must have more, All wealth in my thoughts to a Crowne is poore. Enter Giovanno, Evadne and Nurse. Gio. 'Tis a neate Gowne and fashionable Madam; i'st not love? Nur. Upon my Virginity wonderfull handsome: Deare, when we are married Ile have such a one; Shall I not chicken? ha. Gi. What else, kind Nurse. Nur. Truely you Taylers are the most sanctified members Of a Kingdome: How many crooked and untoward bodies have You set upright, that they goe now so straight in their Lives and conversation, as the proudest on them all? Gi. That's certaine, none prouder. Evad. How meane you sir? Gi. Faith Madam your crooked moveables in artificiall bodies, that rectifie the deformity of natures over-plus, as bunching backes, or scarcity, as scanty shoulders, are the proudest creatures; you shall have them jet it with an undaunted boldnesse; for the truth is, what they want in substance they have in ayre: They will scould the Tayler out of his Art, And impute the defect of nature to his want Of skill, though his labour make her appearance Pride worthy. Nur. Well said my birds eye, stand for the credit of: Taylers whilst thou livest; wilt thou not Chucke? Ha, sayst thou my deare? Gi. I were ungratefull else. Evad. Nurse pray leave us, your presence makes your Sweet heart negligent of what he comes about; Pray be won to leave us here. Nur. Madam your will's obey'd: Yet I can hardly passe from thee my love. At such a suddaine warning. Gi. Your eager love may be termed dotage, For shame confesse your selfe to lesse expressions: Leave my Lady. Nur. A kisse and then I goe, so; farewell my Duck. Exit. Gi. Death she has left a scent to poison me; Love her said she, is any man so mad, to hugge a disease, Or imbrace a colder Image then Pigmalions Or play with the bird of Frosty antiquity, not I: Her gumms stinke worse then a Pest-house, And more danger of infecting. As I'me a mortall Tayler; and your servant Madam, Her breath has tainted me I dare not salute Your Ladiship. Evad. Come you are loath to part with't, 'tis so sweet. Gi. Sweet say you Madam, a muster of diseases Can't smell worse, than her rotten teeth. Excuse my boldnesse, to deferre your longing; Thus I am new created with your breath. Kisses. My gaping pores will ne're be satisfied. Againeâthey still are hungry. Evad. My deare friend, let not thy lovely person March with the scoulding peace affrighting Drum: War is too cruell: come ile chaine You here, here in my armes; and stiffle you With kisses; you sha'not goeâby this you sha'not goe. Gi. By this I must. Evad. Ile smother that harsh breath. They kisse. Gi. Againe I counter-checke it. Enter Antoino as pursued, sees them and stands amazed. Ant. O sister, ha! What killing sight is this! cannot be she. Sister. Evad. O my deare friend, my brother, w'are undon. Ant. Degenerate girle, lighter than wind or ayre; Canst thou forget thy birth? or 'cause thou'rt faire Art priviledg'd, dost thinke with such a zeale To graspe an under shrub? dare you exchange Breath with your Taylers, without feare of vengeance From the desturbed ghosts of our dead Parents, For their bloods injury? or are your favours Growne prostitute to all? my unkind Fate Grieves me not halfe so much, as thee forgetfull. Gi, Sir if on me this language, I must tell you, You are too rash to censure. My unworthinesse that makes Her seeme so ugly in your eyes, perhaps Hangs in these cloaths; and's shifted off with them. I am as noble, but that I hate to make Comparisons, as any you can thinke worthy To be call'd her husband. An. Shred of a slave thou lyest. Gi. Sir I am hasty too; yet in the presence of my Mistris can use a temper. An. Brave; your mistris. Enter Machvile with Officers. Ma. Lay hold on him, Ere we presume to meete the enemy Weele purge the City; lest the wrath of heaven Fall heavy on us: Antonio I arrest thee Of Capitall treason, 'gainst the King and Realme. To prison with him. Evad. O my lost brother! Gi. 'Tis but an errour, treason d'ye call it; to kill The Governour in heate of blood, and not intended? For my Evadne's sake, something Ile doe Shall save his life. Exit. Ma. To prison with him. An. Farewell Evadne, as thou lovest the peace Of our dead Ancestors, cease to love So loath'd a thing; a Tayler, Why? 'tis the scorne of all; therefore be rul'd By thy departing Brother, doe not mixe With so much basenesse: Come Officers, beare me e'ne where you please, My opprest conscience no where can have ease. Exit with Officers. Ma. Lady we here enjoyne you to Your Chamber as a prisoner, to Waite a further censure; your brothers Fault has pul'd a punishment upon your head, Which you must suffer. Evad. 'Ene what you please, your tyranny can't beare A shape so bad to make Evadne feare; Strong innocence shall guard my afflicted soule, Whose constancy shall tyranny controule. Exeunt. A noise within crying Rescue, Rescue. Enter Antonio and Guard, to them Giavanno and Taylers and Rescues him; and beate them off. Enter a Officer meeting Machvile. Of. A troope of Taylers by force have tane Antonio from us, and have borne him (spight Of the best resistance we could make) unto some Secret place, we can not finde him. Ma. Screech-owle dost know what thou hast said? Death, finde him or you dye: O my crosse starres, He must not live to torture our vext sence, But dye; though he had no fault but innocence. Exit. Enter Giovanno, Antonio, and the old Tayler. Gi. Can this kindnesse merit your love? Doe I deserve your sister? An. My sister! worthy Tayler; 'tis a gift lyes not in me to give: aske something else, 'tis thine, although it bee gain'd with the quite extinguishing of this; this breath you gave mee. Gi. Have not Iâ An. Speake no further, I confesse you have bin all unto me, life, and being; I breath but with your licence: will no price buy out your interest in me, but her love? I tell thee Tayler, I have blood runs in mee, Spaine cannot match for greatnesse, next her Kings. Yet to requite thy love Ile call thee friend, be thou Antonio's friend; a favour nobles have thirsted for: will this requite thee? Gi. Sir this may, butâ An. My sister thou wouldst say most worthy Tayler, shee is not mine to give; honour spake in my dying Father, 'tis a sentence that's Registred here, in Antonio's heart, I must not wed her, but to one in blood calls honour Father: Prethee be my friend, forget I have a sister; in love Ile bee more than a brother; tho' not to mingle blood. Gi. May I not call her mistresse? An. As a servant, far from the thoughts of Wedlocke. Gi. I'me yours, friend I am proud on't; you shall finde, That though a Tayler, I'ave an honest mind.

O they are proud in that they rescued you, And my blood of honour; since you are pleas'd To grace the now declining Trade of Taylers, By being shrouded in their homely cloaths, And decke a Shop-board with your noble person; The taunting scornes, the foule mouth'd World, can throw upon our needfull Calling Shall be answered: They injure honour, since your honour is a Noble practitioner in our Mistery. Gi. Cheere up Antonio, take him in, The rest will make him merry; Ile goe try The temper of a sword upon some Shield That guards a foe. Pray for my good successe. Exit. 1 Tay. Come, come my Lord leave melancholy To hired slaves, that murther at a price: Yours wasâ An. No more, flatter not my sin. 1 Tay. You are too strikt a convertite, let's in. Exit. After a confused noyse within, Enter Raymond, Leonis, Gilberty hastily. Ra. What meanes this capering Eccho? Or from whence did this so lively Counterfeit Of Thunder, breake out to liberty? Gil. 'Tis from the City. Ra. It cannot be, their voyce should out-roare Iove; Our Army like a Bassiliske, has strucke Death through their eyes; our number like a wind, Broke from the Icy prison of the North, Has froze the Portalls to their shivering hearts; They scarce have breath enough to speake't: They live. A shoute within. Gil. 'Ts certainely from thence. Leo. Y'are deceived, poore Spaniards feare Ha's chang'd their elevated Gate to a dejection Their Planet strooke. Ra. 'Tis from our jocond Fleet, my Genius prompts me; They have already plough'd the unruly seas, And with their breasts, proofe 'gainst the battering Waves dasht the bigge billowes into angry froth, And spight of the contentious full mouth'd gods Of Sea and wind, have reach't the Citty frontiers, And begirt her Navigable Skirts. Againe: 'tis so. againe within. Gil. My Creeds another way; I have no faith but to the City. Alarum. Enter a Souldier bloody. Leo. Here's one, Now we shall know: ha! he appeares Like one compos'd of horrour. Ra. What speakes thy troubled front? Leo. Speak crimson Metor. Ra. Speake Prodigy, or on my sword thou fallst. Sol. The bold Spaniards, setting aside al cold acknowledgment Of any oddes, or notice of the number our Army Is made proud with, sends from their Walls More lightning, than great Iove afrights The trembling world with, when the aire Is turned to muteny. Ra. Villaine thou lyest; 'Twere madnesse to beleeve thee. Foolish Spaine, may like those Giants, that Heapt hill on hill, mountaine on mountaine, To plucke Jove from heaven, who with A hand of vengeance flung 'em downe beneath The centure, and those Cloud contemning Mounts, Heav'd by the strength of their ambitious Armes, Became their Monuments: so Spaines rash Folly, from this arme of mine, shall find their Graves amongst the rubbish of their Ruin'd Cities. Enter a second souldier. What another! thy hasty newes? 2 Mess. The daring enemies have through their gates Made a victorious salley; all our troopes Have joyntly like the dust before the wind, Made a dishonoured flight: Harke Alarum within. The Conquering foe makes hitherward. Ra. Runne to my Tent, fetch my Philippa: Slave why mov'st thou not? 2 Mess. The enemy's upon us. Ra. Shall I send thy coward soule down the strikes him. Vaults of Horrour: flye Villaine, or thou dyest. Alarum. Enter Machvill, Alerzo, Fulgentio, Pandolpho, with Philippa prisoner, Giavanno with Taylers. Mach. Let one post to my Castle, and conduct my Lady, Tell her I have a prisoner wou'd become proud In her forc't captivity to waite upon her beauty: Flye, let not the tardy clouds out-saile thee. Phil. Canst thou proud man thinke that Philipa's Heart, is humbled with her fortunes, (no didst thou Bring all the rough tortures From the worlds Child-hood) to this houre invented, And on my resolute body, proofe against paine, Practis'd Scicilian tyranny. My Gyant thoughts should like a cloud of wind, Contemning smoak, mingle with heaven: And not a looke so base, as to be pittied, shall Give you cause of triumph. Al. 'Fore heaven a fiery girle. Ful. A Masculine spirit. Pan. An Amazon. Ra. See my Philippa, her rich colour's fled and like that soule The furrow fronted Fates have made an Anvill To forge diseases on, she's lost her selfe With her fled beauty; yet pale as she stands, She addes more glory to our churlish foe, Than bashfull Tytan to the Easterne world. Spaniards, she is a Conquest; Rome, When her two neckt Eagles, aw'd the world Would have swum through their owne blood to purchase! Nor must you enjoy that jemme, the superstitious gods Would quarrell for, but through my heart. Courage brave friends, they're valiant that can flye I'th mouth of danger; 'tis they winne, though dye. Gia. This Moore speakes truth, Wrapt in a voyce of thunder. Ra. Speake, my Philippa, what untutor'd slave Durst lay a rugged hand upon thy softnesse? Phi. 'Twas the epitome of Hercules: No bigge Colossus, yet for strength farre bigger: A little person great with matchlesse Valour. Ra. What paines thou takest to praise Thine enemy. Phi. 'Twere sinne to rob him, that has wasted so His blood for praise: this noble Souldier, he 'Twas made me captive; nor can he boast 'Twas in an easie combate; for my good Sword, now ravish'd from mine arme, forc'd crimson Drops, that like a goary sweat, buryed His manly body in oblivion: those that were Skild in his Effigies, as drunke with Lethe, had Forgot 'twas hee; till by the drawing of the Ruefull curtaine they saw in him their errour. Ra. A common Souldier owner of a strength worthy Such praise? Dares he cope with the French Generall single? Phi. My Lord, you must strike quick and sure Ra. Why pause you? my Philippa must not stay, Captivity's infection. Ma. We have the day. Ra. Not till you conquer me: which if my arme Be not by Witch-craft rob'd of his late strength, Shall spinne your labour to an ample length. Ma. Upon him then. Gia. Ods is dishonourable combate: my lads Lets one to one; I am for the Moore. Ale. Thee. Ful. Tayler, you are too sawcy. Gia. Sawcy? Aler. Vntutor'd groome, Mechanicke slave. Gia. You have protection, by the Governours presence, Else my plumed Estrages, 'tis not your feathers, More waighty than your heads, should stop My vengeance, but I'de text my wrong In bloody Characters upon your pamperd flesh. Ful. You wou'd? Gia. By Heaven I would. Ful. You'd be advis'd, and render up your life a Sacrifice to patience. Gia. Musk-Cat, I'de make your Civet worship stinke first in your perfumed Buffe. Ale. Phlegmaticke slave. Gia. Bloudlesse Commanders. Fu., Pa., Ale. How. Gia. So. Fu., Pa., Ale. Let's reward his boldnesse. Ma. Whence this rashnesse? They fall upon Giavanno. Ra. Blest occation: lets on 'em. The French whisper. The French flye upon 'em: They turne to their guard, and beate 'em off.</field>

Raimond y'are now my prisoner: Blind Chance has favour'd where your thoughts, And hope she meant to ruine From our discord, which heaven has made victorious, You meant to strike a harmony should glad you. Ale. 'Tis not to be borne: a Tayler! Whisper. Ful. 'Twas an affront gales me to thinke on't: Besides his sawcy valour might have ruin'd all Our forward fortunes, had the French been Stronger: let him be banish'd. Mac. It shall be so; My feares are built on grounds Stronger than Atlas shoulders: this same Tayler Retaines a spirit like the lost Antonio; Whose sister we will banish in pretence of Love to Justice; 'tis a good snare, to trap the Vulgar hearts: his, and her goods, to guild my Lawlesse doings, Ile give the poore, whose tongues Are i' their bellies: which being full, Is tipt with heartlesse prayers; but empty, A falling Planet is lesse dangerous; they'le downe to Hell for curses. You Tayler. Gia. My Lord. Ma. Deliver up your prisoner. Gia. Y'are obey'd. Ma. So: now we command on forfeit of thy Life, you be not seene in any ground our Masters Title circles, within three daies. Such a factious spirit we must not nourish: Least like the Fables Serpent, growne warme In your conceited worth, you sting Your Countries Breasts, that nurst your valour. Gi. This my reward? Aler. More then thy worth deserves. Gi. Pomander boxe thou lyest. Ful. Goe purge your selfe; your Country vomits you. Gi. Slaves y' are not worth my anger. Ful. Goe vent your spleene 'mongst Satyres, pen a Pamphlet, and call't the Scourge of greatnesse. Aler. Or Spaines ingratitude. Gi. Yee are not worth my breath, Else I should curse you; but I must weepe, Not that I part form thee unthankfull Spaine, But my Evadne, well, it must bee so: Heart keepe thy still tough temper spight of woe.

Famist master? nay faith and a Tayler Come to be famisht, 'tis a hard World: No bread in this world here hoe, to save The renowned Corps of a Tayler from famishing? 'Tis no matter for drinke, give me bread. 2 Tay. Thou hast a gut wou'd swallow a pecke Loafe. 3 Tay. I marry wou'd it with vantage; I tell truth, And as the Proverbe sayes, shame the Divell; If our Hell afford a Divell, but I see none Unlesse he appeare in a delicious remnant of Nim'd Sattin, and by my faith that's a courteous Divill, that suffers the Brokers to hang him In their ragged Ward robe; and us'd to sell his Divelship for mony: I tell truth, a Tayler And lye, faith I scorne that. 1 Tay. Leave your discovery. 3 Tay. Master, a Traveller you know is famous for lying, And having travelled as farre as hell; May not I make description of the unknowne Land? 1 Tay. My braine is busie, Sebastiano must not tread an unknowne Land To finde out a Grave; unfortunate Sebastiano, First to lose thy selfe in a disguise, unfitting for thy Birth, and then thy Country for thy too much vallour: There's danger in being vertuous, in this Age Led by those sinfull Actors, the plunged stage, Of this vice-bearing World, would head-long fall But charitable vertue beares up all. I must invent, I ha't, so: As he's a Tayler; he is banisht Spaine, As Sebastiano 'tis revokt againe. Exit cum fuis. Enter Machvile solus. Ma. How subtile are my springes, they take all? With what swift speed unto my Chaffie baite Doe all Fowles fly, unto their hasty ruine? Clap, clap your wings, and flutter greedy fooles, Whilst I laugh at your folly; I have a Wier Set for the Moore, and his ambitious Consort; Which if my wife wo'd second, they are sure. Enter Auristella. Au. What must she second? Mach. Art thou there my Love? we're in a path That leades us to a height, we may confront The Sun, and with a breath extinguish common Starres; be but thou rul'd, the light That does create day to this City Must be derived from us. Au. You fire my soule, and to my airy Wings, add quicker Feathers: what taske Wo'd not I run, to be cald Queene? Did the life blood of all our Family, Father and Mother, stand as a quicke wall To stop my passage to a Throne, I'de with a Puniard ope their Azure veines, And squeese their active blood up into Clods, Till they become as cold as winters snow; And as a bridge upon their trunkes i'de goe. Ma. Our soules are twinnes, and thirst with equall heat For Deity: Kings are in all things Gods Saving mortality. Au. To be a Queene, what danger wo'd I run? I'de spend my life like to a Bare-foot Nun; So I might sit above the lesser starrs Of small Nobility, but for a day. Mach. 'Tis to be done sweet love an nearer way; I have already with the suger'd baites Of Justice, liberallity, and all The Foxe like ginns, that subtile Statse-men Set to catch the hearts o'th giddy multitude: Which if it faile, as cautious policy Forbids, I build too strongly on their drunke Uncertaine Votes, I'de have thee breake with My great Prisoners Wife, as I will Doe with him; promise the states equall Devided halfe himselfe shall rule: So that if need compell us to take Armes, We may have forces from the Realme of France, To seate us in the Chaire of Government. Au. I never shall indure to walke as equall With proud Philippa, no; my ambitious soule Boyles in a thirsty flame of totall glory: I must be all, without a second flame To dim our luster. Mach. Still my very soule, thinkest thou I can indure Compeditor, or let an Ethiope sit by Machvils side, As partner in his honour? no, as I have seene I 'the Common-wealth of Players, one that did act The Thebane Creon's part; with such a life I became ravisht, and on Raimond meane, To plot what he did one the caveling boyes of Oedipus, Whilst we graspe the whole dignity. Au. As how sweet Machvile? Mach. It is not ripe my love, The King I heare applauds my justice: Wherefore I have sent order that Count Antonio Once being taken, be sent to Fill-ford Mill; There ground to death. Au. What for his wife? Mach. Thy envy: she I have banisht, And her goods to guard a shower of curses From my head, I'ave given the poore. Au. Good pollicy, let's home to our designes: I hate to be officious, 'yet my frowne Shall be dissolv'd to flattery for a Crowne. Exit. Mach. Attend your Ladyâso her forward spleene, Tickled with thought of greatnesse makes the Scene attempts run smooth: the haughty Moore shall bee the Lader, on whose servile backe Ile mount to greatnesse. If calme peace deny me easie way. Rough War shall force it, which done, Raimond And his Philippa must goe seeke an Empire in Elizium; for to rule, predominance belongs Alone to me: slaves are unworthy rule, What state wo'd set a Crowne upon a a Mule? Exit Antonio disguis'd sitting in a Closet. My soule is heavy, and my eye-lids feele The weighty power of lazy Morpheus: Each element that breathes a life within me Runs a contrary course, and conspire To counterfeit a Chaos: whilst the frame And weake supporters of my inward man (Cracke) as beneath the weight of Atlas burthen: A suddaine change, how my blear'd eye-lids strive To force a sleepe 'gainst nature. O yon Powers That rule the better thoughts, if you have ought To act on my fraile body, let it be with eagles Speed; or if your wills so please, Let my fore past and undejested wrongs O're whelme my thoughts, and sinke me to the ground With their no lesse then deaths remembrances. Cease bastard slave, to clog my sences With the leaden weights of an unwilling sleepe; unlesse Thy raw-bon'd brother joyne his force, and make A seperation twixt my aiery soule, And my all earthly body: I am o're come, heaven worke your wills, my breath, Submits to this as 'twould submit to death.

Enter from one side death, and from the other side Aurelia, Death strikes three times at Antonio, and Aurelia diverts it. Exit severally. What this same shadow seemes to be, In Flanders thou shalt reall see; The Maid that seem'd to conquer Death, And give thee longer lease of breath, Dotes on thy aire; report hath bin Lavish in praysing thee unseene. Make hast to Flanders, time will be Accus'd of slothfulnesse, if she Be longer tortur'd: doe not stay, My power shall guide thee on the way. assended. Enter Giovanno and the old Tayler. Gio. He is asleepe. Old Tay. See how he strugles, as if some visions Had assum'd a shape fuller of horrour Then his troubled thoughts. Gio. His conscience gripes him to purpose: see he wakes; Let us observe. Ant. Stay gentle power, leave Hostage that thy promise Thou'lt performe, And I will offer to thy Diety More then my lazy heart has offer'd yet. But stay Antonio, can thy easie faith Give credit to a dreame? an aiery vision, Fram'd by strangling fancy, to delude weake Sence with a gay nothing? recollect thy selfe, Advise thee by thy feares, it may force hence This midnights shade of griefe; And guild it with a morne as full of joy. As do's bright PhÃ¦bus to our Easterne World, When blushing he arises from the lap Of Sea-greene Thetis to give a new day birth. Gio. Why how now friend, what talking to thy selfe? Ant. O Giovanno 'tis my unpartiall thoughts, That rise in war against my guilty conscience; O it stings me! Old Tay. Be more a man, shrinke not beneath a weight So light, a child may beare it; for beleeve me, If my Propheticke feare deceive me not, You had done an act, Spaine should for ever praise Had you kild Machvile to. Ant. As how good Master? I must call you so; This is your Livery. Old. O y'are a noble Tayler. But to Machvile It was my chance, being sent for by his wife To take the measure of their noble prisoner; Who when I came was busie, being plac'd Into a roome, where I might easily heare Them talke of Crownes, and Kingdomes; And of two that should be partners in this End of Spaine. Gio. Who were they? Old. Machvile and Raimond, at last Machvile laught Saying, for this I made the Governour To crosse Antonio at the Counsell bord: Knowing that one must, if not both sho'd dye. Ant. Did he say this? Old. He did, and added more under a feigned show Of love to Justice, banisht your sister. Gio. Is Evadne banisht? Old. She is, and as I ghesse to Flanders, her woman too has left her. Ant. Nay droope not friend; Host, pray tell proud Machvile, I have a sword left to chastise A Traitor: come, let's goe seeke Evadne. Gio. O Antonio, the suddaine griefe almost distracts Thy friend; but come, let's goe each severall, And meete at Fill-ford: if thou findest Evadne, Beare her unto the Castle. Exit. Ant. Farewell good master. Exit. Old. O you honour me. Bootelesse were all perswasions, they'le not stay. I'le to the King; this treason may become Like a disease, out of the reach of Phisicke: And may infect past care if let alone. Exit. Enter Raymond and Philippa. Phi. Erect thy head my Raymond, be more tall Then daring Atlas, but more safely wise: Sustaine no burthen but the politicke care Of being great; till thou at obeiye the Cities Axeltree, and wave it as thou list. Ray. Hast thou no skill in Magick, that thou hits So just upon my thoughts, thy tongue is tipt Like Natures miracle; that drawes the steele With unresisted violence: I can not keepe A secret to my selfe, but thy prevailing Rhetoricke ravishes and leaves my breast Like to an empty Casket, that once was blest With keeping of a Iewell I durst not trust the Ayre with, 'twas so precious: pray be carefull. Phi. You doe not doubt me? Ray. No, were you a woman made of such course ingrediance as the common, which in our triveall phrase we call meere women; I wou'd not trust thee with a Cause so weighty, that the discovery did indanger this, this haire; that when 'tis gone a Linxes cannot misse it: but you areâ I want expressions, 'tis not common words can speake you truely, you are more than woman. Phi. My Lord you know my temper, and how to Win upon my heart. Ray. I must be gone, and post a messenger, France must supply what wants to make thee great; An Army my Philippa, which these people Snoring in pride of their last victory, Doe not so much as dreame on? Nor shall, till they be forced to yeeld their voyces At our election; which will be ere long. Phi. O 'tis an age, I'de rather have it sed, Philippa then a prisoner were dead. Exit. Enter a Crimenall Iudge and Officers, with Antonio, Pertrucio and Aurelio meete him with servants. Iud. Captaine Petruchio, take this condemned man Into your charge, it is Antonio once a Spanish Count, till his rash folly, with his Life made forfeit of his honour; he Was found travelling to your Castle, 'Twas Heavens will that his owne feet Should with a willing pace conduct him to his ruine: For the murther he must be ground to death In Filford Mill, of which you are the Governour: Here my Commission in its end gives strength to yours, He's your charge: farewell, His death must be with speed. Exit with his. Ant. Deceive me not good glasses, your lights In my esteeme never till now was precious, 'Tis the same, I 'tis the very same I sleeping saw. Au. Is this the man Fame speakes so nobly of? O love, Aurelio never untill now Could say he knew thee; I must desemble it. Pet. Come sir to my Castle. Au. Fie on you sir, to kill a Governour it is a fact Death cannot appeare too horrible to punish. Ant. Can this be truth? O shallow, shallow man To credit aire, beleeve there can be substance In a cloud of thickned-smoake, as truth hid in a dreame; Yes there is truth, that like a serowle fetcht from An Oracle, betrayes the double dealing of the gods; Dreames that speake all of joy, doe turne to griefe, And such bad Fate deludes my light beleefe. Pet. Away with him Exeunt. Aurelius solus. Oft have I heard my brother with a tongue Proud of the Office, prais'd this lovely Lord; And my trapt soule did with as eager hast Draw in the breath, and now: O Aurelia, Buried with him must all thy joy thou hast For ever sleepe; and with a pale consumption, Pittying him wilt thou thy selfe be ruin'd? He must not dye, if there be any way Reveal'd to the distressed, I will find it: Assist a poore lost Virgin some good power, And lead her to a path, whose secret tract May guide both him and me unto our safety. Be kind good wits, I never untill now Put you to any trouble; 'tis your Office, To helpe at need this little world you live by: Not yet! O dulnesse! doe not make me madâ I hav't blest braine; now shall a womans wit Wrestle with Fate, and if my plot but hit: Come off with wreaths, my duty nay may all, I must forsake lest my Anionio fall.

Not finde Evadne! sure some wanton wind Has snacht her from the earth into the aire; Smooth Zephers faines the tresses of her haire, Whilst slicke Favonions playes the fawning slave; And hourely dyes, making her breasts his grave: O false Evadne, is Giovanno's love That has out-done all merrit for thy sake So light, that winde out-weighs it? No, no; no; Evadne is all vertue, Sweet as the breath of Roses; and as chast, As Virgin Lillies in their infancy: Downe you deluding Ministers of Ayre: Evadne is not light, though she be faire: Dissolve that counterfeit: ha, ha, ha, ha. See how they shrinke: why so, now I will love you: Goe search into the hollowes of the earth, And finde my love, or I will chaine you up To eternity: see, see; who's this? O I know him now.

Here on a Wheele, turn'd by a Furies hand, Hangs a distracted States-man, that had spent The little wit Heaven to strange purpose lent him, To suppresse right, make beggers, and get meanes To be a Traytor. Ha, ha, ha, and here A Vsurer fat with the curses of so many heires His Extortion had undone, sate to the Chin In a warme bath, made of new melted gold; And now and then a draught past through his throat: He fed upon his god; but he being angry Scalded his Chops. Right against him Stood a fool'd Gallant, chain'd unto a post, And lasht by Folly for his want of wit.

Evadne is flye-blowne, I cannot love her. Evad. What say you sweet? Gio. The innocence that sits upon that face Sayes she is chast, the guilty cannot speake So evenly as she does: guilty, said I! Alas it were not her fault, were she ravish't. O madnesse, madnesse, whither wilt thou beare me? Evad. His sences are unsetled; Ile goe seeke Some holy man to rectifie his wits. Sweet will you goe unto some Hermits Cell? You looke as you lackt rest. Gio. She speaks like to an Angel, she's the same As when I saw her first, as pure, as chast. Did she retaine the substance of a sinner, For she is none, her breath wo'd then be sower, And betray the rankenesse of the act but Her chast sighes beget as sweet a dew As that of May. Why weepes Evadne, truely I'me not mad? See, I am tame, pray leade me where you please. Exeunt. A Banquet is set forth: Enter Petruchio, Aurelia, with two servants bringing Antonio a sleepe in a Chaire, and set him to the Table. Pet. The drinke has done its part effectually, 'Twas a strong powder that could hold his sences So fast that this removing, so full of noise, Had not the power to wake him. Aur. Good Father let Aurelia, your daughter, Doe this same act of Justice; let me tread the pin: The fact of his being so foule, so hatefull, Has lent me though a maid such fortitude. Pet. Thou hast thy wish, do't boldly, 'tis a deed That in the ignorance of elder ages, Wou'd be thought full of merit: Be not daunted. Aur. I have a thought tel's me it is religious, To sacrifice a murtherer to death; Especially one that did act a deed, So generally accounted odious. Pet. By holy (Iaques) I'me a governour, And should my life, (though by the hand of him My duty does call King) be stroke i'th aire; My injur'd corps should not forsake the earth Till I did see't reveng'd: be resolute; thy foot Is guided by a power, that though unseene, Is still a furtherer of good attempts. Aur. Pray sir lend me the Key of the backe ward, For though my conscience tells me 'tis an act I may hereafter boast off; yet ile passe unto our Ladies Chappell when 'tis done, to be confest Ere I am seene of any. Pet. I am proud to see thee so well given. Take 'em girle, and with 'em take my prayers. Aur. He wakes, pray leave me sir. Exit Pet. So Ile make fast the doore, Goodnesse beare witnesse 'tis a potent power Out-weighs my duty. Ant. Amazement! on what tentors doe you stretch? O how this alteration wracks my reason, i'me To find the Axeltree on which it hangs? Am I asleepe? Aur. Shake thy wonder off, and leave that seate, 'Twas set to sinke thy body for ever From the eyes of humane sight; To tell thee how wou'd be a fatall meanes To both our ruinesâbriefly my love Has broke the Bands of nature with my father, To give you being. Ant. Happy, happy vision, the blest preparative To this same houre, my joy wo'd burst me else. Aur. Receive me to thy armes. Ant. I wou'd not wish to live but for thee, life were A trouble; welcome to my soule. Ant. Stand, I have a Ceremony, to offer to our Safety, ere we goe. She takes a Dogge and tyes it to the Chaire, shee stampes: The Chaire and Dogge descends, a Pistoll shot within: a noise of a Mill. Had not my love like a kind branch Of some o're looking tree, catcht thee, Thou'dst fallen, never to looke upon the world againe. Ant. What shall I offer to my lifes preserver? Aur. Onely thy heart, Crown'd with a wreath of love, Which I will ever keepe; and in exchange Deliver mine. Ant. Thus I deliver, in this kisse receive't. Aur. In the same forme Aurelia yeelds up hers. Ant. What noise is that? A noise. Aur. I feare my Father. Ant. What's to be done? Aur. Through the backe ward, of which I have The Key; weele suddainly make scape, Then in two Gownes of which I am provided, Weele cloath our selves till we be past all feare. Ant. Be't as you please, 'tis my good genious will Thee I obey: command, ile follow still. Exeunt. Enter Petruchio with servants. Pet. She's gone unto her prayers, may every bead Draw downe a blessing on her; that like seed May grow into a Harvest: 'tis a girle My age is proud of; she's indeed the Modell Of her dead Mothers vertues, as of shape. Beare hence this Banquet. Exit with the Banquet. Giovanno is discovered sleeping in the lap of Evadne. Evad. Thou silent god, that with the leaden Mace Arresteth all (save those prodigious birdes) That are Fates Heraulds to proclaime all ill; Deafe Giovanno, let no fancied noyse Of ominous Screech-owles, or night Ravens voyce Affright his quiet sences: let his sleepe Be free from horrour, or unruly dreames; That may beget a tempest in the streames Of his calme reason: let 'em run as smooth, And with as great a silence, as those doe That never tooke an injury; where no wind Had yet acquaintance: but like a smooth Cristall, Dissolv'd into a water that never frown'd, Or knew a voyce but musicke. Enter Antonio and Aurelia in Hermits gownes. Holy Hermits, for such your habits speake you, Joyne your prayers with a distressed Virgins; That the wits of this distracted yong man May be setled. Ant. Sure 'tis my sister, and that sleeping man Giovanno. She loves him still. Hee wakes. Gio. O what a blessednesse am I bereft of! What pleasure has the least part of a minute Stollen from my eyes: me thought I did imbrace A Brother and a friend; and both Antonio. Evad. Blest be those gentle powers thatâ Gio. What Evadneâhave deceived my eyes, Take heede Evadne, worship not a dreame, 'Tis of a smoaky substance, and will shrinke Into the compasse of report; that 'twas: And not reward the labour of a word Were it substantiall: Could I now but see That man, of men; i'de by my practice Of Religious prayers, add to the Kalender One Holy-day, and keepe it once a yeare. Ant. Behold Antonio. Evad. Brother. To Antonio. Aur. Brother. To Giovanno. Ant. What earth-quake shakes my heart, With what a speed she flew into his armes! Evad. Some power that hearkens to the prayer of virgins, Has bin distill'd to pitty at my Fortunes; And made Evadne happy. Aur. Now my longing that was growne big, Is with your sight delivered of a joy, That will become a Giant; and overcome me. Welcome, thrice welcome brother. Ant. Ha, her brother! Fortune has bound me So much in their debts, I must dispaire to pay 'em: Twice has my life bin by these twins of goodnesse Pluckt from the hand of death; that fatall emnity Betweene our houses here shall end, Though my Father at his death commanded me To eternity of hatred: What tye binds stronger then Reprieve from death? Come hither friend; now brother, take her, Thou hast bin a noble Tayler. Gio. Be moderate my joyes, doe not o're whelme me Here take Aurelia, may you live happy: O Antonio this, this was the cause of my disguise; Sebastine could not win Evadne's love, But Giovanno did; come now to our fathers Castle. Ant. Pardon me; there is a barre that does Concerne my life forbids you as a friend, To thinke on going to any place But to, the Taylers house, which is not farre: Come, as we goe I will relate the cause. Aur. Doe good brother. Evad. Goe good Sebastiano. Gio. Sebastine is your Page, and bound to follow, Leade on. Ant. O noble temper I admire thee! may The world bring forth such Taylers every day. Exeunt. Enter three Taylers on a Shop-board. 1 Tay. Come, come let's worke; For if my guesses point the right, we sha'nt Worke long. 3 Tay. I care not how soone, for I have a notable Stomacke to bread. 2 Tay Dost heare, I suspect that Courtier my master Brought in last night, to be the King; Which if it be bullies, all the bread in the Towne sha'nt satisfie us, for we will eate Cum Privelegio. 1 Tay. Come let's have a device, a thing, a song Boy. 3 Tay. Come an aireâ The Song. 1 Tay, 'Tis a merry life we live, All our worke is brought unto us; Still are getting, never give, For their Cloaths all men doe woe us: Yet unkind they blast our Names, With aspertions of dishonour: For which we make bold with their Dames, When we take our measure on her. All Tay. For which wee; &amp;c. Enter Antonio, Giovanno, and she told Tayler, Old Tay. You see the life we live; cease. Ant. O 'tis a merry one. Gio. It is no newes to me, I have bin us'd to't. Old Tay. Now for discovery, the King as yet Is ignorant of your names, and shall be Till your merits beg your pardon. My Lord you are for Machvile, take this gowne. Ant. Pray for successe. Exit Ant. Old Tay. You in this French disguise for proud Philippa; This is her garment. I heare the King, be gone: The French mans folly sit upon your tongue. Exeunt. Enter the King, Evadne and Aurelia. King. Beleeve me Tayler you have out-stript the Court, For such perfections lives not every where; Nature was vext as she's a very shrew, She made all others in an angry mood; These onely she can boast for Master-peeces: The rest want something or in mind or forme, These are precisely made: a Critticke Jury, Of cavelliing Arts cannot condemne a scruple. Aur. But that your entrance in this formall speech Betray'd you are a Courtier; I had bin angry At your Ranke flattery. King. Can you say so? Evad. Sir, she has spoke my meaning. King. Friend, what are those beauties cald? aside. Old Tay. Your graces pardon. King. Are they Oracle, or is the knowledge fatall? But that I know thy faith, this deniall Wou'd conjure a suspition in my breast; Vse thy prerogative, 'tis thy owne house In which you are a King; and I your guest. Come Ladies. Exeunt. Enter Antonio disguis'd like a Physitian. This habite will doe well, and lesse suspected; Rapt i' this cover lives a Kingdomes plague, They kill with licence; Machviles proud dame 'Tis fam'd is ficke, upon my soule, how ere Her health may be the Aguesh commons cry; She's a disease they groane for: this disguise Shall sift her Ebon soule, and if she be Infectious, like a Meagrome, or rot limbe; The sword of Justice must devide the joynt That holds her to the States indanger'd body. Shee comes. Enter Machvile, with Auristella leaning on his arme, with two, Seruants. Mach. Looke up my Auristella; Better the Sun forsake his course to blesse, With his continuing beames the Antipodes, And we grovell for ever in eternall night, Then death ecclipse thy rich and stronger light. Seeke some physitian, horrour to my soule, she faints; I'de rather lose the issue of my hopes, than Auristella. Ant. Issue of his hopes, strange; aside. Mach. The Crownes injoynement can yeeld no content, Without the presence of my Auristilla. Ant. Crownes injoyment, O villaine. Mach. Why stirre you not? fetch me some skillfull man, My Kingdome shall reward him; if his Art Chaine her departing soule unto her flesh, But for a day, till she be crown'd a Queene: Fly, bring him unto this walke. Ant. Stay, Most honour'd Count, (now for a forged linke aside. Of flattery to chaine me to his love;) Having with studious care gone o're the Art Folly tearmes Magick, which more sublime soules Skil'd i' the Starrs, know is above that mischiefe; I finde you're borne to be 'bove vulger greatnesse, Even to a Throne: but stay, let's fetch this Lady. Mach. All greatnesse without her is slavery. Ant. Vse modest violence. Au. Oh. Ant. Stand wider, give her aire. Mach. God-like Physitian, I and all that's mine, Will at thy feet offer a sacrifice. Ant. Fore fend it goodnesse; I, nay all; E're many houres makes the now yong day A type of sparkeling youth; shall on their knees Pray for your highnesse. Mach. Looke up my Auristella, and be great; Rise with the Sun, but never to decline, Aur. What have you done? Mach. Wak'd thee to be a Queene. Aur. A Queene! O don't dissemble; you have rob'd me Of greater pleasure, than the fancied blisse Elizium ownes: O for a pleasure reall, that Wo'd appeare in all unto my dreame: that I may Frowne, and then kill; smile, and create againe. Were there a Hell, as doting age wo'd have, To fright from lawlesse courses heedlesse youth: For such a short liv'd happinesse as that, I wo'd be lost unto eternity. Mach. The day growes old in houres: Come Auristella to the Capitall; The Gray-beard Senate shall on humble knees, Pay a Religious Sacrifice of praise Unto thy demy Deity: the Starrs Have in a generall Senate made thee Queene Of this our world: Great master of thy Art, Confirme my love. Ant. Madamâ Mach. Nay heare him love, beleeve me he's a man That may be Secretary to the gods; He is alone in Art, 'twere sin to name A second; all are dunces to him. Ant. How easie is the faith of the ambitious. Mach. Follow me to the Counsell. Exit. Au. Are you the man my husband speakes so high of? Are you skill'd i'the Starres? Ant. Yes Madam. Au. Your habit sayes, or you abuse the custome, You're a Physitian? Ant. Madam i'me both. Au. And dee' find no let that stops my rysing. Ant. Not any. Au. Away, your skill is dull, dul to dirision. There is a Star fixt i'the heaven of greatnesse, That sparkles with a rich and fresher light, Than our sicke and defective Taper. Ant. It may be so, the horiscope is troubled; Au. Confusion take your horiscope and you. Can you with all your Art advise my feares, How to confound this constellation. Ant. Death how she conjures; Madam I must search into the Planets. Au. Planet me no planets; be a Physitian, And from your study of industrious poisons, Fetch me your best experienc'd speedy one, And bring it to me straight: what 'tis to doe, Like unresolved riddles hid from you. Exit. Ant. Planet said I; upon my life no planet Is so swift as her nere resting evill, That's her tongue: well i'le not question What the poisons for, if for her selfe, The common Hangman's eas'd the labour of a blow, For if she live her head must certaine off; The poison ile goe get, and give it her, Then to the King: If Sebastiano's Frenchified disguise Purchase the like discovery, our eyes Will be too scanty; we had need to be All eye, to watch such haughty villany. Exit. Enter Giovanno and Philippa. Gio. Begare Madam me make de gowne so brave; O, de nole vorle vorke be me patron, me ha vorke for le grand Duches le Shevere, le Royne de Francia, Spanea de Angleter an all d' fine Madamosels. Phi.

Enter Raimond. Phi. Welcome my Lord, Shall I still long, yet lose my longing still? Is there no Art to mount the lofty seat? No Engin that may make us ever great? Must we be still stil'd Subjects, and for feare Our closest whispers reach the a wing care, Not trust the wind? Ray. Be calme my love, Ha, who have we here an eues dropper. Gio.

Some happy genius does attend my wishes, Or spirit like a Page conducts unto me The Ministers, whose sweet must seat me easie. Come hither French man, canst thou rule thy tongue? Art not too much a woman? Gio. No begar me show, someting for de man. Ray. Or canst thou be like a perverse on, professe dogednes?

Marke, 'tis Raimond sayes it: And as I live, I breath not, if my deedes Appeare not in a horrour 'bove my words. Gio.

Gio. Folly goe from my tongue, the French so nigh, And thou halfe ruin'd Spaine, so wretchedly provided; Strange, yet not, all Countries have bread monsters: 'Tis a Proverbe as plaine as true, and aged as 'tis both: One tainted Sheepe mares a whole flocke. Machvile that tainted beast, whose spreading ills Infecteth all; and by infecting kills. Ile to the French, what he intends to be Our ruine; shall confound their villany. Exit.</field>

Aur. Evad. old Tay. To finish thy damnation. King. Accursed villaine, thou hast murther'd him That holds not one small drop of loyall blood: But what is worth thy life. Evad. O my brother. Gio. Give him some ayre, the wound cannot be mortall. Au. Alas he faints, O my Antonio: Curst Machvile, may thy souleâ Ant. Peace, peace Aurelia; be more mercifull: Men are apt to censure, and will condemne Thy passion, call it madnesse, and say thou Wantst Religion: nay weepe not sweet, For every one must dye: it was thy love, For to deceive the Law, and give me life: But death you see has reacht me, O, I dye; Blood must have blood, so speakes the Law of Heaven: I slew the Governour, for which rash deed: Heaven, fate, and man, thus make Antonio bleed. Dyes. Mach. Sleepe, sleepe great heart, thy vertue made me ill Authors of vice, 'tis fit the vitious kill: But yet forgive me, Oh, my great heart Dissolves like snow, and lessons to a Rhume, Cold as the envious blasts of Notherne wind: World how I lov'd thee, 'twere a sin to boast; Farewell, I now must leave thee; my life Growes empty with my veines: I cannot stand, my breath Is as my strength, weake; and both seaz'd by death: Farewell ambition catching at a Crowne, Death tript me up, and head-long threw me downe. Dyes. King. So falls an exhalation from the sky, And's never mist because unnaturall; A birth begotten by incorporate ill: Whose usher to the gazing World is wonder. Enter Petruchio. Alas good man, thou'rt come unto a sight Will try thy temper, whether joy or griefe Shall Conquer most within thee; joy lyes here Scater'd in many heapes: these when they liv'd, Threatned to teare this balsome from our brow, And rob our Majesty of this Elyxar: points to his Crowne. I'st not my right? was not I heire to Spaine? Pet. You are our Prince, and may you live Long to injoy your right. King. But now looke here, 'tis plaine griefe has a hand Harder than joy; it presseth out such teares. Nay rise. Pet. I doe beseech your Grace not to thinke me Contriver of Antonio's scape from death, 'Twas my disloyall daughters breach of duty. King. That's long since pardon'd. Pet. You're still mercifull. King. Antonio was thy sonne, I sent for thee For to confirme it, but he is dead: Be mercyfull, and doe not curse the hand That gave it him, though it deserve it. Au. O my griefes, are you not strong enough To breake my heart? pray tell me, tell me true; Can it be thought a sin? or is it so, By my owne hand to ease my breast of woe? King. Alas poore Lady; rise, thy Father's here. Pet. Looke up Aurelia, ha, why doe you kneele? Gio. For a blessing. Pet. Why she is not Aurelia, doe not mocke me. King. But he is Sebastiano and your sonne; Late by our hand made happy by injoying The faire Evadne dead Antonio's sister: For whose sake he became a Tayler, And so long liv'd in that meane disguise. Pet. My joy had bin too great if he had liv'd, The thrifty heaven's mingle our sweets with gall; Least being glutted with excesse of good, We should forget the giver. Rise Sebastiano With thy happy choise, mayst thou live crown'd With the injoyment of those benifits, My prayers shall beg for: rise Aurelio, And in some place blest with religious prayers, Spend thy left Remnant. Au. You advise well: indeed it was a fault So breake the bonds of duty, and of law; But love, O Love; thou whose all conquering power, Builds Castles on the hearts of easie maides, And makes 'em strong unto attempt those dangers: That but rehearst before, wo'd fright their soules Into a Jelly. Brother, I must leave you; And Father, when I send to you a note, that shall Desire a yearely stipend to that holy place My tyred feet has found to rest them in; Pray confirme it. And now great King Aurelia begs of you, To grace Antonio in the mournefull March Unto his grave, which be where you thinke fit: We need not be inter'd both in one Vault. King. Blest Virgin, thy desires I will performe. Au. Then I leave you, my prayers shall still attend you As I hope yours shall accompany me. Father your blessing, and ere long expect To heare where I am entertain'd a Nunne Brother, and Sister, to you both adue; Antonio dead, Aurelia marries new. Exit. Pet. Farewell girle, when I remember thee, The Beades I drop shall be my teares. Enter Vermine in a Cloake for the Prologue. King. She's to all virgins a true mirror; They that wo'd behold true love, reflect on her: There 'tis ingross'd. 3 Tay. Great King, our Graceâ Old Tay. The King is sad, you must not act. 3 Tay. How? not act? Shall not Vermine act? Old Tay. Yes you shall act, but not now; The King is indispos'd. 3 Tay. Well then, some other time; I Virmine The King will act before the King. Old. Very good, pray make your Exit. 3 Tay. Ile muster up all the Taylers in the The King and Gio. whisper. Towne, and so tickle their sides. Old. Nay thou'rt a right Virmine, goe be not Troublesome. Exit Virmine. Gio. Upon my truth and loyalty great King, What they did was but fain'd, meerely words Without a heart: 'twas by Antonio's Counsell. King. Thou art all truth: rise. The Colonells kneele. Omnes. Long live King Philip in the calme of peace, To exercise his Regall Clemency. King. Take up Antonio's body, and let the rest Finde Christian buriall: mercy befits a King, Come trusty Tayler, And to all Countries let swift Fame report, King Philip made a Taylers house his Court. Old. Your grace much honours me. King. We can't enough pay thy alone deserts, Kings may be poore, when Subjects are like thee, So fruitfull in all loyall vertuous deeds: March with the Body we'le performe all Rights, Of sable Ceremony: that done, We'le to our Court, since all our owne is won. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
