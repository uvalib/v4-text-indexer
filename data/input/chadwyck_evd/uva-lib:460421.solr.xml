      <field name="fulltext">MERLIN; OR, The Devil of Stone-Henge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE, Containing a succinct Account of STONE-HENGE and MERLIN. The Scene, in this Entertainment, opening with a Prospect of Stone-henge, a stupendous Pile of Stone so well known by Name to Thousands that have never seen it, and which has employ'd the Enquiries of so many learned Antiquaries; it was judg'd proper to give here some little Account of what has been said concerning this celebrated Place. As Custom, in Pantomimes, has made it a Sort of Necessity, in order to give Tricks some Air of Probability, that Harlequin should be a Piece of a Magician; the Inventor of this Entertainment seems to have judg'd right, in calling a Place into his Scenary, which, Tradition and Superstition would persuade us, ow'd its Original to Magick. About six Miles North of Salisbury, on the Plains, is to be seen this wild kind of Structure, as Camden calls it. Within a Trench are placed huge unhewn Stones, in several Circles, one within another: Some whereof are eight and twenty Foot in height, and seven in breadth; on which others, like Architraves, are borne up athwart, so that it seems to be a hanging Pile: And thence some Historians have thought, it deriv'd its Name of Stone-henge. It has been reckon'd among one of the Wonders of our Nation; it being unaccountable how such Stones should come there, (as all that Country wants ordinary Stones for Building) and by what means they were rais'd. It has been the Suspicion of Some on this Account, that these Stones never were the natural Product of any Quarry, but artificial ones, compos'd of fine Sand cemented together by a glutinous sort of Matter. This Opinion, however, has been exploded; and others have affirm'd, that they are purely natural. Other Legends tell us, that in the Fifth Century of Christianity, Hengist the Saxon, with a select Number of his Party, demanding a Parley with Vortigern the Briton and an equal Number of his Friends, on Salisbury Plains, at which, on a Word given, all the Britons were treacherously slain: When Aurelius Ambrosius and his Brother Uter Pendragon soon after return'd into Britain, to perpetuate the Memory of that infamous Slaughter, Uter was sent with 15000 Men to fetch these Stones out of Ireland, and this Monument was erected and call'd Stan-hengest, or the Rock of Hengist. In Support of this Tradition it has been alledg'd, that, in the Neighbourhood of this remarkable Pile, there is a Village call'd Ambresbury, or Ambrosius's Town; and that, by digging very near the Place where the Remains of this Monument now stand, there have been found Pieces of old-fashion'd Armour, and the Bones of Men of a large Size. Others have conjectur'd this Pile to be the Ruin of some Roman Temple, of the Tuscan Order, round, and open, without any Roof: erected either to their Gods Cœlus, or Terminus: But that it could not be built by the Romans, is evident from the Rudeness of the whole Work: Besides, it is six or seven Miles from any Roman Stations; nor are any of their Inscriptions or Coins found near this Place. Others have thought, that it was a Temple of our Druids long before the coming in of the Romans. Some, that it was a Triumphal British Monument, erected to Anaraith the Goddess of Victory: And Some, that it was a Monument rais'd in Memory of Queen Boadicia: Some, that it was a Burying-Place for British Kings, a Court of Judicature, a Place of Meeting to treat of War and Peace: Others, that it was a Trophy of some Danish Victory. And They, who have been zealous to give it the Reputation of still higher Antiquity, make it to be of Phœnician Original. The Structure being of the Tuscan Order, and so purely Italian, has been no Bar to the Probability of this Opinion: because the Tuscans, it seems, were of Tyrian Extraction, and might bring with them from Phœnicia into Italy that Order of Building. And what one Colony of Phœnicians carried into Italy, might not another, by a Parity of Reasoning, bring into our Britain?— What will not Men of Whim and Fancy alledge, in Support of their own extravagant Conceptions! As all, that has been advanc'd towards an Enquiry into the Original of this ancient Monument, is without any Certainty, and founded on Conjecture and Fable; I must not omit another Tradition, which exceeds all the other Accounts in the fabulous part; but which, notwithstanding, has been handed down to us with much Monkish Solemnity, and has obtain'd Credit thro' every succeeding Generation. Our British Merlin, (who, on Account of his being an excellent Mathematician, and his having wrote an Allegory on the Philosopher's Stone, was thought to have been exquisite in the hidden Mysteries of Magick, and thence obtain'd the Name of a Prophet and Conjurer;) has been accounted the Son of a King's Daughter. She, finding herself with Child, gave it out, either to excuse her Folly in a weak and credulous Age, or, by concealing her Gallant's Name, to save his Life, that she had been embraced by an Incubus or Demon. From the Report of this preposterous Congression, Merlin was constantly look'd upon as the Devil's Son; and having the Gifts of Magick in him by Right of Descent, when his Mother died, he convey'd her Body to Salisbury Plains, interr'd her there, and, as a Monument in honour of her, erected the Pile call'd Stone-henge. To make it the more signal, the Cross-Stones are fix'd without Mortar or Cement, supported only by Tenons and Mortises, and the whole rang'd in so perplex'd an Order, that it has not been possible, according to Tradition, exactly to number them. Nay, a Baker is said to have brought Loaves in a Cart, and to have placed one on each Stone, and yet to have gone away mistaken in his Arithmetick. This Tradition, as most fabulous and best suiting our Purpose, we have hinted at in this Entertainment; and I observe, that in an old Play, called The Birth of MERLIN, or, The Child hath found his Father, (said to have been written by Shakespeare and Rowley) this superstitious Opinion finds Countenance. Merl. ? And when She dyes, I will erect a Monument Upon the verdant Plains of Salisbury, No King shall have so high a Sepulchre, With pendulous Stones that I will hang by Art, Where neither Lime, nor Mortar shall be us'd; (A dark Ænigma to thy Memory!) For None shall have the Pow'r to number them: A Place, that I will hallow for your Rest. For no Night-hag shall walk, nor Ware-Wolf tread, Where Merlin's Mother shall be sepulchred. Nor was Stone-henge the only Place in which Historians have invested Merlin with a Property; but they tell us, that he had a Castle in Wiltshire, called, after his Name, Merlin's Bury, now Marlborough. Again, as he was born at Caermardin, (now Carmarthen) Some will therefore have that Town to have been formerly call'd Caer-Merlin. And in so high Request did his Character, as a Prophet, stand in Wales, that when King Henry IId pass'd a Ford near Newport in Monmouthshire, the Welsh were presently discourag'd, and look'd upon their Case desperate, because their Oracle Merlin had foretold, That whenever a strong Prince with a freckled Face (such King Henry was;) should pass that Ford, the British Forces should be vanquished. Nor was his Reputation, as a Magician and Prophet, confined to the Writers of our own Country. The learned Alanus of Lisle wrote a large Commentary on his Prophesies. Ariosto, the Italian Poet, describes his Tomb; and makes his Spirit from within it utter Prophesies to a Lady. And the ingenious Spaniard Cervantes, when his Don Quixote descends into Montesino's Cave, makes him tell of several Knights and Lovers inchanted there by Merlin; who, says he, was reputed to be the Devil's Son, or rather, one who knew more than the Devil himself. Thus much I have thought fit to glean on Both these Subjects; and as a Number of Authors have treated of them, I have chose to give the Readers my Collections on Credit, rather than every where to make a Parade by quoting hard Names, only to shew an Ostentation of Reading.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, A Desart Heath: A Prospect of Stone-henge. Harlequin, his Servant, and Company, dancing. After Thunder and Lightning, the Ghost of Faustus rises, and addresses to Harlequin. Ghost. Lo! the Companions of thy Crimes Fly from the Thunder's rattling Voice, That Vapour of a Cloud.— [Here Merlin appears amidst the Rocks. And can'st thou, deaf to all the Cries Of wounded Virtue in thy Breast, That awful Dread which Conscience wakes, Still riot in those guilty Arts, By which thy Sire, poor Faustus, fell? Merl. Rebellious Slave!— Ghost. For this my Shade the Center breaks, Reluctant urg'd to upper Air. O, too presumptuous Youth! The kindling Bolts of Vengeance fear, And stem thy Fate, remembring mine. Merl. False Spirit!—For this, be sure, Thou shalt be fetter'd fast in Fire. Ghost. Know'st thou not, 'midst those pendant Rocks, (This Pile of never-number'd Stone, So Lucifer ordain'd:) Curst Merlin's mortal Mother lies, To Fiends of old in horrid Wedlock join'd, And Fiends still revel round her Grave? Merl. Accurst Discov'rer! Hell's Empire is concern'd;— Ghost. O Faustulus, the Place avoid, Inspiring kindred Guilt: Perdition—Tortures—else o'ertake thee: Heaven's Anger never dies.— Merl. Ye Demons, that await my Pow'r, Sink him to lowest Hell. Ghost. On Cherubs' Wings Repentance sits To waft thy Soul to Bliss. I can no more:—an unseen Force To Vales of Horror drags me down. [Ghost sinks. Merl. There howl in Anguish!—Dost thou fly? [Harlequin and Servant run away. Poor cheated Mortal! far as Sea And Earth extend, extends my Sway. Fly to the utmost Verge; yet there I'll wind thee in my fatal Snare. [Thunder and Lightning: Merlin retires amidst the Rocks, and Scene closes. SCENE changes to a Street. Harlequin and Servant cross, as to a Tavern. SCENE, A Chamber. Harlequin, and Servant. Singing heard, without. Servant introduces a Gentleman, who addresses the Company. This Gloom, this Form of Discontent, Says, I intrude; and to your Board Proclaims me an unwelcome Guest. [Harlequin invites him to sit down. Then let one Face of Mirth, around, And Friendship, crown the Feast. Fill each Bowl with flowing Measure, 'Till it sparkle o'er the Brim; The Grave of Care, and Spring of Pleasure, Is when the Brains in Nectar swim. Fill your Veins with gen'rous Wine; That and Woman alone refine, And raise Mortals to Divine. Crown with Beauty all our Glasses, Beauty best our Pleasures guides: Give us but Wine, and blooming Lasses, Take back, ye Gods, all your Gifts besides. Be gay; and, to thy latest Breath, Know Me thy Friend:—This strict Embrace Makes Us for ever One.— [Merlin, being discover'd. 'Tis I:—but wherefore this Affright? Howe'er fond Zealots paint me forth A Demon to be shun'd, Survey the Pleasures of my Reign, And undeceive thy Fears. [Merlin changes the Scene to a pleasant Prospect of the Infernal Regions: Two Female Spirits advance and address Harlequin. 1 Spir. Hither turn thee, gentle Swain, Here unceasing Pleasures reign. Here the ravish'd Lovers languish With Delights, unmix'd with Anguish; Beauty, like eternal Spring, Here still blooming, Unconsuming, Without Measure, Yields its Treasure, Paying back each Joy you bring. Hither turn thee, gentle Swain; Here unceasing Pleasures reign. DANCE. 2 Spirit. The Nymphs of these Plains, all courteous and free, In Passion still equal the Lover's Degree; No nice Affectation, no surly Disdain, No studied Perverseness their Pleasures restrain; No Prudes here the Flame, which they burn with, conceal; No Coquets here profess the Flame, they ne'er feel. Where Fondness is artless, without a Disguise, And the Thoughts of the Heart are display'd in the Eyes; Where Nature in each naked Charm is express'd, There Love keeps his Throne, and the Lover is bless'd. DANCE. Merl. to Harl. 'Tis thus my faithful Subjects live; Has mortal Life Delights like These? Yet if thy Soul aspire t'abide Longer on Earth, return;— O'er Hearts alone I covet Rule. Make Converts of thy cheated Friends; Display my Empire to their Minds, And shew 'em to be wise and blest. [Exeunt Omnes. SCENE Changes to a Street. Comic. SCENE, a Market. After Harlequin has chang'd himself into a Mountebank-Doctor, his Zany sings this Ballad. Zany. Kind Gentles, come listen: Behold, on this Stage, The only infallible Doctor o'th'Age: He dispenses the Pill, beyond That of Pall-Mall, For it will make you sick, if it won't make you well. So rare the Effects, that its Pow'r, not confin'd To the Cures of the Body, works as well on the Mind; One Dose, rightly taken, (for That must appear;) Will make Misers lavish, and Tricksters sincere. Cure Coquets of the Hip, after Loss of Complexion; Cure Prudes of leud Scandal,—that spreading Infection! Nay, more;—tho' nice Virgins six Children have bore This Pill makes 'em virtuous,—as even before. A Young Girl, amongst the Croud, consulting the Mountebank, is snatch'd away by his Stage closing up. SCENE, a Chamber. An Italian, and his Wife. After some Comic, the Country Girl from the Market is introduc'd, and sings the following Ballad to the Italian. When a Virgin once gets the Love-toy in her head, How many odd Whims from one Notion are bred! If a Beau do but give her a Glance at the Play, If he's near enough one civil Rapture to say, She presently thinks, there's a Passion on foot; And eagerly longs to come to't. Then her Nights grow unquiet, fantastick her Schemes; (For Fancy presides both o'er Actions and Dreams;) The Amusements, that once had their Charm, now displease; The Lap-Dog,—the Monkey,—the Chambermaid,—teize: So deeply within the sweet Passion takes root, She eagerly longs to come to't. Yet no sooner the Swain shall begin his Address, But, as if chang'd by Magick, she fancies him less: The Creature grows shocking! and Love is a Guest, Shall ne'er take possession to ruffle her Breast! Who would think, from a Nymph so averse to the Fruit, She eagerly long'd to come to't? But the Lover, if artful to follow his Game, Will extinguish the Prude, and rekindle the Flame; To a Volley of Kisses her Bosom will rise, A Whisper, a Languish, will wake am'rous Sighs: Then again, if the Swain do but make his Pursuit, She'll eagerly long to come to't.
