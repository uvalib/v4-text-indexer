      <field name="fulltext">The stage represents the vestibule of a palace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. CLYTEMNESTRA. âAnd Agamemnon will be here to-day! Triumphant and adorn'd with trojan spoil.â After ten years of danger, to survive! What will become of me? O fatal hour, In which I yielded to my slave, Egysthus: Had I but held him still in his degree, Nor with such blazon of my favour, shown A doting heart to all the crowd of Argos.â Some courtly sycophant, that woos promotion, Will blab against us. O deluded victim, So in the fume and riot of my passion, To dare destruction. We cannot escape! SCENE II. Clytemnestra and Arsinoe. CLYTEMNESTRA. The king returns to-day. ARSINOE. So I have heard. CLYTEMNESTRA. Why are you sad, Arsinoe? The news Should meet, from you, a blithe and cheerful welcome. ARSINOE. But, what a welcome shall the king receive? What honest hail will cheer his coming home? Who will rejoice, when he recounts the war? Who will not weep, when he describes his wounds, And sigh with sorrow, that they were not mortal. CLYTEMNESTRA. Nurse, you grow bold. ARSINOE. Oh! well-a-day, that I Have liv'd to see the royal babe I cherish'd, When grown to manhood, and a hero fam'd, Supplanted in his love, by a vile slave;â A coarse, rank-smelling groom; a neighing groom; But fit companion for the horse he tended. CLYTEMNESTRA. Forget you, woman, that I am the queen? ARSINOE. Oh! that the queen had ne'er forgot herself: And where, Oh where is Agamemnon's child? When he departed for the trojan warâ Alack, my heart, that was a day in Argos: The shore all dazzling with the grecian arms, And every echo of the mountains, shouting The acclamations of the warriors' cheer:â He left you budding, large with royalty; Where is the fruit? CLYTEMNESTRA. Arsinoe; you know, That on the very night my child was born, A menial traitor stole it from my side. ARSINOE. Had you not prov'd yourself more treas'nous prone, By shameless tokens to your pamper'd slave, That loyal theft had never been committed. How could you think that there were none at court To grudge his rising,ânot one heart to feel More for the monarch than his horse's servant? Who did not fear from your infatuation, The sacrifice of our true lawful prince? CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! I am ruin'd, ruin'd, past all hope. SCENE III. ARSINOE. Alack, alack, where is that joyful stir, That should await the victor from the field? Where is the preparation for the feast, The high adornments for the royal banquet? Where are the musicants to swell the anthem, And sound a flourish as the hero comes? Here, silent, sullen Apprehension reigns; And, for the wine that should flow at the board, Blood shall be shed, and wailing rise for songs. SCENE IV. Arsinoe and Egysthus. ARSINOE. Audacious varlet, hast thou not yet fled? What incantation can the eagle charm, That the usurper of his royal nest, Shall not be torn and scatter'd to the winds? Hast thou not heard the rushing of his wings, And yet not slunk away? EGYSTHUS. Forbear, forbear, And tell me what to do. ARSINOE. Go slay thyselfâ Die with one death, for hundreds now await thee. On every joint of thee, shall torture gnash; And o'er thy quiv'ring remnants, shall the flames Hiss as they feed. EGYSTHUS. Arsinoe, in mercyâ ARSINOE. Thou grub, that dar'dst to crawl on royalty; Better, far better had it been for thee, To have been smother'd in the stable slough, When thou, beneath a canopy of state, Profan'd'st the breast where Agamemnon lay. EGYSTHUS. Was I to blame? By bribe and leer allur'd; It was not I that dar'd,âI was besought. ARSINOE. Try what that plea will now avail thee, slave! EGYSTHUS. Would you had warn'd me but of this before. ARSINOE. Think'st thou, I wish'd to gain the prophet's fate, And for my boding, lie without my head. But, now I speak. Thy hoofs are off me now. And I am up again, and in my tower. But, where is all thy rampant insolence, Those high curvets, that so amaz'd the crowd? Back, from the portal back, and give me passage. SCENE V. EGYSTHUS. This proud old fury will undo us all.â To fly, is now too late, for all the gates And all the walls, are with spectators throng'd; Waiting the king and trophies from the war.â SCENE VI. Egysthus and Clytemnestra. EGYSTHUS. Ha! come you here. Keep more aloof from me. We stand upon the very edge of life. Arsinoe has gone beside herself, And threatens to betray. CLYTEMNESTRA. Cannot we fly? EGYSTHUS. Impossible! The town is all a-foot; The roads are full, and every eye is wide. CLYTEMNESTRA. Would that Arsinoe could be prevail'd. EGYSTHUS. You always were too bold and confident; I ever warn'd you to be circumspect. CLYTEMNESTRA. Had you been but content with private gain, We had not fallen to this jeopardy. But you still would have gaudy exhibition, And ape the courtiers. EGYSTHUS. The fault was your's. Why shower upon me, wealth, if not for use? If we escape to night; before the dawn, I'll off to sea, and never come again. CLYTEMNESTRA. Can you, Egysthus, break from me so freely. EGYSTHUS. Your husband is at hand. CLYTEMNESTRA. But, you, my lov'dâ EGYSTHUS. Gods! cease this fondling. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah! you love me not. EGYSTHUS. Better for me, had been your hate than love. See what avails your gifts and your caresses. My strawy pallet, yielded sweeter rest Than your high couch, o'er-canopied with gold. SCENE VII. Arsinoe, Egysthus, and Clytemnestra. ARSINOE. Oh! wretched queen, regardless of thy doom. E'en while the slaying hand is stretch'd to catch, Thus, like a silly hen, safe in the sun, To nestle fondly on a loathsome dung-hill. If thou wilt welcome home thy lord with blood, Go, wanton openly to all the court? Why, with a half-seen leer or dubious smile, Beget suspicion, since you seek detection? Since you so dote upon your fated minion; Go kiss him openly on the high-way; Hang on his neck before the shouting rabble, That all may know the lush of your lewd love, And save grave justice from the amorous proving. Ay, get thee gone, and curse thy brawny vigour, That Death, so little will account to-night. SCENE VIII. Clytemnestra and Arsinoe. CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! my Arsinoe, what shall be done? If flight could save, it is not in our power, Nor will one suffer; all the three must die. You were the confident, the minister; Nor I alone, no: nor Egysthus only, Will pacify the dreadful Agamemnon. You, even you, that cherish'd him a babe; And, by that claim, may think, perchance, to'scape, Must bleed, unpitied, to appease his vengeance. ARSINOE. I was constrain'd; against my heart, I serv'd. Thick fell my tears, and painful were my sighs, On that dire night, when to your chamber, first, I brought the overbold, o'er-weening groom. CLYTEMNESTRA. And think you then, by sacrificing us, To save yourself? ARSINOE. Had you been wary wise, Frugal in gifts, and ruled in your desires; We had not come to this extremtiy! But, all the nobles of the land beheld, Your mighty love, descending in the gold. CLYTEMNESTRA. Yet, no one spoke, to me, as if they knew. ARSINOE. No! wherefore should they? You had other gifts. What was the guilt to them, if you bestow'd The boons that their obsequiousness implor'd? CLYTEMNESTRA. Why should the danger then, be greater now? ARSINOE. Why should it? CLYTEMNESTRA. Ay. ARSINOE. Because, with you, no more Rest the rich motives of the courtiers faith. CLYTEMNESTRA. Yet, who, Arsinoe, but you alone, Can tell, that more between me and Egysthus Has ever pass'd, than may unslander'd pass, Between a mistress and a worthy servant. You shake your head. Well, grant I have been lavish: It shows that avarice is not my foible. ARSINOE. Such boundless favour as you show'd to him, And rapid transmutation from a slave, To wealth that over-tower'd our proudest antients, Are flagrant evidence that it was passion. CLYTEMNESTRA. What shall be done? ere many minutes fly, The triumph will arrive.âWhat shall we do? ARSINOE. Save, if you can, yourself; as I will try. SCENE IX. CLYTEMNESTRA. Cunning, perfidious hag! thy insolence Full truly proves, that I have stood on ice; A slippery stead, deceitful and unsound! But, why not her, as well as either, suffer? She scruples not, to save herself by us! Should we then pause to save ourselves by her? But, how? There is not time; and were she hush'd, Some other parasyte of patronage, Will serve again th'ingredients for our death. Ha! is there here a demon, prompting me? If we could kill the king.âTremendous thought. My soul is curdled with the bare conceit! But, if he live, I shall be slain myself: And, how may this aspiring deed be done? Or, by Arsinoe? Or, by Egysthus? By posset, or by poiniard? Her, no more, Dare I confide in: and, if he should turn, And give me up, to buy his own escapeâ SCENE X. Clytemnestra and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. How far is, yet, the army from the town? EGYSTHUS. By the last messengers, the van had come On this side Mycenea. CLYTEMNESTRA. Well, Egysthus; What think you now? EGYSTHUS. I only think of death. CLYTEMNESTRA. Whose death? EGYSTHUS. Whose death? CLYTEMNESTRA. Ay, whose? EGYSTHUS. My own and yours. The witch, Arsinoe, will destroy us all. Oh! had she died a month ago. CLYTEMNESTRA. You thinkâ EGYSTHUS. What? CLYTEMNESTRA. If she had died a month ago?â EGYSTHUS. Well? CLYTEMNESTRA. You think then, that to-day is now too late? EGYSTHUS. What do you mean by these mysterious looks? There's no one near us. Well? CLYTEMNESTRA. Alas! Egysthus; We stand in imminent and deadly hazard. EGYSTHUS. I rue that e'er I fell within your sight. CLYTEMNESTRA. The past is gone: not Jove himself, can roll The stream of time again towards the source. Let us look round; perchance, in this dread whirl, Some eddy may arise to bear us out. EGYSTHUS. Said you not, if Arsinoe were dead?â CLYTEMNESTRA. You are well built, and should be bold, Egysthus, Had you but that courageous enterprize, So needful to the lover of a queen, We should not quake in such alarm'd amaze. SCENE XI. EGYSTHUS. What would the gagging of the saucy dame Avail us now? Would not the death of her, Save Clytemnestra; who, by it, might charge Me with the murder, and so save herself. Many there are among the palace swarm, Who think, Arsinoe has been my dame. I know the queen is crafty; though so fond, That e'en to punishment, she clings upon me. Yet may her sinister and subtile nature, Egg her to this.âFor me, there's no escape. None, none! Had the king perish'd in the wars; Or, by some sudden stroke, were yet arrested.â The daring notion bursts like flame upon me. And lights my fancy with magnificence. But hark! the victor. Let his cymbals clash. They ring in prelude to my swelling theme. SCENE XII. Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Egysthus, and Arsinoe. AGAMEMNON. The captives now may, to the inner halls, Bear their refulgent burdens, and the troops Have quick dismissal. Let all hearts, to-day, Exult in Argos; and, to those that mourn For sons and husbands with the fallen brave, Th'immortal tenants of the trojan plain, Give double largess. Clytemnestra, here! CLYTEMNESTRA. Hail to my lord! all hail be to my hero. O happy day; my second wedding day, That gives, once more, to these long widow'd arms, My Agamemnon, glorious and renown'd. AGAMEMNON. My Clytemnestra, still in all her charms! I thought, ten years of anxious care, had blighted The rosy of thy bloom; but thou art still, Yea, rather, sweet, in fuller blow of beauty, Than when we parted. ARSINOE. O my royal liege! AGAMEMNON. Arsinoe too! How hast thou fared, good nurse? EGYSTHUS. (I hang upon the point of agony.) ARSINOE. See this, Egysthus. EGYSTHUS. Heav'ns! CLYTEMNESTRA. Ay, true, my lord. But sure, Arsinoe, we had time enough. This gallant youth has claims upon your favour: We'll take another time to speak of it. Kneel down, Egysthus, to your royal master. Now, my dear lord, we'll to the hall together; Where you shall tell me all the tale of Troy. Come, come Arsinoe, take Egysthus's arm, And follow us. I'll serve you all I can.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. ARSINOE. It is not sorc'ry that deceives my sight? Or has my brain been drench'd with th'insane wine, And I but fancy what I see and know? Am I awake? Is this the vestibule? Are these true echoes that resound my stamp? Gods! I will charge her on the very throne, Where she sits dallying at the king's right hand,â To make me in the focus of the court, Before the king and all the smiling nobles, E'en to the saucy leering guards a show. Some were that thought Egysthus dealt with me, Now she has prov'd it, who shall dare gainsay? But I will cry her wantonness to all; I will amaze the hearing with her passion. SCENE II. Arsinoe and Egysthus. ARSINOE. How now detested! But thou art secureâ It was with me, with me, Arsinoe, That thy nocturnal ravishments were spent, I brought thee, slave, from curry-combing mares To blandish majesty! I gave thee scents To quell the odious odours of thy trade; I shower'd the royal treasures on thy back; I gave thee gems; e'en I, Arsinoe! EGYSTHUS. All true, good nurse; but cease this furious clamour. ARSINOE. All true! and dar'st thou smile and call it true? Has Agamemnon come, and dar'st thou smile? Thou that not many minutes since I saw As lurch'd and cringing as a fact-found thief, And wilt thou brag thyself my paramour? EGYSTHUS. If need will have it so. Look at this ring; It is a jewel known to all the court; You had it from the queen, and wore it often, A glittering eye attracting star to all: See where it shines enspher'd upon my finger. ARSINOE. I know, I know it well. Thy artful litter Gave it to me; urg'd me to put it on. And when I had some dozen times or so Worn it abroad, she took it back again, And now I see it on thy finger raying As deadly as the eye of basilisk. I cannot deal with such a sorceress. EGYSTHUS. Shall we be friends again? Or will you still Rave in defiance of such proof as this? ARSINOE. If I would screen, some other will betray, And I shall suffer without serving you. Wilt thou depart from Argos? EGYSTHUS. Without you! ARSINOE. What would my going hence avail to thee? EGYSTHUS. When I am gone you will accuse the queen. ARSINOE. And wilt thou stay? How! hop'st thou yet to share Her lavish warmth, and Agamemnon here? EGYSTHUS. Were you but wise, all things might yet go well, And turn of rich account, to you and me. Come, let the courtiers take their laugh at us. ARSINOE. Avaunt from me. I thought thee in my power, But thy familiar has unbound the cords, And wrapp'd them round myself. What shall I do! SCENE III. EGYSTHUS. Now would this harpy, for her own success, Crush me as if I were indeed a worm. So climb they all at court, and why not I. Ambition builds from ruins; and the fate That gave me luring for a royal eye, Inspires the gorgeous hope that draws me on To lofty purposes. If the fond queen Change not her fare and seek variety.â SCENE IV. Clytemnestra and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. Still rapt Egysthus, are you still afraid, Want you the courage man to help me out? Take heart and play the lover freely now; I'll ask the king himself to give her dower, And she shall marry you. Come be of heart, Wed, wed her, man, and be a widower. EGYSTHUS. Is there no other way? Though she were dumb As spade and turf can make her, some one else Will spy and blab.âThis night I'll leave the town. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ungrateful man that can so easy part!â See'st thou not fortune stretching forth her hand To pull thee to the golden eminence, And yet wilt not take hold. O there are men, Who, for the moiety of half thy chance, Would dare the threats of fiery chimeras, And through the volley of a thousand flames Rush but to gain the height on which you stand. EGYSTHUS. But what is all while Agamemnon lives?â CLYTEMNESTRA. Is he immortal, inaccessible? Invulnerable to the pointed steel? Feels he no hunger, does he never thirst?â Had I the motive friend that you might have, I'd play the drudging scullion's part myself, And spice his supper! EGYSTHUS. But Arsinoeâ CLYTEMNESTRA. Be it your study still to mar her entrance.â Great gods! the king approaches! play to me The begging sycophant, and haste away. SCENE V. Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. CLYTEMNESTRA. O silly lout to ask so strange a thing; There is full more than forty year of odds. He must expect her surely soon to die. AGAMEMNON. Is that the youth for whom you claim'd my favour? CLYTEMNESTRA. The very same. Guess you what he has pray'd for; But I forgetâyou know not who he is. In sooth to say, 'tis a side-shaking tale. The nurse, though old, is still, my lord, a woman; And young Egysthus is a portly youth. He has intreated me for your consent, That he may wed Arsinoe. AGAMEMNON. What! he! CLYTEMNESTRA. Riches weigh well my lord against old age. AGAMEMNON. She must be craz'd and fallen far in dotage. CLYTEMNESTRA. You speak great truth. She is beside herself; More than a month she has been chiding me, To give my sanction; vainly have I spoken, Yea pray'd her, oft, to quit her lewd intent, At least, till your return. I should have else Blush'd to have had the wedding in my house. She is the laughing-stock of all the town. When the glad tidings came that Troy had fall'n, Gifts were distributed; and she received The fairest ring you sent of all the spoil. Some few short times she sparkled it about; To-day I see it on Egysthus's fingerâ That is not all. The old enchanted dame Must have a rival, and be jealous too. AGAMEMNON. Alas! poor nurse! Who may her rival be? CLYTEMNESTRA. Can you not guess? Come try? AGAMEMNON. Indeed I cannot. Ten years of busy and eventful strife, Have worn away the frill of courtiership. CLYTEMNESTRA. Nay try to guess, and grow gallant again; You must this martial sternness cast aside. I will prohibit you the use of steel. Gods! what have courtiers to do with swords?â Nay, you shall wear soft velvet for your vest; To-night you shall. What have you now to fear? The am'rous glances of our ladies' eyes Strike not so furiously as Hector's javelin. AGAMEMNON. But pray whose charms does fair Arsinoe fear? CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah true! will you not guess? AGAMEMNON. In truth I cannot. CLYTEMNESTRA. Who should it be, but she that still resists Her wanton craze. AGAMEMNON. What! you? CLYTEMNESTRA. Your selfsame queen! Nay do not laugh, for she has evidence. âWhy should the queen, if she were not in love,â Says sage Arsinoe, âoppose my bliss?ââ I could a hundred of her fancies tell you. She is the merry-thought of all the court. And when we have an empty hour to fill, I'll call her confidents to make you mirth. AGAMEMNON. But who is he? How is her lover called? CLYTEMNESTRA. Egysthus. AGAMEMNON. True; pray what is he? CLYTEMNESTRA. Nay that Is such a question I should ask myself. She brought him, to me, as her relative, And pray'd that I would notice him with favour. But there are slanderers about the palace, And I have heard, yet cannot credit it, That he is of some very vulgar stock; Nay, that his father was a menial slave. Some viler envious still more assert, And say that he himself was once a groom: But this is wicked, and not credible. AGAMEMNON. I think so too. He has a gallant air. CLYTEMNESTRA. And is well spoken, and of pithy sentence. To say the truth, the young man has his merits. AGAMEMNON. I'll speak with him, and should I find him worthy, He shall have due promotion for his looks. But see Arsinoe comes. I'll joke with her. CLYTEMNESTRA. Not for the world my lord. Now go you in, Leave her to me, I must appease her fears; Nor is it modest for a man to speak Of such a love as hers. Do leave me heart! SCENE VI. Arsinoe and Clytemnestra. ARSINOE. And shall I never gain access to him? How like a smiling harlot she appears! O that a man so gen'rous and so great, Should be cajol'd by such a false as this. CLYTEMNESTRA. How now, Arsinoe! why so sullen still? All runs right smoothly, pray thee smooth thy brow; The king is cheery, and laughs at your loving. ARSINOE. My loving, mine! How can you still persist? The flattering lie will not avail you long. CLYTEMNESTRA. For your repute, things cannot now be worse. By harming me, you cannot help yourself. Though I were sacrificed, the world would say You had your share; and you were confident! Think well, Arsinoe, think well I say. When you have once the fatal secret told, No cunning then can charm it into rest. You might as well by weeds and simples try To place the yesterday behind to-morrow, As to recall the shaft that you would shoot. When it shall have departed from the bow, The victims then must suffer.âThink I say. How has the king been harm'd by what is done? What print can he of poor Egysthus trace? I seem as sweet and luscious to his eye, As the untasted apple in the hand, Would you persuade the pleas'd and cheerful child, To cast it down, by crying grubs and worms? Can he be hurt that knows not of his wound? Arsinoe you are wise. Think well I say. ARSINOE. But will Egysthus quickly quit the court? CLYTEMNESTRA. Will you consent to sanction what is done? ARSINOE. How! tell the king he was my paramour? CLYTEMNESTRA. No: but ask leave to marryânothing more. ARSINOE. And if the king consentâ CLYTEMNESTRA. What if he do? ARSINOE. Better to send Egysthus from the land; Think you not so? CLYTEMNESTRA. Yes, true; nurse you are right. Will you request the king for leave to wed: Then might I urge th'unfitness of the match, And with entreaty pray you to refrain, Bribing Egysthus to depart from Argos. ARSINOE. I yield, I cannot but submit to you. CLYTEMNESTRA. Dearest Arsinoe! counsellor, friend, By this decision I'm thy slave for ever. Ask what thou wilt. Have I no gem, nor gift That I may give thee, for this blessed mind; See where Egysthus comes! alack, poor swain! SCENE VII. Clytemnestra, Egysthus and Arsinoe. CLYTEMNESTRA. More reverence, youth, remember I am queen; Here beam your smiles, here on this op'ning rose, Bestow O sun! the ray of amorous light. Arsinoe has consented, will implore The king's permission to espouse her swain. EGYSTHUS. Thanks sweet Arsinoe, now am I blest. ARSINOE. Pray mock me not. To-morrow be you readyâ EGYSTHUS. So soon! ARSINOE. Rude insolent; to-morrow fly. Be you not seen in Argos by the sun: I may repent, and turn on you again. CLYTEMNESTRA. Come, come, no more; though lovers may fall out, This is no time for bickering, dear nurse. Egysthus, woo her with your sweetest breath, While I inform the king of her desire. SCENE VIII. Arsinoe and Egysthus. ARSINOE. Presume not thou, though need has made it soâ And I must wear a masque before the king, That I will light thee to her couch again. Thy nights of majesty are all departed; So hie thee hence to graze as thou wert wont, And with some blouzy mate of thy degree, Forget the dalliance of a royal bed. EGYSTHUS. Gentle, Arsinoe; ill words feed strife. Our fates are mingled, and we should be friends. If I am made of coarser stuff than kings, And to be such is fault; is the fault mine? If I was mother'd, like a whelp, in straw, Say good Arsinoe if the sin was mine? For well I wot, that to be lowly born, Makes half a traitor of a man at court. Pray what am I, that I should be so scorn'd; Mulct of the grace that nature gave my form, And spurn'd at as a draggled kennel cur. What are you all that wear these lofty looks, But blow flies, feeding on the state's sore back? Have I not learnt the secrets of your game, And known that with your stately stepping pride, Ye are gynecocratic puppets all? Taunt me no more, my haughty headed dame. What, if I turn on you, and on the queen! I stand in peril, but I know the worst; And will no longer wheedle nor petition. ARSINOE. Did I not see, or was it but a dream, You, you, Egysthus, cringing for my mercy? EGYSTHUS. But then, I thought not that your courtly craft Would crush the friendless, to escape yourself. My eyes are opened now to all your guile, And I can look at death, with eye as firm As he of Troy. But life is sweet to all; As sweet to him that on the stirrup tends, As to the monarch that bestrides the steed; And my sweet life I will not cheaply lose. ARSINOE. Art thou, Egysthus, that light-hearted lad, Who blush'd and linger'd, and was loath to come To share the love and splendour of a queen? EGYSTHUS. Thy masque, Arsinoe; the king is here! SCENE IX. Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Arsinoe, and Egysthus. ARSINOE. I had, my lord, a hearing to entreat: Much cause have I to fear your dreadful rage. I am, my lord, a very wretched wretch. Fain would I speak, but terror mars my words; I am not what I seem, nor what I was. AGAMEMNON. Thine is, dear nurse, a doleful case indeed. ARSINOE. This cruel woman! or what fitter nameâ AGAMEMNON. Kind, loving nurse, most cruel she has been. ARSINOE. Oh! my dear lord, if I had strength of grasp, I would, this instant, give her doom myself. CLYTEMNESTRA. I told you true, she is beside herself. Speak you, Egysthus, spare your true love's blushes. Come, come with me, Arsinoe, and be calm. I'll lead her hence, my lord, and calm her fears. Come, come, I say; you shall have our consent While I am with you and Egysthus here: Be not afraid.âRestrain your jealousy; Come, come, Arsinoe; come, trait'ress, come. SCENE X. Agamemnon and Egysthus. AGAMEMNON. Poor dame! Egysthus! one so young as you Must sicken at this silly woman's dote; Far better, man, to raise some other game: Quit this mean scent and try the soldier's chace. EGYSTHUS. But I am poor and she has been my friend,â Rais'd me, as I may say, quite from the earth, And given me companionship with nobles. AGAMEMNON. Now this is good. I like this gratitude. Perhaps, you hope she may die, quickly, off. That honest smiling, pleases me, young man. Think no more of this wrinkled carlin's passion; I'll be thy friend, and give thy fortune help. EGYSTHUS. My royal lord, would I were worthy this. AGAMEMNON. Rise from thy kneeling. Wherefore are these tears? Count me thy friend, and early claim my favour. SCENE XI. EGYSTHUS. Unhappy wretch; slave of remorseless fortune. Thus on the threshold of my fell intent, To meet this hospitable hearted friendship, In him, in him, that I have so abused; In him, alas! that I have doom'd to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Clytemnestra and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. Goodâgood, all true; but then our danger think. There is no choice, or he, or we must die. EGYSTHUS. I have already done enough of wrong. Let this day pass; but by the morrow's dawn I'll quit the shore, and bid farewell to Argos. He has, unsought, shown me much gracious favour, And but for the sour surfeit of the past, I might have feasted with a cheerful heart. Now am I like a sick man placed before Rare treats and dainties that allure to taste, For having foully fared; 'tis loathsome all. CLYTEMNESTRA. Egysthus, this is delicacy feign'd. What is the favour that has wrought this change? Has it not flow'd from my ill-answer'd love? If you are thriving in the royal beam, Who brought you from the chill ungenial shade? Kings, like the sun, move in a distant sphere, And those that prosper in their influence, Must have the agency of meaner beings. When the sun stoops from his meridian throne, And turns the bending lilly to his eye, Then will bright orbed royalty confer Spontaneous fost'ring on a humble hind. If you have this new debt of heart to pay, I am the creditor; the claim is mine. EGYSTHUS. But are we not endanger'd deep enough? This enterprize will but enthrall us more. CLYTEMNESTRA. If you have nerve of heart and strength of hand, Virtue to think, and courage to perform, We should, to-night, be only less than Gods, Safe on the high olympian top of power. But you so flinch and look for sculking 'scapes.â Gods! I begin to rue that e'er I took So mean a losel for my love and champion. EGYSTHUS. But when the stroke is struck, the courtiers then May rush on me, and vindicate the blow. CLYTEMNESTRA. Fear not the sycophants, but do it well. When it is done, they'll kneel and crouch to thee, Like spaniel puppies that have done amiss. I'll give command, that at the feast, to-night, None come in armour, nor with warlike weapon, As we have made the banquet for the peace.â Bring you a dagger ready in your bosom. EGYSTHUS. It would be safer far to drug his drink. CLYTEMNESTRA. That cannot be without a confident; And we have seen by curs'd Arsinoe, What 'tis to traffic with such ministers. EGYSTHUS. I would that I had other means to live. This task of blood is dreadful in the notion. But strong constraint environs me around, And I am clipt to the extremity. Things come upon me with such rush and haste, That wanting time, I want the power to think.â Let me take breath; hurry me not so fast. This speed of fate appals me. I'm as one That steer'd his pinnace gaily in a river, Feeling the force of some great cataract Drawing him down: alarm'd, he sees the stream That rippling murmur'd, changed to flowing glass, O'er whose smooth silence slides the roughest wind: Louder and louder nears the roaring fall.â I will into my chamber for a space. SCENE II. CLYTEMNESTRA. This new felt penitence I cannot credit.â Men that do injuries, regard their ill, Like harsh injustice done against themselves, And seek to vindicate, by doing more. He feigns reluctance, but his thoughts are firm; His questions still have been to prove the way, And once or twice, he slurr'd my constancy. To doubt of me, whose fondness has o'erleap'd, So far, the bound of all impediment.â He never met me with that earnest warmth Which my desiring bosom still required.â His love of pomp and lordly equipage, The fatal source of all our present fears, Shows an ambitious demon in his breast. What; if when I have placed him on the throne, He change like other minions to their fond, And strike aside the hand that raised him up; Then am I lost again. Oh! fated fool. SCENE III. Arsinoe and Clytemnestra. ARSINOE. Ha! in tears! What means this ominous shower? Has then some other got the start of me? How! does the king suspect? CLYTEMNESTRA. Arsinoe here! ARSINOE. Wipe as you will, I saw them falling fast. CLYTEMNESTRA. You have, Arsinoe, made me very wretched. Better, far better had you brought a dragon, Or deadly python, when you brought Egysthus. ARSINOE. Now, now, my words of wisdom come to pass. But what has chanc'd so in a little hour? CLYTEMNESTRA. I cannot live, if he abandon me. I struggled long to root his image out; But deeper, still and deeper, it is fix'd. ARSINOE. And will you not consent to send him hence? Well, drink to drunkenness; fill up the cup; Forth to the street, and rant it out to all. CLYTEMNESTRA. The adder's bite, and the envenom'd bowl, But pain us once, and soon we lie at rest; While faithless love and fell gratitude, Strike, every day, a new and sharper sting. SCENE IV. ARSINOE. This sorrow was not meant for vulgar eyes: Sudden and unexpected it has come. Whence has it arisen? What can be the cause? Egysthus?âHis ingratitude?âHow that? He ever has been pliant to her pleasure, And when he goes, it is for her he goes. Why should she then dread his ingratitude, Or faithless love? I understand it not. Can they have quarrel'd?âHow! for what, or when? But here he comes, and I will study him. SCENE V. Egysthus and Arsinoe. EGYSTHUS. Where is the queen? I thought she had been here. ARSINOE. She was, but has retir'd. She seem'd distrest. EGYSTHUS. Said she not when she would again return? ARSINOE. You then expected to have met her here? Her mind, indeed, seem'd sore and ill at ease. You have, Egysthus, ill requited her. For me, whom Agamemnon has so oft, While yet a tender infant, milk'd and nuzzled, With greedy playfulness upon my breast, 'Twas fit that I should roughly treat her lapse. But you, who have her love and bosom shared, To slight her so, is base ingratitude. EGYSTHUS. Has she again had confidence in you? ARSINOE. Confidence! how! What greater confidence Could she entrust, than her own life and yours? EGYSTHUS. But did she tell you when she would return? ARSINOE. O you have something then to say to her? EGYSTHUS. You are inquisitive, Arsinoe. ARSINOE. Not I, Egysthus; but you look perplext. EGYSTHUS. To-morrow, nurse, I have resolv'd to go. ARSINOE. That we had settled. Have you alter'd since? What dream of safety can entice your stay? EGYSTHUS. The king has shown me kindness.âHave you heard? He is a noble and a gracious master; My heart is yearning to become his slave. Would that I could, be any slave but this.â SCENE VI. ARSINOE. There's more in him than going hence to-morrow. Why feels he such compunction for the king? What's this new confidence of which he spoke? She cannot live, if he abandon her: Then is he dearer to her than her life; And dearer much than Agamemnon's life.â And still he says, he will depart to-morrow. Has she proposed to him, then, to remain? Has she devised the murder of the king? Horrible thought! O guilt, where is thy limit? Since they have shut me from their councils now, I'll play the spy; I'll be the ruler still. I'll teach her yet, that she is in my power. SCENE VII. Clytemnestra and Arsinoe. CLYTEMNESTRA. Still here, Arsinoe; but why so thoughtful? ARSINOE. Me-thinks your cloud has been of short duration. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Twas but the drizzle of a passing vapour; And in my clear and summer mind again, The halcyon fancy spreads her gilded wing. ARSINOE. If you, with such a peril over you, With such a deep and dreadful pit below, And with an asp secreted in your bosom, Can share the sun-shine of contented thought, Let virtue perish, and all speed to vice. CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou speakest moral, good Arsinoe; In sooth a preacher, proselytical.â Was not Egysthus here? ARSINOE. Seek you him still? The man has some contrition but in you.â He has decided, and departs to-morrow. CLYTEMNESTRA. He spoke with you of his departure then? ARSINOE. He did: but he seem'd moody and distrest. He sighs with strange compassion for the king? What's in his fear? (This pinches to the quick.) CLYTEMNESTRA. (Can she suspect? Can he have laps'd in ought? Then are we lost. I'll prove her to the point.) Shall I not see him yet before he goes? ARSINOE. He did expect you, and you come for him. Have you not had a pact to meet again? CLYTEMNESTRA. We had, Arsinoe; but if he goâ ARSINOE. Did you entreat him to remain with you? CLYTEMNESTRA. What could I else? If he depart, I die. ARSINOE. Remain at court, and leave the king alive? CLYTEMNESTRA. Alas! unhappy me. ('Tis as I thought!) The king himself persuades him to remain, And also bids him think no more of you. Why should he go? sure now there is no need. Go find Egysthus; send him here to me, I'd something further speak with him of this. ARSINOE. (Though I could pawn my hand, there is a plot, This thrice-shrewd traitor, still so dextrous shifts The very lipping of the thing I seek, Into some reason, fair and natural, That makes me doubtful, even while convinced.) SCENE VIII. CLYTEMNESTRA. Her stifled triumph and malignant glance, Are proofs of her suspicion and deceit. We must be speedy, or we are undone. She said Egysthus spoke still of his going.â But here he comes. SCENE IX. Clytemnestra and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. You tarry long Egysthus. EGYSTHUS. Saw you Arsinoe? CLYTEMNESTRA. Have you resolv'd? EGYSTHUS. Have you confided in her? CLYTEMNESTRA. No: not I! Did you not speak to her; for she suspects? EGYSTHUS. I thought that you, perchance, had something said. She will betray usâwe shall be undone. CLYTEMNESTRA. Have you resolv'd? EGYSTHUS. I have no choice of will; We are constrain'd, and more if she suspects. CLYTEMNESTRA. Come, pluck up heart; throw off this gloomy look; Wear a smooth brow and cheat the world's eye. EGYSTHUS. But how, or when, shall we decide the deed? CLYTEMNESTRA. Did I not tell you at the banquet? EGYSTHUS. No! CLYTEMNESTRA. Then do it there. The hour is hast'ning on. EGYSTHUS. But there; I may not then approach the king; He will be high in state, and far apart. CLYTEMNESTRA. Be you at hand, as we approach the entrance, And when you see me take him by the arm, And lift my robe, then strike; I will so wrap Th'entangling drap'ry, as I link his arm, That he shall not have chance to draw his sword. SCENE X. Egysthus, Clytemnestra, and Arsinoe. EGYSTHUS. Will Agamemnon then retain his sword? CLYTEMNESTRA. He, as the king, cannot do else, I fear. EGYSTHUS. Gave you command that none should come with swords? CLYTEMNESTRA. I did.âAre you prepared? EGYSTHUS. I am. Arsinoe. (A dagger!) CLYTEMNESTRA. Now let us partâyou know the sign. EGYSTHUS. âThe robe. CLYTEMNESTRA. Be bold and resolute; we cannot fail. SCENE XI. Egysthus and Arsinoe. EGYSTHUS. This night I sleep in open regal state, Or in the deeper crimson of my blood. Chaos and hell! hast thou been here and heardâ Detested witch; but if I kill thee now, I shall precipitate myself to worse. Hither, curs'd lynx, and die when I have time. SCENE XII. Egysthus, Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. EGYSTHUS. She has escap'd, and to the garden fled; Had I pursued I should have been too late. CLYTEMNESTRA. Look where Egysthus stands; alas, poor swain! Where is Arsinoe? She is not here. AGAMEMNON. Why think you of her? She will come in time; Now let us in, for see the guests are placed. What now?â CLYTEMNESTRA. This flowing robe entangles me, Give me your arm, and let me take it up. SCENE XIII. Arsinoe, Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Egysthus. ARSINOE. Treason! murder! treason, my royal lord! AGAMEMNON. How now! release me. CLYTEMNESTRA. Strike, Egysthus, strike! EGYSTHUS. He has enough. ARSINOE. Alas! alas, too late! CLYTEMNESTRA. Stand back, ye daring and presumptuous crew, Release Egysthus, and revere your master. AGAMEMNON. Tell me, Arsinoe, tell me what is thisâ ARSINOE. Bloody adulteressâ CLYTEMNESTRA. Guards bear her hence. I am the queen, and as you tend my will, So shall ye have promotion and my favour. AGAMEMNON. O hell-born tygress, thus to welcome me! The savage fierce are faithful to their mates, But thou, perfidious, mak'st thy prey of thine. 'Tis done, 'tis done with me, I cannot rise. EGYSTHUS. I would have spar'd you, but to save myself. AGAMEMNON. Hence! traitor, slave, and know I am thy king. O thou chaste widow, that so mourn'd thy lord! CLYTEMNESTRA. Ay, play the man, the lord of the creation, And scorn the failing woman for her sin. 'Tis but the sovereign element of males, That nature honour'd with the sense of joy, And privilege to range. Our serving sex, Made for the use of free imperial man, Must shut themselves in frozen chastity, Like simple bulbs that winter in the soil, 'Till the ingerming season come again. O it was meet that I your plant, at home, Should spread my leaves and lift a flow'ry head, To heav'nly sun-shine and the nightly dew! Wives are not made of love's material. No: We are but vessels, casting-moulds for men.â While you lay glowing with your captive dames, Or sacking towns to furnish wanton beds, Thought you that nature slumber'd in my veins? But such, forsooth, was my voluptuous lapse, That only death or shameful degradation, Could expiate the sin.âLearn ere you die, That menial woman claims her half of love, And wives deserted can assert the claim.
