      <field name="fulltext">THE PLATONICK LOVERS. A TragÃ¦comedy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST NOBLE, Mr. Henry Iermyn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologve. 'Tis worth my smiles, to thinke what inforc'd waies And shifts, each Poet hath to helpe his Plaies. Ours now believe, the Title needs must cause From the indulgent Court, a kind applause, Since there hee learn't it first, and had command T'interpret what hee scarce doth understand. And then (forsooth) he saies, because 'tis now 'Twill take; and be admir'd too, by a few: But all these easie hopes, I'de like t'have marr'd, With witnessing his Title was so hard, 'Bove halfe our Citty audience would be lost, That knew not how to spell it on the Post. Nay, hee was told, some Criticks lately spent Their Learning to find out, it nothing meant: They will expect but little (hee replies) From that which nought or little signifies. Well, I (your Servant) who have labour'd heere In Buskins, and in Socks, this thirty years, I'th truth of my experience, could not chuse But say, these shifts would not secure his Muse: Then straight presented to his willing feare, How you are growne of late, harsh, and severe. (Excuse mee that I'm bold to peake my mind I'th darke, of what so publickly I find.) But this hath made him mourne: I've left him now With's limber Hat, o'reshadowing his brow, His Cloke cast thisâto hinder from his care, The scornes and censures hee may shortly heare: Such as shall teach, dispaire, lead him the way, Vnto a Grove of Cypresse, not of Bay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons of the Play. Theander, A young Duke, lately a Generall. Phylomont, A young Duke that borders by him. Sciolto, An old Lord, friend to Theander. Fredeline, Creature to Theander. Castraganio, Creature to Fredeline. Gridonell, A young Soldier, Sonne to Sciolto. Buonateste, A generous Artist. Arnoldo, Attendant on Theander. Iaspero, Attendant on Theander. Eurithea, Mr i s to Theander, sister to Phylomont. Ariola, Mr i s to Phylomont, sister to Theander. Amadine, Woman to Eurithea, sister to Castraganio.

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Sicilie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scen. 1. Enter Sciolto, Arnoldo, Iaspero, Attendants. Sciolto. What hoe? Arnoldo, Iaspero? Dispatch, Dispatch? You move like great fat Burghers that Had newly din'd, Criples would stirr more nimbly To a whipping? Are all things prepard? Arn. My Lord theres time enough, the Duke will not Be here till night. Sciol. From whence pray that Intelligence, From the Gazet, brought hither by a Muse from Paris sir? Arnol. Your Lordship receives yours (I thinke) in a little Letter ty'd to a Tartarian arrow. Iasp. Or 'bout the necke of a Barbary Pigeon, We know hee'le not be heere till night. Sciolt. You know? Your knowledge (sir) will scarse prefer A Clearke, to dine upon the care of a Tyth Pigg: death! my good serving-gentleman, Did not I leave him a league off, and with Him too, Duke Phylomont, their traine enough To famish our whole Sicilie, were not Nature bounteous to us in our good Corne? Arnol. Hath sprightly Phylomont Incounter'd with Our Duke Theander by the way too? Sciol. Light! Your businesse is to aske questions sir? A Court examiner? are all provisions made Of furniture and meat? Iasp. All, all my Lord. Sciolt. The inner roomes new hung, and th'garden Gallerie Adorn'd with Titians pictures, and those frames Of Tantaret, last brought from Rome? Arn. Yes Sir, and Tables spread with Napery finer than Poppeas smock, the Cuppords crack with studded Plate, And Christall violls thick enough, t'endure A fall, or hammer Sir. Iasp. Our Kitchins smoke so, That the fat steame blowne o're a towne besieg'd, Would cure the Famine in't? Arnol. The Sellers too so fill'd, that they would make A Danish army drunke. Sciolt. Arnoldo? Rogue? with good pure Muskaden Of Creet, I'm old, and must be nourish'd with My morning Sop, like Matrons that want teeth. Arnol. Your Lordship shall not faile to have it spic'd. Iasp. And when tis noone, your Mallamucko Mellon of An Amber scent, serv'd in a Grotto Sir, To coole you Lordships wishes, not your blood; For that wee guesse, hath not this many yeares Beene Feverish towards women. Sciolt. A merry knave. Goe good boyes both: call all the Waiters, and The Groomes, t'attend upon their severall charge, The Dukes will instantly arrive: our brave Theander sent mee for dispatch before, To take command of the whole house, looke to't; I shall be bounteous, but severe. Arn. My Lord we love your government, and will make haste. Exeunt Iaspero, Arnoldo. Enter Fredeline, Castraganio. Fred. Walke our horses nere the Parke gate untill A gen'rall care be giv'n for all the Troope. Within. I shall Sir. Fred. My Lord Sciolto, your good Horseman-ship Hath put us to some trouble to o'retake you: Let mee prefer this Gentleman unto Your knowledge, hee will deserve them both. Sciolt. I thanke you for him Signior Fredeline, No friendship of your choice can deserve lesse. How is he cal'd? Fred., Castraganio. 'Tis hee, whom with your kind consent I would prefer to our Dukes chamber: and the Brother to The witty Amadine, whom late I plac'd Chiefe woman to Eurithea, our grand Masters Mistris. Sciolt. Signior give me your hand, I love not Courtship, but I will promise To befriend you, and performe it too. Castra. Your Lordship hath just power o're my beliefe. Fred. He's lately posted from Uienna Sir, And can present you with a Letterâ Castr: gives Sciolto a letter. Sciolt. I hope, from the noble Colonell my Sons Governor. Castr. His name Sir is subscrib'd to it, And straight you will behold your Son, The scituation of this house, hath but a while Imploy'd his eyes without. Sciolt. Fredeline, the boy comes As I were Master o're my wish, 'tis now Full thirteene yeares (since first of tender growth) I sent him to the Campe, this Letter Sir, My better leisure shall survay. But pray, How is hee bred? My peevish humor gave A strange direction to his Governor, That he should never learne to Write, nor Reade, Nor never see a Woman. Castr. My Lord, you are obay'd in both: Hee is A good Souldier, and by his Learning will Sooner confute the Foe, than a Phylosopher, As for Women, th'are things he nere heard nam'd; Nor can the Campe present him any, but Course Suttlers Wives, creatures of so much durt, That shovell'd well together, they will serve To make a Trench ere they are dead, more fit To heave the stomack, than to stir the blood. Fred. I know 'um perfectly. They weare no smocks But cut out of an old cast Tent, and bind Their haire in horses Girths in stead of Phylliting. Sciolt. Such I dare allow him. Fred. Yet, with the freedome of your Lordships leave, These are but homely Principles to give For education of a Son and Heire! Not Write, nor Reade, nor see a Woman Sciolt. I will endure the hazard of a new Experiment, and try how Nature will Incline him; learning (I finde) doth make men Sawcy with their Maker, and false unto Themselues, and Women make us all fooles. Enter Gridonell. Castrag. Here comes your Sonne. Practise your reverence sir, there stands your Father. Grid. Well, which is he? stands still gazing about. Castra. There sit, with the gray beard. Grid. A comely old fellow, by this hand sir; I am glad to see you with all my heart! Sciolt. If you stand upon these points, sir and I you! Cast. Goe aske blessing. Grid. Does the old man look for't? Sciolt. Not I introth, for though the custome be Devout enough, it showes me thinkes too like a complement. Grid. You are in the right sir, and I hate complement as much as you. Fred. My Lord, his Governor hath follow'd your Directions to the shaddow of a haire, Hee's rarely bred to make a Favorite in the French Court. Sciolt. Goe pick you eares, good Signior, if you like It not, 'tis musicke unto mine; but sonne, How ere these manners are not much in use, You can be dutifull? Grid. Sir I am taught, My Father is my officer, I must Performe my duties, and obey him; besides, I love you more then a good Sword. Sciolt. Why, I thanke you Sir: there is no love lost. Fred. Fore me, exc'lent courtship! Iust like the parley 'Twixt Mounsier Hobbynoll, and Collen Clowt. Grid. I pray a word? I'm told I should expect Certaine duties from you too. Sciolt. May't please you Sonne, I shall be glad to learne. Grid. You must allow me still new choise of Armour, Brave Horse for service, and high pric'd Ginnets To curvett i'th streets, and rich cloathes. Sciolt. Heaven forbid else. Grid. Iewels, and mony too. Sciolt. O Sonne, I shall know my duty. Grid. And when the time conspires with my necessities To call you to't, You must make haste and dye. Fred. My Lord, how like you that? This breedings right: Nor is it altogether new, or strange. Sciolt: I'd rather ever find it on his tongue, Than once believe it in his heart: a rough boy; I must keepe him still from sight of the Ladies. It will continue him in's Innocence; hold Sir, This Key will lead you through the Tarris, that Orelookes the Orchard walke, and then you passe Into an Armorie, spend there your time A while, and take your choyce, I know the Duke That ownes it, will make good my gift: Will you walke Sir?â Grid. I pray Sir lead the way.â Sciol. Nay, I beseech you Sir.â Grid. I know 'tis fit, I give place to my Elders.â Sciolt. But I have businesse here, doe you thinke sonne, I'd be so much uncivill else, as not to wait upon you? Grid. Well, take your course, I love to see good Armor. Exit. Sciolt. If I can keepe him from the Ladies, I Am happier than King Priam that had fifty Sons, But sure, not one like thisâ Flourish a far off. Fred. My Lord, this summons shewes the Dukes are come, Sir, stand you here, Ile find a time for your addresse. Leads Castraganio aside. Enter Theander, Phylomont, Atendants. Within. Make way there, hoe! beare backe, beare backe! Theander embraces and whispers Phylomont. Fred. This is Theander Sir, whose present sway Palermo owes allegiance too, rich in His mind and fame, as in his large extent Of Land, and to augment his wealth, Hee comes Loaden with Spoyles of frequent victories, Though but i'th blossome of his life, hee hath Already done enough to fill a Historie, And is deriv'd from th'old Sicilian Kings: Him I have chosen to prefer you to. Castra. If I could double all my faculties, You have oblieg'd them wholly to your use. What is the other Signior, whom he seemes To court with such a fervent show? Fred. Duke Phylomont, that neighbours to his Government, And rules the Western borders of this Isle: All that the rich Mazara yields, he equals Duke Theander, in the best of's vertues, and his fate; And now brings too, though from a climate more Remote, the triumphs of a war; but yet If midnight howlings heard in Cities sack'd And fir'd, the groanes of widow'd wives, And slaughter'd childrens shrickes can pierce the eares Of heaven, the Learned thinke, their glorious Ghosts Will have a dismall welcome after death. How ever in this world 'tis good to follow 'um, I would not fright your nice and pious mind T'unprofitable feares. Castr. Kind Signior doubt me not. Theand. Thou breath'st into me (mighty Phylomont) No other soule but mine: my better thoughts Are moulded in thy breast; and could wee grow Together thus, our courteous hearts would not Be neerer, nor yet more intire; I gratulate Thy victories in Spaine, thou haste undone A Nation with thy noble deeds, and taught Them how to fight by seeing frequent conquests on Themselves, when brave examples come to late To immitate, and they are left no Land To fight for, or defend. Phyl. Renown'd Theander, what delight can wise Historians have to mention me, whilst Naples keepes The sense, or memory to mourne, thou art The argument of all just praise? alas, My battels will be thought, when thine are nam'd: But village-quarrels that poore Heardsmen make To keepe their Common from their Land-lords sheep. My Ensignes not deserve to hang As Curtaines at thy Shrine, when thou shalt lie Ador'd, and stil'd the Wars first Saint, That taught thy Armies how to clense, not sack The Citties thou hast won. Theand. No more; be these imbraces ever hearty, and Renew'd, till time shall lay us both asleepe within one Tombe. Phylom. I am no more alive. When these Shall cease, or thou absentst thy selfe by deathâ Theand. Sciolto, where's my sister (faire Ariola?) Me thinkes her welcomes are so slow, they scarse commend her love. Sciolt. Your Excellence will find She'le bring such an excuse with her, as soone Shall be receiv'd; the Princesse Eurithea Whom she's gone t'entreat, to honour this Solemnitie, they'le instantly appeare. Thean. That's joy indeed, the Musicke of her name, Salutes the eare, with sounds more cheerefull and More full of Triumph, then the showts of Victory! Phylo. As much doth faire Ariola surprize My sense, with gladnesse, wonder and with love. Fred. takes Theander aside. Fred. This is the Gentleman to whom your Grace Vouchsaf'd to promise Entertainement at My humble sute. Theand. He shall be well receiv'd: Sir, you had skill to know your businesse needs Must thrive, when you chose Fredeline your advocate. Castra. I am the creature of your excellence.â Enter Eurithea, Ariola. Theand. Brave Phylomont, intreat my Sister to Forgive a while the tendring of my love, Till I have breath'd it into thine. Phylom. The like request. Theander to my Sister make, Till thine have first receiv'd the righteous vowes And offrings of my heart.â Eurithea runs cheerfully to imbrace Theander; Ariola seemes to retreat a little at Phylomonts salute. Castra. Sir, our Theander and his Mistris meet (Mee thinks) with more allacritie, and free Consent, than Phylomont and his Ariola; Shee weares him at a carefull distance from her eyes. Fred. Right Sir, the first are Lovers of a pure CÅlestiall kind, such as some stile Platonicall: (A new Court Epethite scarce understood) But all they wooe, Sir is the Spirit, Face, And heart, therefore their conversation is More safe to Fame; the other still affect For naturall ends. Crastra. As how I pray? Fred. Why such a way as Libertines call Lust, But peacefull Polliticks, and cold Divines Name Matrimony Sir; therefore, although Their wise Intent be good and lawfull, yet Since it infers much Game and Pleasure i'th event, In subtle bashfulnesse, shee would not see me To entertaine with too much forwardnesse, What shee (perhaps) doth willingly expect: Sir this is but my guesse, and I beseech It may remaine a secret unto you. Castr. Signior, my lips are seal'd. Theand. O doe not strive t'afflict thy tendernesse With unkind thoughts, 'tis not the fortune of A day, the victors glory, when hee toyles To humble others pride, that he may swell His owne: nor yet to leade a Nation cold And naked forth, then bring them home, gay and Fantastick in their Silks, swetting in Furs Pontificall, as they had sate Like civill Iudges to redresse those men Whom for their owne reliefe they slew. No Eurithea, these were not the charmes That have so long betrayd me from thy sight. Eurith. Then I have cause to feare your wearinesse Of love, and that would poyson my weake faculties With a disease, that can admit no ease To sooth my willing hope, nor cure, but death. Theand. Old Pilots, when benighted, have more cause To doubt their Stars direction to their Card; Or th'Adamants true friendship to their Steele, Than thou, the loyaltie of my strong faith. Eurith. Three Sommers absent from your native Land And mee, as many tedious winters too, To make up time more sorrowfull and long; How can you fashion an excuse so well, as to expect beliefe? Theand. Truth wants no power: I went in search of vertuous fame, to make My selfe more fit in noble worth, For the encounter of thy love. Eurith. Alas! how are you certaine of my modesty That you should give me such continuall cause To Blush; I should finde courage sure To chide you for't, but that I'le minister No cause to hasten your remove from hence, Where I have hope my pray'rs and Innocence shall keep you long. Theand. Els I should loose such a felicitie, As he that hopes for better in the other world Must fast, and live severely to attain't. Phyl. The rugged fashion of the warre hath dull'd My understanding and my speech, or else Your eares (Ariola) have lately lost their wonted tendernesse. Ario. Sir, you doe willingly mistake in both: But 'tis because you know, you have as great A priviledge to injure me, as to abuse your selfe. Phyl. Shall I be heard then when I speake, and cheerfully A little listned to, that by degrees, I may recover my sick hope? Ariola. You cannot loose your vertue sir, and then I'm sure my courtesie will never faile: To promise more, would make me seeme too prodigall, Of what you cann't in noblenesse receive. Phylo. The favour of your hand I may, âOffers to kisse it. Ario. That not becomes your dignity.â Phylo. Indeed my bold ambition rather would Advance me to the sweetnesse of your lip.â Ario. That worse becommeth mine.â Phylo. Forgive me kind Ariola: I thrive By chastisement, and meane to sinne no more. Theand. Me thinkes since yonder building on the Mount, And that large Marble square was turretted, The house lookes pleasant, and would tempt us to Injoy the Sommer in't; what sayes my Phylomont? Shall we forsake the toyles o'th Campe, and here With triumphs celebrate the peace that wee Have purchas'd and deserv'd? Phylo. I'm here Theander govern'd by your Lawes, And must consent, but they are such I like. Theand. Come Eurithea, let me hasten to Begin my happinesse: lead to the Mertle-walke.â Exeunt all but Frede. Cast. Sciolto. Fred. My Lord, make me indebted to your eares A while, before you goe; this Gentleman May safely share with us i'th privacie. Castra. You doe me honour with your trust. Fred. How worthy 'tis of griefe, a Prince so young, Endow'd with all the helpes, that nature, art, Or fortune need to make up perfect man, Should weare away the happiest season of His strength, in tedious meditation thus, Severe discourses, and a cold survey, Of beauty that he loves, yet feares to use? Sciol. Oh Signior! It hath forc'd me make a very spunge Of my Pillow, I've wept at midnight for't, It is a thought too dangerous for one, Of's grey hayr'd friends to beare in memory. Fred. His name (if he continue ignorant O'th use of marriage thus) must perish with Himselfe, and all his glorious conquests have Atchiev'd, be left without an heire. Sciol. Right sir, for I believe those babies he, And Eurithea doe beget by gazing in Each others eyes; can inherit nothing, I meane by th custome here in Scicilie, As for Plato's Love-lawes they may entaile, Lands on Ghosts, and shaddowes for ought I know, I understand not Greeke. Castra. How sir is she inclin'd? Fred. As coldly as himselfe. Castra. Is there no way to tempt their simple loves to the right use? Fred. My Lord I have conceiv'd a remedy In my owne thoughts, 'tis an experiment, Which if your Lordships Iudgement can allow, May meet with glad successe Sciolt. I'm bound to heare't. Fred. There lives within Mesina (three leagues hence) One Buonateste, a Physician, and A sad Phylosopher, who though his wealth, Not makes him eminent, yet he is rich In precious vellum, and learn'd Manuscripts, Yellow'd with age, in old disjoynted Globes, And crooked Mathematick Instruments, Enow to fill a Braziers shop, which with His Magazin of coles, and Stils of glasse, For Chimick purposes is all he hath. Sciol. A very rich Alderman Phylosopher. Fred. Believ't (my Lord) this Kingdome will receive More future fame by being honour'd with His birth, then by our Ãschylus, our Diodore, Our Gorgias, and Empedocles, Euclide, And our Archymedes, who all tooke here Their knowledge, and their lives. Sciolt. Well Sir, wherein consists our present benefit? Fred. This man by Art shall make him marry whom Hee now so ignorantly Courts. Sciolt. That would incline much neere a Miracle. Fred. Reward my care but with your Patience, and Observe. I'm no protector of their silly faith, Who thinke (forsooth) that Phylters mixt with Hearbs, Or Min'rals can inforce a love, those Sir Are Fables, made to comfort distress'd Virgins, That want estates to marry 'um. Sciolt. How then Signior? Fred. I say my reason thinks it possible, With long indevour'd Art (where love is fix'd And enterchang'd already) by a free Consent, to heat their bloods into desire, And nat'rall appetite; And these desires They both may exercise (being married Sir) With leave of Custome, and our Lawes: You apprehend. Sciolt. With little labour Sir: Give me your hand, And let mee thanke you for't; for as you said, Though Art cannot inforce a mutuall love When it hath found a lover out, it can Provoke and warme him to doe notable feats. But by what subtle meanes is this perform'd? Fred. Hee hath a rare Elixir. Sciolt. Well Sir, you give much reason, and some hope: But in my greener yeares I thought no Elixir Like Powder'd Biefe, and good round Turnips to't, If eaten heartily, and warme. Cast. My Lord I'm your Disciple. Sciolt. Nay, I have found an humble Bee, pickled, Can doe as much as your Cantarides: But who will you imploy unto this Man Of Art? It must be secretly design'd. Fred. Castraganio, you Sir, shall straight take horse: My former trust imboldens mee to make No fitter choyce, this Letter will insinuate Our plot, which with five hundred Crownes that Purse Containes, may speed him hither ere't be night. Castra. My care shall make me worthy of your love. Fred. Farewell, be swift and prosperous. Sciolt. Ile in, and wait the Dukes commands.â Exeunt Sciolto, Castraganio, severally. Fred. This fellow hath a wondrous little skull; And sure, but halfe a soule, easie and fit To knead and manage in all formes, my darke Contrivements shall designe; but for My hum'rous Lord, that his old gowty feet Should stumble too into my snares, hath in't As much of fortune, as of mirth: Downe, downe, The secret troubles of my brest, I have Not long to mourne, if all my Arts prove safe; My midnight purposes are new and strange, But heavie headed Mules tread in the plaine And beaten Path; The fat dull Porpoyse still With danger, on the open water playes; Wise Serpents creep, in crook'd, and hidden wayes. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scen. 1. Enter Fredeline, Castraganio. Castra. Sir hee is come, I have divorc'd him from His bookes, and found his eyes imploy'd to reconcile Old Hierogliphicks by their shape, and then T'interpret blind halfe eaten Characters, Deform'd as Lock-smiths, or as Carvers tooles. Fred. Hath hee consider'd our request, and gives Some hope wee may find remedy in Art? Castra. With an industrious and exact survay: But in his mighty Science slights our feares, As 'twere a thing most easie to be done. Fred. My joyes (deare Sir) will grow too great for my Discretion to conceale. Castra. There's your Money. Fred. How! would hee not receiv't? Castr. Hee sayes hee likes your nature well, that you Could freely part with trifles of such high esteeme; And for that cause hee came, but will not sell The labours of his mind: Besides, profess'd, Those gilded Counters are not things hee loves. Fred. A Noble fellow! These Philosophick Blunt Booke-Gallants, have oft their Genty tricks Of nice honour, as well as Favorites, Whom Kings make wanton with their sudden wealth. Where have you now dispos'd him unto rest? Castra. Within your chamber Sir, and hee expects Your visitation will be straight perform'd. Fred. I am all speed, deare Sir; my tongue is much Too little to expresse my thankes: My select friend, Lord of my Functions and my Life, weare mee With what title your kind indulgent memory Shall please, so you will weare me long.â Exit. Castra. This Fredeline's a very Saint, so meeke, And full of courtesie, that hee would lend The devill his Cloake, and stand i'th raine himselfe. Sure I have suck'd some Sybils milke, I could Not be thus lucky else t'injoy his love. Enter Sciolto. Sciolt. So soone return'd? your haste fortels good newes. Castra. All will succeed my Lord (I hope) as if You had the certaine skill to make Your wishes prosperous; he is with Fredeline, And they expect your Interview? but looke.â Here comes my sister, and your sonne; he never saw A woman untill now; It will be sport Worthy your stay, t'observe how he demeanes himselfe. Sciolt. She's old and poore, he may safely enough converse with her. Enter Amadine, and Gridonell: (he gazing at her.) Amad. This Gentleman wants money, braine, or sleepe. Doe you know him Brother? Castra. Sweet Amadine, containe thy wit awhile: He never saw a woman, use him gently. Grido. This is a rare sight. One of the Angels sure, and a great Gallant among 'em; Had it but blew wings on the shoulders, it Could not be of lesse degree then an Angell. Sciolt. I perceive nature inclines men to wonder, And makes 'em somewhat rellish too o'th foole. Grid. An Angell of the better sort, some Lieutenant Coronell in Heaven (I take't) it cann't be lesse. Sciolt. Will he not speake to her? Grid. Sure it hath wings, and they are made (I think) Of Camebrick and Bonelace. Sciolt. A pox upon him, He lookes, as he had stolne a silver spoone, and it Were found sticking in his wrist. Grid. If she would fly Aloft, me thinks I should so peepe under her. Sciolt. All these are documents of nature still. Grid. Sure those I thinke are Petticoats, I've heard Of such a word; 'tis a fine kind of wearing: My new Coulors have just Taffata enough To fashion such another; would 'twere made, That I might practise how to walke in't. Sciolt. I'd beat him, but that the villain's roughly bred, And perhaps would strike agen. Cast. Speake to him Amadine. Amad. I'm mortall Sir; no Spirit, but a Mayd. Pray feele mee, I am warme.â Grid. Indeed forsooth I never felt a Mayd. Amad. Heaven keepe him from Pepper and Tobacco, For's braines are growne so loose in's head, they'l run Through's nose, next time hee chance to sneeze; And Dancing too will shake 'um out, it is An exercise too violent for that Disease. Sir, doe you use to dance. Grid. What's that forsooth? Amad. To dance Sir, is to move your Legs, as thusâ Grid. Wee use i'th wars to march and make a halt, And sometimes wee double our Paces, Amad. Fresh straw, and a strong chaine, the Gentleman Is mad, looke to him Brother. Exit. Sciolt. If I'd another sonne, I'de hardly trust Nature agen with his breeding. Grid. She said she was a Maid: and I've beene told A Maid's a kind of woman,â Sciolt. She is a woman sonne. Grid. If women be such things, I wonder th'enemy Doe never bring their wives against our Campe, To give us battaile, sure we should all yield. Sciolt. Belike then you have a month's mind to her. Grid. O sir, she hath the prettiest pinking eyes; The holes are no bigger then a Pistoll Bore. Castra. An excellent Similie for a Painter, That would draw a good face. Grid. Her fingers are so small, and longer then A Drum-stick; ah, how they'd bestirr themselves Vpon a phiph. Sciolt. Then you could leave the warres, and live with her? Grid. So she would still sit by and let me gaze till my eyes ake? Sciolt. Still he's Innocent, one of Plato's Lovers. Grid. Pray what was hee? Sciolt. An odd Greeke fellow that could write and read. Grid. O belike some Clearke of a Company. Sciolt. If he continue's wonder thus, and Ignorance To ev'ry woman that he meets, I may Intaile my Land upon the poore, hee'll not Be able to beget an Heire as big As my thumb, I must thinke upon some course. Enter Theander. Theand. My Lord Sciolto, I had thought your white And rev'rend head had held this season fit For sleepe; Night takes her swarthy Mantle up As shee would weare it straight. What Gentleman is this? Sciolt. Your grace may please to owne him for my child. His Mother Sir would justifie as much, Were shee alive. Theand. What, Gridonell? Men speake him of a great And daring heart, and skilfull how to vex The Foe, though hee be young. Sciolt. Faith if the Foe put but an Apron on, Or get his Corslet edg'd with Flanders Purle, Hee'l doe him little hurt. Theand. You are accus'd (My Lord) they say you bred him to no use Of Bookes, hee cannot Write, nor Reade. Sciolt. 'Twill keep him Sir, from entring into Bond. Theand. Let us begin acquaintance Sir, the day May come, when you shall lead my Ensignes forth, And though you bring them shot and ragged home, Yet they'l be crown'd with Wreathes. Grid. Strike up your Drums too night then, if you please, If th'Moone be froward Sir, and will not shine, Wee'l fire small Townes to light us as wee march. Sciolt. Masse! I thanke nature for that yet, hee has Good mettall in him. Theand. His meaning's straight and smooth, though's words be rough: I like him well, you must bestow him on mee. Sciolt. Most gladly Sir; and let me tell your grace, You'l find him one of the most exquisite Platonick Lovers this day living; hee will So innocently view and admire a Lady! Theand. Still fitter for my use. Soldier good-night. Exit. Sciolt. I must to Fredeline, and the Phylosopher. Exit. Castr. This woman was my Sister, Gridonell. Grid. And did one Father make you both? Castra. I Sir, and with a very little paines. Grid. My Father's old and lazie now, if hee'ld Take paines hee'ld soone make such another too For mee; but I shall see her Sir agen? Castr. Yes, when you please: shee must be gently us'd. Grid. Alas, I cannot choose. Would you would bring Her to my chamber in the dead of night? Castr. You must excuse mee Sir, farewell. Each houre I'th day shee may be yours. Grid. I shall so dreame. Exeunt. Enter Phylomont and Ariola, Rosella with Tapers. A Table with Night-linnen set out. Ario. Prethee unpin mee wenchâIf I were given Enough to Pray'r, or Cares, I could not be Thus incident to sleepe; take heed, you hurt meeâ Rosell. Your Ladiship is tenderer on the Brest Than you were wont; I would your heart were so. Ariol. Ile weare my Tuscan raile too morrow, smooth It out; but whence that wish Rosella? you Are still complayning on my poore heart. Rosell. Madam, these two long houres the noble Duke Hath waited at your Chamber dore. Ariol. Who? my Brother. Rosell. Duke Phylomont, who vowes t'inhabit there, Vnlesse you let him in. Ario. Heaven comfort his sicke soule: What does he meane, here lock these pendants up? The wonder of him makes me sickâIle use No powder nowâalas, what shall I doe? I dare not let him in, the season is not fit. Rosell. He vowes his visit shall be so precise And civill, that you need not counsell him, Nor check him with a frowne. Ariol. I but at night? Mens busie and officious tongues will talke. Rosell. Introth your Ladiship's too strict; when you Consider too your marriage is design'd: If my opinion (Madam) had authority, No times unfit, to Lovers so farre gone. Ariol. You'l be his Orator? goe, let him in. Enter Phylomont. Phylo. Me thinkes my faire Ariola, you keepe Your beauty overmuch infolded and Conceal'd, you are a flower that would become The night as sweetly as the day. Ariol. You make mee proud with your similitude; But whilst I gaine by it, your inference Must lose, Mary-golds now shut in their leaves. Phyl. Alas poore potage flower! Ariola Should imitate the Lilly and the Rose: They boldly spread themselves still open to The night, yet yield the Sun so fresh and sweet A sacrifice, that every morne he seemes To blush at's owne weake Influence, which can No longer keepe them beautious on their stalks, But they must drop, and perish with the spring, Your precious colour, and your odor too; My gentle Mistris needs must yield to time. Ariol. The losse will not be mourn'd for sir, since 'twill Be scarce discern'd. Phylo. Sweet, you remove your understanding from my words, and make Them of no use, their meaning would perswade You to enjoy this pleasant treasure, whilst It lasts; why are you still inclos'd thus like An Anchoresse, as if our conversation could Inferre a sinne? why am I nicely barr'd Your Chamber, when the Priest b'ing paid for a Few ceremonious words, must license me Your bed, your bosome too? Ariol. Our marriage sir may promise much, till then, Your excellence will grant me leave not to Admit of opportunities, that may give breath to ill report. Phyl. Be not so cruell in your bashfull care, My Sister makes all houres and seasons fit To celebrate Theander, and hee knowes No wrinckle on her brow, that may be call'd A frowne: O be you kind and free.â Offers at her hand. Ariol. By your chaste vowes forbeareâ Phylo. Theander may embrace my Sisters hand Untill with warmth he melt it from the wrist: Why should I have lesse am'rous priviledge? I have desires as bold, which will be made as lawfull too e're long. Ariol. The meaning of Their love is onely mutuall wonder and applause, And so proclaim'd; therefore can stir no jealousie In the severest thought: alas, wee must Be married Sir, which may perhap, inforce Your inclination to a dangerous hope. Phylo. Where is thy safety then Ariola? This is the dismall silent time, when Ravishers Reach forth their trembling guilty hands to draw The curtaines where unpractis'd Virgins sleepe; False Tarquins houre, when he did hide his Torch From Lucrece eies, and would not suffer her Wak'd Beautie to ecclipse that sicklie flame, Till shee had quench'd a greater in his blood. How would thy courage faint, if I should make Thee subject to my eager youth and strength? Ariol. Poore Phylomont, if thou shouldst so forsake Thy loyaltie to Love, yet I were still secure, And can subdue thee with my vertuous scorne; For now, though but my Cambrick Helmet on, Thus thinly harness'd in my Lawne, my triviall Fanne My Shield, I stand the Champion of our Sex. Alas! I faine would see the proudest of You bearded Tyrant men, that durst but hope To force from mee the least of these deshevell'd hairs, Which I will still as bounteous favours weare For ev'ry wanton wind to sport withall, But not for you. Phylo. Can you be angry? Ariol. Then you should sigh unto your selfe, And in your owne inamour'd eares distill The soothings of your cunning tongue, whilst I Injoy the quiet of my sleepe agen Without disturbance, by those midnight plaints Your mournfull consort at my window, made, Wherein you curs'd the guiltlesse Stars, who seem'd To smile, and winke upon each other in Their Spheares, as if they heedfull notice took of all your feigned griefe. Phylo. Can you be angry my Ariola? Or censure ought I spoke with an unkind Beliefe? Heare but my vowes. Ariol. Good nightâYour excellence hath greater power To move my sorrow than my rage. Phylo. Remember gentle Love, I have your heart By sacred plight, our Nuptials now draw neere. Ariol. I never knew the way how I might breake My Faith, but till that houre arrive, wee must Converse no more, no not at wary distance Sir, The cause is hidden in my brest. Vertue And Peace (my Lord) still governe your desires. Exit. Phylo. I shall grow mad with these delaies; Sh'ath made a vow never to marrie mee, Untill her Brother seal't with his consent. Ile move It to Theander e're I sleepe. Hymen! Goe light thy Fires, and make thy Tapers shine, Or cure me sacred Love, by quenching thine. Exit. Enter Amadine with a Taper, and Theander. Amad. Not in her Bed Sir yet, I left her with Her Lute, whose Musick I believe, hath woo'd her to a gentle sleep. Theand. Tread easie then, With a slow tim'rous pace; let's make lesse noyse Than Times soft feet, or Planets when they move.â Drawes a Canopie; Eurithea is found sleeping on a Couch, a vaile on, with her Lute. Give mee the light; now leave us, and retire. Amad. This is an odd kind of Lover, hee comes Into my Ladies chamber at all houres; Yet thinkes it strange that people wonder at His priviledge. Well, opportunitie Is a dangerous thing; it would soone spoile mee. Exit. Theand. Shee lies as in a shady Monument, Secure as Pious votaries that knew They were forgiven e're they dy'd. Eurith. Who's there? my Lord, the Prince? Theand. O, sleep agen, and close those eies that still Enlighten mine; till I have merited The beautie of their beames, by blessings, such, As loves religious Priests doe give, This sacred office would become mee well; 'Tis not a robe of Lawne, a hallow'd Verge, Nor flowry Chaplets nicely wreath'd, can adde Prosperitie to Prayers, or to Vowes, No formall Pompe, or Ceremonie needs To wishes that are cleane and humbly made. Eurith. Theander sit, where have you been so long? 'Las, wherefore doe I aske, since I So lately found you in my dreame? Theand. Vnvaile my loveâwhen this is but displaid, Thou openst like a fragrant bud before The mornings eye, whilst all that's neere thee is Perfum'd, thy breath converts me to a flowre, Weare me within thy bosome (Virgin friend) And I shall last in odour all the yeare. Eurith. Thou art Theander, and that name includes The sweetnesse of the Spring and Sommers wealth. Theand. Thou art not Eurithea, but my Rose, My sober bashfull flowre, and I Thy wanton Woodbine that must grow about Thee in embracements thus, untill thou art Intangled with chast courtesies of love. Eurith. This is a happinesse too great to last, Envie or Fate must lessen it, or we Remove 'mongst the eternall Lovers, and Provide our habitation neere the stars! My wonder growes upon me like my joy, O Theander! Theand. What sayes my Cherubine? Eurith. How shall I give my estimation words, When it would valew thee that art the warres Chiefe Souldier, best example and delight? So bold, thou dar'st seeke danger in a storme, When all the winds prepare to quarrell in The Baltick Sea; yet thou art milder then A captive Saint, so pittifull, that I Have seene thee weepe o're the distress'd, till thou Mightst give a name to Rivers as their spring. Theand. And thou (my Love) art sweeter far, Then Baulmy Incense in the purple smoake, Pure and unspotted, as the cleanly Ermine, ere The Hunter sullies her with his pursuit, Soft as her skin, chaste as th'Arabian bird, That wants a sex to woe, or as the dead, That are devorc'd from warmth, from objects, and from thought. Still Eurithea I could multiply thy praise, Yet still prove loyall unto truth; When I embrace thee thus, I strait forget, As weake delights, the dayes of victory, And glories of the warre. Eurith. But when you heare the Drum, and the shrill Trumpet call, You'l mount your angry Steed agen, and haste To live confin'd in Trenches, to exchange Your marble Palace for a Tent, whilst I Like a distress'd sad Turtle, am ordain'd To mourne without a mate. Theand. Doe not afflict me with thy jealous feares; I'm come to tell thee (Love) to morrow in Th'adjoyning Grove, Ile meet thee like A Shepherd, such as faire Arcadia bred, That with variety our old delights, May still seeme new. Eurith. A Lovers wish, Can imp the houres short wings, and hasten time, Looke up Theander, it is day. Theand. Where should I looke? Thou dost mistake the spheare, and residence O'th morne: let early village Labourers, And dull benighted Sea-men doe their homage to The East for light, the Region of our day We seeke like Lovers in the fairest eyes. Eurith. If you should looke in mine, twill still seeme night. Theand. To bed to bed: me thinke I heare the Larke, The Mornings merry Officer; and see Him shake his dewie wings, as he would strive To climbe high as his cheerefull voyce. Eurith. The best that Poets wishes can invent, Or Lovers prayers procure, thy sleepes injoy. Theand. And thine that precious harmony that dwells With quiet Hermits in their narrow cells. Exe. severall wayes. Enter Buonateste, Sciolto, Fredeline, and Castraganio. Buonat. I say (my Lord) your businesse doth concerne The blood, and not the Eyes; and since 'tis late, It were abuse of time to read long lectures Of the Opticks, to tell you their consent And unitie, or shew you through a perspective How Amorists oppos'd in levell to Each others sight, unite and thridd their beames, Vntill they make a mutuall string, on which Their spirits dance into each others braine, And so beginne short Iourneys to the heart; Or to reveale the shape and colour of Those Spirits too, that were a miracle, Worthy sublime, and powerfull Art! Sciol. Their Colour's Orange Tawny sir, as I conceive. Buonat. Your Lordship can conceive no more, than your Weake knowledge will give leave. Fred. To him Doctor. Buon. Nor doe I thinke it can concerne you much, Whether the nervall Conjugations be But seven, and of that mistick number too, Whether the Opticks bee the chiefe. Sciol. For your seven Conjugations sir, you shall Excuse mee, but beleev't the seven wise Masters Is a Volume I read much in my Youth. Buon. Your Lordship gives good proofe of't in your age: But yet you never heard sir of the fam'd Antipheron, whom once the learned Stagerite Admir'd so for the selfe-reflection that He wore like to his perfect Image still where hee mov'd. Sciolt. No more, my good wise friend, thou hast My wonder, that's enough; my understanding Shall come after, but not till I am dead, For then they say wee shall know all things Without paying for our Bookes. Buon. There is the Powder Sir. Fred. Give it to my care. Buon. The Duke must take it in his draught too night. To morrow, as the Sun increaseth in His power, it works; at noone you'l see pure Miracles. Fred. My Lord, 'tis fit our Castraganio give It him: hee takes a rowse of Corsick wine Still e're hee sleepes; hee, waiting in his chamber May fitly mingle and present it to himâ Castra: takes the Paper. Castr. Ile use my safest diligence. Sciol. Where is he now? Castra. With Eurithea Sir; hee hath not call'd. Sciolt. Staies hee so long? 'tis now i'th ken of day. Signior Buonateste, have you no more Of this rare Magicall stuffe? Buon. Another Doce; I came provided Sir. Sciol. Pray give it me. Buon. Most willingly, but to whom will you dispos't? Sciol. Unto no other but my Son: I find Hee's very much Platonically given. Buon. My Lord, I still beseech you not to wrong My good old friend Plato, with this court calumnie; They father on him a Fantastick Love Hee never knew, poore Gentleman, upon My knowledge sir, about two thousand yeares Agoe, in the high street yonder At Athens, just by the corner as you passe To Diana's Conduit (a Haberdashers house) It was (I thinke) hee kept a wench. Sciol. How sir, a wench? Buon. I could say more, my friend was lewdly given. Sciolt. But with your favour Sir, a plump browne wench? Buon. Faith Authors differ about that; some write Shee had a Flaxen haire, and others too, That did not blush to know more private markes, Say shee had a Mole under her left thigh: Others, a hollow Tooth, that put him to The charge of Cloves, because her breath grew somewhat troublesome Fred. Give mee thy hand Doctor; Ile have some share too in thy heart E're long: But did not Plato write of Love? Buon. Divinely sir, but not such kind of Love As Ladies would have now, they mistake him. Sciolt. Hee wrote in Greeke, Doctor. Buon. True my good Lord. Sciolt. Why then belike my Son mistakes him too, Hee understands no Greeke; this Doce shall conjure him, I'le give't him strait. Come sir, the night decaies Apace, let me direct you to your Bed. Buon. Your Lordships kindnesse honors mee too much. Fred. My jolly deere Philosopher, good-night. Exeunt Sciolto and Buon. Sir, you have found with what assur'd, and confident A soule I give you Interest in all My businesse, and my thoughts. Castr. Signior, I plead no merit but your bounty. Fred. And now under the same protection of Your friendship and your trust, I must reveale A secret that doth oft inforce me walke With armes enfolded thus, still to combine And fasten in my ribs, lest it should split My brest: and you shall know it sir, I love, (Curs'd Fate, that I must utter it) I love The Princesse Eurithea. Castr. Signior (indeed) This will deserve to be a secret, and securely kept. Fred. So love her sir, that men In fierce conspiracie, dispaire, or want, Injoy more quiet sleepes than I; and since I am declin'd much into weaknesse, and Unpleasant yeares: you see what narrow hopes Are left to give my furious appetite successe. Castra. Introth 'tis pittie sir. Fred. There you express'd the charitie And melting nature of a Friend, and may Administer redresse, for it will much Reflect within your power. Castra. You cannot want it then; but sir, it seemes preposterous And strange to my dull braine, that since Your love doth force you wish her to your selfe, You strive by marriage to bestow her on The Duke, and with such heartinesse and care. Fred. In this your friendship is agen conjur'd, I doe beseech you never seeke the end Of that misterious cause; some Salt I have That shewes th'Italian humour in my Blood. I not affect to compasse my designes The Vulgar way. Castr. But how can I redresse your griefe? Fred. Your Sister Amadine, is in affection and attendance, neere The Princesse person and her mind, shee may By your intreatie render mee in such A character of cunning praise, as shall Advance mee to her love perhaps, at least, To a refreshing of my sick desires. Castra. Shee's bound in conscience sir to doe good Offices. Fred. But wilt thou charme thy Sister with all force Of thy affinitie and words, to be my friend, Indeere us so, that I may whisper my Owne cause, and teach her mediate my accesse? This must be done to morrow, for delayes Will make my griefe too dangerous to beare. Castr. To morrow doubt it not, my Functions shall Intirely bee imployd to your best use. Frede. I had almost forgot: the Med'cine; it Is late, and time 'twere working in his draught: Farewell: Command mee to the losse of Fame, Of Treasure, and of Life: deare Castraganio, Be but benigne, and chaine mee as thy slave. Exeunt severally. Enter Philomont, Arnoldo, and Iaspero with lights Phylo. I thought t'have found him safe in's quiet rest, With's Curtains drawne ere this. Is it his use to stay so long? Arnol. The visits hee presents unto your Graces Sister, Though at night, are never hastily perform'd. Iasper. Times gowtie leggs may tire, if hee run on, Untill such true and faithfull Lovers finish their discourse, As wearisome and long. Arnol. Iaspero, that's the morne Which so inflameth yonder Cloud. Iasp. Is it your Graces will, wee goe and trie to hasten his approach? Phylo. Please you to trust Mee heere alone, Ile stay his comming Sir, My businesse askes a private conference.â Exeunt Arnol. Iaspero My Sister is so bounteous of her love, And gives her favours with such bold neglect Of Fame, that but I knew the pure and chaste Condition of her soule, I should grow vex'd With jealous feares. Ariola will not vouch safe To use me so. Enter Theander. Theand. My Phylomont, this is a season when Your visit would import some great affaire That carries haste or wonder in't. Phyl. You have a Mistris sir, preserves Your spirits full of Fire, your glad heart keepes Eternall triumph in her close warme throne, Whilst mine increaseth not in joyes, but weight; 'Tis heavie sir, if it continue so 'Twill breake the strings. Your froward Sister. Theand. Will shee not love? I'm sure her Beautie was Ordain'd for no felicitie but Love; Her sweetnesse and her formes, though shee were lesse Ally'd unto my nature, would proclaime it to the world. Phylo. Sir, shee hath banish'd mee. Theand. Upon what rock or promont, Was shee by A Scythian nours'd, that shee is growne so cruell? It cannot be. Phyl. Th'affliction will not long indure (I hope) because you may repeale the doome. Theand. You are assur'd my Phylomont, I needs Must strive to further love; what shall I doe? Phylo. Give your consent, that I may marrie her. Theand. How! marrie her! Your soules are wedded Sir, I'm sure you would not marrie bodies too, That were needlesse charge. Come, you shall save Your bridall Feasts, and Gloves. Phyl. This mirth Sir is a little too remote From th'answer I should have. Theand. Blame my conception then; I understand You not: To what purpose would you marrie her? Phyl. Why Sir? to lie with her, and get Children. Theand. Lye with my Sister Phylomont! how vile And horridly that sounds! I prethee sleepe A while, 'tis thy distemper, and I pardon it. Phyl. This is strange, being married, is't not lawfull sir? Theand. I grant it may be Law, but is it comely? Reduce thy reason to a cleaner Sense, Thinke on't a noble way. You two may live, And love, become your owne best arguments, And so contract all vertue, and all praise: Be ever beautious, fresh, and young, at least In your beliefe; for who can lessen, or Defile th'opinion which your mutuall thoughts Shall fervently exchange? and then you may Beget reflections in each others eies, So you increase not children, but your selves A better, and more guiltlesse progenie; Those immateriall creatures cannot sin. Phyl. But who shall make men sir, shall the world cease? Theand. I know not how th'are made, but if such deeds Be requisite, to fill up Armies, Villages, And Cittie shops; that killing, labour, and That couz'ning still may last: know Phylomont, I'd rather Nature should expect such course And homely drudgeries from others than from mee. Phyl. And yet you had a Father Sir. But why doe I tell him so? that was His Mothers fault, not his. This is mad doctrine. Ile bid your excellence good-night, but first Ile leave this information in your eare; You'l find your Sister of my mind, she faine would marrie too. Theand. Oh prodigie! belike Shee understands then what it meanes, wrong not A Ladie sir, whose innocence is such, Shee weares no blushes for her selfe, but you. Leave mee, although our friendship sir be great, My patience is too little to subdue My rage; to Bed my gentle Phylomont, If thou art guiltlesse, thou wilt sleepe. Phyl. Ile take your counsell sir, The morning may reclaime us both. Exit. Theand. O poore Ariola, where hast thou chang'd Thy bashfull virtue for unchaste desires? Thy eares are blister'd with lascivious breath, Thy understanding is become thy crime; I shall not know thee when I meet thee next, Thy very soule is sullied, and thy bloud That ran so pure, will now grow black with Sin, Till't make thy beautie like an Ãthiops skin. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scen. 1. Enter Theander, Ariola. Ariol. Your lookes are clouded sir, I feare your health Is alter'd, or your mind perplex'd. Theand. Your lookes, Ariola, will shortly too decay; Whilst by their strange and early perishing. Your former Beautie must be quite forgot, Like sullen Roses that would wither on The Bough, e're throughly blowne, e're gather'd for The Still; so lose all memorie that they were ever sweet. Ariol. I need instructions what you would infer. Theand. Have you no secret sicknesse in your blood? Ariol. Not that I feele, nor doe I thinke my Prayers So vainly made, that I should perish yet. Theand. Have you not heard of late some new discourse, Such as inflam'd you to desire strange practises Of heate, trials of Youth, I know not what They are; but Nature oft doth put odd tricks On young and curious fooles, which still The bashfull may resist. Ariol. If to be ignorant, Be safe, I am to learne sir what you meane. Theand. Indeed! looke up, and with a Virgin confidence Contemne th'inrag'd severenesse in my brow, By urging that for truth without a blush. Ariol. Alas, you have amaz'd mee sir, but I Dare looke i'th face of heaven, write all my willing faults, And stand unvail'd whilst they are read. Theand. Perhaps shee is abus'd. Ariola, Pray tell mee the request you sent by Phylomont; I know not how I understood it then, But sure t'hath troubled all my powres. Ariol. I sent you none but what was good and lawfull. Theand. Are you become so wise In wickednesse, to chuse offences that The lawes protect? Th'ambitious in the worlds First Age, invented them to gather wild And wandring Nations into Townes and Forts: And so rais'd Common-wealths, for their owne pride To rule, those cunning Scriblers knew that Lawes Make Subjects, and tame Slaves, not virtuous Men; Live thou as not to know or need their use. Ariol. I can be farther justifi'd, for my request Was fit and modest too. Thean. Then you may name't. Ariol. I gave him leave fairely to question your consent, That wee might marrie Sir. Theand. Doe you already know what that word meanes? Ariol. Your judgement had sufficient cause to blame My breeding else: I have been often told It's sacred Institution, and the use For which 'twas first ordain'd. Theand. The use, Ariola? Sh'ath rarely profitted Since my long absence from her at the Campe: Who read these Lectures in your eare? If 't were A woman, sure, shee fastned on her Maske To hide her blushes whilst shee talk'd. Ariol. In my weake judgement sir, you are too nice, And make uncomely misterie of that Which both the learned and the noble have Allow'd and taught; and such as vestals may Discourse, yet not be banish'd from their holy lamp. Theand. But to remaine a vestall still (Ariola) To live in sweet unskilfull virgin-hood, The Angels life, for they no sexes know, But ever love in Meditation, not in Act. Hah! is not this a sweetnesse far beyond The pleasures that our appetites create? Ariol. Sir, it is excellent and free, but I Am told, the next degree of happinesse, The married challenge, and enjoy. Thean. O she is lost! I will Goe weepe into the Sea, and sooner hope To find my unmix'd teares upon my cheeke Agen, than her perverted heart reclaim'd Unto her former innocence. Reach mee Your hand; you are my prisoner now, and must Be kept from sight of Men. Ariol. Sir, though I cannot learne m'offence, yet I Shall soone be taught t'obay. Theand. If since thy late perversion thou hast left But one acquaintance in sweet heaven, that dares Befriend thy Orizons, kneele to him strait. Ariol. Though you are cruell growne, you cannot want My tender wishes, that your angry thoughts. Be to their peacefull harmony restor'd!â Exit. Thean. seemes to locke her in. Theand. Yet am I not left desolat, to mourne With single griefe, this ruin'd Virgins fate: My Eurithea when she heares of her Revolt, will sigh her piteous soule away to ayre. Enter Phylom. Phyl. Theander I am come to learne. If yet Your temper can with kind, discreet civillity, Returne an answer to my suit? Theand. Sir, y'have undone a noble Mayd, one nurs'd In such severe behaviour of her minde, So meeke and humble in desires, she seem'd Much fitter for a Cloister then a Court; But now she aymes at libertie and change. Phyl. What I have taught her sir, Hermits and Nunnes Might in their dying minutes listen to, Without disquiet to their parting soules; And things lesse chaste I know, she would not heare. Theand. Take heede my Princely friend? Doe not augment Thy crime, by owning as thy knowledge, what Is yet, but the mistake of thy beliefe; I had a hope thy vaine conceptions would Be mended much by sleepe. Phyl. Well, Ile be briefe. Your Sister I would marry sir, and then As Lords and Princes use, that love their wives, Ly with her. Theand. Your are too Masculine? Name not those words agen: you blast me with Your breath, poore Ruffians in their drinke, that dwell In Suburbe Alleies, and in smoaky Lanes, Are not so rude; leave me: My anger may Vndoe us both. Phyl. Theander, can you thinke To fright me hence, or is it safe to chide Me from my businesse with bold words? I would Be better usde; tell me (I pray) is this All the fit answer my demands shall have? Theand. All sir, and more then I can patiently Allow, your conversation never could be lesse esteem'd. Phyl. I feare your noble reason is diseas'd, Where I have lov'd, affliction makes me pittifull, And where I pitty, I can nere intend Revenge: farewell injurious Prince, but know, If I can get your Sisters kinde consent, Ile not endeavour yours. Theand. Goe not deluded with that triviall hope: She is my prisoner lock'd and inclos'd, From all addresse that force or oportunity Would make, thou shalt behold her face no more. Phylo. Hah! Imprison'd! I sooner would cage up The little Bird, that sung a Requiem or'e My mothers Hearse: the sad domestick Redbreast, or The courteous Wren, that strew'd with Cypresse leaves Th'unburied Pilgrim in the field: examine sir Your troubled memory. It cannot be. Theand. You'le find it most expedient, and a truth. Phyl. Imprison her! her beauty will breake foorth. You may as soone in Christall Iayles confine The Sunnes refulgent Beames, climbe heaven, reach downe A Starr, and in a Lanthorne shut it, as imprison her! Theand. This iteration will But vexe us both. Farewel! you may believe't At leasure sir, time will perswade you to't. Phyl. Theander, stay; marke how I cancell all Th'affection, merit, and the glorious vowes Wee interchang'd in war, the parting teares Wee shed, when in the day of battell our Bold troopes wee did divide against the Foe: And those embraces made, when met agen, Ioy'd and exalted with our victorie, Are now eternally forgot. Theand. I should lament this losse, had you preserv'd Your vertue still, and puritie of heart. Phyl. Till three round journies of the Sun expire, Ile give thee leisure to repent, but then Release thy Sister to her free converse, And publike view, or I will spread my Ensignes here, And 'gainst thy Pallace fix my Cannon, till I batter it to dust. Thean. Poore Phylomont, how I neglect thy furie when it dares Inkindle mine? If Fate resolve, wee that In forraigne Climes made others mourne, so soone Must bleed at home; yet e're wee part, let us Salute like civill EnemiesâFarewell. When next wee meet, 'twill be in danger, noyse, And sulph'rous smoke; for Eurithea's sake, Thy Fetters shall be Silver, and thy Bonds of Silke. Phyl. And for Ariola's, if thou shalt fall Beneath my Sword, I will imbalme thee with my Teares; My eyes grow moist with pittie of our Fates. Theand. And mine with sorrow melt so fast away, I shall be left in darknesse if I stay. Exeunt. Enter Castraganio, Fredeline, and Amadine. Castr. This Gridonell is young and simple sir, Admires all women with a tame extasie. And then my Sister Amadine (you know) Hath a most pure contriving Wit; if wee Could get him marrie her, it were a stratagem Would make us rich and famous. Fred. But will you bring her to him now? Castra. That's our designe. Fred. Hast thou o'rewatch'd thy selfe? art mad? Castra. Why Signior? Fred. 'Tis past the time two houres, when by our great Physitions date, the Med'cine 'gan to worke. I doe believe, the Duke e're this hath felt Some sudden diff'rence in his Mayden bloud: And Gridonell I'm sure, drunke his full share; 'Twill worke him to such furie, hee will ravish Thy poore Sister, nay eate her up, not leave A morsell big enough to beare her name, Or memorie that such a creature was. Castra. Shee's old, and tough, and will be sure to put Him Sir, to th'triall of his teeth: but I Had quite forgot, hee tooke the Med'cine, wee Must chuse some other time. Fred. As for your sisters marriage Sir, with Gridonell, trust my plots, such I Have laid, as shall joyne hearts and hands, then straight Bring 'um to bed, I thinke sir, shee desires no more. Castra. Sir, you obliege us with new benefits. Fred. Some cause you'l have to say so now, read thatâ 'Tis a Commission I procur'd the Duke This morning signe, which gives you a company In's Regiment garison'd at Mesina: So you are now my friend and Captaine Castraganio. Cast. The latter adds to my revenew sir, the first to my content. Fred. Have you imploy'd your Sister Amadine in my behalfe? Castra. Sir, there shee stands, readie to execute All you injoine, to th'hazard of her life. Fred. Sweet Amadine, your kindnesse can excuse An old sinner, whose fraile, weake flesh, Nature Intending to keepe long, a little hath O're-season'd with her salt, I would be glad Sometimes to be refresh'd; I know you hold The Princesse in your power; will you indeere Mee to her faire esteeme, procure mee such Addresse as may be oportune and fit? Amad. Sir, I've alreadie mov'd your praises with Some vehemence; it prospers too, as far As good opinion of your person and your parts. Fred. And is there hope wee may converse, by Star, Or Moone-light yet be so maydenlie to call To have the Curtaines drawne? Amad. This sir, with good endeavour may be done. Fred. Then cough and make a noise, till wee Grow wittie in our feares, and breake small Ieasts, Laugh out agen, and lift the apron up To stifle slaughter, till't be crush'd into A grave and silent smile. Amad. But meaning sir no harme? Fred. And whisper close, till in the darke, the lips Be oft mistaken for the eares, and then Laugh out, and wake the Posset-eating Nurse. Amad. Still meaning sir no harme? Fred. None I protest, mine's pure Platonick Love. Castra. My Sister Signior is inquisitive, Guiltie of my offence, shee ask'd mee e're You came, why you indevour'd thus to have The Ladie married to another, whom you meant to love? Fred. That's the Platonick way; for so The Bals, the Banquets, Chariot, Canopie, And quilted Couch, which are the places where This new wise Sect doe meditate, are kept, Not at the Lovers, but the Husbands charge, And it is fit; for marriage makes him none, Though shee be still of the Societie. Amad. And may besides her husband, have A sad Platonicall servant to helpe her meditate. Fred. All moderne best Court Authors doe allow't. Amad. You give good light into the businesse sir. Fred. Were Eurithea married, I would teach Her the true Art, shee is unskilfull yet. Amad. Hymen may burne his Taper to a snuffe Before wee see her wedding day; there's nothing comes So seldome in Theanders thought Fred. But are you serious? Amad. I've newly dress'd her like a Shepherdesse; And hee i'th old Arcadian habit meets Her strait, to whine and kisse, that's all they doe. Fred. How? 'tis two full houres since the prefix'd time Our Artist did prescribe his Charme should operate; I hope hee hath not us'd us thus. Castraganio, Captaine, I'd forgot: deare sir, hasten, and see How it doth worke with Gridonell: You, gentle Mistris, shall conduct mee to Some covert in the grove, where I may best Observe Theander and his talke; it will concern me much. Exeunt. Enter Arnoldo, Iaspero, Gridonell. Arnol. This creature you so admire, is but The Princesse woman Sir. Iasp. A very creature, and doth serve. Grid. Would I might serve her, Gentlemen; I long To weare a Fan, I have a tossing Feather In my chamber as broad as a Sycamore tree, It will make two dozen of Fans. Arnol. But for what uses could you serve a woman? Grid. Instead of rearing a square Sconse, I'd learne To raise up Past; and then for push o'Pike, Practise to poke a Ruffe. Iasp. These quallities will make your wages Sir, At least foure Markes a yeare. Grid. My Corp'rall shall serve too. It is an honest fellow, and a Lover; He may wash bucks, and scowre dishes, instead of Armour. Arnol. Is he a Lover too? Grido. O I! he loves women; dares talke and handle 'em: And would tell such pretty tales of a Fine gentle damsell that he knew. Ias. What was she? Grido. I never saw her sir, but she boyld Chestnuts, And sold bloat herring in the Leaguer. Arnold. There are waies left for you to compasse Amadine, Better then service: you should woe, and winne her. Grido. Pray Gentlemen, how doe they use to woe? Arn. Why, with fine language. Grid. What's that sir, French? Ias. French is indeede the smothest and most prosperous. Grido. Alas! I can speake none, but a few words We use i'th warre, as at our court de Guard, We cry Que va la. Arnol. That sir, will serve, When you shall meet your Mistrisse in the darke. Grido. And then after a battaile Randze vous. Ias. That may be us'd sir, when shee's obstinate, And will not yield to love. Grid. This is all my fine language. Ias. Women are woo'd with Musicke too? Grid. Will the Drumme and Trumpet serve, with sad songs Set to 'em to the tune of a dead March? Arnol. Yes, at the Fun'rall of a Generalls wife: But there is yet another meanes, they oft Are woo'd by letters elegantly penn'd. Grid. I, you are happy that can write and read. I was taught once to set my marke to a Shoo-makers Bill. Enter Castraganio. Castr. Arnoldo, do's this Soldiers humor last? Arnol. Still more, hee's growne demurer than A young Geneva Bride; commits Idolatrie To every Lawndresse in the house, and dares Not speake to 'um, but with his hat in's eies. Castr. Belike the Med'cine hath not wrought; Ile lead Him to my Sister: Follow sir, this is The blessed houre, wherein you shall behold Faire Amadine, and court her too. Grid. Good Gentlemen, pray goe and beare mee out; But teach mee how to weare my Cloake, and when I should pull on my Gloves.â Exeunt. Enter Fredeline, Sciolto, Buonateste. Fred. Wee are undone: I found him lying in A Poplar shade, with colder thoughts about him, Than old Carthusians have when they are sick: Lesse apt for our veneriall Love than Muscovites Benighted when they travell on the Ice. Sciolt. And workes so little with my Son, hee stands Moping, and fix'd, as hee were to be sold To a Stone-cutter for a Marble statue. Buon. My Lord, I'm lost in my astonishment, Some envious Spirit checks my Art, it was Not wont to faile the strictest minute given, To make the virtue and effect appeare. Sciolt. This is the Powder that you priz'd so high, As 'twere a grated Carbuncle, or that Long Diamond pounded which the Sultan weares upon his thumb. Fred. Where's your Phylosophie? your strong deepe Art, That piercing through the Center, would looke downe To Hell, there number all the Fiends, and take Account, how many load of Coales is every yeare Allow'd for their expense? Sciolt. Yes sir, and when the Sun Is blowne out by a strong Northerly wind, You'ld undertake agen to light him with A Torch heav'd up by a long Iacobs staffe. Buon. My Lord, I smile at these vaine injuries You doe to Art, not mee, 'tis fitter for Your wonder than your mirth; but take your course. Fred. Since your great Master Aristotle dy'd, (Who fool'd the drunken Macedon out, of A thousand Talents to buy Bookes) what have The multitude of's learn'd successors done, Wrote Comments on his workes; light, I could beat You all, have you so many Ages toyl'd T'interpret what hee writ in a few yeares? Is there yet nothing new, to render benefit For humane life, or strengthen reason for Our after hopes? Why, doe wee build you Colledges? Sciolt. Yes, and allow 'um Pensions too, that they May scribble for no end, but to make Paper deare. Buon. For one unluckie scape in knowledge, must I suffer all this tyrannie? Sciolt. You studie Phisick too? Fred. Hee knowes to cure sick Chickens o'the Pip. Sciolt. I'ld faine see one of that profession live Five hundred yeares without losse of a tooth. Fred. No Sir, they'l suffer ruine and decay In their owne bodies for examples sake, That others may fall sick and make 'um rich. Sciolt. Right Fredeline, for notwithstanding, all Their Min'rals and their hearbs, wee must be faine At last to betake our selves to the wide yawne, Grinning, and the long stretch. Buon. You make all knowledge But deception sir, and Cheaters of the learn'd Phylosophers. Fred. Troth little lesse, the merry Fop of Thrace, That alwaies laugh'd, pretending, 'twas at vanitie; Alas, 'twas his disease, going to steale Mushromes for his supper, the blew mouth'd Serpent skulk'd Under a Dock leafe, and hit him by the thumbe, From whence hee tooke that laughing Maladie. Sciolt. And his Antagonist would ever seeme To weepe out of a Pious cause, a fine Dissembling fellow, 'twas not sorrow made him weepe. Buon. No sir, make that appeare. Sciolt. Ile shew a Manuscript, now kept i'ch Vatican that proves He had nine yeares a Fistula in's eie. Fred. Meere couz'ners all. Sciolt. As for Diogenes, that fasted much, And tooke his habitation in a Tub, To make the world believe hee lov'd a strict And severe life, hee tooke the diet sir, And in that very Tub, swet for the French disease. Fred. And some unlearn'd Apothecarie since, Mistaking's name, call'd it Cornelius Tub. Buon. My noble friends, make much still of your spleenes, Tickle your selves with strawes, if you want sport, I shall have my revenge e're long. Sciolt. I thinke y'have poyson'd the Duke, and my Son too. If it be found, Ile cut your throat so wide Open, that when you take your Morning's draught, You shall goe neere to spill your drinke. Buon. My Lord, I scorne your callumnies; Ile to Messina, and contemne you both. Exit. Sciolt. My feares mis-give mee Fredeline; if hee Should now take horse, and leave us here to owne His trecherous fact, that were a fine Phylosophie. Fred. Unlesse he have the subtle art to flie, wee'l overtake him; He shall not stir, untill we know his med'cines quality. Exeunt. Enter Theander like a noble Shepherd. Theand. Three wearie circuits of the Sun expir'd, Fierce Phylomont and I shall meet To know the diff'rence of our Stars, till then Ile practise Rites of Love: My Eurithea must Not know our anger, nor the cause. Come forth My Princely Shepherdesse, and leave thy Lambs (Lesse gentle than thy selfe) whilst wee a while Enter Eurithea like a Shepherdess. Grow pensive in this gloomy shade. Eurith. Why should we hide our selves Theander from The free discoveries of the light, that know Not guiltinesse to cause a bashfull feare. Theand. This greene and fragant pallace tempts our stay, Here sit, where Nature made the sharper sented bryer, And luscious Iesmine meet to quallifie And reconcile their diffring smels within The hunnie woodbines weak and slender armes; sit neerer, wee are Too remoteâ Eurith. How, my Theander, am I still subdud With thy chaste victories upon my heart? Would heaven had nere begun these joyes, till it Had kindly promis'd they should never end. Theand. Yet whilst they last, wee'l strive to make the strict Example of our love, an easie Law, unto the vaine fantastick world. Eurith. The nimble Dwarfe, And lazie Evenuch then (which are the spies And messengers of their blind god) might rest Upon their quilts, at home, for all their toyles And simple business upon earth should cease. Theand. And that small god himselfe (who ne're could tempt Wise Poets to increase his stature, or To mend his eyes, as knowing what A uselesse Deitie they mad) might soone Goe shake his Quiver, and unplume his Shafts. The influence with which his fond Idolaters Are giddily inspir'd, is incident to falshood and to change. Eurith. But our affection, Time, nor sad distresse Have power to alter or destroy. Theand. Yet say the furie of some sudden war Should leade us captive to a cruell Land, Couldst thou indure the frownes of Destinie, And be thus beautious still? When scornfull men Shall aske, where now are all those Persian Loomes Your Lovers flowing wealth imploy'd to weave Your vestments ever new, when you appear'd Like gawdie Aprill in Cecillian Meades, Or various Tulips in the Ides of May? Eurith. Feare not my love; the homely weeds spun by The course and heavie finger'd people, that Reside i'th neighbour vale, should well become My beauty then, since humbled by my thoughts, The briske pert linnet in his russet Feathers flyes, As warme as any Bird of Paradise With all his painted and his guilded trim. Theand. But oh! me thistles I heare thy mourning, and The sawcie Foe demand, where are those Fumes Of sweet Assyrian Nard, wilde Cypresse Boughes, And sifted Amper of the Southern Sea, Which ever as you mov'd, Theander burnt, Pretending sacrifice, but 'twas to hide You in those costly mists, from Rivals eyes. Eurith. Then with my wiser scorne I shall reply, For sweets, behold yond' bed of Violets, That leane and hang their heads together, as They seem'd to whisper and consult, how to Preseve their odor to themselves, whilst neere Each Christall brooke the jolly Primrose stands Triumphing on his stalke, as he disdain'd His hidden roote, ambitious to be worne Within a chaste, although a captives breast. Theand. Sill, still me thinkes, this rugged conqueror Derides thee with his Iron wit, and askes Where are the whispers of your amorous Lute, That sooth'd you into slumbers till your dreames Became your greatest sinne. Eurith. When I shall musick need, Ile say each tree Doth entertaine a Quire at natures charge: And what is he dares touch the Tuscan Lute, Whilst in the night he heares the Bird begin Her pensive notes; whose feather'd Ancestor the firie Tereus wrong'd? Theand. And whilst thy dayes of bondage last, thou shalt With artfull needle draw in silken Imagry, The stories of our fatall love, and learne T'out worke that mistick nourserie of Maidsâ Theander gazing on her, rises and starts. The Phrygian Sybill taught. Eurith. Ay me, what sudden terrour shakes you thus, Into a wild demeanor of your lookes? Theand. Such fire as this, I have not felt before, It boyles my liver, and it burnes my heart, My blood runs flaming till my scorched veines, Together cur'll like broken treble strings. Eurith. Tell me, the best of Princes, what's your griefe? Theand. Tis strange; come Eurithea let us walke. Eurith. Will you divide your troubles from my breast? Shall I not know your griefe, which though My pitie cannot remedy, my prayers may? Theand. It is a Fire, kindled and bred in Hell For it perswades, and warmes me to a guilt: As strange and distant from my knowledge, as My will; move on my gentle Love. Oh stay! goe back! Goe back a while, till I've subdu'd my thoughts. Eurith. Helpe him sweet heaven, preserve his reason safe.â Theand. Nay, doe not weepe; those watrie obsequies Serve to lament, not quench such Fun'rall fire as mine. Eurith. A Funerall fire? Theand. O yes; 'twill burne me after death, though thou Couldst drop more showres than Aprill weepes when March Hath blowne the ruder winds into his eies; Though every teare thou shedd'st were swell'd into A wave, thou couldst not quench this secret fire. Eurith. Deare Theander! Thea. Hide, hide thy beauty e're Thou speak'st; put on thy vaile: nay, closer yetâ She vailes her self Eurith. You carefull Angels that reside above, Can you have businesse of more grace or need, Than to consider such a change as this? Theander, speake; what may it meane? Theand. To name it, were such impudence, as Bawds And Ravishers cannot attaine, till they Are growne long exercis'd, and old. Eurith. These words are newer than the wondrous cause That gives them breath. Theand. Bold devill! thou imperious flame, Sure I shall stifle thee at last. Now come My Eurithea, let's move on, thy strong O'recomming beautie clouded thus, wee may Converse, and safely too I hope. Alas, Why do'st thou weepe? O sad, sinister change! I am resolv'd; for if my tainted vaines Still harbour this disease, I will not need Thy anger Phylomont, to make mee bleed. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scen. 1. Enter Buonateste, Sciolto, Fredeline. Buon. Where is the honor of my Science now? Are my assertions true? I told you, though Their cold unpractis'd constitutions might For two short houres be an impediment To our fierce hopes, it could not faile to worke. Sciolt. Magnanimous Rabbin, thou hast conquer'd us, Wee yield to thy Phylosophie; I would Kneele downe for expiation of my mis-beliefe, But that my joints are old, and it were troublesome To rise agen, my fine Magicall Mounsier, Be courtly in thy Learning, embrace us, and forgive our Heresie. Buon. But are you reconcil'd (with Pious thoughts) Vnto the ancient Sages, and believe their knowledge of some use? Sciolt. They are Right Worshipfull, I rev'rence all their Ghosts; but for th'old fellow That walk'd with's Lanthorne to find honest men, Introth hee did an Ancestor of mine A private wrong, sticks in my stomack yet. Fred. My Lord, it needs must be so long agoe Your goodnesse should perswade your memorie To blot it out; but pray, what wrong could poore Diogenes afford your Ancestor? Sciolt. Why meeting him in a blind Lane, hee deny'd To lend him that Lanthorne, which you know (Signior) To a gentleman in silk Stockings, and white Shoes, was a discurtesie. Buon. Your Lordship's subtle in antiquities, And have kept a very nice Intelligence. Sciolt. Well Fredeline, this luckie Plot was ours; W'have done enough; wee now may combe Our heads, stroke 'um, strew 'um ore with Nutmegs To gratifie our braines, then lay 'um up To sleepe. Hast thou convers'd with the good Duke Since hee did feele the med'cine in his blood? Fred. O Sir, the Ice is melted that hath kept his vaines So frozen and condenc'd; hee must find out, That Nature made a woman for some use More consequent, than to converse with, and admire: Besides, this our belov'd and knotty Sophister Hath fill'd mee with such Potent arguments, Divine and Morall, to perswade the Rites Of Marriage, wise, and seemly too, as hee Shall needs consent in's reason and his will, That hee was once begotten, and must now beget. Sciolt. Th'ast drawne this Circle with my owne compasse, And rais'd a spirit in't, Agrippa's selfe, Were hee alive, could not allay. Fred. Nay more, by my appointment sir, there waits A Priest, at th'chappell dore, who just upon The nick of his conversion may appeare, And tye that mistick knot; which Eurithea, though Shee pick it with her little fingers, and Her Bodkin, hardly will unloose agen. Sciolt. Exquisite Fredeline, I heare the Doce I gave my Son, hath turn'd him from a tame Soldier to a towne Bull; I will goe seeke Him strait, and find some meanes t'appease his am'rous wrath. Exit. Fred: Phylosopher, wee two must seale a Brother-hood; Come, let mee shake thy Hebrew and thy Greeke Transcribing Fist: Not all thy Leatherne, nor Thy Vellum friends, those dead companions on Thy shelves, shall be more faithfull to thee than Thy humble Fredeline. Buon. Though my owne studies sir, Be solemne and profound, I honor a Good Wit, and can be tickled with pure Fancie Aswell as youthfull Poets in their wine. Yours I have plac'd in my first choice. Fred. Ah my Phylosopher! if thy almighty Art could doe one courtesie In my behalfe, I'ld fill thy Standish with My heart blood, e're thou shouldst want inke to write, And leave thy wisedome to the world. Buon. But name it sir: we that are rich in treasure of the mind, Like others wealthy in their gold, doe of't Preserve the best and chiefest part conceal'd. Fred. Couldst thou by some rare subtle compound worke On Nature so, that whom I lov'd, might be Inforc'd to make returne of an affection hot And violent as mine; mee thinkes I see A cheerfull answer in thy lookes, be kind, And speake some comfort e're I faint. Buon. This may be done. Fred. How, how? my sage immortall friend? Buon. You are in love? Fred. Platonically sir, no otherwaies. Buon. Fie, fie! professe a friendship, and presume To gull mee with a Ladies Paradox! Doe not I know what that imports? Fred. Well sir, you that have skill t'interpret all The Eastern tongues, may mannage my weake words Into what sense you please. Buon. If you expect redresse, the Mistris whom You love must grow familiar to my sight, That I may study her complexion, and Her yeares; then marke which way her soule's inclin'd. Fred. I know 'twill be as safe a secret in Your knowledge as in mine, 'tis Eurithea.â Buon. I thanke you much, not for the trust you put Into my brest, but for your brave ambition sir, For I affect great Spirits like great Wits: But give mee leave to aske. Fred. I will prevent you sir, for I presume You'l but demand what others privie to My bold designe have question'd twice, why I Thus toile to make Theander marry her, Since by my hopes prescrib'd for mine owne bed? Buon. You guesse my wonder to the full. Fred. My other Instruments I thought too thick And heavie soul'd, to merit knowledge of This mysterie, but you have reason sir, and shall be satisfi'd. Buon. Signior, I weare your praise as my best dignity. Fred. Pray listen then. If I should thinke t'enjoy Her by the tame and formall title of A Wife, I were but simply gull'd by my O'reweening, and too sawcie Ignorance, As knowing well my birth, my fortune, and My yeares make me unfit for such a hope; Yet it is apt shee marry too: and why? That shee may taste man, for sir, in this cold And frozen life of her virginity, There is no meanes to prosper my desires, But when shee comes to rellish Man, whose warme Contaction makes her thaw, then like a Spring Too long imprison'd in her Ice, shee'l spread Into a lib'rall streame, that ev'ry thirsty Lover may Carouse, untill his heat be quench'd. Buon. 'Tis subtly said; but Signior, now suppose The wedding past, have you no other meanes To prosecute your love? Fred. More cunning and sublime My deepe designements have contriv'd, before His bridall kisses coole upon her lips, Hee shall grow jealous of her chastitie. This sir is certaine as the nights Succession to the day, and well you know, Shee that finds her husband jealous without cause, Will lye Perdu untill shee give him one. Buon. Thy bold ambition and thy wit, indeer'd Thee first unto my thoughts, but now I find Thee deeply read in Lovers Polliticks; The lustfull Priests of Paphos might have been Disciples to thy skill. How I affect Mischiefe, when mannag'd by a braine, can lead And usher it in new untrodden waies?â Fred. But will you make this compound sir? Buon. It shall be strait prepar'd, which, e're you sleepe You must receive into your nosthrill by a fume Made on a little fire of Cassia roots; then gaze On her to morrow but two minutes space, Untill your am'rous Optick spirits by A secret transmitation steale into Her eyes, and straight the worke is crown'd. Enter Theander. Fred. I am oblieg'd to sacrifice my life: The Duke is come, away. It is not fit Your friendship should be yet begun; goe to Your Limbeck deare Phylosopher.â Exit Buon. Theand. Leisure, and drowsie sloath, did first beget These crooked and abortive thoughts: they are The progenie of ease. What doe I heere? When I had businesse in the Campe they ne're Durst tempt mee in my idlest dreames: But oh! They have o'recome my nature, and my strength! If there be remedies, Ile chuse the best. Fred. This morne your excellence was pleas'd to thinke My councels, learn'd, and requisite; I wish Your wise opinion may not change her faith; There waits a Priest within will give a sweet And sudden cure to your disease. Theand. I thanke you sir; have you acquainted Phylomont With my desire of peacefull conference? Fred. He will obay you sirâlook where hee comes. Enter Phylomont. Phyl. Sir, I am told, you wish'd mee here on some Affaire, may much concerne us both, and that Our meeting should be full of equall courtesie. Theand. Sir, I have done you wrong, and made mine eyes Severe Inquisitors to find your faults, But vayl'd them when they look'd upon mine owne: I'm growne lesse temp'rate than your selfe, something I feele, which to extenuate with civility I'ld name, unrulinesse of youth, though I Was wont to call't a Sin. Phyl. O, is it come to this? Ile cashiere my new levy'd troops. Wee'l kill no Souldiers sir, there's hope wee may beget Some now. Theander, speake? Shall wee preserve Our Ensignes folded, and proclaime a peace? Theand. My Sister you shall marry, Phylomont. Phyl. I thanke you Sir, most heartily: You, if You please, shall marry mine, and then doe with Her what you list; for Ile make bold with yours. Fred. This Duke is one of Plato's Hereticks. Theand. How e're our inward inclinations are Most sulpherous and foule, let us (I pray) Inforce a little vertue from Hypocrisie, And hide it from externall view. Phylo. Theander, I was bred under as chaste And modest Discipline as any Prince alive; And can affect a Lovers tendernesse, And decencie of speech, but not to know The order, and the course of things were fond Unmettal'd Ignorance. Is't not the custome Sir, That wee must marry first, and then to Bed? Theand. To Bed, that is to sleepe. Phyl. Right, if the Bridegroome Sir be mad, sleepe is His Med'cine then; I'm sober, I thanke heaven, And know my businesse, your Sister shall find it. Theand. All this is newes to mee, either thou knowst Too much, or I have thought a virtue what More pregnant men, may terme a dull mistake; It cannot be, I have a strange instinct That gives mee pleasure in my former faith. Phyl. Injoy it still, your life and motion sir, You can preserve by immateriall fire, Wee that are forc'd to keepe our spirits warme In flesh and blood, must be content to live As other mortals doe. Theand. I prethee let's dispute it bashfully; Yet I would learne, is custome growne so bold? First marry Phylomont, and strait to bed! Phyl. To bed, that's as you said to sleepe; and then 'Tween sleepe and waking sir, to touch, as twere By chance, not purpose, and so fall into You guesse the rest. Thean. Enough, Ile heare no more. Phyl. But where's your Sister? I would faine dispatch. Theand. Conduct him to her, Fredeline; this Key Will open you the way, if I shall need Her pardon to excuse m'unskilfulnesse, Intreat it for mee sir. Phyl. It shall be easily attain'd. Fred. This is a service I have much desir'd to do your excellence. Phyl. Signior, you have deserv'd my thanks. Exeunt. Phyl. Fred. Theand. This noble youth was by the generall voice Held most exact and heavenly in the whole Demeanor of his life, his judgment is Of late defil'd, or what I feele is no Rebellion of my reason, but my strength, Not a disease, but some odd sawcinesse Enter Eurithea vayl'd. Of health, which hee doth merrily commend. Behold my faire Cathusian now appeares, Whose purer thoughts and beauty soone will turne This new opinion to an heresie. Eurith. I was perswaded sir, thus vayl'd, to wait On your commands. Thean. Tis now (sweet Eurithea) in thy power To shew a mercie that may save my life. Slaves that are chain'd unto the heavie Oare, Who labour till they chafe the restlesse waves Into a foame, are not inthrall'd like mee. Eurith. Can you believe my Lord, your griefes are so Contracted to your selfe, so slow and lame With their sad weight that in this tedious space They nere could travell to my heart? Know they have made a visit here, here they Are lodg'd; and I could wish (though strangers much Vnwelcom'd at the first) they never would Returne from whence they come. Theand. Thou art too pittifull: but be so still, That I may flatter my oppressions with Some hope, if not with remedy, grant a Request which I unwillingly must urge, And thou shalt faintly heare. Eurith. Why doe I languish with delaies? call't not (Theander) a request, but a command, And justly confident reveale it strait. Thean. O that we could Exchange intelligence with our dumbe thoughts, And make our meaning knowne e're it should need The tongue! I cannot, dare not nam't. Eurith. You wrong th'umblemish'd vertue of your soule, Your contemplation never could create A businesse so deform'd, as not deserves To be deliver'd by your voice, I sigh, And mourne untill I heare't. Theand. If I must speake, I would some Northern frost That purifies the morn's infected mists, would purge My breath, e're it arrive unto thine eare. Poore Eurithea, you must marrie mee. Eurith. Is't this, that so hath vex'd your utterance? More willingly than I would leave the black And sootie Caves, where Fiends reside, to walke I'th fragrant dwellings of the blest: Lead on, Be cheerfull, and recall your health, your owne Domestick Priest, with ceremonious Rites Will quickly perfit your desire.â Theand. So willingly I stay Eurithea, can you guesse th'intent Of what you would performe, of many new And undiscover'd trials you shall make Of things, we had not courage yet to learne; Darke deeds, and practis'd in the night, which when Our hastie youth shall aske our wisdome leave, May seeme perhaps convenient, but not good. Eurith. Why should I make my meditation judge Of what your better knowledge hath resolv'd? Thus I unvayle, to tell the world I dare I'th open interview of light, approve And justifie your worst and secret thoughts. Theander, lead the way. Theand. O cruell stars! I shall betray a Virgin now, whose innocence Is so extreame, it yields, and turnes to guilt! Eurith. Why doe you stay my Lord, and strive to make, Or find new sorrowes, e're the old are lost. Theand. Leave mee my gentle Love; I will not goe, Nor tell the cause: Would thou wer't wicked as My selfe awhile, that thou might'st know't: my eyes Grow sick; 'tis not secure to weare Thy beauties thus display'd. Eurith. Alas, these are but couz'ning formes, there is No truth in your delayes; I know you spoke In the sincerenesse of your soule, when you Profess'd our marriage would assist your minds Recoverie. Theander, come. Theand. Dull Fate! where is the vigour that I show'd When our lowd Cannon seem'd to stifle the Affrighted day with smoke, and Rivers slow'd Themselves into a new extent, swelling Their tides with humane blood? In Lovers soft And simple war, I'm weaker than a child. Eurith. Still more delayes! you kill mee if you stay. Theand. Shee is resolv'd, her better Angell sure Is ever by her side, no danger then Can harbour where shee goes, and yet I blush As I should need her vayle to hide my shame E're I commit the Sinâlead you the way. Eurith. This is a strange command! here, follow sir. Theand. Thou little, though imperious God of love, (Warmely inthron'd within thy mothers lap,) How wilt thou sit and smile when thou shalt see To sooth thy wantonnesse, and swell thy pride, The Bridegroome woo'd, and usher'd by the Bride? Exeunt. Enter Gridonell, Castraganio, Arnoldo, Iaspero. Grid. I will not follow a Platonick Duke, So tell him sir, I am inspir'd, and know The meaning of the word. Castra. Be not so furious sir, I'm of your Sect, Vnlesse hee suddenly recant, I am Resolv'd sooner to serve the great Turke. Grid. The Turke! Is hee Platonically given? Castra. Troth sir, not much; hee hath some seven hundred Of those taff'tie creatures you admire so, in's owne house. Grid. Would I were the great Turke But for one Month; yet 'tis a chargeable place, Hee cann't spend lesse than a Corronels pay In Pins among these Damsels, besides Muffes, And fine white Gloves! Poore Gentleman, hee lives At a great rate. Castraganio, a wordâ takes him aside. Castr. Be not so boisterous sir, the Powder workes strangely. Grid. Fetch mee your Sister hither strait. Castr. But for what purpose? Grid. What's that to you. I've occasion to use her. Something I must doe, I know not what 'tis, But I begin to feele shee will be very Convenient for mee at this time. Castr. If you'l agree upon the wedding houre. Grid. How long then must I stay? Castra. Till a License be brought from Palermo, And the Priest have done his office. Grid. I have not patience to expect till then, Goe bring her hither strait; dispatch, Or Ile weare out my Fist upon your smooth countenance. Castr. You are too rude, I'le leave you sir. Exit. Grid. Deny mee such a poore request? 'tis an Ill natur'd Rogue! Come hither Iaspero, have you a Sister? Iasp. Yes, and a pretty one, I thanke my Stars. Grid. Fetch her to mee instantly, I cannot stay. Iasp. You must have patience till her Nurse have made Her ready sir. Grid. Her Nurse, what does shee with a Nurse? Iasp. Shee is at suck, and hardly six monthes old. Grid. At suck! nay, if shee lye at that poore Ward, Tipling of milke, shee is not for my turne. Arnoldo? prethee fetch mee thine. Arnol. I would be glad to doe my friend a courtesie. Would you had spoke in time, for sir, introth shee's dead. Grid. I doe not like a dead commoditie. Well Gentlemen, you must each stand Sentinell Close at the Laundry dore, and bring mee the First prize; no words, it must be done. Arnol. Gladly, wee love th'imployment sir. Iasp. This Soldier has din'd with the devill lately, And fed on Sea-coale Cakes, hee's vildly alter'd.â Ex. Iasp. Arnol. Grid. I'm wondrous hot within; my guts are dry'd To a bundle of match: and I breath Gunpowder. What have I done of late, where have I bin? Let me consider it.â Enter Sciolto. Sciolt. Hah! Melancholly, Son; thy Corporall would Looke merrier when hee see's his Feather worne I'th Enemies hat, and's Knapsack without bread, Tell mee, what do'st thou want? Grid. Something that you may helpe mee to; you sir Are old, and well experienc'd in the world. Sciolt. And thou shalt have it then: tell mee, what is't? Grid. Why sir, a wench. Sciol. How boy! make me your pimp! Doe not vex mee, you shall know I could fight in my Youth. Grid. I sir, any man will fight for a wench. Sciolt. You will provoke mee, get you in, and give Attendance to Theanders marriage rites, tis strait to be perform'd. Grid. Alas, I dare not goe; there is a cause not fit to be told. Sciolt. You know what's fit! y'had best to tell it me. Speake, what's the cause you dare not goe? Grid. Sir, I should ravish the Bride. Sciolt. Are you so eager bent? Rare Phylosopher! Grid. If I but see a Priest, and a Maid by, Though her dowrie be but a Silver Thimble, And a skein of Silke, I shall beat him sir, Vnlesse hee doe his office strait, and marrie us. Sciolt. Hah! Tis high time to weare mine eyes open. Hee may chance in this mad fit, contract himselfe To some Inheretrix that's landed on The High-way, whose Father sels fine Crab-sticks, And hazle Nuts to riding Citizens. Come Son, this Key must lock you up; you shall Remaine a Prisoner in my Chamber till you grow more tame. Grid. Ile not be taken Prisoner sir, by any man alive. Sciolt. Nor yet obay your Father, you: you'l not Inforce mee draw my Sword? Grid. No sir, you had not best. Sciolt. D'you threaten boy! not best to draw my sword? Grid. No sir, for feare you spraine your arme: these weake Old fellowes know not what's good for 'um. Scio. Sirra go in, one disobedient word, &amp; I will dis-inherit thee. Grid. My Lord, Ile yield, but if you would but lock Faire Amadine a prisoner i'th same roome. Sciolt. Thou traitor, get thee in. Grid. Perhaps she would be willing sir. Sciol. Go in I say. Ex. Enter Phylomont, and Ariola. Phyl. Let mee a while containe thee in mine armes (Belov'd Ariola) the force of Indian winds That shake the aged Cedar from his root Shall not divide us now. Ariol. Here I would stay (My valiant Phylomont) till death should wave His dart, and becken us to follow him Vnto the hidden shades, till hee should make By angry power these kind embraces cold. Phyl. How sad and dismall sound the farewels which Poore Lovers take, whom destiny dis-joynes, Although they know their absence will be short? And when they meet agen, how musicall And sweet, are all the mutuall joyes they breath? Ariol. Like Birds, who when they see the wearie Sun Forsake the world, they lay Their little Pensive heads beneath their wings, To ease that weight which his departure adds unto their griefe. Phyl. 'Tis true my love: but when They see that bright perpetuall traveller Returne, they warme and aire their Feathers at His beames, and sing untill their gratitude Hath made them hoarse. Ariol. My Brother I request may be forgiven, and call not my Restraint his cruelty, t'hath mended me Within, and fill'd mee with such bless'd designes, As will deserve your wonder and your thanks. Forgive him, Phylomont. Phyl. Our friendship is Restor'd, which thus I will confirme with vowes Vpon thy sacred hand, but surely it Were better ratifi'd upon thy baulmie lip, Which after absence, decent custome will, Allow to those, who are delighted when they meet. Ariol. Your virtues have such great and safe Authority, they cannot aske what's fit to be deny'dâ he kisses her. Phyl. This seemes (me thinks) a new Demeanor shee is alter'd much, more free And kind than shee was wont. Ariol. Why dost thou ruminate aside, as if Thy Meditation were too guilty, or too great to be reveal'd? Phyl. Give mee (thou precious darling of my heart) The privilege to doubt a little, and Resolve me strait; why are thy courtesies So great now, and easily attain'd, Which heretofore thou didst deprive mee of With frownes, and strict behaviour of thy brow? Ariol. It shall be ever thus, my passion, and My thoughts are chang'd, as Eurithea with My Brother lives, so shall our conversation take All liberty, and our salutes be far More amorous and bold, though vertuous still. Phyl. This bounty had been excellent, when you Had privilege to give, or to deny; but now Your charter's out of date, and mine Begins to rule: the Priest attends below To celebrate our Nuptiall rites, which is The happy houre that doth advance The husbands government; come, to the Chappell, Love. Ariol. A little pawse; what need wee marry sir? I lately was instructed to A clearer choice of our felicitie: is it not better to live thus, in a Perfection that wee know, than to attempt New joyes, which our unskilfulnesse should Make us doubt? this is the Angels life; My Brother told me so, and then hee breath'd Such holy Lectures as have prosper'd much upon my soule. Phyl. Not marry (my Ariola?) is that the fatall word? Take heed how you are sooth'd into a strange, and fond beliefe. Ariol. Your caution (sir) is onely needfull to Your selfe, can you desire a blessing more Exact than this wee may possesse, to live In everlasting confidence of what Wee doe, yet still embrace, and love, although In persons not conjoyn'd, united in our soules? Phyl. These are but triviall documents, alas! I'm hardly taught, thus rashly to renounce What all the wiser world have taken so Long leisure to aprove; besides, Ariola, You much mistake your Brother, for just now I saw him married, the deeds past, these hands Gave, and presented him to Hymens use, And hee's preparing for my Sisters bed. Ariol. Your Sisters bed! (gentle my Lord) beware How you confer a callumnie, which all Your Orizons and mine, to helpe them cann't excuse to heaven. Phyl. Let mee conduct you to him, and your eyes Shall witnesse my assertion for a truth. Ariol. No sir, if hee be guilty growne, I shall Now wish to see him so; can hee recant Thus soone, the faire religion hee did preach With all the fervencie of mind? Phyl. Do not lament, Th'example you should rather follow, than Accuse: come, my Ariola, like him Wee'l marry too, our wisdome shall perswade us to't. Ariol. Some wicked spirit strives sir, to betray Vs both: make triall of this new Vnusuall happinesse a while, live, and Converse beneath the spreading poplar for Our shade, and for variety wee'l sit On yonder Rivers flowry bankes. Phyl. There whisper till wee court him to delay His journey to the Sea, and swell, untill Hee leave his scalie deafe inhabitants Vpon the Shore, as tribute to our Loves. Ariol. I, Phylomont, these are the guiltlesse sports. Phyl. Fine holy dreames indeed, but cannot last, You and I must marry, 'tis resolv'd. Ariol. Banish that thought, or I will take my leave, And be estrang'd for ever from thy sight. But when reclaim'd, seeke mee i'th mirtle Grove. Phyl. Stay, faire Ariola, my reason sure must laugh At this subjection of my faith, but I Will on, fredome and kind addresses shee Hath still assur'd; come, follow mee, like an Vnwilling Proselyte, I slowly move To try the pleasures of Platonick Love. Exeunt. Enter Amadine, Fredeline with a Paper, and Castraganio. Amad. Dispatch sir, it growes late, my Lady will Expect I wait on her to bed, th'intelligence I bring is still of certainty and truth. Make your advantage of't with your best skill. Fred. Wilt thou adventure Amadine, 'tis but (At worst) the forfeiture of thy poore service, Which ile requite, with giving thee young Gridonell To be thy husband, and to rule; my plots Have so design'd, why did I order't else That hee should take the Med'cine which hath forc'd Him to such FÅminine attempts? Amad. Indeed hee's growne more bold with mee of late, And will come fairely on in time. Fred. O doubt it not, can my experienc'd head study in vaine? Captaine, my indeer'd friend, will you forsake Mee now, when such a ripe occasion showes It selfe, to give successe unto my hopes? Your sister is content to hazard all. Castra. Tis full of danger sir. Fred. I will be there my selfe, and stand between Your person and his vvrath. Castr. 'Tis certaine losse sir, of my company. Fred. How? what's a company that brings as fraile Revenew, and uncertaine, as our purchases At dice, who'd live, and be maintain'd by others deaths? Looke here, just now I caus'd him signe this grant, The Provostship of Necosia newly voyd, Which being under's hand and seale confirm'd, No new relapse of favour can recall The gift. You see your name here sir carv'd out In Roman Characters; the feat but done, Ile put it in your hand, then strait you may Take horse, ride post unto your government, Your Sister with you, on some Parsons strong Tall double Gelding sir, kept in my stable for That use; and then laugh at your Patron till he sicken at your mirth. Amad. But shall my husband Elect follow us? Fred. And ride as swiftly as a Scythian from a battell lost. Amad. In my weak judgement Brother, our rewards are faire, I am resolv'd to venture it. Castr. Early i'th morning sir? Fred. Iust at the first appearance of the light. The dore I told you of, must be the place. Castra. You will be there protected with your sword? Fred. A Captaine, and raise doubts, that sound like feares! Come sir, all shall be safe. You to your Lady. Let's meet i'th upper lobby two houres hence, And there consult. My Chymick fume I have Already t'ane, if that succeed, and this Plot thrive, I will require no more from my Vncertaine Fate, nor Art, whose usuall scope, Is but to pay learn'd industry with hope. Exeunt. Enter Theander, Eurithea, a Table, stooles, and lights set out. Theand. Husband, and Wife, wee have a calling now; Shewes it not strange, disquieting thy tender eares With sounds th'are unacquainted with? Titles (Mee thinks) that yet wee know not how to weare, Wee should be taught behaviour, and some formes Of gravity, are they not usefull, Eurithea? Eurith. My Lord, I am more ignorant than you. If wee have ventur'd upon errours, wee'l Conceale them, and forgive our selves. Theand. Her beauty kindles in my brest new fires, Before the old are quench'd; wise Fredeline Told mee, our marriage would procure my remedie, Alas! the cure's to come, and now I must Require't as custome, or a duty from her; In my nice thoughts 'twill teach her impudence. O curs'd disease! What shall I doe? Eurith. Theander, you are still perplex'd, I thought The holy Priest had a Mysterious power To make these troubles cease. Did you not vow Our Nuptials was the meanes to save your life? Theand. To Bed, my Eurithea, it is late. They say the married paire are incident To cares, tis fit then they should sleepe, prethee To bed; shall I goe call thy woman? Eurith. My Lord, you are not kind: the tedious houres I could contract to Minutes in your company, And waste them faster than our village girles That dance in Meadows all the Month of May. Ile take my leave, yet boldly too, Withall the solemne sweetnesse of a Brideâ Kisses My Lord, good-night. Theand. I am inflam'd agen; did she not take her leave, and say Good-night? Then whither must I goe? One bed I thought kind Hymen had allow'd To both, since by his God-head wee are made But one; thus it is gen'rally receiv'd: stay Eurithea, wee must talk. Enter Amadine. Amad. Madam, your Bed's prepar'd, shall I undresse Your Ladiship, or the Bridegroome first? I'th Province where I liv'd, wee us'd to call A dozen apron Squires t'uncloath the husband, Then sow him in a Sheet, and lay him on his Pillow Tamely, to expect the Bride two houres before shee came. Eurith. Wench, thou art mad! D'you understand her sir? Theand. A little, Eurithea, doe not you? Eurith. Shee talkes as it were fit wee two. Amad. Should lye together, that's my meaning Madam. Eurith. Hence, and leave us, immodest foole. Amad. I knew t'would come to thisâFredeline will Find my words true; the morning may perhaps Make yee both Melancholly. Exit. Eurith. This wench, Theander, hath been fam'd for wit; I doubt shee hath experience too, in things Not decent for th'observance of a Mayd. Theand. Alas, shee talkes but what she heares, and in Her understanding seemes proper and fit! Eurith. That we should sleepe together in one bed. Theand. Indeed it sounds most strangely to us yet, But use will dull those scruples to the eare; It must be done, custome will be obay'd. Eurith. Never by us. We'le live to be examples. Not sir to follow those, we cannot like. Theand. Consider gentle Love, ere you believe Your owne opinions best. Why did we marry? Eurith. That's easily resolv'd, I thought Theander, Some wild sad jealousie had vex'd thy heart With feare of rivallship, and by this sacred band Thou would'st secure and tie me to thy selfe, More safely to destroy anothers hope, Though these were needlesse doubts I never gave You cause to hold my love in your suspect. Theand. Thou dost mistake my griefes, it hath a cause More soule, which I'ld aquaint thee with, if it Were comely to reveale't, but since I have Betray'd and led thy guiltlesse feet into This sacred share, 'tis fit t'avoid the scornes Which singularity, and overbashfull Nicenesse will beget; we'le live as others doe, As much i'th practises of night, as day. Eurith. O Theander! the sweetnesse of thy soule Is sowr'd, like Cretan wines that are too excellent To last; my blood thou hast to water turn'd, And I shall soone consume it all in teares. Theand. Goe Eurithea to thy bed, sleepe like A Virgin not a wife, be by thy owne Embraces warm'd, Injoy thy bosome to Thy selfe, away! hast to thy bed, I to My grave, and let my Coffin lye Vngarnish'd in the earth, come not to strew It o're with flowres: I am so pestilent That I should blast thee after death. Eurith. Theander stay! Who knowes but heaven may give Such mighty blessings to my speech, that straite I may perswade thee from thy guilty thoughts? Theand. Never: my breast is now become The burning prison of the fiends, it is So sulpherous and hot, me thinkes they find Their punishment increasde, and would to coole Themselves, returne vnto their former hell. Eurith. O direfull extacie! can I heare this and live? Theand. Ile tell thee more, to make thee fly With some kind Angels borrow'd wings, from this Infected Region where I breath. Know all Our marriage vowes (which certainely were first Ordain'd for holy use) I meerely tooke, As formall helpes to my pernicious lust. Eurith. Yet stay, in this short tyranny of Time, Thou canst not be so sinfull growne, as to despise My pitty and my praiers too! ? stay. Thean. I dare not, for thine eyes augment my smart, Each small neglected beame they shed, I gather up in flames, and quite pervert Their vertuous influence to a lustfull fire. Eurith. Thou lost remainder of the noblest Prince, The active Warre, or wiser Courts e're knew, How doe I blush to find my groanes and sighes Have left me breath enough to speake my last Farewell? Thean. How farre is it to heaven, that yet This Ladyes mournings are not heard, for if They were, my sufferings and my guilt would cease; Or cannot our petitions climbe, and get Accesse as nimbly as our faults? O this Is it that so emboldens vex'd humanity, Makes us complaine, those undiscern'd Immortall governors are often in Their bounty slow, in Iustice too severe, And give not what we beg, but what we feare. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scen. 1. Enter Theander, Fredeline. Theand. My gladnesse doth ore come me Fredeline, Some kind celestiall power hath phisick'd me With Immateriall baulme, the sickenesse of My bloud is gone, my hot and eager thoughts Grow temp'rat now, my vaines are coole within, As silver pipes replenish'd from a spring. Fred. It seemes the Philophers Doce hath done Working, 'tis well he is already married? Theand. O I am light, more nimble then a Dove, Or empty Eagles in their mornings slight; Me thinkes this sinfull vestment of my flesh Showes cleane and new upon my soule, now I Shall sleepe agen, and have such guiltlesse dreames, As I may tell my Mother when I wake. Fred. 'Tis strange the operation should decay So soone; some few howres hence my subtile Fume Will governe in mine Eies: and there I hope Continue longer then his Lust hath done with him. Theand. I'm thinking Fredeline how Eurithea will Rejoyce, when she shall finde what mastery Her holy friends above have wrought in my behalfe. Fred. 'Tis now neere birth of day, and as I told You sir, to finde her pensive in her bed, To draw her curtaines, and reveale your selfe Quite alter'd and recover'd in your minde, Will by the sudden wonder much augment Her joy. Thean. It must be full of pleasure, show the way. Fred. That's her Chamber sir, but through a backe doore (Vnlesse her carefull woman hinder us By a strong bolt) I can convey you to her without noyse; Make me your guide, and move to your right hand. Theand. I shall be welcom'd and admir'd, as I Had made my visit from a Region so Remote, that my returne would be no more Believ'd, then from the graveâ Fred. Here I injoyn'd my Captaine and his sister stand conceal'd. If he should proove too cowardly for such A guilt, I were undoneâSure that's his voice. Enter Castraganio (in a night gown unready) &amp; Amadine. Castr. They both are come, speake lowder Amadine, He cannot heare us else. Thean. Hah! who are these? Fred. They come from Euritheas Chamber, sir, Lets retire to the Arras, and listen to their talkeâ Amad. Brother take heede how you discourse And boast of your accesse, Theander would Goe neere to kill us both, if he but knew Of this nights revelling. Castra. Dost thinke I weare my tongue so slipp'ry in My mouth, these are not pleasures fit to be Reveald: away, w'have said enough?â Ex. Castra. &amp; Amad. Fred. They have observ'd the language I prescrib'd, To the strictnesse of a sillable. Theand. Sure he did urge my name: and spoke as it Concern'd my Iustice to destroy em both. Who are they, thou knowst em Fredeline? Fred. My indeer'd friend: can you be guilty of Such close night exercise? Theand. Who is thy friend? death on thy courteous feares? Why dost conceale't so long? What is he call'd? Fred. Were he my brother, and thus iniur'd you, My secrecie should never make him safe. 'Tis Castraganeo and his sister Amadine, She that attends upon your wife. Theand. My wife: that title's new, and will grow horrid now! Her Chamber was their Sphere of revelling: They came from thence. Fred. Can you thinke so, my Lord? Theand. Why dost thou strive to lessen my beliefe, With wearing such disguises on thine owne? Thou saw'st they came from thence. Fred. Sir, if they did, that can inferre no cause, To make your reason so disquieted; Are there not many of these Tiffany Young kerchiefe people that will have their lovers in Their Ladies Chamber whilst shee sleepes? Theand. Her Lover Fredeline! thou wouldst beguile My Iealousie with hopes impossible: It is her brother, thinke on that. Fred. Can Incest seeme so strange to your conceit? The sooner sir, for by that meanes th'are sure T'increase th'alliance, of those children which They get, and make them more a kinne unto themselues; But if the gentle Eurithea you Suspect (as be it farre from my dull thoughts To raise a sawcy feare) let me kill himâ Theand. Goe, follow straite: bring me his heart, that I May see it pant and bleed within my hand. Kill him, his sister too. Yet stay, stay Fredeline: 'Tis not the custome of my soule, to be Reveng'd by Deputie, or fix my anger where There is not equall strength and valour to incounter it. Fred. But sir, if he should live To prattle in his Wine, and boast what he hath done? Theand. Goe then, take care thou see him strait Imbarqu'd, And let some cunning Pilote steere him to A coast so wild and distant from this Clime, That's language never may be understood: Not to secure my fame, but in a piteous tendernesse To Euritheas Sex. False Eurithea! When I had purg'd my memory of all My raw unwholesome thoughts, couldst thou defile't Agen with acting what I but unwillingly desir'd? Fred. 'Tis worth my poore vexation too, When I consider how the scornefull, that Malign'd the pure cÃ¦lestiall sect of Lovers, which you mutually conspir'd To raise, will smile when they shall heare of this, And say, 'twas but an old Platonick trick. Theand. Leave me, and see him suddenly imbarqu'd. Fred. Sir, your command shall be obey'd; but I Beseech you not proceed to danger, on These weake unlucky doubts. Theand. This was the cause she did disswade me from Her bed, that she might make another roome, Most virgin-like pretending 'twas a crime to aske A husbands priviledge: prethee leave me. Fred. I dare not yet my noble injur'd Prince. Exeunt. Enter Castraganio, and Amadine. Cast. I'm glad the danger's past: It had beene hard To teach me venture it, but that the Provostship Was a most powerfull baite. Ama. And then to make the rich yong Gridonel my husband too, For all his plotts are sure. Cast. But that which perfected My confidence, was thy assurance of The Ladye's easie inclination to Forgive; for as thou told'st me, if the worst Succeed, and we should be constrain'd to tell The truth, she'le pitty young beginners, that Are forc'd to hazard a little honesty To make em rich, and is able to Procure Theanders pardon as her owne. Amad. You may presume it and rejoyce, for I Have felt her breast; 'tis soft and tender as a Pellicans.â Enter Fredeline, with a Parchment writing, and Pocket Inckhorne. Fred. My noble Captaine, and my precious friend, I will not name what lasting gratitude, Your cares and courage have oblieg'd me to: Men that are hearty and sincere come late With promises, and earely with their deedes. Cast. I hope sir, though our dialogue were short, We utter'd your meaning in your owne words. Amad. My voice was valiant too, and lowd enough. Fred. All was exacter then my hopes desir'd: And now (just dealing sir doth strengthen love) There is the Patent for your Provostship. Pray put it in your pocket safe, make choice Of all my Horses, straite to hasten you Vnto your government. Amad. And shal my husband follow us? Fred. Iust now, he's drawing on his bootes, hee'le ride Halfe naked with his leggs, for out of hast, He hath forgot to put his stockings on. Amad. Were he quite nak'd, he should be welcome, sir. Fred. Friend, I implore I may by ev'ry Post Have letters of thy businesse, and thy health; And pretty Amadine when you have children, (As heaven no doubt, will send you store) pray keepe Them warme, and let em eate no fruit, nor fish; You goe unto a cold raw clime, and I Desire all your posteritie might thrive. Amad. It is the kindest gentleman. Fred. Wee'le meete i'th stable straite, there have A parting teare or two, and so farewell. Mischiefe on my fraile memory. I had Forgot a written Scedule here, to which drawes out a paper Pen and Inke. I must intreat your handsâ Cast. How! what is it sir? Fred. Onely a short certificate, that justifies You lay with Eurithea sir, and Amadine Must needs subscribe, as witnesse that she saw you in her bed. Cast. You shall excuse me. Fred. Can you deny me this? Amad. What w'have already done can raise but his Suspitions, this will make him mad. Fred. Speake, will you write? Castra. Our other crime if it be found may be Forgiven, but once consent to this, hee'le grow Too wise sir, to be mercifull. Fred. Well, I must seeke for friendship among beasts, There is no melting courtesie, no honesty In men. Determine straite, will ye subscribe? Castr. You have our answer, Signior, pray receive't. Fred. Deare friend I take my leave. Sweet Amadine Farewell. I'm sorry we must part, as blind Men doe, never to see each other more. Castr. Believe not so vnkindly of our destinies. Fred. Never, I feare: for I suspecting youl'd deny This small request, was faine to hire Two shaggy ill-look'd Gentlemen, a brace Of massie hilted rogues, who waite below To cut your throats. Cast. Y'are not in earnest sir. Fred. Deare friend, when did you find I was in jeast. However if you'le fixe your names in writing here, You may goe on with safety to your government; Shall they come up? Amad. No, no sir, if they be rogues, And have such shaggy lookes: Brother, I finde He's mischievous. Cast. Give me the paper sirâ He writes, and gives it Amadine. Fred. Gentle Mistresse, your name tooâ So, now ye are kind, let me embrace you both. And pray looke on the Pattent sir, I gave You to assure the Provostship.â Castra takes it out and opens it. Castr. Hah! here wants the Dukes hand. Fred. Right: to what purpose pray should it be there, When th'office is not falne. Castr. I'm gull'd, led by the nosthrill like an Asse. Amad. Nor shall I have no husband, Signior? Fred. Introth I have beene busied much of late, And never spoke unto the Gentleman; Besides, I thought y'had beene inclin'd to the Platonicke way. Amad. I would my nayles were long enough, villaine, I'ld flev thee into raggs. Fred. Alas, I smile at Injuries. Castr. Peace, doe not anger him: come sister wee'le Vnto my Garrison. I've a Commission for A Company, I hope you'le speake unto The Duke I may injoy't. I'm sure his hand is to't. Fred. But yet you'le find a willing small Mistake too in that grant; the Captaine is Not dead that had the place. Castr. Would I had spirit but to beate my selfe. Fred. You are a Florentine; one of the subtle Tribe, That thinke your neighbours have no braines, but what They meete serv'd in with sage and vinegar, To a calfes head: I pray believe you found A dull Sicilian once, that could out-wit a Tuscan Gentleman. Castr. Y'are master of your pleasure sir; whither shall we go? Fred. You must to Sea. Amad. To sea, Ile drown here first. Or aske pardon, and confesse all. Fred. Not one word more on forfeiture of life. Castr. My wonder makes me dumbe, I need no threats. Fred. You shall to the Bermudoes friend, and there Plant Cotton whilst your Sister learnes to spinne: It is the Dukes command, and till I can Provide a Ship, I must inclose you in A garret safe, where you may weepe and meditate. No howling now, nor crying lowd, for feare My ill-fac'd blades below ore heare't, and strait To quallifie your voyces cut your throats; Nor doe not grumble curses out, I hold Them much unwholsome in a morning ere I breake my fast.â Ex. Enter Phylomont, Buonateste, Ariola. Phyl. I'm weary of this cold Platonick life: D'you thinke that Ile sit sighing thus (Ariola) Vnder a Poplar tree, or whining by A River side, like a poore Fisherman That had lost his Net? Either consent to marry, Or I will strait take horse, ride to my Province And seeke some downe right virgin out, that knowes Natures plaine lawes, though not the Art of love. Ariol. Can you complaine I am unkinde, or the Sweet freedome which I give, is not so much As eithers vertue might allow? Phyl. It is enough! Men that are satisfy'd With winde and ayre, may keepe Camelions company: I'm of an other diet; I, my learned New acquaintance here, laughes to conceive What Hercules and's 50 Mistresses Would have thought of a Platonick lover. Buon. He would have beaten's braines out with his Clubb. Phyl. Will you consent to marry, speake? Ariol. If I am powerfull with thee Phylomont, Let me but woe thee to the Woods agen, And try how my perswasions can subdue Thy minde, unto our former temp'rat love. Phyl. No I thanke heaven; I'le sooner goe thither To rob poore Squirrels of their nuts, my sage, And learned Author, shall I humble you So much as to goe bid my followers Prepare for my departure hence. Buon. Stay a little sir, the Lady may relent. Phylo. My hopes grow cold. I'le instantly away. Ariol. Stay Phylomont: I doe command thee stay, By the religion of thy sacred vowes. Phylo. One houre I will; upon condition too, You walke aside with my Philosopher, And listen reverently to his advice. Ariol. My reason's fortify'd, let him come in, Phylo. A way, use all the force of your capacitie. Buon. Plato shall lose one fond disciple sir, Or I'le goe burne my bookes, and sindge my beard Off in the flame.â Exeunt. Enter Theander, and Eurithea, at severall doores. Theand. In this course Pilgrimes weed, I shall injoy That quietnesse, which though great Princes have The power oft to preserve in others, yet Can ne're command unto themselves. Eurith. Alas, my Lord, what have I done, That you should leave me to suspect My Innocence? Why, will you thus become A holy wanderer to seeke that happinesse In other Lands, which here you scornefully Forsake? What have I done? Theand. Is thy offence Growne up to be thy glory now, dost love To heare it told? or art thou sooth'd with silly hope It is conceald, the Starres are witnesses; They all grew weary of the night, and wish'd For clowdes to hide their radient eyes, from what Vnwillingly they saw? Eurith. Ease my amazement quickly, or I dye. Theand. Thou Eurithea, and the world are growne Too false and subtile, for the easie dull Sincerenesse of my heart, I will retyre To Desarts and to Rocks, there feed the winds With my continuall sighes: untill I raise A storme shall nightly shake this Pallace towres, And give thy flattr'ing conscience cause to feare, Though I am gone still my revenge dwells here. Exit. Eurith. O I would follow, but my griefes are growne So burdensome, they bow me to the ground. She fals. How various are the changes of our fate, Now must I lose him, when he's safe restor'd To all his chaste and noble thoughts: which way Could I consent to an offence? I am By some conspiracie betray'd. Enter Fredeline. Fred. This fellow and his sister must be sent To Sea with speed, for feare some watchfull accident Discover all, Eurithea! the most Illustrious Princesse of this Isle: looke up Faire Virgin-wife; alas, why doe you weepe? Eurith. I am forsaken, lost! Theander is Vnkind, o'recome with jealousie and scorne. Fred. Madame, I thinke, I partly know the cause, Believ't, there are more villaines in the world, Then will appeare so in the face, though it Be wash'd, and shav'd, then view'd with open lights. Eurith. But sir, know you what thus disturbs my Lord? Fred. Your Woman's false: her brother such a knave As were he sent to hell, the Fiends would crowd Together in a nooke, t'avoid his company. Eurith. She and her brother false to me! Fred. Rise up, I doe beseech your Excellence; And having wip'd away those liquid pearles From of your beuteous eyes, read this and wonder.â She rises &amp; takes a paper from him. Eurith. O dismall! horrid treacheryâ Fred. There you perceive, he doth affirme, he did Injoy your bed, and Amadine subscribes To witnesse what he certifies. Eurith. Though they are cruell, I forgive them both. Fred. That's heavenly said: yet marke their impudence, This note they sent to me, t'intreat me give It to the Duke, but when I doe, Let the quotidian gowt cease on my hands, Vntill my fingers grow more knotty then a Maple roote. Eurith. Sir, I believe you'le strive Rather to lessen his suspition, than By new contrivements give it growth. Fred. D'you thinke I am of humane race? this roome Is much too publicke for your miseries. I pray retyre within, and wee'le consult, How to dispell all these inchanted clowdes. Eurith. You are become the treasure of my hope, And will obliege me when my fortune smiles Agen, unto a gratitude, that shall Be great, and suffer no decay. Fred. Already she is very kind, I hope My fume begins to worke, I'le gaze upon Her still untill mine eyes melt into hers. Exeunt. Enter Iaspero, Gridonell, Arnoldo. Iasp. Your Father sent us to release you sir, You have the house at liberty agen, He sayes, he may trust you with women now, For there is such a blemish found in one Of the fairest of the sex, as he presumes, Will teach all men to fly their company. Grid. Indeed my danger towards women's past. For whether't be with fasting out My supper twice, or walking gently in My shirt, whilst the Moone shin'd, I cannot tell, But I am strangely alter'd, growne so cold Within, as I had layne a whole night perdu O'top o'th Alpes Arnol. But you were very hot before? Grido. O Arnoldo, thou maist be glad thy sister Was dead, I had so maul'd her else. Iasp. 'Twas happy mine was at sucke too. Grido. Th'art in the right; for had she beene but old Enough to weare a bondgrace on her brow, And nibble Gingerbread, sh'ad serv'd my turne. Arnold. 'Twas a miraculous feaver you was in. Grido. Well, shall I tell you gentlemen, believ't, I had eaten some strange odd meat, the pickled kidney of A Goate, or the rumpe of a devill broyld. But have you heard of a faire Lady that had got a blemish? Iasp. Our brave new Dutchesse sir, sh'ath troubled all The house, and in her very bridall night They say, playd the Adultresse. Grid. How, gentlemen? Pray heare me speake; I've judgement in these things. I will be hang'd, if sh'ath not dipp'd her finger In a French pie, some kickshaw made of severall Strange bits. Iust such as I encountred with, And there devour'd the kidney of a Goate. Come let's goe seeke my Father out. Exeunt. Enter Phylomont, Sciolto, and Buonateste. Phyl. Though I esteeme Theander at a rate, As if I vallew'd all his victories, And all the civill honours he hath wonne, By conqu'ring the misterious sense of bookes: And adde to this our loves, begotten in Our Infancy, our noble friendship of A better growth, Yet Eurithea is My Sister, and the chiefest of my blood, One whose virtue and perfection I'm so well Experienc'd in, that neither can admit My least suspition or my feare, th'are both Abus'd, but if my friend will grow too credulous, Ile learne to use him as my Enemy. Sciolt. For my part sir, I want instructions, what I should believe, and words to utter halfe The dismall wonders I have heard: But sure He doth proceed on grounds so relative, As would perswade the wisest to a Iealousie. Yet on my soule shee's cleare. Phylo. Then there is treachery, let it be found; If he permit my Sisters honour bleed, Without full arguments to warrant his Suspect, ere yet the circuit of one Moone Be added to my age, I'le give The people of this Province cause to curse Their Princes negligence. Buon. Your Grace hath found I've beene a little prosperous Of late in your affaire, trust me with this: Be pleas'd to tarry here a while conceal'd, You both shall finde I will untie these Magick knots, And strait restore the Innocent to such A light, as shall have force to make their virtue shine. Sciol. My man o'Medicines, if thou performe this Although old Ãsculape had but a Cock Allow'd him for a cure, thou every meale, Shalt have a brace of fat cram'd Capons at Thy board, each of em larger than a Dragon? Enter Theander like a Pilgrime. Theand. I seeke thee Phylimont, and like a friend Whose kindnesse growes upon him neere his death: I come to give thee Legacies, the Armes I woone At Capua are thine, and those Sardinian horse I chose for our last warre; my glories are Ecclips'd, and I will goe where there's no neede Of pollicie nor strength, unto some darke And emptie wildernesse, where Fame can put Her Trumpet to no use, where all my danger is Leanenesse, and cold, but I shall live secure, From Ladies that are faire and false. Phyl. Were I so cruell to beleeve the cause Of thy calamity a truth, I would Inuest me too in such a homely weed, And wander with thee where the Sunne, In's vniversall journey should not find Vs out? but thou art govern'd by mistakes, Some treacherous practise hath subdu'd thy sense; For both our safeties thinke my sister such, As I pronouce of thine, I must not find her in thy doubts. Theand. O Phylomont! I have Not blood enough to use in blushes, should I name her crime. Phylo. Thy passions I forgive agen! but marke How much they are mis-led, this learned Gentleman, Will free disguised truth out of that Labyrinth, And dismall shade where she resides, then give An instant remedy to all our griefes. Buon. But you must promise patience sir, and when I give the signe, retire to'th the Arras all silent and conceal'd. Theand. Such blessings as you promise seldome come From heaven, I'm sure no humane helpe can doe't. Enter Fredeline creeping in, as he were sicke. Buon. Away, listen and hide your selues, there stands The Conjurer that I must first outcharme. Fred. How am I Planet-struck, how suddenly Depriv'd of strength, I breath faintly, and short; Like wearied Coursers when the race is done: My sinewes shrinke, and beare me crooked when I move, as I had beene their load a hundred yeares. Palsies and Agues have possess'd my joints, I quiver like a naked Russian in The snow; and my dimme eyes begin to glare, And winke like to a long neglected I ampe Whose oyle is wasted to a dropp. Buon. The generous Fredeline? how doe you sir. Fred. Villaine, Th'ast poyson'd me, the minerals which Thou gavest me in thy fume were full of death? Buon. I must confesse they were not very wholesomeâ Fredeline offers to draw. Nay, be not angry sir, you draw a sword? You draw a knitting needle or a rush, Las poore weake gentleman? but if you could, Here at my old friend Archymedes ward I'ld stand.âWe Mathematick Mounsiers have Our lines revers'd, and our stoccato's too.
