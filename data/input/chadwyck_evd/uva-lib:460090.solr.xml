      <field name="fulltext">? petere inde coronam, Unde priÃ¹s nulli velÃ¢rint tempora MusÃ¦. Lucret.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The alterations and additions in this play (as performed at the Theatres) on comparing it with the original, were judged so necessary and judicious, and the omissions so numerous and intricate, that it was impracticable to give the original intire, without greatly embarassing the reader; such lines as could be restored (though omitted on the stage) are printed with inverted commas, those in Italics are added in the representation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. T he sickness hot, a master quit, for fear, H is house in town, and left one servant there; E ase him corrupted, and gave means to know, A cheater and his punk; who, now brought low, L eaving their narrow practice, were become C oz'ners at large; and only wanting some H ouse to set up, with him they here contract, E ach for a share, and all begin to act. M uch company they draw, and much abuse, I n casting figures, telling fortunes, news, S elling of flies, flat bawd'ry, with the stone; T ill it, and they, and all in fume are gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Fortune, that favours fools, these two short hours We wish away, both for your sakes and ours, Judging spectators; and desire in place, To the author justice, to ourselves but grace. Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known, No country's mirth is better than our own: No clime breeds better matter for your whore, Bawd, 'squire, impostor, many persons more, Whose manners, now call'd humours, feed the stage; And which have still been subject for the rage Or spleen of comic writers. Though this pen Did never aim to grieve, but better men; Howe'er the age he lives in doth endure The vices that she breeds, above their cure. But when the wholesome remedies are sweet, And in their working, gain and profit meet, He hopes to find no spirit so much diseas'd, But will with such fair correctives be pleas'd: For here he doth not fear who can apply. If there be any that will sit so nigh Unto the stream, to look what it doth run, They shall find things, they'ld think, or wish, were done; They are so natural follies, but so shewn, As even the doers may see, and yet not own.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Face, Subtle and Dol Common. Face. Believe it, I will. Sub. Do thy worst. I dare thee. Face. Sirrah, I'll strip you out of all your sleights. Dol. Nay, look ye, sovereign, general, are you madmen? Sub. O, let the wild sheep loose. I'll gum your silks With good strong-water, an' you come. Dol. Will you have The neighbours hear you? Will you betray all? âHark, I hear somebody.â Face. Sirrah! Sub. I shall mar All that the taylor has made, if you approach. Face. You most notorious whelp, you insolent slave, Dare you do this? Sub. Yes faith, yes faith. Face. Why, who Am I, my mungrel? Who am I? Sub. I'll tell you, Since you know not yourselfâ Face. Speak lower, rogue. Sub. Yes, you were once (time not long pass'd) the good, Honest, plain, livery-man, that kept Your master's worship's house here in the Friars, For the vacations. Face. Will you be so loud? Sub. Since, by my means, translated suburb-captain. Face. By your means, Doctor Dog? Sub. Within man's memory, All this I speak of. Face. Why, I pray you, have I Been countenanced by you, or you by me? Do but collect, Sir, where I met you first. Sub. I do not hear well. Face. But I shall put you in mind, Sir; at Pie-Corner, Taking your meal of steam in, from cooks' stalls; Where, like the father of hunger, you did walk Piteously costive, with your pinch'd-horn nose, And your complexion of the Roman watch, Stuck full of black and melancholic worms, Like powder corn shot at th'Artillery-yard. Sub. I wish you could advance your voice a little. Face. When you went pinn'd up in the several rags. You had rak'd and pick'd from dunghills, before day; Your feet in mouldy slippers, for your kibes A felt of rug, and a thin thredden cloak, That scarce would cover your no-buttocksâ Sub. So, Sir! Face. When all your alchymy, and your algebra, Your minerals, vegetals, and animals, Your conjuring, coz'ning, and your dozen of trades, Could not relieve your corpse with so much linen Would make you tinder but to see a fire; I gave you count'nance, credit for your coals, Your stills, your glasses, your materials; Built you a furnace, drew you customers, Advanc'd all your black arts; lent you, beside, A house to practise inâ Sub. Your master's house? Face. Where you have studied the more thriving skill. Of bawd'ry since. Sub. Yes, in your master's house. You and the rats here kept possession. Make it not strange. âI know you were one could keep âThe butt'ry hatch still lock'd, and save the chippings, âSell the dole-beer to aqua-vitÃ¦ men, âThe which, together with your Christmas vails âAt post and pair, your letting out of counters, âMade you a pretty stock, some twenty marks, âAnd gave you credit to converse with cobwebs âHere, since your mistress' death hath broke up house. âFace. You might talk softlier, rascal. âSub. No, you Scarabe; âI'll thunder you in pieces: I will teach you âHow to beware to tempt a fury again, âThat carries tempest in his hand and voice. âFace. The place has made you valiant. âSub. No, your cloaths. âThou vermin, have I ta'en thee out of dung, âSo poor, so wretched, when no living thing âWould keep thee company, but a spider, or worse! âRaised thee from brooms, and dust, and wat'ring pots! âSublim'd thee, and exalted thee, and fix'd thee âI' the third region, call'd our State of Grace âWrought thee to spirit, to quintessence, with pains âWould twice have won me the philosopher's work! âMade thee a second in mine own great art! âAnd have I this for thanks? Do you rebel? âDo you fly out i'the projection? âWould you begone now? âDol. Gentlemen, what mean you? âWill you mar all? âSub. Slave, thou hadst no nameâ âDol. Will you undo yourselves with civil war? âSub. Never been known, past equi elibanum, âThe heat of horse-dung, under ground, in cellars, âOr an ale-house darker than deaf John's; been lost âTo all mankind, but laundresses and tapsters, âHad not I been. âDol. Do you know who hears you, sovereign? âFace. Sirrahâ âDol. Nay, general, I thought you were civilââ Face. I shall turn desperate, if you grow thus loud. Sub. And hang thyself, I care not. Face. Hang thee, Collier, And all thy pots and pans, in picture, âI will, âSince thou hast mov'd meâ âDol. Oh, this 'll o'erthrow all. âFace. Write thee up bawd in Pawl's, have all thy tricks âOf coz'ning with a hollow coal, dust, scrapings, âSearching for things lost with a sieve and shears, âErecting figures in your rows of houses, âAnd taking in of shadows with a glass, âTold in red letters; and face cut for thee, âWorse than Gamaliel Ratsey's. âDol. Are you sound? âHa' you your senses, masters? âFace. I will have âA book, but barely reckoning thy impostures, âShall prove a true philosopher's stone to printers.â Sub. Away, you trencher-rascal. Face. Out, you dog-leach, The vomit of all prisons. Dol. Will you be Your own destructions, gentlemen? Sub. Cheater. Face. Bawd. Sub. Cow-herd. Face. Conjurer. Sub. Cut-purse. Dol. We are ruined! lost! Ha'you no more regard To your reputations? Where's your judgment? 'Slight, Have yet some care of me, o' your republickâ Face. Away, this brach. I'll bring the rogue within The statute of sorcery, 'tricesimo tertio âOf Harry the Eighth; ay, and, perhaps, thy neck âWithin a noose, for laundring gold, and barbing it.â Dol. You'll bring your head within a cockscomb, will you? [She catches out Face's sword, and breaks Subtle's glass. And you, Sir, with your Menstrue, gather it up. 'Sdeath! you abominable pair of stinkards, Leave off your barking, and grow one again, Or, by the light that shines, I'll cut your throats. I'll not be made a prey unto the marshal, For ne'er a snarling dog-bolt o' you both. Ha' you together cozen'd all this while, And all the world? and shall it now be said, Yo' have made most courteous shift to cozen yourselves? You will accuse him! You will bring him in Within the statute! Who shall take your word? A whoreson, upstart, apocryphal captain, Whom not a puritan in Black-Friars will trust So much as for a feather! And you too Will give the cause, forsooth! You will insult, And claim a primacy in the divisions! You must be chief! As if you only had The powder to project with, and the work Were not begun out of equality? The venture tripartite! All things in common; Without priority. Face. It is his fault; He ever murmurs, and objects his pains; And says, the weight of all lies upon him. Sub. Why, so it does. Dol. How does it? Do not we Sustain our parts? Sub. Yes, but they are not equal. Dol. Why, if your part exceed to-day, I hope Ours may to-morrow match it. Sub. Ay, they may. Dol. May, murmuring mastiff! Ay, and do. Death on me! Help me to throttle him. Sub. Dorothy, Mistress Dorothy! 'Ods precious, I'll do any thing. What do you mean? Dol. Because o' your fermentation and cibationâ Sub. Not I, by Heavenâ Dol. Your Sol and Lunaâhelp me. Sub. Would I were hang'd then. I'll conform myself. Dol. Will you, Sir? Do so then, and quickly: swear. Sub. What shall I swear? Dol. To leave your faction, Sir, And labour kindly in the common work. Sub. Let me not breathe, if I meant ought beside. I only us'd those speeches as a spur To him. Dol. I hope we need no spurs, Sir. Do we? Face. 'Slid, prove to-day, who shall shark best. Sub. Agreed. Dol. Yes, and work close and friendly. Sub. 'Slight, the knot Shall grow the stronger for this breach with me. Dol. Why so, my good baboons! Shall we go make A sort of sober, scurvy, precise neighbours, (That scarce have smil'd twice sin' the king came in) A feast of laughter at our follies? No, agree. And may Don Provost ride a feasting long, In his old velvet jerkin, (My noble sovereign, and worthy general) Ere we contribute a new cruel garter To his most worsted worship. Sub. Royal Dol! Spoken like Claridiana and thyself. Face. For which, at supper, thou shalt sit in triumph, And not be stil'd Dol Common, but Dol Proper, Dol Singular: âthe longest cut, at night, âShall draw thee for his Dol Particular.â [One knocks. Sub. Who's that? [Knocks] To the window, Pray heav'n The master do not trouble us this quarter. Face. Oh, fear not him. âWhile there dies one a Week âO' the plague, he's safe from thinking toward London. âBeside, he's busy at his hop-yards now: âI had a letter from him. If he do, âHe'll send such word, for airing o' the house, âAs you shall have sufficient time to quit it: âTho' we break up a fortnight, 'tis no matter.â Sub. Who is it, Dol? Dol. A fine young quodling. Face. Oh, My Lawyer's clerk, I lighted on last night In Holborn at the Dagger. He would have (I told you of him) a familiar, To rifle with at horses, and win cups. Dol. Oh, let him in. Face. Get you Your robes on: I will meet him, as going out. Dol. And what shall I do? Face. Not be seen. Away. Seem you very reserv'd. Sub. Enough. Face. God be with you, Sir. I pray you let him know that I was here. His Name is Dapper. I would gladly have staid, butâ Enter Dapper. Dap. Captain, I am here. Sub. Who's that? Face. He's come, I think, Doctor. Good faith, Sir, I was going away. Dap. In truth, I am very sorry, Captain. Face. But I thought Sure I should meet you. Dap. Ay, I am very glad. I had a scurvy writ or two to make, And I had lent my watch last night to one That dines to day at the sheriff's, and so was robb'd Of ny pass-time? Is this the cunning-man? Face. This is his worship. Dap. Is he a doctor? Face. Yes. Dap. And ha' your broke with him, Captain? Face. Ay. Dap. And how? Face. Faith, he does make the matter, Sir, so dainty, I know not what to say. Dap. Not so, good Captain. Face. Would I were fairly rid on't, believe me. Dap. Nay, now you grieve me, Sir. Why should you wish so? I dare assure you, I'll not be ungrateful. âFace. I cannot think you will, Sir. But the law âIs such a thing.âAnd then he says, Read's matter âFalling so lately.â âDap. Read! he was an ass, âAnd dealt, Sir, with a fool. âFace. It was a clerk, Sir. âDap. A clerk! âFace. Nay, hear me, Sir, you know the law âBetter, I think.â âDap. I should, Sir, and the danger. âYou know, I shew'd the statute to you. âFace. You did so. âDap. And will I tell then? By this hand of flesh, âWould it might never write good court-hand more, âIf I discover. What do you think of me, âThat I am a Chiause? âFace. What's that? âDap. The Turk was, hereâ âAs one would say, do you think I am a Turk?â Face. I'll tell the Doctor so. Dap. Do, good sweet Captain. Face. Come, noble Doctor, pray thee let's prevail; This is the gentleman, and he is no Chiause. Sub. Captain, I have return'd you all my answer. I would do much, Sir, for your loveâbut this I neither may, nor can. Face. Tut, do not say so. You deal now with a noble fellow, Doctor, One that will thank you richly, âand he's no Chiause.â Let that, Sir, move you. Sub. Pray you, forbear. Face. He has Four angels here. Sub. You do me wrong, good Sir. Face. Doctor, wherein? To tempt you with these spirits! Sub. To tempt my art, and love, Sir, to my peril. 'Fore Heaven, I scarce can think you are my friend, That so would draw me to apparent danger. Face. I draw you! a horse draw you, and a halter. You and your flies together. Dap. Nay, good Captain. Face. That know no difference of men. Sub. Good words, Sir. Face. Good deeds, Sir, Doctor Dogs-meat. Dap. Nay, dear Captain, Use master Doctor with some more respect. Face. Hang him, proud stag, with his broad velvet head. But for your sake, I'd choak, ere I would change An article of breath with such a puckfoistâ Come, let's be gone. Sub. Pray you, let me speak with you. Dap. His Worship calls you, Captain. Face. I am sorry I e'er embark'd myself in such a business. Dap. Nay, good Sir, he did call you. Face. Will he take then? Sub. First hear meâ Face. Not a syllable, 'less you take. Sub. Pray ye, Sirâ Face. Upon no terms, but an assumpsit. Sub. Your humour must be law. [He takes money. Face. Why now, Sir, talk. Now I dare hear you with mine honour. Speak. So may this gentleman too. Sub. Why, Sirâ Face. No whispering. Sub. Fore heaven, you do not apprehend the loss You do yourself in this. Face. Wherein? For what? Sub. Marry, to be so importunate for one, That, when he has it, will undo you all! He'll win up all the money i'the town, If it be set him. âFace. How! âSub. Yes, and blow up gamester after gamester, âAs they do crackers in a puppet-play. âIf I do give him a familiar, âGive you him all you play for: never set him; âFor he will have it. âFace. You are mistaken, Doctor. âWhy, he does ask one but for cups and horses, âA rifling fly; none o' your great familiars. âDap. Yes, Captain, I would have it for all games. âSub. I told you so. âFace. 'Slight, that's a new business! âI understood you, a tame bird, to fly âTwice in a term, or so, on Friday nights, âWhen you had left the office, for a nag âOf forty or fifty shillings. âDap. Ay, 'tis true, Sir; âBut I do think now I shall leave the law, âAnd thereforeâ âFace. Why, this changes quite the case! âDo you think that I dare move him? âDap. If you please, Sir; âAll's one to him, I see. âFace. What! for that money? âI cannot with my conscience: nor should you âMake the request, methinks. âDap. No, Sir, I mean âTo add consideration. âFace. Why then, Sir, âI'll try. Say that it were for all games, Doctor. âSub. I say then, not a mouth shall eat for him âAt any ordinary, but o' the score, âThat is a gaming month, conceive me. âFace. Indeed! âSub. He'll draw you all the treasure of the realm, âIf it be set him.â Face. Speak you this from art? Sub. Ay, Sir, and reason too, the ground of art. He is o' the only best complexion The queen of fairy loves. Face. What! is he! Sub. Peace. He'll over-hear you. Sir, should she but see himâ Face. What? Sub. Do not you tell him. Face. Will he win at cards too? Sub. He will, he will, âThe spirits of dead Holland, living Isaac, âYou'd swear, were in him; such a vigorous luck âAs cannot be resisted. 'Slight, he'll put âSix o' your gallants to a cloak indeed.â Face. Indeed, a strange success that some men should be born to! Sub. He hears you, man. Dap. Sir, I'll not be ungrateful. Face. Faith, I have confidence in his good nature: You hear, he says he will not be ungrateful. Sub. Why, as you please; my venture follows yours. Face. Troth, do it, Doctor; think him trusty, and make him. He may make us both happy in an hour; Win some five thousand pound, and send us two on't. Dap. Believe it, and I will, Sir. Face. And you shall, Sir. You have heard all? Dap. No, what was't? Nothing, I, Sir. Face. Nothing? [Face takes him aside. Dap. A little, Sir. Face. Well, a rare star Reign'd at your birth. Dap. At mine, Sir! No. Face. The Doctor Swears that you areâ Sub. Nay, Captain, you'll tell all now. Face. Allied to the Queen of Fairy. Dap. Who! that I am? Believe it, no such matter.â Face. Yes, and that You were born with a caul o' your head. Dap. Who says so? Face. Come, You know it well enough, tho' you dissemble it. Dap. I-fac, I do not; you are mistaken. Face. How! Swear by your fac! and in a thing so known Unto the Doctor? How shall we, Sir, trust you I'th'other matter? Can we ever think, When you have won five or six thousand pound, You'll send us shares in't, by this rate? Dap. By Jove, Sir, I'll win ten thousand pound, and send you half. I-fac's no oath. Sub. No, no, he did but jest. Face. Go to. Go thank the Doctor. He's your friend, To take it so. Dap. I thank his Worship. Face. Do you think that will do? No, no; Give him another angel. Dap. Must I? Face. Must you! 'Slight, What else is thanks? Will you be trivial? Doctor, When must he come for his familiar? Dap. Shall I not ha' it with me? Sub. Oh, good Sir! There must be a world of ceremonies pass; You must be bath'd and fumigated first: Besides, the Queen of Fairy does not rise Till it be noon. Face. Not if she danc'd to-night. Sub. And she must bless it. Face. Did you never see Her Royal Grace yet? Dap. Whom? Face. Your aunt of Fairy. Sub. Not since she kiss'd him in the cradle, Captain; I can resolve you that. Face. Well, see her Grace, Whate'er it cost you, for a thing that I know. It will be somewhat hard to compass; but, However, see her. You are made, believe it, If you can see her. Her Grace is a lone woman, And very rich; and if she take a phant'sy, She will do strange things. See her, at any hand. 'Slid, she may hap to leave you all she has! It is the Doctor's fear. Dap. How will't be done then? Face. Let me alone, take you no thought. Do you But say to me, Captain, I'll see her Grace. Dap. Captain, I'll see her Grace. Face. Enough. Sub. Who's there? [One knocks without. Anon. Conduct him forth by the back way.â Sir, against one o'clock prepare yourself; Till when you must be fasting; only take Three drops of vinegar in at your nose, Two at your mouth, and one at either ear; Then bathe your fingers ends, and wash your eyes, To sharpen your five senses, and cry hum Thrice, and buz as often; and then come. Face. Can you remember this? Dap. I warrant you. Face. Well then away. 'Tis but your bestowing. Some twenty nobles 'mong her Grace's servants, And put on a clean shirt; you do not know What grace her Grace may do you in clean linen. Dap. Humâbuz. [Exit. Face. Humâbuz. [Exit. Sub. Come in. Enter Drugger. [Within.] I will see the Doctor. Sub. Good wives, I pray you forbear me now: Troth, I can do you no good till afternoon.â What is your name, say you? Abel Drugger? Drug. Yes, Sir. Sub. A seller of tobacco? Drug. Yes, Sir. Sub. Umh. Free of the Grocers? Drug. Yes, I'm free of the Grocers. Sub. Wellâ Your business, Abel? Drug. This an't please your worship. I am a young beginner, and am building Of a new shop, an't like your worship, just At corner of a street (here is the plot on't): And I would know by art, Sir, of your worship, Which way I should make my door, by necromancy, And where my shelves; and which should be for boxes, And which for pots. I would be glad to thrive, Sir. And I was wish'd to your worship by a gentleman, One Captain Face, that says you know men's planets, And their good angels, and their bad. Sub. I do, If I do see them. Enter Face. Face. What! my honest Abel? Thou art well met here. Drug. Troth, Sir, I was speaking Just as your worship came here, of your worship. I pray you speak for me to master doctor. Face. He shall do any thing. Doctor, do you hear? This is my friend, Abel, an honest fellow; He lets me have good tobacco, and he Does not sophisticate it. Drug. No, I never sophisticate it. Face. Nor wrap it up in piss'd clouts. Drug. Oh, fye for shame, Captain. Face. He's a neat, spruce, honest fellow, and no goldsmith. Drug. No, I am no goldsmith. Sub. He's a fortunate fellow, that I am sure onâ Face. Already, Sir, ha'you found it! Lo'thee, Abel! Sub. And in right way towards richesâ Face. Sir. Sub. This summer He will be of the cloathing of his company, And next spring call'd to the scarlet, spend what he can. Face. What, and so little beard? Sub. You must think, He may have a receipt to make hair come: But he'll be wise, preserve his youth, and fine for't; His fortune looks for him another way. Face. 'Slid, Doctor, how canst thou know this so soon? I am amaz'd at that! Sub. By a rule, Captain, In Metaposcopy, which I do work by: A certain star i' the forehead, which you see not. Your chesnut, or your olive colour'd face, Does never fail: and your long ear doth promise. I knew't, by certain spots too, in his teeth, And on the nail of his mercurial finger. Face. Which finger's that? Sub. His little finger. Look, You were born upon a Wednesday? Drug. âYes, indeed, Sir,â and so I was. Sub. The thumb in Chiromancy, we give Venus; The fore-finger, to Jove; the midst, to Saturn; The ring, to Sol; the least, to Mercury, Who was the lord, Sir, of his Horoscope, His House of Life being Libra; which foreshew'd He should be a merchant, and should trade with balance. Face. Why this is strange? Is't not, honest Nab? Drug. Yes, very strange. Sub. There is a ship now, coming from Ormus, That shall yield him such a commodity Of drugsâCome hither, Abel; This is the west, and this is the south. Drug. Yes, Sir. Sub. And those are your two sides? Drug. Ay, Sir. Sub. Make me your door then south; your broadside, west: And, on the east-side of your shop, aloft, Write Mathlai, Tarmael, and Baraborat: Upon the north-part, Rael, Velel, Thiel. They are the names of those Mercurial spirits, That do fright flies from boxes. Drug. Yes, Sir. Sub. And Beneath your threshold, bury me a loadstone To draw in gallants, that wear spurs; the rest They'll seem to follow. Face. That's a secret, Nab. Sub. And, on your stall, a puppet, with a vice, And a court-fucus to call city-dames. You shall deal much with minerals, Drug. Sir, I have At home, already. Sub. Ay, I know, you have, Arsnike, Vitriol, Salt-tartre, Argale, Alkaly, Cinoper: I know all. This fellow, Captain, Will come, in time, to be a great distiller, And give a 'say (I will not say directly, But very fair) at the Philosopher's Stone. Face. Why, how now, Abel! is this true? Drug. Good Captain, What must I give? Face. Nay, I'll not counsel thee. Thou hear'st what wealth (he says spend what thou canst) Th'art like to come to. Drug. I would give him a crown. Face. A crown! and towards such a fortune? Heart, Thou shalt rather gi' him thy shop. No gold about thee? Drug. Yes, I have a Portague, I have kept this half year, And I would fain keep it half a year longer. Face. Out on thee, Nab. 'Slight, there was such an offer, 'Shalt keep 't no longer, I'll gi' it him for thee. Drug. Will ye? Face. Doctor, Nab prays your worship to drink this, and swears He will appear more grateful, as your skill Does raise him in the world. Drug. I would intreat Another favour of his worship. Face. What is't, Nab? Drug. But, to look over, Sir, my almanack, And cross out my ill days, that I may neither Bargain nor trust upon them. Face. That he shall, Nab. Leave it, it shall be done, 'gainst afternoon. Sub. And a direction for his shelves. Face. Now, Nab, Art thou well pleased, Nab? Drug. Thank, Sir, both your worships, I am a made man. [Exit. Face. Away. Why, now you smoaky persecutor of nature! Now do you see, that something's to be done, Beside your beech-coal, and your cor'sive waters, âYour crosslets, crucibles, and cucurbites? âYou must have stuff, brought home to you, to work on?â And yet, you think, I am at no expence In searching out these veins, then following them, Then trying them out. 'Fore God, my intelligence Costs me more money than my share oft comes to In these rare works. Sub. You are pleasant, Sir.âHow now? Enter Dol. Face. What says my dainty Dolkin? Dol. Yonder fish-wife Will not away. And there's your giantess, The bawd of Lambeth. Sub. Heart, I cannot speak with them. Dol. Not afore night, I have told them, in a voice, Through the trunk, like one of your familiars. But I have spied Sir Epicure Mammon. Sub. Where? Dol. Coming along, at far end of the lane, Slow of his feet, but earnest of his tongue, To one that's with him. Sub. Face, go you, and shift. Dol, you must presently make ready, tooâ Dol. Why, what's the matter? Sub. Oh, I did look for him With the sun's rising: marvel, he could sleep! This is the day I am to perfect for him The Magisterium, our Great-Work, the Stone; And yield it, made into his hands; of which, He has, this month, talk'd, as he were possess'd, âAnd now he's dealing pieces on't away. âMethinks I see him entering ordinaries, âDispensing for the pox, and plaguy houses, âReaching his dose, walking Moorfields for lepers, âSearching the spittle, to make old bawds young; âAnd the highways, for beggars to make rich: âI see no end of my labours. He will make âNature asham'd of her long sleep; when art, âWho's but a step dame, shall do more than she,â He's, in belief of chymistry, so bold, If his dream last, he'll turn the age to gold.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Mammon and Surly. Mammon. Come on, Sir. Now you set your foot on shore In novo orbe; here's the rich Peru: And there within, Sir, are the golden mines, Great Solomon's Ophir! He was sailing to't Three years, but we have reach'd it in ten months. This is the day, wherein, to all my friends, I will pronounce the happy word, Be rich. This day you shall be spectatissimi, And have you punques, and punquetees, my Surly. And unto thee, I speak it first, Be rich.âFace, Where is my Subtle, there?âWithin, ho! Face. [Within.] Sir, he'll come to you, by and by. Mam. That's his fire-drake. His lungs, his Zephirus, he that puffs his coals, Till he firk Nature up in her own center. You are doubtful, Sir. This night, I'll change All that is metal, in my house, to gold. And, early in the morning, will I send To all the plumbers, and the pewterers, And buy their tin, and lead up; and to Lothbury, For all the copper. Sur. What, and turn that too? Mam. Yes, and I'll purchase Devonshire and Cornwall, And make them perfect Indies! you admire now? Sur. No, faith. Mam. But when you see the effects of the great medicine, You will believe me. Sur. Yes, when I see't, I will. Mam. Why? Do you think, I sable with you? I assure you, He that has once the Flower of the Sun, The perfect ruby, which we call Elixir, Not only can do that, but by its virtue, Can confer honour, love, respect, long life, Give safety, valour, yea, and victory. To whom he will. In eight and twenty days, I'll make an old man of fourscore a child. Sur. No doubt, he's that already. Mam. Nay, I mean, Restore his years, renew him, like an eagle, To the fifth age; make him get sons and daughters, Become stout Marses, and beget young Cupids. Sur. The decay'd vestals of Drury-Lane would thank you, That keep the fire alive there. Mam. 'Tis the secret Of Nature, naturiz'd 'gainst all infections, Cures all diseases coming of all causes; A month's grief in a day; a year's in twelve: And of what age soever, in a month. Past all the doses of your drugging doctors. You're still incredulous. Sur. Faith I have a humour, I would not willingly be gull'd. Your Stone Cannot transmute me. Mam. Surly, Will you believe antiquity? Records? I'll shew you a book, where Moses, and his sister, And Solomon, have written of the art; Ay, and a treatise penn'd by Adam. Sur. How! Mam. O' the Philosopher's Stone, and in High Dutch. Sur. Did Adam write, Sir, in High Dutch? Mam. He did. Which proves it was the primitive tongue. How now? Enter Face. Do we succeed? Is our day come? and holds it? Face. The evening will set red upon you, Sir: You have colour for it, crimson: the red ferment Has done his office; three hours hence, prepare you To see projection. Mam. My Surly, Again, I say to thee, aloud, Be rich; This day, thou shalt have ingots; and, to-morrow, Give lords th'affront. Is it, my Zephirus, right? Blushes the bolt's-head? Face. Like a wench with child, Sir, That were, but now, discover'd to her master. Mam. Excellent witty, Lungs! My only care is, Where to get stuff enough now, to project on. This town will not half serve me. Face. No, Sir? Buy The covering off o' churches. Mam. That's true. Face. Yes, Let them stand bare, as do their auditory; Or cap them new with shingles. Mam. No, good thatch: Thatch will lie light upon the rafters, Lungs. Lungs, I will manumit thee from the furnace; I will restore thee thy complexion, Puffe, Lost in the embers; and repair this brain, Hurt wi' the fume o' the metals. Face. I have blown, Sir, Hard for your worship; these blear'd eyes Have wak'd, to read your several colours, Sir; Of the pale citron, the green lion, the crow, The peacock's tail, the plumed swan. Mam. And lastly, Thou hast descry'd the flower. Face. Yes, Sir. Mam. Where's master? Face. At his prayers, Sir: he, Good man, he's doing his devotions, For the success. Mam. Lungs, I will set a period To all thy labours: thou shalt be the master Of my Seraglio. Face. Good, âSir. âMam. But do you hear? âI'll geld you, Lungs. âFace. Yes,â Sir. Mam. For I do mean To have a list of wives and concubines, Equal with Solomon, who had the Stone Alike with me: âand I will make me a back âWith the Elixir, that shall be as tough âAs Hercules, to encounter fifty a night.â Th'art sure thou saw'st it, blood? Face. Both blood and spirit, Sir. Mam. I will have all my beds blown up; not stuff'd; Down is too hard. (Is it arriv'd at ruby?)âWhere I spy A wealthy citizen, or a rich lawyer, Have a sublim'd pure wife, unto that fellow I'll send a thousand pounds, to be my cuckold. Face. And shall I carry it? Mam. No, I'll have no bawds, But fathers and mothers. They will do it best, Best of all others. And my flatterers Shall be the pure, and gravest of divines That I can get for money. My meet fools, Eloquent burgesses. We will be brave, Puffe, now we have the med'cine. My meat shall all come in, in Indian shells. Dishes of agate set in gold, and studded With emeralds, saphirs, hyacinths, and rubies. My foot-boy shall eat pheasants, calver'd salmons, Knots, godwits, lampreys: I myself will have The beards of barbels serv'd instead of sallads; Oil'd mushrooms, âand the swelling unctuous paps âOf a fat pregnant sow, newly cut off,â Dress'd with an exquisite and poignant sauce; For which, I'll say unto my cook, there's gold, Go forth, and be a knight. Face. Sir, I'll go look A little, how it heightens. [Exit. Mam. Do. My shirts I'll have of taffata-sarsnet, soft and light As cob-webs, and for all my other rayment, It shall be such as might provoke the Persian, Were he to teach the world riot anew. My gloves of fishes and birds-skins, perfum'd With gums of Paradise, and eastern airâ Sur. And do you think to have the Stone with this? Mam. No, I do think t'have all this with the Stone. Sur. Why, I have heard, he must be homo frugi, A pious, holy, and religious man, One free from mortal sin, a very virgin. Mam. That makes it, Sir, he is so. But I buy it. My venture brings it me. He, honest wretch, A notable, superstitious, good soul, Has worn his knees bare, and his slippers bald, With prayer and fasting for it; and, Sir, let him Do it alone, for me, still. Here he comes. Not a prophane word, afore him: 'tis poison. Enter Subtle. Good-morrow, father. Sub. Gentle son, good-morrow. And to your friend there. What is he? is with you? Mam. An heretic that I did bring along, In hope, Sir, to convert him. Sub. Son, I doubt Yo'are covetous, that thus you meet your time I' the just point: prevent your day, at morning, This argues something, worthy of a fear Of importune, and carnal appetite; Take heed, do you not cause the blessing to leave you, it With your ungovern'd haste. I should be sorry To see my labours, now e'en at perfection, Got by long watching, and large patience, Not prosper, where my love and zeal hath placed them. Which in all my ends, Have look'd no way, but unto public good. To pious uses, and dear charity, Now grown a prodigy with men. Wherein If you, my son, should now prevaricate, And, to your own particular lusts, employ So great and catholic a bliss, be sure, A curse will follow, yea, and overtake Your subtle and most secret ways. Mam. I know, Sir. You shall not need to fear me. I but come, To have you to confute this gentleman. Sur. Who is, Indeed, Sir, somewhat costive of belief Toward your Stone; would not be gull'd. Sub. Well, son, All that I can convince him in, is this: The work is done; bright Sol is in his robe. We have a medicine of the triple soul, Thanks be to Heaven, And make us worthy of it. Ulen Spigel! Face. [Within.] Anon, Sir. Sub. Look well to the register, And let your heat still lessen by degrees, To the Aludels. âFace. Yes, Sir. âSub. Did you look âO'the Bolt's head yet? âFace. Which, on D, Sir? âSub. Ay. âWhat's the complexion? âFace. Whitish. âSub. Infuse vinegar âTo draw his volatile substance, and his tincture; âAnd let the water in glass E. be filter'd, âAnd put into the Gripe's egg.â Lute him well; And leave him clos'd in balneo; And bring me the complexion of glass B. Face. I will, Sir. [Exit Face. Sur. What a brave language here is! next to canting! Sub. I have another work, you never saw, son, That three days since pass'd the philosopher's wheel, In the lent heat of Athanor; and is become Sulphur of Nature. Mam. But 'tis for me? Sub. What need you? You have enough, in that is perfect. Mam. Oh, butâ Sub. Why, this is covetous! Mam. No, I assure you, I shall employ it all in pious uses, Founding of colleges and grammar schools, Marrying young virgins, building hospitals, And now and then a church. Enter Face. âSub. How now? âFace. Sir, please you, âShall I not change the feltre? âSub. Marry, yes, âAnd bring me the complexion of glass B. [Exit Face. âMam. Have you another? âSub. Yes, son, were I assur'd âYour piety were firm, we would not want âThe means to glorify it. But I hope the best: âI mean to tinct C. in sand-heat, to-morrow, âAnd give him imbition. âMam. Of white oil? âSub. No, Sir, of red. F is come over the helm too, âIn St. Mary's Bath, and shews lac virginis. âI sent you of his fÃ¦ces there calcin'd. âOut of that calx, I have won the salt of mercury. âMam. By pouring on your rectified water?â Sub. âYes, and reverberating in Athanor.â How now? What colour says it? Enter Face. Face. The ground black, Sir. Mam. That's your crow's head? Sur. Your cocks-comb's, is't not? Sub. No, 'tis not perfect, would it were the crow. That work wants something. Sur. Oh, I look'd for this. The hay's a pitching. Sub. Are you sure, you loosed them In their own menstrue? Face. Yes, Sir, and then married them, And put them in a bolt's head, nipp'd to digestion, According as you bade me, when I set The liquor of Mars to circulation, In the same heat. Sub. The process then was right. Face. Yes, by the token, Sir, the retort brake, And what was sav'd was put into the pellicane, And sign'd with Hermes' seal. Sub. I think 'twas so. We should have a new amalgama. Sur. Oh, this ferret Is rank as any pole-cat. Sub. But I care not. Let him e'en die; âwe have enough beside, âIn embrion. H has his white shirt on? âFace. Yes, Sir. âHe's ripe for inceration: he stands warm âIn his ash fire.â I would not, you should let Any die now, if I might counsel, Sir, For luck's sake to the rest. It is not good. Mam. He says right. Sur. Ay, are you bolted? Face. Nay, I know't, Sir, I have seen th'ill fortune. What is some three ounces Of fresh materials? Mam. Is't no more? Face. No more, Sir, Of gold, t'amalgame, with some six of mercury. Mam. Away, here's money. What will serve? Face. Ask him, Sir. Mam. How much? Sub. Give him nine pounds: you may give him ten. Sur. Yes. Twenty, and be cozened, do. Mam. There 'tis. Sub. This needs not. But that you will have it so, To see conclusions of all, âfor two âO'four inferior works are at fixation, âA third is in ascension.â Go your ways. Have you set the oil of Luna in Kemia? Face. Yes, Sir. Sub. And the philosopher's vinegar? Face. Ay. [Exit. Sur. We shall have a sallad. Mam. When do you make projection? Sub. Son, be not hasty. I exalt our med'cine, By hanging him in balneo vaporaso, And giving him solution, then congeal him, And then dissolve him, then again congeal him: For look, how oft I iterate the work, So many times I add unto his virtue. Get you your stuff here against afternoon, Your brass, your pewter, and your andirons. Mam. Not those of iron? Sub. Yes, you may bring them too. We'll change all metals. Sur. I believe you in that. Mam. Then I may send my spits? Sub. Yes, and your racks. Sur. And dripping-pans, and pot-hangers, and hooks Shall he not? Sub. If he please. Sur. To be an ass. Sub. How, Sir! Mam. This gent'man you must bear withal! I told you, he had no faith. Sur. And little hope, Sir; But much less charity, should I gull myself. Sub. Why, what have you observ'd, Sir, in our art, Seems so impossible? Sur. But your whole work, no more. That you should hatch gold in a furnace, Sir, As they do eggs in Egypt! Sub. Sir, do you Believe that eggs are hatched so? Sur. If I should? Sub. Why I think that the greater miracle. No egg but differs from a chicken more Than metals in themselves. Sur. That cannot be. The egg's ordained by Nature to that end, And is a chicken in potentia. Sub. The same we say of lead, and other metals Which would be gold, if they had time. Mam. And that Our art doth further. Sub. Ay, for 'twere absurd To think that nature in the earth bred gold Perfect i' the instant. Something went before. There must be remote matter. Sur. Ay, what is that? Enter Doll. Sub. Marry, we sayâ God's preciousâWhat do you mean? Go in, good lady, Let me intreat you.âWhere's this varlet? Enter Face. Face. Sir? Sub. You very knave! Do you use me thus? Face. Wherein, Sir? Sub. Go in, and see, you traitor. Go. [Exit Face. Mam. Who is it, Sir? Sub. Nothing, Sir. Nothing. Mam. What's the matter, good Sir? I have not seen you thus distemper'd? Who is't? Sub. All arts have still had, Sir, their adversaries; But ours the most ignorant. What now? [Face returns. Face. 'Twas not my fault, Sir; she would speak with you. Sub. Would she, Sir? Follow me. [Exit Sub. Mam. Stay, Lungs. Face. I dare not, Sir. Mam. How! Pray thee stay. Face. She's mad, Sir, and sent hitherâ Mam. Stay, man, what is she? Face. A lord's sister, Sir. He'll be mad too. Mam. I warrant thee. Why sent hither? Face. Sir, to be cur'd. Sur. Why rascal? Face. Lo you. Here, Sir. [He goes out. Mam. 'Fore heaven, a bradamante, a brave piece. Sur. Heart, this is a bawdy house! I'll be burnt else. Mam. Oh, by this light, no do not wrong him. He's Too scrupulous that way. It is his vice. No, he's a rare physician, do him right, An excellent Paracelsian, and has done Strange cure with mineral physick. He deals all With spirits, he. He will not hear a word Of Galen or his tedious recipe's. Enter Face. How now, Lungs! Face. Softly, Sir, speak softly. I meant To have told your worship all. This must not hear. Mam. No, he will not be gull'd: let him alone. Face. Y'are very right, Sir, she is a most rare scholar, And is gone mad with studying Broughton's works. If you but name a word touching the Hebrew, She falls into her fit, and will discourse So learnedly of genealogies, As you would run mad too, to hear her, Sir. Mam. How might one do t'have conference with her, Lungs? Face. Oh, divers have run mad upon the conference. I do not know, Sir: I am sent in haste, To fetch a viol. [Exit. Sur. Be not gull'd, Sir Mammon. Mam. Wherein? Pray ye, be patient. Sur. Yes, as you are, And trust confederate knaves, and bawds, and whores. Mam. You are too foul, believe it. Enter Face. Come here, Ulen, one word. Face. I dare not, in good faith. Mam. Stay, knave. Face. He is extreme angry that you saw her, Sir. Mam. Drink that. [Gives him money.] What is she when she's out of her fit? Face. Oh, the most affablest creature, Sir! so merry! So pleasant! she'll mount you up, like quick-silver, Over the helm; and circulate, like oil, A very vegetal: discourse of state, Of mathematics, bawdry, any thingâ Mam. Is she no ways accessible? No means, No trick to give a man a taste of herâwitâ Or so? [Sub. within.] Ulen. Face. I'll come to you again, Sir. [Exit. Mam. Surly, I did not think one of your breeding Would traduce personages of worth. Sur. Sir Epicure, Your friend to use: yet, still, loth to be gull'd. I do not like your philosophical bawds. Their Stone is enough to pay for, Without this bait. Mam. 'Heart, you abuse yourself. I know the lady, and her friends, and means, The original of this disaster. Her brother Has told me all. Sur. And yet you never saw her Till now? Mam. Oh, yes! but I forgot: I have, believe it, One of the treacherousest memories, I do think, Of all mankind. Sur. What call you her brother? Mam. My Lordâ He will not have his name known, now I think on't. Sur. A very treacherous memory! Mam. O' my faith! Sur. Tut, if you ha' it not about you, pass it, Till we meet next. Mam. Nay, by this hand, 'tis true: He's one I honour, and my noble friend, And I respect his house. Sur. Heart! can it be, That a grave Sir, a rich, that has no need, A wise Sir, too, at other times, should thus, With his own oaths and arguments, make hard means To gull himself? âAn this be your elixir, âYour lapis mineralis, and your lunary, âGive me your honest trick yet at primero; âI'll have gold before you, âAnd with less danger of the quicksilver, âOr the hot sulphur.â Enter Face. Face. Here's one from Captain Face, Sir, [To Surly. Desires you to meet him i' the Temple Church, Some half hour hence, and upon earnest business. Sir, if you please to quit us now, and come [He whispers Mammon. Again within two hours, you shall have My master busy examining o'the works; And I will steal you in unto the party, That you may see her converse. Sir, shall I say You'll meet the Captain's worship? Sur. Sir, I will. [Exit Face. Now, I am sure it is a bawdy-house; âI'll swear it, were the Marshal here to thank me:â The naming this commander doth confirm it. Don Face! why 'tis the most authentic dealer. I' these commoditiesâThe superintendant To all the quainter traffickers in town. Him will I prove, by a third person, to find The subtleties of this dark labyrinth; Which, if I do discover, dear Sir Mammon, You'll give your poor friend leave, tho' no philosopher, To laugh; for you that are, 'tis thought, shall weep. Enter Face. Face. Sir, he does pray, you'll not forget. Sur. I will not, Sir. Sir Epicure, I shall leave you. [Exit. Mam. I follow you, straight. Face. But do so, good Sir, to avoid suspicion: This gent'man has a parlous head.â Mam. But wilt thou, Ulen, Be constant to thy promise? Face. As my life, Sir. Mam. And wilt thou insinuate what I am, and praise me, And say I am a noble fellow? Face. Oh, what else, Sir? And that you'll make her royal, with the Stone, An empress, and yourself King of Bantam. Mam. Wilt thou do this? Face. Will I, Sir! Mam. Lungs, my Lungs! I love thee. Face. Send your stuff, Sir, that my master May busy himself about projection. Mam. Th'hast witch'd me, rogue! Take, go. Face. Your jack and all, Sir. Mam. Thou art a villainâI will send my jack, And the weights too. âSlave, I could bite thine ear.â Away; thou dost not care for me. Face. Not I, Sir. Mam. Come, I was born to make thee, my good weasel; Set thee on a bench, and ha' thee twirl a chain With the best lord's vermin of them all. Face. Away, Sir. Mam. A count, nay, a count-palatineâ Face. Good Sir, go. Mam. Shall not advance thee better; no, nor faster. [Exit Mam. Enter Subtle and Dol. Sub. Has he bit? Has he bit? Face. And swallow'd too, my Subtle. I ha' given him line, and now he plays, i'faith. Sub. And shall we twitch him? Face. Thorough both the gills. A wench is a rare bait, âwith which a man âNo sooner's taken, but he straight firks mad.â Sub. Dol, my Lord What's 'hum's sister, you must now Bear yourself statelich. Dol. Oh, let me alone. I'll not forget my race, I warrant you. I'll keep my distance, laugh, and talk aloud: Have all the tricks of a proud scurvy lady, And be as rude as her woman. Face. Well said, Sanguine. Sub. But will he send his andirons? Face. His jack too; And's iron shoeing-horn: I ha' spoken to him. Well, I must not lose my wary gamester, yonder. Sub. Oh, Monsieur Caution, that will not be gull'd? Face. Ay; if I can strike a fine hook into him, now. The Temple-church, there I have cast mine angle. Well, pray for me; I'll about it. [One knocks. Sub. What, more gudgeons? Dol, scout, scout; stay, Face, you must go to the door. [Exit Face. Pray Heaven it be my Anabaptist. Who is't, Dol? Dol. I know him not. He looks like an end of gold and silver-man. Sub. God's-so! 'tis he; he said he would send What call you him? The sanctified elder, that should deal For Mammon's jack and andironsâLet him in. Stay, And help me off with my gownâAway, Madam, to your withdrawing chamber. Now, [Exit Dol. In a new tune, new gesture, but old language. This fellow is sent from one negociates with me About the Stone too; for the holy brethren âOf Amsterdam, the exil'd saints, that hope âTo raise their discipline by it.â I must use him âIn some strange fashion now, to make him admire me.â Enter Face and Ananias. Where is my drudge? Face. Sir. Sub. Take away the recipient, And rectify your menstrue from the phlegma. Then pour it o' the sol, in the cucurbite, And let them macerate together. Face. Yes, Sir; And save the ground? Sub. No; terra damnata Must not have entrance in the work. [Exit Face. Who are you? [To Ananias. Ana. A faithful brother, if it please you. Sub. What's that? âA Lullianist, a Ripley, filius artis? âCan you sublime and dulcify? Calcine? âKnow you the sapor pontic? Sapor flyptic?â Or what is homogene, or heterogene? Ana. I understand no heathen language, truly. Sub. Heathen, you knipper-doling! Is ars sacra, âOr chrysopeia, or spagyrica, âOr the pamphysick or panarchick knowledge,â A heathen language? Ana. Heathen Greek, I take it. Sub. How, heathen Greek! Ana. All's heathen but the Hebrew. Enter Face. Sub. Sirrah, my varlet, stand you forth, and speak to him Like a philosopher: answer i'the language, Name the vexations, and the martyrizations Of metals in the work. Face. Sir, putrefaction, Solution, ablution, sublimation, Cohobation, calcination, ceration, and Fixation. âSub. This is heathen Greek to you now. âAnd whence comes vivification? âFace. After mortification. âSub. What's cohobation? âFace. 'Tis the pouring on âYour aqua regis, and then drawing him off, âTo the trine circle of the seven spheres. âSub. What's the proper passion of metals? âFace. Malleation. âSub. What's your ultimum supplicium auri? âFace. Antimonium. âSub. This is heathen Greek to you. And what's your mercury? âFace. A very fugitive; he will begone, Sir. âSub. How know you him? âFace. By his viscosity, âHis oleosity, and his suscitability. âSub. How do you sublime him? âFace. With the calce of egg shells. âWhite marble, talc. âSub. Your magisterium, now? âWhat's that? âFace. Shifting, Sir, your elements, âDry into cold, cold into moist, moist into hot, hot into dry.â Ana. Oh, Oh!â Sub. This is heathen Greek to you still. What is Your lapis philosophicus? Face. 'Tis a stone, and not A stone; a spirit, a soul, and a body; Which if you do dissolve, it is dissolved; If you coagulate, it is coagulated; If you make it to fly, it flieth. Sub. Enough. [Exit Face. This is heathen Greek to youâ What are you, Sir? Ana. Please you, a servant of the exil'd brethren, That deal with widows and with orphans' goods, And make a just account unto the saints; A deacon. Sub. Oh, you are sent from Master Wholsome, Your teacher? Ana. From Tribulation Wholsome, Our very zealous pastor. Sub. Good. I have Some orphans' goods to come here. Ana. Of what kind, Sir? Sub. Pewter and brass, andirons, and kitchen-ware; Metals that we must use our med'cine on; Wherein the brethren may have a penn'orth, For ready money. âAna. Were the orphans' parents âSincere professors? âSub. Why do you ask? âAna. Because âWe then are to deal justly, and give (in truth) âTheir utmost value. âSub. 'Slid, you'ld cozen else, âAn if their parents were not of the faithful. âI will not trust you, now I think on't, â'Till I ha' talk'd with your pastor.â Ha' you brought money To buy more coals? Ana. No, surely. Sub. No! How so? Ana. The brethren bid me say unto you, Sir, Surely, they will not venture any more, 'Till they may see projection. Sub. How! Ana. You have had For the instrments, as bricks, and loam, and glasses, Already thirty pounds; and for materials, They say, some ninety more: and they have heard since, That one at Heidelberg, made it of an egg, And a small paper of pin dust. Sub. What's your name? Ana. My name is Ananias. Sub. Out, the varlet That cozen'd the apostles! Hence, away, Flee, mischief! Had your holy consistory No name to send me of another sound Than wicked Ananias? Send your elders Hither, to make atonement for you, quickly, And gi' me satisfaction; or out goes The fire, and down th'alembicks, and the furnace, âPiger Henricus, or what not. Thou wretch, âBoth Sericon and Buso shall be lost, âTell 'em. All hope of rooting out the bishops, âOr th'antichristian hierarchy, shall perish.â If they stay threescore minutes. The aqueity, Tereity, and sulphureity, Shall run together again, and all be annull'd, Thou wicked Ananias. [Exit Ananias. This will fetch 'em, And make 'em haste towards their gulling more. A man must deal like a rough nurse, and fright Those that are froward to an appetite. Enter Face and Drugger. Face. H'is busy with his spirits; but we'll upon him. Drug. Where are they? Face. Hush! Sub. How now? What mates, what baiards ha'we here? Face. I told you, he would be furious. Sir, here's Nab, Has brought y' another piece of gold to look on. (We must appease him. Give it me) and prays you, You would deviseâWhat is it, Nab? Drug. A sign, Sir. Face. Ay, a good lucky one; a thriving sign, Doctor. Sub. I was devising now. Face. 'Slight, do not say so; He will repent he gave you any more. [Aside to Sub. What say you to his constellation, Doctor? The Balance? Sub. No, that way is stale and common. A townsman, born in Taurus, gives the bull, Or the bull's head. In Aries, the ram; A poor device. Come hither, Abel. No, I will have his name Form'd in some mystic character, whose radii, Striking the senses of the passers-by, Shall, by a virtual influence, breed affections, That may result upon the party owns it: As thusâ Drug. I don't understand it. Face. Nab! Sub. He shall have a bell, that's Abel. Drug. And so it is. Sub. And by it standing one whose name is Dee, In a rug gown; there's D, and Rug, that's Drug; And right anenst him a dog snarling er; There's Drugger, Abel Drugger. Drug. My name! Sub. That's his sign. And here's now mystery and hieroglyphic! Face. Abel, thou art made. Drug. I do thank his worship. Face. Six o' thy legs more will not do it, Nab. What'st got there, Nab? Drug. A pipe of tobacco. Face. A pipe of tobacco! Give it me. He has brought you a pipe of tobacco, Doctor. Drug. Yes, SirâCaptain Face, Captain Face, your worship. Face. What dost say, Nab? Drug. I have another thing I would impartâ Face. Out with it, Nab. Drug. Sir, there is lodg'd hard by me, A rich young widowâ Face. Good; a bona roba! Drug. But nineteen at the most. Face. Very good, Abel. Drug. Marry, sh' is not in fashion yet; she wears A hood; but 't stands acop. Face. No matter, Abel. Drug. And I do now and then give her a fucus.â Face. What! dost deal, Nab? Sub. I did tell you, Captain. Drug. And physic too, sometimes, Sir; for which she trusts me With all her mind. She's come up here of purpose To learn the fashion. Face. Good; on, Nab. Drug. And she does strangely long to know her fortune. Face. God'slid, Nab, send her to the Doctor hither. Drug. Yes, I have spoke to her of his worship already: But she's afraid it will be blown abroad, And hurt her marriage. Face. Hurt it! 'Tis the way To heal it, if 'twere hurt; to make it more Follow'd and sought. Nab, thou shalt tell her this: She'll be more known, more talk'd of; and your widows Are ne'er of any price till they be famous. Their honour is the multitude of suitors. Send her, it may be thy good fortune. What, Thou dost not know? Drug. No, Sir, she'll never marry Under a knight. Her brother has made a vow. Face. What, and dost thou despair, my little Nab, Knowing what the Doctor has set down for thee, And seeing so many of the city dubb'd? âOne glass o' thy water, with a Madam, I know âWill have it done,â Nab. What's her brother? A knight? Drug. No, Sir, a gentleman, newly warm in his land, Sir. Scarce cold in his one-and-twenty,that does govern His sister here, and is a man himself Of some three thousand a year, and is come up To learn to quarrel, and to live by his wits, And will go down again, and die i' the country, When he can't live any longer here. Face. How! to quarrel? Drug. Yes, Sir, to carry quarrels, As gallants do; to manage them by line. Face. 'Slid, Nab, the Doctor is the only man In Christendom for him. Drug. Is he? Face. He has made a table, With mathematical demonstrations, Touching the art of quarrels. Drug. Has he? Face. He will give him An instrument to quarrel by. Drug. Will he? Face. Go, bring 'em both, Him and his sister. And for thee, with her The Doctor haply may persuade. Go to. Sha't give his worship a new damask suit Upon the premisses. Sub. Oh, good Captainâ Face. He shall: He is the honestest fellow, DoctorâStay not; No offers; bring the damask and the parties. Drug. I'll try my power, Sir. Face. And thy will too, Nab. Sub. 'Tis good tobacco, this. What is't a pound? Drug. I'll fell your worship a hogshead of it. Face. He'll send you a hogshead, Doctor. [Abel runs out, and Face brings him back. Sub. Oh no! Face. He will do't: It is the goodest soulâAbel, about it. Thou shalt know more anon. Away, begone. Drug. I'll give him a pound.âI'll give him two pound. [Exit. Face. A miserable rogue, and lives with cheese, And has the worms. That was the cause, indeed, Why he came now. He dealt with me in private, To get a med'cine for them. Sub. And shall, Sir. This works. Face. A wife, a wife for one of us, my dear Subtle: We'll e'en draw lots, âand he that fails shall have âThe more in goods, the other has in tail.â But Dol must ha' no breath on't. Sub. Mum. Away you to your Surly, yonder; catch him. Face. Pray Heaven, I ha' not staid too long. Sub. I fear it. [Exeunt. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Tribulation and Ananias. Tribulation. These chastisements are common to the saints; And such rebukes we of the separation Must bear with willing shoulders, as the trials Sent forth to tempt our frailties. Ana. In pure zeal, I do not like the man. He is a heathen, And speaks the language of Canaan, truly. Trib. I think him a prophane person, indeed. âAna. He bears âThe visible mark of the beast in his forehead, âAnd for his stone, it is a work of darkness, âAnd with philosophy blinds the eyes of man. âTrib. Good brother, we must bend unto all means âThat may give furtherance to the holy cause. âAna. Which his cannot: the sanctified cause âShould have a sanctified course. âTrib. Not always necessary: âThe children of perdition are oft-times âMade instruments even of the greatest works. âBeside we should give somewhat to man's nature, âThe place he lives in, still about the fire, âAnd fume of metals, that intoxicate âThe brain of man, and make him prone to passion. âWhere have you greater atheists than your cooks? âOr more profane, or choleric, than your glassmen? âMore antichristian than your bell-founders? âWhat makes the devil so devilish, I would ask you, âSatan, our common enemy, but his being âPerpetually about the fire, and boiling âBrimstone and arsenick? âYou did ill to upbraid him âWith the brethrens' blessing of Heidelberg, weighing âWhat need we have to hasten on the work, âFor the restoring of the silenc'd saints, âWhich ne'er will be, but by the philosopher's stone: âAnd so a learned elder, one of Scotland, âAssured me. âAna. I have not edified more, truly, by man, âNot since the beautiful light first shone on me. âAnd I am sad my zeal hath so offended.â Tri. Let us call on him then. Ana. The motion's good, And of the spirit; I will knock first. Peace be within. Enter Subtle. Sub. Oh, are you come? 'Twas time. Your threescore minutes Were at the last thread, you see, âand down had gone âFurnus acediÃ¦, turris circulatorius: âLembeck, bolts-head, retort, and pellicane âHad all been cinders.â Wicked Ananias! Art thou return'd? Nay, then it goes down yet. Trib. Sir, be appeased; he is come to humble Himself in spirit, and to ask your patience, If too much zeal hath carried him aside From the due path. Sub. Why, this doth qualify. Trib. The brethren had no purpose, verily, To give you the least grievance; but are ready To lend their willing hands to any project The spirit and you direct. Sub. This qualifies more. Trib. And for the orphans' goods, let them be valu'd, Or what is needful else to the holy work, It shall be number'd. Here, by me, the saints Throw down their purse before you. Sub. This qualifies most! Why, thus it should be; now you understand. Have I discoursed so unto you of our Stone, âAnd of the good that it shall bring your cause? âShew'd you, âThat even the med'cinal use should make you a faction âAnd party in the realm? As put the case âThat some great man in state, he have the gout; âWhy, you but send three drops of your elixir, âYou help him straight; there you have made a friend. âAnother has the palsy, or the dropsy, âHe takes of your incombustible stuff, âHe's young again: there you have made a friend. âA lady that is past the feat of body, âTho' not of mind, and hath her face decay'd âBeyond all cure of paintings, you restore âWith the oil of talck; there you have made a friend, âAnd all her friends. âStill you increase your friends. âTrib. Ay, 'tis very pregnant. âSub. And then the turning of his lawyer's pewter âTo plate at Candlemas. âAna. Candle-tide, I pray you. âSub. Yet, Ananias? âAna. I have done. âSub.â Oh, but the Stone! all's idle to't; nothing! Nature's miracle, The divine secret, that doth fly in clouds From east to west; and whose tradition Is not from men, but spirits. Ana. I hate traditions: I do not trust themâ Trib. Peace. Ana. They are popish, all. I will not peace. I will notâ Trib. Ananias. Ana. Please the profane, to grieve the godly. I may not. Sub. Well, Ananias, thou shalt overcome. Tri. It is an ignorant zeal that haunts him, Sir: But, truly, else, a very faithful brother; A botcher, and a man, by revelation, That hath a competent knowledge of the truth. Sub. Has he a competent sum there i' the bag, To buy the goods within? I am made guardian, And must, for charity and conscience sake, Now see the most be made for my poor orphans: âTho' I desire the brethren too, good gainers.â There they are within. When you have view'd and bought 'em, And ta'en the inventory of what they are, They are ready for projection; there's no more To do; cast on the med'cine, so much silver As there is tin there, so much gold as brass, I'll gi't you in by weight. âTrib. But how long time, âSir, must the saints expect yet? âSub. Let me seeâ âHow's the moon now?âEight, nine, ten days hence, âHe will be silver potate; then three days âBefore he citronise: some fifteen days âThe magisterium will be perfected. âAna. About the second day of the third week âIn the ninth month? âSub. Yes, my good Ananias.â Trib. What will the orphans' goods arise to, think you? Sub. Some hundred marks; as much as fill'd three cars Unladed now; you'll make six millions of them. But I must ha' more coals laid in. âTrib. How! âSub. Another load, âAnd then we have finish'd. We must now increase âOur fire to ignis ardens; we are past âFimus equinus, balnei cineris, âAnd all those lenter heats. If the holy purse âShould with this draught fall low,â and that the saints Do need a present sum, I have a trick To melt the pewter you shall buy now, instantly, And with a tincture make you as good Dutch dollars As any are in Holland. Trib. Can you so? Sub. Ay, and shall 'bide the third examination. Ana. It will be joyful tidings to the brethren. Sub. But you must carry it secret. Trib. Ay; but stay: This act of coining, is it lawful? Ana. Lawful! We know no magistrate; or if we did, This's foreign coin. Sub. It is no coining, Sir; It is but casting. Trib. Ha! you distinguish well: Casting of money may be lawful. Ana. 'Tis, Sir. Trib. Truly, I take it so. Sub. There is no scruple, Sir to be made of it: believe Ananias; This case of conscience he is studied in. Trib. I'll make a question of it to the brethren. âAna. The brethren shall approve it lawful, doubt not. âWhere shall it be done?â Sub. âFor that we'll talk anon.â [Knock without. There's some to speak with me. Go in, I pray you, And view the parcels. That's the inventory. I'll come to you straight. [Exeunt Trib. and Ana.] Who is it? Face! Appear. Enter Face. How now? Good Prize? Face. Good pox! Yond' costive cheater Never came on. Sub. How then? Face. I ha' walk'd the round Till now, and no such thing. Sub. And ha' you quit him? Face. Quit him! an' hell would quit him too, he were happy. 'Slight! would you have me stalk like a mill-jade All day, for one that will not yield us grains? I know him of old. Sub. Oh, but to ha' gull'd him, Had been a mastery Face. Let him go, black boy! And turn thee, that some fresh news may possess thee. A noble Count, a Don of Spain, Furnish'd with pistolets and pieces of eight, Will straight be here, my rogue, to have thy bath, (That is the colour) and to make his batt'ry Upon our Dol, our castle, our cinque-port, Our Dover-pier, our what thou wilt. Where is the doxy? Sub. I will send her to thee; And but dispatch my brace of little John Leydens, And come again myself. Face. Are they within then? Sub. Numb'ring the sum. Face. How much? Sub. A hundred marks, boy. [Exit. Face. Why, this's a lucky day! Ten pounds of Mammon; Three o' my clerk; a portague o' my grocer; This o' the brethren; beside reversions, And 'states to come i' the widow, and my Count.

This dear hour A dainty Don is taken with my Dol; And thou may'st make his ransom what thou wilt, My Dousabel. Dol. What is he, General? Face. An Adalantado, A Grande, girl. Was not my Dapper here yet? Dol. No. Face. Nor my Drugger? Dol. Neither. Face. A pox on them! They are so long a furnishing! Enter Subtle. How now? Ha' you done? Sub. Done! They are gone. The sum Is here in bank, my Face. I would we knew Another chapman now would buy 'em out-right. Face. 'Slid, Nab shall do't against he ha' the widow, To furnish houshold. Sub. Excellent well thought on. Pray Heaven he come. Face. I pray he keep away, Till our new business be o'erpast. Sub. But, Face, How cam'st thou by this secret Don? Face. A spirit Brought me th'intelligence in a paper here, As I was conjuring yonder in my circle For Surly, âI ha' my flies abroad. Your bath âIs famous, Subtle, by my means. Sweet Dol, âYou must go tune your virginal; no losing âO' the least time. And do you hear?â His great Verdugoship has not a jot of language: So much the easier to be cozen'd, my Dolly; He will come here in a hired coach, obscure, And our own coachman, whom I have sent to guide, No creature else. Who's that? [One knocks. Sub. It is not he! Face. Oh, no, not yet, this hour. Sub. Who is't? Dol. Dapper, Your clerk. Face. God's will! then, Queen of Fairy, On with your tire; and, Doctor, with your robes. Let's dispatch him, for God's sake. Sub. 'Twill be long. Face. I warrant you; take but the cues I give you, It shall be brief enough. 'Slight, here are more! Abel, and, I think, the angry boy, the heir, That fain would quarrel. Sub. And the widow? Face. No; Not that I see. Away. [Exeunt Sub. and Dol. Oh, Sir, you are welcome! Enter Dapper, Drugger, and Kastril. The Doctor is within, moving for you. âI have had the most ado to win him to it. âHe swears you'll be the darling of the dice. âHe never heard her Highness doat till now, he says: âYour aunt has giv'n you the most gracious words âThat can be thought on.â Dap. Shall I see her Grace? Face. See her, and kiss her tooâWhat, honest Nab! Hast brought the damask? Drug. No, Sir, here's tobacco. Face. 'Tis well done, Nab. Thou'lt bring the damask too? Drug. Yes. Here's the gentleman, Captain; Master Kastril, I have brought to see the Doctor. Face. Where's the widow? [Whispers. Drug. Sir, as he likes, his sister (he says) shall come. Face. Oh, is it so? Drug. I'll introduce him. Master Kastril, Captain Face. Face. Good time. Is your name Kastril, Sir? Kas. Ay, and the best of the Kastrils; I'ld be sorry else, By fifteen hundred a year. Where is the Doctor? My mad tobacco-boy, here, tells me of one That can do things. Has he any skill? Face. Wherein, Sir? Kas. To carry a business, manage a quarrel fairly, Upon fit terms. Face. It seems, Sir, y'are but young About the town, that can make that a question. Kas. Sir, not so young, but I have heard some speech Of the angry boys, and seen them take tobacco, And in his shop; and I can take it too: And I would fain be one of them, and go down And practise i' the country. Face. Sir, for the duello, The Doctor, I assure you, shall inform you, To the least shadow of a hair; and then, rules To give and take the lie by. Kas. How! to take it? Face. Yes, in oblique he'll shew you, or in circle, But never in diameter. âThe whole town âStudy his theorems, and dispute them ordinarily âAt the eating academies. âKas. But does he teach âLiving by the wits too? âFace. Any thing whatever. âYou cannot think that subtilty but he reads it. âHe made me a captain. I was a stark pimp, âJust o' your standing, fore I met with him: â'Tis not two months since.â I'll tell you his method: First, he will enter you at some ordinary. Kas. No, I'll not come there. You shall pardon me. Face. For why, Sir? Kas. There's gaming there, and tricks. Face. Why, would you be A gallant, and not game? Kas. Ay; 'twill spend a man. Face. Spend you! It will repair you when you are spent. How do they live by their wits there, that have vented Six times your fortune? Kas. What, three thousand a year? Face. Ay, forty thousand. âKas. Are there such? âFace. Ay, Sir. âAnd gallants yet.â Here's a young gentleman Is born to nothing, forty marks a year, Which I count nothing. He is to be initiated, And have a fly o' the Doctor. He will win you, By unresistible luck, within this fortnight, Enough to buy a barony. Kas. Do you not gull one? Face. 'Ods my life! do you think it? Why, Nab here knows it. Drug. Yes; what is it? Face. And then for making matches for rich widows, Young gentlewomen, heirs, the fortunat'st man! He's sent to, far and near, all over England, To have his counsel, and to know their fortunes. Kas. Adzooks! my suster shall see him Face. I'll tell you, Sir, What he did tell me of Nab. Drug. Ay; what is it? Face. It's a strange thing; (By the way, you must eat no cheese, Nab; it breeds melancholy, And that same melancholy breeds worms) but pass it; He told me, honest Nab here was ne'er at tavern But once in's life! Drug. Truth, and no more I was not. Face. And then he was so sickâ Drug. Could he tell you that too? Face. How should I know it? Drug. In troth, I'll tell you the whole story. We had been a shooting, And had a piece of fat ram-mutton to supper, That lay so heavy o' my stomachâ Face. And he has no headâ Drug. No, I have no head. Face. To bear any wine: for what with the noise of the fidlers, And care of his shop; for he dares keep no servantâ Drug. My head did so achâ Face. As he was fain to be brought home, The Doctor told me. And then a good old womanâ Drug. (Yes, faith, she dwells in Sea-coal-lane) did cure me With sodden ale, and pellitory o' the wall; Cost me but twopence. I had another sickness, Was worse than thatâ Face. Ay, that was the grief Thou took'st for being 'sess'd at eighteen-pence, For the water-work. Drug. In truth, and it was like T'have cost me almost my life. Face. Thy hair went off. Drug. Yes, and it has never been very good since 'Twas done for spite. Face. Nay, so says the Doctor. Kas. Pray thee, tobacco-boy, go fetch my suster; I'll see this learned boy before I go; And so shall she. Face. Sir, he is busy now; But if you have a sister to fetch hither, Perhaps your own pains may command her sooner And he by that time will be free. Kas. I go. Face. Drugger, she's thineâthe damask. [Ex. Drug. and Kastril.] Subtle and I Must wrestle for her. [Aside.] Come on, Master Dapper; You see how I turn clients here away, To give your cause dispatch. Ha' you perform'd The ceremonies were enjoin'd you? Dap. Yes, o' the vinegar, And the clean shirt. Face. 'Tis well; that shirt may do you More worship than you think. âYour aunt's a-fire, âBut that she will not shew it, t'have a sight o' you. Ha' you provided for her Grace's servants? Dap. Yes, here are six-score Edward's shillings. Face. Good. Dap. And an old Harry's sovereign. Face. Very good. Dap. And three James's shillings, and an Elizabeth groat; Just twenty nobles. Face. Oh, you are too just! I would you had the other noble in Mary's. Dap. I have some Philip and Mary's. Face. Ay, those same Are best of all. Where are they; Hark! the Doctor. Enter Subtle. Sub. Is yet her Grace's cousin come? Face. He is come. Sub. And is he fasting? Face. Yes. Sub. And hath cry'd hum? Face. Thrice, you must answer. Dap. Thrice. Sub. And as oft, buz? Face. If you have, say. Dap. I have. Sub. Then, to her cuz, Hoping that he hath vinegar'd his senses, As he was bid, the Fairy Queen dispenses, By me, this robe, the petticoat of Fortune; Which that he straight put on, she doth importune, And though to Fortune near be her petticoat, Yet nearer is her smock, the Queen doth note: And therefore, even of that a piece she has sent, Which, being a child, to wrap him in was rent; And prays him, for a scarf he now will wear it (With as much love as then her Grace did tear it) About his eyes, to shew he is fortunate. [They blind him with a rag. And, trusting unto her to make his state, He'll throw away all worldly pelf about him; Which that he will perform she doth not doubt him. Face. She need not doubt him, Sir. Alas, he has nothing But what he will part withal as willingly, Upon her Grace's word (throw away your purse.) As she would ask it. (âHandkerchiefs and all.)â She cannot bid that thing, but he'll obey. If you have a ring about you, cast it off, Or a silver seal at your wrist: her Grace will send Her fairies here to search you; therefore deal Directly with her highness. If they find That you conceal a mite, your are undone, [He throws away, as they bid him. Dap. Truly, there's all. Face. All what? Dap. My money, truly. Face. Keep nothing that is transitory about you. Look, the elves are come To pinch you, if you tell not truth. Advise you. Dap. Oh, I have a paper with a spur-ryal in't. Face. Ti, ti. They knew it, they say. Sub. Ti, ti, ti, ti, he has more yet. âFace. Ti, ti-ti-ti. I' the other pocket? âDap. Oh, Oh. âFace. Nay, pray you hold. He is her Grace's nephew. âTi, ti, ti? What care you? Good faith, you shall care. âDeal plainly, Sir, and shame the fairies. Shew âYou are an innocent.â Dap. By this good light, I ha' nothing But a half-crown Of gold, about my wrist, that my love gave me; And a leaden heart I wore sin' she forsook me. Face. I thought 'twas something. And would you incur Your aunt's displeasure for these trifles? Come, I had rather you had thrown away twenty half-crowns, You may wear your leaden heart still. [Knock.] How now Enter Dol. Sub. What news, Dol? Dol. Yonder's your knight, Sir Mammon. Face. God's lid, we never thought of him till now. Where is he? Dol. Here, hard by. He's at the door. Sub. And you are not ready now. Dol. He must be sent back. Face. Oh, by no means. What shall we do with this same puffing here, Now he's o' the spit? Sub. Why, lay him back awhile, With some device. Ti, ti, ti, ti, ti. Would her Grace speak with me? [Knock. I come, Help, Dol. Face. Who's there? Sir Epicure. [He speaks through the key-hole, the other knocking. My master's i' the way. Please you to walk Three or four turns, but till his back be turn'd, And I am for you. Quickly, Dol. [Exit Dol. Sub. Her Grace Commends her kindly to you, master Dapper. Dap. I long to see her Grace. Sub. She now is set At dinner in her bed, and she has sent you From her own private trencher, a dead mouse, And a piece of gingerbread, to be merry withal, And stay your stomach, lest you faint with fasting: Yet if you could hold out till she saw you (she says) It would be better for you. Face. Sir, he shall Hold out an' 'twere this two hours, for her highness; I can assure you that. We will not lose All we ha' doneâ Sub. He must not see, nor speak To any body, till then. Face. For that we'll put, Sir, A stay in's mouth. Sub. Of what? Face. Of gingerbread. Make you it fit. âHe that hath pleas'd her Grace âThus far, shall not now crinkle for a little.â Gape, Sir, and let him fit you. Sub. Where shall we now Bestow him? Dol. I' the privy. Sub. Come along, Sir, I now must shew you fortune's privy lodgings. Face. Are they perfum'd, and his bath ready? Sub. All. Only the fumigation's somewhat strong. âFace.

I ha' told her such brave things o'you, Touching your bounty, and your noble spiritâ Mam. Hast thou? Face. As she is almost in her fit to see you.

Is't not French? Face. No, Spanish, Sir. Kas. It goes like law-French; And that, they say, is the courtliest language. Face. List, Sir. Sur. Vulga me dios. Face. He admires your sister. Kas. Must not she make a curtsy? Sub. Od's will, she must go to him, man, and kiss him! It is the Spanish fashion for the women To make first court. Sir? Sur. Por el amor de dios, que es esto, que se tarda? Kas. Nay, see; she will not understand him! Gull! Noddy! Pli. What say you, brother? Kass. Ass, my suster! Go kuss him, as the cunning man would ha' you; I'll thrust a pin i' your buttocks else. Face. Oh, no, Sir. Sur. Sennora, si sera servida, entremus. Kas. Where does he carry her? [Exeunt Sur. and Plyant. Face. Into the garden, Sir; Take you no thought; I must interpret for her. Sub. Give Dol the word. [Exit Face.] Come, my fierce child, advance. We'll to our quarrelling lesson again. Kas. Agreed. I love a Spanish boy with all my heart. Sub. Nay, by this means, Sir, you shall be brother To a great count. Kas. Ay, I knew that at first. This match will advance the house of the Kastrils. Sub. Pray God your sister prove but pliant. Kas. Why, Her name is so, by her other husband. Sub. How! Kas. The widow Pliant. Knew you not that? Sub. âNo, faith, Sir. âYet, by erection of her figure, I guess'd it.â Yes, yes, I knew it by my art. Come, let's go practise. Kas. Yes; but do you think, Doctor, I e'er shall quarrel well? Sub. I warrant you. Kast. Damme, you lie. [Exeunt. SCENE, another Apartment. Enter Dol and Mammon. Dol. For, after Alexander's deathâ [In her fit of talking. Mam. Good Ladyâ Dol. That Perdiccas and Antigonus were slain, The two that stood, Seleuc' and Ptolmeeâ Mam. Madam. Dol. Made up the two legs, and the fourth beast, That was Gog-north, and Egypt-south; which after Was call'd Gog-iron-leg, and South-iron-legâ Mam. Laâ Dol. And then Gog-horned. So was Egypt, too. Then Egypt-clay-leg, and Gog-clay-leg. Mam. Sweet Madam. Dol. And last Gog-dust, and Egypt-dust, which fall In the last link of the fourth chain. And these Be stars in story, which none see or look atâ Mam. What shall I do? Dol. For, as he says, except We call the rabins, and the heathen Greeksâ Mam. Dear Lady. Dol. To come from Salem, and from Athens, And teach the people of Great-Britainâ Enter Face. Face. What's the matter, Sir. Dol. To speak the tongue of Eber and Javanâ Mam. Oh, she's in her fit. Dol. We shall know nothingâ Face. Death, Sir, We are undone. My master will hear! âDol. A wisdom, which Pythagoras held most highâ âMam. Sweet honourable Lady. âDol. To comprize âAll sounds of voices in few marks of lettersâ âFace. Nay, you must never hope to lay her now. âDol. And so we may arrive by Talmud skill, âAnd profane Greek, to raise the building up âOf Helen's house against the Ismaelite, âKing of Thogarma, and his Habergions âBrimstony, blue, and fiery; and the force âOf King Abaddon, and the beast of Cittim, âWhich Rabbi David Kimchi, Omkelos, âAnd Aben Ezra do interpret Rome. âFace. How did you put her into't? âMam. Alas, I talk'd âOf a fifth monarchy I would erect, â[They speak together. âWith the Philosopher's Stone (by chance) and she âFalls on the other four straight. âFace. Out of Broughton. âI told you so. 'Slid, stop her mouth. âMam. Is't best? âFace. She'll never leave else. If the old man hear her, âWe are but fÃ¦ces, ashes.â Sub. [Within.] What's to do there? Face. Oh, we are lost. Now she hears him, she is quiet. Mam. Where shall I hide me? [Upon Subtle's entry they disperse. Sub. How, what sight is here! Close deeds of darkness, and that shun the light! Bring him again; who is he?âWhat, my son! Oh, I have liv'd too long. Mam. Nay, good, dear father, There was no unchaste purpose. Sub. No? and flee me When I come in? Mam. That was my error. Sub. Error? Guilt, guilt, my son. Give it the right name. No marvel If I found check in our great work within, When such affairs as these were managing! Mam. Why, have you so? Sub. It has stood still this half hour; And all the rest of our less works gone back. Where is the instrument of wickedness, My lewd false drudge? Mam. Nay, good Sir, blame not him; Believe me, 'twas against his will, or knowledge. I saw her by chance. Sub. Will you commit more sin, T'excuse a varlet? Mam. By my hope, 'tis true, Sir. Sub. Nay, then I wonder less, if you for whom The blessing was prepar'd, would so tempt Heaven; And lose your fortunes. Mam. Why, Sir? Sub. This 'll retard The work, a month at least. Mam. Why, if it do, What remedy? but think it not, good father: Our purposes were honest. Sub. As they were, So the reward will prove. [A great crack and noise within.] How now! Ay me. God, and all saints be good to us! What's that? Face. Oh, Sir, we are defeated: all the works Are flown in fumo: Retorts, receivers, pellicanes, bolt-heads, All struck in shivers! Help, good Sir! alas! [Subtle falls down as in a swoon. Coldness and death invades him. Nay, Sir Mammon, Do the fair office of a man! You stand, As you were readier to depart than he. [One knocks. Who's there? My Lord, her brother is come. Mam. Ha, Lungs? Face. His coach is at the door. Avoid his fight, For he's as furious as his sister is mad. [One knocks. Mam. Alas! Face. My brain is quite undone with the fume, Sir. I ne'er must hope to be mine own man again. Mam. Is all lost, Lungs? Will nothing be preserv'd, Of all our cost? Face. Faith, very little, Sir: A peck of coals or so, which is cold comfort, Sir. Mam. Oh, my vuluptuous mind! I'm justly punish'd. Face. And so am I, Sir. Mam. Cast from all my hopesâ Face. Nay, certainties, Sir. Mam. By mine own base affections. Sub. Oh, the curs'd fruits of vice and lust! [Subtle seems to come to himself. Mam. Good father, It was my sin. Forgive it. Sub. Hangs my roof Over us still, and will not fall, Oh, justice! Upon us, for this wicked man? Face. Nay, look, Sir, You grieve him now with staying in his sight: Good Sir, the nobleman will come too, and take you, And that may breed a tragedy. Mam. I'll go. Face. Ay, and repent at home, Sir. It may be, For some good penance you may have it yet; A hundred pounds to the box at Bethlem. Mam. Yes. Face. For the restoring such as ha' lost their wits. Mam. I'll do't. Face. I'll send one to you to receive it. Mam. Do. Is no projection left? Face. All flown, or stinks, Sir. Mam. Will nought be sav'd that's good for med'cine, think'st thou? Face. I cannot tell, Sir. There will be, perhaps, Something, about the scraping of the shards, Will cure the itch: It shall be sav'd for you, and sent home. Good Sir, This way, for fear the lord should meet you. [Exit Mam. Sub. Face. Face. Ay. Sub. Is he gone? Face. Yes, and as heavily As all the gold he hop'd for were in his blood. Let us be light though. Sub. Ay, as balls, and bound And hit our heads against the roof for joy: There's so much of our care now cast away. Face. Now to our Don. Sub. Yes, your young widow, by this time, Is made a countess. She's now in travail Of a young heir for you. Face. Good, Sir. Sub. Off with your case, And greet her kindly, as a bridegroom should, After these common hazards. Face. Very well, Sir. Will you go fetch Don Diego off the while? Sub. And fetch him over too, if you'll be pleas'd, Sir. Would Dol were in her place, to pick his pockets now. Face. Why, you can dot it as well, if you would set to't. I pray you prove your virtue. Sub. For your sake, Sir. [Exeunt. SCENE, the Alchymist's Room. Enter Surly and Dame Pliant. Sur. Lady, you see into what hands you are fall'n! 'Mongst what a nest of villains! and how near Your honour was t'have catch'd a certain ruin (Through your credulity) âhad I but been âSo punctually forward as place, time, âAnd other circumstances, would ha' made a man: âFor yo'are a handsome woman, would you were wise too.â I am a gentleman come here disguis'd, Only to find the knaveries of this citadel, And where I might ha' wrong'd your honour, and ha' not, I claim some interest in you love. Your are, They say, a widow, rich; and I am a batchelor, Worth nought: your fortunes may make me a man, As mine ha' preserv'd you a woman. Think upon it, And whether I have deserv'd you, or no. Pli. I will, Sir. Sur. And for these houshold-rogues, let me alone To treat with them. Enter Subtle. Sub. How doth my noble Diego? And my dear Madam Countess? Hath the Count Been courteous, Lady? liberal, and open? Donsel, methinks you look melancholic After your coicum, and scurvy! Truly, I do not like the dullness of your eye, It hath a heavy cast; 'tis Upsee-Dutch, And says you are a lumpish whore-master. Be lighter; I will make your pockets so. [He falls to picking of them. Sur. Will you, Don bawd, and pick-purse? How now? Reel you? Stand up, Sir; you shall find, since I am so heavy, I'll give you equal weight. Sub. Help, murder! Sur. No, Sir, there's no such thing intended. A good cart, And a clean whip, shall ease you of that fear. I am the Spanish Don, that should be cozen'd, Do you see? Cozen'd! Where's your Captain Face? Enter Face. Face. How, Surly! Sur. Oh, make your approach, good Captain. I have found from whence your copper rings and spoons Come now, wherewith you cheat abroad in taverns. And this doctor, âYour sooty, smoaky-bearded compeer, heâ Will close you so much gold in a bolt's head, [Face steals off. And on a turn, convey (i' the stead) another With sublim'd mercury, that shall burst i' the heat, And fly out all in fumo? What is he gone? Nay, Sir, you must tarry, Tho' he be 'scap'd, and answer by the ears, Sir. Enter Face and Kastril. Face. Why, now's the time, if ever you will quarrel Well, (as they say) and be a true-born child. The Doctor and your sister both are abus'd. Kas. Where is he? Which is he? He is a slave, Whate'er he is, and the son of a whore. Are you The man, Sir, I would know? Sur. I should be loth, Sir, To confess so much. Kas. Then you lie i' your throat. Sur. How! Face. A very arrant rogue, Sir, and a cheater, Employ'd here by another conjurer, That does not love the Doctor, and would cross him, If he knew howâ Sur. Sir, you are abus'd. Kas. You lie: And 'tis no matter. Face. Well said, Sir. He is The impudent'st rascalâ Sur. You are indeed! Will you hear me, Sir? Face. By no meansâBid him begone. Kas. Begone, Sir, quickly. Sur. This's strange! Lady, do you inform your brother. Face. There is not such a foist in all the town: The Doctor had him presently; and finds yet, The Spanish Count will come here. Bear up, Subtle. Sub. Yes, Sir, he must appear within this hour. Face. And yet this rogue will come in a disguise, By the temptation of another spirit, To trouble our art, tho' he could not hurt it. Kas. Ay, I knowâAway; you talk like a foolish mouther. Sur. Sir, all is truth, she says. Face. Do not believe him, Sir. He is the lying'st swabber! Come your ways, Sir. Sur. You are valiant out of company. Kas. Yes. How then, Sir? Enter Drugger. Face. Nay, here's an honest fellow too, that knows him, And all his tricksâMake good what I say, Abel; This cheater would ha' cozen'd thee o' the widow. [To Ab He owes this honest Drugger, here, seven pounds, He has had on him in two-penn'orths of tobacco. Drug. Yes, Sir; and he has damn'd himself three Terms to pay me. Face. And what does he owe for lotium? Drug. Thirty shillings, Sir. And for six syringes. Sur. Hydra of villainy! Face. Nay, Sir, you must quarrel him out o' the house. Kas. I will. Sir, if you get not out o' doors, you lie; And you are a pimp. Sur. Why, this is madness, Sir, Not valour in you. I must laugh at this. Kas. It is my humour. You are a pimp, and a trig. And an Amadis de Gaul, or a Don Quixote. Drug. Or a Knight o' the Curious Coxcomb, do you see? Enter Ananias. Ana. Peace to the houshold. Kas. I'll keep peace for no man. Ana. Casting of dollars is concluded lawful. Kas. Is he the constable? Sub. Peace, Ananias. Face. No, Sir. Kas. Then you are an otter, and a shad, a whit, A very Tim. Sur. You'll hear me, Sir? Kas. I will not. Ana. What is the motive? Sub. Zeal in the gentlemen, Against his Spanish slops. Ana. They are prophane, Lewd, superstitious, and idolatrous breeches. Sur. New rascals! Kas. Will you begone, Sir? Ana. Avoid, Satan. Thou art not of the light. That ruff of pride About thy neck, betrays thee, and is the same With that which the unclean birds, in seventy-seven, Were seen to prank it with on divers coasts. Thou look'st like Antichrist, in the lewd hat. Sur. I must give way. Kas. Begone, Sir. Sur. But I'll take a course with you. Ana. Depart, proud, Spanish fiend. Sur. Captain and Doctorâ Ana. Child of perdition! Kas. Hence, Sir. [They fight. Exit Surly. Did I not quarrel bravely? Face. Yes, indeed, Sir. Kas. Nay, an I give my mind to't, I shall do't. Drug. Well, and how did I? Face. Very well; But you must follow, Sir, and threaten him tame; He'll turn again else. Kas. I'll return him then. Face. Drugger, this rogue prevented us; for thee, We had determin'd that thou shouldst ha' come In a Spanish suit, and ha' carried her so; and he, A brokerly slave, goes, puts it on himself. Hast brought the damask? Drug. Yes, Sir. Face. Thou must borrow A Spanish suit. Hast thou no credit with the players? Drug. Yes, Sir. Did you never see me play the fool? Face. Thou shalt, if I can help it. Hieronymo's old cloak, ruff, and hat will serve: [Subtle hath whispered him this while. I'll tell thee more when thou bring'st them. Drug. Did not I behave well? Will you begone?âHe won't be here In a hurry, I believe. [Exit. Ana. Sir, I know The Spaniard hates the brethren, and hath spies Upon their actions:â âand that this was one, âI make no scruple. But the holy synod âHave been in prayer and meditation for it.â And 'tis reveal'd no less to them than me, That casting of money is most lawful. Sub. True; But here I cannot do it. If the house Should chance to be suspected, all would out, And we be lock'd up in the Tower for ever, To make gold there for the state; never come out; And then you are defeated. Ana. I will tell This to the elders, and the weaker brethren, That the whole company of the Separation May join in humble prayer again. Sub. And fasting. Ana. Yea, for some fitter place. The peace of mind Rest with these walls. [Exit. Sub. Thanks, courteous Ananias. Face. What did he come for? Sub. About casting dollars, Presently out of hand. And so I told him, A Spanish minister came here to spy Against the faithful. Face. I conceive. Come, Subtle, Thou art so down upon the least disaster! How wouldst thou ha' done, if I had not help'd thee out? Sub. I thank thee, Face, for the angry boy, i'faith. Face. Who would ha' look'd it should ha' been that rascal, Surly? Well, Sir, Here's damask come to make you a suit. Sub. Where's Drugger? Face. He's gone to borrow me a Spanish habit. I'll be the Count now. Sub. But where's the widow? Face. Within, with my Lord's sister: Madam Dol Is entertaining her. Sub. By your favour, Face; Now she is honest, I will stand again. Face. You will not offer it? Sub. Why? Face. Stand to your word, Orâhere comes Dol; she knowsâ Sub. Y' are tyrannous still. Face. Strict for my right. [Enter Dol. How now, Dol? Hast told her The Spanish Count will come? Dol. Yes; but another is come You little look'd for. Face. Who's that? Dol. Your master; The master of the house. Sub. How, Dol! Face. She lies. This is some trick. Come, leave your quibblings, Dorothy. Dol. Look out and see. Sub. Art thou in earnest? Dol. 'Slight! Forty o' the neighbours are about him, talking. Face. 'Tis he, by this good day. Dol. 'Twill prove an ill day For some of us. Face. We are undone, and taken. Dol. Lost, I'm afraid. Sub. You said he would not come While there died one a week, within the liberties. Face. No; 'twas within the walls. Sub. What shall we do now, Face? Face. Be silent; not a word, if he call or knock. I'll into mine old shape again, and meet him, Of Jeremy the butler. I' the mean time, Do you two pack up all the goods and purchase, That we can carry i' the two trunks. I'll help him Off for to-day, if I cannot longer; and then, At night, I'll ship you both away to Ratcliff, Where we'll meet to-morrow, and there we'll share. Let Mammon's brass and pewter keep the cellarâ We'll have another time for that. [Exeunt. End of the Fourth Act.</field>

I heard him, and you tooâHe's undone, thenâ I have been fain to say the house is haunted With spirits, to keep Churl back. Sub. And hast thou done it? Face. Sure, for this night. Sub. Why, then triumph and sing Of Face so famous, the precious king Of present wits. Face. Did you not hear the coil About the door? Sub. Yes, and I dwindled with it. Face.

Soon at night, my Dolly, When we are shipp'd, and all our goods aboard, Eastward for Ratcliff, we will turn our course To Brainford, westward, if thou say'st the word, And take our leave of this o'erweening rascal, This peremptory Face. Dol. Content; I'm weary of him. Sub. We'll tickle it at the Pigeons, When we have all, and may unlock the trunks, And say, this's mine and thine, and thine and mine. [They kiss. Enter Face. Face. What now, a billing? Sub. Yes, a little exalted, In the good passage of our stock affairs. âFace. Drugger has brought his parson; take him in, Subtle, âAnd send Nab back again to wash his face. âSub. I will: and shave himself. [Exit. âFace. If you can get him. âDol. You are hot upon it, Face, whate'er it is! âFace. A trick, that Dol shall spend ten pounds a month by. âIs he gone? âEnter Subtle. âSub. The chaplain waits you i' the hall, Sir. âFace. I'll go bestow him. [Exit. âDol. He'll now marry her instantly. âSub. He cannot yet, he is not ready. Dear Dol, âCozen her all thou canst. To deceive him âIs no deceit, but justice that would break âSuch an inextricable tie as ours was. âDol. Let me alone to fit him. âEnter Face. Face. Come, my venturers, You ha' packed up all?

'Tis true, you shall not open them, indeed; Nor have them forth. Do you see? Not forth, Dol. Dol. No! Face. No, my smock-rampant. The right is, my master Knows all, has pardon'd me, and he will keep them; Doctor, 'tis true (you look) for all your figures: I sent for him indeed. Wherefore, good partners, Both he, and she, be satisfy'd: for here Determines the indenture tripartite, 'Twixt Subtle, Dol, and Face. All I can do, Is to help you over the wall, o' the backside; Or lend you a sheet to save your velvet gown, Dol. Here will be officers presently; bethink you Of some course suddenly to 'scape the dock; For thither you'll come else. Hark you, thunder. [Some knock. Sub. You are a precious fiend! âOff. Open the door.â Face. Dol, I am sorry for thee i'faith. But hear'st thou? It shall go hard, but I will place thee somewhere: Thou shalt ha' my letter to mistress Amo. Dol. Hang youâ Face.

Subtle, Let's know where you set up next: I'll send you A customer, now and then, for old acquaintance: What new course ha' you? Sub.

Enter Officers, Mammon, Surly, Face, Kastril, Ananias, and Tribulation. Love. What do you mean, my masters! Mam. Open your door, Cheaters, bawds, conjurers. Off. Or we'll break it open. Love. What warrant have you? Off. Warrant enough, Sir, doubt not. Love. Is there an officer there? Off. Yes, two or three for failing. Love. Have but patience, And I will open it straight. Face. Sir, h' you done? Is it a marriage? perfect? Love. Yes, my brain. Face. Off with your ruff, and cloak then; be your self, Sir. Sur. Down with the door. Kas. 'Slight, ding it open. Love. Hold, Hold, gentleman, what means this violence? Mam. Where is this collier? Sur. And my Captain Face? Mam. These day-owls? Sur. That are birding in men's purses. Mam. Madam Suppository? Kas. Doxey, my suster? Ana. Locusts of the foul pit. Tri. Prophane as Bell and the Dragon. Ana. Worse than the grashoppers, or the lice of Egypt. Love. Good gentlemen, hear me. Are you officers, And cannot stay this violence? Off. Keep the peace. Love. Gentlemen, what is the matter? Whom do you seek? Mam. The chymical cozener. Sur. And the Captain Pander. Kas. The nun my suster. Mam. Madam Rabbi. Ana. Scorpions and caterpillars. Love. Fewer at once, I pray you. Off. One after another, gentlemen, I charge you, By virtue of my staff. Ana. They are the vessels Of pride, lust, and the cart. Love. Good zeal, lie still A little while. Tri. Peace, deacon Ananias. Love. The house is mine here, and the doors are open: If there be any such persons you seek for, Use your authority; I am but newly come to town, and finding This tumult 'bout my door (to tell you true) It somewhat 'maz'd me; till my man, here, (fearing My more displeasure) told me he had done Somewhat an insolent part, let out my house To a doctor, and a captain; who, what they are, Or where they be, he knows not. Mam. Are they gone? [They enter. Love. You may go in and search, Sir. Here, I find The empty walls worse than I left them, smok'd, A few crack'd pots, and glasses, and a furnace; The cieling fill'd with poesies of the candle: Only one gentlewoman, I met here, That is within, that said she was a widowâ Kas. Ay, that's my suster. I'll go thump her. Where is she? [Exit. Love. And should ha' married a Spanish count, but he, When he came to't, neglected her so grosly, That I, a widower, am gone through with her. Sur. How! Have I lost her then? Love. Were you the Don, Sir? Good faith, now, she does blame yo' extremely, and says You swore, and told her, you had ta'en the pains âTo die your beard, and umbre o'er your face,â Borrowed a suit and ruff all for her love, And then did nothing. What an oversight, And want of putting forward, Sir, was this! Well fare an old marksman, yet, Could prime his powder, and give fire, and hit, All in a twinkling. Enter Mammon. Mam. The whole nest are fled! Love. What sort of birds were they? Mam. A kind of choughs, Or thievish daws, Sir, that have pick'd my purse Of eight-score and ten pounds, within these five weeks, Beside my first materials; and my goods, That lie i' the cellar; which I am glad they ha' left. I may have them home yet. Love. Think you so, Sir? Mam. Ay. Love. By order of law, Sir, but not otherwise. Mam. Not mine own stuff? Love. Sir, I can take no knowledge, That they are yours but by public means. If you can bring certificate, that you were gull'd of them, Or any formal writ out of a court, That you did cozen yourself, I will not hold them. Mam. I'll rather lose them. Love. That you shall not, Sir, By me, in troth. Upon these terms they are yours. What should they ha' been, Sir, turn'd into gold all? Mam. No. I cannot tell. It may be they should. What then? Love. What a great loss in hope have you sustain'd? Mam. Not I, the commonwealth has. I will go mount a turnip-cart, and preach The end o' the world, within these two months. Surly, what! In a dream? Sur. Must I needs cheat myself, With that same foolish vice of honesty! Come, let us go, and hearken out the rogues. That Face I'll mark for mine, if e'er I meet him. [Exeunt. Enter Ananias and Tribulation. Trib. 'Tis well, the saints shall not lose all yet. Go, And get some cartsâ Love. For what, my zealous friends? Ana. To bear away the portion of the righteous Out of this den of thieves. Love. What is that portion? Ana. The goods, sometime the orphans, that the brethren Bought with their silver pence. Love. What, those i'the cellar, The knight Sir Mammon claims! Ana. I do defy The wicked Mammon, so do all the brethren. Thou prophane man, I ask thee with what conscience Thou canst advance that idol against us, That have the seal? Were not the shillings number'd, That made the pounds? Were not the pounds told out, Upon the second day of the fourth week, In the eighth month upon the table dormant, The year of the last patience of the saints, Six hundred and ten? Love. Mine earnest vehement botcher, And deacon also, I cannot dispute with you; But if you get you not away the sooner, I shall confute you with a cudgel. Ana. Sir? Trib. Be patient, Ananias. Ana. I am strong, And will stand up, well girt, against an host, That threaten Gad in exile. Love. I shall send you To Amsterdam to your cellar. Ana. I will pray there, Against the house: may dogs defile the walls, And wasps and hornets breed beneath thy roof, This seat of falshood, and this cave of coz'nage. [Exeunt Trib. and Ana. Face. If you get off the angry child, now, Sirâ Enter Kastril. Kas. Come on, you ewe, you have match'd most sweetly, ha' you not? [To his sister. Did I not say, I would never ha' your tup'd But by a dubb'd boy, to make you a Lady-Tom? 'Slight, you are a mammet! Oh, I could touse you, now. Death, mun'you marry with a pox? Love. You lie, boy; As sound as you; and I'm before-hand with you. Kas. Anon? Love. Come, will you quarrel? I will seize you, sirrah. Why do you not buckle to your tools! Kas. God's light! This is a fine old boy, as e'er I saw! Love. What, do you change your copy, now? Proceed. Here stands my dove? stoop at her if you dare. Kas. 'Slight, I must love him! âI cannot chuse i'faith!â And I should be hang'd for't. Suster, I protest, I honour thee for this match. Love. Oh, do you so, Sir? Kas. Yes, an'thou canst take tobacco, and drink, old boy, I'll give her five hundred pounds more to her marriage, Than her own state. Love. Fill a pipe-full, Jeremy. Face. Yes, but go in, and take it, Sir. Love. We will. I will be rul'd by thee in any thing, Jeremy. That master That had receiv'd such happiness by a servant, In such a widow, and with so much wealth, Were very ungrateful, if he would not be A little indulgent to that servant's wit, And help his fortune, though with some small strain Of his own candor. Speak for thyself, knave. Face. So I will, Sir. Gentlemen, Though I am clean Got off from Subtle, Surly, Mammon, Dol, Hot Ananias, Dapper, Drugger, all With whom I traded; yet I put myself On you that are my country; and this pelf, Which I have got, if you do quit me, rests To feast you often, and invite new guests.
