      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —A Bower of Roses, not by Bendemeer's stream. Zephyrs discovered sleeping. Enter a Zephyr to the “Gavotte de Vestris.” Zeph. How's this? what still asleep, my rosy posies? Come ope your eyes and blow your little noses. Not a leaf stirring yet—why gracious powers, Are you aware the time of day, my flowers? Have you forgotten that your Queen proposes This day to ope the Parliament of roses! Chorus—Zephyrs—“Der Freischutz”—“Bridesmaids' Chorus.” Sweet Zephyr, don't make such a breeze, We're rather late this morning, But don't be angry, if you please, We shan't be long adorning; Sleep, you know, will sometimes thus enthral us, You should earlier call us. Music—The Queen of the Roses appears. Zeph. Behold your sovereign! Silence, all and each, To hear her Majesty's most flow'ry speech. Queen. My Buds and Blossoms, I rejoice to say, That I continue to receive each day Assurances from all the foreign flowers Of their good will towards these happy bowers. I have concluded, on the best foundations, A treaty with the King of the Carnations, And trust ere long to lay the leaves before you. I'm sorry now to be obliged to bore you On an old subject, but, for your digestion At Easter, we must have an Easter question— And on my faithful Roses I depend To bring the matter to a happy end. The facts are these—a youth of royal race, Of noble mind and matchless shape and face, Has been transformed by a malicious fairy Into an ugly monster, huge and hairy And must remain a downright beast outside, 'Till some fair maid consents to be his bride. My Buds and Blossoms, you will take that measure, Of course, which best may work your sovereign's pleasure— Which is, that through a Rose's mediation The Prince may be restored to form and station. Ere nightfall, I expect you'll break the spell, And so, my Buds and Blossoms, fare ye well. Chorus —“Coal Black Rose.” Queen of Roses, we'll take care To lay before this honourable house the affair; If we can get two acts pass'd, without its being nettled, The beast will be re-formed, and the Easter question settled! No rose here that blows, Will vote against a measure, ma'am, that you propose. (Tableau and the scene closes) Scene Second. —Interior of “Pump's Folly.” Enter Marrygolda and Dressalinda. Mar. Oh, sister! sister! times have altered sadly, To think we should live poorly— Dres. And dress badly! Mar. We who have banqueted in fair Guildhall, Dres. We who have opened Easter Monday's ball— Mar. The daughters of Sir Aldgate Pump, Lord Mayor Of London once— Dres. And now, though past the chair, A knight and alderman, who might again Wear o'er the velvet gown the golden chain, Had not malicious Fortune, at one blow, Ruined the famous firm of Pump and Co. Mar. Out on the jade! could she none else have fix'd on To banish from Threadneedle Street to Brixton? Sad change from merriment to melancholy, From lordly Mansion House to poor “Pump's Folly.” Dres. It makes me mad to hear our sister Beauty Say we should be content, and prate of duty, And resignation, and that sort of stuff— She thinks a grogram gown is fine enough. Mar. And so it is for her to scrub the floor in, To cook the dinner, or to ope the door in. That's all she's fit for—with her wax doll's face, What matters what she thinks in any case! We are her elders, and her betters too, And need more ornament than she can do. Dres. Here comes papa—and in a mighty hurry! Enter Sir Aldgate Pump hastily, in great agitation, with an open letter in his hand. Sir A. Oh, Gog and Magog! Mar. Bless me, what a flurry You seem in, sir! Is anything amiss? Or have you heard good news? Sir A. Girls, come and kiss Your happy father. Pumps are up! Behold This precious letter. List, whilst I unfold The glorious tidings. Fortune, in her sport, Has brought the good ship “Polly” into port. Dres. The bark you thought was lost on some vile rock— Sir A. Is safe in Plymouth Sound. Mar. You're sure, sir. Sir A. Cock! Dres. Why she was thought the richest of your fleet. Sir A. Her cargo's worth would buy all Lombard Street. Mar. Then we again in gilded coach shall ride. Dres. And wear the richest clothes in all Cheapside. Sir A. Again a roaring trade on 'Change I'll drive! But I must hence with speed, so look alive— Where is my youngest hope, my Beauty fair? Mar. I'm sure, pa, I don't know. Dres. And I don't care! Beau. (sings without) “Gondolier, row, row.” Sir A. Hark that's her voice? as any bell 'tis clear. Mar. I'm sick of that eternal “Gondolier.” Enter Beauty, singing. Air—Beauty—“Gondolier Row”—Lover. Gondolier, row, row, Gondolier, row, row; 'Tis a pretty air, I do declare. But it haunts a body so, Gondolier, row, row, Gondolier, row, row; At work or play, By night or day, I sing it where'er I go. Beau. Good morning, sir. Sir A. Rejoice, my child, for know, The “Polly's” safe in port. Beau. You don't say so? Sir A. Read! you can read? Beau. Both print and written hand. Sir A. Accomplished creature! And can understand What you do read? Beau. Affirm that quite I wouldn't, Because, at times, e'en those who write it couldn't. Sir A. Where's my ex-clerk and faithful drudge, John Quill? Enter John Quill. John. Here, master. I am your remainder still. Sir A. Run to the “Goat in Boots.” John. Yes, master—Dot And carry one— (going) Sir A. Stop! you've not heard for what. Order a chaise and four—and mind, John, you Must travel with me— John. Dot and carry two. (Exit John) Sir A. Rot your arithmetic, and stir your stumps— This is a glorious day, girl, for the Pumps! Beau. Where go you, father? Sir A. To the ship, my dear. To land her cargo, and the Customs clear. Dres. You'll bring some present home, I hope, for me. Sir A. With all my heart, my love—what shall it be? Dres. Oh, any trifle that falls in your way— A hundred guinea shawl suppose we say. Sir A. A hundred—humph—but then your sisters too. Mar. Oh, sir, I wouldn't think of asking you To buy a shawl for me—that were too rash— I'll take a hundred guineas, sir, in cash. Sir A. Considerate child! But first, love, I must net 'em; In the meanwhile, I'll wish that you may get 'em. But what says Beauty? Is my pet so happy That she's no boon to ask of her own pappy? You've heard the choice of your two sisters here, One's for mere cash, the other for Cashmere. What says my duck? Beau. (aside) If nothing, I suppose They'll call me proud. (aloud) Well, bring me, sir, a rose. Sir A. A rose! Beau. Yes—in our little garden here There is not one at this time of the year. And I'm so fond of roses. Dres., Mar. Well, if ever! Sir A. Only a flower! Nonsense, child; endeavour To think of something else. Beau. No, sir; 'twill be Enough to prove that you have thought of me When far away. Dres., Mar. (sneeringly) Sweet sentimental soul! Sir A. I'll bring one though I search from pole to pole To find it. Re-enter John Quill. John. Sir, they've brought over the shay. Sir A. Brought over! brought it to the door you'd say. John. Yes, sir. Sir A. Are all my things well packed behind? John. I've added up, sir, all that I can find, And here is the grand total. (shewing a small parcel) Sir A. A small stock, it Won't take much room up—put it in your pocket. And now, farewell, my darlings! Behave pretty, I'll come back and astonish all the city! Quintette—“The Fox jumped over”—“Guy Mannering,” Bishop. John. I've just looked over the garden gate, And sorry am to observe it snows! Sir A. O-ho! does it so, John? I'll wrap up my pate; One last embrace, and away we goes. Beau. Wrap, father, wrap this round your chest; The day's caught cold, I do protest. For, ah! you hear,—it blows, it snows. Sir A. One last embrace, and away we goes. Dres. Beaux will swarm— John. Multiplication— Mar. Cash be plenty— John. Sweet addition— Sir A. Now, without more conversation, Here at once we part— John. Division. Exeunt Sir Aldgate, John Quill, Dressalinda, and Marrygolda. Beau. More snow! He'll have sharp weather, there's no doubt; But pa was always fond of “cold without.” Song—Air—“Susannah don't you cry”—Nigger Melody. I had a dream the other night, When everything was still, I dreamt I saw my father, Half seas over with John Quill. The cold within was nearly out, A drop was in his eye; He says to bolt I am about, So, Beauty, don't you cry. Oh, my Beauty, don't you cry for me, I'm going to California to dig gold upon my knee. And when I to the diggings get, I'll dig up all the ground, Until I find a lump of gold, That weighs ten thousand pound. Then in the good ship Polly Home I'll bring it presently, Then we'll all again be jolly, So, Beauty, don't you cry for me. Oh, my Beauty, &amp;c. (Exit Beauty) Scene Third. —A Forest—Snow storm—Crash without. Sir A. (without) Holloa! confusion! help! holloa! John Quill! John Quill enters with Sir Aldgate. John. Here, master! Sir A. Mercy on us, what a spill! The leaders shied at that confounded drover. John. Fours in a ditch, go once, sir, and two over. Sir A. “Go once,” indeed—a very pretty go— And fancy too, a heavy fall in snow! As the Scotch gentleman says in the play, “What wood is this before us?” John. I can't say. Sir A. It isn't Birnam, that's as clear as light. John. Why, no, it's more like Freez'em, to my sight. Sir A. John, we are in a pretty situation! John. I'm out completely in my calculation. Sir A. Fate seems determined, John, to use me queerly, The chaise is broken all to shivers nearly. John. I shouldn't mind the shivering of the shay, If we could keep from shivering here all day. Sir A. Is there no friendly power to shield or spare A knight and alderman who's been Lord Mayor. Protecting Genius, to my rescue fly. John. Law! you've no more a genius, sir, than I. Sir A. The deuce I haven't! See, my prayer is heard By some kind spirit—never mind the word. Scene gradually changes, the snow melting from the trees, and the forest opening and shewing a beautiful garden with a magnificent castle in the background. The sky is clearing, it has left off snowing— The wood is “all a growing, all a blowing;” And yonder I behold a castle fair, Such as I've built too often in the air. John. Oh, Bonnycastle! Sir, I ask your pardon, Your genius has cast up a lovely garden, With beds of roses, and with bowers of myrtle, Where the fond turtle— Sir A. Oh, don't mention turtle! I'm famished, and would give I know not what, For a good quart from Birch's, smoking hot. (a table rises, with a basin of soup on it) Amazement! at my wish a basin see! John. Oh, master, wish again a pint for me! (a smaller basin appears on the table) Sir A. 'Tis there! John. Now was't because I wished, or you? Perhaps I've got a little genius, too; I'll try—a nice French roll, sir, if you please; (a basket with bread rises) Now that I call getting one's bread with ease, And that's what geniuses don't often do. Sir A. This is the best bred one I ever knew. Delicious soup! John. I say, good master mine, Suppose we both wish for a little wine. Sir A. With all my heart. John. What shall it be? Champagne? Sir A. Stop! punch with turtle—punch à la Romaine. (the punch rises, they drink) Perfect! John. I should say quite. Some more to eat? Sir A. A slice of venison now, would be a treat. (the soup is replaced by a silver dish, with a lamp under it, and filled with hashed venison) A better hash ne'er smoked upon a table. John. If this were told they'd count it a mere fable. Sir A. Now if you'd fancy some superior sherry? John. Bless you, I do. (a decanter replaces the punch; Sir Aldgate drinks) Is it superior? Sir A. (setting down his glass) Very! (rises) John, I feel all the better for my lunch. John. My head is none the better for that punch. Sir A. Come, let us try if we can find our way. John. Dy'e think, sir, there is anything to pay? Sir A. I don't know, but I won't wish for the bill. John. No, don't; the gentleman might take it ill. Which is the way out? I can't tell, can you? My eyes are multiplying all by two. Sir A. I say, John, Beauty asked me for a rose; I'll take her one of these. John. Yes, do. Sir A. Here goes. Duet—Sir Aldgate and John—“I know a bank”—Bishop. I see a bank whereon a fine one blows; It can't be wrong to pluck it, I suppose; When 'tis by Beauty seen, if we get home to-night, So fond of flowers, she'll dance, sir, with delight. (Sir Aldgate gathers a rose; thunder, lightning, &amp;c.) Enter the Beast with an enormous club. Air and Chorus—“Garde à vous”—“La Fiancée,” Auber. Beast. Tremble you! tremble you! Who dare to pluck my roses, I tear ye limb from limb, and with your bones the churchyard strew. Tremble you! tremble you! tremble you! On turtle soup and punch, rogues, You've made a hearty lunch, rogues, Now I will lunch on you, lunch on you, lunch on you. Chorus . (behind the scenes) On turtle soup, &amp;c. Beast. Is this your gratitude for lunching gratis? Trespass on my preserves! Ohe jam satis! But I will have your bones ground into dust, And make a pie of you with your own crust. Sir A. Mercy, great king of clubs! one moment pause. Beast. Well, take a rule, then, rascals, to shew cause, Why I should not beat with this oaken plant, The brains of both out— John. Brains from one you can't. Sir A. Pity the sorrows of a poor old Pump, Whose trembling knees against each other thump, And listen, with a kind attentive ear, While he explains what now seems rather queer. Air—Sir Aldgate—“Under the Rose”—“Love in a Village.” Great sir, don't fly out, for a trifle like this, What harm have I done, sir? one rose you can't miss. Don't make, if you please, sir, so fierce a grimace, You'd have done the same thing, had you been in my place. I'm a family man, sir; fair daughters I've three. There's one they call Beauty, because she's like me; Her pleading resistless what heart could oppose,— “Papa,” said the pretty girl, “bring me a rose.” Beast. I don't believe a word of this affair. Sir A. As I'm an alderman, and have been Mayor, You may depend on the account I give. John. As I'm a liveryman, who hopes to live, If you examine his account, you'll find it Correct. Beast. Your promise, then, and oath to bind it, That you will bring that daughter here to die Instead of you— Sir A. To die! Oh, my! John. Oh, cry! Beast. Come, make your mind up quickly, you or she? Decide! It's immaterial quite to me. Sir A. My lord!— Beast. I'm not a lord, sir; I'm a beast. Sir A. You wouldn't have us call you one, at least? Beast. I would—I like the truth—I'm a plain creature. John. The plainest that I ever saw, in feature. Beast. Is it a bargain? Speak, I wait to strike it. Sir A. I'll go and ask my daughter if she'd like it. Beast. Of course, man, that's exactly what I meant; I wouldn't eat her without her consent. Sir A. If I object, then, sir, you won't eat me? Beast. Oh! that's another matter quite, you see! Come, swear you will return in either case. Sir A. I do! Beast. By what? Sir A. The city sword and mace! Beast. 'Tis well; away! I shall expect you back In half-an-hour— Sir A. In half-an-hour! Good lack! How far are we from home? Beast. Four leagues and more, But here's an omnibus goes past your door, And only stops to take up and set down. A car on which is written “Time flies, No stoppages,” with a Zephyr for a driver, and another for a Cad, appears at the back of the stage. Cad. Now, sir, Bank? city! Bank! going up to town? Sir A. (getting in, followed by John) Pump's Folly, Brixton. Beast. With the speed of light! (to Cad) In half an hour? (to Sir Aldgate) Sir A. Certainly! Cad. All right! (they fly off—Exit Beast) Scene Fourth. —Interior of Cottage (as before). Enter Dressalinda, Marrygolda, and Beauty. Air—Marrygolda—“'Tis really very strange.” 'Tis really very strange. But people say, on 'Change, That some ill-natured folks Have dared papa to hoax, And that in Plymouth Sound No “Polly's” to be found. 'Tis really very strange, But that's the news on 'Change. They also say, on 'Change, What's even still more strange, That Beauty's above par; And we at discount are! Now if this should be true, Oh dear, what shall we do? 'Tis really very strange, But that's the news on 'Change. Dres. Hark! there's the gate bell! why, who can it be? Mar. Beauty! how now? why don't you run and see? Beau. I'm going, sister. (Exit) Dres. Going!—stir, then, stir! She really wants a maid to wait on her. Mar. What has she done to-day? Dres. Her work—no more. Mar. The lazy hussy! Re-enter Beauty. Dres. Well, who's at the door? Beau. My father! in his habit as he started. Mar. Can it be possible? Dres. The dear departed! Enter Sir Aldgate and John Quill. Mar. Returned so soon! John. Returned, like a bad penny. Dres. You've got my shawl? Sir A. No, for I've not seen any. Mar. The money, sir, for me, at least, you've brought. Sir A. I've seen no money— John. Dot and carry nought. Dres. No shawl! Mar. No money! what a horrid bore. Sir A. I've brought a rose for beauty—nothing more. Beau. Oh, thanks! I hope it has not cost you dear? Sir A. Only my life, my love. Beau. What's this I hear? Sir A. “Forlorn, deserted, melancholy, slow,” (For we'd been overturned, love, in the snow) We wandered, like two large babes in the wood, Except that no cock robins brought us food, When, lo, a splendid mansion rose to sight, Which, talk of Robins, George alone could write George Robins, of Covent Garden, auctioneer, was notorious for his grandiloquent descriptions of the property he was entrusted to sell, or, as he phrased it, “submit to public competition.” A true description of—Meand'ring streams, Perennial bowers that mocked the poets' dreams; Surpassing all that ere that great magician “Submitted” yet “to public competition!” Nor was the eye alone allowed to feed, Turtle and punch were furnished us with speed. Nothing to pay—Turtle without a bill, And Punch that made a Judy of John Quill. John, tell the rest, for out I cannot bring it. John. I haven't heart to say it, sir. Beau. Then sing it. John. I'll try—perhaps the air may do you good. Beau. I shouldn't wonder really if it would. Air—John Quill—“I have plucked the fairest flower.” He thought of Beauty's flower, And he popp'd into a bower, And he pluck'd the fairest rose That he found beneath his nose; But scarce had he done so, When a monster, black as crow, Like an arrow from a bow, Flew out and cried, “Holloa! Here's a very pretty go, a very pretty go, You rascals, Oh! You have spoiled my flower-show, And to pot you both shall go In a squab pie, oh!” Then we fell upon our knees, And we said, “Sir, if you please, We did not mean to offend, 'Twas to please a lady friend.” On which he answered “Oh! If indeed the truth be so, You'll be good enough to go, And just let that lady know She must pay for Pump and Co., Pay for Pump and Co.” 'Twas a horrid blow, And it made us very low, And we've come to let you know, With a sad heigho! Beau. The horrid brute! Mar. How could you be so silly? Dres. What was he like? John. The Black Bear, Piccadilly. Now pulled down. It stood near the Albany. Sir A. (to Beauty) To cut my story short, or you, or I Must for the brute be made into squab pie. Beau. Oh horror! make a squab pie of my father! I'd rather—oh, I don't know what I'd rather. Mar. I hope, Miss Beauty, you are satisfied. Dres. Your rose has proved a nice thorn in your side. Mar. Our father's death will lie, miss, at your door. Beau. Never! I'll die a hundred deaths before. Sir A. My noble child! John. The very Queen of Trumps! Sir A. Oh fate! come to the succour of the Pumps! Let not the flower of our ancient race Be made into a pie before my face. John. “Time flies!”—you told the omnibus to call As it went back. Dres. This time do get my shawl. Mar. And if you can but bring me fifty pounds, Or only five-and-twenty, sir— Sir A. Odd zounds! Is this a time about such trash to tease, When your poor sister— Enter Cad. Cad. Now, sir, if you please. Beau. Farewell, dear sisters, I forgive you both. Go, father. Sir A. And fare worse—oh, cruel oath! John. Don't cast up hope, dear master, fate may save her And strike a balance yet, sir, in our favour. Quintette—“Mild as the Moonbeams”—“Artaxerxes.” [Dressalinda, Marrygolda, Beauty, Sir Aldgate, John Quill] To death, per omnibus, poor Beauty goes, And all because her pa just plucked a rose. Mild as the moon, when a cream-cheese she resembles, And sweet as sugar-plums, Birch's best. Scene Fifth. —Saloon in the Palace of the Beast—A banquet set out. Enter Beast. Beast. Gallop apace, ye fiery-footed steeds. Oh, if this little scheme of mine succeeds, The smile of Beauty will the spell destroy, And I shall jump out of my skin with joy! Air—“My love is like a red, red rose.” I sent my love a red, red rose, And hoped she would come soon. She can't be long now, I suppose, For, by my watch, 'tis noon. Oh, haste and try, my bonny lass, In love with me to fall, And you may find 'twill come to pass, I'm not a beast at all, my dear, I'm not a beast at all. I know I look a fright, my dear, But yet my hopes are high; There's many a girl has loved, my dear, A greater brute than I. Say but you'll wed me, sweet Miss Pump, And to my own fair isle, Out of my skin, for joy I'll jump, At least ten thousand mile, my dear, At least ten thousand mile. She comes! be still, my heart—yes, she is there, And something like a beauty, I declare. Let me retire, nor shock, at first, her sight; But minister, unseen, to her delight. (retires) Enter Sir Aldgate, Beauty, and John Quill. Sir A. Well, here we are. Beau. It is a lovely place To live in. John. Yes, but that's another case— You've come to die. Beau. That makes it rather duller. Sir A. A horse, my dear, of quite another colour. John. There's dinner ready; take a mouthful, will you? Sir A. They'd fatten you, it seems, before they kill you. Beau. The thought quite takes my appetite away. John. Master, you'll pick a morsel? do, sir, pray. Sir A. I couldn't touch a bit, 'twould make me ill; There isn't any turtle, is there, Quill? John. Plenty, both calipash and calipee. Sir A. Indeed! Well, if I must, I must. Beau. Ah me! I'm getting nervous. (noise within) Ugh! what's that? John. The Beast— The—the—that is—the founder of the feast. Enter Beast. Beast. Madam, you're welcome; won't you take a seat? Beau. I come, sir, to be eaten, not to eat. Beast. And come you, madam, of your own accord? Answer me truly. Beau. Yes, indeed, my lord. Beast. Don't call me lord, I beg. I told your father My title is “The Beast.” Beau. Well, if you'd rather— Beast. But now to business. I'm o'erjoyed to know You came here willingly. Pump, you may go! Concerted Piece—“Begone, dull Care.” Beast. Begone, old Pump, I prithee begone from me; Begone, old Pump, Thy face let me no more see; Thy daughter who is tarrying here, Instead of thee I'll kill; So begone, old Pump, And take with thee young John Quill. Sir A. When Lord Mayor, Had anyone dared to say Half that, there Would have been the deuce to pay; But, alas, they snap their fingers now At Sir Aldgate Pump and say, Ex-Lord Mayor, Like a dog, you've had your day. (Exeunt Sir Aldgate and John Quill) Beast. Now, madam, we're alone, dismiss your fear, I trust to make you very happy here; Although I feel that I could eat you up, I'd rather with you breakfast, dine, and sup, If you'll permit me, but I won't intrude; You'll find, I hope, my outside only rude; I beg you'll make yourself at home completely. Beau. I never thought a beast could speak so sweetly! Beast. You find me very hideous, I'm afraid. Beau. Why, I— Beast. Oh, speak out, call a spade a spade! I like to hear the truth, whate'er it be. Beau. Indeed! Oh there, then, we shall both agree! Beast. Did you e'er see aught like me? Beau. Yes, the what-d'ye-call They once had at the Surrey Zoological. Beast. The what-d'ye-call! and was that like me? Beau. Very. A great baboon—they called him “Happy Jerry!” Beast. Were I your “Jerry,” I should “happy” be. Oh! could I fancy you could fancy me. Beau. My Jerry! nay, in that light, truth to speak, There's more of “Bruin” in your looks than “Sneak.” Beast. This candour's quite enchanting! Matchless fair, “Your eyes are loadstars, and your tongue's sweet air, More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear;” Allow me to take wine with you. Beau. Oh dear! Air—Beast—“Drink to me only.” Drink to me only with your eyes, If you object to wine; But if you'll taste this claret cup, I think you'll own 'tis fine. But drink to me only with your eyes, If you object to wine. Beast. 'Tis late, and you need rest—I will retire; Pray call for anything you may desire! Behold your room. (over the door of a room appear, in letters of gold, the words, “Beauty's Apartment”) You'll find a wardrobe there, With every sort of dress you'd like to wear. Costumes from every land, North, South, West, East. Beau. Delightful! Beast. Good-night, Beauty! Beau. Good-night, Beast! (Exit Beast) Well, I declare! a very civil brute! If manners make the man, beyond dispute He must be one, though he don't look the part. He seems a perfect gentleman at heart, And one that, cruelly, no girl would e'er cut; If he'd just shave his beard, and have his hair cut; Come, downy sleep, a balm from thee I'll borrow, And look at all these fine affairs to-morrow. Beauty flings herself on the couch and falls asleep; the Hall is immediately filled with Spirits of the Rose and Zephyrs, the Queen of the Roses in the midst. Queen. Beauty, you've been a good girl, and I'll see That you're rewarded as you ought to be; Dance round her couch, ye flowers and spirits bright, And give her pleasant dreams and slumbers light.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —Beauty's Boudoir in the Palace of the Beast. Enter Beauty, richly attired, with a rose in her hand. Air—Beauty—“Jim along Josey.” Oh, Rose, as in yon garden you happened to grow, P'rhaps, my pretty Rosey, its master you know? He looks like a brute, but he acts like a king, And—bless me! I scarcely know what 'tis I sing. Oh, get along, get along, Rosey; Oh, get along, get along, do. Poor old papa he kindly let go, And he hasn't ate me yet—as far as I know; And if he should really offer, instead, To marry me—pshaw! what put that in my head? Go, get along, get along, Rosey; Go, get along, get along, do. Enter Beast. Beast. Good morning, fairest Beauty; how d'ye do? Beau. I'm pretty well, I thank you; how are you? Beast. Dying for love; I couldn't sleep all night For thinking of you. Beau. Oh! you're too polite. I've had a nice nap, and such pleasant dreams; I've got a fairy friend at court, it seems; With loves and graces, all in flowers and wings, She came last night, and said such pretty things. Beast. You feel quite happy then? Beau. Oh, no, not quite! Beast. Say, what can make you so? Beau. Dear Beast, a sight Of my poor father; I'm afraid he's ill. Will you oblige me? Beast. Certainly I will; Look in that glass, my charming fair—“Veluti In Speculum!”—Behold him there, my Beauty. Music—The glass expands, and shews the inside of the cottage, with Sir Aldgate Pump, John Quill, Dressalinda, and Marrygolda, in a tableau vivant. Beau. Oh, dear! he's looking very sad and poorly; Could you just let me hear his voice, sir? Beast. Surely. (music—waves his hand) Sir Aldgate Pump sings without. Oh! where, and oh! where, is my darling Beauty gone? She's gone to fight the French, for King George upon his throne! And it's oh! in my heart, I wish she was safe at home. (tableau closes) Beau. His mind seems wand'ring! Beast. What he calls his mind. Beau. Well, if not very wise, he's very kind, And loves me dearly. Let me go, I pray, And comfort him— Beast. How? Beau. Just to spend the day; I will return ere Sol sinks in the deep. Beast. I dare say. Catch a weasel fast asleep. Beau. You doubt my word! I thought you more gallant. Beast. Ask for aught else; but that I cannot grant. Beau. Then you don't love me, as you say you do. Beast. Not love you! Oh, my wig and whiskers! who Ere loved so well as I— Beau. There's no believing You brutes of men,—you're always so deceiving. Beast. (aside) I am a beast indeed, to make her cry; Who pipes so sweet should never pipe her eye. Beau. My pa will die, and you will be the cause; My fate is in your hands. Beast. Ah! (he looks at her and remains silent) Beau. (looking at his hands) Awful pause! Beast. You won't come back again—I know you won't. Beau. I wish I may be shot, then, if I don't. Beast. You'll be the death of me, mind, if you stay One moment after sunset— Beau. Trust me, pray! Beast. Upon your mercy, then, myself I fling, And so, to prove my love, behold this ring! Don't start—it's not a wedding one— Beau. I vow You make me feel—I—really—don't know how. Beast. The moment that this ring your finger's fixed on, Hey, presto, pass, you'll find yourself at Brixton! And vice versa—pull it off—you'll be As quick as thought—at home, love, to a tea. Beau. Oh, give it me—I long its power to try. Beast. One chaste embrace before you say good-bye! Duet—“Tancredi.” Beau. Embrace you? oh dear no! Beast. Ah, say, aren't you content to pare, here, my heart, pray, to the core? Remember, I do this to please you, all else is naught to me now. Beau. Well, to appease you, though 'tis strange, I'll not say no. (he embraces her) Beast. Oh! say you'll marry me, I Can't bear it any more; Say “yes,” and all men shall see I Can, for you, the world throw o'er. Beau. I'll tell you some other day, When I come back, not before; Don't press me now, dear sir, I pray, I tremble, oh! dear me, all o'er. No, no, not now, I tremble, oh dear me, all o'er, Let me go now, sir—to Brixton, to Brixton. Beast. To Brixton, to Brixton. Both. The ring but once fixed on You find yourself there / I find myself there. Beast. Go, then, away, now, to see thy father. Both. Spite o'the distance you'll/I'll soon trip it o'er, The ring will lead her/me to Brixton speed her/me And in a jiffy she'll/I'll be at the door. (Beauty puts on the ring—Exit Beast) Sudden change to The Cottage (as before). Beau. This beats the railroad out and out, I vow. This is a way to ring the changes now. Here come my sisters—how surprised they'll be. Enter Dressalinda, Marrygolda, and John Quill. All. (scream) Oh! Dres. Mercy on us! Mar. What is this we see? Beau. Dear sisters, don't you know me? All. Oh! a ghost! Beau. No, no! No spirit from the Stygian coast— I am your real flesh and blood relation— So pray subdue this needless consternation! Dres., Mar. Beauty alive! John. Fate up again has cast her, And made all right. Here, master! master! master! (runs out) Mar. I'm all amazement! how did this befall? Hasn't the Beast, then, ate you after all? Dres. Has he consented back his prey to render? Were you too tough? or has he been too tender? Beau. Where is my father? let me calm his fears, And then I'll tell you all about it, dears. Mar. He was half crazy—now he'll be quite wild. Enter Sir Aldgate and John Quill. Sir A. Where is my poppet—where's my precious child? John. There she is, “all alive, oh!” like the eels! Sir A. Oh, who can tell what a fond father feels, When— Dres. La, papa, pray don't be so pathetic, To me such stuff is worse than an emetic. Sir A. Well, anything, child, for a quiet life. Mar. Come, tell us all—are you the monster's wife? Or is he dead, and left you his sole heiress? Dres. You're drest as fine as any Lady Mayoress! Beau. I am not married—and he isn't dead. Sir A. But from the monster have you naught to dread? Beau. If he kills me, 'twill be with kindness merely— He's all attention—vows he loves me dearly— Would marry me to-morrow, if I chose, And gives me everything you can suppose. Mar. He's rich? Beau. As Crœsus. Sir A. Crœsus? Oh! I know, He was Lord Mayor of Greece, some time ago. Dres. And wears fine robes? Beau. A bear skin— Dres., Mar. How improper! John. A, B, E, A, R—Bear-skin—a rough wrapper— A sort of pilot-coat. Beau. Just so—but here I've brought you what you wished for, sisters dear; There is your shawl, and there your hundred guineas. Both. Oh, thank you! Dres. (aside) Sister, we've been two great ninnies! If you or I had volunteered to go, We should have had all this good luck, you know. Mar. (aside) To mar her triumph let us yet endeavour, I hate the odious creature worse than ever. Sir A. The fellow lives in fine style, I must say— Turtle for dinner, no doubt, every day. Gad, if I thought he'd hold his horrid jaw, I shouldn't much mind being papa-in-law— That's if you'd have him, child, not else, I vow. Beau. But as your ship's come home, you're wealthy now. Sir A. Oh, no! 'twas all a hoax about the “Polly,” No matter, you're alive, so let's be jolly! You are my treasure, as my Lady Crackeye Said once— Beau. You mean the mother of the Gracchi. Sir A. Crackeye or Grackeye, it's all one. Let's see What we've for dinner— Beau. I go back to tea, Remember that! Sir A. Go back? John. Not come to stay? Beau. Oh, no, I only came to spend the day: I must return ere sunset, or the Beast Will ne'er forgive me. Dres. (aside to Marrygolda) There's one chance, at least. We'll try and make her overstay the hour. And then the Beast will surely her devour! Sir A. Come all, then, let's be merry while we can. John. If you're for fun, you know, sir, I'm your man. Glee—“Come stain your cheeks.” Come o'er a glass of good brown sherry, Let's while we can be very merry. Ladies. Pray don't get tipsy. Sir A., John. Only merry. (Exeunt Sir Aldgate, John Quill, and Beauty) Dres. Press her to take some negus—then you brew it, And pop a little poppy juice into it. Mar. I take your hint—I'll dose her, never doubt it. (Exit Marrygolda) Dres. What fun! She'll make a precious fuss about it. Air—“On the Banks of Allan Water.” By a glass of wine and water, Made quite soporifical, Soon our father's fine pet daughter, Fast asleep shall fall; And the Beast, who had besought her, To return in time for tea, When re-appearing, thus has caught her, Breakfast will on she. Re-enter Marrygolda. Mar. I've done the deed, and hither comes the gipsy. Dres. Where's father? Mar. He and John have got quite tipsy. Dres. The sun is setting now—as red brick. Mar. Don't let her see it! Draw the curtains, quick! Re-enter Beauty. Beau. Sister, I feel so sleepy, you can't think. Mar. (aside) It works! it works! (Exit Marrygolda) Dres. (aside) “The drink, Hamlet, the drink!” Beau. How goes the time? Dres. Oh, it's quite early yet; We'll tell you when the sun's about to set, So if you'd like to take a nap— Beau. Methinks I'd give the world for only forty winks. Dres. Then why not take them in that easy chair? Beau. If I was sure you'd wake me— Dres. We'll take care. Beau. No, no, I'll drive this drowsiness away. Dres. At any rate, sit down, dear, while you stay. Beau. I'm sure 'tis time—I must be going—going— (falls asleep) Dres. You're gone, my dear, and see, the west is glowing With the last rays of sunset—sleep, sleep sound; I'd not disturb you for a hundred pound! (Exit Dressalinda) The scene opens at the back and the Beast appears. Air—Beast—“All is lost now”—“Sonnambula,” Bellini. All is lost now—Oh, for me the sun is set for ever— This poor heart in future never One hope of bliss can see. Go, ungrateful. Counted on your word I had, miss, Your behaviour's very bad, miss, It has made me nearly mad, miss, Quite unhappy, as you may see. With all confidence appealing, To any man of feeling, I'd ask, is this fair dealing? No! you've used me, madam, really very ill. Though my looks might fail to charm you, Though they rather might alarm you, Yet I promis'd not to harm you; Yes, false one, yes; and I'll keep my promise still. The scene closes; Beauty seems exceedingly disturbed in her sleep; enter John and Sir Aldgate, both tipsy, John carrying a candle. Sir A. John, take care how you go; you'll drop that candle. John. Never you mind, old Pump! here, where's your handle? Sir A. John, is this language to a late Lord Mayor? Where is my Beauty? John. (holds the candle to him) You may well ask “where?” Not in your face,—it's ugly as a nigger's; Nor in your form, if I'm a judge of figures! Sir A. John! I discharge you. John. What! subtract your brains? Take me from you, and, prithee, what remains? A dry old pump! Sir A. Well, well, you'll change this tone! John. “Well.—” Pump, be quiet, and let well alone; If you don't know when you've got a good man, I know when I've got a good master! (Music, con sordini—Beauty rises in her sleep, and stands up in the chair) Sir A. (starting) Can I trust my sight—back, John, at distance keep, Here's beauty, bolt upright, and in her sleep! John. Perhaps she's dead, and that's her ghost that's walking! Sir A. Horrible thought! No! hush! I hear her talking! Beauty descends from the chair in imitation of Amina in the “Sonnambula”—the Two Sisters enter, and are stopped by a sign from Sir Aldgate Pump. Concerted Piece—“Sonnambula.” All. Bless us, and save us, where is she going now? (Beauty steps from the chair upon the table) Over the table. (she kicks a book off) Oh, criky! She'll tumble, by jingo! (Beauty steps off to another chair, and then to a stool, and then to the ground) No, no; she's all right. (Beauty approaches the front of the stage) Beau. Don't cry, Beast; I'll come back. Sir A. D'ye hear that, John? Beau. 'Tis tea time; Molly, put the kettle on. All. Hear her! how she's dreaming,—speaking of tea. Beau. Yes, I have lost him; and yet I am not guilty. All. Oh, listen! Beau. The ring he gave me, alas! he'll now take from me. He'll never let me come out to tea more. All. She wakes! Beau. Where am I? Ar'n't it very late? I've overslept myself, as sure as fate. It's dark as pitch! Oh, dear! what's to be done? There's nothing left me but to cut and run. Sir A. Dear daughter— Beau. Don't detain me, sir, good-bye To all—off goes my ring, and off go I!
