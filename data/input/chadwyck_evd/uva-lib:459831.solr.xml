      <field name="fulltext">ACT YE FIRST SCENE YE FIRST Enter FLORELLI and LODOVICO, Courtiers FLO. I am glad the Queene hath throwne off mourning, this is her first Day of state. LODO. e'en what she please. but I wish still, that her Ascent to the Throne had been more naturall. FLO. Take heed, i' th'Court Are many Eares. LODO. There's an elder Sister, is that Treason? FLO. Shee went before to th'Nunnery. LODO. A Crowne should Tempt weake Fleshe, and Blood, shee's but In her Probation yet, though shee had been Profest, there haue been Dispensationsâ but shee was not Consulted. FLO. Malvecchio, our great Minister of state was Active for Artemia. LODO. Yes, and the Duke Guarini too. FLO. I expected rather, he being a Prynce of the Blood, and a man Popular, would at this nick of tyme, putt in a Tytleâ LODO. And Leap't into the Throne himselfe; FLO. but he has taken a more easy way to that Advancement, if wee may praesage from the Queenes favours, by whose choyce of him (as the present streame inclynes her) he may Rise to a King without this Trouble of Appearing Ambitious for it. LODO. oh the Court Pollitiques! there is not so much juggling in Cards, there must be knaues in both. Enter OCTAVIO FLO. You come from the Presence, is the Queene come forth? OCT. Not yet, but Addresses are Crowding from all parts; the Embassador from Lumbardy this Day is to haue Audience: LODO. To Congratulate her; the Complement of Princes! OCT. Shee is Prepar'd for All, spreading her Graces, like the Sunn, which cheeres, And Quickens all things with its Beames. LODO. But multiplyes, I hope, her smyles, vpon the Duke her kinsman, FLO. And I Judge his Grace will make a kind Construction of 'em. Enter the DUKE and MALVECCHIO here comes the Riseing starre, if the young Queene Preserve her Influence. OCT. And my Lord Malvecchioâ wee shall be thought to Interrupt 'em; Exeunt DUKE. In your Conference with the Queene my Lord how did you find her, when you Nam'd her Sister? MAL. Shee putt it Sr a Question to my Conscience But her Ambition with some Artifice I vs'd in your Behalfe, soone lay'd the Scruple. DUKE. Your Councells haue a merritorious care of me, my Lord. MAL. I were vngratefull to my Being else. DUKE. I cannot but Acknowledge the Queene has been Bounteous in her Graces to oblige me. MAL. But shee's a woeman.â Reasons of state will Teach her Constancy, who is too wise to offer a Neglect to you, Belov'd at Home, and full of Forrayne Gloryes; which with your neere Allyance to her Crowne, might Bid you else be singly King, but that your starres Design'd for you a smoother way by Ryseing to her Bed, to which your owne Attractions Giue Assurance. DUKE. Tyme will Resolve our Expectationsâ MAL. will Fix 'em Sir. Enter OCTAVIO OCT. The Queene Desires your presence Sir. to ye Duke MAL. I lyke this, shee will not misse you in her Eye, A signe you are neere her Heart. Enter LEONIDAS and BARSANES DUKE. My Lord, wee misse you much at Court, though you haue lost a Freind of the late King, You haue no cause to Doubt the Queene his Daughter will haue a lesse Regard to a Person of your Honour, I heard her often aske for you. LEO. I am not worth her memory, or mention. DUKE. This is the first Day of her publicke appearance. LEO. It carryes a fayre omen, the Embassador of Lumbardy this Day Expects his Audience too. I shall be a glad wittnesse of her Gloryes, before I leaue the Kingdome. DUKE. I hope you will not make Naples so vnhappy, that but now Beginns to shyne. LEO. I but Remoue 1st whistle ready a trouble from the Court, and from your Grace, by my Impertinent vizitts. DUKE. If I haue Power, I hope you will Commend it Sr to serve you. LEO. Your Highnesse does me too great an Honour, MAL. Put me into the Number of your servants. Exit DUKE and MALVECCHIO LEO. Your Bountyes flow too much vpon a stranger; howeuer theise for their state ends Allow the Change, I wish the King had Liv'd; BAR. I doe not blame you, Sir for had not Death surpriz'd him, you were not Canopie Gauzd without some hope by his kind Ayd in tyme to haue beenâ LEO. Not too loude, those thoughts are Bury'd with him, 'twas by his secrett Contributions wee haue liu'd; Barsanes, 'tis now tyme to take my leaue. BAR. And thinke of some safe way for your Returne; Rumour too long hath spread your Death, who knowes But kinder starres may wayte on this Resolve; And you are so much forward on your way to know your subtle Ennemy, by whose Pollicyes you were supplanted young, is taken to another world. LEO. I may haue Roome in this, vnlesse my Fate Decree me lost. BAR. That Providence, which hath Remou'd your Stepmother, who to Advance her Eaglet, thus longe made you a stranger to your owne Country, holds out now (if I haue any Augury) a Beame to Invite you; besyde some present streightsâ LEO. Ile see what this Embassador pretends to, And then Farewell to Naples, be thou still the Conduct and Companion of my Fortune, BAR. you haue Deserv'd my Duty Sir. Exeunt SCENE THE SECOND State Scene Courtiers, and Statesmen before the QUEENE under a Canopy led by the DUKE to her seate. MALVECCHIO LEONIDAS, &amp; BARSANES, Lords, and Ladyes Attendant, when ye QUEENE is sate. MAL. It is the Joy of euery Heart to see This Throne so fairely fill'd, and from the Race of Him, whose Name and Memory is Sacred. DUKE. May the blest Angells houer still about it to keepe you safe and Glorious; may Cares and Dangers which Attend All other Crownes Loose their way hither, and if the Prayers of those whose Dutyes you Deserve may find Accesse to Heauen, there shall not be a Blessing there that shall not fall vpon your Heart, &amp; Kingdome. FLO. His Grace hath spoken All our Hearts. LEO. Madam, be pleas'd, to let a stranger lay his Grayne of Incense at this happy Altar: for though I was not Borne within your Confines, Your Favours haue created me your subject. QUEEN. Noble Leonidas. LEO. Liue Glorious in your Naples, Lov'd, and Honour'd; And may the Example of your virtues teach your Neighbour Princes, how to Rule, and Prosper: Liue in the Hearts of more then your owne people And for the good of earth, Goe late to Heaven. Liue Madam by your Actions to Improue your Fame so great, that when you Dye, Posterity may make it all theire Buisnesse to Admire you. QUEEN. you are so Just, I dare not Doubt your wishes. our cleare and hearty thanks to All, and as you haue with such a freedome of your souls Declar'd me Queene, I hope I shall not want Your faythfull and free Counsells to support me, whome you haue made and Plac'd aboue you; and I shall with the best Studyes, my weake sex Can Reach, Employ my Cares to make me worthy of All your Loves, and Loyaltyes; But my Lord to the Duke and Princely Kinsman what wee owe to your Great merrits, neuer can be payd with Language, and therefore something must be thought on higher. LEO. There it Goes. MAL. what Honours you Bestow on him must be Addition to the Generall Happynesse. DUKE. Madam, you are ouer Gracious; and Call that Merritt, which is but my Duty. QUEEN. Be it your Care, who are Nam'd of our Councell to see the Lawes Preserve their owne free Channell. LODO. I, now shee has broken 'em for her owne Ambition, they shall be kept hereafter for the Humillity of the Subject. QUEEN. It is my wounder, all this whyle wee heare nothing from our Sister Ariana, Prepare our kindest Letters, it is fitt shee know vpon what Hindge, the State moues now. LEO. You'l Doe me Sir an Honour. to ye Duke DUKE. Madam, the Lord Leonidas would make an humble Suite. QUEEN. For what? it must be a strange Request wee should Deny him. DUKE. He Prayes the Grace to kisse your Royall Hand; some Great Affayres in his owne Country presse him to Leaue the Court, and Naples. QUEEN. That must not be; My Lord, I hope you will not leaue vs now. LEO. Tis my vnhappynesse. QUEEN. Wee shall thinke it ours, if Naples haue been Guilty of vnkindnesse to your Personâ LEO. Not in the least, nor is the Cause, Royal Madam, that Calls me hence worthy of your Regard, who am too Inconsiderable to giue your Majesty a Concerne for me. QUEEN. But this will haue the face of some neglect to us, as if you did not well Resent my Fortune: LEO. Such an Impiety be farre from euery thought; I should Esteeme no Happynesse to your Commands. QUEEN. Ile try that by Enjoynment of your stay; My Father thought your Presence gaue his Court An ornament; He Lov'd you well, let vs not loose you for his sake. It must be so, And you may not Repent it. LEO. I must obey then. Enter OCTAVIO OCT. Madam, the Embassador from the King of Lumbardy QUEEN. Giue your Attendances.

In playne, now you are settled in your Throne, He wishes Lombardy the next Advance to be Receaud yours Madam, if you can find an Affection for the King my Master, whose Glorious Name, and merrits is already the pryde of Fame. DUKE. I did suspect this. LEO. Here may be a Match Barsanes. MAL. This Treaty comes too late. SEM. The losse he had in the late mother Queene whose Providence and Piety made easy for his Greene yeares, the mannage of a Kingdome; with Treasures daily filling vp his Coffers, will haue free Recompence he sayes, if Heauen Prosper the fayre Conjunction of your Hearts; And if so Great a Blessing may be hop'd for After a Councell of your thoughts, you may make vp one Empire of your Minds &amp; Countryes.

You are my Kinsman. DUKE. Call me your Servant Madam. ARI. I would Call you Just, and Honest, but I feare. FLO. That word pinches. ARI. If I mistake not Couzen, I Know this Presence, wherein my Royall Fatherâ At that word I must pause; I misse him here. MAL. He is Dead Madam, and snatchd hence to Heauen Before wee thought him sick, by a violent Apoplexy. ARI.
