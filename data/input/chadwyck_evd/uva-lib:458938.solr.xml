      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Sir Perfidious Old-craft an old Knight, and Witty-pate his Sonne. Witty. Sir, i'me no Boy, i'me deepe in one and twenty, The second yeare's approaching. Old K. A fine time For a youth to live by his wits then I should thinke, If e're he meane to make account of any. Witty. Wits Sir? Old K. I wits Sir, if it be so strange to thee, I'me sorry I spent that time to get a Foole, I might have imploy'd my paines a great deale better; Thou know'st all that I have I ha got by my wits, And yet to see how urgent thou art too; It grieves me thou art so degenerate To trouble me for meanes, I never offer'd it: My Parents from a Schoole-boy, past nineteen once, See what these times are growne too, before twenty I rusht into the world, which is indeed Much like the Art of Swimming, he that will atteine to't Must fall plumpe, and duck himselfe at first, And that will make him hardy and adventurous, And not stand putting in one foot and shiver, And then draw tother after, like a quake-buttock; Well he may make a padler i' the world, From hand to mouth, but never a brave swimmer, Borne up byth' chin as I bore up my self With my strong industry that never fayl'd me; For he that lyes borne up with Patrimonies, Lookes like a long great Asse that swims with bladders, Come but one prick of adverse fortune to him He sinkes, because he never try'd to swim When wit playes with the billowes that choackt him. Witty. Why is it not a fashion for a Father Sir, Out of his yearely thousands, to allow His only sonne a competent brace of hundreds, Or such a toy? Old K. Yes, if he meane to spoyle him, Or mar his wits he may, but never I This is my humour Sir, which you'le finde constant; I love wit so well because I liv'd by't, That ile give no man power out of my meanes to hurt it, And that's a kinde of gratitude to my rayser, Which great ones oft forget; I admire much This Ages dulnesse, when I scarce writ man, The first degree that e're I tooke in thriving, I lay intelligencer close for wenching, Could give this Lord or Knight a true Certificate Of all the Maiden-heads extant, how many lay 'Mongst Chamber-maids, how many 'mongst Exchange Wenches, Though never many there I must confesse, They have a trick to utter ware so fast; I knew which Lady had a minde to fall, Which Gentlewoman new divorc'st, which Trades-man breaking, The price of every sinner to a haire, And where to raise each price; which were the Tearmers That would give Velvet Petty-coates, Tissue Gownes, Which Peeces, Angells, Suppers, and Halfe crownes; I knew how to match and make my market, Could give intelligence where the Pox lay ledger, And then to see the Letchers shift a point, 'Twas sport and profit too; how they would shun Their ador'd Mistris chambers, and run fearefully, Like Rats from burning houses, so brought I My Clyents a the game still safe together, And noble Gamesters lov'd me, and I felt it: Give me a man that lives by his wits say I, And never left a Groat, there's the true Gallant. When I grew somewhat pursie, I grew then In mens opinions too, and confidences, They put things call'd Executorships upon me, The charge of Orphans, little sencelesse creatures, Whom in their Childe-hoods I bound forth to Feltmakers, To make 'em lose and work away their Gentry, Disguise their tender natures with hard custome, So wrought 'em out in time, there I rizze ungently, Nor do I feare to discourse this unto thee, I'me arm'd at all points against treachery, I hold my humour firme, if I can see thee thrive by Thy wits while I live, I shall have the more courage To trust thee with my Lands when I dye; if not, The next best wit I can heare of carries 'em: For since in my time and knowledge so many rich Children Of the City conclude in beggery, i'de rather Make a wise stranger my Executor, then a foolish Sonne my Heire, and to have my Lands call'd after my Wit, thou after my name; and that's my nature. Witty. 'Tis a strange harsh one, must I still shift then? I come brave cheates, once to my trade agen, And i'le ply't harder now then e're I did for't, You'le part with nothing then, Sir? Old K. Not a jot Sir. Witty. If I should aske you blessing e're I go Sir, I think you would not give't me. O. K. Let me but heare thou liv'st by thy wits once Thou shalt have any thing, thou'rt none of mine else, Then why should I take care for thee? Witty. 'Thanke your bounty. Exit O. K. So wealth love me, and long life, I beseech it, As I do love the man that lives by his wits, He comes so neare my nature; i'me growne old now, And ev'n arriv'd at my last cheat I feare me, But 'twill make shift to bury me, by day-light too, And discharge all my Legacies, 'tis so wealthy, And never trouble any Interest money: Iv'e yet a Neece to wed, over whose steps I have plac'st a trusty watchfull Gardinesse, For feare some poore Earle steale her, 't has bin threatned To redeem morgag'd Land, but he shall misse on't; To prevent which, I have sought out a match for her, Fop of Fop-hall, he writes himselfe, I take it, The antient'st Fop in England, with whom i'me privately Compounded for the third part of her Portion, Enter Sir Gregory Fop, and Cuningham. And she seemes pleas'd, so two parts rest with me, Hee's come; Sir Gregory, welcome, what's he Sir? Sir Greg. Young Cunningham, a Norfolke Gentleman, One that has liv'd upon the Fops, my kinred, Ever since my remembrance; hee's a wit indeed, And we all strive to have him, nay, 'tis certaine Some of our name has gone to Law for him; Now 'tis my turne to keep him, and indeed Hee's plaguy chargeable as all your wits are, But I will give him over when I list, I ha us'd wits so before. O. K. Hope when y'are married Sir you'le shake him off. Sir Greg. Why what do you take me to be, old Father i'Law that shall be, do you think ile have any of the Wits hang upon me after I am married once? none of my kinred ever had before me; but where's this Neece? ist a fashion in London to marry a woman and never see her? O. K. Excuse the nicenesse Sir, that care's your friend, Perhaps had she been seen, you had never seen her; There's many a spent-thing call'd an't like your honour, That lyes in wait for her at first snap, she's a Countesse, Drawne with sixe Mares through Fleet-streete, and a Coach-man Sitting Bare-headed to their Flaunders buttocks, This whets him on. Sir Greg. Pray let's clap up the businesse Sir, I long to see her, are you sure you have her, Is she not there already? Hark, O hark. O. K. How now, what's that Sir? Sir. Greg. Every Caroach goes by, Goes ev'n toth' heart of me. O. K. Ile have that doubt eas'd Sir, Instantly eas'd, Sir Gregory, and now I think on't A toy comes i' my minde, seeing your friend there, Wee'l have a little sport, give you but way to't, And put a trick upon her, I love wit pretiously, You shall not be seene yet, wee'le stale your friend first, If't please but him to stand for the Anti-maske. Sir Greg. Puh, he shall stand for any thing, why his supper Lyes i' my breeches here, ile make him fast else. O. K. Then come you forth more unexpectedly The Maske it selfe, a thousand a yeare joynture, The cloud your friend will be then drawne away, And only you the beauty of the Play. Sir Greg. For Red and Black Ile put downe all your Fullers, Let but your Neece bring White, and we have three Cullours. Exit Sir Greg. O. K. I'me given to understand you are a Wit Sir. Cunning. I'me one that Fortune shewes small favour to Sir. O. K. Why there you conclude it, whether you will or no Sir; To tell you truth, i'me taken with a wit. Cun. Fowlers catch Woodcocks so, let not them know so much, O. K. A Pestilence mazard, a Duke Humphrey sparke Had rather lose his Dinner then his Jest, I say, I love a wit the best of all things. Cun. Alwaies except your selfe. O. K. Has gin't me twice now, Enter Neece and Guardionesse. All with a breath, I thank him; but that I love a wit I should be heartily angry; cuds, my Neece, You know the businesse with her, Cun. With a woman? 'Tis ev'n the very same it was i'me sure Five thousand yeares ago, no foole can misse it. O. K. This is the Gentleman I promist Neece, To present to your affection. Cun. 'Ware that Arrow. O. K. Deliver me the truth now of your liking. Cun. I'me spoyl'd already, that such poore leane Game Should be found out as I am. O. K. Go set too her Sirâha, ha, ha. Cun. How noble is this vertue in you Lady, Your eye may seeme to commit thousand slaughters On your dull servants, which truly tasted Conclude all in comforts. O. K. Puh. Neece. It rather shewes what a truth worth can make, Such as yours is. O. K. And that's not worth a groat, How like you him Neece? Neece. It shall appeare how well Sir, I humbly thanke you for him. O. K. Hah? ha, good gullory, he does it well ifaith, Light, as if he meant to purchase lip-land there: Hold, hold, beare off I say, slid your part hangs too long, Cun. My joyes are mockeries. Neece. Y'ave both exprest a worthy care and love Sir, Had mine owne eye been set at liberty, To make a publike choyce (beleeve my truth Sir) It could not ha done better for my heart Then your good providence has. O. K. You will say so then, Alasse sweet Neece, all this is but the scabbard, Now I draw forth the weapon. Neece. How? O. K. Sir Gregory, Approach thou Lad of thousands. Enter Sir Gregory. Sir Greg. Who calls me? Neece. What motion's this? the Modell of Ninivie? O. K. Accost her daintily now, let me advise thee. Sir Greg. I was advis'd to bestow dainty cost on you. Neece. You were ill advis'd, back, and take better counsell; You may have good for an Angell, the least cost You can bestow upon a woman Sir Trebles ten Counsellors Fees, in Lady-ware, Y'are over head and eares ere you be aware, Faith keep a Batchelour still, and go to bowles Sir, Follow your Mistris there, and prick and save Sir, For other Mistresses will make you a slave Sir. Sir Greg. So, so, I have my lerrepoop already. O. K. Why how now Neece, this is the man I tell you. Neece. He, hang him Sir, I know you do but mocke, This is the man you would say. O. K. The Devill rides I think. Cun. I must use cunning here. O. K. Make me not mad, use him with all respect, This is the man I sweare. Neece. Would you could perswade me to that; Alasse, you cannot go beyond me Unckle, You carry a Iest well I must confesse, For a man of your yeares, butâ O. K. I'me wrought beside my selfe. Cun. I never beheld comlinesse till this minute. Guar. O good sweet Sir, pray offer not those words To an old Gentlewoman. Neece. Sir. Cun. Away fifteene, Here's fifty one exceeds thee. Neece. What's the businesse? Cun. Give me these motherly creatures, come, ne're smother it, I know you are a teeming woman yet. Guard. Troth a young Gent. might do much I think Sir Cun. Go too then. Guard. And I should play my part, or I were ingratefull. Neece. Can you so soone neglect me? Cun. Hence, i'me busie. O. K. This crosse point came in luckely, impudent Baggage, Hang from the Gentleman, art thou not asham'd To be a Widowes hinderance? Cun. Are you angry Sir? O. K. You're welcome, pray court on, I shall desire Your honest wise acquaintance; vexe me not After my care and paines to finde a match for thee, Lest I confine thy life to some out chamber, Where thou shalt waste the sweetnesse of thy youth, Like a consuming light in her owne socket, And not allow'd a male creature about thee; A very Munckey thy necessity Shall prize at a thousand pound, a Chimney-sweeper At fifteene hundred. Neece. But are you serious Unckle? O. K. Serious. Neece. Pray let me looke upon the gentleman With more heed, then I did but hum him over In haste, good faith, as Lawyers Chancery sheetes; Beshrew my blood a tollerable man, Now I distinctly read him. Sir Greg. Hum, hum, hum. Neece. Say he be black, hee's of a very good pitch, Well anckled, two good confident calves, they looke As if they would not shrink at the ninth childe; The rednesse ith' face, why that's in fashion, Most of your high bloods have it, signe of greatnesse marry; 'Tis to be taken downe too with May butter, Ile send to my Lady Spend-tayle for her Medicine. Sir Greg. Lum te dum, dum, dum, de dum. Neece. Hee's qualified too, beleve me. Sir Greg. Lum te dum, de dum, de dum. Neece. Where was my judgement? Sir Greg. Lum te dum, dum, dum, te dum, te dum. Neece. Perfections cover'd messe. Sir Greg. Lum te dum, te dum, te dum. Neece. It smoakes apparantly, pardon sweet Sir The errour of my Sex. O. K. Why well said Neece, Upon submission you must pardon her now Sir. Sir Greg. Ile do't by course, do you think i'me an asse Knight? Here's first my hand, now't goes to the Seale Office. O. K. Formally finisht, how goes this Suit forward? Cun. I'me taking measure of the widowes minde Sir, I hope to fit her heart. Guard. Who would have dreamt Of a young morsell now? things come in minutes. Sir Greg. Trust him not widow, hee's a younger Brother, Hee'le sweare and lye; beleeve me hee's worth nothing. Guard. He brings more content to a woman with that nothing, Then he that brings his thousands without any thing, We have presidents for that amongst great Ladies. O. K. Come, come, no Language now shall be in fashion, But your Love-phrase the bell to procreation. Exeunt. Enter Sir Ruinous Gentry, Witty-pate, and Priscian. Witty. Pax, there's nothing puts me besides my wits, but this fourth, This lay illiterate share, there's no conscience in't. Ruin. Sir, it has ever been so where I have practis'd, and must be Sill where I am, nor has it been undeserv'd at the yeares End, and shuffle the Almanack together, vacations and Terme-times one with another, though I say't, my wife is a Woman of a good spirit, then it is no lay-share. Pris. Faith for this five yeare, Ego possum probare, I have had A hungry penurious share with em, and she has had as much As I alwayes. Witty. Present or not present? Pris. Residens aut non residens, perfidem. Witty. And what president's this for me? because your Hic &amp; hac, Turpis and Qui mihi discipulus braines (that never got any thing but by accidence and uncertainty) did allow it, therefore I must, that have grounded conclusions of wit, hereditary rules for my Father to get by. Ruin. Sir be compendious, either take or refuse, I will bate no token of my wives share, make even the last reckonings, and either so unite or here divide company. Pris. A good resolution, profecto, let every man beg his owne way, and happy man be his dole. Witty. Well, here's your double share, and single brains Pol, edipol, here's toward, a Caster ecastor for you, I will endure it a fortnight longer, but by these just five endsâ Pris. Take heed, five's odde, put both hands together or severally they are all odde unjust ends. Witty. Medius fidius, hold your tongue, I depose you from halfe a share presently else, I will make you a participle and decline you, now you understand me, be you a quiet conjunction amongst the undeclined; you and your Latine ends shall go shift, Solus cum solo together else, and then if ever they get ends of gold and silver enough to serve that Gerundine maw of yours, that without Do will end in Di &amp; Dum instantly. Enter Old Knight and Sir Gregory. Ruin. Inough, ynough, here comes company, we lose five shares in wrangling about one. Witty. My Father, put on Priscian, he has Latine fragments too, but I feare him not, ile case my face with a little more haire and releive. O. K. Tush Nephew (ile call you so) for if there be No other obstacles then those you speake of They are but powder charges without pellets, You may safely front 'em; and warrant your owne danger. Sir Greg. No other that I can perceive ifaith Sir, for I put her to't, and felt her as far as I could, and the strongest repulse was, she said, she would have a little Souldier in me, that (if need were) I should defend her reputation. O. K. And surely Sir, that is a principle Amongst your principall Ladies, they require Vallour either in a friend or a husband. Sir Greg. And I allow their requests ifaith, as well as any womans heart can desire, if I knew where to get valour, I would as willingly entertaine it as any man that blowes. O. K. Breathes, breathes Sir, that's the sweeter phrase. Sir Greg. Blowes for a Souldier, ifaith Sir, and i'me in Practise that way. O. K. For a Souldier, I grant it. Sir Greg. Slid ile swallow some bullets, and good round ones too, but ile have a little Souldier in me. Ruin. Will you on and beg, or steale and be hang'd. Sir Greg. And some Schollar she would have me besides, Tush, that shall be no bar, 'tis a quality in a Gentleman, but of the least question. Pris. Salvete Domini benignissimi, munificentissimi. O. K. Salvete dicis ad nos? Jubeo te salvere, Nay Sir, we have Latine and other mettall in us too, Sir, you shall see me talke with this fellow now. Sir Greg. I could finde in my heart to talk with him too, If I could understand him. Pris. Charissimi, Doctissimi? Domini, ex abundantia, Charitatis vestrÃ¦ estote poopitii in me junenem, Miserum, pauperem, &amp; omni consolatione exulem. O. K. A pretty Schollar by my faith Sir, but ile to him agen. Sir Greg. Does he beg or steale in this Language can you tell Sir? He may take away my good name from me, and I ne're The wiser. O. K. He begs, he begs Sir. Pris. Ecce, ecce, in oculis lacrymarum flumen, in ore Fames, sitis? ignis in vultu, pudor &amp; impudentia, In omni parte necessitas &amp; indigentia. O. K. Audi tu bonus socius, tu es Scolasticus, sic intelligo, Ego faciam argumentum, mark now Sir, now I fetch Him up. Sir Greg. I have been fetcht up a hundred times for this, Yet I could never learne halfe so much. O. K. Audi, &amp; responde, hoc est Argumentum, nomen est Nomen, ergo, quod est tibi nomen, Responde nunc, Responde argumentum meum. Have I not put him to't Sir? Sir Greg. Yes Sir, I think so. Witty. Step in, the rascall is put out of his pen'd speech, And he can go no farther. O. K. Cur non respondes? Pris. Oh Domine, tanta mea est miseria. Witty. So he's almost in agen. Pris. Ut nocte mecum pernoctat egestas, luce quotidie Paupertat habitat. O. K. Sed quod est tibi nomen, &amp; quis dedit? Responde Argumentum. Pris. Hem, hem. Witty. He's dry, he hems, on quickly. Ruin. Courteous Gentlemen, if the brow of a Military face may not be offensive to your generous eye-balls, let his wounds speake better then his words, for some branch or small sprig of charity to be planted upon this poore barren soyle of a Souldier. O. K. How now, what Armes and Arts both go a beging? Ruin. Such is the poast-progresse of cold charity now a dayes, who (for heat to her frigid limbs) passes in so swift a motion, that two at the least had need be to stay her. Sir Greg. Sir, let's reward um I pray you and be gone, if any quarrell should arise amongst us, I am able to answer neither of them, his Iron and Steele tongue is as hard as the tothers Latine one. O. K. Stay, stay Sir, I will talke a little with him first, Let me alone with both, I will try whether they Live by their wits or no; for such a man I love, And what? you both beg together then? Pris. Conjunctis manibus, profecto, Domine. Ruin. With equall fortunes equall distribution, there's not the breadth of a swords point uneven in our division. Sir Greg. What two qualities are here cast away upon two poore fellowes, if a man had um that could maintaine um, what a double man were that, if these two Fellowes might be bought and sodden, and boyl'd to a jelly, and eaten fasting every morning, I do not thinke but a man should finde strange things in his stomack. O. K. Come Sir, joyne your charity with mine, and we'le make up a couple of pence betwixt us. Sir Greg. If a man could have a penny-worth for his penny, I would bestow more money with 'em. Witty. Save you Gentlemen, how now? what are you encountred here? what fellowes are these? O. K. 'Faith Sir, here's Mars and Mercury, a paire of poore Planets it seemes, that Jupiter has turn'd out to live by their wits, and we are e'ne about a little sparke of charity to kindle um a new fire. Witty. Stay, pray you stay Sir, you may abuse your charity, nay make that goodnesse in you no better then a vice, so many deceivers walke in these shadowes now a dayes, that certainly your bounties were better spilt then reserv'd to so lewd and vicious uses; which is he that professes the Souldier? Ruin. He that professes his owne profession Sir, and the dangerous life he hath led in it this paire of halfe score yeares. Witty. In what services have you been Sir? Ruin. The first that flesht me a souldier Sir, was that great battell at Alcazar in Barbarie, where the noble English Stukely fell, and where that royall Portugall Sebastian ended his untimely dayes. Witty. Are you sure Sebastian dyed there? Ruin. Faith Sir, there was some other rumour hop't amongst us, that he wounded escap't, and touch't on his Native shore agen, where finding his Country at home more distrest by the invasion of the Spaniard then his losse abroad, forsooke it, still supporting a miserable and unfortunate life, which (where he ended) is yet uncertaine. Witty. By my faith Sir, he speakes the nearest fame of truth in this. Ruin. Since Sir, I serv'd in France, the Low Countries, lastly, at that memorable Skirmish at Newport, where the forward and bold Scot there spent his life so freely, that from every single heart that there fell, came home from his resolution a double honour to his country. Witty. This should be no counterfeit, Sir. O. K. I do not thinke he is, Sir. Witty. But Sir, me thinkes you do not shew the markes of a Souldier, could you so freely scape, that you brought home no scarres to be your chronicle? Ruin. Sir, I have wounds and many, but in those parts where nature and humanity bids me shame to publish. Witty. A good Souldier cannot want those badges. Sir Greg. Now am not I of your minde in that, for I hold him the best souldier that scapes best, alwaies at a Cocke-fencing I give him the best that has the fewest knocks. Witty. Nay ile have a bout with your Schollar too, To aske you why you should be poore (yet richly learn'd) Were no question, at least you can easily Answer it; but whether you have learning enough, To deserve to be poore or no (since poverty is Commonly the meed of Learning) is yet to be tryed; You have the Languages, I meane the chiefe, As the Hebrew, Syriack, Greeke, Latine, &amp;c. Pris. Aliquantulum, non totaliter, Domine. O. K. The Latine I have sufficiently tryed him in, And I promise you Sir he is very well grounded. Witty. I will prove him in some of the rest. Tois miois fatherois iste Cock-scomboy? Pris. Kay yonkeron niggitton oy fouleroi Asinisoy. Witty. Cheateron ton biton? Pris. Tous pollous strikerous, Angelo to peeso. Witty. Certainely Sir, a very excellent Schollar in the Greeke. O. K. I do note a wonderous readinesse in him. Sir Greg. I do wonder how the Trojans could hold out ten yeares Seige (as 'tis reported) against the Greekes, if Achilles spoke but this Tongue? I do not thinke but he might have shaken downe the walls in a seventh-night, and ne're troubled the wooden horse. Witty. I will try him so far as I can in the Syriack. Kircom bragmen, shag a dou ma dell mathou. Pris. Hashagath rabgabash shobos onoriadka. Witty. Colpack Rubasca, gnawerthem shigshag. Napshamothem Ribsbe bongomosh lasbemech nagothi. Witty. Gentlemen I have done, any man that can, go further, I confesse my selfe at a Nonplus. Sir Greg. Faith not I Sir, I was at my farthest in my naturall Language, I was never double-tongu'd I thanke my hard fortune. Witty. Well Gentlemen, 'tis pitty (walke further off a little my friends) I say, 'tis pitty such fellowes so endow'd, so qualified with the gifts of Nature and Arts, yet should have such a scarcity of fortunes benefits, we must blame our Iron-hearted age for it. O. K. 'Tis pitty indeed, and our pitty shall speake a little for 'em; Come Sir, here's my Groat. Witty. A Groat Sir? oh sie, give nothing rather, 'twere better you rayl'd on um for begging and so quit your selfe, I am a poore Gentleman, that have little but my wits to live on. O. K. Troth and I love you the better, Sir. Witty. Yet ile begin a better example then so, here fellowes, there's between you, take Purse and all, and I would it were heavier for your sakes, there's a paire of Angells to guide you to your lodgings, a poore Gentlemans good will. Pris. Gratias, maximas gratias, benignissime Domine. O. K. This is an ill example for us, Sir, I would this bountifull Gentleman had not come this way to day. Sir Greg. Pox, we must not shame our selves now, Sir, ile give as much as that Gentleman, though I never be Souldier or Schollar while I live; hero friends, there's a piece, that if he were divided would make a paire of Angells for me too, in the love I beare to the Sword and the Tongues. O. K. My largesse shall be equall too, and much good doe you, this bounty is a little abatement of my wit though, I feele that. Ruin. May souldiers ever defend such charities. Pris. And Schollars pray for their encrease. O. K. Fare you well Sir, these fellowes may pray for you, you have made the Schollars commons exceed to day, and a word with you, Sir, you said you liv'd by your wits, if you use this bounty you'le begger your wits beleeve it. Witty. Oh Sir, I hope to encrease 'em by it, this seed never wants his harvest, fare you well, Sir. Exit Sir Greg. I thinke a man were as good meet with a reasonable Thiefe, as an unreasonable Begger sometimes, I could finde in my heart to beg halfe mine back agen, can you change my piece my friends? Pris. Tempor a mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis. Sir Greg. My Gold is turn'd into Latine, Enter Witty-pate. Looke you good fellowes, here's one round Shilling more that lay conceal'd. O. K. Sir, away, we shall be drawn farther into dammage else. Sir Greg. A pox of the Foole, he live by his wits? if his wits leave him any money but what he beggs or steales very shortly, ile be hang'd for him. Exeunt the two Knights. Ruin. This breakfast parcell was well fetcht of ifaith. Witty. Tush, a by-blow for mirth, we must have better purchase, we want a fourth for another project that I have ripen'd. Ruin, My wife, she shares, and can deserve it. Witty. She can change her shape, and be masculine. Ruin. 'Tis one of the free'st conditions, she feares not the crack of a Pistoll, she dares say stand to a Grazier. Pris. Probatum fuit, profecto, Domine. Witty. Good, then you Sir Bacchus, Appollo shall be dispatcht with her share, and some contents to meete us to morrow (at a certaine place and time appointed) in the masculine Gender, my Father has a Nephew, and I an owne Cousen comming up from the University, whom he loves most indulgently, easie Master Credulous Oldcraft, (for you know what your meere Academique is) your Carrier never misses his houre, he must not be rob'd (because he has but little to lose) but he must joyne with us in a devise that I have, that shall rob my Father of a hundred pieces, and thanke me to be rid on't, for there's the ambition of my wit to live upon his profest wit, that has turn'd me out to live by my wits. Pris. Cum hirundinis alis tibi regratulor. Witty. A male habit, a bag of a hunder'd weight, though it be counters (for my Alchimy shall turne 'em into Gold of my Fathers) the houre, the place, the action, shall be at large set downe, and Father, you shall know, that I put my portion to use, that you have given me to live by; And to confirme your selfe in me renate, I hope you'le finde my wits legitimate. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Lady, Gentry, and Servants. Serv. Nay Lady. Lady. Put me not in minde on't prethee, You cannot do a greater wrong to women, For in our wants, 'tis the most chiefe affliction To have that name remembred; 'tis a title That misery workes us by, and the worlds malice, Scorne and contempt has not where with to work On humble Callings; they are safe, and lye Levell with pitty still, and pale distresse Is no great stranger to 'em; but when fortune Lookes with a stormy face on our conditions, We finde affliction worke, and envie pastime, And our worst enemy then that most abuses us, Is that we are call'd by, Lady, O my spirit, Will nothing make thee humble? I am well methinkes, And can live quiet with my fate sometimes, Untill I looke into the world agen, Then I begin to rave at my stars bitternesse, To see how many muckhills plac'd above me; Peasants and Droyles, Caroches full of Dunghills, Whose very birth stinkes in a generous nostrill, Glistring by night like Glow-wormes through the High-streets, Hurried by Torch-light in the Foot-mans hands That shew like running Fire-drakes through the City, And I put to my shifts and wits to live, Nay sometimes danger too; on Foot, on Horse-back, And earne my supper manfully ere I get it, Many a meale I have purchas'd at that rate, Enter Priscian. Fed with a wound upon me, stampt at midnight. Hah, what are you? Pris. Now you may tell your selfe Lady. Pulls off's beard. Lady. Oh Mr. Priscian, what's the project, For you ne're come without one. Pris. First, your Husband, Sir Ruinous Gentry greetes you with best wishes, And here has sent you your full share by me In five Cheates, and two Robberies. Lady. And what comes it too? Pris. Neare upon thirteene pound. Lady. A goodly share, 'Twill put a Lady scarce in Philip and Cheyney, VVith three small Bugle Laces, like a Chamber-maid, Here's pretious lifting. Pris. 'Lasse you must consider, Lady, 'Tis but young Tearm, Atturnies ha small doings yet, Then High-way Lawyers, they must needs ha little, Wee'ne had no great good luck to speake troth Beauty, Since your stout Lady-ship parted from's at Hye-gate, But there's a faire hope now for a present hunder'd, Here's mans Apparrell, your Horse stands at doore. Lady. And what's the vertuous plot now? Pris. Marry Lady, You like a brave young Gallant must be rob'd. Lady. I rob'd? Pris. Nay thenâ Lady. Well, well, go on, let's heare Sir. Pris. Here's a seal'd bag of a Hunder'd, which indeed Are Counters all, only some sixteen Groates Of white money i'the mouth on't. Lady. So, what Saddle have I? Pris. Mounsieur Laroon's the French-mans. Lady. That agen, You know so well it is not for my stride, How oft have I complain'd on't? Pris. You may have Jockey's then, the little Scotch one, You must dispatch. Exit Pris. Lady. Ile soone by ready Sir, Before you ha shifted Saddles, many women Have their wealth flow to 'em, I was made I see To help my fortune, not my fortune me. Exit. Enter Cuningame. Cun. My wayes are Goblin-led, and the night Elfe Still drawes me from my home, yet I follow, Sure 'tis not altogether fabulous, Such Haggs do get dominion of our tongues So soone as we speake, the Inchantment bindes; I have dissembled such a trouble on me, As my best wits can hardly cleare agen; Piping through this old Reede, the Gardianesse, With purpose that my harmony shall reach And please the Ladies eare, she stops below, And ecchoes back my love unto my lips, Perswaded by most violent arguments Of selfe-love in her selfe; I am so selfe-foole, To doat upon her hunder'd-wrinckl'd face; I could begger her to accept the gifts She would throw upon me; 'twere charity, But for pitties sake I will be a niggard And undo her, refusing to take from her; I'me haunted agen, if it take not now I'le breake the Spell. Enter Gardianesse. Gard. Sweet Cuningame, welcome; What? a whole day absent? Birds that build Nests Have care to keep 'em. Cun. That's granted, But not continually to sit upon 'em; Lesse in the youngling season, else they desire To fly abroad, and recreate their labours, Then they returne with fresher appetite To worke agen. Gard. Well, well, you have built a nest That will stand all stormes, you need not mistrust A weather-wrack, and one day it may be The youngling season too, then I hope You'le ne're fly out of sight. Cun. There will be paines, I see to shake this Bur off, and sweetest, Prethee how fares thy charge? has my good friend Sir Gregory the countenance of a Lover? Gard. No by my troth, not in my minde, me thinkes (Setting his Worship aside) he lookes like a foole. Cun. Nay ifaith, ne're divide his Worship from him for that Small matter; Foole and Worship are no such Strangers now adaies, but my meaning is, Has he thy Ladies countenance of love? Lookes she like a welcome on him? plainely, Have they as good hope of one another, As Cupid blesse us, we have? Gard. Troth I know not, I can perceive no forwardnesse in my charge, But I protest I wish the Knight better For your sake, Bird. Cun. Why thanks sweet Bird, and with my heart I wish, That he had as strong and likely hope of her As thou haste of me. Gard. Well, he's like to speed Ne're the worse for that good wish, and ile tell you Bird (for secrets are not to be kept betwixt us two) My charge thinkes well of you. Cun. Of me? for what? Gard. For my sake, I meane so, I have heard her A hundred times since her Unckle gave her The first bob about you, that she'de do somewhat For my sake if things went well together, We have spoke of doores and bolts, and things and things, Go too, ile tell you all, but, you'le finde Some advancement for my sake I do beleeve. Cun. Faith be not sparing, tell me. Gard. By my Lady You shall pardon me for that, 'twere a shame If men should heare all that women speakes behinde Their backes sometimes. Cun. You must give me leave yet, At least to give her thankes. Gard. Nor that neither, She must not take a notice of my blabbing, It is sufficient you shall give me thankes, For 'tis for my sake if she be bountifull, She loves me, and loves you too for my sake. Cun. How shall I knowing this but he ingrate, Not to repay her with my dearest duty. Gard. I, but you must not know it, if you tell All that I open to you, you'le shame us both; A far off you may kisse your hand, blush, or so, But i'le allow no nearer conference. Cun. Whoope! you'le be jealous I perceive now. Gard. Jealous? why there'e no true love without it, Bird, I must be jealous of thee, but for her, (Were it within my duty to my Master) I durst trust her with the strongest tempter, And I dare sweare her now as pure a Virgin As e're was welcom'd to a marriage bed, If thoughts may be untainted, hers are so. Cun. And where's the cause of your feare then? Gard. Well, well; When things are past, and the wedding Torches Lighted at matches, to kindle better fire, Then ile tell you more. Cun. Come, come, I see further, That if we were married you'de be jealous. Gard. I protest I should a little, but not of her, It is the married woman (if you mark it) And not the maid that longs, the appetite Followes the first taste, when we have relisht We wish cloying, the taste once pleas'd before, Then our desine is whetted on to more, But I reveale too much to you, ifaith Bird. Cun. Not a whit 'faith, Bird, betwixt you and I, I am beholding for bettering of my knowledge. Gard. Nay you shall know more of me if you'le be rul'd, But make not things common. Cun. Vd' so, your Lady? Gard. I, 'tis no matter, she'le like well of this, Our familiarity is her content. Enter Neece and Clowne. Nee. This present from Sir Gregory? Clow. From my Master, the Worshipfull right Sir Gregory Fop. Nee. A Ruffe? and what might be his high conceit In sending of a Ruffe? Clow. I thinke he had two conceits in it forsooth, too high too Low, Ruffe high, because as the Ruffe does embrace your necke all day, so does he desire to throw his Knightly armes. Neece. But then I leave him off a nights. Clow. Why then he is ruffe low, a ruffian, a bold adventerous errant to do any rough service for his Lady. Nee. A witty and unhappy conceit, do's he meane As he seemes to say unto that reverence? Toward Cuning. He does wooe her sure. Clow. To tell you truth Lady, his conceit was far better then I have blaz'd it yet. Nee. Do you think so, Sir? Clow. Nay I know it forsooth, for it was two dayes ere he compass'd it, to finde a fitting present for your Ladyship, he was sending once a very fine Puppy to you. Nee. And that he would have brought himselfe. Clow. So he would indeed, but then he alter'd his devise, and sent this Ruffe, requesting withall, that whensoever it is foule, you (with your owne hands) would bestow the starching of it. Nee. Else she wooes him, now his eyes shoots this way; And what was the reason for that Sir? Toward Cun. Clow. There lyes his maine conceit, Lady, for sayes he, In so doing she cannot chuse but in the starching to clap it often between her hands, and so she gives a great liking and applause to my present, whereas if I should send a Puppy; she ever calls it to her with Irist, hisse, hisse, which is a fearefull disgrace, he drew the devise from a Play, at the Bull tother day. Nee. I marry Sir, this was a rich conceit indeed. Clow. And far fetch'd, therefore good for you Lady- Gard. How now? which way looke you, Bird? Cun. At the Foole Bird shall I not look at the Foole? Gard. At the Foole and I here? what need that? pray look this way. Nee. Ile fit him aptly, either ile awake His wits (if he have any) or force him To appeare (as yet I cannot think him) Without any, Sirrah, tell me one thing true That I shall aske you now, Was this devise Your Masters owne? I doubt his wit in it; He's not so ingenious. Clow. His owne I assure you, Madam. Nee. Nay, you must not lye. Clow. Not with a Lady, i'de rather lye with you then lye with my Master, by your leave in such a case as this. Gard. Yet agen your eye? Cun. The Foole makes mirth ifaith, I would heare some. Gard. Come, you shall heare none but me. Nee. Come hither friend, nay come nearer me; did Thy Master send thee to me? he may be wise, But did not shew it much in that; men sometimes May wrong themselves unawares, when they least thinke on't; Was Uulcan ever so unwise, to send Mars To be his spokesman when he went a wooing? Send thee? heigh-ho, a pretty rowling eye. Clow. I can turne up the white and the black too, and need be, forsooth. Nee. Why, here's an amorous nose. Clow. You see the worst of my nose, forsooth. Nee. A cheek, how I could put it now in dalliance, A paire of lips, on that we were uney'd, I could suck Sugar from 'em, what a beard's here? When will the Knight thy Master have such a Stampe of man-hood on his face? nay, do not blush. Clow. 'Tis nothing but my flesh and blood that rises so. Cun. Death, she courts the Foole. Gard. Away, away, 'tis sport, do not minde it. Nee. Give me thy hand, come be familiar; I, here's a promising palme; what a soft Handfull of pleasure's here, here's Downe compar'd With Flocks and quilted Straw, thy Knights fingers Are leane mattrice rubbers to these Feathers, I prethee let me leane my cheeke upon't, What a soft pillow's here? Clow. Hum, umh, hu, hum. Neece. Why there's a courage in that lively passion, Measure thee all o're, there's not a limbe But has his full proportion; it is my voyce, There's no compare betwixt the Knight and thee, The goodlier man by halfe, at once now I see thee all over. Clow. If you had seen me swim tother day on my back, you would have sed you had seene, there was two Chambermaids that saw me, and my leggs by chance were tangled in the flags, and when they saw how I was hang'd, they cryed out, O help the man for feare he be drown'd. Neece. They could do no lesse in pitty, come, thine arme, wee'le walke together. Cun. Blindnesse of Love and Women, why she dotes upon the Foole. Gard. What's that to you, minde her not. Cun. Away you Burre. Gard. How's that? Cun. Hang of Fleshook, fasten thine itchy claspe On some dry Toad-stoole that will kindle with thee, And burne together. Gard. Oh abominable, Why do you not love me? Cun. No, never did? I tooke thee downe a little way to Enforce a Vomit from my offended stomack, Now thou'rt up agen I loath thee filthily. Gard. Oh Villaine. Cun. Why dost thou not see a sight Would make a man abjure the sight of women. Nee. Ha, ha, ha, he's vext; ha, ha, ha, Ha, ha, ha. Gard. Why dost thou laugh? Because thou laugh'st, nothing else ifaith. Cun. She has but mockt my folly, else she findes not The bosome of my purpose, some other way Must make me know; ile try her, and may chance quit The fine dexterity of her Lady-wit. Exit. Nee. Yes introth, I laught to think of thy Master, Now, what he would think if he knew this? Clow. By my troth I laugh at him too, faith Sirrah, hee's but a foole to say the truth, though I say't that should not say't. Nee. Yes, thou shouldst say truth, and I beleeve thee; Well, for this time wee'le part, you perceive something, Our tongues betray our hearts, there's our weaknesse, But pray be silent. Clow. As Mouse in Cheese, or Goose in Hay ifaith. Neece. Looke, we are cut off, there's my hand where my lips would be. Clow. Ile wink and think 'em thy lips, farewell. Exit. Nee. Now Gardionesse, I need not aske where you have been. Gard. O Lady, never was woman so abus'd Clow. Do'st thou heare Lady sweet-heart, I had forgot to tell thee, if you will I will come back in the Evening? Nee. By no meanes, come not till I send for you. Clow. If there be any need, you may think of things when I am gone, I may be convey'd into your chamber, ile lye under the bed while midnight, or so, or you shall put me up in one of your little boxes, I can creep in at a small hole. Nee. These are things I dare not venter, I charge you on my love never come till I send for you. Clow. Verbum insapienti, 'tis enough to the wise, nor I think it is not fit the Knight should know any thing yet. Nee. By no meanes, pray you go now, we are suspected. Clow. For the things that are past, let us use our secrets. Nee. Now ile make a firme triall of your love, As you love me, not a word more at this time, Not a sillable, 'tis the seale of love, take heed. Clow. Hum, hum, hum, humâ Hum's loath to depart. Exit Clown. Nee. So, this pleasant trouble's gone, now Gardianesse, What? your eyes easing your heart, the cause woman? Gard. The cause is false man, Madam, oh Lady, I have been gub'd in a shining Carbuncle, A very Glo-worme, that I thought had fire in't, And 'tis as cold as Ice. Neece. And justly serv'd, Would'st thou once think that such an erring Spring Would dote upon thine Autumne? Gard. Oh, had you heard him But protest. Nee. I would not have beleev'd him, Thou might'st have perceiv'd how I mockt thy folly, In wanton imitation with the Foole, Go weepe the sin of thy credulity, Not of thy losse, for it was never thine, And it is gaine to misse it; wert thou so dull? Nay yet thou'rt stupid and uncapable, Why thou wert but the bait to fish with, not The prey, the stale to catch another Bird with. Gard. Indeed he call'd me Bird. Nee. Yet thou perceiv'st not, It is your Neece he loves, would'st thou be made A stakling Jade? 'tis she, examine it, Ile hurry all awry, and tread my path Over unbeaten grounds, go levell to the mark, Not by circuler bouts, rare things are pleasing, And rare's but seldome in the simple sence, But has her Emphasis with eminence Exit. Gard. My Neece? she the rivall of my abuse? My flesh and blood wrong me? ile Aunt her for't; Enter Mirabell. Oh opportunity, thou blessest me Now Gentlewoman, are you parted so soone? Where's your friend I pray? your Cuningame? Mir. What say you Aunt? Gard. Come, come, your Cuningame? I am not blinde with age yet, nor deafe. Mir. Dumbe I am sure you are not, what ayld you Ant? Are you not well? Gard. No, nor sick, nor mad, nor in my wits, nor sleeping, nor walking, nor nothing, nor any thing; I know not what I am, nor what I am not. Mir. Mercy cover us, what do you meane Aunt? Gard. I meane to be reveng'd. Mir. On whom? Gard. On thee, Baggage. Mir. Revenge should follow injury, Which never reacht so far as thought in me Towards you Aunt. Gard. Your cunning, minion, Nor your Cuningame can either blinde me, The gentle Begger loves you. Mir. Beseech you, Let me stay your errour, I begin to heare, And shake off my amazement; if you think That ever any passage treating love Hath been betwixt us yet commenc't, any Silent eye-glance that might but sparkle fire, So much as brother and sister might meet with, The lip-salute, so much as strangers might Take a farewell with, the commixed hands, Nay, but the least thought of the least of these; In troth you wrong your bosome, by that truth (Which I thinke yet you durst be bayle for in me, If it were offered ye) I am as free As all this protestation. Gard. May I believe this? Mir. If ever you'l believe truth: why, I thought he had spake love to you, and if his heart prompted his tongue, sure I did heare so much. Gard. Oh falsest man, Ixions plague fell on me, Never by woman (such a masculine cloud) So airy and so subtle was embrac't. Mir. By no cause in me, by my life deere Aunt. Gard. I believe you, then help in my revenge, And you shall do't, or loose my love for ever, Ile have him quitted at his equall weapon, Thou art young, follow him, bait his desires With all the Engines of a womans wit, Stretch modesty even to the highest pitch; He cannot freeze at such a flaming beauty; And when thou hast him by the amorous gills, Thinke on my vengeance, choke up his desires, Then let his banquettings be Tantalisme, Let thy disdaine spurne the dissembler out; Oh I should clime my stars, and sit above, To see him burne to ashes in his love. Mir. This will be a strange taste, Aunt, and an Unwilling labour, yet in your injunction I am a servant to't. Gard. Thou'lt undertak't? Mir. Yes, let the successe commend it selfe hereafter. Gard. Effect it Girle, my substance is thy store, Nothing but want of will makes woman poore. Exeunt. Enter Sir Gregory, and Clowne. Sir Greg. Why Pompey, thou art not starke mad, art thou? Wilt thou not tell me how my Lady doe's? Clow. Your Lady? Sir Greg. Did she receive the thing that I sent her kindly, or no? Clow. The thing that you sent her, Knight, by the thing that you sent, was for the things sake that was sent to carry the thing that you sent, very kindly received, first, there is your Indenture, now go seeke you a servant: secondly, you are a Knight: thirdly and lastly, I am mine owne man: and fourthly, fare you well. Sir Greg. Why Pompey? prethee let me speak with thee, Ile lay my life some Haire has crost him. Clow. Knight, if you be a Knight, so keep you; as for the Lady, who shall say that she is not a faire Lady, a sweet Lady, an honest and a vertuous Lady, I will say he is a base fellow, a blab of his tongue, and I will make him eat these fingers ends. Sir Greg. Why here's no body saies so Pompey. Clow. Whatsoever things have past betweene the Lady and the other party, whom I will not name at this time, I say she is vertuous, and honest, and I will maintaine it, as long as I can maintaine my selfe with bread and water. Sir Greg. Why I know no body thinks otherwise. Clow. Any man that doe's but thinke it in my hearing, I will make him thinke on't while he has a thought in his Bosome; shall we say that kindnesses from Ladies are common? or that favours and protestations are things of no moment betwixt parties and parties? I say still, whatsoever has been betwixt the Lady and the party which I will not name, that she is honest, and shall be honest, whatsoever she doe's by day or by night, by light or by darknesse, with cut and long tale. Sir Greg. Why I say she is honest. Clow. Is she honest? in what sense do you say she is honest, Knight? Sir Greg. If I could not finde in my heart to throw my Dagger at thy head, hilts and all, I'me an asse, and no Gentleman. Clow. Throw your Dagger at me! do not Knight, I give you faire warning, 'tis but cast away if you do, for you shall have no other words of me, the Lady is an honest Lady, whatsoever reports may go of sports and toyes, and thoughts, and words, and deeds, betwixt her and the party which I will not name; this I give you to understand, That another man may have as good an eye, as amorous a nose, as faire a stampt beard, and be as proper a man as a Knight, (I name no parties) a Servingman may be as good as a Sir, a Pompey as a Gregory, a Doodle as a Fop; so Servingman Pompey Doodle may be respected as well with Ladies (though I name no parties) as Sir Gregory Fop; so farewell. Exit. Sir Greg. If the fellow be not out of his wits, then will I never have any more wit while I live; either the sight of the Lady has gaster'd him, or else he's drunke, or else he walks in his sleepe, or else he's a foole, or a knave, or both, one of the three I'me sure 'tis; yet now I think on't, she has not us'd me so kindly as her Uncle promis'd me she should, but that's all one, he saies I shall have her, and I dare take his word for the best Horse I have, and that's a weightier thing then a Lady, I'me sure on't. Exit. Enter Lady Ruinous (as a man) Witty Pate, Sir Ruinous, Priscian, and Master Credulous, (binding and robing her, and in Scarfes) Credulous findes the bagge. Lady Ruin. Nay, I am your owne, 'tis in your pleasure How you'l deale with me; yet I would intreat, You will not make that which is bad enough, Worse then it need be, by a second ill, When it can render you no second profit; If it be coyne you seeke, you have your prey, All my store, I vow, (and it weighs a hundred) My life, or any hurt you give my body, Can inrich you no more. Witty. You may pursue. L. Ruin. As I am a Gentlewoman, I never will, Onely wee'l binde you to quiet behaviour Till you call out for Bayle, and on th'other Side of the hedge leave you; but keep the peace Till we be out of hearing, for by that We shall be out of danger, if we come back, We come with a mischiefe. Lady. You need not feare me. Pris. Come, wee'l bestow you then. Exit Ruin. Pris. and Lady. Wit. Why law you Sir, is not this a swifter Revenue then Sic probas ergo's &amp; igitur's can bring in? why is not this one of your Syllogismes in Barbara? Omne utile est honestum. Cred. Well Sir, a little more of this acquaintance, Will make me know you fully I protest. Wit. You have (at first sight) made me conscious Of such a deed my dreames ne're prompted, yet I could almost have wisht rather ye'ad rob'd me Of my Cloake, (for my Purse 'tis a Schollers) Then to have made me a robber. Cred. I had rather have answered three difficult questions, Then this one, as easie as yet it seems. Witty. Tush, you shall never come to further answer for't; Can you confesse your penurious Uncle, In his full face of love, to be so strict A Nigard to your Commons, that you are faine To size your belly out with shoulder fees? With Rumps and Kidneyes, and cues of single Beere, And yet make Dayney to feed more daintily, At this easier rate? fie Master Credulous, I blush for you. Cred. This is a truth undeniable. Wit. Why go to then, I hope I know your Uncle, How doe's he use his Sonne, nearer then you? Cred. Faith like his Jade, upon the bare Commons, Turn'd out to pick his living as he can get it; He would have been glad to have shar'd in such A purchase, and thankt his good fortune too; Enter Ruinous, and Priscian. But mum no moreâis all safe, Bullies? Secure? the Gentleman thinks him most happy in his losse, With his safe life and limbs, and redoubles His first vow, as he is a Gentleman, Never to pursue us. Wit. Well away then, Disperse you with Master Credulous, who still Shall beare the purchase, Priscian and I Will take some other course: You know our meeting At the Three Cups in Saint Gyles, with this proviso, (For 'tis a Law with us) that nothing be open'd Till all be present, the looser saies a hundred, And it can weigh no lesse. Ruin. Come, Sir, wee'l be your guide. Cred. My honesty, which till now was never forfeited, All shall be close till our meeting. Exit Cred. and Ruin. Wit. Tush, I believ't, And then all shall out; where's the theefe that's rob'd? Enter Lady Ruinous. L. Ruin. Here Master Oldcraft, all followes now. Wit. 'Twas neatly done, wench, now to turne that bag Of counterfets to current pieces, &amp; actum est. L. Ruin. You are the Chymist, wee'l blow the fire still, If you can mingle the ingredients. Wit. I will not misse a cause, a quantity, a dram, You know the place. Pris. I have told her that, Sir. Wit. Good, turne Ruinous to be a Constable, I'me sure We want not beards of all sorts, from the Worshipfull Magistrate to the under Watchman; Because we must have no danger of life, But a cleanly cheat, attach Credulous, The cause is plaine, the theft found about him; Then fall I in his owne Cozens shape By meere accident, where finding him distrest, I with some difficulty must fetch him off, With promise that his Uncle shall shut up all With double restitution: Master Constable, Ruinous His mouth shall be stop't; you, Mistris rob theefe, Shall have your share of what we can gull my father of; Is't plaine enough? L. Ruin. As plaine a cozenage as can be, faith. Wit. Father, I come againe, and againe when this is Past too, Father, one will beget another; I'de be loath to leave your posterity barren, You were best to come to composition Father, Two hundred pieces yearly allow me yet, It will be cheaper (Father) then my wit, For I will cheate none but you, deare Father.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Old Knight and Sir Gregory. O. K. Why now you take the course Sir Gregory Fop: I could enforce her and I list, but love That's gently wonne; is a mans owne for ever, Have you prepar'd good musick? Sir Greg. As fine a noyse, Uncle, as heart can wish: O. K. Why that's done like a Suitor, They must be woo'd a hundred severall waies, Before you obtaine the right way in a woman, 'Tis an odde creature, full of creeks and windings. The Serpent has not more; for sh'as all his, And then her owne beside came in by her mother. Sir Greg. A fearefull portion for a man to venter on. O. K. But the way found once by the wits of men, There is no creature lyes so tame agen. Sir Greg. I promise you, not a house-Rabbit, Sir. O. K. No sucker on 'em all. Sir Greg. What a thing 's that? They're pretty Fooles I warrant, when they're tame As a man can lay his lips to. O. K. How were you bred, Sir? Did you never make a foole of a Tenants daughter? Sir Greg. Never i'faith, they ha' made some fooles for me, And brought 'em many a time under their aprons. O. K. They could not shew you the way plainlier, I thinke, To make a foole againe. Sir Greg. There's fooles enough, Sir, Lesse they were wiser. O. K. This is wondrous rare, Come you to London with a Maiden-head, Knight? A Gentleman of your ranke ride with a Cloak-bag? Never an Hostesse by the way to leave it with; Nor Tapsters sister? nor head Ostlers wife? What no body? Sir Greg. Well mockt old Wit Monger, I keep it for your Neece. O. K. Do not say so for shame, shee'l laugh at thee, A wife ne're looks for't, 'tis a Batchellors penny, He may giv't to a beggar-wench, i'th progresse time, And never call'd to account for't. Exit. Sir Greg. Would I'de knowne so much, I could ha' stopt a beggars mouth by'th way, Enter Page. That rail'd upon me cause I'de give her nothingâ What, are they come? Pag. And plac'd directly, Sir, Under her window. Sir Greg. What may I call you Gentleman? Boy. A poore servant to the Violl, I'me the Voyce, Sir. Sir Greg. In good time Master Voyce. Boy. Indeed good time doe's get the mastery. Sir Greg. What Countryman Master Voyce? Boy. Sir, borne at Ely, we all set up in Ely, But our house commonly breakes in Rutland Shire. Sir Greg. A shrewd place by my faith, it may well break your voyce, It breaks many a mans back; come, set to your businesse. Song. Faine would I wake you, Sweet, but feare I should invite you to worse cheare; In your dreames you cannot fare Meaner then Musick; no compare; None of your slumbers are compil'de Under the pleasure makes a childe; Your day-delights, so well compact, That what you think, turnes all to act: I'de wish my life no better play, Your dreame by night, your thought by day. Wake gently, wake, Part softly from your dreames; The morning flies To your faire eyes, To take her speciall beames: Sir Greg. I heare her up, here Master Voyce, Pay you the Instruments, save what you can, Enter Neece above. To keep you when you're crackt. Exit Boy. Neece. Who should this be? That I'me so much beholding to, for sweetnesse? Pray Heaven it happens right. Sir Greg. Good morrow Mistris. Neece. An ill day and a thousand come upon thee. Sir Greg. 'Light that's sixe hundred more then any Almanack has. Neece. Comes it from thee? it is the mangiest Musick That ever woman heard. Sir Greg. Nay say not so Lady, There's not an itch about 'em. Neece. I could curse My attentive powers, for giving entrance to't; There is no boldnesse like the impudence That's lock't in a fooles blood, how durst you do this? In conscience I abus'd you as sufficiently As woman could a man; insatiate Coxcombe, The mocks, and spitefull language I have given thee, Would a' my life ha' serv'd ten reasonable men, And rise contented too, and left enough for their friends. You glutten at abuses, never satisfied? I am perswaded thou devour'st more flouts Then all thy body's worth, and still a hungred! A mischiefe of that mawe; prethee seeke elsewhere, Introth I am weary of abusing thee; Get thee a fresh Mistris, thou't make worke enough; I do not thinke there's scorne enough in Towne To serve thy turne, take the Court Ladies in, And all their women to 'em, that exceed 'em. Sir Greg. Is this in earnest, Lady? Neece. Oh unsatiable! Dost thou count all this but an earnest yet? I'de thought I'de paid thee all the whole summe, trust me; Thou't begger my derision utterly If thou stai'st longer, I shall want a laugh: If I knew where to borrow a contempt Would hold thee tack, stay and be hang'd thou should'st then, But thou'st no conscience now to extort hate from me, When one has spent all she can make upon thee; Must I begin to pay thee hire againe? After I have rid thee twice? faith 'tis unreasonable. Sir Greg. Say you so? I'le know that presently. Exit. Neece. Now he runs To fetch my Uncle to this musty bargaine, But I have better ware alwaies at hand. And lay by this still when he comes to cheapen. Enter Cuningame. Cun. I met the Musick now, yet cannot learne What entertainment he receiv'd from her. Nee. There's some body set already, I must to't, I see, Well, well, Sir Gregory. Cun. Hah, Sir Gregory? Neece. Where e're you come you may well boast your conquest. Cun. She's lost y'faith, enough, has fortune then Remembred her great boy? she seldome failes 'em. Neece. He was the unlikeliest man at first, me thought, To have my love, we never met but wrangled, Cun. A pox upon that wrangling, say I still, I never knew it faile yet, where er't came; It never comes but like a storme of haile, 'Tis sure to bring fine weather at the tayle on't, There's not one match 'mongst twenty made without it, It fights i'th tongue, but sure to agree i'th haunches. Neece. That man that should ha' told me, when time was, I should ha' had him, had been laught at pitteously, But see how things will change? Cun, Here's a heart feeles itâO the deceitfull promises of love! What trust should a man put i'th lip of woman? She kist me with that strength, as if sh'ad meant To ha' set the faire print of her soule upon me. Neece. I would ha' sworne 'twould ne're ha' beene a match once. Cun. Ile heare no more, I'me mad to heare so much, Why should I aime my thoughts at better fortunes Then younger brothers have? that's a Maid with nothing, Or some old Soap-boylers Widow, without teeth, There waits my fortune for me, seeke no farther. Exit Cun. Enter Old Knight, and Sir Gregory. O. K. You tell me things, Sir Gregory, that cannot be, She will not, nor she dares not. Sir Greg. Would I were whipt then. Neece. Ile make as little show of love, Sir Gregory, As ever woman did, you shall not know You have my heart a good while. O. K. Heard you that? Neece. Man will insult so soone, 'tis his condition, 'Tis good to keep him off as long as we can, I've much a do, I sweare; and love i'th end Will have his course, let Maids do what they can, They are but fraile things, till they end in man. O. K. What say you to this, Sir? Sir Greg. This is somewhat handsome. Neece. And by that little wrangling that I fain'd, Now I shall try how constant his love is, Although't went sore against my heart to chide him. Sir Greg. Alas poore Gentlewoman. O. K. Now y'are sure of truth, You heare her owne thoughts speak. Sir Greg. They speake indeed. O. K. Go, you're a brainelesse Coxe, a Toy, a Fop, Ile go no farther then your name, Sir Gregory, Ile right my self there; were you from this place, You should perceive I'me heartily angry with you, Offer to sowe strife 'twixt my Neece and I? Good morrow Neece, good morrow. Neece. Many faire ones to you, Sir. O. K. Go, your'e a Coxcombe. How dost Neece this morning? An Idle shallow foole: Slep'st thou well, Girle? Fortune may very well provide thee Lordships, For honesty has left thee little manners. Sir Greg. How am I bang'd a' both sides? O. K. Abuse kindnesse? Wil't take the ayre to day Neece? Neece. When you please, Sir, There stands the Heyre behinde you I must take, (Which I'de as live take, as take him I sweare.) O. K. La' you; do you hear't continued to your teeth now? A pox of all such Gregories; what a hand Neece lets fall her Scarfe. Have I with you? Sir Greg. No more y'feck, I ha' done, Sir: Lady, your Scarfe's falne downe. Neece. 'Tis but your luck, Sir, And doe's presage the Mistris must fall shortly, You may weare it, and you please. O. K. There's a trick for you, You'r parlously belov'd, you should complaine. Sir Greg. Yes, when I complaine, Sir, Then do your worst, there Ile deceive you Sir. O. K. You are a Dolt, and so I leave you, Sir. Exit. Sir Greg. Ah sirra, Mistris, were you caught y'faith? We overheard you all; I must not know I have your heart, take heed a that, I pray, I knew some Scarfe would come. Neece. He's quite gone, sure: Ah you base Coxcomb, couldst thou come againe? And so abus'd as thou wast? Sir Greg. How? Neece. 'Twould ha' kill'd A sensible man, he would ha' gone to his Chamber, And broke his heart by this time. Sir Greg. Thank you heartily. Neece. Or fixt a naked rapier in a wall, Like him that earn'd his Knighthood e're he had it, And then refus'd upon't, ran up to'th hilts. Sir Greg. Yes, let him run for me, I was never brought up to't, I never profest running i' my life. Neece. What art thou made on? thou tough villanous vermin, Will nothing destroy thee? Sir Greg. Yes, yes, assure your selfe Unkinde words may do much. Neece. Why, dost thou want 'em? I've e'ne consum'd my spleene to help thee to 'em, Tell me what sort of words they be would speed thee? Ile see what I can do yet. Sir Greg. I'me much beholding to you, Your'e willing to bestow huge paines upon me. Neece. I should account nothing too much to rid thee. Sir Greg. I wonder you'd not offer to destroy me, All the while your Uncle was here? Neece. Why there thou betray'st thy house, we of the Old-Crafts Were borne to more wit then so. Sir Greg. I weare your favour here. Neece. Would it might rot thy arme off: if thou knewst With what contempt thou hast it, what hearts bitternesse, How many cunning curses came along with it, Thoud'st quake to handle it. Sir Greg. A pox, tak't againe then; Who'd be thus plagu'd of all hands? Nee. No, weare't still, But long I hope thou shalt not, 'tis but cast Upon thee, purposely to serve another That has more right to't, as in some Countries they convey Their treasure upon Asses to their friends, If mine be but so wise and apprehensive As my opinion gives him to my heart, It stayes not long on thy desertlesse arme; Ile make thee e're I ha' done not dare to weare Any thing of mine, although I give't thee freely; Kisse it you may, and make what shew you can, But sure you carry't to a worthier man, And so good morrow to you. Sir Greg. Hu hum, ha hum; I han't the spirit now to dash my braines out, Nor the audacity to kill my selfe, But I could cry my heart out, that's as good, For so't be out no matter which way it comes, If I can dye with a fillip, or depart At hot cockles, what's that to any man? If there be so much death that serves my turne there. Every one knowes the state of his owne body, No Carrion kills a Kite, but then agen There's Cheese will choak a Daw; time I were dead ifaith, If I knew which way without hurt or danger. I am a Maiden-Knight, and cannot looke Upon a naked weapon with any modesty, Else 'twould go hard with me, and to complaine To Sir Perfidious the old Knight agen, Were to be more abus'd; perhaps he would beat me well, But ne're beleeve me; Enter Cuningame. And few men dye a beating, that were lost too: Oh, here's my friend, ile make my moane to him. Cun. I cannot teare her memory from my heart, That treads mine downe, was ever man so fool'd That profest wit? Sir Greg. O Cuningame? Cun. Sir Gregory? The choyce, the Victor, the Townes happy man? Sir Greg. Sniggs, what dost meane? come I to thee for comfort, and dost abuse me too? Cun. Abuse you? how Sir? With justifying your fortune, and your joyes? Sir Greg. Pray hold your hand, Sir i've bin bold enough, You come with a new way now; strike me merrily, But when a man's sore beaten a both sides already, Then the least tap in jest goes to the guts on him; Wilt ha the truth? i'me made the ranckest asse That e're was borne to Lordships. Cun. What? no Sir; Sir Greg. I had not thought my body could a yeelded All those foule scurvie names that she has call'd me, I wonder whence she fecht 'em? Cun. Is this credible? Sir Greg. She pin'd this scarfe upon me afore her Unckle, But his back turn'd, she curst me so for wearing on't, The very brawne of mine arme has ak'd ever since, Yet in a manner forc't me to weare't still, But hop't I should not long; if good luck serve I should meet one that has more wit and worth Should take it from me, 'twas but lent to me, And sent to him for a token. Cun. I conceit it, I know the man That lyes in wait for't, part with't by all meanes, In any case, you are way-laid about it. Sir Greg. How Sir? way-laid? Cun. Pox of a Scarfe say I, I prize my friends life 'bove a million on 'em, You shall be rul'd, Sir, I know more then you. Sir Greg. If you know more then I, let me be rid on't, Lasse 'tis not for my wearing, so she told me. Cun. No, no, give me't, the knave shall misse his purpose, And you shall live. Sir Greg. I would, as long as I could, Sir. Cun. No more replyes, you shall, Ile prevent this, Pompey shall march without it. Sir Greg. What, is't he? My man that was? Cun. Call him your deadly Enemy; You give him too faire a name, you deale too nobly, He beares a bloody minde, a cruell foe, Sir, I care not if he heard me. Sir Greg. But do you heare, Sir? Can't sound with reason she should affect him? Cun. Do you talk of reason? I never thought to have heard Such a word come from you; reason in love? Would you give that, no Doctor could e're give? Has not a Deputy married his Cooke-maid? An Aldermans Widow one that was her turne broach? Nay, has not a great Lady brought her Stable Into her Chamber: lay with her Horse-keeper? Sir Greg. Did ever love play such Jades tricks, Sir? Cun. Oh thousands, thousands: Beware a sturdy Clown ere while you live, Sir; 'Tis like a huswifery in most Shires about us; You shall ha' Farmers widowes wed thinne Gentlemen, Much like your selfe, but put 'em to no stresse; What worke can they do, with small trap-stick leggs? They keep Clownes to stop gaps, and drive in peggs, A drudgery fit for Hindes, e'ne back agen, Sir, You'r safest at returning. Sir Greg. Thinke you so, Sir? Cun. But how came this Clowne to be cal'd Pompey first? Sir Greg. Push, one good man CÃ¦sar, a Pump-maker kersen'd him; Pompey he writes himselfe, but his right name's Pumpey, And stunke too when I had him, now he's cranke. Cun. I'me glad I know so much to quell his pride, Sir, Walke you still that way, Ile make use of this, To resolve all my doubts, and place this favour On some new Mistris, only for a try, And if it meet my thoughts, Ile sweare 'tis I. Exit. Sir Greg. Is Pompey growne so malepert? so frampell? The onely cutter about Ladies honours? Enter Old Knight. And his blade soonest out? O. K. Now, what's the newes, Sir? Sir Gre. I dare not say but good; oh excellent good, Sir. O. K. I hope now you'r resolv'd she loves you, Knight? Sir Gr. Cuds me, what else Sir? that's not to do now. O. K. You would not think how desperately you anger'd me, When you belyed her goodnesse; oh you vext me, Even to a Palsey. Sir Greg. What a thing was that, Sir? Enter Neece. Nee. 'Tis, that 'tis; as I have hope of sweetnes, the Scarfe's gone; Worthy wise friend, I doat upon thy cunning, We two shall be well matcht, our Issue male, sure Will be borne Counsellors; is't possible? Thou shalt have another token out of hand for't; Nay since the way's found, pitty thou shouldst want, y'faith, O my best joy, and dearest. O. K. Well said, Neece, So violent fore your Uncle? what will you do In secret then? Sir Greg. Marry call me slave, and rascall. Neece. Your Scarfeâthe Scarfe I gave youâ O. K. Masse that's true Neece, I ne're thought upon that; the Scarfe she gave you-Sir? What dumbe? no answer from you? the Scarfe? Sir Greg. I was way-laid about it, my life threatned; Life's life, Scarfe's but a Scarfe, and so I parted from't. Neece. Unfortunate woman! my first favour too? O. K. Will you be still an asse? no reconcilement Twixt you and wit? are you so far fallen out, You'l never come together? I tell you true, I'me very lowsily asham'd on you, That's the worst shame that can be; Thus bayting on him: now his heart's hook't in, Ile make him, e're I ha' done, take her with nothing, I love a man that lives by his wits alife; Nay leave, sweet Neece, 'tis but a Scarfe, let it go. Neece. The going of it never grieves me, Sir. It is the manner, the mannerâ Sir Greg. O dissembling Marmaset! if I durst speake, Or could be believ'd when I speake, What a tale could I tell, to make haire stand upright now? Neece. Nay, Sir, at your request you shall perceive, Uncle, With what renewing love I forgive this? Here's a faire Diamond, Sir, Ile try how long You can keep that? Sir Greg. Not very long, you know't too, Like a cunning witch as you are. Neece. Y'are best let him ha' that too. Sir Greg. So I were, I think, there were no living else, I thank you, as you have handled the matter. O. K. Why this is musicall now, and Tuesday next Shall tune your Instruments, that's the day set. Neece. A match, good Uncle. O. K. Sir, you heare me too? Sir Greg. Oh very well, I'me for you. Neece. What e're you heare, you know my minde. Exeunt Old Knight, and Neece. Sir Gre. I aâon't, too well, if I do not wonder how we two shall come together, I'me a beare whelpe? he talks of Tuesday next, as familiarly as if we lov'd one another, but 'tis as unlikely to me, as 'twas seven yeare before I saw her; I shall try his cunning, it may be he has a way was never yet thought on, and it had need to be such a one, for all that I can thinke on will never do't; I looke to have this Diamond taken from me very speedily, therefore Ile take it off a my finger, for if it be seene, I shall be way-laid for that too.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Scena Prima. Enter Old Knight and Witty-Pate. O. K. Oh torture! torture! thou carriest a sting i'thy taile, Thou never brought'st good news i'thy life yet, And that's an ill quality, leave it when thou wilt. Witty. Why you receive a blessing the wrong way, Sir, Call you not this good newes? to save at once Sir Your credit and your kinsmans life together; Would it not vexe your peace, and gaule your worth? T'have one of your name hang'd? O. K. Peace, no such words, boy. Wit. Be thankfull for the blessing of prevention then. O. K. Le' me see, there was none hang'd out of our house since Brute, I ha' search't both Stowe, and Hollinshead. Wit. O Sir. O. K. Ile see what Polychronicon saies anon too. Wit. 'Twas a miraculous fortune that I heard on't. O. K. I would thou'dst never heard on't, Wit. That's true too, So it had ne're been done; to see the luck on't, He was ev'n brought to Justice Aurums threshold, There had flewen forth a Mittimus straight for Newgate; And note the fortune too, Sessions a Thursday, Jury cul'd out a Friday, Judgement a Saturday, Dungeon a Sunday, Tyburne a Munday, Miseries quotidian ague, when't begins once, Every day puls him, till he pull his last. O. K. No more, I say, 'tis an ill theame: where left you him? Wit. He's i'th Constables hands below i'th Hall, Sir, Poore Gentleman, and his accuser with him. O. K. What's he? Wit. A Judges Sonne, 'tis thought so much the worse too, He'l hang his enemy, an't shall cost him nothing, That's a great priviledge. O. K. Within there? Enter Servant. Serv. Sir? O. K. Call up the folks i'th Hall. I had such hope on him, For a Scholler too, a thing thou ne're wast fit for, Therefore erected all my joyes in him; Got a Welch Benefice in reversion for him, Deane of Cardigan, has his grace already, He can marry and bury, yet ne're a haire on's face; Enter Credulous, Sir Ruinous (as a Constable,) and Lady Gentry (as a man.) Like a French Vicar, and doe's he bring such fruits to Town with him? A thiefe at his first lighting? Oh good den to you. Wit. Nay, sweet Sir, you'r so vext now, you'l grieve him, And hurt your selfe. O. K. Away, Ile heare no counsell; Come you but once in seven yeare to your Uncle, And at that time must you be brought home too? And by a Constable? Wit. Oh speake low, Sir, Remember your owne credit, you professe You love a man a' wit, begin at home, Sir, Expresse it i' your self. Lady. Nay, Master Constable, Shew your self a wise man, 'gainst your nature too. Ruin. Sir, no Dish-porridgement, we have brought home As good men as ye. O. K. Out, a North-Brittaine Constable, that tongue Will publish all, it speaks so broad already; Are you the Gentlewoman? Lady. The unfortunate one, Sir, That fell into the power of mercilesse thieves, Whereof this fellow, whom I'de call your kinsman, As little as I could, (for the faire reverence I owe to fame and yeares) was the prime villaine. O. K. A wicked prime. Wit. Nay, not so loud, sweet father. Lad. The rest are fled, but I shall meet with 'em, Hang one of 'em I will certaine, I ha' swore it, And 'twas my luck to light upon this first. O. K. A Cambridge man for this? these your degrees, Sir? Nine yeares at University for this fellowship? Wit. Take your voyce lower, deare Sir. O. K. What's your losse, Sir? Lady. That which offends me to repeat, the Money's whole, Sir, 'Tis i'the Constables hands there, a seal'd hundred, But I will not receive it. O. K. No? not the money, Sir, Having confest 'tis all? Lady. 'Tis all the Money, Sir, But 'tis not all I lost, for when they bound me, They tooke a Diamond hung at my shirt string, Which feare of life made me forget to hide; It being the sparkling witnesse of a Contract 'Twixt a great Lawyers daughter and my selfe. Wit. I told you what he was; what does the Diamond Concerne my Cozen, Sir? Lady. No more did the Money, But he shall answer all now. Wit. There's your conscience, It shewes from whence you sprung. Lady. Sprung? I had leapt a thiefe, Had I leapt some of your alliance. Wit. Slave! Lady. You prevent me still. O. K. 'Slid, sonne are you mad? Lady. Come, come, Ile take a legall course. O. K. Will you undo us all? what's your demand, Sir? Now we're in's danger too. Lady. A hundred Marke, Sir, I will not bate a doit. Witty. A hundred rascals. Lady. Sir, finde 'em out in your own blood, and take 'em. Wit. Go take your course, follow the Law, and spare not. O. K. Does fury make you drunke? know you what you say? Wit. A hundred dogs dungs, do your worst. O. K. You do I'me sure; whose loud now? Wit. What his owne asking? O. K. Not in such a case? Wit. You shall have but three score pound; spite a your teeth, Ile see you hangd first. O. K. And whats seven pound more man? That all this coyle's about? stay, I say, he shall ha't. Wit. It is your owne, you may do what you please with it; Pardon my zeale, I would ha sav'd you money; Give him all his owne asking? O. K. What's that to you, Sir? Be sparing of your owne, teach me to pinch In such a case as this? go, go, live by your wits, go. Wit. I practise all I can. O. K. Follow you me, Sir, And Master Constable come from the knave, And be a witnesse of a full recompence. Wit. Pray stop the Constables mouth, what ere you do. Sir O. K. Yet agen? as if I meant not to do that my selfe, Without your counsell? As for you, precious kinsman, Your first years fruits in Wales shall go to rack for this, You lye not in my house, Ile pack you out, And pay for your lodging rather. Exeunt Knight, Ruin. and Lady. Witty. Oh fie Cozen, These are ill courses, you a Scholler too. Cred. I was drawne into't most unfortunately, By filthy deboyst company. Wit. I, I, I, 'Tis even the spoile of all our youth in England; What were they Gentlemen? Cred. Faith so like, some on 'em, They were ev'n the worse agen. Wit. Hum. Cred. Great Tobacco swivers, They would go neere to rob with a pipe in their mouths. Wit. What, no? Cred. Faith leave it Cozen, because my rascals use it, Wit. So they do meat and drinke, must worthy Gentlemen Refraine their food for that? an honest man May eat of the same pig some Parson dines with, A Lawyer and a foole feed of one Woodcock, Yet one ne're the simpler, t'other ne're the wiser; 'Tis not meat, drinke, or smoak, dish, cup, or pipe, Co-operates to the making of a knave, 'Tis the condition makes a slave, a slave, There's London Philosophy for you; I tell you cozen, You cannot be too cautelous, nice, or dainty, In your society here, especially When you come raw from the University, Before the world has hardned you a little, For as a butter'd loafe is a Schollers breakfast there, So a poacht Scholler is a cheaters dinner here, I ha' knowne seven of 'em supt up at a Meale. Cred. Why a poacht Scholler? Wit. Cause he powres himself forth, And all his secrets, at the first acquaintance, Never so crafty to be eaten i'th shell, But is outstript of all he has at first, And goes downe glibb, he's swallowed with sharp wit, Stead of Wine Vinegar. Cred. I shall think, Cozen, A' your poch't Scholler, while I live. Enter Servant. Serv. Master Credulous, Your Uncle wills you to forbeare the House, You must with me, I'me charg'd to see you plac'd In some new lodging about Theeving Lane, What the conceit's, I know not, but commands you To be seene here no more, till you heare further. Cred. Here's a strange welcome, Sir. Wit. This is the world, Cozen; When a mans fame's once poyson'd, fare thee well Lad. Exit Cred. and Servant. This is the happiest cheat I e're claim'd share in, It has a two fold fortune, gets me coyne, And puts him out of grace, that stood between me, My fathers Cambridge Jewell, much suspected To be his Heyre, now there's a barre in's hopes. Enter Ruinous, and Lady Gentry. Ruin. It chinks, make haste. Lady. The Goat at Smithfield Pens. Enter Cunningame (with a Letter.) Wit. Zo, zo, zufficient. Master Cunningame? I never have ill luck when I meet a wit. Cun. A wit's better to meet, then to follow then, For I ha' none so good I can commend yet, But commonly men unfortunate to themselves, Are luckiest to their friends, and so may I be. Wit. I run o're so much worth, going but in haste from you, All my deliberate friendship cannot equall. Cun. 'Tis but to shew that you can place sometimes, Enter Mirabell. Your modesty a top of all your vertues. Exit Wit. This Gentleman may pleasure me yet agen; I am so haunted with this broad brim'd hat, Of the last progresse block, with the young hat-band, Made for a sucking Devill of two yeare old, I know not where to turne my selfe. Mir, Sir? Cun. More torture? Mir. 'Tis rumor'd that you love me. Cun. A my troth Gentlewoman, Rumour's as false a knave as ever pist then, Pray tell him so from me; I cannot faine With a sweet Gentlewoman, I must deale downe right. Mir. I heard, though you dissembled with my Aunt, Sir, And that makes me more confident. Cun. There's no falshood, But paies us our owne some way, I confesse I fain'd with her, 'twas for a weightier purpose, But not with thee, I sweare. Mir. Nor I with you then, Although my Aunt enjoyn'd me to dissemble, To right her splene, I love you faithfully. Cun. Light, this is worse then 'twas. Mir. I finde such worth in you, I cannot, nay I dare not dally with you, For feare the flame consume me. Cun. Here's fresh trouble, This drives me to my conscience, for 'tis fowle To injure one that deales directly with me. Mir. I crave but such a truth from your love, Sir, As mine brings you, and that's proportionable. Cun. A good Geometrician, shrew my heart; Why are you out a' your wits, pretty plumpe Gentlewoman, You talk so desperately? 'tis a great happinesse, Love has made one on's wiser then another, We should be both cast away else; Yet I love gratitude, I must requite you, I shall be sick else, but to give you me, A thing you must not take, if you meane to live, For a' my troth I hardly can my selfe; No wise Physitian will prescribe me for you. Alas your state is weake, you had need of Cordials Some rich Electuary, made of a Sonne an Heire, An elder brother in a Cullisse, whole, 'T must be some wealthy Gregory, boyl'd to a Jelly, That must restore you to the state of new Gownes, French Ruffs, and mutable head tires, Mir. But where is he, Sir? One that's so rich will ne're wed me with nothing. Cun. Then see thy conscience and thy wit together, Wouldst thou have me then, that has nothing neither? What say you to Fop Gregory the first yonder? Will you acknowledge your time amply recompenc'd? Full satisfaction upon loves record? Without any more suit, if I combine you? Mir. Yes, by this honest kisse. Cun. You'r a wise Clyent, To pay your fee before hand, but all do so, You know the worst already, that's thee best too. Mir. I know he's a foole, Cun. You'r shrewdly hurt then; This is your comfort, your great wisest women Pick their first husband still out of that house, And some will have 'em to chuse, if they bury 20. Mir. I'me of their mindes, that like him for a first husband, To run youths race with him, 'tis very pleasant, But when I'me old, I'de alwaies wish a wiser. You may have me by that time; for this first businesse, Rest upon my performance. Mir. With all thankfulnesse. Cun. I have a project you must aid me in too. Mir. You binde me to all lawfull action, Sir, Pray weare this scarfe about you; I conjecture nowâ Cun. There's a Court principle for't, one office must help another; As for example, for your cast a Manchits out a'th Pantry, Ile allow you a Goose out a'th Kitchin. Mir. 'Tis very sociably done, Sir, farewell performance, I shall be bold to call you so. Cun. Do, sweet confidence, Enter Sir Gregory. If I can match my two broad brim'd hats; 'Tis he, I know the Maggot by his head; Now shall I learne newes of him, my pretious chiefe. Sir Greg. I have been seeking for you i'th bowling Greene, Enquir'd at Nettletons, and Anthonies Ordinary, T'ha's vext me to the heart, looke, I've a Diamond here, And it cannot finde a Master. Cun. No? That's hard y'faith. Sir Greg. It does belong to some body, aâon him, I would he had it, do's but trouble me, And she that sent it, is so waspish too, There's no returning to her till't be gone. Cun. Oh, ho, ah sirrah, are you come? Sir Greg. What's that friend? Cun. Do you note that corner sparkle? Sir Greg. Which? which? which Sir? Cun. At the West end a'the Coller. Sir Greg. Oh I see't now. Cun. 'Tis an apparent marke; this is the stone, Sir, That so much blood is threatned to be shed for. Sir Greg. I pray? Cun. A tunne at least. Sir Greg. They must not find't I'me then, they must Go where 'tis to be had. Cun. 'Tis well it came to my hands first, Sir Gregory, I know where this must go. Sir Greg. Am I discharg'd on't? Cun. My life for yours now. Drawes. Sir Greg. What now? Cun. 'Tis discretion, Sir, Ile stand upon my Guard all the while I ha't. Sir Greg. 'Troth thou tak'st too much danger on thee still, To preserve me alive. Cun. 'Tis a friends duty, Sir, Nay, by a toy that I have late thought upon, Ile undertake to get your Mistris for you. Sir Greg. Thou wilt not? wilt? Cun. Contract her by a trick, Sir, When she least thinks on't. Sir Greg. There's the right way to't, For if she thinke on't once, shee'l never do't. Cun. She doe's abuse you still then? Sir Greg. Aâdamnably, Every time worse then other; yet her Uncle Thinks the day holds a tuesday; say it did, Sir, She's so familiarly us'd to call me rascall, She'l quite forget to wed me by my owne name, And then that marriage cannot hold in Law, you know. Cun. Will you leave all to me? Sir Greg. Who should I leave it to? Cun. 'Tis our luck to love Neeces; I love a Neece too. Sir Greg. I would you did y'faith. Cun. But mine's a kinde wretch. Sir Greg. I marry Sir, I would mine were so too. Cun. No rascall comes in her mouth. Sir Greg. Troth, and mine has little else in hers. Cun. Mine sends me tokens, All the world knows not on. Sir Greg. Mine gives me tokens too, very fine tokens, But I dare not weare 'em. Cun. Mine's kinde in secret. Sir Greg. And there's mine's a hell-cat. Cun. We have a day set too. Sir Greg. 'Slid, so have we man, But there's no signe of ever comming together. Cun. Tell thee who 'tis, the old womans Neece. Sir Greg. Is't she? Cun. I would your luck had been no worse for mildnesse; But mum, no more words on't to your Lady. Sir Greg. Foh! Cun. No blabbing as you love me. Sir Greg. None of our blood Were ever bablers. Cun. Prethee convey this Letter to her, But at any hand let not your Mistris see't. Sir Greg. Yet agen Sir? Cun. There's a Jewell in't, The very art would make her doat upon't. Sir Greg. Say you so? And she shall see't for that trick onely. Cun. Remember but your Mistris, and all's well. Sir Greg. Nay if I do not hang me. Exit. Cun. I believe you; This is the onely way to returne a token, I know he will do't now, cause he's charg'd to'th contrary. He's the nearest kin to a woman, of a thing Made without substance, that a man can finde agen, Some petticoat begot him, Ile be whipt else, Engendring with an old paire of pawnde hose, Lying in some hot chamber o're the Kitchin, Very steame bred him, He never came where Rem in Re e're grew; The generation of a hundred such Cannot make a man stand in a white sheet, For 'tis no act in Law, nor can a Constable Pick out a bawdy businesse for Bridewell in't; Enter Clowne (as a Gallant.) A lamentable case, he's got with a mans Urine, like a Mandrake. How now? hah? what prodigious bravery's this? A most preposterous Gallant, the Doublet sits As if it mockt the breeches. Clow. Save you, Sir, Cun. Has put his tongue in the fine suit of words too. Clow. How doe's the party? Cun. Takes me for a Scrivener. Which of the parties? Clow. Hum, simplicity betide theeâ I would faine heare of the party; I would be loath to go Further with her; honour is not a thing to be dallied withall, No more is reputation, no nor fame, I take it, I must not Have her wrong'd when I'me abroad, my party is not To be compell'd with any party in an oblique way; 'Tis very dangerous to deale with women; May prove a Lady too, but shall be namelesse, Ile bite my tongue out, e're it prove a Traitor. Cun. Upon my life I know her. Clow. Not by me, Know what you can, talke a whole day with me, Y'are ne're the wiser, she comes not from these lips. Cun. The old Knights Neece. Clow. 'Slid he has got her, pox of his heart that told him, Can nothing be kept secret? let me entreat you To use her name as little as you can, though. Cun. 'Twill be small pleasure, Sir, to use her name. Clow. I had intelligence in my solemne walks, 'Twixt Paddington and Pancridge, of a Scarfe, Sent for a token, and a Jewell follow'd, But I acknowledge not the receipt of any, How e're 'tis carried, believe me Sir, Upon my reputation I received none. Cun. What, neither Scarfe nor Jewell? Clow. 'Twould be seene Some where about me, you may well think that, I have an arme for a Scarfe, as others have, And dare to hang a Jewell too, and that's more Then some men have, my betters a great deale, I must have restitution, where e're it lights. Cun. And reason good. Clow. For all these tokens, Sir, Passe i' my name. Cun. It cannot otherwise be. Clow. Sent to a worthy friend. Cun. I, that's to thee. Clow. I'me wrong'd under that title. Cun. I dare sweare thou art, 'Tis nothing but Sir Gregories circumvention, His envious spite, when thou'rt at Paddington, He meets the gifts at Pancridge. Clow. Ah false Knight? False both to honour, and the Law of Arms? Cun. What wilt thou say if I be reveng'd for thee? Thou sit as witnesse? Clow. I should laugh in state then. Cun. Ile fobb him, here's my hand. Clow. I should be as glad as any man alive, to see him well fob'd, Sir; but now you talk of fobbing, I wonder the Lady sends not for me according to promise? I ha' kept out a Towne these two daies, a purpose to be sent for; I am almost starv'd with walking. Cun. Walking gets men a stomack. Clow. 'Tis most true, Sir, I may speake it by experience, for I ha' got a stomack six times, and lost it agen, as often as a traveller from Chelsy shall lose the sight of Pauls, and get it agen. Cun. Go to her, man. Clow. Not for a Million, enfringe my oath? there's a toy call'd a vowe, has past betweene us, a poore trifle, Sir; Pray do me the part and office of a Gentleman, if you chance to meet a Footman by the way, in orange tawny ribbands, running before an empty Coach, with a Buzzard i'th Poope on't, direct him and his horses toward the new River by Islington, there they shall have me looking upon the Pipes, and whistling. Exit Clow. Cun. A very good note; this love makes us all Monkeyes, But to my work: Scarfe first? and now a Diamond? these Should be sure signes of her affections truth; Yet Ile go forward with my surer proofe. Exit. Enter Neece, and Sir Gregory. Sir Greg. Is't possible? Nay here's his Letter too, there's a fine Jewell in't, Therefore I brought it to you. Neece. You tedious Mongrill! Is't not enough To grace thee, to receive this from thy hand; A thing which makes me almost sick to do, But you must talke too? Sir Greg. I ha' done. Neece. Fall back, Yet backer, backer yet, you unmannerly puppy, Do you not see I'me going about to reade it? Sir Greg. Nay these are golden daies, now I stay by't, She was wont not to endure me in her sight at all, The world mends, I see that. Neece. What an ambiguous Superscription's here? To the best of Neeces. Why that title may be mine, And more then her's: Sure I much wrong the neatnesse of his art; 'Tis certaine sent to me, and to requite My cunning in the carriage of my Tokens, Us'd the same Fop for his. Sir Greg. She nodded now to me, 'twill come in time. Neece. What's here? an entire Rubye, cut into a heart, And this the word, Istud Amoris opus? Sir Greg. Yes, yes, I have heard him say that love is the best stone-cutter. Neece. Why thou sawcy issue of some travelling Sowgelder, What makes love? thy mouth? is it a thing That ever will concerne thee? I do wonder How thou dar'st think ont? hast thou ever hope To come i' the same roome where lovers are; And scape unbrain'd with one of their velvet slippers? Sir Greg. Love tricks breake out I see, and you talk of slippers once, 'Tis not farre off to bed time. Neece. Is it possible thou canst laugh yet? I would ha' undertooke to ha' kill'd a spider With lesse venome far, then I have spit at thee. Sir Greg. You must conceive, A Knight's another manner a peece of flesh. Neece. Back, Owles face. Within O. K. Do, do. Neece. 'Tis my Uncles voyce, that: Why keep you so farre off, Sir Gregory? Are you afraid, Sir, to come neare your Mistris? Sir Greg. Is the proud heart come downe? I lookt for this still. Nee. He comes not this way yet: Away, you dog-whelp, Would you offer to come neare me, though I said so? Ile make you understand my minde in time; Your running greedily like a hound to his breakfast, That chops in head and all to beguile his fellowes; I'me to be eaten, Sir, with Grace and leisure, Behaviour and discourse, things that ne're trouble you; After I have pelted you sufficiently, I tro you will learne more manners. Sir Greg. I'me wondring still when we two shall come together? Tuesday's at hand, but I'me as farre off, as I was at first, I sweare. Enter Gardianesse. Gard. Now Cuningame, Ile be reveng'd at large: Lady, what was but all this while suspition, Is truth, full blowne now, my Neece weares your Scarfe. Neece. Hah? Gard. Do but follow me, Ile place you instantly Where you shall see her courted by Cuningame. Neece. I go with greedinesse; we long for things That break our hearts sometimes, there's pleasures misery, (Exeunt Neece and Gard. Sir Greg. Where are those gad-flies going? to some Junket now; That some old humble-bee toles the yo?g one forth To sweet meats after kinde, let 'em looke to't, The thing you wot on, be not mist or gone, I bring a Maiden-head, and I looke for one. Exit. Enter Cunningame (in discourse with a Mask't Gentlewoman in abroad hat and scarf'd,) Neece at another doore. Cun. Yes, yes. Neece. Too manifest now, the Scarfe and all. Cun. It cannot be, you're such a fearefull soule. Neece. Ile give her cause of feare e're I part from her. Cun. Will you say so? Is't not your Aunts desire too? Neece. What a dissembling groane's that? shee'l forswear't now. Cun. I see my project takes, yonder's the grace on't. Neece. Who would put confidence in wit againe, I'me plagu'd for my ambition, to desire A wise man for a husband, and I see Fate will not have us go beyond our stint, We are allow'd but one dish, and that's Woodcock, It keeps up wit to make us friends and servants of, And thinks any thing's good enough to make us husbands Oh that whores hat a' thine, a' the riding block, A shade for lecherous kisses. Cun. Make you doubt on't? Is not my love of force? Neece. Yes, me it forces To teare that forcerous strumpet from th'Imbraces. Cun. Lady? Neece. Oh thou hast wrong'd the exquisit'st loveâ Cun. What meane you Lady? Neece. Mine, you'l answer for't. Cun. Alas, what seek you? Neece. Sir, mine owne with losse. Cun. You shall. Neece. I never made so hard a bargaine. Cun. Sweet Lady? Neece. Unjust man, let my wrath reach her, As you owe vertue duty; your cause trips you, Now Minion, you shall feele what loves rage is, Before you taste the pleasure; smile you false, Sir? Cun. How can I chuse? to see what paines you take, Upon a thing will never thank you for't? Neece. How? Cun. See what things you women be, Lady, When cloathes are taken for the best part of you? This was to show you, when you think I love you not, How y'are deceiv'd still, there the Morall lyes, 'Twas a trap set to catch you, and the only bait To take a Lady nibling, is fine clothes; Now I dare boldly thank you for your love, I'me pretty well resolv'd in't by this fit, For a jealous ague alwaies ushers it. Neece. Now blessings still maintaine this wit of thine, And I'me an excellent fortune comming in thee, Bring nothing else I charge thee. Cun. Not a groat I warrant ye. Neece. Thou shalt be worthily welcome, take my faith for't, Next opportunity shall make us. Cun. The old Gentlewoman has fool'd her revenge sweetly. Neece. Lasse 'tis her part, she knowes her place so well yonder; Alwaies when women jumpe upon three score, Love shoves 'em from the chamber to the doore. Cun. Thou art a precious she-wit. Exeunt.</field>

Friend, met in the harvest of our designes, Not a thought but's busle. Wit. I knew it man, And that made me provide these needfull Reapers, Hooks, Rakers, Gleaners; wee'l sing it home With a melodious Horne-pipe; this is the Bond, That as we further in your great affaire, You'l suffer us to gleane, pick up for crums, And if we snatch a handfull from the sheafe, You will not looke a churle on's.

There's one staies to speake with you Sir. Cun. What is he? 1 Serv. Faith I know not what, Sir, a foole I thinke, That some Brokers shop has made half a Gentleman; Has the name of a Worthy too. Cun. Pompey? is't not? 1 Serv. That's he, Sir. Cun. Alas poore fellow, prethee enter him, he will need too, Enter second Servant with a Gowne. He shall serve for a Witnesse. Oh Gramercy: If my friend Sir Gregory comes, you know him, Enter Clowne. Entertaine him kindly. Oh Master Pompey, how is't man? Clow. 'Snailes, I'me almost starv'd with love, and cold, and one thing or other; Has not my Lady sent for me yet? Cun. Not that I heare, sure some unfriendly Messenger Is imployed betwixt you, Clow. I was ne're so cold in my life, in my conscience I have been seven mile in length, along the new River; I have seene a hundred stickle bags; I do not thinke but there's gudgeons too; 'twill ne're be a true water. Cun. Why thinke you so? Clow. I warrant you, I told a thousand Millers thumbs in it, Ile make a little bold with your Sweet-meats. And welcome Pompey. Clow. 'Tis a strange thing, I have no taste in any thing. Cun. Oh, that's Love, that distaits any thing but it selfe. Clow. 'Tis worse then Cheese in that point, may not a man breake his word with a Lady? I could finde in my heart and my hose too. Cun. By no meanes Sir, that breakes all the Lawes of Love. Clow. Well, ile ne're passe my word without my deed to Lady, while I live agen, I would faine recover my taste. Cun. Well, I have newes to tell you. Clow. Good newes, Sir? Cun. Happy newes, I help you away with a Rivall your Master bestow'd Clow. Where for this plumbs sakeâ Cun. Nay listen me. Clow. I warrant you, Sir, I have two eares to one mouth, I heare more then I eat, i'de ne're row by Queen Hive While lived else. Cun. I have a wife for him, and that shall witnesse the Contract. Clow. The old one I hope, 'tis not the Lady? Cun. Choak him first, 'tis one which thou shalt see, See him, see him deceiv'd, see the deceit, only The injunction is, you shall smile with modesty. Clow. Ile simper ifaith, as cold as I am yet, the old one I hope. Enter Servant. Serv. Sir, here's Sir Gregory. Cun. Ud' so, shelter, shelter, if you be seene All's ravell'd out agen; stand there private, And you'le finde the very opportunity To call you forth, and place you at the Table. Enter Sir Gregory. You are welcome Sir, this Banquet will serve, When it is crown'd with such a dainty as you Expect, and must have. Sir Greg. Tush, these sweet-meats are but sauce to that, Well, if there be any honesty or true word in a dreame, She's mine owne, nay, and chang'd extreamely, Not the same woman. Cun. Who? not the Lady? Sir Greg. No, not to me, the edge of her tongue is taken off, Gives me very good words, turn'd upside downe to me, And we live as quietly as two Tortusses, if she hold on As she began in my dreame. Soft Musick. Cun. Nay, if Love send forth such Predictions, You are bound to beleeve 'em, there's the watch-word Of her coming, to your practis'd part now, If you hit it, Ãquus Cupido nobis. Both go into the Gowne Sir Greg. I will warrant you Sir, I will give armes to Your Gentry, looke you forward to your businesse, I am an eye behind you, place her in that Chaire, And let me alone to grope her out. Enter Mirabell. Cun. Silence, Lady, your sweet presence illustrates This homely roofe, and as course entertainment; But where affections are both Host and Guest, They cannot meet unkindly; please you fit, Your something long stay made me unmannerly, To place before you, you know this friend here, He's my Guest, and more especially, That this our meeting might not be too single, Without a witnesse to't. Mirab. I came not unresolv'd, Sir, And when our hands are clasp'd in that firme faith Which I expect from you; fame shall be bold To speake the lowdest on't: oh, you graspe me. Somewhat too hard friend. Cun. That's Loves eager will, Ile touch it gentlier. Kisse her hand. Mirab. That's too low in you, Lesse it be doubly recompenc'd in me. She kisses his hand. Clow. Puh, I must stop my mouth, I shall be choakt else. Cun. Come, wee'le not play and trifle with delayes, We met to joyne these hands, and willingly I cannot leave it till confirmation. Mirab. One word first, how does your friend, kinde Sir Gregory? Cun. Why do you mention him? you love him not? Mir. I shall love you the lesse if you say so, Sir, In troth I love him, but 'tis you deceive him, This flattering hand of yours does rob him now, Now you steale his right from him, and I know I shall have hate for't, his hate extreamly. Cun. Why I thought you had not come so weakly arm'd, Upon my life the Knight will love you for't, Exceedingly love you, for ever love you. Mir. I, you'le perswade me so. Cun. Why he's my friend, And wishes me a fortune equall with him, I know, and dare speake it for him. Mir. Oh, this hand betrayes him, you might remember him in some courtesie yet at least. Cun. I thank your help in't, here's to his health Where e're he be. Mir. Ile pledge it were it against my health. Clow. Oh, oh, my heart hops after twelve mile a day, upon a good returne, now could I walke three hundred mile a foot; and laugh forwards and backwards. Mir. You'le take the Knights health Sir, Clow. Yes, yes forsooth, oh my sides! such a Banquet once a weeke, would make me grow fat in a fortnight. Cun. Well, now to close our meeting, with the close Of mutuall hands and hearts, thus I begin, Here in Heaven's eye, and all loves sacred powers, (Which in my prayers stand propitious) I knit this holy hand fast, and with this hand The heart that owes this hand, ever binding By force of this initiating Contract Both heart and hand in love, faith, loyalty, Estate, or what to them belongs, in all the dues; Rights and honours of a faithfull husband, And this firme vow henceforth till death to stand Irrevocable, seal'd both with heart and hand. Mir. Which thus I second, but oh, Sir Gregory. Cun. Agen? this interposition's ill, beleeve me. Mir. Here in Heavens eye, and all Loves sacred powers I knit this holy hand fast, and with this hand The heart that owes this hand, ever binding Both heart and hand in love, honour, loyalty, Estate, or what to them belongs in all the dues, Rights, and duties of a true faithfull wife; And this firme Vow henceforth till death to stand, Irrevocable seal'd both with heart and hand. Sir Greg. A full agreement on both parts. Cun. I, here's witnesse of that. Sir Greg. Nay, I have over-reacht you Lady, and that's much, For any Knight in England to over-reach a Lady. Mir. I rejoyce in my deceit, I am a Lady Now, I thanke you Sir. Clow. Good morrow Lady Fop. Sir Greg. 'Snailes, i'me gull'd, made a worshipfull asse, this is not my Lady. Cun. But it is Sir, and true as your dreame told you, That your Lady was become another woman. Sir Greg. Ile have another Lady Sir, if there were no more Ladies in London, blinde-man buffe is an unlawfull Game. Cun. Come, downe on your knees first, and thanke your stars. Sir Greg. A fire of my stars, I may thanke you I think. Cun. So you may pray for me, and honour me, That have preserv'd you from a lasting torment, For a perpetuall comfort; did you call me friend? Sir Greg. I pray pardon me for that, I did miscall you, I confesse. Cun. And should I receiving such a thankfull name Abuse it in the act? should I see my friend Bafful'd, disgrac'd, without any reverence To your title to be call'd slave, rascall? Nay curst to your face, fool'd, scorn'd, beaten downe With a womans peevish hate, yet I should stand And suffer you to be lost, cast away? I would have seene you buried quick first, Your spurrs of Knight-hood to have wanted rowels, And to be kickt from your heeles; slave, rascall? Heare this tongue? Mir. My dearest Love, sweet Knight, my Lord, my Husband. Cun. So, this is not slave and rascall then. Mir. What shall your eye command, but shall be done, In all the duties of a loyall wife? Cun. Good, good, are not curses fitter for you? wer't not better Your head were broke with the handle of a fanne, Or your nose bor'd with a silver bodkin? Mir. Why, I will be a servant in your Lady. Cun. Pox, but you shall not, she's too good for you, This contract shall be a nullity, ile breake't off, And see you better bestow'd. Sir Greg. 'Slid, but you shall not Sir, she's mine owne, And I am hers, and we are one anothers lawfully, and let me see him that will take her away by the Civill Law, if you be my friend keepe you so, if you have done me a good turne, do not hit me ith' teeth with't, that's not the part of a friend. Cun. If you be contentâ Sir Greg. Content? I was never in better contention in my life, Ile not change her for both the Exchanges, New or the Old; Come, kisse me boldly. Clow. Give you joy, Sir. Sir Greg. Oh Sir, I thanke you as much as though I did, you are beloved of Ladies, you see we are glad of under women. Clow. Ladies? let not Ladies be disgrac'd, you are as it were a married man, and have a Family, and for the parties sake that was unnam'd before, being Pese-cod time, I am appeas'd, yet I would wish you make a ruler of your tongue. Cun. Nay, no dissention here, I must bar that, And this (friend) I entreat you, and be advis'd, Let this private contract be yet conceal'd, And still support a seeming face of love Unto the Lady; marke how it availes you, And quits all her scornes, her Unckle is now hot In pursuit of the match, and will enforce her Bend her proud stomack, that she shall proffer Her selfe to you, which when you have flouted, And laught your fill at, you shall scorne her off With all your disgraces trebled upon her, For there the pride of all her heart will bow, When you shall foot her from you, not she you. Sir Greg. Good ifaith; ile continue it, i'de faine laugh at the old fellow too, for he has abus'd me as scurvily as his Neece, my Knight-hood's upon the spur, wee'le go to Bed, and then to Church as fast as we can. Exit Sir Greg. and Mirab. Clow. I do wonder I do not heare of the Lady yet. Cun. The good minute may come sooner then you are aware of, I do not thinke but 'twill e're night yet as neare as 'tis. Clow. Well, I will go walke by the new River in that meditation, I am o're shooes i'me sure upon the dry bank, this gullery of my Master will keepe me company this two houres too, if love were not an enemy to laughter I should drive away the time well enough; you know my walke Sir, if she sends, I shall be found angling, for I will try what I can catch for luck sake, I will fish faire for't. Oh Knight that thou should'st be gull'd so; ha, ha, it does me good at heart, But oh Lady, thou tak'st downe my merry part. Exit. Enter Witty-pate. Witty. Friend. Cun. Here friend. Witty. All's a foot, and will go smooth away, The woman has conquer'd the women, they are gone, Which I have already complain'd to my Father, Suggesting that Sir Gregory is falne off From his charge, for neglects and ill usage, And that he is most violently bent On Gentries wife (whom I have call'd a widow) And that without most sudden prevention He will be married to her. Cun. Foot, all this is wrong, This wings his pursuit, and will be before me; I am lost for ever. Witty. No, stay, you shall not go But with my Father, on my wit let it lye, You shall appeare a friendly assistant, To helpe in all affaires, and in execution Helpe your selfe only. Cun. Would my beleefe Were stronge in this assurance. Witty. You shall credit it, And my wit shall be your slave if it deceive you. Enter Old Knight. My Fatherâ O. K. Oh Sir, you are well met, where's the Knight your friend? Cun. Sir, I thinke your Sonne has told you. Witty. Shall I stand to tell't agen? I tell you he loves, But not my Kins-woman, her base usage, And your slack performance which he accuses most Indeed, has turn'd the Knights heart upside downe. O. K. Ile curbe her for't, can he be but recover'd, He shall have her, and she shall be dutifull, And loue him as a wife too. Witty. With that condition Sir, I dare recall him were he enter'd the Church, So much interest of love I assure in him. O. K. Sir, it shall be no losse to you if you do. Witty. I, but these are words still, will not the deeds Be wanting at the recovery, if it should be agen? O. K. Why here foole, I am provided, five hunder'd in earnest, Of the thousands in her Dower, but were they married once, I'de cut him short enough, that's my agreement. Witty. I, now I perceive some purpose in you, Father. O. K. But wherefore is she then stolne out of doores to him? Witty. To him? oh fye upon your errour, she has another object, beleeve it Sir. O. K. I never could perceive it. Witty. I did Sir, and to her shame I should speake it, To my owne sorrow I saw it, dalliance, Nay dotage with a very Clowne, a Foole. O. K. Wit and wantons? nothing else? nothing else? She love a Foole? she'le sooner make a foole Of a wise man. Cun. I, my friend complaines so, Sir Gregory sayes flatly she makes a foole of him, And these bold circumstances are approv'd; Favours have been sent by him, yet he ignorant Whither to carry 'em; they have been understood, And taken from him, certaine Sir, there is An unsuspected fellow lyes conceal'd, What, or where e're he is, these slight neglects Could not be of a Knight else. O. K. Well Sir, you have promis'd (if we recover him Unmarried) to salve all these old bruises? Cun. Ile do my best Sir. O. K. I shall thanke you, costly Sir, and kindly too. Witty. Will you talke away the time here Sir, and come behinde all your purposes? O. K. Away good Sir. Witty. Then stay a little good Sir, for my advise, Why Father are you broke? your wit begger'd, Or are you at your wits end? or out of Love with wit? no trick of wit to surprize Those designes, but with open Hue and Cry, For all the world to talke on? this is strange, You were not wont to slubber a project so. O. K. Can you helpe at a pinch now? shew your selfe My sonne; go too, I leave this to your wit, Because ile make a proofe on't. Witty. 'Tis thus then, I have had late intelligence, they are now Buxsome as Bachus Froes, revelling, dancing, Telling the Musicks numbers with their feet, Awaiting the meeting of premonisht friends, That's questionlesse, little dreading you, Now Sir, with a dexterous trick indeed, suddaine And sufficient were well, to enter on um As something like the abstract of a Masque; What though few persons? if best for our purpose That commends the project. O. K. This takes up time. Witty. Not at all, I can presently furnish With loose disguises that shall fit that Scene. O. K. Why what wants then? Witty. Nothing but charge of Musick, That must be paid you know. O. K. That shall be my charges, ile pay the Musick, What e're it cost. Witty. And that shall be all your charge, Now on, I like it, there will be wit in't Father. Exit O. K. and Witty. Cun. I will neither distrust his wit nor friendship, Yet if his master braine should be o're-throwne My resolution now shall seize mine owne. Exit Enter Neece, Lady Ruinous, Gardianesse, Ruinous, Priscian, (with instrumenes masqu't. L. Ruin. Nay, let's have Musick, let that sweet breath at least Give us her ayrie welcome, 'twill be the best I feare this ruin'd receptacle will yeeld, But that most freely. Neece. My welcome followes me, Else I am ill come hither, you assure me Still Mr. Cuningame will be here, and that it was His kinde entreaty that wisht me meet him. L. Ruin. Else let me be that shame unto my Sex, That all beleefe may fly um. Neece. Continue still The Knights name unto my Gardianesse, She expects no other. L. Ruin. He will, he will assure you Lady, Sir Gregory will be here, and suddainely This Musick fore-ran him, is't not so consorts? Ruin. Yes Lady, he staies on some device to bring along Such a labour he was busie in, some witty device. Nee. 'Twill be long e're he comes then, for wit's a great Labour to him. Gard. Well, well, you'le agree better one day. Nee. Scarce two I think. Gard. Such a mock-begger suit of clothes as led me Into the fooles paire of Dice, with dewze ace, He that would make me Mistris Cun, Cun, Cunnie, He's quite out of my minde, but I shall ne're Forget him while I have a hole in my head, Such a one I think would please you better, Though he did not abuse you. Ruin. Fye, speake well of him now, Your Neece has quitted him. Gard. I hope she has, Else she looses me for ever; but for Sir Gregory, Would he were come. I shall ill answer this Unto your Unckle else. Nei. You know 'tis his pleasure I should keepe him company. Gard. I, and should be your owne If you did well too, Lord, I do wonder At the nicenesse of you Ladies now a dayes, They must have Husbands with so much wit forsooth. Worship and wealth were both wont to be In better request i'me sure, I cannot tell, But they get ne're the wiser children that I see. L. Ruin. La, la, la, la, Sol, this Musick breathes in vaine, Me thinks 'tis dull to let it move alone, Let's have a female motion, 'tis in private, And wee'le grace't our selves how ever it deserves. Nee. What say you Gardianesse? Gard. 'Lasse i'me weary with the walke, My jaunting dayes are done. L. Ruin. Come, come, we'le fetch her in by course, or else She shall pay the Musick. Gard. Nay, ile have a little for my money then. The Dance, a Cornet is winded. L Ruin. Hark? upon my life the Knight; 'tis your friend, This was the warning-peece of his approach. Enter Old Knight, Witty-pate, Cuningame, Masqu'd, and take them to dance. L. Ruin. Ha? no words but mum? well then, We shall need no counsell-keeping Nee. Cuningame? Cun. Yes, feare nothing. Nee. Feare? why do you tell me of it? Cun. Your Unckles here. Nee. Aye me. Cun. Peace. O. K. We have caught 'em. Witty. Thanke my wit Father. Gard. Which is the Knight thinke you? Nee. I know not, he will be found when be speakes, No Maske can disguise his tongue. Witty. Are you charg'd? O. K. Are you awake? Witty. I'me answer'd in a question. Cun. Next change we meet, we loose our hands no more. Nee. Are you prepar'd to tye 'em? Cun. Yes, You must go with me. Gard. Whether Sir? not from my charge beleeve me. Cun. She goes a long. Nee. Will you ventur and my Unckle here? Cun. His stay's prepar'd for. Exeunt they two. Gard. 'Tis the Knight sure, ile follow. Exit Cun. Nee. Gardianesse. O. K. How now, the Musick tyr'd before us? Ruin. Yes Sir, we must be paid now. Witty. Oh, that's my charge Father. O. K. But stay, where are our wanton Ladies gone? Sonne, where are they? Witty. Onely chang'd the roome in a change, that's all sure. O. K. Ile make 'em all sure else, and then returne to you. Ruin. You must pay for your Musick first, Sir. O. K. Must? are there musty Fidlers? are Beggers choosers now? Ha? why Witty-pate, Sonne, where am I? Witty. You were dancing e'ne now, in good measure, Sir, Is your health miscarried since? what ayle you, Sir? O. K. Death, I may be gull'd to my face, where's my Neece? What are you? L. Ruin. None of your Neece, Sir. O. K. How now? have you loud Instruments too? ile heare No more I thanke you, what have I done tro To bring these feares about me? Sonne, where am I? VVitty. Not where you should be, Sir, you should be paying For your Musick, and you are in a maze. O. K. Oh, is't so, put up, put up, I pray you, Here's a crowne for you. L. Ruin. Pish, a crowne? Ru., Pris. Ha, ha, ha, a crowne? O. K. Which way do you laugh? I have seene a crowne Has made a Consort laugh heartily. VVitty. Father, To tell you truth, these are no ordinary Musitians, they expect a bounty Above their punctuall desert. O. K. Aâon your Puncks, and their deserts too. Am I not cheated all this while thinke you? Is not your pate in this? VVitty. If you be cheated, You are not to be Indicted for your owne goods, Here you trifle time to market your bounty And make it base, when it must needs be free For ought I can perceive. O. K. Will you know the lowest price, Sir? VVitty. That I will Sir, with all my heart. O. K. Unlesse I was discover'd, and they now fled Home agen for feare, I am absolutely beguil'd, That's the best can be hop'd for. Witty. Faith 'tis somewhat too deare yet, Gentlemen. Ruin. There's not a Denier to be bated, Sir. O. K. Now Sir, how deare is it? VVitty. Bate but the tother ten pound? Pris. Not a Bawbee, Sir. O. R. How? bate ten pound? what's the whole summe then? Witty. Faith Sir, a hundred pound, with much a doe, I got fifty bated, and faith Father, to say truth, 'Tis reasonable for men of their fashion. O. K. La, la, la, downe, a hunder'd pound? la, la, la, You are a Consort of Theeves, are you not? Witty. No Musitians Sir, I told you before. O. K. Fiddle faddle, is it not a robbery? a plaine robbery? Witty. No, no, no, by no meanes Father, you have receiv'd For your money, nay, and that you cannot give back, 'Tis somewhat deare I confesse, but who can helpe it? If they had been agreed with before hand, 'Twas ill forgotten. O. K. And how many shares have you in this? I see my force, Case up your Instruments, I yield, here, as rob'd and Taken from me, I deliver it. VVitty. No Sir, you have perform'd your promise now, which was, to pay the charge of Musick, that's all. O. K. I have heard no Musick, I have receiv'd none, Sir, There's none to be found in me, nor about me. VVitty. Why Sir, here's witnesse against you, you have danc'd, And he that dances acknowledges a receit Of Musick. O. K. I deny that Sir, looke you, I can dance without Musick, do you see Sir? and I can sing without it too; you are a consort of Theeves, do you heare what I do? Witty. Pray you take heed Sir, if you do move the Musick agen, it may cost you as much more. O. K. Hold, hold, ile depart quietly, I need not bid you farewell, I think now, so long as that hundred pound lasts with you. Enter Gardianesse. Gard. Ha, ha, am I snapt ifaith? Oh, Sir, Perfidious. O. K. I, I, some howling anotherwhile, Musick's too damnable deare. Gard. Oh Sir, my heart-strings are broke, if I can but live to tell you the tale I care not, your Neece my charge isâ O. K. What, is she sick? Gard, No, no Sir, she's lustily well married. O. K. To whom? Gard. Oh, to that cunning dissembler, Cuningame. O. K. Ile hang the Priest, first, what was he? Gard. Your Kinsman Sir, that has the Welch Benefice. O. K. I sav'd him from the Gallowes to that end, good, is there any more? Garde. And Sir Gregory is married too. O. K. To my Neece too, I hope, and then I may hang her. Gard. No Sir, to my Neece, thank Cupid; and that's all that's likely to recover me, she's Lady Fop now, and I am One of her Aunts I thanke my promotion. Enter Credulous, Cuningame, Neece, Sir Gregory, and Mirabell. Cred. I have perform'd your behest Sir. O. K. What have you perform'd Sir? Witty. Faith Sir, I must excuse my Cousen in this act, If you can excuse your selfe for making him A Priest, there's the most difficult answer I put this practise on him as from your desire, A truth, a truth Father. Cred. I protest Sir, he tells you truth, he mov'd me to't in your name. O. K. I protest Sir, he told you a lye in my name, and were you so easie Mr. Credulous to beleeve him? Cred. If a man should not beleeve his Cousen Sir, whom should he beleeve? O. K. Godden to you good Mr. Cousen Cuningame, And your faire Bride, my Cousen Cuningame too, And how do you, Sir Gregory, with your faire Lady? Sir Greg. A little better then you would have had me, I thanke you Sir, the dayes of Puppy, and Slave, and Rascall are pretty well blowne over now, I know Crabs from Verjuyce, I have tryed both, and thoud'st give me thy Neece for nothing i'de not have her. Cun. I thinke so Sir Gregory, for my sake you would not. Sir Greg. I wo'd thou had'st scap'd her too, and then she had dyed of the greene sicknesse, know this, that I did marry in spight, and I will kisse my Lady in spight, and love her in spight, and beget children of her in spight, and when I dye they shall have my Lands in spight; this was my resolution, and now 'tis out. Neece. How spightfull are you now, Sir Gregory? Why looke you, I can love my dearest Husband, With all the honours, duties, sweet embraces, That can be throwne upon a loving man. Sir Greg. âThis is afore your Unckles face, but behinde his back in private you'le shew him another tale. Cun. You see Sir, now the irrecoverable state of all these things before you, come out of your muse, they have been but wit weapons, they were wont to love the play. Enter Clowne. O. K. Let me alone in my muse a little Sir, I will wake to you anon. Cun. U'd so, your friend Pompey, how will you answer him? Neece. Very well, if you'le but second it, and help me. Clow. I do heare strange stories, are Ladies things obnoxious? Neece. Oh, the dissembling falsest wretch is come. Cun. How now Lady? Neece. Let me come to him, and in stead of love Let me have revenge. Witty. Pray you now, will you first examine, whither he be guilty or no. Neece. He cannot be excus'd, How many Messengers (thou perjur'd man) Hast thou return'd with Vowes and Oathes? that thou Wouldst follow, and never till this unhappy houre Could I set eye of thee, since thy false dye Drew my heart to it? oh I could teare thee now, Instead of soft embraces, pray give me leaveâ Witty. Faith this was ill done of you Sir, if you promis'd otherwise. Clow. By this hand, never any Messenger came at me since the first time I came into her company; that a man should be wrong'd thus? Neece. Did not I send thee Scarfes and Diamonds? And thou returnd'st me letters, one with a false heart in't. Witty. Oh fye! to receive favours, returne false-hoods, and hold a Lady in handâ Clow. Will you believe me Sir? if ever I receiv'd Diamonds, or Scarfe, or sent any Letter to her, would this Sword might ne're go through me. Witty. Some bad Messengers have gone betweene you then. Neece. Take him from my sight, if I shall see to morrow. Witty. Pray you forbeare the place, this discontent may impaire her health much. Clow. Foot, if a man had been in any fault 'twould ne're have griev'd him, Sir, if you'le beleeve. Witty. Nay, nay, protest no more, I do believe you, But you see how the Lady is wrong'd by't; She has cast away her selfe it is to be fear'd, Against her Unckles will, nay, any consent, But out of a meere neglect, and spight to herselfe, Married suddenly without any advice. Clow. Why who can helpe it? if she be cast away she may thanke her selfe, she might have gone further and far'd worse; I could do no more then I could do, 'twas her owne pleasure to command me that I should not come till I was sent for, I had been with her every minute of an houre else. Witty. Truly I believe you. Clow. Night and day she might have commanded me, and that she knew well enough; I said as much to her between her and I, yet I protest she's as honest a Lady for my part, that i'de say if she would see me hang'd, if she be cast away I cannot helpe it, she might have stay'd to have spoke with a man. Witty. Well, 'twas a hard misse on both parts. Clow. So 'twas, I was within one of her, for all this crosse luck, I was sure I was between the Knight and home. Neece. Not gone yet? oh my heart! none regard my health? Witty. Good Sir, forbeare her sight a while, you heare how ill she brookes it. Clow. Foolish woman, to over-throw her fortunes so; I shall thinke the worse of a Ladies wit while I live for'tâ I could almost cry for anger, if she should miscarry now, 'twould touch my conscience a little, and who knowes what love and conceit may do? what would people say as I go along? there goes he that the Lady dyed for love on, I am sure to heare on't ith' streets, I shall weepe before hand; foolish woman, I do grieve more for thee now then I did love thee before; well, go thy waies, would'st thou spare thy Husbands head and breake thine owne heart? if thou hadst any wit, I would some other had been the cause of thy undoing, I shall be twitted i'th teeth with't, i'me sure of that, foolish Lady. Exit. Neece. So, so, this trouble's well shooke off, Unckle, how dee? there's a Dowrie due, sir. Cun. We have agreed it, sweetest, And finde your Unckle fully recover'd, kinde to both of us. Witty. To all the rest I hope; O. K. Never to thee, nor thee, easie cousen Credulous, Was your wit so raw? Cred. Faith yours Sir, so long season'd Has been faulty too, and very much to blame, Speaking it with reverence, Unckle. Sir Greg. Yes faith, Sir, you have paid as deare for your time as any man here. Witty. I Sir, and ile reckon it to him. Imprimis, The first preface cheat of a paire of peeces to the Beggers, you remember that I was the example to your bounty there, I spake Greeke, and Syriacke, Sir, you understand me now. Next, the Robbery put upon your indulgent Cousen, which indeed was no Robbery, no Constable, no Justice, no Thiefe, but all Cheaters; there was a hunder'd Mark, mark you that. Lastly, this memorable 100. pounds worth of Musick, this was but cheats and wit too, and for the assistance, this Gentleman to my Cousen (for which I am to have a Fee) that was a little practice of my wit too, Father; will you come to composition yet, Father? Cun. Yes faith Sir, do, two hunder'd a yeare will be easier then so much weekly, I do not think he's barren if he should be put to't agen. O. K. Why this was the day I look'd for, thou shalt have't, And the next cheat makes it up three hunder'd; Live thou upon thy ten pound Vicarage, Thou get'st not a penny more, here's thy full Hire now. Cred. I thanke you Sir. Witty. Why there was the summe of all my wit Father, To shove him out of your favour, which I fear'd Would have dis-inherited me. O. K. Most certaine it had, Had not thy wit recover'd it; is there any here That had a hand with thee? Witty. Yes, all these Sir. O. K. Nephew, part a hunder'd pound amongst 'em, Ile repay it; wealth, love me as I love wit; When I dye, Ile build an Almes-house for decay'd wits. Sir Greg. Ile entertaine one in my life time; Schollar, you shall be my Chaplaine, I have the gift of twenty Benefices, simple as I am here. Pris. Thankes my great Patron. Cun. Sir, your Gentry and your name shall both be rais'd as high as my fortunes can reach 'em, for your friends sake. Witty. Something will be in my present power, the future more, You shall share with me. Ruin. and VVife. Thankes worthy Gentlemen. Neece. Sir, I would beg one thing of you? Sir Greg. You can beg nothing of me. Witty. Oh Sir, if she begs, there's your power over her. Sir Greg. She has begg'd me for a foole already, but 'tis no matter, I have begg'd her for a Lady that she might have been, That's one for another. Witty. Nay, but if she begâ Sir Greg. Let her beg agen then. Nee. That your man Pompeyes Coat may come over his eares backe agen, I would not he should be lost for my sake. Sir Greg. Well, 'tis granted, for mine owne sake. Mirab. Ile entreat it Sir. Sir Greg. Why then 'tis granted for your sake. O. K. Come, come, downe with all weapons now, 'tis Musicke time, So it be purchas'd at an easie rate; Some have receiv'd the knocks, some given the hits, And all concludes in love, there's happy wits.

      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue at the reviving of this Play. We need not tell you Gallants, that this night The VVits have jumpt, or that the Scenes hit right, 'Twould be but labour lost for to excuse VVhat Fletcher had to do in, his brisk Muse VVas so Mercuriall, that if he but writ An Act, or two, the whole Play rise up wit. Wee'le not appeale unto those Gentlemen Judge by their Clothes, if they sit right, nor when The Ladies smile, and with their Fannes delight To whiske a clinch aside, then all goes right: 'Twas well receiv'd before, and we dare say, You now are welcome to no vulgar Play. Here endeth Wit at severall Weapons.</field>
