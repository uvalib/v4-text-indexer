      <field name="fulltext">TROADES; OR THE Royal Captives. A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? Res Asiæ, Priamique evertere Gentem Immeritam, visum est superis. ? Virg. Æn. 3.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Troy yet in Flames, fresh Grief from old Grounds springs, Revenge not satisfy'd: fierce Phthia's Kings Offended Ghost Polyxena demands As his vow'd Bride, be slain by Pyrrhus Hands. Disputes 'bout this he with Atrides bands, Ended by Chalcas; who, Great Hector's Son Says must from Cæa's Tower be headlong thrown. So what is said, is done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter HECUBA. Who trust in Thrones, in proud Escurials reign, Nor fear the Easie Gods, possest with vain Credulity of a still prosperous State, Me let him look on, and thee Troy! By Fate A greater Document was never shown On what a slippery Hight Pride stands! O'erthrown Is Asia's strong Support, of God-like Hands Th'egregious Labour; under whose Commands He who cold seven-mouth'd Tanais drinks, once bore Confederate Arms; and he who does adore The Rising Sun, where Tigris warm Streams stain Their Waters in the Erithræan Main; And She, whose Realms the wandring Scythians bound, Who beats with widowed Troops the Pontick Ground. By Steel mow'd down, now her own Ruins Weight Bears Pergamus; her Tow'rs which glister'd late With their fir'd Buildings fallen: All, All's o'erturn'd In Flames; Assaracus his Palace burn'd. Nor Flames the Victors greedy Hands prevent, But while yet burning, Troy's for Pillage rent. Smoak in Waves rising takes Heaven's Sight away, And black-burnt Cinders smeer the Face of Day. Measuring with greedy Eye Troy's long sought Spoil The Victor stands, and now his Ten Years Toil Forgives; astonish'd at her Ruins, he yet Scarce thinks it vincible, though won he see it. The Dardan Wealth Greek Souldiers bear away; Nor can a thousand Ships contain the Prey. To witness here I call the adverse Pow'rs! And thou, once Ruler of the Phrygian Tow'rs, Beneath the Ruins of thy Empire laid My Countries Ashes! and thy Dearer Shade, Who standing, Ilium stood. Ye lesser Ghosts, My Childrens numerous Souls! What ever Cross Hath fall'n, what Ills th'inspired Maid foretold, (The God belief forbidding) those of Old, Saw pregnant Hecuba; nor held my Peace, Before Cassandra, a vain Prophetess. Not crafty Ithacus, nor Diomed, Nor treacherous Sinon, through your Buildings spread These Flames; These Fires are mine; and with my Brands You burn. But why lamenting thus Troy's Ruins, stands Too long-liv'd Age? Here Wretch! look here, on these (Troy's an old Grief) more fresh Calamities. I saw (O cruel Fact!) the old King slain; And, a worse Crime, the sacred Altars stain Than armed Ajax dar'd. When with Hands wreath'd In's Hair, his Head reversing, Pyrrhus sheath'd In a deep Wound his cursed Blade; which strook Up to the Hilts; when the King willing took; Drawn forth his aged Throat, scarce reek'd with Blood. Whom not the sense of his extreme Age cou'd From so abhorr'd a Murder once restrain, Nor present Gods, nor yet Joves sacred Fane, The Glory once of this now levell'd State. He to so many Princes Father late, Now wants a Sepulcher, and Funeral Fire, His Troy in Flames. Nor can all this Heaven's Ire Appease. To Lords, lo! Priam's Daughters by The Urn are given, whom, a scorn'd Prize, shall I Attend? Some one may his Wife Hector's make, Some Helenus, some may Antenor's take: Perhaps some one thy Bed, Cassandra, seeks; I'm only a fear'd Lot to all the Greeks. Cease you my Captive Troops! Your Plaints forbear! Beat with your Hands your Breasts, with Cries the Air, And Troy's sad Obsequies perform: Now round Ide, that dire Judge's Fatal Seat, resound. CHORUS of Captive Trojan Ladies. No rude Crew un-inur'd to Tears Bid you to mourn: Successive Years Can witness, this w'have never ceast To do, since first the Phrygian Guest Amyclæ reach'd, and Cybel's Pine Did plow blew Neptune's foaming Brine. On to our Plaints, and as we weep, Do thou, O wretched Queen, Time keep With thy advanced Hand: whilst we, Skill'd in our Parts, do follow thee. Hecuba. You faithful Consorts of our Woe Unbind your Tresses: Let your Hair About your sad Necks loosely flow, Powder'd with Troy's warm Ashes: Bare Your Arms; your Vestures, slackly ty'd Beneath your naked Bosoms, slide Down to your Wasts. For whose Bed drest Vail'st thou, O Captive, Shame! thy Breast? A looser Zone your Garments bind! Your Cries with frequent Strokes be join'd! Hands prest t'assail! Aye, now you please, Thus habited! Now Troades I know you all: Again renew Your mournful Plaints, and strive t'outdo Th'Expressions common Sorrows vent, 'Tis Hector whom we now lament! CHORUS. Our Locks oft torn to wail the Dead, See! We have all unfilleted, And 'bout our shoulders loosly thrown; Upon our Heads warm Ashes strown. Hecuba. Fill then your Hands; From Troy this yet We lawfully may take; and let From your devested Shoulders slide, Your Garments, down on either side. Now bared Bosoms call for Blows. Now, Sorrow, all thy Pow'rs disclose. Rhætean Shores with Plaints resound, And Eccho the sad Cries rebound: Nor, as she's wont, ingeminate The last of Words, but iterate Troy's Plaints entire; that all the Main, And all the Heav'ns may ring again. Now let remorsless Hands infest With sounding strokes each suff'ring Breast; W' are not with usual Stripes content; 'Tis Hector whom we now lament, CHORUS. For thee our Arms we beat, and Blows On bleeding Shoulders thus impose. For thee our Heads these Strokes do bear, Our nursing Breasts for thee we tear. The Wounds which since thy Death remain Yet green, now freshly bleed again. Thy Country's strength! Fates Remora! The tired Phrygians only stay. Troy's Rampart! who upheld'st her Tow'rs Ten Years against assailing Pow'rs. With thee she fell; one Day a Grave To Hector and his Country gave. HECUBA. Turn now your Plaints; Let Priam too Be wept for: Hector hath his due. CHORUS. Receive our Tears, twice captiv'd King! Thee Reigning, Fates no Cross did bring Single on Troy; twice did she feel Herculean Shafts, twice Grecian Steel. When after all the Tragic Falls Of Hecub's Race; and Funerals Of Princely Sons; thy self, in fine, Did'st close their Tragedies with thine. And to great Jove, a Victim slain, Troy's Shores thy headless Trunk sustain. Hecuba. Your Tears on other Subjects spend, Ye Ilian Dames, my Priam's End Is not to be lamented. All Deceased Priam Happy call. He to th'infernal Shades went free, Not thrall'd in Grecian Slavery. He ne'er th'Atrides saw, he never The false Ulysses knew, nor ever Shall bow his captiv'd Neck, a Prize In their triumphed Victories. Nor shall his Hands, which late sustain'd A Scepter, be behind him chain'd, Nor in Gold Fetters manacled Following the Victor's Car, be led In pomp through proud Mycenæ. CHORUS. All Deceased Priam happy call; Attended at his latest Fate With the whole Ruine of his State. Who now in the Elizian Groves Delightful Shades securely roves, And 'mong the pious Ghosts makes Quest For Hector. Happy Priam! “Nor less blest “Whoever in War's bloody strife “Falling, sees all things perish with his Life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. TALTHIBIUS, and CHORUS of old Trojans. Talthibius. How long in Port the Greeks still wind-bound are! When War they seek, or for their Homes prepare! CHORUS. The Cause declare them and their Fleet detains, What God it is that their Return restrains. Talthibius. Amazement strikes my Soul; a trembling Cold Palsies my Joynts. Prodigious Truths when told Are hardly credited; yet these, these Eyes Were Witnesses: And now the Sun's uprise New gilt the Mountain tops, and Eastern Light Had clearly vanquish'd the whole Hoast of Night; When on a sudden the sore-shaken Ground, Breath'd from its Centre a strange bellowing Sound: Woods bow'd their Heads, the sacred Grove with loud Cracks rung, like Thunder breaking through a Cloud; Stones from cleft Ida's Quarries fell: Nor shook The Earth alone; the Sea with Terrour strook, Th'Approach of her Achilles felt, and laid Her swelling Waves. Th'Earth yawning then display'd Her immense Caves, and from the Depths of Night Open'd a Passage to Ætherial Light: The Tomb disburd'ning, whence the Ghost arose Of great Achilles; Such when Thracian Foes (The Prelude to thy Fates, Troy!) he o'erthrew, And the white hair'd Neptunian Cycnus slew. Or when in heat of Fight, with strenuous Force Through Troops he charg'd, and stopp'd the Rivers Course With slaughter'd Carcasses, while Xanthus Tide, Seeking a Passage through, did slowly glide. Or such when Victor trailing by the Heels Hector and Troy, born on triumphant Wheels. Then with this Voice of Anger fills the Coast: Go, go, ye lingring Greeks, and rob our Ghost Of its due Honours; weigh ingrateful! weigh Your Anchors, through our Seas to make your way. 'Twas not with Trifles Greece did satisfie Achilles Anger, nor a Price less high Shall she now pay. Polyxena be wed T'our Ashes; and her Blood let Pyrrhus shed. This said, he shrouds himself in Night, and sinks To Hell again: the Earth together shrinks, Closing her gaping Clefts; the quiet Main Becalmed lies; the Winds their Rage restrain, The smooth Seas move with gentle Murmurings, And Triton thence the Hymeneal sings. Scene II. PYRRHUS, AGAMEMNON. Pyrrhus. When home you thought to sail, full Fraught with Joy, Achilles fell; by whose sole Arm fell Troy. Whose all-o'er-mastering Valour soon repaid The loss of that Delay which Scyros made, And Lesbos, that divides th'Ægean Flood; For Troy's Fall doubtful still, he absent, stood. Should you now haste to satisfie his Will, Yet were it tardy Satisfaction still. Now every Chief his proper Share hath took; For less Reward can so much Virtue look? Merits he nothing? Who, when (charg'd to shun Wars Hazards) his Life's Course he might have run In peaceful Quiet beyond Nestor's Years; Yet slighting his Disguise and Mothers Fears, He himself Man, by assum'd Arms, confest. When Telephus with barbarous Pride represt Our Entrance into Mysia, his yet rude Hand in that Prince's Blood he first imbru'd. Who felt with what a force the same could wound, Yet in his Cure, that no less gentle found. Thebes and Eetion by his Arms pursu'd, Both fell; his State and he at once subdu'd. The small Lyrnessus Mountain-seated Tow'rs, He with like Slaughter level'd by his Pow'rs. Enobled by fair Briseis Captive made. He Chryse, cause of kingly Difference, laid In her own Ruins. Tenedos renown'd By Fame, and Cilla rich in fertile Ground To Phœbus sacred, whose fat Pastures fed Large Thracian Flocks, by him were vanquished. What? And those Lands through which Caycus flows; Whose Streams augment by Spring-dissolved Snows. These so great Slaughters, Nations mighty dread, Like Whirlwinds through so many Cities spread, Which might have been anothers closing Fame, Were but his Marches Actions; thus he came: And in so many glorious Conquests shar'd The Spoils of War, while lie for War prepar'd. Though we his other Merits should refrain; Were not this One sufficient? Hector slain! He Ilium conquer'd; 'twas but sack'd by you. Our Parents noble Praises we'll pursue, And his brave Acts, for which that Praise is due. Who knows not Hector, in his Fathers Sight; In's Unkles, Memnon, fell by him in Fight? Whose Death his Parents Cheeks with Sorrow pal'd, And morning's rosie Looks in Mourning veil'd. Himself abhor'd the fatal Precedent, And learn'd, that Sons of Gods were not exempt From Death. Penthesilea too, of all Our Fears the last, did by his Valour fall. A Virgin then might but his Due be thought, Though even from Argos or Mycenæ brought, Priz'd you his Merits justly: Can you move A Doubt yet, or refuse his Will t'approve? Think you 'tis Cruelty to Peleus Son To offer Priam's Daughter? When your own A Sacrifice to Helena was made? For what even Precedent allows, we plead. Agamemnon. “Not to curb Passion, childish Weakness is. “Others the Heat of Youth inflames: But this In Pyrrhus is Hereditary. We Have felt thy Father's Rage; and th'Injurie Of his high Threats have suffer'd heretofore. “The more thy Power, thy Patience should be more. Why with the Blood of a young Virgin slain, Seek'st thou so great a Leader's Ghost to stain? “'Tis fit this first we learn to know, what e'er “The Victor ought to do; the Vanquish'd bear. “No violent Dominions long endure: “'Tis Moderation makes a Throne stand sure. “When Fortune swells our State to an Excess, “'Tis Wisdom to restrain our Happiness: “The Turns of Chance, and too propitious Pow'rs “Still fearing; Conquest teaching, how few Hours “Can to Subversion bring the greatest State. Troy's Fall hath rais'd our Thoughts to too elate, Too stern a Pride; in the same place we stand From whence she fell. Once with too proud a Hand I must confess I bare my self, but what Might have rais'd others Thoughts, Success; e'en that Hath humbled Mine. Thou Priam, make me proud! Thou bid'st me fear. “What but a splendid Shroud “Of Vanity, may we think Crowns to be, “Our Brows impaling with false Majesty, “Which Chance, in one short Hour, may make her spoil, “Without a Thousand Ships, or Ten Years Toil. “So slow a Fate attends not all. And Greece! (If with thy leave I may confess it) This I'll say; I would have Ilium distrest, Nay more, subdu'd; her Ruin yet represt; But the hot Rage of an incensed Foe, And Victory, by Night obtained, know No Curb. What cruel or unworthy Fact May seem committed, that Revenge did act, And Darkness, which does Fury forward thrust, And the victorious Sword; whose killing Lust Having once tasted Blood 's ne'er satisfy'd. If ought of ruin'd Troy may yet abide After all this, now let it stand secur'd: Enough, more than enough, she hath endur'd. That at thy Father's Tomb the Princess shou'd Be made a Sacrifice, and with her Blood Sprinkle his Ashes, or that yet so vile Cruel a Murder we should Nuptials stile, We'll ne'er permit: 'Tis we must bear the blame: “Who ought, yet not forbids Ill, bids the same. Pyrrhus. Shall then Achilles Ghost due Honours want? Agamemnon. Dues it shall have, and every Tongue shall chant His Praise; and Lands unknown resound his Fame, And celebrate the Glory of his Name. If yet his Ashes nought but Blood can ease, Let that of slaughter'd Herds his Ghost appease. But let not Blood be spilt to be bewail'd, By wretched Mothers: How ye Gods prevail'd, Or whence did this inhumane Custom rise, Of making Man to Man a Sacrifice! Think but what Hate would to thy Sire accrue, Should such dire Rites be to his Honour due. Pyrrhus. Thou insolently haughty in Success, As fearfully dejected in Distress! Tyrant o'er Kings! Does new-sprung Love infest Yet once again with sudden Flames thy Breast? Does Agamemnon think that he shall still Thus wrong Achilles? No; know Pyrrhus will, Or see this Victim offer'd to his Grave, Or else a greater, worthier Victim have: This Sword here thinks it does too long abstain From Royal Blood, and Priam's Ghost would fain Have a King's bear it company. Agamemnon. 'Tis true; The greatest Praise that is to Pyrrhus due, Is that he murder'd Priam, whom his Sire Spar'd when his Suppliant. Pyrrhus. 'Tis Truth entire; We know't: that They who were my Father's Foes Were forc'd to be his Suppliant; you 'mongst those. But Priam was the stouter of the Two, He came in Person to petition; You Not yet so valiant as to supplicate, Like a tame Coward, chose to delegate Ajax and Ithacus to make your Prayer, Whilst you lay sculking, and kept close for fear. Agamemnon. But your brave Father fear'd not, 'tis confest, He 'mongst fir'd Ships, and slaughter'd Greeks could rest Secure; unmindful of his Charge; and run Upon his Lute nimble Division. Pyrrhus. Yet was great Hector, who your Arms despis'd, At sound but of his Lute with sear surpriz'd. And in the midst of Terrour and Dismay His Navy yet in peaceful Quiet lay. Agamemnon. Yes, the same Navy Priam durst to board. Pyrrhus. “'Tis kingly to a King Life to afford. Agamemnon. Then why a King did you deprive of Breath? Pyrrhus. “There's Mercy sometimes shewn in giving Death. Agamemnon. So you'd in Mercy sacrifice a Maid? Pyrrhus. And such a Sacrifice can you dissuade, Who offer'd your own Child? Agamemnon. “Their Kingdom's Good “Kings should prefer before their Childrens Blood. Pyrrhus. Forbid a Captive's Death no Law e'er did. Agamemnon. “What the Law does not, is by Shame forbid. Pyrrhus. “What likes, is lawful, by all Victors thought. Agamemnon. The more your Licence, to will less you ought. Pyrrhus. 'Fore these thus vant'st thou, who by Pyrrhus are Freed from the Bondage of a Ten Years War? Agamemnon. Breeds Scyrus such high Blood? Pyrrhus. Scyrus which knows No Brothers Sins. Agamemnon. Which strait'ning Seas inclose. Pyrrhus. Yes, Seas that owe us a relation; Indeed Thyestes noble House w' have known, Great Atreus too. Agamemnon. Out thou Girls Bastard Brat, Got by Achilles, when scarce Man. Pyrrhus. By that Achilles, who to the whole World ally'd Enjoys the Honours of the Deifi'd, Who can a Claim to Seas by Thetis move, To Hell by Æacus, to Heav'n by Jove. Agamemnon. Yes, he who fell by Paris feeble Hand. Pyrrhus. Whom yet not any of the Gods durst stand In open fight. Agamemnon. Sir, I could rule your Tongue, And give your Boldness due Correction; But that this Sword of ours knows how to spare E'en Captives: Let the Gods Interpreter, Calchas, be call'd, and what the Fates command By him, to that we willingly will stand. [Enter Calchas. Agamemnon. Thou Sacred Minister, who loos'dst the Bar Which stop'd the Grecian Navy, and the War; Whose Art unlocks the Heavens, expounds their Laws, And from Beasts Entrails, Thunder, Comets, draws The sure Presages of ensuing Fate; Whose Words we purchas'd at so dear a Rate, Now here declare what 'tis the Gods intend: And this our Strife, let thy grave Counsel end. Calchas. The usual means, Fates of Return afford The Greeks. To th'Tomb of the Thessalian Lord The Virgin must be sacrific'd; so drest As Grecian Brides are at their Nuptial Feast, And, Pyrrhus, wedded to thy Sire by thee, With these due Rites shall she espoused be. Yet is not this our Fleets sole Remora. More noble Blood than thine, Polyxena, The Fates require. Great Hector's only Son From some high Turret must be headlong thrown; So have the Gods decreed he should be slain. Then may your conquering Navy plough the Main. CHORUS. Is it a Truth? or Fiction blinds Our fearful Minds? That when to Earth we Bodies give, Souls yet do live? That when the Wife hath clos'd with Cries The Husband's Eyes, When the last fatal Day of Light Hath spoil'd our Sight, And when to Dust and Ashes turn'd Our Bones are urn'd; Souls stand yet in no need at all Of Funeral. But that a longer Life with Pain They still retain? Or dye we quite? Nor ought we have Survives the Grave? When like to Smoak immix'd with Skies, The Spirit flies. And Funeral Tapers are apply'd To th'naked Side. Whate'er Sol rising does disclose, Or setting shows; Whate'er the Sea with flowing Waves Or ebbing laves; Old Time, that moves with winged pace, Doth soon deface. With the same Swiftness the Signs rowl Round, round the Pole, With the same Course Day's Ruler steers The fleeting Years; With the same Speed th'oblique-pac'd Moon Does wheeling run: We all are hurried to our Fates, Our Lives last Dates; And when we reach the Stygian Shore, Are then no more. As Smoak, which springs from Fire, is soon Dispers'd and gone; Or Clouds which we but now beheld, By Winds dispel'd; The Spirit, which informs this Clay, So fleets away. Nothing is after Death; and this Too, Nothing is: The Gaol, or the extreamest space Of a swift Race. The Covetous their Hopes forbear, The Sad their Fear. Ask'st thou, whene'er thou com'st to dye, Where thou shalt lye? Where lye th'unborn. Away Time rakes us, Then Chaos takes us. Death's Individual; like kind To Body or Mind. Whate'er of Tænarus they sing, And Hell's fierce King, How Cerberus still guards the Port O'th' Stygian Court, All are but idle Rumours found, And empty Sound; Like the vain Fears of Melancholy Dreams, and fabulous Folly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. ANDROMACHE, SENEX, ASTYANAX mute. Andromache. Why tear you thus your Hair, and weeping beat Your wretched Breasts, ye Phrygian Dames? We yet Suffer but lightly, if we suffer what Is only to be wept. Troy fell but late To you, to me long since. When in our view Cruel Achilles at his Chariot drew My Hector's Limbs; whilst with a Weight unknown The trembling Axletree did seem to groan. Then, then was Troy o'erthrown, then Ilium fell; Sense of that Grief makes me unsensible. And now by Death freed from Captivity I'd follow Hector; but this Boy here, he Witholds me; he (sweet Child) my Will restrains, And from a much-desired Death detains. 'Tis he that makes me yet the Gods intreat; He to my Griefs a longer time hath set. And though my greatest Comfort, took from me The greatest Comfort in my Misery, Security from Fear; no place doth rest For happier Fortune with the worst opprest And saddest Miseries: “For to fear still, “When Hope hath left us, is the worst of Ill. Senex. What sudden Fear does thy sad Mind surprize? Andromache. From our great Ills still greater Ills arise. Nor yet can Iliums fatal Woes have end. Senex. What further Miseries does Heaven intend? Andromache. Hell's open'd; and our Foes, that we might ne'er Want Terrour, rising from their Graves appear. And can this only to the Greeks befall? Sure Death is equally the same to all. That common Fear all Phrygians doth distress; But my sad Dream doth me alone oppress. Senex. Declare, what did thy dreadful Dream present? Andromache. Two parts of quiet Night were almost spent, And now the Seven Triones had wheel'd round Their glittering Wain, when Rest (a Stranger found To my afflicted Thoughts) in a short Sleep Upon my wearied Eyes did gently creep, (If such Amaze of Mind yet Sleep may be.) Strait to my thinking I did Hector see. Not such, as when against the Argives bent On Grecian Ships, Idæan Flames he sent; Nor such, when he his Foes with slaughter strook, And real Spoils from false Achilles took. Nor did his sprightly Eyes with Lightning glance, But with a sad dejected Countenance Like mine, he stood; his Hair all soil'd and wet, (It joyed me though, even such to see him yet.) His Head then shaking, thus at length he spake; Awake, my dear Andromache, awake, And quickly hence Astyanax convey; Let him be closely hid; no other way Is left to save him: Thy sad Cries forbear. Griev'st thou Troy's fall'n? Would God it wholly were. Quickly dispatch, and to some secret place Convey this last small Hopes of all our Race. Sleep from my Senses a cold Horrour shook, When staring round with an affrighted Look, Wretch, I (my Child forgot) for Hector sought; But lo the fleeting shadow, whilst I thought To have embrac'd it, fled. O my dear Joy, True Bloud of thy great Sire, sole Hopes of Troy! Unhappy Issue of too fam'd a Race! Too like thy Father; even such a Face My Hector had; his Gait such, so he bare His conq'ring Arms; so did his curled Hair Part on his threatning Forehead, so from's Head Covering his Neck, 'bout his tall Shoulders spread. O Son, too late unto thy Country born, Too soon unto thy Mother! will that Turn, That happy Revolution never come, That I mey see thee build up Ilium, And her fled Citizens reduce once more, And to their Town and them their Name restore? But I forget my self, and fondly crave Too happy things: “Enough poor Captives have “If they may live. What place Wretch, can secure Thy Fears? Sweet Child, where shall I hide thee sure? That late proud Palace, rich in Wealth and Fame. Built by the Gods, worthy ev'n Envy's Aim, Is now to a rude heap of Ashes turn'd, All's levell'd with the Ground, the whole Town burn'd In wastful Flames; nor doth there now abide So much of Troy as may one Infant hide. What place would fittest serve for my intent? Hard by's my Husbands stately Monument, Which ev'n the Enemy doth reverence, Which with much Cost, nor less Magnificence, (On his own Sorrows too too prodigal) Old Priam built; there I may best of all Intrust him with his Sire.—A cold Sweat flows O'er all my Limbs, my Mind distracted grows, And dreads the Omen of the dismal place. Senex. “Oft a suppos'd Destruction (in this case) “Men from a real Ruine hath preserv'd. No other Hope of Safety is reserv'd. A great and fatal Weight on him doth lie, The Greatness of his own Nobility. Andromache. Pray Heav'n no one discover or betray him. Senex. Let there be none to witness where you lay him. Andromache. How if the Enemy demand the Boy? Senex. Say, He was murder'd in insubverted Troy. Andromache. What boots it to lie hid a while, that past, To fall into their cruel Hands at last? Senex. Despair not, hope for better Fate: “The first “Charge of the Victors Fury is the worst. Andromache. Alas, what should we hope, if he can ne'er Be kept conceal'd without apparent Fear? Senex. “Choice of their Safety the Secure may make, “Those in distress must hold of any take. Andromache. What desert place or unfrequented Land Will give thee safe Repose? What friendly Hand Protect us? To our Fears who'll Comfort yield? O thou who always didst, thy own now shield, Great Hector! This dear Treasure from thy Wife Receive, let thy dead Ashes guard his Life. Come, Child, enter this Tomb; back why dost start? Scorn'st thou to lurk in Holes? His Fathers Heart In him I see; he shames to fear.—Quit, quit Thy Princely Thoughts now, and take such as fit Thy present state. See all of Ilium That's left, a Child, a Captive, and a Tomb. Submit to Heavens Decree, nor fear to enter Thy Fathers Monument; go, boldly venture. There, if on Wretches Fates Compassion have, Thou'lt Safety find; if Death they give, a Grave. Senex. He's hid: but lest thy Fears should him betray, Remove some distance hence another way. Andromache. “The nearer that we fear, we fear the less: But if you please, let us withdraw— Senex. Whist! Peace: Madam, your sad Complaints a while suspend, The Cephalenian Prince this way does bend. Andromache. Cleave, Earth! and thou, dear Spouse, rend up the Ground From lowest Hell, and in that dark Profound Hide our Loves Pledge. He comes, he comes, his Pace And Looks speak Plots; there's Mischief in his Face. Scene II. Enter ULYSSES. Ulysses. Tho to promulgate a severe Decree I come; I beg you'll be so just to me, As not to think the rigorous Sentence mine, But what the Votes of all the Greeks enjoyn. Whose late Return to their lov'd Homes withstands Great Hector's Heir: Him Destiny demands. Still doubtful Hopes of an uncertain Peace, And fear of Vengeance will the Greeks oppress, Nor suffer them to lay down Arms so long As thy Son lives, Andromache. Andromache. This Song Does Calchas your great Prophet sing? Ulysses. Although He had said nothing, Hector tells us so. Whose Stock we dread: “A generous Race aspires “Unto the Worth and Virtue of their Sires. So the great Herds small Playfellow, which now Sports in the Pastures with scarce budded Brow, Strait with advanced Crest and armed Head, Commands the Flock which late his Father led. And so the tender Sprout of some tall Tree Late fell'd, shoots up in a short time to be Equal to that from whence it sprung, and lends To Earth a Shade, to Heav'n its Boughs extends. So the small Ashes of a mighty Fire Carelessly left, into new Flames aspire. “Grief does indeed Matters unjustly state, “And makes of things but a wrong Estimate. Yet if your Case you duly shall perpend, You'll not think strange if after Ten Years end, Th'old Soldier spent with Toil new Wars should fear, And never enough ruin'd Troy; for ne'er Can we enjoy Security of Mind, Our selves not safe, whilst still we fear to find Another Hector in Astyanax. Then rid us of this Terror that thus wracks Our Thoughts. This is the only cause of stay Unto our Fleet, ready to wing its way. Nor think me cruel, 'cause by Fates compell'd I Hector's Son require; had Heav'n so will'd, I had as soon ask'd Agamemnon's Son, Than suffer what the Victor's self hath done. Andromache. Would God, dear Child, I had thee in my Hand, Or knew thy present Fortune, or what Land Now harbours thee; though Swords transpierc'd my Breast, Though galling Chains my captiv'd Hands opprest, Or Flames beset me round, they ne'er should move My Heart to quit a Mothers Faith or Love. Poor Infant, O where art thou? what strange Fate Is fall'n on thee? Wandrest thou desolate In untrac'd Fields? Or perish'dst thou, my Joy, Amidst the Smoke and Flames of burning Troy? Or hath the Victor in a wanton Mood Of Cruelty plaid with thy childish Blood, And murder'd thee in sport? Or by some Beast Slain, do thy Limbs Idæan Vultures feast? Ulysses. Come, come, dissemble not; 'tis had to cheat Ulysses: Know we can the Plots defeat Of Mothers although Goddesses. Away With these vain Shifts, and where thy Son is, say. Andromache. Where's Hector? Priam? all the Trojans? You For one ask, I for all. Ulysses. Torture shall scrue, Since our Persuasions cannot gain a free, A forc'd Confession from thee. Andromache. Alas she Is 'gainst the worst of Fate secured still, That die not only can, but ought, and will. Ulysses. These Boasts at Deaths approach will quickly fly. Andromache. No, Ithacus; if me thou'dst terrifie, Threaten me Life, for Death's my wish. Ulysses. Fire, Blows, And Tortures shall enforce thee to disclose The Secrets of thy Breast. “Oft-times we see “Severity works more than Lenity. Andromache. Doom me to Flames, dissect with Wounds, and try All torturing Arts that witty Cruelty Did e'er devise; Thirst, Famine, all Plagues, through My Bowels burning Irons thrust; or muc Me up in some dark noisom Dungeon: And (If yet you think not these enough) command Whatever Cruelties on captiv'd Foes A haughty barbarous Victor dare impose: No Tortures e'er shall a Confession wrest, Nor Terrors daunt my stout Maternal Brest. Ulysses. This obstinate Love thou to thy Child dost bear Warns all the Greeks to like parental Care. After a War so far, so long, less I Shold fear the Ills Calchas does prophecy. Fear'd I but for my self: But 'tis not us Thou threatst alone, but my Telemachus. Andromache. And must I Comfort then afford my Foes Against my Will? I must.—Sorrow disclose Thy hidden Griefs. Now ye Atrides, chear! And be thou still to Greeks the Messenger Of happy News, Great Hector's Son is dead. Ulysses. Where be the Proofs may make this credited? Andromache. So fall on me what e'er the Victor's Rage May threat; so Fates to my maturer Age An easie close; and where I had my Birth Afford me Burial: So may the Earth Lie light on Hector's Bones, as he bereav'd Of Light lies 'mongst the Dead, and hath receiv'd The dues of Funeral. Ulysses. Fate's in his Fate Accomplish'd, and firm Peace to Greece, then strait Pronounce, Ulysses.—Stay, fond Man, what dost? Shall Grecians thee, and thou a Mother trust? Perhaps the feigns, nor fears her dreadful Curse. Fear Imprecations they that fear nought worse? Sh'as sworn 'tis true; if so, than her Son's loss What can she fear to her a heavier Cross? Now summon all thy Slights together; be Wholly Ulysses. Truth's ne'er long hid. We Must sift her throughly.—See, shee weeps, sighs, mourns. With anxious steps, now this, now that way turns. And our Words catches with a heedful Ear; We must use Art, she does not grieve, but fear. That with the Sorrows of some Mothers we Condole 'tis fit, but we must gratulate thee, Happy in Misery and thy Sons loss! For whom a heavier Death intended was, Who from that lofty Tower which now alone Remains of Troy was destin'd to be thrown. Andromache. My Heart faints, Fear shakes all my Joynts, a cold Congealing Frost upon my Blood lays hold. Ulysses. See, see, she trembles; this must be the way. Her Fears a Mothers Love in her betray. I'll fright her further yet.—Go, search with speed This Foe, that by his Mothers Fraud is hid, This onely Plague of Greece; find him where'er He lies.—So, have y'him? bring him here. Why lookst thou back and tremblest?—Now he dies. [To himself. Andromache. Would God this Fear from present grounds did rise; 'Las, 'tis with us habitual. “The Mind “From what it long hath learnt is late declin'd. Ulysses. Since thy Sons better Fate prevented hath The lustral Sacrifice, thus Calchas saith, Our Fleet may hope return if we appease With Hector's Ashes the incensed Seas, And raze his Monument unto the Ground. Now since the Son by Death a way hath found To scape the Justice of his destin'd Doom. We must exact it from his Father's Tomb. Andromache. What shall I do? My Mind a double Fear Distracts; here my poor Child, the Ashes there Of my dear Husband. Which shall I first prize? Bear witness, ye relentless Deities, And thy blest Manes, real Gods to me! Nought, Hector, in my Son I pleasing see But thy self only: Long then may he live Thy Representative.—And shall I give My Husbands Ashes to the Waves? O'er vast Seas suffer that his rifled Bones be cast? Let t'other rather die.—And canst thou be Spectatress of thy own Childs Tragedy? See him thrown headlong from the Tower's steep height? I can and will, rather than Hector yet Be after Death the Victor's Spoil again. Think yet this lives, hath Sense, can feel his Pain, Whilst t'other Fates from Ills secured have. Why staggerest thou? resolve strait which to save. Ingrateful, doubt'st thou? There thy Hector is. Mistaken Wretch, either is Hector: This Yet young and living, who in time may be Th'Avenger of his Father's Death—Still we Cannot save both.—Resolve o'th' two howe'er To save him yet whom most the Grecians fear. Ulysses. The Prophet's Words shall be fulfill'd; the place I will demolish. Andromache. Which ye sold. Ulysses. Deface The Monument. Andromache. The Faith of Gods and thee, Achilles, we appeal to. Pyrrhus, see Thy Father's Gift made good. Ulysses. Down it shall go, And with its Ruines the wide Champain strow. Andromache. No Wickedness, ye Greeks, have ye refrain'd, But this alone; Temples you have profan'd, And Gods propitious to you; yet ye spar'd The Mansions of the Dead. I am prepar'd To hinder their intent, and will oppose With weak unarmed Hands these armed Foes. Anger and Indignation strengthen me! Penthesilea-like I'll 'mongst them flie, Or mad Agave, that the Woods did trace, Shaking her Thyrsus with a frantick pace, Dealing dire Wounds insensibly, and by Defending bear his Ashes company. Ulysses. What does a Womans Passion move your Hearts, And vainer Cries? On Slaves, and ply your parts. Andromache. First by your bloody Hands let me be slain. Up from Avernus! Break thy fatal Chain! Rise, Hector! Rise! Ulysses to subdue, Thy Ghost alone will be sufficient. View How Arms he brandishes! How Flames do fly From his stout Hands! See y' him? Or is it I That see him only? Ulysses. Down with't to the ground. Andromache. What dost? Wilt see one Ruine then confound Father and Son? Perhaps my Prayers may yet Appease them; strait resolve, or else the Weight O'th' falling Tomb will crush thy Child to death. First lose he any where his wretched Breath, Or e'er the Father the Son's Ruine be, Or Son the Father's.—Thus, Ulysses, we Low as thy Knees fall, and beneath thy Feet These Hands (which yet no Mans e'er touch'd) submit. Pity a Mothers Woes, with Patience hear Her pious Plaints, and lend a Gentle Ear. “And how much higher Heav'n hath advanc'd thy state, “So much the less depress a Wretches Fate. “When to the miserable we extend “Our Charity, we unto Fortune lend. So to the chast Embraces of thy Wife May'st thou in peace return, and Fates the Life Of old Laertes, till that day extend. So may thy Son, thy Age's hope, transcend Thy Hopes and Wishes, live more Years to see Than hath his Grandsire, wiser prove than thee. O pity! All my Comfort's in this Boy. Ulysses. Produce him first, then what you ask enjoy. Scene III. ULYSSES, ANDROMACHE, ASTYANAX. Andromache. Forth from the hollow Entrals of the Tomb Thou wretched Theft of thy sad Mother come! The Terror of a Thousand Ships here see, Ulysses, this poor Child! down on thy Knee, Thy Lord, with humble Reverence adore, And Mercy, with submissive Hands, implore. Nor think it shame for Wretches to submit To what e'er Fortune wills; the Thoughts now quit Of thy great Ancestors, nor Priam call To mind, nor his great Pow'r; forget it all, And Hector too: assume a Captives state. And though unsensible of thy own Fate, Poor Wretch, thou be, yet from our Sense of Woes Example take, weep as thy Mother does. 'Tis not the first time Troy hath seen her Prince Shed Tears: So Priam, when a Child long since The Wrath of stern Alcides pacifi'd; He who so fierce was, who in strength outvy'd Ev'n Monsters, who from Hell's forc'd Gates could yet Through ways impervious open a Retreat: Quell'd by the Tears of his small Enemy; Resume (says he) thy former Royalty, And in thy Father's Throne and Empire reign. But Faith more firmly than he did, maintain. Happy that such a Victor him did seize! Learn thou the gentle Wrath of Hercules. Or only please his Arms? See 'fore thine Eyes No less a Suppliant than that Suppliant lies; And begs but only Life, his Crown and State He leaves to Fortune and the Will of Fate. Ulysses. Trust me the Mothers Sorrow moves me much, But nearer me the Grecian Mothers touch, To whose no little Grief this Child aspires. Andromache. And shall he then the Ruines which these Fires Have made, repair? These Hands erect Troy's Fall? Poor are the hopes she has if these be all. We Trojans are not so subdu'd, that yet We should to any be a Fear: is't Great Hector in him you look at? Think withal, That Hector yet was dragg'd 'bout Ilium's Wall. Nay, he himself, did he now live to see Troy's Fate, would of an humbler Spirit be. “Great Minds by pressures great Ills are broke. Or would you punish? Than a slavish Yoke What to free Necks more grievous? let him bring His Mind to serve. This who'll deny a King? Ulysses. Not we, but Calchas this denies to thee. Andromache. O thou damn'd Author of all Villany! Thou, by whose Valour none yet ever dy'd, Whose Treacheries the Greeks themselves have try'd. The Prophet and th'abused Deities Dost thou pretend? No, 't's thine own Enterprize, Thou base Night-Soldier. Thou whose Manhood's Proof The Sun ne'er witness'd; only stout enough To kill a Child: Now thou may'st brag and say, Thou hast dar'd something yet in open day. Ulysses. Enough the Greeks, too well the Trojans know Ulysses Worth; but time we cannot now Spend in vain Talk. The Fleet does Anchor weigh. Andromache. Yet so much time afford us, as to pay A Mother's last Dues to my dying Boy; And by our strict Embraces satisfie My greedy Sorrows. Ulysses. Would our Power would give Thy Woes Relief; yet what we can receive, As long a time as thou thy self shalt please To grieve and weep. “Tears Sorrow's Burthen ease. Andromache. O thou sweet Pledge of all my hopes! the Grace Of a now ruin'd, but once glorious Race! Terror of Greece! the Period of all Thy Countries Ruines! her last Funeral! Vain Comfort of thy wretched Mother! Who (Fondly, God knows) of Heaven did often sue, Thou mightst in War thy Father equallize, In Peace thy Grandsire; but Heav'n both denies. The Ilian Sceptre thou shalt never sway, Nor shall the Phrygian Realms thy Laws obey, Nor conquer'd Nations stoop thy Yoke to bear. The Greeks thou ne'er shalt foil, nor Pyrrhus e'er, T'avenge thy Sire, at thy proud Chariot trail: Nor with light brandish'd Arms wild Beasts assail In the wide Forests: Nor, when e'er it falls, Shalt solemnize Troy's chief of Festivals, And well-train'd Troops in noble Motions lead: Nor 'bout the sacred Altars nimbly tread; And when exciting Notes shrill Cornets sound, In Phrygian Temples dance an antick round. A Death than Death it self more sad, for thee Remains; and Trojan Walls shall something see More woful yet than Hector dragg'd. Ulysses. Here close Thy mournful Plaints; immoderate Sorrow knows No Bounds. Andromache. The time we for our Tears demand, Alas, is small; permit yet with this Hand I close his Eyes in Life though not in Death. Dear Child, although so young thou lose thy Breath, Yet thou dy'st fear'd. Go, thy Troy looks for thee; Go, and in Freedom thy free Trojans see. Astyanax. O pity, Mother! Andromache. 'Las, why dost thou wring My Hand, and to my Side (vain refuge!) cling? As when a sucking Fawn a Lion spies, Or roaring hears, strait to the Hind it flies: Yet the fierce Beast frightning the Dam away, With murdering Fangs seizes the tender Prey. So from my Bosom will the cruel Foe Drag thee, poor Child! Yet (Dearest) e'er thou go Take my last Kisses, Tears, and this torn Hair; Then to thy Father full of me repair. Tell him, if former Passions Ghosts do move, Nor Funeral Flames extinguish those of Love, Hector is much to blame, to let his Wife, Enthrall'd by Greeks, thus lead a Servile Life, Though he lie still, Achilles yet could rise. Take from my Head again, and from my Eyes, These Tears and Tresses; all that now is left Andromache, of Hector since bereft. These Kisses to thy Father bear from me: But leave this Robe, that may some Comfort be (When thou art gone) to thy poor Mother; this Did thy Sire's Tomb and sacred Ashes kiss: So shall these Lips, if any Reliques here Of their lov'd Dust, yet unshook off, appear. Ulysses. She'll ne'er have done;—“Grief knows not what is fit. Bear hence this stop of the Argolick Fleet. CHORUS. What Seats shall we poor Captives find? Where are our new Abodes design'd? Planted in hilly Thessalie, Or shady Tempe shall we be? Or sent to Phthia's rugged Fields? Phthia, which stoutest Soldiers yields. Or stony Trachis? fitter place For Cattle of a hardy Race. Shall us Iolchos entertain, Proud of the Conquest of the Main? Or Creet, whose spacious Land is round With Hundred of fair Cities crown'd? Or barren Tricca? small Gyrton? Or Modon with light Bents o'ergrown? Or the Oetœan Woods Recess, Which more than once to Troy's Distress Shafts fatal sent? Or must we store Thin-peopl'd Olenos with more? Or unto Pleuron shall we go, Pleuron the Virgin Dians Foe? Or to fair-harbourd Træzen get? Or Pelion, Prothous proud Seat? Third step to Heaven, where Chiron laid In's Cell, which eating time had made In the Hill's side, oft us'd to whet His Pupil's Courage, (then too great) By singing to his Harp's tun'd Strings Battles and bloody Bickerings? Or make Carystus, rich in vein'd Marble, with various Colours stain'd? Or Chalcis, plac'd on a rough Shore, Where the swift Euripus does roar? Or shelter in Calydnæ find, Easily reach'd by any wind? Or Gonoessa, which ne'er fails Of stormy Blasts and bustering Gales? Or to Enispæ shall we steer, Which Boreas angry Breath doth fear? For Sea-girt Peparethos stand, Which lies 'gainst Acte's pointed Land? Or seek Eleusis through the Deep, Where silent Festivals they keep? Or Ajax his true Salamine? Or Calydon, by a wild Swine His furious Mischiefs fam'd? Or make For Bessa and Scarphe, where the Lake Like Titaressus with dull Waves Creeping along, the Vallies laves? Or shall we at the last set down In Pylos, aged Nestor's Town? Pharis, Jove's Pisa, Elis see, Adorn'd with Wreaths of Victory? Let any Winds our Canvas fill, And bear us to what Lands they will, So we poor Wretches Sparta miss, That bred the Bane of Troy and Greece; So we at least from Argos run, So we the proud Mycenæ shun. So we in Neritos ne'er plant, Shorter and narrower the Zant. So we ne'er reach the treacherous Bay, And Shoals of rocky Ithaca. Who, Hecuba, can tell thy Fate? (Of Queens the most unfortunate!) What servile Hardships shalt thou try? Where, or in whose Dominions dye?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. HELENA, ANDROMACHE, HECUBA, and POLYXENA. Helena. Wherever Hymen is unfortunate, On whom Sighs, Mourning, Blood and Slaughter wait, There Helen's a fit Auspex, forc'd t'extend The Woes of ruin'd Troy beyond their End. False News of Pyrrhus Nuptials I must bear, Gems, and Greek Habits for his Bride to wear. Whilst (circumvented by my treacherous Wile) I Paris Sister of her Life beguile; And beguil'd be she. “'Tis a Courtesie “Unprepossess'd with fear of Death, to dye: Why doubt'st thou to perform thy Task? “On those “The Guilt of inforc'd Crimes lies, who impose. Thou Female Glory of the Dardan Race! Heaven now begins to shew a friendlier Face To the Afflicted; does a Mate provide, Such as not Priam could in all Troy's Pride. For thee to lawful Hymen's sacred Rites, The Chief of the Pelasgian Name, invites, Who rules wide Thessaly: Thee Tethys, all The watry Powr's, thee, hers will Thetis call, The Seas mild Empress! Pyrrhus marry thee, Thou Niece to Peleus shalt, and Nereus be. Put off these sad, and festive Habits take, Unlearn thou Captive art, and Captive make. Thy Hair frightfully staring, recommand To order, by some curious Dressers Hand. This chance may raise thee to a better State; “Captivity hath made some fortunate. Andromache. Was this then only wanting to our Woes? This? To rejoyce, when Troy in Ashes glows? O time for Nuptials fit! But who denies, Or doubts to wed, when Helen does advise? Helen the Bane, the Ruin, and the Pest Of either Nation; See these Graves! where rest Their valiant Chiefs! These Fields! 'Bout which are spread The bared Bones, sad Reliques of their Dead. These, these, thy Marriage scatter'd, with a flood Of Europe's best, and Asia's bravest Blood: Whilst thou at ease saw'st both thy Husbands fight, Careless on which the Victory should light. Go then, and for these Wedding Joys prepare! For Nuptial Lights and Torches never care; Troy's Flames will those supply. Now Troades The Marriage Rites of Pyrrhus solemnize As they deserve; that is, with Tears and Cries. Helen. Though mighty Grief no Curb, no Reason knows, But oft hates those are sharers in its Woes; Yet 'fore a partial Judge can I defend My Cause; who suffer more than you pretend. Andromache for Hector, Hecuba For Priam, freely mourns, I closely pay My conceal'd Sighs for Paris. 'Tis severe, Hateful and sad, a servile Yoak to bear. Yet that have I endur'd, these Ten Years past. Your Houshold Gods are sack'd; Ilium laid wast. To lose ones native Land, is a sad Curse; To fear, like me, without Relief, yet worse. A fellow-sufferance does your Woes asswage. 'Gainst me, the Victors both, and vanquish'd rage. Whom you must serve, Chance yet hath scarce design'd, I'm sure, without a Lot, a Lord to find. You'll say I was to Troy the cause of War, And her sad Ruin. Take what you infer, To be a Truth; if you can prove that e'er A Spartan Ship me to your Coasts did bear. But if by Phrygians I a Prize was made, And to her Judge a Gift by Venus paid, Excuse then Paris. For our Cause, 'twill come 'Fore a rough Judge; it waits Atrides Doom. But now, Andromache, thy Plaints laid by A while, to bow this resolute Virgin try. I scarce can hold from Tears.— Andromache. The thing is sad That Helen weeps for; it must needs be bad. But wherefore weeps she? say! What new Deceit? What Mischief plots Ulysses, that grand Cheat? Must from Idæan Rocks the Maid be cast? Or from this Tow'r, or yond' Clifts, into vast Seas hurld? where with his crook'd and ragged side Lofty Sygæum does imbay the Tide? Speak! What beneath thy Looks sly Vail is laid? No ill, but's less, than Pyrrhus to be made To Priam Son in Law, and Hecuba. What Pains, what Torments, must we suffer? say! For this from our Woes Sum may well be spar'd; To be deceiv'd. To dye, w'are all prepar'd. Helen. Would Heav'n, the Gods Interpreter had doom'd Me to have dy'd; and at Achilles Tomb By Pyrrhus furious Hand t'have fall'n! That I With thy sad Fate, Polyxena! might vye, Whom Thetis Son (t'his Grave first Victim made) Demands for Spouse in the Elysian shade. Andromache. See how great Joy does her high Soul express At her declar'd Death! Royal Robes and Dress Now she assumes, now yields t'adorn her head; To dye she Marriage thinks, but Death to wed. Her aged Mother yet at the Report, Is Thunder strook; nor more can Grief support, With this Surcharge opprest.—Courage! recall Your Life and Spirits, Madam?—On how small A Thread hers hang!—How little will suffice T'ease Hecuba of all her Miseries! She breaths, and comes t'her self again:—I find Death to the miserable is unkind. Hecuba Yet lives Achilles to the Phrygians Woe? Yet does he plague us? Is he still our Foe? O Paris feeble Hand! his very Grave And Ashes thirst our wretched Blood to have. Once me a happy Troop of Children round On every side enclos'd; enough I found T'impart to all my Kisses; nor could tell 'Mong such a fair and numerous Issue, well How to divide a Mother. Now, there's none Left me but this, my sole Companion, My Joy and Comfort in Affliction This, this poor Girl; the last Remain of all Hecuba's Race! she only lives to call Me Mother.—Leave hard-temper'd Soul my Breast! And this one Funeral after all the rest Remit at length to me. She changes hue, A show'r of Tears does her pale Cheeks bedew. Rejoice dear Child! gladly Andromache, Gladly Cassandra thus espous'd would be. Andromache. We, we poor Wretches, Hecuba, are most To be deplor'd; who must on Seas be tost, Now here, now there, and God knows whither hurry'd? She's happy; by Fates destin'd to be bury'd In her own Native Land. Helen. You'd grieve yet more Did you but know what Lot's for you in store. Andromache. Is of my woes yet any Part unknown? Helen. The Captives Dooms th impartial Urn hath shown. Andromache. Whose Slave am I? Whom must I master call? Helen. Unto the Syrian Youth, by Lot you fall. Andromache. Happy Cassandra! whom Prophetic Rage And Phœbus from the Lot does disengage. Helen. She's Agamemnon's Prize. Hecuba. Is Hecuba By any sought for? Helen. You a short-liv'd Prey Are to Ulysses, 'gainst his Will, become. Hecuba. O who could be Dispenser of a Doom So cruel and tyrannical! that brings Queens to be Slaves to those that are not Kings? What God does so unluckily dispose Poor Captives? What stern Judg, unto our Woes Weight adding, does so little understand To chuse us Lords? and with a rigorous Hand Deals such cross Fates to Wretches? What dire Lot T'Achilles Arms does Hector's Mother put? Given to Ulysses!—Now indeed distress'd I seem; with all Calamities oppress'd. I shame at such a Lord, not Servitude. Must he then who Achilles Spoils indu'd, Have Hector's too? And must the barren, small, And Sea-girt Ithaca give me Funeral? Lead, lead, Ulysses, when you please; no stay I'll make, but follow thee, my Lord. And may My own Fates follow me. No Calms asswage The angry Seas, let them with Tempests rage. May Wars, Fire, mine and Priam's Miseries Pursue you; and till those Plagues come, suffice It, this is sure: You have your Lot; I yet Have rob'd you of all hop'd-for Benefit. But see, with a precipitated pace Where Pyrrhus comes? with Fury in his Face. Pyrrhus, why stop'st thou in thy bloody Race? Sheath in this Breast thy Sword: let Death in fine Achilles Father-in-law and Mother join. Go on thou Murderer of the Aged! On! This Blood fits thee: to Execution Drag hence a Captive Wretch: And by so vile Abhor'd a Slaughter, Gods above defile, And Ghosts below.—What, shall I pray for you? Seas to such dismal Sacrifices due. On your whole Fleet, your thousand Ships, like Curse Fall, I wish that shall carry me, or Worse. CHORUS. Of mix'd Trojans, comforting themselves by their Community of Sorrows. To those that Mourn, 'tis sweet Relief, When Nations Sorrows eccho to their Grief. Less felt is that Afflictions Sore Which numerous Sharers mutually deplore. Sorrow is like Infection; loves t'obtrude It self upon a Multitude. And counts it some Content, Not singly to lament. There none denies to bear that Fate All suffer under: in a common Wo None thinks himself unfortunate, Tho he be so. Take hence the Happy, lay the Rich aside, Whose Gold and fertile Acres is their Pride; The Poor will raise their drooping Heads. There's none Miserable but by Comparison. To those by great Calamities o'ertook 'Tis sweet to see none wear a chearful Look. Sadly that Man his Fate bewails, Who in a Private Vessel sails; And naked, helpless, and forlorn, Sinks in the Port to which his Course was born. Storms and his Fate he bears with evener mind, Who sees a thousand Ships before him drown'd, And all the Shore scatter'd with Wrecks does find, Whilst Waves by Corus dash'd 'gainst Rocks resound. Phrixus for Helle's single Loss complain'd, When by the Gold-fleec'd Leader of the Flock They both were took (Brother and Sister) on his Back. And she in Mid-Seas fell a helpless Wrack. Deucalion yet and Pyrrha, both refrain'd From Tears, when they the swelling Sea beheld, And nothing but the Sea that swell'd; Of Lost Mankind, all that remain'd. But these sad Meetings, these our mutual Tears Spent to deplore our miserable State, The Fleet, which ready now to sail appears Will strait dissolve and dissipate. Soon as the Trumpets hasty Sound shall call The Mariners aboard, and all With favouring Gales and Oars for Sea shall stand, When from our Sight shall fly our dear-lov'd Land: What Fears will then our wretched Thoughts surprize, To see the Land to sink, and the Sea rise? When Ida's tow'ring Height Shall vanish from our Sight; The Child shall then unto its Mother say, The Mother to the Child, pointing that way Which tends unto the Phrygian Coast; Lo! yonder's Ilium where you spy Those Clouds of Smoke to scale the Sky. By this sad Sign, when all Marks else are lost, Trojans their Country shall descry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. NUNCIUS, ANDROMACHE and HECUBA. Nuncius. O horrid, cruel, cursed Fates! what Crime Hath bloody Mars yet seen in ten years time Like sad or barbarous! where shall I begin? With your Woes, Madam? Or yours, Aged Queen? Hecuba. Whose Woes soe'er you tell, they're mine; each Breast Bears its own Griefs, but mine's with all opprest, The universal Sorrow: None can say He's wretched, but he's such to Hecuba. Nuncius. The Virgin's sacrific'd, and the Youth cast From the Tow'rs Height: both Brave yet to the last. Andromache. Relate the Series of their Deaths: declare This double Tragedy: I long to hear The Sum of all my Griefs. Speak then and show Th'intire Complement of all my Wo. Nuncius. A Tow'r yet stands; All now that's left of Troy, Whence, bearing in his Arms his Age's Joy, His little Grandson; Priam us'd to view His Troops, and order what those Troops should do. Thence (when brave Hector in that glorious Fight What time the routed Greeks he chac'd in flight With Sword and Fire) to young Astyanax The old King show'd his Father's valiant Acts. This noted Tow'r, once our Walls cheifest Grace, (Now a curs'd Rock, and a detested Place) Huge Crowds of Soldiers with their Troops surround. A Seaman scarce to guard the Fleet is found. All thither flock: To some a Hill does lend From far an open Prospect: Some ascend The rocky Cliffs, and there, eager to see, On Tiptoes stand. Some climb this neighbouring Tree, Some that: Th'adjoining Woods tremble to bear The numerous Spectators. Some here are Climb up steep Precipices. Some bestride Ridges of half-burnt Houses. Others ride On pieces of the broken Wall: And some To see his Son's Death, get on Hector's Tomb. Ulysses proudly stalks through all the Throng, As way was made; leading in's Hand along The Princely Youth, who makes no sluggish stop In this sad March; but gaining the Tow'r's top, Thence, here and there, with an undaunted Gest, Casts round his angry Eyes: Of some fierce Beast, As a young tender Cub, not able yet To tyrannize with murdering Fangs, does threat, And vainly snarls, and snaps, and swells with Rage; The Princely Captive on this lofty Stage Like Courage shows; and from all Hearts does force Compassion, ev'n Ulysses feels Remorse. He weeps not yet, for whom all else shed Tears. Now whilst Ulysses (as enjoin'd) prepares His solemn Speech; and with set Pray'rs invites The cruel Gods to those more cruel Rites, He nimbly of his own accord leaps down Amidst the Ruins of his State and Town. Andromache. What Colchian, or what wand'ring Scythian, Or Hyrcan, bordering on the Caspian Main, That knows no Law, would such an Act have dar'd? Cruel Busyris butchering Altars spar'd Yet Childrens Blood; nor ever Diomed His Horses with the Flesh of Infants fed. Who'll take thy Limbs and give them Funeral? Nuncius. What Limbs could there be left by such a Fall? His Bones were crush'd to pieces; nor one Grace, Or Mark was left in Body or in Face Resembling his illustrious Father: All Were utterly defac'd by the sad Fall. His Neck was broken. His Head 'gainst a Rock Encount'ring, dash'd his Brains out with the Knock. Nought but a shapeless Trunk he lay. Andromache. Ev'n so Too like his Father. Nuncius. From this Scene of Wo The Greeks next, (weeping yet for what they'd done) To act another Crime as barbarous run, In haste t'Achilles Tomb; whose farther side Rhetæan Waves beat with a gentle Tide. Th'Extreams to that oppos'd, a Champaign Ground Invests; in th'midst of which a Vale is found, From whose low Edge a hilly Ridge ascends, And 'bout it like a Theatre extends. The Shore is cover'd with the numerous Press. Some think this done in order to release Their Navy's stop; some look on the Design As meant t'extirpate all Troy's Hostile Line. Most of the giddy Vulgar seem to hate The Act, they come to see and perpetrate. Trojans attend too; and with fearful Eyes Expect the last of all Troy's Tragedies. When strait, as at our solemn Marriage Rites, In head of all, are born the Nuptial Lights: Next Helen, ar the Bride's sad Pronuba, Comes with dejected Mein; whilst Phrygians pray So may Hermione wed; and so may she Return'd with Shame to her first Husband be. Trojans and Greeks are both with Horror strook, When forth the Princess comes; with submiss Look, But Cheeks that dy'd in modest Blushes shine, More beautiful in this her sad Decline. As Phœbus seems to cast a sweeter Light Now near his Set, when the approaching Night Invades the Confines of the doubtful Day. The vulgar Minds are lost in strange Dismay; Who (as their Custom is) always commend Those who are going to their fatal End. Her Beauty some, others her Youth as much. Some the sense does of her chang'd Fortune touch. All her high Spirit praise; that Death dares meet. Fearless she out-steps Pyrrhus; whilst to see't, Some quake, some pity, some admire. Now come To the Land's Point, Pyrrhus his Father's Tomb Ascends; nor does the stout Virago shrink Or draw one Foot yet back, tho at Death's brink, But with a stern Look, Pyrrhus to provoke, Turns to receive the Sacrificing Stroke. Pity at once, and Wonder all Minds fill, Seeing her so brave, and Pyrrhus slow to kill. Soon as his Hand into her tender Breast Had forc'd the murthering Steel, a full Stream press'd Of bubling Gore through the large Wound: nor dy'd Her Courage yet: she fell as tho she try'd T'oppress Achilles in his Grave, and force The Earth to lye yet heavier on his Corse. Both sides, the Phrygians and the Greeks lament: These tim'rously, their Sighs those louder vent. This was the Order of the Sacrifice. Nor on the Grounds hard Surface stangnant lies, Or floats in streams the sacrificed Blood; The thirsty Grave soon drank up all the Flood. Hecuba. Go, go ye Greeks! now seek your Homes again, With your wing'd Fleet securely plough the Main, The Royal Virgin, and the Youth are slain. The War's now ended.—Would my Life were so. Where shall I bear this Burden of my Wo? How quit my Deaths vivacious Remora? For whom shall I my Tears sad Tribute pay? For my Girl? Grand-son? Husband? Country lost? Or for all these at once? or my self most? Whose only Wish is Death. Cruel! thou hy'st To murder Infants; to young Virgins fly'st: Each where mak'st hast to kill: But me alone Thou fear'st; and shun'st, though all Night call'd upon 'Mid'st Fire and Sword:—Nor Rage of hostile Pow'rs, Nor Flames, nor Ruins of Troy's falling Tow'rs, One poor old Woman could dispatch. How nigh To thee yet (Priam!) when thou fell'st, stood I? Nuncius. Away to Sea, ye Captives! Now unmor'd The Greek Fleet hoises Sail: Hast, hast abord. FINIS.</field>
