      <field name="fulltext">Iacob Twelue sonnes I haue, where of ten be to mans estate now come, to wit, Ruben, Simeon, Leui, Iuda, Isachar, &amp; Zabulon, who were of Lia borne: And two of Bala, Dan, &amp; Nepthali: And two of Zelpha, Gad &amp; Aser: The other children bee, The elder Ioseph cal'd, &amp; Beniamin the yonger lad, both wc h two sonnes by Rachel now in myne old age I had. &amp; for that cause I them affect more then any of the rest But yet of all the sonnes I haue I do loue Ioseph best. And though he be but sixtene yeares of age, &amp; yet a childe I often sende hym wt h his brothers to keepe sheepe in the fielde clad in a coate of sundry colours: But Beniamin I stay beinge yong'st of all at home wt h me to dryue the tyme away. But who ys this that cometh here? Ioseph yt seemes to bee: Yt's hee in deede. How do thy brothers? and are all things well wt h thee? Ioseph Not so well father as I wish: for to be playne my brothers grow scandalous to many, beinge become licentious lyuers where wt h I (father) you acquaynt, not for to haue them punished but hopeinge by your graue aduise, their lyues will be amended. Iacob And Ioseph as I loue not tayles but vpon iust occasion so I'l them heare when there's iust cause beinge tempered wt h discreation &amp; syth thou hast complayn'd to me, who thou thinkes able ys t'amend (because I am their father) all thinges in them amisse be thou assurde I will not spare, but them admonish fatherly as thou for their amendment hast complayned on them brotherly. But lest they should more malice thee, as they will yf they know that thou complaynd, before they hither come thou shalt hence go Ioseph In this &amp; all thinges I'l euer be at your commandment Iacob I thinke no lesse, &amp; therefore sonne be thou hence gone incontinent. Now after hym I'l go my self, &amp; that wt h out delay &amp; let them know my mynde, when I haue heard what they can say Simeon Brothers yt seemes the pratlinge boy complayn'd hath to our father of our behauiour: but perhaps his silence had bene better for yf occasion serue, be sure we'l euen wt h hym bee Leui Els were wee fooles, for none but such will shut vp such an iniury but here the tell tayle comes. Syrrha hast thou spitt out all thy poyson agaynst vs, or yet some reseru'd, till thou take new occasion Ioseph What I haue sayd, was for your good: for euill lyfe my breethren Ys odious both to god &amp; man, &amp; shuts the gate of heauen agaynst them that vse yt, &amp; drawes them headlonge downe to hell wherefore t'amend that fault in you my father I dyd tell syth my persuation could not moue you for to lyue more vertuously for your bad lyfe I do confesse dyd trouble me exceedingly Isachar Alas kynde foole, who would haue thought t'had bene so tender harted as for to greeue on our behalfe? th'art much to be commended, though not of vs, who know thy words were vttred in mere knauery to pyke a thanke thy self, &amp; make vs to be thought on hardly. Ioseph I sory am my fathers loue to me procures your hate &amp; makes you thus vnpeaceably to speake to me of late &amp; yet I'l take all in good part that you shall do or say hopeinge my patience will at length your hatred take away. And yf I may wt h out offence I'l tell you what I dreamed Simeon What s'euer yt be let's heare 't, though dreames be seldome to be trusted Ioseph I dream'd we bound sheaues in the field, &amp; that my sheafe vp started &amp; that your sheaues stoode round about my sheafe, &amp; yt adored Simeon What shalt thou be our kinge, &amp; we subiect to thy dominion? Ioseph I also had an other dreame, &amp; that a very strange one But here I see my father cominge, to tell yt I'l forbeare Iacob Nay sonne not so, what s'euer yt be, I pray thee lett me heare. Ioseph In my dreame I persuaded was that verely I did see as 'twere the Sunne &amp; moone &amp; eleauen starres adore mee Iacob. What meanes this dreame sonne thou hast seene? that both thy mother &amp; I &amp; thy eleauen brethren shall vpon the earth adore thee? Such dreames as these thou must not tell: &amp; yet I can not choose but wt h my self there of consider, &amp; at yt deepely muse Isachar This dreame perhaps geues hym content, but hath vs discontented &amp; yt may be that he will wish he had the same concealed, or other wyse dream'd, although we thinke dreames but to be fond fancies Iacob Be silent sonnes: let not this dreame occasion be of malice vpon my blessinge, but go about ech one your charge of sheepe wc h I in Sichem lattely you appoynted for to keepe, &amp; after you I'l shortly sende to see how all things are Ruben At your command we'l go, &amp; of our busines haue great care. But father we your blessinge craue ere we go hence away Iacob Gods blessinge sonnes &amp; myne vpon you light both night &amp; day. Ioseph thy brothers now are gone, let me &amp; thee go in there for to recreate our selues a while wt h litle Beniamin. &amp; after some few dayes are past I'l to thy Brethren sende thee to bringe them newes from mee, &amp; newes to me from them recary Ruben Brothers you see wee wysely dyd, when we our flockes remoued from Sichem hither vnto Dothain, for they are much amended since we their pastours chang'd, for here in Dothain's store of grasse where as in Sichem's litle, &amp; yt to rottinge subiect was So that yf now our father sende to know how our sheepe prosper good newes to hym we shall returne, that neuer they lyk't better Simeon And yf myne eyes deceiue me not, loe where the dreamer cometh Leui Yt's he in deede, come let's deuise how to put hym to death. Simeon we'l kill hym, &amp; his corps shall be in an old cestern hurled by vs, &amp; we will say some naughty wild beast hym deuoured, &amp; then what profit he got by hys dreame yt shall appeare. Ruben Neyther take his lyfe, nor sheede his blood, but in this cestern here wt h in the wildernes cast hym, &amp; so your hands keepe harmlesse for to his father I would hym saffe deliuer I do confesse. Leui Of thy syde coate of diuers colours dreamer thou shalt be stripped Ioseph Alas deare Brothers what's the matter that thus I must be vsed? In kyndnes hither, to see you brothers I was sent by my father Zabulon And for thy paynes we'l put thee in this cestern voyd of water Ruben Yt's better thus then in his blood your hands to haue imbrewed Let's now go looke our sheepe agayne lest any away be strayed Isachar This busines had almost made vs our flockes to haue forgotten But go &amp; we'l you follow so soone as wee this bread haue eaten. Gad What men are these that here do come? They passengers seeme to bee I musen whence they are, &amp; whither they intend their iourney Aser. Th'are Ismalits from Galaad come, &amp; in to Ãgypt trauellinge wt h rosen, spice, &amp; myrh to sell, for that's their vsuall tradinge Iuda What would yt vs avayle, yf that we should our brother murder &amp; then his blood conceale? yt is in my opinion better that he to th'Ismaelits be sould, our hands beinge vnpolluted for he's our brother &amp; our flesh of our father descended where fore out of this cestern come, let vs take hym agayne Simeon Agree'd, &amp; then we'l try yf that we can wt h these men bargayne freends will you buy this boy whose price ys thirty syluer peeces &amp; cary hym alonge wt h you amongst your other marchandyse Glaucus Wee are content, deliuer hym to vs, &amp; here's your money Iuda Lo there he is: fare well, &amp; good speede haue you in your iourney. Balbo My frendes adew. come pritty youth &amp; go wt h vs alonge, &amp; be no whit dismayd, for thou of vs shalt haue no wronge. Leui Now the Lad's gone, Let's see what th'effect of his dreames will bee Isachar Euen this: To free vs from complaynts, &amp; purchace vs more liberty for now there's none, who will discouer our doinges to our father wherefore let's merely go vnto our Sheepe after our brother. &amp; send his coate dipt in kyds blood by some body to his father who shall to hym in this wyse say: This we haue found, see whether Yt be thy sonnes or no: &amp; doubtlesse then he'l be persuaded when he his sonnes coate sees, that some wild beast hath hym deuoured &amp; neuer vs suspect to haue bereau'd hym of his sonne Leui We lyke well your deuise, &amp; to effect yt let's be gone. Ruben I haue my brothers lefte amongst their sheepe, &amp; am come hither vnknowne to them, Ioseph out of this cestern to deliuer. Ioseph come forth: be not afrayd, here's no body but I here oh Brothers o! whither shall I go? The boy doth not appeare. wt h sorrow I will go vnto my Brothers back agayne, for fully I persuaded am, they haue my brother slayne. Iacob I mervell much of all this while that Ioseph's not returned syth the day of his cominge home prefix't is now expyred Doilus ffather Iacob well mett: as I did through the desert go I did this fynde: See whether yt bee your sonnes coate or no &amp; so fare well, for at this tyme I can no longer stay. Iacob Here's some thinge for thy paynes, although thy news do much astonish mee what a syde coate? of diuers colours? &amp; all wt h blood besprinkled? doubtlesse yt ys my sonnes. Some naughty beast hath hym deuoured. Alas some beast hath Ioseph eaten. woe's mee that I was borne Griefe makes me rent my cloathes, &amp; I'l forhym in sackcloth mourne. Ruben Alas deare father what's the cause that you so sore lament? Iacob Here's Iosephs coate all blood: I feare he ys in peeces rent by some wild beast, for I hym sent to you a while agone &amp; tydings of hym synce that tyme as yet I do heare none sauinge that his coate by a stranger was to me deliuered who sayd he found the same wt h blood as you may see imbrued so that I thinke some sauage beast hath hym in peeces torne Ruben Doubtlesse then father he is well, where fore no longer mourne but rather ioy there at, &amp; your will vnto gods resigne who takes them first, whom he loues best, as often hath bene seene. Iudas Good father Rubens counsell follow, &amp; let your sorrow slake syth yt can not fetch hym agayne, but your tyme shorter make Levi &amp; reliqui fratres. The same aduise all we your sonnes father vnto you geue Iacob You may as well be sylent sonnes, for I'l no longer lyue syth Ioseph's dead, but mourninge to my sonne to hell descende: so let's go hence, for your persuations can not my griefe ende. putiphar Glaucus &amp; Balbo I perceiue that you both Ismaelits are &amp; to this land of Ãgypt come here for to sell your ware where of I will buy part, yf of the price we can agree Glaucus Both wee (my Lord) &amp; all our wares at your command shall bee take what you will, leaue what you list, the price shal be but reasonable &amp; yf you haue a lykeinge of this youth, he's also vendible. putiphar I am right glad there of, &amp; money for hym you shall haue for I his countenance lyke, yt is so sober, sage, &amp; graue. Tell me what you do value hym at, &amp; I will pay yt presently. Balbo There's no such hast (my Lord) but syth to hym you haue a fancy here take hym to your seruice now, &amp; when our other marchandize we to your Lordship bringe, of all together we'l sett the price. putiphar That me contents: fare well till then: come youth, wilt yu go wt h mee? Ioseph Wt h thanks my lord, for I am bound there to by loue &amp; duty. adew my frends wt h many thanks for your kynd vsage towards mee. Glaucus Ioseph fare well, a seruant thou wilt proue discreete &amp; trusty. Balbo let's now go hence vnto the court of my lord putiphar kinge pharaos Eunuche, &amp; prince of his army, there of our ware sale for to make, &amp; money receiue, as he hath vs appoynted Balbo Yt is our best, where fore begone, that we may get dispached putiphar. In happy tyme I entertayned Ioseph in my seruice syth all things prosper in his hands, for the lord wt h hym ys &amp; since his cominge to my house much bettered ys my case: my land's encreast, my wealth's farre more, then here to fore yt was. all wc h I for his sake acknowledge to haue hapt vnto mee. &amp; therefore steward of my house I haue made hym to bee. &amp; difference none betwixt vs put but the bread that I e[ate]. for except that, both wee feede of the self same kynd of meate so that in my sight he both hath, &amp; doth, &amp; shall fynde grace &amp; now to hym I will go backe agayne into my palace. Demetria Ioseph you see wee two are here to gether all alone &amp; to discouer what we shall say or do, here ys not one wherefore the secrets of my heart to you I will vnfold beinge glad to see you whom myne eyes desyre for to behold. The matter's this: yf you be pleas'd let vs two sleepe to gether. why speake you not? fayne would I heare a comfortable answeare.

Demetria The Hebrew would haue me abus'd, go streight &amp; call thy maister. my lord the Hebrew seruant whom you to our house dyd bringe vnto me came to haue deluded me, but preuayld nothinge &amp; when he heard me cry, he left his cloake, wc h I did hold. &amp; ranne away for very shame, wt h all the speede he could. Lo here's his cloake yet in my hands, wc h I dyd from hym take putiphar. Hath he abus'd you thus, &amp; I so much of hym dyd make? Demetria Vpon my knees my louinge lord wt h weepinge eyes I craue for his so foule, &amp; great abuse that iustice I may haue. putiphar. Lady you shall wt h all my heart, wherefore let vs be gone &amp; so soone as wee meete I'l clapp hym vp in ye kings prison. fernesus Ioseph the ruler of prince putiphars house is now committed to the kings prison where of I the keeper am apoynted &amp; he so well behaues hym self, that I haue made hym keeper of all the prisoners in the gaole, &amp; to hym did deliuer the keys when that I hither came wt h charge to looke vnto the prisoners as I my self before was wonte to do especially two' Eunuchs, th'one where of was ye chiefe cupbearer vnto the kinge my soueraigne lord, the other his chiefe Baker who are committed vnto prison, there for to be detayned till the offence layd to their charge hath throughly bene examined In the meane while they lykly are in prison to remayne for so the kinge commandment gaue, whither now I l go agayne Syphax Brabantio we to Ioseph are exceedinge much behouldinge who geues vs leaue to walke abroad &amp; take th'ayre not wt h standinge that we close prisoners should be kept, a fauour extraordinary though vsuall wt h hym he ys a man so full of pitty Brabantio. Syphax yt's true, where fore we'l his true prisoners remayne &amp; at the tyme by hym assignd returne to hym agayne. Syphax Else were yt pitty of our lyues, the while I will declare to you a troublesome dreame I had, wc h filles me full of care Brabantio. When you haue done I'l tell to you an other that I had wc h doth as strange vnto me seeme &amp; makes me toto sadd. But st our keeper Ioseph comes, let's heare what he will say. Ioseph How now my maisters what's the matter you are more sad today then you were wonte? Tell me th cause why yt ys wt h you thus. Syphax We had strange dreames, &amp; here's no body them to interpret to vs Ioseph Why doth not the interpretation belonge to god alone? Yet not wt h standinge there of make to me a short relation. But yours cupbearer first I am desyrous for to heare Syphax I verely thought I saw a vine, where in three branches were wc h first did budd, then blossom'd, &amp; lastly the grape rype waxed wc h I wronge into pharaos cup, &amp; yt to hym deliuered Ioseph The Dreame ys thus interpreted: Those same three branches signify that after three days thou vnto thy place restor'd shall bee, &amp; geue vnto the kinge his cup, as thou was vs'd to do: only remember then that mercy thou vnto me show, when that yt shall be well wt h thee, &amp; put pharao in mynde me to deliuer out of prison: Let me that frendship fynde, because I was taken by stealth out of the Hebrews country &amp; to this prison afterwards committed for myne innocency. Now maister Baker vnto me let your dreame be related. Brabantio. Wt h all my heart syth you so well my fellows haue interpreted Me thought three Baskets full of meale vpon my head I caryed &amp; in the high'st all kynd of meates were that could be deuysed by th'arte of Bakinge, &amp; that byrds out of the same dyd eate Ioseph. Well, listen to my wordes, for thus the dreame I do interprett: Those same three Baskets, iust three day yet for to come do signify after whose expiration pharao will thy head take from thee &amp; hange the on the crose: &amp; thy flesh shall foules of th'ayre teare The truth of wc h interpretations by th'euent shall appeare. In the meane while thinke as you list. So let's go back agayne as fellow prisoners at kings pleasure in prison to remayne. Syphax. Euen iust as Ioseph dyd foretell our dreames are come to passe for when that three days were expyr'd, the Baker hanged was &amp; I admitted to the place, where in before I serued &amp; at feast on the kings byrth day his cup to hym deliuered And since that tyme the kinge hym self two seuerall dreames hath had wc h so perplext hym that all the Interpreters he bade &amp; wyse men in his land should be sent for, but none was found that could interpret them, wc h to their shame did much redound But at the length (for I'l confesse my synne) I dyd remember (though after two yeares space) the Hebrew that was fellow prisoner wt h me, &amp; wt h the baker, who to vs our dreames interpreted most truly, as by the euent was playnly after proued &amp; I haue made the kinge acquainted wt h this yonge mans cunninge in th'expoundinge of dreames, by whose commaundment I am goinge hym out of prison for to fetch, &amp; bringe hym to his maiesty in th'expositions of hys dreames his cunninge for to try &amp; I doubt not but by this act both the kinge to content &amp; also for to gett this man relea'st of his imprisonment wc h yf I do, no man a lyue shall gladder be then I &amp; now in hope there of I will go fetch hym to his maiesty My liege th'Interpreter of dreames ys now in presence here Kinge Pharao. I am no litle glad there of. My pritty youth come neere. Ioseph I had two seuerall dreames, &amp; not one can be found wt h in this land of Ãgypt that's able them to expound. But I informed am that thou canst them interpret wysely Ioseph Wt h out me god shall answeare prosperous things to pharaos maiesty Kinge pharao I verely thought that I did stand on the banke of a Riuer &amp; out of yt came vp seauen fayre fatt kyne one after other wc h in greene marish places fedd. &amp; after these there followed other seauen kyne, wc h were both leane &amp; passinge euill fauoured Lyke vnto wc h I in the Land of Ãgypt had seene neuer &amp; they the former did deuour, &amp; yet were neuer fuller. but very leane &amp; toto foule, &amp; looked passinge heauely: wt h wc h I wak't, but slept agayne: And then thought I did see seauen eares of corne very fayre &amp; full vpon one stalke to grow. other seauen thinne, &amp; blasted wt h adustian then I saw springe also of the self same stalke, wc h did deuour the former. Of these two dreames I shall be glad to fynd a true interpreter Ioseph These two do but one thinge import, for god hath shew'd to pharao what by his speciall prouidence he intendeth for to do. The seauen fatt kyne, &amp; seauen eares of corne so fayre &amp; full vndoubtedly betoken seauen yeares that shall be plentifull. And the seauen leane kyne &amp; the seauen thynne &amp; blasted eares of corne, that came vp after th'other, betoken seauen yeares of famyne yet to come, &amp; that in this ensuinge order as these two dreames do signify, importinge both one matter. First in the land of Ãgypt shall seauen yeares be of fertility after the wc h shall follow other seauen yeares of great sterility So that the plenty of the former years shall be forgotten before th'ende of the seauen future yeares that shall be barren for the sterility shall destroy the greatnes of the plenty so that a generall famyne there shall be through all the country. And syth that both your dreames were to the self same thinge pertayninge yt argues that vndoubtedly to passe god will yt bringe. Now therefore let the kinge some wyse industrious man provide that will &amp; can the land of Ãgypt rule, gouerne, &amp; guyde that ouer seers he may appoynt ouer all the whole country fifth part of the fruits of the earth into their barnes to cary while the seauen yeares of plenty last, wc h forthwt h are ensuinge &amp; there to store yt vp vnder the hands of pharao kinge agaynst the seauen yeares that after shall ensue of scarcity by that meanes Ãgypt shall wt h famyne not consumed bee. Kinge pharao Thy counsell Ioseph's tooto good, &amp; pleaseth me right well multitude of the Ãgyptians And so yt doth vs all both great &amp; smale, the truth to tell. Kinge pharao can we fynd such another man that's wt h gods spirit replenished Ioseph syth god all yt thou spoken hast, to thee hath shewed Thou shalt be ruler of my house, &amp; euery one shall bee at thy command: But only in the throne I'l be before thee. And I do make the ouer seer of all th'Ãgyptian land &amp; from myne owne hand take this ringe, &amp; gyue yt to thy hand. &amp; thee adorne wt h this silke robe, &amp; put this chayne of gold about thy necke. &amp; yt my pleasure ys that ech one should bowe downe their knees to thee, &amp; knoledge take that I haue made the gouernour of the land of Ãgypt, as before I sayd. I pharao am, &amp; no man in all the Ãgyptian land wt h outen thy commandment shall moue eyther foote or hand Saphnath pahanaach shall thy name here after called bee wc h in th'Ãgyptian tongue the sauiour of the world doth signify But a secret &amp; hidden thinge in hebrew yt importeth, &amp; by the Rabins ys expund'd, one that secrets reuealeth. And in my second chariot thou shalt ryde duringe thy lyfe And Asseneth more ouer I will geue the to thy wyfe, who daughter ys to putiphar priest &amp; prince of Heliopolis Ioseph None more my liege then I vnto your grace behouldinge ys &amp; for these honours wc h you haue, &amp; will of me bestow my seruice shall at your commandment be most worthy pharao. And syth the yeares of plenty now are cominge on a pase I'l go about the charge I haue, yf yt shall please your grace Kinge pharao What lyketh thee shall me content, so great thy wisdome ys Now let's be gone, &amp; in all things I'l keepe wt h thee my promyse [Chorus] You must imagin now that vnto Aseneth Ioseph's maryed &amp; that he perfectly the land of Ãgypt hath surueyed &amp; all the barnes fild full of corne in these seaue years of plenty wc h are already come &amp; gone, where in was such fertility. that all the Barns could not contayne the grayne yt was preserued but euery Towne, &amp; euery citty there wt h was also filled. &amp; there was such great store of wheate as could not measured bee, but numberlesse lyke the sea sand yt euerywhere dyd lye. And in this tyme two sonnes were borne to Ioseph: th'one Manasses Th'other Ephraim cald. And now this seauen years beinge gone of fruitfulnes other seauen yeares of scarcity began, as Ioseph sayd So that through the whole world both a great dearth &amp; famyne's made saueinge that in the land of Ãgypt there's of corne great plenty: &amp; when the people hunger staru'd of pharao call &amp; cry desyringe foode, forth wt h he byds them vnto Ioseph go, &amp; do in all respects as he shall them aduyse to do. And dayly more, &amp; more the famyne through all the land encreaseth So that he hath open'd all the Barnes, &amp; to th'Ãgyptians selleth: for them also the famyne hath opprest: &amp; all other countries to Ãgypt come for to buy corne for to relyue their miseries. But what effect this famyne will cause, at length yt will be knowne wherefore a whyle attentyue be, &amp; so I will be gone. Iacob You see sonnes that here in chanaan of corne there ys great scarcity &amp; in the land of Ãgypt as you heare there ys greate plenty. Why then neglect you tyme, &amp; do not to that country go some kynde of grayne to buy, as others of your neighbours do? Will you both famish't be yourselues, &amp; suffer me to dye for want of foode? Sonnes do not so, but thither make a iourney all ten to gether, &amp; you shall haue of me both gold &amp; syluer to buy corne wt h, &amp; horses also to bringe yt from thence hither. And Beniamin till your returne wt h me at home shall stay lest he perhaps beinge yonge &amp; weake should take harme by the way. Ruben Father we will at your command that iourney vnder take Iacob. Then forthwt h let's be gone all thinges in readynes to make. Ruben Now are we vnto Ãgypt come, &amp; nigh to the kings palace we haue our lodginges taken vp in a convenient place where we our sackes &amp; horses lefte &amp; come to seeke the Ruler of this land, who sels all the corne: &amp; lo he's now cominge hither God saue your honour worthy Syr, we prostrate here do craue that some corne for our money yt would please you to let vs haue Ioseph I know these are my Brethren, yet I will speake somewhat roughly to them as though I knew them not, syth none of them do know mee. What country men are you that come in such a troupe together? Simeon We of chanaan are, &amp; for to buy corne be come hither. Ioseph Nay you are spyes, &amp; come to vewe the weake parts of the country Leui Not so my lord, but we thy seruants are come grayne to buy We are the sonnes all of one man, &amp; come as men of peace &amp; wish no hurt vnto this land, but pray god yt to blesse. Ioseph No you come th'vndefenced parts of this land to consider Iuda We were twelue Breethren all the sonnes of one man, &amp; our father in the land of chanaan dwells, wt h whom the yong'st ys lyuinge, an other's dead, &amp; we ten are the rest that be remayninge Ioseph T'ys yt that made me call you spyes: &amp; now the truth Il try for by the health of pharao you shall not depart from mee vntill your yongest brother come, but here remayne in prison all saueinge one who shall hym fetch, let therefore one be gone els by the health of pharao I shal thinke that spyes you bee But ere that one go you all shall three dayes in prison lye. Wherefore content your selues, &amp; now to prison wt h me go. Isachar My lord we are at your command syth that yt must needes be so. Ioseph Now haue you three days prisoners bene, do as I haue you bydden &amp; you shall lyue, for I feare god. Let but one of your Brethren (Yf you be men of peace) be bound in prison, &amp; all the other go &amp; cary the corne that you shall buy (as you thought for to do) vnto your houses, &amp; then bringe your yongest Brother to mee that I may proue your speeches to be true, lest that you dye. Ruben Wt h all our hearts we are content: take wc h of vs you will &amp; wt h you keepe hym for a pawne till wee your mynd fullfill Ioseph Then Simeon shall be the man that shall your suerty bee Here Doilus bynd hym fast: So now cary hym to prison presently Iuda Now worthely these things we suffer because that we haue synned agaynst our Brother, who pitti'd hym not, when as he vs intreated &amp; for this cause vpon vs ys this tribulation fallen Ruben why were not you to synne agaynst the boy by me forbydden &amp; to my wordes you gaue no eare. of vs his bloodes required Ioseph They thinke I vnderstand them not: but much they are deceiued &amp; for to heare their dolefull mone yt pittieth me no litle, &amp; maketh salt teares from myne eyes lyke hayle stones for to tricle. Though from ther sight I them do hyde by turninge of my backe So now I'l go &amp; let them haue as much corne as they lacke. Now at your pleasure go good fellows, &amp; make your Asses ready &amp; sacks, &amp; to my barnes repayre, &amp; take what you thinke necessary for your reliefe, after the rate, that other men do pay omnes fratres. Wee thanke your honour, &amp; take our leaue of you for whom we'l pray [Ioseph] Arbastus see their sacks fild full of wheate, &amp; ech mans money agayne in their owne sacks see that thou put wt h out their priuity &amp; besyds that them some thinge geue for to eate by the way Arbastus. My lord this your commandment shall be doone wt h out delay Ioseph Wt h heauy hearts, &amp; troubled mynds now are my brothers gone I know right well, yet I yt suffer to bringe them to contrition wt h out the wc h though iniuries by men may be remitted yet the offenders neuer can before god be absolued wherefore out of my loue to them, (though I their synne detest) this I haue done, thereby to breede repentance in their brest wc h before absolution of our synnes must euer go wc h to procure I was to them thus sharpe in outward show: for no cause else, as god (who sees the secrett of my heart) can tell. But now I must uppon occasion hence depart. Iacob Sonnes I am glad you are come home &amp; that wt h full fild sacks of excellent wheate, but one thinge yet me much amazed makes &amp; that ys this, that all your money was in your sacke topps found as I perceiu'd when you pour'd out your wheate vpon the ground But much more I astonyed am, &amp; troubled in my mynde that you are all come home agayne, &amp; lefte Simeon behynd &amp; that in prison, yea &amp; fast bound in chaynes, for so you say, &amp; (wc h doth greeue most) will now take Beniamin away. &amp; (as you know) Ioseph is dead, so that yf you hould on the course you haue begun, children shortly I shall haue none. woe's me what shall I do, when all these euills are fallen on mee! Ruben Kill my two sonnes yf Beniamin I bringe not backe in safty vnto you father yf you will hym to my hands committ. Iacob No Ruben, no, content thy self, in no case I will do yt. His brother Ioseph's dead, &amp; he remayninge ys alone yf in the way yll hym befall, (as surety there ys none you shall bringe downe my hoary heyres wt h sorrow vnto hell come let's away: of my sonnes goinge no more I will heare tell. My sonnes you see that all the grayne you brought ys almost spent wherefore to Ãgypt go agayne to buy some more incontinent. Iuda The ouer seer of the land of whom you heard before protested wt h an oath, that we his fayth should see no more vnlesse that we did wt h vs bringe to hym our yongest brother wherefore wt h vs yf you'l hym send, we will agayne go thither &amp; buy what you do lack: but yf you will not, we'l not go for he'l not on vs looke, except he see our brother also Iacob you haue done this t'augment my griefe. In that you did hym tell you had an other brother, assure your selues you dyd not well Leui The man did aske vs of our progeny: first yf our father lyued, then what children he had: vnto wc h we directly answeared could we beforehand father tell that he would vs command our brother for to bringe? Knew we that he would this demand? Sende the boy wt h me that vpon our iourney we may go, &amp; lyue, lest that we &amp; our litle ones dye. Good father do so. I'l take vpon me his protection: require hym at my hand. vnlesse I bringe hym saffe agayne to you from Ãgypt land I'l guilty be of synne for euermore agaynst you father. But for delay the second tyme ere now we had come hither Iacob. Yf yt must needs be so, do as you lyst: I am content but cary to the man to whom you go, from me a present of all the best fruits of this land, a curtesy of hony Rosen, Incense, Almonds, Terebynth, &amp; myrrh, &amp; double money that you may haue enough, both for to pay for the new corne you buy, &amp; the money that was in your sacks backe to returne. Lest peraduenture yt was done, through ouersight or errour. And wt h you also take litle Beniamin your yonger brother &amp; go vnto the man: And my god that's almighty make hym vpon you, both pitty &amp; compassion for to take. &amp; to send backe wt h you your brother whom he doth keepe in prison &amp; Beniamin. How desolate shall I be here lefte alone? Iudas So soone as he hath seene this boy (father) he'l let's returne wt h hym, Simeon, &amp; corne: wherefore I pray you do not mourne. Iacob God graunt my sonne yt fall out so. But now let's hence be gone of all things needfull for your iourney for to make preparation. [Ioseph] I see the men that lately went to the land of chanaan are wt h their yongest brother come to buy more corne agayne Arbastus go &amp; fetch them to my house, &amp; victimes kill &amp; make a feast, for haue them dyne wt h me at Noone I will. In the meane tyme I'l go about such busines as I haue Arbastus Wt h care my Lord all shall be done, as you commandment gaue. My frends yt's my lords will that you into his house shall go why stand you there lyke men amaz'd? come, come, yt must be so. Ruben. Oh Brothers we must in be brought I feare about the money wc h we at our first cominge hither backe in our sackes dyd cary that a false accusation hee agaynst vs there might lay that he may vs in bondage keepe, &amp; all our Asses stay. Iudas. Good maister steward we humbly beseech you vs to heare. Once before this to buy prouision we in this country were &amp; comminge home, in our sack topps we found iust so much money as our corne cost, wc h we haue brought agayne, beinge no way priuy who put yt there: &amp; besyds that more money wt h vs bringe to pay for that we take, for we would you offend in nothinge Arbastus Peace be wt h you: feare not: your god, &amp; the god of your father gaue you that treasure in your sacks: wherefore let that thinge neuer dismay you frends: for I acknowledge that I was truly payed for all the corne that then you bought: wherefore be not dismayed but come in to the house, &amp; I will bringe your brother Simeon vnto you thither, whom you at your departure lefte in prison and for your feete you shall haue water &amp; for your asses prouender omnes fratres. We thanke you maister steward, &amp; kyndly do accept your offer. Ruben. My lord (yf we might be so bold) to you we would present the token wc h your honour sawe, from our old father sent. Ioseph I kyndly yt accept, &amp; vnto hym am much behouldinge. ys the old man your father in good health? ys he yet lyuinge? Ruben your seruant our old father ys in health, &amp; lyueth still. &amp; his yong'st sonne by vs hath sent, accordinge to your will Ioseph Ys this same your yonge brother of whome to me you made relation? Iuda Yt ys (my lord) Ios[eph]. God vnto the be mercifull my sonne. From weepinge I can not refrayne to see this myne owne brother yonge Beniamin, who wt h me had one &amp; the selfsame mother, so great ioy ouerwhelmes my heart. wherefore I'l take occasion for to retyre my self till I haue dryue away this passion. Arbastus bringe them after me to eate wt h me to day Arbastus. I will my lord. come wt h me frends: you heare what he dyd say. my lord hath caused all these men to sitt wt h hym at dynner where they accordinge to their age were placed all in order but by hym self my lord dyd sitt: These men apart were placed from hym: &amp; so th Ãgyptians also were that wt h them dyned for for th'Ãgyptians yt's vnlawfull &amp; prophane to eate wt h th'Hebrews: &amp; my lord at dynner a portion gaue of meate to euery one: But Beniamins by fyue parts was the best because (as yt should seeme) he lou'd hym farre aboue the reste When dynner was done forthwt h my lord commandment gaue I should fill all the strangers sacks wt h corne as much as they could hould &amp; in the top of ech mans sacke to put agayne their money &amp; in the yongest brothers sack he also dyd command mee to put his syluer cupp where in to drynke he vsed was all wc h I dyd vnknowne to them, &amp; they away did passe. But now my lord comes here yt seems yt he would some thinge wt h me Ioseph Arbastus go, pursue the men that are vpon their iourney &amp; when thou ouertak'st them say: why haue you euill rendred for good? The cup wc h you haue stollen, vnto my Lord belonged &amp; ys that where in he doth drinke, &amp; where in he doth vse for to diuine. You ill haue done hym thus for to abuse. And there vpon search all theyr sacks begininge wt h the eldest &amp; so proceede from on t'another till thou come to the yongest where fyndinge yt, bringe them all backe agayne forthwt h vnto mee Arbastus Euen as your Lordship hath comand'd all shall performed bee Ioseph Well then make hast.

The cup, wc h you haue stollen vnto my lord belonged, &amp; ys that where in he doth drynke, &amp; where in he doth vse for to diuine: you ill haue done hym thus for to abuse. Ruben Why doth our lord speake to vs so? as though thy seruants had some heynous &amp; enormious fault agaynst your honour made The money that before we found in our sacke topps, agayne we to your Lordship dyd recary from the Land of chanaan How should we then haue stollen out of thy lords house gold &amp; syluer?

Knew you not that none's lyke to me in the art of diuininge? Iuda. What answeare shall we make my lord? or what shall we be able for an excuse for to pretend syth god hath found vs culpable? Lo we are bound men to my lord ech one, both he, &amp; wee wt h whom the cupp was found, &amp; yeelde ourselues vnto your mercy Ioseph Nay god forbyd I should so do.

Iuda I humbly you beseech my Lord, let me but speake one worde wt h out offence syth that you after pharao are my lord: At first tyme you vs askt: Haue you a father or a brother? &amp; we dyd answeare make vnto my lord: we haue a father, Who aged ys, &amp; a yonge brother in his old age begot, Whose brother by the mother ys dead, &amp; any mo sonnes she hath not &amp; that yonge sonne ys tenderly beloued of hys father. And you vnto your seruants sayd: Bringe hym vnto me hither that I may sett myne eyes on hym. we to my lord suggested yf that the boy his father leaue, he quickly will be dead. And you vnto your seruants sayd: vnlesse your yongest brother you vnto me do bringe, my face agayne you shall see neuer. All wc h we to our father told: who bad vs agayne go when all the corne we bought was spent. where to we answeared, No except the boy he sent wt h vs: &amp; told hym the cause why where to he answeare made: you know that my wyfe two sonnes bare me where of the one went forth, &amp; you dyd say he was deuoured by some wild beast: &amp; to this day he neuer yet appeared: yf this you also take, &amp; ought do hym befall but well you shall bringe downe my hoary heyres wt h sorrow vnto hell. Wherefore yf that vnto your seruant our father I shall go wt h out the boy, on whose lyfe his lyfe hangs, he'l dye for wo Let me there fore your boundman be, who tooke hym to my custody eyther to bringe hym saffe agayne, or of synne to be guylty. agaynst my father.

But ere you go lett [me] my Brother Beniamin embrace To see thee Brother I am the gladdest man that euer was.

Kinge pharao. Ioseph I am informed that these here thy brethren are &amp; I &amp; all my house are glad to heare &amp; see their welfare Welcome to me my frends for Iosephs sake to Ãgypt land &amp; what so euer ys there in shall be at your command. And Ioseph byd them loadinge take, &amp; go vnto their father &amp; hym &amp; all his kynne thence bringe, &amp; come vnto thee hither that all the good thinges in this land on them thou may bestow that of the land of Ãgypt they &amp; theirs may eate the marrow. Commandment also geue that waynes they also wt h them cary for cariage of their litle ones, their wyues, &amp; their whole family. &amp; byd them nothinge leaue behynd, but returne wt h all speede &amp; all the wealth of Ãgypt's theirs to serue them yf they neede. &amp; so adew till your returne, wc h I wish should be shortly Omnes fratres. All happines renowned pharao attend your royall maiestye. Ioseph Well Brothers now you shall be gone, &amp; as the kinge commanded Waynes, corne, &amp; victualls for the way for you I'l see prouided Arbastus go &amp; for ech one of them two robes make ready, but fyue for Beniamin; and of the best see that they bee. Three hundred peeces also geue to Beniamin of syluer. &amp; by them as much money &amp; rayment send vnto my father: &amp; asses lett them also haue their ryches for to cary &amp; for to beare their wheate, &amp; all their victualls for their iourney. And Brothers by the way see that among'st you be no anger but louingly agree, as Brothers ought one wt h an other as I do hope you will. So let's be gone to make thinges ready Omnes fratres Vpon your honour we'l attend, as we are bound by duty Iacob I thinke ech day a yeare to be synce my sonnes hence departed &amp; musen much they do not come, for now the tyme's expyred of their appoyntment to returne. God graunt they be in safty &amp; not detayn'd agaynst their wills, but haue their wonted liberty to come &amp; that at their owne tyme, where of I stand in feare that all this whyle no tydings I at all do from them heare. Here of I dream'd before they went, &amp; therefore would haue stayed my yonge sonne Beniamyn at home, because I was afray'd lest I should neuer see hym more, yf he dyd wt h them go &amp; yet his Brethren me persua'd I had no cause to thinke so: such was their found security. But ouer late I fynde to my great griefe they were deceiu'd, &amp; in their iudgment blinde. Wt h the vntymely death of Ioseph they were not contented vntill that mee of Beniamyn they also had bereaued. who in myne old age might haue beene to me a help &amp; stay where as for want of him wt h sorrow I shall now pyne away. for fully I persuaded am some euill's to them happened or by all lyklyhood they neuer would thus longe haue stayed. But I shall not depryued be only of my sonne Beniamyn &amp; them, But I &amp; all their children shall also dye of famyne, wc h grows so great in euery place, that victualls for no money there's any where for to be bought saueinge in Ãgypt only where all my sonnes miscaried haue, &amp; will no more returne. No other course then can I take, but here sitt downe &amp; mourne Ruben Rest you well (father) what's the cause that you sitt here so sadly? Iacob Molest me not, who s'euer you be, for I am full of misery Iudas Wee are your sonnes from Ãgypt come, who craue your blessing father Jacob My sonnes are dead I know right well, wherefore mock me no longer Beniamyn Good father say not so, but speake to me your yong'st sonne Beniamyn. Iacob That voyce reuyues my spirits, &amp; makes me to cast vp myne eyne Wh'are you that neele before me here? My sonnes? I would you were. but both myne eye sight &amp; myne eares do me deceiue I feare. omnes fratres. we are your sonnes, &amp; craue your blessinge, beinge glad to see you well. Iacob. Are you my sonnes all saffe come home? my ioy no tongue can tell. God blesse you all. come Beniamin, &amp; let me the embrace. Kisse me my sonne. How doth my boy? for feare half dead I was lest I should haue seene you no more. Blessed be god Almighty who in your iourney was your guyd, &amp; brought you saffe vnto mee Ruben For that we'l euer prayse his name: &amp; let you understande that Ioseph yet ys lyuinge, &amp; rules all the Ãgyptian land Iacob Me thinkes I as yt were out of a heauy sleepe am wakened. Ioseph my sonne yet lyuinge? yt ys a thinge not to be credited &amp; much lesse that he ruler ys of all the land of Ãgypt Beniamyn. Father the one as well as th'others true vpon my credit Iacob. That's neyther: for Ioseph was by some naughty beast deuored longesynce. How can he then be lyuinge, or Ãgypt by hym gouered? Iudas Father we saw hym wt h our eyes, &amp; heard hym wt h our eares: &amp; he confirm'd the same, by sheedinge of whole floodes of teares for ioy to see vs there: &amp; asked kyndly how you dyd &amp; when we were to come away did vs command &amp; bidd to bringe you to hym wt h vs thither, wt h your whole house &amp; family &amp; store of waynes hath wt h vs sent your substance for to cary, &amp; asses load wt h wheate, &amp; money put into our purses where wt h for to defray by the way all our costs &amp; charges &amp; vpon vs two roabes a peece he also hath bestowed but fyue on Beniamin for hym yt seemes he most affected &amp; vnto hym three hundred peeces he also gaue of syluer &amp; as many mo he sent to you by Beniamin our Brother &amp; rayment also for to weare to you he sent lyke wyse all wc h may be sufficient proofe, that he our brother ys. And to all this kinge pharao gaue consent, &amp; did command that we should go &amp; yt relate vnto you out of hand Iacob Yf my sonne Ioseph yet be lyuinge, fully yt me suffyceth &amp; I resolued am to go &amp; see hym ere my death where fore let's go &amp; ready make all things fitt for our iourney Ruben father we'l all attend on you as we are bound in duty. Iacob Now I am towards Ãgypt goinge wt h my whole house &amp; family &amp; by the well of th'oath I victims kild to god almig[h]ty the god of myne owne father Isaac, &amp; neere vnto that place I leaft my company, &amp; came hither to rest me here a space God. Iacob, Iacob? Iac[ob]. Lo here I am. God. I am the god most mighty of thy father, feare not, but downe to Ãgypt go directly. And there into a great &amp; mighty nation I will make thee: &amp; I will go downe wt h thee thither, &amp; thence returninge bringe thee. Iacob. It seemes I slept, &amp; haue heard god speake to me in a vision wherefore (as he me bade) I towards Ãgypt will be gone &amp; will before me Iudas send to Ioseph for to signify that I am cominge, &amp; hym desyre in Gessen for to meete mee Iudas. Father this is the place, yf that I take my ayme aright where Ioseph dyd appoynt to meete, &amp; now hee's here in sight Ioseph Your blessinge father I desyre. Iac[ob]. God's blessinge haue thou Ioseph yf thou be lyuinge &amp; in health my sonne yt mee sufficeth. Now Ioseph will I dye wt h ioy syth I haue seene thy face. Ioseph Let me clipp you about the neck, &amp; in myne armes embrace. I can not choose but weepe for ioy when that I see you father Iacob. No more can I to see the soone, whom I haue loued euer Ioseph Father welcome: so be you Brothers. I'l go vnto the kinge &amp; hym acquaynt, wt h yours, my fathers, &amp; his families cominge &amp; that you pastors are of sheepe, &amp; flocks to feede's your trade &amp; that your heardes, &amp; all you haue are come, as hym selfe bade. And when he askes you, what's your trade, you shall geue hym these answears Wee from our youth haue pastors bene, &amp; so were our fore fathers: that in the land of Gessen you may dwell, thus you must say because wt h no pastors of sheepe th'Ãgyptians can away. Till my returne here stay, for wt h all speede I'l come agayne Iacob. Sonne thy directions wee'l obserue, &amp; here the whyle remayne. Sonnes see how god prouids for vs beyonde our expectation by bringeinge vs in tyme of famyne vnto a fruitfull nation where by he bynds vs more &amp; more thankfull to hym to bee. But 'st, the kinge ys here at hand: Let vs attend his maiesty Kinge pharao. Ioseph I am right glad your father's come &amp; all his ch[i]ldren &amp; ys as you affirm aryu'd here in the land of Gessen Ioseph They are my liege: Loe where they be, as to your grace I sayde Kinge pharao. Welcome my frendes to Ãgypt land. I pray you what's your trade Iacob Thy seruantes pastors are of sheepe, as our fore fathers were, &amp; come to soiourne in this land, by reason that we heare there's plenty of corne in this country, &amp; also store of grasse where as in the land whence we came great want of both there was where fore most humbly we beseech your grace to graunt vs liberty here in the land of Gessen for to stay wt h all our company Kinge pharao. Ioseph thy father &amp; thy Brethren are hither come vnto thee. The Land of Ãgypt's in thy sight, the best part of the country see that thou place them in, &amp; Gessen vnto them deliuer. If any industrious men amongst them thou doest know come hither appoynt them maisters of my cattle. But now thy father shew mee Ioseph This aged man (my Liege) whom here I bringe vnto your maiesty Kinge pharao. God blesse you (father) tell me what's the number of your yeares. Iacob One hundred thirty, few &amp; euill, &amp; reach not to my fathers Kinge pharao Yt's a fayre age. Now I'l be gone, &amp; leaue you wt h your sonne. Iacob All happines attend your honour, &amp; gods good benediction Ioseph Now father I'l go &amp; deliuer vnto you out of hand possession of the fruitfulst place, that's wt h in all this land: &amp; for provision of your house you shall haue store of grayne &amp; for your catle foode enough whyle the famyne doth remayne. Iacob Thankes my beloued sonne. I see thy dreame's now come to passe &amp; thankes to god I geue, who me conducted to this place. where in this tyme of famyne I, &amp; my whole house may haue reliefe. No doubt but god thee hither sent our soules to saue. Ioseph Hee did in deede: for wc h let's prayse his name for euermore &amp; now be gone. Iac[ob]. Sonne lead the way. Ios[eph]. No you shall go before Iac[ob]. That ys not seemely sonne. Ios[eph]. perhaps as I am vnder pharao. but as I am your sonne yt's fitt that you before should go. Wherefore good father lead the way, &amp; I wt h all my brethren will follow you &amp; be your guyde vnto the land of Gessen. Arbastus. My Lord the famyne ys so great through all the world encreased though most in Ãgypt &amp; chanaan that they are almost famished. And the Ãgyptians still cry out for corne, but haue no money to pay for yt: for as you know, yt's all in the kings treasury Ioseph Then let them to me bringe their catle, as horses sheepe, &amp; oxen for wc h they shall haue corne for to relieue them &amp; their children. And let them not thinke much there at, for I must be indifferent betwixt the kinge &amp; them, as I am bound by gods commandment wherefore as I let them haue corne, wc h ys my lords the kinges, Euen so must I receiue for yt eyther coyne, or other thinges that's answearable there vnto: exceptinge when his maiesty will yt gratis bestow on any, out of his liberality And they at their owne seruantes hands will looke for ye lyke iustice: wherefore they can not blame me yf I do the kinge lyke seruice. But now vnto the common barns let's go corne to deliuer for many Buyers longe ere this doubtlesse will be come thither. Bletzo. What Neighbour Turnsol shall we do, now all our money's gone &amp; all our catle chang'd for corne, &amp; yet corne haue wee none? &amp; this ys our whole countries case, wherefore let's haue your counsell Turnsol. Oh Neighbour Bletzo lyfe ys sweete, wc h to preserue lets sell our Lands vnto the kinge, &amp; our selues his Boundslaues become So may we lyue: all though our lyues will paynfull be &amp; troublesome. Bletzo Your counsell's good, though somewhat sharpe: &amp; yet all Ãgypt land are forc't before vs so to do, as I do vnnderstande Turnsol Then must we needes the same course take, syth yt we can not remedy &amp; wt h them be content to make a vertue of necessity wherefore let vs repayre vnto the ruler of this land &amp; bargayne wt h hym for some corne: who now ys here at hand God saue your honour noble lord. Your suppliants humbly craue that corne for saue guard of their lyues at your hand they may haue. in liew where of you for the kinge of our lands, may make seysure &amp; we our selues will bound men be also vnto his honour Ioseph. My lord the kinge ys mercifull &amp; wisheth no mans ouerthrow &amp; looke what fauour other found the lyke he'l to you show where fore you shall haue foode to eate, &amp; may your land go till &amp; fetch here seede to sow yt wt h. &amp; of th'encrease I will haue you one fifth part for to geue only vnto his maiesty &amp; foure take to your selues for seede, &amp; to relieue your family &amp; here wt h not you only but all Ãgypt ys content because you &amp; your lands are now the kings by your consent Bletzo Our lyues are in your hands, &amp; yf our lord to vs shew mercy we will be ready for to serue the kinge &amp; that most gladly Ioseph Well then Arbastus go, &amp; let corne be to them deliuered as vnto all the rest, so that these couenants be obserued. Arbastus. All shall my lord performed be as you commandment geue Turnsol. And we'l (my lord) acknowled you to be the cause we lyue. Ioseph. Now all the land of Ãgypt but the priests (who are made free from these conditions) to the kinge must one fifth part pay yearly &amp; thinke them selue well delt wt h all for they a sale dyd make of all their lands, &amp; yet the kinge one fifth part doth but take. And but that they thus do, they would be starued all wt h hunger, where-as now they may lyue. But now I'l go &amp; see my father who aged growes, &amp; syckly to for so I am informed by one who also sayd that he to see me much desyred Iacob Sonne Ioseph I do feele that the day of my death draws nigh where fore yf I haue found grace in thy sight, vnder my thigh put thy hand, &amp; thou shalt vnto me do thys truth &amp; mercy not in the land of Ãgypt, but wt h my forefathers bury me Ioseph Father assure your self I'l do euen as you haue commanded Iacob. Sweare then vnto me sonne. Ios[eph]. As I lyue there you shall be buryed Iacob. In Luza wc h ys in chanaan god dyd appeare vnto mee &amp; blest me sayinge: I'l into multituds of peoples make thee &amp; geue to thee, &amp; after thee, vnto thy seede this land. but sonne tell me who those two be, that there by the do stand Ioseph. They are my sonns, &amp; called be Manasses &amp; Ephraim, whom god vpon me hath bestowed since to this place I came. Iacob I knew them not my sight's so dimme. Good sonne bringe them vnto me, that I my blessinge may on them bestow before I dye. Welcome sweete sonnes: let me you kisse &amp; in myne armes embrace you shall reputed be to me as Simeon &amp; Ruben was. Sonne Ioseph of the sight of thee I haue not bene defrauded &amp; god almighty also hath thy seede vnto me shewed. Ioseph Father lett me take from your lapp my sonns that they may stand to take your blessinge th'one on your left, the other on your right hand Iacob So do my sonne that I my hands vpon their heads may lay God in whose sight my fathers Abraham &amp; Isaac ay did walke: God that me from my youth foode till this day hath geuen, Th'Angell, that me deliuered hath from all ylls, blesse these children. And be myne, &amp; my fathers names vpon them called also, &amp; into a great multitude vpon th'earth let them grow Ioseph Vpon his right hand purposely I plac'd the elder Brother Manasses, &amp; vpon his lefte Ephraim, who ys the yonger thinkeinge he would haue layd his hands vpon them as they stand. but changeinge them he puts his lefte in place of his right hand crosewyse, where at I musen much, &amp; yt no litle greeues mee. But he perhaps mistakes, wherefore his hands I'l remoue presently. Father yt's not convenient so to bee, wherefore I pray you on Manasses head, who's first begotten, your right hand lay. Iacob. No, no, I know (my sonne) I know: Manasses shall in deede into a mighty people grow, &amp; shall be multiplyed: But yet his yonger Brother shall be greatter farre then hee, &amp; into Nations shall his seede encrease &amp; multiply. Nephewes) God blesse you both. In thee sonne shall Israel be blessed. Ephraim stand there, for thou before Manasses shall be placed. Ioseph my sonne behold I dye, &amp; god wt h you will bee &amp; you agayne backe to the land of your forefathers cary. And vnto thee aboue thy Brethren one portion geue I do wc h from th'Amorrhean I did take wt h my sword &amp; my bow. But now thy Brethren cominge are. Sonnes stand there all together that I may shew to you the things, that are to come here after. Ruben my first begotten, my strength, &amp; of my griefes beginner, former in giftes, in Empyre greatter, thou art pour'd out as water, Encrease thou not, because thou did'st ascend thy fathers bedd. Simeon &amp; Leui Brethren of the self same woman bredd come not my soule vnto their counsell warringe vessells of iniquity, nor in their congregation be my glory, syth in their fury they slew a man, &amp; a wall vndermyned in their wilfulnes In Iacob I'l diuide them, &amp; in Israel them disperse. Iudas thy children shall the prayse: In the necke of thyne enemy thy hand shall be, yea &amp; thy fathers children shall adore thee. To the pray sonne thou did'st ascend, a Lions whelp Iudas takeinge thy rest thou as a Lyon lye, &amp; as a Lyonesse. who shall thee rayse? The scepter shall from Iudas not be taken: A Duke out of his thigh, vntill he come &amp; be vp rysen that's to be sent, who th'Expectation of the Gentills shall bee &amp; his colt to the vinyard, &amp; shee Asse to the vine shall tye: &amp; he shall wash his stole in wyne, &amp; cloake in blood of grapes Zabulon shall in the sea shoare dwell, &amp; in the roade of shipps. Isachar a stronge Asse shall at rest betweene the borders lye: he saw that rest was good, &amp; shoulder vnder put to cary. Dan shall his people iudge, as an other tribe in Israel be Dan a snake in the way, in the path a serpent fell bytinge the horses hoofes that his ryder may backward fall I'l thy saluation (lord) expect, wc h come here after shall. Gad the girded shall before hym fight, &amp; backward bee girded hym self. Aser his bread ys fatt, &amp; daynties hee shall geue to kings. And Nepthali a hart let forth &amp; geuinge speeches of beauty. And Ioseph my sonne a child encreasinge, encreasinge, &amp; comly for to behold; The Daughters coursed both to &amp; fro vpon the wall: but the dart men hym enuyed, his bow sate on the stronge, Band of his armes &amp; hands were loosed by the hands of the mighty of Iacob: from thence issued a pastor, &amp; the stone of Israel: God of thy father shall be thy helper, &amp; th'Almighty shall blesse thee more ouer wt h heauenly blessings from aboue, &amp; of the depth that ys beneath, &amp; wt h the blessinges of the papps &amp; wombe lykewyse. Blessings of thy father were wt h blessings of his fathers strengthned vntill that the desyre of the eternall hills appeared. vpon the head of Ioseph, &amp; on the crowne of the Nazarit amongst his brethren let all these same benedictions light. And Beniamin a raueninge woolfe that in the morninge eate his pray, &amp; in th'eueninge deuid'd the spoyle that he did get. Sonnes I am gather'd to my people, as I commandment gaue see that you bury me wt h my fathers in the duble caue wc h is in Hebron agaynst mambre in the land of chanaan wc h Abraham bought, &amp; where his &amp; my parents corps remayn Well now my sonnes for a fare well this my last counsell take: Loue god wt h all your hearts, &amp; hym th'ende of your actions make: &amp; when that I am dead I wish you all frendy to bee one to an other, for yt's fitt that brothers should lyue brotherly. Do yll to none, but good to all, &amp; iniuryes forgeue &amp; so my sonnes adew, for now I can no longer lyue. Ioseph My father now plucks vp his feete vpon his bedd &amp; dyeth wc h from myne eyes enforceth teares, so much his death me greeueth but syth yt's gods will so to bee, I'l myne conforme to his &amp; take of hym my last fare well now wt h a louinge kisse. Good Brothers let his body be to the phisitions caryed wt h out delay, that yt by them wt h spice may be enbaulmed &amp; when the tyme of mourning's past I will procure of pharao leaue wt h my fathers corps into chanaan for to go his exequies to celebrate, &amp; in the duble caue wc h Abraham bought I will yt bury, as he commandment gaue. Ruben Now ys the funerall of our father past wt h great solennity &amp; we Eleauen brethren are return'd wt h Ioseph safly into Ãgypt wt h all our trayne: But sore we stand in feare lest that Ioseph remember still the wronge we hym dyd offer &amp; hym selfe do reuenge on vs now when our father's dead where fore. let's go see yf by our submission he will be pacifyed Iudas. your counsell's good, &amp; here he comes, preuent hym brother Ruben Ruben We you besech for to forgett the wicked act of your brethren &amp; the synne &amp; the malice that agaynst you they committed as in his name our father bade vs say before he dyed to you, &amp; we also desyre you to forgeue th'iniquity vnto the seruants of your fathers god, of your mere mercy Ioseph Brothers lay all your feare asyde. Can we resist gods will? you euill thought agaynst me but god turn'd to good that yll that he might me exalt, as at this present you do see, &amp; that I might many peoples saue: wherefore all feare expell yee for I'l you &amp; your litle ones feede, &amp; all thinges needefull geue you &amp; you, and all my fathers house here wt h me shall continue whyle that I lyue.
