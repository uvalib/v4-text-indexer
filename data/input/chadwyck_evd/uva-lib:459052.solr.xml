      <field name="fulltext">THE VNFORTVNATE LOVERS: A Tragedie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE PHILIP Earle of Pembroke and Montgomery, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Were you but halfe so humble to confesse, As you are wise to know your happinesse; Our Author would not grieve to see you sit Ruling with such unquestion'd power his wit: What would I give, that I could still preserve My loyaltie to him, and yet deserve Your kinde opinion, by revealing now The cause of that great storme which clouds his brow, And his close murmurs, which since meant to you, I cannot thinke, or mannerly or true. Well; I begin to be resolv'd, and let My melancholy tragicke Mounsieur fret; Let him the severall harmelesse weapons use Of that all-daring tristle, call'd his Muse; Yet I'll informe you what this very day Twice before witnesse, I have heard him say, Which is, that you are growne excessive proud, For ten times more of wit then was allow'd Your silly Ancestors in twenty yeere, Y'expect should in two houres be given you here: For they he sweares, to th'Theatre would come Ere they had din'd to take up the best roome; There sit on benches, not adorn'd with Mats, And graciously did vaile their high-crown'd Hats To every halfe dress'd Player, as he still Through th'hangings peep'd to see how th'house did fill. Good easie judging soules, with what delight They would expect a jigge or Target fight, A furious tale of Troy, which they ne're thought Was weekly written, so 'twere strongly fought. Laught at a clinch, the shadow of a jest, And cry a passing good one I protest. Such dull and humble-witted people were Even your fore-fathers, whom wee govern'd here; And such had you seen too hee sweares, had not The Poets taught you how t'unweave a plot, And tract the winding Scenes, taught you to admit What was true sense, not what did sound like wit. Thus they have arm'd you 'gainst themselves to fight, Made strong and mischievous from what they write: You have beene lately highly feasted here With two great wits, that grac'd our Theatre, But, if to feed you often with delight, Will more corrupt then mend your appetite; Hee vowes to use you, which he much abhorres, As others did, your homely Ancestors.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Verona.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter Rampino, Brusco, Hirco. Rampino. Come Gentlemen, I'll shew you the whole Court, Hirco. (I thinke) was never here before. Brusco. Never? he takes these o'r-growne babes, These tender suckings Gyants of the guard For Colonels of Switzerland, each Usher Of the presence for a famous leader; Hirco. Yes, of women in the darke. Ramp. Why dost thou sneake and tread so bashfully Behind? come boldly on, they'll thinke thee else A City spie that seekes for leave to arrest. Brusc. He lookes as if hee had a blacke Jacke under His cloake, and came to beg budge at the Buttery. Ramp. Move on, This is the presence, Gentlemen, Hence in your passage to the privie Chamber; You should erect your fingers to your hayre, Which being ordered thus,âor, having used Your little Tortoise-combe to titubate Your empty heads; you may salute those of But halfe a fortune thus with halfe a face, The favorite with your entire frame, here Hee is your Idoll, your Religion else Will be believ'd hereticall. Hirco. Rampino, walke no further into sight, Our Generalls pleasure was, wee should not be Discovered, yet for feare it chance to make His comming knowne, 'tis sudden, and by stealth. Enter Ascoli, Galeotto, Amaranta, who whisper together. Ramp. Young Ascoli our Prince, Brusco, retire. Brusco. Since my last visit to the Camp, he's growne Tall man; and he becomes his growth, wee that Pursue the sullen businesse of the warre, Long much to shew him to the foe; not in his Perfume and his silkes; but yron best. There he must change his gentle lookes, and learne To frowne; men thinke his courage great. Ramp. Brusco, hee will make good in future Acts Of chivalrie mens best beliefe, and has A nature corrupted yet, with exeecise Of guilt, his ignorance in sinne makes all His errors seeme but rash mistakes; and well That false Galeotto knowes how to subdue A heart, whose innocence is all The armour of his breast. Brusc. Is that Galeotto his deare favorite? Ramp. It is; hee was a souldier in his youth, And had the lucke of earely victories, Which rais'd him to a restlesse pride, such as He since maintaines by wicked arts of Court, The horror of his thoughts ought make him sad, 'Tis a melancholy doth cause him groane At night, but they're Mandrakes grounds and still Bode death; nor is his mirth lesse dangerous: For like the wanton play of Perpoises, It prophesies a storme, and when he shakes His foe by the hand, 'tis not in kindnesse, but To reach his pulse, that hee may feele how soone Nature would kill whom he long since prescribed. Brusc. What Lady's that? his eyes so overlookes? Hirco. I could lie perdue with her all night i'th snow. Ramp. 'Tis faire Amaranta, Galeotto's daughter; The beauty of her minde, shines in her face: For she is good as faire, and more to urge Her excellence, her vertues are so great, They overmatch his vice; but lucklesse maide, She mournes within, and loves the noble Duke Our Generall, ev'n with a sicke and waking heart. Ascol. This newes hath much of joy, and somewhat too Of wonder in't, Duke Altophil our Generall So neere the towne, stolne hither to prevent The triumphs due unto his victory. Gileot. It is your Highnesse custome to give trust To my intelligence, and this hath truth Enough to merit your beliefe; but as You ever have, vouchsafe your helpe to make Me prosperous; so I beseech you now Assist my daughters pensive Love. This Duke Is high in worth, as in his blood, and may, If you procure him, choose her for his wife, By his alliance so confirme my family, That I shall need to feare no change of time, No angrie fate, but from your Princely selfe. Ascol. Faire Amaranta, dost thou love Duke Altophil? It is a choyce so excellent, you need Not blush to owne the passions of your heart. Amaranta. Sir since it was his vertues taught me how To love, I hope my modestie may give Me leave still to confesse it to the world. Ascol. His judgement seldome harbours neere his eyes, If he can looke on so much beauty, and Not wish to make it his, but Gentle maide, Trust me, I shall perswade him to this happinesse With all my power and skill. Amaran. It is a favour that My prayer shall endevour to requite, Though I am doubtfull how to owne it from Mine owne desires. Galeotto. Amaranta, peace. I am the elder begger Sir, and by Continuall practice want no confidence To aske your helpe at all necessities. Ascol. This, Galeotto, is a kindnesse to My selfe, I long to see those nuptialls consummate, Where each so much deserves the others love; Let's in and make enquirie of the cause, Why his arrivall is so much conceal'd.â Exeunt Ascoli, Galeotto, Amaranta. Brusc. But why Rampino, since this Lady is So rarely qualified, and being heire To all her fathers wealth and hopes, doth not Our Generall make her lawfull mistresse of His bed. Ramp. The cause is evident: for his Affections and his faith already are Ingag'd unto the beautifull Arthiopa. Brusc. Arthiopa? The daughter of our old Dead Generall? alas, his fame was greater then His fortune, for he left her poore. Ramp. Most true; So poore, she was constrain'd to live conceal'd Here in Verona, and become ('tis thought) Her Lovers chaste and thankfull pensioner; And you have heard what strange reports were oft Dispers'd into our campe of her disloyalty: Some sawcily would stile it lust, and those Were punish'd for their loose and slippery tongues. Brusc. It seemes then our Duke Altophil retaines Her still in's breast with's former confidence. Ramp. She growes the faster to his heart, for hee Had strong suspicions to believe these tales By Galeotto forg'd, who strives, it seemes, By this poore Ladies infamie, to make More easie roome for his faire daughters Love. Hirco. O, how full of mischiefe are these wise men! Brisco. It would be long Hirco, ere wee could squeeze Such another plot out of thy leane head. Ramp. Never, though it were crushed to a circumference So small, that he might make a Helmet of A Hazle-Nut. Hirco. Well Gentlemen, you'll find Our Generall an angry man ere night, Take that from my intelligence, though I Receiv'd it since wee came to towne i'th streets. Brusco. How, Hirco, come the newes? Hirco. The Lady that You call Arthiopa, this morning, was Arrested in her Chamber by the Officers Of the Purgation house, and's thither sent To suffer for unchastity. Ramp. The Divell made thee drunk with spirit of Sulphure. Hirco. I'm sure this is the peoples language now, And talk'd on too, by children two foot high, And more three witnesses (whom they believe Brib'd and suborn'd) have all depos'd against Her maiden-head; that was the phrase. Ramp. Here will we knocke ere long, let them that have No money take up plasters upon trust: Brusco. Away, let's to Saint Laurence port, it was Our Generalls will we should be expected there.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Galeotto, Morello. Galeot. Morello, I'me subdu'd with thy fine Arts; Thou art as swift to execute as to Contrive, how did our witnesses behave Themselves when they beheld Arthiopa? Morel. Good faith (my Lord) valiant Rogues that had Full oft o'rcome their consciences before; And therefore, to resist her blushes, thought It but an easie victory: the Articles Were many they did t'accuse her chastity, Which they both read and swore to in a breath, And wish'd them longer for your Lordships sake, Protesting their good natures check'd them, cause They earn'd their money with so little paines. Galeot. How did the Governours o'th severe house Digest the imployment my request did lay Upon their gravitie? Morello. They are a kinde Of more solemne Villaines, and like old fishes, Choose to demur and swim about the bait A while, ere they would catch what afterwards They swallowed greedily. Galeot. I thanke their tendernesse. Morello. It seem'd at first, as if her innocence And beauty would pervert their justice to Rebell against your Lordships power; but then Presuming pity was a little too Effeminate for ancient Magistrates, They thought upon your gold, and had decreed Her to the whip, but that I interpos'd To mitigate their purchas'd wrath. Galeot. 'Twas safely done, for such severity Would too much exasperate her friends. Morel. Their sentence is, shee must from that devout Chaste Colledge march, vested in white, and with A purifying Taper in her hand To the Cathedrall Church. Galeot. If Altophil doe breed his honour with Strict discipline, or have but any taste Of wisdome in her Love, this imputation will Divorce her from his eyes, my Amaranta then Hath no impediment to terrifie her hopes; These mischiefes make me more indebted to My braine, in that they are obscurely laid, And I their guilty author am unknowne.â Enter Amaranta. Amaranta. O Sir, if either teares or fervent prayers Can move you to compassion, shew it now! My woman halfe deprived of breath with her Astonishment and hast, imperfectly Hath told me newes so sad, would make a fierce Young Thrasian-souldier weep before his Bride. Galeot. This newes were sad indeed! what is it? is it hoh! Or, if it be too fearefull for speech, Bring here thy Lute, and breath it in a song. Amaranta. My vertuous Rivall, poore Arthiopa, Is in distresse; shee suffers shame, such vile Abuse, as lips well taught, will blush to utter of afflicted Enemies. Galeot. What is this to mee? Amaranta. Sir she's guiltlesly betray'd, I'll gage My yet unspotted fame, nay, all The Treasure of my soule she's most innocent; Therefore I begge you would imploy your power To take her from the rigour of the Law, And punish those that have perverted it To exercise their cruelty. Galeot. Away thou meeke religious foole, thee to Thy closet, goe; and wish thy needle forme In shadow'd works, some ruthfull Lovers death, Then weep the silly story out, untill Thy teares staine all thy silke; Hence from my sight.â Amaran. Alas, thou wrong'd Arthiopa, thou canst Not hope for truer griefe then mine. When other virgins shall lament thy death.â Exit, Galeot. Morello, haste, and lay out severall spies For Altophil's reproach, and bring mee word To whom his earliest visits are adress'd.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Altophil, Rampino, Brusco, Hirco. Altophil. Hah! gone? there's treachery of State in this, From her small solitary mansion ta'en, Where she liv'd cloyster'd up, cag'd like a bird, To mourne my absence in a pensive song; Forc'd thence, and by sterne Officers, Hirco, What did the people say? Hirco. I know not, Sir, There is no trusting to their whisperings: Their murmurs are but noyse, uncertaine, Sir, And not to be believed. Altophil. Good souldier speake, Deale justly with his griefes; what did they say? Hirco. Why Sir, they talk'd as if, pray doe not heare't, All they discourse is out of rage or drinke. Altophil. I pray thee vex me not with thy o'rewise Ill manner'd Love, it is not safe; what did they say? Ramp. S'light, tell the Generall. Hirco. Why if you needs will know, 'tis given out She was convey'd to the holy Colledge, Sir, The new purgation house, where witnesses Have severally depos'd shee was unchaste. Altophil. Blisters and rottennesse consume thy tongue, Villaine, thou hast talk'd away thy life.â drawes upon him. Brusco. Oh, hold Sir, hold, can you enforce A slander from him, and then punish it Your selfe? your sword upon your vassell too.â Hirco. If Rogues will beare false witnesse, can I help't Cause they lose their soules, must I lose my life? Ramp. Galeotto, Sir, the favorite, may be With argument enough suspected Chiefe In this conspiracie. Altophil. Thou dost receive My jealous feares with truth too nak'd And evident to be conceal'd. What is That holy Colledge he's in, madnesse nam'd? Ramp. A place to whip offenders for their lust. Altoph. O heavens! why is your businesse so remote And high that you can take no notice of Such wrongs as these? was this the house thought fit To entertaine Arthiopa? Furies And Fiends ascend; take up your dwelling here: For all this goodly City I'll convert Into one spreading fume; a fire so large And hot, shall make the Rivers seethe, and Seas To boyle without the trouble of a storme. Ramp. Kill all you meet, and burne the rest that are Imprison'd or asleepe. Ramp. Let's thinke of rising first, then fire shops after, Though I must needs weare silkes, I doe not like Flame-colour'd Taffata. Hirco. I'ld faine to the Mercers too, And fall a measuring with my yron yard. Altophil. Wy Brusco, dost thou stand so lamely now; When I perceive my injuries so great? Our patience will be held no vertue, but a sinne, Draw up the scatter'd troopes that winter'd here. Brusco. O Sir, ease your distemper with Your wiser thoughts; the Prince you know's in towne, He's gracious, and will doe you right; lose not The fame your noble youth hath justly merited, With one rash act, which must be treason call'd; And so interpreted by all the Court: Then thinke what danger a commotion here Would urge, since Hildebrand the Lombards King, (Our watchfull enemy) is now within Ten leagues strongly encamp'd.â Enter Carthusian, Arthiopa, who is held by him, cloth'd in white, a Taper in her hand, people and boyes following her. Altophil. What meanes this sad and bashfull spectacle, My friends? What penitentiall Lady's that You wait on with such needlesse courtesie? You, Sir, speak can you tell? are you all dumb?â they run from him as affraid. Here's one whose habite promises so much Civility as will afford me a reply.â speakes to the Carthusian. Pray, Sir, instruct me in this Ladies name, And what's the cause her penance is expos'd Thus to the publique view? Ramp. He's a Carthusian, and by's order, ty'd To a concealement of his tongue; he must not speake. Altophil. Sure I have had some knowledge of her face. Arthiopa. 'Tis Altophil, the Lord of all my vowes, Sweet Heaven let fall a cloud and hide me in't, That my shame since undeserv'd may be, Conceal'd from all but you. I aske not for Revenge from men, their justice I have felt So cruell on my selfe, that I not dare Wish it to those who thus have injur'd mee. Altophil. Mine eyes have been too bold; It is not fit they should discover her In so much shame, yet it must be she. O heart! heart! if ever thou wert made for love, Love would have weav'd thy strings not of such tough And stubborne wire, but silke, such as would cracke With halfe that weight which hangs upon his griefe. Arthiopa!â Arthiopa. Flie, flie, my Lord, and follow not this light. It is that walking fire within the night Misleads the traveller, and like an Unwholesome mist about it, needs must blast Whom it shall tempt to wander from his wits. Altophil. Stay, stay, 'tis instant death to take her hence; Though all your tyrants of the Law were here, They would fall downe, downe at her feet, and hide Their anticke faces, that doe fright poore prisoners more Then their false sentence when they're halfe asleep. Forgive me reverend Sir, I know in this Your Office you but serve some high command; Lend me this Lady for a short discourse, And on my honour I'll restore her to Your charge; the Lawes shall be exactly satisfi'd.â takes her aside. Arthiopa. Surely Altophil th'art lately come from heaven; For this is more then humane courtesie To owne a lucklesse virgine, so much lost In sorrow and distresse. Altophil. Preserve thy teares; This is a wicked place, such pretious drops Should not bedew unhallowed ground, thy infamy Is meant to me, and thou art punish'd for My envi'd Love; I must be so, the proofes Are pregnant that perswade my faith. Arthiopa. My sorrowes will seeme easie to me, though accompany'd with death, such is the joy I take, that you believe mee guiltlesse of A crime, which, though I blush to name, yet I Must owne before the world in punishment. The Angells, if they had but leasure to Descend, would testifie I am betrayed. Altophil. And I Arthiopa, to vindicate Thy fame (yet shew obedience to the Lawes) In these injurious penitentiall weeds, Will leade thee streight unto that Church, To which thy penance is prescrib'd, and there I'll marry thee in scorne of all the dull Abused world; goe on.â Shee kneeles. Arthiopa. O, Sir, though I Am strictly chaste, most true and loyall to Your Love, respect the honour of your House (Renown'd in war, and forraigne Courts) how will It be defil'd, when y'are ally'd not unto me Alone? but to my shame, that is a staine So deepe and publique now, not all my teares, Though they could fall in showres, will wash't away? Altophil. Goe on, my resolution needs no vowes. Brusco. Where is your reason, Sir? you that are wise Enough to governe Armies in their rage, In your owne fury, now should be so wise To rule your selfe; though this sweet Ladies truth And vertues sacred are, and firme to our Beliefe; yet in the high importance of A wife, you should take care to match where not A single doubt, though ne're so weake, could be By Envie urg'd? Arthiopa. Sir, you have borrow'd much Of time; much have you seene, and speake from all Discreet experience, and your Love I know: You love your Duke; therefore in this advice You have my thanks sincerely from my soule. Altophil. Old man, could'st thou convey thy heart into My breast, and so possesse my griefe: could'st thou With my subdu'd moyst eyes behold the great Gonsalvo's daughter, Mistresse of my life, Disgrac'd thus, like the peoples sinfull off-spring In the street; how would it stir thy blood? And then to know her sufferance treacherously Contriv'd by power; one that did malice all Our holy vowes, I'll not indure't;âburne, burne The towne; kill, kill all you meet. Hirco. Rampino, raise the old garrison i'th Citadell, I'll to the Sconse behind the bridge. Ramp. Since they doe love to see a souldiers Mistresse In a white sheet, wee'll see their wives in their Smockes too before night. Brusc. Stay, stay, is this your love unto your Generall? Or thirst to pillage and to bloodâ Arthiopa. Sir, let me quench your anger with my teares; Upon my knees let me request you leave Me to mine owne misfortune, and the Lawes, This dangerous act would voiolate all your Allegiance to the Prince. Brusc. Thinke on your selfe, and us that must depend Upon your better hopes. Altoph. My faire white mourner, rise; You with your Priesty office, leade the way; 'Tis to the Church, shee shall obey the Law. Hold high the Taper, and move boldly on; Know injur'd Hymen, 'tis thy torch, and this My wedding day; disswade me not, my soule Hath vow'd it, and 'tis seal'd in heav'n, you that Affect your Generall, follow, and afford Me streight your shouts of joy, not wealth, Wisdome nor honour, is to me above (Severall shouts are heard within. The fame and resolution of my Love.â Exeunt omne, and streight several shouts etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter Brusco, Hirco. Brusco. Hirco, have you appeas'd the mutiny The Generalls discontents did raise Amongst his frie of friends, our tatter'd camp- Companions in the streets? Hirco. All's quiet now, They sadly weare their fingers in their pockets, Which they did hope ere this should have beene us'd In telling Pistolets and Chickeens.â Enter Rampino. Brusco. Rampino, 'tis expected you bring peace. Ramp. Two houres I have beene preaching on A stall to certaine Carre-men that took't ill In a good cause they might not hang with our Cast troops, to pull downe houses, and to rob An hereticall new Church or two; but they Are gone swearing, and well edified: come, What newes? Is our Generall marry'd? Brusco. Not yet. Ramp. How? not marri'd? Brusco. No, some small spie that watch'd Which way the current of his discontents Would runne, convey'd it to the Court, and streight The Prince himselfe sent to forbid the banes. Ramp. The embers are but cover'd yet, I feare When they are stirr'd, the fire will flame agen. Brusc. Our Duke convey'd the Lady to his house: Repair'd to Court, where the kind Prince with praise And joy receiv'd him in his open armes. Ramp. This qualifies the heat of our affaires. Brusco. He then laid out for those spies that were Suborn'd against his Ladies fame, who with Severe inquiry being produc'd, had strict Examination from the Prince; a while They justified their oaths; but still Falshood betray'd it selfe: for when He urg'd for names of persons, time and place, With doubtfull termes, and words dis-joynted, they Began to stammer out their evidence; Then Altophil claimes leave he may present Their worships with an odde engine of pleasure. Ramp. Which courteous politcians call a Rocke. Brusc. The same, and each with painfull leisure was Slowly wound up.â Ramp. Like a huge Jack-weight, by a weake sicke wench. Brusc. Right, Sir, and then they both confess'd that Saint Goleotto brib'd them to this perjury. And know my joy-sweet, wanting men of war, He is by'th Prince imprison'd in the fort. Ramp. An excellent Prince, by this hand he sha'not want: First I'll forgive him all my pay; then Hirco, Thou shall lend him money. Hirco. Excuse me, Sir, Upon securitie, not else; I've been Too often bit that way already. Retire Gentlemen. Enter Ascoli, Altophil, Galeotto, who is held by the Gard. Ascol. Though thou hast so behav'd thy selfe in war With wise directions, and a valiant arme, That fortune cannot boast a share in thy Fam'd victories; yet I must chide thee Altophil, Since being mine, and so much lov'd, thou couldst Unto a Lady give thy selfe away, Not freed by my consent. Altoph. Sir, I have ask'd your pardon, and believe My joyes you did lessen with your sorrowes, To make them by your kindnesse now more full. Ascol. This separation will be short, for since Your Mistresse innocence is by her false accusers Clear'd unto the world, Your Nuptialls I will celebrate with all The glory I can adde to'th triumph of A friend; and you Galeotto, shall receive Such punishment as shall declare My justice equall to your crime. Galeot. Sir, I confesse your favour lifted me To hope alliance with the noble Duke, Which, had I lawfully contriv'd, perhaps, Th'ambition had not much been blam'd; But I am left: nor would I begge Forgivenesse of your Lawes, but of your selfe, And next my Lord of you; be pleas'd to thinke The wrong were not of malice but of pride. Altophil. Not the eldest Divell with his long practice had The skill to lay on me so great a wrong, But I could pardon it; unlesse when I Perceive the whitenesse of my Mistresse vertue stain'd, Betray'd to penance too, it were a cruelty The Fiends would sooner weepe at then commend. Galeot. Then I'll provide to suffer, and to scorne That fate I cannot alter with my prayer. Ascoli. Thou, once the health, art poyson now to sight, 'Tis wholsomer to looke upon the Basiliske; Perfidious to my friend! but where's Rangone, That went to fetch your Mistresse? Altophil, I never saw her yet; trust mee you are A cunning Lover, so long conceal'd The beauty you admire.â Enter Rangone, Arthiopa richly attyr'd. Rangone. Madam, your sweetnesse doth deserve the best Of joyes; and I have brought you where they are. Ascoli. What light is this, that ere the day is spent Breakes like a second morning in our eyes, Whil'st all that's shining else shewes like a shade. About her beames, sweet as the pretious smoake Ascending from the funerall fire o'th long- Liv'd bird of Arabia.ââ Rangone. You sent me for this Lady, Sir, will you Not speake to her? see where shee kneeles. Ascoli. O rise! if I have trespass'd in neglect, Forgive thy beauty, and not it's that Hath forc'd my wonder to adore what I (Perhaps) by'th lawes of courtesie should first Salute.â Arthiopa. Sir, though I never fear'd my stocke Of modestie so small, that I could want It for my necessary use; yet I Shall need to borrow blushes, if you lay More beautie to my charge then I dare owne. Ascoli. Where have I liv'd, that I could never heare Sweet musique untill now? O Altophil! I finde the treasure of thy love so great, That were it mine, I should not blame The envie of a friend; since from the excesse Of judgement, when it values things at full, Our envie growes, it is our nicity To call that envie sinne Altophil. What meanes the Prince? Ascoli. Was she that was so delicate, and soft as is The purple fleece of Clowds? was she thought fit T'indure the rigour o'th perverted Law? Convey the traytor hence, and never more Presume to set thy treacherous foot upon The confines of my Land. Arthiop. I, so yo'uld vouchsafe to make my mercy an Example unto yours, I shall forgive his cruelties. Ascoli. It were an injury to heaven; away, If the next time I in my Dominions spy This loathed face, thy life is forfeited. Galeot. Sir, I'll presume yo'uld thinke my daughter had No share in my unluckie guilt; therefore It were not like your usuall justice, she should suffer in my losse. Ascoli. She is too good for thy society, Her vertues shall preserve her here. Galeot. Peace crowne you at home, and victory abroad.â Exit with the Gard. Ascol. Know, Altophil, my darkest thoughts are not So secret to my selfe, but I dare trust Thy knowledge with them, and be safe. Why then should thy intentions or desires Be hid from me? I faine would sound thy breast With a new question; prithee give me leave? Altophil. Sir, I am borne to follow your command. Aske what you please; if I want knowledge here To satisfie your doubt, I'll studie to Know more; pray speake. Ascol. It is decree'd by th'powers above (whom no Dull earthly mediation can disswade Or alter) I must needs marry faire Arthiopa. Altophil. I look'd for comfort, Sir, From your consent, not trouble from your doubts. Ascoli. It is inevitable then, as the Conjunction of th'illustrious Planets are, That needs must meet; else all the Spheres will streight Be out of tune; time breake his glasse, and throw The sand in the Sunn's eyes to make him winke, And leave us in the darke. Speake, must it be? Or else you both will suffer an eclipse? Make answer from thy kinde thoughts? is it Decreed? Altophil. It is: and nought can alter it but death. Ascoli. How hardly then hath nature dealt with us: For we are prisoners all; all circumscrib'd, And to our limits ty'd: the fortunate And lucklesse are alike: for thou art with As strict necessitie unto thy happinesse Confin'd, as others to their evill fate. Altoph. To be her prisner, Sir, is to be free; Nor can I wish my bondage off, whil'st I Am fetter'd in her armes. Ascol. You'll give mee leave To try how far your Mistresse hath ingag'd Her faith, and not be jealous, Altophil. Altoph. I'll trust such vertue with mine enemy.â Ascoli withdrawes with Arthiopa. Ah me! where is a Lovers wealth? what joy Is there of beauty, when once conceal'd, more then Of Jewels in the darke? but when reveal'd, We stand to th'hazard of anothers claime. Rangone. I doe not like this alteration in the Prince, If he doth love, I feare it is too late. Ascol. Oh do not promise so much comfort in Your lookes, and in your language breathe dispaire, 'Tis like fantastick April, that ere-while With gaudy Sunne beames smil'd upon the Spring, And in a minutes space gathers the blacke Thicke clouds about his brow to make a storme; Have you no pitie left? Arthiopa. My pitie, Sir, you'll hardly entertaine, Since it must come alone without reliefe. Ascol. Why were you trusted with such beautious wealth, And make such hastie bargaines for your selfe? Could you have skill to know the value of Your love, and give it all way at once? Arthiopa. Sir, I beseech you doe not urge me to Deny, what in your gentler clemencie You should forbeare to aske, heaven made my vowes, And they are Altophils. Ascoli. No more, my trespasse I'll decline, though I Augment my griefes; my Altophil farewell.â takes him by the hand When thou dost heare me sicke, thinke what disease Arthiopa's neglect might once have bred In thee, then mourne me at that rate; Rangone, come, leade to the Cypresse grove.â Exit Ascoli, Rangone. Altophil. Thou art as much unfortunate as faire. But smile upon thy stars, perhaps they may Be sooth'd into a kinder influence.

'Tis his Taylor, he owes him money. Ramp. How did the Rascall finde me out? I shift My lodging as often as conveniently I can remove my Truncks; thrice in two dayes, Would's needle stucke acrosse his throat. Friskin. Signior Rampino,â Ramp. Signior Friskin,âI thought it should be you. And how deare heart, and how, how does thy wife? My Godson too at nurse; I've a little whistle For him, 'tis comming in the Generalls Court. Friskin. All well Signior, Doe the wars thrive, Sir; Is there any money stirring? Ramp. Faith some of us here, By our continuall practice, know a Ducket From a Counter, w've mauld King Hieldebrand. Friskin. We heare he is encamp'd som ten leagues hence. Ramp. Yes, we have put him to his Sallads, like A sawcy Frog upon anothers meadow. Friskin. Signior, there is an old debt. Ramp. Do'st thou thinke I have forgot it? I prithee What skirt's in fashion now the Jacket-way; Downe to the hammes? Friskin. No Sir, sixe in a ranke; But Sir, the debt is old. Ramp. I, I, with all my heart; how are their cloaks? A square-full cape? Friskin. Just as you left them, Sir; Would you would thinke upon your debt. Ramp. Do'st thinke I doe not; I prithee bring me but A patterne of a Polish coat, I'd weare it loose And short; pray Gentlemen know my friend; believ't I'd rather see him sit crosse-legg'd then any man In Lumbardy; his thimble on, and's needle thusâ He'll runne a tilt through cloth two inches thicke. Brusco. Is he so excellent? he shall make my cloaths. Hirco. And mine too, if he please. Friskin. Have they any sorts, Sir, are they well stor'd? Ramp. A brace of rich close curmudginely fellowes, Thou seest they care not what their outside is, So their pockets be well lin'd. Friskin. It seemes they are a little carelesse, Sir, indeed; Where is your lodging now? Ramp. In troth 'twill be in the old mansion neere The Palace yard, till six of clocke at night, But then I must remove, the Fidlers doe So often waken me with their mutton'd Gridyrons And good-morrowes, I cannot sleepe for them; I'll send thee word where I shall fix. Friskin. And you'll remember, Sir, my bill. Ramp. Do'st thinke I'll faile; I prithee bring thy weights Along with thee, we shall else wrangle about light gold. Friskin. Y'are welcome, Sir, to towne. Ramp. Away, lest we be vex'd againe with new Solicitors for the old cause.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Galeotto, Gandolpho, Morello. Galeotto. Is Amaranta sent for by the Prince? Morello. She is, but for what use I could not learne; My brother, whom your former bounties have Preferr'd, and late made Captaine of the Fort, Is come, Sir, to bewaile your miseries, And proffer all his service, to make knowne, Your losse cannot disswade his gratitude. Gandol. My Lord, from low deservings you have rais'd Me to the best command this place affords A souldiers hope, but if my life can pay Your bountie, I will keepe it for that use. Galeotto. Your natures are so thankfull, Gentlemen, For little benefits, that I am taught, If ever I can reach my former power, T'oblige more friends, though with a greater charge. Morello. My Lord, your wisdome hath the skill to cure A disease stronger then your fortune feeles. Galeotto. Greatnesse hath still a little taint i'th blood; And often 'tis corrupted neere the heart; But these are not diseases held, till by The Monarch spide; who our ambition feeds Till't surfets with his love; nor doe wee strive To cure or take it from ourselves, but from His eyes, and then our medicine wee apply Like th'weapon-salve, not to our selves, but him Who was the sword that made the wound; and this State medicine is compos'd of flattering industry, And such false cures as like to false alarmes Fright men to feare danger, when none is neere, Still vex'd, and busie to no reall use, As drones that keepe most noyse about the hive, And then devour the politique Court Flies What foolish Bees bring on their weary thighes. Morel. These Lectures (my Gandolpho) shew a braine That will preserve him, spight of power; my Lord, My broher is your owne, and wee will share The hazard of your fortune. Galeotto. The Captaine hath a valiant soule; and I Perhaps may use him in a close designe, That i'th successe will richly pay his love. Gandolph. When y'are most confident of me, you can't Expect so much as I'll performe. Galeotto. Enough; Morello, Sir, shall undertake For my beliefe, to all you dare Make promise of; if you will please to bring Me to the Ports, where short the allowance of My time will force mee take a sad farewell, I'll breathe my love, and businesse to you bothâ Exeunt. Enter Altophil, Arthiopa. Altoph. Gladnesse possesse my Mistresse thoughts; I'm told The Count Rangone from the Prince is now Alighted at my gates, good newes I hope; For though we live as in a covent here, Thou as my Nunne, to morrow may proclaime This house a Court, and you my cheerfull Bride. Arthiop. The frownes of heav'n is to the vertuous like Those thicke darke clouds, poore wand'ring Sea-men spie, Which oft fore-tell their happinesse, and shew The long expected land is neereâ Enter Rangone, Amaranta her face vail'd. Rangone. Felicity and everlasting fame Betide the noble Generall: thus I Am bid salute you from our mighty Prince. Altophil. I am the creaure of his power and will. Rangone. I with this gentle greeting must present The richest treasure nature in her last Declining stocke of beauty could afford The world, behold it and admire,â Unvailes Amaranta, who weepes. Her eyes dissolving thus in teares, should teach Thy heart to melt; for know, thou cruell Lord, She long hath chastly sickned for thy love. Altophil. Alas, unluckie maid! how can thy griefes Expect comfort from him that knowes not to Redresse his owne? Amaranta. Yet, Sir, I hope 'tis in Your power t'excuse th'unwilling error of My modesty; I surely am the first Sad Lady ever was constrain'd to seeke Her Lover, and then woo him too, but 'tis The Prince hath forc'd mee here to nourish my Affection with your reall sight, that else Had been conceal'd, and with your shadow fed. Arthiopa. Poore Amaranta, I must needs lament The malice of thy fortune, though My pity shewes unkindnesse to my selfe. Rangone. Sir, my Commission's to aske, if you Can love and celebrate this Ladie for Your wife; and our kinde Prince, besides the forfeited Possessions of her fathers wealth, will to her dowrie adde honours and lands, untill You share his royaltie. Altophil. Too soone this am'rous Riddle is resolv'd; He Loves Arthiopa, and would Enforce mee wed this Ladie, to assure More easie way for's owne desires. Arthiopa. O, Altophil, were I not well Instructed in thy loyaltie, how soone Her beautie, and these soothing hopes would throw Me cold into the armes of death. Altophil. Sir, you must carry to the Prince what I Was never wont to send; a harsh deniall of His suite: and give me leave to say 'tis troublesome, And too severe. Amaranta. How am I lately hardened with the use Of sorrowes, that I can listen to My angrie doome and live? Rangone. Summon your wise, Your kinder thoughts, and make such reply As I may joy in the deliverie; And soone procure a mutuall happinesse. Altophil. To court me to a better knowledge of my blisse Then I alreadie understand, Were but a vaine attempt; I am resolv'd Within the chaste embraces of these armes To live or die. Amaranta. My eares have forfeited their facultie, Why should they still preserve their sense, that could Not for a while be deafe, but needs must hearken to My evill fate? Rangone. Sir, pardon mine obedience to my Prince; For I shall execute a sad command: You of the Guard, lay hold upon the Duke.â Enter the Guard, and seize on Altophil. Altophil. Feare not, Arthiopa, some joy remaines I'th hopes we shall not be divided in Our sufferings. Rangone. Shee is my pris'ner, Sir, And must to Court, whilst you and Amaranta stay Confin'd together in this house. Altopil. False Prince, how cunning is thy crueltie? Arthiopa, Lest we had courage left t'expect an end Of all our calamities, this way was found To make us yet more certaine of despaire. Rangone. In this, Sir, you perceive the intricate Though powerfull influence of love, that doth Pervert most righteous natures to attempt Unjust designes, his Godhead is not full knowne, And's miseries have beene but dully taught To men: for I am charged to say this new Constraint is but a sad experiment To trie if you to Amaranta can Pay equall love for hers, and nice Arthiopa, Returne unto the Prince, what's passions now May challenge as a debt. Arthiopa. O, my true Lord, Shall wee ne'r meet agen, and tell our thoughts? Which still we found too like, as if we two Had but one heart wherein we gave them formes? Altophil. 'Twere sinne to have no hope, wee'll change our starres, For there are many more will gladly take Protection of our loves. Rangone. My time was limited, my witnesse is Become my charge, and must to Court. Arthiopa. Sir, give me leave, but to salute this Lady, Whose friendship, though of noble worth, I shall Too soone receive, too soone (I feare) forsake; You, gentle Amaranta, must enjoy Your blessed habitation here, here with My Lord, whom I would faine commend, not to Your care, but your neglect; for know, We in our virgin-bashfulnesse esteeme Solicitation and addresse, a more Undoubted sinne, then our disdaine. Amaran. Madam, I'm here a pris'ner too, and will Expect like others, in harsh times dirtress'd His pitie, not reliefe; I'll hope for that, If you'll permit without a jealousie. Arthiopa. Preserve me in thy kind remembrance, Altophil. Altophil. What other use have I of memory, When I have conceal'd the records of thee? Arth. Sir, I am loath to leave this Ladie here, Imprisonment is cruell to a Maid; Was it the Princes will shee needs must stay? Rangone. I have receiv'd it in a strict command. Arthiopa. O, Altophil! Sir, let me hide mine eyes; It were some crime 'gainst them, thus to forsake Their chiefest joy, and let them see it too. Altophil. Since Amaranta, wee Must strive to woo, let's learne no mortall love That's dangerous, and quickly ends; but trie To make't eternall which is first to die.â Exeunt omnes.</field>

Ramp. What drowsie ignorance possess'd the Prince To trust with such important power, one whom He knew a traytor to that Villaines lust? Brusc. I, there his reason shew'd herselfe bewitch'd; When he had banish'd Galeotto, and Incens'd his very soule to all malignitie That his invenom'd gall could ere produce; Then to put trust in those he had preferr'd?â Enter Rangone. Rangone. O Gentlemen? to what unseasonable use Doe you advance your weapons, as you meant To threaten the victorious foe? when we Are so much past the likelihood of helpe, That all resistance you can make is but To hasten on the forfeit of your lives. Brusco. If channells must o'reflow with blood, they shall Be fed from proudest veines that highest swell; Theirs who would emptie ours shall open too Ramp. Why should we calmly die, as if we had Drunke cold Mandragona, and breathe our soules Out in our sleepe, departing with lesse noyse Then men that dreame they die; let's venture to Regaine the Fort. Hirco. There are enow to make Scalladoes left, that have not yeelded up Their armes; if wee must fall, it is as good Doe't climbing as thus standing still. Rang. Your forces are too weake, 'tis fortifi'd Alreadie with two Regiments of Switz. I know you thinke, I am as much inclin'd To hazard, as that man, who dares the most In glory or revenge: but this attempt Will onely serve t'incense sterne Heildebrand Against our Prince and Altophil; who with Arthiopa are prisoners, and given To Galeotto's power as a reward: First promiss'd him to purchase his lost faith. Brusco. The Prince our Generall, and his Mistresse too All ta'ne? the destinies are growne too curst,â Drummes a farre off. Stand close, and make this passage good. Enter Heildebrand, Goleotto, Morello, Gandolpho, Souldiers. Heildebrand. What left mis-taken soules are these? who but A piece and remnant of discourag'd strength Presume defiance still, when all the rest Have safely yeelded to our power? Bid them (Galeotto) give their weapons up. Galeot. Why, Gentlemen doe you vainly tempt A danger from his wrath, that not delights To ruine where his mercy is implor'd? Present him your unprofitable swords, And I'll procure a full assurance of Your lives and liberties. Rangone. Kindnesse sounds ill in a traytors tongue, If you had loyall held unto your Prince, Such mediation had been out of use. Galeot. This language is too bold; it doth proclaime Your anger great, and your discretion small. But such untimely choller, know, I can As easily forgive as scorne, and will Requite it, (if you'll yet submit) with a Protection of your throats, that else are in Great danger to swallow no more new wine. Morel. The counsell that hee gives you is not fit To be refus'd. Gandolpho. Y'our brothers of the campe; is it not better To live and spend your pay, when you can get it, Then die, and have it laid out in fun'rall plums? Heildebr. If you will hazard death we can afford it, If you with taking but a little paines Stand still and smile whil'st it is done, If you'll Deserve to live, you shall enjoy the same Kinde mercy wee afford the towne; be free And still protected by your former lawes; But first yeeld up your swords. Brusco. Our swords are all our wealth, take those away And we are left to poverty and shame. Hirco. Your grant already hath allow'd our Citizens The preservation of their lands and goods, Ramp. Shall we fare worse then retailers of small wares? Heildebrand. The tribute of your Armes wee'll but possesse Till night; and then on th'honour of a King, They shall be all restor'd. Rangone. In our resistance, Gentlemen, vainly We give away our lives; let us preserve Them rather for our Princes future use. Brusco. Since it must be, make answer as you please. Rangone. Upon your Kingly word we yeeld. Heildebr. Disarme, and leade them to our Court du-gard, Where, when you have enroll'd their names, take care That our engagement be made good.â Souldiers take away their swords. Ramp. I pray looke to the Ribbon on The Hilt, it is a widowes favour.â Exeunt Rang. Brusco, Ramp. Hirco, souldiers. Heildebr. Where's (Galeotto) your prisoners? Galeotto. Safely confin'd in my owne house, and now, According to your royall grant, I crave The full disposing of their lives. Heildeb. Take our consent, we ne're will lessen what At first our bountie did assure; but then Your secret promise must be straight perform'd. Galeotto. At night, or let mee forfeit all your trust. Heildebr. Leade to the City-Senate, that wee may Receive their homage, and confirme their Lawes, Still weare your secret promise in your thoughts.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Ascoli, Altophil, Arthiopa, their armes bound. Ascoli. My fall from Soveraigne title and command, My losse of that which nature worst can misse, My pleasant liberty; thus being bound Like a cheap slave, that's sold for lesse, then buyes The conqueror the riots of one meale. Not all these suffrings make me mourne so much As my short separation of your loves. Yet, when I saw her faith was so oblig'd And knit unto your vertues, Altophil, I did resigne my nuptiall hopes, and gave Her loyaltie the praise and reverence due Unto a Saint. Arthiopa. Your usage, Sir, I have Confess'd, was noble, though unfortunate, And I shall finde scarce teares enough left to lament My owne captivitie, when I behold My mourning Lords and yours. Altophil. Would there were here Some flowrie banke, shaded with Cypresse, Ewe And Sycamore, whose melancholie brow Hangs o're a little discontented brooke That ever murmurs, as it wisely knew It travell'd to some River that must soone Convey it to the Sea, where they are both In trouble with the bounds and lost. Here wee Would sit, comparing mighty Courts to greater Seas, Where Lovers like small Rivelets are vex'd A while, and then o'rewhelm'd. A rurall residence Neere Woods and Meads, though it be humble, is The place, where we may love and be secure. Altophil. Why then did my too valiant father, and Thy selfe disquiet all the peacefull world With hunting after fame? loaden and crush'd In heavie armour for the chase? toyling To get us this renowne and eminence, Which since hath ruin'd our content? O that We first had met in Shepheards homely weeds! Altophil. I, my Arthiopa, or that wee now Might so enjoy our libertie; then if Ambition did inflame my thoughts to aime At victories, I should not combate for a Crowne, But wrestle for some Chaplet wreath'd by thee Of Daffadills and Pinks. Ascoli. How kindly wee Should take o'th Celestiall Governours, If they would make these wishes reall truth? And mee some neighb'ring Villager that came To joy, and wonder at your loves, to court The beauties of your Mistresse mind, my Altophil, Such Rivalship is noble, though 'tis new. Enter Galeotto, Gandolpho, Morello, Souldiers. Altophil. Appeare, and let thy rage inflict her worst. 'Las! poore Traytor! how dull thy mischiefes are, How weake, that canst invent no punishment To quit thy daughters still neglected Love! But what wee'll suffer, and embrace with scorne. Ascoli. Performe thy malice; come, that wee may laugh To thinke how all posterity will urge Thy deeds in railing Proverbs to expresse Disloyaltie. Arthiopa. And Maids, when they but heare thy name, Shall crosse themselves in superstitious feare. Morello. These are but dang'rous crabbed complements To him that holds your lives in his command. Galeot. Right, Sir, if I could easily remove My gall from off my liver to my heart; But now I take no joy in bitternesse: Thus I requite their wrath, unbind them straight.â Souldier unbind them. Altophil. How's this! What may the courtesie portend? Galeot. Waste not your wonder, Sir, it is no dreame. Altophil. His sinfull nature is converted sure. Galeot. Now, being all made free, you, Altophil, And faire Arthiopa, have but exchang'd These fetters to be joyn'd in everlasting bonds. Start not, they are but Matrimoniall cords; And easie to be worne, though ne're unty'd Such manacles you'll gladly enter in. Arthiop. My prayers have found the neerest way to heaven, How quickly they were heard. Those staines are all Wip'd off, that so disfigur'd thee, thy brow Is quite unwrinckled now, and growes so smooth, Thou wilt not know it in thy former glasse. Ascol. Galeotto! this restores thee to thy kinde Esteeme agen; whil'st I behold their happinsse, I can forgive thy stealth upon my state. Galeot. Convey those Lovers to their bridall chamber, And let the ceremoniall rites be such As I directed them. Altophil. Come my Arthiopa, gladnesse shall leave No roome for Virgin-blushes in thy cheeks.â Exeunt Morello, Altophil, Arthiopa. Ascol. Is my employment void, must I not goe And helpe to celebrate this blessed houre? Galeot. No, Sir, you have a greater businesse of Your owne, and may be thought as happy too, If you will prove as wise in your consent As I am kind to offer it. Ascoli. Instruct me better what you meane. Galeot. You see how your most rigourous doome upon My person and my wealth, enforc'd mee to Such wayes in my revenge, as since have made Me apt for more ambitious hopes then those I lost; This froward Duke held my alliance in Unhallowed worth: Now hee is more in my Contempt; for you (his Master, Sir) I thinke Fitter to choose my daughter as a wife. Ascoli. There's mystery in this discourse. Galeot. 'Tis easie, Sir, when you conceive, that I By marriage now remove Arthiopa From your desires. Ascoli. But I have made a vow, Since she severely did refuse the first Most lawfull passions that I ever felt, All other beauty shall appeare too late. Galeotto. Those are but silly vowes, which Amorists In choller make, when they have vainly spent A frostie night, with singing Madrigalls To some coy Mistresse; whil'st her windowes shut, Consider, this perform'd, my power with Heildebrand May keepe you yet in your Dominions free, Some slender yeerly tribute being paid. Ascoli. It is not in your will to force my Love. Galeotto. Sir, if I should, it were but justice, and Divine; since in my absence you conspir'd T'enforce brave Altophil to make her his; That your desires might suffer no impediment When they should court Arthiopa. Ascoli. Thou rudely dost awake Those thoughts that faine would sleepe; I'll heare no more, Galeotto. Goe, bind him then, and leade him where he was Before restrain'd; you shall have time to meditate, And make your resolutions of more worth. Gandolpho. My Lord, I'll watch him like your Sentinell. Ascoli. Slave, dost thou use me as fond children doe Their Birds, shew me my freedome in a string; And when th'ast play'd with me enough, straight pull Me backe agen to languish in my Cage? This insolence will make her chiefe in hell.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Hirco, Friskin, Fibbia. Fibbia. Well, this is a good King, the Lawes shall have Their course; it matters not who raignes, as long As ev'ry one may come by their owne; if Seignior Rampino pay me not, I can Arrest him now. Friskin. Troth Mistresse Fibbia's in the right; For thus to faile his day, is such a thing, Heaven wil never blesse him. Fibbia. Never, 'Tis impossible he should come to good That failes his day. Heaven keepe my friends from failing of their day. Hirco. Who would have though 't'ad been so great a sin; But the truth is, I ne're studied Divinitie: All that I reade is in the Muster-booke. Friskin. But, as you told us, Sir, Is he so great Already with the new King? Hirco. Upon my honour, hee sent him just now A sword for a present, and thus to me, Because I am his friend. Friskin. Yours (Seignior) is not very rich. Hirco. No, a plaine bandall Hilt; it was his great Great grandfathers, but there are no such blades worne now.â Enter Rampino. I've told your friends here, how much you are In favour now at Court, and they rejoyce, Heartily, beare up; and make it good, Sir, we have reason to be glad; I pray How came't about? may wee learne a little of the State devices? Ramp. Troth partly merit, for you know I weare my cloaths as well as another man; Besides, I had the lucke to be most neere A kinne to him that did betray the Fort. Friskin. Ah, Seignior! if you could have betray'd it Your selfe, then we had been all made. Ramp. Well, no time lost, we may have occasion To betray somewhat hereafter; men that Will rise, must not be tender of Their labour and good will. Fibbia. Seignior, y'are in the right: For if we labour in our Calling, heaven Will helpe us to betray something or other For our good. Ramp. Mistresse Fibbia, I owe you For much profitable counsell. Fibbia. I, Sir, and money for other things. Ramp. Wee'll talke of that anon. Shew mee another Of thy standing that beares her yeeres like thee; It shall cost mee foure Duckets but I'll Get thy picture, and by thy side I'll have Young Antiphones thy sonne drawne too, Eating of Cherries in a green coat. Friskin. Seignior, this was the day you promis'd me. Ramp. I, I must talke with you; d'you heare, you shall Worke for the King. Friskin. Who? I Sir, alas! Ramp. Come, it must be so, his Taylor dy'd this morning. Friskin. I pray, Seignior. Hirco. 'Tis very true, He fell madde with studying of new fashions. Friskin. I shall be thankfull if you'll use your power. Ramp. You can i'th long vacation ev'ry yeere Travell to Paris, and instruct your selfe O'th newest modell, and best cut. Friskin. I have a brother lives there, Sir, he is A Shoe-maker, and lately sent me post A patterne of the finest Spur-leather; 'Twas so admir'd at Court. Ramp. Write for him straight, he shall be preferr'd too, If he bee kowne to trim at's pairing-knife, He cannot misse th'reversion of that place. Friskin. If the house of the Friskins rise, none of Your worthy issue shall want a second. Fibbia. Seignior, my money's due since Lammas last; Shall I know your mind? Ramp. Sweet Mistresse Fibbia, you shall receive our whole Discourse; I'm studying to preferre your neighbour here At Court. Now, if you'll choose any imployment In the Queens side, your hopes stand faire; she now Lies in at Mantua. Let me seeâwhat thinke You of a Rockers place to the young Prince? Fibbia. Why truly, Sir, so I may carry my Small sonne a long, I would be loth to leave him Behind in a lone house. Ramp. You must buy him a new Hat; and d'you heare, Let him abstaine from Ginger-bread, 'twill spoyle His growth. Fibbia. A little, Sir, on holy dayes. Ramp. You will be selfe-will'd. Fibbia. He alwayes had a care of my sonne. Ramp. Friskin, and you may visit me to morrow, And know more. Friskin. I'll bring my measure with me, it is long Since I wrought for your worship. Ramp. Doe, doe, farewell; Hirco, make haste, and shift the ayre; There's nothing so contagious as the breath Of Creditors.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Morello, Altophil, Arthiopa. Altophil. Rich hangings of the anticke Persian Loome, Venetian Tapers guilt, and bedding of Italian Nunnes imbroaderie, purl'd and imboss'd. Galeotto shewes his bountie great to decke Our Bridall chamber, with such forraigne pomp; But where's the Priest, that with his holy words Should make us fit to enter here? Morello. Rosting the Pigge he receiv'd in his last tythes. Altophil. Your mirth is somewhat strange; does it become you? Morello. How little are you prais'd in th'affaires And soules of men, to thinke this sumptuous bed Within, and furniture could entertaine An enemie? Altophil. For whom was it prepar'd? Morello. For mighty Heildebrand, the Lombards King, Who, when hee gave the Prince, and you secure Undoubted prisoners to my Masters will, He had a promise made, the ensuing night He should enjoy that Lady in his armes. Arthiopa. Ah mee! what prodigies are here? Altophil. Villaine, take that for thy intelligence.â Strikes him. Morel. So fierce in your rewards! what! how, seize on the Duke?â Enter souldiers, lay hold on him. tie his offensive armes, the Lady too! Altophil. My sense is so much dull'd with often use Of my calamities, that they are now Become my sport; what followes, Sir? I doe Beseech you would proceed. Morello. Souldiers, avoyd the roome.â Exeunt souldiers. Know, Sir, the wise Galeotto to make full Witty and new his bounty to the King, Ordain'd that you this Lady's Lover, should Upon your knees present her to his Iust: Your proud neglect of Amaranta then Is subtilly repay'd. Altophil. O! damn'd infernall Dog. Morello. I'll leave you, Sir, take leisure, and resolve T'accept of this imployment, or to die.â Exit. Altophil. How divers are the changes of his tyrannie; Erewhile he flatter'd us with pleasant shewes Of comfortable hope; then suddenly Presents us with more horrid formes then death. Arthiopa. Death is our happiest expectation now; The grave is ever quiet, though 'tis cold; But Altophil, alas! when wee have slept A many thousand yeeres; who is't can tell If I againe shall know thee when I wake?â Exit Amaranta. Amaran. The chiefest blessings that are bred above Fall on you both; like Summer showers that come To ripen what before was but i'th infancie Of growth: First, Altophil, on you that are Most noble to the world, though much behind To mee; next on your Bride, whose vetues shine So cleare, that I must checke my envie, and Pretend some joy to see her fortunate. Altophil. Can this be Amaranta's voyce? is shee Perverted too, and taught to mocke at our Distresse? Arthiopa. This ill beseemes a Maidens tendernesse. Amaranta. Forbid it goodnesse; if you suffer ought, That I should make your miseries my scorne; For just heaven knowes, my father with great shewes Of kindnesse, and of hope lately disturb'd My Orisons, with newes hee had design'd The Prince to marry me, which, Altopil, Was but unwelcome hope, since my best Love Must die with thy disdaine; then told me all These preparations were to celebrate Your Nuptialls with Arthiopa. Altophil. My Nuptiall Rites! this was a feign'd disguise To hide his foule lascivious purpose from Thy bashfull sight. Amar. My Lord, though he hath wrong'd you much, do not Misconstrue him as fit for all impieties. Altophil. Alas! it is too drie A truth; witnesse these bonds, witnesse those griefes That hang upon Arthiopa like blacke Wet clouds upon the mornings cheeke; know she Is here design'd for th'lust of Heildebrand: And I by your obdurate fathers will, Must be inforc'd to see and suffer it. Amaranta. Horror! why should I tarry here, And listen to such things as are not fit To be believ'd? Altophil. Stay Amaranta, stay; If thou art pitifull, and hast that heaven Within thy heart, that with such lively truth Is figur'd in thy face, expresse it now. Thou knowest the secret passages and doores Of this thy fathers house, convey with thy Best skill; and trust my Mistresse to some darke Unusuall place, where she may rest secure And safe from violence. Arthiopa. Upon my knees I begge If yet the softnesse of thy mothers nature Have any residence within thy breast: Looke like a Virgin on a Virgins moane; And let thy mercy finde some way to hide My honour from the reach of wicked men. Altophil. This sad necessity hath made my joynts Stiffned with Winter-marches in the war, Now supple as a Courtiers knee, that waits Upon a Tyrants Throne. Behold how low I fall to be my Mistresse advocate.â Amarant. Let me henceforth in darknesse dwell; for why Should I againe make use of day, that could Endure to see th'elected Monarch of My vassall'd Love, thus humbled at my feet? Rise, Sir, rise sweet Arthiopa, though it Seemes strange (though you my Rivall are) I should Assist your fortune, whose felicity Must ruine mine; yet I will justly doe't With hazard of my life. Altophil. What strange malicious courtesie (you starres) Was this? to make the first election of My love so excellent, and with Arthiopa, So fill my breast, that there no roome was left To entertaine the Ladies true Affection, till it came too late. Arthiopa. And I could not confirme My owne chiefe happinesse; but whilst I foyld The chaste proceedings of her hope. Amar. First, I'll untie these mis-becomming bonds,â Unbinds them. Now, follow mee with slow and wary feet, Strong guards are severally dispers'd beneath; You cannot voyd the house; but there's a vault Deepe buried under yonder Turrets frame, Where I'll conceale you both, 'till I perswade My father cease his irreligious wrath. Altophil. This kindnesse to thy Rivall shall become (In all succeeding times) a story fit To soften ev'ry amorous Ladies eare; Fame loud shall sing it, and preserve it long, The musicke of her trumpet, not her tongue.â Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter Heildebrand, Galeotto. Heildebrand. These ornaments shew much magnificence And wealth, the prosperous Monarch of the East Might here vouchsafe to sleepe, though when his bold And superstitious fables made him thinke The Sunne was marryed, and would send his glistring wife To be his Concubine. Galeotto. These Tapers, Sir, And these refulgent Stones, will all grow darke, When you behold Arthiopa; who now (That you may find my promise just) you shall Embrace; where is shee? ha, death on this slave. Morello told me that he left her here; Her Lover too, fast bound to my dispose.â Enter Amaranta. Amaranta! what divell counsell'd thee To this untimely visit in the night? Amaranta. It was a carefull Angell, Sir, that to Prevent the dangers on your soule, hath given Me order to dehort your rage, which so Pursues Arthiopa. Galeotto. Where is shee? speake, Where's Altophil? remov'd and hid by thee? Heildebr. Her beauties make his faint description more Like envie then just praise; the nicest maid In Lombardy, strictly compar'd, lookes like A wither'd Lapland Nurse; my teeming wife Shewes foule and tauny to her, as sh'ad beene The footy off-spring of a Moore. Galeot. Why do'st not speake, I know she can't escape The confines of my house, my guards are made Too watchfull and too strong, Where is she? Speake.â Shee kneeles. Amaranta. Sir, I confesse I've hid her from your wrath, And till this great distemper of your mind is cur'd, It were not safe she should appeare. Heildebr. Galeotto, Why do'st let this Lady kneele? Such humblenesse shewes ill, the pleasure of An am'rous beauty is her pride. Galeot. The posture's comely, Sir, it is my daughter. Heildebr. Hah! his daughter! this courtesie is new And exquisite, I love a Parent for my Bawd! Galeotto. Tell mee, thou troublesome delight of holinesse; Where thy bewitching Rivall is conceal'd, Or I'll torment thee till thou wake thy dead Unluckie mother with thy groanes. Heildebr. Galeotto, hold, do'st thou use force? Galeot. The Lady that I promis'd for your solace, Sir, S'hath wickedly remov'd from hence. Heildebr. What Lady's that? Galeot. The faire Arthiopa. Heildebr. There is none faire but she, all beauty else She turnes to blacke companions of the night; My judgement is too strong, cheat not mine eares With the false musicke of a name: Alas! My gentle Excellence, waste not those teares, Whose soveraigne power would better nature, where She weakly doth reside, and falling in The Spring, convert a Canker to a Rose. Come, mourne no more. Amaranta. Sir, you are mercifull, And by the great prerogative of your Command, may soone procure an easier weight Then he hath laid upon the innocent. Heildebr. Believe't he shall not practise violence; To Bed sweet beauty, goe, he is reclaim'd; Upon thy life pursue her not: thy lookes Are grown too terrible to court her now.â Exit Amaranta. Galeotto. But will you then forgoe my promise, Sir? Heildebr. Your first assurance was, her Love should Present her willingly into mine armes, And that I must expect there is no ease, Nor pleasure in restraint. Galeotto. You meane Arthiopa. I'll fetch her, Sir, if you'll but let me force This wayward foole to tell where shee's conceal'd. Heildebr. This is that faire Arthiopa whom I'll enjoy. Galeotto. Perswade my daughter to your bed; alas, you Are marryed, Sir. Heildebr. Or thy ambition else Were happily so bold to thinke: I'll choose Her for my wife. Galeotto. In troth the other way Is but unwholesome kinde of love; Yet may be fit enough for lost Arthiopa; If you'll take leisure 'till I finde her out: But to betray a daughter. Heildebr. You lately could betray Your countrey, Sir, why not a daughter now? Mocke not my rais'd desires, bring her to night; Not forc'd by terror, or outragious strength, But by the soothings of thy tongue wrought to A willing, liberall consent; goe, do't, Or thou shalt bleed.â Exit. Galeotto. Peace to your majesty: This foole in a religious pity hath Destroy'd her selfe, i'th choycest houre of time, When I design'd she should be wedded to The Prince: for dull loose Heildebrand, If th'other had but satisfi'd his lust, In drunken bountie would surrender all His conquest here, t'endow and make her great. What is our humane cunning, our obscure And vicious wisdome worth? since at this play Of policie, that Gamester cannot winne That hath not skill, but power to help his sinne.â Exit. Enter Ascoli unbound, Rangone, Gandolpho. Rangone. I heare the Lady, Sir, and Altophil Are pris'ners still, and by that traytor were But led to counterfeit delights. Ascoli. My owne calamities soone vanish from My thoughts, when I remember theirs; you see This Captaine gives my hands their liberty; But expect hee's now so farre restor'd, That hee'll contrive the freedome of My person and my minde. Rangone. Gandolpho, know The counsell I have breath'd, will shortly, when Your reason and your piety consult, Advance your profit much, your honour more. Ascoli. Your error past I have forgiven; as well Assur'd Galeotto's cunning did seduce Your easie nature in pretence of gratitude To doe perfidious things to th'State and mee; But your amendment now shall have as full Reward as if the memory were lost, Of all your former guilt. Rangone. How excellent repentance shewes! it may, Perhaps, proceed too slow, but when 'Tis reall, never comes too late. Gandolph. Sir, thus dejected on the earth, I begge Your pardon, and should rise made happy, though Not innocent, if you believe that I Was wrought into my crime, by him that found A subtile use of my unskilfull Love. Ascol. My faith is willingly confirm'd, and you Call'd backe to all the favour you forsooke; The Citadell continues still in your Command, though with bold strangers new inforc'd; And by your power a secret entrance may Be soone devis'd for a surprize. Rangone. The absence of your person, Sir, which is So much lamented now, when you appeare, Will adde a courage equall to the joy Our souldiers shall receive; and though dispers'd, The towne may yeeld enough for this designe. Gandolpho. What valour, or long practise in the war (Made perfect with much doubtfull enterprize) Can doe, we shortly will atchieve: but for A while you must rest close in durance here. Ascoli. My patience is so wise, it will perswade Me to't, Rangone, come; the dangers which These Lovers feare, are such as we would faine Prevent, or else adventure to revenge.â Exeunt. Enter Heildebrand, Galeotto, Arthiopa. Galeot. The beames of your bright beautie could not be So hid, but I must finde them out. Arthiopa. My life I now esteeme not worthy of my care, Since you have sever'd mee from Altophil. Galeot. Your Lover yet is safe; but if you use The King with cruelty, expect the like On him.âI knew, when he beheldâ aside. Her lustre shine, my Amaranta would Be free; already he growes hot: This fire Like those that Chymists keepe, must still In secret burne, whilst gazers voyd the roome.â Exit. Heildebr. Which way shall I redeeme the error of My former wonder, that in ignorance. Committed fond Idolatrie to one Who in her greatest beauty may become Thy worshipper, and not decline her owne Prerogative; though shee excell a throng On others that are comely too. Altophil. Sir, I am hither forc'd By a perverse and trecherous Counsellor; His tongue hath much envenom'd your chaste cares, And would perswade you a horrid sinne; But all my comfort is, your nature hath Been still so rightly taught, you'll easily Resist temptations of greater strength, Heildebr. Know thou art hither come, to lay thy white Attractive hand upon my Scepter; and Give lawes to me, to make decrees of war And peace; fold up my Ensignes, then command, Then straight unfold agen, untill they spread Their bloodie streamers in a forraigne Land; But then my pretious sweetnesse you must love. Arthiop. Your goodnesse, Sir, I will, but if your thoughts Are prompted to attempt unlawfull deeds, Sure all the righteous world must hate you then; Nor would I be the last should frowne upon A wicked Lover, though a King. Heildebr. Such cold discourse befits an hermitage, Where age and hunger make a rev'rend Pretence, to hate the pleasure, when (alas) They have out-liv'd the appetite; you must Come neerer yet.â Arthiop. O! thinke upon your honour, Sir, and what Protects it, heaven. Heildebr. It is some pleasure to Delay those thoughts a while, draw neere, make mee Acquainted with your lips; why should they want Impression that so easily swell; that are So soft, and fit to take the seale of love? Arthiop. You'll fright my soule from this unfortunate Weake Tenement, where she unwillingly Hath dwelt of late; and now 'tis shaken so With that strong tempest in your lookes, She dares not longer stay. Heildebr. Let her come forth, and in my bosome rest. Arthiop. No, Sir, her second dwelling is above The stars, where she will tell such tales of you, If you persist, the earth shall grow too hot For your abode, and shortly after, hell Too cold; they'll mend, and multiply their fires Against you come. Heildebr. Were you lesse faire, such coynesse would disswade. Arthiop. If you continue in this exercise Of impious power, be still a King; but may You live to know, your title given you for A scorne, no subjects left you to obey; More enemies to conquer what you have, 'Till be so little, and so cheape; this in Your age, when miseries doe most perplex, And strength is quite decay'd that should support The waight which younger patience thinks no load. Heildebr. Are you so excellent at curses, Lady? Arthiop. But better far at blessings, Sir; if you Subvert the furious danger of your will, Be still a King; and may your Scepter grow Within your hand, as heaven had given it A root: may it bud forth, increase in boughes, Till't spread to the Platan tree, and yeeld A comfortable shade, where other Kings May sit delighted, and secure from all The stormes of war and tyrannie. Heildebrand. Leave me, away, That closet make your prison untill night, Where you shall harbour safe from him that would Betray your Virgin-wealth, but looke not backe: For then you share the guilt of my next crime, You carrie in your face the fire that feeds My flame; which, if I see, 'twill kindle soone What I will strive to quench.â Exeunt severall wayes. Enter Altophil bound agen. Altophil. Arthiopa, Arthiopa! O that The double concave of this dismall place Could but reverberate her name, I would Be mock'd, though with a sound of happinesse Rather then quite depriv'd; the Ghosts Of impious men walke and revisit the Relinquish'd earth; but she is gone like things Most excellent: the soules of Votaries Who once departed, know this fulsome world So much unfit to mingle with their pure Refin'd ayre, that they will returne. Arthiopa,â Enter Amaranta, with a sword drawne. Amaranta. What voyce is that, which with Such fatall accent doth bemone some great Eternall losse. Altophil. Arthiopa is gone, The secret Vault where thou didst leave us safe Enclos'd was by Morello found, who with Rude help of murthers enforc'd her from Mine armes, and left mee bound. Amaranta. I fear'd some danger neer Which made mee haste to thy redresse; once more (My Lord) let me give freedome to your strength.â Unbinds him. Here, take this sword, 'tis a most pretious jewell, And like a relique hath hung long within Our armourie: if false Morello shall Returne to threaten death, defend your selfe. Altophil. I would this bountie had been earlyer brought. Amaranta. My feares are so increas'd, I dare not stay To see the end of thy uncertaine fate. Be watchfull and conceal'd.â Exit. Altophil. The unwearied courtesies Of this soft maid, afflict my memorie: Since my affections were so far bequeath'd And spent, ere they became her due, that now I cannot pay her, equall love for love, But to anothers losse.âWhat noyse is that! A second doore reveal'd? it opens too.â He steps behind the Arras. Enter Galeotto, Morello. Morello. Hee's truss'd, and pinion'd like a Pullet, Sir, And you may spit him when you please. Galeot. Yes, he must die, for Amaranta loves Him so, her wishes else will ne're be quieted, Nor she admit the Prince, though I could win His heart, he suffers for disdaine of her; She shall appeare, and see it too, 'twill breed Her up to greatnesse, whose chiefe nourishment Is blood, when you have lock'd the doore, give her This key, and send her hither. Morello. If shee suspect the cause, she will not come. Galeot. I say she must, and wait you close about The King, to watch th'event of his hot enterprize.â Exit Morello. Duke Altophil, where is your mighty grace? Altophil. Who is't that makes my title his bold mirth? Galeotto. His fetters off! a sword too in his hand! This argues trecherie.â Strives to goe backe to the doore, Altophil steps betweene. Altophil. Nay, no retyring yet, I have been here reserv'd your prisoner, But your dull bounty now hath made you mine. Galeot. The very sword I won in duell from The fain'd La Roch, i'th vale of Chamberis,, If 'twere taught t'observe as Wizards doe, This chance is so sinister, 'twould infuse A superstitious trembling through my veines. Altophil. What is it makes your admiration still Employ'd? this object of your crueltie? Galeotto. Who furnish'd thee with such a rich defence For rescue of thy life? Altophil. Your daughter, Sir. Galeot. So true to him that hates her! and so false To me! destruction on her soule. Altophil. Your curse will find such little entertainment where Her vertues are, that it must soone returne Unto your selfe; the memory of her Would faine disswade my just revenge on thee. Where hast thou left Arthiopa? Galeotto. With Heildebrand. Altophil. That fatall word calls backe my absent and Relenting spirits to my arme, which grew With thoughts of mercy weake, but now it hath A strength too dangerous for thy repulse.â They fight a while, and part. Galeotto. Yo'are active, Sir, your nimble joynts are bath'd In Jessamine oyle. Altophil. And you are knowne a Master in This angry Art; your Rapier miracles Are chronicled by the hot fencing French; But I'll adventure some small practice, Sir.â fight agen and sever. Galeot. Pause, pause a while, and keepe your little breath, Since 'tis your last, to make your friend more sport. Altophil. So merry? cause your divell is so learn'd, And taught you faigne in subtile lines, Proportion'd by a rule; still statue like, Standing as stiffe as if your posture were In Brasse, I'll discompose it straight.â Fight agen, Galeotto is wounded, they sever. Galeot. I did not thinke your skill so excellent, I shall drop downe without revenge, hence with A Hatchet, like a senslesse tree, this to Requite your kindnesse, Sir.â Fight, Galeotto, is wounded, agen. they sever. Altophil. Laugh and be merry now; You are not tickled with a straw, you see, This is a kind of sport will make you bleed. Galeot. O my false fame, where art thou now, he bores And drills me where he list, as I were dead Already, and my breast, a boord us'd to An Augur, not a Sword; as if hee had Forecast how many holes would serve to make My obscure heart transparent to the world. The Furies greet you, Sir.â Fight, Galeotto falls. Altophil. This for my much wrong'd Prince, this for Arthiopa.â And though a glorious villaine, yet like to A villaine fall, despis'd upon the earth; Not pitied in thy parting Grove. Galeot. O! O! your wrath and I together end.â Hee dies. Altophil. 'Tis strange I scap'd without a wound, he was A cunning duellist, whose tread is that?â Enter Amaranta. Amaranta. Feare still makes others swift to flie from danger, And me thus slow t'incounter it, sure I Have stay'd too long, where are you, Sir? Altophil. Sweet Amaranta, hide thine eyes. Amaranta. Can they be weary growne of seeing you? Altophil. But here's another object that will make them start, Till they untie their strings. Amaranta. Hah my father! mercie, how far is thy White throne remov'd from earth, that wretched I, Thy daily Orator, could not be heard? My blood will turne to teares at his dire Obsequie. O Altophil! thou cruell Lord, did I For this with severall hazards of my life, And filiall faith, keepe thee from death? that sword I gave you for defence, and straight Perverting all my courtesies, you did Present it to my fathers breast. Altophil. Hee was a wicked man. Amarant. Were thy uncivill accusations true; Yet for my sake thou might'st have spar'd his life: For mee, whom though you could not love, I ne're deserv'd to find your hatred in Such fierce extremes. Altophil. There was no help, but one Of us must fall, and I preserv'd my selfe. Amaranta. Upon such wise sure cautions, my Indulgent nature scorn'd to meditate, When I deliver'd you from murthering hands, But made the danger hastily mine owne. Altoph. Those words like subtill lighting pierce, and soone Will kill me, though they make no wound. Here, take this sword, revenge thy fathers cause, Revenge thy cause, whose love I have been forc'd To pay with some neglect, kill me and be just.â Amaranta. Did you but call't neglect? and said that you Were forc'd to it? Altophil. So forc'd, as I shall ever be, since my First plight was seal'd; there is no ease, no end Of that constraint. Amaranta. Still to lament, and never to be lov'd.â Altophil. I am the source of all thy griefe; make haste, 'Tis fit I die.â Amaranta. That sentence is my doome.â Shee falls on the sword. Altophil. Hold, Amaranta, hold; Where are our better Angells at such times As these? Sweet virgin breathe a while.â Amarant. Goe, tell Arthiopa she needs not feare Her rivall now, my Bridall bed is in The earth. Altophil. O stay! there may be helpe. Amaranta. When you come neer my grave, if any flower Can grow on such unluckie ground, pray water't with A single teare, that's all I aske: mercy heaven.â She dies. Altophil. For ever gone! make much of her you stars, She is the brightest ere shall come into Your numberlesse societie. Her last Salute was sent unto Arthiopa, Till shee be safe I must not follow thee; But I will hasten, gentle maid, to weare Immortall wings, and thy new lustre then Will be so knowne above, that if I stray, It can direct and light mee in the way.â Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Enter Ascoli, Altophil. Ascol. Whil'st we confine our motion to this darke Division of the house, we are secure; The Guards beneath Rangone did corrupt, And made my entrance hither easily Atchived: but thou hast told a piteous tale, The latter part will give posterity A lasting cause to mourne, for though Galeotto suffered justly for his crimes, And I must ever praise that victory; Yet Amaranta's fate was most severe. Altophil. Alas! it is not good to name her, Sir; We shall but spoyle our thoughts, and urge them to A desperate beliefe. Ascol. Can your intelligence Aime at no report that may declare Your Mistresse usage with the King? Altophil. As passages are stopp'd, no souldiers voyce Is louder then a whisper here, and those Are breath'd in the darke.â Enter Arthiopa, her haire hanging loose about her. Ascoli. Looke where shee comes. Altophil. If that be shee That gives her sorrow so much ornament With haire dishevell'd, and unwilling lookes, Declin'd with sighs that well may penetrate The spacious vault of heaven, though it were Arch'd With Onix and hard Chrysolite; If that be she, perswade your selfe to know Her, Sir, for I would faine preserve her still A stranger to my sight. Arthiopa. I came to seeke Thee Altophil, but thou art found too soone. Why should I vex a Lovers tendernesse? My lamentations are so great, they'ld serve T'infuse a vertue in a furious eare, If pitie may be call'd a vertue, but I hope it is not so, for then the world Would much offend, that long hath wanted it. Altophil. What dismall story hangs upon thy tongue? Speake it aloud, to wake the destinies, Who sure are fast asleep, thy sufferance else Will make us thinke they take no care of what They can so easily create. Arthiopa. Fierce Heildebrand, That tyrant King! O! that my memory Can keepe a name should be forgot by all The world! Ascoli. He finds our militarie soules are now Growne tame, and meeke as Doves; hee'll shortly use No Iron Scepter here, wee can be aw'd And govern'd by a Reed. Arthiopa. To this perfidious King I was convey'd By Galeotto, falser then himselfe, Endur'd his sinfull courtship, and subdu'd At first with threatning vowes, the furie of His will; so that he seem'd restor'd to grace. Altophil. And did hee fall agen? Arthiopa. His pietie Grew soone too high a blisse for him, With tedious steps he labour'd up the hill; Whose top being reach'd, his elevation shew'd So strange, that it amaz'd his ignorance, And giddily he tumbled downe in far Lesse space then he could climbe. Ascoli. A swift inconstancie. Arthiopa. In a short moment hee was quite Declin'd from good, ev'n to the extacie of vice: For in the blackest and most guiltie houre Of night, hee came and found my curtaines drawne; But so uncomely rude were his intents, That though I there had slept as in a Shrine, (A place which death or holinesse did priviledge With reverend esteeme) yet he would force His way; you sacred powers conceive how fit It is the rest should make mee dumbe. Altophil. I have begun In blood, and must goe on; inhumane guilt Is so disperss'd and growne so strong, that now Revenge from every valiant hand will be Acknowledged lawfull and Divine. Ascoli. Let's hasten to our furious businesse, come, I have some strength in ambush neere the Fort; And bold Rangone waits within t'expect What hidden troopes I will command t'assault My Palace which this Monster hath usurp'd. Altophil. That charge conferre upon my care; Away, let's give him swift and silent death, Like Cannons, that destroy ere they are heard: Yet since we're sever'd in our enterprize, Wee'll take a solemne leave for ever, Sir. Farewell,âour usuall fortune can perswade Us to no better confidence. Ascoli. Yes, noble Altophil, Wee'll meet agen, I'll find thee, though i'th clouds. Altophil. I have of late been so much us'd To weepe, that I suspect the chrystall of Mine eyes is but a kind of Ice, which still Each warmer change of weather straight doth thaw. Ascoli. The sweetest, though most injur'd of thy sex, Farewell, and thinke such comfort yet remaines, As must not be despis'd, though but in hope. Arthiop. Sir, reason soone would ruine mine, if I Had any left; the cleane nice Ermine not Endures to live, when once the Hunter doth Her whitenesse soyle, though with a little staine. Altophil. Arthiopa, come, we are lovers still, Though too too much unfortunate; time ne're Could finde in all his old records, nor will The like succeed in's future Register.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Brusco, Gandolpho, Rampino, Hirco. Brusco. What lazie Elephants are these? huge Rogues That cannot dig through mould as soft as dough. Ramp. Is not the Myne yet finish'd? Gandolph. Have patience Gentlemen, I'm confident Th'ave reach'd off the Parapet, And straight the powder will be laid. Ramp. But is the ambush well supply'd that should Breake in upon the Garrison when fire is given? Brusco. Those follow my direction, and are all Prepar'd to execute at their just time. Hirco. Then one successe is sure, for the old troopes Have sent a private message, they'll assault The City gates before the Sunne can rise To shew them to the enemy. I know th'are led by brave Pisciero the Lievtenant to our Generall, and I Have planted those will give them entrance, though They tread upon their mothers and their wives. Brusco. It recreates my very lungs to thinke How this luxurious stupid Heildebrand In pleasure snorts, and little thinks He shall be wak'd with an alarme. Gandolpho. You, Sir, must take important care, lest in The streets your consultation be with throngs Of Fiends: for busie members will be soone Observ'd; your quarter is the Westerne bridge. Brusco. But first attend about the Palace, to Expect your orders, they must be given you there. Rampino. Direct your selves; I am more watchfull then A sicke Constable after his first sleepe On a cold bench, Hirco, along with mee.â Exeunt omnes. Enter Heildebrand, Morello, Rangone. Morello. This is the Count Rangore, Sir, who was Before your Conquest here chiefe Captaine of The Guard unto the captive Prince. Heildebr. From Galeotto, Sir, is your affaire? Rangone. This Ring hee humbly sends a present toâ Ring Your Majesty, it was the first rich pledge You gave him to confirme his new integritie, By which he would perswade your royall thoughts; I am a messenger of trust, with hope It may procure me privately your eare. Heildebr. Leave us, Morello, and attend withinâ Exit Morello. What is the cause hee can so soone neglect The homage of his dutie here? he did Not waite to day. Rangone. His daughter, Sir, is sicke. O're whom so fondly he laments, that hee Supplies both her Physitians Art and diligence. Heildebr. Proceed to his request. Rangone. Your wisdome, Sir, wee'll much admire. To what a calme and easie sufferance He hath reduc'd Arthiopa reclaim'd Her frostie nature to such warme, such soft And feminine desires as it is fit Her beautie should possesse. Heildebr. Thou dost bewicth me with thy newes. Rangone. Sir, she no more retaines the seeming forwardnesse And peevish rigour of a maid, But wonders why the Roman Lucrece did Complaine, because enforc'd since boldly she Concludes it now the onely subtill way To compasse pleasure without sinne. Heildebr. Wise Aracmes Philosophy, hee'd read It to his Neece. Rangone. No question, Galeotto had Good moderne Authors for his Doctrine, Sir, Else 'twould not thrive so well: his instant suite Unto your greatnesse is, you would prepare To humble your occasions to this night, As you may visit him; and you shall find The Lady alter'd to your wish. Heildebrand. It lay not in the power of all his skill And vigilance, to send me a request I would so willingly receive: this glad Assurance render him with my best thanks, And then returne to be my guide.â Exeunt. Enter Rampino, Hirco. Ramp. Stay here, and watch for more supplies; the word Is gone about, I've drawne to our confederacie From an obscure blind lane, a race of such Indebted wights, as have not seen the Sunne Since the last great eclipse, when wonder more Than businesse brought them out. Hirco. Have they any clothes? Ramp. Why, dost thou thinke they goe to play a Prize? Is't of necessity they must appeare In scarlet Breeches, and cleane lac'd shirts? Swords they have all, although their scabbards are A little torne about the Chape, they'll serve To poke; lesse men are squeamish, and won't let'em Enter their bodies, because they are rustie. Hirco. I would not be a Serjeant in their way. Ramp. Straight when the hurry shall begin to rise, Beware my Gossip Goldsmiths shop; there be Among us that will drinke our mornings draughts In plate, without asking how much an ounceâ Enter Friskin. Hirco. Looke there, you must weare an invisible Ring. Enter Heildebrand, Rangone. Rangone. He said I should receive the Lady here; 'Tis strange he failes: if Sir, it will become Your greatnesse to expect a while, I'll seeke Galeotto out, and sent her hither. Heildebr. The object may deserve my patience, but take care Y'are swift in your returne. Rangone. If wishes can Conduce prosperity to the designe, Thou shalt not want them, Altophil, I'll guard The gates below to hinder all impediments.â Exit, strange musicke is heard above. Heildebr. This sure is some preparative, although The sound's not very amorous. The Song to a horrid tune. (1.) You Fiends and Furies come along, With Iron Crow and massie Prong; Come, drag your shackles and draw neere, To stirre a huge old Sea-coale Cake, That in our hollow hell did bake, Many a thousand thousand yeere. (2.) In Sulhp'rous broth Tereus hath boy'ld, Basted with Brimstone, Tarquin hath broy'ld Long, long enough, then make more roome Like smoakie flitches hang them by Vpon our sootie walls to drie, A greater ravisher will come. (3.) If you want fire, fetch a supply, From Ãtna and Puteoli, Yet stay a while, you need not stirre, Since if his glowing eyes shall chance, To cast on Proserpine a glance, He is so hot hee'll ravish her.â Enter Altophil. Heildeb. My senses are growne sicke! speake! what art thou? Altophil. Men call mee Altophil. Heildebr. Hee I encounter'd in a battell on The banks of Sibaris? I'll rather meet Thee in that river, stemming against The tide, then thus wall'd in where horror dwells. I am betray'd!â Altophil. Stirre not, you are confin'd, And cannot scape me now; for such events. As are prescrib'd us in the secret booke Above, here wee shall both receive. Heildebr. I feare not mine, my single valour is Enough, if thou art all mine enemies. Altophil. You come to visit Galeotto, Sir:â Drawes the hangings. See where he rudely sits ill manner'd Lord, That will not rise to welcome such a Potentate. Heildebr. Sleeping in death! such nodding likes me not. Altophil. Survey him well; he was your Traytor, Sir, Goe hug him now; cherish the falshood that Could ruine States, and draw a Nation to Captivity; open his head, where all His plots and policies are treasur'd up, And take them out, it is not fit such wealth Should lie conceal'd i'th grave. Heildebr. Is there no more Remaining of those sweating toyles, danger, And studious wit that helps ambition to Ascend, then such a pale complexion and a cold dumb mockery of what we were? Altophil. Now, Sir, to entertaine your pretious time With new variety (although I knew You are in haste) see Amaranta here.â Drawes the hangings further. Heildebr. She so alter'd and growne silent too? Altophil. This was a noble beauty once; repleat With all that gentle ornament Lovers In their kind passion, or Poets in Diviner fury could advance with praise. And this so sanctifi'd a thing, you did Endeavour to corrupt, pray court her now, And thrid her teares like orientall Pearle, Take Rubies from her lips to darken all The Jewells in your Crowne, y've undertooke So much in counterfeit Hyperbole's, Blast her faire hand with your false sighs; and sweare 'Tis no Idolatry, you may; for looke How like a Goddesse a dead Lady shewes. Heildebr. I'll see no more; if they are fit for monuments, Why were they not interr'd before I came? Altophil. Yes, you must needs behold all that is gay And pleasing here; 'twill make your welcome seeme More absolute: come forth Arthiopa.â Enter Arthiopa, her haire dishevell'd as before. Heildebr. This living spectacle disturbs, and frights My senses more then all that's dismall 'bout The dead; no traytor like to that within, My courage failes me now, which till this houre I trusted most. Altophil. Looke on the ruines you Have made of such a building; Cherubims Would strive to dwell in it, but that they knew They must dispossesse a soule as good as they; see how it droops! Heildebr. The period of My vex'd injurious life drawes on apace. Atophil. Prepare your valour and your sword, for love Unto the sacred title which you beare. You shall not die surpriz'd, without defence, But try what usefull strength is left you, now Your vertue's gone.â Both draw. Heildebr. Stay then, I'll call to my remembrance all The noble deeds of my heroicke youth, Whilst growing mighty with thoughts, I may Behave my selfe as if I had no guilt. Arthiopa. O hold my Lord! why should you hazard thus The treasure of your life? impoverishing the needy remnant of the vertuous world In my revenge, leave it to th'holy powers. Heildebr. Wilt thou be courteous to her, and desist? Altophil. Move but a little backe, Arthiopa, Couldst thou believe me worthy of thy love, Yet doubt my fortitude t'encounter him, Whose crimes have left him no assistant but What came from Hell; all that is good forsooke Him when hee injur'd thee.â Arthiopa. 'Tis wearisome to beg your safety now. Altophil. By all the fervour of our mutuall vowes, I charge thee give me liberty to try What anger can performe when it is just. Arthiop. I cannot disobey, though when I see Your dangers I can die.â Heildebr. I am resolv'd for thy assault, yet stay, That Ladies suffrings hang so heavie on My soule, that it foretells a longer sleepe Then I would willingly begin; I wish Thou couldst prepare me with a little wound, That might let out my lustfull blood, and leave The rest to strengthen me for this dire cause.â Altophil. I'm good at opening of a veine; there Sir,â They fight, Heildebrand falls. Heild. Had that afflicted terror in her face Bin hid, 'th'adst found more trouble in this victory.â I feele desires of blisse, and those I hope May prosper, though presented very late.â hee dies. Altophil. Depart, forgotten and forgiven.â Arthiopa. Why dost thou shrinke? speake Altophil: why dost Thou bow like tyr'd undweeldie age? Altophil. His sword has bin too busie here, just here About the heart.â Arthiopa. The Region of thy love, I finde thou hast a wound by perfect sympathie, For mine growes sicke, and doth desire to bleed. Altophil. How fares my Mistresse? sweet Arthiopa? Arthiopa. Your pulse must give account of all my health. Altophil. Take't not unkindly I shall leave thee now, My eyes grow dimme, and I would furnish them With everlasting light. Arthiopa. O my deare Lord! Let me not thinke that voyce was yours. Altophil. Alas! that in a loyall Lover death Must argue some inconstancie, since 'tis The first occasion to forsake what wee May ne're enjoy agen I shall not be forsaken; for I feele I can decay apace, and keepe you company In this long journey to our last abode.â Altophil. First let's seeke our vowes upon our lips, They were so strictly kept, that wee shall find Them warme, as if but newly breath'd.â They kisse. These are the funerall rites of love.â Arthiopa. Breake heart. It is the way to shew that thou wert trueâ They both die. Within. Victory! the Fort is taken, victory!â Enter Ascoli, Rangone, Gandolpho, Rampino, Brusco, Hirco, and the Guard. Ascoli. Your brother dy'd, Gandolpho, in the first Retreat; you and the souldiers still shall share My best affection and felicity. Omnes.; Rangone. Long live your Highnesse. O Sir, the splendor of our triumphs are Eclips'd, wee came too late; behold, The Tyrant is not onely slaine, but here The valiant Generall lies, his Mistresse too, Imbracing, though insensible of love. Ascoli. Friendship and love are dead; I find My sorrowes are too mighty for my tongue. Rangone. The King thus sever'd from them it appeares He first was kill'd by Altophil, who straight Fell after on a lingring hurt, Arthiopa (This seene) could need no other wound than griefe. Brusco. The pride and comfort of the war is gone. Ramp. A Generall fit to leade the world against The force of Hell. Hirco. But now wee may hang up Our armes, and yeeld to ev'ry enemy. Rangone. Sir, though 'tis fit you mourne, yet take some care So to proceed, as that your Subjects may Be perfectly assur'd of our victory. Ascoli. Beare hence these wofull objects of our first True Elegie; thy statue, Altophil, Shall in my Palace stand, with sad Arthiopa Lamenting still; and Amaranta fix'd On th'other side, hiding her eyes, that found Too much of beauty in her Rivall's face; In lasting gold, by old Ephesian Art Design'd, this tripleâFigure I'll aduance, Though it will little credit adde to Fate, That made such Lovers so unfortunate.â Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Ovr Poet in his furie hath profest, Yet gravely too, with's hand upon his breast, That he will never wish to see us thrive, If by an unhumble Epilogue we strive To court from you that priviledge to day Which you so long have had to damne a Play: 'Las, Gentlemen, he knowes, to cry Playes downe Is halfe the businesse Termers have in towne; And still the reputation of their wit growes strong, As they can first contemne, bee't right or wrong, Your wives and Countrey friends may power exact To finde a fault or two in every Act: But you by his consent most kindly shall Enjoy the priviledge to raile at all: A happy freedome, which y'esteeme no lesse Then money, health, good wine, or Mistresses; And he, he hopes, when age declines his wit From this our stage; to sit and rule i'th pit; Heaven willingly, shall assume a Charter firme, As yours, to kill a Poet every Terme.
