      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE âDonec totum impleat orbem.â Saint-Vallier. A May evening: the chestnuts are in flower, and below them the thorns, still whiter; the grass is patterned over with daisies. A great stag passes among the boughs, through which his head alone is visible. A quarter of the moon now shows at the edge of a chestnut-tree. Then a lovely child, dressed in green and white, comes out of the boscage, stands and listens. Diane. No, no! She is not here! Should the old woman Creep from Saint-Vallier, nor have kept her word, She is not worth a shout nor an old song This woody month of May . . . A-ha! The smellâ Warmâof a little shrine! Madonna-month, And all its incense here. A slip of moon, And white flowers clouding round me and green grass, And dew beneath the daisiesâwe all waiting, Not as with any hope . . . it is more fresh! An old crone steals out from the under-darkness of the chestnuts Gipsy. My lucky lady, My saviour. . . . Ah, my lady, that I live, That your sweet voice over your father's harshness Has kept old Jeanne upon the earth to bless you! Ah, lady, lady! . . . You saved a head of snow, sweet head of gold! See, see, my head of snow! But you, child, shall be young, year in, year out; Till all your years fall you shall yet be young. Diane. Dame Jeanne, but I would be A woman, like my mother, Jeanne de Poytiers. It seems a rude, cold thing still to be young. Gipsy. The child! My beauty, Those gifts that come to bless are never known, Because the stars that are of night confer them, Or gods that are not of the night nor day! Stretch out your hand! By the pale Moon, your fingers Have crescent-points! Let mine play round these fingers . . . And hear old Jeanne. If you would guard your youthâ And youth is fugitive as yonder doe After the leading stagâthen guard my counsel: Plunge in the beautiful water of the dawn, Or in the fountain's pressing core of ice; Let the Moon shine upon an unsalved visage, Dim with the very warmth of sleep: forsake not The lustrous power of forests and of wealds, Their clear and eager sanctitude, the chase, The falcon balanced in the sky, All bold, fresh things, all rustle of clean life, The running of the hunted stag, the ardour Of the hounds' cry . . . pursue it to the depths Of echoes that have lost their depth, pursue it On to the rim of beauty, the recess Of beauty. Hunt, Hunt on in dream and slack not! Diane. In the pools I bathe, nor touch my skin with balm or unguent To make its freshness sting me less at night; I haunt the woods all day: and there is little, It seems, I yet must learn of gipsy lore, Except to cherish youth if time should come I long not to be older. Gipsy. Now, farewell, Diane, Diane! Diane. Why speak so lingeringly My name? Gipsy. The Moon sails forth above the trees: Full she has filled the worldâ Diane, my kiss! [The Gipsy embraces the child and goes out. Diane. Is she some mighty witch, This old Egyptian? How I am left lone, My name upon me as if newly named. [The great stag lifts his head close to her; she embraces his neck. There is plenitude of still moonlight. The hounds chime from the kennels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I Twenty years later Paris. Saint-Germain; Diane is seated in the embrasure of a window. She is dressed in deep mourning, and she weeps. Henri stands before her, silent; she raises her head. Diane. Take comfort, Prince. Henri. I will not for your tearsâ I will not. In the world there is no wrong Like this that you are weeping. SÃ©nÃ©chale, These tears must check; they fall on me at night, They lash me from my sleep as cruel storms, They beat upon me fiercely as the rain Beats on a flood. . . . In mercy, Seeing my sorrow is too much, my anger Too young to comfort you, let your fair eyes That can hold all things, as a flower Holds to itself its fragrance, hold their rain. Diane. Take comfort, Prince; your grief to me is sharper Than any of my own. Henri (stooping to the edge of her raiment and kissing it). You are white and black; you are a widow now. May I put on your colours? Not the white And green the poets singâI cannot sing; I am too full . . . it is not like a song. Give me your tears to dry them in my blood! Diane. To-morrow, at the tourney? No, my Prince. I am not wronged; mine is a widow's dule, Eternal, not to pass. You must not wear, Dauphin, the colours of eternal dule. Henri (springing closer to her). But I shall wear them constant as the habit Of a dead man to his shroud. Diane. To-morrow's favour? Henri. Constant as the habit Of a dead man to his shroud. I know that laughter Will greet my strong presumption, as a child, An acolyte, should in blank repetition Rehearse the Mass . . . and must it be your laughter? I am shy, flouted by the King; I have been many years in prison too; And many years I have been dumb: I thought that I was praying when I spoke. How still you sit! Diane. I am listening, Prince, to music. Henri. If you could sit like that and make no sign, But sit indifferent on, Like that, when presently I yield my soul For your glory at the jousts! You have a beauty That must not be dishevelledâin compassion Continue it, that we may dream a statue Is with us and no fear of its decay! Diane. I am listening still to music . . . Enter King FranÃ§ois FranÃ§ois. Hin! But let me be a leper, if this is not My sonâla, la!â Droning an elegy to the fair widow! Satyr, your dull, black eyes Burn on her as the torches of her dule. Fie! Fie! It was deplorable to find her Weeping her noble BrÃ©zÃ©. Not a blink Of sunshine till I came to visit her. I was the Sun That snuffed those candles out! (To Diane.) Have you forgotten? [Diane looks at him reproachfully. Sa, sa, sa, sa! Yet it was matter of delirious mirth To see those candles ranged about the Moonâ And the untending thirsty cloudsâa! ho! Diane impatient for the chase! . . . She listened In the dark chamber to the crannied mouse, Or any the least knocking at the wall . . . Diane, with Master Marot's psalms Clung to her hand, and from her parted lips Hummings and cries as inarticulate As of dumb creatures when they are not dumb. I nearly gave my ghost up to my God With laughing at that chasing whiteness, set In modo e figura Dian, widow! Ha, ha! Not DianâDido in her bed, Weeping Sichaeus sore. (To Henri.) Staff of the Cross, So do we use our hours? Are we Ãneas? [Henri remains petrified. Sirrah, the heralds are in sharp dispute Upon some points . . . your homage and attend! [Henri bows and goes out. Bat of Valladolid, I loathe the boy! What dungeon sighs, what stares! He pules at me As if he grudged me still That he was hostage for the crown of France, To monachal, sour Spainâa bat, a cloistered owl! [Sitting down by her cosily. I grudge his ransom. Is there FranÃ§ois in him? What is he, for an heir? Diane. Alack, he has been long in prison, Sire. FranÃ§ois. Oh, my dear lady, when I was a boy I was full king, not only to my mother, Not to my perfect Marguerite, to all My retinue of youngstersâMarin de Montchenu, Montmorency and Guillaume de la Mark, And Philippe Chabot: but this gloomy Dauphin Has of his age no friends; haunting the Court Suspiciously as he were still a hostage, He brushes among women with the deafness And grunting of a boar. [Looking in Diane's face. But you are patient, Marvellous patient, cloudy Luna. Diane. Sire, What is the suit? FranÃ§ois. This little finger-tip! God and St. Benedict, here have we state-craftâ A crescent-point like those that blandish sea-waves To run ashore! Wind him about your finger, Counsel him, rouse him from his dreams! I fear My tardy Dauphin never will be man, Therefore appeal to catch you, SÃ©nÃ©chale, To such a business you shall lead alone With none for coadjutor. Willy-nilly Our Dauphin binds us fast to Rome and binds us To Italy, our sovereign Italy, As husband to Pope Clement's nieceâthis girl Of listening eye, a chit of wisdom, gay As innocence . . . ha, moss above, below Some rotten kind of stuff, a MÃ©dicis. The child amuses! He has wedded her At our command, but, sullen as a mule, The boy turns from his bride, embarrassing Our friendship with Pope Clement, by the fashion Of his dull conduct and discourtesy. Temper him, noble Matron, change his nature According to the prevalence he follows; Turn him to duty and to virtual aim In marriage, no more feelingly resisted Than glowed brass by the vision that a sun Endazzles from the heaven. [Diane is silent. It made me merry To find him playing at the Turtle-dove, Metamorphosed by Venus. SÃ©nÃ©chale, Complete, magnetic, sting his blockishness To flower of youth. Give him some countenanceâ Black-spotted weasel, handsome, If once his face were turned to human cheer. A dreary, sullen, sleepy child! I hate him [Diane is still silent. Did not your good devotion win from me Your father's forfeit life? Win from my son What traces of his father lie in cloud Beneath a surly Spaniard. By God's Body, I beg a royal thing of you, ma Belle, To mould us France. You smile? Hoc fac et vinces! So! And the task, the generous victory Shall wean you from your sorrow. You and I Cannot breathe captive. Let us then forget! Why run to Death, since memory is a cell Of the tomb-owning Monster? Nay, I'd rather . . . But cast those murky sables and be gallant In velvet of my favoured gooseberry-green, This skin would prick to goldness, challenging. Listen, fair Victrix, Help-in-Season! Listen! Be Dian to Endymion, and Lucina To France, protectress of her future Kings. Diane. Madame la Duchesse D'Estampes were better to this purpose, younger, More apt. FranÃ§ois. My Duchess! Is it jealousy Of my young mistress that provides a rival? She is not half your age!âtut, tut!âa crude, Young fruit, and not the perfect, lapping flower Of your maturity. To have you jealousâ My triumph! But, alas, for Winter, Spring; And for rude Ver the mellow Summer-eve With its moon-rising, and moon-setting dawn. My Duchessâla! He did not see her when we rode together To bring the captive home; she laughed at him Dangling your skirts. Ho, ho! My little son! My childilollie! Make a man of him! Madame de BrÃ©zÃ©, give him of your counsel! This little MÃ©dicis, beneath your guidance, Must bear him many children, you prevailing As goddess of his altars, where his heart And all his joys are rendered. Diane. Sire, Your suit is granted. FranÃ§ois (surprised and doffing low). Then I take my leave. [He goes to the arras, wonders and comes back. Diane stands defiantly before him. Diane. I have consented The Prince should wear my colours, white and black, My white and changeless sable. Presently He will become a man. FranÃ§ois. Let there be light, And there was light: so at a woman's fiat The face of the whole world is changed. Adieu! [Exit King FranÃ§ois. Diane. Not beautiful, a head Just turning grey, a face Wrinkled, swept over by a wind, discoloured! This to King FranÃ§oisâI am shamed before him; I would descend into my grave: but Henri . . . The great, brown eyes attest me beautiful, And I have solace of the lie. (Catching sight of herself in a mirror.) The truth Before meâI am beautiful with beauty Of very early springtide, little flushes Of light and promise, and a softer lip. Brusquet has entered. Looking up, Diane espies the Fool Brusquet, sweet fool, but I have played your part, Crying for joy. Brusquet. You are not then a fool. I never cry but when I have no joy. We have none, who must laugh the whole day long. Diane. But share it, fool, but share itâ Since it is wisdom to you, share my joy. Brusquet. Unfold it, Madam. Diane. Brusquet, I am beloved. . . . O witless fool, You do not ask by whom. Brusquet (simply). The Dauphin. Fie, fie, fie! I do not hazard impious conjectures, For the good Dauphin half an hour ago Threw his arm . . . thus! . . . Right round my neck and wept. I paint you, Madam, His very action, as it is my trade, And no offence. Diane. But what should follow, fool? The Dauphin weeps as you have seen me weep. Has he not bitter cause? As if still captive I pass him oftentimes Sitting in deep embrasures by himself. How should you think I am beloved of him? Brusquet (very softly). He gave no sign: it was the matching tears. I counted themâthey fell just of one number: Two on the cheek, one coursing down the nose Most fellowly . . . and they were drops of gold. I caught two on my hand . . . [Diane takes his hand and kisses it. He loves you, Madam. Diane. Swear on your bells, swear it by Cupid's blindness. Brusquet. No, noâthe matching tears Are my sole warranty. Diane. Brusquet, he carries My colours at the tourney, on his helm, His doublet and his cloakânot white and green, But white and blackâthe colours of my dule. Brusquet. He loves you, Madam . . . Diane (suddenly). Has the Dauphine risen? Is she within? Brusquet. Madam, there may be many Princesses, queens, and lawful spouses. Take This word of folly: have no eye for them, No ear, no angry tongue. He loves you, Madam. [Exit Brusquet, kissing his hand to her. Diane. How many years? There is so little time! [She takes a crystal hour-glass and watches the sand trickling through. Henri! O mes dÃ©lices! I think the purport Of age is to lay out before our eyes The entire and perfect spectacle of youth. . . . A year ago he poured into my lap Jonquils and violets: it troubled me; It seemed part of a pageant or a riddle It were my death to read . . . A Woman (at the door). Madame la Dauphine! Catherine de MÃ©dicis enters with her women. She is dressed in rose-coloured velvet. She makes a curtsey. Diane (rising). Nay! Can I ask forgiveness? You were the first to do me reverence. There has been error. Let me sit beside you. What! Are there tears and pallor on a face That is a stranger's! (To the Women.) Leave us. Catherine. Not my women! Diane. All of the retinue. [She waves them away; then puts her arm round Catherine. Unfold your grief. You are shy, sad; you are very shy. Cher enfant! But what is at the sources of your tears? Unfold your grief. Catherine (suspiciously). Madame la SÃ©nÃ©chale, You are the Dauphin's friend. Diane. I would befriend you. Yours is so high a destiny and pressed So suddenly upon you. Dry your eyes! This dusky-coloured hair, if broidered richer With certain jewels, may take satin sheen; But I must choose the jewels. You misdoubt That you can please him, Dauphine? Catherine. Why, he hates me More, as I love him more. Diane. His father loves you. Catherine. That is not enough. Diane. You love him? you would have him for your own? Catherine. I do desire it. Diane. Afterward as Queen? Catherine (vehemently). I do desire to be a Queen, his Queen! I do desire to have him for my own, All to myself. He is too fond of jousting, And he escapes me. Diane. Can you bear instruction? Catherine. Of any in authority. Your place? . . . Diane. The child! I am not this or that, the matron Chosen to give you guidance, nor appointed To rule your household. Let us speak as women! You love the Dauphin? Ay! With all the blinking of these diamond eyes; And you would be beloved. Is he not handsome? [Catherine sighs and draws from her breast a miniature. Diane. That is an exerciseâyou cannot judgeâ That is a thing painted for Italy, A bauble of no worth. Put it away. It would displease him. Catherine. You are bold to drop it So sudden from your handsâit is the portrait Of your young Prince . . . But you may braid my hair. Diane (dropping the braids). The Dauphine and his wifeâwill that suffice? Would you thus savour majesty? There is A Queen now of the Court, and so neglected, And of so poor account she did not even Advance to welcome you. I welcomed you; I had been so entreated. Catherine. Henri bade you? Diane. The Dauphin wooed me, And on his knees, to save him from that meeting, For he is shy and young. Would you look on him Such as he isâthe traits of this medallion [Drawing one from her breast. Are art that has sucked nature as a flower Sucks dew and then appears more perfect flower. Catherine (pettishly). No likeness! Diane. None of anything that you, Poor child, have ever caught or will encounter. Does it not even fascinate you? [Catherine silently gazes at the portrait, then her eyes fill with tears. Stay! If you would learn the secret which it holdsâ It is a captive's face and more, an exile's. I wonder, have you spirit fine enough To dote in pity on the weariness Of these dull eyes that, like an animal's, Have but the beauty of their loving? Catherine (her hand on the medallion). Give it! Diane. No!âbut you have it. Is he not your bridegroom? [Half to herself. The shell, the husk, the shadow and the name, Even these are dear possessions. Catherine. He abhors me; I am distasteful to him. [Grasping Diane's hand. SÃ©enÃ©chale, Something you said of satin in my hair, If you would twist it right? [Diane looses a chain of beryl from her neck and twists it into Catherine's fine dark hair. Catherine catches sight of herself in a mirror. She lifts up her arms to Diane and lays them round her neck. All the new dances Of Florence, the new gamesâI am very quick At gamesâand I will show you every point: You are not quick at games? Diane (smiling). But if la Dauphine, Will suffer me to guide her . . . Listen, petite, That is Prince Henri's voice, and calling me. Child, you have much to learn! So!âI have braided This satin hair to catch his eye, and, if You will defer to me, you will find favour. Now, do not sulk and do not speak a word. Re-enter Henri, calling Henri. Diane, my lady, O Dianeâ Diane. You shame me Ringing my name as we were in the woods. You fright our little Princess. To beguile This hour so tedious to her, I have sung Your praises; we have glanced at portraits tooâ And I have lost all knowledge of the hour, Wreathing her hair. Catherine (timidly). Madam is very deft, So deft: it is all Madam's art. [She bows her head for inspection. The eyes of Henri and Diane meet over the small, wreathed head. Henri (mastering himself). Good, good! I will conduct you straightway to the King: He loves these points and sparkles. Catherine. And these beryls Are Madam's; she unclasped the necklace. Henri. Good! They are become crown-jewels by her gift: You shall have all the homage. Do not render These beryls back to her again. I like That you should wear them in your glossy hair So, as the Duchess willed. [Henri takes Catherine's hand and leads her quickly away, leaving Diane alone. Diane. Is it in pique? The beryls were not of his gift. He touches Her cheek; she glows so in his pride of her: Like a small lizard she is beautiful. King FranÃ§ois tells me I must do this thing, Foster this marriage. . . . The crown-jewels hers And of his gift; ay, and the crown as well, If she bear children. . . . He is passed away Lifelong from me! My gift . . . What can my gift be to him but the years? I must go back, must seek The violets, in my nature, of my youth; They are bleeding for him, all my sweetness bleeds. I will not mind the King. I will transgress All honour, I will wash My eyes with tears. . . . The fountain of my tears, I fear, will break my heart! But I will suffer; I will do anything to be beloved For ever of him. Henri! Long ago I loved him on my knee, a black-haired babe; I loved him as a child just broke from prison, I have loved him in my dule, incredulous That he could love me. . . . It may be in sport, In dream; it may be he will cast me off. If he should cast me off! . . . [She bows herself, weeping bitterly. Henri stands before her, a curious smile on his face. Henri. I have left her with the King. Why are you weeping? Diane, this heavenly rainâ This softnessâ [He kneels. April! I broke the cloud? Are the rich clouds for me? Too marvellous It were if you could love me in this sortâ Nothing to come between. Could I believe . . . If I should dare! Are the rich clouds for me? [Diane kisses his raised hands and swiftly leaves him. Could I believe the miracleâbelieve I broke the cloud! Scene II Paris. The Dauphin's bedchamber at Saint-Germain. Courtiers move about with jewels and ornaments. Henri finishes his dressing to strains of exquisite music. For an instant he prostrates himself before a Crucifix: then he rises, and, with a movement of his hand, dismissing his courtiers, he approaches his Musicians, among them Jannequin, and embraces them one by one. Henri. Beloved, beloved. . . . Community of loved ones! My notes of music! Gratitude Is mineâhow shall I say it with my lips?â As for the dew that lustres my young roses, As for the dayspring that provides the day Its streams of freshness. Music! [As he breaks from them. Pass And let me hear your voices; as a flock Drops in a vale, and with a wider movement Ascends to clothe the hill. . . . I cannot part from you without a hope! [He touches a viol. Enter my prayersâthese flying prayers That are my thoughts in solitude. Ascend! [The Musicians retire and are seen above in a distant gallery. Jannequin returns. Henri has seated himself at a table and plays with a pen. Jannequin. Monsieur le Dauphin, What music for the coucher? âChant de l'Alouetteâ Is for the lever? But your favoured trifle âCaquet des Femmesââshall we repeat the air? . . . O women, women, and their music-babble Is for all hours, the morning, noon or night? What music for the coucher? [Henri sits blank. Monsieur le Dauphin, Unless . . . It must depend . . . There is a music glows like Hesperus. If my lord Dauphin please To comfort the lone Dauphine, newly wedded, Since he allows me access to his heart, And sorrow for the colours of its grief . . . There is a music bridal, prevalent, Epithalamium. Vivace! Prince, 'Twould give you recompense: the sorriest feast Vouched from the gallery with sound of rebecks Is eaten as untasted; appetite Itself being dulcet-quickened by the ear. Would you give order to your chamberlain . . . Henri. O Jannequin, are you King FranÃ§ois' spy? But if you areâlet him divert the child, That he is making Queen before my face, Before my mother's face. There is no Queen But my dead motherâthere I am bereaved. [Jannequin comes close and caresses him. I cannot! Jannequin. Listen! I have been persuaded And of the King, and of the MÃ©dicis, And of the noble SÃ©nÃ©chale herself. Henri (springing up). Enfer! La SÃ©nÃ©chale! Jannequin. If you could so estrange your life, your senses . . . Henri. O Jannequin, but you are not your music. Leave me alone! [Exit Jannequin. What of these days before me now? . . . My God, What of my youth? Why should I rise To the hours that are my doom? I know the weight Of the heavy-weighted hours and the long softness Of the tears that wet their sands. [He listens. Ha, music, music! It is not then all lost. This music comes Back on myself even as the wind blows back Her roses on the rose! [A song of his own is heard sung from the distant gallery. Endymionâ When the moon is gone And the shepherd lone with his flocks, In the dells and rocksâ What should the shepherd sing To the flocks at watering? Good care he gives to his sheepâ As a shepherd his flocks should keep: He lays him down in the noon, And dreams of the cool, full moon. Awake, he is like a king, As they crowd to the watering: So good is a dream to me As a contest of viols. Amen! [He listens rapt, nursing his knee. Henri. One must forgive her silence to the moonâ How should she so behold herself, except Below in the white fields, And on the glimmering haystacks and the ponds? What sorrow, burning sorrow, I am poet Never to her: to none But to the Lady Music. She, I think, Has been shut up in prison many years, Has waked in prison and her chains struck off. Diane! But did she crave her shepherd's pipe? Never!âEndymion's pipe . . . I must put back my giftsâthe resonance Is not for her! Diane, and she would have me vulgarâshe Would so profane! Fah, let my father urge Heirs for the kingdom, lineage, royal stockâ The future, I must honour as a slave! Diane, Diane! . . . I must put back within myself the coffret Of the jewels that I wrought for her: I swear It is more precious to me than her love. This loneliness I build up in my spirit from her ken Is a fierce refuge. Is it thus with lovers? Must it be ever thus? Enter the Lord Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. He salutes the Dauphin, then advances affairÃ© Cardinal. You are brooding, Dauphin? Henri. Ay, Lord Charles, a riddle And an enigma to you all? What claim Shortens the narrow limits of the hour I claim for meditation? Cardinal. Nay, my Prince, I would not so abridge your prayers. 'Tis Cupid That as an apparition puts to flight Our holy thoughts and weans us from our prayers. Henri (angrily). I shall not hunt to-day. Cardinal (shrugging his shoulders as he seats himself). To-dayâBlood of the Cross!âto-day the king Hunts with your wife. And it is not from him, Nor from the slender, coy audacity Of an Italian mistress I take orders: But from the Lady SÃ©nÃ©chale I come, And to convey her pleasure. She has noted A trouble, a distaste about your moods. âThe Dauphinââso I quote . . . how heavenly-fine Her observation!ââhas an eye unquiet, Fevered, distrustful of the flagrant lights The MÃ©dicis requires. He suffers.â Then, Dauphin, with angel's tenderness we Churchmen Can but adore and envyâthen she bade me, As armed with the strong impress of a dream, Creep to your privacy . . . for she has business In the little desert garden of the roses Beyond the cypress grove. She will not hunt. She has refused the call, nor will you find her Among her nymphs. She bade you bring your lute, And strike among the boscage such a strain As lures the goddess to her mortal. Dauphin, Fresh from the bath she met me, and inspired As from the sacred well-spring of the Muses. A lute was in her hand. [Crossing his legs. My Office said, I must repair to that most sacred garden, To smell the roses, and to catch the descant Of the nightingales enchanted to the Moon. [Henri is gone quietly to fetch out his lute; he puts on his plumed cap and turns toward a private egress. La, what a bird for the gin! Her adroitness had failed; she had offended, giving her company to Madame la Dauphine, and could only discover the matter of her offence, in nowise its cure. She appealed to me. I found he was living en garÃ§on and in frequent conference with musicians. I found Jannequin setting verses to music. La! what a bird for the gin! But this Dianeâsolid, invincible, she is as a statue in our Paris, as a beautiful statue. She is France. [He picks up a half-written page lying on the table, and goes out reading and chuckling. Scene III Paris. The Gardens at Saint-Germain. A little semi-circular ruin with open columns round, steps leading up to it. On these steps King FranÃ§ois is seated with his Petite Bande. All the ladies are dressed in gooseberry-green or mulberry-coloured velvet with silver sleeves. The King's arm is round Catherine de MÃ©dicis. King FranÃ§ois. Mignonne, Are we not hidden safely? Will D'Estampes Suspect us in a ruin? Fah, she preaches Religion to meâthe unholy credence Of hereticsâand all the while her face Goes preaching from its wrinkles I am old. But you, my plums, soft in your youth and merry In the immortal creed of being young, You, my green fruitage of the gardens, you That lift my hours up from their sorry weight, I am your sylvan Pan. My Nymphsâyour Pan! Catherine. O Sire, You with your converse of the heavens, discoursing To us your policies of light and time, Ripen our days. [The King kisses her on her mouth and cuddles her. King FranÃ§ois. Fine Mignonne, My little Politicianâah, we settle What heretics shall suffer in the squares; Or shall the Turk be knit to usâthe Turk! But, hush, my little mouse of Florence, hush! To-day, no politics . . . Here I am come to brood my sadness out; Here I am brooding as an ancient Pan, The Captain of the Oreads, Nymphs, and Dryads, Who, his long beard stroked toward his nose, conceives The world and all the caverns underneath, The graves, the hollow centuries before, Th' affrighting hollow centuries behind. When one is aging, every dusty proverb And fable shoots up wisdom; but, mes enfants, We must not think; we must refuse all mirrors, Even the faces of our friends in time. Mirrors be broken, friends of the old years Removed from vision! Only let me see Youth, youth, the red and green, the infantine! [Yawning. Come, I am heavyârise! Dance me a stately dance; and you must lead them, My little MÃ©dicis . . . you know the stepâ My favouriteâDes LavandiÃ¨res. Beat hands. Lo, Brusquet! Enter the Fool Strike your jester's lute, my Fool! Here are life's maskers. [They dance the Branle des LavandiÃ¨res: then a Pavane. Life! The fulnessâmotion, the round amplitude! The coil and rustling splendour of the colours! O Titian, were you hereâbrush to my wisdom, Arresting what I live by! Play more slowly, Fool, for your dancers, slow! That I may linger with these forms of youth. May God preserve me a few years to linger Where beauty is, where cloudless faces mingle. Ha, ha, my little MÃ©dicis, your stepping Is as the prance of Flora's self Across the bosomy hills in April-time. You pant! Break off! God's sake, if you should dance away a prince! I was indeed to blame! [Catherine returns to his side out of breath; he caresses her and makes her comfortable. Brusquet. Uncle of France, Here comes duet for chorus! [A sound of laughter and the touching of two lutes is heard. Wish, hish, hish! [The Dauphin Henri and Diane pass in front of the group, in their black and white dresses, absorbed and unheeding. The King whistles, and they pause. King FranÃ§ois. Black on the picture! Black!â You sting me! Nay, my lady SÃ©nÃ©chale, We have one secret, you and I, We have one wisdom. . . . He is young, though black. [With a malicious laugh. I take my medicine for years in syrups Of cinnamon and mentha, red and green . . . You, my superb, in black mandragoraâ Our tastesâbut the same wisdom. You and I . . . [The Petite Bande laughs on many soft notes. Diane. Sire? King FranÃ§ois. Go your way! The Dauphin blushes red Out of all limit of your black and white, Betraying your staid colours. Lady SÃ©nÃ©chale, Drop that suspended finger on the lute; The air yearns for it; draw your young musician Along with you, closing suspension, lady. Diane (smiling). Ever to be obeyed! [She touches the note, and Henri, making obeisance to the King, without looking, moves away with her. King FranÃ§ois. Ho, ho! My little MÃ©dicis, a cloudâno clouding! I am full sun upon your fortune, child . . . He but the Dauphin, and you Queen of France O my Italian daughter, The devil take me to my grave, if once I make declension from the life, the arts And the new learning of your Italy! O my Italian, But I am sad again! These Spanish fashions, Their sables and cold silverâfaugh, these zealots, These lovers shod with love, not winged with lightness Of variable Eros, trailing moonlight And darkness on the present! . . . Little winds, Strange little winds are loosedâI know not whither They go, nor why they are . . . a sad, old Pan Withering among his nymphs. [Rising. Break up the band! My daughter Catherine, we will hunt together, And you shall hunt astride across such country As woman's sideway-sitting could not vanquish. [He lays his hands on her shoulder and walks feebly on.] Like a pale boy, you with the pale, sick King, King FranÃ§ois, dying, dyingâ Shall hunt, the very Queen of Venery. No matter for those Lutinistsâthose zealots. . . . God's Mass, I hate a Spaniard as the devilâ As black Mephisto. . . . All stir up the hunt! Scene IV Anet: beside a fountain, deep in the heron-wood Enter together the Lord Cardinal Charles de Lorraine and the ConnÃ©table Anne de Montmorency. Montmorency. Bells! Cardinal. . . . Ah! the bells Of the homing cattle through the forestâlisten! Still deep in leaves the chime, as though fay-music Rang us out of the coverts from their midst To guide us home. 'Tis late. That levelnessâ There!âof a white ray is the great owl's wing. What, bide his gipsy-music when the cattle Have rung us home! Montmorency. But, Cardinal, When this fay-music shook along the brakes The Prince was no more of our company. Where is the Prince? Cardinal. Shall we not ask where lamps Our Lady Glow-worm of this forest-side, And then the Prince were found? Montmorency, Do all the lost pant for their finding? Seek him! Nay, rather yield him to the dusk Sylvani, And to the shadows where he watches shining His spell of snow-keen bait. Are not these flambeauxâ That make the banks an air of nether lights, The moss and grass, impenetrable cloud, Lit to induce the mate into Love's circle, From his dark vigil 'mid the glooms of earth? Call our saints down upon the Dauphin. . . . Pass! Ha, ha, these glow-worms and these holy places! The saints upon the Dauphin! Let us on! Montmorency. Is the moon rising? Cardinal. When the clouds Are velvet and one seems to smell their softness As fragrance, they are hiding-places chosen By the ascending moon . . . Montmorency. Quoit-players! Listen! How the quoits ring like glass! The players' voices, How they are raised up underneath the moon, Though far away! To Anet! Leave our Prince. [They go out. A great stag for a while on the grass that is kindled with glow-worms. Then he leaps back into the shadow. After a while Henri breaks through the forest-trees and throws himself down on the lawn by the fountain. Henri. Lost, lost! . . . The din Of the lutes we played together, 'mid the roses! And then King FranÃ§ois! . . . How I hate my father; And grow outrageous in his presence, all My powers put off as in a foreign land, Before strange potentates! He can discern No King in me, so crowns the Dauphiness. No Prince, no King! And the great SÃ©nÃ©chale, who is as deaf And foolish to my music as the fool, Must bribe my Jannequin and hire us lutes To thrum in company. . . . So lost, So hideously lost . . . I flee A madman from a mirrorânot my face . . . O Luna! Struck! Lost! [He bows over the rim of the fountain. Diane enters in her hunting-dress of white, with silver quiver. Diane. But my musician . . . Henri. Goddess! Diane. But my poet! . . . [She comes to him and bends above him, speaking softly. Endymion . . . Shut your eyes, Be veritably lost from Time, and Dian Will from infinitude and loneliness Herself steal down to a forgotten prince, Forgotten among sleepers of the night. Henri (springing up defiantly). A blinded shepherd! . . . But you cannot know . . . Not thatâActÃ¦on, by no hounds devoured, But by the gnawing fury of his senses At heaven dropt down on him. Who built the temples, The temples to the moon? Diane, I cannot speak to you. . . . My music Speaks back but to myself; the foolish verses I stammer through my tears, but chill my tears. You are mocking me. . . . My father mocks at me. What is your cruel pleasure? I escapeâ I have escaped from Parisâfrom my father, My bride . . . I have escaped . . . as fierce at heart As any brigand of the woods, as blemished, As desolate. In my captivity, Diane, I thought of freedom as a roving, Aimless and sorrowful . . . you succoured me, You were my goal as is the living sun The goal of every listless, growing thing: Then you became a blight to me, a bane, And the amazement of a curse that dooms me Homeless and unassigned to pallid Hell. My poetry, my music! . . . yes, we chimed The lutes together for a little while In the Rose-garden; yes, we breathed the roses In the desert-garden of Saint-Germainâyes, And read together Amadis of Gaul . . . To me as my whole history and life, To me who came, a child, from out a prison, As Amadis a child from forth the sea. They led me to you, and, as Amadis Lost never from his memory the word Of Oriana, how it pleased her well That he should serve her, from my memory Never will fail Your kiss upon my foreheadâas an angel Sinks from closed pinions. . . . Listen! . . . Oriana, 'Twas on soft herbage, 'neath the forest's cope, Amadis had his joy for all his love, And worst despair, by which a man may perishâ Joy for all this, joy on the greenwood grass . . . No playing lovers in a gilded Court! . . . Yes, we have chimed The lutes together for a little while In the Rose-garden; yes, we breathed the roses, And I am left more infinitely void, More slowly dropping blood than when you held me First at Bayonne and kissed me, but then dropped. Diane (gathering Grass of Parnassus, and playing with the fountain). O water, Blood-tinctured of my goddess, but he hurts us With his fierce onslaught. . . . If I dropped the child, It was . . . oh, sudden . . . as one puts away A man from one's embrace. [Henri looks at her silently. Goddess, he chides me! Dian, I stoopt too low. Henri. More to your fountain: let me hear your prayer. Diane (to the moon). That I may dye him even as my flesh Is of these placid depths made goldâmy prayer! [She rises from the fountain. Nor will you ever speak to me of music, Nor will you ever vex me with reproach; Nor serve me, dreaming as an idle shepherdâ [She lays her hand on his shoulder. But in great feats of arms my chevalier. Lo, all my forests with their scents and coverts I hold in leash till you become a man. Hippolytus, my hunter, votive to me Your life in every breath. Such speckled hounds As I will rear you, dogs of so fierce strain No hand may touch them, but your handâsuch steeds For you to dompt! And we will hunt together. Henri, the incommunicable joy Of waking to the hunt; the sounds Of the young morning . . . Henri, and by moonlight Together we will hunt the wolves. A Queenâ I would be Queen of Earth, not in the Court, Here in the purlieus of my mountain forest, Where the oak burthens, where the little aspens Tingle above the pool: I would be Queen Where the high echoes catch and every stillness Has its own star and echo in the leaves. [One of her little flowers is dropped. Henri picks it up. Beloved! You hold my little flower wrapt in your handâ I love it for its vernal breath, I love All flowers that nod and startle through the grass, All flowers of my stag's mottle . . . [He springs to embrace her. No, not yet! Henri, beloved, look up! Those clouds are horsemen . . . swift, ah, swift, as those Must be your course: and they attain the moon. Henri (kneeling). Forget How young and sleeping in my qualities I lie before you. Stoop to me, receive me! [She kisses him. The sweetness of a universe let down On one poor, young, closed heart! [There is rustle among the bushes. A Voice. Where is His Highness? Diane. A messenger! We will receive him, Princeâ Trembling nor fugitive. Voice. Where is His Highness? [Diane is about to reply; Henri puts his hand across her lips. Henri. Here at the King's command. Saddle my horse. [The bushes are still. Henri and Diane kiss. Diane. Leave me thy heart! [They walk a little way in silence. . . . But you forgetâ Henri (laughing low). The King's command? I am myself a King. [He turns away and leaves her. His voice a little way off. O Ronsard, true! not AnetâDianet. Diane. There is no death in love, except this death, And stopping of Love's breath by lovers' handsâ This parting. . . . How I love him, So wild and royal; it is like a curse To bear his shining eyes. . . . He must not suffer, And shed on me the glory of his youth, If afterward. . . . O crystal Moon, that showest All ages in thy turning magic stone, Let me not on thy ominous glass behold him Waking to disillusion. All my moments Are to his pleasure, and I build this Anet His home, I draw the hunt around its walls, And round its fires carve crescent moons and quivers, Set in my trees the trailing herons, cage The leopard in my halls; on terraces Broider my peaches blowing posied flowers, Or on my tables stand Cellini's bowls And Palissy's illumined vasesâall To bind his senses to his passionate heart, Submissive to one joy. . . . A distant shouting! A roundelay of shouts! . . . It was so silent I heard the woodmouse creep. Again! More clear The roundelays of shouts! [She listens. Voices. Vive, vive le Roi! Diane. The little, creeping feet . . . then Vive le Roi! And horses' hoofs scattering their noise abroad. King FranÃ§ois dead? Le Roi est mort! And Henri Careering to a throne? [She sits down. Years fall on me . . . [She passes her hand over her forehead as if stunned. Another woman now Is Henri's Queen, to-night is Queen of France; And other women of resplendent youth Proclaim in their fresh bosoms their young King. Another is his Queen and will be crowned His Queen! The little MÃ©dicis, his Queen! O Child of Jove, my Sponsor, shall she rule? O Sister of the gods, shall this thing be? Anet, O Anet, Thy costly buildings vain, as vain as dross The courtways, balustrades and gleaming treasure Of Limosin, Cellini, Palissy, Vainâif a Queen and of immortal stamp Rule not among them. In this magic castle, Among the woods, Diane must be established, And cried the Queen of any Queens alive, Till the years yield, and the laws yield, and even The ceremonies in old Saint-Denis Are empty rites beside her coronation. [Listening. Footsteps this wayâsteps of a messenger? No, my fantastic sculptor paces night Alone, or as if handfast with the moon. MaÃ®tre Jean! [Goujon pauses. Goujon. Your servant! Diane (advancing). MaÃ®tre Jean, are there not dreams that exile Time? Goujon. Dreams, Madam, exile Time from any future, And only guard him in his Golden Age When he was young; for dreams are memories Alive, as tyrannies of happy gods Over all change. Diane. MaÃ®tre Jean, you must forsake Your doors, your mantelsâart of masonry! And do a finer miracle: present me In sculpture as a Dream, A troubling Dream that shall for ever hold The moved heart of a Dream; such talisman As in a little lake kept Charlemagne gazing Whole-eyed before it while the day went on. MaÃ®tre Jean, my years are manyâmould a dream! This house is sadâ The many years rule over itâdepose them! Let the one vision, let the talisman Govern the coming in, the going out Of sovereign love. [He lifts his cap. Goujon. Madam, a sculpture, is it? The goddess set in trees? Diane. Dian, my angel, My sponsorâ Goujon. At the font? I have the dream, Not for dull trees to shadow, for the moon To heave a ghostlike pall on. . . . Would such vision Be talisman to rule a house of youth, To trouble Love's imagination, quickest Of faculties? No, no! I carve a fountain, And you shall listen to the untired waters, Smile from your couch at their untired abundance. . . . Think, how the streams abound here! Powerful youth Is in them as a legend. From their waves I will evoke the genius of the place, A woman, clear and fresh, a huntress-fairy Clasping a royal stag, pillowed on bulk Of a huge hound, and, in repose from hunting, Attentive to the brightness of the waters, To their eternal movement, to the glances Of sun on them and lovely moon by night. So you shall dream and be yourself the Dream. Diane. MaÃ®tre, I will be a fountain. Goujon. And a goddess! But, Madam, for the royal love a woman, Not the inexorable lunar beauty, A goddess and yourself: the shapely head Adorned with France's rarest gems, a bracelet To start the mind back to the gracious woman As only vesture of mortality. A gallant, troubling spell! Ah, Madam, noble, Amusing and eternal. Diane. At my font, Baptized with the cold streams that feed my bath, As an old witch in childhood counselled me; The captive stag, those jewels and my beauty Resolute in its youth. . . . Amusing, noble! MaÃ®tre Jean, against the stag I shall let dangle a few gathered blossomsâ You see how I am dreaming with your dreamâ Thus, from my hand . . . King FranÃ§ois died last night! The Dauphin Henri is your King. Goujon (kneeling). Our Queen. The Steward enters Steward. Madame la SÃ©nÃ©chale, His Majesty King Henriâfor such title To-night is hisâbade me of his royal love To tell you of his sovereignty, and pray you That you will start to-morrow for Saint-Germain. [The Steward bows and withdraws. Diane. MaÃ®tre Jean, our secret! Keep your knees one breathing Of these white forests. . . . We can hear the streams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I Twelve years later Paris. Les Tourelles. A gallery. FranÃ§ois Duc de Guise and the ConnÃ©table Anne de Montmorency. Guise. You have been vanquished and undone by her Who is the Catholic, all-swaying Power That France must move to. Montmorency. Ay. Guise. The Catholic, High Power that bound our throne in solemn pact With Spain, when I drove back beyond Saint-Quentin Its Paris-aiming chivalry in rout. It was Diane, remember, who at Cateau- CambrÃ©sis made a peace for all the world: It is Diane who, of herself, has taught Her King to reign, converting into prudence The slowness of his nature, and his gloom Converting into dignity, inspiring His faults to seek their virtues, and his silence To seek its speech, as the rock-muffled river Vaults from its source to all the praise of men. Montmorency. Ay so! Guise. She is the Catholic, Supreme Power that has sanctified a league Between our Christian King and Rome, between Our crown and the tiara. Could you dream That any fancy of a day or days Could scare from the King's vision that white Eagle Of his dominion? Fie! Your King and your young Beauty You bedded them. . . . Well, fie! Montmorency. Seeing this Dian ride her moon and gather The reins of all the elements and forces Men, counsellors, their sovereign's friends, should sway, Prevailing, I was jealous; and, when April Drew the King heavy-browed among the hawthorn And spangle of the time, proclivity Was urged with sight of a regaling Eve. Ah, well, he tasted Spring awhileâoh, heigh, It passes with the shedding of the Spring. My rival keeps her slave upon our throne: Well, well! I, at Ecouen, Before my door, have slaves worth any homageâ The envied twain Of Michel-Ange. I shall retire awhile To my Ecouen. Wholly it surpasses Her Anetâits erection and its treasureâ Through critic grip of my obtainment, richer Than she by avarice can impropriate. The King! Guise. His step and eyes toward you. Repent! [Exit Guise hurriedly. Enter King Henri Henri. Is she removed? . . . Assure me! Montmorency. Sire, The Lady Fleming is removed. Henri. ConnÃ©table, O my dear traitor-friend, I am absolved, Forgiven!âabove me all my cloud of sins Turned by the Moon and her smile's shepherding To snowy tendance round her amplitude, Garde royale of her bounty. O wide pleasure, For which to sin is almost recompense, As spots float into graces! I have pleaded, Montmorency, for you. She must forgive you . . . but she will not hear Even my confession: she will only speak, Dieu, of our love, herself grown beautiful As if to speak its glory. O divine! I pleaded for my friendâ She will not hear your name. Montmorency. Nor do I kneel For Madam's absolution. Gracious sire, I have not sought it. Henri. But my love for youâ Her great indulgence! Montmorency. You are trembling, Sire; I have no dread of Madam. Henri. Fool! Montmorency. But for your sake . . . Henri. One day, and soon, your hand Touched by her clement hand, shall make accord; I can be happy thenâat peace. Montmorency. Nay, Sire, The little Scottish woman was complaisant Of white and rose and kissing breath as any The floweriest orchard-tree on the sun's side. Henri. Peace, peace! My PrincessâI would think of her! Montmorency, you must be friends, as soon As she will hear your name. And listen, friend; You shall assist a festival of joy, I have dreamed forth already. When to-night The moon emerges, I and my little Dauphin, The king and heir of France, will ride together In robes of silk, mystic with every blue And sheen and orient of the lovely moon; Our followers armoured as in opal shells Plated for Neptune's wars: we shall ride round The Rue Saint-Antoine, where we hold the jousts, And dance like Centaurs, we on our white horses, To eastern music, such As yields the moon her moonlight backâsuch music As in its passion quits the nightingale To rise of its own voice where groves are exiled And day can boast a throat. O such a music As comes from old religion of old Mages, From incense of white, Indian incense-flowers. We shall ride out from Les Tourelles, and you, With half the riding-company I lead, From the HÃ´tel Montmorency. [Arresting Montmorency from speech. Consider! The moon! The eastern music! Think, as Centaurs To ride, yet move in harmony, yet dance For one so heavenly. The cavalcade, The curvets, circlings and the caprioles, The feat on feat of crowning horsemanship! And stars, we must have starsâ Hundreds of torches . . . for the stars are watchers How night performs her miracles. The Dauphine Marie Stuart enters What, Marie, Drooping along the gallery, no Dauphin Lurking about you with his secrets, child? Marie (running up to him). Where is my Gouvernante? No one has seen her! Where is my Lady Fleming? Montmorency (pinching her cheek). Fie, fie, bonnie Scotland! Fie, fie! Henri. Will you not be a Queen? Then, little Marie, You will see many come and go: consider Only how you remain. You shall continue Your studies with the princes, and henceforth Rest, where I love to see you, in the arms Of the great Lady SÃ©nÃ©chale. Consider How she effects the king in your young prince! She can effect in any prince a king; In any princess at her charge a queen. [He kisses her forehead. Come, Marie, for our Ronsard waits my comingâ âApollo of the Muses.â Gracious words Of your young adoration! (To Montmorency.) Friend, to-night Our moonstruck chivalryâto dance, to dance In clouded film of dazzlement and joy! âAux rais connus de la Lune Assemblez sous la nuit brune!â Come to our poet! Queenlet Marie, come! Scene II Paris. A bedroom at Saint-Germain Catherine de MÃ©dicis, recovering from childbed, is seated by a great hearth, sunk in a velvet chair. Near her is the cradle of her third son Henri. Two pale children, FranÃ§ois and Charles, come in and out from time to time. The old nurse, Angela de Florence, is on her knees at the side of the hearth opposite to Catherine's chair: she holds her eye against a hole in the floor. Catherine. The boys are in the passage with the dog; You hear him yap and yawn as Carlo scolds . . . To youâah, Angelaâto you my children Have been Italian. Is not this our moment? . . . Babe, you are sealed away and safe. . . . Bambino Angela, O my jewel, My eye of light, reflect, O magic crystal, Not what shall be, what is. Are they together? Angela. Madonna says the truth, they are together? Catherine. Can you see, Angelaâin flagrant deed? Angela. A fire . . . and the King kneels. I cannot reach Above her bosom, for her head is tilted Beyond my peep-hole; but the hearthside fire Is rose-red on his hand that covers hers. Catherine. Begging for deed, or is it gratitude? Ha, ha! A queen and goddess in the heavens, My Jove! And peacocks that have eyes, my Jove! And Juno born again, At Florence, of the patient MÃ©dicis. . . . Angela, I turn faint. My camphire-flask! No, no! Re-set your jewel, Nor loose it from its socket if I die. Are the boys running hither? Carlo buffets The dog or pulls his coat out, while Francesco Protests his brother cruel. . . . Hear his voice, As little as a viola de gamba's! What do you see? Angela. The hand rose-red on hers. Catherine. Have not the fingers tightened, Angela? Angela. No, Madonna! They are laid as before: they are not clasping: so I have seen my own father, sitting under the grapes of his door, when it was duskâ'las, in the old daysâhide my mother's hand with his. Lifting herself.) How my eye waters, and aches, Holy Virgin! This eye of mine should be twice as big as the other, and little wires twang in the ball. . . . Dear Saints! She is swooning. . . . Poor little head, poor little paleness, drooped, drooped! Frail mother of fragile children, her births almost most deaths. La, la, la! But with each she is stronger, birth by birth, child by childâher taint of death is drawn away by their new flesh âand each is pale as my apron and weak as an old chair in the damp. . . . La, la, la! Smell the camphireâEcco! We see light again! We revive! Catherine. A grey, old woman, Grey as a nun. . . . (Laughing.) In Greece there were Grey Women Who had one eye among them. . . . Miserable, You are not looking. Clap your eye toâlook! Angela. I only see the rose-red hand again. Catherine. And laid flat in the firelight? Basta! basta! Lift up your head!âThe children! Enter FranÃ§ois and Charles FranÃ§ois. Mother dear, Charles is so cruel; he has wrenched a tuft Of Lolo's hair. Catherine. The creature has not bitten? Carlo, your finger? Go to Angela. Angela. Nothing, carissimo, nothing. Come with me. . . . I will put on Madonna Valentina's Euphorbium ointment. Come, Carlo. . . . Frightened at a bite! You should not play with wicked dogs. Catherine. Give him some aqua vitÃ¦: he is shaken. The beast shall be destroyed. FranÃ§ois. But Carlo hurt her; The blood sprang in her coat. Catherine (to Angela). Send out a page to drown her. Charles. They love me, how they love me, all the dogs! And I love themâto put them in the river. Catherine. You with your cold! Go in to Angela. [Exit the Nurse with Charles. FranÃ§ois (kneeling and laying his head against her knee). Lolo is mineâ Let her be sent away where Charles can never Creep up to her and hug her and then hurt. He follows like a shadow, croons above her, Then all at once her yell screams out. O maman, Send her awayâbut do not kill my Lolo, Ma Petite! Maman, maman, Send her away . . . My Marie loves her dearly. Catherine. Marie Stuart Must weep your snapping cur. Now do not cry . . . You will awake your brother. Pish, pish, FranÃ§ois, Go in to Angela and stay within: But tell her I await her. Go! [Exit FranÃ§ois. (She looks at her hands.) . . . I fatten! I shall live on; I shall have age. And some day that proud woman, there below, His hand is on, will feel the hand of death Inevitable. La Vieilleâ That is her name, when courtiers meet and laugh. One day she will be taken by the yearsâ The twenty years between her and the Kingâ Forth to her sepulchre, and I alive, If Fate confirm my youth; for I am waxing In flesh; I shall live onâI shall have age. Re-enter Angela Quick, quick! your senses mine at loopholeâseeing And hearing, mine! Peep through, then lay your ear Flat on the floor. Angela. They have not stirred, Madonna. Catherine. Not! Dio mio, how they love! . . . Now listen! Angela (alternately peeping and listening). He murmurs how he has loved their childâhow he loves Madonna Diane de France. . . . YesâLa Valentina has moved her hand from under his. . . . And he says that while your children are princes her daughter is unacknowledged. . . . She has risen . . . and he says he will suffer it no more. . . . I see Madonna Valentina now: they have risen; she carries a high head. . . . He says he will acknowledge his daughter. Catherine. Henri, my little son, my cradle-babe! Henri! Angela. He says this act is the witness of his heart, that he has no fatherhood till a child of his love is a princess. . . . Madonna Valentina stands loftily, as if her feet were on stone, as a statue's. . . . He says there shall be no pause in the vehemence with which that blessed writing of his pride as a father shall be prepared, and with it titles, honour. . . . She stretches out her arms, as women do when soldiers break into the house. Catherine. But she is silent? Grovel, Angela! Your ear, your ear! Angela. His voiceâthe warm, beelike drone of his voice: joy, fatherhood, his living flower! Now, now it stopsâher voice!âLet me see! She has pushed him on the chest with her hands; he is out of my sight. . . . Let me hear! She says, âI have belonged to you because I love you.â Catherine. Ah! Angela. And she says no decree of his Parliament shall ever make her his concubine. . . . âI will not suffer it.â But is she gone? I hear his feet about the chamber. A sob? No! Is it a moan? No, noâsomething other, not of that kind; I have heard such cry out of doors. It is in the room with the fire where he was. And Madonna la Duchessa is gone away. Catherine. She acts, O cunning Wanton, as her Normans Bargain about their pippinsââLeave them, leave them! Who wants to sell?â The King? But is he sighing Or humming purblind as a heavy bee Black at the honey? Is he still below? Angela. There is a sigh . . . he is still pacing. He whistles. He cannot tell what he should think . . . he raps his knuckles on the table and his rings chime out. Madonna, he has unbolted the little door of your staircase. I believe he is coming up . . . [She rises from the ground. Catherine. My Jove ascending, tired of vagrancy, His mistress fled away? Is this kind father Coming to grudge the princedom of his heirs? The queenship of his wife? I cannot raise me . . . My place is by my Henri's cradle. Trim it! Nurse, wimple the white round my hair, and waken The baby that it cry up from the ground. Call Carlo and Francesco . . . set them by me, For in these pledges Of royalty the bankers of the Arno Do homage to the Queen they bred for France. Princes of France! . . . Call Charles And call the Dauphin FranÃ§ois. [Exit Angela. Ha, ha, ha! To peep from the same hole at the same treason Year after year, to play divinity Over the criminals of many a sin, To clasp their secrets and be tolerant As Time is, and as Fate, and as Great God Himself . . . Enter King Henri Sire, you confound me! In the twilight I never had a visit from your Highness. The hour is unprepared, or we had shown you Less of forlornness; we had lighted lights, And slipped the ermine round us. You surprise What we had gladly screened of our estate. Henri. You have been languidâ They told me. Catherine. Henri. . . . I am stronger now . . . Henri is feebleâah, so feeble still, He criesâyou hear himâlike an orphaned lamb. Henri. Monsieur le Docteurâ These chambers are his very pharmacyâ What does he promise? Catherine. Sire, he promises When the harsh winds decline . . . Can you not touch Your flesh and blood? Henri. Madam, where are your sons FranÃ§ois and Charles? Catherine. They are sent for, Majesty. Why did you visit me, so like a spectre At eve? And all my fire gone down to dust, Forgotten on the stones . . . Come, Angela, Bring in the Princes. [The Nurse enters with the boys. We have lost the fire, Talking together. Kindle it! My Dauphin, Salute your father; Charles, salute your father. [They kneel. The King gives them each a hand indifferently. Henri. A spectre do I come? Alas, you call me These little spectres inâ (Between his teeth.) A Vampire litter! This boyâhow hollow-chested? What is ailing? Catherine. Charles was dog-bitten. Nurse, you have applied Madame de Valentinois' Most rare Euphorbium ointment? Did you pour him The aqua vitÃ¦? He is mortal pale. Angela. Ay, till carissimo was choked, Madonna. Henri. Take him to bed! Always Italian here and always ailments! Charles, have you given Your verses in the flower-of-lily book To the MaÃ®tre Ronsard? Charles. No, Sire. Henri. I will give them. He has perused my verses, our great Master, Our Oriole of the fountain and fresh grove. Send me your tutor with the little book. Now hide your cold a-bed. Ah, Monsieur Dauphin, What is your ailment, that you bind your forehead, ChÃ©ri, with hand and fingers? Catherine. He has cruel, Most thrilling pain. Shut your left earâMon enfant, Is it your father?âNo, he does not answer; He cannot hear me. Put the hand away. Monsieur le Docteur says a cold has struck him Too inwardly. Henri (with eagerness). Come with me to la Duchesse, And let us ask her help. Madame la Duchesse, Knows of kind herbs, is wise in powders rare, Made from Licornus. O my little spectre, She can enweave into her remedy A dead man's hair! Come, she will ease this aching. And, Madame, you are languidâby-and-by She shall prescribe a quick restorative; Yea, and appoint you better tendance, Madam, Not ashes on the hearth, nor a poor cradle-child Puling for milk. Catherine. Your little Catherina. . . . A kiss. . . . You are so careful of my health. [She fawns on his velvet cloak. He lets a caress fall on her brow. Your little Catherina. . . . Non, ta Catherine. Henri. Your Dauphin shall be rendered back to you And swiftly by his tutor. FranÃ§ois, come! She has the mysteries of life? Your hand! [Exit with the boy. Catherine (closing her eyes). How beautiful! Gallant and stately, King and Paladin, Snow on his forehead! Even his youthful hair Worships her into greyness, and his eyes Have turned from dull and twilight into dark With vivid stars to wait on her. Re-enter Angela He climbed My tower to find excuse for new approach To her. . . . My child, my eldest-born, my son, My King-to-be shall link them in again After their quarrel. . . . I have cunning witâ Ah, and my Paladin, a soul so simple, He lays himself before my wit as naked As he was born. My child shall link them in! He calls our children phantoms. By-and-by His mistress will lift up to me her drugs, Her powder of the fat of unicorn; And I, a MÃ©dicis, a Florentine, Dare drink the potion. . . . She would have me live, And breed my phantom-children; as a friend She will arrange my house; but never part us, Angela, my own eye and my own ear, Neverâfor all her dominance! I tarry . . . I thriveâfor I am spreading round the chin A ripple of more chin, That spreads a circle of deep augury. You find me fatter, though by childbed wearied And faint, do you not, Nurse? I shall have age! And I have hatred, soft, Ah, it is soft as worms that hunger on In graves they will disburthen by-and-by: So soft, so blind, so constantâhate! Angela. Madonna, La Valentina and Carissimo. Enter Diane with FranÃ§ois Diane. The King reports you languid, MignonneâAh, What heat beneath these braids! Let me shed on your forehead a clear shower, As if an April showerâand from this cloud . . . But you would hold the phial? As you will! Now waft my Spanish fan . . . 'Tis breeze and shower Together that re-animate . . . Catherine. Where is the King? Diane. The King? He left me for the Racquet Court. Catherine. They tell me, Madam, there All note his errors, as he were not King, Speak his mistakes or put him in the wrong. Diane. Why not? He loves the game. Catherine (as if talking in her sleep). All note his errors, And watch, and sometimes put him in the wrong. Diane. I leave my Spanish fan. . . . Nurse, come within. This child is ill with fever. Catherine. Tell the King . . . Diane. I shall not see him, Mignonne. Any message Will find him in the Racquet Court. . . . Catherine. By magic Can you work spells, emptying your physic jars, To ease the Dauphin? Diane. Then you are eased, ma chÃ¨re? We must foment this ailing little head. Come, nurseâwhere is your readiness? Neglect All round the Queen! Take heed Or you will lose your honourable place. Catherine (starting up). Never! She is of many years beloved. We do not part. Diane. Softly! We would not fret you. And if she serves you well . . . Catherine. She serves me well. What were a leaping fire upon the hearth To a kind tongue that stories the blank hours? What were a lamp in twilight to an eye That sees with us our far-off land, that sees With us the basking lizards on the stones Of the Bargello or the Vatican? She serves me as I need . . . Take back your fan, Madam, it has made air enough. Diane. Mon FranÃ§ois. Fetch me my fan, and come, pauvre petit, come. [They go out with Angela. Catherine. Her cheeks are hot and lines upon her temples. She sprayed me fresh! . . . O rainbow of my scutcheon, Come to me from her shower! Henriâah, Henriâ To-night he will be lonesome on his bed, Because he is in quarrel with his Moon, His scorched Moon. . . . Ah, to-night He will lie scorched and desolate above His keys of office . . . but no starry usher Will give him entrance to his Dian's graceâ Locked! He will sleep in bane! He is defeated, And I avengedâno royal child I bore him Could link the paramours. He is defeated! I bless his scorched Moon. He will sleep in bane. Scene III The forest of Evereux, by Anet, at crosswaysâone road leading to a hermitage, where a red light burns, the other to deeper forest in snow. Diane, under a cloak and veil, turns back to a Messenger, who stands below her, panting. Diane. I cannot see the King, I may not see him; It is forbidden me, amid these snows, And sharpest cold. I cannot see the King. Messenger. Madam . . . Diane. I left command Before I started for the little chapel Beyond there in the snows. I must go forth Through the winter to my shrift. Dismiss the King. Messenger. And shall I say? . . . Diane. I keep my solitude. [Exit Messenger. She makes a few steps upward, then leans against a bare Spanish chestnut, breathing heavily. Anet! It is itself a sepulchre; Its chapel guards my husband's memory. Here I am honourable, here A dedicated widow . . . for De BrÃ©zÃ© Haunts not; his ghost is laid. Enter through snowy briars Diane de France. She bows, almost prostrating herself before La SÃ©nÃ©chale. You startled me! What are you, child, and whence? Diane de France. I am from the King. Diane. And with what suit? Diane de France. The King Stooped down and kissed my forehead; he complained To find me distant from you; for he said He had given me to you, and so fair a gift Must needs be cherished. Madam, he was gentle; And while he waited in my cabinet I strove to entertain him duteously. Gentle!âbut when you so repulsed him, Madam, He bade me to your presence as I was, Muttering in harshest tones he would not take Refusal of your lips save from my lips. Diane. Then from your lips refusal, and retire, Your errand done, to study of your books. Diane de France. Madam, it is a fÃªte. Diane. Entreat the King To go with you a-huntingâhis indulgence, Or my command. Do not return to me [Exit Diane de France. There are two children sleeping in my tomb: Would that my children were all sleeping there! This mortal issue is not of a strength To blazen me his goddess. Dian breeds No progeny. . . . Endymion alone, That boy, hid shining in a cave, attests Her reckoning with the mortal hours, her fondness, And all that she would leave of trace on earth. Henri! But he shall suffer the extreme Of love's humiliation till he raise me Supreme in honour to the world. His Queen, And at my pleasure and when I decree, A slave, has borne him children; at my pleasure. . . . Colder and colderâI will grow more cold! Henri! If I have fought for you with Time Till he has wondered at me and stood by; If I have made a spring for you where fiercely Winter was at his ravening undergroundâ Shall I not guard for you your Dream intact, Something most steadfast, lighting you before? Henri! But you must suffer thousand pains If I can keep this Vision, clear and deathless And never-wavering, in your faith. . . . Beloved, I am old and weary: one of us must die. [She stands for a while mute, her eyes on the snow. Rousing herself. But I must leave him for this winter journeyâ Leave him . . . and offer penance for my dear, Inevitable sinning, while he fondles That younger Diane . . . [Suddenly Henri springs up the forest, now dusk. He carries a torch that throws its red light on her face. (In a half-raised voice.) I take rest . . . Go back! Henri. Diane, this torture, all this rank dismissal, Your eyes grown spiked and ruddy as the stars: I cannot find my fault. You will not speak More than the fatal winds; you are as dumb As the jailer who conveyed me fort to fort: I did not heed if I were borne to death, Not then, nor now. . . . Diane, you will not speak? You cannot?âSomething I have done You will not look upon? The offence must be Airy and in conception . . . as to tread Rashly on hallowed pavements . . . for in knowledge I cannot sin. You treat me As I had offered to you in my speech Insult so gross you are cut off from speech. Or do you dare in jealousy to doubt I honour you completely, without rival? Diane, if I have lacked In honour to youâas through sleepless nights Sometimes I have accused myself, no more You shall accuse. My fault? As hawk in anchored flight I ride the air To fall on any guilt or speck of error Toward you, my one and only Princess. Diane. Sire, You have offended the Uranian Love We read of in our Plato, in the book Tri-spotted with our fleurs-de-lis, between The strait embrace of our name-letters. Henri, It was as when the East thrusts on the South Its closure of dark clouds, when on my ear, Open to heaven in your voice, there gathered Discourse of proclamation and of law; An edict of your parliament. Henri. I could not Think that your high aloofness drew from that. I would have honoured you in the clear day: The Dian born of us is given to night. Diane. There she belongsâour secret, beautiful By nature and by nurture: there she ends, In quiet of the majesty of night. I who was made to give you heirs, of you To rear up children of a royal race, Because I love you, Henri, am your Mistress; And this dear name you have brought very low, Proclaiming it, rejecting it. I am Your Mistress; but no favours of my love, Till you have so exalted this dear name, It is breathed low throughout all Christendom. Shall law and equity, at your appeal, Blazen me forth yonr concubine? It haunts! So Lucifer made hell for Godâa creature Of his immortal essence fallen, grown false. Henri. Diane, you rouse me! Such contamination Was never of my thoughts. I would atone . . . Diane. Peace, peaceâatone! Love's Worshipper atone! Oh, we are fallen indeed, a man and woman Beneath the Curse,âno more beneath our Dream. You make us sinners, Henri. . . . Then, atone! Before the altar of our God, before Yon little altar-shrine, apostate-love, Vow me in expiation many a pile Blazing round those who disallow their God. So in the fuel heaped for burning, so By holocaust, by sacrifice, offences Your weakness lays on us as cardinal, Shall sink to venial through the cleansing fire. Light me the flames! The Universe shall see your expiation, The heretics shall tremble and the Church Be re-exalted in this Huguenot And doubting France . . . Light me the flames, light up the Universe! So Love, the terrible, Uranian Love Shall glow forgiveness on you. My dimned lover, Promise me holy pyres to cleanse this sin, This heresy, this brutish ignorance!â That I to you could be your concubine, And not the Mistress of Love's Temple Court, Once and for ever past all circumstance. Your oath! Henri. My oath! I will condemn the heretics to anguish That burns as mine. Diane, but I was dull In my impiety! What desecration! You lead me to the bridge-way from whose key The gulf of Hades can be measured outâ I will light fires! But how atone to you? I know not how! This fiery cleansing of my realm for God Of treason and apostasy . . . I know not! . . . The fires will blaze His glory, as the morning Or evening blaze the glory of the Sun: But you? If I were hoist on some Himalayan spire To offer incense fo the utmost starsâ Vain would it be, vain as to touch with homage, That breathes up through the firmament, your glory, Assured against Death, against Time assured. You ask an oath: with loyalty more firm Than ever hath been sworn to a new Prince I yield you my obedience; and my torch Pledges its element to your command. But something I must do of my own self To reassure you to the Universe Goddess, the Queen and Mistress of my soul, The worship of my royalties. Not yet, Not yet can I conceive! Diane. Thy faith, mon ami. I cried for that. Henri. Not yet, Not yet can I conceive . . . Diane (in a whisper). Till Christendom Breathe low before my glory. [They begin to move up to the hermitage. Henri. Hark, Diane, How the dogs howl! They say the dead are passing When dogs howl on so hollowly . . . and redder Than blood the torch! . . . Diane, my only Mistress, My faith, my faithâtill Christendom breathe low. Come to the shrine. O night of deeper forest Than daylight tells of, hear the incantation Of one who as a poet would conceive! . . . How strained a note The dogs are wailing on! Come, vows and deeds! My torchâa snaky litter! Queen of Spirits, Divine as Luna or as Hecate, This breath of forests! So the world shall breathe, And Christendom breathe low, and time to come. [They are lost behind the bare Spanish chestnuts. Scene IV Paris. Les Tourelles. Madame Diane's apartment, steps at the back leading down into her private chapel. To the right a bed of white satin; to the left a window filled with red light that dyes the bed. Her Women, the Demoiselles Cassandre, AstrÃ©e, HÃ©lÃ¨ne and HÃ©loÃ¯se, are laying silken sheets on the bed and laying out a dressing-robe of cloth of silver. Cassandre. Her hunting done, tissue of cloud awaits her, The sylvan turned celestial . . . but to-day, See, the moon-chamber blushing fierilyâ See, the struck glow! AstrÃ©e. 'Las, I have some compassion; You none, Cassandre. Is not a man, poor devil, Ruled on those flames straight as a line? They tell me The heretics go naked to their ash, However clothed for tying to the stake. Think of the poor Couturierâand no clothes! A foolish, mincing, modest fellow once! HÃ©lÃ¨ne. A Huguenotâa fellow So modest he could scarcely find the face To speak those words that clothe a gallant. AstrÃ©e. Zut! Words do not clothe. HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Not a Couturier's words? Without them stitchery were spider-labour. And how were gallants clothed? Cassandre. I would be there! AstrÃ©e. Poor devil! 'Las! Not even a thread to join the tindered rents! 'Las, I have pityâ'las! Cassandre. I, none! Our King has none. Close to those flames, That glow the bed, he waits to see the losel Burn into dust. HÃ©loÃ¯se. Not for religion's sake. AstrÃ©e. But for our Mistress' sake, and for her cause. Cassandre. Think of the infamy, the jibe! A preacher To swear she had infected France, to roarâ When she made mention of a Catholic, And ever-living doctrine of her faithâ âMix not your ordure with God's Sacred Things.â Those were his words. AstrÃ©e. Ordure! [They all laugh. Cassandre. A stable-groom Had hardly tongued the word this Huguenot On his rank breath flung at Our Sovereign-Duchess, And flung before the flashed eyes of the King! HÃ©lÃ¨ne. I would be there to see the Kingâ His eyes, his white plumes sharp on his white hair, Such hair of April snow, And his white feathers like the milkier blossoms Dangling and laughing at the snow! Our King Adorable! His Paris loves him well, His Court and all the ladies of his Court . . . He lifts you a dropped fanâ AstrÃ©e. Your own is broken. How often have you let it fall, ma chÃ¨re? HÃ©lÃ¨ne. And I am told he was a boy so awkward A lady's trinket falling at his feet Appalled him as a spectre. AstrÃ©e. La Vieille Has wrought him debonair and unembarrassed. And how his laugh is softâa little brisker With us and Marie Stuart and his children Than with our Mistress! [AstrÃ©e turns to the book. I am curious. . . . Girls, La Vieille is busy with her Plato. See, the King's portrait stamped upon the boards In gold upon the brown. . . . See this! [A poem in the King's handwriting slips from the book. The Demoiselles gather round, elbowing each the other for a sight of the manuscript. HÃ©lÃ¨ne. A poem of the King'sâthe adorable, The last chivalrous King. Cassandre (laughing and reading). HÃ©las, mon Dieu, combien je regrette Le temps que j'ai perdu en ma jeunesse. AstrÃ©e. Combien de fois je me suis souhaitÃ© Avoir Diane pour ma seule MaÃ®tresse. HÃ©loÃ¯se. Mais je craignais qu'elle qui est dÃ©esse Ne se voulÃ»t abaisser jusque-lÃ  De faire cas de moi . . . Diane has entered in hunting-gear, with every sign of weariness and dejection; but a smile breaks over her face as she lays a hand on HÃ©loÃ¯se's shoulder. Diane. Undress me, child . . . [The Demoiselles in confusion stand round Cassandre, who holds the poem. Yet stay! This is the bearer Of a king's letter . . . for my hand. Present it . . . Retire! [Cassandre, HÃ©lÃ¨ne and AstrÃ©e go out. (To HÃ©loÃ¯se.) Undress me, child. [HÃ©loÃ¯se removes her hunting-gear and lays round her the loose silver robe, completely covering her. HÃ©loÃ¯se. Full moon, Madame la Duchesse, a full and argent moon! Diane (searches the face of HÃ©loÃ¯se). You shall read to me a little, HÃ©loÃ¯se. Stay, you may read me perhaps to sleep. [She takes the face of HÃ©loÃ¯se between her hands. HÃ©loÃ¯se, is there any that you love? [In terror the girl struggles from her gaze. HÃ©loÃ¯se. Madam is weary; Madam must not occupy herself with the heartânothing is so fatiguing. But, if Madam will deign to look in her long mirror, she will see what will delight . . . Diane. No, HÃ©loÃ¯se. HÃ©loÃ¯se. From the window and reflected again in the mirror, are the flames of the bonfire lighted at noon for Monsieur le Couturier. If Madam would deign to raise herself . . . [Diane leans on her elbow and gazes out. Diane. So, to purge what is noxious from the air! . . . So, to make breathing clean! HÃ©loÃ¯se, you must never give your heart to a heretic. Rose-red!âI shall not sleep. How the flower dances for me in the mirror! HÃ©loÃ¯se. I shall give my heart to one who is constant like the King. Diane. The King is constantâ HÃ©loÃ¯se. Madam, yes. It makes no difference if Madam is a little slow in her walkingâthe King will curb himself as proudly as a well-trained charger. It makes no difference if at hunt Madam cannot fix the animal pursued, nor the stoop of the falconâno matter! He affects blindness; he is full of sympathy. I shall love a man constant as the King; and then when wrinkled and in years I shall have some one to flatter me with assurance I am beautiful . . . Diane. Would you like to be flattered, HÃ©loÃ¯se? HÃ©loÃ¯se. I should like to resemble you in every point. I should like when I am older to be esteemed; I should like to have great power. Diane. Should you like to be loved when you are old, little, plain HÃ©loÃ¯se? HÃ©loÃ¯se. I cannot conceive that possible. If now I am plain, I have youth; I am in flower. Shall I read to Madam? [She turns over the pages. Though the King has grey hair, he is young. It is as if he had chosen a colour to make his eyes more dark. The white hair is absurd and like a masque, but the King's eyes are melancholy and full of the softness of youth. [Diane goes up to her reading-stand. It is said, Madam, the King has adopted the tint of his hair to match your ownâit is said that, though you will not dye your hair, he has made sacrifice instead. Diane. O HÃ©loÃ¯se, my white skin is mine, and the King's white hair is his own. You do not read to me! Finish the long strip of broidered silver for my cloak. [HÃ©loÃ¯se lays a mirror near the bed. No, HÃ©loÃ¯se, you do not read to me. I think you will be latest married of all among my maidens. [Exit HÃ©loÃ¯se. [Diane looks out steadily at the flame from the heretic's fire. To ash nowâit is flickering down to ash, Even that fire. . . . Lo, every fire Fails, and burns down. . . . More fondly still He loves me, but his tenderness creeps in, And damps the flame. [She rises and looks in her mirror. No goddess, but a woman, And flushed and full of tears. Cardinal Lorraine enters: she speaks in response to his greeting. No, Cardinal; To-day I am with Hecate and the tombsâ Most dusk! Cardinal. With prouder head, With lovelier bloom upon your cheek, your quiver Disordered on the bed. Who has offended? And who must fall? Diane (deeply sighing). . . . Now when we walk together Mine is the heavier tread: he gives me books Dim to my eyes; I lay them down In the little coffer of his giftâfor once My Henri bade me read to him a chanson Of Ronsard, and I could not see; the page Was as a dungeon-wall against my eyes. My gentle Henri! I have learned the chanson By heart, but the King does not ask for it . . . The dew falls not as then when he besought His pleasure in my voice. I failed him; now I shall more often fail. [She lays herself back on her bed. Cardinal. Not if his pleasure be the voice and not While he can break such sighs. Diane. He will be constant, And tender, and fatigue me. Marie Stuart Will play about the rooms, play as a child, And pick me up my kerchief or my missal Caressingly, with long, caressing eyes Loitering on Henri. [With a movement of weariness Diane closes her eyes. Cardinal. Bien! Marie is very noble, very simple; The Court is hersâ The Dauphin's Court; and if you disenchant . . . Is there a bird flown in? The air is limpid! What is it? She is fallen fast asleep. The sculpture, the serenity, the bloom Of marble in its whiteness and its rose! How shall I rally her? She has no age, Save this infirmity of sleepâ The senses disobedient to the wit! Diane! The King more madly dotes on her, Or, shall I rather say, lingers more fond Before the fountain where he finds her goddess, Or the great portrait where he finds her fair. Dieu Sauveur! He is mad to pass her by For statue or for image of herself. She can pace, even as the Church, this woman, A sovereign power: her fame should fill the world: And it will dwindle down a little cloud, Till it become a little cloud and pass. How shall I aid her? To my breviary, No vantage taken of the moment's slackness! Saint Horace! You have here the phrase for herâ [He draws from a fold of his robe a volume of Horace's Odes. (Murmuring.) Diva triformis . . . though in years, By count of time and season, she is mortal And aged as Lyce, when the poet jibedâ (Reading.) Nec Coae referunt jam tibi purpurae Nec cari lapides tempora, quae semel Notis condita fastis Inclusit volucris dies. And yet and yet. . . . Infernal sorcery! [She opens her eyes and smiles. Diane. A little, healing sleep . . . your judgment, Paris? Cardinal. Incomparable Wisdom! Diane. Ay, to-day My beauty is profound, I have no rival: Nothing beneath the sun is of this texture. [She lays her bare arm across her quiver. Cardinal. My creed! Diane. I cannot die! I shall pass on into a perfect age. O Cardinal, and I so love my lifeâ In this I have the goddess, I could count The centuries as days; I could become More beautiful, more golden, softer far, And slip into the goddess, unperceived As Daphne to her laurel-tree. Cardinal. My creed! Diane (laying her hand on the Cardinal's). Yet am I restless as King FranÃ§ois grew In his last sickness. . . . You remember it! How of a sudden Fontainebleau displeased him, As all her woods were grey, and he would speed On to Saint Germain, to La Muetteâon To Demprierre, to Loche: then at Rambouillet, When the end came, as still within the forest, He startled, quickening to those magic sounds That the winds strike. . . . It was held fast By them of saner judgment he was searched And haunted by that stag that is appointed Sometimes to lure and maze men to their death. Whom should it beckon? I were glad to follow. Cardinal. Not you, most gracious SÃ©nÃ©chale. Diane. Not Henri? Cardinal. Nay, nay, the King is of a lusty health. You must not thus contract his joyâdiscretion! If you can bear with such shrewd counsel as The Mouse, that glides behind the royal curtains, Then nibbles at the women's sweets, and tends His whiskers at confession of a crime, Can profferâyou will smile beside the King. These marriages of his fair child and sister To Spain and to Savoy sting him with passion For feasts and tourneys. In the ardency And in the full absorption of the pageant He plays Chevalier to every woman Who challenges his courtesyâ Diane. These jousts, These bridals, and the King to lead the jousts! Cardinal. The King is caught by little brilliant flowers In the parterre, by little brilliant flowers. These brides and . . . yes, Montmorency miscarried; He forced the King; he pressed into his hand A velvet moth: it is the things that flit, Poise of themselves and flit, that are pursuedâ The brides and the young Dauphiness . . . Most honoured, You must not move among the flock unwary. If you could stoop a little! There are arts . . . Enchantress, if you disenchant, the world Is disenchanted. Do not misconceive. A little herbe d'amour in its lithe crimson Shoots to the eye more vivid in desire Than any drooping rose. Diane. Entreat me not, Good Cardinal, to falter from myself. [She stands erect before him. I shall continue . . . While these little flowers, The brilliant flowers of the parterre, change hue Chameleon-like and differ with the days, Self-same I shall abide. Involuntarily she seizes her bow. Henri enters; he pauses before her Henri. The Majesty! And Donec impleat orbemâthe great oath! Diane, you have not heard? It fell on me at vespers in a dreamâ I have sent forth the cartels to the worldâ That all these jousts are solely in the honour Of my sole Princess. Insignificant And foolish pastimes now are like the ripple Of an oar that spreads its ripples to a beach. Yes, Cardinal, it came to me at vespers How for my Lady I should front the world. Cardinal (bowing). Her glory is assured. I would all kings So dreamed across their prayers! [Exit. Henri. Diane, Diane! I am triumphant, carried far away As in a revelation. Though the fires Have burned out all my guiltiness for sin Most heretic, appalling to myself, Yet on your face I found that cloud a sinner Leaves on the mournful eyelids of his God. Then fell on me this glory, given in dreams Of one who rode triumphant in the lists: The gonfalon, the shield, And the plumed helmet, all were of Saint-Michel, Pure white . . . and then the rider's face was turned: He wore your favour, and he wore your smile. Vigour is on me of my single aim To overthrow the chivalry of earth. We will sweep up to heaven! Diane, what is it? Your brow is as the moving clouds. What portent? It cannot be of cloud. [She caresses him, averting her face. Diane. Your visage is too brightâa revelation Too bright, too bright! Henri (clouding). Ma mie, I should not thus have boasted. You misdoubtâ You think this is a legend? I confided My hope to you. . . . 'Tis foolish to confide Hope to a woman, for she dashes it. Diane. Henri, I do not doubt, or if I doubt It is that I can ever live to bear A miracle so infinite, such love. Henri!âCome with me. . . . Listen! There is music Below there in the Chapel. You shall choose More music, and . . . I shall recover strength. [From below the steps leading down to the Chapel at the back a solemn music is heard. Henri and Diane are moving toward the Chapel when Montmorency and Nostradamus enter. Henri. My Master of the Ceremonies, greet him! He is all ours. Diane (holding out her hand). My own! Montmorency (grasping her hand). Then, Madam, 'tis to you I make my prayer, And as your humblest, faithful servitor . . . For I have tidings, rather I should say A warning of such fearful vehemence And evil omenâ Henri (hotly). O Montmorency, How dare you bring the glittering, tainted fears Here, where we have our royalty! Beloved, There is a rumour running through the Court To stop this pageant; a conspiracy To drown your honour. It is jealous spite, Vile, jealous spite! Montmorency, retireâ Be it your business to shut up these mouths; Command the Queen to keep her peace; forbid The spreading of infection by such threat Of my displeasure . . . Nostradamus. At the word of doom? Henri. You are ashen white . . . The liar's hue, my faith! Nostradamus. I am ashen white: so white will be your face Upon the sod, in this appointed joust, If you encounter . . . [At Henri's clenched hand, he retreats. Diane. I would hear this man; I would encounter him. Step forward, kneel, And take an oath of truth. Nostradamus. The King is doomed. Diane (leaning on the shoulder of the King). Henri, speak you to the astrologer. Henri (supporting her). Give us the worst, as you were charged with news Of sorrow to our kingdom. What is written By fate is written, if the moment speak. Nostradamus. You fall and in a duel. Henri. Then indeed You kindle me. Good Nostradamus, welcome!â Not of the poison-bowl, beloved, nor fading Of a slow sickness, nor with glazÃ¨d eyes To leave you . . . sudden, of a sudden stroke, And from my peer, and in some cause of honour Between contending royalties. Look up! Beloved, my life in all its flow Is yours: now in a symbol take my death. Nostradamus. The King is willing for his death, he loves you; They all are willing for their death who love. Leaving the marble of the forcÃ¨d wordâ Will you consent The King shall die in duel? Then dissuade him From entering the jousts where two and two The combatants contend. Montmorency. For sake of France! [Diane seats herself on her white satin bed. You have made for France a king: He sways above us, as a bowering tree Full of deep scents and riches of the treasure Whereof our kingdom hums. Will you cut off This glory? Will you leave our France a desert? [Diane stretches her long hands over her knees. You dare not say you are not moved, you dare not Make light of the inscription on the wall. Diane. No: I am superstitious. . . . No! I have been very ailing, very sad. It may be but the shadow of my sickness That has brought transit of so many shapes Before my eyes. . . . One day I met a royal stag that looked on me With eyes so mournful, lingeringly enslaved, I took it as a token I must die. But it may otherwise be read: King FranÃ§ois Was haunted by a vision such as this . . . He bade us mark how noble was its gesture, Serene in triple-antlered majesty, An hour before his death. I have unbosomed: [In answer to an impatient movement of Henri's. Nor have I yet the clue . . . Nostradamus. Though sad with your own omens and constrained To utter them aloud! Montmorency. What hinders you? Madam, what hinders? It is in your power To stay the lists, to stay all circumstance. Diane (her eyes fixed on Henri's). I cannot stay the lists. Montmorency. He comes, This mighty soothsayer, from the Queen's chamber. The Queen in wifely terror at her dreamsâ Diane. Then she had dreams? Quick, say what she beheld. Nostradamus. She beheld nothing: but a great unrest. Surged in her bosom like an apparition, And coupling this with her anxiety . . . Montmorency. Think, If you should lose your great Chevalier, Madam, You were left desolate. Diane (rising and standing by Henri). That has no force. I cannot stay the lists. [He stoops and kisses her hand. Montmorency. O Madam, You are proud, very cold; you would be famed For an unwavering mind. This is ambition And selfishness of heart and vanity. Diane (closing her eyes). Peace! . . . If it should be vanity! . . . Repeat The omen once again; repeat it slow. Nostradamus. The young lion shall surmount the old, Upon a field of war, in strangest duel; Shall drive his eyes out in a cage of gold, And by two wounds portend him death most cruel. The stars conjure, the stars Conjure us to take warning: you aloneâ Diane. How on a sudden, Stars, Shall I have strength? It may be I believe This thing will come to pass. For there is nothing, Nothing so sure, not even the fashioning In secret of a child's bones in the womb, As dreams of their fulfilment. On his part The King has had a vision: as Saint-Michel He saw himself. Each portent may be death. Montmorency. Madam, let this decide; if you believe The King will perish in this duel, dare you Send him disheartened to the lists? 'Tis murder; We will not see it done, we standing by. Henri. Diane? Diane. The King has had a vision.âHenri! [He puts his arm round her. Henri. We are lovers: we can part. (Laughing.) Pledged to a vision, And honourably, I shall take my death In duel . . . was it not, astrologer? Come, Steward of the Ceremonies, come, Montmorency . . . for I must choose a horse. Diane. Le Turc. [Henri smiles, and lifting his plumed cap, bows low to her and goes out with Montmorency, followed by Nostradamus, who turns at the door, and fixes on her a gaze of reproach before leaving. I will go down into the Chapel, To hear the music. . . . And I go alone. [She caresses a mantle of the King's, thrown down; then, passing to the Chapel, she pauses at the sound of requiem-music played by the organ. And there is music breaking from the tombs! O terrible, for they are lost, these spirits, That are so tempted, being lost, To wander down, and further off, more strange. [She closes her ears. I could have stopped the lists. . . . I am forbidden, And must be Queen down here, among the dead, For my great vanity. . . . I am forbidden! [To funeral music she descends into the chapel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I Paris. The Terrace of Les Tourelles. Under the moon, women and chevaliers, moving in groups, are seen for a moment, and disappear, a few of their words only being heard. Voices. A baby-bride!â The other, Our Marguerite de Valois with the long, Black glances of the King, a lovely woman!â Yet all the chivalry of France, a-ha, For La Vieille and her sixty years! Spring, throw it to the moon!â Let autumn rule, And sapless days, ma mie!â Throw to the moon All colours bold and flourishing! This tourney Is as the end of tourneys, dedicate To snow and to black melancholy.â Hush! The omens, hush! Our Court has ever flourished black and white, And it will flourish black and white to-morrow; And there an end. Hush, hush, the stars will hear. But we of youth and summer, let us dance, If stars wake up or sleep.â Pierre, a dance! Rosette, Rosette! [They go out, leaving Brusquet alone. Brusquet (sitting central on the parapet). They are so busy; but they must take a little rest in sleep; the rest must come. . . . So busy for their graves! So busy, they need no fooling, when they most need the fool. To further end of the Terrace enter Catherine de MÃ©dicis and Nostradamus Catherine. But now, but now . . . Nostradamus. Madam, the naked stars can reveal to us nothing. Catherine. It is from them you have learnt? . . . Nostradamus. In their hour, in the hour of secrecy. Do you bring a priest to the Bible? The Huguenots stare at Scripture: the faithful believe the interpreters. Catherine. O Nostradamus, I believe. Help me, help me! Have you seen deeper from your tower by Les Halles? Have you seen further? You interpret woe! Help me! I cannot lose him. Nostradamus. You cannot! Then persuade his Mistress to entreat . . . Catherine. These things, if they are fatedâshall a mistress snap the threads of destiny? My prayersâare they not stronger? Nostradamus. Look at her! Diane, in white and silver, enters at the other end of the terrace Catherine. Nostradamus, She is toying with the fool. . . . Go to your tower! Watch till the wandering stars are lost, and all The bristled sparks gone out. In ambuscade Of yonder turret I will wait my moment To plead with Madam, for his sake, his life. [Nostradamus goes out, Catherine moves back into darker shade. Brusquet (as Diane looks up at the stars). O Lady Moon, Do you consult the stars? Diane. That were mere fooling. The moon lays back the stars. Pace with me, rogue! I love the wind! This South blows through my blood! It is all rustlingâand the Milky Way. . . . How full of silent mischief are the stars! Brusquet, there is no place for you to-night. Brusquet. No place for folly here, yet you intrude! I go to bed. Diane. The palace rooms Are full of groaning, of discomfiture, And I would keep my buoyancy of spirit To strengthen CÃ¦sar. [Caressing Brusquet. Fool, my Brusquet, feign News of a comet, a dropt star, a signal Of import to the King. Creep to his chamber, And bid him meet me where the fountain plashes A screen to those dark windows full of ears. Brusquet (ruefully). A Cupid, la! Motley between the lovers. . . . Our morose And angry sovereign turns me out of doors: You reinstate meâyou! Diane. Brusquet, I stay Here through the night until the King arrives. [The fool goes off, then turns back. Brusquet. Will it not savour parting, and discourage King Amadis, if you so solemnly Encounter him? They say the moon shines ill On mariners and those that watch in arms. Diane (again looking up exultantly). The King shall hear the music of the spheres, And all the stars in tune. . . . [Exit Brusquet. No prophecy Of things to be, nor who shall fall or rise! I have a peace deep as I read the gold Of my name's letters in the Book of Life: And I must give this peace To my beloved, must give it to the King. [She turns at a movement over the grass. Catherine is at her side and lays her arms and head on Diane's shoulder. My Queen! Catherine. BelovÃ¨d Counsellor! Diane (as they embrace). You seek me? A while ago I caught you bribing the astrologer. What worlds 'twixt him and me! All prophecy, Deep where it wells, is voice of that which is. Catherine. Our King will die to morrow in the lists. . . . Do you not feel it? You will lose him, Madam. Dissuade him from the folly Of this most fatal thing. . . . He will not see me, He laughs me off. But you have felt the presage! [Diane looks away beyond Catherine. Madam, there are some hours Fated as death. . . . I catch upon the air The exhalation of a fatal hour. . . . Do you not feel it? In my hour of childbirth I trusted you; your courage Gave France an heir: now you must save her King. [She grasps Diane's hands. Madam, you do not love him. . . . Have you not felt the presage? But I love him; I cannot see him die. What can I offer Of gold, of jewels, of fair signories? Diane. His wife, you offer bribes? What jewel have you That you can offer me? What fair possession? Catherine. But if to-morrow he should perish, what Would be your recompense? Then you would learn Your truer titles. [In a soft whisper. I should rouse the Court To hiss you from my widowhood. Diane (taking Catherine's face in her hands). Pray for him Night-long, alone, and in our Lady's Chapel; Night-long and in the dark. Go from me now! I am gravely superstitious. To your prayer! The King rides forth to-morrow, on a horse Or white or red, I know not: but he rides. . . . Oh, on Le Turc! Catherine. The King rides forth on the pale horse of Death; And you will not dissuade . . . Diane. The King rides forth Secure in God. [She comes humbly to Catherine. Sweet, you must pray for him: It is the only magic for this hour. You love him! I beseech, Give him the grace and valour of your prayers. Catherine. Ha, you beseech me as I am his wife, His queen, his rightful queen? Diane. I ask your prayers. Catherine. Because our God will hear me, for my wrongs Cry rending in His ear? But you can save the King yourself alone, Without my prayers that are your accusation. No need of meâa motion of your hand's Entreaty, a few words upon your voice, Your suppliant voice harmonious to himâkisses, A little grasping in embrace . . . [Her hands on her breast, she throws back her head, with closed eyes. O Power! If I had power, if I were with the things Attractive on their way. . . . If I had power, The blessedness founded in stars and yielded To persons of affinity with stars. . . . If I might reach out into time and cog Its wheels, or set its hours in beamy whizz; If I could love with such star-brushing will That it was even with the lights of doom, If I had power majestic or but power Of any earthly strain!âPower! Power! [Opening her eyes. O Madam, Could I but leap into your chariot, guide With reins like you and be to him I love As was his cradle-star with his first breath, Or hold his breath from passing! Had I power, Would I beseech a prayer for him! Diane. Our King Has bidden us keep our silence. In the Chapel Pray silently. Catherine. Had I but power, my God! Could power be given me once, at last, nor vain! . . . [With a deep, patient sigh. But I must pray, my King and husband, pray. Re-enter Brusquet Brusquet. Madam! Catherine. Whom seek you? Brusquet (to Diane). Madam, where is Madam, Where is our sovereign Lady? Catherine. Which of us, Fool, do you beckon? Brusquet. Madam, Sovereign Lady, The Palace is distraught! . . . Two maiden-bedsâ Have I not seen them, as indeed a boy And maiden in my folly?âtwo white beds, White with their virgin flowers, stay coveting Your benediction and your sanctity. Two brides desire that you will visit them To give them courage of your brave ensample So to be queens and wives. [While he has been addressing Catherine, Diane has removed to a distance. Catherine. She shrinks away. I will go with you, fool. Where is the King? Brusquet. Still with his armourer. . . . This entrance, Madam; One of Love's passages, and a fool's exit. [They go out through a narrow door. Diane (laughing). The Motley! My fine-witted fool, the jangle Of his bells across the sward! Cajolery How chaste and prudent! Now a matron's cares Will keep us sacred to our loves. . . . What darkness! Another darkness on the wavering dusk More massive, closer in encompassmentâ The King! [They embrace. Then they come forth into the starrier air beyond the shadow of the Palace, by the side of the fountain. As Diane leads him forth. There is no moon. Henri. Is that an augury? Diane. Dullard, I wrestle for a compliment. Am I not perfect Luna? Henri (moodily). Dissonance There was and laughter. Did you send your fool To check me at my prayers? . . . Diane, your laugh! Diane. I will not make confession, not to you, Though I did laugh. Beloved, in all these years I have been aging in your sight and passing Through the russet darks of autumn to this age, You have not laughed. Henri. I lay before my God In prayer to offer you a perfect praise: For, when I strain you to my heart, Diane, I am as bruised, I am made void; it is As I embraced the blessÃ¨d Crucifix, And must fall back and die. If it be boasting, Or if you mock me in this vast attempt, Greater than any ever made by man, To write in fame how I am moved for you; If you reject this service, if it seem Fantastic . . . O Diane, In youth I sang you now and then a verse; You said my letters had a song in them Heard low like music that we do not see; You said . . . And now our lives are paired, and now I have you by me as my breath and live By the wisdom of your counsels, all my state Guided by your great patience, I am dumb, And a remoteness creeps upon our love. I must do something infinite, immense, Before these formal lovers, to transcend! They shall be served, a hundred lances broke; But at the last, and when all mortal strength Is slacked, I will ride forth with a fresh challenge. Diane, I am accoutred of the angels, And in my truncheon is the mass of God. Diane. Henri, my great Lord Love! Henri. But, if you doubt, I am a phantom knight and through my flesh Death will pierce swiftly, Death will break my guard: Or if you credit any auguries, And pray where superstition sits, and take The fumes of sottish magic . . . Diane. If I doubt! Henri, but I have doubted day and night, Since the first day that was our day of love, When you returned from your captivity To find no welcome, and your Spanish eyes Prayed to me from their prison, while the King Bowed over Madam d'Heilly with a kiss. I doubted. Henri. Well you mightâa boy, an owl Blinking the light from his captivity! Diane. Yea, I did doubt . . . Henri. The twelve long years of kingship offered you? Diane. And still I doubted. Never have we spoken Together of our love! Henri, I doubted If I could so suffice you. Henri. Goddess! Diane. Yea, To you, my great Lord Love. [They are fast clasped. Henri. But now. . . . Not now! If I should die! There are the auguries. Diane. Nay, we have often read of Amadis, How he passed under the Enchanted Arch Built to pronounce true lovers, how his name Broke from a silver trumpet's mouth, with vent Of flowers showered down, and how at last he strove To the Forbidden Chamber: when you stooped And wondered at the story as you read, I laughed a little at your jealousy; But while your eyes burnt on, my Amadis, I heard your name and 'mid strange elements I only saw your triumph. Can I doubt? But every night and on hard stones I pray So to be loving even as I am loved. Go forthâgo in! Henri. Embrace me! Diane. No! Our loves resume as softly as the stars. Go inâgo forth! [Henri slowly turns back into the darkness. Scene II Paris, Rue Saint Antoine. A curve of the lists, facing the seat of Diane as Queen of Beauty. She sits central, dressed in cloth of silver and black velvet cloak. Brusquet is by her, in a coat of many stripes. Her women sit behind. FranÃ§ois de Guise with the Cardinal of Lorraine press round her. Cardinal. Burning Julyâhot by the river! Hot, Par Dieu!âand cloudless. What of augury? Is Nostradamus sheltered while the welkin Is broad in smile against his quiddities? A hundred lances broken! Brusquet. Yea, a hundred, All broken!âso the world is formed to wag! A hundred lances, and our Sovereign swears A hundred lances must be broken . . . then He will break lance, O Madam, for your sake. A hundredâay, ay, worldâand one beyond! Diane. Brusquet, you darken Nostradamus even With riddles of the dark. Cardinal. Ho, Brusquet, there! Your book is lying open on your lap, Your little motley book of the world's fools. Let 's see . . . my name. [Lifting up the book. Guise. O villain fool, a lady's! Cardinal. Goddess, forgive, nor turn us as your hounds To rend this infamous Acteon's patches. Diane. My name!âWe rend a jest If we explain it. Brusquet, I am written Largest of fools. . . . Be rent and speak me clear! Guise. Justice deserved! Cardinal. Fool, lift your stomach toward your mighty head, And so pluck courage for your death. Explain! Brusquet. Who risks the hundred for the one, May find his hundred drawn and spunâ Oh, for the odds!âhis counting done! [Brusquet shivers. Diane. Is it a quaking tertion on you, Brusquet? . . . No, noâa little greyness in the sun . . . A drowse of life about the tribunes. Hark! The lists so sudden quiet, as if the silence Itself were calling. Monsieur le Duc, what is it? Guise. A little silence: such As comes in celebrations when the glory And feast dread time. . . . So soon our fÃªtes are over, Always these little pauses come in joy: Even at the Holy Mass have you not known them? Diane. How vacant!âNay, who rides up tall and strong? All. Your black and whiteâour King. Vive, vive le roi! Diane. High on Le Turc! Voice (heard). Must I believe, my lieges, This kingdom France holds no good lances more? Guise. A ringing note! Cardinal. Who 's that?âOld Vieilleville In protest? Would he close the glowing lists? Ungenerousâbecause his belly's knoll Is sinking into table-land for dinner. These grey, old guzzlers at a tournament! Montmorency joins the group Montmorency. Listen! A challenge! Peace! Herald. I, Henri, King of France, challenge Monsieur de MontgomÃ©ry, Comte de Loche, in tourney to prove his lance and truncheon before Diane the Queen of Beauty and the Goddess of all Radiance. Guise. A famous lance, a man Of sudden angers red along the neck. These Scotchmen! Montmorency. MontgomÃ©ry's answer. Hush! Herald. I, Gabriel de MontgomÃ©ry, Comte de Loche, take up the challenge of my liege-lord, King Henri, to tourney, and will prove my lance and truncheon before Diane the Queen of Beauty and the Goddess of all Radiance. Cardinal (to Diane). What did you kiss? Diane. This little ornament, And for the words. Cardinal. Until it fill the worldâ His Donec Impleat Orbem . . . and his gift. Diane. His promiseâoh, it lightens down on me; And we must act our homage to our glory When Heaven fulfils . . . (To Brusquet.) What are you writing now? Brusquet. The name. Diane. What name? Brusquet. His that is France. All. The King's! Brusquet. When one has struck and noon is gone, Rest still nor gird your armour on, Until the sun is set that shone. Poor fool, poor foolâ I am a'tremble though the wise have felt No slacking of their sinews, though our whitest Of fools half-rises to the sovereign fool Who tempts not Heaven, but number and the odds. Guise. Peace from offence, fool. They face gallantly. [Below Henri appears on his charger; he salutes Diane; she smiles fearlessly down. Cardinal. O rapt sight of the mysteries! Brusquet. O madness! [Henri retires; there is a sound of encounter heard. Montmorency. Parbleu! Diane. His guard is broken? Montmorency. Hush!âHe sits . . . The strongest seat in France or in the world. Cardinal. So PhÅbus sits his car. God pardon me, I thought an instant Phaeton seared our eyes. All. Vive, vive le roi! . . . le Turc! Diane. Magnificent! Would that MaÃ®tre LÃ©onard were here on earth To see a horseman level with his art. Le Turc swept like a sea the mighty curve That brought his rider stable. What applause! . . . I have forgot the cymbals of my palms. Let 's sound him a triomphe . . . Montmorency. They are recrossing, Madam. Diane. At turn of the event no acclamation . . . Stillness. . . . Gone, gone the breath of all the field. Montmorency. Ha! Guise. The King fallsâby MontgomÃ©ry's fault, He kept his broken lance, and splinters it Against his sovereign's visor. (To Diane.) Have no fear. An accident of but a minute. Cardinal. Duchesse, They have untangled him. Le Turc is free. Diane. Le Turcâfree! Guise. They have drawn the King below. Montmorency. Murdered before our eyes in wantonness, Our Lion, our King! [He descends. Henri is brought in below among exclamations and whispers. Le Docteur Vesale supports his head. Catherine de MÃ©dicis rushes to him. Diane remains transfixed, standing white in the tribune. They unfasten the visor. Catherine. His fate, his very fate! The cage of gold, the eyesâO cruel death! Cries. She swoons . . . and he has swooned. Catherine (rousing herself). Struck, torn! His fate has rent him, as was told, But left him mine at last. . . . (To le Docteur Vesale.) Not dead, not yet? Vesale. No, Madamâno! Catherine. Bear him away from all malevolence Of aspect, from the evil lights of darkness; Bear him away to me at Les Tourelles. My King, own husbandâHenri! Raise him up, Bear him awayâmy cloak beneath his knees. Gently. . . . Remove, remove! I am here for him. O Doctor, how the flux of blood creeps up Out of his eyeball! Jesu Maria, lift him To pillows . . . Henri!âSoft, to Les Tourelles! Henri! [He is borne out, Catherine clinging to his fallen hand. Cardinal. Be ready at Queen Catherine's side! This stroke turns graveâthe blood profoundly welling, No knowledge of himself. Guise. I am with the Queen. [He descends. Diane (suddenly). He is not there. . . . Brusquet. O dearest of all fools! [He weeps. Diane. Where are they gone . . . the little figures twisting Or running round a spot I could not see? Empty!âAll gone away. . . . Monsieur le Cardinal, Will you win entrance for me to the King. Oh, it is pain! And he will cry, will waken. . . . God pity him! Pray you, win entrance for me Monseigneur, to his Majesty! [Cardinal Lorraine descends. Gone too! Brusquet, fetch news. . . . I say it with my lips, But feel all news is gone to echo now, Wandering the Seine and garden-trees. Dear Brusquet, One thing Love rulesâthat I be overthrown With my great Knight. Go, plead for me, entreating The Queen, by her fair mildness and old friendship, She grant me but one touch of the King's hand, To give him peace in anguish. Humble me, As vanquished on the lists. Run! run! Brusquet. Fool's errand, Madam! But you are written in one bookâmy kindred. Keep this for pledge I go. [He tosses her his book and leaves her. Diane. The precious name Washed outâtears drowning all the characters. Brusquet! . . . Tears, tears! [Turning. My women, doves before the hawk! . . . My women, We are indeed left bareâthe hawk at poise. Gather your veils and fans. This privacy Of ours is public to the crowd. . . . Yet wait! Some one approaches. . . . Pain, his pain! My Henri! Enter Messenger Messenger. Madame de Valentinois, you are bidden Retire yourself from Court, at the Queen's pleasure, To your domain, restoring the crown-jewels In sum and kind, then forthwith leaving Paris. Diane. Is the King dead? Messenger. No, Madam, but will die; The surgeons and physicians speak him dying. Diane. No master have I while his Majesty Has life but in one finger; and I fear No enemy: but when he shall be dead My sorrow will forget all injuries Or insult in the vastness of its world. For should he die, as the ascended moon, Full to completion of the dead sun's lightâ World of its worldâI should reiterate His shining till I set. I have no light Of Mercury or Jupiter or Mars, Nor any splendid planet, nor any star, Nor luminary spangled on the heavens, Nor darting 'mid the air, except my sun! And from him onlyâmy bright sun!â The favourable kindness of his grace. Messenger. Madame la Duchesse, Catherine, Queen-Regent of the Realm of France, Requires of you the ChÃ¢teau of Chenonceaux, Sequestered from the throne . . . Diane. ChÃ¢teau Chenonceaux Was never of my title as is Anet; But held of living gift while the great giver Breathes breath of life. The gift is unannulled, The King . . . God's mercy soothe him!âbeing alive. Messenger. You must obey the Queen, Madame la Duchesse. Diane. Here we are public: seek us in our house. [As the Messenger leaves, Brusquet returns. Brusquet. Fool's errand, Madam! . . . Soothe! She would not let you pass the palace-threshold, Not passâ Diane. I have bowed down my soul. I enter My Hell, where is no ChristâLove at a distance, And every hour in sufferings and in fire . . . Henri! . . . Christ come to us! [She weeps, groaning. Brusquet. Brave, blessÃ¨d Lady, The little MÃ©dicis weeps too. Diane (drying her tears with her silver veil, as she gathers her cloak round her). She weeps! To Anet, womenâto the little Chapel. [Perceiving Goujon standing quietly near her. O Anet, Anet, Anet!âsafe, MaÃ®tre Jean, the Dream safe, and fast-sealed! My Henri Reared me his Castle of Love's Holy Grail On my own land, and there I have possession: Those woods will flow Their alleyed sun across my tears; for ever The fountains throb their source, and the clear image Of our great dream, in many a dream, enmesh me To my far-banished King, that everywhere Among the mirrors and the golden tissue Of glasses, and the grisailles of the panes, Among the balustrades and lovely doorways, The statues and sky-fixed enamels, Henri Will meet me in his presence, for we twain Are by the very substance of our love With beauty consubstantial. To all ears Save yours, my Goujon, and to Palissy's, Or Cousin's, or my Philibert de l'OrmÃ©'s, How cold such words!âbut not to yours, my love Being safe in consecration as your dreams, High and still kindled as the heavenly moon. And if he dieâmy one, my sovereign joyâ His death will reach me, in a breath about, Not of the forest coolness any more, But infinite, set free from a deep heart That is the depth of mine. . . . If he shall die, You will at Anet raise my sepulchre, Where you have raised me Goddess of his youth . . . [Suddenly, with a moan. But oh!âhis pain, and the impassable, The torturing gulf! How I am shut from him, And he from me! . . . Christ come to us in Hell! Oh, for Death's nearnessâwhen the dead at large Find closer ways to life than when they lived! . . . Christ come to us! My Henri, none will pass Save one that is divine between us now. From where I am to where you are none pass . . . Henri!âthe great gulf fixed! [She goes out, folded in her silver veil. Brusquet takes up his little book she has dropped and follows her in front of her women. Goujon. Goddess of Heaven, She is the Moon left in Love's Universe, That cloudless brow of hers, those languorous lids! Now she becomes an effigy, as noble As the firm glory it perpetuates, Old, but as marvellous old marbles age: And half her years' Unconquerable legend we salute! For her the Dream, for her a Sepulchre, And I to serve her till she fill the world. Scene III Paris. Les Tourelles: the King's bedchamber. Henri is stretched motionless in stupor. Catherine de MÃ©dicis lies prone on the floor, near the bed. The royal ladies, the Dauphine Marie Stuart, the Princesses and the Brides of the late festivity, all dressed in white, stand round. The ConnÃ©table Anne de Montmorency and the Cardinal de Lorraine bend over Catherine. It is growing dusk. Cardinal. Madam, not as the very grave to lie In hopeless sorrow were a Catholic And humble sorrow. Raise yourself and drop The groaning paternosters one by one, Yet from eased heart. Montmorency. Madam, rise up! Take comfort. Cardinal. Your hand! Catherine (kneeling as his hand draws her from prostration). That he should die! O Cardinal, He will be dead to-morrow: and if dead . . . It is the gulf that we have leapt across Dazes us: what were any pit before To one behind and traversed, memory Booming and toiling of the phantom years On years in requiem helplessness. Cardinal. O Madam, You have a king, your son, and this young daughter [Showing Marie Stuart. Catherine (on the breath of a whisper). My poor, frail boy, my FranÃ§oisâking! His queen, young, fresh, unwrinkled! (Patiently.) Must we wait, Wait still? . . . O Cardinal, they cannot rule! We are Queen-mother in the realm, and Regent, If we are widowed. . . . Regent. Marie, child! Come, let your uncle see me kiss you . . . Regent! You, the young Queen of France! There, leave me, friends; And, children, spread your white veils round your knees Before the altar. [The ConnÃ©table and the Cardinal withdraw. There is profound silence and the dropping of beads. Husband! [It is dark now, and the altar-lights fall on the white dresses of the beadswomen. Of a sudden Catherine stands up. Why, how strangely And utterly familiar! (She looks round). The black night, The black-browed bed, standing, a catafalque; And then this whiteness lit on shade and gloomâ A whiteness from the satin and the pearl Of brides in bridal dress. . . . What have I seen In life, in all his lifeâwhat have I seen? What does my memory implacable See ever but this wedded black and white? And I, if I would mourn him, must assume The colours of my rival and the badge Of his unfaithfulnessâthe black and white, In death as life! [She throws herself prone: after a moment she rears her head. But, Henri, when you die, The jewels, the crown-jewels, all your giftsâ By rote I know them, tabled every oneâ These shall be rendered to the Widow-Queen As to a Treasurer, firm, coloured things; Though for your sake, belovÃ¨d, I must take, And must adopt and wear by day, by night, Her colours, even as you: and I shall wear them While I am breathing in the lonely world. Among us only black and white . . . on me Ermine and sable, for I am a queen, Queen-mother, Regent of my husband's realm, And Regent of my dying son. . . . This queen, This Marie Stuart, young, ambitious, favouredâ [In a loud voice. Pray by your private altars, leave me silence! . . . I am to lose my husband, dress in black, Trail the white ermine. . . . I am full of faintness I am to lose my husband. . . . What are children, Dying from year to year, by the strait loss And central of their father? Leave your prayers! Put out the candles. . . . Hush! I would not see The gulfs that teem this faintness; go! [They pass out, as she moves towards the bed. My Henri, Black, white for evermoreâfor evermore Our triple doom! O Henri, but to-dayâ Am I not still in gold and red to-day? Whose is the hour? He stirs . . . his cry will follow; Time has defeated the kind medicine. The cry will rend me. [She hurries to the anteroom. Monsieur Vesale, help! Henri. Oh, oh! Torn all to pieces and alive! A stagâ As when the biting hounds leap on its haunches, And the poor, royal head must register Death-agonies of prorogation, torn! Hounds on me . . . and I cannot die. Torture beyond the pains of death! [He moans deeply. Aloneâ Diane, your royal stag, and run to ground! A wilderness, the dogs, the panting air; The frenzy. . . . O the vortex of mad teeth! [He moans again. Catherine de MÃ©dicis and le Docteur Vesale approach the bed. Catherine. He criesâyou hear! Vesale. This poppy should allay his martyrdom, His tortured crying-outâthe brain being torn With fatal laceration. Henri. Give it meâ To drink, to end . . . Vesale. Nay, Sire . . . Henri. Not to the wound! [Turning to Catherine. Or send me my one salve, You keep from me, Madam, my Watch-and-Ward! Send me my salve! Doctor . . . Be human! Doctor, Tell me the one true thing: has she not pleaded To visit me? She ever cared for beauty, The statues with their polished, perfect brows; But yet . . . Be human, tell me the one truth, Mid all this calenture of brain and sight, In which what seems is nowise what it is, That she has pleaded. Vesale. Peace! Keep still nor fret! Will not the gracious lady Thank us if you shall heal. Henri. Stop, Catherineâlisten! listen! In the deep nights I came to you, your husband: I came of her persuasion all these nights. Are you not left Queen-mother of a race She guards with care, as Artemis the young Of the enfolding forests? Pity her! I am swift-dying of such agonies As master reason. . . . Let me feel her hand, To nip, when the pain gnaws me, her dear ringsâ The jasper dragon with its sparks and beams, The ring of the four metals, and the ring Made spireways with the pointed diamond-stone And perfect balay ruby. . . . Oh, her touchâ As the moon's on the substance of the sea, Garnering all its madness, she celestial! Oh, her still touch! . . . Doctor, she prayed to come? Catherine. Fret not! If you recover she will thank us. Henri, my life, Do not wrest off the poppy; let my fingers Press solace on the gash. O Henri, Henri, You have confessed; God's oil is on your senses, You are prepared for wayfaring and safeâ You are prepared for wayfaring by God. . . . And in His sight, Henri, I stand your wifeâ His mercy bathe you! Turn to me, O Henri! Through twenty years of dream you have rejected The wife who, virtual, loved you as her husband Through famished girlhood to stale yesterday: Who now is as a dog beside your body, A dog beside his stricken master's body, Keeping a foe at bay. Henri. But it is savageâcruel, How they divide us.âAs in Amadis De Gaul, the hands, that beat upon the air, Battling and hindering up the fatal perrons, The iron and the marble and the copper, Amadis fought through to the wondrous Chamber Where he and Oriana should be joined. Remember me, O Dian, Now at this hour: I pass the line of spell. Doctor, you know the hand was large and hard, An old man's hand, that gathered Amadis To the Forbidden Chamber. Ha, la, la! Take off your fingers, Catherine, take the paddle Of your quick fingers off. Leave me alone! And would you countervail? . . . My only Princess! Through all the roar of voices, the besetting Of strife, O fiends, she the Most Beautiful, Will come to me in the Forbidden Chamber. Doctor . . . Oh, for God's sake, help, help! The girding Of mortal pain! Give me a poppy-draught, Oh, give me death! More poppy! Not this womanâ You, you, old man . . . your hand, your large, hard hand. . . . I know my own heart . . . have no fear. [Clinging to his bedpost. Lady of Succours, help . . . (To Catherine.) Ha, no, no, no! Catherine. I will not leave youâat the very last. I have loved you in the dark as from a tomb, My dying one, and you are mine. I hold you Against all demon powers. . . . Henri (in a low, surprised voice). And from this wandering softness, New-born? O moonlight! I am retired with it. . . . O Moon, increasing, Dewing with silver rills and all my pain A sacred ecstasy! The years all gone! Dian, my Lady, O Most Beautiful In the Forbidden Chamber! Dian, Dian! The ends of youth and age meet soft together, Ah, very soft! I lie, Safe in the growing, glistening silentness Of thy own magic, thy Endymion. Ha! thou hast hunted for me: I am found! Doctor, nurse, priest, who ever presses near, I am lone from you: do not speak . . . No prayer, no touch. . . . I shall lie white in night, And when you come at dawn I shall be dead. Catherine. Henri, my husband! Vesale. Peace!</field>
