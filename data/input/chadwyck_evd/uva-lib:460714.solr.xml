      <field name="fulltext">THE ITALIAN WIFE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. It will be obvious to most readers, that although the scene be laid in Italy, the hint of the plot of this Play has been taken from the romantic old English Tale of Rosamund of Woodstock. The other incidents are purely imaginary, although many stories, of a description not very dissimilar, are to be found scattered through the obscure annals of the petty Italian principalities. It was not without some hesitation that the author ventured to call his performance a Tragedy. If the rigid modern definition of the term be adopted, it has little right to the title. “Tragic Play” would have been less liable to cavil. From modern canons, however, he would appeal to the practice of the English dramatists who preceded the period of the invasion of French criticism, under Charles the Second. Aware that there never was an actual course of events, and scarcely ever an instance of human character of an unmixed description, they took their cue from nature and experience; and boldly joining scenes of levity with those of seriousness, exhibited the “thread of life” of that “mingled yarn,” of which philosophy has never denied it to be composed. They did not deal in characters which are merely personifications of some single passion; nor deem the excellence of a play consisted in its being a sort of cabinet of perfect crystallizations of the hero, the villain, or the saint. If the merit of their method is to be deduced from the effects it produced, there can be little doubt of the result. At all events, it surely must be conceded, that the system of dramatic writing, which, pretending to exhibit nature, sets aside her most pervading law, ought to be supported by logic of no trifling force. Neither should a deviation from such a system be stigmatized as a perverse opposition to some self-evident maxim of universal application. It has been fashionable of late for writers of tragedies to deprecate all idea of their being acted. In the present instance, however, the author may save himself that trouble. Were his scenes, separately, as good as even the vanity of authorship could imagine, its general want of action would inevitably condemn the piece. This is perhaps the only very intelligible disqualification of a dramatic piece for actual performance, provided it be worth publication at all. It is, certainly, difficult to conceive how any thing which can reasonably be styled “dramatic,” should be written without reference to the tones, looks, and action of the persons by whom it is supposed to be spoken, be they mimes or real personages. With respect to the unities of time and of place, the author has been as careless as he could. If, in the former, he has approached in some degree towards that improbable probability in which modern criticism delights, it was by chance rather than by design that he did so. These liberties, together with some others, both of language and versification, he trusts may be forgiven, as they were taken —freely.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Rampart. Enter Sanzio, Pablo, and Frankendall. SANZIO. This is my bound-stone, gentlemen. The soldier, Despite his macaw's coat and peacock's plumes, Must sometimes, as the gayest fowls will do, Keep to his cage. Upon the eastern rampart, If you go on—for there I've seen him walk— Perchance you'll find Count Beltran. FRANKENDALL. Thank you, sir; Your pains already have outgone our need; We'll tempt no breach of discipline. Heaven forbid! Though haply in this dancing time such matters Are lightly overstepp'd.—Signor, how say you? These feasts are excellent to fill up scars; It is a thriving time—is't not? for soldiers, Whose hour of pleasure's bought with twelvemonth's toil, As dear as sweet, and not more sweet than scarce?— This is a lusty service you are in, And like to last. SANZIO. Signor, I wish it may. FRANKENDALL. Nay, pardon us, sir; there are no rivals here— None of those gallants who will wish men joy E'en in the hope of making cuckolds of them. We blame you not; for we are old enough To fare well, nor cry “roast-meat!” SANZIO. Sir! PABLO. Come, comrade, We are no spies; and yet you're in the right. “Hush!” is the primal virtue of a court, And a dumb woman there is twice a treasure. A man had better have a roving wife, Than keep a gadding tongue. SANZIO. Signor, you're merry, But not less wise—'Tis the best dog at court Who runs the trail, yet never once gives mouth. FRANKENDALL. Well, sir, what we would say might be proclaim'd At th'market cross. Florence, we say, is merry, And long may't be so; and long live the Prince! And may he still, to our high-blooded Princess, Prove a most gentle husband! SANZIO. Gentle?—Ay, That will he.—Signor, to be plain with you, Long live the Prince say I!—It is my duty, Both as a soldier and a citizen. Yet if a man may pray for any change In his liege lord, why Sanzio would make bold To wish him more o' the first. PABLO. How say you? SANZIO. Sir, My lord, Ignatio, is a prince, most noble— A soul impregnate with all gentle qualities— Clad in all learning that adorns a man— Set off with every courtesy—(albeit, I speak but as a soldier, and so take me)— He is a man that to a tale of love Will yield a sigh; that to a tale of pity Hath ready tears in payment; and will listen, Enraptured, to the lutanist nightingale That charms, at eve, with many a moonlight cadence, The fairy-haunted Arno. But he'll shrink From a hand-stirring tale of war or strife, As doth the maid whose mother never chid her Beyond a cloudy look or ominous finger.— Now these are worthies peace builds statues to, But under whom our faulchions still are apt To gather rust; ay, and our cloaks wax old With goodly household wear the while; God wot, No very tiptoe prospect for a soldier! FRANKENDALL. Pshaw!—Man, ne'er revel in these black forebodings. The moths of peace eat up a soldier heart whole! Blood, body, bones; ay, plumes and sword and all; And then grace after meat!—Trust me, impossible! Dooms-day is none so near. Pooh! cheer up, comrade; Why, our high-spirited Princess,—to whom Heaven Grant large increase of beauty, and of children, All mettled like their mother,—shall find out Rare wars for him; ne'er fear it. SANZIO. Truly, sir, There's some hope that way.—Well, old tedious Time, When the commencement is well nigh forgotten, Shall haply condescend to tell the end, As prosers wont to do.—Your pardon, gentlemen; I'm signall'd. FRANKENDALL. Sir, good morrow. To the eastward You say we'll find Count Beltran. Thank you, Signor. 'Tis time we met his highness. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Another Part of the Rampart. Count Beltran —alone. I have oft dream'd that I o'ertrod this rampart; But not in guise like this. The thought was idle, Perhaps; and yet it was a thought, not dream; For it would grow and struggle in my bosom, As if 'twere pregnant with some life of truth, Which time and fortune must one day bring forth Into substantial consequence and effect. No matter—'tis an idle retrospect. I little thought, once, to have paced me here, Giving a dull eye to the morning air, And a parch'd lip, to dissipate those revels, Where every mounting laugh and joyous shout Lanced to my heart's core, like the feather'd shaft, Deeper, for being plumed. Well, well; we'll see. I'll dice it out. Though the first cast be lost, The game's not play'd. Play'd! no; am I not school'd In that controuling pastime, which can wait With steady eye the passage of the herd, And hear the eager din on every side, Till 'tis the time to shoot?—I loved her not; Or, say I did; how did I?—Not as fools do— Not for a flower of some miraculous hue, That must be ever fed with amorous sighs, And water'd with fresh tears. None such for me; But as a splendid guide, to hand me up The glassy steep to fortune. As a lover, She knows me not; or else, but knows me as One who is haply proud enough to sue— Too proud to be denied. My birth's obscured, 'Tis true; and yet part of her blood is mine. The chaste star that o'erhung my sire's nativity, Might blush when he was moulded—not the more Averse for that. She still hath call'd me “Cousin;” Then why not “Husband?”—How, now, gentlemen. Enter Frankendall and Pablo. FRANKENDALL. Good morrow to your highness. BELTRAN. Gentlemen, Good-morrow both. Why, Frankendall, how haps it Thou meet'st the laughing morn with such a pale And most unwonted seriousness?—Has Florence Exhausted even thy store of sweet behaviours, Which was, methought, exhaustless? FRANKENDALL. Faith, my lord, I know not how it is. Yet, by your leave, Your brow, methinks, keeps mine in countenance. BELTRAN. Perchance it may.—Well, I'll have no more revels— No parchment cheeks, pursed brows, and eyes of lead. By Heaven, a man had better be a scrivener Than earn them thus in tedious junkettings!— We'll tender our farewell in this night's feast, And so set forth to-morrow. Pablo, you Shall not forget. PABLO. Trust me, my lord. BELTRAN. Call all My train together by the dawn of morning. In the meantime, confer with Jacomo; Let him mature that which I spoke about; And look that nought's forgot. Now, Frankendall, What is't o'clock? [Exit Pablo. FRANKENDALL. Upon the step of seven, Unless the dial lies. We had been here Some half an hour ago, but that we met An officer of the Duke's, whose courtesy Somewhat delay'd us. Faith, a sound, shrewd wit, And one that hath the true divining rod, That points which way gold lies—a marvellous touch Of what we call the keen; but wise withal, And by my troth, a thorough-bred court lurcher, For all his honest outside—one that tracks And mouths not. But I trench upon your highness. BELTRAN. Did I not ask thee what it was o'clock? FRANKENDALL. Some minutes short of seven. BELTRAN. I had forgotten. Your pardon. FRANKENDALL. Nay, it is not needed yet; Or, if it be, I shall be even with you, And soon, perchance, my lord. But seriously— Take what I say in the same strain 'tis meant, And the board's clear enough,—I have observed, Since we came here, to solder up this match Between two metals, none o' the likeliest, A weight upon your brow; and that I did E'en now perceive it heavy, I made bold To say your looks kept mine in countenance; Which, if they wore some gravity, in sooth, It was because I could not shut my eyes And blink your heaviness. I have said, my lord— But if there's aught that Frankendall can do— BELTRAN. I know't. Thou need'st not trumpet thy affection, For thou art ill at that. I'll trust thee, Frankendall— Why should I not? for thou hast been to me An elder brother; nay, a very father. And what is there to trust? thou'lt say't. FRANKENDALL. My lord, This will I say—I am your friend. If all Had said as little, and had done as much, You had been saved some grief. BELTRAN. Ay, my poor sister; Well, she is dead. FRANKENDALL. Nay, nay; that follows not. The hag who fled with her, 'mid the confusion Of that fell night, had itch enough for gold, But none for blood. Why, she saw ghosts, and durst not, No, durst not, for a ducat, and that's much, Have cross'd a churchyard at the gloomy hour, E'en with a saint for convoy. BELTRAN. Frankendall, Thou triflest. But take this with thee, my friend; Thou hast the very cypher of my brow, And truly read'st what's written. This same marriage Which thou, I know not why, call'st ill assorted, Sticks in my bosom, Frankendall. FRANKENDALL. Why, the vengeance! Kept you this hid till now? BELTRAN. I never dream'd, When Cosmo died, that she, thus out of hand, Would wed his chalk-faced brother. FRANKENDALL. Had you only Declared your love, we had found means to further't. BELTRAN. Love! thou mistak'st; thou mean'st to say ambition. I'll ne'er pass muster in the sighing regiment. But, if I did, the marble of that brow, Though it outvie the stainless alabaster, Were not the charm for me. I tell thee, Frankendall, I have more sympathy with a pair of eyes And a soft tongue—though seen and heard but once— That pointed me my way, twelve hours ago, Than aught Ignatio's blest with. FRANKENDALL. Why, my lord, Methinks your fancy's ta'en a wayward fit. Where was this wonder? BELTRAN. By the river's side, Cross from the city, where the drooping thickets Invade the stream, and many a laughing blossom Sports with the loitering waters—a slight wicket Oped, and within there stood, retiringly, Oh! such a shape, with such soft sunny locks, Match'd with two heavenly eyes, which seem'd akin E'en to the stars they rivall'd. In brief accents She told me of my way; but never feet Felt less alacrity than mine did then To obey such sweet directress. FRANKENDALL. Nay, my lord, Florence improves you. Stay another month, And you shall warble canzonets and madrigals. BELTRAN. Thou jestest, Frankendall. Yet thine experience Must know that there are looks, and tones, and features, Will find their way through the most stubborn breast, And print them on the heart, though it were iron, Felt, and forgotten never.—Wherefore this, Heaven only knows! But let us not mock, Frankendall, Intents so free from any taint o' the earth— So spiritual and pure from smack of grossness— Because they're fancy-bred—Creations delicate Of the clear soul, which roves where it will rove, And makes and unmakes at its liking, still Baffling our proudest wisdoms. These are promptings We cannot fathom, but we should not scorn. FRANKENDALL. I've done, my lord. This only let me say— Go not to-morrow. Let these tangling fancies Enmesh your purpose for a day or two; So, at the least, they're profitable. In The interim, pay your duty to the Princess; There's policy in't. If this same lukewarm wedlock Do not grow cold; and that upon the sudden, Never trust bachelor more. BELTRAN. Thou talkest strangely. I understand thee not. FRANKENDALL. Nor I, my lord; So far, I have but hints, and vague ones; yet There is a way to ripen them to facts. BELTRAN. Ay, now thou speak'st. Here, take this purse of ducats, And by to-morrow morning— FRANKENDALL. No; no gold. BELTRAN. No gold? FRANKENDALL. No gold!—We start at filthy lucre. Praiseworthy emulation, good my lord, No more.—'Tis true, an honourable post Sometimes brings gold, but how can we help that? 'Tis pity, for the world's censorious! BELTRAN. Begone! 'Tis time we hied us to the palace. To-morrow I shall look to hear more news. FRANKENDALL. To-day, or I shall never be a prophet. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —The Interior of a Villa on the Arno. Eulalia —alone. It is in vain. There is a string of woe, Which, having once been touch'd, jars sadly on, At discord with the rest; and to attempt To waken other tones, but serves to make The dissonance apparent—I'll not do't. False Patience, thou but wil'st us on to bear, But mak'st no pang the lighter. Oh! my child, Where shall we shelter us? We know no kindred, Save him who casts us off; and if we did, Would they not shut the door on us in scorn, As to a loathsome beggar! Break my heart! Lost, lost, Eulalia!—Flow on, hopeless tears— I have no minist'ring hand to wipe ye off; No friend to counsel; no consoling crowds To flock to tell me I have lost my husband. Husband!—I had no husband,—Is he not Another's?—False Ignatio! what a widow, What a forsaken self-despairing wretch Thou hast made of poor Eulalia!—Cruel, cruel! Worlds had not bribed her to have shrunk from thee. She would have died resolved, and spoke no word, E'er she had breath'd an accent of the rite, Or ta'en a morsel of the marriage feast, That would have torn her from thee! Treacherous man! Who call'st thyself so godlike. Oh! how can'st thou Shew thee so base? How poor a stay has she Who leans upon thy bosom for support! And, yet, where can she lean, if not to thee? The power that framed the ivy gave the oak; But woman, who can nothing else than love, With but false man to love—where shalt thou cling? To Heaven? what else. And if, Ignatio, Thou hast lost me e'en that refuge, say what pangs, What writhings of the mind, what hot remorse, What cold despair, what nighted destitution, Were bad enough for thee? I'll think no more, Perchance I wrong him; and I would not wrong him Even for Heaven—however I be wrong'd. —What do I say?—He look'd so pale and faulter'd, And his knees trembled, and his cheek turn'd ashy, As if the frighted blood had rush'd in terror Back to the o'erlabour'd heart. Alas! alas! How have I wrong'd him?—He is broken-hearted; And yet must strive to smile, and hide the pain That gnaws his life away. No kindly bosom To trust his tale to—none to offer comfort— No eye to weep with him—no brow to droop— His lot doth fellow mine. Wretch that I am, To add one pang to such a pile of grief! Is it not harder still? Oh, misery! To breathe in pain, and be denied to sigh, To yearn, to weep; and dare not shed one tear. Renounce me, O ye Heavens! if ever more I do not pray you, bless my 'lorn Ignatio, If you would bless Eulalia. These are footsteps— There's some one comes. They shall not see me weep. Let me be firm—firm. [Exit. Enter Giovanni. Not here!—I am almost glad on't; for, poor lady, Her grief's past help; and we still shun to see The ill we cannot med'cine. What a gloom, E'en to my eye, wraps these once pleasant walls;— Well, poor Ignatio—I must do his bidding: I will search further. She has been here lately; Those books, and this unused negligence, Whisper as much. Enter Eulalia. Now rest you well, fair madam; I would confer with you, so I intrude not. EULALIA. Intrude? No, no; pray use no ceremony; I am not worth it now, and want it not. Signor, your pleasure? GIOVANNI. If it grieve me, madam— And credit me that it does inly wrench me— Only to gaze on grief like that of yours, How sad an office must it be to minister Between that grief and its regretful cause? I come with speech from my unhappy friend— The Prince—Ignatio. Pardon me, sweet lady, But all that friendship, all that care can do,— Why should I say it?—He is not a villain; And if he have deceived, 'twas not in guile— I'll answer for his heart. Nay, weep not; he Would know in what your sorrow can be served. Vouchsafe some answer, madam. EULALIA. I have none To give—I am ashamed to weep—and tears Are all the speech I have. GIOVANNI. Then let them fall; Interpret but their meaning; and that wish Shall be omnipotent with poor Ignatio. EULALIA. No; I'll not weep!—You are the Prince's friend; Perhaps you may be mine; but that I know not:— No matter; I am past the hurt or help Of friends. This say to Prince Ignatio; And this I say to you—, I am aware That there are acts must bear the pains of guilt, And, what is worse, the shame, which yet are guiltless, At least I would fain hope it, so please Heaven In mercy to permit; for innocence Is all the stay that's left me—I will bear them Patiently. Sir, my heart shall break in silence, If't please the Prince to send me from this place. No pride for me—so I will tell the truth— I cannot move a hand, or lift an eye, But something either whispers what I am, Or what I have been. GIOVANNI. It shall be done, lady. Nay, at this hour is a retreat prepared, But that, methought, yourself had been averse, And wish'd to tarry here some space. EULALIA. Oh! sir, Pardon me—grief is still fantastical, And drags the coward heart a thousand ways. I wish to quit this place; at least, I think I wish it. GIOVANNI. Madam, even for that thought It shall be done. Is there aught else? EULALIA. No, Signor, Nought else; and yet there is—Oh! poor, mean heart, How must I bribe thee to be resolute? I cannot speak the word, and yet I must. GIOVANNI. What is't disturbs you, madam? Is there aught Further that you would speak? EULALIA. Oh! no, no, no; Let me go hence, and leave me till that time. GIOVANNI. Nay, madam; but there is. Nor dare I leave you, Nor can I—pardon me—until I know it! EULALIA. But who will pardon me when they shall know? No matter; more a wretch I cannot be. Sir, I—I would—I trust it is no harm, And to indulge me were but charity, To one that's fall'n so low. Hear my request, Yet do not answer to it yea or no; But tell Ignatio—Say that she who loved him, And loves him still,—but in that kind she ought,— Would see him fain once more; but only once, Or ere she goes for ever. Do not answer, But tell Ignatio this; and if he frown, Or shrink, or seem to inly hesitate, Breathe no word further. I can turn my face, And die in darkness, and most silently; For I have learn'd the woman's hardest lesson, To be forsaken, and yet not complain!— I pray you pardon me. [Exit Eulalia. GIOVANNI. Your bidding shall Be done, sweet lady.—Thus we vainly pour A little comfort on a raging grief, To make it rage the more; even as the water Doth an o'er-mastering fire. My task is over. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Interior of the Ducal Palace. Enter Frankendall, alone. I've pull'd a business on my head, of which My mind misgives me. Is it honourable To play the eaves-dropper thus—and bait my nets To catch stray scandals,—to rake even for truth 'Mid the court spy's base refuse? Did I doubt As to the merits of mine occupation, I need do so no longer. When a man Devises mischief, 'tis the devil's device To send fit instruments; and in the nick, Here comes a vain, pert, waiting, court coquette, As voluble as is her mistress' parrot— As worthless, as unprincipled, as mischievous, And scarce more secret. I have seen, of late, She and that slippery smooth-tongued Jack o' the Duke's Have some intelligence. Whether she cheat him, Or he cheat her, 'tis equal; for I have The key to both. She's here. I'll strain my humour To keep the golden mean 'twixt jest and earnest. Her female instinct, doubtless, hath inform'd her That weightiest points are oftest hinted so. Now for my cue. Enter Fiametta. Ah! is it you, Signora? How does your beauty for this many a day?— I've had a cruel interval to pine. FIAMETTA. Are you dull, Signor? FRANKENDALL. How should I be other, Not seeing thee, Fiametta? FIAMETTA. Why, 'tis pity— When thou didst see me, thou wast dull enough. FRANKENDALL. Marry, a worn-out suitor of the court, Whose pains have brought him, as it oft falls out, Fair words and disappointment, hath enough To fill his brain with cobwebs. But for thee, Why, thou hast kept my case so long in hand, That time decides it for thee. Well, what help? He who hath lived through twenty years of courtship, May e'en survive the end on't—ay or no. FIAMETTA. If I had listen'd twenty years to thee, Sweet captain, I might boast a well spent life. Why, thou unblushing libertine—how long is't Since thou first knew'st my name? FRANKENDALL. Nay, pardon me, Sweet Fiametta; think'st thou I could mean That thou wast young—some twenty years ago? No, no; thou but fill'st up the odd three years, The last and brightest. I was hurt before; Now I am slain; and therefore am I dull. FIAMETTA. Thou art an insolent. FRANKENDALL. True, I am old. There's Signor Sanzio, the Duke's silken officer, Who speaks beneath his breath, and ever sits Mum—with his hands across—demurely—thus; He's good ten years my junior, at the least; And none of those same roysterers—whom thou hatest. FIAMETTA. Sanzio, forsooth,—you shall not be my broker, Depend upon't. FRANKENDALL. Nay, he hath all the secrets; A marvellous commendation here at court; And thou, as ladies sometimes do, may'st wed him Merely for curiosity. FIAMETTA. I must Be curious, indeed, ere I do that. FRANKENDALL. Why, get the secrets, then, without the man. And if thou'lt take me, I'll accept of thee And them for dower. I joke not—entre nous— They were worth gold; and that more ways than one. Nay, never look at me, for this is truth.— But I stand trifling here. Sweet Fiametta, When shall I see thee next? FIAMETTA. Whene'er I have As much ill luck. Heaven grant it may be long! FRANKENDALL. Ah me! not long. I will go furbish up My best behaviours, which are safe laid by With my dad's wedding suit; ay, and I'll promise To make love to thee but when thou desirest. (Aside.)—Methinks I may say that safely enough. And now, what canst thou say? FIAMETTA. Why, get thee gone! Thou'lt ne'er be wiser. FRANKENDALL. Not till I am married. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. —The Interior of the Ducal Palace. Enter Ignatio. Would that Giavanni were return'd!—Oh guilt! What work thou makest here!—Methinks I feel Like one who walks beneath an avalanche, A whisper may bring down. How meanly sore Are breasts like mine! A Prince! by Heaven, my soul Lags on her journey, and doth droop the head, Despised and mournful, like a sorry jade, Gall'd to the quick with some unworthy burthen!— I am worn with apprehension; and a flood Of chill dismay rushes into my breast, E'en if a mouse stir—yea, a portal's jar Shocks to my inmost heart, that, like the aspen, Trembles with scarce a breath. This keen suspense Is past the bearing almost. Oh! how happy Could I not live in some despised nook; Ay, starve. For grant this minute did not know How to procure a morsel for the next, 'Twere but to be resolved—'twere but to die— To sink upon the bosom that was ours, O'ercome with no dishonourable sleep, And lull'd by all that makes the good man rest— The love of those we love, and innocence— No more of these for me!—O power accursed, And splendour! Would that I had never known ye! Why do I think?—I am lost!—Were it not better To drown a worthless life in floods of madness, If hot intemperance gave a short relief, And end it so; rather than thus crawl on In torture and dishonour?—I am desperate— Reckless. Who is there?—Ah, yes—it is Giovanni. Enter Giovanni. Welcome, my friend. Say, hast thou seen— GIOVANNI. My lord? There are no listeners? IGNATIO. Listeners! no; how should there? GIOVANNI. Nay, I know not, my lord. IGNATIO. There are no listeners. Now tell me, hast thou seen her? Speak! GIOVANNI. I have; And did deliver what your highness charged me. IGNATIO. Thou did'st?—How look'd she?—Hast thou not been long? GIOVANNI. Not longer, my dear lord, than prudence warn'd. As for her looks—what should I say?—Poor lady, Her state is easier to conceive than paint; For I must speak the truth—she look'd, my lord, As well might be expected—comfortless. IGNATIO. Oh, tortures!—Oh, Giovanni!—This from thee? GIOVANNI. My noble lord, I never have deceived you, And never shall. I am, in truth, your friend; So please your highness let me. IGNATIO. I know't, I know't; Go on. GIOVANNI. I said that she look'd comfortless, And so she did; and yet, 'midst all her grief, She did preserve, my lord, a gentle patience, And bore her ills with so resign'd a soul, In sooth I joy'd to see it; and to hear it, Methinks, should comfort you. IGNATIO. Comfort!—It does, My friend; it does indeed. GIOVANNI. She hath requested To be sent hence o' the sudden; and I promised It should be so. IGNATIO. Right—you did well. O' the sudden? Doubtless 'tis for the best. O God! that I Should ever live to say so! Bear with me; I cannot but feel, Giovanni. Did she not— Did she not mention—me?—Why dost thou pause? Speak out; I can bear all. GIOVANNI. She did, my lord. IGNATIO. How?—Why?—What did she say? GIOVANNI. She hath forgiven you— E'en from her inmost soul, I well believe— What cannot woman's dotage find excuse for? Nay, pardon me, my lord; I meant no sting. And with a trembling, tearful hesitation, She made me briefly the ambassador Of one request. IGNATIO. Request!—It shall be done. But what (oh, God!) could she request of me? This meekness is more cutting to my soul Than were her sharpest anger. GIOVANNI. Be composed; You tremble, my dear lord. She did request To see you ere she went. My lord, I do Conjure you, be composed. IGNATIO. The sound has struck A blow upon my heart. I'll go, though shame Crush me to th'earth ere I can cross her threshold; Or agony split my heart ere I can say, “What would'st thou?”—ere my tongue can coldly ask, “What begs Eulalia of Ignatio?” Oh!—Base! base! base! GIOVANNI. My noble lord, indeed This is not meet. IGNATIO. What is not meet, Giovanni? I'll go; and yet—What would'st thou say, my friend? GIOVANNI. I say, my lord, that you must do your pleasure. IGNATIO. So cold, Giovanni? Say, what would'st thou counsel? Is all thy warmth of friendship come to this, It must be stirr'd so oft? GIOVANNI. Mistake me not, Sweet Prince; nor wrong me. Mine shall bear a blast, Ay, burn the better for't, which would puff out Those flickering and inconstant Will o' the Wisps, Call'd “Princes' friends,” sprung from the mud o' the court, As these are from some fen. But what of that? This point, my lord, 'tis fit you should decide. One thing consider'd first; you must well know There's many a brow here, in your father's court, Whose smiles but wreathe its hate, e'en as the flower May hold a poison. This same peaceful junction Of states which seem'd to live for rivalship, This clear and peaceful current of events, Is not for those who fish in troubled waters; And here, God wot, there are too many such! At least 'tis whisper'd so. To such, 'twere sport To turn the torch of Hymen to a brand. We must beware of them. IGNATIO. They cannot make me More wretched than I am. So far, I am proof. But thou'rt a cynic, boding ill, Giovanni. Think'st thou such natures common? GIOVANNI. Common? ay. How should we see so many treasonous wonders; Vows white as snow turn'd black; oaths deep as midnight, Weighty as gold, yea, and more precious, held As lightly as the common liar's trash? Deep-hearted trusts, which should be like the rock, Dispersed in vapour like the fog-built coasts That mock the peopled top-mast?—Could this be Were they not common?—Honesty's a gem— Is't not so call'd?—Not less because 'tis rare. Trust not mankind, my lord. IGNATIO. I have done with trusting, Who cannot trust myself. Oh! would that never There had been need! Oh! would that I had been Born but the heir of some unheeded cot, Whose little smoke could scarcely top the trees That shelter'd it!—Would that I had, for now I'm heart-sick—O, Giovanni! sick at heart, E'en to the core. No matter; I perceive E'en thou despisest me. Well, I will see her; I will not have her think that she's despised. Wilt thou attend me? GIOVANNI. Were the risk, my lord, Ten times as great as 'tis, methinks your highness Need not have ask'd me that. IGNATIO. I did not need; For surely thou art true—so pardon me. This night, thou know'st, there is another banquet; We'll steal away i' the midst; 'twill not be noted; For that I ne'er was given to revellings, And still was delicate. Be thou provided; Thou understand'st me; and let Sanzio Look to the horses. GIOVANNI. Fear me not, my lord. IGNATIO. Forget not change of garb and masks. Now leave me. Say not one word to sap my resolution; And so comport thee at the feast to-night, As best may blind suspicion. Fare thee well! Yet one word more—Dost thou doubt Sanzio? I think thou can'st not; for thou know'st that he Was not court-bred; but from the fields, like thee. GIOVANNI. Poor stay for innocence! Yea, 'tis marvellous, How hearts of softest stuff, transported hither, Straight harden, and grow stoney, like the coral Pluck'd from its native waters. IGNATIO. Giovanni, There is no end of this! Unjust suspicion Creates what it would shun. GIOVANNI. Nay, I am silent. My lord, your servant ever. [Exit. IGNATIO. No; my friend; And much I need thee. For till time hath taught— If, (as they say,) 'twill teach forgetfulness, And the soul alter strangely, like the sky Which still the gazer sees is not the same As 'twas before; and yet he sees it change not:— Until this be—if e'er it can, to me,— Had I no breast where to repose my griefs, Methinks I could not live, but blind oblivion Or madness must enwrap me. Poor Eulalia! Who shall share thine? Will thy unsullied soul Not waste itself away, e'en like the diamond That knows no baser mixture, with a fire Pure as itself? These thoughts are torture. Oh! Teach me thy lesson, kind forgetfulness; Though 'tis a hard one. Being what I am, Tell me not, memory, of what I was, Or what I might have been. These musings poison My very rest. In days of happier hours I well remember once of having dream'd That I was born again, some shepherd's son, In Tempe, or the islands of the blest, Or 'neath some commonwealth by Plato built, Living 'mid pleasant groves and sunny fields, In pastoral innocent bliss. That dream last night Came to my pillow; and besides itself, Shew'd me, methought, the forms of smiling hours, When it first hover'd o'er me. Oh, what pain It was to wake to cursed remembrance; and To feel hot—scalding tears start in mine eyes; And shrink in guilt from her that rested by me; And pray that I might sleep once more—my last— Nor dream, nor wake, again. I'm press'd to the earth. Perchance the balmy air may yield some medicine— I'll seek it. [Exit. SCENE III. —The Interior of the Ducal Palace. Enter Leonora, the Duke, Count Beltran, Sanzio, and Fiametta. DUKE. Well, Count, since duty is so obstinate, And presses you away, I leave you to A better oracle. Let her towards whom That duty flows, e'en moderate its current. The Princess must decide it. BELTRAN. Sir, your highness, In every thing too good, shall pardon me; For that I have a duty paramount To what I owe even to your condescension. My noble and all-gracious mistress may, And can dispose of me, even with a breath, As best may suit her will and dignity. DUKE. Why, then, most dutiful Lord Conservator, You, and the Princess, and my boy Ignatio, Shall argue it; but two to one, Lord Viceroy— Your province has a longer carnival— You'll go not hence these ten days. Save you, sir. [Exit Duke. BELTRAN. Your highness's servant.— (Aside.) She looks haughtily. No matter.—May it please your highness, madam, To ratify now my departure hence? LEONORA. Methinks you're anxious, sir, to leave us; and If so, we give good-morrow either way To guests who come or go. BELTRAN. Pardon me, madam, If my anxiety to discharge that trust With which the Prince, your husband, and yourself, Have honour'd me, shall make me seem too careless Of aught besides that trust. I do beseech you, Misconstrue me no further. In all things, Without exception or reserve, I wait Your highness' pleasure; and my zeal, if hasty, Is tractable. I kiss your highness' hand, Either to go or stay; so please you, madam. LEONORA. Why, stay, then, sir. I'll wager half your province Against a ducat, it shall suffer nothing, Though you, its ruler, shall be festive here Some moons to come. Make yourself easy, Count; Though, from your cloudy brow and backward tongue, That be perhaps no easy task. To-night We'll have you look more like a reveller. BELTRAN. (Aside.) Perchance I may; and more than you expect. —It shall go hard but I obey you, madam; And if, henceforth, I feel anxiety, (For there are times on which we cannot choose,) It is but that such happiness may last. LEONORA. You're wondrous thoughtful, Count; this boding care Is sudden in its growth, methinks. BELTRAN. True, madam, It may, perhaps; but say it be, what then? Say I've had proof, almost within the hour, How few are what they seem; how many should be; That not a sun that shines but smiles on falsehood; That not a darkling nook but holds a traitor; How wayward is the course of human fates, E'en to the greatest; on what false foundations, What treach'rous sand, what hollow buttresses, The happiness e'en of princes is constructed,— 'Tis not less true for that. LEONORA. This moralizing I understand not; nor, to say the truth, Shall take much pains to try—'tis oddly timed. If you're ambitious to turn preacher, Count, Pray keep your sermon for the Mask to-night; It must be useful one way or the other; If not ta'en seriously, 'twill sure be laugh'd at; So on both sides there's gain. BELTRAN. You are merry, madam; Long may your highness be so! LEONORA. Thank you, Count; The longer that you'll doff that ominous face, And look like other people and yourself. BELTRAN. May others ne'er have cause to look like me. I cry your highness mercy—I am merry, Since you will have it so. LEONORA. Why, you do best, And take my thanks; 'tis recompence enough, Is it not, Count, for being as you should, Without such bribery? Nay, bethink you, coz— A soldier and a gallant look so grave! Methought you'd surely seen a ghost last night, And durst not keep your lodging. Now, believe me, I'd almost ask'd you if your hair was grey; Men planet-struck, they say, will oft be so. Come, we must have none mope when we are smiling.— Fiametta, know you where my lord is gone? FIAMETTA. To the terrace by the river's side, your highness, With the Signor Giovanni, as I think. LEONORA. We'll join them there. BELTRAN. I shall attend your highness. [Exeunt Leonora, Beltran, and Fiametta. Sanzio comes forward. Ay, that way shines the sun of fortune now! What would I give yond gallant were my patron? For I grow cold in zeal, even as my service Itself grows cold. I have done and known too much; And how are such reguerdon'd? Are they not Turn'd out o' the way politely—made to stuff Some dirty crevice, call'd a distant Post, Lest they should prate or crave; or else kick'd down, As most men do the ladders which they climb by?— I am a tool, whose use is past; nor would The artist have me seen. I can mark well That the grave Don, Giovanni, likes me not; I note the deep suspicion of his eye, Although his tongue keeps tune. If he have done With me, I've done with him. He is fool, Who, cogg'd by the smooth word called gratitude, Which all men have i' their mouth, and few elsewhere, Starts when convenience whispers in his ear To put off his old master for a new. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Interior of the Ducal Palace. Beltran, alone. By this time, as I think, did Frankendall Look to return. Methought the princely chicken, The double-delicate Ignatio, Look'd droopingly the while; yea, and his donship, The favourite owl, Giovanni, through his gravity Betray'd an anxious watchfulness. There's something Yet to be known. Would Frankendall were come! If that same smooth-brow'd Sanzio be the casket That locks their secret, Florence to a zechin We find the spring.—Within there! Enter Pablo. PABLO. Save your highness. BELTRAN. Is Frankendall come back? PABLO. Not yet, my lord. BELTRAN. When he returns, he'll find me here; and you, Pablo, take care we are not interrupted; Our conference is of weight. You mark me, sir? I'll have no listeners nor interlopers; So look to it. PABLO. I shall, my lord. [Exit Pablo. BELTRAN. 'Tis well. Commend me to that dish of curds and cream— That slippery Sanzio! If they've trusted him, The promise of some office where the gains Something outweigh the pains, and he is ours, Or else I cannot spell. There is one man He loves above all men; and that man is Even honest Master Sanzio. Ay, self, self, The moral atheist, that sees nothing in The universe but self! Nor honesty, No, nor e'en fear, shall be of power to quiet That wicked itching of the palm for gold.— I have known the time I should have somewhat stammer'd Ere I had ta'en this course. Did not ambition Absorb all other feelings, as the sunbeams Eat out the weaker fires, I'd stumbled at it.— Enter Frankendall. Welcome. Thou look'st as if thou hadst brought news. FRANKENDALL sings. “He set up his oaths like skittles, His vow like a wickett in sight; But the devil he took up the game, And bowl'd them down with a doit.” BELTRAN. Sleek Signor Sanzio then's a sieve; is't so? FRANKENDALL. Ay, and why not, my lord? Think you, he's honest, Because he smooths his foretop o'er his forehead, And drops his eye-lids when he meets his patron, And smirks whene'er he speaks to a great man, And lisps and minces all his words out edge-ways? Your tufted jay is not the only rogue; Others can rob an orchard. BELTRAN. Nay, not I; I guess'd but even now what thou would'st tell me. But come; particulars, particulars! What hast thou learn'd? FRANKENDALL. A world of news, my lord. Shall I begin at the north pole or the south? BELTRAN. Even where thou wilt, so thou forgettest none. Thou'lt be as long in telling of this world, As I should be in circumnavigating't. FRANKENDALL. Then, in one breath, I have unearth'd a marriage. BELTRAN. A marriage!—Well, what mare's nest hast thou found? Who's married? FRANKENDALL. Who!—The Prince Ignatio. BELTRAN. That news is something stale. What dost thou mean? FRANKENDALL. I mean, my lord, that he's been knit these three years; Ay, more; 'twas ere his brother Cosmo sicken'd. You stare. Depend on't, you shall find it so; A marriage—both in truth and courtesy; A left hand love-knot, call'd in Germany; One of those matches which Heaven ratifies, But which the devil can break—I mean the lawyer: 'Tis good in every thing, save statute law, And that's but ticklish neither. BELTRAN. What a whirl Of circumstance and supposition's this! Cannot thy story travel on its road Without upraising such a cloud of comment? Thou pour'st it like fresh Champagne from the bottle, Liquor and froth at once, and most o' the last. FRANKENDALL. Nay, nay; your highness e'en must let me tell My story my own way; or we shall botch it. BELTRAN. Do so, in God's name! only stick to facts; And if I breathe one word of interruption, Cut short my curiosity in the midst, Or starve it for a twelvemonth. FRANKENDALL. Done, my lord; A bargain. Does your highness hap to know Where stands the Prince's villa, an hour's journey Above the city, where the river idles And spreads itself round many a tufted island, And the commingling boughs and wanton blossoms Stoop to the lucid pools to kiss themselves, Like children o'er a mirror, or young maids O' the bridal morn, who laugh at their own blushes? BELTRAN. I guess the spot thou talk'st of, but knew not That Prince Ignatio had a villa there. FRANKENDALL. In name. It seems it is a perquisite Of that grave sage, the favourite Giovanni; 'Tis a sweet scene; whether at languid noon, When the still current, 'mid the varied islets, Seems chased with fairy gold; or at still midnight, When the bright moon besilvers the glass'd waters, And in them views herself with more delight Than e'er she did in her Endymion's eyes Upon hush'd Latmos' peak. BELTRAN. Now, plague be on thee, Dost think that thou art prating to some limner? What's all this stuff to me? FRANKENDALL. Pause you, my lord— Just where the villa fronts the spreading stream, Midway, upon an isle, there stands a temple, Minerva's called. Thither the Prince Ignatio Will oft-times oar himself, in a light skiff, For studious purpose. BELTRAN. Well? FRANKENDALL. Marry, my lord, For one who hath respect for the wise goddess, He puts her sanctity to a curious office. BELTRAN. What office, Frankendall? FRANKENDALL. A go-between's. She only helps him to an earthly goddess, Less cold, God wot, and prudent than herself. There is a cottage on the further brink, Bosom'd in wood, to which an arched walk Leads only; there his highness makes a trip, Sometimes by moonlight too, as worthies use Who dabble in the contraband—You take me? BELTRAN. Now, blessings on thee, thou hast come at last To the point indeed; but is this veritable? The marriage matter—art thou sure of that? Or if thou art, is't valid? FRANKENDALL. Why, that point The gownsmen must decide. They married, certain, To all intents; but then the old politic Duke Has long enacted that his blood shall wed not Without his high consent—all's moonshine else— And like enough the Pope may back him out; He knows the trick to manage the church, well. BELTRAN. No matter, it will do as 'tis; (aside) or else I'm wide o' the mark. Let her but know of this, (And she shall know it,) and her soft-voiced mate May shroud himself i'th'case of some base viol— She'll play the true Italian. I will set About it instantly, and find some way. (Aloud.) Hark, Frankendall—(Aside)—no puttings off for me; I, who have had small fair play with the world, Will make myself amends. They are but fools Who pick, and cull, and boggle at events; He who would reap, and gather a full garner, Must take both tares and wheat.—(Aloud.) What would'st thou say? (Aside.) Ay, sheave them when the sun shines. (Aloud.) Well, what wouldst thou? FRANKENDALL. Your highness' pleasure—You did speak, my lord. BELTRAN. True, so I did. Didst thou inquire aught further? FRANKENDALL. I did, my lord; and have discover'd that Which is point-blank to the business—he intends To visit her this night. BELTRAN. Thou art the herald That point'st the way to fortune; it is seal'd, No moment shall be lost. I've thought upon it. Is thine informant—what's his name?—ay, Sanzio— Is honest Sanzio here at hand? FRANKENDALL. He is Within five minutes' message. BELTRAN. Call him, then; But set me ink and paper first. Stay, Frankendall; Art sure this traitor has not a false bottom On both sides, as your juggler's caskets have? FRANKENDALL. Not in this case, my lord. [Exit Frankendall. BELTRAN. Go, bring him, then.— Now for a scrawl of some mysterious sort, Dimly to shadow mischief. Hints, dark hints, Like mirky nooks, are still most dangerous. I have it. [He writes. “Most honour'd lady, This from one who loves you. You think yourself the Prince Ignatio's wife; So thinks the world, or some of it at least; Be sure of it. She that can best resolve you, Must be sought westward, by the Arno's side. The Prince, your husband, shall to-day be ill (At ease)—to-night still worse. Let this betoken I am no lying Sibyl—so beware, Or else your realm and you may chance repent— One that loves truth, and honours Leonora.”— Is not this barb'd? They are return'd already. Enter Frankendall and Sanzio. Your servant, sir. Hark hither, Frankendall. (Aside to Frankendall.) O'erlook this scrawl; 'tis mystical enough! FRANKENDALL. It is indeed. BELTRAN. In character and meaning? FRANKENDALL. Both; both. BELTRAN. Why, then, to get it safe convey'd. —Sir, my attendant has already told me How much I am bound to you. I shall not pause To trust you further. Nay, no ceremony— I know your services, and shall requite them. I would convey this paper to the Princess— Justice and strong allegiance both demand it— Yet not be seen in it—you understand me? Can you encompass this? SANZIO. I can, my lord; So please your highness trust me; on the instant. Each day a throng of supplicants attend To see the Princess pass, that they may tender Some small petitions, as the custom is; I'll find a trusty agent, who shall wait 'Midst this obtrusive crowd, and pass this paper E'en to her highness' hand. Let it be superscribed, As packets are that bring intelligence Of moment and of weight; and our conveyancer, Th'important missile once deliver'd, shall Not wait for questioning. BELTRAN. 'Tis very well; But can you do this now? SANZIO. E'en now, my lord. BELTRAN. Take it, and do it, then; and make thy fortune, For it is writ in this. Go; lose no time. [Exit Sanzio. Now, Frankendall, whence comes this gravity? Sits not this action easy on thy stomach? Art thou turn'd scrupulous? FRANKENDALL. Not I, my lord; 'Tis not for me to turn a caviller, Who ne'er could understand a subtlety. I ever was a scurvy politician, And ever shall. I love or hate a man; And even tell him so; and there's an end Of all my worldly lore. BELTRAN. I tell thee what, There's no end of this moral squeamishness. He that will fight the battle of the world— And some must fight it—let him use the means That are adopted by his adversaries. He who will never taste of a repast Till every bit be sauced unto his mind, May famish for a fool. Who seeks for gold Must take the dross—Who snatches at a rose Must grasp it, thorns an' all. 'Twas ever thus; Which of the worthies that have won dominion, But leapt and waded for't. No more of this; I did not think thou hadst been such a prude. Where is the Paradise which holds this Eve Who tempts Ignatio to forbidden fruit? FRANKENDALL. Above the city, where the orchards thicken Into a wilder but still smiling forest, Fast by the Arno's side. BELTRAN. Now, by my stars, It was about that spot I met the eyes That so enchanted me. If it were she, There needed but this last provocative To set the keen edge on my resolution. Fate thrusts him in my way, turn where I will; And he or I must down. Well, dignity Steps with redoubled triumph, if revenge Hold up her train. Follow me, Frankendall; I'll to the Princess, and blow up the fuel That Sanzio has put fire to. [Exit Beltran. FRANKENDALL. In a thought I follow you, my lord. I can see well, That, spite of all his specious arguments, This action sits not easy on his spirit; It will be always thus. Craving ambition, Grasping, impatient like a passionate child, Takes good and ill at once. He is a boy, Who, in his haste to plant the treach'rous twigs He has limed for some poor bird, daubs his own fingers. Honour! they talk of thee; but thou wilt wink Until ambition does his dirty work, And after, hold the ewer to wash his hands! I'll go no further here than my sworn duty Compels me to. It is a road I like not. [Exit Frankendall. SCENE II. —The Interior of the Duke's Palace. Enter Leonora and Fiametta. LEONORA. If the Count Beltran shall attend upon me, You may admit him. To none else, just now, Can I give audience. Leave me; I would be Some little space alone. [Exit Fiametta. (Unfolding a paper.) It is the pest of birth still to be subject To insolent scrawls like these, born of the plots And machinations of the coarse attendance That throngs the heels of greatness. Base-born wretches! Now could I be indignant with myself, To think that such a petty thing as this Should ruffle me one moment. But they say The smallest pebble, cast into the ocean, Must alter its great surface. Nor can I Forget, perforce, what I yet scorn to think: And yet 'tis strangely levell'd. I have noted The Prince oft struggles with a melancholy Which he will not give tongue to; but his friend, The Signor Giovanni, did assure me Those clouds which sometimes pass across his mind, Like skyey shadows o'er the mountain's side, But prove its clearness, as the slightest breath Will dim the brightest mirror. Enter Beltran. Count, this visit, I trust, may be to you, as 'tis to me, A pleasure. BELTRAN. Gracious Princess, to behold Your happiness is still the sum of mine. LEONORA. My happiness?—What! is there such a word? Count, you have soon forgot your moral lessons. BELTRAN. And well I may; for who would not forget, Beholding one so fair who hath not learn'd them? And may experience long defer the instruction!— But Heaven forbid I have not preach'd too well; What I forget, can you remember, madam? LEONORA. If I did not, I should be put in mind! BELTRAN. Impossible. Has aught disturb'd your highness? Trust me, you look but pale; and pardon me For daring thus to see it. LEONORA. Oh! 'tis nothing, Or little; sooth, I have been just annoy'd— Teazed beyond patience with the low petitions, The courtesies and familiarity Of a vile throng, that ever haunt the heels Of those above them, who will stoop to them. I marvel that the Prince Ignatio Should bear such homely bondage. BELTRAN. Nay, your highness May blame too hastily; he may be counsell'd; Haply 'tis policy. LEONORA. If 'tis, I care not; I shall not buy such love at such a rate; And yet it may, for Signor Giovanni Told me the Prince, more than his warlike father With all his deeds, was met by popular praise. BELTRAN. No doubt! The Duke is fear'd as well as loved; The—what's his name? Oh!—Signor Giovanni, Whoe'er he be, might have remember'd that In his wise estimate, as, if I knew him, I should make bold to prompt him. LEONORA. If you knew him! Your memory, Count, is doubtless sore oppress'd With things of greater weight; but yet methinks The Prince's friend need not be titled twice. BELTRAN. Your highness' pardon. Memory sometimes, Like to a froward child, will cast away Just what it ought not; else I had remember'd The Signor Giovanni. Such a man, Who, underneath the cloak of gravity, Conceals so many virtues, gay ones too, When they get holiday! LEONORA. Come, sir, this trifling Is something ill-timed. Signor Giovanni Hath been the Prince Ignatio's long tried friend; And is his eldest. BELTRAN. I cry mercy, madam; Far be it from me, e'er to impeach his worth. No doubt—no doubt he is a trusty friend, And useful too; a meet, scholastic comrade, Of deep, and rare, and infinite endowment, For one of studious habit, like his highness. Surely I've heard—ay, now I think upon't— I have heard it said 'twas difficult to tell Who was the master of that pretty villa The Prince laid out for him, fast by the Arno; So constantly they shared it. It is sweet To see a mind, which power and luxury court, Thus bound to science, to deep contemplation, And learning's chasten'd pleasures. LEONORA. Count, I shall not; No, shall not condescend to think you dare To trifle with me when I have forbidden it; But yet your seriousness still speaks in riddles. What is this villa—this companionship, I mean—you talk so strangely of? BELTRAN. Nay, madam; Now were it possible that the Princess could, On any one occasion, condescend To trifle with her subject, I should deem That this were it—when she is pleased to ask Where stands a paradise, to which all Italy Can scarce produce a fellow! Plague upon't, An if my dull stupidity has not marr'd A pretty complot to surprise your highness. I'll wager my poor revenue to a doit, The Prince intended that this second Eden Should not be known, till seen by her who only Can be its worthy Queen.—Tongue, foolish tongue, I e'en must curb thee, if thou bring'st me still To these dilemmas! Madam, sure your highness Is something indisposed, for you grow pale. LEONORA. I am, indeed,—no; stir not. It is nothing— 'Tis nothing, sir—believe me. BELTRAN. Gracious madam, I cannot think it nothing, when one instant Can blanch the living roses of your cheek. LEONORA. A transient faintness—that was all. Retirement Shall be a ready cordial. BELTRAN. Then permit me— (Within there!)—let me hope it may—to be No further interruption; rest your highness. Enter Fiametta. LEONORA. I thank you, Count; anxiety's not needed— I shall be well anon. To-night we hope Your presence at the banquet. FIAMETTA. Please your highness Now to retire? LEONORA. I do; attend upon me. [Exeunt Leonora and Fiametta. BELTRAN. I've set the torch, and surely; for already The flame begins to mount. Fev'rous suspicion, On whose hot lids sleep sheds her dews in vain, Shall never let it slacken. This brief transport, Sudden and short, as suddenly subsiding, Is only the first signal of the fire That's kindled at the heart. 'Tis the precursor Of other and more vehement stirrings up, Until the untameable spirit shall o'erboil Into some violent course. I know her nature; 'Tis like mine own. Sit fast, Ignatio; And keep thy bride, or thou may'st lose thy dukedom. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —The Interior of the Ducal Palace. Beltran and Frankendall. Beltran (comes forward.) Now would'st thou hug me, Machiavel, beholding How like a reckless reveller I look, And cloak designs that yet may shake a state, Beneath such guise as this. I am a reveller! Shall I not laugh and quaff, as others do; And sit beneath the shadow of my hopes, Just budding into blossom? Shine on, Sun Of Fortune; and no votary of thine Shall more exult than I, to worship thee, Or make thee more a goddess! Frankendall, Is it not time to go? Methinks the guests Should, by the noise, be thronging to the palace. FRANKENDALL. My lord, the hubbub would declare as much. BELTRAN (walks to the window.) The windows are all light; unnumber'd feet Follow the flitting torches, as they gleam Perpetual through the marble courts; loud voices Of menials, haughtier than their haughty masters, Mix with the bursts of music that peal forth Whene'er a portal's oped; then both, anon, Are drown'd amid the clash of prancing hoofs, Indignant of the rein. Plume follows plume; And escort follows escort. 'Tis a scene Where many a heart beats high. But could they view The inmost breasts of all this splendid throng; The envies darker than the night; the discords Waving their torches in conflicting rage; The bitter griefs that yearn for solitude; The hopes struck down; the gnashings of despair; The treacheries; the jealousies; the fears; 'Twould make the rout that clamours here below Seem peaceful as the barefoot hermit's haunt, Compared with such a hell. You are come at last. Enter Pablo and Jacomo. Is it not time we enter'd to the palace? JACOMO. The throng is at the height, my lord. BELTRAN. 'Tis well; I shall attend you instantly.—Hark, Frankendall; One word before we go. (Aside to Frankendall.) I need not tell thee, Suspicion is let loose; and 'tis my cue To lead it where I would, but unobserved. Hark thee, I have laid a train. In this hot clime Of Italy, thou know'st they are well skill'd, (And crossing passions give them scope enough,) In all the changes of love's minstrelsy. Through the voluptuous wires of the guitar They'll breathe a gale, more amorous and warm Than those from whence th'immortal coursers sprung; Ay, or more wing'd with jealousy than those So fateful to th'Æolian shepherd swain, Who woo'd with languid sighs th'inconstant air. Now mark me, for there will be masks to-night; Observe, and thou shalt see a stripling lad, In the wild vestments of a Troubadour. He must be brought—as well may come to pass— To give some relish of his art. Eye well Ignatio, when he sings; and if thou see'st, Or any sign of dread, or of suspense, Or notest confusion struggle in his cheek, Cow'r in his eye, or falter on his tongue, I say, improve the time; let it not 'scape Devoid of observation, whence the most I wish it were observed. Forget not this, If thou would'st keep my favour and my love. Now follow me. I know thou likest it not; Nor do I say thou should'st. Had I but known Two moons ere this, half of what now I know, It had not been—no matter—What's to be, Shall be. I tell thee, who, as we must, drinks At troubled fountains, even perforce must take The water with the sand. FRANKENDALL. My lord, I know This is no time to argue; and my logic Was ever lame. For you I would do much, And this amongst the rest, come on't what will. BELTRAN. Fear not; I am resolved. (Aloud.) Come, gentlemen. PABLO. We wait your highness' pleasure. BELTRAN. Follow, then. Hark you; is't not begun? [A sound of Music PABLO. It is, my lord. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A Banquetting Hall. The Duke, Leonora, Ignatio, Giovanni, Beltran, Frankendall, Sanzio, Masks, Attentants, &amp;c. &amp;c. DUKE. Welcome all, gentlemen; welcome, cavaliers; Pray ye, be merry. God forgive me now! We old ones will have oversights sometimes; Age even will have his way. I should have greeted You first, ye fair ones, whose half-veil'd eyes Seem brighter for their shadows, as the stars Still sparkle keenest when the tawny night Puts on her duskiest mask. Be merry too; And we shall not be wanting.—Ah, gallants! With all your glitter and your plumery, Be sure ye have not left your hearts at home, Or, what were worse, your wit. I warrant now There are some here can bring a prude to smile, Or whisper love into a soft one's ear. There's sure a sonnetteer amongst us, gentlemen; If so, we'll have a serenade.—What! none To volunteer, amongst the Troubadours, And tell a tale in echo to his lute, Address'd to many, yet but meant for one? Is it not so? Well, well. My lord, Count Beltran, Your arm; you shall with me amongst these beauties; 'Tis hard, now, if we cannot find some planet That will adopt us as her satellites. BELTRAN. Amongst the Pleiades, the hardest is To choose the brightest; but we'll e'en essay The task, since 'tis your highness' pleasure. IGNATIO. (Aside to Giovanni.) How Likest thou Count Beltran's favour, Giovanni? He is a most accomplish'd gentleman; With what an air he strides amid the throng! Mark, all instinctively give way, yet all Press round him. Still, I know not how it is, But there is something in his very smile I cannot love. What think'st thou? GIOVANNI. This, my lord: His smoothest looks are like the clearest ice, Which but betrays the soonest. IGNATIO. Fie, Giovanni! Thou speakest bitterly. GIOVANNI. Plainly—pardon me— I love him not; and that's the simple truth: Nor will I trust that lowering brow of his, However smiling. Why, a child may see, In spite of all his put on suavity, The world within is, even now, at war With that without. IGNATIO. My friend, thou'rt prejudiced. If there be darker shadows in his face, Thou know'st Count Beltran hath had many griefs. GIOVANNI. No more, perchance, than others may through him. The ambitious man, believe't, is still a savage; Adore him, if you will; coax him; admire him; But trust him not. IGNATIO. Why, this is very harshness; The world allows Count Beltran many virtues. GIOVANNI. Virtues, my lord, when wedded to ambition, (For I deny not he hath many virtues,) Are but as jewels, cast into the deep, Which only lose themselves—not profiting that On which they are bestow'd. [Shout without. IGNATIO. What noise is that? GIOVANNI. The people's joy, dear Prince; their sympathy With yours; not less sincere because perhaps 'Tis somewhat rudely shewn. [Shouts again. LEONORA. Signor Giovanni! IGNATIO. Leonora speaks. GIOVANNI. Madam, your highness' pleasure. LEONORA. What means this rude and most obtrusive clamour, Which even the palace stays not? GIOVANNI. Madam, 'tis The overflowing transport of the people To see yourself and Prince Ignatio happy. LEONORA. Take order that it trouble us no more. Was there no place fit for these vile carousals And vulgar greetings, but the Ducal Palace? IGNATIO. Nay, Leonora, bear with them for once. Does it not pride you thus to see your festival Graced by a people's love? LEONORA. My lord, your tutors Perchance have taught you to esteem such things; Mine have not; and I value them alike, Whether they come or come not. I, at least, Who scorn the merchandize, need not pay the price Go, some of you, and quell this turbulence. GIOVANNI. Madam, it shall be done. 'Tis but for you To be obey'd and gracious. To the Prince, Your noble consort, there are superadded Duties to dignity—a high repayment Of happiness to those who joy in his.— Sanzio, take measures that the people quit The square before the palace. [Exeunt Giovanni and Sanzio. BELTRAN. (Aside.) Frankendall, Heard'st thou that plumed plebeian's insolence? Mark'd ye the ostrich? Think ye he'd digest Cold iron? JACOMO. Shall we try, my lord? BELTRAN. Not now; We'll maybe find a time. DUKE. Daughter, you're right; The boy Ignatio has been still too easy; He'll mend on't, when he knows them as I do. [Shouts. FRANKENDALL. (Aside to a Mask.) Fair lady, if this din would give me leave, I'd haply whisper love. FEMALE MASK. Now you are out; 'Tis plain you reck not what love is, or else You'd know his plainest language is the eyes. FRANKENDALL. By Jove! quick, madam, I am caught for once. Well, I shall learn it fast enough of you. But then we must not ogle through a mask! FEMALE MASK. Nay, hold. What if my features should unteach All that mine eye hath taught you? FRANKENDALL. Never fear; The eyes against the field for twenty ducats! FEMALE MASK. I see you are a gamester, even in love. FRANKENDALL. If I play fairly, where is the objection? 'Tis but a phrase—a foreign compliment— Let that content you. If you'd question me— In faith, I learn'd it of an English lord, Who loved a horse course better than his mistress— It serves to vary the French politesse. FEMALE MASK. A sweet variety! FRANKENDALL. Better than none. One hates the jargon of “amour” and “cour.” Ha! Master Troubadour, you're a-propos; Sing me, for Heaven's sake, some mellifluous rhyme, Can soften a hard heart. BELTRAN. If it be thine, That transformation were miraculous; I'd sooner look for lead to turn to gold. MASK. Love, Signors, seldom is as he appears; And, when he seems the blindest, sees the best: Yet fear not, lords—I am no satirist; My simple ditty, if it please not, harms not. Re-enter Giovanni. FRANKENDALL. (Aside.) Go nearer to the Princess when you sing. IGNATIO. (Aside to Giovanni.) What is the night? Is it not nigh the hour? GIOVANNI. Be calm, my lord; we are watch'd; start not; observed Was what I would have said. The night is moody, And the wind frets and moans in fitful gusts; Hurrying the wrack, as to some rendezvous Of storm, like squadrons ere the battle join. 'Twill be a dark night somewhere. All the better; So that its rage stoop not directly here— Sanzio is ready. (Aloud.) What! is this a song? Of mirth or mourning, gentle Troubadour? Methinks you tune it passing cunningly. MASK. Even as the hearer relish it, good Signor— Pray Heaven you do not think it out of tune? BELTRAN. Stand further there; you intercept the Duke. MASK, (sings.) CANZONET. “Say not he loves the rose the best, Because it twines his forehead fair, In seeming smiles and pleasure drest, 'Mid lighted halls and festal glare; His bosom hides his true love's hair; He dares not shew it in his crest; Oh! say not, then, because 'tis there, That he must love the rose the best. “Ah! no; he loves the lily best, Far, in the shade, from jealous eyes; He sees with joy the crimson west, When bliss is born and daylight dies; For to the conscious grove he hies, That long his flow'ret hath possess'd And softly there, in secret sighs— Ah! yes; he loves the lily best.” BELTRAN. For all your smooth preluding, Signor Minstrel, This lay, with all its honey, bears a sting. Good God, now, but your highness' hue is changed! IGNATIO. A faintness from the heat—I must retire Some little space; 'twill by and by begone. GIOVANNI. I shall attend your highness.—(Aside.) Sir, be calm; Let not a casual, mere coincidence Unnerve your manhood thus. IGNATIO. I am better. Gentlemen, Take no heed of me. In a little space I'll mix with you again.—I thank you, Signor, Your lute shall be in tune when I return, I hope.—Nay, gentle friends, no ceremony. [Exeunt Ignatio and Giovanni. BELTRAN. (Aside to Frankendall.) Do you mark that? Where is the Princess? FRANKENDALL. There; In conversation with the Duke. BELTRAN. 'Tis pity She mark'd not his departure. Dost thou think She did not? She shall be inform'd. FRANKENDALL. Stay, stay; Here comes his grave-faced pandarship again. BELTRAN. He is making towards the Princess. O, tis well! Let's hear the hypocrite's message. FRANKENDALL. I observed Her countenance change, just as the Prince retired; Methought the Duke did mark it. GIOVANNI. Madam, I Come as a messenger from his highness, who Hath even now retired some little space, From slight indisposition. LEONORA. Ha! retired? Indisposition?—On the instant shall I Attend on him. So tell him, sir. GIOVANNI. Your highness Shall pardon me. The Prince expressly begs Not to alarm your highness; 'tis a slight And not uncustomary discomposure; Nothing of serious note;—some little rest, Or some short breath of fresh air on the terrace, Shall send him back to you. In the meantime, He prays you to be cheerful, nor to suffer One moment's inconvenience to your guests. LEONORA. (Aside.) My woman's heart is swell'd almost to bursting. It is too true. Rouse yourself, Leonora; Nor stoop, nor pine one instant under wrong. (Aloud.) You need not fear, sir, lest my guests or I Be discomposed.—(Aside.) Yet stay, I still may wrong him; Perhaps 'tis better I should go myself. GIOVANNI. Let me beseech your highness, be composed. DUKE. Fie! Leonora; this is womanish: Fear not the boy; though he be delicate, He yet hath something of his father in him; He bends, but will not shiver. From a child Hath he been subject to these paroxysms.— Signor, go tell my boy Ignatio That we must see him here, or e'er the dance Shall be concluded—marry, late enough; Meanwhile, he'll take his evening draught of air On the Piazza, for the night is gusty: So tell him that the Princess says, with me— Shall he not, Principessa? LEONORA. Sir, 'tis fittest Your highness should command; so tell him, sir. [Exit Giovanni. DUKE. Now this is like the noble Leonora. Who would have thought that the high-minded Princess Would change her very colour and her tone, Even like some love-sick youngling of fifteen, Because her husband had a little qualm? Well, well, I say no more—I say no more— 'Tis haply as it should be, after all. Come, is't not time the ball was getting towards— Your hand—Nay, nay—no ceremony.—Gallants, Who shall refuse to follow my example? Is there a hand in all this room so cold To fright the gentle palm it would enclasp? Come, Signors; come, Signoras; we shall try If that your heels move glibly as your tongues. Go bid the music strike i'th'other hall.— Now for the lightest foot and lightest heart! [Exeunt. Beltran and Frankendall remain. BELTRAN. Hist!—Didst thou mark the Princess' brow, my friend? FRANKENDALL. I did; and never did I know her nature So stirr'd. The blood, that rose and vanish'd, clouded Her moveless features in such sort, I started; And when it had retired, methough it left Redoubled paleness on her marble brow. Not for ten thousand ducats would I be In some one's place! BELTRAN. No more; we are observed. I join the dancers. FRANKENDALL. And I fall asleep, Until the rattle of the dice-box rouse me, Or the loud cup. BELTRAN. Thou art incorrigible! [Exit Frankendall. I follow thee. There's something weighs upon me— I know not what. E'en now, when I had oped A casement, to drink in some breath of air, To cool my feverish blood, methought the wind Sigh'd heavily; and the dim and clouded arch Did shew so desolate, that when I had turn'd me To gaze upon the revelry within, I felt how comfortless ambition is; And almost thought it useless cruelty To let in darkness upon human hearts. That might have beat in blissful perfectness; Or tinge my soul with dark hypocrisy, For aught this world can give. 'Tis fantasy; If all be hollow, I am right at last; And selfishness may have a date as long As virtue. I will in, and leave those thoughts. Enter Sanzio hastily. Ha!—quick—speak—is it seal'd? SANZIO. It is. BELTRAN. Begone then! I'll think no more—for now it is too late. [Exit Sanzio. The voiceless night is pregnant with events; To-morrow e'en may babble of them. [Exit hastily. SCENE III. —Interior of a Villa on the Arno. Enter Eulalia and Ignatio. IGNATIO. 'Tis past—that pang is over; but, oh God! Another, worse if possible, succeeds. Eulalia, can I turn me from that eye, More sweetly light than is the rising morn, To follow shudd'ring after black-robed night, And stalk with her to hell? There's madness in't. Eulalia—shall we—shall we part, e'en thus? EULALIA. Compose yourself, my dear Ignatio; How thy frame trembles!—Oh! how wan thou look'st! IGNATIO. I do not tremble. Shall we part, Eulalia? EULALIA. Oh! do not—dare not ask. IGNATIO. I dare do aught: Speak but the word—give me a single look That says, “we will not;” and we part no more. EULALIA. What dost thou mean? IGNATIO. There is one way, Eulalia; Despair, e'en scorpion-like, is its own cure, When 'tis ring'd round with fire, as we are now. O! I could rest my head upon thy bosom, And think the mingling of our parting breaths More sweet than the first fearful kiss I gave thee, Because 'twould be the last; and so doubt-free. EULALIA. Die?—and thy boy—speak; would'st thou murder him? Thou may'st be mad; but be not savage too. IGNATIO. Oh! no, no, no! yes, I am mad. My brain Burns, and mine eyes shed not a single tear; Would I could weep like thee! But thou weep'st not! What pulls this coldness on thee? thou look'st pale; There's ice upon thy lips, and in thy touch; Yea, and thy brow, pure as the unsunn'd snow, Is now as chill. Whence is this change? Speak! Yonder, When thou did'st hang in agony o'er our boy, I saw him shrink as thy fast scalding tears Rain'd on his little face; and now thou stand'st Unshaken, nor a tear comes to thine eye. It is a horrid calmness. Speak, Eulalia, If thou would'st not destroy me! EULALIA. Thee!—destroy! Would I not die to blunt one single pang Of all that tear thee? Oh! Ignatio, I know not—since we parted from our boy, (See how the name calls up a tear again,) I either felt as if my heart had died, Or that 'twas left with him. That struggle o'er, I am resign'd—Sorrow were sinfulness. Must I not breathe in some forgotten nook, And, as I am forgotten—so, forget— All, but that innocent, if he lives to know, A helpless mother is his only help. Say to thyself, Ignatio, “She is dead;” And so I shall be, save unto the past. And when, perchance, thy name, in after time, Wafted on glory's breath, comes o'er mine ear, It shall but stir me as the melody Of his own land—left, never to return, Breathes on the exile's heart; and I shall weep, And waste the dew of unavailing tears Upon the wither'd flow'rs of former joy. Why dost thou gaze on me, with that sad look? Is not this duty? IGNATIO. What it is, I know not; But there's a fix'd and horrible calmness in't, More dread, because it hath the hue of health, Yet is not it. EULALIA. Whate'er it be, Ignatio, Yet, let us be submissive to the will Of Heaven. We've striven with fate too much already. I have oft heard, that ere the common doom Doth close the struggles of the labouring soul, Will a strange calmness ofttimes creep upon it, As though it were some foretaste of that rest, The weary laden hope. If it be that, Oh! I could die upon the hard, cold earth, As smilingly even as the infant sleeps, Unknowing what he leaves, or what he wakes to. God will protect him. IGNATIO. Whom? EULALIA. Our boy, Ignatio; He hath a father still; hath he not? IGNATIO. Cease!— These melancholy tones, killingly sweet, Go to my heart. I have an anguish here, That grows each moment more like mortal. Oh! Eulalia, thy still accents sound to me E'en as the o'erstretch'd string, which, ere it breaks, Vibrates the sweetest music. Hark! 'tis past: Our hour is past; 'tis midnight—dark indeed— The effort must be made—I cannot speak— But thou can'st think that which I dare not say. Oh! grasp my hand; and if thou hast a tear For me, then shed it now; for it must be The last; and say once more, or e'er we part, That thou forgivest me. EULALIA. Need I say so twice? Think'st thou I could be unforgiving now? Would love permit me in an hour like this? Let this, and this, convince thee. [Kisses his hand. IGNATIO. Humble not Thyself, Eulalia, for 'tis agony; Crush me not to the dust with self-reproach; If I did crawl to thee and kiss thy feet, It were more fit. EULALIA. No more—all's over now; Thou goest—we must be brief—one look, but one, Before thou leavest me—then pass at once, 'Tis the last, saddest, boon I ask of thee. Say not farewell to me, but let me bid thee Farewell. My woman's heart will have it so. Speak not again—unclasp my hand—and now (Oh, for one minute's strength, and then to die!) Farewell!—God keep!—God bless my dear Ignatio! [Exit Ignatio. He is gone for ever. One—one moment more, Return Ignatio. Lost Eulalia, what Madness is this! Where is my resolution? Oh! I must never hear that footstep more, No, nor that voice, of which a single accent Were as a drop of dew to the parch'd tongue Of a thirst-dying wretch. I am friendless now; A nameless wanderer; a cast-away On the wide waters. Enter Child. CHILD. Mother! EULALIA. Oh! no, no, Ingrate I am; is there not still a voice Speaks comfort; and upon this little breast Still I can drop sweet tears, and see his eyes Weep when he sees mine weep, he knows not why? Thou callest for thy father, my poor boy, And he will hear us. Thou shalt kneel with me, And lift thy little hands in aid of mine; And on thy supplicating innocence, Join'd to thy mother's tears, Heaven may look down Haply with peace and pardon. Come, my child! [They retire, and the Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —Interior of the Ducal Palace. Enter Giovanni I am fill'd with dark misgivings. Even now Methought the page I met avoided me; And that the knave to whom I gave our horses, Look'd strangely at me. Sanzio's absence is Alarming. Has aught happen'd in the palace? Or, as I fear, has treachery been abroad? Whatever be th'event, my course is clear; And so, as Heaven can witness, is my heart: Why need he fear, whose rule is honesty?— Count Beltran! Enter Beltran. BELTRAN. Ha! Signor, you are well met. GIOVANNI. You're but a truant reveller, my lord, To quit us at this hour. BELTRAN. Not I—not I: I can partake my fill—no stinted one— And go; but truly I have no pretence To the high glory of those Cavalieros, Who, having beat the rounds, will sit it out Till morn. I ne'er shall be a true night-scourer Like you, sweet Signor! I must sleep, i' faith. GIOVANNI. Night-scourer?—Count, I understand you not. BELTRAN. Or will not, Signor? cannot is as good; For I can wait until your wisdom finds it. Perchance the problem may be solved hereafter; 'Tis pity that the banquet's broken up. GIOVANNI. The banquet broken up? BELTRAN. Ay, sir; we lack'd Your presence, and another's, whom I name not: The master's absence ever cools the house, At least it ought—Is that not your opinion? Give you good even, Signor. GIOVANNI. Count, one word Before you go. Your words I understand not, Nor well your tone. I am no quarreller, sir; But if you mean a sneer, I'll haply find Fit comment for your text. BELTRAN. You are learned, Signor; And might, methinks—so manifold a linguist— Evolve a thing so simple. GIOVANNI. Sir, permit me To say again, I am no quarreller— Mark me—but yet no monk. If insult be Your meaning, as I think, in such a case, There's but one argument. BELTRAN. Ay?—Marry sir, I'm curious to see it. Is it aught Like that? [Half drawing his Sword. Enter Frankendall. FRANKENDALL. My lord, I am sorry to see this. You quarrel, Signor, in the Ducal Palace! GIOVANNI. I seek it not; but if a breach is sought, I'll find both time and place. BELTRAN. As you please, Signor. FRANKENDALL. I earnestly beg conference with your highness. GIOVANNI. I'll be no bar. I'm at your highness' bidding. BELTRAN. Signor, your servant. [Exit Giovanni. Ceremonious Pandar! What do'st thou want? Why did'st thou interrupt us? What ghost hast thou seen now, thou look'st so grave on't? FRANKENDALL. My lord, my lord, pull not more troubles down; They may rain fast enough upon our heads! We are alone. I must be brief, or better Had hold my tongue for ever. Would I could! Oh! I have heard a tale, my lord, which chills My very tongue. BELTRAN. A tale?—What hast thou heard? FRANKENDALL. Would I could tell it in a word! for waste Of time is murder now; at least it may be. Just ere the feast was broken up, when you Held conference with the Duke, the villain Sanzio Buzz'd in mine ear, as still such reptiles do, To curry worthless consequence, some tale Of Prince Ignatio's secret. All the while I heeded little, haply, being intent On Leonora's bearing, and her eyes, Which shot suspicion, mix'd with smother'd rage; When suddenly a sound fell on my hearing, Which fix'd me in attention, as if Gorgon Had hiss'd me into stone. The serpent told me This poor unfortunate, then a girl, was brought To Florence by a woman, her protectress— Or else abducer—in mysterious manner, Sometime about the sack of Modena. BELTRAN. The sack of Modena! FRANKENDALL. 'Twas so, my lord; You start; but yet be patient to the end. —Their ducats, of the which they had some store, It seems, were spent soon by a paramour, Who left the hag, and her supposed daughter, To starve. In short, the old duenna died; But ere she died, it seems, at divers times Threw out dark intimations, that her charge Was not that which she seem'd; and there she sprung Pre-eminent in grace, in form, in lustre, Like some stray seedling which the winds have wafted Far from the garden of its parent flowers; A solitary bud. How Prince Ignatio Found this deserted and most exquisite gem, It were too long to tell. BELTRAN. What was the name Of this accursed hag? FRANKENDALL. She was call'd Zetti; So, at the least, she call'd herself. Her tongue Spoke her a Piedmontese. BELTRAN. Where would'st thou lead me? What horror's this, within whose sudden folds Thou would'st entangle me?—Thou art my friend; At least I think so; and thine honesty Would not complot against me; howsoe'er, Thou may'st have wish'd that, which is done, were not. Thou said'st, “so, at the least, she call'd herself.” Who calls her otherwise?—Were there any doubts? FRANKENDALL. There were, my noble lord; yea, more than doubts, Or Sanzio lies. He says, that he discover'd (For the smooth hypocrite, as he well knows how, Did cant himself into her confidence, And filch'd the secret in a careless hour,) Her true name was Letitia. BELTRAN. What? FRANKENDALL. Spinelli. BELTRAN. 'Tis false! 'Tis most incredible—impossible; Unless blind chance hath cast her film, and found Eyesight o'th'sudden, and ta'en side against me! There has been whispering.—Ay; some plotting knave Has fashion'd and adapted this vile tale, To scare off interference—To alarm My feelings—I do see't. They are too late. Thus do I spurn the lie. If there be traitors, Woe to their heads. FRANKENDALL. My noble lord, you do Your pleasure. I am not a whisperer; Whether the knowledge come by craft or sorcery, I am no traitor. Whence, then, could it come? If your insinuations point at me, Your highness shall permit me to say this, That both mistrust and threats might well be spared. I am no man either to feign or fear. BELTRAN. Thou art not, Frankendall; and I have wrong'd thee. My senses reel; I know not what I think. Where is the Princess? FRANKENDALL. Ah! my lord; where is she? The menials did confusedly deny her To my inquiries; cold and short, but strange; Fear and astonishment lock'd fast their lips; They've found what stuff she's made of, e'en already: Nor can I clue the villain Sanzio; The Princess sent for him; he is not here. Where'er he be, may apoplexy strike him, Or swift paralysis wither him up, And Heaven may still shew merciful! BELTRAN. What mean'st thou? I charge thee, speak. FRANKENDALL. My lord, my noble lord, Forgive my frankness; but you have unleash'd Upon this trail—a tigress. Oh! beware She tear not your own bosom. BELTRAN. It is rent Already; for thy words both pierce and poison. I am struck down. FRANKENDALL. Oh! my dear lord, this business Was not the work for you. Believe me, 'twas not. Your highness is disorder'd. I conjure you, Rally your spirits. Something must be done, And quickly. BELTRAN. Lead me where, do what, thou wilt; But do not blame me—do not gaze upon me— I am not fit to meet an honest eye. We yet may be in time to save her—whom? I dare not trust my tongue to utter it— Her I would fain have murder'd. FRANKENDALL. My dear lord, All may be well yet. BELTRAN. Why, Heaven grant it may! I shrink from seeing what I still must know. Let us haste, Frankendall. O, fly, my friend. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Interior of a Villa on the Arno. EULALIA alone. Sleep, thou too art unkind. 'Tis a dread lot To watch and weep throughout these desolate hours. Ignatio, even thou dost not know how sad, How helpless, heartless, fearful, solitary, Is she whom all the world forsakes! Thou hast Still many a refuge—Glory—business—power— But woman—thou who art so oft cast off Like a forsaken toy—whose very weakness Should more ensure thee aid—What hap is thine? Thy bosom, whilst thou art at peace, is like The water's tranquil surface, that reflects With joy the heaven which smilingly hangs o'er it; But, when the blast once ruffles it, is dark, And shews no sunshine more. When I o'erlook These once loved tokens, they but seem to say, They must be look'd upon, be loved, no longer; As this which glitters vainly round my neck, By unknown and unknowing hands put on, But mocks my destitution. Oh! how is't? But all seems changed around me; e'en this chamber Shews like a tomb; and the night blast that sighs And plains amid the well-remember'd trees, Speaks with a stranger's voice. I start, and gaze, And fear I know not what, I know not why— Even like a wretch toss'd in a fev'rish dream, Who struggles to fill up a painful blank With shapeless terrors—whose abortive visions Are horrible nothings, void of aught defined, Save preternatural dread and restless strife. Mine eyes, which nature fain would close in sleep, Are stretch'd wide ope, as if in expectation Of some mysterious doom; and my blood burns And chills by starts—Horror!—I will recline Once more upon my couch, and pray that sleep May rest one moment on my harass'd eyelids, Though frighted fancy wildly paint the curtain With terrors worse than waking. Watch me, Heaven. [She sleeps. Enter Leonora and Sanzio. LEONORA. She sleeps, poor wretch! SANZIO. She stirs—be swift—she wakes. EULALIA. I say she moves—she moves—Look at her eyes; Though she be stone, she is not dead!—A knife! Ah! blood—Ignatio—fly. [Wakes. Where am I? 'Tis A dream! Ah! no; 'tis real—and they have come To murder me! LEONORA. Silence!—Set down the cup, And whatsoe'er thou hearest, for thy life Stir not.—Begone! [Exit Sanzio. EULALIA. Mercy!—What art thou?—Speak! LEONORA. That which I should not be for such as thou To ask; but that which I shall not be long. EULALIA. For what comest thou? Seek'st thou my life? LEONORA. Thy life! Poor reptile, think'st thou I should condescend To come for that?—Thy worthless life? I come To vindicate insulted dignity— To teach the princely serpent who dares violate The honour and the peace of Leonora, He shall not do it with impunity. No; what he measures shall be meted back With interest tenfold. I come for revenge! EULALIA. On whom? LEONORA. On thy thin-blooded paramour And thee. EULALIA. Alas! Ignatio, where art thou? LEONORA. What! darest thou call him, even to my face? EULALIA. I know it is as wrong in me to name him, As thee to speak of him as thou hast done. LEONORA. I'll hear no more!—Down, insolent strumpet!—Die, Worm, ere I trample on thee! EULALIA. Mercy! Mercy! Thou art a woman! LEONORA. Ay, an injured one! Drink, or I'll drag forth thine unlawful brat— I've heard of him—and poniard him before Thy very face! EULALIA. Oh, no, no, no; I'll die! Spare but my child! Let but his mother's eyes See him once more, or e'er they close, and use Eulalia as thou wilt. LEONORA. No more—prepare! EULALIA. But while I breathe one single prayer for him, And for myself! LEONORA. Dispatch; or else this moment Shall be the last of both! EULALIA. Tigress! [She drinks. LEONORA. 'Tis done! Now, Minion, when thy whining hypocrite Returns to visit thee, methinks he'll find thee Colder than wont. [Exit Leonora. EULALIA. My child, my child—where art thou? I cannot come to thee; my limbs have lost Their ministrance already. The fell drug Hath shared mine enemies' malice, and I feel My moments must be few. Oh, for a little, A little breath, and respite from this pain! Grant, Heaven, he live to see a happier lot Than his poor mother!—Shield, oh, shield my boy! Forgive my murderer's trespass, and mine own! I faint. His voice!—his voice!—I cannot see him; A cloud is on mine eyes; Ignatio— Ignatio—I die—farewell, Ignatio! [She dies. IGNATIO, (without.) Down, triple villain! Think'st thou blood like thine Shall stain my conscience?—Down! Enter Ignatio. All-boding powers! I am too late. Eulalia!—Death and hell Have been beforehand with me! Oh! is't possible Fate can have nipt the root, while yet the flower Doth look so lovely?—All is over now! Let me not curse; for curses, like the thunder, Reverberate back again; and mine own weakness, God knows, needs pardon. Yea, however difficult It be to see this ruin, and refrain, I will not—no, I will not imprecate Those hottest judgments that must melt the hearts Of stone that could do this. All that remains Now, is to die; and let the after few, Who, 'mid this turmoil, think it worth the while To ask the end of poor Ignatio, Spell out my story. There are precedents Anew of tyrannous fates and broken hearts, To help them through the breaks of this sad tale. I can go calmly now, though never tongue Bid peace be to my ashes. My forebodings, If they were sad, have had their uses too; And when to-night the blast moan'd strangely by, And the huge ghastly moon seem'd nearer earth Than is her use, as if she were drawn down, Seeing some horrible and loathsome deed, It arm'd me for the worst. 'Tis come; nor do I Shrink from my purpose. I can now look back On what hath pass'd, as age can do o'er childhood; And if some warmer drops, at Nature's bidding, Fall at the retrospect, they come almost Like pleasureable tears. I am resolute— If this be death, oh! who would fear to die? Too beautiful—being mortal—fare thee well! Thy love, to me, was like some airy strain, That lightly floats upon the quiet night— Brief snatch of harmony, which the ear drinks up More sweetly for the darkness that surrounds it. 'Tis gone! but its soft memory shall bring me More soothingly into the silent sleep That cures my sorrow— Ay, my dagger's best— A cup!—not empty!—yet there's venom in't. Poor victim! when thou left'st the horrid dregs Of their superfluous malice, little thought'st thou To whom thou didst bequeath them. [He drinks. It is past. One kiss, before the felon poison steals My breath away. Is it not innocent now? Come, icy lips—Oh! pure as martyrdom, And colder e'en than holiest charity, And bless me, ere I die. Come, moveless hand, And let me hold thee with my latest clasp; And when mine eye fails, and my senses reel, And the alarmed spirit scarcely hovers Round its invaded seat—I'll think thou livest, And die upon thy bosom, as I wish'd. I sink e'en now; and a strange coldness runs Through all my palsied limbs; strange noises rush To my appalled ears; and the cold drops Are trickling down my temples. One pang more, Eulalia, and I join thee, if Heaven wills. I die—not yet—Voices? I hear them now; If they be enemies, I yet have breath And strength to awe back murder. Ha! [He falls. Giovanni! 'Tis over, my Giovanni!—Thou hast come In time to see me die! Enter Giovanni and the Duke. My father! Oh! While yet mine ear hath life to drink the sound, Pardon! DUKE. Ay, ten times pardon; only live, My boy! my wrong'd Ignatio! IGNATIO. 'Tis too late; Death is too potent for obedience To aught excepting him. Thou weep'st, Giovanni, And seem'st to look that this should not have been. GIOVANNI. My looks may not be, but my tears are true. IGNATIO. Look there; look there; and let that answer thee. Philosophy hath no balm for broken hearts; And when I kiss'd her pale and clay-cold lips, I could not think them marble. Raise me up, That I may gaze upon them once again, Before mine eyes be gone, for they wax dim. Enter Beltran and Frankendall. BELTRAN. If her tongue spoke not, yet her eyes glared death— I'll see the worst, although these bloody stains Shew murder hath been here. Ha! Is it death? Look, Frankendall, for I dare look no more; And tell me that this horror cannot be. FRANKENDALL. Be calm, my lord. BELTRAN. Calm! Look upon that brow, Those marble lips and bloodless lineaments— Oh, God! it is my mother's monument! Yet, if 'twere she, would not my very gaze Make the blood ooze from forth her innocent veins? I'm desperate, and I will be satisfied.— My friend, lift up that lock that lies upon The snowy temple—there—and tell me what Thou see'st; for worlds durst I not touch that brow. Do'st thou see aught? FRANKENDALL. A scar, my noble lord— A faint blue scar, as from some hap of childhood. BELTRAN. Where? FRANKENDALL. Here, my noble lord—Look not again; You are much moved. BELTRAN. It is—it is my sister! It chokes me—does it not? But I shall scarce Speak it again. I should have died or e'er I spoke the word—nor is it fit I live A breath beyond it. She is dead; and I Have murder'd her. FRANKENDALL. What would you do, my lord? BELTRAN. Mark you—He dies, who would have given his life To lengthen hers one hour; and shall I live To crawl, like Cain, abhorr'd and unforgiven? Stand off! IGNATIO. I hear the voice of pain, but not Its import. Who is he talks of forgiveness? If that he hath been enemy of mine— For I have had too much of enmity— I do forgive him. BELTRAN. Thou?—First hear me; then If thou forgiv'st me, there is hope of Heaven. I am thy rival, and thine enemy; The secret underminer of thy peace; The envious cloud that overcast thy morn, And turn'd it into tears; the worm that pierced The heart of the sweet blossom of thy love; The blight that struck the harvest of thy hopes; Thy traitor brother; thy Eulalia's murderer! Now, if thou dar'st, forgive me!—Thou do'st well To pause. IGNATIO. I do forgive thee—for revenge Is not for me. One thing before I die— Ere the strong poison hath expell'd my spirit, Go, yonder, and bring hither my dear boy. [Exit Giov. I trouble you—but it will not be long. Turn me a little, that mine eyes may see What they would dwell on latest, till they close; When I have pass'd, let those who must perform The last most awful office to the dead, Outstretch us, side by side. Enter Giovanni, with the Boy. My boy!—I faint— Let me, before I'm dark, have strength to see My father's hand upon my infant's head. I die content. Bless him! oh, bless him! bless him! [He dies. DUKE. Oh! lay him gently down—'tis over—I Am childless now. Why dost thou kneel to me? BELTRAN. To know if haply penitent humbleness May buy one drop of respite to my soul, Before I go from hence, to seek some place Where I might die, who cannot live with honour. DUKE. Thy father was a brave and noble soldier; And if thou diest like him, he could not wish thee A better death. Judgment is not for us. Fate hath been here at work, as well as thou; And we must bow submissive. Here, even here, Yea, in the presence of that innocent victim, And my dead son—whose souls, now reunited, Hover above, and witness what I say— Let it be comfort in thine agony, To know I do remit thee. Rise, and go; And Heaven have mercy on thee. But, oh! never Be voice of thine heard by this ear again! If I can pardon, I cannot forget. Begone—before I turn mine eyes that way, To the remembrance that I was a father! [The Curtain drops.</field>
