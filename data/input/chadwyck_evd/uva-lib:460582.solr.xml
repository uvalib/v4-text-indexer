      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Public Walk in Naples. Cimbelli and Castro. CIMBELLI. Where did you rest last night? CASTRO. I slept at Capua. CIMBELLI. Fortune is kind in this, at least my fortune, Who makes us meet so early. CASTRO. I have heard That she has shewn her kindness of late, By happier signs than this. CIMBELLI. Not so, believe me, And yet I am content: I treat her Grace Much as I treat my Cynthia, when she smiles, Kiss her for smiling; when she frowns I kiss her To make her smile again. CASTRO. Why this is wisdomâ If we had left the drum to study greek, We could have learnt no more. CIMBELLI. A plague on learning! Wise men are wise by nature; for myself, I did not follow Wisdom, Wisdom liked And followed me. She found me on my legs, A Peripatetic to the chin. But tell me, Why come to Naples now? to see the Bay And visit Churches; look upon a Statue And yawn? Lent lasts till Midsummer this year. The king is gone, the duke, the fleet, the courtiersâ Our catguts are unscrewedâno plays, nor music, Processions all put offâand worst of all, The ladies grown litigious. CASTRO. Sad indeed! The king hath sailed for Spain? CIMBELLI. Our geese were sure That he loved Naples best; but lo! his kingship Wisely prefers their acre to our rood, Slips on his brother's stool as soon as empty, And leaves us wondering here. CASTRO. His son gone too? CIMBELLI. Not farâhe will come back again. The duke, And bearer to his Grace of brains and beard, The prince of Andriaâviscounts, counts and barons, The noblest of our nobles, Naples' giants, Most loyally run the risk of catching cold, And wait upon the king toward Spain. The fleet Divides at sea, one half attends his person, And one returns. CASTRO. Whatâis the duke your viceroy? CIMBELLI. Some say, our king. CASTRO. Duke Ferdinand?âso young? He seem'd a boy last year. CIMBELLI. He is one still, And kind enough withal: but kind or crabbed, Or young, or old, the viceroy, or the king, It matters not to us: the tail of Spain Must go where goes the head. CASTRO. What think the people? CIMBELLI. That bread is cheap enough, and grapes too dear. The people think! there are, indeedâbut hush! Who lov'd not Spain before, abjure her now, Would, if they could, be free; and therefore rather That children ruled than men. CASTRO. And one of these Is good Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. You must know my friends, But first and best Arezzi. CASTRO. What Arezzi? CIMBELLI. Prince Andria's ward. CASTRO. The Count you wrote about? CIMBELLI. The sameâno, not the same, but changed; he then Was merry like myself; now flat or froward, Much given to splenetic thoughts, chin-deep in love, Warped all awry, soon vexed, and prone to squabble, Too hasty with his sword. CASTRO. My dear Cimbelli, Is this the first and best? CIMBELLI. Yet generous, noble, Unspotted, artlessâWhat is ill came late, And will away again. CASTRO. But when! who brought it? CIMBELLI. Love and his guardian Andria. It were hard To tell his history. His parents died, He scarcely two spans long. They lovedâwere married; Fled secretly, and perished in their flight At sea. Andria was next of kin; he found And nursed the child as hisâhe has no other; Arezzi lived at court. The duchess, there Made him companion to her nieceâone dish, One cradle served them both, and now who wonders If they should choose one bed! The duchess frowns, Prince Andria frowns; the duke affects his cousinâ Your boy last year is old enough for thatâ Arezzi pines at heart; but strangest yet, This guardian Andria, who was kind till late, Now deals perversely, stints his kinsman's purse, And grows unjust throughout. Come, let us find him. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Royal Palace in Naples. Arezzi and Cicilia. AREZZI. Prince Andria and the duchess both forbid it? And now we may not speak, nor see each other, This they call just! CICILIA. Yes, we may see and speak, But not as lovers. AREZZI. How then elseâas friends? You say so too, Cicilia? Well, henceforth, friends! And thus we fall more easily. It is The temperate grade upon a sinking scale, Where honor sticks awhile as love is changing; Tired Fancy's bating place; a comma mark'd 'Twixt faith and fraudâthe shower before a thawâ Consumption's hecticâor a breath to cool The blistering scalds of perjury and shame!â Love's short and dreary twilight ends in storms! The incense on his altar once put out, Will burn no more. Those fires, like Vesta's, last Pure and immutable while faith preserves them But lost, they leave a portent in their place; The censor cool'd they never light again. We, that have lov'd so long, must talk of friendship! Garnish our goodly thoughts in gracious words, And end with trash like this! CICILIA. But why blame me? AREZZI. Can love, through choice recede, and step by step Descend as he ascended? O! but softly; You may remind me that my folly runs Too fast before your wisdom. You are wise, Those lips have never promised love! their smiles Were happy things to dream of, and my pride, Gave mute looks, words. CICILIA. Then faith stands clear; you say I never promised love? AREZZI. I do. CICILIA. If soâ Shame, which has kept me silent, dies with hope: I promise now. But this seems hard, Arezzi, Thus ever when we meet, distrust and blame! Is only one unhappy?âboth are bound With fetters which we must not hope to break, And if we might, say, would we? AREZZI. I will doubt No moreâsuspect thee! wretched as I was, Unjust, ungrateful, undeserving ever, To be thus happy now! CICILIA. Ah! wherefore happy? Love must be silent here: his wings themselves, Which flutter lightly o'er the fond and blessed, Might waken who would part us. AREZZI. Let them wake, then; Shall we, whose servitude has easier names, With blood as noble as their own, and hearts As high as theirs, still eat the bread they give In fear, forsooth, and thankfulness? endure Rebuke with reverenceâcurtesy when they smileâ Do, or do not; nay love and hate by ruleâ Go as their horses go, now checked or urged, Approved and patted, threatened and chastised,â And this because they feed us? CICILIA. It were just To sayâbecause they love us: they have earned Their right, by doing good, to do their willâ At least be just, Arezzi. AREZZI. For myself I would that they had left me where they found, To thrive or perish as high Heaven saw best, So I might thank none else. CICILIA. We may miscal A thankless spirit, a great one. Who besides Would talk of tyranny here? The laws consign The orphan to its kindredâme they placed Safe in a two-fold wardship; first, of blood, And, next, of sovereignty. The king transferred His office to his sister, and I live Where bounty shows its attributes, but hides Its face and nameâa daughter of their house, A child, and not a subject. AREZZI. I alas! I but a sort of pigmy too, must bear A burden huge as Etna, and my loins Raw with the torment of this burning debt, Be scorched as well as wearied. Well, well, well, I will repent, confess myself unjustâ Ungrateful! say not soâyou shall not think so, Nor henceforth find it so. From my soul, Cicilia, I reverence both. CICILIA. Prove that by what you do; It is the mock of service to profess All other duties but the one thing bidden, And start from that. AREZZI. Ah! that is all, or more Than all besideâthe excepted fruit withheld, Has marred their Paradise! CICILIA. Nay, then, farewell. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Cloisters in the Monastery of St. Ignazio.âA bell tolling. Enter Savelli meeting Gerardo and Ludovico. GERARDO. The abbey lacks an abbotâwe a father. SAVELLI. I learnt it from the bell. LUDOVICO. Alas! but now, The good old man is taken to his rest! SAVELLI. How did his spirit pass? LUDOVICO. As we should pray That yours may do and mine; it left behind A smile to grace its dust. GERARDO. Yet one stood near Who thought he called for help; but I did not, Nor heard him speak. LUDOVICO. They held the rood before, And there his eyes were steady till their sight Was scaled and dimm'd by death. SAVELLI. So, peace be with him! His end was happy. LUDOVICO. Such, as such a life The best deserves. GERARDO. Yet good men die in fear Sometimes, and ill ones calmly. LUDOVICO. While the flesh Holds, yea though loosely, on the fluttering spirit, It still hath power. SAVELLI. Well, may his sleep be bless'd; We live to suffer here. GERARDO. It has been thoughtâ And men think what they wishâthat one of you Shall keep his chair from vacancy, and hold The staff he leaves. SAVELLI. All look toward Ludovico. LUDOVICO. I think not so, nor wish it so: the duke Will choose more wisely. [Enter a Monk, who says to Ludovicoâ One would speak without. LUDOVICO. To meet again. Adieu! [Exeunt. GERARDO. He thinks not so, Nor wishes that it should be so: good now, This man of truth tells lies! there is not one Amongst so many, from himself and thee, To him that lights the lamps and swings the censor, Cook, porter, verger, sacristan, or dean, But would be abbot if he could. Men look, Even as thou saidst, toward him. the duke, the while, Our seedling Agamemnon out at sea, The king of men, may look a different way Toward good Savelli. From my soul I think That none tell truth; that not a man who lives But lies; that Ludovico liesâthat he For whom they ring those bells, did much the same, And dying smiled to think how many fools He left behind him. Thou and I, Savelli, Do wrong to one another; thou dost hold Thy friend a knave, an eminent knave; and I Think worse, the while, of mine. Yet prithee, why? Each knows his partner best, what cards he plays, And when he cheats, how shufflesâif he knew The others in the game as wellâ SAVELLI. Peace, peace! It is not so Gerardo. Men like us Are prone to err in this. There is a fault Most dangerous in contempt, and some have fallen, Who judged as thou. We should know well our brethren: There are both bad and good, some wise, some foolish. GERARDO. So be itâthe wise man's wisdom does but this, It hides his follies; and the good man's goodness Is fraud in luck. Should two as old as we are, Whose puppets dance all day before the sun, Doubt if some Punch abroad be not a god, And call his candles stars? Name one man honest. SAVELLI. This Ludovico stands within his cell The same as in the face of men and Heaven; And so did he just dead. GERARDO. Now who knows that? Why think not so of me? my gown is worn As bare as theirsâa frail and mortified man, Once frail, now mortified! and for thyself, Thou hast a fasting face: fair Nature saves Thee, her foul child, one lie, and kindly takes That sin upon herselfâmakes thee look pale, Grave, temperate, chaste, and pious. Some have said, âWhat reverend man goes there?ââthey might have stared Indeed, if they had seen thee where thou wentest, And striven with their own eyes. Then for thy words, They drop upon men's hearts like showers in June, When blows the south wind grossly. Who that hears Thinks of the blight and worm!â SAVELLI. More than thou knowest, If Heaven have made me what thou sayest, and art; A sort of atmosphere surrounds the goodâ Some subtile exhalation from within, Not seen, but felt; another too the wicked, Each as its kind in nature. Know thee not! I hail'd thee at a league. In twenty years This Ludovico wears unfray'd throughout, And will do twenty more. GERARDO. If I were found, It was by instinct, then: but other men Lack something of that sympathy; and few Can feel the wind, as thou canst, fair or foul, And damp or dry, an hour before it blow. A moral weathergage, a magnet primed And pointing blank toward sin; a crow-beaked spirit Which scents the carrion ere the man be dead, Follows the marching carcase. SAVELLI. Prithee be quiet. At present we have much to think and do. The fleet comes homeward; it is seen, they say, From Procita, far off. Let gales like these Blow all night long, the duke will land to-morrow. GERARDO. We must not loiter then. SAVELLI. Brother be wary: Greatness lies broad before us, ruin and shame On either side. GERARDO. We shall go safely through. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Castle of St. Elmo, commanding a view of Naples and the Bay. Arezzi and Cimbelli. CIMBELLI. But why so fast Arezzi? hills like this Need cooler time of day; or one whose veins Are shrunken conduits to diluted wine At last let dry; whose flesh was fed on salads; A thing of kid-skin bleach'd; a moon adorerâ Endymion's proxyâlord of dreams and visionsâ A loving Lent-observing priest of Cupidâ A natural ghostâa sigh-embodied spectreâ Anacreon's cricketâ AREZZI. Rest that tongue a little, Thy legs do well enough, but who can prate, Or hear thee prate untir'd? It is as hard To drag thee chattering on a hill like this, As to Vesuvius' top if trudg'd in silence. CIMBELLI. Well then, go mount alone: I seat me here, And so adieu! Wouldst drive me like an ass? Whip me because I tarry? AREZZI. Thou didst stop To bray, not rest. Come rouse theeâone step more, And we are there. CIMBELLI. They cannot land so soon, The fleet lies two miles off. And why the summit? Why to the top of all? That we may stand So much the nearer to the sun, and melt So much the faster? AREZZI. Good goose, that we may see So much the farther. CIMBELLI. Good or not, the goose Is bilious liver'd, and hates roasting there. What hinders that we see as clearly hence? Is there a boat upon the bay, a sail, I might have said a sea-birdâon the beach, A net hung up, a mast, a rope, an oar, But we may see it here? AREZZI. Well, then, sit still. CIMBELLI. Behold the end of fasting! surfeits choke Such thriftless abstinence! They say it clears The visual organ, strengthens and extends All sorts of seeing, both of mind and body, Within us and without us: but alas! This lover grows stone blind. Cupid transforms His servant to his likenessâas the god, So blinks the worshipper. Farewell then tears, And sighs, and empty bellies! I would see, As I see now, Vesuvius lift unbent His feathery column whitening toward the skies, And that pure Heaven behind himâsee the isles Rest on the smooth blue wavesâthe mountain sides Look dark and highâthe populous shores beneath Black with their swarming multitudesâmast heads And city roofs all thronged. AREZZI. A race, a raceâ Now eyes, now tongue! If the new king should need In his new realm a poetâone who sees A shrimp a mile, the nails in Pegasus' shoes, Castalia's minnows, and on Pindus' side How green the grasshoppersâ [Cannons are fired. CIMBELLI. I pray be still! AREZZI. The ears start last: what dost thou hear, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. How long the flash and smoke foreran the sound! It is the dukeâhe leaves his ship for land, That inmost barge is his. AREZZI. A hundred more Attend him home, or meet him. CIMBELLI. They which bear Their double banners gaily in the stern, Have with them sweetest music. AREZZI. Thou canst hear The flutes, but I cannot. CIMBELLI. What hear them here! Said I, I heard them? AREZZI. Didst thou not, even now, Commend the music, call it sweet, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. And so it is, no doubt. Marry, these pipers Shall learn the Duke's good-morrow to his Bride, And play your Farewell Elegyâthey are The best in Naples. AREZZI. O! my soul is sick, And this is murder to it.â [Cannons are heard again. CIMBELLI. The guns again! This shot is from the castle; when he lands, The mole will give the third. AREZZI. Nay, hark! even still The echo rolls around usâIschia answersâ And now the mountains!âIt was here that once I watched, by night, the tempest, till this rock Shook from its roots; and in the light'nings blazeâ Though all was fourfold darkness when they ceasedâ I saw Vesuvius and the waves between, As plain as I do now. CIMBELLI. What thing on earth, Or what beneath it, could tempt wise men here In such a night as this? AREZZI. Ill spirits, of whom The worst was Jealousy. CIMBELLI. Sweet Count, good byeâ Nay, do not move: I would not knowingly make This devil's best friends mine own. He is a coxcomb, Apt to take things awry, turn blue to black, And white to yellowâhe might grow scrupulous of myself, And so I leave youâ(going out he meets Savelli.) Bless us! who comes next? The same we spoke about! AREZZI. Good day, good father. SAVELLI. It is the better that I find you here; And yet not good, Arezzi. CIMBELLI. World! O! world! All sort of men are moonstruck or possessed, Priests, elders, bachelors, and those with wivesâ All wretched, all forlorn, all prone to darkness, All tempted, vexed, tormented! I would find Some wizard, with his almanack, to learn The worst at once. SAVELLI. Young man this mirth is folly. There wants no almanack to tell the wise Ill jests are jests ill-timed. CIMBELLI. But hear me, fatherâ There is a reason for my mirth. SAVELLI. What is it? CIMBELLI. One little spark remains to light mankind, And that grows dim. Wouldst take my bellows from me, Leave us in utter darkness, shake thine ears Because, forsooth, I puff to keep thee warm?â Buffet thy friend?â SAVELLI. I do repent Cimbelli, My heart was sore, and thou didst touch it roughly. CIMBELLI. Poor hearts! one bruised, one broken! Love like Death, Smites all alikeâthe teacher and the taught! Nor heeds he now the old man's length of beard, The wise man's depth of knowledge, or with both The churchman's height of grace!â SAVELLI. Be merry ever, We will not chide againâ'twere just to bear Our griefs ourselvesâ CIMBELLI. What griefs?â SAVELLI. Go, goâno matter. AREZZI. Say what they are.â SAVELLI. The father of our house Is taken from us!â CIMBELLI. Who? SAVELLI. Our abbot. CIMBELLI. Gone? SAVELLI. Departed yesterday. CIMBELLI. What deadâdeceased! The abbot dead? SAVELLI. He left us here at noon. CIMBELLI. S'blood let him go then! by that beard, I thought To hear of some worse mischiefâflames, volcanos; A battle lostâanother nunnery buildingâ An earthquake, deluge, famineâthat the vines Were withered to the rootsâthat men must drink Henceforth from brooks like sheep! and while this dread Made my teeth chatterâlo! it endsââthe abbot âDeceased, departed, taken from us, goneâ âThe father of our house!ââHe might have had My leave to go, and all his children with him. Frightened to death for this!âWhat, did he keep The cellar key, and take it in his pocket? Will no one wear his mitreâno kind pate Through love or charity? AVELLI. The task were easy To find a head, but hard to chuse one fit. The covering seems too costly for a block, Too weighty for a shell so cracked and empty As this of thine. CIMBELLI. Among so many shorn, There are your sheep's-heads, lamb's-heads, ram's-heads, goat's-heads; The last have beards to wear, but truck their horns In change for fleeces with the flock. Come, prithee Why shouldst not thou be abbot? SAVELLI. Count, farewell! I have not strength to-day for wars like these: The daw pursues the raven.âI will keep A graver word or two for you. CIMBELLI. The Countâ Who stands regardless there, like some church cock, Too high in air to hear the preacher's doctrineâ Hath present need of wisdom: as for me, I have enough. Stand fast, and take my placeâ Exhort, admonish. I must hence to court, Where grave words gender spleen, and true ones, sport. [Exit. SAVELLI. You should go too, Arezzi. AREZZI. I should, but cannot. SAVELLI. You will be asked for, and this splenetic court May read your could notâwould not. AREZZI. Let it do so: Both versions are the true. SAVELLI Come, comeâthe wise Will learn to fondle what they do not love. This harlot Naples, paints her cheeks to day And feasts a younger lover. He went out A duke, and if men's certainties prove true, Returns a king. Prince Andria rules the state As vizier to our sultan. You should haste To welcome bothâtheir subject, ward, and cousin. AREZZI. Heaven keeps me of a humble mind, and so Their ward and subjectâfor the cousin, it makes me Thankful enough. A twofold service needs A threefold patience: this word kinsman seems Like gilded collar on some great man's dog, His master's wealth, not his. SAVELLI. Mark me, my son, Who cannot stand, may kneel. Such collars bind The neck of almost all: the days are gone When Naples was without them, and might call Her nobles, men. Dogs' natures need dogs' chains; Spain holds the whip and whistles to her whelpsâ Ware contumacy, Count! AREZZI. Patience, just Heaven! Who is it that provokes our shame and mocks Our fetters, but yourself? SAVELLI. Well, so I do, And ought to do, and will doâtill I find The lash too heavy for the back. Be humbleâ The patience that you pray for comes at last To render baseness easier. What I hate Is this ambiguous and unnatural thing Which wags its idiot head about the streets, And must be worshippedâhonor, in good sooth! Nobility, what not! pure blood! high lineage! Patrician pride!âwhy, prithee, gentle Countâ And gentle seems the Count's addition hereâ Is pride for you or me? should slaves look greatly? And those, whose masters are a subject's servants, Boast of their ancestry?âWe! these rocks beneath us Seem to upbraid the coward for his boasts, And teach us shame! the feet of heroes trod Even where we stand, while Pleasure and Repose Prepared their myrtles in the cool alcove, Or spread the purple couch for glorious toil. These are the mountains where they gazedâwe see Their tombs and temples round usâwe usurp The labor of their hands, and build our homes With fragments left from their'sâwe know their shapes, Boast of their lineage, read their wills as heirs, And fix their statues in our groves and halls! We slaves do this! Spain sends barbarian kings To rule in Naples:âScipio's bondmen now May scourge his children! AREZZI. Wherefore this to me? SAVELLI. That shame may teach thee meekness, my proud son. Go, show thy duty toward the dukeâhe is Too mighty for a rival, now; so smile And kiss his princely hand, and he will be Thy gracious master. Thou shalt have, in time, Some other wife. AREZZI. If not, I hope to find Some better comforter. Bless thee, Savelli! Thou shalt preach patience to the fiends, and stir Their fires around them while they hear. Look down, And out of all those thousands, chuse one man So manacled in spirit as I, or fenced So close by circumstance from what he would; And see which stirs the first. SAVELLI. Ah! thus it isâ Life swarms with hindrances: its pebbles grow To rocks and stumbling blocks. Our gnats and flies Are vulture-winged. The cobwebs of the world Catch and enchain its giants. One dares much, But cannotâwhy? he fills a place at court. A second is in love. A third sits patient As kinsman to a kinsman of the Duke. This has a guardian near the throneâthe other Was once his highness' playmate. While we hang, Entangled by our feathers half life through, From twigs like these, that merciless hand draws nearâ Gently indeed at first, yet hard as Death'sâ To grasp the courtier's wand, the kinsman's honors, The ward's whole patrimonyâit thrusts apart The lover and his mistressâbut it leaves The patriot's doubts! If all men felt as we do, Rome had found kinder matrons for her kings, And Brutus gloried in his son!âbut come. [Exeunt. SCENE V. An apartment in the Palace. Duchess, Cicilia, and Prince of Andria. DUCHESS. We talk, and wiselyâpolitic bothânay one Can mingle with his speech a traveller's tales Of winds and seas; while tired and idly by, Cicilia muses till these grave words endâ Say something of the duke. CICILIA. Prince Andria brings His earliest offerings to your Grace, the last He keeps for me. PRINCE ANDRIA. His highness, when he comes, Shall make soft vows for both. DUCHESS. O! use does much; Cicilia, tell him he hath practised long: Prince Andria whispered in thy mother's ear Vows, ere the duke was bornâhis lips were there As constant as her ear-rings. CICILIA. They appear A kind of heir-loom, common to the house, Hereditary things which once were precious: Their fashion suits the setting of the times, And shall become your Grace. DUCHESS. Well, now my brother, How were his looks at last? PRINCE ANDRIA. Even such they were As suited better with his mind than fortuneâ Kind, gracious, but not happy. DUCHESS. He has left His happier thoughts with us, but Heaven, which gave him So much of honor here, will bless his days With larger glory on a loftier throne, And raise him friends in Spain. PRINCE ANDRIA. He loved us well; Naples was what he made it: but in Spain Things rest on custom, and he will be there Greater, indeed, not happier. DUCHESS. Tell me next, What day it was you left him? PRINCE ANDRIA. Our Lady's Eve; Till then the winds, which bore him forth toward Spain, Seemed loth to speed his passage, yet ashamed To leave his fluttering sails unfilledâby fits They lingered and returned, pursued, then tarried, And did their office sorrowing. Here, at length, Sardinia lay before us, with her hills Higher than the sun declined. O'er the glazed sea Some long blue streaks stretched darkening in the breeze, All else was motionless. The fleet lay closeâ Shadowing its burnished image in the deepâ So that we saw the pomp, and heard the soundsâ Mistress of many nations. Each thronged shipâ As well as that we sailed in with the kingâ Had lowered its standard till the mass was said, And while they sang the vespers. Never yet Has music seemed so holy! We were there, Who jointly in this world should hear no more What we had heard so oft. At last the king Said something good to each; embraced his son; And bade us, if indeed we were his friends, To honor whom he left us. For myselfâ He placed me next the duke, and spoke at large Of faith long tried, and services approved, Which, though they pleased me, shamed me. While we knelt, The tear was in his eye, and when the barge Bore us in sorrow from his side, he said âCommend me to my sister.â DUCHESS. Ah! I feared That he might hold him doubtful if I loved, And so himself love less. It seemed unkind To let him part without me, and to chuseâ Though suffered freely as I wasâmy home, Here from his own thus far. PRINCE ANDRIA. Not so, believe me; He did not think it so, but twice he said, âNow that the pang is past, the choice ends well; âI leave my son, my friends.â DUCHESS. Generous still! The same Don Carlos ever. And the duke Returns a sovereign to his father's throne, In all but name, a king? PRINCE ANDRIA. He is, toward Spain, A son, and not a subject. We but wait Awhile in policy, he then will bear The name and sceptre of a king. DUCHESS. It is As I have wished indeed. The good shall see Dominion well conferred, and well divided: Spain has outgrown her strength; the trunk, though large, Hath stretched its giant arms too far, and now It sickens with their weight. [Enter the Duke. PRINCE ANDRIA. Behold! the Duke. DUKE. Health to my gracious Aunt, and what beside Is fairest, holiest. PRINCE ANDRIA. Hath she not beside her, That which is fair and holy? DUKE. Both indeed Forgive me, dear CiciliaâI mistook, Forget, I never could. PRINCE ANDRIA. Mistaken twiceâ Your highness' rights are twofold nowâas prince, And kinsman tooâso why not twofold kisses? In this the king was wiser. DUCHESS. It bodes ill To stumble at the threshold of a reignâ Prince Andria counsels prudently, for kings Should show their power at first. CICILIA. Then let his Grace Begin with some hard enterprise, and close Prince Andria's mouth. PRINCE ANDRIA. This counsel is the same I gave myself, save that the mouth is not.â His highness made long prayers. DUKE. My aunt will pardon. It was as she has taught me: I should gain Rebukes, not smiles, if what I owed to her Were paid the first, while slowly, out of place, My debts to Heaven came next. DUCHESS. Even from the shore The younger hastened to his prayers, and blessed Good guidance hence and homeâthe elder ran To gossip here with women! now pass on. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Public Walk. Arezzi and Savelli. SAVELLI. We shall unriddle mysteries, and absolve Whether in this young world, new fortune meet us, Or we must take the old. AREZZI. But tell me how? SAVELLI. By asking something warmly, suing, urging, Making one point the pivot of your will, Still begging more, entreating. AREZZI. By mine honor I would not for the crown. SAVELLI. The crown! the coxcomb! It is not for the crownâwellâlet it be, This honor seems engaged to do no good; It will not serve its friends. AREZZI. What wouldst thou have? SAVELLI. That which I do not covet. I tell thee, Count, I must be abbotâcrowns with us are mitres, And one stands void: yet, for myself, I care No more than thou for thine. We love our brethren, And would do kindly to the kindâthey wish it, For them I wish it too. The poor lack bread, The naked shelter! we shall see, beside, Whether we judge this guardian by our spleen, What are our hopes hereafter. I shall be A rule to take the measure of his thoughts; If he refuse, look wisely toward thy fortunes, If not, he loves thee still. AREZZI. I need not try him. SAVELLI. Well, wellâthen others will. I am not left So naked by my friends, that such a prayer Will be refused me twice. AREZZI. Have patience, father. SAVELLI. Patience!âwell patienceâif I lack such here, It is because the first of twenty wishesâ Not blown by forced suggestion whence they came, But prompt, though false, that sometime something good, By some kind chance might rise to prove your loveâ Should slink and stagger like a threatener bearded, And cite your honor for its haltâyour honor! AREZZI. I would not ask it for myself. SAVELLI. Nor shall you Do more for me: this were to profit bothâ But let us now forget it; when I try Your love again, the folly will be double, Till then, adieu! AREZZI. Nay, prithee fatherâcomeâ I will do any thing you wish. SAVELLI. Then hear me. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Apartment in the Palace. Duchess and Cicilia. DUCHESS. My spirit is more perplexed to dayâthe day I looked for rest. CICILIA. It is but seldom thus. DUCHESS. Why noâfor that, thank Heaven! our blood runs freely, Nor frozen nor fired; but now I grieve to seem Unkind, or worseâunjust: Arezzi flies me; And thou too, child, though wiser, nobler, better, Of more enduring natureâ CICILIA. What!âyour Grace Will not distrust my love? DUCHESS. Come hither then. Dost thou not love Arezzi too? CICILIA. Your highness Hath ever seemed content that I should do so. DUCHESS. I have, indeed, till now. CICILIA. Nor hear I yet, Why I should not. DUCHESS. My altered will, Cicilia. CICILIA. That shall command my duties; yet forgive If what grows mightier than mine own will, prove Almost too strong for yours. DUCHESS. Till late, you say, I seemed consenting to his love? CICILIA. I thought so. DUCHESS. And so I didâI nursed its growthâand since Have ever passed it smiling. Now our will Turns back, not to rebuke, but bid it end: Can this seem just? CICILIA. Why not? it were indeed A starved and sickly faith, which lives no more Than while it feeds on blessingsâwhat I know Is manifest good; I will believe the same Of that which I know not. DUCHESS. Bless thee! Ciciliaâ Thus ever swiftest in the race of goodness; I follow, shamed, far off! but God forbid, To bruise a heart like thine, or wrong with scruples Its truth and singleness! Come near me, childâ I can trust tooâthou knowest I love Arezzi? CICILIA. Not less than you love me. DUCHESS. I love him better. CICILIA. Even this I will not envy him, and yet I thought not so before. DUCHESS. Ye both were mine, By unpresuming wisdom thou, a spirit Princely yet meek, and far too just for pride. Yet he, though froward, and less in grace than thou art, Is more mine own by nature. CICILIA. How so? DUCHESS. He is Nearer in blood by much. CICILIA. In natureâ DUCHESS. Thatâ No matter what we call itâinstinct, yearning, Which all-preserving Nature showers abroad O'er mothers' hearts, to make their sorrows dear, And waken tenderness through painâdost blush? CICILIA. I knew not that I didâArezzi's mother! DUCHESS. I give the key to wonder, but beware Lest some injurious and ambiguous thought Should enter too. My honor keeps its place As high as suits the daughter of a king, Don Carlos' sisterâha? CICILIA. Your Grace mistakes me. The Count Arezzi yours? DUCHESS. My son, Ciciliaâ Prince Andria's sonâthy kinsman. This has been The unquiet growth of more than twenty yearsâ Look! how amazement tends to ecstacyâ Dost hear me speak? CICILIA. Prayâprayâ DUCHESS. I who abhor The reptile traversings of dubious souls, Have stooped to this. It could not be through shame, For Andria was the image by whose gold The noblest swore, and o'er whose laurell'd head Was honor superscribedâhis sovereign's friend, The people's idol. Women when they loved, Would feign some likeness 'twixt their choice and him, And men grew proud to think it suchâhe was What now Arezzi might be. CICILIA. Why not love him? DUCHESS. Because he was a subjectâand my brother Had scorned to call him his. Through this, our marriage Was hidden unhonor'd and half blessed. CICILIA. The Count Arezziâ That Count Arezzi, then, whose name he bears, Is but a dream! DUCHESS. There was a Count Arezzi, Young, wealthy, well alliedâbut rash and hated, Prince Andria's kinsman. Threatened and pursued, He fled with one he loved, to Florence, Pisa, Abode in Rome, and sailed, at last, toward Spain, But perished in his flight. The time accorded; Andria was next in blood: their mystery lent Our child a name, which justly we might give him, As ours and hisâit placed him in our sight, His father's ward. CICILIA. How many thoughts come home Till now forgot, which find their place unfilled, Like martlets to their last year's nest in spring, Disused, and yet familiar. DUCHESS. This love between you Grew on unblamed and blameless. We descried In him its present usefulness, to charm Impure suggestions from the spirit of youth, And turn its fires to profit: we believed A future good to both: but Fortune thwarts us, Another sovereign rules, the duke loves too. CICILIA. As children doâno more than I love him. DUCHESS. It matters not if thought so young may die Ere fancy change to passion. Youthful dreams Are mighty while they last. We must not say âArezzi loved the first, give placeââour strength Is Ferdinand's pleasure; and beside all this, Naples looks kindly on the boyâit shows Truly, though ignorantly, a parent's fondness, While we of Spain grow alien. There are around us Who might awake ill-fears. Arezzi stands, With you, too near the throne. CICILIA. Your Grace shall guide me; But still remember thisâyou have not found, In twenty years, that Time can conquer Faith, Or Wisdom Natureâjudge my heart by your's. DUCHESS. I do, and find it pure where mine is not. Whyâbless thee, childâthat which is told may show How much I trust thee, and the time to come Shall prove my love. If either had been less, I could have kept my secret still. CICILIA. Your Grace Shall not repent its loss. DUCHESS. Things changed from good May change again from evil. Prince Andria waits A message to us both from Spain; with that We learn the worstâbutâtill it comeâCicilia, Promise that prayers and sighs shall not prevail Above the faith between us. CICILIA. I promise. DUCHESS. Lock what you hear from all, and, most, Arezzi. Be wise and secret, child, till then. CICILIA. I will. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Palace Stairs. Savelli and Gerardo. SAVELLI. Tell him that all men wish itâpush him hard, But warily: say that the abbot died With his last hopeâthat, as for me, the honor Is known, not sought, and felt, not coveted.â Now go, and with good speed. GERARDO. But conscience, brother! Three lies as preface to a deadly sin, And simony to boot!âWhy, no man wished it; And abbot never hoped it; thou dost covet; And I expect some profit! SAVELLI. Wellâbe wiseâ It is a day to prosper in. We come The earliest suitors to this half-grown king, And he will give to show that he is graciousâ The Count shall follow next. GERARDO. The Count indeed Is wisely led, so may he come to grace. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Chamber in the Palace. Prince of Andria and the Duchess. DUCHESS. You should have done it then. The tide at flood Ran high, but missed, this bark where all our hopes Are stored and destined for the days to comeâ Lies idly on the perilous strand of time, To rot or perish. PRINCE ANDRIA. But I could not do it, And yet it will be done. DUCHESS. I trusted to you, Or would have dared myself. Our brother's nature Grew softer, and his spirit was more inclined, While the winds called him from me. Men disclose Their nature's frailties to observant eyes Not least when least they feel them. Wherefore else This double tenderness, and threefold friendship, If those who love must partâbut that the hours Of passed communion were disturbed by folly, Or fed to surfeiting? Had I knelt then And owned that we deceived him, told our vows, Our marriage, that Arezzi was our child, The rest a fableâscattered and dissolved This cloud-built mystery of twenty yearsâ He would have found a reason for our guile In his late pride, weighed your deservings justly, And left us here forgivenâI gave the task, Through shame, to you. PRINCE ANDRIA. I did engage to do it, And failed, I own, through fear. The eve we left him There was an hour for nature and kind thoughts, When both drew farther from their place, and met As level friends between. We spoke of Naples, Duke Ferdinand, and youâyour presence here, Your honors in the stateâand then I touched, But tenderlyâthe eyeball of our hopes, And talked of age and marriage. âHer graceââI saidâ âClimbs yet toward noon, but wedlock, to be blessed, âShould not be laterâwhile Life's wheel turns round, âWhat ceases to ascend, declines.ââMethought His face was troubled as he stopped me here, And answered thusââShe has no equal suitor. âThe pillows of high heads, if chaste, afford âToo narrow room for love. Spain can find out âBut few to match her children. Better live âAlone revered than coupled with the base.â DUCHESS. You are too wary, Andriaâwhile we knock, The gate is barred within. This politic wisdom Lacks boldness to perfection. PRINCE ANDRIA. Wellâit does so. I found my fault too late. You had my promise, And yet it is fulfilled in part. The king Knows all by thisâthat which I feared to speak, I wrote at large. One watchful of his humours, And near his side, marks some good hour in Spain When we are missed and mournedâhe has my letter, And will bring back its answer. So forgive me. [Exeunt. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Monastery of St. Ignazio. Savelli and Gerardo. GERARDO. It was a blessed thing to hear them speak Of Ludovico and the saint deceased, Their learning, and their wisdom, and their zeal! You should have been there tooâI never heard More wholesome doctrine. SAVELLI. May we live to profit! But tell me, does the light and straw-built duke Float toward this man of amber? GERARDO. I shall speak What wiser men have taught meâfor the duke, And the duke's nurse, my mother's eldest son, Who humbly calls me brotherâthough a god He in this firmament, and I at most A priest,âhave uttered for the two last hours These and nought else. The abbeyâas they say, Needs stricter rule: disorder like a flood, Extends and widens in our houseâmark that. The late good abbotâbe the truth itself Whispered with reverence toward his place and soulâ In age grew negligent. Hence strife, they say, Lax laws, frail discipline, perverted funds, Accounts uneven.â SAVELLI. Knew they this? GERARDO. Throughout; Nay more; for when I told them of yourselfâ How grave you were, and wise you were, adorned With holiest lettersâmeek, I said, yet bold, Laborious, watchful, pious, chaste, sincere, And framed in all to grace the choice they madeâ One pished, the other bade me peace, and both Transferred my many-coloured coat to clothe Their idol's nakedness. SAVELLI. Yet, who told this? Not Ludovico? GERARDO. Nay, no matter whoâ 'Tis told, believed, set down. The owl deceased Must have his feathers stuffed too! he shall last Embalmed for ages like the Ãgyptian bird, Worshipped and mourned by kings. 'Twere less to see My neighbour's house on fire, though next mine own, Than hear him praised or pitied. SAVELLI. He would not die A month agoâa month had saved us both. GERARDO. And this was what you call a kind good man Who loved his brethren truly! He has livedâ With all his charityâa month too long, And so may hang us both. SAVELLI. They seemed resolved? GERARDO. Faith we shall find it so. I might persuade As easily the slumbering brain and ear Of him we mourned for yesterday. Well, next I tried this tangled skein the other way, Spoke for myself a little, touched in hasteâ As men who doubt if coals be hot or noâ Mine ancient services, the treaties wrought What time they sent me on the state's affairs To Modena. SAVELLI. This was a hazardous cast. GERARDO. And so it proved, but all was lost before. SAVELLI. What did they say? GERARDO. Our pleasant duke laughed loud At such an argumentâwaxed blithe and merry, Recalled my least fair practices, and sneeredâ With much philosophy to cool his mirthâ At good Savelli's advocate. SAVELLI. The child Has learnt his lesson in his teacher's words, And speaks it like a man. GERARDO. While Andria crams This fluttering popinjay with bran for meat, The moral fragments which from age to age Wisdom lets fall, mere chips and crusts pecked up, Then dropp'd as profitlessâit eats and swells And thinks it fattens!âAndria answered nextâ âGo back, Gerardo, go. If we should seek âOne who can serve us wisely, and has hands âTo gather and distribute, drop his own, âAnd filch his neighbour'sâto apply a bribe âDiscreetly, and demurely take one backâ âHis Grace will send and find theeâbut till then, âRemember, brother, it is sometimes wise âIn some things to forget.â SAVELLI. This was to thee? GERARDO. Ay, truthâto bothâit served for both or either; The sequel ended thusââSavelli first âMust call his equals round him, show his hoard, âWhat sums he gathers for the public chest, âAnd what and how disburses.â SAVELLI. Soâthe blight Has gone abroad before me, and I reap But stubble hereâgo on. GERARDO. The younger bird Is but an innocent chick. Behold me thusâ With eyes awhile averted, diffident step Retiring, and a long scarce audible groan Half uttered half suppressedââUnmerciful man âCondemns his fellow, and a brother's tongue âWounds like the anointed sword! Is it too late âTo cast our frailties from us, and resign âEarth with its toysâto strip the body bare, âDespise its tenderness, afflict with stripes, âAnd fret the extenuate flesh with chains! The cell âShades not its habitant; but Hate and Scorn âObdurate follow;âyea, the very lips âFor whose applause we stained us, and whose smiles âFirst tempted to transgressionââ SAVELLI. Light and darkness! What didst thou hope from this? GERARDO. To make the duke Suspect us bothâmy brother and myselfâ The bulkiest lies swim best. SAVELLI. Bear witness now These cheeks of mine can blush! GERARDO. Prince Andria's too Were red, but less through modesty than wrath. âThy bribes,â he cried, âfor us! that we should smile! âI tempt thee to transgress!âThou camest, O traitor!ââ He called me traitor to my beard, and I Would risk my neck to make his words prove true; There is a settling day for him and me, But this some better timeââThou camest, O traitor! âNot penitent, not smitten in soul, not grieved âAnd wearied with offences, not as one âWho loaths and would renounce his lustsâbut driven âWith hatred at thine heels, and like a wolf âFled'st hunted to the cloister, where that head, âHid in a cowl, its crimes.âSavelli tooâ âWe know you both, Gerardo.â SAVELLI. Indeed they do? He knows us bothâwhat did he sayâus both? GERARDO. Both, man, he knows us bothâwell what of that? And both of us know him. SAVELLI. Let him say what. He shall be answered straight. The weak and base See dangers round them, and their treacherous souls Desert them in perplexity, and fail There most where most they need them. We, Gerardo, Will threat the threatener, rise as troubles rise, And grow from what would lessen. It is thus That great men prove them such. The storm blows loudly, And we will meet it with our teeth shut hard, Grinning defiance. In this world there stands But thou alone beside meâa hundred foes Hedge round, each watchful when to strike, and all Loud for the falling carcase. There are things Ill-hidden which revealed would tell sad tales! Thy brother knows us bothâwho knows how well? The mightiest are against me, and my props Fall fastâsuspicion undermines the rest Which stay me yetâill-credit presses hard, The public coffers in my charge abused, And worse than empty, for the notes are there Which tell their obligations! Thou and I Have borrowed largely of their wealth, and now No crown to payâbut mark, Gerardo, still I will be abbot ere the duke is king, And we shall prosper. GERARDO. Some one comes this way. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. An Apartment in the Palace. Duke, Duchess, and Prince of Andria. PRINCE ANDRIA. We have not seen Arezzi. DUCHESS. He of late Has kept too much from home. PRINCE ANDRIA. I know his haunts, And should be better pleased to find his choice Were wiser in his friends. DUCHESS. Who? this Cimbelli? PRINCE ANDRIA. O he! I meant not him. DUKE. What is he? PRINCE ANDRIA. He is A whelp too loud for mischief, yet they say True bredâhe left us babbling for a drum, Took sides with Venice, and while heads with brains Were burst by scores, his own ill-soldered pateâ Though ever thrust the foremost toward mischanceâ Came safely back. There is another near, For choosing whom I mainly blame myself. DUKE. He that was late his tutor? PRINCE ANDRIA. I should blush To own how much the learning of that monk, His reverend carriage, and most eloquent speech, Prevailed with one so wary. Pious, he seemed, Discreet and mortifiedâhis clear cool eye Baffled my watchfulness. DUKE. You have heard more? PRINCE ANDRIA. Not yetâI dig, but cannot reach the root, And therefore I suspect him. Meaner reptiles Crawl to their mischief fearfully, and leave Snail-like their slime to trace them where they goâ This worm seems native to the fruit he gnaws, Engendered in the blossom. DUCHESS. Well, but why Thus level at the friar? we must not hope That Naples hides no fellow knave to this, As wise and secret as he is. PRINCE ANDRIA. Your Grace Sees that my threads are fine, but will not mark How many run one way. First, then, we have it That plots affect the stateâwe know who meet, For what, and whereâwe have a voice among them, Our seat is in their closetâwhen we choose We can lay hold on these. DUKE. Then why not, now? PRINCE ANDRIA. Good saints! not now. Your highness does forgetâ These stand for little else than sticks or stones To break our heads. I watch the hand which throws, And leave the pebble where it lies. We know That Naples swarms with treasonsâleagues there are Where traitors seek a breathing place for spleen, Banded by tens and twelves. Each makes a whole, Has signs and countersigns, its laws and leaders,â A dwarfish state full grown. Though pledged and sworn, None knows its own confederatesâbut apart Obeys some mightier despot, who retired Rules by his ministers, and holds unseen Mysterious monarchy o'er all. DUCHESS. And so, Bound by their sacraments, two friends or kinsmen Might both be disciplined in several schools, Nor one suspect the other? PRINCE ANDRIA. Even thusâand here The law stands shamed and baffledâbid it on, It can but crush a fragment of the whole, And leave the rest more wise. DUKE. Well, now this monk. PRINCE ANDRIA. Next, then, for this Savelli. He has held His abbey's purse for years, justly, men think, At first, more loosely after, by degrees Wide open to his lusts. A house so large Has eyes to spareâand some have watched the friar. Hence whisperings, not of thriftlessness and sloth, Idle misuse, with prodigal palm toward all, Large and profuse yet equalâbut of waste Luxurious, selfish, secret, and extreme. Ask him for gold long due; it is a day Too late, or else too earlyâthen the charge Breeds doubts and cavilsâhe must find it just, And you, the while, must wait. He makes new friends Matched badly with his years, his studies, callingâ And those who least love us. Ill men like him Must put their necks in jeopardy perforce To bail their headsâas drunkards stand the best When most unsteadily. DUCHESS. This sheep, Arezzi, Hath never dreamed his shepherd may turn knave, But follows pure of heart. DUKE. Then let us warn him. PRINCE ANDRIA. That were to warn them both. I do suspect An elder member of our house, a branch Which rotten as it is, is oursâa wart Set on our honor's noseâa scurf in the blood To crust our pride with leprosy! I fear Gerardo, not Arezzi. DUCHESS. Well, at night We shall have time to question this again. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. A Walk near the Sea. Arezzi, Cimbelli, and Castro. CIMBELLI. We meet at sunset where we supped last night? AREZZI. I speak for oneânot I. CASTRO. Nor I. CIMBELLI. How nowâ This lover of the moonshine, let him go And tune his luteâbut you, a man of war! What, was the wine too weak? CASTRO. Good wine, good supper, And pleasant guests, Cimbelli. CIMBELLI. What would'st more? CASTRO. The spice alone which seasoned this good feast, Was not so good. CIMBELLI. You do not like my friends? Come speak it plainly. CASTRO. On my life, I doâ Them, and the things they like. There are in Rome Who worship with the self same faith, and make Their vows to Freedom tooâbut I came here A stranger idly tired of home and ease, No spy, no meddlerâand would keep my head To guide me back again. Now those we speak of Set light by theirsâthey talk about the state, I will not say unwisely, but too freely. AREZZI. Bothâsirâand you may add to both, untruly. CIMBELLI. Bah! you mistake them, Castro: they speak out Like true and honest men. Cat's soup! too freely! Why so? how speak these freedom-loving Romans? CASTRO. With strangersânot at all. CIMBELLI. What strangers? who? Yourself and this Arezzi here? for one, I told them what he isâa staunch staid man, Honest, at least, and whether right or wrong, No turn-aboutâwho hates all sorts of changing, Even to his shirtâwhose reverend visage seems Fashioned three thousand years, or more, agoâ The shell of some philosopher's stray soul Gone to fill out a bear. CASTRO. This stands for me! CIMBELLI. Right, by Diana's brotherâhe it was Who bade us know ourselves. The other tooâ Ye amorous gales breathe softly where he strays, And draw your odours from his sighs! Ye flowers Yield to the purple languor of his cheeks Suffused with tears! what can be known of him, Creature so fine, impalpable as heâ A lunar rainbow's watergall in Aprilâ They knew before. AREZZI. What did they know, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. Why, that the dukeâHeaven shield him! takes your love, The prince your moneyâCupid has your brains, And I your company. CASTRO. Count, if this be true, Cimbelli's benediction on your friends, May pass without Amen. CIMBELLI. 'Tis done in mercy! The grosser cares of wedlock, wealth, and eating, So are removed. He lives a spiritual count, Touched by no earthly sympathiesâabove The thoughts of meat and drink, or coat and waistcoat. What rich man married ever wrote a sonnet? CASTRO. Why true. CIMBELLI. And yet he murmurs! they who tell His tale hereafter, will begin with words To caution the ungrateful. It would make Rare ballad-warning for rebellious youth, Set to a sorrowful tune, well vouched at top With rueful visage from some wood-wrought print, And superscribed Arezzi. CASTRO. May I hear it? AREZZI. I care notâas you pleaseâbut take this with itâ Our earliest politicians hint abroad That Punch grows old and sickâNaples, they fear, May lose its oracle: now we would gain The office by reversion for your friend: He has some fruitful qualities, and lacks Scarce one, but witâwell practiseâsirâbegin. CIMBELLI. Sit down thenâshall I sing?ââLo! this is he âWhose parents dear are dolphins in the sea. âThey loved and they married, but the maid âHad kinsmen hard of heart, and so she fled. âThey went far off by nightânew names they got, âNo matter whence, and now, no matter what. âAt Pisa did they rest awhile, and there âThis babe was bornââ AREZZI. His feet have slipt the stirrupsâ What else? CASTRO. This spoils his rhyme. AREZZI. No matter now: Better go on withoutâyet Heaven can tell If I have ever thought my fate a jest, Though I might scorn to weep at it. CASTRO. There is With some mens' bitterness, a spirit like mirth, And such, it seems, has yours. But I presume A self-invited guest, and ill-advised Have thrust me rashly on a stranger's patience: Yet more in ignorance than want of shame, And less through will, than chance. AREZZI. It is a tale Which strangers know this, sir, offends and grieves me, That still we should be such. Wellânow the poetâ Come, mount again, and forward. CIMBELLI. Tell the rest Thyself!âthe muse disdains thee for her theme, And so thy name shall perish. AREZZI. Peace, then, parrot. CASTRO. Pray let him end this sing-song as he can. AREZZI. He could but tell you that it is my chance To be an orphan twice. For those two lost, Two more were found as kindâyet love in error Is sometimes worse than hate. They should have matched My thoughts and fortunesâbut they laughed or winked at What must be mourned for nowâthose dangerous fires Easiest enkindled in the spirit of youth, Whose oils and odours feed them half life throughâ Or quenched at first, or neverâpride, ambition, With lonely thoughts, and wishes not impure, But wildâ CIMBELLI. Love, and Love's dÃ¦mon, Jealousy! AREZZI. These they held lightly thenâand then at once Turned round, saw nothing right, reproved that pride, Put chains on that ambition, made home sad, Checked late-allowed expense, gave gold by bits, And cast the shadow of their frowns between The heart and its affections. CIMBELLI. This means courtshipâ A timorous sort of paraphrase! and so Sir Mouse must hide him while sir Monkey woosâ Yield to his betters there! The duke in love May bid the count stand backânayânot too far, Not out of calling, neither. They will want A brideman for the groom. âWhat shall I doâgive counsel, love, and say âWhat I shall do! is it not time to die? âLong have I tarried here, I know not whyâ âAnd still deferr'd the thing from day to dayâ âLived on, if this be living.â AREZZI. I may not take My sword and find a home elsewhere. CIMBELLI. Well, wellâ Good night, go both to bedâhe is untrue Who says that tyrannous deeds are done by tyrantsâ And so no supper! CASTRO. Stay manâfor myself, I care not where I go. AREZZI. Nor I, Cimbelli, Lead to the moon, I follow. CIMBELLI. To the moon? By old Astolfo's hippogriff and horn, And your lost wits, I yield the guidance thereâ You know the road the best. Arezzi's greatness, His villas, servants, treasures, tenants, farms, Wine, household stuff, books, statues, pictures, horses, And wardrobe, save a silken suit of black, His wife herself, and five of his own senses, Are all up there. [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Monastery at night. Savelli and Gerardo. GERARDO. Thou wilt be abbot, ere the duke is king? Good newsâbut how? SAVELLI. The words stick hard, Gerardoâ By that which answers for us both, manâpower. GERARDO. We talk in riddles. SAVELLI. First, expound me this; âHe called me traitor to my beard, and I âWould risk my neck to make his words prove true.â GERARDO. 'Twas mine of Andria. SAVELLI. Let us both repent; Each has been loud in folly. GERARDO. What I said I hold by stillâthou dost distrust me, brother. SAVELLI. I do. GERARDO. Indeed! it is unjustly then. SAVELLI. But wisely nevertheless. I have my scruples, Or elseâ GERARDO. Else what? SAVELLI. I could suggest a thing Fit for vexed hearts like ours, great as our need, Bold as our wishes, easier than our fears, Less dangerous than our present state. GERARDO. What is it? Tell me what sort of thing? SAVELLI. Why, such an one As twice has given the world to those who did it, And ten times, crown and thrones. The wisest risk All lesser things for thisâto us, Gerardo, Success were empireâif we failed, defeat Could only leave us where we are. GERARDO. Come, come, Dost think I would betray thee? SAVELLI. Indeed I fear it. GERARDO. No, by my faith, believe me. SAVELLI. I pray thee, give A mortgage on thy land as well, transfer Thy rents and lordships. Twenty years ago That faith was lost at Milan, pledged again In Venice, Florence, Modenaâand since Full twenty times a year, with twenty oaths, To twenty men at least. GERARDO. And twenty womenâ But what is that to thee? SAVELLI. Why, marryâ'tis much. I do not like the bondâhast nothing else? GERARDO. Our friendship, then, Savelli. SAVELLI. Thou would'st sell it Some Friday morn in Lent to buy an eggâ I will be better conjured yet. GERARDO. Well, hearâ By all my services. SAVELLI. They must be, then, The services to come. This charm is stronger, And shall prevail. GERARDO. Be honest with me, brother. SAVELLI. Give me thine handâso now I would not change thee For Maia's child by Jupiter, or takeâ Winged as he isâtheir servant from the gods. Ye both are covetous though poor, expert In fraud and falsehood; patrons both to knaves; Furnished with twofold faces, fair in the light, In darkness terribleâand your office is To guide stray souls below. GERARDO. I wish it were, So thy turn came the next. My mind is changed, I will not hear thy secretâmay it choke thee! SAVELLI. Why, you have owned all this. GERARDO. Then let it rest, What need to speak it twice? SAVELLI. To try the baby! Art fit to travail midst the clouds with me, And slant their lightnings at the heads of kings? Thou petulant splenetic ape! a lighted reed Can make the caldron of thy bile run o'er, Ever brimfull and boiling! thou that hast gained The wisdom to discern men's thoughts, a tongue Skilled to persuade and charm, a heart withal Untrammell'd by remorseâwhy these, all these Are worse than barren, for they yield thee still Disgrace and poverty. GERARDO. Well, let it be soâ What thou hast more say on. SAVELLI. The spirit which leads thee Provokes disasterâthou dost ever look Beside, or else beyond thine aim, and thus No arrow strikes. GERARDO. I was a god till now, Your Joveship's Mercury. SAVELLI. Thou hast still, Gerardo, Wings plumed to reach the skies, a power within Which should uplift its owner from the crowd, And place him on his pedestal so high That all might see and worship. What I fear Is less than treachery, though as badâby fraud Thou canst not harm me, or I would not trust thee. GERARDO. Either may hang the other. SAVELLI. Art sure of that? Then study to be first. We have been friends, The night has heard and hidden what day would blush at; Strong wine has exorcised the ghost of fearâ Yet, in our mirth, there was a hand above thee, Naples herself is slumbering in its shade. GERARDO. If I might ever fearâit should be thee, I know, but do not yet. SAVELLI. Lookâhe who knows me, Lives while he serves meâlet his heart rebel,â And arm or hide him as he may, my wrath Shall pluck it out. GERARDO. Thou canst do this? SAVELLI. Why, thus Valerio doubted if I couldâhe held The place which thou dost now. GERARDO. Valerio! mercy! Thou didst not murder him? SAVELLI. He did betray me. GERARDO. By all those stars, I never dreamed of this! He seemed a son, a servant. SAVELLI. He forgot That sons and servants should obeyâso now Awake and gaze. We both have ventured forth, And o'er this perilous sea, whose breezes swell To storms at last, nor ever change toward shore, Our boat has drifted easily alongâ But in so small a crew, one should have brains. Thou, while the feast seems good, dost eat and drink Despite the reckoningâI have cares for that: Thou, while the abbey's purse shrank daily less, Didst trust what I did not. GERARDO. Brother, it was The common trust of both to raise and place thee Where none dare mark its emptiness. SAVELLI. It was My hope, my trust was better placed elsewhere. GERARDO. In what? SAVELLI. Dominion, wider than these walls, Power, taken as the right of all who gain it, The crowning gift of Nature where she loves. I must not govern in a house like this, So now to leave the crosier for a sword, And climb up higher! This plethorick city groans With lust and vanity: we have around us The vintage of long peace o'er ripeâcontempt And splenetic restlessness, a critical tongue, Hatred toward Spain, ambition ill-employed, Unhonored wealth, and luxury unfedâ Large debts, much pride, licentious wants, and wishes Which will find means. Here many, like ourselves, Can stay no longer what they are, and some, Though well, must change. There are of every sortâ Zealots, who build the churches' roof to Heaven, Saints, who would lower and cleanse itâAtheists too Who can endure no master in the skies, Yet worship one unseen, and will obey They know not whomâmyself. I class apart The proud, the base, the idleânot one man Can see beyond his tribe; and, out of all, Thou only knowest who rules them. GERARDO. Take my soul With all its services! A place like this Is level with my hopes. SAVELLI. We have enough To strike the unguarded down, but after that, Shall want a better face to meet the sun. Some brave there are, some nobleânone renownedâ The people love old names; to those who change Opinion strengthens force. The Count Arezzi Is loved, and might do much. GERARDO. The Count Arezzi! My brother's ward! SAVELLI. Even suchâbut then he was Savelli's pupilâhe hath studied that Which mars this guardianship. His friend Cimbelli Is with us body and soul; we two must strive To catch the Count. Now let us partâgood night. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Chamber in the Palace. Prince of Andria and Arezzi. PRINCE ANDRIA. I cannot ask it of the duke, Arezzi. AREZZI. Your highness judges best. PRINCE ANDRIA. I have good reasons. AREZZI. No doubt you have. PRINCE ANDRIA. No doubt!âthen why require it? AREZZI. I knew not that you had till now. PRINCE ANDRIA. But still You scarce believe me. AREZZI. I will press my suit No farther on your highnessâwhat I asked Was not to serve myself. PRINCE ANDRIA. Savelli sent you? AREZZI. I would not injure where I cannot help: This is not much to crave. I pray your highness Forget that it was I who named the friar, And then his suit may prosper. PRINCE ANDRIA. How, Arezzi? Why so, why so? AREZZI. My task is irksome to me. PRINCE ANDRIA. What task? AREZZI. To seek a kindness here. I lose All credit, and with all. Who sent me to you And saw how tardily I came, have blamed My coldness toward my friendsâyour highness blames me Because I sued too warmlyâI blame myself That I could sue at all. PRINCE ANDRIA. Come back, Arezziâ What dreams are these? I tell thee twice I cannot, And more, I will not ask it. AREZZI. Nay, my lord, I learnt so much at first. PRINCE ANDRIA. So much? how now? AREZZI. I give offence; your highness will excuse meâ PRINCE ANDRIA. Come back, I sayâbeware of this Savelliâ Mark what you hear, young man. AREZZI. Savelli once Was valued by your highness, you have praised His learning loudlyâfor myself, I gained The little that I have through himâin all I lack, I blame myself. PRINCE ANDRIA. I know not which, But one forgot his business, he to teachâ Or you to learnâobedience. AREZZI. Both perhaps, Thought that the task were needless, since your Grace Taught it so oft yourself. PRINCE ANDRIA. Well, Heaven be praised! Old men may yet find leisure to grow wise! Our children will instruct us. Bacchus' smooth lip Shall chide Olympus with its bearded gods, Scatter blessed wisdom in the ears of Jove, And school the bald Silenus!âBabes can tell How best to rule the state, what each man merits, Whose heads should wear our mitres, who should share Our abbeys, fill our offices, and help To guide us in our counsels! [Enter the Duke and Duchess. DUKE. Chiding, cousin? I thought to chide myself. Arezzi here, The last to bid us welcome! AREZZI. But your Grace Sees that I come too early as it is. DUKE. I hope not soâwe will make peace between you. What was it that his highness said? AREZZI. He said That fools intrude, and children meddle rashly; That babes would rule the state, and nurslings, men; That scalps with hair, and chins withoutâlike oursâ Wag at grey beards and baldness. Then the prince Compared himself to Jove, and us to Bacchus.â Your Grace's subjects, when your Grace is king, Must pray that Jove will grant your Grace a beard, And govern till it comeâI say, Amen. [Exit. DUKE. What children meddle? Andria call him back. PRINCE ANDRIA. Come back, Arezzi. DUCHESS. Better let him go. PRINCE ANDRIA. Your Grace shall hearâO, this would sweat a flintâ A saint in marble!âBlockhead! he came here To plead for that SavelliâI refused, Said that I would not name it to your Graceâ DUCHESS. Well, well, we will forget him now, it seems Your arrow pierced the bush, and grazed them both, But least the bird you aimed at. Tell us next What more of this Savelli? PRINCE ANDRIA. Plagues go with him! I lay the whole to him. I do believe That he perverts this coxcomb. He has shown His teeth before the timeâhe will not hurt us! Eyes, nearer than he dreams of, watch the friar, And let me once lay hold, that plausible tongue May fail to beg its head. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Street. Three Citizens. FIRST CITIZEN. Stand near me then, I will be first to speak, And you must further what I sayâit is Too perilous for a single tongue, though true, But safe divided. SECOND CITIZEN. We must beg our own, And that with fear. FIRST CITIZEN. These friars are not like us; They are the boldest when alone, together They may be shamed or scared. THIRD CITIZEN. It were a sin To do as many do, when one man hurts them, Strike all his fellows for his faultâI know Much good among these monks. FIRST CITIZEN. Come, take your places, The crowd draws near. SECOND CITIZEN. As there is truth in Heaven, The abbey owes me for its last year's breadâ I have not seen one crown. THIRD CITIZEN. My patience lived As long again as yours. SECOND CITIZEN. This treasurer singsâ But not so sweetlyâlike his abbey's chimes, Seven different tunes a week: if words were silver, He would have paid me threefold. FIRST CITIZEN. Thou dost get A word as something then: he will not pay Even that to me, but flatly braves my threatenings, Forgets his signature, abjures the debt, And drives me out. THIRD CITIZEN. Some think he will be abbot. FIRST CITIZEN. Nay, God forbid! THIRD CITIZEN. The one they mourn to-day Was meek and gracious, he has heard me speak, But said he could not help me. SECOND CITIZEN. He was old; The treasurer grew too strong for years and meekness, And ruled a better man. THIRD CITIZEN. In what we do, This single scruple chafes meâit may seem Irreverent toward the good man's worth, that so We meet his bones. SECOND CITIZEN. Neighbour, no more, I pray theeâ We do what has been done before to-dayâ Look! here he comes. FIRST CITIZEN. Be ready at my sideâ He marches with the first; come on, and face him. THIRD CITIZEN. Wait till their chaunt is endedâpeace, sirs, hush! We must not speak till then. A Funeral Processionâthe Dominican Monks enter two and two, bearing torches and singing. Savelli, Gerardo, Ludovico, and Others. Hymn. Ye mighty leave the painted dome, Ye poor and meek that houseless roamâ Come, tread the path which leads you home, And none can shun or miss: Strength, wisdom, reverence, wealth, and bliss, Ambition's honors, Beauty's kiss, Whatever is must come to this, Whatever was is come. Though breath is vapour, flesh is dust, They never die who love and trustâ Life only slumbers with the just To wake and rise again: Mourn ye the sinful and the vain, The wandering heart, and toil-sick brainâ Who sleeps in faith is hushed from painâ But wake and rise he must. FIRST CITIZEN. Heaven grant its mercy to the deadâthe living Ask of its servants justice. SAVELLI. What are these? Stand back there drunkardsâlet the bier pass onâ Who clears our way? FIRST CITIZEN. You know us, what we areâ THIRD CITIZEN. And that we are not drunk. SECOND CITIZEN. You have not left us Enough for gluttony. LUDOVICO. Be patient, brethren; We do beseech your peace for love of him Whose soul requires our prayers. SECOND CITIZEN. You should remember How long we have been patient. LUDOVICO. What I ask Is less than charity. SAVELLI. Brother ask nothingâ The church shall take her own. FIRST CITIZEN. Sirsâwe have stood With daily beggars at the abbey gate, To crave, not alms, but duesâthe treasurer knows it. SAVELLI. What sort of dues they were, I knowâhow patched And lined with fraud. There are, beside mine own, Lips which shall witness this. FIRST CITIZEN. They must be false ones. GERARDO. Take heed! take heed! It is a sin to use The weight and balance of deceit, and earn Our bread by perjuriesâbut worse it is To lie against a holier brother's truth, And wrong the just. I testify these frauds, Who helped to search them. FIRST CITIZEN. Thou? GERARDO. Ay, Iâand who Is he that questions me? THIRD CITIZEN. Beware this manâ He is the prince's brother.â SAVELLI. They do it to bring A scandal on the church and us. GERARDO. Good people If any honor God, and love mens' souls, Or mourn the just deceasedâdrive out these scorners, Smite them, but shed no blood; be patient with them. SECOND CITIZEN. Hear me one word.â SAVELLI. Stand back, I sayâwill none Remove them hence?ânow bring the corpse along. Exeunt with the procession. CROWD. Shame! shame! lay hold upon these knaves. FIRST CITIZEN. But first Hear what we have to speak. CROWD. It is a sin! Most impious sacrilege! THIRD CITIZEN. Grant me one word. SOME OF THE CROWD. Neighbours, stand still awhileâthese men are honest, And known to many here. CROWD. Be quiet and hear them! OTHERS. We know all three. FIRST CITIZEN. We shall desire but this, That you will choose the gravest from yourselvesâ Some six or seven of whom you will, to spend An hour at home with us, where we will prove More than we yet have spoken, or else confess Our malice is of Hell. CROWD. It is well said! Come on, then,âwe will find good menâaway. Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Chamber in the Palace. The Duke, Don Gabriel Lucerna, and Don Florez Zava. DUKE. You never loved him much. DON GABRIEL. Nor had much cause: He never loved your Grace. DUKE. I think he did: At least he seemed to do so. DON GABRIEL. Ayâhe seemedâ Were all men what they seem!â DUKE. Arezzi isâ We must speak justly, Gabriel.â DON GABRIEL. Heaven forbid That I should question what he is. I speak More from my blood than brainâit is my nature. I cannot do as some much wiser men, Who wink on both sides slily; shake by the hand Their patron's slanderer; listen with meek smiles To all, and neutral 'twixt the wronged and wrongerâ Wish that they could be friendsâI cannot do it, And what is worse, I cannot strive to do it. My soul is with my serviceâWhere your Grace Loves, I love tooâand where you hate, I hate. DUKE. Wellâwellâthen love, Arezziâlearn to hate When I know how to teach you. By my hopes Now and to come, I would not harm the countâ No, not in thought, for worlds! DON FLOREZ. He wrongs your highness In more than thoughtâin deed. DON GABRIEL. He thinks it safer To pluck the beard of Jove, than touch one hair Worn by Jove's priests. Your highness has a sword Too sacred for the use of private strifeâ And this he knows. DON FLOREZ. Hush! hush!âwe must not say so. DON GABRIEL. Pasquin usurps the privilege to speak, And he may mock the pope.âA boy! a meddler! A child too young for love!âand he, forsooth, Just old enough!âDon Florez, for ourselves, We too will learn the thrift of such a trade, And purchase love with scorn. DON FLOREZ. The price for honor Once, was obedience. DON GABRIEL. Blockheads as we are, We pay it still. DUKE. And so shall he, and all. What profit has he made him yet from scorn? How does it grace him, Gabriel?âcomeâno more. [Exeunt. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Palace. Duchess, Prince of Andria and Cimbelli. PRINCE ANDRIA. Where does he pass his hours? DUCHESS. And how, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. Why many in the sunshine on the shore, Where walls once stood, and weeds and briars aboundâ Wherever there is room to sit and sigh in; Where ivy roots itself on banks and stones; Where he can watch the lizards.âFor the howâ In plucking up those weeds, and from those stones, In stripping off that ivy. He will mark Some beetle's wanderings till the sun goes down, From noon; has skill in reptilesâknows throughout The courtships of a cockchafer. DUCHESS. And you Are fellow to his studies? CIMBELLI. Yes, sometimes. PRINCE ANDRIA. Then tell us what you learn. CIMBELLI. That young men's eyes, Like old ones' spectacles of green or yellow, Give color to the things they see, but take Their virtues from their fancies. PRINCE ANDRIA. Well. CIMBELLI. The Count Doubts if the swarms of earth be blessed or no, And moralizes mournfully on moths. PRINCE ANDRIA. And you? CIMBELLI. I love their Iris-tinted wings And giddy circles; other tribes I see Warlike and full of pride, from head to heel Bright in their burnished panoplyâand think That all God's creatures should be blessed. Arezzi Sits like a sea-bird on some rock retired, Eyeing the watersâFancy helps his sight To sound their depths and reach all sorrowful things.â There rots the gilded argosy, and near, Scattered with weeds and shells, some mariner's bones, For ever fretted with the restless tide. He sees the ring priest-blessed, or young Love's token Unhappy and unhallowed, like his own. PRINCE ANDRIA. And prithee what see you? CIMBELLI. My thoughts the while Sport gaily in their amorous musings, pleased To pave the coral grots with pearls, and light Their jasper roofs with naphtha. From below Some green-eyed mermaid sees meâwhen I smile, She smiles, and combs the tresses from her brow: Timorous and coy, yet captive to my prayers. I make me friends of tritons: I can findâ Wrecked in the sands full three score years agoâ Huge butts of delicate wine. The dolphins tell The marvels of the oceanâwhile they sing, I teach my merry orks to drinkâyour Grace Believes that there be mermaids? DUCHESS. Well, what then? CIMBELLI. Why then the rest is easier to believe. DUCHESS. And thus his hours run wastefully! CIMBELLI. Even thusâ Nay, sometimes worse. DUCHESS. How worse? I hope not worse? CIMBELLI. Believe me, so. PRINCE ANDRIA. Speak plainly. CIMBELLI. He will sit Fixed like some pondering river god in stone, All but the beardâNarcissus sick at heart, Or garden Pan regardless. I can tell The hours, as on a dial, by his shade, His nose the gnomon.âThis is worseâto wait Undined the while he muses. DUCHESS. You should speak Good counsel to his too much thought. CIMBELLI. I do. PRINCE ANDRIA. What is it then? CIMBELLI. I tell him he has lost The princess and her love, the duke's love too,â Whose stray loves meet, and live in love togetherâ The favor of her highness; that your Grace Is little satisfied withal; that soonâ As sequent to the fashion of these lossesâ He must lose me. PRINCE ANDRIA. So, comfort comes at last! And now what more? CIMBELLI. That moneyless means witless, And parting kindness leaves its room to hate. That better had it been to live a beggar, Borrowing his blushes while he lies for bread, Than born in nobleness, feel pride a hindrance, And blush indeed to beg. He must have hidden Some sin from all besideâsome pestilent sin Which cleaves unto him still; for never yet Did one so young and lovely lose such friends, Unless his youth were blistered by disgrace, Remorse or baseness tainted it, his lips Were perjured at the altarâhe had earned The name of cowardâtraitor! DUCHESS. Traitor! villain? Away thou ill-tongued idiot. PRINCE ANDRIA. Get thee forth. CIMBELLI. I pray your highness hearâ DUCHESS. Arezzi's friend! His name was never whispered with distaste, Till paired with thineâCimbelli! CIMBELLI. Yet, your Graceâ DUCHESS. Thou vapour from some sewer! what, perjured too! A coward perjured! That vile scalp were honor'd To keep the pavement chillness from his feet.â Who waits without? PRINCE ANDRIA. Go, babble somewhere else. [Exit Cimbelli. Come, patience, hush! DUCHESS. Andria, I have been patient, But will not listen to a slave like this. PRINCE ANDRIA. You did not understand him,âfool, or no, His trap has caught your Grace. DUCHESS. And, liar or no, Part that he said was truthâwe wrong Arezzi, And teach the rest to wrong him. PRINCE ANDRIA. O, God forbid! DUCHESS. What others think, this speaks. Who love us best Are last to judge; we change us by the moon; Shut goodness out; make taverns of our hearts, Where innocence tarries but a night, and leaves Its room for some worse guest. What has he done, That all should thus forsake him? PRINCE ANDRIA. But who forsakes him? Is it not he that flies? DUCHESS. And why? PRINCE ANDRIA. Because We wisely hold our tongues. DUCHESS. Alas! this wisdom! Our loathed old policy! while his caged spirit Flutters tormented with its pains and fears, We scowl the remnant of its hopes away, And rob it of the light we gave. PRINCE ANDRIA. But hear meâ What have we else to do? DUCHESS. Speak outâand boldly Claim our poor child as ours. PRINCE ANDRIA. Well, let it be so. My policy was not for me, but both. We will not wait our answer, then, from Spain, But bravely spurn the policy you hate, And show our rings at once. ContentâI care not! So nowâwhat are we? first Arezzi's parents, Cicilia's kindred, guardians of the duke, The king's true counsellorsâyea, we do wisely To bawl our history first in beggars' ears, Make the Toledo ring with it; fill full The squares, the quays, the markets, and the mole,â Naples through all its taverns, cloisters, stalls, From caverned wine vat, to the chimnies' topâ With wonder at this rarityâand next Whisper our secret to the king; good nowâ This is indeed to strain at policy! While patience for a week may smooth the whole, And set us right with all. DUCHESS. Do as you will. PRINCE ANDRIA. Nay, by the holy saints! it is my will To wrestle with my wisdomâwhat we do Is your will, and so mine. DUCHESS. Thus it is everâ I have my will, it seems, and you your way. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. A Public Walk. Arezzi and Savelli. SAVELLI. Well wellâand so it isâwe must forgiveâ But when? how speaks that law you cite me? In wisdom truly! all its ends are such: Beware lest ignorance read the text amiss!â To see the injurious on their knees, and then Remit the injuryâthis were to make The weeds which nature scatters in mens' hearts, A growth for Heaven! Our passions thus seem holy, Their human crudities purged off, and love Infused insteadâbut look, young man, the end Must still be mercy. AREZZI. We reclaim our own From force by force. SAVELLI. You might have saidâfrom wrong By stronger right. Spain hath oppressed us, robb'd us, And would devour us if she could. AREZZI. The prince Has guarded what I prize not much, but still Must owe to him. SAVELLI. Your life? then give him back What he does value much, his ownâand thus Pay all, with usury. But good, my son, You must be master of it first. Who now? AREZZI. It is the monk his brother. SAVELLI. Who? Gerardo? Hush! thenâbe waryânever trust that man. [Enter Gerardo. GERARDO. Good thoughts to both. SAVELLI. With such a sparkling face There should be such a welcomeâtell us next, What news, and whence? All men must smile who hear them. GERARDO. 'Twere treason to look grave: my kinsman here Will find them old. AREZZI. If goodâbelieve meâno. GERARDO. Yourselves must judge of thatâthey came last night Whence goodness ever comes, from Spain. The king Resigns us to his son.âContent to keep But half of this poor world, he yields two thronesâ Two of its oldest, to the duke, who reigns An infant Jove. He will be married first, Then crowned forthwith. SAVELLI. Married! to whom? GERARDO. His cousin. Nay this, at least, is old enough. Men wished An empress like Cicilia. SAVELLI. Here, at length His fortune is summ'd upâon this side Heaven There is no more to grant him. GERARDO. Let me confessâ Now that remembrance is the last sin left meâ Could youth with secular thoughts returnâand one, The princess, or the crown, with choice of which, Be given myself, I should think either much, But take the first. She looks a queen already; I saw her at the window by his side, Blush like Athena ere she stripp'd to Paris; And mingle in her glance of love, the awe Which chastens majestyâher cheeks appeared Offended at her eyes. SAVELLI. Arezzi! GERARDO. Count! See how he reels! lay holdâhow white he is! Art sick, man, speak? Savelli! mercy on us! Thus early drunk? fie! fie! SAVELLI. It is the weather. Brother let loose. GERARDO. He freshens nowâHeaven bless us! Prithee stand upâhast legs, good cousin, or no? SAVELLI. Arezzi! speak. GERARDO. Where did he dine to day? AREZZI. Prayâprayâstand back. GERARDO. Thou shalt sleep off this surfeit; A little rest in bed. SAVELLI. Comeâlean on us. AREZZI. What did Gerardo say? SAVELLI. Peace, son, no matterâ We both will see thee hence. AREZZI. The day is hot, But now I am myself againâgood fatherâ When will the duke be crowned? GERARDO. I know not whenâ He will be married first, they say. SAVELLI. Well, well, Some better time for that. GERARDO. The prince my brother Will sadden when he hears of thisâto-day He seemed himself the bridegroom, such a coupling Is master policy! Hast ever felt These qualms before? AREZZI. Sometimesâbut now, adieu! SAVELLI. We must not leave you here. GERARDO. Come, walk with us. In faith, you startled me. AREZZI. I want no helpâ Savelli, we will meet to-morrow at noon. GERARDO. What! wouldst be left alone? we will not leave thee, Sweet charity! to swoon againâperhaps die! Take one, or both. AREZZI. Pray get thee hence, once more. GERARDO. It is not safe, nor will we go. AREZZI. Awayâ This drives me mad. GERARDO. The greater need, good cousin, Of care in us. AREZZI. Stand off, thou meddling knaveâ Get back to Modenaâthe gallows there Is nearer kin than I. SAVELLI. Let loose, Gerardo. [Exit Arezzi. GERARDO. With all my heart! Master was this done well? Ah! ah! sir BounceâOrlando in his teens! Behold the potency of two dark eyes! How speedily the carp grew sick! a hair Will draw your lover on his back to landâ The hook is in his gills; and if we lose him, He yet may rise again. Come, thank me, praise me; Have I done well, or no? SAVELLI. Bravelyâbut yet Too much beyond your book. Where didst pick up Those news from Spain? GERARDO. I found them by the way As truths, and took them to adorn our fable. SAVELLI. Indeed! art sure? GERARDO. We have a ship from Spain, And such a rumour with it. SAVELLI. Thou mightier Ãsop! He made his fables to adorn some truth; If thou art ever honest, it must be To grace or hide some lie. Now, I will call thee My son and heir. GERARDO. There is another heirship The which I covet moreâif we shall thrive, Promise me that beside. SAVELLI. What is it? I will. GERARDO. First, chide me not for asking thee, but think If what I say be so. Of living things All have their several wants and properties, As great presiding nature grants to eachâ So lambs are meek, dogs watchful, leopards fierce; The vulture hath his taste, though not a pure one; The wasp or asp is guiltless while it stings, And, if we slay, we blame it not. In men There are your lambs and leopards, asps and owlsâ Now that which follows instinct seconds nature; So he who strives with nature, is unnaturalâ And such, we know, is sin. Apply we this. My instinct moves me to abhor what hurts me; And there is one, who, five and forty years, Casting his shade upon my growth, has kept Both grace and fortune off. SAVELLI. The prince of Andria? These moral reasonings ever point one way! GERARDO. Andria must go to bliss, and quickly too. You shall hear reasons why he mustâIt is Nor you, nor I,âbut wisdom, justice, safety, The public wealâwhich sends him there. His breath Would blow our new-built house about our earsâ So we must stop it. SAVELLI. Those who love him not, Yet think his instinct is averse from thine, And looks toward truth. GERARDO. The better fit to die! An upright man withal! full of good deeds, Blessed in his many charities; and thus He ever has been. I stand next as heir, But that he loves me not, and this sick cousinâ Who talked of Modena, and named the gallowsâ Pushes himself between. That which I covet Is plainly mine by right. The jealous Count Must either take my substance, or depart And leave me hisânow judge between us fairly. SAVELLI. Wouldst send him too, Gerardo? GERARDO. He called me knave, Prince Andria called me traitorâI would strive To render back such courtesies as these. Who taught the boy Arezzi what I was? Prince Andria taught him. And that younger child, Whence did he learn to gird me thus, last night? From Andria tooâmy loving brother Andriaâ That leaped some months before me to the sun, Became my gracious prince, mine elder brother; Set me at buffets with the world, and when I played not quite so fairly, first cried shame!â Thwarted my hopes, drove me from court and office, And made me what I am. He reared this babe To vex and rob me; and my father's land Must feed an alien. SAVELLI. We will think on this. GERARDO. As prince, I may be useful to the state. SAVELLI. But, then, thy vows! GERARDO. The church can bind and looseâ She will be easy toward a son like me. SAVELLI. Well, we will talk again some better time. The men you told me of, must sup with usâ Now, prithee, good Gerardoâhaste and bring them. [Exit Gerardo. SAVELLI (alone.) The good Gerardo! foh! what part have I With such a fiend as this? the enchanter fears His own familiar spirit. I cannot need A devil like himâso merciless as he isâ Accursed and eminent above the damned, And black beyond my purpose!âWhat I want Is rank enough no doubtâfalse witness, fraud, Perverted honor, snares for youth, abuse Of trust and innocence, and when pressed as now, It may be more and worse. This sin incarnate Loaths fellowship in such a kind, and walks The earth for blood! He would dig deep his pits For one who fed him, clothed him, housed him, warmed him; And while the murderer's knife is sharp and bareâ Point toward his brother's throat! He was not thusâ O! not like this at firstânor what I am Was Iâbut churchmens' pleasures must be hid: To hide costs much;âhence rapine and abuse Of trust and truthâhence lies, hypocrisy, A perjured tongue; and as the danger spreads, The waste spreads daily. He is at his ease, Does as his nature teaches, and what use Makes pleasant to himâbut for me, the while, I do believe the things which he does notâ That life must cast its reckoning ere it end, Or pay it tenfold afterwards.âWhy should that strength Which might have gained me as its right by nature, Wealth, pleasure, reverence, glory, eminent place; Nay more, a crown to comeâbe tasked as now In twisting cables with the winds and flames, And weaving webs with dust! This Ludovico Is loved of men, shall fill the seat I covet; And though his gifts from Heaven are small to mine, His learning lessâwith that calm pace he passes Where I, with all my jostling and my haste, Can scarcely hope to come. For good or ill, Who ploughs in hope, must watch and labor still; Fix on the furrow's end both eyes and mind, And never pause to rest or look behind. [Exit. SCENE VII. Public Walk. Arezzi and Cimbelli. CIMBELLI. I blame you notâwe are what nature makes us. The costliest of her vessels prove so fine They burst in seasoning: more she forms of clay; Mere dirt, and these last long. In men like you, The print which Fancy leaves to mark her chosen Shines, from the surface, through: thus loveâto most No more than flushes in the dawn of youth, A sort of rosy-color'd brief crepuscule, Which fades before the sun is upâto you Becomes the daylight of the soul, and lasts Till life itself goes out.âEven I, Cimbelli, Could fast, and watch, and weep, and fight, and die, For one fair woman, if there were no moreâ But while the earth feeds two, and both are single, Neither shall grieve me long. AREZZI. You never loved, Yet own Love's powerâwiser in this than mostâ You do not reason with the crazed. CIMBELLI. I might; But some men seem predestinated fools, With sense enough to know they are. I had A brother of this kind, in whom harsh Nature Forced all reluctant qualities to meet. Haughty he was, yet tenderâjust, though froward, Most pitiful, most sternâa giant in wrath, A child in love and mercy. All his soul Was given to one who scorned it. I have seen Impatient anguish watch that pale cold browâ For ever gracious toward inferior fools, Toward him unchangeableâtill shame and pride Burst and dissolved in tears. The pitiless smile Gave life again to bothâso passion roseâ Like him that strove with Hercules of old,â In two-fold vigor from the dust. Now see How strange a kind of two-legg'd thing is this Which stands so totteringly, its own hard sighs Can make it rock and stagger!âa little breath, And that most fragrant, from a little mouth, Not blown in wrath, but peaceful though unkind; Nay less, a lookâand that without a frown, A blank and casual look, composed and heedless, Can roll it bottom upwards! Mercy upon us! AREZZI. Most that endure, repine: hast ever heard Such groans from me? CIMBELLI. Why noâyou keep them down As prudent masters rap their scholars' pates, Commuting cries for tears. Your loveship sits Like Ãolus struggling with his subject winds,â A sceptred king, but sore perplexed to rule. AREZZI. What was this brother's fortune? CIMBELLI. Common enough. Be such an one as he, and live as he did To watch his rivals laugh, hear gossips prattle, How fond the bride, and late she lies in bed, And when they look for issue. AREZZI. HoldâCimbelli! O! senseless, merciless, as thou artâfind out Some other way than this to make me mad. These scorpions did not sleep beforeâpray goâ Let us not meet again. CIMBELLI. Poor babe! dear innocent! AREZZI. What nature wants in manhoodâlet the will Excuse thus farâThough both are weakâHeaven knows! One is not yet subdued. Wouldst prove me fool? Convince the fool of baseness?âI am confessed A fool half madâa slave quite miserable: Abject, indeed, and helpless! but I feel One passion of a man still leftâhis shame. CIMBELLI. Set Shame to buffet Loveâhe is the youngest, And almost always follows hard at hand. AREZZI. This I can help, CimbelliâI will not see Another in my place. She has been mineâ Her looks, her thoughts, affections, wishes, tearsâ I earned them allânot easily, as the price Of short and pleasant serviceâyears have flown In doubt, in awe, in hope, almost in worshipâ Till love, though pure, grew sinful. She has been Single in earth to meâand let me own Far oftener in my thoughts than Heaven. These eyes Have gazed while sickness made its mark for death, And part belonged to each!âI will not see That which I had, transferred. CIMBELLI. Now, what dost swear by? AREZZI. The only thing still left meâit is enoughâ By all I feel of misery! CIMBELLI. You must learn Either to do or sufferâbe brave or patientâ Blow out Love's torch with sighs, or act the man And take what once was given you. Let us walk. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Part of the same Walk. Don Gabriel Lucerna and Don Florez Zava. DON GABRIEL. 'Twill goad him till he roar, I hope. DON FLOREZ. Bewareâ The bull has horns. DON GABRIEL. Then you shall see a bull feast. He comes this way. DON FLOREZ. And by his side, his calf. DON GABRIEL. You may take charge of him. DON FLOREZ. Their faces say Our tale, though false, is old. DON GABRIEL. So much the better: It will be credited the more. [Enter Arezzi and Cimbelli. DON GABRIEL. Arezzi! O! now for words to conjure with! The dreams Which waking Love remembers, Cupid's smiles, And Hymen's promisesâthe things which were, And now are notâdeep vows, warm thoughts, fond whispersâ Grant me this first request. AREZZI. Be brief then with it: My patience suffers with my health to-day. DON GABRIEL. Do one fair service which may grace all three. Don Florez is but slow at rhymes, and I Have little friendship from the amorous Museâ We lisp long prayers in prose. CIMBELLI. And you would have Still less from Love, if Love had eyes or ears. DON GABRIEL. Now who is this? AREZZI. Go on. DON GABRIEL. More practised thou To mingle incense with melodious verse, Shall teach us how to charm Cicilia's couch From grief and barrenness. CIMBELLI. The marquis brought These pleasant words from Spain. DON FLOREZ. Be quiet! dost mark me! CIMBELLI. I doâmost heedfully. AREZZI. You have talked much Of me, and of yourself, elsewhereâDon Gabriel; Extoll'd some happier skill that practice lends you, And prayed a time to prove it?âAnswer me this. DON GABRIEL. If so indeedâwhat then? AREZZI. I might have blushed To baffle a wish so fairâand would have stakedâ With one whose hopes and honors matched mine ownâ The days to come: but nowâgo home and triumph; I have no equal pledge, nor can I lose More than I wish was gone. DON GABRIEL. Well, write instead This epithalamium for the duke. AREZZI. Farewellâ Let me pass on, Lucernaâdo not strike One reeling with the plague. CIMBELLI. It were a sin To send this cid-sperm back!âthe Count Arezzi Is sick to day. DON GABRIEL. Perhaps he loaths his company, As I do too. DON FLOREZ. When thou shalt speak with nobles, Take off the covering from that pate, and turn (Cimbelli takes off his hat.) The plume below. Lowerâstill lower, I sayâ (Cimbelli throws it on the ground.) Soâthat will do. CIMBELLI. I need it for my health; Now go, and pick it up. DON FLOREZ. Your page forgets His place and wits, Arezzi. CIMBELLI. By my soul Thou shalt be fain to bring it where I stand, And give it on thy knee with fear and reverence, Or lie beside it. (Draws.) DON FLOREZ. I will draw my sword On none like thee. CIMBELLI. Then make the better haste To pick me up my hatâdost loiter, sirrah! Let this teach diligence. (Strikes him.) DON GABRIEL. Florez, we will make The calf a sacrifice. (They draw.) CIMBELLI. Soâkeep in front, And both together if you will. AREZZI (drawing.) Stand backâ Coward as thou art! didst dream my scorn was fear? Thou leperous seven-fold liarâknave, pandar, Spaniard! Now let us hear those boastingsâmock me nowâ O! that the fool which sent thee stood beside thee! Look upâwe fight for lifeâI will not take Nor render mercy. (They fight, Don Gabriel falls.) CIMBELLI. That goes near his ribsâ Nay, do not strike him twiceâenough, Arezziâ His jests are spent to dayâbe quiet, and cool The devil within! (To Florez) Thou shouldest go help thy friendâ But I have swornâfirst pick me up my hat. DON FLOREZ. Well, take it then CIMBELLI. Ay, lowerâmine oath!âstill lowerâ So, that will do. Now let us lift him gentlyâ He faintsâmake haste Arezziâhelp! some help! [Exeunt. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Monastery. SAVELLI (alone.) The time for that is goneâGerardo knows it, Arezzi too: these creditors bark round me, And every hour risks all. Who knocks?âcome in. [Enter Ludovico, attended by Gerardo, and other Monks. GERARDO. We wait upon the abbotâgoodâmy brother. SAVELLI. The duke has made his choice then? GERARDO. He has filled Our souls with thankfulness in that! LUDOVICO. Alas! Mine still finds room for care: his highness joins Ungracious duties to the power he lends me, And makes its outset irksomeâhe requires The clearance of our dealings; that we sum Our debts and dues; and bids me take in charge Our brother's office of the bursery here, Till this be done. SAVELLI. So soon? with all my heart! He lifts a burden from my neckâI leave A barren and unthankful task, and wipe Much scandal off. MONK. Pray God you may do so; Its foulness spreads to us. The men we met withâ Who shamed our last night's obsequiesâtook home Some from the gravest of the standers by, To shew the vouchers for these debts, and turned The city's wrath this way.â SAVELLI. We soon will quench it. I have been working longâto gather up The shreds and rovings of my trust, and make Its selvage perfectâleave a seven years charge Compactly rounded to a school-boy's cipheringâ I will require two days. LUDOVICO. 'Tis less than just. Brother, good night. SAVELLI. There are about us here Ill-whispering tongues, beside the knaves we speak ofâ Ay, some more near than theseâin three days hence I will requite their hissing. LUDOVICO. Would to Heaven Nothing were here but love!âgood brother, patience! Do not say so.â MONK. If I am marked as such I wish the three were one. SAVELLI. They may be found As brief as you would have them be. LUDOVICO. Peaceâpeace! [Exit with Monks. Savelli and Gerardo. GERARDO. We are upon the coals at last. SAVELLI. Ay, these Ply with their bellows fiercely! shall we change To lead and melt, or ere the heat prevail, Burst from their shatter'd crucible in flames And blow them to the moon? this crier of peace, Who takes the office that I hold, to patch The one I covet, though they chuse and name him, Is not our abbot yet. GERARDO. You might have asked A little longer time to break his neck. SAVELLI. But then I do not need it. Two days more Will serve for that. Two days! this world has changed Its Lord in less than one: yet myriads live Whose seventy years are ended ere they know If what they think, they are. How many walk With joints no steadier than a maid's at school, That equal Mars in thought! As fancy goads them, They conquer provinces, set free the enslaved, Burn fleets, sack cities, perish in the breach, Mock emperors from the scaffoldâand conclude That fate hath stolen some patriot from the skies, To make him, it may be, a friar, a weaver, A darner of mens' hose! are we like these? If wine alone have moved our tongues so oft, Let us be wiser nowâstop where we are. GERARDO. Gooth sooth! and so in two days more be hanged! SAVELLI. We climb upon the ladder's topâone step Will scale the rampartsâif we rest or turn, A breath will send us down. GERARDO. Your ladder ends Where many take the trouble for their pains To mount, and straight come down another way, Yet never reach the ground. Wellâboldly on, And see which stops the first. SAVELLI. A matchâtake these And give Francisco two, the rest disperse As those of yesterday. (Giving letters.) The Mole and Castle Are safely ours, and some about the Fleet: Our strength is greater than our need. GERARDO. Remember That which I spoke of Andria. SAVELLI. Prithee be goneâ So, we shall lose Arezziâwait, a little. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Chamber in the Palace. Prince of Andria and the Duchess. PRINCE ANDRIA. He has been sent for here. DUCHESS. Then speak it meekly, As if in goodness toward himself, and thus Leave out the offence, which else might reach to both, And drive Arezzi mad. PRINCE ANDRIA. Soâhere he comes. [Enter Cimbelli. You have been quickly found, young man. CIMBELLI. Your Grace Knew where to send and seek me. PRINCE ANDRIA. Good sooth! not I. CIMBELLI. The messenger ran straight toward church, I thought Your Grace had told him where. PRINCE ANDRIA. I prayâbe quiet We are not in the mood for jests all dayâ Our fool talks much at home. I called thee here To chide and punish, but her highness deigns To bid rebuke be still. DUCHESS. We should remember That youth is heady in its spleen, and pride Ferments then mellows: what was harshness first Is strength and flavour left to time. PRINCE ANDRIA. It is so. I have not yet forgotten that I was once Unripe and hard, like these. DUCHESS. Come near Cimbelliâ We will speak kindly with theeâthou dost whet A temper in itself too sharp, and edge The follies of thy friend: the elder thou By much, with larger practice in this world, Dost push him on to brawls, and mix his honor With tavern fellowshipsânayâfie! we know it. PRINCE ANDRIA. We have abridged his purse, whose plenty bought Dishonest licence. CIMBELLI. I beseech your Grace To stop and hear one wordâArezzi's honor Has been his care to keepâand for his gold, I never made it less. PRINCE ANDRIA. We do believe itâ And meant no other: but what we know is this; Ye pick from better men, the loud and idle, With whom ye herd. That quarrel of last night Will not be ended yet. CIMBELLI. Then leave the blame With those who raised it. Had your Grace stood there, Arezzi would have found an abler second, And done the same. DUCHESS. Those with whom you fought Were noble and of Spainâthe duke's companions, Whose honor aches with theirs. CIMBELLI. The Count Arezzi Is noble too, of Naples, and till now, The duke's companionâSpain! ye saints go with us To make us humbler! he will ever beâ Though not from Spain, their equal. Shall he lie A jack for boys to quoit at? when I named him Less reverently, as you thought, of lateâI seemed No better than one's neighbour's cat surprised With butter in her mouth. Your highness stamped, Set wide the door, called me a thief, or worse, And hissed me out. For thisâso help me Heaven The honor which I felt before, I doubledâ One still is leftâI saidâwho loves the Count. DUCHESS. Well, so I did. CIMBELLI. Your highness does so yet, Or why those tears? DUCHESS. Bless that mis-shapen pate Which if not wise, is honestâI will love Both him and thee. PRINCE ANDRIA. There will be proof of that In what we mean to do. Our ward Arezzi Is noble, was provoked, had cause for cholerâ It was not so with theeâyet thou didst fall The first to gibes, strike one of princely blood, And rail unshamed!âbe still, I say, and hear meâ Thou canst not rest in Naples. DUCHESS. Let the duke Learn to forget thee first, and then return With wiser customs home. PRINCE ANDRIA. We will employ thee Where trust is honorâmake good haste to goâ Our letters shall be sealed to-night, to-morrow They must set out toward Spain. CIMBELLI. Your Grace Will grant a day or two beyond to-morrow? PRINCE ANDRIA. For what, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. Tears, forsooth, and kissesâ I am in love. DUCHESS. 'Twere wise to shorten grief. PRINCE ANDRIA. The maid will find a comforterâor Time Will make her worth the more. CIMBELLI. 'Tis not a maidâ Nor will Time mend her. Let her highness speakâ I only ask two days. DUCHESS. Wellâcount this, oneâ And then I may. PRINCE ANDRIA. It is not wisely done; But if your highness wills it soâso be it. [Exeunt Prince Andria and Duchess. CIMBELLI. Ye both shall bear these letters to the king, And tell him news yourselves of us and Naplesâ I will keep house. âCome near me, good Cimbelli! âWe would speak kindly with thee!â Two days hence, Cimbelli may begin to comfort thee, And play the part of patronage. The duchess Will love Arezzi and myself, and Iâ Whether he does or notâwill love the duchess. [Exit. SCENE III. The Palace Garden, at Night. On one side, the Palace lightedâon the other, the Sea. AREZZI. Their shadows move upon the walls within, And o'er the softer cadences of song, I hear their mirth! what was so pleasant onceâ Night with her coolness, and that crimson moon Whose rising wakes the nightingaleâthe flowers, Too prodigal of their dewy sweetness, now Tire and offend. I would not breathe again The orange-blossom's fragrance thus, or hear The fountain waters dash their marble vase. No sounds disturb the moonlight sea beyond: They seem to rest whose barks are anchored there, This music does not reach to them!âbut I Shall sleep no more till deathâmy heart still tells me Its throbs are numbered.âAmong so many blessed, There is but one that can remember yet The wretch shut out:âshe would forget me too If fear were not as strong as this new loveâ Now they must watch together, and a breast So innocent once, become the incestuous couch Where shame engenders falsehood! Let her bring New lies upon her lips, and then go back To flutter in the light of those fair halls, Breathe their sweet incense, render sigh for sigh, Or dubious pressure of dividing palms, And blush beneath the lengthened gaze of loveâ She did so, late, with me.âThe strongest takes her, And I, who might be such, stand here aloof For fools to bate and hoot at!âharkâshe comesâ [Enter Cicilia. You keep your faith in this. CICILIA. I do indeedâ In this, and all things elseâif not toward all, At least with you. AREZZI. I would have doubted once The vows of dying saints as soon, or spurned A vestal's sacraments. CICILIA. Then why not still? What promise have I made and brokeâArezzi? AREZZI. You said that you would love me. CICILIA. So I do. AREZZI. Ayâas you love ten thousandâall mankindâ Your neighbour and your enemyâfor this Heaven bless your charity! CICILIA. O! patienceâpatienceâ AREZZI. Then do not mock meâI am wretched now, And speak I scarce know what. There is a time When grief is less than misery, and respires A mournful fragrance for the sighs it breathesâ Such melancholy greets its sorrows mildly, And dallies with light pangs: but after this Comes bitterness accursed and unallayed, Whose taste is torment. No man ever yet Knew and endured it longâthough many talk Of patience wisely, many too have borne Life's miseries noblyâthese had light within; Their darkness was not blackness, helpless, hopelessâ They never felt as I do, or their cries Had been as loud as mine. CICILIA. What shall I say?â Believe me still, Arezzi. AREZZI. Speak the truth, And then I willâsay that a man should keep His follies to himself, and hide his shameâ That the proud heart may burst, but not repineâ That he who tells its sufferings, owns its baseness.â I say so too myselfâdisdain, not tears, Should meet the unfaithfulâbut that fire consumes First peace, then manhood; levels pride, and brings Our strength to this. CICILIA. You will not hear me speak! AREZZI. Say that you love me still. CICILIA. I do. AREZZI. But how? Now speak and save me if you doâmy brain Rocks dizzily, and from the sea and air I hear a voice which calls meâI may bring On other heads than ours that palace roofâ Soâall will perish! Promise to be mineâ Give me that hand again. CICILIA. I cannot promise. AREZZI. Noâwhy? CICILIA. I have already promised. AREZZI. Ah! To whom, Cicilia? CICILIA. Nothing more than that Which truth and honor will confirm, believe me. AREZZI. What promiseâand to whom? CICILIA. This is unjust. AREZZI. Tell me that promiseâI must know what promiseâ CICILIA. I am unhappy tooâyou will not hear me. AREZZI. Speak plainly, and I willâthere is a promise? Now tell me what it is. CICILIA. I cannot tell you. AREZZI. Dissemblerâtraitress! CICILIA. You will grieve hereafter That you have called me such. It is because The faith which never bent its gaze from you, Is kept toward all. AREZZI. Hast promised love to all? CICILIA. To none but you. AREZZI. What double vows are these? CICILIA. If you have ever loved me yetâbelieve me, And ask no more. [Arezzi kisses her. AREZZI. I am contentâfarewell! Be wise and secretâkeep your promise nowâ Still talk of faith and honor!âWhat I blame Is not that Fancy changes, or that Love Hath eyes for goldâbut that, while truth were safest, You chose deceit, and made me feel my shame Even worse than all the restânow goâadieu! CICILIA. Alas! not thus, Arezzi!âLet us part As those who love unhappily, but feel No worse than grief.âYou will think justly yet: Yesâwhen it is too late, you will believe me! If we must partâit should be somewhere elseâ Not here, where love began! These walks are witness Of what it has been! AREZZI. Cruel! to speak of this! CICILIA. If I were what you call me, should I stand To wait and sueâbear injuries like theseâ And say I love you still? AREZZI. Tell me that promiseâ You see my soul tormentedâO! no, no! You might have bidden farewell without deceit Said that you must forsake meâleft me here Less shameful tears!âI could have loved you then Through time and sorrow, still unchanged, and mourned The lost, as those we weep, yet think in Heaven. CICILIA. I can do more, Arezziâlove the unkind, Forgive the ungratefulâsorrow for the lostâ Bear shame itself unchangedâhopeless, still prayâ Wronged and suspected, keep my faithâand bid Farewell without reproach. I have forgotten My place too longâa princess and a maid Has sued unheeded, unbelieved, and stooped Her head to thisâwe shall not meet again For anger and disgrace!âFarewell, Arezzi. [Exit. AREZZI. If this should be a dreamâthis dreadful half Of what I fear and sufferâlet me find Her bosom unpolluted when I wake, And sleep again for ever!âGrief can raise Its dÃ¦mons, and the hot and jealous brain Is quick with fallaciesâbetter doubt these Than that which ever yet was truth! It is Savelli's lieâGerardo'sâGabriel'sâFlorezâ An universal lie! and she who owns them, Has made no promises! Thus will I use Her truth against her wordâand keep my patience While that most gracious and lacivious fool Shall question which loves mostâwhich most she lovesâ Gaze in her eyes provoking smiles, and force Reluctant kisses from the severed lips Till passion yield themâwhat I dare not ask, Take as his right.âO! but he never shallâ Never till I am dust! I hope not then. [Exit. SCENE IV. Public Walk. Cimbelli and Gerardo. GERARDO. It is a perilous strait! to speak my knowledge Seems like a wrong toward Charityâto hide it Were lack of love indeed! CIMBELLI. Well, speakâwhat is it? Rock Charity to sleep. GERARDO. The general tongue Clamors its censures loudly, and mine own But echos what it says. CIMBELLI. This general tongue Belongs to foul-mouthed Fameâand Fame tells liesâ And lies should not be echoed. GERARDO. Men must know Their frailties to repent them: thou art blamed For words too liberal, and a life beside Too like thy words. CIMBELLI. I would that I could hear The same sins laid to theeâno tongue hath said Thy words and life are paired. GERARDO. Alas we errâ And shall we not be humbled? Is it hard That they who drink to drunkenness of sin, Should wake at last in shame! CIMBELLI. Come, comeâbe honest. Prithee speak out: I cannot talk in verseâ I do abhor your figures!âdrunk with sin, Now sick and sober!âThere are eyes abroad Which see by starlight, and have found thee, father, Where thou wouldst not be known. GERARDO. Mark me, young man, We too have eyes for darkness, and our ears Can hear what yours cannot. CIMBELLI. I do believe! Dark doings need quick ears. Who walks by night Must look before, or woe-betide his nose. You bear some witches lanthornâyou can trace The blind worm's path for leagues without a moon, And circumvent the jackal. When you pray, The frightened stars go outâfrom village towers The bells untouched ring mournfullyâthe wolves Look up and howlâand from the gibbet's nail The murderer's hand gets loose to free his head! Three times, as old men say, before her travail, Your mother met a judgeâand dreamed all night That screech-owls stood as sponsors to the babe, While bats and molewarps nursed it. GERARDO. Who said this? CIMBELLI. The same that told thee what I doâhe is A knave no doubt: but patienceâwe go forth Each where his nature guidesâthe light leads me, Loud tongues, loose fancies, laughing lips and eyesâ I hate all mysteries. GERARDO. Thou dost, Cimbelli? So, Heaven be praised! my hands are clean in thisâ My knowledge is not now my sin.âBe merryâ Sing like some April cuckoo all day long The same dull note, for rustic fools to mock atâ Their jest, then weariness. Thou that lovest light, Come not too near the fire!âit were as wise To bruise one's nose, as burn it. Lips may grin Without a gibe. Pray that my prayers may free The gibbet from that coxcomb thereâand so Go warily, sir Fool!âLook well about thee, Nor slip nor stumbleâor it yet may roll A rood beyond its shoulders. I would hint What makes it rock thus giddilyâbut thou Dost loath all mysteries! so peace be with thee! [Exit. CIMBELLI. What! treachery, ha!âthis dog-fox scents us grossly! I could not listen for my noise! My tongue Rides courier to mine ears, and leads them on Where I may lose all three!âHalloo! and after. [Exit. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Palace. Prince of Andria and the Duchess, meeting. DUCHESS. Your eyes speak firstâthey tell me something good! Haste and interpret what it is. PRINCE ANDRIA. I will. Love spurns his old obstructions, right and left; The hard encumbrances of twenty yearsâ Now the heart makes its offerings unperplexedâ Honor not lessened by its loveâand love Sublimed, not cooled, by reverenceâread these letters. DUCHESS. They came from Spain? PRINCE ANDRIA. Whose character is this? DUCHESS. Our prayers then are fulfilled!âI know the writing. PRINCE ANDRIA. The king has called me kinsmanâand our child, His son and nephewâlook! how good and gracious! DUCHESS. The royal hand itself! PRINCE ANDRIA. And here he tells us To make our marriage public when we please.â âYour wisdom shall choose for you what to do, âAnd how to claim your place. It is our will âThat Ferdinand be proclaimed and crownedâyourselves âStand near enough to judge if this your secret âShould follow briefly to the public ear; âOr come the first; or both be heard at once. âLook to the people wellâtheir thoughts will guide you, âAnd He, whose care you are. We will not mix âYour history in the letters to our sonâ âTell it when best yourselves.â DUCHESS. Well, tell it now. PRINCE ANDRIA. To-dayâto-morrowâwhen you willâbut say, Have we been wise in waiting? Was it wrong To watch the perfecting of time like this? Now we may teach Arezzi what he is. DUCHESS. To-morrow is his birth-day. PRINCE ANDRIA. Let him learn This and the rest at once. DUCHESS. He shall do soâ And many who would have made these clouds the blacker Shall learn it too. PRINCE ANDRIA. To-morrow? We must make haste. DUCHESS. There will be time enough to call the guests: We can prepare a banquet, where the duke May practise royalty ere his throne is builtâ The court expects no less, and he will thank us: The feast may seem for him. PRINCE ANDRIA. And then, what next? DUCHESS. Then while a thousand eyes flash hate or love, We will proclaim the birth-day of our childâ A prince, and sprung from kings, our own Arezzi! PRINCE ANDRIA. So, hide it from the duke, meanwhile? DUCHESS. From all But one. PRINCE ANDRIA. Cicilia? DUCHESS. Grief, I know not why, As envious as the meekness which would tire itâ Hath wrought with double strength to-day, and made Her silence worse than cries. I would not waste The comfort of an hour. PRINCE ANDRIA. I had forgottenâ Here hope seems kindling too. The duke shall have An Austrian princess for his queen. DUCHESS. Who says so? PRINCE ANDRIA. The king. DUCHESS. This perfects all I wishâcome, come. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Abbey Cloisters. Cimbelli and Gerardo. CIMBELLI. Nay, but you chew it crossways. GERARDO. Let me goâ CIMBELLI. Let us go both together. GERARDO. Good or ill, And whether what you think or not, I am Of what I was thus muchâI love too kindly Such as I loved at firstâthe free, the sportive, A merry heart like yours; and it would press Far heavier on my spirit than greater sins, To see the snare and watch the heedless perish. CIMBELLI. Now this is kindly said. GERARDO. The light leads youâ I am the while a bat, a screech-owl's godchild, A fright, a portentâominous as it is, My voice was raised to warn you. CIMBELLI. What dost wish? I will repent. GERARDO. 'Tis time, young man!âby this My words and doings may seem more akin. CIMBELLI. The words are goodâand for the rest, Gerardo, I would not coax, and sue, and tell a lie To save as many threatened heads as his That barked in hell!âso speak, or else good dayâ Art one of us? GERARDO. I cannot answer thatâ But hark!âstand still, you must not be so hasty:â You talked of late with Andria?âYou shall hear And answer meâmy brother and the duchess?â Now can I tell of what?â CIMBELLI. Well, do. GERARDO. You touched,â And sharply too,âthe beggary of your friend, Hinted his griefs, and ended that he lives Deprived, deserted, wronged? CIMBELLI. I did. GERARDO. You saidâ Unwisely as I thinkâthat Nature yields The authority of man to men, and law In this hath strengthened Nature? CIMBELLI. I did not. GERARDO. Then it was rendered wrong. Mark me, my son; The lesson, if we live, may do thee good; If not, it is but lost.âStand wide of quarrels, Nor kick the dog which bites thy neighbour's heel. When strong men smite the weakâgo home in silence. If Ahab lack a vineyard, bid him take itâ Though Naboth be thy brother. If a house Consume with fire at midnight, let it burn Unless thine own stand near. And if the church, In which lie sepulchred thy father's bones, Should chance to shakeâ'tis better that it fall Than risk thine own in propping it. CIMBELLI. By the mass! Mine was a silly squeamishness of lateâ I might have said at first, had I heard this, Thy words and deeds agree; good father, where Didst learn thy catechism? GERARDO. What Andria points at Heaven knows, not I! To covet is a sin Which most besets old age. He is my brotherâ Mine elder brotherâbut the near in blood May stand aloof in will. CIMBELLI. Why trueâyou pair No better than the weasel and the stoteâ One wears the bushier tail. GERARDO. Hear me, Cimbelli! Mouths which revile the mighty must be closedâ The sooner if they speak the truthâand thine Hath long stood wide: it spatters at the church, Blasphemes her ministers, vents, scoffs and jeers At us, and all. CIMBELLI. Stop there, and take one halfâ I ever loved the church, and some I honor Whose mother she is, not all. GERARDO. So much the worse; Now this is heresyâso rank a goat To choose between her shepherds; he sins less Who hates them all!âthe discipline fails here Which happier Spain can furnishâshe may lop The barren branches off, and purge with fire The stock which profits not;âthou shalt bear hence A message to the king? CIMBELLI. What if I do? GERARDO. His majesty may save a soulâand lend The inquisitors to help thy faith. CIMBELLI. Ye faggots! What, burn me? GERARDO. Hush! man, hush! CIMBELLI. I ever loathed This heathenish cookery where they roast men wholeâ And must I make a dish? GERARDO. We may be watched. I barely keep the windward of mine oath, As servant of the officeâand have borrowed From Faith too much for Charityâcome hither!â I saw the accusation; this right hand Subscribed it, sealed it, sent it. Those in Spain Can do what we cannot. While Andria lives, Take heed!âdost hear me?âWhile he lives be careful. [Exit. CIMBELLI. Father, adieu! I thank you for your newsâ Your prayers and blessing at your better leisure. 'Tis well the plug is near to caulk this hole, Or mercy on my boat!âPrince Andriaâverily! Old Honor's leading staff!âThe slime of Nileâ With all its sun-engendered snakes and verminâ Hath never hatched so strange a chick as this, Bird, beast, or fish! A sphinx with claws and riddles! Part cat, part crocodile!âpat me, and coax me, Call me kind names forsooth!âjumped just in time! But one day left. I stood so near the fire My doublet seems to smell of it. And nowâ It is as I could wish. The popular voice, Some yearnings of mine own, above all Arezziâ Who would abhor the hand which plucked one hair From that devil's head of hisâhave kept between us, Turned back my sword, and, but for this, to-morrow Had seen its work ill done. The kingly babe May travel with his aunt toward Spainâbut Andria! That brain of thine is dangerous. I will shove Remorse behind me, think upon the flames, And dash it out.âArezzi may repine; But when the thing is ended, it will be Both well and wiselyâjustly done and fairly. So let your politic pate rest whole till morn, Then take its leave of night capsâgood prince Andria. [Exit. SCENE VII. An Apartment in the Palace. Duke, Duchess, Prince of AndriaâOfficers and Attendants. PRINCE ANDRIA. We have dispatched those warrants from your Grace. The time is brief indeed, with much to do. [Enter an Officer with a letter. Well, who brought this? OFFICER. I cannot learn his name: Your highness saw the man alone last night. He seemed in haste. PRINCE ANDRIA. Soâthis will tell us more. Now send us Asti hither. [Enter Asti. O!âgoodâyour Grace Shall learn it from his lips. DUCHESS. To-night, you say, We must expect these traitors here? DUKE. How many? ASTI. I cannot search their numbers, but enough To make division of their strength. PRINCE ANDRIA. One third Will scale Saint Elmo?âwe are sure of these. ASTI. There is another for the Mole and Fleetâ The strongest third I hear. PRINCE ANDRIA. So much the better. Gold has been scattered there I know: at dusk We shall withdraw their garrisons elsewhere. ASTI. The last is destined here. PRINCE ANDRIA. No doubt the trustiest. DUCHESS. Whence did he learn all this? PRINCE ANDRIA. From one among them, Who has a capital part to play, and yet Knows little but his share. ASTI. He told beside That we might find old faces at the feastâ But knew not whose. PRINCE ANDRIA. No matter.âIt is set down That some should enter first, you say, in masks? ASTI. Yesâten or twelve, and masked. They come as guests, Their dress and carriage suited to the place, Till others left behind shall break the doors, And enter too. PRINCE ANDRIA. Thus one may seem a scoreâ While every man is feared and fears the rest! ASTI. I learnt no more. PRINCE ANDRIA. Then hasten to the Mole, And see that what we bid is doneâquick! quick! [Exit Asti. We have from other mouths a warning tooâ Now what says this? (Reads the letter.) âWatch all tonightâbeware âOf guests with crimson scarfs and golden vizars, âFor such are dangerous.ââSoâI wish we had More space to make them welcome. DUCHESS. They seem, like us, Scarce ready, and in haste. PRINCE ANDRIA. Faith! they do well; They might have waited long a chance more likely. Who wake and sleep with danger in their thoughts Are restless till it come. DUKE. Shall we prevent them, And chuse some other night. PRINCE ANDRIA. Not for the world; Your Grace will pardon that I speak so plainlyâ I would not for the world. DUCHESS. We should be glad That all we fear must show itself and end. PRINCE ANDRIA. We dare not hope it may be granted twice To bind invisible Danger, spite his charms, And force him to the light. DUCHESS. These snakes crawl out, But while our eyes are on them, cannot harm us. PRINCE ANDRIA. They leave their holes at last, to meet the sun:â These crimson skinned and golden headed vipersâ Let them slink back to grow and multiply; And we may feel their poison in our flesh, Ere they be seen again. Come in thereâho! Give some one this. Now stir thee, good Filippoâ Pick me out twenty men, the best we haveâ Such as can understand usâfind them masks, Let them be armed, and habited as guests, Then wait upon us here.âYour Grace will pardon. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. A Vineyard, at Sun-set. Arezzi, Cimbelli, and Savelli. AREZZI. Art sure of that, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. Yes, I am. AREZZI. Let us look warily before we go, And keep the offering uncorrupt! our feet Are on the temple stepsâa single spot Defiles the victimâwe should search within To see that nothing sensual, selfish, proud, Mix with the sacrifice. We give our hearts Untainted to this work? CIMBELLI. I do. AREZZI. Speak, father. SAVELLI. I answer to my conscience, son: my vows Are made elsewhere. AREZZI. Speak outâwe will know more. Is it for Naples or ourselves? her tears Must follow what we do, and he is damned Past hope or mercy hereâsevenfold hereafterâ Who thinks his idols holier than her peace, Or lightly turns him to a work like this. SAVELLI. Well, let him be so thenâourselves will make Her health the record of our thoughts; Arezzi, To this one end I live. AREZZI. Then goâboth goâ That double curse would meet me if I went! When Naples sufferedâwhat was that to me? I never saw her blushes, till lost hopes, Pride, discontent, a splenetic hate of wrong, And love with jealousy disturbed the dreamer. SAVELLI. Thus slaves learn truth: who suffers not, may doubt Lest bile have bred the ills his neighbour mourns. You know from what you feel. CIMBELLI. Why, Count, this love Hath drawn thy tun of wisdom fairly out, Nor left its lees to smell at;âlet us make haste Where Justice sweats in fur, and shame the guardian. Ask for thy father's lands, gold, servants, honorsâ Tell who has turned the public gaze this way And made distrust disgraceâwhose breath it was That scorched the spring-shoots of thy love, transferred Thy mistress to his masterâblew thee forth A pennyless vagrant from their court, and swelled Spain's windy parasites to mock and brave thee! SAVELLI. Thou shalt have right! the doors stand wide for judgment, And all are welcome there. CIMBELLI. O! blind and feeble! They will not leave thee such a dog as I For guide or comforter. I must be goneâ First, whiptâthen, hangedânext, burnt! a smoke-dried herring Scorched black to cure the weevils!âthey have found me With moonlight hedge-hogs, leagued against the calvesâ A Faun, a Puck, a Succubus, a Foliot, The he-cat of some hagâa witch-hermaphrodite With dugs to suckle fiends. Because I laugh, Our holy mother shakes the rock she stands onâ My jests are heresiesâso hence to Spain Where fire must search and purge them. AREZZI. Fie! believe not! Who told this tale, Cimbelli? CIMBELLI. One it was That knew the truthâI cannot answer moreâ Father, what sayest thou? SAVELLI. Only one could know it; And he could not have told it. CIMBELLI. Why? SAVELLI. Look!âOne Whose habit answers mine, whose blood is noblerâ If any else, 'tis false. CIMBELLI. Thou dingy cherub! I will believe thee still. AREZZI. I dread to think it. SAVELLI. Well, set this murderous treachery out of sight, There may be cause enough for what we do. AREZZI. And still the thought is dreadful. SAVELLI. Be thyself: We have a bond on Fortune. AREZZI. Most success Breeds most remorse! These eyes must see their tears Who loved me once. CIMBELLI. Wouldst keep them all thyself? Hast thou not had thy share? they were content To look on thine. AREZZI. But still they nursed and fed me: I render scorpions for the bread they gave. SAVELLI. O! this might suit some virgin twelve years oldâ Our enterprize needs men. CIMBELLI. The king and queen, Who hold to-night a kind of wedding feast, Would keep the Count a virgin all life through. SAVELLI. I must awayâwe trust you, Count, thus far: The rest we will discharge ourselves. For those So loved and mourned we must provide without you. Who joins the risk shares powerâif some shall suffer, We cannot hear your prayers. AREZZI. Give me your promiseâ Mine oaths shall be as strongly sworn as yoursâ Promise to spare these fourâthe duke, the duchess, Prince Andria, and Ciciliaâswear to save themâ To guard their persons, honors, health, and peaceâ Leave them untouched to me, and if I need it, To help me for their safety. SAVELLI. Well, what follows? AREZZI. I will not pause, or swerve, or look behind; But yield my heart and sword to you and Naplesâ So may I live or perish! SAVELLI. I do, Arezzi. AREZZI. This promise is for you, and all who serve you? SAVELLI. Again I swear. AREZZI. Cimbelli, kneel with us. CIMBELLI. I cannot swear half this. AREZZI. Thou canst not swear it? Then all are free again. SAVELLI. Be ruled, my sonâ Dost hold thy wrath above the health of Naples? Fie! fie!âkneel down. CIMBELLI. Thou hast redeemed a life. My honour and my soul are bound together, And both stand pledged to this. SAVELLI. It is enough. The leaders wait, farewell!âTo-morrow, Count, I meet them face to face. Be strong, yet waryâ Look full of hope, and be so. Shew this seal; They know it, and will obey it. [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An Anti-Chamber in the Palace. Duke, Duchess, Prince of Andria, and Officers. PRINCE ANDRIA. You know your duties, gentlemen;âbe careful! Watch all that come to-night, but keep yourselves, With those who serve you, in the halls below; And while these traitors pass, guard well the stairs. OFFICERS. We will obey your highness. PRINCE ANDRIA. So far, good night. [Exeunt Officers. Now where are those in masks?âwhat ho! Filippoâ Good saints! it is almost the timeâlights, lightsâ Let the guests enter when the rooms are ready; And bid the chamberlains attend his Grace. DUKE. I hear the trumpetsâsome are here already. PRINCE ANDRIA. When shall we see Arezzi? DUKE. Will he come? DUCHESS. He had our message yesterday, and then Seemed much perplexed: to-day, I sent another, And still he answered savingly awryâ If he could come, he would. My message now Commands his presence in your highness' name, And instantly.âO! here he is who bore it. DUKE. What answer does the Count Arezzi send us? SERVANT. He bade me tell your highness to expect himâ Said if he come alone, he will be here, And that it is his duty. PRINCE ANDRIA. This becomes him. DUKE. A fair reply indeed. PRINCE ANDRIA. Her highness' ladiesâ What pages wait? make haste! [Enter Filippo, with Persons masked. Bravely Filippo! These are well furnished, and, I hope, all armed.â Take off your masksâyou have not much to learn, So, good my friends, be perfect. You must watch, As loose spectators midst our guests to-night, For nine or tenâperhaps moreâwith scarfs and vizarsâ Observe them well, and by the signs I give you: Their scarfs are crimson silkâtheir vizars giltâ Walk near them where they goâif they divide, Sever your numbers tooâlet two tend one; And when I bid, lay hold.âNow go your waysâ And good Filippo keep your eyes among them. DUKE. Well, is the music ready? PRINCE ANDRIA. Send these gentlemen. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Apartment in the Palace, lighted, decorated, and filled with Guests, some of whom are masked and some not. The Duke, Duchess, Cicilia, and Prince of Andria, enter.âThe Music ceases, the Guests rise. DUKE. The time is chosen for our mirth, not ceremony. We will accept no homage from our guests And claim no power but thisâto bid them welcome. Their presence brings us honorâwe behold The stars which make our firmament so gloriousâ The light and health of Naples. [Enter Arezzi and ten others, with masks and scarfs. DUCHESS. Let us think That none is here who loves us not, and so Once moreâall welcome! PRINCE ANDRIA (to the DUCHESS.) Lookâthe scarfs and vizars! Right to a manâtheir leader makes eleven. We must not seem to watch. DUCHESS. Then call the music. Song. All that nature has is thine! Earth's delights, and Ocean's wealth, Bread, and oil, and fruit, and wineâ Land of pleasureâair of health. From thee, Misfortune hides her frown; Life's sunny bark floats gaily down; While Pleasure rests the useless oarâ The winds are calm, the skies are clear, Thou hast not much to wish or fearâ And nothing to deplore! Pass in bliss the hours away, Gather from the rose and vineâ Every dew-drop yields a rayâ And the dew of love is wine. DUCHESS. I cannot find Arezzi hereâthis boy Is not come yet. PRINCE ANDRIA. It may be he is masked. DUCHESS. Why will he ever thwart us thus! PRINCE ANDRIA. Be patientâ And let him rest awhileâI think not of him: These traitors must be dealt with first. DUCHESS. See!âsee!â They part and walk asunder. PRINCE ANDRIA. Goodâyou have A servant at the back of eachâour followers Are near enough behind. DUCHESS. That tallest seems To lead the rest. PRINCE ANDRIA. I have mine eyes upon himâ He is their guide, no doubt. DUKE. When shall we see his face? PRINCE ANDRIA. Wait till the rest are safeâlet us not scareâ By shooting at their leading stag too soonâ The herd behind. DUKE. Now where is Count Arezzi? DUCHESS. Either not here or masked. PRINCE ANDRIA. When these are netted, We shall unvizar allâlook for him then. CICILIA. They walk this way! PRINCE ANDRIA. No matterâlet your eyes Pass lightly over them. [Arezzi and one Conspirator approach. DUCHESS. Our guests seem idle. PRINCE ANDRIA. The musicâho! thereâwill your highness dance? We must deceive the time. DUKE. Cousin, dance with me. The Count Arezzi will not envy this, Or let him come and claim you. He forgets His promise to us allâWhat pale and trembling! Room thereâand music. (A Dance.) AREZZI. Ah! she smiled at thatâ What was it that he said? CONSPIRATOR. Arezzi claims youâ Now let him come and take you. AREZZI. So I willâ Wait but a minute, both. CONSPIRATOR. They watch us yetâ AREZZI. How long Cimbelli loiters. CONSPIRATOR. Harkâa noiseâ Voices below. AREZZI. Be ready thenâthey comeâ I did not hear it. CONSPIRATOR. Nowâboth cries and weaponsâ AREZZI. If so, it is Cimbelliâhold! CONSPIRATOR. Again! AREZZI. This music stuns meâwhat was that? CONSPIRATOR. Hushâhush! Prince Andria's eyes are on us. PRINCE ANDRIA. Louder music! These pipers sleep! AREZZI. Now there is something stirringâ I hear it plain enough at lastâfall back, And join the rest. PRINCE ANDRIA. Their captain seems to shake. DUCHESS. Look! look! he leads Cicilia toward the door! The audacious traitor! whispering in her ear! AREZZI. Fly, princessâgo this way. CICILIA. From what? AREZZI. Griefâshameâ The sight of danger. CICILIA. Whither? AREZZI. To the church. CICILIA. Who is it that bids me fly? AREZZI. One that has lovedâ Still loves and pities! CICILIA. Who is it? Arezzi? If thou canst love or pity, fly thyselfâ Lost!âthou art lostâbetrayed! O! madman, traitor! DUCHESS. Peace! still a tumult, Andria! PRINCE ANDRIA. I hope their strength Is less than what we meet it with! [Enter an Officer. Now? quickâ OFFICER. It is all ended. PRINCE ANDRIA. Safely? OFFICER. Some are deadâ The rest, my lord, are ours. PRINCE ANDRIA. Goâwatch the doors. Silence that musicâguard the duke who love himâ Let none go out.âTreason! conspiracy! Look all this wayâand now unmaskâthou traitor! [Prince Andria plucks the mask from Arezzi, and while the Conspirators attempt to draw their swords, the masked Attendants rush upon them, and bind them. GUESTS. Arezzi! Count Arezzi! DUCHESS. Merciful God! It is our child! DUKE. Carry the princess outâ Call help there!âhaste! [Prince Andria gazes at Arezzi, and dashes the mask on the ground. PRINCE ANDRIA. Thou traitor! AREZZI. I am noneâ Naples shall judge her childrenâwhich are faithful! I would have sent the usurper home to Spain, And loosed her from her shameâbut ye are traitorsâ Ye hold your rotten fortunes from a thief Who stole them ere he gave them. Slaves of Spain! It is your gold which gilds the calf you worship. I did not mean to liveâall that we lose Is Naples' loss, not our's. PRINCE ANDRIA. Take them awayâ What is it that you wait for? DUCHESS. Let me speakâ [The Conspirators are taken out. PRINCE ANDRIA. O! peaceânot now. I do adjure your highness! It is my prayerâmake me not madâquite mad!â His Grace would be in private. DUKE. Leave us, friends, Till we can meet more happilyâfarewell! [The Guests retire, the Duchess sits down and covers her face with her hands. [Enter Asti. The ships and Mole are safe. DUKE. Then Heaven be praised! PRINCE ANDRIA. I would be thankful if I couldâthis boy Perverts my prayers, and what were asked as mercies, Are maledictions to us both!ânow goâpray go, [To Filippo. Keep them all separateâdost thou understand me? Well, what dost stare and gape at? get thee goneâ Divide their leadersâlodge Arezzi singlyâ We will direct the rest. DUKE. Good aunt, take comfort. You shall distribute mercy where you pleaseâ I know you love Arezzi. DUCHESS. You may grant him A base and shameful lifeâand I will ask it. But honorânone can beg or give again. [Exit with Prince Andria. DUKE. Are many hurt? ASTI. The most of those below; And some are dead. Their captain led them madlyâ Yet wisely too for one who hates a ropeâ Twice through the guards up stairs. His neck seems charmedâ Perhaps the gibbet may have better luck; But none of these could break it. DUKE. Is he known? ASTI. He was the Count's companionâone Cimbelli. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Street at Night. Savelli and Gerardo. SAVELLI. Prayâprayâmake haste. GERARDO. I have made better haste The other road, Savelli. When I run It is not toward a jailâif we must go, We shall be sent forâwait till then. SAVELLI. Fool, as thou art! To trifle now! there is one chance of safety. GERARDO. Why trueâyour jails are safe enough, at least! No danger there of drowning! We escape Whatever travellers risk by land or sea, And all the snares of drinking, wenching, feasting; Men seldom die of surfeits there. But now, Brother, be quiet! the game we played is lost! They keep their king and bishopsâlet us shut The tables and be gone. SAVELLI. Where shall we go? The Roads and Port are guarded seven miles round. Hast wings or fins? Canst live in air or water? O! do not thwart me now! our secret rests In silence yet upon a single tongueâ That stoptâwe sleep all night without a dream, And wake to-morrow perfect. GERARDO. Whose? Arezzi's? SAVELLI. There were but two that knew itâbeside thyselfâ Arezzi and Cimbelliâone is goneâ The Count sees Death look hard and black upon him, And youth may flinch from pain.âAndria would give His life for your's or mine. GERARDO. Run thenârun on. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The State Prison.âNight. Duchess, Prince of Andria, Provost, and Attendants. PRINCE ANDRIA. My brother and a friar? What friar? Savelli? PROVOST. I do not know his nameâhe called himself Confessor to the Count, and as I think, He also said his tutor. After these There came a female, veiled, who prayed to see himâ She wept and offered gold. PRINCE ANDRIA. And you refused it? PROVOST. I answered as became mine officeâprince. Still she besought and wept. DUCHESS. And how, at last? PROVOST. She called her maids and left me. DUCHESS. Veiledâwith servants! You that can bar your doors against a woman, Might shut them to a monk. PROVOST. I would have done so: But one was brother to his Grace, and both Spoke loudly of their rights. DUCHESS. That female speaks Ever of her's too meeklyâsir, she is kin To him and me. PRINCE ANDRIA. Well, mend your error nowâ And since you have them, keep them.âBy my truth, They both shall tarry where they are! Dost hear? Put them in wardâyou have my warrant for it. Who knows these foxes' earths? O! Guido, you; Goâsearch their cells. Meet us at homeâmake haste. [Exit Officer. What prisoners have you here beside the Count? PROVOST. There is Allori, Rota, Guazzo, Vasi, And that Cimbelli.â PRINCE ANDRIA. Stop nowâsome one told me The last of these was dead. PROVOST. 'Twas so believedâ He fell, with eight or ten of those he fought with, Twice down the stairs. Many he struck are maimedâ He was but stunned. DUCHESS. Then, Provost, let us see him. PRINCE ANDRIA. And make that rumor spread itself: his friends May speak the plainer if they think him dead. DUCHESS. Walk on, and show the way. PRINCE ANDRIA. But first, your Grace Will send our letter to the duke? DUCHESS. Come with meâ Better tell all ourselves. PRINCE ANDRIA. What, now? DUCHESS. Why not? This secret has been kept too long. PRINCE ANDRIA. We must Be speedy with it then: the clock strikes twoâ At three the council will attend us here. DUCHESS. Provost, we shall returnâstay where you are. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Prison.âNight. Arezzi, Savelli, and Gerardo. GERARDO. Strength! talk of strength! These torments break the heart. Brave men are weak in painâthe bravest dread it. AREZZI. I do not yet. Misery is thus far goodâ It masters Fear. Savelli, speak of death. I would prepare with awe to die, as one That knows indeed how great a thing it is, Even where the best give back their souls to Him In whose sight none are guiltlessâhow much greater! When from the maddening struggles of this world, With all its devilish passions hot about themâ Pride, Envy, Vengeance, desperate Love, and Wrathâ Men sink, at once, like me! It is not Deathâ Or pain in passing to his restâif restâ That can affright me nowâbut what I am, And may be soon!âTeach me to pray, good father! Thy heart was spotless in this workâbut mine! SAVELLI. You may lie down and sleep without a sighâ As the tired infant slumbers after grief With tears upon its cheekâor else, your spirit Must pass to death through agony!âMy son Trust not this strength. AREZZI. How can I gain such rest? SAVELLI. Drink this, and sleep. AREZZI. What! poison? It is not poison? SAVELLI. The sin be mine, my son! if it be sin.â GERARDO. Women dare flee from Pain to Deathâand think His peace a blessing. AREZZI. I will face them both. GERARDO. Who, but the fool, with power to choose between them, Takes more than one? AREZZI. Art thou God's minister? Tempt me not, devilsâmine eyes are opened nowâ Savelli!âfiend! GERARDO. The coward!âhe dares not die! AREZZI. Not as the Iscariot diedâthough both were traitors! GERARDO. Thou slave! AREZZI. To-morrow I will answer that. SAVELLI. You will betray your friends. AREZZI. I have none, friar. I thought that I had one till now! The last Is dead alreadyâyou robbed me of the earliest. SAVELLI. Swear yet once more. AREZZI. I will notâI have promised. [Enter Provost with Officers. PROVOST. You must cut short your shrift. SAVELLI. Why so? GERARDO. For what? PROVOST. To go with me elsewhere. SAVELLI. Good Provostânot yet. PROVOST. Nay, but you shallâyour time is mineâgood friarâ Bring them along. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Night.âA Room in the Prison. Cimbelli chained and reading.âDuchess and Prince of Andria enter. PRINCE ANDRIA. (To the Guards.) Stand at the door, outsideâwait till we call.â We hope the book you study teaches wisdom. CIMBELLI. It doesâgrant me but time enough and health, I mean to pay it back, and write another. PRINCE ANDRIA. A book! good soothâit must be short.âOn what? CIMBELLI. We have ill usages in Spain and Naplesâ Gentile, unscriptural, barbarous, impious, devilishâ Customs abhorr'd, abjured, and quite swept out From lands less Christian than our own. In Spain Ye burn the living man, and here in Naples Torment him, rack him, rend him!âI have thoughts To show the manifold sin of what ye doâ Open your eyes, warn you against this evil, And serve you with my brains. PRINCE ANDRIA. We are much beholden! Hast ever pondered this before to-night? CIMBELLI. Believe me that I have, but lacked the leisure Which now your Grace has given me. I will ask The judgment of her highness too. DUCHESS. Yourself Will try, in part, the grievance that you treat of, And so be credited the moreâfor me, I did not make the laws, and must obey themâ Yet think of these with youâthey are what you say. CIMBELLI. Your Grace has mercy in your eyesâI saw Compassion toward the Count; and once you promised To love both him and me. DUCHESS. I did, Cimbelli. CIMBELLI. Now we will put it to the proof. DUCHESS. Talk wiselyâ Error is not rebellion. CIMBELLI. What I ask Squares well enough with both. DUCHESS. What is it then? CIMBELLI. Let me be hanged forthwithâ'tis no such matter For one so great as you to beg. The prince Designs me for the spitâhe loves old forms: I, as a soldier would be shot: the gibbet Is built in neutral ground 'twixt him and me; Adjust our difference, reconciles extremes; Stands like a guide-post where our wishes meet, And points a rough but speedy road to deathâ Confronts mine own ambition and his thoughts About midwayâit arbitrates for both, A honest sort of mediator, to make The compromise a fair one. If your Grace Has more than so much love, and would spare oneâ Arezzi is the youngestâhe may mend; I give my share to him. PRINCE ANDRIA. It is too late. DUCHESS. You should have thought upon his youth last night. PRINCE ANDRIA. He is beyond your power to help or harm. CIMBELLI. What, is he dead? PRINCE ANDRIA. Would that he had been so, When death were sad, not shameful! CIMBELLI. Murdered so soon? Most provident guardian of the young and desperate! You do your business suddenly, prince Andriaâ And now his lands are yours. Thou merciless butcher! Bind him, and cut his throat! The duke might find His pity by to-morrowâhe is young, Nor is his heart grown hard. The Count Arezzi Was his companion onceâhis play-fellowâ So you have lost no time!âMay God requite you. PRINCE ANDRIA. Peace, fool, I say. CIMBELLI. I wish my hands were loose, And then the fool would let his tongue be idleâ But now get out, or hear me to the end. Thou bloody, barbarous villain!âin prison and chains! Cruel, unnatural, treacherous, pitiless fiendâ I will not hold my peace. Beware this leopardâ You had compassion on the Countâso markâ Prince Andria is a traitorâwarn the duke; Tell him to keep a collar round his neck!â I know the savage better than ye bothâ He will devour you too. PRINCE ANDRIA. Blockheadâbe quiet! DUCHESS. These tears are signs of loveâ CIMBELLI. The south wind blind him! No eyes but his have ever seen my tearsâ Now let him light his fagots; if he force Another from my lids, or hear a prayer, It shall be for his sins. DUCHESS. Hush! hush!âCimbelliâ Remember what we are. CIMBELLI. I do remember What poor Arezzi was; and nothing else. 'Twas I that pushed and spurr'd him where he fell! His fault was too much love toward that thin wolfâ He would not let me send your devil below.â For youâI hope you keep your soul from bloodâ Else God forbid! I trust you knew not of it?â Tell me not what you are! Arezzi loved youâ He made us swear upon our knees to save youâ Preserve your honorsâguard and heal your peaceâ And while our conscience smote us for our folly, Faultered and boggled at an oath so vainâ He would take no part with usâbut abjured Our work and fellowship. DUCHESS. Dost speak the truth? CIMBELLI. You had no hand in this? I saw him weep At what he fancied would be grief to youâ Yet he could find no mercy! DUCHESS. Poor lost Arezzi! Unhappy as thou art! we drove thee outâ Our cold hard hearts were shut against our child! NayâAndriaâI will speak.âO! shame upon us! This stranger found and loved himâwe destroyed him! Now by my hopes of peace, I will be more Than thou canst dream for this. Speak out, Cimbelliâ Excuse his frailties with the truth, and tell His sufferings through the worldâso God shall judge me, The hand which lifts a finger to thy harm Had better grasp my throat!âto thee I will be All that I should have been to himâa mother! CIMBELLI. Then take that basilisk awayâhis looks Are death to Charity. PRINCE ANDRIA. Provost come inâ Unbind your prisoner thereâand when he bids it, Set the doors wideâhe is as free as we areâ Let no man question where he goes. [Cimbelli is unchainedâthe Guards retire. You wished Your hands were loose, Cimbelli, and now they are so. Go walk in Naples as ourselves. Last night Your sword was lostâtake this, (gives his sword)âbehold! young man, The father of Arezziânot his murderer. CIMBELLI. His what?âhis father?âart sure thou art his father?â And not the father of lies?âwho killed him then? DUCHESS. He is not killedâbe wise. CIMBELLI. You say so too? This is some train to set my fire a blazing.â DUCHESS. We love him as his parentsâboth. PRINCE ANDRIA. Thou saidst That when thy hands were free, thy tongue should rest. So keep it mute a minute, and hear me speak. Her highness and myself would gather upâ From that which once was wholeâsome rags of honor, And clothe against the bleak and pitiless world Arezzi's shame with these. He must go hence Where men may count his errors with his years, And sum the gross of bothâthink him a boy Ill-taught, ill-counselled, blinded, ignorant, desperate. DUCHESS. Speak what you know, Cimbelli,âwhat even now You told, with tears, to us. CIMBELLI. I ask two thingsâ Must I turn heathen first, and hang the rest In last night's buffet? PRINCE ANDRIA. When I gave my sword, It was to show my faithânot buy your treachery. CIMBELLI. The other I will forego. PRINCE ANDRIA. Let us have both. CIMBELLI. That message to the king thenâcome, 'twas wicked? Why wouldest thou have me burnt? PRINCE ANDRIA. What drunkard's dream Is this of burning? CIMBELLI. Faith! I walk in fogs, And may go wrong again!âthe brother I knowâ He is confessed and provedâas black as Erebusâ This ever was reputed goodâI see What makes me trust your Grace, and will do all Which leaves mine honor uncorrupt. PRINCE ANDRIA. Then haste, The duke by this expects us. Let us hear What some who think thee dead, may say about thee. I would not have thee seen at firstâbe hidden Till we shall bid thee speak. Come inâ(Guards enter) Here Marcoâ Lend us your cloak and capâstand close about him. CIMBELLI. Your staff too, friendâand button me to the nose.â Now we are fellows, brothers, guards to the dukeâ Strange mutabilities in mundane things! This masking had ill luck last night.âMarch on. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. A Hall in the Prison.âNight. Enter the Duke, Duchess, Cicilia, Prince of Andria, with Guards, and followed by some Officers of State. DUKE. It may be hardâgood cousin, to bothâbut yet With pangs like these must pride be rooted up. DUCHESS. Let him behold the pearl his wrath has trod onâ Sit down with us. DUKE. His mother herself endures All this to do him goodânow take your places. [They sit at a Table.âArezzi is brought in, chained. DUCHESS. Who bound these fetters on the Count? DUKE. What! Provostâ A noble, and uncondemned?âtake them awayâ(The chains are taken off.) They grieve him less than usâtrust me, Arezzi, We had no share in this. AREZZI. I thank your Grace. So much of courtesy might breed extremes And shame us bothâyour highness, in refusingâ Myself, in askingâmoreâand yet it is At last, scarce courtesy. DUKE. Tell me your wish. AREZZI. That what you mean to doâyou will do soonâ What you would know, ask now: your eyes are witnessâ There is no more to learnâlet me go hence. DUKE. I would do so, but must not yet.âGo whither? AREZZI. No matter where. I wish to lessen time, Not painâand shun, what grieves me worse than deathâ And not death tooâthese faces and your own. DUKE. They should awaken more than grief, Arezzi! AREZZI. If you remember what I was, or hope Yourself to be rememberedâsit not there With studious wisdom settled in your faceâ You and your queen to gaze! be like a king, And chuse some nobler kind of hate than this. Your questions cannot reach beyond myself. If torments must instruct these lips in treacheryâ I know my weakness, and will trust elsewhereâ Try them before you sleep. DUKE. O! God forbid! You shall think justly of us both. DUCHESS. For her, These tears must answer if she loves theeâthankless! She is not, and she never was unfaithful. DUKE. A queen! she might have beenâbut love though cruel, Outweighed two kingdoms, and Arezzi still Is more than sovereignty. DUCHESS. She gave her promiseâ And kept her faith, to you and me, Arezziâ I trusted, you did not. AREZZI. My prayer was heard! The other half will follow. DUKE. You wronged me too. DUCHESS. This child! prince Andria's innocent!âHe who sends His nurse to choose his wife!âwas thus far manlyâ He threw the arms which Fortune gave aside, Put by his power, unrobed himself of greatness, Forgot the privilege of his place, and stood Fairlyâas far as will could make it evenâ On level ground before you. When he failed, He did not hate his conqueror. DUKE. Ask herselfâ You will believe Cicilia now. AREZZI. I do. A greater error lessens shame for this, Which yet is shameful. PRINCE ANDRIA. There are more than theseâ Greater than both! you will not think them soâ But he who cleanses what were else corrupt, And may impute no sin to love like yoursâ Commands a purer service, calls it duty, And makes his peace its blessing. DUCHESS. Tell us now If Andria and myself, in twenty years, Were less than parents to you? PRINCE ANDRIA. When we erred, Was it through want of love? DUCHESS. You should have felt No less than may become a child toward us. PRINCE ANDRIA. O! but we changed of lateâfrowned on your hopes, Lessened our bounties, and for what we did, Made will and power the prologues! DUCHESS. Alas! Arezziâ Faith is too slow of growth for twenty years! Distrust can root itself, wax gross, and bear Its fruits to ripeness in a month!âWe could notâ Till Ferdinand had renounced his love, the king Had sent forgiveness to myself and Andriaâ We dared not tell you what you are. AREZZI. What am I? DUCHESS. Our son. AREZZI. Your son! DUCHESS. Those whose place you struck at, Were, what they are, in blood as well as fondness, Your father, mother, cousins. AREZZI. Have mercyâGod! Save me from this! DUCHESS. Such tears become my child. We too have erredâand will reproach no more. You shall embrace your mother. AREZZI. O, no, noâ Shame never found a place near breasts like yours, Nor must it now. There is a curse above us; Sorrow and danger fall on all who love me, And all I loveâonly thus far forgiveâ If it were yours, recal it. (He kneels, and rests his head on the table.) PRINCE ANDRIA. Bring these friars. [Savelli and Gerardo are brought in. What led you here last night?âdo you speak first. SAVELLI. My duty, prince. PRINCE ANDRIA. Your office then is dangerous. SAVELLI. It is, but urgent. PRINCE ANDRIA. Does it nourish rebels? SAVELLI. It comforts all, but most the fallen and guilty. PRINCE ANDRIA. We know your charity. SAVELLI. Your highness knows More than you love or practise then! I am Confessor to the Count, I was his tutorâ And, feeble as I may be in myself, The Churches servant shall perform her will, If princes chide or not. PRINCE ANDRIA. Thou insolent priest! The Church disclaims a traitor. SAVELLI. In her name, I scorn his lie who calls me such. The Count May tremble, but he knows the truthâdoes he Perjure his soulâand for a life of shame, Impute to me his treasons? Arezzi (rising.) I do notâ SAVELLI. Hear thatâand one as noble as yourselfâ Too poor, indeed, to be a proud man's brotherâ But yet, your father's son. Speak what thou knowest. GERARDO. I will. PRINCE ANDRIA. You shall be called on soon, and then May answer for yourselfâwe have your billetsâ We know your messagesâSavelli first Must meet his brethren here, whose backs may bring Their abbey's chest untired. GERARDO. Ah! thus it isâ Time never mollifies! Before they hear us, Our next in bloodâwhose cradle was our ownâ Whose flesh and bones are oursârise up against us! Savelli knows me what I am, and not What I may once have beenâdo I speak truth? Should I be trusted, brother? SAVELLI. Both. GERARDO. Why thenâ As there is hope of better worlds than thisâ Thou art a traitor.âWhat dost gaze at, man? I do not fear to speak my words twice o'erâ A cruel, cozening, barbarous, devilish traitor! Thou hast betrayed thy friend, ensnared the guiltless, Made me a blind partaker in thy knaveryâ This thou hast doneâshame on thee, hypocrite! Andria may trust me now. SAVELLI. Thou double-faced fiend! GERARDO. Go onârevile, accuse, eat thine own words, Warn all against belief!âthe snare is broken, And like a frighted bird, I spread my wings Where truth shall be my resting place.âWhat was I? A carrier of his billets! message-bearer! A runner to and fro in frauds and treasons? Were these the treasurer's alms? his charities? His debts and dues?âO! fie, fie, fie! PRINCE ANDRIA. Stop nowâ And tell us if it were your office too Which brought you here last night? GERARDO. Brother! it was My love toward that bad man; false pity, fear, Amazement, and the credit of our house Now lost! quite gone! Behold him wild with haste, Half-choked, like one pursued, distraught, possessed, And bellowing where I layâO! help me, save me!â He kneels beside my bedâand looks behindâ Attests the spiritual fellowship between usâ And by our common vows, adjures my pityâ Tells me this treason in the Count, and shows Some knowledge near to guilt: through me, perchance, As brother to the princeâthese doors may openâ Arezzi must be silenced. Half awake I rise and follow himâbut, ye saints above! What plots! what snares!âhow many oaths and curses! Fierce vows, relentless wishes, bloody hopes, And lamentations o'er abortive crime!â Yesâboth of them repentâbut what? that murder Had not been tried more secretly.âOne owns His trust betrayed, the abbey's treasury spent To fee conspiracy. DUKE. This was your friend For whom you testified so much? whose grace Shone like a glory round him? He was learned In all good studies, but the most in those Which lead to godliness! GERARDO. What does this prove? Your Grace reminds me wellâwhat does it prove? Marryâwhat else but that I loved the man, And did believe him faithful? He has blinded One wiser than myselfâmy brother there. SAVELLI. Answer this slave, Arezzi. AREZZI. When I swore, It was to both. GERARDO. Now will your highness hear! There was an oath thenâdo I lie or not? Savelli tendered poison to the Countâ He has it in his bosom stillâby this My words are verified. PRINCE ANDRIA. Take it awayâ [Savelli takes out the poison, and drinks it. DUKE. Lay hold upon the friar!âtoo late! GERARDO. No matterâ 'Tis poison I know. SAVELLI. I leave him to your Graceâ May all believe and trust him! PRINCE ANDRIA. Till last night You never heard of this conspiracy? GERARDO. Neverâtill late last night. Hold there, one moment! Let me be sureâgood soothâI said too much! I do bethink me of an iron-tongued praterâ The zany of some mountebank decayedâ What was it that they called his name?âa patch With perilous impudence, brimful of lies Which bubbled from him daily all day long, And yet were never spentâa traveller's book Where every nation's folly found its place, And all mens' sins, a recordâOne who had No soul to be ashamed ofâso no shame. He was Arezzi's counsellor, till his skull Split on the palace stairs last nightâI think They called the knaveâCimbelli. AREZZI. Slanderous liar! Beware to tempt me furtherâthis Cimbelli Was noble, if nobility be truth, And good, if what is faithful lean from evil!â Yet thou dost wellâhe was the impostor's scourge, And hypocrites abhorr'd him. DUCHESS. Peace, awhileâ What more of this Cimbelli? GERARDO. May I speak?â So! mercy on us! need these traitors patience!â The ape we talk about, now two days gone, Came where I could not shun him, held me fast And saidââWe shall require your prayers, and you âMay then leave off to pray. The prince, your brother, âMust turn into a monk instead, yourself âShall be a prince.â I smiled upon the sot And asked him, when? he answered, âWhen the duke âIs Count Arezzi's subject, and the Count âBecomes a king.ââI do not chide with drunkards, So bade him go and sleep. PRINCE ANDRIA. Where is Cimbelli? [Cimbelli throws aside his cloak and cap, and comes forward. AREZZI. Cimbelli! CIMBELLI. Ay, Cimbelliâwho has heardâ Despite the proverb of a listener's fortunesâ Some good about himself at last. He kept His peace with much ado. Behold me, father, One of his highness' guardsâa man in trust; The prince your brother gave his zany thisâ [Shows his sword. Dost take me for my ghost?âprithee leave staringâ He did not mean to burn meâwhat thou saidst Of letters written by his Grace to Spain, Then signed and sealed by theeâwas fanciful. The Inquisitors have other fish to fry. Let the prince live!âbesides, why should we kill him? His lands and honors cannot fall to thee: He is provided with an heirâArezzi Is nephew to your reverence, and his son. PRINCE ANDRIA. You hear the truthâwhat else? SAVELLI. Let me speak once. The darkness gathers round meâI would die With one sin lessâArezzi fell through treacheryâ Beware Gerardo, prince!âGive me some help; Trust not that scorpionâmercyâO!âno mercy! [He falls and is carried out. PRINCE ANDRIA. Take him away. PROVOST. He points, and tries to speak. GERARDO. Is this your son indeed? PRINCE ANDRIA. Get thee henceâCain! GERARDO. Andria, we both must goâand childless bothâ We leave no heirs behind us. [He takes a dagger from his breast and stabs Arezzi. Half is done! Now, brother, for thyself. DUCHESS. Lay hold upon himâ [As Gerardo passes round the table to Prince Andriaâ Cimbelli strikes him with his sword, and throws him down. CIMBELLI. Incarnate devil!âcanst die? your sword, prince Andria, Has done its master service! CICILIA. Look, he bleedsâ Save himâbring help! AREZZI. It is not much. DUCHESS. Child, child! PRINCE ANDRIA. Look up and speak, my son. CIMBELLI. Courage, Arezzi! He struck but once, bear ye that carcase outâ [To the Guards. It grins with mischief still. AREZZI. Let me lie down. CICILIA. Will no one stop this blood! he bleeds to deathâ There is no help, no pity! AREZZI. I deserve noneâ And least of all from youâyet have I loved To guilt and madnessâyou will pardon now? CICILIA. O! do not speak of pardonâall need pardon! It is imperfect love that can forgiveâ Mine never felt but grief. PRINCE ANDRIA. Look! the blood stops! CICILIA. We may be happy yet. AREZZI. O! never, never!â The pardoned traitor happy! I have brought Shame on yourself, and these. DUCHESS. Good God! good God! Make me be patientâI would learn to sufferâ Yet now be merciful! AREZZI. It was his mercy I did not die last nightâhe never blesses Him whom a father loves, yet cannot bless! PRINCE ANDRIA. We both have blessed thee, childâ AREZZI. Come near, Cimbelliâ For my sake serve my motherâraise me higher, So, I feel strength and less in painâthis blood Which drains my heart, still leaves its guilt behind! DUCHESS. Hush, hush! we call not ignorance, guiltâand error May end in peace. AREZZI. No error leads to thisâ It makes us not ungrateful! Let men call me The parricide Arezzi! I have been Opinion's fool too long. Yourselves, my parentsâ Ah! better never known as such, than nowâ Will fear to grieve while sorrow looks like sin! Go, wash your handsâand say that God is justâ He strikes the guilty! One will pity still, Whose meekness has endured so much, and borne Distrust, reproach, unkindness! Let the rest Forget me, or abhor meâI shall find A place where all things else are good and pure, For long remembranceâpromise this, Cicilia. CICILIA. I do. AREZZI. Forgive meâO! those lips once moreâ They make death easierâall is silence hereâ Speak to meâdo not leave meâlove me stillâ Forgive the ungratefulâspeakâgood God! just God! [Dies.
