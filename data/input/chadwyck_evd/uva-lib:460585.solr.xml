      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.âHall of a castle in the Highlands of Scotland. An oaken staircase on one side of the hall leads to the open door of a corridor. The hall is hung with banners and old Scottish weapons. Pointed windows. Through the high and spacious archway of door open at back, placed towards side, almost diagonally, are seen, first a narrow stretch of land, then a lake which it borders. The slopes of mountains descend beyond the lake on each side. Within the hall Ursula is at her wheel spinning. A group of hunters approach, and are heard singing the following chorusâ We followed the stag o'er strath and hill, From the breaking of the day; We chased him through covert, up crag, until At noon he stood at bay. He stood at bay in the torrent's foam, And ere the sunset we brought him home. As the singing becomes audible, Ursula ceases to spin, and remains motionless. The hunters then appear, some of them bearing the slain stag upon their shoulders. They pass the archway repeating the chorus till their voices are lost in the distance. Sunset is visible through the archway. Urs. [Rising and placing her wheel on one side.] Again the sun, like a spent warrior, drops His flag of fire on the lake's breast, and dies. The fifth night, yet no news. They must have met Ere thisâmy brother, and his brave Macronalds, And Murdoch, who leads on our mortal foes, The fell Mackanes. Enter Roderick, an old Clansman. Roderick, are those returned You sent for tidings to the pass? Rod. Returned From a vain quest. Urs. Still vain! 'Tis now five days Since the Mackanes hung on yon mountain's slope, Scarce an hour's march hence. In a night my brother Summoned his force to meet themâmust have met them In strife ere this. Rod. Spoke I not truth to Angus? I said, âBeware of the cat's stealthy windings. Those posted on the slope are but decoys Who seek to lure you onward to their land, Where toil and hunger, fighting on their side, Shall harm you more than steel.â Your brother reck'd not; The lion's heart, with a child's brain to guide it, Still urged him on; and now, perchance, ensnared, He vainly struggles, while I, Iâgrown oldâ A toothless mastiff dozing in the sunâ Must no more from the loosen'd leash bound forth On my chief's foe, and shake him by the throat! No; I'm no longer Roderick! Urs. Nay, staunch heart! The watchdog, like the bloodhound, has his use. I know, did danger threat your chief's sole child, My fair niece Lilian, you would find your tusks. Rod. Thou say'st it, honoured dame. Methinks for her Even these old gums would bite. Our Lady Lilian, Our pride! nay more, our help! who, with the skill In herbs and surgery she early gained, Nursed me when wounded, tending all my needs As she had been my daughter! Urs. Ah! she loves Better to staunch a wound than pay its due To the bold hand that gave it. Rod. Ay; she has lived Till lately in a convent, where the sisters, As is their pious trade, feed scrupulous souls With saws of peace and mercy; wholesome fare For mewed-up women, and sick, bedridden men. Yes, there's a time for all things, for repentance And mercy 'mong the rest. They're good, no doubt, When the priest mumbles shrift, and one about To quit this world must give up his old likings To earn the next. Nay, nay, this mood will pass. Our eaglet, 'scap'd her nun's cage, will by instinct Learn the great swoop that fits Clanronald's brood! Look, look! her barge makes land even now. [A boat is seen at back, gliding up the lake. The boat stops in centre of archway, and Lilian and Margery come on shore. The boatmen doff their bonnets to Lilian, and row on out of sight. Roderick advances to meet Lilian. Lil. [Divesting herself of her mantle.] Good Margery, Take thou this mantle. [She gives it to her. Margery curtsies, and passes out at a side door. Rod. Daughter of Macronald, Welcome! thrice welcome! Lil. Thanks, thanks, Roderick. What tidings of my father? Rod. None. Urs. None. Lil. Strange! You to the glen sent, and I now return From where the witch's craig commands the lake. Heaven guard my father and the clan of Ronald! Oh, had I been his son, still to be found At his right hand in danger! Urs. A daughter, though she fight not, well may aid Her father's cause. You are of age to marry. The nephew of the Cameron sought your hand; If you had wed him, you had gained your clan A strong ally. Lil. A crafty one, who sows Strife 'twixt his neighbours that himself may thrive Upon their loss. Well for us if the Camerons Prove not our peril one day! Rod. Shrewdly said. Urs. There's young Macleod, the cousin of the chief, Him you repulsed. Lil. Macleod! He has flaxen hair And a hand like a woman's; then he plays The harp. The hand I take shall never finger Harp-strings, but do the deeds that harp-strings echo. [The sunset has disappeared. A rather misty twilight comes on. A servant enters with a lighted torch, which he strikes into floor by mantel-piece: he then goes out. Rod. Thou hast a face to win men, and thou know'st it. Lil. Ay, Roderick, ever since a child, I saw That face reflected in your polished shield, And to myself said, âLilian's a beauty! She's very much like dear Aunt Ursula.â [Throwing her arms round Ursula's neck. Urs. Yes, you know how to fool one. But say, Lilian, If you refuse all strangers, why not wed One of your clansmen? Malcolm long has wooed you. Lil. My cousin? Oh, he's grave beyond his age. I do not like a year without a spring, Nor manhood without youth. Urs. You scorned no less Your distant kinsman Hector. Rod. Oh, she scorns Them all in turn. Yet Hector's handsome. Lil. Fierce And handsomeâtiger-like. I want a man. Urs. What fault has Duncan? Lil. Duncan has red hair. Rod. Is that a fault? Lil. A grievous fault to have The roof of his brain in conflagration, yet Within no spark of light or fire to cause it. Duncan's a simple fool. Urs. Well, then, young David? Lil. [With a laugh.] Oh, David has black hair. Rod. [Drily.] You like not black, Nor red, nor flaxenânor the shades between? Lil. Ah, Roderick! 'tis the wearer, not the hair, That's hard to fancy. Give me, then, a man Who has the love of song like young Macleod, Yet knows war's trade like Hector; fresh with youth Like David, yet in counsel sage as Malcolm; With Duncan's faith, and yet without his folly; And that particular shade of hair that suits me; And thenâ Rod. Well, then? Lil. I'll look at the man twice Ere I say, Go your way; but would he win My heart, indeed, let him be brave, as is My father, yet respect a noble foe; And, if he vanquish, spare him. Urs. Spare a foe! Next to her hope of heaven a chieftain's daughter Should love her clan; next to perdition, hate Its enemies! Lil. I hate all wrong, and all Who work wrong while they work it. Rod. While they work it. No âwhiles,â child! Hate's the cordial wine that warms The heart; but âwhilesâ and âifsâ are the mere water That mars the draught and thins the drinker's blood. Give me hate neat! I like not drink diluted. Lil. Nay, Roderick, well did Abbess Hilda teach That we, who all offend, should mercy show To those who share our taint. [Sits at table. Urs. The convent's prate Where thou wast bred. Rod. [To Lilian.] Think of your cause to loathe The clan Mackane! Urs. [To Lilian.] A husband's death I owe them; And you a mother's! she my brother's wife. [Severely.] Have you forgot the tale? Recall and muse on it. In such a month as this, when such a twilight As deepens now had fallen, your father absent With all brave hearts that rallied to his war-cry, These wolves his warrior eye had like a torch Scared back into their woods, besieged our hold. Your mother, then about to bear that name, Lay helpless in her chamber, when the glare Of flames (for with a belt of fire Mackane Had girt our walls) laughed redly at her casement! By Mary's grace, a royal force on march Drove back the assailants; quenched the spreading flames! But she, who shuddering in that chamber lay, Hands clenched, lips locked in fear, her upturned gaze Fixed on the reddening sky, with scarce a moan Gave to our house a new lifeâLilian, thineâ And breathed her own to heaven! Recall that tale! Lil. [Absorbed.] What had it been to have known a mother! Urs. [With awe.] It was not so to be. Before she passed, Thou know'st she saw distinct the fatal shape Of that fierce Graham whom your ancestor In sudden quarrel slew; since when, the phantom We know as Graham's wraith has still appeared To tell our race of danger or of death! Lil. I would you had not named him. Urs. Why? Lil. Because But three nights since I saw him! Urs. Saw him? Lil. Ay, As you have oft portrayed him; by my bed He stood, or seemed to stand, with gaze intent, And long black hair that like a half-rent veil Disclosed the fearful secret of his brow, Frowning and pallid! From his bosom gashed, One hand drew down the plaid and bared to sight His gory wound; the other bore his sword, Which pointed back, as beckoning me to follow; While o'er his death-struck aspect flitted slow A smile of triumph which, having passed, the shapeâ As though it lived but in the evil light Of that strange smileâpassed with it! Urs. Nay! [The spectre of Graham's wraith appears dimly through the archway in the mist which has deepened, and which now dissolves and shows the light of the moon. The moonlight is soft and subdued. The spectre becomes gradually distinct, and in all respects resembles the description given of it in preceding dialogue. Lil. [Rising.] I saw it, Plain as that wall, that shield, or yonderâ [Turning to archway, she perceives the spectre, and stands arrested. Ursula and Roderick, to whom the spectre remains invisible, also rise. Urs. Lilian! Rod. Has fancy Raised to her o'erwrought sense, the thing she feared? Lil. [To spectre.] I know thee, phantom! If, dread shape, thy summons Be unto me, fresh chapleted with hopes And half-blown joys of youth, may heaven forgive The victim's blemish, and accept her life! If for those near unto my heart thou com'st, Or other ill dost to our house portend, Heaven's mercy shield us! To its will, not thine, Spirit of vengeance, I commit myself! See, see! the smile fades from his face, and with it He fades! [The spectre vanishes.] Gone! all is air! He was, and is not! [Faintly, and sinking on a chair. Rod. Courage! you looked on nought. Urs. Imagination Is wont to breed such shows. Lil. And you saw nothing? Urs. Nothing. Lil. 'Tis strange! most strange! [Suddenly.] What sound was that? Hark! hark! It comes again! It swells! The tumult Of fight, the clash of arms, the clansman's war-cry! Urs. There's no such sound. Rod. [Goes up to archway.] I hear none. Lil. You will hear. Hector appears at archway, followed by two armed Clansmen guarding Kenelm, and by two or three Retainers. Hec. [To Clansmen.] See to that boy, my prisoner, straightway guard him. [Clansmen bear off Kenelm by side door. The Retainers remain in the hall. Urs. You, Hector? say, what tidings? Hec. The Mackanesâ Near you, and poised to swoop upon your nestâ Are by your brother and our clan o'ertaken; Almost within your hearing they contend. I through the fight cut way to bear you warning. You, Roderick, for the women's safety care; For me, my place is in the field; farewell! [Rushes out. Rod. [To Retainers.] Follow him, you, and with what speed you may Bring tidings of the fight! [Retainers hurry out after Hector. Huntsmen and servants pass the archway, and follow them with torches. Let's hope the better fate; but for the worse Be still prepared. A boat lies by the shore; At once, then, cross the lake and 'scape your foes! Lil. [To Ursula.] Heed him, and follow! Haste! my almost mother. Farewell! Rod. [To Lilian.] And you? Lil. [Apart to him.] Macronald's child, when foes invade his hearth, May die there, but not quit it! [She takes her stand upon the hearthstone. Urs. That's my place! You are young, and, should they conquer, you brave death, Or worse than death! Lil. For death I am prepared; And worse than death I can prevent. [She takes a dagger from old armour which surmounts mantel-piece, and conceals it beneath her plaid. The shouts of the combatants, mingled with the notes of the pipes, are now heard faintly in the distance. Rod. Hist! Now You catch the shout! [After a pause, sounds repeated.] Strike home, brave Angus! would I could strike with you! [The shouts and notes of the pipes, though still distant, become more distinct. At length the cry, âCraig Eagalach!â âCraig Eagalach!â is remotely heard. Urs. 'Twas a single war-cry. Lil. Whose? Again! [The cry, âCraig Eagalach!â âCraig Eagalach!â becomes still more distinct. Rod. It is but one shout, and that shout our own! âCraig Eagalach!ââthe Rock of Terrorâyes, The fight is o'er. [To Lilian.] Your father comes a victor! [Triumphant music from the pipes of the Clanronald is now heard near. Suddenly the notes of triumph are exchanged for low wailing music. Urs. Why sink those notes of triumph to a wail? Rod. They come! they come! Enter, preceded by servants with torches and others, the pipers and standard-bearer of the Macronalds, the latter bearing a flag with the crest, device of a castle, surmounted by a hand grasping a sword, and having above the motto, âMy hope is constant in thee.â They are followed by Malcolm, Hector, Torquil, and many other of the Macronalds. Malcolm, Hector, Torquil, and one or two others, as kinsmen of the chief, wear each an eagle's feather in his bonnet. The general body wear in their bonnets heath the badge of the Macronalds. Some carry double-edged swords, targets, and daggers, others the same (targets excepted) with the addition of bows and arrows. The low wail from bagpipes continues till all have entered. Urs. Speak, Malcolm, Torquil, speak! Victory is yours we know, but at what cost? [Hector retires, and goes out at side door. Musicians retire at back, and await the body of Angus. Mal. What woe these sounds lament too soon, too soon Shall grieve your ears. But take our whole brief story.â As you guessed, Roderick, the foemen's line, Seen on yon hills, was meant but to decoy. The scanty band retreating, lured us on Into their hostile land! At length young Davidâ Hector's dear foster-brotherâwith the ardour Of nineteen summers, darted from our ranks And neared the foe, who then, with sudden onset, Closed round and seized him! Not his youth nor courage Touched their fierce hearts. A dozen daggers gleamed, And in the stripling's bosom found their sheaths! Heaven forget me, if ever I forget That white and beardless face! Lil. O wolves, not men! Mal. Still hold you firm; this grief a greater heralds, That bids all listeners stand unbonneted For a dead king on his bier! O, ask not words; Think what our clan holds its best strengthâits prideâ Even that we lack! Rod. Cease, raven! Say thou speak'st not Of Angus, of our chief? Lil. Not of my father? Mal. [To Lilian.] Cousin, too true, too true, your father's dead! Lil. Dead, say you? Then of his fate, not of mine, The spectre warned me. Father! [Sits absorbed in grief. Urs. Say, how fell he? Mal. With feet by vengeance winged, on David's murderers We rushed, and at the sword's edge forced confession That their chief strength was marching on our home. Swift we pursued, and where the misty moon Showed our old tower, o'ertook them, when a shaftâ A cursed shaftâstruck noble Angus down! Rod. My chief! And I live on! Urs. Farewell, my brother! Thou diedst as should my brother! Mal. We avenged him; For like a crag, that, loosened from its height, Rings down the echoing slope, we burst upon them! Before the shock they fled. To us returned, Falls the sad task to tell you of that loss Which we share with you. Urs. Nephew, thanks! For me, I'll to my chamber. Lilian! [Lilian rises. Roderick takes a torch from an attendant, and ushers Ursula and Lilian, whom Ursula supports, to the foot of the staircase leading to corridor. Mal. [To Ursula and Lilian.] May all saints Have you in keeping! Upon me unworthy Now lights the state of chief; command me ever. Cousin and aunt, good night! [Malcolm and Clansmen bow with deep reverence, while Ursula, preceded by Roderick with torch, and followed by Lilian, begin to ascend staircase. Re-enter, from side door, Hector, dragging Kenelm, who wears the Mackane plaid and a sprig of holly in his cap. Hec. A prize! a prize! My prize! Mal. What slip is this, That in our sight doth bear the holly badge Of the Mackanes? [Ursula, preceded by Roderick, disappears in corridor. Lilian, arrested by the sight of Kenelm and by the tumult, remains on staircase. Hec. While through their land we pressed, I, smit with thirst, entering a cottar's house, Chanced on this boy, charge of a crone with whom, For more concealment while his kin were absent, His father placed him! But his look and garb Spoke the lad's rank. I bore him off; but when I and my fellows following gained our rear, The fight was hottest. Natheless, through the strife We held the boy in guard, and hither brought him. 'Tis Murdoch's son, chief of the clan Mackane: He has confessed it. Tor. and Clansmen. [Fiercely.] Murdoch's son! Mal. [Sternly to Kenelm.] Thy name? [Kenelm shrinks back. Hec. He weeps. His father has caused tears enough. Mal. Quickly, thy name? [Kenelm is silent. Tor. He fears or shames to speak it. Ken. Thou liest! I am the son of Murdoch, chief Of the Mackanes. 'Tis thou, not I, would fear, Dog of Macronald, were my father by! Hec. There spoke his father's son. Malcolm, remember Young David murdered, my loved foster-brother, Whose fresh wounds cry, âRevenge!â Let that revenge Reach all Mackanes through him! [Pointing to Kenelm. Tor. Ay, son for son! And blood for blood! Clansmen. 'Tis just! Mal. Ye say so? Tor., Hec., and other Clansmen. All! Lil. [Who has descended staircase, and advanced to the front.] Malcolm, what horror's this? Mal. Thou here? retire! This is no place for women. Lil. Yes; where'er The helpless cry for mercy, and man heeds not, There is the place for women! Hec. Did his tribe Show our young David mercy? Mal. No; he fell A living target pierced with daggers! Cowards! A score against a boy! Hec. [Pointing to Kenelm.] He dies! Tor. and other Clansmen. He dies! Ken. [To Lilian.] Can pity for my fate flow in thy veins? Mal. Wouldst thou, an orphan, spare their ruthless seed Who made thee such? Your father, girl, had crushed it. Lil. Thou dost defame him, Malcolm; and his blood, Which flows direct in me as doth a stream From a hid spring, doth tell thee thou defam'st him! [She seizes Kenelm's hand. Clansmen on each side advance to obstruct her passage. My father, didst thou say? With him a man, Armed to the teeth, ran danger; but a woman And child were safe, being helpless. [These words produce some impression on all except Hector. So with you; [To Malcolm. So with you all. [To Clansmen. Macronalds, hear your sister! Hec. Fall ye to doubt? Lady, our chief has spoken. [He advances to seize Kenelm. Lil. [Withdrawing Kenelm.] Back! I am daughter of your dead chief Angus! Command him back! [To Malcolm. Hector turns to Malcolm as for orders. Mal. [To Lilian.] Thou know'st my will. Retire, Let go that hand. Lil. Not till some savage grasp Wrench it from mine! There's no such here! [Taking flag from standard-bearer.] See, Malcolmâ See allâthe banner of our race! Who looks Upon these folds, nor feels a clansman's pride? These folds, that, ever first in danger's track, Waved heroes on! If by this deed ye stain Your glorious flag, no more wear swords, but henceforth Whet knives for shambles. I, for one, abjure Macronald's name, and at my shrinking feet Cast your loathed colours! Shall I? Speak? [Seeing Roderick, who descends staircase with torch. Ah, Roderick! Thou art a soldier. Take and shield this boy! [She gives Kenelm to Roderick and confronts Clansmen. Mal. [With admiration.] A true Macronald! [Torquil and most of the Clansmen, but not Hector, signify assent, exclaiming, 'Tis Angus' daughter! Mal. Yes; her father's soul Looks from her eyes! [To Clansmen.] Brothers, I may not spurn A prayer so urged; the first prayer from the lips Of Angus' child. [To Hector.] Doubt not we'll take revenge, Signal, it may be nobler, for slain David. [To Lilian.] Cousin, you have prevailed, the boy shall live, But on these terms, or else he forfeits mercy, That he no longer bears his people's name, [A movement of indignation from Kenelm, which Lilian represses, and again takes his hand. Who shall not deem he lives; and that he rest, Guarded within our power, so to be dealt with By us as we by them. Thus much we grant Your father's child. [A wail of the pipes is heard from musicians at back. List! from the field they bear His corse, the clay that once was Angus! [The wail is renewed. Roderick takes flag from Lilian. A friar advances by torchlight through archway at the head of a few clanspeople and domestics, including women and children of both sexes, who precede and surround the body of Angus. The group divide in front, and discover the body of Angus on a bier, the arms folded on the breast, the hands closed on a sword. The wail continues. All Clansmen uncover and bend in reverence. Lil. [Advancing in solemn grief to the body and kneeling, her arm round Kenelm, who also uncovers and bends.] Father!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.âThe Convent of St Catherine. An apartment overlooking at back, through open window, a terrace practicable, and garden doors on each side. Lilian, dressed in slight mourning, and working at embroidery, is seated; she pauses in her work, and sits awhile abstracted. Margery, who stands by her side, draws skeins from a work-bag. Mar. Surely the hand of imp or fay has ravell'd The skeins here, red, gold, blue; one tangled knot! [To Lilian.] Did you say blue next? was it blue or gold? You have not heard me, madam! Gold or blue? Lil. Oh, either. [Correcting herself.] Gold; then blue. Mar. There's gold, then. [Laying gold skein on table.] Yes, 'Tis trueâthat which I told youâall is stir And preparation. The young knight departsâ Madam, there's blue. [Laying blue skein on table.] That he departs at all Is due to you who healed him. Lil. [Mildly.] Margery, You've said that oft. Mar. Well, I shall scarcely miss The good knight or his followers. All kind powers Be praised, we quit this convent! Not a word, Or even a look, allowed 'twixt us Macronalds And those who serve Sir Oscar! True, they're French, And, had we met, we scarce by words had guessed Each other's thoughts. But then one's eyes can speak, Though one's tongue fail. Lil. Thy tongue, dear Margery, Will scarce break down. I love to hear thee talk; But now my task needs pains, and I must fix My thoughts on it. Leave me, good Margery. Mar. [Laying down work-bag, and glancing at Lilian's work.] You must work hard to end it ere 'tis Lammas. [Margery goes out by one of the side doors. Lil. To-day! He goes at noonâan hour and all Will be as though it had not been. Not so; Things we call past live on in their effects. Enter Roderick and Kenelm from garden. Kenelm wears no plaid or tartan of any kind, nor badge in his bonnet (which is a different one, as should be seen, from that of 1st Act), but a blue scarf. He is nearly a year older than in 1st Act. Ken. [Who carries a foil rebated at the point.] Now, Roderick, to't again; up with thy staff! [Menacing him in sport with foil Rod. Give breathing-time; remember that my joints Are rusty. Now then! Ken. [Who, attacking, is parried by Roderick's staff.] By St David, thou Hast eye and arm yet! What! thy joints want oil? They're lithe as mine. Again! [Kenelm again attacks, and is again parried.] Once more; have at thee! [He again attacks, and this time touches Roderick with foil. Rod. So, Well planted! there you hit. Ken. [Laughing.] You let me do it. But I am now fifteen. Come three years more, I'll hit without your letting. Rod. Whipster! [Laughs, and pats him on the head. Lil. [Looking up.] Roderick! Rod. I came for your commands. Do you still propose To quit St Catherine's and your friend the abbess So soonâto-morrow? Lil. Yes; my cousin Malcolm Sends, as you know, to urge my swift return. 'Tis thought the Camerons will soon break forth In open strife. Rod. Ay, now their chief unmasks And shows a threatening front, both to our clan And the Mackanes. Lil. Did I not tell thee once 'Twas Cameron's art to thrive on other's loss? Rod. As the wolf bears the prey from two spent lions. Ken. Does Cameron threat my clan? Rod. Not less than ours. [Kenelm sits moodily. 'Tis fixed, then; at what hour do you set forth, To-morrow? [To Lilian. Lil. At an hour past dawn. Sit, Roderick. [Roderick sits. Lilian aside, falling into reverie. He goes at noon. Were his brief words last night Meant for a farewell? Shall we meet no more? Rod. [To Lilian.] I' faith, I shall be glad to see once more Our castle walls. [In a louder tone, observing that she does not reply.] I say these few weeks spent 'Neath Abbess Hilda's roof will stay my hunger For convent life. Lil. [Who has roused herself.] To me they have seemed brief. You know that I was bred here, and the abbess Was loved of my aunt Ursula. Rod. A lady, Most mourned and honoured, who too early joined Your father in the grave. Lil. Ay, aunt and father Lost in one year. This month it counts a year Since my brave father fell. Then Ursula, To others stern, to me most gentle, followed. Thus pass the friends of old; and new friends! They, too, Come but to vanish! [Again in reverie. Ken. [Impetuously to Roderick.] Dost thou say the Cameron Threatens my father. Hence, toy! [Throwing down the foil.] Vain to learn The sword's use, if I draw it not for him! Rod. Wouldst thou be safe, forget him. Ken. At that price I'd not be safe. Mark, Roderick; dog my steps And mesh me as you will, I'll some day 'scape, For I will see my father. Rod. Peace! such words Might risk your life. Those in your lady's train Assigned to guard you have quick eyes and ears. Ken. [Again impetuously.] Would I were free! Lil. What, wouldst thou leave me, Kenelm? Ken. Lilian, you know I love you. I would make You and my father friends. I'd tell my tale; And then, if stern to all Macronalds else, He'd let me call you sister. I'd return Of my free will. Free! How I envy all things That no chain bindsâbirds lessening up the sky, And winds that sweep on shouting! Would I were hawk, Or horse, or hound. Ah! would I were the knightâ The stranger knight Sir Oscar! I had borne His wounds and sickness if, like him restored, I might to-day ride forth. Rod. He goes to-day? Ken. Knew you not that? Rod. And he goes sound and whole, Thanks, lady, to your skill; though scarce a month since Borne to this convent, faint with wounds, he lay In sorest peril. To your healing hand And patient care this stranger owes a gift No less than life. Ken. [To Lilian.] Sets he not forth at noon? Was't not at noon? [Aloud to her, with mischievous significance. But say, what keeps you thus so grave and brooding? Lil. Brooding! I, Kenelm? Ken. You. Rod. The lad is right. [Scrutinising her. Methinks you should be blithe and proud to know Your patient leaves you cured. Ken. Ay, there's the riddle. When the knight lay in danger, Lilian's step Was quick, her eye was bright; but as he grew In strength, so she in gloom. Her hands are idle Even as her tongue; see how she plies her needle! [Glancing at her work.] On Monday she began the Greek chief's helmet. 'Tis Thursday now, and there the needle rests At Monday's point. For some good cause, I trow, The knight was cured too soon: that chafes her. Lil. [Vexed.] Kenelm! Ken. Nay, you're not angry, Lilian? Lil. No, not angry. Ken. [To Roderick.] I'll prove it further. Yesterday I asked her, How fares Sir Oscar? Is he well? Whereto She answered, Well; yes, well; but with a sigh And look and tone so doleful, you had thought The man's last hour had come, and not his cure. [Laughing. Now say, is't not a riddle? Lil. [Displeased.] You forget Yourself, to speak so. Ken. [Penitent.] Lilian! Lil. [Giving him her hand.] There, all's well. Rod. [Aside, regarding Lilian earnestly.] So! is it thus? Come, Kenelm, find your bow, I'll see you shoot. Ken. Not now! Mark you yon cloud; there'll be a storm. Sir Oscar and Page pass by window. Rod. The knight, Sir Oscar, passes down the walk. [To Lilian] If he should enter, child, still heed my warningâ Let him not know your name or birth. Lil. Why not? He'd not betray me? Rod. No; not by intent, He might by chance. Our foes still threat the district; Wherefore the abbess from the knight has hid Your name and true estate, and lodged his train Beyond her walls. Ken. Now speaks he to the page; Now to the window looks. He will come in. Rod. Then come thou forth with me! Ken. Good faith, not I! [With a mischievous glance at Lilian.] I'd see this knight more closely. Rod. [Rather impatiently.] Dost thou heed? Thou'lt anger me! Lil. Roderick, what wait you for? Ken. To see this wondrous knight, for he's a wizard. And deals in spells. [To Roderick.] Look you, his health restored Hath wrought her sickness. But I'll stay and foil His evil charm. Lil. [Displeased.] Go, Kenelm: heed commands; I'm not in tune for this. [Kenelm hurt, and a little indignant, takes up his cap.] Nay, I spoke harshly; [Winding her arm round him. But thou know'st, Kenelm, there are times with all When no jests pleaseâwhen one would be alone. When thou dost bend thy bow, another's shadow Would spoil thine aim. When thou dost hold thy wrist For the falcon's perch, another voice would fright The bird from settling. Ken. [Archly.] Oh, I guessed not that; If that you mean to draw your bow and aim, Or lure your falcon down, I'll go; I had gone Before if I had dreamed thou'dst have me go. Lil. [Kissing his forehead.] I do not love thee less. Ken. [Taking up his foil.] Now, Roderick! [At side door. Dear Lilian! mind your aim. Allow for wind; And shoot not towards the sun. Adieu! Rod. [Playfully shaking his hand at him.] Thou mischief! [They go out by side door. Lil. [Looking after them.] Ah, light of heart! Sinks into a chair.] He comes to say farewell. What should he else? Strange how one little day Can change our world! The sun will rise for years And we wake, toil, feed, sleep, and nothing miss, Till one day dawns that with it brings a sense As of a life new-born! No hours gone by Have known that thrill; no hours to comeânor grief, Nor joy, nor changeâcan wake that thrill again! Shortly before this speech concludes Sir Oscar reappears at window, ushered by an elderly man, attired as a servant of the Convent. This attendant, by a gesture, indicates to Sir Oscar to enter the room. Attendant passes on, and disappears. Sir Oscar enters. He wears the dress of a knight of the period, with the exception of the helmet, and wears no plaid, tartan, or any Scottish badge. Sir O. [Whose face shows some slight traces of recent illness, advancing to Lilian.] Deign, dear lady, pardon For this intrusion. 'Tis a sweet, sad duty To bid you farewell. Lil. You too much presume On your new strength; pray sit. Sir O. [Sitting.] Nay, I'm once more Myself, ready for tourney or campaign; And yet, methinks, I'm half ungrateful. Lil. You? Sir O. Yes, since the health you gave me back I scarce Prize at its worth. I think of the dim chamber In which the sick man lay; of the bright presence That lit its gloom, and of the gentle hand Whose touch was balm. At first, in fever's dream, I thought some heavenly form that stooped to earth Bent o'er my pillow; and I said with joy That Heaven was kind; then soon your look and voice Proclaimed you human, and, with deeper joy, I said, She lives! she lives! she's of our world! Then all our world grew fairer. Lil. [After a short pause.] I beseech you, You speak not thus of one so little worthy; Or I may deem my cure but half complete, And say his fever talks so! Sir O. Nay, delirium Fashions no shape of perfectness like that I gaze on now. As day by day I grew In strength, and in the sense of all that's fair, The more you fill'd that sense. Whene'er you spoke Or sung, or with your harp beguiled my hours, Each act revealed your nature. Pardon, therefore, If less I prize the strength regained that parts us Than those blest days of weakness when I learned To know her whom I now must but remember. Lil. [Aside.] To hear such words, yet ne'er again to hear them! [Aloud, with suppressed feeling.] I lack skill To make due answer and to tell my thoughts; But wish you may be happy. [She extends her hand to him, which he kisses. The sky grows gradually darker. Sir O. [Retaining her hand.] So, farewell! Farewells must come. Forgive me that, being loth To say the word, I linger; for the eyes That look their last on joy may well look long. [Lilian turns aside, gently withdraws her hand, and betrays emotion. [Aside.] Did she in anger turn? not so. [Aloud.] Sweet lady, You chide not with your lips that I remain; Does your heart chide me? Would it chide me, dared I To linger still? [A pause. Lil. [Glancing at window.] You have good cause to linger; The sky grows black with storm. Sir O. And is it for thatâ For that alone you'd wish me tarry? Ah! If in an hour hence, in a day, a month, You could say farewell with no more regret Than your sweet courtesy gives to all at parting, Bid me go now; but if the thought presumptuous That, yet in bud, dares scarce unfold itself Into a hope, might live; then would I say This strength you have given back, this frame, this heartâ All that I am is yours; in every pulse, And nerve, and thought, is yours; and at your feet Would cast the life which you preserved in vain, Save your love crown it too! [Throws himself at her feet. Lil. I pray you, rise. Sir O. Have I too far presumed? Dost bid me go? Lil. I bade thee rise; I did not bid thee go. Sir O. And dost not now? Lil. Not if you wish to stay. Sir O. Do I but dream of joy? Is it thy will I stay? Speak! Nay, I ask not words; but reach Thy hand for sign. [She gives him her hand.] Thou dost! Oh! half I doubt That Heaven to this harsh world can be so kind And remake paradise. [Rising.] Quick to my heart, And seal this true! [They embrace.] Thou'rt mine! Lil. Ay, thineâthine ever! [Pauses. Sir O. And we but late were strangers! Lil. [Sits.] Ah! to me Thou wast no stranger. I had seen thee oft Ere my eyes met thee. Sir O. Seen me! Lil. Know'st thou not How oft our minds, when earth seems fairest, shape Some being fit to tread it? Thus at sunset, When in the lake's pure floor the circling peaks Beheld their jewelled image, and entranced, I asked if heaven above or heaven below Did ravish more with beauty; or in autumn, When through the woods, sighing with tremulous leaves Of gold or crimson, like a conscious life The brook pulsed on, then would I cry, O earth! How fair thou art! Give me a man to match thee! In mien let him be noble, brave of heart, To rule so bright a realm; in war, his voice Dread as the sea's; in peace, as soft as winds That roam in summer 'mid the pines, and teach The dim green twilight tunes. Be such my lord! And when I met and knew thee first, I felt That what my heart imagined Heaven had clothed In mortal form, and that I saw my prayer! Sir O. Thy love shames my deserving; yet 'tis true We loved as in a dreamâno thought of self, No thought of state or fortune. To this hour I know thee but as lady and as Lilian; And thou too know'st me but as knight and Oscar. Lil. Yet since the very raiment that love wears Pleases the eye, tell me in what apparel Has Fortune dressed thee? What's thy name? thy birth? Thy serving-men are French, and yet thou speak'st Our tongue. Sir O. [Sitting.] My native tongue; I never lost it. My father, dwelling some brief while in France, Did choose his bride there, and with her returned Unto the Scottish glen, where I was born. I, still a child, my mother's health grew frail, And, pining much to see her land again, With me, her youngest born, did she repair To France, and there amid her kinsmen died. Those kinsmen loved her child, and oneâa noble Of the French Courtâprevailing with my father, Made me his page. At length, high tales of war And soldier's fame, recounted by the hearth, Woke martial longings in me, and I joined The French king's service; in the which till now My life has passed. Years since I, sorrowing, learned My father's death. Now, during war's brief lull, To Scotland am I come to seek my brother And mine own people. [Thunder and lightning faintly heard and seen. Lil. Well, thy race? thy name? Sir O. Knowing what feuds my clansmen wage, and loth To peril my few followers, I concealed A name that oft wakes strife. Thou know'st the restâ That a marauding band, in hope of plunder, Assailed us; that with spur and sword we forced Our passage and rode on, till, near this spot, Faint with my wounds, I reeled, and here was borne, Blest in what seemed disaster. Lil. Yet not finding More blessing than you brought. Sir O. [Taking her hand.] Thou mak'st my joy Too full. For this one hour I'll pardon fate All frowns hereafter. Lov'st thou, what can rob Oscar Mackane of thee? Lil. [Agitated.] Mackane! Of whom Speak'st thou? Oscar Mackane! Sir O. My name, which thou May'st proudly bear. The son of Fergus I., Brother of Murdoch, chief of the Mackanes. Lil. [Withdrawing her hand, and recoiling.] Thou Murdoch's brother! Sir O. He still lives? Lil. He lives. [Thunder and lightning somewhat more vivid and audible than before. Would that he ne'er had lived, or thou not sprung From the same stock! Sir O. Wherefore? Lil. In me thou see'st The child of Angus, late Macronald's chief. [Both rise. Sir O. [Recoiling.] Macronald! our hereditary foe! Lil. In fight with the fierce tribe thy brother led My father fell. Sir O. [With horror.] Not by my brother's hand? Lil. Not by his hand, But by his followers; and, beside the hate Instinctive towards thy name, that with the stream Of life we draw even from our mother's breasts, Know that, where'er I turn, our gaping ranks Show the fell shafts of thine. My uncles perished Stemming their onset; my young kinsman David They snared and slew; that I stand here an orphan Is due to them, thy kin. Away! a gulf Between us yawns, and every wave is blood! Sir O. Not more thou shrink'st than I. Upon thy breast That tartan, [Pointing to her plaid] unbeheld since childhood, grows Familiar to meâthe abhorreÃ¨d emblem Of a loathed race! [A short pause, during which he gazes at her, as if bewildered.] Loathed, did I say; and thou Sprung from that race! [Thunder and lightning still more vivid and audible.] By heaven, two natures strive Within my breast! One for my kinsmen's wrongs Prompts me to hate, the other pleads, Forget All wrongs for her! Lil. Obey the sterner voice; For I could deem my father's spirit rose Frowning that still I listen. [Softening.] Oscar, go! I may not love thee, and I cannot hate. Sir O. Thou canst not hate! Nor I. If enemy's blood Flow in thy veins, it flows not in thy soul, Which has its kin in heaven. Lil. [Sadly, with a gesture of rejection.] Hence! Sir O. Look on me, As I on thee; I love the thing thou art, And ask not whence it sprang. [Thunder loud, and lightning vivid. Lil. Oh, thou dost strain My being to its root. I might for thee Brave living kindred's wrath; but the mute frown Of the dead who cannot plead, who sleep in trust, Their child will ne'er be traitor to their bloodâ This, this appals me. [A loud and long crash of thunder and vivid lightning.] Hark! 'tis heaven's own voice Uttering its prohibition! If thou seest The fierceness of her struggle whom love tempts And duty warns; if thou wouldst have me 'scape My people's curse; by thine own love for me, Help me; save, save me from myself, and go! Sir O. Harsh doom! but I obey thee even in this. [Sir Oscar bends his head low in acquiescence, then slowly retires, and goes out by door opposite to that by which Roderick and Kenelm went out. Lil. 'Tis well. I have been true to name and clan. I have slain my happy youth, and made its grave An altar to my race. To-morrow's sun Will fall where we two stood; on us together Will fall no more. And he, alas! will not My doom be his? Duty! Had I no duty To him who taught me first what life might be, With love's strong arm broke for my sake the chain Of deadliest hate? No more to hear the voice That woke my heart to life, to bear within This ceaseless yearning widowhood of soul For him who lives, but lives no more for me! [The sound of a horn is heard. That horn! his train set forth! [The Squire and Page and other followers of Sir Oscar pass at back.] They pass! Even now The gates are opening! [Sir Oscar is slowly passing.] Oscar, Oscar, stay! [He approaches some steps towards her. By all I bear, I know what thou must bear. I might have doomed myself to appease my race, Not thee, not thee! Oscar, canst thou forgive, Canst thou accept this heart, which, for thy sake, Bursts all the chains of hate, tradition, clan? Sir O. [Advancing, and extending his arms towards her.] Thou art my clan, my fate, my all in all! [She throws herself into his arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. [SCENE I.] Scene.âNoonday. A valley in the Highlands. A wood of oaks at back. Mountains in the distance. On one side an arched gateway, leading to an old tower. Rude rustic benches, with the massive felled trunk of an oak, are scattered about. An old rough stone of some size, which serves for goal in the race, is seen on side of stage opposite to gateway. As the curtain rises, it discovers the clansmen of the Clan Mackane, with other men and women of various ages, including children of both sexes from the neighbouring glen and village. Michael and Colin, as near connections of the chief, wear each an eagle's feather in his bonnet. Other Clansmen wear each in his bonnet a sprig of holly, as the badge of the Mackane. As the curtain rises, shouts from some of âAllan! Allan!â From others of âDougal! Dougal! Dougal!â All are looking off scene towards side at back. 1st Chorus. Allan! 2d Chorus. Dougal! 1st Chorus. Allan! Allan enters, running rapidly towards the stone, the goal, amidst the applause of the greater part of spectators, who exclaim, âWell sped, Allan! Allan!â Dougal enters almost instantly after Allan, and runs after him to the goal. Col. [Clapping Dougal on the back.] Take heart, good Dougal! He need nothing boast; You'll beat him yet. You're the chief's thirteenth cousin, And, by my reckoning, he is but the twentieth. Eff. [Soothingly.] Indeed you ran him hard. Doug. [Panting.] A minute more I'd past himâsee, he pants, while IâI'm fresh And sound of windâscarce breathed! [They laugh. Eff. Ay, ay, we know, But that some sorry chance still plays you false, You'd always be his master. Doug. Am his master. Jest on. You're jealous that I danced with Rose. Rose. My next dance is with Allan. Doug. [To Effie.] Let him take My cast-off gear and wear it. Allan. Your cast gear! Braggart! Doug. Braggart! [They lay their hands on their sword-hilts. Mic. No strife! What! strife to-day, When, till our scouts report the foe, we hold High festival to welcome the return Of Oscar, and our chief's brother, long deemed dead Rose. [To Allan.] Hear you? Eff. [To Dougal.] Take hands! [Dougal and Allan somewhat sulkily shake hands. Mic. Be the time henceforth spent In Oscar's honour. [All but Michael and Colin disperse themselves over the ground. Some converse in groups standing, sitting, or reclining on the grass. Others examine the hammers which have been brought back. Others take up bows and arrows and prepare to shoot. Clansmen who went out return and join the rest. Mic. [To Colin, who has remained with him in front.] But 'tis strange he comes not, To share these sports with which our people greet him. Col. Oscar? He's still with Murdoch. Mic. 'Tis not wise In Murdoch to delay him. Col. You forget; Murdoch's your chief. Mic. No more the chief he was. Since that dark hour when by Macronald's band His son, young Kenelm, was borne off and slain, But one thought holds him, and his fitful will Scarce brooks restraint of reason. Even here, Where we have marched from home, that in this glen, Our thinned force may the better cope with Cameronâ Here on Macronald's borders has he spurned His offered peace, and challenged double strife, Though weak to meet it single. Col. He's your chief. Mic. And leads us to our ruin. Col. He's my chief; I'll follow him to ruin. Mic. Follow madness? Col. If madness be his humour, 'tis his choice, Not mine. He's still my chief. Mic. Silence! he comesâ He and his brother Oscar. Enter Murdoch and Oscar from archway. Followed by Sir Oscar's squire and page, they advance to front, Sir Oscar still wearing his dress of 2d Act, and no Scottish plaid, tartan, or badge. The various groups come to front to meet them. The squire and page mix with the Clansmen and others, and converse. Murdoch stands a minute silent and absorbed, then sits abstracted on felled trunk of tree. Sir O. [To Clansmen and others.] Kinsmen, friends, Pardon if I, a seeming laggard, come To thank your welcome of me, who went forth A child, and am returned to you a man. Beseech you make not my delay offence, For I was held in counsel with my brother On what concerns us all. Mic. [Taking Sir Oscar's hand.] Thrice welcome, Oscar, The brother of our chief! Chorus of Clanspeople. Ay, long live Oscar! Col. A welcome for the chief too; long live Murdoch! [Waving his bonnet. Some Clanspeople. [With a fainter cry, in which the rest do not join.] Ay, long live Murdoch! Sir O. [Aside.] Cold greeting for their chief! [To Murdoch, who still sits abstracted.] They greet you, brother. I say your people greet you. Mur. [Half-rousing himself.] Greet me? Thank them. Say that I thank them. [Relapses into gloomy reverie. Sir O. [To Clanspeople.] To the full, we both Exchange our love with youâyour chief and I. But let your sports proceed. Here on the strath Let each man draw his bow, and he whose shaft In three encounters strikes the nearest home, Shall for his trophy wear a jewelled sword, Which from my foe in deadly fight I plucked, Warring for France! Col. A costly prize! [To Clansmen.] Put forth Your best skill to deserve it. All. Ay! ay! Sir O. [To Murdoch.] Brother, you Will witness this contention? Mur. [Looking up.] I? not now. I have no humour for't. Sir O. [To Clanspeople.] Affairs of weight Engage my brother still. Some later hourâ Say two hours past the noonâshall you contest, And he award, the prize. Mic. [To other Clanspeople.] Even now our meal Lies spread on yonder slope. Follow! To Oscar, So late restored, we'll drain our cups. Clanspeople. Ay, full ones! Mic. You from the glen and village will partake Our feast. Sweet, by your leave. [To Effie, who proudly takes his arm. Doug. [Surlily.] By my leave, Michael. Mic. By yours when she is yours. Doug. [Turning to Rose.] Come, Rose! Rose. [Who slides her arm into Allan's.] Too late! I promised him the next dance. [Going up with Allan. Doug. [Angrily.] So! Mic. [Looking back on them as he is about to go out.] Remember, No strife, 'tis Oscar's day; a health to Oscar! Eff. Ay, ay, we'll all drink that. Various Clanspeople. A cup to Oscar! [All Clanspeople and others, Murdoch, Oscar, and Colin excepted, rush out gaily, the men with their partners; the squire and page amongst the rest. Sir O. [To Murdoch, who still sits in gloomy abstraction Colin reclining near him on the grass.] Murdoch, their feast lacks its best grace, if you, Our chieftain, hold aloof. With me, and join them! Mur. [Looking up.] Join them in what? their mirth? Sir O. Their chief should make Their mirth his own. Mur. 'Tis well; you lesson me, My new-found brother. Sir O. And your younger brother By some ten years, I grant; I'd not offend. [Going. Mur. [Softening.] Nay, Oscar, go not. If the wide earth hold Aught dear to meâthe which I doubtâ'tis thou. [Looking earnestly at Oscar, then speaking to Colin, and laying his hand on Colin's arm. Mark you not in his look a somethingâsomething That hints the face we miss? Col. Our Kenelm's face? Mur. [In a low, fierce tone.] Peace! Did I bid thee name him? Speak not! [He again falls into deep and gloomy abstraction. Sir O. [Seating himself on a bench by Colin, and speaking to him apart.] Pray you, What cause has moved him thus? Col. [Apart to Sir Oscar.] Sir, 'tis a wound That I did ill in probing. See! again He's lost! [Pointing to Murdoch.] His mood is on him. When it falls, He shuns all converse, breaks not fast, nor gives His nights to sleep, but sits in moveless gloom. And yet, I have at times the luck or skill To rouse him and dispel his evil hour. I will essay it. Mark! I speak to you. [Then addressing Sir Oscar in louder tone, that Murdoch may hear. If you demand of me what deeds in fight Your brother wrought, my task is hard to choose What I shall note, or where begin. The growth Upon his chin was down, not hair, when first He drew claymore. When was itâwhenâsay, chief, [Turning to Murdoch] When first blood dyed your steel? Sir O. [Who, with Colin, turns and observes Murdoch.] He heeds you not. Col. [Musing.] When, when? [Again addressing Murdoch.] Was't not that far-off night (What years have flown since thenâ'twas early springâ) When our brave lads drove off the foeman's herds, And we, belated, followed far behind? See'st thou that night? Sir O. [Who, with Colin, still watches Murdoch.] He's rapt; you squander breath. Col. [Still to Murdoch.] That night of misty moonlight, when, like dogs That track the boar, they with deep-chested yell Strained on our path? [Apart to Sir Oscar.] Now mark! Sir O. [Observing that Murdoch still sits motionless.] You rouse him not. Col. [Still addressing Murdoch.] Who were they that pursued With yells and opening jaws? The accursed Macronalds! Mur. [Suddenly kindling into interest, and grasping Colin's arm.] Ay, the Macronalds! Colin, thou say'st well. Go on; what did I then? what then? Col. Thou knowest. Some five, whose speed outstripped the rest, o'ertook And hemmed us round. Then stood we twain at bay. Mur. [Excitedly.] At bay, and, like the boar you spoke of, rent them With tusks of steel. A living wall they stood; We smote, and like a shattered wall they fell! Thy axe made breaches there! Col. The more part sank Beneath your arm. Mur. [Pleased.] Thou say'st so! Sir O. At great odds Did you contend! Col. [Exultingly to Sir Oscar.] And he, young hawk, first struck His quarry there! You had been proud to wear His tartan later on Glen Allan's field. Thrice at the Glen's mouth, with a shout that mocked The ocean's roar, the fierce Macronald beat, While with a scanty force your brother thrice, Rock-like, repelled themâ Mur. [Interrupting with glee.] Till 'twas turn of tide, And the roar sank, and all that sullen sea, Moaning, ebbed out, nor left a trace behind But the white surf of dead! Among their deadâ Ay, ay; say on; say on! [To Colin. Col. Among their dead, Three of Macronald's raceâtheir bonnets bore The eagle's plumeâlay stretched. Mur. [Springing up exultingly.] I had dealt on them! I, only I! Col. Thou only, chief. Mur. [Laughing.] Ha, ha! Thy words are wine, brave heart! As I had known Their ruthless tribe should one day from his lair Hunt my poor whelp to death, I took revenge Beforehand; but my heart, unslaked, could drink Revenge as sand drinks water. I am parched [Raising his hands to heaven]. More rain! more rain! Col. [Joyfully to Oscar.] He's roused at last. Sir O. [Aside.] By hatred To Lilian's race! [To Murdoch.] That you have borne dire wrongs I may not doubt. Still prudence, not revenge, Should sway a leader. If I hear aright, The Camerons, counting on your wasted strengths, Are now no less Macronald's foes than yours. Against this new foe should you turn your swords Forgetting former feud. Mur. Forget our debt To the Macronald? I'd as soon forget My mother's last kiss, or my dead wife's first, Or my slain boy's parting clasp. To him and his We owe our shorn strength, ravaged land, crushed prideâ Fuel enough for hate. But if in you It smoulders, I'll throw oil on. [Motions Sir Oscar to trunk of felled tree, while Colin makes a deprecating gesture. Murdoch and Sir Oscar sit. A short pause.] You came back This morn as from the dead, and yet I smiled not. You have seen my face light upâas the scarred cliff Beneath the storm-flashâwhile a laugh more bitter Than groans broke from me; but you have not seenâ You will not see me smile. Sir O. My brother! Mur. Yet I once could smile, and, strange! for joy could weep, I had a boy, in whose soft brow, clear eyes, And trick of speech his mother lived again. And often when he spoke a sudden echo Surprised me from the ruins of my youth; And when he trod the health my fancy leaped The years to come, and saw the eagle's plume Stream from his bonnet, as, with drawn claymore, And our wild war-cry on his lips, he led Our van to battle, as a comet leads The trail of light behind it! Col. Ay; he ne'er Had shamed his stock, chief! Mur. [Continuing to Oscar.] Well, this boy, my Kenelm, Who was to meâguess what an only son, His mother in the grave, is to a father!â Going forth to fight, I left him in the care Of humble folk, whose lowly roof I deemed Would be a safe and less suspected shelter Than my own walls; but there the hunters tracked him, Seized, bore him off, and doubtless dyed their hands In a child's blood. My Kenelm! [Pauses in paroxysm of grief.] Ask you still Why for one hope I live, and only one, Revenge upon his murderers? Sir O. [Giving his hand to Murdoch.] My heart, brother, Bleeds at this deed abhorred. Not less than you Would I pursue the doer. Mur. [Half suspiciously.] Sir, I thank you; I had so much believed. Sir O. But could Macronald, Or kin of his, be privy to such horror? No, 'twas some caitiff follower! Mur. [Withdrawing his hand, and speaking bitterly.] You can weigh this! You're nice in right! What hunted creature asks Of the pursuing throng whose spear transfixed it? It turns and rends the foremost. Save you, sir, I was a father, and your temperate virtue Offends my too rash blood. Farewell, just brother! [Going, he turns to Colin, who is following him, and waves him back. Not now, I'd be alone. [Murdoch goes out by gateway into tower. Sir O. [Aside.] When he shall learn That to Macronald's child I stand betrothed, What bounds will curb his fury? Col. Look you, sir, The chief went hence in anger; you do ill To cross his mood. Sir O. How if his mood go wrong? Col. Your part is still submission. If I bid My dog to leap a chasm, though the plunge Be death, he takes it. What your chief has willed Is your will; or it should be. Sir O. And it might be, Were I his dog. Enter Michael hastily. Mic. Kinsmen, I bear grave news. Those we sent forth have learned by sure report That Cameron, whose advance we deemed was near, Falls back towards England. Sir O. England! Mic. Whence by bribes And pledge of Scottish spoil he gains allies. Thus reinforced, he bends his swollen strength At once against Macronald's clan and ours. Col. Then but one choice is left, to sell life dearly. Sir O. Were it not wisdom if, with your old foes, You now made league 'gainst new ones? Col. League! no league With the Macronalds! Mic. Others say not so. [To Oscar.] Know you not then that three days since their chief, Young Malcolm, proffered peace and his alliance Unto your brother? Sir O. [Joyfully.] Was this so? Mic. Albeit, Old rancours in our breasts at first prevailed, To both clans had this union been safety, To ours existence. That we were most rash To spurn it, hour by hour grows clear to all. Sir O. Then it was spurned? Mic. Almost before 'twas utter'd. Col. By Murdoch, who with scorn drove back the envoy. Sir O. All this admits of cure. Murdoch, a Scotsman, No less than chief and clansman, when he hears That Cameron fees English swords against us, Will join with Malcolm! Col. [Aside.] Will he so? 'Tis fit He learn your scheme betimes. [He goes out by gateway towards tower. Sir O. I'll seek my brother. How takes Macronald this? Mic. Even as befits A name we hate but honour. He prepares To leave his castle, and pursuing Cameron, Engage him ere by English succour joined. Sir O. Would Murdoch did the like. [Going. Mic. 'Twere well. [A shout without of âA dance! A dance!â Some of the Clanspeople are here seen entering at back, and motioning to the rest. But see our people, Now from the feast press in for song and dance. Stay for their sport; so shall you win their love! Sir O. Sir, I am theirs. 'Tis thus they show me welcome. [Other Clanspeople re-enter, accompanied by men, women, and children from the neighbourhood, also Sir Oscar's knight and page. The two latter take seats to witness the dance. Foremost Clansmen, with cries of âClear, clear the ground!â remove off the stage the trunk of felled tree, benches, &amp;c. Others shout, âA song, a song!â Sir O. [To Michael.] Their mirth well pleases me. These hearts so light In danger's front are just the hearts to face it. Eff. [Who has overheard Sir Oscar.] Sir knight, your speech smacks of the song we dance to. Sir O. Fair maid, let's hear that song. [All approach their partners except Sir Oscar and Michael, who sit at side in front, and Sir Oscar's knight and page, who sit at back. Pipers, dressed as clansmen like the rest, enter with bagpipes, also a harper with harp, and other musicians. Dougal advances to Effie, who, after coquettish hesitating glances at Allan, takes Dougal. Allan advances to Rose, who, after similar glances at Dougal, takes Allan. Song sung to music, in which the notes of the bagpipes are distinctly heard. Song. Let every laddie take his lass, And dance while yet he may; For a clansman's life doth quickly pass From song and feast to fray. His arm round her waist and her lip to taste, What time for care and sorrow? The hours are fleet and her smile is sweet: Dance to-day and fight to-morrow! [A Highland dance, the dancers repeating the last four lines as chorus, reaching their plaids one to another, and swaying them gently in their hands from side to side. The dance, as it progresses, should in this and subsequent chorus, be also accompanied by excited cries and gestures on the part of those engaged. 2d Verse. Let every lassie take her lad, And love him while she can; Be this day bright, though the next be sad When goes her own braw man; His arm round her waist and her lip to taste, What time for care or sorrow? The hours are fleet and her kiss is sweet: Dance to-day and fight to-morrow! [Before the dance is resumed, Sir Oscar advances to Effie; Michael advances to Rose; Effie withdraws her hand from Dougal, and gives it to Sir Oscar; Rose withdraws her hand from Allan, and gives it to Michael. For a moment Dougal and Allan turn away sulkily; then each seizes the disengaged hand of his former partner. Sir Oscar's squire and page now each take the disengaged hand of a female dancer. The dance is resumed, the dancers again repeating the last four lines as chorus, and using their plaids as before. When the dance has reached a certain point, scene closes. SCENE II. A rude hall in the tower. Early afternoon. Enter from inner door Murdoch and Colin. Mur. How say'st thou? He would have me league with Malcolm! In friendship clasp the hand our blood has stained, Forego the sole sweet joy that life has left. A retribution matchless as my wrongs! Col. Such is your brother's purpose. [Looking off.] But he comes, Doubtless to speak it. Enter Sir Oscar from without, through open door. Mur. [To Sir Oscar.] Tell me what's thy name? You brought me seeming proof you were my brother. 'Twas false; if through your veins my blood did course, You could not be at heart so alien. Has Colin slandered you, or dare you tell meâ Me, chief of the Mackanesâyou counsel friendship With Malcolm of Macronald? Sir O. Strife in brothersâ If they must striveâbrooks no observer's eye; I'll answer you alone. Mur. Go, Colin. [Colin goes out. Sir O. Yes, 'tis true; I counsel union. Mur. [With a tone of significant menace.] Bold, even in a brother! Sir O. You grant your followers, worn by feuds, too weak Singly to cope with Cameron; yet your force, With Malcolm's joined, might brave him. You'll not doubt What course befits you when you hear that Cameron Leads English mercenaries 'gainst you both, And, with the spoil from bleeding Scotland wrung, Pays hireling stabbers! Murdoch, you'll protect Scotlandâour mother! Mur. Kenelm was my son. Much I love Scotland, more I hate Macronald. Sir O. You stand here chief and leader. With your honours Accept your duties. When the time admits Of private vengeance, then be only Murdoch; But now, when clan and country call on you, Be Scotsman, chief, and gentleman. Mur. And cry To Malcolm, I repent, I sue for aid! Sir O. You give as well as sue, if, following him, You march towards England on the foe. Mur. [Eagerly.] Has Malcolm Set forth towards England? Sir O. So our tidings run. Mur. [Musingly to himself, but heard by Sir Oscar.] Then his main force goes with him, and his castle Defenceless lies. We're near it, on his borders! Sir O. What mean you? Mur. [Still to himself, but still heard by Sir Oscar.] Yet he has nor wife nor child; No crevice in his armour where the shaft Envenomed might pierce home; he mocks my vengeance. Had Angus lived, he was a father; he Had felt the pangs I bear. [As struck with a sudden thought.] If a child's cry Could reach him, 'mid the fiends', and startle hell With a new torment! He has left a daughter. Last night, 'tis said, she to Macronald's home Returnedânow dwells there! [Exultingly.] Ay, we're on his borders! Sir O. [Fiercely.] Hold, Murdoch; What dost thou plan? Mur. [With a sinister laugh.] You rouse me from a dream. Methought I played a game, and rose no winner; But still with equal fortune, child for child! Sir O. Speak! what's your thought? Heaven grant my fears have wronged you. Plott'st thou against the freedom or the life Of Lilian of Macronald? Mur. Ha! you're quick To solve a riddle, brother. [Laying his hand on Sir Oscar's shoulder. Sir O. Take thy hand From my stained person, and unteach thy lips That name of brother. If thou practise ill On her, or by connivance suffer it, Then look not to Macronald's line or Cameron's For thy worst enemy, but find him here, In me who own thy name and share thy blood, But scarce forgive my mother that thou sprang'st From the same womb that bore me! Mur. Does my sense Serve or delude me? Do I hear or see? Thou beard'st me! [Restraining himself.] Go! the fire is in the cloud, But bursts not yet. To shelter, boy; to shelter! [With a sudden change of tone.] What is the daughter of my rival's house To theeâa stranger? Sir O. Stranger is she none, To her I, sick and wounded, owed my life; To her the love that crowns life. Know in her My late preserver, and my wife betrothed! Mur. Betrothed! Thou! she! [Aside.] I much suspect my thoughts Of wandering. [After a pause, to him.] Say it, if thou canst, again; Thou wedd'st with a Macronald? Sir O. Not more sure That yon sun shines than, if we live, we wed. Mur. Thy words smite on my brain, as on a door Foemen with sword-hilts knock in time of war, While those within, half-drowned in sleep, rise staggering, And let in murder! To my wakening sense So dost thou stand. False, not to me alone, But to thy sires and clan; false to the dead And to the living; false to tomb and altar; To nature's instinct false, as if life's stream Within the veins should roll back on the heart That was its source, and choke it! False asânay, Thou'rt not this thing; say I but charge on thee My fancy's monstrous growth; say thou'rt my brother, And crush not him who called thy father, father! [Throws himself in supplication at Sir Oscar's feet. Sir O. [Compassionately.] I pity thee. Mur. Ay, thou wert ruthless else; But dost thou yield? Thou dost! Sir O. I cannot yield When only fury pleads. [Turning from him. While Sir Oscar speaks these last words, enter Michael, Colin, and several other Clansmen. Mic. [On entering.] Murdoch, these tidings Should lead to prompt resolve. Mur. [Starting up, to Sir Oscar.] Then meet that fury! [Drawing his sword. Words have no power to blast, be this my tongue. [Rushes with sword on Sir Oscar, who seizes his arm, wrests sword from him, and throws it aside. Colin takes it up. Mic. His sword drawn on a brother! [All but Colin look menacingly at Murdoch. Sir O. [To Michael.] In brief madness, Which cooler thought rebukes. Col. [Reaching Murdoch his sword, and speaking significantly apart to him.] Though all else frown, I'm still thy hand to do the thing thou bidd'st. Mur. [Feebly.] You say well, Oscar. [Pressing his hand to his forehead.] All here's storm and darkness. [Significantly.] If ever light break in, I'll better pay The dues I owe you, brother! [To Colin.] Lead me forth, I'm feeble, and want rest. [He goes out, leaning on Colin, who, as he goes out, turns and regards the rest with a look of fierce reproach. Mic. Oscar, our hope Is fixed on you. He whom his frenzy rules No more rules us. Other Clansmen. No more, no more! Mic. To counsel then, for all Await your voice. Sir O. In what befits a brother You shall command me. He is still my brother. [All go out by open door, opposite to that by which Murdoch and Colin went out. SCENE III. Sun fast declining; about an hour from sunset. An upper apartment of Malcolm's Castle. A door at side. Two large painted windows at back. Between them a narrow door (open), which commands a Gothic terrace, and gives a glimpse of a lake beyond. Another door at side. Three or four portraits of former Macronald chiefs, in their Highland and clan costume, on the walls; amongst these, conspicuous to audience, is a portrait of Lilian's father, Angus. Another portrait opposite side-door conceals a sliding panel. An oratory, with altar and plain crucifix, surmounted by a small lamp, not lighted in this scene, is also conspicuous to audience. Old armour, swords, shields, battle-axes, &amp;c., grouped on walls. Enter Lilian, still dressed in slight mourning, and Roderick. Lil. What say'st thou, Roderick? The clan Mackane Are on our frontier! Rod. Ay; from where they muster They see our battlements. We from the convent Returning, barely missed them. By heaven's grace You're now 'neath Malcolm's roof; at home once more. Lil. [Involuntarily referring to Sir Oscar, and overheard by Roderick.] Then is he near? Rod. Who? Malcolm! Well, you know He with his followers pursues the Camerons. He has left you thinly guarded; but fear not. Lil. What sound was that? [The panel slides open. Kenelm enters. Closes the panel, and advances. Lilian. Sportively.] Ah, mischief! art thou here? Why by that panel enter like a thief, When all else use the door? Ken. Because I choose To do what others do not, and I love Things curious and forbidden. Rod. Then Dame Nature Errend in thy sex; thou shouldst have been a woman. Ken. [Affecting despondency.] Alas, I'm not a woman! Yesterday, Descending by the secret stair whereto That panel leads, I strove to thread the maze Of winding vaults below; I'd torch in hand, But lost my way. Now had I been a woman, I'd found my way, for women are like cats: They see best in the night, and are at home In all that's dark and crooked. [Laughing.] 'Tis so, Lilian! [To Roderick.] 'Twas she that taught me first the panel's trick. To-day I'd better luck; kept straight my path Through the oozing walls of stone, till mounting steps Upbore me to a grate, which, pushed, gave way, And I was in the sunlightânone to watchâ [With a sudden change to bitter sadness. As free as when I trod my father's hills! Lilian, I tell you, I will see my father; Not all my love for you can stop the hunger For home that gnaws me. Lil. [Placing her arm round him, compassionately.] My poor Kenelm! Rod. [To Kenelm, emphatically and sternly.] Boy! Must you again be warned? Remember well The vain attempt at flight might prove your death. [Softening.] Poor petted fawn! keep in thy lady's bower, And thou art safe. Lil. [To Kenelm.] Chide not! 'tis nature's self Prompts his desire. Kenelm, though you must bear This durance, still you know that Lilian's heart Would beat even with your joy if you were free. And yet she'd miss thee much. Ken. [Taking both her hands.] I do believe You would have all free as you areâhold none captiveâ [Archly.] Except some wounded knight too early cured. Well, wounded birds, uncaged, will oft fly back, And so may he. [Lilian turns from him rather sadly. Rod. [Admonishingly to Kenelm.] Peace! peace! [A horn is heard without, followed by the tramp of a horse.] A horn! And now The tramp of horse! Perchance 'tis news of Malcolm. Lil. Perchance a foeman's summons. The Mackanes, You say, are near? [Kenelm, who is listening, slightly starts, then conceals his emotion. Rod. But humbled, and too weak To brave your cousin's wrath. Ken. [Aside.] How! The Mackanes Are nearâmy father near! [Aloud, after a short pause.] 'Tis now the hour When Randolph comes back with his hawks. I'll meet him, And ask him of his sport. Rod. And to the hall Will I, and find what stirs. 'Tis nought, dear lady, To cause you fear: I will report full soon. [To Kenelm.] Come, lad! Ken. A moment. [To Lilian, with earnest tenderness.] Lilian, if now Or ever I have angered youâand oft I've given you cause for angerâyou'll forgive me? The madcap always loved you. Lil. [Touched.] Ne'er did Lilian Doubt that, dear boy. [Kissing him.] Heaven's blessing rest on thee! Rod. [Jestingly.] Enough, enough! This sugar spoils the teeth. Come, come, pet fawn! Ken. Say rather prisoned fawn. Rod. There's much to give and take, boy; the pet fawn Is tethered and shut up; but the wild fawnâ Ken. [Interrupting.] Is freeâis happy! Rod. Humph! he's shot and roasted. [Roderick and Kenelm go out by side door. Lil. [Sitting.] Dear, hapless boy! His name was on my lips When Oscar left me. I had almost said, Your nephew lives! Well that I checked my tongue! That knowledge then had led to new assaults From Murdoch, which resisted, in the strife The lad perchance had fallen! For his safety I must be secret still; but when a bride I fly to Oscar, he shall share my flight. 'Twill crown anew the royal hour we wed, To say, Thy brother's son by me preserved! Ah me! when comes that hour? Is all a dream? Did he indeed lie wounded at St Catherine's? Did I there tend him! And oh! did we part But three days since? He promised on the third To send a trusted friar, by whose report I should our time and place of meeting learn. The sun declines, and yet he has not sent. Sir O. [To Roderick without.] She is within, alone? Re-enter Roderick, followed by Sir Oscar, who still wears no plaid or other tartan, or any badge of the Mackanes. Rod. So please you, lady, The stranger knight. [Goes out. Lil. Thou, Oscar! Sir O. My heart's heart! [They embrace. Lil. Thou'rt here indeed; but in this house, in peril! Sir O. No peril, love. None here surmise my birth. I'm but a stranger and a knight from France, By you befriended. No, sweet Lilian, 'Tis you who are in peril. In this fortress, Feebly defended, you but court attack, While enemies, if few, yet subtle, plot Against your freedomâlife. Hear me, who know Your danger, and in you would save myself. Ere dawns to-morrow's sun, give me such right As none else have to guard you. Be my wife! Lil. Thy wife to-night! Sir O. To-night.âI, with my train, Will come and bear thee forth. A league from hence A wayside chapel stands. There shall the priest Await us; and, the rite performed, I'll lead thee To the safe shelter of his sister's roof, Where thou shalt bide till I returning claim thee. Lil. This night! Doubt not my love, but in that step A girl takes passing from old life to newâ There's awe as well as joy! Grant time. Sir O. Thy danger Of time admits not. Further know, my brother, For gravest reasons, stands awhile deposed From his command, and by the more part I Am named his deputy. At break of day I lead our clansmen to the aid of yours, Who singly strive with Cameron. Lil. [In wonder.] Your Mackanesâ They league with usâwith Malcolm! Sir O. You shall learn Hereafter how this fell; now hold it true. Lil. May this blest union ever bind you friends. Sir O. Heaven grant it, sweet; but to my suit. Once more I say thou art in peril. Ere I don A soldier's harness, let me bear thee hence To a sure refuge. If thou still dost fear These hurried nuptials, I obey thy will And leave thee there unwed. But ifâ Lil. Stay, Oscar: Thou goest to battle. He who gives the victory Alone foreknows the end. I shrink no more. Be it so. Ere thou goest, join our fatesâ Claim me for thine! [Extending both her hands, which he takes.] Then, com'st thou back a victor, This swelling heart shall hail thee all my own; And ifâ Sir O. If fate be darkest? Lil. Ay, even then I should be blest, for I should join thee soon. Till then, oh! dearer far thy memory Than any hope surviving. I should know That for some blessÃ¨d hours I called thee mine. And, cleaving to that thought, look grief in the face And say, I once was his! Take, take me, Oscar! [She falls on his neck. Sir O. Perfect in trust as goodness! At thy word I take thee. See, the sun goes down apace; Ere it has set two hours, I will return. [They turn towards door, which is open. Murdoch, disguised in the travelling garb of a minstrel, looks in at door. He wears a cloak with a hood, which partially conceals his face and quite disguises his identity. Lil. [Starting.] Ah, look! who's he that on us bends a gaze So strange and fixed? Sir O. Some pilgrim, by his garb. [Smiling.] Why dost thou start? [Advancing to door, and speaking to Murdoch, who is retiring. Who art thou? What's thine errand? Mur. [Who assumes the gait, manner, and voice of an aged man, returns.] A travelling minstrel I, who, on my way, Have tidings for this house. Sir O. [To Lilian.] Shall he approach? His news may be of import. Lil. Ay, but go not. Sir O. [At door to Murdoch.] Enter. [To Evan without.] You, fellow, bear his harp. Enter Murdoch followed by Evan, bearing harp. Evan, who is one of Macronald's domestics, wears the Macronald plaid. Mur. [To Lilian.] Fair lady, See I in you the daughter of the chief? Lil. Of him who was the chiefâmy father's dead. Mur. [Aside.] 'Tis she. [Aloud.] These woful words must I repay With sounds as harsh. As minstrel late I served The young Monteith. Your father loved him well. A rival of my lord in maiden's love Slew him in strife o'er wine. These news I bear To Monteith's distant kinsman, and was bid, When journeying to him, to acquaint Macronald With our dire grief. Lil. My father was the friend Of the brave house you serve. I, as his child, Lament its loss. Mur. Lady, a hapless house! A century since, its head, in heat of youth, Espoused the daughter of his enemy; Since when the wrathful hand of heaven has pressed Upon his line who broke the holy laws Of pact and race. All that were heirs to him Have come to ends untimely. Lil. [Aside.] Strange! his tale Sounds like a warning. Sir O. [Apart to her, smiling.] Can this move thee? Lil. [In a low tone apart to him.] No. Thou art my fate. Whate'er betide, thou'rt mine. [Oscar bends to her, and whispers reassuringly. Mur. [Aside, observing them.] Ay, whisper, whisper! Let your amorous lips Grow glued even in my sight. [Aloud, as Lilian and Sir Oscar turn to him.] My errand told, I of your goodness, lady, would entreat Short rest and shelter. Then I take my way. Lil. Take freely all you need; I ask not now That you should prove your skill upon the harp, Your journey's solace, doubtless. Ere you go I may demand a lay. Mur. Whate'er you ask, I am obedient. If the lay be harsh And the strings jar and crash, bethink I'm old, And my hand lacks its cunning. [Half menacingly.] Else I'd win Such music from the chords, the strain should dwell On your charmed ear till life itself lapsed with it. Lil. I take your will for deed. Your name? Mur. 'Tis Uric. Lil. Evan, conduct the minstrel to his chamber. [To Murdoch.] May food and rest refresh you. Mur. [Bowing low.] I'm your debtor. [Evan, bearing Murdoch's harp, goes to door. Murdoch slowly follows him. Sir O. [To Lilian.] Time speeds, and bids me haste; remember, sweet, Two hours past sunset I return. Lil. [Observing Murdoch, who at door turns and gazes on her intently.] Again That fixed, mysterious gaze! [Murdoch follows Evan out by side door. Sir O. [Smiling.] What dost thou fear? Is't strange that minstrels' eyes, alive to beauty, Should feed on thine? Lil. [Smiling, and trying to rally.] 'Twas folly, and 'tis past. Sir O. Then for brief while farewell. [Kissing her hand.] When next I come 'Twill be to claim in thee a joy so sure Nought can unbase it, and so absolute It cannot know increase! [Going. Lil. [Following him to door.] Thy voice, dear lord, Doth speak for both our hearts. Till night farewell. [Sir Oscar goes out by side door. Lilian gazes after him. Lil. [Returning from door, and sinking into chair.] The hour is fixed, the hour that seals my bliss; Yet bliss is solemn, and my heart lies hushed Like earth before the dawn. Strange, joy should wear A look that chills me. I could almost deem Again yon minstrel's gaze, that, like a cloud Enfolding thunder, veiled what still it showed, Bent, moveless on me. Lilian, shame! art thou The child of Angus? [Rising.] Angus! [Arrested by her father's portrait.] From the wall His darkening mien upbraids me, that I blend His foeman's blood with his. I'm fancy's sport. [She again gazes on the portrait of Angus, her father, which gradually fades away, and changes slowly to the spectre of Graham's wraith, which is precisely the same in appearance, expression, and attitude as when seen in first act. Lilian continues to speak while this change takes place.] And yet a horror broods in all the air, Some spell still holds my sight. Ha! now it fades, The pictured semblance fades; and now puts on Some ghastly change! No more my father, there It standsâagain the vengeful spirit stands That warns our house of danger. Is it death That now impends? [After a pause.] Stern phantom, when before Thou cam'st in thy mute terror, I was firm, Firm even to death! but now I love and fear. If in thine awful, unconjectured home Old thoughts of human love can reach thee still, [Sinking on her knees. Claim me not yet; have pity! Enter Kenelm by open door at back, cap in hand. Ken. [Apart to himself.] One last look! She knows not 'tis the last. [Aloud, perceiving Lilian, rushing to her, and placing his arm round her.] Why Lilian!â [As Kenelm rushes to Lilian, the spectre of Graham's wraith suddenly vanishes from the frame, in which the portrait of her father Angus resumes its place. Lil. 'Tis gone! [She reclines almost fainting in Kenelm's arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene.âSame as last scene of last act. Night. A lighted torch on each side of mantelpiece. The lamp suspended over the altar-piece is also now lighted. Door at back closed. Vivid moonlight seen through windows; some clouds, however, are also visible. The scene discovers Lilian seated and Margery. Lilian wears a tartan scarf of the Macronald pattern over a white dress, the skirt of which is long for riding. Margery is engaged in placing a rose in Lilian's dress. Lil. Thanks, thanks, dear Margery; you have laid out My riding-cloakâyour own too? [Pointing to riding-cloaks and head-dresses laid near. Enter Roderick from side door. His face wears a look of anxiety. Mar. Madam, all Lie here prepared. Lil. 'Tis well; when once our summons Comes, it will ask despatch. We must ride far Ere midnight, Margery. Rod. Ride far to-night? Forgive me, lady, but this sudden humour Holds not with reason. Lil. Have I not possessed you Already of the cause? The knight, Sir Oscar, Has learned that danger threats me. Rod. Humph! 'Tis well To guard you from your foes, but who shall guard you Against your guarders? How shall I answer Malcolm, That you, at stranger's bidding, quit his walls? Lil. How answer Malcolm? With my heart's dear thanks For past protection. He's my friend and cousin; No parent to command me. Rod. He's your chief And guardian of your honour. Lil. Not so, Roderick. I'm guardian of my honour. Malcolm lives His proper life. 'Tis well; but I live mine. Rod. These matters are beyond me. I but know Our chiefs by their own arms protect their women, Nor leave that care for strangers. I must tell Sir Oscar that Macronald's walls best guard Macronald's child, and that you stir not hence. Lil. Roderick, you'll ne'er say that. Rod. Shall I be plain? 'Tis love, not danger, prompts you to this folly. Ride you not to your bridal? Lil. [Calmly.] If it were so? Rod. What say'st thou? Mar. If it were so, says my ladyâ If she did ride to church, why 'tis a journey That most maids of her age are apt to take, And one I plan myselfâwhat then? Rod. What then? [Trying to assume a decisive tone. Then should I act and speak. Lil. Like Lilian's friend, [Motioning him to sit, which he does. She bends over his chair. Who from her childhood made her whim his law. What did I ask and you not grant? To ride? You led my palfrey. Would I hawk? 'twas you Who trained my falcon; and you oft would laugh Because I wept in sudden penitence To see the heron struck. Or would I sail? 'Twas you who, smiling on me from the helm, Held in the veering sheet; and will you now, Old playmateânow I venture all life's freight Upon the deep, and take the voyage whose end Is Eden or a quicksandânow I loveâ Will you now first be froward to your Lilian? Rod. My duty, girl! Lil. Thy duty is to love And help the child who loves thee. Would she 'scape To happiness, 'tis thou shouldst aid her flightâ Raise bars, not fix them; and thou wilt! Dear Roderick, Thou shalt go with me and thy grandchild hereâ This very night stand by me at the altar, That I may feel the hand that led my father When he was yet a child, in my joy's hour Rest on my head and bless me. Say thou'lt go! Rod. Strive not with women: 'gainst them man's resolve Is straw, his sternness wax. Ay, what thou wilt. Thou art old Angus' daughter. To the last I'll follow where thou lead'st, and bless my fate That I, in extreme age, have lived to see Love's crown upon thy youth. Lil. Nought shall divide us. My home be henceforth thine. But we must haste Our preparations. Where is Kenelm; seek him, For he must with us. Rod. Kenelm! You have touched On what disquiets me; though now 'tis night, He still is absent; where, with whom, unknown. I've strictly questioned; none within have seen him Since fall of sun. Lil. [With an effort to disguise her anxiety.] Why, then, he has gone forth With Donald to the herd, or else prevailed Upon our oarsmen to put out and row In the clear moonlight. [Going to window.] Ah, how fair a scene! [She watches from window. Mar. [Apart to Roderick.] Your look is grave; the boy's safe? Rod. [Apart to Margery.] Would I knew it. I've fears for him. The scarf and cap he wore, As I but now have learned, were found by Donald Some half league from the Castle. Do these signs Augur no deed of violence? You know The hate that some here bear him, and how swift A death might reach him did he purpose flight. Mar. You'll keep this from my lady. Rod. Ay, 'twere ill At such a time to grieve her, unless proof Confirm the doubt; and yet my heart is heavy For the quick step that comes not. Lil. [Returning from window, which she closes if open.] On the lake Or on the shore he must have wandered far; Or elseâhow think'st thou, Roderick?âhis great yearning For home and kindred has at length o'erpowered him, And he has fled. When last we met, his arm Clasped me in such a long and fond embrace As now seems like a farewell. If it were so, Heaven's love preserve him! Rod. Thrice amen to that; But I've an errand by this chance delayed: 'Tis from the minstrel who to-night arrived, And soon goes henceâwell that he shouldâa stern, Unsocial, silent man, whom none will miss. Lil. I thought him what you say; but oft we err. He doubtless mourns his chief untimely slain, And we have ta'en for sternness in his mood What was but sorrow. Well, what is this errand? Rod. Ere leaving he would see youâpay his thanks. He has a suit tooâsome most private suit, Meant for your ear. So much he importuned, That I have let you know this. Lil. [Aside.] Poor and old, 'Tis like he has such need as pride unbares Only to few. [Aloud.] Say that I'll see the minstrel, That I await him here. [To Margery.] Retire; and, Roderick, Press instant search for Kenelm. Rod. I'll not fail. [Aside, in grief.] Would that the lad were found. Mar. [Warningly apart to him.] Hush, hush! she'll hear. [Roderick goes out by side door, followed by Margery, who takes away her own riding-dress, leaving Lilian's. Lil. Yes, let him come. I, on the verge of joy, Should nought deny to others. Much I've wronged him. If still his aspect blends with boding thoughts Of Kenelm, and that fearful shape I saw, Or deemed I saw, 'tis but the lingering trick Of heated fancy. That full noon of bliss I else had known, too strong for mortal eyes, Heaven tempers thus with shadows. I'm as one Named for a queen, who in her ante-chamber Waits summons to the lordly presence-room. Through curtains sees the softened torchlight steal, In whose blaze stands the throne, and hears already The rising anthem; yet, her train expectant, Her foot advanced, fears lest some sudden form Should cry, Thou may'st not enter! Enter Evan by side door, followed by Murdoch, who still preserves the same disguise of dress as before, and still retains the gait, manner, and voice of an aged man. Evan. Madam, the minstrel whom you bade attend. Lil. Let him approachâwithdraw. [Evan signals to supposed minstrel to approach. Murdoch approaches Lilian. Evan goes out by side door.] Have I heard right, You leave us? [Murdoch bows deeply in assent.] You have ta'en but short repose; Were it not well to bide here till the dawn? Mur. My mission, lady, asks despatch. Lil. I'm told You have some suit to me. Mur. A suit most urgent. Lil. Speak freely. Mur. Pardon, if my words be strange. Lil. You've far to travel; sit. [Both sit. Mur. I see in you A maid betrothedâa maid who takes to-night The name of wife. Lil. How knew you this? who told it? Mur. The power which to these aged eyes reveals The sight of things to come. Lil. [With awe.] Hast thou that gift, That awful gift some in our land possess, Which bids the future cast its shadow forward, And things unacted yet grow visible? Hast thou the second sight? Mur. That gift I have. And scarce an hour since, in my trance, I saw The knight Sir Oscar lead thee to the shrine. Lil. Thou saw'st this? Mur. In my trance: ay, proud he stood, And stately as the topmost pine that soars Above its fellows; and no parasite Did round a trunk with closer tendrils wind Than thou round him: and yet I knew him false, And that you clasped a traitor! [They rise. Lil. Traitor! Nay. I were a traitor did I let thee move me Even to scorn. What is thy suit, man? Speak it, And go unpunished. Mur. That you hear me still, And, having heard, judge me for what shall follow. Brief is the sequelâto the shrine he led thee. [Gradually resuming his natural voice. There, still in trance, I saw the priest disguised In minstrel's robes like mine. Strange, he approached The pair, but not to join them! Who are ye, He cried, that come to wed? Your sires, yet babes, With mutual curses lisped each other's names; And if, in manhood's strife, on any field, They mixed in death, their very bones would stir With life's recoil. Child of Macronald! child of the Mackane! Hatred has drawn your ties as close as love's, And made your union incest!âThen I saw The priest was Deathânot gaunt and spectre pale, As women feign him, but a warrior armed To execute his mission! [He throws off his minstrel's dress, and discovers himself in the garb of his clan. He wears the plaid of the Mackanes, and lays his hand on the dagger in his belt. Lil. Whoe'er thou art, If I but raise one cry, thou diest; thou'rt mad! [Pointing to his plaid. Thy tartanâa Mackane'sâwould doom thee here. There lies a secret passage [Pointing to panel]; take that torch And fly. I pity thee, and give thee life. Mur. Life! I have staked it; ere thy cry were heard, This steel were in thy heart. [Half drawing dagger, which again he drops into sheath.] Thou art to die. Lil. For what? Mur. Thy purposed and abhorrÃ©d union With a Mackane. [Looking through window.] See yon dark ridge of cloud Bears onward to the moon? Until its light Be veiled, make peace with heaven. [Sits at table, and averts his face from her. Lil. [Apart to herself.] To die to-nightâ My marriage-night! To think when Oscar comes He'll find the lips that bore his kisses cold, And dim the eyes that cannot bend on him Their setting light! [Suddenly to Murdoch.] Whatever hate thou bear'st My kin, I have not wronged thee; thou art human! I am Macronald's child, and yet I tremble. I would not dieâI love. Ah! canst thou strike A heart that lovesâslay double life, even then, When earth seems likest heaven, and, ruthless, cast A dead joy at the gates of paradise? Hast thou loved never? Mur. Girl, your time is short. Lil. If thou hast loved, oh! think the form that blest Thy youth now pleads for mine. If still she live, By thy first joy; if lost, by present grief, Look on me; kill me not! I do not hold To life as simple life, but since I love, For love's sake, spare me! [Throws herself at his feet. Mur. [Somewhat moved, but resolutely.] 'Tis your love that's fatal. I cannot spare you, would I. Lil. [Rises.] Spare thyself! Thou art no common stabber. If my blood Be on thy hand, remorse, that ever bleeds And never dies, and vain self-loathing soon Shall be thy portion. Never shall this night Fade from thy brain; but thou shalt shuddering see My image at thy feet. My voice, that sues For pity now, shall ring within thy ear Like judgment's peal. Ay, even unconscious thingsâ Yon torch that, flickering, saw the act; yon moon, That looked in mute, and passed with its reportâ This sight, through life, shall haunt thee, yea, shall line The curtains of thy bed when Death undraws them! Mur. Think not to move my fears: thou may'st my pity. Less thy poor life I seek, than to avert The horror of this marriage. [She rises.] Thou hast said There is a secret way that from this chamber Leads to the plain. [The moonlight is now lost behind the cloud, and the windows grow darker.] Disclose it; share my flight, And live. I've friends without; their watch and mine Shall strictly guard thee; yet I'll have thine oath. [Seizing her arm, and drawing her towards altar in the oratory. Swear at that altarâby thy soul's weal, swearâ Never by craft, nor flight, nor force, to wed With Oscar of Mackane. As thou dost ask Heaven's judgment on thee, swear it! Lil. Swear to what? That I forswear myself! Thou hast seen how love Could humble me: now know that love can scorn As well as tremble. At thy bidding swear To renounce Oscar! Hadst thou power to hold My soul in torment, save I took that oath, I would not take it. I would dwell in bale And keep my truth. Off! [Shaking off his grasp.] Is it at the altarâ Life's holiest placeâthou ask'st me to disown Life's holiest good? I will not; I invoke A Power Divine to shield me. If it hear, Thou still art baffled. If it hear me not, Its altar is a spot where I may die A victim; where I will not stand a perjurer! I refuse; do thy worst. Mur. [Drawing his dagger.] Thou hast sealed thy doom. Lil. Then strike; if thou can'st slay a girlâif thou, Perchance, a father, canst smite down a child. Mur. A father! By that word thou shutt'st out mercy. In me see Murdoch, chief of Clan Mackane, The father of a son thy kin have butchered! Lil. Hold, hold! That son I snatched from death. He lives. Mur. Lives! Where? Lil. Beneath this roof; alas! he's fled. Mur. Fled! To preserve thy life, thou coin'st a lie. Summon him; bid him burst the grave and stand Before me, or thou diest! [Raising the dagger. Lil. [Struggling with his uplifted arm.] He lives! I swear it. Is there no hope? [Her eye falls on the panel door, which is seen opening.] Ha! see, it slidesâit slides! The panel slides! Mur. [Again raising dagger.] Where is my son, my Kenelm? Kenelm enters through panel, which he closes. He no longer wears his blue scarf, but, as in Act I., the Mackane plaid and the holly badge in his cap or bonnet. Ken. Lilian! Lil. Kenelm! [To Murdoch. There, there, behold him! [The cloud passes, and it is again moonlight, which falls full on Lilian's face. Mur. Heaven! 'twas true. He lives, he lives! [Extending his arms to Kenelm. Ken. [Rushing into Murdoch's arms.] Father! Mur. [Sobbing, and wildly embracing him.] My boy, my boy! [After a pause. Who saved thy life? Ken. There stands sheâLilian! Mur. Then thou hast snatched me from the heaviest guilt That e'er weighed down a soul. [Throwing himself at Lilian's feet in supplication.] Oh, pardon, pardon! [Lilian gives him her hand, which he passionately kisses. Enter Sir Oscar, bursting open door at back. His squire, page, and retinue are seen waiting without. Sir O. [Aside.] 'Tis as I guessed. [Slowly to Murdoch.] Why art thou here? Mur. [Rising slowly.] But now My hand was on her lifeâ Sir O. Who saved thy boy! I met him flying from these walls. I stayed him, And learned his story. Having missed you from us, Suspicion flashed on me of your intent. I, riding with my squire and page, my clansmen At some short distance following, straight enjoined The lad by shorter paths to speed on hither. He came in time; he stayed your blow. We're brothers; But had that blow been struck, thy life or mine Had issued on our swords! Mur. [Repressing his tears.] Oscar, these tears Of contrite joy have cleansed my brain from madness. If I may yet atone, I thus would strive. [To Lilian.] The father, thankful for his son, forgets Macronald's child, and humbly sues to thee For sister's love. [To Oscar, joining his hand with Lilian's.] She's thine. Sir O. [To Murdoch.] In bonds thrice blest, Since thou hast knit them. [To Lilian.] Through thy life, dear love, Such joy flow ever as now swells my breast! [Sir Oscar and Lilian embrace. Ken. [Plucking at Lilian's dress.] Lilian, 'tis as I said. He's come back wounded. Cure not his hurt this time; shut close the cage. Lil. [To him fondly.] Though thou dost merit chiding, I'll not chide. Enter Roderick and Margery by side door, the latter in riding-dress, followed by two retainers of the Macronald bearing torches. Rod. All, lady, is prepared: your horses wait. Lil. [To Kenelm.] Thou hast fulfilled the omen. As the phantom That threatened Lilian at thy coming fled, So now Death flies before thee. Thou hast saved Her who saved thee. 'Tis life for life. Thou wear'st Thy father's badge and tartan! Ken. These I wore When first made captive; flying, bore them hence; At distance from the castle I cast off My bonnet and my scarf, and re-assumed The ensigns of Mackane. Mur. 'Tis realâno dream; My Kenelm speaks! [Embracing him. Rod. Kenelm! a weight of ice Melts from my heart; yet whose the arm that clasps thee? Murdoch's our foe! Lil. Our foe no more. This hour Macronald and Mackane together league For their own rights and Scotland's. Faithful friend, Who in thy time hast seen such bloody feuds Of our fierce races, thou hast lived to see Their unionâhate the tale of what has been, And peace the truth that is. Thy blessing now! [She bends her head. Roderick reverently places his hand on it, as in benediction. At a sign from Sir Oscar, enter his squire, page, and several attendants. Torch-bearers turn towards door, and prepare to marshal the rest. END OF LIFE FOR LIFE.</field>
