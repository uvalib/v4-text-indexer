      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MRS. J. WILLIAM WALLACK. With Europe victor o'er the braggart Czar, With wars and rumours echoing from afar, Our happy England, long intent on peace, Improves the arts she won from Rome and Greece. There, in old time the drama held high state— And here to-night claims audience not less great. The Muse's temple to our hopes restored, Freshly adorned, doth entrance new afford, Re-opes its gates, and cheerful welcome gives To all who joy to know—the drama lives: A race as fair as free, as brave as good, Derived from Heaven's best house, of earth's best blood, Whose minds by Shakspere nursed, by Milton taught, Know well to weigh the worth of wit and thought. To you, who speak the language that they wrote, We shew their works, with some of later note, And thus, appealing to your better taste, Ask that no more the stage may be disgraced By vulgar themes that souls refined detest, And seek your favour only for the best. Thus would we still the art of acting raise, And challenge only where we merit praise. If you approve, and recompense our aim, We'll win for theatres their ancient name; But if our efforts no response receive, Not ours the fault, if “the judicious grieve.” With comic grace, or tragic force, be ours The task to please and move the spirit's powers; To you the laughter and the tears pertain, That prove our task has not been plied in vain. While proud Pauline, or Julia errs to mend, And the true wife finds in her lord her friend; While for her sire the daughter all resigns, Or Arden's forest bears Orlando's lines, Or Love, in Knowles' fair countess, stoops to rise, Or Otway's heroine maddens ere she dies, Or Scotland's thane ambition's promptings sway, Or Portia walks in duty's safer way, Or Imogen rests in her husband's truth, Or Juliet perishes in passion's youth, Or Ion sacrifices life and love, That he from Argos may the curse remove: While scenes like these, by masters painted well, Pass, pageant-like, each with its mighty spell— Resist not you the charm, because too strong, Nor pine for dalliance with an idler song, But mindful still of Britain's bardic fame, Let your hearts kindle with the muses' flame, Whence, purified or cheered by either mood, By melancholy or by mirth subdued, Attending “thoughts that breathe and words that burn;” When falls the curtain, and you home return, Then may reflection show that this our stage, If wisely used, tends to reform the age, Softens the heart and elevates the mind, Chastens the stubborn, makes the kind more kind, The virtuous still more virtuous, fair more fair, Imbuing still the common with the rare, Till all, with the poetic spirit rife, Exhibit beauty in their daily life. To-night a theme, well prized in days of yore By bard and statesman, skilled in elfin lore, From the choice legends of our native land, Treasures pathetic, terrible and grand, We have evoked—and lo, it now appears, Awaked from the long sleep of buried years— A “Briton moniment”—whose student reads Our soil the faërie's own—our heroes' deeds Those of the mighty, dauntless in their will; “Argument worthy of Mæonian quill”— So call'd by Spenser; and by Milton told, That poets by their art might more unfold In after-times, and grace these stories rude With fancies rich, out of their gratitude. So Shakspere thought; and, lo, upon the stage Paternal Lear, the monarch-type of age, Uprose sublime, and won the tragic crown From Greek and Roman brows, to deck his poet's own. By his example fired, and with like spells, We too requicken from dead chronicles A tale of wonder and of terror—such As may even yet those deeper feelings touch By which we recognise such truths as aim At all we must believe and cannot name— But which, once smitten, link the earth and sky In one full song, one solemn symphony, And shew each heart it may no secret hide From him whose soul the muse has deified. Such is the drama's aim; such our's. The bell! [Bell rings. The Play will soon begin. Till then, farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A SMITHY OUTSIDE A PALACE. A Smith discovered, standing, meditatively, beside his anvil, with his hand on the hammer. During the following conversation he retires into his forge, and brings thence a golden crown, which he proceeds to burnish diligently. Enter Porreo and Enyon. Porreo. My brother, the prince Ferrex, gave to the page, Philander—is that his name? Enyon. So they call him. Porreo. You saw. Mind that! Enyon. Doubt not. I saw it—with my proper eyes. Porreo. Nay—smile not! You saw my brother, the prince Ferrex, give to the page Philander a fair letter, charging the boy solicitously to convey it to the hand of my betrothed Marcella? Enyon. The politic Dunwarro's daughter— Porreo. Fiery angers! hide in the heart! Enyon. So be it. Let me state the argument. Porreo. Proceed. Enyon. Thou art the second son of Gorbudoc, the potent monarch of this our valiant isle of Britain. For a slight blemish of nature, which, in his royal esteem, misfitted a polished court like this of Trinovant, the prudent monarch consigned thee to the care of the wise and venerable Clotyn, Duke of Cornwall, in whose far-removed halls thou wert instructed, till the defect which banished thee was (though unknown by thy distant father) happily in great part mended. Porreo. Be quick. Enyon. Meanwhile, Dunwarro, son of Clotyn, being widowed, and desiring business to supplant a lonely sorrow, seeks here the court of Gorbudoc, leaving old Clotyn's, but still entrusting his daughter, during his own absence, to the guardianship of her grandsire. Thou and she thus grow and are taught together, until affection ripens. Suddenly, Dunwarro commands his daughter hither. What follows? Porreo. This! My presumptuous brother takes on him, moved by Marcella's report of my proficiency, to call our royal father to account for my banishment. Couriers are sent to all the different counties and provinces of Britain—one reaches Clotyn's court, demanding of the too-old duke to take his share in judging the matter. The sage duke consents to send his image—despatches the courier, and then, secretly disguising me as a herald, cunningly appoints me his missive. Enyon. Wherein his motive is right evident. But touching thy brother's and her father's motives—(plague on this state craft!)—room there is for much suspicion. Smith (singing). Said the King to the Smith— Porreo. Hark! We are disturbed. Enyon. Let us retire to the grove yonder. Here they are to pass. [Exeunt. Smith (sings). Said the King to the Smith— “Man, thy limbs lack no pith;” Said the Smith to the King, “Sir, these thewes are the thing.” But the King answer'd straight, “'Tis the head saves the state; But old Iron's out of date, Match me Gold for my pate. Here is gold. Make a Crown, Worthy Royalty's frown.” Said the Smith—“Then, I fear, That the metal's too dear, Or to weld or to wear.” During the above, enter Dordan, unperceived. Dordan (in a feigned voice). That is a good song. Who made it, smith? Smith. Why, Dordan, The jester of the court. Dordan. That fellow is A poet. Smith (looking up). Why, it is thyself. O Dordan! The work is almost done. Dordan. What dost thou, smith? What's left to do? Smith. Please your wise mirth, the burnish That finishes the golden diadem, And makes it ready for the consecration, Which the impatient King is hastening on; And has even now sent to me that pert page (Philander I do think they call the boy), With message to prepare myself and it For the procession soon. Dordan. Thine old trade, smith, Was better than thy new one. Smith. May that be? Dordan. It wrought the richer metal! Smith. How is that? Dordan. Your iron is a richer prize than gold. Gold will not plough a field, nor dig a mine, Nor point a lance, nor make the battle sword; But iron will. 'Twill get what is worth more Than gold; since gladly men give gold for grain, And win the gold itself from cave and coffer. Smith. True, jester. 'Faith, I like not this new business— Not I, for my part—niggling, peddling work! A sturdy stroke on a good iron anvil, With a sledge hammer, that is what likes me: A thump like this. [Striking the anvil with a hammer loudly. Dordan. Have mercy on my ears! Smith. Thy ears! they have no taste for music then. Dordan. Have? they have nothing—therefore, they have all. Smith. A perilous paradox. Dordan. He who has least Is richest—that is, richest of the poorest; For who has nought he is the only rich, Rich in the way of excellence, truly rich. Rich absolutely, infinitely rich. Smith. Resolve me this. Dordan. If he live on without Your gold, your silver, and your precious stones, Your sumptuous dresses and your royal feasts, And want them not, content with what he is; Then in himself is he a man so rich, He can afford to do without their aid. Or if his nature he extenuate, So that he die, he shows a mine of wealth That hath no need of any worldly thing, Not even the body that he cared not for, And left in scorn to who would bury it! Smith. Why, he, methinks, were greater fool than thou. Dordan. Not greater, smith! but fool almost as wise! Smith. Well! So thou thinkst the King himself is poorer, Now that he hath this crown, than ere he had it? Dordan. Yes; for he hath two crowns, and will give away, For gold, the iron. Smith. See, Philander comes. Enter Philander. Dordan. Boy! Philander. Fool! Dordan. Fool! Philander. I? Dordan. A boy's a fool. Philander. As how? Dordan. Thy question shows it: he who asks a question Shows ignorance of what he asks about, And he who's ignorant is but a fool. Philander. Yet, if by asking he can answer gain, 'Twas wise in him to ask that he might know, And knowledge make him wise. Dordan. 'Tis nature's wisdom, Not thine—and mightiest in the weakest. Women And children both are curious, both be fools. Philander. What both? Dordan. Both; yet is nature wise in them. Philander. Then nature's wise in me? Dordan. Yes, pretty child. Philander. Child! Dordan. Scorn it not. 'Tis a great thing That manhood seldom matches. Childhood's faith Believes in all responses, and hence learns— And, confident, proceeds to seek again, By wonder, and the passion for the new, Still urged—still satisfied! But manhood chills The fount of admiration—ties itself Within the bands of custom, and deceived Or else deceiving, lives to doubt of all things; Nor will be taught, though it too little knows. Philander. Why, then, the child's the wiser. Fool! thou'rt caught— Hadst thou been curious as a boy must be, According to thy pretty theorie, My business here thou wouldst have questioned me. [Rhyming. Dordan. I guess. The sage Dunwarro and his daughter, 'Tis known, are passing soon. Thou hast a letter From princely Ferrex to the fair Marcella. Philander. They come. How shall I now, in secret wise, Commend this scroll to her sweet hands and eyes? Dordan. How the knave rhymes! The fool shall stand thy friend. Enter Dunwarro and Marcella. Dordan. Hail to thy wisdom! Dunwarro. To thy folly, greeting! So now make way. Dordan. Thy pardon, sir; but fools Can ne'er make way; they always lag behind-hand. Dunwarro. What wouldst thou, fool? Dordan. Know why thou callst me fool. I know why thou art called the wise. Dunwarro. Then mayst thou Why thou art called the simple. Dordan. Marry, may I? Then I'll resolve the point, though it be knotty. [During the following conversation, Philander delivers the letter to Marcella, which she reads. Enyon enters, and observes the action, but immediately, making a threatening gesture, retires.] Dunwarro. Thou art tedious. Dordan. I'll be brief. I am simple, sir, Being natural. They call a fool a natural, And therefore call me simple. 'Tis my simplicity That makes me love the fields, the trees, the brooks, The flowers, the rainbow, and the moon and stars; Think they are something; trust both man and woman, My fortune and the gods! Dunwarro. The fool's a poet. Dordan. The poet is a fool: for while he lives On the ideal, as on air the lizard; He leaves to grave Dunwarro, with bent brow, To frown mankind to silence, lest they lie When they do speak; to walk through wondering ranks Cloaked in stern pride, apt to dispute all truth, Decide all controversy, and despise Instruction, pleasure, and whatever breathes Of purer being; yes, to you he leaves The world ye are sure of, for the heaven ye seek not. Dunwarro. Be witty, and not moral. Dordan. How! not moral? Witty, not moral? why, your moralist's Your only genuine fool. Smith! thinkst thou not 'Tis evil in thee, being a peaceful man, To mould the tools of death? Smith. Why, what know I More than the miner who the metal delved? We work in our vocation. Dunwarro. Silence, sirrah! Divest thee of that coxcomb! Vex no more The nicer manners of our modern times With antics coarse and stale. We need them not. Dordan. Most gladly I submit; hoping the state Hath now no office which a fool doth hold. Dunwarro. Begone. Dordan. Philander, come. The time's unfit— Meet is both knave and fool the statesman quit. [Exeunt Philander and Dordan. Dunwarro. Smith! for the anvil and the furnace! In— In, to the labour which I set thee now. [Exeunt Smith, Dunwarro, and Marcella. Re-enter Enyon and Porreo. Enyon. What we have seen confirms it! Porreo. Yes; the letter Prince Ferrex gave the boy, he gave to her. Enyon. Prince Ferrex wished thee home to mock thy wildness. They're leagued to wrong thee: from thy birth they've wronged thee, A monarch's banished son. By what right wert thou, Though rude of mien and slow of tongue, despatched, An alien, into Cornwall? Now, returned, Behold Marcella, by thy elder brother, Won from thy vows. The fraud is flagrant, burns With shameful glory, glows and glares with horror! It was from her he heard of Porreo's change, But little still he knew the graceful herald, From Clotyn's halls, was Porreo's self. This sleight I counselled; and another let me prompt. Come! thou must doff this garb, and show again Like a King's son. Time presses. I'll instruct thee. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —STATE HALL, WITH THRONES AND COUNCIL-SEATS. Enter Dunwarro and Marcella. Dunwarro. Marcella! Marcella. Father! Dunwarro. What is it thou hidest? Marcella. Nothing; at least 'tis nothing I would hide. Dunwarro. What is it then? Marcella. A letter from Prince Ferrex. A noble youth that for his brother hath Made noble stand, though 'gainst his kingly father. Dunwarro. Marcella; 'tis for children to submit. Thou lovest Porreo, and Prince Ferrex thee; These motives prompt him; hence he takes the cause That is his brother's. Marcella. Nay—the purest, father. He leaves me to my liking;—smit by virtue, He swears to do no wrong, nor see it done. Hence with the King he deems it meet to plead That he remove the cloud which banishes His younger brother from the capital, Civility, and learning, and the court. Dunwarro. The Council soon assembles. Better I Were pleased, had weightier matter formed the theme Of argument to-day. A state so rude As is our Britain should postpone all private To public needs. We yet lack laws to rule us; Temples and cities and the ways to them Cry loud for privilege of sanctuary; And to the plough that turns the earth to profit Like honour I would grant. Need, too, there is Riddance of thieves and robbers were secured, That peaceful men pass to and fro with safety. Marcella. The Prince approaches. Dunwarro. And with Hermon too, His friend. I will but place thee in the gallery Of the court, where thou mayst hear this trial, daughter— Then make me ready for an actor in it. [Exeunt. Enter Ferrex and Hermon. Ferrex. 'Tis she! I must not follow! Hermon. Wherefore, Prince? Ferrex. I may not trust my fortitude of mind, Nor rush into temptation. Man's resolve, In presence of her beauty, melts to passion, And the brave heart dissolves the frosty chains Wherein it has been bound. Hermon. Thou hast resigned her! Ferrex. I have performed a painful duty—but The thing that's right, why 'tis the thing that's right. Hermon. But not the most expedient. Thy brother, Porreo, Thou wouldst recall to court; not knowing how His presence might divide a father's love, Leaving thee half of what thou hast now the whole— If that the half be left thee, since, in this, Thine opposition to a parent's will May wake his wrath. Ferrex. I fear not, cautious Hermon! The right is the expedient. There be gods Who recompense man's deeds. Jove governs not So laxly his great empire, that the good Should go without reward. Hermon. But how know we That what seems good to us is so to them? And, verily— Ferrex. Nay, verily—I've weighed All fairly in the scales; and, to be frank, Feel reason to expect some gain will fall To my partaking, for the generous purpose That holds so even nature's mystic balance, Not even Dunwarro can assign the motive That's heavier of the twain! Enter Eubulus. Good secretary— Meet soon the Council? Eubulus. Prince, I come to tell thee, The princes have arrived who should compose it. There is Staterius, Duke of Albany, There's Imner, Duke of Loegris, and Rudaucus, The Duke of Cambria. But Clotyn of Cornwall Sends word he is too old; nor can his presence Be needed, since his son, Dunwarro, here, Can represent him aptly; and besides, From long acquaintance with his court, hath skill Transcends his sire's, in local statesmanship. Ferrex. Dunwarro? Yes! 'Twas he advised that Porreo Should to the Duke of Cornwall be despatched, So nature's error in his realm remote Might find a veil that polished Trinovant Refused to furnish. But behold! the King, My honoured father, with his court and Council. [Flourish. Enter Albany, Loegris, and Cambria, in attendance on the Queen (Videna) and the King (Gorbudoc). Dunwarro follows behind. The King and Videna ascend the throne, and the Court is arranged on each side of the stage. Ferrex, in the centre, kneels at a distance before the King.] King. Princes, whom Heaven has given to me and mine, For pillars that support the policy Of Britain, like a temple;—list ye now To what my son—my first-born and the virtue Who, when I die, this sceptre well shall wield, My successor in this improving state— Hath to propound unto your grave decisions. Cambria. O King! I speak for all—that our knit souls Are lieges to the motions of thine own, And echo the dread oracle they serve. King. Now, princely Ferrex, to this solemn court Reveal what suit thou hast unto ourself. Ferrex. O royal father! pardon let me crave That not to thee alone, but, in this Council, I dared appeal. Not that I feared the truth, But that thou wert a party to the cause, And wouldst, I knew, in such fair wise acquit Thy honour, that assembled voices should Bear witness to its triumph. King. Party?—I!— Ferrex. I have a brother— King. Ha!— Ferrex. Boys once we were Together. I loved him as my mother's son Should love my mother's son;—and so we grew. But I was quick of speech, and he was tardy. 'Twas nature's blemish,—true,—a stammering lip,— And yet no fitting cause for banishment. To me thou gavest education—means For profit in the manners of thy court: Him didst to savage Cornwall send away, Far, far removed from all appliances That might amend defect, and make him fit For princely state,—though he was born to such. King. Ferrex! my eldest born! arraign me thus, In frequent hall, for what, on grave advice, My royal wisdom ruled?—The unquestioned gods Less gifts vouchsafed thy brother than to thee, And wholly some denied him—and, in fine, Marked him for rustic both in mien and accent. But it behoves a monarch to heed well The gloss of custom;—and this infant state To nourish with a special providence. For if at all good manners may obtain, The court must first their garden-soil become, Whence they transplant themselves, like wind-borne seeds, To ruder fields, nay, to the common heath. —Not for injustice to thy brother, sir, But for the general weal, for social ends, And what the sage for sacred have pronounced, Have we removed him for so many years There where his nature might find kindred solace, And make him happier than our court could make him, Our court meanwhile made happier by his absence. Videna. My gracious consort! Let not anger ride On wingèd words against thy noble son— The generous Ferrex. This, his natural love For younger Porreo, to my heart speaks home— The mother can interpret for her son! King. Let him speak on. I'll listen patiently. Ferrex. Still must I press my suit, and prosecute The same to a decision. Fair Marcella, Thy daughter, sage Dunwarro, late arrived Even from thy father's halls, where Porreo bides, Can well report that he is not, in sooth, Unfitted for the state that he was born to. Dunwarro. I do confess as much, my sovereign liege! King. Disputest my honesty, or my discretion? Ferrex. Neither, my royal sire. But time full oft Is lord of wondrous changes;—sometimes imps The creeping worm with wings, and what was coarse In glory arrays, like Iris,—or like Psyche; So beautiful, that fitting type it were Of the great soul herself. Thus, on my knee, Before a father reverently I plead An injured brother's cause (kneeling). A Voice Without. Make way, there! way! I will have way! [Enter Porreo (followed by Enyon) flourishing a drawn dagger. He rushes to Ferrex, while kneeling, and points it at his breast.] Porreo. Withdraw the unfilial plea! Or to thy heart, whose will revolts against A father's will, this poniard I compel. King. And who art thou, imperative stranger! thus Who breakest on the Council of a King, In guise so rude and sudden? Who art thou? Videna. Speak! Tell a mother's heart it doth not lie! Banished so long—yet—yet—I know, I feel, Thou art my son! Porreo. I am thy son, O Queen! Thine am I too, dread King! and would approve it In my obedience ever! Ferrex. Thy coming's apt, And thy bold presence better pleads for thee Than all the words I've used; and yet, methinks, Less violent propulsion might have served Thy need with me, than the close poniard's point At the warm heart was pleading thy behoof. Porreo. Less thine; who mightest to a father's ear Have privately enforced it; nor even so Until my wish was known to have it so. Ferrex. If it were not, the missive from the Duke Might have conveyed thy wish; and thereupon I had withdrawn my suit. Porreo. Myself am he— For when my royal father's couriers came To Clotyn with his mandate for this Council— I prayed him to send me, that I might set Great Gorbudoc at large from this impeachment, And vindicate his wisdom. [Videna regards Porreo with marked suspicion. King (descending from his throne). Hither! hither! Porreo! my son! rebuke thy brother not! Paternal deities! your pardon now, That I have Porreo wronged! [Enyon, on a signal from Porreo, here exit. Porreo. Thou hast not wronged him! In Cornwall's court I found a foster-god, Who reared another pupil for thy service, Though hard the task with one so rude as Porreo. King. So rude? so civil! this is passing strange— Pride now is glad in thee, my princely son! —Now, Ferrex! I will bid thy generous heart Leap up with joy at the amends I'll make, Worthy a king, in error who has injured. Half my dominion I decree to him North of the Humber—to thyself all south. Well may ye reign, and spare me further toil, Who both have shown, as brother and as son, Such duteous love. In you may peace confide, Between you the sweet charities commune! [Ferrex, as if stunned, stands in deep thought. Videna. With more than a queen's welcome, princely Porreo! With all a mother's passion, I receive thee— My son! my son!—Yet while I am glad, I grieve That he, thy brother, who thy coming furthered, Should for his virtue lose what thine has gained. King. Nay—'tis ill thought, Videna! trust me, 'tis! The generous Ferrex deems it not a loss, But in his brother's gain rejoices so, His half is double all. I know him well! Come, Ferrex! come—thy brother's hand in thine! Porreo. Brother! I thank thee, now the cause is passed, And claim thy mercy for my violent humour. But 'tis our Cornish fashion—so I thank thee! Ferrex. And I no churlish welcome give to thee, Beshrew me if I might. Nor know I now What is my due, or praise or blame, for deed Which, if fraternal, was unfilial— But, an' events interpret Heaven aright, I fear me, censure only. Videna. No, my son! I read it, as its sybil, and pronounce That herein it would teach us, virtue looks To it alone for guerdon, or herself Hath in herself all the reward she can. King. A true conclusion. Let the court break up— And, after feasting in acknowledgment Of this great bounty, we will nothing lack That may our purpose seal right speedily. [Exeunt. As Porreo is following, enter Marcella. Marcella. Stay! 'tis Marcella sues! Porreo. Marcella! Marcella. Porreo! Porreo. Rejoice, Marcella! thou shalt be a queen. Marcella. Only in rightful sway can I rejoice. Porreo. Is that not right a royal sire bestows? Marcella. Not on a younger son, while lives the elder; More wrongful, if his life be good and gracious. Porreo. By heaven! thou lovest him! Marcella. I love him, Porreo, As thou shouldst love him—as his brethren should! Porreo. No more? You're sure of it? It may be so. Often small sign denotes great cause. At eve, Look cross the sea, a narrow rim of light, Along the horizon's edge, implies the moon Hid somewhere in a cloud. Marcella. What hide thy words? Porreo. Cursed be the hour you left your grandsire's court! Marcella. Thrice bless'd, since thus new virtue I have witnessed! Porreo. And I wild ocean from the pensive shore Have watched, with eyes of one who seeks a wreck! I felt, when thou wert gone, my vagrant heart Was as a vessel which had lost its pilot, And might not weather anger. First time, then, I thought with pity on the storm-tost man, Driven to that coast for shelter. Well I knew, In haunts more polished thou wouldst scorn rude Porreo! Marcella. Thou doubtest as thou doatest, still too fiercely. Now hear a soothing tale. Prince Ferrex loved me— Porreo. I guessed as much— Marcella. Thou never lovedst me! Porreo. I? Marcella. Then thou wouldst hear me! Porreo. Hear thee, false one? Speak! Speak! Marcella. Yes—with tears—and do thou listen gently. Ignorant how I was in thy heart enshrined, He saw and loved me. Then I told him all: How worthy thou—how, by my grandsire's skill, Accomplished in the arts thy nature shunned— Then he resolved to right thee; then, with pangs That tried his nature sorely, to thy claim Resigned the maid he wooed. Porreo. Ignorant I loved thee? He deemed me all too rude to prize such beauty! Insolent ignorance! The maid he wooed! And might have won—but for—I'll prate no more! Absent, I have never known him as a brother; Present, what motives me to know him now? [Exit. Marcella. I gasp—I cannot breathe—the horror darkens On my strong fancy's eye. Do I not know The Cornish nature well? Inspire me, Heaven, With swift prevention! Ha! Right welcome, page Enter Philander. Philander. They are at high festal there! The brethren, lady, Twin-kings, are at the banquet. Marcella. I remember— It peereth from the blank that came upon me! Philander. Sweet lady, art thou ill? Marcella. Philander, no— 'Tis there, like an imagination shown In some reflecting clearness; such a shadow As oft pervades the waters; a strange dream Mirrored within the visionary mind! Philander, no. Nay, I am very well, My pretty page. But I should list, unseen, To see the banquet thou hast lauded—couldst Stead me in this? Philander. My wit is dull. Marcella. Thus grave? Philander. Why not? my soft Minerva! Know ye not Your ladyship's father makes it now the fashion? Dunwarro sets the style—and the poor wit Is needed less than ever now at court. Gross manners are reformed, and the Old Fool Is growing obsolete with the Old King, Who, that he may seem young, becomes the new one! Marcella. Aye reverently speak of royalty. Philander. Royalty! that parts with an iron crown, When one of gold's a-making? Marcella (abstractedly). One of gold? Philander (surprised). Your ladyship's memory grows like Dordan's folly, From sympathy— Marcella. How's that? Philander. Into disuse. I mean, my lady, that great gift of gold Duke Clotyn sent with thee from Cornwall hither, To grace thy presentation at our court. My Lord Dunwarro counselled straight the king To have it moulded to a modern crown, Would better grace his brows than one of iron— The which to see, thyself this morn did visit The honest smith, while labouring at his task, Making it ready for its consecration. Marcella. That treasure cast by shipwreck on our coast? Strange, I forgot it; but now, just now—I Can think of nothing that has been, intent On what is, or to be. Philander. Of course; the past, In these reforming times, is the forgotten, And the new wisdom puts back the old folly. Marcella. Not so, pert boy! I need it even now. Philander. 'Tis at thy service ere the asking. Marcella. Come, then, Philander, thou wilt stead me? Philander. Marry, will I! [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A BANQUET HALL. King, Videna, Dunwarro, Ferrex, Porreo, with the several Dukes, Dordan, and others, discovered seated. King. This crown having between you parted, sons, Jove grant ye wear it well! Dordan. That wit were well, Methinks, that could demonstrate, mathematically, How two heads might, at once and in two places, Sport the same cap. Dunwarro. Please now, your majesty, Were it not seemly at this solemn tide, A licence, by late manners ill permitted, As my poor judgment goes, were mute for once? King. Dordan, we need not thee. Go forth! [Exit Dordan with a dejected air. Yet apt it was What he propounded—but herein have we Provision made. To Porreo we can lend This iron crown; while, Ferrex, for thy brow The golden round preparing we reserve, As to the elder due. Videna. My royal Lord— 'Twere ominous to superstitious mind, The younger should to full possession come, While the duped elder, for his unreft half, Should hold it only in reversion still. King. Fair Queen,—why, with a mind foretelling evil, Division make where peace makes one of twain? Porreo. Mother—misdoubt me not. Nor need I care my brother now were crowned; Waiting would gain my brows the richer show. Pledge me, good brother; give me of thy cup, And take thou mine. Thus, to the bottom, I Drink to thy health, in love for thee as true As thine for me. Ferrex. My love for thee has been In no faint show avouched—nor am I slack To meet thy pledge. Thus, then— [As he is about to drink, Marcella enters, and taking the cup from his hand, pours forth its contents on the ground.] Marcella. Pernicious draught! Sink to the centre! Shudder not, O earth! As deep into thy veins the venom filters! [All rise. Porreo. Confusion! Ferrex. Fair Marcella! wherefore this? Marcella (pointing to Porreo). Ask him!—If in his eye no conscience lingers, Then he is guiltless— Porreo. Me? Why question me? What magic's round me? influence in the air To madden men and maids? Ferrex. I know not, Porreo, Whether assumed, or not, this wonder be; But take this maid with thee unto thy realm, As queen of thine estate, and part we now As brothers should. Marcella. O, never, never! Porreo. She says well— Never! Take her to thee who, with witch-charms, Hast snared a heart her choice had pledged to me! King. Gods! Whence has grown this strife? Retire, Marcella! [Dunwarro and Marcella withdraw up the stage. Are ye my sons? Am I your father, late So happy in your loves? Which of you woos Dunwarro's daughter? Ferrex. She is Porreo's bride! Porreo. 'Tis false! She is thy mistress! King. Jupiter! But I grow wroth! This jealousy doth lack All basis for its standing. In my presence The maid has walked, as if Diana's self; And Ferrex' honour is a priceless gem! Thy father is a witness for them both! What! think'st thou that the court of Trinovant Is as a Carthaginian cave, for sheltering Impatient lovers in a thunder-storm? Come—come! I see the manners of the coast Blind thee to ours. We live not here, as they Who couch among the rocks that barrier The liberal tide of ocean. Thou must learn To know us better, Porreo! Nor think, now, I chide thee. 'Twas my fault that suffered thee To grow up far away from our acquaintance, Which soon will give thee cause to mend opinion Too suddenly conceived. Porreo. I do begin To see my error. I confess my failing. But I'm of hasty mood, and must be doing. Would I were north o' the Humber! Business there Would drive these fancies from me! King. Heaven speed thee! We doubt it nothing. Now, Videna, come— Our state shall pass from toil and travail free, Of royal care unrobed . . a fiery vest, Such as besieged Alcides with hot pains— These we are quit of! Videna. May the gods forfend, That seeking peace too soon, we haste not on the end [Exeunt all. SCENE II. —GROVE NEAR THE PALACE. Enter Dunwarro and Marcella. Dunwarro. Thy father's prudence I perceive in thee, Who of a doubt a certainty hast made, At least on safety's side. Marcella. The sacrifice! To me Prince Porreo now is lost for ever! He'll not forgive what I could not omit! Dunwarro. Herein thou shouldst have sought my counsel first, Who warned thee against loving, though not much, Not dreading much his influence, form or manners— But time has bettered . . . Marcella. No—my grandsire's skill— Nor took I slender care to woo him on To gentler arts. Dunwarro. Marcella! my sweet daughter! How like thy blessèd mother, when she lived— A flower that made elysium of the earth— Soon lost to me, my child! What could I do, But leave thee, an infant to thy grandam's care, While here at Britain's court I shook off grief, In chasing fortune? Ah! how oft the love Of this world's power or goods is but a mock, Hiding the countenance of that other world— A world of holy sighs, of secret tears, And thoughts whose consecration is a veil More sacred than a vestal's. How now, Philander? Enter Philander. Philander. The queen would see Marcella. Dunwarro. She shall come. [Exit Philander. Marcella! to thy duty. I'll to mine. [Exeunt at different sides. SCENE III. —A CHAMBER IN THE PALACE; AT THE BACK A SPLENDID CURTAINED ARCHWAY. Videna and Ferrex discovered. Videna (walking up and down, much agitated). By the adorèd sanctity of Justice! I swear thy father hath much wronged my son— My eldest born!—My indignation boils Within me, though repressed!—Wronged thee, for whom? My son, I grant him too. Methought I loved him, When first he stood before me. Can I now? Tell me, great gods!—was poison in the cup? Ferrex. Marcella knew not; 'twas suspicion only. Videna. In her suspicion, jealousy in him; A cursèd bridal, were they wed together! Enter Marcella suddenly, and kneel to Videna. Marcella. Pardon, dear lady—beauteous majesty! The innocent cause of strife 'twixt princely brethren, I prostrate at thy feet this worthless form. Ferrex. Up, from the ground, thou maiden paragon! Videna. That strain no more.—She is thy brother's vow! His jealousy at least must have no cause; As little thy suspicion, fair Marcella. Marcella. Stern as he is, my heart is yet his own. Videna. I trust it is;—else were my younger son Wronged all as much by thee, as by his father My elder is. Justice supreme be worshipt! And I will prove if he be child of mine In soul as well as fleshly lineaments. The project is prepared that shall essay him;— (Thanks to the wit of Dordan, whom we know, A better man than to the most he seems)— If of my mind he be not the true son, He shall be of my wrath! If reason sway not, Let passion rule!—rule thoroughly! Half means, Half ends, for fools! I've sent for him. He's here. [Videna and Ferrex retire up the stage. Enter Porreo. Marcella (rushing to him). Speak not a word until thou list to me! What have I done, that thou shouldst spurn me thus? What crime have I committed? Porreo. Crime?—what, thou? Thou'rt innocent! too innocent! I'm sad At heart, Marcella! Marcella. Thou art calm again. Porreo. Calm as the sea, reposing from the blast It loves, as I love thee—to war and death! But these rough moods suit not their courtly manners; And I thank much the instinct guided thee To spare me groundless vengeance. I believe My royal father's word, that thou art pure! Marcella. Pure?—was there then— Porreo (interrupting her). My royal mother sent For me to attend her hither, ere I parted. Videna (coming forward with dignity). And now awaits the homage of thy knee. Porreo. Thou, and my brother?—spies upon my wooing? Spies on the unguarded utterance of my heart? Videna. Low-thoughted man, who knowst Videna not— Incapable of aught may honour stain; She lives in ether thou hast never breathed. Porreo. Thy pardon, lady; I have not had the means Of knowledge long. Videna. Woe worth the truth thou speakest. Yet no long knowledge, none indeed, was wanted; The guiltless bosom dreads no listener— The guilty soul to think should even fear, For the most secret gods our thoughts can hear. Porreo. Now it comes back on me; all that so late I had set free my soul from. Watched and springed, And she the engine. She, who snared my heart, Set by my brother and my mother on The scent. False, I do swear. False in her wish, If not in deed. 'Tis plain as these two hands— Hands, I have hands—nay, nor am I unweaponed. [Rushes frantically upon Ferrex. Thy heart shall show me of what hue it is— I'll judge it by its blood. Videna (to Ferrex). My part is here; not thine. (To Porreo) Nor this the greeting I did hope from thee, When I desired thy presence, in the faith That, to my reasons, I should find thee pliant; A generous offspring like its parent stock. I now call on thee to forego advantage By chance obtained, and win her praise whose love Was born with thee; and now, on thy return, Yearns to complete the circle long deferred. Ferrex. My royal mother, let him keep the half The realm my father has bestowed on him; For if he give it back I needs must spurn it, Ungenerous to receive as to refuse— I feel that never more it can be mine. Porreo. It shall not be. Marcella. O Prince, believe Marcella. Richer wert thou to her, a stainless man, Than were the crowns of earth upon thy brow, With shame upon thy cheek. Porreo. Poor should I be With all the crowns of earth and heaven to boot, Could false Marcella now be rich in me. Videna. Hard man art thou to say it—fierce and cruel. Take her unto thy bosom, and confess Her love more worth than twenty thousand kingdoms. Porreo. I will try one without it, please you, lady. Videna. Pitiful scorner, to thy father's robe I'll cling in menial supplication, till He yield a right decree. Thou knowest him not. His spirit, clear, heroic, and sublime, Believes not in earth's evil, least of all That aught of such could issue from his goodness— Hence, thou art trusted, as he would a god, Being himself a god, in all but fear, Suspicion, and distrust. Think him not weak, Or thou mistakest him. That to the carnal Appears as weakness, which the moral knows To be the strength of heaven.—Let it be proved That thou art worthless— Porreo (with sudden coolness). Mother, I am warned— Videna. Warned? (Trumpets.) Hark, he comes. Enter King, in procession, with Dunwarro, the Dukes, Philander, and the Court, also Enyon. King. Here, Princes, they are found— The Queen and her right-royal progeny. We know that she had redde their presence here, And have made bold to guard King Porreo forth In honour. So, with valediction proud, We shall pursue his steps, far as we may, On the glad road that leads him to a throne. Videna. That throne, great monarch, ne'er let Porreo mount; The king in office should be king in worth. King. What now, our queen?—why should dissention be? All quarrel hushed—all terms made free and plain— Know we not that our eldest fairly grants What we have gladly promised? Ferrex. Father-king, Ill would it me beseem to stop thy bounty; Worse ill to him, my brother. Be thy gift Thy gift. I have no choice to say, Reclaim it. King. By bright Apollo, and it shall be so. The word of a true king is very truth, And as the truth immortal. Never mine Shall die, not even as dies in the soil the seed, But flower without corruption, deathless birth Consummate in conception, and at once Burst to a godlike life. Most just Videna, Grace our procession with thy port of pride. Videna. Here will I stay; and here stay thee with me,— So long as thou wilt listen to the peal Of my loud speech, which I do wish were thunder, For Britain's sake, and thine. King. Thunder's not reason, But anger—and that's madness, or divine, Or human. Reason is the spirit of The soul, that speaks, with still small voice, the truths Too fine for mortal ear, yet audible— Mind lists that spherey music, and looks up, And sees the starry light, from which come down Its all but silent prophecies. Videna. Not silent! The harmonies of reason listen now! Sound, music! [Music behind the scenes, and Song. 1. Ancestral memories, shine With light divine! There's joyance and might In the gleam of your light! 2. Our fathers! let their name Be their son's fame! Thought is throned on their brow— Man! behold! worship now! [Curtains unfold—present an illuminated circle of statues, representing the Kings of Brutus' line.—1. Brutus, with a bow, having just sped the shaft. 2. A group of three, Locrine, Albanact, and Camber. 3. Locrine, Guendolen, Estrilda, and Sabrina. 4. Malim, Mempricius, and a Wolf. 5. Ebranc. 6. Liel. 7. Leir and his three daughters.] Videna. Keep ye silence! All be mute! Look, Porreo, look, ere thou departest hence, Upon thy royal ancestry, thyself About to be a king! Of them whose blood Is in thy veins 'tis fit thou wisdom learn! Behold great Brutus, from old Troy renowned, The son of Sylvius—who, by error led, Came to this land, then savage Albion, And quelled the giants that its wild woods roamed: For his unwitting shaft had slain his Sire; Wherefore, 'tis said, his line shall one day end, When heavenly vengeance, for that hapless deed, Shall finish, and the Parent slay the Son— 'Twas thence these toils he bore, that Fate might find Scope for its will, arena for its act. Porreo. His story lacks, methinks, of good example. Videna. Irreverent boy; religion contemplates The inmost soul, not the external bearing. He was the Founder of the state of Britain, Loved by his friends, and dreaded by his foes, Whose first misfortunes only made him greater, Gave him to wife Italian Imogene, Whose three fair sons thou seest. There Locrine, There Albanact, there Camber, who in peace Ruled o'er the land. King. Thus rule ye, O my sons; Coheirs of empire! Porreo. Witness for me, Brutus. King. 'Tis fairly sworn. Videna. Right valiant deeds were theirs, 'Gainst Humber, Hunnish king, whose name still bears The river wherein the invader sank. But ah, Estrilda, his fair captive, won On weak Locrine, though Guendolen's espoused, The great Corineus' daughter, he whom Brutus Found near the Tyrrhene sea; a Trojan famed, Who with Antenor entered Italy, Tamer of monsters, victor over giants; Of whom our legends a grand fable cherish, How, at a solemn feast beside the shore, Broke on the Britons' mirth a savage crew, Led by Goemagog, who, the rest conquered, Reserved for wrestle with Corineus, Seized, and aloft swung the brave chief, thus breaking Three of his ribs. But he, thereat enraged, Heaved the strong bulk, and bore him on his shoulders, Throwing him headlong shattered from a rock, Since Langoemagog, into the sea. Porreo. A giant's leap, indeed. A worthy feat, Which still in Cornwall we do celebrate. O, that my foes were thus within my grasp, Thus bravely should they suffer my resentment. Videna. Nay, nay, my son; take rather warning thou From Locrine's tale; on whom his Queen divorced Made justest war, wherein the King was slain, His leman and her daughter likewise drowned, Fair Sabra, in the Severn's thence-named stream; Hence fear thou to do wrong, albeit a King. Be ye like Madan—be ye most unlike Malim and bad Mempricius, fratricide, Whom wolves devoured. Look ye on Ebranc's form, And cities build like him. Look, too, upon The second Brutus, who redeemed the loss His father had in Gaul. Look, too, on Leil, Who peace enjoyed while he maintained the right, And fell to discord when he fell to wrong. Now, turn at once to Leir and his three daughters, Of whom Cordelia well may claim your love;— Think, Gorbudoc, of Leir. King. I think of him Who did unwisely, trusting woman's word. But Brutus, our renownèd ancestor, Confiding in his sons, was justified. Porreo. The lesson that my fathers read, I learn With all humility. Men were they all, Some weak, some strong. Videna. Lost—lost is he who deems His sires of old not gods. Removed from presence, Their memories are divine; and, in our hearts, The motives, too, that prompt us piously To virtuous deeds, lest we dishonour them. Porreo. Who sometimes yet, since opposites cannot Be alike virtuous, oft themselves dishonoured. Videna (in agony). O, ye great gods! lost, lost to piety, With me is lost to hope. Burst not, my heart, And, my big soul, restrain thee! King. Wrong him not, Videna! Blind belief is witnessed null; Discrimination is not evil doubt. Videna (rushing into the semicircle of the statues, and kneeling in the midst). O thou long line of sacred ancestry! Ye royal fathers! Race of godlike Brutus! Heroes and demigods! O pardon me, That I call not the thunder down—but nature Is strong in me for them in whose veins flows The blood that was in yours! But well I note The ominous anger on your clouded brows, That he who lacks of reverence should divide The crown that they have sanctioned! [Rises and comes forward. Thou, Marcella, Plead with me. King. 'Tis too much! Marcella! Nay, Thy lover shall, despite thee, be a King, Were it only for thy sake, thou virtuous maid. Let him but reach his realm, and form his court, And feel him safe upon his local throne, Then claim the bridal, which, I promise him, Shall be most prompt and happy. Porreo. To thy will, Most royal father, I submit myself, In everything obedient. Nor lacks aught, But that my mother's blessing on my knee I crave, ere hence I wend; for I would not Her state diminish so, that, for my sake, She now should tend on me, or show herself In chafed mood abroad. King. 'Tis ill—'tis ill— Make clear thy queenly brow! I marvel one Who is, as 'twere, the Astrea to this orb, Should let her star be quenched in our rebuke. A waywardness most strange. But we are man; Whom woman rules is none. What, rebel still? Shame to thy state. An unsubmissive wife Makes disobedient children. This example's [Videna stands in a fixed statuesque attitude of offended indignation.] Of evil auspice. Come, bestow the boy His blessing. Porreo. When my Queen and mother shall Have known me better, she will proffer that Which now she pauses o'er. I'll rise, great King, And win, ere long, by merit, such a blessing, That summer showers upon the thirsty land Shall be to earth but as the winter's snow Upon the ocean's foam. Mother, farewell! Farewell, my bride! till fate evolve the time For which my bosom pants. Brother! Ferrex. Thy way I'll honour, Porreo, with our royal sire, And his return defend. King. A duteous thought. Let the loud trumpet blare—the train move on. [Flourish. Exeunt in procession omnes, except Videna and Marcella.] Videna (gradually recovering). He has gone forth without his mother's blessing. Marcella. He has gone forth without his maiden's promise. Videna. Motherless—lovelorn—have we let him go. I could not find a blessing in my heart, I could not bring a blessing to my lips. There are no tears within my marble orbs, There is no pulse within my bloodless veins; Cold, cold, and still I stand. A wife's authority Outmatch'd by a son's cunning. Pride, thou'rt shamed; Matron prerogative, thou art disrobed; Fool! 'twas my woman's babbling cautioned him— Warned! was he warned? Warned—warned— Marcella. O righteous queen! See, in thy son, my lover. Frequent duty, In me, shall render compensation full; So, taking me for him, thou shalt not lack Of reverence one mere jot. Nay, I will be Thy path to tread on, soften it with tears; The tresses of my hair— Videna. Upbind thy tresses— Thou art a foolish maid, whom I will love. Let my hair fall, who am dishonourèd; Whose mother's pride is stung by her own brood. —O most brave anger! To my chamber, in— In—in—Marcella, ere the train return, And see me weeping. I am still a Queen. [Exeunt. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —NORTH OF THE HUMBER—INTERIOR OF A PALACE. Enter Porreo and Enyon. Porreo. Thou art not his brother. Enyon. No—nor am I thine; Yet I am more—thy friend: and if aught, short The being born of the same parents, makes A brother, the communion of our lives Might authorize fraternal fellowship. The rugged soil we trod from boyhood up— The savage moors, the granite tors, the streams That, from the vapoury mines, the surface trench, Hills, dales, and rivers, with the barrier rocks That coast the ocean, like to palaces, Arches of triumph, columns of old temples, The abodes of sea-gods, nymphs, and demon-powers— These witness to our loves. By stone and circle, Whether of sport or sepulture, and both, I swear, and, by their memories, attest The honour of my faith. A brother, quotha? Would I have won from thee, while thou wert absent, Thy heart o' the world? Porreo. Marcella! where art thou? Enyon. In Ferrex' arms—on Ferrex' nuptial couch; Glad of the distance 'twixt the south and north— They there, and Porreo here—a wifeless king. Where else should be Marcella, who loved once His brother, and now him? Days, weeks, and months, Have passed—no tidings yet.— Porreo. Brother?— Enyon. Why, yes. 'Tis witnessed oft, our kindred are worst foes— They have looked so closely and often on our faults, All from the purest kindness to correct them, At length they see them only, and thence see nothing But what they should, and do, most heartily hate. Porreo. Ah, Enyon. We have not thus familiar been. Enyon. Then it is instinct in him. Ye were born To show how brothers can abhor each other. It is the fate of both—a charmèd sea, Which ye would sin against the gods to stem, And, if ye dare, will drown you. Porreo. Born such foes? Videna's sons. Severe is she, not cruel. Her tears might flow not—but her frowns would slay— Enyon. Thee;—not thy brother. Is it not avouched He hath her love, her tenderness, and thou, The majesty thou pratest of—the cold state— The lip of scorn—the speech of apothegms. Porreo. Thou understandst her not. Like her, am I, In many things—my fierceness and my pride— Softened, in her, to matron dignity— Hardened, in me, to man's austerity, That will not be denied. Enyon. But love best loves Dissimilars; and were it not so, justice, Which thou hast said in her is paramount, Votes for the eldest, and long household wont Enforces equity, with sentiment That preassures the verdict. Porreo (with deep emotion). Out on it. Alas! my feet are known not at their hearth; My hands are strangers at their daily board. There was no chamber set apart, no bed For me was cherished in my father's house. Evil grow on this evil. Enyon. Muse on this— Partners, or rivals, now, in empire are ye? Allies or powers opponent? Can ye trust In one another? Can ye live in peace? Be sure, that he already mans himself 'Gainst chance and peril, lest the half that's left Follow the half that's gone— Porreo. Ha!— Enyon. And, perchance, To win again the lost, which may be found If vigorous search be made, and time should serve The bridal of occasion, when the torch Of Hymen shall show light. Porreo. It never shall. Never shall he deprive me of my love— I am resolved. Impetuous blood, boil on. Throb, my big heart. Impatient brain, work—work— And swell, my brows, to bursting agony. Arms he? I'll arm. Occasion shall not wait— Marcella shall be mine. She shall be mine; I'll put the golden crown upon her head, And make it all as glorious with her beauty, As with its own. Then shall I reign—reign—reign. Enyon. Ay, now again I know thee. Porreo. Dost thou, Enyon? And thou shalt know me better. In my soul The sacred thirst of power hath appetite, Capacitied at once. 'Tis as a gorge In a ravine approached too suddenly— I start in fear and wonder—but not long— For there it is, and must be fed with horror. Surprise and death brood laughing o'er the gulf; It yawns—it shall be satisfied—though it swallow Not my foes only, but myself. Come, death; Come, hell and ruin; let but vengeance come. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —OUTSIDE THE PALACE, as in Scene I., Act. I. Enter Dordan and Philander. Dordan. I'll play the fool no more. Philander. The fool has lost His lady-love, and so would lose himself,— Become a monument on Beauty's grave. The smith, her father, made of sterner stuff, Grieves not like thee. Dordan. He has a task—I've none. Jove, when he gave to every mortal man His occupation, left the poet idle, That leisure might bring wisdom. Shall he sigh? Grave muses win no largess. Shall he turn The laughing sage, or look more grave than sage, That they who be no sages may laugh more? They think him that same fool they make themselves. It boots not—thriftless boon. Philander. Methinks this jest Is far too serious. Dordan. Pupil mine, it is No jest. Philander. Not meant a jest? Dordan. No, by my troth. What said I? That the smith, my maiden's sire, Hath occupation, still denied to me? Yea, honour also. Even to-day the King Will consecrate the golden crown he made, And now will bear aloft, partaker in The proud solemnity. I may not share it; Excluded, as profane, from the dread temple Even of the god who made me what I am— Divine Apollo. But they know me not; Know not the man within, that he without Doth hide. Philander. Nay, take not on so. Dordan. What, and if They knew him, 'twould be still the same. Yes, if The poet in his loftiest attributes Appeared, in small regard would he be held. Shut from the temple? A time comes, when the poet, Free-born of soul, the zealot shall prohibit A niche i' the national temple for his statue. An evil day for both. Philander. Grief for thy maiden Hath changed to sorrow for thyself alone. Dordan. One grief has taken both, myself and her. From court excluded first, and now from sanctuary, No business for me in the world is left. This second grief is parcel of the first, Which first slew her. Though lowly was my place, Still 'twas a courtly office, and, poor girl, She prided on the courtier in the jester, And pined herself away in the disgrace Of his dismissal, fading day by day, Until no bloom was left upon her cheek, And the pale rose was withered with the red. Philander. She died of melancholy—so wilt thou? Dordan. Nay, I have made me business. Seest thou not My travelling cloak is on? I've been a journeying— I love my King, my country, and my God, Howbeit neglected, or however wronged. I've news—sad news for Britain. Now, my boy, A bargain with you. Soon the palace gates Will ope and let the long procession forth That shall attend this day's solemnity, The consecration of the golden Crown. Philander. What then? Dordan. I'll follow thee to the temple, though Forbid myself to enter. Sooth to tell, I'd rather wait without. Attend, Philander, My motions at the gate. Be at the porch; Should I absent me for a time, fear not, But watch my coming back. What I've to tell, Mayhap, shall much import. Philander. I shall obey. Dordan. Retire. The train come forth. The King, the Queen, And all the court, adore the golden crown, Though worth but half of what the iron swayed. [Music. Enter, in procession, Smith bearing the golden crown, &amp;c., as in the next scene, and then exeunt. Dordan and Philander follow. Loud music.] SCENE III. —THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO—the veil down over the statue and altar. Loud and triumphant music. Enter, in procession, Smith bearing the golden crown, Dunwarro, Marcella, Ferrex, Hermon, King Gorbudoc, Queen Videna, and many others, with Philander. Enter a Priest to them. Priest. Here pause awhile, until it please the god Withdraw the veil from his mysterious shrine. King. Priest, willingly within the antefane Our progress stays. In reverence we wait The leisure of the gods. [Exit Priest. Dunwarro. 'Tis wisdom's part, O King, to cherish prudence. Wherefore this Delay? Videna. 'Tis but a solemn ceremonial To make the consecration seem more sacred. King. Videna, seem? Dunwarro. Your majesty says well— Why aught that only seems? Gods, to my soul All fraud is adverse, even pious fraud; Though in the undisciplined, unsuspecting youth Of the yet schooling world, advisedly Promoted—but with years increases caution; And manhood scorns deception as unuseful, And insolent withal. King. Wise saws are these, Dunwarro; whereto tend the same? for, sure, There are no pointless epigrams from thee. Dunwarro. I hope not, good my liege. Time well I deem Most sacred of all powers, nor would profane Or idly waste his gifts. King. Speak thy conceit. Dunwarro. The oracle, my Lord? King. I would inquire, As I have cause for doubt, if the division Of empire be decreed as happily To prosper, as 'twas honestly designed. Dunwarro. And they may fit ambiguous responses, Not of the god, but pleasing to the King. Such practice hath been witnessed. King. Hath it so? And are there, Heaven, who minister thy temples, Hirelings, in thine all-hallowed name, who trade In falsehood? Sleep thy thunders? Have the clouds Quenched the red lightnings in their treacherous folds? Or sits a lie on the transcendent throne? Dunwarro. Truth sitteth there, whereto this knee doth bend In lowliest adoration, as beseems. But priests are men, and men are sometimes weak, In virtue or in courage. King. In this strait What counsel wouldst thou give? Dunwarro. Recall the priest, And, with such questions as the god inspires, In his own temple, test his honesty. King. Page, bid the priest return into our presence. [Exit Philander. Videna. With pious trust I hold this caution needless; Yet will await the trial, calmly sure The god will vindicate his minister. Re-enter Priest. King. Priest of Apollo, weighing well thy office, As thou wouldst answer to the god himself, Resolve me, whether, here, we rightly seek What anxiously we pray for? Priest. Rightly—if The truth ye would inquire—not flattery. King. How will the god reply to our demand? Priest. Even from the tripod which yon veil conceals, With his great altar and divinest image. —We but await a vestal to ascend The sacred seat, then in her soul the god Will enter and reveal the will of fate. Dunwarro. My daughter's even as such. King. Most true, Dunwarro. White as the winter's is her maiden wreath— As free from stain, as pure from evil touch— Nay, as the tresses of the sun-god's hair, Or as the very essence of his eye, In radiance unpolluted, unapproached. Videna. And let the Queen speak in her favour too. Chaste as the violet in the early spring, Yet not I hope too early, though the earliest Be aye the chastest . . . . chaste as they are young, The sisters of the snow-drop lately dead. King. The god himself shall render proof of this. Priest of Apollo, may she serve the shrine? Priest. Most surely, gracious King; while, on the altar, The crown is consecrating, there she'll sit, Awaiting inspiration; and that done, She'll feel the god within her, and so speak. King. Fairly consented. Sweet Marcella, thou Hast heard. Marcella. With trembling heart, yet innocent, But awed with this great duty, I submit— Both to my king's appointment, and my sire's. Videna. Heroic maiden, blessings tend on thee. King. Go bravely, with thy monarch's benizon On thy young duteous head. Dunwarro. Thy father's, too. Take her, right-worthy priest, and fit her, instant, For this religious office. Now, if ever, A guileless prophetess may challenge faith. [Exeunt Marcella and Priest. Videna. Ferrex, my son, why standest thou so rapt? Why gazest thus on her departing form? Ferrex. Half of my kingdom were well lost for her. If thus the gods decree my recompense, I grant their equity they vindicate, In ample retribution. Videna. Hush, my son, The place is holy; be it thine to wish Thy brother had been present at this trial, That heaven's own fire might cleanse his jealous breast, When all the god glows in her. —But lo, where The veil unfolds. [The veil draws up, and presents the altar and image of Apollo, with Marcella seated on the tripod. All kneel.] King (taking the crown and approaching the altar). O fourfold sacred power—and yet most one. Sole source of harmony, and (being one) Prophet divine of truth, whose freedom is The health of all the worlds, the light, the life Of all the suns—far-shooting, arrowy god. Thy fourfold holy benizon we pray Upon the golden type of royal power; And since of nobler metal than of yore The mystic circlet shows, be that great thing It represents more procreant of true glory— The truth, the peace, the plenty, of the land. [Disposes the crown on the altar—the Priest sheds incense upon it from a censer, saying— With fourfold blessing be this crown Enriched. God, shed thy blessing down. Fear let it dart, to quench all strife, Comfort to them, who love its life— Truth in its beams most clearly shine, And peace dwell in it, as in thine. Marcella (rising, as if inspired). The gods are wroth. Be this the token— The iron crown shall all be broken. They keep the golden for their own, Till peaceful it shall reign alone. [The veil drops before the altar and crown—the image and the Prophetess. All rise in alarm.] King (after a pause). Doth no one speak? Videna. The gods—in yon pale missive, Who enters now. Enter Philander. King. Philander,—why so wan? Philander. The priest did bid me watch the temple gates; When Dordan, all in haste, and casting from him Impertinent speech, as 'twere a slough he tired of, Or which the time tore from him, bade me in With sorry news, ill-fitted for a jibe. Ferrex. With sorry news. Philander. Thy brother is in arms. King. Porreo in arms? 'gainst whom? Ferrex. Against his brother. I knew it would be so. Return, and tell him We are prepared. King. Prepared? The gods, indeed, Are wroth, are very wroth. O Ferrex! Porreo! Lift not your stubborn hands 'gainst one another. Ferrex, behold thy father; pity him. Ferrex. I MUST defend myself. (Crossing to Smith). Smith—mark me, sirrah; Thy sturdy hand must change its craft once more, And work in iron—steel—the glorious steel That flashes, like the sun-light, vividly In the proud hero's eye. The bright sword, smith, Thou must make sharp; the spear-head must be keen; The helmet and the hauberk must be true— For war hath put the clarion to his mouth, And blows ere long the blast. (To Hermon) Now, Hermon, I design to profit well By the gods' teaching. Hermon. Thou wilt trust to something More stable than thy former good intentions. Ferrex. I'll take the means that worldly men like thee Give warrant for. No more I'll walk in air, But on firm earth. Be thou assured of this, My faithless brother—that no more I lose Kingdom or mistress, even unto thee. [Exeunt Ferrex, Hermon and Smith. King. Must? It is true. What have I done amiss? The horses of the sun have gone stark mad, And reel along the heavens. Old earth reels too, And all is out of balance. Have I drunken The cup of madness in my lusty youth, And with a grinding rule my people swayed? The poor have I oppressed? Or thou, dread Queen— Hast thou been false, and brought me for thy brood The seed of wolves? O fool; it cannot be. I read the proud reproaches of thine eye— Videna, pardon. No, I am royal yet, One of the line whose privilege it is To be more wretched than the rest of men— A crownèd misery. [Falls into Videna's arms, supported by Dunwarro.] END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO, as before. The veil raised, King Gorbudoc kneeling at the altar, Videna and Dunwarro, the Priest in the back-ground. Videna. Hadst thou but heeded my soliciting— King (rising). It had been to recall my kingly word. Videna. It had been thus; and may not Kings repent? King. Alas, no more than gods: and they are gods, Yet human; wise, but not all wise, and err Like other mortal seed. Who reign, should be Gods altogether, not in part. O for The measure of their excellence. But earth Has never yet beheld a perfect King. Dunwarro. Hath Heaven? King. 'Tis right. Nought but old Fate is pure, And gods and men and nature bow to it, The ineffable, whose will is never known Till acted. Haply, some forgotten charm Attached to that wrecked gold, concerning which Thus destiny becomes oracular. May we not pluck it from the altar here, And cast it to the waves wherefrom it came? Priest. 'Tis holy now, and hath, thou sawst, been taken Into the gracious keeping of the god, Who, as I deem, for thee preserves it so Till this great strife shall cease. Videna. He speaketh well, My royal Lord. This priest hath spoken well. For Fate on such things hangs not its high will, But on man's own; therewith it worketh what It works, and therefore holds us liable For whatsoe'er results; hence, blame we not Calamity, but proper indiscretion. King. A bitter physic givest thou to me, Videna. Videna. O my Lord; I speak the truth. Dunwarro. Lady, it may be better than we think. For it appears Philander's complete news, As told by Dordan, has this further scope— That, hard upon his heels, a herald came, Haply with words of peace, to compromise The differences at issue. Well it were Your majesties should now advantage ye Of this same holy place wherein ye are, For your protection. War even would not venture To violate this sanctuary; and here The herald would be shielded in his duty No less by this pure roof than his good office. Priest. 'Tis wisely counselled. There may ye repose, And of the type and diadem of power Keep sacred guard yourselves. [Priest takes the crown from the altar and places it on Gorbudoc's head, who kneels.] Within, there is A chamber that is fitting. King. Lead. We follow. [Exeunt. Dunwarro (manet). There comes, I see, Marcella with the herald. Enter Marcella followed by Porreo, disguised as a herald. Porreo. May I depend upon thy faith? This garb— Will it prevail to save a friend of Porreo? Marcella. The herald still is sacred; and this place, My father's presence, too— Dunwarro. I pledge my word That thou art safe, though thou wert Porreo's self. Porreo. Though I were Porreo's self? Marcella. I know thy voice. Porreo. Then know my countenance. See, at thy feet Thy lover kneels. He comes to claim the heart Erewhile was his. Marcella. Ere he conceived ambition. Porreo. Ambition—I confess I have ambition. I pant to see Marcella wear the crown Her beauty merits; such as well befits The daughter of Dunwarro. Dunwarro. Tempt not me, Young man, with such suggestions. Porreo. Why, I thought Thou wert a statesman. Dunwarro. Thou hast said it, boy. A statesman, who is worthy of the name, Is one whose heart is as the seat of truth; Whose mind is as the sacred house of law; Whose will the chamber of all equity. The graces that in other men are single, In him are but integers of his virtue; Which is a thing so perfect, so complete, He has no other interest but his country's. Thy wild desire would wound her womb with hoof Of battle-steed; and with the scythèd car Would mow, like rankling grass, her patriots down, And make a desolation of her fields. He is no statesman who could help thy cause, Though its success might crown his daughter Queen Of entire Britain on both sides the Humber. Cursed would she be in such a King as thou, Who needest such a statesman as the base Alone esteem—a selfish tool of wrong. Porreo. Are thus my proffers flouted? Rail ye thus As at a traitor? Why? Because enforced To claim the maiden stolen from my heart. Dunwarro. By whom? Porreo. By Ferrex. Dunwarro. Treacherous pretext For this unnatural strife. Most vain pretence. Seal but thy peace with thy too generous brother— She is thy wife, as she was thy betrothed. Marcella, go, discover princely Ferrex, And, with such influence as in thee commands him, Conduct him hither. [Exit Marcella. Porreo. Wouldst thou, sir, betray me Into the power of my enemy? Dunwarro. Thy enemy? Thy brother. Fear thou not His honour, as I answer it with mine. Porreo. Thine? his? And by what magic charmst thou him? The spell of her sweet looks? And shall I bear My rival ushered by the maid I love? Why—look I like an idiot, that thou deemst I can be cozened with a trick so gross? Dunwarro. Have patience. Enter Videna. Videna. Whence this noise? What man is he? Porreo. Thy son. Videna. Ha!—But be hushed. Thy father sleeps. His sorrows have in slumber found repose Within yon chamber. Do not waken him; Unless, as thou dost wear the herald's garb, Thou bearst his peaceful message. Porreo. O, my mother, Why have I not in thy capacious heart That equal share of love a son may claim? Why to my brother art thou so profuse, Supplying him with comfort from the spring, And scarcely leavest a narrow rill for me To drink at, though consumed with mortal thirst? Videna. I am not now in mood to brook reproaches; Therefore, reproach me not. I am thy mother; And with a mother's fondness cherished thee, An infant at my breast; unwillingly Was reft of thy dear presence, and of thee Sweet memories in thine absence still conceived; Nor with less warmth my heart expanded then, When, in thy manhood, suddenly these eyes Beheld thee well-accomplished in all graces, Beauty of person, eloquence of lip, Demeanour bold, and royal heroism— What hast thou lost to passion, lust of power? What glory, passing that of earthly kings, What riches, all the treasures of the world. Porreo. Mother, I may not understand, perchance, The fashion of your court; yet have I learned Something—since nature taught me in this frame There beat a heart as haughty as my brother's, A wit as able, and a soul as brave. I read no law of inequality, That told me I was subject, he was King. Videna. Poor is the spirit that's not rich enough To fancy virtue higher than its own— 'Tis poorer than the brute that worships man. Porreo. Because the man of higher order is— Brute unto brute is equal—man to man. Less than a god shall not be King to me. Videna. Resign thou, then, the crown thou hast re-received, That thou be not a King to other men. Porreo. Behold my answer. See, my rival, there, Led by my mistress. Enter Marcella and Ferrex. Sir, well met. But first, Renounce that hand—'tis mine. Ferrex. Not till withdrawn. Had it not willingly been placed in this, It had not wooed me hither. Porreo. Shame should scorch it, If that unasked its unreluctant palm Dared cope with thine, reluctant. Marcella. Wherefore, Porreo, Should it be shamed, by all fair means, to teach Thy brother's hand, raised 'gainst thee by thyself, Once more the way of peace? Porreo. I want not peace. War only can expect to reconcile The enmities that were engenderèd Of the same mother. Videna. Here she is. Repeat Again that impious calumny. Thou liar! War reconciles not, but destroys,—'tis death. But it was life I gave to both of you— Life from the fount of love. Porreo (leaping on Ferrex, and seizing him by the throat). Art thou not, too, A liar? Though thou speakst not with thy tongue, Speaks not thine heart as mine? Ferrex. Unhand me, Porreo. Porreo. Not I. Videna. Unhand him, heathen (seizes Porreo). Enter the King. King. What, again! Once I beheld thy weapon at his heart, And (fool) believed thee honest. Now, once more, Thy violent hands are on thy brother thus. I dreamt of this—I had a dream of this— While slumbering on the couch in yonder chamber; And thou art here even as I dreamed. Thy brow, It has a name of horror written on it. On thy allegiance, quit thy murtherous hold. Videna (rending him away). As well cope with the she-wolf as with me. More than a woman's temper wakens here, More than a woman's strength. Marcella. Vehement Porreo, If thou hast loved me ever, hear me now Implore thee for thy good. Be placable. Calm thy resentment; seek for pardon. Porreo. Pardon? Here, Ferrex; take the serpent from my feet. —But, as thou venturest nigh to touch her only, Beware lest vengeance grasp not both, and stab, Stab one heart through the other. Dunwarro. It shall not need— I take her from thy person. Porreo. What art thou? Dunwarro. Her father. Porreo. What is that? My parents, sir, Have Madness for their son! [Exeunt Dunwarro and Marcella. King. And what have ye, Sons, for your father?—Whom shall I acquit Of what has made his head grow bald with folly, Which wisdom should have silvered?—Both of ye, O disobedient and rebellious men, Are children of Astonishment and Terror. Ye are justly punished both. Ah, Ferrex, Ferrex, Who wert the first to violate thy duty, Thou hast been justly paid—by him, whom thou Preferredst to thy father. Ferrex. My dread sire, Thus humbly on my knees, I pray thee, hear A plea so righteous that, before Apollo, I give it venturous breath. Who knoweth not What dreams, though waking, had beguiled my youth With glorious shades of virtue, unattained By mortal man. I grant by Heaven, yet still I was deceived; and recompense is none For generous purpose. Fair the vision is, But false. King. No, son. But thou wert faithless—feared To try that to the end, which will be tried Full oft till death; and what it here denies There treasures for us—in the glad hereafter. Think.—Canst thou vouch thy motive was so pure, As righteously might challenge instant guerdon? Porreo. No, 'twas, be sure, as foul as 'twas unfilial. Ferrex. Thou seizedst once on me—Now, false ingrate, Defend thyself. [Draws—Porreo also draws, but the King throws himself between them.] Porreo. Come forth, my trusty sword, My hand shall pledge thy hilt. Marcella be The bride of Ferrex, if Marcella will. But Porreo shall wed thee. Come forth, my bride Of steel, thou bright and beautiful. I've loved Thy flashing smile full long, my own betrothed, The chosen of my heart. Impatient thou, Thy plighted love were wedded? There, pale maid, But, anon, radiant blushes glow on thee— Thou art panting, now, for glory. Our love-bower, All roses, blooms. Sweet, thou'rt unveil'd. I burn, In gazing on thy naked loveliness, Whose dower is blood. King. Thy father's! Sheathe your swords Here in your father's heart. Sirs, ye wound not Yourselves so much as me, who gave you life— Ye clench at your CREATOR your foul fists, And smite the image of the god, religion Commands ye worship. Not a blow ye aim, But makes Apollo shudder with remorse; And his fine sympathy, dwelling in me, With agonistic pains of gory sweat, Threatens my dissolution. Ye care not, Though all the angry words, ye cast together, Be pointed arrows in your parents' hearts— Though every scowl, ye bend on one another, Swell as a black cloud there, and burst in thunder Within the last recesses of their souls. Ye care not, though your mother, where she stands, Stiffen to marble, and grow speechless with Passion too big for utterance. Shame, oh, shame, I muse that it should burn not through your cheeks, Calcine the lashes of your eyes, and molten Into twin jelly globes those orbs themselves, Swimming in fire, consuming and dissolving,— Nay, that, like liquid fire within the blood, It melt not through the marrow and the flesh That's in and on the bones, with bones and all. Sure, shame should thus reveal himself in you, A god, like Jove, when arrogant Semele Perished for her presumption. What's the spell That fascinates my vision? I'll not gaze On you to see your blasting. Never more Would I fain look on either. [Exit. Porreo. Brother, I go. We meet again in battle. Ferrex. I fear not thee—thy prowess nor thy skill. [Exeunt at opposite sides. Videna. Am I indeed a she-wolf, and but guelved When these were born? Ferocious impulses Speak to me from within, and horrible Suggestions make my heart a charnel-cave, Where creatures loving carnage meet to revel. Re-enter the King. King. Gone? Have they gone? Videna (solemnly). They have—worse foes than when They met. King. Can I help that, thou speakest thus With emphasis? Videna. With emphasis? King (angrily). Yes—echo; With intonation, as if, from the deep, Thou calledst, with a charm, the fiends of strife. Why, with that dim upbraiding look, gaze on me, Videna? Videna. Gaze on thee? Wherefore art angry? And why with me? And what avails it here? For am I not accursèd in my children? And what can thy wrath add to that affliction, Or Heaven's own plagues themselves? Come—rail and rave, That it may turn the current of my soul Into less bitter channel. Try it now— And own how vain thy age's craftiness (smiling hysterically). King. Thou laughest at me, even thou, Videna. 'Tis true, I am thy elder; but not much— Some few years;—nor am I, like Clotyn, old To a miracle:—nay, am still, or was, a day Or two ago, a vigorous man; who, but For love of his two sons, might still have held, For many years to come, with no slack hand, The sceptre; and may yet this golden crown Wear as my own. Videna, nay, Videna, I'm not so old, that thou shouldst laugh at me For a despisèd driveller. Videna. Ha, ha, ha! (laughing hysterically.) King. O, agony, what force is on thee now? Pray, Jove, thou craze not. Videna. Ha, ha, ha! King. Videna, Weep—weep; laugh not, Videna. Videna. Ha, ha, ha! (she falls—King stands petrified with pity and terror.) [Scene closes. SCENE II. —FIELD OF BATTLE. Men cross, fighting. Trumpets sound. Enter Dunwarro, Ferrex, and Soldiers. Dunwarro. O dire effects of civil war. Thy brother Loegra abets, and Cambria, with their Dukes— But Inmer's men lie dead upon the field, And Cambria now has with Albania leagued, To meet us in fresh battle. Will it please thee To heed my counsel, Prince? Ferrex. When turned I ever A deaf ear to thy wisdom? Dunwarro. Once—or these Mischances had not been. Ferrex. I see my error— But spare me thy rebukes. Dunwarro. Here then we part— Thou to the left, and I unto the right. Make onset thou on these confederate hosts With thy whole force; whiles I, with my six hundred, Inquire my way where Inmer's men lie slain. These found, their bodies yield their armour up, In clothing for my troop, whom, thus disguised, Will I guide on to where the enemy Think themselves most secure; assault them there, Ere they detect the feint, and, that achieved, Rear high my ensign for thyself to note, Even from the opposite quarter of the field; Which seeing, take new courage, and confirm Victory by instant action. Ferrex. Wisely planned. Dunwarro. Now then to work. March on—these men are mine. [Exit. Ferrex. These, mine. I have no heart for this day's work, Yet is constraint upon me to perform it. [Trumpets—exeunt omnes. SCENE III. —ANOTHER PART OF THE FIELD. Enter Porreo and Enyon. Porreo. Enyon, I am well pleased with thy suggestion. It shall be so. Let all the wells be poisoned, That he who drinks may drink his death. Provide Our army first, and let each man among us Have order to abstain from brook or fountain. Match us in force they may—but not in guile. Our courage, backed with cunning, cannot fail. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. —INTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE, as before. Videna discovered seated at the altar. King Gorbudoc and Marcella in front of the stage. Marcella. Was ever maid so wretched? Forth hath gone My sire against my lover, him to slay. War terrible, when nation against nation Meet in fierce strife upon the neutral field— But, when 'tis house 'gainst house, or, worse than so, The family within 'gainst one another, Parent 'gainst child, and brethren against brethren— Not only terrible art thou, O war, But odious, without honour, without heroism, Nothing but blood and tears, and broken hearts. King. Life has for thee a long and hopeful way For happy travel yet. For thee remain Yet many flowery paths and pleasant views— And well for thee that still, within the springs Of those fair eyes, abides a fount of tears— Would that Videna's matron orbs might pour Such plenteous shower, or shed one slender drop; Then might the silent stubborn misery, That eats her up, solution hope to find. Videna (rising). 'Tis done. Sweet pity's angel for thy griefs, Marcella, felt what I might not for mine. Thy tender plainings made me pity thee, For there was that in them was pitiable. Thy griefs had not outgrown all sympathy; And, while thy tears were flowing, mine began, And once again this heart is almost human. King. Videna, then again thou knowest me? Thou art not now a fearful mockery Of age and sorrow and infirmity, But hast to me returned a gracious Queen. Videna. Returned indeed. For on a distant journey I verily have been—and, in my trance, My heart was hardened to a rock—and is. Yet am I bent to meet the worst can chance— And that the worst will happen well I know. But I am armed—am rigid—every nerve And fibre of my body is upstrung, Like a set harp, for the dread solemn music That fate means it to utter. I but bide The period that is doomed—nor shall wait long. Enter Philander. King. Well, speak thy business, boy. Philander. A horseman comes Flying this way with such unearthly speed, I could not choose but tell thee. King. Forth again, And watch his course. [Exit Philander. Videna. His course is hither. Yes, The end hastes on. King. But it may not be evil— Videna. It must be. King. 'Tis the kindness of the gods To me, that they do make thee thus despair; Whence, seeking to compose thy mightier woe, I minister that comfort to us both I had scorned else myself. Re-enter Philander. Philander. The horseman is Prince Porreo: he has dashed him from his steed, And now is entering. [Exit Philander. King. Calmly now, Videna. Videna. Fear me not, King—I am calm—I am stone—and thou? King. A wave that waits the wind. Enter Porreo. King. What dost thou here? To make submission, as a conquered man, That thou hast left alone the field of battle? Porreo. I am a conquered man—who has lost all. King. Thou mightst have lost it to a sterner foe, Who would make no return—but, if repentant, Thou'rt still our son. Thy brother, then, is victor? Porreo. He too is vanquished— King. Speak not riddles, boy. There was no third for victor o'er ye twain. [Porreo remains silent. Videna. I know it, ere thou tellest me—yet speak. Porreo. Ferrex lives not. Videna. And it was thou who slewest him? Porreo. Alas! Videna. In open fight, or by a secret stroke? Porreo. In open fight, and not by secret stroke. Videna. On the fair plain? Porreo. My mother, even so. Marcella (to Videna). And is it in thy heart to question thus; When Ferrex lies upon the bloody field, Slain by his brother? Porreo. Thou, Marcella, thou? Marcella (to Porreo). Hence, for I find thou hast led my heart astray, Which now I read aright—which should have loved him, For virtues such as I ne'er saw in thee— Misled by thy fair outside, how untrue. How comely was the frankness of thy brow, How princely was thy cheerful countenance, How manly was thy breast, thy arms how lithe, Thy limbs how graceful in their symmetry. When thou wert mounted on thy generous steed, For chase or tilt, with favours in thy helm, At leisure or in tourney, never man Was better formed to charm a lady's eye, Was worthier seen to win a lady's heart. But HE did wear the beauty in his soul, The fitness we admired was in his mind, And grandeur by his spirit was upheld. There, where he lies on the red field of death, Will I find out his corse, and, gazing on it, Proclaim unto his spirit, hovering near, What love I felt for him—but now first known. [Exit Marcella. Porreo. Now am I lost, indeed. Abandoned thus, To whom for safety shall I now repair? King (coming solemnly forward). To me.—Look in my face—thou canst not?—Ah!— Well—well. I will be calm as is thy mother. She sets me good example—I will learn it— Gods, gods! I'm patient. Tell thy tale right out, That I may know what exculpation—what Atonement has been—or is needed—speak. Porreo. Father, with wounded soul, I will obey. The armies met—I saw him at the head Of valiant numbers; wrath, and pride, and hate, And jealousy, ay, and a thousand passions, Which now his blood has quenched, perplexed my brain— I sought him—he avoided me—but still Him I pursued from point to point, till, seeing Our party got advantage by the turns He was compelled to take, to avoid my hunt, He stood at bay. He fought, and with a valour That showed he shunned me not from cowardice; And I confess, with evident regard, Forbore to smite me, when 'twas in his power. But hell urged on my arm, and I smote him, Even to the death. Then victory seemed mine— But, at the moment, from the southern side, Dunwarro, leading on slain Inmer's troops, A troop of ghosts—(for so they seemed to me In my confusion)—rushed from midst the lines Of my own ranks, and, putting all to rout, With tresses wildly rent, unhelmed and shieldless, Scarce left me leisure to escape. King. And better Had it been for thee thou hadst ne'er escaped. Come, bare thy breast, and let my sword dig deep Thy false heart from thy bosom. Videna. Seize upon The altar's horns, O Porreo, and be safe. [He does so. For thee, O Gorbudoc, of Brutus' line, Thou monarch of the ancestry of Troy, This vengeance fits not thee. No, nor thine age, Nor famous memory, shall be stained with blood. King. 'Twere divine justice should I kill him now. —Thy temple, and thy shrine, Apollo, guard him? Restrain me not, aught holy, aught divine, Lest I grow mad. Ye gods, are ye not fathers? [Pacing round the stage in agony. Porreo (having taken refuge at the altar, kneeling). What can I make of this? Surprise confounds me. My mother, like the statue of a god, Stands, in indifferent majesty serene, As if the dead were nothing, having left One of her children living; while my sire, In vehement transport, circles round the fane, With infinite swiftness, like a thunder cloud Driven by a whirlwind o'er a wilderness. Gods! terrible for him who slays his brother To meet again his parents, terrible. King (suddenly stopping). Then be it so. But what it is forbid A father's sword to do, is not forbid A father's curse. Hear me, thou sun, whose beams Were not turned back when this misdeed was done. Hear me, and consecrate my words for things; Here in thy temple. Let him not go forth, Unstamped with malediction. Let my curse Be on him like a seal. Let it be in His flesh like to a shaft shot from thy bow, Apollo, and be mortal, as was that Which slew the Python. Is he not a snake, Who stung and slew his brother? Porreo. Sire and King, Withdraw these obtestations from the ear Of him who rules this shrine. A father's curse Is more than I can bear. King. What punishment, That man can bear, befits the fratricide? Stay with thy mother, if she can endure The company of such a wretch as thou. Myself will forth, and, like Marcella, seek My slaughtered son upon the battle-field, For whom I would have died. Thee contemplate I will not—cannot—living. But like him To look on thee a corse were happiness. [Exit. Porreo. I have no refuge but in thee, my mother. Videna. None, O my son! Porreo. Thy son? Videna. Yes—still, my son; Albeit thy father cursed thee. Porreo. Thou wilt curse Me not? Videna. No—for I waste not words. Porreo. Strange—brief— And icy is thy speech. Videna. Wouldst have me praise, (Because I will not blame,) in flowery phrase, The deed which has deprived me of a son, Whom once I loved as well as thee? And sure, That love for thee was strong, which such a deed Has not extinguished. From yon altar now Thou mayst divorce thy hands. Come in with me To yonder chamber, our sometime retreat, While civil war was raging, to the which Thou thus hast put an end. There will we talk, In private, of this solemn business. Porreo. I thank thee, mother;—and 'twill stead me well— For I am over-weary. Videna. Canst thou sleep? Porreo. What meanest thou? Videna. Nothing. Porreo. 'Twas my phantasy That made the tone thou spakest in startle me. Truly, events like these will try us sore, Howe'er we brave them out, and make us live Even in the unconscious hairs that point our flesh. I am grown sensitive; and, but that nature Has been o'ertasked, should fear to slumber more. Videna. In—in—(aside) Thy brother sleeps—why shouldst not thou? [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —FIELD AFTER THE BATTLE BY MOONLIGHT. Panorama of hill and forest, with groups of dead and dying. Enter Marcella. Marcella. Shadow, that fleetest over heath and hill, That midst the dead and dying guidest me, When wilt thou pause, and point the noble frame In which the spirit once was liberal Of all that wooes and wins? O, Ferrex, stay. Shew me thy corse, that I may clasp it thus; And on thy cold, cold lips bestow the kiss They never felt while living. Stay, O stay! Illusion! 'tis a moonbeam cheats my vision; Mantled in mist—and now it fades—it fades. No spirit hovers to direct my search, But through the horrors of this silenced plain I wander, fear-distraught. Enter Philander. Philander. Lady Marcella. Marcella. O, I am called; I come, dear shade, I come. Rebuke me not, if I do seem afraid— Pardon my shrieks—forgive me if I groan. I have heard shrieks and groans along the field, And they have taught my soul to echo them; And I have wildly screamed, and tossed my arms, In frantic terror, to the scornful moon, That me before ne'er mocked. All things are changed— The living is the dead—the dead is living; My lover lives, but still the heart I prize Hath ceased to beat. Mine throbs to agony. Philander. I am no spirit, lady, but Philander— He you were wont to call your pretty page; I am here to guide you from these slaughtered heaps. Myself and Dordan came to seek thee, lady, And good King Gorbudoc. Him he hath found, Searching, like thee, for Ferrex' corse in vain; And now, thanks to the moonlight that still shines, Though battle hath shed blood and broken hearts On the hushed earth, my quest has prospered here. Go with me, lady. Marcella. Go with thee—and whither? What canst thou do for me, or I for thee? Canst thou distinguish where the slain one sleeps? Philander. It must be hereabouts. Marcella. What sayest thou? How knowest? Philander. Dordan and I were on the field, Anxious to watch the progress of the fight, And learn its issue. We did see him fall— Marcella. Is this the spot? Ah, let us here remain— Examine here, until, from out the mass, We can discern the honoured and the loved. Philander. Ha! 'tis—it is the spot—and here he lies. Marcella. Where?—where? That is not princely Ferrex. Philander. No, sweet lady, 'Tis Hermon. Marcella. As his friend, let him be dear— Philander. He bravely battled by his prince's side; Opposed by furious Enyon, till he fell, Slain by his foeman with a sudden thrust; Which seeing, princely Ferrex turned apart, To avenge him on his victor mainly bent, When Porreo his unguarded brother smote. What happened next I know not; instant rout Succeeding that mischance. Marcella. What happened next? What values it what happened? Even the wreck Of the great earth had been an accident Of little note; for all the good it had, Then perished. Nothing beautiful or fair Was there, in all it compassed, to affect— And all the hearts in it were void of love. Sorrow, remorse, and madness, and revenge Engross all bosoms with one soul of hate— I know 'tis so—it cannot but be so. Philander. Nay, lady, yield not to such sad despair— Along with me—why not along with me? Marcella. We have not found him—Hermon is not he. Philander. It cannot be, but he is borne away— Marcella. Hush, hush, thou knowst not what thou pratest of. Philander. Here comes another. 'Tis Apollo's priest. Enter the Priest. Priest. Here has, I see, my errand glad result. Marcella. Thou art a priest and canst inquire of gods, And they respond in oracles. Now—now— Give hasty satisfaction my demand— Tell me where Ferrex lies? Priest. Even now, I passed Where, on a bier, the brave Dunwarro guards The body of the Prince. The Queen herself, Who holds her grief with wondrous fortitude, Dispatched me from the temple, where she bides, In search of thee; and, hither as I came, I crossed the sad procession on my way. Marcella. O give me wings! float me upon the wind— That, without lapse and motion of my own, I may be there—for he hath waited long. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —ANOTHER PART OF THE FIELD. Enter the King, with Dordan dressed as a mendicant. King. Thanks for thy service—though I know thee not— Yet sometimes when my twilight mind took note Of outward things, thy voice hath tones in it With which I seemed familiar. What art thou? Dordan. A beggar, my good master. King. Why not work? How camest thou to beg? Dordan. I was—a fool— That is—in this world's ways. I could not learn To care for things that other men much prize. Their wealth, their state, were ostentatious gauds, The which I thought it wisdom to contemn— My wit, my parts, were personal accidents, The which they thought it folly to esteem. And so I made a world unto myself Of thoughts and fancies, which, whene'er I uttered, The world at large mistook for idiocies. King. So, so. The vain ones. And their drivelling cares, To multiply their stores, and keep their power, And their poor plans to purchase early ease, They thought were pieces of consummate prudence. 'Tis criminal folly—they were the true idiots; So they would know, had they but my experience. Thus thou becamest a beggar? Dordan. Ay, good master. King. Well, well, 'tis all the same, whatever course Of life we take. I am a beggar, too, And yet I wrought by the opposite rule. There's nothing For man to do, but trust the gods, and they The issues shape as pleases their great wisdoms. Dordan. It is most true. King. I could not find my son. He lay not on the field (my son! my son!); But I found thee, where I, from weariness, Had sunk. Sure, I had lain instead of him, But that a beggar raised me from the soil, Moist—moist—with blood; ye gods, with human blood. Dordan. They have borne thy son away. King. Who? who? good fellow. Dordan. Dunwarro and his soldiers— King. Why, thou fool, Thou toldst me so before. Dordan. Fool? So I am. King. I beg thy pardon, thou art but a beggar; I ought to give thee value for thy service, Having been once a King. But now I have nothing. I called thee fool. These brows, though they look grave, Have not with wisdom overmuch been burthened. What's here? A crown?—of gold? It is not mine; 'Tis his—and he is dead—slain by his brother. Fool; wouldst thou think it? I have nothing but This gaud in all the world! He wants it not; And there's another shall not have it; so Take it, good fellow, for thy pains, and be No more a beggar. Melt it down. Dordan (aside). This is A sorry jest. Alas, my poor old King Knows Dordan but by glimpses. (to King) But, master, My honesty will not permit my taking So rich a prize. King. Thy honesty? part with it. Ferrex was honest; nay, was generous, And therefore he was killed. Wouldst thou escape Worse even than beggary, part with honesty. Dordan. With safety, too, sometimes. They'd say I stole This crown. King. Fool; 'tis not worth the stealing. Who Hath that, has fear, and pain, and agony; It weighs so heavy on the skull, the brain Is crushed, and then confusion comes, and madness, And he who wears it knows not what he doth. I will not take it back. Thou hast it—there— Good luck go with it; I am rid of it. Put'st it not on? Dordan. I am already capped. A helmet would have better served our need, Since I am thirsty to a thought, to catch Some water when we find it. King. Come—come—come Into the city. There is many a fountain— Troth, but my own tongue's parched; though I forgot it, Talking with thee. Ye gods! my sons—my sons! [Exeunt. SCENE THE LAST. —EXTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO. Steps leading up to the gates. Enter Enyon and a crowd of people. Enyon. I tell you we have conquered. The King is good as dead. He has been drinking of the fountains which are all poisoned, and has not an hour to live. Some who have partaken of them are even dead already. Ferrex is dead—and Porreo therefore must reign. The prince is here, with his haughty mother, in this temple, the gates whereof are locked—but must be opened. Knock loud— [The people ascend the steps, knock at the gates, and shout vociferously, “Porreo, Porreo, King Porreo!”] —louder— and call on Porreo, Porreo, King Porreo! No answer? O there's jugglery. We'll find a means. But see. There comes Dunwarro, with his procession and the corse of Ferrex. His followers are well armed. We are not. Let us to the town, and supply our hands with what they need. [Exeunt clamorously. Trumpets. Enter Dunwarro, Marcella, with three or four Soldiers (one bearing the crown of gold). Dunwarro. No further seek, my daughter: thou hast found The living; nor is distant far the dead. Stretched on a bier, sustained in the embrace Of faithful men who've for their country fought, Slain Ferrex' corse approaches. [Solemn music.—Enter Soldiers carrying the body of Ferrex on a bier, which they set down.] Marcella. Beautiful, And lovely, art thou, even in thy death. For sake of thee, and of thy noble goodness, Wronged shade! most solemnly I make my vow— The unnatural hand that slew thee ne'er in mine Shall pressure feel—the pleadings of his lips My heart shall never hear. I banish him From the deep memories of my haunted soul, Which thou henceforth shalt fill to plenitude, Its prince, its hero, and its only king! Dunwarro. A virtuous resolution, O my daughter! And still to heal what civil war has vexed, And grace the memory of restorèd peace, To Concord straight a temple I'll erect; And since, because of what has chanced, a maid, Marcella, thou art pledged to live and die, Thereof thou shalt the vestal priestess be. [Exit Marcella. And now, brave mourners for the valiant dead, Resume the honoured corse; and let the dirge Throw once again its moanings on the wind, While to the shrine ye bear your sacred charge. [Music. Set wide the temple gates without delay. Knock loud! knock loud! Within there! who's within? What ho! what ho! None answers? Soft; there comes The honest priest. Enter the Priest. Grant us, good priest, admittance. Priest. I have sought it for myself, this hour or more, In vain. The Queen Videna, with Prince Porreo, Is there alone. Why they keep shut the gates, I cannot guess. Dunwarro. O! did she know the need We have for instant entrance, she would match The speed wherewith the wedded eagle flies To soothe her dying mate. Priest. King Gorbudoc? Dunwarro. Ay, honest priest—even he. Couldst thou but see him, Where under escort he approaches hither. I sped but on before to make all ready. Priest. What shape assumes the crime or accident? Dunwarro. 'Tis both. Not long ago (having obtained Success in an apt stratagem, whereby Victory set foot upon Rebellion's crest, And spurned the brains out), joyously returning From our long labours in the well-fought field, We passed the fountain at the city gates. There, sitting, Gorbudoc himself we saw, And on his knees a seeming mendicant, Who, closely scanned, presented to our wonder Dordan, the sometime fool; but he was dead, Having within his grasp this crown of gold Strictly secured, for to his charge the king The precious gift had in some way confided. It was not in me not to pity him; For lately I found in him a kind of merit, The which before his office kept concealed. He had drunken of that fountain, and was poisoned. So likewise had the king, who, from the field Where lay his eldest son had been led thither, Frantic almost in mind. 'Twould seem as if Their feverish grief had kindled in them both The appetite of thirst. Dordan is dead, And Gorbudoc is dying. No more words— They're bringing him this way. Knock at the gates,— Make riotous onset; break through bolts and bars; Bring levers here. Enter the King, supported by Eubulus and attendants, with Marcella. King. Where bear ye me? Eubulus. To the temple. King. Ha! there I have a son yet. Remains the Queen? Dunwarro. Both, saith this priest, are there; but locked within. King. O, what? Ah, sure, I have drunk a draught from Orcus, It is so hot within me. Locked the gates! Why this? Why this? My wits I think were wandering; But the medicine of the poisoned spring hath called The truants back. Alas, evil is now So common I can dream of nothing else. Psha—there can be no harm. Dunwarro. Knock at the gates, I say.—What ho. (They knock.) King. Who poisoned all the wells? Dunwarro. Heed not of that, thou dying majesty. Look, how he suffers, yet how patiently. King (to Marcella). Come, my good girl. Ai—ai—let me not groan— Let me not groan. No—no—nor sigh, nor weep. Not weep? A cooling tear might soothe this fire. Let it rage—let it rage; for could I quench it, grief Were wild for thee, my Queen, and our young Princes. Dunwarro. Stand by, and give him air. King. Air? air? Not all The winds could fan me into ease again. I would bespeak Marcella. Dunwarro. Go to him. [Marcella goes. King (to Marcella). My daughter! Such thou hadst been, if thy virtues Had not made thee too well beloved—my daughter! I die—I leave no heir to Britain's throne; None—ne'er that fratricide shall sit upon it— I looked to have seen thee Queen of one fair half. Half—that division has divided all; Brother from brother, parent from the child, And lovers from each other; even the betrothed Soul from the body. How mine struggles here. She burns for freedom from the flesh she loathes. My life pants forth; I'll bite my lip and keep The fiery breath yet in. Well, that pain's conquered. Marcella, take yon crown. Did not the god Inspire thee with foreknowledge of this woe? And promise peace when that should rule alone? The iron crown is broken, and my line— The line of Brutus—is without a claimant. Thy father hath made peace. Let him succeed me. Crown him. Dunwarro shall be King. It is My dying will. Crown him, I say, while yet My eyes can see, for they grow very dim. Dunwarro. Knock at the gates again. O royal wife; O princely son; is there not instinct in ye To know who waits without, and in what need? Videna! Porreo! Gorbudoc demands you— Come forth, and aid him in the hour of death. [The gates open, Videna appears between them at the threshold, where she stands immovable in an erect attitude.] Videna. Whose clamour here disturbs the peace of gods? Dunwarro. The King requires admission. Videna. Ha, old man. Approach me not, for I am consecrate; Not human, but divine; the immaculate Goddess of justice. Dunwarro. What is this? Dread lady, King Gorbudoc is at the point of death. Videna. The better— King. O these pangs; yet I must question The solemn mystery she hath late become— Videna! Videna. Thou beholdst the corse of Ferrex. King. Sad mother, ay, and soon shall see his soul. Videna. Wouldst also look on the slain corse of Porreo? King. How died he? Videna (descending the steps). King, I say not he is dead; I but demand if thou wouldst see him so, As once thou saidst to see him so were good. King. I would not see him living; and, anon, These eyes will nothing see that's of this world— Say, is he dead? Videna. Not dead—he sleeps. King. Sleeps? Videna. Ay (coming forward), He sleeps. He sleeps? How can he sleep? His arm Is wearied with long conflict, and his mind With labour worn, sleeps—though the work was mortal. King. Now should I grieve, but that, without design, Into my heart, which is a prisoner here, Within a wall of flesh, a friend has come, Who is battering down for me the dungeon barriers, A faithful friend, yet sharp in his reproofs. Videna. Sleep! makest no difference 'twixt the innocent And guilty? Art thou a god indifferent To crime or folly? Frequent I've been told That conscience lived in dreams, and waked in sleep: He hath a brother's blood upon his soul, And yet he sleeps. King. Videna—O this fire. Videna. My mother's heart. O pardon, Gorbudoc, The wife's neglect. O King, why art thou thus? King. Videna, I am dying. Videna (coming closer to him). Dying? King. Ay— Pain, pain—'tis over. 'Twas in mercy given; This corporal anguish calms the wounded soul, That else were ravished into agony. The gods have rightly judged. Videna (coming still closer). Hast taken poison? King. By chance, not by design. The springs were poisoned. Videna. Ha! and by whom? He told me, ere he fell Asleep, the manner of the war, and, chief, This stratagem. He sleeps; but I sleep not. I wander wakeful. Wherefore should he sleep? Ha! why should he awake? Oracular Slumber! thou image of stern death! 'Tis clear; The mystery is made clear—I see it well. [Ascends the steps and looks into the temple. There is a rush of thoughts, like that of waves, Filling the mind, as they the sea, with a voice Of power in motion, irresistible. [Looking again into the temple, and going a little way into it.] Dunwarro (to the King). Let's help thee to the temple. King. To the dead? No, I can die even here. 'Twill soon be passed; Then I may look on him, unwounded by The hand that bare him, in Elysium, By that dread act of justice expiate. Dunwarro. What dream is this? King. The thought is in her heart! Videna (returning). No; he should never wake again (descends the steps). He smiles In his sleep, as if he were a child; my child— My only child. My only child! And why My only—only child? A mother's heart pours gall Upon the murderer of her son—of thee, His father, too (coming close to the King)— King. 'Twas chance—he knew it not— (My sons! my sons!) Or thou, or I am dying— Thou lookst so pale: I touch thee, thou art cold— Thou diest as thou standest—it is strange, Looking how proud, even in death—severe, But ever just. How are the royal fallen. There; now I feel less pain—less pain—and now, None—none. Farewell! (dies.) Videna (who has been absorbed in contemplating the King, now ròuses as from a trance). Farewell? farewell. Alas! That pallor and that coldness were thine own. Thou art dead—I live alone. The avenger lives Both of a son's and royal lord's foredoing. “Chance,” was it? There's no chance in anything; But good and evil both are of design, Or man's or gods', and must be answered for. Wonder, he sleeps so long. Sore-wearied, he is lying In yon far chamber. Chamber—where is it? Apollo, in thy temple. Should a fane— A sacred, holy fane—be desecrate With murder? Who said murder? 'Twas not I— Nor thou, Apollo. No; nor ye, ye Furies. Whom mildly we bespeak, and not in fear— At least not I—for I do love ye now— I love ye, O ye Furies. Beautiful, And calm, and most affectionate are ye; For ye take pity on my double wrongs. [Tumult without; Enyon and a great crowd armed rush in, shouting “King Porreo; King Porreo!”] Are ye the Furies? timely have ye come. But hush, else he will wake—King Porreo sleeps! Enyon. We'll have him for our King. None else but he! Videna. You'll have him for your King? No Furies ye— Our sometime subjects. Am I not your Queen? Whom would you have for King? Enyon. Whom else but Porreo? Videna. Whom else but Porreo? None else but he! Behold you, here, his sire; and, here, his brother, Sleeping in death—death by his deed procured, Or acted—and he there, but dead in sleep. Enyon. Dead? Friends— Videna. Your patience, prithee! I but said, In sleep, even as these two sleep in death. I marvel at ye, ye can plead for him, The brother-slayer and the father-slayer. A people destined for dominion, (For I in this great hour can prophesy), Methinks, should rather crush such criminal, Than crown him! I, his mother, loving him, There mused how I might do the deed? What means? What instruments? These hands were all too weak, And from the pillows of his couch I shrank; For they would need more strength than woman hath, To crush a man, who is a reptile, yet Strong as a serpent or a dragonet,— Born of a dragon-mother! Enyon. Horrid thought! And yet thou smilest at it? Videna. Yes, I smile. I am his mother. What he did I can do. Enyon. Break way into the temple—find King Porreo. Videna. Dunwarro wears the crown, not Porreo; And guards the temple, as ye see, with soldiers. Enyon. Treason to Porreo! Citizens and friends, We are the greater number—they must yield. Besides, the city is in arms, to help us; And, lo, they come by hundreds to our aid. [He looks out—approaching huzzahs are heard. Videna. Is it so? He sleeps soundly on his couch, Or this would wake him. So, ye are bent upon it? Well, ye shall have the monster for your King, Who is not fit to live the meanest slave. I'll bring him forth. But first I would dispose These unregarded bodies (that, methinks, Your plaudits would profane the presence of) Within these hallowed chambers. Gentle priest, I pray your office. We will order this— To Dunwarro)Stay thou, and reason with these rebel men. [The corses of Ferrex and the King are borne into the temple, led by Videna and Marcella, and followed by Priest.] Dunwarro. Trust in the Queen—she will bring forth her son; Nor doubt, I wear this crown against your wills, Though set upon my brows by Gorbudoc;— But, as to Porreo, let your own hearts speak. [Enter others, crying “King Porreo! King Porreo! Porreo shall be King.”] It shall be so, then [As he is about to uncrown himself, a loud shriek is heard from the temple.] What is that? (shrieks repeated). Again! Terror and pity, and all passions else, Blend in those dismal cries. Re-enter Priest, distractedly. Priest. O hour of fate. Enyon. What fate? Priest. Here comes the doer of the deed, The sternest yet was done. O mother earth!— Ne'er to my dying hour shall I forget What I have witnessed in yon temple's chamber. Stretched on his couch, the princely Porreo lay, As now he slumbers there—but not, as now, A wound, wide as the gates of life and death, Midst of his manly chest:—and, him beside, Conscious of blood, the fatal weapon glowed, Even his own battle sword, whose ruthless edge Soon rent that hideous chasm. Re-enter Videna, followed by Marcella, who, however, stops at the threshold of the temple, and upon the loftiest step, where she sinks down, burying her face in her hands, and remains in that fixed attitude till the fall of the curtain. Videna. Bring forth King Porreo— Shew the rude people whom they'd have for king. Priest. No, no; keep it within. 'Tis fit that now Ye disobey her. See, she stands enrapt; She notes us not while she is thus abstract. Videna. Lay it on the earth—here, lay it at our feet. Priest. She dreams she is obeyed, and that the corse Of Porreo is brought forth and laid before her. Enyon. Treason—most bloody treason. Swift revenge. [Clashing of swords, conflict. Videna (disclosing the sword which she had previously concealed under her robes). Look ye, I have his sword. Could this not sting? Couldst thou not, sword? There is some blood upon thee, Which, having voice, saith, “Ask his brother's heart?” Should it not sting his own? Should it not, Heaven? [Thunder heard. Thunder? I'm answered. (Kneels) Heaven, thy will be done. The Oracle long said fulfils itself! I kiss the blood upon thee. Enyon. Whose is it? Videna. 'Tis Porreo's. Enyon. Porreo's. Videna (rising). Ay, your King's—my Son's. 'Tis his and Ferrex' blood, here blended now. Enyon. How came to deed this horror? Videna. By this hand. Some one remove that felon from my sight. Enyon. Come with me, friends; elsewhere we'll seek redress. [Enyon exit, others prepare to follow him. Videna. Stay! Ye left no choice to me. He reign? he reign? O'er a great people, virtuous, free, and brave? He, fratricide and parricide at once! Was't not immortal justice thus to wreak The vengeance of a broken heart on him? 'Twas worthy of that altar, of that place; That holy ground of all the general earth Was fittest spot for such most righteous deed. None other were so suited—it was sacred— A deed so pure as consecrates anew The temple where 'twas done, and should be done Only in a temple, or make a temple there Where it was done. Divinity of justice, I feel thee—I confess thee—I am thine. —Faint—give me strength; faint—faint—my brain is swimming— My soul's escaping! Whither would it fly? O the world fades.—Make room!—my heart would burst. [She swoons. Dunwarro (leaning over her). Whence hadst thou heart this duty to perform? Videna. There! there! 'Twas smitten, and I maddened—now 'Tis broken, and I die (falls as if dead, then rallies). Reign thou the King. [Dies. THE END.</field>
