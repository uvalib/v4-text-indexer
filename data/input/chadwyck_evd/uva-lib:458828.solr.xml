Bawds, Panders, to a young Whore; Enter Bilbo. Bilb. Theeues, Theeues, Theeues, where are they Master? Mal. Where are they Bilbo? What Theefe seest thou? Bil. That il fauor'd Theefe in your Candle sir, none else not I. Mal. Why didst thou cry Theeues then? Bilb. Because you cry'd Whores; I knew a Theefe was alwayes within a stones cast of a Whore. Mal. What mak'st thou vp at Midnight? Bilb. I make them which are made euery houre i'th day (patches.) Mal. Slaue what art doing? Bil. That which few men can doe, mending Sir. Mal. What art mending? Bil. That which few men care to mend, a bad sole. Mal. Looke here, come hither, dost thou see what's this? Bil. I see tis our Wicket master. Mal. Stop there and tell me, is Tormiella forth? Bil. I heard Puskeena our Kitchin-maid say, she was going about a murther: Mal. A murther; of whom? Bil. Of certaine Skippers; she was fleaing her selfe. Mal. She dwels not in her Chamber, for my Ghost (Call'd from his rest) from Roome to roome has stalk'd, Yet met no Tormelia. Was not her sweet heart here to night, Gazetto? Bil. Gazetto! no sir, here was no Gazetto here. Mal. Walke round the Orchard, holla for her there. Bil. So, ho ho, ho, ho. Exit. Mal. She's certaine with Gazetto, Should he turne Villaine, traine my poore child forth Though she's contracted to him, and rob her youth Of that Gemme none can prize (because nere seene) The Virgins riches (Chastity) and then (When he has left her vgly to all eyes) His owne should loath her, vds death I would draw An old mans nerues all vp into this arme. And nayle him to the Bedâ Enter Bilbo. Bil. So, ho, ho, ho, the Conyes vse to feed most i'th night Sir, yet I cannot see my young mistris in our Warren. Mal. No! Bil.

What Bilbo out with all. Bil. A Barber stood with her on Saturday night very late, when he had shau'd all his Customers, and as I thinke, came to trimme her. Mal. A Barber! To trim her! Sawst thou the Muskeod? Bil. A chequer'd aprone Gentleman I assure you: he smelt horrible strong of Camphire, Bay leaues and Rose water: and he stood fidling with Tormiella. Mal. Ha? Bil. Fidling at least halfe an houre, on a Citterne with a mans broken head at it, so that I thinke 'twas a Barber Surgion: and there's one Cynamomo a Shopkeeper, comes hither a batfowling euery Moone-shine night too. Mal. What's he! Cynamomo! Bil. I take him to be a Comfitmaker with rotten teeth, for he neuer comes till the Barber's gone. Mal. A Comfitmaker! Bii. Yes Sir, for he gaue Tormiella a Candied roote once, and she swore 'twas the sweetest thingâ Mal. Dwels he hero i'th City? Bil. He has a house i'th City, but I know not where he liues. Mal. Sheele follow her kind; turne Monster, get a light. Bil. My sconce is ready Sir. Mal. Call at Gazettoes Lodging, aske how he dares Make a Harlot of my child,âslaue say no more: Begon, beat boldly. Bil. Ile beat downe the doore; and put him in mind of a Shroue-tuesday, the fatall day for doores to be broken open. Exit. Mal. For this night I'm her Porter; Oh haplesse Creatures! There is in woman a Diuell from her birth, Of bad ones we haue sholes, of good a dearth. Exit. Enter Cordolente and Tormiella. Cor. No more my Tormiella, night hath borne Thy vowes to heauen, where they are fyl'd by this Eyther one day to crowne thy constant Soule Or (if thou spot it with foule periury,) For euer to condemne thee. Ter. Come it shall not: Here am I sphear'd for euer, thy feares (deare Loue) Strike coldly on thy jealous breast I know From that my Fathers promise to Gazetto That he should haue me, contract is there none, For my heart loath'd it, is there left an oath Fit for a Maid to sweare by. Cord. Good sweet giue o're, What need we binding oathes being fast before? I dare the crabbed'st Fate, shee cannot spin A thred thus fine and rotten; how now! sad! Tor. Pray Heauen, I bee not mist at home, deare Cordolente Thou shalt no farther, Ile venter now my selfe. Cor. How sweet! venture alone! Torm. Yes, yes, good rest. Cor. By that are Louers parted, seldome blest. Enter Bilbo. Bil. Who goes there, if you be a woman stand, for all the men I met to night, lye in the Kennell. Tor. My Fathers man! I am betray'd. Cor. Feare nothing. Tor. Bilbo! Whether art thou running? Bil. Out of my wits and yet no Churles Executor, 'tis no money makes me mad, but want of money. Tor. Good tell me whether art going? Bil. I am going to Hell (that's to say home) for my Master playes the Diuell, and I come from seeking out a house of euerlasting Thunder, (that's to say a Woman) I haue beene bouncing at Signior Gazetto's Chamber for you. Tor. Ha! Bil. You'l be haa'd when you come home. Tor. I am vndone for euer. Cor. Thou art not, peace. Bil. Signior Gazetto is horne-mad, and leapt out of his Bed, (as if fleas had bit him) so that I thinke he comes running starke naked after me. Tor. Oh me, what helpe my dearest Soule? Cor. To desperate wounds Let's apply desperate cure, dar'st thou flye hence? Tor. Dare! try me. Cor. Then farewell Cordoua; Horses wee'l forthwith hire, and quicke to Siuell My birth-place, there thou shalt defie all stormes. Tor. Talke not, but doe. Bil. She would haue you doe much but say little. Tor. Bilbo, thou seest me not. Bil. No, no, away, mum I. Cor. To shut thy lips fast, here are lockes of Gold. Bil. I'spy a light comming, trudge this way. Tor. You dally with fire, haste, haste, Bilbo farewell. Cor. O starre-crost Loue! To find way to whose Heauen, man wades through Hell. Exeunt manet Bilbo. Enter Gazetto. Gaz. Wo, ho, ho, ho,âwhew. Bil. Another Fire-drake! More Salamanders! Heere Sir. Gaz. Bilbo! How now! Is the Dy-dapper aboue water yet? Bil. Signior Gazetto! Mine Eyes are no bigger then litle pinnes heads with staring, my heeles ake with trotting, my candle is come to an vntimely end through a Consumption. yet my yong Mistris your sweet hart, like sweet breath amongst Tobacco-drinkers, is not to be found. Gaz. On, take my Torch, apace: the neer'st way home. Fluttering abroad by Owle-light! Bil. Here sir, turne downe this Lane; shall I knocke your Torch Signior? Gaz. Prithee doe what thou wilt, the Diuell! where is she? Bil. Had you knockt your Torch well before Tormiella (ware the post) and held it well vp when it was lighted, she had neuer giuen you the slip, and i'faith Signior when is the day? Gaz. The wedding (meanst thou) on Saint Lukes day next, 'Tis mine owne name thou know'st: but now I feare She's lost, and the day too. Bil. If she should driue you by foule weather into Cuckolds Hauen before Saint Lukes day comes, Signior Luco how then? Gaz. If she dares let her, I haue her Fathers promise, nay oath that I shall haue her. Bil. Here is my Masters Gate. Gaz. Stay she's at home sure now: Ile slip aside, Knocke thou, and if she answeres (as 'tis likely) Weel try if still th'old fencing be in vse, That faulty women neuer want excuse. Bil. They are made for the purpose to lye and cullor, Ile knocke. Mal. Who's there? Bil. 'Tis I, open the doore. Mal. What! to a Common! Bil. What common! You doe me wrong sir, though I goe in breeches, I am not the roaring girle you take me for. Mal. Wert thou with Gazetto? Bil. Yes. Mal. Was she with Gazetto? Bil. No. Mal. Was Gazetto alone? Bil. No sir, I was with him. Mal. Foole knew not he she was forth? Bil. Yes when I told him. Gaz. Signior Malevento open the doore pray. Mal. Oh Luke Gazetto. Gaz. Not yet come home! Mal. No, no. Gaz. Not yet! vds death When I shall take the Villaine does this wrong, Had better stolne away a Starre from Heauen No Spaniard sure dares doe it. Bil. 'Tis some English man has stolne her, I hold my life, for most Theeues and brauest Cony-catchers are amongst them. Gaz. All Cordoua search ere morning, if not found Ile ride to Siuill, Ile mount my Iennet Sir And take the way to Madrill. Mal. Ne're speake of Madrill, The iourney is for her too dangerous, If Cordoua hold her not, lets all to Siuill. Haste, haste, by breake of day Signior Gazetto let vs meet agen. Gaz. Agreed: Mal. We'll hunt her out. Exit. Bil. But you know not when, will you take your Torch. Exit. Gaz. Keepe it, lustfull maiden! Hot Spanish vengeance followes thee, which flyes Like three forkt Lightning, whom it smites, he dyes. Exit. Enter Prince Iohn all vnready, and Pacheco his Page. Iohn. Pacheco? Pach. My Lord. Ioh. Is't so earely! What a Clocke Is't? Pach. About the houre that Souldiers goe to bed, and Catchpoles rise: Will your Lordship be truss'd vp this morning? Ioh. How dost meane, goe to hanging! Pach. Hanging! does your Lordship take me for a crack-rope, Ioh. No, but for a notable Gallowes, too many Lordships are truss'd vp euery day (boy) some wud giue a 1000. Crownes to haue 'em vnty'd, but come sir tye vp my Lordship. Pach. As fast as I can, Oh my Lord and a man could tye friends to him as fast as I doe these points, 'twere a braue world. Ioh. So he does, for these are fast now, and loose at night. Pach. Then they are like the loue of a woman. Ioh. Why boy! Do you know what the loue of a woman is! Pach. No faith my Lord, nor you neither, nor any man else I thinke. Ioh. Y'are a noble Villaine. Pach. Would I were, then I should be rich. Ioh. Well get you gonâ Exit. Here's a braue fyle of noble Portugals Haue sworne to helpe me, its hard trusting strangers, Nay more, to giue them footing in a Land Is easie, hard to remoue them; say they and I Should send my Brother King out of this world, And inthrone me (for that's the Starre I reach at,) I must haue Spaine mine, more then Portugall, Say that the Dons and Grandies were mine owne, And that I had the Keyes of the Court Gates Hang at my Girdle; in my hand the Crowne, There's yet no lifting it vp to my head Without the people: I must ride that Beast, And best sit fast: who walkes not to his Throne Vpon their heads and hands, goes but alone; This Dogfish must I catch then, the Queenes Father! (Pedro Valasco) what if I got him! Its but a shallow old fellow, and to build On the great'st, wisest Statesman, in a dessigne Of this high daring, is most dangerous; We see the tops of tall trees, not their heart; To find that sound or rotten, there's the Art. How now Iago? Enter Iago. Iago. Good morrow to your Lordship, The King lookes for you, You must come presently. Ioh. Well Sir: must come! So: florish. As I must come, so he ere long must goe. Exeunt. Enter King, Valasco, Martines, Alphonso. Valasc. And broad awake! King. As is that eye of Heauen. Val. It spake! not, did it? King. No; but with broad eyes, Glassie and fierie stair'd vpon me thus, As blacke, as is a Soule new dipt in Hell; The t'other was all white, a beard and haire Snowie like Portugall, and me thought his looke: But had no armes. Val. No armes! King. No: just my height, Now, and e're this it was shot vp so high, Me thought I heard the head knocke at a Starre, Cleane through the Seeling. Val. Fancy, Fancy. King. I saw it. Val. A meere Deceptio visus. King. A vice Asse; Y'are an incredulous Coxcombe, these saw it. Val. Well; they did, they did. King. I call'd for helpe; these enter'd, found mee dead with feare! Omn. 'Tis right Sir. King. Did not the Spirits glide by thee? Mar. Your Grace must pardon me, I saw none. King. 'Shart doe I lye! doe you braue me! you base Peasant? Mart. No my Lord, but I must guard my life against an Emperor. King. One of my wiues men, is't not! Ha! What a Pox fawnes the Curre for here! away. Exit. Martines. Here Spye Sir! Are you! Val. Sooth him vp, y'are fooles, If the Lyon say the Asses eares are hornes The Asse if he be wise will sweare it, la Sir These tell me they all saw it. Omn. Yes my Lord. Enter Iago. King. And yet I lye a whoreson buzzardâNow sir Iago. Prince Iohn is comming. King. When sir! Iago. Instantly. King. Father Ile tell you a Tale, vpon a time The Lyon Foxe and silly Asse did jarre, Grew friends and what they got, agreed to share: A prey was tane, the bold Asse did diuide it Into three equall parts, the Lyon spy'd it, And scorning two such sharers, moody grew, And pawing the Asse, shooke him as I shake you. Valasc. Not too hard good my Lord, alas I am craz'd. King. And in rage tore him peece meale, the Asse thus dead, The prey was by the Foxe distributed Into three parts agen; of which the Lyon Had two for his share, and the Foxe but one: The Lyon (smiling) of the Foxe would know Where he had this wit, he the dead did show. Valasc. An excellent Tale. King. Thou art that Asse. Valasc. I! King. Thou: you, and the Foxe my Brother cut my Kingdome, Into what steakes you list, I share no more, Then what you list to giue. You two broach Warre or Peace; you plot, contriue, You flea off the Lyons skinne, you sell him aliue, But hauing torne the Asse first limbe from limbe His death shall tell the Foxe Ile so serue him. Valasc. I doe all this! 'tis false in Prince Iohns face Ile spit if he dares speake it, you might ride me For a right Asse indeed if I should kick At you, vndermine you, or blow you vp? In whom the hope of my posterity (By marriage of my child your wife ) doth grow None but an Asse would doe it. King. If I know, your little finger was but in't, neither age; Your place in Court, and Councell, respect of honour, Nor of my wife (your Daughter) shall keepe this head Vpon these shouldersâ Enter Prince Iohn. Valasc. Take it; now here's Prince Iohn. King. How now Brother! Sick! Ioh. Not very well. King. Our Court is some Inchanted Tower you come not neare it. Are you not troubled with some paine i'th head? Your Night-cap shewes you are? Ioh. Yes wonderously,âa kind of Megrim Sir. Ioh. I thinke to bind Your Temples with the Crowne of Spaine would ease you. Ioh. The Crowne of Spaine! my Temples! King. Nay, I but iest, A Kingdome would make any Sicke man well, And Iohn I would thou hadst one. Ioh. It shall goe hard else. Valasc. The King I thanke him sayes that you and Iâ King. What? Valasc. Cut you out sir in steakes: Ile not be silent, And that I am an Asse, and a Foxe you; Haue I any dealings with you? Ioh. When I am to deale sir, A wise man then shall hold the Cards. Valasc. Now I'm call'd foole too. King. Sir if you remember Before he came, you buzz'd into mine eare, Tunes that did sound but scuruily. Val. I buz! What buz! King. That he should sell me to the Portugall. Val. Wer't thou as big as all the Kings i'th world, 'Tis false and I defie thee. King. Nay Sir, and more,â Val. Out with't; no whispering, King. I shall blush to speake it, Harke you, a Poxe vpon't, cannot you sooth His sullen Lordship vp, you see I doe Flatter him, confesse any thing. Val. A good Iest! I should confesse to him I know not what, And haue my throat cut, but I know not why. Ioh. W'ud your Grace Would licence me a while to leaue the Court To attend my health. King. Doe. Ioh. I take my leaueâas for you Sirâ Exit. King. My Lord doe you see this Change i'th Moone, sharpe hornes Doe threaten windy weather, shall I rule you Send to him dead words, write to him your mind And if your hearts be vnsound purge both, all humors That are corrupt within you. Val. Ile neuer write, but to him in person. Exit. Enter old Lady. King. Pray Madam rise. Iag. Doe you know this old furie? Alph. No: what is she? Iag. She's the Kings nuthooke (if report has not a blister on her tongue) that when any Filberd-tree is ripe; puls downe the brauest bowes to his hand: a Lady Pandresse, and (as this yeares Almanacke sayes) has a priuate hot-house for his Grace onely to sweat in: her name the Lady Dildoman: the poore Knight her Husband is troubled with the City Gowt, lyes i'th Counter. K. Ile hang him that stirres in't, the proudest Fawlcon that's pearcht vp nearest the Eagle, if he dare, make this his prey, how many yeares! Lad. Fifteene and vpwards if it please your Grace. Kin. Some two-footed Diuell in our Court, Would thrust you out of all, Inclos'd! or Common! Lad. 'Tis yet inclos'd if it like your Grace. King. Entayl'd! Lad. Newly Entayl'd, as there 'tis to be seene in blacke and white. King. This case my selfe will handle; fee no Lawyer Ile stand for you, ha! Servants of mine turn'd grinders! To oppresse the weake! What slaue is't! from my sight, Least my heau'd hand swerue awry, and Innocence smite. Alph. This Bawd belike has her house pull'd downe. Exeunt King. So: come hither, nearer, where shines this starre? Lad. I'th City, brightly, sprightly, brauely, oh 'tis a Creatureâ King. Young! Lad. Delicate, piercing eye, inchanting voyce, lip red and moyst, skin soft and white; she's amorous, delicious, inciferous tender, neate. King. Thou madst me, newly married! Lad. New married, that's all the hole you can find in her coate, but so newly, the poesie of her wedding Ring is scarce warme with the heate of her finger; therefore my Lord, fasten this wagtayle, as soone as you can lime your bush, for women are Venice-glasses, one knocke spoyles em. King. Crackt things! pox on 'em. Lad. And then they'l hold no more then a Lawyers Conscience. King. How shall I get a sight of this rich Diamond. Lad. I would haue you first disguis'd goe along with mee, and buy some toy in her shop, and then if you like Danae fall into her lap like Iove, a net of Goldsmiths worke will plucke vp more women at one draught, then a Fisherman does Salmons at fifteene. King. What's her Husband? Lad. A flatcap, pish; if he storme, giue him a Court-Loafe stop's mouth with a Monopoly. King. T'hast fir'd me. La. You know where to quench you. King. Ile steale from Court in some disguise presently. Lad. Stand on no ground good your Highnesse. King. Away, Ile follow thee, speake not of hast, Thou tyest but wings to a swift gray Hounds heele, And add'st to a running Charriot a fift wheele. Thou now dost hinder me, away, away.

      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS, II. A shop opened, Enter Bilbo and Lazarillo. Bil. Lazarillo art bound yet? Laz. No, but my Indentures are made. Bil. Make as much haste to seale, as younger Brothers doe at taking vp of Commodities: for Lazarillo, there's not any Deigo that treads vpon Spanish leather, goes more vpright vpon the soles of his Conscience, then our Master does. Laz. Troth so I thinke, now I like my little smirking Mistris as well. Bil. Like her, did not I like her simply, to runne away from her father (where I had both men Seruants and maid Seruants vnder me) to weare a flat cap here and cry what doe you lacke. Enter Gallants. Laz. What is't you lacke Gentlemen, rich garters, spangled roses, silke stockins, embrodered gloues or girdles. Bil. Don sweet Don, see here rich Tuscan hat bands, Venetian ventoyes, or Barbarian shoo-stringsâno poyntâ Exeunt. Gallan. Laz. Their powder is dankish and will not take fire. Bilb.

I haue knowne that voyce, what! Run away! Why how now Bilbo! growne a Shopkeeper! Bil. Iogging on Sir, in the old path to be call'd vpon to beare all offices, I hope one day. Mal. 'Tis well: good fortunes blesse you. Bil. Turn'd Citizen sir, a Counter you see still before me, to put me in mind of my end, and what I must goe to, if I trust too many with my ware, it's newes to see your worship in Siuill. Mal. 'Tis true: but Bilbo, no newes yet of my Daughter? Bil. None. Mal. Not any. Bil. What will your worship giue me, if I melt away all that sow of lead that lyes heauy at your heart, by telling you where shee is. Mal. Prithee step forth, speake softly, thou warm'st my blood, Ile giue thee the best suite Prentize e're wore. Bil. And I can tell you Prentizes are as gallant now, as some that walke with my cozen Bilbo at their sides, you can scarce know 'em from Prentizes of Siuill. Mal. Fly to the marke I prithee? Bil. Now I draw home, doe you see this shop, this shop is my Masters. Mal. So, so, what of all this? Bil. That master lies with my yong mistris, and that mistris is your Daughter. Mal. Ha! Bil. Mum: she's gone forth, this morning to a Wedding, he's aboue, but (as great men haue done) he's comming downe. Enter Cordolente. Mal. Is this he? Bil. This is he. Cord. Looke to the shop. Mal. Pray sir a word? Cor. You shall. Mal. You doe not know me? Cord. Trust me not well. Mal. Too well, thou hast vndone me, Thou art a Ciuill Theefe with lookes demure As is thy habit, but a Villaines heart. Cor. Sirâ Mal. Heare me sirâto rob me of that fire That fed my life with heate (my onely Child) Turne her intoâ Cor. What sir! She's my wife. Mal. Thy Strumpet, she's a disobedient Child, To crosse my purposes; I promis'd her To a man whom I had chosen to be her Husband. Cord. She lou'd him not; was she contracted to him? Can he lay claime to her by Law? Mal. Ile sweare, She told me I should rule her, that she was Affy'd to no other man, and that to please me She would onely take Gazetto. Cord. I will forbeare Sir To vexe you; what she spake so, was for feare, But I ha' done, no Begger has your child I craue no Dowrie with her, but your Loue, For hers I know I haue it. Mal. Must I not see her! Cord. You shall but now she's forth sir. Mal. She has crackt my very heart-strings quite in sunder. Cord. Her loue and duty shall I hope knit all more strongly Sir I beseech your patience, when my bosome Is layd all open to you, you shall find An honest heart there, and you will be glad You h'a met the Theefe that rob'd you, and forgiue him, I am ingag'd to businesse craues some speed, Please you be witnesse to it. Mal. Well I shall, Parents with milke feed Children, they them with gall. Exeunt. Bil. As kind an old man Lazarillo, as euer drunk mull'd Sack. Laz. So it seemes, for I saw him weepe like a Cut Vine. Bil. Weepe; I warrant that was because hee could not find in's heart to haue my Master by th'eares. Enter Tormiella. Laz. My Mistris. Bil. Chafe chafe. Tor. Where's your master. Bil. Newly gone forth forsooth. Tor. Whether, with whom? Bil. With my old Master your Father. Tor. Ha! my Father! when came he! who was with him? What said he, how did my Husband vse him? Bil. As Officers at Court vse Citizens that come without their Wiues, scarce made him drinke, but they are gone very louingly together. Torm. That's well, my heart has so ak't since I went forth, I am glad I was out of the peales of Thunder, askt hee not for mee, was Gazetto with him, Luke was not hee with him ha! Bil. No onely the old man. Tor. That's well, reach my workebasket, is the imbrodered Muffe perfum'd for the Lady? Bilbo. Yes forsooth, she neuer put her hand into a sweeter thing. Torm. Are you sure Gazetto was not with my Father? Bil. Vnlesse he wore the invisible cloake. Tor. Blesse me from that disease and I care not, one fit of him would soone send me to my graue; my hart so throbs? Enter Gazetto and Officers. Laz. What is't you lacke. Bil. Fine Garters, Gloues, Glasses, Girdles what is't you buy, Gaz. I haue a warrant you see from the King to search all Siuell for the woman that did this murther, the act of which has made me mad, misse no shop, let me haue that, which I can buy in some Country for seuen groates Iustice! Off. Your searching house by house this is so spread abroad that 'tis as bad as a scarcrow to fright away the bird you seeke to Catch, me thinks if you walke soberly alone, from shop to shop your bat fowling would catch more wagtailes. Gaz. Well shot Sagitarius, Ile nock as thou bidst mee, Offi. What thinke you of yonder parrot i'th Cage. Gaz. A ropeâhaâpuffeâis the wind with mee. Tor. What stares the man at so. Offi. His wits are reeld a little out of the road way nothing else; Bil. Alas mistris, this world is able to make any man mad. Gaz. Ha ha ha ha. Offi. What doe you laugh at, is this shee. Gaz. No, but I saw a doue fly by that had eaten Carrion it shewd like a corrupted Churchman farewell. Off. Doe you discharge vs then. Exeunt Officers. Gaz. As haile shot at a dunghill where Crowes are. Th'art mine; thankes vengeance; thou at last art come, (Tho with wolly feet) be quick now and strike home. Exit. Enter King and Lady. Laz. What is't you lacke. Bil. What is't you buy. Lady. That's shee. King. Peace; Madam lets try here: Bil. What is't you lack sir! King. A gloue with an excellent perfume. Bil. For your selfe sir! King.

Yes faith Madam, at all adventures Ile make this my measure, shall I mistrisse! Tor. As you please sir. Kin. It pleases mee well. Bil. Then sir go no farder, heer's the fairest in all Spaine, fellow it and take mine for a dogskin. La. Pray forsooth draw it on, if it fit you it fits the party surely. Bil.

Stiffe; as prolixious as you please: nay sir the sent is Aromaticall and most odorous, the muske vpon my word Sir is perfect Cathayne, a Tumbasine odor vpon my credit, not a graine either of your Salmindy Caram or Cubit musk. King. Adulterated I doubt. Bil. No adultery in the world in't, no sophistication but pure as it comes from the cod. Tor. Open more, you shall haue what choyce you please. Bil. You shall haue all the ware open'd i'th shop to please your worship, but you shall bee fitted. King. No no, it needs not: that which is open'd already shall serue my turne. Lady.

Foure Crownes, I haue excellent Hungarian shag bands Madam for Ladies, cut out of the same peece that the great Turkes Tolibant was made of. King. The Great Turke be damn'd. Bil. Doe you want any French Codpeece points Sir, King. Poxe on 'em, they'l not last, th'are burnt i'th dying. Bil. If they be blacke they are rotten indeed, sir doe you want no rich spangled Morisco shoo-strings. King. I like this beard-brush, but that the haire's too stiffe. Bil. Flexable as you can wish, the very bristles of the same Swine that are fatten'd in Virginia. Lad. What comes all to, before vs? Bil. It comes to 4. 5. 6. in all, sixe double Pistolets, and a Spanish Ducket ouer. King. To deare, let's goe. Bil. Madam, worshipfull Don, pray sir offer, if any shop shew you the like ware. Lad.

Pretty Soule; No more! indeed You are the youngest Vine I e're saw planted, So full of hope for bearing; methinks 'tis pitty A Citizen should haue so faire a Tree Grow in his Garden. Torm. I thinke him best worthy, To plucke the fruit, that sets it. Lad, Oh you'd h'a shon At Court like a full Constellation, Your Eyes are orbes of Starres. Tor. Muse my man stayes. La. Your man is come, and sent to fetch your Husband, Trust me you shall not hence, till you haue fill'd This banqueting roome with some sweet thing or other: Your Husband's wonderous kind to you. Tor. As the Sunne To the new married Spring, the Spring to th'Earth. Lad. Some children looke most sweetly at their birth, That after proue hard fauor'd; and so doe Husbands: Your honey Moones soonest waine and shew sharpe hornes. Tor. Mine shall shew none, Lad. I doe not wish it should, Yet be not too much kept vnder, for when you would You shall not rise. Tor. Vmh! Lad. I was once as you are, Young (and perhaps as faire) it was my Fate Whilst Summer lasted and that beauty rear'd Her cullors in my cheekes, to serue at Court: The King of Spaine that then was, ey'd me oft: Lik't me, and lou'd me, woo'd me, at last won me. Tor. 'Twas well you were no City. Lad. Why? Tor. It seemes, You yeelded e're you needed. Lad. Nay, you must thinke, He ply'd me with fierce batteries and assaults: You are coy now, but (alas) how could you fight With a Kings frownes! your womanish appetite Wer't ne're so dead and cold would soone take fire At honors, (all women would be lifted higher) Would you not stoope to take it, and thrust your hand Deepe as a King's in Treasure, to haue Lords Feare you, t'haue life or death fly from your words The first night that I lay in's Princely armes, I seem'd transform'd, me thought Ioues owne right hand. Had snatcht mee vp and in his starry spheare. Plac'd me (with others of his Lemmans there) Yet was he but the shaddow I the sunne. In a proud zodiake, I my Course did runne. Mine eye beames the dyals stile; and had power. To rule his thoughts, as that Commands the hower. Oh you shall find vpon a Princes pillow. Such golden dreames. Tor. I find 'em. Lad. Cry you mercy. Tor. My husband comes not, I dare not stay. Lad. You must. King. You shall. Lad. Before you lyes your way Beaten out by mee, if you can follow doe. Tor. What meanes this, are there bawds Ladies too King. Why shake you, feare not, none here threats your life. Tor. Shall not a lambe tremble at the butchers knife. Let goe your hold, keepe off, what violent hands Soeuer force mee, ne're shall touch woman more, Ile kill ten Monarches ere Ile bee ones whore. King. Heare mee. Tor. Avoyd thou diuell. Lad.

Good pitch let mee not touch thee, Spaine has a King: If from his royall throne Iustice bee driuen, I shall find right, at the Kings hands of Heauen. Lad. This is the King. Tor. The King, alas poore slaue. A Rauen stucke with Swannes feathers, scarcrow drest braue. King. Doe you not know me? Torm. Yes, for a whore-master. Lad. No matter for her scoulding, a womans tongue Is like the myraculous Bell in Aragon, which rings out without the helpe of man. King. Heare me, thou striu'st with Thunder, yet this hand That can shake Kingdomes downe, thrusts into thine, The Scepters, if proud fall, thou let'st them fall Thou beat'st thy selfe in peeces on a rocke That shall for euer ruine thee and thine Thy Husband, and all opposites that dare With vs to cope, it shall not serue your turne With your dim eyes to iudge our beames, the light Of Common fires, We can before thy sight Shine in full splendor, though it suites vs now To suffer this base cloud to maske our brow Be wise, and when thou mayst (for lifting vp Thine arme) plucke Starres, refuse them not, I sweare By heauen I will not force thee 'gainst thy blood, When I send, come: if not, withstand thy good; Goe, get you home now, this is all, farewell. Tor. Oh me! what way to heauen can be through hell. Exit. King. Why diue you so? Lad. I hope your Maiesty, Dare sweare I ha play'd the Pylot cunningly. Fetching the wind about to make this Pinnace Strike Sayle as you desir'd. King. Th'art a damn'd Bawd: A soaking, sodden, splay-foot, ill-fac'd Bawd; Not all the wits of Kingdomes can enact To saue what by such Gulphes as thou art wrack'd, Thou horie wickednesse, Diuels dam, do'st thou thinke Thy poysons rotten breath shall blast our fame, Or those furr'd gummmes of thine gnaw a Kings name! If thou wouldst downe before thy time, to thy crew, Prate of thisâyes; doe, for gold, any slaue May gorge himselfe on sweetes, Kings cannot haue By helpe of such a hag as thou, I would not Dishonour her for an Empire, from my sight. La. Well sir. King. Giue o're your Trade. Lad. Ile change my Coppy. King. See you doe. Lad. I will turne ouer a new leafe. King. We search for Serpents, but being found destroy the, Men drinke not poysons, though they oft imploy them. Exit. Lad. Giue o're! how liue then! no, Ile keepe that still If Courtiers will not, I'me sure Citizens will. Exit. Enter Tormiella, and Gazetto. Gaz. Speake with you. Torm. Ha! good fellow keepe thy way. Gaz.

I, I, good youth call her, She playes the Tortoyes now, you shall 'twixt her and me, See a rare Combat; tell her here's her Father, No, an old swaggering Fencer, dares her at the weapon, Which women put downe men at, Scoulding! boy I will so chide her Sonne. Cord. Pray doe Sir, goe call her? Laz. She's forth Sir with my fellow, a Lady tooke her along. Mal. Taken vp already, it's well, yet I commend her She flyes with birds that are of better wing Then those she spreads her selfe. Cord. Right Sir. Mal. Nay she's wise A subtill Ape, but louing as the Moone, is to the Sea: Cord. I hope she'l proue more constant: Mal. Then is the needle to the Adamant, The God of gold powre downe on both your heads His comfortable showers. Cord. Thankes to your wishes. Mal. May neuer gall be fill'd into your Cup, Nor wormewood strew your Pillow; so liue, so loue, That none may say, a Rauen does kisse a Doue, I am sorry that I curst you, but the string Sounds as 'tis play'd on, as 'tis set we sing. Enter Bilbo. Cord. Where's thy Mistresse? Mal. Ohâpray Sonne, vse Bilbo Caueare well. Where's thy Mistresse? Bil. She's departed Sir. Cord. Departed! whether prithee! Bil. It may to a Lord, for a Lady had her away, I came backe to fetch a Gloue which dropt from the Lady, but before I could ouertake them, they were all dropt from me; my Mistris is to me Sir, the needle in the bottle you wot where. Mal. Of hay thou mean'st, she'l not be lost I warrant. Enter Tormiella, and passes ouer the Stage. Cord. Here she comes now sir, Tormiella, call her. Bil. What shall I call her? Exit. Mal. Nothing by no meanes No let her flutter, now she's fast i'th net, On disobedience, a gracefull shame is set, Cord. A strange dead palsie, when a womans tongue Has not the power to stirre, dumb! call her I say! Enter Bilbo. Bil. Strange newes Sir! Cord. What is't? Bil. Yonders a Coach full of good faces. Cord. That so strange? Bil. Yes to alight at our Gate; They are all comming vp as boldly, as if they were Landlords and came for Rent, see else. Enter Gentlemen and Gentlewomen. 1. Gent.

Well; what wilt thou say, if this be a plot, Of merriment betwixt thy wife and them, For them to come thus, and disguise her thus, Thus whorry her away to some by-Towne, But foure or fiue miles distance from the City, Then must we hunt on Horsebacke, find our game See and not know her in this strange disguise, But the jest smelt out, showts, and plandities Must ring about the Table where she sits, Then you kissing her, I must applaud their wits. Cor. Well, I will once be gull'd in this your Comedy, A while Ile play the Wittall, I will winck Sir, One Bird you see is flowne out of the nest, Mal. What Bird! Cord. A wagtaile, after, flye all the rest. Mal. Come then. Exeunt. Finis Actus secundi.</field>

When the sunne shines so warme, you know not that too, The lambe has am'd the Lyon, the vulture tyers Vpon the Eagles hart, these subtill wyers Chanie Ioue, these balls, from whose flames Cupid drew, His wild fire burnes heere, this you know not too. I loue you, that you know not neither, y'are coy, And proud, and faire, you know this, Tor. I beseech you Let me shake off the golden fetters you tye About my body, you inioy a body Without a soule, for I am now not heere. King. Where then. Tor. At home in my poore husbands armes, This is your Court, that mine. King. Your husbands armes, Thou art his whore, he plai'd the theefe and rob'd Another of thee, and to spoyle the spoyler, Is Kingly iustice, 'tis a lawfull prize That's ta'ne from Pirates; there's are fellow wiues. Tor. Which of your subiects (which abroad adore Your state, your greatnesse, presence and your throne Of sunne beames) thinke you now are with a wanton, Or working a chast wife to become one. King. I worke thee not to be so, for when time Shall iog his glasse and make those sands lye low Which now are at the top, thy selfe shalt grow In selfe same place my Queene does. Tor. What tree euer stood Long and deepe rooted, that was set in blood; I will not be your whore to weare your Crowne. Nor call any King my Husband, but mine owne. King. No! Tor. No 'twere shame 'mongst all our City Dames If one could not scape free, their blasted fames. King. The sound of Bels and Timbrels make you mad As it does a Tyger, the softer that I stroke you The worse you bite, your father and your Husband Are at my sending come to Court, Ile lay Honours on both their backs, here they shall stay Because Ile keepe you here, if you doe frowne The engine which reares vp, shall plucke all downe. Ile fetch 'em to you my selfe. Exit. Tor. Oh who can stifling scape in baser throngs, When Princes Courts threaten the selfe-same wrongs! Exit. Finis Actus tertij.</field>

Y'aue the best welcome which the Court can yeeld, For the King giues it you. Mal. Your Grace is gracious. King. Is this your Father? Mal. My proper flesh and bloud Sir. King. And that your Husband? Cor. Not I sir; I married an honest wench that went in a cap, no whim whams; I did but shuffle the first dealing, you cut last, and dealt last, by the same token you turn'd vp a Court Card. King. Is the man iealous! Cor. No, but a little troubled with the yellow Iaundize, and you know if it get to the Crowne of the head, a man's gon. King. We send not for you hither to be brau'd, Sirrah cast your darts elsewhere. Cor. Amongst the wild Irish Sir hereafter. King. 'Tis our Queenes pleasure that your wife be call'd Her woman, and because she will not loose her, She hath importun'd vs to raise you both; Your name sir? Mal. Mine, Andrada Maleuento. King. Andrada Maleuento we make you Vice-Admirall of our Nauy. Cor. Oh spitefull Comedy, he's not a Courtier of halfe an houres standing, and he's made a Vice already. King. We make thy Husbandâ Cor. A Cuckold doe you not. Mal. Sonne you forget your selfe. Cor. Meddle with your owne office; there's one will looke that none meddles with mine. Mal. Is not a change good? Cor. Yes, of a louzie shirt. King. Take hence that fellow, he's mad. Cor. I am indeed horne-mad, oh me, in the holyest place of the Kingdome haue I caught my vndoing, the Church gaue mee my bane. Tor. What the Church gaue thee, thou hast still. Cor. Halfe parts, I thought one had tane thee vp. Tor. Take me home with thee, Ile not stay here. Kin. Ha! Tor. Let me not come to Court. Mal. The King is vext, let me perswade thee Sonne To wincke at small faults. Cor. What sir Pandarus! Tor. Sends the King you to blush in's roome. Mal. Y'are a baggage. King. Goe tell the lunatique so; Andrada harke, Iag. The King sir bids me sing into your eare, Sweet notes of place and office which shall fallâ Cor. Into my mouth, I gape for 'em. Iag. He bids me aske what will content you. Cor. Nothing, nothing, why Sir the powers aboue cannot please vs, and can Kings thinke you, when we are brought forth to the world, we cry and bawle as if we were vnwilling to bee borne; and when we are a dying we are mad at that. King. Take hence that Wolfe that barkes thus. Cor. I am muzzel'd, but one word with your Maiestie, I am sober sir. King. So sir. Cor. You oft call Parliaments, and there enact Lawes good and wholesome, such as who so breake Are hung by th'purse or necke, but as the weake And smaller flyes i'th Spiders web are tane When great ones teare the web, and free remaine. So may that morall tale of you be told, Which once the Wolfe related: in the Fold The Shepheards kill'd a sheepe and eate him there The Wolfe lookt in, and seeing them at such cheere, Alas (quoth he) should I touch the least part Of what you teare, you would plucke our my hart, Great men make Lawes, that whosoe're drawes blood Shall dye, but if they murder flockes 'tis good: Ile goe eate my Lambe at home sir. King. Part, and thus reckon neuer to see her more. Cor. Neuer! Tor. Neuer thus, but thus a Princes whore. Exeunt. Cor. Thou dar'st not, if thou do'st, my heart is great, Thus wrong'd, thou canst doe little if not threat. Gaz. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Cor. At what dost laugh? Gaz. At a thing of nothing, at thee; why shouldst thou be afraid to fall into the Cuckolds disease. Cor. Because it makes a Doctor an Asse, nothing can cure it, are you answer'd Sir? Gaz. Come th'art a foole, to grieue that thy wife is taken away by the King to his priuate bed-chamber, Now like a booke call'd in, shee'l sell better then ouer she did. Cor. Right sir, but could he chuse no stocke to graft vpon, but that which was planted in my nurserie. Gaz. Ile shew thee a reason for that. Cor. Why? Gaz. Leachers comming to women, are like Mice amongst many Cheeses, they taste euery one, but feed vpon the best: hornes rightly weigh'd are nothing. Cor. How nothing! oh sir, the smallest Letters hurt your eyes most, and the least head-ach which comes by a womans knocking hurts more then a cut to the scull by a mans knocking. Gaz. Yet I warrant thou dar'st sweare the party's honest? Cor. Ha; sweare; not I, no man durst euer sweare for his wife but Adam, nor any woman for her husband but Eue, fare you well sir. Gaz. Whether art flying? Cor. In peices dost not see I'me shot out of a Cannon. Exit. Gaz. Downewards Ile shoote thee, but as Diuels vse Ile tickle at thy tortures, dance at thy stumbling, Play with thee, and then paw thee, 'shalt make me merry The Crowne of blacke deeds that are hatcht in Hell Is to out-liue and laugh, and all's play'd well. Exit. Enter Clowne, and Coxecombe. Clo. I haue not pass'd by a Don, to touch whose hand mine owne was neuer more troubled with a more terrible itch. Cox.

The honey of sweet Complement so turne vp your Tuskes or Mochatoes, that they be not too stiffe, to brisle against my acquaintance. Cox. Your acquaintance is a Limbeck, out of which runneth a perfum'd water, bathing my nosthrils in a strong scent of your embracings: are you of Court Signior? Bil. No Signior of the City: are you a Don of the Citie! Cox. No Signior of the Court City, I smile, Bil. Why. Cox. I assure you Signior, you are to vs of the Court but Animals You are held but as shooing hornes to wait on great Lords heeles. Bil. Let em pay vs what they owe then, and pull on their shoes, and wee'll wait no more. Cox. You are our Apes. Bil. But you are fuller of Apish trickes. Cox. No sooner leape our Ladies into a fashion, but your Wiues are ready to creepe into the same. Bil. Why not; for tho some of your Ladies invent the fashion, some of our wines husbands are neuer pay'd for the stuffe or making. Cox. Giue way with your poore scull to our oares: for I tell thee Signior you of the city, are the flatten milke of the kingdome, and wee of the Court, the Creame. Bil. I tell thee Signior! wee of the City eate none of your Court butter, but some of you munch vp our flatten milk cheese. Cox. Be not too loud; tho you are good ringers in the City, for most of you haue bels at your doores. Bil. Be not you too loud: for you might be good singers at Court but that most of you are spoyled in learning your pricksong. Cox. Bee temporate: I will shew you your City Cinquipace, you beare, sweare, teare, reare, and weare; you beare the Tanckerd, sweare shop oathes, teare money out of debtors throates, reare rich estates, weare good clothes, but carry your Conscience in torne pockets. Bil. Bee attentiue, I will shew you your Court Coranto pace, it consisteth of 5. bees and 3. cees; you borrow of any man, are braue on any termes, brag at any hand to pay, bellow at any that demands it, bite any Catchpole that fangs you, but carry neither Conscience nor coyne in your whole pockets. Cox. Tell mee Signior, tell mee why in the City does a harmlesse signe hang at the doore of a subtill Nicodemus sitting in a shop? Bil. And tell me Signior, tell me, why when you eate our good cheare i'th City, haue you handsome wide chops, but meeting vs at Court, none; your gumme's glew'd vp, your lips coap'd like a Ferret, not so much as the corner of a Custard; if a cold cup, and a dry cheate loafe 'tis well. Cox. Come, come, You are Acornes, and your Sonnes the Prodigals that eate you vp. Bil. Goe, goe, you are Prodigals, and glad of the yellow Acornes we leaue our Sonnes. Cox. I will crosse my selfe when I owe money to a Citizen, and passe by his doore. Bil. I will blesse my selfe, when a Courtier owing me no money, comes neare my doore. Cor.

Troth my Lord I know not, I neuer saw her shot off, a pretty little pocket dag. Ioh. What report giues she? Pach. A very good report of her Husband, but he giues an ill report of her. Ioh. How does the Ladies take it; now the King keepes a Wench vnder the Queenes nose? Pach. They take it passing heauily, it goes to the heart of some of them, that he keepes not them too. Ioh. I heard say they were all once leauing the Court? Pach. True sir, but there was a deuise which stopp'd 'em. Ioh. Who are you! Knocking within. Val. My Lord, we must speake with you. Ioh. What are you? fetch me a weapon Omn. Your friends. King. 'Sdeath breake it open. Enter King Valasco, and others. Ioh. The King; I did not vnderstand your Maiesty. King.

Ioh. Me! King. Thee and the trayterous Portugals to depriue me Of life and Crowne, but I shall strike their King And them, and thee beneath into the earth. Ioh. And lower then earth you cannot. King. Halfe your body is in the graue, it only lackes our hand To cast the dust vpon you, yet you stand On slippery Ice your selfe, and trip at vs Whose foot is fixt on Rocks, but since th'ast, throwne Thy selfe downe neuer looke to rise. Ioh. I care not, I will be little so in debt to you, that I will not owe you so much as God a mercy for my life. King. You shall not then, stand not to ayme at markes Now roue not but make choyse of one faire white Th'ast but one arrow to shoote, and that's thy flight The Admirall knowes our pleasure. Exit. Ioh. And Heauen knowes mine Left in mine enemies hand, are you my Iaylor? Val. No my Lord, I thinke I'me rather left To be your Confessor. Ioh.

A kind of foot-ball slight, my Lord, men vse Exceeding much at Court, your selfe has heard Little shrimps haue thrown men higher then the Guard; But barring this rough play, let's now consider, For what I stay, and what you are to doe. Ioh. Doe what? Val. To die. Ioh. And must you play the Hangman. Val. Breake in fellowes. Guard. Ioh. 'Sdeath what are these? Val. Your Executioners appointed by the King. Ioh. These my Executioners, And you my ouer-seer, wherefore kneele they? Val. To beg your pardon, for they feare their worke Will neuer please you. Ioh. What booke's that they hold This is no time for Dedications. Val. That booke is sent in Loue to you from the King It containes pictures of strange sundry deaths He bids you choose the easiest. Ioh. Then I chuse this. Snatches a Halbert. Val. Your choyce is ill made. Ioh. I'me more sorry Sir, I had rather haue my body hackt with wounds, Then t'haue a Hangman fillip me. Val. My Lord pray pardon me I'me forct to what I doe, 'tis the Kings pleasure To haue you die in priuate. Ioh. Any where Since I must downe, the King might let me fall From lofty Pinacles, to make my way Through an arm'd Feild, yet for all that, euen then Vnlesse I slew a kingdome full of men I should at last be pay'd home: blackest fate Thy worst, I heere defie thee, what the State Appoints 'tis welcome.

Out vpon you, you are a Lawyer, pray get you hence, for you'l not leaue me clothes to my backe if I keepe you company, I'me mad enough now, and you'l make me starke mad. Gaz. I am not what I seeme, no Doctor I But by your Husband sent in this disguise To sound your bosome. Tor. You bob for Eeles, doe you not? Gaz. Here has he lockt his mind vp, but for mee To put a burning linstocke in a hand That may giue fire, and send my Soule in powder, I know not, pardon me, fare you well Lady? Tor. Hist doe you heare? Gaz. The eyes of mercy guard thee Were't knowne for what I venter'd thus, 'twere death, Ile to your husband. Tor. Stay, I am not mad Yet I haue cause to raue, my wits like Bels Are backward rung, onely to fright the Tyrant That whilst his wild lust wanders, I may flye To my sweet husbands armes, here I haue hid The traines I meane to lay for mine escape. Gaz. Excellent, he shall second you. Tor. Should any watch vs! Gaz. All's fast, run mad agen then, the King thinks Me some rare fellow, you shall leaue the Court Now if you'l taste my Counsell. Torm. Ile drinke gall to cure mee of this sicknesse. Gaz. Sit then downe here Ile bind you fast because it shall appeare, That you grow worse and worse, then will I tell The King, the onely course to leaue you well, Is to remoue you home to mine owne Lodging, Ile bind you. Tor. For euer to thee. Gaz. Once hence, you may flye To th'Straights, and then crosse o're to Barbary: So, th'art a Strumpet. Tor. What's that you speake! Gaz. A damn'd one, Dost thou not know me! I am Gazetto! Tor. Mercy. Gaz. Who like a ball of wild-fire haue beene tost To make others sport, but here I burst and kill: A periur'd Strumpet. Tor. I am none, My Father swore that I should marry thee, And then a Tyger and a Lambe had met, I ne're was thine, nor euer will be. Gaz. Sweare thou art not mine, That when I see thy heart drunke with hot oathes, This Feind may pitch thee reeling into Hell, Sweare that thou art not mine. Tor. By heauen I am not, To proue I sweare right to thee, change that weapon, See at my Girdle hang my wedding kniues, With those dispatch mee. Gaz. To th'heart? Tor. Ayme right I beseech thee. Gaz. Ile not kill thee now for spight Because thou begst it. Tor. Then good villaine spare me! Gaz. Neither, heere's that shall sinke thee; to the King Thy iugling and these Letters shall be showne. Tor. Vpon thy head be my confusion The King! I shall both feed his rage and lust, First doome me to any Tortures! Gaz. Thou shalt then sweareâ Vnbinds her. Because I know he'll force the tye a knot, The Church must see and sigh at, if he marries thee, Sweare when he comes to touch thy naked side, To bury him in those sheets, thou art his Bride. Tor. By Heauen that night's his last, my iust hart keepes This vow grauen there. Gaz. Till then my vengeance sleepes, Where is the King? Enter King, Iago, Alphonso, Malevento. Gaz. I haue refin'd That Chaos which confounded her faire mind. Kin. Moue in thy voice the Spheares, wh? next thou speakst, Tormiella. Tor. I am well my fearefull dreame Is vanisht, thankes to Heauen and that good man. King. Thou giu'st me another Crowne, oh Vindicados, The axletree on which my Kingdome moues, Leanes on thy shoulders, I am all thine; Tormiella!

Signior Lupo, why Don, not know me, I am the poore Shopkeeper, whose ware is taken vp by the King. Gaz. You lye. Cor. True, as Iudges doe with their wiues, very seldome, I am Cordolente a poore Gudgin diuing thus vnder water, to see how Neptune and his Mermaides swim together, but dare not come neare him, for feare he sets Dogfish to deuoure me. Gaz. An excellent maske against the marriage, now get a private Coat, the King meanes to haue you stab'd. Cor. He does that already, with the bodkin that sticks in my wifes hayre. Gaz. He has not the patience to stay the dressing of his meat of thy prouiding, he will haue it taken vp, and eate the flesh raw, he will be married incontinently. Cor. Will she set her hands to my hornes? Gaz. Yes, and set them to your head, she followes the steps of her old grandam, all euils take their names from her, the ills of Eue, thy wife for the hoope ring thou marriedst her withall, hath sworne to send thee a Deathes head. Cor. Sworne! Gaz. Sworne, were thy case my case; I would set a Diuell at her elbow in the very Church, I would kill her as she gaue away her hand. Cor. Wilt helpe me to a fit Circle to play the Diuell in? Gaz. Ile place thee, Ile put thy foot into the stirrup. Cor. And I will rid the world of one of his diseases, a loose woman. Gaz.

Enter Cordolente. Cord. Dost thou tell me of thy Proclamations that I am banisht from the Court, that Court where I came to thee, was none of thine, it belongs to a King that keepes open Court, one that neuer wrong'd a poore Begger, neuer tooke away any mans wife, vnlesse he sent his Purseuant death for her: oh thou daring Sacrilegious royall Theefe; wilt thou rob the Church too, as thou hast me! thrust me out of that house too in the Sanctuary, turn'd Diuell in a crowd of Angels! Enter Gazetto. Gaz. Why didst not kill her? Cor. I had no power to kill her Charmes of Diuinity pull'd backe mine Arme, She had Armor of proofe on, (reuerence of the place) She is not married, is she, shorten my paines; Gaz.

And did that Villaine, That Lupo Vindicado's, thrust this vengeance Into thy desperate hand? Tor. That Villaine swore me To speed you, I had dy'd else; me had he murdered, When in a Doctors shape he came to cure The madnesse which in me was counterfeit, Onely to shun your touches. King. Strange preseruation! Enter Iago, Gazetto, and Cordolente. Val. Here comes the traytor! King. Diuell, didst thou tempt this woman 'gainst my life? Gaz. Has she betray'd me, yes, hence Anticke vizors Ile now appeare my selfe. Mal. Gazetto! Gaz. The same. Cor. I ha warm'd a Snake in my bosome. Mal. This is he, To whom by promise of my mouth, (not hers) Tormiella should ha' beene married, but flying him To runne away with this, he in disguise Has followed Both thus long to be reueng'd. Gaz. And were not my hands ty'd by your preuention It should goe forward yet, my plot lay there (King) to haue her kill thee; this Cuckold her, Then had I made him Hawkes-meat. Val. Bloudy Varlet. King. Rare Prouidence, I thanke thee, what a heape Of mischiefes haue I brought vpon my Kingdome, By one base Act of lust, and my greatest horror Is that for her I made away my Queene By this destroyers hand, this crimson Hell-hound That laughes at nothing but fresh Villanies. Gaz. The laughing dayes I wisht for, are now come sir I am glad that leaping into such a Gulph, I am not drown'd, your Queene liues. King. Ha! Gaz. She liues, I had no reason to kill her. Val. A better Spirit Stood at his elbow, then you planted there, My poore Girle your sad Queene, breathes yet. King. Long may she, Fetch her, commend me to her, cheere her (Father.) Val.

Mal. Does the Bell ring out! I care not Your Kingdome was a departing too, I had a place in Court for nothing, and if it be gon, I can loose nothing; I ha' beene like a Lord in a play, and that done, my part ends. King. Yes sir, I purge my Court of such Infection. Mal. I shall find company i'th City I warrant; I am not the first hath giuen vp my Cloake of honour. Exit. Enter Valasco, Iohn, and Queene. King.

Pray noble brother loue this man, he's honest, I ha' made of him good proofe, we should haue had A wedding, but Heauen frown'd at it, and I Am glad 'tis crost yet we'll both Feast and dance, Our Fame hath all this while laine in a Trance: Come Tormiella, well were that City blest, That with but, Two such women should excell, But there's so few good, th'ast no Paralell.
