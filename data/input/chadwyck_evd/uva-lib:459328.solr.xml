      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST NOBLE LADY, THE Lady Mary Countesse of Pembrooke. Behold the worke which once thou didst impose Great sister of the Muses glorious starre Of femall worth, who didst at first disclose Unto our times, what noble powers there are In womens harts, and sent example farre To call vp others to like studious thoughts And mee at first from out my low repose Didst raise to sing of state and tragicke notes Whilst I contented with an humble song Made musique to my selfe that pleasd me best And onely told of Delia and her wrong And praisd her eyes, &amp; plaind mine owne vnrest A text from whence muse had not digrest Had I not seene thy well grac'd Anthonie Adornd by thy sweet stile in our faioe tongue T'expect his Cleopatras company. And that those notions which at first in me The, then dilicious Wilton did impresse That arbor of the Muses grac'd by thee And which did likewise grace thy worthinesse Were growne to apprehend how th'images Of action and of greatnesse figured were Made me attempt t'attire her misery In th'habit I conceiu'd became her care Which if to her it be not fitted right Yet in the sute of nature sure it is And is the language that affliction might Perhaps deliuer when it spake distresse And as it was I did the same addresse To thy cleere vnderstanding and therein Thy noble name, as in her proper right Continued euer since that time hath beene And so must likewise still, now it is cast Into this shape that I haue giuen thereto Which now must stand, being like to be the last That I shall euer herein haue to doo. And glad I am I haue renewd to you The vowes I owe your worth, although thereby There can no glory vnto you accrew Who consecrate your proper memory. Those holy Hymnes the melody of heauen Which Israels singer to his God did frame Vnto thy voice eternall fame hath giuen And shews thee deer to him fr? whence they can In them shall rest thy euer reuerent name So long as Sions God remaineth honored And till confusion hath all zeale bereauen And murthered faith and temples ruined By them great Lady you shall then be knowne When Wilton may lie leuell with the ground And this is that which you may call your owne Which sacrilegious Time cannot confound: Here you suruiue your selfe, here are you found Of late succeeding ages fresh in fame, This monument cannot be ouerthrowne, Where in eternall brasse remaines your name. O that the Ocean did not bound our stile Within these strict and narrow limits, so, But that the musique of our well tund Ile Might hence be heard to Mintium arme &amp; Po, That they might know how far Thames doth out goe Declined Tybur, and might not contemne. Our Northern tunes, but now another while Receiue from vs more then we had from them Or why may not some after comming hand Vnlock these limits, open our our confines, And breake a sunder this imprisoning band T'inlarge our spirits, and let out our designes Planting our roses on the Apinines, And to Iberus, Loyce and Arue to teach That we part glory with their, and our land Being match forworth, comes not behind in speech Let them produce the best of all they may Since Rome left bearing, who bare more th? men And we shall paralell them euery way In all the glorious actions of the men. Our PhÅbus is the same that theirs hath beene, How euer ignorance, phantesticke growne Rates them aboue the valew that they pay, And likes strange notes, and disesteemes our owne They cannot shew a Sidney, let they shew All their choice peeces, and bring all in one And altogether shall not make that shew Of wonder and delight, as he hath done: He hath th'Olimpian prize (of all that run Or euer shall witd mortall powers) possest In that faire course of glory and yet now Sydney is not our all, although our best. That influence had Elizaes blessed peace Peculiar to her glory as it spread That sacred flame of many, and th'increase Did grace the season, and her honored And if the same come now extinguished By the distemprature of time, and cease Suffice we were not yet behind the rest, But had our part of glory with the best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. After the death of Antonius, Cleopatra (liuing still in the monument shee had caused to be built) could not by any meanes be drawne forth, although Octauius CÃ¦sar very earnestly laboured it, and sent Proculeius, to vse all diligence to bring her vnto him: for that he thought it would be a great ornament to his triumphs, to get her aliue to Rome. But neuer would shee put her selfe into the handes of Proculeius, although on a time he found the meanes, (by a window that was at the toppe of the Monument,) to come downe vnto her: where hee perswaded her (all he might) to yeeld herselfe to CÃ¦sars mercy. Which she (to be rid of him) cunningly seemed to grant vnto. After that, Octouius in person went to visite her, to whome she excused her offence, laying all the fault vpon the greatnes, and feare shee had of Antonius, and withall seemed very tractable, and willing to be disposed of by him. Whereupon Octauius, thinking himselfe sure resolued presently to send her away to Rome. Whereof Dolabella a fauourite of CÃ¦sars (and one that was growne into some good liking of her) hauing certified her shee makes her humble petition to CÃ¦sar that he would suffer her to sacrifice to the Ghost of Antonius, which beeing granted her, shee was brought vnto his Sepulchre, where, after her rites performed she returned to the monument, and there dined with great magnificence. And in dinner time, came there one in the habite of a countriman, with a basket of figges vnto her, who (vnsuspected) was suffered to carry them in: And in that basket (among the Figges) were conueied the Aspickes wherewith she did her selfe to death. Dinner being ended, she dispatched Letters to CÃ¦sar, containing great lamentations with an earnest supplication, that she might be intombed with Antonius. VVhereupon CÃ¦sar, knowing what she intended, sent presently with all speede, Menssengers to haue preuented her death, which notwithstanding, before they came, was dispaiched. CÃ¦sario her sonne, which she had by Iulius CÃ¦sar (conueyed before vnto India, out of the danger of the warres) was about the same time of her death murthered at Rhodes; trained thether by the falshood of his Tutor, (corrupted by CÃ¦sar. And so hereby came the race of the Ptolomies to bee wholy extinct, and the flourishing rich kingdome of Egypt vtterly ouerthrowne and subdued.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus I. ScÃ¦na I. Cleopatra. CÃ¦sario. Rodon. Come Rodon, here, conuey from out this coast This pretious iem, the chiefest I haue left, The iewell of my soule I value most, My deare CÃ¦sario: Saue him, saue my theft, Guide him to India, lead him farre from hence, Conceale him where secure he may remaine, Till better fortune call him backe from thence, And Egypts peace be reconcil'd againe, For this is he that may our hopes bring backe, The rising Sunne of our declining state: These be the hands that may restore our wracke, And raise the shattered ruines made of late: He may giue limits to the boundlesse pride Of fierce Octauius, and abate his might, Great Iulius ofspring, he may come to guide The Empire of the world, as his by right. Ro. No doubt he may, deare Soueraigne when the rage Of this confused storme is ouerpast, That furiously now beates vpon this age, And, may be, is too violent at last. And CÃ¦sars fortune which now seems to grow Into th'Ascendent of felicitie, And makes the round and full of glory now, May come to waine likes others wretchednes: No tyrant can prescribe to iniurie: Kings Rights may oft be sicke, but neuer die. Ch. Rodon, my selfe, those turnes of Chance haue seen And known both sides of fortune, worst &amp; best And therefore he, whose birth, whose sexe hath beene Worthier then mine, why should not he reblest Turne backe to rule the scepter of this land? Which ah, how well it would become this hand? O how he seemes the modell of his syre, Now doe I gaze my CÃ¦sar in his face: Such was his gate, so did his lookes aspire, Such was his threatning brow, such was his grace; Hie shouldred, and his forehead euen as hie, And had he not, ay me, bin borne so late, He might haue rul'd the worlds wide Monarchy. And now haue bin the Champion of our State. But O deare sonne, the time yeilds no delaies, Sonne of my youth, flie hence, O flie, be gone, Reserue thy selfe, ordain'd for better daies, For much thou hast to ground thy hopes vpon. Leaue me thy wofull mother to indure The fury of this tempest here alone, Who cares not for her selfe, so thou be sure: Thou maiest reuenge when others can but mone. Rodon will see thee safe, Rodon will guid Thee in the way, thou shalt not need to feare, Rodon my faithfull seruant will prouide What shall be best for thee, take thou no care. And O good Rodon, tender well his youth, The wayes are long, and dangerous euery where; I vrge it not, that I doe doubt thy truth, But mothers cast the worst, and alwaies feare. âThe absent danger greater still appeares, âLesse feares he, who is neere the thing he feares. Rod. Madame, nor can, nor haue I other gage; To lay for this assurance of my troth, But th'earnest of that faith, which all my age Your grace hath tri'd: and which againe by oath Vnto the care of this sweet Prince I vow, Whose safetie I will tender with more heede Then mine owne life. For consider how The life of Egypt stands on his good speed: And doubt not Madame CÃ¦sar left vs hath The posterne gate of Nylus free, to flie, And India lies beyond the bounds of wrath, And owes no homage to his Empery. And there we shall find welcome, there remaine Safe, till good fortune brings vs backe againe. Cle. But ah, I know not what presaging thought My spirit suggests of ominous euent: And yet perhaps my loue doth make me dote On idle shadowes, which my feares present. But yet the memorie of mine owne fate, Makes me feare his and yet why should I feare? His fortune may in time regaine his state, And he with greater glory gouerne here. But yet I feare the Genius of our race, By some more powerfull spirit comes ouerthrowne, Our blood must be extinct, in my disgrace, And Egypt haue no more kings of their owne. Then let him stay, and let vs fall together, If it before-decreed that we must fall: Yet who knowes what may come, let him go thither What Marchant in one vessell venters all? Let vs diuide our starres, goe, goe my sonne: Let not the fate of Egypt find you here. Trie if so be thy Destinie can shun The common wracke of vs, by beeing there. But who is he found euer yet defence Against the heauens, or hide him any where? Then what need I to send thee so farre hence To seeke thy death, that maiest as well die here? And here die with thy mother, die in rest, Not trauelling to what will come to thee: Why should we leaue our blood vnto the East, When Egypt may a tombe sufficient be? O my diuided soule what shall I doe, Whereon shall now my resolution rest? What were I best resolue to yield vnto? When both are bad, how shall I know the best? Stay; I may hap to worke with CÃ¦sar now, That he may yield him to restore thy right. Goe; CÃ¦sar neuer will consent that thou So neere in blood shalt be so great in might. Then take him Rodon, goe my sonne, farewell. But stay: there's something I would gladly say, Yet nothing now. But O God speed you well, Lest saying more, that more might make thee stay. Yet let me speake, perhaps it is the last That euer I shall speake to thee, my sonne, Doe mothers vse to part in such post haste? What must I end when I haue scarce begun? Ah no (deare heart) tis no such slender twine Wherewith the knot is tyde twixt me and thee: That blood within thy vaines came out of mine, Parting from thee, I part from part of me. And therefore I must speake. Yet what? O sonne, Though I haue made an end, I haue done. CÃ¦s. Deare soueraigne mother, suffer not your care To tumult thus with th'honor of your state: The miseries of ours no strangers are, Nor is it new to be vnfortunate. And this good, let your many sorrowes past Worke on your heart t'inharden it at last. Looke but on all the neighbour States beside, Of Europe, Afrique, Asia, and but note What Kings? what States? hath not the Romane pride Ransackt, confounded, or else seruile brought? Aod since we are so borne that by our fate, Against the stormes we cannot now beare saile, And that the boistrous current of their state Will beare downe all our fortunes, and preuaile: Let vs yet temper with the time: and thinke The windes may change, and al these States opprest, Colleagu'd in one, may turne againe to sincke Their Greatnesse, who now holds them all distrest: And I may lead their troupes, and at the walls Of greedie Rome, reuenge the wronged blood Of th'innocent, which now for vengeance calls, And doe th'inthralled Prouinces this good. And therefore my deare mother doe not leaue To hope the best, I doubt not my returne. I shall doe well, let nor your griefe bereaue Your eies of seeing those comforts when they turne. Cleop, Well, worthy sonne, and worthily the sonne Of such a father. And in this thou shew'st From whence thou camst; I say no more: be gone, Grow in thy vertue, as in years thou grow'st Exeunt. Cleopatra sola. Poore comforts can they giue, whom our distresse Makes miserable, and like comfortlesse. Alas, such forced cheering from our owne, Vpon our griefes doe more affliction lay, To thinke, that by our meanes they are vndone, On whom we sought our glory to conuay. Well then, here is a sad daies worke begun: For first, betweene these armes, my Antony Expir'd this day: and whilst I did vphold His struggling limmes in his last extasie, The yet vnclosed wound, which his owne sword Had made before, burst out, imbru'd my wombe, And here with these faire collours of my Lord Which now I weare: I come from out a tombe, To send away this deerest part of me Vnto distresse, and now whilst time I haue, I got t'interre my spouse. So shall I see My sonne dispatcht for death, my loue t'his graue. Exit. SCEMA. II. Octauius. Dircetus. Gallus. Proculeius. What newes brings now Dircetus from our foe, Will Antony yet struggle beeing vndone? Dir. Noe, CÃ¦sar he will neuer vexe thee more. His worke is ended, Anthony hath done. Here is the sword that hath cut off the knot Of his intangled fortunes, and hath freed His grieued life from his dishonor'd blot. Oct. Who is the man that did effect this deed? Dir. His owne hand and this sword hath done the deed. Oct. Relate Dirceus of the manner how. Dir. My Lord when Anthony had made this last And desperate triall of his fortunes, and With all the forces which he had amast From out each coast and corner of the land. Had brought them to their worke, perceiuing how His ships in stead of blowes shooke hands with yours And that his powers by land were vanquisht now, Backe to the city he with griefe retires, Confounded with his fortunes, crying out, That Cleopatra had betraid his trust. Shee all amaz'd, and fearing least he mought In this conceipt to farther rages burst, Hastes to the tombe which shee erected had (A stately vault to Isis temple ioyn'd) And thence caus'd word be sent how she was dead, And had dispatcht her selfe, through griefe of mind. Which when Antonius heard, he straight burst forth Into this passion: what? and hast thou then Preuented me, braue Queene, by thy great worth Hath Cleopatra taught the worke of men? Hath shee outgone me in the greatest part Of resolution, to die worthily? And must I follow? doth shee disappoint Me, of th'example to teach her to die? Come Eros, doe this seruice for thy Lord, The best and greatest pleasure thou canst doe: Imploy this weapon here; come, make this sword That wone me honor, now to saue it to. It is a deed of glory, Eros, this: For these drie deaths are womanish and base. It is for an vnsinewed feeblenesse T'expire in feathers, and t'attend disgrace. Ther's nothing easier Eros then to die, For when men cannot stand, thus they may flie. Eros, his late infranchis'd seruant, takes The sword, as if he would haue done thee deede, And on it falls himselfe: and thereby makes Antonius more confus'd to see him bleed, Who should haue first euented out his breath. O Eros, said he, and hath fortune quite Forsaken me? must I b'out gone in all? What? can I not by losing get a right? Shall I not haue the vpper hand to fall In death? must both a woman, and a slaue The start before me of this glory haue? With that he takes his sword, and downe he falls Vpon the dismall point, which makes a gate Spacious enough for death, but that the walls Of nature, skorn'd to let it in thereat. And he suruiues his death. Which when his loue, His royall Cleopatra vnderstood, Shee sends with speed his body to remoue, The body of her loue imbru'd with blood. Which brought vnto her tombe, (lest that the prease Which came with him, might violate her vow) Shee drawes, him vp in rowles of taffatie T'a window at the top, which did allow A little light vnto her monument. There Charmion, and poore Eras, two weake maids Foretir'd with watching, and their mistresse care, Tngd at the pulley hauing no other ayds, And vp they hoise the swounding body there Of pale Antonius showring out his blood On th'vnder-lookers, which there gazing stood. And when they had now wrought him vp half way (Their feeble powers vnable more to doe) The frame stood still, the body at a stay, When Cleopatra all her strength thereto Puts, with what vigor loue, and care could vse, So that it mooues againe, and then againe It comes to stay. When shee afresh renewes Her hold, and with reinforced power doth straine, And all the weight of her weake bodie laies, Whose surcharg'd heart more then her body wayes. At length shee wrought him vp, and takes him in, Laies his yet breathing body on her bed, Applies all meanes his sences to rewinne Stops vp his wound againe that freshly bled. Calls him her Lord, her spouse, her Emperor. Forgets her owne distresse, to comfort his, And interpoints each comfort with a kisse. He after some small rest and cherishing Raises himselfe, and frames a forced cheere, Wils Cleopatra leaue her languishing, And like herselfe these accidents to beare, Considering they had had so full a part Of glory in this world: and that the turne Of Change was come, and Fortune would depart. T'was now in vaine for her to stand and mourne: But rather ought shee seeke her race to free, By all the meanes (her honor sau'd) shee can, And none about Octauius trust, said he, But Proculeius she's an honest man. And for my selfe, suffize I haue not fail'd In any acte of worth: and now in this, A Roman hath but here a Roman quayld, And onely but by fortunes variousnes. And yet herein I may this glory take, That he who me vndoes, my sword did make. This said, he calls for wine, which he requires Perhaps not for his thirst, but t'end his breath: Which hauing taken, forthwith he expires: And thus haue I declar'd Antonius death. Octa. I grieue to heare this much. And I protest By all the gods, I am no cause of this, He sought his ruine, wrought his owne vnrest; And here these letters are my witnesses, How oft I labour'd to recall him home, And woo'd his friendship, su'd to him for loue: And how he still contemn'd me, skorned Rome, Your selues my fellow cittizens can proue. But Gallus you, and Proculeius haste With speed vnto the cittie to preuent Lest Cleopatra desperat now at last, Bereaue vs of the onely ornament, Which is herselfe, that can our triumphs grace. Or fire the treasure which she hath amast Within that vault, of all the precious stuffe That Egypt yields and disappoint at last Our trauels of the benefit thereof. Supple her heart with hopes of kinde reliefe. Giue words of oyle, vnto her wounds of griefe. CHORVS. Behold what furies still Torment their tortur'd brest, Who by their doing ill, Haue wrought the worlds vnrest. Which when being most distrest, Yet more to vexe their sprite, The hideous face of sinne, (In formes they must detest) Stands euer in their sight. Their conscience still within Th'eternall larum is That euer barking dog that calls vpon their misse. No meanes at all to hide Man from himselfe can find: No way to start aside Out from the hell of minde. But in himselfe confin'd, He still sees sinne before: And winged-footed paine, That swiftly comes behind, The which is euermore, The sure and certaine gaine Impietie doth get, And wanton lose respect, that doth it selfe forget. And Cleopatra now, Well sees the dangerous way She tooke, and car'd not how, Which led her to decay: And likewise makes vs pay For her disordered lust, The int'rest of our blood: Or liue a seruile pray, Vnder a hand vniust, As others shall thinke good. This hath her riot wonne, And thus shee hath her state, her selfe, and vs vndone. Now euery mouth can tell, What close was muttered: How that shee did not well, To take the course shee did, For now is nothing hid, Of what feare did restraine, No secret closely done, But now is vttered. The text is made most plaine That flatterie glos'd vpon, The bed of sinne reueal'd, And all the luxurie that shame would haue conceal'd. The scene is broken downe, And all vncouered lies, The purple Actors knowne Scarce men, whom men despise. The complots of the wise Proue imperfections smoake; And all what wonder gaue To pleasure gazing eies, Lies scattered, dasht, all broke. Thus much beguiled haue Poore vnconsiderate wights, These momentary pleasures, fugitiue delights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS II. SCENA. I. Cleopatra. Charmion. Eras. Yet do I liue, and yet can breath extend My life beyond my life: nor can my graue Shut vp my griefes, to make my end my end? Will yet confusion haue more then I haue? Is th'honor, wonder, glory, pompe, and all Of Cleopatra dead, and shee not dead? Haue I outliu'd my selfe, and seene the fall Of all vpon me, and not ruined? Can yet these eyes indure the gastly looke Of desolations darke and ougly face, Woont but on fortunes fairest side to looke, Where nought was, but applause, but smiles, &amp; grace Whil'st on his shoulders all my rest relyde. On whom the burthen of my ambition lay, My Atlas, and the Champion of my pride, That did the world of all my glory sway: Who here throwne downe, disgrac'd, confounded lies Crusht with the weight of shame and infamie, Following th'vnluckie partie of mine eyes, The traines of lust and imbecillitie. Now who would thinke that I were she who late With all the ornaments on earth inrich'd, Enuirond with delights, ingyrt with state, Glittering in pompe that hearts and eyes bewitc'h, Should thus distrest cast downe from off the height, Leueld with low disgrac'd calamitie. Vnder the weight of such affliction sigh, Reduc'd vnto th'extreamest misery? Am I the woman whose inuentiue pride Adorn'd like Isis skorn'd mortalitie? Ist I would haue my frailtie so beli'd, That flatterie could perswade I was not I? Well now I see they but delude that praise vs, Greatnes is mockt, prosperitie betraies vs. And we are but our selues, although this cloud Of enterpoised-smoake makes vs seeme more. The spreading parts of pompe whereof w'are proud, Are not our parts, but parts of other store. Witnesse these gallant fortune following traines, These summer-swallowes of felicitie, Gone with the heat of all, see what remaines, This monument, two maides, and wretched I. And I t'adorne their triumphs am reseru'd A captiue kept to honor others spoiles, Whom CÃ¦sar labours so to hold preseru'd, And seekes to entertaine my life with wiles, But CÃ¦sar it is more then thou canst doe, Promise, flatter, threaten extreamities, Imploy thy wits, and all thy force thereto, I haue both hands and will, and I can die. Char. Come Eras, shall we goe and interrupt With some perswading words, this streame of mone? Eras. No Charmion, stay the current that is stopt Will but swell vp the more: let her alone. Time hath not brought this hot disease of griefe, T' a Crisis fit to take a medicine yet; Tis out of season to apply reliefe. To sorrowes late begun, and in the fit Calamitie is stubborne in the prime Of new afflictions, we must giue it time. Cle. Shall Rome behold my scepter-bearing hand Behinde me bound, and glory in my teares? Shall I passe by whereas Octauia stands To view my misery, that purchast hers? No, I disdaine that head which wore a crowne Should stoope to take vp that which others giue: I must not be, vnlesse I be mine owne, T'is sweet to die, when we are forc'd to liue. Nor had I staid behind my selfe this space, Nor paid such interest for my borrowed breath, But that hereby I seeke to purchase grace For my distressed seed after my death. Its that which doth my deerest bloud controule, Thats it alas detaines me from my tombe, Whilst nature brings to contradict my soule, The argument of mine vnhappy wombe. But what know I if th'heauens haue decreed, And that the sinnes of Egypt haue deseru'd The Ptolomies should faile, and none succeed, And that my weakenes was thereto reseru'd, That I should bring confusion to my state, And fill the measure of iniquitie: And my luxuriousnes should end the date Of loose and il-dispensed libertie. If it be so, then what need these delayes, Since I was made the meanes of miserie, Why should I not but make my death my praise, That had my life but for mine infamie? And leaue ingrau'd in letters of my bloud, A fit memoriall for the times to come, To be example for such princes good, As please themselues, and care not what become. Char. Deare madam, do not thus afflict your heart No doubt you may worke out a meane to liue, And hold your state, and haue as great a part In CÃ¦sars grace, as Anthony could giue: He that in this sort doth sollicit you, And treates by all the gentle meanes he can, Why should you doubt that he should proue vntrue, Or thinke him so disnatured a man, To wrong your royall trust or dignitie? Cle. Charmion, because that now I am not I, My fortune, with my beauty, and my youth. Hath left me vnto misery and thrall, And CÃ¦sar cares not now by wayes of truth, But cunning, to get honor by my fall. Ch. You know not CÃ¦sars dealing till you try. Cle. To try, were to be lost and then descry. Ch. You to Antonius did commit your selfe, And why might not Antonius so haue done? Cl. I wonne Antonius, CÃ¦sar hath me woone. Er. But madame, you might haue articuled With CÃ¦sar, when Thyrius he of late Did offer you so kindly as he did. Vpon conditions to haue held your state. Cl. Tis true, I know I might haue held my state, If I would then haue Anthony betrai'd, Er. And why not now, since Anthony is dead, And that Octauius hath the end he sought, May not you haue what then was offered? On fairer tearmes, if things were fitly wrought And that you would not teach him to deny, By doubting him, or asking fearefully. Cleop. Fearefully Eras peace, I skorne to feare, Who now am got out of the reach of wrath, Aboue the power of pride. What should I feare The might of men, that am at one with death? Speake ye no more to me I charge you here. What? will you two, who still haue tooke my part In all my fortunes, now conspire with feare To make me mutinie against my heart? No Antony, because the world takes note That t'was my weakenesse that hath ruin'd thee, And my ambitious practises are thought The motiue and the cause of all to be. My constancie shall vndeceiue their mindes, And I will bring the witnesse of my bloud To testifie my fortitude, that binds My equall loue, to fall with him I stood, Though God thou knowst, this staine is wrongly laid Vpon my soule, whom ill successe makes ill: And my condemn'd misfortune hath no aide Against prowd lucke that argues what it will. Defects I grant I had, but this was worst, That being the first to fall, I d'id not first. Though I perhaps could lighten mine owne side With some excuse of my constrained case Drawne downe with power: but that were to diuide My shame, to stand alone in my disgrace. To cleare me so, would shew my affections naught, And make th'excuse more hainous then the fault. Since if I should our errors disvnite, I should confound afflictions onely rest, That from sterne death euen steales a sad delight To die with friends, and with the like distrest. And I confesse me bound to sacrifice To death and thee the life that doth reproue me. Our like distresse I feele doth simpathize, And now affliction makes me truely loue thee. When heretofore my vaine lasciuious Cort Fertile in euery fresh and new-choyce pleasure, Affoarded me so bountifull disport, That I to stay on loue, had neuer leisure. My vagabound desires no limits found, For lust is endlesse, pleasure hath no bound. When thou bred in the strictnesse of the citie, The ryotous pompe of monarchs neuer learnedst Invr'd to warres, in womens wiles vnwitty, Whilst others faind, thou felt'st to loue in earnest Not knowing women loue them best that houer, And make least reckoning of a doting louer. And yet thou camst but in by beauties waine, When new appearing wrinckles of declining Wrought with the hand of yeares, seem'd to detaine My graces light, as now but dimly shining, Euen in the confines of mine age, when I Fayling of what I was and was but thus, When such as we doe deeme in iealousie, That men loue for themselues, and not for vs. Then and but thus thou didst loue most sincerely. (O Antony that best deserud'st it better) This Autumne of my beauty, bought so deerely, For which in more then death I stand thy debtor Which I will pay thee with so true a minde, Casting vp all these deepe accounts of mine As both our soules, and all the world shall find All reckonings cleer'd betwixt my loue and thine. But to the end I may preuent prowd CÃ¦sar, Who doth so eagerly my life importune: I must preuaile me of this little leisure, Seeming to suite my mind vnto my fortune: Thereby with more conuenience to prouide, For what my death, and honor best shall fit, An yeelding base content must wary hide My last designe, till I accomplish it: That hereby yet the world shall see that I, Although vnwise to liue, had wit to die. SCENA II. Octauius. Proculeius. Gallus. Kingdoms I see we win, we conquer Climats, Yet cannot vanquish hearts, nor force obedience Affections kept in close concealed limits, Stand farre without the reach of sword or violence. Who forc'd doe pay vs dury, pay not loue, Free is the heart, the temple of thy mind, The sanctuarie sacred from aboue, Where nature keyes that loose and bind, No mortall hand force open can that dore, So close shut vp and lockt to all mankind, I see mens bodies onely ours, no more, The rest anothers right that rules the minde. Behold my forces vanquisht haue this land, Subdu'd that strong Competitor of mine, All Egypt yeelds to my al-conquering hand: And all their states, and all themselues resigne, Onely this Queene, that hath lost all this all, To whom is nothing left, except a mind, Cannot into a thought of yeelding fall, To be dispos'd as chance hath her assign'd, But Proculeius tell me what y'haue done, Will yet this womans stubborne heart be woon? Pro. My Lord, we haue all gentle meanes impli'd, According to th'instructions which you gaue, And hope in time she will be pacifi'd, And these are all the likelihoods we haue. First when we came into her arched vault, I Gallus set to entertaine the time Below with her, conferring at a grate, Whilst I found meanes vp to the top to clime: He there perswaded her to leaue that place, And come to CÃ¦sar and to sue for grace. She said, she crau'd not life, but leaue to die, Yet for her children praid they might inherit, That CÃ¦sar would vouchsafe in clemencie, To pittie them, though she deseru'd no merit, I now descending in the closest wise, And silent manner as I could contriue, Her woman me descri'd, and out she cries. Ah Cleopatra, thou art forc'd aliue. With that the queene raught from her side her knife, And euen in act to stab her martyred brest, I stept with speed, and held, and sau'd her life, And forth her trembling hand the blade did wrest. Ah Cleopatra, why should you said I, Both iniurie your selfe, and CÃ¦sar so? Barre him the honor of his victory, Who euer deales most mildly with his foe. Liue, and relye on him, whose mercy will To your submission alwayes ready be. With that, as all amaz'd, she held her still Twixt maiestie confus'd, and miserie. Her prowd grieu'd eies, held sorrow and disdaine, State and distresse warring within her soule, Dying ambition dispossest her raigne: So base affliction seemed to controule. Like to a burning lampe whose liquor spent With intermitted flames, when dead you deeme it, Sends forth a dying flash, as discontent That so the matter failes that should redeeme it. So she in spight to see her low borne state, When all her hopes were now consum'd to naught, Skornes yet to make an abiect league with fate, Or once descend into a seruile thought. Th'imperious tongue vnused to beseech, Authoritie confounds with prayers so, As words of rule, conioyn'd with humble speech Shew'd she would liue, yet skornd to pray her foe. Ah what hath CÃ¦sar here to doe, said she, In confines of the dead, in darknes lying, Will he not grant our sepulchers be free, But violate the priuiledge of dying? What must he stretch forth his ambitious hand Into the right of death, and force vs here? Hath misery no couert where to stand Free from the storme of pride, ist safe no where? Cannot my land, my gold, my crowne suffize, And all that I held deare, to him made common, But that he thus must seeke to tyrannize On th'wofull body of a wretched woman? Tell him my frailtie, and the Gods haue giuen Sufficient glory, could he be content, And let him now with his desires make euen, And leaue me heare in horror to lament. Now he hath taken all away from me, What must he take me from my selfe by force? Ah let him yet in mercy leaue me free The kingdome of this poore distressed coarse. No other crowne I seeke, no other good, Yet wish that CÃ¦sar would vouchsafe this grace, To fauour the wofull ofspring of my blood, A mixed issue yet of Romane race. If blood and name be linkes of loue in princes, Not spurs of hate my poore CÃ¦sario may Find fauour notwithstanding mine offences, And CÃ¦sars blood, may CÃ¦sars raging stay. But if that with the torrent of my fall. All must be rapt with furious violence, And no respect, or no regard at all. Can ought with nature, or with blood dispence, Then be it so, if needs it must be so. There staies and shrinkes, in th'horror of her state, When I began to mittigate her woe, And your great mercies vnto her relate. And wisht her not despaire but rather come, And sue for grace, and shake of all vaine feares, No doubt shee should obtaine as gentle doome As shee desir'd, both for her selfe and hers. Wherewith at last shee seem'd well pacifi'd, And gaue great shewes to be content to liue, And said shee was resolu'd your doome t'abide, And to accept what fauour you would giue. And therewithall crau'd onely that she might Performe some obsequies vnto the coarse Of her dead loue, according to her rite, And in the meane time might be free from force. I granting from thy part this her request, Left her for then, as seeming well in rest. Oct. But doe you thinke she will remaine so still? Pro. I thinke, and doe assure my selfe shee will: Oct. Ah, priuat thoghts, aime wide from princes hearts Whose state allow's them not t'act their owne parts. Pro. Why tis her safetie to come yeild to the Oct. But tis more honour for her to diefree. Pro. She may by yeilding work her childr?s good, Oct. Princes respect their honor more then blood Pro. Can Princes power dispence with nature th? Oct. To be a Prince is more then be a man. Pro, Ther's none but haue in time perswaded bin. Oct. And so might shee too, were shee not a queene. Pro. Diuers respects will force her be reclaim'd. Oct. Princes like Lyons neuer will be tam'd. A priuate man may yeild, and care not how, But greater hearts will breake before they bowe. And sure I feare she will not condescend To liue to grace our spoiles with her disgrace. But yet let still a wary troupe attend, To guard her person, and to watch the place: And well obserue with whom shee doth conferre, And shortly will my selfe goe visit her. CHORVS. Sterne, and imperious Nemesis Daughter of iustice, most seuere, That art the worlds great arbitresse, And Queene of causes raigning here: Whose swift-sure hand is euer neere Eternall iustice, righting wrong: Who neuer yet deferrest long The prowds decay, the weakes redresse: But through thy power euery where, Doest raze the great, and raise the lesse The lesse made great doest ruine too, To shew the earth what heauen can doe. Thou from darke-cloi'd eternitie, From thy blacke clowdy hidden seat, The worlds disorders doest discry: Which when they swell so proudly great Reuersing th'order nature set, Thou giu'st thy all confounding doome, Which none can know before it come. Th'ineuitable destenie, Which neither wit nor strength can let, Fast chain'd vnto necessity, In mortall things doth order so, Th'alternate course of weale or woe. O how the powers of heauen doe play With trauailed mortality: And doth their weakenesse still betray, In their best prosperitie: When beeing lifted vp so hie, They looke beyond themselues so farre, That to themselues they take no care; Whilst swift confusion downe doth lay, Their late prowd mounting vanity: Bringing their glory to decay, And with the ruine of their fall, Extinguish people, state and all. But is it iustice that all we The innocent poore multitude, For great mens faults should punisht be, And to destruction thus pursu'd? O why should th'heauens vs include, Within the compasse of their fall, Who of themselues procured all? Or doe the gods in close decree, Occasion take how to extrude Man from the earth with crueltie? Ah no, the gods are euer iust, Our faults excuse their rigor must. This is the period Fate set downe, To Egypts fat prosperitie: Which now vnto her greatest growne, Must perish thus, by course must die. And some must be the causers why This reuolution must be wrought: As borne to bring their state to naughte To change the people and the crowne, And purge the worlds iniquitie: Which vice so farre hath ouergrowne, As we, so they that treate vs thus, Must one day perish like to vs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS III. SCENA. Philostratus. Arius. 2, Philosophers. How deeply Arius am I bound to thee That sau'dst from death this wretched life of mine, Obtaining CÃ¦sars gentle grace for me, When I of all help else despaird but thine: Although I see in such an wofull state, Life is not that which should be much desir'd, Since all our glories come to end their date, Our countries honor, and our owne expir'd: Now that the hand of wrath hath ouergone vs; And that we live in th'armes of our dead mother, With blood vnder our feete, mine vpon vs, And in a land most wretched of all other. When yet we reckon life our dearest good, And so we liue we care not how we liue, So deepe we feele impressed in our blood That touch which nature with our breath did giue, And yet what blasts of words hath learning found To blow against the feare of death, and dying: What comforts vnsicke eloquence can sound? And yet all failes vs in the point of trying. For whilst we reason with the breath of safetie, Without the compasse of destruction liuing, What precepts shew we then, what courage lofetie, In taxing others feares, in counsell giuing? When all this aire of sweet contriued words, Prooues but weake armour to defend the heart, For when this ship of life pale terror boords, Where are our precepts then, where is our arte? O who is he that from himselfe can turne, That beares about the body of a man? Who doth not toyle, and labour to adiourne The day of death by any meanes he can. All this I speake to th'end my selfe t'excuse, For my base begging of a seruile breath, Wherein I my profession did abuse, So shamefully to seeke t'auoyd my death. Arius. Philostratus, that same desire to liue, Possesseth all alike, and grieue not then. No priuiledge Philosophy doth giue, Though we speake more then men, we are but men, And yet in troth these miseries to see, Wherein we stand in most extreame distresse, Might to our selues sufficient motiues be, To loath this life, end weigh our death the lesse, For neuer age could better testifie, What feeble footing pride and greatnes hath, How soone improuident prosperitie, Comes caught, and ruin'd in the day of wrath. See how dismaid confusion keepe those streetes, That nought but mirth and musique late resounded. How nothing with our eie but horror meetes; Our state, our wealth, our glory all confounded. Yet what weake sight did not discerne from farre, This blacke arising tempest all-confounding? Who did not see we should be what we are, When pride and ryot grew to such abounding? When dissolute impietie possest, Th'vnrespectiue mindes of prince and people, When insolent securitie found rest, In wanton thoughts, with lust, and ease made feeble. Then when vnwary peace, with fat fed pleasure, New fresh inuented ryots still detected, Purchas'd with all the Ptolomies rich treasure, Our lawes, our gods, our mysteries neglected. Who saw not how this confluence of vice, This inundation of disorders would S'ugnlph this state in th'end, that no deuice Our vtter ouerwhelming could withhold? O thou, and I, haue heard, and read, and knowne, Of mighty lands, are wofully incombred, And fram'd by them examples for our owne, Which now amongst examples must be numbred. For this decree a law from hie is giuen, An ancient Cannon of eternall date, In Consistorie of the stars of heauen, Entred the booke of vnauoyded fate: That no state can in th'height of happines, In th'exaltation ef their glory stand, But thither once arriu'd, declining lesse, Doe wracke themselues, or fall by others hand. Thus doth th'euerchanging course of things, Run a perpetuall circle euer turning, And that same day that highest glory brings, Brings vs vnto the point of backe returning. Eor senslesse sensualitie doth euer Accompanie our loose felicity, A fatall which, whose charmes doth leaue vs neuer Till we leaue all confus'd with miserie. When yet ourselues must be the cause we fall, Although the same be first decreed on hie, Our error still must beare the blame of all, Thus must it be, earth aske not heauen why. Yet mightie men, with wary iealous hand, Striue to cut off all obstacles of feare, All whatsoeuer seemes but to withstand Their least conceit of quiet held so deare: And so intrench themselues with blood, with crimes, With all iniustice, as their feares dispose, Yet for all this we see, how oftentimes, The meanes they worke to keepe, are meanes to lose. And sure I cannot see how this can lie With great Augustus safetie and renowne, T'extinguish thus the race of Antony And Cleopatra, to confirme his owne. Phi. Why must their issue be extinguished? Ar. It must: Antillus is already dead. Ph. And what CÃ¦sario sprung of CÃ¦sars blood? Ar. Pluralitie of CÃ¦sars are not good. Phi. Alas, what hurt procures his feeble arme? Ar. Not for it doth, but that it may doe harme. Phi. Then when it offers hurt represse the same. Ar. Men seeke to quench a sparke before it flame. Ph. Tis humane an innocent to kill. Ar. Such innocents seldome remaine so still. They thinke his death will farther tumults cease, Competitors are subiects miseries. And to the end to purchase publike peace, Great men are made the pleoples sacrifice. But see where CÃ¦sar comes himselfe to trie, And worke the minde of our distressed queene To apprehend some emptie hope, whereby Shee may be drawne to haue her fortunes seene. Though I thinke Rome shall neuer see that face That queld her Champions, blush, in base disgrace. Exeunt. SCENA II. CÃ¦sar. Cleopatra. Seleucus, Dolabella. What Cleopatra, dost thou doubt so much Of CÃ¦sars mercie, that thou hid'st thy face? Or thinke you, your offences can be such, As they surmount the measure of our grace? Bleo. O CÃ¦sar, not for that I flie thy sight My soule this sad retire of sorrow chose: But that my grieued soule abhorring light Likes best in darkenes my disgrace t'inclose: And here in those close limits of dispaire, This solitarie horror where I bide. I thought not euer Roman should repaire More, after him, who here distressed di'd. Yet now here at thy conquering feete I lie, A captiue soule that neuer thought to bow, Whose happie foote of rule and maiestie, Stood late on that same ground thou standest now. CÃ¦s. Rise madame, rise, your selfe was cause of all, And yet would all were but your owne alone, That others ruine, had not with your fall, Brought Rome her sorrowes, to my triumphs mone, For your dissolu'd that league and loue of blood, Which makes my winning ioy, a gaine vnpleasing, Who cannot now looke out into our good, But through the horror of our owne blood shedding. And all we must attribute vnto you. Cleop. To me? what, CÃ¦sar, should a woman doe, Opprest with greatnesse what was it for me T'contradict my Lord, being bent thereto? I was by loue, by feare, by weakenesse, made An instrument to euery enterprize. For when the Lord of all the orient bade, Who but obeyd, who then his helpe denies? And how could I withdraw my succouring hand, From him that had my heart, and what was mine? The interest of my faith in straitest band My loue to his, most firmely did combine. CÃ¦s. Loue? no, alas, it was th'innated hatred, That you and yours haue euer borne our people. That made you seeke all means to haue vs skattered, To disvnite our strength and make vs feeble. And therefore did that brest nurce our dissention, With hope t'exalt your selfe, t'augment your state, To prey vpon the wracke of our contention, And with the rest our foes to ioy thereat. Cle. How easie CÃ¦sar is it to accuse, Whom fortune hath made faultie by their fall, They who are vanquished may not refuse The titles of reproch th'are charg'd withall. The conquering cause hath right, wherein thou art, The ouerthrowne must be the worser part. Which part is mine, because I lost my part, No lesser then the portion of a crowne, Ynough for me. Ah what neede I vse art To gaine by others but to keepe mine owne? But weaker powers may here see what it is, To neighbour great competitors so neere, If we take either part we perish thus. If newtrall stand, both parties we must feare, Alas what shall the forc'd partakers doe, When they must aid, and yet must perish too? But CÃ¦sar since thy right, or cause is such, Weigh not so heauie on calamitie, Depresse not the afflicted ouermuch; Thy chiefest glorie is thy lenitie. Th'inheritance of mercie from him take, Of whom thou hast thy fortune, and thy name. Creat CÃ¦sar me a queene at first did make, And let not CÃ¦sar now confound the same. Read heare these lines which still I keepe with me, The witnes of his loue and fauours euer, And God forbid it should be said of thee, That CÃ¦sar wrong'd the fauoured of CÃ¦sar: For looke what I haue beene to Antony, Thinke thou the same I might haue beene to thee. And here I doe present you with the note Of all my treasure, all the iewels rare, Which Egypt hath in many ages gote And looke what Cleopatra hath is there. Sel, Nay ther's not all set downe within that rowle, I know some thing, she hath reseru'd apart. Cle. What? vile and gratefull wretch durst thou controwle Thy queene, and soueraigne, caytiffe as thou art? Ces. Hold, hold, a poore reuenge, can worke so feeble hands Cle. Ah CÃ¦sar what a great indignitie, Is this, that here my vassall subiect stands, T'accuse me to my Lord of treacherie? If I reseru'd some certaine womens toyes Alas, it was not for my selfe, God knowes, Poore miserable soule that little ioyes In trifling ornaments, in outward showes. But what I kept I kept to make my way, Vnto thy Liuia and Octauius grace, That thereby in compassion moued, they Might mediate thy fauour in my case. Ces. Well Cleopatra, feare not, you shall finde What fauour you desire or can expect, For CÃ¦sar neuer yet was found but kinde, To such as yeeld and can themselues subiect. And therefore comfort now your drooping minde Relieue your heart thus ouercharg'd with care, How well I will intreat ye you shall finde, So soone as some affaires dispatched are. Til when farewell. Cle. Thanks thrice renowned Cesar, Poore Cleopatra rests thine owne for euer, Dola. No meruaile CÃ¦sar, though our greatest spirits, Haue to the power of such a charming beautie, Bin brought to yeeld the honor of their merits, Forgetting all respect of other dutie. Then whil'st the glory of her youth remain'd The wondring obiect to each wanton eie Before her full of sweet, with sorrow waind, Came to the period of this miserie. If still, euen in the midst of griefe and horror Such beautie shines th'row clouds of age and sorrow, If euen those sweet decaies seeme to plead for her, Which from affliction mouing graces borrow: If in calamitie she could thus moue, What could shee do adorn'd with youth and loue? What could she do then when as spreading wide, The pompe of beauty in her glory dight, When arm'd with wonder shee could vse beside The ingines of her loue, Hope, and Delight. Daughter of meruaile, Beautie, how dost thou Vnto disgracing sorrowes giue such grace? What power showes't thou in a distressed brow To make affliction faire, and teares to grace? What can vndressed lockes, dispoyled haire, A weeping eie, a wailing face be faire? I see then artlesse feature may content, And that true bewtie needs no ornament. CÃ¦s. What in passion Dolabella. What? take heed. Let others fresh examples charme this heate, You see what mischiefes these vaine humors breed, When once they come our iudgements to defeate. Indeed I saw shee labour'd to impart, Her sweetest graces in her saddest cheere, Presuming on that face that knew the art To moue, with what respect so euer t'were. But all in vaine, shee takes her aime amisse, The ground and marke her leuell much deceiues, Time now hath altered all, for neither is Shee as shee was, nor we as shee conceiues, And therefore now tis fit shee were more sage, Folly, in youth is sinne, madnes in age. And for my part, I seeke but t'entertaine In her, some feeding hope to draw her forth, The greatest trophy that my toyle shall gaine, Is to bring home a prizall of such worth. And now since shee doth seeme so well content, To be dispos'd by vs: without more stay, Shee with her children shall to Rome be sent, Whil'st I by Syria, after take my way. Exeunt. CHORVS. Opinion, how doest thou molest Th'affected minde of restlesse man? Who following thee neuer can, Nor euer shall attaine to rest, For, getting what thou saist is best, Yet loe, that best he findes farre wide Of what thou promisedst before: For in the same he lookt for more, Which proues but small when once tis tride, Then something else thou findst beside, To draw him still from thought to thought, When in the end all proues but nought. Farther from rest he findes him then, Then at the first when he began. O malecontent seducing guest, Contriuer of our greatest woes: Which borne of winde, and fed with showes, Doost nurce thy selfe in thine vnrest. Iudging vngotten things the best, Or what thou in conceit designst, And all things in the world dost deeme, Not as they are, but as they seeme: Which shewes, thou ill defin'st, And liu'st to come in present pin'st. For what thus hast, thou still dost lacke: O mindes tormentor, bodies wracke, Vaine promiser of that sweete rest, Which neuer any yet possest. If we vnto ambition tend, Then doest thou draw our weakenesse on, With vaine imagination Of that which neuer hath an end. Or if that lust we apprehend. How doth that pleasant plague infest? O what strange formes of luxurie, Thou straight dost cast t'intice vs by? And tel'st vs that is euer best, Which we haue neuer yet possest. And that more pleasure rests beside, In something that we haue not tri'd. And when the same likewise is had, Then all is one, and all is bad. This Antony can say is true, And Cleopatra knowes tis so, By th'experience of their woe. Shee can say, shee neuer knew But that lust found pleasures new, And was neuer satisfi'd: He can say by proofe of toyle, Ambition is a Uulture vile, That feedes vpon the heart of pride: And finds no rest when all is tri'd. For worlds cannot confine the one, Th'other lists and bounds hath none. And both subuert the mind, the state, Procure destruction, enuie, hate. And now when all this is prou'd vaine, Yet Opinion leaues not here, But sticks to Cleopatra neere, Perswading now, how shee shall gaine, Honour by death, and fame attaine. And what a shame it were to liue, Her kingdome lost, her louer dead: And so with this perswasion led, Despaire doth such a corrage giue, That nought else can her mind relieue, Nor yet diuert her from that thought: To this conclusion all is brought, This is that rest this vaine world lends, To end in death, that all things ends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS III. Seleucus. Rodon. Friend Rodon? neuer in a better hower Could I haue met a friend then now I doe, Hauing affliction in the greatest power Vpon my soule, and none to tell it to. For tis some ease our sorrowes to reueale, If they to whom we shall impart our woes, Seeme but to feele a part of what we feele, And meete vs with a sigh but at a close. Rod. And neuer friend Seleucus found'st thou one, That better could beare such a part with thee, Who by his owne knowes others care (to mone, And can in like accord of griefe agree. And therefore tell th'oppression of thy heart, Tell to an eare prepar'd and tun'd to care, And I will likewise vnto thee impart As sad a tale as what thou shalt declare. So shall we both our mournefull plaints combine I will lament thy state, thou pitty mine. Sel. Well then thou know'st how I haue liu'd in grace With Cleopatra, and esteem'd in Court As one of Councell, and of worthy place, And euer held my credit in that sort, Till now, in this late shifting of our state, Whe thinking to haue vs'd a meane to clime, And fled the wretched, flowne vnto the great, Following the fortune of the present time; I come to be disgrac'd and ruin'd cleane. For hauing all the secrets of the Queene Reueal'd to CÃ¦sar, to haue fauour wonne My treachery hath purchas'st due disgrace, My falshood's loath'd, and not without great reason, For Princes though they get, yet in this case, They hate the traytor, though they loue treason. For how could he imagine I could be Entire to him, beeing false vnto mine owne? And false to such a worthy Queene as shee As had me rais'd, by whome my state was growne. He saw t'was not for zeale to him I bare, But for base feare, and mine estate to settle, Weaknes is false, and faith in cowards rare, Feare finds out shifts, timiditie is subtle. And therefore skorn'd of him, skorn'd of mine owne, Hatefull to all that looke into my state: Despis'd Seleucus now is onely growne The marke of infamie, that's pointed at. Rod. Tis much thou saist, and too too much to feele, And I doe pittie and lament thy fall: But yet all this which thou do'st here reueale, Compar'd with mine, will make thine seem but smal, Although my fault be in the selfe-same kind, Yet in degree far greater, far more hatefull. Mine sprung of mischiefe, thine from feeble minde, Mine stain'd with blood, thou onely but vngratefull. For Cleopatra did commit to me The best and dearest treasure of her blood, Her sonne Cesario, with a hope to free Him, from the danger wherein Egypt stood: And chard'd my faith, that I should safely guide, And close to India should conuey him hence: Which faith, I most vnkindly falsifi'd, And with my faith and conscience did dispence. For skarce were we arriu'd vnto the shore, But CÃ¦sar hauing knowledge of our way, Had sent an agent thither sent before, To labour me Cesaria to betray, Who with rewards and promises so large, Assail'd me then, that I grew soone content, And backe againe did reconuey my charge, Pretending that Octauius for him sent. To make him king of Egypt presently, And in their hands haue left him now to die. Sel. But how hath Cesar since rewarded thee? Rod. As he hath thee; and I expect the same As Theodorus had to fall to me. And with as great extremitie of shame, For Theodorus when he had betraid The yong Antillus sonne of Antony, And at his death from off his necke, conuey'd A iewell: which being askt, he did deny: CÃ¦sar occasion tooke to hang him streight. Such instruments with Princes liue not long: Though they must vse those actors of deceit, Yet still their sight, seemes to obraid their wrong: And therefore they must needs this danger run, And in the net of their owne guile be caught, They may not liue to brag what they haue done, For what is done is not the Princes fault. But here comes Cleopatra wofull Queene, And our shame will not that we should be seene. Exeunt. SCENA. II. Cleopatra. Charmion. Eras Diomedes. Cleopatra reading Dolabella's letter What hath my face yet power to win a louer, Can this torne remnant serue to grace me so That it can CÃ¦sars secret plots discouer What he intends with me and mine to doe? Why then poore beauty thou hast done thy last, And best good seruice thou couldst euer doe me, For now the time of death reueald thou hast, Which in my life didst serue but to vndoe me. Here Dolabella far forsooth in loue, Writes now that CÃ¦sar meanes forthwith to send Both me and mine, the aire of Rome to prooue, There his triumphant Chariot to attend. I thanke the man, both for his loue, and letter, The one comes fit to warne me thus before, But for the other, I must die his debtor, For Cleopatra now can loue no more. Come Diomedes, thou who hast bin one, In all my fortunes, and art still all one, Whom the amazing ruine of my fall, Neuer deterd to leaue calamitie, As did those other smooth State-pleasures all, Who followed but my fortune, and not me. Tis thou must doe a seruice for thy Queene, Wherein thy loyaltie must worke her best. Thy honest care and dutie shall be seene, Performing this, more then in all the rest. Thou must seeke out with all thy industrie, Two Aspicks, and conuey them close to me. I haue a worke to doe with them in hand, Enquire not what, for thou shalt soone see what, If th'heauens doe not my designes withstand, But doe the charge, and let me shift for that. Diom. I who am sworne of the societie Of death, and haue indur'd the worst of ill, Prepar'd for all euents, must not deny What you command me, come there what there will. And I shall vse the aptest skill I may To cloake my worke and long I will not stay. Exit. Cleop. But hauing leaue I must goe take my leaue And last farewell of my dead Antony, Whose dearely honord tombe must here receiue This sacrifice, the last before I die. Cleopatra at the tombe of Antonius. O sacred euer memorable stone, Thou hast without my teares, within my flame, Receiue th'oblation of the wofulst mone. That euer yet from sad affliction came. And you deare reliques of my Lord and loue, Most precious parcels of the worthiest liuer, O let no impious hand dare to remooue You out from hence, but rest you here for euer. Let Egypt now giue peace vnto you dead, Who liuing, gaue you trouble and turmoyle, Sleepe quiet in this euerlasting bed, In forraine land preferd before your soyle. And O if that the spirits of men remaine After their bodies, and doe neuer die: Then heare thy ghost, thy captiue spouse complaine, And be attentive to her miserie. But if that laboursome mortalitie, Found this sweete error onely to confine The curious search of idle vanitie, That would the depth of darknes vndermine Or else to giue a rest vnto the thought Of wretched man, with th'aftercomming ioy Of those conceiued fields, whereon we dote, To pacifie the present worlds annoy Then why doe I complaine me to the ayre? But tis not so, my Antony doth heare: His euer liuing Ghost attends my prayer, And I doe know his houering spirit is neere. And I will speake and pray, and mourne to thee, O pure immortall soule, that deign'st to heare: I feele thou answerst my credulitie. With touch of comfort, finding none else where, Thou knowst these hands intomb'd thee here of late, Free and inforc'd, which now must seruile be, Reseru'd for bands to grace proud CÃ¦sars state, Who seeke in me to triumph ouer thee. O if in life we could not seuer'd be, Shall death diuide our bodies now asunder? Must thine in Egypt, mine in Italy, Be made the monuments of fortunes wonder? If any powers be there whereas thou art, Since our owne countrey gods betraies our cause. O worke they may their gracious help impart, To saue thy wofull wife from such disgrace. Doe not permit she would in triumph shew The blush of her reproch, ioynd with thy shame, But rather let that hatefull tyrant know, That thou and I had power t'auoid the same. But what doe I spend breath and idle winde, In vaine inuoking, a conceiued aide, Why doe I not my selfe occasion find, To breake these bounds, wherein my selfe am staid? Words are for them that can complaine and liue, Whose melting hearts compos'd of baser frame, Can to their sorrowes time and leisure giue, But Cleopatra must not doe the same. No Antony, thy loue requireth more, A lingring death with thee deserues no merit I must my selfe force open wide a dore To let out life, and to vnhouse my spirit. These hands must breake the prison of my soule, To come to thee, there to inioy like state, As doth the long pent solitary foule, That hath escapt her cage, and found her mate. This sacrifice, to sacrifice my life, Is that true incense that my loue beseemes, These rites may serue a life-desiring wife, Who doing them, t'haue done sufficient deemes. My heart-bloud should the purple flowers haue been Which here vpon thy tombe to thee are offred, No smoake but my last gaspe should here bin seene, And this it had bin too, had I bin suffred. But what haue I, saue onely these bare hands, And these weake fingers are not yron-pointed, They cannot pierce the flesh that them withstands, And I of all meanes else am disappointed. But yet I must away, and meanes seeke how To come vnto thee, and to vnion vs, O death art thou art so hard to come by now, That we must pray, intreat, and seeke thee thus? But I will find, where euer thou doest lie, For who can stay a mind resolu'd to die. And now I come to worke th'effect indeed, I neuer will send more complaints to thee, I bring my soule, my selfe, and that with speed, My selfe will bring my soule to Antony. Come, goe my maides, my fortunes sole attenders, That minister to misery and sorrow, Your mistresse you vnto your freedome renders, And will discharge your charge, yet ere to morrow. Eras. Good madame if that worthy heart you beare Doe hold it fit; it were a sinne in vs To contradict your will: but yet we feare The world will censure that your doing thus, Did issue rather out of your despaire Then resolution, and thereby you loose Much of your glory, which would be more faire In suffring, then escaping thus your foes. For when Pandora brought the boxe from heauen Of all the good and ill that men befall, And them immixt vnto the world had giuen, Hope in the bottome lay, quite vnder all. To shew that we must still vnto the last Attend our fortune, for no doubt there may Euen at the bottome of afflictions past Be found some happier turne if we but stay. Cl. Eras, that hope is honors enemie, A traytor vnto worth, lies on the ground, In the base bottome of seruilitie: The beggars wealth a treasure neuer found, The dreame of them that wake, a ghost of th'ayre, That leads men out of knowledge to their graues, A spirit of grosser substance then despaire, And let them Eras hope, that can be slaues. And now I am but onely to attend My mans returne, that brings me my dispatch, God grant his cunning sort to happy end, And that his skill may well beguile my watch So shall I shun disgrace, laeue to be sorry, Flye to my loue, scape my foe, free my soule, So shall I act the last of life with glory, Die like a Queen, &amp; rest without controule. Exeunt. SCENA III. CÃ¦sario , with a Guard conueying him to Execution. Now gentle Guard, let me in curtesie Best me a little here, and ease my bands You shall not neede to hold me for your eye May now as well secure you as your hands. Gu. Doe, take your ease CÃ¦sario, but not long, We haue a charge, which we must needs performe. Ces. Loe here brought back, by subtile traine to death, Betraid by Tutors faith, or traitors rather, My fault, my bloud, and mine offence my birth, For being the sonne of such a mighty father. I now am made th'oblation for his feares, Who doubts the poore reuenge these hands may do him, Respecting neither bloud, nor youth nor yeeres, Or how small safetie can my death be to him. And is this all the good of being borne great? Then wretched greatnesse golden misery, Pompous distresse, glittering calamitie. Is it for this th'ambitious fathers sweat To purchase blood and death, for them and theirs: In this th'inheritance that glories get, To leaue th'estate of ruine to their heires? Then how much better had it been for me, From low descent, deriu'd from humble birth, T'haue eate the sweet-sowre bread of pouertie, And drunke of Nylus streames, in Nylus earth? Vnder the couering of some quiet cottage, Free from the wrath of heauen, secure in mind, Vntoucht, when proud attempts of Princes dotage, Imbroyle the world, and ruinate mankind, So had he not impeach'd their high condition, Who must haue all things cleere, and al made plaine Betweene them, and the marke of their ambition, That nothing let the prospect of their raigne: Where nothing stands, that stands not in submission, Whose greatnesse must all in it selfe containe. Kings will alone, competitors must downe, Neere death he stands, who stands too neere a crown Such is my case, Augustus will haue all, My blood must seale th'assurance of his state, Yet ah weake state, which blood assure him shall, Whose wrongfull shedding, gods and men doe hate. Iniustice cannot scape and flourish still, Though men doe not reuenge it, th'heauens will. And he that thus doth seeke with bloudy hand, T'extinguish th'ofspring of anothers race, May finde the heauens, his vowes so to withstand, That others may depriue him in like case. When he shall see his proud contentious bed Yeilding him none of his that may inherit, Subuert his blood, place others in their steed, To pay this his iniustice, her due merit, If it be true, (as who can that deny Which sacred Priests of Memphis, doe foresay,) Some of the ofspring yet of Antony, Shall all the rule of this whole Empire sway And then Augustus what is it thou gainest By poore Antillus blood, and this of mine? Nothing but this, thy victory thou stainest, And pulst the wrath of heauen on thee and thine. In vaine doth man contend against the starres, For what he seekes to make, his wisedome mars. But in the meane time, he whom fates reserue, The bloody sacrifices of ambition, We feele the smart, what euer they deserue, And we endure the heauy times condition, The iustice of the heauens reuenging thus, Doth onely satisfie it selfe not vs. But yet CÃ¦sario thou must die content, God will reuenge, and men bewaile the innocent. Well now alone, I rested haue ynow, Performe the charge, my friends, you haue to doe. Exeunt. CHORVS. Misterious Egypt, wonder breeder, Strict Religions strange obseruer, State-order zeale the best rule-keeper, Fostring still in temp'rate feruor: O how cam'st thou to lose so wholy, All religion, law, and order? And thus become the most vnholy Of all Lands, that Nylus border? How could confus'd Disorder enter Where sterne Law sate so seuerely? How durst weake lust and riot venter, Th'eye of iustice looking neerely? Could not those meanes that made thee great, Be still the meanes to keepe thy state? Ah no, the course of things requireth Change and alteration euer: That staid continuance man desireth, Th'vnconstant world yeildeth neuer. We in our councels must be blinded, and not see what doth import vs: And oftentimes the thing least minded, is the thing that most must hurt vs. Yet they that haue the sterne in guiding, tis their fault that should preuent it, Who when they see their country sliding, for their priuate are coutented. We imitate the greater powers, The Princes manners fashion ours Th'example of their light regarding, vulgar loosenesse much incenses: Vice vncontroul'd, growes wide inlarging, Kings small faults be great offences. And this hath set the window open vnto licence, lust, and riot: This wry confusion first found broken, whereby entred our disquiet, Those lawes that old Sesostris founded, and the Ptolomies obserued, Hereby first came to be confounded. which our state so long preserued. The wanton luxurie of Court, Did forme the people of like sort. For all (respecting priuate pleasure,) vniuersally consenting To abuse their time, their treasure, in their owne delights contenting: And future dangers nought respecting, whereby, (O how easie matter Made this so generall neglecting, confus'd weaknesse to discatter?) CÃ¦sar found th'effect true tried, in his easie entrance making. Who at the sight of armes, discried all our people, all forsaking. For riot (worse then warre) so sore Had wasted all our strength before. And thus is Egypt seruile rendred to the insolent destroyer: And all their sumptuous treasure tendred, all her wealth that did betray her. Which poyson (O if heaueu be rightfull,) may so farre infect their sences, That Egypts pleasures so delightfull. may breed them the like offences. And Romans learne our way of weakenesse, be instructed in our vices: That our spoyles may spoyle your greatnesse, ouercome with our deuises. Fill full your hands, and carry home Enough from vs to ruine Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS V. SCENA I. Dolabella. Titius. Come tell me Titius euery circumstance How Cleopatra did receiue my newes, Tell euery looke, each gesture, countenance, That shee did in my letters-reading vse. Tit. I shall my Lord, so far as I could note, Or my conceit obserue in any wise, It was the time when as shee hauing gote Leaue to her dearest dead to sacrifice. And now was issuing out the monument With odours, incense, garlands in her hand, When I approch't (as one from CÃ¦sar sent) And did her close thy message t'vnderstand, Shee turnes her backe, and with her takes me in, Reades in thy lines thy strange vnlookt-for tale, And reades, and smiles, and stares, and doth begin Againe to read, then blusht, and then was pale, And hauing ended with a sigh, refolds The letter vp; and with a fixed eye (Which stedfast her imagination holds) Shee mus'd a while, standing confusedly, At length, ah friend, saith shee, tell thy good Lord How deare I hold his pittying of my case, That out of his sweet nature can affoard A miserable woman so much grace, Tell him how much my heauy soule doth grieue Mercilesse CÃ¦sar should so deale with me, Pray him that hee the best aduice would giue That might diuert him from such cruelty. As for my loue, say Antony hath all, Say that my heart is gone into the graue With him, in whom it rests, and ener shall. I haue it not my selfe, nor can it haue, Yet tell him, he shall more command of me Then any whosoeuer liuing can. He that so friendly shewes himselfe to be A worthy Roman and a gentleman. Although his nation fatall vnto me, Haue had mine age a spoyle, my youth a prey, Yet his affection must accepted be That fauours one from whom all run away. Ah, he was worthy then to haue been lou'd Of Cleopatra whiles her glory lasted, Before shee had declining fortune prou'd, Or seene her honour wrackt, her flower all blasted. Now there is nothing left her but disgrace, Nothing but her affliction that can mooue. Tell Dolabella, one that's in her case, Poore soule, needs rather pittie now then loue. But shortly shall thy Lord heare more of me. And ending so her speech no longer staid. But hasted to the tombe of Antony. And this was all shee did, and all shee said. Dol. Ah sweet distressed Lady, what hard heart Could choose but pitty thee and loue thee to? Thy worthinesse, the state wherein thou art, Requireth both, and both I vow to doe: And what my powers and praiers may preuaile, Ile ioyne them both to hinder thy disgrace: And euen this present day, I will not faile To do my best with CÃ¦sar in this case. Tit. And Sir, euen now her selfe hath letters sent, I met her messengers as I came hither, With some dispatch, as he to CÃ¦sar went But knowing not what meanes her sending thither; Yet this he told, how Cleopatra late Was come from sacrifice, how richly clad Was seru'd to dinner, with most sumptuous state, In all the brauest ornaments shee had. How hauing din'd, shee writes and sends away Him, streight to CÃ¦sar, and commanded than, All should depart the tombe, and none to stay But her two maides, and one poore countriman. Dol. When then I know she sendes t'haue audience now And means t'experience what her state can do, To see if Maiestie will make him bow, To what affliction could not mooue him to. And now if that shee could but bring a view Of that rare beawtie shee in youth possest, The argument wherewith shee ouerthrew The wit of Iulius CÃ¦sar and the rest Then happily Augustus might relent, Whilst powerful loue, far stronger then ambition, Might worke in him a minde to be content To grant her asking in the best condition. But beeing as shee is, yet doth shee merit, To be respected for what shee hath beene. The wonder of her kind of powerfull spirit, A glorious Lady, and a mighty queene. And now but by a little weakenes falling To doe that which perhaps sh'was forc'd to doe, Alas, an error past, is past recalling, Take away weakenesse, and take women too. But now I goe to be thy aduocate, Sweete Cleopatra, now Ile vse my heart, Thy presence will me greatly animate, Thy face will teach my tongue, thy loue my heart. SCENA II. Cleopatra. Eras. Charmion, Diomedes. the Guard, and CÃ¦sars messengers. Now Eras; come, what newes hast thou lookt out, Is Diomedes comming yet or not? Eras. Madame, I haue from off the turret top, View'd euery way, he is not comming yet, Cl. Didst thou see no man tending hitherward? Er. None truly madame, but one countriman Carrying a basket as I could discerne. Cle. Alas then Eras I doe feare th'euent Of my designe, for sure he would not stay Thus long I know, did not some force preuent His forward faith, and hold him by the way. Char. Madame there may be many hindrances To counterchecke and interrupt his speed. He hath a wary worke to doe in this He must take time. Cl. Charmion tis true indeed. And yet in all ths time me thinkes he might Effected haue his worke, had all gone right. Er. Alas we euer thinke the stay is more, When our desire is run t'our wish before. Cle. Eras I know my will to haue it done Rides post, and feare in doing to b'vndone Puts spurs thereto: whilst that for which we long Creepes but a foote. Yet sure he staies too long. Good Eras goe and looke out once againe, Yet stay a while, I know it is in vaine. O gods, I craue no other fortune I Of heauen and you, but onely lucke to die: And shall I not haue that. Well, I will yet Write my dispatch to CÃ¦sar, and when that Is done, I will dispatch my selfe, what way So euer, I must vse no more delay. Enter the Guard with Diomedes. Gua. And whither now sir, stay, what haue you there? Diom. Good sirs, I haue a simple present here, Which I would faine deliuer to our queene. Gu. What ist? lets see? Diom. And please you sirs it is Onely a few choice figs which I haue growne In mine owne garden, and are soonest ripe Of any here about, and euery yeare I vse to bring a few vnto our queene. And pray my masters take a taste of them For I assure you they are very good. Gua. No, no, my friend, goe on, and beare them in. Cl. Now Eras, looke if he be comming yet. See here he comes, This is that countriman Which Eras thou discrid'st, O happy man, Can such poore rogues beguile a Princes power? Why then I see, it is our outsides most Doe mocke the world. But tell me are they here? Speake Diomedes. Diom. Madame they are there. Cle. O good-ill lucke, most fortunate distresse, Deare Diomedes, thou hast blest me now: And here, goe take these letters, and dismaske Thy selfe againe, returne to thine owne shape Good Diomedes, and giue CÃ¦sar these. Goe, leaue me here alone, I need no more: I haue but these to keepe a death in store. I will not vse their helpe till needes I must, (And that is now) goe Diomedes goe. Diom. Good madame, I know well this furniture Of death, is farre more requisite, then that Of life, whre such as you cannot endure To be beneath your selues, debas'd in state. I goe t'effect your will as well in this As I haue done in that onely pray Our tutelarie gods to giue successe Vnto the same, and be it what it may. Cl. Come rarest beast, that all our Egypt breeds, How deerely welcome art thou now to me? The fairest creature that faire Nylus feedes, Me thinkes I see, in now be holding thee. Better then death, deaths office thou dischargest, That with one gentle touch canst free our breath, And in a pleasing sleepe our soule in largest, Making our selues not priuie to our death. O welcome now of wonders, wonder chiefe, That open canst with such an easie kay, The dore of life, come gentle cunning theefe, That from our selues so steal'st our selues away And now I sacrifice these armes to death, That lust late dedicated to delights, Offring vp for my last, this last of breath, The complement of my loues dearest rites. What now false flesh what? and wilt thou conspire With CÃ¦sar too, as thou wert none of ours, To worke my shame, and hinder my desire: And bend thy rible parts against my powers? Wouldst thou retaine in closure of thy vaines That enemy, base life, to le: my good? No know, there is a greater pewer constraines Then can be countercheckt with fearefull blood: For to a minde that's great nothing seemes great: And seeing death to be the last of woes, And life lasting disgrace which I shall get, What doe I lose that haue but life to lose? Eras. See, not a yeilding shrinke, or touch of feare Consents now to bewray least sence of paine, But still in one same sweet vnaltered cheere, Her honor doth her dying spirits retaine. Cle. Well now this worke of mine is done, here endes This act of life, that part the fates assign'd What glory or disgrace this world could lend, Both haue I had, and both I leaue behind, And Egypt now the Theater where I Haue acted this, witnes I die vnforc'd, Witnes my soule parts free to Antony, And now prowd tyrant CÃ¦sar doe thy worst. Erw. Come Charmion, come, wee must not onely be Spectators in this Scene, but Actors too. Now comes our part, you know we did agree The fellowship of death to vndergoe. And though our meaner fortunes cannot claime A glorie by this acte, they shall haue fame. Ch. Eras I am prepar'd, and here is that Will do the deed. Er. And here is of the same. Ch. But Eras ile begin, it is my place. Er. Nay Charmion, here I drinke a death to thee. I must be first. Ch. Indeed thou hast preuented me. Yet will I haue this honor to be last Which shall adorne this head, which must be seene To weare that crowne in death, her life held fast, That all the world may see, shee di'd a queene. O see this face the wonder of her life, Retaines in death a grace, that graces death. Colour so liuely, cheere so louely rife, As none would thinke this bewty could want breath. And in this cheere th'impression or a smile Doth seeme to shew shee skorns both death &amp; CÃ¦sar, And glories that shee could them so beguile, And here tels death, how well her death doth please her. Ces. mess. See, we are come too late, this is dispatcht, CÃ¦sar is disappointed of this grace. Why how now Charmion, what is this well done? Ch. Yea very well, and shee that from the race Of so great kings descends doth best become. CHORVS. Then thus we haue beheld Th'accomplishment of woes The full of ruine and The worst of worst of ills: And seeme all hope expeld, That euer sweet repose, Shall repossesse the land, That desolation fills, And where ambition spills With vncontrouled hand, All th'issue of all those That so long rule haue held: To make vs no more vs, But cleane confound vs thus. And canst O Nylus thou Father of flouds indure That yellow Tyber should With sandy streames rule thee? Wilt thou be pleas'd to bowe To him those feete so pure, Whose vnknowne head we hold A power diuine to be? Thou that didst euer see Thy free bankes vncontrould, Liue vnder thine owne care: Ah wilt thou beare it now? And now wilt yeild thy streams A prey to other Reames? Draw backe thy waters flo To thy concealed head: Rockes strangle vp thy waues, Stop Cataractes thy fall. And turne thy courses so, That sandy Desarts dead, The world of dust that craues To swallow thee vp all, Nay drinke so much as shall Reuiue from vastie graues A liuing greene which spred Far flourishing, may grow On that wide face of death, Where nothing now drawes breath, Fatten some people there, Euen as thou vs hast done, With plenties wanton store, And feeble luxurie: And them as vs prepare Fit for the day of mone Lespected not before. Reaue leueld Egypt drie, A barren prey to lie, Wasted for euermore, Of plenties yielding none To recompence the care Of Victors greedie lust, And bring forth nought but dust. And so O leaue to be, Sith thou art what thou art: Let not our race possesse Th'inheritance of shame, The fee of sinne that we Haue left them for their part: The yoake of whose distresse Must still vpbraid our blame, Telling from whom it came, Our weight of wantonnesse Lies heauy on their heart, Who neuer more shall see The glory of that worth They left who brought vs forth. O thou al-seeing light, High president of Heauen, You Magistrates the starres Of that eternall Court Of Prouidence of Right Are these the bounds y'haue giuen Th'vntranspassable barres, That limit pride so short, Is greatnesse of this sort, That greatnesse greatnes marres, And wrackes it selfe, selfe driuen On rockes of her owne might? Doth order order so Disorders ouerthrow? FINIS.</field>
