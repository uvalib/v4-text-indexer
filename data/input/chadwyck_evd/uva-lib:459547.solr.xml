      <field name="fulltext">DEUS (ad Moysen) Moyses, my servant leeffe and dere, and all my people that bine here, yee wotten in Egipte when yee weare out of thraldome I you brought. I will you have noe God but mee; no false godes none make yee. My name in vayne name not yee for that liketh mee nought. I wyll you hould your holy daye and worshippe yt eke alwaye, father and mother all that yee maye, and slea noe man noewhere. Fornication yee shall flee. Noe meanes goodes steale yee, nor in noe place lenge ne bee false wytnes for to beare. Your neighbours wyefe desyre you nought, servante nee goodes that hee hath bought, oxe nor asse, in deede nor thought, nor nothinge that is his, nor wrongefullye to have his thinge agaynst his love and his likinge. In all these keepe my byddinge, that yee doe not amysse. MOYSES Good lorde that art ever soe good, I will fulfill with mylde moode thy commandementes, for I stood to here thee nowe full styll. Fortye dayes now fasted have I, that I might bee the more worthye to lerne this tokenn trulye. Nowe wyll I worke thy will. Tunc Moyses in monte dicat populo: Good folke, dread yee nought. To prove you with God hath this wrought. Take theese wordes in your thought; nowe knowne yee what ys sinne. By this sight nowe yee may see that hee is pearles of postee. Therfore this token looke doe yee, therof that yee ne blynne. DOCTOR Lordings, this commandement was the firste lawe that ever God sent; x poynctes there bineâtakes intentâ that moste effecte ys in. But all that storye for to fonge to playe this moneth yt were to longe. Therfore moste fruitefull ever amonge shortly wee shall myn. After, wee reden of this storye that in this monte of Synaye God gave the lawe witterlye wrytten with his hand in stonye tables, as reede I; before, men honored mawmentrye. Moyses brake them hastelye, for that hee would not wond. But after, played as yee shall see, other tables owt carved hee which God bade wrytten should bee, the wordes hee sayde before. The which tables [shryned] were after, as God can Moyses leare; and that [shryne] to him was deare therafter evermore. Here God appereth agayne to Moyses. DEUS Moyses, my servant, goe anon and kerve owt of the rocke of stone tables to wryte my byddinge upon, such as thou had before. And in the morninge looke thou hye into the monte of Synaye. Lett noe man wott but thow onlye, of companye noe more. MOYSES Lord, thy byddinge shalbe donne and tables kerved owt full soonne. But tell meeâI praye thee this booneâ what wordes I shall wryte. DEUS Thou shalt wryte the same lore that in the tables was before. Hyt shalbe kepte for evermore, for that is my delyte. Tunc Moyses faciet signum quasi effoderet tabulas de monte et, super ipsas scribens, dicat populo. MOYSES Godes folke of Israell, herkens you all to my spell. God bade ye should keepe well this that I shall saye. Syxe dayes bodely worke all; the seaventh sabboath ye shall call. That daye for ought that maye befall hallowed shalbe aye. Whoe doth not this, dye shall hee. In howses forever shall noe man see firste fruyctesâto God offer yee, for soe himselfe beode; purpur and [byse] both too to him that shall save you from woo and helpe you in your neede. Tunc descendet de monte, et veniet rex Balaack equitando juxta montem et dicat. BALAACK I Balaack, kinge of Moab land, all Israell and I had in hand, I am soe wrath I would not wond to slea them everye wight. For there God helpes them so stowtly of other landes to have mastery that yt is boteles wytterly agaynst them for to fight. What natyon doth them anoy, Moyses prayeth anon in hye; then have the ever the victorye and there enemyes the worse. Therfore, how I will wroken bee I am bethought, as mote I thee: Balaham shall come to mee, that people for to curse. Florish. Noe knife nor sworde maye not avayle that ylke people to assayle. That foundes to fight, hee shall fayle, for sycker yt is noe boote. Caste up. All natyons they doe anoye, and my folke commen for to distroye, and oxe that graweth buselye the grasse right to the roote. Whosoever Balaham blesseth, iwys, blessed that man sothlye is; whosoever he cursys fareth amyse, such name over all hath hee. But yett I truste venged to bee with dynte of sword or pollicye on these false losells, leaves mee. Leeve this withowten dowbte, for to bee wroken is my desyre; my heart brennys as whott as fyre for vervent anger and for ire, till this bee brought abowte. âSurgite dei patriae et opitulamini nobis et in necessitate nos defendite.â Therfore, my god and godes all, O mightye Mars, one thee I call! With all the powers infernall ryse now and helpe at neede. I am enformed by trewe reporte how the mediators doeth resorte to wynne my land to there comforte, desended of Jacobs seede. Now shewe your power, you godes mighty, soe that these caytiffes I may destroye, havinge of them full victorye, and them brought to mischance. Sworde. Beate them downe in playne battell, those false losells soe cruell, that all the world may here tell wee take on vengeance. Owt of Egipte fled the bee and passed through the Red Sea. The Egiptians that them pursued trewlye were drowned in that same fludd. The have on God mickell of might which them doeth ayde in wronge and right. Whosoever with them foundeth to fight, hee wynneth little good. They have slayneâthis wott I wellâ through helpe of God of Israell both Seon and Ogge, kinges so fell, and playnly them distroye. Thearefore ryse up, ye goodes eiche one! Ye be a hundrethe godes for one. I would be wroken them upon, for all there pompe and pryde. Therefore goe fetche hym, batchelere, that he may curse these people heare. For sycker on them in no manere may we not wroken be. Miles rex Balack loquitur: Syr, on your errannde will I goon, that yt shalbe donne anone. And he shall wreake you on your fanne, the peopell of Isarell. REX BALACK Yea, looke thou hett him gould great one and landes for to live upon to destroye them as hee cann, these freekes that bine soe fell. Tunc Miles regis Balack ibit ad Balaham et dicat: Balaham, my lorde greetes well thee and prayeth thee soone at him to bee, to curse the people of Judee that done him great anoye. BALAHAM Abyde a whyle there, batchelere, for I may have noe power but yf that Godes will were; and that shall I wete in hye. Tunc ibit Balaham ad consulendum dominum in oratione. Sedens dicat Deus: Balaham, I commande thee kinge Balackes byddinge for to flee. That people that blessed is of mee curse thou by noe waye. BALAHAM Lorde, I must doe thy byddinge though yt to mee be unlikynge, for therby mych wynninge I might have had todaye. DEUS Yett though Balack bee my foe thou shalt have leave thyther to goe. But look that thou doe right soe as I have thee taught. BALAHAM Lorde, yt shall be donne in hight. This asse shall beare me aright. Goe we together anon, syr knight, for leave nowe have I caught. Tunc Balaham et Miles equitabunt simul, et dicat BALAHAM Knight, by my lawe that I live one, nowe have I leave for to gonne, cursed they shalbe everyeychone and I ought wynne maye. Hould the kinge that hee beheight, Godes hoste I sett at light. Warryed the shalbe this night, or that I wynd awaye. MILES Balaham, doe my lordes will and of gould thou shalt have thy fill! Spare thou nought that folke to spill, and spurne ther Godes speach. BALAHAM Frend, I have godes wonder fell; both Ruffyn and Reynell will worke right as I them tell. Ther ys noe wyle to seeke. Tunc Balaham ascendit super asinam et cum Milite equitabit; et in obviam venit Angelus domini cum gladio extricto; et asina videt ipsum et non Balaham, ad [terram] prostrata jacebit; et dicat BALAHAM Gooe forth, Burnell; goe forth, goe! What the divell? My asse will not goe. Served shee mee never soe, what sarrowe soever yt is. What the divell? Now shee is fallen downe. But thou ryse and make thee bowne and beare mee soone owt of this towne, thow shalt abye iwys. Tunc percutiet Balaham asinam suam. Et hic oportet aliquis transformiari in speciem asinae; et quando Balaham percutit, dicat asina: Mayster, thow doest ill secerly, soe good an asse as mee to nye. Now hast thow beaten mee here thrye, that bare the thus abowte. BALAHAM Burnell, whye begylest thow mee when I have most neede to thee? ASINA That sight that before mee I see maketh mee downe to lowte. Am not I, mayster, thy owne asse to beare thee whyther thow will passe, and many winter readye was? To smyte me hyt ys shame. Thow wottest well, mayster, perdee, that thow haddest never non like to mee, ne never yett soe served I thee. Now am I not to blame. Tunc videns Balaham Angelum evaginatum gladium habentem [adorans] ipsum dicat Balaham (Balaham on his knees shall fall sodenly downe and speaketh to the Angell). BALAHAM A, lorde, to thee I make avowe I had noe sight of thee or nowe. Little wyste I that yt was thowe that feared my asse soe. ANGELUS Why hast thow beaten thy asse, why? Nowe am I commen thee to nye, that changed thy purpose soe falsly and nowe wouldest be my foe. If this asse had not downe gonne, I would have slayne thee here anon. BALAHAM Lord, have pittye mee upon, for synned I have sore. Lorde, ys yt thy will that I forth gonne? ANGELUS Yea, but looke thow doe that folke no woe otherwaye then God bade thee doe and sayde to thee before. Tunc Balaham et Miles equitabunt simul et in obviam veniet rex Balaack, et dicat rex BALACK Ah, wellcome, Balaham my frende, for all my anger thow shalt ende if that thy will bee to wende and wreake mee one my foe. BALAHAM Nought may I speake, as I have wyn, but as God putteth mee within to forbye all the ende of my kyn. Therfore, syr, me ys woe. BALACK Come forth, Balaham; come with mee. For one this hill, soe mott I thee, the folke of Israell shall thou see and curse them, I thee praye. Gould and silver and eke pearle thou shalt have, great plentee, to curse them that yt sonne may bee, all that thou sayst todaye. Tunc Balaack descendit de equo et Balaham de asina et ascendent in montem, et dicat Balaack rex. BALAACK Lo, Balaham, now thow seest here Godes people all in feare. Cittye, castle, and ryvereâ looke now. How lykes thee? Curse them now at my prayer as thow wilt bee to mee full deare and in my realme moste of powere and greatest under mee. Tunc Balaham versus austrem dicat. BALAHAM How may I curse here in this place that people that God blessed hasse? In them is both might and grace, and that is ever well seene. Wytnes may I none beare agaynst God that them can were, his people that noe man may dare ne trowble with noe teene. I saye this folke shall have there will, that noe natyon shall them gryll; the goodnes that they shall fulfyll nombred may not bee. Theire God shall them keepe and save and other reproffe shall they none wave; but such death as they shall have I pray God send to mee. BALAACK What the dyvell ayles thee, thow populart? Thy speach is not worth a farte! Doted I hope that thow arte, for madly thou hast wrought. I bade thee curse them everycheone and thow blessest them blood and bone. To this north syde thow shall gone, for here thy deede is nought. Tunc Balaack rex adducet Balaham ad borialem partem montis, et dicat alta voce BALAHAM A, lord, that here is fayre wonninge: halles, chambers great likinge, valles, woodes, grasse growinge, fayre yordes, and eke ryvere. I wott well that God made all this, his folke to lyve in joye and blys. That cursys them, cursed hee is; whoe blesseth them to God is deare. BALAACK Thow preachest, populard, as a pye; the dyvell of hell thee destroye! I bade thee curse my enimye; therfore thow come mee to. Now hast thow blessed them here thrye, for the meanes mee to anoye. BALAHAM Syr kinge, I told thee ere soe thrye I might none other doe. Tunc Balaham vertit se ad orientalem in plagam montis, et respiciens coelum spiritu prophetico dicit: âOrietur stella ex Jacobb et exurget homo de Israell et consurget omnes duces alienigenarum, et erit omnis terra possessio eius.â BALAHAM Now on thinge I will tell you all, hereafter what shall befall: a sterre of Jacobb springe shall, a man of Israell, that shall overcome and have in bond all kinges and dukes of strange land; and all this world have in his hand as lord to dight and deale. BALAACK Goe wee hence; yt is noe boote longer with this man to moote. For God is both crop and roote, and lorde of heaven and hell. Now see I well noe man one lyve agaynst him is able to stryve. Therfore here, as mote I thrive, I will noe longer dwell. Here Balaham speaketh to Balaack: âAbyde a while.â BALAHAM O, Balaack kinge, abyde a whyle. I have imagined a mervelouse wyle thy enimyes how thow shalt begyle, my counsell yf thow take. Ther maye no pestylence them dismaye, neyther battell them affraye. Plenteefull they shalbee aye of gould, cattell, and corne. There God of them takes the cure from passions that hee makes them sure, them to preserve in greate pleasure as hee before hath sworne. Yee shall not them distroye for aye, but for a tyme vexe them yee maye. Marke well now what I shall saye and worke after my loore. Send forth woomen of thy contryeâ namely, those that bewtyfull beeâ and to thy enimyes lett them drawe nye, as stales to stand them before. When the yonge men that lustye bee have percayved there great bewtye, they shall desyre there companye, love shall them soe inflame. Then when they see the have them sure in there love withowten cure, the shall denye them theyre pleasure, except the grante this sameâ to love theyre great solempnitye and worshipp the godes of thy contrye, and all things commenlye with other people to use. Soe shall the theyre God displease and torne themselves to great disease. Then may thow have thy hartes ease, there law when they refuse. BALAAK Balaham, thy counsell I will fulfill. Hit shalbe done right as thow wyll. Come nere, my knight that well can skyll my message to performe. Goe thou forth, thow valyant knight; looke thow ne stopp daye nay night. Bringe those women to [my] sight that shall my enimyes destroye. Spare thou neyther ryche ne poore, wyddowe, mayde, ne ylke whoore; yf shee bee fresh of coloure, bringe her with thee, I saye. MILES My lord, I shall hye faste to doe your wyll in goodlye haste. Truste yee well, at the laste your enimyes yee shall dismaye. The Doctor speaketh: Lordes and ladyes that here bine lente, this messenger that forth was sente as yee have hardâto that intente, these women for to bringeâ soe craftelye hee hath wrought, the fearest women hee hath owt sought; and to Godes people hee hath them broughtâ God knoweth, a perlouse thinge. For when they had of them a sight, manye of them agaynste right gave themselfe with all theyre might those women for to please. And then soone to them they went; to have theyre [love] was there intent, desyringe those women of theyr consent and soe to live in pease. But those women them denyed there love; the sayd yt should be tryed, which they might not elles abyde for fere of great disceyte. Those blynde people sware many an othe that neyther for leeffe nor for lothe at any tyme they would have them wrothe, nor never agaynst them pleade. Soe by these women full of illusion Godes people were brought to great confusion and his displeasure; in conclusion, his law they sett at naught. God to Moysesâleeve yee nowâ bade him sett up a gallowes tree, the princes of the tribes there hanged to bee for sinnes that they had wrought. With that Moyses was sore greved, and generally hee them repryved. Therfore the would him have mischived, but God did him defend. For the good people that tendered the lawe, when they that greate mischyefe sawe, wholye together the can them drawe upon those wretches to make [an] ende. Anon Phinees, a yonge man devowte, captayne hee was of that whole rowte, and of these wretches, withowt dowbt, xxiiii thowsand the slewe. And then God was well content with Phinees for his good intent, as the prophett wryteth verament, and here wee shall yt shewe: âStetit Phinees, et placavit, et cessavit quassatio, et reputatum est ei ad justitiam in generatione suaâ etc. Soone after, by Godes commandement, to the Madianytes the went, and ther they slewe verament Balaham with fyve gyants moe. Lordings, mych more mattere is in this storye then yee have hard here. But the substans, withowten were, was played you beforen. And by this prophecye, leeve yee mee, three kinges, as yee shall played see, honored at his nativitye Christe when hee was borne. Now, worthye syrs both great and smale, here have wee shewed this storye before; and yf hit bee pleasinge to you all, tomorrowe nexte yee shall have more. Prayenge you all, both east and west where that yee goe, to speake the best. The byrth of Christe, feare and honest, here shall yee see; and fare yee well. Finis</field>
