      <field name="fulltext">THE EARL of ESSEX. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE To the EARL of ESSEX. Spoken by Mr. SHERIDAN. Whene'er the brave, the gen'rous, and the just, Whene'er the patriot sinks to silent dust, The tragic muse attends the mournful hearse, And pays her tribute of immortal verse. Inspir'd by noble deeds, she seeks the plain, In honour's cause, where mighty chiefs are slain; And bathes with tears the sod that wraps the dead, And bids the turf lie lightly on his head. Nor thus content, she opens death's cold womb, And bursts the cearments of the awful tomb To cast him up againâto bid him live, And to the scene his form and pressure give. Thus once fam'd Essex at her voice appears, Emerging from the sacred dust of years. Nor deem it much, that we retrace to-night, A tale to which you've list'ned with delight. How oft of yore, to learned Athens' eyes Did new Electras and new PhÃ¦dras rise? In France how many Theban monarchs groan For Laius' blood, and incest not their own? When there new Iphigenias have the sigh, Fresh drops of pity gush from ev'ry eye. On the same theme tho' rival wits appear, The heart still finds the sympathetic tear. If there soft pity pours her plenteous store, For fabled kings and empires now no more; Much more should youâfrom freedom's glorious plan, Who still inherit all the rights of man; Much more should you, with kindred sorrows glow For your own chiefs, your own domestic woe; Much more a British story should impart The warmest feelings to each British heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Essex, Mr. SHERIDAN. Southampton, Mr. HOLLAND. Cecil, Mr. DAVIES. Raleigh, Mr. PACKER. Lieutenant of the Tower, Mr. ACKMAN. Queen Elizabeth, Mrs. PRITCHARD. Countess of Rutland, Miss MOWAT. Countess of Nottingham, Mrs. KENNEDY. Guards, Attendants, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter NOTTINGHAM and CECIL: NOTTINGHAM. Leave me!âAway! CECIL. I cannotâNo, those starts, Those deep fetch'd sighs, these changes of complexion Must have a cause, and Iâ NOTTINGHAM. How dare you, sir?â 'Tis poor, 'tis little in you, thus to pry, To lurk, and watch me in the hour of weakness. CECIL. But as the kind physician, who attends To learn the malady of some lov'd patient, E'er he adventures to prescribe the cure; To bring the healing draught, the balm of friendship. NOTTINGHAM. Friendship from man! perdition on the sex! May ev'ry evil, ev'ry pang they bring To the weak hearts of fond defenceless women, Return in tenfold mischiefs on their heads! CECIL. Are none exempt? Can charity involve The harmless with the guilty undistinguished? Shall he who longs to do, or suffer greatly, To save the dear lov'd object from affliction, Be as the cruel wretch, who caus'd her care? NOTTINGHAM. O Cecil, if indeed you have lov'd truly, If you have felt the stings of slighted passion, Of heart torn hope, and raging disappointment; You then will cast a kindred eye of pity On the most lost, the most undone of women. Essexâ CECIL. âHa! what of Essex? NOTTINGHAM. Read that letter. CECIL. âFrom him? NOTTINGHAM. The Traytorâread, and then revenge. Yet noâthe scroll that would reveal my shame, His triumphâthus I rend to pieces, thusâ As I would tear the heart of the proud writer. CECIL. And could the brave, the gentle, gallant Essex, Could he be this barbarian? NOTTINGHAM. âCould I tell you? Did shame not shut up utteranceâbut in vain I send my eyes around to find a friend. CECIL. And can you be to seek when Cecil stands Before you, suing but to be your slave? Cecil whose strong and self-supported flame Has brav'd the lasting frost of cold indifference. O would you condescend to try his service, What is there he would not attempt? NOTTINGHAM. âO Cecil! If I have seem'd or distant, or averse To your great merit, and your kind regard, Think of the causeâHe claims your full resentment. The cruelâThe ungratefulâHe alone Engross'd me from the World. When soon to Ireland His high commission bore himâtornâdistractedâ Rack'd by a conflict of opposing Passions, Strong love at length prevail'dâHear it not Cecil, What thought would hideâwhere memory recoils, And scarce believes itselfâI sent this manâ I sentâO death to modesty!âI did send himâ My vows, myself, my soul a willing slave, In a fond letter! CECIL. âThat indeed did merit A fair return at least. NOTTINGHAM. âA fair return! The proud, inhuman, the insulting villain! O for a breath, that would at distance blast him! Fair answer said'st thou? Noâby all the powers Of shame, and rage, that work in slighted woman, A rude repulse! CECIL. âAnd yet you love him still? NOTTINGHAM. Love! Cecil, say you, love? Hate, hateâWithin it labours, fell, and deadly. Know'st thou our sex, and think'st that a woman Slighted, refus'd, can love? No, no! the milk, The kindly flow of love is chang'd to gall, Runs with invenom'd poison thro' my veins, And like the basilisk's, my baleful eyes Would shoot swift death, and I could kill with looks. CECIL. Know then, the guardians of your injur'd beauty, Whisper'd e'er this to my prophetick soul The vengeance due: and high as Essex sits, The love and glory of admiring England, He waits but for your voice to doom his fall, Then sinks to quick perdition. NOTTINGHAM. âDown with him, From his proud height, to the unbottom'd deep; Altho' the gorge of his wide opening gulph Should swallow thousands. Yes, if Cecil bids, Fate signs the mandate: Cecil's breath alone Informs our councils, and arrays our armies; Fills out the wide expanse of Britain's sails, And steers the vessel proudly through the world. CECIL. Praise from that mouth is high reward! what more, What may he hope who vindicates your charms, And slakes your thirsty soul with noble vengeance? NOTTINGHAM. My hand, my heart are his. CECIL. âWith such reward In view, what shall I not atchieve? Then know The queen prepares for council; wait her presence, And you shall hear of mischief, such as minds That soar uncommon flights alone can relish. NOTTINGHAM. I go, I fly! O be the moments short, Till vengeance come to ease my tortur'd soul! [Exit Nottingham CECIL alone. The fate of Essex leaves my road smooth pav'd To love, as to ambitionâWhat altho' Both objects be enforc'd? Reluctance gives Impatient bliss, and heightens the enjoyment. Southampton here! The second man on earth Who stirs my fear, and therefore claims my hatred. A stately branch he is, ingrafted firm To the proud stem of our aspiring Essex; But hew the hostile trunk, and every bough Partakes the kindred ruin. Enter SOUTHAMPTON. CECIL. Fair morning wait upon the brave Southampton. SOUTHAMPTON. Not so, my Lord, there hangs a cloud upon it; Pregnant with pois'nous vapours, as they say, Exhal'd from Cecil's breath, to blast the land, And nip her brightest blossoms. CECIL. âGood my lord, Is mystery the mode? What means your Lordship? SOUTHAMPTON. No mystery to Cecil's conscious spirit: 'Tis rumour'd that some dark malignant faction Are leagu'd with hell, in plotting an impeachment Of the most loyal heart that England holds, Our great, our glorious Essex. CECIL. âI have heard Somewhat of this, and as I know the earl Valiant and noble, wish he may find means To clear the charge of guilt. SOUTHAMPTON. âGuilt! said you guilt? Come shew this monster of your own creation, The phantom that state wizzards conjure up Amid the depth of their nocturnal councils, To make their power look dreadful o'er the land, And scare our Britons from the side of virtue. CECIL. My lord your zeal to this unhappy man, Has clos'd your eyes to what a nation sees With clear, unsway'd discernment; his ambition, His late cabal with rebels, and the storm Brew'd, and concerted with his Irish colleagues To wreak the peace, and honour of his country. SOUTHAMPTON. Rather concerted in the cabinet, Where spurious treasons are begot, and taught To call some pre-appointed victim, father; As statesmen please to bid, where'er they find Talents to cross, or virtue to offend them. CECIL. Be witness for me that I urge you not To this rash mood, but rather warn Southampton To bear himself aloof, sedate, and separate; Lest he be held a partner of that guilt Which such attachment warrants. SOUTHAMPTON. Patience heaven! Shall insolence unpunish'd thus presume To blot the visage of untainted loyalty? Dare you proclaim a hunting thro' the land, And point out worth and honour for the quarry? Base politician!âBy the sacred name That warms a Briton's breast, by liberty! There's not a peasant in the train of Essex, But has a fund of golden honesty, Beyond what Cecil, and his close cabal, With all their worth can weigh. CECIL. I answer not such railingâFare you wellâ And if you are a friend to bold Southampton Bid him not cross the way that Cecil walks, Or look to fall with Essex. [Exit Cecil. SOUTHAMPTON. Fall with Essex! Statesman 'tis false, he sits above your soaring, Too high for Cecil with his cumbrous load Of grov'ling guilt to reachâYet since he dares To threat thus openly, the danger's near. I'll in to council straight, and there perhaps Their secret machinations may break forth. Scene draws and discovers the QUEEN, NOTTINGHAM, CECIL and Attendants. QUEEN. From Spain, my lords, have you had tydings lately By any private letters, that import Their new designs? CECIL. Not any, royal madam. QUEEN. 'Twas rumour'd some time since, that they intended A second visit, and a new armada; But the last pacquet from our agent there, Speaks no such purpose. CECIL. âNo, my glorious mistress, They're sick, war-surfeited, they yet do pant From the sore memory of their old encounter. SOUTHAMPTON. While time shall travel down from age to age, Leading white-handed faith, and liberty To nations yet unborn, oft shall they turn, And thro' past worlds roll back their grateful eye, On your distinguish'd day! Wherein the powers Of darkness were confederate; when Rome Rose up with all her champions, to impose Chains on the limbs, and night upon the mind: Then had the worlds of freedom, and of truth, Return'd to chaos; but Elizabeth, Heaven's minister below, sent forth her sons Of light, and order; her immortal Drake, Her glorious Essex, and all conquering host Of freeborn Britons: heaven that day avow'd His virgin champion, and confirm'd the gift, Th'eternal gift of liberty to man. QUEEN. Yes, my all dear, my still unconquered people! You have deriv'd a glory on your queen, That lifts her sex above the conquering chiefs Of Egypt, or of Macedon: they fought Imposing slavery, we conferring freedom. CECIL. You are too gracious; heaven but make us equal To the least part of all your wondrous bounties! So should Tyrone, and wild rebellion, soon Sink underneath the force of loyalty, And Britain's host still find a faithful leader. QUEEN. Why, Cecil, have you fresh accounts from Ireland? CECIL. Nothing, my royal mistress, more than usual, Old ills repeated. SOUTHAMPTON. âNow the snake begins To wind his venom'd train. QUEEN. âWhat ills, good Cecil? CECIL. Amazing grace! how willingly your majesty Forgets the faults committed by a subject. QUEEN. That Essex (you would say) so vers'd in conquest, For once became remiss, and lost a seasonâ Is not that all? CECIL. âAnd holds close amity With the most dreadful foe of queen, and country, The fierce Tyrone; confers in secret with him; Parlies with traitors, and cabals with rebels, No friend to Britain present, whence ensue Scandalous truces, shameful toâ QUEEN. âHold, Cecilâ You grow inveterate, 'tis his first offence; None here can boast perfection: Essex too, Like us, good statesman, may not want his failings. I would not be extreme to condemnation, Nor clear in his excuse. I've therefore sent him Commands of purpos'd chiding, that enjoin Quick reparation; never more to bend His brow unlaurel'd to the coast of Britain. Enter Sir WALTHER RALEIGH, and others of the Commons. CECIL. May it please your majesty, your faithful Raleigh, And others in commission from your Commons, Attend with their address, and some few bills, Humbly presented for your people's safety. QUEEN. Ay, that's a theme, to which my charmed ear Could list for everâWelcome to your queen, To your true servant welcome! Give me to know How I may best attain the glorious end For which alone I wish to live; to feast Upon that royal luxury of soul, The peace, the weal, the bliss of my kind people. RALEIGH. Immortal health, and never ending joys, To the imperial majesty of England! Bright star of Christendom! the virgin light Which guides our steps to truth, our arms to honour! Queen of true-hearted Britons! who do wish The sun should be extinguish'd in his orb, Ere you their better glory should decline, And leave your realms in more lamented darkness! Your parliament in care of these your kingdoms, (Who live but in your life) present three bills With humblest suit to pass them into acts For the dear safety for your throne, and person. QUEEN. Let Cecil see what they contain. CECIL. âThe first Is for establishing a train'd militia Thro' every shire; and for a farther levy Of certain horse, and foot, as a strong guard Of safety, to our queen's most sacred person. The secondâThat two hundred thousand pounds Be rais'd in part for payment of those troops, Farther to be dispos'd of as our sovereign In her dear pleasure shall appoint. QUEEN. âHow poor Were thanks to such a people! but be sure For you I'll prove a thrifty usurer; And every talent trusted to your queen, Shall be return'd with fivefold interest Of love, and due beneficence.âProceed. CECIL. The third consists of several articles Expressive of your subjects just abhorrence Of plots, and treas'nous practicesâconcluding With a submissive prayer, most humbly offer'd For the impeaching Robert earl of Essex. QUEEN. Who dares impeach him? whence this insolence Without my privity? Am I awake? Say, am I England's queen? do you know me, Nottingham? NOTTINGHAM. You are our queen, our royal mistress? QUEEN. âNo! 'Tis false, a waxen pageant, set aloft For statesmen's hands to mould, and move at will. How was I lull'd! Ha! Rebels! well ye warn Of plots, and treasonous practicesâYe smooth ones, Who, like hyÃ¦na, make your sly approaches, By whine, and cringeâthen leap with quick surprize, And rend your feeder. Come, what would you farther? 'Tis yours to dictate, my imperial masters! At your command I'll drench my innocence In the most brave and loyal blood of England; Tread out offensive virtue, pluck fidelity Even from the heart of Britain. You my masters! Shall rule unrival'd then, and your ambition Be prop'd by guardians like unto yourselves; Fools for your senate, knaves for every office, And cowards for commanders. SOUTHAMPTON. âHorrid plot! Most wicked combination! what shall guard The throne or kingdom, when their fences thus Are sapt in secret, or confessedly Assail'd in open day? when even your Essex, That glorious man, by whose undaunted courage The cowards that impeach him live in safety; When he must fall to make a public breach, Where mask'd ambition may encroach on majesty, And treasons gain free entrance. QUEEN. That I have lov'd thee, BritainâO how truly! With such a love! too much of thatâBut had I, Had I the spirit of my father Harry, I had array'd my majesty in terrors, And thence deriv'd respect; held the rein hard, And the lash active; then you had known your ruler; Yes, ye petitioners for blood! you then Should have been glutted, even with the blood Of your own crew, untill the gorged stream Had choak'd your faction. CECIL. âFirst, and best of monarchs, Vex nor your royal heart; not all our lives Are worth the least emotion, that may give Your sovereign mind disturbance. QUEEN. âO 'tis plain I've reign'd too long; their hunger is variety: They've ta'en a jewish surfeit of their sweets, And thence have turn'd to loathing.â'Tis enoughâ Their pleasures be fulfill'dâThou pageant sceptre, Thou banisher of truth, that do'st invite The bow of flattery, and the smile of falshood; Thus do I hurl thee to thy worshipers, And am myself aloneâ [Throws away the sceptre. RALEIGH. O queen ador'd, rever'd to adoration! Lo! to the dust beneath your dread rebuke, All aw'd, and humbl'd, your repentant subjects Fall prostrate for forgiveness. QUEEN. âDare not then To dictate to me farther; I'm a Britonâ I was born free as you, and know my priviledge. Henceforward you shall find that I'm your queen, The guardian and protectress of my subjects; And not your instrument to crush my people: No passive engine for cabals to ply, No tool for factionâI shall henceforth seek For other lights to truth; for righteous monarchs, Justly to judge, with their own eyes should see; To rule o'er freemen, should themselves be free.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Countess of RUTLAND and SOUTHAMPTON. RUTLAND. Is he arriv'd? I shall run mad with joy! Is my Lord come indeed? SOUTHAMPTON. âToo sure, too sure! But Oh! that gulphs, far sunk beneath all fathom, And wide as ocean flows, were now betwixt you! RUTLAND. Now by the sudden transports of my heart, Which bounds, and kindles, spite of thy foreboding, What mean those fears? what ill hath chanc'd, what change, Since late the Queen, like circling providence, Planted her heav'nly guardianship around him, And screen'd him from his envious foes? SOUTHAMPTON. âAlas! His rashness has undone us. His return, Against the appointment of his high commission, And in the palpable and conscious breach Of the Queen's absolute commands; hath forfeited All his proud titles, honours, officesâ Perhaps his precious life. RUTLAND. âO where, where is he? Fly, thou dear friend! stop, intercept, conjure him Quick back to Ireland, ere the blabbing wind Can whisper his arrival. Tho' the world, For one lov'd look, were short and poor of purchase, What's world, or looks, or I, or all to Essex? Fly, thou dear Friendâ SOUTHAMPTON. âAlas! 'tis now too lateâ He's just at handâFame says within this hour He enters London. As I hasted hither, I met the haughty Cecil, envious Raleigh, And treacherous Nottingham in close cabal: From ear to ear death murmur'd, and askance They cast a smile of scorn, and with their eyes Bid me defiance as they pass'd. RUTLAND. âAh friend! I sink beneath my fears, my heart dies in me. I'll to the Queen this moment; fly, fall prostrate, Cling to her royal feet, declare our marriage, Weep, pray, conjure her, yetâif not for Essex, Not for her Rutland's sake to save him, yet Even for the little trembling pledge I bear him, For whose most precious safety she stands charg'd To her whole people. SOUTHAMPTON. âStopâbeware of that, There's not another step 'twixt that and ruin. Timeâprudence checks my tongueâLet it suffice, All other treasons would appear as loyalty To that dread secret! that alone is wanting To seal the doom of EssexâSoft, the Queen! Severe and slow she comes; upon her brow, In mute, but discontented characters, I read her inward tumultâYou had best retire. [Exit Rutland. Enter QUEEN, CECIL, RALEIGH, NOTTINGHAM, and Attendants. QUEEN. Is Essex then return'd? CECIL. âHe is. QUEEN. âWhat hither? To London? 'tis impossibleâ CECIL. Just now arriv'd. QUEEN, âAre law and loyalty but names? Arriv'd against our personal injunctions! 'Tis treason but to think it. CECIL. âWill your Majesty Be pleased to see him? QUEEN. âNo!â CECIL. âShall I then publish Your royal will, forbidding him the court? QUEEN. NeitherâHow dare you, Sir? What, must I still Be guided, nor allow'd my proper judgment? Must every saucy minion call'd to council Straight arrogate controul? and claim to be Dictator to his Queen? SOUTHAMPTON. First, best, and brightest Regent of hearts! whose voluntary throne Rises supreme, amid the blissful tracts Of liberty and reason! at your feet A faithful subject falls. O royal Mistress, I tremble to excuse my valiant friend: He may be rash, impetuous, of a temper Not tun'd to each occasion; for the Earl Has artful foes, who studiously provoke The faults for which they ambush. But that he Is firm, and loyal; that his heart o'erflows With fulness of his Queen; with truth, and faith, And wondrous gratitude; I would stake down The worth of my eternal soul to warrant. Enter a Gentleman, who whispers SOUTHAMPTON. QUEEN. Whate'er Southampton may be as a subject, I see he is a friendâat least to Essex. SOUTHAMPTON. May it please your Majesty, the Earl is come, And waits your royal pleasure. QUEEN. âTell the rebelâ Yet holdâI have better thoughtâYes, I will see himâ But it shall be to sting his haughty soul: Anger would give him consequenceâContempt Is what he least can bear. Give him admittance. Enter ESSEX. ESSEX. Health to the virgin majesty of England! Your servant, your true soldier, Queen of monarchs! For the first time now trembles to approach you, As being here in conscious disobedience Of your dread orders. Yet, when I have shewn That 'twas the last necessity compell'd me (Thanks to the artful malice of my foes) To this now seemingly unduteous act; When I have shewn that no alternative Was left me, but to seem or disobedient, Or bear a traytor's name; I shall rely Upon your majesty's accustom'd grace, Weighing the jealous honour of the soldier, To palliate, if not clear, the subject's fault. âI'm charg'd with guilt, with being false, disloyal, False to my Queen, to England false; could Essex Bear such a charge, and live? Noâswift as thought, And bold as innocence, fearless of danger, Of death, or what is worseâHis Queen's displeasureâ He comes to front his foes; even to the teeth Of malice comes he, to assert his honour, And claim due reparation of his wrongs. QUEEN. Cecil, are those petitions answer'd yet, Which late I gave in charge? CECIL. They are, an't please you. ESSEX. What not a word, a look?ânot one bless'd look Of wonted influence, whose kindly warmth Might chase these envious, and malignant clouds With which your servant is begirt? Nay thenâ My night comes on apaceâI seeâI see The birds of dark and evil omen round me; Cecils, and Raleighs: how they scent their feastâ Sagacious ravens, how they snuff from far The promis'd carcassâBe it soâfor Essex Is but the creature of imperial favour, By his Queen's voice exalted into greatness, And by her breath reduc'd again to nothing. QUEEN. Ha! that's mournfulâ I must not listen to that well known voice; I feel the woman rising in my breast âBut rouse thee, Queen of Britain, be thyself. What, does the traytor still abide our presence? All who have truth, or fealty to their Queen, Follow me straight. [Exeunt all but Essex. ESSEX. Ha! is it then so? What spurn'd, contemn'd, insulted! Not heard, scarce seen; contemn'd! how, how feels that? Contempt and Essex pair'd Enter SOUTHAMPTON. âWhat, one friend left? Then Essex still is rich. SOUTHAMPTON. âMy soul's elect, Be firm! be all yourself! see from the throne Proud Cecil comes, commission'd to discharge Its thunder at thy head. ESSEX. âI see, my brotherâ Never did that Leviathan appear, But as the prophet of some coming wreck; Foretasting ill, and writhing in his nostrils The promise of a tempest. Enter CECIL and RALEIGH. CECIL. âHear ye, Sir, What the unquestion'd majesty of England With gentlest mercy tempering awful justice, By us pronouncesâRobert Earl of Essex, She here divests you of your trusts, and offices; Your dignities of governor of Ireland, Earl marshal, master of the horse, prime general Of all her forces, both by land, and sea; And lord lieutenant of the several counties Of Essex, Hereford, and Westmoreland. ESSEX. Then I'm divestedâwellâwhat more? for these Are but the lightness of a summer's robe, The gauds and outward trappings of her Essex. What farther? CECIL. âThat you instantly depart The Court, and stir no farther than your house, Without an order from the Queen, and council. And lastly, 'tis her pleasure, that you send Your staff by us. ESSEX. âHa! that indeed requires Some pauseâ CECIL. âWhat say you? What may we return In answer to her Majesty? ESSEX. âBut wilt thouâ Wilt thou be sure expressly to deliver What Essex gives in charge? CECIL. âI will most truly. ESSEX. Then tell her, treason never harbour'd yet In bold blunt truths, or openess of action: It seeks close covert in the smiles of courts, Fleers in the cringe, and skulks behind the vizard. Tell herâmy honest Cecil! tell thy mistress, That treason is a statesman, near her throne, Who holds his Queen besieg'd, and calls it guardianship; Who seals th'imperial sense; cuts the dear ties 'Twixt sovereign and subject; fills her church With proselytes to vice, and sets corruption Aloft, even on the seats of injur'd justice: For guilt seeks fellowship, and league with guilt, And vice supports his kindred. CECIL. âI shall remember. SOUTHAMPTON. âTell her too, That while she slumber'd, that arch felon, Cecil Scal'd her high seat, and seized the reins of empire; Thence bids the dews descend, and thunders roll To his direction; sheds her bounties down Where his vile minions for vile ends may prosper: But ever plants the bolt, and deadly blast, Where worth, or wisdom flourishâWretched Britons! Is there a patriot, is there yet a man, Whose blood, whose toils, whose virtues have acquir'd Aught to his country's service; 'tis a crime Set down for capital; a barbed mote, Fretting the eye of envy, and of Cecil. But O! the brave, the valiant never scape him, For cowards still are cruel. CECIL. âWell observ'dâ This I shall tell, and that Southampton said it. RALEIGH. My Lords, in speaking thus, you tax her majesty Of weakness, and injustice both. ESSEX. âI care notâ Suggest whate'er your malice may devise, 'Tis equal all to Essex. CECIL. âMay we then Presume your answer summ'd in this? ESSEX. âYou may. CECIL. You'll not return your staff by us. ESSEX. âI will not. From my Queen's hand did I receive that staff, Nor will I yield it back to any other. CECIL. Fare ye well, lordsâ [Exeunt Cecil and Raleigh SOUTHAMPTON. âNow are they fraught with venom, Which they will strait discharge, with all the force Of spiteful rage, into the royal ear. I must away to counteract their poison. ESSEX. Yes my Southampton, haste, say to the queen That Essex now adjures her by his services, If ever they found favour in her sight, To grant him but a hearing, a short hearing; From her own lips let him receive his doom, To her own hands restore his offices, And he will yield unmurmuring to his fate. SOUTHAMPTON. I sly, my lord, and doubt not yet to gain An interviewâOh! may its end be prosperous. [Exit Southampton. ESSEX. Where now is Essex? Where the late rebuke Of nations, hostile to the peace of Britain? Who spread their lands with rout, their seas with terror!â Deminish'dâshrunkâAs tho' he had never triumph'd; As tho' he ne'er had conquer'd for his country. O hard earn'd glory! long wrought pile of greatness! Are your enchanted works no more than so, A word, and vanish?âNowâWhere are they now? The rushing mobâThe shouting multitudeâ The sweeping levee and the bending circle? All fled, all mute, and lonesome now around me! As tho' I walk'd o'er graves and charnel ground; As tho' I carried famine in one hand, And pestilence in t'other. Enter RUTLAND. RUTLAND. âMy Essex! ESSEX. âRutland! O, my better angel! How has thy presence fill'd this solitude! And like a beam from heaven dispers'd the gloom That overspread my soul. RUTLAND. âI could not bear To think you were so near me, and not rush To snatch one lookâBut I must hasteâ ESSEX. âFear nothing. RUTLAND. We shall be seen. ESSEX. âNo eye is bent this way, No footstep turn'd; for a discarded favourite, Shun'd like the plague, makes every place a desert. RUTLAND. May I then look! indulge my longing eyes? I cannot speak to thee, my heart's too full. Essex! you turn away! ESSEX. âAlas my love What object now is Essex for thy eyes? Stripp'd of his honours, all his glories wither'd, A bare, and sightless trunk! RUTLAND. âO Essex, Essex! Can'st thou think so meanly of thy Rutland, As to believe the gaudy pageantry, The trappings of ambition, ever made thee More lovely in my sight? No, Essex, no, I lov'd thee for thyself. Thy pompous titles, Thy splendid dignities, commands in war, I look'd upon as my worst enemies, Which interpos'd, and held me from my lord. Are they remov'd? then there's no obstacle Between his Rutland, and her soul's elect; And thus she claims him, thus she folds him in, From war, and from ambition, cruel rivals! For all she wedded, all she ever wish'd, Her wealth, her every want, her world is here, And scorns addition. ESSEX. âHeaven make me worthy, Of so much tenderness! yes, I will own Ambition had its charms; but 'twas in hopes To raise my love as high above her sex In dignity, as she transcends in merit: Else had I never barter'd one blest hour Of thy society for what the world, Thro' a proud life of conquest, and dominion, Could yield in absence. RUTLAND. âAnd will you then No longer listen to delusive fame? No more be guided by the witching sires Of wand'ring glory? Homeward wilt thou turn, Where love, and Rutland, have prepared the seat Of humble rapture, and of inward peace? A little empire of serene delights, Of guardian virtues, and observant smiles, All ready, waiting for their lord's arrival. ESSEX. O, my fantastick folly, that could listen To the enchantments of that syren fame! But now the spell is ended; never more Shall vain ambition tempt me to forego My soul's substantial bliss. Adieu false splendours! My rest is fix'd even hereâWe'll find some spot Secluded from the world, like that fair garden, Where first the princely parent of mankind, Blest in his consort's sweet society, Wish'd for no other pleasure: there we'll live, Far from the haunts of men, from vice, and folly; Reign in each other's hearts with mutual sway, The noblest royalty! Be love our treasure, We shall be wond'rous rich! love our ambition, And who exalted like us? RUTLAND. âO my Essex! What a new paradise were there! to know No pangs of parting; see thee every day, And sometimes all the dayâSweet holiday! Peace round my pillow; and my morning sun Cheer'd by thy presence; and thine eyes to speak Love's language; and thy smiles to interfuse The swell of cordial joyâO, my lov'd Essex, That life indeed were blest! ESSEX. âHa! who comes here? Be not alarm'd my love, it is my friend. Enter SOUTHAMTON. Well, my Southamptonâ SOUTHAMPTON. Heavens, what madness this! Sould any eye behold youâAnd the queen Has just enquired for youâFly with speed. RUTLAND. Alas! from what a happy dream of heaven, Hast thou awak'd me! what is human bliss? A moment's meeting, a long age of absence! One rich, and precious drop of cordial joy, Drench'd in a current of insipid time, Or deep affliction. ESSEX. âLight, and life of Essex, From thee be evil far: we soon shall meet To part no more. RUTLAND. FarewelâRemember, Rutland Knows not one happy hour, when thou art from her. [Exit Rutland. SOUTHAMPTON. The queen to my importunate request Has granted you a hearing, be prepar'd: You must command your temper, for believe me 'Tis on the warmth of that, the generous warmth, (Which still accompanies the noblest natures) Your foes rely, to fire the subtle train, Which they have laid to blast your hopes for ever. ESSEX. Well, I will tryâaltho' 'tis wond'rous hard Calmly to bear th'envenom'd shafts of malice; And pois'nous tooth of foul mouth'd calumny! Yet I will tryâBe truth my only weapon, Patience my shield. But no dissimulation Shall with its base alloy, bring down the ore, The pure, rich ore, of which the noble mind By nature's hand is form'd, below truth's standard. No, let me perish, e're one grain of falshood, Infect, and leaven that Integrity Of soul, in which man's dignity consists. Had I the choice to make, I swear by heaven, I should esteem it far more eligible, To fall with honour, than to rise by baseness. [Exeunt. The END of the SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter CECIL and NOTTINGHAM. CECIL. No moreâBright NottinghamâWe strive in vainâ Essex can only be subdu'd by Essex; He stands impregnable to all beside: And if his native pride, and proper passions, Serve not to pull his own destruction on him; He bids for perpetuity in favour. NOTTINGHAM. The queen, I fear, has motives for her favour, Which queens may feel, but not avow; unmark'd Within this hour I stole upon her privacy; Her brow was sunk from royalty; and sad, And desolate her aspect; as of one Betroth'd to loneliness; in whom the pride Of power, and beauty, was no more remember'd. I listen'dâBut her broken accents spoke A voice suppress'd by grief; while down her check Stole the pale tear, which ever as she wip'd, A piteous heir succeeded. CECIL. âI perceive She is much mov'd of late, and prone to starts Of sudden passion, even beyond her temper. NOTTINGHAM. How did she brook the haughty earl's reply To her last message? CECIL. âNever did I see her So stung, so thoroughly enkindledâStraight She issued hasty orders for impeachment; When in the very stroke of instant fate, Southampton came, and with a subtle tale Calm'd all her rage: And now is Essex sent for, To plead to what Southampton boldly stiles The gall of false accusers. NOTTINGHAM. âCurs'd be his tongue! For then the ground we've gain'd will all be lost. CECIL. I see the queen but seeks some thin pretext To cover inclination; some smooth terms Of so't submission, or acknowledg'd error, To reinstate this minion of her fancy, In wonted height of arrogance.âBut see Her closet opensâLet us not appear To pry on her retirements. NOTTINGHAM. âYou withdraw, I'll wait within her call. [Exit Cecil. Enter QUEEN. QUEEN. The proud, insensible, ungrateful wretch! The thankless, kindless, faithless, barbarous Essex! False to his loving queen, his friend, his patron; False to hisâHold thee there, for I will tear him From my fond bosom, tho' the vital drops Of my sad heart should follow,âQueen of Britain To what art thou reduc'd? with not one friend; Forlorn, and desolate, amidst a realm, Whom as a parent bird, with hov'ring wings Thy daily love has gathered in from danger, And foster'd with thy life,âHa! Nottingham! I thought I had been alone.â NOTTINGHAM. âPardon a duty Perhaps too forwardâAh, my royal mistress! All is not wellâUpon my knees I begâ Somewhat hangs heavy on your mind, or haply Your precious health's in danger. QUEEN. Rise, my Nottinghamâ I am in health, and thank thy tenderness; Only a little troubled that my people Grow weary of my love: I have reign'd long; Such is the nature of inconstant man, The purest ore of happiness below, Without variety, will lose its value; Whilst novelty can give the vilest dross Both stamp and currency. Prithee my friend, What say the people to this haughty man, And his late conduct? NOTTINGHAM. âPlease your majesty, They seem to blame him highly. QUEEN. âBlame him, say'st thou? NOTTINGHAM. Indeed it was not well. QUEEN. âNot wellâThe Traytor! And is that all? Come, come, speak plainly to me. Is it thus tamely that my subjects see This daring insult to my crown? Or warm'd With duteous zeal, and loyal indignation, Vent freely their reproaches? NOTTINGHAM. âThus commanded, I shall without disguise speak what I've heard Of this imperious soldier. QUEEN. âAye, pray doâ Be plainâWhat says the world of me, and Essex? NOTTINGHAM. Of you they never speak, but in a prayer Of due thanksgiving, and of wishes breath'd As incense up to heaven, for length of life, And days of happy omen. QUEEN. âWell, proceedâ Of Essex thenâ NOTTINGHAM. âOf him they utter terms Of due reproach, and plenteous imprecation. His popularity, they give to pride, That cringes to be courted; his beneficence To niggard bribes for flattery; his high courage To bear-like brutal rashness; his atchievements To a mean fondness for the blab of fame: And all his acts stil'd patriot, all his labours, His risques, his wounds, his conquests for his country; To close and treacherous plottings on her rights, And sacred liberties.âFor he's ambitious, Dark, dreadful, and aspiring, as the fiend Who first rais'd war in heaven, and tumbling thence Unpeopled Paradise; and so they wish The fall of Essex may be quick, andâ QUEEN. âHoldâ No moreâThou hast rail'd thyself quite out of breath. In thee 'tis base, 'tis barbarous insolence To echo thus the vileness of the rabble. Unhappy Essex! truly hast thou serv'd A false base world, and now hast none to friend, Save her thou hast offended. NOTTINGHAM. âPlease your majesty Your own express commandâ QUEEN. âAway, awayâ Thou see'st thy queen, misfortune, and the world All bent against one man, and yet can'st find Within that ruthless and obdurate breast, No room for pity. NOTTINGHAM. âMadam, I hopeâ QUEEN. Well, well, no more of itâ 'Tis past, and I forgiveâSend Rutland hither. [Exit Nottingham. What has my passion done? Perhaps unfolded The very secret it attempts to cover; What I would hide from thought. Why stands my soul Upon the watch to listen and enquire Tydings, which most it dreads to learn, the faults, And errors of my Essex? Why my heart, Why art thou prone to utter terms of blame Against the cruel troubles of thy quiet? Yet can'st not bear the slightest censure drop'd From any other Tongue, as tho' all crimes Against myself were light, and what is spoke Against my Essex, stood alone for treason. Enter RUTLAND. My Rutland, I did send for thee my girl; I have observ'd that thou art sad of late. Why are thy lovely eyes depress'd with sorrow? Can I do aught that may dispel the cloud, That envious cloud, which hangs upon thy beauties, And robs me of my friend? RUTLAND. âAh, queen of grace! And heavenly goodness! you oppress your servant, With this excess of condescension. QUEEN. âWhyâ I love thee well, my Rutland, well, and warmly; Trust me I do.âInjurious Nottingham, Hath held displeasing conversation with me, Touching my lord of Essex; insomuch That I did send her from my sight in anger. RUTLAND. Ha! that dear name, starts every pulse within me! QUEEN. Thou blushest, Rutland. RUTLAND. âAt the wond'rous grace, The wond'rous goodness of my queen. QUEEN. âIndeed Thou'rt of a grateful nature, ever sweet, And kindly temper'd. Come then to my Bosom, And share its warmest love.âTell me, my Rutland, Is it not pity that so brave a man, So form'd for gallant acts, and upright honour, That Essex should be false, should prove a traytor? And goaded by ambition, should attempt The sceptre of his queen; to whom he owes A countless debt of favours; by whom raised Beyond a subject's state, he proudly now Would grasp the crown, which seems within his reach. RUTLAND. It cannot be, it is impossible; The soul of Essex is above such baseness, Such black ingratitude. Ah! royal mistress! Had you but heard him, on the breath of praise Lift up the exalted name of England's queen, As I have often heard him!â QUEEN. âSay'st thou Rutland, Hast thou heard Essex talk of me? RUTLAND. âOf you? He owns no other theme. In courts I grant He is no minion, but a soldier bold, And jealous of his honour: but when his truth Is free to heaven, and honest ears, 'tis then He vents the swell of gratitude, and tunes His words to loyalty, his voice to love. Your acts, your laws, your virtues, and your beauties, Your every excellence of mind and person, Vary his numbers thro' a ceaseless round Of untir'd praise; and all is of his mistress, And all of England's virgin majesty, And all is full of you. QUEEN. âIndeed my Rutland, I would fain hope that Essex still is honest: But then he's so ungovern'd, rash, so headstrong, Nor law, nor duty hold him: I do fear, I greatly fear, with safety to my fame, I may no more protect him. RUTLAND. âNot protect him! By the bright star of mercy in your soul, That shines on the distrestâOh say you not That he is honest? Yes he still is loyal, Faithful, and firm: the virgin light of heaven E're yet it mingles with our grosser elements, Is not more pure. O will you not remember His worth, his truth, his toils, and his atchievements? A wond'rous story all! high deeds of fame That gird the crown of England's queen with glory. His valour too! his valour royal madam! It foils the heroes of romance: a name So formidable to the foes of Britain, It spares our English host, and of itself Discomfits armies. QUEEN. âHa! this heat is more Than friendship's warmth; 'tis from a stronger fireâ She loves himâAye, 'tis soâAnd is herself Too lovely! wretched chance!âWhat have I done? Just conjur'd up a second storm to wreck me. Leave me.â [Exit Rutland. Enter CECIL, RALEIGH, NOTTINGHAM, &amp;c. CECIL. May it please your majesty, my lord of Essex, Return'd by your command, entreats admittance. QUEEN. âLet him appear. Now queen of Britain, now support thy state! Now guard thy treacherous heart, but for this once, Against its dear, its insolent controuler, And fear no future foeâCome hither Nottingham. Enter ESSEX, and SOUTHAMPTON. ESSEX. Before I plead my cause, permit me thus, Most gracious mistress, thus in due prostration, To pay my grateful thanks, for this last favour In granting me a hearing; that once ended, To my queen's justice I submit my life, And what is dearer to me far, my honour: Implicity to your tribunal bow, Humbly prepar'd, and equally resign'd To either sentence. QUEEN. My lords, what suppliant's this? Can this be he, Our late imperious subject? He, who holds A staff of independence, and a state That scorns to yield to our supremacy? O, these are gallant acts! and well become The boasted name of our all conquering Essex! Who bravely turns his courage on his queen; But where his duty calls him to the combat, Can coolly condescend to terms of peace, And gentle treaty. ESSEX. âIs it come to this? To be a term of ridicule, and mockery, Where most I would be priz'd? cast by my Queen To public scorn, and mean contempt?âThen Essexâ Then art thou fallen indeed! Why this, my mistress? Are there not chains, and dungeons; blocks, and axes? These had been fitter instruments of royalty, And done a nobler justice on your soldierâ I think your majesty was pleas'd to speak Touching some treaty, as a charge against me Of something criminal. QUEEN. âYes, with Tyrone, Your parley; and your truceâDischarge those stains, Your covert articles with England's rebels. ESSEX. Alas, how soon pretences may be found To make the envy'd fallâOf treatyâYesâ I do avow it. Am not I your general? Impower'd for war, for peace, to treat, to fight, Levy, disband, to punish, and to pardon. QUEEN. And should the mighty Essex have confin'd These powers to peace alone, even when rebellion Led forth his hosts, and dar'd him to the combat? Whilst heâ ESSEX. âShrunk like a cowardâIs't not so? Ha! madam! Essex, and cowardice!âlet those stand forth Who dar'd to match themâAsk your ministers Why they witheld my army from the North, By keeping back my due recruits, and subsidies. QUEEN. You grow too boldâYou are call'd here to plead, Not to impeachâYour army was sufficient. ESSEX. No, royal madam, it was not sufficient To war with heaven, to fight against Omnipotence! It was consum'd with fevers, and diseases; For Essex could have fear'd no other foe. There's not a casuist in Rome's artful school, Or Cecil's darker council, who can mark The slightest lapse of duty in your servant; And shall he not retaliate, shall he not Unwind the subtle clue, which leads his Queen To cruel sarcasm, and unjust resentment. QUEEN. Unjust, and cruel! holdâno moreâI charge you! ESSEX. Not speak, not speak! madam, I am your subject; The world contains not one more duteous; yet Here I must not be silentâThoughts to slaves,â But speech to BritonsâYes I will assert it, The freedom of my native land, tho' death Did cross me to the teethâA criminal debar'd His priviledge to plead! 'tis evident My life's conspir'd, my glories all traduc'd; These bosom'd snakes, and ear-informing sycophants Gape for my plenteous heirship; even my Queen Foredooms her subject, and gives up her soldier, A sacrifice to faction. QUEEN. Oh, he'll be lost!âUndo himself, and me! What, I conspire, traduce, foredoom thy sentence! Know, thou proud wretch, thou hast no other friend: Thou who art so observant! who didst spurn My orders, letters, messagesâBut hold, Beware how thou dost shake my wrongs too much, Lest they fall thick, and heavy on thy head. Rash fool, and undiscerning;âYet thus far I do forgive thee; pardon thee that life, I did conspireâBut for thy officesâ ESSEX. âI throw them at your feetâand proud indeed To be acquitted of all debt to majesty! Now give them up to cowards, courtiers, parasites; And dub them champions; in whose doughty guardianship Your Essex can't be miss'd; whilst he is banish'd, And bears no mark of royal gratitude, But wounds for toils, for dangers ignominy, And sufferings for allegiance: haply sent To desarts, or to herd with savagesâ There he may find more equity, and honour, Than in the faith of princes. SOUTHAMPTON. âMy lord, my lord! Recall your temper. QUEEN. The audacious traytor! ESSEX. âTraytor! ha, traytor! yes, because I fenc'd Your throne; this breast, this scarr'd breast still its bulwark; For covering England with my spreading laurels, Whilst your safe subjects slept beneath the shade; For humbling Spain, your proud, and dreaded rival, And wafting all their India to your Thames; For building up the fame of England's Queen So high, it flames a beacon to the world. Said I your fame? Your lifeâyour lifeâkind mistress! For saving that, and cutting bold Northumberland, And hostile Westmoreland, short by the head: This did the faithless, and degraded Essexâ But I'll remove the traytor from your sight. QUEEN. Hold, Sirâ Go not without rewardâ [Strikes him. ESSEX. Death! hell! from whence? my Queenâ [Half draws his sword. QUEEN. âWhat would the villain? Dares he attempt my life? ESSEX. âRash woman! Were you a man, you durst notâYour hot father, Bold Harry, durst not risque it.âWhat talk I Of Harries? not young Ammon, as whose nod The servile Earth fell prostrate, had surviv'd To boast this desperate deed. QUEEN. May the mark flick like Cain's, for thy rebellion! Thou madding wretch, untam'd, and dangerous ever. I give thee up I will no more against Thy own outrageous folly, strive to save thee. Like thy last hopes, I leave thee to the stings Of guilt and desperationânow cast forth, Unpitied and unblest of earth, and heaven, And thy too partial queen. [Exeunt all but Essex and Southampton. SOUTHAMPTON. What have you done? ruin'd yourself and friends By your high carriage.âFly, my lord, yet fly, Follow the Queen, intreat, implore her pardon. ESSEX. Away!âThe spot of infamy is on me!â The blow has fir'd my soul, and all within, Is deafning uproarâNever 'till this hour Was Essex fit for treasons, cruel joys, And glutting horrors! Get thee hence, Southampton, For I'm the tumbling of a thousand towers, Ruins that threaten far, to involve all Who sap, or prop, within a like perdition. SOUTHAMPTON. I fear no ruin, when my friend's in danger; If thou must fall, thou shalt not fall alone: Southampton never will forsake his Essex, But share his adverse, as his prosperous fortune. Away then, let us fly this dang'rous place. ESSEX. Aye, there thou say'st, my friend, avoid all courts, The bane of native dignity, and greatness. But shall it be? Shall drones, and wasps alone Devour the treasur'd sweets of all the land, And drive the bees from their long-labour'd mansion? Noâlet us purge, or overturn the hiveâ There yet is feelingâyet is fire in England!â I'll to the streets, the city, wake, alarm, And kindle every spark of slumb'ring virtue: Rouze ev'ry Briton to his country's call, And in her freedom stand, or perish in her fall. [Exeunt. The END of the THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter severally CECIL and NOTTINGHAM. NOTTINGHAM. Ha! Cecilâwellâand is he, is he taken? CECIL. Joy! joy! my Nottinghamâhe's sunk for ever, Caught in the very act of broad rebellion: Essex is fall'n, no more to rise. No more Shall politicians set the gins of state, Or nets of circumvention; for the lion, In his blind rage has rush'd upon the toil, Where he may roar, and tear, and gnash in vain, But never shall get free. NOTTINGHAM. Oh, it o'erjoys me, Feeds the keen hunger of my vengeful soul, To see this pride, this insolence of manhood, This scorner hurl'd down from his dazzling height; To see him drop with all his train of glory, And vanish in the dustâHa! Cecil. CECIL. âHold, The Queen,âif possible conceal your transport. Enter QUEEN and Attendants. QUEEN. What is he crush'd? This trampler on authority; âThe lofty one! and is he fall'n? CECIL. He isâ Thanks to the sacred power who guards your majesty! QUEEN. Then he is humbled at the lastâThis proud one! The manner of it Cecil? CECIL. âWhen the earl Withdrew from court, all mad, and chaf'd with passion, He hurried to his house; and severally Summoned the friends in whom he most confided. A num'rous band they were of lawless spirits, Whose joy is riot, and whose hopes take fire From the wild spark of dazling novelty, And gainful revolution. In their council It was resolved, Southampton should attend To form the numbers who were yet expected; While the arch rebel march'd, as he did boast, To raise the city. QUEEN. âWhat my faithful citizens! Could he hope that? CECIL. âHe did; and as he pass'd, The vulgar, ever eager of events, Pour'd in from every side, and swell'd the concourse. To right, to left he bended, and as one Train'd to the Areopagus of old, Or Rome's prevailing rostrum, with smooth act Of mute emotion, thro' the distant eye, He sought to reach the heart. To all around, His voice now sunk, now rais'd to exclamation, Appealing to the wisdom of the mob, Against state policy; much did he talk Of crowns begirt with evil counsellors; Of trust misplac'dâGood monarch's, but misled By wicked ministersâStale topicks all; Yet these will gloss, and colour every cause, While man shall kick at governmentâHe then Descended to himself; spoke piteously Of suff'ring virtue; number'd o'er his wrongs, And counted every scar; the time, the place, The peril too of each; all borne he said For them, and for their Children: then he wept, And they wept too, soft souls! as tho' each gash Had bled anew. QUEEN. âAlas! I wonder not, That sight had melted even his queen to pity. Proceedâ CECIL. The earl perceiving in their eye The work of passionâStraight he cry'd, arm, arm! For truth, for liberty! arm ye my friends! Off with your galling riders! down oppression! If not for Essex, for your selves, your sons, Your latest issue! what are you to feel, If me they spare not? what must 'fall the fold, When their great guardian's murder'd?âHere he paus'd: But none reply'd; for tho' his mournful story Had filled their hearts with sorrow, yet the close Bore such a frightful face of dangerous treason, That terror soon succeededâOne slunk off, Another follow'd; 'till all soft and silent, Like snow they melted from his side. QUEEN. âHow then? How look'd the rebel left alone? CECIL. âAt once Fear, guilt, and disappointment, rush'd upon him; Amaz'd he hasten'd where his barge attended, And reach'd his house by water, at the time When your brave troops had forc'd the outward gate, And made Southampton, and his faction pris'ners: Then might you see the indignant rebel cast A look of desperation at high heaven, As one renouncing hope; forth flew his sword. As he would rush on death; but sore begirt At length he yielded to ignoble hands, And clos'd the tale of Essex. QUEEN. âI once hop'd His morning sun, that brightned as he rose, Might also set with equal rays of honour. Where is the earl? CECIL. âUnder a sufficient guard In order for his sending to the Tower. QUEEN. Ha! order'd to the Tower, whose orders, sir? CECIL. Madam, the earls are yet without. QUEEN. â'Tis wellâ, To prison with SouthamptonâBut for Essex, I'll see him e'er he goes: let him appearâ And all withdraw. [Exeunt all but the queen. âHeavens! what a scene is this? How shall I bear it? Be compos'd my heart!â Can that be Essex?âThe distrest, the fall'n, The forlorn Essex!âWhat a state hears! Still undiminish'd, still himselfâAway With pomp, and borrow'd lustre then; true greatness Shall build a seat of lovelier majesty, With Essex, and misfortune. Enter ESSEX. Essex is not thus we should have metâ You ought to know it is notâI did hopeâ But 'tis no matterâYou may speak, my lord, If you have ought to offer. ESSEX. Nothing, madam. QUEEN. 'Tis well, and yetâperhaps 'twere better, sir, You'd think againâOut meetings shan't be frequent. ESSEX. It might have been your majesty's good pleasure To spare ev'n thisâI sought it not. QUEEN. âI know it Ungrateful man, I know itâBut I hold No longer parley with theeâIt is finish'dâ Thou everlasting troubler of my quiet, Soon, soon we shall be both at peace. ESSEX. âEnoughâ I have my death, and you your wishâ QUEEN. âI Essex! I wish thy death! you knowâBut let me calmly Demand of thee, what was it that could tempt thee, To court, invite, and pull down on thine head A ruin so reluctant? To o'erbear All law, all order? ESSEX. âIs that yet to learn? When every packet brought me fresh advices Of the malicious plottings of my foes; Yet I could o'erlook that, secure in innocence, Could wait my time: but when I found my Queen Had listen'd to their tales; under her hand Confirm'd, soon as I saw that doubts and jealousies Were deeply rootedâI no longer paus'dâ Law, order, even your own injunctions then Were but as chaff before the wind; I flew To see with my own eyes if it were true, That I had lost your favourâThat once gone, The animating soul of all my hopes, The end of all my thoughts, and all my actions; The world had nothing in it worth my care, And life or death were equally indifferent. QUEEN. Was that the motive? why was not I inform'd? ESSEX. Inform'd! which way? Was I once heard, regarded? When prostrate I implor'd my Queen to hear me, Was she not cold, and deaf, as thawless ice, Or ears of adamant?âRejected, spurn'd, Cast to the rav'ning jaws of my pursuers, Like the lone pard, I was at length compell'd To turn upon my hunters. But had Essex, Had Essex been the traytor he is deem'd, He had not singly fac'd a host of foes, But led up troops, inur'd to victory Beneath his banner, to a man prepar'd To fight, or fall for Essex. QUEEN. âThere is some weight In that, and I would fain believe your motive Was such as you declareâYet, Essex, Essex! Oh thy rash pride! if thou had'st condescended But to the light appearance of reproof, From thy kind Queenâ ESSEX. âAppearance, Madam? QUEEN. âYesâ And when I would have colour'd to the world Substantial favour, with a shew of chidingâ ESSEX. A shew of chiding!âO my gracious mistress, Did you not hate me? Did you not indeed Abhor, detest your soldier? QUEEN. âNo, too wellâ Too well I lov'd thee, proud, unbending man! Could I have hated thee, I had been happy. ESSEX. Ha! Lightning blast me first! my Queen in tears! QUEEN. Away thou hot, thou undiscerning Essex! Could'st thou not trust a friendship, that had stood Firm as th'irrevocable doom of fate, Against thy enemies? their daily murmurs, All their loud plaints, petitions, and impeachments Dash'd back with indignation on the front Of thy accusersâMight not such a friend Expect some small concession? Did'st thou grant it? Did'st thou not stand in haughty opposition? Fly to the city, levy cruel war Against thy Queen, against thy kind protector? Who could almost have pray'd for thy success, Altho' her crown, altho' her life perhaps, Had been the barbarous forfeit. ESSEX. âO my mistress! You have undone meâYour o'erpow'ring goodness Has crush'd my heartâI see my folly now, My crime broad staring in my faceâO wretch, Blind wretch!âYet let me not be charg'd Beyond my proper guiltâThe weight of that Alone will overwhelm me. It was pride, Unparallel'd presumption, arrogance Beyond exampleâBut your crown!âYour life! To attempt thoseâO noâIn all the wilds Of frenzy, such a thought could never enter This loyal bosom. QUEEN. âFain would I believeâ ESSEX. Believe! ah, royal madam, can you doubt it? By the dread secrets of that unknown world, To which your servant hastens, noâHis thoughts Ne'er aim'd at such damnationâThenâEven then When I did think your hatred of your Essex Rose to a hostile loathingâI had then Laid down my life to purchase to my Queen, Access of days, and honour. QUEEN. âO! no moreâ Enough, my soldierâI have been to blame; We both have err'd, mistaking each the other. Fatal mistake! how can it be repair'd? What's to be done?â ESSEX. âNothing for me, my frenzy Has borne me far beyond the bounds, beyond The reach of mercy: I must dieâ Your fame, your peace, your future welfare, all Demand this sacrifice, and I will go A willing victim; 'tis the only way To expiate my crime. Yet e're I fall Thus on my knee let me imploreâ QUEEN. âRise Essex, I cannot see you thus. ESSEX. âPermit me, madam! The hour's at hand, when all you see of Essex, Shall be restor'd to dust; say, my blest mistress, Say, if my blood may wash my stains away? Will you then drop your heavenly pardon down Upon the guilt, and folly of your Essex? And when forgot by others, may he hope To find some place within his Queen's remembrance? QUEEN. I cannot speak to thisâdown swelling heart! May heaven bestow on both, a pardon free And full, as that which now I grant to thee. Can Essex too forgive his Queen the blow, Her rashness gave him. ESSEX. â'Tis too much?âToo much This condescension! 'tis a cruel goodness, It pierces to my soul. QUEEN. âOur time is shortâ Soon will the lords, your judges be assembled For life, or deathâYou stand upon the brink! I fearâI would do muchâ'Tis true my fame Is dearâThe pleasure of my people too, 'Tis peril unto bothâYet EssexâYetâ I cannot see thee lostâHere is my gageâ Take it, and with it take my royal word, That whensoever you return this ring, Whate'er be your request, it shall be granted, To my crown's value. ESSEX. âOn my knee I take itâ A radiant token, like the showery bow, When first the patriarch hail'd it in the heavens; Bless'd envoy of divinity appear'd, And grace to wayward man! QUEEN. Farewel!âWho waits? Enter Lieutenant of the Tower. There take your pris'ner hence, and guard him safe, Until his hour of trial. [Exeunt ESSEX and Lieutenant. âNow I feel My heart more easy, all may yet be well. Enter RUTLAND and Ladies. RUTLAND. Where is my Queen?âWhere is my royal mistress? Yet holdâRecall your sentenceâAt your feet I throw myself for mercyâMercy! QUEEN. Ha!âWhat do'st thou mean? RUTLAND. âO! never will I rise, But take root, the very plant of sorrow, 'Till you will hear, and grant; 'till I've implor'd, Obtain'd my full petition. QUEEN. âThis is frenzy! Thou do'st amaze me RutlandâRise. QUEEN. âNo, no. Thus will I kneel, and weep, hold for ever; Cling to your feet, incumber all your steps, For pityâ'Till you do relentâFor pardon! Pity, and pardon!â QUEEN. Quick, declare your meaning. RUTLAND. I fearâAnd yet I mustâThe worst is silenceâ Will you then promise?âWill you then prepare?â It is a story that may start your patience. My lordâYour servantâYour ill-fated soldierâ Your EssexâSave himâSave him! QUEEN. âHa! what said'st thou? O my prophetic soul!âIs't thy concern? How? Whereby? RUTLAND. âSave him! Save my lost lordâYour EssexâSave his life, And save the life of RutlandâO! he isâ He isâmy husbandâ QUEEN. âHeavens! thy husband! RUTLAND. âYes:â A dear, a fatal name it isâI see it, By the dread spark that quickens in your eye, We were in secret married, a short while Before my hapless lord set out for Ireland, On his last expedition. QUEEN. âSerpents! vipers! My curse it is to bosom such alone! And all my fost'rings, all my nourishments, Are paid me back in poisonâMarried! married! Then thou art wedded to thy death. RUTLAND. âMy death! Alas! that's nothing; would my death appease youâ His life is all I askâO royal madam! You cannot knowâYou never had a husband; You cannot feel how dreadful are the terrors, The agonizing pangs of a fond wife, Who fears to lose the husband of her heart, Her first, her only love! QUEEN. âO! I am rack'd! Off, off! I say with those detested hands! RUTLAND. I will not, cannotâE're you cast me from you, Think, feel, how I am tornâMy throbbing heart, My frantic pulses, how they start, and beat, To break their limitsâMy affrighted infant Who know no guilt, yet trembles at your fury, And starts, as conscious of his father's danger. QUEEN. Quick, tear her from meâDrag her from my sightâ RUTLAND. O if you are woman, born of womanâFirst Say but that he shall liveâShall he not live? My love, my Essex, my life's lord. QUEEN. Why am not I obey'd?âHenceâTear her henceâ RUTLAND. Oh, these inhumane creatures!âI'm too weak, My last of strength forsakes me, and I sink Into despair's deep gulph. QUEEN. âBe that thy portion! May comfort never find thee! may thy offspring, If it should see the light, prove a fresh source Of torment to theeâMay we never meet! Be our appointments wide as pole from pole, Nor let that hated aspect shock me more. [Exit Queen. RUTLAND. Yet stay, returnâAnd Rutland shall assist To frame new curses on herselfâShe's goneâ His doom is seal'dâHe diesâThen welcome all, The blackest plagues, that ever clung to misery! May woes, on woes be heap'd, 'till the full measure O'erwhelm my soul, and crush me into rest. [Exit. The END of the FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, the Tower. CECIL, and Lieutenant of the Tower. CECIL. If you regard your present place, or hope For any future favour, to a moment you will Observe my orders. LIEUTENANT. Most religiously. Enter NOTTINGHAM. NOTTINGHAM. Sir, by her Majesty's command, I bring A message to my lord of Essex. LIEUTENANT. âMadam, I shall acquaint my lord. LIEUTENANT. âHow's this, my Nottingham? To Essex from the Queen, and you the messenger? Is she not yet resolved? NOTTINGHAM. âNot fix'd a moment. First when she heard the traytor was condemn'd, She started, and her colour turn'd to milk; Then blushing, scarlet deep, she strove to hide Her inward tumult; thank'd the lords his judges, And bad that execution should be speedy. But pausing said, upon a farther thought, She'd wait to hear if yet the criminal Had aught to offerâThen retir'd, and pass'd An hour in privateâSent in haste to call me; Bid me draw near, look'd wistfully upon me, And will'd me to convey her last of messages, To ruin'd EssexâLet him know, said she, I can no longer bar the pressing claims Of justice on himâYet if he has reasons That are of weight to stay his execution, Let him deliver them by youâThen blush'd; Breath'd a short sigh, and pressing close my hand, Enjoin'd me to be secret, and return With speed and privacy, whatever Essex Should give in answer. CECIL. âHa! this covert message, I like it notâWould heaven the deed were done! Aye thenâbut now 'tis doubtful working all, And curs'd suspension. NOTTINGHAM. âCecil, do not fear, But I shall render a well-pleasing issue Of this same interview with my beloved! CECIL. There rest my hopes; state policy already Hath spent its shafts, and waits the master stroke From your superior genius. I will hence With Raleigh to the Queen, and strive to fix Her wavering mind. [Exit Cecil. NOTTINGHAM. Come now revenge, thou idol Of slighted woman!âCome, and steel my breast Against all sense of pity, or remorse. Enter ESSEX. ESSEX. Fair visitant, to whom may Essex stand Indebted for this grace? NOTTINGHAM. âChiefly, my lord, To the Queen's majesty; and some small matter To one who loving well, tho' most unhappily, Has not yet learn'd entirely to erase The fond impression. ESSEX. âYour reproof is gentleâ Were Rutland to be born, I must admit All hearts had then been Nottingham's. NOTTINGHAM. âYour pardonâ No more of hearts I prayâbut for your friendship, I will dispute it even with her who claims Possession of your heartâThe Queen, my lord, Commends the value of her pity to you; And kindly asks if you have ought to offer In mitigation of your sentence? ESSEX. Nothing. NOTTINGHAM. Some light exception, touching law, or form; Apparent malice in the prosecution; Error of judgmentâbut the slightest hinge, Whereon to hang her mercy. ESSEX. âNot the slightestâ Tell her, most fair, and charitable messenger, My course of tryal has been free and equal; I stand self-censur'd in my guiltiness: And mercyâwhat in mercy may ensue, Is all her own, unpleaded. NOTTINGHAM. âHow, my lord, No more than so? this cannot, must not be. The appointed time is on you; this short hour May seal your doomâO let me beg, implore you, As if for my own life, to use the means Are left you to preserve yourself, your friendâ Say, have you not a farther plea? you hesitateâ A farther cause for hope?âYou have, I know itâ Intrust me with it; by yon heaven I swear, I will not leave the Queen 'till she has granted My utmost wish. ESSEX. âI have not merited This kind concern; but yet your generous warmth Demands my confidence. Behold this signet! It is a talisman, and bears a charm, By royal breath infus'd, of pow'r to save Ev'n from the jaws of death. NOTTINGHAM. âO let me catch it That I may flyâ ESSEX. Hold, generous fair one! first Hear my requestâpresent this to the Queen From dying EssexâSay her dying Essex Adjures her by the virtue of this ring, To save his friend, to spare Southampton's life, And he shall fall content. NOTTINGHAM. O stint not thus The royal bountyâDo not circumscribe The bounds of mercyâBy the same request, By the same breath, a life more precious far May be preserv'dâit mustâit shall. ESSEX. âI dare not Urge such a suitâYet if my gracious mistress Still thinks me worth preserving, I am not. So weary of the world, but I would take The boon with grateful heart, and live to thank her. But O, be sure you urge my other suit; Save my Southampton's life, let him not fall A victim to my crimesâAlas! he knows No guilt, but friendship. So may conscious peace Sweeten your days, and brighten your last moments. [Exit Essex. NOTTINGHAM. Now he is mine! at least in death my own, For ever seal'd; tho' not for love's light rapture, For hatred, full as joyousâdeeper far, And more enduring. Now to take him sudden, When the full tide returning fraught with hope, Lifts him elateâTo plunge him down at once To the eternal bottomâThis, aye this Alone can satiateâ'Tis the luxury Of eager-ey'd revenge. The Queenâno matterâ I am prepar'dâbe but my vengeance safe, And for the rest, events are equal all. Enter the QUEEN. QUEEN. Well, my dear Nottingham, hast seen the earl? NOTTINGHAM. Madam, I have. QUEEN. I could not be at peace within my palace, For crowds that urg'd petitions in his favour. Well, and what pass'd? NOTTINGHAM. Madamâ QUEEN. Sayâ NOTTINGHAM. I wishâ QUEEN. MadamâI wishâWhat mean'st thou? NOTTINGHAM. I wish your majesty had spar'd your servant This single office. QUEEN. Why?â NOTTINGHAM. âI had not been The unwelcome bearer of ungrateful tydings. QUEEN. Inform me quickâungrateful tydings say'st thou? NOTTINGHAM. O, on my knees I beg, my royal mistress, You would enquire no farther. QUEEN. Thou dost amaze me! NOTTINGHAM. You lately held me for an enemy To this brave man, and still may think me apt To misinterpretâ QUEEN. No, I will believe thee. NOTTINGHAM. He's here at handâYour majesty in person May now inform yourselfâ QUEEN. No more, I charge youâ Be full, and speedyâGive me up the whole Of what has pass'd. NOTTINGHAM. I must obey you thenâ And yet I fearâWhen first the earl appear'd He wore a kind of haughty discontent, That seem'd to mock misfortune; scarce he deign'd To note that I was present. QUEEN. âWhat, so high? NOTTINGHAM. Yet not ungraceful. Greatly I deplor'd The precipice to which misdeeming error, Or accident had led himâbid him yet Not to despondâfor much was in the power Of royal pityâThen I minded him Of your past favoursâAll his honours, offices, Your late support against his powerful foes, And this last act of your divine compassion, That would not let him finally be lost, But sent your special servant to concert The means of safety to him. QUEEN. âThen he did melt. NOTTINGHAM. Let me stop hereâfor sure such height of pride, In one of less exalted qualities, Were not to be endur'dâStill as I spoke, He look'd, and mov'd, and turn'd, and chang'd impatient; Favours! he cry'd, what favours? posts of danger, And empty titles for essential service: Yesâshe has well avow'd her grace to Essex, In all her public scoffs, and open insults, Laid as a subtle train to fire my temper To acts obnoxious to the law; and then Her jury of pack'd peers, and this smooth message To lull me to the last. QUEEN. Hold, Nottinghamâ O, he's the most accurs'd for deep ingratitude, That e'er prov'd false to friendshipâTell me, Nottingham, I can no longer wait the tedious prefaceâ Say, did he claim no mercy at our hands? NOTTINGHAM. Not any, madam. QUEEN. Spoke he of no pledge? No obligation that I had to save him? NOTTINGHAM. No, on my honour. QUEEN. âBy thy hopes of mercy, Answer as at the last tremendous barâ No pledge, no token, sent he not a ring? Look at me, and reply; did he not send A ring in answer? NOTTINGHAM. You amaze me, madam! I'm quite to seek in thisâWhat ring? what token? Had you but told me, had your majesty Once hinted such a thing, I had requir'd it. QUEEN. O, I am choak'd! he pulls his own destruction In his blind fury on himself. NOTTINGHAM. Alas, Tokens of mercy! he disclaim'd the offer: He said, he wou'd no more of royal mercy! Such as was shewn to Rutland, to his wife; As tho' the British breed of noble bloods, Were slaves for pride to spurn. QUEEN. No more, no moreâ I'm all on fireâThis fever of the blood, It thirsts to death!âWho waits? Enter CECIL and RALEIGH. My lords, See speedy execution done on Essexâ I have determined not to quit the Tower, While he is master of his headâLord Cecil, Do you and Raleigh see it done. [Exeunt Queen and Nottingham. RALEIGH. Think you, my lord, how long a woman's will, Altho' the first, and foremost of her sex, May hold its purpose? CECIL. If a fav'rite point Mayhap, an hour or so; therefore the half Shall now suffice us RaleighâWho attends? Enter an Officer. Bid the lieutenant have his pris'ners ready. [Exit Officer. Now we may hope for sunny days in England, When this all-covering cloud is overpast; Whose greatness did imbibe the beams of majesty, Nor suffer'd ought to pass but by transmission Thro' its own radiant skirts. Enter Lieutenant of the Tower, with ESSEX and SOUTHAMPTON guarded. CECIL. My lord of Essex, We bring an order for your Execution. I have a christian's hope you stand prepar'd; For even a portion of the present hour Must be your last of life. ESSEX. Ha! short indeed, For infinite intendments! 'tis thy will O heaven! collect me to it: give me strength To face this king of terrorsâfill my breast With hope, and purest faith, that on the block I may lye down, as on the plaintless bed Of sleeping infancy. Thanks, gracious heaven! I feel my granted prayer; and a new vigour Springs in my breast!âI now can smile at death. But oh, my friend! no pardon yet arriv'd! Can the Queen falsify her word? SOUTHAMPTON. Come, Essexâ Let us now leave a lesson to our foes, How men should die. ESSEX. Were I alone to suffer, I think I should not give them cause to scorn me. But oh! 'tis hereâ A weight of lead on my aspiring spirit, That I have rent the virtues of Southampton Untimely from the world. SOUTHAMPTON. Be witness heaven! The dearest wish Southampton's soul could form, Would be to live for ever with his Essex: The next, thus join'd to lie in death together. Enter Lieutenant of the Tower. LIEUTENANT. My lord Southampton, I have a message for your private ear. SOUTHAMPTON. Speak out, nor fear to wound me with the tydings: The worst is death, and that is past already. LIEUTENANT. My lord, I must intreat you will withdraw; Something of moment from her majesty. [Exeunt Southampton and Lieutenant. ESSEX. Cecil, when you approach an hour like this, You then may learn how low ambition is; How groundless is the quarrel, which contends For this vain worldâ'Till thenâ'till then and ever, The foes of Essex have free pardon. Ha! Enter SOUTHAMTON and Lieutenant. What new distress? what can this mean? in tears! Nay then the stroke must be severe indeed, That shocks the manly firmness of thy soul. O that the bitter cup were all my own! What is it, say? SOUTHAMPTON. It isâit isâO misery! 'Tis tortureâ'tis the death contriv'd by tyrants, It is the spinning of life's lingering thread To agony unspeakable; it is The death of friendship, the attempt to rend Th'eternal bonds of soul and soul asunder. The Queen hath sent meâ ESSEX. Warrant of death. SOUTHAMPTON. No, worseâ ESSEX. Can there be worse? SOUTHAMPTON. Yes, pardon. ESSEX. Catch the sound, Ye choiring angels, and with hovering wings Of ever wakeful 'tendance guard my Queen, Whose mercy at an hour like this has spar'd The guilt, the life of Essex, in his friend. SOUTHAMPTON. No, no, my brother, We will not partâSouthampton does disclaim Her barbarous mercyâWhat a joyless wild This world would be without thee! where alas, Where should I find the bosom to partake And double every joy? Where should I find The tender sympathizing heart to feel, And lighten ev'ry woe? No more the tongue Of friendship, sweetest music to the ear! Should greet my desart sense: no more my hours In social raptures steal away unmark'd; Those blessed hours when soul with soul converses, Transparent, pure, as from their bodies freed. O Essex, think upon the early ties That in our tender years join'd our fond hearts; Think how they grew, how they were twin'd together; And shall they now be parted? No, my Essex, In life we have been one, and in our deaths We will not be divided. ESSEX. âThere is a cause, a precious cause, my brother, Thou still must live, to love, to serve, to save him, All that shall suddenly be left of Essex; Where yet he lives, much more than to himself, Thro' every pulse, and trembling chord infus'd With quick, and dear sensationâLend thy bosom To hide one tear that will not be witheld, Yet here 'tis due from manhoodâO my wife!â SOUTHAMPTON. I had forgotâYes, Essex, I will liveâ For thy dear sake I'll make a weary pilgrimage, To guide thy other self thro' all the thorns And mazes of the world; 'till the wish'd hour By fate appointed comes, when we shall meet To part no more. ESSEX. Cherish, protect, support her. SOUTHAMPTON. Ever, ever. ESSEX. Then the great business of the world is overâ You two make all my treasure left on earth; Comfort each other, we shall meet hereafter In happier climesâThe heaven I have in view Will not be perfect elseâ'Till then, farewell. SOUTHAMPTON. Whilst I have speech to sayâ'till then, farewell. [Exit Southampton. ESSEX. Now on, my lords, and execute your office. [Exeunt Cecil and Raleigh. Enter RUTLAND and Ladies. RUTLAND. Where is he? let me catch him! hold him! save him! Rush on the stroke that would attempt his lifeâ Oh Essex, oh my lordâ ESSEX. âThis is too much! Too much for man!âI hop'dâah cruel dear; Were not eternity, and sudden death, Of weight sufficient to a mortal nature? And art thou come to reinforce their powers, And weaken what was left of man about me? RUTLAND. The Queen, my loveâthe queen permits this meeting, And therefore grants, that we shall part no more. ESSEX. What dost thou mean?âThy looks are wild, and keen; They pierce my soulâRetire, my angelâdoâ Let me prevail, and recollect thy spirits, But for a moment. RUTLAND. 'Tis impossibleâ High heaven doth know it is impossibleâ I cannot leave theeânever will I leave thee, Sure we may die togetherâ ESSEX. My soul's treasure! It is in vain, the hand of stronger fate Compels, and we must part. LIEUTENANT. My gracious lord, Your latest minute is at handâ RUTLAND. What's this? An axe! an executioner!â'Tis dreadful! I'm not prepar'd for thisâIs it a dream? If you have pity, wake me. ESSEX. A short absenceâ No moreâ'Tis but to bid one dear farewell, 'Till we do meet to part no more. RUTLAND. Ah whither would'st thou?âThink not to escape meâ No barbarous Essex, thou shalt never part me, I'll cling to thee in death. ESSEX. This, this, cuts keen And deep, beyond the shallow reach of steel; It is the quick of soul that here is pierc'd! Haste, haste, in pity as I stand dispatch meâ Is there not one, one hand of friendly mercy, To lodge a poniard here?â Quick, drag me to the blockâHelp me to sunderâ Yet hurt her notâIt is in vainâShe grasps me As in the agonies of deathâLost wretch! And wert thou born to this? Accurs'd the hour That gave me up to light!âYet more accurs'd That hour I once deem'd happiest over all The world calls happy, to this blessed flower Tying my baleful influenceâHa! she's going, Her speechless lip grows livid, and those orbs, Wane from their peerless lustreâGently, gently, Now loose her holdâSupport her.â LIEUTENANT. Now, my lord, 'Twere best to seize the occasionâThe time's past My orders areâ ESSEX. Come then, and push me off, Down the dark void that spreads upon futurity.â Oh! my lost love!â O Gem! for which the world were richly sold! If there's a heaven, can counterpoise thy loss, It is indeed beyond imagination! Night comes upon meâWhen my eyes have ta'en Their last, last lookâThe bitterness of death Is pastâAnd the world now is nothing. [Exeunt Essex, &amp;c. Enter QUEEN, NOTTINGHAM, Ladies and Gentlemen, &amp;c. QUEEN. Is he then gone?âTo! death?âEssex to death! And by my order?âNow perhapsâThis momentâ Haste Nottingham, dispatchâ NOTTINGHAM. What would your majesty! QUEEN. I know not what, I am in horrors, Nottingham, In horrors worse than deathâDoes he still live? Run, bring me wordâYet stayâCan you not save him Without my bidding? Read it in my heartâ In my distraction readâO, sure the hand That sav'd him, would be as a blessed angel's Pou'ring soft balm into my rankling breast. NOTTINGHAM. If it shall please your majesty to give Express commands, I shall obey them streightâ The world will think it strangeâBut you are Queen. QUEEN. Hard-hearted Nottingham! to arm my pride, My shame, against my mercy.âHa! what's here? A sight to strike resentment dead, and rouse Soft pity even in a barbarous breastâ It is the wife of Essex! Rise Rutland, come to thy repentant mistress: See the Queen bends to take thee to her bosom, And softer thee for everâRise. RUTLAND. Which way? Do you not see these circling steeps?â Not all the fathom lines that have been loos'd To sound the bottom of the faithless main, Could reach to draw me hence. Never was dug A grave so deep as thine!âHelp me, kind friend, Help me to put these little bones togetherâ These are my messengers to yonder world, To seek for some kind hand to drop me down, A little charity. QUEEN. Heart-breaking sounds! RUTLAND. These were an infant's bonesâBut hushâDon't tellâ Don't tell the Queenâ An unborn infant'sâMay be if 'tis known They'll say I murder'd itâIndeed I did notâ It was the axeâHow strange soe'er, 'tis true! Help me to put them right, and then they'll flyâ For they are light, and not like mine, incumber'd With limbs of marble, and a heart of lead. QUEEN. Alas! her reason is disturb'd; her eyes Are wild, and absentâDo you know me, Rutland? Do you not know your Queen? RUTLAND. O yes, the Queen! They say you've power of life, and deathâPoor Queen! They flatter you.âYou can take life away, But can you give it back? No, no, poor Queen.â Look at these eyesâThey are a widow's eyesâ Do you know that?âPerhaps indeed you'll say, A widow's eyes should weep, and mine are dry; That's not my fault, tears shou'd come from the heart, And mine is deadâI feel it cold within me, Cold as a stoneâBut yet my brain is hotâ O fye upon this head! it is stark naught; Beseech your majesty to cut it off, The bloody axe is readyâSay the word, (For none can cut off heads without your leave) And it is doneâI humbly thank your highness, You look a kind consent. I'll but just in And say a prayer or two. From my youth upwards I still said my prayers Before I slept; and this is my last sleep. Indeed 'tis not thro' fear, nor to gain timeâ Not your own soldier could meet death more bravely. You shall be judge yourself.âWe must make hasteâ I pray be readyâIf we lose no time, I shall o'ertake and join him on the way. [Exit Rutland. QUEEN. Follow her close, allure her to some chamber Of privacy; there sooth her frenzy, but Take care she go not forth. Heaven grant I may not Require such aid myself! for sure I feel A strange commotion here. Enter an Officer. OFFICER. May it please your majesty, The earl, as he address'd him to the block, Requested but the time to write these lines; And earnestly conjur'd me to deliver them Into your royal hands. QUEEN. QuickâWhat is here!âJust heaven! fly, take this signet Stop execution, fly with eagle's wingsâ What art thou?âOf this world. NOTTINGHAM. Ha!âI'm discover'dâ Then be it soâYour majesty may spareâ QUEEN. Stop, stop her yell!âHence to some dungeon, henceâ Deep sunk from day; in horrid silence there Let conscience talk to thee, infix its stings, Awake remorse, and desperate penitence; And from the torments of thy conscious guilt May hell be all thy refuge! [Exit Nottingham, guarded. Enter CECIL, RALEIGH, &amp;c. CECIL. Gracious madam, I grieve to say your order came too late; We met the messenger on our return From seeing the earl fall. QUEEN. Cecil, thou do'st not know what thou hast doneâ Pronounc'd sentence of death upon thy Queen. CecilâI will no more ascend my throne, The humble floor shall serve me; here I'll sit With moaping melancholy my companion, 'Till death unmark'd approach, and steal me to my grave. CecilâI never more will close these eyes In sleep, nor taste of foodâAnd Cecil now, Mark meâYou hear Elizabeth's last words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD, in the Character of Queen Elizabeth. If any here, are Britons but in name, Dead to their country's happiness and fame: Let 'em depart this momentâLet 'em fly My awful presence, and my searching eye! No more your Queen, but upright judge I come, To try your deeds abroad, your lives at home; Try you in ev'ry point, from small to great, Your Wit,âLaws,âFashions,âValor,âChurch and State! Search you, as Britons ne'er were search'd before: âO tremble! for you hear the lion roar!â Since that most glorious time that here I reign'd, An age and half!âWhat have you lost or gain'd? Your WitâWhate'er your poets sing or swear; Since Shakespear's time is somewhat worse for wear. Your Laws are good, your Lawyers good of course; The streams are surely clear, when clear the source: In greater store these blessings now are sent ye; Where I had one attorney, you have twenty. Fashions, ye fair, deserve nor praise nor blame; Unless they rise as foes to sense or shame; Wear ruffs, or gauzeâBut let your skill be such, Rather to shew too little, than too much. As for your Valourâhere my lips I closeâ Let those who best have prov'd itâspeakâYour foes. Your Morals, Church, and State, are still behindâ But softâprophetic fury fills my mind! I see thro' timeâBehold a youthful hand, Holding the sceptre of this happy land; Whose heart with justice, love, and virtue fraughtâ Born amongst Britons, and by Britons taught; Shall make the barking tongues of faction cease, And weave the garland of domestic peace: Long shall he reignâno storms to beat his breast, Unruly passions that disturb'd my rest! Shall live, the blessings he bestows, to share, Reap all my glory, but without my care. FINIS.</field>
