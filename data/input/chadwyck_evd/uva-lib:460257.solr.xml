      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. Of this Play, A FINISHED COPY was, a few years ago, sent from Dublin, for the purpose of introducing it on an English Stage. That design, through some neglect, not taking place, it was resolved to insert the Play in this Collection: but when the FINISHED COPY was demanded, âit could not be found.â A long and severe illness having rendered the Author incapable of attending to this publication, the person to whose care it has been confided, can print the Play only from an old and unfinished copy; in which, however, he thinks, there is a degree of merit that entitles it to preservation.</field>

Servius, Cataline, Sempronius, Attendants on Valerius. WOMEN. JULIA, Wife of Fabius. VALERIA, her Daughter, by a former Husband. LAVINIA, adopted Daughter of Fabius.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in the House of Fabius. To Fabius writing, Lavinia enters. Fabius. I wish'd to hold some talk with you, Lavinia, In absence of my wife.âAre you not well? Lavin. A slight indisposition, my good lord? Fabius. Wherefore that sigh?âWhy went you not to grace The triumph? Lavin. O, my lord! I take small joy In shew or tumult. Fabius. I have mark'd, of late, Your looks are of the sad and pining castâ Your eyes bend nearer to the earth, Lavinia. Lavin. In sooth, my honour'd patron, I had a jealous fear, that, of late time, Your looks past o'er me with unwonted coldness. Fabius. O weak misprision!âArt thou not the child Of my adoptionâeven as my own offspring, Dear to my heart? Lavin. Upon my bended knee, I thank you!âBut, good sir, your honour'd wife, My lady, grows more difficult of late, And takes my service with distaste. Fabius. Well, wellâ Soon as her darling daughter is disposed of To this young conqueror, your high-born step-dame May come to better temper.âStill you sigh! Lavin. Your pardon, sir!âWere your first lady living, I had not learn'd to sigh! Fabius. But, is there not another cause?âPerhaps, Your thoughts, at times, may turn on that brave youth, Whose valour wrought your great deliverance. Lavin. Surelyâ I, else, were most ungrateful! Fabius. I own it.â I have heard your general obligations to him; But wish you would be more particular Respecting that adventure. Lavin. On a visit To my poor mother at her little farm, The season smiled; and we o'erlook'd the pales That faced the Appian-way. Lord Clodius came With a proud equipage.âHe pray'd admission; But that denied, they burst the gateâI shriek'd, And fled, and cried for helpâbut he pursued, O'ertook me, and, with brutal violence, WouldâO the gods!âwhen I beheld his head Struck from his shoulders!âTwo of his attendants, At two strokes more, lay breathless! The rest join'd To fall on my defenderâbut his motions, Active as lightning, forceful as it's bolt, Soon turn'd them to vain flight; for not a man Survived to bear the tidings! Fab. 'Twas a god, A god in human form!âDid you enquire His lineage or condition? Lav. Yes, my lord. He said, he would informs us, when his actions Should have approved him worthy of the blood From whence he sprung. Three happy days he staid, And held us in Elysium. But O, his converseâhow divinely sweet Flow'd Wisdom from his youthful lips!âeven Truth Grew fairer as he talk'd! Fab. Soft, my Laviniaâ Here comes your step-dame! Lav. I'll retire, my lord. [Exit Lavinia. SCENE II. To Fabius, Julia and Valeria. Fab. Welcome, my ladies!âCome ye from the triumph? Julia. We do, my lord. Fab. I, also, had been there, But these old wounds, I thank the Catti for them, This in my hip, and this within my ancle, Grow troublesome at seasons. Then you have seen him, This youthful hero, this all-praised soldier!â Cimbrius, I think they stile him. Julia. Yes, Cimbriusâ The name of honour which the Senate gave him; And which, appointed heralds, at sun-rising, Proclaim'd thro' all the shouting streets of Rome. Fab. Wellâbut the manner of his triumphâtell us. Julia. Impossibleâit beggars all description! From gate Capena to the Capitol, Even through the whole Triumphal Way, each interval, Floor above floor, was scaffolded so high, As made all eyes below to ach.âThe world, The world was emptyâRome, alone, was full Of heads and eyes; no other part appear'd From windows, pinnacles, and chimney-tops! At length, a deafening shout was heard, that rent The upper element, and made all Rome Shake to her deep foundations!âThen began The pomp, in full procession. Fab. Wellâpass that, And hasten to the Victor.â I mean it not in boast; but, sure, my Julia Has seen a triumph before this. Julia. True, sirâ When first my Fabius, ere he was my Fabius, Gave me to be enamour'd of his glories! Fab. No more of that, I prayâhaste to young Cimbrius. Julia. After the passing of some miles in length, Of Lictors, Magistrates, and troops of war, Follow'd by carriages of corselets, helms, And pikes, and mingling swords, whose martial din Shiver'd our organsâthere appear'd a company Of laurell'd youths, bearing the richer spoils Of antique vases, goblets high-emboss'd With gold or pearls, and silver houshold gods, Paintings and sculptures, works of art that made The rich material poor!âNext came, adorn'd, The bulls for sacrifice, whose whiteness match'd The snow upon SoractÃ©!âDistant far, High on his car, the Victor then appear'd, Preceded by a length of breathing flutes, And many a sweet according instrument, That suddenly gave way, or were all sunk In the loud trumpet's brazen soundâagain, The trumpets were as quickly sunk, and lost In deafening acclamations!â Fab. Now, at last, We have himâhere comes Cimbrius!âWell, how look'd he?â Say, like a Victor, was it?âlike a man Deserving this supremacy of glory? Julia. How shall I speak it?âO, my noble Fabius, Never did such a lowliness of aspect, Such humbled grace of person and demeanour, Pluck insolence from exaltation's seat, And put all pride to shame! Fab. Then I am happy!â But what am I to look for, now, my Julia?â Hast thou bethought thee, how to bear thyself Beneath this weight of aggregated glory?â What, aunt and mother to this first of heroes!â So richly blooded, and so highly raised, These honours may be held as all thine own, And we look little in thine eyes. Julia. No, no, No fear!âmy noble lord knows rightly well, How to maintain his port, as well at home, As in the field or senate. Fab. Tell me, Julia, Is this the first time thou hast seen thy nephew, This topic of all tongues?âI am inform'd, That, from his cradle to his car of triumph, He scarce has seen his country, scarce has set His virtuous foot in Rome. Julia. 'Tis true, my lordâ He had scarce forgot the milk of his fond mother, When he was sent to Athens. Having finish'd An early education, he pass'd, thence, To Crete, to Egypt, Palestine, Assyria; And, last, return'd to Rome, the most accomplish'd Of all the youths that Rome had ever boasted. Fab. Then, sure, you saw him.â Julia. No, my daughter, here, And I, were absent at our country villa. 'Twas at the time the Teutones and Cimbri Had made their dread irruption; and Favonius, Now titled Cimbrius, scarce had time to greet His sire and kinsfolk, ere he was dispatch'd, With high commission, under the great consul, Attilius, general of the war. Fab. The rest, I have learn'd from fameâhis deeds of high atchievement; The general's death, and the approved succession Of Cimbrius to command; his following conquest; And now, his triumph!âBut, what says Valeriaâ Does she approve our choice?â Valeria. O, my good lord, I need not blushâand yet I blush to own I think myself too blest, too much exalted Above my little merits!âAh, might Cimbrius Approve your choice alike!âthere, there's the doubt, The fear that trembles at my heart!â Fab. No, no, No doubt, no fear!âBut here the Pontiff comes. SCENE III. Valerius enters, preceded by Lictors with their fasces, and other Officers. Valer. Hail to this honour'd house!âMy brother Fabius, My sister, and my nieceâmy daughter nowâ All hail!âValeria, tell me, have you seen My gallant son?âDoes he engage your favour? Fab. Your niece, my lord, is rather pale with fear, Lest he should not like her! Valer. Not like her, say you?â He cannot chuseâhe will, he must, he shall!â Valeria. Alas, my uncle! Liking, I fear, is not to be controul'dâ Were that to rest upon constraint, I doubt I should be then most wretched! Valer. Doubt no more.â I would fain see a son, who, but in thought, Dare prove repugnant to his father's pleasure. Parents, in Rome, stand in the place of gods To all their offspringâour will is absolute!â Hence discipline ensues; and hence, we have Good sons, good men, good soldiers, and good citizens! How is your fair Adopted, brother Fabiusâ How fares Lavinia? Fab. Somewhat indisposedâ She went not to the triumph. Valer. Then, the triumph Wanted its chiefest ornament!â Soon as my son and our Valeria here Are married, the fortunes of Lavinia Become our nearest care. Fab. I thank your greatness. [Trumpets. Valer. These trumpets speak the coming of my Cimbrius! I order'd his attendance.âLeave, I pray yeâ Leave till we talk awhile!â [Exeunt Julia, Valeria, and Fabius. SCENE IV. Favonius enters, and kneels to Valerius. Valer. Junius Favonius Cimbrius, welcome, welcome!â Brave son of Rome, the glory of thy country, And pride of the Valerii, welcome! [Raises, and embraces him. Offâ And let me view theeâlet me feast my eyes, Long famish'd by the absence of my childâ My laurel'd boy! I swear it by the gods, When first thy mother prest thee to her bosom, Her looks dwelt not upon thee with a smile Of equal tenderness, of equal transport! Favon. O, sir! Oppress me not with this excess of goodness. Be it enough that I have done my duty; And dared, in some degree, to emulate My father's great example! Valer. O, thou art The fullness of thy father's every wish; All that wide craving avarice could ask, Or high ambition sigh for! therefore 'tis That, by ensuring of my child's prosperity, I shall ensure my own. Favon. What means my Lord? Valer. 'Tis meet that, after such a length of studies, Of toilsome travels, camps, and harsh encounters, My son should taste enjoyment: I have, therefore, Provided for your happinessâPrepare For Hymen's highest blessings! Favon. What, for marriage? Valer. Yes. Favon. Surely I have not understood my father.â Contracted, mean you, sir? Valer. Yes, to Rome's fairest, chastest, richest heiressâ For so I have ordain'd it. Favon. I am my father's image, not a thing To barter at a market. Valer. Loth I am, Amidst his laurels, to remind a conquerorâ That he, too, is my property. Favon. Yesâwell, Too well I know, what the rude laws of Rome EnjoinâMy body, sir, I grant is your's For death or bondageâbut I have been in Greece, Tutor'd amid the schools of liberty; And thence I learn, that I have here, within, A principle of freedom, over which No father has a right to assume controul! Valer. Rash and misdeeming boy!âBut I'll be calmâ Presume not yet upon a father's fondness!â Dost thou then think, that young and headstrong passion, To interest blind, and ever prone to error, Can judge, and plan, and build for happiness, Like old and tried experience? Favon. Can experience, Can age pronounce on what will constitute The happiness of Cimbrius? Valer. Yes, assuredlyâ And if the gods have given him sense, or sight, The smallest share of rational discernment, He cannot but exult in my election, Favon. Alas, my father, there are cases, surely, Wherein not reason's self can arbitrate Between the sexesâthe soul-linking union, The tender, the involuntary feelings, The commerce of free hearts! Valer. 'Tis, therefore, needful, That such impetuous, wayward, idle passion, Should be subjected to the guiding rein Of age and just authority.âBut here, There is no quailingâI have seal'd my promiseâ My honour is at stake, and must be ransom'd. Favon. Say you, my lord?âmust I, to ransom yours, Betray my own? must I turn prostitute, Yield up my body unto loath'd embraces; And the free choice of my immortal spirit, To bondage worse than death?âO, think not of it!â Nature, sense, reason, duty, piety, The gods forbid! Valer. Is this your answer, rebel? Favon. O, sir, my honour'd father! would to Heaven, [Bends the knee, and kisses his hand. I might obey youâbut, alas, this matter Is not at my own optionâCan I give That heart, those inclinations, to another, Which I, myself, cannot command? yet, sir, In all I can, I live but to oblige you. Who is this lady, by whose fair conveyance, You have chosen to deliver, to posterity, The honours of your name? Valer. She is the daughter of the noble Fabius. Favon. Of Fabius, sirâof Fabius? Valer. Yes.âDost thou Know aught of Fabius? Favon. By report, my lord, Much to his honourâto his daughter's too, Touching her high pre-eminence in beauty, And every mental excellence. Valer. 'Tis wellâ He comes. SCENE V. Fabius enters. Valer. Brother, behold your son! [To Fabius. Fab. O, hero! Boast of thy kindred, glory of thy country! Come to my heart, and fix thee there the pearl Of choicest estimation! [Embraces. Favon. Then, the gods Have heard my soul's warm prayer, to be admitted To learn the precepts, and to imitate The acts of the great Fabius! SCENE VI. Julia enters. Valer. Favonius Cimbrius, you behold your aunt, My sister, late the widow of Trebonius; But grafted, now, on the illustrious stock Of the most noble Fabii. [They embrace. Julia. My child, my blood, nay, my loved self!âMethinks I see our ancestors descending on us, The long unrivall'd train of the Valerii, All glorying in their Cimbrius, and assuming New honours from his name. Favon. O, my kind aunt! So I may not disgrace your honour'd ancestors, My glory has its limit. SCENE VII. Valerius hands in Valeria. Valer. This is my niece, your cousin, the fair daughter Of your aunt Julia. [They salute. Favon. May superior happiness, Shining and bright as her superior beauty, Attend her ever! Valer. O, confirm his wish, Ye powers of bliss!âLook down, ye favouring gods! And ye blest shades of our renown'd forefathers, Perfect their union! This, this, my Cimbrius, is the beauteous maid, Of whom I told youâthe fair virgin bride, Ordain'd to make you happy. [Joins their hands. Favon. How, my lord! [Withdraws his hand. Did you not say that she was Fabius' daughter? Valer. She is, my son; His much beloved, his late adopted daughter. Favon. And have you not, Lord Fabius, have you not Another daughter? Julia. Yesâat least, so stiledâ A nominal adoption!âone who is A stranger to his blood, as to his fortunesâ A beggar'd orphan!âone he took from want, In charity of nature! Fab. O, not so, Not so, my love!âLavinia has her merit; And is of ancient ancestry, the first, Even the first in Romeâat least when Rome Esteem'd her Romans, not by wealth, but virtue! Julia. No matterâlet her passâshe is not worth The questionâ'Tis this scholar here, who piques me; Who, in his halls of high philosophy, Has rudely learn'd to scorn a lady's favour!â This soldier tooâwho, swoln with his exploits, Looks scornful down upon the noblest house Of his own ancestors! Valer. He dare notâfor his life, he dare not do itâ He knows his duty; knows my word is past, Irrevocably firm, and fix'd as fate!â But, let us not pollute this day of joy, With clouded omen, and with needless quarrel. I leave him with youâshould he treat our daughter With less than that respect, that tender delicacy, Fitting her merit, and his own engagements, May all the curses of the avenging gods, Of Rome's dread genii, and our great forefathers, Fall on his guilty head! [Exeunt the Pontiff and his train one way; Julia, Valeria, Favonius, and Fabius, another. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Favonius and Valeria. Favon. Ah, fair Valeriaâfair as morning light, And gentler than its dew dropsâhold me not So churlish, as to close my eyes, or heart, To thy bright form or mind! I do confess, I find them, both, pre-eminently lovelyâ Butâ Valeria. But what, my lord?âAh, that impending but!â Sayâstrike at once, and let me learn my fate, In all its horrors! Favon. O, that just Heaven had form'd some nobler youth, Sweet as thy manners, as thy person lovely; Endow'd with all that Heaven itself could give Of goodness or of gloryâwith a heart, That to thine own struck unison; that own'd, In all the givings of the bounteous gods, No blessing but Valeria! Valeria. Noârather that the goddesses, who strove On Ida for pre-eminence, had graced me With their joint giftsâto wisdom adding empire, And charms of irresistible attraction!â Or, to express my every wish in one, That they had made me worthyâO ye gods! Must I betray the secret of my soul?â That they had made me worthy of Favonius! Favon. Alas!âeven so, Favonius would have had No heart to give. Ha!âdo ye mock me, gods!âor is it more Than a bless'd vision?âYes, she comes upon me, Like dawning on the darkness, bringing hope, And healing in her hand!â SCENE II. Lavinia enters, as passing through the apartment. Loved, loveliest Maid! Soft seat of every virtue, every beauty!â Do I once more behold thee? Lavin. My heart's master! Am I so blest to see thee, once again?â Thus, humbly, let me thank the bounteous gods, And you, my great preserver! [Lavinia kneelsâFavonius raises her, and, while they converse apart, Valeria eyes them with jealous attention. Valeria. Death to my heart, they do not meet like strangers! He knows her, and is known!âWith what an eye They look their very souls into each other! Perhaps, long knownâperhaps, already vow'd, Or bound in nuptial bands!âMy hopes are blasted, Wreck'd, lost for ever!âSick, sick to death! Undone, undone Valeria! [Valeria sinks on a sopha. Lavin. Alas, my sister swoons!âwhat may this mean? What are you, sir?âPerhaps, her late betroth'd!â Favon. Your Junius, my Laviniaâyour firm Juniusâ Junius Favonius Cimbrius!â Lavin. Then I do see the powers are bent on ruin!â Away, my lord, away!â [Favonius retires. Valeria, sister!âah, she's breathless!âHelpâ Who's there?âfor Heaven's sake, help!âMy Lady Julia, Help, help!â SCENE III. Julia and Attendants enter. Julia. Who calls?âHow's this!âmy daughter dying? O, my lost child!âFly, all of youâbring odours, Physicians bringâaway, search Rome for medicine!â Helpâraise her to the air!âSpeak to me, child! Look up, my love!âspeak, speak to your fond mother, And snatch her from distraction! As Lavinia is busy in affording help, Valeria turns from her, and waves her hand in token that she should be gone. Julia. Lavinia, go! [Lavinia withdraws. Valeria. I think, I now am more at easeâBut, still, My heart! my heart!â Dear mother of a wretched child, direct That we be left alone!â Julia. Depart this moment!â [Exeunt Attendants. Now tell me; ease my throbbings! Valeria. Yes, when tearsâ When tears permit me. Julia. Ah, my only loved! What mean these gushing floods, these deep fetch'd sobsâ This passion, that has seized thy tender frame With rending agitation? Valeria. O, Favonius! Julia. What, has he dared to treat my child with insult? Valeria. No, my fond mother!âSoon as you had left us, His looks, his accents, actions, all were framed To gentlenessâto pity, so like love, It seem'd, indeed, the dawn of young affection! While time was thus suspended in sweet doubt, Lavinia would have past usâat the view Favonius started!âhis collected spirits Stream'd from his eager eyesâhe addrest her, In terms so soft, of such endearing raptureâ Julia. What, at first sight? Valeria. Yesâbut I soon remark'd, That they were far from strangers to each other; While, wrapt in fond and mutual gratulations, They saw not me, and the entranced Favonius, Had eyes for her aloneâ'Tis sure, too sure, This was not their first interviewâperhaps, Long knownâand O, perhaps, already join'd! Julia. Sayst thou?âthe mighty heir of the Valerii, The greatest, wealthiest, first hope of Rome, Espouse himself to scorn, to beggaryâ A thing without a nameâand thus pollute The long ennobled stream of our forefathers? He cannot, shall not!âBut I'll rid your sight Of this plebeian sorceressâsweep her forth To seek a hungry living on the Dole, From whence the folly of old Fabius rais'd her. Valeria. O mother, why contract me to a stranger? Would he had been a stranger still!âthat I Had never heard the name, or learn'd the praise, Or seen the face of this renown'd Favonius! Ere I beheld him, I had form'd his image Tender, and kind, and grateful to my wishesâ But, when the light of this day's sun arose To usher in his triumphâwhen the shouts Of distant multitudes all-hail'd his name, And near, and nearer still, approached mine ear With swelling acclamations, that proclaimed The hero was at handâmy pulse beat high; Through my strain'd eyes my soul went forth to meet him: And as he came, all glorious in the spoils Of conquered nations, His youthful brow laurel'd like fire-eyed Mars, And his fair form conducted by the Graces; My heart avow'd his fetters, and attended The surest captive of his train! SCENE IV. Fabius enters. Fab. Alas, They tell me that our dear Valeria here Was suddenly affected. Julia. And is that Your care, my lord? Fab. Why should it be a question? Julia. Indeed, I once had hope, that, in this house, You harbour'd none with purpose to insult us! Fab. What may this mean?âSure, Julia ought to know, That, o'er my heart and house, and all in them, She rules supreme. Julia. When Julia married Fabius, Her hand, the world presumed, no trifling honour To the first man in Rome. Fab. The world was just! Julia. It brought you wealth, and high alliance, sirâ And, sure, such gifts are poorly recompensed, By insult to Valeria. Valeria. Dearest madam, Recall your temper to its wonted calmness!â My lord is not to blame. Fab. Tell me, or in this house, in peopled Rome, Or through her vast domain, who has offended? And instant satisfaction shall be made, Till it o'erpass the limit! Julia. 'Tis wellâbut, tell me first, my honour'd lordâ This same Laviniaâis she of your blood?â Fab. No, madam! Julia. Daughter, as I take it, ofâ A worthless widowâoneâ Fab. Terentia, madam! Julia. The sameâand her you took to your adoption, To heir the honours of the boasted Fabii! Fab. I didâbut, madam, I was then the master Both of my proper fortunes and affections. Julia. Right, sirâextremely right!âBut now be told, This daughter of your fortunes and affections Must not expect to brave us, unreprovedâ This is no mansion, sir, for her and Julia To mate together. Fab. She shall quit it, then. Who's there? Servant enters Serv. My Lord. Fab. Haste thee to Terentia, And bring her hither! [Exit Servant. But, why should we disturb our houshold peace With causeless altercation?âPray, unfoldâ Wherein offends Lavinia? Julia. She, my lord, Flies much too high a pitch; an eaglet soaring, Her eye upon the sun!âMy daughter, here, She holds unworthy of a hero's bed; Steps in between Valeria and our choice, And deems herself, alone, of eminence To mate with the great heir of the Valeriiâ To marry with Favonius! Fab. With Favonius?â She knows him not. Julia. Most surely. Fab. Impossible! Julia. She knows him, and is known. Fab. Is known? Julia. Familiar!âPerhapsâ Fab. O, fye, fye, fye!â As chaste, I swear by Sol's unsully'd rays, As are the virgin-purities, who tend The sacred vigils of the vestal-fire! Beside, her honest heart is, long since, plighted To a young soldier, who once saved her honour. But comeâbe temperateâshe shall answer this, Even at your own tribunal, face to face!â Prepare your heaviest chargeâWho waits? A Servant enters. Serv. My Lord? Fab. Bid Lavinia hither!â [Exit Servant. I now remember, That when the Pontiff would have join'd your hands, Young Cimbrius, with a coldness most unseemly, Drew back, and question'd somewhat, did he not, Touching another daughter? Valeria. Yes, my Lordâ That question sent a dagger to my heart; And, fatal as a sybil's sentence, told me, He meant no other than the blest Lavinia. Fab. Lavinia? noâit cannot, must not beâ Their births, their stations, are too much unsorted!â No, Julia, noâalthough I hold her dear, Dear from her infant years of lisping sweetness, Bred at my knee, and cherish'd in my bosomâ Yet would I rather weep upon her urn, Than see our labour'd structure thus o'erthrown; Than see her wedded to Favonius Cimbrius. Julia. Indeed, my Lord, your justice bade me look For nothing lessâthe house of the Valerii, Can merit no dishonour at the hands Of Fabius. Fab. Noneâall honourâand shall have it!â But here she comesâSoft, Juliaâgood, my love, Restrain your angerâdo not wound her gentleness By too severe an accent! Julia. I am lesson'd. SCENE V. Lavinia enters. Fab. Come near, LaviniaânearerâDost thou know To what end thou art summon'd?âSpeak! Lavin. O, sir!â [Kneels. Fab. Why dost thou tremble?âIf thou art innocent, Wherefore thus change thy colour?â Lavin. O, my Lord, The dove, though guiltless, trembles, when Jove's bird Bears thunder in his talons.âI do see, In every brow that now is bent before me, My sentence plainly written. Fab. Riseâstand up! Fear not, but briefly answer meâWho am I? Lavin. My masterâthan the gods scarce less revered; Who took me in, a helpless, friendless orphan, To undeserv'd protection. Fab. Whatâno more? Lavin. Much, muchâWho while your favour was toward me, Did lift me, from the dust, to high adoption; And stiled me by the dear, the melting names, Of child, of daughter! Fab. Dost thou owe me aught Of duty, then? Lavin. All, all, my sovereign lord! The little that I am, without reserveâ Obedience absolute. Fab. I, then, should trust Thou wouldst not bring reproach upon the house, Wherein thou art ingrafted. Lavin. Not for worlds! Fab. Dost know Favonius Cimbrius?âSpeakâlook at me! Lavin. I do, my Lord! Fab. When didst thou see him last? Lavin. Within this hour. Valeria. My Lord, they are familiarâ She held him in close converse. Fab. Peace, Valeria!â When didst thou see him first? Lavin. Some twelve moons since. Fab. That's strange!âAnd, did he talk of love? Lavin. He did. Julia. To thee, to thee of love?âa falsehood deep, As deep as Erebus! Fab. Good Julia, patienceâ Passion does but defeat its proper purpose! Tell me, Laviniaâdidst thou know him, then, To be Favonius Cimbrius? Lavin. No, my Lordâ The Cimbrii, as I think, were then unconquer'd; I only knew him, by the name of Junius. Julia. I see, I see, it now, clear as the Capitol! He did deceive theeâhe meant thee for his prostitute! Lavin. This is hard treatment, sir. [Weeps. Fab. Give me thy pardon for herâMark me, Juliaâ Another word like that, and I dismiss her!â Yet tell meâtell me truly, my Laviniaâ Wouldst thou espouse Favonius? Lavin. No, my Lordâ That were a hard return for his affection!â Though he were dearly tied unto my heart By every vital cord, I would not wed him! Perish Lavinia, die a thousand deaths, Ere she would bring the man she loved to shame, Or call upon his high and honour'd head The just reproaches of his friends and country! Fab. Most nobly answer'dâthou art still my daughter! Wilt thou then promise, wilt thou swear, Lavinia, No more to see, no more to listen to him, But yield thy interests in him to Valeria? Lavin. It is most meetâbefore the gods, I swear it! But knowâI yield her more, much more than life!â This is the soldier, sir, of whom I told you. Fab. Your soldier?âwhat, Favonius?â Lavin. True, too trueâ The youth, whose valour saved me! Fab. O, my child! I fearâI fearâthou art, indeed, most wretched! Lavin. Now, sirâupon my bended knee I crave itâ Return me to my mother!âO, return me, Back to my native indigenceâto light The lamp of early industry, and earn The little I may want!âHere I restore you These costly ornaments, these gems and pearls, With the proud title of that high adoption, Wherewith you deigned to grace meâmuch unequal To such a weight of honoursâneedless all! The world, to me, is empty! Julia. Thou smooth enchantress! well thou know'st the way To wind about my Lord's too easy heart, And mould him to thy bentâHence, to thy chamber! Thou wouldst abroad, like wanton birds in spring, To chirp it with thy paramour! Fab. No more!â Bear with us, my Lavinia, for this day; The morrow shall determine of thy fortunes. Yet mark!â At thy tenth year thou wast ordain'd a vestal, When my adoption rent thee from the hand Of the stern PontiffâBut, if thou swerve From what thou hast swornâif thou dost see, or hear, Or hold the slightest commerce with Favoniusâ By the dread mother of the gods, I swear, To yield thee to her temple, cast thee off To solitude eternal! [Exeunt all but Laviniaâwho looks after them, weeping. A Servant enters. Serv. Madam, your mother is arrived. [Exit. SCENE VI. Terentia enters. Lavin. My mother! Teren. My child, my dear Lavinia! [They embrace. What, still in tears, like mountain rills that flow Incessant from their spring?âWhat is thy trouble? Unlade the burden of thy griefs, and I Will bear it all. Lavin. Then I have still a friendâand that is plenty To one, so very much a wretch!âYet, mother, Were you not cruel?âah, why cast me from you! Why break the bands of nature's best alliance? Why yield me to another? Teren. Lest with thy mother thou shouldst share misfortune, And poverty and scorn be all thy portion! Lavin. Is poverty so dreadful?âPoverty, Parent of rosy Health, and smiling Peace, Who sits, with Freedom, on the mountain top, Discoursing with the Virtues!âPoverty, Who pointed Rome the truest way to greatness, Held sacred by her honourable sons, The wealth of our forefathers! Teren. Alas, my child, those glories are no more! Want sculks a lonely criminal in Rome, And lowers the cheek of shame; while lordly Wealth, Though leagued with Rapine, lifts the staff of office, And looks reproof to Virtue. Yet there are Some, truely Roman, though in Rome! and such Is Fabiusâhe, who begg'd thee from my arms, And swore to love thee with a father's fondness! Lavin. No more a father now, your child, no more, Can find a fostering summer in his looks! His speech is distant, and his passing eye Confesses me an alien! Teren. Is it possible!â Wherein have you offended? Lavin. I am all offence, an hourly nuisanceâ The worm that preys upon a jealous step-dame! She eyes me as her omen of ill fortuneâ As the sad shade of some ill-stationed tree, That hangs disastrous o'er her daughter's beauties, And intercepts her hopeâAlas, my mother, This Cimbrius, this renown'd, of whom Rome rings, Who should you think he is?âeven that brave youth, That very Junius, who, in my defence, Slew Clodius and his train. Teren. The gods are gracious! Lavin. How?â For lifting him, on whom my soul was center'd, Where even the secret wishes of Lavinia Must never dare to soar? Teren. Be told, thenâthat Lavinia is a mate For any mortal hero; any consort, Less than the son of Jove! Lavin. What wild extravagance!â Beside, he stands contracted, by his father, To the first heiress of the Commonwealth, Even to Valeria. Teren. No matterâhis first vows were yours, firm plighted Before the gods and me!âBut I haste homeward: Ere night I trust to bring credentials with me, That shall unfold these riddles. [Exit. Lavin. I stand amazed!âwhat should my mother mean? Some sudden malady, I fear, has seiz'd her! SCENE VII. Favonius enters. Favon. O, my Lavinia!âBlessed interview! Lavin. Alas, why venture here, my lord Favonius?â Are you, then, bent upon my ruin? Favon. Hear meâ But for a momentâjust to tell my love.â Lavin. Alas, I am sworn, no more to hear, to see youâ But yield my interests in you to Valeria. Favon. You cannotâI am yours, and you are mine, By nature's union of connubial hearts, And every sacred band!âNot all the powers On earth, shall tear us from each other! noâ Rather despair shall seek the field of Mars, Where camp my legions, to beleaguer Rome, As once did Caius Mariusâturn the war Upon my father, countryâon the world, Rather than aught shall rend, from my fond arms, All that the world contains of estimation! Lavin. Away!âI am undone!âthe Pontiff comesâ Behold his lictors!âLost, lost Lavinia! [Exit Favonius. SCENE VIII. Valerius enters, preceded by LictorsâTo him, Julia and Valeria, from the opposite side. Julia. Justice, Lord Pretor!âwe demand strict justice! Valer. Say, on whom? Julia. The criminal before you! Valer. Lavinia, mean you?â'tis not in her nature To give offence. Julia. My lord, you know her notâshe's false and perjured! This very day, she swore, to all the gods, No more to see, or listen to Favonius; And yet, the passing moment has beheld her In secret converse with him. Valer. Does she then know Favonius? Valeria. Ah, too wellâ Too closely intimate! Julia. And Fabius vow'd, on their next interview, To doom her to eternal continence, In Vesta's temple. Valer. Leave us together! [Exeunt Julia and Valeria. Valer. Lavinia! loveliest maid! the gods do know, You must not marry Cimbrius! Lavin. No, my Lord! Valer. Not that I think Lavinia undeserving A greater than Favoniusâsuch, indeed, I had provided for her!âSay, my child, Will you commit the chusing of your husband, To me your anxious friend? Lavin. O, my dread Lord, Let it suffice that I refuse your son, That I have vow'd no further commerce with him! Yet, widow'd to all else, the very thought Of any other choice is horror to me! Valer. Then, hasten to the temple.âJulia!â SCENE IX. Julia and Valeria enter. Valer. Lavinia, with strange obstinacy, turns My friendship to displeasure!â Hence with her to the Fane!âby holy Vesta, I will not sup, till she becomes thy votary! Lavin. Do your own pleasure with meâ In all events, I have a sweet associate Stiled PatienceâThat I was not born to joy, My heart long since foretoldâand should my lot Be cast for sufferance, still my spirit says, So be it, Heaven! [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Portico and Ayles in the Temple of Vesta.âThe Vestals and Inferior Pontiffs, in white robes, ranged on each side. Enter Lavinia, Julia, Valeria, and Attendants, on one side; Valerius, with inferior Pretors, and Lictors, on the opposite side. The Chief Vestal walks through the midst, bearing the sacred fire in a silver censer. Valer. Reach forth the sacred flame! [Takes it from the Vestal. Lavinia, stand before us!âNow to make Your last electionâChuse this holy fire, Or yield you to the wishes of your friends! Lavin. Give me the vow, my Lord! Valer. Suppose your father, Fabius, should approve This offer'd partnerâby the laws of Rome, You are at his disposal. Lavin. My Lord, my father, Fabius, did, long since, Confirm my plighted vows to your Favonius, When, in the semblance of a Roman knight, His valour rescued me from violation. Valer. By this dread fane, and its presiding power, I rather, with a torch in either hand, Would light your funeral pyres, than see you join'd To Junius Cimbrius! Lavin. I also swear, that were the pit now yawning, Where vestals have deplored their broken vows, I rather would descend the mortal steps, To lay me in the griesly arms of death, Circled with horrors and eternal darkness, Than wed another! Valer. O, to the last perverse!âThen take thy destiny! Begin the solemn rites. [Gives her the fire. Lavinia bearing the censer in her right hand, is led by Valerius, and followed by Julia and Valeria, the Pretors, &amp;c. in slow procession into the Temple. SCENE II. Valerius returns alone. Valer. Had she not seen himâor, would he consent To wed anotherâhope might yet revive, And bring new blossoms forthâMust he fix here, Where my whole soul was seal'd?âfrom infancy, I had decreed her mine. Curs'd chance!âwhy did they meet?âor, rather, why Have I thus fostered a young pelican, Who tears my bosom, and who drinks my blood? I gave him lifeâmy life he takes away, By heart-distending tortures! SCENE III. Favonius enters. Favon. O, my Lordâ Lavinia made a votary of Vesta! She cannot, sir, she must notâ'twere a breach Of laws divine and human! She is mine, My sworn, my plighted bride, my soul's espous'd, By every band that can retain the universe From sinking into chaos! Valer. Sir, those bands Might have been somewhat firmer, had they claim'd The sanction of a father's hand! Favon. 'Tis trueâ I own it, my dread lord!âbut then there was not, Or time, or place, or possibility Of suit, for that dear sanction. At first interview, Our conscious looks exprest the mutual stroke Of fated loveâtogether rush'd our souls, Like meeting streams no more divisible, Since each was lost in the other!â Valer. Darest thou, then, Avow, nay, vindicate thy breach of duty? Favon. But to solicit pardon for a fault Inevitableâwhere my will itself Had lost all power, so suddenly made captive! O, if you ever felt the sickening passion, Have pity!âif you ever felt the sense Of human frailty, pardon!âOn my knee Thus prostrate, catching, grasping at your clemencyâ If, in the bridal arms of my chaste mother, You ere knew transportâif your parent heart Knew meltings, when she brought your first born forth, And gave a little self into your arms, Have mercy!âO, restore my heart's sole love, My indivisible, who, in the parting, Pulls with her life itself! Valer. Favonius, riseâ Rise, my dear child!âI call the gods to witness, That were the universe at my disposal, There is but one thing in that universe, I would refuse to Cimbrius!âSuch a father May merit some concession, sureâsome proof Of filial reverence, of filial love! Favon. Put me to instant trialâlet it be To pass the flame! to scale the dizzy pinnacle! Or, in the wrath and whirling of the tempest, To plunge unto the bottom of the deep, And bring the pearl of your desires to light, Or perish!â Valer. I pity poor Valeria, But plead for her no more!âLook round, my sonâ Search the expanded world, for highest excellence, For highest stationâall my powers shall be Exerted for youâall my wealth pour'd forth, As water on the flooded beach, to swell The spring-tide of your bliss! Favon. O, sirâLaviniaâ Valer. Away, away! the bars are infinite, Insuperable!âBut, I well perceive, Proud, stubborn boy, because in this, alone, I would oppose, 'tis, therefore, thou art obstinate, Rebellious!â Favon. Drive me not to desperation!â You may repent, and soon! Valer. YesâI have heard Of thy intrigues amongst the frantic legionsâ Go, traitorâturn their swords upon thy country, As did the champion of Corioli!â What lets, but I see justice done upon thee, As Marius did upon his nobler boy? Favon. Bowels of flint, inclosed in frost indissoluble! You have burst my heart stringsâtorn the bleeding band Of kindly nature, the dear tender cords Of father and of child!âWhy, be it so!â Henceforth, I cast all duty to the winds, To the wild winds, to perish on the rocks, Or freeze in Zembla!âO, adieu for ever! [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. The House of Fabius. Fabius enters. Fab. What, vanish'd all!âWhere are my servants, ho! Who waits? A Domestic enters. Dom. My Lord! Fab. Where is your mistress? Dom. Sir, your brother, the Great Pontiff, led our lady, Valeria, and Lavinia, to the Templeâ And left us to deplore the sad event! [Retires. SCENE V. Terentia enters. Fab. Terentia, welcome!âyou are much a stranger!â I sent for you this morning. Come to my arms, TerentiaâIf report Be verified, I shame to see you, sister!â Teren. What report, my Lord? Fab. My friend, Tubero, Seized by a fatal illness, sent, in haste, To beg a parting interviewâmeanwhile, The Pontiff, and my wife, took our Lavinia, To fix her in the Temple of dread Vesta. Teren. He dare not do itâthough he were invested With all the powers of all the magistrates That overbear the state! Lavinia is A flight above the soaring of a Pontiffâ She is Patrician, the first blood in Romeâ A strain that rises o'er the loftiest wing Of the Valerii! Fab. Wherefore this, Terentia? Teren. Because I know, my Lord, that your Lavinia, The flower of Latium's garden, the fair sum Of nature's sweets, Heaven's highest finish'd work, Is your own childâ The noblest offspring of the noblest line Of the most honour'd Fabii! Fab. Thou art frantic! Teren. No! I shall quickly solve this short enigma. Soon after my fair sister, your Lavinia, Blest your fond arms, and your friend Marcellus Receiv'd me to his bosom, you were both Summon'd to war, and left us pregnant: I Brought forth a son, and your beloved Lavinia A daughter. Fab. How? Teren. Be patient, yet, my Lord!â We lived together then. My lovely sister Had often heard your strong and ardent wishes, That you might have a son, who should inherit The fame and virtues of your line.âLavinia, Fond to indulge the wishes of her Fabius, Proposed a change of children.âI assented, And took your infant daughter to my breast; While, on your famed re-entry into Rome, Lavinia gave to your triumphant arm My little Fabius. Know you this character? [Produces a tablet. Upon her latest couch, your parting angel Gave me this tablet; and requested me, When time or sudden exigence required, To yield it to your hands. Fab. It is, it is Her precious character!âTo my lips, firstâ My heartâand, in my spirit, Rest for ever! [Pressing the tablet to his lips and bosom. Celestial creature, O, divine Lavinia! To what hast thou abandon'd thy fond Fabiusâ Fallen from his state of highest bliss, to dwell With endless altercation? Teren. Read, my Lord, Pray read! The dying Lavinia to her Fabius, âLet my Lord pardon a once pleasing imposition; and take to his arms my true and living daughter, for the dead Fabius, son of my sister Terentia.â She is, she is my ownâmy heart foreknew itâ My child, my child Lavinia!âwhere, where is she?â O, I remember now!âWhere are ye all? Servants enter. Fly to the Temple! bid Julia instant home, Or never meet the sight of Fabius more! [Exeunt Servants. Teren. Your wish is gratify'dâ She comes, my Lord.â SCENE VI. Julia and Valeria enter. Fab. Where have you left Lavinia? Julia. In the Temple. Fab. By whose decree? Julia. Your own, this very morning, If she held future commerce with Favonius. Fab. Madam, you must not forward my decree, Without my privity.âReturn and bring her! Julia. She is already consecrateâI cannotâ Nor would I, if I could! Fab. How! Julia. I say, I would not! Fab. Where are the keys? Valeria. Ah, sir! what mean you by that question?âSure You would not, in a start of blinded passion, You would not fix dishonour on my mother, By a divorce? Julia. Go, foolish girl!âdivorce?â Yesâwhen he chuses to divorce my fortunes, The pomp and high alliance which I brought him, And be again the mate of poverty! Valeria. Restrain yourself, my mother! Fab. Where are the keys? Julia. The servant has themâ Junia! Servant enters. Serv. My lady! Julia. Our master wants the keys. [Delivers the keys to Julia. Hereâwill you have them?âThink better!âhaply, I may not, suddenly, be in the humour To take them back again. Fab. Resign the keys. [As Fabius offers to take the keys, Valeria interposes. Valeria. Good my Lord, patience!âMy honour'd mother, Make due submission! Fab. Your proud brother, too, Was in this businessâthe imperious Pontiffâ His dignities ill-suited!âHe shall feel The power of him he dares to injure thus!â I wish he were removed for ever! Julia. He shall know your wish. Fab. Do me that pleasureâI abjure ye all, The wealth-exalted, self-important race Of the Valerii!âGive me up the keys! Julia. You will not, dare not take themâthe acceptance Will crush you into nothing!âThroughout Rome, Five hundred years have told not five divorces!â You dare not fasten such disgrace upon me! Fab. Yesâlet it fix, a badge upon the pride Of your imperious overbearing house! Give me my keys!âI will send back your dower, With added trashâa cheap and glad exchange For the dear treasure of domestic quiet! Julia. EnoughâI yield them, thus!â [Dashing them on the floor. Yet know, lost man, I loved theeâby the gods, I loved thee, Fabius! Come away, girl!â [Exeunt Julia and Valeria. Fab. Goâcall her back!â Yet, tarryâlet her pass! SCENE VII. Enter Favonius. Favon. Justice, great Fabius!âthou, who art renown'd For more than justiceâfor the soul of honourâ For the kind meltings of humanity! Fab. Cimbrius!â I would do much to serve the hope of Rome, The hope and honour of my country!âBut Thy father hath wrong'd Fabiusâgreatly wrong'd him!â Soon we convene the Senate, to resolve Whether a virgin, a free citizen, The daughter of a senatorial house, The last surviving offspring of their Fabius, Rent from my arms, and my protecting roof, Shall be detained with daring violation! Favon. Our wrongs, like our complaints, uniteâI am robb'd Of my dear plighted bride; and you, my lord, Of your adopted daughter! Fab. Adoptedâsayst thou?â Far nearer than adoptedâmy own offspring! SCENE VIII. Terentia enters. Terentia will confirm it. Favon. Terentia?â O my kind hostess, give me still your friendship! Terent. Thou son of glory, of Terentia's soulâ Come to my aged arms! [Embraces him. You owe, my lord, This youth, far more than language can express, Or gratitude repay!â His unexampled prowess saved our child From utter loss, from brutal violation. Fab. Spite of the hated race from whence thou'rt sprung, Thy virtues, Cimbrius, have endear'd thee to me! Favon. O, then, confirm the vows of my Lavinia! Fab. I do, before the gods!âUpon the morrow, The Senate shall restore me to my child, And you to yourâ Favon. Alas, my lord! to-morrow She may be past recall!âthis present night, This hour, secure the giftâthis very instant! Could I find means to bear her to the camp, She were my own, against the world in arms! Fab. Then, take thy wishâCome to my cabinetâ And to thy glory may the gods add peace!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Street near the Temple. Valerius enters, attended by Heralds, Officers, and Soldiers. Valer. Go, rouse our senatorsâ [To the Heralds. Convene them instantly!âWe have been told There is commotion in the camp to-night. Dispatch an officer and band of soldiers [To the chief Captain. To every gate, and double its assurance! Pretors! divide the city watch, and place A guard at every avenueâwhile the rest Patrole the streets, to seize on all suspected. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The Inside of the Temple. Lavinia reading by a TaperâShe rises. Lavin. How still, how peaceful, all around!âO death, If such is thy asylumâso I might Shake off these thoughts, these inward perturbations, In thy dark mansionâO, how pleased I would, This instant, lay me in thine icey arms, Shut out the glare and bustle of the world, And sink into my long, long sleep!â [Part of the Copy is wanting here.] SCENE III. Lavin. By what enchantment could you enter here?â Favon. Strong love can force a way thro' all obstructions. Lavin. Ah me! I fearâI tremble for your safety! Do you not know to what a horrid death, Painful as ignominious, you are doom'd, Should you be found?âFor me, it matters notâ With hope all fear has vanish'd! Favon. Heavenly maid! I come not here without due warrantânoâ Credentials of high import!âKnow you not The character of Fabius? [Delivers the contract, and the tablet. Of your late mother too? Lavin. Alas!âwhat say you?â Terentia dead!â Favon. No, noâyou are the daughter Of Fabius and Lavinia!âRead the tablet. [She reads. Lavin. Yes, nature vouch'd it!âI may well believe, I was her offspringâher acts, her accents, Her looks that hung with such endearment o'er me, Confess'd her all the motherâwhile my grief That would not have survived her, proved the child! Favon. Come love, the season wanesâlet us escape! Your father wakes to bless youâand my legions Are all impatient to behold you! Lavin. How!â Shall I, whom Cimbrius honours with his hand, Bring infamy on both? Favon. Wealth of my soul, there's no alternativeâ To-morrow cannot save you from destruction! The tyrant Pretor, the remorseless Pontiff, Is absolute in Rome.âThe noble Fabius, Commits you wholly unto my protection. Lavin. But then, the fearful hazard of our flight!â Favon. Not far from hence, there waits a chosen band Of faithful followersâevery life among them Devoted to your safetyâCome!â Lavin. O Junius!â By that loved name I knew you firstâI swear, My life, my fame itself is yoursâthis moment I would with pleasure yield them, willing victims Or to your peace, or honour!âYet, I know notâ My heart, my heart misgives me!âBut, go on!â Surely the guardian powers of truth and innocence Are with us, and around us!â [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The noise of a gate burst open is heard; and Domestics enter in alarm. 1st Dom. The southern gate is forcedâsome votary fled!â 2d Dom. Send for the PontiffâAlarm the city!â [Exeunt. SCENE V. Favonius and Lavinia re-enter. Favon. Prevented thus, we try another way, For noise and violence are not our friends. Guards without. Guard. Stand, sir!âyou pass not here!â Favon. Nay, then I must!â [Draws his sword. Fear not, Lavinia!âfollow closely on, Where I make way, undaunted! Lavin. Yes, my hero, Through life and death I follow, to partake The fate of him I love! SCENE VI. The Guards give way at the assault of Favoniusâ Valerius advances with his sword drawn. Favon. My father here!âO Heavens! I must not shed a father's blood!â Valer. Disarm this traitor to his country's peace! [The Guards seize and disarm Favonius. Favon. Give me my sword again!âI had forgotâ O my lost love, Lavinia, I have betrayed thee! [Casts off, and struggles with the Guards. Valer. Hold, hold him firm!âCall in the second watch, [More enter. To keep this raging lion in the toils. Prepare the seats of justice!â By the dread sword and scales of chaste AstrÃ¦a, We will not stir till we have tried these criminals! [Seats brought in. Inferior Pontiffs enter. Lavinia, we do grieve to see a virgin, Of senatorial rank, and fair repute, Break from her consecrated sphere of duty, And with her minion stroll the streets of Rome At such an hour as this. Lavin. At any hour, To 'scape the hard oppression of a tyrant. Valer. You have a better pleaâthis traitor here, 'Tis he who has seduced you! Lavin. Romans, no!â He is no seducer! He is at once the glory and eclipse Of his degraded kin, degraded country! This sun of brightness has no spot, no blemishâ Save that he is the offspring of Valerius! [Valerius and inferior Pontiffs take their seats. Favonius, stand before us!âYou do need No plea, young man, for I am seated here Not as your judge, but fatherânot for trial, But sentence absolute.âAttach him, lictors!â Bind, bind him!âharder yet!â Now take him to the dungeon's deepest cavern! Favon. O, unknown Father both of gods and men! Is this my triumph?âYet, 'tis thy decreeâ Make me to triumph in it! [Exit with Lictors. Valer. Now to a task, Far, far more grievous, than the condemnation Of my own child!âLavinia, come before us! You stand impeached, for that in violation Of duty to great Jove and awful Vesta, You did by night depart the sacred Fane, To whose dread goddess thou wast consecrate. Lavin. I do not know by what authority Of gods or men, the criminal should sit In judgment o'er the party he has injuredâ I therefore shall not plead at your tribunal! But as my soul knows not a single thought To closet from the world, I do avow, To these free men of Rome, I did depart The place in which your rapine had immured me. Valer. Record her free confession! Lavin. 'Tis confess'dâ I did depart my prison, to restore A free born Roman to the Commonwealth, A free born daughter to the longing arms Of a fond father; that by deeds of justice, I might undo the deeds of violence, Of stern oppression! Valer. You stand here, Lavinia, Not to charge others, but defend yourself! And then you take no note, in your strong pleadings, Of your associate, ladyâthe Endymion, With whom, like wandering Dian, you have put Your honour in eclipse! Lavin. O Romans, hear himâ This base detractor!âwho, not satisfied With having rent me from the noble stock Of my great ancestors, proceeds to strike At my immortal fame, my life of honour! But ye beheld the associateâthe Endymion, With whom your cruel Pontiff would reproach meâ He is the very man, to whose protection My noble father, Fabius, did consign me, Under his signet here! Valer. And could your father Consign you to the heir of the Valerii? Write downââConfess'dâeloped, by her consent, âWith her inamorato.â Lavin. I appeal To gods and men, the Senate and the peopleâ To the free people of the state of Rome, I here make my appeal! Valer. Lavinia, Rome, Senate and people, have consigned, to me, Their great palladium, their Eternal Fire, With all the rites and sanctions of their worship, Without appeal!âLictors, bring forth the levers, And raise the lid of death!âI'll not depart, Till, by the justice of our laws, I see thee Inhumed alive! Lavin. Where are ye, Romans?âO, there was a time, When such a deed as this had overthrown Your tyrants to the dust!âwhen such a trespass On Lucrece, on Virginia, blew to flames The smother'd embers of expiring Liberty, And cast the Tarquins and Decemvirs forth To banishment, to death! SCENE VII. Fabius enters, attended by a few Romans. Fab. How!âsentenced, say you?âWhere is my injured child?â Lord Pretor, I do claim a private conference With this, my only offspring, my lost daughter! Valer. Granted.âThough Fabius is no more our brother, Lavinia is his child. [Fabius embraces Lavinia in silence. Lavin. Alas, my father! Why are you here?âyour presence has debased me! Had you not come, I had confronted death, As would become a Romanâa true daughter Of the immortal Fabii! Fab. O, my child!â Altho' three hundred of our line, at once, Have fallen in Rome's defenceâ Altho' unpillar'd by the Fabian prowess, She had not been a nameâ In vain have I implored the torpid Senateâ The frost of their hoar heads has reach'd their hearts! Nor will they interfere in sacred rites! Lavin. Retire, my father! And leave me to support, the best I may, The honour of our house! Fab. Alas, alas! How can your tender frame bear up, when mine, My veteran heart, once arm'd to all events, Sinks into infancy! O, you know not What they prepare!âa simple death were nothing!â But I have brought my child a sure relief, Tho' a sad present from a father's hand!â If, in the during dark that shall surround thee, Your thoughts should turn to horror, or to frenzy, Not sufferableâtake this cordial, love! It will, as when you sink to peaceful sleep, Give your pure soul to Heaven. Lavin. I thank, I thank My bless'd physician! Now I dare their utmost! Fab. O then farewell!âfarewell, my child, my child! I shall not tarry hereâfor life, already, Is gone with my Lavinia! [Embracing. Lavin. Till we do meet In blissâfarewell, my father! Fab. List, proud Pontiffâ Now list, Valerius!âI do prophecy, Shortly the boasted name of the Valerii, Shall not be heard in RomeâBut that is nothing.â Guilt, general guilt, an all diffusing cloud, Shall cover earth and heaven!âthe Patriot-light, That, like the galaxy, the etherial way, Spread from the common fire of mutual virtue, Commingling blaze with blaze, shall be extinct! Scarce a few glimmering stars shall then appear, Throughout Rome's darken'd hemisphere, till all Shall sink in undistinguish'd ruin!âLo, Proud-propertied, flint-hearted, thankless Rome!â To Nether Jove, and all the Infernal gods, I here devote thee! [Exit. Valer. He's frantic, let him on!âDraw near, Lavinia! Thou seest the dread devouring gulph lies openâ Thou seest thy pains or pardon, life or death, Are in my mandate.âHadst thou, now, the offer, Either to famish in yon fearful cavern, Circled with horrors and eternal darkness, Or take the noble comfort I have providedâ What were thy option? Lavin. Patienceâlet me ponder!â To dieâto lose the sense of light and life, Perhaps for everâfearful!ânature shrinks, She shudders at the thought!âBut then again, To break the faith, that gratitude, that love Must still avow through life, and yield my self To loathed embraces!âhorrible, most horrible!â No, subtle tempter!âthou who wouldst ensnare My soul in such a length of guilt and misery, Hasten thy deadly sentenceâI am ready! Valer. Bring in her loaf and pitcher!âlet her take Her own election! SCENE VIII. Valeria enters attended. Valeria. Where's my Lord Pretor?âO, dread tidings! Valer. What? Valeria. My mother heard Favonius and Lavinia Had 'scaped the Templeâwhen, with sudden passion, She blacken'd and expired! Valer. Most dreadfulâyet, how natural, thus to close The tenor of a life for ever vehement! Valeria. Ah, what a scene is here!âFor whom, I pray, This fearful apparatus?âHow!âLavinia!â O, Lamb of Peace! art thou the sacrifice, These savages intend? Lavin. Indeed, my sister, You timely came to take a last embrace! My arms are openâyou were ever gentle, [They embrace. And precious to my nature.âCan you pardon The involuntary sorrows which I caused you? My sister, pardon me!âThis hapless barrier Will quickly be removed!â Valeria. Not so, not soâ I could not bear it; I should sleep no more!â Curst be the hour in which imperious parents Thrust me between your loves!âMy Lord, my uncle, My only parent now, have mercy!âMark, I yield himâyour contested hero!âI Restore him to his blessedness, this dove Of Heaven, his just election! Valer. Off, weak girl!â Wouldst thou intrude between the gods, and me Their substitute?âYour office, lictors!âDown, Down with the ladder and the short lived lamp! Valeria. Yet stay.âI will not part her!âBy the gods Celestial and infernal, I'll not part her! LaviniaâI have no mother nowâno love, But thee, my sister!âspight of selfish jars, And love wrought-jealousies, thou ever wert The chosen of my heartâthroughout the world My chiefest good!âleave me not now!âCome lictors, And bury us together! Lavin. Ah, Valeria! I give thee placeâthou hast deserved the laurel! I now perceive my veryest littleness In thy uprising.âO, may Favonius Behold you with my eyes!âand, when you are blest, Seated in pleasing intercourse together, If your Lavinia's name should chance to come Amid your converse, drop a pitying tear, And take her spirit to your circle!âAh! My sister's pale!âher breath comes quick and faintly! Support her!âbear her hence!âI cannot want, At this tremendous hour, a further weight To sink me! [Valeria is taken away. Valer. On, Lavinia! Lavin. Yes, my Lord, Exalted as the conqueror on his car; Meek as the lamb, when laid upon the altar!â O Maker of my Junius! if these worlds, As he affirms, are all thy doingsâif Thou art, Thyself, the beauty of thy works, Grace to the eye, and music to the ear, Thrilling the soul to raptureâif Thou art The heart's sweet prompter, tuning all its cords To goodnessâO preserve the soul Thou hast given!â Though now I die to all things else, Blest Power, Still let me live to Thee! [Lavinia descendsâThe iron cover is replaced, and the scene closes. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Prison. Valeria and Jailor enter. Jail. Soon as your uncle, lady, knows this trespass, My head must pay the forfeit. Valeria. Fear it notâ I will remain your prisoner in his place, And answer, head for head!âThis, with my thanks. [Gives a purse. SCENE II. The Jailor opens the back scene, and discovers Favonius asleep, in irons, and stretched on straw. Valeria. O hero!âis it here that thou reposest After the toils of battle?âFaithless Rome! How oft are dungeons, banishment, or death, The portion of thy bravest patriots, And bonds the lot of those who bring thee freedom! He sleeps!âA virtue like to his, finds peace In chains and darkness.âTo your office, hands! To your blest office! [Kneels and unbinds Favonius. Ah, what hand or heart Could fasten shackles on these limbs? Favon. Who's there? Valeria. A friend!â A hapless, tho' a very tender friend, To Lord Favonius! Favon. Do I dream?âValeria! What would thy softness with these midnight horrors?â This is no placeâ Valeria. It is, it is a palace, For Cimbrius is in it! Favon. Hast thou learn'd Aught of Lavinia, my fair cousin? Valeria. Therefore, 'Tis therefore I am come. Favon. Ah! what of her?â Valeria. Inhumed, imprison'd, darker, deeper far, Than thou art! Favon. O stern father of the fiends! Valeria. Haste, thenâyour chains are loosedâthe gates are openâ Away to the relief of your beloved! Force up the iron gate of living burial, And bear your bride far hence!âRome is no place No seat for love or virtue like to that Of Cimbrius and Lavinia! Favon. Let me gaze!â Is it Valeria, then, who would unite Favonius to Lavinia? Valeria. Yes two theyâ Make my whole wealth, my sum of joy on earth!â If I do know my heart aright, I think, When they are bless'd, I cannot be unhappy! Favon. Virtue, Virtue, Thou art femaleâman knows nothing of thee!â O maid beloved, adored, dear to my heart! Dearer than life, or aught, save my Lavinia! Too vast the weight of this superior greatness!â Till we do meet again in peaceâfarewell! [Embrace. Valeria. Perhaps, for ever!âO, farewell for ever! [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Near the Cavern. Fabius and Terentia enter. Fab. Come, my sad sister!âIt is, surely, hereâ Or near this spot!âThe heart would fain approach Where lodge its treasures!âIt was said of old, That ghosts thus haunt our charnelsâand beneath The doubtful glimpses of the dreary moon, Oft glance athwart, or hover round the place Where their pale bodies lie! Teren. O Fabius, Fabius! Are ours the only heads, on which the gods Should pour forth all their vengeance? Fab. No, Terentia! 'Tis the known lot of lifeâthe brightest day Of frail mortality must pass in clouds, And sink in everlasting night! Teren. But O, Our rose of Latium's garden, that dispensed Nothing but sweets around!âin what could she Offend the gods, that they should tear so sudden Her fragrance from the root? Fab. O, the fell Pontiff! the stern wretch, Valerius! I only hold in life till I have vengeance.â Teren. Hark! what groan was that?âAgain!â Do you not hear it?â Fab. Noâ'tis fancy! Teren. List!â Methought it were the accent of Lavinia, Mournfully musical! Fab. Do you not hear A distant trampling?âNearer, now! Teren. Yes, as of many feet. Fab. What can it mean?âat this dead hour!âThey come!â Let us retire, and mark them. [Exeunt Fabius and Terentia. SCENE IV. Valerius enters with his Followers, some bearing levers and a ladder. Valer. The chariot, and your horsesâ Are they in readiness? Serv. They are, my Lord! Valer. Go some of you, and raise the ponderous cover! That done, let down the steps, and wait my coming! [Part of the Attendants go out with the ladder and levers. Lucius and Servius, now mark my orders!â Soon as the lady is restored to light, With all due reverence and observant tenderness, Convey her to the chariotâthen take horse, With your attendants, and pass gently onwards To the Flaminian gateâthence on with speed, Till you have reached my fortress on the frontier, Where I will meet you. Lucius. In every point, my Lord, We shall be most observant. Valer. Ha!âwhat lights are yon?â And at this hour? Serv. They seem, my Lord, to bend This way, and with a numerous company. Valer. Curs'd chance!âI would not, for ten provinces, Be noted in this businessâRetire awhile, Till they have pass'd!â Amazement!âstopâFavonius, Favonius in the van!âhis fetters off!

Drusus, ho!â Tidings of life, or death?â Drus. Of life, my general!â Favon. O gods!â [Favonius falls back some steps. Lavin. Do I once more behold the light?â [Lavinia appears. Favonius! Favon. Lavinia! [They rush to each others arms, and embrace for some time in silence. Lavin. Blest spirit of my heart! Do I revive to thee?âAy, that, indeed, That is to live to happiness, to rapture! Favon. Now, as the gods are good, I do not know If that they rightly have assured my senses, To bear this blessedness!âThe tide of blood That lately sunk my heart, now pours abroad In such a torrent, as is like to bear My very frame before it!âO Lavinia! Speak to me, Love! relieve me from my doubts Of the transcendency of such a joy, As never was the lot of mortal!âsay, Do I indeed then see thee, hear thee, hold thee?â Lavinia, art thou, at the last, all mine?â Lavin.

No, no, my treasure!âby kind Heaven's decree, At length thou art mine, and earth shall never part us! Fear not; for this time we have been providentâ The gate of the Janiculum lies open To our escape; my soldiers fill the pass; And, though all Rome should rise upon the heels Of my stern father, we do set them all At broad defiance!â SCENE VI. Fabius and Terentia enter. They stand a while in mute astonishment. Fab. My child! Teren. My soul's begotten! Lavin. O my father!â [Embrace. My mother, tooâstill mother of Lavinia!â Do we then meet again?âThe guardian powers Are bounteous beyond bearing! Fab. O my daughter! To have thee thus restored, above all hope, To my enfolding arms, enfolding heartâ It is, as if, upon a second birth, I clasped thee to my bosom, as the sole Sole hope of new existence!âPardon, hero, Deliverer of thy country!âdearer yet, Deliverer of the Fabii, in this gem Of all their opulence! [Embrace. Favon. My lord, my father!â Henceforth I am a Fabius! I renounce All other terms of honour or alliance!â But, sir, 'tis time we partâshould this be rumour'd, Some obstacle may rise; and I would spare The blood of Romans!âwe shall meet again, I trust, and shortly!âO, my noblest father! My honour'd mother, too!âtill then, farewell! [Embrace. Come, Love!â Lavin. Stay yetâa littleâsomewhat checks me!â The joy, I think, of this extatic meetingâ It has o'erpower'd me!â Favon. Ah, your lustre wanes!â What can this mean?â Fab. Alas!âperhaps, my child, You've taken of that opiate which I gave you. Lavin. Not much.â Fab. Haste, fly Terentia! bring the antidoteâ You'll find it on the left within my cabinetâ A crystal phial squared!âThese veteran wounds Have left me slow of pace! [Exit Terentia. Favon. Your colour comes again!âHow fares my blessing? Lavin. I feel, as I grew wearyâ [She sitsâFavonius and Fabius support her on each side, kneeling on one knee. Fab. O, that fatal drug!âe'er I had given it, Would that kind death had closed my miseries! Lavin. Not so, my father! In truth I took but littleâI am not pained, But weak and faintly breathed!âO my Favonius! Favon. Mirrour of sweetness!âAh, with what a force That eager look has seized upon my heart, And tears the strings of life! Lavin. My love!âmy Junius!â I should be loth to leave you.âThus to part!â To leave the world were nothing! Favon. Speak not of it!â The very thought freezes the fount of life, And shudders through my veins!â Lavin. My father, too!â Fab. Courage, my Love!ârelief will soon arrive. Lavin. I doubtâI doubt!â Fab. Alas, my child is lost! Lavin. Holdâhold me to ye both!âLet me not part ye!â Yet closer!â A swimming kind of darkness comes upon me, And drinks remembrance up!âI goâI go!â I know notâOh, farewell!â [Dies. SCENE VII. Fabius sits, Lavinia's head leaning on his lap. Favonius rises, steps back, and stands in fixed, though wild astonishment.âValerius enters with his party. Valer. Dead!âdead, Lavinia!âthen our day is done, And the world's work at stand!âYou may retireâ [To his Attendants. No further way on earth remains to travel! Favon. Hush!â Wake not my Love!âBehold, how sweet she sleeps, Fann'd by the hovering doves!âand smiles and dreams Of her Favonius! How, how is this!âa corse put in her place! So pale!âso pale and breathless!â Villain! 'tis thou who hast done this! [Seizes his Father. Valer. Yes, strike!â It is my wish!âI am ready! Favon. Ha!âmy father!â What fiend has arm'd my hand against a father?â My brain! my brain!âthe seat of memory Quite overthrown!âand yet some cause!âO, now I recollectâI had, I think, a father!â Sir, do you know my father? Valer. Too well! too well! Favon. He was a noble father, had his heart Been made of aught but iron!âSure my heart Is not of ironâfor it weeps to think, He ever had a child! Valer. Alas, alas! Favon. Wilt bear a message to him? Valer. Yes, most faithfully! Favon. Bid him not fearâtell him I cannot kill him!â But some wayâsome wayâhe must do me justice!â He would not let me have a child to sport withâ 'Tis then but right, that, in returnâthusâthusâ I leave him childless! [Stabs himself, and falls dead without a groan. Valer. O my son, my son!â Then all is ended! [Falls. Fab. Wretched Valerius! thou art fallen, indeedâ Beneath my vengeanceâto compassion fallen!â O pair of priceless pearlsâyou two have left The world to beggary! short was your course, But swift, and full of virtue!âLo, vain man, How thou dost build for happiness!âIn clouds, Thou layest thy corner stoneâthe pleasing structure Rises in pride, and promises to lift Its pinacles to Heavenâthen comes a blast, A sudden blast, and sweeps away the fabric, With all its builders!âVirtue, Virtue only, Can out-last frail mortalityâcan reach To other worldsâa future life ensureâ And raise, on death, the Pile that stands for ever!</field>
