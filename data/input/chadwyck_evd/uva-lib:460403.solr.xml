      <field name="fulltext">Scene near Artaxata, the capital of Armenia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A deep stony valley, surrounded by rocks and shaded with thick trees. Rhadamistus asleep upon a rock, Zopyrus observing him with attention. Zop. O! no, I am not deceiv'd, 'tis Rhadamistus: How favouring stars have answer'd to my wishes! I have long pursued his steps; and chance has now Expos'd him to my arm, immers'd in sleep, Alone in this sequester'd part. Neglect not The gift that Fortune offersâLet him die: This even his father bids; he hates in him The rival of his throne, and I, in him, The rival of my loveâThen let me serve My vengeance and my king. [about to draw his sword. Rhad. [dreaming.] Leave me in peace. Zop. He wakes! malicious fate!âWe must dissemble. Rhad. Leave me in peace, O! ever honour'd shade! [waking. Zop. Almighty powers! [seeming not to have seen him before. Rhad. My stars! what do I see! Zop. Ha! Rhadamistus! Rhad. Art thou Zopyrus? [rising. Zop. O! prince! thy country's boast, the care of Heaven, Belov'd of Asia and thy faithful Zopyrus; And is it given me once again to see thee? O! let me on that royal hand impress A thousand times the kiss of loyalty. Rhad. What evil chance has led thy feet to tread These horrid rocks, which scarce the sun has known? Zop. I fly the rage of impious Pharasmanes. Rhad. Guard more thy speech: remember he's thy king, And Rhadamistus' fatherâSay, what crime Seeks he in thee to punish? Zop. This alone, That I am friend to you. Rhad. Alas! 'tis just; All, all should now abhor meâI confess it. O! I'm an object hateful to the living, And hateful to myself. Zop. Not so, my lord, You are unhappy, but not criminal; I know your cruel fortune. Rhad. Little sure Thou know'st my fatal story. Zop. Yes, I know That all Armenia rose in arms, and deem'd In you they view'd the murderer of their king. But well I know, that from your father came The blow in secret dealt; that he with art Transferr'd the guilt to youâZenobia tooâ Rhad. O! ceaseâ Zop. And why, my prince? Rhad. With that dear name Thou stabb'st my soul. Zop. But late she was your joy. I'm not to learn you sought her hand in marriage. Rhad. I sought and I obtain'd itâSuch a treasure, Alas! was mineâBut O! ye Gods!â Zop. You weep: Have you then lost her? Speak: where is Zenobia? What fate could e'er divide such happy bands? Rhad. Ah! Zopyrus, she's dead, and died by me. Zop. By you?âJust Gods! and whyâ Rhad. Because the earth Has ne'er produc'd a wretch like Rhadamistus; A monster void of good; because I knew not To curb the mad excess of jealous fury. Zop. I know not what your words intend. Rhad. Then hear: Believ'd a traitor by Armenia's sons In tumult rais'd, thou know'st I was constrain'd But late to fly. Along Araxes' banks I took my course: my lov'd Zenobia then (Too virtuous consort!) would with me partake My toil and peril; but her tender frame To these unequal prov'dâBy slow degrees Her strength grew less, and pale and breathless now With tardy steps she follow'd, when the tread Of fierce pursuers, thickening at our heels, Drew near and nearerââO! my much-lov'd lord!â (At length she cried) âI faint! I can no moreâ âSave, save thy life alone; but let thy weapon âFirst pierce this bosom: leave me not expos'd âTo hostile fury.â Think, O! think, my friend, What then was RhadamistusâLost in grief, And frantic with despair, I wept, I rav'd; When, O! my Zopyrus, the fatal moment Was come, when full before my eyes I saw The Parthian Tiridates' banners wave: I saw, I knew him; and that instant banish'd My small remains of reason: then to mind I call'd the loves of him and my Zenobia. Reflection told me all defence was vain To save her from his hands; and cruel fancy Now shew'd my consort in a rival's arms. I trembled, while a sudden chillness crept Through all my veins, and every thought was madness. My tongue refus'd its utterance; night appear'd To cloud the air and veil the troubled sun. Zop. On what could you resolve? Rhad. Furious, distracted, I drew my sword and plung'd it, (Heavenly powers!) Deep in my consort's breast, and next my own: Senseless she sunk within Araxes' stream, While on his banks I stagger'd, reel'd and fell. Zop. Unhappy princess! Rhad. For my punishment, I died not with the wound: the sudden fall Conceal'd me from the foes. At morning light A stranger's pitying hand convey'd me thenceâ âBut thou attend'st not; with disorder'd looks Thou seem'st absorb'd in thought. I know too well What thou would'st sayâThou marvell'st still to see The earth support me; that these savage rocks Fall not in vengeance on my guilty head. Believe that I am punish'd; Heaven is just: The righteous Gods have, for my chastisement, Consign'd me to myself to feel the stings, The cruel stings of late but dire remorse. Zop. [aside.] What shall I do? This arm will not suffice Alone, to take the forfeit of his crimes. Rhad. I know what justice now demands. This hand Should free a passage for my guilty soul: But let me first find out those dear remains; Pay them the last sad rites of sepulture, Then close these eyes in death. Unburied, now Her spirit wanders 'midst these gloomy shades; I see it ever flit before my eyes: I have no peaceâO! let us then, my friend, Depart to seek her. [going. Zop. Hold: for while the foes Enclose us round, the attempt would prove in vain. Here, in this vale, awhile remain conceal'd, And wait for my return: with utmost speed I hasten to pursue the pious search. Rhad. Then be it so. Go, Zopyrus, and thenâ Zop. No more: confide in me, nor quit this place; Expect me soon. Meantime, my prince, compose Your troubled soul, and moderate your sorrows. Think what you owe yourself: forget that face, And from remembrance rase the once-lov'd name. Rhad. Fain would I, Zopyrus, take thy friendly council, But O! what power can drive her image hence? Ah! why, when fated to sustain The loss of all we love below, Must recollection still remain To keep alive a cureless woe? When grief is vain the afflicted mind Will prize the blessing once our own; And each neglected good we find Then more, by loss, severely known. [Exit. SCENE II. Zopyrus alone. Alas! Zenobia, all my hopes are vanish'dâ Yes, tyrant, thou shalt meet thy due reward. Soon, with my trusty friends, not far conceal'd, I'll hasten to return and glut my vengeance, And from its bosom tear thy treacherous heart. The wretch shall fall with gasping breath, And struggling in the pangs of death, Shall view the hand by which he dies. Let him but fall: let PhÅbus' light For me be chang'd to endless night, So day to him its beam denies. [Exit. SCENE III. An open country watered by the river Araxes: on one side are pastoral cottages, and on the other side the view is terminated by a range of pleasant hills. At the foot of the nearest hill is a rustic grotto, the entrance almost covered with ivy and shrubs. At a distance beyond the river is seen the royal city of Artaxata, with a magnificent bridge leading to it. The Parthian army encamped by the river. Enter Zenobia and Ãgle from one of the cottages. Zen. No, gentle Ãgle, seek not to attend Zenobia's steps: I must not now permit thee. A wretched fugitive, who knows, alas! Where fate may lead me next? Should I receive thee To share my dangers, ill must I repay The goodness of thy heart; enough already Thy kindness has been shewn: let this suffice. Twice have I liv'd by thee: thy pity drew me From the swift eddies of Araxes' tide: My wounded bosom by thy care was heal'd: I found a sweet asylum in thy cottage, And thou to me wert comforter and friend, Companion and adviser: leaving thee, My loss is more than thine. Thou must not hence; In this thou hast no will: thy duty here Detains thee near an aged father; mine Commands me to pursue a husband lost: Our several duties claim us eachâFarewell. Ãgl. But thus alone, without a guide, to trace These savage woodsâSuch courage in a woman Is surely wondrous. Zen. Long I've been inur'd To every trial. From my earliest age I learn'd to suffer: thrice five years are past Since, once before, Armenia's rebel sons Constrain'd my flight; and then, alas! I lost A dear and infant sister, ravish'd from me; Or happier, she amidst the tumult perish'd, While I still live reserv'd for endless woes. Ãgl. And would'st thou, midst such peril, thus pursue A cruel husband's steps? Zen. More kindly name A hero fam'd for every royal virtue. Ãgl. Is jealous fury then a royal virtue? Zen. Say, who is perfect? Let us learn to pardon The faults of others while we view our own. Ãgl. To slay his wife!â Zen. Involuntary crimes We call not guilt.âAlas! in such a state My Rhadamistus was no more himself, But, urg'd by sudden frenzy, rais'd his weapon. Not Rhadamistus then assail'd Zenobia: Not love, but fury struck; nor saw he then The victim of his momentary rage. Ãgl. O! generous dame! permit me now to seek For tidings of your spouse, while you remainâ Zen. No, dearest Ãgle, noâit must not be. My longer tarriance here would risk too far Zenobia's fame and virtue. Ãgl. How, Zenobia? Zen. Full well I know thou little canst conceive What mean my words: then hear, and truly say If fear in me is blame. The youthful leader Of yonder squadrons, which thou see'st encamp'd, Is Tiridates, brother to the king Who sways the Parthian sceptre. Never yet The Gods have form'd a prince who better claim'd The love of all: a spirit more exalted, A form more graceful, or of gentler manners. I lov'd him, and was lov'd, (without a blush I may confess a passion since subdued) He wish'd, he sought my hand: my father gladly Receiv'd his suit, but Rhadamistus then With him contended for Zenobia's faith; And hence the king, my father, urg'd my lover To seek for succour from his royal brother, Of arms and warriors: strengthen'd thus against His rival's force, to seek Armenia's court, And tie th' expected knot. He parted thence, And I remain'd. I tremble, while remembrance Recalls that mournful parting: well my heart Presag'd in that, alas! our last farewell. While anxious, restless still, my ardent vows Would hasten his return, one day my father Declar'd, (O! death to hear!) he wish'd me now The wife of Rhadamistus; that a cause Of high import had chang'd his former purpose; That my refusal would expose to peril His peace, his throne, his dignity and life. What could I do, a subject and a daughter? I wept, deplor'd my fate, and begg'd to die; But I obey'd; nor was my hand alone Given at his will: I gain'd a mightier conquest, And moulded my affections to his choice: With honour's ties I fortified my virtue, And sacrific'd the lover to the wife. Ãgl. And saw you never Tiridates more? Zen. Forbid it all ye powers! This fear alone Now drives me hence; not that I doubt myself: No, Ãgle, no; I feel Zenobia's soul By reason measures every thought and deedâ My victory is certain; but the struggle Is dreadful in extreme: we must not less Avoid the shew of guilt than guilt itself. A woman's fame is like the crystal, soil'd With every touch; or like the feeble reed, That bends with every blast. Ãgl. Unhappy prince! What must he feel at such heart-breaking news? Zen. To him 'tis yet unknown. A secret marriage United Rhadamistus' fate with mine; And Tiridates to the promis'd nuptials Return'd unconscious of th' event. Ãgl. O! Heavens! To find Armenia rous'd to general tumult; The throne now vacant and the monarch slain, And all his hopes destroy'd!âZenobia tooâ Zen. To find Zenobia in another's arms. Ãgl. O! cruel destiny! Zen. Now say, my friend, Can I expose my constancy to view The grief of such a prince; of one so lov'd? Of one who merits all? Who, when he hears This heart is made another'sâO! farewell. Ãgl. And will you leave me? Zen. Yes, my dearest Ãgle, I fly this place, for danger threatens here; A thousand thoughts, a thousand kind memorialsâ Ãgl. And whom can harmless pity wrong? Zen. Alas! The snares of guileful pity must be fear'd: Farewell! one kind embrace and rest in peace. Ah! rest in peace, on all thy days May stars propitious shine; Nor dart on them malignant rays, As now they dart on mine. Thou well may'st render thanks to Heaven, Thus born in humble state: O! might it e'er to me be given, To change for thine my fate! [Exit. SCENE IV. Ãgle alone. Unhappy princess! how my bosom feels For all her pains! A simple shepherdess, Poor and unknown, to thee is cause of envy! Ah: what are Fortune's gifts? And what avails To toil for these, if when Heaven frowns upon us, These gifts so ill defend the fond possessors? Though Indian seas rich gems disclose, Not gentler there the current flows, Nor more serene the skies. The land that least will fear the power Of ocean's tide, where tempests roar, Is some lone bay, whose quiet shore The distant wind defies. [Exit. SCENE V. Zenobia alone, searching round the stage. O! Rhadamistus! whither art thou gone? My lord, my husbandâSurely I beheld And close pursued himâMidst these forest paths I've lost all track. That way his feet were bentâ Ah! whither hast thou wander'd, ill-advis'd? These parts are fill'd with Rhadamistus' foes: Preserve him, Gods! in such impending dangers. But what is my design? Shall I proceed? I risk too farâThen let me find out Ãgle, And she shall seekâSuffice, ye cruel stars! Suffice, my wretchedness is now complete. Leave, O! ye pitying powers! O! leave My breast awhile in peace; But if for ever I must grieve, Yet grant a short release. So shall, alas! my wounded mind, Long stranger to repose, At least recruited vigour find To bear redoubled woes. [goes out and returns again. O! wretched me!âBehold from yonder part Where Tiridates comes! Almighty powers! O! how I tremble! All my soul's in tumult! Zenobia, flyâAh! fly this fatal meeting. That hollow cavern in these friendly rocks Shall, while he passes, hide me from his sight. [enters the grotto. SCENE VI. Enter Tiridates. Zenobia in the grotto. Tir. Mithranes not return'd? His long delay Fills me with terrorâBut he comesâAlas! What mean those looks disturb'd? O! haste, my friend, Kill me, or give me comfortâWhere's my love? What tidings hast thou brought? SCENE VII. Enter Mithranes. Mit. Ah, Tiridates! Tir. O Heavens! what cruel silence! SpeakâIs then Zenobia's fate a secret? None can tell What has befallen, or whither fate has driven her? Mit. Alas! too well 'tis known. Tir. O! speak. Mit. She's dead. Tir. O! all ye powers of Heaven! Mit. The wretch who slew The father, took the hapless daughter's life. Tir. What villain?â Mit. Rhadamistus; he, the inhuman, By him Zenobia died. Tir. O! murderous slave! And could he thenâO! no, it cannot be: What heart would not relent at charms like hers? He lov'd her tooâBelieve it not, Mithranes. Mit. Grant Heaven 'twere doubtful! On Araxes' banks He gave the wound, and from the further shore A fisher saw her, with the cruel stroke, Fall in the rapid stream: swift plunging in He swam to give her aid, but all in vain; She sunk beneath the tide, from which he drew Her floating bloody vest. Alas! his tale Admits no gleam of hope; myself beheld Zenobia's vest, and knew it for her own. Tir. Assist me, heavenly powers! Zen. [listening.] O! cruel trial! Tir. The day now fails before my darken'd sight. [leans against a tree. Zen. [apart.] O! give me counsel, Gods! Mit. Be calm, my prince: The mighty Gods such sufferings send to prove A hero's virtue. Tir. Leave me. Mit. Shall I leave you In such a state? How would the world reproach Mithranes' loyal truth? Tir. Depart, depart. Mit. Must I depart? Your mandate still Directs my faithful heart; Obedient to my prince's will, Reluctant I depart. What dire effects from grief may rise, That mines the secret soul, When counsel no relief supplies The danger to control. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Tiridates. Zenobia apart. Tir. Is then Zenobia dead, and does my heart Still cherish life? For whom? What hope can more Attract thee now? What hast thou now to wish? Enjoyments, treasure, pomp, life, honours, all For her were dear. I lose the object now Of all my toils and caresâTo me the world Is lost for ever!âNo, ungrateful stars! [rises. Think not to part me from Zenobia ever: This sword, in your despite, amid the dark Oblivious realm shall join me to my love. [draws his sword. Zen. [coming out of the grotto.] What do I see! Tir. [to himself.] Dear object of my wishes! Ah! think not yet to pass the Stygian waves Till Tiridates comesâ'Tis thisâ [about to stab himself. Zen. O! hold! [stopping him. Tir. Ye Gods! Zen. O! hold and live. [takes away his sword. Tir. Zenobia! Heavens! [Zen. is going. My life, my soul! [following her. Zen. Forbear to follow me: I am not what I seem. [going. Tir. Ha! would'st thou thenâ [about to follow. Zen. Forbear to follow meâO! let me, prince, Entreat thus much; and she who gave thee life Can ask not less. Tir. But is it possible? [following her. Zen. Stop, or I slay myself. [about to stab herself. Tir. Just Heavens!âAh! yetâ Zen. If you advance a step this weapon's point Shall drink Zenobia's blood. Tir. Ah! holdâI yieldâ I quit theeâI obeyâBut hear me: whither, Ah! whither goest thou? Zen. Whither fate now calls. [going. Tir. Zenobia!âO! unkindâ Zen. Zenobia's dead. [Exit. SCENE IX. Tiridates alone. Princess! my love! O! hear me stillâYe powers! Where shall I turn? I dare not, thus forbidden, Pursue her steps, nor can remain behind: This, this is torture. SCENE X. Enter Mithranes. Mit. From Artaxata, My lord, the ambassadors are now arriv'd, Deputed by Armenia. Tir. [seeing, but not attending to him.] Haste, my friend, O! hasteâFor me pursueâIn pity haste, And stay her flight. Mit. Whom shall I stay? Tir. She lives! And breathes this vital air. Mit. Who lives, my prince? Tir. Zenobia lives. Mit. Alas! he raves. Tir. O! Heaven! Why dost thou loiter? Yonder lies the way: Her track is there. Mit. But yetâ Tir. [impatiently.] While thou delay'st The time in vain debateâshe's lost. Mit. I go. [aside.] O! how excess of grief distracts the sense! [Exit. SCENE XI. Tiridates alone. I know not where I amâI'm struck with wonder, And all appears a dream. Alas! how ill Her former tenderness agrees with rigour So harsh and cruel! Does Zenobia hate, Or love her Tiridates? If she hate me, Why would she save my life? And if she love, Then wherefore fly my sight? O! I should doubt 'Twere all deception, but too deeply here, Here in this breast her image is engrav'd. And can it be, some other nymph may bear Those semblant features? Nature, with her work Perhaps enchanted, might again produce Another form like hersâO! no, those eyes Were sure Zenobia'sâThose, and those alone Could wake the inward transports that I feel. This soul could ne'er to other eyes consign Such power to rule the heart of Tiridates. I know ye well, dear beauteous eyes, I know ye by the heaving sighs; The tumults here confess'd. I'm not deceiv'd; for still the same, Those looks alone can feed the flame That burns within my breast. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The open country, with Ãgle's cottage. Tiridates, Mithranes. Tir. But if myself I saw her? If myself Heard her but now? Yes, still her living form Is plac'd before my eyes; her well-known voice Still vibrates on my heartâZenobia lives! I dreamt it not, Mithranes. Mit. Lovers, sir, Even waking dreamâAffliction clouds the sense And blunts our reason: what is not, we see; And what is present oft eludes our sight. The soul, from habit, figures to herself The ideas that delight us.âEach with ease Will feign what most he wishes. Tir. No: these feet Had trac'd her steps, but that the cruel sight Of my Zenobia, arm'd to pierce her bosom, Froze all my vital powers. Mit. O! think, my prince, Think of the duties which your rank demands. The Armenians offer you their vacant throne, And ask, for this, the head of Rhadamistus. Embrace the moment of propitious Fortune: You know too well her favours never last. Tir. Let Rhadamistus then be sought; the traitor Shall meet his punishment. But think not, friend, The bright reward of royalty incites The zeal of Tiridates; no, I burn To slay a victim to Zenobia's wrongs. Mit. Then still you cherish hope? Tir. But late I question'd A gentle shepherdess, her name is Ãgle: Behold her cottage here; from her we best May learn more certain tidings. Mit. But what said The maid when question'd? Tir. Nothing she replied. Mit. And yet you hope? Tir. I doâAt what I ask'd She seem'd confus'd: she look'd on me and blush'd. She strove to speakâbegan as if to explain Her secret thoughts, then sunk again to silence. Mit. Alas! how little will suffice to feed A lover's hopes. Tir. I'll speak again with Ãgle; Go, lead her to me. Mit. Instant I obey. [goes into the cottage. Tir. What cruel conflict now of hope and fear Divides my breast! No other state on earth Can equal what I feel. Mit. [returning.] The shepherdess Is absent thence, and vacant now the dwelling. Tir. I'll wait for her return.âGo, seek the camp. Mit. Your care is vain: the bloody robe which late These eyes beheldâ Tir. Cruel, unkind Mithranes, What have I done?âO! take not from me thus The last dear hopeâAt leastâ Mit. Too oft, my prince, You know that hope is with deception join'd. [Exit. SCENE II. Tiridates alone. I know not if deceit may give That hope the wretched find; But this I know, by hope we live; The balm that heals the mind. I know that oft in sleep we prove The solace of our woe; And oft from dreams of those we love Our waking comforts flow. [goes into the cottage. SCENE III. Zenobia, Ãgle. Zen. Go then, my friend, go seek and bring him to me. From what I have said thou wilt not fail to know The husband I have lost. Amidst these woods He surely dwells. Till thy return I'll wait Conceal'd within thy cottageâO! I tremble, Lest once again I meet with Tiridates. The first encounter teaches me with care To shun a second. Ãgl. He who loves you, princess, May plead forgiveness: never have I view'd A mien more graceful. Zen. Hast thou seen him then? Ah! where? Ãgl. But now I met him: he, who seeks Tidings of you from all, with me awhile Discours'd of his Zenobia. Zen. Ah! what then Could Ãgle say? Ãgl. With stupid gaze I stood To wonder at his form, his gentle looks, His pleasing speechâ Zen. I ask not this, my friend: Awake not thus, with such insidious praise, The conflict in my bosom.âDidst thou then To him reveal my fortune? Ãgl. I remember'd Your caution given, and kept a faithful silence. Zen. Now go, and with my spouse returnâTake heed, And should'st thou meet with Tiridates, still Observe my laws prescrib'd. Ãgl. Were I dispos'd, I never could betray you: in his presence My lips refuse an utterance to my words. A magic in those eyes I view, A charm that ne'er before I knew: With him my tongue its speech denies. He questions me: I strive to speak; Confus'd, the blushes stain my cheek; And while in vain for words I seek, My words dissolve in broken sighs. [Exit. SCENE IV. Zenobia. Tiridates in the cottage. Zen. Alas! my heart, too well I understand Thy feelings now: thou gladly would'st embrace (Thus left alone,) the freedom to complain. Complaints are bred from weakness, but Zenobia Less fears another's censure than her own; And even in secret would she blush to find Her firmness shaken. You, ye powers! who breath'd Such virtue in my soul, expose it not To meet a second trial; let one proof Suffice my triumph: lead me not again To Tiridates' sight.âHow can I ever Declare myself another's? This confession Might kindle all his rage against my husband. I tremble at the thoughtâAnd ah! his grief Would strike too deeply here. Should chance once more This way conduct himâLet me haste to shun The cruel risk. This cottage offers me A wish'd asylumâAh! some stranger hereâ I see, or fear impress'd upon my mind, Has feign'dâO! Heaven! 'tis he! 'tis Tiridates! Tir. [coming out.] Zenobia! 'tis in vain to fly me now: Where'er thou goest behold me present still. Zen. Stay, Tiridatesâhold. Tir. Alas! Zenobia, What shall I say? Zen. [aside.] Now, now my trial comes! Tir. And am I Tiridates? Is it thus Thou giv'st me welcome? Princess most belov'd, Is this the hour for which so much I languish'd? Could the short space of two revolving moons Suffice to change thee thus? What mean these cold, These freezing looks? Ah! what has robb'd me thus Of all thy wonted tenderness? Has aught Against me kindled thy resentment? Speak: Hast thou forgot thy faith? Impossible! Thou art not capable of stains like these, I know, my lifeâ Zen. My lord, since you compel me With you awhile in converse to remain, Though but some moments, let not these at least Be spent in vain. Tir. And does it then displease theeâ Zen. It doesâReluctant I remain; then hear me, And give me proof of Tiridates' virtue. Tir. I tremble while thou speak'st. Zen. The sacred ties Of regal nuptials, by the hand of Fate Are form'd in Heaven; nor is the choice our own. For had the stars allow'd me to direct My life, I then had found in Tiridates The man of all mankind to make me happy. But this can never be; our destiny For ever parts me from thee, and I bow Beneath the hard decree.âGo then in peace, And leave me here in peace.âO! never more Appear before these eyes; take from us, prince, Such danger to our virtueâYes, that virtue Which join'd us first, and now dissolves the bands. Tir. Assist me, Gods! and must I never more Indulge my hopes? Zen. You have no longer hope. Tir. But wherefore? Who, ah! who can bear thee from me? What crime of mine? Zen. Ah! what avails it, prince, To dwell on that with pain, which will but raise The affections duty bids us now subdue? Farewell! too long already you detain me. 'Tis not your guilt or mine that parts us now: Let this suffice, and seek to know no further. Tir. Barbarian! canst thou then so coldly speak? Thou know'st not thou art my fame, my peace, my life; That if I lose thee, all to me is lost; That never other objectâ Zen. Prince, farewell! [going. Tir. Tell me at leastâ Zen. I cannot. Tir. Hear me. Zen. Oh! I must not hear you. Tir. Dost thou hate me thus? Thus fly my sight? Zen. Ah! did I hate you, sir, I still might have remain'd.âI fear your presence; 'Tis hostile to my duty: though my reason Is firmly fix'd, yet great are your deserts, And O! such conflict serves at least to rend, If not subdue my heartâAnd see you not, (O! Heaven!) that now before youâthat remembranceâ Depart, departâI shall confess too muchâ Respect at once my virtue and your own. Yes, I entreat you, prince, by all your soul Has priz'd on earth, or most reveres in Heaven; Even by the tender love that bound us once; By the dear spirit that informs your bosom; By these sad tears you force me thus to shed, O! leave meâfly, my lordâavoid my presence. Tir. And must I see thee never, never more? Zen. No, never, prince, if still to you are dear My peace and glory. Tir. Cruel, cruel sentence! Zen. Go, seek for comfort and farewell! And happy, though in absence dwell, Nor lose a thought on me. Tir. Ah! speak not thus, relentless fair. But sooner from this bosom tear The heart that bleeds for thee. Zen. I feel a cold through every vein. Tir. My pulse forgets to move. Both. What sufferings now must both sustain! O! unpropitious love! Such anguish only death can cure: Not such the happy know, Who ne'er, alas! like us endure The pangs of parting woe. [Exeunt severally. [Before the departure of Zen. and Rhad. Zop. appears behind, unseen of them, and stops to observe them. SCENE V. Zopyrus and followers. Zenobia, Heavens! and Tiridates here! Zenobia lives again? And wherefore thus Depart from him in tears? It must be soâ She loves him stillâBut no; the rigid fair, Virtuous Zenobia, wife to Rhadamistusâ âYet, what can rigour or can virtue aught Avail to rule the bosom's tenderest passion? What cruel, what unheard-of jealousy Is this I feel? To find some happier lover Dispute her heart, yet know not who's my rival. With doubtful jealousy that glows Within my tortur'd breast, nor knows What secret rival to oppose, A thousand racking pangs I prove. At once I love, at once I hate, And such the tenour of my fate, I dare not hope revenge or love. [as he is going he sees Rhad. and stops. But see from far where Rhadamistus comes, And comes this way. My followers are at hand; Delay not then his death. Perhaps already He may suspect me: where we parted last, He stay'd not my return.âBut if Zenobia Is Tiridates' lover, by his death I shall but from a powerful foe deliver A favour'd rival.âCould I find the means To kindle strife between them; make them fall By mutual slaughter, and myself from both Usurp that fruit the victor should have gain'dâ This were a master-piece of policy. It must be duly weigh'd.â[to his followers.] Amidst these trees Be now, my friends, conceal'd.â[they retire.] Behold him here: Now to my workâBut with him comes a nymph. I'll wait till she retires, and he alone Remains for my design. [conceals himself. SCENE VI. Enter Rhadamistus and Ãgle, as in conversation. Zopyrus apart. Rhad. Deceive me not, Ah! courteous shepherdess.âTo sport with misery Were cruelty, alas! that ill would suit Thy gentle nature. Ãgl. Think not I deceive you: Your consort lives.âI drew her from the stream Pierc'd with her wound, and sav'd her at the peril, With her unhappy life to lose my own. Rhad. Ah! lovely nymph! my tutelary Goddess! Is such compassion found in savage woods? Yesâvirtue these resides; in peopled cities Are only known the semblance and the name. Ãgl. We now have reach'd the place.âExpect me here; I'll haste before you and prepare Zenobia. [goes into the cottage. Rhad. I burn with fond impatience to behold her, And yet I tremble to approach her presence: I'm warm'd by love and chill'd by deep remorse. Ãgl. [coming out of the cottage.] Zenobia is departed; vainly there I seek to find her. Rhad. O! Almighty Powers! Ãgl. Be not dismay'd: she surely will return; Perchance for us she seeks. Rhad. O! noâShe hates, She shuns me nowâAlas! I cannot blame her; Just is her hatred, Ãgle; nor have I Deserv'd to suffer less from her resentment. Ãgl. Zenobia hate you? Shun you? Ill indeed You know your spouse: such false suspicion wrongs The truest consort that the world has known. For you she seeks, for you alone she sighs, And trembles but for you.âShe even defends, And loves your cruelty; while he, who hears Her plead your cause, no longer can condemn you: She calls the hand that struck her merciful. Rhad. O! let us haste to find her; at her feet Let me expire with love, with shame and sorrow. Ãgl. Removing hence, you may perchance but lose Her whom you hope to find. Rhad. Go then, my Ãgle, Do thou pursue the searchâAlas! delay notâ Forgive my hasty warmthâI sigh to gain A blessing mourn'd so long with heart-felt anguish. Ãgl. Though press'd with anguish, who would e'er Beneath his grief repine; Who, though decreed such grief to bear, Could say, âThat heart is mine?â Two souls whom equal passions sway, One only soul will prove; Since both but one desire obey, And glow with mutual love. [Exit. SCENE VII. Rhadamistus. Zopyrus apart. Rhad. O! princess, worthy of a spouse less cruel; Generous Zenobia! When was ever known A spirit more exalted?âYou, who seek With envy to detract from female glory, Say, which of all our heroes e'er could boast A virtue more sublime? Zop. [coming forward,] Where, where, my prince, Have you at distance wander'd? Is it thus You waited my return? Rhad. O! come and share With me my happy fortuneâmy Zenobiaâ Zop. Zenobia lives. Rhad. And dost thou know it too? Zop. Would I had never known it! Rhad. Say'st thou? Wherefore? Zop. Wherefore? Enquire no further, Rhadamistus: Forget herâShe's unworthy of your love. Rhad. Tell me what causeâ Zop. Ah! what avails, my lord, To afflict you further? Rhad. Speak: thy silence more Afflicts me than thy speech. Zop. I shall obey. I saw your faithless spouseâbut, prince, already Your cheek is paleâForgive me, sir; it better Becomes me to be silent. Rhad. Speak, I charge thee. Zop. Since you commandâthen blame not me, my lord: But late I with her Tiridates saw Your faithless consort: from their view conceal'd, I heard them speak of love.âHe to her mind Recall'd each promise given, while she to him With solemn vows declar'd her former flame, Long cherish'd, burnt with all its wonted warmth. Rhad. False traitor! peaceâToo well I know Zenobia; She ne'er could thus betray me. Zop. 'Tis my duty To suffer all from you; but, O! my prince, This sure I merit not, for having seen Your dearest peace betray'd: yourself compell'd me At first to speak, and thenâ Rhad. O Heaven! I never Would doubt Zenobia's truth. Zop. Without my speaking You knew she fled youâbut perchance you knew not That all her soul was fix'd on Tiridates, And that a first affection never dies. Rhad. Too true, by Heaven! Zop. [aside.] 'Tis wellâthe poison works. Rhad. Immortal Powers! Are women thus inconstant? O! happy you, by friendly stars ordain'd Inhabitants of old Arcadian shades, If you, as fame reports, deriv'd your birth From senseless trunks. Zop. Ere you, my lord, aspir'd To gain her heart, 'twas given to Tiridates, And whilst he lives he ever will possess it. Rhad. But shall not longâI fly to pierce his breast. Zop. Yet holdâWhat can you hope? Amidst his guard Of troops in arms, you but in vain expose Your life to hazard.âCould we draw him thence Far from his friends to some sequester'd partâ Rhad. But how? Zop. Who knows? Let me reflect a littleâ We must secure the blow. Rhad. But rage like mine Brooks no delay. Zop. Then hearâBy my contrivance, A wily message, in Zenobia's name, Shall lure him to a place that suits our purpose. Rhad. But what if he mistrust the truth?â'Twere well At least to cloak it with some specious token. Ah! holdâthis shall secure itâtake this ring; It was Zenobia's, given by Tiridates When last they parted: she, that fatal day Which saw our nuptial rites, (as if she meant To abjure all memory of her former love,) On me bestow'd itâthen a treacherous pledge, But now the faithful instrument of vengeance. Zop. [aside.] Auspicious Fortune! [to Rhad.] In the lonely valley Where first we metâ Rhad. But whatâ Zop. The charge be mine To make our plot secure. Rhad. But still remember Ten thousand furies struggle in my bosom. I nought but venom now respire, My heart MegÃ¦ra's torches fire, Alecto's snakes my bosom breeds. No more with sighs and tears I mourn, All grief is pastâI rave, I burn With rage that every rage exceeds. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Zopyrus, and followers apart. Zop. O! glorious victory! For me my foes Will wage the fight, while I, without a blow Shall make Zenobia mine.âCome forth, my friends, [they come out. Go hence, and round enclose the vale of myrtles; Thither will Tiridates come to fight With Rhadamistus: there remain conceal'd, Nor interrupt their combat; but when one Shall fall beneath his rival, let your weapons Transfix the victor, wearied with his toil. Awayâbut some behind abide with me: I have a message soon for Tiridates. Yet softâI fear no follower of my own Must be an envoy here: he might discoverâ Some artless nymph, or rustic swain were bestâ But is not that I seeâ[looking out.] Propitious Gods! Look there, my friends, look where Zenobia comes: I leave her to your care.âWhen I am gone, By stratagem or force conduct her to me. What have I more to ask, could I but call That heart my own; or could I know at least Who would dispute it with me? Both the rivals 'Tis true will perish, but of these my hatred Knows not on which to fix; and doubtful hatred Must tarnish all the pleasure of revenge. This secret shall be known: my mind even now Suggests an artful falsehood that shall force Zenobia's self to unveil the truth to me. SCENE IX. Enter Zenobia. Zen. [entering.] What do I see? Thou in Armenia here; Thou Zopyrus? Zop. Ah! princess, blest event That brings thee thus before me: 'tis from thee I counsel seek, or rather seek command, In what concerns thy heart's most dear affection. Zen. Even now I hasten to pursue my spouse. Zop. To find or lose him must depend on thee. Zen. What dost thou mean? Zop. I'm bound by solemn compact, (Which nothing can annul,) to take the life Of Rhadamistus or of Tiridates. Zen. O! heavenly powers! Zop. Attend my words.âThe first Is by my followers now detain'd a prisoner; The second, by a message forg'd to blind him, For which this gem must seem a certain pledge, [shews the ring. Will soon be drawn to where his death is plann'd. Zen. Whence did thy hand receiveâ Zop. First hear me speak: The power is mine of these to kill or save Him whom my will elects.âThat choice shall now Depend on thee: the one by thee was lov'd, And one thou hast espous'd: for me determine, And, at thy pleasure, now absolve or sentence. Zen. And must I thenâO! cruel fate!âBut whence Such impious mandate?âWhat detested causeâ Who thus compels thee? Zop. Now 'twere long to tell; Time presses: much already have I lost In seeking theeânow open all thy heart, And let me be dismiss'd. Zen. Eternal Powers! And could'st thou then consent (O! most inhuman!) To such a deed as this? Zop. The sovereign mandate Admits of no dispute: my life must answer Should I neglect to obey. Zen. What punishment, What recompense, what power, howe'er supreme, Can make that just which bears the stamp of guilt? Zop. Adieu!âI came not hither to dispute With idle words.âThou see'st how far, Zenobia, Respect for thee might fix my wavering choice. âMyself shall then determine. [going. Zen. Stay, O! stay. Zop. [returning.] What would'st thou say? Zen. Fain would Iâyet reflectâ Assist me, Gods! Zop. I understand thee well. I must, without thy speech, prevent thy wishes: This ever was the privilege of women. Full well I know with reason must thou hate Inhuman Rhadamistus: well I know His stormy passions, jealousy unjust; The impious barbarous woundâenoughâere long Thou shalt have ample vengeance. [going. Zen. O! perfidious! And dost thou think Zenobia's heart can harbour Impiety like this? Zop. Be not offended: Thy silence had misled meâHo! conduct [to his followers. The princess to her consort, while I haste To take the forfeit life of Tiridates. [going. Zen. Yet hear me!âO! ye powers! you put my virtue To too severe a trialâMust these lips Pronounce the dreadful fate of Tiridates? How has he injur'd me? The soul of honour, The pride of spotless faithâand can I everâ Zop. Does still Zenobia doubt? Zen. She has no doubts: She knows too well whom duty bids her save, But shrinks with horror at the dreadful ransom. Zop. I must no longer here remainâdecide, Or I am gone. Zen. O! yet a moment stay. Thou surely may'st consentâ Zop. We lose the time In vain expostulation.âOne must die. Zen. Let then the deathâO Heaven! how shall I speak it? âPreserve for meâ Zop. Sayâwhom? Zen. Preserve them both, If thou would'st have me owe to thee my peace; If both thou canst not saveâyet save my husband. Zop. [aside.] 'Tis Rhadamistus then enjoys her love. [to her.] And canst thou then, Zenobia, will the death Of such a faithful lover? Zen. [in agony.] Save my husband! And tell me not (O Heaven!) what victim dies. Zop. Would'st thou to life thy lord release, To loose his bonds be mine; Would'st thou preserve thy future peace, That care to me resign. I pardon every doubt of me, Whose heart thou ne'er hast known; But soon, by what I've done for thee, Shall Zopyrus be shown. [Exit. SCENE X. Zenobia alone. And dost thou still, inhuman, live? Still breathe? And could'st thou then pronounce the fatal sentence, Yet feel not instant death, or break with horror The heart where gratitude no longer dwells? Since thenâbut what Zenobia, hast thou said? Why wander thus?âThou hast fulfill'd thy duty, And now lament'st with all a woman's weakness. O! think this grief eclipses every merit Of such a triumph: equal is the guilt Of evil actions done, or good repented. Alas! 'tis trueâyet Tiridates dies! And dies by my decreeâeven now, perhaps, With his last breath invokes Zenobia's name. Defend him, pitying Gods! To save my husband Was mine, 'tis yours to succour innocence. The suppliant prayers of one who knows not falsehood Fly wing'd to Heaven.âI come not now before you With sorrows that derive their source from crimes: From a pure spring my tears unsullied flow. Ye righteous Gods! who only know The heart's conceal'd desires, Can tell if pure compassion now My blameless vow inspires. 'Tis true, from virtue's path severe You bid me ne'er depart; But different must in Heaven appear The just and cruel heart. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>

Because I deem'd Some treachery was design'd. Rhad. [aside.] In evil hour Did Zopyrus to this nymph intrust his charge. [to her.] But wherefore didst thou then accept from him The secret message? Ãgl. Lest another hand Should execute his purpose. Rhad. [aside.] Now I know Why I so long have staid, and staid in vain, For Tiridates at the appointed valley. Ãgl. I go to tell Zenobia all the treason My thoughts suggest. Rhad. Forbear: it nought avails To tell Zenobia. Ãgl. Yes, 'twere meet she knew That some dark traitor plots against her fame And spotless faith. Rhad. And canst thou know to whom Belongs the name of traitor, or of faithful? Ãgl. And canst thou doubt? Rhad. There is no longer doubtâ Zenobia's falsehoodâ Ãgl. Hold: thou mak'st my blood Run cold with horror. Rhad. Knowâ Ãgl. I know full well That little thou deserv'st such truth and love. Rhad. But hear me, nymph, I amâ Ãgl. Unjust, ungrateful, Inhuman, cruelâ [going. Rhad. If thou canst, remove Suspicion from me. [following her. Ãgl. Rather let it still Dwell in thy breast, and be thy punishment. [Exit. SCENE II. Rhadamistus alone. But hear meâgive me but at least some proofâ In whom shall I confide? While Zopyrus Proclaims Zenobia false, as firmly Ãgle Maintains the thoughts that drive my soul to madness, Are light as empty dreams.âImmortal Gods! Who now deceives me, Zopyrus or Ãgle? Fell Jealousy! thou tyrant of my heart, Still, still thou say'st, â'tis Ãgle that deceives thee.â Ah! wherefore, since I thus detest The jealous fear that haunts my breast; Still must I feel the cruel pest, That rankles at my peace? What calm can e'er this heart regain? When every hour I strive in vain To clear my doubts, but still retain Such doubts as never cease? [as he is going he hears the voice of Zenobia: he stops to listen, then returns. Zen. [within.] But whither do we go? Rhad. What voice is that? Or I'm deceiv'd, or 'twas my wife that spokeâ The sound was surely thenceânow let me seek her; And favouring Fortune smile upon my wishes! [while Rhad. goes out the way where he heard the voice, Zen. and Zop. enter by another. SCENE III. Zenobia, Zopyrus. Rhadamistus, who enters again unseen behind. Zen. [entering.] And yet I know not whither thou would'st lead me. Zop. Fear nothing: follow me. Zen. [aside.] My heart presages Some evil is at hand. [stops. Rhad. [to himself.] Behold her here, And with her Zopyrus.âAwhile I'll listen, And prove his truth. [stands apart. Zop. [to Zen.] What dost thou? Come, Zenobia, I lead thee to thy husband. Zen. When, O! when Shall we behold him? Zopyrus, but now Thou feign'dst him little distant.âLong, ah! long With thee I've stray'd in these bewildering paths, And yet I see him not. Zop. Thou hast him present. Zen. My husband present!âO! immortal Gods! Say howâwhere is he? Zop. IâI am thy husband. Zen. Eternal Powers! Rhad. [apart.] Ha!âlet the traitor dieâ Noâlet us first learn all th' extent of treason His impious arts have plann'd. [about to draw his sword and discover himself; he stops. Zen. And hast thou thus, Thus dar'd to address the wife of Rhadamistus? Zop. I now address his widow. Zen. Heavenly Powers! Does not my husband live? Zop. But now I sent him To meet his certain death. Rhad. [apart.] I burn with rage! Zen. O! perjur'd traitor! Is it thus thou keep'st Thy plighted faith? Zop. In what have I deceiv'd thee? Zen. In what? And said'st thou not that Rhadamistus, Or Tiridates must, by doom severe, Be made a wretched victim? Zop. 'Tis most true. Zen. That I might one of these at choice elect, And thou would'st to my tears ensure his safety? Zop. Even so. Zen. And did I not entreat thee then To spare a husband's life? Zop. Thou say'st it well: I swore to obey thee, and to keep my oath, Preserv'd for thee a spouse inâZopyrus. Rhad. [apart.] I can no longer hold. Zen. O! wretched prince! O! my betray'd, my murder'd Rhadamistus! Zop. In vain thou call'st on him, who now resides Amongst the dead. Rhad. [discovering himself.] Thou liestâhe lives, thou traitor! To be thy punishment. Zop. I am betray'd. Zen. My life! my lord! Rhad. Thou double traitor! thusâ [draws, and is about to attack him. Zop. Forbear, or by this hand Zenobia dies. [draws a dagger with his right hand and seizes Zen. with his left, in act to strike her. Rhad. [stopping.] What would'st thou do? Zen. O! cruel, cruel fortune! Rhad. I cannot curb the fury that impels meâ âMost impious wretch! Zop. If thou but mov'st a step, Zenobia's dead. Rhad. What misery is mine! Zen. O! my lov'd spouse! since Heaven restores my fame, Let not his threats affright theeâNo, my blood Shall from this bosom freely flow, if pure The purple stream, my soul, from mortal bonds Be gladly loos'd; if loos'd, she leave behind Without a blush, this chaste, unsullied frame. Rhad. O! dearest part of me! O! lively pattern Of loyalty and truthâto find thee thus, And in such hands!âO! Zopyrus! have pity! If still thou bear'st a sense of human feelings, Some remnant of the manâRestore my wife: I never, never will exact revenge; I swear it hereâforget, forgive thee all. Zop. O! noâI shall not trust thy plighted faithâ Depart and leave me. Rhad. By the immortal Godsâ Zop. Departâor see her perish. Rhad. Savage monster! A fury worse than black Cocytus' fiends: O! let me tear from that detested bosomâ [advancing. Zop. Take heedâ [threatening Zen. Rhad. O! holdâWhere art thou, Rhadamistus! O! give me counsel, Gods!âmy wife!âthou traitor! What torture do I feel!âAt once my soul Laments and ravesâmy heart is torn between Contending pangs of tenderness and rage! Zop. Zenobia, come with meâthou, Rhadamistus, Unless thou mean'st to see her dead before thee, Beware how thou pursu'st us. Rhad. Pity now Gives way in me to fury. Zop. Come, Zenobia. Zen. And does my lord forsake me thus? Rhad. O! noâ Take this, thou wretch! [about to attack him. Zop. Then let her die. [about to stab Zen. Rhad. O! hold! Yet, yet forbear. SCENE IV. Enter Tiridates. Tir. What would'st thou, impious slave? [seizing him. Zop. O Heaven! Tir. Resign thy weapon. [wrests the dagger from him. Zop. I am lost! [he flies. Rhad. Perfidious traitor! vainly would'st thou 'scape me. [Exit in a rage. SCENE V. Zenobia, Tiridates. Zen. Ah! whither goest thou? Stay, my lordâ [going after Rhad. Tir. Ingrate! So soon would'st thou forsake me? Zen. PrinceâO Heaven! I begg'd of thee to shun me. Tir. Ah! what mystery Is hid beneath thy words?âI will obeyâ But tell me, wherefore dost thou fly me thus? Zen. Thou wilt know all, and know it all too soon: Farewell. [going. Tir. Forgive meâI must follow. Zen. Noâ It cannotâmust not be. Tir. But now I saw thee Threaten'd by ruffian force.âThe hand that threaten'd I knew not, nor the hand that would have sav'd thee, I could not bear to leave thee thus alone, Expos'd to certain peril. Zen. Greater peril Awaits me here with thee. Tir. At least I mayâ Zen. Leave me in peaceâin pity grant my suit: Life is your gift, with gratitude I own it; But wherefore make to me your gift unhappy? O! let me now at least obtain A momentary rest; Nor thus a war and storm again Awaken in my breast. A storm, in which my soul may rove, And risk a spotless name; A war, in which the strife may prove Destructive to my fame. [Exit. SCENE VI. Tiridates alone. I know not what Zenobia's words import, Nor what myself intends.âShe drives me from her, Yet tells not why.âThere's something from that lip So sweetly sounds; there's something on that brow So awful shines, as ever must defend her, And strike all censure dumb. SCENE VII. Enter Mithranes. Mit. My lord, I bring Most welcome tidingsâRhadamistus now Is made your prisoner. Tir. Ha! and where, Mithranes? Mit. He came himself, unweeting, midst your troops To wear your ready chains. Tir. Relate the whole. Mit. In swift pursuit a flying warrior's steps He follow'd, and with matchless boldness enter'd Within your tents.âAgainst a thousand swords That glitter'd round to oppose his furious passage, Eager he sought the object of his vengeance. At once he saw, o'ertook, and pierc'd his breast. Tir. Unheard-of rashness! Mit. Yet all is not told. This done, he hop'd again to leave the valley, And might have scap'd, but at his greatest need His sword broke short, and left his hand defenceless. And still, though numbers round him countless press'd. With threatening arms, alone, without a weapon, He scarcely deign'd to yield. Tir. The wretch who fell Beneath his rage was surely he, whom late I here beheld. SCENE VIII. Enter Ãgle behind, unseen. Mit. The life of Rhadamistus Behold is in your hand. Ãgl. [to herself.] What do I hear? Mit. O! let the traitor suffer for his crimes. Tir. Then be it soâMithranes, let us go. [going. Ãgl. [coming forward.] Forbear, O! prince, forbear to vent your anger On one whom cruel Fortune's frown pursues. Tir. And what can urge thee to defend the life Of this perfidious? Ãgl. Yet I deem not, sir, His guilt so certain. Tir. But Zenobia's father By treason he destroy'd. Mit. And next the daughter He sought to slay: for he, whose eyes beheld The assassin's barbarous stroke, could not deceive me. Ãgl. Think better yet.âWe must not lightly give Our faith to common rumour.âWith a foe Mercy is ever lovely. Tir. Tiridates Might in oblivion steep his private injuries, But never can forgive Zenobia's wrongs: To her his blood in sacrifice is due. Ãgl. Believe me, she requires not this. Tir. Though she Demand it not, her virtue claims it from me. [going. Ãgl. Yet holdâO Heavens! [aside.] Believe what now I speak: If thou canst love Zenobia, then respect The life of Rhadamistus: headlong zeal Would plunge thee deep in error; thou would'st serve Zenobia's honour, and thou kill'st her peace. Tir. Ha! does she love him then? Ãgl. Alas! my lord, She wouldâif more than this thou seek'st to know, I mustâAlready have I said too much. [aside. Tir. Thou seem'st confus'dâWhat can this mean, Mithranes? A chilling dampâ'tis true, that Rhadamistus Was once my rival.âNow conceal'd he lurks Amidst these woods, where too Zenobia dwells. In her defence he stood, and she pursued His flying steps; but me she heeds no more: Ãgle has since declar'd.âO! gentle nymph, [to Ãgl. Whate'er thou know'st in pity now reveal. Ãgl. I can no further speakâEnough already My lips have utter'd. Tir. Ah! what freezing hand Weighs heavy on my heart? What cruel doubts Are these I feel? My peace is lost for ever! By proof I know the heart may bear A beauty's cruel reign; But torments from a faithless fair No lover can sustain. If she I love my hope deceive, And all her vows forego, Ere I, ye powers! this truth believe Let death conclude my woe! [Exit. SCENE IX. Ãgle, Mithranes. Ãgl. Unhappy prince! O! how my bosom feels For all his sufferings! How that pleasing aspect, His eye's soft glance, the music of his words Command each heart to share with him in sorrow; A lover form'd like him, alas! deserves Far other fate.âO! that 'twere given to Ãgle To make his days more happy! Mit. Doubtless Ãgle Displays a feeling mind, and Tiridates Is worthy all her pity: but such feeling Is warmer sure than mere compassion knows. Thy looks, O! gentle nymph, display The thoughts that now thy bosom sway; Thine eyes, where beams of softness play, No inbred cruelty proclaim. Though yet unfetter'd in his snares, Thy soul to Love no hatred bears; And modest pity oft prepares The virgin's heart to catch the flame. [Exit. SCENE X. Ãgle alone. Ah me! too trueâMy passion far exceeds The bounds of pityâHapless, hapless Ãgle! To what would'st thou pretend? Thy thoughts are rais'd To objects far above thee.âHeaven has doom'd A cottage for thy dwelling: quench such flames As only suit the torch of splendid loves. If this thou canst not doâat least suppress The conscious fire within, and waste in silence. What greater anguish can I feel? When he I love is nigh; I sigh, but ah! I dare not tell That 'tis for him I sigh. My feeble powers no more suffice My sufferings to sustain; Nor yet, alas! my heart supplies The courage to complain. [Exit. SCENE XI. A garden belonging to the palace of the kings of Armenia, inhabited by Tiridates. Tiridates, Mithranes. Mit. 'Tis all too true: too well you now conceive The words of Ãgle.âYes, Zenobia's love Is fix'd on Rhadamistus: when she heard Your troops had made him prisoner, from her cheek The colour fled: with eager speed she flew To reach the tents, and sought admittance to him, But found access denied. Tir. And yet, Mithranes, I cannot, must not thinkâ Mit. By her you soon Will find the truth confirm'd.âShe comes to ask Of you the prisoner's life. Tir. O Heaven! she dares not Insult me thus. Mit. Ere this she had preferr'd To you her suit, but that two Roman warriors, Who bring a written message from their camp, Detain her now impatient on the way. Tir. She must not meet my eyesâO! no, th' ingrate, I cannot bear her presence. Mit. See, she comes. SCENE XII. Enter Zenobia. Zen. Ah! prince! Tir. The mighty secret, Heaven be prais'd! Is now disclos'd.âAt length the powerful cause Of all my wrongs is known.âWhat seek'st thou? Speak: Be not dismay'dâThe worth of Rhadamistus May plead excuse for every broken vow. And com'st thou now to ask from me his freedom? To ask him for thy spouse? Must Tiridates Prepare the torches for thy happy nuptials? Zen. My lordâ Tir. Inhuman, barbarous, false Zenobia! Is this the recompense for love like mine? And dost thou thus betray me? And for whom? For whom betray me? Righteous Gods! for one Whose murderous guile depriv'd thee of a father? And thenâ Zen. You are deceiv'd: false rumour fix'd The guilt on him. Mit. [to Tir.] 'Tis true.âBy Pharasmanes The deed was plann'd.âPerfidious Zopyrus Confess'd it dying. Tir. Wilt thou then believe A traitor's words? Mit. A paper found upon him Confirm'd the whole: in this are given at full The secret orders for the monarch's death; All written by the hand of Pharasmanes. Zen. Behold, my lordâ Tir. Be silent: while you plead For Rhadamistus thus, your love condemns him. Zen. 'Tis true, I love him, and attempt not now To hide my love.âHis danger brings me hither; Zenobia comes to give him liberty: She comes from you to ask it.âRome once more Makes me the offer of Armenia's sceptre. In my behalf behold from Syria march The Latian bands: meantime the Armenians call On thee to fill their throne.âDo thou consent; Zenobia here will second their design: Restore to me in freedom Rhadamistus, And rule Armenia's kingdom. Tir. Surely mighty For a new lover such a sacrifice. Zen. But not, O prince! too mighty for a husband. Tir. A husband! Zen. I have said. Tir. Can this be true? Such secret too from me till now conceal'd? Zen. I fear'd to excite your rage against my consort; I fear'd your just affliction.âKnow, my heart Too weak to witness such a fatal trial, At least at distanceâ Tir. Cruel and inconstant! Ungrateful woman! Whom shall we believe, Or whom, Mithranes, trust? All is deceit We hear or seeâZenobia has betray'd me, And truth is lost for ever! Zen. Tiridates, Think not 'twas I betray'd thee.âNo, 'twas Heaven, And 'twas a father's will oppos'd our nuptials. I know not whether fear or hope induc'd The cruel change: I know that thou wert absent, And that this hand was destin'd to another. Tir. And could'st thou thenâ Zen. What power, alas! was mine? âBeholdâ (he cried) âthe only way, my daughter, âTo save my life, my kingdom and my honour.â Now say, had Tiridates been as me, What would he then have done? Tir. Have died, Zenobia. Zen. I do far moreâI part from thee and live: Death would have only serv'd to render short My time of suffering: I with mine had clos'd Thy dearer life, and disobey'd a father. Tir. Thy recent bands are little irksome to thee: Well hast thou toil'd for Rhadamistus' safety, And he has well secur'd thy heart.âI see Report was false, that e'er he sought thy life. Zen. O! no, 'twas true; but this can never make My bands more irksome. Tir. How!ânot irksome? Zen. No. Tir. He sought thy life and thou canst love him still? And love so firmly, that to ensure his safety Thou offer'st in exchange a kingdom's rule. Zen. Yes, Tiridatesâcould Zenobia less, She must neglect her glory, stain the honours Of all her ancestry; forget the duty A wife should cherish; slight the immortal Gods, That witness'd her espousals.âThee, O! prince, Thee must Zenobia wrong: where would be then The spotless innocence, the pride of soul That charm'd thee once in her? Say, should I then Have e'er been worthy Tiridates' love? Tir. Alas! what virtue fate has ravish'd from me! Zen. If it indeed be true that love is born Of minds congenial, wherefore with that virtue Should now thy grief contend? Noâimitate, Or rather, prince, surpass itâTiridates Can far outgo example.âWell I know Thy constancy of temper.âLet us quit The paths of vulgar lovers: let the sparks Of emulation glow in either breast. O! think what we must feel when we review Our glorious conquest; while the world shall learn That love, when cherish'd in a noble heart, Can breed, and only breed the fruits of virtue. Tir. Runâfly, Mithranesâto our presence bring In freedom Rhadamistus.âHow thy words, Exalted dame! can change the mind at will! Thou kindlest in my breast another flame That quenches now the first.âI see with envy The greatness of thy soul, and blush so long To lag behind thee.âI perceive my heart Is wholly chang'd: no more I love Zenobia; I worship, I adore herâIf I love her, A jealous lover of Zenobia's fame; A zealous follower of Zenobia's virtues: I love herâas a mortal loves the Gods. Zen. All thanks, protecting powers! Zenobia now Has not a foe: the greatest is subbued, The thought of thy distress.âGo, prince, and reign (For thou art worthy) in Zenobia's stead. SCENE XIII. Enter Ãgle. Ãgl. O! let me, dearest sister, clasp thee thus Close to my breast. [embraces Zen. Zen. What means my gentle Ãgle? What dream is this? Ãgl. No longer am I Ãgle: Behold your lost ArsinÃ¶e.âSee the mark Of crimson here, on the left arm impress'd Of all our race. Zen. 'Tis true, by Heaven! Tir. Ye powers! Zen. In one short moment what a tide of bliss! How knew'st thou this? [to Ãgl. Ãgl. From him, the aged shepherd, Till now believ'd my father.âThrice five years Have roll'd their course since from the Armenian rebels He had me then an infant; and till now Has kept me still the darling of his love: But late he heard the fortunes of Zenobia, And well he knows thee too, but not from me. I kept my faith unbroken.âWhether now Thy sufferings mov'd him; or that verging near The close of life, he was resolv'd again To give me back the honours of my birth, He call'd me to him, and with many a tear Told all the tale, and sent me to Zenobia. Zen. Well in thy face I read thy princely mind. SCENE LAST. Enter Rhadamistus. Rhad. Ah! Tiridatesâ Tir. Come, my lord, O! come: Behold Zenobia here, thy long-sought wife, I thus restore her to thee. Rhad. [to Zen.] O! forgive, Forgive your Rhadamistus. Zen. What offence Awaits my pardon? Rhad. Heavens!âmy jealous rage. Zen. Your jealous rage was kindled in your breast From love's excess.âThe cause I ever cherish, Th' effect I have forgotten. [embrace. Tir. Heavenly goodness! Zen. [to Tir.] To me, O! prince, the Gods restore a sister, To whom I owe my life, and fain would shew The gratitude she merits.âWell I know She loves thee, Tiridates: let that hand, Devoted once for mine, be given at least At my requestâbestow it on ArsinÃ¶e. Tir. Receive it, princessâ[gives his hand.] What thou bid'st, Zenobia, To me is ever sacred. Ãgl. Happy hour! Rhad. O! faithful spouse! Zen. O! generous Tiridates! Chorus. 'Tis false that Love, with tyrant sway Bids every will his rule obey, And o'er our freedom reigns. But lovers thus, while each pursues His wayward course, would faults excuse Which Fate in them ordains. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
