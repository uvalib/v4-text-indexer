      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE I. Saluzzo.âThe Court Yard of the Duke's Palace. Enter Gualtier and Petronio. Gual. Signor Petronio, you are most welcome to Saluzzo âand much is my contentment that your foreign education has not schooled you into a contempt of your native land: for in this outward-bred aversion to his country, a man but shows himself as a foolish child, who, spoiled by the nurse, despises the mother. A man's country is his father and motherâand he who suffers his affections to fall from her, is indeed guilty of a breach of the decalogue. Signor Petronio, I rejoice heartily to see you. Pet. My Lord Gaultier, your kindness flatters me; and as to the theme of one's countryâalthough I somewhat affect the cosmopoliteâthere is yet a voice in my heart which sings gladness as I tread the soil of my nativity: for, truly, on so fair a spot of earth as this Saluzzo, and blest with such friends as I boast here, although my natural parents be dead, I scarce can deem myself in the estate of an orphan. But, noble Signor,âis the Duke absolute in this matter of his divorce? Gual. Absolute,âI say it grievingly; for never did lady so grace the coronet that graced her, as doth the beauteous Bianca: she is a royal rose, the pride of whose form and colour doth well appear in her greatness and beauty; but its richest qualityâthe quality of sweetnessâin her virtues. Pet. I am bent to inquire more in the matter: for although a native here, having been an exile from my boyhood, I, of necessity, am mainly ignorant of what has hitherto chanced in Saluzzo. Gual. The history is longâyou shall have the epitome. Pet. 'Twill suffice, my lord. Gual. It is a theme for a better historian. About the time that, your parents dying, you were sent, a mere child, to England, there grew a most vehement desire in the public mind of Saluzzo, that our Duke should do that which might yield us good hope of an heir to the Dukedomâ marry; but he, then in the spring-flush of youth, and living in the wanton wilds of love, did hold himself averse to the walled garden of wedlockâand flatly refused the people's petition. Pet. And what then did the people? Gaul. Drove petition at the heels of petition so fast, that the Duke at length took their desires into entertainment, and bound himself to marryâwith this especial proviso: that his choice should have no rein; but be its own guide in all things. Pet. He could but choose nobly. Gual. He affected the nobility of natureâand passing the princesses of kingdoms, espoused the queen of a village, Bianca, the fair daughter of a private, but honourable gentleman âone Manso, who, although his allegiance permitted him not to deny the suit of his prince, yet strangely stood aloof from the proud alliance; haply foreseeing, from its wide inequality, the woe that hath indeed followed. Besides, he hath constantly refused all advancement; still playing the poor part of a country gentleman within the sunshine of his daughter's sovereignty. Pet. Strange!âBut hath she no other relatives whose fortunes might engraft themselves on hers? Gual. None, but a wild brother, named Aurelioâwhom the Duke much loved, and favoured at court; till his sudden honours, in a manner, drove him from himselfâand, as the steady-judging father predicted, swelled him into such excesses, that the Duke was reluctantly constrained to banish him his presence; and rumour hath since drawn Aurelio's life in such colours, as can but have grievously afflicted the virtuous Mansoâand the royal lady, who ever doted on her brother. Pet. Her sorrows are manifold. Gual. Well, Sir;âto renew: amid much muttered scandal, Duke Andrea espoused this Bianca, this regal-gifted villager;âand never was seen so much of heaven upon the earth as ensued: it was a palace, with all the sweet innocence and content of a cottage;âa cottage, with all the honour and appliances of a palace: the simple flowers of humility were strown amongst the gorgeous jewels of pride; and the sceptre meet for a princess, became honoured in the hand of a rustic. Pet. And did this long continue? Gual. Alas! no: scarce had the Duchess become a mother, when the Duke (curiosity might never learn wherefore) grew reserved and gloomyâbore himself harshly towards the lady Biancaâdwelt much on the meanness of blood; which the wayward people hearing, straight flew to the like conclusionsâand thus sanctioned, the Duke, it is partially believed, caused violent hands to be laid upon his infant daughter; for (when given out as dead) a certain ruffian, it is reported, was seen bearing her from the palace by midnight;âand since then, now sixteen years past, she has at least been dead to knowledge, if not in nature: I fear the last. Pet. This tale is more than piteous. Could a mother survive such cruel bereavement? Gual. She bore it like a martyrâwithout a tear, without a murmur! The shut book of her heart discovered no index; which, at first, when the Duke noted, he would clasp her in his armsâand sometimes smile, or weep, as the fit worked on him; and it proved ever hard of credence, that such smiles and tears could be those of a murderer. Pet. The crocodile weeps and the hyÃ¦na laughs, they say. What followed? Gual. More clouds: the Duke soon relapsed into his former moodâpierced the fond heart of his lady with perpetual unkindnessâgrew more and more morose; and nowâas a crown to his inhumanity, which many (I speak it in caution) are reasonably fain to attribute to a kind of brain-wanderingâhe has resolved upon this divorce, on pretence that his only child being dead, and Bianca bringing him no further issue, the good of his kingdom requires he should espouse one of royal blood, who may yield him a worthy heir to the Dukedom. Pet. This will go nigh to break three hearts, unless dissipation have turned Aurelio's into stone. Gual. Not so: Manso rejoices, and welcomes his daughter to her humble home again, with open heart and arms; whilst Aurelio, now absent at Bologna, pranks it there so wildly, that ignorance of his disgrace may happily be a bar to its annoyance. But the ladyâthe lady! she seems a suffering angelâbearing with a dignified meekness her lord's insane cruelty and the malignity of the many who, envying her exaltation, now greatly rejoice in her downfall. Pet. Poor heart! And doth his Holiness sanction this stern measure? Gual. He doth, Signor: and little marvel, since gold is so almighty with the saints of Rome. One Lucio, a travelled fop, who hath lounged over Europe and found all men alike, is momently expected in Saluzzo, with the Pope's written approval of the matter: the execution but awaits his arrivalâand, ho! here comes the man! Have I invoked Satan? Bear with him, Petronio. Pet. Oh! doubt me not. Gual. You could not mend him, Signor: he is too comfortably wrapped in the cloak of his conceit, to be chilled by the wind of ridicule. Good-day and welcome, to my lord Lucio! Enter Lucio. My friend Petronio, an' it please you,âfresh from merry England. Pet. I greet your lordship. Luc. Salutation's the word,âSignor, your slave. From England?âSo! I have been there myself; and truly, I found it a land of fogs, in which the natives walk, like Ulysses in his cloud, invisible. Oh, Sir!âa villanous country, England. Pet. Cold, Sir, indeed, and somewhat cloudy: but, a brave kingdom!âin dimensions a dwarf; in strength a giant,âa little head to the great body of the worldâindeed, a noble kingdom! Gual. His lordship knows. How fares the Pope?â bring you the dispensation? Luc. I kissed his Holiness' toe, and therein derived much spiritual comfort: I felt, as I may say, an enlivening of the soul; an invigoration of the principle of faith; a kind of tickling about the pericardium of grace; aâ. Gual. Bring you the dispensation? Luc. I do: and the Duke's crown is thereby endangered? Pet. How! Luc. His wife, Sirâhis wife. But, I must haste to the Dukeâthe divorce will proceed apace. Your Helot, gentlemen; in camp and court, yours: I go to accend grief; for the divorced lady, I trow, will even marry her tears, and encouch herself with sorrow. Gentlemen, au revoir! [Exit. Pet. The coxcomb!âhow heartlessly he speaks of sorrow! Gual. So substantial a feeling as pity cannot float in that shallow, his mind; nor can it sink thereâit is so shallow a shallow. But, come! Sir: I must present you to Duke Andrea: he walks i'the palace gardenâlet us in. Pet. I attend you, my Lord. The beams of his greatness must render us blind to his defects. But one word moreâhas any lady yet been named as the Duke's second bride? Gual. Ay, Signor. At the court of Peganus, Prince of Bologna, who espoused the noble Livia, the sister of our Dukeâresides a fair maiden of royal birth, called Rosamond; of whose excellent beauty the world has made itself the reporter and panegyrist: she it is, they say, whom the Duke solicits in marriage. Craves your curiosity further? Pet. I blush, my Lord Gualtier. Pray you, lead on. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Saluzzo.âThe Palace Garden. Enter Duke Andrea, attended; Lucio; and afterwards Gualtier and Petronio, at a distance. Duke. The setting sun upon the ground doth throw A most unseemly shadow from thy formâ Take it away! Luc. In truth, most dreaded Sir, To move my shadow, I must move myself. Duke. And 'tis thyself that I would have removed. Begone! I loathe that dress. Luc. It is the fashion. Duke. Out on the fashion!âOutâMy taste's my fashion. Thine errand's doneâbegone!âInfest me not. Luc. I kiss your Highness' handâ Duke. My gloveâfarewell! [Exit Lucio. Gual. Another tickle for his lordship's pericardium of grace. Pet. He's a great manâhand and glove with a Duke. Duke. I saw a monkey on a mongrel's back, And 'twas a farce to note his gravity: 'Tis thus these skipping jacks bestride the time, Playing the ape on't, like this monkey, Lucio. Gualtier and Petronio advance. Worthy Lord Gualtier!âthou'rt a man indeed: Manhood is in thy dress and in thy mannersâ Thou'rt worth a score of LuciosâWho is here? Gual. Petronio, Sir: my excellent young friendâ Newly from Englandâ Pet. Now your Highness' servant. Duke. Young Signor, you are welcome to our Court. We shall have need of youâYour leave, awhile. [Exit Petronio. Attendants retire. Gualtier! Gual. My Lord? Duke. Did Lucio tell you he had seen the Pope? Gual. He did my Lord,âand with a wide discourse. Duke. Would that all liars were fools!âthey'd do less mischief. I'd have him say soâbut he saw no pope: Of proctors, priests and clouted cardinals, Belike, he saw a bevyâbut no pope. You note this scroll, Sir?â'tis the papal bullâ A forged one. Gual. Forged! my lord? Duke. They'd hang us, Sir, in England. Ayâforged. What! think you, if the deed be wrong, The Pope, more than the Devil, can sanctify 't? And if 'tis right (as right, indeed, it is) What need of sanction to't? Princes are dolts, Thus to be ridden by a reverend Joan, Who whilst they stoop to take their rider up, E'en chuckles in his sleeve, and writes them, fools. But still the public conscience must be soothed, And here is that shall do the business: A cunning scribe of Rome the instrument Hath featly penn'd; and Lucio, my messenger, Being an ass, takes matters as they seemâ And so, no fear of him. What say the people Of this break-marriage work? No flinching! What? Gual. They are too loyal to condemn their prince. Duke. No matter, soft-tongued courtier, what they say. New toys allure men ever. Our young Duchess, Fresh-crowned and royal, shall the former drive Out of remembrance quiteâmake her grow stale In the most closet memory. Trusty Gualtier! Gual. Your Highness? Duke. Secret be as death, Lord Gualtier. I need thy serviceâand fair confidence Begets affection in the servitorâ Thou wilt not blab? Gual. I've read of Midas, Sir. Duke. But, lest thou should'st, I will not tell thee more. (Aside.) No word o'the forgery! We must despatch: Your friend Petronio, out of grace to you, We do select as our ambassador (To supersede fantastic Lucio) Unto Bologna: bid him there solicit The speedy presence of fair Rosamond Here at our court. See that no pomp be wanting! With gems of Ind and sweets of Araby Make giddy her dear sense: proud equipage Attend her; and be sure the spirit of music Do wait upon her footsteps. Let him hence! And with him, these. [Gives Gualtier letters. And that Duke Andrea's throne May for a queen have timely vacancy, Yourself, grave Councillor, give order due That all the nobles in assembly meet, To set the public seal to our divorce.â See to't, old friend. Gual. With diligence, my Lord. [Exeunt Duke and attendants. I would his Highness had another servant; Or that his servant had a better office! His mind's disturb'd: he's cruel, for he's mad! [Exit. SCENE III. Saluzzo.âThe Court-yard of the Duke's Palace. Enter Gualtier, with Letters, and Petronio. Gual. Despatch! Petronio: and, as you would insure further service, preserve a diligent ear and a ready eye; but let thy tongue be a sluggard, upon occasion. Here are the letters (giving them): and so, at once, farewell! Pet. I will use all speed. Good health continue with your Lordship! Farewell. [Exit. Gual. This is a strange whim of the Duke. Can he be sane? The whole matter is a mystery, whose depths my poor wits have not line enough to fathom: time must enlighten my dark apprehension, and events proclaim the history of motives. [Exit. SCENE IV. Saluzzo.âAn Apartment in the Duke's Palace. Enter Duke and Attendants. Duke. Sirs, to your sports! But, first; go, one of you, Unto the Duchess: Say, we wait her leisure. [Exeunt Attendants. O, for a draught of mental emboline! To neutralise this poison of the soulâ This mad suspicion, whose vile weed o'ergrows The sweetest flowers of life. Still seems she loyal; Fondâvery faithful: her obedience Foreruns commandâYet do I doubt, and doubt! Her babe, unbaptised, from her side was snatch'd; And yet she railed not; 'Twas her lord's behest, And that for her was warrant all enough To hold her grief in chainsâand still, I doubt! I've heap'd the ice of chill indifference Upon the bright fire of her seeming love, In which it melts invisiblyâquenching nothing Of its clear warmth; nothing apparent, nothingâ But yet, I doubt! She loves my greatness only; Prizing the state whereto my love exalts her, More than the love that raises herâTo this, As to a twig, my faint and sinking doubts, Those o'erwrought swimmers, cling. I must have proof! Yesâthe divorce!âAnd if, when so disgracedâ And with a rival near the throne she fills With such a meekness, that authority Takes lessons of submission from her smilesâ She be still constant, and resentless still, However tempted unto mutiny (And strongly shall she be temptation-tried) And keep (unmoved by passion's pettiness) Unclouded the pure heaven of her loveâ By the bright stars! she is a living gem Whose worth the unsearched treasures of the spheres Could not pay down. But, hold!âlet me not play The blind adventurer with my happiness; And like an over-eager merchant, lose The present thrift, to all need adequate, In greedy speculation after more, Which being gained, were superfluity: For that, indeedâbut, no! I rest resolvedâ Enter Bianca. Ho! ladyâare you come? Bianca.âBianca Bianca. My dear lord? Duke. How? Bian. My lordâI pray you, pardon me: My tongue must go to school. I wait, my lordâ The poor wife waits her royal husband's will. Duke. My wife no more! Take titles that become thee. Duke Andrea's wife should boast her of a race Whose veins run kingly blood.âO! doff those robes: This masquerading hath endured too long. Cloak thee in russetâgo! Is that a tear That dims the lustre of thy blue-bell eye?â How's this, Bianca? Bian. Noâbelieve me, Sir: You wrong your hand-maid. True, the dress I wear Speaks of a splendor that derides my birth;â But who, my lord, first clothed me in't?âwho bade Me to forego my country weeds, and don The robe of state?âwho snatched me from the vale, To place me on the pinnacle I fall from? Who, but my lord?âYou see no tear: I scorn To weep!âguilt weeps; but I am innocent. Duke. Who says I ever thought that you were guilty? You are no Roman matron, that repine not At noble suffering for your country's good: By heaven! you grieve. Bian. Mine is no Roman cause. Duke. That's wildly said; it is a Roman cause. Saluzzo with one voice cries out for offspring, That may rule o'er her with a lineal sway, When I be dust. We have no child, Bianca. Bian. Have we no child, my lord? We had a childâ Heaven pity her sweet soul! Duke. Of that, no more! I will have no pretenders to my throne, That are not of my bloodâI must have heirs! Bian. May theyâ Duke. Nay, 'soothâyou have my pity, lady: 'Tis grievous punishment to those who walk In golden clouds, to find them very clouds: Indeed, 'tis sadâand for a woman, most soâ To leave the glitter of pomp, the knee of homage, The voice of flattery, the wand of powerâ All in a moment, for humility And life obscureâI see it moves you, lady. Bian. Duke Andreaâno! Power, flattery, homage, pompâ Tho' held, were treasureless; without the jewelâ The crowning one of my life's diademâ My sovereign's love; there lies the loss I mourn,â And none but thatâthat cuts me to the quick. Were he a shepherd of Saluzzo's plains, He would be then, as nowâmy poor heart's king. Duke. Now could I laugh: what! love? the school-girl's dream; The youngster's visionâthe starved poet's chime; The thing of fables, raw inventionsâlies! A riddle, jestâMidsummer-craziness; Air, wind, breath, vapor, shade, shade's shadowânothing! Is't this you stumble on? Bianca's mad! Bian. I am your jest, my lord: came I for this? Duke. For thisâand this: There goes an embassy Unto Bologna, by to-morrow's morn-break, To gratulate my bride and tend her hitherâ Is her heart marble? (aside) Andâcome near, Biancaâ A great assembly will be straight convened, To sanction our divorce.âShe's more than woman. (aside) Your presence will be needed.âThat was thunder! (aside) Bian. (kneeling). Spareâspare me that! O, any thing but that: All griefs but that! Let not the public eye Behold my degradation: let me not Be greeted with cold pity and the cryâ There goes Bianca, she who was the Duchess: Dread Sovereign! Spare me that. I will go hence Unseen, unknownâand never more molest you; But hide my sorrows in my father's bosom, Without a thought that shall be rebel to you; Love you in silence, pray for youâand die. Duke. That were not well: for busy men would say We shrunk from dutyâand by private dealing Slander'd a public cause. All must be openly And freely done. Dares she who was my wife, Shrink back from duty? Bian. (rising). Never! Call the assembly: Your outcast will be there. Duke. Enough: now leave me. [Exit Bianca. Am I not cruel? Can it be she loves me. With such a nobleness? With love that centres All in myself, as man; holding for nought The trappings of my stateâthe fictitious Nature of greatnessâmost so, when 'tis highest? O! if she stand the proof, 'twill give the lie To all the calumnies men ever heap'd Upon the name of womanâSo, I'll on: And thouâdove Pity! fold thy wings awhile, Nor flutter in my heart. By those same letters Unto my sister Livia and her lord, My agents in these mysteriesâthey'll contrive it. My pretty Rosamond! thou'lt play the Duchess With a rare graceâa sweet unconsciousness Of thine own quality. A copious fount Unto conjecture's streams, my deeds will be: But, let the subject prate!âit stirs not me. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE I. Bologna.âA Street. Enter Aurelio. Aur. But that 'tis true, the sprucest gentleman May tumble in the mire; and therefore, I, Heaven knows! not nicely furnish'd, need not swear When I do tripâI should heap oaths on oaths; Blaspheme the stars and their high tenement; Curse the dull earth whereon we wretches breathe, And damn my weary life. All's lostâall's spent! No money and no creditânot a whit: And my grave father, his last drop of patience Oozed, bids me hope but little from the dregs. Duke Andrea, whom by right I style my brother, Might yet be lenient: but I scorn to kneel,â Seeking forgiveness on an abject knee, For what was but youth's venial levity. I'll sup with beggars first. Philosophy! Come to my aid: it is a natural law, That all must reap according as they sow: I've planted briars, and so gather thornsâ And thorns prick fingers sadly. Well?âNo matter! The rose hath thorns: my passions are my thorns: But come, good spirits! be ye as a rose; Bloom in the midstâand be their ornament! How now? Bisaccioâ Enter Bisaccio. What gale blows you hither So fast? Bis. An ill one to my friendâand so To me, since that his griefs are mine. Aur. Well? speak! Bis. I have grave tidings for Aurelio's ear. Aur. Why, hang up gravity! Yet give them vent: I never was more bent on seriousness. Your news? Your news? Bis. I pray you friend, receive them patiently. Aur. Why, man, what is it? Hath an earthquake chanced? Or have the winds blown half the solid earth Into the fluent sea?âWhat? in God's name! I've learnt endurance in a rugged schoolâ Out with it! then. Bis. O! it will touch you nearlyâ Aur. My father's dead. Bis. May his good life be long! Of him I bear no word; nor doubt he's well. Biancaâ Aur. Say she's deadâand break my heart! In all my madness, to fond memories Of that dear sister have I clung for health; And if she's deadâwhy, then, I am but dust: The dial of my life hath lost the sun That told bright hours upon't. Bis. She is not dead. Aur. I live, then, in her life: since she be well, I may not dream what ghostlike tidings bring you, To fright my midnight spirit. Speak! Bis. Not dead, But, oh! far worse than dead: her honour's dead, And your lies buried with it. Oh! Aurelio She isâ Aur. SpeakâDeath! Bis. Divorced. Aur. Fire of deep hell! Divorced? I'll not believe it: idlest report Hath played the mocker with you. She divorced? Bis. Past every doubt. Aur. Tut! you are credulous. Duke Andrea loves her, man: he singled her From out the world, for beauty and for virtue: Gave her two crownsâhis greatness and his loveâ And this the richer: and altho' of late, 'Tis said he hath been somewhat tyrannous, And his child's death prompts whispers ominousâ Whilst many hold him to be somewhat crazed, (And of the number I myself am one) Yetâyet, he's fondâDivorced! Report's a liar: Pin not thy faith to such a ragged sleeve. Bis. You will believe too soon. Along with me!â Here in Bologna hath a Sir arrived, Andrea's ambassador, who doth demand, In the Duke's name, the hand of Rosamondâ Peganus' royal wardâto fill the place Of fallen Biancaâyour dear sister, friend. Aur. If it were so?â'Tis vulgar!âhe is tired: His palate's dull'd, and fain would have the sauce Of novelty, to tickle itâCurse him! But prithee, friend, what crime hath she committed? Was't boldnessâtreason?âWas't adultery? I'd know what crime. Bis. Her barrenness her crime: No other. Aur. Ha! That was ordain'd by Heaven; Who would not see such beauty bring forth copies Of its own exquisite pattern, to be marred By this vile Dukeâthis known infanticide. I knew no crime could stain my sister's soul: She is the earthly type of purity; And I much more a wretch, to be allied To such a paragonâyet have no touch Of her great virtues. Had she guilty been, 'Twere just that she should fallâas I have fallen; But thus unsullied, to be trampled on Like a stained thingâOh! vengeance, justice! vengeance. Bis. Nayâthis is raving. Aur. Bottle-eloquenceâ I judge you'd so say but you know me not: You've scann'd the dark side of my characterâ Look to the bright! Come with me to the court: I'd speak with this Ambassador. Divorced! There was small cause for my swift banishment: Noneânone, for this! Bis. Aurelio, you forget: We speak i'the street. Aur. Forget?âAll things: myself! This business drives each lesser matter out, Reigning sole tyrant of my memory. To the palace! Friend, I thank thee for thy news; Tho' they be cursed ones. Duke! look to thyself: Treason ere now hath sprung from private wrongâ 'Tis scarcely treason, if the cause be strong. [Exit. Bis. My joy copes with my sorrowâsince this ill Strikes my friend's heart, and proves it noble still. [Exit SCENE II. The same.âA Room in the Palace. Enter Valerio and Rosamond. Val. Sweet Rosamond! our happy days are goneâ It hath been with us, as if our two lives Were branches of one bough, growing together, As meant not to be parted: now a windâ A cruel wind springs up, and sunders quite The one from the other. You are Andrea's bride. Ros. I to that title make not love, Valerio, And would not wear it: but my guardians' will Hath my heart's blindfold homage. See!âthey come. Enter Peganus, Livia, Petronio, Ferdinandâ and other Attendants. Peg. Come hither, noble maidâSaluzzo sends, By this fair Sir's especial agency, His royal commendation to his brideâ His gentle Rosamond: and prays she may, Borne on the dove-wing of fast-flying love, Fanning the swift gale of occasion, And gilded by the sun-beam of bright pomp,â Haste to his arms; and in the sky of state, Be as the morning-star of happiness. What says Bologna's pearl? Liv. Speak, our heart's flower! Ros. What should she sayâwhat should an orphan say, Tho' royal, to the guardians of her days, But duteous words, wherein submission dwells, Figured in meek assent?âHer obedience Shall in the self-same mould as your command Be truly modell'd. Liv. Then, our all but daughter, Look jocund to the heights of sovereignty; For Rosamond must be Duke Andrea's wife. Why seems our son so grave? Val. To your trite question, Madam, a trite reply. Who wears a gem He values, but that, losing it, will grieve? Who in his garden views a favourite flower, But mourns that e'er another's hand should pluck it? Answerâand you are answered. Peg. Wayward boy! Get to thy books. (noise without.) How now? Aur. (without.) Wait here, Bisaccio, and keep off these knaves: I'll enter. Enter Aurelio, (a Servant stopping him.) Serv. Out again! by your leave. Aur. Off, off, thou dirty rag! thou skeleton! thou lack-sixpenny knave! Get to thy fellows. Off, off, and out! [Thrusts Servant out. Pardon, (kneeling) great Sir; most noble lady, pardon; And, pardon, thou fair bud of royal stock, (For in thy face I read thy quality) Who, if thou wed'st this Duke (and rumour's tongues All wag to that high tune) must come to blight, Never to blossom; I crave audience here, And leave to shame this presence with rude speech, That haply needs the file. Have I permission? Peg. You've taken without leave, what now you crave: And we should punish taking, not grant, leave. But since your speech and outside argument Cry both, well-bredâyou have our license, Sir: Proceedâ Aur. (rising). Which is the Duke's ambassador? Pet. That honorable office, mine. Aur. Then, Sir, You come on a dishonorable errand. Would the mad duke be twice a murderer? First, his child's life, and then, his lady's fame! What, both? O, gentle maiden, have a care, Lest you be third sad victim, sacrificed On the lewd altar of his damn'd caprice. Liv. Silence, for shame! Peg. What swaggering rebel thou, That thus speak'st treason 'gainst great royalty? Give good account; or, by the throne I fill! I'll bind thee hand and foot, and send thee thus, With accusation full, unto the Duke. Aur. Do what thou wilt; a brother's love speaks out, Boldly speaks out, even in the throat of death. I am the brother of Saluzzo's Duchess,â Aurelio, Iâthe brother of that sweetest, Dearest, most innocent, lady o'the earth: At whose inviolate door sin never knock'dâ The visible spirit of chastity: O, tis commonâ Gross appetites will famish on fine food. At Zembla, seek the plains of Thessaly; Or Tempe, at the Pole; you'll find them there, Ere justice, or soft-strung humanity, With o'erswollen greatness. Prince, you know me now, And, prythee, grant I've motive for all treason. Peg. Aurelio?âwe have heard of such a man: One whom his sovereign lifted unto honor; But found him nothing honorable. Liv. One who left This dearest sister, with out-poured tears To weep a brother's baseness, and with sighs, Oft shaking the frail walls of her choked heart, To deem him reprobate. Pet And one, 'tis saidâ Aur. Prison thy breath up with thy courtier's lips, Smooth, honey-sugar'd Sirâand mouth not me! You, Sir,âand you, most honor'd Madam,âhave full scope To rate me as you list: you cannot sink me To lower depths of my poor selfâesteem, Than those I drown in. Yet, beseech you, Sirâ Of what rank crime (in substance, or in shadow) Stands she accus'd? Or if not criminalâ And for she's barren, and on this pretence (Since heirless sovereignty lacks much of honor) The Duke would cast herâlet him look at home! Two causes oftimes go to one effect. Beseech you, Sirâwhat crime? Peg. Sir, answer not: The will of royalty is ground enough For royalty's procedure. We are busy: Please you, give way. Aur. Your highness well reminds me: I hasten to the source of this great wrong, And dive i'the fountain head. Nobles, farewell: I've loiter'd long already. Princess Rosamond, Yet, ere I goâFrown not such furrows, Madam!â Upbraid me, I intreat theeâroundly: Nay!â With these same bodiless weapons, air-edged words, Assail me too, I pritheeâbe not single: I am Bianca's brother. Ros. Sir, not I: I wish thee wellâand thy Bianca wellâ Liv. Play housewife with thy tongue, child Rosamond. Why stay you, Sir? You have our leave to go. Aur. You are gracious, Madam: I have heard enough, And have no further cause for tarriance here. I'll to SaluzzoâI have business there, Which, be the road as ridgy mountains rough, Will not be jolted from my memory. [Exit. Peg. This man's for moonlight: it will yet be well Saluzzo know of his vagaries hereâ Mind we record them. Ho! who waits there? Be Enter an Attendant. The strangers gone? Attend. My lordâin furious haste. Peg. They make good speed. Go, see this worthy gentleman bestowed; And, Sir, make freeâour palace is your home. [Exeunt Attendant and Petronio. Hark hither! Ferdinand: go seek my steward, And by this warrant, bid him give thee straight Of gold a liberal purse. Thus furnish'd, ride Post haste upon the high road to Saluzzo, Where overtaking that same gentleman Who late went henceâSignor Aurelio, (Whom you do know) in our name proffer it To his free use, with speech and action fitting: Say somewhat of our sorrowâpity; so: Our knowledge of his needâlightly touch that. Haste, Sir. Fer. It shall be done, my lord. [Exit. Peg. We would not have the kinsman of a princess Lack means; and had on this thought sooner, but For the man's violence, which drove us quite From present matters. Liv. He'll refuse the purse: My life! he willâwhatever be his need. Peg. And rumour speaks that greatâWell! he will choose. And now, our son and prosperous-fortuned charge, Prepare ye as ye may;âthis very noon Must we be travellers. Liv. And good my sonâ Be merry: or not knowing merriment, Learn it of Rosamond. Val. That's wrongly said: For, bound on such a journey, I would have her Teach me unmeasured griefânot merriment. Peg. You're sad, when most you should take joy by the hand, And call her, fellow spirit. Come; Bestir! All things are order'd for good government During our absence; and our deputy Waits at the outer gate, to take due leave. Look gay, bride Rosamondâbe smilers! allâ Our spirits hold their merriest carnival! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A place on the Road to Saluzzo. Enter Aurelio and Bisaccio. Aur. Thus far upon our journeyâand we've kill'd The distance bravely. Said you, 'tis to-morrow That the Duke holds his mockery of a court? Bis. To-morrow, at high noon. Aur. O! I will spur My steed, till blood and foam bathe him all o'er, But I will brave this honor-murderer there, And tell him to the teeth, he is a villain. Oh! my sweet sisterâI have been a wretchâ The veriest wretch that e'er by base excesses Lower'd his humanityâto leave thee thus; Deeming thee safe in a burglarious world, Where innocence may ne'er lock up itself So strongly, but that wrong creeps nigh i'the dark; Breaks up its wardsâand every treasure stolen, Leaves it to blank bereavement. Bis. Yet again, Good friend Aurelio, be more temperate, You will do more with this distemper'd Duke By fair remonstrance, than mad violence. Aur. No more of that, Bisaccio, if you love me. As well you might with your weak-blowing breath Puff 'gainst the roaring wind, as with tame counsel Bear coldly on my wrath. Divorced? Bianca! Why, tho' she be, she shall be nothing fallen: Whenever Virtue is by Vice put down, It rises honor'd by the abasement: Iâ I say it!âwho to Virtue have been truant. Enter Ferdinand. Your pleasure, friend? I've seen you in Bologna. Fer. Thence have I travell'd with post haste to greet you; But well nigh fail'dâyou rode so rapidly. Peganus, Sir, Bologna's sovereign, Pitying the cause that takes you to Saluzzo, And much concern'd for half your sorrows thereâ Part knowing you do lack of golden means, Sends you this purse, and bids you use it freely. Aur. I crave the royal pardon: I had thought He played Sir Rat, and wisely turned his back Upon a falling house. Sir, bid him eat his purse! Ay, like the long-eared king, chew nought but goldâ I'll none of't! Go: his purse will pay your labor. [Exit Ferdinand. Why, this is rare! Enter a Servant. How now! Sirrah: Bring you fresh horses? Serv. They are hard at hand, Sir. Aur. On! then, my friend. The sky portends a storm. Bis. Indeed, it looks foul weather. Aur. Every way: Without, within: i'the welkinâin my fortunes: And it will break; but, happilyânot yet. Hold off, ye clouds o'the air and of my soul! Till I my journey and its end fulfilâ Then, rainâspoutâblazeâand thunder, if ye will! Quick! quick! Bisaccio. [Storm at a distance. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE I. Saluzzo.âA Room of State in the Palace. The Duke seated, surrounded by Gualtier, Lucio, and assembled Lords, Officers, &amp;c. in attendance. Duke. Are all the peers assembled? Luc. All, my Lord: And form (as I may say) a galaxy, A via lactea. Duke. These empty tubs! Are all the peers assembled? Gualt. All, your Highness; And wait upon the business of the court. Duke. Why, that's well said. You're a plain man, my lord: Your speech lacks rhetoricâwe like't the better. Illustrious Sirs!âthe columns whereon rest Our state's high edificeâits strength and grace, Wherefore you are convened, to here proclaim, Were but to dote upon a twice-told tale: Since Curiosity, tho' doors be shut And windows barr'd, will down the chimney dropâ Or smuggle thro' a crevice, to make prey Of matters nice as this we stand upon, And buzz them all abroad. You know the matter? Lords. We do, my lords. Duke. A word then, with your honors: 'Twas you, my lords, that forced us into wedlock:â Would you had been our wife-providers too! So that the hot intemperance of youth, Whose will flows with the current of his blood, Had worn the curb of wisdom. But we chose To be our own purveyor; and therein, Did madly whet the knife that was to strike At the unmailed heart of our own peace. We married for we lovedâ(and that, forsooth, Was but a semptress' cause for matrimony)â And for we knew a lassâa country lass, Whose mirror showed a face men might call fair; Eyes not too dullârose cheeks, and certain dimples Playing round cherry lips, must needs go mad And wed: as if a monarch had no path To the fair vale where Beauty's treasure lies, But through the pitfalls and the gins of marriage! Was it not so? Luc. Truly 'twas so, my lord. Duke And. That's a brave rattle, for a royal fair! Ay, Sirs; purblinded by this imp of love, And past the aid of Reason's optica, We sought not the state's interest, nor our fame; But led by passion, ass-like, by the nose, We married basely: And now, mark the curse!â But, shut thy mouth, Lord Lucio: can't you hear With a closed lip?âNow, mark the curse! my lords;â Inward upbraidings and domestic grief; An unblest bed (the only fruit it bore Dying ere ripeness) public discontent; Vile accusations, and a world beside Of full-fledged ills, the night-birds of the soul, That flew, so many screech-owls, round our throneâ And each a death to peace. Went it not thus? Luc. Faith!âit was pityâfaith!âand yet it did. Duke. Good Sir, are you the crier of the court? Went it not so? A Lord. So, in the public guess; And at your Highness' lack of sweet content, The heart of loyalty was as a fount For sorrow's hidden tears. Duke. Wellâthat might beâ Her eyes showed none. Now, mark the remedy! Whose use to sanction and just exhibition, You, the state's learn'd physicians, here are met. Our riper age, atoning for the raw, Harsh-savor'd folly of unmellow youth, To prudence prompting usâwe have resolved Here to divorce the low-descended partner Of our degraded throne; and thereto tending, We have already, from the papal court, License obtained of holy mother church For this proceedingâAnd, yet more, my lords: By weak half-measures, not to tease the wound Of the galled state; but heal it, once and whollyâ Petronio, our new-styled ambassador, Hath to Bologna gone, where, at the court Of our most royal brother, he demands The hand of princess Rosamond for ours, Whose high-born beauty, rising o'er our throne, Shall make us happy morning; and her youth, Yielding fair promise of posterity, Pull tight the loosen'd cords of sovereignty, Strength'ning the bond of state. Hath this approval? [A murmur of assent. You bless me, Lords. Call in the Duchess, ho! For Duchess is she, till she be divorced. [Exeunt several Attendants. So, Duchess shall she ever be, God wot! (Aside.) Tush! Tush! My lords, It was a stormy night. Gual. A fearful night: The elm-uprooting hurricane made waste In all the neighbouring groves. Duke. But nowâbehold, From yonder casement's eastward-peering eye, Those golden clouds, fair-weather harbingers, In sunny ridges lying all along, Like to a field new mown. It seems, my lords, A happy omen of Saluzzo's weal In these near-neighbour changes. Higher! Look! 1st Courtier. Do you not mark with what a hard-heart coldness His Highness heaps these griefs upon Bianca? And for what cause? Think you his reason's clear? 2nd Court. I know not what to think: 'tis not his nature. Here comes the lady. Attend. (without) Way there, for the Duchess! Duke. Come, come, my lords! we stay too long i'the clouds. Now, stern dissembling be my onward game; Tho' tender pity, with an earnest voice, Cry in the ear of love. (Aside.) Enter Bianca, attended. Your servantâMadam. Bian. Mine, that titleâSir: And here I come, to take my last discharge; Tho' heaven is witness, I've betray'd no trustâ Shrunk from no service; but have been as true, As constant minister to your high will, As e'er was slave to master. Duke. Is't complaint? Bian. No, my good lord. Duke. Ladyâyou are most wise, Not to complain in vain; for vain complaint Is the besetting sin of all your sex; So, not complaining vainly, you do show Your sex a glass, wherein their own souls seeing, They may behold where nature sits awryâ And set the strings of their behaviour right. Sirs!âread the sacred instrument aloud. Officer (reads). We, the holy successor of St. Peterâ delegate of God; in compliance with the request of our obedient son Andrea, Duke of Saluzzoâholding in due regard the interests and welfare of both prince and people; do hereby give authority, by virtue of our divine rightâto make null our said son's marriage with the lady Bianca, his Duchess; who is hereby deprived of all privilege and property thereto appertainingâexcepting whatsoever she may have brought to him in dowry. Duke. More!âthere is more? Officer. The rest are forms, my Lord. Duke. Why, thenâthe forms are like the squirrel's tail, Longer than all the body. You have heard, Bianca, Rome's directing ordinance: And what the church ordains, the state approvingâ The state's assembled nobles here have set The seal to this divorce: therefore, good lady, You are no more the Duchess of Saluzzo. You know the rest:âyour proud successor comesâ Proud, and by birth, right worthy of a throneâ E'en whilst I speak, from fair Bologna hither. Hence with your nuptial dowerâa thing, I ween, Of easy burthenâhence!âand on the plains Choose thee an equal helpmate, and no more Live in these gaudy dreams. Bian. Duchess no more? Duke Andrea's wife no more!âAh! there's the wound, The only wound at which Bianca bleeds. Sir, I obey: but never think, my Lord, I am so basely natured, as to soil The vessel of your choice: no mean alliance Shall sully even the outcast of your throne. Yet will I not pine in sad widow-weeds; But make a husband of my memoryâ And still in contemplation be your bride. Farewell, my Lord! Duke. Your dowerâforget not that! Bian. My heart, and the poor beauty you commended. The first, my lord, defies all other hands, Save that, the iron one of death, to wrest it From where it once was treasured: and the wreck Of the unworthy last, is scarcely worth Its hapless owner's wearing. Duke. Wellâaway! Retain the regal gew-gaws which you wear; And let them be as foppish monitorsâ As counsellors by contrast. Go: an escort Waits i'the court-yard, to conduct you forth Safe to old Manso's arms. Bian. I need no escort. For these proud ornamentsâI valued them But as the precious tokens of your love, Which lost, they're valueless. And here, my Lord, Low at your feet, I lay this jewell'd crown, Unmeet to be a wretch's diadem, Who could but dull its bright gems with her tears: And here the ring, within whose golden round, Pure emblem of pure love, my very soul Hath been engirded: last, this princely robe Cast I aside, and, lo, my russet gown! [She lets fall her robe, discovering a rustic vest beneath. Duke. (aside.) Now, heaven, put on the vestiture of earth! Stars, leave your brightness, and be dull as fogs! And thou, high treasury of all light's wealth, Brave palace metropolitan of fire, Wrap thee in smoke! She is a paragon! Bian. Your highness sees I have no need of escort; None will molest a poor-clad traveller. Again, my Lord, farewell; with her you wed May you clasp close domestic happiness And out-door honor! 'tis my prayer: farewell. [Exit. Duke. Come hither, Gualtier. Re-enter Bianca. Ha, return'd! What's this? Bian. (kneeling) My Lord, I crave some parting sign of peace: But if to be a beggar in such sort Be rudeness, pray you the petition hold As if ne'er made. Duke. Forbid it, gallantry! (kisses her) Go, then, Bianca: you depart with honor, Spotless in fame;âstain-free. Bian. Happy! it lives Warm on my brow: there stamp it, Memory! [Exit. Duke (aside). She's firmâshe's proofâunchanging diamond, all! 'Tis me, and not my dukedom, that she loves. My purpose faintsâNo tears? A miracle! 1st Noble. Bethink your highnessâis't not cruelty? 2nd Noble. O! call her back, my lord! Duke. Now, death of grace! Must we be babe, and take to leading-strings? Is power to have no will?âWe have the will; Ayâand the power o'eradded to the will: And since we have the power, 'thout which the will Stands cypher-likeâwe will do that we will! Faith! I am rousedâI lack'd this grinding-stone, To sharp my blunted resolution. Gualtier, at distance, follow her that's gone: Deem her the only daughter of your age; Unto the fancy raise your pitch of love; Then let your care e'en overtop that love, And guard her from the shadow of mishap. But, be not known her escort: Lurk! manâlurk! Ayâand be secret! Gual. Ever were she shielded As I will shield herâwere it wrought of wax, And underneath the fiery tropic sunâ Her beauty should not blench for't. Duke. Sir, you're prudence. Gual. (aside) I know not what this means: nor can I strain My uninstructed wit, unto the heights Cloud-capt of his intent. Time will show all. [Exit. Duke. Men muse upon't. Why, how now? Lucioâ That, there, your head, hangs idle as a bell Without its clapper. What's the matter, Sir? Luc. Your highness treats me as I were your fool, And not your late ambassador. Duke. Good! now: That's a wide start from the point blank of truth: But you are practisedâsince you saw the Pope. You've named your own addition; therefore, wear it! My lords! part actors and part audience hereâ We thank you for your pains; and nothing doubt, That when your wisdoms do revolve upon't, You will perceive the fitness of this business. Our play is doneâYour Lordships are dismiss'd. As the Nobles, &amp;c. are going, enter Aurelio. Stay! stay! my lords: another scene's to act, Which, to say truth, had given our brain the slip. Take breath, great actor! speak! we give the cue. Aur. Where is my sister? thou pernicious Duke! Or thro' rain, thunder, and the pitch-black night, Say, have I ridden in vain? The raven Rumour Croak'd my disgrace where'er I passed along; And every day-break laborer, loud speaking Of some divorce, did rudely cast my soul Beneath his feetâand trample on't. I see, I see: the mock is done!âand she, twin life Of mine! hath gone dishonor'd forth.âIs't not As I have said? Speak, thou Mahometan! Duke. Thou art a very foolish, light young man, Whose humor we can whistle on and off, E'en falcon-like, to prey on what we will. Sir! you know nothing of our bosom councils: And wiser 'twere, by holding of your peace, To put a garment (albeit 'tis but slight) O'er ignorance; than by pie-chattering thus, To strip it starkly naked. Sir; your humors First broke the chain that bound our heart to youâ And 'tis not to be mended by the like. Aur. There is no need: my thoughts shall all break out! Where is the child that should be solace now To her that bore't?âa bud upon the stem Of that kill'd flowerâher honor? Answer! Duke. Ayâpinch your brows! there is a spot of earth Could borrow from innocent blood a lavish tongue, Whose accusations from your name should pluck All reputation, and your crown beat off With more than Titan's armâscatter your state With typhon breath:âhear!âhear! Infanticide! [The Lords draw their swords. Ha! scabbards empty? So be mine condition'd! (Draws.) Duke. Put up your swords! my lords: let sleep strong steel! If that which is, were that which ought to be, This were too good a world. Where's the mad dog That will not bite his master? Ha! Ha! Ha! Aur. Laugh you? great Sir: you sham high spirits well. Duke. They're genuine spirits, Sirâand keep the bead. We somewhat did predict this visitation; And, tickled with our goodly augury, Are fain to laugh. Aur. Sure, there's another cause? The vision of a second bridal-bed, Wherein to sport, in close perspective lies; And downward from the region of the brain Chasing the blood, makes frolic in your heart, That vents itself in laughter. Duke. In faith, Sir, you speak well: for in our youth We have not, by the surfeit of strong drink, So lethargied and apoplex'd our blood, As to bring on the soul's paralysis; And be insensible to what hath charm'd, If poets lie not (but, be sure!â they lie) The sense of godsâthe excellence of woman! We have not raked and revell'd life away; Disgraced our kindredâfrom our fortunes stript Anticipation's halo; none of this! But, we disdain such parleying with a subject: Our condescension stoops too near the earth. Go, mend thy life! If you Bianca seekâ The lady late divorcedâand so we guessâ You'll find her at a fitting residenceâ The cottage of her sire. Come with me! Lords. Aurelio (that's your name?) we leave you here Another grumbler, for good company: Cherish him, Sir: men call himâLucio; But he, but now, hath dubb'd himselfâcourt-fool! [Exit Duke, with all but Lucio and Aurelio. Aur. Gods! there is something awes me in this man: He wears a majesty that strikes men dumb. But, Vengeance! write me in thy bookâand cry, This marriage shall not be! Luc. Aurelio! Aur. Lord Lucio?âor my memory else is a sieve. Luc. The Duke reminded you of my name, Sir, when, bethinking him of his privilege, he was pleased to call me grumbler. Aur. You appear not overburthened with estimation of the Duke, my lord. Luc. In fidelity, SirâI have no cause: for not only hath he displaced me for a two-legged jack in the late embassy to Bolognaâ Aur. A scurvy employment and a villanous errand! In missing that, your lordship suffered no derogation from honor. Luc. Sir! though the errand be ill, the supersedence is not good. And, moreoverâhe hath of late molested me by a certain rude superfluity of raillery; he took offence at my shadow and demurred to my dressâand when I would have saluted his hand, he proffered me his glove. Yea! but nowâinstant nowâhath he called me, tub, rattle court-crier, bell-without-clapper, and court-fool!âIs this respect? Aur. Ha!âHow doth your fair wife, my lord? Luc. Pshaw! If a man have a sore place, it is sure to be rubbed. There again is my honor stintedâshe is what she should not beâand my Lord Duke knows it. Aur. Well! well! my lord: both our injuries cry aloud âyour's with a cuckow voice. Luc. Sir, I could never abide the cuckow. I cannot hear the creature's duplex vociferation, but I put my hand to my forehead. Sirâfarewell! Remember me for your friendâwe have bitter wrongs.âCourt-fool!âCourt-fool! Aur. I will think upon it: your Lordship's servant! [Exit Lucio. Now, but I much despise this simple lord, I do believe, that on his jealousy (Since, 'tis received abroad, Duke Andrea's foot Treads in his private garden) I could work So strongly, as to goad him into treason; Or to some sneaking vengeanceâNo! I'll try What prayer may do, to force this ducal Sir, This half-way madman, all made up of lunesâ To take th'arrest from off Bianca's honor:â If nothingâand he seek a second brideâ Myself may at the altar play the priest, And marry him to death! Enter several Servants. 1st Serv. By your leave, Sir: His Highness hath much blamed us for admitting you so freely; and he now begs you will command his approbation, by ensuring your absence. 2nd Serv. Will you go, Sir? Aur. You curs! Have you forgotten whom I am? Am I not he who, next the Duke, was your chief and liberal patron? You lifted the hat to me; you cringed to me; you fed on me: you hailed my faintest smile as a sun that gave warmth and light to your fortunesâAnd, now: you face me with bravery; and with glib tongues, bid meâgo!â as if respect in inferiors had no longer any grace. Sirrahs! I go at my leisure. Hence with you! or I will flatter those calves' heads of yours to the shape of apes' sconces. Begone!âDogs! [Exeunt Servants. I taste the world. Now, haste swift-wing my feet! Till I a sire and dearest sister greet. [Exit. SCENE II. Manso's residence in the Country. A garden. Enter several Domestics. 1st Dom. Is our master, say you, gone to meet his daughter, the Duchess? 2nd Dom. Must you have repetition? dull fellow! I say to you, he isâand will return before the hour-glass shall have done dribbling. But you may call her Duchess no longer, since she is now no Duke's wifeâand by reason, moreover, that Manso has expressly forbidden this great word, Duchess. They say the Duke is crack-witted, and has turned her out-door. [Shouts without. 3rd Dom. Ha, by St. Mark! and here they are. The whole village abroad to welcome her!âStand aside! Stand aside! Enter Manso, leading in Bianca. Man. That's my brave daughter! This is Roman bearing. Now are you loftier in your old sire's eyes, Than did you reign an emperor's emperorâ First star of state's high constellation. My most dear child! my heroineâBianca! Bian. Had my soul been the merest reed in strength, These kindly greetings and heart-reckonings Of honest and school-fellow country folk, Had put a strain of oak in't. I'm content: But this I knowâDuke Andrea well may tempt A greater to his throne: but let him peer Into the world's wide casketâhe will find No gem of love like mine. That jewel most precious, His reason, guard, O Heaven! for I do fear Some mystic passion, lurking like a thief In his great mind, is fain to pilfer it. Man. It is the current credenceâAh! dear daughter, He shall not find thy mateâBut cheer theeâcheer! Your mistress, fellows: tender her commands Nearer than mine!âCome hither, Anthony. [Whispers one, who goes out. Bian. These are old faces. Man. All: I love to keep Such near meâthey are memory's nourishers. Re-enter Servant, with a Box. Guess you what's here? (opens the chest.) Bian. Some treasure is't? Man. A mine! Wherein I have been wont to dig most deep For the rich ore of fond reflection: Look! 'Tis the rustic scarf which you let drop Even on the threshold, when your foot first sprang Into the ducal chariot. Even then, Did my prophetic heart hold argument: The wheel of my child's fortunes now runs up A heaven-tending hill: but when at height, It will recoil, and down the vale again! With moreâmuch more. I've treasured it for needâ For loveâWhy, there! upon your shoulders, girl.â Now, as before, you lend its plainness beautyâ Would you had ne'er worn richer! Bian. What a cloud Of memories hang around this little scarf! O! it would make a world of solitude, And people it with thoughts! 'Twas this I wore When Andrea knelt: as I do gaze upon it, This, my apparel ere my state was gain'd, Recalls it, lostâwith far more eloquence, Than could the mantle of my sovereignty He proffered, to be my remembrancer. Man. Come! come! it is a time for merriment: Once more my attributes of sire blush full! Call in the villagers! Now, song and foot-mirth Welcome our village queen, who now puts on Her crown again! The Villagers enter. Bian. Welcome! kind friendsâAll welcome! Aurelio appears in the back ground. 1st Villager, (sings) The stork resumes her ancient tower; The nightingale her thicket's boss: The swallow her worn-window bower; The red-breast her old oak-trunk's moss: Alas! for rain and wind and cold, That made them quit their mansions old. Wreath! wreath a coronet of roses! Blooms summer-fair as earth discloses To the sun's lavish eye: With roses crown our rose-sweet queen! A bird that to her home serene Returns, no more to fly! Crown with fair flowers a fairer one! See!â'tis done. [They crown Bianca with a wreath of roses. Then a danceâduring which Aurelio mingles with the villagers. Man. Thanks, my good friends! My heart is all so full Of surfeiting content, it could contain No more. Bian. No more? Man. No more! You'd name Aurelio? I feel a rising nausea even here. No more! I would not have that outcast by: He's wild; he's lewdâand from my age half plucks The evergreen of honor. No! no! no! Being here, his sight, upstirring memory, Would blight the bloom o'the hour. Aur. (Advancing, as the Villagers, &amp;c. exeunt.) He's here to do't!â [Bianca throws herself into Aurelio's arms. Closer, dear sister!âpress my inmost heart!â Sir, he is here: but, oh! another man Than that Aurelio who hath been so long A recreant to grace. Of Dissipation's cup I've drunk unto the leesâand find each dreg So bitter, that my pleasure-palled lip Shall touch the brim no more. Turn not away! Bian. You must not, Sir: he never made false vows. Let your heart take the character he quits, And play the prodigal!âI'm now most happy. Man. Sir, there's a father's hand: seal your resolve Of words, with action's firm impression, And take his heart along with't. Aur. Both are mine, then. But still there's cause for all our cheeks to burn With shame's deep sense of grief: What song was this? What ill-timed cunning of time-beating feet? Is not the honour of our lifted house Cast into dust? Stand we not here disgraced? Has not that lady, your proud daughter, Sirâ My royal sisterâbeen dishonor-steep'd? Divorced! degraded! sent an outcast forthâ The victim of a light-wit fantasy!â Alone, unescortedâwithout attendance, Save that of her own soul's great fortitude? Is't not all so?âBy Heaven! I'm all amaze, To see you thus unmoved by that which shakes My else strong-seated heart. Bian. Fair now! my brotherâ Leave the fond theme: I do not find dishonour, Having a palace and a kingdom here. Man. Discretion hath no part in you, Aurelio: As father and as brother, we may feel; (Tho' I draw nought of sorrow from this chance) But we must bear as subjects. Aur. Ay!âAs assesâ Who have no power to fling their burthen off: But even Sir Balaam kicks. We will not bear Shame's panniers, laden with a madman's freaks! Enter a Messenger. Mess. Lives there a gentleman, named Manso, here? Man. Yes, Sir. Mess. (shewing a letter.) This from the Duke; 'tis for his daughter. Aur. Sirrah! your knee: your knee!âUnmannerly! There stands the ladyâyou must know her well. Your knee! I say. [The Messenger kneels, and delivers the letter to Bianca. Man. Be gentler, good Aurelio. Bian. 'Tis well: say to his highness, these commands Shall have no letter, howsoe'er exact, On which obedience waits not. (Exit Mess.) His great presence Will fill our house with honour. Aur. Presence!âhis? Bian. Please you, Sireâread. Manso (reading the letter). To the lady Bianca, Know, lady, it will shortly be our pleasure to visit you in your retirement, being fain to prove that we wear not the shackles of overweening pride; and that, although we have deemed it fitting to divorce you from the gauds of state, you still retain some place in our affections. Receive us in your humblest garb: and remember that we come a beggar to your condescension. Let Manso know of thisâand (if you will) Aurelio: but be mindful, that we desire no society but yours. Andrea. Be't so; my daughter is too near to honor, To make this visitation dangerous. Whatever be the cause (and sure 'tis strange, And of a piece with's former waywardness) I will give orders for strict secrecy. And, hear me, son: you are Duke Andrea's subject, So, tender your allegiance narrowly, Or lose my love. Bianca, come with me: Leave him to tune his thoughts to loyalty. Bian. Nay, nay; come in with us; you're pale and weary. Aur. In faith I am: I'll see you presently. Bian. We have a world to talk of; be not long. [Exeunt Manso and Bianca. Aur. I could believe I walked upon my head; That this is not my hand; and this broad light Nothing but darkness. Andrea coming hither! Affectionsâbeggarâcondescension, And if you will, Aurelio. None but hers? Faith, madness is a catching malady!â Mine too, mine too! Duke Andrea, if you please; There should be three to make society. But what to think? O, for a prey-bird's eye, To pierce the distance of this mystery! Let's see, let's see; I think not healthfully; My mind lies in the sickness of fatigue, And sleep must physic it. Let be what may, Unless my soul grow dotard to disgrace, There yet shall come no other in her place. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE I. Saluzzo.âA room in the Palace. Enter the Duke (reading a letter) attended; and a Messenger. Duke. Sir, the contents are welcome. By this hour, Bologna and our sister, with their charge, Are far upon their journey. Sir, we thank you. [Exit Messenger. Sirrahs, attend the prince's messenger. [Exeunt Attend. Well, Lady Rosamond, whom I so oft, Unknown, have seen; we shall exalt thee now To the high level of thy noble birthright. And here is matter of Aurelio too,â âMurder,â âcaprice,â damnation-qualified? Good now, good now! by troth, I like the man: There's virtue in him I will yet pluck out, And plant i'the state. Heaven bless thee! good old lord. Enter Gualtier. How sped the downfall'n lady on her journey? Gual. Sir, 'twas a sight to turn the heart to tears, And drain it all through eyes. As on she past, The silent populace attended her; And some threw flowers and vestments in her path, As if they deem'd the hard earth all too rough To meet the fairy pressure of her feet; Some bless'd her with such prayers as fly to heaven; Others knelt low, and kiss'd her small white hand; And one, her garment's hem: whilst she on all Smiled benediction, paying coin for coin, Of the heart's stamp. Old Manso by the way Met herâand there, my lord, 's an end to words: Such meetings must find painters in deep thoughtsâ The tongue's too poor a dauber. Duke. Say you so? Now, by my dignities! each soul who paid This homage, be he ne'er so base-derived, Reigns in my dear heart's-blood. Gual. What says your highness? Duke. We say, my Lord, that you do paint this well. Pray you, Sirâtell: where strays that nobleman Who lards his rhetoric with shrugs and starts He takes for action? Gual. Mean you Lucio, Sir, I know not. Duke. You have hit the nailâhe! he! The mopsey gentleman is wrath, forsooth! Farewell, my lord: and should you see his grace, Bid him keep owlsâfor better company. [Exit Gual. Enter a Messenger. Another Mercury! Your Godship's news? Mes. The lady bows unto your highness' will. Duke. What will? sweet Sir! Mes. Your highness only knows. Duke. Look'd she in grief? Mes. In grief's true opposite. Duke. In anger? Mes. If within her heart dwelt wrath, Its banner nought advanced in her face. Duke. Wordsâand not sentences! Saw you Manso too? Mes. I do believe so. Duke. Was Aurelio there? Him you should knowâsince he was once o'the court. Mes. My lordâhe was: and forced me to kneel down I'the very dust; and so deliver up Your letter to my lady. Duke. That was brave! (aside.) Friend! had it been i'the mire, you had done well To kneel: it adds not to your honor's page, That you did need the teachingâSir! a king, To whom the knees of all his subjects drop, May to a beauteous woman bend his ownâ And rise up, twice a king!âHence!âand be wiser. [Exit Messenger. Oh!âhow thick melancholy's misty sea Beats round this flowerless island of my thought! Sure I'm a wanton spendthrift with my bliss, Wasting it all for nought? And yetânot so: There's still a test that must be undergone, Ere I can clasp her beauty to my heartâ And in the fulness of extreme content CryâIt is mine, and not my sovereignty's! Doth she not bury pride in solitude, And curse me there?âShe must abroad again: Ay! in my palace, on her rival tendâ And trim the bride, and at the marriage-feast Be as a handmaid: upon which design I, in the spirit of my letter, go A suitor to Bianca. If she yield, And in this ending trial, her love's flower Shed not a leaf of its enduring bloomâ Such bliss comes on her, that her each day's life Shall be high paradise! I've lived too long In love's mere dreamâI would have love itself. Visions, avaunt! Reality for me! [Exit. SCENE II. Manso's Residence in the Country.âA Garden. Enter Aurelio. Aur. Bisaccioâfor thy timely counsel now! The sudden sickness that did lay thee down, Struck at my dear'st of health. What's to be thought? Andrea comes here to-dayâbut wherefore comes, I may as little dream, as why the wind Blows here, or there; now on the lofty pine tops, And now on the shrub o'the vale: for all his doings Are, like the wind, mad-wild. So, let him come; And be the event the guide of my designs. He hath fill'd full our cup of injury; His lustful lunacy hath done its worstâ And degradation on my sister's head Hath pour'd its seventh vial. Patience! patience! Enter Manso, hastily. Man. Begone, Aurelio: for his highness comesâ A sun shorn of his beams; in plain-life garb, On footâpoorly attended. Sir, begone! Lest your imprudence play allegiance falseâ And what is bad, make worst. Aur. Shorn of his beams? Stript of his plumes, good father, you would say: And, gods! had he one gaudy feather on, I'm in a cue to pluck it. Man. Chain thy tongue, Aurelio; or my disapprovement's weight Lights heavy on thee. Aur. Therefore am I dumb: Yet would I seek the purport of this visit, Did I not know your knowledge is in that As blank as mine. Man. 'Tis shrewdly in my guess: And though I grieve, for my dear daughter's sake, His highness is so wayward, should he bid Her presence at his nuptials, I, poor subject! Might not cryâNay. Aur. Her presence? Shame of shames! He will notâcannotâshall notâdare not do't! O! I would rather beg by the road side, And stand with cap in hand to country louts, Than have a sister so dishonoured. Her presenceâat his nuptials?âthought I thatâ Man. Silence! away! for yonder comes the Duke. Aur. No! I'll not stir; not were he thrice a Duke! My wrongs upon my heart, a giant fallen, Like like an Etna, which its thousand throes Cannot shake off; but their commotion shall Throw dust upon this Duke. I will not stir! Man. Then, rest a mule! Sir Wilful: be the assassin For ever of your fortunes! I will go And bid Bianca put on readiness: But, ere I hence, this in your thought installâ 'Tis by the Duke that you must rise, or fall. [Exit. Aur. My dear, my very dearâmy sweet Bianca! My childhood's fellow bud! my youth's twin flower! My manhood's pride! whose rise to sovereignty Did make me almost deem myself a king, In one so loved being crown'd: now must she fall Beneath whate'er she wasâand from a queen, Turn humble follower. Men point and cryâ There goes the man, whose sister was the Duchess! Now shall it beâwhose sister, Duchess once, Is now a Duchess' menial! Oâthis wounds: The thought's a dagger, that doth stab my life! No more of thought: but to its sickness, let Action be remedy! Enter Duke Andrea. Duke. This way went Mansoâ How now! who thus on our desired privacy Thrusts trespass? Aur. One who thinks of honour, as The jewel of man's soul; and him who steals That precious ornament of each day's life, As vilest of all robbers. Sir, you know me. Duke. Fair Signor!âyour allowance. Yet, forsooth, We might have prophesied your presence here: Like-feather'd birds will flockâand nearly by, Met we one lordâone LucioâO! a man Who feasts upon his discontent; and swears His wife was once the chastest icicleâ Until ourselfâan over-fiery sunâ Did thaw the frost-work of her chastity. How are wise men deceived! Sir, you and he, For all we know, are the sole malcontents Of our poor court: 'tis fit ye herd together. Aur. Duke of Saluzzo! I have yet to learn What's in me, or about me, that you thus Would void contempt upon me: is he coward? Knave? idiot? dolt? block? fool? that thus you use Aurelio for a jest. To me, what's Lucio? I have a sisterâa dear sister, Duke! To whom you have done wrongâflint-hearted wrong; Whose child men pity, when they talk of murderâ Duke. By our crown'd head! hint but the thought again, And murder pitiless shall fright the hour, Even on the ground we treadâThus ring great bells. Aur. A sister whom you found most lowly happy, And chose her virtue for an ornament Wherewith to deck your greatness; whom you late Have banish'd from your throneâmade her a by-word For all dishonour; and whose low-fallen heart You seek to gall afresh. Duke. A conjuror! Good Sir, begin: cast magic at the sun! And to the moon, be as another Hecate, Until she grow bewitch'd! What necromancy Gives you such insight into this close heart, That from its deep recess you'd pluck intent, And throw it in our ears? Aur. Then, if I errâ Why comes Duke Andrea hither?âto what endâ Duke. Duke Andrea keeps his counsel, and were dumb Unto a far more cunning catechist Than thou canst prove: Bianca's will's her own, And she will use itâ'tis a woman's way.â Manso, whatâho!âSignor Aurelio, Have we your leave to move? it is but fit A sovereign bend his knee, and to a subject CryâSir, permission!âManso!âWhy not speak? Is your tongue's quiver empty? Faith! that's sad.â Manso! I say. Enter Manso. You're welcome, good old friend: This gentleman's not best of companyâ His wit lacks words, and his few words lack wit: He is not pleasured, Sir: You seeâhe frowns. Manso. My son, great duke, is rash and choleric: I pray you, pardon him. My humble roof Doth from your presence draw a dignity, That should write palace o'er its lowliness. Will't please you see Bianca? Duke. Even so: But first, we'll read gay nature in yon flowers: Survey the garden growthâwe have, indeed, A love for flowers. Ha! Manso, 'tis well thought: There is to be a marriage-rite to-morrow, And we require your presence at the same: What say you? Aur. (aside). He'll not go: my kindred heart Cries that. Manso. My lord, I have long been In the wide world an unseen eremite, And would continue hermit. May it please you, Therefore, to pardon me? Aur. (aside). My life, he would not! Duke. We must command, then: as you'd have your prince Hold you of clear allegianceâSir, be there! Manso. Entreaty and command, in nothing like, Claim unlike answer; at your Highness' bidding, Old Manso shall forego his solitude, And for awhile play courtier. Aur. Doing that, The father smiles upon his daughter's shame; And age sets seal unto the contumely, That stabs the fame of youthâYou're mad to go! Duke. Would you be madman too, Aurelio, For an odd guest we shall have room enough: Meanwhile, rail as you will. Come, Sirâthe flowers! And after them, the lady of these bowers! [Exeunt Duke and Manso. Aur. Shall it be steel, or poison? shall itâFool! I live in words which, like the thoughts that breed them, Are all disjoint; and tho' to one goal tending, Start from no fixed point: My meditations Hang all upon the tip-top branch of doubt, And by conjecture's wind blown to and fro, Cling to no order. I'll observe this meeting; And as it bodes my sister good, or ill, So shape my deedsâher peace my motive still. [Exit. SCENE III. The same.âAnother part of the Garden. Enter Bianca. Bian. There hangs a heavy weight upon my heart, And, faith! I think, 't will break. On what new harshness Is the Duke bent, that to my humble home He comes, with such a still, mysterious air? Whate'er his will, hold constancy! my soul; And tho' divorced, still let obedience be The unmoving load-star of my storm-beat heart! I do believe his mind's delusion-warp'd; And the blank credence, for these many wrongs, Pleads my soul's pardon passing mournfully. It is the very day of all the year On which my mother died, and my dear child Fell prey to ruffian handsâHush! hush! what footsteps? The theme is treason. You sweet souls in heaven! Look down and bless me: I am as a lark That long hath flown too high, singing of joy, And light at last upon deceiving waves, That drown meâsong and all. I will endure Even as I love; and if my heart should breakâ Be pity a mute mourner at my grave, And tears my transient, only chronicles! Enter Duke Andrea, behind. Duke. To the Nymph president of these retreats, Health and perennial beauty! Note, Bianca, That we do sort our garments with the sceneâ With time and circumstance. Who now, fair soul! Would take us for the things of state we are? Bian. I seem but as I am, my dreaded liegeâ And. Say you?âWhat were we nowâAy! what, Biancaâ Did we not in ourselvesâwithin, withinâ Close nobleness? No more than what we seem. The outward's nothing, be it ne'er so rich; For if the gem which in the gold is set Be flawed, the encircling furnishment but draws Men's eyes to note the fenced worthlessness Of that which should be precious.âWell! Bianca: Think you our presence here a miracle? Bian. Indeed, my lord, you do your servant honor, Whose rich possession came not in her dreams; And much I marvel, what in one so poor You can be beggar for. Duke. Had thy child lived, Would she not, even in this passing hour, Have been the opening flower of seventeen summers? Bian. My lord, be merciful: nor touch a string Whose trembling shakes my heart. Duke. Another, then:â But prithee, Lady, if you love us still, Turn not accuserâsuch that tear proclaims you: 'Tis a false witnessâstrangle it!âIs not This ground, the very earth whereon you stood, When, to your beauty heart-sick suppliant, Your unwise sovereign knelt? Bian. Indeed, unwiseâ As the sad after proved, to my heart's sorrow: But yet, to me it stands for hallow'd ground! And here I kneel, and on the blessed sod Print true-love's kiss! Duke. Rise! lovely lady!âriseâ By heaven! it wants but little, my resolve Here down breaks all at once, unperfected Leaving the cloud-break of my jealous doubtsâ Peace, Heart! (Aside) Bianca, on this ill-starr'd spot, Stand we again your suitor. Bian. And I swear, Even by that kiss which sealed my banishment, To be in all your servant, my great lord! Duke. For the state's exigence, you wot, we've chosen A noble lady for our royal bride: To-morrow sees the espousals; and whereas, Your taste, industrious, to our festivals Hath given a name for a most matchless order, Where splendor lives in regularityâ And plenty, in arrangement right displayed, Shows not o'erfull profusion: such fair fame, By giddy deference to stranger hands, We would not on such great occasion perilâ And so, we come your suitor: so it please you To be high mistress of these ceremonies, Your condescension shall for ever bind us, And in our heart reap thanks. Bian. Oh!âwillingly! And much my pride, that my poor excellence Lives in your memory: 't will be my joy To rule a festival wherein my feast Shall be the richest; where my eyes may take Their sweet repast upon my sovereign's face, And never surfeit. Duke. Still so diamond-constant? (Aside) Yet further, Lady: if you'd not disdain To wear this same apparel you have on, Tho' haply it may lack of ceremony, You will enhance twofold our gratitude: For the dress likes us; and tho' plain, perchance, Suits well your state: and what is fit, is fair; So, wear it at the festival. Bian. In what garb Pleases my lord, I am content to come. Duke. Pride-proof? O, Heavens! you've made her heart the soil, Where only grows that flower, humility. (Aside.) You have our thanks, Bianca: we had thought Y'had been too proud. Bian. I, proud? Bianca, proud? When was I proud? Never, but in your favor, With which complying, I am still most proud. It is not else than fitting, that I, who In high-born presences have sat so oft In garb pre-eminent, should now stand clothed In vesture more my birthright, and give place To self-entitled splendors: it shall be As my lord wills. Duke. And now, my soul! end all. (Aside.) Yet one entreatyâand we beg no more; The bride is a young stranger to our home; And if't will please you grant her such kind tendance As to yourself 'mid strangers would be welcome, The height of our free gratitude shall pass Whate'er men deem of thankfulness. Bian. So much Will I perform; and in the doing find Pleasure, to constitute reward enough For greater service. Duke. Why, thenâ'tis past! And glibly speed, ye onward-coming hours! To throne my joy i'the skies. (Aside). Farewell! Biancaâ You've bound us wholly: o'ertrip all delay! To-morrow shall be twice a wedding day. [Exit. Bian. Now, from your fount, gush tears! He tries me keenly: But I will prove what deep devotedness Lives in a woman's heartâAurelio? then, Weak evidence! unto your source again; Eyes, be not seen to weep! Enter Aurelio. Aur. Sister, I come To learn what dire offence Bianca finds In her Aurelio, that by this submission To petty tyranny (for certain words Have in his ears been traitors to your greatness) She bids Derision's finger wag against him, As one who, unavenging, suffers wrong And winks upon dishonorâWhy thus be Slave of a mad caprice? Bian. I've but one answer: Duke Andrea is the lord of all my soul, And what he wills, I do. Why, grant he's madâ (And I do fear wild dreams feed on his brain) I by refusals should but make ill worseâ And wound, where I should heal. Aur. Then was I mad, When I did think disgrace upon our house Had wreak'd her worst: the last woe is not spent! Heaven help us! then: I'll dig a cave i'the earth, And buried there, leave shame unto the sun And seek my peace in darkness. Enter Manso. Man. Haste! my daughter: The Duke would see us by to-morrow's dawn. Aurelio, you will not fail the feast, If you have either loyalty, or love or sire, or sister. Bian. Prithee come, Aurelio: And if you'd be the comforter of wrongs, 'Twere treason 'gainst the Duke and death to me E'er to revenge, you'll comeâI know you'll come. Man. Leave him at once: the time a bankrupt grows, Whilst we stand loitering. Bian. Say you'll come, Aurelio. Aur. I willâI will. Bian. Now, father, I will haste As I were speeding to my throne again. [Exeunt Manso and Bianca. Aur. I'm pledg'd, then, to this sceneâand e'en will trick Myself in gay apparel, and put on A bright face on the darkness of the matter. By violence, I wound Bianca's heart Far more than heal her honor. Should he load her With new indignities, i'the midst of the court Will I stand up, and make a brother's love Her shield and panoply. Come weal, come woe, Her honor is my lifeâto that I grow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE I. The Way leading to the Palace of Saluzzo. Enter Two Gentlemen. 1st Gent. Is Bianca, then, at court? 2nd Gent. So cries report; and, moreover, puts on a semblance of credibility in the utterance. But rumours, indeed, fill the air like gossamers, that whilst we stay catching at one, we are overflown by a hundred others. 1st Gent. I have heard it stoutly maintained, that both Manso and Aurelio will be guests at the festival: but this I consider to be without the compass of belief. 2nd Gent. Well, Sir; matters go in the cloak of mystery âand we that are mere out-door observers, must be content to pin our credence to its skirts. The great ones from Bologna journey warily: the populace have attended them these two hours, and fare well nigh mad to behold their new duchess. 'Tis strange they are not come. 1st Gent. They reposed last night at his highness' country-house, and, I doubt not, will be here, ere time shall have told the minutes of another hour. Hark! (Guns without and shouts at a distance.) The guns on the heights even now proclaim their approach. Let us be gazers. [They retire. March. On one side enter Peganus, Valerio, Petronio, Ferdinand, Livia, Rosamond and Attendants, followed by several Spectators. On the other, Gualtier and Servants. Gual. Great Sir!âright noble dames! and you, fair prince!â My sovereign greets with the All hail! of welcome Your graces to his honor-gaining court, By me, unworthyâand commands me say, That at the portal he awaits your coming, With heart that is athirst, until it drink The salutation of your several loves. Peg. Our brother shows kind favor: so thirst weâ Even with a longing mated to his ownâ Until we greet his highness. Sir, we follow. [Exeunt all but the Two Gentlemen. Enter Lucio. 1st Gent. What, ho! my lord Lucio! make you a race with time? Luc. Sir, I haste to the court. If you would question, urge prolixity aside. 2nd Gent. To the court? my lord! Methought that you and his highness were at variance. Luc. Sir, he hath made amendsâhe hath made amends: I go by especial requisitionâWould you further? 1st Gent. My lord, we would know if report speaks truly, when she numbers the lady Bianca among his highness' guests. Luc. Sir; his highness is definitely scrupulous in the precise enjoinment of the matter of secrecy; my finger on my lipâand, farewell! [Exit. 2nd Gent. His ignorance is his secrecy. Come! Sirâ will you home? [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Anti-room in the Palace of Saluzzo. Enter several Courtiers: to them, another Courtier. 1st Cour. Well? You have seen Bologna's royalty? 2nd Cour. I have: and to note the manner of their reception by the Duke, was a very feast for eyes: methought the young princess Rosamond would have grown to his heart, so closely did he hold her there. She has withdrawn to the state tiring-roomâand (would sense believe it?) tended by the lady Bianca! 3rd Cour. Was ever humility like to this of Bianca? Its marvelâ 1st Cour. Hush! the sovereigns: away! let's to the festal chamber! [Exeunt Courtiers. Enter Duke, Peganus, Valerio and Livia. Duke. Welcome! most worthy brother: honour'd Livia! Our heart is now thrice rich. Valerio, Thou art a noble copy of thy sire In thy fair outward; be the inward so, And thou go'st nigh perfection, Sir. Peg. In him, You see a rock, to which our heart should cling, Were its best fortunes shipwreck'd. Duke. Gallant prince! Will't please you join the festive company? And, Sir, there is a lady i'the court Whose beauty we commendâand whose alliance Would rightly fit your greatness: you must woo her. Val. My lord, in thatâI speak in deferenceâ My choice must be my own: tho' eyes admire, It nothing follows that the heart should love. I go as you command. [Exit. Duke. He pays already Fond worship to the idol we set up For his idolatry: how soon this love Turns self-betrayer! Livia, you say You have instructed Rosamond in all These mysteries? Liv. She is in all made perfect: And first she stared in wonder; then she fell To weeping on my shoulderâsobb'd, and criedâ InstinctivelyâValerio!âwith which word, Did I turn conjuror, and in my mind, Unlink'd the thick-set chain of all her thoughtâ Taking it ring from ring. Duke. How receives she The tendance of Bianca? Liv. Tremblingly: As one who bears a heart o'erfull of feelings It may not utter. Duke. Prithee, haste! my Livia, And do as I have said: my gratitude Goes before service. Liv. Do not doubt observance. Peg. I will lead you. [Exeunt Peganus and Livia. Duke. My foot treads on the threshold of delight; And o'er me hangs a golden cloud of joy, Ready to burst in dews of ecstasy. What gentleness attends on all she does! Love and obedience do divide her beingâ No ill-tuned thoughts hold share: butâwill she keep Thus stedfast to the last?âmisgiving fool! My doubts would cling unto a spider-thread! WhyâAndrea is beloved for Andrea's sake, And so is Andrea happyâNo more doubts! Re-enter Peganus. Peg. Your Rosamond is dight: the presence-chamber O'erflows with company, and one and all Covet their sovereign's sight. Duke. But, more the feast: Right loyal hearts!âbut they must wait for that: There's that to act, which shall delay their revel An hour, or twain. Well! at your service, brother: The riddler goes to make his riddles clearâ Such brave solutions come not twice a year! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Presence-chamber in the palace of Saluzzo.âA banquet arranged on either side. Thrones, &amp;c. in order. âGuests discovered: among them, Valerio, Manso, Petronio and Lucio.âFlourish. Enter the Duke and Peganus, followed by Gaultier, Ferdinand and attendants. The Duke and Peganus ascend their thrones. Duke. A right good welcome! unto each and all, Who by their presence lend a grace to that Which else could boast no charmâour honor'd banquetâ Its honour, you. Petronio, we rejoice To see you with our kingdom's chosen, again; And thank you for past service, which, be sure! Is on the tablet of our memory, textâ Its comment, a premeditate reward, Equal to your deserving. Good old Manso! The presence of your honorable age, We deem a dignity; and much shall err, If happiness cast not upon your brow More sunshine ere you leave usâworthiest Sir! You are most welcome. Man. My dread sovereign! To your poor servant you show too much honor: Your words do make him object of all eyes, Which most he'd shun. Duke. You are our valued friend! Butâsee; the royal bride! Sweet music, ho! Music. Enter several attendant ladies, strewing flowers before Rosamond, who is led in by Bianca (in her country vest) and Livia. The guests rise. The Duke and Peganus descend from their thrones. Once more, dear welcome to fair Rosamond! Here on our throne we plant the prettiest flower That nature ever painted! [He places Rosamond on his throneâand Peganus Livia, on hisâleaving Bianca standing. Now, all knees Pay homage due unto Saluzzo's Duchess! [Flourish. The guests kneel and rise. Bianca continues standing. Will not Bianca kneel? Bian. My noble lord! I am the mistress of these ceremonies, By your allowance; and 'tis therefore just I do assume a ruler's privilege: But, so it please you, I will show submission Such as becomes a subject. Duke. NoâI say: Be mistress stillâand to our noble guests Speak a heart-welcome! Bian. Nobles of Saluzzo! Let not my mean apparel do you shame: Nor hold the feast less worthy, for that one So humble lent it order: if it please you, Your pleasure is my honor; and what value Lies in a welcome from Bianca's heart, Entirely yours. Duke. They thank you with their looks. And now, Bianca, please you to peruse That lady's face: what think you of our choice? Is she not fair?âHow say you?âIs she not A jewel in our crown?âPass sentence! Speak! Bian. Indeed, my lord, she doth become her state; And nor a juster form, nor fairer face Have I e'er gazed on: be her mind like perfectâ As sure it is (for honey needs must dwell Within the enfoldings of so rich a blossom) She shall, indeed, show worthy of her place, And to call Andrea, lord. Duke. You praise what is your own: For such in years, in feature, form and mind, Should our sweet daughter be. Bian. Alas!âshe's dead. Duke. She is not dead. Bian. I know she is not dead: She lives in heaven. Duke. Ay, when she dies, she shall! She is not dead;âfor thereâfor there, she sitsâ In life's most living beauty!âO, no more! Ladies and lords! you have misplaced your homage: We bade ye kneel unto Saluzzo's Duchess; But unto her ye knelt notâthis is she! Bianca, she!âMy true, my great Bianca! I have been slave to doubt; and of your love Made cold-heart trials: I the ruffianâI! That tore your child awayâthere's no divorceâ 'Twas a forged instrument we went upon! My village princess! royal villager! You are my bride, my wife, my queen, my soul, My heaven!âand were the Alps one diamond, I would not barter thee for all the gem! [He clasps Bianca in his arms, who gazes at him and Rosamond alternatelyâand faints. Ros. (taking her hand) Loved lady, wake! behold your daughter here, Beggar for blessing! and submissive vows Hear from her love-tuned lip! Ah, me! how cold.â Man. Great Sir! What have you done? A tide of joy Drowns my child's life: if so, and there it end, Old Manso's in his grave. Duke. Stand off!âlet the air fan Her senses back!âI'll kiss her into life! Bianca, wake! why, queen! why, lady!âlove! Awake to rapture!âSweet!âO, gracious heaven! If thou art dead, I am sole murderer Of all the world; and henceforth bear a brand More curst than Cain'sâSee! see!âshe lives! she wakes! All lips be mute! Bian. (recovering, and gazing on Rosamond) If this be dreaming, let The slumber last for ever; for such visions Have nought so blest in all reality. My child! my lord! O, I am now in heaven, Or if upon the earthâthen earth is heaven! Dear daughter! in your bosom thus, I shed A mother's love in tears. Duke. O, my vast soul Is as a sea of joy! Hereafter, shall the tale Of all my doubtsâhow my distrustful heart Gave to my state the entire attribute Of your great love; and how my jealousy Was my life's poison, till it wrought out proofs That I, who loved Bianca for herself, Was for myself belovedâall this, and more, Hereafter shall be matter for grave talkâ Or, if you will, for merriment. My lords! The cloud that hung upon your sovereign sun Is broken; and the doubts must now stand cleared With which you dogged our actions. For this maid, For our procedure we had other reasons: We knew our sister's skill in forming youth To her own honor's model, and preferred Our daughter to her government. Approves she not Our trust? Is she not well named Rosamond? O! is she not the rose of all the world? Bian. Unto Bologna's princess am I bound, As much a mother to my child in care, As I in nature. Liv. So my work hath prosper'd, My praise and my reward went with the doing. Duke. And now, what says Valerio to our counsel? This, Sir, 's the lady whom we spake about: Is she your choice? Peg. Come, Sirrah, be not dumb. Val. My Lord, had I to choose from out the world, It should be none but Rosamond. Duke. Take her, And wear her in your heart so tenderly, That, should she die, that bosom-fire,âremorse, May not companion you beside her grave. Come, my Bianca! to my heart again: You are now i'the bloom of life, and all our days Hereafter shall contend which most shall swell Our second date of joy. All you that love Your sovereign, your homage right direct: Health! and all hail! unto his peerless queen! All. (kneeling) Health to Bianca! hail! Bian. Arise, my Lords. O, could I coin my heart out in rich words, I'd stamp a million of pure golden thanks, And make them current with you. Enter Attendants. Attend. Please your highness, He whom you named 's arrived, and, as you bade, Our fellows stop his entrance. Duke. They do well. It is your brother, dearest,âmad Aurelio. [Whispers to Bianca aside. Bian. O! with delight, my Lord. Quick! Rosamond. [Exeunt Bianca and Rosamond. Duke. Go, Sirs, and bid Aurelio seek our presence. [Exeunt Attendants. What think you, Manso, of these freaks of ours? Will not Aurelio turn to very statue, With mute surprise, to see his sister shine Our Duchess still? Man. My gracious sovereign, 'Twill serve him as a lesson, not to judge Of men, or thingsâby semblance. Enter Aurelio. Duke. Welcome! Sir: You're a late guestâYet, welcome; and we hold Your presence as a feast.âSee! your Sire's eyes Make you their banquet. Aur. This is nought, my lord. Peg. Good Sir, There are accounts between us: you refused Our proffer'd serviceâwas it kindly done? Aur. A certain purse Sent by the hand of yonder messenger, (Pointing to Fer.) Your highness meansâOh, good my lord, your pardon! Alms are for beggars. Luc. As are they for alms. Duke. Voice full of music unto Andrea's ear! Oh, my lord Lucio, we are wondrous glad To see you here again; and, worthy Sir, Grow wise betimesâtake lessons from the hour: And, prithee, in the grave of better thoughts Bury sour jealousy. Think on't, my lord. Aur. (aside) Not here, amongst her equals! Can she be Match'd with his menials? Noâthat scarce may hold: My Sire's brow is too clear. Duke. Why roams Aurelio's eye so restlessly? What is the best you seek? Aur. What is the best? That which Duke Andrea's deeds to all the world Would proclaim worstâO, had we here a best Equal to such a worst! My lord, I crave My sister's presence: she whose greatness made My sum of bliss; whose downfall wiped all mirth Clean from my soulâfor what poor joys still linger Are nought but wrecks; dim shadows of dead substanceâ Mere grains left in the crucible of life, From whence the golden stream hath long been pour'd! Duke. The fair Bianca?âis't of her you speak? Sure she was here but now?âand will, no doubt, Be visible straightâBe patient! SirâMeanwhile, We'll glad your eyes with a strange-natured star, That lights the world by dayâour bride, we mean: It is impossible you are not fain To gaze upon her? Aur. As you will, my Lord. I have no mind to see this fair usurperâ Hold, heart! (Aside). Duke. Now, music!âfill the temple of the soul, Thro' the ear's gate! Music. The Duke goes out, and returns with Bianca, in her robes and crownâleading Rosamond. Behold! Behold! Aur. 'Tis she! 'tis she herself!âI do not dream! O! be this hour an immortality, And my life in it an eternal sprite, To live in bliss for ever!âor if 'tis Delusion, let me hug the shadow thus, And ne'er clasp substance more! (Catches Bianca in his arms. Bian. Beloved Aurelio! Delight is now a sovereign's sovereign, And bids her hold her peace. Aur. Pardon, great Duke, If even now my reason remain traitor And hold you still, unjust. Duke. The gold untried Is not so precious as the metal dipt Seven times i'the furnace: our Bianca's love Is now thrice dear: of this hereafter, brother And friend, Aurelio. Now leave gazing there, And look upon this maid:âis she not gentle? Is she not fair? Aur. Most like a royal lady! Duke. Ay! she is royalâfor Duke Andrea's blood Flows in her veins: look up, joy of our joys!â It is our daughter you do gaze upon! Aur. Daughter?âthe lovely Rosamond. Duke. My daughter!â Do you not note rich beauty's full descent? Is not her mother pictured on her face? There gazeâand read, âBiancaâ!âLo! the child Men said I murder'dâIâDuke Andrea, murder'd! I murder thee, thou dear one?âI had rather Have given my frame to racksâmy soul to fire!â I murder thee! Aur. Upon my knees, for pardon! My future service bid obliterate The unwilling wrong I've done my sovereign. Duke Arise! brave Sir. In this young prince, you see The royal bridegroom of this beauteous bride: Heaven make their lives all sunshine! dimm'd at most By rainbow showers. Aurelio, we shall place you In office of high trust. To your retirement, Manso, Since that you will be hermit, we shall oft Bring graceless mirth. And now, the banquet! lords: This marriage, after. From our history, Draw this: Unhonour'd birth and plain array Are oft the veils of beauty and of virtueâ Goodness is best gentilityâand worth Is ever worth, from whencesoe'er it springs, From humble cottage, or the seat of kings! [The curtain falls. THE END.</field>
