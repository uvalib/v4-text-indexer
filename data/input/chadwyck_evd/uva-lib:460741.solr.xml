      <field name="fulltext">THE APOSTATE; OR, ATLANTIS DESTROYED. A Tragedy. IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Yamos. King of Atlantis, converted to Christianity, and Founder of the City. Orooko. A Priest of the ancient religion of the Country, who has retired with a few followers into the woods. Arak. An Officer of the Palace, in love with Mora. Sebi. An Elder of the tribes who constitute the people of Atlantis, and father of Mora. Antonio. An European, saved from shipwreck by Yamos, whom he has converted to Christianity, and instructed in the arts and polity of Europe. Idda. The wife of Yamos, in love with Antonio. Mora. The daughter of Sebi, betrothed to Arak, but in love with Antonio. Elders of the tribes—Females attendant on Idda—Atlantines—Priests and Officers of the Palace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Forest with openings, which disclose vast mountains and cataracts at a distance. Arak. (alone.) How holy is this calm magnificence Of mountain, lake, and wood! The ceaseless blair Of the hoarse cataracts, by distance soften'd, Seems but the soothing lull of Nature's voice, Charming all thought into tranquillity.— Here I will stop till old Orooko come, Nor on the simple worshippers intrude, Who still with him refuse the Christian faith, And 'mid these scenes of solemn loneliness, With aimless rites and ineffectual prayer, Adore the fancied powers, our nation served, Till good Antonio from the ocean waves Was sent by Heaven, to teach the truth divine. Enter Orooko. Orooko. Who art thou, that within these hallow'd shades Presum'st in that apostate garb to enter? Arak. Do you not know me? Orooko. Arak! is it thee? Nay, no embrace,—Thou hast the Gods forsaken, And I their priest must never more again Receive thee to these arms, nor ever raise My hands above thee, to implore their blessing.— O ye unknown dread and beneficent! Whose genial power all artless creatures praise, Pardon these tears, forgive my weak old heart, That would forget this hapless young man's sin, And still receive him, as your gracious spirit Taught me to look upon all human kind.— Oh, then I knew not that such things could be As man presuming to select his God.— Yet, Arak, if in penitence you come, Come to my heart, and with most joyful tears I'll bathe thy forehead, and absolve thy sin. Arak. I bring a message from the king to you. Orooko. What would he now with me. Oh, he might spare The little remnant I have left of life, To the deserted worship of the Gods,— His country's Gods,—Those ever-bounteous powers, That blest his fathers from the first of time, Nor ever once upon our happy tribes Sent civil discord, till that fatal hour, When on our coast the curs'd Antonio came, Like something horrible cast from the sea, To mar, with his perplexing arts and faith, Our sacred rites and old simplicity. Arak. Alas, Orooko, you will not discern The good, the blessing in Antonio given. Orooko. Within the bowers of these far-spreading woods, We happy dwelt, and with the morning light Our song as cheerful as the grateful birds Rose to the powers that bless'd us—all the day The active chace gave energy to health, And when at night, our frugal meal dispatch'd, We stretch'd ourselves beneath the fragrant boughs, We fear'd no danger in the form of man, For we had nothing then that could be stolen. Spirit of Nature, did my tongue say nothing?— Yes, we had happiness, and that sweet ease— And the sea outcast has purloin'd them all. Arak. But he has given us better, and tenfold— Taught us to rear the safe and shelt'ring shed, The woes that wait on perjury and crimes, And the rich promise of a second life, A glorious morning to the night of death.— —But the king summons you. Orooko. What does he want? I cannot aid him in his new designs— My heart grows sad whene'er by chance afar My wand'ring eyes see, through the opening woods, His rising town; and sad presages come, Lest the dread Gods, whose secret throne of fires, Deep in the hollow of the mountain glows, Will burst the earth, and sweep in floods of flame Th'apostates and their perishable homes.— But what can Yamos now require of me? O he was once the sunshine of my soul, And never, never, did prolific Nature A being fashion in the human form So good, so kind, so modest, and so brave.— Methinks I could have pardon'd all the tribes, Had they rais'd altars to adore that youth, For then they had but worshipped in him Th'embodied excellence of all that lives. Alas! that goodness has but caus'd this ill, And but for it the fraudulent Antonio Had been thrown back into the hungry sea, When first he dared to slight our ancient rites— But grief bewilders me—I lose myself— Why does the king require me in Atlantis? Arak. The queen of late, drooping forgoes his love, And he desires that with your speediest skill You would restore to him her wonted kindness. Orooko. Though she too is apostate, I will go.— Lead on, I'll follow: never, but to take Some gentle essence of appeasing herbs, To quiet sorrow, or extinguish pain, Shall e'er my feet towards your city tend. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An apartment in the Palace of Yamos. Yamos and Antonio. Yamos. Thrice have the trees renew'd and shed their leaves, And the fourth fruit hangs blushing on the bough, Since thou, Antonio, child of Providence, Wast on our shore, snatch'd from the greedy waves To bless our wilds and world undivulg'd To thy far countrymen, who dwell beyond The rising sun. O ever since that hour, How rich in knowledge hast thou made us all! Teaching our docile youth the arts of peace; The all-cementing harmony of law, And like the new moon, out of darkness born, Still more and more, to the full round of light, Brightening our souls, though with the dim reflex Of that eternal truth, which in thy land Sheds the warm mid-day beam—In all this time, With constant wisdom ever blessing us, Thou hast thyself been still alone unblest. Antonio. Most gracious Yamos, in what I have done I feel my happiness a rich reward, And the proud honors which the good unborn Will pay my name, already I foretaste.— The time will come, when from the Eastern world, With spreading sail, some daring mariner Will this way steer, then all these unknown scenes Of inland seas and forests infinite Shall be reveal'd. Oft, sir, as I have told, Their winged vessels would the way explore, And that in which I 'scap'd the waves to you, Was sent in quest of this great continent, Of which some dark report had long prevail'd:— And when they come and find the arts of Europe In sweet communion with the Christian faith, My name shall rise to an equality With that of Cadmus or of Bacchus, those Who in the elder time brought westward truth. Yamos. But wherefore wilt thou not be one of us— Our nation shall to thy posterity Give higher honors than to all our kings. I pray thee, friend—or rather let me call thee Creative genius of our rising world, Consent to what we ask—the gentle Mora, The daughter of the venerable Sebi, Has long the influence of thy virtues felt— Felt as the rose-bud feels the solar beam, And to their brightness would unfold her breast.— You seem perplex'd, why should my words disturb you? Why do you sigh and look like one that heard Unhappy tidings—tell me why is this? Antonio. My heart is grateful to your Majesty, But in the rearing of your infant state I find abundant blessing—Did I yield To soft endearments, my ennobling aims Might sink abortive, and entail but woe. Yamos. Thou hast, Antonio, yet but given precept, Give us example too, that we may see By thy bright practice how to guide ourselves. The rights of fathers, husbands, sons, and men, Thou hast prescrib'd to us. Take now a wife, And by thy actions in the wedded state, Show us in what our customs need example. Antonio. There is a beauty, sir, in principles, Which those who most in theory revere, Cannot transfuse into their way of life. I have denied myself connubial love, Lest I should not in practice so conform To the great precepts I aspire to teach. Yamos. I will no farther press this matter, friend: I humbly own the grandeur of thy motive, I do thee homage for't; but while you thus Appear a doubting, conscious, erring man, Such virtue makes you glorious as a God. [Exit the king. Antonio. O noble being, how art thou deceiv'd; How black and horrible methinks I show Beside the lustre of thy purer nature! Thou dost sustain me, Yamos, in thy love, As the new moon in its first hoop of brightness, Holds in embrace the dark and rayless old. [Exit. SCENE III. Another Apartment. Yamos and Idda. Yamos. Alas, dear Idda, wherefore would'st thou shun me? The time was once that I was all to thee— The blossom breathing to the mid-day sun, Its bosom's fragrance, never was more faithful Than thy sweet love, the fragrance of the heart, Was wont to meet me; but how art thou chang'd! Ah me, how chang'd! looking askance upon me, As at some hateful reptile that you fear'd— And yet to thee I am entirely love. Idda. I know not, Yamos, why I should be thus,— I would be to thee what I was before, But some foul vapor hath beset my brain, And stain'd the wonted substance of my thoughts. Yamos. Since good Antonio has not yet been able To turn again thy far-reverted love Back to its proper course; but still the more This woeful change works to increas'd dislike, I have sent Arak to the old Orooko, To bring him with his genial simples here, That we may try their power. Idda. I'll none of them. Leave where he lives that petulant old man; What would he here, but fret, as he was wont, Against Antonio, and with searching eyes Make still more irksome my unquiet heart. Yamos. Does he too, Idda, grow displeasing to thee? Once that old man was to thee as a God; And God-like was his fault, for it was kindness. Idda. But is he not Antonio's enemy? Yamos. He has refused to take the Christian faith— But there's no enmity in his kind nature. I'd think as soon Antonio bad and false, As I could think Orooko would molest. Idda. But wherefore bring him here?—I need him not, And he may vex Antonio with his prying. Yamos. Unhappy Idda, to what strange conceits Thy thoughts and fancies turn. Why should he pry? Nor from the freedom of a good old man Can there be aught Antonio would conceal. But thou art ill at ease; fair Mora droops, And all our wonted medicines have fail'd. Alas, poor Mora! solitary—still With hopeless wishes must she ever pine. Antonio has rejected her. Idda. Rejected! Yamos. He will not marry; constant to the bent Of the great purpose that exalts his mind Above our nature, he will never join His fate to any woman's. Idda. Did you ask? Yamos. Even now I did. Idda. And wherefore did you that? Yamos. Can it offend you, Idda, that I sought To make him happy, who has blest my people? Idda. Had you no other motive? Yamos. Ah what other? Idda. But he rejected her, and will not marry? Yamos. Why should that lighten up your eyes with joy? When you might grieve to think ill-fated Mora Must hopeless sigh in unrequited love. Idda. Love! said you love! (aside.) Ah now I know the cause Of her averse and fearful diffidence. Yamos. My dearest Idda, my once gentle Idda, Why should this news such angry looks excite. Yes, Mora loves the excellent Antonio. Idda. O not to love him were almost a sin— But my fit comes—O Yamos, o'er my head Methinks some hideous and unholy thing Hath perch'd itself, and feeds upon my brain— I would I were not what I am, or could Again the fondness of thy love return. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Portico. Yamos, Orooko, &amp;c. Yamos. Welcome, Orooko, give me yet thy hand; Come, be not sad, but make our meeting joyous. You were to me a loving father once, And I am still to you a faithful son. Orooko. I feel towards you as I always felt, But here are sights afflicting to my eyes, Turning the pleasure of this hour to woe. Yamos. To me, to all, your re-appearance here, Is cheerful as the sunbeams after night. Orooko. And night it has been, Yamos, since we parted; A night of dreams, whose phantoms still deceive, O let me hope that thou wilt 'waken from them. Yamos. And yet these gorgeous objects rising round, The tow'ring city, and these royal ensigns Of arts and polity, should teach my friend, All is not fantasy.—The sleep was yours. Like the sun-loving bird that sleeps in winter, And wak'ning in the spring, finds Nature new; Cover'd with blossoms and resounding songs, You come among us wond'ring at the change. Orooko. The arts, the ornaments which you admire, Are as the speckles and the glittering eye Of the fell snake, and these increasing sounds, The stir of labor in your guilty town, But as the rattle that announces death. Yamos. Is there then nothing that can please your eye In all this new magnificence? Orooko. No, nothing. Yamos. Would you we should resign the social arts— The various pleasures industry makes ours, And sink into barbarity again. Orooko. I wish you only to cast off the vices, Which with these gaudy garments you put on. The virtues need no robes, they ever move In healthy vigor, naked like your sires. But these gay trappings of civilization Are but the covers of offensive sores.— As I came sadly to this spacious dwelling, Two stately edifices met my view;— One was too great, too lofty as I thought For any use of man; the other seem'd Too closely strong, even for the fiercest beasts. What are they, sir? Yamos. One is a temple hallow'd, Open and free for our religious rites. Orooko. What! does the God, the stranger has reveal'd, Live like a creature local and limited. Yamos. The God we worship is the God of Nature, The spirit of the ocean and the earth! Orooko. Then wherefore have you built to him a house, When the whole universe is full of him? In light and blossoms, and melodious sounds, We know his beauty; in the fruits and sleep, And in the gladness of the blameless breast, We feel his bounty and enjoy his care; The skies so vast and inaccessible, With their infinitude of stars attest To us his greatness; in the strength of hills, The deep foundations of the steadfast earth And the long fetching of his breath in tempests, We own his mighty power; and when we question Why we do live and all this world should be, We recognise his undiscover'd Nature. Is it to Him that you have built a house? Yamos. You will but see our works in your own way; We have not rear'd the church for his abode, But as a place in which we may remember That he exists, and should be there adored. Orooko. Does then your knowledge, your civilization, Tend to make you forget him? Royal Yamos, Our fathers never dreaded such a chance. They heard him in the roaring of the waves; They trembled at his anger in the thunder; They fear'd the flapping of his wings in storms; They hail'd his smiling in the dawn of morn; They felt his kindness in the warmth of day, And like tired children in their mother's lap, They trusted to him in the nightly sleep. O he was every-where and they were with him. But for what purpose is your other fabric? Yamos. It is a prison, an appointed lodge, For such as wrongful injure one another. Orooko. Stop, Yamos, stop. O swift retrace your steps, To that simplicity that once was yours. Already lo, your new-found arts require Inventions to remind you of the God. Already they have taught you to prepare Abodes for men, men worse than savage beasts; If in a few short moons all these are needful, Think what shall rise when future ages come. If there are men that must be shut in dungeons, The bad in time may overtop the good, And make them to their wicked purposes Offer themselves in hideous sacrifice. Yamos. I will no longer now debate with you. Come in and see the Queen, and if you can, Restore her errant love again to me. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An apartment. Arak and Mora. Arak. Why will you, Mora, ever thus avoid me, Why ever thus averted turn your eyes? O look upon me; let me see again, That gracious loveliness which won my heart, But still, O still, must I in vain address you, Your cold and alter'd looks in vain deplore? Mora. Leave me, good Arak, leave me to myself, I would I were deserving of thy love. Arak. Alas, what frenzies now are rife among us! Yamos bewails his consort's faded love, And must I, Mora, also mourn for thine? Mora. It had been better, had we never known These gay and festal arts Antonio teaches, Than thus to feel all ties of truth relax'd. Surely from them this sad perversion springs! Arak. O say not so, believe not so, dear maid; Say rather he has taught us to cast off Our savage nature, and with purer thoughts So temper'd and refin'd our base desires That we are rais'd into a nobler state. Alas, perchance the passion of my heart, Is but some dross of my barbarity, Not yet remov'd. Ah it appears to thee So gross and foul, that thou hast turn'd away, Tir'd of my fondness, and with royal Idda Delighted shar'st his ever-varying wisdom. Mora. O spare me, Arak, spare me, noble youth! Arak. Ha! why is this? O wherefore do you weep? Mora. Most true it is that I have been too oft A happy listener to Antonio's voice. Arak. And mine no more is pleasant to your ear. Mora. But grieve not, Arak. I am innocent. Arak. Innocent! could you have e'er been guilty? Guilty! of what! you are not yet my wife, And if your heart be chang'd, though I must mourn, Alas, must languish without hope of cure, Why should the change be link'd to thoughts of guilt? No, Mora, no. I long have fear'd this truth: Antonio's virtues, like the solar beams Which by their brightness quench the dim dull hearth, Have all thy former love for me extinguish'd. But gentle maid, to me for ever dear, I will no more molest thee with my suit. But speedily with all my earnest thoughts Devise the means to make thee blest with him. Mora. O Arak, Arak, you know not the man. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Another apartment. Orooko, Yamos, and Idda. Orooko. Why do you chide your lord, why is his love Thus bitterly repell'd? Yamos. 'Tis her disease; Be not, Orooko, wroth with her, but try Some kind appeasing med'cine to allay This fretful ecstasy of peevish thought. Idda. I am not ill, old man, trouble me not. I want no med'cines, but the cooling charm Of your desir'd absence. Give it me? Orooko. I do not think you ill of malady, But some infection taints the conscious mind. What fatal wrong have you done to your lord, That you look on him with such eyes of hate, While love and tenderness so melts in him? Yamos. All things, Orooko, seem to thee revers'd. Orooko. Tis meet I should converse with her alone. Yamos. Bear with him, Idda, let him have his way, He is a man full of most bounteous feeling, And comes obedient—not to my command, But to the gentle spirit of himself To cure your bosom's pain. I beg, Orooko, That you will mercifully hear her chidings, Think what she once was to me, loving kind; O this dire change but serves to make her dearer. Yes, the remembrance of our former love Stands in bright contrast to the void of loss, Making the beauteous and delightful past, Compar'd with the unhappy vacant present, Like the sad lesson of a rosy child That smiling gambols round a yawning grave. Be kindly in your speech—and if her thoughts Be touch'd with aught that hath perplex'd their course, In pitying care the remedy apply. [Exit Yamos. Idda. Well, Sir, what would you? Orooko. How! so soon at ease? Then you do fear the King as well as hate him? What is the wrong that you have done to him? That you should dread his sight, and in his presence Be weak and trembling, looking with such eyes Upon that goodly and most gracious man, As if he were some creature venomous? What is the cause? Idda. Came you not here to find it? Orooko. Such maladies as yours were never known, When all were true to their forefathers' virtues, Therefore the cause—Ay, lady, mark my words, The cause must come from this new state of things. Why do you look at me in such amaze? Then it is true, and your apostasy Has changed the frame and temper of your heart. O ere more horror falls in curses on you, Abjure the subtile stranger's unblest rites; And on the mountain's top, that altar rais'd, By all-seen Nature to the all-felt God, Lift thy pale hands and deprecate thy doom. What! do you smile, and scornfully at this— The mind has then no part in your disease— You mock my piety, and when I bid You turn repentant from the stranger's Gods, You do not hear me as a proselyte, But with the heartless and contemptuous scorn Of one that reverenc'd not any God. Idda. I wonder much that you, so wise reputed, Should waste your ineffectual breath on me. Orooko. [aside] They have built dungeons for those that do ill— This woman must be one that has done ill, For she no longer hath that modesty With which our faithful mothers heard reproof. Your royal husband called me from the woods, With herbs and simples to relieve your ail; But the disease is far beyond the search Of all the inquisition of my skill, And I may sorrowing to the woods return. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A garden. Arak and Antonio. Arak. That the fair Mora loves you tenderly, And has for you forgone her love to me, I doubt no more, nor can I blame the change, When I contrast my naked ignorance, With that rich-crown'd, that flowing vestured knowledge, Which makes you ever to my wond'ring eyes, Appear the sovereign wisdom of all times. But while my tongue thus says, what I should say, My heart, alas, still in its savage grossness, Yearns at the sacrifice and speaks in tears. Ant. No: generous Arak, thy true heart is right, And 'tis thy judgment that mistakes in this. I am not worthy of fair Mora's love; Reclaim her yet, re-win her for thyself, Would she were worthy thee, and I like thee, Could merit her by so resigning her. Arak. O hapless Mora, fated like thy lover, To feel the anguish of rejected passion!— Have you no charm that you can give to me, To lure her truant heart to its first love! Or some endearing cordial for yourself, To make you see her with fond eyes like mine? But see, Orooko comes. If he can turn The Queen's affection to her lord again, Perchance his skill may Mora's too reclaim. Ant. [aside] O Heavens, what horror am I doom'd to suffer? [Arak during this soliloquy has advanced towards Orooko.] How the pure fancies of this guileless race Make the foul odium of my guilt appear! They look on me as on the orb of day; O little think they that the light they worship Gleams but from dead and guilty rottenness, Compar'd to which they are themselves Heaven's stars. [Enter Orooko, and Arak returns.] Orooko. Unhappy Arak! I will speak to him. Ant. [to Orooko.] Have you been able to relieve the Queen? Orooko. [to Ant.] You only can do that,—why do you start? The ill that taints her bosom came by you— And you should, Sir, in bringing such disease, Have brought with it the needful antidote. Are such distempers common in your country? Ant. I fear they are. Orooko. The gentle Mora too, Arak's betroth'd, has caught the same infection; Sir, you seem greatly mov'd. I mean no harm, I only grieve that with the arts you teach, Such fearful and appalling reprobation, Should thus destroy the ties of faithful love. Arak. But Mora is not, like her royal Mistress, Afraid and angry when I speak to her. She owns her love and treats me as a brother. Orooko. She owns her love! what love? Arak. Love for Antonio! Ant. (aside) Ha! he has caught the truth! Arak. What means all this? Orooko. Leave us, dear Arak—leave us for a while. [Exit Arak. Stay, Sir, you must remain, a word, a word. The giant bark that brought you to our coast Seem'd as it welter'd on the surfy shore, Some monstrous thing presaging woe to us. From all the haunts of all our woody land, Successive came our wand'ring tribes, to see The awful sight. And with compassion mov'd Our youthful monarch, Yamos, took thy hand And plac'd thee by himself, an honor'd guest. At that dire hour your dreadful work began. You taught us arts—divided us in bands, These for the chace, and those to seed the soil, And when your tongue had learnt our simple speech, You spoke of life and worlds beyond the stars, And call'd our ancient rites of gratitude, To the great Spirit—aimless superstition. Ant. In doing so, I know that I did well. Orooko. The proof of that must show in the effect. But I proceed—Dissensions rose among us— Your altars prosper'd, while with hapless me A few undaunted faithful chose the woods. Here, here enchanted by your seeming wisdom, Thousands on thousands swarm'd to raise the town, And it was rais'd. For this eternal temple, High in whose measureless concave the sun A lamp of everlasting splendor shines, You have th'Apostates from their father's God, Led to a mansion built by their own hands, And made them kneel before such feeble emblems, As the soft-breathing of a bird, might quench; And you have dungeons rear'd. Ant. O let me fly— Orooko. Fly! whither. No.—You shall hear all your works, Now answer me.—The gentle Mora loves you,— For you her heart has turn'd from gen'rous Arak, And yet she sees him with nor hate, nor fear— Thy pallid visage tells me all I ask.— Go to thy temples, prisons, knowledge, arts, And find some means to purge our tainted tribes, From these new sins that thou hast brought with them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A vestibule. Orooko, Sebi, and Arak. Orooko. Go, summon without preface or delay, The honor'd elders of the tribes to meet. Sebi. They hold the magistracy of the town. Orooko. No matter, go. Tell them I would impart Things of most high concernment to us all. They were not wont in the old better time, To wait for dues of ceremonious state. [Exit Sebi. Who is with Yamos? who is with the King? Arak. He is alone. Orooko. What you here, Arak! Arak? Arak. Ah me, Sir, what has chanced? (aside) He is perplex'd, His thoughts coil inward, and his eyes are fierce, As the fell snake's when it infolds itself To spring upon its victim. Orooko. Where is the stranger? Arak. Antonio? Orooko. Where has he fled? Arak. How fled? I saw him scarce a hundred breathings since, Enter the portal of the Queen's apartment. [Exit Orooko. Surely some hideous madness touches all, For thoughts, and fears impossible, appal me, And when I told him where Antonio was, He shriek'd as if he had a serpent trod. Exit. SCENE II. An apartment and Couch.—music without. Yamos and Attendants. Yamos. Bid the musicians cease. Let them forbear. The soft melodious sadness of their song Awakens in me but unhappy thoughts.— Methinks the ghosts of all my ancestors, Hover around me, and in piteous silence, Look on my grieved and melancholy mind. O sure some dreadful woe unseen impends That thus my heart feels cold as kneaded clay. Send for Antonio to me. I Attend. He is here. [Enter Antonio.] Yamos. Art thou too sad, my friend, pray thee draw near, Sit here by me, I would converse awhile, To learn why thus my anxious spirit pines, And questions oft the use of all our labors? Ant. Such weary thoughts, sir, frequently arise, When the exhausted spirit needs repose. They are the dreams of reason, and molest, Like the night visions, only while they last. Yamos. And shall I wake from this unhappiness; Shall my lov'd Idda chearfully awake? And take me back with those endearing arms With which she press'd me to her virgin breast? Alas, you sigh—there is no hope of that. [Enter Orooko.] How now, Orooko, why these looks of rage; What new discov'ry in the town alarms? Orooko. Stranger, avaunt. Yamos. What change is this, Antonio? Orooko. He shall not stay, let him at once retire! Yamos. Treason, Guards, ho! Dost thou menace, old man? What hast thou done, that thou dar'st thus insult Our royal presence with this fierce demeanour. Antonio, fear him not. I will protect thee. Though mutiny and rash rebellion rise, By his incitement. I am still thy friend. You weep and tremble—weeps Orooko too? Friends, why is this? Orooko. Let him retire. Retire. [Exit Ant. Yamos. Now he is gone, what would you say to me? Orooko. The thunder's voice heard in the summer's calm, Nor the great Spirit's when he heaves the woods, In wilder billows than the roaring ocean, Speaks no such horror, as I must unfold. Yamos. Orooko, tell me, is my Idda dead? Orooko. Curses descend on her. Let fury come, And wide and numberless as all the leaves, That the winds scatter when the forests fade, Disperse the ashes of her guilty form. Yamos. Thou art not mad, Orooko? yet thou speak'st More frantic ecstasy than the loose wrack, Of scatter'd thought, in the disorder'd mind Hath ever yet assum'd. Orooko. The Queen is false. Yamos. False, False? Repeat what thou hast said—the word. My ears ring fearfully—repeat the word.— Orooko. False with Antonio, Yamos. Hoary liar, ha! (strikes him down.) Orooko. (on the ground.) Gods of his fathers, take my thanks for this. Now must the noble soul of Yamos feel, By this dishonor he has done himself In striking me, his own, his father's friend! What shame and woe springs from Antonio's guile. Yamos. Th'infection works, in every joint I feel The withering horror seizing on my strength. It was delirium! and I heard it not. No one did say to me my wife was false— Antonio! O to what wicked thoughts The idle fancy will betake itself! While the musicians sang, I closed my eyes, Strange fears oppress'd me. I would see Antonio,— He came and he was sad. Orooko came— Is that Orooko on the ground before me? Orooko. (rising.) Distraction kindles in him, help, O help!— Yamos. Hush, hush, we will be calm, we will be calm. (They sit down.) Come, sit thee down—we will discourse of this— And first I will relate my dream to thee— Antonio—no, he is not.—O my heart, It swells to thrice three hearts, and stops my breath. Once I did think he fondly look'd at her, And she responded with familiar smiles, Such as no wife may blamelessly express.— And when I chid her for't, that hate began, Which no imploring love of mine could alter, No tend'rest grief since that dire hour appease. Orooko. Did you observe their love? Yamos. What love? what love? I but beheld a free unseemly glance. What have you seen? Orooko. Alas, dear noble Yamos, Such looks unchaste were never known before. Yamos. Ha! is it for that, you have so tortur'd me. And for your worship and availless rites Would tempt me thus to sacrifice my friend. Away, old man—back to thy wilds again; Provoke me not with guilty imputation, To think as ill of thy respected self, As thy fell bigotry would say of others. What is this knowledge, that with painful throes My mind would bring into the world of thought, And on it, as a mother o'er her child, All other things forsaking, fondly doat— Suspicion! Suspicion! O forerunning shadow Of coming woe—more hideous than the substance. If this Antonio be the wretch you think; If Idda be the victim of his guile; What may ensue?—Nothing more ill than is! And the good springing from Antonio's knowledge Must still be good, let him be what he may. Orooko. How know you that? Yamos. I will endure no more; If thus I listen to thy venomous tongue, I shall believe the glorious sun himself Black as eclipse—Away, away, and leave me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Another Apartment. Idda and Mora. Idda. Find me Antonio; bring him to me here: For old Orooko thinks what he should not, And we must turn the current of his thoughts.— Why do you stand? Go, bring Antonio to me. Mora. Forbear, I pray you—While Orooko's here, Seek not that fatal man. O royal Idda, Ere yet too late, if it be not too late, Snatch your affections from this headlong stream; It draws you swiftly to a deep perdition! Idda. I am not, Mora, to be told, your eyes Betray the wishes of your throbbing heart Towards Antonio. Pray thee, gentle maid, Give me not reason to suspect thy truth, By the great virtue which thy tongue affects. Mora. O I am conscious of my erring nature, My mind contemning what my heart desires; But surely, surely, it becomes not you To blame a fault that I have still restrain'd! Idda. Obey my orders. Mora. Freely in all else. Idda. Do you refuse me then?—Ha! Arak here! [Enter Arak.] Why come you here, sir, with such looks of terror? Arak. Where is Antonio? Idda. How! He is not here. Arak. Orooko, by his old prerogatives, Convenes the magistrates, and they assemble: I would Antonio were prepared for this; Such convocation bodes to him no good. Mora. Ah, royal Idda, do not doubt my faith. Arak. Is not Antonio here? Idda. What should he here? Arak. That were not fitting for me to inquire; But if I saw him, and might speak to him, Perhaps I could such signs of trouble tell, That he might shun the danger they forewarn— Stern thoughts have gain'd the solemn mastery Of old Orooko's wonted gentleness. Idda. Go, seek Antonio then—Go, Mora, too: Here I shall languish for your swift return. [Exeunt Arak and Mora. My heart shrinks in me, and I tremble all, Like one that has pernicious berries ate, And 'gins to feel the ill juice in her blood, Clotting the pulses of the vital stream. [Enter Antonio.] Ant. But for the woman's sympathetic lewdness Stirring the vice in me that I had quell'd, I might have left, in this new world, a name To match the brightest of antiquity. Idda. Antonio! Ant. Ha! what would'st thou? Idda. Softly; hear me— Ant. No more, no more. Idda. Do you Orooko dread? Ant. We have together drank a fatal draught, And now the poison burns straight on to death. Idda. Hear me, Antonio— Ant. Horror and Death Have seiz'd upon me, and in folds of flame The one envelopes my distracted soul, While the cold other with his icy fang Grasps me immoveably. Idda. Will you not answer? Ant. Well, what would you? Idda. Do you dread Orooko? Ant. I dread myself—O rather let me say I have done that which I cannot undo, And by the guilt made awful forfeiture Of the high destiny that once was mine. This having done, and from all honor driven, I know not what extremity of guilt My out-cast doom may draw me yet to do. Idda. Hush, hush; this fierce impassion'd rage repress— Into my chamber, where we shall be safe. Ant. To hell at once!—O I already suffer The torments of damnation in the thought Of what I was, of what I might have been. Idda. We whirl in jeopardy; the tide of fate May sweep us from the chance within our reach, If we delay to catch. Ant. Then let us sink, And time close over us as smooth and trackless As the deep ocean o'er the bottom's sand. Idda. O it is true what our old warriors say; The lofty mansion and the stately couch Unnerve the body and impair the mind. Thou hast not manhood in thee to endure The test which our heroic youth were wont To rise refulgent from—Adversity! The worst that can ensue to both of us, What is it but to die? Ant. The death of life, The dagger, or the stake, appal not me. Idda. What then dismays you? Ant. Fame and honor lost. Idda. Were they not lost till old Orooko came? Has his suspicion, which makes us unsafe, Chang'd too the quality of our fond love? Before this day you never own'd alarm; But now when he menaces to destroy, Behold, the memory of fame and honor Comes like a ghost to frighten your repose. Ant. Yes, yes, from sleep—I am indeed awake! Idda. And being so, up and appear the man, And show your brightening forehead to the storm. The coward creatures are the prey of man; And he who fears like them belies his form. But we are open to intrusion here; Into this chamber—Nay, but you shall come. [Exeunt into an apartment that opens in the centre of the scene. [Enter Yamos.] Yamos. I will not credit what Orooko thinks: His mind has ever been adverse to all Antonio's mighty purposes. Old age, That makes experience wisdom, grows to folly, And the good man may have outliv'd discretion.— It is not, cannot be, that one so great, So lofty and prospective in his virtue, Should fall to such perdition. But my Idda! O Heaven and Nature! if 'tis not disease That hath the sweet love of her bosom chang'd— Ah, who art thou, so ghastly and so grim, With grasped dagger, and blanch'd quiv'ring lip, That beckons me towards horror?—Revenge! Hence from my soul, delirious suggestion. Murder Antonio! What hideous guilt Must in the issue of such treach'ry lie, That my unhappy spirit should devise Indemnity so terrible?—No, no: They are not guilty, and my mind is cleft From all propriety in thinking them. O righteous Heaven! with some oblivious blessing, Quench in my memory Orooko's venom, And heal my heart to confidence again.— (He goes to the door by which Antonio and Idda had retired, and on opening it starts back: Antonio and Idda come from within and fly off at one side, while Orooko and attendants enter from the other: after a pause Yamos comes forward in a state of stupefaction.) Orooko. O hapless Yamos, what unhallow'd vision Enchants thine eyes to look that way so wild?— Speak to me, Yamos, tell me what thou see'st?— Yamos. Nothing—they are not there—they were not there— I saw them not—I thought but what did seem— (to Orooko.) Art thou not, wretch, some false bewildering devil, Mocking my sight with good Orooko's form? O thou hast bred with thy soul-tainting breath Thoughts of such horrible and hungry crave, That I must needs be wicked—It is true! A sword, a sword!—Now well I know the cause Why he enticed us to unbelt our swords: He fear'd that in detection we might use them, And so made passage for a safe escape. Orooko. Speak you, sir, of the stranger? Yamos. Of the fiend! He came to me so piteous and forlorn, That my weak heart could not but do him kindness. He seem'd to me so wond'rous and so wise, That my poor thoughts could not but do him homage. O little thought I when religiously He used to tell me of the luring wiles With which the foe of God seduces man, That he was him, and then betraying me. Orooko. Still you are free, though Idda be his victim. Yamos. O Idda, Idda! Rose of my delight! The odious worm voluptuous with thy beauty, Has turn'd my love to loathing—Damn her, damn her! Orooko. Does other proof than my suspicion move you? Yamos. O yes. Orooko. What!—who? Yamos. My eyes! Orooko. How, Yamos! where! Yamos. Earth, make me part of thy insensate mass; Let me be kneaded by the heel to clay, (throws himself down.) Rather than bear the memory of that vision! Orooko. O thou renewing spirit of the air, Whose genial power informs the sleeping spring When to put forth her young hands to the ray, Revive to hope the withering soul of Yamos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment. Antonio. (solo.) The sin was Nature's when she made me thus:— These limbs she moulded; link'd the vital chain Of lively pulses circling through my heart; Gave that love-darting lustre to my eyes Which the fond fair so willingly obey; And tun'd my voice to that persuasive mood, Which wins so easily whate'er I ask:— Can I then doubt the promptings of desire, Come not as issue and effect from Nature, And if they do so, wherein lies the ill? I cannot choose, when beauty meets my sight, But instantly to feel its thrilling charm Enticing to embrace. Good is but pleasure, And that which pleases must be good to me; If others find it harm, is the fault mine? [Enter Arak.] Arak, my friend, approach—Why stand you back? Why look you on me with such awful dread? What would you with me? Why these alter'd looks? Arak. The consecrated elders of our tribes, Convened by old Orooko, send for you. I am their messenger; say, will you come? Ant. But tell me first, why thus you are so sad— My sin is but an error of my blood, Call'd into action by the queen's alluring. Arak. The consecrated elders of our tribes, Convened by old Orooko, send for you. I am their messenger; say, will you come? Ant. Well, I will go: but Arak, do inform me— [Exit Arak. My friend! ha, gone! without a word, retir'd!— Save but his solemn summons twice repeated. O vain delusion! to persuade myself That the delinquency of mine offence Belong'd to Nature, or that others would Ascribe my guilt to the primeval sin. It is not what a man thinks of himself That constitutes him bad or virtuous, But as his actions touch the hearts of others.— Yes, that same bounteous and divine endowment Which fills the bosom with alert aversion Against all odious and injurious things, Excites the hate that guilty deeds inspire.— The loathsome scorpion, whose envenom'd fang Strikes cruel death, nor the remorseless vulture, That plucks the eyeball of the hero dead; O not the yellow and abhorred worm, That riots on the breast where youthful love, Once hop'd for bliss, is to the sense so hateful, As I am now to the affrighten'd thoughts Of this confiding, good, and gentle race. [Exit. SCENE II. A Vestibule. Yamos and Orooko. Orooko. It cannot be that this deceitful man Derives his blood from our primeval sire: He nor his nation, nor the God he worships, Can have affinity with us or ours. We, till his fatal tread deform'd our shore, Did ever deem that chief most worthy honor, Who least appear'd to need another's aid. He would have taught you but for this blest crime, I call it blest, since it dissolves the spell Of his deceit—yes, had persuaded you That they deserve the ritual of the knee, Who are themselves of all mankind most helpless. Before the round of many moons had wan'd, We should have seen the ties reciprocal, Of chief and follower slacken'd from all use, And man to man in opposition set Upon the plea of rank inherited. Has he not told that in the eastern world, The man most honor'd is the slave that tends The largest count of slaves? Were not his arts To quench the instinct which the mighty spirit Bestow'd to guide us, giving the conceits Of human frailty and invented reason Hostile supremacy o'er nature's wisdom?— Were such the customs, such the precepts ever Of your great sires who never own'd a slave, But conscious lords of all the breathing world, Held each with each th'equality of kings. Their only vassals were the prey that paid A prompt obedience to the speedy shafts Which levied their revenue—You attend not? Yamos. Be you, Orooko, judge, I am not fit: The vengeful influence of his treachery Distorts to me the rightful aim of justice. Orooko. No, Yamos, no; this solemn cause demands That you should prove to the audacious stranger Our old inborn superiority. It must not seem that our selected chief Should e'er in his great office stand perplex'd— What! shall we hold the frail and feeble wretch Who shrinks at the affliction of a wound, Rejected of our tribes, and not require From you, our chief, that firm impartial mind Which would adjudicate against itself? Yamos. Against itself!—You know me well, Orooko, Nor have I swerv'd from my integrity; But I do feel my spirit apt with ire, To be vindictive by the sword of justice. Orooko. How! is thy nature then indeed so tainted, That all its hate of the exotic crime Is turn'd on him who had thy own permission? Yamos. Much I can bear, Orooko, from thy chiding, But chafe me not too far—my rage is hungry, And will have prey before it is appeas'd. Orooko. Do you refuse the duty we expect? Yamos. How now, old man, you frown rebelliously? Orooko. What if I, in the name of all the tribes, Assert the privilege the elders ever Have held in times of public jeopardy? Yamos. And what was that? Orooko. To change the ruling chief. Yamos. What have I done to cause me such dishonor? Orooko. You do refuse to execute your trust. Yamos. I would refuse it in this, my own cause, But I do not refuse. Orooko. Then follow me To where the assembled elders of the tribes Have form'd the circle of avenging justice, And wait but for your coming—This way, sir. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An Apartment. Idda. O what is this that weighs upon my heart Like the oppression of a dead man's hand— Methinks all nature is alarm'd around, Rous'd by the omens of some dreadful change, Whose coming horror far and black descried No mortal can describe. I seem to stand Like one deserted on the frozen sea, While o'er the waves, beyond the stretching ice, Dark as mid night, a brooding tempest glooms— O'er head, the sea-birds screaming seek the land— The bold seal-hunters hurrying without prey, Look wildly wond'ring at the fated wretch, And sullenly speed home—Loud under foot, Th'imprison'd ocean raging to be free, Tears with the earthquake's strength.—What is my doom? [Enter Mora.] What will they do with me—what is decreed? Mora. There is a rock, two bow-shots from the shore, Whose tangled head, till half the tide is run, Lies hid beneath the waves. Idda. Well, Mora, well. Mora. What time to-night the evening star shall rise Above the mountains, that mysterious rock Will from his forehead lift the watry veil. Idda. O Mora, be not so oracular, But tell me quickly all. What horror waits On the appearing of that dismal sign? Mora. I can but only echo what I heard. Idda. Proceed, proceed, there's boding in thy voice; And the sad portent of these solemn eyes, Alarms me more than were the sun eclips'd, And the bright stars that gem the winter's night, Seen through the myst'ry of the summer's noon.— When the black forehead of the rock appears, What hideous work begins? Mora. In silence then, Two sable boats shall slowly quit the shore— Idda. Bearing me and Antonio? No? What then? Mora. In one shall sit the dumb dejected man, Who knows all things that other mortals know, But wants the organs to embody speech— And he shall bear in his right hand— Idda. O heavens! Mora. A funeral torch, to kindle on the rock The signal fire of death. Idda. The other boat? Mora. Shall follow freighted with a sentenc'd victim. Idda. Which? Mora. You. Idda. Alone? Mora. Alone. Idda. Tell me what then? Mora. The boats will leave you on the rock to perish, With no companion but the deadman's fire, By which, when the refluent tide has quench'd it, Th'assembled tribes, collected on the shore, May know your life was with the flame extinguish'd. Idda. My throat is parching and my breath becomes Like suffocating ashes—air! air! air! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Wood: the town seen beyond. The Elders of the tribes assembled in a semi-circle on the ground. Orooko, Yamos, Antonio, &amp;c. Orooko. This warmth is counterfeit, notions so fanciful, Spring not in Nature from th'impassion'd heart— They are but fire-flies, startled from their resting, And not the inborn blossoms of the bough— Answer expressly to the charge we make? Antonio. How may I to your stern demand reply? I own the guilt! I ask the punishment! If aught the tortures of your fiercest fires Can add of anguish to the thoughts I suffer. But Oh, forbear to blame the truth I taught, Nor think the sin of my ill-destin'd frame Can taint the bright intelligence of Heaven, To which I am but as some hateful reptile, Whose slimy back reflects the glorious sun. O royal Yamos, noblest injured man, I seek no mercy for my odious self, Though thy blest nature, form'd for higher good Than the heroic spirit e'er inspir'd, Would e'en to me, whose devil-serving passions Have made such wreck of all thy soul held dearest, Find naught so easy as to grant me pardon, Let not the thought, that my detested crime Is ever sequence to the taste of truth, Enter the temple of thy blameless heart; But onward bravely in thy great career, And be to all succeeding ages known, As he who first amidst the Atlantine wilds, The altars of eternal knowledge raised. Yamos. But what will that avail? Antonio. (aside) Ha! does he doubt? Yamos. Turn not away, I speak not to reproach— Unhappy man, I ask thee but to tell How will the praises of the far-unborn Repay the sacrifice that must be made, Before the fruitage ripen into use? O yes, Antonio, once I thought like thee, That to be class'd with those immortal kings, Whom all the sages of thy eastern world Deem wisdom best devoted in revering, Were a triumphant recompense for braving My fathers' ghosts, whose unembodied voices Spoke sternly to my thoughts. Alas, when oft Amidst the falling trees we fell'd to raise Yon guilty roofs, I heard them sigh around, My fearful heart had foretaste of its woe, And felt, it knew not why, th'alarm of guilt; But still the flatt'ring pageant of renown Rose bright in view, and my enchanted mind Beheld as 'twere an image of myself, High rais'd refulgent, while in spreading circles Appear'd the millions of succeeding times, Filling the vast horizon to its bound, And shouting loud my name. The dream is past! And yet methinks I am not well awake. The hideous nightmare sits upon my breast, And while I see around these towers and domes, I strangely hope my sense is but abus'd By some delusion of unwholesome sleep. Idda, my love! art thou not at my side? Where art thou, Idda?—O where is my love! Orooko. Yamos, Yamos, what madness fires thy mind, That thus in the great synod of the Elders Thou darest this breach of all solemnity? Yamos. See'st thou that pallid wretch, whose evil eyes Have glanc'd eternal blight on all my hopes? Orooko. Come to thy seat again, and give the sentence. Yamos. But will the word of power, that dooms to death, Restore my bosom to its wonted calm? Orooko. This wildness must not further be endured.— Never before did warrior of our tribe Insult the presence of th'assembled Elders, With such a rapture of entranced passion. Yamos. Never before were any of our tribe Pain'd with the anguish of a grief like mine. Orooko. (to the Elders) Ye, who have felt in youth's imperious prime, The goading insult of a foeman's frown, Rouse your bold spirits into leaping rage, That would not be restrain'd; blame not in him These transports at irreparable wrong, But pardon his irreverence—take your place— Come, noble Yamos, look, the Elders wait. Yamos. What would they more?—Antonio has confess'd, And Idda ye have doom'd—O why should I Be further tortured in this dire probation? Orooko. Say but the sentence, and it will be finish'd. Yamos. Then let him live. Orooko. How live? Yamos. Aye, and may Heaven Punish his crimes with constancy of health, Prolong'd beyond the utmost term that love, E'er in the hour of rapture wish'd to live. For he is noble, and the sense of guilt, With keener agony than tonguing flames Lick to the bone, will be his punishment. Orooko. Shall he live also free? Yamos. Yes, free and public.— Beware that none of the accustom'd homage Towards him be withheld—else might the thought, The angry thought that springs from punishment, Defeat th'intended horror of our sentence.— Antonio, friend! why dost thou hang thy head, And clasp thy hands distracted in the air? Once thou didst tell me of some secret law, By which the evil germ in different breasts, Holds mystic sympathy, and to ill deeds E'en passing strangers suddenly constrains— This truth of all you taught, I find first true, The devilish charm of your perfidious guilt Stirs in the latent vices of my blood, And makes me cunning that I may be cruel. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Street open to the sea, the rock seen. Antonio. Shall I thus solitary ever live, And in these haunts, scenes of my pride and triumph, Alone like one of those dejected ghosts, Whom poets in their mournful frenzies deem The hov'ring witnesses of joyous rites, Held by the friends they thought would weep their death, Move unregarded, or be seen with fear?— It were a state less hideous to be doom'd To constant penance in some dread cadav'ry, Where the dim death-light shows the mould'ring dead, Grinning as 'twere in horrible derision, As the contemptuous spirit of decay Throws from its scite the long unfasten'd scull.— To sit alone in some forgotten ruin, Far in some distant long untravell'd waste, Where, save the thirsty serpent's ceaseless hiss, No sound is ever heard:—To see from thence The red and arid sun's unvaried orb, Roll o'er the brazen skies and sink to night, Day after day, in dull monotony, And all the story of remembrance lost, But one black thought, the memory of my crime, Would not, methinks, be such a solitude, As that which now environs me around, In the denying looks of former friends.— Here comes my enemy—O thought unjust; He was no foe, had I myself been true. [Enter Orooko.] Orooko. There stands the wretch so woeful and forlorn, That my relenting nature melts to see him. Antonio. I would speak to him, and enquire the doom Pronounced upon the queen. He will not answer, And yet there's more compassion in his eyes Than e'er I witness'd, more than they express'd When hapless Yamos sav'd me from the sea. [The sound of a shell or horn is heard.] Orooko. Hark! the sad sounding of the funeral shell, Gives dismal warning that the hour approaches. Antonio. Tell me, Orooko, what these sounds denote? Orooko. The prelude of a solemn sacrifice.— Thou start'st!— Antonio. A sacrifice! Orooko. Yes, to our Gods! The Gods of nature and of innocence! Antonio. Ah, stern old man, dost thou impute to mine, The instigations that have made me guilty; Or think'st thou that my better part denies The justice of the punishment I suffer.— Now, that no more my faith may taint thy tribes, Nor thin the worshippers around thy altars, Wilt thou, for once, allow me to repeat The grounds of my religion. Orooko. Fatal man! Dost thou presume with me to try thine arts?— Spirit of everlasting life and light, Avert their influence, and keep me firm, Against this new contrition that begins To mine into my heart! (to Antonio) What would'st thou say, Would'st thou rehearse to me that tale of fancy, Which thou hast told of worlds beyond the stars, Where vital brightness in the beams of wisdom, Still kindles with intelligence eterne; And bid me break the bread and drink the wine, As my acceptance of admission there? Or would'st thou frighten me, if I refuse, By the grim terrors of that other region, That dread abyss beneath the midway ocean,— Beneath the deep foundations of the isles,— That hollow vast of everlasting fires— Sapping the arch on which great Nature stands, Predoom'd to fall with hideous crash, and hurl Into the billowy and exasperate flames, There sink for ever and for ever down,— Would'st thou tell this, and ask me to believe? Ant. No, Sir, and yet by your impassion'd voice, You seem to tremble, lest it may be true.— But I would tell you how th'eternal mind Abhors the guilt of its corporeal agent, And ask you whence such strange division springs, If that which thinks, and that which acts in man, May not exist apart? Orooko. And if they may? Ant. Shall then the thoughtful element be left In unappropriated listlessness, When into dust its mortal dwelling falls? Or should we deem all the recoil of action Fix'd to the limit of our biding here; And lift the aims of human thought no higher Than the mean instincts of our sensual wishes?— If man be as you say but animal, Why am I punish'd, where was Idda's crime? [Sounds of the shell. These dismal sounds of sacrifice again! And this way rolls the throng! Orooko. O stay not here, Stay not to witness what must here be done. Alas, Antonio, thy mysterious thoughts Perplex my spirit in an awful hour. [Exeunt. [Enter Sebi and Mora.] Mora. Where shall I fly that I may but forget The hideous look of horror and despair, With which she glared on me her last farewell. O father, father, hold my bursting head, Her glance was lightning, and has fired my brain. Sebi. Unhappy child! Mora. Do you not hear her cries? Hark! Sebi. All is silent. [the shells sound. Mora. Ha! the shells again, She struggles still, they drag her to the shore. O bear me hence, support me, father, hence— I dare not that way look, and yet my eyes, Charm'd by her horror, will not be withdrawn. Sebi. Why will you linger, asking still to fly, Come, dearest Mora, come? Mora. They hold her fast, The dumb torchbearer steps into the boat; They bind the victim—wretches, hold! hold! hold! [Exeunt towards the side by which they entered. SCENE II. An Apartment. Yamos and Arak, and Attendants. Yamos. Heard ye that shriek? It came upon my ear As the quick lightning flashes on the eye, Startling the soul—How awful is this silence Which has succeeded to that glance of sound! Methinks it has affinity with death, And should be named with epithets of blackness. Where is Orooko? Arak. At the sacrifice. Yamos. What sacrifice! Why dost thou turn away— It was the victim's cry then that I heard?— O 'twas my Idda, loveliest, still belov'd!— But I forget that justice claim'd her doom, And Guilt with clammy and opprobrious clutch, More hideous than the mouldering grasp of death, Tore our incorporated hearts asunder. [the shells sound. Hark! again, O Idda! down my heart, lie down. Summon the choristers, bid them sing shrill,— Wake all your instruments of wildest sound, And drown th'afflicting discord of her cries.— [Music] No more, no more—Tell me, is it yet done? Has the bright star, that should to night arise At the returning of the tide, appear'd? Arak. It just begins to glimmer o'er the sea. Yamos. O ere the tide shall reach its wonted bourn, The beauteous orb, that crown'd my life's fair dawn, Must set for ever in the gloomy wave.— Has not Orooko come? Arak. We have not sent. Yamos. Why am I not obey'd, wherefore is this, That you deny the duty of your place? Go bring him instantly—yet stop—not yet.— She may not yet have reach'd the fatal rock. How long time thinkest thou?— Arak. What would you, sir? Yamos. No matter, Arak—we'll towards the shore,— Command Antonio to attend me there. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Rock and fire—The coast and town seen in perspective, the boats pass. Idda. O they are gone, and will return no more, And I am left to perish here alone! Stay yet awhile—stay but to see me die! Suspend your oars till the returning wave Has quench'd my life and this dull flame together. Alas! alas! they heed not my entreaty! But swift and steadily make to the shore!— The shore is throng'd, piled with a countless crowd; Hear me, O hear me!—O my feeble voice Fails in the midway of the dismal distance, And I am here an off'ring on death's altar, Like some lost wretch by eager heirs interr'd, Awak'ning from his trance within the grave— O horror, horror, is there then no hope! [Exit. SCENE IV. A Street. Orooko, Sebi, and Antonio. Orooko. What would the crowd with all these pitched brands? Sebi. They think that when the waves o'erwhelm the queen, Yamos will then restore our ancient rites, And bid the town be fir'd. Orooko. Who told them that? Sebi. Tis but their fancy. Orooko. And yet they prepare, As if th'ordonnance of it were proclaim'd! Such strong assurance in the public mind, Denotes some feeling in the frame of things, That proves the pregnant future almost ripe With some great offspring in the line of fate. 'Tis as the sadness that pervades the air, Before the coming thunder. In the town Far-stretching necks from the close-crowded windows, And all eyes turned the same way in the streets, Do not more certainly presage th'approach Of solemn pageants, than parentless rumors, Foretell th'occurrence of some high event. Sebi. You seem alarm'd—I thought you would rejoice. Orooko. Hast thou heard this, Antonio? Sebi. He's entranc'd, And hears not what is said. Orooko. Antonio? Ant. Well! Orooko. See'st thou the throng so busily intent— Look how the young men cleave the splint'ring pine, While in the seething pitch their fathers dip, The riven fragments which the children gather, And serious women in their aprons bring. What think'st thou of this solemn preparation? Ant. O righteous Heaven! now is my doom complete, Must that blest germ which I had planted here, For my aggression be so soon destroy'd. Orooko. Who told thee that? Ant. You to the truths I taught, Ascribe the guilty working of my blood, And to suppress the truth will burn the town. Orooko. Antonio! Ant. Speak, what mean you! Orooko. I believe, If that which thinks in us survives the tomb, That thou wast right in teaching us to rise Still more and more out of the sensual life, Into th'intelligence which after death May raise our being to a higher state. (Ant. kneels.) Sebi. What sudden blessing dissipates his gloom, And makes him thus in thankful transports kneel. [Enter Arak.] Arak. Unhappy Yamos, wand'ring in his mind, And with the crowd wild-mingling on the shore, Commands you to attend. Orooko. Antonio rise. Alas, I would thou might'st remain behind. For at the sight of thee his rage again May burst in outrage fatal to the wish, Which my expanding heart begins to cherish. Ant. Come let us go. Whatever may befall Cannot be evil, if on you descends Th'inspiring mantle of immortal truth. Yes! o'er the funeral ashes of the town, A pure celestial light shall ever shine, To which the scatter'd tribes will oft return, In holy pilgrimage, if you will guide Their wand'ring spirits in the devious way Of knowledge, which, alas, so slipp'ry winds Through tangling brakes, where many a serpent lurks. [Exeunt. SCENE V. The Shore. The rock seen at a distance, nearly covered, the star high in the Heavens, and the water rising.—The crowd of the town on all sides.— Yamos with his back towards the rock. Enter Orooko, Antonio, Arak, and Sebi. Yamos. Approach, Antonio, come—thou wast my friend, I did believe thou wast, for I was thine, And lov'd thee well, yes, I was kind to thee, And lov'd thee for the kindness I bestow'd, More than the misers of thy distant world Doat on the coffers where they lay their treasures. How hast thou answer'd my confiding friendship? But come, draw near, why dost thou shrink apart? The ill which thou hast done will soon be ended. Behold this throng, whose every eye is turned Towards a part of the dark rising sea, Where I can never look—What see'st thou there? Well may'st thou tremble—Tell me what thou see'st. Ant. A dim red flame. Yamos. And nothing more?—no sign? Ant. Yes, ever and anon it is eclipsed, As if some busy figure intervened. Yamos. Idda is there alone—Nay, do not sink: Thou hast a part in this terrific rite, And I expect the full and dread performance— Attend and answer me—What now appears? Ant. O take my life, and save me from this torment. Yamos. Be mute in all, but to my questioning— Burns yet the light? Ant. It does. Yamos. See'st thou no sign? Ant. The billows rolling on the rising tide, By fits obscure its dim and lurid glare. Yamos. Does it still burn?—Slave, slave, perform thy task. What means that deep and universal sigh? Ant. The light is quench'd.— Yamos. My Idda is no more! And the suppress'd affliction of my soul May now take all its frenzy. Orooko. Hold his hand! (Antonio stabs himself and falls.) Yamos. Ha! which of you did this? Orooko. Himself. Yamos. Himself! Orooko. With his own guilty hand he aim'd the knife. Yamos. Stop! touch him not! lest the self-murder'd corpse Cause some contagion worse than this new crime. Now, now, Orooko, loud, with all thy voice, Command the sacrifice. Orooko. What sacrifice? Yamos. A victim meet for our apostacy; Lead on the multitude and fire the town! Orooko. Stay, Yamos, stay; suspend thy rash design; For if the crime of this self-slain arose From causes adverse to his truth and science, What deeper guilt had stain'd his short career, But for their blest restraining—Heavenly truth, Like the bright sun's unquenchable effulgence, Which, from the foul and aguey fen, exhales The foggy pestilence and dries its poison; Receives no blemish from terrestrial vapor; Serene, sublime, it holds its destin'd course Above the momentary clouds that shadow The human Chrysalis, whose mortal term, By the slight tissue, spun from its own breast Is pass'd in darkness and captivity. Yamos. (to Orooko.) Ha! is the demon that in him deluded Transferr'd to thee, who wast of all the world The most oppos'd to his great mysteries?— Then spread thy wings, and speed into the sun-shine! (He stabs Orooko who falls.) Come now, Atlantines, hurl your brands around, Till but the ashes of the sacrifice Be all the trace of our apostacy.— Ghosts of our sires, pause in your airy chase, And, as the flames of these proud towers ascend, Around in hov'ring circles, view them burn. [Curtain falls as the town is set on fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS ON THE APOSTATE. The story on which this drama is founded, was probably suggested by that obscure rumor which had prevailed from the days of Plato, to those of Columbus, respecting the existence of the western continent. It is, however, a subject, perhaps, more suitable to descriptive narration, than calculated to produce such a degree of dramatic effect as would render it impressive in representation. The motives of the author in making choice of a fable so entirely fictitious, seem to have been of a two-fold nature; the originality of the incidents which it allowed him to introduce, and the opportunity which it afforded to him of placing the two great crimes, peculiar to the civilized state, Adultery and Suicide, in a strong and striking light. Several of the ocular circumstances, though questionable as his inventions, will readily be admitted to equal in the terrific any thing which the stage exhibits. The situation of Idda left to perish on the rock, is one of this description, but it is perhaps not thoroughly dramatic; for when she compares herself to a person untimely interred reviving within the grave, she only gives us another view of her own horror without adding any new feature to the frightfulness of the original idea, or eliciting any thought which might enable us to participate in her feelings. The expiring of the penal fire seen by the spectators, is founded on a real occurrence mentioned in the life of Admiral Byron; and the imagination cannot conceive any spectacle more awfully interesting. Had it been an invention, the author might have obtained the praise of contriving one of the most sublime scenic spectacles in the whole range of the drama. The characters, like the incidents, are perhaps rather possible existences than delineations of human beings. In Orooko, however, there are traits of individuality, which make it probable that it was in some degree intended for a portrait. Antonio, as a development of constitutional licentiousness counteracting moral intentions, may lay claim to some consideration. He is of a species familiar enough to the stage, but of a class that authors have been diffident in embodying so fully. Yamos is only a young Othello, and Arak is not sufficiently prominent to interest us much in his fate. The character of Idda, is not graced with any amiable feeling. It may be doubted if the author has acted judiciously in making so naked a delineation of the debasing effects of the animal propensity; for the fastidious spirit of modern criticism is offended if the snaky length of Sin be not concealed by a petticoat. The train of moral sentiment in this piece is evidently derived from Rousseau's celebrated essay against the arts and sciences; and the reader of voyages and travels will probably discover an indirect endeavour of the author to give a fabulous account of the origin of that inexplicable antipathy which the Indians of America cherish towards the effects of civilization. He informs us that the ideas which he has given to Orooko, were principally drawn from an authentic description which he had received of the manners and notions of the Indians, from a person who once spent a hunting season with a party that was in the practice of making an annual visit to the city of Philadelphia. In this respect, the piece possesses a degree of originality, wholly independent of the poet, and of a kind which deserves attention without reference either to the verse or the language. The reader alone can determine whether the subject of this play has been so managed as to interest the mind; for whatever may be the claims of originality, as to invention or appropriation of incidents, the tragedy can have but little merit as a drama, if the story is not interestingly developed. We are requested to state, that the outline of Antonio's character was suggested by the manner in which Mr. Kean performs the character of Iago—It certainly has appeared to many good dramatic judges, that the air of libertine gaiety which that excellent actor assumes in this part, does not accord with the general impression which the text of Shakespeare makes in perusal. Perhaps the objection made to Mr. Kean's performance is well founded. The versatility of his talents requires a various part to produce their full effect, and the Iago is so uniformly a villain, that the defect of Mr. Kean may be owing to an attempt to vary the odious sameness of the character. Iago is one of the strongest drawn, but the worst completed of all Shakespeare's characters. It is equally unnaturally wicked and consistent. The attempt of Mr. Kean to make it more human, is a proof of his good taste; and his failure in this part is rather an honor to his judgment, than a disgrace to his powers.</field>
