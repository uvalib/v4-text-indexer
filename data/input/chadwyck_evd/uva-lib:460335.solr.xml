      <field name="fulltext">âMajor rerum mihi nascitur Ordo; Majus Opus moveo. Virg: Ãneid: 7.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His ROYAL HIGHNESS The DUKE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr. Dryden's Play, The Conquest of GRANADA. Th'applause I gave among the foolish Croud, Was not distinguish'd, though I clap'd aloud: Or, if it had, my judgment had been hid: I clap'd for Company as others did: Thence may be told the fortune of your Play, Its goodness must be try'd another way: Let's judge it then, and, if we've any skill, Commend what's good, though we commend it ill: There will be Praise enough: yet not so much, As if the world had never any such: Ben Johnson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Shakespear, are As well as you, to have a Poets share. You who write after, have besides, this Curse, You must write better, or, you else write worse: To equal only what was writ before, Seems stoln or borrow'd from the former store: Though blind as Homer all the Antients be, 'Tis on their shoulders like the Lame we see. Then, not to flatter th'Age, nor flatter you, (Praises though less, are greater when they'r true) You'r equal to the best, outdone by you; Who had outdone themselves, had they liv'd now. Vaughan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE to the First Part. Spoken by Mris. Ellen Guyn in a broad-brim'd hat, and wast belt. This jeast was first of t'other houses making, And, five times try'd, has never fail'd of taking. For 'twere ashame a Poet shoud be kill'd Under the shelter of so broad a shield. This is that hat whose very sight did win yee To laugh and clap, as though the Devil were in yee. As then, for Nokes, so now, I hope, you'l be So dull, to laugh, once more, for love of me. I'll write a Play, sayes one, for I have got A broad-brim'd hat, and wast belt tow'rds a Plot. Sayes t'other, I have one more large than that: Thus they out-write each other with a hat. The brims still grew with every Play they writ; And grew so large, they cover'd all the wit. Hat was the Play: 'twas language, wit and tale: Like them that find, Meat, drink, and cloth, in Ale. What dulness do these Mungrill-wits confess When all their hope is acting of a dress! Thus two, the best Comedians of the Age Must be worn out, with being blocks o'th'Stage. Like a young Girl, who better things has known, Beneath their Poets Impotence they groan. See now, what Charity it was to save! They thought you lik'd, what onely you forgave: And brought you more dull sence. âdull sence, much worse Than brisk, gay Non-sence; and the heavyer Curse. They bring old Ir'n, and glass upon the Stage, To barter with the Indians of our Age. Still they write on; and like great Authors show: But 'tis as Rowlers in wet gardens grow; Heavy with dirt, and gath'ring as they goe. May none who have so little understood To like such trash, presume to praise what's good! And may those drudges of the Stage, whose fate Is, damn'd dull farce more dully to translate, Fall under that excise the State thinks fit To set on all French wares, whose worst, is wit. French farce worn out at home, is sent abroad; And, patch'd up here, is made our English mode. Hence forth, let Poets, 'ere allow'd to write, Be search'd, like Duellists, before they fight, For wheel-broad hats, dull humour, all that chaffe, Which makes you mourn, and makes the Vulgar laugh. For these, in Playes, are as unlawful Arms, As, in a Combat, Coats of Mayle, and Charms.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Almanzor and Almahide, Or, The CONQUEST OF Granada. The First Part. Boabdelin, Abenamar, Abdelmelech, Guards. Boab. Thus, in the Triumphs of soft Peace I reign; And, from my Walls, defy the Powr's of Spain: With pomp and Sports my Love I celebrate, While they keep distance; &amp; attend my State. [To Aben. Parent to her whose eyes my Soul inthrall; Whom I, in hope, already Father call; Abenamar, thy Youth these sports has known, Of which thy age is now Spectator grown: Judge-like thou sitst, to praise, or to arraign The flying skirmish of the darted Cane: But, when fierce Bulls run loose upon the Place, And our bold Moors their Loves with danger grace, Then, heat new bends thy slacken'd Nerves again, And a short youth runs warm through every Vein. Aben. I must confess th'Encounters of this day Warm'd me indeed, but quite another way: Not with the fire of Youth; but gen'rous rage To see the glories of my Youthful age So far outdone. Abdel. Castile could never boast, in all its pride, A pomp so splendid; when the lists set wide, Gave room to the fierce Bulls, which wildly ran In Sierra Ronda, 'ere the War began: Who, with high Nostrils, Snuffing up the Wind, Now stood, the Champions of the Salvage kind. Just opposite, within the circled place, Ten of our bold Abencerrages race (Each brandishing his Bull-spear in his hand,) Did their proud Ginnets gracefully command. On their steel'd heads their demy-Lances wore Small pennons, which their Ladies colours bore. Before this Troop did Warlike Ozmyn goe; Each Lady as he rode, saluting low; At the chief stands, with reverence more profound, His well-taught Courser, kneeling, touch'd the ground; Thence rais'd, he sidelong bore his Rider on, Still facing, till he out of sight was gone. Boab. You praise him like a friend, and I confess His brave deportment merited no less. Abdelm. Nine Bulls were launch'd by his victorious arm, Whose wary Ginnet, shunning still the harm, Seem'd to attend the shock; and then leap'd wide: Mean while, his dext'rous Rider, when he spy'd The beast just stooping; 'twixt the neck and head His Lance, with never erring fury, sped. Aben. My Son did well; and so did Hamet too; Yet did no more then we were wont to do; But what the stranger did, was more then man: Abdel. He finish'd all those Triumphs we began. One Bull, with curld black head beyond the rest, And dew-laps hanging from his brawny chest, With nodding front awhile did daring stand, And with his jetty hoof spurn'd back the sand: Then, leaping forth, he bellow'd out aloud: Th'amaz'd assistants back each other crow'd, While, Monach-like he rang'd the listed field: Some toss'd, some goar'd, some, trampling down, he kill'd. Th'ignobler Moors, from far, his rage provoke, VVith woods of darts, which from his sides he shooke. Mean time, your valiant Son who had before Gain'd fame, rode round to every Mirador, Beneath each Ladies stand, a stop he made; And, bowing, took th'applauses, which they paid. Just in that point of time, the brave unknown, Approach'd the Lists. Boab. I mark'd him, when alone (Observ'd by all, himself observing none) He enter'd first; and with a graceful pride His fiery Arab, dextrously did guide: Who, while his Rider every stand survay'd, Sprung loose, and flew, into an Escapade: Not moving forward, yet, with every bound, Pressing, and seeming still to quit his ground. What after pass'dâ Was far from the Ventana where I sate, [To Abdel. But you were near; and can the truth relate. Abdel. Thus, while he stood, the Bull who saw this foe, His easier Conquests proudly did forego: And, making at him, with a furious bound, From his bent forehead aim'd a double wound. A rising Murmure, ran through all the field, And every Ladies bloodâwith fear was chill'd. Some schriek'd, while others, with more helpful care, Cry'd out aloud, beware, brave youth, beware! At this he turn'd, and, as the Bull drew near, Shun'd, and receiv'd him on his pointed Spear. The Lance broke short: the beast then bellow'd lowd, And his strong neck to a new onset bow'd. Th'undaunted youthâ Then drew; and from his Saddle bending low, Just where the neck did to the shoulders grow, With his full force discharg'd a deadly blow. Not heads of Poppies, (when they reap the grain) Fall with more ease before the lab'ring Swayn, Then fell this head:â It fell so quick, it did even death prevent: And made imperfect bellowings as it went. Then all the Trumpets Victory did sound: And yet their clangors in our shouts were drown'd. [A confus'd noise within. Boab. Th'Alarm-bell rings from our Alhambra walls, And, from the Streets, sound Drums, and Ataballes. [Within, a Bell, Drumms &amp; Trumpets. How now! from whence proceed these new alarms? [To them a Messenger. Mess. The two fierce factions are again in arms: And, changing into blood the dayes delight, The Zegrys with the Abencerrages fight, On each side their Allies and Friends appear; The MaÃ§as here, the Alabezes there: The Gazuls with the Bencerrages joyn, And, with the Zegrys, all great Gomels line. Boab. Draw up behind the Vivarambla place; Double my guards, these factions I will face; And try if all the fury they can bring Be proof against the presence of their King: Exit Boabdelin. The Factions appear; At the head of the Abencerrages, Ozmyn; at the head of the Zegrys, Zulema, Hamet, Gomel, and Selin: Abenamat and Abdelmelech joyned with the Abencerrages. Zulema. The faint Abencerrages quit their ground: Press 'em; put home your thrusts to every wound. Abdelmelech. Zegry, on manly force our Line relyes; Thine, poorly takes th'advantage of surprize. Unarm'd, and much outnumber'd we retreat You gain no fame, when basely you defeat: If thou art brave, seek nobler Victory; Save Moorish blood; and, while our bands stand by, Let two to two an equal combat try. Hamet. 'Tis not for fear the Combat we refuse; But we our gain'd advantage will not loose. Zul. In combating, but two of you will fall; And we resolve we will dispatch you all. Ozmyn. Wee'l double yet th'exchange before we dye; And each of ours two lives of yours shall buy. Almanzor enter's betwixt them, as they stand ready to engage. Almanz. I cannot stay to ask which cause is best; But this is so to me because opprest. [Goes to the Abencerrages. To them Boabdelin and his Guards going betwixt them. Boab. On your Allegiance, I command you stay; Who passes here, through me must make his way. My life's the Isthmos; through this narrow line You first must cut, before those Sea's can joyn. What fury, Zegrys, has possest your minds, What rage the brave Abencerrages blinds? If, of your Courage you new proofs wou'd show, Without much travel you may find a foe. Those foes are neither so remote nor few, That you shou'd need each other to pursue. Lean times, and foreign Warrs should minds unite, When poor, men mutter, but they seldome fight. O holy Alha, that I live to see Thy Granadins assist their Enemy. You fight the Christians battels; every life You lavish thus, in this intestine strife, Does from our weak foundations, take one prop Which helpt to hold our sinking Country up. Ozmyn. 'Tis fit our private Enmity should cease; Though injur'd first, yet I will first seek peace. Zulem. No, Murd'rer, no; I never will be won To peace with him whose hand has slain my Son. Ozmyn. Our Prophets curseâ On me, and all th'Abencerrages light If unprovok'd I with your Son did fight. Abdelmel. A band of Zegry's ran within the Place, Match'd with a Troop of thirty of our race. Your Son and Ozmyn the first squadrons led, Which, ten by ten, like Parthyans, charg'd and fled. The Ground was strow'd with Canes, where we did meet, Which crackled underneath our Coursers feet. When Tarifa, (I saw him ride apart) Chang'd his blunt Cane for a steel pointed Dart, And meeting Ozmyn next, Who wanted time for Treason to provide, He, basely, threw it at him, undefy'd: [Ozmyn showing his arm. Witness this bloodâwhich, when by Treason sought, That follow'd, Sir, which to my self I ought. Zulema. His hate to thee was grounded on a grudge Which all our generous Zegrys just did judge; Thy villain blood thou openly didst place Above the purple of our Kingly race. Boabd. From equal Stems their blood both houses draw, They from Marocco, you from Cordova. Hamet. Their mungril race is mixt with Christian breed, Hence 'tis that they those Dogs in prisons feed. Abdel. Our holy Prophet wills, that Charity Shoud, ev'n to birds and beasts extended be: None knows what fate is for himself design'd; The thought of humane Chance should make us kind. Gomel. We waste that time we to revenge shou'd give: Fall on; let no Abencerrago live. [Advancing before the rest of his Party. Almanzor , advancing on the other side; and describing a line with his sword. Upon thy life pass not this middle space; Sure Death stands guarding the forbidden place. Gomel. To dare that death, I will approach yet nigher. Thus, wer't thou compass'd in with circling fire. [They fight. Boab. Disarm 'em both; if they resist you, kill. Almanzor, in the midst of the Guards kills Gomel, and then is disarmed. Almanz. Now, you have but the Leavings of my will. Boab. Kill him; this insolent Unknown shall fall, And be the Victime to attone you all. Ozmyn. If he must die, not one of us will live, That life he gave for us, for him we give. Boab. It was a Traytors voice that spoke those words; So are you all, who do not sheath your swords. Zulema. Outrage unpunish'd when a Prince is by, Forfeits to scorn the rights of Majesty: No Subject his Protection can expect Who, what he ows himself, does first neglect. Abenamar. This stranger, Sir is he, Who lately in the Vivarambla place Did, with so loud applause, your Triumphs grace. Boab. The word which I have giv'n, Ile not revoke; If he be brave he's ready for the stroke. Almanz. No man has more contempt than I, of breath; But whence hast thou the right to give me death? Obey'd as Soveraign by thy Subjects be, But know, that I alone am King of me. I am as free as Nature first made man 'Ere the base Laws of Servitude began When wild in woods the noble Savage ran. Boab. Since, then, no pow'r above your own you know, Mankind shou'd use you like a common foe, You shou'd be hunted like a Beast of Prey; By your own law, I take your life away. Almanz. My laws are made but only for my sake, No King against himself a Law can make. If thou pretendst to be a Prince like me, Blame not an Act which should thy Pattern be. I saw th'opprest, and thought it did belong To a King's office to redress the wrong: I brought that Succour which thou oughtst to bring, And so, in Nature, am thy Subjects King. Boab. I do not want your Councel to direct, Or aid to help me punish or protect. Almanz. Thou wantst 'em both, or better thou wouldst know Then to let Factions in thy Kingdom grow. Divided int'rests while thou thinkst to sway, Draw like two brooks thy middle stream away. For though they band, and jar, yet both combine To make their greatness by the fall of thine. Thus, like a buckler, thou art held in sight, While they, behind thee, with each other fight. Boab. Away; and execute him instantly. [To his Guards. Almanz. Stand off; I have not leisure yet to dye. To them Abdalla hastily. Abdella. Hold, Sir, for Heav'n sake hold. Defer this noble Strangers punishment, Or your rash orders you will soon repent. Boab. Brother, you know not yet his insolence. Abdal. Upon yourself you punish his offence: If we treat gallant Strangers in this sort, Mankind will shun th'inhospitable Court. And who, henceforth, to our defence will come, If death must be the brave Almanzors doom? From Africa I drew him to your ayd; And for his succour have his life betray'd. Boab. Is this th'Almanzor whom at Fez you knew, When first their swords the Xeriff Brothers drew? Abdalla. This, Sir, is he who for the Elder fought, And to the juster cause the Conquest brought: Till the proud Santo, seated in the Throne, Disdain'd the service he had done, to own: Then, to the vanquish'd part, his fate he led; The vanquish'd triumph'd, and the Victor fled; Vast is his Courage; boundless is his mind, Rough as a storm, and humorous as wind; Honour's the onely Idol of his Eyes: The charms of Beauty like a pest he flies: And, rais'd by Valour, from a birth unknwn, Acknowledges no pow'r above his own. Boabdelin coming to Almanzor. Impute your danger to our ignorance; The bravest men are subject most to chance: Granada much does to your kindness owe: But Towns, expecting Sieges, cannot show More honour, then t'invite you to a foe. Almanzor. I do not doubt but I have been too blame: But, to pursue the end for which I came, Unite your Subjects first; then let us goe, And poure their common rage upon the foe. Boab. to the Factions. Lay down your Arms; and let me beg you cease Your Enmities. Zulema. We will not hear of peace, Till we by force have first reveng'd our slain: Abdel. The Action we have done we will maintain: Selin. Then let the King depart, and we will try Our cause by armes: Zul. For us and Victory. Boab. A King intreats you. Almanz. What Subjects will precarious Kings regard: A Begger speaks too softly to be heard: Lay down your Armes; 'tis I command you now. Do itâor by our Prophets soul I vow, My hands shall right your King on him I seize. Now, let me see whose look but disobeys. Omnes. Long live King Mahomet Boabdelin: Alman. No more; bu husht'd as midnight silence go: He will not have your Acclamations now, Hence you unthinking Crowdâ The common people go off on both parties. Empire, thou poor and despicable thing, When such as these unmake, or make a King! Abdalla. How much of vertue lies in one great Soul [embracing him. Whose single force can multitudes controll! A trumpet within. Enter a Messenger. Messen. The Duke of Arcos, Sir,â Does with a trumpet from the Foe appear. Boab. Attend him, he shall have his Audience here. Enter the Duke of Arcos. Arcos. The Monarchs of Castile and Arragon Have sent me to you, to demand this Town: To which their just, and rightful claim is known. Boab. Tell Ferdinand my right to it appears By long possession of eight hundred years. When first my Ancestors from Affrique sail'd, In Rodriques death your Gothique title fail'd. Arcos. The Successours of Rodrique still remain; And ever since have held some part of Spain. Ev'n in the midst of your victorious pow'rs Th'Asturia's, and all Portugal were ours. You have no right, except you force allow; And if yours then was just, so ours is now. Boab. 'Tis true; from force the noblest title springs; I therefore hold from that, which first made Kings. Arcos. Since then by force you prove your title true, Ours must be just; because we claim from you. When with your Father you did joyntly reign, Invading with your Moores the South of Spain, I, who that day the Christians did command, Then took; and brought you bound to Ferdinand. Boab. Ile hear no more; defer what you would say: In private wee'l discourse some other day. Arcos. Sir, you shall hear, however you are loath, That, like a perjur'd Prince, you broke your oath. To gain your freedom you a Contract sign'd, By which your Crown you to my King resign'd. From thenceforth as his Vassail holding it, And paying tribute, such as he thought fit: Contracting, when your Father came to dye, To lay aside all marks of Royalty: And at Purchena privately to live; Which, in exchange, King Ferdinand did give. Boab. The force us'd on me, made that Contract voyd: Arcos. Whey have you then its benefits enjoy'd? By it you had not only freedome then, But since had ayd of mony and of men. And, when Granada for your Uncle held, You were by us restor'd, and he expel'd. Since that, in peace we let you reap your grain, Recall'd our Troops that us'd to beat your Plain, And moreâ Almanz. Yes, yes, you did with wondrous care Against his Rebels prosecute the war, While he secure in your protection, slept, For him you took, but for your selves you kept. Thus, as some fawning usurer does feed With present summs th'unwary Unthrifts need; You sold your kindness at a boundless rate, And then orepaid the debt from his Estate: Which, mouldring piecemeal, in you hands did fall; Till now at last you came to swoop it all. Arcos. The wrong you do my King I cannot bear; Whose kindness you would odiously compare. Th'Estate was his; which yet, since you deny, He's now content in his own wrong to buy. Almanz. And he shall buy it dear what his he calls: We will not give one stone from out these Walls. Boab. Take this for answer, thenâ What 'ere your arms have conquer'd of my land I will, for peace, resign to Ferdinand: To harder terms my mind I cannot bring; But as I still have liv'd, will dye a King. Arcos. Since thus you have resolv'd, henceforth prepare For all the last extremities of war: My King his hope from heavens assistance draws: Almanz. The Moors have Heav'n and me t'assist their cause. Exit Arcos. Enter Esperanza. Esper. Fair Almahide. (Who did with weeping eyes these discords see, And fears the omen may unlucky be:) Prepares a Zambra to be danc'd this Night, In hope soft pleasures may your minds unite. Boab. My Mistris gently chides the fault I made: But tedious business has my love delay'd; Business, which dares the joyes of Kings invade. Almanz. First let us sally out, and meet the foe: Abdalla. Led on by you we to Triumph goe. Boab. Then, with the day let war and tumult cease: The night be sacred to our love and peace: 'Tis just some joyes on weary Kings shoul waite; 'Tis all we gain by being slaves of State. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Abdalla, Abdelmelech, Ozmyn, Zulema, Hamet, as returning from the Sally. Abdal. This happy day does to Granada bring A lasting peace; and triumphs to the King: The two fierce factions will no longer jarr, Since they have now been brothers in the war: Those, who apart in Emulation fought, The common danger to one body brought; And to his cost the proud Castillian finds Our Moorish Courage in united minds. Abdelmel. Since to each others ayd our lives we owe, Loose we the name of Faction and of foe, Which I to Zulema can bear no more, Since Lindaraxa's beauty I adore. Zul. I am oblig'd to Lindaraxa's charms Which gain the conquest I should loose by Arms; And wish my Sister may continue fair That I may keep a good, Of whose possession I should else despair. Ozmyn. While we indulge our common happiness He is forgot by whom we all possess; The brave Almanzor to whose arms we owe All that we did, and all that we shall do; Who, like a Tempest that out rides the wind, Made a just battle 'ere the bodies joyn'd. Abdalla. His Victories we scarce could keep in view, Or polish 'em so fast as he rough drew. Abdel. Fate after him, below with pain did move, And Victory could scarce keep pace above. Death did at length so many slain forget; And lost the tale, and took 'em by the great. To them Almanzor, with the Duke of Arcos prisoner. Hamet. See here he comes, And leads in Triumph him who did command The vanquish'd Army of King Ferdinand: Almanzor to the Duke of Arcos. Thus far your Masters arms a fortune find Below the sweld ambition of his mind: And Alha shuts a mis-believers raign From out the best and goodliest part of Spain. Let Ferdinand Calabrian Conquests make And from the French contested Millan take, Let him new worlds discover to the old, And break up shining Mountains big with Gold, Yet he shall finde this small Domestique foe Still sharp, and pointed to his bosome grow. Duke of Arc. Of small advantages too much you boast, You beat the outguards of my Masters hoast: This little loss in our vast body, shews So small, that half have never heard the news. Fame's out of breath 'ere she can fly so farr To tell 'em all, that you have 'ere made warr. Almanz. It pleases me your Army is so great: For now I know there's more to conquer yet. By Heav'n I'le see what Troops you have behinde; I'le face this Storm that thickens in the winde: And, with bent forehead, full against it goe, Till I have found the last and utmost foe. Duke. Believe you shall not long attend in vain; To morrow's daun shall cover all your Plain. Bright Arms shall flash upon you from afar; A wood of Launces, and a moving warr. But I, unhappy in my bands, must yet Be onely pleas'd to hear of your defeat: And, with a slaves inglorious ease remain, Till conquering Ferdinand has broke my chain. Almanz. Vain man, thy hopes of Ferdinand are weak! I hold thy chain too fast for him to break. But since thou threatn'st us, I'le set thee free, That I again may fight and conquer thee. Duke. Old as I am I take thee at thy word, And will tomorrow thank thee with my sword. Almanz. I'le go and instantly acquaint the King: And suddain orders for thy freedom bring. Thou canst not be so pleas'd at Liberty, As I shall be to find thou darst be free. Exeunt Almanzor, Arcos; and the rest; excepting only Abdalla and Zulema. Abdalla. Of all those Christians who infest this town, This Duke of Arcos is of most renown. Zulema. Oft have I heard, that in your Fathers reign, His bold Advent'rers beat the Neighbring Plain; Then, under Ponce Leon's name he fought, And from our Triumphs many Prizes brought. Till in disgrace, from Spain at length he went, And since, continued long in banishment. Abdalla. But see, your beauteous Sister does appear. [To them Lindaraxa. Zulema. By my desire she came to find me here: Zulema and Lindaraxa whisper; then Zulema goes out; and Lindaraxa is going after. Abdalla. Why, fairest Lindaraxa, do you fly [staying her. A Prince, who at your feet is proud to dye? Lindaraxa. Sir I should blush to own so rude a thing, [staying. As 'tis to shun the Brother of my King. Abdal. In my hard fortune I some ease should find Did your disdain extend to all Mankind. But give me leave to grieve, and to complain, That you give others what I beg in vain. Lindar. Take my Esteem, if you on that can live, For, franckly, Sir, 'tis all I have to give. If, from my heart you ask or hope for more, I grieve the place is taken up before. Abdal. My Rivall merits you. To Abdelmelech I will Justice doe, For he wants Worth who dares not praise a Foe. Lind. That for his Vertue, Sir, you make defence, Shows in your own a Noble confidence: But him defending, and excusing me, I know not what can your advantage be. Abdal. I fain would ask, ere I proceed in this, If, as by choice, you are by promise, his? Lindar. Th'Engagement only in my Love does lye; But that's a knot which you can ne're untye. Abdal. When Cities are besieg'd and treat to yeild, If there appear Relievers from the Field, The Flagg of Parley may be taken down, Till the success of those without be known. Lindar. Though Abdelmelech has not yet possest, Yet I have seal'd the Treaty for my brest. Abdal. Your Treaty has not ty'd you to a day, Some chance might break it, would you but delay: If I can judge the Secrets of your heart, Ambition in it has the greatest part; And wisdome then will shew some difference Betwixt a private Person and a Prince. Lindar. Princes are Subjects still:â Subject and Subject can small diff'rence bring: The diff'rence is 'twixt Subjects and a King. And since, Sir, you are none, your hopes remove; For less then Empire I'le not change my love. Abdal. Had I a Crown, all I should prize in it, Should be the pow'r to lay it at your feet. Lin. Had you that Crown which you but wish not hope, Then I, perhaps, might stoop, and take it up. But till your wishes, and your hopes agree, You shall be still a private Man with me. Abdall. If I am King, and if my Brother dyeâ Lindar. Two if's, scarce make one possibility. Abd. The rule of happiness by reason scan; You may be happy with a Private man. Lindar. That happiness I may enjoy, 'tis true; But then that Private man must not be you. Where e're I love, I'm happy in my choice; If I make you so, you shall pay my price. Abdall. Why wou'd you be so great? Lindar. Because I've seen This day, what 'tis to hope to be a Queen. Heav'n, how y'all watch'd each motion of her Eye: None could be seen while Almahide was by; Because she is to be her Majesty. Why wou'd I be a Queen! because my Face Wou'd wear the Title with a better grace. If I became it not, yet it wou'd be Part of your duty, then, to Flatter me. These are not half the Charms of being great: I wou'd be somewhatâthat I know not yet: Yes; I avowe th'ambition of my Soul, To be that one, to live without controul: And that's another happiness to me To be so happy as but one can be. Abdall. Madam, (because I would all doubts remove,) Wou'd you, were I a King, accept my Love? Lind. I wou'd accept it; and to show 'tis true; From any other man as soon as you. Abdall. Your sharp replies make me not love you less; But make me seek new paths to Happiness. What I design, by time will best be seen. You may be mine; and yet may be a Queen: When you are so, your Word your Love assures. Lind. Perhaps not love youâbut I will be yours. He offers to take her hand and kiss it. Stay Sir; that grace I cannot yet allow; Before you set the Crown upon my Brow. That favour which you seekâ Or Abdelmelech, or a King must have, When you are so, then you may be my slave. Exit: but looks smiling back on him. Abdal. How 'ere imperious in her words she were, Her parting looks had nothing of severe. A glancing smile allur'd me to command; And her soft fingers gently prest my hand. I felt the pleasure glide through every part; Her hand went through me to my very heart. For such another pleasure did he live, I could my Father of a Crown deprive. What did I say! Father! that impious thought has shock'd my mind: How bold our Passions are, and yet how blind! She's gone; and now Methinks there is less glory in a Crown; My boyling passions settle and goe down: Like Amber chaf't, when she is near she acts, When farther off, inclines, but not attracts. To him Zulema. Assist me, Zulema, if thou wouldst be That friend thou seem'st, assist me against me. Betwixt my love and vertue I am tost; This must be forfeited or that be lost: I could do much to merit thy applause; Help me to fortify the better cause. My Honour is not wholly put to flight. But would, if seconded, renue the fight. Zul. I met my sister; but I do not see What difficulty in your choice can be: She told me all; and 'tis so plain a case You need not ask, what council to embrace. Abdalla. I stand reprov'd, that I did doubt at all; My waiting Vertue stay'd but for thy call: 'Tis plain that she who for a Kingdom, now Would sacrifice her love, and break her vow, Not out of Love but int'rest, acts alone, And wou'd, Ev'n in my arms, lie thinking of a throne. Zulema. Add to the rest this one reflection more, When she is married, and you still adore, Think then, and think what comfort it will bring, She had been mineâ Had I but onely dar'd to be a King! Abdalla. I hope you only would my honour try; I'm loath to think you vertue's enemy. Zulema. If, when a Crown and Mistress are in place, Vertue intrudes with her lean holy face; Vertues then mine, and not I vertues foe; Why does she come where she has nought to do? Let her with Anchorit's not with Lovers lye; States-men and they keep better Company. Abdal. Reason was giv'n to curb our headstrong will: Zulema. Reason but shews a weak Physitians skill: Gives nothing while the raging fit does last. But stayes to cure it when the worst is past. Reason's a staff for age, when Nature's gone; But Youth is strong enough to walk alone. Abdall. In curst ambition I no rest should find; But must for ever loose my peace of mind. Zul. Methinks that peace of mind were bravely lost; A Crown, what're we give, is worth the cost. Abdal. Justice distributes to each man his right, But what she gives not should I take by might? Zulem. If Justice will take all and nothing give, Justice, methinks, is not distributive. Abdal. Had fate so pleas'd, I had been eldest born; And then, without a Crime, the Crown had worn. Zul. Would you so please, Fate yet a way would find; Man makes his fate according to his mind. The weak low Spirit Fortune makes her slave; But she's a drudge, when Hector'd by the brave. If Fate weaves common Thrid, he'l change the doom: And with new purple spread a Nobler loom. Abdal. No more;âI will usurp the Royal Seat; Thou who hast made me wicked, make me great. Zulema. Your way is plain; the Death of Tarifa Does, on the King, our Zegry's hatred draw; Though with our Enemies in show we close, 'Tis but while we to purpose can be foes. Selin, who heads us, would revenge his Son; But favour hinders justice to be done. Proud Ozmyn with the king his pow'r maintains: And, in him, each Abencerrago reigns. Abdalla. What face of any title can I bring? Zul. The right an eldest Son has to be King. Your Father was at first a private man; And got your brother 'ere his reign began. When, by his Valour, he the Crown had won, Then you were born, a Monarch's eldest Son. Abdal. To sharp ey'd reason this would seem untrue; But reason, I through Loves false Optiques view. Zul. Loves mighty pow'r has led me Captive too: I am in it, unfortunate as you. Abdalla. Our Loves and fortunes shall together go, Thou shalt be happy when I first am so. Zul. The Zegry's at old Selin's house are met; Where in close Council, for revenge they sit, There we our common int'rest will unite; You their revenge shall own, and they your right. One thing I had forgot which may import; I met Almanzor coming back from Court. But with a discompos'd and speedy pace, A fiery colour kindling all his face: The King his Pris'ners freedom has deny'd: And that refusal has provok'd his pride. Abdal. Would he were ours! I'le try to guild th'injustice of the cause; And court his valour with a vast applause. Zulema. The bold are but the Instruments o'th'wise: They undertake the dangers we advise. And while our fabrick with their pains we raise, We take the profit, and pay them with praise. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. Almanzor, Abdalla. Alman. That he should dare to do me this disgrace! Is Fool or Coward writ upon my face? Refuse my Pris'ner! I such means will use He shall not have a Pris'ner to refuse. Abdal. He said you were not by your promise ty'd; That he absolv'd your word when he deny'd. Almanz. He break my promise and absolve my vow! 'Tis more than Mahomet himself can do. The word which I have giv'n shall stand like Fate; Not like the King's, that weathercock of State. He stands so high, with so unfixt a mind, Two Factions turn him with each blast of wind. But now he shall not veer: my word is past: I'll take his Heart by th'roots, and hold it fast. Abdal. You have your Veng'ance in your hand this hour, Make me the humble Creature of your pow'r: The Granadins will gladly me obey; (Tir'd with so base and impotent a sway.) And when I shew my Title, you shall see I have a better right to Reign, than he. Almanz. It is sufficient that you make the claim: You wrong our Friendship when your Right you name. When for my self I fight, I weigh the cause; But Friendship will admit of no such Laws: That weighs by th'lump, and, when the cause is light, Puts kindness in to set the Ballance right. True, I would wish my friend the juster side: But in th'unjust my kindness more is try'd. And all the opposition I can bring, Is, that I fear to make you such a King. Abdal. The Majesty of Kings we should not blame, When Royal minds adorn the Royal name: The vulgar, greatness too much idolize, But haughty Subjects it too much despise. Almanz. I onely speak of him, Whom Pomp and Greatness sit so loose about, That he wants Majesty to fill 'em out. Abdal. Haste, then, and lose no timeâ The business must be enterpriz'd this night: We must surprize the Court in its delight. Almanz. For you to Will, for me 'tis to obey; But I would give a Crown in open day: And, when the Spaniards their Assault begin, At once beat those without, and these within. Exit Almanzor. Enter Abdelmelech. Abdelm. Abdalla, hold; there's somewhat I intend To speak, not as your Rival, but your Friend. Abdal. If as a Friend, I am oblig'd to hear; And what a Rival says I cannot fear. Abdelm. Think, brave Abdalla, what it is you do: Your Quiet, Honour, and our Friendship too, All for a fickle Beauty you foregoe. Think, and turn back before it be too late; Behold, in me th'example of your Fate. I am your Sea-mark, and though wrack'd and lost, My Ruines stand to warn you from the Coast. Abdal. Your Councels, noble Abdelmelech, move My reason to accept 'em; not my Love. Ah, why did Heav'n leave Man so weak defence To trust frail reason with the rule of Sence! 'Tis over-pois'd and kick'd up in the Air, While sence weighs down the Scale; and keeps it there, Or, like a Captive King, 'tis born away: And forc'd to count'nance its own Rebels sway. Abdelm. No, no; our Reason was not vainly lent; Nor is a slave but by its own consent, If Reason on his Subjects Triumph wait, An easie King deserves no better Fate. Abdal. You speak too late; my Empire's lost too far, I cannot fight. Abdelm. Then make a flying War, Dislodge betimes before you are beset. Abdal. Her tears, her smiles, her every look's a Net. Her voice is like a Syren's of the Land; And bloody Hearts lie panting in her hand. Abdelm. This do you know, and tempt the danger still? Abdal. Love like a Lethargy has seiz'd my Will. I'm, not my self, since from her sight I went; I lean my Trunck that way; and there stand bent. As one, who in some frightful Dream, would shun His pressing Foe, labours in vain to run; And his own slowness in his sleep bemoans, With thick short Sighs, weak Cries, and tender Groans, So Iâ Abdelm. Some Friend in Charity, should shake And rowse, and call you loudly till you wake. Too well I know her blandishments to gain, Usurper-like, till setled in her Reign; Then proudly she insults, and gives you cares And jealousies; short hopes, and long despairs. To this hard yoke you must hereafter bow; Howe're she shines all Golden to you now. Abdal. Like him, who on the iceâ Slides swiftly on, and sees the water near, Yet cannot stop himself in his Carrear: So am I carry'd. This enchanted place, Like Cyrce's Isle, is peopled with a Race Of dogs and swine, yet, though their fate I know, I look with pleasure and am turning too. Lyndaraxa passes over the Stage. Abdelm. Fly, fly, before th'allurements of her face; 'Ere she return with some resistless grace, And with new magique covers all the place. Abdalla. I cannot, will not; nay I would not fly; I'le love; be blind, be cousen'd till I dye. And you, who bid me wiser Counsel take, I'le hate, and if I can, I'le kill you for her sake, Abdel. Ev'n I that counsell'd you, that choice approve, I'le hate you blindly, and her blindly love: Prudence, that stemm'd the stream, is out of breath; And to go down it, is the easier death. Lyndaraxa re-enters and smiles on Abdalla. Exit Abdalla. Abdelm. That smile on Prince Abdalla, seem's to say You are not in your killing mood to day, Men brand, indeed, your sex with Cruelty, But you'r too good, to see poor Lovers dye. This Godlike pity in you I extoll; And more, because, like heav'ns, 'tis general. Lynd. My smile implies not that I grant his suit: 'Twas but a bare return of his salute. Abdelm. It said, you were ingag'd and I in place: But to please both, you would divide the grace: Lynd. You've cause to be contented with your part: When he has but the look, and you the heart. Abdel. In giving but that look, you give what's mine: I'le not one corner of a glance resign: All's mine; and I am cov'tous of my store: I have not love enough; I'le tax you more. Lindarax. I gave not love; 'twas but Civility, He is a Prince; that's due to his Degree. Abdel. That Prince you smil'd on is my Rival still: And shou'd, if me you lov'd, be treated ill. Lynd. I know not how to show so rude a spight. Abdel. That is, you know not how to love aright; Or, if you did, you would more difference see Betwixt our Souls, then 'twixt our Quality. Mark if his birth makes any difference, If, to his words, it adds one grain of Sence: That duty which his birth can make his due I'le pay; but it shall not be paid by you. For if a Prince Courts her whom I adore, He is my Rival, and a Prince no more. Lynd. And when did I my pow'r so far resigne, That you should regulate each Look of mine? Abdel. Then, when you gave your Love you gave that pow'r. Lynd. 'Twas during pleasure, tis revok'd this hour. Now call me false, and rail on Woman-kind, 'Tis all the remedy you're like to find. Abdel. Yes, there's one more, I'le hate you; and this visit is my last. Lynd. Do't, if you can; you know I hold you fast. Yet, for your quiet, would you could resigne Your love, as easily as I do mine. Abdel. Furies and Hell, how unconcern'd she speaks! With what indifference all her Vows she breaks! Curse on me but she smiles. Lynd. That smile's a part of Love; and all's your due: I take it from the Prince, and give it you. Abdel. Just heav'n, must my poor heart your May-game prove To bandy, and make Childrens play in Love. Half crying. Ah how have I this Cruelty deserv'd, I who so truly and so long have serv'd! And left so easily! oh cruel Maid. So easily! 'twas too unkindly said. That Heart which could so easily remove, Was never fix'd, nor rooted deep in Love. Lynd. You Lodg'd it so uneasie in your Brest, I thought you had been weary of the Guest. First I was Treated like a stranger there; But, when a Houshold Friend I did appear, You thought, it seems, I could not live elsewhere. Then, by degrees, your feign'd respect withdrew: You mark'd my Actions; and my Guardian grew. But, I am not concern'd your Acts to blame: My heart to yours, but upon liking came. And, like a Bird, whom prying Boys molest, Stays not to Breed, where she had built her Nest. Abdel. I have done illâ And dare not ask you to be less displeas'd: Be but more Angry, and my Pain is eas'd. Lynd. If I should be so kind a Fool to take This little Satisfaction which you make, I know you would presume some other time Upon my Goodness, and repeat your Crime. Abdel. Oh never, never: upon no pretence: My Life's too short to expiate this Offence. Lynd. No; now I think on't, 'tis in vain to try; 'Tis in your Nature, and past remedy. You'll still disquiet my too loving Heart: Now we are friends 'tis best for both to part. [Taking her Hand. Abdel. By thisâwill you not give me leave to swear? Lind. You wou'd be perjur'd if you should I fear. And when I talk with Prince Abdalla next I with your fond Suspitions shall be vext. Abdel. I canot say I'le conquer Jealousie: But if you'll freely pardon me, I'le try. Lynd. And, till you that submissive Servant prove, I never can conclude you truly love. To them, the King, Almahide, Abenamar, Esperanza, Guards, Attendants. King. Approach, my Almahide, my charming fair; Blessing of Peace, and recompence of War. This Night is yours; and may your Life still be The same in Joy, though not Solemnity. The Zambra Dance. After the Dance, a tumultuous noise of Drums and Trumpets. To them Ozmyn; his Sword drawn. Oz. Arm, quickly, arm, yet all, I fear too late: The Enemy's already at the Gate. K. Boab. The Christians are dislodg'd; what Foe is near? Ozm. The Zegry's are in Arms, and almost here. The Streets with Torches shine, with Shoutings ring, And Prince Abdalla is proclaim'd the King. What Man cou'd do I have already done, But Bold Almanzor fiercely leads 'em on. Abenam. Th'Alhambra yet is safe in my Command, [To the King. Retreat you thither while their shock we stand. Boab. I cannot meanly for my life provide: Ile either perish in't, or stemm this Tyde. To guard the Palace, Ozmyn, be your care. If they o'recome, no sword will hurt the fair. Ozm. I'le either dye, or I'le make good the place. Abdel. And I, with these, will bold Almanzor face. Exeunt all but the Ladies. An Alarm within. Almah. What dismal Planet did my Triumphs light: Discord the Day, and Death does rule the Night: The noise, my Soul does through my Sences wound. Lynd. Me thinks it is a noble, sprightly Sound. The Trumpets clangor, and the clash of Arms! This noyse may chill your Blood, but mine it warms: [Shouting and clashing of Swords within. We have already past the Rubicon. The Dice are mine: now Fortune for a Throne. A shout within, and clashing of swords afar off. The sound goes farther off; and faintly dies, Curse of this going back, these ebbing cryes! Ye Winds waft hither sounds more strong, and quick: Beat faster, Drums, and mingle Deaths more thick. I'le to the Turrets of the Palace goe, And add new fire to those that fight below. Thence, Hero-like, with Torches by my side, (Farr be the Omen, though,) my Love I'le guide. No; like his better Fortune I'le appear: With open Arms, loose Vayl, and flowing Hair, Just flying forward from my rowling Sphere. My Smiles shall make Abdalla more then Man; Let him look up and perish if he can. [Exit. An Alarm, nearer: then Enter Almanzor; and Selin, in the head of the Zegrys. Ozmyn Pris'ner. Almanz. We have not fought enough; they fly too soon: And I am griev'd the noble sport is done. This onely man of all whom chance did bring [Pointing to Ozmyn. To meet my Arms, was worth the Conquering. His brave resistance did my Fortune grace; So slow, so threatning forward he gave place. His Chains be easie and his Usage fair. Selin. I beg you would commit him to my care. Alm. Next, the brave Spaniard free without delay: And with a Convoy send him safe away. [Exit. a Guard. To them Hamet and others Hamet. The King by me salutes you: and, to show That to your Valour he his Crown does owe, Would, from your Mouth I should the Word receive; And, that to these, you would your Orders give. Alm. He much o're-rates the little I have done. Almanzor goes to the door, and there seems to give out Orders, by sending People several ways. Selin to Ozmin. Now to revenge the Murder of my Son. To morrow for thy certain death prepare: This night I onely leave thee to despair. Ozmyn. Thy idle Menaces I do not fear: My business was to die, or conquer here. Sister, for you I grieve I could no more: My present State betrays my want of pow'r. But, when true Courage is of force bereft, Patience, the noblest Fortitude, is left. [Exit cum Selin. Alma. Ah, Esperanza, what for me remains But Death; or, worse than Death, inglorious Chains! Esper. Madam, you must not to Despair give place; Heav'n never meant misfortune to that Face. Suppose there were no justice in your cause, Beauty's a Bribe that gives her Judges Laws. That you are brought to this deplor'd estate, Is but th'ingenious Flatt'ry of your Fate; Fate fears her Succor like an Alms to give: And would, you, God-like from your self should live. Almah. Mark but how terrible his Eyes appear! And yet there's something roughly noble there, Which, in unfashion'd Nature, looks Divine; And like a Gemm does in the Quarry shine. Almanzor returns; she falls at his feet being veyld. Almah. Turn, Mighty Conqu'ror, turn your Face this way, Do not refuse to hear the wretched pray. Almanz. What business can this Woman have with me? Almah. That of th'afflicted to the Deity. So may your Arms success in battels find: So may the Mistris of your vows be kind, If you have any; or, if you have none, So may your Liberty be still your own. Almanz. Yes, I will turn my face; but not my mind: You bane, and soft destruction of mankind, What would you have with me? Almahide. I beg the grace [unveyling. You would lay by those terrours of your face. Till calmness to your eyes you first restore I am afraid, and I can beg no more. Almanzor looking fixedly on her. Well; my fierce visage shall not murder you: Speak quickly, woman; I have much to do. Almah. Where should I finde the heart to speake one word, Your voice, Sir, is as killing as your sword. As you have left the lightning of your eye, So would you please to lay your thunder by! Alman. I'me pleas'd and pain'd since first her eyes I saw, As I were stung with some Tarantula: Armes, and the dusty field I less admire; And soften strangely in some new desire. Honour burns in me, not so fiercely bright; But pale, as fires when master'd by the light. Ev'n while I speak and look, I change yet more; And now am nothing that I was before. I'm numm'd, and fix'd and scarce my eye balls move; I fear it is the Lethargy of Love! 'Tis he; I feel him now in every part: Like a new Lord he vaunts about my Heart, Surveys in state each corner of my Brest, While poor fierce I, that was, am dispossest. I'm bound; but I will rowze my rage again: And though no hope of Liberty remaine, I'll fright my Keeper when I shake my chaine. You areâ [angrily. Almah. I know I am your Captive, Sir: Alman. You areâYou shallâAnd I can scarce forbearâ Almah. Alas! Almanz. 'Tis all in vain; it will not do: [aside. I cannot now a seeming anger show: My Tongue against my heart no aid affords, For Love still rises up, and choaks my words. Almah. In half this time a tempest would be still. Almanz. 'Tis you have rais'd that tempest in my will, I wonnot love you, give me back my heart. But give it as you had it, fierce and brave: It was not made to be a womans slave: But Lyon-like has been in desarts bred; And, us'd to range, will ne're be tamely led. Restore its freedom to my fetter'd will And then I shall have pow'r, to use you ill. Almah. My sad condition may your pity move; But look not on me with the eyes of Love.â I must be brief, though I have much to say. Almanz. No, speak: for I can hear you now, all day. Her suing sooths me with a secret pride: [softly. A suppliant beauty cannot be deni'd: [aside. Ev'n while I frown, her charms the furrows seize; And I'm corrupted with the pow'r to please. Almah. Though in your worth no cause of fear I see; I fear the insolence of Victory: As you are Noble, Sir, protect me then, From the rude outrage of insulting men. Almanz. Who dares touch her I love? I'm all o're love: Nay, I am Love; Love shot, and shot so fast, He shot himself into my brest at last. Almah. You see before you, her who should be Queen, Since she is promis'd to Boabdelin. Almanz. Are you belov'd by him! O wretched fate, First that I love at all; then, love too late! Yet, I must love! Almah. Alas it is in vain; Fate for each other did not us ordain. The chances of this day too clearly show That Heav'n took care that it should not be so. Almanz. Would Heav'n had quite forgot me this one day, But fate's yet hotâ I'le make it take a bent another way. [He walks swiftly and discomposedly studying. I bring a claim which does his right remove: You're his by promise, but you're mine by Love. 'Tis all but Ceremony which is past: The knots to tie which is to make you fast. Fate gave not to Boabdelin that pow'r: He woo'd you, but as my Ambassadour. Almah. Our Souls are ty'd by holy Vows above. Almanz. He sign'd but his: but I will seal my love. I love you better; with more Zeale then he. Almah. This dayâ I gave my faith to him, he his to me. Almanz. Good Heav'n thy book of fate before me lay, But to tear out the journal of this day. Or, if the order of the world below Will not the gap of one whole day allow, Give me that Minute when she made her vow. âThat Minute, ev'n the happy, from their bliss might give: âAnd those who live in griefe, a shorter time would live. So small a link, if broke, th'eternal chain Would, like divided waters, joyn again. It wonnot be; the fugitive is gone; Prest by the crow'd of following Minutes on: That precious Moment's out of Nature fled: And in the heap of common rubbish layd, Of things that once have been, and are decay'd. Almah. Your passion, like a fright suspends my pain: It meets, 'ore-powr's, and bears mine back again. But, as when tydes against the Current flow, The Native stream runs its own course below: So, though your griefs possess the upper part, My own have deeper Channels in my heart. Almanz. Forgive that fury which my Soul does move, 'Tis the Essay of an untaught first love. Yet rude, unfashion'd truth it does express: 'Tis love just peeping in a hasty dress. Retire, fair Creature to your needful rest; There's something noble, lab'ring in my brest: This raging fire which through the Mass does move, Shall purge my dross, and shall refine my Love. Exeunt Almahide, and Esperanza. She goes; And I, like my own Ghost appear: It is not living, when she is not here. To him Abdalla as King, attended. Abdal. My first acknowledgments to heav'n are due: My next, Almanzor, let me pay to you. Alm. A poor surprize and on a naked foe. What ever you confess, is all you owe. And I no merit own or understand That fortune did you justice by my hand. Yet, if you will that little service pay With a great favour, I can shew the way. Abdal. I have a favour to demand of you; That is to take the thing for which you sue. Alman. Then, briefly, thus; when I th'Albayzyn won, I found the Beauteous Almahide alone: Whose sad condition did my pity move: And that compassion did produce my love. Abdal. This needs no sute; in justice, I declare She is your Captive by the right of war. Alm. She is no Captive, then; I set her free. And rather then I will her Jaylour be, 'Ile Nobly loose her, in her liberty. Abdal. Your generosity I much approve, But your excess of that, shows want of Love. Alman. No, 'tis th'excess of love, which mounts so high That, seen far off, it lessens to the eye. Had I not lov'd her, and had set her free That, Sir, had been my generosity: But 'tis exalted passion when I show I dare be wretched not to make her so. And, while another Passion fils her brest, I'le be all wretched rather then halfblest. Abdalla. May your heroique Act so prosperous be, That Almahide may sigh you set her free. Enter Zulema. Zulema. Of five tall tow'rs which fortifie this Town, All but th'Alhambra your dominion own. Now therefore boldly I confess a flame Which is excus'd in Almahida's name. If you the merit of this night regard, In her possession I have my reward. Almanz. She your reward! why she's a gift so greatâ That I my self have not deserv'd her yet. And therefore, though I wonn her with my sword, I have, with awe, my sacrilege restor'd. Zul. What you deserveâ Ile not dispute because I do not know, This, onely I will say, she shall not goe. Almanz. Thou, single, art not worth my answering, But take what friends, what armyes thou canst bring; What worlds; and when you are united all, Then, I will thunder in your ears,âshe shall. Zul. I'le not one tittle of my right resign; Sir, your implicite promise made her mine. When I in general terms my love did show, You swore our fortunes should together goe. Abdalla. The merits of the cause I'le not decide, But, like my love, I would my gift divide. Your equal titles, then, no longer plead; But one of you, for love of me recede. Alm. I have receded to the utmost line, When, by my free consent, she is not mine. Then let him equally recede with me, And both of us will join to set her free. Zul. If you will free your part of her you may; But, Sir, I love not your Romantique way. Dream on; enjoy her Soul; and set that free; I'me pleas'd her person should be left for me. Alman. Thou shalt not wish her thine; thou shalt not dare To be so impudent, as to despair. Zul. The Zegrys, Sir, are all concern'd to see How much their merit you neglect in me. Hamet. Your slighting Zulema, this very hour VVill take ten thousand Subjects from you'r pow'r. Almanz. VVhat are ten thousand subjects such as they; If I am scorn'dâI'le take my self away. Abdalla. Since both cannot possess what both pursue; I grieve, my friend, the chance should fall on you. But when you hear what reasons I can urgeâ Almanz. None, none that your ingratitude can purge. Reason's a trick, when it no grant affords: It stamps the face of Majesty on words. Abdal. Your boldness to your services I give: Now take it as your full reward to live. Almanz. To live! If from thy hands alone my death can be, I am immortal; and a God, to thee. If I would kill thee now, thy fate's so low That I must stoop 'ere I can give the blow. But mine is fix'd so far above thy Crown, That all thy men Pil'd on thy back can never pull it down. But at my ease thy destiny I send, By ceasing from this hour to be thy friend. Like Heav'n I need but onely to stand still; And, not concurring to thy life, I kill, Thou canst no title to my duty bring: I'm not thy Subject, and my Soul's thy King. Farewell, when I am gone There's not a starr of thine dare stay with thee: I'le whistle thy tame fortune after me. And whirl fate with me wheresoe're I fly, As winds drive storms before 'em in the sky. Exit. Zulema. Let not this Insolent unpunish'd goe; Give your Commands; your Justice is too slow. Zulema, Hamet and others, are going after him. Abdal. Stay: and what part he pleases let him take; I know my Throne's too strong for him to shake. But my fair Mistriss I too long forget: The Crown I promis'd is not offer'd yet. Without her presence, all my Joys are vain; Empire a Curse; and life it self a pain. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Boabdelin, Abenamar, Guards. Boab. Advise, or aid, but do not pity me; No Monarch born can fall to that degree. Pity descends from Kings to all below; But can no more then fountains upward flow. Witness just heav'n, my greatest grief has been I could not make your Almahide a Queen. Aben. I have too long th'effects of Fortune known, Either to trust her smiles, or fear her frown. Since in their first attempt you were not slain, Your safety bodes you yet a second reign. The people, like a headlong torrent goe; And, every dam, they break, or overflow: But unoppos'd, they either loose their force, Or wind in volumes to their former course. Boab. In walls we meanly must our hopes inclose, To wait our friends, and weary out our foes, While Almahide To lawless Rebels is expos'd a prey, And forc'd the lustful Victor to obey. Aben. One of my blood, in rules of Vertue bred! Think better of her; and I believe she's dead. To them Almanzor. Boab. We are betray'd; the Enemy is here; We have no farther room to hope or fear. Almanz. It is indeed Almanzor whom you see, But he no longer is your Enemy. You were ungrateful, but your foes were more; What your injustice lost you, theirs restore. Make profit of my vengeance while you may, My two-edg'd sword can cut the other way. I am your fortune; but am swift like her, And turn my hairy front if you defer: That hour when you delib'rate is too late: I point you the white moment of your fate. Aben. Believe him sent as Prince Abdalla's spy; He would betray us to the Enemy. Alman. Were I like thee, in cheats of State grown old, (Those publick Markets were for foreign gold The poorer Prince is to the Richer sold;) Then thou might'st think me fit for that low part: But I am yet to learn the Statesman's art. My kindness and my hate unmask'd I wear; For friends to trust, and Enemies to fear. My hearts so plain, That men on every passing thought may look, Like fishes gliding in a Chrystal brook: When troubled most, it does the bottom show, 'Tis weedless all above; and rockless all below. Aben. 'Ere he be trusted let him first be try'd, He may be false who once has chang'd his side. Almanz. In that you more accuse your selves than me: None who are injur'd can unconstant be. You were unconstant; you who did the wrong; To do me justice does to me belong. Great Souls by kindness onely can be ti'd; Injur'd again, again i'le leave your side. Honour is what my self and friends I owe; And none can loose it who forsake a foe. Since, then, your Foes now happen to be mine, Though not in friendship we'll in int'rest join. So while my lov'd revenge is full and high, Il'e give you back your Kingdom by the by. Boabdelin embracing him. That I so long delai'd what you desire Was not to doubt your worth, but to admire. Alman. This Councellor an old mans caution shows, Who fears that little he has left, to loose: Age sets to fortune; while youth boldly throw's. But let us first your drooping Souldiers cheere: Then seek out danger, 'ere it dare appear. This hour I fix your Crown upon your brow, Next hour fate gives it; but I give it now. Exeunt. SCENE II. Lindaraxa alone. O could I read the dark decrees of fate, That I might once know whom to love or hate! For I my self scarce my own thoughts can ghess, So much I find 'em varied by success. As in some wether-glass my Love I hold; Which falls or rises with the heat or cold. I will be constant yet, if fortune can; I love the King: let her but name the Man. To her Halyma. Hal. Madam, a Gentleman to me unknown Desires that he may speak with you alone. Lind. Some Message from the King: let him appear. To her Abdelmelech: who, Entring, throws off his Disguise. She starts: Abdelm. I see you are amaz'd that I am here. But let at once your Fear and Wonder end; In the Usurpers Guard I found a Friend, Who led me to you safe in this Disguise. Lind. Your Danger brings this Trouble in my Eyes. But what affair this vent'rous visit drew? Abdel. The greatest in the world; the seeing you. Lind. The Courage of your Love I so admire That to preserve you, you shall straight retire. [She leads him to the door. Go, Dear, each Minute does new dangers bring; You will be taken; I expect the King. Abdal. The King! the poor Usurper of an Hour, His Empire's but a Dream of Kingly Pow'r. I warn you, as a Lover and a Friend, To leave him e're his short Dominion end. The Soldier I suborn'd will wait at night; And shall alone be conscious of your flight. Lind. I thank you that you so much care bestow. But, if his Reign be short, I need not goe. For why should I expose my life and yours, For what, you say, a little time assures? Abdel. My danger in th'attempt is very small: And, if he loves you, yours is none at all. But, though his Ruine be as sure as Fate, Your proof of Love to me would come too late. This Tryal, I in Kindness wou'd allow; 'Tis easie, if you love me, show it now. Lind. It is because I love you, I refuse: For all the World my Conduct would accuse If I should go, with him I love, away: And therefore, in strict Vertue, I will stay. Abdel. You would in vain dissemble Love to me: Through that thinn Veyle your Artifice I see. You would expect th'event, and then declare: But do not, do not drive me to despair. For if you now refuse with me to fly, Rather then love you after this, I'le die. And therefore weigh it well before you speak; My King is safe; his force within not weak. Lind. The Counsel you have giv'n me, may be wise: But, since th'affair is great, I will advise. Abdel. Then that delay, I for denial take.â (is going. Lynd. Stay; you too swift an Exposition make. If I should go, since Zulema will stay, I should my Brother to the King betray. Abdel. There is no fear: but, if there were, I see You value still your Brother more than me. Farewel; some ease I in your falshood find; It lets a Beam in, that will clear my mind. My former weakness I with shame, confess: And when I see you next shall love you less. (Is going again.) Lynd. Your faithless dealing you may blush to tell. [Weeping. This is a Maids Reward who loves too well. [He looks back. Remember that I drew my latest breath In charging your unkindness with my death. [Abdel. coming back. Have I not answered all you can invent Ev'n the least shadow of an Argument? Lind. You want not cunning what you please to prove; But my poor Heart knows onely how to Love. And, finding this, you Tyrannize the more:â 'Tis plain, some other Mistriss you adore: And now, with studied tricks of subtilty, You come prepar'd to lay the fault on me. [Wringing her hands. But oh, that I should love so false a man! Abdel. Hear me; and then disprove it, if you can. Lind. I'le hear no more; your breach of Faith is plain. You would with Wit, your want of Love maintain. But, by my own Experience, I can tell, They who love truly cannot argue well. Go Faithless Man! Leave me alone to mourn my Misery: I cannot cease to love you, but I'le die. (Leans her Head on his Arm.) [Abdelmelech weeping. Abdel. What Man but I so long unmov'd could hear Such tender passion, and refuse a Tear! But do not talk of dying any more, Unless you mean that I should die before. Lind. I fear your feign'd Repentance comes too late: I dye to see you still thus obstinate. But yet, in Death, my truth of Love to show, Lead me; if I have strength enough, I'le goe. Abdel. By Heav'n you shall not goe: I will not be O'recome in Love or Generosity All I desire, to end th'unlucky strife, Is but a Vow that you will be my Wife. Lind. To tie me to you by a Vow, is hard; It show's, my Love, you as no Tie regard. Name any thing but that, and I'le agree. Abdel. Swear then, you never will my Rival's be. Lind. Nay, prithee, this is harder then before; Name any thing, good Dear, but that thing more. Abdel. Now I too late perceive I am undone: Living and seeing, to my Death I run. I know you false; yet in your Snares I fall; You grant me nothing; and I grant you all. Lind. I would grant all; but I must curb my will: Because I love to keep you jealous still. In your Suspicion I your Passion find: But I will take a time to cure your mind. Halyma. Oh, Madam, the new King is drawing neer! Lind. Hast quickly hence; least he should find you here. Abdel. How much more wretched then I came, I goe: I more my Weakness, and your Falshood know; And now must leave you with my greatest Foe! Exit Abdelmelech. Lynd. Go; how I love thee Heav'n can onely tell. And yet I love thee, for a Subject, well.â Yet, whatsoever Charms a Crown can bring, A Subject's greater then a little King. I will attend till Time this Throne secure; And, when I climb, my footing shall be sure. [Musique without. Musique! and I, believe, addrest to me. SONG. 1. Wherever I am, and whatever I doe; My Phillis is still in my mind: When angry I mean not to Phillis to goe, My Feet of themselves the way find: Unknown to my self I am just at her door, And when I would raile, I can bring out no more, Than Phillis too fair and unkind! 2. VVhen Phillis I see, my Heart bounds in my Breast, And the Love I would stifle is shown: But asleep, or awake, I am never at rest When from my Eyes Phillis is gone! Sometimes a sad Dream does delude my sad mind, But, alas, when I wake and no Phillis I find How I sigh to my self all alone. 3. Should a King be my Rival in her I adore He should offer his Treasure in vain: O let me alone to be happy and poor, And give me my Phillis again: Let Phillis be mine, and but ever be kind I could to a Desart with her be confin'd, And envy no Monarch his Raign. 4. Alas, I discover too much of my Love, And she too well knows her own power! She makes me each day a new Martyrdom prove, And makes me grow jealous each hour: But let her each minute torment my poor mind I had rather love Phillis both False and Unkind, Then ever be freed from her Pow'r. Abdalla enters with Guards. Abdal. Now, Madam, at your Feet, a King you see: Or, rather, if you please, a Scepter'd Slave; 'Tis just you should possess the pow'r you gave. Had Love not made me yours, I yet had bin But the first Subject to Boabdelin. Thus Heav'n declares the Crown I bring, your due: And had forgot my Title, but for you. Lynd. Heav'n to your Merits will, I hope be kind; But, Sir, it has not yet declar'd its mind. 'Tis true, it holds the Crown above your Head; But does not fix it till your Brother's dead. Abdal. All, but th'Alhambra, is within my pow'r. And that, my forces goe to take this hour. Lynd. When, with its Keys, your Brothers Head you bring I shall believe you are indeed a King. Abdal. But, since th'events of all things doubtful are, And, of Events, most doubtful those of Warre, I beg to know before, if Fortune frown, Must I then loose your Favour with my Crown? Lynd. You'll soon return a Conquerour again; And therefore, Sir, your question is in vain. Abdall. I think to certain Victory I move; But you may more assure it by your Love. That grant will make my arms invincible. Lynd. My pray'rs and wishes your success foretell. Go then, and fight, and think you fight for me; I wait but to reward your Victory. Abdal. But if I loose it, must I loose you too? Lynd. You are too curious if you more would know. I know not what my future thoughts, will be: Poor womens thoughts are all Extempore. Wise men, indeed; Before hand a long chain of thoughts produce; But ours are onely for our present use. Abdal. Those thoughts you will not know, too well declare You mean to waite the final doom of Warr. Lynd. I finde you come to quarrel with me now: Would you know more of me then I allow? Whence are you grown that great Divinity That with such ease into my thoughts can pry? Indulgence does not with some tempers sute; I see I must become more absolute. Abdalla. I must submit; On what hard terms so e're my peace be bought. Lynd. Submit! you speak as you were not in fault? 'Tis evident the injury is mine; For why should you my secret thoughts divine? Abdal. Yet if we might be judg'd by Reasons Laws! Lynd. Then you would have your reason judge my cause? Either confess your fault or hold your tongue; For I am sure I'm never in the wrong. Abdalla. Then I acknowledge it. Lynd. Then I forgive. Abdall. Under how hard a Law poor Lovers live! Who, like the vanquish'd, must their right release: And with the loss of reason, buy their peace. [aside. Madam, to show that you my pow'r command, I put my life and safety in your hand: Dispose of the Albayzin as you please: To your fair hands I here resign the keyes. Lyn. I take your gift because your love it shows; And faithful Selin for Alcalde choose. Abdall. Selin, from her alone your Orders take: This one request, yet, Madam, let me make That, from those turrets, you th'assault will see; And Crown, once more, my arms with Victorie. Leads her out. Selin remaines with Gazul and Reduan his Servants. Selin. Gazul, go tell my daughter that I waite: You, Reduan, bring the Pris'ner to his fate. Exeunt Gazul and Reduan. 'Ere of my charge I will possession take, A bloody sacrifice I mean to make: The Manes of my son shall smile this day, While I in blood my Vows of Vengeance pay. Enter, at one door Benzayda with Gazul, at the other Ozmyn bound, with Reduan. Selyn. I sent, Benzaida, to glad your eies: These rites we owe your brothers Obsequies. To Gazul. and Reduan. You two th'accurst Abencerrago bind, You need no more t'instruct you in my mind. They bind him to one corner of the Stage. Benz. In what sad Object am I call'd to share, Tell me, what is it, Sir, you here prepare. Selin. 'Tis, what your dying brother did bequeath, A Scene of Vengeance, and a Pomp of death. Benz. The horrid Spectacle my Soul does fright; I want the heart to see the dismal sight. Selin. You are my principal invited ghest: Whose eies I would not onely feed but feast: You are to smile at his last groaning breath, And laugh to see his eye-balls rowle in death: To judge the lingring Souls convulsive strife; VVhen thick short breath, catches at parting life. Benz. And of what Marble do you think me made? Selin. VVhat, can you be of just revenge afraid? Benz. He kill'd my Brother in his own defence, Pity his youth, and spare his innocence. Selin. Art thou so soon, to pardon murder, won? Can he be innocent who kill'd my son? Abenamar shall mourn as well as I; His Ozmyn for my Tarifa shall die. But, since thou plead'st so boldly; I will see That Justice thou woud'st hinder, done by thee: Gives her his sword. Here, take the sword; and do a Sisters part; Pierce his fond Girl; Or I will pierce thy heart. Ozmyn. To his commands I joyn my own request, All wounds from you are welcome to my brest: Think onely when your hand this act has done, It has but finish'd what your eies begun. I thought, with silence to have scorn'd my doom; But now your noble pity has ore'come: Which I acknowledge with my latest breath; The first who 'ere began a love in death. Benz. to Selin. Alas, what aid can my weak hand afford; You see I tremble when I touch a sword? The brightness dazles me; and turnes my sight: Or, if I look, 'tis but to aim less right. Ozmy. I'le guide the hand which must my death convay My leaping heart shall meet it half the way. Selin to Benz. VVaste not the precious time in idle breath. Benz. Let me resign this instrument of death. giving the sword to her father; and then pulling it back. Ah, no: I was too hasty to resign; 'Tis in your hand more mortal then in mine. To them Hamet. Ham. The King is from th'Alhambra beaten back; And now preparing for a new attacque. To favour which, he wills, that, instantly, You reinforce him with a new supply. Selin to Benz. Think not, although my duty calls me hence, That with the breach of yours I will dispence: 'Ere my return, see my commands you do; Let me find Ozmin dead; and kill'd by you. Gazul and Reduan attend her still; And if she dares to fail, perform my will. Exeunt Selin and Hamet. Benzayda, looks languishing on him with her sword down. Gazul and Reduan, standing with drawn swords by her. Ozmin. Defer not, fair Benzaiida, my death; Looking on youâ I should but live to sigh away my breath. My eyes have done the work they had to do; I take your Image with me, which they drew; And, when they close, I shall dye full of you. Benz. When Parents their Commands unjustly lay Children are priviledg'd to disobey. Yet from that breach of duty I am clear, Since I submit the penalty to bear. To dye or kill you is th'alternative; Rather then take your life, I will not live. Ozm. This shows th'excess of generosity; But, Madam, you have no pretence to die. I should defame th'Abencerrage's Race To let a Lady suffer in my place. But neither could that life you would bestow Save mine: nor do you so much pity owe To me, a stranger, and your houses foe. Benz. From whence-soe're their Hate our Houses drew, I blush to tell you, I have none for you. 'Tis a Confession which I should not make, Had I more time to give, or you to take. But, since death's near, and run's with so much force, We must meet first and intercept his course. Ozmyn. Oh, how unkind a comfort do you give! Now, I fear death again, and wish to live. Life were worth taking could I have it now, But 'tis more good than Heav'n can e're allow, To one man's portion, to have life and you. Benz. Sure, at our Births, Death with our meeting Planets danc'd above; Or we were wounded by a Mourning Love! [Shouts within. Redu. The noise returns, and doubles from behind; It seems as if two adverse Armies joyn'd: Time presses us. Gaz. If longer you delay We must, though loath, yours Fathers Will obey. Ozm. Haste, Madam, to fulfil his hard Commands: And rescue me from their ignoble Hands. Let me kiss yours, when you my wound begin; Then, easie Death will slide with pleasure in. Benz. Ah, gentle Soldiers, some short time allow, [To Gaz. and Red. My Father has repented him e're now; Or will repent him when he finds me dead: My clue of Life is twin'd with Ozmyn's Thred. Red. 'Tis fatal to refuse her, or obey: But where is our excuse? what can we say? Benz. Say; any thingâ Say, that to kill the Guiltless you were loath. Or, if you did, say, I would kill you both. Gaz. To disobey our Orders is to die: I'le do't, who dare oppose it. Red. That dare I. [Reduan stands before Ozmyn, and fights with Gazul.] [Benzayda unbinds Ozmyn; and gives him her Sword.] Benz. Stay not to see the issue of the Fight; But haste to save your self by speedy flight. Red. kils Gaz. [Ozmyn kneeling to kiss her hand.] Did all Mankind against my Life conspire Without this Blessing I would not retire. But, Madam, can I goe and leave you here? Your Fathers anger now for you I fear: Consider you have done too much to stay. Benz. Think not of me, but fly your self away. Red. Haste quickly hence; the Enemies are nigh: From every part I see our Soldiers fly; The Foes not onely our Assailants beat, But fiercely sally out on their Retreat; And, like a Sea broke loose, come on amain. To them Abenamar; and a party with their swords drawn: driving in some of the Enemies. Aben. Traytors, you hope to save your selves in vain, Your forfeit Lives shall for your Treason pay; And Ozmyn's Blood shall be reveng'd this day. Ozmyn, kneeling to his Father. Ozmyn. No Sir, your Ozmyn lives, and lives to own A Fathers piety to free his Son. [Abenamar, embracing him. Aben. My Ozmyn! O thou blessing of my age! And art thou safe from their deluded rage! Whom must I praise for thy Deliverance, Was it thy Valour or the work of Chance? Ozmyn. Nor Chance nor Valour could deliver me; But 'twas a noble Pity set me free. My Liberty and Life, And what your Happiness you're pleas'd to call, We to this charming Beauty owe it all. [Abenam: to her. Instruct me, visible Divinity, Instruct me by what Name to worship thee. For to thy Vertue I would Altars raise: Since thou art much above all humane praise. But seeâ Enter Almanzor, his sword bloody, leading in Almahide, attended by Esperanza. My other blessing, Almahide is here: Ile to the King, and tell him she is neer. You Ozmyn, on your fair deliverer wait: And with your private Joys the publick Celebrate. Exeunt. Almanzor, Almahide, Esperanza. Alman. The work is done; now, Madam, you are free: At least if I can give you Liberty. But you have Chains which you your self have chose; And, oh, that I could free you too from those. But, you are free from force, and have full pow'r To goe, and kill my hopes and me, this hour. I see, then, you will go; but yet my toyl May be rewarded with a looking while. Almah. Almanzor can from every Subject raise New matter for our Wonder and his Praise. You bound and freed me, but the difference is, That show'd your Valour; but your Vertue this. Almanz. Madam, you praise a Fun'ral Victory; At whose sad pomp the Conquerour must die. Almah. Conquest attends Almanzor every where, I am too small a Foe for him to fear: But Heroes still must be oppos'd by some, Or they would want occasion to ore'come. Almanz. Madam, I cannot on bare praises live: Those who abound in praises seldom give. Almah. While I to all the world your worth make known, May Heav'n reward the pity you have shown. Almanz. My Love is languishing and sterv'd to death, And would you give me charity, in breath? Pray'rs are the Alms of Church-men to the Poor: They send to Heaven's; but drive us from their door. Almah. Cease; cease a Sute So vain to you and troublesome to me, If you will have me think that I am free. If I am yet a Slave my bonds I'le bear, But what I cannot grant, I will not hear. Almanz. You wonnot hear! you must both Hear and grant; For, Madam, there's an impudence in want. Almah. Your way is somewhat strange to ask Relief; You ask with threatning, like a begging Thief. Once more Almanzor, tell me, am I free? Almanz. Madam, you are from all the Worldâbut me. But as a Pyrate, when he frees the Prize He took from Friends, sees the rich Merchandize, And after he has freed it, justly buys, So when I have restor'd your Liberty,â But, then, alas, I am too poor to buy! Almah. Nay now you use me just as Pyrats do: You free me; but expect a ransome too. Almanz. You've all the freedom that a Prince can have: But Greatness cannot be without a Slave. A Monarch never can in private move; But still is haunted with officious Love. So small an inconvenience you may bear, 'Tis all the Fine Fate sets upon the Fair. Almah. Yet Princes may retire when e're they please; And breath free Air from out their Palaces: They goe sometimes unknown to shun their State; And then, 'tis manners not to know or wait. Almanz. If not a Subject then a Ghost I'le be; And from a Ghost, you know, no place is free. Asleep, Awake, I'le haunt you every where; From my white shrowd, groan Love into your Ear. When in your Lovers Arms you sleep at night, I'le glide in cold betwixt, and seize my Right. And is't not better in your Nuptial Bed To have a living lover than a dead? Almah. I can no longer bear to be accus'd, As if what I could grant you I refus'd. My Fathers choice I never will dispute; And he has chosen e're you mov'd your Sute. You know my Case, if equal you can be, Plead for your self, and answer it for me. Almanz. Then, Madam, in that hope you bid me live: I ask no more then you may justly give: But, in strict justice there may favour be: And may I hope that you have that for me? Almah. Why do you thus my secret thoughts pursue, Which known, hurt me, and cannot profit you? Your knowledge but new troubles does prepare, Like theirs who curious in their Fortunes are. To say I could with more content be yours, Tempts you to hope; but not that hope assures. For since the King has right, And favour'd by my Father in his Sute, It is a blossom which can bear no Fruit. Yet, if you dare attempt so hard a task, May you succeed; you have my leave to ask. Almanz. I can with courage now my hopes pursue, Since I no longer have to combate you. That did the greatest difficulty bring: The rest are small, a Father, and a King! Almah. Great Souls discern not when the leap's too wide, Because they onely view the farther side. What ever you desire you think is neer: But, with more reason, the event I fear. Almanz. No; there is a necessity in Fate, Why still the brave bold man is Fortunate: He keeps his object ever full in sight, And that assurance holds him firm, and right. True, 'tis a narrow path that leads to bliss, But right before there is no precipice: Fear makes men look aside, and then their footing miss. Almah. I do your merit all the right I can; Admiring Vertue in a private man: I onely wish the King may grateful be, And that my Father with my Eyes may see. Might I not make it as my last request (Since humble carriage sutes a Suppliant best) That you would somewhat of your fierceness hide: That inborn fire; I do not call it pride. Almanz. Born, as I am still to command, not sue, Yet you shall see that I can beg for you. And if your Father will require a Crown, Let him but name the Kingdom, 'tis his own. I am, but while I please, a private man; I have that Soul which Empires first began: From the dull crowd which every King does lead, I will pick out whom I will choose to head: The best and bravest Souls I can select. And on their Conquer'd Necks my Throne erect. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Abdalla alone, under the walls of the Albayzin. Abd. While she is mine, I have not yet lost all: But, in her Arms, shall have a gentle fall: Blest in my Love, although in war o'recome, I fly, like Anthony from Actium, To meet a better Cleopatra here. You of the Watch: you of the Watch: appear. [Souldier above. Who calls below? What's your demand? Abdal. 'Tis I: Open the Gate with speed; the Foe is nigh. Sol. What Orders for admittance do you bring? Abdal. Slave, my own Orders; look and know the King. Sold. I know you, but my charge is so severe. That none, without exception, enter here. Abdal. Traytor, and Rebel, thou shalt shortly see Thy Orders are not to extend to me. [Lyndaraxa above. What saucy slave so rudely does exclaim, And brands my Subject with a Rebels name? Abdal. Dear Lyndaraxa haste; the Foes pursue. Lynd. My Lord the Prince Abdalla, is it you? I scarcely can believe the words I hear: Could you so coursly Treat my Officer? Abdal. He forc'd me, but the danger nearer draws, When I am enterd you shall know the cause. Lynd. Enterd! Why have you any business here? Abdal. I am pursu'd; the Enemy is neer. Lynd. Are you pursu'd, and do you thus delay To save your self? make haste, my Lord, away. Abdal. Give me not cause to think you mock my grief: What place have I, but this, for my relief? Lynd. This favour does your handmaid much oblige, But we are not provided for a siege. My Subjects few; and their provision thin; The foe is strong without, we weak within. This to my noble Lord may seem unkind, But he will weigh it in his Princely mind: And pardon her, who does assurance want So much, she blushes, when she cannot grant. Abdal. Yes, you may blush; and you have cause to weep; Is this the faith you promis'd me to keep? Ah yet, if to a Lover you will bring No succour; give your succour to a King. Lynd. A King is he whom nothing can withstand; Who men and money can with ease command: A King is he whom fortune still does bless: He is a King, who does a Crown possess. If you would have me think that you are he, Produce to view your marks of Soveraignty. But, if your self alone for proof you bring, You're but a single person; not a King. Abdal. Ingrateful Maid, did I for this rebel? I say no more; but I have lov'd too well. Lynd. Who but your self did that Rebellion move? Did I 'ere promise to receive your Love? Is it my fault you are not fortunate? I love a King, but a poor Rebel hate. Abdal. VVho follow Fortune still are in the right.â But let me be protected here this night. Lynd. The place to morrow will be circled round; And then no way will for your flight be found. Abdalla. I hear my Enemies just coming on; trampling within. Protect me but one hour, till they are gone. Lind. They'l know you have been here; it cannot be, That very hour you stay will ruine me. For if the foe behold our Enterview, I shall be thought a Rebel too like you: Haste hence; and that your flight, may prosperous prove; I'le recommend you to the pow'rs above. Exit Lyndaraxa from above. Abdal. She's gone; ah faithless and ingrateful maid! I fear some tread; and fear I am betrai'd: I'll to the Spanish King; and try if he To count'nance his own right, will succour me. There is more faith in Christian Dogs, than thee. Exit. Ozmyn. Benzayda. Abenamar. Benz. I wish (To merit all these thanks) I could have said My pity onely did his vertue aid: 'Twas pity; but 'twas of a Lovesick Maid. His manly suffering my esteem did move; That bred Compassion; and Compassion, Love. Ozmin. O blessing sold me at too cheap a rate! My danger was the benefit of fate. To his father. But that you may my fair deliverer know, She was not only born our house's foe. But to my death by pow'rful reasons, led, At least, in justice she might wish me dead. Aben. But why thus long do you her name conceale? Ozmyn. To gain belief for what I now reveal: E'ven thus prepar'd, you scarce can think it true The Saver of my life, from Selin drew Her birth; and was his Sister whom I slew. Aben. No more; it cannot, was not, must not be: Upon my blessing, say not it was she. The daughter of the onely man I hate! Two Contradictions twisted in a fate! Ozmyn. The mutual hate which you and Selin bore, Does but exalt her generous pity more. Could she a brothers death forgive to me, And cannot you forget her family? Can you so ill requite the life I owe To reckon her, who gave it, still your foe? It lends too great a luster to her line To let her vertue, ours so much out-shine. Aben. Thou giv'st her line th'advantage which they have By meanly taking of the life they gave. Grant that it did in her a pity show, But would my Son be pity'd by a foe? She has the glory of thy act defac'd: Thou kild'st her brother; but she triumphs last: Poorly for us our Enmity would cease; When we are beaten we receive a peace. Benz. If that be all in which you disagree, I must confess 'twas Ozmyn conquer'd me. Had I beheld him basely beg his life, I should not now submit to be his wife. But when I saw his courage death control, I paid a secret homage to his Soul; And thought my cruel father much too blame; Since Ozmyn's vertue his revenge did shame. Aben. What constancy canst thou 'ere hope to finde In that unstable, and soon conquer'd mind; What piety canst thou expect from her Who could forgive a Brothers Murderer? Or, what obedience hop'st thou to be pay'd From one who first her father disobey'd? Ozmyn. Nature that bids us Parents to obey, Bids parents their commands by Reason weigh. And you her vertue by your praise did own, Before you knew by whom the act was done. Aben. Your reasons speak too much of insolence, Her birth's a crime past pardon or defence. Know, that as Selin was not won by thee, Neither will I by Selins daughter be. Leave her, or cease henceforth to be my Son: This is my will: and this I will have done. Exit Abenamar. Ozmyn. It is a murdring will! That whirls along with an impetuous sway; And like chain-shot, sweeps all things in its way. He does my honour want of duty call; To that, and love he has no right at all. Benz. No, Ozmyn, no, it is much less ill To leave me than dispute a Fathers will: If I had any title to your love, Your fathers greater right does mine remove: Your vows and faith I give you back agen; Since neither can be kept without a sin. Ozmyn. Nothing but death my vows can give me back: They are not yours to give, nor mine to take. Benz. Nay, think not, though I could your vows resign, My love or vertue could dispence with mine. I would extinguish your unlucky fire, To make you happy in some new desire: I can preserve enough for me and you: And love, and be unfortunate for two. Ozmyn. In all that's good and great, You vanquish me so fast, that in the end I shall have nothing left me to defend. From every Post you force me to remove; But let me keep my last retrenchment, Love. Benz. Love then, my Ozmyn; I will be content [giving her hand. To make you wretched by your own consent: Live poor, despis'd, and banish'd for my sake: And all the burden of my sorrows take. For, as for me, in what soe're estate, While I have you, I must be fortunate. Ozmyn. Thus then, secur'd of what we hold most dear, (Each others love,) we'll goâI know not where. For where, alas, should we our flight begin? The foes without; our parents are within. Benz. I'le fly to you; and you shall fly to me: Our flight but to each others armes shall be. To providence and chance permit the rest; Let us but love enough and we are blest. Exeunt. Enter Boabdelin, Abenamar, Abdelmelech. Guard, Zulema, and Hamet prisoners. Abdel. They're Lindraxa's brothers; for her sake Their lives, and pardon my request I make. Boab. Then Zulema and Hamet live; but know Your lives to Abdelmelechs sute you owe. Zul. The grace receiv'd so much my hope exceeds That words come weak and short to answer deeds. You've made a venture, Sir, and time must show, If this great mercy you did well bestow. Boabd. You, Abdelmelech, haste before 'tis night; And close pursue my Brother in his flight. Exeunt Abdelmelech, Zulema, Hamet. Enter Almanzor, Almahide, and Esperanza. But see with Almahide, The brave Almanzor comes, whose conquering sword That Crown it once took from me, has restor'd. How can I recompence so great desert! Almanz. I bring you, Sir, perform'd in every part My Promise made; Your foes are fled or slain; Without a Rival, absolute you reign. Yet, though in justice, this enough may be, It is too little to be done by me: I beg to goe Where my own Courage and your fortune calls, To chase these Misbelievers from our Walls. I cannot breath within this narrow space; My heart's too big; and swells beyond the place. Boab. You can perform, brave warrior, what you please, Fate listens to your voice, and then decrees. Now I no longer fear the Spanish pow'rs; Already we are free and Conquerours. Almanz. Accept great King, tomorrow from my hand, The captive head of conquer'd Ferdinand. You shall not only what you lost regain, But, 'ore the Byscayn Mountains to the Mayn, Extend your sway, where never Moor did reign. Aben. What in another Vanity would seem, Appears but noble Confidence in him. No haughty boasting; but a manly pride: A Soul too fiery, and too great to guide: He moves excentrique, like a wandring star; Whose Motion's just; though 'tis not regular. Boab. It is for you, brave Man, and only you Greatly to speake, and yet more greatly do. But, if your Benefits too far extend, I must be left ungrateful in the end: Yet somewhat I would pay Before my debts above all reck'ning grow; To keep me from the shame of what I owe. But youâ Are conscious to your self of such desert, That of your gift I fear to offer part. Almanz. When I shall have declar'd my high request, So much presumption there will be confest, That you will find your gifts I do not shun; But rather much o're-rate the service done. Boab. Give wing to your desires, and let 'em fly; Secure, they cannot mount a pitch too high. So bless me Alha both in peace and war, As I accord what 'ere your wishes are. Almanz. putting one knee on the ground. Emboldn'd by the promise of a Prince I ask this Lady now with Confidence. Boab. You ask the onely thing I cannot grant. The King and Aben. look amazedly on each other. But, as a stranger, you are ignorant. Of what by publick fame my Subjects know; She is my Mistress: Aben. And my daughter too. Almanz. Believe, old Man, that I her father knew: What else should make Almanzor, kneel to you? Nor doubt, Sir, but your right to her was known: For had you had no claim but love alone, I could produce a better of my own. Almahide softly to him. Almanzor, you forget my last request: Your words have too much haughtiness exprest. Is this the humble way you were to move? Almanzor to her. I was too far transported by my love. Forgive me; for I had not learn'd to sue To any thing before, but Heav'n and you. Sir, at your feet, I make it my requestâ To the King. first line kneeling: second rising: and boldly. Though, without boasting I deserve her best. For you, her love with gaudy titles sought, But I her heart with blood and dangers bought. Boab. The blood which you have shed in her defence Shall have in time a fitting recompence: Or, if you think your services delai'd, Name but your price, and you shall soon be pai'd. Alman. My price! why, King, you do not think you deal With one, who sets his services to sale? Reserve your gifts for those who gifts regard; And know I think my self above reward. Boab. Then sure you are some Godhead; and our care Must be to come with Incence, and with Pray'r. Almanz. As little as you think your self oblig'd, You would be glad to do't, when next besieg'd. But I am pleas'd there should be nothing due; For what I did was for my self not you. Boab. You, with contempt, on meaner gifts look down; And, aiming at my Queen, disdain my Crown. That Crown restor'd, deserves no recompence, Since you would rob the fairest Jewel thence. Dare not henceforth ungrateful me to call; What 'ere I ow'd you, this has cancell'd all. Alman. I'll call thee thankless, King; and perjur'd both: Thou swor'st by Alha; and hast broke thy oath. But thou dost well: thou tak'st the cheapest way; Not to own services thou canst not pay. Boab. My patience more then payes thy service past; But know this insolence shall be thy last. Hence from my sight, and take it as a grace Thou liv'st, and art but banish'd from the place. Almanz. Where 'ere I goe there can no exile be; But from Almanzor's sight I banish thee: I will not now, if thou wouldst beg me, stay; But I will take my Almahide away. Stay thou with all thy Subjects here: but know We leave thy City empty when we go. Takes Almahide's hand. Boabdelin. Fall on; take; kill the Traytour. The Guards fall on him: he makes at the King through the midst of them; and falls upon him; they disarm him; and rescue the King. Almanz. Base, and poor, Blush that thou art Almanzor's Conquerour. Almahide wrings her hands: then turns and veyles her face. Farewell my Almahide! Life of it self will goe, now thou art gone, Like flies in Winter when they loose the Sun. Abenamar whispers the King a little; then speaks alowd. Aben. Revenge, and taken so secure a way, Are blessings which Heav'n sends not every day. Boab. I will at leisure now revenge my wrong; And, Traytour, thou shalt feel my vengeance long: Thou shalt not dye just at thy own desire, But see my Nuptials, and with rage expire. Alman. Thou darst not marry her while I'm in sight; With a bent brow thy Priest and thee I'le fright, And in that Scene VVhich all thy hopes and wishes should content, The thought of me shall make thee impotent. He is led off by Guards. Boabdel. to Almahide. As some fair tulip, by a storm opprest, Shrinks up; and folds its silken arms to rest; And, bending to the blast, all pale and dead, Hears from within, the wind sing round its head: So, shrowded up your beauty disappears; Unvail my Love; and lay aside your fears. The storm that caus'd your fright, is past and done. Almahide unveyling and looking round for Almanzor. So flowr's peep out too soon, and miss the Sun. [turning from him. Boab. What myst'ry in this strange behaviour lies? Almah. Let me for ever hide these guilty eyes Which lighted my Almanzor to his tomb; Or, let 'em blaze to shew me there a room. Boab. Heav'n lent their lustre for a Nobler end: A thousand torches must their light attend To lead you to a Temple and a Crown.â Why does my fairest Almahida frown? Am I less pleasing then I was before, Or is the insolent Almanzor, more? Almah. I justly own that I some pity have, Not for the Insolent, but for the Brave. Aben. Though to your King your duty you neglect, Know, Almahide, I look for more respect. And, if a Parents charge your mind can move, Receive the blessing of a Monarch's love. Almah. Did he my freedome to his life prefer, And shall I wed Almanzor's Murderer? No, Sir; I cannot to your will submit: Your way's too rugged for my tender feet. Aben. You must be driv'n where you refuse to go: And taught, by force, your happiness to know. Almahide smiling scornfully. To force me, Sir, is much unworthy you; And, when you would, impossible to do, If force could bend me, you might think with shame, That I debas'd the blood from whence I came. My soul is soft; which you may gently lay In your loose palm; but when tis prest to stay, Like water it deludes your grasp, and slips away. Boab. I finde I must revoke what I decreed; Almanzors death my Nuptials must precede. Love is a Magick which the Lover tyes; But charms still end, when the Magician dyes. Go; let me hear my hated Rival's dead; [To his guards. And to convince my eyes, bring back his head. Almah. Go on; I wish no other way to prove That I am worthy of Almanzor's love. We will in death, at least, united be; I'le shew you I can dye as well as he. Boab. What should I do! when equally I dread Almanzor living, and Almanzor dead!â Yet, by your promise you are mine alone. Almah. How dare you claim my faith, and break your own? Aben. This for your vertue is a weak defence: No second vows can with your first dispence. Yet, since the King did to Almanzor swear, And, in his death ingrateful may appear, He ought, in justice, first to spare his life, And then to claim your promise, as his wife. Almah. What 'ere my secret inclinations be, To this, since honor ties me, I agree. Yet I declare and to the world will own, That, far from seeking, I would shun the Throne, And, with Almanzor, lead an humble life; There is a private greatness in his wife. Boab. That little love I have, I hardly buy; You give my Rival all, while you deny. Yet, Almahide, to let you see your pow'r, Your lov'd Almanzor shall be free this hour. You are obey'd; but tis so great a grace, That I could wish me in my Rivals place. Exeunt King &amp; Abenamar. Almah. How blest was I before this fatal day! When all I knew of love, was to obey! 'Twas life becalm'd; without a gentle breath; Though not so cold, yet motionless as death. A heavy quiet state: but love all strife, All rapid; is the Hurrican of life. Had love not shown me, I had never seen An Excellence beyond Boabdelin. I had not, ayming higher, lost my rest; But with a vulgar good been dully blest. But, in Almanzor, having seen what's rare, Now I have learnt too sharply to compare, And, like a Fav'rite, quickly in disgrace, Just know the value 'ere I loose the place. To her Almanzor bound and guarded. Almanz. I see the end for which I'me hither sent; looking down. To double, by your sight, my punishment. There is a shame in bonds, I cannot bear; Far more than death, to meet your eyes I fear. Almahide unbinding him. That shame of long continuance shall not be: The King, at my intreaty, sets you free. Alman. The King! my wonder's greater than before: How did he dare my freedom to restore? He like some Captive Lyon uses me; He runs away before he sets me free: And takes a sanctuary in his Court: I'll rather loose my life than thank him for't. Alm. If any subject for your thanks there be, The King expects 'em not; you ow 'em me. Our freedoms through each others hands have past; You give me my revenge in winning last. Almanz. Then fate commodiously for me has done; To loose mine there where I would have it won. Almah. Almanzor, you too soon will understand That what I win is on anothers hand. The King (who doom'd you to a cruel fate) Gave to my pray'rs both his revenge and hate: But at no other price would rate your life Then my consent, and oath to be his wife. Almanz. Would you to save my life, my love betray? to the Guards. Here; take me; bind me; carry me away; Kill me: I'll kill you if you disobey. Almah. That absolute command your love does give I take; and charge you, by that pow'r, to live. Alman. When death, the last of comforts you refuse, Your pow'r, like Heav'n upon the damn'd, you use, You force me in my being to remain, To make me last, and keep me fresh for pain. When all my joys are gone What cause can I for living longer, give, But a dull lazy habitude to live? Almah. Rash men, like you, and impotent of will, Give chance no time to turn; but urge her still. She wou'd repent; you push the quarrel on, And once, because she went, she must be gone. Alman. She shall not turn: what is it she can do To recompence me for the loss of you! Almah. Heav'n will reward your worth some better way. At least, for me, you have but lost one day. Nor is't a real loss which you deplore; You sought a heart that was ingag'd before. 'Twas a swift love which took you in his way; Flew only through your heart but made no stay. 'Twas but a dream; where truth had not a place: A scene of fancy, mov'd so swift a pace And shifted, that you can but think it was: Let, then, the short vexatious Vision pass. Alman. My joyes indeed are dreams; but not my pain 'Twas a swift ruin; but the marks remain. When some fierce fire lays goodly buildings wast, Would you conclude There had been none, because the burning's past? Almah. It was your fault that fire seiz'd all your brest, You should have blown up some, to save the rest. But tis, at worst, but so consum'd by fire As Cities are, that by their falls rise high'r. Build Love a Nobler Temple in my place; You'l find the fire has but inlarg'd your space. Alman. Love has undone me; I am grown so poor I sadly view the ground I had before: But want a stock; and ne'r can build it more. Almah. Then say what Charity I can allow; I would Contribute; if I knew but how. Take friendship: or if that too small appear, Take love which Sisters may to Brothers bear. Alman. A Sisters love! that is so pall'd a thing! What pleasure can it to a Lover bring? 'Tis like thin food to men in feavours spent; Just keeps alive; but gives no nourishment. What hopes, what fears, what transports can it move? 'Tis but the Ghost of a departed Love. Almah. You like some greedy Cormorant, devour All my whole life can give you, in an hour. What more I can do for you, is to dy, And that must follow, if you this deny. Since I gave up my love that you might live You, in refusing life, my sentence give. Alman. Far from my brest be such an impious thought: Your death would loose the quiet mine had sought. I'll live for you, in spight of misery: But you shall grant that I had rather dye. I'll be so wretched; fild with such despair, That you shall see, to live, was more to dare. Almah. Adieu, then, O my Souls far better part Your Image sticks so close That the blood follows from my rending heart. A last farewel! For since a last must come, the rest are vain! Like gasps in death, which but prolong our pain. But, since the King is now a part of me: Cease from henceforth to be his Enemy. Go now, for pity go, for if you stay I fear I shall have something still to say. ThusâI for ever shut you from my sight. [veyles. Alman. Like one thrust out in a cold Winters night, Yet shivering, underneath your gate I stay; One lookâI cannot go before 'tis dayâ [she beckens him to be gone. Not oneâFarwell: what 'ere my sufferings be Within; I'le speak Farewell, as loud as she: I will not be out-done in Constancy.â [she turns her back. Then like a dying Conquerour I goe; At least I have look't last upon my foe. I goâbut if too heavily I move, I walk encumbred with a weight of Love. Fain I would leave the thought of you behind But still, the more I cast you from my mind, You dash, like water, back, when thrown against the wind Exit. As he goes off the King meets him with Abenamar, they stare at each other without saluting. Boabd. With him go all my fears: a guard there wait; And see him safe without the City gate. To them Abdemelech. Now Abdemelech, is my brother dead? Abdel. Th'Usurper to the Christian Camp is fled; Whom as Granada's lawful King they own; And vow, by force to seat him in the throne. Mean time the Rebels in th'Albayzin rest; Which is, in Lindaraxa's name, possest. Boab. Hast; and reduce it instantly by force: Abdel. First give me leave to prove a milder course. She will, perhaps, on summons yield the place. Boab. We cannot, to your sute, refuse her grace. [One enters hastily and whispers Abenamar. Aben. How fortune persecutes this hoary head! My Ozmin is with Selin's daughter fled. But he's no more my Sonâ My hate shall like a Zegry him pursue; Till I take back what blood from me he drew. Boab. Let war and vengeance be to morrow's care: But let us to the Temple now repair. A thousand torches make the Mosque more bright: This must be mine and Almahida's night. Hence ye importunate affairs of State; You should not Tyrannize on Love, but waite. Had life no love, none would for business live; Yet still from love the largest part we give: And must be forc'd, in Empires weary toile, To live long wretched to be pleas'd a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Success, which can no more than beauty last, Makes our sad Poet mourn your favours past: For, since without desert he got a name, He fears to loose it now with greater shame. Fame, like a little Mistriss of the town, Is gaind with ease; but then she's lost as soon. For, as those taudry Misses, soon or late Jilt such as keep 'em at the highest rate: (And oft the Lacquey, or the Brawny Clown, Gets what is hid in the loose body'd gown;) So, Fame is false to all that keep her long; And turns up to the Fop that's brisk and young. Some wiser Poet now would leave Fame first: But elder wits are like old Lovers curst; Who, when the vigor of their youth is spent, Still grow more fond as they grow impotent. This, some years hence, our Poets case may prove; But, yet, he hopes, he's young enough to love. When forty comes, if'ere he live to see That wretched, fumbling age of poetry; T'will be high time to bid his Muse adieu: Well he may please him self, but never you, Till then he'l do as well as he began; And hopes you will not finde him less a man. Think him not duller for this years delay; He was prepar'd, the women were away; And men, without their parts, can hardly play. If they, through sickness, seldome did appear, Pity the virgins of each Theatre! For, at both houses, 'twas a sickly year! And pity us, your servants, to whose cost, In one such sickness, nine whole Mon'ths are lost. Their stay, he fears, has ruin'd what he writ: Long waiting both disables love and wit. They thought they gave him leisure to do well: But when they forc'd him to attend he fell! Yet though he much has faild, he begs to day. You will excuse his unperforming Play Weakness sometimes great passion does express; He had pleas'd better, had he lov'd you less.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. A pretty task! and so I told the Fool, Who needs would undertake to please by Rule: He thought that, if his Characters were good, The Scenes entire, and freed from noise and bloud; The Action great, yet circumscrib'd by Time, The Words not forc'd, but sliding into Rhime, The Passions rais'd and calm'd by just Degrees, As Tides are swell'd, and then retire to Seas; He thought, in hitting these, his bus'ness done, Though he, perhaps, has fail'd in ev'ry one: But, after all, a Poet must confess, His Art's like Physick, but a happy ghess. Your Pleasure on your Fancy must depend: The Lady's pleas'd, just as she likes her Friend. No Song! no Dance! no Show! he fears you'l say, You love all naked Beauties, but a Play. He much mistakes your methods to delight; And, like the French, abhors our Target-fight: But those damn'd Dogs can never be i'th'right. True English hate your Monsieur's paltry Arts; For you are all Silk-weavers, in your hearts. Bold Brittons, at a brave Bear-garden Fray, Are rouz'd: and, clatt'ring Sticks, cry, Play, play, play. Mean time, your filthy Forreigner will stare, And mutter to himself, Ha gens Barbare! And, Gad, 'tis well he mutters; well for him; Our Butchers else would tear him limb from limb. 'Tis true, the time may come, your Sons may be Infected with this French civility; [illeg.] ages will be done: Our Poet will [illeg.] hundred years too soon. This Age comes on too slow, or he too fast; And early Springs are subject to a blast! Who would excel, when few can make a Test Betwixt indiff'rent Writing and the best? For Favours cheap and common, who wou'd strive, Which, like abandon'd Prostitutes, you give? Yet scatter'd here and there I some behold, Who can discern the Tinsel from the Gold: To these he writes; and, if by them allow'd, 'Tis their Prerogative to rule the Crowd. For he more fears (like a presuming Man) Their Votes who cannot judge, than theirs who can. FINIS.</field>
