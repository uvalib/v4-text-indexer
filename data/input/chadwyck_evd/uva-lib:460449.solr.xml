      <field name="fulltext">THE TAILORS; A TRAGEDY FOR WARM WEATHER, IN THREE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq. Spoken by Mr. FOOTE. This night we add some heroes to our store, Who never were as heroes known before: No blust'ring Romans, Trojans, Greeks, shall rage, No knights arm'd cap-Ã -pie shall croud our stage; Nor shall our Henrys, Edwards, take the field, Opposing sword to sword, and shield to shield: With different instruments our troop appears, Needles to thimbles shall, and sheers to sheers., With parchment gorgets, and in buckram arm'd, Cold-blooded Tailors are to heroes warm'd, And slip-shod slide to war. No lion's glare, No eye-balls darting fire, shall make you stare; Each outside shall belie the stuff within, A Roman spirit in a Tailor's skin. A cross-legg'd Cassius, Pompey, shall you see, And the ninth part of Brutus strut in me. What tho' no swords we draw, no daggers shake, Yet can our warriors a âquietus make, âWith a bare bodkin.ââThen be dumb, ye railers, And never, but in honour, call out Tailors! But are these heroes tragic, you will cry? Oh, very tragicâand I'll tell you whyâ Should female artists with the male combine, And Mantua-makers to the Tailors join, Should all, too proud to work, their trades give o'er, Not to be soften'd by the sixpence more, What horrors would ensue!âFirst, you, ye beaux, Would forfeit all existence with your cloaths. Then you, ye fair, where would be your defence? This is no golden age of innocence. Should drunken Bacchanals the Graces meet, And no police protect the naked street, Beauty is weak, and passion bold and strong: Oh! thenâbut modesty restrains my tongue. May this night's bard a skilful Tailor be, And like a well-made coat his Tragedy: Tho' close, yet easy; decent, but not dull; Short, but not scanty; without buckram, full!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Tailor's Work-Shop. Abrahamides discovered. Enter Bernardo and BartholomÃ«us. Abrahamides. Welcome, Bernardo!âNow, what say our friends? Bern. Great Abrahamides, the chief of all Who led th'embattled Tailors first to war, Success attends you to your utmost wish: Behold, the brave BartholomÃ«us is come, Willing to hear, and aid your utmost aim. Abr. His mien is noble, and bespeaks the Tailor; Not of the Dunghill and degenerate race, But such as the brave Elliot led to battle. Will he not bend before a master's frown? Or flow dissolving in the tankard's tears? Bern. Injurious thought! Bart. To ease you of your fears, I will retire: You'll one day know me better. Abr. Forgive me, stranger, if, in caution old, I fear to trust appearance ev'n like thine. Whence and what art thou? Bart. In Wapping's distant realm I drew my breath; Where long my father held his peaceful sway. Fir'd with the love of liberty and beer, Urg'd by Bernardo's friendship, I am come To offer aid; if aid, so mean as mine, Can aught avail a cause so great, so just! Abr. Say, who thy sire? Bart. The old BartholomÃ«us. Abr. Thrice happy omen! Welcome to my arms, Thou generous son of that brave man I lov'd: We oft in early youth together work'd, On the same board together cross-legg'd sat; In summer cucumbers, in winter cabbages, Together eat. Oft at the skittle-groundâ Bern. Consider, Sir, this time admits no pause For friendship's softer ties: One hour, perhaps, Decides our utmost fate! Abr. Well urg'd, Bernardo.âSay, thou generous youth, How stands thy state? speak, if in peace or war? Bart. In peace profound with all the neighbouring chiefs: Nor that alone; for amity's strict league Unites us all.âFar on the adverse coast, As far as Redriff's ample range extends, Great Christophorides resides in state. While Northward, to Whitechapel's awful Mount, The great Humphryminos, renown'd in arms, Leads the tremendous sons of Spital-Fields. Bern. What are your numbers, and how disciplin'd? Bart. Full fifteen hundred men complete in arms. Abr. A goodly band!âNow, gallant stranger, hear! By good intelligence I'm well inform'd, The tyrant masters meet in close divan, At the Five Bells. Part of their dark design Is known, the rest conceal'd: But, I've ta'en care To place Isaacos, with a chosen band, Instructed to discover, or disturb Their inmost councils from their destin'd aim: Be it thy care to haste Humphryminos And Christophorides to this night's council; While each subaltern chief prepares the men. Bart. I will, brave chief.âWhere is the council held? Abr. Why, at the Orange-Tree in White-Hart-Yard. Bart. 'Till then, farewell! Abr. Nay, quick! be Mercury; Set feathers to thy heels, and fly like thought, From them, to me again! Bart. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed. [Exit. Bern. Spoke like a sprightly Tailor! Abr. A gallant youth! Bernardo, ere the midnight clock has struck, Be thou with me; some doubts perplex my breast Which this night's council must or clear or cure. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Apartment in Francisco's house. Enter Francisco and Dorothea. Dor. Francisco, stay! unkind Francisco, stay! Nor let thy Dorothea plead in vain: Consider, love, thy swaddled legs, thy gout, and all thy pains. Fran. Cease, Dorothea, to perplex my breast With idle fears: Whene'er my duty calls, Thou know'st, nor gout, nor rheumatism can stop me: Cease then to ask for what I must deny. Dor. True, I'm a woman; therefore full of fear; But, tho' my body's weak, my mind is noble, For that is full of thee: On thee I gaze, Watch every virtue, catch the kindling flame! Cease then to tax thy Dorothea's heart With idle fears; those fears are all for thee! Oh, but this night absent thyself from council, And Dorothea then will ask no more! Fran. It cannot, must not be. Dor. Cannot? must not? Fran. Ah, no! Dor. And yet there was a time, my Franky, When Dolly might obtain a greater suit: If she but look'd as if she had a want, Thy penetrating eyes, and generous heart, Watch'd every look, prevented every wish: There was a time, when in the afternoon, As you prepar'd to take your usual nap, No pillow pleas'd but Dorothea's breast; When to the last your eyes would gaze on her, 'Till poppy sleep oppress'd them; she with joy Strok'd thy lank cheeks, and lull'd thy soul to rest: But, ah! that time (I know not why) is past. Fran. Oh, peace! thou fair upbraider, chide no more! Thou know'st my heart still glows with fondness for thee; But, go I must: The fate of all the trade Depends on this night's council; 'tis decisive. Campbello, the great father of the trade, With his own hand hath summon'd: Absence now Would cast reproach on all my former fame! Dor. Oh, didst thou know but all, thou wouldst not go. Fran. What means my love? Dor. Alas, I fear to tell! Fran. Keep me not on the rack!âPerplex no more, But tell me all! Dor. Wilt thou not chide me then? Fran. Chide thee, my love? Dor. Oh, smooth that angry brow, I'll tell thee all.âLast night, I had a dream! Fran. A dream! a dream! Dor. Nay, hear me, ere you blame!â Methought you took me in a one-horse chaise, Unto the Star and Garter, Richmond-Hill. Placid and pleas'd, we had a charming ride: But, while we gaz'd on the rich prospect round, Sudden, methought, I stumbled; anxious fear Urg'd me to catch at theeâat thee, my love, My best supportâbut thou, alas! wert gone: When, lo! far off, the bottom of the Hill, I saw thee rising from the watry Thames, All dripping wet! with eager haste I ran: As I drew nigh, what words can paint my fears, When I beheld blood trickling down thy face: At that sad sight, I wak'd with horror! Fran. Wet? Dor. Dripping wet! Fran. And bloody too? Dor. All a gore blood! and from that hour to this, Remembrance chills me with the very thought! Fran. Trust me, my love, my heart recoils with fear! Dor. Oh, seize the happy omen! stay at home! I'll send a message, that you're sick in bed. Fran. What, for a dream? no; it shall ne'er be said, A dream could awe a Master-Tailor's soul!â Besides, inform me, what's this dream to me, More than the world in general? Dor. Gallant man! [Fran. going. Yet, stay, Francisco, stay! Fran. Thou plead'st in vain! How would St. Clement's sons, renown'd in art, And their proud dames, (whose mantuas sweep the ground, With heads made up of wool, and rumps of cork) Attaint the lustre of Francisco's name, Should it be known, a dream could e'er deter Him from his duty! no; come what come may, I'm fix'd to go; for 'tis our council-day. Dor. Oh, rigid virtue! more than stoick pride! Since then thou wilt go, leave not thy cloak behind: Screen thy lov'd self, thy Dolly's dearer half, From the dank dew, and each unkindly fog: Sure rigid honour does not that forbid. Fran. In that, and every thing that's free from shame, Francisco lives but to oblige his Dolly. Dor. 'Tis kindly said!âWho waits without? come in! Enter Mopperella. Forth from the cloaths-press, fetch the red roqueleau. [Mopperella goes out, and returns with a roqueleau. And now, one parting kiss! one more! farewell! Remember wellâHold, hold, my boding heart!â Whate'er Francisco's fate, his Dolly suffers! Oh, my Francisco! Fran. Oh, my Dorothea! [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A Room at the Five Bells. Campbello, Hagglestonon, Pearcy, Francisco, Regniades, &amp;c. in council. Camp. My friends, a set of worthy men you are, Prudent, and just, and careful for the trade. In various meetings, and with long debate, With no small toil, at length it was resolv'd, This night's conclusive meeting crowns the whole: Whether by open war, or covert guile, We now debate: Who can advise, may speak! Hag. 'Tis true, this point demands our utmost care; And since no generous usage can restrain Those sons of riot, harsher means be tried! For if their insults you unpunish'd bear, A train of horrid ills will soon ensue, Even to the ruin of our antique trade. Therefore, by my advice, be forthwith rais'd A large subscription, plac'd in proper hands, Which may let loose the merciless stern law To hunt the slaves, like hell-hounds, thro' the world! Pear. Much I approve great Hagglestonon's plan. United firmly, we have nought to fear: But if in our own body should be found Some hollow bosoms, men who, void of shame, Prefer ignoble ease to glorious toil, And meanly with their rude demands comply; Should there be such (as worthy cause I have To fear there are) where is your remedy? To what end serves the patriot's honest toil, If silken slaves of ease thus bar success? Ills such as these who can prevent or cure? Reg. That can I. Sage Latitatos, learned in the law, With much sound wisdom prov'd, that not alone The rebels who demand, but all who give More than the stated price assign'd by law, Are liable to prosecution deep. Be it thy care, oh, father of the trade, Thou sage Campbello, with thy utmost strength And speed, to forward Hagglestonon's plan: Spare no offender! then we soon shall know Our friends from foes; as all the wise prefer An avow'd enemy to a doubtful friend. Fran. Rude am I in my speech, and little skill'd In soft persuasive arts; but yet, I trust By facts my injur'd character to save. Nor need I now relate, oh, Tailors here, The services which I have done the trade; They are all known: Arts such as these I leave To them, who think that boasting gives them honour. Yet some, in justice to myself, I mustâ When, at the time of general mourning, all To Bedfordbury, and to White-Hart-Yard, Straight ran in crouds, with haste to intercept Each others' men, submitting to their terms, Stepp'd not I forth, and check'd the rude Barbarians? Who was it first propos'd this very plan? Was that the action of a doubtful friend? Who call'd the general meeting in the Strand? Ye came, 'tis true; but what did ye effect? Ye spent the time in noisy vain debates. Seeing you wavering, and irresolute, With honest scorn, I cater'd for myself: What could I do?âSay, if a baron sends To me for cloaths, what, must I leave him cloathless? Or, if a duke, who pays me nobly, sends For a rich birth-day suit, what, must I say I can't afford to pay my journeymen? Oh, inconsiderate, ungrateful men! Little I thought, that after all my toils, From early youth down to decrepid age, Reproach should ever stain my honest fame; Less, it should come from Pearcy's flippant tongue. 'Tis true, I gave more than the law allows; So have you all: If you call that a crime, From guilt like that not even Pearcy's free. Pear. Who dares name guilt, and with a Pearcy's name? Fran. That dare I! Pear. You know your age protects you; Your safety else you would not hazard thus. Fran. Safety from thee?â Camp. Hold, hold, my noble friends! Restrain your fire, check this impetuous rage, Nor let these sparks be kindled into flame. Pearcy, be dumb, and learn respect to age! Thy worth, Francisco, still will be remember'd, Long as the Tailors' business has a being. Think not, thou venerable man, that words, Hastily dropp'd in council, point at thee; For whosoever strives to wrong thy fame, Will find the dart recoil upon himself. Reg. Ere I would wrong the great Francisco's fame, May my right-hand forget to hold the needle! Whate'er I spoke was for the common good: The ill was general, fatal the effect, Which to prevent was th'utmost of my aim. Pear. Forgive me, sage Francisco, if rash youth Forget respect, so due to age like thine. Fran. Oh, great Regniades, and Pearcy too, Forgive my warmth, if, when my fame's attack'd, My swelling heart e'en bursts with indignation! For what is dearer to a Tailor's soul? Acknowledgment like this restores my love: I am no Scythian, nurs'd with tiger's milk, But yield with joy to friendship's softer tie. Camp. Ay, this is right!âSay, shall I put the question? Is it resolv'd, that one and all unite? Omnes. All, all; all nine, as but one man. Camp. Well have ye done, well ended long debates, Synod of Tailors, like to what you are! Yet, ere we partâ [A noise is heard, of breaking windows and shouting. Enter Waiter. Waiter. Haste, gentlemen! my worthy masters, run! For all the journeymen are up in arms; Caps, hats, and brick-bats fly about the street, And knock down every master that they meet! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Street. Enter Abrahamides solus. Abr. With what unequal tempers are we form'd! What tho' adorn'd with splendor, arm'd with power, Obedient Tailors tremble at my nod; Tho' at each club the chair of honour's plac'd For me alone; what tho' on every slate, My name stands foremostâstill I am unhappy; I groan beneath the complicated pangs Of love and of ambition!âYe jarring pair, Why do you join to rack a heart like mine? Yet why should love be e'er denied the brave? Is there no way to reap the fruit of both? Conceal my love, ambition yet may thrive: Come, plausive Prudence, neither vice nor virtue, Yet worth them all; pale-fac'd Hypocrisy, Lend thy smooth smile to hide my close design: And, friendly Caution, with thy timid eye, Watch, lest some spy should dog me to my haunt. [Exit. SCENE V. Tittillinda's Lodgings. Enter Tittillinda and Blousidora. Titt. Still must I mourn, for ever mourn my fate, Oppress'd by Fortune, and a slave to Love! Oh, would but Fortune smile, Love yet might bless Our future days, and Abrahamides Fill these lov'd arms, with joys unutterable. Instead of thatâ Blous. Torment thyself no more! Think what you are, your present happiness; Great Abrahamides is still thy slave. Titt. In vain you urge me to forget my woes. Blous. How many ladies, in your situation, Would think themselves completely blest to see An Abrahamides sigh at their feet; One who, by general voice of all the Flints, From his sole merit was elected chief! Titt. True, Blousidora, merit such as his Might gratify a woman's utmost pride: Great is his merit; greater still his love. Sure I shall ne'er forget that fatal day When at the Court of Conscience first we met: Urg'd by hard creditors, oppress'd by foes, Obedient to the summons, there I came; Full thirty shillings was the vast, vast debt: Friendless, unknowing in the quirks of law, While the brow-beating justices insult, Forth from the croud there stept a gallant youth, Whose form might claim attention ev'n from queens! He ask'd the sum; then fifteen shillings paid, (His whole week's wages) and subscrib'd a note, By weekly payments to discharge the rest. Blous. Oh, generous youth! But tell me, hapless fair, Was he till then unknown? Titt. His name, his form, 'Till that blest hour, were utterly unknown. Forth from the wond'ring crowd he led me home; Then order'd dinner, and some brandy-punch; Enquir'd my name, my state, sooth'd all my griefs; Then urg'd his passion in so soft a strain! What could I do? my Blousidora, say! Could I refuse the gentle generous youth? Blous. While he is faithful, why should you complain? Titt. Have I not cause? my Blousidora, say! While cruel fortune frowns, he can't support me; My father's doors are ever shut against me: Whene'er that thought occurs, my spirits sink, And my whole soul goes forth in sighs and tears! [Weeps. Blous. Here comes the chief. [Exit. Enter Abrahamides. Abr. In tears, my Tittillinda? Lift up thine eyes, and see who comes to chear thee. Titt. My Abrahamides! Abr. Yes, Tittillinda, Thy faithful Abrahamides is come, To sooth thy sorrows, chear thy drooping spirits. But why these tears? why, with heart-rending sighs, Heaves thy sad bosom? Is there aught on earth, Within my power, I would not do to serve thee? Titt. Oh, generous youth! Abr. Trust me, my love, I fear'd Some rude unfeeling bailiff was the cause Of thy sad tears. But, most of all I fear'd You pin'd for pleasures I could not afford! Titt. Oh, no! all pleasures center in thy arms. I envy not the fair, whose happier fate Nightly affords to go to Sadler's Wells; Or to White-Conduit-House, where butter'd loaves Assuage their hunger; and to cool their thirst, Sweet-sliding syllabub affords its aid: Free be their joys, joys once, alas, my own! Nor yet unhappy Tittillinda's fate, While Abrahamides continues love. Abr. Oh, my soul's joy, if Fortune crown our arms, My Tittillinda shall no longer mourn: A few short hours will soon decide our fate. When next we meet, I'll raise thee to a height, Shall gather all thy gazing neighbours round, To wonder who the devil plac'd thee there. But if we ne'er meet moreâ Titt. What means my love? Abr. Be ignorant, till thou applaud'st the deed. Titt. I seek to know no more than you reveal. Yet, ere thou goest, drink some generous punch, To chear thy drooping soul. Abr. Short be our joys, Whene'er our duty calls.âBut come, my love; If Fate but favour us, our future days Shall roll in peace, in luxury, and ease, And all be crown'd with punch, with pork, with pease. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An apartment in Francisco's house. Enter Dorothea and Mopperella. Mopperella. Cease, my dear mistress, cease these fruitless tears, Nor let the canker Grief destroy thy beauty. My master never later stays than ten, But he sends word. Dor. Oh, you mistake me quite! Far other sorrows load my throbbing breast. Mop. What other sorrows can disturb you now? I'm sure no woman in the parish goes Or better fed, or better drest than thou, Or takes more pleasure in a handsome way. Dor. Happiest of tailor's ladies sure am I; Ungrateful were it to deny the truth. 'Tis true, Francisco drives but with one horse, Nor envy I those ladies drive with two.â But, Mopperella, as you talk of eating, Say, is the sparrow-grass got ready yet? Mop. The water's boiling, and the toast is made; But Betty says she will not put the grass Into the saucepan, till my master comes. Dor. Betty is careful. Mop. Then, dear madam, say, Since you confess that you enjoy all pleasure, A country-house, and town, a one-horse chaise, White-Conduit-House, and every joy beside, Why do you grieve thus? Dor. True, my Mopperella, I have a country-house in Lambeth-Marsh, Genteelly furnish'd; nor need fear, when drest, The envious glance of Madam Sarcenet's eye: Yet, for all this, I am unhappy still. I know not whyâbut, ah! my boding heart Presages ill from this night's fatal council. Mop. What, do you grieve because my master's out? Oh, grieve no more; he will be back to supper. Madam, was I in your place, I protest, I should be merry as a grig all day. Dor. Thou hast no husband, Moppy! if thou hadst, Thou wouldst not prattle at this idle rate: How can a single woman ever feel Those little fears, that nice uneasiness, Which so distinguish every prudent wife? Mop. Madam, tho' single, yet I can pronounce, If I was married, I should love my husband; But tho' I lov'd him, yet I would not fret When he was outâunless he stay'd all night. Dor. Stay out all night? hold your irreverent tongue! [Knocking. Your master comes! I know his knockâbegone! Bid Betty hasten supper: Well I know, When he returns, he's hungry and fatigued. Enter Francisco with his head broke, led by a Waiter. Fran. Here, Robin, here's a tester! Dor. What do I see! Oh, speak, Francisco! ease me of my fears! Fran. Be not alarm'd, my love; but lend thy arm, To prop my feeble steps. Dor. Run for a surgeon! Fran. Hast thou no sticking-plaister here, my love? Dor. I have, my love; and Hung'ry water too. How art thou now? Fran. Better; much better, love; Only a little faint, with loss of blood. Dor. No wonder, love: Did'st thou not faint before? Fran. A Tailor's soul bears all with equal firmness! Dor. But say, my love, how hap'd this dire mischance? Fran. Why, in the middle of our long debate, The journeymen, assembled all in arms, With stones broke every window: Then, whilst I Endeavour'd to oppose (the rest being old) Myself alone, amidst an host of foes, Oppress'd by numbers, senseless fell to earth, 'Till Robin pick'd me up, and led me home. Dor. Where was thy Dolly then, to bind thy head?â But now my dream is out, my fears are gone! Why wouldst thou go, against thy Dolly's warning? Fran. Who can control his fate? All must submit; Monarchs, and Tailors, must submit to Fate. Dor. That's true. Then let me put thee now to bed, And rest, perhaps, will heal thy smarting wounds. Fran. I will; and in the morning soon will get A judge's warrant for that rascal Isaac. Dor. Isaac? who's he? Fran. Why, our late foreman; he Was at their head. Dor. Then trounce him well, my love! But come, get thee to bed; and thenâ Fran. What then? Dor. I'll make my love some whey. Fran. And so you may. [Fran. is led out. Dorothea alone. For Isaac get a warrant? I'm undone! What can I do?âHa! when he's fast asleep, I'll send for Isaac, give him instant notice, That he may shun the danger. [Exit. SCENE II. An Antichamber in the Alehouse. Abrahamides and Bernardo, meeting. Abr. Oh, faithful friend, sole partner of my councils, Thy early industry proclaims thy heart. Bern. None yet arriv'd? what means this dull delay? Abr. 'Tis yet too soon; therefore I bid thee come, To share the troubles that disturb my breast. Bern. Is this a time, oh, chief, to harbour fear, When our long-labour'd scheme is near its birth? Abr. Mistake me not: So cold a guest as Fear Ne'er found admittance into this firm breast. I fear, and doubt of others. Bern. Who? explain! Abr. Hast thou not mark'd, in all our various meetings, Some fearful hearts, still wavering and weak? Bern. Whom do you mean? Abr. Pale Zachariades, Envious Philippomenos, I fear; Ralpho's cold heart; Timotheus' addle brain! Bern. Why do you doubt them? Abr. Oh, I know them well: On the same board together oft we've work'd; Oft have I seen them, with an abject eye, Tremble before the tyrant master's frown, And crouch beneath the foreman's weak dominion. Bern. If thus you doubt, 'twere better to prevent The ills you fear, than wait in vain their cure. Abr. That's my design. Bern. Shall I secure them, then? Abr. Not yet, with open force: With deeper art, We'll make their fears the rulers of their fate. Involv'd in guilt, they'll then have no retreat, But must go forward. This night's hostile act (I know Isaacos will do his duty) Commences war; no hopes of peace remain. Bern. Have you yet heard from great Isaacos? Abr. Yes, my Bernardo, that the blow is struck: That done, they all dispers'd, but will attend Their several duties here. In the mean time, Be it thy care to watch those heartless Dungs; Inform the leaders of the Eastern climes, Redriff, and Wapping, of our honest fears, That when we've singled out these half-made souls, (Should we not bring them to the paths of Honour) Then, like a limb diseas'd, we'll lop them off! Bern. Bravely resolv'd, my chief.âBut sure, 'tis time That we repair to council. Abr. Let's go in. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Club-Room. Bernardo, Christophorides, Humphryminos, BartholomÃ«us, Zachariades, Philippomenos, and Ralpho, in council; Abrahamides in the chair. Abr. Oh, gallant men, chief pillars of the trade! For the last time we meet, to fix the plan Of future action. 'Tis well known to all, Some timid Dungs (unworthy of the name Alike of Tailor or of man; from whom Opprobrious proverbs rise to hurt our fame) Meanly descend to work for half-a-crown. Whilst this continues, all our schemes are vain: What's to be done? Hum. Great Abrahamides, Permit a man, unskill'd in council sage, Yet from plain facts, that have been, thence conclude What may be.âWhen the weaving sons of silk, Oppress'd with debts and hunger, rose in arms, They had divisions then, as we have now: What did they do? whene'er they found a man Doubting or falt'ring, him they strait compell'd: Hence, soon a formidable band arose, And all the sister trades were forc'd to join. Lo! their example points us out the way. Bart. And since, among such numbers, will be found Some dastard Dungs, let chosen bands be plac'd To storm the masters' houses where they work; And at the midnight hour, when sunk in sleep, Break all their windows, frighten all their wives; While others shall assault each house of call, Smash all their slates, and plunder every box: 'Till, by experience, they are taught to know No private safety can depend on aught But on the common good. We want not men, Nor chiefs to lead them. Zach. Measures such as these, Could we insure success, would gain our ends. The Dungs are numerous, and, tho' so base To dread the noble toil of glorious war, Yet that same baseness may defeat our valour. It is well known, before these fatal broils, The Flints and Dungs in friendly intercourse Together work'd, together friendly drank; Hence all are known, his name, his habitation, His house of haunt, and each particular: Should we proceed to force, as is advis'd, With informations they would strait repair To Sir John Fielding; whose fierce myrmidons, At unexpected moments, might entrap Singly our chiefs, and throw them into gaol. Bern. And if they do, they cannot hang us, sure! Breaking of windows is not capital. Zach. But plundering boxes is. Bern. That we'll avoid. Zach. Think on the Riot-Act. Bern. Ere that is read, All our swift-footed Flints, as swift as ducks, Will soon elude their search. Zach. But when asleep Can they escape? may they not then be ta'en? Bern. Suppose they are, is there a man so base, Who fears, for such a cause, to live in gaol, When from each box they will be well supplied With beef, with cabbage, cucumbers, and porter. Fear, more than wisdom, dictates gentler means. Abr. Bernardo, you forget! Bern. I stand reprov'd. Zach. Fear! fear, Bernardo? sure he but little knows Firm Zachariades, who doubts his courage. Bern. Curs'd be the man who doubts it! Well I know, Thro' every purlieu of long Drury-Lane, And Covent-Garden, has thy prowess shone; And White-Hart-Yard is wanton at thy name. Nor is thy matchless hardiness unknown; For, while the slaves of ease repose on down, Oft on the flinty pavement hast thou laid, Hush'd by the murmuring kennel to thy slumbers. I meant not to reproach, but only raise Thy well-known courage to support our cause. Phil. His courage none can doubt; and since all here Are free, with freedom will I speak my mind: I own I think with Zachariades, That gentler means at first should be propos'd, To win as friends, rather than treat as foes. Chris. No generous means will ever win a Dung; Their sordid souls are lost to every sense Of kindness, or of honour: Force alone Can e'er prevail with them. Ye have my voice. Enter Isaacos. Abr. Welcome, Isaacos! what's the news with thee? Isaacos. At first, I strove with subtle art to gain Full information of their dark design; Sounded the waiters; but I found it vain, For their own prentices secur'd the door: That known, resolv'd at last to give no time For future schemes; my troops I quickly form'd, And in an instant, at the signal given, A cloud of brick-bats darken'd all the air, Smash'd every window, deafen'd every ear: Sudden they gaz'd; at the next onset fled, Rout upon rout, confusion worse confounded! Hats, wigs, and bottles, pipes, and Tailors, lay In one promiscuous carnage! Soon all fled, Save those whom wounds or gouty limbs detain'd. Great Hagglestonon, prostrate on the earthâ Abr. White-liver'd Tailor!â There let him lie, and be the earth on him! Isaacos. With him, Regniades, Francisco, fell. This done, we all dispers'd, and all are safe. Abr. Conduct like this deserves our public thanks. Omnes. To great Isaacos our thanks be paid! Isaacos. Oh, you o'er-rate my services too much; All I can boast, is to have done my duty. Abr. Thus, by one brave and daring bright example, You see how vigour will insure success: And, Zachariades, I trust, will own, On that alone depends our future hope. Zach. I meant not to oppose the public voice, But freely gave my thoughts. Abr. Then we conclude, With hostile vigour to compel the Dungs. Omnes. All; all resolve! Abr. In Covent-Garden, ere tomorrow's dawn, We'll muster all our troops; there let each chief Attend for further orders.âGood night to all! [Exeunt all but Abr. and Bern. Abr. What think'st thou now, Bernardo? Didst thou mark The pallid Dungs? Bern. I did; and saw that fear Shrunk their cold hearts, and wither'd every nerve. Abr. They have not hearts to enter into guilt; Them I can never trust: Some safer way Must then be found to rid us of our fears. Bern. Ay, but what way? Abr. Put powder in their drink! Bern. What dost thou mean? gunpowder? Abr. No, nor James's powder: Excruciating jalap! Bern. Ha! jalap! Abr. Gripe-giving Mercury will reach their bowels, And render them unfit for active deeds. Bern. True; that will do: Where is it to be got? Abr. Know'st thou no lean apothecary! Bern. No. Abr. Then buy it at a common chymist's shop. Bern. If we should give too much? What if the powder should not work at all? Abr. Suppose it should not? Hast thou, Bernardo, gone with me so far, Trod every step, and shar'd in every honour, And start'st thou at a paltry accident, Which may or may not happen? Bern. Doubt me not! But you remember what the bakers did, Out of mere fun, and too much jalap given? Abr. Their comrade died, and they absconded: Well! And what of that?âMark me, Bernardo, well: Consider well the precipice we're on; For should we fail, be sure that thou and I To public justice the first victims fall. Bern. No more! thou hast convinc'd me; I'm resolv'd. Abr. Yet hear! shall we, when rais'd thus high, stop now, When one step higher crowns our utmost hopes? Nay, moreâbut this is for thy private earâ If we succeed in this, I have a plan Will free us ever from base servitude, And we'll be masters in our turn, Bernardo. Bern. Oh, worthy to deceive and awe the Tailors! I'll go this instant (for I know their haunt) And, under fair pretence of reconcilement, We'll drink together; just ere the tankard's out, I'll mix the drug, and leave them to their fate. [Going. Abr. A lucky thought.âYet hear, Bernardo. Bern. What dost thou say, my chief? Abr. Full half an ounce! Bern. Depend upon it, they shall have enough; It shall not be a thimble-full. Abr. Oh, noble daring!âThink on the reward: If we succeed, we're masters for ourselves. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Zachariades's Lodgings. Enter Zachariades and Tinderella. Tind. Why, look you, Zachariades! 'tis vain To talk to meâmy children shall not starve. Zach. I prithee, woman, hold thy peaceâno more! Tind. I will not peace, while I have breath to speak. Oh, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth! Then would I rattle thee with such a peal, Thou shouldst comply, or never shouldst have rest. Zach. Nor have I now, or ever shall. Tind. Oh, shame! There's not a meeker-temper'd woman breathes Than Tinderellaâall the parish knows. But 'tis enough to make a parson swear, To see a man run headlong into gaol And starve his children, and as good a wife (Tho' I declare it) as man ever had. Zach. As good a wife?âay, and as gentle too! Tind. Ay, gentle too!âWhat, I suppose you'd have Some meek insipid thing, with folded arms, Would stand or curt'sy, and say yes, or no, As you would have her: No, i'faith not I! I do my duty, you should think on yours. Zach. Why, what the devil ails the woman now? Is not three shillings better far, thou fool, Than half-a-crown a-day? Tind. What's half-a-crown, Or what three shillings, if you go to gaol? Who will maintain your wife and children then? Zach. Each friendly box will yield a weekly aid. Tind. But what if you should be confin'd for years? The box would soon be tir'd. See, hither come Your masters with a warrant. Enter Hagglestonon and Regniades. Zach. Let them come! Hag. Well, Zachariades, to you we come, As to a man whose regularity Has long been known. Say, wherefore would you lose Your reputation thus, to join with those Whom gentle usage never can restrain? Reg. Why will you mingle with such men, whose acts Are all against the law? Zach. Why should not I, As well as others, have my wages rais'd? My work is good as theirs. Hag. Suppose it is, You know the price is fix'd; what is your due Is duely paid. Whoe'er offends the law Will feel, too late, the weight of all its pains. Tind. Did not I say so? Zach. Woman, hold your peace! Tind. No, I will not!âSirs, give me leave to speakâ Hag. Hold; let me speak.âWe now are come as friends, Out of regard to your known worth, to save you From all its penalties; for, be assur'd, Whoe'er is ta'en will most severely suffer. Zach. I shall not, more than others. Tind. Yes, you will. Reg. Ay, that you will: consider well, your wife, Your children. Tind. Think on that! your children, wife! Zach. What would you have me do?âIf I comply, The Flints will strait molest; nor wife, nor child, Nor e'en myself, were safe. Reg. Oh, never fear Those lawless rascals: We will safe protect Both you, and all the rest that with you join. Enter Timotheus. Tim. Oh, Zachariades! Zach. Well, what's the matter! Tim. Poor Philippomenos is almost dead! Ere he arriv'd at home, a cold fit seiz'd, And cruel vomits shatter'd all his frame. Zach. Whence could it come? Tim. I know not; but he fears Some foul play shewn, when late he drank with you And with Bernardo. I must run for help. [Exit. Zach. Foul play! we all drank; it cannot be. Tind. Yes, on my life it can. These are your Flints, your heroes; these the friends You only trust; and when you are in gaol, They'll poison you, to save their pension'd box. Zach. Ay, that may be. Reg. You see what faithless men You are engag'd with: Now consider well, If peace, or safety, e'er can harbour there. Zach. My very worthy, and approv'd good masters, With pleasure, to my duty I return; And so would more, did not their fears prevent: But since you promise us your firm support, I'll seek the others, and consult them strait. Hag. Continue firm, and doubt not our support. [Exe. SCENE V. Covent-Garden. Enter Abrahamides, Isaacos, BartholomÃ«us, Christophorides, Humphryminos, and others. Abr. Welcome, ye Flints, deserving of the name! Ye meet like men who would command success. Say, gallant leaders of the eastern bands, Where are your troops, and how dispos'd your quarters? Bart. Mine are all ready, eager for the fight, And my head-quarters fix'd, with utmost care, Up at the Goose-and-Gridiron, Powl's Church-Yard. Abr. Where thine, brave Christophorides? Chris. Why, at the Bell, in Doctor's Commons. Abr. Where thine, Humphryminos? Hum. Safe at the Hog-in-Armour, in Chick-Lane. Abr. Right well dispos'd!âOh, gallant, brave allies, Matchless as will your glory be hereafter, 'Tis not for meâBut see, who comes in haste! Enter Bernardo. Bern. Oh, noble Abrahamides, this time Calls loud for action, and admits no pause: The Dungs are all in arms, and vow revenge For murder'd Philippomenos. Their troops, In Lincoln's-Inn fam'd Fields, in firm array, Are led by Zachariades; who means T'attack you here, before your forces join, Unless prevented. Abr. Ay, this looks like war! By Heaven, the news alarms my Tailor's soul! But say, which way do they direct their march? Bern. I hear, thro' Serle-Street they direct their course, Then thro' Sheer-lane, and by St. Clement's Church. Abr. By Heav'n, all this falls out beyond my hopes! Haste thou, Isaacos! with thy well-known care, March with thy small detachment thro' the Strand; Watch well their motions, and straight send me word. [Exit Bern. Should they attack you, you'll be well sustain'd. Isaacos. Should they attack Isaacos, they'll meet A welcome, that will scarce deserve their thanks. [Exit Isaacos. Abr. I doubt it not; for thou'rt a Flint of fire! You, Christophorides, from Doctor's Commons, In one small column, thro' those narrow courts That from Black-Friars to the Temple lead, March on your troops; and in the King's-Bench-Walks Directly form; and wait for further orders. [Exit Chris. You, great BartholomÃ«us, from Powl's Church-Yard, March in firm phalanx straight down Ludgate-Hill, And Christophorides at Temple-Bar Will join your troop. [Exit Bart.] While you, Humphryminos, Up Holborn-Hill direct your secret march, And wait upon their rear. [Exit Hum.] Myself the while, With the main body, will attack their front. Enter a Messenger. Mess. Oh, chief, the gallant Jackâ Abr. Eternal silence seize that vulgar tongue! Harry sounds well, the warlike Harry noble! But Jack, vile Jackâdegrading monosyllable! Mess. What shall I call him then, oh, chief? Abr. Henceforth Jackides be his name! Mess. Jackides, then, With all his troops revolted from the Dungs, Is now without, and waits your further orders. Abr. Admit him instantly! Mess. I will, this moment. [Exit. Enter Jackides, with a broomstick. Abr. Oh, brave Jackides, welcome to my arms! Hibernia's gallant son, thy happier isle, Unhurt by luxury, its courage keeps; While Britain's youth, surcharg'd with beef and beer, Degenerate from their fathers, mourn in vain Their antique spirit to IÃ«rne fled. Jack. Great Abrahamides, I cannot spake, But I will tell you how the matter stands: At three o'clock they call'd me out of bed, At little Phalim's, where I lodge; I rose, Went with M'Carty, and my Irish boys; Each of us took a broomstick in our hands, Thinking the masters were refractory; But when we cameâwhat do you call his name? Paleâ Abr. Zachariades. Jack. Ay, Zack; the sameâ He prated much, and bother'd all our brains, And said at last, the masters would support us. The devil burn the masters, and the Dungs! Then straight M'Carty, little Phalim, I, And all our Irish boys, came off to you. Abr. M'Carty? Phelim? tell me, are they firm? Jack. Firm? ay, as brick-bats: They're good fellows both, As ever trotted bog: Set them to work, And then you'll see what pretty boys they are. Abr. 'Tis not their courage, or their truth, I doubt; But wish to know their characters in war. Jack. Why, little Phalim from the White Boys came; I, and M'Carty, from our earliest youth, Among the boys of Liberty and Ormond, Were train'd to arms. [A shout. Enter a Messenger in haste. Abr. Well, what's the business? Mess. The brave Isaacos demands your aid: Close by St. Clement's Church he stood, unhurt, The shock of numerous Dungs, 'till, from the courts, Numbers out-numbering number pouring forth, O'er-power'd his little band. Abr. Jackides, then, Haste with Hibernia's legion to his aid! Jack. Ay, that I will. Fear not! my Irish boys Shall bring you presently a good account Of all these bastard brats, these dastard Dungs. [Exit. Abr. Brothers, and partners in this glorious toil, 'Tis not for me to rouze your courage now: Be but yourselves, and I can ask no more! Consider well, no common cause demands Your present aid, and forces you to arms: The daily six-pence is no trivial point. What are these timid Dungs, whom you oppose? Are not their spirits by oppression broke? And shall the Flints, like them, e'er sink to slaves? Dishonour blast the thought! Remember too, Fame, Fortune, Honour, all are now at stake! Oh, let these noble thoughts swell all your hearts, New-string your arms, add weight to every blow. Draw all your bludgeons, brandish them in air; Huzza! the word, Newgate, or Victory!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in Francisco's house. Enter Dorothea and Isaacos. Dorothea. Must thou then go? Alas, how swiftly fly The hours of love! Must I then be condemn'd To the dull prison of a husband's arms? Isaacos. Oh, I could ever gaze upon that form, But cruel Fortune otherwise ordains; It cannot, must not be: Oh, cursed Fate, That gave thy beauty to Francisco's arms! Enter Francisco behind. Fran. Either I dream, or sure I hear some man Conversing with my wifeâWhat do I see? Dor. Cursed indeed! but, ah! what could I do? Condemn'd to servitude, which suits but ill With Dorothea's spirit; soon I found The dotard lov'd; I watch'd his hour of weakness, And by a well-feign'd coyness fix'd him mine, Then made him what he is: You from that hour, Who always had my heart, have shar'd my joys. Isaacos. Ay, joys indeed, pleasures unutterable, If not embitter'd by these anxious fears! Dor. By fears embitter'd? what's thy meaning? speak! Isaacos. Mistake me not; my fears are all for thee: Should it be known, thou art, alas, undone; And much I fear Francisco should awake. Dor. Why, that is true. Now then, retire with speed; For morning dawns. Remember what I told thee; Haste, and preserve thyself and friends! Isaacos. I will. But say, my fair, can you inform me Whose names, beside my own, are in the warrant? Dor. Bernardo, Abrahamides. Isaacos. 'Tis well. Ah, generous mistress, doubly am I bound By love and gratitude for ever to thee! Farewell! may all good angels ever guard thee! Dor. Retire, my love; and, when the danger's past, You shall not fail to hear from Dorothea. [Exeunt. Francisco comes forward. Fran. 'Tis as I thought! Why did I ever marry? Fool that I was, who vainly hop'd to find That want of fortune might be well supplied By love, and by obedience. Oh, vain hope, To think that gratitude can ever bind A servile mind!âBut what can now be done? If I betray suspicion, she'll grow insolent: What can I do with him? a beggar suedâ The proverb's stale!âA cuckold?âha! a cuckold? Cuckolded by a journeyman? damnation! Couldst thou not, partial Fate, when thou ordain'd I should be cuckold, by a nobler hand Inflict the shame? perhaps I then had found One drop of patience; and a verdict gain'd, Had amply paid me for my loss and shame: Instead of that, to be a fixed mark For all the parish now to point and stare at! By Heav'n, I'll be reveng'd! but how? how?âRight! His name is now inserted in the warrant; And when in gaol, I'll buy up all his debts, And keep him there; and, to torment him more, I'll bribe the gaoler. Beware, Isaacos; Thou soon shalt feel the vengeance that awaits An injur'd Tailor's honour! [Exit. SCENE IV. Tittillinda's Lodgings. Enter Tittillinda, speaking as she enters to Blousidora. Titt. 'Tis needless, Blousidora: While you darn Those stockings, I will mend this ruffled shirt; For well I know you have your hands full all, In this so-general wash.âAnd now for thinking! [Sits down. Perhaps, ere now, the fatal moment's past, And either Abrahamides and I Are doom'd to misery, or completely blest. Fain would I hope, but still am check'd by fear; And yet, who knows? Fortune perhaps may smile: Then, Tittillinda once again will shine, Be ever clean, and ever smartly drest; And fear no more those prudish prying eyes, Which smile contempt, yet envy me my joys. Here comes my love. Enter Abrahamides, hastily. Abr. Oh, Tittillinda, all our hopes are lost! Titt. Forbid it, love! What, could the Dungs prevail? Abr. Eternal curses seize their coward hearts! Prevail they do; but not by Valour's arm. This is no time to tell thee now, my love; For their fell blood-hounds hunt me at the heels. Titt. What can I do? Abr. Hast thou no secret place, Where I may lay conceal'd till danger's past? Home I can ne'er return. Titt. Oh, yes, my love; Within that room a secret closet stands, That will escape the search of keenest eyes. Thither retire. [Noise without.] We must and will come in! Abr. By Heav'n, they're here! The blood-hounds now have trac'd me to my lair. [Exit. Enter two Constables, &amp;c. Titt. Well, what's your business? 1st Con. Madam, we are come In search of a fell murderer; who, we are told, Has taken refuge here. Titt. I know of none. 2d Con. Denying him is vain; for he was seen To enter here. Titt. Whom do you mean? 1st Con. Why, Abrahamides: You know him well. Titt. I do; and what of that? For twice three days I have not seen him here. 2d Con. We cannot lose our time: If you refuse To yield him up, why then we seize on you. Titt. I yield him up? No! was he here indeed, My life should pay the forfeit ere I'd yield him. 2d Con. Then seize her! Titt. Stand off! Enter Abrahamides, and knocks him down. Abr. Hell-hounds, stand off! Behold the man you seek! 1st Con. Then seize on him! Titt. Stand off! Barbarians, hold! Let me once more enfold him in these arms, And take one long, one last farewell! Abr. Oh, cease; Nor vainly struggle with our froward fate!â Lead to my dungeon. 1st Con. Bring him along! Let's have no whimp'ring here. Titt. Hold! one moment hold, 'Till I have caught him once more in my arms! 2d Con. Tear them asunder. Titt. Oh, Abrahamides! Abr. Oh, Tittillinda! [Exeunt. SCENE V. Enter Francisco, led by Robin. Fran. Oh, I am grip'd!âthe working jalap runs Like thoro'-go-nimble thro' my twisted guts! Robin. How fierce his fever is! Fran. Oh, what a change of torments I endure! A red-hot goose runs hissing thro' my bowels; Oh, for a peck of cucumbers to cool it! 'Tis Death's bare bodkin! Giveâgive me a chair, And cover me all over, for I freeze; My teeth chatter, and my knees knock together! Robin. Have mercy, Heaven! Fran. And now I burn again! A Tailor's hell!âThe war grows wondrous hot! See! see the Flints! Isaacos too! I know him By his ragged coat, and unmow'd beard. Avaunt! I'll throw a cabbage at his head! With that Last blow I've brought him down. Oh, for A fire as big as at the Bedford-Arms! The shop-board moves! the needles dance cross-leg'd! The thread's entangled!âOh, cabbage, cucumbers! CabâcabâbageâbageâOh! [Dies. Rob. There fell the pride and glory of all Tailors! [Beckons on two Servants. Bear him off. [As they prepare to carry him, he starts up. Fran. No; I won't trouble you; I'll walk off. Rob. Then, take the chair off. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Newgate. Abrahamides, solus. Why, what is man? how vain are all his schemes! But now, the leader of a gallant band; And now, condemn'd to ignominious death. Hard fate! perversely hard! to be cut off Just at the time when fortune was in reach. So when, thro' life, some favourite plan's pursued, With toil and perseverance down to age, Just as we hope to reap the fruit of all, In steps the fell anatomy, and breaks The bubble. Be it so! Since I must die, No dastard fear shall stain my honest fame. Enter Gaoler. Gaoler. A stranger, Sir, without desires to see you. Abr. A stranger! Who can it be? Gaoler. I know not; But he will speak, he says, to none but you. Abr. Admit him then. [Exit Gaoler.] Who can this stranger be? But here he comes. Enter Gaoler, and Bernardo in a chairman's coat. Abr. Whence, and what art thou? Bern. We are not alone. Abr. Leave us, honest friend. [Exit Gaoler. Well, what's your business now? and say, who art thou? Bern. Hast thou forgot me then? [Discovers himself. Abr. How's this? Bernardo? Welcome, thrice welcome, ever faithful friend! But say, what urgent business brought thee here? Death, instant death, attends discovery. Bern. Think'st thou that death, in whatsoever form, Could e'er detain Bernardo from his friend? Abr. Oh, generous man! too-generous Bernardo! Much, much I wanted to behold my friend; But still I fear, while danger hovers round thee. What fit return can thy unhappy chief E'er make for such fidelity as thine? Bern. Thou wrong'st me, Abrahamides, to think My friendship ever trod in interest's path. Abr. Ah! well I know thy uncorrupted faith. Yet, oh, my friendâ Bern. Why bursts that aching sigh? Abr. Tell me, Bernardo; is it fitting, he, Who, by the general voice of all the Flints, Was chosen chief, should be expos'd at Tyburn? And at the gallows die a shameful death? Bern. What means my gallant friend? Abr. Does this become Whom Tailors follow'd, and the Flints have lov'd? Bern. What's to be done? shall I attempt a rescue? Abr. No. If thou ever held'st me in thy heart, Revenge my fall! Bern. I would; but how for means? Abr. Thou may'st remember, in an happier hour I told thee of a plan to free us both From servitude. Bern. Thou didst; but these late broils Depriv'd me of the right. Abr. 'Tis true, they did. What dost thou think of me? Bern. As of a man I love and honour much. Abr. Ill should I deserve That character, if I could e'er permit My friend to lose th'advantage I can't share. Mark me! Bern. I will. Abr. Thou know'st, as well as I, How many thousands, gaily drest, in town, With aching hearts lament their dwindled purse. Bern. Know it? ay, well! Abr. Thou also know'st, my friend, What blistering bills those tyrant masters bring. Bern. Blistering indeed! and the complaint is now As general as just. Abr. Now could you contrive To undercharge them, as in other trades, Would you not thrive? Bern. Ay; but consider well The length of credit they are forc'd to give. Abr. I do: That plan you are not to pursue; Low be your price, and ready cash your terms! Bern. Ay, that may do. But how for capital? Abr. For that I have provided. Well you know, The Tailors' trade no ample fortune needs: Soon as the suit's bespoke, the cloth you buy; When made, deliver'd, and the cash is paid. Bern. I understand you. Yet some capital, Tho' small, is wanting for the workmens' pay. Abr. 'Tis true; nor shall you want. Bern. But where to gain; There lies the point. Abr. I'll tell thee. Well thou know'st Ere cruel fortune sunk me thus to earth, As chief, the box was ever at my nod: This trust of right to every chief belongs; And since a few short hours will close my fate, Some future chief must then supply my place; And who so fit as thou? Bern. Oh, generous chief! Thy partial friendship much o'er-rates my worth. But then, what envious rivals may opposeâ Abr. Oh, there are none that can deserve thy fears; The gallant leaders of the Eastern climes, Tho' brave in war, in policy unskill'd. Besides, I know they doubt, and turn their eyes On me to fix their choice; thou art the man: The public box supplies thy capital. But oh, my friend, remember, when you've reach'd This envied pinnacle of Tailors' greatness, Never to violate the public faith! On that firm base alone your power will stand: The account is monthly; ere that time returns, From the first profits you repay the box. Bern. By Heav'n this plan exceeds my utmost hopes! Yet, oh, my heart recoils, when I reflect My friend cannot enjoy the bright reward. Abr. Revenge is all the recompense I ask!â Here is the plan digested into form; [Gives a paper. The different price affix'd to different suits. In every paper quickly advertise; You'll soon have custom: Ere few years are past, You'll be establish'd firm in Fortune's track, And shake the tyrants' profit, drain their purses! For ready cash will bear you thro' the world. What says Bernardo? wilt thou advertise? Bern. In every paper, Morning, Weekly, Nightly, 'Till it shall run like wildfire thro' the land, Abr. Then Abrahamides contented dies!â Ye claret-drinking tyrants, ye shall feel me, E'en from the grave! Your children yet unborn Shall curse the day that injur'd Abrahamides! Bern. By Heav'n, they shall! and, to my latest hour, Thy wrongs shall in my memory live green! Abr. Thanks, my Bernardo.âOne word, and then farewell! I charge thee, by our present common danger, By our past friendship, by your future hopes, By all that can affect a generous Tailor, If you should have success, preserve from want The hapless Tittillinda! Oh, remember, Thy dying Abrahamides requests it! Bern. Oh, doubt it not! Should Fortune blast my hopes, By work, at least, I can preserve from want Thy hapless fair. Abr. Oh, thanks, thou generous friend! For ever, and for ever, now farewell! Bern. For ever, and for ever, oh, farewell, Thou first of friends, of heroes, and of Tailors! [Exit. Enter Christophorides, Humphryminos, BartholomÃ«us, and Jackides. Hum. Oh, gallant man, chief pillar of the Flints! Bart. Wapping will stand aghast, and Redriff mourn Thy lamentable fall! Abr. Cease your vain griefs! I won't forgive that friend who sheds one tear! As Abrahamides has ever liv'd, So is he now resolv'd to die, a Flint! Jack. Upon my shoul, he is a gallant fellow! Abr. I thank you for this last mark of your friendship; And now from each will take a last farewell. But some I miss! where is Isaacos? And where Bernardo? Chris. They are both proscrib'd, Therefore absconded.âIn this doubtful state, (When thou shalt be no more) we know not where To fix our choice; and therefore are we come To know, whom thou wilt name to fill thy place. Abr. The worthiest. Chris. Who can determine that? Abr. Your own free choice. Hum. That will be doubtful still, Where merit's equal; and your voice alone Will put an end to every private claim. Abr. Consider well the task which you impose: Where all are worthy of the name of Flints, Whom can I name, but I affront the rest? Bart. Oh, no! so much we rest upon your truth, Your honesty, that we're determin'd all, Both to obey, and to support, the chief Whom you shall recommend. Abr. 'Tis a hard task! Yet, ere I speak, answer what I demand. Omnes. We will. Abr. Have I e'er swerv'd from duty, or from honour? Hum. Oh, no. Abr. Say, have I e'er deceiv'd you? Chris. No. Abr. Has private friendship ever bias'd me? Bart. No. Abr. Have I e'er violated public faith? Or with rapacious hand e'er wrong'd the box? Hum. Oh, no: And therefore do we want thy voice, To nominate a chief. Abr. Fain would I wave This last hard task! What think you of Bernardo? Omnes. It is enough.âBernardo be the man! Long live Bernardo! he's our future guide. Abr. And now, my friends, take each a last farewell.â But, oh, remember! never let the Flints Sink to base slavery! Tho' now oppress'd, In happier days they yet may rise again. In the mean time, with utmost industry, Use every art to gall the tyrant masters! Bart. We will.âBut, oh, brave chief, we grieve to find The last sepulchral honours are denied thee: No friend can with to close thy dying eyes, Or lay thy clay-cold corse in hallow'd earth! Jack. What, are the slaying rascals then to have him? Bart. Too sure, they must. Jack. De'el burn me, if they shall! There's little Phalim, I, and all my boys, Will rescue him from out their butchering hands. Abr. Let them then do their worst; for wheresoe'er One bone of Abrahamides shall hang, Knowâthere still Abrahamides shall awe them! Hum. Oh, gallant chief! worthy an happier fate! For ever, now, we take our last farewell. Abr. Live and be happy, and farewell for ever! [Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter Abr. Enter Tittillinda. Titt. Stand off! hold off your hands! 'tis all in vain! See him I must.âOh, Abrahamides! Abr. Ah, Tittillinda! wherefore art thou come? Titt. Unkindly said! Canst thou deny me then Once more to see, once more within my arms To press thee closeâere yet we part for ever? Abr. Mistake me not! still art thou rooted here!â Check those sad tears, lest they unman me too. Titt. Have I not cause? when thou art gone for ever, Oh, where shall hapless Tittillinda go? No friend to soothe her sorrows, share her grief, Or shield her from unfeeling bailiffs' hands! Abr. Oh, cease; nor with vain fears disturb thy breast; Thy Abrahamides has taken care At least from want to save his Tittillinda. My friend Bernardo, when from danger free, Has power and will to serve thee. Titt. What of that? What power, what will, can ever make me blest?â Since thou wert taken, sleep has fled my eyes: Last night, I had a mack'rel for my supper, But ah, whilst thou wert absent, could not eat. Thus will it be, on each succeeding day; At breakfast, dinner, supper, shall I miss thee! Abr. Oh, cease, my love; nor with these fruitless tears Lament in vain what cannot be redress'd! But since each moment I expect my fate, Oh, let me be prepar'd. Say, hast thou brought The linen with thee? Titt. I had quite forgot. Here is the cap; and here the shirt; a ruffled one. But, oh, what change has cruel Fortune made! What pleasing thoughts amus'd me while 'twas mending! I fondly hop'd, but, ah, I hop'd in vain, This ruffled shirt had been thy Sunday's shirt, And not a winding-sheet to shade thy corse. Abr. Thanks to my love, for this last generous care!â Undaunted, now, I will my fate defy! Since I shall soon with kings and princes lie, I with this shirt will make a shift to die. [Exit. [Tittillinda faints. Enter Gaoler. Gaoler. From these sad scenes this certain truth you'll draw, Great is the danger to offend the law; Since nor his conduct, bravery, nor truth, Could from the gallows save the Tailor youth. THE END.</field>
