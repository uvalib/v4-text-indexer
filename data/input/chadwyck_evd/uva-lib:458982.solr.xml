Although your sonne has pleasd To call me friend, I finde he has reservd Something he wod not credit to my bosome; I have observ'd his trouble, but unwilling By moving questions to renew his sufferings: If my particular knowledge of his fate May be no prejudice, tho it be without My verge to serve him, I can willingly Share in their griefe that love him. Mer. You speake nobly, Twas his misfortune Sir provok'd to kill A Gentleman, brother to Vrsini, who Was favorite to the Duke deceasd, and now Grac'd by the Dutchesse, by whose power he may Command him dead, these summons I suspect; But take my counsell Borgia, and deceive His expectation of revenge, once more He bids thee flie; would slay thee in his heart, Let me runne their displeasure. Au. Not for me Sir, I am resolv'd, 'tis better dye at home, Then wast my life an exile, Ile to Court we'e. Pis. Y'are not mad. Au. Thou art a foole, cannot I cast Borgias skin off when I please, I must See my faire sister at a minuts warning, Thou art evidence for me; father I waite you, My sisters there you say, doe not doubt me; At worst, Ile have a tricke to keepe my head on: Come friend and Gentlemen. Iu. We attend. Exit. Enter Dutchesse, Ursini, Cornelia, Melinda, Laura. Du. You have prevail'd Vrsini: yet we thought Of all men living you would least have beene A sutor for his pardon, but tis sign'd He owes you for his life. Vrs. Your mercy rather, I have consider'd madam I did lose A brother, whose repaire I shall not finde Now in anothers blood, the Gentleman Hath suffer'd, though not what the Lawes determine. Many yeares pennance, so severe, perhaps That he is come by offering himselfe now A sacrifice to your justice, to prevent A death more killing, still to live a stranger To his owne friends and countrey. Du. If your charitie Extend so farre, the rest we have dispenc'd with, He is return'd for certaine? he is either Wearie of life, or master of a confidence That might have beene his ruine. Vrs. This will make Your art of mercy shine the brighter Madam. Du. It will, but let me aske you good my Lord, Does this proceede out of a cleare forgivenesse: Time I allow may qualifie the thought Of our revenge, and something else of pittie May so take off the roughnesse of our soule That we may have a noble charitie To our enemy, but has your end no mixture Of something else, that may advance a hope To satisfie desire some other way? No turne to profit or delight? be plaine For I must know your brest. Vrs. You shall see through me, I dare not weare a thought lesse than transparent, I love his sister Madam, faire Cornelia With those intents become me, in that flame I sacrifice all thoughts that wound her brother And wish no happy satisfaction, And by that charme of her consent to love My brother is redevind in Borgia. Dut. Y'are briefe, yet plaine; how point Cornelias Affections. Vrs. I have wooed her but in complement, And tho there may be sonnes to admit My services, I finde she is all obedience To her father, whom the apprehension Of his sonnes fortune may have indisposd To a present reconcilement. Dut. This one act Will make him kinde, and forme him to your wishes. Vrs. If they might have the happinesse to be Propounded by your highnesse to Mercutio, I prophesie successe, pardon great Madam, If after all your princely favors I Begge this with many blushes, love is grac'd By dwelling on your breath. Dut. Ursini since The Duke dyed you have found no losse in our Esteeme, to his ashes I have paid that dutie To grace whom he affected, and be confident We shall not deny this, is he not come yet? Urs. He will attend your graceâwho waits. Enter Pietro. Pie. Signior Mercutio Expects your graces pleasure, with him his sonne Borgia Cor. My brother. Dut. Tho we pardon him We must put on a brow of some displeasure And chide his fault, he may be encourag'd else To a second insolence. Urs. Gently I beseech you, There may be a punishment within your eye To kill him, and so make the benefit Is meant him, of no vertue, or to himselfe, Or my designe. Dut. How is the name of gentleman Dishonor'd by such desperate undertakings; That more then guiltie of humane blood, doe kill Even Charity. Enter Mecutio, Borgia, Pisauro. Urs. Th'are admitted. Dut. Is that he? We sent for you Mercutio to tell you How much you owe to good Ursinis love, At whose earnest solicite we have sign'd Young Borgias pardon, if you examine well; You will have cause to place him in the first Ranke of your friends. Mer. Shall I beleeve my eyes, My understanding? how is Mercutio blest? Looke boy the pardon, heaven reward thy charities; My Lord for saving one, command the lives Of all our family, thou soule of honour; Looke Borgia. Pis. What de'e meane Kneele to the Dutchesse, and acknowledge. Bor. What. Pis. A pardon for your life. Bor. I am lost here Pisauro, an excellent creature. Pis. You'l spoile all, Shee's yet your sister, I doe like her too; Kneele for your pardon, and you may choose your gallowes In time, wood I were hanged on no worse peece Of timper, how nimbly would I climbe the Ladder, Ha you no sence? humble your knees to thanke Her highnesse and that gentleman. Du. Why does That fellow kneele Ursini. Urs. 'Tis Signior Borgia, His heart is full of thankes. Du. I looke not for em, What doe I feele? command him rise. Urs. Deare Madam. Looke calme upon him.

How do you meane my Lord. Pis. Now hee's put toot, she is Ursinis mistresse. As he is Borgia, he can have no Pretence to oppose him, if he discover And be Aurelio agen, he destroyes all Hope for himselfe, for I perceive hee's taken with her I know by the motion of his nose, which pants Like the Bellowes of an Organ. Urs. Sir your fathers Voyce speakes in yours, you now command my destinie If you will make me happy. Bo. Noble Sir, I am sorry where such infinite merits plead I have no power to serve your noble wishes, And keepe the honour of a gentleman. Urs.

The pleasures of the Court will so abate His thoughts this way, that I presume your Lordship Will soone be master of that amorous province You ayme at, and much honour your poore servants. Urs. Let this confirme I am yours. Pis. So so, this was indifferently well carried, I was jealous Of a more lame come off. Urs. Adde this one To your other princely favours Madam, and Admit this gentleman to kisse your hand. Dut. Without much suite my heart woule have conveyd That to my lip, a very handsome gentleman. Cor. What sayd the Dutchesse? doe not her eyes fix Upon my brother? how now Cornelia, I am his sisters sister, yet I had No acquaintance with this turbulent passions When I last saw him. Mer. What does her highnesse meane, She speakes to Ursini, but her eye directs Some language this way, Borgia dost observe? Bo. And wonder, but I see nothing in her eyes To be afraid of. Pis. If the Dutchesse should be in love with him Here were a purchase, I doe verily Beleeve here will be an end of all our warres, If he have but the grace to march upon This service and charge home, smiles, smiles upon him Well Aurelio Andreozzi, tis very possible You may meete with your match if he mount her, Ile bring a Ladder to his sisters fort And then the town's our owne, she calls him to her.

She plaies with him, good, better, I, is your spirit up my nimble Dutchesse, Would I had the conjuring of it downe, Vrsini Lookes like a whelpe had lost his taile alreadie. Urs. I was jealous she would chide and frowne upon him, praid her be gentle, and looke calme, Ist come To this. Du.

I have heard of charmes and philters. Iu. If travell have these glorious effects Ile abroad too. Lu. He has a hansome person. Iu. And discourses grant it. Lu. Is master of a noble soule. Iu. Soule, nay let that alone, Ladies doe not looke After the soule so much, the body will serve their Turne, so it be nimble, and at their devotion, If you observe, he is grac'd by all the Ladies As if he were their generall minion, I doe not like his sisters eyes upon him, They whirle too much and seem'd to shoot an envie Vpon the Dutchesse favors. Lu. I am confident Thou hast no murmer in thy thoughts against him. Iu. I but expresse my wonder, In that I thinke the whole Court had a share: He knowes I love him, twill become his feare How to secure Ursini. Lu. He preferd him First to her highnesse. Iu. Not with expectation To be supplanted, I make question If the humor hold, whether shee may not marry him, That's a round higher then her favorite: Had hope to climbe. Lu. Although I honour Borgia And wish him heartily advanc'd, I wod not Kneele to him, my voyce is for Ferrara He is a Prince, I wod not for my state This shod breake off his treatie. Iu.

My Lord let me Prevaile so farre, I hope you imagine I Am firme to you, I have more cause to be Impatient, my whole strength at Court's concernd, But have more noble thoughts then to suspect You can be slighted, thinke tis but a dreame Injustice to your cause, and royall master Put on no face of discontent, returne And see how things will close Fer. 'Tis an affront Bove satisfaction, but the disgrace Reflects beyond my person. Urs. Had she studied Honours to his ambition, it had Not wrong'd her prudence, to have shewne you more Respect. Fer. But I was not considerable; The young Gentleman had taken up her eyes, Her tongue, her feete, her understanding too, I might have witherd in my seate, no beame, No discourse this way, but that once she was pleasd To aske me how I lik'd the gallants dancing, Ile not disturbe her revels. Urs. Yet my Lord Have so much fortitude, 'twill be a meanes If you returne, to make her finde her errour To your person, were she not my Princesse I should professe my selfe asham'd, but come Let me beseech you to goe backe, leave not The presence so, for your owne honour Sir Observe a little more, I hope you shannot Repent my counsell.

They doe resent it, and for ought I heare Have little hope to mend it. Lu. Can she be In love so soone, well Borgia, if this Hold, Ile applaud thy fate. Iu. For after this Allowance, hee'l be Duke of Urbin to morrow, Give thee joy bully, let me see if he Turne Prince, tis best for us turne beggers. Lu. Beggers? Iu. Court beggers, Hee'l deny us nothing, Now for some witty knave to finde out suits, I must keepe some in pension for that purpose, They are profitable vermine, Enter Pisauro. His companion. Pis. Save you Gentlemen, what de'e meane? Why stand yee bare? Lu. In being Borgias friend It will become us. Iu. He knowes no title yet, But chiefe secretary to her highnesse, what honours Are in her brest laid up for him, we know not He has a mounting fate, and in his we Pronounce you happy. Pis. We shall all be Princes In time; but Gentlemen lets be more familiar We thinke so well of things, does he preserve The Dutchesse smile, or does she use to make At some time o' the Moone sport with her subjects. Iu. You are wide all the heaven Sir, had you come A little sooner you had heard discourse. Enter Borgia. To cleare your doubt, hee's here himselfe. Bo. Pisauro, What will become on's, tis as thou saist? Pis. What prethee? Bo. The Dutchesse is mad. Pis. How! Bor. Why she is certainly in love, shat in and see How I am us'd, and yet I now come forth To recover breath, I ha danc'd my selfe to a jellie, The Ladies ha no mercy; but the Dutchesse Pis. What prethee. Bo. Is as I told thee mad, I prethee counsell me Altho her grace be pleasd to shew me favors 'Twere boldnesse to beleeve, and thanke her. Pis. How? I hope thou art not mad. Bo. I know not whether The fit will last, I may hold some proportion With Cornelia, my suppos'd sister, she Poore wretch does cast such speaking eyes upon me As she were Iealous of the Dutchesse too, And wrings me by the hand when I dance with her. Enter Pietro. Pie. The Dutchesse Sir calls for you. Bo. I attend; What were I best to doe? Pis. Dost make a question Lose not the fortune that's presented in The Dutchesse love, thy starres ordaind thee for her; Ile make a shift with Cornelia, looke high And prosper, when th'art a Duke, I say no more Bo. What shall's doe with Pimponio? that foole May betray all. Pis. He is a Prince before you I ha made him sure, and swolne him into a pride, He shall not know you, but of that hereafter, Away and please the Dutchesse. Enter Dutchesse, Ladies, Ferrara, Ursini. Bo. Your graces pardon? Du. 'Tis late, good night my Lord Embassador. Exit. Fer. 'Tis well I am bid goodnight, yet all my hopes Vanish in mists, what thinke you now cosin? Urs. I know not what to thinke, let me waite on you To your lodgings. Fer. They joyne toth' Court. Urs. 'Tis the lesse service. Fer. To morrow morning if I may be honor'd With your presence, I will impart a secret to yon, And be happy in your Counsell. Urs. I obey Any commands. Fer. For this time give me pardon, goodnight my Lord. Ex. Urs. A happy night to your Lordship, After so many yeares spent in the Court, I am to learne the tricke on't, these are actions Gainst my first rules, I am ignorant Of this new Court philosophy, what should The Dutchesse meane, so prodigall of her graces To one she scarse remembers, with such open Neglect to th' Dukes' Embassador? I was carefull She wod not use him kindely enough, wert not Affection to his sister, lyes up my Revenge, Ide drop it on his heart, but I Must worke with art, and by a Counter magicke Dissolve his spell, or forme him to my purpose. Enter Laura and Melinda. You have beene waiting on the Dutchesse Ladies? Lau. She dismis'd us. Urs. With what circumstance? Is she still pleasant? Mel. Strangely altered Since young Borgia tooke his leave and melancholly: Well, I suspectâ Vrs. What Madam? Mel. Sheele scarse sleepe To night, for dreaming oth' Gentleman. Vrs. He is gone then? Lau. Yes, we saw his departure my Lord, He kist us both, but we put forward first, He is the hansomst Gentleman; dee thinke He weares his owne haire? Mil. I was about To aske him once, but thought he was modest And wod ha blushd, I wod I had his picture. Urs. His substance Madam, but take heede, the Dutchesse Must have no rivall, how dee affect his talke? Lau. That was not my part to observe, we did divide Our Provences, each Lady tooke a member To examine, when we have conferd our notes Ile tell yee what the body of Ladies thinke on him. Mel. Nay wee'l take him a peeces e're we ha done. Urs. And who shall set him together agen? my Ladies I waite on you. Lau. Your Lordship will too much honour us. Urs. 'Tis the way to my owne lodging. Mel. If it were not the way my Lord, your Lordship Could not be destitute of a lodging at Court. Urs. Your Charitie would releeve me, use my service. Exit. Enter Ferrara and Pietro with a light. Fer. There is no such affliction to the soule As that which should preserve it, love, a passion That with consent betrayes our understanding, And leaves man but a heape of flame and ruins; I was safe till I had seene her, busie fame Tooke but possession of my eare, my owne Rashnesse and vanitie engagd my person To see what was commended, and I suffer for't, Leave me. Pie. Tis darke my Lord. Fer. Thou ly'st, tis light And by these fires I see too much, away, I shall soone reach my lodgings, night and I Shall agree well together, if my stay Be long, remember that you left me under The pallace windowes, leave to be officious And obey meâtill this night she gave me faire Exit. Respect, and seem'd to allow the loving treatie, I was dull not to uncloud me all this while The knowledge of my person had engagd her Beside my act of love, and so much confidence Past all retreate, and yet she is a woman, Whose nature is unsteady as the waves, Vpon which foolish man runnes desperate To me a ruine. Enter Borgia. Bor. Fortune thou smilst too much, I shall suspect Thy giddinesse, take eyes to thee and see To what a flattering height thou hast exalted A credulous man. Fer. What voice is that, it had A sound of melancholy, darkenesse secure me. Bor. But why make I ridiculous application To fortune? love is onely active here; The tyrant love, more blinde then chance, I am Full of distraction, there's a labyrinth Within, and more I tread, the more I am lost Betwixt the Dutchesse and Cornelia My soule divids, I must not be a foole, And for the fable of amorous love Leave state that courts me with a glorious title, And yet Cornelia is fury, and lookes Withall the charmes of love upon her brow, What will she doe when she beleeves I am No brother? Fer. Tis the new ague Borgia That shakes the court, how confidently he talkes To himselfe, a light strikes from the Dutchesse window And mucsike; Ile observe, the gallant may Have some appointment. Song. Cornelia above. Bo. Alas poore love-sicke Lady, what if I Attempted farther, the excuse will fall More easie on a stranger, Lady, hist. Cor. Whoe's that? Bo. One that does wish the happinesse To see your face, you have blest my eares already. Cor. What are you? Bo. My name's Borgia, if you be A faire one of the court, time is not old Since I was a guest there. Cor. 'Tis he, Ile not lose This opportunitie, Sir your boldnesse Speakes you a stranger, and in part excuses You are alone. Bo. I am. Cor. I expect not Vpon so small acquaintance you should know My voyce agen, I am the Dutchesse Sir. Bo. Your graces humble creature, may I hope You'l pardon this attempt. Cor. Vpon condition You will forget the freedome of our nature And not grow insolent upon our favours, We were late pleas'd to shew you, 'twas not love But mirth, we meant our court the wantonnesse Of reveling nights, which we upon retirements Know how to checke and punnish too in men, That dare licentiously apply to our Dishonour: if your service in that place Of secretary we have nam'd you for Be diligent and faithfull, we repent not That choise, but on your life feede no ambition Higher, it will be a degree next treason To us, and the honour of Ferrara's Duke, With whom because you are our secretary We let you know our thoughts are fixt to marry, Fer. What blessing hath my eare tooke in? she is Resolv'd to my desires. Cor. Are you gone Sir? Sleepe wisely if you can, we shall expect Your attendance in the morning, but no thought On forfeit of your life beyond whats dutie. Fer. I have enough to morrow I resolve To be my selfe, and with a state becomming Ferraras Duke, challenge this happinesse, Forgive deare Princesse I suspected thee. Exit. Enter Dutchesse above. Cor. The Dutchesse shee'l spoyle all. Dut. I heard your voyce more loud then usuall, Whom spake you to? Cor. Heer's no body and please your grace. Dut. You hold some dialogue at the window then, Ile know. Cor. My brother Borgia Madam. Dut. Borgia, leave us. Cor. I hope hee's gone. Bo. I must confesse you are my Princesse Madam, To whose least command I owe my blood and fortune. Dut. He speaks to me, how does he know I am here? Bo. And doe not thinke I can be lost so much In dutie to interpret there was any thing In me, that could deserve more then your pastime; And let me fall and dye beneath your anger, When I transgresse so farre, as to forget My humble fate which onely can be blest With my obedience to you, I had not One sawcie application of your favours, My heart shall bleed to death ere it shall finde One thought of so much impudence. Dut. Howes this? Since Cornelia has usurped my name And frighted him, what should make her officious He is her brother, I must heare no more Of thisâyou are mistaken all this while, I am Cornelia your sister. Bo. Is the Dutchesse gone? Dut. You well distinguish voyces, yet shee's gone. Bo. My joy of soule, deerest Cornelia. Tis she that I must trust to. Du. I'st e'en so? Deare brother, leaving all your studied complements I doe not like your dilatory reasons To Ursini, I may heare you as a brother, But must not trouble you to choose my husband; It is the Dutchesse pleasure, I should marry Ursini, an advancement more then I Can hope, from your election of a stranger And set your heart at rest, how ere I seem'd Inclining, destinie is not more fixt, Then the affection I owe Ursini, Him I resolve to marry, and before The next daies light is wasted. Bo. I am undone A'both sides, heare me yet but speake. Dut. What would you say brother? Bo. I am not thy brother. Dut. How, not Borgia. Bo. Not Borgia, the whole towne's mistaken My name is Aurelio Andreozzi, I was borne in Millan, with my friend design'd To see some service in the German warres; At the first sight I must confesse I lov'd thee: To enjoy thy conversation more freely, I was content to seeme what men would call me Dut. You tell me wonders. Bo. I can give thee proofe, But to no purpose now, and tell thee too Enough to make thee thinke I may be worthy, But since 'tis so, I am glad you ha' discover'd Your resolution so soone, good night te'e, Ile make no noyse to morrow, when I take My journey. Dut. Stay, he must not be so lost, This is a strange discovery, if you can Bring testimony that you are not Borgia, You shall not Sir repent your comming hither, Nor yet despaire of any noble wayes That may reward your good opinion, Tis late; a lovers dreame charme all your senses, And waking finde your wishes, if you please Vntill I aske a further satisfaction, Be still conceal'd. Exit. Bo. There may be hope, although My first love I confesse reflect on this, The Dutchesse yet, had not beene much amisse. Exit.</field>

Defend allegiance, Gentlemen mistake not Altho I love my sonne, Ile not be guiltie Of any thought to crosse her, but I should Be sorry he should cast away himselfe. Iu. How de'e meane? Mer.

There have beene Presidents to make it seeme no wonder. Mer. She had better taine his head off, there had ended My cares, the boy t'runne madde, and what can follow Thinke yee? goe to, Ile to her highnesse presently. Iu. What to doe? Mer. To pray her leave him to a naturall death, And choose some other to undoe with pride Of her large favours; gentlemen examine But your selves, could either of you two promise To keepe your wits, if such a grace were offerd To you? would it not tempt you to be mad, To thinke of being a Duke? speake honestly, I'st fit indeed you should be lesse than mad? There be some men ith' world ha' lost their senses When they but chewd the Cud of a bare Lordship, I ha' knowne a knighthood has turn'd some mens wits, The very noyse o'th spurres; then doe not blame me If I desire my sonne sober and sensible, And now I thinke on't Ile first seeke him out.

I was more fortunate Then I have reason for, and yet my country And friends were pretious madam, nor could life In such a wildernesse abroad, where none Durst owne me, be a benifit; there was A bessing in my fate to meete your mercy That gave me boldnesse. Dut. Cunningly dissembled, You met no Lady then in all your travell, I meane none whom you cald mistresse, with Her loving magicke to lay charmes upon you And forc'd your stay. Bo. None Madam, I was not Worth any Ladies thought, none were so lost To their owne Iudgements to imagine me More then a walking shaddow, or if any Had cherish'd better thought of me a stranger, They quickly found, they had not plac'd it right, On so much barrennesse which left their charity To pay it selfe. Dut. You doe not promise such A hard and horrid composition, But love may finde a shift to enter more Then skinne deepe in your bosome, but perhaps You left your heart at home, and could not then Dispence with new ingagements, it was so, And for her sake you willingly forgot Your danger to returne, nay be not troubled, Confession will not injure you, I like You should preferre the beauties of your country. Bo. It Cannot be thought flattery, if I Acknowledge with the narrowest observation My eyes could take, no place hath beene more fruitfull In beautie then your owne, and it doth hold Proportion with your excellence, all should Be faire and imitate your first example. Dut. I see you can be when you list a Courtier, But this confirmes your love is planted here; And since we are falne by accident upon This subject, wee'l pursui't a little further; Come I must know your Mistris, doe not doubt I shall disturbe the progresse of your loves. Bor. What answer shall I frame, things are not ripe Yet for discovery, so please your highnesse You would be modest, and excuse, be wiser And apprehend my meaning to advance Your wishes, tis within my power to effect As much as your ambition can ayme at: Who is it if her heart be stubborne, we Can make it soft; if great above your fortune, We can raise you to her equality, Or bring her downe to your levell, since we ha' promist In hope not to repent: either declare The mistresse of your thoughts, and finde them prosper, We are not us'd to expresse such bounteous language, But be she proudest, greatest in our Dutchy, Without all limitation, she shall carry No birth or state here, to despise the service You fairely meane her: if we faile in this, We will not thinke our strength worth the preserving Bo. If I have any wit. Enter Cornelio. Cor. Madam the Duke. Dut. What Duke? Cor. The Duke of Ferrara with a glorious traine Is come to Court, and as the loud voyce is Given out by himselfe, to claime you for his wife, For which he has your promise. Dut. How our promise? Can Princes be so insolent, beshrew His haste, but we shall lose much of our honour To give no ceremony to his person? How e're our thoughts point, we will entertaine him And dresse our face in smiles. Cor. His lookes renew My sufferings, I have not power to manage My wilde affection, my heart will not Be denied but by a secret destinie. Runnes to imbrace him âBrother. Dut. Ha, Cornelia I hope you are not courting Borgia, He is your brother, know your place within Our traine. Exit. Bo. Shee's jealous, jealous, starres I thanke you, Tis cleare as light shee does affect me now: Did she not put me too't, to name my mistris, Yet in a shaddow pointed at her selfe? Be she the proudest, greatest in our Dutchy Without all limitation, I mark'd that And had my senseâif great above your fortune We can raise you to her equalitie: Fine moralls, poore Cornelia loves me too, But I must give her no encouragement: Her grace is much the better womanâha. Loud Musicke. A passage over the Stage, Duke, Dutchesse, Ursini, Iulio, Lucio, Pietro, Ladies. She appeard discontent when first Cornelia Brought her the newes, yet they march lovingly Together, but that ceremony must Be allow'd at Court, where shift of face and tongue Are wisely to be practiz'dâmy good Lord. Enter Ursini and Pietro. Urs. Your servant Borgia. Tis her graces pleasure every gentleman That has relation to the Duke, taste all The bounties of her Court. Bo. How's this? Urs. None dare To affront a Groome on forfeit of his place, Let all the offices of entertainment Be free and open. Pie. I shall signifie These her commands. Urs. And they that of her owne Court are ambitious to expresse their duties Let it appeare in keeping this day solemne To wine and mirth, that every brow may speake A joy and welcome to the Duke. Pie. I shall. Exit. Bo. Here's like to be a triumph, with your Lordships Pardon; was that the Duke of Ferrara, Urs. Yes of Urbin shortly, when their marriage Is perfect, every subjects heart prayes for it, And sent their acclamations to heaven To see her highnesse lovingly salute him, Hee's a brave Prince. Bo. A good round gentleman, He did not flie hither; I heard talke of an Embassadour. Urs. A cloud for his owne person Till his affaires came to maturitie, He stood conceal'd toth' Dutchesse, but last night He gain'd her princely word to marry him, And is this morning bright in his owne glories. Bo. Last night. Urs. Ile build more faith upon his honour Fast as a contract. Bo. To what painted Paradise Would she ha' led me? wood I had my sister now. Urs. With this joy I had forgot my owne, Borgia; Brother Let not the sound be unwelcome, tis the Dutchesses Pleasure to honour her unworthy creature Ursini, by appointment of our marriage To Waite on hers. Bo. What marriage? Urs. With your sister, Ile not suspect your love, since faire Cornelia Is not displeasd to be directed by Her highnesse, and be confident my love Shall make the memory of it welcome to you; You will excuse me if I take my leave, These houres are full of businesse, and I have Many commands upon me. Exit. Bo. In good time, I am in a good state agen, I was an asse To thinke the Dutchesse meant me any thing But mockery, she told me so before To make more sport, I ha' lost my sister too, Shees for Ursinis carving, I could curse My selfe to Millan, but tis not impossible I may retrive Cornelia, by giving her A timely satisfaction, I am not Her brother Borgia: Ther's all the hope is left, I shall be loath To hunt two hares, and after lose them both.

Hee's proud, he wonnot know me: 'Tis so, hee's lost, he is undone, nay, nay, It will become me to stand bare to you Sir, And teach my hammes the officious cringe; be cover'd. Bo. I know not how to interpret Sir your language; Yet I would hope you mocke me not, altho It was the Dutchesse pleasure to create Mirth from this barren heape, and counterfeit Favors to try my duty, joyne not you With others to enlarge my scorne, I am not So tame of soule, but I have sense of all Their Ieeres. Mer. Their Ieeres? whom doe you point upon? Bo. I dare not name the Dutchesse; I am all Obedience to her person, yet she might Have plac'd her giddy humor somewhere else It swells not me with expectation, I was not made for state. Mer. Doe not you then Thinke to be Duke. Bo. Should any but your selfe Name such a title to me, I should answer His question with a frowne, and something else To waite upon't, tho I engag'd my life To a fresh danger, but I am instructed By nature and religion to be calme At what you say. Mer. On this condition Ile give thee leave to beate me, 'twas my feare Thou hadst an easie faith, and wert transported Indeede out of thy wits, but since I see Thou art not madde, I will commend a wife to thee.

Good Madam Render me not so lost to my owne senses, To the honour of a Prince basely to coine A language for my purpose, though you may Repent the last nights freedome, and correct Your judgement of me, make me not so miserable To let the Court thinke I invented this As destitute of nobler wayes to move you, But I presume this is to try my patience And make my joyes at last more pretious By this delay; I know you are all vertue And cannot staine your selfe by a denyall Of any syllable you speake. Dut. With pardon Of your grace, I shall laugh if you persist thus: You had a pleasant dreame, but lovers Are flatterd in their sleepe, I speake to you. Fer.

Witnesse There is too much at stake my Lord already, To racke this argument for your owne fame, Proceede not to enlarge it, we would rather Confesse some guilt against our selfe, then let You honour be expos'd to such strait censure For loving us, yet if you would be silent In this we shall be proud, in other things To have denyed you nothing, and be asham'd You tooke our Court so unprepard to honour you.

It seemes you have concluded, Madam, I Must be the generall mirth. Dut. I finde Cornelias Cunning in this, and must apply some complement For our owne honour, good my Lord your privacie. Bo. How er'e her grace be a little impudent I had beene madde to justifie the Duke In such a cause, she has no minde to marry him, And perhaps talk'd to me last night to try My strength of wit, women are subtill creatures, No matter tho Ursini court my sister, My ambitions faire a tother side agen.

Have we no more distinction in our birth And titles? Or de'e hope we are disarm'd Of strength to punish such an insolence? Had smiles tane such possession of our brow Thou couldst expect no killing frowne for this? Was our eye growne so tame nothing could quicken it Into a flame, into a consuming lightning, When such an object durst appeare to vex it? Thus we could spurne thy sawcy head offâbut We pardon it, de'e heare? we freely pardon it, To shew mercy is above all fault, And that we are at home Queene of our passions, Nor shall you suffer under the remembrance, Tis now as it had never beene, and you keepe The first place in our thoughts.

I love you Sir, &amp;c. tis a letter, and I wrote it, To whom, to him that loves her best, if none love her better, Tis to my selfe? Why am I so scrupulous? She has made me Chancellor in the cause, There's noe particular nam'd, yet she was angry, Yet she was pleasd agen, and had my crime Beene greater, she had met it charitably. Come I perceive the whole device as sure As I have any sense, she does affect me, And tries me at the last weapon of wit How Ile behave my selfe, are you there Dutchesse; She is my owne, and this invites me to The close of all my happinesse, if I Forfeit this opportunitie, let Midas Transplant his goodly eares to this dull head, And let all women laugh at me, my starres I bow to you, and kisse your influence, I am exalted to your spheare already, Where, with the Dutchesse I will fit and shine A constellation.

Duke of Ferrara. Fer. So, was't your plot to bring That puppet to affront me 'fore the Dutchesse? Was there noe other name to be usurp'd, Dishonor'd, and prophan'd by hounds and monkies But mine? Bo. I understand you not, your anger Is not directed right my Lord, I am not Guiltie in thought. Fer. Your feares shall not excuse. Bo. You are abus'd. Fer. I know I am Sir, and Will print revenge upon your heart, 'tshall carry The character of a villaine. Bo. I must tell you Duke. Fer. What Sir? Bo. Were you master of the world, Could you shoot death beyond a Basiliske, Or had you mischiefe in your breath above The Lernean vapours, or the killing steame Of the hot lake that poysons innocent Birds But daring to flie over, I would rise With as much confidence to scorne this calumnie As I would quench my thirst, or chide my Groome The drudges for me, Duke I am no villaine, And tho my blood runnes not so deepe a purple There's no corruption in the chapest veine My Liver feeds, 'tis cleare and honest sir, In thy owne Court Ile meet and tell thee so Mauger thy guards, and gawdy Butter-flies, I dare, by innocence, I dare. Fer. You thinke The place protects you now. Bo. Were it in a Church No drop of mine could staine it, Duke I cannot Feare and be master of a sword, that needs No valour in a cause so just as mine To stirre the point, by all my hopes. Fer. Thy hopes, Of what reversion? what Groomes place is vacant? Bo. Come tis not done becommingly To insult because you have a priviledge Of Duke above you, I am here a servant To a most gracious Princesse. Fer. At that name I drew New flame, and should I credit thy soule free From this dishonour, thou hast sinne enough In thy ambition to pull ruine on thee, Are we too fit to be in competition Sir? Hast thou a thought so proud, so daring in thee To be my rivall? Have I courted her To her owne height, a Prince? and shall her vassall Looke on her with an eye, lesse then serves The Altar with, because she is pleasd some time To laugh, and seeme indulgent to your services For her owne sake, can you have braine to thinke Such treason to her judgement, that she loves you? Or can she be so lost to truth and honour Not to make good her promises to me Religious as a contract, has she not Declard me worthy of her, and my love The best of all the world. Bo. How was that Sir? Fer. The best of all the world, tis not that I Can be so poore in my esteeme of her Whose mention is sacred, or my selfe That I have any jealousie thou canst Inherit possibly the hundredth part Of any thought that points upon affection Hast thou no soule to apprehend thy scorne? Nay did she not, fearing thou might'st grow insolent Vpon her favours late declare herselfe, It was not love but mirth and wantonnesse Of revelling nights, commanding on thy life Thou feede no ambition higher, or feede a thought To her, beyond what waited upon dutie You may remember this. Bo. Tis cleare, this none Could tell him but her selfe, I finde too plaine Who is the may-game of the Court, this last Convinces me, your pardon mightie Sir You love the Dutchesse. Fer. Best she will acknowledge Of all mankind. Bo. I have a letter to you, I will not doubt my pardon when you reade it, Tis to you Sir if there can bee a joy beyond what's there contain'd Fer. Ha? I am blest, Borgia let me imbrace thee my best friend Dwell in my heart, divide with me Ferrara Or Urbin, any thing but the Dutchesse, say Ile meet her in the Garden were it walld With flaming Dragons, I have not a soule Spacious enough to entertaine this happinesse Beyond my hope, above my life deare Borgia. Exit. Bo. Beyond his hope? it seemes this joy was not Expected umph, and I had no commission To give it him, after all this if shee Meant it not this way, I ha' made fine worke, She might ha' namd him, wud I had the paper Agen, now doe I prophesie I have Vndone my selfe, and onely her grace meant That I should meet her, curse upon my easinesse; I have lost an opportunitie, no fate Flatterd a mortall with the like, dull braines, There's yet prevention, genius I thanke thee, Tis possible I may secure the Garden And boldly meet her first, if any destinie Owe me this blessing with this art I may Redeeme my folly, never man but I Wud lose so rich an opportunitie.

Mer. Are you Borgia. Bor. There's death in these delayes, doe not you know me? Or dare you not beleeve what I affirme Touching the Dutchesse. Mer. I beleeve you are Borgia to my griefe, and doe beleeve What you have said; her grace did appoint me To waite here, and commanded I should give Accesse to none but Borgia, de'e marke? She was pleasd to tell me, she had businesse onely Concern'd your knowledge, I dispute not what, But 'tis some excellent affaire I am confident, She was so merry about the lippes and eyes And praisd you to my face.

You found I had no zeale to his, how ever Lose no more time; your power with her grace May set all streight, and purchase me a pardon. Bo. Be rather lost as I am in thy dotage, Thou hast depriv'd me of the wealthiest harvest That ever Sunne-beames shin'd on. Mer. Does he thou me? How would he domineere and he were Duke? Bo. My fortune bleeds to death, tis now too late That paper ruines all my hope, and were We equall, she would scorne my want of confidence And laugh me out o'th world. Mer. Hee's very passionate. Bo.

Exit. Mer. Hee's gone and I am like to suffer for't, By your highnesse favour I will waite no longer To be chastiz'd, but when your grace is weary, You shall not neede to strike me at the doore; Tis open and I vanish in the darke; Stay and Ile send some others to attend you, You will want light, my sonne shall be no Duke I perceive now, nor will I be a Courtier; Put me to keepe the dore? Exit. Enter Cornelia, Laura, and Melinda. Cor. Did she dismisse you then? Lau. 'Twas not her pleasure We should attend. Mel. We left my Lord Mercutio Your father with her. Cor. Went she towards the Garden? Lau. Yes, where's your brother Borgia? Cor. I know not. Mel. He is infinitely beholding to her grace, She never mentions him without a flourish: I know not, but if I have any skill In lookes or language, there is something more Then common in her highnesse breast meant toward him Lau. Shee may be in love. Cor. In love with whom? Laus Your brother. Cor. I blush to heare your weakenesse, I hope he Hath more wit then to build vaine hopes on that; Eagles stoope not to flies. Mel. But the Wren Couch'd underneath the aspiring Eagles wings. Quickly advance it selfe when to'thers mounted And glories in her hight, tis but a step And the small thing is King of birds, the fable Has pretty moralls in't. Cor. I am not sure A rebell in my nature to his fortune, But dare not pawne my owne discretion To take up your opinions. Enter Pietro: Pie. Signior Pisauro your brothers friend desires To speake with you. Lau. Wee'l leave you Madam, by this time her grace May want our duties. Enter Pisauro. Pis. Did I fright you Ladies, looke better on me. Lau. We have seene you round Sir. Pis. But doe not know what's in me. Mel. We desire To die in that pretious ignorance. Exit. Pis. This Lady I hope's not of your minde. Cor. Your pleasure My servant saies you would speake with me? Pis. If you Remember Lady I was bold to urge A little counsell on you, how it fastens I come to understand. Cor. What counsell Sir. Pis. About your brother Signior Borgia. Cor. Please you assist my memory. Pis. Why it was But this, I had a kinde of feare you lovd This brother Madam. Cor. Would you have me be So impious not to affect my brother. Pis. But you lov'd him the wrong way, de'e heare lustily You understand, with the desire of coupling: There lies no dispensation for that locke, Tis impious and abhominable, you had better I'th state you are in keepe a Pensioner To give you heats, a fellow that will venture His body at all houres; then to offend once With so much sinne to nature. Cor. Doe you thinke I am a Monster Signior? Pis. Better marry An honest man and make one a great deale: Your husband may be excusd i'th progresse Lady, Besides he may have faults, a negligence In's visits, or mistaking of his times, When you are invited by another Lord To a banquet, or take physicke, or the aire Appointed by your Doctor, there are reasons To excuse an active Lady that is married But to affect your brother so, inexpiable. Cor. You have invention enough to furnish The Court with vice, how e're you seeme to have Care of my soule, pray give me pardon Sir, Doe you ever meane to marry? Pis. Marry? oh yes. Cor. Not a Court Lady sure. Pis. One of that tribe to chuse. Cor. Without the feare Of being such a monster made by her Whose wantonnesse you wittily have charactred. Pis. I'ha read my destinie, she that I shall marry Will be very honest, exceeding chast as I Shall be to her, I did but tell you what Whirligigs are i'th world, and that 'twere better And safer for your conscience to be one Of Venus order, and keepe tame a Groome A stallian Dormant then embrace a brother. Cor. What should incline you To imagine me so lost to modestie? What have you read in me to make you thinke I love my brother so? Pis. My charitie. Cor. There's little charitie in those suspitions. Have you no other argument. Pis. Your brother Told me himselfe you lov'd him strangely. Cor. So, so. Pis. Nay, nay he was i'th same pickle. Cor. He told You that himselfe too. Pis. Yes, yes, till I tamper'd with him And sacrific'd his flesh with ghostly counsell, Read Law and Lectures, I will tell you Madam He was once so overgrowne with love, he had Resolv'd to tell you he was not your brother, And rather then be frustrate of his hopes Vow'd to forsweare it, and subborne testimony He was no kin to you, borne I know not where, And never saw the towne afore, whose people Had all this while cozend themselves, with an Opinion he was Borgia; here's a youth now, Did he ne're deale with you to such a purpose. Cor. Never, he wud not be so wicked sure. Pis. Did you ever heare the like? you know it now, Thanke heaven and a good friend that told you this; A friend that wud not see this pretty vessell Lost i'th' quick-sands, when both goods and it May be his owne another day: I love you And none shall doe you wrong. Cor. I should be ingratefull Not to acknowledge Sir this noble office Meant to preserve me. Pis. That was my pure meaning, You may requite it if you please. Cor. With love. Pis. 'Tis the reward my ambition first aymes at. Cor. I love my brother now in his owne place, And being his bosome friend I will not question, But to enlarge my knowledge of your worth And take me nearer to me for his Character, And free consent. Pis. Vmph, now you blesse me Lady, If his hopes thrive in the Dutchesse as I doubt not I am made, Ile seeke him out, I wish no better Testimony, he shall not gilt you unders hand. Cor. No haste. Pis. He knowes me to a thought, nay, nay He shall doo't presently, if I can light on him. Cor. To morrow Signior, I suspect it not. Pis. It does concerne my honour, tis done instantly, She may be cold e're morning, Ile not lose This opportunitie, I am made for ever. Exit. Cor. He has an odde way of Courtship, sure my brother, Vnlesse he know him better then this wildnesse Can promise, will be sparing to contract Our hearts too fast, he has but a rough outside, But my strange thoughts within me are corrected, And I possesse my selfe againe thanke providence, Ursini. Enter Ursini. Urs. Madam I am bold to presse On your retirement, but when you remember I bring no mutinous thoughts, but such as are Devoted to your service, you will thinke it A trespasse that may soone invite a pardon. Cor. You must first practise to offend my Lord, This is favour to me. Urs. Still such goodnesse Flowes from your language to me at the first Encounter; but when I take boldnesse to Have some assurance from you alone, Which I have hop'd and serv'd for, with the truth Of your best honorer, you decline the subject, Or flie the sweet conclusion. Cor. My Lord, That you have lov'd, at least profess'd so much, May easily be granted, but let me Beseech you Sir, did you upon the first Motion that wrought upon your minde to thinke Me worthy of your love acquaint me with it. Urs. No Madam, I long cherish'd the soft fire That tryed the purenesse of it, and the object That shot so bright a flame into my bosome, And had supprest it still, but that your vertue Grew up too powerfull against it, then I tooke leave to expresse how much I wish'd To be your votary. Cor. Give me equall licence My Lord in the same cause to try my selfe, I have thoughts too would be compos'd of something In you to be examin'd. Urs. I submit, And shall obey your censure, life and death Hange on your lippe, I come to be determin'd Your servant or your sacrifice, for to languish At distance thus. Cor. Then you expect an answer Presently, I much feare my Lord I shannot, In that particular, satisfie your Lordship. Urs. You want no knowledge of me, there is nothing In my past fate but may appeare to you; My nature needs no glosse, my blood, my fortune Cleare to your view, my person not much witherd; If these together want a charme, I can Deserve you may love, for I know best The extent of my devotions, and the heart That tho you should despise it must still serve you. Cor. But good my Lord what answer you to this? Is it becomming the discretion Of a noble servant to persue his mistris By unruly wayes, and interpose commands And power of great ones to enforce the heart Of any Lady: though I must confesse Her grace may challenge my obedience To her law and person, it has beene yet a rule, And love and religion cannot be compel'd Urs. You doe not conclude me, if I obtain'd A favour from the Dutchesse to propound My wishes, and plead for me, I know well The soule is not her subject, could her power Bestow your body on me, and that I Could boast my selfe Lord of beautious frame Without your minde, I were more tyrant to Accept then she to force, and answer for A crime more fatall then the ravishers. Enter Pietro. Pie. Your brother Madam. Cor. If I have any power My Lord you must not leave me, yet I would Entreate your small retreate behinde the hangings For a few minuts. Urs. Your command's a favour. Enter Borgia. Bo. Oh Cornelia. Cor. What's the matter brother. Bo. Are you alone. Cor. You see my company. Bo. De'e love me. Cor. Love you brother, what have I Done to beget your doubt. Bor. But doe you love me More then a sister? if I were not Borgia, Remove from us the common tie of blood Which is not love, but forc'd of nature in us, Could you affect me then, then if I answerd This honour with a true and noble flame Vpon such brave conditions, Cornelia Could our hearts meete and marry? Cor. This were strange, But not so strange that we should love. Bo. Then pardon Fairest Cornelia, and make him blest Whose very soule dotes on thee, I have but Vsurp'd the name of Borgia, I can give Thee proofe. Cor. 'Tis come about. Enter Pisauro. Bo. Pisauro welcome The man of all mankind, most wishd for welcome: Madam this gentleman can witnesse I am None of your brother, we were bred together, Both borne in Millan, and my name is Aurelio Androzzi sonne to Paulo Androzzi major domo to the Dukedome, My friend too of a noble family. Pis. Did not I tell you this. Bo. Weary of home We both engag'd our selves to try our fortune Abroad, and for the warres had last designd Our selves, we tooke but Urbin in the way, Where some good starres detain'd us, and I taken For Borgia pursued thus farre the story. Cor. Ha, ha, ha. Bo. De'e laugh at me, Pisauro shee's incredulous. Speake and convince her with thy testimony. Pis. I have told enough already. Bo. She wants faith. Cor. That gentleman prepar'd me for this history Doe you not blush brother? Sir I thanke you. Pis. I am sorry for his impudence. Bo. Cornelia, Pisauro Why art thou silent. Pis. I tell you I did speake to her. Cor. 'Tis time I then dispose my selfe. Pis. Now my happinesse. Cor. My Lord I pray come forth. Enter Ursini. You Gentlemen by your owne confessions Are strangers to me, and altho I doe not Distrust heavens providence, I shall not sinne To give my freedome up where I am knowne; My Lord if you accept Cornelia Shee's thus confirm'd your owne. Urs. With greater joy Then I would take an Empire, this drops peace Vpon my brothers ashes, and unites For ever our two families. Pis. Where's the Dutchesse? Bo. I prithee doe not vexe me. Pis. Doe not vexe Thy selfe, come wee're at large, our constitution Would ha' beene troubled with a wife, we have The world before us, store of game is necessary, The Dutchesse. Enter Dutchesse, Ferrara, Pietro, Iulio, Lucio Laura Melinda. Dut. You now possesse us freely, the next morning Shall spread this joy through Urbin. Urs. We are happy And every heart congratulates.

We did not thinke y'ad beene so apprehensive, You see it now confirm'd, we hope you had No thought we meant it otherwise, be prudent And carefull in your province, heaven I see Wud have it thus, and rectifie our folly. Enter Mercutio. Mer. Your pardon gratious Madam. Dut. Signior, We thanke your diligence, possesse our favour. And know the Duke. Mer. I am one of the worst keepers of a dore, Dut.
