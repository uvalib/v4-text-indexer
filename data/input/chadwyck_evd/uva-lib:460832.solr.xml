      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Cosmo. Eleonora. Diego. Piero. Garcia. Guards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe palace of Cosmo in Pisa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Cosmo, Diego, Piero, Garcia. Cos. Oh sons, ye are not now assembled here In a light cause. 'Twill be most grateful to me, Since to the test ye now will all be brought, To make a trial of your several skills. But each of you, ere I divulge my thoughts, Swear to me solemnly to speak the truth, And in the secret of your hearts to hide The mystery which I now unfold to you. Di. I swear it by this sword. Pi. I by my father. Gar. I swear it by my honour. Cos. Hear me then.â My cause is yours: let not your heart admit Hate, love, or partialities, not mine. Such I esteem you, that I do not think That any counsel more than yours will serve me. 'Twere bootless now to recapitulate Wherefore the light inhabitants of Florence To me are irksome; wherefore I retired To seek in these beloved walls of Pisa A calmer dwelling place, ye all well know. From hence with safer and as tight a curb I equally controul the turbulent, Malignant, factious, faithless multitude, Unfit to govern, indisposed to obey; Yet their obedience is no longer doubtful; Although, on this account, I do not sit Securely on the throne. Our ancestors Often encounter'd formidable perils; And every object to my heart suggests A warning whisper, that I should not trust A transient sunshine, a fallacious calm. For the most part my enemies subdued, Dispersed, or slain, I see alone of these One formidable now remain to me: He is allied to me in blood; in mien Conciliatory; though I heed it not, He evermore pursues me like my shadow. Modest in words, obsequious in manners; But, in his inmost heart, replete with rage, And circumventive purposes ... Di. He is ... Cos. The impious Salviati.âWhat though he Be my near relative; although the son Of the brother of my mother, he no less, Than was his father once, is our sworn foe. That fierce old man, (you've heard me speak of him) Who preach'd of liberty, because the throne, Although he wish'd it, was beyond his reach; He that attempted to dissuade me from it, E'en on the very day in which I was, By the concurring senate and the people, Invited to the throne. My mother's tears, And his extreme old age, a pardon gain'd For his pestiferous audacity. But this contested sceptre he not thus Could ever pardon me. What could he do, An impotent old man? The messengers Of death he heard, and sinking to the tomb, That ineffectual poison in his heart Which he conceal'd, e'en to the very dregs He pour'd it in the bosom of his son. Now I am sure that, son of a scorn'd father, He hates me bitterly, and, what is worse, He speaks it not: hence vigilance in me Is indispensable. My mother perhaps Was, while she lived, a hindrance to his views; Now she is dead we should no more delay; We should not only wrest from him the power Of injuring, but attempting it. The means The best and speediest for such effect, Freely let each of you point out to me. Di. Father and lord, not only of ourselves But of all here, what can I say to thee Of policy of state, which thou know'st not? Methinks who pleases not his lord, of guilt, Is, by this fact, sufficiently convicted. What then is he who, hated, hates again? Say, has a monarch relatives? Since fate, When she bestows a throne, denies all friends, A prince should never tolerate a foe, Neither an open foe nor foe conceal'd. Take from him warning who before thee held The Tuscan sceptre, Alexander, he Who died, by treachery butcher'd; he should teach thee E'en more than others to distrust relations. Feign'd amity, and long-feign'd services, And consanguinity, at length bestow'd On the perfidious Lorenzo means To plunge his dagger in the royal breast. The prince in part of his refractory mind Was well aware, yet would he not diffide: Nay, he caress'd him, made him of his friends, So that at last he slew him.âAh! forestall The hate of others: lenity, display'd By those who can dispense with it, alone To terror is attributed: and kings, More than all thoughts, should hide their thoughts of fear. 'Tis the most jealous mystery of state; Woe if it be discovered; thence at once The fears of others cease; and what ensues? 'Tis my advice that Salviati perish; But let him perish in the eye of day. He offends thee; and thou condemn'st him justly. But suffer not obscure and timid clouds To intercept the vivifying rays Of thy unlimited authority. Gar. If to a prince born on the throne, and thence Beneath the tranquil shade of prosperous fate, Amid the luxuries of a court matured, I here should speak, as I intend to do, Father, thou would'st not hear me now at length. To mould the monarch who has never seen The threatening aspect of adversity, Would be a vain, impracticable task. But, Cosmo, thou who from the throne afar, And from its hopes, amid vicissitudes, Hast past thy youthful years; on Tyber's banks, Now on the shores of Adria, and now 'Mid lonely rocks of the Ligurian Alps, Concealed by thy mother; finally, Thou who hast felt the weight of powerful hatred, Lend me, I pray thee, a benignant ear. For many years have fortune, art, force, favour, Given to the Medicean race, by turns, An uncontroulable authority; To which more splendour, strength, security, Thou hast since added every day. Thou know'st That Alexander's murderer hoped in vain In a free state to meet with an asylum. Thy sword in Venice reach'd him: unavenged He fell there, where impartial laws alone Maintain authority: and in his claws The mighty lion saw the suppliant slain, Who in his roaring placed too firm a trust; He saw it, silently. Thy terrible name Made either sea that bounds Italia tremble. What wish for more? A throne without a foe? That never was: to slay them all? Hast thou A sword to do such prodigies? Reflect Upon thy ancestors: which of them died Beloved and powerful, in tranquillity? Cosmo alone, he who enjoy'd what power To him was delegated; he whom power Sought in proportion as he sought it not. Think of the others: Julian transfix'd; The bold Lorenzo scarcely saved alive; Pedro expell'd; and Alexander slain. Yet these of blood were never avaricious. Ah! these impressively suggest to thee How slippery is the basis of that throne Founded on blood.âThou wilt slay Salviati, Perhaps not guilty: other foes will rise; They may be slain; still others will succeed.â Suspicion's sword at length will turn its edge Insatiable 'gainst him that grasp'd the hilt. Ere it descend, hold it aloft a little: Strike but one blow, and it will rest no more. He who at once thee and thy fame offends, Oh father, pardon thou. Di. 'Tis ever thus From me he differs. Pi. I in years inferior, And thence in wisdom, since my sire commands, Will notwithstanding speak. Diego's words Are, like his actions, bold; nor do I blame, Although my judgment utterly dissents From his, the sentiments of Garcia. I, at the very name of Salviati, Which sounds to me like guilt, profoundly shudder. Another Salviati dared to aim At our Lorenzo the perfidious sword. Father, I only grieve that hitherto Thou'st shewn thyself too openly his foe. Not that thou e'er could'st change that double heart By more conciliatory practices; But now and then it happens that a prince Incurs less blame when he destroys his friends, Than when he punishes his foes.âBut one Of the so many deaths with which the rage Of dark Tiberius ne'er was satisfied, One only was acceptable to Rome. Whether Sejanus's conspiracy Were true or false, his obsequies were mark'd With taunts, and songs, and smiles, and public joy. Friend to the prince, to all beside the foe; Thence unavenged, abhorr'd, and vile, he fell.â Would'st thou at once have Salviati slain, And stop the comments of invidious tongues? Do what thou hast not heretofore attempted: Feign love to him; of pity thou dost rob him: Raise him; thou giv'st him a large field for error; Reward him; he will be at once a traitor. Beneath the semblance of just punishment Thus cloak revenge; and thus the prince obtains His object, and the name of merciful. Cos. Yes, one may reign with maxims such as these; But thine, Diego, I esteem more regal. He who esteems it possible to govern Without deceit or terror is a fool. Little a son's, and less a prince's thoughts, Garcia, in thee I recognize. Speak'st thou To Cosmo king, of Cosmo citizen? Would'st thou that on the throne I recollect My cruel destiny?âAnd I will do it, By baffling the attacks of adverse fate.â What strange perplexing jargon dost thou use? Thou callest terror, prudence; abjectness, Thou call'st humanity; and when I ask thee How I may slay my mortal enemy, Thou dost instruct me in the means to save him. Di. Garcia, my younger brother, born to obey me, It is no wonder should he not possess A spirit correspondent to the throne; And if he meek and private qualities Profess or feign ... Gar. Virtue will always be The same; for subjects and for kings the same. Question'd, I speak my thoughts: if such a soul As thine be requisite to royalty, I feel rejoiced that I expect no sceptre: And if, as thou allegest, I was born To obedience, I shall willingly obey, But him alone who knoweth how to rule. Cos. And I am he. And do thou recollect That I know how to make myself obey'd: Love and respect Diego as myself.â I sought alone to know your sentiments, And not to be advised. I saw, I knew, I heard: enough.âTo you, in words and deeds, And even thoughts, I only now am law. SCENE THE SECOND. Diego, Piero, Garcia. Gar. He from our deeds, far more than from our words, Can betwixt us discriminate. But yet, I feel no grief that I have thus reveal'd My judgment to my father: to my lips Perchance the feelings which my heart contains Should run less volubly; but hitherto I have not learn'd the talent to suppress, And now I fear it never will be mine. Di. What more doth Cosmo want? Within his palace, Among his sons, he finds a lofty censor Who teaches him to reign. Gar. What fearest thou? Thou ever wilt be more acceptable To him than me. To kings those are most welcome Who best know how in their sword's edge to place Infallibility. Pi. Why should your rage, Because ye differ in opinion, thus Transgress all bounds? I too dissent from you; But not, on this account, I love you less. Brothers, and sons, and subjects of one father Are not we all? Now go ... Gar. Let each of us Indulge his own opinions: praise I seek not; Nor cast I blame on others. Certainly, I say, that we shall all the grievous load Of public hate endure, if Cosmo chuse To adopt deceit or force; from this will rise The scorn of others, and from that the rage; The vengeance from them both. Di. Oh! wise and great Assuredly thou art: may it please thee To sit the moderator of our youth.â Now, when wilt thou be silent? To thy sire Thou wert already known; by him already, In such esteem as thou deservest, held. Go; if thou lovest darkness, live obscure: But, since thou addest nothing to our brightness, Make us not shadows of thy central gloom. Gar. I call that infamy which thou call'st splendour. But my discourse of that peace robs you not Which is not in yourselves: peace ill is bought With universal cries; ill with the blood Of innocent citizens. An alien Among you I am born; but, since that I Nathless am born among you, do not hope That I shall ever hide from you the truth. Pi. Thou art not, Garcia, to thy sire a foe: Then why the friend to him that does offend him? Gar. The friend of justice, and of nothing else. To you I thus address myself, but keep Towards strangers an inflexible reserve. I am willing to believe one supreme lord, Where he doth keep himself within the pale Of natural rights, doth best bested a people; But tyranny? ... It is my execration; And ah, my father doth too much affect it! I ever was more tender of his honour Than of his power: with a true love I love him, And if o'er him my prayers will not avail, They shall be all turn'd tyranny to lessen. Di. And I (if I avail) will concentrate My efforts all to give stability To sacred power, which a rash rebel dares To stigmatize unjustly. Gar. The design Is worthy of thyself. Di. Dost thou insult me? Soon will I make thee ... Pi. Stop: replace thy sword. Gar. Permit him, Piero, to display his sword. He of himself would give a worthy sample, A hopeful omen of his future reign, His sword against his brother. Pi. Ah, refrain ... And thou, be silent! ... Di. Change thy style, or I ... Gar. I clearly see: anger in thee supplies The place of reason. I am not incensed, Whom reason only moves. Di. Perhaps thou art More backward in performance than in speech; Hence art thou not incensed. Gar. Far more am I To terror, than to action, indisposed. Di. And who knows this? Gar. My sword.âAnd thou should'st know it ... If I were not thy brother. SCENE THE THIRD. Diego, Piero. Di. Thou, my brother? We evermore were too dissimilar. Pi. Appease thyself; thy generous resentment He merits not. Heard'st thou his insolence? Heard'st thou how proudly he exults in treason, Much less then blushes at it? Di. Thou shalt see One day, that he will be forced to renounce His foolish pride: wait till I reign, and then ... Pi. To thee, 'tis true, the throne belongs by right; But not by accident speaks Garcia thus. Well know I, that my father hath reposed All his affection, all his hope in thee; To him art thou far dearer than the light: But he descends towards the decline of life. Thou know'st how love in aged hearts grows cold; How feebly hoary age defends itself 'Gainst female stratagems. This Garcia is His mother's darling: she's possess'd by him: And, thou know'st, loves us little ... Di. What fear I? The throne to me is due; not e'en my sire Could take it from me. Grant that he could do it, I should suffice to re-obtain it. Well, Our father knows us. Pi. It is true; but art ... Di. Art to the vile I give. I know that he Is too dear to his mother. Equally Were he to Cosmo, should I heed it? no! I fear not, hate not, envy not my brother. Pi. But thou know'st not what culpable designs Garcia hides in his heart ... Di. And do I ever Investigate the purposes of others? Pi. But unknown to his father ... Di. And would I, Think'st thou, repeat them to him? That would be In me far viler than in other men: Since betwixt us harsh menaces have past, Each word of mine would seem like craft or vengeance. I know my father, and am well aware How little he is able to subdue The first assaults of rage; to fatal proof 'Twere better not to bring him. If my brother Deteriorates spontaneously, let him Alone abide the consequence of this. But if he any more attempts to offend me, I hope, he cannot say, that for his wrongs I've sought redress from any but himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Cosmo, Eleonora. Cos. No, I am not mistaken; no: a son More worthy than Diego we possess not; The honour of the throne, his father's safety, The universal peace, he has at heart. I had indubitable proofs of this From his own lips a little while ago. Ele. Then hast thou never in my Garcia found Love, judgment, gentleness of character, And pliancy of heart? Cos. What words are these? How dost thou designate that rebel spirit? Of all my sons, he is the only one Unworthy of the name. What do I say, Among my sons? Far, far more than by him, By every other am I loved and reverenced. A serpent, who on me turns all his rage, And his dire poison, in my breast I cherish. How difficulty, when to him I listen'd, Did I restrain my rage! Surmise is now Matured to certainty: and Garcia is ... Ele. What has he done? What has he said? In what Offended thee? Alas ... Cos. What has he said? Whilst of a mortal foe I plan the death, He dares to counsel me to pardon him. Thence, much as I abhor him, he abhors not The guilty Salviati? Thence my foes Are not his foes? Ele. And is not every man Thy subject that dwells here? If this, or that, It pleaseth thee to slay, dost thou not do it? 'Tis in a son a venial offence To supplicate his sire to be less cruel. 'Tis true, that neither Piero nor Diego From bloodshed dared dissuade thee: Garcia dared. What doth this indicate, except that he Is more benignant, and for human blood Pants not? Cos. This overweening, ill-placed love, More than it ought to do, thy judgment blinds. Thou'st made an idol to thyself in Garcia; Save him thou lovest, and thou seest nothing: That which I call a crime, dar'st thou in him Call virtue?â This altercation is not new betwixt us, But every day it more displeases me. And thou wilt make an effort to myself Most acceptable, if within thy heart Thou hide a love so partial and unjust. Ele. An unjust love? Ah! if there be who thus Can prove it to me, I at once will change it. Not on the words, but actions of my sons, My observation has been fix'd. Cos. So be it; If then thou wilt, in spite of me, let him Be dear to thee; so that I never more Hear thee excuse his failings. In my palace, The first and only virtue is to please me: This virtue hitherto I see not in him: It doth belong to thee to teach him this; To thee, ... if thou sincerely lovest him. Ele. And hath not Garcia always bent his brow To thy behests? Cos. What merit hath obedience? And this sufficeth it? And not to do it, Who now would have the hardihood?âHe ought To speak not only as I speak, but ought To think e'en as I think: he who has not A nature like to mine, should change it: yes: Not simulate, but change it. Of my race, And of my realm, I am the head; the soul Am I, with which each living creature here Is animated.âNor, on guilty Garcia, Had he not been my son, had I bestow'd Even a warning ere I punish'd him. Hence is his crime assuredly augmented; But yet once more, or ere his chastisement, Once only will I make him hear a voice, That from perdition's path may rescue him. SCENE THE SECOND. Cosmo, Eleonora, Piero. Pi. Father, most urgent business brings me to thee; With thee I would confer at leisure. Cos. Oh! What strange disturbance on thy face I read! Speak; what hath happen'd? say. Pi. I cannot speak it, Except to thee alone. Ele. What can a son Have of mysterious for a father's ears, Thus from a mother carefully conceal'd? Cos. I am a father; but at the same time I am a prince; nor hast thou hitherto, Lady, with me my public burthens shared; Nor wilt thou share them, if, as I suspect ... Ele. Thou dost suspect the truth. Scarcely had I The native shores of my Sebetus quitted, Than I, become the sharer of thy fate, All my attachments, all my objects bounded, Within these royal walls. In me thou gained'st A consort, and a handmaid, nothing more. Clearly I saw my lord thought every proof Of love was centred in a blind obedience. Hence always I obey'd; this thou know'st well; Often in tones of gratitude hast thou Praised me for this. Would'st thou remain alone? I leave thee: and already I infer From him who tells it, what this secret is: And I know why I only should not hear it. But I wish not to hear Piero's tongue, Possessing such alacrity to injure: If only to the detriment of strangers It were exerted, I should not at least Then tremble at it, as I tremble now. I, of his well-known arts, am doubtlessly A most unwelcome witness. Pi. Thou hast placed All thy maternal fondness on one son; Hence are the others guilty; and, meanwhile, Hence do I suffer heavy punishment; And, indeed, may it fall alone on me! My tongue is evermore prepared to injure? This thy beloved son says so, to whom I bear no hatred, though I envy him: Let him confess, if, or in words or deeds, I ever injured him.âA horrid stain Thou fixest on me, mother: yet should I, If any other than my mother fix'd it, Be more afflicted; or if any one Heard it, besides my father and my lord, To me imputed. But I know my duty; I ought to suffer and to hold my peace; I suffer, and am silent. Cos. Lady, would'st thou, With manners such as these, in tumult throw Our palace? Ele. Ah, that others would not do it! And hath not an abominable pest Already fix'd its residence among us? I yield my place: and may I never know, And never thou believe, his odious secrets! SCENE THE THIRD. Cosmo, Piero. Cos. Piero, speak. Pi. My mother's prophecies In part are true. An execrable pest Rises among us. Cos. Where I reign, no pest Exists that can mature; e'en from the roots It shall be torn up: speak. Pi. I know full well That all depends on thee: of every wound Thou art the sovereign healer; hence I seek In thee alone a speedy remedy.â Erewhile there rose, 'twixt Garcia and Diego, A war of words: their fury with great pains I check'd; but certainly 'tis not extinguish'd. Inflamed, and fierce, Garcia went out: with prayers, Mingled with force, Diego I restrain'd: The aggressor he will never be, no never; But, from the other, if one look escape, One word, one gesture to provoke him, heavens! I tremble to reflect on what may follow. Cos. Perpetual discord; I already knew it: But what new provocation hath impell'd them To yield to such ungovernable rage? Pi. When thou erewhile didst quit us, we remain'd In earnest conference. Diego, fired In words as well as deeds with noble ardour, With that imposing frankness he possesses, Openly blamed his brother Garcia, (And blamed, methinks, not wrongfully,) that he, Alone, dared in thy presence to defend The guilty cause of Salviati. Pierced E'en to his inmost heart (for the rebuke Was too well founded,) Garcia had recourse To threats against his brother: and had he Outraged Diego only! ... but to thee I ought not to repeat that which escaped, While hot with passion, from his breast: and perhaps He thought it not; anger sometimes excites To utter that which is not. And to me, While I essay'd to reconcile them both, He darted pungent and injurious words: But this imports not.â'Tis expedient now, That he should hear the thunder of thy voice, So that this contest gain no further strength. Cos. There is no doubt; all things convince me of it: Garcia, that impious son, betrays his sire, His lord, his honour, and himself, at once. He would, by this aggression on Diego, Obliquely wound his father: he assumes Blind confidence from blind maternal love; And to the highest pitch audacity In him is risen. Erewhile, I wish'd to hear If he would dare deliberately disclose The vile and guilty friendship in my presence That he hath long encouraged in his heart: And it is not to me, oh no! unknown, As much as witlessly he thinks it is. Pi. Thou, then, indeed dost know it, that he is Clandestinely of Salviati? Cos. Yes; I know it; thoroughly convinced ... Pi. Himself, Against his will ... Cos. And why have ye conceal'd It hitherto from me? Pi. He is our brother ... Cos. And am not I the father of you all? Pi. I hoped, indeed, that to the path of duty He would return; and still I dare to hope it. Still in that unripe age are we, thou seest, When man is most apt to be led astray. Each of us might, caught in such snares, become Guilty of similar failings. Cos. Ah! no snares Could ever make you traitors: for ye are, ... Diego, and thyself ... Pi. Diego never; I hope so of myself; and every man Affirms it of himself while he is sane. But who can answer for the consequence, If love, the enemy of reason, rule him? Cos. What say'st thou? Love! Pi. If thou reflect on this, Less heinous will his fault appear to thee. Cos. Love, say'st thou? Love for whom? Pi. Thou know'st it, father. Cos. I know that he's a traitor; that he oft Dares meet in secret interview, at night, With Salviati in my palace, here, But that love prompted him, I never knew: What may this love be? Speak. Pi. Ah wretched me! ... I would excuse him, and I have accused him. Cos. Speak: I command thee; and hide nothing from me, Or I ... Pi. Ah! father, pardon him, I pray, This youthful indiscretion, and ascribe Nothing that he does to a will depraved. Love only makes him seem a traitor. He Loves guilty Salviati's guiltless daughter: The gentle Julia, whom thou hast perchance Retain'd a hostage for her father's faith, Among th'illustrious damsels in thy court; Julia he loves; she, ere scarce seen, inflamed him. He loves her secretly; and, loved again, He lives in sweet though ineffectual hope. Now that the father of a maid beloved Should not seem guilty to her paramour, Why should this seem so wonderful to thee? Cos. All men then know the errors of my sons More than myself? All men excuse them? hide them? His partial mother incontestably Is privy also to this guilty secret; And seconds it perchance ... Pi. In truth, I think not ... But yet, who knows ... Cos. This simulated love What can it be, except a specious veil For future treasons? Can my son be dear To Julia for his own sake? Is she not The daughter of my foe? And hath she not, E'en with her milk, imbibed hatred for me, And for my blood? Deep treasons are conceal'd Beneath this love: the daughter, doubtlessly, Is made an instrument of his revenge By the shrewd father; I am not mistaken. And my own son? ... Pi. Perchance thou construest well Their secret schemes: but think it not of Garcia: A fervid love assuredly excites him; And the blind guide doth often not conduct To a good path: perchance he hence has err'd. Now that thou know'st the whole do thou restrain him, But with a gentle rein: do not so act, That I with reason may regret to-day That I've betray'd, although by chance I did it, His jealous amorous secret. It is true, He never told it to me; but he is Reserved to all, and most so to his brothers: But yet I knew it.âNow, since I have said it, Turn it to his advantage. Wean him, father, From this disgraceful fondness; and at once Appease his unjust rage against his brothers. Cos. Thou hast done well to speak: a son and subject It was thy duty; I shall seek to know More of this matter.âBut Diego comes. SCENE THE FOURTH. Diego, Cosmo, Piero. Cos. My son, what would'st thou? Justice? Thou shalt have it. Di. Father, what ails thee? On thy austere brow Sits dark displeasure. Perhaps our strife hath wrought Disturbance in thee? It had been, Piero, Better indeed for us to have hid it from him: And what? Fear'st thou that for my brother's insult Anger in me all limits would transgress? Ah, let my father think no more of it; Nor let it raise in him resentful feelings. Esteem me not offended; I alone Pity th'offender: this is my revenge. Cos. Oh, thou art worthy of a better brother Than Garcia is! Fraternal injuries Thou dost endure; and it becomes thee well: But that he has infringed my laws, that he Erewhile contended with thee, this is not The first sole cause of my profound displeasure. His turbulence, I clearly see, springs not From the impetuosity of youth; 'Tis the worse fruit of a malignant heart: I am compell'd e'en to the fountain head Of the mortiferous pestilence to go; I am compell'd t'investigate the whole, The whole to hear. Imperiously it behoves me To know the deeds, th'affections, and the words, The enterprises, e'en the secret thoughts, Of one, a royal youth, who, more than others, Has power to injure, and may fear it less. Di. Yet do not now ascribe to guilt in him, I pray thee, that which erewhile, when incensed, He said to me. Pi. Thou seest clearly, father, If Garcia had a corresponding soul, Peace would be permanent betwixt them both; Nor doth Diego feign ... Di. Nor hitherto Have I suspected that my brother feign'd, Or was malignant. No, my father, no; Although he differ from me, I perceive The seeds of virtue in him; I esteem him A little from the path of rectitude Unconsciously misled: he cherishes Private affections in his princely nature; Hence are those phrases which appear so strange; Hence he so frequently dissents from us; And hence th'injurious lofty pomp with which He preaches to us his ascetic virtues. I first, inflamed with anger, in thy presence, Calling him hypocritical and false, Presumed to assault him: to a lofty heart Th'indignity was insupportable; And scarcely was in me my wrath appeased, Ere I repented of it. I come here, In the first place, expressly to recant; And inasmuch as my officiousness May have excited prejudice in thee Against thy son, to abrogate at once Impressions sinister, as they are false. Cos. Garcia assuredly is less a traitor, Than thou magnanimous. Di. We are thy sons ... Cos. Thou art indeed: Piero and thyself. Pi. At least, I prize myself in thinking so. Di. Ah! do not deem thy other son yet lost: I do beseech thee, to thyself, and us, Reclaim him, father; but with gentle treatment. Advice, far more than force, will operate On his tenacious heart; and never shew him That, less than us, thou lovest him. Cos. My sons, Enough, enough. Withdraw: I will indulge you. Ere long to me, Piero, thou send here Thy brother Garcia; I will speak to him. Nor do I less commend in thee, Piero, The strict solicitude, than in Diego The sublime magnanimity of heart. SCENE THE FIFTH. Cosmo. Cos. Oh worthy pair of sons!âWhat star of mine Will join to you a third with such deserts? Though I deem'd Garcia guilty, I ne'er deem'd His guilt was so atrocious. But, methinks, With what impression ought I to behold Diego, who, though destined to command, Solicits pardon for received offences. It grieves me to be forced to praise in him That with my tongue, which in my heart I blame. But yet he is a novice in the arts Of government; in time he'll be more wise. I see within him all the qualities That form a perfect prince. I must instruct him, By my example, that, to govern well, The less we should forgive, e'en as the ties Of blood are more implicit, and the more Th'offender to the offended is allied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Cosmo, Garcia. Gar. See me, oh father, at thy call.âThy words, If it be lawful to anticipate With prompt and humble filial respect, I now, by first accusing my own fault, Can somewhat mitigate thy just displeasure, And my own shame. Oh, could I thus appear A little less unworthy in thy eyes Of pardon! nought else in the world I wish. Stung by Diego, I insulted him; I do regret this deeply: nor could'st thou A punishment inflict that might compare With my repentance. Dearer to thyself, Older than I, and by long habitude Of all my actions the appointed censor, Diego should find nothing else in me But full obsequious silence, patience, peace. Cos. What I would say to thee, thou hast in part Forestall'd; but not the whole. It pleases me To hear that from thy breast all hate is banish'd; Whate'er may be its cause, I feel no wrath Paternal, that subsides not at thy words. I never yet have entertain'd a doubt But that the rage would be no sooner cool'd, Which to exasperating words impell'd you, Than that both instantly would come to me To make atonement. Now there doth arise, T'obliterate the first, betwixt you both The nobler strife of self-disparagement; Whence I absolve you both, and neither deem Guilty in this.âFurther I now would say.â Within my mind have I revolved thy counsel, Which, as inopportune and indiscreet, I blamed this morning. Now thou art convinced That the first judgment is not always best: E'en in proportion as I meditate, 'Mid various other sentiments, on thine, Less they displease me. Not that I believe That I should blindly trust in Salviati; Too much he hates me: but he also fears, And fears effectively. Had I the power To introduce betwixt our mutual hate A valid obstacle, or to devise Such ties as might reciprocally join us In firm alliance, in one word a means Whence common interests might league us both, And make us both secure, I might perchance Not only wean my heart from schemes of blood, But further, with conciliatory thoughts Dispose it to relent ... Gar. What do I hear? Can this be true, my father? What a tide Of lofty transport inundates my breast! Not that I dare found the presumptuous hope On my opinions, that I can instruct My sovereign lord; but real joy I feel To be convinced, that, to obtain his ends, My father rather chuses to use means Of gentleness, than menaces and blood. Centred is all authority in him Who sits upon the throne; he, at his will, Can mitigate, or strengthen fear or hate, In all his vassals.âCould he utterly Eradicate them from the hearts of others, And from his own!âBut niggard fate denies Such blest exemption to the breasts of monarchs. Cos. But what would be the consequence, if I With too great mildness should reproach myself? Gar. Was a good heart e'er self-reproach'd for this? Nor should'st thou fear that injury to thee Can thence result. The customary hate Of those by royal prejudice pursued, To Salviati's elevated soul Is utterly unknown. He knows full well That he has forfeited thy love for ever: He hath no hope, nor hath he any fear, To check his projects: for himself he fears not; He, when he lost thy favour, lost his all. Yet, notwithstanding this, he doth propose To all his deeds, one uniform condition, How he may please thee best; and thou by means Direct canst never lose him, if thou dost not Take indirect ones to indulge thy rancour. Cos. There are then who deceive me? ... Oh sad lot Of those who are most powerful! How ferocious Have others represented him to me! Here, all are emulously fraudulent; And each one to his private projects makes My power subservient ... Gar. It is known to all That Salviati's father was thy foe: Hence each one emulously paints his son To thee an infamous, perfidious rebel ... Cos. Ah, thou dost speak too truly! Ill a prince, If others penetrate his heart, can know The hearts of other men.âBut tell me further: Whence dost thou now so accurately know What are his dispositions? Although he Has followed me to Pisa, in my court Him have I never seen. What do I say, In court? All human converse he avoids, And drags on such a solitary life, That one would say, that he in secret broods O'er heavy incommunicable thoughts; And that of every man he is mistrustful. Gar. If it were lawful, I would say ... Cos. Speak on: The truth is pleasing to me; I delight To hear thee. Gar. In thy footsteps here he came, But only to remove from thee all doubt Of his fidelity; for in the midst Of factious spirits, with which Florence teems, Thou always would'st have held that faith precarious. With him sometimes I have had interviews; This I deny not: ah, hadst thou but heard him! His heart surcharged with bitterness and anguish, With how much reverence, and with how much fear, He, with subdued resentment, mourn'd thy error; And never thee, but thy perfidious friends, The persevering foes to truth alone He blamed for this; and even deems not thine Thy own suspicions ... Cos. But that thou'rt my son He knows; how tell thee? ... Gar. Perhaps he thinks me Of pity capable ... Cos. I understand: Thy influence with me in his favour ... Gar. He Knows that my words on thee are ineffectual ... Cos. Thou hast perchance divulged to him thy secrets:â Thou always sad; always, like him, alone:â Perhaps common sympathies unite you both. He pitying thy wrongs, as thou pitiest his, Without exception may not hate my blood? He hears thee, speaks to thee? far different ... Gar. Ah different, yes, from that which fame reports him. Thou dost inspire me with a hardihood Which I had never of myself assumed. Know, that thy dearest friend (chuse whom thou wilt 'Mong those whom thou with honours and with gold Hast laden, I will not say surfeited,) I swear, is less devoted to thy service, And loves thee less, and less would risk for thee, Than that degraded, obscure Salviati, Assured in heart of his own innocence, Which, to increase the poignance of his woes, He's not allow'd to prove.âIf in contempt He such is found, reflect what he would be If worthily esteem'd. Cos. ... Truly this man Hath roused a tender interest in thy heart: Thy words are strong, yet hence I blame thee not. Since thou assertest it, he must at least Have some good qualities: but speak; and speak The truth; thou know'st not how to lie already? Now do his virtues only thus excite Thee to commend him? Gar. Ah! since thou dost think I know not how to lie, I will not now E'en partially divulge to thee the truth. Love also rouses me: I burn for Julia; And hence have double pity for the father. Cos. And he knows this? Gar. I told it him. Cos. He aids thee? Gar. No, he condemns it: I condemn it also. Nay, what dost thou suppose me? Cos. Circumspect, But not in time. Gar. Love doth not blind me, no; Nor doth it rob me of integrity. I speak to thee in praise of Salviati, Since in subservience to his principles He holds all selfish interests: otherwise I would have represented him to thee, If I had found him otherwise; were he As he is adverse, to my love propitious. I have not learn'd to varnish o'er the truth; Nor do I even with a latent hope Foster the passion that consumes my vitals: Which neither I will nourish in my heart, Nor can I e'er extinguish it. I know That thy inflexible and austere will From Julia separates me eternally. Pity from thee I do not ask: too well I know, for this immitigable wound I have no other remedy than death! I have entreated for her innocent father, For such I know he is; but were he not, Love would ne'er lead me to betray my own. Cos. Perfidious, I would hear from thy own lips The whole; but thou speak'st not the whole to me. Thy love for Julia is thy least offence. Gar. Oh Heaven! What do I hear? Must I ne'er deem Goodness in thee sincere? Cos. Thou never should'st, Thinking of thee, no never!âFully thou Dost know thy heart, thou traitor.âI erewhile Have sought the means, whence I might take away That miscreant from my eyes: fortune, behold, Brings them to me; and indicates at once The instrument. Is it thy wish to clear Thyself of turpitude in my opinion? Would'st thou that I should deem love thy sole crime? Little of this declining day remains: At the first gathering of the shades of night, Let guilty Salviati come unknown, Clandestinely, within my palace walls, As heretofore he has been wont to come; And thou invite him; and do thou conduct him To the accustom'd haunt, in which so oft He has conversed with thee: and there do thou (Woe fall on thee if thou refuse me this!) Plunge in his breast this sword. Gar. Oh Heaven! Cos. Be silent. Thou hast betray'd thy sire, thy lord, thyself: This is th'atonement. What? when I command Dar'st thou resist? Gar. And dost thou stand in need Of other hands more infamous for this? Cos. I have selected thine: let that suffice. Gar. I will first perish. Cos. Say not so; my hand Grasps the sure earnest of thy prompt obedience. SCENE THE SECOND. Garcia. Gar. What looks! ... Alas ... Oh father, hear ... Oh words! But, of what earnest speaks he? Through each vein I feel an unaccustom'd chillness creep. Perhaps he alludes to Julia? ... Yes ... what pledge Can vie with her? Oh Heaven! ... What can I do? ... SCENE THE THIRD. Eleonora, Garcia. Ele. Son, whither dost thou go? Ah stay; to me Interpret the mysterious words of Cosmo. Hither he hath dispatch'd me to assist thee: Wherefore? Say what has happen'd? ... Gar. Oh, my mother! ... What did he say to thee? Ele. âGo; give advice âTo thy beloved Garcia, now he needs thee: âAnd make him recollect.ââNor added more; But with a countenance more discomposed Than ever I beheld in him, pass'd on. Now speak; delay not; what has happen'd? Gar. Mother, Know'st thou this sword? Ele. I, at thy father's side, Have always seen it hang; and what of this? ... Gar. This is an instrument of government: Ah, were it Cosmo's only! Ne'er should I Contaminate with it my innocent hand! But to this right-hand my unnatural father Himself consign'd it, and insists that I Plunge it by stealth in Salviati's breast. Ele. What do I hear? ... Oh Heaven! ... But whence to thee Commits he such a terrible revenge? Gar. He chuses me, only because I feel Pity for Salviati; and because I am not yet contaminate with blood; Because the daughter, the unhappy daughter, Of that unhappy father, I adore. Ele. What say'st thou? Julia! Gar. I love Julia; yes; And indiscreetly I myself declared That love to Cosmo: hence in him arose Th'unnatural wish, worthy of him alone, To make the father of the maid beloved Die by the lover's hands. Time serves not now To say to thee how I was first enthrall'd By so much beauty join'd to so much virtue; Nor, if I told it, would'st thou blame it, mother; Now I alone assure thee that I love her, And that I will far sooner sacrifice My own life than her father's. Ele. Ah! ... my son! ... Alas! ... what say'st thou? ... and what shall I do? Oh fatal love! ... Although I love thee far, Far more than aught besides, I cannot praise it. Gar. Julia is ever at thy side, oh mother; Thou knowest well, and equally dost prize Her rare accomplishments; and thou dost love her More than all other damsels of thy court: Thence thou may'st well infer that I deserve At least to be excused, if not commended. But, if thou rather wilt, condemn me: never Have I displeased thee, mother: I have held Thy smallest wish inviolably sacred. And I, at least, if I cannot root out This love, can moderate its ecstacies. I only ask of thee that thou would'st save That heavenly and defenceless innocence, From Cosmo's pitiless and fatal grasp. I wish to save her, not to make her mine. Incensed, and loading me with frantic threats, Cosmo departed hence: perchance one crime Will not suffice to his ferocious heart; Perhaps Julia too ... oh Heaven! ... Ah, mother, fly; If I was ever dear to thee, go now, Watch o'er my love. Who knows? ... Ele. Thy love excites In thee immoderate fear ... Gar. All may be fear'd From Cosmo's deadly rage: thou yet hast time; Thou hast the remedy; it now behoves thee His fury to delude; 'twere vain to sooth him. As best it may be done, deliver Julia; And meanwhile feign that I am now almost Prepared t'obey: time, and nought else, I ask. In fine, thou art a mother; and the love Thou bear'st thy son shall animate thy heart. Thou oughtest from so horrible a crime T'exempt a son; thou oughtest to deliver From unjust violence an innocent maid. Thou see'st me now humble myself in tears, And supplicate while yet a hope remains: Woe, if my father goad me to revenge; Woe, if he dare to wreak his rage on her In whom alone I live! Rivers of blood Shall be effused to inundate the palace; And this my arm shall shed it. Then no more Shall I hear reason; then no more shall deem Myself a son. Ele. Ah calm thyself; what say'st thou? Thou seest things that are not: far from thee Be e'en the thought of such extravagance ... Gar. Do thou, oh mother, then anticipate That which thou canst not afterwards prevent. From this severe extremity, to which I'm driven by my father, do thou find Some method of escape for me, that I Be not a traitor. Ele. Yes, son, yes; but calm Thy irritated soul: to him I fly. Ah may I change his horrible resolve! Julia I will at least in safety place, To give thee peace. Meanwhile I interdict Thee from attempting aught till I return. SCENE THE FOURTH. Garcia. Gar. If Julia is not safe, I will do nothing.â Alas! what do I hope? that to cheat Cosmo My mother may avail, who bears the marks Of apprehension in her every look? Oh, from what father am I sprung! Alike Crafty and cruel, can he be deceived? Much less be moved to pity ... Yet he will not Have wreaked his rage upon the timid maid, Ere he has learn'd that I refuse to strike Th'atrocious blow ... Shall I consent to it? ... SCENE THE FIFTH. Piero, Garcia. Pi. Brother, what hast thou done? Alas! ... Gar. What ails thee? Pi. In truth I now do pity thee sincerely. Gar. Now? ... What has happened? ... Pi. Oh unhappy brother! Cosmo doth threaten thee, and darkly frowns, Pronouncing thee a traitor. Gar. Such I am not. Pi. But yet my father is exasperate Beyond all bounds. He hath already summon'd Into his presence Salviati's daughter, Laden with heavy and opprobrious chains. Gar. Oh Heaven! ... Vile tyrant ... I will fly ... Pi. Ah! ... Where? Gar. To drag her from unworthy chains. Pi. Thou may'st Drag her to horrid death by thy imprudence. Under the penalty of death he gave her Into the custody of cruel Geri. If he, by whomsoever it may be, Perceives the smallest action in her favour, Geri is bidden instantly to slay her With his own hands ... Gar. We soon shall see ... Pi. Ah stop! ... What would'st thou do? Gar. To slay her? Oh distraction! ... But was he not accosted by my mother? ... Pi. She came erewhile; but the terrific sentence Was executed. She would speak to him; But her indignant consort silenced her: She wept; but tears he told her were not wanted: He said, âTo exculpate himself from all, âI to thy Garcia have consign'd the means.â Gar. Of what, of what, to exculpate myself? Being thy son? Indelible that blot.â Gave me the means? Thou seest what means: this sword, Which in the breast of wretched Salviati I am appointed treacherously to plunge. Ah Cosmo, why am I a son of thine? Ah, were I not, this sword would then, indeed, Be the best means to exculpate myself. But against thee I cannot; oh distraction! ... Against myself ... Pi. What would'st thou do? ... Desist ... Gar. Rather than see that much-loved maiden dragg'd To ignominious death, rather than be Polluted with her father's blood, I here Would kill myself ... Pi. Ah pause; ... listen to me; ... Reflect that Cosmo is unchangeable. He, at all risks, wills Salviati's death: And if from thee he wills it, by thy death Thou sav'st not him; rather reservest him For pangs more exquisite: ah, thou well knowest, Whether, because defrauded of its means, Cosmo's revenge abates. And th'innocent daughter, Perhaps she too ... Gar. Oh Heaven! Pi. But why perhaps? It is too sure! If thou refuse t'obey, Father and daughter he will immolate. Gar. Thou mak'st me shudder with excess of horror. But how can I destroy, and treacherously, A just and innocent man? Hither entice At night, and under the flagitious mask Of simulated amity, a friend, The father of the lady I adore? ... Pi. Ah! surely such extremity as thine Was never heard before; nor are there minds So firm, as not to shrink from such a trial. But yet what would'st thou? What else canst thou do? Thou only canst accumulate crime on crime. Let one alone expire; that were the best ... Gar. And shall I live? ... Pi. Hear me. He is the culprit Who forces thee to such a crime, not thou.â But yet I can in part lessen for thee The horror of this stratagem, if thou Permittest that the messenger be sent By me to Salviati in thy name. Resolve; resolve at once; and oh! reflect In what unutterable agony Thy Julia languishes ... Gar. Beloved Julia! ... And shall I kill thy father? ... No, I cannot ... Yet, if I slay not him, I murder thee ... For I can neither perish nor avenge thee, And scarcely can I save thee!âBut I ought, Ere I resolve, once more to hear my mother: Perchance my grief, my rage, my desperate love, May point another path. Pi. Ah no! ... Gar. But yet If 'tis my fate, that I this horrid crime ... Hear me: if I return not in an hour Hither to thee, it is indeed too true That I was forced to chuse to immolate The father of my Julia.âThen I leave To thee, since thou wilt have it so, the task To send the impious messenger of death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Piero, Diego. Di. Say, what does Garcia in his thoughts revolve? For like a man whose reason is bereft I saw him come, and go, and come again. Pi. Dost thou not know that he ... Di. What should I know Of him? Thou seest that from the woodland chace Weary and breathless I return. I know That I bring back a plenteous spoil; nought else. But as an arrow darting silently And swiftly by me, Garcia towards me cast Inflamed and furious looks. Say, what new rage Invades his heart? Pi. Ah! 'tis not new: for he Always avoids, blames, envies, even scorns thee, Whenever he can do it. Perhaps to see thee Of all thy regal ornaments despoil'd, As now thou art; divested of thy sword; And in thy aspect rather like to one That dwells in forests than a monarch's son, Perhaps this excited him to such a mute, Though supercilious comment. Evermore That which he does not, he condemns in others. Di. 'Tis a propensity, methinks, more royal To harass wild beasts in th'adventurous chace, Than evermore immured 'mid ponderous volumes, Wrapt in soft indolence, to learn to fear. His supercilious looks excite my pity. But whither goes he in such wond'rous haste? Pi. Great projects he revolves. His father now He seeks in haste, now to his mother flies, And thus employ'd, with zealous speed improves The lucky interval. Diego absent, And I excluded from these interviews; Thou seest the opportunity for intrigue Is too inviting to be overlook'd. I know no further: but the guilty friendship Of Garcia and Salviati, once Call'd treason, now is call'd a slight imprudence: And that so oft repeated prate with thee, Which once was insolence, with other terms Is designated now a youthful fire: And that contempt for individual power Which he professes openly, I hear Now call'd a thoughtless eccentricity. Just indignation every day I see Arise in Cosmo; but the senile flame By female artifice is soon extinguish'd. In short, this morning Garcia heard himself Pronounced a traitor; and this very day (Or ere 'tis closed) he hears himself from all Exculpated, defended, and exalted; And even yet, perchance, he may behold Himself rewarded. Di. What indeed does that Import to us? Shall I afflict myself That Garcia gains once more my father's favour? Perhaps this alone may lead him to reform? Pi. And am I more invidious than thyself Of other men's advantages? But yet Th'imposture grieves me, and e'en more than this The fatal and inevitable ruin Threatening our race, our father, and thyself. Di. My father? and myself? Say, what would Garcia? What can he? Pi. He would reign: and may indeed, If thou art silent. Di. Reign? ... But have I not A sword? Pi. Far different arms he wields. Erewhile, A transient wrath against himself inflamed thee; Thou know'st not how to hate, or recollect The injuries of others: but, if they Cherish them in the bottom of their hearts; If black and fervid anger rankle there, Ready at every instant to explode ... Di. But th'impious contest Cosmo hath not yet Consign'd to deep oblivion? ... Pi. So I deem; But Garcia deems otherwise. Di. But thou, Thou seem'st to come to me to stir up strife. How can my brother injure me? Pi. Indeed, I am the brand of discord 'twixt you both: Do thou, abandoning thy judgment, stand Securely in thy valour; I, like thee, Might be secure, if I did love thee less. Attribute it to thy propitious fate That I discover'd his designs in time. Now at once thy security and ours Compel me to develope them to thee: For, had I wish'd t'excite disturbances, I had divulged them only to my father: But yet I will go there, if thou refuse To hear me. Di. What has happen'd then? Relate. Pi. The silent night with more than usual gloom Already is advanced. Within the grot Which terminates the hollow avenue, Embower'd in shade of lofty cypresses, Thither doth Salviati now repair, By Garcia bidden, to a guilty council: Perchance already he is hidden there, And every moment there expects his friend. There they've agreed upon to fix the means Of final vengeance. I have learn'd the whole From him who was their chosen messenger. Prayers, menaces, and vigilant espial, Much art and bribes, have now disclosed to me The horrible mystery: in short ... But what Do I behold? For once at least I see Amazement stamp'd on thy intrepid face! ... Yet that which I affirm to thee is little: Do thou be irrefragably convinced With thy own ears; and be thy eyes alone The witnesses of my veracity. Di. But what a miscreant is he then! The day, The very day on which my father pardons His past offences, new ones he projects.â He runs to certain ruin. Pi. But to it He first goads us. Thou know'st by Salviati Thou art not less detested than thy father. Scarcely will Garcia have divulged to him That thou advisedst Cosmo first to slay him, Than he ... I tremble to express it ... Both Are madden'd with resentment: artifice To malice will be join'd; for stratagems The time is opportune: ... and wilt thou be Neglectful? Be so then; I fly to Cosmo, Come what come may.âThe method I devise To obviate more mischief, to procure Deliverance for us all; and thou dost spurn it. My father then shall be resorted to: And he, the witness of their trait'rous plot, With me shall go to them. Di. Ah no! desist: Think that a man can never be the accuser Who holds himself not viler than the accused. By what means would'st thou that I thwart the traitor? Speak; I will do it. Pi. Thou should'st first hear all: 'Tis easy from detected stratagems To extricate oneself: thou may'st alone, Without the interposition of thy father, When thou hast once convicted him of treason, Keep, with thy valour, Garcia at bay; Inspire his heart with salutary fear; And even yet to duty's path restore him.â Ah go! already is the hour arrived: Now hide thyself within the gloomy grot; And there wilt thou hear unexpected things. Di. Thou dost compel me to it; and I yield, Although against my will, that to this place My father may not be enticed by thee: He would inflict a too severe revenge. Pi. Ah yes! I also tremble at the thought: Yet 'tis our duty to anticipate The ill designs of others ... But methinks ... I hear a noise ... it is himself ... step softly ... 'Tis Garcia.âCome, enter unseen; make haste. SCENE THE SECOND. Piero. Pi. At length he's safely lodged.âI'll hide myself; And listen to discover if I can Whether this other doth maintain his purpose. SCENE THE THIRD. Garcia. Gar. Alas! who doth impel my footsteps here? ... Where am I? ... This is most assuredly The cave of death. For a most noble combat, In truth, oh Garcia, thou preparest thyself. Oh heaven! what am I doing? Innocence, Thou which wert heretofore my only boast, Thou art no longer mine: the impious blow I've pledged myself to strike ... and shall I strike it? ... In every corner of this gloomy cave I hear a sound of death: and on myself Alone I cannot now that death inflict. ... Oh cruel destiny! ... Night's thickest shades Already cover all things; and 'tis come, Nay, 'tis exceeded, the tremendous hour!â Assuredly Piero did dispatch The messenger of death: why should I doubt? Did Piero e'er delay to do a thing That might endanger others? The embassy, Too certainly was sent! ... Unhappy friend! Thou with security awaitest me, In the impious cave, destined to be thy tomb ... Thy tomb? ... Shall I destroy thee? Never, never. Why do I grasp thee, hated sword of Cosmo? Far from me, cursed instrument! ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Eleonora, Garcia. Ele. Oh son! ... Gar. Mother, whence comest thou? To rescue me From this commanded crime? Ele. Oh heaven! To thee Thy cruel father sends me. Gar. What wills he? Ele. That I should come, alas! to ascertain With these my eyes, if thou prepare thyself To obey him. This abominable task Belong'd to Piero; but he found him not; Hence he chose me ... Alas! and I to him Am instantly commanded to return. What shall I say to him? Gar. That hitherto My hands are pure: ah, that my lips were so! But, if I promised it, I now refuse That promise to fulfil. Go, tell him this ... Ele. Oh heaven! Dost thou not know, if I should dare To repeat this to him, I should expose thee To dreadful danger? He is blind with rage ... Gar. Let him be so; and let him murder me; This I expect. Ele. And Julia? Gar. Oh that name! ... Ele. Take pity on her, if thou do refuse it Both to thy wretched mother and thyself. Gar. Go then, and say to him, ... that I obey: Meanwhile without delay my Julia rescue ... Ele. Rescue! Does Cosmo trust to simple words? He, with his own eyes, here will see the victim. Ah son! it tortures me to goad thee thus To an unworthy deed; ... but yet, ... reflect ... Gar. Is it impossible that Julia then ... Ele. I dare not tell thee all; ... yet, if I'm silent ... Gar. Speak, mother, speak at once. Thou mak'st me tremble. Ele. While I confer with thee, ... Cosmo himself ... Holds o'er the bosom of the trembling maid An unsheathed dagger ... Gar. Oh atrocious sight! Stop, father, stop thy aim; I will destroy him; ... I return quickly; ... stop; ... thou shalt behold me Swimming in blood ... Where is my sword, my sword? ... 'Tis here; I fly ... Oh father ... stop ... I fly. SCENE THE FIFTH. Piero. Pi. Oh thou disciple of romantic virtue, Dost thou too tread expediency's broad path? It were indeed a miracle, hadst thou Belied the character of all our race!â Now go, and plunge thou in a guiltless breast Thy reeking dagger.âWhat will thence ensue? I do not know; but be it what it may, The inextricable knot, which chance and art Have emulously twined, the sword alone Can disentangle.âLet us hear ... But what? Do I hear Garcia return already? He returns quickly. Should he have repented? It is not, is not so; for I behold him Come like a man whom conscious guilt pursues. SCENE THE SIXTH. Garcia, Piero. Gar. Who art thou? ... Who ... presents himself to me ... Upon the thresholds of mortality? Pi. Thy brother, Piero ... Gar. The son of Cosmo? Pi. And thou, art thou not so? Gar. I am so, ... yes ... Now that I am a traitor. Pi. Hast thou slain him? Gar. Dost thou not see it, by my steps, ... my gestures, ... My faultering voice, ... the unaccustomed fear ... Which smites my heart? Pi. I pitied thee before, And now much more.âBut thou hast saved thy Julia. Gar. Oh heaven! who knows if yet my father ... Pi. Hence I fly to him. Soon as I bring to him Proof that by thy hand Salviati fell, Julia will be in safety. Gar. Proof? Behold My sword; it trickles yet with smoking blood. Go, take it to him ... but if it should meet His daughter's eyes, ... oh heaven! ... Pi. But art thou sure Thou tookest aim effectively? Fell he At the first blow? And spake he not? Gar. Fear'st thou That yet he is alive? Or doth it please thee To hear from me the atrocious narrative, To fill thy bosom with malignant joy? Thou shalt be satisfied: and tell it thou To my unnatural father.â Soon as I enter'd in the cave I heard, And seem'd to see, my victim groping there, Who had preceded me: I quickly raised My arm to smite him; but my arm dropped down ... Already I retreated; when, methought, A shriek from Julia, like a shriek of death, I heard, and spite of me it drew me back. Hearing a foot-fall, Salviati rush'd Meanwhile towards the entrance, and approach'd me. At once I planted, even to the hilt, The execrable dagger in his heart ... One sigh alone, one bursting sigh of death, Falling, he breathed ... Oh horrible to tell! ... I felt myself aspersed with spouting blood: A death-like chillness crept through all my veins; ... And scarcely I restrain'd myself from falling Upon the bleeding corse ... Wretch that I am! ... Groping with trembling hands, I scarcely gain'd The mouth of that abominable tomb ... Hast heard enough?âDost thou exult in hearing? Pi. Why should'st thou wrong me thus?âFortune at least, In one respect, has been to thee propitious, That I alone beheld thee quit this cave.â My father will hereafter well know how To give what colour serves his purpose best To this calamity. Time cancels all things; Even affliction yields at length to time. If thus my father will'd, the guilt is his: Thanks, not dishonour, thou should'st reap from it. Besides, that he especially will wish For ever to conceal it.âCalm thyself: Light is a crime that ne'er will be divulged. Gar. Rewards to me!âdeath now is my desert. Where shall I hide myself? This guiltless blood, With which I am polluted and besmear'd, What could e'er cleanse it? Not my useless tears, Nor the last drop of all my blood could do it.â Go thou to Cosmo; yield him back his sword; Do thou receive his recompenses. Thou The cruel messenger of death didst send: Thou didst exult, perfidious brother! thou, That I became, as thou thyself art, base And infamous.âThou art the real son Of Cosmo.âGo; this instant leave me.âWhere, Where can I ever from myself escape? ... Where shall I hide myself? ... Ah! how shall I Sustain the glances of Diego now, Now that he's justified in calling me A traitor?âof Diego, who, though dear To you, had never been himself a traitor? ... Oh rage! ... Oh irrecoverable shame! ... Pi. Thou canst not instantaneously resume Collected thoughts ... Appease thy just regrets: Meanwhile I will precede thee to thy father. I hope thy crime will always be unknown Both to Diego and to all mankind. Gar. All men shall know it: such a punishment I have already to myself prescribed, That false suspicion may not fall on others. Obtain alone that I, on my arrival, Find that unhappy Julia restored To liberty ... It afterwards depends On me to inflict just vengeance on my crime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Cosmo, Garcia. Cos. Advance, nearer advance. But how! thou tremblest! Dost thou deserve reward or punishment? What hast thou done? This instant tell me all. Gar. Before to-day didst thou e'er see me tremble? Thou oughtest to be well aware how fear Ever accompanies a guilty conscience. My brief address, oh Cosmo, hear. At length I have, thou knowest, with my dastard hand Accomplish'd thy magnanimous revenge, And I was taught to expect that Julia's safety Would recompense the murderer of her father. For thou erewhile didst generously promise That I should purchase by the blood of one The freedom of another innocent. Ah! tell me, hast thou then at last released Julia from chains? Shall that most wretched maid Life and security at least retain? Cos. Not only I release her, but with thee Will join her, if thou hast perform'd the deed. Gar. Join her with me! oh crime And thinkest thou That I am so consummately thy son I am thy son indeed, but not so much. If I have been a traitor, heaven know wherefore ... Cos. Thou better know'st thyself. But whence are now Thy mad audacity, thy pride, thy threats, In thee redoubled? Gar. Whence! Defiled with blood, I am the instrument of thy commands, And should I not be swoln with haughty thoughts? Since I am the most guilty, am I not Now the most dear to thee of all thy sons? Cos. Miscreant! ere long and thou indeed wilt tremble ... Gar. I trembled while I yet was innocent: Now am I reckless from despairing guilt. I only ask of thee that thou would'st now Fulfil thy promise. My own destiny I have ere now fix'd, and for ever fix'd. Cos. More fix'd perchance my will. She ne'er shall be Released, if she is not thy consort first: Or thine or in eternal chains. Shall I Suffer her ancient rancour, her new wish To avenge her father's murder, to be brought A wedding dowry to another spouse? Her's thou alone ... Gar. Ah me! what have I done? ... Oh what art thou? ... No ... never ... Cos. Cease; this ought Not to afflict thee now: thou'rt call'd upon First to convince me that with thy own hand Thou hast slain Salviati.âKnow'st thou this? What proofs of it canst thou adduce to me? Gar. What proofs! Oh guilty grief! doth it not then Suffice to be a miscreant? Is there need Also to triumph in committed crimes? Ah, see my guilt upon my face engraved, See it exultingly. My desperate deeds, My eyes, my gestures, and the tones of death Most audible in every word I utter, Do not they all express it? And the blood With which I am defiled from head to foot, Yet crimson, smoking yet? Cos. I see that blood: But whose it is I have not yet discover'd. I only have obtain'd entire conviction That it is not the blood that I demanded. Gar. Oh rage! and doubt? ... Then thither go thyself: Plant thou thy feet within the horrible cave; That wretched victim in a lake of blood There wilt thou see extended. Go, and feed On the dire spectacle; go satisfy Not thy sight only, but thy other senses: Touch with thy hand the gaping wound of death; Feed on his quivering heart; and, tyger, drink In copious draughts its blood; thy regal rage Pour out on that exanimated breast. Once, twice, and four times, nay, a thousand times, Plunge in that form that can contend no more Thy valorous dagger: there make noble proof Of all thy prowess,âsceptred heroâthere; Thou hast no other place.âUnheard-of death! Unheard-of pangs! I am a parricide, The son of Cosmo, I; and innocent That Cosmo would account me! ... Cos. Who denies That thou'rt a miscreant, who? Thou hast, I think, Inflicted death; but not on him whose death, From the complexion of these perilous times, Is no less indispensable than just. Thou art, but not of any foe of mine, A murderer: more I know not; but ere long I shall know all; quickly I shall behold With my own eyes ... Gar. Hast thou not seen Piero? And said he not to thee that Salviati, By his contrivance, enter'd first the cave? ... Cos. Yes, yes, Piero came, and said to me That Salviati in that cave this night Hath never enter'd, nor e'en thought to do it. Thither I now repair, where thou hast stain'd The soil with blood. If he has not fall'n there, Tremble thyself. My fury, destined all To wreak itself on that devoted head, Who knows, perchance ... to-day ... may elsewhere ... fall ... SCENE THE SECOND. Garcia. Gar. What do I hear? Oh heaven! that in that cave The feet of Salviati have not enter'd! Piero says so! and to Cosmo says it! Oh horrible and fatal mystery! Whose is that blood then that I thus have shed? Oh how I shudder with affright! ... But yet, What other murder were a crime like this? Ah! were it true that this my impious hand Had slain all others rather than himself! ... Whom hast thou then destroy'd? ... I well remember, That when I issued breathless from the cave Piero stood before me suddenly, With hesitating looks ... What did he say? Oh, well I recollect; ... he was disturb'd, And manifested great anxiety To hear my narrative: for me he waited: His words were broken, doubtful, apprehensive ... Nor Salviati's danger, nor my own, Could ever wake in him such agony ... Perhaps he himself within that grot had laid Some snare for my destruction! ... Yet the man Whom I transfix'd appear'd to me unarm'd. I was the first to assault him: he spake not ... What boots it? ... More obscure than threefold night, Who, except Cosmo or Piero, can Unravel thee, thou horrid mystery? But more and more I feel myself o'erwhelm'd With unaccustom'd fear: within my heart An unknown terror rises.âOh suspense, Oh thou the chief and worst of ills, no more, No more thy torments will I thus embosom! Thither I go; thither I go myself, To see what death ... SCENE THE THIRD. Eleonora, Garcia. Ele. Oh son! what hast thou done? Fly hence ... ah fly! ... Gar. Fly! ... I! ... and wherefore? whither? Ele. Fly, fly, oh son! ... Gar. Ah no! I will not fly. My father, on my ruin bent, contrived The crime, whate'er it be. I fly not, no. Ele. Ah! if thou carest for thyself, for us, For me, withdraw thyself without delay From the first violence of thy father's fury. Gar. Fury! what have I done? and what can add Force to his natural ferocity? Ele. Hear'st thou?âOn every side with piercing cries The palace echoes.âWhat canst thou have done? Preceded by a hundred torches, Cosmo Enraged within the grotto ran; in arms Others pursued him: all at once cried out The name of Garcia. What canst thou have done? Thou know'st him well; ah fly!âOh heaven! he comes! What stunning clamour! Didst thou hear the cry? âTreason! and to the traitor!â ... Oh my son! Gar. The treason is from Cosmo; Cosmo is The traitor; but I'm doom'd to be the victim; I have deserved it. Let him come; I fear not. Ele. Ah wretched me! with sword unsheath'd ... At least Shelter in these my arms ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Eleonora, Garcia, Cosmo, with naked Sword, Guards with Torches and Arms. Cos. On every side Close up the avenues.âWhere is the traitor? Slunk to his mother's arms. In vain ... Gar. From thence I've freed myself. What wouldest thou with me? What have I done? Ele. Pity! thou art a father ... Cos. I was so once. Ele. Oh heavens! ... Gar. What have I done? Cos. Askest thou that, when thou hast slain Diego? Ele. My son! ... Gar. My brother! ... Cos. Lady, get thee hence ... Ele. Yet he's thy son ... Gar. Behold my breast ... Ele. Ah! pause ... Cos. Die! die! Ele. Thy son! ... Oh blow! She falls in a swoon. ... Cos. Impious! is he To thee a son, he who hath slain a son? Gar. We all ... are impious ... Never did the day Visit a more flagitious race than ours.â Father ... I swear to thee ... I knew it not ... If ... by this hand of mine ... Diego fell, Piero ... plann'd ... the execrable scheme. Father ... I ... die ... and dying ... I invoke ... The heavens ... to witness ... that ... I speak the truth. Cos. Beloved Diego! I lose thee! ... Oh heavens! ... And in the life-blood of another son I've bathed this dagger! In the arms of death My consort lies: ... on my remaining son Frightful suspicions fall ... Oh state! ... To whom Can I now turn? ... Alas! ... In whom confide?</field>
