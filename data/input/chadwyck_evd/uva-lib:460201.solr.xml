      <field name="fulltext">THE HEROINE of the CAVE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">?Nox atra cavâ circumvolat umbrâ. O digno conjuncta Viro! Tu ne cede malis; sed contrà audentior ito Quàm tua te Fortuna sinet. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO ALL VIRTUOUS WIVES. The following finished Pattern of conubial Attachment, and heroic Exertions of true and becoming female Fortitude are most respectfully dedicated, by Their most obedient and Humble Servant, PAUL HIFFERNAN, M.D.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The late Mr. Henry Jones, author of the now acted Earl of Essex, and several other poetical productions, had left in the hands of Mr. Reddish, a very affecting piece in three acts, call'd The Cave of Idra, founded on a narrative in the Annual Register.—It was, according to his composition, all under ground, which gave to it a tiresome and disgusting monotony, unfit for a stage representation. A conviction of this obvious and striking defect, induced Mr. Reddish, (and this application gave being to the present drama,) to submit it to the inspection of, for a new moulding, and amplifying of the subject by Dr. Hiffernan, author of an Essay on Dramatic Genius. He determined to encrease the number of characters, which in the original were only Alberti, Constantia, Lorenzo, Everard, Faulkner, Clermont, and the Jailor.—He next broke through the ensabling uniformity of a continued, subterraneous gloomy scene, and from time to time, admitted, upon what otherwise would prove a moped audience, the chearing light of day.—In short, all the underground part, except the solemn hymn, which closes the second act, and the slave Clermont's exit speech in act third, are Mr. Jones's; in which, are many instances of the true pathetic, and poetically sublime, that would do honour to the foremost pens that have ever written for the Theatre.— Dr. Hiffernan's additional improvements to this piece, consist in adding several new characters to the above.—The first and fifth acts are entirely his; and the beginning of the second, till Constantia goes off from Vienna; as, are also, the first scenes of the third act, and of the fourth act.—In fine, all the under-ground scenes, except, as already premised, were composed by the deceased author; and all the above-ground, with the Prologue and Epilogue, by the living.—This Tragedy was acted for the first time, on Saturday, March 19th, 1774, for the benefit of Mr. Reddish, at the Theatre-Royal of Drury-Lane; and, was three times performed, last summer, on the Bristol Theatre, with repeated applause. In regard to the performers, Mr. Reddish acquitted himself with the most critical propriety, with just dramatic energy, and throughout the part of Alberti, appeared a more consummate actor, than in any other character he hath as yet performed.—Miss Younge has, in Constantia, so far tower'd above her usual excelling, that it will be dangerous for any but a capital actress to undertake, or hope to be endured in this character after her.—The parts of less importance, were, be it said, to the credit of the several actors, well and judiciously represented: Mr. Cautherly's was most happily suited to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. REDDISH. Prologues in gen'ral are a kind salute, Hoping the author's work your taste may suit; And if so lucky as to 'scape your frown, He struts the fav'rite poet of the town: Thanking dame Nature that has been so kind T'endow him with a more Parnassian mind, Than shines in dramas of his dull compeers, Whom in news-paragraphs he slily fleers.— Licentious vehicles of gross abuse, That, snakes—(anonymous) each day let loose; Sparing nor birth, nor worth, nor high degree, Their venom dart at all—nay, ev'n so low as me! If 'cause my efforts, to approve, you deign; I'll be more guilty,—still encrease their pain; New whet their rancour—more provoke their sallies, If you're my patrons, need I dread their malice? Now from the actor to the author turn, Whose proud ideas with vain-glory burn; Declaring, loth to praise, but prone to slight, “No!—We're but few now qualified to write, “What numbers scribble in Apollo's spite! “Had the dull fellow shewn his play to me, “I had giv'n't life, at least in some degree, “And made it crawl out nights, to three times three.” But if a piece of his in turn shou'd fail, How chang'd his tone, how bitter does he rail! Swears, as away he pen, ink, paper flings, There is no certainty in human things!— Yet here, success or failure oft proceeds, Not from fair judgment, but unmanly deeds, Of vi'lent parties, forming a cabal, The one to raise—the other to appal! Men hir'd to roar out prostituted praise— And honour dulness with an ideot gaze! Yet still more shameful, who through selfish ends Of foes malignant,—or of jealous friends, Waiting the signal, in dark ambush sit, To act the worst of murders,—that of wit! None such we trust are here!—but if there shou'd, They'll by a candid audience be withstood. Cruel oppression shocks an English ear; From your known equity we banish fear!— The leading author of our scenes to-night, Has been long since remov'd from either plight. Out of the reach of censure or applause, He'll tremble not, as up the curtain draws. This tribute to his muse, let Essex plead, A farewel sprig of laurel round his head, Nor hate, nor envy combat with the dead!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Prime Minister's House. SEYFERT. BURMAN at a Distance. SEYFERT. Revenge, thou art the deity I adore!— From thy auspicious shrine I hope a cure For the corroding pain that rends my heart. The vain Alberti being thus preferr'd By fair Constantia, passeth all enduring! Colredo I have rouz'd—Another wooer— And in his name are such reflections dropp'd, As 'twixt the two a duel must provoke— My purpose is, whoe'er the conqu'ror be, To reap advantage for my private views. If that Colredo triumph o'er Alberti, I to his widow will renew my suit— Or, if Alberti should dispatch Colredo, I'll so possess th'imperial ear against him, As that immediate sentence shall take place, Death, or imprisonment in Idra's Cave; Where he'll not deign to eke out life in toil, But soon emancipate his soul for higher worlds— Burman approach!—And this your task fulfil. Since you have learn'd the place where they're to meet, Range near the choicest of my men conceal'd, To carry of the slain or hurt Colredo— Around, place guards disguis'd to seize Alberti. Such are the orders from above receiv'd— The cogent reasons you shall know hereafter; Be quick—be diligent—and hope to rise!— BURMAN. In this, as all things, I shall prove my zeal. SEYFERT. I know thou wilt, from long experienc'd truth. [Exit Burman. I have so plann'd I think I must succeed— Unless capricious fortune war against me— I'll to the Emperor—and prepare him for the event. [Exit. SCENE II. Rampart of Vienna near the Gate of the City. Count ALBERTI and RODOLPHO. ALBERTI. No more, Rodolpho—Strive with efforts vain To warp me from the purpose of my soul; That's fix'd! unalterable! as the stamp of fate— RODOLPHO. But, Sir, consider with what danger's fraught Thy desperate resolve, to act against The imperial mandate of our gracious sovereign, Who'll ne'er forgive thy disobedient rage. 'Tis friendship speaks, and reason backs my zeal. ALBERTI. I love thy friendship—but to reason's call Am now reluctant; nor will hear her voice— The die is thrown; and one or both must perish; Thy friend, or fortune's minion in Colredo.— Oh! 'tis an insult manhood cannot pardon; No, none but such as wear its coward form Void of all impulse from a noble heart. RODOLPHO. Yet, Sir, if what's the fountain of our honour Call'd, and rever'd, doth specially forbid Our farther process in attaints of glory, And takes upon itself the event of all, I mean the Emperor's supreme command; Then sure no stain from dutiful submission Can e'er arise—That from the charge of shame Absolves—and reconciles us to ourselvs again. ALBERTI. Such doctrine may be fit for vulgar minds, But cannot suit the swellings of a soul That in my sovereign's cause hath never fail'd To act the foremost in the ranks of danger— And shall it prove a recreant in my own? Yes, proud Vienna!—oft with thankful hymns Your churches rung for conquests I had won; And through your streets loud acclamations ran, As in triumphant march I pass'd along, To hail me fav'rite of the throne and people. RODOLPHO. And such you still may prove—suppress this wrath, And bind your sovereign more by mild complying; 'Twill win new favours, and defeat the malice Of your combin'd, your secret foes—but chiefly Seyfert's—than whom a darker villain never breath'd. ALBERTI. I know him well—great artist in deceiving, Train'd up in all the subtleties of courts, And policy's mean, cringing, base devices, He can convert to a friendly smiling look His Protean features on the man he hates; Oh! that such monsters shou'd debase our kind! RODOLPHO. He'll be the first t'exaggerate the crime Of thy transgressing monarchy's command, Which he'll not fail with ev'ry art to paint In the most odious, most offensive light, T'obtain thy exile or inglorious punishment. ALBERTI. Yet he's the very engine of this quarrel Started between Colredo and myself; Through various hints by his low creatures dropp'd, From th'ancient grudge that twixt our houses rag'd, H' has hurried both from means of reconcilement; At least on my side—blood must be the consequence— Now is the hour I've dar'd him to a meeting, His sword 'gainst mine to terminate the fray. RODOLPHO. (holding him) Stop—and attend Rodolpho's last request! Since pow'r's high mandate, or the voice of friendship, Can't turn thy soul from its determin'd purpose To fall or conquer, in this test of manhood— Consider, Sir, if fate should adverse prove, And rob the world of thy illustrious life, What must th'affliction of Constantia be? Constantia! foremost of Vienna's dames! Constantia! woo'd by all our German princes! Who to Alberti gave a preference; That made him envied by the great and brave. More wou'd I say—but anguish stops my words— And stealing tears supply my want of speech! ALBERTI. Rodolpho!—hold!—appear not thus unman'd; No heart more tender, and no arm more brave, Than I have always known this man's to be! The dangerous infection gains upon me— I must defeat it e'er it be too late!— Hear, and observe Alberti's strict command; His last perhaps—And with it take this last Embrace—Be not seen near the place of combat, Lest in my peril you shou'd be involv'd. RODOLPHO. I care not for my life if thou shou'd'st fall, But Constantia!— ALBERTI. Oh! that name distracts me! And raises a new tempest in my soul! If from my fate Constantia prove a widow, (She'll be expos'd again to a siege of wooers Whom she repuls'd thro' virtuous dislike) And all her days in bitterness must pass— Or, if I decline t'assert her innocence, The sland'rous whisp'ring of Colredo's faction, Will through Vienna, o'er the empire spread With an implicit charge of cowardice. Hell's in that thought—Constantia must reject me, As a reproach to her too partial choice, For one who dared not vindicate her name.— Pride—glory, fame, ambition, love rise up In mutinous array to urge me on. [Rodolpho offers to speak. 'Tis now no time for thought, blow winds—drive storm, What honor dictates, courage shall perform. [Exit Alberti. RODOLPHO. (alone.) How this unhappy man to ruin hastes! Nor heeds the admonition of a friend! Nor tend'rest passion for the best of wives! Once disobedient to Alberti's order, [Pausing. I'll after, and, at distance, wait th'event— If slain, his body will inter in private; Or if victorious, aid him in his flight. [Exit Rodolpho. SCENE III. A Square in the City, and Place of general Rendezvous.— LORENZO and MENTZEL meeting. LORENZO. Mentzel well met, and at th'appointed place For all my zealous messengers to come, And bring report if brave Alberti's sword Shall on this day another conquest gain; Or in a bold encounter with Colredo, Shall for the first time suffer a defeat. MENTZEL. 'Twill be thought more than bold, rebellious deem'd, To force Colredo 'gainst our sov'reign's mandate To such forbidden act of violence— Good Heav'n! that passion can so far prevail On the all-polish'd temper of Alberti, Thus obstinate to seek another's fall!— LORENZO. Alas! thou little know'st the grating cause That irritates his soul to noble vengeance: Had he declin'd, I, must wipe off the stain Which vain Colredo cast upon us both. MENTZEL. In what, my Lord, or how? Your words amaze me, Nor can I well interpret what they mean, But just returned to Vienna's court, From regimental duty that had call'd To a far distant province—You'll excuse me, An ignorance of most transactions here. LORENZO. I do most frankly—will succinctly tell The origin of this dire altercation. Between Colredo and the Count Alberti, Men once in friendship link'd, and two the most Of all our German officers renown'd For courtly polish, and heroic prowess, With other lords of court they woo'd my sister, Constantia, reigning beauty of the time. She to Alberti's vows alone prov'd kind, And made a virtuous choice of him for husband; For which she had my warm approving voice: That stung Colredo's overbearing pride To terms of most outrageous insult. MENTZEL. There's some excuse for disappointed love, Whose rage oft hurries to unguarded words That calm returning reason blushes for. LORENZO. Granted—in many cases—but not when They tend to blast a noble house's fame With such foul hints—as if Alberti had Obtain'd a favour 'fore the marriage rites. The which, I knowing, dar'd not to resent, And act an honourable brother's part. MENTZEL. That's gross, and casts forgiveness at defiance; Too plain I see that one or both must perish. LORENZO. I meant to first engage; Alberti stop'd, And said, as husband, that the right was his. But who hastes hither?—Anxious, out of breath? One of my zealous emissaries—Say— Did you soon find the place where they agreed To meet? And know'st thou aught of what is pass'd? MESSENGER. Colredo, Sir, is fall'n.—Alberti triumphs. LORENZO. I ask no more—Come, Sir.—Be you our guide. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An Apartment in ALBERTI's House. CONSTANTIA. Where is my husband?—Where is my Alberti? What cause so early from his bed cou'd rouze, And make him rush forth, with impatient speed? Something I fear of dangerous intent Hangs brooding o'er his mind—for all the night, In broken slumbers, sighing did he pass, With frequent invocation of my name. “Constantia, frail. Colredo, thou art false.” The repetition of those words alarm'd me, And when awaken'd by returning morn, I hop'd from him the unravelling to hear.— But e'er my senses from the bonds of sleep 'Woke to the social offices of life, Alberti was gone forth! What must I think? Enter LAURA. Madam, this letter did my master give With strictest charge of laying it before you, On your uprising, at whatever hour; But not to hasten't—by imprudent zeal. CONSTANTIA. Ah me! I dread to take it from her hand! My courage fails me to break ope the seal: I pray you will, and read the dire contents! For such, my throbbing breast anticipates. LAURA reads the Letter. “Madam, “Colredo has reflected on your honour, “Your spotless innocence; your virgin fame “His sland'rous tongue has wantonly revil'd.— “This morn he answers for the base attempt, “And shou'd his luckier stars prevail o'er mine, “Act like thyself; thou wert Alberti's wife.” CONSTANTIA. (pausing.) How cou'd he doubt?—Give me the letter, Laura— The last perhaps I shall receive from him! Why drops these woman's tears as I peruse it? Come, let me place thee near this faithful heart As the last will of an expiring hero! [Puts the letter in her bosom. Enter the SERVANT. Madam, the Lord Rodolpho earnest waits— CONSTANTIA. Admit him.— Welcome, Rodolpho! my Alberti's friend! I have been told the purpose of the day. Say, what's th'event?—Is't for, or makes against us? RODOLPHO. In part 'tis for, in part against us, Lady! CONSTANTIA. In part against!—Oh, does Alberti live? If wounded! let me fly to his assistance.— RODOLPHO. My friend, your Lord, the courteous, brave Alberti Soon made Colredo fall beneath his sword— He straight was bleeding carried off the field By Seyfert's creatures, screen'd around on purpose; As were the guards, to seize upon Alberti If he shou'd victor prove, the other slain; And be for disobedience, and the crime Of murder, t'Idra's dreary cave convey'd; No ear for mercy left, to gain his pardon. Your brother, and the nobles of his party Are to the court repair'd, to try all means, If not an absolute release to win, At least some mitigation to obtain From a fell sentence that is worse than death. Thither I've promis'd all my friends to bring, When I the tidings shou'd have borne to thee Of what was pass'd, and meant yet to be done. CONSTANTIA. Haste thee, Rodolpho, with the speed of friendship. RODOLPHO. I fly on friendship's wing to save my friend. CONSTANTIA. Now duty calls that I assert myself, And prove I'm worthy of Alberti's love!— [After a pause. I'll go and rouse up every virtuous wife, Each noble matron, and each blooming maid Within Vienna's walls; aloud make known The wrong that's done them in Alberti's fall! Shou'd supplication meet with disregard, From the obdurate heart of worldly pow'r, For intercession with th'almighty Being, I'll make my last appeal to pitying saints: Earth, air, and heav'n shall ring with my complaints. [Exit. SCENE V. The Road from Vienna. A Colonel, with subaltern Officers, and a Corps of Soldiers. ALBERTI in the Middle a Prisoner. COLONEL. Here do we halt, and my commission ends— To me a most unwelcome one!—from us You pass to th'common instruments of justice, That the condemn'd to Idra's Cave convey. [They appear at the side. We all lament, great Sir, thy hapless fate! Lo! ev'n the rabble weep for your disaster! ALBERTI. Next to a people's praise for deeds of glory, Is to be wept for in the frowns of fortune. Thanks; thanks to all:—who will be vain hereafter?— [After a Pause. That e'er Alberti shou'd be brought to this! In chains! condemn'd to galling infamy! He who has made the Austrian Eagle soar; And clap triumphant wings on hostile tow'rs! And taught their troops the art of victory! Now all his laurels wither'd in their bloom Beholds! (himself yet in the prime of life) 'Tis terrible!—but manhood bear me up! COLONEL. How moving, Sirs, in such a plight to see The chief whom we've all gloried to obey. ALBERTI. Through what refinement of barbarity Am I refus'd th'attendance of a friend To see me to my melancholy gaol!— And why refus'd a parting interview, To give a last embrace to my Constantia! Oh! there I suffer!—Every fibre shrinks! My blood recoils! and all my spirits fail At the dire thought of what she now must feel: I hear her groans; they rend my tortur'd soul! COLONEL. Despair not, Sir! for, soon relenting pow'r Will change its too severe decree, to mercy. Some latent viper is the cause of all. ALBERTI. Despair's a word, a soldier ne'er shou'd know— [pauses. For honour's idol I have done too much; Now let the Christian hero in me rise: That in adversity still greater shews Than midst th'applauding of victorious troops— [kneels. Divine example! how to suffer wrong! And pardon those who injure us the most! Stretch thy compassion to the fall'n Alberti. Deign to support him in this heavy hour, Let him not sink beneath calamity. Since greatest empires perish at thy nod, Let suff'ring mortals kiss affliction's rod: In all resign'd to thee, my Saviour, and my God! END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Street near the Palace. RODOLPHO and MENTZEL. MENTZEL. Oh! how I suffer for Constantia's sake; I tremble, lest some fatal error shou'd ensue. RODOLPHO. All future ages must applauding hear When the brave Count, her husband, hence was forc'd By rigid sentence to the Cave of Idra— A torpid interval numb'd every sense, And all the wheels of life a while stood still; But bounteous Nature soon reviv'd their springs: Then all the horrors of her dread condition Rush'd ghastly—glaring on her tortur'd soul. MENTZEL. At such a sight, humanity must shudder! RODOLPHO. No words can utter what her heart endur'd Beneath th'impression of the horrid blow: She flew to court to plead her husband's cause; Her language such as guardian angels utter, Who pray for mortals at the throne of grace. MENTZEL. And yet, alas! she met not with success! Where was Lorenzo then to back her suit? RODOLPHO. The insolence of Seyfert had provok'd His gen'rous nature up to such degree, His friends by force withdrew him from the court, Lest his too warm resentment shou'd incur A treatment base as Count Alberti has;— But let us seek and strive to comfort him. [Exeunt. SCENE II. ALBERTI'S House. CONSTANTIA and LAURA. LAURA. Madam, for Heav'n sake moderate your grief! Nor let fierce anger prey upon your mind! With patience wait; a retributive hour Will amply pay the agonies you feel. CONSTANTIA. Preach patience to the winds—to roaring seas, But not to me!—Comfort I ne'er shall know; Its healing balm disclaims a wretch like me: A wretch who caus'd the noblest hero's fall That e'er with bold atchievements grac'd the field; For me he's lost, my honour to assert! Oh! there's distraction in the horrid thought! It kindles a new Etna in my bosom, And drives me mad! a prey to wild despair! LAURA. Good angels calm the tempest in her heart! CONSTANTIA. How!—be refus'd a common suppliant's right! Admittance, and a hearing from my prince! In the behalf of his most gallant chief! To be debarr'd from bidding him adieu! And taking a last farewel kind embrace! This to the wives of criminals they grant: Why am I singled out for such disgrace! Th'affront is meant to me—thro' Seyfert's malice: He may afflict—but ne'er shall bend my soul!— Enter SERVANT, SERVANT. Madam, this paper's from Lord Seyfert brought. CONSTANTIA, How! from Lord Seyfert!—it can bode no good, But I will read—whatever the contents. “To Lady Constantia.” “It is commanded by th'imperial will, “That in her house Constantia be confin'd, “And dare not zealous application make “In vain behalf of the condemn'd Alberti. “Shou'd she repugnant prove to this decree, “The Emperor commands without appeal, “She forthwith to a convent be convey'd, “In its sequester'd gloom to end her days.” LEOPOLD. SEYFERT. Vain threats to one who's fix'd, resolv'd, already; [Throws down the paper—Laura takes it up. I'll fly this town where tyranny resides, To find a speedy death, or my Alberti— Relentless holder of an iron sceptre, In the last moments of thy cruel life, May th'ear of Heav'n prove deaf as thine to pity— And barr'd against you be the door of mercy! But in this world to punish lawless pow'r, May ceaseless thunder bellow round your walls; May the keen light'nings shoot in vollies down, And of your city make one gen'ral blaze! At which my soul will feel luxurious joy— When all Vienna is reduc'd to ashes, Rise! swell! O Danube from thy lowest bed, And with a foamy torrent sweep away, That not a relique of its pride remain To tell posterity that such things were. LAURA. Alas! her reason's gone, and madness now prevails! CONSTANTIA. Come! let us hasten from these hated walls, And e'er their ranc'rous hate prevent my flight, I'll mounted on a whirlwind's friendly wing O'ertake Alberti, who's the world to me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Cave in the Quicksilver Mines of Idra. Enter EVERARD and FAULKNER—lighted by a SLAVE. EVERARD. In all our travels thro' the eastern world, No sight of greater wonder or dismay E'er struck our eyes than this of Idra's cave! Of all whose horrors I'll a picture just Give to Alberti, near th'imperial throne The foremost courtier, my much honour'd friend.— What horrors strike me in this hideous path That leads directly to the door of death? My frighted senses have their functions lost! My eyes, my ears, my feeling, and my judgment, Are robb'd of their accustomed faculties; Nay, startled nature knows not here her own Establish'd laws! a hollow dreadful chaos! SLAVE. Ah! Sir, what think you then of us? Condemn'd For life to groan in these infernal cells, And never more to see the radiant sun? EVERARD. Can human hearts impose on fellow creatures Such a curse? SLAVE. Ah, Sir! you see but little yet of what We miserable wretches here endure. FAULKNER. What, are you here condemn'd to groan out life For some atrocious crime? If so, sure death To you and all wou'd be a welcome mercy. SLAVE. I ought, alas! but wretched mortals, Sir, Will cling to nature, tho' she spurn them from her: For crimes indeed, but disproportion'd crimes Are many to this horrid cave condemn'd. EVERARD. Oh, tyranny! thou horrid, hateful pest! Who gratifiest thy appetite of death. With sights like these, and glut'st on misery! My free-born nature startles at thy shape! Oh, dear bought precious, precious liberty! I taste thy heav'n descended cordial now! Now, now, my happy country's name adore!— Oh, blissful Britain! little do thy sons Regard th'inestimable privilege That they enjoy above the rest of mortals! Their birthright, Liberty! that glorious claim; That joy of reason! and that pride of man! FAULKNER. Say, finish'd ruin of thy former state, Oh, say! wou'd not a speedy death be welcome? SLAVE. Indeed, good Sir, I felt it so at first, And often call'd on death to set me free. But thanks to Heav'n, whose wise, whose gracious ways To human search are past the finding out. My better angel, watchful at my side, Still whisper'd messages of grace and love, And pull'd my lifted arm with sweet persuasion down. FAULKNER. Can then such manly sentiments remain, Such eloquence within a heart like thine? My impatient soul with eager longing pants To hear thy cruel fate! Say whence you came, Your rank, and what misfortune brought you hither. (Enter an Officer from the Cave.) OFFICER. Get hence unto thy task thou talking loiterer, Thy time is not thine own, the breath thou draw'st Belongs not to thyself, but to the Emperor: Thou canst not long hold out—thy time is near; Get hence thou slave! and work it to the last. EVERARD. Say, wretch, art thou of human clay compos'd? Has custom turn'd to flint thy harden'd heart? Forbear thy hateful hand—there's money for thee. OFFICER. Oh! Sir, you know, I see, the way to melt me. Flinty as I am, Sir, this shall soften me. Preach on, preach on, but make thy sermon short; I shall not be thy hearer yet a while— [Exit. SLAVE. Such are the hourly insults which we here Endure; but thanks to Heav'n they'll quickly cease! I feel my spirits fail, they bring me news That weary life and I shall quickly part! FAULKNER. I pray, good Sir, indulge us with your story: I long to hear it, and perhaps may serve thee. SLAVE. Fain wou'd I gratify thy friendly wish, Thou gen'rous man! and tell thee my sad tale: But, oh! the retrospect severe will wound me! Yet bear my bitter narrative with patience, And pity the disasters thou shalt hear! My country, France; my rank, a gentleman! An unadvis'd, a hasty rash adventure Expell'd me from my native soil for ever: Hither I fled, and serv'd a while the Emperor, But, oh! the agonizing thought that shall For ever goad my guilty breast! alas! Alas! a virgin fair of rank and beauty From forth the holy convent's sacred walls I did seduce with sacrilegious arts; And in the black attempt I kill'd her brother. Wou'd Heav'n had snatch'd my memory away, And silenc'd soon the sharp accuser here!— For these repented crimes I'm thus condemn'd To drag about a living death within This horrid cave!—Five summers, Sir, are past Since these defrauded eyes have seen the sun, May the first light they view be that of Heav'n! Excuse my weakness, worthy gentlemen, My guilt is heavier than my galling load! FAULKNER. Your fault was fashion's crime;—I pity you: Can nothing, Sir, be thought of for your service? Have you no friend at court? no int'rest there? SLAVE. Alas! my int'rest in this world is vain, And all redress to me wou'd come too late! EVERARD. By Heav'n a happy thought! thou shalt be free! The manly, brave, the noble Count Alberti Is my distinguish'd, ever honour'd friend! Himself a soldier of the first emprize, The Emperor will never him refuse A boon like this; then hope, Sir, to be free. (Enter the OFFICER.) Get hence thou ugly fiend in human form! This happy soul shall soon defy thy power, Thy iron reign o'er him will quickly end! Few days shall pass 'fore he's from hence releas'd! OFFICER. Releas'd! there is but one release from hence, And death must be the bail! and ev'n then The body here must rest; this cave his tomb! You'll, Sir, remember me before you part. EVERARD. How vile extortion does itself sustain In this midway to Tartarus—from thence It came—and spread its baleful influence In the world above—how this caitiff vile This gaoler of a dungeon dark as hell Holds forth his pitchy palm for venal bribes, And impudently apes, forsooth, his betters. Thou man afflicted! I prophetick feel An impulse in my heart arise, that tells Thou shalt e'er long be blest with sacred freedom; Then hope—the Count Alberti is thy friend. SLAVE. I fain wou'd purchase yet another lease Of life, and be at large to pay my thanks— But hark! our nightly pious exercise Begins—to hear't may not displeasing prove. Follow, I'll guide where best you may behold! THE SOLEMN HYMN. By the Slaves. I. From scenes of horror, scenes of woe! No respite shall we ever know; Nor rising, nor a setting sun; At either still our pain's begun! We're doom'd thro' life in these drear cells To toil and hear each other's knells! II. Oh, God of mercy, God of pow'r, At mankind's first or latest hour, All are the objects of thy care! Fly hence black demons of despair! III. No den so deep—or dark a place But feels the radiance of thy grace; When least we hope the day may dawn, We from these terrors shall be drawn. CHORUS. Oh, God of mercy, God of pow'r, At mankind's first or latest hour, All are the objects of thy care! Fly hence black demons of despair! END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. CONSTANTIA'S House. LORENZO and LAURA. LORENZO. How did my sister go? and when depart? And which way did she steer her desp'rate course? Did you not strive to keep her till my coming? LAURA. My Lord, I did; as far as I cou'd dare, And ev'ry anxious argument employ'd, Which she with seeming acquiescence heard, And said she wou'd rely on Heav'n's decree; Then sent me forth to pray Rodolpho's lady Wou'd come to soothe her melancholy hours. I chearfully obey'd—but on return, Found, with astonishment, that she was gone! No token left behind of her design: 'Twas this fell paper hurried her away. LORENZO reads it. Cruel indeed, and of alarming purport; What subject's safe, if such dire orders pass Unfelt, and unresented by a people? Enter a SERVANT. SERVANT. The Prince Colredo— LORENZO. Are the dead reviv'd! Admit him straight—[Enter Colredo.] You are a sight of joy To me, tho' here a cause of misery— The ancient palace of Alberti's race Is now a desart scene of desolation; Its master to the Cave of Idra sent, And poor Constantia fled; we know not whither This cruel scroll has caus'd her sudden flight. COLREDO. Let me behold, and the contents peruse. [Reads it. “Leopold,”—that's not the Emperor's hand— LORENZO. No?— COLREDO. No, by Heav'n! I know it, Sir, as well As my own hand, and cannot be mistaken. LORENZO. But that is Seyfert's signature you'll own. COLREDO. It is most sure—and hence do I suspect Seyfert to be a most flagitious villain; Therefore I'm hither come for information Of all relating to th'unhappy duel, Ere I present me to the Emperor, Whom Seyfert has induc'd to think I'm dead; And had his plan succeeded must have been, Having employ'd a surgeon, not to cure But poison me—yet under friendship's mask. The man, too honest for so base a deed, Deceiving Seyfert, let me know the whole. This dark transaction soon shall be display'd In the strong colouring it deserves; and Prove the means of rescuing Alberti. Let's send forth scouts to scour the country round, And bring the fair Constantia to her home. You'll with me to the court, to join complaints Against this unprovok'd, this harden'd villain. LORENZO. My Lord, let's lose no time in virtue's cause. We'll call upon Rodolpho in our way, Whose interest will strengthen our design. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Cave. Enter EVERARD and FAULKNER followed by Slaves. EVERARD. It answers well what fame so loud reports, And is indeed prodigious!—so useful Are mechanic laws in all the offices Of artful life. FAULKNER. It is indeed amazing! And speaks the forward folly of the human heart. EVERARD. How luxury with lynx's eye can pierce Thro' Nature's bowels with a vulture-appetite And ransack to the centre for a toy! A shining toy, to dazzle vanity And glitter on the greedy eye of fashion, The shame of reason, and her boasted sons. SLAVE. Man has many natures in his essence, That long lie hid and unperceiv'd by him, But oft start up at rigour's strong command, Put on strange shapes, and leap the common bounds. Alas! we know not what distress can do. EVERARD. I long to see the sun for thy sad sake, And make thee in thy own despite yet happy. Oh! what an extasy to hearts humane, To lift th'oppress'd with comfort giving hand, And labour joyful for another's peace. SLAVE. Heaven will sure reward thy feeling heart, When I am mingled with the dust for ever. EVERARD. Nay, bend not thus to black despondence, Sir, Fortune and Count Alberti may bring back The blissful moments to thy wounded soul With unexpected speed—look up—be happy. SLAVE. The cordial of thy words, if aught on earth Cou'd lift my sorr'wing soul, wou'd make me happy. Enter ALBERTI behind with a Lamp, and on seeing EVERARD seems much surprized. EVERARD. The Count Alberti I have seen with joy Applauded, and with laurels cover'd o'er; He was indeed a man belov'd, and fortune Bless'd him; if he lives, he is happy still, And shines in favour at th'imperial court. ALBERTI. Ha! hark! do now my ears admonish truly, Or are those eager eyes inform'd aright? Oh, Heav'n and earth! it is, it is my friend! EVERARD. What means this prying slave? he seems to know me. ALBERTI. Is that the voice of friendship so long lost To my sad organs in this cave accurs'd! In spite of black despair it is my friend! I must be satisfied and look him through. EVERARD. What wou'd thy sharp inspection thus discover? ALBERTI. Is that! is that!—It is my honour'd Everard! EVERARD. Ha, thy Everard! Say what sprite art thou? Yet something grates upon my memory: I think I've heard that alter'd voice before. ALBERTI. Thou hast, indeed! in better time and place. My name! my name, alas! was once Alberti. EVERARD. Was once Alberti! ha! then know'st thou not The noble Count, my friend, who bears that name, That honour'd name? he cou'd surely serve thee. ALBERTI. I knew him once; but, oh! he's strangely alter'd. EVERARD. Not alter'd from his noble nature, sure, Or happy rank; thou dost betray his worth. ALBERTI. Aye, alter'd to the wretch that stands before thee— EVERARD. Ha! transform'd to such a thing as thou art! In such a shape as thine! the Count Alberti! ALBERTI. I cannot wonder at thy hard belief: Thou coud'st not sure expect to find me here. EVERARD. What, in the Cave of Idra! Nature now Has mingled mad extremes in one dark mass, And all distinction is for ever lost! Alberti foremost in the lists of glory! What minister of wrath has brought thee hither? ALBERTI. I have a tale to tell thee, Everard, that Wou'd melt the rocks of Scythia at the sound, Nay, make the tyrants of this dungeon weep. EVERARD. Thy state already racks my tortur'd soul. Can aught be added to a lot like thine? What dreadful tale of woe remains behind? ALBERTI. A tale unequal'd yet, by talking time, In all his registers of love and honour. EVERARD. Too true I see; by Heav'n it is thyself! The poor remains, the image pale, the manes Of my noble friend! Oh, tell! tell me all, Good Heav'n and earth, what brought thee to this den? ALBERTI. An evil chance administer'd my ruin. My crime was but a soldier's rash career, Who gave to glory what was wisdom's due. The Prince Colredo, Gen'ral of the horse, In rivalship of love and fame I fought, And left for dead upon th'appointed spot: Against th'Emperor's severe command, who Had forbid, on pain of death, the duel— For this sole act, to which my honour urg'd, Here am I doom'd to drag a painful life. Depriv'd of comfort, and of light for ever. SLAVE. Oh, how wond'rous are the ways of Heaven! My lot, my bitter lot resembles thine: I had a claim, like thee, to better fate. ALBERTI. Like me! like me! thou art but half a wretch— EVERARD. My hopes are blasted now of thy delivery: And oh, Alberti! injur'd man, my heart Must ever bleed for thee. SLAVE. Alas! my soul, Sir, wedded unto grief, With joy attended to thy chearing promise, But so repress'd by checks of rising fear As wont with minds in melancholy plung'd.— I dar'd not let keen rays of hope break forth, Howe'er illusive to my fancy's eye: They're now absorpt in disappointment's gloom.— Yet since the fam'd Alberti's here, why shou'd I With impious plaints just Providence arraign? [Looking affectionately at him. His hapless fate makes me forget my own. [Exit. ALBERTI. My gen'rous friend, enough! The door of hope, with adamantine bolt, Is barr'd against my banish'd breast for ever! This den my bed, these horrid walls my curtains, These bounds my prospect, and these sights my joy; This mortal atmosphere my vital gale; These fumes my frankincense, this vault my heav'n, Deep groans my music, and these lamps my noon; Hard stripes my triumph, and this yoke my vict'ry, My sceptre sorrow, and my crown despair! EVERARD. My greatly injur'd! Oh, my wretched friend! ALBERTI. Yet here, ev'n here, hath nature left her gates, Her thousand friendly gates wide open still, For wretchedness to pass, and lead to death: What! think'st thou, my Everard, that my soul Cou'd brook existence on such terms as these, This love of abject, hated, horrid life? To bear these bitter marks of nameless woe, And be a witness of my own undoing; To cling, to cleave a reptile in the dust, And own myself a man; a soldier too; Who fought for glory in the fields of fame, And gather'd laurels from the lance of death: Ha! this hand much better knows its office; A friendly dagger here shou'd write my prompt Discharge, and quickly free me from this cave. EVERARD. I shou'd not wonder at thy bold resolve, Nor blame the manly, hardy deed when done: Sure, none but hypocrites, and earth-born worms, Thy firm thy Roman purpose cou'd arraign, And call the necessary noble deed a crime. ALBERTI. And I had done it long e'er now, my friend, This vital pulse had ceas'd to beat, these eyes To see their own sad state; these ears to hear; This wretched, throbbing, breaking heart to suffer: And I had been beyond the reach of woe, And bid at once my horrid lot defiance.— But, Oh, my Everard! I am chain'd to being A precious magnet stronger than the earth, Th'attractive earth, and cent'ral sun, now draws Me to itself, and makes a heav'n of this Detested cave, and me an emperor. EVERARD. Alas, my noble friend! thy sorrows have Disturb'd thy better part: thou talkest idly; How my heart bleeds to see thy mind in ruins! ALBERTI. No, no, my Everard, all my thoughts are in Their proper places, and attend to reason, And every intellectual pulse beats right, Now, canst thou guess what reconciles my soul To this sad state, and brightens Idra's cave? Enter CONSTANTIA. CONSTANTIA. I have not miss'd thee from my side so long, Since that important day I first came hither: Oh, say then, what cou'd thus long detain thee? Or am I grown less pleasing to thy sight? ALBERTI. Oh, see the gem, th'inestimable gem! Whose bright angelic beam annihilates This nether hell, and makes it all a heav'n! Oh! unexampled, and immortal woman! Thou sole delight, thou phœnix of thy sex! Thou matchless wonder, and thou star of truth! Where now are all the boasts of ancient story? Or where is Cato's boasted daughter now? Look there upon that clouded angel's face, Oh, my Everard, and thy heart must bleed. EVERARD. I stand amaz'd, and know not what I do, For heaven's sake explain thyself my friend, And from this wonder draw the veil aside. ALBERTI. Throw down that mark of thy abhorr'd condition, And look upon that human face with joy. CONSTANTIA. What saving angel in the shape of man, Hath paid a visit to a wretch like thee! If heav'n hath sent thee, say thou art his friend, And brighten with thy smiles this dark abode. ALBERTI. He is my friend, and feels my heart's distress; Oh, Everard! turn thy eyes upon her, Eclipsed as she is; yet shining through The envious gloom that clouds her—Abstract, My friend, her sad exterior seeming, With eye intuitive, and read her soul. Her beauty once was worthy kings to bless, And spotless angels might compare with her. EVERARD. By heav'n, there's something in her air and port That awes me, thro' the mean disguise she wears; Nay more, I think I've seen this face ere now, When no afflictive darkness robb'd the world Of its resplendent lustre: tell me dethroned Beauty where thou once did'st reign—for my soul Wou'd be acquainted with thy sorrows, and List'ning, heaven knows, wou'd fain redress 'em. CONSTANTIA. I think I saw thee at my father's palace Attending on the Lord Ambassador, That very day the peace was solemniz'd, And all Vienna was in joy triumphant; I think I saw thee with my dear Alberti On friendly parties—and thy name is—Everard— EVERARD. By heaven, my faint conjecture aim'd aright, The only daughter of the Prince Vanesky— A curse upon your country's hated laws; What crime hast thou committed honour'd lady— Thou lovely innocence, condemn'd to groan With toiling slaves, and labour in a mine. ALBERTI. Her crime, my friend, is virtue in excess, Beyond example, and without a name: A voluntary victim she came hither; She left her father, and her faithful friends, She left the splendors which her lofty birth And plenteous fortune gayly flung around her, With a liberal and unsparing hand; She left the setting sun, the rising stars, She left the bloom of nature in its pride, She left the circling seasons, laughing year— She left the morning, and she follow'd me To darkness, danger, and the door of death, And thought herself a gainer by the change. CONSTANTIA. And shall for ever think: this tool, this mattock, This mark of mis'ry made for peasants hands, For groaning slaves to grasp, beneath the scourge Of task-imposing flinty fiends, in forms Of men: this emblem of calamity, This instrument of most severe affliction, This badge of sorrow sharp, I wou'd not change For the bright sceptre of the Gallic monarch; Nor quit this dungeon, to be Empress made Of all the earth, and rule the subject world, Without my dear Alberti.—Thou, thou art All to me; my father, friends, my fortune, Splendor, and the world's applause: thou to me Art all the seasons, sun, and moon, and stars, The smiles of nature, and the laughing year. ALBERTI. Hear'st thou that, my Everard!— EVERARD. Let my looks (my words are lost in wonder) Answer thee. And art thou of mortal mould, Can human nature boast a work like thee? The finish'd labour of thy Maker's hand; And wou'dst thou here consume thy precious life Within the horrors of this cave accurs'd? CONSTANTIA. Ah, look upon me, worthy Sir! behold, The marks of a resolv'd determin'd soul Are deep engraven here. Alas, they were Not made to witness in a cause like this; But they are honest. When I forsake thee, O thou dear matchless man! Bear witness heaven How I rejoice, how glory in my lot, And drag my chain with joy, link'd close to thine! With joy forget the gaudy glitt'ring world, When yok'd in bondage, and a slave with thee. ALBERTI. Now, now, it strikes upon my vital spring, My soul awakes, and rouses ev'ry pow'r; Oh, horrid thought! without all hope, all comfort, Thou shalt not thus be lost, for ever lost On my account; I here will dig my grave, And lay me down to sleep at rest for ever, Nor rob the world of such a saint as thee. Whilst thou my pride, my heart's ador'd delight, Shalt once more visit day, and see the sun, And bless thy parents and thy happy friends, And bless the joyful world.—By heaven, my Everard, 'Tis sacrilege, 'tis murder to detain her here— I'd rather die ten thousand deaths than she Shou'd be a slave; I cannot view that garb Without distraction!—dreadful words! Oh, never! CONSTANTIA. What means this conflict in thy troubled heart? This hasty, sudden, strange emotion in thee? ALBERTI. She must not perish in a sty like this, Who shou'd converse aloft with angels.—Go, Go back, and bless mankind with all thy virtues, All thy beauty, all thy bright example; Go back, be bless'd, and there forget there liv'd, There ever liv'd a wretch they call'd Alberti! CONSTANTIA. Curse on the counsel vile!—thou thankless, mean, Cruel, and unworthy man!—Is this then The grateful, kind, and dear return, for friends. For fame, for love, for dignity and rank, And all I've lost, triumphant lost for thee? Dig deep that grave thou talk'st of now, unkind, Make room enough for both, for both I say; O dig it to the centre down—deep, deep. Far from parents, light, life, the hated world, And ev'ry thought but thee, my heart's best joy. ALBERTI. Why blame my tenderness with such returns? Thou know'st my life is treasur'd up in thine. CONSTANTIA. Thou wou'dst not banish me to pomp and courts, To parents, friends, to comfort, light, and life; Thou wou'dst not envy me this bless'd abode, Nor rob me of the precious Cave of Idra! Let me dig up that grave, if thy poor hands Shou'd fail, and softly make that low laid bed Where undisturb'd we must for ever sleep. Alberti, was it kind to talk so strange, Thou treasure of my soul! thy cruel words Have ta'en away the props of sinking life— I never felt my bitter lot till now! Now these sad lamps seem dancing to my sight, And all their fading glimmer now goes out; Oh, my Alberti, I shall die before thee! [Faints. ALBERTI. She faints, she sinks, support her, O my Everard,— Wou'd nature now let down the springs of life In her and me, and in one happy moment Cut quick the vital threads of both asunder! O where is now that dagger which I hid, And shou'd release from pain—O stay my seraph! One gale of vital air may call her back: Come, help to bear her from this loathed cell— Assist, my Everard, thou art ever good.— END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Council Chamber in the Imperial Palace. RODOLPHO and LORENZO. LORENZO, The Prince Colredo, of right worthy fame, Has prov'd himself no recreant from his blood, And so press'd Seyfert as t'obtain a charge Against his conduct for perfidious crimes, Strengthen'd by some discoveries lately made, Which have his master's virtues so alarm'd, That in the summon'd council here to meet, He means in person to attend the trial. RODOLPHO. Then must that meteor fall, that baleful glar'd O'r all the land—whelming destruction sure On those who dar'd t'oppose his selfish views, And not consent to be the tools of vice. LORENZO. The crest fall'n traitor sees too late his error, That he must sink as sudden as he rose, Spurn'd by his Prince—detested by his peers, And object of the people's universal curse. RODOLPHO. But, behold his judges come! Enter Members of the Council.—COLREDO, and the other Courtiers as Auditors; the Emperor preceded by some of his Body Guards, before whom when seated, SEYFERT is brought in. COLREDO. Most august sov'reign of the German empire, Tho' nought to me more grating than t'impeach, Unless when grossest crimes compel me to it; Which mar allegiance—and disgrace the throne; Of all the charges, I 'gainst Seyfert urge, The first is to have made his creatures spread False rumours, as from me, to soil the fame Of fair Constantia—That the duel caus'd, 'Gainst which he publish'd his forbidding edict. The next, his having your imperial ear Abus'd with false reports, that brave Alberti Said, as my lot was in the field to fall, “Beneath his luckier sword, had the Emperor “Been there, he with repeated hostile wounds “Wou'd have reveng'd his tyrant prohibition. The third, his base intent upon my life, In having me convey'd, for secret cure, To a man brib'd by him to poison me, And so prevent my vindicating truth, In justly telling what Alberti said: “Colredo, I am sorry for thy fall— “Serve well our Prince; a better never reign'd! Behold a charge still worse—this wicked paper Sent to Constantia's house—the imperial name, A forgery as must to all appear. [The Members of the Council each view it.—The Emperor appears much agitated; one of the Council makes a sign for Colredo to go on.] His farther hellish scheme on the succeeding Night, was to have the widow'd mourner seiz'd, And carried to a place for violence form'd, To force dishonour on a hapless dame; And then her body in the Danube thrown As seeming by herself, through wild despair.— From which attempt, her lucky flight had sav'd her. The surgeon and the bravoes are without, Ready t'attest each article I've urg'd. The royal signing vouches its own falshood, Say, hast thou aught in answer to me, Seyfert? SEYFERT. No, my death's fix'd I see!—and do expect it. Revenge I wish'd for, and therein have fail'd; In my own toils I'm caught, and will not plead. THE EMPEROR. Thou monster in our kind! thou blot of nature! On whom ev'n hell must with amazement gaze, To think one man can all its wickedness Exceed—Hear then, thou villain multiplied! Forthwith Alberti shall be brought to court, With every honour that our state can pay To him and his much suffering Constantia. But on the morn of their arrival here, Thou diest!—and till the executing hour, Let that dire thought corrode thy ulcer'd soul— Begone thou wretch!—Guards, snatch him from my sight. [Seyfert is carried off. Haste thee, Lorenzo, let no time be lost, From Idra's Cave to bring the martyrs back, With whom shall worthy seem of royal mercy. If yet alive—their death's I greatly fear; And that Alberti, through heroic pride, Cou'd not survive the infamy of Idra. Shou'd it prove so? endless reproach to me! From that too common error of crown'd heads, A weak reliance on the faith of others, Instead of knowing all things by themselves— Break we up council—and all hence depart. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Cave. ALBERTI, EVERARD and FAULKNER. ALBERTI. What, live to see such mortal pangs again! Survive such conflicts and be still a man! Thou woud'st not have me live. EVERARD. For her dear sake, I'd bear it to the last, Lay down the weary load of life with her. ALBERTI. Thy reason is above such mean advice; Thy manly sentiments cry shame upon't; Didst not advise me to the brave resolve, And say that none but hypocrites cou'd blame it? Low, earth-born worms, and such as wanted souls To do it? thou did'st—and I'll thy council take. EVERARD. I knew not then the gripe that kept thee here, The vital anchor that forbid thy passage, And held thee fasten'd in the port of life; I knew not then—by Heav'n, thy woes distract me. ALBERTI. My date of sorrows shall be shorten'd soon, I'll burst the bonds, and set my love at large. EVERARD. For her dear sake endure this misery A little longer—unlook'd for remedies May sudden come from Heav'n's rich blissful store To thy relief, and all may yet be well. ALBERTI. I pray have done; I am resolv'd to die: Now look into thy own kind heart a little, Feel but one moment what thy friend must suffer; Oh, make my agonizing lot thy own, And figure to thyself what I must feel. Each moment is much worse to me than death: I die a thousand living deaths each hour; Thro' ev'ry sense the mortal arrows pierce, And dread reflection sharpens every point. EVERARD. Say, wou'dst thou murder her, by stabbing thus Thyself? She never will survive the blow; Consider that, and wait the will of Heav'n. ALBERTI. Cou'd I bear all the bitter task for both; Cou'd I from her pluck all the thorny anguish, And plant it deep in this devoted bosom; Cou'd I with tenfold tortures her redeem, And set her sad imprison'd soul at large; By Heav'n, I'd groan with joy beneath the load, The precious load that made her burden light, And step by step keep equal pace with time, Till she and nature shou'd together sink To fate's abyss, and with the world expire! EVERARD. And she deserves it from thy grateful heart, The pride of nature and the boast of time; But, oh! consider thou wilt murder her. ALBERTI. She shall not see me give the gen'rous blow; And lenient time may heal the wound in her, But whilst I live her bondage must remain; Her miseries are grafted on my being; She will be wretched whilst she looks on me, And all her woes are plac'd to my account. I must remove the magnet from her sight, And then my precious angel will be free, And live long years of joy when I am gone, And mix'd with this forgotten mould for ever: It shall be so—by Heav'n, my friend, it shall! See my remains deposited in dust, With all the decency this den affords. Then take her with thee to the earth's green lap, These horrid limits cannot hold her here, For she's as free as fragrant gales that breathe O'er laughing lawns, and beds of roses sweet. O take her with thee, like the morning star, And let her see her father and her friend; And, oh! if possible, let Constantia Never think more of lost Alberti's name! Oh, must I then be torn from her for ever! Oh, must I never more behold her face! Oh, agony! beyond enduring long; Distraction quick; or instant death shall save me! Now, my Everard, all my doubts shall vanish; And with this blow I conquer my hard fate! Enter CONSTANTIA. CONSTANTIA. Ah, stop thy horrid hand! what wou'd thy phrenzy! Ruffian, coward, traitor to thy love and me! ALBERTI. Stand off, thou idol of my parting soul! I die the martyr of my love and thee; I cannot look upon thy face and live: Nor love, nor friendship shall bind down this hand: No pow'r on earth, not ev'n thy much lov'd arm! CONSTANTIA. Oh, help me, Everard! to restrain his rage. Was this thy mean invented trick to steal, And leave me struggling in the breach alone? What, like a bravo, play the coward's part, The poorest meanest coward's part; fling down That daring instrument of fear and shame; And let a woman teach thee to be brave. ALBERTI. Live Constance, I command thee live—be happy, And listen to my Everard; he will be A friend to thee, thou idol of my soul— Nay—all thy fond entreaties are in vain; Thy precious tears that mingle with my blood, That look that might disarm a tyger's rage, My resolution is too strong for all. My Everard will be thy faithful friend, And to thy happy father safe restore thee; This moment is the last I e'er shall breathe— Remember well the dear advice I give thee; A long farewell to all— Enter a Slave with Lights, followed by LORENZO and Officer. LORENZO. Hold thy rash hand! ALBERTI. Ha! is there then a ruling hand above! Or are they mortals that prevent my fate? Oh! art thou then a messenger of grace Sent down with winged speed from watchful Heav'n? Ah, is there then one friendly angel there, Who thinks upon a wretch like lost Alberti? LORENZO. There is, there is, recover thy lost reason: I come to chear thee now with joyful tidings. ALBERTI. Eternal Providence, I now adore thee! My brother, and my friend, the Lord Lorenzo! LORENZO. Art thou the sad remains of him I lov'd, The gallant, noble, and the brave Alberti? ALBERTI. I am thy friend; thy wretched friend, thy brother. LORENZO. My happy brother, and my rescu'd friend, Say, is my wretched sister yet alive? Or has she perish'd in this horrid cave? ALBERTI. She lives, thy injur'd sister lives, with mind As radiant, as her form is darken'd—See The drooping angel by her woes oppress'd; My tranced soul! Oh, what a change is here! LORENZO. Oh, my dear, my long-lost and injur'd sister! Oh, pow'r of mercy, what a sight is here! Oh, speak Constantia, and rejoice with me. Look kindly on thy lov'd, thy dear Lorenzo, He brings thee news will drive thy woes away; Thy husband's pardon, and thy father's blessing. CONSTANTIA. To leave me shiv'ring in a place like this, Who came so far, so very far to see him! Had I a dagger I shou'd soon be with him. He stole unkindly from my widow'd arms, And I shall search about in vain to find him; Oh! this will be a bitter night to me! LORENZO. Thy groundless grief misleads thy troubled mind, It is but fancy and deceitful vision. CONSTANTIA. I saw the bloody dagger in his hand; To leave his Constance in the Cave of Idra! What storms, what whirlwinds thunder in that thought! Ay, there the dagger gleams—Ah! see—he sits On yonder cloud, and waits to take me with him!— LORENZO. Thy husband lives, and kneels with joy before thee. Enjoy my sister, this blest change of fortune; Call home thy reason, and behold thy husband With open arms and panting heart before thee. CONSTANTIA. That cursed dagger! had I snatch'd thee first, My husband, now, and I had slept together;— It was so selfish and so fraudful in him, I thought him honest as the laws of heav'n; I will pursue him to the courts on high— These doors are barr'd, and I'm a slave for ever. LORENZO. Call reason home, reflect my dearest sister, Thy husband lives, and I'm thy happy brother. CONSTANTIA. What dreadful glimpses shoot athwart my mind, And let in light on my distracted soul! Oh, barbarous Alberti!—Who stands there? Or does his cruel phantom mock me thus? Or am I with him in the world of spirits? ALBERTI. Alas, my love! I am no spirit, but Alberti— Thy god-like brother stop'd my desp'rate hand; He was the saving angel that preserv'd me: Thy brother, Lord Lorenzo, stands before thee, He brings my pardon, and thy father's blessing. CONSTANTIA. How my mind labours, and my senses wander! A train of motley'd things are marshal'd now Before me: who stands there?—Is that white hope That mingles with the throng—and drives far off The ugly forms of black despair?—I saw The bloody dagger in his bosom plung'd— And yet, methinks, I saw my brother too. LORENZO. Thou did'st; thy loving brother stands before thee. CONSTANTIA. The clouds clear up, the dawn approaches nigh, The curtain of my fate has chang'd its colour; I see a thousand gaudy visions there! It is the story of my chequer'd life! How the white brightens, and the black grows pale— The morning beams; 'tis day-light all around.— What shapes are these? My brother and my husband! It is my noble brother! and my husband Is yet alive! I see them both before me!— Now radiant joys come rushing to my bosom; Oh, now, divide my panting heart between you! My raptur'd soul comes leaping to my lips! My brother and my husband, both alive! And in the Cave of Idra! Oh, come both; Come both, my heart shall make you ample room, And lodge ye both within my breast for ever! There never was a wretch so blest as I? LORENZO. O thou art bless'd beyond the reach of hope, The reach of wishes, and the world's despite. ALBERTI. Yes, thou shalt shine once more my precious love, Among the courtly stars distinguish'd high, And crown'd the richest constellation there, With virtuous beauty brighter than the sun. CONSTANTIA. Thy love is all my highest boast on earth; My brother! what a happy change is this? My dearest brother, say how cam'st thou hither? LORENZO. I will explain it all in proper season, And thy much harass'd soul shall taste of comfort. ALBERTI. Ah, Constantia! thy hurted mind had near— Forgive my rashness, Oh! I cou'd not live And see thee wretched for my sake—forgive me. CONSTANTIA. I will not now rebuke thy rash attempt, Nor call thy cruel purpose by its name; I'll talk of nothing now but joy and wonder. My bounding heart! I know not what I do! So sudden, and so glorious! from this hell To that bright Heav'n! I cannot bear such bliss, It is too much for my oppressed spirit, Weak nature sinks beneath the vast extreme— Let doubting infidels be dumb for ever. Thou cave accurs'd, my soul shall bless thee now; Still call thy precious image up, both day And night, with bitter, sweet remembrance. I Shall see my father's face again—Embrace His aged rev'rend knees, and ask his blessing— Then shall my mother shed the tears of joy With melting heart upon her kneeling daughter; Then shall my husband say that I deserve him. ALBERTI. His pride, his boast, and his eternal triumph! O thou shalt be thy happy husband's theme Thro' ev'ry joyful stage of rescued life; And, Oh, when gentle time with lenient hand By weary nature taught, shall lay me down In hoary resignation sweet on thy Peaceful pillow, and in thy arms held fast, My fault'ring tongue in feeble dying sounds, With closing eyes in life's expiring gasp, Shall call on Constance and the Cave of Idra.— Oh, I will for ever love and bless thee— But ages of delight wide stretch between us And that distant hour; Oh! thou shalt ere then Be blest and honour'd by th'adoring world. Thy worth shall be the theme of ev'ry muse, And breathing statues shall record thy name. LORENZO. Haste hence my brother, O my sister, haste, These hateful weeds offend me to the soul. ALBERTI. Constantia come, let's take the last farewel Of our sad dwelling, reassume ourselves, And visit light with chearful hearts once more. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An Area before the Palace. FAULKNER and MENTZEL, MENTZEL. That human wickedness to such a pitch Can rise, present and future times must wonder! Vindictive Seyfert! Monster of the age! Is a disgrace to nature and our country. He has entail'd dishonour on his name; His house is cancel'd from nobility; And he, weak compensation for his guilt, This morn in private is to suffer death, That his fell breath mayn't taint the atmosphere, When the heroic suff'rers shall approach. FAULKNER. How just are thy awards, O Providence! To let the vicious run their course of pride, And in their full career to check, when least They dread the interposing hand of Heav'n! Enter Guards, SEYFERT, BURMAN, and Chaplain to the Prison. MENTZEL. But the door opens; and the guard comes forth To range around the scaffold—what despair And complicated terror in his look. FAULKNER. We now shall see how vice can meet its end. That done we'll haste without the city gate To view th'investiture, in all its pomp, Of Count Alberti for the golden fleece, And fair Constantia for Teresa's order; The highest tribute e'er was paid to virtue. MENTZEL. And just, since virtue is above all human titles. SEYFERT. Oh, faithful Burman, thou in me behold'st Of what uncertain tenure's human life, When not conducted by the rules of virtue! Instead of foll'wing policy's vile tracks, Whose wicked dictates teach men to be false, To spurn at feelings of our fellow creatures, As a mean weakness, quite beneath a statesman. Thus oft inhumanly I've dealt by others, For which I'm doom'd to punishment condign; Nor shall I startle from the sword, but wish Its friendly blow, to put an end to pain, Rather than live the scorn, the hate of all, And daily undergo new infamy. Though in this world—no mercy I desire, 'Tis th'utmost stretch of daring expectation For crimes like mine to hope it in the next. CHAPLAIN. Forbear rash man, nor dare to circumscribe Th'almighty will— SEYFERT. I am prepar'd [To Burman.]—proceed— Accept this ring in token of thy truth, And see thy master in his coffin laid. [Exeunt Burman, Seyfert, &amp;c. SCENE II. One of the Court-Yards of the Imperial Palace. RODOLPHO and EVERARD. RODOLPHO. How stupenduous are the ways of Heaven! Was ever change so happy, so deserv'd And glorious!—Believe me, Sir, my heart Exults!—Amazement mix'd with joy elates My raptur'd soul! my much lov'd rescu'd friend! I feel his transports, and I share his honours. EVERARD. This wond'rous revolution has impress'd Upon my mind a sense of Providence More strong than ever, and my thoughts are heighten'd To a more elevated pitch—I feel A glow of fervour in my conscious mind, From bright revealing truth! amazing all! But heav'nly power extends its gracious arm Beyond the narrow reach of mortal sight, And often is as wonderful as good!— The virtuous, the distress'd, shou'd ne'er despair, And fair Constantia is a glorious proof. RODOLPHO. The noblest in the regist'ry of years, Her love and virtue are without a rival In Hebrew annals, or in Grecian tales, Nor can the Roman records boast her equal. EVERARD. How much it to your monarch's praise redounds, A glorious lesson to all patriot kings, Thus to concession make for injur'd worth, And retribution for the wrongs it suffer'd. RODOLPHO. The mandate's given, that they procession make Thro' the great street that to the palace leads, With ev'ry honour that's to sov'reigns paid; And make the city's rampart shake around. EVERARD. But here comes Clermont, the brave Gallic youth, Noble Alberti rescu'd from the cave.— That happiness I long foretold you, Sir, Is come to pass—I now congratulate Your safe return to light and liberty! Enter CLERMONT. CLERMONT. O most humane and gen'rous Sir, words are Too weak t'express my grateful, fervent thanks For your kind aid—and friendly influence— Bless'd be the name of Britain—whose fam'd sons Thus feel for mis'ry, and abhor oppression! EVERARD. Sure, from the joy strong painted on thy face, The exiles are receiv'd with loud acclaims. CLERMONT. My gladden'd eyes with friendly tears o'erflow'd, On seeing of such universal joy. Each house with richest tapestry is hung, And ev'ry window throng'd with crowding looks, In joyful expectation of their coming.— While jostling multitudes through streets below, Ask of each other, have they yet appear'd? How looks Constantia?—Is Alberti chang'd? But none have time to give a gentle answer, So eager rush all forward to behold them. RODOLPHO, This narrative's a cordial to my soul. CLERMONT. The old, the young, congratulate each other With thousand blessings on th'Emperor's name, For having punish'd such a fiend as Seyfert, And nobly rescu'd such heroic virtue! In short, on ev'ry side, from ev'ry tongue, Constantia and Alberti are the theme!— [A gun. Hark! that's the signal of their march begun, Let's haste to view, and join them as they come. SCENE III. The Great Street of Vienna. A grand Procession; Flowers are strew'd by the People.—Shouts frequently heard, with ringing of Bells and firing of Cannon. —An Ode of rejoicing—which follows here. I. They come, they come, the honour'd pair, He the valiant, she the fair; Of green branches strip the bow'rs, Strew their path with fragrant flow'rs. Be this the song on all our plains, Vice is punish'd, virtue reigns. II. Let wrinkled age now smooth its brow, And blooming youth this truth avow; No objects more our wonder move Than those who've suffer'd most for love. Be this the song on all our plains, Vice is punish'd, virtue reigns. III. Celestial beings with delight On earth must view so rare a sight; What god-like attributes belong T'a monarch's owning he was wrong, And due redress to the injur'd deigns; Vice is punish'd, virtue reigns. CHORUS. They come, they come, &amp;c. At the Close of the Procession, enter ALBERTI and CONSTANTIA. ALBERTI. Am I once more within Vienna's walls, The fav'rite scene of all my youthful years? And what is more, my dear Constantia here? CONSTANTIA. Oh, my Alberti, my fond heart is full! I can't find words—to speak my raptur'd soul! T'encrease our joy—your faithful friends appear. Enter EVERARD and FAULKNER. Alberti. Now, good Everard, let my arms embrace thee As suits thy station—and the Count Alberti. Say, worthy friend! did ever mortal meet So happy a reverse—from so deplor'd a state? EVERARD. Never, indeed! nor ever so deserv'd— ALBERTI. Behold that angel to herself restor'd: Was she an inmate for the Cave of Idra? Let Europe gaze—let kings fall down before her. Now, gen'rous Everard, recognize that face! Revere that form where every virtue dwells: Let Oral tales—and history be dumb!— Let blushing time destroy his annals now, And sum up all his boasted list in her.— EVERARD. The kindling ardour of thy raptur'd soul Has fir'd my breast—I see her all perfection; I see her reap the harvest of her glory. A thousand triumphs welcome thee to light, [To Constantia. Thou matchless wonder, and thou beauteous saint! Earth's flow'ry honours strew thy virtuous path, And shouting thousands welcome thee to life! To friends, to parents, with thy lov'd Alberti! CONSTANTIA. To all my heart shall ever glow with thanks.— 'Tis more than recompence for all my wrongs.— Who, Sir, wou'd grudge to suffer as we've done, If sure of meeting with such publick praise? Thy friendship in my breast, engraven deep, Kind, worthy Everard, shall ever live! ALBERTI. Hast thou yet seen the generous Rodolpho, Whose worth shall to my soul be always dear. EVERARD. I have, and am but parted from him now; He to the court is gone, to learn what lords Are to conduct you to th'imperial presence. ALBERTI. Oh! inexpressive joy! behold, he's here! With him Lorenzo and Colredo come! RODOLPHO. Oh! my Alberti! ALBERTI. Rodolpho! best of men. LORENZO. Lo, brother, to compleat our ev'ry joy, I, and Colredo, by the Emperor sent, Are now to bring and place you 'fore the throne. COLREDO. Illustrious Sir, and you most honour'd Lady, Permit me, e'er I dare like other friends, T'embrace, and warm congratulations join, To clear my name from Seyfert's foul reports. I ne'er spoke of you but with that respect, [To Constantia. Which borders more on a religious worship Than polish'd courtesy to human race. [To Alberti. So far from envying thy happy lot, This consolation for my loss I bore, That from the rival crowd of her admirers, Sh'had chos'n a man much worthier than myself. ALBERTI. A soul like yours cou'd ne'er seek such revenge, My heart absolves—and greets a former friend. CONSTANTIA. I always knew Colredo's princely honour, And ne'er cou'd think he'd stoop to acts of baseness. RODOLPHO. Shame endless to the name that spread the doubt. COLREDO. That a fell villain shou'd such mischief work! But he's no more! and my resentment dies! LORENZO. Let's think not of it—or th'infernal cause; Give signal to advance—Heralds lead on. The Song is renew'd without, till the Procession is quite off the Stage: Two Curassiers remain on, who had followed the Procession. 1st CURASSIER. How diff'rent this return from the late exit Which brave Alberti from Vienna made, And felon-like to Idra's Cave was sent. 2d CURASSIER. The then proud heart of Seyfert now lies low!— His deeds posterity will tell with horror! And pour eternal curses on his name. 1st CURASSIER. While the long pageant to the palace moves, Let's to the church, where with religious pomp For this event, thanksgiving's to be sung. 2d CURASSIER. A worthier cause than for a battle won. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Grand Saloon of Audience. The Emperor on his Throne in the Robes of Sov'reignty, attended by his Courtiers.—ALBERTI and CONSTANTIA kneeling. EMPEROR. Arise—Thus for your sufferings I bow.— All, all, salute them as your sov'reign's friends— In saving you—how is my glory sav'd! Had ye died victims of a sentence rash, What from my name cou'd e'er the stain eraze? That all the records of succeeding ages, Must shrink from with the utmost detestation! But th'interference of all-ruling Heaven Has snatch'd me from precipitate disgrace, Which ever must supremacy befal, That vests with ministerial pow'r a wretch, Who'd veil with virtuous mask, the worst designs To favour vengeful or ambitious views. [Rises from the throne. From such—Omnipotence protect my throne! Let me not, seated there, forget I'm man; To thee amenable for all my judgments: In that dread day when no distinction's known, To give man pow'r is but the means of sin, Unless with wisdom you that pow'r direct, And shield his breast from passion's anarchy.— Alberti, thy merit and thy sufferings Claim from me a due reward—Hence do I Here appoint thee to act for us with just, With delegated sway throughout the empire, And all acknowledge what I now declare him: Guide of my councils—General of the brave. —To Constantia.— While from thy sex thou shalt all honours have, Mirror of wives—and Heroine of the Cave!

Now, that Alberti's safe, within my calling, With him, 'fore liberty, I'd chuse enthralling; By day to work, by night to fondly cling: For a good husband is so good a thing! No mountain sure so high, no vale so steep, One wou'd not boldly soar, or lowly creep, In anxious quest of that dear charming creature, A man of honour, polish'd sense, good nature! O, Ladies, Ladies, what enchanting treasure! May ye be all possest of such—No measure To your encreasing bliss can e'er be known, As from experience zealously you'll own; If on your parts with virtuous emulation, You've always foremost in chaste contemplation; To clear the tarnish'd glory of our nation: That thro' the various ranks of human life, Woman's first title is a faithful wife. Therein is all her fortitude to shine, With truth heroic, sanctity divine; That angels with complacence joy to view, And was the moral sketch our authors drew. Tho' we've no ribband for such worth to give, In Fame's immortal regist'ry you'll live;— Exalted models of true female merit, And blooming maids will lineally inherit, That purest recompence to hearts refin'd The world's applause, and self approving mind. Thus far I've dar'd; to trespass more, I wave— Deem it not forward, I one favour crave— You'll sometimes think on, Th'Heroine of the Cave.</field>
