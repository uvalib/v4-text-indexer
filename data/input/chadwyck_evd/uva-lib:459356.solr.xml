      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDYE OF SOLYMAN AND PERSEDA. VVherein is laide open, Loues constancy, Fortunes inconstancy, and Deaths Triumphs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. Enter Loue, Fortune, Death. Loue. What, Death and Fortune crosse the way of Loue? For. Why, what is Loue, but Fortunes tenis-ball? Death. Nay, what are you both, but subiects vnto Death? And I commaund you to forbeare this place: For heere the mouth of sad Melpomene, Is wholy bent to tragedies discourse; And what are Tragedies but acts of death? Here meanes the wrathfull muse in seas of teares, And lowd laments to tell a dismall tale: A tale wherein she lately hath bestowed, The huskie humour of her bloudy quill, And now for tables takes her to her tung. Loue. Why thinkes Death, Loue knowes not the historie? Of braue Erastus and his Rodian dame: Twas I that made their harts consent to loue, And therefore come I now as fittest person, To serue for chorus to this Tragedie. Had not I beene, they had not dyed so soone. Death. Had I not beene, they had not dyed so soone. For. Nay then it seemes you both doo misse the marke, Did not I change long loue to sudden hate? And then rechange their hatred into loue: And then from loue deliuer them to death? Fortune is chorus. Loue and death be gone. Death. I tell thee Fortune, and thee wanton Loue, I will not downe to euerlasting night, Till I haue moralliz'd this Tragedy, Whose cheefest actor was my sable dart. Loue. Nor will I vp into the brightsome sphere, From whence I sprung, till in the chorus place, I make it knowne to you and to the world, What interest Loue hath in Tragedies. For. Nay then though Fortune haue delight in change, Ile stay my flight, and cease to turne my wheele, Till I haue showne by demonstration, What intrest I haue in a Tragedie. Tush, Fortune can doo more then Loue or Death. Loue. Why stay we then, lets giue the Actors leaue. And as occasion serues, make our returne. Exeunt. Enter Erastus and Perseda. Erast. Why when Perseda wilt thou not assure me? But shall I like a mastlesse ship at sea, Goe euery way and not the way I would: My loue hath lasted from mine infancie, And still increased as I grew my selfe, When did Perseda pastime in the streetes, But her Erastus ouer-eied her sporte: When didst thou with thy sampler in the Sunne, Sit sowing with thy feres, but I was by Marking thy lilly hands dexteritie: Comparing it to twenty gratious things. When didst thou sing a note that I could heare, But I haue framde a dittie to the tune, Figuring Perseda twenty kinde of waies. When didst thou goe to Church on hollidaies, But I haue waited on thee too and fro: Marking my times as Faulcons watch their flight. When I haue mist thee how haue I lamented, As if my thoughts had bene assured true. Thus in my youth, now since I grew a man, I haue perseuered to let thee know, The meaning of my true harts coustancie: Then be not nice Perseda as women woont, To hasty louers whose fancy soone is fled: My loue is of a long continuance, And merites not a strangers recompence. Per. Enough Erastus thy Perseda knowes, She whom thou wouldst haue thine, Erastus knowes, Erast. Nay my Perseda knowes, and then tis well. Per. I watch you vauntages, thine be it then, I haue forgot the rest, but thats the effect: Which to effect, accept this carkanet, My Grandame on her death bed gaue it me, And there, euen there I vow'd vnto my selfe, To keepe the same vntill my wandring eye, Should finde a harbour for my hart to dwell. Euen in thy brest doo I elect my rest, Let in my hart to keepe thine company. Erast. And sweet Perseda accept this ring, To equall it, receiue my hart to boot, It is no boot, for that was thine before? And far more welcome is this change to me, Then sunny daies to naked Sauages, Or newes of pardon to a wretch condemde, That waiteth for the fearefull stroke of death. As carefull will I be to keepe this chaine, As doth the mother keepe her children, From water pits, or falling in the fire. Ouer mine armour will I hang this chaine, And when long combat makes my body faint, The sight of this shall shew Persedas name, And ad fresh courage to my fainting limmes. This day the eger Turke of Tripolis, The Knight of Malta, honoured for his worth, And he thats titled by the golden spurre. The Moore vpon his hot barbarian horse, The fiery Spaniard bearing in his face, The empresse of a noble warriour. The sudden Frenchman, and the bigbound Dane, And English Arthers hardy men at armes, Eclipped Lyons of the westerne worlde: Eche one of these approued combatants, Assembled from seuerall corners of the world, Are hither come to try their force in armes, In honor of the Prince of Cipris nuptials. Amongst these worthies will Erastus troupe, Though like a Gnat amongst a hiue of Bees: Know me by this thy pretious carkanet, And if I thriue, in valour as the glasse That takes the Sun-beames burning with his force: Ile be the glasse, and thou that heauenly Sun, From whence Ile borrow what I do atchieue. And sweet Perseda vnnoted though I be, Thy beauty yet shall make me knowne ere night. Per. Yong slippes are neuer graft in windy daies, Yong schollers neuer entered with the rod, Ah my Erastus there are Europes Knights, That carry honour grauen in their helmes, And they must winne it deere that winne it thence. Let not my beauty prick thee to thy bane, Better sit still then rise and ouer-tane. Erast. Counsell me not, for my intent is sworne, And be my fortune as my loue deserues. Per. So be thy fortune as thy features serues. And then Erastus liues without compare. Enter a Messenger. Here comes a Messenger to haste me hence, I know your message, hath the Princesse sent for me? Messen. She hath, and desires you to consort her to the triumphes. Enter Piston. Piston. Who saw my Master? O sir, are you heeere? The Prince and all the outlandish Gentlemen, Are ready to goe to the triumphs, they stay for you. Erast. Goe sirra, bid my men bring my horse, and a dosen staues. Pist. You shall haue your horses and two dosen of staues. Exit Piston. Erast. Wish me good hap Perseda and Ile winne Such glory, as no time shall ere race out, Or end the period of my youth in blood. Per. Such fortune as the good Andromache, Wisht valiant Hector wounded with the Greekes, I wish Erastus in his maiden warres. Orecome with valour these high minded Knights, As with thy vertue thou hast conquered me, Heauens heare my harty praier and it effect. Exeunt. Enter Philippo, the Prince of Cipris, Basilisco, and all the Knights. Phil. Braue knights of Christendome, and turkish both, Assembled heere in thirsty honors cause, To be enrolled in the brasse leaued booke, Of neuer wasting perpetuitie. Put Lambe-like mildenes to your Lyons strength, And be our tilting like two brothers sportes, That exercise their war with friendly blowes. Braue Prince of Cipris, and our sonne in law, Welcome these worthies by their seuerall countries, For in thy honor hither are they come, To grace thy nuptials with their deeds at armes. Cipris. First welcome thrise renowned Englishman, Graced by thy country, but ten times more By thy approued valour in the field, Vpon the onset of the enemy, What is thy motto when thou spurres thy horse. Englishman. In Scotland was I made a Knight at armes, Where for my countries cause I chargde my Launce: In France I tooke the Standard from the King, And giue the flower of Gallia in my crest. Against the light foote Irish haue I serued, And in my skinne beare tokens of their skenes: Our word of courage all the world hath heard, Saint George for England, and saint George for me. Cipris. Like welcome vnto thee faire Knight of Fraunce, Well famed thou art for discipline in warre, Vpon the incounter of thine enemy, What is thy mot renowned Knight of Fraunce. French-man. In Italie I put my knighthoode on, Where in my shirt but with my single Rapier, I combated a Romane much renownd, His weapons point impoysoned for my bane, And yet my starres did bode my victory, Saint Denis is for France and that for me. Cipris. Welcome Castilian too amongst the rest, For fame doth sound thy valour with rhe rest: Vpon thy first incounter of thy foe, What is thy woord of courage braue man of Spaine? Spaniard. At fourteene yeeres of age was I made Knight, When twenty thousand Spaniards were in field, What time a daring Rutter made a challenge To change a bullet with our swift flight shot, And I with single heed and leuell hit, The haughty challenger and strooke him dead. The golden Fleece is that we cry vpon, And Iaques, Iaques, is the Spaniards choice. Cipris. Next, welcome vnto thee renowned Turke, Not for thy lay, but for thy worth in armes: Vpon the first braue of thine enemy, What is thy noted word of charge, braue Turke? Bruser. Against the Sophy in three pitched fields, Vnder the conduct of great Soliman, Haue I bene chiefe commaunder of an hoast, And put the flint heart Perseans to the sword. The desert plaines of Affricke haue I staind, With blood of Moores, and there in three set battels fought, Marcht conquerour through Asia, Along the coasts held by the Portinguze, Euen to the verge of golde, aboording Spaine Hath Brusor led a valiant troope of Turkes, And made some Christians kneele to Mahometz Him we adore, and in his name I crie, Mahomet for me and Solyman. Cip. Now Signeur Basilisco you we know, And therefore giue not you a strangers welcome, You are a Rutter borne in Germanie, Vpon the first encounter of your foe: What is your braue vpon the enemy? Basi. I fight not with my tongue, this is my Oratrix. Laying his hand vpon his sword. Cip. Why Signeur Basilisco is it a she sword? Basi. I, and so are all blades with me: beholde my instance Perdie, each female is the weaker vessell, And the vigour of this arme infringeth, The temper of any blade, quoth my assertion, And thereby gather, that this blade beeing arprooued weaker than this lim, may very wel bear a feminine Epitheton. Cip. Tis well proued, but whats the word that glories your Countrey? Basi. Sooth to say, the earth is my Countrey, As the aire to the fowle, or the marine moisture, To the red guild fish: I repute my selfe no coward: For humilitie shall mount. I keepe no table To character my fore-passed conflicts. As I remember, there happened a sore drought In some part of Belgia, that the iucie grasse, Was seared with the Sunne Gods Element. I held it pollicie, to put the men children Of that climate to the sword, That the mothers teares might releeue the pearched earth. The men died, the women wept, and the grasse grew, Els had my Frize-land horse perished, Whose losse would haue more grieued me, Than the ruine of that whole Countrey. Vpon a time in Ireland I fought, On horsebacke with an hundred Kernes, From Titans Easterne vprise, to his Westerne downe-fall: Insomuch that my Steed began to faint: I coniecturing the cause to be want of water, dismounted: In which place there was no such Element, Enraged therefore with this Semitor, All on foote like an Herculian ofspring, Endured some three or foure howers combat, In which processe, my body distilled such dewy showers of swet, That from the warlike wrinckles of my front, My Palfray coold his thirst. My mercy in conquest, is equall with my manhood in fight, The teare of an infant, hath bin the ransome of a conquered cittie, Whereby I purchased the surname of Pities adomant. Rough wordes blowe my choller, As the winde dooth Mulcibers worke house, I haue no word, because no countrey, Each place is my habitation, Therefore each countries word mine to pronounce. Princes, what would you? I haue seene much, heard more, but done most, To be briefe, hee that will try me, let him waft mee with his arme. I am his, for some fiue launces. Although it go against my starres to iest, Yet to gratulate this beninge Prince, I will suppresse my condition. Phylip. He is beholding to you greatly sir: Mount ye braue Lordings, forwards to the tilt, My selfe will censure of your chiualrie, And with impartiall eyes behold your deedes, Forward braue Ladies, place you to behold The faire demeanor of these warlike Knights. Exeunt. Manet Basilisco. Basi. I am melancholy: an humor of Venus belegereth me. I haue reiected with contemptable frownes, The sweet glances of many amorous girles, or rather ladies: But certes, I am now captiuated with the reflecting eye Of that admirable comet Perseda. I will place her to behold my triumphes, And do woonders in hir sight, O heauens, she comes, accompanied with a child, Whose chin beares no impression of manhood, Not an hayre, not an excrement. Enter Erastus, Perseda, and Pystan. Erast. My sweet Perseda. Exeunt Erastus and Perseda. Basi. Peace Infant thou blasphemest. Pist. You are deceiued sir, he swore not, Basi. I tell thee Iester he did worse, he cald that Ladie his, Pist. Iester: O extempore, o flores! Basi. O harsh vnedicate, illiterate pesant, Thou abusest the phrase of the Latine. Pist. By gods fish friend, take you the Latins part, ile abuse you to. Basi. What saunce dread of our indignation? Pist. Saunce: what languidge is that? I thinke thou art a worde maker by thine occupation. Basi. I, tearmest thou me of an occupation, Nay then this fierie humor of choller is supprest, By the thought of loue. Faire Ladie, Pist. Now by my troth she is gon. Basi. I, hath the Infant transported her hence, He saw my anger figured in my brow, And at his best aduantage stole away, But I will follow for reuenge. Pist. Naye, but here you sir, I must talke with you before you goe. Then Piston gets on his back, and puls him downe. Basi. O if thou beest magnanimious, come before me. Pist. Naye, if thou beest a right warrior, get fr? vnder me. Bas. What wouldst thou haue me a Typhon, To beare vp Peleon or Ossa? Pist. Typhon me no Typhons, But sweare vpon my Dudgin dagger, Not to go till I giue thee leaue, But stay with me, and looke vpon the tilters. Bas. O thou seekst thereby to dim my glory. Pist. I care not for that, wilt thou not sweare? Bas. O I sweare, I sweare. He sweareth him on his Dagger. Pist. By the contents of this blade, Bas. By the contents of this blade, Pist. I the aforesaid Basilisco, Bas. I the aforesaid Basilisco, Knight good fellow, knight, knight. Pist. Knaue good fellow, knaue, knaue. Will not offer to go from the side of Piston. Bas. Will not offer to go from the side of Pyston, Pist. Without the leaue of the said Piston obtained, Bas. Without the leaue of the said Piston, Licensed, obtayned and granted. Pist. Inioy thy life and liue, I giue it thee. Bas. I inioy my life at thy hands, I confesse it, I am vp, but that I am religious in mine oath, Pist. What would you do sir, what would you do, Will you vp the ladder sir, and see the tilting. Then they go vp the ladders, and they sound within to the first course. Bas. Better a Dog fawne on me, then barke, Pist. Now sir, how likes thou this course. Bas. Their Launces were coucht to hie, And their Steedes ill borne. Pist. It may be so, it may be so, Sound to the second course. Now sir, how like you this course. Bas. Prettie, prettie, but not famous, Well for a learner, but not for a warriour. Pist. By my faith, me thought it was excellent. Bas. I in the eye of an infant, a Peacocks taile is glorious. Sound to the third course. Pist. O well run, the baye horsse with the blew taile, And the siluer knight, are both downe, By Cocke and Pie, and Mouse foote, The English man is a fine Knight. Bas. Now by the marble face of the Welkin, Hee is a braue warriour. Pist. What an oath is there, fie vpon thee extortioner. Bas. Now comes in the infant that courts my mistresse, Sound to the fourth course. Oh that my launce were in my rest, And my Beauer closd for this encounter. Pist. O well ran, my maister hath ouerthrown the Turke. Bas. Now fie vpon the Turke, To be dismounted by a Childe it vexeth me. Sound to the fift course. Pist. O wel run Maister, he hath ouerthrown the Frenchman. Bas. It is the fury of his horse, not the strength of his arme I would thou wouldst remit my oath, That I might assaile thy maister. Pist. I giue thee leaue, go to thy destruction, But syrra wheres thy horse? Bas. Why my Page stands holding him by the bridle. Pist. Well goe mount thee, goe. Bas. I go, and Fortune guide my Launce. Exit Basilisco. Pist. Take the braginst knaue in christendom with thee: Trulie I am sorrie for him, He iust like a knight, heele iustle like a Iade. It it a world to heere the foole prate and brag, He will iet as if it were a Goose on a greene: He goes many times supperles to bed, And yet he takes Phisick to make him leane. Last night he was bidden to a Gentlewomans to supper, And because he would not be put to carue, He wore his hand in a scarfe, and said he was wounded: He weares a coloured lath in his scabberd, And when twas found vpon him, he said he was wrathfull, He might not weare no iron. He weres Ciuet, And when it was askt him, where he had that muske, He said, all his kindred smelt so: Is not this a counterfet foole? Well ile vp and see how he speedes. Sound the sixt course, Now by the faith of a squire, he is a very faint knight, Why my maister hath ouerthrowne him And his Curtall, both to the ground, I shall haue olde laughing, It will be better then the Fox in the hole for me. Sound: Enter Phylippo, Erastus, Ferdinando, Lucina, and all the Knights. Cypr. Braue Gentlemen, by all your free consents, This Knight vnknowne, hath best demeand himselfe, According to the proclimation made, The prize and honor of the day is his, But now vnmaske thy selfe, that we may see, What warlike wrinckles time hath charactered, With ages print vpon thy warlike face. English. Accord to his request, braue man at armes, And let me see the face that vanquished me. French. Vnmaske thy selfe, thou well approoued knight. Turke. I long to see thy face braue warriour. Luci. Nay valiant sir, we may not be denide, Faire Ladies should be coye to showe their faces, Least that the sun should tan them with his beames, Ile be your page this once, for to disarme you. Pist. Thats the reason, that he shall helpe Your husband to arme his head, Oh the pollicie of this age is wonderfull. Phyllyp. What young Erastus, is it possible? Cipr. Erastus be thou honoured for this deed. English. So yong, and of such good accomplishment, Thriue faire beginner as this time doth promise, In vertue, valour, and all worthinesse: Giue me thy hand, I vowe my selfe thy friend. Erast. Thanks worthie sir, whose fauourable hand, Hath entred such a youngling in the warre, And thanks vnto you all, braue worthy sirs, Impose me taske, how I may do you good, Erastus will be dutifull in all. Phyl. Leaue protestations now, and let vs hie, To tread lauolto, that is womens walke, There spend we the remainder of the day. Exeunt. Manet Ferdinando. Ferdi. Though ouerborne, and foyled in my course, Yet haue I partners in mine infamie. Tis wondrous, that so yong a toward warriour, Should bide the shock of such approoued knights, As he this day hath matcht and mated too, But vertue should not enuie good desert, Therefore Erastus happy, and thy fortune, But my Lucina, how she changed her couler, When at the encounter I did loose a stirrop, Hanging her head as partner of my shame, Therefore will I now goe visit her, And please her with this Carcanet of worth, Which by good fortune I haue found to day, When valour failes, then gould must make the way. Exit. Enter Basilisco riding of a Mule. Bas. O cursed Fortune enemy to Fame, Thus to disgrace thy honoured name, By ouerthrowing him that far hath spred thy praise, Beyond the course of Titans burning raies, Enter Piston. Page set a side the iesture of my enemie, Giue him a Fidlers fee, and send him packing. Pist. Ho, God saue you sir, haue you burst your shin, Bas. I villaine, I haue broke my shin bone, My back bone, my channell bone, and my thigh bone, Beside two dossen small inferior bones. Pist. A shrewd losse by my faith sir, But wheres your coursers taile. Bas. He lost the same in seruice. Pist. There was a hot piece of seruice, where he lost his taile But how chance his nose is slit. Bas. For presumption, for couering the Emperors Mare. Pist. Marrie a foule fault, but why are his eares cut? Bas. For neighing in the Emperours Court. Pist. Why then thy Horse hath bin a Colt in his time, Bas. True, thou hast said. O touch not the cheeke of my Palphrey, Least he dismount me while my wounds are greene, Page, run, bid the surgion bring his incision. Yet stay ile ride along with thee my selfe. Exit. Pist. And ile beare you companie, Piston getteth vp on his Asse, and rideth with him to the doore, and meeteth the Cryer. Enter the Cryer. Pist. Come sirra, let me see how finely youle cry this chaine Cryer. Why what was it worth? Pist. It was woorth more, then thou and all thy kin are worth, Cryer. It may be so, but what must he haue that findes it? Pist. Why a hundred Crownes. Cryer. Why then ile haue ten for the crying it. Pist. Ten Crownes, and had but six pence, For crying a little wench of thirty yeares old &amp; vpwards, That had lost her selfe betwixt a tauerne &amp; a bawdie house. Cryer. I that was a wench, but this is Golde, Shee was poore, but this is rich. Pist. Why then by this reckoning, a Hackneyman Should haue ten shillings for horsing a Gentlewoman, Where he hath but ten pence of a begger. Cryer. VVhy and reason good, Let them paie, that best may, As the Lawyers vse their rich Clyents, VVhen they let the poore go vnder Forma pauperis. Pist. VVhy then I pray thee crie the Chaine for me, Sub forma pauperis, For money goes very low with me at this time. Cryer. I sir, but your maister is, though you be not. Pist. I but hee must not know That thou cryest the Chaine for me, I do but vse thee to saue me a labour, That am to make inquirie after it, Cry. Well sir, youle see me considered, will you not? Pist. I marry will I, why what lighter paiment can there be, then consideration. Cryer. O yes. Enter Erastus. Erastus. How now sirra, what are you crying? Cryer. A chaine sir, a chaine, that your man bad me crie. Erastus. Get you away sirra, I aduise you Meddle with no Chaines of mine, Exit Cryer. You paltrie knaue, how durst thou be so bould, To crie the chaine, when I bid thou shouldst not, Did I not bid thee onely vnderhand, Make priuie inquirie for it through the towne, Least publike rumor might aduertise her, Whose knowledge were to me a second death? Pist. Why would you haue me runne vp and downe the towne? and my shooes are doone. Erast. What you want in shooes, ile giue ye in blowes. Pist. I pray you sir hold your hands, And as I am an honest man, Ile do the best I can to finde your chaine. Exit Piston. Erast. Ah treacherous Fortune, enemy to Loue, Didst thou aduaunce me for my greater fall, In dalying war, I lost my chiefest peace, In hunting after praise, I lost my loue, And in loues shipwrack will my life miscarrie, Take thou the honor, and giue me the chaine, Wherein was linkt the sum of my delight. When she deliuered me the Carkanet, Keepe it quoth she, as thou wouldst keepe my selfe: I kept it not, and therefore she is lost, And lost with hir is all my happinesse, And losse of happines is worse then death. Come therefore gentle death and ease my griefe, Cut short what malice Fortune misintends, But stay a while good Death, and let me liue, Time may restore what Fortune tooke from me: Ah no, great losses sildome are restord. What if my Chaine shall neuer be restord, My innocence shall cleare my negligence. Ah! but my loue is cerimonious, And lookes for iustice at her louers hand, Within forst furrowes of her clowding brow, As stormes that fall amid a sun shine day, I read her iust desires, and my decay. Exit. Enter Solyman, Haleb, Amarath, and Janesaries. Soly. I long till Brusor be returnd from Rhodes, To know how he hath borne him gainst the Christians, That are assembled there to trie their valour, But more to be well assured by him, How Rhodes is fenc'd, and how I best may lay, My neuer failing siege to win that plot, For by the holy Alcaron I sweare, Ile call my Souldiers home from Persia, And let the Sophie breath, and from the Russian broiles Call home my hardie, dauntlesse Ianisaries, And from the other skirts of Christendome, Call home my Bassowes and my men of war, And so beleager Rhodes by sea and land. That Key will serue to open all the gates, Through which our passage cannot finde a stop, Till it haue prickt the hart of Christendome, Which now that paltrie Iland keepes from scath. Say brother Amurath, and Haleb, say, What thinke you of our resolution? Amura. Great Soliman, heauens onely substitute, And earths commander vnder Mahomet: So counsell I, as thou thy selfe hast said. Haleb. Pardon me dread Soueraigne, I hold it not Good pollicie, to call your forces home From Persea and Polonia, bending them Vpon a paltrie Ile of small defence. A common presse of base superfluous Turkes, May soone be leuied for so slight a taske. Ah Soliman, whose name hath shakt thy foes, As withered leaues with Autume throwen downe, Fog not thy glory with so fowle eclipse, Let not thy Souldiers sound a base retire, Till Persea stoope, and thou be conquerour. What scandall were it to thy mightinesse, After so many valiant Bassowes slaine, Whose bloud hath bin manured to their earth, Whose bones hath made their deepe waies passable. To sound a home ward, dull, and harsh retreate, Without a conquest, or a meane reuenge, Striue not for Rhodes, by letting Persea slip, The ones a Lyon almost brought to death, Whose skin will counteruaile the hunters toile; The other is a Waspe with threatning sting. Whose Hunny is not worth the taking vp. Amu. Why Haleb didst thou not heare our brother sweare Vpon the Alcaron religiously: That he would make an vniuersall Campe Of all his scattered legions: and darest thou Infer a reason why it is not meete, After his Highnes sweares it shall be so, VVere it not thou art my fathers sonne, And striuing kindnes wrestled not with ire, I would not hence, till I had let thee know, VVhat twere to thwart a Monarchs holy oath. Haleb. Why, his highnes gaue me leaue to speake my wil, And far from flattery I spoke my minde, And did discharge a faithfull subiects loue, Thou Aristippus like didst flatter him, Not like my brother, or a man of worth, And for his highnesse vowe I crost it not, But gaue my censure, as his highnesse bad, Now for thy chastisment, know Amurath, I scorne them as a rechlesse Lion scornes, The humming of a gnat in Summers night, Amur. I take it Haleb thou art friend to Rhodes. Haleb. Not halfe so much am I a friend to Rhodes, As thou art enemy to thy Soueraigne. Amur. I charge thee say wherein, or else by Mahomet, Ile hazard dutie in my Soueraignes presence. Haleb. Not for thy threats, but for my selfe I say, It is not meete, that one so base as thou, Shouldst come about the person of a King. Soli. Must I giue aime to this presumption? Amur. Your Highnesse knowes, I speake in dutious loue. Haleb. Your Highnes knowes I spake at your command, And to the purpose, far from flattery. Amu. Thinks thou I flatter, now I flatter not, Then he kils Haleb. Soli. What dismall Planets guides this fatall hower, Villaine, thy brothers grones do call for thee. Then Soliman kils Amurath. To wander with them through eternall night. Amu. Oh Soliman for louing thee I die, Soli. No Amurath, for murthering him thou dyest: Oh Haleb how shall I begin to mourne, Or how shall I begin to shed salt teares. For whom no wordes nor teares can well suffice. Ah that my rich imperiall Diadem, Could satisfie thy cruell destinie: Or that a thousand of our Turkish soules, Or twenty thousand millions of our foes, Could ransome thee from fell deaths tirannie, To win thy life would Soliman be poore, And liue in seruile bondage all my dayes, Accursed Amurath, that for a worthlesse cause, In bloud hath shortned our sweet Halebs dayes, Ah what is dearer bond then brotherhood, Yet Amurath thou wert my brother too, If wilfull folly did not blind mine eyes, I, I, and thou as vertuous as Haleb, And I as deare to thee as vnto Haleb, And thou as neere to me as Haleb was, Ah Amurath: why wert thou so vnkind to him For vttering but a thwarting word? And Haleb, why did not thy harts counsell, Bridle the fond intemperance of thy tongue? Nay wretched Solyman, why didst not thou Withhould thy hand, from heaping bloud on bloud, Might I not better spare one ioy then both, If loue of Haleb forst me on to wrath, Curst be that wrath that is the way to death, If iustice forst me on, curst be that iustice That makes the brother, Butcher of his brother, Come Ianisaries, and helpe me to lament, And beare my ioyes on either side of me: I, late my ioyes, but now my lasting sorrow, Thus, thus, let Soliman passe on his way, Bearing in either hand his hearts decay. Exeunt. Enter Chorus. Loue. Now Death and Fortune which of all vs three, Hath in the Actors showne the greatest power. Haue not I taught Erastus and Perseda, By mutuall tokens to seale vp their loues? Fortune. I but those tokens, the Ring and Carkanet, Were Fortunes gifts, Loue giues no gould or iewels: Loue. Why what is iewels, or what is gould but earth, An humor knit together by compression, And by the worlds bright eye, first brought to light, Onely to feed mens eyes with vaine delight. Loues workes are more then of a mortall temper, I couple minds together by consent. Who gaue Rhodes Princes to the Ciprian Prince: but Loue. For. Fortune that first by chance brought them together, For till by Fortune persons meete each other, Thou canst not teach their eyes to wound their hearts. Loue. I made those Knights of seuerall sect and countries Each one by armes to honor his beloued, For. Nay one alone to honor his beloued, The rest by turning of my tickle wheele, Came short in reaching of faire honors marke: I gaue Erastus onely that dayes prize, A sweete renowne, but mixt with bitter sorrow: For in conclusion of his happines, I made him loose the pretious Carcanet, Whereon depended all his hope and ioy. Death. And more then so: for he that found the chaine, Euen for that Chaine shall be depriued of life. Loue. Besides, Loue hath inforst a foole, The fond Bragardo to presume to armes. For. I but thou seest how he was ouerthrowne. By Fortunes high displeasure. Death. I and by Death had beene surprisd, If Fates had giuen me leaue: But what I mist in him and in the rest, I did accomplish on Haleb and Amurath, The worthie brethren of great Soliman, But wherefore stay we, let the sequele prooue, Who is greatest, Fortune, Death, or Loue. Exeunt. Enter Ferdinando and Lucina. Fer. As fits the time, so now well fits the place, To coole affection with our woords and lookes. If in our thoughts be semblance simpathie. Luci. My words, my lookes, my thoughts are all on thee. Ferdinando is Lucinaes onely ioy. Ferdi. What pledge thereof? Luci. An oath, a hand, a kisse. Ferdi. O holy oath, faire hand, and sugred kisse: Oh neuer may Fernando lack such blisse, But say my deare, when shall the gates of heauen? Stand all wide ope for celestiall Gods, With gladsome lookes to gase at Hymens robes. When shall the graces, or Lucinas hand, With Rosie chaplets deck thy golden tresses, And Cupid bring me to thy nuptiall bed, Where thou in ioy and pleasure must attend. A blisfull war with me thy chiefest friend. Lucina. Full fraught with loue, and burning with desire, I long haue longd for light of Hymens lights. Ferdi. Then that same day, whose warme &amp; pleasant sight, Brings in the spring, with many gladsome flowers, Be our first day of ioy and perfect peace: Till when, receiue this pretious Carcanet, In signe, that as these linkes are interlaced, So both our hearts are still combind in one, Which neuer can be parted but by death. Enter Basilisco and Perseda. Luci. And if I liue this shall not be forgot: But see Ferdinando where Perseda comes, Whom women loue for vertue, men for bewty, All the world loues, none hates but enuie. Bas. All haile braue Cauelere: God morrow Madam, The fairest shine that shall this day be seene. Except Persedas beautious excelence, Shame to loues Queene, and Empresse of my thoughts. Ferdi. Marry thrise happy is Persedas chance, To haue so braue a champion to hir Squire. Bas. Hir Squire: her Knight, and who so else denies, Shall feele the rigour of my Sword and Launce. Ferdi. O Sir, not I. Luci. Heres none but friends, yet let me chalenge you, For gracing me with a malignant stile, That I was fairest, and yet Perseda fayrer. We Ladies stand vpon our beauties much. Perse. Herein Lucina let me buckler him. Bas. Not Mars himselfe had eare so faire a Buckler. Perse. Loue makes him blinde, And blind can iudge no coulours. Luci. Why then the mends is made, and we still friends, Perse. Still friends, still foes, she weares my Carcanet, Ah false Erastus, how am I betraid. Luci. What ailes you madam, that your coulor changes. Perse. A suddaine qualme, I therefore take my leaue. Luci. Weele bring you home, Perse. No, I shall soone get home. Luci. Why then farewell: Fernando lets away. Exeunt Ferdinando and Lucina. Bas. Say worlds bright starre, Whence springs this suddaine change, Is it vnkindnes at the little praise I gaue Lucina with my glosing stile? Perse. No, no, her beautie far surpasseth mine, And from my neck, her neck hath woone the praise. Bas. What is it then, if loue of this my person, By fauour and by iustice of the heauens, At last haue percst through thy tralucent brest, And thou misdoubts, perhaps that ile proue coye, Oh be assur'd tis far from noble thoughts, To tyrannise ouer a yeelding foe. Therefore be blithe, sweete loue abandon feare, I will forget thy former crueltie. Perse. Ah false Erastus full of treachrie. Bas. I alwaies told you that such coward knights, VVere faithlesse swaines and worthie no respect, But tell me sweete loue, what is his offence? That I with words and stripes may chastice him, And bring him bound for thee to tread vpon. Perse. Now must I find the meanes to rid him hence, Go thou foorthwith arme thee from top to toe, And come an houre hence vnto my lodging, Then will I tell thee this offence at large, And thou in my behalfe shalt worke reuenge. Bas. I thus should men of valour be imployd, This is good argument of thy true loue, I go, make reconing that Erastus dyes, Vnlesse forewarnd, the weakoning coward flies, Exit Basilisco. Per. Thou foolish coward flies. Erastus liues, The fayrest shape, but fowlest minded man, That ere sunne saw within our hemyspheare, My tongue to tell my woes is all to weake, I must vnclaspe me, or my heart will breake: But inward cares are most pent in with greefe, Vnclasping therefore yeeldes me no releefe. Ah that my moystand cloud compacted braine, Could spend my cares in showers of weeping raine. But scalding sighes like blasts of boysterous windes, Hinder my teares from falling on the ground, And I must die by closure of my wound. Ah false Erastus, how had I misdoone, That thou shouldst quit my loue with such a scorne. Enter Erastus. Here comes the Synon to my simple hart, Ile frame my selfe to his dissembling art. Erast. Desire perswades me on, feare puls me back. Tush I will to her, innocence is bould, How fares Perseda my sweete second selfe? Perse. Well, now Erastus my hearts onely ioy Is come to ioyne both hearts in vnion. Erast. And till I came whereas my loue did dwell, My pleasure was but paine, my solace woe. Per. What loue meanes my Erastus, pray thee tell? Erast. Matchlesse Perseda, she that gaue me strength, To win late conquest from many victors hands, Thy name was conquerour, not my chiualrie: Thy lookes did arme me, not my coate of steele, Thy beautie did defend me, not my force. Thy fauours bore me, not my light foote Steed, Therefore to thee I owe both loue and life. But wherefore makes Perseda such a doubt, As if Erastus could forget himselfe: Which if I do, all vengeance light on me. Perse. Aye me, how gracelesse are these wicked men? I can no longer hould my patience. Ah how thine eyes can forge alluring lookes, And faine deepe oathes to wound poore sillie maides, Are there no honest drops in all thy cheekes, To check thy fraudfull countenance with a blush: Calst thou me loue, and louest another better, If heauens were iust, thy teeth would teare thy tongue, For this thy periurde false disloialtie. If heauens were iust, men should haue open brests, That we therein might read their guilefull thoughts. If heauens were iust, that power that forceth loue, Would neuer couple Woolues and Lambes together. Yes, heauens are iust, but thou art so corrupt, That in thee, all their influence dooth change, As in the Spider good things turne to poyson. Ah false Erastus, how had I misdone? That thou shouldst pawne my true affections pledge, To her whose worth will neuer equall mine. What, is Lucinaes wealth exceeding mine? Yet mine sufficient to encounter thine. Is she more faire then I? thats not my fault, Nor her desart: whats beauty but a blast? Soone cropt with age, or with infirmities. Is she more wise? her yeares are more then mine, What ere she be? my loue was more then hers, And for her chastitie let others iudge. But what talke I of her? the fault is thine, If I were so disgratious in thine eye, That she must needes inioy my interest, Why didst thou deck her with my ornament? Could nothing serue her but the Carcanet? Which as my life I gaue to thee in charge, Couldst thou abuse my true simplicitie? Whose greatest fault was ouer louing thee, Ile keepe no tokens of thy periury. Heere giue her this, Perseda now is free, And all my former loue is turnd to hate. Erast. Ah stay my sweete Perseda heare me speake. Perse. What are thy words? but Syrens guilefull songs: That please the eare, but seeke to spoile the heart. Erast. Then view my teares, that plead for innocence, Perse. VVhat are thy teares? but Circes magike seas, VVhere none scape wrackt, but blindfould Marriners. Erast. If words &amp; teares displease, then view my lookes, That plead for mercy at thy rigorous hands. Perse. VVhat are thy lookes? but like the Cockatrice, That seekes to wound poore silly passengers. Erast. If words, nor teares, nor lookes, may win remorse, VVhat then remaines for my perplexed heart? Hath no interpreters but words, or teares, or lookes. Perse. And they are all as false as thou thy selfe. Exit Perseda. Erast. Hard doome of death before my case be knowne, My iudge vniust, and yet I cannot blame her, Since Loue and iealousie mislead her thus. My selfe in fault, and yet not worthie blame, Because that Fortune made the fault, not Loue. The ground of her vnkindnes growes, because I lost The pretious Carcanet she gaue to me: Lucina hath it, as her words import, But how she got it, heauens knowes, not I, Yet this is some aleagement to my sorrow, That if I can but get the Chaine againe, I bouldly then shall let Perseda know, That she hath wrongd Erastus and her frend: Ah Loue, and if thou beest of heauenly power, Inspire me with some present stratagem, It must be so, Lucinas a franke Gaimster, And like it is, in plaie sheele hazard it, For if report but blasen her aright, Shees a franke gaimster, and inclinde to play, Ho Piston? Enter Piston. Pist. Heere sir, what would you with me, Era. Desire Guelpio &amp; signior Iulio come speake with me And bid them bring some store of crownes with them, And sirra, prouide me foure Visards, Foure Gownes, a boxe, and a Drumme, For I intend to go in mummery, Pist. I will sir. Exit Piston. Erast. Ah vertuous Lampes of euer turning heauens, Incline her minde to play, and mine to win, Nor do I couet but what is mine owne, Then shall I let Perseda vnderstand, How iealousie had armd her tongue with malice, Ah were she not Perseda whom my heart, No more can flie, then iron can Adamant, Her late vnkindnes would haue chaunged my minde. Enter Guelpio and Iulio and Piston. Guelp. How now Erastus, wherein may we pleasure thee? Erast. Sirs thus it is, we must in mummerie, Vnto Lucina, neither for loue nor hate, But if we can, to win the chaine she weares, For though I haue some interest therein, Fortune may make me maister of mine owne, Rather then ile seeke iustice gainst the Dame, But this assure your selues it must be mine, By game, or change, by one deuise or other. The rest ile tell you when our sport is doone. Iulio. VVhy then lets make vs ready and about it, Erast. VVhat store of Crownes haue you brought? Guel. Feare not for money man, ile beare the Boxe, Iulio. I haue some little replie, if neede require. Pist. I but heare you Maister, was not he a foole? That went to shoote, and left his arrowes behinde him. Erast. Yes, but what of that? Pist. Mary that you may loose your money, And go without the chaine, vnlesse you carrie false dice. Guel. Mas the foole sayes true, lets haue some got. Pist. Nay I vse not to go without a paire of false Dice. Heere are tall men and little men. Iulio. Hie men and low men, thou wouldst say. Erast. Come sirs lets go, Drumsler pray for me, And ile reward thee: and sirra Pistrn, Mar not our sport with your foolery. Pist. I warrant you sir, they get not one wise word of me, Sound vp the Drum to Lucinaes doore. Enter Lucina. Luci. I marrie, this showes that Charleman is come, What shall we play heere? content, Since Signior Ferdinand will haue it so. Then they play, and when she hath lost her gold, Erastus pointed to her Chaine, and then she sayd: I were it Cleopatraes vnion: Then Erastus winneth the Chaine, and looseth his gould. And Lucina saies. Signior Fernando, I am sure tis you, And Gentlemen, vnmaske ere you depart, That I may know to whom my thankes is due, For this so courteous and vnlookt for sport: No wilt not be, then sup with me to morrow, Well then ile looke for you, till then farewell. Exit Lucina. Erast. Gentlemen, each thing hath sorted to our wish, She tooke me for Fernando, markt you that: Your gould shall be repairde with double thankes, And fellow Drumsler, ile reward you well. Pist. But is there no reward for my false dice? Erast. Yes sir, a garded sute from top to toe. Enter Ferdinando. Ferdi. Dasell mine eyes, or ist Lucinas chaine, False treacher, lay downe the chaine that thou hast stole, Erast. He lewdly lyes that cals me treacherous. Fern. That lye my weapon shall put downe thy throate: Then Erastus slaies Ferdinando. Julio. Flie Erastus, ere the Gouernour haue any newes, Whose neere alye he was, and cheefe delight, Erast. Nay Gentlemen, flie you and saue yourselues, Least you pertake the hardnes of my fortune. Exeunt Guelpio and Iulio. Ah fickle and blind guidresse of the world, What pleasure hast thou in my miserie? Wast not enough when I had lost the Chaine, Thou didst bereaue me of my dearest loue, But now when I should reposesse the same, To crosse me with this haplesse accedent: Ah if but time and place would giue me leaue, Great ease it were for me to purge my selfe, And to acuse fell Fortune, Loue and Death. For all these three conspire my tragedie, But danger waites vppon my words and steps, I dare not stay, for if the Gouernour Surprise me heere, I die by marshall law, Therefore I go, But whether shall I go? If into any stay adioyning Rhodes, They will betray me to Phyllippos hands, For loue, or gaine, or flatterie. To Turkie must I go, the passage short, The people warlike, and the king renownd, For all heroyicall and kingly vertues, Ah hard attempt, to tempt a foe for ayde, Necessitie yet sayes it must be so, Or suffer death for Ferdinandos death, Whom honors title forst me to misdoe, By checking his outragious insolence. Piston, heere take this chaine, and giue it to Perseda, And let her know what hath befallen me, When thou hast deliuered it, take ship and follow me, I will be in Constantinople. Farewell my countrie dearer then my life; Farewell sweete friends, dearer then countrey soyle, Farewell Perseda, dearest of them all, Dearer to me, then all the world besides. Exit Erastus. Pist. Now am I growing into a doubtfull agonie What I were best to do, to run away with this Chaine, Or deliuer it, and follow my maister. If I deliuer it and follow my maister, I shall haue thanks. But they will make me neuer the fatter, If I run away with it, I may liue vpon credit All the while I weare this chaine, Or dominere with the money when I haue sold it, Hetherto all goes well, but if I be taken, I marry sir, then the case is altered, I and haltered to, Of all things I do not loue to preach With a haulter about my neck, Therfore for this once, ile be honest against my will, Perseda shall haue it, but before I go, ile be so bolde As to diue into this Gentlemans pocket, for good luck sake, If he deny me not: how say you sir, are you content? A plaine case, Qui tacet consitiri videtur. Enter Phylippo and Iulio. Iulio. See where his body lyes. Philip. I, I, I see his body all to soone, What barbarous villaine ist that rifles him. Ah Ferdinand, the stay of my old age, And cheefe remainder of our progenie, Ah louing cousen how art thou misdone, By false Erastus, ah no by treacherie, For well thy valour hath beene often tride, But whilst I stand and weepe, and spend the time In fruitlesse plaints, the murtherer will escape, VVithout reuenge, sole salue for such a sore, Say villaine, wherefore didst thou rifle him? Pist. Faith sir for pure good will, Seeing he was going towards heauen, I thought to see, if he had a pasport to S. Nicholas or no, Philip. Some sot he seemes to be, twere pittie to hurt him: Sirra canst thou tell who slew this man? Pist. I sir very well, it was my maister Erastus. Philp. Thy maister, and whether is he gone now? Pist. To fetch the Sexten to burie him I thinke. Phil. Twere pittie to imprison such a sot, Pist. Now it fits my wisdome to counterfeit the foole. Phil. Come hether sirra, thou knowest me For the Gouernour of the cittie, doost thou not? Pist. I forsooth sir. Phil. Thou art a bondman, and wouldst faine be free? Pist. I forsooth sir. Phil. Then do but this, and I will make thee free, And rich wiihall, learne where Erastus is, And bring me word, and ile reward thee well. Pist. That I will sir, I shall finde you at the Castle, shall I not? Phil. Yes. Pist. Why ile be here, as soone as euer I come againe. Exit Piston. Phil. But for assurance that he may not scape, VVeele lay the ports and hauens round about, And let a proclamation straight be made, That he that can bring foorth the murtherer, Shall haue three thousand Duckets for his paines, My selfe will see the body borne from hence, And honored with Balme and funerall. Exit. Enter Piston. Pist. God sends fortune to fooles. Did you euer see wise man escape as I haue done, I must betraie my maister: I but when can you tell? Enter Perseda. See where Perseda comes, to saue me a labour. After my most hearty commendations, This is to let you vnderstand, That my maister was in good health at the sending hereof, Yours for euer and euer and euer. In most humble wise Piston. Then he deliuered her the Chaine. Perse. This makes me thinke that I haue been to cruell, How got he this from of Lucinas arme? Pist. Faith in a mummery, and a paire of false dice, I was one of the mummers my selfe, simple as I stand here. Perse. I rather thinke it cost him very deare. Pist. I so it did, for it cost Ferdinando his life. Perse. How so? Pyst. After we had got the chaine in mummery, And lost our box in counter cambio, My maister wore the chaine about his necke, Then Ferdinando met vs on the way, And reuild my maister, saying he stole the chaine, With that they drew, &amp; there Ferdinando had the prickado. Perse. And whether fled my poore Erastus then? Pist. To Constantinople whether I must follow him, But ere he went, with many sighes and teares, He deliuered me the chaine, and bad me giue it you, For perfect argument that he was true, And you too credulous. Perse. Ah stay, no more, for I can heere no more. Pist. And I can sing no more. Perse. My hart had armd my tongue with iniury, To wrong my friend, whose thoughts were euer true, Ah poore Erastus how thy starres maling: Thou great commander of the swift wingd winds, And dreadfull Neptune bring him backe againe, But Eolus and Neptune let him go, For heere is nothing but reuenge and death, Then let him go, ile shortly follow him, Not with slow sailes, but with loues goulden winges, My ship shall be borne with teares, and blowne with sighes So will I soare about the Turkish land, Vntill I meete Erastus my sweete freend. And then and there, fall downe amid his armes, And in his bosome there power foorth my soule, For satisfaction of my trespasse past. Enter Basilisco, armde. Basi. Faire Loue, according vnto thy commaund, I seeke Erastus and will combate him. Perse. I seeke him, finde him, bring him to my sight, For till we meete, my hart shall want delight. Exit Perseda. Basi. My petty fellow, where hast thou hid thy maister, Pist. Marrie sir in an Armorours shop, Where you had not best go to him. Basi. Why so, I am in honour bound to combat him, Pist. I sir, but he knowing your fierce conditions, Hath planted a double cannon in the doore, Ready to discharge it vppon you, when you go by, I tell you for pure good will. Basi. In Knightly curtesie, I thanke thee, But hopes the coystrell to escape me so, Thinkes he bare cannon shot can keepe me back: Why wherfore serues my targe of proofe, but for the bullet That once put by, I roughly come vpon him, Like to the wings of lightning from aboue, I with a martiall looke astonish him, Then fals he downe poore wretch vpon his knee, And all to late, repents his surquedry. Then do I take him on my fingers point, And thus I beare him thorough euery streete, To be a laughing stock to all the towne. That done, I lay him at my mistres feete, For her to giue him doome of life or death. Pist. I but heere you sir, I am bound In paine of my maisters displeasure, To haue about at cuffes, afore you and I part, Basi. Ha, ha, ha, Eagles are chalenged by paltry flyes, Thy folly giues thee priuiledge, begon, begon, Pist. No, no sir, I must haue about with you sir thats flat, That for retaining one so vertuous, Least my maister turne me out of seruice. Basi. Why, art thou wearie of thy life? Pist. No by my faith sir. Basi. Then fetch thy weapons, and with my single fist, Ile combat thee, my body all vnarmd. Pist. Why lend me thine, and saue me a labour. Basi. I tell thee, if Alcides liued this day, He could not weild my weapons. Pist. Why wilt thou stay till I come againe? Basi. I vpon my honour. Pist. That shall be when I come from Turkey. Exit Pist. Basi. Is this little desperate fellow gon, Doubtlesse he is a very tall fellow, And yet it were disgrace to all my chiualrie, To combate one so base: Ile send some Crane to combate with the Pigmew, Not that I feare, but that I scorne to fight. Exit Basilis. Enter Chorus. Loue. Fortune thou madest Fernando finde the chaine, But yet by Loues instruction he was taught, To make a present of it to his Mistris, For. But Fortune would not let her keepe it long. Loue. Nay rather Loue, by whose suggisted power, Erastus vsde such dice, as being false, Ran not by Fortune, but necessitie. Fort. Meane time I brought Fernando on the way, To see and chalenge what Lucina lost. Death. And by that chalenge I abridgde his life, And forst Erastus into banishment, Parting him from his loue, in spight of Loue, Loue. But with my goulden winges ile follow him, And giue him aide and succour in distresse. Fort. And doubt not to, but Fortune will be there, And crosse him too, and sometimes flatter him, And lift him vp, and throw him downe againe. Death. And here and there in ambush Death will stand, To marre what Loue or Fortune takes in hand. Exeunt. Enter Solyman and Brusor, with Janisaries. Soly. How long shall Soliman spend his time, And waste his dayes in fruitlesse obsequies, Ads but a trouble to my brothers ghost: Perhaps my greefe and long continuall moane, Which but for me would now haue tooke their rest, Then farewell sorrow, and now reuenge draw neere. In controuersie touching the Ile of Rhodes, My brothers dyde, on Rhodes ile he reuengd, Now tell me Brusor whats the newes at Rhodes? Hath the yong prince of Cipris married Cornelia, daughter to the Gouernour. Bru. He hath my Lord, with the greatest pompe, That ere I saw at such a festiuall. Soli. What greater then at our coronation? Bru. Inferiour to that onely. Soli. At tilt, who woone the honor of the day? Bru. A worthie Knight of Rhodes, a matchlesse man, His name Erastus, not twentie yeares of age, Not tall, but well proportioned in his lims, I neuer saw, except your excellence, A man whose presence more delighted me, And had he worshipt Mahomet for Christ, He might haue borne me through out all the world, So well I loued and honoured the man. Soli. These praises Brusor touch me to the heart, And makes me wish that I had beene at Rhodes, Vnder the habit of some errant knight, Both to haue seene and tride his valour. Brusor. You should haue seene him foile and ouerthrow, All the Knights that there incountred him. Soli. What ere he be, euen for his vertues sake, I wish that fortune of our holy wars, Would yeeld him prisoner vnto Soliman: We may our selues be famd for vertues. But let him passe, and Brusor tell me now, How did the Christians vse our Knights? Bru. As if that we and they had beene on sect, Soli. What thinkst thou of their valour and demeanor? Bru. Braue men at armes, and friendly out of armes, Courteous in peace, in battell dangerous, Kinde to their foes, and liberall to their friends, And all in all, their deedes heroicall. Soli. Then tell me Brusor, how is Rhodes fenst, For eyther Rhodes shall be braue Solymans, Or cost me more braue Souldiers Then all that Ile will beare. Brusor. Their fleete is weake: Their horsse, I deeme them fiftie thousand strong, Their footemen more, well exercised in war, And as it seemes, they want no needfull vittaile. Soli. How euer Rhodes be fencd by sea or land, It eyther shall be mine, or burie me: Enter Erastus. Whats he that thus bouldly enters in? His habite argues him a Christian, Erast. I worthie Lord a forlorne Christian. Soli. Tell me man, what madnes brought thee hether? Erast. Thy vertuous fame, and mine owne miserie. Soli. What miserie? speake, for though you Christians, Account our Turkish race but barbarous, Yet haue we eares to heare a iust complaint, And iustice to defend the innocent, And pitie, to such as are in pouertie, And liberall hands to such as merit bountie, Bru. My gratious Soueraigne, as this Knight, Seemes by greefe tyed to silence, So his deserts binds me to speake for him. This is Erastus the Rhodian worthie, The flower of chiualrie and curtesie. Soli. Is this the man that thou hast so describde? Stand vp faire knight, that what my heart desires, Mine eyes may view with pleasure and delight, This face of thine should harbour no deceit. Erastus ile not yet vrge to know the cause, That brought thee hether, Least with the discourse, thou shouldst afflict thy selfe, And crosse the fulnes of my ioyfull passion, But that we are assurde, Heauens brought thee hether for our benefit, Know thou that Rhodes, nor all that Rhodes containes, Shall win thee from the side of Soliman, If we but finde thee well inclind to vs. Erast. If any ignoble or dishonourable thoughts, Should dare attempt, or but creepe neere my heart: Honour should force disdaine to roote it out, As ayre bred Eagles, if they once perceiue, That any of their broode but close their sight, When they should gase against the glorious Sunne, They straight way sease vpon him with their talents, That on the earth it may vntimely die, For looking but a scue at heauens bright eye. Soli. Erastus, to make thee well assurde, How well thy speach and presents liketh vs, Aske what thou wilt, it shall be graunted thee. Erast. Then this my gratious Lord is all I craue, That being banisht from my natiue soile, I may haue libertie to liue a Christian. Soly. I that, or any thing thou shalt desire, Thou shalt be Captaine of our Ianisaries, And in our counsell shalt thou sit with vs, And be great Solimans adopted freend. Erast. The least of these surpasse my best desart, Vnlesse true loyaltie may seeme desart. Soli. Erastus, now thou hast obtaind thy boone, Denie not Soliman this owne request; A vertuous enuie pricks me with desire, To trie thy valour, say art thou content? Erast. I, if my Soueraigne say content, I yeeld. Soli. Then giue vs Swords and Targets, And now Erastus thinke me thine enemie, But euer after thy continuall friend, And spare me not, for then thou wrongst my honour. Then they fight, and Erastus ouercomes Solyman. Nay, nay Erastus, throw not downe thy weapons, As if thy force did faile, it is enough That thou hast conquered Soliman by strength, By curtesie let Soliman conquer thee. And now from armes to counsell sit thee downe: Before thy comming I vowd to conquer Rhodes, Say wilt thou be our Leiutenant there, And further vs in manage of these wars? Erast. My gratious Soueraigne, without presumption, If poore Erastus may once more intreat, Let not great Solimans commaund, To whose behest I vowe obedience, Inforce me sheath my slaughtering blade, In the deere bowels of my countrimen: And were it not that Soliman hath sworne, My teares should plead for pardon to that place: I speake not this to shrinke away for feare, Or hide my head in time of dangerous stormes, Imploy me else where in thy forraine wars, Against the Persians or the barbarous Moore, Erastus will be formost in the battell. Soli. Why fauourst thou thy countrimen so much, By whose crueltie thou art exylde? Erast. Tis not my countrey, but Phylippos wrath, It must be tould, for Ferdinandos death, Whom I in honours cause haue reft of life, Soli. Nor suffer this or that to trouble thee, Thou shalt not neede Phylippo nor his Ile, Nor shalt thou war against thy Countrimen, I like thy vertue in refusing it, But that our oath may haue his currant course, Brusor, goe leuie men, Prepare a fleete, to assault and conquer Rhodes, Meane time Erastus and I will striue, By mutuall kindnes to excell each other. Brusor be gon, and see not Soliman, Till thou hast brought Rhodes in subiection. Exit Brusor. And now Erastus come and follow me. Where thou shalt see what pleasures and what sports, My Minions and my Euenukes can deuise, To driue away this melancholly moode. Exit Soliman. Enter Piston. Pist. Oh maister, see where I am, Erast. Say Piston whats the newes at Rhodes, Pist. Colde and comfortlesse for you, Will you haue them all at once? Erastus. I. Pist. Why the Gouernour will hang you &amp; he catch you. Ferdinando is buried, your friends commend them to you: Perseda hath the chaine, and is like to die for sorrow. Erast. I thats the greefe, that we are parted thus. Come follow me and I will heare the rest, For now I must attend the Emperour. Exeunt. Enter Perseda, Lucina, and Basilisco. Perse. Accursed Chaine, vnfortunate Perseda. Luci. Accursed Chaine, vnforrunate Lucina, My friend is gone, and I am desolate. Perse. My friend is gone, and I am desolate, Returne him backe faire starres or let me die. Luci. Returne him back faire heauens, or let me die, For what was he but comfort of my life? Perse. For what was he but comfort of my life? But why was I so carefull of the Chaine. Luci. But why was I so carelesse of the chaine, Had I not lost it, my friend had not beene slaine. Perse. Had I not askt it, my friend had not departed, His parting is my death. Luci. His deaths my liues departing, And here my tongue dooth stay, with swolne harts greefe, Per. And here my swolne harts greef doth stay my tongue. Basi. For whom weepe you? Luci. Ah, for Fernandos dying. Basi. For whom mourne you? Perse. Ah, for Erastus flying, Basi. Why Lady is not Basilisco here? Why Lady dooth not Basilisco liue? Am not I worth both these for whom you mourne: Then take one halfe of me, and cease to weepe, Or if you gladly would inioy me both, Ile serue the one by day, the other by night, And I will pay you both your sound delight. Luci. Ah how vnpleasant is mirth to melancholy. Perse. My heart is full, I cannot laugh at follie. Exeunt Ladies. Basi. See, see, Lucina hates me like a Toade, Because that when Erastus spake my name, Her loue Fernando died at the same, So dreadfull is our name to cowerdice. On the other side, Perseda takes it vnkindly, That ere he went I brought not bound vnto her, Erastus that faint hearted run away: Alasse how could I, for his man no sooner Informd him, that I sought him vp and downe, But he was gon in twinckling of an eye: But I will after my delitious loue, For well I wot, though she desemble thus, And cloake affection with hir modestie, With loue of me her thoughts are ouer gone, More then was Phillis with hir Demophon. Exit. Enter Philippo, the Prince of Cipris, with other Souldiours. Phil. Braue prince of Cipris, and our sonne in law, Now there is little time to stand and talke, The Turkes haue past our Gallies and are landed, You with some men at armes shall take the Tower, I with the rest will downe vnto the strane: If we be beaten back weele come to you, And here in spight of damned Turkes, weele gaine A glorious death or famous victorie. Cyp. About it then. Exeunt. Enter Brusor, and his Souldiers. Bru. Drum sound a parle to the Citttzens. The Prince of Cypres on the walles. Cyp. What parle craues the Turkish at our hands. Bru. We come with mightie Solimans commaund, Monarch and mightie Emperor of the world, From East to Weast, from South, to Septentrion, If you resist, expect what warre affordes, Mischiefe, murther, bloud, and extremitie, What wilt thou yeeld and trie our clemencie? Say I, or no; for we are peremtorie. Cyp. Your Lord vsurps in all that he posesseth, And that great God which we do truly worship, Shall strengthen vs against your insolence. Bru. Now if thou plead for mercie, tis to late: Come fellow Souldiers, let vs to the breach, Thats made already on the other side. Exeunt, to the batel. Phylippo and Cipris are both slaine. Enter Brusor, with Souldiers, hauing Guelpio, Iulio, and Basilisco, with Perseda and Lucina prisoners. Bru. Now Rhodes is yoakt, and stoopes to Soliman, There lies the Gouernour, and there his sonne: Now let their soules tell sorrie tidings to their ancestors, What millions of men opprest with ruine and scath, The Turkish armies did in Christendome, What say these prisoners, will they turne Turke, or no? Iulio. First Iulio will die ten thousand deaths. Guel. And Guelpio, rather then denie his Christ. Bru. Then stab the slaues, and send their soules to hell. They stab Iulio and Guelpio. Bas. I turne, I turne, oh saue my life I turne. Bru. Forbeare to hurt him: when we land in Turkie He shall be circumcised and haue his rites. Bas. Thinke you I turne Turque, For feare of seruile death thats but a sport, I faith sir no: Tis for Perseda whom I loue so well, That I would follow her, though she went to hell. Bru. Now for these Ladies: their liues priuiledge Hangs on their beautie, they shall be preserued, To be presented to great Soliman, The greatest honour Fortune could affoord. Perse. The most dishonour that could ere befall. Exeunt. Enter Chorus. Lou. Now Fortune, what hast thou done in this later passage For. I plast Erastus in the fauour, Of Solyman the Turkish Emperour. Loue. Nay that was Loue, for I coucht my selfe In poore Erastus eyes, and with a looke Orespred with teares, bewitched Solyman, Beside I sat on valiant Brusors tongue, To guide the praises of the herodian knight. Then in the Ladies passions, I showed my power, And lastly Loue made Basiliscos tongue, To countercheck his hart by turning Turke, And saue his life, in spight of deaths despight. Death. How chance it then, that Loue and Fortunes power Could neither saue Philippo nor his sonne, Nor Guelpio, nor signior Iulio, Nor rescue Rhodes from out the hands of Death. For. Why Brusors victorie was Fortunes gift. Death. But had I slept, his conquest had beene small. Loue. Wherfore stay we, thers more behind, which proues That though Loue winke, Loues not starke blinde. Exeunt. Enter Erastus and Piston. Pist. Faith maister, me thinks you are vnwise. That you weare not the high Sugerloafe hat, And the gilded gowne the Emperour gaue you, Erast. Peace foole, a sable weede fits discontent, Away, be gon. Pist. Ile go prouide your supper, A shoulder of mutton, and neuer a Sallet. Exit Piston. Erast. I must confesse that Solyman is kinde, Past all compare, and more then my desart, But what helps gay garments, when the minds oprest, What pleaseth the eye, when the sence is altered, My heart is ouerwhelmd with thousand woes, And melancholie leades my soule in triumphe, No meruaile then if I haue little minde, Of rich imbroderie or costly ornaments, Of honors titles, or of wealth, or gaine, Of musick, viands, or of dainty dames, No, no, my hope full long agoe was lost, And Rhodes it selfe is lost, or els destroyde, If not destroide, yet bound and captiuate, If captiuate, then forst from holy faith: If forst from faith, for euer miserable, For what is misery, but want of God, And God is lost, if faith be ouerthrowne. Enter Solyman. Solim. Why how now Erastus, alwaies in thy dumpes? Still in black habite fitting funerall? Cannot my loue perswade thee from this moode, Nor all my faire intreats and blandishments, Wert thou my friend, thy minde would iumpe with mine, For what are freends, but one minde in two bodies. Perhaps thou doubts my friendships constancie, Then doost thou wrong the measure of my loue, Which hath no measure, and shall neuer end, Come Erastus sit thee downe by me, And ile impart to thee our Brusors newes, Newes to our honour, and to thy content: The Gouernour is slaine that sought thy death. Erast. A worthy man though not Erastus friend, Soli. The Prince of Cipris to, is likewise slaine. Erast. Faire blossome, likely to haue proued good fruite. Soli. Rhodes is taken, and all the men are slaine. Except some few that turne to Mahomet. Erast. I there it is, now all my freends are slaine, And faire Perseda murtherd or deflowerd. Ah gratious Solyman now show thy loue, In not denying thy poore sypplyant: Suffer me not to stay here in thy presence, But by my selfe lament me once for all, Here if I stay, I must suppresse my teares, And teares supprest will but increase my sorrow. Soli. Go then, go spend thy mournings all at once, That in thy presence Soliman may ioy. Exit Erastus. For hetherto haue I reaped little pleasure, Well well Erastus, Rhodes may blesse thy birth, For his sake onely will I spare them more, From spoile, pillage, and oppression, Then Alexander spard warlike Thebes For Pindarus: or then Augustus Sparde rich Alexandria for Arias sake. Enter Brusor, Perseda, and Lucina. Bru. My gratious Lord, reioyce in happinesse: All Rhodes is yoakt, and stoopes to Solyman. Soli. First thanks to heauen, and next to Brusors valour, Which ile not guerdon with large promises, But straight reward thee with a bounteous largesse: But what two Christian Virgins haue we here? Bru. Part of the spoile of Rhodes, which were preserued To be presented to your mightinesse. Soli. This present pleaseth more then all the rest, And were their garments turnd from black to white, I should haue deemd them Junoes goodly Swannes, Or Venus milke white Doues, so milde they are, And so adornd with beauties miracle. Heere Brusor this kinde Turtle shall be thine, Take her and vse her at thy pleasure: But this kinde Turtle is for Soliman, That her captiuitie may turne to blisse. Faire lookes resembling PhÅbus radiant beames, Smooth forhead like the table of high Ioue, Small pensild eye browes, like to glorious rainbowes, Quicke lampelike eyes, like heauens two brightest orbes, Lips of pure Corall breathing Ambrosie, Cheekes, where the Rose and Lillie are incombate, Necke whiter then the Snowie Apenines, Brests like two ouerflowing Fountaines, Twixt which a vale leads to the Elisian shades, Where vnder couert lies the fount of pleasure, Which thoughts may gesse, but tongue must not prophane. A sweeter creature nature neuer made, Loue neuer tainted Solyman till now, Now faire Virgin let me heare thee speake. Perse. What can my tongue vtter, but greefe and death. Soli. The sound is hunnie, but the sence is gall: Then sweeting blesse me with a cheerefull looke. Perse. How can mine eyes dart foorth a pleasant looke, When they are stopt with flouds of flowing teares. Soli. If tongue with griefe, and eyes with teares be fild, Say Virgin, how dooth thy heart admit, The pure affection of great Soliman? Perse. My thoughts are like pillers of Adamant, Too hard to take an new impression. Soli. Nay then I see my stooping makes her proud, She is my vassaile, and I will commaund, Coye Virgin knowest thou what offence it is, To thwart the will and pleasure of a king? Why thy life is doone, if I but say the word. Perse. Why thats the period that my heart desires. Soli. And die thou shalt, vnlesse thou change thy minde. Perse. Nay then Perseda growes resolute, Solimans thoughts and mine resemble, Liues paralise that neuer can be ioyned. Soli. Then kneele thou downe, And ar my hands receiue the stroake of death, Domde to thy selfe by thine owne wilfulnes. Per. Strike, strike, thy words pierce deeper then thy blows. Soli. Brusor hide her, for her lookes withhould me, Then Brusor hides her with a Lawne. O Brusor thou hast not hid her lippes, For there sits Venus with Cupid on her knee, And all the Graces smiling round about her, So crauing pardon that I cannot strike. Bru. Her face is couerd ouer quite my Lord. Soli. Why, so. O Brusor, seest thou not her milke white neck, That Alablaster tower, Twill breake the edge of my keene Semitor, And peeces flying back will wound my selfe. Bru. Now she is all couered my Lord. Soli. Why now at last she dyes. Perse. O Christ receiue my soule. Soli. Harke Brusor she cals on Christ, I will not send her to him, Her wordes are musick, The selfe same musick that in auncient dayes, Brought Alexander from warre to banquetting, And made him fall from skirmishing to kissing. No my deare Loue would not let me kill thee, Though Maiestie would turne desire to wrath, There lyes my sword, humbled at thy feete, And I my selfe that gouerne many kings, Intreate a pardon for my rash misdeede. Perse. Now Soliman wrongs his imperiall state, But if thou loue me, and haue hope to win, Graunt me one boone that I shall craue of thee, Soli. What ere it be, Perseda I graunt it thee, Perse. Then let me liue a Christian Virgin still, Vnlesse my state shall alter by my will, Soli. My word is past, and I recall my passions, What should he do with crowne and Emperie, That cannot gouerne priuate fond affections, Yet giue me leaue in honest sort to court thee, To ease, though not to cure, my maladie: Come sit thee downe vpon my right hand here, This seate I keepe voide for another friend: Go Ianisaries call in your Gouernour, So shall I ioy betweene two captiue friends, And yet my selfe be captiue to them both, If friendships yoake were not at libertie: See where he comes my other best beloued. Enter Erastus. Perse. My sweete and best beloued. Erast. My sweete and best beloued: Perse. For thee my deare Erastus haue I liued. Erast. And I for thee, or els I had not liued. Soli. What words in affection doo I see? Erast. Ah pardon me great Soliman, for this is she, For whom I mourned more then for all Rhodes, And from whose absence I deriued my sorrow. Perse. And pardon me my Lord, for this is he, For whom I thwarted Solimans intreats, And for whose exile I lamented thus. Erast. Euen from my childhood haue I tendred thee, Witnesse the heauens of my vnfeined loue. Soli. By this one accedent I well perceiue, That heauens and heauenly powers do manage loue, I loue them both, I know not which the better, They loue each other best, what then should follow, But that I conquer both by my deserts, And ioyne their hands, whose hearts are knit already, Erastus and Perseda come you hether, And both giue me your hands, Erastus, none but thou couldst win Perseda, Perseda, none but thou couldst win Erastus From great Soliman, so well I loue you both: And now to turne late promises to good effect, Be thou Erastus Gouernour of Rhodes, By this thou shalt dismisse my garison. Brus. Must he reape that for which I tooke the toile? Come enuie then and sit in friendships seate, How can I loue him that inioyes my right. Soli. Giue me a crowne, to crowne the bride withall, Then he crownes Perseda. Perseda, for my sake weare this crowne: Now is she fairer then she was before, This title so augments her beautie as the fire, That lay with honours hand rackt vp in ashes, Reuies againe to flames, the force is such, Remooue the cause, and then the effect will die, They must depart, or I shall not be quiet, Erastus and Perseda, meruaile not, That all in hast I wish you to depart, There is an vrgent cause, but priuie to my selfe, Commaund my shipping for to waft you ouer. Era. My gratious Lord, wh? Erastus doth forget this fauor, Then let him liue abandond and forlorne. Perse. Nor will Perseda slacke euen in her praiers And still solicite God for Soliman, Whose minde hath proued so good and gratious. Soli. Farewell Erastus, Perseda farewell to. Exeunt. Me thinks I should not part with two such friends, The one so renownd for armes and curtesie, The other so adornd with grace and modestie: Yet of the two Perseda mooues me most, I and so mooues me, that I now repent, That ere I gaue away my hearts desire, What was it but abuse of Fortunes gift, And therefore Fortune now will be reuengde. What was it but abuse of loues commaund, And therefore mightie Loue will be reuengd: What was it but abuse of heauens that gaue her me, And therefore angrie heauens will be reuengd: Heauens, Loue, and Fortune, all three haue decreed, That I shall loue her still, and lack her still, Like euer thirsting wretched Tantalus: Foolish Soliman, why did I striue, To do him kindnes, and vndoe my selfe? Well gouernd friends do first regard themselues. Bru. I now occasion serues to stumble him, That thrust his sickle in my haruest corne, Pleaseth your Maiestie to heare Brusor speake. Soli. To one past cure, good counsell comes too late, Yet say thy minde. Bru. With secret letters woe her, and with gifts, Soli. My lines and gifts will but returne my shame. Luci. Here me my Lord, let me go ouer to Rhodes, That I may plead in your affections cause, One woman may do much to win another. Soli. Indeede Lucina were her husband from her, She happely might be woone by thy perswades, But whilst he liues there is no hope in her. Bru. Why liues he then to greeue great Soliman, This onely remaines, that you consider, In two extreames the least is to be chosen, If so your life depend vpon her loue, And that her loue depends vpon his life, Is it not better that Erastus die Ten thousand deaths, then Soliman should perish? Soli. I saist thou so? why then it shall be so, But by what meanes shall poore Erastus die? Bru. This shall be the meanes, Ile fetch him backe againe, Vnder couler of great consequence, No sooner shall he land vpon our shore, But witnes shall be ready to accuse him, Of treason doone against your mightines, And then he shall be doomd by marshall law, Soli. Oh fine deuise, Brusor get thee gone, Come thou againe, but let the lady stay, To win Perseda to my will, meane while, Will I prepare the iudge and witnesses, And if this take effect, thou shalt be Viceroy, And faire Lucina Queene of Tripolie, Brusor be gone, for till thou come I languish. Exeunt Brusor and Lucina. And now to ease my troubled thoughts at last, I will go sit among my learned Euenukes, And here them play, and see my minions dance, For till that Brusor bring me my desire, I may asswage, but neuer quench loues fire. Exit. Enter Basilisco. Basi. Since the expugnation of the Rhodian Ile, Me thinkes a thousand yeares are ouerpast, More for the lack of my Persedas presence, Then for the losse of Rhodes that paltry Ile, Or for my friends that there were murthered, My valour euery where shall purchase friends, And where a man liues well, there is his countrie. Alas the Christians are but very shallow, In giuing iudgement of a man at armes, A man of my desert and excellence. The Turkes whom they account for barbarous, Hauing forehard of Basiliscoes worth, A number vnder prop me with their shoulders, And in procession bare me to the Church, As I had beene a second Mahomet, I fearing they would adore me for a God, Wisely informd them that I was but man, Although in time perhaps I might aspire, To purchase Godhead, as did Hercules, I meane by doing wonders in the world: Amidst their Church they bound me to a piller, And to make triall of my valiancie, They lopt a collop of my tendrest member. But thinke you Basilisco squicht for that, Euen as a Cowe for tickling in the horne, That doone, they set me on a milke white Asse, Compassing me with goodly ceremonies, That day me thought, I sat in Pompeyes Chaire, And viewd the Capitoll, and was Romes greatest glorie. Enter Piston. Pist. I would my maister had left Some other to be his agent here: Faith I am wearie of the office alreadie, What Seigniour Tremomundo, That rid a pilgrimage to beg cakebread. Bas. O take me not vnprouided, let me fetch my weapons. Pist. Why I meant nothing but a Basolus Manus. Basi. No, didst thou not meane to giue me the priuie stab? Pist. No by my troth sir. Bas. Nay if thou hadst, I had not feard thee I, I tell thee my skin holds out Pistoll proofe. Pist. Pistoll proofe? ile trie if it will hold out pin prooue, Then he pricks him with a pin. Bas. O shoote no more great God I yeeld to thee. Pist. I see his skin is but pistol profe from the girdle vpward What suddaine agonie was that? Ba. VVhy sawst thou not, how Cupid God of loue, Not daring looke me in the marshall face, Came like a coward stealing after me, And with his pointed dart prickt my posteriors. Pist. Then here my opinion concerning that point, The Ladies of Rhodes hearing that you haue lost, A capitoll part of your Lady ware, Haue made their petition to Cupid, To plague you aboue all other, As one preiuditiall to their muliebritie, Now sir, Cupid seeing you alreadie hurt before, Thinkes it a greater punishment to hurt you behind, Therfore I would wish you to haue an eye to the back dore Bas. Sooth thou saiest, I must be fencd behinde, Ile hang my target there. Pist. Indeede that will serue to beare of some blowes, VVhen you run away in a fraye. Bas. Sirra, sirra, what art thou? That thus incrochest vpon my familiaritie, VVithout speciall admittance. Pist. VVhy do you not know me? I am Erastus man. Bas. VVhat art thou that pettie pigmie, That chalneged me at Rhodes: VVhom I refusd to combat for his minoritie, Where is Erastus I owe him chastisment in Persedas quarrel. Pist. Do not you know that they are all friends, And Erastus maryed to Perseda, And Erastus made gouernour of Rhodes, And I left heere to be their agent? Bas. O cÅlum, O terra, O maria Neptune, Did I turne Turke to follow her so far, Pist. The more shame for you. Bas. And is she linkt in liking with my foe? Pist. Thats because you were out of the way. Bas. O wicked Turque for to steale her hence. Pist. O wicked turne coate that would haue her staye. Bas. The trueth is, ile be a Turke no more. Pist. And I feare thou wilt neuer prooue good christian. Bas. I will after to take reuenge. Pist. And ile stay heere about my maisters busines. Bas. Farewell Constantinople, I will to Rhodes. Exit. Pist. Farewell counterfeit foole, God send him good shipping: Tis noisd about, that Brusor is sent, To fetch my maister backe againe, I cannot be well till I heare the rest of the newes, Therefore Ile about it straight. Exit. Enter Chorus. Loue. Now Fortune what hast thou done in this latter act? Fort. I brought Perseda to the presence, Of Soliman the Turkish Emperour, And gaue Lucina into Brusors hands. Loue. And first I stunge them with consenting loue, And made great Soliman sweete beauties thrall, Humble himselfe at faire Persedas feete, And made him praise loue and captiues beautie: Againe, I made him to recall his passions, And giue Perseda to Erastus hands, And after make repentance of the deed. For. Meane time I fild Erastus sailes with winde, And brought him home vnto his natiue land. Death. And I subornd Brusor with enuious rage, To counsell Soliman to slay his friend, Brusor is sent to fetch him back againe, Marke well what followes, for the historie Prooues me cheefe actor in this tragedie. Exeunt. Enter Erastus and Perseda. Erast. Perseda, these dayes are our dayes of ioy. What could I more desire then thee to wife, And that I haue: or then to gouerne Rhodes, And that I doe, thankes to great Soliman. Perse. And thankes to gratious heauens, that so Brought Soliman from worse to better, For though I neuer tould it thee till now, His heart was purposd once to do thee wrong. Erast. I that was before he knew thee to be mine, But now Perseda, lets forget ould greefes, And let our studies wholie be imploid, To worke each others blisse and hearts delight. Per. Our present ioyes will be so much the greater, When as we call to minde forepassed greefes, So singes the Mariner vpon the shore, When he hath past the dangerous time of stormes: But if my Loue will haue olde greefes forgot, They shall lie buried in Persedas brest. Enter Brusor and Lucina. Erast. Welcome Lord Brusor. Perse. And Lucina to. Bru. Thankes Lord gouernour. Luci. And thankes to you Madame. Erast. What hastie news brings you so soone to Rhodes? Although to me you neuer come to soone. Bru. So it is my Lord, that vpon great affaires, Importuning health and wealth of Soliman, His highnes by me intreateth you, As euer you respect his future loue, Or haue regard vnto his curtesie, To come your selfe in person and visit him, Without inquirie what should be the cause. Erast. VVere there no ships to crosse the Seas withall, My armes should frame mine oares to crosse the seas, And should the seas turne tide to force me backe. Desire should frame me winges to flie to him, I go Perseda thou must giue me leaue. Perse. Though loth, yet Solimans command preuailes, Luci. And sweete Perseda I will stay with you, From Brusor my beloued, and Ile want him, Till he bring backe Erastus vnto you. Erast. Lord Brusor come tis time that we were gon. Bru. Perseda farewell, be not angrie, For that I carry thy beloued from thee, VVe will returne with all speede possible, And thou Lucina, vse Perseda so, That for my carrying of Erastus hence, She curse me not, and so farewell to both. Per. Come Lucina lets in, my heart is full. Exeunt. Enter Soliman, Lord marshall, the two witnesses, and Ianisaries. Soli. Lord marshall, see you handle it cunningly, And when Erastus comes our periurd friend, See he be condemnd by marshall law, Heere will I stand to see and not be seene. Marshall. Come fellowes see when this matter comes in question, You stagger not: and Ianisaries, See that your strangling cordes be readie. Soli. Ah that Perseda were not halfe so faire, Or that Soliman were not so fond, Or that Perseda had some other loue, Whose death might saue my poore Erastus life, Enter Brusor, and Erastus. See where he comes, whome though I deerely loue, Yet must his bloud be spilt for my behoofe, Such is the force of morrow burning loue. Marshall. Erastus, Lord Gouernour of Rhodes, I arrest you in the Kings name. Erast. What thinks Lord Brusor of this strange arrest, Hast thou intrapt me to this tretcherie: Intended well I wot without the leaue Or licence of my Lord great Soliman. Bru. Why then appeale to him, where thou shalt know And be assured that I betray thee not. Soli. Yes, thou, and I, and all of vs betray him. Mar. No, no, in this case no appeale shall serue. Era. Why then to thee, or vnto any else, I heere protest by heauens vnto you all, That neuer was there man more true or iust, Or in his deeds more loyall and vpright, Or more louing, or more innocent, Than I haue bene to gratious Soliman, Since first I set my feet on Turkish land. Soli. My selfe would be his witnesse if I durst, But bright Persedaes beautie stops my tongue. Mar. Why sirs, why face to face expresse you not, The treasons you reueald to Soliman? Witnesses. That very day Erastus went from hence, He sent for me in to his Cabinet, And for that man that is of my profession. Eras. I neuer saw them I vntill this day. Witnesse. His Cabine dore fast shut, he first began To question vs of all sorts of fire-workes, Wherein, when we had fully resolued him, VVhat might be done, he spredding on the boord, A huge heape of our imperiall coyne, All this is yours quoth he, if you consent, To leaue great Soliman and serue in Rhodes. Mar. Why that was treason, but onwards with the rest. Enter Piston. Pist. What haue we heer, my maister before the marshall? Witn. We said not I, nor durst we say him nay, Bicause we were already in his gallyes, But seemd content to flie with him to Rhodes, With that he purst the gould, and gaue it vs. The rest I dare not speake it is so bad. Erast. Heauens heer you this, and drops not vengeance on them The other wit. The rest, and worst, will I discourse in briefe, Will you consent quoth he to fire the fleete, That lies hard by vs heere in Bosphoron, For be it spoke in secret heere quoth he, Rhodes must no longer beare the turkish yoake, We said the taske might easilie be performd, But that we lackt such drugs to mixe with powder, As were not in his gallyes to be got, At this he lept for ioy, swearing and promising, That our reward should be redoubled: We came aland not minding for to returne, And as our duty and aleageance bound vs, We made all knowne vnto great Soliman, But ere we could summon him a land, His ships were past a kenning from the shore, Belike he thought we had bewrayd his treasons. Marsh. That all is true that heere you haue declard, Both lay your hands vpon the Alcaron. 1. Wit. Foule death betide me if I sweare not true, 2. Wit. And mischiefe light on me, if I sweare false. Soli. Mischiefe and death shall light vpon you both. Mar. Erastus thou seest what witnes hath produced against thee, What answerest thou vnto their accusations? Erast. That these are Synons and my selfe poore Troy. Mar. Now it resteth, I appoint thy death, Wherein thou shalt confesse ile fauour thee, For that thou wert beloued of Soliman, Thou shalt foorthwith be bound vnto that post, And strangled as our Turkish order is. Pist. Such fauour send all Turkes I pray God. Erast. I see this traine was plotted ere I came, What bootes complaining wheres no remedy: Yet giue me leaue before my life shall end, To moane Perseda, and accuse my friend. Soli. O vniust Soliman, O wicked time, Where filthie lust must murther honest loue. Marsh. Dispatch, for our time limited is past. Erast. Alas, how can he but be short, whose tongue Is fast tide with galling sorrow. Farewell Perseda, no more but that for her: Inconstant Soliman, no more but that for him, Vnfortunate Erastus, no more but that for me: Loe this is al &amp; thus I leaue to speake. Then they strangle him Pist. Marie sir this is a faire warning for me to get me gon. Exit Piston. Soli. O saue his life, if it be possible, I will not loose him for my kingdomes worth, Ah poore Erastus art thou dead already, What bould presumer durst be so resolued, For to bereaue Erastus life from him, Whose life to me was dearer then mine owne, VVast thou and thou, Lord marshall bring them hether, And at Erastus hand let them receiue, The stroake of death, whom they haue spoild of life: VVhat is thy hand to weake? then mine shall helpe, To send them downe to euerlasting night, To waite vpon thee through eternall shade, Thy soule shall not go mourning hence alone: Thus die and thus, for thus you murtherd him, Then he kils the two Ianisaries, that kild Erastus. But soft me thinkes he is not satisfied, The breath doth murmure softly from his lips, And bids me kill those bloudie witnesses, By whose treacherie Erastus dyed: Lord Marshall, hale them to the towers top, And throw them headlong downe into the valley, So let their treasons with their liues haue end. 1. Witn. Your selfe procured vs. 2. Witn. Is this our hier? Then the marshall beares them to the tower top. Soli. Speake not a word, least in my wrathfull furie, I doome you to ten thousand direfull torments: And Brusor see Erastus be interd, VVith honor in a kingly sepulcher, VVhy when Lord marshall? great Hectors sonne, Although his age did plead for innocence: VVas sooner tumbled from the fatall tower. Then are those periurde wicked witnesses. Then they are both tumbled downe. VVhy now Erastus Ghost is satisfied: I, but yet the wicked Iudge suruiues, By whome Erastus was condemnd to die, Brusor, as thou louest me stab in the marshall, Least he detect vs vnto the world, By making knowne our bloudy practises, And then will thou and I hoist saile to Rhodes, VVhere thy Lucina and my Perseda liues. Bru. I wil my lord: lord Marshal, it is his highnes pleasure That you commend him to Erastus soule. Then he kils the Marshall. Soli. Heere ends my deere Erastus tragedie, And now begins my pleasant Comedie, But if Perseda vnderstand these newes, Our seane will prooue but tragicomicall. Bru. Feare not my Lord, Lucina plaies her part, And wooes apace in Solimans behalfe. Soli. Then Brusor come, and with some few men, Lets saile to Rhodes with all conuenient speede, For till I fould Perseda in mine armes, My troubled eares are deft with loues alarmes. Exeunt. Enter Perseda, Lucina, and Basilisco. Perse. Now signior Basilisco, which like you, The Turkish or our nation best. Basi. That which your ladiship will haue me like, Luci. I am deceiued but you were circumcised, Bas. Indeed I was a little cut in the porpuse. Per. VVhat meanes made you to steale back to Rhodes. Basi. The mightie pinckanied brand bearing God, To whom I am so long true seruitour, When he espyde my weeping flouds of teares, For your depart, he bad me follow him: I followed him, he with his fier brand, Parted the seas, and we came ouer drieshod. Luci. A matter not vnlikely: but how chance, Your turkish bonet is not on your head? Basi. Because I now am Christian againe, And that by naturall meanes, for as The old Cannon saies verie pretily, Nihill est tam naturali, quod eo modo colligatum est. And so foorth: so I became a Turke to follow her, To follow her, am now returnd a Christian. Enter Piston. Pist. O Lady and mistris, weepe and lament, And wring your hands, for my Maister Is condemnd and executed. Luci. Be patient sweete Perseda, the foole but iests, Perse: Ah no, my nightly dreames foretould me this, Which foolish woman fondly I neglected, But say what death dyed my poore Erastus? Pist. Nay, God be praisd, his death was reasonable, He was but strangled, Perse. But strangled, ah double death to me, But say, wherefore was he condemnd to die? Pist. For nothing but hie treason. Perse. What treason, or by whom was he condemnd? Pist. Faith two great knights of the post, swore vpon the Alcaron, that he would haue firde the Turkes Fleete. Perse. VVas Brusor by? Piston. I. Per. And Soliman? Pist. No but I saw where he stood, To heere and see the matter well conuaid. Perse. Accursed Soliman, prophane Alcaron, Lucina, came thy husband to this end? To lead a Lambe vnto the slaughterhouse, Hast thou for this, in Solimans behalfe? With cunning words tempted my chastitie, Thou shalt abie for both your trecheries, It must be so, Basilisco dooest thou loue me, speake, Basi. I more then I loue either life or soule, VVhat shall I stab the Emperout for thy sake. Perse. No, but Lucina if thou louest me, kill her, Then Basilisco takes a Dagger &amp; feeles vpon the point of it. Basi. The point will marre her skin. Perse. What darest thou not, giue me the dagger then, Theres a reward for all thy treasons past, Then Perseda kils Lucina. Basi. Yet dare I beare her hence, to do thee good: Perse. No let her lie, a pray to rauening birds: Nor shall her death alone suffice for his, Rhodes now shall be no longer Solimans, VVeele fortifie our walles, and keepe the towne, In spight of proud insulting Soliman, I know the letcher hopes to haue my loue, And first Perseda, shall with this hand die, Then yeeld to him and liue in infamie. Exeunt. Manet Basilisco. Basi. I will ruminate. Death which the poets Faine to be pale and meager; Hath depriued Erastus trunke from breathing vitalitie, A braue Cauelere, but my aprooued foeman: Let me see: where is that Alcides, surnamed Hercules? The onely Club man of his time: dead. VVhere is the eldest sonne of Pryam? That abraham couloured Troion: dead. VVhere is the leader of the Mirmidons, That well knit Accill: dead. VVhere is that furious Aiax, the sonne of Telamon, Or that fraudfull squire of Ithaca, I clipt Vlisses? dead, VVhere is tipsie Alexander, that great cup conquerour, Or Pompey that braue warriour? dead: I am my selfe strong, but I confesse death to be stronger, I am valiant, but mortall, I am adorned with natures gifs, A giddie goddesse, that now giueth and anon taketh, I am wise, but quiddits will not answer death: To conclude in a word, to be captious vertuous, ingenious, Or to be nothing when it pleaseth death to be enuious. The great Turque, whose seat is Constantinople, Hath beleagred Rhodes, whose chieftaine is a woman. I could take the rule vpon me, But the shrub is safe when the Cedar shaketh: I loue Perseda as one worthie, But I loue Basilisco as one I hould more worthie. My fathers sonne, my mothers solace, my proper selfe. Faith he can doe little that cannot speake, And he can doe lesse that cannot runne away. Then sith mans life is as a glasse, and a phillip may cracke it, Mine is no more and a bullet may pearce it: Therefore I will play least in sight. Exit. Enter Soliman, Brusor, with Janisaries. Soli. The gates are shut, which prooues that Rhodes reuolts, And that Perseda is not Solimans. Ah Brusor see where thy Lucina lies Butcherd dispightfullie without the walles. Bru. Vnkinde Perseda, couldst thou vse her so? And yet we vs'd Perseda little better. Soli. Nay gentle Brusor stay thy teares a while, Least with thy woes thou spoile my commedie, And all to soone be turnd to Tragedies. Go Brusor, beare her to thy priuate tent, Where we at leasure will lament her death, And with our teares be waile her obsequies: For yet Perseda liues for Soliman. Drum sound a parle, were it not for her, I would sacke the towne ere I would sound a parle. The Drum soundes a parle. Perseda comes vpon the walles in mans apparell Basilisco and Piston vpon the walles. Per. At whose intreatie is this parle sounded? Soli. At our intreaty, therefore yeeld the towne. Per. Why what art thou that boldly bids vs yeeld? Soli. Great Soliman, Lord of all the world. Per. Thou art not Lord of all, Rhodes is not thine. Soli. It was, and shall be maugre who saies no. Per. I that say no will neuer see it thine. Soli. Why what art thou that dares resist my force? Per. A Gentleman and thy mortall enemie, And one that dares thee to the single combate: Soli. First tell me, dooth Perseda liue or no? Per. She liues to see the wrack of Soliman, Soli. Then ile combate thee what ere thou art. Per. And in Erastus name ile combat thee, And heere I promise thee on my Christian faith, Then will I yeeld Perseda to thy hands. That if thy strength shall ouermatch my right, To vse, as to thy liking shall seeme best, But ere I come to enter single fight, First let my tongue vtter my hearts despight, And thus my tale begins: thou wicked tirant, Thou murtherer, accursed homicide, For whome hell gapes, and all the vgly feends Do waite for to receiue thee in their iawes: Ah periur'd and inhumaine Soliman, How could thy heart harbour a wicked thought? Against the spotlesse life of poore Erastus? VVas he not true? would thou hadst been as iust, VVas he not valiant? would thou hadst bin as vertuous, VVas he not loyall? would thou hadst beene as louing: Ah wicked tirant in that one mans death, Thou hast betrayde the flower of Christendome, Dyed he because his worth obscured thine, In slaughtering him thy vertues are defamed, Didst thou misdoe him, in hope to win Perseda, Ah foolish man, therein thou art deceiued, For though she liue, yet will she neare liue thine, VVhich to approoue, ile come to combat thee. Soli. Iniurious foule mouthd knight, my wrathfull arme Shall chastise and rebuke these iniuries. Then Perseda comes downe to Soliman, and Basilisco and Piston. Pist. I but heere you, are you so foolish to fight with him? Bas. I sirra, why not, as long as I stand by? Soli. Ile not defend Erastus innocence, But thee, maintianing of Persedas beautie, Then they fight, Soliman kils Perseda. Per. I now I lay Perseda at thy feete, But with thy hand first wounded to the death, Now shall the world report that Soliman, Slew Erastus in hope to win Perseda, And murtherd her for louing of hir husband. Soli. What my Perseda, ah what haue I doone, Yet kisse me gentle loue before thou die. Perse. A kisse I graunt thee, though I hate thee deadly. Soli. I loued thee deerelie and accept thy kisse, VVhy didst thou loue Erastus more then me, Or why didst not giue Soliman a kisse Ere this vnhappie time, then hadst thou liued: Basi. Ah let me kisse thee too before I die, Then Soliman kils Basilisco. Soli. Nay die thou shalt for thy presumption, For kissing her whom J do hould so deare, Pist. I will not kisse hir sir, but giue me leaue To weepe ouer hir, for while she liued, Shee loued me deerely, and I loued hir. Soli. Jf thou didst loue hir villaine as thou saidst, Then wait on her thorough eternall night. Then Soliman kils Piston. Ah Perseda, how shall I mourne for thee? Faire springing rose, ill pluckt before thy time. Ah heauens that hitherto haue smilde on me, Why doe you vnkindly lowre on Soliman? The losse of halfe my Realmes, nay crownes decay, Could not haue prickt so neere vnto my heart, As doth the losse of my Persedaes life: And with her life, I likewise loose my loue, And with her loue my hearts felicitie, Euen for Erastus death, the heauens haue plagued me. Ah no the heauens did neuer more accurse me, Then when they made me Butcher of my loue, Yet iustly how can I condemne my selfe, When Brusor liues that was the cause of all. Come Brusor, helpe to lift her bodie vp, Is she not faire? Bru. Euen in the houre of death. Soli. Was she not constant? Bru. As firme as are the poles whereon heauen lies. Soli. VVas she not chast? Bru. As is Pandora or Dianaes thoughts. Soli. Then tell me? his treasons set aside, VVhat was Erastus in thy opinion? Bru. Faire spoken, wise, curteous, and liberall: Kinde, euen to his foes, gentle and affable, And all, in all, his deeds heroyacall. Soli. Ah, was he so? how durst thou then vngratious Counseller, First cause me murther such a worthy man, And after tempt so vertuous a woman, Be this therefore the last that ere thou speake: Ianisaries, take him straight vnto the block, Off with his head, and suffer him not to speake. Exit Brusor. And now Perseda heere I lay me downe, And on thy beautie still contemplate, Vntill mine eyes shall surfet by my gasing: But stay let me see what paper is this. Then he takes vp a paper, and reedes in it as followeth. Tyrant my lips were sawst with deadly poyson, To plague thy hart that is so full of poison. What am I poisoned? then Ianisaries, Let me see Rhodes recouerd ere I die, Souldiers, assault the towne on euery side, Spoile all, kill all, let none escape your furie, Sound an alarum to the fight. Say Captaine, is Rhodes recouered againe. Capt. It is my Lord, and stoopes to Soliman. Soli. Yet that alayes the furie of my paine, Before I die, for doubtlesse die I must, I fates, iniurious fates, haue so decreed, For now I feele the poyson gins to worke, And I am weake euen to the very death, Yet some thing more contentedly I die, For that my death was wrought by her deuise, Who liuing was my ioy, whose death my woe. Ah Ianisaries now dyes your Emperour, Before his age hath seene his mellowed yeares, And if you euer loued your Emperour, Affright me not with sorrowes and laments, And when my soule from body shall depart, Trouble me not but let me passe in peace, And in your silence let your loue be showne: My last request for I commaund no more, Is that my body, with Persedas be, Interd, where my Erastus lyes intombd, And let one Epitaph containe vs all: Ah now I feele the paper tould me true, The poison is disperst through euery vaine, And boiles like Etna in my frying guts, Forgiue me deere Erastus my vnkindnes: I haue reuengd thy deaths with many deaths, And sweete Perseda flie not Soliman, When as my gliding ghost shall follow thee, With eager moode, thorow eternall night: And now pale Death sits on my panting soule, And with reuenging ire dooth tyrannise: And saies for Solimans too much amisse, This day shall be the peryod of my blisse. Exeunt. Then Soliman dyes, and they carry him forth with silence. Enter Chorus. Fortune. I gaue Erastus woe and miserie, Amidst his greatest ioy and iollitie. Loue. But I that haue power in earth aud heauen aboue, Stung them both with neuer failing loue. Death. But I bereft them both of loue and life. Loue. Of life, but not of loue, for euen in death, Their soules are knit, though bodies be disioynd, Thou didst but wound their flesh, their minds are free, Their bodies buried, yet they honour me. Death. Hence foolish Fortune, and thou wanton Loue, Your deedes are trifles, mine of consequence, Fortune. I giue worlds happines, and woes increase. Loue. By ioyning persons, I increase the world. Death. By wastning all, I conquer all the world, And now to end our difference at last, In this last act, note but the deedes of death, VVhere is Erastus now but in my triumph? VVhere are the murtherers but in my triumph? VVheres iudge and witnesse but in my triumph? Wheres falce Lucina but in my triumph? Wheres faire Perseda but in my triumph? VVheres Basilisco but in my triumph? VVheres faithfull Piston but in my triumph? VVheres valiant Brusor but in my triumph? And wheres great Soliman but in my triumph? Their loues and fortunes ended with their liues, And they must wait vpon the Carre of death: Packe Loue and Fortune, play in Commedies, For powerfull death best fitteth Tragedies. Loue. I go, yet Loue shall neuer yeeld to Death. Exit Loue. Death. But Fortune shall, for when I waste the world, Then times and kingdomes Fortunes shall decay. For. Meane time will Fortune gouerne as she may. Exit Fortune. Death. I now will Death in his most haughtie pride, Fetch his imperiall Carre from deepest hell, And ride in triumph through the wicked world, Sparing none but sacred Cynthias friend, Whome Death did feare before her life began, For holy fates haue grauen it in their tables, That Death shall die if he attempt her end, VVhose life is heauens delight and Cynthias friend.
