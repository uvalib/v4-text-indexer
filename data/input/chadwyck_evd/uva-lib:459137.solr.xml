      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Worshipfull Sir Arthur Mannering Knight, (Sonne and Heyre vnto Sir George Mannering of Eithfield in the Countie of Salop) Caruer vnto Prince Henry his Grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ad Lectores. In stead of Prologue to my Play, Obserue this one thing I shall say. I vse no Sceane suppos'd as many doe, But make the Truth my Sceane, and Actors too. For Of Romes great Tyrant I the storie tell, And what vnto that State in Neroes Raigne befel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter mourners to the funerall: first Cocceius Nerua, with other Flaminij: next, the hearse of Augustus: then Tiberius, with Iulia on his right hand: then Drusus Tiberius, and Liuia: Then Agripina alone: next, her three sonnes, Drusus, Nero, and Caligula: next two Consuls, Asinius Gallus, and Titius Sabinus, with other Senators. They passe ouer the stage and goe in: then sound to the Coronation: and enter first two Consuls; then Tiberius Nero, Nerua with the crowne Emperiall: then Asinius, Sabinus, and Seianus, Senators: then Drusus Tiberius, Drusus, Nero, and Caligula: Tiberius Nero ascendeth. Tib. Victorious Consuls, and graue Senators, My noble kinsmen and deere Countrim?, Deare friends to deare Augustus happinesse: Happie to haue such friends, and Countrimen: Could I but shadow out in maske of words, The sorrowing language of my groaning soule, Or with a streame of teares alay the flame, Wherewith my heart doth like an Ãtna burne, Yea Gods I call to witnesse of my thoughts, My tongue should speake, and speake in weeping words: Mine eyes should well out words, &amp; speak in teares, Wordes in my weeping, weeping in my words, To sympathize my deare affection, But since,â He feigneth to swound. Seia. What ayles my Lord? how fares your noble grace? Neru. See how the inundation of his grief Doth stop the fountaine of his vtterance. Asin. So true a griefe exprest with such true loue, Would make a man to be in loue with griefe. Dru. Tibe. My Lord and father, what deepe passion Your deep-engrauen sorrowes hath surpriz'd? Tib. Ah Drusus, Drusus, the late memorie, Of great Augustus honorable deedes, Compared with this new priuation, Doth riue my heart twixt contrarities. Now would my tongue remember his faire deedes, But then my heart swels with remembrance. Sweet Drusus, thou whose young experience, Hath not such deepe impression of these woes, Our honorable buryall rights vnfould, As moste befits these solomne Exequies. Dru. Tib. My Lord my duetie bindes me to obey, Against my reason, and my budding yeares, Yet for to checke my yeares, my reason saies, My duetie must be reason to my yeares. Therefore great States of this sad Parliament, Fathers of Rome partakers of our woes, Vouchsafe to wash your siluer haires more white, With flowing teares of true compassion. Augustus CÃ¦sar, high Octauius, The true successor of great Iulius, Who whilome glittering in his Sunne-bright raies Surpast the glorie of yong Phaeton: Now in the darke eclipsing of his daies, Lies lower then Apolloes breathlesse Sonne. Often hath Rome seene mans fragillitie, But nere before the Gods mortallitie. Ile pleade his Iustice, loe his mercie shines: Ile call him mercifull, yet iust withall: In mercy iust, in Iustice mercifull: Ile pleade his honour, then his meekenes calls, Ile praise his meekenes, yet in honours robes: In honour meeke, in meekenes honourable, Ile plead his wisdome, but his wit me checks, Ile praise his wit, yet linckt in wisdomes chaine, In wittie wisdome, and in wisdome wit. Ile plead his beautie, but his strength bids stay, Ile praise his strength but in a beautious mansion, Beauteous in valour, and in beautie strong: So if ye reake not mans fragilitie, Yet weepe to see the Gods mortalitie. Con. 1. No more sweet Drusus, into pleasing tearms A storie to displeasing thou relat'st. Con. 2. Good Drusus, adde not water to the sea, To make our sea of sorrowes ouerflow. Nerua. In vaine, in vaine, these puling signes of griefe, Effeminate waywardnes, inconstant mindes, Vassailes to fortune, slaues to natures course; Augustus dead and so must all men die, So worke the sisters of necessitie. No person humane can eternall be, But in succession hath eternitie. Since then the'ternall prouidence of heauen, Hath ratified Augustus Deitie, We must prouide for his poore Widdow left, Left to our patronage (the Common-wealth) And you my Lord Tiberius the true heire Of great Augustus by adoption, With loyall homage and true fealtie, We doe create our gratious Emperour. Tiber. And must my silence breake or heart disolue In the accepting of a double yoake? Not so Cocceius tis impossible Poore soule for me or for my modestie. To sway th'imperiall Scepter of the world, That of this world am not my Emperour, One onely PhÅnix in Arabia Presents a sacrifice to heauens eye, One onely Atlas by his prouidence The glittering starrs of heauen can support. One onely, one Augustus, onely he Our Romane PhÅnix fit for Emperie, Who I? no, no, I know not what you meane, An Emperour must wake, I drowsie am: An Emperour must be valiant, I am old: He must be iust, I may be ouer-rul'd: Sole Monarch must he be, my mother liues: And must, and shall be honoured while she liues. An Emperour must be able to endure, (In war) the winters frosts, and summers heate, I feele a palsie rooted in my bones. He must haue honie-dropping eloquence: I for my part nere playd the Orator. By this my Tribunes power well I know, How many doubtfull cares he must endure That taketh care to be an Emperour. An Empire (Gods forfend) a goodly bait, To fish for witlesse high aspiring fooles. Humilitie perswades me to auoyde A droppe of honie in a flood of Gall. Lords trouble not my resolution, I dare not, can not, will not take the crowne. Seia. By Ioue most gallantly dissembled: Aside. Alas my Lord let tribute of our teares, Plead for the orphant of our countryes state. We knowâ Ti. What do ye know? I know wel what ye know Youle say the state is dolefull: so am I. The state is now an orphant, so am I, The state hath lost his head, and so haue I My deare Augustus. He faineth weeping. Sab. Why weepes Tiberius and will not cease? And will not cease the weeping of the state? Tiber. Yes, yes, Sabinus, I will help my part, There is Germanicus the hope of Roome, Nero and Drusus, and Caligula. These gallant blossomes of the goodly stemme, Cocceius, Titius, and Asinius, The spotlesse records of antiquitie. These are fit actors for our Empires stage, I for my part will act some little part, Fit for my barren witte and leaden tongue, And you my Lords share in equaltie, The glorious Sceanes of Roomes faire Emperie. Asi. Why then my Lord Tiberius, choose your part The fruitfull Sicily or gold of Spaine, The Arabian spices, or the Indian pearles, The English wels, or Vines of Italie: The Palmes of Iury, or the Sithian Bathes, Either Ãgiptian Isis, or Roomes Ioue, Memphis or Rome, Athens or Troynouant. Large Citties, fertile soile, and gratious Gods: If these, or any other may content, Within the Circuit of our Empirie, My Lord, choose out your part, and leaue the rest To be assign'd at our discretion. Seianus aside. O for a shift, now Lyon rouse thy selfe, Or else for euer loose thy Lyons head. Tib. May I Asinius choose? then this I choose, To take no charge, for all I know is care, Sicilians mutinous and Spaniards proud, Arabians simple fooles, and Indians droyles, Britons too rude, Italians too too wise, Disloyall Sirians, superstitious Iewes, Isis too far, and Ioue is plac'd too neare, Memphis, and Rome, Athens and Troynouant, All goodly Cities, but all dangerous, By Ioue my hate hee deadly shall obtaine, That bids me but to take a part againe. Assi. Not soe my Lord, you did misconster me, I did not meane to make deuision In the vnited Vnion of the Realme: I did not meane to separate the Sunne, To runne by peece-meale in the Zodiacke: Nor dreame of multiplicitie of soules, Which one continued essence animates, The heauens cannot mooue without a Sunne: Nor can the heauens haue more Sunnes then one. Tiber. Assinius I perceiue I did you wrong, So to interpret your oration, I am sorry, (troth I am) and if I liue Ile recompence your mightie iniuries. Neru. Will not Tiberius then accept the Crowne? Tiber. Why should Tiberius libertie be ceased? Neru. No, Princes haue the rule of libertie. Tiber. If libertie in greatnesse did relie. Neru. My Lord, my Lord, it is no time to iest, Nor dallie it out in quoin'd Antithesis, Emperour or no Emperour, will you the Crowne or no? Nero, speake plaine, it is high time to knowe. Tib. Take heed my Lords, be warie in your choise, Least after stormes controle your rash attempt, You are to choose but once, consider well; After, all Subiectes to your Emperour. If you constraine me to this doubtfull taske, And I (as God forbid) should change my minde, Turning my pittie to a Lyons rage, My snow white conscience to a Scarlet dye. Would not the Nations of the lesser world That are not subiect to our Emperie, Deride your lunaticke election? And if ye should but thinke amisse of me, Would they not laugh at your inconstancie? Take heede, take heede, in vaine ye will repent, Being fore-warn'd, and yet would not preuent. Sabin. My Lord, how long shall we wright in the sands, Or plough the ayre with vaine delusions? Our tongues are tyred, and our throates are hoarse, And all in vaine we bend our suplyant knees, Vassaile our idle thoughts of reuerence, Subdue our mounting fancies to your loue, And will not all this mooue Tiberius? Ne., Ger. Good Grandsire graunt the Senatours request. Dru. Ger. Grandsire, they speake in earnest, take the Crowne. Calig., Ger. Grandsire accept this golde, looke how it shines! My thinkes it would become you passing fine. Tiber. Deare Children, (old Tiberius eldest care) My heart doth daunce to heare the melody, That heauenly Consort tuned to mine eares, Thanks my kinde kins-men, noble Romains th?ks Euen from my heart, although my cares increase, Constrain'd, yet gratefull for your kinde constraint, Bound to receiue that which my soule abhors, Enforc'd to honour which my yeares deny, Inchain'd to rule, bane to my modestie. Yet were my cares in number infinite, (For who can number all his cares hath none) Should they showre downe in droppes of streaming blood Muster in troups of languishing dispaire, Swarme like to Bees, sting like to Scorpions; Or like a flocke of Vultures gnaw my heart: Yet these and more, and twice ten thousand more, Old Nero will for Countries cause indure, For you my Fathers, and for you my Sonnes. Sound Trumpets, Nerua crowneth him. Ner. Most mightie CÃ¦sar, great Tiberius, Euer Augustus Tribune of the State, Perpetuall Dictator, Lord of Rome, Sole Consull for our conquered Prouinces, Prince of the Senate in our policies, Wee heere inuest your sacred Majestie, In all the Ornaments jmperiall, Roomes and the worlds most glorious Emperour. Omnes. Long liue Tiberius Roomes great Emperor. Tiber. Like as an hartles fawne, enuironed Within the circuit of the hunters crie, So stand I (Romaines) wondring at your showtes. These new alarum's quel my slumbring thoughts, Chast to the Bay, I breathelesse panting muse, To view the vnquoth glorie of the hunt. Neuer could Sparta glorie of such pray, As for to haue an Emperour at bay. But noble Romaines, there's another Deare, A gallant Roebucke, braue Germanicus: Roomes shining Beacon in rude Germany, Our deare adopted Sonne, our blessed care, To him my Lords as zeale of my affection, And signe of duetie to the common state, We doe prorogue eight yeares Proconsulship. On you Asinius we doe impose, To be our Legate to Germanicus. Tell him we loue him, (and be sure you doe) Tell him we honour him (doe not forget) We loue and honour deare Germanicus, And would be ioyfull to beholde our Sonne, Honoured in triumph at the Capitall. But that we knowe the honour of his minde, Disdaines to crop the blossomes of his fame, Till it be flowred in his Summers pride, And all the barbarous Germaines be subdu'd. This doe Asinius and returne with loue, In our new glorie, we thy honour proue. Asini. My Lord, what ere Asinius honour proueth His expedition shall declare he loueth. Tiber. Now Fathers, we will to the Sacrifice, Saluting all the Gods in visitation: Let Lectisternia three daies be proclaimed, The Sibbels, counsels, and Flaminies, Ianus shut vp, and Vestaes fier blaze, Into the middle region of the ayre, Wee all my Lords will to the Cappitoll, In siluer seale, our records to enrole. Exeunt omnes. Enter Plebeians, foure speakers. 1 Did you not see our new Emperour how brauely he came from his Corronation? 2 Yes, twa's a gall?t sight sure, but did you mark his countenance? my thought tis mightily altred within this fiue or six quarters of a yere since I saw him last: 3 I, and I saw him goe to the Senate, and as you say, my thinks hee is much altered, and lookes more terrible a great deale. 2 I that same lookes I promise is an il signe, pray God all be well. 4 Well, wee must hope the best, and thinke tis a great change from a subiect to become a sufficient, for simple as I stand heere, if I should chaunce to bee chosen Emperour, I should assault my selfe highly I can tell you, or any of vs all. 3 Augustus was a goodly man, and I hope hee has left such a gracious sample, that Tiberius wil not forget himselfe. 1 Neuer talke of Augustus more, we shal neuer see his like in Rome, vnlesse Germanicus might bee our Emperour. Om. O worthy Germanicus! hee's a flower indeed. 1 My maisters, let's talk no more of these State-matters, for I am afraid we haue said too much already, if the Emperor should know of it. 2 You haue said wisely neigbour, for Emperors see &amp; heare all that they desire: I haue heard my father tel my mother so, they haue millions a Spirits that tels them all. 3 I care not, I saide nothing, but praide God hee might be no worse th? Augustus, that was no harme: 4 Well, let vs part vpon this that hath been said, and lets keepe one anothers counsels, and take heed heereafter. Exeunt. Enter Germanicus with Centurion Soldiers. Ger. Well followed Tribunes, gallant Gentlem?, Thus are these hearts chac'd to their lurking dens, That brayed like Asses in their Lyons skinne. Worthy Centurion, thou whose might did breake The triple ranges of our dangerous foes, Whose well way'd buckler tooke so many darts, As seem'd to cloud the sunne with multitude: Accept the honour of a Gentleman, Crown'd with the triumph of victorious spoyles, This Crowne thus pleated of the verdant grasse, Thy high vplifted head shall more adorne, Then all the honour of proud Germany. Centu. Noble Germanicus a Romaine heart, Hath by inheritance a mounting spirit, Did not great Coriolanus so aduaunce, The mellow fruite of his old withered stocke? Did not three hundeth Fabij all at once, In one day breath, war, vanquish, fight and dye, All to maintaine the honour of their name? So did Marius in Numidia, And happie Scylla vnder Scipio. With what alacritie did Sceuola, Encounter Porsenes torture, death and fire, All to maintaine the honour of their name, And should not I hazard this blaze of life, This rising bubble, this imprisoned soule, This changing matter, this inconstant act, For Countrie, friends, and honour of my name? Enter a Page. Page. My Lord, heere is a Legate sent from Rome, Which craues accesse vnto your Majestie. Ger. Let him draw neare: Cosen Assinius! Enter Asinius. Welcome my noble friend to Germaine, Asin. All happinesse vnto Germanicus, I haue a secret message to impart, If please your Grace of priuate patience. Ger. Tribunes looke to the 4. gates of the Camp: See that the trenches bee inchaneld deepe, Send out our scouts, if they can spie the Foe, Number their Cohorts and their Legions: Comfort the maimed, burie all the dead, Refresh your bodies, for to morrow morne We meane to scoure this vanquisht region: awayâ Exeunt. Now good Assinius, tell Germanicus The substance that your message doth import. Asin. Were I not now to speake vnto your Grace My tongue should play the Rethoritian, And in graue precepts striue to moralize, Or make a long discourse of patience, Adding a crooked sign'd Parenthesis, Of puling sorrow twixt each sipred line. But for Asinius, knowes your setled minde So nurst in flowing streames of constancie, Asinius doth reporte Augustus death, I will not common place of mortall men, Nor of his vertue, nor his Noblenesse, Nor Solons graue aduise shall be my Theame: I know I speake vnto Germanicus, Besides, Tiberius is our Emperour. He saith he loues you, and to shew his loue, Hath your proconsulship eight yeres prorogu'd. Enter the Centurion which was crowned. Cent. Germanicus and graue Asinius, Awake from counsell, all are in vprore, Our Germane Legions are all mutinous. And crie Germanicus our Emperour, Germanicus our noble Emperour. They make a Throne of tufts, and then they crie, Germanicus shall be our Emperour. Germ. A world of cares at once assault my soule, I am distracted, harke, the mutinies. They crie within, and exeunt omnes. Enter Tiberius, Iulia, and Seianus. Tib. Impute it not vnto vngratefulnesse, (Imperious Augusta of great Rome, And which doth touch me nearer dearest mother, That Nero hath deferd indebted thankes, Eqiualent vnto your high deserts. I can not (mother) set your praise to sale, Or Orator it with a glosing tongue, Graced with picked phrases, glorious speech, Choice Synonimies, pleasing Epithites, Paged by apish action, toying gesture, Mother I hate this tip-tongued flatterie, Better is me, be as you see me now, Thankfull in outward deeds, than outward shew, But forward mother with your former tale. Iulia. No sooner the vncontrolled fates, Exilde his life, and with his life our care, But that Seianus from whose faithfull tongue, (As from Apollos tru-sent Oracles, We chiefe deriue the drift of our affaires) Roasted like to the Palphraies of the Sunne, To Roades where thou in exile didst remaine, There to enforme thee of Augustus death, The Empires vacancie, and thy repeale. Tib. My tongue denies to blazon in harsh words Deare friends the thankfulnesse my heart affords. Iulia. Meane while had I not with great policie, Buried in silence great Augustus death, And in the closet of my care-sworne brest, Embosomed the notice of the same, Shewne vnto thee, smoothered to vulgar fame, Bar'd from the base Plebeians itching eares, A Castrell had possest thy Eagles nest. And thou the Eagle hadst beene dispossest. Seia. But now that Castrel in his course is stopt, Clipt are his pinions of ambitious flight: Nor shall he hope to sit where Nero soares. Tib. Were he the issue of eternall Ioue, Or farre more fortunate in his successe, Then was Alcides, or faire Thetis sonne, More happie in the ofspring of his loynes Then Priam in his childrens multitude, Yet would I bridle his aspiring thoughts, And curbe the reynes of his ambition. Seia. Wel can he braue it in his barbarous armes, Against th'oppugning force of Germanie, And stranger nations of the farthest North, Whose hearts like to their Climate hard congeald, Are frozen cold to Romes felicitie. A crested Burganetto more fits him, Then to ingirt his Temples with a Crowne. Tib. Therefore in policie by thine aduise, Vnder pretext of honourable minde, We deligated to Germanicus, Asinius Gallus into Germanie, With twice foure yeares prorogued Consulship. Iulia. Which of necessitie he must accept, Sith hope of higher honour is forestald. Tiber. Tis true, for what he aim'd at, I enioy: This was th'attractiue Magnes of his hopes. Seia. To which how hardly did you seeme allur'd With such denyall you refused it: Making a Commentarie on the Crowne, With oh! the duetie of an Emperour, How warie, watchfull, wise he ought to be, How drowsie, and improuident you were, With heaping vp a storie of what cares They vndergoe, that vndertake to rule, So grac'd with sundrie squemish subtilties, As Mercurie himselfe (the God of witte) Might haue admir'd, but not haue matched it. Tiber. Yet did that Argus eyed Assinius, Both marke and bluntly mate me in my drift, With, choose your part my Lord in Britany, Or heyday, where you will, so not in Rome, but by my Genius ile rememberâ Iulia. I, had not wise Asinius vttered it. Tiber. Had me no had-nots, nor Asinius Can so ore cannopie his close conceite, But I will know the Panther by his skinne. Nor am I ignorant of his great loue He beares vnto the proud Germanicus, How euer clowed in hippocresie. Seian. I, that Germanicus holds al their hearts, Iuli. No meruaile, for they call him Roomes chiefe hope Seia. And some did say he should be Emperour, In spite of Iulia and hir exild Sonne, Tiber. But neither Iulia nor her exilde Sonne, Would haue endured such competitors. Nero will brooke no riuall in his rule, Vnlesse it be th'emperious Iulia, To whome the law of nature bindes Tiberius So firme obleiged in obedience, As all the attributes of Majestie, Rome, or the world, or Nero can affoord, I deeme too meane a tribute for her loue. Whose loue first lent the essence of my life, Whose life doth onely make me loue to liue. Iulia. Enough my sonne. Sufficient presidents of dutious minde, We oft haue proued and approued oft, And for our part neuer did Hecuba Beare so great loue to all the sonnes she bare, As Iulia doth to one Tiberius. Tib. Mother, I do confesse and know it true, But in the infancie of our estate, More priuate consultation better fits, We and Seianus, will into our studie. Iulia. And we into our walking Gallerie. Exeunt. Enter Germanicus solus. Germ. I haue dispatcht Asinius to Rome, With thankes to Nero and the Senators. O Roome! Augustus dead, Tiberius Emperour, The Romaine Senate glozing flatterers, The Legions discontent and mutinous: The Pretors tyrants in their Prouinces: The Nauie spoil'd, vnrig'd, dismembred: The Cittie made a brothell house of sinne Italians valour turn'd to luxurie. The field of Mars turn'd to a Tennis-court, Mineruaes Oliue to the Mirtle tree, Appoloes Laurell, vnto Bacchus Vine, High Ioue contemd, and Vestaes Tapers scornd, The Oracles dispis'd, the Sibbils bookes Esteem'd as superstitious delusions: The Orient vp in armes and Piso fled, The Gallogretians proud for to rebell, Affricke in vprore, Asia in braules. And these rude Germaine-kernes not yet subdued. Besides a new deuis'd Religion, Of the inconstant Iewes cal'd Christians: Our sacred Oracles some are stroke dumbe, And some fortolde of Romes destruction: Vocall Boetia in deepe miseries, And Delphian glorie in obscurenesse lies, A Geminied PhÅbus, a three doubled moone, A whirling Commet, flashing in the ayre, A Wolfe ascended to the Cappitoll: The Temple blasted of fidelitie: A common Harlet to bring foorth a Beare, O Gods! my heart doth quake, my soule doth feare. Enter a Page. Page. My Lord, the scoutes discouered the wood, Wherein the Germaines doe in ambush lie. Ger. Sirra, goe tell them I will scarre the Crowes. Page. My Lord. Exit. Ger. Boy, trouble not my Meditations, What should I spend my time to scarre these crowes, When there's a cole-blacke Rauen pearcht so high? Germanicus, soare thou an higher pitch, Towre like a Larke, and like an Eagle mount, Till thou hast seaz'd vpon thy pray: for why? The Legions loue thee, hate Tiberius: Honour thy vertues, scorne his cowardise, Extoll thy meekenesse, and reuile his pride: Pray for thy happinesse and cursse his daies, My Father Caius: his was Claudius, I am of CÃ¦sar, he of Iulia: I heire by nature he but by adoption: Rome saw thee honoured, Rhodes him bannished, He tam'd the Foxes of Illiria, But I the Lyons of proud Germanie. And this were cause enough, were there no other: I by Augustus made, he by his mother. But thou art heire imperall to the state: But he that lookes for death may hope to late. Yet hope Germanicus, good hopes a treasure, But he that hopes for meate, may starue at pleasure. I, but Tiberius Nero's verie olde, But young enough to liue to see thee sold. I, but he loues thee for Augustus sake, Augustus gone, the match ts new to make, But since his death, thy power he hath augmented, I, that at Rome my power might be preuented: He sent thee word he loues thee, so I thinke: Who would not loue the wine he meanes to drinke? He honours thee (he said) and so I deeme, Who would not of the fattest Goate esteeme? Impatient furie flye Germanicus, How is thy reason dimn'd with clowdie passion? Proud swelling dropsie, euer gnawing worme, Insatiate vulture, vile ambition, Deluding Sirene, where's Germanicus? The Legions loue thee not for to aspire, Thy vertue shines not in oppression; No honour in ambitious aray: No meekenes in a traytors happines, Thy Father got thee not for to rebell, Nor CÃ¦sar did abet thy treacheries, By nature heire, then be thou naturall, Rome saw thy honour, change not liuerie, But make thy haruest vp in Germanie.

Enter Caligula at one end of the stage, and Seianus at the other end below. Iulia at one end aloft, and Tiberius Nero at the other. Cal. I am a foole, I am Caligula, Suppos'd and idiot, and am so indeed, For he that will liue safe must seeme a foole. Iulia. Am not I Empresse, and shall I be control'd. Am I Augusta, and shall I not rule? Haue I made him to raigne, and shall I stoope? Is he my sonne, and am not I his mother? Tiberius thou shalt know a womans hate, Exceedeth bounds, and neuer can haue date. Tib. How am I Emperour and my mother rule? Is she the Sunne, shall I the shadow be? I but the smoake, and shall she be the fire? I but a bare imagination, And she the image that is honoured? I but the eccho, shall she be the sound? A plague vpon her, I will her confound. Seia. Thus will I do: nay thus, nay villaine thus Poison Tiberius: I but Germanicus, The Emperour and his mother seeme to iarre. Fight Dog, fight Cat, for both your sports ile marre But Nero loues me: so did my mother to, And yet I brake her necke in honestie. Mother forgiue me, ile doe so no more, Yet if a thousand mothers necks would serue To get me to be Emperour of Rome. By heauens I would not leaue one necke aliue, And to be sure that they should all be broke, Ide hire some honest ioynter them to set, And breake them ouer twentie thousand times, And for to recompence his worthy paine, Ide make him set his owne nine times againe. Caligu. I laugh to see how I can counterfeite, And I should blush, if that Germanicus, My father, my dissembling should beholde He knowes I am a Soldier, not a foole: My mother was deliuered in the Campe, And in my swadling cloathes, I chac'd the Foe, My Cradle was a Corslet, and for milke I battened was with blood: and fed so fast That in ten yeares I was a Collonell. My mother knew this, but she deemes me chang'd Poore woman in the loath some Romish stewes, O Mother, I am chang'd: but wherefore soe? Caligula of Caligula must not knowe. Iul. Shall I call him a Bastard? true it is, But Iulia, then thou doo'st thy selfe the wrong. Say that he was Augustus murtherer, Yet therein Iulia thou wert counseller, How then? a vengeance on his cursed head, So he were murther'd would that I were dead. Vile Monster that I am, to perrish loath, Yet heauen's raine brimstone and consume vs both, I am impatient, yet I must dissemble. Exit Iulia. Tiber. She is my Mother, I must honour her: She is my Ladie, I must shew her duetie: She is most wise, worthie of reuerence: I but the hag is moste ambitious, Shee must haue Priestes forsooth, and Flaminies, To sacrifice vnto her majestie, She must checke Nero, I and schoole him too; As he were prentise to hir tutorship, She must incorporat free Denizens: Or else sheele scold and raile, &amp; snarle and bite, And take vp Nero for his lustinesse. Well, let her scolde, and rayle, and snarle and byte, Nero will mannage well the haggard kite, I will by Ioue, I will, yet I must seeme As though my mother I did most esteeme. Exit Tib. Sei. He that wil clime, and aime at honours white, Must be a wheeling turning pollititian: A changing Proteus, and a seeming all, Yet a discoloured Camelion Fram'd of an ayrie composition: As fickle and vnconstant as the ayre: Fit for the Sunne to make a Raine-bow in, By each new fangled reflection, Rul'd by the influence of each wandring starre, Waxe apt to take each new impression. With wisemen sober, with licencious, light: With proud men stately, humble with the meeke: With old men thirftie, and wit young men vaine: With angrie, furious, and with mild men calme: Humerous with one, and Cato with another: Effeminate with some, with other chaste, Drink with the Germain, with the Spaniard braue: Brag with the French, with the Ãgiptian lie, Flatter in Creet, and fawne in GrÃ¦cia. This is the way, Seianus vse thy skill, Or this, or no way must thou get thy will. If thou doost meane the Empire to obtaine, Sweare, flatter, lye, dissemble, cog, &amp; faine. Exit Se. Calig. Caligula, why doth thy slumbring soule, Thus dreame within thy common sences mansion?

Good brother calme your furious swelling rage, We gaue our voices in his election, nay Brother storme not, here me what I say, Did not we sweare loyall fidelitie, within the Capitoll vnto his grace? Did we not both at Vestaes sacred shrine, Pray for the safetie of his Majestie? And wilt thou Drusus now recall thy oath, Recall thy vowes, recall thy prayers insence? Remember Drusus, what so ere he be, Now he is crown'd al's past recouerie. Dru. Crown'd, I, and may be discrown'd for ought you know How say you mother, may it not be so? Cal. This ti's to be resolu'd my gall?t Brother. a far off. How hardly can I my affections smother? Agrip. Young Impes of honour, in you both I finde A noble way to vertuous resolution: In thee my Nero, wisdomes treasurie: In thee my Drusus, magnanimitie, In both, your fathers honorable minde. Speake faire my Sons (awhile) vnto Tiberius, Vntill the tryumph of Germanicus: Then be resolu'dâ The cause is honorable, feare no ill. But Oh my Sonnes! yonder's Caligula Capring: he takes no heede of higher thinges, Ile call him hether, and see what he saies: Caligula, come hether gentle Sonne, How doost thou like the great Tiberius? Cal. Faith hee's a braue man Mother, and his parrell is fit, and he has a fine Crowne of golde, and all this makes him but a braue m?, for what would you haue in a braue man but he may haue it? Agrip. Well, well my Sonne, youle neuer leaue your toies. Calig. Why Mother, he can turne aboue ground, turne on the toe, turne euerie way, what should I say more? By heauen a braue man. Nero. And what can you doe Brother, let vs see? Cal. Faith Brother I am not in the humour, and braue men can doe nothing without it bee in an humour. Drus. Come let vs leaue this humorous Gentlem?. Agrip. Farwell Caligula. Exeunt. Agr. Drus. &amp; Nero Caligu. I, I warrant you, for ile sup at Court to night. Farewell Mother, bretheren both farewel, Whome I admire in such deuotion: But dare not trust. Drusus I know thee well, And loue thee dearely, for thy high resolues, But dare not trust thee. Nero I applaud Thy wisdome, but it wants a resolution. Nero and Drusus, beware the braine-sicke foole Caligula, set you not both to Schoole. Exit. Enter Iulia, Tiberius, and Seianus. Iulia. Heard ye not with what general applause, Asinius was welcommed to Rome? At his returne from barbarous Germany, How many greedie eares did glut themselues, With hearing newes of their Germanicus? How many greedy tongues in labour were, To blazen foorth the trophees of his praise? Tiber. Not Priams Hector from the flying Greeks, Whome he had chased from the Terrhene shore, Return'd with greater expectation, Then laden with the spoiles of Germaine foes, The people long to see Germanicus. Seia. Not onely the Plebeians, but the Equites, Do reuerence him within their inward thoughts, as if the Vassaile were a demie God. Tiber. And rightly marry, for if Nero liue, Nero shall deifie him to the full. Seia. But if you suffer him on honors wings, To soare vp higher in ambitious flight, Borne on the tempest of the peoples tongues: Tis tenne to one, heele neuer stoope to lure, To keepe him short, is onely to be sure. Iulia. Let vs commaund him, vpon paine of death, Not to approach within our cittie walles, But either to dismisse his Soldiers, Or on the plaines pitch his Pauillions. Tiber. No marry mother, not for all the world, Why? it were omminous: Romes walles engirt, With armed garrisons of greatest foes, Vnpolitiquely counsel'd in my minde, Administring too fit occasion, For to suspect and feare a foule pretence. And further, that the base Plebeians, As wauering, and inconstant in their loues, as is thee changing Laconiades: Who hearing but a muttering of our driftes, Would like a world of riuers to the maine, Flow to Germanicus by multitudes, Whose swelling pride, by their repaire encrease, Will ouerflow the bankes of loyaltie. Mother this was but shallow pollicie, But who'st that interrups our conference? Enter Piso from Armenia. Seia. It's Lucius Piso, Pretor of Sirria. Tiber. Welcome to Rome, and olde Tiberius. What newes in Sirria, and Armenia? With all our Orientall Prouinces: Pis. Peace hath resign'd her rome to bloody warre, Whilst Mars the furie-breathing God of armes, Knits vp his fore-head in a fearefull frowne And in the furrowes of his foulded browes, Displaies the sable Ensigne of sad death, Vpon the spacious Armenian plaines, And all the orient in rebellious pride, (Threatning destruction, to our westerne world) Doe seeme to challenge vs in daring armes. Tiber. Who is the Head in this rebellion? Pis. The cheife controler of these warlicke troups Is vncontrold Vonones on whose Crest: Victorie seemes to daunce among his plumes, His Burgonet and steele Habergeon, Of bloody colour like vnto his minde, Of visage sterne, broad brow'd, and hollow ey'd, Looking as though he did comprise the world, Within the complot of some stratagem. Tiber. Ha! what, so soone Armenia vp in armes, Hast thou forgot thy wonted seruitude? Are Romanes vertues and their vigor done? Or dead with Silla that first conquered thee? Are all the stripes that strong Lucullus gaue, Vnto thy neighbour Pontus and thy selfe, Quite healed vp, without offensiue scarre? are mightie Pompeies Tropheis quite forgot? Well, be it so: they blow rebellious flame, And they shall feele the furie of the same, Meane while, returne thou Piso to thy lodging, Till fit occasion to employ thee hence. Exit. Piso Seia. How likes your Maiestie this woful newes? Iu. Like enough, he misliketh it enough. Might Iulia counsell him, he should reuenge it, with more extreamitie of punishment, Then angrie Ioue raign'd from the vault of heauen Vpon his Throne oppugning Briaris. Tibe. I, soft and faire, first stop our feares at home, Then let Armenia feele the force of Rome. Sei. Good counsaile, great Tiberius, knew we how. Tiber. How? what are all our pollicies extinct? Noe, be attentiue, and ile tell thee how, The head-spring stopt, the smaller founts will faile. and thus our home bred feare Germanici, Grounding their hopes vpon their fathers haps, Take from his life their lights continuance, His life therefore extinct, their light is done. Iul. This is the thing that we consulted off, But to no purpose yet. Tibe. Yes Mother yes, By this occasion of the Armenian wars, an opportunitie is offered vs, Both to reuenge and rid vs of our foes. This Vsurer of fame Germanicus, (Who gapes as greedily for faire renowne, As doth a niggard for a showre of golde.) No sooner shall returne to Rome, Grac'd with the tryumphes of his victories, But by my pollicie; and faire pretext, We will conclude it in the Senate house, That for the safetie of Romes tottering state, Germanicus must to Armenia, Where hee shall fall by fierce Vonones sword, Or if he scape, weele so determine it, As Ioue to Saturne, shall resigne his Throane, and banisht from the Speare, where now he raignes, Humble himselfe, below the horned Moone, Before he shall returne to visite Rome. Enter Drusus, Liuia, and Spado. Drus. Tiber: The Gods preserue your royall Maiestie Tibe. Good day vnto you Sonne and Liuia. Iulia. Haue you attended long our comming forth? Liuia: Not verie long my gracious Grandmother, But hearing you were in close conference, It had beene rudenesse to haue interrupted yee. Tiber. We were indeede in consultation, about affaires of speciall secrecie, But where fore-lookes our Sonne so sad this morne? Drus. Tiber. Hath not the clang of harsh Armenian troupes The ratling sound of Clarions &amp; Drums, Thundred into your eares a deepe reuenge? The Orient doth shine in warlike steele, and bloody streamers waued in the ayre, By their reflexions die the plaines in red, as omminous vnto distructiue wars, as are the blazing Commets in the East. Tiberi: We haue both heard, and eke consulted of The whole effect: of which our conference, We shall at fitter time relate to thee. Meane while lets make our preparation, against th'arriuall of Germanicus, Who meanes tomorrow for to Royalize, The triumphes of his Germaine victories. Exeunt Tiberius, Iulia, and Drusus Manet Seianus &amp; Liuia, &amp; Spado. Seian. Madame, a word with your good Ladiship. Liui. So please it your good Lordship, so ye may. Seian.

Yet must you know it or I must not be. Liuia. Can Liuia then impart a remedie? Seia. I, if she please to salue my maladie. Liuia. What salue should Liuia to your sore apply? Seia. Pitties quintesence, and soft clemencie. Liuia. Strange sore, strange salue. Seian. Yet not so strange as true. Liuia. I pittie it: God send you ease, adue. Seia. Yet heare me gentle Lady ere you part, To tel my paine doth somewhat ease my heart. And to be graced with attentiue heede, To Louers doth especiall comfort breede. Liuia. Then is my Lord a Louer?

Onely the inchantments of her Cristall eies, Which had they glaunced on enamoured Ioue, While Io liu'd Ioue, would haue beg'd her loue, and spite of Iuno, Hebe and Ganimede, She onely should haue grac'd Theatates bed, Liu. Pearelesse belike, and fit to be a Cowe, Farewell Seianus, I must leaue ye nowe. Seia. Deare Madam, one word more, and then farwel Liui. Be briefe Seianus then. Seia.

By these bright shining Tapers thy faire eies The guiding Planets of Seianus life, Which beautifie the heauen of thy face, With farre more glorious admiration, Then chast Dictinna or Latonaes Sonne, But one word more (deare soule) and I haue done, By this faire braunch, sprouted from fairer tree, Enamuled with Azure Riuerets, Blew coloured vaines, which euerie waies disper'st, In kinde embraces clip thy tender hand. Liui. Villaine, let goe, gripe not my hand so hard. Seia. How can I chose, sith you do gripe my heart? Liu. Let goe my hand, or I will haue thy head. I gripe thy heart villaine as thou art! Sei.

That haue ye done alreadie by your spight, And now accept this sacrifice. He swoundeth. Spa. O cruell plight! Liu.

Not lust nor loue, but hate and iniurie, Inspire me with profounder pollicie. Vnder this vale of loue iuuelloped: Tis not a kisse: an Empire tis I seeke, An opportunitie to claime the crowne, And fit occasion to wreake reuenge, Vpon her husband for his iniuries. Drusus, the boxe on the eare thou gaue'st me, Becomes the Prologue of thy Tragedie. Meane while, let this suffice: for my intent Is onely for to loue this instrument, As did Vlisses, Troyes Paladium, Not for it selfe, but Troyes destruction. But whist Seianus prison vp thy tongue, Now to the tryumphes, I haue staid to long. Enter Germanicus in Tryumph with the Arch-flamines before him, Tiberius on his right hand, Asinius and Sabinus, next Iulia, Agripina, and Liuia, then Nero, Drusus and Caligula, Germanici, then Seianus and other Senators, then the Captaines of Germanicus with his Soldiers and Prisoners, they crowne him with Crownes and Garlands according to the Custome, and all crie. Omnes. Long liue victorious Germanicus, In glory Royallize. Ner. Archfla. Noble Germanicus whose winged fame, Swift glyding through the frozen Germany, Hath brought vs newes of thy faire victories, Thou that doest equalize in honors Titles, The elder Scipio, noble Affrican, And younger Scipio Asiaticus, Paulus Emilius of proud Macedon, Flaminiaes conquest, and Metellus glorie: Old Fabius wisdome and Marcellus furie, Renowned Gracchus gallant resolution, Braue man at armes vnfold thy Victories, Which heauens themselues doe seeme to solemnize Ger. First to the Gods the Authors of my good, I sacrifice the insence of my thankes. Next vnto you my Lord imperiall, I wish eternitie of happinesse. All you that weare the snowie liuerie, Of long experience worthie Senators: And you the flowring blossomes of faire Rome, My verie essence, valiant Soldiers all Louing Quirites, loyall countriemen, Faire Ladies, mirrors of the amazed world, Embelished with royall chastitie; In all the circuite of my humble vowes, I offer vp to Ioues protection, Since first my Lords I entred Germanie, The fertile soile of base Rebellion, Our Eagles twice nine times haue been displaid, And twice nine times with Tropheis honored. The barbarous Marshes on the southerne side, Hailde downe three furious stormes of poysoned darts Not Cicas torture bloody Scithian: Nor Crassus scourge, disembling Partheans, Did euer rage in such tempestious showres, But by the prowesse of our valiant Knights, Who all alighted from their furious steedes. We stil'd the hissing of these poysonous Snakes, Which all the neighbour countrie stinges to death, Omnes. Long liue the valiant Germanicus. Ger. But on the northerne side of Germany, Whereas th'Vsipites kept the plaine, Impalled in a wildernesse of wood, Wal'd with a rockie mountaine in the East, Back't with the sea vppon the northerne Coast, Enchannel'd with a deepe intrenched meere. Betwixt our Legions on the Southerne side, These mew'd-vp Foxes in this Stratagem, Derided all our Legions braueries. Foure times with all our power we gaue assault, To winne the passage of that daungerous meere, Foure times repulsed by the quaking ground, That trembling durst not beare our Soldiers. At length when Cinthia's borrowed waining light Repai'd the essence of her brothers lampe, Behinde the low desending of the hill, I saw the Ocean farre rebattered, As when the elder African in Spaine, by ebbing Thetis scarred Carthage walles, So by the flying backward of the maine, The Foxes on the backe I saw engirt, That thankes to Neptune for his clemencie, They all adorne our royall victorie. Omnes. Long liue the valiant Germanicus. Ger. Next to th'Vsipetes were incamp't, The Tubants houering on the Mountaines side, That if our Legions approach't the hill, They roule downe rocks of stone to murther them. Vpon the hanging of the steepie Clift, There was by nature plac'd a little groue, But surely guarded for the Druides, To solemnize their humane sacrifice, As in the second cruell punick warre, The tents of Siphax, and of Hasdruball, Were all enflam'd by noble Scipio, So by the burning of this little groue, The mountaine quite consumd where Tubants lay, And they became our triumphs goodly pray: But in the wood that borders on the mount, The cruell Tigers hid their damned heads: The sauage Agriuarij kept their den, Who ranging now &amp; th? would snatch their pray, Renting each ioynt, disseuering each part, And neuer leaue till they had found the hart. Not Massagetes were so cruell calld, Nor Babilon was ere so strongly walld: For since Usipetes last confusion, They made the sea a moate vnto the wood, That great Alcides would haue wondered, To see this Iland so enuironed. Hard by the Southerne frontire of the wood, Danubiaes streames swelling in proud disdaine, Vnto the checker of the Ocean, Muttering repaid his tributarie due. There did I make my skilfull Pioners To cut a trench from great Danubius, That this new sea which walled in the wood, Was now the graue of their perdition. For when Danubiaes streames did meet the maine, The sauage Agriuarij all were drown'd, But such as swam to vs we would not sleay, That they might grace the honour of our day. Omnes. Long liue Victorious Germanicus, Ger. Twice did we meet the Buckstars in the field, And fortie thousand quite were vanquished Of stiff-neckt Chatti, neuer yet contrould, An hundred thousand perisht in one field, Not Cannas nor the fields of Pharsalie: So died in blood as was Danubius. And which my priuate ioy doth more obtaine, Of all the Romanes were but nintie slaine. This is the Theater of Germanie, And these the countries which I conquered, Now worthie Emperour I made a vow, To dedicate my sword to Ioues protection. If't please your Maiestie for to ascend, Vnto the Senate where Germanicus, Will all the secrets more at large disclose Meane-while my followers I you dismisse, Exeunt the souldier. And al my gracious friends with thanks I leaue, Vntil our Country rights we doe performe, Which done, Germaicus will soone returne. Omnes. Long liue the valiant Germanicus: Long liue Victorios Germanicus. Exeunt all in order to the Senate at one doore. Iulia Agripina, Liuia, and Caligula, at the other. Manet Nero, and Drusus Germanici. Nero. Drusus if you had beene so valerous As ouer-boasting in thy bumbast tearmes, We might haue seald our league of amitie, Now with Tiberius colde congealed blood. Drusus. And if thy bookish wisdom, clarkly art, had armed beene with Romane resolution, I tell thee Nero Coward as thou art, Tiberius should not thus haue scapt our hands, By Ioue my father was his coat of steale, Plac'd betwixt my sword and him, or els Nero. Or els thou would'st haue sworne, Volumes of six foote othes, but nere a blow. Dru. No more, my father comes. Nero. Coward, I doe retort it in thy teeth. Dru. Why Nero, brother, are ye mad? Enter Tiberius and Germanicus, Nerua, Sabinus, Asinius, Seianus, Piso, with other Senatours from the Senate. Tib. I hope this sodaine businesse of the East, Doth not agrate our sonne Germanicus. Ger. My Lord the honour of my Countries cause, doth counterpoize my sad affections. Tib. Farewell my honourable gallant sonne, The hope of Rome, my deare Germanicus, Piso farewell, remember well thy duetie, Once more adue my deare Germanicus. Seia. My Lord Germanicus the heauens conduct, Your high resolues to happie victorie. Exeunt Tiberius, Seianus, and Piso. Ger. Thanks good Seianus, gentle friend farewel Nerua. My Lord Germanicus I much lament, The strong rebellion of the Orient, My heart presageth what I dare not say, Farewell Germanicus for now I dare not stay. And yet I will: ah deare Germanicus! How doth old Nerua wish thy companie? And but my honour doth controule my will, I would Germanicusâfarewel, farewel. Ger. Nay good Cocceius, stay a little while, To heare, the last perchance I ere shall tell thee, So variable is the chaunce of warre. Vnto you three the patrones of my life, Nerua, Sabinus, and Asinius, Vnto your patronage I recommend, My Orphant children, and my widow wife, Faire Agripina. No more my Lord, let heauens tell the rest, Remember your true friend Germanicus. They embrace, and so part. Exit Cocceius, and enter Piso. Pis. My Lord 'twere time your busines were dispatcht, The iorney craues great expedition, and date of your abode is wellnigh out. Ger. Nor ought you to extenuate the same, What though the Senate hath decreed it so, Germanicus should giue adiew to Rome, Before to morrowes Sunne salute the world, Yet haue I some time to remaine therein. Which being small, that small space let me spend, To satisfie mine eyes with gazing on't, Who for these many winters haue desir'd, (Although in vaine) to resalute this place, and now no sooner resalute the same, But am constrained to bid it adiew, It may be neuer to returne againe. Pis. It may be? nay thats sure Speaking aside. The Senate hath decree'd, and it must be, There's no resisting of necessitie. Ger. Yet gentle Piso, suffer me to grieue, If at nought else, yet at necessitie, Too strickt for ouertoylde Germanicus, Whose wearie limmes, require a longer rest Then is one daies short intermission. Yet were it Piso but an houres space, Were all my bodie brus'd with bearing armes, Yet would Germanicus beare it as he may, and rather sinke vnder his armours weight, Then leaue to weare it in defence of Rome, To whome though Rome for harbour be deny'd, Yet hath he roome in all the world beside: Onely this respite, and I craue no more, To giue my wife and Sonnes their last farwell. Pi. You may, &amp; I wil cal th? presently. Enter Nero and Drusus. Ger. Do Piso &amp; be honoured for this fauour. But see thy sonnes Germanicus, thy sonnes, Declaring by their angrie clowded frownes, Some ciuill discord, or some discontents, For shame my boyes, if so a Fathers power, May haue predominance in sonnes dissent, Cleare vp those clowdie vapors of your browes, That threaten stormes of dreadfull discontent. Leaue off your ouer-daring menacies, and tell the cause of your dissention, Tell me, for I ought, must, and will know. Ner. Onely this (father) caus'd our controuersie, Going to the Capitoll to the Tryumph, We saw a Kite vsurpe the Eagles place, Wherat enrag'd, we cast our Falcons off, and for mine, was not of such speedy flight as was my Brothers, he began to chafe. Drus. Patience herselfe I thinke would be enrag'd, To see a man so faintly Faulconer it. For Father, had my Brother done his best, We might haue taken downe the Haggard Kite. Ger. What, for so small a matter fall at oddes? Fie, neuer violate true Brothers loue By furious rages and dissentious Iarres: It not befits your title, nor these times, Sad time wherein (perhaps) my last farwell, Is to be taken of my dearest Sonnes, Whom, if I leaue distract in factious hate, How can I hope to bid you once farwell, Since faring as I see, you fare but ill? My time of residence is short in Rome, and yet too long, if long you disagree, Be reconciled therfore to your selues, shake hands, embrace, be friendes, forget, forgiue: why so my Sonnes, thus should kind Brothers liue. Now is my heart, disburthened of great care, To see you my deare Sonnes accord so well, And though I straight must part, take this farewell left with you as my testimoniall will. Helpe, honour, cherrish, loue each other still, And thinke how oft you breake your amitie, So oft you act your fathers Tragedie. Enter Caligula with a Racket and Tennis-ball in his hand. Calig. Now a Gods name giue me a hand Ball, For that a man may tosse against the wall, Now vp, now downe, now flie, now fall, Yet hath no danger therewith all. Come brother, will you play a set? Germ. Crosse to my comfort, &amp; thy fathers grief Why doost thou still continew in these fits? What frantique humor hath bereft thy wits? Cast downe Caligula, cast downe thy ball. Cali. Nay by Ladie Father, nay first take my life away Take vp my ball, lay downe my Ball, tush, tush, To tennis with an Emperor is not worth a rush. Where's neuer a stroake but all in hazard plaide. No Father, ile doe with it as poore men doe With great mens iniuries, put it vp till time serue. Ger. Yet now at length, cease to torment my soule More scourg'd with sorrow to behold thee thus, Then Priam was to see his Illion burne. Oh speake like to thy selfe, speake to my ioy, More ioy vnto ioy-rob'd Germanicus, Then was the Lidian Cressus dombe borne Sonne, Stopping his Fathers execution. Calig. Not for the world father, pardon me: no, no. What? play the blab before such company? Ger. What company's heere, onely but we three. Cali. Mary too many sir, by he, and he. Ger. Sonnes stand aside, while we confer together Cali. Nay far enough, we neede no counsellors. Ger. Not on my blessing till our talke be done. Cal. Then father loe, your Metamorphiz'd sonne, Changed in wit, and in condition chang'd, Whose hellish fit hath left at length to rage, And plague my senses with a lunacie, Which hath made me to be esteem'd a foole, And so I am, and deeme it best be so: For he that would liue safe in brutish Rome, Father, a foolish Brutus must become. Ne blame me father, nor vpbraid me for't, His was by policie, mine by extacie, Which takes me euermore in companie. Nor (but coniured by your reuerend commaund) Could I haue halfe abstained from it thus. Ger. The strangest fit that euer I haue knowne. Which how er'e strong, yet striue to bridle it, Once giue repulse and you the conquest get, But time cuts off our talke, my glasse is runne, And date of my abode is almost done, Say therefore how doth Agripina fare? What makes her stay? how brookes she my depart? Cal. Briefly to say (my Lord) with an ill heart, For Lucius Piso with this balefull newes, No sooner gaue her notice of your state, And suddaine expedition to the East, But as if some Torpedo had her toucht, A numming slumber rockt her sense asleepe, And in a swound fell downe betweene nune armes: Then scarce remembring how or where she was, She lockt her winding armes about my necke, And thinking me to be Germanicus, She seald a thousand kisses on my lippes, Each being steeped in a stream of teares: And then she sighes and straight begins to frowne, Thrise she disioynd the cherries of her lips As if she meant to speake, and thrise she spake. Her voyce seem'd dead in labour with her words, And onely rendered an abbortiue sound, Till thrice recall'd at length recouered, She sighed forth, ah deare Germanicus! And wilt thou then so soone? What more she said, Drown'd in the sluent Ocean of her teares, Gasped a period to her abrupt speech. Ger. Ah me! and doth she still continue thus? Cal. Not now my Lord: for when as this was done, She wackt out of her slumbring extasie, Receyuing refruition of her senses, And then she blusht, and sight, to see her errour, And gan to frame excuses for her fault, Promising speedily to come to you. Enter Piso and Agripina. Ger. And here she comes. My deare Agripina: Agri. Most deare Germanicus. Nero. Ah! see how th'extremitie of loyall loue, Surceedes in passions of affection, as it denieth passage to their speech. Dr. Curst be the authors through whose occasion Happes the disseuering of so sweet an vnion. Nero. Faine would she bid him stay, faine say farewell, But feare and loue amaze her in misdoubt: She doubts to stay him, fearing to offend him, She loues too well, too willingly to leaue him: Ger. Enforct, I doome the sentence of my death, For can I liue if parted from my loue That art both essence of my loue and life? Enforc'd? I: yet not I, it is my tongue, Ore-ruld by too strict times necessitie, makes me pronounce this loathed word, farewell. Agri. Ill fare that word farewell, since by farewell I fare so ill: then bid me not farewell: Yet wish I not thy stay my dearest Lord, But that you would assent to one petition. Be not inquisitiue, speake not at all, Vnlesse when as you speake, you say I shal. Ger. I shall my dearest deare, if so you shall aske onely what shall be conuenient, and indisparageable vnto our good: Which for I doubt not, speake I giue consent. Agri. Then in thy little lesse then banishment, Refuse me not for thy companion, and this with teares I beg for ratified: Reuoke not what is promis'd, nor excuse With arguments drawne from my sexe and life, Too weak too feeble, and vnfit for warre, Or by relating all the miseries, Long trauels, dangerous toyles, misfortunes, wants; For all the ills that issue out of warre, I haue them past or passe not what they are. Witnesse this liuely Image of thy selfe, Of whom I was deliuered in the campe, Bellona was my Midwife, and my paines Were eased by the ayer-renting sounds, Of warlike Sackbuts, Clarions, and Drums. Ger. Thy loue doth make a wanton of thy leaue, and through extremitie of passion, You make me halfe to feare you leaue to loue: Pardon me Agripina, if my loue through feare to loose my loue, doth loue to feare, For life takes life from loue, loue growes from fear, Feare to dislike, feare to be faithlesse proou'd: Feare for to loose himselfe from his best belou'd, This fearing loue, and louing fearefulnesse, Doth bind my heart, and prison vp my tongue: Why wouldst thou this? I know thou wouldst it not. From stately Rome vnto the Suns arise, So many miles, so many mischiefs lies: Where shouldst thou haplesse me accompanie, The mischiefe were redoubled, and one houre, Perhaps should cause me die a double death. Once in my selfe, and ten times more in thee, Yet wouldst thou this? I know thou wouldst it not. Agr. Ay me, my Lord, your word controls my wil. Ger. Time entercepts my time, adieu, Deare Agripina once againe adieu. Piso. The time is now expired of our stay, And therefore you must either now agree, Or Madam gainst your will he must depart, For my part I will presently depart. Agri. Ah! stay a little while and I haue done. Ger. Madam, for all the world I dare not: fare yee wel Agri. And is your haste so great as his my Lord? Must Agripina then forsake her loue? Ger. Or else Germanicus must leaue his life. Therefore my deare, deare wife, and dearest sonnes, Let me ingirt you with my last embrace: And in your cheekes impresse a fare-well kisse, Kisse of true kindnesse and affectious loue, Bath'd in the licour of distilled raine, Which nere before dissolued into teares, Which falling lowly downe before your feete, Seeme for to beg a mutuall vnitie, To be continued after my depart. Which if you are resolued to maintaine, Then vse no dallying protractions, But now compendiously lets take our leaue, Agr. As wills Germanicus so must it bee, Farewell deare Lord therefore, this way for me: Exit Agripina. Nero, Drusus, and Caligula embrace Germanicus, and follow her. Germanicus at an other doore. Ger. Deare wife, deare sons, heauens your protectors be, The Gods our guide, farewell, this way for me. Enter Tiberius and Seianus. Ti. Thus is Germanicus our greatest feare dispatcht With subtill Piso to the Orient. Didst thou not see with what alacritie, All the Plebeians at his triumph showted At euery period of his pleasing song? How that discordant quire redoubled With their vntuned voyces relishing, Long liue Victorious Germanicus? But hees dispatcht into Armenia, And soone shall be dispatcht by Piso true. Seian. My Lord vpon mine honour Ile auerre, Speedie performance of this action, I so inueagled Piso, so inwrapt him, So coniured his traiterous resolution, Storing the villaine with such poysonous druggs, As neuer Circe nor Aetes knew, I so incenst his damn'd ambition, Soothing his humour, praising his great worth, Adding the fauours of Tiberius, That were Germanicus imperious Ioue, Piso would poyson him to gaine my loue. Tib. So much Seianus for Germanicus, But now an other cloud obscures our Sunne, Of lesser fauour, but of greater show, That same infamous Tigres Iulia. Nemia neuer saw a Lionesse Was halfe so furious as is Iulia. Didst thou not see her yawning sepulchre Rauening to swallow vp my Emperie? Did she not shew Augustus testament To haue discarded me from regiment? How can I brooke it? Do not make replie, If Nero liue, Iulia shall surely die. Seian. Then Iulia make thy quicke confession. Tiber. But yet there doth remaine a corasiue, A canker that doth gnaw my festered soule, Nero and Drusus yong Germanici, Whose youth is guided by two elder starres, Titius Sabinus, and Asinius, Were these made Counsellers to Proserpine, (For neither Minos nor sterne Eacus, Nor Rodamanthus were so iust as these,) Nero and Drusus might be soone entrapt. If that Seianus loues Tiberius, If euer Nero did repay his loue, Then see these Phosphori be made away, That dimme the glorie of our happie day. Heere take my Signet, vse what meanes thou wilt, Be Emperour, so I may haue my will, For euen as sure as Nero drawes his breath, Asinius and Sabinus dies the death. Seianus. If they did both Vlisses equalize, Matchles Penolepes vnmatched mate, And if Minerua should inclow'd their thoughtes, As Cipria wrapt her Achesiades: I, were Apollo their eternall friend, They should not liue if Nero sought their end. Tiberius. Meane while, as cleare from all suspition, Tiberius will leaue this wicked Roome. Iulia, Sabinus, and Asinius Shall rue the absence of Tiberius. Exeunt. Enter Nerua, Sabinus, and Asinius. Nerua. Who sees the Sunne incombred in darke cloudes, And exhal'd vapours dimme the welkins face, Followed in pursuite with th'assaulting winde, Which play their furious prizes in the ayre, And not expects a sharpe tempestuous storme? Sabinus. Who viewes the troubled bosome of the maine, Endiapred with Cole-blacke Porpesies, Prodigious Monsters, and presaging Signes, Markt in th'appearance of vnwonted shapes, Strange figures, and amazing Spectacles, and lookes not for a ciuill warre of wayles? Asinius. Who sees the rules to bee vnfaigned true, And not prouides preuenting remedies, Well might hee prooue the perrill to his paine. The Walles once battered by the boysterous Romaine, And open passage forced to their foes, Too late it is, for the engir't to plead In matters, where foresight might frame auaile Folly it is to trust to had-iwist. Late prouidence procures long repentance, And thus I quite you for similitudes. Nerua. Cancell that quittance Gallus, Nerua knowes, How deepe ensearching is Asinius skill, But yet I wonder you will sentence it, Rather then to acquire the hidden sence. Asiniu. Sence then is hidde in those similitudes. Nerua. I, such deepe sence as makes my sences droope. Sabinus. No, sences droope where sence of ill is none. Neru. Sharpe sence may sensure ill, all thoughts vnshowne. Asinius. Blinde is the censure of vncertainties. Nerua. I, to the eye which sees what open lyes. Sabi. You speake Ãnigmaes, doubtful and obscure. Neru. Yet not so darke and hard, as true and sure. Sabi. Then be mine Oedipus, interpret it. Neru. Not Oedipus, it needes a searching wit, A quicke conceite, an all obseruing minde, Tis that that must explaine this hidden sence, Such one was wont aged Asinius haue, Such grounded wisdome reaching at conceite, Like as the fire in chimicke distillation, Able to seperate the ellements. But wherefore weepes Asinius? thy griefe disclose, Nerua will heare, and helpe, who hath like woes. Asini. Not for my selfe I shed these brinish teares. Neru. Teares shed for Romes estate doe drowne mine eies. Sab. Hard state where vices liue, and vertue dies. Ner. Witnesse the secret counsels which are kept, Whereto no state of Senate is requested, But olde establisht orders quite detested. Sab. Like to a butchered body, Rome is rent, And secret factions, compleate treacheries, Are common set abroach by each degree. Ner. Nero hath tane adiew of stately Rome, And poasted downe into the Countrie, Nothing regarding his imperiall state, And heere Seianus reuils all alone, Free from the checke of Magistrates controule, Commaunding all, as he were Emperour. Sab. And with him keepes the high Augusta heere, But to what end, the Gods alone doe know: Who graunt that all may issue to the best. Asin. Amen, Amen, my minde presageth ill, And say we what we can, theile haue their will. Exeunt Asinius, Nerua and Sabinus. Enter Iulia and Seianus. Iuli. And dare Tiberius worke old Iuliaes death? Seia. Excellent Lady, worthy Iulia, Vpon mine honour Nero seekes your life. Iul. And can the heauens see and not reuenge? Not mad Orestes Clitemnestraes Sonne Was so vnnaturall as this beare-whelpe is. I did conceiue the villaine in my wombe, Which now I hate because it fostered him. Could I not get some Taxus to haue made, My wombe abortiue, when I him conciu'd? Nero, ah Nero! did I not procure, Thy first adoption by Augustus bounty? Caius and Lucius, thy elder Bretheren, One in Armenia, th'other lost in Spaine, And all that thou the Empire migh'st obtaine. Proud Phaeton, assend thy Fathers throane, And rouse the frozen Serpent from his Denne. Father of darkenesse, Patrone of confusion, Reduce the Caos of eternall night. Let heauen &amp; earth, &amp; aire, bee brought to nought, For Nero liues, and Iuliaes life is fought. Seia. In vaine the furie of such idle thoughts, Doe but augment the habit of your passion, The Virgin ayre doth onely heare your moanes, Which fleeting takes no impression of your griefe. In vaine you doe implore, the sencelesse creature, For to vnbinde the chaine of constant nature. Iul. Seianus! wise Seianus! louely man, What shall I call thee to obtaine thy loue? And yet I know, thou louest Iulia. Seia. Madam, vpon my honour I protestâ Iul. Protest no more, Seianus sweare no more, I doe beleeue thou louest Iulia: And may I trust Seianus with my loue? Seia. And may you trust Seianus with your loue? If I had not engag'd my honours pawne, If I had not admired Iulia; Loued Augusta more then mine owne life, How durst I haue disclosed CÃ¦sars drifts, Broke my allegiance to my soueraigne, Clearing the mistie cloudes of his reuenge, But that I lou'd you more then all the world. Iulia. Why then Seianus counsell Iulia, Aduise Augusta in her deepe extreames, Were it not cunning, tell me gentle friend, For to beguile the Lion of his pray? Seian. Augusta, CÃ¦sar is your noble sonne. Iulia. I, but he seekes the life of Iulia. Seian. Madam, he may be moued to pittie you. Iulia. Shall Iulia then entreat degenerate man, That neuer knew Augustaes royall spirit? Did Sophonisba beg her princely life, Or Anthonies Egyptian parramour? Did Philips high resolu'd Olympias, Crouch to Seleucus for her wearie dayes, And shall Augusta royall Iulia, Crouch, beg, entreate her boy Tiberius? Seian. Lady not so, Seianus will entreate. Iulia. Nor thou, nor any, shall entreat for me, Did not I beare him? who shall beg my life? I shame to heare thy foolish pittying, Did not we make Tiberius Emperour? And can we not depose Tiberius? Where are those volumes of inuentions, Which once had residence in thy conceit? Those massacres and golden pollicies, That ore thy fortunes euer houered? Record Seianus all thy Chronicles Diue to the bottome of thy memorie, And plot some laborinth of villanie. Do not Seianus all in vaine contend; Nero, or Iulia, or both must end. Seian. Royall Augusta, Iulia commaund, The vtmost that Seianus can inuent. Madam, you know that CÃ¦sar three dayes since, Remou'd his Court vnto Campania, Where by his Orchardâ Iulia. What by his Orchard? speake Seianus, speak, What doth the smoke of Lerna lurke thereby? Or Thebane Sphinx, or Memphis Crocadile, What Dipsas, or what Monster can we find, But halfe so cruel in his proper kind? Seia. There is a Caue Spelunca call'd Vaulted by arte, made by Geometrie, Whose top is wouen with a wauing vine, The leaues of tempred plaister flagging downe Are fann'd with motion of each little wind: The ruddie clusters of the grapes appearing, Liuely engrauen in dependant stones, Neuer Mausolus, nor Amphions towers, Nor Asiaes immortall workmanship, Dianaes Temple halfe so curious, as this entrenched earthly Paradise. But which encreaseth most a mazing wonder, With turning of one stone all fall's asunder. Iulia. What of this? what of the Caue Seianus? Seian. Here oftentimes the wearie Emperour, Doth banquet and refresh his troubled mind, Iulia. Enough Seianus, promise to turne the stone, Iulia is sicke, Augusta must be gone. Sei. Madam, vpon mine honour ile make him sure. Iulia. Farewell Seianus, I must needes be gone. Exit Iulia. Manet Seianus solus. Seian. Madam farewell. Go stepdame Iulia, Plot with Seianus for Tiberius death, But first go tell the Queene of fearefull Disse, and read a lecture there of policie, Neuer to trust a friend in secrecie. So then Seianus here Epitomize all thy deuises for to get the crowne. Betwixt thy hopes and thee are seauen lights, Seauen wandring planets, seauen obstacles, Tiberius CÃ¦sar, and Germanicus. The triple ofspring of Germanicus: Iulia, Agripina, and Liuia: All these Seianus twixt thy hopes and thee, But for Germanicus hee is eclipst, His Orient of honour is obscur'd, I hope ere this by Pisoes diligence. Iulia is in her struggling agonie, Betwixt the poyson and concoction: Drusus, Tiberius sonne, I meane to speede, And make his father for to murther him. Euen thus the Caue I told to Iulia, Is verie true, I doe not vse to lie, Not to complot the deepest villanie, Nor did I lie, ther's such a Caue indeede, And with one stone I can consume the worke, Some slender shallow polititian now, Would deeme it here a point of wondrous reach, To murther sonne and father in this Caue. Not so, Seianus hath a farther scope, Deeper conceit, and farre more misticall: The Caue shall fall and yet Tiberius liue, But I will seeme to vnderprop the Caue, With these my pillars, and beare all the loade, So shall I get more fauour with the Prince, That whom soeuer I shall countenance, Shall seeme as ere repealed Oracles. Then will I worke this credulous conceit, To what impression my braine inuents, Ile to Campania. Now first haue at his sonne, Then for himselfe when all my plot is done. Exit Seianus. Enter Germanicus, and Piso at one doore, Uonones and his sonne at the other. Ger. Uonones though this proud rebellion Disturbe the vniuersall vnitie, although this vtmost member of the world, Hath made a separation from the head: Though thou and thy proud sonne in daring armes Haue made our Eagles sweat in thy pursuite: Yet know a Roman is thine enemie, Whose Legions farre surpasse in Chiualrie, The triple Phalaux of Armenia. Were euerie man a furious Elephant, Rul'd by a Castle of Numidians, These Germane Legions would encounter them, and these new squadrons out of Italy, Would striue with them in glorious emulation, Till with the spoile of vanquisht Elephants, They might encampe a pale with Iuorie. Yet know my mercie farre exceedes my strength. an Oliues branch wreath'd with humilitie. Shall win more fauour with Germanicus, Then all the Ensignes in Armenia can. Speake then Vonones, wilt thou fight or yeeld: Von. Germanicus, as to my hostile friend, Vonones knowes thy honourable minde, admires, but nothing feares thy victories. Except thy person, Thus much for your state. Germanicus, tis no rebellion, For to maintaine our ancestors renowne, It is your pride to seeke Dominions, Finding occasions still to conquer all: First Romulus encreast his Colonies, By ruine of his neighbour borderers, Within the circuit of faire Italy, Subiected to your Lordly Empirie: Then must Scicilia be your grauarie, Carthage be sackt for emulation, Spaine must find horses, France an enemie, Because that Brennus scal'd the Capitoll, Yong Philip in the second punicke warre, Must be reclaim'd by old Ãmilius, Mithridates for helping Perseus, Must pay a ransome of all Asia To Taurus Mountaine; yet not so content, Except he yeeld vp Lisimachium, For him Tigranes, Ptolomie for Anthonie, My Grandsire for great Pompeys dignitie, Must yeeld the title of his royaltie: Romanes, you wrong the world by false pretences, To make them al your vassaile Prouinces: How did the Britaines wrong your Empirie? The Gallogretians, or the Scithians? What did Numidia, or what did Germanie? The late Caracter of thy victorie. Let fearefull Cowards to the Romanes yeeld: Vonones will fight out this blodie field. Exeunt both wayes, and enter againe to fight. Vonones and his sonne flie. Enter Germanicus and Piso. Ger. Now are these Orientall braueries quail'd these rauening wolues hem'd in their lurking dens: Tigramenta, were it proud Babylon, Glew'd with Alphaltes slime impenetrable, Were it Pireus, or Seleucia, Germanicus would neuer leaue assault, Till it were subiect to Germanicus. Sound them a parley. Enter Uonones as vpon the walles. Germanicus speaketh. Ger. Vonones, first to thy vpbraiding taunts, Which then thy furie would not let thee heare, Thou callest vs Romanes too ambicious, Competitors to all the worlds Demaine, Proud to insult vpon Dominions, By faigned shew of some receiued wrong: First know Vonones that great Romulus, Diuinest ofspring of th'immortall Gods, Neuer vsurpt vpon his neighbour bounds, Without the iust occasion of reuenge: Witnesse the tempests of the Solines troopes, And Titias Titaias doubtfull trecherie: Scicilia we redeem'd from seruitude, From Carthage bondage, whose ambicious pride, Fiue hundred thousand slue in Italy: Spaine as a bettors of false Hanniball, Subdued by Africans to our rule, France, Philip, Perseus, and Mythridates, Tigranes, Ptolomie, and Numidians, Bold Brytons, Scithians, Gallogrecians, Neuer without defiance were surprizde, Neuer without iust cause we them defied: Vonones thou dost know this to be true, Yet your presumption makes you all to rue. Vono. Germanicus were all the Romane spirits, Imbarkt within thy royall curtesie, Or were thy spirit infused into all, Tigranocerta by the die of warre, Should neuer make my realme vnfortunate. Vonones would be to Germanicus A vassaile subiect, tributarie King. Ger. Vonones, not vnto Germanicus, But vnto Nero bend thy humble knee: If at our Eagle thou wilt lay thy crowne, Then saile to Rome, and in the Capitoll There reintreate great CÃ¦sars clemencie, Yeeld vp thy Citie, and dismisse thy force. Vonones I admire thy valourous minde, This is the way to find Tiberius kinde. Uon. Germanicus, how much I honour thee! Vonones fawnes not for his libertie, For know, before that tyrant shall insult Ouer the Armenian Orientall Prince, Euen by the Sun, and all his counsellors, The autour of our royall progenies, Scale, burne, assault, batter, vndermine, Renue as oft your wearied Legions, as Polinices, or the Thebane wall, Nothing but death Vonones shall enthrall. Germ. Then to the fight, and heauen I trust will ayde vs in our right. Germanicus and Piso scale the walles, Germanicus is repulst the first assault, Piso winneth the wall first, but is in danger by Vonones and his sonne: Germanicus rescueth Piso, Vonones and his sonne flie. Che sara, sara, maugre all their force, Tigranocerta, is subdued to vs. Romanes assault the Keepe, let them not breath, Till with the cinders of the fired Tower, Your dreadfull furie cleane dissolued be. Sound a parley within. Piso. But harke, th'Armenians doe a parly craue, I thinke thei'l yeeld, and so our labour saue. Ger. Then sound terror to their melting hearts. They resound a parley, and Uonones on the Keepe. Uon. Germanicus, and Romane conquerours, Imperious Lords of Fortunes Emperie, Vonones here vpon his suppliant knee, Which euer yet was like the Elephants, That had no sinew, had no bending ioynt. Here he that neuer begg'd, doth now entreat Aboone, a glorious boone: Germanicus, Tis not my life: Vonones heart would breake Before his tongue should be his Oratour. Tis not Captiuitie, nor Towne, nor Friendes, Nor Realme, nor wife, nor my posteritie, Germanicus, it is a boone of fame Vonones beggs, that nere will beg againe. Ger. And as I liue, Vonones shall obtaine, How honour crost by chance, reuiues againe! Vonones. Then thus, in single combat I defie, Some worthy man at armes, that dare performe, This honorable challenge in the field, If that Vonones liue, this is the boone, For foure and twentie houres to haue my scope, For to ordaine a new supply of warre. If I be vanquish't, vse the law of armes. Germ. Discend Vonones, on my honours pawne For to performe this resolution. Germanicus comes downe to the Stage. Romaines, on your alleagiance be gone, Perswasion is the sight of present death: I see the Garlands dangling in the skies, Of Coruin and Torquates victories. Uonones commeth downe, they fight and breath, Vonones being wounded. Uon. Curs'd bee the houre, and curssed bee the lampe, Which giues the influence to my haplesse being: I had not deem'd that twentie thousand soules, Could haue ore' quelled in a single fight, My armour, purpled with vermillion blood, (More then the Scarlet blush the maker gaue:) You hel-bred furies, I plague you all in hell. That thus do torture me: come on thou Targ of Rome. Fight againe, and Vonones is slaine. Ger. Ah noble Spirit, and art thou quite extinct? Gallant Vonones much I pittie thee, Too much dere earth oppresse him not with weight Whose minde was eleuated whilst he liued. Let lillies decke his euer-flowring toombe. And Rosets border on his wayled graue, Sweet Nightingales participate his breath, Helpe to immortallize his glorious death. Piso and all the Romaines come downe from the wall to Germanicus, and Germanicus speaks to them. Now braue Centurions, worthy Legions, After the night of labour, honours day Bring foorth the murall Crowne and Ornaments. Pis. Germanicus, whose head shall this adorne? Ger. His that deseru'd it, and I deeme 'twas I. Pis. Know nay Germanicus, but it was I That first repulst th'Armenians from their walles, First pitcht my Eagle in the conquered Towne, Not honour, nor imperious ambition, Can make a Romaine yeeld his honours title. I scald the sconce, therefore the Crowne is mine, I pitcht mine Eagle, mine are the Ornaments; And by my soule, and by Bellonaes night, Piso will haue his owne, his Crowne, his right. Ger. Piso shall haue his owne, shal haue his right, But for the murall Crowne (my honours meede) The glorious Signet of my victorie: First stars shall turne vpon this earthly pole, Bound to this shadie Orbes circumference. And heards of beasts shall graze on earthly pasture Betwixt the Lyon and the double Beare, Nature turn'd topsey turuey fore that day, Piso my honours Crowne shall braue away. Pis. Braue! Piso will not Braue, his deeds shal plead Ger. His deedes alacke are tongue-tide Oratours, Without ambition I pleade my right. Did not I my selfe in th'first assault, Thrice change my Target ouer poys'd with Darts? Did not I brandish in the second fight, My burning Semiter? that all their eies, Could not indure the heate of his reflection? Then in the midst of all the frontiers strength Hew'd me a passage to Vonones Sonne, Whose dying Ghoast bare record of my force, That did dismay their power, disman their walles, There fixt mine Eagle, then vnbard their Gates, And streight remounted to assault the Keepe. Perchance that Piso by some posterne gate, Crept through a meuse, &amp; by the winding stayres, Panting and breathlesse, stale vp to the walles. But Iâ Pis. Nay stay Germanicus, my heart doth throb, Mine eares doe glowe, to heare thy brauing taunts: I am a Soldier, and as good as thou, But for the childish rumor of thy name: And shall I loose by these insulting tearmes The Crowne of honour that Thaue deseru'd? Not one sault drop of Sweat, that I haue spent, But honour's fountaine shall repay againe. Germanicus, Piso will haue his due, Or thou or he, this fact of thine shall rue. Centur. My Lords, what dismal surie doth ench?t Your noble Spirits to this mortall strife? The Romaine millitarie lawes enforce, That in these graue demurres the Soldiers quest, Should giue the honour by a whole consent: Are you my Lord Germanicus content, And you Lord Piso with our Romaine lawes? Ger. Worthy Centurion with all my heart. Pis. I must perforce, or else not haue my part, Cent. Speak Soldiers, Piso or German. Sol. Germanicus, Germanicus, the Crowne is to Germanicus Centu. Trumpets, relate to heauen this Vnitie. Germanicus sitteth downe, Piso at the other end of the Stage sprinckleth Powder on the Crown, and then he setteth it on Germanicus his head, Trumpets sound. Pis. I lost the Crowne, but I haue won the day, Long liue Victorious Germanicus. Ger. Piso grieue not at Iustice equitie, Mine honour's dearer Piso then my life, Except this grudge, Piso, I honour thee, Depute thee Lord Armenian gouernour, To grace thy vertue and reward thy paine, Farwell good Piso, ile to Antioche, Exit. Ger. &amp; Sol. Pis. I, goe Germanicus but nere returne, That Crowne shall be the last thou ere shalt weare, That garland decks thy speedy funerall: If that Germanicus passe Antioche, Piso's a foole, Seianus had no wit: That powder which I sprinckled on the leaues, Me of my death, him of his life bereaues. Exit Piso. Enter Tiberius Solus. Tib. I am dispos'd to meditate alone, Here in my Orchard, let none dare trouble me: These Poppies too much aspire, they are too high, I must needes make them headlesse for their pride, And sure their seede, would breede a deadly sleepe, Should I not crop them, in their flowring prime: These marigolds, would fellow with the Sunne, If I should suffer them to sprout on high, But ile confine their stature to my measure: So will I doe with all competitors. Here's an olde roote doth hide the rising plants, And that doth make me thinke on Iulia. Where is Seianus, that incarnate diuell, Hath he not ended yet my greatest euill? I doe misdoubt the Villaine, oh the slaue! He may bewray me to the Senators: He may disclose me vnto Iulia: He may discouer me to Germanicus: He may doe what he will, to seeke my end. Exit Tiberius. Enter the Ghoast of Germanicus. Ghoast. Ingratefull Nero, and ingratefull Rome, Vnto the merrits of Germanicus, Reuenge my causelesse wrongs, great Proserpine, Who murthered was by hatefull treacherie. Me thinkes I am a man, and now could raue, That nere before did know what anger ment. This murall crowne wrought my vntimely death, By Pisoes enuie, and Tiberius pride. Germanicus, poore soule doe not complaine, For prayers cannot thy life restore againe, I will goe see my Children and my wife, That I may thinke on them in this new life. Exit Ghoast. Enter Agripina at one doore, Drusus and Nero at the other crying out, as from their Beds. Ner. My father, my deare Lord Germanicus. Agr. My husband, my deare Lord Germanicus. Dru. My father, my deare Lord Germanicus, Mother and Brother, helpe Germanicus, Fie sluggish Brother, draw thy balefull sword, Mother, fling wilde fire at the Crockadile, For nothing else can peirce his brazen skales. Agr. Drusus, what spirit doth disturbe my Sonne? Dru. Mother, me thought I saw Martichora, The dreadfull hiddeous Ãgiptian beast, Horrid and rough slimy and terrible, Fac'd as an Hidra like some vnquoth man, Whose eares hang drayling downe vnto hir feete, Sweeping the loathsome soile with greedinesse, Fang'd with three Iron grates of steely tuskes, Wall eyed, with collour steept in deepest bloud, With Lyons clawes, and Scorpions poysonous sting Wouen in Gorgias hundreth thousand knots, His murmuring sound, mixt of two Simphonies, Rebellowed twixt a flute, and trumpets sound, That seem'd the world with roring to confound. By him me thought I saw a gallant beast, A princely Lyon, crown'd with honours meede, At which this vgly Monster wrought amaine, For to defeate the Lyon of his pray, But all in vaine, till this deceitefull beast, Belcht foorth an ayrie death-infecting breath, At which me thought the Lyon vanished. And my deare Father, great Germanicus, Plac'd in his roome by this beast perrished: Twice thus I dream't, and still my thinkes I dreame, But mother, what did your affrighting meane? Agri. Oh Sonne! I dream't that in the azure skye, For one Epicicle two Sonnes did striue, One darted rayes, th'other rainebowes made: One suckered plants, the other moou'd the fire: One shining, tother dimme: one true, tother false, And in this discord all in heauenly motion, The hoast of starrie cloudes did hide the ayre. These hideous monsters met in furious rage, As if the world had beene dissevered. Like when a Whale runs in the boysterous maine, Seeming to shoulder all the yeelding waues, So by contrition of this dawning night, The Axeltree of heauen did seeme to mooue: From whence, as from an anuile seem'd to streame, A day of lightning, and a thunder bolt, Which rending passage to the Orient, Seem'd for to light vppon Germanicus. This frighted Agripina in her Dreame, But Nero what did thy vpstarting meane? Nero. My thought I sawe a snowye milke white Swan Encountring with a rauening bloody Stork. When in the furious heate of all their broyle, The Storke was succoured by a neighbour Crane, The Swan relieued by a dunghill Cocke, All ioyne in battaile, all to furious. But whether by faire Venus prayers to Ioue, Or other fate, the Swan and gallant cocke, Ceaz'd on the Crane, and carkasse of the Storke, All which seem'd pleasing to my slumbring sence, But all too rufull that which after fell, Fell discord twixt the Swan, and Cocke arose, The peerelesse Swanne was worthy Conquerour, But yet alas the gallant Cocke.â Enter Maximus a messenger from Germanicus, he knocketh at the doore. But who disturbes vs at this time of night? Where is the Porter with the Citties watch? Max. Open, ah open vnto Maximus. Dr. The faithful Maximus, God send good newes. Enter Maximus. Agr. Too much I see, I dare not heare the rest, And yet I will: nay farwell Maximus, I will not feare, yet feare comes gainst my will, Mine eares are stopt, how doth Germanicus? Max. O! were I mute, or had my carefull nursse; Nere taught this dolefull Engine for to speak; Then should my soule in mourning silence groane. Agr. Ah deere Maximus by all that ere was deare Within thy trustie heart, make no delaies, Tel Agripina: rid her of her feare, My heart is hardned euen the worst to heare. Max. Then Madam sithence we left this stately Rome Proud in the Triumphes of Germanicus. My Lord first sayled to Brandusium, So to Achaia and from thence to Rhodes. From thence to Ephesus, from Ephesus To Lisimachium we bent our course, Thence to the mountaine Taurus marcht by land. Sheluing on which we coast Armenia, and in her firtill bowels pitcht our Tents. Vonones three leagues off displaide his flag, The scarlet Ensigne of his bloody minde, There like two heards of Lyons, we inrang'd Our squadron to their Phallax, to their darts, Our slings: against their Cammels, all our horse. Betwixt our armies Tigris swiftly ran, and there within a league on our right hand, A deepe-delu'd Caue, (fit ambush to intrap) All vaulted with a young disprayed groue. Here with fiue hundreth foot-men light of armes, My Lord did place me till he gaue the signe: So in the heate our Legions seem'd to flye, Till all Vonones armie past the floud, And in pursuite of our supposed flight, There all enuironed with hidden troopes, That saw Vonones and his fierie Sonne. And some few more, which them accompained, We made an ende of this rebellion. Tigranocerta then we all inclos'd, And wonne it, and my Lord Germanicus, In single combat, slew their gouernor. Ag. Ah my deare Lord! how fares Germanicus? Max. I, thats the dismall newes I haue to tell, Leauing the Orient thus in setled peace, And Piso Pretor of Armenia, We marched to the Cittie Antioche, Whereas my Lord had heard were Christians, Iudeian Priestes, the which did magnifie, An vnknowne God, in dayly pietie. Before the Cittie grew a Cipresse Groue, Strew'd vnderneath with fading Violets, Where Gastly Screach-owles hold their residence, True Prodigies, of fatall miseries. about the midday of Antipodes, When our Horrizon was benum'd with sleepe, a furie and a passion both at once, Began surprize my Lord Germanicus. Agr. Oh heauens!â She fainteth and is vpheld by her Sons. Dru. Mother you promis'd for to heare the worst and can you not indure the first assault? Agrip. Yes Maximus, tell out the dyrest wo, My hart conceiues more grief then thou canst shew Max. What time the liuing diall of the night, His first alarum, rang to Cipria, Gall of my soule, I saw that woefull sight, Wherein my Lord (tormented) meekely lay, Like to a Lyon in his generous kinde, Doth gnaw the earth, in felnesse of his minde, Grudging sorrow but disdaines to moane, Or rore in torment of his agonie, So lay Germanicus in grieuous paine: Yet griefe from outward shew did much restraine, But feeling that his spirits gan to faile, and vitall pulses leaue their motion, He cald for Plato, and there two houres red, Of the immortall essence of the Soule, So constant in his soules Diuine releeuing, That griefe euen grieu'd herselfe, for him not grieuing Then to his friendes, he gaue this last farwell, Deare friendes, and worthy countrymen adiew, Had I in this faire May of all my glorie, By fates Eternall hand beene catcht from earth, I might accuse the Iustice of the Gods: But since by Piso, and his poysonous drugs, Germanicus is lost; reuenge my death. Agri. Enough, too much: O I can beare no more, Exit Nero Good Nero goe, run to Sabinus house. And treate him come, and comfort thy sad mother, Drusus goe thou vnto Asinius lodge, Exit Drusus And wooe him hether to thy sorowing Mother. But was my Husband poysoned by that slaue? O Monstrous hell-hound of ambition! Max. No man could proue it, but it was surmis'd, Both by the dying words of my deare Lord, And by the suddaine swelling of his head, That like a snow white Leaper was defilde. As by the heart of great Germanicus, Whose body being burnt, that yet vntoucht, A certaine note of poyson still remain'd, Which I embalmed with Arabian spices, Mixt with the ashes of my dearest Lord: Haue in this Allablaster box preseru'd, The onely Relique of this Tragedie, Which to you worthy Ladie I present, Yours it was liuing, yours it must be dead. Agrip. I had it liuing, and must haue it dead, all may befall that must necessitie. Flye liuing soule, into this liuelesse heart, That it may animate my greater part. Or else (Oh Gods) graunt this felicitye That here my breathing soule may tombed be. Mine eyes shall drizell down Arabian mirrhe, To garnish all Armenian infections Or falling from my eye-balles couered be, With this faire couer of sad miseries. I must needes looke vpon this last reliefe, Which swels, as being angry for my griefe. Ah my Germanicus! thus to hold thy heart, Yeeldes me no comfort, but augments my smart. Nero returneth. Ner. Mother, Sabinus some two houres since, Is gone to visite faire Elizium. Agri. What to thy Father my Germanicus? Drusus returneth. Drus. Mother, Asinius Gallus very weake, Expects the fatall houre of his death, Phisitians tell him he is poysoned. Agrip. Too much my Sonne, great sorrow still is dumbe. Exeunt omnes. Enter Plebeians with one of Maximus his Soldiers. 1. And is it true, did Piso poyson Germanicus? Sold. True, I as true as this is an Armenian Louse, that bit me by the backe, &amp; I am sure I carried none out of Rome with me: for his head sweld, his hayre would not burne, and hee dyed in a furie, and we al know that Piso had mortall hatred against him because he wold not let him haue his mural crown. 2. O Germanicus Germanicus! oh good Germanicus! the very h?nisuckle of humanity, &amp; the Mary-gold of magnanimitie: Piso is not to be c?pared to him. Piso noe, he is to him (euen in the creame of his nature) the verie lees of licentiousnes, the Veriuice of villany, the very excrement of euil, &amp; which is more, he had no reason to poyson him. 3. Good Germanicus, oh when shall I make thee an other payre of boots that would euen smile wh? they should come vppon his legges? O I shall neuer make such merrie bootes againe, for all the drie leather in my shop I warrant will weep intirely when they heare this newes. Sol. Consent to me, Piso will be heare presently (he thought to haue beene heere before vs) consent to me, lets plague him for Germanicus. 1. Agree'd, and lets rost him in his skinne, as you rost a Cat. 2. Nay, lets drowne him aliue, or else bury him quicke Sold. Nay, will you all keepe touch, and weele teare him ioynt by ioynt when woe haue got him, therefore stand close, for I heare his horse neigh, tho Asse will be heere presently. Enter Piso. Pis. Haile Mother Rome. Sol. I, stormes of vengeance on thy curssed head, 1. Where is Germanicus? speake! 2. Speak! what hast thou done with Germanicus? Pis. I cannot tell. All. But wee will make thee tell. They drag him in, and enter againe with his lines in their hands, they shout and cry. Omnes. Thus haue we sent reuenge to our deare Lord Thus haue we sent Germanicus reuenge. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Tiberius and Seianus out of the Caue. Tibe. Sejanus. Seia. My Lord. Tibe. Ho Sejanus. Seia. Here my gracious Lord. Tibe. A plague vp? him, that first made this Caue It was not sumptuous, not faire enough To be the Tombe of a liue Emperour. Thankes to my Genius, and thy prouidence, That hath defended me from farther ill, And yet my shoulders feele the heauie loade, Sirra a brush: Vanish the monuments of antique worldes, Mew'd in externall silence be obscured, Not Thesius loue vnto Perrithous Not Alexanders to HÃ¦phestion, Nor the two Bretheren of Paris sworne. That in eternall courses scale the heauens, Did euer manifest such demonstrations, Of faith vnfaign'd, and more then Turtle-doue, Saued my life, now by my Geneus If all the world were ten-times multiplied, And one of them were made of massie gold, Enameled with Pearles and Diamonds, Embost with Iasper and Alites vertue: Yea were all these imaginarie worlds, Vnder Tiberius his dominion, This world, this rough-cast world with precious Iems, Should be the guerdon of my saued life. Ah my Seianus, what can Nero find, To counter-ballance such a faithfull minde. Seian. Most gracious CÃ¦sar mightie Emperour, Had Pellion and Cossa beene conioy'nd, Had mounting Tenarus with the snowie Alpes, And high Olympus ouerwhelm'd the Caue, Yet would Seianus (like Briarius) Haue beene embowell'd in this earthie hell, To saue the life of great Tiberius. Tib. Now haue I tried the trunesse of thy stampe, Bith'touchstone of this late oppression, Nero repayes thy loue with vsurie, But by my Geneus how this suddaine feare Hath made vs cleane forget our mothers care. Tell me Seianus, how fares Iulia? Seia. My Lord she doth c?mend her to your grace But very weake vpon a surfet taken. Tib. As how Seianus? old folkes vse good diet. Seia. And so did she my Lord, at supper time She tooke a kernell of restoratiue, In a Pomgranet, which did so preuaile As that left her sicker with her Phisicke: Asinius and Sabinus her deare friends, From that Apothecarie did receiue, The like restoratiue with like effect: And then I poasted to your Maiestie. Tib. Iulia, Sabinus, and Asinius, For each a teare, so to Elizium. But what Seianus note I in thy face? The seale of feare though well dissembled, Are they not all dispatcht why dost thou feare? Seian. Vpon mine honour all are perished Tib. What doth thy conscience then disturbe thy soule? What meanes the carelesse rowling of thine eyes? Thy louing sorow, foulding of thine armes? Thy suddaine sighs, thy wauering countenance? Now all thy blood doth ebbe into thy heart, Now all thy blushing visage ouer-flowes, Speake my Seianus, sauer of my life, And by my Geneus thou shalt obtaine. Seia. Feare and allegiance, dutie and affection, Honour and pittie loyaltie and loue, Raise mutuall tumults in my clouen heart. Tib. Speake good Seianus, Nero longs to heare, The mutinous dissention of thy feare. Seian. May be my Lord Seianus feares in vaine. Tib. Let CÃ¦sar know, least CÃ¦sar feare in vaine. Seian. What if my Lord it do concerne my hurt? Tib. Yet tell to CÃ¦sar who can cure thy hurt. Seia. I am perswaded that it is but forg'd. Tib. Well, howsoeuer I commaund thee shew. Seia. Faulter my tongue thou dolefull instrument, Infortunate to tell so bad a storie. Pardon my Lord. Tib. Seianus I commaund. And by my Geneus I will be obeyed. Seia. Then heauens beare witnes what I do record Comes of no malice nor ambition, For of mine honour I do thinke it forg'd. My Lord, since you lay in Campania, It is a rumour blowne by vulgar winde, That you will neuer backe returne to Rome, I could not gesse on what presumption: But when I first assaulted Iulia, And she had swallowed vp the poysonous baight, Faith then in loue vnto her Ladiship, I told her that your grace did seeke her death. Not Menus with the frantike dames of Thrace, (That in their Dionisian sacrifice, Mangled the bodie of poore Pentheus) Raued like Iulia in her passion. Tib. O how it doth me good to heare her mad! Seia. May it please your Maiestie to giue me leaue Here to set downe a dolefull period. Ti. No by my Geneus Nero will heare all. Seia. After the furie, anger tooke her throne, Like a fierce Lion chaft to seeke reuenge, When wooing me with many honie words, Of good, and wise, and friend, and debonaire, Idle sinononimies of womens wit, she all to prayed my constant secrecie And I to heare the summall exigent, Swore neuer to reueale her policie Whilest Iulia and Seianus both should liue. And I haue kept my promise with her to. Then did she seeme to wooe me with her lookes, But good my Lord let her Seianus leaue, For on mine honour all may be but forg'd. Tib. If thou concealest but one sillable, Nero will hate thee in eternitie. Seia. My Lord, great Iulia said she would preuent Tiberius in his Tygers crueltie: She swore my ayde, she swore my secrecie, Adding a gift to euerie worde she spake: This Ring, this Signet of Augustus Armes, This Iewell, picture of your noble father, Yet Iulia you know my Lord was wise, And all may be but forged pollicie: She said how she deuised had the plot, In this Campanian cecession. (Oh Gods forsend) to end Tiberius daies? Tib. Tis well Sejanus shee'sâbut proceede. Seia. The day before the blustering Ides of March Which as I take it, this day is expired. (That made me poste so hastily from Rome) On this same fatall day, olde Iulia swore, Hir Sonne Tiberius should be poysoned. But by whose means, my Lord I must conceale, For of mine honour I doe thinke it forg'd. Tiber. Conceale a Traytor, and my guard shal lop Thy ioynted carkasse: goe too tel me all. Seia. Why then my Lord, imagine all is false, And what I say, is all but counterfaite. Doe not conceiue that Drufus your deare sonne, Aspires to be a present Emperour: Beleeue not that this day he makes a feast, Where mightie CÃ¦sar, should be poysoned. Thinke not that Spado that Twig soone bent to it, Is now corrupted to performe the act, Who tasting first vnto your Maiestie, With a Vine-branch enfoulded on his arme Will squease in poysonous drugs to slay my Lord. Imagine this to be a lying dreame, Though Iulia sware and vow'd it should be so, And made great ioyance, that it should be so; Beleeue it not surely she said not true, For on mine honour I doe thinke it forg'd. Tiber. No, no, Sejanus, I haue well obseru'd, The haughtie stomacke of th'aspiring Boy, But Ile pull downe his lofty crested plumes, And teach him homage to his soueraigne. How dare the stragling elfe, once looke on mee, And not be turn'd into an Aspen leafe, To tremble at each breathed sillable? Seia. Be patient, good my Lord, perhaps tis false: Or be it true, as who would once conceiue, Such headlong furie in ambitious thoughts? Did not Mithridates Pontus King, Forgiue Phraates his rebellious Sonne? Did not Iugurthus father, often checke His high aspiring thoughts? yet him forgaue: Tiber. Talke of forgiuenesse in some pettie Kings Not in the state of mightie Emperors, This day he dooth prouide Thyestas feast, And bids his father to the bloudy cates. Perswade me not, Seianus I will goe, I haue already promis'd him to come, And if the villaine offer me these drugs, Ile make him swill the cup, I should carrouse. Enter Spado toward them. But heere comes Spado his fine instrument, See where his Garland is, ile stab the Slaue. Seia. No good my Lord, how can you then inquire The hatefull Treasons of your wicked Sonne? Tib. Tis true Seianus, I will hold my hands. Seia. Oh how I fear'd I should haue beene betraid Spad. Euer Augustus! Drusus royall banquet, Requires the presence of Tiberius. Tiberi. Spadowe come. They draw aside the Arras, and banquet on the stage, Spado tasteth to Tiberius, and after infuseth the poyson. Spe. My Lord, yong Drufus wisheth happinesse, To Nero CÃ¦sar in this Cup of wine. Tiberi. Drusus doe thou begin vnto Tiberius. Dru. My Lord may 't please you here is other wine. Tibe. But taste of this my Sonne, I'm sure tis good. Dru. Here is the like my gracious Lord beside. Tiber. It may be like, but not so altogether. Drus. Tis of the same. Tiber. Well, please my humor Sonne. Drus. Why good my Lord. Tiber. By Ioue ile haue it so. He drinketh and falls downe, Seianus stabbeth Spado. Enter a Messenger. Mess. Where is the Emperour? Augusta is deade. Tib. Goe tell that newes to Proserpine. Stabs him. Another Messenger. Mes. Where's CÃ¦sar? great Germanicus is dead. Tiber. Commend me to Germanicus. Stabs him. Another Messenger. Mes. Where's Nero, Piso is by the Plebeians slaine Tibe. Let Rauens and Vultures gorge on his flesh and thine. Stabs him. Another. Mess. Where is Tiberius? where is CÃ¦sars grace? Asinius and Sabinus both are dead. Ti. Go greet th? both thus fr? Tiberius. Stabs him. How now what newes bringst thou? speak villain speake. Seianus commeth toward him, and he maketh at him. Seianus cryeth out, and Nero stareth on him. Seia. No newes my Lord, I am Seianus I, I sau'd your life my Lord, I am Sejanus. Tib. Pardon Sejanus onely faithfull friend, The headlong furie of a troubled soule, I dare not trust my selfe to see my Sonne. O who would weare a Crowne to be tormented? Sejanus I must ride in poste to Rome, To reigne the furie of the common heard, See these foule carkasses be buryed. Goe to Sejanus, when I haue my will, He speaketh this aside. Ile make thee Patterne of thy Villaines. Meane while I will to Rome to finde the bookes, Augustus wrote, and left with Iulia. Exit Tiberius. Seia. Why this is well, Germanicus is gone With Iulia and with Drusus into hell. Follow Sejanus, Noe: thy wits I meane, Alas poore Drusus, troth I pittie thee, And Spado too, me thinkes now I could weepe, But that it is too womanly: this chopping boy Whome I corrupted for this Stratageme, I did him a great fauour, had he liued Tiberius would haue had him tortured, Hang'd by the Nauell for confession. Drusus, for thee, I could haue wisht thy life, But reason did in force thy destinie. First that thou wert heire to Tiberius: Next an obseruer of my secrecies, Thirdly thy Liuia, that Queene of beautie, The eldest Daughter to Germanicus, Sejanus secret friend, thy secret foe, Next to Germanicus, heyre to the Crowne, Thy sometime, now my wife, if heauens agree, To make me heire vnto a Princes Throne, Nay more, an Empyre thus shall be mine owne: Fourthly the blow which I receiu'd in peace, Vntill reuenge might satisfie my will: All these, or any were sufficient: I am sorry, I haue vs'd thee too too well, Now to the summe of all my foes are left: Tiberius CÃ¦sar, with him Agripina, Nero and Drusus the Germanici. Then thus the fierce enrag'd Germanici, I will insence against Tiberius As the sole agent in their fathers death, Shew them the fauours of the Senators, The Plebeians harts inchained to their beckes, Faire baites for to allure their young conceites. Rebellion Ile intitle honourable, And if that we obtaine the victorie As I haue bound them Legions to mine hoast, Then will I haue my spies, my fawning Curs, My hireling hell-hounds in the battailes heate, To murther both the yong Germanici. Tiberius vanquisht, and these made away, CÃ¦sar Seianus, Empresse Liuia. Exit Seianus. Enter Caligula solus. Calig. Now pleasured by fit occasion, Poure forth the treasures of thy inward thoughts, Which too too long haue beene imprisoned, Now muse on Romes ensuing miseries, Tiberius treasons, and thy fathers death, Thy brothers danger, and thine owne contempt, And musing, meditate vpon reuenge, Banish harts quiet from thy sleeping thoughts, Vntill thy thoughts be satisfied with blood. Nero I come, inspire me iustest rage: And Rome shall tremble at Caligula. Exit Calig. Enter Seianus, with Nero, and Drusus Germanici. Seian. Nero, Drusus, Drusus, Nero, both are one, Or one or both, for both I know are one: And what I speake to one I speake to both. Nay, heare me out for what I speake is true, Piso did poyson great Germanicus Your father, Neroes sonne and my good Lord, I, by Tiberius pollicie. Lo here the pardon made for Piso drawne, Which Iulia dying did to me commend, What shall I speake to moue you to reuenge, The Senat is deuoted to your stocke, The common people in soft murmuring, Like Bees doe seeke the honie of your Hiues, What if some Waspes doe moue Tiberius? I haue a swarme maugre these lazie droanes: I haue the Legions at Seianus becke, And for my sake, and specially for yours, I know they will euibrate all their force, Besides the honour of your Countries good, Exile the tyrant, so did Cassius, Brutus the elder and the yonger Brute, Honour and fauour, youth and legions, The Senators, and the Plebians: If all may moue you, courage noble hearts; Let Hares and Harts be fearfull in their kinds, Romanes haue valiant and vndaunted minds. Nero. Brother a word with you:â Takes him aside Seia. I, go, consult, whilst I centuriate A thousand nets to catch such tender fooles. Nero. Drusus how dost thou like Seianus gesture? Dru. Faith like his words, for both are counterfet. Nero. Vpon my life Tiberius sent the slaue. Dru. Tis so by Ioue, tis so, looke brother, see How the damn'd villain fleares, &amp; laughs, &amp; lowres Wele first begin with him, &amp; th? for Nero: They begin to draw. Nero. Brother content, and now be resolute, But here comes Iulius Celsus, hold thy hand. Enter Iulius Celsus. Celsus. Flie, flie Seianus, Iulius bids thee flie: Nero hath found thy death in Iuliaes house, I meane, the cause of death, thy trecheries, The letter that thou sent'st to Liuia: Away, shift for thy selfe, and so will I. Exit. Seia. Hath he found that? Seianus cursse thy selfe, The lower world, and the highest heauen. That he hath found them; die, consume, and burne. I heare the noise of horses, they are here, A plague vpon them all, then here away. Exit. Ne. Brother away, t'is time, we may suspect. Exeunt. Seianus lookes in at the doore, and speaketh. Sei. Hell yawne and swallow them: that way I am stopt, This way the dogs wil bark &amp; so betray me: The geese will gaggle, if I flie this way. There are his murderous guard, a hel confound th?: Oh for the seauen-way house of Hannibal! Sejanus kill thy selfe, oh no I dare not, Would I were an Asse to beare: so I am. I am not: I flie, I dare not: I cannot, I must. Exit. Enter Tiberius with his guard pursuing Seianus. Tib. Hast for your liues, seeke, search, enquire, stop stay, Misdoubt, examine, spie, watch, haue a care, And if he passe, not one of you shall scape Th'extreamest torments that I can inflict. Poast poast, away some to the Capitoll, Some to port Esquiline, mount Pallatine, Watch, watch the streetes, the Drusian streetes, Hie to the Altars, the Ãgerian wood: The bridge of Tiber, and Prometheus Lake, Some where, any where, euery where, away, away. Enter Seianus: the guard besets all the doores, he draweth and proffereth to come diuers wayes: at last rusheth on the guard, fighteth, and is taken. Seia. Heauen, earth, hell: helpe, hide, gape: here swallow vp a liuing sacrifice, Grac'd with an Heccatombe of slaughtered slaues, Hold sword Sejanus barters death for death. Ti. So, bind the traitor fast in Iron chaines, Now slaue of honor, ground of Infamie, Obloquies subject, and faire dealings shame, Nay heare me villaine, for thou must, and shalt. Seia. Must, shal, and will, for I am bound to doe it. Tib. I, and to beare what euer I inflict. Sei. Strik quickly, &amp; strike home, I wait the stroke And shall embrace the instrument of death, And neuer grieue to droune it in my blood, So that the streamie spirits that ascend, Were of sufficient force to strangle thee: Tib. Ah good Sejanus how yet I pittie thee! Seia. I craue no pittie, neither feare thy pride, Whose pittie onely serueth for a truce, To leuie new supply of tyrannie. Tib. The man begins to play the Orator, Get him a Throne to grace his eloquence. Seia. This kind of curtesie I will accept. Tib. Yet shall you not perform't except I will: Sei. If, Tygers issue thou shouldst cut out my tung: And rob my thoughts of their Ambassador, The boundlesse Ocean of my swelling thoughts, (Enraged with the malice of my heart) Would ouerflow my breasts immuring bankes, To make relation of thy villanie. Tib. Oh terrible reuenge, intollerable. But I shall vndergoe it as I may, And here and there still as you glaunce at me, But touch a little your owne villainies, And therein play the true Historian. Tut, courage man, why dost thou not begin? Seia. Bidst thou begin, who long will wish me end, Ere I haue ript vp halfe thy villanies: Which neuer will haue end vntill thou end. Oh hadst thou ended ere thou hadst begun, So many euils had not chaunc'd in Rome: Then had not Vestaes Tapers beene defil'd, Nor th'Altars turnd to irreligious vses: When thou didst make her neuer dying lampes, Serue for the Torches to thy burning lust, The whilest her Temple made a brothel-house, And all her virgins prostitute to thee. But these are but thy meanest outrages, Wrought in thy villainous minoritie Thy Cleopatrean cates could scarce disgest, Without a measure daunc'd by naked truls, To feed thy glutton-eyes immodest gaze. Tib. And where was then Sejanus, holy man? Seia. Herein I doe accuse my selfe of guilt. Tib. Beshrew thy hatefull head for doing it. Seia. Bale to thy hatefull heart for causing it. Tib. Thy plotting head for so inuenting it. Seia. Thy bloodie mind for so concluding it. Tib. And on Sejanus for effecting it. Seia. And on Sejanus for effecting it. Yet villaine doe I curse my cursed selfe? Downe poysed by the execrations Of those that thou by me hast murthered? Tib. Beleeue him sirs, may be he speaketh truth. Seia. It may be tyrant, nay it is too true. Caius, and Lucius, were murthered, And Agripina, by Tiberius. So poysoned Germanicus was slaine. Sabinus, and Asinius were dispatch'd, And Iulia for her sonne Tiberius. And so thou louedst Drusus thine owne sonne; To sucke his bloud in whose death still I ioy, To thinke that therein I ore-reach'd a tyrant. Poore Prince vniustly doom'd to suddaine death, Which in his life he onely this deseru'd By giuing me a whirret on the eare: But as for treasons ignominious spot against thy selfe, thy life or Diademe, His innocent thoughts neuer were tainted with. Ti. Hold hart, break not betwixt my rage &amp; griefe Aside. Seia. Onely for this. Tib. Onely for this! O furie teach my tongue, To breath eternall curses on his soule. Seia. O how I triumph in soule-pleasing ioy, That herein yet I die not vnreueng'd. I made him die for mine owne proper fault, For know Tiberius as in all the rest, So in thy Sonne Drusus sad Tragedie, I grounded the foundation of my hopes, Meaning vpon the Ocean of their blouds, To swim vnto the Throne of Maiestie, And from thy hand rend the imperiall crowne. Tib. Here is the Catalogue of his deserts, Tis pittie but he were an Emperour. Spuriusâ He whispers in his eare, &amp; Exit Spurius Make haste, I charge thee on thy life. Herein I must detract from pollicie, And Fortune attribute the cause to thee, That thus I may reuenge this treacherie. Seia. Reuenge! alas thou maist perhaps on me, Inflict th'extreamitie of punishment, And rid thee so of one peece of thy feare, But yet thou canst not scape deserued death, For from the PhÅnix ashes of their Sire, The heart reuiued young Germanici. Wife Nero, and fierce Drusus arm'd with rage, Come like a lightning to consume thy state. Tiber. Soldiers pursue them ere they passe the walles To ioyne themselues vnto the Legions. Seia. Why lunaticke Vsurper of the Crowne, They are the lawfull heires vnto the state, Thou but adopted by false treacherie, My right as good as thine is to the Crowne, For both but false, and both but villanie. Tibe. Thou doost me wrong Sejanus to vpbraid me thus With Ignominious Title of ingrate. Or wrong detaining what is not mine owne. Enter Spurius with a burning Crowne. Who, I Vsurpe your Crowne and your estate? I were not fit to liue and if I should. Therefore my Maisters, heere before you all, I doe resigne my crowne imperiall Vnto Sejanus, and doe inuest him CÃ¦sar, He sets the burning Crowne vpon his head. All haile Sejanus, Romes great Emperour. Seia. Al haile: Hell, Death, Destruction plague you al Let all the tortures, torments, punishments. In earth, in heauen, in hell, reuenge my death, Whose burning paine torments me not so much as that there comes not from my scalded braines, Sufficient smoake to smother all of you. He dyes. Tibe. So dye thy Cursses with thy cursed selfe, Now one goe cast, his bodye in to Tiber, The rest goe with me, tis high time to hast. Exeunt. omnes Enter Agripina sola. Agr. Oh heauens! and if that any power be higher! O earth! and if that any lower lye? Melt heauens into a showre of supple balme. Flower earth, all purpled with Nepenthaes leaues, Too foolish Agripina to complaine, Earth, Heauens, Nepenthaes balme, and al in vaine. This earthly hart, it is my pleasing earth. She openeth the box with the heart of Germanicus This is Nepenthaes that doth cure annoy: This balme, this Cassia, this is sweetest Myrrhe When I forget to ioy in this respect, Heau?, Earth, Nepenthaes all do me neglect O what a dungeon is this tabernacle! To whome, and when, and where shall I complaine? I know not, and againe I knowe, For Agripina is amaz'd with woe. Enter Marco. Macr. Madam, Tiberius CÃ¦sars maiestie, Sent me to tell you of his neare approach. Agri. Wil Nero come? where are his torturs then? His rod, his Hatchets, Rackes, gyues, manacles, Whips, Gridir?s, Tumbrels, Lyons, Tygers, beares And all his vnquoth new found Messengers, Which bloody Phallaris could nere inuent? Can faire Pallantias leaue her Lucifer, Or PhÅbus shine, and not Aurora rise? Tush you are much deceiu'd, Nero will not come. Macro. Lady, my heart doth yearne to here your griefe, To surge in billowes of such bitter waues. Andâ Agr. And what? good Gentleman, tel out the rest: What, will you set a ship vpon my Sea, Fraught with a thousand Tunne of heauie cares, And with a sharpe tempestious Romaine winde, Saile vnto Thule or the frozen maine, Then glide vppon the yce and so to land, And sowe these seedes of care twixt bankes of Rue, Deepe delu'd, and deepe rooted in colde clay, Then in pursuing of this faintie soyle, Stay vntill haruest, and in Autumne sheare This fruitefull Corne, and so returne againe. But Agripina, these fond humors leaue, Macro, my griefe my sences halfe bereaue. Macr. True Agripina, Macro much did wonder, The variable passions of sad sorrow, That I lament the tragicke historie, This dolefull faultering Engine should impart, Nero will hether come vnder pretext, To comfort, but to trie your patience. He hath an Apple in such sirrop dipt, Which he in kindenes meanes to offer you: If you accept, accept a present death: If you denie, heele take exceptions, Against your faith, and subiects loyaltie. Dreadfull Dilemma, counsell as you may. I doubt that Nero wil misdoubt my stay. Exit Macr. Agri. Dares he not stay? O monstrous periurie! Did he not vow by Ioues eternall Crowne? By Saturnes sighe, and Venus golden belt? Mercuries changing rod and Lunaes Horne, That he would stay with me. O periury! Nero make hast: yet stay, ile paire my Nailes, Least that I set my tallents on his face, And spoile Narcissus comely personage. He will giue me an Aple, ile giue himâ A what? a Lemmon: no but ile giue him A Chesnut, and heele cracke the riuen shell, And twixt his Milstones, grinde the yealding meat Germanicus, oh my Drusus! oh my Deare, Nero, no! Nero CÃ¦sar will visite me, And feede me fat with Capons and with Quailes. Quailes! noe with Apples so he comes: I shall be cram'd today. Enter Tiberius with his attendants Spurius &amp; Nerua, Macro and Caligula following after. Tiber. Faire Daughter Agripina, you doe wrong That spotlesse beautie with congealed teares. Blotting those Rubies with dissolued pearles, Stayning those Roses with such Christal streames. Is not the world subject to Romaine power? And thou the Daughter of the Emperour, And so th'imperiall Mistresse of the world? Then Agripina but commaund the world? and all the world shall seeke to comfort thee. Agri. Nero, not all the world can comfort me, Since all the world hath lost my comforter. Tiber. Hath all the world? what did your Lord aspire? Daughter, you cannot rule vnlesse you raigne. Agr. Blush not deare Ensigne of my modestie, Shame light on me if that I be asham'd, Since thou wilt neuer be asham'd of shame, My Lord Germanicus did he aspire? No Nero no, there lurkes the fistila Of fawning hatred that did murther him. Did he not honour Rome in Germany? Did he not homage to Tiberius? Did he not loue his countrie past compare? Courteous and milde, and too obsequious? Too well beloued and too credulous? and therefore murthered. Tiber. Nay stay a while, And breath, and raile, and raile and breath againe, and then I hope your Ladyship will stay, Meanewhile, hold, heeres an apple to refresh The dryed vapours of your fuming head. Eate it and breath, eate it and raile againe, Doe so faire Daughter to allay your paine. Words ease the stomacke. Agrip. So must they mine: Or else my heart would breake in vile dispite. Monster of Monsters, ill is too too good, Cruel, too milde a title for thy deedes: Nature could neuer finde a man so bad, That might resemble thy foule Villanies. Toade, Crockadile, Aspe, Viper, Basiliske, Too holsome, tame, milde, gentle, vertuous, For Neroes poyson, furie, enuy, wrath. Tibe. Woman, I listen much vnto thy Taunts, Yet know that I haue Pandaturia, There, babble to the wind, thy foolish moanes, There in some desart make thy Elegies, Tune them vnto the puling harmony, Of the lamenting consort bred in Thrace: Rome shall not heare thy yelling execrations, Before Enos shall foure times be washt, In Nereus fountaine with Hiperion, Vpon thy life see that thou see not Rome, But banisht, backe to pandaturia. Agri. First let the head of Nilus be reueal'd, Let Tiber flowe in Ãgipt, Nile in Rome, Let earth to ayre, and water turne to fire, All to confusion, let heauen turne to hell, And which is more and most Prodigious, Let Nero thinke one thought of honestie, If Agripina yeeld to bannishment. Did not Sejanus blazen all thy wrongs, That all the world doth loath thy treacheries? Did not the Parthian King admonish thee? Thou wert a villaine, and thou sworst twas true, Doth not each night with dreames of thy foule sins Torment thy soule with gastly Spectacles? Cajus, Lucius, Augustus, Iulia, Sejanus, and my Lord Germanicus, Solicite Pluto for thy deepe reuenge? They doe, they doe, and all the furies shake There new filde yron whips for their reuenge. If there be heauen, be sure of Nemesis: If there be hell be sure to be tormented, With balefull tortors neuer yet inuented. Tibe. Not all this while, good Daughter out of breath? Wel, speake thy last, that Rome shal here thee prate Agr. My last fond Tyrant know that I wil speake In spite of Nero, in disdaine of Rome, Nero the Butcher, bloody shambles Rome, Who sells the fayrest ware at meanest price. Tibe. I, and because peeuish wilfull griefe, Hath made you somewhat leane, not fit for sale, You shall to grasse to Pandaturia: Prouide her hay and water store enough. Agrip. No, no, what shall I call this hate of earth? Ile call him Nero, thats the worst of all. Nero, it shall not neede, I am prouided Of fairer Cates without thy honest care, The corne that makes my bread are yellow cares, Ripened by heate of anger, in my breast, The barren field of nought but carefull seedes. My meate the sodden sorrowes of my heart, Which boile with soft remembrance of my woes, And if I play the Epicure in griefe, My teares shall be the sence of my repasts. If euer other foode my tongue doe taste: I euer other foode my stomacke doe concockt: Let all be turn'd from sustentation, To fill impostumes with contagious filth. I tell thee Nero, Agripine will die, And starue herselfe, and scorne thy banishment. Tis two daies since I last did taste of meate, Curst be my soule, if euer I doe eate. Tibe. Will you not? see, sirra, go fetch some foode Ile make thee cursse thy selfe: hold, take, fall too. Agri. Detested tyrant, I do scorne thy foode. Tib. Then helpe Sirra, ope her mouth &amp; feede her, Cut her meate small, and feede her daintily. Agr. Out villaine. He feedeth her, and she putteth it out againe Tibe. Sirra dispatch I say. Nay, cram her then, &amp; feede her fat withall. He choaketh her and so she dies. What hast thou strangled her? here take thy hyre. Canst thou not feed a Daw no better yet? Stabs him. Neru. Ah, Nero, Nero. Tib. What Nerua be content, She chose of this rather then banishment: And better choake then starue our wilful daughter, Shee's gone, and if I liue thou shalt goe after. Aside. Exeunt all but Macro and Caligula. Macro. Barbarous, inhumane, worse then crueltie, Which Gods and men, mine eyes, and soule, do hate, What Hyporborian Climate in the North? What Lidian desart, Indian vastacie? What wildernesse in wilde Arabia, So hatefull monster euer nourished, To hinder willing death by villanie? Caligula, Changeling Caligula, Where is the Spirit of Germanicus? Did he beget thee in an idle dreame? Or did thy Mother thinke it vanitie As Ãthiops Queene vpon Andromeda? If but one sparke by chance remaine aliue, If but one drop, one Mathematicke point, Make vp a Sea, a bodie by addition, Blow vp (Caligula) this sleepie sparke, Caligula remember what thou art. Calig. Macro, Caligula can beare thy taunts, Can be vpbraided at a Captaines hand, My Father told me, and I remember it, The highest vertue is true patience. I know not what you meane by all these wordes, That mount my Fathers prayses to the skie, To liue securely, I deeme that the best, And a great vertue to be patient. Macro. Patient Caligula, I am asham'd, I am impatient to heare that word, That noble Title wrested from his sence, Ah! did not Macro serue Germanicus When as thy Mother bare thee in the field? Did not a peale of Trumpets sound thy birth? And Drums make musicke to allay hir paines? Wast thou not train'd fore thou couldst speake, Didst thou not were a Common Soldiers sute? And therefore hadst thy name Caligula? Where is thy Captiue soule imprisoned? Thy Lyons heart? incag'd! no, thou art wise, Thou deem'st that Nero hath suborn'd my tongue, To make a glozing Theame of flatterie, To sift thy secrets, and to sell thy life, First let the earth open her curssed wombe, and swallow vp this hellish mantion. Let euerie step treade on a Scorpion: Let euerie object be a Bassaliske: Let heauenâwhat can I wish Caligula? Here is my poynard: here, be sure strike home, If thou canst haue but least suspition That Macro seekes to vndermine my Lord. What? shall I now become a Sycophant? Cali. Macro, Caligula doth not mistrust, Nor hath he reason to misdoubt thy faith, But Macro, thus much for Caligula: Meete me at Fides Temple, there thou shalt know More, then vnto my mother I durst shew. Macro. Were it to Thale, I would thether poast, To heare the sentence of Caligula, Till then my Lord adiew. Calig. Farwel Macro. Exit Macro. My Father slaine or poysoned in the East, Liuia become a foule adulteresse. Nero and Drusus fast shut vp inward, and thou deere mother heere lyest butchered. Grow to the earth you feeble instruments. He kneels downe. Till I distill a liquid sacrifice From my harts fornance, &amp; these Christal streames. Ye dry'd vp wels, straine out a little more, Tis Agripina that you must deplore. Proud Spirit, bound thy swelling Timpanie, Till I vnfraught this Galley of laments. Then cleare thy passage, and burst out in fire, and make an Earthquake in this little world. What shall I vow? to whome shall I lament? Vnto the Marbles? they doe weepe for sorrow. Vnto the Walles? thy riue themselues with griefe. Vnto the Beasts? why they would starue themselues To feede themselues vpon this fading hew. Marbles and Walles, and beastes more ruth then he, That was the Author of this Tragedie. He takes her in his armes and goes in. Ãneas burthen neuer was so deare, As this celestiall burthen which I beare. Exit. Nero and Drusus chained in prison. Dru. Brother I faint, and now my starued soule, Seekes for to feed vpon Ambrosia Nero. Dear Drusius, wold mine armes were but vnchain'd That thou mightst stanch thy hunger on my flesh: My colder humors feed my gnawing heat, That I can better yet endure the fast. See brother I thinke thou maist reach mine arme, I pray thee feed vpon this leane repast. Dru. No brother if it would prolong my life, Till the great yeare when al things must be chang'd To the Idea of the formers will. But if thy hungry woolfe doe vexe thy soule, Feed on these cates, taste on this brawnie arme, That will reioyce to feede thy appetite. Nero. Nay brother feed on mine They eate each others armes. Dru. Nay brother mine. Enter Caligula againe. Cal. Boast not Antigone of thy deare loue. To Polinices thy affected brother, Whom thou in sight of Creon didst entombe, I haue entomb'd a farre more precious Iewell, I in dispite of Nero farre more cruell. Dru. Ah, Nero, Nero, that dost vs enforce, To be such louing Romane Canibals, Cal. Who calles on Nero, wast my mothers ghost? Nero. Ah cruell CÃ¦sar, brother forgiue, forgiue, My food digesteth not, nor can I liue. Cal. Or am I blind, or doe mine eyes behold, My starued brothers? tis so Caligula. Nero. Brother farewell my glasse of life is run. Dru. And Ile go with thee to Elizium. They both die Cal. Is there a prouident intelligence? That rules the world by his eternall being? Is there a Ioue? and will he not be just? Or is he iust? and will he not reuenge? What is he? whom, or where, or who can tell? Canst thou not moue the heauens? then raise vp hell. Exit Caligula. Enter Tiberius with his guard. Tib. Cocceius Nerua staru'd himselfe to death, I wonder much what made the old man die, In truth I lou'd him for his naked truth, In truth he was an honest simple man. Well vertue go with him, vice stay with me, Till I haue massacred my prisoners, And rooted out all this conspiracie: Then will I seeme a new reformed man, And rise betimes each morning to the Temple, So afterwards I may contriue some drifts. I haue a Catalogue which I must finde, And search the prisons whether I haue all. Iulius, Celsus crieth out of prison. Cel. Ah, Nero, Nero, Celsus begs thine ayde, Tib. Iulius Celsus what is thy petition? Cel. An humble sutor for your clemencie. Tib. My clemencie Celsus, Marie and you shall, I, and great reason for Seianus sake. Cel. Not in his name I beg compassion, But by thy vertues I doe thee intreat, ah gracious Nero let my Guiues be loos'd. Tib. And Celsus led to execution. Cel. Ah, no Tiberius, I desire not death, But better ease in my imprisonment, For this I beg. Tib. For whose sake Iulius? Cels. For mercies sake, and thy deare Geneus. Tib. For that word Iailer loose his Iron bands, Or by my Geneus thou shalt loose thy head, Cels. O voice of comfort, thanks Tiberius. Tib. Tis but for a while, know that Iulius. Celsus. Now monster, Tyger, earthes infection, Plague of the world, scourge of our happie Rome, Treasons first borne, hels out-spewed vommit, Prodigious homicide, and murthers lawe, That makes a sporting lawe to murther men. Tibe. Holla and breathe, and then beginne again, Nero shall recompence thee for thy paine. Celsus Such Recompence had good Germanicus, Such Agripina, such had Iulia: Such Nero, Drusus, and their dearest Mother, Poore Agripina, wise Asinius: Sabinus, Nerua, and thy other selfe, Young Drusus, whose deare blood was once thine owne Yet of thine owne hadst no compassion. And lastly, (though not vndeseruing it) Yet heerein well deseruing at thy hands, In that he was thy mischiefes instrument: Haplesse Sejanus too improuident, Of his intended fall, thy false intent. And such a recompence remaines for me, The meanest subject of thy Tryannie. Tibe. Marie amen, sweare it, an Oracle: Celsus. But tyrant, Celsus doth contemne thy furie My minde was neuer feuer-shooke with feare Of Meagre death, lifes due priuation, I haue alreadie arm'd my age to die, Whose age deemes death the end of miserie. See therefore Tyger, heeres thy mercies fruite, The ease I sought, the end of earnest suite. For this I beg'd, for this I seem'd vnwilling, For to be dead, that I might gaine my killing. He puts the Chaine about his necke and strangles himself. Tiber. Wondrous well gain'd, here is good vsury, Where tis the gainers interest to die: But Oh for Charitie! Iayler, Soldiers run, Rescue his life, before his life be gone. Yet let him goe. Iailer What is your highnesse will? Tib. Nay nothing now but that as yon man dies, For Charitie close vp his dying eyes. Why this it is to haue a pollicie, Here's a poore plot to preuent crueltie, And ten to one the villaine vnderstands. How this will vexe me that he scapes my hands. But let that passe leaue him to Acheron, His part is past, part of my part's to come. Exeunt omnes. Enter Caligula and Macro from Fides Temple. Cal. Thus haue we interchang'd our mutuall othes In presence of the Goddesse of all truth: Macro remember how thou art inioyn'd, By words, by signes, by letters and by thoughts, For to adore eternall secrecie. Macro. And if my Lord misdoubt my secrecie, Cut out my tongue, cut off my traitors hands, Vnioynt my bodie, and pull out my heart, That I may neither tell, nor make a signe, Nor thinke one thought against your royaltie. Cal. Pardon me Macro, if I somewhat feare, That hauing all this while securely slept, Vnder the Canopie of vanitie, And neuer did impart my secrecie, To father, mother, or my brethren: Nerua, Sabinus, or Asinius: Nero, Seianus, all I haue deceiued; Vnder pretext of youthfull brauerie. But Macro, to thy youth I recommend, The supreame relique of Germanicus. by Agripinaes loathed execution, By my deare brothers starued carkasses, By thee, by me, by all the gods, by all: And if that any number be, more then all. Ioyne to exile this proud Tarquinius, Insulting Nero: no not so, not so: Yes so it must be, or else murthered, For nought but death can satisfie my wrongs. Macro. Like as a Grayhound in his hot pursuite, Striues to out-strip the fearfull flying Doe, Or as Dianaes gift to Cephalus, yearn'd to out-run the beast of Archadie, Both striuing, yet both swifter then the blasts, Disdaine Boreas in his swelling pride, Shot for the sister of faire Dianire: So doth the honour of your houering thoughts, Grudge to be equall'd by my fluttering flight, Yet good my Lord giue Macro leaue to mount, And ceaze vpon the accosting stooping pray. Cal. Not so, I (Macro) tis that haue the wrong. Macro. But I my Lord,â Cal. Do not intreat, Doe not prolong with idle breathing words, The date of cold reuenge: for euen this night, Nero shall be inroll'd in Plutoes Court, In Germanie farre on the Northren side, Within the circuit of a desart wood, A wildernesse of deadly Basilisks, Within this circuit is an hellish poole, Cold in the tenth degree. Not Stix so cold, Wherein the fearefull Thetis drencht her sonne. In a Mules hoofe this water haue I kept, As fatall drinke to Philips worthie sonne, And euen this night this water shall reuenge, The Tyrants wrongs vnto Caligula, Macro flie vnto the Legions, win their hearts, Perswade with all thy warlike eloquence, Aduaunce our Eagles, and to morrow morne Approach with them vnto the Capitol, Faile not good Macro, but make hast away, This night for Nero or Caligula. Enter Liuia Sola. Liuia. Can Liuia still participate this ayre? Still temporize with fawning miserie? Still feed on cares, yet still vaine hopes repaire? Will nothing end my cruell destinie? What lumpish Saturne did inspire my breath, Did make me die in life, yet liue in death? Breath out thy plaints, with all breath out thy hart Euaporate the spirits of thy soule, Weepe out thy braine the substance of thy smart, That knew thy shame, yet would not sin controule, Anatomize this Sepulchre of shame, Soule, hart, and braine, and all, and all to blame. Is Drusus dead? and yet can Liuia liue? Sejanus at Elizium, and I stay? My father murthered? who me life can giue? My brothers staru'd? Liuia not made away? Old Heccuba by death could ease her griefe, And cannot Liuia find out like reliefe? Can I that flourished like fairest Rose, Droope like the Lillie beaten downe with raine? Can I to whom each courtiers tongue would glose, Endure their scornes, their taunts and vile disdaine? Could Liuia liue, when Liuia was contented? And cannot Liuia die now shees tormented? She kneeles downe by the Welles side. Great Faunus to whose sacred Deitie, This sanctified groue is consecrate: Accept the incense of my last pietie, The best deuotion I can dedicate: Accept great Faunus this my dying proffer: Many more great, none more sincere can offer. Not Dido to Sicheus sacrifice, Nor Cleopatra vnto Anthonie: Nor great Olympias could this truce dispise, Nor Sophonisbaes loyall miserie: Zenobia, Palmicaes noble Queene, This fatall end of Liuia might be seeme. Faire fountaine cleare the blots of infamie, Cold streames, congeale the rumour of my death, Thou onely Philomela sing my Tragedie, Carroll a Dirge for my exhaled breath: Faire streames I come, let no man heare my cries, Let no man shed one teare that Liuia dies. Here she leapeth in. Enter Caligula solus. Cal. By this, the cruel Tarquine should be sped, Banisht from Rome and Romane Emperie, But much I feare, preseruatiues doe stay The furie of his waterie receipt, And Macro may be trecherous: what a foole Was I for to impart my secrecie? O what a villaine was Caligula? Horror confounds me in this Agonie: But Ile Catastrophize this Tragedie. Did not the villaine sweare, and vow, and weepe, Offer his breast, that I might make a window To see the cankers of his festred soule, And thou wouldest not take him at his word? Enter Macro. Macro. My Lord, the legions are all vp in armes, For to salute your grace the Emperour. Cali. Thankes Macro, royall friend commaund them stay, Till I returne from Nero back againe. Exit Macro. Caligula goeth to the place where Nero Tiberius lyeth sicke, and pulleth aside the Arras. Caligula. All happinesse vnto your Majestie. Tibe. Curst be all happinesse, for I haue none. I haue a fire, a fire within my bowells, That burnes, and scalds, and mads me with the pain: If I must die, yet would I had my wish, Oh that euen all the people in the world, Had but one necke that at one deadly blowe, I might vnpeople all the world and die. Giue me my hands that I may rent my flesh, And teare this raging from out my burning intralls Where is Ãsculapius? who goes for him? Ile hale the leach from hell to cure my paine, And if that Nero doe not quickly mend, Ile burne euen all the Temples of the Gods, That cannot help the Romaine Emperour. Calig. Yes, I will helpe the Romaine Emperour, and be reueng'd on thee Tiberius, Thou monster Tyrant, thus ile help thee thus: Hee stops his breath with the sheete, and stabs him. This for Germanicus, this for Agripine, This for Nero, this for Drusus, this for Caligula, So,â Reenters vpon the Stage. There Nero, the hate of Rome lies butchered, He raign'd noe day, but some were murthered, Asking his Maister Zeno a Greeke word, What Dialect? he answered Dorice, And therefore kild him, for because he thought He mockt him for his Rhodian bannishment. He loathd wine now, because he swilled goare: More greedily then he did wine before. He slue a Poet for this little cause, Because that in a dolefull Tragedie, Hee rail'd on Agamemnons crueltie. It is a holy law, and Romaine rite, No vestall Virgin should be strangled, He for to inuent a crueltie, Made first the hang-man to deflowre the Maides. And then commaunded for to strangle them. When one had almost kild himselfe for feare, He made his Surgions for to cure his woundes. The tyrant would deny no Witnesses, If any did accuse twas present death. When first the Tyrant did possesse the Crowne. He sent to Rhodes, for a deare friend of his, Who cherrisht Nero in his banishment. He comming vnto Rome, found out the Prince, But in an angrie, sullen, discontent: Who in a rage made him be tortured: And wh? the villain saw he had wrong'd his friend He murthered him, that it might be conceald. He crucified one Peter cald a Saint, Of holy Iewes, that did adore one Christ, Which they entitle Sauiour of the world. He kil'd one Pryam (there in happy most, In that he liued and all his Cuildren lost.) These and so many more as should I tell, I should imploy a world to number them, And still be further with Simonides, To signifie the certaine multitude. By these his acts ile iustifie his death, That I may get Romes royall Empiry, And to eternall glorie of renowne, I was a foole, but all to get the Crowne. FJNIS.</field>
