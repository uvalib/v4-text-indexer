      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —Hall in the Castle of the Duchess Grognon—Hunting music heard. Enter Domestics. Chorus—“Bright Chanticleer.” Bright chanticleer proclaims the dawn, And hark, that distant horn; The king he is a hunting gone, As sure as you are born. Come let us to the windows throng, Of hounds I hear the cry, I'll wager, boys, it won't be long, Before the king comes by. With a hey, ho, chivy! Hark forward! hark forward! tantivy, &amp;c. Enter Grognon. Grog. How now, ye knaves! what's all this noise about? But. An't please your grace, the royal hounds is out. Grog. Is 'em! and pray what follows, Ignoramus? But. What follows? why the King Grog. The King! that's famous! The King, you booby, keeps his room—his bed, Weeping a wife who has been three years dead. Who ever heard of such preposterous grief? Her money died with her, 'tis my belief, Or he'd have left off mourning long before; Not that he loved her less, but loves gold more. Meanwhile, his ugly daughter rules the roast. But. Ugly! her Royal Highness is the toast Of all the beaux! Groom. The fairest of the fair! Grog. (striking them) Ye lying knaves, take that, and that—dost dare To contradict me? Graciosa! stuff! A toast she may be, for she's brown enough, And some court fools with such fine words may butter her; But any slave of mine, who shall be utterer Of such vile falsehoods, on the rack shall linger! There is more beauty in my little finger Than Graciosa has in her whole body. Enter Page, followed by Lord Nimroddy. Page. His Majesty's Grand Huntsman, Lord Nimroddy. Grog. My lord— Lord N. Your grace's most devoted. Grog. Pray Be seated. Lord N. Pardon me, I come to say, The King, whilst riding through your grace's park Benignly condescended to remark The sun was most insufferably hot; And seeing o'er the trees a chimney pot, Sagaciously conceived a roof was nigh, And soon this castle caught his piercing eye; Whereon he honoured me with his commands To kiss your grace's most illustrious hands, And tell you that his Majesty will deign To visit you, with all his noble train! Grog. The King abroad again! O, tidings glorious! Again I shall behold the great Uxorious. What changed our sovereign to these blest conditions? Lord N. The last opinion of his nine physicians. For nine long days they've been in consultation, And came at length to the determination The danger of a broken heart to check, By giving him a chance to break his neck; So grief for his lost wife in hopes to smother, They recommend hunting— Grog. (aside) For another? Gigantic thought! He shall not need hunt far. (aloud) What, ho! there! Idle rascals as you are! Fling wide the castle gates, than lightning faster, I fly, my lord, to meet our royal master. (Exeunt Grognon, &amp;c.—Flourish of trumpets) Re-enter Grognon, with the King, attended. March and Chorus—“Evelyn's Bower.” O joy to the hour When to this ancient tower The great King Uxorious came, came, came! His presence so bright, overpowers us quite. King. The sun has served me much the same, same, same. Chorus. Then the sun has been vastly to blame, blame, blame. Grog. How has your servant e'er deserved the honour Your Majesty is pleased to heap upon her? King. Don't mention it! We're glad to see your grace Looking in such remarkable good case. (aside) For, sooth to say, the case is very fair. Grog. Will't please your Majesty to take a chair? King. Yes, and a drop of something cool to drink. Grog. I wonder what your Majesty would think Of some champagne? King. If long enough in ice My Majesty would think it very nice! She signs to Butler and Page, who go out and re-enter, the first with cellar key, and the other with a salver, on which are three goblets. Grog. Mine's in the wood still, but so cold my cellar It needs no ice. Canary, Calcavella, Malmsey, Tokay, Hock, Burgundy, whate'er Your Majesty prefers, you'll find it there. King. Frankly I tell you I prefer champagne. Grog. To turn your royal eyes this way, sir, deign; Here's my small stock of wine. Music—The Butler unlocks a large pair of folding doors, at the back of stage, and discovers the interior of a vaulted cellar filled with large wine barrels—a gold hammer upon the top of one of them. King. Small! goodness gracious! No wine vaults in the world are half so spacious Or so well filled; that is if all those pipes Are really full of wine, and not of swipes. Grog. We'll set that question quickly, sire, at rest; I'll tap this golden sherry as a test. Music—She strikes the cask three times with the hammer— The bung flies out, and guineas and other gold coin flow into a goblet held by the Page—The Butler replaces bung hastily. King. Golden, indeed! why these are guineas, madam! Grog. Dear me! I'd quite forgotten that I had 'em! King. Sure this must be some coinage of the brain. Grog. No, 'tis the current coinage of your reign. King. And all full weight. (aside) Had I my will, good lack, Wouldn't I turn that sherry into sack! Grog. (aside) The King is smitten—and secure my game is— King. My thirst increases. (aside) “Auri sacra fames!” Grog. It's some mistake; this Burgundy we'll try. Music—Taps another cask, and rubies and pearls flow out; same business by Page and Butler. King. Rubies and pearls! my throat gets very dry! Grog. Provoking! who has tamper'd with my wine! King. I wish somebody tamper'd so with mine. (aside) Had I that precious barrel in my clutch, I don't think I could take a drop too much. Grog. But you preferred champagne, sire; there should be Some very sparkling here! Music—Taps third cask, and diamonds come out. King. What do I see? Diamonds, or I'm a Dutchman! Grog. I protest Most gracious sire, that I am quite distress'd. King. Distress'd! and mistress of this mighty treasure? Grog, Indeed, it vexes me beyond all measure, That I can only offer you this trash Instead of a cool draught. King. Draught! if you'd cash. The draught I'd draw upon you— Grog. With delight,— On one condition! King. Name it. Grog. Honour bright? King. Whate'er it be, I swear to grant it, Duchess; For such reward no service sure too much is! Grog. Make me your queen! King. To-day,—this very minute! Grog. There is my hand, sire, and the key is in it. Trio and Chorus—“I should like to marry.” King. (aside) I should like to marry Two, if I could find Another so exactly Suited to my mind. Once, misled by passion, I made a compact rash, But, in wiser fashion, I now compound for cash. Grog. (aside) I at length shall marry, Since I've chanced to find A husband so exactly Suited to my mind, Gold his ruling passion, Mine, to make a splash! Let me lead the fashion, He may keep the cash! Lord N. I believe he'd marry Three, if he could find As many so exactly Suited to his mind. Gold's his ruling passion, Her's to make a splash. She will lead the fashion. He will keep the cash! (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —The Palace Gardens. Enter Graciosa. Air—“The Redowa Polka.” Charming polka—Redowa polka! Pink of polkas thou'rt to me! Still in fancy here I can see Cerito's fairy toes dancing thee! Very fade is now the gallopade: Ungenteel becomes the dull quadrille; Full of faults appears the giddy waltz; Patronised the polka now alone should be! Gaily twirling—lightly whirling— Toeing, heeling—full of grace and feeling; Stupid folk, who cannot polk, Alone will dare, my darling dance, to rail at thee! Enter King. Gra. My royal father, welcome back to court; I trust your Majesty has had good sport. King. Famous! I found in a preserve to-day, Where, nestled snug, a golden pheasant lay. Gra. Was it alive? King. It was! Gra. Inhuman sire, How could you on the pretty creature fire? King. I wasn't so inhuman. Gra. Did you not? King. No! yet I brought my bird down at one shot. Gra. Your Majesty is pleased to be most pleasant. King. 'Tis living still. Gra. Then make it, sire, a present To me, and I will of it take such care. King. Nay! 'tis a bird of plumage far too rare To trust in hands like yours. I mean to pluck— Gra. And roast it? King. No, 'tis ready drest, my duck. Gra. Nay; now you're roasting me. King. Well, truth to say, The golden pheasant I have caught to-day Is a fair lady—rich as fifty Jews! Gra. (aside) Oh, my prophetic soul! My mother's shoes Some one would stand in. (aloud) Tell me, sir, her name! King. The Duchess Grognon! Gra. You are making game Of her indeed! A pheasant! that old fright? A screech owl! raven! vulture! King. Be polite, For know that lady I am pledged to marry, And marry her I will, by the Lord Harry! Therefore, respect your step-mother. Gra. Oh rather Kill me, than in that course take one step farther. She hates me mortally! King. She loves me dearly! Gra. She's near threescore! King. She has threescore millions yearly! Gra. She's but one eye! King. She's worth a Jew's eye, girl! Gra. Red hair—black teeth! King. Fine rubies! rows of pearl! Gra. Lame of one leg, and with one shoulder humpy! King. A lump of gold, and plenty of the stumpy! So, taisez vous, and quick prepare to meet her. (Exit) Gra. I am a most unfortunate young creature! Ah, me! when will my sorrows have an end? I have not now, on earth, a single friend! Music—Percinet appears amongst the trees. Per. I am your friend, and single, matchless fair. Gra. A strange young man! however came he there? Who are you, sir? I don't know you from Adam! Per. I am your very humble servant, madam, Your page, your groom, or anything you please. Gra. What business has a page amongst these trees? Per. To find a page, amongst the leaves one looks, And I would be a page in your good books. Gra. But you are not one of my father's pages! Per. No, I am yours alone— Gra. And at what wages? Per. Wages! I serve for love and not for money, Pay me in smiles and kisses, sweet as honey. Gra. Kisses! Why, you audacious little varlet, I kiss a page! my cheeks must sure be scarlet. Have you forgot the distance, sir, between us? Per. We soon can lessen that, my little Venus. Here at your feet, my passion I declare— Gra. Your passion, sirrah page! of mine beware! I'm a king's daughter! Princess Graciosa! Per. And I am a king's son. Gra. You don't say so, sir. A prince! in this disguise! oh, how romantic! Per. One who with love for you has long been frantic; Yet, who had still in silence nursed his flame But for your danger— Gra. Dear sir, what's your name? Per. 'Tis Percinet! My mother is a fairy. Gra. A very useful friend in a quandary. Per. I practise, too, a little in that line, So pray command whatever power is mine. Gra. I'm flatter'd by this proof of your affection, And feel I may rely on your protection. Somebody's coming; if thus caught together— Per. Fear nothing; I but turn my cap and feather And I'm invisible! Gra. Oh, prince delusive! Where are you? Per. Here. (kisses her) Gra. The proof is quite conclusive. Enter Nimbletongue hastily. Nim. Madam, the new-elected Queen is near. Gra. My hateful stepmother! I sink with fear. Nim. She's the astonishment of all beholders, Much padding has made even her odd shoulders; A high-heeled shoe keeps her game leg from sinking, A new glass eye rolls in her head like winking. She's bought a set of teeth might even you fit, And a black wig, that quite out-truefits Truefit. The bells are ringing, and the guns are roaring And citizens are out to meet her pouring; And I'm commanded by your sire, the King, To beg you'll haste, and do the civil thing! Gra. I come. Nim. I go. (Exit) Per. My horse is at your service. The tree opens and discovers a horse richly caparisoned, and attended by two Arabian grooms. Gra. Oh, dear, I couldn't, I'm so very nervous. Per. A true Arabian, the wild desert's ranger! Mount! whilst I run beside you there's no danger, But if I left him by himself to prance, I wouldn't give much for his rider's chance! Gra. But I could never get a horse outside! Per. Fear not, nor you, nor he shall go a stride. My Arab grooms shall hold him by the head, And all the road shall run and trot instead! Duo—“O give me but my Arab steed”—Percinet and Graciosa. Per. I give to you my Arab steed, My Princess fair and bright, And him I'll by the bridle lead, And keep you right and tight; Your colours I will proudly wear, And gird your scarf around, But we have now no time to spare, For hark! the trumpets sound! So mount upon my Arab steed, My Princess fair and bright, And him I'll by the bridle lead, And keep you right and tight. Gra. Upon your Arab steed I go, And cease to sob and sigh; My sovereign father weds my foe, But not a fig care I. Good manners will my conduct sway, Of course when Queen she's crown'd, So I my duty haste to pay, For hark! the trumpets sound! Both. So on your Arab steed I go, &amp;c. Then mount upon my Arab steed, &amp;c. Graciosa mounts horse, Percinet holds the bridle—Scene moves, and they appear to issue through gate of the Palace into the open country—The high road lined with People, Guards, &amp;c., is seen with the city in the distance—The King and the Duchess Grognon, attended by the Court, advance—Flourish. King. Daughter! you haven't made much haste, methinks! Gra. Father, you've made too much! Grog. What means the minx? King. Salute your stepmother, as is your duty. Gra. Madam, your servant. Grog. So this is the beauty Of whom I've heard so much. Beauty, indeed! If she were half as handsome as her steed, She might be called a beauty. Sir, d'ye mean To let your daughter thus insult your Queen? King. Insult? Grog. You offered me a sorry hack, Whilst her you've placed on an Arabian's back! King. Not I, I never saw the beast before. Grog. False man, farewell. King. (aside) Confound it! Here's a bore. (to Grognon) My duck of diamonds! (to Graciosa) Daughter, get you down, And give place to the partner of my crown. Gra. (dismounts) Remember, sir, 'twas your command. King. Of course. Now, dearest (to Grognon), let me help you to your horse. Grog. (aside) I triumph! (to Percinet) Sirrah, run thou by my side. Per. (letting go the bridle) I wish your Majesty a pleasant ride! The moment Percinet lets go the bridle, the horse starts off with the Duchess, she screaming and holding on by the mane. Chorus—“The Tank.” King and Chorus. Catch him! stop him! Zounds! what a pace he goes, Sure he'll frighten her into fits. Ah me—there see—down she is upon her nose! Pick her up—she must be broke to bits. King. Oh, the sad, the terrible calamity! Such a scurvy trick of fate was really never known, Just as we were all in peace and amity, And I with her had shared my crown, to go and crack her own! Gentlemen, Guards, &amp;c., who have rushed out, re-enter, bringing in the Duchess, very much dilapidated, in a chair. King. Revive, my treasure! live, my precious life! But for an hour or so to be my wife! You wouldn't die and leave me—nothing? No! You'll make your will, at least, before you go. Oh, speak one word; just name me your sole heir! She don't—she won't! Grog. (starts up and points to Graciosa) Seize on that traitress there. King. She lives! she speaks! and we may yet be married. Grog. (more furiously to Guards) Seize her, I say! (Guards seize her) Gra. (to Grognon) By rage too far you're carried. (to King) Will you behold your daughter treated so, sir? Grog. Aye, or we part for ever. King. (aside) That's a poser! Grog. D'ye hesitate? Farewell, I'll marry no man! King. Hold! I'm a father! but I'll be a Roman! Be justice done on my unhappy child; The sword is in your hands, but draw it mild. Chorus —“Diamans de la Couronne.” O day of horror, day of woe! A vicious brute her grace to throw! A rum 'un she, to look at, tho'; And he a good 'un was to go! Solo. Gra. Why, ma'am, should vengeance light On me in such a case? What horse would not take fright When it saw your grace? Chorus. O day of horror, &amp;c. Closed in by</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —A Chamber in the Palace. Enter Grognon and Attendants, bringing a chair. Grog. Now drag the traitress here, before me, haste! Of Grognon's vengeance she shall have a taste. Graciosa is brought in by Attendants, with whips. Gra. Madam, for mercy at your feet I kneel, I'm taxed with treason: surcharged, I appeal! Grog. Appeal, forsooth! your case is quickly stated— Your charms alone have been too highly rated; You shall no longer, child, be taxed for beauty, But to ourself you shall pay treble duty! You have made false returns to me for years, And now I seize on you for all arrears! For special purposes, see my Commissioners. (points to Attendants) Gra. Appeal to them! Heaven help the poor petitioners. Grog. To execution! Ply your cat o' nine tails. Gra. (aside) O Percinet! What use were all your fine tales! (the scourges change to plumes of feathers—the Attendants beat her) Grog. Harder, yet harder. On her pangs I feast. Gra. (aside) How strange—they do not hurt me in the least! Sweet Percinet has heard me, I declare! Grog. The stubborn jade pretends she doesn't care. Make her cry out, I long to hear her groan! Gra. (aside) I'll sham a little. (aloud) Oh! let me alone! Grag. Ha, ah! at last my rods begin to tickle! They've been for you a precious time in pickle! Lash on! lash on! Until I bid you stop. 1st Woman. Madam, our arms are ready off to drop; Yet, on the culprit we make no impression! (trumpets without) Grog. What means that flourish? Enter Nimroddy. Nim. Madam, the procession Is passing to the lists, and 'tis my duty To marshall to her throne the Queen of Beauty. Grog. Ecstatic sound! New life it quite infuses! 'Tis opodeldoc to my bumps and bruises! You minion! (to Graciosa) follow humbly in my train And mark, these whips will cut and come again. Enter the King, Heralds, Nobles, and Ladies of the Court, and six Knights, viz.—Sir Regent Circus, Knight of the Bull and Mouth; Sir Lad Lane, Knight of the Swan with Two Necks; Sir Snow Hill, Knight of the Saracen's Head; Sir Ludgate Hill, Knight of the Belle Sauvage; Sir Fleet Street, Knight of the Bolt-in-Tun; and Sir Charing Cross, Knight of the Golden Cross. Chorus —“To the gay Tournament.” To the gay tournament The Queen of Beauty goes, He shall gain a prize from her Who most his courage shows; Singing, singing—“Though others fair may be, Nobody, nobody, can be compared to thee.” Grog. Soon will the conqueror, With trophy and with wreath, Kneel on his bended knee, My throne low beneath; Singing, singing,—“Though others fair may be, Nobody, nobody can be compared with me.” King, Lord Nimroddy, and Graciosa (aside) Bold must the champion be Who can that boast maintain; He, for audacity, The prize must surely gain. Swinging, hanging on the highest tree, For such a lie, such a lie, he deserves to be. Chorus. To the gay tournament, &amp;c. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —Tilt-yard of the Palace. The lists set out for a tournament—throne for the Queen of Beauty—another for the King—a chair of state for the Princess—Pavilions of the Knights Challengers, &amp;c., &amp;c. Grognon, King, Graciosa, Knights, Courtiers, Guards, Heralds, &amp;c., discovered. Herald. O yes! O yes! O yes! take notice, pray, Here are six noble knights in arms to-day, Who swear that never yet was lady seen So lovely as our new-elected Queen! Against all comers they will prove 'tis so. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes! Enter Percinet, in green armour. Per. I say, oh no! Grog. Who's this Jack-in-the-green? Gra. (aside) Sure I know who! King. Do you know what you say? Per. And mean it, too! King. How! Come to court and say just what you mean? You're a green knight indeed! Per. Sir Turnham Green! Of Brentford's royal house a princely scion, Knight of its ancient order, the Red Lion; Baron of Hammersmith, and Count of Kew, Marquis of Kensington, and Lord knows who. But all these titles willingly I waive For one more dear—Fair Graciosa's slave! I'll prove it on the crest of great or small, She's Beauty's Queen who holds my heart in thrall, And Grognon is a foul and ugly witch! King. If you're a gentleman behave as sich! Per. Come one, come all! here I throw down my gage! King. A green gage seemingly! Grog. I choke with rage! To arms—my knights! (the Knights enter their pavilions) Gra. I'll bet a crown he mills 'em. King. Laissez aller! That's go it, if it kills 'em! Flourish—The Knights issue by turns from the pavilion, and are overthrown one after the other by Percinet during the following. Air and Chorus—“La Marquesa de Amagenie.” Per. Regent Circus, gallant and spruce, sir; Knight of the Bull and Mouth—cowed you soon are! Look out, Lad Lane, Now Gresham Street. 'tis of no use, sir; Both her neck's broken, your swan's but a goose, sir; Grognon's a Gorgon, a horrid scarecrow, sir! My Queen of Beauty is Graciosa! Chorus. Bravo! bravo! Green Knight for ever! His Queen of Beauty is Graciosa! Per. Snow Hill—go ill it must with you, sir; Head of the Saracen—broken you are! T'other brother—down you go too, sir! 'Tis plain your Belle Sauvage is but a Medusa; The belle of all belles, and the pride of all beaux, sir, Is my Queen of Beauty—fair Graciosa! Chorus. Bravo! bravo! &amp;c. Per. Fleet Street—fleetly 'twas well that you flew, sir! (he runs away) Your bolt is soon shot—ha, ha, ha, ha! Charing Cross—he don't know what to do, sir; Ere we cross swords you had better bolt too, sir! (he lays down his arms and retires) Cock of the walk, I have proved my words true, sir; Hail Queen of Beauty—fair Graciosa! Chorus. Bravo bravo! Green Knight for ever! Hail Queen of Beauty—fair Graciosa! Grog. All my six champions floored—disgrace! despair! King. It had been so with us had we been there! Grog. Down with your gauntlet and defy him, King. King. I defy him—to think of such a thing! Per. Wisely you act, for, modestly to speak, You'd get knock'd into the middle of next week. (Exit) Grog. What! you a soldier and bear this disgrace? King. I'm far too old a soldier him to face— Fight him yourself, love, and see how you like it. (Exit) Grog. Coward! But whilst the iron's hot I'll strike it. Upon my rival I can vengeance take. Gra. (aside) What will she do to me, for goodness sake? Grog. (to Guards) In the great forest to a tree go bind her, As she's the Beauty, there the Beast may find her! Gra. One comfort 'tis, whatever beast I view, ma'am, It can't be such a horrid brute as you, ma'am. (music—Graciosa is dragged off)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —A Forest—Graciosa is dragged in by the Guards, who bind her to a tree. Gra. Monster in human shape! I wouldn't gall you, But really I don't know what else to call you, Your conduct to me is so very bad. You have no children, butchers! if you had The thoughts of them would make you kindly slaughter, And not put out to mangle your King's daughter. Fancy me torn by savage beasts of prey; Lions, not dandy lions of the day; Tigers, not little tigers in top boots; Bears, not stock-brokering Change-alley brutes; And boars society can't match, because Nothing on earth can make them hold their jaws. Oh, take the rope from off my wrists, and tie it About my neck, that I may dangle by it! 1st Guard. We'll see you hanged first. (Exeunt Guards) Gra. Without affection, I should consider it an obligation! They're gone, and I am left to linger long; Oh, what a situation—for a song. Air—“True love can ne'er forget.” Gra. True love can ne'er forget; Long here I should not fret Were I still, Percinet, Your darling one; This very day you said, When first your bow you made, If I required your aid, You'd to me run. But “out of mind when out of sight,” I'm afraid the proverb's right; Of your promise you'll think light, And brown I shall be done. True love can ne'er forget; Long here I should not fret Were I still, Percinet, Thy darling one! At the end of song the Forest becomes illuminated, groups of Fairies, dressed as Shepherds and Shepherdesses, are seen in picturesque attitudes—Percinet, with the Fairy Chrystallina (his mother) and her two Daughters—The Crystal Palace of Percinet is seen in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. Gra. But soft, what light breaks through the gloom so dun? It is the east, and Percinet's the sun. Per. Yes, lovely Graciosa, there's no other; I am an only son, and here's my mother. My sisters, also, who'll be proud to know you, And happy any courtesy to shew you. Fairy. I'm quite delighted at this introduction. Per. Say to our union now there's no obstruction. Gra. Oh, pardon me, without my pa's permission I could not think of changing my condition. Per. Your pa's consent? Gra. No girl should wed without it. Fairy. (to her Daughters) Hear that, young ladies, and think well about it. (to Graciosa) Your conduct has my perfect approbation. Clandestine matches are my detestation. (aside Lovely as Venus, prudent as Minerva! I'm glad my boy has been her life preserver. Per. Yonder's my Crystal Palace. Gra. Really, is it? Fairy. I hope with us you'll pay it a short visit. Gra. Oh, surely, madam, for in your society There cannot be the slightest impropriety. Per. You're just in time to honour, by the way, Our Fête Champêtre and Bal Costumé. Chorus—“Dance the Boatman's Dance.” Percinet and Chorus . The Fairies dance, the Fairies sing, The Fairies' up to everything! We polk and flirt whilst mortals snore, At Almack's they can do no more. Dance the Fairies' dance, O dance the Fairies' dance, O! Dance all night, till the broad day-light, And go home with our girls in the morning! The Fairy laughs at the wisest man, There's none can do as the Fairy can, Never knew a pretty girl in my life, But wished she was a Fairy's wife. Dance the Fairies' dance, &amp;. Over the mountains he can frisk, Through the keyhole he can whisk; The wind may blow, the waves may toss, The Fairy's never at a loss. Dance the Fairies' dance, &amp;c.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene Seventh. —Ramparts of the Crystal Palace. Enter Graciosa and Percinet. Per. Wilt thou begone? It is not yet near day. Gra. You really must not press me in this way, Nor follow me about, it's not correct. Per. Do I not treat you with profound respect? Gra. I grant, but folks will talk; besides, I'd rather Go home now, if you please, and see my father. Per. If but to see your father you'd go home, You from this palace need no farther roam. Gra. Indeed! Per. By Claudet's process, in a minute, I'll shew you home and everything that's in it. Gra. Ah, the daguerreotype, but you've no sun. Per. My art makes light of everything—'tis done. Behold the King to whom you have alluded. (the wall has become transparent, and through it the King is seen on his couch—Grognon stands beside him, shewing him a handkershief spotted with blood) Portraits in this style gratis, case included. Gra. Oh, 'tis my father in his morning dress, And he appears to be in great distress. There's Grognon, too—what means that kerchief gory? (Grognon shews the King a scroll, on which is written “Graciosa is dead and buried.”) I dead and buried? What a wicked story! (the King faints and the transparency fades) Pa's poorly! Oh, I knew my loss would grieve him. I must go home at once, and undeceive him. Per. Pattern of daughters, won't a note suffice? A line from you? I'll post it in a trice; 'Tis but a penny, thanks to Rowland Hill. Gra. No, I must post myself. Per. Grognon will kill, Or worse than kill you, she is such a Tartar! Gra. In such a cause as this I'll die a martyr. Per. Cruel, to leave a Prince who loves you so. Gra. If you so loved me, you would let me go. Per. Enough; I am your slave, relentless fair, Thus I destroy love's castle in the air. Strikes the wall—it breaks to pieces and sinks, shewing</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Eighth. —A Chamber in the King's Palace as before. Gra. Oh, Lud! he's broken it to little bits. I vow you've scared me quite out of my wits. Per. Behold, you stand upon your father's floor On earth; you'll never see my palace more, Nor me, unless you send for me. Adieu, And may you find another friend as true. Air—Percinet—“Cam' ye by Athol?” Can you forget all my vows? They would fill a bag. Or the Thames Tunnel, from bank to bank, nearly! Saw you a lad ever fairer or better made, That you behave to me so very queerly? Really, really, don't think I'll follow you, Much as I love you, I tell you now, fairly, Merely, merely, should grim Death swallow you, I from a broken heart shall escape barely. Who, let me ask, in the lists cut a figure more Gallant than him you treat so singularly? Didn't I floor 'em all, never to snigger more, Just as the lads used to floor an old Charley? Really, really, who wouldn't blush for thee, Were all about us told by Peter Parley? Clearly, clearly, you don't care a rush for me, Since to my hopes you put such a finale! (Exit) Gra. Poor Percinet! he's gone in indignation; “Mens conscia recti!”—that's my consolation. My father comes— Enter King. Sir, at your feet behold me. King. Hollo! why you arn't dead, then, as they told me? Gra. No, dearest father, I'm alive and merry! Are you not glad to see me? King. Yes, child, very! But—(seats himself) Daughter, you have your mother much offended! Gra. Father, you have my mother much offended! King. Come, come, don't talk in that style—it's high treason! Gra. Go, go, you shouldn't give me so much reason! King. (rises) Nay then, I'll ring the bell; and by my crown!— Gra. Leave ringing of your bells, and sit you down, And let me wring your heart! King. Why, how now, miss? Gra. Look here, upon this picture, and on this— The counterfeit presentment of two mothers! This was a face—now only look at t'other's! King. It isn't pretty, I confess! Gra. Oh, shame, Where is thy blush? King. Perhaps I was to blame! Gra. Perhaps!—When of all hearts you lost the queen, To wed a queen of clubs?— King. Diamonds, you mean! Gra. A termagant, who makes you, sir, a tool! To whom you've sold your empire and your rule! Nay, pawn'd your precious diadem for gold, To put into your pocket!— King. Daughter, hold! Gra. A Queen of paint and patches! Enter Grognon. Grog. Hoity, toity! Who have we here? King. (aside) Odzooks! my better moiety! Grog. (aside) What do I see?—alive!—returned!—provoking! King. (To Grognon) I find, my love, that you were only joking When you said Graciosa had died recently! Grog. I tell you she is dead, and buried decently. King. Why here she stands! Grog. (aside) Assist me, cool assurance! That's not your daughter. Gra. This is past endurance; Then, pray, who am I? Grog. An impostor, wretch! Whom I have tried for a long time to catch. And now, I have you—(seizing hold of her) Gra. (catching hold of King) Pa, you won't believe her. Grog. Dotard! I say fling off that arch deceiver, Or of my cellar I'll have back the key. King. Nay then, I'm quite convinced it is not she. Duo—“Du-du”—King and Graciosa. King. Do, do, whatever you will, ma'am, (to Grognon) You, you have behaved very ill, ma'am. (to Graciosa) Send her to the treadmill, ma'am, (to Grognon) But leave me your wine cellar key. Gra. Papa, think of mama! And do not so barbarous be! King. Pooh! pooh! Pray who are you? To lecture a monarch like me! (Exit King) Grog. No, not for her the treadmill or the stocks. Ho! (stamps, enter Attendants) Bear her to the dungeon with three locks; Of her fine clothes, which she has stolen, strip her; And we'll do something worse this time than whip her. (they drag Graciosa off) Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift To give a desperate woman a good lift. I do remember that I bought, at Flint's, The subject of one of the songs in the “At Home” of Charles Mathews, the elder, in 1844, was a letter from a country cousin containing an endless list of commissions, each batch of which concluded with “a skein of white worsted from Flint's,” a well-known house in Newport Street, Soho. A large skein of white worsted, some years since, So tangled, none could manage off to wind it. I've a tub somewhere, too, if I could find it, So full of feathers of each kind of bird, That any hope to sort them were absurd. It shall be so; these tasks at once I'll set her, And if she fail—that's all I say—just let her. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Ninth. —A Prison; door with three locks. Enter Attendants with Graciosa, in a poor dress and wooden shoes. 1st Att. How like you your coarse habits, mistress mine? Gra. Your coarser habits make these superfine. 2nd Att. Cramps it your feet in wooden shoes to shove them? Gra. It cannot cramp the soul I've got above them. Enter Grognon. Grog. Bring in the skein of worsted and the cask. (they are brought in and placed in centre) Gra. Pray what are these for, madam, may I ask? Grog. Those feathers sort, unravel me that skein, Ere sunset, or ne'er see it rise again. (Exit, with Attendants, locking door after them) Gra. That woman treats me worse than any Turk; Now here's a pretty job of journey work. (inspecting cask and skein) The proverb says that birds of the same feather Are generally sure to flock together; Upon me 'twould be taking great compassion, If the same feathers kept up the same fashion. And then unravel this; why, I declare, Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care, Not even in a dream could hope to do it. It's worsted, too, then who can cotton to it? Oh, Percinet, had I not you offended, My troubles now would speedily be ended. Percinet rises out of the cask, which at the same moment falls in pieces, each piece having a pile of feathers of the same colour on it—He touches the skein of worsted, and it rolls up into a smooth ball. Gra. Good gracious! came you through the floor or wall? Per. You called on me, and I've returned your call. Gra. At such a friendly visit I'm transported. Per. Madam, your skein is wound, your feathers sorted. Have you no more commands? Gra. Not just at present. Per. Then I may go? Gra. You may. Per. That's mighty pleasant. Will you not with me fly to fairyland, And make me happy with that snow-white hand? Gra. Elope? I, Graciosa, run away, With a young man I've scarcely known a day? Per. Have I not proved the truth of my affection? Gra. One cannot act with too much circumspection. Per. But fix a term, at least, to my probation. Gra. Of all decorum 'twere a violation. Per. Say, live in hope— Gra. All men, I hope, live so. Per. Far from your presence, then, again I go. But you again may persecuted be, And then, perchance, you may remember me. Air—Percinet—“When other lips and other hearts”—(Balfe) When other whips, with other smarts, Their tails of nine cats tell, In language which not all the parts Of speech can do so well; There may, perhaps, in such a scene, Some recollection be, Of plumes which scourges might have been, And you'll remember me. When to a tree you're tied up tight. To be some monster's prize, Or tangled skeins of worsted white Perplex your hands and eyes; When here again they bear a cask 'Twill break your heart to see, Or set you some still harder task, Then you'll remember me. (Exit) Gra. I pity him, but like Tom Thumb of yore, “I've done my duty and I've done no more.” Enter Grognon and Attendants, hastily. Grog. The sun has set, prepare to die. Gra. For what? My tasks are finished. Grog. (amazed) Well, may I be shot! Gra. Amen to that, sweet powers, and quickly fire! Grog. How? Gra. I but echoed, ma'am, your own desire. Grog. So you've arranged these plumes with great facility. Gra. And rather plume myself on my ability. Grog. And wound the worsted up into a ball? Gra. I have; so you are worsted, ma'am, that's all, Grog. (aside) Some magic power must sure protect the jade; But I will summon magic to my aid. (to Attendants) Bring me the box that stands upon my table. (Exeunt Attendants) (to Graciosa) Since you have proved yourself so very able, I'll trouble you to do but one thing more, Which done, shall you to liberty restore. Gra. Haste me to know it. Re-enter Attendants, with box. Grog. It is but to carry This box to my old castle; do not tarry. Here is the key, I trust it to your keeping, For I am sure you would not think of peeping, However the contents might interest you. In my black cabinet, I must request you To place it safely and return with speed. Gra. Well, this appears an easy task, indeed; It isn't heavy, though it's such a long box. Grog. (aside) Open it, minx, and you are in the wrong box. (aloud) I've said to liberty it shall restore you. Gra. I fly! (Exit, followed by Attendants) Grog. You may, but I'll be there before you. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Tenth. —A Grove and Meadow—Twilight—An old well with a large stone upon it. Enter Graciosa, carrying box. Gra. Thus far, upon the errand I was sent, I have marched on without impediment; But as around me close the shades of night, Something cries “don't go on, it's not all right.” Grognon has thought to get me in a line; She's studied in the worst school of design. What's in this box that to me she should trust it, In her black cabinet with speed to thrust it, Unopened? Ha! some dark intrigue political, Which makes her cabinet's position critical. Or, mercy on me! some machine infernal, Which at that moment may explode and burn all. But why in guessing should time wasted be, When of the riddle here I have the key? Not peep! indeed I will, though, if I choose it; She gives me right of search, and I will use it. (places box down and opens it—Music—A number of little Men and Women come out of it, some dressed as ladies and gentlemen, others as cooks and musicians, the Cooks with culinary utensils, the Musicians with their instruments) Why, as I live, it is a box of playthings! Oh, what a regiment of little gay things! Cooks, fiddlers, lords, and ladies—oh, how funny! I'd not have missed this sight for any money. (the Musicians begin to play, the Ladies and Gentlemen dance, the Cooks dress supper—chimes in the distance) But longer here I really mustn't wait, And little folks should not sit up so late; You must to bye-bye, in the box again. (they all run away) Come, come, don't run away—I talk in vain. The tiny wretches with my patience tamper, The little scamps in all directions scamper; What shall I do? ah, now too late I see The trap that wicked Grognon laid for me. Oh, fatal, fatal curiosity! Thou woman's failing, which, from Jove's Pandora, To Blue Beard's Fatima, has been our floorer. Nothing can save me now, unhappy maid! On Percinet I dare not call for aid; I've used him much too ill, and must be dumb; The more I called the more he wouldn't come. Enter Percinet. Per. Behold him here! no welcome guest, it seems, Except when you are driven to extremes. Air—Rossini's “La Danza.” Ho! ye tiny imps of mischief, Hither troop ye at my call, Or, as sure as Christmas is coming, I'll make mincemeat of you all. Run, you little rogues, all in a row, Into your box, you rascals, go. Presto, presto! cooks, come get you in, or I'll baste you every one. Presto, presto! fiddlers, quick into your fiddle-cases run! Presto, presto! lords and ladies gay, 'tis time to finish your fun. Presto, presto! footmen, trip away, your duty now is done. Don't you hear? Don't you hear? Run, you little rogues, all in a row. Bogie's coming! Bogie's coming! Bogie's coming! Into your box, you rascals, go! La, la, la, la! (music—All the little Men and Women re-appear, and run into the box—Percinet shuts lid) My service done, I, like the well-bred cur, Walk out before I'm— Gra. Hold, I pray you, sir; Spare your reproaches, too, too generous youth; I'm all confusion, really, that's the truth; But duty—and reflect, your pangs to soothe, The course of true love never did run smooth. Per. My truth is proved, then? Gra. That was what my speech meant. Per. And you love me? Gra. I own the soft impeachment. Per. Blest sounds! then name the happy day. Gra. Oh la! I must, indeed, refer you to papa. Per. Should he refuse? Gra. Why, then my heart will break. And I shall die, unmarried, for thy sake. Per. Pearl of thy sex! I hasten to propose! Gra. How I shall reach the castle, goodness knows, In time—for yet it isn't e'en in view. Per. Don't stir a step; I'll make it come to you. Music—the Castle appears at wing—Exit Percinet. Gra. Obliging edifice! (knocks at gates) The gates open, and enter Grognon and Attendants. Grog. How now, who knocks? Gra. (aside) She here before me! Ma'am, I've brought the box. Grog. Escaped again! then nothing can affect her. (to her) The key! (aside) This lock's a patent Chubb's detector. (tries it) No proof against her! (aloud) You have loiter'd, slut. Gra. Perhaps you came, ma'am, by a shorter cut. Grog. (aside) I must a shorter cut to vengeance find, Or she will drive me clean out of my mind. Ha! the dry well! she shall help lift the cover, And when she least expects it, in I'll shove her. Gra. Give me my liberty now you've your casket. Grog. You're taking a great liberty to ask it. Gra. I've served my time out fairly, ma'am, and sigh Now to be made free—(aside) of your company. Grog. Well, 'twas a bargain, therefore be it so! But do me one small favour e'er you go. Gra. A favour, surely; with the greatest pleasure. Grog. I dreamt that 'neath yon stone there lies a treasure; You're young and strong—assist me off to bear it, And if we find a treasure you shall share it. Gra. I need no bribe a civil act to do. Grog. Come, help, then. (they push the stone) Gra. There it goes. (stone rolls off) Grog. And there go you! (pushes Graciosa into well) Gra. (as she disappears) Help, Percinet! Grog. Ah! 'tis all over with her! Down, down the well, and say I sent thee thither— I, who have neither pity, love, nor fear! (music—the Fairy Chrystallina appears) Fairy. No fear! we'll try that, wretch. (stamps) Envy rises up trap. Grog. Ah! who comes here? Something that doesn't seem at all to suit us. Speak, what art thou? Fairy. Thy evil spirit, Brutus! Envy! that gnaw'd thy heart by night and day, And to whose torments thou shalt die a prey; For lo! unhurt, fair Graciosa fell, And found truth at the bottom of a Well. Envy seizes Grognon and sinks with her down trap—The scene rises and discovers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Eleventh. —Subterranean gardens of the Crystal Palace, at the bottom of the well—Graciosa insensible in the arms of Percinet—the King, the Daughters of Fairy Chrystallina, Fairies, &amp;c. Per. Awake, my bride! Gra. Where am I? Per. In my arms. Gra. Pleasant but wrong— Per. Nay, hush thy fond alarms, Your father here, with his consent I've brought you, And you must own, this time, I've fairly caught you. Gra. Was I cast down, and did you catch me here? King. He did—but don't be cast down now, my dear; Since you are well, why the deuce take the pitcher. Fairy. 'Tis done; and by her loss you're all the richer. Per. (to Graciosa) I said, above ground, you should never see My palace more. 'Tis here; and here will we Together reign; if what was well intended, (to Audience) Thus ended in a Well, you'll grant to be well ended. Finale—“The Charming Woman”—(Haynes Bayly) King. Graciosa is going to marry, If you've no objection to make; And Grognon is gone to old Harry— The very best step she could take! So we hope that this match you'll approve, Let the critics say all that they can; For my daughter's a charming woman, And her husband's a sweet pretty man. Per. You've brothers and sisters by dozens, And all charming people, no doubt; And perhaps you've some young country cousins, Who this Christmas you'd like to bring out. Then, kind friends, if you'll take my advice, Bring them hither as soon as you can, To visit this charming woman, And make me a most happy man. CURTAIN.</field>
