      <field name="fulltext">FREDOLFO; A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF LEINSTER. My Lord, I have solicited your Grace's permission to dedicate this Tragedy to you, not merely on account of your exalted rankâ though that is the highest in your native country; not merely on account of your condescension to literary menâthough that has induced you to notice efforts even humble as mine; but, because to the scattered nobility of a deserted Country, you set the rare and illustrious example of a resident Irish Nobleman. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Grace's very humble and obedient Servant, CHARLES ROBERT MATURIN.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Timeâthe Fourteenth Century.âSceneâthe Residence of Fredolfo, on Mount St. Gothard, and at Altdorf in the neighbourhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Who has not heard of that romantic clime, Where, throned in wildness, Nature reigns sublime; Where the young peasant, 'mid creation's shock, Slumbers in peace upon his cradle rock; And as the lightnings flash and thunders roll, To danger educates his ardent soul; Till the full spirit, now in years mature,â As its own mountain-torrent grand and pureâ Worships the spot where despotism fell, And fate and freedom wing'd the shaft of Tell! Britons! o'er such a scene the Muse to-night Rises rejoicing on her plumes of light, Proudly assured to every bosom here The soil of liberty is doubly dear! Yet is not war her sanguinary themeâ The statesman's madness, or the warrior's dream! The sad vicissitudes of mortal weal, The pangs that all have felt, or yet may feelâ A daughter's anguish, and a father's fallâ Such is our theme to-night:âof Nature's call What human breast, till life's last awful hour, Denies the echo or disowns the power?â Not for his theme, but Muse, the stranger fears, Nor dreams of plaudits, so he win but tears!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Gothic Hall in the Castle of Fredolfo; Waldo and a Minstrel seated at a table, with wine. The Minstrel touching a chord on his harp, as the curtain draws up, as if he had just concluded an air. Night: storm heard without. Waldo starts up. Wal. Hush!âhark!â The warder on the tower hath blown his blast.â It is my lordâwhere are those loitering knaves? Enter Page, with a torch. How now, Sir boy, ye keep brave order here!â Did ye not hear the summoning blast that sent Its deep low tremblings on the hollow wind? Page. I stood upon the warder's tower, and listen'd;â There was no voice, nor lip of man to breathe it. Minstrel. âIt was the wind, or else the hooting owl, âOr some wild sound of the many voiced mountain, âSuch as men oft in mountain regions hear. âSit down, that I may touch my harp again. Wal. âPeace, peace, I pray thee; peaceâhow looks the night?â Page. It is a fearful and a stormy night; Woe to the traveller, who in such an hour Must scale St. Gothard's height! Wal. Away, thou loiterer! Where is the beacon that should burn so bright? Where is the taper in the latticed casement, Shedding its star-like ray, to guide the traveller? Away! and from the vale should trampling hoof Or horn be heard, or torch-led litter gleam, Let all his battlements ring with the blast That gives Fredolfo welcome! [Exit Page. (Pausing as the storm increases.) Hush! the stormâ It gives a thrilling answer to my speech.â Oh, I do fear some evil from this night! Min. Why doth he leave at such unwonted hour His shelter'd home in Altdorf's pleasant walls, Giving his hoary age to the wind's rudeness,â Which the cloak'd churl would shrink from at such hourâ And bearing to these wilds his lovely daughter? Wal. What boots it thee to know? he hath his reasons.â On with thy tale, or song, to speed the moments! Min. What, shall I tell thee of a stern old carle, Who chid the curious wishes of a minstrel, All-while he burn'd to tell the tale himself? Wal. Go to! thou art insolent and curious too.â I have no taleâ'tis all but doubt and wonder! â'Tis weary watching for the traveller âWho journeys in the night, and wearier still âWatching for those who with the tempest meet âThe dark and wrestling angel of the night; âBut, oh! 'tis sad to watch the lamp for him âWho seeks his home as men explore a charnelâ âA place of foul and festering recollections;â âWhose walls a viewless hand hath traced with writing,â âWhose floors have daggers for the foot that treads them. Min. âWhat dost thou mean by these mysterious words?â Wal. Ten years have pass'd, since Lord Fredolfo journey'd To meet the Syndics in the halls of Altdorf.â He was the country's idolâSwitzerland, Through all her rescued cantons, bless'd her champion; For, when he sat in council, from his head Sprang Liberty, a living goddess arm'd! Nor lack'd his hand the thunder to defend her.â So he went forthâthe people blessing him;â His wife and infant daughter here remain'd,â He kiss'd them on the morn of his departure, But not on his return:âHark!âHark!âwhat noise [Minstrel rises.âThrough the casement is seen a display of the effects of a storm, in a mountainous country. Min. âThe storm in his dark might hath gone abroad âAmong the mountains;âall their echoes answer âThe giant anthem of a thousand caverns âThat day hath never look'd on:â âThere is a blackness in the hurtling air, âAs light had never been:â âWoe to the traveller in a night like this!â Wal. It was a night like this, of woe and fear, (The stormy twilight of a winter's eve,) Fredolfo to these towers return'd in hope.â His child, alone, to meet her father ranâ No mother led her there:âhe flung her off, He called her mother's name, and echo mock'd him;â The silence of the menials answer'd him,â They knew not her dark fate, nor aught could tell him. Min. Where was his wife? Wal. Who knew? who knows even now? She was no more, yet no one mark'd her end:â Her veil and zone, flung on a fearful rock, Through whose worn arch the mountain-torrent struggled, Were all her fate's memorial. Min. Merciful heaven! Was there no trace, no answering event? Wal. Yes, there was one; on that same fearful night The Austrian governor, stern Wallenberg, Lay on yon rocks a stark and weltering corse.â It was a horrid sight to see him borne Within these walls, stretch'd out upon this pavement; His unclosed eyes, clench'd hands, and bared teeth, Fix'd in the strength of the last horrible agony, Show'd he had struggled felly with the hands That dealt with him. ââWhy dost thou gaze upon me? Min. âI know not why I gazeâon with thy tale. Wal. âThere is a dizzy trembling in my brain, âWhene'er I see that visionâthat lost wifeâ âAnd then that Austrian tyrantââThrough the cantons Still sounds the cry, âWho will reveal the murderer?â His tyrant son still urges the rewardâ In vain; the grave its secret darkly kept, And from that hour these walls a master knew not. Why now he seeks them, ask me not to tell. Enter Page, hastily. Page. There is a voice of terror from the vale, Neighing of startled steeds, and shouts of horsemen; And feebly mingling with the deep-toned blast, I heard a female's cries. Wal. It is the daughter of Fredolfo! Haste, Away! bear torches, throw the portal wide:â [Exit Page. Full strait and perilous is the path by day, Which that lorn lady must in darkness tread. [A confused noise without. Enter Berthold. Ha! Bertholdâher attendant!âWhere's thy lady? Bert. Curse on the tremblings of this pithless arm, That vainly struggled with her frighted steed, While to the flood he bore his screaming burden! Wal. His screaming burden? Heavens! she perishes!â Coward! thou saw'st her danger, and thou fled'st! Thou thing of weakness and deformity, 'Twas thy ill-omen'd visage scared her palfrey! Would I could tarry longer here to curse thee! [Rushes out with the rest. Bert. Coward, deform'd, and spurn'd!âCan I not stab him?â Why, when my fingers would enwring his throat, Does my bedew'd and quivering flesh recoil?â All loathsome things are things of danger tooâ Even the small spider hath his drop of poison, As deadly as the vast and volumed serpent's.â IâI, alone, must writhe in impotence, Gasp with unutter'd curses, and crush darkly The abortive births of mischief in their throes. [Confused sound of voices withoutâVassals enter with torches, and Waldo, bearing Urilda in his arms, in a swoon. Vassals. She lives! she's saved!âA stranger's arm hath saved her! Bert. (snatching her from Waldo) Stand back!â'twas to my care her father gave her. Fellow, stand back! no arm but mine shall clasp her. (Pausing over her.) Oh! it renews the heart to gaze on thee! Thou thing of power, that hast not life, but givest it:â Thou beauteous even in deathâmaking death beauteous! Those softly closed lids, in whose rich veil The unseen light dwells lovely,âthe wan cheek, Amid whose pallid bower death weds with beauty; The faintly-falling arms, the woe-bent headâ Oh! still be thus! Oh, yes, be ever thus!â While thus I see thee calm, I deem thee kind. Those eyes will opeâto turn their light from me; Those arms will wave, to chide me with their softness; And, oh! that lip,âthat rubied cup of bliss, That flows with joy for all, pour hate on me! Wal. (incensed) Audacious!âto the daughter of thy lord!â [Urilda recovering, and starting from the arms of Berthold, whom she views with horror. Uril. Ha! saved by thee!âimpossible!âwhere was I? There was an armâit was not thine, that saved me. Wal. No, lady, no; he fledâthe coward fled! Thy scatter'd train, storm-struck, aghast, and trembling, Consign'd thee to his care, who cared for nought But the vile freight of his most worthless carcase, Whose fragments even the rending rocks had scorn'd. Uril. (starting at the sound) Amid the rocks!âAy! there, 'twas there he found me! The horrid avalanche came thundering downâ Angel of wrathâmost horrible in whiteness; Pale desolation's ghastly smile,âthat smile More fearful than its frownâI saw, and fled,â And when o'er the wild chasm my courser paused, Where the rent pine had flung a fearful arch, I knew that I was there, but knew not how!â A dizzy whirl of nothingness and horrorâ My brain is giddy!âmine own shrieks are there! The chasm yawns black beneath meâthat black chasm! And then, a mist of fireâand then an armâ Cries were my breath!âI shriek'd, even though it saved me. Wal. Shame on yon craven's flight! It was a stranger, A youth unknown, nor mingled with your train; When even the boldest rein'd their steeds in horror, With desperate steps he scaled that bridge of death, With desperate arm he snatch'd thee from its verge; Nor paused his foot, nor fail'd his nervous grasp, Till safe he placed thee in thy vassals' arms. Uril. Speak,âmy deliverer! wherefore comes he not? Will he not hear me bless him? Doth he scorn Thanks from the lip, whose life his gift hath been? Why are ye silent? (gazing round her.) Wal. Strange was his demeanor; His cheek glow'd freshly; and, as on he bore you, We well could mark his high heroic form; But, when his eye upon the sculptured walls That fence your towers, had caught Fredolfo's name, From his lax arms their senseless burthen dropp'd, And stern he parted, shunning further question. Uril. Is this a dream? I am Fredolfo's daughterâ And does a son of Switzerland think scorn To save the child of him who saved his country? Does not the heart that hears his name expand Like palace-gates to greet some glorious guest?â Away, and seek him! [Exeunt Waldo and vassals. (Turning, and starting at seeing herself alone with Berthold.) Ha! thou lingering there! Art thou there still, and I alone with thee? Oh! seek him too! Bert. Seek him? the happy youth, Who press'd that form to his high-heaving side,â Who saw thy smile of death in silence bless him! Seek him!âNo;âbid me wrestle with the storm, When on the ice-rock the quench'd lightning hisses;â Bid me with forceless grasp seize thy steed's reinâ Feel thee rent from meâfeel another save theeâ While o'er my trampled form thy pages trod, And, passing, laugh'd at the loath'd lump they spurn'd; Scorn'd, strengthless, beautylessâall, all but loveless!â Bid me do aught but leave thee in thy scornâ Bid me do aught but seek that happy youth! Uril. (with horror) Ah, wretch! thou didst not save meâhence! begone! My quivering flesh recoils when thou art near. Why do I shudder at thee? what art thou, Slave of my father, to Fredolfo's daughter? Darest thou to breathe thy mad and horrid passion?â What, though my sire, in all but that most wise, Makes pastime of thy doating loathsomeness, What, though he chides me when I shrink from theeâ Bert. Shrink from meâHa! ha! ha! Uril. Forbear! forbear! Thy laugh is even more hideous than thy form! Ah! curse me rather! from those leprous lips Curses would sound like blessings! Bert. (with bitter irony) Bless thee, then. Now wilt thou hear me, lady? Uril. Bless thy foes, Not me, not meâthou thing of hideous form! I loatheâI tremble atâI pity thee! Bert. (approaching her, while she shrinks) Loathe me, and tremble tooâbut, dare not pity. Wouldst thou a subject meet for pity know,â A theme to melt thy gleaming eye of beauty Like evening's quench'd star, shining through its dewsâ Pityâthy father! [Exit Berthold. Uril. Ha! what meant the slave? There was a glare from his abhorred eye,â A livid light, like that the thunder-cloud Sheds o'er the pale and stilled earth beneath, Before it bursts and blasts it! Faintness and terror are upon meâO, For the brave arm that saved me, to sustain me! [She totters, through weakness. (Adelmar enters, attended by Waldo, whom he waves off, and advances slowly alone.) (Gazing with doubt and amazement) He comes! oh, God! it cannot, cannot be!â And does he dare amid these walls to seek me? For me he trembledâfor himself he fears not. (Rushing up to him.) Away! away! thou must not enter here! There is a voice from out these walls forbids thee!â My father hates thee, tracks thy hunted stepsâ (Relaxing from fear into tenderness, and falling into his arms.) Adelmar, art thou here?âand was it thou? Adel. Yes; Adelmar, the unowned, the wanderer, The strangerâalmost to himself unknown; He, o'er whom midnight murder darkly watches, He, who on unseen daggers plants his steps, And tramples them to clasp thee:âYes, I follow'd thee O'er the dark mountainsâthrough the night I follow'd;â The spirits of the tempest raised their arms To snatch thee, and I grappled with their might,â Wrestled with them in darkness, and o'ercame them. Bright star, emerging sole on my fate's blackness, Shed thy last light on me! (kneeling) 'twill be the last! Uril. (after a pause of agony) It willâit must!âWhy does my father hate thee? Away!âamid these hostile walls there is not Safety for theeâthough thou hast saved their daughter. Adel. Hate me!âI could to my forgiving breast Claspâyea, weep o'er the man that hated me! But, oh! thy father spurn'd me; when my glaive Had smote the proudest helm that Altdorf boasts, When this young arm from practised chiefs in tourney Had rent its pledge, to lay it at thy feetâ Thou, thou Urilda, on my glowing brow Would'st then have placed the wreath my toils had won.â I saw thine eye's young gleam, and felt the lance Was easier baffled than its wound of light; I saw thy cheek of rose, and felt the frown Of death-arm'd brows less awful than thy blush! I saw the trembling of thy hand of snow, And felt the grappling of an armed gauntlet Was pastime to that touch which made me tremble! Then, thenâthy fatherâ Uril. (rushing to him, and placing her hand on his lips.) Hush! he is my father! Adel. (throwing her off) He spurn'd me, tore thee from me, bade thy hand Bind round thy meanest groom the blushing wreath, Sooner than on that conqueror's browâHe spurn'd me! Uril. (weeping) Had he spurn'd me, I must have loved him stillâ But thou, to whom his daughter's tears are triumphs, If that her agony no pity moves,â Though thou dost outrage nature, honour, virtue;â Revere the name his country's sons revere,â Fredolfo's name! (in a tone of command.) Adel. (solemnly.) I am the child of woe, Of persecution, and of mystery; Fredolfo's nameâthe name his country worshipsâ Rung in my infant dreams.âI was a boy, Wild and imaginative, full of thoughts That mountain-spirits to their children whisper, I might have been a hero! Uril. Might have been! Thou art! Adel. I should have been, but for thy father! A peasant child, amid the mountain steeps, St. Gothard's heights I wander'dâthe storm's shrieks I heard, and echoed in wild fearless mirth, Like children, who in awful ignorance sport;â There came another shriek,âa shriek of murder! [Urilda shudders. Uril. (Starting and agitated.) Murder! but, then, my father was not there,â Or was thereâbut to save? Adel. I will not speakâ Dark thoughts came thronging with that night's remembrance. Twice, twice, with horrible strength the voice shrieked murder! I flew in madness there.âAmid the night Darkly I grappled with two shadowy forms, Beneath whose gripe a struggling warrior heaved, Then lay a corse.âI had no arms.â Uril. No arms? Could'st thou not kneel to them, and weep, and pray? I would, had I been there; I would have clasp'd That dying man in my young pleading arms, And held them up for weapons of defence! Oh! that I had been thereâhe had not perish'd! Adel. They stabb'd meâOn my breast the scar remains! I knelt in blood beside the corse all night, My living blood with the pale corse's mingling.â Uril. Oh! that my father had beheld thee then! So young, so brave, so piteous,âas a child He must have loved thee. Adel. Hath he loved me since? Time pass'd as in a dream, and oft I thought That the dead warrior in his mountain grave Slept unremember'dâthen, by ruffian hands Dragg'd from my hut, all tremblingly, I follow'dâ Far in a sea-toss'd bark the ruffians bore me;â A voice was in the wind, that swell'd the sails,â That charm'd them ne'er to let their freight return! Uril. A voice!âwhat voice? Adel. I know not;âbut I cried, Who tears a freeman from his mountain-home? Who rends the child his country cannot spare From her spread arms? The answer was,âFredolfo! Uril. (Shrieking with amazement.) Impossible! Adel. I cried, âimpossible.â Years, mournful years, in a strange land were wasted,â Wasted to meâthe land was beautifulâ Fair rose the spires, and gay the buildings were, And rich the plains, like dreams of blessed isles; But, when I heard my country's music breathe, I sigh'd to be among her wilds again! I climb'd a bark's tall sideâan arm grasp'd mineâ Struggling, I turn'd, and ask'd who dared withhold me? A dark-eyed ruffian answer'd,â'twas Fredolfo! Uril. (Bursting into vehemence.) It was a villain, liar, fiend, that mock'd thee!â My father rend a child of Switzerland From the dear mountains mountain-children love? My father snatch thee from the bark, that bore Thy steps to seek the bosom of thy home! Away!âin absence, I may try to hate thee. Adel. (Kneeling.) Oh! spurn me, curse me, but thou shalt not hate me! âO'er my wild life of mystery and woe, âA darkly gather'd cloud, one fair beam broke! âO, close not up its light,âit is thine image! âStill let it tremble o'er my stormy fate, âCalming the wave it lights with short bright lustre.â A wanderer,âbanish'd, outlaw'd by thy father, Let me upon the desert shores of life Pause, to unlock the casket of my soul, And gaze upon thy bright and treasured smile, The only gem this lonely heart can boast of:â Smile on my parting steps, and I am blest, Though they to ruin tread! Uril. [softened] O! not to ruin! In other lands thy valour shall be known; In other lands some happier beauty bless thee. Wilt thou, when brighter roses bloom around thee, Think of the bud that wither'd in its wilds? Wilt thou, where balmier lips their nectar shed, Think still of parting passion's last cold kiss? [Sinks into his arms. (Confused noise within, and servants rush across the stage with torches.) Starting from the arms of Adelmar, and addressing the servants who hurry past her. Where dost thou rush in this wild speed of fear? 1st Serv. Our lord!âour lord! the storm! he perishes!â He meets the might of the dark hour alone!â His frighted train have left him in the vale. [Exeunt Servants. Urilda grasps Waldo, who is rushing out with the rest, and detains him. Uril. Speak! tell, where art thou rushing? Wal. Askest thou where, Hearing the wrath of this most awful night? To save my lord, thy father! Know'st thou not, St. Gothard's monks, upon their ice-crown'd towers, Prepare to sound that sole and terrible bell, That tells the traveller's danger? Uril. âTraveller's danger!â It is my father'sâspeak'st thou so of him? And stand I here, and with a daughter's heart, To list the bell that tolls my father's fate? [To Adelmar] Away, and save him, or I am not saved! Adel. [Clasping her to his heart] Yes, thou art saved. Uril. [Starting from him.] Saved, while my father perishes? The bells of St. Gothard's Monastery peal outâ The storm increases, and lightning flashes through the casements. Uril. Hark! hark! it strikes upon my brain! [Adelmar kneels to her. Away! thou mock'st me with false homage! hence! I spurn the life thou gavestâmy father perishes! [Bell tolls again.] Answer not meâ Thine arm is strongâOh! save him! [kneeling. Adel. [Pausing.] One wordâone look, Urilda! Uril. Yes, this word,â This lookâan agonizing daughter's look,â Whose eye hath speech, though her voice failethâthusâ [Falls at his feet. Adel. I fly to save the life, that lives to blast me! [Exit Adelmar. (The storm increases.) Uril. (Clinging to Waldo.) âOh, hold me! let me grasp thee in my terrors! âFor fearfulness is on meâ'tis a night âOf perils, horrors, and of many deaths! âI fix mine eye on the dark floor, but there âThe lightnings flash in many a horrid curve; âI close mine eyesâthe lightning glares through them! âMy father! Heaven have mercy on my father! [Sinking from Waldo's arms to the ground. Wal. âPeace, peace, sad lady, peace! Uril. âWhat tell'st thou me of peace, when Heaven is warring? â(Kneeling.) Ye wing'd and viewless couriers of his march, âWhose chariot is the whirlwind,âwhose dark forms âUnseen, we hear the rushing of your pinions, âI kneel not to you in my heart's strong terrorsâ âI kneel to Him, whose arm hath power o'er yoursâ âHear me! I bend in agonyâOh, hear, âGreat God of nature! List to nature's voice! âA daughter's voice! hold back thy hand, nor dart âThy swift and perilous lightnings on that headâ âSpare him!âA world of crime and woe demands thee! (The storm increases.) â(Rises in terror.) The deep and swelling thunders answer meâ âTh'unnatural glare of the lightnings, horrid noon, âMaking a sunless dayâHe perishes! âAnd IâI linger hereâhis daughter lingers! [Rushing out. Wal. (detaining her.) âWhere wouldst thou rush? Uril. (wildly.) âWhere the tempest raves, âTo bare my bosom to the forked lightnings! âTo shriek in tones that will appal the thunder! âTo yell in nature's ears a daughter's prayer! Wal. (Holding her.) âThou, thou, who trembled at the lightnings' flash? Uril. (Bursting from him.) âI was a woman. Now I am a daughter! âWhy should I fear this battle of the clouds? âI could thy bosom pierce to save my father. [She rushes outâWaldo following. SCENE II. The Mountains of St. Gothard, in the neighbourhood of the CastleâA tremendous stormâThe scene partially illuminated by flashes of lightning âFredolfo's attendants are seen hurrying among the wild passes of the MountainsâA distant view of the Monastery of St. Gothard âThe bell pealing at intervalsâTwo attendants of Fredolfo are seen indistinctly among the Cliffs. 1st Atten. Where is thy lord? 2d Atten. Nay, ask that fearful bell! Why didst thou leave him? Hush! nor answer meâ I hear a horn, 'tis breathing from the valeâ In the deep pausings of the storm I hear itâ Hark! Hark! 1st Atten. It is a stranger's horn that soundsâ That stranger-youth, who cross'd us in our journey! See! see! he totters o'er that gulf of deathâ He plunges inâlost youth, he perishes! [Exeunt. A tremendous chasm among the rocks.âAdelmar is seen extricating Fredolfo, who leans on him exhaustedâAdelmar leads him forward slowly âThe stage very dark. Fred. (without looking up.) What hand hath snatch'd me from my cavern-tomb? Is it a mortal arm on which I lean, Whose power hath burst my bond of adamant? âThe grave had closed upon meâo'er my head âThe meeting rocks form'd an eternal barrierâ âNature's stupendous keepâwhose shackles are âThe ribbed rocksâwhose vault the hollowed mountain;ââ [shudders. Within a lightless dungeon pent to perish, Which mortal hand nor framed nor penetrates,â Below the human ear, the human treadâ The baffled eagle scream'd as far he flewâ The tempest's voice,âa fearful whisper there, It had been bliss to hear it roar in freedom!â There was a viewless stream beside my foot, Whose waves no light, whose lapse no echo knew:â [recovering the sense of his situation. Speak to me, stranger,âthy brave hand feels cold! Tell me whose name I am to bless? Adel. Bless heaven! I am a wretched mortal! fare thee well! Thy train approach, I leave thee to their care. (Torches at a distance.) Fred. (holding him.) Thou shalt not leave me! Bear torches here, I must behold the man Who trembles less at peril than at praise. Adel. (struggling with him.) Hold! know'st thou not with whom thou darkly strugglest? Release me, let me hide from thee for ever! (Fredolfo detains him.) Swear then, whatever form the light disclose, Thou wilt not.âHa! the torches glare! behold me! [The servants enter with torchesâAdelmar flings back his mantle, and gazes on Fredolfo; after a moment's pause of recognition, Fredolfo's countenance assumes the wildest expression of rage and horror. Fred. Ha! Thou,âthou here! the dÃ¦mon sworn to blast me! I rush to hide me 'mid the peopled city,â He haunts me in the streets!âI fly to the mountains,â His hand hath power to reach me in their darkness! Come, bear me in thy talon'd gripe to torture, Let us lie down on beds of fire together, And wallow in fierce ease,âthat I may feel I have no more to fear! [Sinks down. Wal. What means my lord? Fred. (starting up.) Slaves! seize him! drag him to your darkest dungeons! Heap mountains on him, bury him i'the centre, Where light can never pierce. Adel. (struggling with the attendants.) Men! hear me plead, Murder not him, whose arm hath saved your master! [They grapple with him, and get him on his kneesâFredolfo draws his dagger, and rushes towards him, when Urilda entering, flings herself between them. Uril. Spare him! Oh spare! it is your daughter kneels. Fred. Off, frantic wretch!âKnow'st thou for whom thou plead'st? Uril. (in agony.) He saved your life! Fred. Saved it,âto curse, to blight it! Off,âor I curse thee too! Uril. (Flinging her arms round Adelmar, and protecting him.) Curse me,âbut spare him! Fred. (Writhing on seeing her in his arms.) Lock'd in his arms before my withering sight! Then, hear meâThou hast drawn the thunder down, And may it fall and crush thee! Ye dark spirits, âWho quit your homes to range with horrid joy âThe deeper hell of man's changed soul within him,â Who prompt the parent's trembling tongue with curses, Who goad the female heart with brandish'd scorpions, Steep mine in your black venom,âfrom its core Pluck nature's up-torn roots to the last fibre, Though its strings sever tooâwhile o'er the head Of her, who was my childâ [Urilda, who has been listening with horror, releases Adelmar, and falls on the earth at his feet. Uril. Oh, mercy! mercy! [The curtain falls. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Gothic Gallery in the Castle of Fredolfoâ Fredolfo and Berthold discoveredâFredolfo seated, and much exhaustedâBerthold standing by him, and watching him with malignant delight. Fred. (after a pause.) Ay,âthus it must beâthis is meet and fitting.â A woman's shrieks must be as music to me,â Her agony's clasp I must like trophies sport with, Must watch her writhings with an eye of stone, And bid my slaves, who shudder at their task, âUntwine that worm, and fling it far from me.â It was my child, my fond and lovely childâ My child whom I should loveâwhom I have lovedâ Whom I do love with all a father's yearnings;â And her I spurn'dâRightâI shall be in time A fine accomplish'd villain, rude and ruthless! [turning to Berthold. What scowl'st thou on, with thy portentous smile, Passing like lightning, o'er thy stormy visage? It is some evil, or thou couldst not smile! Bert. (with bitter irony.) I mark with awe the patriot's private moments; These are thy triumphs, Virtue, view, and boast them! [suddenly changing. Oh! what a fool is the brute multitude, To shout âa God!â before this hollow image! Ha! ha! ha! things are well balanced here;â The evening's groan repays the morning's boast. Vice were too humble, but for scenes like these, And hopeless Villainy, lacking such solace, Would turn an anchorite for very sadness! Fred. Thou tool of wrath, which, while I grasp, I shudder, Though one wild moment's sudden agony Made me a fiend, I am a man again.â I would not harm that youth for many worlds; Go, and release the prisoner. Bert. (Drawing his dagger, and pointing to it with significant gesture.) Thus, perchance?â Fred. (Giving him a key.) No, villain, thusâbid him be free, and live! Bid him, if possible, forgetâif not, Let him revengeâI'm weary of the struggle! Bert. Thou weak of purpose, whom the tool thou scorn'st Scorns in its turn, in soul, if not in tongue,â With keen and breathless speed thy rage hath chased This youth from shore to shoreâThe chase is o'er,â He pants i'th'toils, he gasps beneath thy fangsâ And now thou say'st, âGo, set the prisoner free.â Success in crime makes men half deem it virtue,â Thy weak and partial virtue's half a crime!â [Seeing Fredolfo moved, he urges him more strongly. 'Tis but a blow! he is unarm'd and helpless,â Even this weak frame might do the work upon him, Grasp his white neck with these lean bony fingers,â Plant this distorted knee upon his breast,â There, like the night-fiend, sit in grinning triumph, And watch the gasp, and drink the death-choked howl! Fred. (struck with horror.) Away! begone! and for thy bitterest penance, Incarnate devil, do one deed of goodness! Bert. (absorbed in malignity, and not heeding him.) I could, such is my heart's o'erflowing spleen To all that loved, and lovely areâmethinks, I could, even with a look,âas thusâdart through him The basilisk's eye-fangâdying on the throe! Fred. (Incensed beyond patience, and going up to him fiercely, then recollecting himself.) Slaveâbut I am thy slaveâhence, hence, I say!â And move me not to do thee some fell outrage. Bert. (going reluctantly, then returning with a sneer.) Would'st thou not do the gentle deed thyself? Fred. (stamping furiously.) Hence! hence! [Exit Berthold. (with much agitation.) I am enthrall'd to one, who wreaks on me A dÃ¦mon's mockery, and a dÃ¦mon's malice.â âFaith, gratitude are gone; gone is the tie âThat darkly binds the guilty to the guiltyâ âThe iron chain they can nor break nor gild; âThe fearful sympathy of minds unblest âCommuning in the darkness of their purposes.â The power to torture is the link that binds him,â Faithful,âbut not for meâhe's sternly faithful To the fix'd malice of his hellish nature;â He goadsâhe lashes me, then checks at will My tortured speed, to urge the lash again. Why does he linger thus?âWhat, if he dareâ I'll go myself,âwith my own hands release him. [retreating with great horror. His memory hath slumber'd from a boy,â But, quicken'd by his wrongs, it may revive;â Oh! on the mind of man, by many feelings And varying interests cross'd, the effaced traces Of memory shift, as time's wave washes them; But childhood, on its single, first impression Dwells with fond strength, though all its powers beâpain! I dare not see himâon my mortal foe Be my front bentâbut not on him I've injured. Berthold enters slowly, approaches, and stands beside him. Bert. 'Tis done! Fred. (starting) What's done? there is some evil done: Whene'er I hear thy stepâI feel a shudder; Whene'er I hear thy voiceâI fear a crime. Bert. What thou'dst have doneâset free thine enemy, To tell his tale of horror through the world. Like a slipp'd beagle from the leash he sprung, To bay with deep-mouth'd yell thy infamy, 'Till the roused welkin answer him again, And all the hunter's spears are turn'd on thee. Fred. (after a long pause) He knows it notâ'Twas nightâHe was a childâ(a pause.) âYears, years have pass'dâthe thought could haunt me only âIn the dark wilds of guilt, where all is fear.â Bert. If 'tis unknown, what shakes Fredolfo's soul? Fred. (with a burst of agony) I know itâIâFredolfo knows it all! Assembled worlds are dumb when conscience speaks; The thunder sleeps, the lightning's glance is mark'd not;â The single criminal, the silent judge, Are all creation's infinite range contains. There needs no mortal witness in that court, âNo eye that watches, and no tongue that speaks; âTo him that writhes in guilt's fine sense of torment âThe breeze, the dew, the fugitive clouds of heaven, âMemorials traced with pen of iron bear; âAll earth is conscious, and all air is voice, âQuick with one feeling, vocal with one sound.â His look of innocence is hateful to me. What must I feel, then, when I gaze on thee? Thou dream of fear embodiedâguilt's fell haunterâ Thou night-mare of the oppressed sight, on whom Deformity ran wanton!âYes, she snatch'd The page where Nature would have written man, And madly scrawl'd it with a pictured devil! The view of Adelmar recalls my crimeâ The sight of thee inflicts my punishment! Bert. If that my presence be so odious to thee, Give me a gift of price, and let me part. Fred. Thou know'st my fallen stateâbut thou'lt rejoice, (he pauses.) To save my child from Wallenberg's fell love I have resign'd mine office in the state, Hiding my head beneath this roof of horrors. No hoarded gold, no gem of price is mineâ Yet, take the ancient jewels of mine house, Clasp from my robe, and signet from my hand, So thou wilt part! Bert. I covet not thy goldâthou hast a daughter! Fred. (waking, as from a dream, and going up to him) I did not hear thee, sure! Bert. (viewing him calmly) Thou hast a daughter! The maiden is right scornfulâbut she's duteous; Her smiles will follow where her father points. Fred. (rushing at him furiously) Slaveâdamned wretch, and slave! Bert. (repelling him fiercely) Patience, proud lord! Not one step farther, or thou'lt wake a fiendâ Mine arm is pithless, but my will is strong! (Fredolfo stands gasping.) Thou slave, who fear'st thy slave, thou wretch, more wretched Than him thy pride would spurn, and spurning, rouse, Stand where thou art, and stand without a murmur, Bent brow, or writhen lip, or eye that curses, Or with a word, I strike theeâworse than dead! (Pointing to him bitterly.) Is that the patriotâheroâgodâFredolfo? Methinks he waxeth paleâthe idol nodsâ He totters on his pedestalâhe falls! Ha, ha, ha!âfalls at his vassal's feet! Fred. (sinking on his knees with terrible agitation) Shriek through the public streets, I am a murderer: Seize on my throat, and drag me forth to justiceâ But do notânoâthou dar'st not think of her! Bert. I dare not! O, thou know'st not what I dare. What dares not he whom nature's self hath cursed, And who retorts her curse upon her minions; Blasts beauty, scoffs at truth, makes mock at agony, And laughs and tramples 'mid the wreck he wrought? Fred. Torture meâtrample on meâspare my child!â Thou must have pity on a father's agony, Albeit no child hath ever called thee father; Revel, thou fiend, in my lost paradise, But spare the flower I loved before I fell! Bert. (significantly, and going) You trust me with your life, but not your daughter. Fred. (in terror) My life! my life!â Bert. (with sternness) Fredolfo, come to judgment! The summoner's voice hath call'dâthe judges trembleâ Who is the murderer? Fred. (seizing him furiously) Villain, here he stands;â He grasps thy throat! Bert. (struggling) Another murder! wellâ Fred. (shuddering) Murder!âno, wretch, vile as thou art, the dungeonâ Struggle notâshriek notâ(drawing him off.) Bert. Help, ho! help for life! [They struggle. (A horn sounds without, then a burst of martial music.) Fred. Whence was that blast? Waldo and attendants enter in haste. Wal. My lord, my lord! the governor Wallenberg, All by an arm'd and gallant train attended, Stands at the castle-gate. Fred. (with great terror) Count Wallenberg! What means this visit? Wallenberg!âadmit him! (much agitation.) Why gaze ye on me thus? Begone! admit him! [Exeunt Waldo and attendants. He must not see me thus!âOh! shame, and horror! Let me wipe off the death-damps from my browâ (Turning to Berthold.) Villain! remember, if againâNo more! Enter Wallenberg, attended by a splendid train, his air haughty and contemptuous. Through the whole of the scene Fredolfo resumes and retains his dignity. Berthold, when Fredolfo turns from him, follows him with a look of diabolical malignity. Wall. Hail to Fredolfo! With a friend's free boldness We press upon his midnight solitude To claim a welcome. Fred. (very coldly) Sir, you honour me; 'Tis honour all unmeet for this poor roof, To house such lordly guest as Wallenberg. Wall. (with irony) Lightly I hold such heartless festalry; Give me a courtly, friendly host like thee; The long and eager clasp of outstretch'd hands; (A pauseâkeener irony.) Such welcome as Fredolfo's greeting gives; Such smile as hovers on Fredolfo's lips! (Exulting in Fredolfo's emotion.) Give me thy handâin faith I love thee much! Fred. Not from unbidden guest can I withhold it. There, sir! [Gives his hand, with reluctant dignity. Wall. (looking round him) In sooth, my lord Fredolfo, Your fancy boasts a nice and curious taste, To fly the ample, cheerful domes of Altdorf, And on St. Gothard's wild and naked peak To battle with the eagle for his eyry, And wrest your rude meal from the famish'd wolf! (Looking round him with increasing scorn.) A mansion rear'd to spite the elements, To struggle with the storm for doubtful safety, And hold its trembling tenure from the blast. Fred. It hath a charm the stranger knoweth not:â It is the dwelling of mine ancestry; There is an inspiration in its shade; The echoes of its vaults are eloquent,â They speak of the glorious dead! Its tenants are not humanâthey are more! The stones have voices, and the walls do live:â It is the house of memories, dearly honour'd By many a trace of long departed glory; Honour'd by dead and livingâhonour'd most (with dignified contempt) By Wallenberg's light scorn, and scorned lightness! Wall. Nay, nay, be not thus moody, aged lordâ In faith, I scorn to chafe plebeian pride.â Ay, struggle as thou wilt through storm and darkness, Feed, worm-like, on thy legendary parchments, Watch cobwebs grow, and cherish the pale mildewâ But thou hast a fair daughterâ Fred. (after a struggle) Sir!âproceed. Wall. And must that lovely lady linger here, Shedding her pined beauties on the waste, Like flower, that in the dark vale dies for woe, At seeing not the sun? It must not be! I'll lead her to the city's gay resort, Where noble knights and courtly ladies be, And high-plumed gallants in their bravery! And gems, and torches bright, and ladies' eyes, Shed luxury of light, and teach cold maids Mildly to listen to the tale of love. Fred. (struggling with emotion, then calm) Count Wallenberg!âthis roof is your protection. Wall. I read the language of that flashing eye, And could defy itâBut, by Heaven you wrong me! I gazed upon the maid with lawless love; But my loose days of dalliance are gone by. Fredolfo, hear me!âFriend, or foe, I reck notâ Spite of the pride that burns upon my cheek, Spite of the blood, whose cold recoiling drops Refuse to flow ere they would mix with thine; Spite of our nations, natures, hearts averse, Of all that makes me shudder while I sue,â I claim thy daughter's hand! Fred. My daughter's hand! Ho! call my daughter hitherâWallenberg, I answer notâherself shall answer thee! [Looking off the stage. My daughter waits you, count, and speed your wooing! [Retires. Wall. (watching her approach) She comes with all that shrinking bashfulness, The eloquence of motion,âmute, but felt. The air around her breathes of purity; And, as she moves, her equal tread's fine impulse Falls on the ear like harmony;âthe light That gleams on her fair locks and slender form Crowns them with hallowed glory, like some vision To saintly eyes reveal'd!âShe is a thing To knee and worship. Beauty hath no lustre, Save when it gleameth through the crystal web That Purity's fine fingers weave for it; And then it shows like Venus from the wave, The fresh drops clinging to her beauty still! Urilda enters. Lady, your fair hand!âsuffer me to press Love's true kiss on itâpaying with glad lips The debt that lovers to their ladies owe. Uril. (very coldly) My lord, your presence in my father's halls Warrants a gentle maiden's courtesy; As such, I pray, accept this meet obeisance. Wall. I am not wont to woo in suppliant strain, Nor form'd to languish at a lady's feet, In such sad guise as smooth-cheek'd striplings use; I woo thee like a man:âI love thee, lady! Start not, nor tremble; Thou, only, could'st subdue a soul like mineâ A soul that, even in softness, half regrets Its former liberty, and scorns its weakness: My vanquish'd pride's a victim to my heart,â The proud reluctant slave is worth the conqueror. Uril. My lord, perchance a harder task remains, To conquer mineâMy father, speak for me! [Turning away. Fred. (Coldly.) Urilda, speak thyselfâthy father's presence Gives thee protection, but suspends control. Banish the tremblings of thy maiden coyness, Answer, my child, this noble, courteous wooer. Uril. (Advancing.) Then, thus:âAround my shrunk and faded form Wrap the dim veil that mortal touch withdraws not;â âFold me in the pale votarist's vestal's stole,â âAy,âin the mendicant's foul weeds of wretchedness;â âAy,âin the earthy and worm-dropping shroud;ââ Before ye deck me in the bridal robe, And place my wedded hand in Wallenberg's. [Falls into her father's arms. Wall. Am I awake!âand does a rustic girl, The low-descended daughter of scorn'd peasants With blood no richer than the mountain stream, Spurn the proud hand outstretch'd to raise her? Thou toy, whom in mine hour of fond insanity Madly I prized, I fling thy lightness from me, As the heal'd maniac, glancing round his cell, Scoffs at the straw his dream of frenzy gilded!â Oh! that I could from my dishonour'd life Pluck this foul night of shame! Mark me, proud girl! Thy folly's penance shall o'erpay thy lover's.â I loathe the hour of weakness when I knelt; But thou shalt curse the hour I knelt in vain! Fred. (Incensed.) Count Wallenberg!â Uril. My fatherâOh, my father! I had not thought to speak, but this proud insult Unchains the maiden shame that binds my tongue. I am a mountain-girl, in whose free veins Rolls the rich blood of heroes! Men, who scorning To rule their country, only sought to bless it! The spirits of the great are strong within me, They prompt me now,âthey urge my trembling tongue To tell thee, that this weak and female hand, Ere it clasp one red with my country's blood, Would clutch with eager hold Death's bony fingers; And this proud heart, big with its country's feeling, Would burst this cincture, ere its throbbings press'd Against a bosom swelling with fell purposes.â My father's foe,âmy country's,âand my God's! No, Wallenberg!âno, Austrian!ânever!ânever!â âSeek thou thy mate amid proud Austria's dames, âThe daughter of the mountains spurns thy hand.â [Sinks into her father's arms. Fred. Thou art my daughterânever loved as nowâ Thou mountain-maid,âthou child of liberty! Urilda! Well from Uri's height I named thee, Free as its breezes,âpurer than its snows!â [A pause. Count Wallenberg, you have my daughter's answer. Wall. (Furiously.) Away!âmy train,âmy steed!âaway this hour! [Coming up to Urilda, with irony. Grieve not for my departure, gentle maid; I shall return again,âreturn full soon, But, not as wooers come.âMy lord Fredolfo, I thank you for your splendid, noble courtesy, And thus I pledge my hand, and pledge my soul, My foot shall pause not, nor my thoughts have rest, Nor mine eyes close, nor my dry lip taste food, Till with all implements of furious will, Intensest wit, deadly, heart-nested vengeance, And zeal of hate, I've wrought you full repayment. Fred. (Retiring calmly.) Rail to the winds, chafed lord,âthey may regard thee. Look up, Urilda; tremble not, my child! Wall. Hell and its furies burn within me! [Draws his sword, and rushes at Fredolfo. Urilda screams, and darts between them. Uril. Ah! [Fredolfo's attendants gather roundâa tumult âWallenberg disarmed. Fred. (Calmly.) Give him his sword againâlet fall your weapons! By heaven, I smite to earth the arm that's raisedâ He is beneath my roof. Throw wide the gates. Count Wallenberg, you may depart in safety. [Exit, leading out Urilda, who sinks on him, exhausted. Wall. Hence! let me plunge into the night's thick gloom, Pierce the dark forest,âin the cavern hide me, If that their darkness may conceal my shame. [Rushing out; he is detained by Berthold, who clings to him. Bert. One moment, noble Wallenberg, one moment! Wall. What worm art thou, that twin'st around my knees? Hence! or I spurn thee! Bert. Spurn me not, dread lord,â I am a worm, whose sting can pierceâFredolfo. (More eagerly, as Wallenberg listens.) There is a deed, untold to mortal ear, There is a thing, unthought by mortal minds,â A thing of guilt, of horror, and of shame, And him that wrought it only Berthold knows! Wall. There is a glowing malice in thy visage,â There is a kindling devil in thine eye,â Go onâI do believe theeâtell thy tale. Bert. Secure my lifeâI am Fredolfo's vassalâ Secure my safety first! Wall. His vassal, say'st thou? If thou can'st evil of Fredolfo tell, I will unto my breast, with friendly clasp, Hug thy deformity;âthou shalt be great, Be robed in silk, and lodged in palacesâ Beauty shall smile on thee, and thou on high Shalt stand among the nobles of the land, So thou wilt show but evil of Fredolfo! Bert. I ask not thatâI ask a lighter boon. Wall. Ask what thou wilt, it shall be granted thee! (Berthold approaching very slowly, and whispering.) Bert. Thy father perish'd by a hand unknown, But not to all. Wall. My fatherâperished! speak! Bert. (Whispering.) The brand that pierced the breast of Wallenberg Hung in the sheath ofâHa! Enter Fredolfo. Fred. (With calm dignity.) Count Wallenberg, I had forgot the duties of a host;â O'er the wild mazes of our mountain tracks Ten of my boldest vassals shall conduct you.â Depart in safety, guided by the care Of him against whose breast your arm was raised. Wall. (With irony.) Most generous, noble host; I shall depart, And take with me a sure and faithful guide, Who will my swift and ready steps conduct Through mazes darker than your mountain-tracks.â (Suddenly advancing, and with emphasis.) I claim your vassal, Berthold, for my guide! Fred. (Horror struck.) Ha! Bert. (Going up to him with a sneer.) Farewell, my lordâyour duteous vassal leaves you. [A pause. [Fredolfo recovers, and gives his hand to him with a mixed emotion, arising from a wish to conceal his agitation from Wallenberg, and a faint hope to excite compassion in Berthold. Fred. (Slowly.) Farewell. Wall. (Significantly.) Farewell, my lord Fredolfo! Ho! Berthold,âfollow me! [As they go out, Fredolfo, losing all self-command, rushes after Berthold with a wild attempt; Berthold gives him a look of malignity; Wallenberg turns on him, with affected surprise, mixed with disdain; Fredolfo, in an agony, throws himself into the arms of his own attendants. Fred. Lost! lost! Oh God, for ever! (He is conveyed off.) [Exeunt Wallenberg and Berthold, triumphantly. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A wild Forest Scene: Fredolfo's Castle and St. Gothard in the back ground. Time, evening. Fredolfo enters, lost in meditation; he is silent for some time, then starts on looking round him and discovering where he is. Fred. Where am I now?âWhere have my wanderings led me? It is the scene!âthat bare and blasted pineâ It is the hour!âthat pale and stormy twilightâ It is the spot!âI yet could count the blood-drops.â (Staggering with horror, as he traces every distinct spot.) Here long he strove,âand still I grappled with him,â And here I fell with him,âin horror roll'd;â Here his strong foot-stamps tore the bloody earth up! Here the trail'd corse track'd every step with gore,â The demon, Berthold, grinning at his burden! And hereâHark! hark!âa voiceâa stepâa spy!â Waldo enters, and Fredolfo turns on him very sternly. Fred. âWhat makes thee wandering here so late? Wal. âI sought you. Fred. âSought me, and wherefore, sir? am I that thing âMy slaves must watch, and say â'tis vesper time, âAnd you must hie you home?ââwhat is't to thee âIf here I linger'd seeking home no more?â Wal. âOh quit, my lord, this lonely fearful place! Fred. (Starting.) âWhat is there in its gloom of loneliness, âThat should suggest that wish? Wal. âI know not, sir! Fred. âNor I,âbegone! Wal. âThese lone and nightly walks âDo much impair your strength. Fred. (with gloomy carelessness.) âIt is no matter. Wal. âCount Wallenbergâ Fred. âBegone, or I shall hate thee; name his name, âAnd the loud echo of these pines shall curse thee, Being of mountains bornâaway, begone!â Let the dew fall, or let the tempest rave, To me it recks not. Slave! must I bid twice? Fred. (Alone, looking after Waldo.) He knows itâyes, he knows it!â'tis no matterâ The world must know it.âBertholdâayâhis image Darts like an adder in my mental path, Where'er I turn my thoughts.âYears, years, have fleeted,â The deed is deadâthe slumbering world forgetsâ The tide of time sweeps by, and in its murmurs Has drown'd suspicion's whisper.âAll is safeâ But Berthold lives in vivid consciousness, The wakeful demon of the buried secret, Watching the hour when vengeance reads the spell: He livesâhe knowsâhe hatesâand he betrays! âFiend form'd in wrath to urge and lash the crime! âI saw the burning malice of thy glance, âI saw the hellish menace of thy scowl, âI felt the thunder of thy parting tread, âThat parting told of meeting soonâand terrible!â (Pausing and looking round. A burst of military music.) (With great horror.) Wherefore is this? if it be Wallenbergâ If?âif?âthere is nor doubt, nor hopeâ'tis he! Enter Berthold. Bert. (Sneeringly.) Hail, noble sir!âmy lord, Count Wallenberg, Would crave a moment's audience of your leisure, On matters that concern the state's behoof. Fred. (Beginning the speech with assumed dignity, and then losing all self-command.) Say to your lordâno matterâgo, thou wretch! I can bear aught but thy abhorred sight! Enter Wallenberg, Knights, and military Attendants. Wall. (with irony throughout.) Once more a late and uninvited guest, I press upon Fredolfo's privacy;â In faith, my lord, your ample, noble usage Shames a way-worn and humble traveller;â You scorn above your guests to spread a canopy Less spacious than the heavens, or yield them hangings Less richly wrought than those pine-skirted rocks.â Berthold, thou know'st his moodâI pray thee, tell him That wandering knights his mountain-palace seek All in the twilight pale, and pray him dear, For knighthood's sake, to do them courtesy. [A look of triumphant consciousness to pass between Wallenberg and Berthold. Bert. (Approaching Fredolfo.) My lord Fredolfo, you have heard my message;â Throw wide your ample halls; within their range There are strange objects of peculiar interest, Which sure yon noble traveller fain would see! Fred. (Turning on him.) Sirâto your lord I answer:âWallenberg, Your arm, last night, was raised against my life; If through yon gates, unshrinking, you can passâ If on my halls unblushing you can tread, Enter;âbut, to your proud luxurious train My mountain-hut will prove a homely hostel. Wall. We will not trespass on your bounty yet;â I would inhale this free and mountain air, Whose impulse to the soaring soul doth lend Pure inspiration,â'mid whose holy waftings To breathe is to be virtuous!âO, my lord, How sweet, while wandering 'mid these solemn shades, To commune with your clear and lofty spirit,â What recollections follow youâ Fred. (Starting.) My lord!â Wall. What high associations!âdoubtless, here, From every pine a kindred spirit whispers, And every turf you tread thrills as you touch it With grateful memory of some glorious action. Fred. Sirâof your praise I reck notâmy fallen country, Amid her ruins, may remember one Whose single arm upheld the pile, and last, Amid its shivering fragments, rear'd its strength, Till nought was left to save!âOf your wild words, Or of their unsought meaning, sir, I am Unheeding as unconscious! Wall. Be not chafed! Treat not thus roughly guests, who, all for love, Through the dim, perilous, and stormy eve, Have breathless spurred to bear you joyful tidings. Fred. Tidings, my lord? Wall. Yes,âtidings, honoured sir! And glorious tidings for the patriot's ear, When lurking crime is dragg'd from its foul hold! There are tidings, sir, in Altdorfâthe proud city Is full of busy murmurs;âin her streets, Men grasp each other's hands, as each had found Their heart's best wishes,âjoying that the search Hath ceasedâthe man of blood at last is found! Fred. (Trembling.) The man of blood is found!â Wall. My father's murderer, Thou knowest, hath through long years been vainly sought. Fred. (Much agitated.) I mustâI do remember very wellâ Wall. The murderer of Wallenberg is tracedâ [Pauses long, fixing his eye on Fredolfo, whose emotion is visible. The murderer of Wallenberg is knownâ [Again. The murderer of Wallenberg is seized!â [Rushes on him. Here, take him, guards, and drag him to your dungeons! [Giving him to the guards. Fred. (Struggling.) This unsupported chargeâthis lawless outrageâ Off, slaves!âProud Austrian, at your peril be itâ This matchless insult!âhave I then no friend? No brand of follower raised in my defence? Beneath the shade of mine own native towers, Like gyved felon, am I helpless dragg'd, No arm to aid, no voice to plead for me?â Bert. Let not my lord thus call for hopeless aid, While Berthold's zealous duty waits unclaim'd! Mine be the voice whose sounds shall whisper peace,â Mine be the arm whose help is sure and speedy. Wall. Away, thou gibing fiend, with thy vile mockery, Crush not the fallen victim.âMurderer, We bind the chain around thy doomed body, And summon thee to meet thy mortal judgment! Urilda rushes in. Uril. (Shrieking.) Hold, hold, for mercy! 'tis his daughter kneels, O, ye are human, though ye look not so!â Wallenbergâand my father!âfetters! guards! What is this fearful dream? Wall. It is no dreamâ Wake from thy trance of pride, vain girl, and know I grasp the chain that drags him to the scaffold! Fred. Why art thou here? Uril. Dark men look sternly on thee, Thy hands are boundâand dost thou ask thy child, âWhy art thou here!â Wall. 'Twere well, fair maid, to spare This lavish luxury of sorrowing beauty.â Wring thy white hands before the judgment seat; Spread thy bright locks like hovering angel's plumes When the axe trembles o'er thy father's head;â Perchance the hoary Syndics then may weep;â Perchance the headsman's quivering hand may pause Ere the blow falls upon that murderer's neck.â Uril. Murderer!âmy father!â Villain! and liar!âO! I feel unsex'd! O, that this hand were in a gauntlet mail'd, And I would fearless down thy slanderous throat Dash the foul falsehood.âSpeak, my father, speak! O, the bright energy of conscious truth, The pure clear light of thy most cloudless soul, Will sink these baffled slaves to earth before thee, And turn this shame to worship.âFather, speak! Wall. Ay! let him speak! [They all gather round himâHe stands paralyzed with horror among them. Bert. Speak, noble, injured lord, And dart conviction on our dazzled souls! Uril. Away! ye harass himâhe'll list to meâ He doth not know your voices.âFather! Father! One word,âthose chains from your freed hands shall fall,â One word,âthese slaves are prostrate at your feet. Speak! Speak! (shrieking with agony.) Fred. Lead on! [Falls senseless in the arms of the Guard. Uril. (struggling.) Ye shall not tear him from me!â Stay!âhe will speak anonâhe is overpower'd! [She kneels between Wallenberg and Berthold, supplicating them alternately, with desperate and hopeless eagerness. Berthold! thou wast his vassalâplead for me! Wallenberg!âthou didst woo me;âlook on me! None, none will hear me!âhe, even he is deaf! A dungeonâGod! my father in a dungeon! Dragâdrag him thereâbut I must follow him! [She is dragged off, clinging to Fredolfo, who remains senseless. SCENE II. Altdorf; Picturesque buildings in the Gothic styleâThe Prison in perspectiveâAustrian Guards, repelling the Swiss who fill the streets âAdelmar in disguise among them. Swiss. (To an Austrian, who is driving him back.) I pray thee now, good ruffian, spurn me not! I will stand here right patiently, to see Mine ancient master to a prison borne, And to mine home bear back a broken heart. Adel. Who art thou that speakest kindly of Fredolfo? Swiss. And who art thou, that of a free-born Swiss Asks if he loves Fredolfo? Adel. Can ye love him, And see him clutch'd in their foul, damned grasp? The stones do heave and quiver at his tread, Yet ye are mute and motionless! The walls are trembling where the champion walks His way to shameâyet ye no feeling have! The very air seems tortured by the echo That answers to his name of infamy! Yet ye in silence hear the withering sound, And gape with idiot stare upon the pageant. Swiss. What should we do? Adel. What should you do!âMy voice is in my brand! 2d Swiss. And who art thou, who 'mid the people that love him, Forcest thyself, unknown, unsought, unsummon'd? Adel. I am a man Fredolfo hates;âa man Fredolfo persecutes;âyet I am he, Who with bare arm and single sword do press Amid his native city's thronged streets, Lifting my sole hand like a war-worn banner, Which no band gathers round. Swiss. (shouting.) It does! It does! [They gather round him tumultuously. Enter Fredolfo in chains, supported by Urildaâ A mixed crowd of Soldiers, Peasantry, and Citizens follow tumultuously. Uril. (Triumphantly.) See how they gather round theeâproudly gather, As in the day of battleâhow they hang Upon thy looks, as in the hall of judgment, When speech was eloquence, and judgment truth! God bless you, brave and faithful hearts!âGod bless you! Fred. (much agitated.) And who are ye who proudly press around me? âBend ye those arms against the heart of justice âOr against mine? if here, let them be buried: âPerchance their aim is just. My countrymen, âTo the strong battle I have led you! baffled âFrom its dread brunt have I e'er shrunk? Ye're silent!â My countrymen! on your dear loves I callâ Not on your arms!âOn the awful front of justice Bend not thy hostile frownâI am a manâ Perchance an erringâ(pauses) Innocent, or guilty, Heaven's arm alone can right meâYours are nought! Dash down those brandsâthen to your homes, my countrymen! There fight with other weaponsâkneel, and prayâ Pray that a sinful soulâall souls are sinfulâ I will not burden yeâa pleading angel Stands by my side, and soothes, and strengthens me! I do not need your prayers. [Sinks on Urilda. Enter Wallenberg and Austrians, Guards, &amp;c. Wall. Whatâlingering still? Away with him to the dungeon! Dost thou take pride to tread these streets in shame, A fetter'd felon, courting vile compassionâ Clanking thy chains to the accordant howl Of wither'd beldams, and gross, gaping burghers? Away with him!âAnd ye, coarse knaves, begone! Your hero hath changed his temple for a dungeon! By heaven, they loiter! Fred. Hence, depart, my friends! I have no powerâbut I have still a voiceâ âA voice that near your country's banner peal'd âLike thunder round a spread and floating cloud.â Hear its last cry:âdepartâFredolfo asks it! (The crowd disperse.) Wall. And Wallenberg commands it! Drag him hence! Hence! to the prison with him in their sight! Uril. Come then, to prisonâthough no breath of heaven Shall fan our brows, their thrilling pores shall ne'er Be damp, like thine, with horror's livid dews! The stone must pillow us; but shriek like that Which turns thy doom to fire shall ne'er assail us. Fetters must bind those limbs that sanctify themâ Their iron shall not enter to the soul, Like those a tyrant's crimes have forged for thee! (To Fred.) Why dost thou droop on those abhorred chains? Cheerly, my noble fatherâheed it notâ It was a passing agonyâ'tis o'er! [Struggling to dry her tears, and exit, leading out her father. (Wallenberg stalks triumphantly across the stage, viewing them with scorn as they retire.) Wall. Oh! it will be a demon-luxury To watch the throes of her expiring pride, Beneath fear's mortal graspâthen, then, to see herâ Her tears, her tresses, white and clasped hands, And heaving bosom, heaving at my knee, In weeping beauty's bright profusion wild! There's not a bloody page I will not turn With burning study, so that I may wreak Their full-collected pangs upon Fredolfo, While that pale shrieking girl stands witness by! Berthold rushes in. Bert. Waste not another moment, 'Twas heâ'twas heâUrilda's dark-hair'd minionâ The youth for whom she spurns theeâ'twas his voice, Even now, that stirr'd the crowd to mutinyâ And he hath 'scaped us! Wall. 'Scaped us? no, he must not, Though he were borne beyond the reach of man, I know a lure shall charm him to the snare, Urilda's voice shall soothe, betray, and doom him! When those we hate become our tools of vengeance, Its work is perfect:âProud and wretched girl, When the strain'd balls of agony shall wander From a sire's corse, and rest upon a lover's,â Then, then, remember Wallenberg was scorn'd! [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Interior of a Prison. Enter Fredolfo, leaning on Urilda. Attendants belonging to the Prison. Atten. (with compassion) Please you, my lord, rest here. Fred. (not heeding him) I thank thee, it is very well! Atten. The air, I fear, blows chilly through that grating. Fred. Perchance it doesâI do not feel it yet! Atten. Will you not rest upon this matted couch? Fred. (sits down, holding Urilda) I thought I had, even nowâI crave your pardonâ Where is my daughter? Uril. I am hereâI'm here! Clasping your dear hand, clinging to your neck. Will you not look at me? Fred. The place is darkâ Mine eyes are dim o' the suddenâthings look strangelyâ But you will pardon meâand all is well. Uril. (weeping) Oh! rend not mine heart in twain! My friends, depart! [Exeunt attendants. Fred. (anxiously) There is a thick and heavy breathing here, The very air seems shackled:â It comes o'er me like an embracing prisoner,â Who, in his salutation, feels his chain Grate on the breast he clasps. Uril. It is not so! The air through yon light grating blows full pleasantly. Fred. Urilda, this dark air hath been empoison'd By many a murderer's breath. Uril. But thine shall consecrate itâthine, my father! Oh! future sufferers here shall sit in pride, Shall hug the chains that now I clasp in agony, And proudly say, when from its horrid walls They tread, âI have been in Fredolfo's dungeon!â Fred. Away! many a murderer shall here abide! Dally not with my chainsâthou canst not break them. Uril. Thy country's arm shall break them! Fred. A mightier arm (pointing to heaven) Alone can break the chain that binds the soul! Sit downâand if thou wilt on subjects talk That hold alliance with this horrid place, I'll talk of such to thee.â There was a man, I knew him once, I thought, But even his daughter would not know him now. Uril. It cannot beâhis daughter still must know him. Fred. He was unhappyâ Uril. Then she loved him better! Fred. Butâhe was guilty! Uril. Oh! impossible! A father guilty in his daughter's eyes! Fred. I must go on. That wretched man, through years of misery, Had gone to where the guilty meet their fateâ None knew the thought that brought him there; perchance They deem'd it pity!âNoâhe watch'd in anguish How the pale wretch did on the scaffold stareâ Becauseâand if he had a daughterâthenâ (Pauses in dreadful agitation, then proceeding with great difficulty, and sometimes glancing at Urilda, who sits by him in progressive and horrible stupefaction.) The night came onâbeside his couch of stone His daughter satâas now thou dost by meâ (Another pauseâshe looks at him long, without speaking.) (Pointing upwards) There was a dungeon o'er themâits dark vaults A merciful shadow on his damp brow cast, And she, who came with heart as light as thine, (She lets go hold of his chains.) Clasping her father's chains in triumphâ When she did hear that father's tale of crime,âdropp'd them! Uril. (after a pause) But then she smiled upon himâdid she not? Or tried to smile? (forcing a convulsive smile.) Fred. (tossing his chains in sudden agony) I am a murderer! Uril. (starting from him, and bursting into a horrible laugh) My father! and a murderer! Ha, ha, ha! (Recovering and going up to him tenderly, and hanging on him.) Nay, do not try me soâthou speak'st in jestâ But try me so no more! [Hides her head in his breast. Fred. IâI have spoken! Uril. (struggling with him in desperation) Retractâretract! for Heaven'sâfor mercy's sake! Fred. Horrible truth! (She rushes away from him, and remains at a great distance, gazing on him with a look of horror.) Fred. (holding out his arm to her) My child! my child! if crime like mine may plead Extremest wrong, and passion urged to madnessâ These fetters will not plead to thee in vain;â She will not speakâshe will not listen to meâ My child and nature have abandoned me! Uril. (flying into his arms and clasping him) Oh no!âno!âno!âthey have not! Fred. (quite exhausted) Leave meâleave me! There is, perchance, a nook in this dark dwelling, Where I may, trembling, supplicate for mercy Aloneâfor in this moment's agony, Even thineâthy sight is painful to mine eyes! [He retires slowly to a recess in the prison. (Urilda remains alone, fixed and stupified, in the front of the stage.) Wallenberg enters silently, and approaches herâ she does not see him till he is close to herâ she then starts, and clings to him, with a dreadful scream. Uril. Save him, oh! save him! Thou alone canst save him! Wall. Why this appealing shriekâthis frantic claspâ These lifted handsâthis prostrate agony? What does Fredolfo's daughter seek from me? You shrink, you turn away, you veil your faceâ What! is it possible? Speakâanswer meâ Is he then guilty? Is your father guilty? Speak! I must hear the wordâyour father guilty?â Uril. (falling on the ground) He isâmy father! Wall. Prostrate at my feet! The flower that scorn'd the touch must court the treadâ Rise, lady, rise! you much debase yourself To clasp the knees of a rejected wooer! Uril. (writhing at his feet in agonizing humiliation) Let not my gracious lord in wrath remember The frantic folly of a wayward girl! Wall. (with increasing bitterness) And when I trembled at Urilda's feet, What was my answer?ââNever! never! never! No, Wallenbergâno, Austrianânever! never!â Uril. Oh! I was proudâwas madâI did not know That I was the vile thing I'm sunk to now. Wall. I was a villainâliarâwas't not so? Ayâliar was the term! Uril. Oh! noânot soâ How can you crush a worm, to see it writhe? Wall. (changing his whole manner) Urilda, I canâpity, and forgive! Uril. (looking at him, then shuddering) Can you?âOh, never, neverâOh! forgiveâ Can you forgive me? Can you indeed? (clinging to his vest.) Wall. I can, and moreârelieveâ Can give your father liberty and life! Uril. (with convulsive laughter) Life!âliberty! and the poor guilty manâ Blessings, oh blessings! Wall. Holdâtill I deserve them. I dare not, in my duty's awful trust, Rend ope the doors of an arraigned felon; I cannot, as a son, from the loathed arm That slew my father strike the clasping fetter, And say, with horrid gratitude, Kind murderer! You stabb'd my sireâyour guerdon is your liberty! Uril. Well, well, my lordâ(impatiently.) Wall. But, may not this be done? Is there not yet among the patriot's friends Some youth of bold and enterprising arm, Who, with small cost of noisy eloquence, May tempt the rabble on his prison-doors To try their hands' rude strength, and not in vainâ While I to distant quarters lead the Austrians, And leave the pass unguarded? May this be? Uril. (clasping her hands) Oh, heaven! it mayâit may! Wall. Know'st thou of such? Uril. Perchance there may be one. Wall. And one whom thou canst trustâwhom thou couldst love? Uril. My lord! Wall. Oh! summon him! on the instant summon him! Uril. (kissing his hand eagerly) Nay, do not wrest thy generous hand from me! And he shall live?âOh! from our distant home, In poverty, in exile, yea in deathâ How blessings shall steam up like incense for thee! âOh! think of a rich offering of full hearts, âBurning upon an altar lit for thee, âBow'd knees, clasp'd hands, strong, eager, trembling prayers, âThat melt the saints, and take the heavens by storm!â Wall. And he thou lov'stâhe too will pray for me! Uril. My lord! Wall. And may not luckless Wallenbergâ Albeit an exile from your soft retreatâ Steal with light step upon its paradise, Gaze on your slumbers in its bowers of balm, And smile on you, as I do now! Uril. Oh, God! (hiding her face) Not that dread smileâNay, do not turn from meâ Be not incensedâfor my heart is sick With doubts, with bodings, and with many fears. Wall. Thy fears and doubts, ere midnight, shall be endedâ Summon thy friendâprepare thee for the hour! When the bell tolls, remember Wallenberg! Uril. For ever, and for ever, in my prayers! [Kneeling. Fred. (rushing forward) Hold, frantic wretch! he mocks theeâWallenberg! (seizing Urilda's arm.) If thou art here in scorn, I pity theeâ If thou art here in mercy, I disdainâ Uril. (struggling with, and trying to soften Wallenberg) Oh! heed him not! Fred. Heed him not, thou lost girl! (Urilda struggles between them.) I call on Heaven for mercyânot on man! I've lived the champion of my country's rights, I'll die the victim of my country's justice! Wall. (rushing furiously away) Die, and despair! Uril. (clinging to him, as he drags her along) Oh! he must not die! Thou'lt save him yetâthou wiltâthou'rt merciful, Piteous, and goodâI will be thine! (He dashes her from him.) Thou wilt not spurn meâthou hast knelt to meâ Wall. (with horrible irony, repeating his last words as he turns on her, while she kneels) When the bell tolls, remember Wallenberg! Uril. (not understanding the menace) Oh! yesâremember theeâwith blessings! blessings! [Wallenberg rushes out. (She kneels, knocking in agony at the door.) Hear me! Oh, hear me!âOh! the door is closedâ The door of hope is closed!âYet hear me, Wallenberg! [Dashing her head in desperation against the door, then rushing back to her father. (Falling at his feet.) Lost! lost! for ever lost! Fred. (calmly clasping her hand, and pointing to heaven) Not lost for ever!!! [Curtain drops. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A splendid apartment in Wallenberg's palace. A Banquet seen through arches in the back ground. Music. (Wallenberg rushes from the Banquet-room with distracted gesture.) Wall. Break off your minstrelsy. [Music ceases. And must I love her? And must this maddening pulse and feverish heart Beat for her still? for herâCan it be love? Hate's fellest throe were luxury to this! I could rend out the veins that throb for her;â I could on mine own heart fix suicide's fangs, So they defaced that form it dares to cherish! âI dream'd that I had torn her from my bosom; âI dream'dâI knew not that it was Urilda:â âI woke, and found her there. âI feel her in her prostrate beauty still, âHer cold hands twined in mine,âher marble lip âLike that o'er which no breath of life e'er thrill'd; âThe stony fixture of the unpleading eye, âWhen hope's last light is quench'dâthat gazes on âThe fearful eloquence of convulsed limbs, âWhose writhings speak what the choak'd tongue denies. âAway! 'tis follyâvile and loathed folly!â âI will upon my proud rebellious heart âLay the keen stripe of each remember'd wrong, âAnd lash it like a lion into madness.â Did she not spurn me?âThat I could forgive. Did she not shrink from me, as never maiden From wooer shrunk?âEven that I could forgive. Has she not dared to love another?â And can a lover pardon that?âNo, never! My lips can utter ânever!â maiden, tooâ And I can feel that stern, immortal purposeâ That iron thoughtâthat wall of adamantâ That never of the soul, divorcing hope, And stamping fate upon futurity. Enter Berthold hastily. Bert. How hast thou faredâis Adelmar secured? Wall. My fierce and wayward mood hath crossed my will (sullenly). I had upon her fearing credulous heart Wrought the nice work of art,âshe would have fled To the earth's verge for hope and Adelmarâ âShe bless'd me,âthen I pitied her:âshe kiss'd âMy dooming hand, that trembled in her grasp.â Then rush'd that raving dotard from his nookâ His cunning madness foil'd the hopeful snare,â My mood was stirr'dâI cursed them, and I parted.â Do the next feat of wily mischief, thou; I hate, and curse,âbut thou canst curse, and smile! Bert. (derisively) Yeaâsuch a smile as I can spare thee nowâ Thou, who canst let even spleen defeat thy vengeance! Wall. âI was a fool! with sullen spleen I own it. âChide not, or thou may'st feel the wrath thou mockest! âE'en from my boyhood did I loathe the hand âThat proffer'd me a kindnessâmy soul's pride âHad rather met a scorn it could revenge:â âYet I did love,âat that proud maiden's feet âI flung the heart she tramples on. She knew not â'Twas on the adder's slumbering pride she trod. âI hate her!âNeed I seek another causeââ Bert. (looking round) Hush! hush! she comes to seek theeâlinger notâ Thy passion will break forth, and mar mine art. (More eagerly) She shall unto thy bent and thrilling ear Own all her father's crime! Wall. She didâI heard it. Bert. She shall unto thy headsman's bloody stroke Yield the white throat of Adelmarâyea, bless thee, âIn credulous woman's fond unconsciousnessâ For that thy hand doth speed the stroke of death. Wall. Ayâlet him perishâlet me see him perish! My stormy mood would burst thy puny toils, Albeit I need them.âWeave thy web alone, But look thou wind it fast and dark around her. (Looking out towards her.) Thou, whom I know not if I loathe or love,â Who mak'st me tremble with unnamed sensation,â Whom I could clasp, or curse, embrace, or stab; Round whom I could, like the dark serpent, fold, To twine, andâha! to crush thee! [Rushes out. Enter Urilda; she approaches, without knowing Berthold, who has turned away from her, and addresses him as a domestic of Wallenberg. Uril. Turn, turnâin mercy turn, my gracious friend! A wretched suppliant to thy lord's high presence Would win admittance by thy gentle ministry,â Heaven, in thy soul's last need, so deal with thee, As thou dost speed my boon! Bert. (turning on her) What wouldst thou, maiden? Uril. (screaming with horror at his sight) Ah! Berthold!âSerpent! have I trod on thee? And art thou twining round the mercy-seat I fled to cling to?âMercy is not thereâ Forgive, forgive me! (changing.) I must plead to theeâ Thou hast not eat Fredolfo's bread to curse itâ Thou hast not known Fredolfo's heart to pierce it! (Approaching nearer to him.) The blessing of his roof is on thee still, Its holy air hangs round thee, and I feel itâ The sweet breeze of the valley breathes on me! Friend,âservant of my fatherâspurn me notâ The daughter of thy master bends to thee! Bert. (aside) Love knows no luxury like this! (Turning to her) Beshrew me, Fair damsel, but thy sad plight pities me.â Aloneâuntendedâwith dishevell'd locks! And did the nice Urilda, all regardless (irony) Of her state's pride, and of her maiden fame, Traverse at midnight the deserted streets, To woo the audience of a feverish reveller, All too susceptive of fair maiden's charms? Uril. Thou speak'st in mockeryâhadst thou e'er a father? I fear'd for oneâI know no other fear! Bert. Thy father's life hangs trembling on these moments:â Speak! wouldst thou save him? Uril. (with emotion) Would I?â Bert. Sign this scroll, And Adelmar, ere midnight, with strong arm Shall burst thy father's fettersâsign this scroll! Uril. Give it meâbut, oh! Berthold, glare not on meâ Why must my hand thus beckon him to danger?â Bert. The question mocks my patience!âWill he trust Aught but thy hand? Would it beseem the governor of Altdorf To break the chains of an arraigned murderer? Does it beseem the daughter of Fredolfo To pause, when her sole touch can burst those chains? Would Adelmar obey the Austrian's bidding? Will Adelmar reject Urilda's call? Uril. Give me the paper! (She snatches the paper, then shrieks at seeing the horrid change in his expression.) Canst thou betray meâcanst thou?â Say that thou wilt notâspeak, but look not on me! Bert. Have I not said? Uril. Swearâswear! Bert. And by what power? Uril. (with fervent agony) Swear by that Heaven who saw a father's crime;â That Heaven who sees a daughter's broken heart;â That Heaven who sees the tortured and the perjured;â That Heaven who on my crush'd and whirling brain Hath flash'd a horrid lightâswear, this instant swear! Bert. (with the utmost affected coldness) Why, here's a coil to win thee to thy will.â I care notâIâto bear such thankless officeâ The sorry meed of fond officious virtueâ In faith I am too pitiful, and patient! (Increasing his assumed indifference as he watches her increasing agony.) The hours are waning; life wanes fast with them:â The beam of morn may gild a bloody scaffold. (She staggers towards him.) Sign an' thou wiltâhold! that is not the paperâ Thou'st seized my garment's hem! Uril. (madly) Give me the paper! There! there! (She snatches the paper and signs her name.) Thou hast it nowâthou hast me, Berthold! (Attempting to snatch the paper.) But ifâoh, noâI will not think. Bert. (detaining the paper) Thou must âIn this dread moment of thy utmost fateâ Be more than Nature's woman,âthink and act. Uril. (Resolutely.) I will! Bert. And can'st thou? Uril. And I can! Bert. Away then! Sit by thy father with a patient smile,â Win o'er the weary hours with constant talk,â And when the prison-bell o'er vault and dome Booms its deep sound, startling the wretch that sleeps not, Rouse all thy courage at thy utmost need, For then will be a need to try that courage. [Urilda rushes to him in an agony of gratitude. Away, and save thy father! Uril. I must bless thee! [Rushes out. Bert. (Following her with a wild laugh.) How weak a thing is woman, when she loves!â How fierce a thing is woman, when she hates!â Enter Wallenberg and Officer. I haveâI have itâin my hand I grasp itâ The doom of Adelmar!âUrilda seal'd it. Wall. Away! begone, and find himâshould he 'scape!â Bert. Fear notâI've watch'd his stepsâhe is at hand, With all his desperate band still prompt and restlessâ They want but thisâ(the paper) and they, ere long, shall have it. Offi. Shall we not toll the bell, and give the alarm? Wall. Toll for thy knell, if that thou dare to touch it! [Throwing off his fierceness, and assuming a malignant caution. On, slave!âbut steal with an assassin's tread.â The mother, to whose breast he smiling clung In life's young morn, when life is loveliest, Felt not his weal more dear than Wallenberg! No hand must be upon himâhe is mine! Not worlds shall buy his heart-drops' priceless ransom. Before her eyesâand summon'd by her handâ Then,âthen,âto see him writheâand hear her shriekâ Oh! let me drain that last rich draught of vengeance, Thenâfling the cup away! [Rushes out, followed by Berthold and Officer. SCENE II. A vaulted Room in the Prison; large folding doors in the back. Urilda and Fredolfo discovered. Fred. And art thou here? Come to my breastâNay, do notâ These chains may bruise theeâI ne'er felt the burden Till their cold clasp made me forbid my child's.â Uril. (Embracing him.) They shall not keep thee from meâthey are lightâ [Looking up at him with fond hope and confidence. Father! thou canst not be a murderer! Fred. Goâclose the doorâI had forgotâforgive me,â A dungeon door is ever barr'dâMy child!â [She looks terrified. Nay, gaze not on meâit is horribleâ But it is justâmy crime was horribleâ I've bow'd to ask forgiveness of my Godâ [Kneels. I kneel to ask forgiveness of my child. Uril. âO, holdânor drive me mad!âO, wouldst thou see me âDash on this floor of stone my desperate brain?â Fred. I bend not now to Heaven, for Heaven hath spoke itâ But thou must speak it too. Uril. (With deep emotion.) Well then,â [Rushing to him, and clasping him in her arms. I cannot! Fred. Urilda, hang not weeping on my neckâ There was an hourâOh! that it was to come! For I was virtuous then!âbutâ Wallenberg!â Uril. (Starting.) Wallenberg! Fred. That bad man's father! He, in my absenceâTo a daughter's ear I cannot tell the tale of woe and shame!â The base and brutal spoilerâin my absenceâ [A long pause. The shriek I heard not rings for ever hereâ [Another pause, during which Urilda stands in conscious horror. The spirit burst from its dismantled dwelling, [Rapidly. And left thee motherlessâand me a wretch. Wild from my blasted home I rush'dâI met himâ [A long pause, he utters every following line with increasing difficulty, and she listens with increasing terror. 'Twas the dark twilight of a stormy eve,â [A longer pause, she watches him. 'Twas in a lonely mountain's dismal passâ My hand was on my swordâthe victim thereâ I struckâ Uril. (Clinging to him with a scream of horror.) Noânoâthou didst not!ânoâ Fred. (Gloomily.) I did! (Triumphantly.) This was the arm that struck!âthis arm again Would smite that worse than murderer to the earth! Uril. (With a fearful hope.) There was no witness? Fred. Berthold stood by me, And still he stands the stern and awful witness Of that dark hour! Uril. (Shuddering.) Berthold!â Fred. (With increasing difficulty.) There was another,â A peasant boyâwho did his innocent breast, With loud and helpless outcry, long oppose To blows not aim'd at himâTwas Adelmar! I hated himâfrom clime to clime I drove him;â But to his mountain-home he would return,â Return to save thy lifeâand I repaid himâ [Bitter self-reproach. Iâthrust him in a dungeonâbutâI freed him. Crime follow'd crime;âon murder treachery, On treachery vengeance, and on vengeance fear, Came link on link, to bind me to perditionâ Each faster lock'd even by the toil to break them: [With convulsive emotion. But I have burst through all! Uril. O, misery! Fred. 'Twas misery unknown, unspeakableâ For I was guilty! Uril. (Clinging to him.) Thou art innocent! In the day's glare, or in the dungeon's gloom,â In the sight of partial man and witnessing angels, In the sight of awful heaven, thou'rt innocent! And heav'n will judge thee as thy daughter judges. (A distant shout.) Fred. (Starting from her arms.) Hark! hark! that shoutâwhat means it? Uril. (With an exulting shriek.) That thou'rt innocent! 'Tis heaven's deep echo to a daughter's cryâ They come, they come to burst these horrid walls! Fred. (Trembling.) To burst these walls? Uril. I could not speak before The secret of a heart too sad for hopeâ Thou art their prizeâand Adelmar their leader! (Shouts without.) Fred. (With much agitation.) Would they had let me die! I was prepared For all but life!âWould they would let me die! Uril. You shall not dieâHark! hark! they come! they come! Hark! to the peal of the thundering multitude!â Hark! to the crash of bolt, and bar, and beam!â (The noise increases.) [Fredolfo sits down on a stone bench, and clasps his hands over his forehead, while Urilda, in an agony of joy, traverses the stage, echoing every sound and shouting as the assault on the prison-doors increases. âAnd they comeâ is in the shout, and the tread, and the trample.â They are here! (The doors give way.) Smite, harder smiteâthe saints to speedâ They yieldâthey fallâthey're here, and Adelmarâ Brave Adelmar their leader! Wallenberg without. Wall. Down with them! trample on them! Wallenberg rushes in with Ulric and a numerous band, who surround Fredolfo. Waste not a moment on those baffled slavesâ Seize himâsecure himâdrag him to my feet, My state's whole treasure to the hand that holds him! Where is he? Where is Adelmar? Ulric. He hath escaped! Wall. (after a long pause of breathless fury, going up to him.) Escaped! [Seizing Ulric. Thy life for hisâescapedâto rush upon us [letting go Ulric. Like a recoiling wave that splits the rockâ His wild and rallied force will burst on us Before the blow is struckâ (Pausing, and viewing Fredolfo.) Noâno, it shall notâ I have this victim yetâGuards! seize the murderer! [During Wallenberg's speech, Urilda shudders with wild stupefaction, not comprehending how Wallenberg can express such enmity against Adelmar.âShe starts on seeing Fredolfo seized by Wallenberg's band, and flings herself at Wallenberg's feet, still believing him her friend. Fred. I'm guiltyâlet me perishâsave that innocent, For, sheâwhat hath she done? [Falls into their arms. (Urilda kneeling to Wallenberg, who surveys her with dreadful composure.) Uril. Seeâseeâthey seize himâand is this thy doing? Wallenberg! Wallenberg!âmy friendâpreserverâ At thy command I summon'd Adelmar: (Grasping his robe, and shaking it in despair.) Wallenberg! friend!âyou pause in mockeryâ (with a faint laugh.) Mock me no furtherâfor my brain is whirling. [Shrieking in despair to him. They've seized my father! Are you not my friend! Are you not? Speak! speak!âspeak!âor, I shall madden! [Grappling him in an agony.âAfter enjoying it silently, he bursts into a demoniac laugh. Wall. Ha!âha!âha!âha! [She looks torpid. Fred. (Shaking his hand at him.) Oh! demon! demon! demon! Wall. (with ferocious triumph.) Ay, shake thy fetter'd hand in madness at me! Uril. (roused and interposing.) Wallenberg! loverâfriendâone word of mercyâ Thou can'st notâno, thou art not such a demon! Wall. (all his fury bursting out.) Yes, a triumphant demon!âat my foot The minor fiends in torment writhe and curseâ [She throws herself at his feet hopelessly. (Coldly.) Kneelâkneelâin beauty's eloquent agony, That I may sayâUrilda, neverânever! [Passing by her as she clings to him, and pointing at Fredolfo, then turning to her with redoubled malignity. Thy father perishesâ'tis justice dooms him! Thy loverâay, thy loverâhath escapedâ [Stamping with rage and agony. Or to a scaffold's black and bloody doom Thy voice had lured him,âand thy hand had led.â Mine was the thoughtâmine should have been the transport, To make thy fond credulity his fate!â [Turning to Fredolfo. But,âthou, at least, art mineâand thou shalt feel it! [Turns to Ulric, and speaking with cold solemnity. Go, seek the headsmanâtell him, the state's service From my reluctant tongue compels the wordâ Death for Fredolfo! Uril. (with a dreadful scream.) Noânot deathânot deathâ(To Ulric.) He said not deathâor meant itânotânot death! [Exit Ulric. (Fredolfo attempts to interpose.) Thou shalt not speakâthere's mercy in his face. [to Fredolfo. (Exultingly.) I seeâI see itâthough he knows it not. Wall. (raising his head-dress, and fixing on her the look of triumphant malignity.) Dost thou? [Urilda, falling prostrate on encountering his look, and giving up hope.âWallenberg, going, then returns to her, as she lies on the ground, and repeating the line in the third Act, with bitter irony. When the bell tolls, remember Wallenberg! [Going out, he speaks in eager and rapid tones to the guards. Make haste! make haste! do your dark work with speedâ Swift their returnâand fell will be their push! But their wild battle shall beâround his corse! [Exit with Soldiers. Uril. (starting up.) Where are you, father? [Feeling about in the blindness of despair. Fred. How is the hour? Uril. Heed not the moments! Fred. (with ghastly significance of look.) They are moments then! My lips are parch'dânot even to heaven In this dark moment can I breathe a prayer. [wiping his lips. The fierce and feverish thirst of agonyâ The quenchless fireâis lit within already. Uril. (with a shriek of horror.) Moments! Oh! that my prayers could lengthen Moments even horrible as these for ever! Fred. (nodding over his chains.) For ever! it will be for ever soon. Death, I have met thee in the battle fieldâ But never felt thee terrible till now! Uril. It wants a moment yet! [Embracing him wildly. The bell tolls. (She stands stupified.) Fred. (Calmly.) The moment's past! (Muffled drum beats without.) Berthold, guards, and headsman, with axe in his hand, appear in the opening in the back.â Guards bear torches. Bert. (Coming forward.) Prisoner, your hour is come! Uril. (with a faint scream.) Help! Adelmar! Fred. (sternly to her) Of help, or hope, or mercy, speak no more! They've urged me to the brink, and I stand there Like one, who on despair calls for dark strength, And feels his call is answer'dâLead on! I've trod with prouder step, but ne'er with firmer! [Urilda, half unconscious, clings to him. The guards, by order of Berthold, attempt to separate them. Uril. O! let me be a daughter, whilst I may, For long I must not be! [She attempts to employ herself about her father. Berthold interposes with malignant irony. Bert. Will not thy footsteps falter, gentle maid, When they must guide a murderer to the block? Uril. (Quite unconscious of the speaker.) They will notâand I thank you, gentle friend; [Looking up, and recognizing him, with a scream. Ah! Berthold! Mercy! mercy! dearest Berthold! Bert. Yeaâmercy brief and welcomeâsuch swift mercy As yon keen axe can deal. Uril. (wildly.) Yet, mercy! mercy! Mercy may dart between the hovering axe And the cold neck it quivers o'er. Fred. Lead on! (Shouts at a great distance.) Uril. (Catching the sound.) Hold!âby the fearfullest oath the lip e'er utter'd, By desperation's agonizing hope, Hold,âthere is mercyâhope,âbut not with youâ There is a voice in the airâheard you it not? (Rapturously.) Oh, first, my ear first caught it! Bert. (To the guards.) To the block! Uril. (as the tumult without increases.) Noâdrag me firstâmy father! [Grasping him convulsively. Clasp! clasp me close! Bert. (Fiercely to the guards.) Drag, drag them both! [The guards approach, and seize them. They struggle with them. She clasps Fredolfo closer. (Shout without.) Fredolfo! Uril. (Clinging to her father, and echoing the shout.) Fredolfo! list!âFredolfo, hear, and strive! I will not from this trunk unclasp my hold! It is not yet a corseâit shall not be! [Struggling with them. Rend, rend awayâhe is yet alive! (Trumpets.âShouting.) Adelmar and his band rush in on all sides, and overpower Berthold and guards. Adel. (Rescuing Fredolfo, and committing him to his band.) Bear him off, quick! this breast shall guard your passage. [Fredolfo is borne off, struggling, by Adelmar's band. (understanding his gestures.) Leave her with meâresist notâbear him hence! (approaching Urilda, who is fainting.) And thouâOh! let me save theeâdroop not now, One moment's well-waked energyâ [Urilda pursuing her father with her eyes, and then falling senseless in his arms. Uril. He's safe! He's safe! [Adelmar raises her, and is carrying her off, when Wallenberg rushes in, and assails him. Wall. Turn, traitor! Villain, turn! [Attacks him; Adelmar parries the blows, till finding Urilda in danger of being wounded, he is compelled to let her fall; Berthold, watching his opportunity, catches her. Wallenberg's knights seize Adelmar and disarm him. (to his knights.) Drag him hence! [Knights force Adelmar off the stage. For, oh! I gaze upon a dearer prize! Urilda! Bert. Urildaâall thine own! Uril. (recovering slowly.) Where, oh, where am I?âThere was death and blood, And a broad sea of gore,âand in it floated A father's headless corse, tossing and wreck-like, And still I plunged, and plunged, and still in bloodâ At last I fellâ [Unconsciously starting at finding herself in the arms of a man. Ah! monster,âis it thee! [shrieking. [Urilda struggling to free herself, and supplicating even Wallenberg in her favour. Oh! save me! save me! Wallenberg, protect me! Wall. (scoffing.) What! are those pleading arms held out to me? Uril. They are! they are! to theeâOh, mercy! mercy! [Wallenberg derides her distress. Oh! mock me not in this fell fearful moment, Good,âmerciful,âdear Wallenberg,âOh! save me! Oh! mercy! Oh! mercy! Wall. Berthold, guard thy prize! [Urilda, with a dreadful shriek, bursts from Berthold, and darting into the arms of Wallenberg, clings to himâHe bears her off, with a fierce laugh. Ay, let Fredolfo fleeâsince thou art here!

Ayâand mountain shouts Shall through their echoing arches strongly peal; They will revive him. Wal. If upon his ear His daughter's distant voice should softly fall, That would revive him. Fred. (Starting up at the word.) Daughter! said he, Daughter?â Who hath a daughter? noneâfor mine is lost. And ye, who round me stand, cannot be fathers; Your touch is bloodless, and your eyes are stone, Or ye would rend them out, ere they were blasted With all that I must live, and look upon. [A long pause of agony, then solemnly addressing them. Men, if ye are fathers, Steal on your slumbering infant's holy sleep, Gripe the weak throat, and hush the feeble cry, And turn the cradle smile to death's dull gape;â Their throes may palsy your unnatural touch,â Their cry may deafen the cold ear it smites,â But ye shall never hear the cry I hear!â The cry of her, who on her father calls To save herânot from death! [Falls back exhausted. Wal. Press not around him, gentle friends, I pray.â He scarcely livesâour wild and sudden flight, Our stormy struggle with the troubled night In the dark mountain-passâ Fred. (bursting from them) Hence from me, all! Betrayers, and not friendsâWhat have ye done? Ye've torn me from herâtorn me from my daughterâ She shrieksâshe calls on meâI hear her voiceâ So shriek'd her motherâand I hear her stillâ (To a soldier) Come hither, thouâWhy dost thou shrink from me? I know thee wellâ'twas on Morgarten's rock I stood beside thy father; with this arm Swordless I met the blows that would have fell'd him, My sword being broken on the Austrians' crests. (To another) I saved thy brother! (To another) From the crashing rocks I dragg'd thy kinsman, while my strained arm Upbore the pile he writhed beneathâI saved himâ There is not one of you that hang on me But owes the life of father, friend, or brotherâ And yeâand ye have torn me from my child! Enter Peasants, leading Berthold forward. Waldo (advancing). Who breaks on us, Leading a stranger's rude forbidden step? Fred. (recognizing him, and rushing forward) Hold! I know him! The very air around him breathes of her! The sight of aught that saw her tells of hopeâ Speak! Bert. (falling on his knees) Save her! Fred. (trembling) May she yet be saved? Bert. She may! (Fredolfo rushes into his arms, then recoils at his marks of assumed penitent feeling.) Fred. I do not like thy tearsâthere's art in themâ Thou wouldst with dry and burning tongue have told Thy breathless tale, had there been faith in thee. Bert. (vehemently) By every saint aboveâby listening heavenâ Fred. (retreating further) There is no truth in theeâthe man that feels [with much emphasis. Her holy power within him scorns an oath. Waldo. What pledge hast thou? Bert. I am myself my pledge. Through the foul hurtling of the pitiless night, Through the dark terrors of your mountain pass, Where life was risk'd at every step, I trodâ But trod in vain, since on a father's ear The tidings of a daughter's safety fall Faint as a passing breeze! Fred. (doubtingly) Stand far from me! Let me gaze on thee at a safer distanceâ How fares my daughter? Bert. Well, if so it please Her father she shall fare. Fred. There is a smile, A fiendish herald, that foreruns thy speech! Smile not on me, but speak! Bert. I will, and briefly. Two hours are scarcely wanting to the dawnâ Within less space are many evils done. Fred. (in impatient agony) Go on! Bert. Within those hours, whose minutes fly, Fierce Wallenberg hath sworn his father's murderer Must to his mercy owe his forfeit life,â Or else that forfeit, long to justice owed, Shall at fell price be ransom'dâneed I name it? Urilda trembling waits her father's answer. Fred. (after a long pause) Lead me to death! Waldo, &amp;c. (gathering round him) Thou shalt not goâthou must notâ He doth abuse thee with a wicked tale. Fred. (turning on them, calmly) Know I not Wallenberg? Lead me to death! Bert. Thou hear'st their cryâbut canst not hear thy daughter'sâ Still soothing to the patriot's ear the voice That tells of glories gone, but, oh! how thrilling The voice that tells of honour ne'er redeem'd. Fred. (breaking from them, and following Berthold) Lead on! I'll smite to earth the arm that stays me! Enter Adelmar, on the opposite side, dishevelled and bloodyâhis sword drawn. Adel. Hold!âhold! Waldo and Peasants (with a shout.) 'Tis Adelmar!â Adel. 'Tis Adelmar! Where bends your frantic speed? Fred. (struggling past him) To save Urilda! Adel. (with a shout, which is echoed by them all) She's saved! she's saved! Fredolfo hangs on him, as he leans panting and exhausted on his sword; the rest form a group; while Berthold retreats, with a scowl of malignant disappointment.) Bert. Curses! oh, curses on his arm of strength! Curses! oh, curses on his voice of joy! Adel. (to Fredolfo) Hang not thus helpless on meâblood, not tears,â(to the rest) Toss not your brands in mad and reckless triumphâ A moment savedâanother lost may lose her! I left her in the arms of Wallenberg! Fred. (recoiling) Left her! Adel. Not long I left herâthis sole arm, This spent and bleeding strength, what could it do? I left her to returnâ Fred. (shuddering) Return too late! Adel. A fewâa rallied, desperate, glorious fewâ Round my rear'd arm, as round a banner, bore, I tore her from their graspâbut, oh! too faint And few the blows of my worn followers fell! A shrine was near,âwith these exhausted arms I placed her by the altar of her God, Twined her pale fingers round the pillar'd cross, And press'd my lip to the cold hand I held; While with bow'd knee and reeking brand I pray'dâ Bert. (rushing forward) The prayer no saint will hearâthou frantic boy! Ay, gripe my throat! ay, rend me as ye willâ I know the truthâmay 't burst the ears it thrills! I knew her arms were round the altar flung! I knew that nought from that strong clasp could rend her But yon hoar head beneath her mercy bow'd! [Pointing to Fredolfo. I braved the stormâI braved the mountain wildâ I would have ruin'dâI can yet enjoy The ruin your own hands prepare for you! On, to the shrine! Around its rocking walls The force of Wallenberg already thunders! There, 'mid the heapy piles of mangled slain, My smile in death shall mock you as in life! Waldo and Peasants. Rend him in fragments! Fred. (solemnly interposing) Oh! no blood be shed! This be my high peace-offering for my crime! This may move Heaven for mercy on my child! Adel. Seize him with bloodless handsâbut well secure him! Bert. (struggling as they bind him) The strong church-gates are barr'd, but a strong arm May burst those bars! Adel. Villain! be dumb for ever! Bert. (pursuing his triumph) The shrine is high, the altar holyâayâ But there are hands that from the trembling cross Have rent the victim by her locks of gold! Adel. Curse, wretch! but speak not thus! Bert. (bursting from them, and kneeling) Then, hear me prayâ Hear Berthold pray, who never pray'd before! (Fredolfo rushes forward, while the rest drag Berthold from his knees.) Fred. Take the blasphemer hence! (He kneels solemnlyâa pause of agonyâhe rises.) I cannot pray!âBut he will hear the voice That cannot speak! (in tears.) Adel. (with emotion) I pray notâfor my choaked voice would fail! My last, wrought strength be spent upon this cryâ Draw every brandâflash them in Heaven's bright eye, And drawn, may they know no other name to whet them But hers for whom this single arm hath struck, Nor, brandish'd, may they know another sheath But Wallenberg's foul heart! (Loud shouts from the peasants who followâ Adelmar turns tenderly to Fredolfo, and takes his hand.) Come on, my father! Fred. (starting from stupefaction) Am I a father? (Recovering himself, and snatching a sword from one of the peasants, and brandishing it wildly.) I'm a warrior yet! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Shrine, splendidly adorned and illuminated. Urilda alone, seated at the foot of the altar, which is raised, and clinging to it. Uril. I am in safety here! The lover may neglect the maid he woo'd, The father may desert the child he loved, But Heaven will not renounce the thing it form'dâ The worm that twines in humble agony Around its altar's pale! Enter Prior, magnificently habited, with Monks. Prior. What art thou, woman, Who hast with wild and desperate grasp laid hold On our high sanctuary?â Hast thou within thee fearful consciousness Of crime untold, unknown? (a pause.) Or, art thou conscious of some desperate deed, Which, done by other, must by thee be told? (A pause.) Why cling'st thou trembling to the altar's rail, Unanswering and speechless? Uril. I am innocent! Mercy, O, holy father, for a wretch, Who, by each holy thing around her, claims it! By saint and shrine I plead, Shelter from wild and horrid violence; Let my life-blood bedew the altar-stone, But tear not from its sacred hold my hands! Monk. She is Fredolfo's daughter. Round our walls Thunder the forces of fierce Wallenberg, And wilt thou risk our holy sanctuary To shield a fugitive wanderer? Uril. (quitting the shrine and falling at the prior's feet, whose robe she holds) Father, save me! Monk. If thou hast value for these holy things, Yield thee, and part in peace! Uril. (in despair, and retreating to the shrine) If I must yield, It is to heaven I yield, and not to man! For heaven will not forsake me! Prior (with dignity). Nor its minister! Behold, beneath this taper'd cross I place theeâ Let him whose brand of more than mortal might Dare boast, against this sacred panoply Lift his unhallow'd arm, and drop it powerless! (Noise without increasing.) Monk. Hark! hush thy wild boasting!âStern, mail'd men Are trooping round our wallsâfell Wallenbergâ(Noise increases.) âThey come! they come! âPrior (boldly). And let them come! âUril. (clinging to him) My father! âI tremble! âPrior. Tremble not. âUril. (wildly) âThe roof swims round!â (During this the noise increases every moment, and Monks crowd in terror to the sanctuary.) âThe doors are yielding! (Noise increases with great violence.) â(Trembling with apprehension) âWilt thou abandon me? âPrior. Abandon thee! âIf thou, indeed, in purity of soul, âCling'st to the shrine, where the soul's purity âAlone hath claim, cling boldly, and be safe!â The doors give way, and Wallenberg and his band rush in. They recoil at the entrance, till he urges them on. âUril. (screaming with horror, and clinging to the Prior) Oh! hold me! hold me! Heaven forsakes me now!â Prior (turning to them with much dignity) What are ye, that with desperate step dare tread Upon this hallow'd pavementâthat dare lift Your armed hands, where hands are raised in prayer? Wall. And what art thou, thou bold and impious priest, That dar'st degrade thy temple's sanctity, And spread the fold of thy polluted vestment Around the head of a doomed murderer's child? Prior (menacing). Advance another stepâ Wall. Advance, and seize her! Uril. (shrieking) Save me! oh, save me, father! Prior (trembling). Fear them not! Wall. (raging, as his band recoil) Dastards and dotards, must I bid ye twice? Uril. (struggling) Oh, holy father! to thy robe I clingâ To thy high altarâclasp meâcloser clasp me! Wall. (seizing her, while she still keeps a feeble hold of the Prior) She's mine! she's mine! Uril. (half torn from the Prior) Oh! hold me!âhold me yet! Fred. (Without.) Where is my daughter? Uril. (Struggling convulsively.) My father near!âO, for a moment yet! [Wallenberg tears Urilda from the Prior, takes her up the steps to the altar, and holds her, pointing his dagger to her breast, as Fredolfo enters with his band. Prior. (To Wallenberg menacing.) Hark! he comes! The avenger comes! and terrible his march! [As Fredolfo and his band enter, the Prior and Monks rush out. Fred. (Wildly.) Where is my child? I see her not! [Discovering her held by the arm of Wallenberg, he retreats in horror. I see her! Wall. (In triumph.) She's here! she's here! Behold thy child!âAy, bend and supplicateâ Bow thy hoar head in agony to earth,â Crouch like a slave beneath the galling lash, Writhe like a worm, that I may trample on thee, As I do thus! [Stamping. Uril. My father!âO, my father! Heed not his horrid wordsâthere is a death That all can dieâthe death of broken heartsâ Bow not thine honour'd head to earth for me! Fred. Wallenbergâfoeâman whom I loathe and fearâ To earth I bend my trembling head before thee! [Kneels. Wall. Cast down thy weapon! Fred. (Throwing it from him.) At thy feet I cast it! Wall. Dismiss thy traitor band! Fred. (To his band.) Away! and leave me! Uril. (Struggling vainly while this is done.) Father! O, father! mercy for thy child! O, let some arrow's wing, or javelin's flight, Be strongly aim'd to quiver in my heart! Adelmar rushes in with a reinforcement. Adel. What! stand ye here to parley, coward talkers, While in that ruffian's grasp Urilda writhes? Who bears a brand, and boasts man's arm to wield it, Follow and save her! Fred. Hold! or she is lost! [Fredolfo, in agony for his daughter's safety, holds back Adelmar, who is now horror-struck by her danger. Wallenberg addressing Adelmar, as he gazes with malignant delight at her lover and her father, neither of whom dare to advance. Wall. (To Adelmar.) Her father bow'd to earth beneath my feet, And thou, her loverâfor her trembling life What wouldst thou give? Adel. (Kneeling in agony.) My life! my soul! my all! Wall. (Deriding him.) Romantic prodigalâI ask thy sword! Uril. (Wildly.) Yield it notâyield it notâAdelmarâmy loveâ Yield not our only hopeâthy faithful sword! Fred. (Supplicating Wallenberg.) Take, take my worthless lifeâbe mine the ransom! (To Urilda.) Have mercy on thy father!âlet him die! Adel. Spare reverend honour'd age,âspare helpless beauty! Do on these youthful limbs your butcher-workâ Their strength will long defy the torture's toil! Uril. (In distraction and struggling.) Kneel not to him for mercyâhe hath none. (Suddenly changing.) I will beneath thy feet fling my crush'd heartâ [Dreading the danger of Fredolfo and Adelmar. I will be thine, I'll love theeâworship thee! Adel. (Starting up.) His! his! that word hath wither'd up my heart! [Kneeling, and offering his sword. Here! take my sword! Wall. (Stabbing him with it as he kneels.) I doâandâthus I use it! [Adelmar falls; Wallenberg releases Urilda, pointing with a dreadful smile to his prostrate body. Fredolfo, overcome with horror, shrinks back, and hides his head in his mantle for a few moments. Urilda falls beside Adelmar, then turns to Wallenberg. Uril. Devil! O, devil! not one stab for meâ I do not prayâI ask no mercy now! [Adelmar, half raising himself, fixes his eyes on her. Ah! still he lives! and while there's life, I hope! [Turning distractedly to Wallenberg. Mercyâdear Wallenbergâkind Wallenberg! [Adelmar expires. (Starting up.) Life is no moreânor is there mercy now. I kneel no moreâI curse thee to thy face! [Dashing herself deliriously beside the body of Adelmar. Fredolfo recovering himself, and rushing on Wallenberg, who stands in malignant stupefaction at the spectacle of Urilda's despair. Fred. Villain! let Vengeance pay her triple debt! This for the sireâthe motherâand the child! [After a short conflict, he thrice wounds Wallenberg, who falls against the altar, pointing to Urilda. Fredolfo views him as he falls with a look of dreadful triumph. Wall. (Struggling to raise himself.) Thine eyes look curses at me, though thou speak'st notâ Those curses are my parting soul's rich benisonâ 'Tis all I ask! [Recovering some strength, rising, and grasping the arm of Urilda, whom he flings towards her father, a paralyzed and frozen object. Ha! this is better still! Thou seek'st thy daughterâtake her from my hand! [He flings her into the arms of her father, falls, and expires with a laugh. Fred. My child! my child! is it my child I clasp? What ghastly thing art thou, with lightless eye, That starest on me in stone! if thou hast life, I do adjure thee, speak!âSave me from madness! Urilda! daughter! speak! Uril. (Slowly recovering.) What voice is that? I deem'd that it was pastâbut still I'm hereâ Chain'd down in tortureâstruggling with a fiend!â [Pushing away her father. Avaunt! thy touch is fireâmy veins are scorched! I blaze!âI blaze!âstand off!âpour rivers o'er me! [Shrieking. Ah! with hot gore ye drench meâI'm o'erwhelm'd! A sea of blood!âdown, down, amid the billows! Down, down for ever!ârest is at the bottom! [Fredolfo sinks into the arms of Waldo, Urilda staggers feebly towards the body of Adelmar, and sinks down beside it. Father! you knew himâwould you know him now? [Staggers to her father. There is a band around my brain and heart! A burning cord!âCan you unloose it, father? It bursts, it bursts!â'tis a sweet agony! They thought to part usâthis hath baffled them! Mine, mineâfor ever mine!âSee how I smile! [Falls on the body of Adelmar, and expires slowly, forcing a smile as she sees her father's agony. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, By A. A. WATTS, Esq. SPOKEN BY MISS BRUNTON. [Speaks as entering.] Now for my part!ânay, frown not on me so: Good, gentle critic, smooth that ruffled brow; Prithee, the lightning of your wrath delay Until you've heard the little Pve to say! A few years sinceâthe fashion is gone by Like many others, though we know not whyâ The Tragic Muse, I'm told, was judged by rules From Nature drawn, not gathered from the schools; And if she touched the heart had nought to fear From the fool's scoff, or pedant's look severe. Our censors now a different mode pursue, Nor always yield the laurel wreath where due; Some,âwith bent brows and most portentous faces, Spy out defects the author meant as graces, âAnd quick condemn, without one qualm of conscience, âEach daring thought as most egregious nonsense;â Heedless the while, amid their work of slaughter, That the best pearls lie in the deepest water! âFain would they stay all genius in its flight, âBecause it soars above and mocks their sight; âThe loftiest energies of mind restrain â'Neath the dark link of caution's chilling chain,â âAnd, owl-like, seek to blot the orb of day, âBecause their eyes are dazzled by its ray.â Others there are, so partial to a joke, That sober reason seems to them a yoke; And so to ease it, and produce a hit, They make the bardâa whetstone to their wit! True or untrueâno matterâthey must say A few smart things about him and his play; For 'twould be hard if they for candour's sake Must balk impromptusâit took weeks to make! Thus hath our poet dangers twain to shun, His Scylla ignorance,âhis Charybdis fun;â Yet, well assured that there are many here From whose just judgment he has nought to fear,â In whom, with knowledge and a taste refined, Heaven's choicest gift! a noble heart, is join'd;â And all encouraged by the tears and sighs Vouchsafed from yon fair bosoms and bright eyes; So that he 'scape the swell of that dark oceanâ That sea of heads, e'en now in fearful motion,â To-morrow night he will respread his sail (Grant ye, kind destinies, a favoring gale) With talismanic art revive the slain, And dare the ROCK and WHIRLPOOL o'er again.</field>
