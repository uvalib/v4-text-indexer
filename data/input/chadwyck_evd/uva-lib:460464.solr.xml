      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âAn Apartment; Views of Ruins. VIVALDI and PAULLO enter. VIVALDI. Come hither, my good Paullo. I have found thee Still trusty ever. Thy most zealous service Hath been attemper'd by a love as steady As waits on equal fortunesâand thy master Looks on thee as a friend in whom his thoughts Find sanctuary, and his wishes aid. PAULLO. You over-rate my merits, gracious Sir; I have nothing but honesty, and some odd quirks of humour, which you accept in lieu of abler service. VIVALDI. Attend me, Paullo. Spare professions. Hear, And then assist me stedfastly. Some months Have now elapsed since, at San Carlo, I Beheld a lady, whose unmatch'd perfections Made conquest of my heart. It was at mass; And holy was her influence: she inspir'd A passion sacred as the solemn rites, and pure As the white vestments of their ministrant. PAULLO. Nothing more likely, when the flesh is raised as high as saintly-virtue, it must settle at last upon some daughter of frail Nature. VIVALDI. Spare comment, and observe me. Since that time I have, in private, often visited, And pour'd my soul before her; she receiv'd me With maiden-modesty, and artless truth, But high-uplifted sense of honour; firm Not to accept me, but with the consent Of both my parents. PAULLO. That is contrary to all received procedureâ modern usage makes pardon and consent keep company. VIVALDI. I'the road to Altieri stand the ruins Of Fort Paluzzi. You have seen, no doubt, An arch suspended on two rocks; near which, As often as I visited the lady, Some thing, of earth or air I doubt, rose darkly, In form a monk, wrapp'd closely in his cowl, And bade me dread the road to Altieri. PAULLO. Schedoni, on my life.âThat meddling priest has pierc'd your secret, and by these strange threats seeks to deter you from your purposes. VIVALDI. That I would know for certain. You, good Paullo, Shall soon as dark attend me to Altieriâ But see, Schedoni comes this way. Retire. Some previous sounding may not be amiss, And his close soul may flame out on suspicion. [Exit PAULLO. Enter SCHEDONI. SCHEDONI. Benedicite!âHealth and peace be with you. VIVALDI. The like to you, most sage and holy father. You find me musing on the wrecks of time! These faithful portraits of our country's ruins. I wonder that my mother has not here The ruins of Paluzzi; close at hand, They might be drawn with ease. SCHEDONI. 'Tis so, my son; We slight what lies before us; and our sires, Those human ruins mould'ring in our vaults, Are lessons bound, whose clasps we never open. VIVALDI. Father, perhaps you've lately seen Paluzzi. (With a glance of scrutiny.) SCHEDONI. A striking vestige of antiquity! VIVALDI. That arch between two rocks suspended, one Topp'd by the fortress-towers, the other crown'd By the tall pine and spreading oak, produces All that we claim for picture, saving only The human figure, to give life and action. Groups of banditti, ready to burst out On the unguarded traveller; or some Monk, In his dark vesture, stealing from the shade, Like some supernal messenger of evil, Would work it up in true sublimity. SCHEDONI. You paint most richly: and I much admire The skill, that coupled monks with your banditti. VIVALDI. I drew no parallel. Your pardon, father. SCHEDONI. There's no offence. (With a ghastly smile.) VIVALDI. My fancy turn'd on monks From real occurrences; for though banditti Ne'er issued from it, yet I never pass'd That same Paluzzi, but a monk appear'd, And fled or faded from my sight so suddenly, That I have thought the shape was spiritual. But be it what it may, I hope ere long Better acquaintance; and shall tell him strongly Such truths, that he shall dare presume no longer To affect, as though he did not understand them. SCHEDONI. You will do right, if he has injur'd you. VIVALDI. I have not said he hasâand if you know so, It is by other means than my expression. SCHEDONI. I judg'd it by your eye, and tone of voice. VIVALDI. No, if I am injur'd, it is by that sly And subtle fiend, the secret counsellor, Who steals into a family to wound Its peace and honour. 'Tis the base informer, The asperser of the innocentâwho stands Convicted in the person now before me. SCHEDONI. I will not here affect to miss your meaning. You think that I have injur'd youâbut yet I will not trust myself to think you mean Those most opprobrious stains to light on me. VIVALDI. I mean them on the wretch who injures me: You best know whether they apply to you. SCHEDONI. If you direct them only to your foe, Whate'er they were, I have nothing to complain of. VIVALDI. Of this be sureâhe will not long escape me. (Exit.) SCHEDONI. Rash and insulting boyâGo, weave the web, That shall ensnare thy dotage into ruin. Hast thou so slightly read time's registers, To dare the gloomy vengeance of the cloister? Though I seem wedded to austerity, The iron scourge my exercise, my day Frozen by abstinence and hourly prayer, Yet, underneath this icy outside, glows As fierce a flame of masterless ambition, As e'er informed the conquerors of earth, And wither'd nations in its splendid course. Thy heart shall feel me, stripling, ere the sun Break from his brilliant chamber in the east, And wake thee next to think of thy Rosalba. Now to the marchionessâIf I can work Her pride to give the girl to my disposal, Exile or death shall shut her from his arms. (Exit.) SCENEâFort Paluzzi, as described before. Enter VIVALDI, followed by PAULLO with a torch. VIVALDI. Behold Paullo, we are near the spot. PAULLO. Yes, Sir. I had a presentiment of itâa certain odd sympathy of the nerves, which the vulgar would call trembling. VIVALDI. How! superstitious Paullo! PAULLO. Not the least, Sir; but the place itself makes a man rummage among the relics of the nursery; and though I think I could face any thing in the face of day, yet night, and such desolation as Paluzzi, make a child of me. VIVALDI. It is about the time now, that I have been cross'd by this strange visitant. PAULLO. Did you ever follow it, Sir? VIVALDI. O yesâI rush'd down the cavern underneath that arch. But, as I advanced, the faint moonlight could not struggle through the gloom âthe figure vanish'd, and I was compelled to hurry out of the damps for fear of suffocation. PAULLO. Well, at all events the torch will allow us to see the course he takesâif, indeed, it is mere monkish flesh and blood. VIVALDI. You had better for the present hide the torch in that little cavern on your right hand, and let us watch the projection of the rock, from which he must come to take his stand. PAULLO. Hush, don't you see some moving shadow cross the avenue? VIVALDI. 'Tis the shadow of the fortress turret. PAULLO. I beg pardon, Sir; but are you sure you heard a voiceâfor my fancy would easily fashion a monk: in short, are you sure it was not all moon-shine? VIVALDI. Certain. I was walking on Tuesday night this wayâand as I now do, casting a curious eye towards the arch, I heard at a distance the solemn murmurs of the mountain; when turning to proceed on my walk, I saw it. Enter MONK. PAULLO. Look! see there! it comes. MONK. She is goneâfor ever from thee. VIVALDI. By heaven the very same. Fly Paullo, bring the torch. [Exit. Paullo. Stay I beseech thee, whether of good or evil. By what strange pow'r dost thou know all my steps? What interest binds thee thus to give these warnings? Speak plainly to me, now. MONK. Fate speaks by death! [Exit. VIVALDI. Stay riddler! child of darkness stop! (he rushes after him sword in hand.) Enter PAULLO, trembling, with the torch. PAULLO. Santa Maria! protect us. I would call, but I fear the sound of my own voice. Lord, how this flame quivers! No; I believe it is my hand that shakes. VIVALDI (at a distance.) Paullo. PAULLO. What's that? my name! VIVALDI. Paullo. PAULLO. Yes, it's my name sure enough. VIVALDI. Bring the torch this way. PAULLO. I beg to be excus'd. There are times and seasons for all things. What can animal courage do against the devilâI beg his pardon. (The monk comes behind him, and then, advancing, glares upon him in a menacing manner, and exit at the side scene.) (PAULLO falls upon his knees.) Saints and martyrs guard me! Enter VIVALDI. VIVALDI. It has again escap'd me. Paullo, where are you? Paullo, what upon the ground? arise. PAULLO. Holy power forgive me! I'm a poor servant drawn into profaneness by a master it is my duty to follow. Forbear to touch meâI feel it in my marrow, and my blood is frozen. (hiding his face still.) VIVALDI. Why, Paullo, are you mad? PAULLO. No doubt of it, Sir,âspiritâangel. VIVALDI. Come, Sir, rouze yourselfâ'tis I, Vivaldi speak to you. PAULLO. No: yesâcan it? O Lord! yes, it is my masterâcover me, defend a poor, fond, faithful sinnerâ(clings to him.) VIVALDI. Come, look up, there is no dangerâThe villain escap'd me. Why did'nt you bring the light? PAULLO. I was coming, Sir,âwhen all of a sudden I heard myself called, and turning my head cautiously over my right shoulder, which a man does when not very bold in a service of danger, there I sawâ VIVALDI. Saw what? the monk! PAULLO. It was like a monkâthat is, it had a cowl on âa little open. His face seemed the spectre of a long fastâHe glared upon me with eyes flaming in sockets a foot deep in his head, and the motion of his arm, the very wind of it laid me prostrate on the ground.â(A bell tolls suddenly at a distance âthe monk at the top of the stage speaks.) âVivaldi, hark! the knell of death sounds heavily! all is accomplished. [Exit. VIVALDI. Yes, death is in that gale! I feel it here. It tells me that the fairest flower of earth Is dropt into the dustâits perfume gone. Yet I will run and clasp her to my heart, Wooe her cold relics to benumb my life, And even in death be wedded to Rosalba. [Exit. PAULLO. Master, my dear master! Hear your servant. [Exit. A Cottage near ROSALBA'SâFIORESCA enters making Nets.â(Sings.) AIRâFIORESCA. I. Other maidens bait their hooks, With practis'd glances, tender looks; And study tricks from subtle books, To hold the lover fast. Their golden line of locks so fine, Before his simple eye they cast, With bending bait, and swimming gait, To make him sure at last. Nonny, nonny, nonnino, Nonny, nonny, nonnino, Nonny, nonny, nonnino, To make him sure at last. II. When the village youth would bear Me trinkets, from the distant fair; However they were rich or rare, My Paullo pleas'd me best: What tho' the work of costly art, They called for praise in every part, My Paullo with it gave his heart; And what was all the rest? Nonny, nonny, &amp;c. And what was all the rest? I don't very well like this employment, though it gives us all bread. There is something treacherous in the fisherman's art. Like the courtier he proportions his bait to the palate of his prey, and spreads his deception with most success when his victim is under a cloud.â(Sings again.)âAh, Paullo, Paullo, I have however often spread my nets for thy affection, but I threw out no delusive bait âI angled only with the simple partiality of a poor cottager, and if I succeed, I shall be found as artless and affectionate as I seemed to be.â(Sings again.) Enter GRADISCA. GRADISCA. For shame, Fioresca, what a brawling do you keep hereâO, these young fry! frisking in the very mouth of the net. Poor Gudgeon, have you forgot already how our beautiful neighbour Signora Rosalba was spirited away last night from her cottage; dragged violently off, nobody knows whither? FIORESCA. No, motherâHer cries are even still in my ears! Can you surmise why she was carried away? GRADISCA. Why, I'll tell you.âYou know the Count Vivaldi used to visit her secretly. FIORESCA. What, can he have carried her off? GRADISCA. As sure as you're alive, girl. She has no aunt now living to protect her. FIORESCA. Then shame upon himâbut if my Paullo had any hand in the villainy, he shall never come into my favour again, I promise him. GRADISCA. What noise is that? look to the door, girl. Enter hastily VIVALDI and PAULLO. VIVALDI. Gradisca! answer me, and quickly. Know you any thing of Signora Rosalba? GRADISCA. Who I, Signor? Holy Mary, no. Why does'nt your honour know? VIVALDI. No more than you do. PAULLO (to Fioresca.) My dear Fiorescaâwe know no more of the matter than St. Januarius. FIORESCA. Nay, sure the saint knows well enoughâI'll tell you how it wasâ(they retire.) GRADISCA. Why, your honour says fairly, and speaks as sincerely as heart could wish! Well, heav'n disclose all! There's an eye that sees to the bottom of the muddiest pool. And if its foul weather to-day, it may be fair enough to-morrow. But to my storyâSpalatro has been down in the bay fishing for these two days pastâHe sleeps then at the old fortâand being lonesome, and tired of hearing Vesuvio growl at usâFioresca and I went to bedâI had but just got to the end of my hours, when behold you I heard a knocking at Signora Rosalba's cottage. VIVALDI. What time was this? GRADISCA. Why, as I guess'd by the few gondoliers upon the bay, it must have been near twelve. So I goes up to Fioresca, and wakened her; and then, very softly opening the casement, we planted ourselves to watch what was doing. We did'nt stay to throw any thing over us, for the night was dark, and nobody would think of such lazzaroni as us. VIVALDI. Well, go on, and be brief. GRADISCA. The knocking continued some time. I heard her exclaim, what do you want? A voice evidently feigned replied, Come down, and you will see our business. She, alarmed I suppose at being thus talked toârefused; upon which, they very fairly entered by force.âIn a few minutes, we saw the men return with the sweet Lady in their arms. She was gagged. They placed her before one of them on a horse; and then the whole party galloped off towards the wood. VIVALDI. Infamous villains! But I am reliev'd from my worst fearâI had suspicion of her death. My good Gradisca, I am obliged to your vigilance. âEnquire among the neighbours whether any of them remarked such an escort at that time, and what road they took.â I have my suspicions as to the perpetrators, which I will immediately realize, and then pursue her to the extremities of the universe. Paullo, attend me. PAULLO. I come, Sir. Farewel, girl. Good night, honest Gradisca. [Exeunt. GRADISCA. Ah, a kind hearted gentlemanâbut cross'd in love!âI warrant the Count felt a nibble upon the line, and has whipped her into the basket to flounder and flounce in vain. Enter SPALATRO. SPALATRO. How now, Smelt (to Fioresca) what do you do stirring at this time of the night?âGradisca, help me off with my boots? I have had a sweeping hawl, girl. Never threw nets better in my life. FIORESCA. Why, father, your boots are quite dryâYou haven't waded deep. SPALATRO. No, girl, but far. The prey was shallow. I have touch'd the zechins. GRADISCA. O Spalatro, here have been such doingsâDo you know Madam Rosalba was carried off last night? SPALATRO (hastily.) Did you see it? GRADISCA. Why yes, I did. SPALATRO. Aye, that cursed curiosityâalways rushing into troubled waters. What business had you with it? GRADISCA. None, not IâNo, noâas they spawn let 'em take, say I. But here has been the young Count Vivaldi here. SPALATRO. I saw himâWhat led him hereâHe did'nt suspect that Iâ FIORESCA. O no, fatherâwhy should he suspect youâYou are no cavaliero. GRADISCA. I told him too that you were at the fort. SPALATRO. He seem'd satisfied of that? FIORESCA. O yes; should he not? it was the truth. SPALATRO. Ayeâit was the truth. What did he say at parting? GRADISCA. That he suspected some one, and would realize his suspicions. SPALATRO. Whom did he suspect? GRADISCA. He did not tell us thatâ SPALATRO. Did you mention what you observed last night to SchedoniâI mean to Vivaldi? GRADISCA. O yes, I told him the little I saw.â SPALATRO. 'Twas folly to do so; we shall be put to the question. Bestir yourself no more in this affair. Fine objects we are to provoke the Marquis, his father! GRADISCA. Did the young Count then carry her off? SPALATRO. I have not said he didâbut it is likely. Let us to bed: I am tired with riding all day. FIORESCA. Riding!âyou mean wading, father. SPALATRO. True, girl; wading and rowing I mean. Come, come, to bed; and not a word I charge you of Rosalba. [Exeunt Gra. and Fio.] So, all's safe I find. Suspicion does not blow her blight my way. While knavery pays so well for a little mischief, no wonder if honest labour sometimes locks up his oar. [Exit SPALATRO. SCENEâThe Monastery of San Stephano. Enter MARGARITONE and ELLENA. MAGARITONE. You will stay here, until admitted to an audience of the Superior. ELLENA. Pray, Sister, inform me, who was that beautiful nun I heard sing so divinely at matins? MARGARITONE. I don't know, not I. There are a number of us beautiful women, and good singers. ELLENA. I mean she who executed the solo passage to the Virgin. MARGARITONE. O that was the Sister Olivia; but we do not think so highly of her beauty as we do of her voice. She is perpetually singing, and touches the lute in the best taste imaginable. (Music plays.) You may hear her now, for she seems to be preluding upon her instrument. ELLENA. I am interested excessively by her appearance. MARGARITONE. Well, I shall leave you to your recreation. [Exit. ELLENA. Sweet sufferer, how my heart is prepared to sympathize with every pang that thine can feel! âShe comes this way. Enter OLIVIA. OLIVIA. My fair young Sister, peace be in your breast. And yet, if I can judge of that pure brow, A convent cannot give that peace to you. How came you to San Stephano? ELLENA. By force Brought and detain'd. No predisposed mind, By piety or passion led to seek A cloister's consolation, drew me hither. OLIVIA. Ah! my dear child, some disproportion'd loveâ ELLENA. You mark my only crime: I dar'd to love. OLIVIA. Think me not meanly curious of your story, But let me know your name. ELLENA. EllenâRosalba. OLIVIA. Ellen!âRosalba! I think once I knew Features like those: yes, very, very like.â But no, it cannot be; yet am I led To feel the tenderest interest in your fate, And almost break my vow to counsel you. The Abbess soon will summon you before her, Perhaps command you instant take the veil; Seem to consent, reject not peremptorily. ELLENA. What my heart tells me would be mockery, My tongue shall never sanction by a word. OLIVIA. Poor soul, thou dost not know the perils here That wait on disobedience. Think, sweet girl, What merciless authority can pour Upon thy head, to make resistance bitter! ELLENA. I know that I must struggle with oppression, And nerve my mind against the coming storm. OLIVIA. Yet have we punishments that but to hear of Would stimulate submission.âThink, dear maid, Of being entomb'd, to dwell with putrid death; To linger years in vaulted sepulchres, Amidst unwholesome dews, and morbid stench From time-dissolved flesh. ELLENA. Do not suppose My purpose shaken by the nauseous horror! Never with life will I renounce Vivaldi. OLIVIA. Yet O reflect what it must be to hear The hourly tread of happy feet above thee! The consonance of harmony divine In sainted sisterhood; whilst thou, poor worm, Shalt creep from shroud to shroud, thy only change, Rest thy cold head upon some mouldering bier, And sleep in all the chilling damps of death. Think but of this, thy firmest resolution Will shudder into fearful acquiescence. ELLENA. No: death, with all its lingering harbingers, Shall never win me from my bosom's truth. OLIVIA. I doubt thee, fairest. You shall have my prayers. The Abbess comesâand I dare stay no longer. [Exit. The ABBESS enters with solemnity, followed by her Chapter. She takes a Chair prepared for her. The Nuns range themselves on each Side. ABBESS. Approach me daughter.âYou, no doubt, are conscious You are brought hither that the charms of youth Improperly directed may not sully The honour of a most illustrious house. ELLENA. Your sanctity will pardon me. I know No passion better than the love of truth. It is a truth, the Count Vivaldi sought me In honourable seemingâit is true too That I refer'd him to his noble parents, And lent no approbation to the suit Which had not their allowance to sustain it. ABBESS. Youth is habitually fickle, fair one. âNo virgin ere would lapse from chastity âIf the repulse to the protesting lover âWere never thaw'd by importunity.â Thus much to justify my friend's precaution. ELLENA. But can you think distrust of their son's firmness Gives them a warrant to imprison me? Am I thus torn from life and all its blessings, Because a noble youth presumes to love me? O'er him they have a parent's high controul; But upon me no right, but such as power gives; A tyrant's power, that's wrested from the laws, And violates the confidence of life ABBESS. High notions these, from one so lowly born! ELLENA. No one is born too low for justice, Madam. The humble feel as do the proudly born. Shun pain, court pleasure, wooe esteem like them. And the most subtle, but quick spark of love Strikes as much fire of passion in the poor, As that which warms the bosom of the mightiest. ABBESS. What! would you burst subordination's bounds, And level all in foul equality? ELLENA. No; and I hold such minds the world's worst plagues; For they have more ambition far than they Whose power and wealth they covet. They are slaves, Who sire the peaceful dwellings of their lords, To ravish, plunder from the flaming ruin. ABBESS. The Marchioness is just, though much offended. She orders you, by me, to take the veil, Or marry such a husband as befits you. If this meek reference to their decision Be not a fable, you can soon determine. ELLENA. What! because I refer'd him to his parents, Is it presum'd I do not love Vivaldi? Or, if the noble youth were nothing to me, Does it thence follow I can yield my heart To one it never throb'd at? or, if not, Seal up its unwak'd feeling at the altar? ABBESS. You are too bold. ELLENA. Your pardon, I am injur'd. Malice has silver tones, and placid looks. The persecuted kindle with resentment, And call a wrong a wrongâwhere'er they meet it. ABBESS. âIs it a wrong to open wide the doors âOf bliss eternal, to precarious honour?â Is it a persecution to enfold The feeble in religion's chaste embrace? ELLENA. No, Madam, when the soul approves the dwelling. When, stung with all the miseries of flesh, It wooes the altar to bestow its peace; 'Tis then, what it was meant, the bless'd asylum Of broken spirits and distracted minds. But undesir'd, its sanctions are prophan'd, And the august and sky-enthroned name Dishonour'd by the impious mockery. ABBESS. Thus far with patience I have listen'd, daughter, To language most unusual to this placeâ But mark meâwhen again I call upon you, Prepare yourself to make the choice I offer. (Exit followed by the NunsâEllena goes off on the opposite side.) CHORUS OF NUNS. HOW calm her life, who, the vain world deriding, Here finds that peace it denied to her breast: Care at the voice of her duty subsiding, Visions of rapture subliming her rest. Fancy exerting her airy dominion, Rouzes the Nun at the breaking of day; Sleep flies dispers'd by the rustling pinion, The wing of the seraph who flutter'd away. The wing of the seraph who flutter'd away. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENEâA Convent. SCHEDONI before a Shrine. To him the MARCHIONESS. MARCHIONESS. Father, your pardon for this interruption. Thus at the hour of night, with heavy step, And with a heart as heavy as my tread, I crave your best advice, and your assistance. SCHEDONI. Daughter, most welcome. But it should appear There was no need to tempt the falling dews For such advice as mine: my Lord the Marquis Is the best guardian of his house's honour. MARCHIONESS. The Marquis is the slave of prejudice: Bred in confin'd and narrow principles, He cannot reach at lofty purposes By means uncommon; when he should rush to action, He but deliberates 'twixt just and unjust, And poises scruples in a trembling balance.â He must not be consulted. But remember, What passes here is sacred. SCHEDONI. As confession. MARCHIONESS. This son of mine still hangs upon my heart. Unhappy boy!âKnow you his late proceedings? SCHEDONI. When first he found we had remov'd his mistress, He sought me in my convent: I was busied In the most holy office of our faith, And rapt in penitential recollection. He impiously assail'd my meditation, Broke in upon contrition, and with menace Slander'd my unsoil'd name and character. Our brethren saw, and will resent the insult. MARCHIONESS. What tidings have we from the Lady Abbess? SCHEDONI. There are no bounds to sacrilege like his: Know, he has dar'd prophane the sanctuary, And snatch'd his minion even from the altar. MARCHIONESS. I see we cannot be secure an instant, Unless the girl be first dispos'd of. This It is that now distracts my thoughts. What mannerâ SCHEDONI. And are you still to think upon the manner? Souls such as yours should promptly execute With courage, scorning vulgar modes of action. Were this shrewd wanton by the law condemn'd, How eagerly would you applaud the sentence! You feel the justice, yet dare not inflict it. MARCHIONESS. The law will lend no shield to such proceedings. SCHEDONI. You have the church, to shield an act of justice: For daring virtue it has absolution. MARCHIONESS. Does virtue stand in need of absolution? SCHEDONI. When I said so, I spoke to common notions. Remember that the girl is not immortal! A few years cut off from her guilty life, The honour of your family is sav'd. MARCHIONESS. Speak low, some one may lurk behind these pillars.â Necessity admitted for this act, How may it be perform'd?âwe cannot trust The important vengeance to a mercenary. SCHEDONI (ruminating.) No: mercenaries cannot here be trusted. MARCHIONESS. Yet, who but such wouldâ SCHEDONI. You amaze me, daughter. Why should we hesitate to right ourselves? MARCHIONESS. Ah! holy Father, where exists another Like you, prepar'd at once for thought and action? But when can this be doneâthe place, the manner? SCHEDONI. Down in the bay stands a lone habitation, But seldom noted: there a fisherman, After his day of toil, finds sordid shelter. I know the wretch, and know he may be trusted. MARCHIONESS. But yet, being mean and needy, are we safe? SCHEDONI. Lady, suffice it that I know the man. MARCHIONESS. I could have wish'd the secret and the deed Had left me debtor only to yourself. SCHEDONI. Could you suppose that I would do a murder? MARCHIONESS. A murder! no.âAn act of justice, virtue! Great souls anticipate the common process, And boldly dare redress the wrong they suffer. SCHEDONI. I could convince you, we may trust this fellow. MARCHIONESS. Well, for the place: you mention'd a lone house. SCHEDONI. True: in a chamber of that house, there isâ (Low music heard.) MARCHIONESS. What noise was that?â'Tis melancholy music, Touch'd by a fearful hand. SCHEDONI. Within that chamber There is a secret door. MARCHIONESS. Fram'd for what purpose? SCHEDONI. Suffice it that 'tis apt for our design. A passage leads thence to the seaâat night Its waves will leave no print of what has pass'd. (Music low and solemn.) MARCHIONESS. Again.âIt is a requiemâone departed. SCHEDONI. Heaven's peace be with him. I am summon'd hence.â Rely on my affection and my zeal. [Exit. (Music again.) MARCHIONESS. 'Tis a first requiem, and the soul but just Escap'd its fleshly dwelling. That is cold, Cold now and still, which but an hour gone by Was fill'd with mind, and throbbing with sensation. And what am I?âthe enemy of life! Come here to plot, perhaps against a soul! Return, Schedoni! No! he hears me not. How feeble are our strongest resolutions! While passion rul'd in my distracted frame, It found not, or it conquer'd all my scruples; One feeble note, a sound, an airy breath, Strikes on the heart, and wakes my slumb'ring pity. Ungrateful son, what misery you cause me! My peace of mind is lost, I fear for ever. [Exit. SCENEâa Church. VIVALDI leading in ELLENA. VIVALDI. Revive my love, and let those drooping eyes Lift their pure beams to happiness and love! The storm is past away that menac'd you. ELLENA. Vivaldi, I once thought no earthly power Should lead me to accept your offer'd plight Unsanction'd by your parentsâTheir injustice And your entreaty must absolve my vow. VIVALDI. Why tarries thus the reverend Priestâ'tis soâ Duty is tardy to the eager wish Of bliss-expecting loveâBut see, he comes! Enter PRIEST. Forgive me, Father, that I thought you long. Ah! could your feet keep pace with youthful fancy You had anticipated sun-riseâhurried From sleepless midnight to the altar's foot, And counted every pulse of yonder clock, That circulates the creeping blood of time; Gaz'd on the dial, doubted every minute, That accident had fetter'd down his hand, And mock'd meridian day with morning hours. PRIEST. May it be ever thus! VIVALDI. Most reverend Sir, Proceed you to the ritesâO if you know What 'tis to lose and to regain a treasure Dearer than life itself, you will not wonder At this impatience to secure the blessing. PRIEST. Young son, I yield me to your virtuous wishes. That gentle 'haviour, daughter, does announce No felt aversion to the youth's request. What therefore 'tis my pleasing task to do Is to pronounce in the most holy name Of mother church the solemn benediction. Enter several OFFICERS. 1st OFFICER. StopâProceed no further with the rites. ELLENA. Vivaldi, we are betray'dâBehold those menâ VIVALDI. Father, proceedâhe dies, who interrupts you. Enter Men in the Garb of the Inquisition. 1st OFFICER. In the name of the most holy inquisition I charge you, Vincent di VivaldiâYou Ellena di Rosalba, to surrender. VIVALDI. Of what am I accus'd? OFFICER. Of merely stealing this Nun from the Monastery of San Stephano. You may swear safely to the fact, for she wears the veil of her profession at this moment. VIVALDI. The veil is none of hersâthis holy Father I have already satisfiedâa friend Supplied the kind concealment of her flight. OFFICER. Confession of the robbery! We believe we shall be able to prove her profess'dâYou must go both of you before the inquisition at Rome. VIVALDI. Or give me way, or, by my love I swear, My sword shall cut a passage through your hearts. PAULLO rushes in with his sword drawn. PAULLO. Nay, come, I'll tickle some of you. Come on, you tipstaves for the devil's courtâHere are two of us candidates for San BenitosâWin us and we wear them. (They fightâone of the Officers is wounded; at last they disarm VIVALDI and PAULLO.) OFFICER. Bring them away. Bear off the Lady first. VIVALDI. No, let me perish ratherâOn my knees I supplicate the mercy of her company. OFFICER. A pleasant jest indeed!âIn company! Let criminals accompany each other! Fine evidence would be the consequence. Besides, indulgence after such resistance, One of our brethren wounded by your sword. PAULLO. Nay, friend, let your old black patron the devil have his due: The sprinkling of blood there is a piece of my handy work I assure you; and I only wish the same lancet could breathe the veins of your whole fraternity. VIVALDI. Paullo, I charge you, cease this idle folly. The wound was given by me. OFFICER. We know it, Sir, but he shall answer for his profane scurrilities in another place. PAULLO. Let me. And if you will rack the truth out of me, let their reverences look to it. If I don't whip their consciences with good stinging-nettle sarcasms, when they have done with me, may I visit their master the devil next door to 'em. VIVALDI. O my best loveâI cannot succour thee. ELLENA. VivaldiâO Vivaldiâ [They are torn off by the Officers. Exit. Priest. SCENEâthe Cottage of SPALATRO. Enter FIORESCA. FIORESCA. I can't think what my father does down in the bay so long? As sure as I live, he was concern'd in carrying off Lady Ellena. He had not been fishing that's clear. He had got money, for I heard the chink of the zechins. O that I could but whisper what I think to Paullo! And yet it might bring my father into trouble. Enter GRADISCA. But, my mother comes. GRADISCA. Ah, daughter, daughter. Yonder is doleful doings. FIORESCA. Where, mother? GRADISCA. Why, at the church of our Lady. The Count Vivaldi stole it seems Madam Rosalba from the Convent of San Stephano; and to our Lady they came to be married; but at the very altar they were seizedâand fighting followed; and Paullo drew his sword; and to sum up all in a word, they were overpowered and carried off to the prison of the Inquisition. FIORESCA. Paullo, too! Wounded! GRADISCA. No, no. Not woundedâbut worse, worse. FIORESCA. How worse, dear mother? GRADISCA. Why, as I hear, seeing his master in this non-plus, he flew at the officers like a sword-fish, and stabbed one of them an ugly gash. But they turned upon 'em like sharks, and it is death to resist 'em. FIORESCA. O, Paullo, Paullo! (weeps.) GRADISCA. Ah, poor wench, well may'st thou weep and take on. He was as good a youth as ever serv'd up macaroni, and as reverent to age, as if he had liv'd in the good old times.âI'll go and bring Father Sebastian hither to comfort you. O, that's a good Priest, aye, and a wise one too. I should never be so comfortable as I am, if it were not for his pious exhortations. FIORESCA. I shall never know comfort more, mother, if any harm befal poor Paullo. GRADISCA. You cannot say that.âHear Father Sebastian, that's all, and then tell me so. [Exit. FIORESCA. I have determin'd. It's a long distance for a lone girl; but no distance shall keep me from him. Yes, I will go to the gates of his prison, whisper into his dungeon that I would die to save him; and then bid my poor heart break and be at peace. Ah! this reminds me of the unhappy fate of poor Mary of our village. AIR. [I.] DARK was the night, the children slept, Poor Mary climb'd the cottage stair, And at her chamber window wept, And plac'd a little taper there. Why does he tarry thus, she cried? Alas! what pains do I endure! Heav'n grant this taper be his guide, And lead him safe across the moor. II. At length his well known voice she hears; âHe comes, my terror to remove! âMy William comes to dry my tears.â And down she flies to meet her love. William all pale and bloody stood; Sigh'd out âalas! no more we meet! âI'm stabb'd by robbers in the wood.â Then fell a corse at Mary's feet. [Exit. SCENEâA strong dismantled lonely Fort upon the Sea-side. Enter STILETTO, CORVINO and others, with ELLENA. 1st OFFICER. We are at our journey's end. ELLENA (aside.) 'Tis as I fear'd. Do we sleep here to night? 2d OFFICER. You do, my fair one. 1st OFFICER. What ho! Spalatro! ELLENA. When do we set forward? 2d OFFICER. We go to-night. He's dead asleep. Spalatro! Enter SPALATRO, from the Fort-gate. SPALATRO. What, in the devil's name, keep you such a bawling for? You're soon enough for the chear you're like to find. 1st OFFICER. Here is your charge. You know the rest I think? SPALATRO. Aye, aye. Wont you come in, damsel? This is a rude lodging; but the guests seldom complain. They are scurvily treated 'tis true; but then they sleep very quietly. ELLENA. I have no doubt of that friend. Lost for ever. (aside.) [Exeunt into the Fort. SCENEâThe Inside of the Place, a Table, a Lamp on it; a few Stools, and a Fire at a Distance. Re-enter SPALATRO, ELLENA, and the TWO OFFICERS. SPALATRO. Well, here we areâYou must be weary, Sister. I'll dress some fish, and we'ave a stoop of wine, A potent cordial for low spirits, girl. You'll need refreshment for your coming journey. My maxim is a short and merry lifeâ No bad oneâHa! Corvino! Come, some wine. ELLENA. I beg you will excuse me. The fatigue Of journeying so quickly makes me think A bed the best refreshment I can find. Pray shew me to my chamber for the night. SPALATRO. Well; if nothing else suits your palate, e'en as you like. I'll shew it you. Come, this way. [He takes a lamp, and she follows him out. STILETTO. Come, come, off with your holy skin, Corvino. Aye, aye, now I know you for as true a knight of the stiletto, as ever practised justice in the court of honour. CORVINO. Nay, the profession is honourable, no doubt. It is a sort of trial after term; what common leets take no cognizance of, we decide, and the best of our practice is dispatch. STILETTO. You shan't find me a profession equal to it, either for courage or dexterity. The art to waylay, the address to shift to any shape, and hold any language. Compare it with the trades most in vogue. CORVINO. Aye, marry; draw me some comparisons, brother. Try it with the soldier's. STILETTO. O, a mere flea-bite in respect of the danger; requiring less subtlety in design, and less promptitude in the execution. Besides, you shall have him be as active in the wrong as in the right. Now we never use arms but to redress some injury. CORVINO. To the nextâwe carry it hollowâthere. STILETTO. As to your physician, he gives death with torture. Ours is scarcely felt, and always sudden. He with his lotions and his potions holds nature as it were in purgatory. We set up upon a single pill, the extract of lead, which never fails to cure all disorders. CORVINO. Go on, go on. The lawyer's will not 'pose you. STILETTO. O, no, that's too clear a case to dwell on. He strips you of your land, and leaves your heirs to beggaryâWe take away only the living incumbrance, and bestow the property entire. Enter SPALATRO. CORVINO. Spalatro returns. SPALATRO. I don't half like the business. CORVINO. How nowâWhat devil has played truant, and left a corner of thy heart scrupulousâHan't you noble payment for her lodging? SPALATRO. She looks so innocently; and moreover, brother stabbers, I have a child myself. As she flung herself on the damn'd mattrass, I look'd at her by the lamp, and thought I beheld my own girl, Fiorescaâ STILETTO. Come, come; we must have no qualms like these. Either dispatch the business like a man, or we will earn this other purse ourselves. SPALATRO. No, no; I wasn't so chicken-hearted as that neither; only I did not like to trust the steadiness of my hand. His Reverence mix'd a bowl of milk here, which I laid by her, and I'll trust the Friar's balsam against hope in this world. I'm pleas'd to be rid of the deed, I can tell you. But come, our fish is ready. 1st OFFICER. You look disorder'd, Spalatro. Come, a cup of wine to dissipate vapours. SPALATRO. I believe it was that curs'd bleak gallery that chill'd me. You remember, Corvino, your handy work in the chamberâ CORVINO. Pooh, pooh; some wine, boys, and let us sing the chorus that Trombone made upon our way of living. CHORUS. HARK, the night crow shrieks for food! Wolves are howling in the wood! To the cottage clowns retire, And quake around the scanty fire. Then we track the gloomy way, Lurking to ensnare our prey. 'Tis he, stand close. Strike by surprize. What light's that? 'Tis the fire-gnat flies. Now then take aim! he falls, he dies. [Exeunt. Enter SCHEDONI. There are, who, wandering at this lonely hour, With murder for the herald of their way, Would dream that every gust of fretful wind Rebuk'd their purpose, and the roaring sea In solemn sentences condemned the deed. Ev'n I, whose reason mocks such childish thoughts, Feel unaccustom'd dread palsy my progress. In this rude solitude I turn and start, As though my path were planted with observers. Spalatro! Enter SPALATRO. SPALATRO. Here. SCHEDONI. Well, hast thou done this business? SPALATRO. No, for she laps up poison like an adder. I laid the bowl beside her. SCHEDONI. Is it gone? SPALATRO. Yes, she but sleeps though; I am just come from her. Her rest is much disturbed. SCHEDONI. That must be remedied. Here, take this dagger, and the work is easy. SPALATRO. I have no great affection to the thing. SCHEDONI. But, the reward.â SPALATRO. Well, the rewardâI grant you. [Exit. SCHEDONI. This blow atchieves my object. All were doubtful, Did I not work the Marchioness to something That render'd it unsafe to dare refuse me. She is my debtor now in all she has: Her bond is of such force when writ in blood, As to restore what once was Marinella.â Those steps of terror tell me it is done. SPALATRO (within.) Father Schedoni! SCHEDONI. Here, Spalatro.âWellâ Enter SPALATRO, with the Lamp and Dagger. Am I obey'dâhave you perform'd this deed? What mean those ghastly looks?âthat bloodless weapon? SPALATRO. The galleryâthe galleryâI dare not. SCHEDONI. Dastard! What bug-bear have you conjur'd up, To scare your senseless spirit from its office? SPALATRO. Go there yourself: I saw it, and I heard it. Murder the innocent! No: I'll sleep o'nights. Do it yourself: here, take the dagger from meâ Take itâMy hand is white again! SCHEDONI. Base coward! Stay then 'till I return. SPALATRO. No, you'll excuse me. Your Holiness may shield me from the devilâ I'll wait without. SCHEDONI. Where is the cloak, to wrap around the body? SPALATRO. It hangs just by the doorâyou see it, there. SCHEDONI. Give me the lamp. SPALATRO. You have it in your hand. SCHEDONI. I mean the dagger. SPALATRO. It is in your girdle. SCHEDONI. Now then attend me. SPALATRO. That is not the way. SCHEDONI. O, trueâshe sleeps you say. [Exit. SPALATRO. She does. [Follows. SCENEâDraws, and discovers ELLENA sleeping upon a wretched Pallet-bed; a Table, and empty Bowl on it. SCHEDONI enters with the Lamp. SCHEDONI. Yes, she's asleep! Fie on these shaking joints! Does not my interest tell me she must die? Hush! sure she speaks!âShe never will speak more. Oh! such weak thinkings will unman me quite. How deep that sigh!âHer whole frame seems convuls'd.â Can I remove her robe and not awake herâ (He looks at her Breast, and seeing a Picture starts; then eagerly detatches it, drops the Dagger, and shuddering draws back in an Agony of Horror.) Am I alive? and do my eyes see truly? Or are these features but a fancied charm, To bind that devil, which tempts me to destruction? Ellen!âawake! awake! (ELLENA starts up, shrieks, and falls at his Feet.) ELLENA. O save me! save me! Spalatro will destroy me! SCHEDONI. Quickly, tell me, How came you by this picture? ELLENA. 'Twas my mother's. SCHEDONI. Whose the resemblanceâtell me, on your life? ELLENA. It is my father's portrait, andâ SCHEDONI. His name? ELLENA. The Count de Marinella. SCHEDONI. My child, my childâIn me behold that father. Yet spare meâI shall blast you with my touch. Stand off! The springs of love are poison'd here: O misery! To have a star unknown, Beaming with brightness rise upon my view, While all the hemisphere is stain'd with blood. Let me gaze on thee! O that sweet alarm! Be hush'd my childâno danger shall approach thee. I'll make this breast a bulwark to defend thee. I rave! O pardon me! and bless your father. ELLENA. I stand amaz'dâEternal Providence! A father, my deliverer! O, Sir, tell me, Why the first care I meet with from my parent Preserves the life he gave? My infant years Ne'er knew a daughter's duty; but my heart Is apt I feel to learn its filial lesson. SCHEDONI. You shall know all, my child. But ah! the drink! ELLENA. Distrusting it, I threw it down, between The bars of yonder window. (seeing it on the ground.) Ha! a Dagger! The villain would have stabb'd me as I slept, Had not the father sav'd me from the blow. SCHEDONI (walks from her in the greatest Agony.) My Ellen, if you would not blast my senses, Mention this scene no more. Blot it from memory. Here, from this hour of terror and of transport, Promise, if possible, never to think of it. ELLENA. O, should I not? when it reminds my heart, How infinite the debt I owe my father! Where is Spalatro? Send that villain hence. Supported even by you, I dare not see him. SCHEDONI. He shall not meet your eye. Retire my child. The morning dawns. Get on your cloak, your veil, We will set out this moment. When I call, Come forth my sweet one. [Exit. ELLENA. SCHEDONI. Ho! Spalatro! Enter SPALATRO, with a cloak. SPALATRO. Here. Here is the cloak to hide the body in. SCHEDONI. Villain, be dumbâanother such a wordâ SPALATRO. What! will not her life then suffice you, Priest? SCHEDONI. She lives! dear as my life itself. SPALATRO. She lives! Where? for I see no signs of her existence. SCHEDONI. Be silent; let no syllable escape you Of that accurs'd design. I will reward you. Hope shall be outrun by my bounty to thee, So thou art trusty. We must leave you straight. Be not you seen by her. Hence good Spalatro. [Exit. SPALATRO. How badly read is destiny's dark page By man, who thinks himself a god in foresight. To tear Vivaldi from his lovely bride, Ambition would have made me kill my child! Yet what more sanguine wish could my soul form, Than to behold the heir of great Vivaldi Espouse the daughter of the Monk Schedoni? Vivaldi now; but that shall shape our course. My Ellena, approach. Enter ELLENA. ELLENA. Here, my best father. SCHEDONI. Come, my sole prideâwe will away for Rome; And think me not averse to thy attachment. Vivaldi shall be thine. I dote in fondness. My heart, unus'd to be awaken'd thus, Does like the bursting rock, gush out in streams; The flood is pure, and will refine its channel. Come, come, my childâ [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENEâA Hall. Enter two FAMILIARS of the Inquisition, with PAULLO struggling. PAULLO. What, separate me from my master! No, burn me if you do. Do, good catholic bonfire-makers, consider me with a little christian charity. What did I pray to come hither for but to be with him? Do you think I had any desire to see the inside of this infernal palaceâthat I came to the devil out of curiosity? 1st FAMILIAR. Fellow, no more of this. One may see you are a heretic by your manners. PAULLO. What, is it heresy when honest love takes the muzzle off a man's tongue for a minute or two? Call me what you please: Here I am, Paullo Mendrico, determined to perish with my poor master. If this is heresy, I glory in it. You shall find me toughly persist in it at the stake; and, if my coward tongue fail for a moment to proclaim it, may I fare worse in the next world than even an inquisitor. 2d FAMILIAR. Comrade, persuade this fool to submit quietly: If he talks in this way much longer, he will excite notice, and draw punishment upon his obstinacy. 1st FAMILIAR. Pray tell me; did not you say your name was Paullo Mendrico? PAULLO. Yes, and I am not ashamed of it any where. 1st FAMILIAR. You are a Neapolitan. PAULLO. I am, I hope I need not be ashamed of that either. 1st FAMILIAR. Look at me well, Paullo; don't you know me? PAULLO. Take off your death's head, and I'll try; no, yes, why it can't be Carlo! what Carlo. 1st FAMILIAR. The same, a little altered may be. PAULLO. O not at all: you were always a devilish odd fellow. But what has brought you into purgatory before your time, Carlo? 1st FAMILIAR. No matter, Paullo. Here I am, I can't say very glad to see you in this place; for between ourselves I am tired of it myself, but very much disposed to serve you. PAULLO. Serve me! then you must serve my master; Mind, Carlo! here I swear beforehand to accept no favour he does not partake. I am come here for the love of my master, and will not be wheedled by a selfish care of my own carcase to desert him. 1st FAMILIAR. We will speak more at length to-morrow: what I can do I will. I will shew you to your cell, and order all things for your comfort. PAULLO. Don't talk of comfort to me; comfort my master. [Exeunt. SCENEâA Cell, with a Couch. VIVALDI starts as from sleep. VIVALDI. How strong, how vivid are the fancy's pictures! Reality could not impress more terror Than I now feel from formless phantasy. Methought I saw the monk of dark Paluzzi, His cowl uplifted, frown upon my misery; His right arm bare, and in his grasp a dagger. He pointed to the blade embath'd in blood, And, in a voice that thrill'd my very heart, Call'd me by name, and bade me to attend him. (The Monk ascends behind the Couch in the Attitude described.) MONK. Vivaldi, mark me. VIVALDI. Horror! do I dream? Or waking do my senses still retain The images of sleep? Speak yet again, Thou spirit of terror! Tell me by what power That airy shape, which threaten'd in the gloom Of night and rude Paluzzi, follows me To these close dens of savage superstition, And cleaves the earth to aggravate its horrors? MONK. Listen 'till I unfold me. Well thou say'st I sought thee at Paluzzi; there I warn'd thee To shun the mischief that has brought thee hither. My present task is link'd to that vast chain, Which winds about the life of an assassin, And drags him through the lapse of time and action, To expiate his crimes. VIVALDI. My ears are rivetted To thy mysterious language; but instruct me How I am implicated in its meaning? No stain of murder burns in crimson here. MONK. Thou'rt in the toils of fate; I come to save thee. When next interrogated, summon before thy judges The Count de Bruno, known now by the name And style, Father Schedoni: accuse thou him Of having sacrific'd a guiltless wife, VIVALDI. If on such admonition, I consent, Which rashness only could resolve upon, What proof have I to offer of these facts? MONK. Cite as thy witness a right pious man Father Ansaldo: Bid him recollect What in confession was reveal'd to him Some fourteen years since, on San Marco's eve. VIVALDI. How if his memory have lost the secret Entrusted then? MONK. He never can forget it. It lives as freshly there, as if this moment The lep'rous soul heav'd up the guilt before him. VIVALDI. But how adjur'd will the confessor break The silence of confession? Tis a seal Upon the errors of all-sinning mortals, The claims of penitence on heavenly mercy, Written in bosoms secret as the grave, And only legible to God himself. MONK. The Inquisition can absolve this silence. Stand thou resolv'd to execute my bidding. If thou shalt disobey, expect a fate, Such as he merits, who would stay the stroke Offended Justice levels at the guilty. VIVALDI. But say wilt thou be present at the trial? MONK. I will, perhaps invisibly to thee. Yet we shall meet, and in the hall of death. [The Monk descends. VIVALDI. (Aside.) When will these mysteries clear up to my reason? If I should tell how I have been commanded, Would not they deem me frenzied, or suborn'd By some malicious foe to slander innocence? I cannot without further proofâ (turning round.) ha! vanish'd! I have heard of spirits unbless'd, who sought this world, To madden solitude and urge destruction, But heeded not the tales, as bed-rid fancies, The foul creation of perturbed brains. I shall believe all quicklyâpin my faith To gossip legends, and, with pious awe, Hold midnight peopled with released souls. The thing look'd corporal; its motion earthly; And all its visage lighten'd with the glare Of human vengeance. I must search this deeper. What ho! the guard without there! Speak to me. Bolts undrawn. Enter two of the Guard. 1st GUARD. What would you? 2d GUARD. Speak. VIVALDI. Have any enter'd here? 1st GUARD. When? VIVALDI. Why now, within the last half hour. 2d GUARD. He dreams. A likely thing indeed. Pray tell me Are doors like these easily penetrable? VIVALDI. Nay, but be very certain I conjure you; If you have slept, say so, I'll not accuse you. 1st GUARD. We sleepâNo, Sir, we value life too highly. VIVALDI. My friends, in solemn earnestness I ask, Is there no other entrance to this cell? 2d GUARD. None; you need only ask your eyes that question. A Bell strikes. That bell informs us we must lead you hence For secret scrutiny. VIVALDI. 'Tis very strange. Come lead me thither, friends. I am lost in it. [Exeunt. SCENEâThe Country about Rome. SCHDONI leading in ELLENA. SCHEDONI. Believe me, child, whatever I have seem'd, And I take shame to me for past neglect, You shall find in your late recovered father As fond a zeal to cherish and indulge As ever nature kindled in the parent. ELLENA. I have no wish but one ungratified. I had been taught to think that both my parents Died ere I felt their loss. I find a father, And his first kindness snatches me from death. The working stream of accident indulges A further hope. O, does my mother live? SCHEDONI. My child the hope is vain. Yet know, thou dear one, I would rejoice, so she were but alive, To make my bed upon the flinty rock, Its scanty moss my pillow, and its roots The meagre diet of my failing age; To quit ev'n thee for solitude and penance, So I could tell my soul Matilda liv'd. ELLENA. Ah, Sir, how died my mother! SCHEDONI. Spare me, Ellen. I would preserve thy love, my gentle child. Let sorrow for the errors of thy father. Subdue thy curiosity. ELLENA. I yield me. And in the gratitude for what is giv'n, Sink the regret for that which I have lost. SCHEDONI. But to my purpose. The young Count Vivaldi Is on slight accusation now confined, The reason of our journey hither child Is his deliverance, which my influence Will render easy. ELLENA. Does my father view With pleasure that attachment in his child? SCHEDONI. It is most welcome to me. And his family Will be propitious now to the alliance. Enter 2d Familiar, an Officer of the Inquisition. OFFICER. Stop! You, Marinella Count de Bruno, of late known by the name of Father Schedoni, I am ordered to bring before the Inquisition. SCHEDONI. Officer I obey and willingly, It was to appear before them I came hither. Let this young lady be bestow'd with kindness Till the affair that summons me be finish'd. OFFICER. She may command the best accommodation we can bestow, or take up her residence within the city. ELLENA. No, I will never quit thee, my dear father. To Schedoni. Sir, lead me where this reverend priest is going. Place with you is nothing. (To Schedoni.) [Exeunt. SCENEâA Cell in the Prison. PAULLO alone. Heigho! I am quite deceived, and as melancholy as St. Bruno. O for a little lively active torture to rouze my mind out of the vapours. I begin to find that the question is a very friendly call upon a man's bones; and prevents his soul from dropping dead asleep in the black ugly silence of a prison. What did I come here for, do they think? Why, to share my master's fate to be sure; and here I know no more what he suffers than if the same roof did not shelter us. Their Reverences overlook me. Perhaps they don't think a poor servant worth their notice. What's this; precedence in purgatory? Zounds I could give up my share in my master's good fortune; but his calamities are a common stock; and I have as much right to suffer as he has. Enter CARLO. CARLO. Well, Paullo. How are you man? You are likely to get over this business easily I find. PAULLO. What do you call easy? I would sooner leap into the bowels of Vesuvius, than pass another day here. CARLO. Why, I call it ease, to escape the thumb-screw. You perhaps may call stretching upon the rack, basking upon roses; and hope to crown a life of such good works, by the flaming zeal of an act of faith. PAULLO. Ha! how! what Count Vivaldi march in an Auto da fÃ©? for what Carlo? CARLO. Why, don't you know yet? For heresy, man, to be sure. PAULLO. Heresy! they belye him! Upon my soul they do. I never knew a better christian. But how comes the wind to have chang'd? It may be sacrilege to rob a church even of a sucking sister, but sacrilege is not heresy. CARLO. Why, at the examination last night, he was asked whether he never broke in upon an act of penance, and drove away a Monk from the shrine before which he was confessing. PAULLO. Why, I do remember hearing him say that he had shaken up the conscience of a rascally Baldpate, who had done him some shrewd turns. CARLO. That is the subject of his accusation then. You see how far my friendship for you stretches, Paullo. And now I'll trust you with a secret. I am weary of being whipper-in here. I'll retire, and, contrary to received custom, without a pension, give up the keys of office and abscond. You shall accompany me. (Fioresca sings.) PAULLO. But hush! hark! what voice is that? My den must be near the road side. (again.) Listen, again. I know that voice, O bless its sweet pipe. 'Tis my own dear Fioresca. (again.) SONG. A Maiden bewailing her true lover's fate, Along the flinty way, Sadly journeyed night and day, Till she came to his prison gate. CARLO. Would you like to see her? PAULLO. Ask your own heart, man. CARLO. Then you shall. I can open a postern here in the wall, and introduce her.âBut, no raptures mind you. The walls are so unus'd to any sound of joy, it might have a very sad effect upon them. (CARLO goes out, and brings her in to PAULLO.) FIORESCA. Oh, my poor Paullo! PAULLO. My love! (They embrace.) Well, but tell me, you dear rogue, how you have come alone, all this tedious journey, to sing at the door of my cage? FIORESCA. I don't know, Paullo; I needed little by the way; for your misfortune was the only thing I thought about. Love instructed me in a road unknown; and at night, when I lay me down by the way-side, I lifted my thoughts to the Virgin, and rose refresh'd and safe. CARLO. Come, Paullo, you have now a fair opportunity; evening is throwing her grey cloak over the Campagna; we may escape together. FIORESCA. A thousand, thousand blessings on you.â But, Paullo, you are dullâDoes not my Paullo rejoice to see me? PAULLO. O yes, my girl.âBut you must go alone. FIORESCA. Alone! PAULLO. Yes: I must remain here. CARLO. How! is the lad distrasted? PAULLO. No: never more in my senses. I prefer my duty to my pleasuresâI stay here with my master. FIORESCA. Consider, Paullo; you can do him no good; you cannot bear his pain for him. PAULLO. How do you know that? I can bear it with him: and as to the good I may do him, I feel myself, at this moment, how dear is the consolation of one who loves us. (Kisses her.) Fioresca, my good girl, don't try to make me a traitor. The first step from right is fatal; and what security would you have, who cherished a viper in your breast, which you had seen sting the hand that gave it food? FIORESCA. I shall never, never see you more. PAULLO. Why then you have now seen the best of me. FIORESCA. Ah, dear! would masters, think ye, go such lengths for their servants? PAULLO. Why, I don't know, nor is it material: I never knew that attachment was an affair of barter. When my heart tells me it is my duty to stay, I shall never rummage up my brain for motives to run away from it. Carlo will guide you; and I will look after you till my eye-strings crack. TRIO. LOVE no toil regarding, All its pains rewarding, Blessing, distressing, No danger can affright: In love's sweetest anguish, Whilst thrilling with the pain, Who'd not willing languish, Nor think the suffering vain? Then let lovers think them blest, Nor repine at froward fate; In each others arms carest, Their bliss is perfect, tho' 'tis late. [Exeunt CARLO and FIORESCA. SCENEâA Gothic Hall. VIVALDI enters with ELLENA. âVIVALDI. âMy Ellena! do I once more behold thee? âLet this embrace be as the seal of fate, âAnd join our hearts for ever. âELLENA. âO, Vivaldi! âTo see thee thus, in freedom and at ease, âIs such excess of joy, that all the pains âEndur'd since last we met are blotted out, âLike the soft traces of the morning dream.â VIVALDI. But say, my life, how has the interval Of separation wrung that gentle breast? ELLENA. BrieflyâWhen torn from thee, before the altar, I was conducted to a dreary hovel, 'Gainst which the angry sea dashes in vain, The haunt of dark assassins. There Spalatro, At dead of night, had stabb'd me while I rested, But Heav'n was wakeful, though half nature slept, Sent my delivererâand in him a father. VIVALDI. Merciful powers!âa father? Now listen to my tale, which, tho' less perilous, Is not less full of wonder. Hither brought, One night I started from a fev'rish dream Of that dark monk, whom I have told thee of; When lo! close to my couch, the boding phantom Glar'd on me, menacing. His arm was bare, And in his grasp a dagger. In fierce and awful accents he denounc'd Th'assassin who had us'd it; and, for proof, Bade me to call the holy Priest who heard The wretch himself confess the savage murder Of his own wife. Ev'n now I have obey'd him. But O, my Ellen, think of my surprise, To find our foe, Schedoni, was that villain. ELLENA. What said Vivaldi?âWas Schedoni he? Horror of horrors! (she stands in dumb amazement.) VIVALDI. What means my better self?âspeak plainly to me; Destroy me not by this soul-dead'ning stupor. ELLENA. What hast thou done?âA murderer!âSchedoni! Murder a wife!âa mother then!âand Iâ (Faints in his arms. VIVALDI. My senses stagger with this blow unknown. Schedoni!âCan he be then?â'Tis impossibleâ SCHEDONI enters, guarded. SCHEDONI. Nay, shed the blood that scarcely warms her heart; Thy steel were merciful to those rash words, That hellish hatred, levell'd at my life. VIVALDI. Yet tell me, tho' the sound should strike me dead; (And sure, if thou be he, death were most welcome) Speak, and prevent my question. SCHEDONI. Thy worst fears Are realizedâthy vengeance is complete. Thy accusation sinks who came to save thee; Tears from thee thy Ellena.âIn one word, I am her father. VIVALDI. The parent of my love! O fatal rashness! Thus prostrate at your feet behold me, father: In mercy take the life which has destroy'd you. While yet death's counterfeit sits on her brow, And veils the glance, that kills with its reproach, Let me expire; nor ever view those beams, That I have strangled in a sea of blood. SCHEDONI. No, live.âTo die is rapture to the wretched. My Ellenaâsoft, she revives. ELLENA, (coming slowly to herself, at last sees SCHEDONI bending over her, upon which, with a sudden Recollection, she shrieks franticly) My mother! SCHEDONI. I cannot bear this. Lead me to your cells; Employ unheard-of engines to torment me: Your iron whips, your fires, your breaking wheels, Are Eden to the hell that burns within me. [Rushes out. ELLENA (gazing wildly on VIVALDI.) Vivaldi! (then to the Guard) Lead me to the dungeon of my father. [Exeunt severally. The Chamber of secret ExaminationâThe MONK sitting in his Inquisitor's Garb. SCHEDONI brought in. SCHEDONI. Most holy Father, let me break through forms, And, by confession of my crimes, dismiss The frigid toil of slow and creeping proof. I am a wretch for whom no hope remains In being, and do therefore beg to die. ANSALDO. Does this despair proceed from conscience, son? Or from unlook'd for proofs of your offences? SCHEDONI. From both. But deem not that I state it so To shun, by sorrow for repented guilt, One torture of my punishment. By heaven I could as soon clasp Etna in his rage, And think his flaming fountain were the soft Descending shower that dews the breast of earth, As feel the misery that rages in me, And hear of mercy. ANSALDO. Yet subdue despair! It is rebellion to true penitence, Which half obliterates recorded sin, With gentle tears. SCHEDONI. I have been all my life The slave of passion in its fierce excess. I had a wifeâhad! for she lives not now, Whom most injuriously I treatedâShe, Of high indignant spirit, with disdain Requited my neglectâtill jealousy, Of that which I contemn'd, seiz'd on my brain, And made me vigilant o'er which I hated. My jealousy soon singled out an object. One day returning from a wiley absence, I overhear'd what hurried me to frenzy. I hied me to a lattice, and beheld The traitor on his knees before my wife; Whether she rose, resenting his address, Or that she heard my step, I cannot say. I did not pause to question, but straight rush'd, To stab the villain who had wrong'd meâHe Escap'd my vengeanceârage demanded preyâ My wife receiv'd the poinard, and I fled. ANSALDO. O fatal rashness! well do I remember The occasion and the crime. SCHEDONI. How, you remember! ANSALDO. Yes! Count de Bruno! or memory must fail. I was the suitor of your beauteous wife. SCHEDONI. Say, was she innocent! ANSALDO. She was most innocent. Stung with remorse, I hurried from the world And took the cowlâIn the confessional Upon St. Marco's eve, some fourteen years since, Your sorrows in the silence of the night Breath'd through the grate, and waken'd all my own. SCHEDONI. Were you then that Ansaldo! Gracious powers! ANSALDO. Nothing more sure. I sought unknown your convent, Became your friend, to frustrate your designs, And lure that fiend ambition from your breast, Which still you nourish'd in the cloister's gloom. I am the Monk of Fort PaluzziâHe Who sought to snatch Vivaldi from your snare. What more I am, a gentler tongue shall tell. Come forth, Olivia. The Sister, named OLIVIA, at San Stephano, enters. (OLIVIA advances, and throws aside her Veil.) SCHEDONI (starting.) It is my wife, my murder'd innocent. Matilda, speak, art thou thus very she? Or does my guilty mind create the vision, To heighten my despair by vain illusion? OLIVIA. I am Matilda, more rejoic'd to view This change wrought in the heart, than I could be To clasp the wealthy honours of the world, And hear a nation style me sovereign. VIVALDI and ELLENA are brought inâELLENA runs to the feet of OLIVIA. ELLENA. My dear preserverâAh, that veil you gave me SCHEDONI. Didst thou bestow thy veil upon Ellena? OLIVIA. I did; what means? SCHEDONI. Woman, she is thy child. (they fly into each others arms.) ANSALDO. Such is my triumph o'er mistaken passion. A transport greater than ev'n love can give! Or rather, it is love sublim'd and purg'd From all its sensual earthly properties. Enter a Second FAMILIAR. 2d FAMILIAR. Count Vivaldi, yonder is a fellow, The most outrageous that I ever handled. He swears and dancesâsays he'll eat his way Through iron bolts and chains to reach his master. VIVALDI. Let him come to usâ'tis my faithful Paullo. PAULLO (runs in.) PAULLO. What's this? Did I hear truly? Is my master safe? Free from the foul claws of these harpies? I could danceâI could singâI could laugh. Forgive me; but I feel I must cry, or my heart will burst. VIVALDI. But who are theseâPaullo, see who come yonder? CARLO brings in FIORESCA. CARLO. There is no need of flightâBehold him free. âI have fed long enough on sighs and groans, âLet me enjoy a little transport, will you? âThink us not void of feeling, though our office âIt is to punish guilt. Believe me, friends, âThere is no ear that loves the voice of pain. âAnd those tough sinews that apply the torture, âShake often at the work. Nor is his cheek, âWho suffers, th'only one bedew'd with tears.â My fellows come to greet your glad acquittal. SCHEDONI. We thank them heartily. Be happy, children. Matilda, join your benediction with me. May it fall thick in blessedness upon you; And let one throb of charitable pity Soften the censure of your erring father. Come, my Matilda. Our remains of life Shall yet be sooth'd by harmony and peace. Let all who hear me fling away ambition, For O, I know the fury is remorseless, The bonds of duty shrivel in her blaze, And nature is the victim at her altar. PAULLO (to Fioresca.) Do you hear that my delicate anchovy? Fioresca, girl, keep down ambition. I know what heart those eyes aim at, but beware; and yet if it so please my lord Vivaldi, I care not if they hit their mark. VIVALDI. Take her, good Paullo, and my favour with her. SCHEDONI. Now go we on to Naples. There lives one Who must partake our joy, and my regrets. Then will we to the Convent of my love, And praise the power who triumphs in the heart. FINALE. CHORUS. SO shall we all from sorrow rest! So shall our future hours be blest! High heav'n to praise, Our voices raise; And every mercy be confest! PAULLO. In chearful strains, Fioresca, we Will speak our thanks for liberty! FIORESCA. So shall our future transports prove, Heav'n pleas'd to cherish virtuous love! Chorus repeated. THE END.</field>
