      <field name="fulltext">Wit (like the World) is so decrepid grown, It wants some Crutch, or Hint to lean upon. Onely you work alone, it may be said, Your Poems are created, and not made. You frame the stuff too, we but shapes and features; Our Poems are our Children, yours, your Creatures. Just as Gods Poem, Earth; So vast, so fair, Suspended in, not built upon the Ayre. Poys'd by it's self, (like Archimede's Dove,) Your Fancy's made t'exist, as ours to move. We vex the Subject that we write upon, Whil'st all you write is Emanation. Thus you retrive Old Time; for just as then The Golden Age, was but the Iron Men; So to Posterity it may be told Our Age is Iron, but our Wits are Gold. For tell me why, the Golden Age mayn't hence Be stil'd from Wit, as then from Innocence? He that will chuse your Fancy, let him dread To wish for all your Wit, without your Head. What fan's the Ship, the Cock-boat would o're-turn, And what in you's but bright, would else where burn. For Marcyas to be Pan were pretty fair, Too much for Pan t'usurp Apollo's Chair. T. P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholers your Studies, and your Books lay by, Unless you could with Art and Industry Something produce, beyond what here is shown, By one to whom your Learning is unknown; Nature in him th'Effect of Art supplies With stories full of such varieties, And proper Language, for all Humours fit, So wonderful, for Judgement, and for Wit; That onely he, so aptly could Relate, What his high Fancy could alone Create. R. T.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Envy. Thou Snake that lurk'st under the Poets Bayes, Envy, confesse thy Malice to these Playes, Art thou not vext to see the Plotts well lay'd, The Language pure, and every Sentence weigh'd? New Humours? Passion wrought up to that height, Men weep, and yet their grief begets Delight? All this by Nature done, which shows, the Arts Infuse themselves, where they finde Wit and Parts. Out of these Premises we may infer Here will be no work for the Censurer; The wiser Critick will do better first: And for the Foolish, let him do his worst. R. Stapylton.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. THE SCENE In the Island of Citherea. Enter Menetius, and Nearcus; A Messenger meets them. Messenger. My Lords, the Queen sends me to let you know. That she is safe, and her whole Fleet secure. Mene. The Queens safety, is welcome News to all, Though from the Castle top, we saw the fight; None could so clearly the success discern; As to rejoyce for her security! Till you are arriv'd. Ne. Twas bold, &amp; bravely done, with less numbers To Assault so great a Fleet, so near home! I wonder how they got Intelligence? So just, to know the Queens return from Greece. Mess. To Assault us, was far from their design; They fell by chance amongst our Ships ith'night, As they were passing by; found us secure, And unprepar'd for such an accident: So we together sail'd, till Day appear'd; Then our great Admirall, and his brave Son, With their two Squadrons, did begin the Fight: âThe Queens Ship was attacqued on every side, In which, Ormasdes by the Gods was plac'd, That by his hand, Cleandra might be freed, As by a Miracle! her dangers such! And his Achievements so beyond them all! That my Relation, 'would Romance appear, To tell you, how he acted every where. Men. I hope this accident, will now perswade The Queen, that she no more such journies make: Great Princes to such visits and not bound, Where Complements do so great danger bring. Near. Though Cleandras visit, may not admit Of a State Argument to justifie A danger;âShe had reason to return Some high respect, unto the Grecian Court, Where she so long, in so great splendor liv'd; Before she had this Citherean Crown: Nor was it now amiss to shew the Power, And Glory, of so great a Fleet, as Greece Ne're saw before! by which, our renew'd League Will be more valu'd, and our Nation fear'd. Mene. I have no Argument for a dispute; âThis visit past, she needs no other make; But Sir, how comes Ormasdes here again? What great Affair, occasions his return? Near. How can the Grecian Empire so long spare, So great a Captain? and so much belov'd. Messen. That happy Emperour; who has no War, Did give Ormasdes liberty once more, To grant Cleandras sute for his return, That he may now confirm, what he has won, Least his late Trophies in the Zelnian War, Be tumbled down! for we may doubt! those Kings Who border Zelnia, will not long indure Such loss; as will Cleandras Crown secure. Though her great Ancestor that Kingdom won, And left it to his most unhappy Son; Who all those Princes Tributaries made, That in Affection call'd him to their Aide. Mene. Heark Nearcus, heark how the People shout! As if the Queen were now, come near the shore; Pray Sr. c?mand the Guards advance with speed, Unto the Port; Nearcus I do fear, The Queen may land, while we are trifling here. [Exit. Enter Cleandra Queen of Citherea, Ormasdes a Prince of Greece. Her General with his Arme in a Scarfe Old Titus Admiral, Young Titus, Lords, Ladies, and Train. Admi. The Gods have given you a full Victory, And all your Fleet will be in Port, by Noon. Queen. I have thank'd the Gods Titus, and do see Yours, and your Sons mirits, in this great work: But have not words that can express my thanks To brave Ormasdes, for preserving me; Had you seen my danger, when the bold Turks With assured Victory, my Labin forc't! And how by his hand from that Ruine freed! You would with me admire, if not adore The force which Rescued, with so great a Power My fear, my wonder, and my joy, so mixt, I had no time for any thought betwixt My danger, and my safe deliverance, Which did the Price of that great work inhance! The bloody Trophies of Ormasdes sword; Surpas'd what Mars to Hector did afford. Ormasdes faints, and leans on Young Titus. Adm. He faints, this remove to Land, makes him weak; âHow do you Sir? Ormas. My soul Titus, shrunk away, much asham'd, To hear my service by Cleandra fam'd, To much for any modest man to own, That my weak Arm, should rescue her alone! Quee. I am amaz'd, thus suddainly to find The Gods so cruel, who have been so kind! Thus to Eclips the joyes they freely gave, Shews they repent the mercy which did save; Ormasdes death will now so dismall be, I cannot sacrifice for Victory. Unless the Fates this mischief do divert! It will our Triumphs, into Tears convert. Y. Tit. âHis wounds shew not the danger you conceive; Madam, you Prophesie so great an ill, The Fates themselves will tremble to fulfill. Ormas. I am well Madam, only blush to hear, That my slight wounds, should be so much your care If great Cleandra, do mean Acts admire, Brave men will not to high Attemps aspire. Enter to them, Nearcus, Cleobulus, and Cithareans, they Kiss Cleandras hand, a noyse of joy within from the People. Cleo. Madam, the Publick joy for your return, Does shew how much we did your absence mourn. Qu. My Peoples joy brings me great happiness, And your love my Lords, my true value has: But still I must your gratitudes, direct Unto Ormasdes, by whose powerfull hand, Cleandra was preserv'd, and now restor'd. Ormas. Madam, you reward my small endeavors don, With praise above, the merrit of a man! Queen. I can afford Ormasdes as much Worth, And Honour, as the Antient Heroes had, So he will me such gratitude allow, As sutes with my great benefits receiv'd;â âWhat Fleet Nearcus, lies within our Port? Near. 'Tis from Treconia Madam, here's Arriv'd A brave Embassadour, from that great King, Who here has long expected your return; His Equipage is Rich, and with him shines, A Lady he calls Sister; hither come, To wonder at the Glories of your Court, While we do all admire, their Princely Port! Qu. He shall have present Audience, to excuse His long attendance; give him a respect: Beyond the reach, or thought of a neglect; âDo you Nearcus, bring him to us now;â [Exit Nearcus.] âCleobulus, what news from Zelnia? Cl. The frontiers have been frequently attaqu'd, Since you went hence, but no great damage done. Ormas. I beg the Honour Madam to chastise those haughty Rebells, for their Insolence. Q. The whole world knows, Ormasdes can c?mand The fortune of a war; why then should you? As if your Name were yet obscure! desire New dangers? But you covet a Renown, Beyond the value of the Zelnian Crown; Else, you'd secure my People from their fear, By your consent to be my Vice-Roy there. Or. Such proffer'd gifts from Princes are not us'd To be molested, and much less refus'd! Ormas. But I must not your Majesty permit, To load me with an honour so unfit! As will Eclips the merrit you allow, When gifts shine brighter, then my Actions do. Qu. Is there no way Ormasdes to remove These niceties? must I for ever own Your benefits? and make you no return! How little do I seem to your great Eye? Who scorn I should your service gratifie. Ormas. I have in Greece, all my relations left, To serve you Madam, and am hither come, With a fixt zeal to wish, and to obey, What ever you command! and only fear My inclinations may my tongue direct, To beg what you'l deny: though I affect. Qu. Though I your sute dislike, I will consent, And from your happiness, raise my content. Or. With your permission Madam, I would beg Leave to retire unto the little Lodge, Within the Forrest, half a League from hence, Where after all my Travells, I may find, Ease for my body, and refresh my mind, With the soft solace of a private life, Free from Affairs, and Courts Eternal strife. Qu. This is far beyond my fears Ormasdes! Tis no wonder you my favours slight! When you do our society dislike. But I will not your purpose now oppose, Though I your councils, &amp; your frindship lose; Who in debates can speak; in fight command, And order all, that in disorder stand;â âCan nothing alter your desire from this? Ormas. Not unless, troubles be prefer'd to bliss. Queen. Ormasdes it shall be as you desire, And freely, when you please, you may retire. Or. Though I a while absent my self from Court, I shall be ready to lay by my Books, When you do call me to put Armour on, Stories tell that great men the like have don. Qu. Though I know no example, I believe What e're Ormasdes shall make choice to do, May be a president, that will ingage Brave men to follow, in the future age. Ormas. Your Majesty in this, has given me more content Then all the favours proffer'd me before. [Exit Ormasdes. Y. Tit. Is this his humour? or some fancy grown From passion for some Love, to us unknown; Qu. No Titus, he has ever been observ'd, A great contemner of Amores, and does True friendship more esteem, then idle Love. Ti. The more like now to be so much concern'd When touch'd; our mortal bodies are so frail, That we may love, and know not what we ail! Why, does your Majesty think friendship can With as much force as love, transport a man? Qu. Not to such frensies, as wild brains Create, When fancy cannot change the course of Fateâ âWhen love to faces, with the face decay, A virtuous friendship will for ever sway.â âI wish you Titus, when he first retires, To try how far your friendship can prevail, To get the secret from Ormasdes soul; Tis for his good, that he his griefs impart; True friendship will allow a little Art, When the design does nothing more import, But bringing of Ormasdes back to Court. Tit. I shall be joy'd, and happy if I can Bring back to Court! so Excellent a Man. Enter An Officer and Ormasdes. Officer. The Embassadour attends your Majesty. The Queen sits. Queen. Admit Him. Enter Embassadour, and his Train. Embas. Madam, my Master, the Treconian King, Salutes you in these Letters, and by me, Congratulates your Zelnian Victory; But does lament, that he no share acquir'd, In that great Conquest, he so much desir'd: He was ambitious Madam, to command In that near War, and not as neuter stand. When strangers merits do such Triumphs claim, While he to you unknown, sat still with shame. But since Ormasdes conduct, and his skill, With such high Valour, has fulfill'd your will. He envies not so great a Souldiers praise, But would have shar'd in his Triumphant rayes. Qu. If I had known Valerianus mind, He might my thanks have shar'd, and not repin'd. Emb. I have commission also, to propose A League between your Kingdoms, &amp; your selves, Such, as new Conquer'd Zelnia will secure, That Cithereas peace may long endure.â âYour beauty Madam, more then Crowns invite, Valerians wishes to unite Your hearts; and then, your Scepters may Be doubly fixt, when both do love obey. He begs, that he in person may appear, To plead his love, and treat this great affair. Qu. Valerianus friendship I approve, But never shall consent to treat of love; 'Twould raise my dead Lords Ashes in his Urn, If I should to a second Lover turn? Your great Kings proffer'd League, I do imbrace, With fit Affection, and a chearful face:â Declairing to the World, how I respect, His person, though I must his sute reject. Emb. I shall acquaint my Master,âand beg leave I may your Majesties commands receive, Without the Ceremonies that belong, To a State audience, in a formal throng. Qu. You shall have free access, as you desire, And now my Lord, I must a Sutor be, That fair Mariana will appear, Who I am told is come to visit me. Emb. That Madam, should have been my next request, That you my dearest Sister would permit, To kiss your hand, who does attend without. Qu. Will you Ormasdes please to bring her in?â [Exit Ormasdes. âIf I had known that she had been so near, She had been better treated for your sake. Emb. You oblige me Madam. Enter Ormasdes, with Mariana and her Ladies; the Queen Salutes Her. Qu. You do me, and my Country, honour more, Then any Lady ever did before. Mari. I have done my self a favour Madam, And tis your Majesty that honours me; The fame of Citherea I confess, May Princes hither bring, but my address, Is to Cleandras self, that I might see, The virtue fam'd for such Divinitie. Qu. Madam, if you such flatteries throw out, You will your welcome spoil, and make me doubt You rather come to mock, then to admire! On such another word? I shall retire. Mari. I can be silent Madam, while I live, But must speak truth, when you this freedom give. Qu. We then will change our argument, &amp; place, Least I do chide, whom I intend to grace. [Exeunt all but Nearcus and Cleobulus. Cleob. Did you observe, with what forc'd modesty The Embassadour supprest his anger? When his Masters sute, so briskly was denied. Nea. Yes, and how suddain his sad looks change, When bright Cleandra did so soon admit His private visits; as if himself were struck! And did no further press his Masters Sute. Cle. I have other thoughts, that made me believe, The Lady he calls Sister, is his Love. Near. Such things have been, and Mariana may His Mistris be; whose beauty in my Eye, Does far surpass Cleandras Majesty. And now you put these thoughts into my head, I did observe Marianus eyes and his, Did a long practiz'd silent language shew, While they by turns did entertain the Queen. Cleob. But I had second thoughts, led me to think, I did sometimes perceive Marianas eyes, On brave Ormasdes fixt; and seem'd to take Such a survey, as Purchasers do make. Near. I doubt Mariana has not an estate, To purchase him, at great Cleandras rate. Cleo. Let us observe them better next, and see If it be Art; or their simplicitie. [Exeunt. Enter Embassadour, and Mariana. Emb. I have undone my self, Mariana! For now beyond resistance I do love; And find Cleandra will by her neglects, Dash all my hopes, and turn from my respects, Mari. There does not a just cause to me appear, For such a doubt; much less to raise dispair: Because Cleandra runs not at first sight, Into the arms, of such a wandring Knight. Though your State Arguments cannot procure To Treat; she may but a short Siege indure, When as your self, a King you do appear, The Castle may be won, by love, or fear. Emb. No Mariana, I have heard, and seen Too much, the brave Ormasdes stands between Me, and my happiness, his retirement Is to cloak their close love, and to prevent Pretenders; or such scandal, as would rise, If openly in Court, without disguise! Such unproportion'd love should ere be known, Which shews they dare not their affections own. Ma. What need such diss?bling? to hide that love, Which all the Cithereans do approve; And publickly do pray, his great Renown, Might be rewarded with Cleandras Crown. To publick fame, I therefore credit give, They not in love, but in true friendship live. Em. Such friendship between man, &amp; woman, may 'Mongst silly people make a holy day. No Callenders of mine, shall ere admit Of a red Letter, for a counterfeit. Mari. The Gods defend Brother. Emb. Why Mariana? what is your concern? To blush, because we do their crimes discern! Can you believe, that a Platonick flame, Has power to Cannonize Cleandras Name? Mari. I blush for you, who now so boldly dare, Against the person that you love! declare. Emb. Your words, and looks, do not at all agree, But shame for your Ormasdes infamie. He is the man in Marianas eye, Whose blushes, would his vices justifie. Mari. Though I his virtues honour, and admire The glorious Actions of his life, my heart, Is not in any danger to be lost. Emb. When a heart is so well lost Mariana! 'Twill soon be found, I did believe my own, As fast fixt as yours, and yet at first sight, Of the fair Queen, 'twas from its center forc'd. Mari. I Brother, your business was to lose it. Emb. But the blind Deity considers not Our purposes he wounds at randome still;â âI wish thou wouldst ingeniously confess, If in thy thoughts; Ormasdes be not grown The handsomest and gallantest of Men; Whose famous actions, in our western World, May well excuse thy wonder, and thy Love;â âI wish thy beauties could his heart ingage, That I might have no Rival for the Queen. Mari. To oblige my dear brother, I will try, What may be done, for your security. Emb. Thy whole life, never can oblige me more; âOrmasdes is a great Prince in Greece, And I for thee, will make him greater yet, By my additions in Treconia; If you can think him worthy of your Love? âOur forces joyn'd, may double conquest gain, When seve'rd; both indeavours may prove vain. Mar. While you talk thus, I had as good confess: What you so much believe, and do allow, I gladly would obtain, if I knew how. Emb. That was well said, let us to Councel thenâ Suppose I Court the Queen in my own shape? Mar. I think tis best that you do first inquire, How far the subtle Queen does stand ingaged Unto Ormasdes, that you may not kneele To her, if she unto another bow? Emb. It will not be amiss, that I inquire, Of some great man in power, who I may bribe:â Such as Cleandras trust does most admit, To plead my Masters cause, and argue it:â âWhat if I first Ormasdes self do try? Twill search his love, and his fidelity. Mari. I am not fit to judge, nor can advise; But will with prayers, assist your enterprize. Emb. I'le visit him, and if he guilty be, I shall confound his great securitie. Mari. I fear you sooner will your self destroy, Then by your furious passions him anoy. Emb. Will, you go with me to Ormasdes Lodge? Least I disturb his solitary Soul, And with my rude breath, harm the man you love. Mari. I'de rather be the subject of your mirth, Then great Ormasdes should such rage discern, As from your Arguments will soon arise. Emb. No, I'le approach him with my gentle looks, As calm, and smoath, as Virgins when they smile, Such as our tender yielding hearts beguile; But if Ormasdes do a lover prove! He will my hopes and fears to anger move;â âDo you attend the Queen, till my return. [Exeut severally. Enter Ormasdes, a Book in his hand, as talking to Young Titus. Ormas. I never liv'd, till now you think me deadâ Does my dear friend believe, what I have said? Y. Tit. Sir, if the friendship you allow, be more Then an Airie name? you will now permit That I as freely speak, as I do love. Orm. Titus friendship would have honored Cato, And now my self am prouder of advise From Titus, then for all my victories. Tit. Thus then Cleandra thinks, and so do I, This loneness will your sorrows multiply; Passions conceal'd, do nourish discontent, But if reveal'd, much mischief may prevent: Tis my ambition to obtain this trust, If great Ormasdes thinks I dare be just. Ormas. By all ourâI know no discontent, Nor has my quiet brest a passion in't.â Titus. Hold Ormasdes, hear me out; who now come To let you know, that I, and many more Who love you, do believe that you repine, Because Cleandra is so much reserv'd; And dare not own the passion that you have. âIf this be your trouble, trust it to me; And you shall soon perceive, what I can do, In satisfaction to your highest wish: âI do so far incourage, and assure, What I have mentioned; Is the Nations hope; Who pray that great Cleandra may comply In all, that will Ormasdes satisfie Thus my affection, has my heart exprest, And I expect an answer I may trust. Ormas. What you have uttered Titus; I believe, And scorn to think such friendship, can deceive. By the same sacred tye, I you conjure, To credit me, who seriously do vow. I only chose this solitary life, To ease my body, and repose my mind; I have no passion, nor do grief sustain, Nor have a wish beyond Cleandras smile, And Titus friendship; which I'le near beguile. Titus. Sir, I am bound to credit what you say, And shall no more endeavour by discourse, To alter such well grounded purposes: But must we never hope for your return? To Court? where you with the same freedom may Enjoy what private hours you can desire, And not thus put the World so wholly off; Which surely was, with all its glories made, For use of man, and its felicities To be by us injoyed; without a crime. Ormas. Yes Titus, but we vain men mistake, And from our fickle Infancy propose, Glittering felicities we never find, For as we grow up to the injoyments Of what riper years bring with them, we see That our desires do daily higher grow And our fruitions but foundations lay, T'entertain our busie brains, a new way. So that we seldome contentation have, In what we do possess; but forward look, And only find some pleasure in the way, Towards the end we aime at; which obtain'd, Brings not those real joyes, we did expect; Only affords some relish which invites Our idle fancies, to seek new delights; âHow unhappy then, is our best happiness? When no fruitions, can our fond hearts bless. Still subject to unsatisfied desires, That from quench'd Ashes, does beget new Fire. Thus all our Appetites, do make us slaves, And from our cradles lead us to our graves. Young Titus. Has the Gods only given us active souls? And no objects, fit for them to fix on? Orma. To think on those Gods, will afford our hearts A full variety, of lasting joyes; VVith which our earthly fancies cannot mix, VVhen on CÅlestial happiness, we fix. Titus. I shall e're long, this argument revive, And shew, how you are buried alive! Where is that valor, and that virtue gon? Whither that courage fled? I doated on. Though you can passion, and desire sustain, You must not quit the Court, as if disdain Of all the glories that a Court can give, Could not perswade you there again to live. âI must now leave you to attend the Queen;â [Exit Titus Ormas. A clearer virtue I have never seen. [Exit omnes severally. Enter the Queen, Embassador, Mariana, Old Titus, and Train. Embassador. Madam, shall I return without a hope? No gratious answer to my Masters sute! Queen. My Lord, I fully have declar'd, that way. Embassador. Never to marry Madam! Queen. Tis my opinion now. Embassador. Will you permit my Master to appear? Whose person may bring Arguments to prove, It necessary to allow his Love. Queen. By no means my Lord, I shall not admit His visit, if he come on that affair! But must against his coming now declare. Embass. How can you Madam, thus declare against A person, and a passion you see not? Or prejudge, what you will think hereafter! His presence, may change this severity. Queen. I have consider'd all that can be said, Urge it no more. Exit Queen, and Train. The Embassador stands concern'd. Ma. Brother,âSir,âwhat do you ail? what strange looks Do you put on? you will be discovered! Emba. I Mariana, tis now my business, To try if this Scene changing, may not change Cleandras stubborn heart; when she shall see This borrow'd habit, thrown away; if then, She scorn my Love! I will break off the League And in my own Right will a VVar declare, For her so lately conquer'd Zelnian Crown, And there will try, if her conceal'd Gallant! The great Ormasdes may once more be drawn From Sanctuary, to defend her Right, From my just rage;âI will now visit him. Mari. This humour is not fit for complement, Emb. Fear not Mariana, I'le not wrangle now, My business is to bribe that mighty man, And make him plead my cause to the fair Queen, âBut if I find him rotten at the heart! I shall unmask him, spite of all his Art. Mari. That is what I fear. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Second Act. Enter the Embassadour, with Ormasdes, who holds a Book in his hand, they sit on Chairs by a Table. Ormasdes. Your Lordship by this visit, honours me; Emb. My visit brings you business of the State, You must not take it for a Complement. Ormas. What is your business then? Emb. I have observed Ormasdes, the Queens sence, Is yours, in her Affairs of Consequence, She moves by you; this brings me to consult My Masters Marriage, for a full result! For I conceive Valerianus Name Of so great Credit! and so high a Fame! That our two Nations, by our Princes joyn'd; Though our surrounding neighbors were c?bind, Our Territories would be safe, and we Should thank the Gods for such Tranquilitie. But when a Lady Rules, they may presume, And their Rebellious Principles assume; If great Ormasdes shall be call'd away, And fair Cleandra left alone to sway. Ormasdes. I know Sir, that Cleandra does esteem The stout Treconians friendship, as she ought; And I know she honours your brave young King, Whose martial acts have gain'd him through the world, A character so noble, and so great! That she with joy this proffer'd League, does treat. Onely dislikes the Marriage you propose On good State Arguments, as I suppose, In judgement, and affection to her Son, She will not raise a Rival to his Crown. And for her angry Neighbours, she believes The late Zelnian war, has such wisdome taught, They will not suddainly, unurg'd, provoke, A Queen, so powerfull, and so fortunate. Embassador. Suppose Valerianus take offence? And look on this neglect as an affront! Because he only did propose this League, To introduce his sute, which he conceives, VVill both our Nations equally advance; But if laid by with scorn! suppose he then, Do joyn with your old Enemies? and claim His Fathers Title to the Zelnian Crown; VVhat may the hazzards? and the issue be? If a new war, dispute your Victory? Ormasdes. I will not Prophecy the sad event, That so unjust a war, may justly bring Upon so Gallant, and so wise a King! Embass. Suppose then, that I have his Commission? To lay by the Treaty of this new League, Untill the Marriage be agreed unto; And if deni'd! I must Proclaim his Right To Zelnia; and your late Conquest bring, To a new question, with a Powerfull King. Ormas. If Valerianus be so fixt, we must No hazzards fear, in wars that are so just. Embass. Your great success have high thoughts begot, Above your Conquest, which I value not? But wish such evils as we now foresee, May be avoided by our industry; For 'twill become your Wisdom, and your Trust, T'advise Cleandra to this happy Match, Wherein if you prevail! I have full power, Now to confer on you, the first, and best Of our Treconian Principalities. Ormas. You do me wrong, and are in this unjust, To think that I will break Cleandras trust, Which I do value 'bove your Masters Crown! And therefore boldly will advise the Queen Not to admit his sute, on Arguments Which must an evil consequence produce To her Sons Right, if she Comply, And by it lessen her own Dignity. Embass. If my imployment, anger did allow, And my own Honour would permit, to strike A-Book-man! this rude language, I'de correct. Orm. If the Queens honour were not more concern'd! In a respect to your imployment due; You soon should find, how little I do value you! The Book-man would not from your Master take This Insolence; but for Cleandras sake I do forbear; pray visit me no more. Embassador. Fear it not; when Valerianus knows How little worth, Cleandras honour is! He will this League, and her Alliance scorn; Who puts Ormasdes into this Disguise, To hide her Lover from her Peoples Eyes? Ormasdes. This is beyond sufferance. Ormasdes Grapples with the Embassador Enter The Queen, Young Titus, and Train, who part them. Queen. Hold Ormasdes, I heard his Insolenceâ âSir, you have leave to go aboard your Fleet, Where you only can be safe; begon then, Without reply be gone; for if't be known! What you have said! my People may revenge My wrong, before your Master do me right.â [Exit Embassador in Anger.] âOrmasdes you must in this, my will obey, Your wonted Judgement, must your passion sway: While I by a quick war, with Fire and Sword, Require such Justice as he must afford. Ormas. Madam, the Conduct of that war I beg; Queen. If you this passion will lay by till then! You shall: But no more of this anger now; I came to take the Ayre this After-noon, But will defer it, till another day. âPray be pacifi'd, you shall not stir out; I do intreat, and do command you stay. Titus stay you, till this heat be over. [Exit Queen and Train.] Ormas. Titus, my friend; I have a flame within, That will consume my heart, if you help not! Yo. Tit. Do you doubt my assistance, to serve you, In any way you can prescribe a friend? Or. I'le rather thank thee for't, then doubt thy love, Th'Embassador can this night hardly reach Coriola! where we, in a swift Boat By break of day, to morrow may Arrive; If some hours since! we in the dark, Imbarke! Yo. Titus. I guess your purpose, and I will obey; Yet I would gladly have an Argument, To justifie what we intend to do; Lest Forreign Princes should condemn our State, That Laws of Nations rashly violate; And so Cleandras honour, suffer more, Then by his Insolence, she did before. Ormas. How can he justifie, those words he spoke? His rude language, the Law of Nations broke. For when a Publick Minister puts off That sacred shadow, which should him protect; And dares in such vil'd language give affronts, To a much greater Monarch then his own! That minute, his Commission did expire; When he his Cloak of Majesty laid by; And like a Ruffen, talk'd so lavishly. Yo. Titus. This I confess, is reason for revenge, But if the World our action not approve? Pray think, what we shall urge for our excuse, In case we can no president produce? Ormas. A president Titus! where will he show, That Nations do Embassadors allow To be so barbarously base, as he? When he dares make his Act, a president! I will another shew, and kill him for't. In the first Age, no presidents, were known, And in ours, this shall be my Creation: Tis not Cleandras work, nor is it thine; The glory, or the shame is only mine. Titus my heart would break, if I permit That man to brag, as he will do at home; How he has brav'd Ormasdes to his face! And on Cleandra thrown so foul disgrace. Y. Tit. Since I your resolution cannot change, Pray name the place, and hour, and I'le not faile. Ormas. Some 3. hours hence, we'l at the Ferry meet, Where a swift well-man'd Boat, you must provide, My motion may some jealousie beget, Of what we do intend; and must perform; If our best speed, can but this Mad-Man reach, I shall his fury, better manners teach. [Exeunt. Enter Cleandra, Mariana, Old Titus, Cleobulus, and Ladies. Queen. Madam, you are now got so near my heart, That I am sad to think that we must part. Mariana. And I too soon do find, that I too late, Am now involved in my Brothers Fate. We leave our hearts behind, though we now fly, This place by our impulsive Destiny. My soul has not a wish can send me hence, If I could stay on any just pretence. Queen. Why may you not stay here Mariana? And let him go, we will a friendship make, Such as thy virtue justly may expect, And my affection give, if here you'l live? Mari. I am unhappy Madam, who must be At his dispose, has done you injurie So great! that I must suffer while I live. Queen. Rather then you shall suffer, I'le forgive Mari. Your pardon is, beyond your power, I fear, Unless you will admit his Master here? Queen. His pardon then, is far beyond my reach, If for his King, his own concern be such! And yours, so much for him; I must consent To part with both; yet I could be content, To see him for your sake, I and forget, What he so rashly has against me said, Thy tears for him, have satisfaction made. Mari. My Brother is already on his way, And has ordered Boats for me to follow, Where I expect to find his rage to high, To hearken to such mercy, as I bring, Unless Cleandra will admit his King! Queen. I have not seen such useless rage before, Whom but himself? can his mad fury harm? Mari. It is a Riddle I dare not expound. Queen. Dare not Mariana? am I so low In your Esteem? you dare not let me know What you dare do? this secret I confess, Has only power to make me love thee less. Mari. I cannot, I have sworn not yet to say What 'tis, to him I'me doubly tied t'obey: But since your goodness, can so soon forgive, So great a Crime, I'le try to bring him back, And if I can prevail, for his consent, I'le shew the cause of his distemperment.â Queen. You have his pardon, and may now persue Your own design, to bring him back with you; But if he chuse to go, and set you free, Your self shall be much welcomer to me. Mar. Your words incourage me to take no leave, But cherish hopes which may my heart deceive With present thoughts rather to smile then mourn As a good Omen to my quick return. Queen. You Nearcus, shall conduct Mariana To Coriola, and at your own house, As you pass by; pray treat her as my friend. Nearcus. I shall be carefull in it Madam. Exeunt Nearcus, and Mariana. Queen. I love her, and am somewhat more concern'd To part with her; then I can make you see! Admiral. She has by her behaviour, gain'd esteem From all the Court, and from the Nation to. Queen. I wonder Titus none of you lament, When so great Beauty from the Court is sent! Admi. Your Majesty has shew'd enough for all. Queen. I do mean Love Titus, and did expect, Her beauty should have fir'd a hundred hearts! And by the powerfull charms of her bright Eyes, O're-ruled, our Citherean Destinies. Admi. My heart Madam, has been so often burnt, There is no substance left, that can take fire; Indeed I wonder how the rest have scap'd! Cleob. Nearcus, and my self, had other thoughts! Of this great beauty, which did secure us; We do Mariana for his Mistris take, Few Sisters Travel for a Brothers sake! Queen. How Cleobulus! have you any ground For this? to justifie so vile a thought; Cle. Only the freedom, which they daily us'd, With this new way, for Men who have no Wives, To carry Sisters, into Foreign Courts! Queen. Though not in use, it does not sure deserve A censure so severe! such Innocence, In Mariana, did to me appear, That I should sooner judge her good, if bad! Then blemish such perfections by a thought It cannot be! so Insolent a Guilt! He durst not own! nor such a scandal raise, On his own Name! and on his Country too! I do command you to suppress this thing, I am asham'd a Cithereans heart, Should entertain a thought of such a crime! We bring our own Worth in question then, When we asperse the Worth of other men. Cle. They were but thoughts, as rashly then tain up, As now thrown out; with no design to wrong The Innocent; I wish her virtue may Our thoughts convince, and she be justified. Queen. Keep firm there my Lord, for all those who live Near Princes Eares, should weigh how they let fall A word, that may a Womans Honour blast; If I were apt to credit your report? And on your groundless jealousie affront Such virtue! what a sin were it in you? To make me guilty of so great a Crime! Cleobulus. I am sorry for my rash opinion, Since it offends your Majesty so much! Queen. It is the baine of Courts, when we permit Those near us, to asperse the Innocent; If our strict Laws for petty theft, gives Death? How much a greater punishment is due For Robbing a good name? a sin so vil'd, And so unknown! no punishment was made By way of Prophesie, for crimes to come! If I did think this malice from your heart, I would for ever banish you my Court. Cleobulus. Your Majesty does raise your anger now Above my guilt; which had no mischief in't. Queen. I am no farther angry with you now, But take occasion to declare my sence, Against all such as defame Innocence. 'Tis a Prince his chief business to be Just, The Gods impose on us no higher Trust! We have no petty faults, to answer for, Universal Justice, is our great work, And those who shall divert it, to destroy The Fame, or Fortune of an Enemy, Deserves to be thrown off with Infamy. [Exit Queen and Ladies. Remains the Admiral and Cleobulus. Admiral. I have not seen the Queen in such a heat! You have offended her some other way? Cleobulus. Not that I know of, in this kind ever! Admi. What Devil, made you talk thus to her now? You knowing that she is so good herself, She makes a doubt, that any of her Sex Can do amiss! and tis great Nobleness! Cleo. There is a kind of pixe Devil, dwells In many Courts, that haunts our idle heads; And prompts us, when we know not what to say; To Entertain great Princes with reports Of others so to please and pass the time; This foolish spirit, I think, entred me. Admiral. You gave Cleandra cause, for your reproof, For how can Princes judge Malice, for Mirth? When cunningly thrown out, with specious shews, Of probabilities; when those aspers'd, Are never call'd, to answer for themselves; The Queen did Excellently well, to chide You, whom she loves; that none may ere presume The like hereafter! for if Princes be Born Credulous? Malitious persons may Defame a Nation, if they please! this way. Cleobulus. I know I was to blame, but from this day, I'le hold my peace, till I know what to say. [Exeunt. Enter Nearcus, with Mariana and Servants at his House. Mari. Where are we now my Lord? this house stands well. Nearcus. It is my poor habitation Madam; Here I must treat you by the Queens command, 'Tis the mid-way unto Coriola. Mariana. 'Tis a Noble, and a most pleasant Seat; Has it no Mistris Sir? Are you single? Nearcus. I am only that way, happy Madam; Mariana. You have a Mistris then? or do you call It happiness? that you as yet, have none? Nearcus. Will you please Madam, to view the garden? Exit Nearcus with Mariana. The rest of the Train stay looking on the Pictures, and see them not go out. 1. Lady. That piece methinks, does look as if it liv'd. 2. Lady. I do prefer that smiling Figure first; Whose hand is it my Lord? Lord. I have not skill enough to know the hands, Though I love Pictures:âpray observe the next; Is not this sleeping Venus, rarely done? See how that Cupid in the Tree stands off! 2. Lady. Tis rare indeed, that Satyr, and the rest, Of the whole piece, is excellently good! 1. Lady. Let us look into the next room my Lord; Lord. This way they went, &amp; this way must return. They go out, and return hastily. Lord. The doors are lock'd, and we can pass no way. 1. Lady. Is this by accident? or on command? Lord. Let us attend a while, and we shall see; From the next Chamber window, where they be. [Exeunt. Enter Nearcus with Mariana in the Garden. Mariana. I have no Argument for further talk, And now am weary grown, with this long walk; Where is the beauty? you so much admire! Your praises, have in me rais'd some desire To see this wonder of our Sex! that I, May judge your skill, and with your choice c?ply. Nearcus locks the door, and kneeles. Nearcus. She is here already, oh she is here! A brighter beauty, never can appear! Mari. Why d'ye lock the door my Lord? why kneele To me? you make my heart some tremblings feele, By this surprise; and I do doubtfull stand, What of kind Treachery you have in hand! It looks!âyet, like a Lionness betray'd Into the Toyles; I scorn to be afraid. Nearcus. I have no Argument for either now, But a distracted heart; that knows not how T'excuse, what I have done!âtis love has brought Me to this Precipis, and too late taught, That I from hence, shall head-long tumble down, If you disdain to save; oh do not frown! Offers his Sword. Rather take this, and while you may, prevent Your own near ruine, and my rash intent.â âThat angry look, and those enraged Eyes, Pierce like quick Lightning, from the stormy skies; They melt my heart, &amp; make me trembling stand, To beg what Love, and Nature may Command. Mariana. Love, do the Cithereans by such Arts! Such force! and treachery! win Ladies hearts? Fie, fie Nearcus, this does not agree With Love! nor with Cleandras trust to thee; I shame to find such ills! and blush to chide: âRepent, and I thy Infamy will hide; Oh! tis the basest of all crimes to be Justly condemn'd, for infidelity; And with a treachery, my trust beguile, Beyond the story of the Crocadile. Ne. What dares not love attempt? when it goes high Like mine? your ships are ready, oh to nigh! The wind is fair; and I, no time but this, To woe; no other means to reach my bliss! The Queens command, and my desires here meet, To throw my life, and fortune, at your feet That by this desperate course, you now may see, Your love, or scorn, I make my destenie. Mari. Nearcus, how would you prevail my dreams! Instruct me not, to answer such extreams! Nearcus. I would have you Mistris of me, and mine, Before we part, made so, by vowes Divine: Mariana. Tis a short warning, to a work so great! Is this Cleandras Love? and this your Treat To strangers? do you think my lips, my heart Does hold so loose? as at first sight, to part With it to you? what do you find in me So slight? that looks like so much levitie. Nearcus. If you'l afford more time? I will proceed With caution, and respect! and shall take heed How I offend; if you'l resolve to stay, Or to comply, my passion will obey. âIf not! I must this desperate course persue, And trust my ruine, or success, to you âWho does in desperate attempts ingage, Can seldome at first sight, th'event presage: âLove led me on, and reason comes to late, Now to retreat; this Fortune, is my Fate. Mar. Your language, &amp; your looks, do rather threat, Then woe: which does in me such scorn beget, As to an Enemy, that does invade âThat Innocence you have bereft of aid; And boldly dare impose on a free heart, What should be won by Love, not such base art! Nearcus. Give me but time to woe! and I will fear, And tremble in your sights with zeal appear, And the same duty, I approach the Gods, When my offences, make me fear their Rods! It is not I, (as your affairs do stand) But high necessity, makes me command; That all the remnant of my life, you may Triumph! for my ambition's to obey. Mariana. Think you by force, that I shall ere think fit, To yield my self to such a counterfiet? I am not born unto so mean a Fate, As to submit unto the man, I hate: Nor will I be thus frighted, to comply, With so contemptable a destiny. Nearcus. I must confess, I can by no disguise Lessen, or hide, the guilt, of this surprize; But by some greater crime, more amply shew, That a distracted passion may soon know, To act such evills, as I fear to think; But do not set me in despair thus sink. Speak so, as that I may, some hope retain, And you'l restore me to my self again. Mari. Stand by vil'd Man, and let me pass; who waits? Near. None within call; that now can help! the fates Themselves have not the power to set you free, Nor can you hope for safety, but from me! No storm at Sea, nor in it, ships on fire, Creates more terrours, then my wild desire, Brings me! here is a Tempest in this brest, Above all them; since raging Love possest My heart, I am become a walking storm; Reason, and Virtue, are both wrack'd, no form Observ'd, while this confusion bears the sway, None knows to govern; but must all obey, If we cannot resist; then to cry no, Is madness, when we must to ruine go! Maria. I have no power, but must my Brothers will Obey; I must his mind, not yours fullfill; Lest his great pride, and anger may destroy, What you'd preserve, and frustrate all your joy. Nearcus. If my high birth, and quality do prove Less then your own, I will expect no love; But hazzard all my hopes, on his consent, Let his denial, sign my punishment. Mariana. If your birth equal mine, and he consent To joyn our hands! I have no argument Against your hopes; but must be Mistris still, Of my own heart; not part with my free-will; Yet now Nearcus, I do promise you, What truth and honour dictates, I will do. Nearcus. Unless you both do ere you go, comply, You shall soon see, that I know how to dye. Mari. Pray call my servants down, that I may see Your truth, and find my self at Liberty. [He calls at the door. Nearcus. Now Madam, that my life's at your dispose, Your self secure, I humbly do propose, You will before the Gods, confirm by vow, What you have freely promis'd, to me now. Mari. By all those powers, I'le keep my promise made, And never fail to own, what I have said. Nearcus. It is enough, a kiss of your fair hand, Must satisfie the man, you may command; Nearcus has no soul, cannot be blest, Untill his love, with love you do invest. Enter Servants, and all go off together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Third Act. Enter The Embassador, as at Coriola, with Cleon, Erillos, and Train. Embassador. This Piazzo Cleon, is Magnificent; I have not seen any so Beautifull! Cleon. It shews the Princes Treasure, and their minds, Are alike great, who can so soon Erect So vast a City, which in every part Deserves to be as much admir'd, as this! Emba. We may walk through it, ere my Sister comes! Erillos. You may, the River side is your best view; Cleon. There is a Boat now coming to the shore; Erillos. Those who land, seem to be of Quality! Embassador. I see no Woman yet with them appear! They are very brave, and come towards us! Do any of you know who these may be? Cleon. Young Titus landed first, but as I think It is Ormasdes who now leads the Troop: Embassa. If so! I must expect some angry words, From the Offended Queen. Enter Ormasdes, and Young Titus, with Servants, who come up close to the Embassador without any respect. Emb. What means this kind of rudeness Gentlemen? Ormasdes. It speaks my business, who am hither come, To scourge that pride, you so much glory in. And with this hand that insolence chastise, Which boldly durst indeavor to defame, By base surmises, great Cleandras Name.â [He turns to Titus. âTitus, I beg as you love my Honour, If I do fall! let none come in to help! [To the Embassador. âSir, you shall have fair play, that we may see, How Insolence, and Courage do agree! [Titus makes room. Embass. I shall soon satisfie the doubt you make; [To his Followers. âStand off; he dyes that stirs to my relief; Or by a word let fall, does make me known! They fight, Ormasdes hurts and disarms him. Enter Mariana, and servants, who run in and part them. Mariana. Ormasdes hold; it is a King you wound! It is Valerianus you fight with. Ormas. My self a Prince of Greece of the same blood With our great Emperour, will justifie What I have done; and to the World declare, If any man do wrong me in disguise! I do his Titles, and himself despise. Exit Ormasdes, Titus and Train. Mari. Oh Gods! my prophetick soul, did long since Fore-see this Evil! oh let notâ King. Hold Valeriana; there are no Gods! Nor shall one Altar in my Kingdome stand, To honour those we foolishly call Gods! I will Erect new Temples unto Chance, Which guiddely, thus governs us below. Val. Take heed Sir, lest you do provoke those powers! (You now despise!) to punish your contempt! King. I will not own those Gods, those empty names, Who cannot shelter us from publick shames! Vale. The Gods be just, and you are much to blame, 'Twas not Ormasdes, who the King ore-came! It was his Virtue conquer'd your offence, Your Guilt gave Victory to Innosence. Kin. Will you, become my Judge? will you, c?demn My Life, and Honour? A fit Sacrifice To your belov'd Ormasdes fatal Sword; Fool, from this hour, I do thy blood disclaim, And will forget, I ever knew thy Name;â âErillos, let my goods be sent aboard, I will not stay a minute longer here, Then my necessity compells me to. Vale. I have prevail'd with the much injur'd Queen, To lay her anger by, and to forgive Those rash words you spoke, and have her leave To bring you to her sight again with hopes She may her inclinations change, when known! Your fury did proceed from Love alone. King. My Love is vanish'd, and my heart too full Of my revenge, to think of my return; Till I can pull Cleandra from her Throne! I hope Ormasdes will take care of you, Who plead his cause, and are to love, so true! Men. Sir, though yr wounds be slight, if you remove! So soon? we cannot answer for your life. King. I'le rather dye at Sea, then live on shore, Make hast good Cleon; lead me to my Boat. Cleon. Will you leave the Princess, in a strange land? Thus unkindly cast her off; for ever? Because her Love did argue for your good! King. And thee that dares so boldly her excuse, Who does my honour, and her own abuse. [The Princess sound. Cleon. Look Sir, she dyes! your unkindness kills her, King. She cannot do her self, and me more right, Then to dye now! but she cannot depart, While great Ormasdes Triumphs in her heart!â [She Recovers. âSee how his Name, her fainting soul Revives! Lead on, or I shall laugh to see her dye! That can raise Trophies for my infamy. Exit King and Train. Valeriana. What cruelty is this? to leave me here! Who love him better, then he loves himself; âYou'l be all ruin'd, if you stay with me! Cleon. What we have said, has ruin'd us enough, If his unruly rage, can reach so far? Mene. I think 'twere best, that you return to Court, And do Cleandras proffer'd friendship try, I have all your Brothers Jewells here, Which will defray your charges while you stay. Valeriana. Tis a plentifull provision for us; But where is young Nearcus, all this while? Cleon. He has not yet appear'd, since we Arriv'd. Enter to them Ormasdes, young Titus, Nearcus, and Servants, Ormasdes stands off. Nearcus. Madam, can you forgive, what I have done? And own the Author of so great a crime? Who saw not then a Princess in disguise, But was captiv'd by Marianas eyes! Valeriana. My Lord, I do forgive, and shall forget, So you repent! and I will serve you to, With all my power, and interest in the Queen. Nearcus. If that be all, would I had guilty been Of greater crimes, then my good natur'd sin. Young Titus. Madam, we hear your Brother is unkind, But by Cleandras favours you may find Some means to reconcile you unto him. Valeriana. I am most happy in Cleandras love. Yo. Tit. Will you permit Ormasdes in your Boat? Or shall he seek some other passage home? Maria. I could have wish'd Ormasdes less concern'd, Or that his courage had not been so great; But cannot quarrel him on this account; He was oblig'd to right Cleandras wrongs; And must in Justice be applauded for't. Ormas. Madam, I thank the Gods for my success, And now with the same breath, can humbly beg, That you'l forgive, what they so late approv'd? Valeriana. Sir, it will not become me, his Sister, âNow to congratulate your Victory, Who have just cause to mourn my Brothers Fate; From whence my own misfortunes have their date Ormas. Madam, shall we attend you to your Boat? Valeri. Let Titus order all, as he thinks fit! I am ready now for my remove. Exeunt. Titus leads off Valeriana, the rest follow. Enter Cleobulus and Chyron. Chy. The Queen is troubled, and her Guards are sent With speed, Ormasdes Quarrel to prevent: Cleob. She must secure th'Embassadors return, Lest all our Neighbour-Nations do complain, And say, we give occasion for a War; Which the Treconians claim cannot pretend, Nor the rejected Marriage, Justifie. Chyron. Valerianus has an antient claim To Zelnia, which may beget a War! If the Treconians do a quarrel seek? There wants no Title to a Prince provok'd Cleob. Ormasdes will rejoyce, to see that day! Chy. He is our Nations Darling, and deserves, Cleandras favour; but methinks, he lookes, As if his heart, were higher, then his head! Cleo. I have been lately chid for juggling looks, And dare not say, what I believe I see. Enter to them Cleandra. Old Titus, and Ladies. Queen. You tell such wonders from Coriola, That I want faith for it! how comes this Newes? Admiral. Madam, a Messenger but now Arriv'd, Saw the Combate done, and heard Nearcus say, They would attend Valeriana back Unto your Majesty; (whereas the wonder?) Princes have been in forreign Courts disguis'd! Que. But have you ever such strange humors found? A Prince where Vice, and Virtue, is so mixt! Admi. No, I have not, nor such a president! As now Ormasdes gives us to correct Such impudence, as near before was known. Queen. If I were not concern'd, I should approve. What he has done, though now I must not own? Admi. For publique thanks on his behalf, I move.â âWhy should we thus, our honest thoughts disguise? When Virtuous Actions, Virtue Justifies. Queen. Had not Ormasdes stird! by Armes I might Compell his Master to have done me right. Admi. By war, thousands of guiltless persons might Have suffer'd, for one mans over-sight. Queen. You have reason Titus, and I shall Judge Ormasdes Act, as he deserves from me; Who with my Nation, am so much oblig'd, I must approve, whatever he will own! âLet the young Princess lodgings be prepar'd, Fit for my Friend, and Sister to a King. Enter to them, Valeriana, Young Titus, Nearcus, and Servants. Queen. You are welcome Madam, and I am glad To have you on these terms; do not weep To part with, what your virtue could not keep! Valerian. I am happy, by my unhappiness, For by your favour Madam, I may find Some remedy for my afflicted mind. Queen. Be sure, what Citherea can afford, Is yours; and all Cleandra does command With me rejoyce, to see you safe return'd; âBut where is Ormasdes? I must chide him. Nearc. He is retir'd Madam, to avoid your sight. Titus. Ormasdes thinks it duty, and respect, Not to appear at Court, till you direct! Queen. Pray fetch him hither now; I hope you can Exit Titus. With me, forgive so Excellent a man! Whose passion never does his reason sway, But follows on, when virtue leads the way. Valeriana. I have no anger to Ormasdes, since Young Titus did my Brothers crime relate, I hope this letting blood, will do him good, When this affront, at home, is understood! Queen. Your Justice, and your Charity is great, And I do see no reason but you may Admit Ormasdes, in my company; I am inform'd, he has a slght hurt to! Valeriana. My furious Brother will be glad indeed! That brave Ormasdes, by his hand does bleed. This accident, if you'l be pleas'd, to call My Brother back? may reconcile us all. Queen. I never shall consent to his desires, Though I my anger, and revenge remove, In complement to you, whom I do love. Enter to them Ormasdes, and Young Titus. Ormas. Madam, if doing Justice, have displeas'd! I do repent, and now your pardon beg. Queen. Since his great insolence, and your revenge, No Age can parallel! both must submit To such a censure as the World thinks fit. Ormas. Your pardon Madam, is not all my sute, I beg your interest to obtain like grace From this sad Lady! my whole Soul is vext, To see such innocence, so much perplext. Queen. I can now secure you there Ormasdes, She does discreetly Judge, what you have done, Was, what a man of honour could not shun. âIs not this truth Valeriana? speak? [Valeriana stands surpris'd. Valeri. Yes Madam, I do think, I did say so! [She sighs, and weeps. Q. What suddain change is this? can your soft heart, Conceal a thought of ill? towards the man You have excus'd? and seem'd to smile upon! Nearcus. She does love Ormasdes, and I am lost! Aside.] [Valeriana weeps. Qu. Pray leave us, all with-draw! to the next room:â [Exeunt. âWhat have I said? that can disturb you thus? Impart your griefs, and I will share in them. Valeriana. I dare not shew 'um with an open face! Queen. And why, you cannot have a guilt so great That I cannot forgive; speak it freely. Vale. Has not my face, my guilty heart betray'd? Queen. I understand you not! Vale. âI am safe then, and may my sorrow hide. [Aside. Queen. Madam, what means this talking to your self? While I stand by neglected! is your trust So great? that you can doubt I will be just? Vale. I doubt my self great Queen, and fears not you; [Aside. She's jealous of me, and my thoughts too true! She loves Ormasdes, and most unhappy I, Am forc'd to smile on my own Tragedy; I know no way to hide my broken heart, Unless I do immediately depart!â âMadam, I beg your Pardon, and your Pass, I must begon, least I too late alass! By my distempers here, deserve your blame, And raise my memory, eternal shame Queen. You are not well sure, this distracted talk, Requires Physitians to consult; I'le send;â Vale. Oh no! there needs no more consult for this, You only can restore me unto bliss! Queen. And can you doubt, that I will not? Vale. I fear so! Queen. What I can do, be you assur'd, I will. Vale. What I desire, may be more priz'd by you, Then is the Citherean Diadem! âWill you know now? and if not grant! forgive? For I am desperate on the suddain grown, And am resolv'd to make my weakness known. Queen. Speak it aloud, or in my bosome breath, [Imbraces her. The troubles of thy soul, let not a thought Be hid, but freely shew, how much you trust My love, and you shall find me kind, and just. Vale. Do not you Madam, value Ormasdes Person? and his service above all mens? Queen. Yes, I do. Valeri. You are Just, and Worthy;âand I amâ [Valeriana faints. Queen. Help, help, some help there! Enter Ormasdes, Titus, Nearcus, and Ladies, who take up Valeriana. Nearcus. Tis love, upon my life! [Aside. Queen. Leave us again, the dangers over now; Ormas. I beg your permission to retyre. Queen. My best wishes still attend Ormasdes. Exit Ormasdes, with the rest. Valeria. What can I say, t'excuse what I have done? Qu. Speak plainly your full thoughts, &amp; I'm yr friend; But if you longer dally with my love! You will my friendship, unto anger move. Valeri. I know you have discover'd by my words, That your Esteem of him, you boldly own, Becomes the ground of my distraction; Que. You love him then! that look declares it now! And so do I, or I would ne're consent To give him unto you; if this cure grow Within my reach! Ormasdes shall be yours. Valeri. Is not your Majesty ingag'd to him? Queen. Indeed, I am not so in love with him, But I can second your desires; and will With all my power endeavor to perswade Ormasdes that he meet with open armes, So great a blessing by the Gods design'd; Though I must part with what I value most, Your passion, never shall by me be crost. Valeri. Madam, your kindness to me flows so fast, That I am now in danger to be lost, By my abundant joy for this success You give, of unexpected happiness. Que. Remove these sullen clouds from thy fair Eyes, And be thy self again, for I will shew Ormasdes suddainly how great a bliss, The Heav'ns prepare to Crown his Virtue with. Valer. The Gods reward you with your highest wish! That you may never want what you desire, My spirits fail so fast! I must retire. [Exit. Her Maids lead her off, leaning on them, and shewing much weakness. Queen. Do so; what's this, I have so rashly done! Thrown off Ormasdes I depend on! Must I perswade him quit that Interest here, Which for my sake, he purchased so deare! âHow ill shall I repay his service past? If I advise, this banishment at last; What a rash promise, has my pitty made? By thus proposing my improper Ay'd! Though by the secret charms of sympathy, Her passion won my reason to comply, I must on this imployment Titus use, My Honour will my active part excuse. âBut if his Arguments should not prevail? And by my nicety, the business fail? âIf she should perish so? and I repent To late, that ill! which I may yet prevent; âI must about it then, and loose no time, Lest my nice complements do prove a crime! âMy faith is past, and I will now proceed, Though brave Ormasdes do condemn the Deed. Exit with Train. Enter Nearcus, with Valeriana, in her Chamber, her Ladies stand off, but go not out. Nea. Madam, my desperate State, and high transport, You may complain of, though not blame me for't; Your eyes, like bright misguiding fires, betray My wandring soul, and make me lose my way. Tis now too late, to see that I am lost, Led by those guides, to this obdurate coast, Where neither Rocks appear, nor crossing Tides; Yet this expected safety, ruine hides! âBut I must claim you by a solemn vow, Made in the sight of Heav'n; and am come now, To prove my Birth, which you will not deny, Is with your own, of equall Quality; These are such Arguments for your consent, I cannot think, you dare your vowes repent. Vale. It cannot well be thought, and much less said, That I repent a promise, never made; How could such hasty words, strict vowes appear? Which my surprise, then made me speak in fear! When you to seize me, stretch'd those Lions paws, And threatn'd 'gainst all Hospitable Laws! Worse then Death to me; what might I not do? To get from such a Monstrous Beast as you! Near. Did my humility such danger threat? Or my submission, with such horror treat! Were it even so, as you your self have said! I might my own conditions, then have made. Vale. Did you not all my Servants first exclude? And me into a loneness so delude, As that no rescue could be had! to free Me from your Trayterous Captivity. When you with humble looks, strong fetters laid, And words let fall, which made my soul afraid; And caus'd me use some little Art, to gain Your trust, that I my freedom might obtain. Near. Tis true indeed, and you reproach me well, Or else you might another story tell! For I confess, I did too much! to prove The humble passion of a gentle Love; And much too little, now to justifie My high affections, or my fact denie. Had I with vigour my first step persu'd, You might have wish'd my vows, with yours renew'd. Vale. You talk, as now, I at your mercy were; As if you still might threat; and I must fear! But I shall make you know your self, and me, If you proceed not with more modesty! And shall soon let Cleandra understand, How well you Treated me! on her command. Near. Though I do shake, and tremble at your frown, Cleandras anger, cannot bow me down. For if my suffering no compassion move, Nor your past vowes, make you regard my Love! You shall then see, how little I esteem This Life, you will not with a smile redeem! Valeriana. I am not thus ingratefull as you say, So I may be secur'd another way; âI did not threat, till you aspers'd my Name, By this false promise, you unjustly claim. For though your Birth flow from a Noble Spring, Tis something less, then Daughter to a King. And more, I must the secret now impart, That brave Ormasdes long since, had my heart. Near. Madam, I have no Plea beyond my Love, If that, do of too mean a value prove! Think how your honour stands ingag'd by vow, And that my all depends upon it now! Yet here I do before the Gods profess, To quit my Title, if my birth be less! Vale. From Nearcus, the Gods will me protect, Who boldly must a subjects claim, reject. Near. Which I am not; but a Prince Nobly born, As is Cleandra! though you now do scorn The Man, who lay'd his greatness at your feet, Without a thought, of Royalty to meet! Your Virtue, and your Beauty did engage My heart to Love; and did create that rage, You now so much condemn; and makes me shame I did no more, who was so much to blame! Vale. You do amaze me! knows Cleandra this? Near. She yet does not, but must do, when I plead My Title to Valerianas Bed. For Madam, you can onely now be mine, Made so by humane Lawes, and by Divine. Vale. What ere you are! I do much scorn to think Of being compell'd and will strong poyson drink, Rather then be by such a trick betray'd, Or of your scandalous reports, afraid; Your first attempt was base; and now as vain Your hopes are; you are a Prince! I do disdain To have a thought for him, who poorly can, Demand, what's given to another man. I must this Injury at last reveal, And to the Queen, for Justice now appeal. Near. I am content, then let Cleandra Judge, Vale. I'le hear no more. [Exit with Ladies. Near. What a strange heat I feel, that alwayes burn, Yet do not wast, cannot to Ashes turn! But like a fire-flaming Statue stand, To warn the World, not to approach this Land; Ye Gods! how cruel is your doom? that she Melts not; but should an Icie Mountain be, Of power to kindle such tormenting fires, Where her own frozen heart has no desires. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fourth Act. Enter Cleandra, with Ormasdes, the Lords, and Ladies stand off. Queen. I shall allow your Argument for War, If the Treconian do provoke so far! But how shall I, Valeriana free? From her fierce Brothers great barbaritie; And how Estate her in her Mothers Land! If her mad Brother, should that right withstand! Though she do now desire but what's her own, If he should dye; She must Ascend that Throne. Ormas. I have heard so, and that, by my rash Act, She suffers, which makes me repent the Fact! Queen. Her virtues, do her beauty far excell, And in my judgement, have no parallel; What is your thought? will not the man be blest? Whom Cods with such felicities invest! Ormas. I doubt not Madam, her perfections may In hearts of Men; above her Scepter sway. Queen. She has won me, to a concern so high, As if my own, were the same Desteny With hers; my thoughts do labor where to treat A Marriage with some Prince, worthy so great A Queen; can you Ormasdes find me one To recommend? will Greece afford us none? Ormas. Madam, if Citherea can produce None fit! for Greece, there will need no excuse;â Queen. I think so too, unlesse Ormasdes will Himself, thus my prophetick soul fulfill! That does such glories, and such joyes foresee, As may indure unto Eternitie. Ormas. Me Madam, does your Majesty think me A man worthy of so great Felicitie? Alas I am too old, now to begin To Love! you may as soon learn me to spin; âMy Sword, and Armor, into Needles turn, As teach my Age in Youthful flames to burn. Queen. Tis you Ormasdes, are the man so blest, Her love to you, she has to me confest; And me in honour has ingag'd to try, If I can now perswade you to comply. Ormas. Madam, I hope you do not thus abuse Your servant, cause my nature does refuse, Such correspondence with your Sex, as might Ingage a braver Man; Oh do not fight Against my weakness! that must now confess, I never unto Lady made Address; And onely chose this solitary place, That I might here some quiet thoughts imbrace. âSure Madam, you mistake; how can it be? That she should covet such Antipothy! âCan the good Gods to her be so unkind? To let such excellence, become so blind? Qu. Think you her self knows? what her self desires? Or that she has no sence, of those quick fires, That do consume her! can you doubt such Love? Which through dispair, did then so mortal prove! That but to name Ormasdes, she did Dye, Till you appear'd, to change that destiny; âAnd when you all retir'd, she did confess, Her life depended on her good success; Your Glorious Acts had raised so loud a Fame, That she was first in Love with your great Name! Which brought her hither, with a full intent, To Judge, and Justifie, that Argument. Ormas. Madam, I must believe what you avow, And do so far your Argument allow, That it has rais'd in me, a greater war, Then I was ever in; and am so far From slighting this affair, that I descry, My certain Ruine, by this Victory. The Gods cannot afford lesse punishment, If I refuse to hear! and if consent! I'm lost, to all my joyes on Earth; for Fate Has not in store, nor can the Gods Create An evill, I fear more, then to deny, What you command; though a sad Desteny; âCan nothing less then my destruction? save This Excellence? from an untimely Grave! Queen. If I could see this danger you foretell? Ormasdes harms, should make no other well! Though Valeriana do my pitty move, Ormasdes friendship, is before her Love In my esteem; but if this match unite Your hearts? it will our Children then invite, To imitate our friendship, and so tye Fast knots, for everlasting Ametie. Ormas. My mind can move my body any way, But my hard heart, will not my will obey; My utmost power, my soul to mourn shall teach, Cause my Affection, is beyond my reach! Queen. If you oppose not, but your ear will lend, I doubt not, but the Gods your heart will bend This way, and your good nature in short time, Will make you wish for, what you judge my crime. Ormas. Although I cannot, wish, and must not chuse, I would not Madam, willingly refuse What you advise; but boldly meet my Fate, That no one thought, may a vain fear Create, Lest you should judge my slackness, for neglect, Because I graspe not, what I cann't affect. Queen. Can you such pleasure tak, in this disguise? Be thus retir'd? and all that's good despise, When offer'd! do you fear? or scorn to meet This Excellence, now fallen at your feet! âIs your great heart Ormasdes, onely made For dangerous attempts? shall it be said? This Parragon of all our Sex! now dyes, Because Ormasdes, does her Love despise! Ormas. No Madam, I do suffer more, then she Does for her self! hers, is my miserie; I dare not virtue, with vain hopes abuse, I cannot love; and therefore do refuse To dally with so bright a Saint, whose Shrine, Compells all hearts to bow before't, but mine; I am not capable of Love; not blest That way! my heart's with other flames possest. Queen. All flames you feel, would vanish, did you see Valeriana in such misery As she endure! now fetching her last breath, Enquiring your health, neglecting her own death. Thus my compassion has her sorrows learn'd, I weep her tears, while you stand unconcern'd! Ormas. Madam, your passion does my pitty move, Though my dull heart cannot consent to Love; My resolution is now fixt; I'le try My self to vanquish, or her Martyr Dye! âI swear, I did not hear that she was ill, And now it does my soul with horrour fill, For her concern; no danger is so great, But I will rather dye in't, then retreat. Queen. Tis bravely said, but dare you try the effect, Of one short visit? after such neglect! Ormas. Thus provok'd! if your Majesty stands by! I will not such a visit now deny. Queen. You speak, and look, as if you meant to fright, Much rather, then revive her by your sight! Ormas. Madam, to Complement, I have no skill, Nor can be pleas'd, if lov'd against my will! Yet sensible, and civil, I can be, Though it do prove unfortunate, to me. Queen. When shall I bring this comfort? to revive Her fainting soul; if she be still alive. Ormas. Is she really so weak; so soon grown Thus ill? I have no skill, in this unknown Mystery of love! but will boldly try, What I can do, for her recovery. Queen. High passions do weak bodies sooner bring To the Graves mouth, then any other thing; Her despairs, are of a much longer date, Though suddain sickness do break out thus late; âWhen I your humour, did at first reherse, And shew'd, how your whole life had been averse To Love; she sigh'd, and presently grew pale, Despair that minute, made her spirits fail; And so transported by her fancy, fell As if my doubts, had rung her passing bell. Orm. Though I cannot speak, nor do yet know how To look; I'm ready to attend you now! Queen. I fear, so suddain, and so great a joy! As your approach; may equally destroy! Let me her heart prepare, that by degrees, She may but hope retain, before she sees The comfort, that your visit brings; and then Ormasdes may ere long, prove best of Men. Ormas. Madam, I do my self to you submit, Pray order me in all, as you think fit. Queen. You shall then stand unseen, while I do tell This welcome story, which will make her well. And then by what you'l see you may observe, How my true friendship will from both deserve! Who have no wish beyond Ormasdes good, When time shall make me rightly understand. Ormas. Madam, I have now no more to say, But that I will your Majesty obey. Queen. You shall not stir Ormasdes till I send. Exit Queen and Train. Enter to him Nearcus. Ormas. Did you not meet Cleandra going out? Near. Yes, but I have business of importance, Pray let us withdraw, and be more private. Ormas. Come this way then:â They go out, and Re-enter. Ormas. Why have you drawn me to this inner room? Is the secret, of so piercing quality? That fewer walls then these, cannot contain't! Near. It is my Lord of a high nature grown, I must impart it to your self alone; âYou and I, must kill one another now; Orma. May not I live? though you are pleas'd to die? Near. No Sir, since tis decreed that I must die! I am resolv'd to have your Company. âThere's a sword, the same wt h mine, defend you. Ormasdes. Hold a while:â âMay not I know the cause of this hatred? Near. I have no hatred, yet endeavor, must That we together may revert to dust. Though you by chance have rob'd me of my right âI'de not out-live Ormasdes, if I might! Or. From wh?ce dos this strange kindnes to me grow? Say, for I will not fight, untill I know! Near. This then, will teach you to defend your self: Runs at him; he put his Sword by, and holds him. Ormas. I shall call my Servants, unless you now show The cause of this distracted fury? Near. I will:â [Lets him go âValeriana's my Quarrel; She throws neglects on me, and dotes on you. Ormas. You are mistaken sure, and much abus'd! It is not possible!âShe dotes on me! Who never Courted Lady in my life! Near. By all that's good, she told me so her self. Ormas. This must be some design, beyond my reach! But if true? from whence does my guilt arise? Who never heard of your pretence, till now! Nor have a serious thought for hers, to me; If such a folly, do her heart possess; Am I to answer for her guiltiness? Near. I do accuse you, of no guilt at all; But joy to think, if by my hand you fall; It will Create in her such miserie, As will adorn my death with Victorie. Ormas. If such revenge, and malice you intend? Where is the Love, that you so much pretend? Near. We'l talk of that, as our two souls expire; She flatter'd me with hopes, that blew my fire, She threw out vowes to marry me, and now In hope of you, disowns that holy vow. Ormas. Made vows to marry you! and yet love me! Pray shew me how, this story does agree? I swear, I never had a thought of Love To Lady in my life; and will now quit The intrest you pretend, rather then fightâ For such imaginary Dreams, as this. Nearcus. You must Fight. Nearcus offers at him, he rings a Bell: Enter Servants. Ormas. No; disarm him,âso, now leave us alone,â [Exeunt. âNearcus, I have lov'd you, and shall still, If you'l permit!âwhat does this story mean? Near. By HeaâValeriana did ingage To marry me; if my birth equal'd hers! But now repents, in hope to marry you. Ormas. This story grows stranger, and stranger still Does your birth equal hers? on which you ground Your Title, and on which her vow was made. Near. It does Ormasdes, and did hers exceed, When I first urg'd that sacred vow she made; She but a Subject, unto me appear'd. Ormas. And are you other now? Near. Yes, have you not heard that Prince Orontes, Brother to our late King, had a young Son Call'd Leonatus, who by sad mishap, Fencing with the Prince, hurt him in the Eye, Of which hurt he dyed; and the King, inrag'd, Made vowes to Sacrifice the Murtherer; As if the mischief, purposely were done! In order to his own Succession;â â(After Cleandra;) who was then married To a young Prince in Greece, and setl'd there. Orm. I'ave often heard the Queen, with sighs lament Her Brothers loss, by that sad accident: And say, she pittied Leonatus death, As innocent! for that unhappy youth, She heard, was drown'd, endeavouring to escape Her Fathers Vengeance, he unjustly vow'd. Near. She was mis-inform'd my Lord, he yet lives; 'Twas by this fatall hand, her brother fell; And I accurs'd, that have thus long surviv'd! To fall a mis-becoming Sacrifice, To Love; by a disdainful Ladies Eyes. After so long concealment, and so safe! By Old Nearcus, put in this disguise, Bred as his Son; but now, I Life despise; And call to have that Justice on me done, Which I have us'd much industry to shun. Ormas. You tell me wonders, of a different kind, Of which I shall enquire; and if I find Valeriana stands ingag'd to you? And all this story of your self, prove True! I will my best endeavors soon imploy, This gross mistake of me, to rectifie. Near. If my address, do find no good success! The business of my life, shall be to dye, And whether by your hand, or by command From our great Queen? it is the same to me, The Princess must my Life, or Death decree. Ormas. I shall conceal your Name, untill I see, I may reveal it, with securitie; And in few hours, if my desires succeed! You shall from all your doubts, and fears be freed. Near. You will oblige me ever, if you do! [Exit Nearcus. Ormas. My hour is come, to wait upon the Queen, Unto Valeriana, where this Newes, I hope will bring me off, from the first Rock:â âBy Valeriana to be thus lov'd! And by Cleandra, for another woo'd! And by Nearcus kill'd, I know not why! To me is a new kind of Misterie. [Exit. Enter Valeriana, brought in very weak, lying in a Couch, with Physitians, and Servants; She speaks very faintly. Valeri. Is not the Queen return'd to Court yet? Lady. No Madam. Valeri. I wish she were; my heart dessolves so fast! That I do find, I shall few minutes last. [She faints. Doct. Your fancy, does your weakness much increase, This passion, is the worst of your disease. Enter Queen, and Ormasdes, she sets him to stand unseen. Doctor. Oh Madam! you are much wish'd for here; Queen. Let all withdraw, I must be private now, Onely do you Ormasdes stand unseen;â âHow is it with my friend? Vale. I'm glad that you are come to close my Eyes, My spirits wast so fast, that I must dye! Queen. I hope not yet Valeriana. Vale. Alass Madam, I had not liv'd till now, But for the joy my broken heart conceives In hopes to hear Ormasdes is grown well. Before I leave this world. Queen. Twas the distemper of an Ague fit, And he is now so far from being sick, That he without, begs leave to visit you. Vale. Me, did you say? to visit me Madam! Will Ormasdes visit me? is it so? Queen. Yes, He's without, and does by me desire You will admit him;âWhy are you silent? Now my endeavours prosper to your wish! Vale. Does wise Cleandra think it will be fit? That I in such a passion leave this World! As I shall do, if I see Ormasdes!â âI shame to think that he should see me dye, Yet cannot chuse, but wish it heartily! Queen. Shall I call him in then? why do you doubt? Vale. Oh Madam, I dare not see him, must not! You have said something, to bring him hither! Makes me fear to see him; it must not be! Que. Pray see him, and let this great crime, be mine; His presence, may your troubl'd heart revive. Vale. He cannot Madam, for tis now too late! I do feel here, the heavy hand of Death Is crushing me to Ayre. She faints in the Queens Armes. Queen. Ormasdes your help! she dies, she dies! He draws, and proffers to kill himself. Ormas. By all our Gods, I will dye with her then! Queen. She lives again! Ormasdes your help now;â He flings away his Sword, and helps. âSo let her head lye a little from us. He kneels, and holds her hand. Ormas. For Heav'n sake Madam, tell what I must say? Or what now must do? is she not dead still? Queen. Does not her hand inform you, that she lives? Is it not warm? Ormas. Oh yes! tis warm, but I, who never dar'd Thus boldly touch a Ladies hand till now; Understand not how to use it, as I ought! [He Kisses her hand. Que. There needs no other kindness, then you shew, âHow is it now Valeriana? Vale. Well Madam to well, I fear, to last so: I dare not look that way, because I blush To think how I have scandaliz'd my Sex! And how Ormasdes now is justified! In his contempt of Women, for my sake! I have no power to take away my hand, Yet dare not own, to leave it with him longer. Ormas. Oh why? what has Ormasdes ever done? Justly to merrit this dissertion? Vale. Pray Madam, say something in my behalf; Either to hide, or to excuse my shame. Queen. Turn this way then, and let your Eyes excuse That guilt, which will Ormasdes disabuse. [They turn her.] Ormas. She looks desperately ill! Queen. Tis only weakness, and no danger in't; Pray call her Servants, and let us retire. Ormas. Retire! you have engag'd me now so far, That I must see the Battle won, or lost! Before I can consent, to a Retreat. Queen. Tis late, and she must sleep. Ormas. Why Madam, so she may, though I be by! I'le sit as silent, as the God of sleep, And here attend, while her tir'd servants rest. Queen. You will not watch all night Ormasdes? Ormas. Oh but I will Madam; watch night, by night, Till she recover! This is my fixt Post, Appointed by the Gods; not your command, Nor any force, has power to take me hence; While this good sword will hold for my defence. [Takes up his Sword. Queen. Why so fierce, and violent Ormasdes? I am much joy'd to see you thus concern'd! And on this quarrel, am not like to fight With such a man at Armes, by candle light! Or. For Heav'n sake Madam, pardon my rash words, And disrespect unto your Majesty; For I do scarce know what I say, or do; I am become a stranger to my self, So suddainly transform'd, that I would hide Me from your sight, if I durst stir from hence! Queen. I will forgive, so you'l let me direct Your future actions, I'le your Love protect! Ormas. If you'l command?âI gladly will obey. Queen. You must submit, to what she does appoint. Ormas. Most willingly. Valeriana, sighs aloud, and weeps. Qu. Does our discourse, these sighs, &amp; tears produce? Vale. You have said nothing that will need excuse. These tears flow from joy, and gratitude, To you great Queen, who by this act, include More pious pitty, then past stories tell;â To make Ormasdes counterfeit so well! âThis thought raisd those unruly sighs you heard. And Madam, now it makes my soul affraid, To see so great a courage thus submit, To flatter me, because you think it fit; âAt your command, to put on this disguise, In kindness unto one, he does despise. Queen. Do you then think his kindness counterfeit? Can his great soul consent, to such deceit? Vale. I can yet find no argument, for ground, To change so great contempt, as I have found, Into so high esteem! as he does now, By your advice, in charity allow; That my last minutes, may some pleasure have, He yields to send me smiling to my grave. Queen. You cannot judge so ill, of him you love; Nor can so brave a man, so worthless prove! Vale. I do confess, I should be glad to find All real that I see; and his great mind The same brave Character he had, maintain Through his whole life; and not that glory stain But if't be real, this comes now too late, His kindness cannot change the course of Fate! Queen. Think not of Death, for if you will endure The Tryall? I will undertake the cure; I see your sufferings do compassion move, Which in most genrous hearts, does turn to Love. Ormas. Madam, I know not what, you do call love, Nor how in that fantastick Sphear to move! I cannot talk the language Lovers use, When they design fair Ladies to abuse; Nor can I yet, by this experience guess, If Love, or a distraction, does possess My heart? give me but leave to watch this night, That while you sleep, I may my heart invite, To tell me what it ails! if it be Love? What all the World allows! I shall approve: And then, I'le rather dye, then e're forsake What I avow, or what I undertake. Q. Pray Madam, give him leave to watch this night, Some serious thoughts may set his fancy right. He has lyen often on the frozen ground, On less occasion, and more danger found. Vale. I shall not rest then, though you think it fit, I shall condemn my self, if I submit. Queen. Tis somewhat more then custome does allow, I must confess; but how to help it now, Who knows? you see he is resolv'd to beat Us all, if we but mention his Retreat. Ormas. Pray let not this my first sute be deny'd, But give me leave to sit on yonder side, As silent as sleep self; my body shall Be fixt, as is that figure on the wall. Queen. Let him Valeriana, pray consent, 'Twill prove his honor, or his punishment! Ormas. Who can have more care? who so fit as I To watch? who am resolv'd with her to Dye. âGood rest unto your Majesty. He leads off the Queen. Queen. He'l turn me out, if I refuse to go! âBut why Ormasdes do you tremble so? Ormas. This shaking fit may to a Feavor turn, And I, e're day, in Loves bright flames may burn. [Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fifth Act. Valeriana is discover'd asleep on a Couch, with Doctors, and Ladies all asleep about her Ormasdes rises from the ground, at the Couch side. Ormasdes. All eyes are shut, all hearts can rest, but mine, I've somthing here, that will not let me sleep: âTis Love, I am bewitch'd, or it is Love! That thus disturbs my body, and distracts My mind; no other passion works like this! Well then, if it be Love! where's the wonder? The wisest, bravest, and the greatest men, Have been in Love as much, or more then I; âBut why then was I, thus long without it? Why did not bright Cleandras beauty burn? Why was not this fire kindl'd untill now? How comes Valeriana by this power? To wound me deeper, then Cleandra did! My Kind, Loving Heart, how comes this to pass? Valeriana sighs, and groans aloud. Ormas. Ha! Her spirit by that sigh informs me, That doubl'd groan, struck through my wavring soul, Oh thou Divinest power! what ere thou art! I do submit, Valerianas groans Are all sufficient arguments for Love! It seems, my stony heart, was proof against All charms, but deep fetch'd sighs, &amp; dying grons; By which, tis now made supple, and so soft, That it is ready to take any form; That sick Valeriana shall direct;â âGreat God of Love, forgive my past neglects, And now restore this Lady to her health, Then I with Insense will thy Altars load, Thy Temple with those Trophies, now adorn, Which my whole life prepar'd, for Mars and Jove. Since they allow me to submit to Love! Valeriana wakes, and calls. Vale. Drusilla. Ormas. Madam, your Servants do all sleep, but I. Vale. I would not have wak'd you, Ormasdes. Ormas. You have not Madam, I have not slept yet; Pray let your Servant know what tis you want! Vale. I want assurance of a thing I doubt. Ormas. Can I give you that assurance? Vale. Yes. Ormas. And will you not lay that command on me? Vale. Do they all sleep? Ormas. They do. Vale. Ormasdes I would know, what I do fear, You are pre-ingag'd never to tell me; Ormas. By your fair self, I swear, I'm not ingag'd In any kind, but may, and will impart, What ever in my knowledge, you inquire. Vale. My first doubts does still remain, that the Queen Upon assurance of my suddain death, Has won you, thus to flatter my last hours, Like glittering Sun-shine upon dying Flowers. Ormas. Madam, by all thats holy, she has not: What shall I say? what do? to gain your faith? Vale. You have done it now; I am satisfied. And do believe all's truth, Ormasdes speaks, But I do fear this truth appears too late. Orm. Why Madam? have you made vows against me? Will no repentance? nor no pennance serve, To wash away my Sins against your Sex Will you, that Universal quarrel wed? And bring distruction, on your Servants head? Vale. Vows Ormasdes, and those against you made! Oh do not take away the Joy you gave, By such a thought; I never wish'd, nor pray'd, For blessing upon Earth, beyond your Love, Which you in charity, so amply shew, That I do doubt I dream, what I injoy. Ormas. Madam, you do now misjudge my passion, To call that charity, which may be love For ought I know; this so late acquaintance With my new heart is short, and my transports So great, it must be madness, if not love: For, give me leave to swear, that I will know No other Joys then yours, nor thoughts admit, But with design to serve, and honour you. Vale. I do now wish the Gods my life would spare, And make me worthy of Ormasdes care. Ormas. Madam, you speak a Language of respect To me, who merrit nothing but neglect; Your favours flow so fast, they over-whelm My heart with joys, and raise my soul so high, It turns amazement into extacy. Vale. I should not talk thus, if I did not see't; Tis harder for you now to hide; then shew't: I do not fear your passion, will go less, But doubt by death to lose, what I possess. Ormas. You cannot dye Madam, I have no fear To find so great a curse, from Heav'n sent, I onely doubt I sleep! and fear to wake Least this abundant bliss should vanquish quite, And so involve me in Eternal Night, May I presume to beg a favour yet? Which will my fancy fix, and so confirm My doubtfull soul tis real, and no dream. Vale. You may. Ormas. I beg that Ring you wear; but if of price Too great for me? pardon my Avarice. Vale. Tis a trifle, ask something of more worth. Ormas. Sure nothing can of greater value be If you repent, what you now promis'd me. Vale. You ask, what is not in my power to give! My dying Mother with this Ring bequeath'd Her curse, if ever I did part with it! But to the man I meant to make my Lord. Ormas. Tis a charm not to be dissolv'd by me; Who dare not touch it, on the terms, you name; I was ambitious to wear it Madam But onely as your servant, not your Lord. Vale. It never can be had, on easier termes; Ormasdes you must have this, and me together, Alive or dead, you must have both, or neither. Ormas. All my Limbs do tremble, at what I hear, I dare not understand the words you speak, Least my mistakes do give you an offence, Beyond a pardon, for such impudence. Vale. You do not mistake me, nor can you err! If you'l avow, this kindness that you shew. Ormas. By all our Gods, I think my flame is Love, I know no other name for what I feel, But if you doubt? propose a way to try, And as it proves, declare my destiny. Vale. I will consider on some way to try, But must submit unto this drowsinesse, For a minutes time, twill take me from you! Pray Sir, command the musick now to play. [He steps to the Door then.] [Musick playes awhile.] Ormas. She has talk'd her self into a Repose, Now I will try to get alittle Rest. That my tir'd fancy, may at last be fixt. Valeriana Counterfeits to sleep, Ormasdes lyes on the ground by her Couch, and while he sleeps, she puts the Ring on his finger; then the Musick ends. Vale. Soâwhen he calls to mind, what I have said; He can expect no more, then I now give; âGreat goddess of pure hearts, protect my fame, And this rash act, forgive; which frights me now; To such repentance, with such suddain pain, I am resolv'd to take it off again,â She offers to take it off, and cannot. âHis hand is so fast clos'd, I cannot do't; And to wake him in the attempt, is worse; Such boldness may a double censure get; I blush to think how rashly I begun, And now repent the folly I have done:â âHis hand opens:â And now tis mine again, Oh blest accident! She takes off the Ring, Musick playes; she sleeps in earnest, while the Musick is. Enter the Queen, and Train. Queen. Wake them not; has Ormasdes walk'd to night? From that corner, hither, in his sleep? Did any of you hear them talk ith'night? Doctor. Not I Madam. First Lady. Nor I. Second Lady. I heard none stir Madam. Ormasdes wakes and stirs up. Ormas. The Queen; is it so late? Queen. You have had a hard Lodging my Lord. Ormas. I have had the happiest night Madam; And am Richer far then both the Indies;â Ormasdes starts, and looks distractedly for something lost. âHa! I am undone, undone for ever! Qu. What look you for my Lord? what have you lost? Ormas. I had it now, just now, on this finger! I look for Treasure Madam, worth the World; [He Searches. â'Twas no dream, it must be here abouts! âI beg your pardon Madam, for this search, Which does concern my life, and honour too. Queen. This is the strangest passion, I ere saw, Has your great loss, no name to know it by? Ormas. Yes, I have lost Valerianas Ring. Queen. You did but dream, see, tis on her finger: Ormas. How! tis so indeed, do I not dream now? Or do the Gods us men with shadows mock? When we do seek such great felicities, As they allow us not to have below! âWhat a strange height of bliss? am I fall'n from? Q. Has this one night, such mutual friendship gain'd? That the prophetick Ring, could be obtain'd! Ormas. I know not what to say, nor what to think! I know not when I sleep, or when I wake! Yet must believe that Ring, was mine this night; And I have lost that Treasure Childishly: Some kind friend strike me hard, that I may feel I now am waking; your pardon Madam For my disaster makes me almost mad. [Valeriana wakes. Queen. How have you slept Valeriana? Vale. Very well Madam, for one so weak! Ormas. Did you not wake about mid-night Madam? Vale. Not that I remember. Ormas. Was ever man so much abus'd in's sleep? Vale. Ormasdes, what means your disorder'd looks? Queen. He finds his waking fancies are much less Delightfull, then his sleeping happiness. Orm. I dream't Madam, that Ring you prize so much, Was this night, by you, put on my finger; When a thousand, thousand joyes fell on me, Which now waking, I have no name for. Vale. My Ring Ormasdes! and on your finger! And by me put on! twas a dream indeed! I hope, you do not waking, think it fit, That I, should waking do so bold an act. Ormas. Madam, it does not become me to say I wish, what you do not allow; nor dare I tell so great a lye, as to deny The joy I dream'd of when I thought I saw, And did believe I felt, it once was mine. Vale. Tis far from my serious thoughts Ormasdes, After such high passion, as I have shew'd, Now to raise any discontent in you, But do not lessen your esteem of me, By the acquisition of such favours, As you your self in others would condemn! Have we not both, at first sight, done enough? To justifie, what we professe; I fear Too much on my part, did not Cleandra Own all that she has done, on my behalf. Ormas. I submit, and will wish, and think, and do What the wise Queen, and you advise me to. Queen. Ormasdes has not lost his time I see, Nor my design for your recovery Fall'n short! the gods in their good time will bring You to give, and him to accept the Ring. May your new friendship never know decay, But freely both command, and both obey: âI must now leave you for an hour, or two. Ormasdes leads the Queen to the Door, and returns. Ormas. Madam, is this a fit time to enquire Nearcus Story? may I now desire You, to unriddle the bold claim, he makes? Vale. You shall hereafter have it all at large, Only know now, he us'd a violence, In shew, with such unparallel'd deceits! Such insolent demands, so cunning couch'd! His threats, with humble looks, so plain disguis'd; That at first sight, I found, I was surpriz'd; Then, to avoid his purpose, I was forc'd, To use such doubtfull word; to bring me off, His madness did interpret his own way; While I was safe, by what I wisely said, To farther my escape, when so afraid! Thus was Cleandras trust, and mine abus'd; A baser treachery, was never us'd. Ormas. You have inform'd me fully of his fact. I suddainly will find Nearcus out, And hurle such vengeance, on his curs'd head, [Aside. That all the World shall say, tis well he's dead. [They carry off Valeriana.] [Exeunt omnes. [Enter Nearcus.] Near. Tis strange, I hear not of Ormasdes yet! If he oblige me really! I'm his, If not! I shall resume my first resolves, This his delay, begets more jealousies Then my impatient burning heart, can bear.â [Enter Ormasdes.] Nea. âNow Sir, how have I prosper'd in your hands? Ormasdes. Ormasdes. As you deserve. Nearcus. How is that? Ormas. With much scorn rejected. Near. Is that my merrit, in your opinion? Ormas. In mine, as in Cleandras, and in all! Who have heard the ground of your false claim, Which the fair Princess, and her Servants tell; âA Treachery so base, an act so foul! That all do think Nearcus has no soul. Near. This you dare justifie? Ormas. I had not dar'd to tell it else! me thinks My looks might shew, my business was to find You out, and now to let you know, I must Defend the Princess, in a cause so just. âBefore I knew Valerianas heart, Or was at all acquainted with my own; I Judg'd your cause, against her innocence. But now inform'd the right from all, I find No argument, in Justice to compell, Such a forc'd promise to Nearcus made, Should now to Leonatus be perform'd. Your juggling Arts, and your disguised Name, With your unworthy force, ore-throws your claim Near. You are become a subtle Orator, Since you convers'd with Ladies; but I shall Your great Eloquence, with this steele convince; I am not to be frighted by big words, We now must try the temper of our swords. Ormas. We must indeed, though I lament, my hand Should harm a man, unto the Queen aly'd. Ne. Shall that scruple, &amp; this good sword once more Teach you to call for help? as heretofore! Ormas. I may change your opinion, with my own. Near. Come then. They Fight, Ormasdes runs him through, Disarmes him. Ormas. Get Surgeons for Nearcus presently; My hurt is slight. [Exit Ormasdes. Enter Surgeons, or Servants, who carry off Nearcus. Enter the Queen, in Valerianas Chamber, with her, and attended by Old Titus, Old Nearcus, Lords and Ladies, a full Train. Queen. Tis by your good nature Valeriana, That this mans evil spirit threatens us, Had you reveal'd Nearcus treachery! His punishment had suted with his crime. Vale. Madam, I do confess my lenity. May have imbolden'd him to higher ills, Which my just complaint, might have prevented; But then, how hard a censure should I gain? By ruining so Eminent a man. Who from his principles of honour fell, Through love to me; though I c?temn'd his hopes, His passion made me pitty his distress, So far, as his first errour to forgive, In hope he might in better order live. Queen. You argue well, and ought to justifie Your gentle disposition, to forgive. Mercy, does a young Princess, much adorn, But I am bound to vindicate my self, My Nation suffers if I be not just, To punish crimes like this! I break my trust; He is the first, that ever dar'd asperse The Citherean Name, by such a fact, As no past Chronicle, can parallel! I shake to think, how great your danger was! And how much greater might have been my shame To trust a man, who values not his fame. Vale. Let not his faults your anger higher raise, The punishment he feels, by ill success, Is a just doom, for his unworthiness. Queen. His sentence must, to after times appear, Least my story be blemish'd with a thought, That I, did wink at such a crime as this! My people will exclaim, the Gods will frown, If such a wickedness unpunisht pass! He must dye Valeriana, his house Be burnt, the ashes scatter'd in the Ayre, With prayers t'appease our Citherian Gods, We cannot offer a less Sacrifice. Vale. For my sake, let his doom, be banishment. If I have any favour in your Eyes? Make not me guilty by that Sacrifice. [She kneeles Queen. Rise Madam, you shall govern as you please. Enter to them Ormasdes, and Young Titus. Queen. Ormasdes, are you hurt, by that vil'd man? Ormas. It is too little, to be call'd a wound! I come now, to beg Nearcus pardon; Twas I that did inforce him to this fight. Vale. And I, most wrong'd, who freely do forgive; Queen. The wrong was done to me Valeriana, I put you in his power, my trust, he broke; My honour, for your safety, was ingag'd! Our Nation suffers by his Villany; The Citherean honour calls for Justice, Against so barbarous a breach of Faith; Nor was it you provok'd, but were compell'd By him to fight, for innocence aspers'd! Ormas. Madam, though I shall never justifie Nearcus actions; his misfortune may Admit excuse; Because humane nature Is subject to passions, which the best men Can never mannage, as they ought! how then; May Valeriana's beauty guilty be? That did excite Nearcus love; and led Him into this distraction, past his power! To manage his own heart, (as we think best;) If so! tis she has turn'd him to a Beast; But when your Majesty shall call to mind, The gallant service by this Mad-man done; You will then pitty his Distraction. Enter to them Nearcus, brought in a Chair. Queen. What means this boldness? Near. Madam, I come not to beg your pardon, But to justifie my actions, and my self; Against Ormasdes, who does now with-hold Valeriana, my betroathed Wife, Confirm'd by vows, in presence of the Gods. Queen. Now Ormasdes! is he fit for pardon? Ormas. Yes Madam, s a distracted person! Near. Why do you wrong my person, and my cause? To call my just Title, a distraction; Do me Justice Cleandra, or give me death! Queen You may have both your wishes in good time: Cleobulus guard him to the Castle. Vale. Pray Madam, let his doom be banishment, Because his Crime, went not beyond intent. Queen. Madam, he must thank you, for his life then; âCleobulus see him a close prisoner, Untill his wounds, permit his banishment. Near. I do your proffer'd mercies, all refuse, And either Death, or Valeriana chuse. Queen. Lead him to banishment: make him obey. Near. Hold alittle:âCleandra looke, this way, Tis Leonatus calls; he who at foyles, The young Prince your Brother, slew; And fled your Fathers rage, (untill his death!) Then shelter'd by this borrow'd Name, return'd, And in Nearcus Family secur'd, By this disguise; liv'd as his onely Son, Who dyed, as I return'd;âis it death yet? Qu. No, this insolence, shall not change your doom, Nor your confest disguise, (long known to me,) Force a punishment beyond the merrit Of that sad mishap! which I believe Was fatall accident! no purpos'd crime! Though my Father look'd on his onely Son, By your hand slain, with such revenging rage! As might his loss become, and him ingage To throw out vows, that Justice should persue So great a Traytor, as he then thought you; For your succession after me, became His fancies object, which encreas'd your blame. âBut I, who have exactly been inform'd, Of my dead Brothers love, and yours, now must For that sad accident, to you be just. Near. I'le rather quit my innocence, then own Your mercy, when you Justice do deny; Give me the fair Princess, or give me death. Queen. I cannot with Justice, give you either; How can I, a free Princes will compell? Or how Ormasdes true pretence deny, Or how afford you death, for that offence, Which your unluckie hand, did act by chance. Near. Wou'd I had dyed, the day of my return, Since great Cleandra dares not do me Right; But suffers false Ormasdes to possess, What is my due; I all your mercy scorn, And will the worst of Tyranny endure. Queen. I have imploy'd you as my Brothers friend, Thus long not at his Murtherer conniv'd! And untill now, by force compell'd my face To frequent smiles, in favor of your worth, While my heart ak'd, to think what you had done! But you of late, unworthy our great Name, Have scandaliz'd the Citherean Fame Boldly to own a Crime so great! as may insence, The world to question your first innocense. Which clearly shews, you are for mischief built, That dar'd to entertain so base aguilt! âMy mercy may prove sin, unless betimes, My Justice do prevent your farther crimes. Near. Must I be held? and baited thus to death! Be torn, and tortur'd by a womans breath? Queen. See my Command obey'd Cleobulus. âI shall take order for an Equipage Fit for your great birth, and shall now confine You to an Island near, from whence you may Return, if you out-live me, and mine! âRemove him hence. Ne. Hold a while!âcurse on, curse light on you all, For this unjustice, which you mercy call; Tyrants, cruel Tyrants, your juggling Art Lay by, and strike a Dagger through my heart; âIf Ormasdes any honour have in store? He'l fight another bout upon the Shore, As I take ship; and if I chance to Dye! My soul shall then applaud thy Victory, And sing thy praise to the infernal Ghosts, That they may chuse thee Captain of their Hosts,â When thou com'st down!âLet not a Ladies word Destroy, by piercing deeper then thy sword!â âWill you not answer? cruel, and unjust! Ye gods! why put you Scepters into womens trust? Who crushes me to raise a Cowards Name! Whom I will in the Elizium fields Defame, No honor'd Ghost of Troy, shall there own thee, The Grecian, and the Roman Souls, with me Will trample on thy Cowards neck with scorn, âPoor shadow of a gallant man, only born To lye in Ladies laps, perfum'd, and curl'd! âI'le Post thee Coward, in the other World. They force him away, on the Queen beck with her hand. the blest Instrument of your escape; the Honour will be ample recompence for any hazzard I shall run: I have Madam, a strong Castle within the Forrest, about a League from hence, thither I can convey you first, and then whither you please. Selin. Pray my Lord, leave me a few minutes, [Exit Cleonel.] that I may consider this great concern:â'tis very like, that he who would have ravish'd, may consent to poyson twenty such as I, rather then loose his hopes of Hungary:âI like well to fly from this near death, but I like not to trust my self to Cleonel, there may be more danger at his Castle, then in the Death I would fly from, If I discover my self unto Ordella, she will solicite me for Phillocles (who I must never hate) this will prove more desperate then all the rest:âI must trust Cleonel, though he be of a fiery Spirit, his honour was never yet tainted:âI will loose gently on [She calls Cleonel.] [He Enters. him, and ingage him if I can to be true to me:â My Lord, I have weighed my dangers, and your counsel to avoid them, and I will trust my self to you, so you will swear to carry me directly unto Belgrad (and not to your Castle) I have friends in Hungary, who will protect me, and there I shall have time to consider of your hazzards for me. Cleo. By our House-hold gods I swear to do it, by this fair hand, I will observe my Oath, and what ever else you shall command me:â though it be late, we must this night depart, you must make ready, while I take order for my Servants, and my Horses. Selin. May I not see the Princess e're I go? will not to morrow night be time enough? Cleo. To morrow night brings death beyond all power to hinder; we should be going while we talk:âLet no fears disturb you Madam, I can command the opening of the Ports at any hour; all shall be according to your wish. Selin. Heaven grant it Cleonelâ When I remember the strict vow you have made, It were Impiety to be afraid. [Exeunt severally. Enter Phillocles, and Guard. Phill. Let the Boy only stay, and sing the Song I like. [Boy.] The SONG. Come, come, thou glorious object of my sight, Oh my Joy! my Life, my only Delight! May this glad minute be Blest to Eternitie. See how the glimmering Tapors of the Skie Do gaze, and wonder at our Constancy; How they crowd to behold! What our armes Do infold! How all do envy our Felicities! And grudge the Triumphs of Selindras eyes. How Cynthia seeks to shroud Her Cressent, in you Cloud! Where sad Night puts her sable mantle on, Thy light mistaking, hasteth to begon; Her Gloomy shades give way, As at the approach of day; And all the Planets shrink, in doubt to be Eclipsed by a brighter deity. Look, Oh look! How the small Lights do fall, And Adore, What before The heavens have not show'n! Nor their god-heads known: Such a faith! Such a Love! As may move Mighty Jove From above To descend; and remain, Amongst Mortals again. Enter Ordella, to visit him as in her Chamber, the Guard at the door appearing. Phill. Thou art welcome Ordella, let us fit, and talk sadly. Ordella. My coming is to divert this sadnesse which you too much indulge. Phill. Does not my sorrow become me Ordella? canst thou wish me merry, when thou considerest my Condition? who is there now in Greece more scorn'd then Phillocles. Admi. Tis strange, that none of us should know him! Young Titus. The general opinion he was drown'd, Made us not see through his disguise; Admir. But his strange passion does amaze me most. Ormasdes wedding, will his frenzy cure; When love does see no possibility, Desires, and hopes, will vanish by degrees. You. Titus. We see dispairs, work often other wayes. Queen. He has disturb'd me, but I'le forget him; âValeriana come, let us consult The Ceremony of your Wedding day, Ormasdes joys, and yours, will blow away The farther thought, of Leonatus crimes. Vale. Our Wedding Madam! I see no reason For so great a hast! now we are secure. Or. Madam, since you have rais'd my hopes so high! It were a sin, to doubt my destiny. Yet say, when shall my thoughts so sixt remain? That I may never think I dream again. Vale. Ormasdes, not too fast, we must proceed With much discretion, to so great a deed! The eyes of all this Nation, do behold Our actions, and may think my part too bold, If I again shall do; what I repent! It would deserve a double punishment; My over-hasty Love, was once my crime, I must redeem that fault, by taking time To finish, what so violent begun, Least into greater errours, I do run;â âA year or two's delay, will add much grace To our young Love, which Time cannot deface. Orma. Why have you led me forth, with gentle gales? Into this dangerous deep? why fill'd my sailes, With such propitious winds? as would convey Me safe to my wish'd Port, the nearest way. Why do you now abstruct this happy course? As if you wish'd for storms! or somthing worse! Why thus forsake the Light? to sail ith'dark, As if you sought out hazzards, for this Bark, In which, you are the onely fraight, that I, Can fear to lose; by my mortality. Oh! do not then my Joyes to time betray, Least you do ruine all, by your delay! Queen. How Valeriana! must this Scene of Love, Fall from its height? and now no farther move! Does your quick conquest of Ormasdes? make Him less worthy? when we such pris'ners take, As might ourselves command! if they will serve! We cannot give them more, then they deserve; Consider well, least you, your self destroy, If thus, you do defer Ormasdes joy! Vale. Madam, you, and the world too well do know, My Love to him, can now no higher grow! I onely thus stand off, least he despise, A conquest gain'd, without an enterprize. And that my injur'd Sex, hereafter may Judge of my innocence, by this delay; Honour forbids, that we in hast ingage, Rash actions often, ill events presage. Though I, (like a tall ship that spreads her sails When she is carried on, with prosperous gales; To her wish'd Port!) do sigh, to be delay'd, And blame the Remora, by which I'm staid. Ormas. Honour, and Fancy, at great distance stand, You have no argument for this command, But your own nice, unnecessary thought, By which your virtue, may become a fault! Tis true, that my neglects to woman kind, May urge, that I should now no favour find; Till my whole life be spent, to gain a bliss, To crown my latests hours with joyes, like this! I do confess such judgement were my due From all the women in the world, but you,â Who have no argument, nor a pretence, Why you, should prove the Rod for my offence. Vale. Ormasdes true, I only now would prove By some short time, the temper of your Love; And shew the world, that mine was not in hast, Though its first motion mov'd so fierce and fast! It makes me blush to think, that this great Queen, And her whole Nation, have such weakness seen! As all commanding Love, forc'd me to show, Oh! tis a bold attempt, when women wooe! Ormas. What ere the vulgar think, great Princes may The dictates of their greater souls obey; Tis a self-doubting sin, when you alone, Dare not avow, what gods, and men do own. Queen. These cautious wayes, are only fit for such As have suspected virtues; you are much Above the reach of Censures;âtwas I, That woo'd him first, mine be the infamy, Who boast the active part, with the successe, And would not for the world, it had been lesse! It does become me, now to see your hands United, as your hearts!âIf my commands Be slighted! and my self not understood! When I require what's for your mutuall good, I shall repent the kindness, I have shown. And wish, you never had Ormasdes known. Vale. Madam, when you command, I must submit; âBut will Ormasdes waking think it fit? Now to accept this Ring? and safer keep What he desires, then when h'last did sleep; I had some pleasure, and no little pain, To put it on, and steal it off again. But now, since gods and you, do all agree! Receive this bond of my Captivity. Ormas. I kiss the hand, that freely gives it now, May Thunder strike me dead, when I do bow To other Earthly Power, or wish a bliss, That Heaven can give, the Gods allowing this! Ormasdes heart, shall into insence turn, And in bright flames, before this Altar burn; So long as my fair Saint, does not despise, To look upon so mean a Sacrificeâ âTo you great Queen, I know not what to say, How to express a gratitude, that may Declare the glory of your life to be A perfect pattern, for Posterity. Qu. Brave Lord, your Triumphs, &amp; your Trophies still Increase our wonder! and our Nation fill With such Esteem, as all my people may, With Honour, keep your Wedding, Holy-Day. And in our Story, after Ages show, Friendship, and Virtue, did together grow. FINIS.</field>
