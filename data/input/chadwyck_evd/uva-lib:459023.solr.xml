      <field name="fulltext">THE Printers Epigrammaticall Epistle to the vnderstanding Reader. Vnknowne to'th Author this faire Courtly Piece Was drawne to'th Presse; not for a Golden Fleece, As doe our Midan Mimickes of these Times, Who hunt out Gaine, with Reasons losse in Rhimes, Heaping together such indigested Stuffe, Can scarce out-beare true Iudgements Counter-buffe: He with a new, choyce, and familiar Straine Strikes full Conceit deepe in the Master-Veyne, Stoopes not for drosse; his profit was his pleasure, Ha's (for his Friends) ransackt the Muses Treasure, Brought thence such lustrous sparkling Iewels forth, As well improue his ScÅnes of reall Worth; Prompt Wit, ripe Art, with Iudgement fell at strife How best t'expresse true Nature to the Life: Yet fild with pleasing Language and so filde, As best beseemes. Minerva's high bred Child: Accept these Straines, as here you find 'em drest By mee the Printer; All stand ready prest At your sole Seruice rightly vnderstand 'em, And if more such I meet with; still command 'em. Your obsequious, in what's good and vertuous. I. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE, AS it was spoken before the KING. Doe not expect strong Lines, nor Mirth, though they Iustly the Towne-wits, and the Vulgar sway: What hope haue we then that our Play can please This more Iudicious Presence, wanting these? We haue a hope (the Author sayes) this Night Loue in our weaknesse shall expresse his might. He in each Noble brest himselfe will place; The Subiect being all Loue then, must finde grace: Yes you may say, if it bee well exprest, Else loue doth censure him from out our brest: Thus what he hop'd should helpe him, if he erre In the expression, turues his Censurer. I for the Author stand, and in his Name Doe here renounce the glory or the shame Of this Nights worke: Great Loue, this Play is thine, Worke Miracles, and shew thy selfe Diuine; Change these rude lines into a sweet smooth Straine, Which were the weake effects of a dull Braine: If in this Prologue Contradictions moue, That best expresses: it was writ by Loue.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus ScÅna prima. Enter Mariana and Lysander. Mariana. Come, prethee tell me brother, why ar't sad. Lys. From thee my dearest Sister I haue not hid my neerest touching secrets: Thou know'st how truly I did loue, And how at last I gain'd my deare Clarinda. Mari. I doe; and wish that I could tell you such a secret of mine owne; for of all men liuing, I thinke you most happy. Lys. Most miserable of men. Mari. How can that be! Tis not Clarinda yours? In which (were I a man) I should beleeue More happinesse consisted, then for to be a Monarch. Lys. Clarinda yet is mine. Mari. Nothing can take her from you but the graue, I hope she is not sicke. Lys. Nothing can take her from me deare Mariana, But I must giue her. Mar. Why, loue you any one so wel to giue away your heart I know shee's dearer to you? Lys. She's so much deerer to me then my heart, That I must kill my heart if I doe giue her. Mari. Be plaine sweet brother. Lys. The Duke who is too neere a kin in loue And bloud to our dread Soueraigne to be deny'd, Dyes for Clarinda. Mar. Why, thinke you shee'l proue false? Lys. Shee false! Oh no: It is I must play the traytor to my selfe Vertue doth vndermine my happinesse, And blowes it vp. I must release my interest In Clarinda, that she may marry this loue-sicke Duke, And saue his Life. Mari. Why who compels it? Lys. Gratitude compels it; For to the Duke I owe my life and fortunes, My fortunes when my wicked Vncle would haue Wrested from me by false witnesse that state Which I am now possest of; which the Duke finding, He imploy'd his power, and so I had my right: My life I then receiued: when I was rescued By his valour from the dreadfull bore, Which I (too young) thrust on by honor, venterd to assayle, Yet all these obligations touch me not so neere, As doth the danger of the Count Utrante, (Clarinda's Father) who hath beene long a prisoner, For the same cause for which my Father fled. Mari. He is now at liberty. Lys. It is true he hath his liberty, and greater honors Are propos'd if he can win his Daughter To marry with the Duke, then he hath lost: But on the other side, if she denye. And it doth wholly lie in me to make her grant, Her Fathers head is in danger, the King So passionately doth loue the Duke. Mari. How came you by this miserable knowledge. Lys. Sister, you know I often visited The Count Utrante in the prison, besides The wish'd occasions which I euer tooke To waite vpon his Daughter thither; This he so gratefully accepted, That now that he hath liberty, He still sends for me, where I chanc'd to be last night, And as a friend heard when he did propound it to Clarinda. Mari. Then he doth no way suspect there's loue betwixt you; But tell me Brother how poore Clarinda Did receiue her Fathers deadly proposition. Lys. Her Father not belieuing that she would deny So great a blessing, came with ioy to tell her, That which once told, forc'd teares from her faire eyes, At which, he being amazed, desired to know The cause, why she receiu'd his and her happinesse With so much sorrow: she answer'd him with broken sighes, Offering to teare her haire; which when I would not, Giue her leaue to doe, she curst her beauty, As the cause of all this mischiefe: at last Considering who it was that spoke, A Father, that deseru'd an answere: Her iudgement shut her passions in a lesse roome; For hauing calm'd the tempest of her greefes, She mildly answer'd that she was happy In his liberty, though now she saw It was but giuen him to procure her bondage; For such she did account all ties of marriage Made by the parents without the childs consent, Though nere so rich or hononrable. Mari. And hauing said so, did she not cast her watry eyes Vpon you, and in this sad, yet pleasing language, Tell you, that she would not forsake you for the Duke. Lys. It is true, shee did so; there is no tongue That can expresse the hearts of those that loue Like their owne eyes: but Sister, it will be late Before you reach the Forrest, the Princesse too May wonder at your stay. Mari. Brother it's true; but I so seldome see you, That I'le not goe, vnlesse you promise to come and see me. Lys. You know the strict command, That none but those appointed should come neere the Lodge. Mari. That is but your excuse; I haue told you how often the Princesse Earnestly hath desir'd to see you; yet you would neuer goe. Lys. Sister, I feare these sad occasions will hinder me; But I will write. Mari. Will you not come sixe miles to see a Sister That so dearely loues you? Lys. Sister, I know you loue, nor will I be a debter; You are both my Friend and Sister. Exeunt. Flourish. Enter King, Utrante, and Attendants. King. My Lord Vtrante, can you not then Perswade your Daughter to receiue a Blessing, Which euen the greatest Ladies in this Kingdome Would desire on their knees: Enter Duke and Followers. Is this a Man to be neglected? Though he were not A Kinsman to your King: besides, my Lord, Remember you may draw vpon your selfe Our high displeasure by her refusall. Duke. Great Sir, let not your loue and care of me Bar faire Clarinda the freedome of her choyce, By threatning punishments vnto her Father, If she choose not me: for, should she, offended, Which she might iustly be, if I should seeme To force Loue from her, it were not within your power; Though that you would giue all that you possesse, To make me satisfaction for the wrong. King. Yes, I could make you satisfaction, Though shee were offended; by forcing her Into your armes, to whom the wrong was done. Duke. Her Person Sir you might, but not her Minde; Which is indeed the obiect of my Loue, That's free from your subiection: for it's free From Loue, a greater power by farre. Utran. My Lord, I thinke shee's free from reason too, For did that gouerne her, she could not thus neglect Her happinesse: or rather she may yet suspect, your Lordship Doth not meane what you professe; and from that feare Seemes coy, till she be more assured. Duke. I cannot pluck my heart out of my brest To shew her (I wish I could) yet liue to doe her seruice: There she might see her worth truely ingrauen In lasting Characters, not to be razed out By the hand of Time; nor (which is more) her scorne. King. Cozen, if you will be rul'd by me, I'le make her leape with ioy into your armes. Duke. Sir, so that it be by no way of violence, I will obey you. King. In act I'le vse no way of violence; Yet I must threaten it. Duke. Sir, if you threaten her, you ruine me; Her Sun-bright Eyes, by faithfull seruice, May in time shine gently on me, and warme My frozen hopes. But on the contrary, Shee knowing thar I'm the cause of these your threatnings, Will from her iust vext soule throw curses on me. I would not see thee heauen of her faire face, Clouded with any raised by my power, to be a Monarch. King. You know my loue, and you presume vpon it, Take your owne way of loue, deliner vp your selfe Vnto her mercy; that I would make at yours, Would you be ruled: go, see your Mistris, Tell her you loue her more then euer man did woman; To proue which true, pray her that shee'l command you Taskes more dangerous, then did the enuious Iuno To great Hercules: all which you will performe With much more ease; since you by her command Shall vndertake 'em whose vertue hath the power To arme you 'gainst a world of dangers: doe, Make her proud with praises, and then see How she will torture you. Duke. Sir, she may torture me, and iustly too, For my presumption: since I haue dared To tell so much perfections that I loue, Not being first made worthy by my suffering For her. Vtran. My Lord, if you'l be pleas'd to grace my house This day she either shall require your sufferings, Or I will deny her for a child of mine. Duke. My Lord, most willing, I would see faire Clarinda, But not vpon such conditions; nothing But gentle intreaties must be vs'd: for tho the King Were pleas'd to say that my humility Would make her proud; I would not haue a subiect? Say, not you that are her Father, that she can Doe an act or thinke a thought that tends not To perfection. King. Come my Lords, we will goe hunt a Stag to day, And leaue my Cozen to his amorous thoughts. Exe. K. Atten. Duke. I thanke your Maiestie for this dayes licence: My Lord Vtrante, shall I then see Clarinda, And will you lend your best assistance To make me Master of a happinesse, the world may enuy. Utran. My Lord, you make an Idol of a peeuish Girle, Who hath indeed no worth but what you please To giue her in your opinion. Duke. I must not heare you thus blaspheme. You might as well say Pallas wanted wisdome, Diana chastitie, or Uenus beautie, As say she wanted worth, for euery seueral excellence That shin'd in them, and made them By mens admirations Goddesses, Flow mixt in her: indeed shee hath Too much of Dians Ice about her heart, And none of Uenus heate: but come my Lord, I lose my selfe in her vast praises, and so Deferre the ioy of seeing what I so commend. Exe. Enter Iacomo and Lysander at seuerall dores. Lys. Good morrow honest Iacomo, is my young Ladie readie? Iaco. She is my Lord. Lys. And where's her Father? Iaco. He was this morning early sent for by the King. Lys. Tell your Ladie I would speake with her. Iaco. My Lord I will. Exit. Lys. The Count Utrante is happie in this honest seruant: Let me before I doe perswade Clarinda, consider well; Surely that houre in which I see her led to the Temple, And there made fast with Hymeneall rights vnto another, Will be my vtmost limit, and death is terrible; Not where there is so glorious a reward propos'd, As is her happinesse: shee shall be happie, And in her happinesse consisteth mine, Haue I not often sworne I lou'd her better Then my selfe? and this is onely left to make it good. Enter Clarinda and Iacomo. Clar. Good morrow noble Brother, for by that title I am proud to call you, being deny'd a neerer. Lys. It is a title that I am blest in, Nor can there be a neerer betwixt vs two, Our soules may embrace, but not our bodies. Clar. Let vs goe walke into the Garden, and there Wee may freely speake, and thinke vpon some remedy Against this disaster. Exeunt Lys. &amp; Clar. Iaco. What a dull Slaue was I; had not I last night ouerheard their louing parley, I neuer once should haue suspected that they had beene in loue: shee alwaies seem'd an enemie to loue, yet hath been long most desperate in loue with this young Lord, which quite will spoyle my hopes at Court; yet when I better thinke, it will be for my aduantage, as I may handle it and further my reuenge; for I will insinuate my selfe into the Dukes good opinion, by making a discouery of their loues: and then aduise him that there is no way to gaine Clarinda's heart, till first Lysander be remou'd by some employment; for out of sight with women out of minde; or if hee impatient of delayes; I will aduise him to vse some bloudy meanes; which if he want an Instrument to do, I will effect it my selfe, pretending that it is out of loue to him when it is indeed the satisfaction of mine owne reuenge; and when the Duke is once a partner of my villany, I will be richly paid for what I do, or else for all his greatnesse I will affright him. For though great men for bloudy deeds Giue money to a Knaue; Yet if hee bee a witty one like mee, Hee'l make that Lord his Slaue. Exit. Enter Clarinda and Lysander. Clar. Come, let vs sit downe, for I am tyr'd With walking; and then I will tell you How I am resolu'd to free vs from this torment. Lys. I feare there is no remedy, but we must part. Clar. Yes, if you will giue consent to what I shall propound. Lys. First let me heare it. Clar. My Father, though he haue his liberty, Is not yet restor'd to his Lands: when next The Duke doth visit me, which I beleeue will Be to day; Ile seeme as if I did mistrust his loue To be but fain'd; he then will striue by some strong Testimony, to proue hee truly loues: Then will I vrge my Fathers restoration To his Lands, which he being once possest of, Will not be hard for me, the world knowing How well he loues me, to get some coine and Iewels In my power, sufficient to maintaine vs In some other Country, where we like shepheards Or some Country folkes may passe our time with ioy: And that we may without distrust effect this, I to the Duke will promise, that when a moneth Is expir'd, if he will come and lead me to the Church, I'le not refuse to goe, doe you approue Of this Lysander? Lys. No, deare Clarinda, Though most men hold deceit in loue for lawfull, Lysander doth not; Ere you for me shall spot Your yet pure selfe with such a staine, as to be A deceiuer, this sword shall pierce my heart: The debt I owe you is too great already, And till I cleere some part, I shall vnto my selfe Appeare a most vngratefull man, When first I saw you, The height of all my aymes was onely to haue leaue To loue you, so excellent I then esteem'd you: But you in time, out of your bounty, Not for my desert; for no desert can reach Your height of merit, gaue loue for loue, For which I owe my life sau'd by that mercy From despaire, and lent me for to serue you. Clar. You are too thankfull, and attribute that To my bounty, which was the wages of your true And faithfull seruice. Lys. Were this granted, yet how euer I shall be able To free my selfe from that great burden of debt Which your intended flight for my sake Will lay vpon me, as yet I cannot see; For did at all value your owne happinesse, You could not thus flie the meanes That can best make you so. Clar. Lysander, to what tends this great acknowlegement? I vnderstand you not, what is your meaning? Lys. My meaning, deare Clarinda, is to make you happie, And I coniure you by your affection, And all that's deare to you, to lay by That little portion of wilfulnesse Which being a woman you are forc'd to haue, And heare me with your best attention, And with the same affection, as if I were Your Brother, which if the heauens had pleas'd To make me, I had beene most happy, With your best reason looke vpon your present fortune; Looke first vpon the man from whence you had your being, And see in reason what pitty it will challenge from you; A noble ancient Gentleman, depriu'd of Lands And honors, by iniustice, that as a stranger Might exact your pitty; but as a Child, It being within your power, it forceth your consent. To giue a remedy: If pity of your Fathers fortune Cannot moue you, pitty your owne I beseech you, Consider not of me as a tormented Louer, That hath lost his Mistris, but as a fortunate Brother, Fortunate in seeing of his Sister, whom he dearly loues Married to one so worthy, whose merits Compels fortune to waite vpon him, for such the Duke is, Whom you must not refuse, for such a poore Vnworthy man as I am. Clar. Lysander, should I grant your want of worth, I then must giue consent to the committing Of a Sacriledge against the Gods, in suffering you To rob your selfe, you being the purest Temple, That yet they euer built for to be honour'd in: And for the Duke each worth which you expresse of him to me, Is but a doubling of your owne, The way to speake for him, were to appeare Your selfe lesse, worthy, in this your worths increase. Lys. Would you but looke with an impartiall eye, On our deseruings; you soone would find me The lesse worthy; for euen in that, wherein You thinke me not to be equal'd, he goes Farre beyond me, (I meane in true affection) For being but a priuate man as I am, Who would not thinke him blest to loue, and be belou'd By you that are esteem'd the wonder of this Age: But for the Duke, within whose power it lies To choose the most transplendent Beauty of this Kingdome, Set off wirh Fortunes best endowments; for him, I say, To choose out you amongst a world of Ladies, To make the sole Commandresse of him selfe, Deserues (if you would giue your reason leaue to rule) The neerest place in your affection. Clar. Doe not thus vainly striue to alter my opinion, Of your worth with words, which was so firmly grounded By your reall actions; it is a fault, but I will striue To wash it from you with my teares. Lys. These teares in her stagger my resolution; For sure he must be worthiest for whom she weepes: Clarinda, drie your eyes. Enter Iasper. Clar. How now Iasper, where is my Father? Ias. Madame, he doth desire that you will make you ready, To come to Supper to the Dukes to night. Clar. He was resolued to haue sup'd heere, How hath he chang'd his mind! Ias. Madame he desires you not to fayle, But come and bring my Lord here with you. Clar. Well, I will obey him. Exeunt. Enter two Seruants. 1. Come, prethee be carefull, we shall gaine More vpon my Lords good opinion, If we please him this day, then hereafter In the whole seruice of our liues. 2. Why prethee? 1. Here will this day be his faire Mistris Clarinda And her Father. 2. I thought it was some extraordinary occasion, He was himselfe so carefull; will there be none else? Will not the King be here? the entertainment Would be worthy of him. 1. It may be braue Lysander will be here, none else; For he is alwayes with the Count Utrante. 2. When came he home from trauaile? I did not see him since hee lay here in my Lords house To be cured of the wounds the bore gaue him. He owes my Lord for sauing of his life then, I helpt to bring him out of the field. 1. My Lord was happy in sauing of so braue a Gentleman. Enter Lysander, Utrante, and Clarinda. Lys. Can I loue Clarinda, yet goe about To hinder her of being Mistris of all this riches; Each roome we passe through is a Paradise, The Musicke like the Musicke of the Spheares, Rauishing the hearers with content and admiration; But that which addes vnto all the rest, Is the Dukes true affection; I am asham'd When I consider of my indiscretion That would haue brought her to the counterpoynt Of this great happinesse. Enter Duke and Followers. Duke. Noble Lysander, welcome; Excellent Lady, All the honors that my great and royall Master Hath bestow'd vpon me, equals not this, That you haue done, in gracing at my request This now most glorious house, since it containes within it The glory of the world. Clar. My Lord, your praises flie too hie a pitch to light on. Duke. They must doe so, or they'l fall short Of your great worth. Clar. A reasonable pitch would sooner strike Me with beliefe. Duke. To giue you a firme beleefe of the respect I beare you, is that I onely ayme at. Clar. My Lord, it lyeth in your choyce whether I shall Belieue you or no; for if you will speake Only that which in reason is likely to be true, I am no Infidell, I shall beleeue. Duke. You are so farre from being an Infidel That you are a Saint, at whose blest shrine I offer vp my life, and Fortunes With a truer deuotion then euer Louer did. Clar. I see I must allow you the Louers Phrases. Which is to call their Mistris St. and their affection Deuotion: but to let your Phrases passe, And answere the meaning of your protestation, How can I belieue that you can loue me Better then any man did euer loue his Mistris, There being such an inequalitie in our present fortunes, When equalitie doth giue birth to more affection, And those more violent, there being no respect To be a hindrance, I meane both the equalities Of Birth and Fortunes, in both which we farre differ, You being the next a kin vnto the King, And I the Daughter to a condem'd man, Though now for your owne ends at liberty. Duke. If it be lawfull for your deuoted seruant To contradict you in any thing, it is In the defence of his affection. You know that Riuers being stopt by any impediment, As rocks, or bridges, run the more fierce When they are from that which did incomber them; So might I say for my affection, If I should acknowledge, which yet I will not, That the consideration of my Greatnesse Was for a while an Impediment to the current Of my Loue; but alas, those considerations Could neuer finde harbor in that heart Where loue and admiration had already Taken vp their lodgng; nor doe they in my opinion Deserue to be happy, who mixe the consideration Of the good of fortune, with their affections. Clar. My Lord, in this last I doe vnfainedly belieue you, I meane in your opinion, which is, that true loue Cannot be mixt with respects, and to shew now How well I belieue you, I will make it my shield Both to defend me against your worthy affection. (I confesse if your thoughts and words agree) And against my Fathers vniust commands; For since you confesse, that to mixe loue with respects Spoyles the puritie of it, and that they Who so mixe it, deserue not to be happy; It must needs be great iniustice in you And my Father to desire me to loue you Vnworthily; since I cannot loue you Without mixing the consideration Of the benefits my Father shall receiue By my Marriage with your Grace, besides The satisfaction of me owne ambition In being a Dutchesse, may make any streame Of affection which can proceed from me, Vnfit to mixe with so pure a streame As you professe yours is. Duke. Madame I cannot denie what you affirme, Since you ground your argument vpon my confest Opinion; but know deare Lady, that as you manifest In this your cruell answere, your disdaine of me, Which will incense my despaire; yet on the Other side the excellence of your wit Will increase my desire, for euen out of that Which I brought as an argument to moue you The more to loue, you conclude that you are To neglect, and with a seeming Iustice, Which shews that your wit can bring-ny thing To passe, that your will shall employ it in. Clar. I should account my selfe happie, were I So furnished: but my Lord, I must not looke Vpon my selfe in the flattering glasse Of your praises; for I hate flattery though a woman; And as I am my selfe armd' against flatterie, So would I haue you be; therefore I tell you That I can neuer be yours, to arme you against The flatterie of hope; yet I must tell you That your deserts, if it were possible For me to loue, might sooner doe it then any other, But as I am a votresse to Diana, in whose Temple I doe shortly meane to dwell, I am free From any fire that can bee kindled By desert in Man. Duke. Tho your intention in this cruell answere May bee charitable, as intending To allay my heat, by manifesting your boldnesse, Yet it hath wrought deadly Effects; for it Forceth me tell you, that I must disobey you: For rather then I and the rest of the world Will lose so great a blessing, there shall not Be a Temple left standing, that is sacred To Diana within this Kingdome, when this is done, To make your crueltie admir'd. Ile build An Alter to selfe-lone; it is that power you obey, And not Diana's, on which some frend shall lay My bleeding heart, which now in thought, And then in act, shall be a reall Sacrifice: Smile not, nor thinke this iest; For by that Dian whom you seeme to worship Being your selfe a greater Deitie, When you doe cruelly performe what You haue rashly said, this heart Which now seales what my tongue hath spoke, Shall make the couenant perfect. Clar. I see this is no way my Lord, This rash oath you haue made, may cost you deare. Duke. In that consider the greatnesse of my loue. Clar. The greatnesse of your folly rather, That thinke by threatning punishments to your selfe, To make me pitty you, when since I doe not loue you, I am not toucht with any feeling of your greefes. Duke. If not for mine, yet for your Goddesse sake, Giue ouer your ill grounded resolution. Enter Bernardo. Ber. My Lord the King is newly lighted at the garden gate. And in all hast cals for you. Duke. Madame the King, to whom my person is a subiect, Commands my presence, and I must obey him: But my heart which I haue made you Soueraigne of Shall stay to wait on you; my returne must needs Be speedy, since I leaue my heart at the mercy Of you my cruell enemy. Clar. My Lord I shall so martyr it before I come agen. That you will repent you. Duke. You cannot giue it deeper wounds Then you haue done already, and in that Confidence Ile leaue you. Ber. Madame, will it please you walke into the gallery, There are some pictures will be worth your seeing. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus ScÅna prima. Enter King, Attendants, Iacomo, Duke and Followers meeting. King. Will none go call the Duke? Welcome deare Cozen; You lost a braue chase to day, but you had other game A foote: what sayes your cruell Mistris will she loue you? Duke. I hope she will Sir, she doth heare me speake. King. How heare you speake? Duke. Of loue I meane Sir. King. Fye, passionate man. Duke. Why Sir, doe you not thinke him happie Whom she will vouchsafe to heare? King. You know my loue hath made you what you are Out of an opinion that you deserud it; Not for that you were my Kinsman. I neuer yet deny'd What you would aske, relying on your iudgement And your vertue. Should you haue ask'd my Sister, For your Wife, I sooner should haue giuen consent And taxt your iudgement lesse, then I doe now For doting on this Lady. Call backe for shame then That iudgement which had wont to gouerne all Your actions, and make me once more proud That I haue such a Kinsman, whose iudgement Can controule his strongest passions, euen loue it selfe, When it is preiudiciall to his honor. Duke. Sir, You haue alwayes beene a Father to me, And studyed that which hath beene for my good, Better then I could thinke. I know your Maiesties Intent in this, is to perswade me from that Which you belieue is preiudiciall to me: But since without her loue gain'd the faire way Of seruice, not by threatnings I can take ioy, In nothing this world can afford me; Pardon me Sir, if I desire you to spare Your Counsell, since I am capable of none, Except you perswade me to loue more. King. Well Sir, I will leaue you to your amorous passions, See me no more till I send for you. Exeunt King, Atten. Duke. The King is mou'd; Should he take from me all that he hath giu'n me, Yet it were a happinesse, if for her sake I lost it. Iaco. My noble Lord. Duke. Friend, what is your suit to me? If it be reasonable, it shall not bee deny'd For your young Ladies sake. Iaco. My Lord, the businesse I haue to deliuer, Concernes your Grace. Duke. How! me; what is it? speake. Iaco. My Lord, it is a secret, and doth concerne Clarinda, And therefore send your people off, That with more freedome I may speake with you. Duke. Waite me without, now speake. Exeunt Seruants. Iaco. What thinks your Lordship is the cause That moues Clarinda to neglect your Loue? Du. The knowledge of her own worth and my vnworthines, Which defect I hope in time my faithfull seruice Shall make good, and she will loue me. Iaco. Neuer, my Lord. Duke. Why, is her vow of Chastity already past? Iaco. Shee vow Chastitie! Duke. Why villaine dost thou smile at that, Think'st thou Diana's selfe is Chaster? Iaco. Great Sir, mistake me not. I smile to thinke How she deceiues your Grace, telling you She neuer meanes to marrie, when I dare Pawne my life she is already contracted. Duke. Traitor to my best hopes; Thou hast kindled in my brest a iealous fire That will consume me; fiends take thee for thy newes; Would thou hadst beene borne dumbe: betrothd; it cannot be: Who durst presume, knowing I lou'd her once, To thinke of Loue, much lesse to name it to her? Iacom. My Lord, if you will with patience heare me, I will tell you whom. Duke. Speake quickly, giue me that ease. For I vow the earth shall not long beare vs both. I will not tell you, vnlesse you will promise To follow my aduice, which if you will, I will shew you a cleare way to your desires. Duke. What, do you riddle me; is she contracted, And can I by your counsell attaine my wishes? No, the House of Fate, though they should all Take Counsell, cannot backe restore the happinesse Th'ast rob'd me of in saying shee's contracted. Iaco. My Lord, do not thus wast your selfe In fruitlesse passion, but heare the remedy That Ile propound. Du. First let me know which of the Gods it is, That in a mortall shape hath gain'd her loue, That thou suspect'st she is contracted, Or else some King, that in disguise hath left His Kingdome, to obtaine her Loue Who is worth many Kingdomes. Name not a meaner Riuall, if thou dost Expect I should belieue. Iaco. My Lord, it is a man, to whom Your valorous hand gaue life. Du. Curst be my hand then for that vnkinde office, Against my heart; name him. Iaco. It is the young Lord Lysander. Du. Take that ignorant foole, Lysander! Strikes him. Iaco. How! strucke: is this my hop't reward? By all that's good, Ile be reueng'd. Duke. I was too rash, She is a Woman, and may dissemble, Lysander to Is noble courteous valiant, handsome; But yet compar'd with me his fortunes nothing. Alas, that cannot barr loue, out of a noble breast, Such as Clarinda's is: what wayes my Birth Or greatnesse with the King, in her consideration? Lysanders equall fortunes, and her owne, In that their Fathers suffer for one cause, His banisht, hers a prisoner (till I releast him) Hath I feare, begot a mutuall loue betwixt them. Friend, prethee pardon me, I was too rash, Ile heale thy hurt with gold. Iaco. My Lord, I am a Gentleman, And were you not a Kinsman to the King. The blow you gaue me might haue cost you deare. Duke. Ile heale thy reputation, and thy head With store of crownes; here: but prethee tell me, What mou'd thee to discouer this to me? Or how camst thou thy selfe to know of it? I thinke her Father doth not. Iaco. I thinke he doth not, it is long since, Since I suspected it; and to assure my selfe, The other night I crept behind the Arbour, Where they vse to meet somtimes, and soon by their Discourse, I found what I suspected, to be most true: My loue vnto your Grace made me so curious; For I protest there is no man aliue, That's more ambitious to do your Lordship seruice; It grieu'd my soule to see a man that so deseru'd, So much neglected and abus'd. Some of this is true. Duke. If thou wilt make thy fortune, Bring me where vnseene, I may ouerheare them. Iaco. So your Grace will not discouer your selfe, Ile promise you once within three nights. Duke. By mine honour I will not, performe Thy promise, and I will make thee happie. Iaco. Be sure you shew not At your returne to them the least distemper. Duke. Feare not that. Exeunt. Enter Clarinda, Vtrante, Lysander, Bernardo. Clar. Sir, you haue shew'd vs many Pictures; But aboue all the rest, I like that of your Lords. Ber. Madame, I know my Lord would thinke him happie Would you accept the picture; but much happier If you would take the substance. Clar. It may be Sir I will. Utran. Daughter, I charge you on my blessing, When the Duke returnes to vse him with respect. Clar. Father, I see you haue no skill, you doe not know The craft we women vse to make men loue the more; The smallest fauour I shall shew him after this harsh vsage, Will make him thinke himsele in heauen. Utran. Before you part, when he comes backe, I pray you vrge my restoration, But first promise to marry him. Clar. Leaue that to my Discretion Enter Duke. Duke. Gentle Lady, I craue your pardon for my stay, Which was drawne out beyond my expectation. Lys. Me thinkes my Lord looks soure vpon me. Clar. My Lord, indeed I wondred how you stayd so long, Or rather how you liu'd your heart and you being parted; For that you left behind you when you went. Duke. Madame, I doe confesse it is a miracle Proceeding from your beauty, that I could liue So long wanting a heart; but trust me, If my faithfull seruice cannot procure me yours, But that you needs will send my owne againe, The Miracle will then be alterd quite; For now the Miracle consisteth in that I liue And yet you haue my heart; and then it will Be a Miracle indeed if I doe liue after Your scorne shall giue it backe againe. Clar. My Lord, I see it was not bounty But hope of gaine made you giue me your heart; For you expect that I should giue you mine By way of recompence, which yet I cannot doe: But that I may be sure they are true Miracles That you are pleas'd to say my Beauty worketh; For there are many false ones here in Loues Religion; Ile take a Moneth for tryall of the truth, All which time my charity compels me to keepe your heart; For should I send it backe, you say it would kill you, Or worke another Miracle, which I desire not, In that time I shall be acquainted with your heart, If then it doth appeare the same it now doth, Clad in the same pure zeale that now it weares, Ile make a change, and giue you mine for it; For when a Moneth is once past, come you And lead me to the Church, Ile not refuse to goe. Du. Slaue that I was to trust that villaine Iacomo, That told me she lou'd Lysander. Deare Lady You haue in this comfortable answere Reuiu'd a dying man, this mercy at the blocke, Shewes you to be diuine, and so an obiect Fit for my affection, which hath beene still Aboue my reason: but would you in the mean time Command me somthing, where my faithfull seruice Might appeare, more then in words, I then should be Most happie. Enter Seruants with a Banquet and stooles. Clar. This offer I expected; My Lord, you know the iniuries my Father Hath receiu'd: if you will see him righted, His Lands and Honors backe to him restor'd, Which is but Iustice for a bribe, for euen iust causes Now haue need of bribery: Ile giue you thankes, And trust me that is more then great men Should expect for doing iustice. Duke. Rather if it please you, Let it be somthing, wherein I shall haue no other tie Vpon me but only your command, my honor Ties me to see this perform'd. Clar. This once perform'd, Since you so much desire it, I will studie Some Command, that may adde honor to you In the faire performance. Utran. Come my Lord, we will draw neare, I see their parley's at an end. Duke. Come sit faire Lady. My Lord, what sayes my Daughter? Will shee yet yeeld to his owne happinesse. Du. I hope she wil at last make me a fitter marke For Enuy, in that I am belou'd of her, Then for my present greatnesse. Lys. My Lord, there is no cause of Enuy for either, The greatnesse of your hnors being but the Iust Reward of your vnequal'd merit: and for Clarinda, Tho her worth be great as yon can wish it; Yet you doe well deserue her, both for your worthy Loue, And for the many fauors you haue done her Father. Utran. My Lord, belieue me, he hath spoke my thoughts. Duke. Now when the King sent for me, I had preuented Your Daughter in a command that she layd vpon me Concerning your restoring to your Landes, But that the King was angry at something that I said. Lys. I thought it had beene Impossible, He could haue beene offended with your Grace. Duke. 'Tis true, at other times he could not, But the Lords told me that his Sister Faire Cleonarda, had receiud a hurt, By rescuing of the hounds from the Stags fury, When he stood at bay, and that made him it may be So apt for to be angry. Lys. Why did they suffer her so to endanger her selfe? Du. My Lord, she apprehends not danger, Which you'l confesse your selfe, when you haue heard Me tell, what I haue seene her doe. Lys. This act to me my Lord, is a sufficient testimony That she doth not feare: for by the lawes of hunting It is not to any man thought a disparagement, To giue way to a Stagge, his head being hard. Du. She is a Lady of that noble Spirit, That she wants nothing but the person of a Man To be one, her heart being equall To the most valiant, with these eyes I saw her, (The King her brother being in the Forrest) Breake from the company, and pursue a wolfe, Which the hounds following of a Stagge, Did bring out of a thicket, and being well horst, She ply'd him with so many wounding shafts, That he at length was forc'd to stay his course, And seing there was no way to scape by flight, He turnd', for to reuenge the wounds he had Receiu'd, in which he shew'd himselfe a beast indeed And led by bruitish fury; for had he beene Indew'd with reason, hee'd haue tane the wounds She gaue for fauors, and kist the instrument, That honour'd him with death from her faire hand. Lys. My Lord, 'tis strange a woman should do this. Duke. I was the near'st, but ere I could come in She had cut off his head, the seruice. That I could doe her, was to carry to the King Her brother, that Trophee of her Victory, Whilst she followed the hownds, and so fled From the hearing of her owne iust praises, Which all with admiration did bestow vpon her. Utran. But that your Grace doth tell it, I should not thinke a woman could doe this. Clar. My Lord, did I loue you so well as to be iealous, These praises of the Princesse, were apt food For it to feed on. Duke. Madame, I honour her as the beloued Sister Of my Soueraigne; but adore you as my Goddesse, At whose blest shrine, I offer vp my life, and fortunes. Clar. My Lord, I should accompt it as the most acceptable Seruice that you could doe, to bring me to kisse the hands Of this much to be admir'd Lady. Duke. Madame, once euery week She comes to see the King, And the King euery time he hunts, failes not To see her, when next she comes to the Court, I will wait vpon you to her. Clar. What is the reason She liues not with her brother at the Court, Since he so dearly loues her as they say? Du. It's certainc no Brother loues a Sister better, For there's no Brother hath a Sister so worthy, You hauing neuer a Brother. Clar. My Lord, 'tis late; And though heretofore the company of a Father Were a sufficient buckler to beare off slanders darts; Yet now world is changed, growne so vicious, That Fathers are become the likeliest Instruments Of sin, and women are not to satisfie themselues Alone, with being good; but they must giue the world A firme beliefe of all their actions, That they are so; there may be some seing me here Thus late, that will not sticke to say, my honour Is the bribe paid for my Fathers restoration. Du. Though there were found one enuious woman foolish And wicked to report it; (for both these she must be) There could not sure be found another Fiend Of the same stampe, that would belieue it; I dare not though I wish it bid you stay longer: I will wait vpon you to your Coach. Clar. My Lord, it shall not need. Utran. My Lord, I hope it will not be long Before this ceremony of parting will be quite lost, And that you will not be so farre asunder. Duke. In hope of that blest houre I liue. Clar. Doe not too strongly apprehend your happinesse, A month's a long time, all things are vncertaine, Especially the promises of women. Exeunt. Enter Iacomo. Iaco. Fortune, I see thou art a friend to working spirits, Thou wouldst not else haue giuen me this occasion So soone to compasse my ends by; I ouer-heard Clarinda, When she intreated Lysander to meete her in the Accustom'd place, and thither will I bring the Duke. He from Clarinda's promise of Marriage, Is now growne something doubtfull, whether that Which I did tell him be true or no; but now his owne eare Shall be his witnesse; for which seruice he cannot choose But both loue an reward me. But I lose precious time, which wise men euer Consider of, but fooles seldome or neuer. Exit. Enter Clarinda, and Lysander, (as in an Arbour) in the night. Lys. Had you not sent me word, I had not come to night, It is so darke. Clar. It is darke indeed, the fitter for one orecharged With griefe in heart as I am. Lys. Why deare Clarinda, are you not resolu'd To marry with the Duke? Clar. I see Lysander you doe not loue me now, Nor wish my happinesse, you would not else Perswade me from louing you, wherein it only Can consist. Lys. Will you still for the ayery name of Constant, Rob your selfe of a substantiall happinesse, Besides, thinke what duty bids you, doe it In respect of your Father; if he should marry He must needs fall into the Kings displeasure, He being his Kinsman, so what happinesse Could you inioy? Will you be rul'd by me, And Ile shew you a direct way to happinesse; Doe you loue me as you professe? Enter Duke and Iacomo. Clar. You know I loue you more Then I haue words to vtter. Lys. Yet you would neuer giue consent to marry me Though it were still my Suite, alleadging That our fortunes were too meane, and had we Without Marriage inioy'd the sweets of loue, It had beene dangerous vnto your honour, Should you haue prou'd with child; but will be now Secure in that respect, if you marry with the Duke; And for our difficulty in meeting, 'Twill adde to our delights; now euery time That we shall meete in secret, will farre passe A wedding-night in ioy, stolne pleasures giue An appetite, secure delights but cloy. Duke. O my vext soule! Must I then heare a villaine speake thus to her I loue, and not reuenge it presently? Iaco. My Lord, remember your soule Oath. Clar. Lysander, why d'ye stare so and look pale? Your hayre stands vp an end, as if your sense Began to faile you sure you are falne mad, Nay, I doe hope you are so; for if you be not, I am more miserable then if you were: For, can Lysander be himselfe, and speake thus To his Clarinda? No, he cannot: either Lysander Is chang'd from what he was; or else he neuer Was what I esteemd him, either of which Makes me most miserable. Lys. You would seeme to thinke me mad, when indeed Yourselfe are so, you would not else thus weepe When I aduise you to that which will be most to our content. Clar. Pardon me Lysander, that I haue seemed For to beleeue; for sure I did no more, That which you haue spoke proceeded from your heart. Lys. Why doe you thinke that I dissembled in what I said. Clar. Yes, Lysander; I know you did dissemble; For if you did not, you were a loathed villaine. Lys. I doe confesse if I were that Lysander Which I haue seem'd to be; it were impossible For me to thinke what I haue spoke; but know Clarinda, Though hitherto I haue seemed To carry in my brest a flame so pure, That neuer yet a sparke of Lust appear'd, It hath beene a dissembled shew of modestie, Only to cozen you; and if Clarinda, The requitall of my affecton be that which Hinders you from these great honors, be not deceiu'd, For you shall haue more power then to requite it, When you are greater: we are now equall; But when you are a Dutchesse, then t'enjoy you Will be a double pleasure, then you shall haue Occasion to expresse your loue in my aduancement Duke. Ile kill him instantly. Iaco. Your oath my Lord. Duke. The merit of the act being so iust, Will expiate the sinne of periurie. Iaco. My Lord, Duke. What, shall I heare her whom I haue ador'd Almost with as much zeale as I haue offer'd vp My prayers to the Gods, tempted to acts of Lust And not reuenge it? Iaco. My Lord, heare me but speake, and then doe what you will: if you should thus in the night, and in the house of the Count Utrante kill Lord Lysander, your honour Clarinda's, and her Fathers would be tainted, and so breed strange combustions: but if you be resolu'd that he must die, which in my iudgement is most necessary, if you still loue Clarinda, I will vndertake for to dispatch him by some meanes or other; but should you now here in Clarinda's presence kill him she loues, her mind is so noble she would neuer indure you. Duke. This is a villaine, an incarnate Diuell; Yet will I follow some part of his counsell: Lead me the way backe vnseene. Ile stay no longer; For if I heare him speake againe in that base Key, I shall doe that which I hereafter may repent. No. Ile take the noblest way to my reuengement. Exit. Lys. Clarinda, you haue long beene silent, What is it you consider of? if it bee my words, You must needs find them full of reason. Clar. Ile seeme as base as he would haue me, And so find out whether he speaks this from His heart or no. Clar. I must confesse that this which you haue spoken Stands with good reason; and reason is the rule By which we ought to square our actions: Dare I belieue that you would counsell me To any thing, but that which will be most For my content, and for the Duke, will it not be Farre lesse to his content, not to enioy at all Me whom he loues, then if he should possesse me, And yet you haue a share with him in my embracings: For what is that husband worse, whose wife abuses him, If she haue but the wit to keepe it from his knowledge. Lys. It is true the Duke is so noble, and doth withall So truely loue you, that it will quite banish All base distrust, so that we might with all security Inioy our loues. Clar. Leaue, leaue. Lys. Or if he should find out our craft, How soone might we dispatch him by poyson? There haue beene such things done. Clar. You doe ouer-act your part, I see the end you ayme at, your vertue shewes it selfe Quite through that maske of vice, which loue to me And to my Father made you put on; you thought If you could haue giuen me a beliefe Of your vnworthines, that then I would haue giuen Consent to haue married with the Duke: Leaue your dissembling then, since y'are discouerd, Lest you offend the Gods; I only seem'd To giue applause to what you said, to finde Your crafte. Lys. I see my heart lies open to you, You haue spoken my very thoughts, indeed This was my end. Clar. Lysander, I perceiue that your affection Is altogether gouern'd by your reason, For which if it be possible, I loue you more, Because it well becomes a man to doe so: But I should hate my selfe, if I should loue According to your rule, which I will manifest; For here I take the heauens to witnesse, That if within three dayes you do not marry me, Ile kill my selfe, speake quickly; for if you do not Loue me, it is a greater mercy to tell me so, (That I may dye) then to perswade me To loue another, that being impossible, But death is easie. Lys. Clarinda, you haue ouercome by this rash oath My resolution: for I perceiue the fates Had fore-ordain'd we should enioy each other, After such reall testimonies, to make our loue the firmer. I doe with ioy embrace what you compell Me to by your rash oath; and if your Father Wilfully will stay, and not flye with vs, Rather then I will euer draw teares From those bright eyes. I so dearly loue, wee'l leaue him to the danger. Exeunt. Enter the Duke with two Letters. Duke. Shall I stil loue one that neglects my faithfull seruice? Alacke I cannot helpe it now, I yeelded vp My heart at the first summons, her faire eyes made, Me thought it was a kind of treason, once To doubt that she was not the soueraigne of all hearts: Thus she that came to Court, to beg her Fathers liberty, Had not that granted only, but that I who beg'd It for her, became my selfe her prisoner, And neuer man was prouder of his bondage Then I was: what though she loue a villaine Whose intemperate lust, and base dissembling, Kather deserues her hate; yet shee is faire And vertuous still, it is my part to let her See her error, tho with danger of my life, If I suruiue the combat, and that she know For what respect I fought, she cannot choose But loue me, and if the heauens haue so ordained, That I must fall vnder Lysanders sword, Yet I haue written that, which shall giue a better Testimony that I did loue her more then he. Who waits there? Enter Francisco and Bernardo. Fran. My Lord. Duke. I meane to ride abroad this morning, And if I come not backe at night, carry this letter To the King; Bernardo, carry this presently Vnto the young Lord Lysander. Exeunt. Enter Iacomo. Iaco. My plots are dasht, the Duke doth turne his eyes vpon me as though he would looke me dead, I shall gaine hate on all sides, if I bee not wary and cunningly dissemble; reuenge and profit are the ends I ayme at; since I haue mist the one, Ile make the other sure. Lysander, I doe hate thee for comming into the world to rob me of my land; yet I doe thinke thou art not onely false; my Brother did tricks, which when I would haue proued in open Court the Dukes power boulstred vp against me; but I doe hope I shall be now reueng'd vpon them both. Ile poyson the Duke my selfe, and to the King accuse Lysander, as if he had done it, fearing that the Duke should rob him of his Mistris; I haue a seruant shall sweare what I would haue him, I keepe him for the purpose; since the Duke would not giue me leaue to vse my drugges for him, he shall himselfe taste of them; lest for that kindnesse I offer'd him, I should my selfe bee punish'd: Hee that to honor looks is not for my blacke ends, Reuenge &amp; profit Ile pursue through blood of foes and friends. Enter Lysander and Bernardo. Lys. Where is the Duke Sir? Ber. He is this morning ridden forth, Whither I doe not know. Lys. Your Letter Sir, do's not require an answere, It will not be long before I see his Grace my selfe. Ber. Good morrow to your Lordship. Lys. Good morrow Sir, Ile read them once more ouer, Hee reads. Though the small number of Lines seeme not to require it, Lysander, I wait for you at the great Elme within the Forrest: make hast, and to preuent danger, come arm'd. Few words, but I belieue a Prologue to much mischiefe. I feare that my affection and Clarinda's Is to the Duke discouer'd; and now disdaine And anger to be out-riual'd, boyle within his brest, If it be so, he takes the noblest way, To vse no other force but his owne arme: But how shall I imploy my Sword to take His life that gaue me mine, my conscience tels me Though it be not apparant to the world, That I am euen with him; for that since I to him Would haue giuen vp my interest in Clarinda, Would she haue giuen consent. It may be I am deceiud in this my apprehension, And that it is in loue he sends for me; If it be so, I shall be glad; if not, howeuer I will meete him according to his desire; But first Ile write a Letter to Clarinda, It may be I shall neuer see her more: If I come not home to night, carry a Letter You shall find within vpon the Table to Clarinda: Honour thou tiest vs men to strange conditions; For rather then weel lose the smallest part of thee, We on an euen lay venture Soules and Bodies, For so they doe that enter single Combats. Exeunt. Enter Cleonarda, and Mariana. Cleo. It is hot Mariana; wee'l rest our selues a while, And when the day growes cooler haue another course. Mari. I wonder how the Deere escaped; the follow-dog Once pinch'd him. Cleo. It was the bushes sau'd him. Mari. Why will you course among the bushes? Gerard the Keeper would haue brought you To a fairer course; but you will neuer let Him goe along. Cleo. I hate to haue a tutor in my sport, I will finde and kill my Game my selfe; What satisfaction is't to me if by anothers skill I purchase any thing? Mari, Yet you must haue Your husband chosen to your hand; the King your Brother Will take that paines for you. Cleo. He shall haue leaue to name me one; But if I doe not thinke him worthy of me, Ile breake that Kingly custome, of marrying For the good of the State; since it makes Princes More miserable then Beggers; for Beggers marry Only those they loue. Mar. Madame, it's true, we not alone in Princes See the bitter effects of such forc'd Marriages; But euen in priuate Families, Murders and Adulteries, doe often wait vpon those Couples Whose Bodies are compeld by Parents or Friends To ioyne for worldly respects, without the soules consent. Cleo. 'Tis true Mariana, how many carefull Parents That loue their children dearly, thinking To make them happy by marrying of them richly, Make them miserable, both here and in the other world. Mari. Madame, 'tis very hot, will you goe bathe your selfe In the Riuer. Cleo. With all my heart Mariana, It will refresh vs well against the Euening; I am resolu'd to kill a Deere to night, Without the Keepers helpe. Exeunt. Enter Duke and Lysander. Lys. I hope your Grace hath not long staid for me. Duke. No, Lysander, you are come before My expectation, though not before my wish: You cannot guesse the cause that I sent for you. Lys. My Lord, I cannot, Vnlesse fortune be so fauorable to giue me A faire and iust occasion by being your Second, To hazzard that life for you, which by your valour Was preserud; but why to hope so great a blessing I cannot see; since who within this Kingdome Dare iniure you; yet you commanded That I should come arm'd. Du. For being my Second, banish that thought, And yet I meane to fight to day, and for an iniury That is done to me; and you Lysander shall fight to, Not as a Second, but a Principall. Lys. With whom? Duk. With me Lysander. Lys. With you my Lord, vpon what quarrell. Duk. I will maintaine that I doe loue Clarinda Better then you, and better doe deserue To be beloued by her. Lys. My Lord, I doe confesse it, And so this cannot be a cause of quarrell; She is your Mistris and deserues to be so, There being no other worthy of your Seruice: But for my part I haue no interest in her More then a friend. Why should your grace thinke I loue her then so well, to make my loue To her, the quarrell? Duke. Lysander, I did not thinke Th'adst been so base to haue deny'd thy Mistris; But I will further maintaine, thou art thy selfe A Villaine, a base dissembling lustfull one. Lys. Had these words, (Which wound you deeper farre then they doe me, Since they are scandalous) come from another, My sword should first haue an sword, not my tongue; But since you are one to whom I owe my life, Ile keepe another method: First, Ile let you see The wrong you doe me, which if you shall not Straight acknowledge, our swords shall then decide Whether this title be my due or no, And lest you may condemne me for an enemy, As thinking me your debtor, Ile let you see That you my Lord, are as much bound to me, As I to you, though you did saue my life. Duk. Lysander, doe not thinke, You owe me any thing for sauing of your life, The thankes if any was due to Fortune, Who brought me thither; for what I did A peasant might haue done, you being your selfe Almost a Conqueror before I came, Though sure enough for want of bloud to perish, Had I not brought you home, which yet indeed, Was but my duty to helpe a wounded man: But how Lysander, I should stand ingag'd to you For greater obligations, (though this, I grant, Be small) I cannot see. Lys. Tho you should amplifie, as you diminish What you did for me; yet 'twould neuer equall The pulling of my heart out of my brest, For to giue you content. Duke. I cannot vnderstand your Riddle; Yet feare it tends to base submission. Lys. Duke, be not deceiu'd for after the discouery Of that secret which I will tell you, Ile giue you an assurance with my sword, I doe not feare. Duk. What secret is this? Lys. I did but now deny that I did loue Clarinda, But now I call the heauens to witnesse Who must assist me in so iust a quarrell, That I doe loue her equall with my life; And now I will maintaine that I deserue To be better belou'd by her then you. Duk. Come then, may the truest Louer Proue the Victor. Lys. First let me shew you, How I acquit the obligation, I ought you, Clarinda loues me more then I can her, yet though She thus loue me, I out of my gratefulnesse to you, Vsed the best part of my eloquence, To perswade her to marry you; and is not this A secret, and a discharging of the debt I ow'd you. Du. These eares indeed can witnes thou didst perswade her To marrie me, but it was to satisfie Thy owne base ends thy lust and thy ambition, Not out of thy gratitude to me as thou pretendst. Lys. My lust the vestall Virgins that keepe in the holy fire, Haue not more cold desires then I haue. Duke. I in her Fathers Garden late last night, Ouerheard thee tempt that bright Angell Which my soule adores, to acts of lust; And with such mouing reasons, that flesh and blood Could neuer haue resisted, considering That she lou'd thee; but that there was a power That gouerness aboue reason, garded her From thy strong temptation. Lys. My Lord, that curiosity hath vndone you, For I doe call the heauens to witnesse, That what I then spake when I seemed vicious, Was all dissembled; intending you the fruit Of that dissimulation; for when I once Haue made my selfe a peere vnworthy, I thought that she would then haue turn'd The streame of her affection vpon you. Du. Can this be true? Sure feare makes him inuent this; no sure, He cannot bee a Coward, Lysander, Thou hast told me that, if it be true, Doth render thee a perfect man; but not A perfect louer: and trust me if there were A possibility that I could liue without Clarinda, I should be friends with thee; but since she Is the marke at which we both ayme, the one must By the bloud of the other, purchase that happines: And therefore gard your selfe. They fight. Lys. My Lord, the iniustice of your cause, Not Fortune hath disarm'd you, and therfore yeeld. Duke. If feare of death could make me Forget Clarinda, weare the Victors prize Then I perchance might yeeld; but since it cannot, Make vse of your aduantage. Lys. I scorne to gaine a victory so poorely, But to this man that sau'd my life. Du. You are a noble enemy, and haue so won Vpon me by my courtesie, that could you Quit your interest in Clarinda, I should with ioy Share fortunes with you. Lys. We lose time; for since we cannot both Enioy Clarinda, both must not liue. Lys. falls. Du. Fortune, I thank thee, Now I am euen with you, rise, Lys. I owe you for my life; we were but quit before; I would our quarrell were of another nature. Duke. I would it were; but as it is One of vs must lye colde vpon this grasse, Before we part. Fight. Duke fals. Lys. Ah poore Clarinda, this is too sad a witnesse Of thy perfections; would thou wert here yet, That I might take my last farewell. Enter Cleonarda and Mariana. Mar. O deare Madame, what a sad obiect's this! Cleo. Bee not afraid, See if the breath haue quite forsaken that body. Lys. O my best loue Clarinda, Receiue from my dying lips, a dying kisse. Cleo. How's this! Mari. Madame, the breath hath quite forsaken this body, as I thinke: O my deare Brother! Cleo. Is it Lysander then, whom I haue long'd so much to see? I saw him not since he came home from trauaile, And much it grieues me that I see him thus, This is the second time that I haue seene him: Besmeard in blood! Mari. Deare Brother speake, who hath hurt you? Lys. Deare Sister, What blest Angell hath brought you hither? Cleo. This is no fit time for questions Mariana, Let's helpe him to the Lodge, before his losse of bloud O'recome his spirits. Lys. Faire and courteous Lady, pardon me, My sight did faile through my excessiue bleeding, Which made me to mistake. Mari. Brother it is the Princesse. Lys. O Madame, lead me no further then; For you will curse your charity if you preserue me. Cleo. Why Sir? Lys. Because I haue by this vnlucky hand, Robd you of such a Kinsman, as our Soueraigne And your selfe were iustly proud of. Cleo. Who is that? Lys. The Duke, who lyes there as you see. Cleo. It cannot be. Lys. Madame, it is too true. Cleo. Alas my Cozen! Sir, you haue an vnlucky hand indeed; For you haue this day murdered two: Iustice will at your hands require his blood. Mar. O Madame say not so, had you but eu'n now So great a care to saue his life, and are you now So cruell to say that he must perish by the hand Of Iustice, though he should scape these wounds? Would not the Duke haue kild him if he could? Ile pawn my life vpon't, my Brother kild him fairly. Cleo. What shall I doe, if I helpe to preserue him That kild my Kinsman, it is vnnaturall in me, And I besides may lose my Brothers good opinion; And should I be the cause that Mariana's brother perish, I shall lose her for euer; either shee'l dye for griefe, Or else shee'l hate me. Ile doe as I did first intend, My conscience tels me it is the nobler course; Besides, there is something, I know not what it is, Bids me preserue Lysander, the great desire I had To see him, bred from the generall commendations which The world bestowes vpon him, imported somthing. Mari. Deare Brother, what was your quarrell? Cleo. Come Sir, be of good comfort, neither your wounds Nor the cold hand of Iustice, if it be Within my power to helpe it, shall rob Your louing Sister of you, shee is by me So well belou'd. Mar. I want words to expresse how much I loue And honour you. Lys. Madame I would not haue you goe about To preserue mee with your owne danger, I meane the Kings displeasure, besides, I feare Your labour will be fruitless; for it the Lodge Be not hard by, sure I shall bleed to death, Before we can come thither. Cleo. It is but hard by. Lys. Then I may liue to doe you seruice, Rather let me perish before I trouble you. Cleo. You are her Brother, and cannot trouble me, Wee'l lay the body behind yon bush, vntill we Send for it. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius ScÅna prima. Enter Cleonarda and Gerard. Cleo. Can you not finde the Dukes body Say you Gerard? Ger. No where Madame can I finde it, And yet I haue sought it round about the place Where you appointed me; I found the bloudy plot Where it had beene, his horse I found to Tied fast to a tree. Cleo. It is strange, what can become of it, Gerard, Vpon your life keepe secret what you know, And see that none come neere the Lodge. I will send you all prouision necessary, Pretending that Mariana is sicke. Ger. Madame, I feare she will be so indeed, She doth so apprehend her Brothers danger. Cleo. She hath no cause, no wounds of his are mortall; Or if they were, I haue applyed such soueraigne remedies That they shall cure 'em: but who shall be my Surgeon? Loue, I must flye to thee I feare for remedy, I pray thee goe backe, and see that all things be well, And in the morning bring me word how she hath Slept to night. Ger. Madame, there shall bee nothing wanting That lyeth within my power. Exit. Cleo. How carefull am I Of his wounds? me thinkes I would not Haue him dye for all the world: fie Cleonarda, Taken at the first sight with outward beauty, Nor being assur'd first of the inward worth! I wrong my selfe, and him: It was The inward brauery of his mind, which all The Kingdome doth admire, that turn'd my heart, Which vntill now hath beene like adamant To Kings, to melting Ice to him, and not his Outward beauty, that neuer could haue found A passage to my heart, but that the way Was chalked out to it by his Fame: but stay, Whither doe my vaine imaginations carry me? Though Lysander could in worth equall the Gods, Yet it were not fit for me loue him as a husband; He is my Brothers Subiect, shall he be my Master? No. To my old sports agen: to morrow I will bee vp by breake of day, And Reason (as I chase the Stagge) Shall chase these thoughts away. Exit. Enter King, Bernardo, Iacomo, Attendants. King. When rode your Lord abroad? Ber. Early this morning. King. How chances you then did not sooner Bring me this Letter? Ber. I was commanded otherwayes by him. King reads. Royall Sir, adde to the number of your many fauors, the performance of this my last request: What doth hee meane by this? I pray you see Clarinda (who is my wife) possest of what was mine, and withall, pardon him that kils mee; for I will compell him to fight. How's this? Begin not after my death to deny me that which is iust, since in my life time you neuer did see the will of the dead effected, as you desire to haue your Testament perform'd after your death, which I pray the Gods that it may be yet a long life. O what a Character is here deliuer'd, of a pure mind, Which only seems to shew the greatnes of my losse The plainer, his death is not yet certaine, Let me not like a woman spend that time In fruitlesse lamentations which may perchance Afford a remedy, but now it is night: What shall I do? call all the Court, and let them all Disperse themselues, each man a seuerall way; He that brings word the Duke is aliue, Shall haue a thousand pounds: he is gone to fight A Combat with whom I know not; but he that Apprehends the man that kild him, shall haue his land Is there none here that knowes of any falling out Betweene him and some other Lord? speake, Is there none can tell me? Iaco. And if it please your Maiesty, I thinke I haue a guesse. King. Speake then. Iaco. If he bee gone to fight, it is with Young Lysander. King. Let one goe looke for Lysander presently. What grudge was betwixt them? or fell they lately out? Iaco. I will tell your Maiesty in priaute. I am a seruant to the Count Utrante, and was imploy'd by that most noble Duke, (whom I doe feare sleepes now in death) for to solicite his true loue to my young Lady, which I did faithfully performe: but I found all I did was vaine, for shee long time hath beene in loue with young Lysander, which when I knew, I gaue the Duke straight notice; this hath so farre incenst the Duke against Lysander, that they are gone to fight. King. This that thou hast told is certaine true, Else she would neuer haue deny'd to haue married With the Duke, and for thy loue and faithfull seruice to him, Which I beleeue is now no more; for else by this time, He would haue return'd. I will requite thee. Iaco. He was the noblest Gentleman That I shall euer know. He weepes. King. Alas goodman, he weepes. He that can bring me word the Duke is aliue, Redeemes his King from misery. Exeunt. manet Iaco. Iaco. I hope he neuer shall come backe aliue, he knowes I am a villaine, I was too forward in my offers to him, til I had tried his dispositions better. It is kindly done of him and of Lysander yet to spare my paines: there now wants nothing of my wish but that the Duke be kild, and I to find out where Lysander is, then I shall be reueng'd vpon them both, and be possest of that which is my due, (Lysanders land) for so the King hath promis'd. My way to find Lysander if he hath kild the Duke, is for to giue Clarinda a firme beleefe that I doe dearly loue him; for sure if he be liuing, she shall heare of him, and if I finde him, I haue another villanie in my head, which I will put in act, besides my giuing notice of him to the King. My villany shall Vertue be in show, For all shall thinke me honest Iacomo. Exit. Enter Clarinda with a Letter. Clar. reades. I feare the Duke hath notice of our loues; for he hath sent to me to meete him armed, I feare it is to fight, if it be so, and I suruiue the Combate, I will send you word where I abide, if I be kild, I doe coniure you by your vertues, not to to bee vngratefull vnto the Duke, who you see doth not desire to liue, without he may enioy you for his wife. No my Lysander, in that houre when I shall heare That thy faire soule is parted from thy body, I will quickly follow thee. Enter Seruant. Seru. Madame, the King is at the gate, and in a rage, Threatens your Fathers death and yours, they say Lysander Hath kild the Duke. Clar. I fear'd as much, This comes of my dissembling. Enter King, Utrante, and Attendants. Utran. Why is your Maiestie offended with your Vassall, Who as yet neuer so much as in a thought offended you. King. Where is that Inchantresse, which you call Clarinda? Clar. Here Sir, is the vnhappy obiect of your anger. King. I am amaz'd, I neuer till now saw true beauty. Why kneele you Lady? Clar. It is my duty Sir, you are my Soueraigne. King. Rise faire Creatue; came I to chide, and doe I kisse. This is the force of Beauty; who liues That can be offended with so sweet a Creature? I cannot now blame the Duke, for valuing Her so much. I would she were the Daughter Of some neighbouring King, that I without Disparagement might loue her: but I forget My selfe, these are poore humble thoughts, And farre beneath the Maiestie of a King. Lady, I came to chide, I feare you are the cause That I haue lost a Kinsman, a worthy one In all the worlds opinion, excepting yours. Cla. Sir, pardon me you were your selfe the cause By your excessiue loue to him; for that made me Dissemble my affections to Lysander, Fearing to daw your frownes vpon my Father, Should I haue shew'd neglect vnto the Duke. Kin. Who euer was the cause, you shall not feele The punishment; the Duke did truly loue you, Lady, which you shall see here in this Letter Apparantly, may you see your error, And grieue to death for your past folly, In refusing the quintessence of Mankinde: Read it not now, you shall haue time to grieue in, He shewes there in his Letter, that you are his wife, That by that meanes I might be drawne the sooner, To performe his will, which is, that you should Be possest of that which was his, and so you shall If hee be dead. Cla. Sir, I doe vtterly refuse it, all that I desire, Is that your Maiestie will giue me leaue To depart, my griefes doe so oppresse me, That I am sicke at heart. King. When your please Lady. Exit Cla. My Lord how chanc'd it that you neuer told me That your Daughter lou'd Lysander? Utran. Sir, let me perish it I knew it, I am amaz'd to heare it now. Exeunt. Enter Lysander and Mariana. Lys. But Sister, can you thinke it possible, The Princesse should thus loue me. Mar. Brother, I know you see it your selfe, Though you will not take notice of it. Lys. Beliue me Mariana, it doth grieue me much So great a Princesse should bee so vnhappy To loue a man whose heart is not his owne; For he that had a heart at his disposing Could not denie to giue it her. Ma. When she shall know you haue another Mistris, She will call backe her iudgement, and quickly Free her selfe: but Brother, I doe feare You loue her too; you looke and speake to her With more affection then well becomes your faith, Being promis'd to Clarinda. Lys. What would you haue me to doe? Shall I not backe returne those courteous lookes, That she the sauer of my life bestowes vpon me? One knocks without. Mar. Ile see who it is. Exit. Enter Cleonacda. Cleo. How hath your brother slept to night? Mar. Exceeding well Madame; Brother, here is the Princesse. Cleo. Lysander, how doth your wounds? Is your paine lessend? Lys. Madame, I haue no paine But that I feare I neuer shall be able to requite This vndeserued fauor. Cleo. Let not that trouble you; it is to me You owe the debt, and I will find some way To pay my selfe, that shall not make you poorer. Lys. What shall I say, each vertuous deed Rewards it selfe, and that's the coyne with which You must be paid, or else you will be a loser. Cleo. Tell me Lysander, and tell me truely, Haue you a Master? Lys. I dare not lye Madame. I haue one that loues me equally. Cle. Lysander, she hath reason, were I your Mistris, I thinke I should loue you better then my selfe: But tell me Lysander, what was the quarrell, Betwixt the Duke and you. Lys. Madame, I cannot tel you without discouering That which I would gladly keepe conceald; Yet why I should deny you the knowledge of any Secret my heart holds. I cannot see, except I should Be most vngratefull, you being the only cause That I haue now a heart to keep a secret in. Cleo. What was it, speake; I long, yet feare to know it. Lys. The Duke and I were riuals, Clarinda was the marke at which both aym'd. Cleo. Which of you loued she best? Lys. Madame, she loued me best. Wee being brought vp together, Which was her great misfortune; For had she knowne the Duke before me, Her iudgement would haue taught her To loue the worthier, And one indeed that loued her better, At least, with greater passion. Cleo. But did not halfe so wel deserue to belou'd By her as you, since hee did goe about To force loue, or at the least to take from her The loued, that which she most delighted in, her seruant. Lys. Hauing once remou'd me, he hoped she Would accept of him, who would haue made A worthier seruant farre, since he had power To raise her to that glorious height of fortune, Which well would haue become her merits: But on the other side, he knew the meanes Of my Fortune, must needs obscure and darken Her perfections, so that he out of loue To her rather then to himselfe, desir'd To make her his. Cle. He could not chuse but know that if he kild The man belou'd by her she needs must hate him, If she were worthily constant; if not, Then he with danger of his life had purchas'd, Her too dearly; for I should still belieue, If once she changd, she alwayes would become The victors Prize. Lys. Madame, there was some vnlucky mistaking Betwixt vs, or else we had not fought. Cl. Would it had pleas'd heauen you had not fought Or that the Duke had scaped with life, but since Your quarrell was not to be reconcild, though I Doe blush to say so. I am glad t'was he that perisht, For I haue euer wisht you well; I would not haue you thinke I am now in loue With you; yet by my life I cannot say, but I may be Hereafter, tho I know you haue a Mistris, Whose perfections darken mine, giue me those Things to dresse his wounds with. The wounds sure were giuen to me to make me happie, In being toucht by your soft hands, my wounds Can neuer heale, my prayers are against it; Because being well I cannot haue this blessing. Cleo. What a strange alteration doe I feele now! When I touch you, a certaine coldnesse seizeth On my heart and all my blood flies to my face: Sure I do loue you; I ne're yet knew what it was For to dissemble; if I loue I say so, And if I hate, I keepe it not conceald, I will not giue a thought that is base A harbor in my brest; what need I then Conceale my heart? the praise Lysander Which was bestow'd vpon thee had bred in me A great desire to be my owne assurance, Whether thou wert the master of so many Excellencies, as fame bestow'd vpon thee. And now that I doe find they rather doe Come short, then any whit out-goe thy merit, Wonder not that I, though a Princesse, am in loue With thee, for I haue still profest to loue the Richest minde, which is in thee compleat, With the addition of a comly Personage. Lys. I hope your Grace doth not mocke me. Cleo. No by my life, I take delight In looking vpon you. Lys. I cannot thinke you are in earnest, yet I will Answere you, as if you were; should you loue me Thinke you, or would you wish that I should breake My forepast vowes vnto Clarinda. Cle. No, it must be for your worth if I do loue you, And when your proue vnconstant, you are No longer worthy. Lys. If I be constant, What fruit can you receiue from your affection? A barren Loue will ill become So great a Princesse. Cle. Be you still constant, loue your Clarinda stil; For when you cease to be so, I shall hate you; Only respect me as a Sister: for when my reason Shall haue leaue to combate against my passion, It will conuert it to a Sisterly affection. Lys. Madame, I know In that you say you loue me, you doe it only For to make a tryall how strongly I am arm'd By my Clarinda's merits against inconstancie; And I confesse, if it were possible To vndermine my faith, and blow my former Promises into the ayre, your pleasing speech, And those, yet maiesticke glances Of your eyes, were the only Instruments that yet I euer saw to doe it. Cleo. But speake you as you thinke Lysander. Lys. Else may I perish; but mistake me not; For though I could belieue your beauty And merit to be aboue Clarinda's; Which is vnpossible, either that it should be, Or that I should belieue it; yet where my word Is once past, though all the tortures mans wit Can inuent should at one instant inuiron me To torture the minde and body, yet I would not breake my faith. Cle. May I be miserable if ere I perswade you to't; Yet I could wish that you did loue me, And with a little passion, but doe not make shew Of more then you doe truely feele, thinking To please me; for if I find it I shall be angry, I will not hide a thought from you. Mari. But Madame is it possible that (You) should loue him thus? Cleo. I scorne for to dissemble; for who stand I infeare of? were the King my Brother here, Sure I should not deny that I loued Lysander. Mar. Madame, I rather wish My Brother neuer had beene borne Then that the King should know you loue him, Nay, I hope you know it not your selfe; Shall I belieue that your great heart, that euer Yet contemn'd loue, can on a sodaine in foure Or fiue daies knowledge, be struck by my vnworthy Brothers slender merits, and one that must. Be periur'd too, if he should loue you. Cleo. Mariana, take heed how you doe pursue This Subject; for if you doe, I should begin To hate you, are you not asham'd to contradict Your selfe? How oft hath your owne tongue Giuen him the highest attributes of worth? Nay, you haue beene so lauish of his praises, That I haue check'd you for it though I beliu'd Them to bee true, because it comes Somthing too neere the praising of our selues, To praise a Brother, I am my selfe a witnesse Of his valour and his wit, and those are sure The maine supporters to all other vertues, Blush not Lysander to heare thine owne iust praises, Except it be that I doe sully them in the deliuery, Thou gau'st too sad a witnesse of thy valour In ouercomming him, which through this Kingdome was esteem'd the brauest man. Lys. Madam, a brauer man by farre then he Vnder whose sword he fell: Fortune that did enuy His worth, because his mind was fortified Aboue her reach, applyed her selfe that day, Vnto the ruine of his body; and then though Neuer before nor since fought on my side. Cle. When next I come, I will intreat you tell me euery particular Accident through the whole Combate. Lys. Most willingly, for I by that Relation, Shall make apparant the difference betwixt His worth and mine. Exeunt. Enter King, Utrante, and Attondant. King. So many dayes o'repast, and yet no newes Of my deare Cozen, whether he be aliue or dead! Utran. Sir, there is a Hermite, Which hath brought sad newes. King. What of his death, or that he's deadly hurt? Utran. Sir, to your Maiesty he only will relate That which he hath to say, and yet by the sadnesse Of his countenance, know his newes is ill. King. Call him in, Whilst with patience I fore-arme my selfe; Enter Hermite. Speake Father, is the Duke dead? what sad newes Is this you bring? giue me my torment in a word. Her. Your feares are true indeed, the Duke Is dead. Kin. How doe you know. Her. Your Maiesty shall heare, As I was gathering Rootes within the Forrest, The best part of my foode, casting my eye aside, I saw a man lie weltring in his gore, Straight I was strucken with a sodaine feare; But Charitie preuailing aboue feare, I stept to see, if yet the soule had left That comely Mansion, for so indeed it was; Finding some sparks of life remaining, I tooke A cordiall water which I euer carry with me, And by the help of that I brought him to his senses, So that he was able to deliuer these few words. Death I embrace thee willingly, thou being A farre lesse torment, then for to liue And know Clarinda loues another better. May she enioy Lysander, whom now I doe Beleeue is worthy of her: for I that Most vniustly went about to crosse it, Must pay my life downe for my error; Lysander, I forgiue thee my death, and so I hope the King, and with that word the King, He sunke betweene my armes, and neuer Spoke word. Kin. O what a man was this, what marble heart That would not melt it selfe in teares to heare This sad relation? but what became of the body? Her. There Sir begins occasion of new griefe, Whilst I did vainly striue to call backe life, Three barbarous theeues seeking some booty, Came by chance that way, and seeing his garments Rich, they went about to strip him; but hearing Of some noyse within the wood, one of them Did aduise to carry him to their boat, which lay Hard by within a Creeke. I went about To hinder them, and for my paines they did compel Me to carry the body vpon my shoulders, Threatning to kill me if I did refuse; But not content with this, they made me row Them downe the streame, three dayes together, Vntill they came vnto their fellow Pirates. King. What did they with the body? Her. Threw it ouerbord, when they had Rifled it first. King. How chance you came no sooner to tell This newes, though yet too soone, they are so ill? Utran. I see the King did dearly loue him, He weepes. Her. Sir, the current of the water bare vs farther In three dayes, then I was able to returne in ten. King. Giue the poore Hermite something, Though his newes deserue it not, Yet his sufferngs doth: It is an addition to my griefe, that when I parted With him last, I seem'd to be offended with him For his dotage on Clarinda, which he hath Dearely paid for; and yet I cannot blame him, For she is the fairest creature that yet I euer saw. Enter Cleonarda. O Sister, we haue lost our dearest Kinsman, And that which ads vnto my griefe, is, that I cannot Be reueng'd on him that kild him. Cleo. Are you certaine Sir that he is dead, or Who it was that kild him? Ki. Too certaine of them both, It was Lysander that kild him, Whom If I euer get within my power, The sharpest kinde of death that iustice can inflict. Vpon him, he shall feele. Cleo. Say you so brother, hee shall Not come within your power if I can helpe it then; But royall brother, if the Duke had kild Lysander, I know you would haue pardoned him. King. Sister I thinke I should. Cle. With what Iustice then can you pursue Lysanders life, who as the Duke himselfe Informes you in his Letter, sought Onely to maintaine what was his owne; But on the other side, the Duke like an vsurper Without any title would haue taken from him That which he valew'd farre aboue his life His Loue. King. It is not I That pursues Lysanders life, but Iustice; The Law condemnes him to dye, Had it beene but a priuate man, much more Being so neare a kin to me, Cle. There is no Law; but doth allow vs to defend Our selues, Lysander did no more, for who can denie He was compeld, honor compeld him, The Duke compeld him and loue (which cannot be By noble minds resisted did aboue all compel him, Then all the fault Lysander did commit in my Opinion, is that hee was too slow, needing Compulsion in so iust a cause, and therefore Sir If you should apprehend Lysander, though by The letter of the Law his life is forfeit; Yet remember that mercy is the greatest atribute Belonging to those powrs, whose substitute you are. King. Sister, you often haue had occasion To shew your Charity, in being a Suiter to mee For the liues of those that had offended; Yet vntill now you neuer beg'd my mercy vnto any. Cleo. Sir, you neuer had occasion giuen you Till now to whet the sword of Iustice by your owne Particular reuenge, that it might cut the deeper, And being not intressed, your mercy of it selfe Did blunt the edge, and needed not my intercession. King. I do coniure you by my loue, To speake no more of this vnpleasing subiect; For if I get Lysander once within my power, I will sacrifice his heart-bloud to the Ghost Of my deceased Cozen. Enter Clarinda. Vtran. You know it is bootlesse, The King is so incenst, in begging mercy For Lysander, you may proue cruell to your selfe, And vnto me your Father. Clar. O Sir, how ill you doe requite Lysander; His loue to you was the onely cause That puld these miseries vpon him; For had not he so dearly tenderd you, Fearing to draw on you the Kings displeasure, We had long since bin married, then this vnlucky Combat had not bin, nor I had need of that Which now I am to beg: Mercy, great Sir. Kin. Why, know you where Lysander is? Clar. O no, but I doe feare he cannot escape Your hands. King. Why Lady, Can you hope that if hee were taken I would pardon him: hath he not kild the man That in the world was nearest to my heart? I cannot grant this; rise, and by mine honor Aske or command what is within my power (But this) and it shall be perform'd. Cla. Sir, all the suite Ile make, since this cannot be granted, is That in the selfe same houre that my Lysander Is to suffer; I who haue beene the fountaine From whence these bloudy streames haue issu'd, May be permitted to shew Lysander the darke Yet pleasing way to the Elizian Fields; For though we could not here, yet there we shall Enioy each other. Cleo. Lysander, shouldst thou proue false to her, Though I my selfe were cause of thy inconstancie; Yet I should hate thee. King. I hope you will better consider Of the generall losse the world shall sustaine, In losing such a Iewell as your selfe: Sister, I will leaue you to aduise her better, And pray you vse her with your best respect, Her worth and beauty doth deserue it; My Lord Vtrante, haue you in your daughters name Taken possession of all that was the Dukes, As I commanded? Utran. My Lord, I haue the full possession; But she doth vtterly refuse them. King. I know my Sister will aduise Her better. Exe. manet Clar. &amp; Cleo. Cla. The Princesse is the fairest Creature That yet mine eyes euer beheld, why does she looke So stedfastly vpon me? Gracious Madame, What see you in this worthlesse frame, That so attracts your eyes. Cleo. I see Clarinda, In each particular of the whole frame, Which thou term'st worthlesse, an excesse of beauty, Which in another Lady might breed enuy; But by my life I take delight to looke on thee. Cla. And Madame, may I perish, If ere mine eyes yet met an obiect, wherein I tooke halfe that delight that I doe now In looking vpon you; were I a man And could frame to my selfe a Mistris by my wishes Hauing the wide world to choose in, for each Particular to make vp the whole. I should beleeue It were a fruitlesse labour, if I went farther Then your selfe thus fram'd. Cleo. Clarinda, as I am Sister to a King, I see I must partake of their misfortunes, Which is to be grossly flatter'd: but it may be You giue me this faire language by instinct; For I haue pleasing newes to tell you, If that you had come to Court, I thought To haue sent for you, which vnto you I know appeares most strange, for till this houre I neuer had the happinesse to see you. Clar. Madame, it does indeed. Cleo. It will appeare more strange, When you shall know the cause for which I would haue sent for you. Cla. Deare Lady, what is it for? Cleo. I would haue sent for you, To know what you would haue giuen willingly, To one that would vndertake to saue Lysanders life. Clar. I cannot name you a particular, But all that I haue, or can giue. Cleo. I meane not goods or money, But could you bee content if it were A woman that could doe this, To quit your interest in Lysander, And giue him leaue to marry her? Clar. If it should come to that, I know I sooner should be willing, Then I should, draw him to giue his consent. Cleo. It is nearer it then you belieue, I know a Lady that hath sau'd his life already. Cla. How, beg'd his pardon of the King! And vpon those conditions hath he giuen consent? Cleo. He hath not yet; but when he knowes Your minde I thinke he will. Clar. Is she a hansome Lady, and well borne? Cleo. Not very hansome; but her birth is great, In both she equals me, and in affection to Lysander, you. Clar. Madame I doe beseech you Leaue this too harsh discourse: for it hardly Can be true, since there is no Lady In this Kingdome, that euer I saw That equals you in beauty, yet The imagination that it may be so, Doth from mine eyes draw teares, and chases From my heart the vsuall heate. Cleo. Weepe not Clarinda, I cannot hold thee Longer in suspence. I am the Lady that I meane, And therefore chase away thy feare. Clar. I neuer saw true cause of feare till now, The tale you told appeares much likelier truth, Now, that you are the Lady, then it did before; For you haue in you that full excellency. That would make Gods forsweare themselues, If they had made an oath, should you propose Your selfe as the reward of that their periury: Shall I belieue then that Lysanders frailtie, Can resist such an assault, if you be so resolu'd; Besides, what lady hath the power to beg Lysanders life, at your incensed brothers hands; But onely you that are his Sister: Goe poore forsaken maide, and melt thyselfe Away in teares, and doe not liue to be an eye-sore To this noble Lady, nor to vpbraid Lysander With his falshood. Cleo. Stay sweet Clarinda, And for as many teares as I haue made thee shed From those faire eyes, so oft Ile kisse the Crystall Fountaines from whence they flowed; belieue me, Dearest maide, though I doe loue Lysander, Yet I would not wrong thee for a world, Of which to giue the more assurance, Thou shalt see, and speake with thy Lysander, For thou art onely worthy of him; He is now at Gerards Lodge within the Forrest, None knowes of it but Gerard, and his owne Sister Mariana, how I brought him thither wounded, Ile take another time to tell you: when you would See him you must goe disguis'd: farewell Clarinda, Be confident I loue you dearely. I will stay No longer lest it should breed suspition. Exit. Clar. Madame, your humble seruant. How strange a tale is this! yet sure it's true, Why should the Princesse say so else? But can it be the Princesse loues Lysander? Can it be otherwise, if she doe know him? If it be true, sure Lysander will not neglect So great a blessing: hence Iealousie, the canker Of true loue, that dost in time consume that Which did giue thee beeing; why should I wrong Lysander, to mistrust his faith, till I haue Better cause, I must to him, and in disguise, Which how to get my selfe I know not, Enter Iacomo. I must trust some body, and who so fit As honest Iacomo, who I know loues Lysander. Come hither honest Iacomo. Iaco. Madame. Clar. I know thou lou'st me, And wilt doe any thing that I command thee. Iaco. Madame, I hope you make no doubt of it. Clar. No thou shalt see I doe not doubt; For I will make thee priuie to a secret, That torture should not drawn from me. Iaco. If it be that that I suspect, torture shall Hardly make me to conceale it. Clar. What saith thou Iacomo? Iaco. Madame, I say although I should be rackt, Yet what you tell me shall be still conceal'd. Clar. I know it should; come trusty Iacomo, Ile tell thee all the Story as wee goe. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus ScÅna prima. Enter Clarinda in disguise, Iacomo. Clar. How an I bound to thee for this disguise, I thinke my Father if I had met him Could not haue knowne me, how farre is it Yet to the Lodge? Iaco. It is not aboue a Mile; but are you sure He is there? Clar. I would not else haue come so far a foote Nor put on this disguise. Iaco. Madame, if you be weary, here is a faire Coole shade, where you may rest your selfe a while. Clar. Though I be faint and weary; Yet I will not stay, the great desire I haue To see Lysander, doth support my weaknesse. Iaco. But Madame, I am weary, and I haue No such strong desire as loue to carry me. Clar. For shame say not so, can you being a man And vs'd to walke, be weary in so short a iourney? Iaco. Madame. you must refresh me with a kisse I cannot walke else. Clar. How Iacomo? Iaco. Why, doth not the paines that I haue taken. Deserue a greater recompence then that? Clar. I doe confesse The paines that thou hast taken, and I intend thee a reward equall to it, But it amazes me to heare thee aske, That which would trouble me to giue; And yet to thee that shoul'st receiue it, Doe no good at all. Iaco. If it will trouble you to giue it, then let Me take a kisse. Clar. How strangely art thou transported, With a fond desire! Iaco. You will not kisse me then? Clar. I prethee be not angry Iacomo, Ile giue thee that which is better; Here take this Iewell; yet let me tell thee, The Duke would not thus boldly haue demanded What thou didst aske. Iaco. He was a foole then, And did not know his owne aduantage, Which you shall find I doe, you that Denyed me now a kisse, shall giue me that Which you perchance the first night Would haue denyed your husband. Cla. I do not like this, whats that honest Iacomo? Iaco. Your Maidenhead. Clar. How! I know thou dost but speake this For to excuse thy selfe from going; sit still, Ile find the way my selfe. Iaco. Are you so crafty, stay and heare me. Clar. What sayst thou honest Iacomo? Iaco. Not too honest neither, I know you are wise, and there fore Ile vse no perswasions, else, but onely letting of you see the danger. Clar. O I feare this villaine. Iaco. Lysander you told me was at the Lodge, and there the King shall find him, except you will redeeme him from that danger, by the losse of your Virginity; I know you would bee well content to kisse me now, but now it will not serue. Clar. Will honest Iacomo then proue a villaine? Iaco. Who would not proue a villaine for so sweet a recompence: How I doe glory in this purchase of my wit, the Duke striuing to gaine the happinesse, I shall haue offer'd me, paid downe his life fort; besides, he went about the ceremonial way of Marriage; but I shall meet my happinesse a neerer way, which will be an addition to the pleasure. Come, are you resolu'd? Clar. Why villaine, dost thou prize Lysanders life Aboue mine honor? Iaco. If for a word, for honor is no more, You can indure to see Lysander suffer cruell death, It seemes you loue him little, doe as you will; Make hast vnto the Lodge, you know the way well The King may chance be there before you, As I will handle the businesse. Clar. Stay Iacomo, canst thou be such a villaine As thou dost seeme; I doe not thinke Thou art in earnest. Iaco. All torments that man did euer feele, Light vpon me, if I doe not performe What I say. Clar. Then may they all light on thee; For thou, deseru'st them all. Iaco. Stay Lady. Clar. Dost thou relent? I knew thou didst it but to trye mee. Iaco. It is true indeed, I did so. Clar. I thought thou still wert honest. Iaco. Be not deceiu'd: I tried indeed if you would giue consent, because the pleasure would haue beene the greater so; but since I haue you once agen within my power, I will inioy you whether you will or no. Clar. Canst thou beleeue, the heauens that haue the power, To strike thee dead, will suffer such a wicked Act? Iaco. It is in vaine to striue or crye, There is none to helpe you. Clar. If the feare of Heauen Cannot deterre thee from this villanie; Yet tremble at the punishments my Father And Lysander will inflict vpon thee; For doe not thinke there's any place that's so remote, But they will find thee out. Iaco. Tush, they shall still belieue mee to be Honest Iacomo; Yet I will let the King know where Lysander is. Clar. Why villaine, dost thou thinke I will not Discouer thee? Iaco. Yes, I doe know you would; but I will take a course with your Ladiship for telling when I haue done with you. Clar. I know thou wilt no be so mercifull to kill me. Iaco. Yes, feare it not, rather then I will be hang'd for a short minutes pleasure. Clar. Then kill me first, before thou dost dishonour me. Iaco. It may bee you'l bee of another mind anon, and wish to liue. The trees stand here too thin, Ile carry you into a thicker place. Clar. Helpe, Murder: is there no power that will transforme me to a tree, and saue my honor? Iaco. Yes, Ile transforme you, you may beare fruit too, if you will be willing. Exeunt. Enter Duke disguis'd. Duke. How happy are those men that lead a Country life, And in the nature of each seuerall creature, View the great God of Natures power, who can finde Nothing in the whole frame, but either for the composition Or the existence, is worth our admiration! Within Clarinda. Murder, helpe, helpe, Murder! Duke. It was a womans voyce sure. Exit. Enter Iacomo. Iaco. Slaue that I was, that did not stop her mouth, as well as bind her hands; it was well the bushes were so thicke; for had he once got sight of me, he would haue coold my heate: since I haue mist this pleasure, my reuenge shall be the greater; Ile to the King and tell him what I know concerning Lysander, which will ingraft me in his fauour, and for Clarinda's accusall, let mee alone. Exit. Enter Duke and Clarinda. Duke. Tell me prety Boy, why did the villaine bind thee? I thought thou hadst beene a woman, when I heard thee cry: How pale thou lookst of a sodaine; be not afraid, He dare not come againe to hurt thee. Clar. My hard harted Master I feare will come agen. Duke. He had a hard heart indeed, that could hurt thee; It is the pretiest boy that yet I ere did see, And yet me thinkes I haue seene a face like this before: Where wert thou borne sweet child? Clar. Sir, I was borne in Naples. Duk. Sure I haue seene a face like thine, Why dost thou blush? Clar. Where Sir, doe you thinke you haue seene A face like mine? Duke. Not in this Countrey, for I am here a stranger. Clar. Then Sir, you doe not know the way to Gerards Lodge. Duke. Wouldst thou goe thither? I thinke I doe. Clar. Yes Sir, if I did know the way. Duk. Ile bring thee thither if I can. Clar. Sir, I doe owe you much, And haue no other payment but my thankes: But might I be so happie as to meet you In the City, I haue some friends that would Perchance doe you some pleasure. Du. If thou wilt stay with me here in the Forrest, At a little house where I doe lie, to morrow I will bring thee to the City. Clar. You are the most Courteous man that ere I met with: I am so weary that it is not possible For me to reach the City, and at the Lodge, Lysander must not stay, nor must I flye With him; I am not yet prouided of money, For our flight. Foole that I was to trust That villaine Iacomo, alas, I did not know Him then to be a villaine. Sir, if you'l bring Me to the Lodge, I will onely speake one word With one that is there, and go along with you. Duke. Come then. Clar. He takes me for a Boy, and so long There's no danger. Exeunt. Enter Cleonarda drest like a Nymph, Huntsmen. Cleo. Lay on the Hounds where the young Deere went in, These old fat Deere make no sport at all. Hunts. If it please your Grace he is not a Stag. Cleo. No matter Sir, I am the Mistris of the field this day, My Brother not being here, and I will Haue it so: the sorer that the Chase is My being absent will the lesse be markt. Hornes. Enter Mariana and Lysander. Mar. Brother, me thinkes now your wounds being well. It were good to quit this Countrey for a while: For it is impossible but by some meanes or other, If you stay heare, you will be discouered. Lys. Sister, it is my intent; but I without The Princesse leaue, who hath preseru'd my life, Will certainly resolue of nothing. Mar. The time hath beene, that you without Clarinda's leaue would haue done nothing. Lys. And is so still, For may I perish when I proue false To my Clarinda; yet should I say I doe not Loue the Princesse, and with some passion too, I should but lye. See where she comes Enter Cleonarda and Gerard. And with the splendor of her heauenly eyes Amazeth my weake senses; not Dian's selfe Lookt halfe so louely when she woo'd The pale-fac'd Boy Endymion; Nor Pallas when she stood Competitor With the two Goddesses to gaine the golden apple, Appear'd with halfe that Maiestie That she doth thus attir'd: hold faith, Thou neuer wert in such a danger. Cleo. Lysander, I am glad to see you thus Recouer'd: I glory in my cure. Lys. Madame, I am so well, That I desire your license to depart, There's danger surely in my being here Both to your selfe and me. Cleo. Lysander, I know you doe but iest, For should I giue you leaue, I know You would not goe. Lys. Madam, it's best we part, should I stay here And dayly looke vpon those Sun-bright eyes, And heare your charming tongue, my faith I feare Would proue like wax, and melt, Clarinda's picture Would be soone defac'd, and I should then deserue The hate of all the world. Cleo. Lysander, do not feare it, You shall this day See faire Clarinda, whose merits will arme you, Too strongly to misdoubt a change. Lys. Did your Grace see her then? Cleo. Yes Lysander. I saw Clarinda, Whose perfections haue compeld the heauens, In Iustice, to giue her the most deseruing man aliue To be her seruant. Lys. Madame, its true, She hath indeed the most deseruing man That then did liue, the Duke, giuen to her For a seruant: but when the heauens saw That she did refuse him whom they knew Was onely worthy of her, they left her then To her vnhappie choice, in me, in which She cannot faile to be miserable, And that they might torment her with The knowledge of her error, they tooke from The earth vnto themselues whom she refused, Making him equall vnto one of them. Cleo. Lysander, I wil giue you leaue to praise the Duke, Because it still tends to your greater praise, Since you did ouercome him both by your valor, And your other merits: for faire Clarinda Whose iudgement is compleat, esteeme you For the worthier, Lysander neuer was there man So blest as you are, in a Master, for it is As impossible to equall her in loue, As in perfection; for though she know that her Perfections farre transcendeth mine, yet her Excesse of loue did make her iealous, When as I told her I had sau'd your life; And now, but I to shew her that I loued You only as a brother, did tell her where You were, and much I wonder that she Is not come. Lys. It may be she doth wisely feare that there Are some that watch each step she maketh, Hoping by that to find mee out; for now It is no newes that she doth loue me, When I am at Florence Ile send her word, For so I promis'd her in a Letter when I went To fight, if that I escap'd with life. Cleo. You shall not goe to Florence to day, Yet doe so, and bee not sad to goe; For when my Brothers passion is once ouer, And that he shall consider the iustnesse Of the Dukes request, in his last Letter, I meane your pardon, hee cannot sure Be any longer cruell. Lys. Why Madame, Did he write a Letter to the King, In which he beg'd my pardon? Cleo. Yes Lysander, he did; And the last word that ere hee spake, was To that purpose, the letter I can shew you, I neuer till this day could get it from my Brother. Lysander reads to himselfe. Lys. He in this Letter doth expresse himselfe To be so neere the composition of the Gods, So fild with all perfections, me thinkes it's strange They shold not build him altars: yet my infortunate Hand did rob the world of this precious Iewell; For which offence my heart shall drop in iustice As many bloudy teares, as now my womanish teares Doe drops of brinish water. Cleo. Worthy Lysander, Each pearle like drop fals from thy manly eyes, May expiate a greater sinne then that thou didst Commit in thy intention: I cannot chuse But kisse thee for this noble sorrow. Say Mariana, Haue I done ill to kisse your Brother? Mar. Madame, it were in me presumption To consure any of your actions. Cleo. Lysander, Must you goe to day? Sure you doe not loue me as a Sister, else You would not part so soone. Lysan. By this kisse, which I belieue shall be The last that I euer shall be blest with, Did not my faith oblige me otherwayes, I should loue you equall with Clarinda, Nay had I knowne you first, I should Haue lou'd you better; but as it is I know you are so noble in your selfe, That you wold hate me if I should proue inconstant Cleo. It is true, it were a basenesse for which My iudgement would condemne you as vnworthy To be belou'd; but yet I thinke my passion Would make me change that saying of louing Of the Treason; yet hating of the Traitor; For I should hate the Treason, and yet I feare me Too much loue the Traitor. Lys. It were impossible that you should loue A periur'd man. Cleo. I doe but feare it; I know your worth will neuer put it to the tryall. Lys. Deare Princesse, Gerard, to whom I am much bound, Hath horses ready for me, so that there is Nothing wanting but your leaue to make My iourney happie. Cleo. Which I vnwillingly doe grant you, yet Pray the heauens to make your iourney prosperous. O Mariana, would I had neuer seene thy brother, Or hauing seene him, that I might enioy him For my Husband: but I doe ill to wish anothers Right; that happinesse belongs to faire Clarinda's Merits onely. Lys. Go Gerard, get the horses ready. Ex. Ger. Cleo. Lysander, let me heare from you, And if you thinke it no way preiudiciall To your faith. I pray you weare this fauor For my sake. Lys. Madame, most willingly, And thinke it for the greatest honor that ere Was done me. Within Crye, round beset the house. Cleo. What noyse is that Mariana? Mari. Madame, Ile goe see. O Madame we are vndone, it is the King, Who threatens to hang vp Gerard for concealing Of my Brother. Lys. Deare Madame, hide your selfe, What will the King your Brother say, If he doe finde you here? Cleo. I will Lesander flye from his anger now, That I may haue more power hereafter To doe thee seruice; what will you doe Lysander? It is no matter what becomes of me, So that you be safe from the Kings anger. Enter King, Iacomo, Attendants, Gerard bound, Guard. Iaco. Sir, set the house round, lest he should scape At some backe dore. King. Be that thy charge, take halfe the Guard, Ile search The house my selfe: Where is this bloody Traytor? Lys. Sir, heares a bloody-handed, though not a bloudy Minded man, that doth not yet deserue the title Of a Traitor. I know it's me you looke for. King. Bloudy villaine, it's thou indeed, Lay hands on him. Lys. Keepe off, and heare me speake first, And then I will deliuer vp my sword. King. What wouldst thou say. Lys. I see poore Gerard bound, whom I Compel'd to conceale me. Kin. How couldst thou compell him? Lys. Royall Sir, with patience hear me: When I by the assistance of Fortune, not my valour; (Yet I did nothing basely) had kild that noble Duke I was my selfe sore wounded, so that I could not Flye out of your territories, and well I knew Into what house so ere I came, though they At first might pitty me, not knowing What I had done; yet when they once should know That I had kild the Duke, they then I knew Would streight discouer me, rather to gaine reward, Or else to saue themselues from future danger, Which to preuent. I thought my safest course was For to compell Gerard, whom well I knew Liu'd farre remote from company, to sweare Not to discouer I was in his house, Or else I threatned straight to kill him, Hoping that rather then he would forsweare Himselfe, he would conceale me, wherein I was No whit deceiu'd. Ger. If please your Maiestie, He came into my house before I was aware, With his sword drawne, and setting of it To my brest, threatening if I would not sweare For to conceale him, to kill me instantly. I (not knowing what he had done) Swore all that he would haue me. Cleo. A God transformd into a humane shape Could doe or say no more then he hath done. King. But when thou knew'st that he had Kild the Duke, how durst thou then Conceale him? Lys. I then began to fright him with strange Examples of the cruell punishments that periur'd Men had felt, and aw'd his conscience that way. King. So thou dost mine Lysander; For I haue made a vow, after that I had got thee Once within my power, the Sun shall not Twice set, til I had with a sacrifice of thy heart bloud Appeas'd my Kinsmans Ghost. I dare not Be forsworne, away with him to prison, And Gerard. Exeunt Lys. Ger. and Guard. Cleo. It is then no time for to conceale my selfe. O cruell Brother! you haue in that rash oath Mutder'd all vertue that Mans fraile nature Is capable to receiue. King. I am amaz'd, Tell me deare Sister, what make you here, I hope you know not of his villany. Cleo. O doe not call a demi-god a villaine, Though Fortune made his valiant arme The instrument to rob you of a worthy Kinsman. King. Sister, you speake with passion, as if You lou'd him. Cleo. Yes Brother, I doe loue him, With all my heart I loue him, which I will Manifest more then in words, If you be cruell. King. Sister, as you respect my fauour, And your owne faire Name, blemish not so Your royall blood by louing of a murderous Ingratefull villaine. Cleo. O that you were no Brother to me, Nor my King, that I might satisfie mine Anger by a braue reuenge. By louing of a murderous ingratefull villaine. Cleo. O that you were no Brother to me, Nor my King, that I might satisfie mine anger By a braue reuenge; by my life, I would haue shed His heart bloud with my Iauelin, that should Haue spoke this but your selfe, but as it is, Ile let you see your error, you might as well Call him a murderer that being assaulted By a barbarous thiefe, kil'd him that would Haue rob'd him; for so Lysander did, and Whereas you call him ingrate, there you doe Erre, the Duke being his debtor; and so Indeed is all the world, for he hath left them Such a Story in his actions, that hee that can But read and imitate them to the life, Shall in another iuster age, be made a God, And worshipt for his vertues. King. Sister, did you but see how ill These praises doe become you; (for you indeed Are drunke with affection) you would leaue Them me. I know when you recouer by the helpe Of reason, you'l hate your selfe, and wish that all Y'aue spoke or done this day were but a dreame. Cleo. O neuer, neuer; poore Clarinda, What will become of thee when thou shalt heare This killing Newes! Exeunt. Enter Clarinda and the Duke. Duk. It grieues my heart that I haue brought thee wrong, Clar. Sir, must we lie here in the wood all night. Duke. I feare there is no other remedie, Clar. O my Lysander thou art lost I feare For euer, and that same villaine Iacomo is cause of all. There is some comfort yet, I see a light, sure it's some house. Duke. For Charities sake open the Dore. He knocks. Enter Hermit. Lord Sir, where haue you beene? Duke. Mercy vpon vs, how are we mistaken! This is the old mans house where I haue beene Still since I came into the Forrest. Cla. Pray heauen he did not misse his way a purpose. Duk. Good Father, if you haue any meate Fetch me some for this sweet youth, I met him In the Forrest, and would haue shewed him The way to Gerards Lodge, but lost my selfe, And wandred vp and downe till now. Her. Here, here's some meate; I was my selfe at Gerards Lodge, and saw those There whom you would little thinke. Duke. Who were there? Her. The King and his faire Sister, Lysander bound as a Prisoner, for killing Of the Duke. Cla. O my Lysander's lost. fals. Duke. Looke to the Boy, he swoones; speake Child, what dost thou ayle? Cla. That same who is Lysander, now a prisoner, (And must die) was the only cause I would So faine haue gone to Gerards Lodge, For that villaine who had bound me, I knew Would tell the King that Lysander was there, And I would faine haue giuen him warning, That he might haue fled, because hee is Thy Kinsman. Her. Be not sad Boy for that, I heard that Princesse sweare if the King Put to death Lysander, that she will not out-liue Him; and he too well loues his Sister, To lose her so. Cla. How! Is the Princesse so in loue with him? Her. Indeed they say she is. Duke. Come, and eat your meate, tyou shall Goe to bed, I know you are weary. Clar. Sir, I cannot eate, I had rather sleepe, Her. Come then, Ile shew thee to a Bed. Clar. No Sir, Ile lie vpon the Rushes, I neuer vse To lie with any body, and I am sure Here in this house there are not many beds. Her. Come, thou shalt lie alone; There are two beds, we two will lie together. Clar. Please Sir to leaue me here, Ile go to bed. No childe, Ile helpe thee. Clar. If he should see my breasts, I am vndone; I will keepe on my doublet. Her. Goe to bed sweet childe, wee'l leaue thee. Exeunt.</field>

The King hath sworne to haue his head off ere Sun-set. Ias. The Kingdome will be poore in such a losse, For he leaues none behind him-worth his equall. Ber. I, but is't not strange the King should grace That villaine Iacomo that did betray him? Ias. His extreame loue vnto the Duke makes him Loue Iacomo, who doth professe that he did not Discouer Lysander in hope of gaine; but onely Out of loue to the Dukes memory. Ber. At one o'th clocke he is to suffer, let vs be there betimes and get a place neere the Scaffold to heare his last words. Exe. Enter Utrante in blacke. Utran. How blacke and sorrowfull this day lookes! This day, in which Lysander is to suffer; Noble Lysander, to whom my Child and I Are so much bound; and yet hee is the cause Of both our ruines; or rather I am cause: It was my ambition to haue a Duke My Sonne in Law: no, it was my Clarinda's Beauty bred all this mischiefe, and it was The Heauens that gaue Beauty to her: Why did they then not blesse that gift in her, But turne it to her curse? Peace wretched man And argue not with those high powers, But wait their pleasure, and pray for their assistance, Who can yet change this ScÅne of blood into A ScÅne of ioy, and back returne thee thy Clarinda. Enter a Seruant. Ser. If't please your Lordship, my young Lady Is return'd and gone agen. Vtran. How! Ser. She hath beene in the house this houre as the maids tell me, hath chang'd her cloaths, and's newly stolne out at the backgate, and gon toward Lysanders prison; two of my fellowes are gone after her, and I came back to tell your Lordship. Exit. Enter Cleonarda and Mariana. Cleo. And do's the Kings cruel resolution hold still? Mar. O Madam yes, my poore Brother must dye to day. Cleo. And wilt not thou dye with him: speake Mariana. Mar. Madame, I could wish that I might not out-liue him. Cle. Why sayst thou thou couldst wish, hast thou not hands? Or dost thou want a knife? if so, yet there's many wayes to die. Mar. Madame, how strangely doe you talke. Cleo. Why, wouldst thou wish to liue, After the vntimely death of such a Brother? Ma. Madame, we must not goe vntill the Gods do call vs, Yet I bylieue it is the better place. Cleo. The better place, assure thy selfe of that, they would Not else thus early call thither the best of Men. I will follow Him where ere he goes to see. Enter Iacomo. Iac. Madame the King desires your company. Cleo. Villaine, had he none else to send but thee That didst betray Lysander, hence from my sight. Exeunt. Enter Duke and Hermit. Her. What did you with the Boy? Duke. I left him at the Count Utrante's house: He told me he dwelt there. Her. At what houre say they must Lysander suffer? Duke. At on of the clock, faile not to be there, And get neere the Scaffold. Her. You need not bid me. Exeunt. Flourish. Enter King, Cleonarda, Iacomo, Mariana, Attendants, one of them in Habit of a Countreman. King. Sister, beleeue me, you haue told me such particular Arguments of Lysanders worth, that I doe pitty His misfortunes much, and haue quite lost my anger; Yet Iustice must be satisfied. Cleo. Sir, the offence that he committed, was but against The Law, although he rob'd you of a Subiect: You are aboue the Law, and may remit it; A King should in points of life and death, Be like the Chancery, in other cases, and helpe By mercy against the cruell letter of the Law, As the Chancery doth by conscience. Especially when your owne conscience tels you That he was forc'd against his will to fight. Kin. Sister, it were an example too dangerous To pardon him that kild my next of blood: It might encourage some to strike my selfe; And therfore it is in vaine to plead for mercy. Enter Utrante and Clarinda. Vtran. O daughter, let not your passionate loue Vnto Lysander, make you accuse good Iacomo. Cla. O sir, you are cozen'd, he is a Diuell incarnate, Iustice. Iustice great Sir. King. Lady, I thought your plea would haue beene mercy, And not Iustice. Clar. Sir, I haue lost all hope of mercy; but Iustice I hope you will grant me against that villaine Iacomo. Iaco. Now haue at me; but I haue fore-arm'd the King with such a tale, that and mine owne impudence, which neuer faild me, shall well enough defend me. Kin. Arise faire Clarinda, and by my Crowne, Bring your sufficient proofe, you shall haue Iustice; But wel I know you hate good Iacomo, because he did Discouer where your Lysander was. Cla. Would I had bit my tongue out of my head, When I gaue it power to tell you where Lysander was. Iaco. Your maiestie may marke by this how true the rest is that she hath to say. Madame, then you would seeme as if I had deceiu'd your trust, and that you had to mee discouerd where Lysander was; make me not so odious, I neuer was a traitor, had you to me discouer'd it, wild horses should haue torne mee in a thousand pieces, ere I would haue confest; no, this same countrey fellow one day being within the Lodge saw him, and so discouered it to me. Cla. Though thou deny'st this with a brazen brow, Yet thou canst not denie thou wouldst haue rauisht me, When I did trust thee to goe along with me, I being disguis'd then, where I to thee discouer'd When Lysander was; and more thou threatendst (If I did not giue consent to thy base lust) To murder mee, when thou hadst done, Because I should not tell. Iaco. Madame, I did not thinke that loue to any man could ere haue turnd that excellent wit of yours so ill away, as thus vniustly to accuse a man that is innocent, and one that honors you. Enter Duke and Hermite. Utran. Sir, I doe grieue, My Daughters, loue vnto Lysander, should Moue her for to seeke a most vniust reuenge Against good Iacomo, whose like for honestie I know not in this Kingdome of his quality. Clar. Sir, here's a witnesse, that will confirme What I haue said for truth. Duke. What gentle Lady? Cla. Sir, 'twas I that you rescu'd yesterday, From a villaine that would haue rauisht me. Duke. Why Lady, were you in such danger? Iac. Marke you Sir, she knowes of no such thing. Cla. I was the Boy you found in the wood, Whom this villaine would then haue rauisht, Which then I told you was my master. Du. I thought no boy could haue so sweet a face, Indeed Sir, tis most true, I found this Lady bound, And that same villaine as I thinke; for I had but A glimpse of him in the bushes, his feare making Him flie as soone as euer he saw me. Clar. I beseech your Maiestie let him be hang'd, For on my honor what I doe affirme is truth. King. Your affirmation is to me a hundred Witnesses, yet it were in me iniustice to deny The combat 'gainst this gentleman that doth accuse Him on your behalfe, if Iacomo desire it. Duke. Belieue it Sir, he that will do such villanies, Will neuer dare to fight, Sir send him to the Galleyes, If he will nor fight, it shewes his guilt. Iaco. Hell take you all, I dare not fight might I haue all the world giuen. Ile rather to the Galleys. I shall get out there with some tricke or other, and then Ile poyson twenty of you, Ile not discouer what I am that will but shew me more. King. Let him that rescu'd Clarinda haue the land That Iacomo should haue had, for discouering where Lysander was: call forth the prisoner, and proceed to execution. Enter Lysander, Executioner, Guard. Lys. Weepe not Clarinda, you may liue happily You and the Princesse may together make A kinde of Marriage, each one strongly Flattering themselues, the other is Lysander; For each of you's Lysanders better part: Pardon Clarinda that I borrow from That streame of loue a part to pay the Princesse, Which euer yet ran constantly to the Ocean Of thy perfection only, for now a gratefulnesse To her, makes some of it run in another current; For which I know thou being wise, canst neuer Loue me lesse, knowing that I haue loue enough For both, since I can marry neither. Cla. Lysander, doe not thinke I grudge that part of Loue You pay the Princesse, her merits farre transcending mine, Besides, you owe her for preseruing of your life, And I haue beene the only cause, that you must lose it; But Ile beare you company, and in that pay the debt I owe you. King. Why stayes the Prisoner? Lys. Onely to take A parting kisse; then when you please, I am prepar'd. King. What meane you Sister, will yon make apparant To the world your folly? Cleo. Sir, doe not hinder me; For if I may not here speake with him, We will conuerse in death sooner then you belieue; Lysander, thou art going to thy lasting home, And in thee all vertuous men must suffer, They being but branches, thou the root of all perfection: Who will be Curteous, Valiant, since these are causes Of thy death; for thou vnto the world didst manifest In thy last action with the Duke, that thou wert Really possest of these: but I, in summing vp thy worth, Doe but increase my griefe; since I must part with thee, The rich vnhappy owner; for they haue only seru'd To reuiue thee, and those that lou'd thee for them, Poore Clarinda, I from my owne conceptions Could weepe, to thinke vpon the torment thou wilt feele, When as the Axe shall seuer from thee loues Worthy person, thy comely head, worthy, Most worthy, in that it was the Cabinet appointed By the Gods to keepe their richest Iewellin, His minde, which is indeede an Index, In which iudicious men may read as in a Booke, The whole contents of all their excellence. King. Sister, for shame doe not thus wrong Your selfe and me, by throwing such high praises On a man, condemn'd by Law. Lysander, Prepare thy selfe to die, and take no notice of her Idle praises, which if they could to any mortall Man be due, they were to him, for whom Thou now must suffer. Lys. Sir, I doe confesse it and am ready to receiue Your doome. Cleo. I need not to a mind so fortifide as thine is Giue any Antidotes to arme thee against death. Lys. All the encouragement that I will desire Shall bee a kisse of your faire hand. Cleo. Lysander, thou knowst my soule embraceth thee, These are the first teares that ere fell from mine eyes, Although a woman, which I am pleased with, Since it well expresses this is the greatest griefe That yet I euer felt. Lys. This kisse Clarinda is thy due, thou art The neerest to my heart in Iustice. Clarin. swoones. King. Looke to Clarinda, carry her home. Cleo. I thought she would haue out-gon me; but now Mine shall be the glory: who would liue in a world That's bankrupt of all vertue? Lys. kneeles. Exec. I pray Sir forgiue me your death. Lys. Friend, doe thine office; I forgiue thee. Duke. Hold villaine. King. How darest thou hinder the sword of Iustice, From lightning where it is design'd. Duke. Sir, if you execute this Lord, you are a Tyrant. King. Why Sir, will it bee tyranny in mee To execute the Law? the fellow's mad, Lay hands on him. Duke. It is a cruell Law that doth condemne the innocent. King. Why, is he innocent? Duke. Let me dye for't if I doe not proue He did not kill the Duke. Kin. And by my Crowne, since thou dost interpose thy selfe Betwixt the sword of Iustice and the Object, It shall cut through thy life too with Lysanders, If thou dost faile to proue what thou affirmest. Lys. I doe beseech your Maiesty, Let not this franticke man, (for so he seemes to be) Out of his loue to me, ruine himselfe: I doe confesse againe it was this vnlucky hand, And no other, that kild the Duke. Duke. I call the heauens to witnesse, it was I That was the cause he bled that day, And well he did deserue it, for thinking So vniustly to rob thee of Clarinda, Who only dost deserue her. King. Carry the fellow hence; Doe I sit here to heare a mad man talke? Duke. Call me not fellow, I am as good A Gentleman, as was the Duke your Cozen, And were he now aliue hee would acknowledge it. Kin. Away with him to Prison, Ile haue him Strangely punisht for this presumption. Away with him. Her. Sir vpon my credit, And men of my Profession should not lye, he's both In Birth and worth equall vnto the Duke. Kin. Though I doe reuerence your Profession, Yet I see no cause to belieue you, For in this Kingdome there is none so worthy. Her. Sir, yes; euery way as worthy, And one your Maiestie doth loue so well, That if he aske you, I know you will pardon Lord Lysander for his sake. King. Sure all the world's infected, One that I loued so well and equall to the Duke In Birth; how canst thou proue this? Her. Thus I can proue it, Discouer Duke. To your great ioy and all the Kingdomes. Kin. I am amaz'd; art thou a Coniurer, And from the quiet graue hath raised The beloued person of my Kinsman to delude me? For thou wert he that said thou foundst his body. Duke. Ghosts doe not vse to pay their duty to The liuing, Sir, feele my hand, I am your Seruant. Kin. O my deare Cozen, can this be true! Duke. Sir, I will make all plaine: but first I must Relieue the worthiest of men, noble Lysander, Send for Clarinda, and tell her this glad newes: Madame, let me kisse your faire hands, I euer honourd you, but now I doe adore That high rais'd mind of yours, that feares not To professe your loue to vertue, though in distresse. King. Deare Cozen, I do long to know by what meanes you were preseru'd. Duke. This reuerend man that did the pious act, Can best resolue it you. Kin. 'Twas he that brought first word that he Had found your body, by which we were resolued That you were dead, he told his tale so punctually. Duk. When I began to bee pa'st danger of my Wounds, I fram'd that tale about the thieues, Intending to conceale my selfe, and so to make Triall of your loue to me, and of Clarinda's Loue vnto Lysander, both which I finde Not to be equal'd. Kin. Good Father tell vs how you found him Wounded, and how you did preserue him. Her. Sir, what I to'd you Concerning the finding of him wounded, All that was true, and how I did recouer him By a soueraigne water; but that he after Dyed within my armes, you see is false And yet he spoke those words that I deliuer'd As his dying speech, he hauing then indeed No hope of life: but heauen so order'd it. That he recouer'd by my skill in Surgery, In which Art I shall not boast to say That I am equall with the most skilfull of this age, Which I thinke well appeares, since I haue cured Him in so short a time; yet I must attribute His sodaine curing to a soueraigne balme, That an Egyptian gaue mee, from which countrey I late came. Kin. Holy man, expect from me a great reward; For you haue backe to me restor'd the comfort Of my life; but where haue you since liued, Or how came you by this disguise? Enter Clarinda. Duke. I liu'd with him still in a little Cottage, And he did fom the City fetch me disguises: Diuine Clarinda, pardon me, I was your bedfellow, And did not know my owne happinesse then; If I had knowne you, I would haue done Iust as I did; I see you are amazd, it was I That in disguise rescued you, and sau'd your honor, When that villaine would haue rauisht you; In which I was most happy; for I shall now present You, so much the richer gift to your Lysander. Here braue Lysander, let me deliuer vp Into thine armes the Iewell of thy life; And in that make some part of satisfaction, For the wrong I did hee, in compelling thee To fight for that which was thine owne before In iustice. Lys. My Lord, the seruice of my life hereafter Shall make manifest how much I honor you, And with what ioy I doe receiue your guift. Cle. I would haue giuen my life to haue redeem'd Lysanders; where is the ioy then that I should feele For his deliuerance. O I haue found the cause That doth suppresse it; it's enuy that Clarinda's Happier then my selfe: why should I enuy that Which is her due, both by his vowes and her Owne merit. Lys. How sad the Princesse lookes? I wonder Shee doth not speake to me. Cle. Heart, though thou burst, the world shal not See I grieue or enuye Lysander and Clarinda, May you be happie in your loues, which I can neuer be. Lys. Her noble heart will burst with griefe, Would I had dyed, or rather that I had two hearts, By death I had beene free, this way I am A debtor to the Princesse, and that ingratitude Torments me worse then death. King. Call for the sacred Priest, and let vs change That which we thought should haue been a ScÅne Of blood, into a ScÅne of ioy, by ioyning Two despairing Louers hands together. Du. O what a happy mans Lysander at this instant Compard with what he was halfe an houre since! Imagination cannot reach it; but on the other side How farre am I falne from that happinesse That I possest when faire Clarinda said That she would marry me within a month. Enter Priest. Kin. Come reuerent Sir, performe an office Acceptable to the Gods: Sister, take you Lysanders Hand, and Cozen you Clarinda's. Cleo. O what a cruell office hath my brother put vpon me. Duke. I would this taske were past, Vertue I see thou art a cruell Mistris. Clar. I in my soule grieue for the Duke, His manly eyes shed teares to performe this Office; I would to heauen he were my Brother, Or that Lysander were; the consideration Of his worth and infinite affection, Which hath appeard in all his actions, Hath gaind much vpon me. Priest. Will you Lysander take Clarinda for Your Wife, forsaking all other till the hand of death Arrest the one of you? Her. Say no Lysander. Lys. Reuerend Sir, why? Her. Because the Marriage is not lawfull. Duke. Can you proue it vnlawfull? You sau'd my Life, but I shall valew that no benefit, Compar'd with this, if you can proue Lysander and Clarinda cannot marry; Ile make you more then you can wish to be. Her. Lysander, did not your Father When you last parted with him, giue you A little Cabinet, in which he bid you looke When you should marry, on his blessing Not before, not at your death. Lys. It is true, he did so, but I Was so distracted betwixt ioy and griefe, That I had quite forgot it. Her. Send for it with all haste. Kin. What can this Cabinet produce to stop The Marriage. Cleo. I cannot plead desert, Thou God of Loue, because I haue so short a while Beene subiect to thy Lawes; but well thou knowst If thou oblige me to become thy subiect, By giuing me Lysander, that I shall More extoll thy power then any Subiect That thou hast: but on the contrary, If thou dost not assist mee, I will returne againe Vnto Diana, thy vtter enemy, and in her seruice Spend the loath'd remnant of my life. Enter with a Cabinet, Paper in it. Kin. The Cabinet is come. Duk. I make no doubt, If't be within thy power, thou God of Loue, But thou wilt grant to me thy truest Subiect The wishes of my heart; but I doe feare a greater Power then thine, doth ouer-rule the destinies. Her. Here Sir, read that paper; there you shall Finde, what you doe little thinke. King reads. Lysander, I doe giue you leaue to marry whom you doe thinke fit, because I know you are able to make a worthy Choyce, onely Clarinda you cannot marry, for she is your Sister. Lys. How! my Sister! Duke. Loue thou hast heard my prayer, though I were Ignorant, and knew not what to aske. Kin. I am amaz'd, sure this is Witch-craft. Duke. Sir, I beseech you proue this to be true. Her. My Lord, if you will beg a Pardon from the King, It is for a fault, that was neuer proued against me; I then will make all things so plaine, that no man shall deny it. Enter Messenger. Mes. And please your Maiesty, Iacomo is proued to be The Count Orsinio's Brother. Her. My Lord, let him be brought, heele helpe to the clearing of the discourse I am to make. Duke. Sir, I must beg a pardon for the sauer of my life. Kin. What hath he done? I pardon him, be't what it wil. Her. Then Sir, behold a banisht man. puls off his beard. Kin. The Count Orsinio! Lys. My Father! your blessing Sir. Utran. My deare friend! welcome. Enter Iacomo. Duke. Sir, Ile not bid you welcome, Till you make it plaine, it can be no Marriage. Iaco. My Brother! Her. O thou wicked villaine! art thou aliue yet? I might haue knowne thee by thy villanies, Through thy disguises. Du. Good my Lord proceed vnto your discouery. Her. My second wife being barraine, I had No hope of Issue Male; for I had Mariana There by my first and it did grieue my Soule To thinke that villaine there should be my heyres For he dayly practiz'd mischiefe before vnheard of. It was not long before my wife obserued That the chiefe cause of all my discontent Grew from her barrennesse, and she being fearefull That my affection might decline as did my hope Of issue, thought of a strange and most vnwonted Meanes, to make her selfe appeare a happy mother. My friends Wife here, the Count Utrante Finding her selfe to bee with Childe; my Wife, By helpe of Art did seeme so too: but strange To see how gold will worke! for by a somme of Money, my Wife did worke the Mid-wiues, Nurse, And Doctor, to cozen the true Mother of her Child When ere she should be brought to bed. Kin. How was that possible? Her. Most easie Sir, as they did handle it, The Child was borne, and prou'd a Boy, As my Wife wisht; for had it beene a Girle, It could not then haue eas'd me of my griefe, My land being tied vpon the Heyres. Male. Duke. Good Sir, proceed. Her. The Nurse was by the Doctor straight Commanded to carry into the next roome the child, Alleaging that it was most necessary, The Mother, after so much labour should Sleepe, which the Childs crying might hinder: Within a short space comes in the Mid-wife Pittifully weeping telling the Mother That the Child could hardly liue; but straight The Nurse she entring the Chamber cried out Alas the Child is dead; the wofull Mother Falling in a swoone, had almost made That sorrow reall for her, which then but Counterfeited for the Child. Duke. The Child then was not dead. Her. No Sir, the crafty Nurse Had by a back-dore conuaid it out o'th house By helpe of another Nurse that she had there For the purpose: hauing recouer'd The Mother out of her trance, the poore Lady Desir'd to see her late comfort, though now Her only cause of sorrow, the dead Child: But the Doctor vtterly denyed that, Alleaging that would but increase her sorrow, Which might impeach her health: My friend here was not then at home, And who durst contradict the Doctor In such a case. Kin. Was there No seruants in the house? Did none of them Aske for the Childe? Her. Sir, to preuent that, They had before prouided a piece of wood Shapt like a Childe, and about that they put A winding sheete. King. But what excuse then made they For their haste in dressing of it For the graue, that was not then Scarce cold. Her. For that they told the seruants The Childe being deform'd they made such haste To hide it from the neighbours; that they Might not be witnesses of their Ladies shame, In bringing such a Monster into the world. The Nurse the same night came, and told my Wife What they had done, and she aduising with Her agents, the next night after seem'd To fall in labour, and by the helpe of those Her creatures made perfect by their former practise, She cozen'd me and the world, by making vs Belieue, that she had truly brought me forth a son. I did a thousand times kisse my young heyre, And by my carefull education and his owne Braue naturall parts, hee's growne to be What now you find, Lysander, for he's the same. King. But how came you to know Lysander was not your naturall sonne, and these Particulars? Her. My Wife Sir, Being vpon her death-bed, she found her conscience Troubled with this deceit, and could not Depart in peace, till she had freely told me Of this strange Story; I still conceal'd it Out of my iust anger against my wicked Brother; Besides that great affection which I bare Lysander, Continued still, and is now so great, That if your Maiestie by your Prerogatiue Will but confirme it. I doe adopt him for my Heire. King. I shall. Iaco. Thus Sir, was I defeated of my right; My Lord the Duke there by his power, though I did proue this in the open Court, by witnesse of the Nurse and Midwife; yet he made mee to be banisht as an iniurer of others. Duke. I doe confesse the wrong I did thee Though ignorant, and for to make thee satisfaction, I will be a suitor to the King in thy behalfe: Sir, now vpon my knowledge I dare affirme That Lysander is sonne vnto the Count Utrante. Lys. It was nature in me, that made me so much Loue the Count Utrante: you blessing Sir. Clarin. It do's not grieue mee that you are My Brother. Lys. And for my part, I cannot adde To my owne happinesse, if I might haue my wishes, Now that yon are my Sister; for I did euer loue you As a Sister rather then as a Mistris. Duke. Diuine Clarinda, I cannot claime your promise till a moneth be past, There is some part of it to come, but I hope You will not strictly stand vpon the time. Clar. My Lord, I should too much wrong my selfe, though I did not Loue you, in deferring of so great a blessing: But the large testimony that you haue giuen Both of your worth and affection to me, Haue turn'd that great affection in an instant, That I bare Lysander, as you could wish it, Vpon you; nay to say truth, I euer lou'd you, Though not so well as hee, and held your worth As great. Duke. Deare Clarinda, giue me not a surfet. Lys. I feare the King will nere consent. whisper. Duke. But good Sir, What made you desire me to beg your pardon. Or what made you conceale your selfe so long? Her. My Lord, Ile tell you; Your Lordship may remember, for it is not Fiue yeares since that this my Friend, the Count Utrante and my selfe, were both suspected For poysoning of your Vncle, because we were His profest Enemies; especially my selfe, Which made me flye, though I were innocent, For it was knowne to many, that the villain Kild him for's owne particular reuenge. Yet my wicked Brother there, perswaded the fellow At his death to say, that we had set him on And got another rascall to witnesse with him That it was true; my friend, not hauing so great Enemies, did stay to iustifie himselfe, And for his paines was laid in prison, and kept there For his lands, till you got him releast, And yet he was neuer brought vnto his tryall; I, ere I left this Country, did leaue this Cabinet With my sonne, or rather yours, and withall The charge of looking in it when he should Be married. After many a weary step abroad, I came home to my Countrey, and in disguise Haue liu'd here in the Forrest, and saw my friends Full often, although they knew not mee; And hauing this occasion of doing your Lordship Seruice, I thought it would be a sure meanes To get my pardon; especially when things Were growne vnto the extreamest poynt Of danger, I knew a timely remedy would be Most welcome then of all, and that made me Conceale my selfe so long. Lys., Cleo. We are resolu'd. King. My Lord, I freely pardon you, for I belieue It was indeed a lye, inuented by your wicked Brother, whom I doe giue you power to punish As you thinke good. Her. My Lord, I then desire He may be kept a prisoner all his life; For should he haue his liberty, I know He would doe mischiefe that we should all Repent of. Iaco. Brother, thou art wise, Thou shouldst haue beene the first that should Haue felt mine anger. King. Away with him. Duk. I dare not speake for thee thou art so great A Villaine. Exe. Guard with Iacomo. King. Come, let vs set forwards to the Temple, And pray the Gods to shower a blessing Tpon this Couple;âWhat meanes my Sister? Lysan. and Cleon. set swords to their brests. Cleo. Thus Sir, Lysander and my selfe haue made a solemne Contract, and with our bloods wee'l seale it, Either to goe thus to the Temple to be married, Or to the graue. King. How Sister! Cleo. What is it Sir, in your opinion, makes Lysander vnworthy of me. King. His blood compard with yours, is base. Cleo. But Sir, his mind's heroicke, And who will compare the seruant with the Master? The Body is no more vnto the Minde. King. What would you marry with a Subiect? Cleo. Who would not Marry with a Subiect that is a King of Vertues, Rather then with a King that's gouern'd By his Vices? Duke. Sir, you know the greatnesse of her Spirit; If you will haue her to liue, you must Consent. Cleo. Brother, you stand to vs Instead of destinie; for you haue in your power Our threed of Life. Say, will you spin vs out A happy threed, that we may liue to serue you, Or will you cut it short? Duke. O be not cruell to your only Sister; What's all the out ward glory, if you rob The mind of that which it delights in? I know that your intention is to make Her happy, doe not mistake the way; Her mind is not taken with the glorious title Of a King; for if it had, shee might haue made Her choyce, since all the neigbouring Kings Admire her: No Sir, shee aymes at that Which made men Kings at first, Wisdome, And Valour, and should she search the world Shee cannot finde a man where they Doe meete so fully, as in braue Lysander O Sir, then be not cruell, thinking to be Carefull of your Sister. King. Shee's cruell to her selfe, And rather let her perish by her rash hand, Then so dishonour mee, by marrying with A Subiect. Cleo. Farewell then Cruell Brother: Lysander, let us part To meete agen for euer; Ile goe first, Because my Brother shall not thinke of sauing me When you are dead. Lys. No Madame, Let me shew you the way, and when I feele The paine, Ile tell you if it be too great For you to suffer. King. Hold: take him Sister, And be happy in him: I loue thee more Then euer, because I see, thy minde is onely Fixt on true Worth without additions. I learn'd of Count Orsinio to bring things, To the extreamest poynt, so to encrease The ioy: it had beene a sinne to part Those Bodies, whose very Soules seeme to bee Ioynd together. Cleo. Brother, may I perish, When I forget this benefit, or cease to pay To you my Lord, my thankes for pleading so Lysanders Cause and mine. Kin. Great Loue this day hath shewne his mighty power Without the helpe of Fortune. In an houre He hath relieu'd from death and from despaire Foure of his truest Subiects, and made faire This day that was o're clouded, let vs praise His power that in a minute so can raise From misery to an excesse of Ioy, And in an instant that content destroy: He hath to vs beene iust this day as well as kinde. Rewarding vertuous Loue let none then call him blinde. Exeunt omnes.</field>
