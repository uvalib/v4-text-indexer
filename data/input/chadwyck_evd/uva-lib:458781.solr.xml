      <field name="fulltext">Enter Queene Aegiale, Janthe her maid two counselers. Aegiale. Leaue me a while my Lordes and waite for me, At the blacke fountayne, by Osiris groue, Ile walke alone to holy Irus caue, Talking a little while with him and then returne. Exeunt omnes. Manet Aegiale. Ianthe begone. Now Irus Let thy mindes eternall eye, Extend the vertue of it past the Sunne. Ah my Cleanthes where art thou become, But since I saued thy guiltlesse life from death, And turnd it onely into banishment, Forgiue me loue, mee pittie comfort mee. Enter Irus the Begger with Pego. Pego. Maister. Irus. Pego- Pego. VVipe your eyes and you had them. Jrus. VVhy Pego. Pego. The Queene is here to see your blindnes. Irus. Her Maiestie is wel come, Heauens preserue, And send her highnes an immortall rayne. Ægi. Thankes reuerent Irus for thy gentle prayer, Dismisse thy man a while and I will lead thee, For I haue waightie secretes to impart. Pego. Would I were blind that she might lead mee. Exit. Ægi. Irus thy skill to tell the driftes of fate, Our fortunes and thinges hid from sensuall eyes, Hath sent mee to thee for aduertisment. VVhere Duke Cleanthes liues that was exilde, This kingdome for attempting mee with loue, And offering stayne to Ægipts royall bed. Irus. I hope your maiestie will pardon mee, If Conscience make me vtter what I thinke, Of that hye loue affayres twixt him and you. Ægi. I will sweete Jrus being well assurd, That whatsoeuer thy sharpe wisdomes sees, In my sad frailtie thou willt haue regard, To my estate and name and keepe it close- Jrus. Of that your highnes may be well assurde, Then I am bound madam to tell you this, That you your selfe did seeke Cleanthes loue, And to aspire it, made away his Dutches, VVhich he well knowing and affecting her, Deare as his life denyed to satisfie, That kindenesse offered twixt your selfe and him. Therefore did you in rage informe the Duke, He sought your loue, and so he banisht him. Ægi. To true it is graue Irus thou hast tould, But for my loues sake which not Gods can rule, Strike me no more of that wound yet too greene, But onely tell me where Cleanthes is, That I may follow him in some disguise, And make him recompence for all his wrong. Irus Cleanthes is about this Cittie off, VVith whom your maiestie shall meete ere long: And speake with him, if you will vse such meanes, As you may vse for his discouery. Ægi. VVhat shall I vse then what is in my power, I will not vse for his discouery, Ile bind the winges of loue vnto myne armes, And like a Eagle prying for her pray, VVill ouerlooke the earthes round face for him, VVere this sufficient. Or I will Moorelike learne to swimme and diue. Into the bottome of the Sea for him. Least beeing the sonne of Aegypt and now set, Thetis in rage with loue would rauish him. VVere this sufficient. Irus. But Maddam this must be the likliest meane To seeke him out, and haue him at your will Let his true picture through your land be sent. Opposing great rewardes to him that findes him, And threaten death to them that succour him, So Ile assure your grace shall meete with him eare long. Aegi Happie and blest be Irus for his skill He sweetely plantes in my contentious mind, For which most reuerent and religious man, I giue this Iewell to thee richly worth. A kentall or an hundreth waight of gold, Bestow it as thou list on some good worke, For well I know thou nothing doost reserue, Of all thy riches men bestow on thee, But wouldst thou leaue this place and poore mans life, The count of Aegipt should imbrace thy feete, And Toples honors be bestowed on thee, Irus. I thanke your highnes for thus raysing mee, But in this barrennesse I am most renound. For wisdome and the sight of heauenly thinges, Shines not so cleare as eathlye vanities. Aegi. Most rich is Irus in his pouertie Oh that to finde his skill my crowne were lost. None but poore Irus can of riches boast, Now my Cleanthes I will straight aduance Thy louely pictures on each monument About the Cittie and within the land. Proposing twise fiue thousand Crownes to him, That findes him to be tendered by my handes, And a kind kisse at my imperiall lipes, To him that succours him, Ile threaten death, But he that doth not threaten him shall die, For who is worthy, life will see him want. To all his pictures when they be disperst, VVill I continuall pilgrimages make, As to the saintes and Idols I adore, VVhere I will offer sighes, and vowes, and teares. And sacrifice a hecatombe of beast, On seuerall alters built where they are plast, By them shal Isis stature gently stand, And Ile pretend my Iealous rites to her But my Cleanthes shall the obiect bee, And I will kneele and pray to none but he. Exit. Irus. See Earth and Heauen where her Cleanthes is, I am Cleanthes and blind Irus too, And more then these, as you shall soone perceaue, Yet but a shepheardes sonne at Memphis borne, And I will tell you how I got that name, My Father was a fortune teller and from him I learnt his art. And knowing to grow great, was to grow riche, Such mony as I got by palmestrie, I put to vse and by that meanes became To take the shape of Leon. by which name, I am well knowne a wealthie Vsurer, And more then this I am two noble men, Count Hermes is another of my names, And Duke Cleanthes whom the Queene so loues. For till the time that I may claime the crowne, I meane to spend my tyme in sportes of loue, VVhich in the sequell you shal playnely see, And Ioy I hope in this my pollicie. Enter Pego, Elimine, Samaphis, and Martia with there men Menippus, Pollidor, and Druso. Pego. Oh maister heere comes the three wenches now strike it deade for a fortune. Irus. These are the nymphes of Alexandria. So called because there beauties are so rare. VVith two of them at once am I in loue Deepely and Equally the third of them, My silly brother heere asmuch affectes, VVhom I haue made the Burgomaister of this rich towne, VVith the great wealth, I haue bestowed on him, All three are maides kept passing warilye, Yet lately beeing at their Fathers house as I was Leon the rich vserer I fell in loue with them, and there my brother too, This fitly chaunceth that they haue liberty, To visit me alone: now will I tell their fortunes so, As may make way to both their loues at once, The one as I am Leon the rich vserer, The other as I am the mad brayne Count, And do the best too, for my brothers loue, Pe. Thanks good maister brother, but what are they that Talke with themso long are they wooers trow, I do not like it, would they would come neare. Irus. O those are three seruantes that attend on them, Let them alone, let them talke a while. Eli. Tell vs Menippus, Druso, and Polydor, VVhy all our parentes gaue you three such charge, To waite on vs and ouer see vs still, VVhat do they feare, thinke you that we would do. Mem. There feare is least you should accompanie, Such as loue wanton talke, and dalliance, Eli. VVhy what is wanton talke. Mem. To tell you that were to offend our selues, And those that haue forbidden you should heare it. Sa. VVhy what is dalliance sayes my seruant then, Dru. You must not know because you must not dally. Sa. How say you by that, well do you keepe it from vs, as much as you can, weele desire it neuerlesse I can tell ye, Mar. Lord what straite keepers of poore maides are you, You are so chast you are the worse agayne: Eli. Pray you good seruantes will you do vs the seruice, To leaue vs alone a while. Mem. VVe are commaunded not to be from you, And therefore to leane you alone, Were to wrong the trust your parentes put in vs. Ma. I cry you mercy sir, yet do not stand all on the Trust our parentes puts in you, but put vs in a litell to I pray. Sa. Trust vs good seruantes by our selues a while. Dru. Lets my mastrs and you say the woord, Theyle but to Irus for to know theire fortunes, And hees a holy man all Egypt knowes. Mem. Stay not to long, then mistris and content, Eli. Thats my good seruant we will straight returne. Po. And you mistris. Mar. And I trustie seruant. Po. Faith then Ile venter my charge among the rest. Exeunt Mar. A mightie venture you shall be cronicled in Abrahams asses, Catalog of cockscombes for your resolution. Eli. Now the great foole take them all who could haue, Pickt out three such liuelesse puppies, Neuer to venter on their mistrisses. Sa. One may see by them it is not meete choise men should haue offices, Mar. A prettie morrall work it in the samplar of your hart, Eli. But are we by our selues. Mar. I thinke so vnlesse you haue alone in your belly. Eli. Not I God knowes I neuer camewhere they grew yet, Since we are alone lets talke a little merrily, Mee thinkes I long to know what wanton talke and dalliance is Sa. Ile lay my life tis that my mother vses when she and others, Do beginne to talke and that she sayes to me mayde, Get ye hence fall to your needle: what a mayd and Idle. Ma. A mayd and Idle why maydes must be Idle but not an other thing. Sa. then do not name it for I feare tis naught. For yesterday I hard Menippus as he was talking, VVith my mothers maide and I stoode harkning at the chamber doore, Sayde that, with that woord a mayd was got with childe. Eli How with the very woord. Sa. I meane with that the woord seemes to expresse. Mar. Nay if you be so fine you will not name it now, VVe are all alone, you are much too nice. Eli. VVhy let her chuse, let vs two name it, Mar. Do then Elimine. Eli Nay doe you Martia. Mar. VVhy woman I dare. Eli. Do then I warrant thee. Mar. Ile warrant my selfe if I list, but come let it alone, Let vs to Irus for our fortunes. Eli. God saue graue Irus. Irus. VVelcome beautious Nymphes. Sa. How know you Irus we are beautifull and cannot see. Irus. Homer was blinde yet could he best discerne, The shapes of euery thing and so may I, Eli. Indeede wee heare your skill can beautifie, Beautie it selfe, and teach dames how to decke, Their heades and bodies fittest to their formes, To their complexions and their countenances. Ir. So can I beateuous Nimphes, and make all eyes, Sparkle with loue fire from your excellence. Eli. How thinke you we are tyred to tempte mens lookes, Beeing thus Nimphlike is it not too strange, Irus. It is the better so it doth become. But that I may disclose to you your fortunes Tell me first Pego their true faces formes. Pe. Mary sir this that speakes to you has a face thinne like vnto water grewell, but yet it would do your hart good if you could see it Irus. I know and see it better then thy selfe, The blaze whereof doth turne me to a fyre. Burning mine Intrailes with a strong desire. Eli. VVhy turnst thou from vs Irus tell my fortune. Irus. I wonder at the glorie it presentes, To my soules health that sees vppon your heade, A corronet, and at your gratious feete, Nobles and princes in their highest state, VVhich state shal crowne your fortune eare you die, And eare the hart of Heauen, the glorious sunne, Shall quench his rosiat fires within the west. You shall a husband haue noble and rich. Sa. Happie Elimine, oh that I myght too. Eli. Thankes for this newes good Jrus but disclose, The meanes to this, if it be possible. Irus. VVhen you come home ascend your Fathers tower If you see a man come walking by, And looking vp to you, descend, And Issue, for you shall haue leaue, And if he woe, you chuse him from the world, Though he seeme humorous and want an eye, VVearing a veluet patch vpon the same, Chuse him your husband, and be blest in him, Eli. Ile doe as thou aduisest gentle Irus, And prouing this Ile loue thee whilst I liue. Sa. My fortune now sweete Irus. Irus. VVhat face hath this Nimph Pego. Pego. Mary sir a face made in forme like the ace of hartes. Irus. And well compard for she commaundes all hartes, Equall in beautie with that other Nimph, And equally she burnes my hart with loue, Sa. Say, say sweete Irus what my fortune is, Thou turnst from me, as when thou didest admire. The happie fortune of Elimine. Jrus. So might I well, admiring yours no lesse. Then when the light cround monarch of the heauens Shal quench his fire within the Oceans brest Rise you and to your fathers garden hie, There in an arbour doe a banquet ser, And if there come a man that of him selfe, Sits downe and bids you welcome to your feast, Accept him for he is the rihcest man, That Alexandria or Ægypt hath, And soone possessing him with all his wealth, In little tyme you shall be rid of him, Making your seconde choyse mongst mightie kinges. Sa. Blest be thy lippes sweete Irus, and that light, That guides thy bosome with such deepe fore sight, Sleepe shall not make a closet for these eyes, All this succeeding night for hast to rise. Ma.

VVhat face hath this Nimph Pego. Pego. Oh maister what face hath she not, if I should beg a face I would haue her face. Irus. But is it round, and hath it neare a blemmish, A mouth to wide a looke too impudent. Pego. Oh mayster tis without all these, and without al crie. Irus. Round faces and thinne skinde are hapieest still. And vnto you fayre Nimph. Shall fortune be exceeding gratious too, VVhen the next morning therefore you shal rise. Put in your bosome rosemary tune and rue. And presently stand at your fathers doore, He that shall come offering kindenesse there, And craue for fauour those same holsome hearbes, bestowe them on him, and if meeting him, He keepe the nuptiall Rosemary and time, And tread the bitter rue beneath his feete, Chuse him your husband and be blest in him. Ma. I wil sweete Jrus nothing greeues me now, But that Elimine this nyght shall haue, Her happie husband, and I stay till morning. Eli. Nought greeues me Irus but that we are maides.

Exeunt. Enter Aegiale, Herald, Euribates, Clearchus with a picture. Ægi. Aduance that picture on this fatall spring, And Herald speake vttering the kinges edict. He. Ptolomie the most sacred king of Ægypt first of that name, desiring peace and amitie with his neighbour princes hath caused this picture of Cleanthes to be set vp in all places, proposing great rewardes to him that findes him, and threatning death to him that sucours him. Ægi. VVhich Gods forbid, and put it in his minde. Not so to stomacke his vniust exile. That he conuert the furie of his arme, Agaynst so saken Ægypt taking part, VVith those foure neighbour kinges that threaten him, And haue beseiged his most Imperiall towne. Clear. Now may it please your hignesse to leaue your discontented passions, and take this mornings pride to hunt the Bore. Ianthe. We haue attended on our grace thus farre, Out of the Cittie beeing glad to heare, Your highnesse had abandoned discontent. And now will bend your selfe to meriment, Aegi. So will I louely Ianthe come then. Let vs goe call foorth sacred Isis Nimphes, To helpe vs keepe the game in cealesse vew, That to the busie brightnesse of his eyes. VVe may so interuent his shiftes to scape. That giddie with his turning he may fall, Slayne with our beauties more then swordes or dartes. Exit with a sownd of Horns. Enter Leon with his sworde. Leon. Now am I Leon The rich vsurer and here according To the kinges commaund and mine owne promise. I haue brought my swoord and fix it by the statue, She set vp, by this am I knowne to be Cleanthes, VVhose sodayne sight I now will take vpon mee, And cause the nobles to pursue my shadowe, As for my substance they shall neuer finde, Till I my selfe, do bring my selfe to light. Cleanthes, Cleanthes, stop Cleanthes, see Cleanthes, Pursue Cleanthes, follow Cleanthes. Enter three Lordes with swordes drawne. 1 Lo. where is Cleanthes, Leon sawest thou him. Le. I why should I els haue thus cried out on him, I saw him euen now heere did he fix his sworde And not for dastard feare or cowardize, For know all Ægypt ringes of his renowne. But fearing for his noble seruice done, To be rewarded with ingratitude, he fled From hence fearing to be pursued, 2 Lord. Come on my Lordes then lets follow him And pursue him to the death. Exeunt. Leon. Oh do not hurt him gentle Citizens, See how they flye from him whom they pursue. I am Cleanthes, and whilest I am heare, In vayne they follow for to finde him out, But here comes my loue Bright Psamathis, VVhom I loue Equally with fayre Elimine, See here she comes as I apoynted her. Enter Samathis and her maydes with a banquet. Iaquine. But I fayth mistris is this for a woer. Sa. Not for a woer onely my Jaquine, But a quicke speeder girle for this is he, That all my fortune runnes vpon I tell thee, Ia. O daintie mistris send for some more banquet. Sa. No my fine wench this and my selfe is well. And let him not sit downe like the oxe and the asse, But giue God thanks for we are worthie of it though we saite. Ia. Mistris tis true. And that he may be good, I coniure him by these three things a crosse, Now let him come he shalbe good I warrant ye, Leon. Nay do not flye me gentle Samathis. Sa. Pardon me sir for if I see a man, I shall so blush still that I warrant you, I could make white wine claret with my lookes, Le. But do not blush and flie an old mans sight. Sa. From whom if not from old men should I flie Le. From young men rather that can swift pursue, And then it is some credit to out goe them, Yet though my yeeres would haue me old I am not, But haue the gentle Ierke of youth in mee, As fresh as he that hath a maidens chinne. Thus can I bend the stiffnes of my limbes, Thus can I turne and leape and hoyse my gate, Thus can I lift my loue as light as ayre, Now say my Samathis am I old or young. Sa. I would haue my loue neyther old nor young But in the middle Iust betweene them both. Le. Fit am I then for matchlesse Samathis. And will be bould to sit. For batchlers Must not be shamefast when they meet with maids, Sweete loue now let me intreate you sit, And welcome you to your owne banquet heere, Sa. Euen thus did Irus say that he should say, Then by your leaue sir I will sit with you, Le. VVelcome as gold into my tresurie, And now will I drinke vnto my loue. VVith the same mind that drinking first began to one another. Sa. And what was that I pray sir. Le. Ile tell my loue the first kind cause of it. And why tis vsd as kindnesse still amongst vs, If it be vsd a right tis to this end, VVhen I doe say I drinke this loue to you, I meane I drinke this to your proper good, As if I sayde what health this wine doth worke in mee, Shalbe imploied for you at your commande &amp; to your proper vse And this was first thentent of drinking to you. Sa. Tis very prettie is it not Jaquine. Iaquine. Oh excellent Mistris hees a daintie man. Leon. Now to your vse sweete loue I drinke this wine, And with a merrie hart that makes long life, Ouer the cup Ile sing for my loues sake. Song. Health, fortune, mirth, and wine, To thee my loue deuine. I drinke to my dareling, Giue mee thy hand sweeting. VVith cuppe full euer plyed, And hartes full neuer dryed. Mine owne, mine owne dearest sweeting, Oh oh myne owne dearest sweeting. VVhat frollicke loue mirth makes the banquet sweete. Sa. I loue it sir aswell as you loue me. Leon. That is aswell as I do loue my selfe, I will not Ioy my treasure but in thee, And in thy lookes Ile count it euery hower, And thy white armes shalbe as bandes to me, Wherein are mightie Lordshippes forfeited, And all the dames of Alexandria, For their attire shall take there light from thee, Sa. VVel sir I drinke to you &amp; pray you thinke You are as welcome to me as this wine, Le. Thankes gentle Samathis, but delitious loue, Hath beene the figge I eate before this wine, VVhich kills the taste of these delitious cates, VVill you bestowe that banquet loue on me, Sa. Nay gentle Leon talke no more of loue If you loue God or a good countenance, For I shal quite be out of countenance then, Le. Loue deckes the countenance, speriteth the eye, And tunes the soule in sweetest harmony, Loue then sweete Samathis. Sama. VVhat shall I doe Iaquine. Iaquine. Fayth Mistris take him. Sa. Oh but he hath a great nose. Ia. Tis no matter for his nose, for he is rich. Sa. Leon I loue and since tis foorth farewell. Le. Then triumph Leon richer in thy loue. Then all the heapes of treasure I possesse, Neuer was happie Leon rich before, Nor euer was I couetous till now, That I see gold so fined in thy haire. Sa. Impart it to my Parentes gentle Leon, And till we meete agayne at home farewell. Exeunt. Le. Soone will I talke with them and follow thee, So now is my desire accomplished. Now was there euer man so fortunate. To haue his loue so sorted to his wish, The ioyes of many I'm one enioy. Now do I meane to woe them crossely both, The one as I am Leon the rich vsurer. The other as I am the mad brayne Count. VVhich if it take effect, and rightly proue, Twill be a sporte for any emperours loue. Exit. Enter Ptolomie, Aegiale, Doricles, Aspatia, Ianthe, Euphrosine, Clearchus, Euribates, with sonnd, Pto. Prince of Arcadia louely Doricles, Be not discouraged that my daughter heere, Like a well fortified and loftie tower, Is so repulsiue and vnapt to yeelde, The royall siege of your heroycke partes, In her acheeuement will be more renound, And with the greater merite is imployde. The bewtious queene my wife her mother here VVas so well mand and yet had neuer man, So mayne a rocke of chast and cold disdayne. Aegi. My Lord what meane ye, go Aspasia, Send for some Ladeis to goe play with you, At chesse, at Billiardes, and at other game, Ianthe attend her. You take a course my Lord to make her coy, To vrge so much the loue of Doricles, And frame a vertue of her wanton hate, VVe must perswade her that he loues her not, But that his seruices and vowes of loue, Are but the gentle complimentes of court, So would shee thinke that if she would haue loud, Shee might haue wonne him. And with that conceite of hardnesse to be wonne, His merites grace will shine more cleanely, In her turning eyes, Thinges hard to win with case makes loue incited, And fauours wonne with ease are hardly quited, Then make as If you loud her not my Lord. Do. Loue that hath built his temple on my browes Out of his Battlementes into my hart, And seeing me to burne in my desire, VVill be I hope appeased at the last. Aegi. Be ruld by me yet, and I warrant you, She quickly shall beleeue you loue her not, Do. VVhat shall I doe Madam. Aegi. Looke not on her so much. Do. I cannot chuse my neck standes neuer right, Till it be turnd asside and I behold her. Aegi. Now trust me such a wrie neckt loue was neuer sene, But come with me my Lord and Ile instruct you better Pto. So maddam I leaue you now from our loue sportes, To Antistenes and his great sute with Leon, Enter Antistenes Leon and Burgomaister. See the Burgomaister Antistenes and Leon. Comes togeather stay maister Burgomaister. VVhat reason made you vse your office on the Lord Antistenes seazing on al his moueables, And goodes at the sute of Leon. Pe. I will tell your grace the reason of it or any Thinge els for I know you are a wise prince, And apt to learne. Pto. I thanke you for yout good opinion sir, But the reason of your office done vpon this noble man And his landes. Pe. The reason why I haue put in office or execution, My authoritie vpon this nobleman consisteth, in three principall poyntes or members, VVhich indeede are three goodly matters. Ptolo. I pray you lets heare them. Pe. The first is the credit of this honest man because he is rich. Pto. VVhy is he honest because he is rich. Pe. Oh I learne that in any case, the next is the forfaite of his assurance and the last I will not trouble your grace with all. An. But this it is whereof I most complaine vnto your grace, That hauing occasion in your graces seruice, To borow mony of this Leon heere, For which I morgagd al my landes and goods He onely did agree that paying him foure thousand pound at the day I should receiue my statute safely, in which now not onely falsely he denies. But that he hath receiued one penny due, VVhich this my friend can wittnes I repayde, Vpon the stone of Irus the blinde man, Foure thousand pound in Iewels and in golde, And therefore craue I iustice in this case, Le. Voutchsafe dread soueraigne an vnpartiall care. To that I haue to say for my replye, He pleades the payment of foure thousand pounde, Vpon the stone before blinde Irus caue, To which I answere and do sweare by heauen, He spake with me at the foresayde place, And promist payment of foure thousand pound, If I would let him haue his statutes in, And take other assurance for another thousand, Some three monthes to come or thereaboutes. VVhich I refusing he repayde me none, But parted in a rage and card not for me. Gen. Oh monstrous who euer hard the like, My Lord I will besworne he payde him, On poore Irus stone foure thousand pound, VVhich I did helpe to tender and hast thou A hellish conscience and such a brasen forhead, To denye it agaynst my wittnesse, And his noble woorde. Le. Sir agaynst your witnesse and his noble worde, I plead myne owne and one as good as his, That then was present at our whole conference. An. My Lord there was not any but our selues, But who was it that thou affirmst was there, Le. Count Hermes good my Lord a man VVell knowne though he be humorous to be honorable, Pto. And will he saie it. Le. He will my gratious Lord I am well assurd, And him will I send hether presently, Intreating your gratious fauour if the impediment, Of a late sickenesse cause me not returne, For I am passing ill. Pto. Well send him hether and it shall suffice. Le. I will my gratious Lord and stand To any censure passing willingly, Your highnesse shall set downe or commaund, VVorshipfull maister Burgomaister your officer, To see performd betwixt vs. Exit. Pe. VVe Thanke you hartely, alas poore soule, How sicke he is. Truly I cannot chuse but pittie him, In that he loues your gratious officers. Enter Coont. Pto. Oh I thanke you sir. Count.

You are to witnesse twixt Antistenes and welthy Leon. Count. I know the matter and I come from that old miser Leon, who is sodainely fallen sicke of a knaues euill, Which of you are troubled with that disease maisters. Pto. VVel say what you know of the matter, betwixt them. Count. Then thus I say my Lord, Antistenes came, To the stone of the blinde foole Irus, That day when foure thousand pounds were to be payde, VVhere he made proffer of so much mony if Leon would returne the morgage of his lands, and take assurance for another thousand to be paide I trow some three monthes to come or there about, which Leon like an olde churle as hee was most vncourteously refused: my Lord Antistenes as he might very well departed in a rage but if it had beene to me I would haue pistoled him I fayth. Au. But you are wonderously deceiued my Lord. And was not by when he and we did talke. Count. Swounes then I say you are deceiued my Lord, For I was by now by my honor and by all the gods. Eu. Then you stoode close my Lord vnseene to any, Count. VVhy I stood close to you and seene of all, and if You thinke I am too mad a fellow to witnes such a waightie peece of worke the holy begger shall performe as much, For he was by at our whole conference. Pto. But say Count Hermes was the begger by. Count. I say he was and he shall say he was. Euri. But he is now they say lockt in his caue, Fasting and praying talking with the Gods, And hath an Iron doore twixt him and you, How will you then come at him, Count. Ile fetch him from his caue in spight of all his Gods and Iron dores, or beate him blinde when as I doe catch him next, farwell my Lordes you haue done with mee, Ile send the begger presently for I am now ryding to Corrucus. Exit. Pto. I know not what to thinke in these affaires I cannot well condemne you my Lord, And your sufficient witnesse beeing a gentleman, Nor yet the other two, both men or credit, Though in his kinde this Count be humorous, But stay we shall here straight what Irus wil depose, Enter Irus. Irus Oh who disturbes me in my holy prayers, Oh that the king were by that he might heere, VVhat thundring there is at my farther doore, Oh how the good of Ægipt is disturbd in my deuotion. Pto. I am here Irus and it was Count Hermes. That was so rude to Interrupt thy prayers, But I suppose the end of thy repayre, Beeing so waightie could not haue displeasd, For on thy witnesse doth depend the liuing Of Lord Antistenes, who doth affirme, That three dayes past he rendered at thy stone, Foure thousand poundes to Leon and desired His morgage quited which he promising On such assurance, more as he proposed, Receiued at that tyme his foure thousand pounds. Irus. I then was in the hearing of them both. But hard noe penny tendred, onely proposed By Lord Antistenes, if he would bring him in, His morgage and take assurance for another thousand Some three monthes to come or there aboutes, VVhich Leon most vncourteously refused, My Lord was angrye and I hard no more, And thus must I craue pardon of your grace. Exit Pto. Farewell graue Irus. An. Gods are become oppressors of the right. Euge. Neuer had right so violent a wrong. For let the thunder strike me into hell. If what I haue reported be not true, Pto. This holy man no doubt speakes what he hard And I am sory for Antistenes. But Ile releeue your lowe estate my Lord, And for your seruice done megwerdon you, Maister Burgomaister let the Lord haue libertie, And I will answere Leon what is due. Exeunt. Enter Elimime, Martia, Samathis. Eli. Soft Mistris Burgomaister, pray you stay, your hart is greater then your parson farre or your state eyther, doe we not know ye trow, what woman you are but a Burgomaisters wife, And he no wiser then his neighbours neyther, Giue me the place acording to my calling. Mar. VVhat skill for places, do we not all call sisters, Eli. Noe by my fayth I am a countesse now, I should haue one to goe before me bare, And say stand by there to the best of them, And one to come behinde and beare my trayne, Because my handes must not be put vnto it. My husband is a Lord and past a Lord, Sa. And past a Lord what is that past I pray, Eli. VVhy hees a what you calt. Mar. A what you call it can you not name it. Eli. I thinke I must not name it. Sa.

VVhy therefore he is an vnknowne man. Mar. I but my husband is the kings officer. Sa. I but my husband is able to buy both yours, Eli. You say husband, I may saie my Lord. Mar. And me thinkes husband is worth ten of Lord. Eli. Indeede I loue my Lord to call mee wife, Better then Maddam yet doe I not meane, To lose my Ladies, titles at your handes, I may for courtesie and to be termd, A gentle Ladie call you sisters still, But you must say and please your Ladishippe, Tis thus and so, and as your honor please, Yet shall my husband call me wife like youres, For why made god the husband and the wife, But that those tearmes should please vs more then others New fashion tearmes I like not for a man, To call his wife cony, forsooth, and Lambe, And Porke, and Mutton, he as well may say, Mar. VVell Madam then and please your Ladishippe. VVhat gownes and head tyres will your honor weare. Eli. Twentie are making for me head tyres and gownes, Head tyres enchast in order like the starres, VVhich perfit great and fine cut pretious stones, One hath bright Ariadnes Crowne in it, Euen in the figure it presentes in heauen, Another hath the fingers of Diana, And Berenices euer burning haire, An other hath the bright Andromica, VVith both her siluer wristes bound to a rocke, And Perseus that did lose her and saue her life, All set in number and in perfect forme, Euen like the Asterismes fixt in heauen, And euen as you may see in Moone shine nightes, The Moone and Starres reflecting on their streames So from my head shall you see starres take beames, Mar. Oh braue God willing I will haue the like. Sa. And so will I by Gods grace if I liue. Eli. Come vp to supper it will become the house wonderfull well Mar, Well if my husband will not, let him not loke for one good looke of me. Sa. Nor mine I sweare. Mar. Ile aske my husband when I am with child, And then I know I shall be sped I fayth. Eli. But euery pleasure hath a payne they say My husband lies each other nyght abrode, Sa. and so doth mine which I like but little, Mar. VVell time I hope and change of companie, VVill teach vs somewhat to beare out the absence, Exit. Eli. I know not what to say, My husband makes as if each other nyght he had occasion, To ride from home at home serues not his turne, To my good turne it, cupid I beseech you, Enter Leon and Druso following him. Le. Now will I trie to make my selfe the Count. An arrant Cuckold and a wittoll too. Dru. Now may I chance to proue a cunning man, And tell my mistris where my maister hauntes, Le. Bright Nimph I come in name of all the worlde, That now sustaines dead winter in the spring, To haue a graces from thy summer darted, Thy loue sweetesoule is all that I desire, To make a generall sommer in this hair, VVhere winters duble wrath hath turrannisde. Eli. How dare you Leon thus solicit mee, VVhere if the Count my husband should come now, And see you courting you were sure to die. Le. Oh but he is safe, for at my house, Booted and spurd and in his veluet gowne, He tooke his horse and rode vnto Corrucus, And therefore beautious Ladie make not strange, To take a freind and adde vnto thy Ioyes, Of happie wedlocke: the end of euery acte, Is to increase contentment and renowne, Both which my loue: shall amplye ioy in you, Eli. How can renowne ensue an act of shame, Le. No acte hath any shame within it selfe, But in the knowledge and ascription. Of the base world from whom shall this be kept, As in a laborinth or a brasen tower. El. But vertues sole regard must hold me backe. Le. The vertue of each thing is in the prayse, And I will reare thy prayses to the skyes, Out of my tresurie chuse the choyse of gold, Till thou finde some matching thy harye in brightnesse, But that will neuer, be so chuse thou euer. Out of my Iewelrye chuse thy choyse of Diamondes, Till thou finde some as bright some as thyne eyes, But that will neuer be, so chuse thou euer, Chuse Rubies out vntill thou match thy lippes, Pearle till thy teeth, and Iuorie till thy skinne, Be matcht in whitnesse but that wil neuer bee. Nor neuer shall my tresurie haue end, Till on there beauties Ladies loth to spend, But that will neuer be so chuse thou euer. Eli. Now what a gods name would this vayne man haue, Do you not shame to tempt a woman thus, I know not what to saye nor what to doe, He would haue me doe that I feare I should not, Some thing it is he seekes that he thinkes good, And me thinkes he should be more wise then I, I am a foolish girle though I be married And know not what to doe, the Gods doe know. Leon. Are you content sweete loue to graunt me loue, Eli. and what then sir. Le. To grant me lodging in your house this night, Eli. I thinke the man be wearie of his life, Know you the Count my husband. Le. Marueilous well and am assurd of him, Eli. Faith that you are as sure as I my selfe, So you did talke of gold and Diamonds, Leon. I and gold and Diamondes shal my sweet loue haue, Eli. VVell Ile not bid you sir but if you come, At your owne perill for Ile wash my handes. Offer to goe out. Leon. A plague of all sanguine simpliciti Eli. But do you heare sir pray you do not thinke that I granted you. in any case Le. No I warrant you, Ile haue no such thought. Oh this is olde excellent. Now who can desire better sporte. This nyght my other wife must lie alone, And next night this wife must doe the like. Now will I woe the other as the Count. VVhich if she graunt and they do breake their troth, Ile make my selfe a cuckolde twixt them both. Exit. Druso. Ile follow him vntill he take the earth, and then ile leaue him. Exit. Enter Samathis alone. Sa. Now if my husband be not all alone, He is from home and hath left me alone, So I must learne to lie, as children goe, All alone, all alone, which lesson now.

The King, come come tis you rule the King now would any wise woman in the worlde be so hunger starued for a man and not vse the meanes to haue him, thinkst thou Cleanthes will come agayne to haue his head chopt of so soone as he comes, but had you pluckt vp this branch wherein the King thy husbandes life consistes and burnt it in the fyre, his olde beard would haue stuncke fort in the graue ere this, and then thou shouldst haue seene whether Cleanthes would haue come vnto thee or noe.

He then should conquere all our bordering landes, And make vs subiect to his tirrannie. Rhe. Trusting to his fond fantasticke dreames, He hath exild the warlicke Duke Cleanthes.

Wicked Count Hermes for this monsterous deede, Ægypt will hate thee. and thou sure must dye, Then hye thee to the hils beyond the Aipes, Flye to vnknowne and vnfrequented climes, Some des ert place that neuer sawe the sunne, For if the king or any of his friendes, Shall finde Count Hermes thou art surely dead. Count. Ile flye no more then doth a setled rocke, No more then mountaines or the steadfast powles, But come sweete loue if thou wilt come with me, We two will liue amongst the shadowy groues, And we will sit like shepherdes on a hill, And with our heauenly voyces tice the trees, To eccho sweetely to our cœlestiall tunes, Fls will I angle in the running brookes, Seasoning our toyles with kisse, on the bankes, Sometime Ile diue into the murmerrng springes, And fetch thee stones to hang about thy necke, VVhich by thy splendor will be turnd to pearle, Say fayre Aspasia wilt thou walke with me. As. No bloody Count but I will cleare my selfe, girle And tell thy murders to the amased court. Count. Nay if thou wilt not chuse you peeuish Thou canst not say but thou wert offered fayre, But here must end Count Hermes strange disguise, My veluet gowne my pistoll and this patch, No more must hide me in the countes attire, Now will I turne my gowne to Vsurers Cotes, And thus appeare vnto the worlde no more, Farewell Aspasia.

In vayne do I resist my passions, Mightie Cleanthes to annex my hart, In loue to thee aswell as victorie, Grant this fayre countesse here may be my queene. Po. No great Cleanthes giue her to my hand, VVhose hart was first the subiect of her graces. Rhe. Then let the Arabian king make this his queene. Bi. Nay this Cleanthes let my loue inioy. Cle. How fatall are these loues now I perceaue, Their fortunes that I told as I was Irus. VVill now in force I see be come to passe. Sa. Oh holy Irus blessed be thy tongue, That like an orator hath told our fortunes. Eli. He told vs we should soone lose our first loues, Making our second choise mongst greatest kinges. Cle. I did indeede, but God knowes knew not how. Pe. How say you maister brother, am not I secret now, Cle. Thou art and be so still for not the worlde, Shall euer know the mad prankes I haue played, Now stand fayre my Lordes and let these Ladies view you, Eli. In my eye now the blackest is the fayrest, For euery woman chooseth white and red, Come martiall Perus thou shalt haue my loue. Be. Out on thee foolish woman thou hast chose a deuill. Pe. Not yet sir til he haue hornes. Sa. Tis not the face and colour I regard, But fresh and louely youth allures my choyse, And thee most beautious Bion I affecte. Rhe. Haplesse is Rhesus. Bebri. Accurst Bebritius. Cle. Haue patience gentle Lordes I will prouide, Other Ægyptian Ladies for your turne, So will we linke in perfit league of loue, So shall the victorie you lost to me, Set double glorie on your conquered heades. So let vs goe to frolicke in our Court. Carousing free whole boules of greekish wine, In honor of the conquest we haue made, That at our banquet all the Gods may tend, Plauding our victorie and this happie end. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
