      <field name="fulltext">Queen Catharine: OR, THE Ruines of Love. A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable Mrs COOK of Norfolk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE: Spoken by Mr. Batterton. 'Tis grown so hard a Task to please the Town, We scarce can tell what Prologue will go down: But right or wrong a Prologue must be writ, A dull one sometimes may divert the Pit, Substantial dullness does as well as wit. For if you laugh, what matter whence the mirth, Whether from plenty of the Wit, or dearth? A heavy English Tale to day, we show As e'er was told by Hollingshead or Stow, Shakespear did oft his Countries worthies chuse, Nor did they by his Pen their Lustre lose. Hero's revive thro' him, and Hotspur's rage, Doubly adorns and animates the Stage: But how shall Woman after him succeed, And what excuse can her presumption plead. Who with enervate voice dares wake the mighty dead; To please your martial men she must despair, And therefore Courts the favour of the fair: From huffing Hero's she hopes no relief, But trusts in Catharine's Love, and Isabella's grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILGOUE: Written by Mrs. Trotter. Spoken by Miss Porter. What Epilogues are made, for who can tell, 'Twere worth the pains to write and speak'em well. If they cou'd gain your favour for bad Plays, But by their merit you'll condemn or praise: 'Tis but a form, no matter then by whom, Or what is said, and therefore I am come. I, who no partial Voice can hope t'engage, No graces of my own, nor of the Stage: But tho' I cannot yet expect to move, Or merit either your applause or love: Sure practising so young I may improve. That's all I come for: what's the Play to me, And since I'm here, I think I'll let you see, What you're to hope, I may hereafter be. Come, a short taste of some Hervick now? But do not trust me, no, for if you do, By all the furies and the flames of Love: By Love, which is the hottest burning Hell, I'll set you both on fire to blaze for ever. How was that done, I'll swear it pleases me, And tho' I came careless of your decree, If favouring, or against our Tragedy, Methinks I'm now grown tender of its fate, Who knows but I may come to act Queen Kate.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the First. Scene the First. Enter Edward IV. Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Warwick, and several Lords, as rising from Council. Edw. Noble are your resolves, my worthy Friends: Yes! we will meet again this Warlike Queen, Who wields her self the Sword, and gives the Distaff To the Effeminate and Holy Henry: My Lord of Warwick, Guide and Father now, Ever Unconquer'd leader of the War! You saw, your Eyes beheld the fall of York, Made a short promise to his mounting spirit, That you wou'd still assist his daring Sons. The dying Hero at the assurance smil'd, Pleas'd, and secur'd, he left this Earth to us. With Warwick on our side, what Foe can shock us, So Guarded, even Gyants to our Souls Appear like Infants, and can move no terrour. Shall then a Woman, a rash giddy Woman, Oppose the Force and Arm of Hercules? O Vanity! Warw. Vain are indeed these Words; go, Royal Edward; Pour on the fairer Sex thy Oily speeches, Joyn'd with thy goodly Person, there they can't Fail of Success; but give me trust, not flattery. The rule of Sacred Justice be thy word? As well in virtue, as in name be King; And then if I forsake thee, may this Arm, To which I owe the Power of executing Your Noble Orders in the dusty field, Be lost, and all the Courage that inspires it. Edw. I'm hush'd, the talking Genius now is silent, List'ning to those great Oracles you utter. Enter Clarence. War. Here comes Clarence, like a Bridegroom drest. My Lord of Gloucester! I believe these gay Princes Think we rough Fellows were only made To tug for them for Conquests in the War; Force from Crown'd heads their feeble Sceptres; Then all our toyl and labour's paid, when we Behold how well the gawdy Robe becomes them. Glou. Rather let the bright Circle tear, tear Their beauteous Fronts, and leave them horrid, [Aside. As spightfull Nature has form'd mine. I'm of your mind, my Lord, observe how [To Warwick. Exactly my Brothers locks are curl'd. Clar. I'm glad to find you thus dispos'd, my Lords, And the Foe within our view. Edw. I thought you knew not of their near approach, Else what made you absent at our last grand Council? You have yet been learning, why the shining Court Of Catharine, thus hovers near our Camp, Forsaking her more peacefull Palaces? She now is garrison'd in Ludlow Castle. Clar. Of the motions, that Beauty makes, my Lord, As I expected you are always first inform'd. Warw. This discourse will be too hot. Come, You lovely branch of the Plantagenets, Let's view the Troops: tho' a Courtier now; Yet in the fight you'll prove an English Hero. [Exeunt War. Clar. Edw. Brother, come near. My Lords, pray retire. Ex. Lords. Brother and Friend, I long have sought these moments, In which I might pour the secrets of my Soul Into your faithful Bosom: Much I expect From thee, tho' Nature seems thy body To have rufled up in haste, the rich gifts Within have amply made amends; for there Thou excellest all her humane Sons, as far As they do thee in Empty, Worthless, tho' Beauteous forms. Glou. For all my Step dames gifts, I only thank her, In that she has firmly fixt my Faith and Love To you, my Royal Brother and my Lord. Edw. Didst thou observe how Clarence frown'd and sigh'd When Warwick askt him to view our Troops. The Court of Catharine's the cursed Cause; There, Oh! there, the ignoble youth is ruin'd. Glou. This I knew before: But now I expected Something to hear related of the first, The noblest and most perfect of our Race. Speak Heavens appointed King, why at the name Of Catharine's Court do I still observe A sigh, a pause, some sudden start of Nature, Otherways unusual in your even temper? It can't be Love, for justly you are call'd The Royal Rover; you wander o'er the Field Of tempting Beauty, with wanton revelling Joy; And if you crop a Flower, the rifled sweet Is thrown neglected by; to whither in some Forgotten shade; nor ever did you make A business of what Nature meant a trifle, By giving us desires so prone, so apt, So pleas'd with Change. Edw. Since the decisive day approaches near, In which the work of many years is fated, Glory and Conquest wait that pointed time, Or in the Field an Honourable death: Give orders that we are not Interrupted, And thou shalt hear the weakness of thy Brother. [Exit Gloucester, and returns. Glou. Silence, and Secrecy wait upon your words! Edw. I need not tell you Friend, that I stood The first and dearest in our Father's Love. Too well his partial kindness was exprest, In my most Noble, Liberal Education. When first he brought me to that Mart the Court, Catharine was Regent; Introduc'd I view'd That Queen with extasie and strange amazement, Methought she look'd and mov'd beyond her Sex; And something whisper'd to my ravisht Soul, She is a Goddess! Glou. In those blooming years she was approv'd By all a wonder, nor yet has fate or time Exhausted the vast stock, she still appears As one that's born to die a beauty: Pray, Sir, proceed. Edw. I kneel'd to kiss her hand; but then forgot The Ceremony was over, and rooted there Gaz'd on the pointed rays shot from those Globes Of Beauty, her resistless Eyes, till they Reach'd and pierc'd my heart. Now, the Martial Horse can please no more; The Bow unstrung neglected lay; and all The Glorious exercises of my forward youth, Wherewith I had with Emulation strove To out-do each Rival. To Grots and Solitudes Retir'd, I hid me from the busie World: Gave up my self to thought, To thoughts of Love and Rapture, which perhaps Was not in her to give, at least not ordain'd For me. Glou. How cou'd you fear, my Lord, your Birth, your Form And your abundant Wealth might give you hopes To gain your Mistress, tho' she were a Queen. Edw. Canst thou forgive the poorness of my spirit? When I confess, I serv'd that haughty Queen, With all the lowest marks of servile Courtship: Fled at her command, trembl'd at her frown, And at her anger dy'd, at length resolv'd To know my fate; beneath her feet I fell; In dying Accents I confess'd my Love: She with an unrelenting look reply'd, It is impossible! you never can be mine. With groans and sighs I begg'd her change that Never; That terror to the damn'd, and death to me; And all my hopes to any other word, but she, Deaf to my Prayers, my Vows, repeated often, Remember Earl of March! never, never. Glou. Foolish Woman! to resist at once her glory And her safety: some other Love, I guess, Gave this strong passion ease. Edw. Yes, on her side, not mine? no Gloucester, Gloucester! I was the constant'st Fool, that e'er that Sex With more than Necromantique Charms enchain'd; Till at last convinc'd that Owen Tuder Held the heart and person of the Queen; Revenge despite of such a Rival cast Forth from my breast the darling God of Love. Glou. How cou'd Tudor then escape your Vengeance Or did you not believe his boasted descent From Great Cadwalladar the British King, So thought him a Plebeian beneath your Sword? Edw. Let everlasting silence shrowd that truth, And to after Ages in Oblivion's Grave, May what I tell my Brother be forgotten; I did pursue him with my eager wrongs; But oh! He foil'd my unexperienc'd youth, And in the Combat overcame the Cause: Since that curs'd moment, I and my engines have Rais'd him plagues, which he cou'd ne'er surmount, And made Imperious Margaret his foe, That furious Queen, whose anger knows no end: Now he's confin'd to his own barren soil, Hunted from Katharine's eyes, those kindly rays, That warm'd his passions even to extasie. Glou. But now proud Margaret descends and courts That Tudor, whom she has despis'd, To assist her cause in this extremity. In vain their weakned Forces can oppose My Godlike Brother, whom Fate has doom'd Her Conqueror. Edw. No doubt he obeys the summons, and comes on To meet us there; in the heat of all the battle Thro' the rang'd troops my Sword shall point him out; Yes; by my wrongs I swear, by all the Racks Of disappointed Love, my abler Arm Shall for the weakness of my Youth at one. I'll hack his beauteous body, since even rage And envy must allow his Person lovely. Till doting Katharine shall not distinguish His mangl'd Carcass from the meanest Slave's. Glou. You speak with so much passion, that if daily You did not quench your flames in dear variety, I still shou'd think you lov'd the Queen. Edw. The sweets of Love are gone, my Friend, but still The sting remains, the sting of her denial. Oh! what a torment 'tis to know another Enjoys that Bliss, for which I sigh'd in vain, But Revenge is more lasting, fiercer far, If not so pleasing as fond Boyish Love. Glou. His approach brings the fair Queen To this Castle, that lies between our Camps, Suppose I glut the angry God within your Breast, and find a way to kill this hated Tudor In her arms. Edw. 'Twou'd charm me more than to revel in them now. Glou. Mind you the pleasures that your heart is fond of, And leave this business to your faithful Brother. Lord Dacres and Sir James Tyrell rule the Queen, Dacres is honest, trusty, not to be mov'd By bribes or prayers; Tyrell is mine, and so is Malavill, Clarence's Favourite, nor shall the amorous Boy Wed the beauteous Ward of Katharine, Isabella, Half English, half French, I like not The mixt breed. Edw. That be thy labour'd care, for if he matches In that abandon'd Family; we lose a Brother. Come to my arms, and let me swear, my Gloucester, Thou shar'st the Heart and Crown of thy lov'd Edward. Glou. I hope, great Sir, you'll ne'er repent the trust You have impos'd upon your ready Servant. Edw. I thank thee, Gloucester, and I believe thee too, Who waits on Fate, will find her Laws are just, And patience will at length our wishes Crown I cou'd ask no more, than this To mount the Throne of my ungratefull Fair And dash her back that bitter Cup, despair. [Exeunt. Enter Malavill to Gloucester. Mala. My Lord, are you alone. Glou. I am, and you are safe. Haste, dear Malavill. Quick, inform me what More of Importance since our last Conference Has reach'd thy knowledge. Mala. I am afraid, if discover'd, I can No longer serve your Grace. Glou. Therefore be quick in your Narration! Mala. Fair Isabella from the Castle meets My Lord of Clarence in the adjoining Grove. And there I've learnt, he means to try The utmost eloquence of Conquering Love, To perswade his Mistress to fly the Kingdom. Glou. Dear Malavill, observe my orders, you shan't want Gold But at the meeting, let not a falling syllable Escape thee, How stands, Sir James Thyrrold? Mala. Fixt to our Cause, as fate, fonder far Of Isabella than he is of Life; to Hell He'd plunge to sink his Reval. Glou. My Lord Dacres, will he leave the Queen; Is Tudor's coming on confirm'd? Mala. All as you cou'd wish: heark, a noise! I dare not stay to tell you more. (Exit. Glou. Work on my brain, help every faculty; And thou invention stretch, till thou hast wound me Into the bottom of my Brothers Councils: Then give destruction power, a Crown alone Can safely shrou'd those foul deformities. Those glorious rays wou'd dazle mocking Gazers; The amongst the crowd no sawcy Slave, Wou'd dare in whispers to pronounce me monstrous. The Ladie's too, caught with unbounded sway: The Royal Purple to this uncouth trunk Gives form, and vigour to this sapless Limb. By Heaven, nature sent me Here in spite to plague her upright Race. 'Twas her design! nor shall she lose her end, A Real Foe, and deep dissembling Friend: Near the Crown, but not near enough ally'd, Tho Seas of Blood my Title do divide, Cruel and bold I'll wade the Kindred tide.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Second. SCENE Ludlow Castle. SCENE draws, discovers Queen Catharine seated: attended by the Lord Dacres, Sir James Tyrell, &amp;c. Ladies. She rises. Cat. Tho' Margaret, Daughter only of a titled King; Who for her Portion brought my wanting Henry, What he wanted least, expensive Pride: Tho, she I say, ranks me with her Foes, Has taken pains to estrange me from the breast, And fatal Counsels of her ruin'd Husband! Yet so dear I hold my Son, that to his aid, I wou'd not spare my Officers of State alone; Alas! now they are few, succouring him, My self I'll strip of each menial Servant; But oh, my Lord, when I Reflect on your departure, My nature by continual injuries made bold, Shrinks back, and all my Courage fails me. Dacres. The only merit I can plead, is my obedience, The Creature of your Commands. Cat. Wisely and well did thy Great Master choose, Who dying left me to thy Guardian care; So perfect has my Loyal Dacres prov'd, That I dare read thy very thoughts, and pronounce They never swerv'd one title from my Interest. Ev'n preferment, that Common bait, and Ruine of a Courtiers Honesty, cou'd never tempt thee from me, but now! The sad hour's arriv'd, that calls thee forth: Thy prudence and thy courage must out To save a sinking King. Dac. O, sacred relick of the first of Heroes! For what was Alexander, but a Name Compar'd with our Immortal Henry? It's true, the first ravag'd o'er effeminate Persia And a barbarous World; but my unequall'd King Conquer'd his numerous neighbours, Older much Than He, and therefore thought more skill'd in Arms: Fenc'd Towns, nor Armed men cou'd barr his fury, Which like Groves, darkn'd th'expanded plain; Thro' treble numbers he forc'd his way to victory; Doubly blest, subdueing France, and being by you Subdu'd: Yet in this full tide of Fortune mark, The weakness of the best of humane frames, Either the excess of sorrow, or of Joy, Cracks the strings of life, and we moulder Into our first nothing; when thousand pious hands Were lifting up to Heav'n for his safety, Ev'n then our mighty King expir'd. Cat. Well hast thou choos'd this melancholy theam, It suits our parting, Noble Dacres, well. Dac. By Heav'n! I cannot mention that Great Man, But the vast story dwells upon my tongue; But now I thought to look a little backwards, And tell my beauteous Queen the many tyes, That link me her faithful Slave: when loe! At the name of Glorious Henry; my words Flow'd to Encomiums; and left my worthless self forgot. Cat. It needs not, Sir, O, could I but reward, As I remember all thy Services, How woud'st thou shine, bedeck'd with Royal Favours. Now thy advice, and then farewell: do you think The Garrison drawn off, and then my Guard remov'd, I'm safe, not that I'm mention'd in the War; But I wou'd not be expos'd to that power, that has No Justice for its rule. Dac. Madam, this Castle was built by Vortigern, See but the Keys of the Avenues in Trusty hands; Edward may wast his Army here, E're give you any cause for a disturbance. Sir James Thyrrold, to your charge I leave My Queen; if thou shou'dst prove a Traytor, ah! How came these words upon my tongue, without A moments thought. Tyr. Without a cause, you shou'd have said, what have I done to be mistrusted? Cat. Thyrrold hold! it was his care for me; If yours is equal, then you must excuse it. Adieu, Commend me to Henry and the Queen, Tell them my endeavours and my Prayers shall still Attend them. Dac. O thou forgiving Virtue! Everlasting Charmer! Whose sight alone gave thy dying Lord Transports too great for mortal life to bear. Here let me fix my parting duty, and Eternal Blessings Crown thee. Cat. Victory, great as thy faith and worth, be thine. Go, and in my Closet lay the Books I read in last. [Exit Dacres. Where's now the crowded Court of Paris, Rheims, or Windsor, when scarce a passage Cou'd be made for gazing Princes, and for Kneeling Subjects; when illustrious Henry Crown'd the assembly, and supported me. Yet I agen was happy, my Virgin Love, The very pride and boast of Nature, Tudor, My Henry's Soul cast in purer mold; He was mine, him have they robb'd me of; And I have nothing left at my command, But these sad Eyes, which of themselves will flow. Enter Isabella. Isa. [kneeling.] Angels protect the Queen, may I once prove The happy Messenger, and stamp that Clouded Heaven with smiles. From Tudor this? [Gives a Letter. Cat. See, Isabella, see; forgetting his repeated wrongs, He flies, to the assistance of the ungrateful Margaret; Am I to blame, now in the wrack of Fate, When rowling Tempests bear my Glory's down? Is it a fault, I say, to feel Loves alarm, Busie at my heart, and dawning Joy Break on me at his approach? Isa. Is it a fault to love the Master-piece of Heaven, And wonder of the Earth? such Tudor is: Then, Madam, to you, not the first of humane Race Was ever half so faithfull or so fond; were all Mankind like him, believing, Virgins never Cou'd be ruin'd. Cat. He is indeed a Husband, whose unbated passion, The fiercest new made Lover ne'er can equal; Here he begs, that thro' that Secret Vault, Which to the Castle Leads, known but to a trusted few, He may in private see me. You, dear Isabella, Have the Important Keys, take the Letter, Observe the hour, and be carefull. Isa. Madam, I will. Cat. Why dost thou sigh, my Girl; you dare not make Your Queen your Confident, yet I have found The secret of your Soul. Young Plantagent, whom they call Clarence now, In our prosperous days, with my allowance, paid his vows to thee: Love's soft, first Impression hangs about thy heart. I read it in thy watry eyes? But, oh! I warn thee Of that rebelling and most treacherous Race: If thou regardest the safety of thy Queen, Or thy own future Peace, Throw from thy thoughts the faithless Fugitive. I warn thee of him; and when thou'rt warn'd, beware. [Exit. Cat. Isa. And when thou'rt warn'd, beware. It strikes upon my Soul, and echoes back, Like the sad voice of Fate. I'll follow streight The Queen, give her up the Keys, confess The frailty of my Conquer'd heart; And see the Lovely, Charming youth no more. See him no more! what has my Clarence done So to be punish'd? does he not droop In midst of Lawrels, Crowns, and Victories? Or aims he at a Bliss without his Isabella? Are not his Vows Registred in Heaven? And every awfull power call'd to witness? Shall I then forsake him? No: Be it my ruin, it has a face so pleasing, I'll fly to plunge into it. [Is going. Enter Sir James Thyrrold. Sir J. [kneeling.] Turn, ah! too Lovely, Heavenly maid! let not. Those eyes, that light the rest of the World To Joy, dart only on me Confusion; behold The humble Thyrrold at your feet; hear The sad tale my Love inspires; Oh can that sweet form, that looks all softness, Contain a Savage heart. Isa. Presuming Arrogance. Can no Commands Impose on you eternal silence? yet I'm calm: But if again you affront me with your sawcy passion, The Queen shall know it, who, no doubt, will Protect a Maid committed to her Royal care, From Insolence like thine. [Exit. Sir J. Eternal ruin seize the Queen and thee, And all the Confounded Syren Sex; how many Hells Within this Bosom reign? slighted Love, Revenge, Rage, Spite, Envy and Ambition; Sure the damn'd medley must at least produce A perfect madness. Oh! that as my will To mischief rises, so my power might; That I could let the Furies loose, and ravage All the World. 'Tis Clarence holds her heart, but Gloucester will Assist, and 'spite of all their fondness blast their Loves, rather than they shou'd meet. Let ruin thro' the face of Nature range, And all things suffer a Destructive Change; When in that Chaos all mankind shall lie, There'll not be found a wretch so curst as I. [Exit. SCENE, A Grove. Enter Clarence, and Malavill. Clar. With much a-do, I've broke from faithful Warwick, Who prest me hard to know my fatal sorrows. This the hour, and this the place, In which I met my Heavenly Isabella: Let my ambitious Brothers waste their time, In climbing up the Royal precipice; Let Casuists argue the injustice of the War, Whilst I retiring from the bustling Crowd, Find my sure bliss in Isabella's eyes; See! where the brightness darts thro' yonder shades; So Cynthia lookt, when in Lathmo's Cave She nightly met Endymion. Oh no! My Isabella's Beauty will surmount all poets Rapture. Enter Isabella and her Woman. O thou balm of Comfort! Soul of sweetness! Look on me, shoot thy Beams into my bosom, Talk to me, Charm me into Ecstasie, for Heaven is my Witness, I never think of Joys But in thy Presence? Isa. O Clarence! the gloomy Stars that rule our fates Were never sure for Conjunction made; Distant, alas! and wide they dart their angry Rays; And seem to threaten everlasting separation. Clar. At such a thought I'd curse them from their Spheres. They now are kind, Oh! may my fair one prove so too. Then this very night they light me on To endless Worlds of bliss. Isa. What means my Lord? Clar. Have I been only flatter'd with what alone My youth has gloried in; or may I trust The trembling tender accents, that have whisper'd Thy heart, thy precious heart was mine? Isa. When first the Queen bid me look on you As my destin'd Lord, I thought 'twas duty Made me regard you, more than all mankind. But ah! too soon I found that Godlike form, And the respect you paid; which love alone produces, Had gain'd the ascendant o'er my Virgin wishes. If since my eyes have stray'd, or any object Brought to my thoughts, that offer'd to rebel Against the awfull power already there May Heaven, which knows the secrets of my Soul, Punish me with loss of you and Fame. Clar. Bend, ye Celestial Quire; bend down with me, And bless the Angel you have lent, for breathing Words like these, that tune and charm my Soul. By my hopes, were all the merits of our Race, Cramn'd into one, he durst not plead desert, A Beam of mercy, the least regard of pity, Pays an Age of Services. Oh! how wretched am I? Isa. Why, my dear Clarence! why does thy bosom heave With sighs, as the great heart within were rending? If I have any Charms, if I can please, Is not all the kindness of my eyes addrest to thee? Clar. Therefore, and only therefore do I curse My Fate, that being blest beyond what The most Ambitious cou'd have hop'd for, I yet have more, much more to ask. E'er my Request is told! Oh Isabella, Guess what's the Consequence; how it imports My Life, these Agonies will sure express. I who have stood pitch'd Battles without one Shock of Nature, now feel Convulsive tremblings Seize on every Nerve; nay, thus unmann'd, Behold me weeping at your feet. Isa. What can you who have so much Honour Fear to ask; or I, who have so much Love, Refuse to grant? My Lord, as your partial kindness Has set me nearer to your heart, than all the fairest Of your Sex, so wou'd I approve my faith Above the common rate, To justifie your choice; speak thou Conqueror, Propose the way, be it to strip me of these shining Ornaments, the Pride of Courts, and fly with thee To Caves, to Huts, and unfrequented shades, Most readily I will obey. Clar. Ha! didst thou say fly with me! By Heaven. 'Tis on that the weight of my Petition hangs. Can you, dare you, will you be so good, To trust this tender work of Heaven, this Matchless softness, never expos'd to ought less gentle, Than the breeze from flowers? Dare you with me, Venture tempestuous blasts, regardless Seas, And all the hazards of Incommodious flight? Isa. Yes! my dear Clarence; Love wou'd make me bold, Fill all my thoughts with thee, and dangers quite forgot, When thou art ne'er me; But oh! I have another tie, Duty, Friendship, Gratitude plants me here. The mourning Queen, whose adversity has shook off Fawning crowds, must not be left by Isabella. Clar. I'll not complain; or urge an Argument Against that good and all-deserving Queen. 'Tis true, big with my hopes, for what won't Love Prompt blooming youth to hope, I had prepar'd A Vessel for our Transportation into France; You, as a Branch of Burgundy, must needs Have found a noble welcome in that Court; And I, as Brother to great England's King Cou'd have made my own Conditions. Isa. England's King, my Lord, is not your Brother. Clar. Yes, faithfull charming Maid, he is, The People's hearts are his, the sickly Forces Of falling Henry, to morrows setting Sun In tombs: yet I wou'd fly from these flowing honours, Which must adorn our Family, and gazing Upon thee forget Ambition. Isa. What do you ask? to what do I incline? These may not be faithfull, the way, the method, All like Palaces in Fairy Land, Impracticable, and only built on fancy. Clar. If Love's your guide, the way is very easie, The secret door, you now have passed, you may As well command at twelve; there I will wait, Like the far travell'd Pilgrim, who knows no Peace Of mind, till the opening Temple shows the Saint, To whom his vows and oraisons are paid. Isa. Alas! I dare not tread those lonely paths, Thro' hollow Vaults and most horrid Windings, And at that dreadfull hour of Midnight; Clar. Give Malavill the outer Key, and we Will meet you in the upper Court, nay, fear Not, dearest, I know him well, born and bred Amongst us, try'd and faithful as a Brother. Isa. Yet Brothers may be false! O my divided Soul, Can I leave the dear indulgent Queen; O draw me, Heaven, thro' this Labyrinth! For Love and Friendship pull me several ways, Like Cords upon the Rack; which ever way I yield, No ease is granted to my troubled mind. Clar. Return! my soft beloved, Oh return! Hush thy anxious thoughts a sleep, and think Of me no more? Edward is indeed inveterate; And which way ever Victory inclines, we meet no more. Lead me, O Malavill! Lead me to the Battle. Fix me in the front, against the ablest Archers fix me; And let a thousand, thousand darts at once Pierce this fond heart, which pants in vain for Isabella. [Sinks on Malavill. Isa. Oh! my dear Lord! I'm not worthy half this passion, My Fear is vanish'd, and my Love is strong. Command me any thing, I will not raise Another doubt. Clar. Oh! thou all goodness! dearest, sweetest Creature! Once does wretched Clarence hold thee fast. Isa. Say, direct me how I shall proceed, for I will come. Clar. Wou't thou indeed? O! Charming Excellence; oh! all perfection, The blood that guards my heart leaps to my cheeks, Fires my eyes, which almost start with passion; And each crowding word to express my Joys, Grows thick upon my Tongue. Isa. Talk not so wildly, but instruct me in my flight? Clar. My life; give to Malavill the Key of that door, thro' which you past. Isa. I cannot yet, for that way Tudor enters to the Queen, Let him two hours hence beneath yon Eastern Tower Wait, and I will give it him: what ails me Clarence? Why do I tremble so? Clar. Oh! 'tis thy tender gentle nature, which frights Thy little frame, and makes thee shrink at what Thy love has promis'd; yet Isabella, By all my hopes, by the blest Saints, If Clarence lives, you shan't repent your kindness. Blast me with Lightning from yon Azure roof, Rivet me with sure fulfilling bolts, if time In all its Course Past or to Come, can ought more faithfull see. Isa. Or any Maid, who loves, and dares, like me. [Exeunt severally. SCENE the Camp. Enter King Edward, meeting Gloucester. Ed. What news, my careful Gloucester? Glou. Victory still attends the King; the very Scouts and Forragers Return, being flush'd and redned with Success. Edw. These are all steps to fix us on the Throne; But still the Root of Lancaster, and Branches too, Must be remov'd, least building o'er them We totter, and Clarence be ours or lost. Glou. Lost in death e're ruine us. Daring like yours In not proceeding does backward go; Fair Isabella consents to Clarence's Follies, And e're morning hopes to escape. Edw. That must be prevented. Glou. It shall, the Hammer's lifted here, and when It strikes, the work is finished. The night Under her Sable Wings shall hatch such deeds, Will fright the blushing dawn: Suppose Ludlow Castle yours, The Queen, on a pretext, that shall seem just, Remov'd, Tudor slain, either on his March, or else Within the Walls. Edw. Attempt both; they who wou'd succeed, must leave The least to Chance, and catch at every opportunity. Glou. This way Clarence moves, as Malavill informs me, Here I will stay and meet the fiery youth, Dash all his quiet with the Fiend Jealousie, Which Weed, Planted by a cunning hand, Will quickly grow in the warm soil of his Fierce passion, and even overshoot the love, Which he so long has cherish'd. Edw. Use him, dear Gloucester as his Folly has Deserv'd. Glou. What Paper's that? Edw. A Letter from the forsaken Eleonora. Glou. Leave it with me: I have a sudden Thought it may be usefull. Edw. Take it: thou art a perfect Chymist In extracting ruin. I dare trust all To thy management. (Exit. Glou. Here comes Natures other Favourite; Enter Clarence. 'Twas base, 'twas barbarous! the choicest Beauty of the Nation rifled, and then despis'd. (Looking upon the Letter. Clar. What means my Brother? Glou. Your Pardon, Duke of Clarence, I saw you not, Here's a melancholy complaint From the wretched Elenora. Clar. Her fate is hard, and much my temper Differs from the King's. Glou. That Sacred name raises him above Our Reprehension, tho' not to him, of him Who can forbear to speak; that has a Soul In which true honour has a Residence Has he not, like the wanton Summer fly, Blown upon and tainted all our Beauties? Is there a Maid of Quality or Fortune, Whom he has not attempted, or at least Married to some Favourite fawning Minion; While we the branches too of mighty York, Only are neglected? Clar. The Ladys Case transports you; were I dispos'd To marry, the King shou'd not chuse for me. Glou. My Lord, no choice is left, is there in all the Court, One of an unsullied fame, whose Beauty, or Whose Quality is fit for Princes Arms? Clar. I'll not dispute the matter, but I think there are. Glou. There are! you speak as if they abounded, Name me but one, and I'll recant in Veneration To such a rarity; forgive the rest, and touch Their fames no more. Clar. What think you then of beauteous Isabella? The studied Workmanship and hand of Heaven, Nothing can transcend her Divine person, But the unspotted Soul, that dwells within. Glou. What Isabella, Queen Catharine's Ward, Thyrrold's Isabella, is't she you thus extravagantly Describe. Clar. How Gloucester! now I have found thee subtle In malice, all the workings of thy brain Are like the dismal Policies of Hell; Which still produce a mischief. But do not mention her again! I charge thee do not: For by the sacred blood That fills her veins, the blood of Bedford and of Burgundy Both Royal Stems, you shall not dare? Glou. Not dare, Prince? Clar. No, not dare. Lay all your plots on me; Cover me all over with detraction, as with a Leprosie, But touch not Isabella; I will bear it. Glou. Go on, my Brother, and when your passion's o'er, Too late consider, if I've deserv'd this usage. Clar. What have I done! how came her name in Question? Oh! Gloucester, Gloucester! thou art deep and cunning, I but a shallow stream, and as I stand between, Shall be surely forded o'er; Edward and Gloucester both may take my life, But of my Love, there's neither shall deprive me. Glou. I knew not Isabella grew so near you. 'Twas common Fame occasion'd what I said, That as the Queen, descended to Love Tudor, So Isabella had made Thyrrold hers. Rumor's the Child of Error, if I've caught A Falshood, why shou'd that create a Quarrel. Clar. A Quarrel, there is none. The King and you Possess the glories you atchieve in War, My happiness lies in another Sphere. Farewell. [Exit. Glou. Happiness is a Rosie path you ne'er shall tread; The Hornet, I have thrown into your bosom, It buzzes now: But it shall sting anon. Dissimulation, thou art mine; My rage, was high as his, and spite much more: but dear dissimulation Cover'd all the fury of my Soul, and it shall be vented the safest way. Enter Malavill. Mal. I met the Duke, my master; methought his Looks were full of discontent. [Drum beats. Glou. I gave it him; hark, a distant Drum is the signal I order'd at the approach of Tudor: what, ho! Captain, Enter Captain. Is the detachment ready? Capt. My Lord, it is. Glou. Lead them towards the Castle, there as I told you you'll Meet with Tudor, when you encounter him, if his force, Is stronger than you expected, urge not too far, at night I shall use you, and those that you command. Capt. With utmost care your orders shall be obey'd. [Exit. Glou. Will Sir James Thyrrold come to the Appointed place? Mala. He will, and is impatient till he Knows your Grace's pleasure. Glou. Clarence is even to rashness brave, that Will make forget the nicer forms of Different Quality; after our Conference, See me again, if your Lord calls and seems uneasie, Cast forth doubtfull Words; if Jealousie Appears, feed it with oyl. I've Told the King thy merits of thy Intelligence And Honour waits to Crown thy Service. Mala. Thanks, noble Sir, your long tasted Bounty Secures me still your Slave, I'll to my Lord, And watch his every motion. [Exit Mala. Glou. Go thy ways, Traytor, that's thy proper name, Oh! there's a vile Ingredient in our frames; This Man my Brother Clarence ne'er did injure, But signalized him with marks of Friendship Above the rest, who did attend him. Yet, For a little Gold with eagerness he Seeks his ruin, an itching Palm destroys his Faith, Ambition conquers mine: Interest tempts all, and where she tempts, succeeds. My great designs, why shou'd I blush to own, There's no Temptation greater than a Crown. The End of the second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE Ludlow Castle. Enter Tudor and a Colonel. Tud. Cousin, how are ye? Col. Right well, my noble Friend. Tud. I did not here expect an Engagement. Col. You fought as if you did, your Courage And your Conduct both were shown; they That gave the Onset first, most shamefully Retreated. Tud. Colonel, lead your Forces to the Camp of Henry Or Margaret, I know not which to call it Before the mornings dawn I will be there. Col. Oh Tudor, thou noblest of mankind, Remember e'er I speak that your Commands I never disobey'd. Tud. Nor ever will, I hope, my Soldier and my Friend Col. No, tho' by this Ambush laid and your rash Resolve of seeing the Queen alone, I read, Oh dismal thought! your death. Tud. Be it so, draw off your Forces, I had rather See the Queen tho' my life's the forfeit, than Be Edward or Henry or any happier King That you can think of. If you out-live me, Report me as a Man that Catharine smil'd on; Let some kind Pen transmit the glory to Posterity, and I shall hold my death a prize too small for such a stock Of fame if you Love me, answer not, nor offer to disswade Me, but observe my orders, [Exit. Col. bowing. This is the path; Oh Angel Guardian be thou Near, and lead me to my heaven. (Exit. Enter Queen Catharine. Cat. I hear the doors unbar; shall I not go to Meet him; he comes, oh trembling heart Think of thy Woes and let thy pantings now be still. Enter Tudor and Isabella. Tud. (kneels.) My Queen? Cat. My Love, my Husband, rise my dearest Lord. Tud. Do I behold thy face again. Oh taste of joys Unatterabl? Oh Banquet beyond the power of sence to bear! Nor must I murmur now, If the hard conditions wherewith, Seemed to article with providence is now fullfill'd. For Heaven knows how often I have Wisht to see thy face, and die. Cat. Avert it Heaven; yet we meet indeed 'midst Wars and Tumults; Camps on either side; Frightfull Scenes for Love. Tud. All, all, is the milky way, when thou art near: Oh should I but repeat the miseries I have Indured, since banished from those fair Eyes, you sure wou'd pity me. Cat. What hast thou suffer'd? thou dear Innocence? Persued Tud. Upon the Barren summit of a Prodigious Mountain whose height seem'd to brave a second Flood, I pass'd my tedious hours, Stretching my longing Eyes towards the abode Of my fair Queen, and Courting the fierce winds That way to bear my sighs, sometimes farther urged By my despair upon the extreamest verge of ragged Cliffts that over look the deep, I'd throw my Wretched weight like one destracted, tell the Ever beating Waves my Grief, and fill the ambient Air with your dear name. If thunder grumbl'd o'er my head Or Earthquakes shook the frame beneath, By me the Warring Element was unobserv'd; My Love, my Joy, my Peace of mind was lost. My Queen was absent, and therefore I forsook All Comfort. Cat. Beds of Down and guilded roofs were a like, Uneasie, and without thee, food for desperation: And now 'tis but a kind of doubtfull day, Which only glimmers, and then will part Us with eternal night. Tud. Be that night eternal, no morrow grant. At least this night is ours. Cat. Flatter not thy self with hopes now, there is Nothing ours; yet you may remember; nay you must, It has been otherwise, Henry the First and Noblest Candidate for fame, once was yours and mine, My Lover, and your Royal Friend, yes you have Seen me Crown'd the Queen of Nations, Beheld my evening Pomp and morning Waiters, For you were still the earliest of the Crowd; At awfull distance watch'd the motions of my eyes, And trembled when you met a glance, Henry knew the Holy Fire, that warm'd your breast, Yet so well he knew both you and me, That he never frown'd on either: But encourag'd the Chast Friendship, Which when Heaven angry with this lower World Snatch'd hence its great protector grew to Love: Tud. Blest Hero! whom future Ages or their best Of future Kings can only hope to faintly Copy, Whom when I ever name without Just Veneration, May Cankers gnaw my ungratefull Tongue; Yet Friendship shall not rob my Love. No mighty Queen the first minute these tho', Then hopeless eyes, view'd that unimitable frame, They drew in Love, witness their divided lids Still stretch'd with endless wakings witness the Unbated sorrows; the returning years still found Me wrapt in, witness ten thousand racks. But why look I backwards, when I can call The Heaven mine for which I served? Yes, 'tis permitted, that I may approach. My Arms have licence to Circle thee, and snatch Thee to my heart, and hold a place in thine, A glory which I d not exchange to be The greatest titl'd Slave the busie Globe contains. Cat. Oh Tudor, Tudor, sure thy Mothers blessings, And her beauty, and her softness, hangs about thee, The rest of humane Race all seem rugged, Thou only art the Child of Love, the pattern Made for Poets to form their Hero's by. Tud. The kindness of these Words, nothing but Ecstatick bliss, nothing but Joys this night Will bring, can raise me higher, Cat. My fears distract me, you are a Foe Proclaimed, shou'd there be Information Given, Courts have many spies, the Castle Is unguarded, let not thy valiant Soul and Over eager Love, tempt thee to so imminent A danger; tho' yet thy Arm well us'd to Conquest, Prompts thee on, think, alass, my Tudor, Multitudes o'ercome the bravest Sword. Tud. Shall apprehension, the Cowards check, fright Me, from my fair Level not a Man who has Aspired and possessed the greatest Queen on Earth, so low in your esteem, that imaginary Fears, shou'd tear me hence, the Niggard Heavens allow us but the present hours, the Future still are left to doubtfull Fate. Oh! Lovely Catharine, if I read in thy looks some Beamy signs of Joy, as sure I can, for I Understand 'em well, bless me with kindness, Talk no more of danger, let us dream at Least this Castle's safety ours; indulge the Pleasing ecstasie, nor wake, till we are Forced to wake. Cat. She that can love and can deny must not Have a heart like mine. Isa. Oh! Tud. Blest sound! Cat. My Isabella I heard the sad murmur of a Stifled sigh, my ear catched the broken Sadness. Tudor, behold your fair guide as the Dearest object of my Friendship; nay she Almost Rivals you. The kindest maid, the Truest creature, Companion in all my solitudes, Forsaking the allurements the tempting Pleasures which her charming youth and Vast fortunes might have commanded, still Has she follow'd my retirement: and with Her Innocence and Goodness cheared me. Tud. For such a faithfull care, may That power to whom we pray, reward her Equal to my wish, continue still that beauteous Loveliness, Crown her with happiness lasting As her self can wish. Isa. My Noble Lord, cover me not With blushes? Why, Royal Madam, Did ye speak those Balmy words, they wound my heart, your kindness Like descending Angels on the impure, Strikes me with death. Tud. What means the Charmer? Cat. My Lord, she's sick of our disease, in love, And now by my commands I hope is Strugling with her yielding heart, within Ill tell ye all the unhappy Circumstances. Tud. Peace to her mind, and may she ever Vanquish all that wou'd disturb her, my Queen are the tender pledges of our love, The beauteous-little-ones for beauteous they Are, cause Images of thee, are they here. Cat. My Cherubs, my Comforts, cou'd they be from Me never, I'll lead you to 'em, dear Isabella, give Thyrrold strict charge to be Carefull in his watch, then attend me in the Bed-Chamber. Tud. Give me thy hand. And as this touch does all my racks remove, So may thy fears, and think of nought but Love. (Exit Queen led by Tud. Isa. What must I think on? doubting, and the Dreadfull expectation of what's to come, Are terrors that create despair, and such a State is mine. Oh fairest, best of Queens! Can you not find in my disordered looks, The tumults of my Soul, and Chain me Near ye? Enter her Woman. Wom. Madam, Malavill waits without. Isa. Let him wait a little longer, my Esperanza, What have we promised, dost thou not fear? Wom. For you alone, I alas, am worthless! Isa, Oh happy! happy thou. If you consented to Some honest mate and fled, no Court wou'd Be allarm'd, no Pursuers, no life be lost. Where shall I unbosom my full heart, what Kind adviser help my youth, I have no friend, I never had but one, the unequall'd Queen, And she I am flying from. Wom. To meet a Faithfull Friend, a Noble Husband. Isa. So I hope, but oh I dare not look with reason's Eye into this mad attempt; love hurries me Along, and love they say is a blind guide; if Margaret, if Catharine, or if Edward seize us, Away, I will not thing so deeply, fasten that Door, least from the Castle we are surprized, And call Malavill in. [Exit Wom. Now 'tis better in my tormented breast, the Scene is changed, and Clarence stands in my Minds view, all faithful, lovely, and beloved. Oh, Haste thee to my Royal Youth, and chase these Melancholy fears away. Re-enter her Woman with Malavill. Mala. My Lord watches the minutes with an impatient Lovers haste, numbers 'em with his sighs, till the Blest one arrives, till I return and more confirm His expected Joys. Isa. Malavill, 'tis a dangerous path we tread, and much Precaution must be used, if amongst those few, Your master trusts but one, shou'd prove a Traytor Inevitable ruin seizes all. Mala. I dare affirm the care the Duke has took in what So nearly does concern him, equals his Love, which nothing Can exceed, the rest are managed well, I only know The bottom of the design, and shou'd I Be thought unfaithfull, I soon wou'd give a fatal Proof of my Fidelity, and die at hearing I was Once mistrusted. Isa. No, be assured thou art not, if thou wert by Isabella, I'd stand the lash of Furies, have Uninvented torments practised on this tender Body, excelling all the old, e'er groan the secret Out this night. On Dacres absence I know the Queen Will walk her self the rounds, see every door and Brazen gate fast barr'd and lock'd, and every Key Brought to the Royal Chamber, this only passage Left to trusted me, and therefore unexamined shall I then dare? Oh horror, every limb and every Trembling vein forbids it. Mal. What, not for the Duke of Clarence, not for him Who wou'd rush thro' thousand pointed Swords For you. Isa. Take it, take the important Key. The Queens own wordsâ But fly this moment, fly, be gone I say, least I Repent and yield no more. Mala. With all my heart. (Aside.) At twelve? Isa. I will. [Exit Ma. Hear thou All-seeing eye of Providence, listen to (kneeling. A distressed Virgins Prayer, if ought that's ill insues For much my heart forbodes; as mine the guilt, be mine the punishment. If there must be wrath, heap it all on me, But let the guiltless Queen be safe and free. [Exeunt. SCENE, the Camp. Enter Duke of Clarence, followed by the Earl of Warwick. Warw. Hold, Duke of Clarence stop, thus have I Followed thee beyond our utmost Guards, Thus beheld thee, observ'd thy folded arms, And down cast eyes, thy silent steps I've traced, Which seem'd to measure out thy graves Length, so sad they were come, dear youth, Lean upon my bosom and tell thy griefs, if thou Art wronged, Warwick stands forth to do thee Justice, I serve the King thy Brother Edward, But dare Proclaim before his face I love thee More. Clar. Burden me not with kindness. To noble natures 'Tis the hardest task, favours receiving without Hopes of a return. Edward and Gloucester, the darlings, Both of Fate; to them apply and court not him, Who shuns the World. War. Dost thou push me from thee, young Prince; Boy, I was a going to have said, you will repent It; there's something labours in thy brain Remember you were offered Warwick's aid, which You despis'd, Farewell. (Exit War. Clar. He's gone, and I dare not call him back or tell My weakness; he never will consent, his Souls wound Up to steady Glory, past the Convulsive fit of Loves dear Calenture, what he terms sadness Is the expected Joy which fills my Soul with transports. My thoughts are full of thee, dear Isabella, And my eyes disdain to view an object that may Divert the pleasing Image, where art thou? Malavill, lazy Embassador for Love, hast to bring Me the glad tidings all goes well. Enter a Page. Pag. Sir, Sir? Clar. What's the matter, boy? Pag. A grim looked fellow, game me this, and charged Me instantly to seek ye, nor wou'd he leave me Till he saw I'd found your Grace. I knew my Gallant Master wou'd have been angry, if I Had trembled else indeed he frighted me. Clar. Poor innocence! ha, lift up thy Torch sure the Moon gives me a sickly light and make me, Read a miss. [Reads.] Duke of Clarence. Your Family is given to invade another's right. You a younger branch, follow the Example: Witness, your designs on Isabella, my plighted Wife. (Ha, my blood runs cold, but I will yet proceed) Since you have chose the Murderers hour, as that perjur'd false one has confessed, be that the place and time, if you dare to meet the Injured Thyrrold. If I dare, where am I, can this be true, or is it all A plot too deep for me to fathom; Isabella false, I'll Not believe it, sure 'tis all delusion. Enter Malavill. Oh, art thou come, let me rush upon thee, as I Would seize my Love, thou art arriv'd the very Minute when I was plunging down I know not where, You must awake me from a dreadfull dream, For sure it is no more? Mal. My Lord! Clar. Shrink not from my embrace, nor turn thy eyes Away, I cannot bear another apprehension if thou Bringst not comfort. Hell, all hell is here. Mal. What shou'd I say? Clar. Why, hast thou nothing then to say, did I not Send thee? Mal. You did, my Lord. Clar. Why are thy answers cold and looks distracted? Did I not send thee to Isabella, for the Confirmation Of her promise, and the Key? Mal. You did, but oh! Clar. What? speak I charge thee, speak. Mal. After long waiting and repeated signs, the Necessary thing her Woman appear'd, and with A scornfull smile, said we were all defeated: Sir James Thyrrold had discover'd our design, and Isabella in a careless tone, she added, was concern'd, But advised your Grace to think of her no more. Clar. By hell 'tis false, she is betrayed as well as-I, Her Soul is written in her looks, and does not Know deceit. Mal. Take my life, if you suspect me, go the Appointed place I'll wait upon you, Affronted and vexed like you. Clar. Forgive me, dear Malavill, what, no Key? No word from her. Mal. None, as I hope for everlasting happiness. Clar. Then she isâhold my breath shall not proclaim Her, nor will I curse her, nor wish her half, The racks that she has given me; follow to My Tent, I have yet an Assignation left, which Shall be this night in Blood performed: Oh Isabella, Who wou'd have thought, when Heaven had took Such pains, without Hell had been employed So deep within. Fool! fool, too soon believing, I'm undone Nor has the Trayt'ress by deceiving won. For whom soe'er, false Saint, bows to thee, There's not a Worshiper will dote like me. [Exit. Enter Duke of Gloucester. Glou. Ha, ha, ha, this will do him good; whet his Spleen, and make a perfect Soldier of him. Had The Man been married, he had been spoiled. Mal. Your Grace is pleased, but shou'd my Lord and Isabella meet, or the King incline to the match; I of necessity must be crusht as an atonement, For the reconciliation. Glou. Hitherto thou hast acted well, doubting will Undo thee. No, Clarence and Isabella meet no more Like Lovers, on the word of Gloucester, be directed, And search no further, tread the way that I show Thee, which shall lead to thy advancement. Mal. Too far I've ventured now to think of a return. Glou. Where's the Key that to the Castle gives the Wish'd admittance? Mal. There 'tis: had you but seen with what fear, What trembling 'twas given, heard the prayers The piercing words, the frighted Virgin used, 'Twou'd sure have shock'd ye. Glou. No, I shou'd have laughed at the deluded Maid. Does your Master wear to day the Sword I gave you? Mal. My Lord, you know he does? Glou. 'Tis well that Sword is temper'd, as I wou'd ever Wish my foes, for at the first meeting Clash It breaks, six of my Voluntiers will seize Him; men not unused to practices like those. In vain he'll call himself Clarence, in vain Endeavour to convince 'em for they are Well prepar'd, and without my orders, won't Release him. When this is done, leave you the Duke, the King shall both protect and reward you. Mal. As my diligence shall merit, I ask no more. [Exit Mal. Glou. Thy merit's death, and thou shalt find it, fool; Thy sting, thy venoms gone, thou hast done Thy best. And the Voluntiers That seize the Prince, have orders to stop Thy craving mouth. Clarence too soon will know thee, Now therefore thou art useless. Enter at rising Ground King Edward. Edw. Speak, Gloucester, shall haughty Catharine Mourn this Night. Glou. She shall, if Tudor's blood can make Her weep. Here's the Key, wait the Signal, and prepare to glut your Eyes. Edw. Oh let me hug thee close; I feel a Warm Vengeance rise, and joys fierce As is fruition, fill the big heart, which That ungrateful fair despised. 'Tis grown A Rambler now, and can be pleas'd On easier terms than dying. Yet I will see again those Charming eyes, But all their tears and menaces despise, And laugh at Catharine, when her Tudor dies. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Fourth. SCENE the Castle. Enter Duke of Clarence, and Malavill. Clar. Here did I expectâoh what I did not expect Even all the happiness my heart is fond off. Cruel disappointment; yet 'tis but just; When man gives up his Noble Charter, his Reason, And is passions Slave, he shou'd be used so: Oh, Malavill, cou'dst thou believe such falshhood Were in Womankind, Mal. Most easily, my Lord, 'tis the common practice, Had she proved true, that had been the wonder. Clar. Is't possible. Isabella was my first and only Love Pure were my flames, and my desires unfeign'd Her returns I thought full of artless Innocence, When in her Charming eyes I first read kindness, If I catch'd a dear relenting glance, How modestly she wou'd decline 'em; Her lovely face cover'd with Virmilion blushes: Nay, the tears wou'd follow. Cou'd this all be deceit? Cou'd she weep and vow and look, such thingsâ And yet dissemble still. Mal. 'Tis natural to the Sex. Clar. And is that dear false hand given to Thyrrold? His plighted Wife! Racks, Wheels, and Gibbets, Sword and fire, can their torments equal That curst thought; yet when I reflect on this Unexampled Treachery, methinks 'tis strange The story most improbable, 'tis but some few hours A go that fair one gave me all the tendrest Marks of love and kindest promises; what cou'd Tempt her to draw me on so far? Mal. I like not this. [Aside. Clar. But then how shou'd Thyrrold know of our Intended flight, unless thou hast proved The smooth fac'd Villain, and betray'd me. Mal. If you mistrust me, use your Sword, Wound me not with your unkind suspicions: Tardy Duke of Gloucester, I shall be ruin'd. [Aside. Clar. I know not what to think, but shou'd I find Thou hast wronged me in the tendrest part, The blessing of my Life, my Love, my Isabella, I cannot name her but my heart will rise: Oh, cruel Charmer think not to 'scape my Vengeance, For tho' the King shou'd Guard thee, through His heart I'd reach at thine, seize thee Like a loosen'd Fury, and shake thee into Atoms. Thyrrold above. Thyr. What mad man's this, that raves beneath our Walls. Clar. Traytor, come down and see. Thyr. I wou'd, but for commands which I have sworn to obey. Clar. What commands shifting Coward? Thyr. Fair Isabella has hung about my neck, Used such prevailing arts of fondness, Beg'd with such a grace, and so much power, That I have forgiven both her and you. Clar. Ye raging Fires, eat, eat my heart; burn inwards, But burst not forth, I wo'not answer like a Woman, With my Tongue alone, but Thyrrold, he assur'd I shall find thee: yes, hadst thou Gyants For thy Guard, wert thou hem'd with Devils I'd Grapple with thee, and sink thee too: Remember that, and tremble. Thyr. If I tremble it must be with delight, To Isabella's Bed I am going, the Priest Has made us one, there the soft, the melter, The expecting fair one lies, think you on that, And mangle thy own flesh. In distraction thy wretched bosom tear, Reflect upon my joys, and then despair. [Exit Thyrrold. Clar. Curses, curses! Oh Malavill, in thy bosom Hide me, for if I look that way my eyes will burst. Enter three or four Villains. 1 Vill. Yonder he stands, we may seize his Sword E'er he perceive us. [Snatches his Sword from him. Clar. Villains what mean ye? Malavill, give me thy Sword, and get behind me. Mal. No, I'll defend your life. 1 Vill. Fool, thou canst not save thy own. (stabs him, he falls. Mal. Oh pardon me noble Sir you are betray'd and so Am I, the Lady Isabella isâ [dies. Clar. What, go on, speak but that word, that syllable either False or True, and I'll forgive thee all; 'tis lost in death. 1 Vill. You must with us. Clar. Slaves, do you know to whom you speak? 1 Vill. Our orders are to force you, if you resist. Clar. Unhand me, Dogs, I am the Duke of Clarence. 1 Vill. No matter who you are, you are our Prisoner now. Clar. Slaves, Villains, Murderers. [Exit forc'd off. SCENE the inside of the Castle. A Toylet. Enter Isabella, and Esperanza. Isa. Methinks I tread these Royal Rooms, as bodies Summon'd to the Grave, take their last melancholy Rounds, and sadly traverse o'er and o'er the places that They best have loved; Oh love are all that bend beneath Thy weight, oppress'd like me? no, 'tis impossible. Then humane kind wou'd throw thy bondage off, But alas, thy crowds of Votaries are Rovers all, Play with desire, catch'd at the eyes, and changed Without a pang; 'tis not, my Clarence, so with us, The link of Souls has fixt our meeting Passions, I hope beyond the power of Fate to break; By yon lifted tapers Show the Queen is coming, Be gone, my Esperanza, get our disguises ready, And wait me at the outer Court. Esper. Madam, I will. Isa. See where they come, Tudor and the Queen, Arm in arm they walk; Love takes up [Exit Es. Every thought and every wish: Nor cou'd those Majestick eyes of Catharine Express more pleasure, more satisfaction, When she beheld a Thousand ready slaves, Who watch'd each motion and fled to execute E'er she cou'd speak her will; this proves Possessing the dear object that's beloved, Superiour to ambition, a sublimer Joy, And Clarence, shall not thou and I, be thus happy? Yes, if in France they give us but an humble Vineyard joyn'd with a lovely Cottage, there won't Thou meet me with such desiring eyes, there Shall I forget the bustle of the great, and in thy Faithfull arms taste balmy slumbers, which the Busie Statesman, and the fair false one Never knows. Enter Queen Catharine, Owen Tudor in a Night gown, Ladies of Honour. She comes! Oh let me gaze eagerly, as the Transported Tudor, for Heaven only knows, when I Shall behold that dear, that lovely form again. Tud. Haste, ye officious Virgins! haste Off with all these useless shining Ornaments, give her to My longings: Oh, fairest Catharine, leave to thy Wanton Sex the care of dress, let them use Art And Skill, labour hard to make a little Conquest. Thy eyes will do the work alone, the Indian sweets, And Aromatick Gums be theirs, thy rosie breath, Out vie's 'em all. Cat. Oh, how long is it since my ears have drank such Accents, I cannot chide thy flatteries, cause 'tis Loves excess? A Chair their for my Lord. (Sits down. Tud. No, here at thy feet, grasping thy knees a happiness For which I've courted every Power, which day and Night has heard me beg of thee; at length Relenting Heavensâ Cat. Does Heaven relent, my Tudor! Oh no, that Hope's too full of blessings; if Heaven were reconciled, Then we shou'd meet to part no more. Tud. Why have ye damp'd my rising Joys with the Detested thought of parting; ye all righteous Powers, if we must part again, if my fond Eyes Must be snatched from what they dote on, and Condemn'd to view objects which they hate, Grant, grant this milder doom, close 'em in the night Of death, least returning back to my despair, I Curse that Providence I wou'd revere. Cat. Hard Fate of greatness, as if it were the Foe And opposite to love, rarely descends, but brings a train Of mischiefs. Tud. Yet, 'tis a glorious ruin thus to hover o'er my Queen, to breath my Vows upon her Sacred bosom, Tho' this breath were now my last, is happier far Than to have lived a long insipid Age with some Ignoble Fair One: taste of such Seraphick bliss; is Worth the exchange of Nestor's years. Cat. This is too much, my Tador, that soft maid just in the bloom Of Beauty might excuse a Lover's talking so, I Must not hear extravagance like this. Isa. aside.] The dreadfull hour approaches, uninterrupted time Has measur'd half its minutes and oh my Coward Heart beats faster than the warning Clocks. Tud. Ye all are triflers, And not consider the impaciency of my desires, nor the Cruel Fate, which bounds my wishes and will bring my Foe the morning e'er I have whisper'd half the story Of my Love. Cat. Fie, my Lord, my Isabella help me here! ha thy Hands are cold upon me, thou tremblest too, see. Tudor, see, my beauteous charge looks pale? Speak! what ails my choicest care. Isa. Something cold and shuddering, like what We apprehend of death has seized me, permit Me, Madam, to retire, I shall soon recover, but if I Do not, if I die or ought that's worse befall, Upon my knees I beg a kind remembrace. Cat. Alas, she is much disorder'd, lead her in; with richest Cordials revive her sinking spirits, and bring me Instant word. Isa. Oh love! oh fate! Oh Queen belov'd; which shall I Follow? direct me, Heaven. [Exit Isa. led off. Cat. Her words disjoynted are, yet sure there's meaning in 'em. Tud. No more, my Queen, than what the story Of her love allows. Cat. Forgive my superstition, if I say I think it ominous; My Isabella sickens when my Joys are fullest in Seeing you again. Tud. I have all my heart can wish, without a further Thought. My Heaven is here. Cat. Ha! methinks I see a bloody hand that parts Our meeting arms; it points towards thee, and seems to Rain a shower of blood upon us. Turn towards me, Thou fatal Fantom; on this devoted head, let the Dreadfull omen fall, but spare! oh spare my Tudor! Tud. My Queen, my Love, my Life, do with me what you will, From the highest Turret hurl me down: stab your Adorer, rather than let me hear you talk as if Depriv'd of reason. Cat. Did you not see nothing then! Oh what was it! of what, Was the sad Idea made! that got between my eyes and your Lov'd form? Tud. Hide thy fears within these faithfull arms, which long to Clasp thee; turn thy bright eyes into my heart: Oh! that you cou'd, there, wou'd you behold your own Loved Image, sitting Triumphant o'er every thought, And ruler of each wish. Cat. Still do I tremble and feel a terror o'er my spirits, to which I cannot give a name. Prithee do not Judge unkindly Of my weakness. Tud. No, I must bless your tender care, but sure were your Breast as full of Love as mine, there cou'd not be a Room for any other passion. Enter Esperanza. Esp. Murder! murder! I'm pursu'd by Men or Monsters Of the night, which from the Vault arise, and Follow me with fury. Cat. Then we are lost, this door's too weak resistance. (Fastens the door. Tud. Surpriz'd, unarm'd! Oh for a Sword. Cat. Step, my dearest Lord, into this Closet, whilst I Meet these bold Invaders, there may be power in Injur'd Majesty, to stop their Insolence. Tud. What, must I be hid like a midnight thief, or Pale Adulterer; no, no, my Queen? rather let me plant My naked breast against this pass, and die defending it. (A noise. Cat. They come. I conjure thee, Tudor, By honour, by love, by whatever thou holdest dear, By my desires, which still were sacred, enter here. Tud. I will obey, tho' I am convinc'd, 'tis not evading my Fate, but receiving the death they bring, a baser Way, as if I fear'd it. (Exit into the Closet. A noise without. Glou. Break down the door. We must have entrance. Cat. Help there! ring the alarm Bell: I am beset. It must be Villains, some robbers of the Camp for Plunder, who, notwithstanding the General's grant for Peace, disturb my rest, and fright me to destraction, Ring out the Alarm Bell: Thyrrold, where are ye? Glou. (without.) We are your Friends, The King is here, open the door, Else we shall break it; if you talk of Peace, give Not cause for Violation; Thyrrold is with us, and all That he commands. Cat. Then opposition is in vain? Enter Edward, Duke of Gloucester, Sir James Thyrrold and Officers. Cat. Ha! is this the Courage the Plantagenets pretend to, Making War on Women, attacking a defenceless Queen Whom their own promises, if they were binding, Had secur'd? Edw. You first broke the Articles by sending succors To your Son, and by harbouring Traytors proclaim'd. Cat. Sure till you enter'd, these Walls held none, Unless 'twere he which trembles there behind. (Pointing to Thyrrold. Edw. He has done his duty: Catharine, in vain you dress your face in frowns, Those imperious looks are unregarded now, there Was a time: yes, shame to my weakness, there was A time when half that rigour cou'd have struck Me groveling to the Earth, like one fell'd by the Almighty Thunderer, crawling in dust, unable to Resist, but thanks to my kinder Stars, 'tis past: the Giddy Wheel has gone its round, and terror on this Brow alone's to be observ'd: Brother, proceed you In the search, Cat. He shall not dare, by my great Henry's Soul, whose Little finger wou'd have tumbled your aspirings Down, and crusht ye into nothing, he shall not dare. Glou. What has the Lyon cast his Skin? is Tudor Cramm'd shaking in some close corner, and left the Queen to Brave us? Come, fellow Soldiers, we'll seek this Lurking Rebel, drag him from the hole, whither His fears have led him, and take his forfeit Head, for coming where all our Laws deny'd him. Enter Tudor. Tud. No, be thine the fears as thine's the guilt, as Thine's the name of Rebell, this honest loyal Heart defies thy malice. Cat. Away, away, my Tudor: hold, cruel Gloucester Hold? Enter Isabella. Isa. Stand off! and let me pass, what mischief's acting Here; has Clarence done this, and am I the cause? Glou. Ha, another Fury! take her, Thyrrold, to thy dispose, She's wholly givenâyou know the rest; leave not a Rival room to hope, least this opportunity proves Thy last. Isa. Touch me not, Monster. What have I done? if I Am guilty, let the injur'd Queen punish me, let her Spurn me, trample on me, print me with a Thousand wounds, I'll not complain. Thyr. You shall have no reason, Madam, but you Must retire, 'tis the command of him, who now Is master here. Isa. I will not, Sir; oh save me, Royal Madam, from The cruel hands of these inhumane Men. Glou. Force her hence, we other business have than to Mind her foolish fears. Isa. Help heav'n, if the Queen denies, help thou my Weakness? help! Oh help! (Exit forc'd off, with Thyr. Cat. Alas, distracted wretch, but Why name I her, when all my life holds dear is On the brink of ruin? Tud. Speak, Edward, what is my doom, dauntless, I Expect it, I wou'd have met thee fairly in the field, body to Body, arm'd with Sword and Justice, but I suppose You lik'd not that, therefore now what you please. Edw. Audacious Tudor, thou threaten! condemn'd for Thy Ambition, thy haughty love is adjudged a Treason Capital, even that Puny King Henry, whom thou Pretendest to serve, he had courage to Sentence thee: Seize him, Captain, Command his head be strucken Off, and fixt upon the Castle Wall. Cat. Thro' this bosom, whosoe'er comes on: am I not Daughter of France and England's Queen? have I no Power? where are my Guards? Alas, I had forgot, I've None. Tud. Disturb not thus the quiet of thy Soul, my everlasting Charmer? Thy sorrows rack me more than all their Rage: Come, whither am I to be led. Cat. Oh, Tudor! glory, disdain, and pomp are mine No more, yet thou art mine, thou art yet alive, and for That precious life I will renounce the former; yes, Edward, I read the sullen pride that fills thy eyes, And gathers on thy brow. Glut thee this way, behold That Queen, who shook thee with a nod fall thus, Thy suppliant. [kneels. Edw. And at this sight, may Heaven and Earth be Witness, oh Gloucester! well hast thou fulfil'd thy word. Not all the Crowns ambition covets, England and France, the noblest Diadems, can please like this: Thus did I kneel, and thus was I repuls'd; and oh fair Queen, if I have lost my Soul for want of pity, His life is poor amends. Cat. Sure there is something in thee like the mixture Of a God and Devil. I cannot beg, my heart's above it: Yet spare him Edward, for thy future fame. Tud. Oh torture, not to be endur'd, my life ask'd Of him, him whose life I did command. Edw. Ha! Cat. Oh stop, bend to hard necessity, thy words have Given him new rage, canst thou behold these Low submissions for thy sake, and frustrate all their Power? Glou. You do indeed submit below your Character To save your wanton choise, the Idol of your Lust. Tud. Villain, I'll tear out that Blasphemous tongue, That has prophan'd a Chastity Thy Mother never knew. [Flies at Gloucester. Glou. I always go prepar'd for such a hug, lie there Presuming wretch. (Stabs him, Tud. falls. Cat. Wither the arm, that arm that gave the blow: Curst be my Female weakness too that cou'd not save him. Oh fatal aim, speak to me once again. (sinks upon Tud. Edw. Look to the Queen? Gloucester, thou hast done as men in power wou'd wish, A cruel necessary act without the bidding, Yet help me, Brother, for thou I find art steady, And tenderness struggles with revenge: Oh, the Uncertainty of humane passion, for Catharine I Wou'd once have died, yet now have given her Sorrows severer much than death. Cat. Ha! who have we here, my Tudor bleeding, These bubling wounds are none of thine, If they are, give 'em to me, I feel 'em at my heart. Tud. My paradise on earth, farewell: Have patience, Live for their dear sakes I leave behind, My Children? Oh farewell? (dies. Cat. No, we won't part so soon, On these pale lips, I will for ever, ever lie. Edw. The sight stupifies my senses: Let's to the field, there in the clank of Swords I will forget this private murder, For sure it cannot bear a better name. Glou. Yes, as I shall order it, when the day is ours, Which is now undoubted, his death breaks their Forces, Missing their Leader, his Troops dismaid prove useless, After Conquest it shall be given out, That he was taken and beheaded: Victory And Success will stop the mouth of unnecessary truth, And leave the following Age in doubt. Edw. Captain, let the Trumpets sound, Wake every Soldier with the voice of Battle, For as the Sun must rise in blood, so shall His evening be, and he shall shine no more, Till he beholds no Rival in the British Throne: Gloucester, dispose of Tudor as you please, But to the Queen offer no violence. Oh Catharine! Oh fatal Beauty, what ruins Thy Love has made. (Exit Edw. Cat. Ha, who said that if I am curst in Love, I'll try to thrive in hate, to thrive in curses; Curst be Edward? Curst be all his Race, let 'em, Prometheus like, have their own bowels torn, For they have prey'd upon my heart. Glou. Have comfort, Madam. Cat. Comfort! yes, from thy bloody hand I wou'd Receive it? Daggers, Sword, and Poyson, are the only Comforts thou canst give or I desire. Henry And Tudor both the rich prizes now of death, Then why am I spared: come on thou Murderer, Strike this swelling bosom, and let me mount to My Immortal Heroes; see where my Tudor rises On a Fleecy Cloud, all Crown'd with Radiant light: Oh take me with thee! he ascends A pace, I cannot reach him, I'll tear this Clog Of flesh off: bear me, ye Whirlwinds near him. Vain delusive joy, cold and bleeding at my feet, The dear one lies. Oh, my sick brain! Glou. Sleep will give you ease: Here, Soldiers, carry This body to the outer Court, from his dead trunk Severe his head; think it not cruelty, For he feels no further pain. Cat. Ha! must he not be buried then, but mangled More, yes he shall, I'll hide him, I'll scrape the Earth up But I'll find a Grave; Receive him common Parent, Receive him at my call. Glou. Divide her from his Body. Cat. No, never! never! hear me, Gloucester! I will help thy invention, mend thy bloody purpose: Cut off my living limbs, mingle 'em with his, Throw upon us molten Lead, and Seas of liquid fires, But divide us now no more. Glou. Haste, ye sluggards, [Drag Tudor out, the Queen falls at the door. Gently raise the Queen, And in some other apartment let her be confin'd. This was a shock indeed; but this o'ercome Points out lost Henry's succeeding doom. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Fifth. The Trumpets play an overture of Victory: Then Enter King Edward, Duke of Gloucester, Warwick, and Lords; Lord Dacres, and several other Prisoners. Edw. 'Tis done, the business of the War is done. The House of Lancaster has yielded back, The honours unjustly they usurp'd in storms, The Red Rose folds up her silken leaves, And sinks beneath a Sea of blood; from whence Our's the White emblem of Peace arises, And shall bless the Land with plenty; henceforth English Swords shall be no more sheathed In English bosoms: in Foreign Lands we'll search For new Acquests of Glory, for when our native Earth is reduced with the Blood of those we Call our Foes; we must blush to think They shou'd have been our Brethren. Warw. Then after Conquest let 'em be so received, To shew the War was just, shun cruelty. Edw. Far be it from my Nature, or if it were, I wou'd submit to you, the mighty Warwick; Whose very name brought Victory, whose Sword Has led me on to all the Honours I have won. Warw. I am not used to flatter, yet must say, A thousand eyes can witness that you fought Almost beyond the power of Man, Nor did your Brothers lag behind; thrice did I Follow Clarence's rash inadvertency, Which plung'd him headlong midst their thickest Troops, Yet the bold youth despis'd my aid, And with deaths a round him clear'd his way. Glou. I gave that fury to his arm, When the imprison'd Lyon was let loose, And told that Thyrrold was amongst our Foes. Warw. Why does he shun the glory's of this day, And having shar'd the danger, refuse the Triumphs, Which are to his valour due? Edw. That's a melancholy story, But time will wean him of his follies: My Lord Dacres, I think you've long been Chamberlain to the late Queen, Catharine I mean. Dac. I have, And wish more to express my Loyalty, My blood was mingled with theirs whose brave Souls, Now are mounted upwards, tho' their bodies Lie weltring on the plain. Edw. Only do me Justice in your Reports, And take your Liberty, hast to your afflicted Queen: And tell her, Revenge, the insatiable Monster, Now is gorg'd, and shall towards her for ever sleepe Where e'er she chooses, there uninterrupted, And in Peace she shall remain. Dac. I wou'd not, King, (For that title now thou hast purchas'd) Take a favour where I never mean to make returns: Yet thus far my Age and Sorrows force me To promise, no more to lift a Sword against thee; I've seen the ruin of my Royal master's Race, And in some Cell I'll not repine at thee, But mourn their hard fate for ever. (Exit Da. Edw. A truly honest man: Nor wou'd power or perswasion bend him; Loyalty is like Religion, that we suck in first, Tho' with the strongest Arguments assail'd, Most hardly is remov'd, on the Prisoners In the List, see execution done, The rest be guarded with effectual care, Now let the sound of Victory fore-run us, To every Quarter of the Camp, whilst we Receive our well deserving Soldiers, With Praise and Love. [The Trumpets sound again. Exeunt. Manent Gloucester, and a Servant. Glou. Thus far we have done well; the Clouds are Vanish'd, and the bright Sun of Glory shines, but 'tis Upon my Elder Brothers, and what's all this to me? Edward and Clarence, two goodly spreading Oaks, If both stand fair, I must expect no growth. This Letter, as from an unknown hand, lays all the Odium of his Imprisonment upon the King, and What will touch him nearer, his Mistress loss; Who by this time is married to Thyrrold, or worse, For he had unbounded license; the Contents of the Paper send him thither too; I am sure the Plot's Well laid, and must produce some mischief, which Ever way it makes for me: Here, trusty Friend, With your usual Caution, get this deliver'd to the Duke of Clarence. Serv. It shall, Sir? [Exit Serv. Glou. Were it alone to fight for Kingdoms, a well made thick Skull'd Hero might Excell me, but to keep the Engine of the mind At work by a deep thought, to do the Business, and turn the fools Swords upon each other, There I exceed the brawny Fellows and show my Master piece. [Exit. SCENE, the Castle. Enter Thyrrold, Isabella, and a Priest. Thyr. Nay, Madam, struggle not, what was before Perverseness, now will become a Sin, you know you Are my wedded Wife. Isa. Horrid prophaner of Heav'ns Laws, and ruiner Of me! did I not fly from thy detested hands; And call the Saints to witness, I wou'd never joyn Thee? speak, Holy Father, tho' ancle deep, thou art Not plunged all o'er in Sin, was that a Marriage, When my Screams rent the Sacred Chappel, and When my spirit quite exhausted, I lay in Dreadfull swounings, on the cold pavement. Pri. You will not hear me out: I say, 'twas by Compulsion, yet 'twas your stubbornness Occasion'd it, and since 'tis for the good of both, I pronounce it valid. Isa. Say not so; Holy Father, you shou'd Protect injur'd innocence; Oh, do not leave Me, stay, I conjure you stay? Pri. Madam, I cannot, pray loose your hold, business Of Importance calls me hence. Thyr. Slip thro' the Files, and hid 'em guard the Passage well. Look up my fair Bride. (Exit Priest. Be nice and coy no more, for spight of all your Coldness, ye now are mine. Isa. 'Tis false, if there be Guardian Angels, if the Just powers take note of holy vows, already Made, they will assist my helpless cries, and keep Me from the curse of being thine? yet hear me, Thyrrold, since Villany has born the mask of Love, Thus far I forgive thee, quit me now, and leave The reward of such a kindness to one who Owns a generous Soul. Thyr. Have my Rival thank me! is't not so? were your Beauty no greater than your Politicks, it had never Come to this. What, be a Traytor to that Queen, Who from my youth had foster'd me, draw the Noble Tudor's blood upon my head, and then give Back the price, for which I stak'd my Soul. Isa. Tudor dead? Oh I must prepare to suffer, My Queens curse hangs justly o'er me. Thyr. All you can imagine horrid, is past; but all To come, is pleasing? Pleasing, oh the poor expression! Transports and Extasies. Isa. Agonies beyond the bearing, and visited again On you: yes, Conscience will retort it back with Clamours never to be husht, and stings uncurable. Think on that, vile man? Thyr. Think and look on you, impossible! the kindled Fire mounts my veins, and I have already lost the use of Thought: Oh I will pour upon thee with desires, that Shall melt thy frozen heart, or cool at least my Burnings Isa. Where am I, in what dreadfull vision, transplanted To a barbarous clime. England ne'er brought forth Such a Monster, there must be help. My voice shall Wake some pitying Creature. Thyr. Again you judge me foolish; no my joys are well Secured, the generous Gloucester for my Treasons gave Me thee, since nothing else cou'd tempt me, and with A Guard Alcides, if such a one there were, cou'd Hardly pass; look that way and behold from this the Highest Lodgings of the Castle, the steps all lined With men arm'd and resolute, therefore consent, Comply, let me receive from kindness, what I Can from power. Give me thy Charms, or let me seize 'Em; one way or other, I must be blest. Isa. Hold, Sir, as ever you have heard of Vertue or Religion, for, sure you must have heard of both. Tho' you ne'er practis'd the beatick rules, remember There will come a time when these mad passions, That buoy your blood up to Rapes and Mischiefs, must Sink with fainting nature; when the bowl can Chear no more; then, Oh, reflect the horror to Look back on a lewd dessolute life, and forward on Eternity. Thyr. Fair preacher, I shall find out better use for Those soft lips, than Canting thus; let me close Their pretty railing and warm 'em to a smile. Isa. Stand off. By all my fears and woes, I feel a strength Celestial in my resolution, approach not, do not Move a hairs breadth, for if thou dost, I'll be reveng'd On those curst eyes, that lighted up thy Impious Love, with these hands tear out the hated balls, And dash 'em bleeding in thy face, when our bodies Yield our minds swerve first, but I can stop My breath and die, yes, Traytor, I both can and dare. Thyr. Oh, Isabella? where's now the Dove-like sweetness, Which first catch'd my Soul, I see by those furious Beams, those angry threatned threatning eyes dart On me, I can ne'er be blest, yet do not think; Your menaces cou'd stop me: for, know my power's So great, that I cou'd force upon you life and love, or the Effects of Love, but since I see that force wou'd Never be forgiven, that I shou'd never come to Those dear arms, a welcome guest perhaps, upon Some terms I may desist. Isa. Ha! what said ye, at such a goodness how soon Shou'd I forget my terrors, and turn all my Curses, into prayers and blessings. Thyr. Talk not of blessing, when I lose you, I lose all Hopes of happiness, here, or hereafter, therefore like The Foe of human kind, fain wou'd I sink My Rival down to my Perdition. Isa. What mean you? Thyr. Only this, that if I send you untouch'd and safely To the Queen, you never hold with Clarence Interviews, Discourse, or any sort of Correspondence more. Isa. Oh Heavens. Thyr. Start ye at this then, you shall straight be seiz'd, Drag'd to yon Apartment, and the curst happy youth, If you survive, as no doubt you will, Shall have but the leavings of my Fires? What! hoa! Isa. Stay a moment, what must I swear? Thyr. Wish that Contagion may seize this beauteous Body, and Furies haunt your Soul, when you consent to wed him. Isa. Alas! Thyr. Nay I allow no pause, resolve on one or other. Isa. Then be witness Heaven, which unassisting sees My sufferings here, I bid adieu to him and all mankind. Thyr. This is not enough, kneeling repeat the Imprecation, Diseases and Despair destract ye, when ever you Receive him, for your Lord swear to damnation. Swear? Isa. This is cruel usage, Thyrrold, to force upon my gentle Nature, dreadfull oaths which I have still abhorr'd. Thyr. Just now you cou'd rage at me, Your gentle nature quite forgot. Swear, or all my rage Returns with less Love and double Fury. Isa. Then as I hope for rest when this tormented soul Takes its flight, he never shall possess his Isabella? Thyr. Ha, ha, ha, now I find you are to be Conquer'd. In giving up your Love, you have given up that Resolution, Which shockt me, and since he never shall enjoy you, 'Tis but fit I shou'd supply his room; Come this way, no more preambles nor strugglings. Isa. Yes, whilst I have life? Oh that as I have in Fables read, I cou'd in very truth be turn'd into a stone, A tree, or any senseless Mass. Thyr. Your senses shall be Banquetted. If you strive More I must make use of ruder hands, I wou'd not willingly expose my Wife. Isa. Give me to Tygers to any thing but thee. Is no Compassion near? Help, help. Clashing of Swords. Clar. [Within.] Give way, give way: He dies, Whoever dares approach my fury. Thyr. Quitting Isa.] Ha betray'd! [drawing his sword. Isa. Oh, I will meet that voice thro' All the glittering dangers that my Eyes behold. Thyr. Stand back, you run on pointed Swords. Isa. No matter, I shall not now be forced. [As Clarence with his followers fights his way in, Isabella is stab'd. Isa. Ah me, it was unkind, but I shall soon find ease. [Falls: Thy. Oh rash adventurer, let 'em come, all the Prize is lost. [kneels to help her. Enter Clarence, Thyrrold's men fly. Clar. Thanks worthy men, who have ventured thus Your lives for my revenge. [Sees Thyr. and Isa. Ha! an Angel coupling with a Fiend! Rise Villain and meet my Sword. Or thus I'll send thee to thy native Hell. Thyr. I won't fight, you are the Brother of my King If you kill me you know your Pardon's sure, Shou'd I but draw the blood of you I stand Condemn'd. Clar. Poor and Precarious will ye not fight for Isabellassa? Thyr. She is not worth it now, your honour will not Let you strike a naked Bosom, and I'll make no defence. Clar. Oh most detested baseness, live, drag on That shamefull life, but fly lest I am tempted With thy loathed sight to an unmanly deed. Thyr. Yes, I will live to act more mischiefs, if I Judge my Master right, that set me on to this: It may fall on thee. Torturing Love shall fill my Breast no more, But rage and enmity possess my mind, To vex and ruin the race of human kind. (Exit Thyr. Clar. Oh guilty, guilty Isabella? Well may'st thou fall on Earth, and hide thy eyes, Which dare not sure look up to Heaven, after all These Perjuries, yet rise, follow with haste the choice, Which thou prefer'st to doting Clarence, and let me No more behold thy fatal Beauties: 'tis true, I did come mad with a resolve to kill thy Husband, His Cowardice has prevented me? Oh ye cruel powers, Cou'd he find no other bosom to blush away His shame in, but my Isabella's, mine adored, Thou dost not stir nor answer me, and oh, I dare not raise thee, but to touch thy hand, Wou'd fire my soul, and set me into wild distraction, And therefore away, yet wilt thou not move, And oh, I feel a Mothers earning on me Towards an erring Child: I must gaze upon thee, tho' it gives me death: Ha! death indeed? Who has done this, my love is pale and bleeding. 1. Foll. Alas, how came she wounded? Clar. And I curst Villain, worse than Thyrrold, Instead of help have wasted time in my reproaches, Assist, Oh! softly, softly, touch my dying Love. (rasing her. Isa. reviving.) Where am I; I'll none of Thyrrold: Let me go, let me go? Clar. What means all this, O look and speak to thy Clarence, What wicked practices have been acted here: How came this streaming Wound; fly for some help. Isa. 'Tis he, 'tis he! Oh I will throw my Virgin arms about thy neck, Unus'd to such embraces, But I've been frighted, Clarence, and here I will Recover Peace. Clar. Oh my Souls Comfort, my hearts Joy, Whom I'll suspect no more, this ardor does Convince me of thy truth, but Oh Almighty love! Now cannot save us, Whilst thus you bless me with your kindness, Your Life, your precious Life expires. Isa. No matter, let it go, alas I am weary on't: Stand back, I had forgot, I have sworn never To see thee more, but that's no matter neither; I am going where there is no oppression, No injustice, there I shall be forgiven, This last pleasure dying in my Clarence arms. Clar. To all my Countries happiness I must for ever bid adieu, it has No longer date than this poor breath of thine, Which pants and heaves thy labouring Breast, And grows each moment shorter: Oh Isabella, Must we part for ever, wretch that I am Bankrupt in Love, can I speak that and live? Isa. Still so kind; then prithee tell me, Whilst I have sense to ask it, why when half dead With fears, I to Malavill deliver'd up the Key, You sent your cruel Brothers, to the ruin of The Queen and me. Clar. Didst thou then see Malavill? Isa. I did. Clar. Curst be his memory; it is enough to Say that we both have been betray'd, Which, when I forgive ye Brothers, Dogs gnaw the flesh of Clarence, Some death horrid and unusual seize meâ And send me quick into Perdition. Isa. Oh my Plantagenet, oh my lovely dear? Whose form my dying eyes pursue, tho now They dance in mists give me not greater pangs, Than what death brings, when I am dead, as soon I shall be, for I feel the cold Tyrant creep O'er all my limbs, my heart holds out A little longer to charge thee not to Quarrel With the King for me; I cannot die in Peace to leave my love in danger. Clar. Excellent goodness, unexampled patience, Oh thou art going and I behold it. Isa. I am indeed, yet I have one thing more to ask, Let me be born to the Queen, I've wronged And lay my dead body at her feet, Too poor the expiation of her sorrows, the fatal Ruines which my head-long passion caus'd. Clar. And I, curst I, the black occasion. Isa. Oh no, thou ever wert my hearts desire, And may'st thou still remain blest as thou hast been, By me beloved, have mercy Heaven on my Youth, Forgive my errors and receive me. (Dies. Clar. My Isabella, my Love, still there is life, Her lips have still a lively warmth, I'll have her body Thus Embalm'd, and kneel for ever by her side; Where is thy rosie breath retir'd, thou morning Sweetness, thus early snatcht long before thou hadst Reach'd the noon of life, but hold, I had forgot my Friends: I pray retire I have some unmanly mournings Which the gust of grief for this fair Saint requires, That will admit of no Spectators, wait without: Anon I'll call ye? Foll. I fear, what he intends yet dare not Contradict him, but will send one That has more power. Clar. Oh my Isabella! we will part no more, Let the Bugbear death, fright guilty men, Fright those wretches, that brought thy Beauties To this untimely paleness. One kiss, cold as Winters Frost On the first peeping Flowers, Thou perfect sweetness hover a little, or if thou hast arriv'd The blissfull seats, make intercession there for me, And for this death which violent passion Plunges me upon. (Goes to fall upon his Sword. Warwick enters, and strikes it away. Warw. Are you a man? Clar. A man, my Lord; yes, that's my Curse! that's My Misfortune: but were I a nobler being, At such a loss, at such a sight, 'Twou'd break the temper of an Angelick frame, And set the Immortal on eternal ravings. Warw. Leave your Romantick Style, and desperate Thoughts, I find there was foul play; had you trusted Me, it might have been prevented; but since 'tis past, Be calm: I wou'd not have the world say, I chose to my Friend a Lunatick, and that's the Kindest name we give self-murderers. Clar. I am so, and surely the soonest mad men Are destroy'd, 'tis best: nay, shou'd you perswade me To be reconciled to life, you'd but preserve it for The Hangmans hands; if I live the King's not safe: Treason and Parricide will be my practice. That dead lovely Image will dwell upon my memory, And still excite me to revenge; no, she can Never be forgot, unless I plunge my self in Riots; Renounce my reason and remembrance, And leave to Fame a blotted story. War. Is all your Mothers piety and carefull Lessons Quite forgot? Oh Clarence, it wou'd prove a dreadfull Case, to play the Hero here, and find the Christians Punishment beneath. Clar. 'Tis worse to live on in black despair, and sin Beyond forgiveness: Return my Sword, for I Will hear no more. Warw. Do not provoke me to expose your Follies: Your extravagancy is yet unknown, Think of revenge, live to accomplish that, In that I will assist ye, rather than See you fall. Clar. Ay now thou speakest indeed, and charmest me Into life; won't thou help me in the Just work; Pull the aspirers down, who, without cause, Plotted the destruction of me and all my Joys? War. Carry this fair Maid to the Queens apartment And of her death give there a just account. Clar. Must she then go? Is that necessary To our contract of revenge? War. Draw off your Friends, and to my Castle Bend your way: into this business strict enquiry Shall be made; yes, you shall have Justice! Clar. Nay, by Heaven I will, by Warwick (another Oath) I will; but can Astrea, can Justice restore Her back again? No, 'tis impossible: Therefore to Wilds and Seas I will remove, And taste no comfort since I've lost my love. [Ex. The Curtain falls: Enter Lord Dacres and Esperanza. Esp. My Lord, you're come to meet news as sad As what you bring; to see a wretched Court, The very Epitome of sorrow, and the lovely Queen, Chief Mourner? who for her Tudor slain, In destraction raves away the hours she hates, And from her kneeling Servants refuses either Counsel or Support, the fair Isabella too, Is forc'd we know not where or to what Fate. Dac. 'Tis from examples like to these, we ought To learn there's no stability below, For if these who did command vast Empires, Whose eyes cou'd see no limits to their Extended sway, yet when the mouldring earth Was theirs, cou'd not secure a lasting happiness; What Emet, what Mole, but Man, wou'd heave, And work on in darkness, still living on fates decoy, Deluding hope; yet never reach the expected day, That brings us Joy Sincere; Show me this Royal sadness, The torrent of whose griefs I'll strive to calm, Tho' 'tis impossible to dry the source. Curtain rising, discovers Queen Catharine sitting on a Couch, with Herbs and Flowers by her, attended. Cat. Here, give me more, more of the Cypress, and That grave shading yew, let the Carnutions lose their colour, And display the blooming Rose in some black die, Till I've made my Garland Dark as my Woes, and Dismal as my Despair? Dac. Ha! 'is worse than I expected, Oh Henry! it Is not given sure for those above to view their Friends beneath, if 'twere this sight wou'd interrupt Thy Peace, and turn shee a Sympathizing mourner 'Midst the blest. Cat. Who's there, my Lord Dacres? Dac. Your ready Servant, who weeps to see the Majesty of France and England thus employ'd? Cat. You think me mad! alas, Sir, I am not so happy: Indeed I'm trying, 'fast as e'er I can to obtain The blessing; but yet, I remember that Tudor Was, that he was, faithfull, lovely, good, and Murder'd for all that, yes, at my feet he fellâ Come all ye Bedlam wretches, shake your horrid Chains, grin and scream around me, 'till my Brains are quite o'erturn'd; let me feel all your Stripes, and wants, and straw, so I am rid of the Racks my mind indures: the Trumpets when They sounded Edward's Victorious entrance, here Were such Musickâyet that will not do! Dac. What shall I say, words but augment the wounds, They cannot cure; to tell this Royal fair, that She once had temper, that she bore my great Masters loss with Saint-like patience, to urge That now, alass, is vain! Cat. True, Dacres; for that was the work of Heaven, And Heaven gave me patience: but this is Hell; All Hell, and 'tis from thence I rave. Dac. Fain I wou'd injoyn you hear me, I dare not Give my self so bold a name as Friend. Cat. Friends, I've none, if thou pretend'st to ought, Be gone, and leave me: Leave me to earth and Deep despair; death and destruction are the Only Friends I chuse. Here will I fall; strow me With herbs and flowers, then weep About me as if I were dead: perhaps I may Grow senseless. Dac. Oh deep excess of mourning: to which I have But one Argument in answer: come forth ye Charming little ones, and raise your drooping Mother. [He leads in the Queens Children in Mourning. Cat. rising.] Ha! Dac. Kneel, sweet Images of lovely Catharine! kneel! Speak not, but heave your little hands for Mercy, 'tis the Queen alone can save you; whilst She lives France is potent, and must be fear'd If violence is offer'd; but your Protectress gone You may be swallowed in the Whirpool of Ambition, and the crime forgot: See how their Infant eyes are wet with tears, they are frighted, Tho' they do not know for what. Cat. Oh, Dacres! Dacres! why hast thou done this? Now I do remember, Tudor's words, his last Desire, that I shou'd live for them, raise 'em From Earth, their tender knees will ake; no, Let 'em kneel on, they are born slaves, and Must, perhaps, be much longer compell'd to Do their duty. Dac. Now by the Soul of my great master, by Royal Henry, I read in these small lines Majestick glory! Methinks I am inspir'd to say, from these branches, Shall come a noble stock of Princes, which must Bless, And Wed, and intermixing, heal the distracted Land, Behold the Queen and Tudor's blooming grace, Nature her self can scarce make such another face. Cat. Oh bring 'em near me, thou Oracle, thou soul Of goodness, do what thou won't with me and them. Dac. Upon the banks of Silver Thames, there is a Monastery which seems as built for retiring Princes, so Quiet, and so neatly form'd, near the Metropolis it Stands, there you may live in peace, my self will quit All further thoughts of Business, or of State, and if I Once inquire into the World, it shall be only for Your safety, and the good of these! Cat. I thank thee, Dacres, and, I thank Heaven I am Compos'd. Enter Esperanza. Esp. Oh horror! accumulated sorrows, like rowling Billows, heap upon us still. Dac. Peace, the Queen but now is calm, disturb her With no new affliction? Cat. I stand prepar'd, there's nothing now can shock Me; Speak! Esp. The lovely Isabella is brought dead, the bearers Say, her last request was your Forgiveness, that She might be laid at your Royal feet, and your Majesty wou'd pardon her unwilling fault. Cat. Oh Esperanza! too late you told me of her Intended flight, Love was her only crime, yet she proved Fates cruel Instrument of my undoing, why This was, why so ordained is beyond mortal inquiry, And I shou'd submit. Where is the poor unhappy Maid? alas! But she is past it all, and Now finds rest; for if soft Innocence can reach The bright Ãthereal seats; she's surely there Give order for our instant March; let her Corps Precede the dismal journey, and let us follow as Those sad Friends their best beloved to the last Stage, the Grave. My Dacres, that's the sure reception of us all, But they sleep best who do with honour fall. [Exeunt Omnes. Enter Edward, Duke of Gloucester, and Officers. Edw. She's gone, and with her go all that ever Discompos'd my Soul, now to Glory and his Country's Good, Edward wholly will devote himself: let us towards London take our triumphant way; That City in whose favour we are blest. Glou. You, I suppose, have heard that Clarence Proclaims his wrongs a loud, that Warwick owns his Cause, and with a Guard has sent him to his Castle. Edw. Towards that rash Prince, my Lords, we doubt Not to approve our self a Friend and Brother; if Warwick sides with him, tho' he stands high In our esteem, yet we wo'n't fear the Warrior, Nor call the work of Heaven his alone. Kingdoms are given by the powers above, And the chief blessing is our peoples love: Whilst we are just, they ought and must be kind, No Cement does so fast as Justice bind. FINIS.</field>
