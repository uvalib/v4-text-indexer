      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Right Honourable Charles Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesties Houshold, and one of His Majesties most Honourable Privy-Council, &amp;c. May it please your Lordship, This Play, when it was Acted, in the Character of the Princess of Jainville, had a resemblance of Marguerite in the Massacre of Paris, Sister to Charles the Ninth, and Wife to Henry the Fourth King of Navar: That fatal Marriage which cost the Blood of so many Thousand Men, and the Lives of the best Commanders. What was borrowed in the Action is left out in the Print, and quite obliterated in the minds of Men. But the Duke of Guise, who was Notorious for a bolder Fault, has wrested two whole Scenes from the Original, which after the Vacation he will be forc'd to pay. I was, I confess, through Indignation, forc'd to limb my own Child, which Time, the true Cure for all Maladies, and Injustice has set together again. The Play cost me much pains, the Story is true, and I hope the Object will display Treachery in its own Colours. But this Farce, Comedy, Tragedy or meer Play, was a Revenge for the Refusal of the other; for when they expected the most polish'd Hero in Nemours, I gave 'em a Ruffian reeking from Whetstone's-Park. The fourth and fifth Acts of the Chances, where Don John is pulling down; Marriage Alamode, where they are bare to the Waste; the Libertine, and Epsom-Wells, are but Copies of his Villainy. He lays about him like the Gladiateor in the Park; they may walk by, and take no notice. I beg your Lordship to excuse this account, for indeed 'tis all to introduce the Massacre of Paris to your Favour, and approve it to be play'd in its first Figure. Your Lordships Humble and Obedient Servant, NAT. LEE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. Trust was the Glory of the foremost Age, When Truth and Love with Friendship did engage; When Man to Man cou'd walk with Arms entwin'd, And vent their Griefs in spaces of the Wind; Express their minds, and speak their thoughts as clear, As Eastern Mornings op'ning to the year. But since that Law and Treachery came in, And open Honesty was made a Sin, Men wait for Men as Dogs for Foxes prey, And Women wait the closing of the day. There's scarce a man that ventures to be good, For Truth by Knaves was never understood; For there's the Curse, when Vice o'er Vertue rules, That all the World are Knaves or downright Fools. So they may make advantage of th'Allay, They'll take the Dross and through the Gold away. Women turn Usurers with their own affright, And Want's the Hag that rides 'em all the night. The little Mob, the City Wastcoateer, Will pinch the Back to make the Buttock bare, And drain the last poor Guinea from her Dear. Thus Times are turn'd upon a private end, There's scarce a Man that's generous to his Friend. But there's a Monarch on a Throne sublime, That makes Truth Law, and gives the Poets Rhime; Be his the bus'ness of our little Fates, Our mean Contentions, and their high Debates. By Sea and Land our most Imperial Lord, With all the Praises Blest that Hearts afford, With Lawrels Crown'd, unconquer'd by the Sword: William the Sovereign of our whole Affairs, Our Guide in Peace, and Council in the Wars.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Nemours, Bellamore. Fiddles Playing. Nem. Hold there you Monsieur Devol; prithe leave off playing fine in Consort, and stick to Time and TuneâSo now the Song, call in the Eunuch; come my pretty Stallion, Hem and begin. SONG. [I.] All other Blessings are but Toyes To his that in his sleep enjoyes, Who in his Fancy can possess The object of his Happiness; The Pleasure's purer for he spares The Pains, Expenses, and the Cares. II. Thus when Adonis got the stone, To Love the Boy still made his moan; Venus the Queen of Fancy came, And as he slept she cool'd his flame; The Fancy charm'd him as he lay, And Fancy brought the Stone away. Nem. Sirrah, stick to clean Pleasures, deep Sleep, moderate Wine, sincere Whores, and thou art happy; Now by this damask Cheek I love thee; keep but this gracious Form of thine in health, and I'll put thee in the way of living like a manâWhat I have trusted thee withâMy Love to the Princess of Cleve, Treasure it as thy Life, nor let the Vidam of Chartres know it; for however I seem to cherish him, because he has the knack of telling a Story maliciously, and is a great pretender to Nature, I cast him off hereâ'Tis too much for him: Besides he is her Uncle, and has a sort of affected Honour, that wou'd make him grin to see me leap herâHey JaquesâWhen Madam Tournon comes, bring her in; and heark you Sir, whoever comes to speak with me, while she is with meâ Jaq. What if the Dauphin comes? Nem. What if his Father comes, DogâSlaveâFool! What if Paris were a fire, the President and Council of sixteen at the door! I'm sick, I'm not withinâI'm a hundred mile offâMy bosom DearâSo young, and yet I trust thee tooâBut away, to the Princess of Cleve, thou art acquainted with her Women, watch her Motions, my sweet-fac'd Pimp, and bring me word of her rising. Bell. She is a prize, my Lord, and oh what a night of pleasure has Cleve had with herâthe first too! Nem. Any thing but what makes such a pleasure, wou'd I give for such anotherâBut be gone, and no more of this provoking discourse, lest Ravishing shou'd follow thee at the heels, and spoil my sober design. Exeunt severally. Enter Tournon, La March. Jaq. Madam, my Lord was just now asking for you. Tour. Go tell him I'm comingâIs he dress'd? Jaq. YesâBut your Ladiship knows that's all one to himâ Tour. Honest Jaques, 'tis pity such. Honesty should not be encourag'dâ Jaq. This comes of Pimping, which she calls Honesty. Exit. Jaq. Tour. Thus thou mayst see the method of the QueenâWe are the lucky Sieves, where fond men trust their Hearts, and so she sists 'em through usâ La M. What of Nemours, whom you thus early visit? Tour. The Queen designs to rob him of a Mistress, Marguerite the Princess of Janvill, whom he keeps from the knowledge of the Court; and if the Queen be a Judge, is contracted to herâ The Dauphin loves her too, whereon the Queen, Who works the Court quite round by Womankind, And thinks this way to mould his supple Soul, Resolves, if possible, to gain her for him. La M. But how is't possible to work the Princess from the Duke Nemours, who loves him as the Queen affects Ambition. Tour. Why thus she knows Nemours his Soul is bent Upon variety, therefore to gain her ends She has made me Sacrifice my Honour, nay I'm become his Bawd, and ply him ev'ry day With some new face, to wean his heart From Marguerite's Form, nor must you longer be Without your part. La M. Employ me, for you know the Queen commands me. Tour. There was a Letter dropt in the Tennis-Court Out of Nemours his Pocket, as I'm told, And read last night in the presenceâ'Tis your Task Slily to insinuate with Marguerite. This Note which came from some abandon'd Mistress, Is certainly the Dukesâ La M. Then Jealousie's the ground on which you build. Tour. Right, we must make 'em jealous of each other; Jealousie breeds disdain in haughty minds, and so from the extreams of violent Love, proceeds to fiercest hate. But see the gay, the brisk, the topping Gallant St. Andre [Enter St. A. here, Couzen to Poltrot, who arrived from England with a pretty Wife last week, and Lodges in the Palace of this his related FoolâSt. Andre has a Wife too of my acquaintanceâ Both for the Duke my Dear; but haste I'm call'dâ [Exit La March. Jaq. Madamâ Tour. I go. [Exit Tournon. St. A. Monsieur Jaques, your most obliged faithful humble Servant. What, his Grace continues the old Trade I see, by the Flux of Bawds and Whores that choak up his Avenues, and I must confess, excepting my self, there's no man so built for Whoring as his Grace, black sanguine Brawnyâa Roman Noseâlong Foot and a stiffâcalf of a Leg. Jaq. Your Lordship has all these in Perfection. St. A. Sir your most faithful obliged humble Servant. Boyâ B. My Lordâ St. A. How many Bottles last night? B. Five my Lord. St. A. Boy. B. My Lord. St. A. How many Whores? B. Six my Lord. St. A. Boyâ B. My Lord. St. A. What Quarrels, how many did I kill? B. Not one my LordâBut the night before you Hamstrung a Beadle, and run a Link-man in the Backâ St. A. What, and no Blood nor Blows last night? B. O yes my Lord, now I remember me, you drew upon a Gentleman that knock'd you down with a Bottle. St. A. Not so loud you Urchin, lest I twist your neck roundâ Monsieur Jaques is his Grace stirring? Jaq. My Lord, he's at Councilâ St. A. Od I beg his Pardon, pray give my duty to him, and tell him, if he pleased to hear a languishing Air or two, I am at the Princess of Cleve's with a SerenadeâGo Raskal, go to Monsieur Poltrotâtell him he'll be too lateâBlack airy shapeâbut then Madam Cleve is Vertuous, Chast, ColdâGad I'll write to her, and then she's mine directly, for 'tis but reason of course, that he that has been Yoak'd to so many Dutchesses, should at last back a Princess: Sir, your most obliged faithful and very humble Servant Sir. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Nemours, Tournon. Tour. Undone, undone! will your sinful Grace never give over, will you never leave Ruining of Bodies and Damning of Soulsâcou'd you imagine that I came for this? What have you done? Nem. No harm, pretty Rogue, no harm, nay, prithee leave blubbering. Tour. 'Tis blubbering now, plain blubbering, but before you had your will 'twas another tone; why Madam do you wast those precious Tears, each falling drop shines like an Orient Pearl, and sets a Gaity on a Face of Sorrow. Nem. Thou art certainly the pleasantest of Womankind, and I the happiest of Men; dear delightful Rogue, let's have another Main like a winning Gamester, I long to make it t'other hundred Pound. Tour. Inconsiderate horrid Peer, will you Damn your Soul deeper and deeper, can you be thus insensible of your Crime? Nem. Why there's it, I was as a man may be, very dry, and thou kind Soul, gav'st me a good draught of Drink; now 'tis strange to me, if a man must be Damn'd for quenching his thirst. Tour. Ha, HaâWell, I'll swear you are such another manâ who wou'd have thought you cou'd delude a Woman thus, and a Woman of Honour too, that resolv'd so much against it; Ah my Lord! your Grace has a cunning Tongue. Nem. No cunning Tournon, my way is downright, leaving Body, State and Spirit, all for a pretty Woman, and when gray Hairs, Gout and Impotence come, no more but this, drink away pain, and be gathered to my Fathers. Tour. Oh thou dissembler, give me your hand, this soft, this faithless violating hand, Heaven knows what this hand has to answer for. Nem. And for this hand, with these long, white, round, pretty Bobbins, t'has the kindest gripe, and I so love it, now Gad's Blessing on't, that's all I sayâBut come tell me, what no new Game, for thou knowest I dye directly without variety. Tour. Certainly never Woman lov'd like me, who am not satisfied with sacrificing my own Honour, unless I rob my delights by undoing othersâ Nem. Come, come, out with it, I see thou art big with some new Intrigue, and it labours for a vent. Tour. What think you of St. Andre's Lady? Nem. That I'm in Bed with her, because thou darst befriend me. Tour. Nay, there's moreâMonsieur Poltrot lodges in his House, with a young English Wife of the true breed, and the prettier of the two. Nem. Excellent Creature, but command me something extravagant, as thy kindness, State, Life and Honour. Tour. Yet all this will be lost when you are married to Marguerite. Nem. Never, by Heaven I'm thine, with all the heat and vigorous Inspiration of an unflesh'd Loverâand so will be while young Limbs and Lechery hold together, and that's a Bond methinks shou'd last till Doomsday. Tour. But do you believe if Marguerite shou'd knowâ Nem. The question's too graveâwhen and where shall I see the Gems thou hast in store? Tour. By Noon or thereabouts; take a turn in Lunemburg Garden, and one, if not both, shall meet you. Nem. And thou'lt appear in Person? Tour. With Colours flying, a Handkerchief held out; and yet methinks it goes against my Conscience. Nem. Away, that serious look has made thee old: Conscience and Consideration in a young Woman too? It makes a Bawd of thee before thy time. Nay, now thou put'st me in Poetick Rapture, And I must quote Ronsard to punish thee: Call all your Wives to Council, and prepare To Tempt, Dissemble, Flatter, Lye and Swear; To make her mine, use all your utmost skill, Vertue! An ill-bred crosness in the will; Honour a Notion, Piety a Cheat, Prove but successful Bawds and you are great. Come, thou wilt meet me. Tour. 'Tis resolv'd I will, till which time, thou dear Manâ Nem. Thou pretty Woman. Tour. Thou very dear Man. Nem. Thou very pretty Woman one Kiss. Tour. Hey Hoâ Nem. Now all the Gods go with theeâ Tour. A word my Lord, you are acquainted with these Fops; set 'em in the modish way of abusing their Wives, they are turning already, and that will certainly bring 'em about. Nem. Bellamore shall do't with less suspicion: farewellâ [Exit Tour. Hey Jaquesâ Enter Jaques with the Vidam. Jaq. Ha! my grave Lord of Chartres, welcome as Health, as Wine, and taking Whoresâand tell me now the bus'ness of the Court. Vid. Hold it Nemours for ever at defiance, Fogs of ill humour, damps of Melancholy, Old Maids of fifty choak'd with eternal Vapours, Stuff it with fulsome Honourâdozing Vertue, And everlasting dullness husk it round, Since he that was the Life, the Soul of Pleasure, Count Rosidore, is dead. Nem. Then we may say Wit was and Satyr is a Carcass now. I thought his last Debauch wou'd be his Deathâ But is it certain? Vid. Yes I saw him dust. I saw the mighty thing a nothing made, Huddled with Worms, and swept to that cold Den, Where Kings lye crumbled just like other Men. Nem. Nay then let's Rave and Elegize together, Where Rosidore is now but common clay, Whom every wiser Emmet bears away, And lays him up against a Winters day. He was the Spirit of Witâand had such an art in guilding his Failures, that it was hard not to love his Faults: He never spoke a Witty thing twice, tho to different Persons; his Imperfections were catching, and his Genius was so Luxuriant, that he was forc'd to tame it with a Hesitation in his Speech to keep it in viewâBut oh how awkard, how insipid, how poor and wretchedly dull is the imitation of those that have all the affectation of his Verse and none of his Wit. Enter Jaques. Jaq. My Lord, Monsieur Poltrot desires to kiss your Grace's hand. Nem. Let's have him to drive away our Melancholyâ Vid. I wonder what pleasure you can take in such dull Dogs, Asses, Fools. Nem. But this is a particular Fool Man, Fate's own Fool, and perhaps it will never hit the like again, he's ever the same thing, yet always pleasing,; in short, he's a finish'd Fool, and has a fine Wife; add to this his late leaving the Court of France, and going to England to learn breeding. Enter Poltrot. Pol. My Lord Duke, your Grace's most obedient humble Servant, My Lord of Chartres and Monsieur Jaques, yours Monsieur; St. Andre desires your Grace's presence at a Serenade of mine and his togetherâAnd I must tell your Grace by the way, he is a great Master, and the fondest thing of my Laboursâ Nem. And the greatest Oaf in the World. Pol. How my Lordâ Vid. The whole Court wonders you will keep him company. Nem. Such a passive Raskal, he had his Shins broke last night in the Presence, and were it not fear'd you wou'd second him, he wou'd be kick'd out of all Society. Pol. I Second him my Lord, I'll see him Damn'd e'er I'll be Second to any Fool in ChristendomâFor to tell your Grace the truth, I keep him company and lye at his House, because I intend to lye with his Wife; a trick I learnt since I went into England, where o'my Conscience Cuckoldom is the Destiny of above half the Nation. Nem. Indeed! Pol. O there's not such another Drinking, Scowring, Roaring, Whoreing Nation in the WorldâAnd for little London, to my knowledge, if a Bill were taken of the weekly Cuckolds, it wou'd amount to more than the Number of Christnings and Burials put together. Vid. What, and were you acquainted with the Wits? Pol. O Lord Sir, I liv'd in the City a whole year together, my Lord Mayor and I, and the Common-Council were sworn BrothersâI cou'd sing you twenty Catches and Drolls that I made for their Feast-days, but at present I'll only hint you one or twoâ Nem. Pray do us the Favour Sir. Pol. Why look you Sir, this is one of my chief ones, and I'll assure your Grace, 'twas much Sung at Court too. O to Bed to meâto Bed to meâ&amp;c. Nem. Excellent, incomparable. Pol. Why is it not my Lord? This is no Kickshaw, there's substance in the Air, and weight in the words; nay, I'll give your Grace a taste of another, the Tune is, let me seeâAy, Ayâ Give me the Lass that is true Country bredâ But I'll present your Grace with some words of my own, that I made on my Wife before I married her, as she sate singing one day in a low Parlour and playing on the Virginals. Nem. For Heavens sake oblige us dear pleasant Creatureâ Pol. I'll swear I'm so ticklish you'll put me out my Lord, for I am as wanton as any little Bartholomew Bore-Pigâ Vid. Dear soft delicate Rogue sing. Pol. Nay, I protest my Lord, I vow and swear, but you'll make me run to a WhoreâLord Sir, what do you mean? Nem. Come then beginâ Poltrot. Sings. [I] Phillis is soft, Phillis is plump, And Beauty made up this delicate lump: Like a Rose bud she looks, like a Lilly she smells, And her Voice is a Note above sweet Philomel's. Now a little Smutty my Lord is the fashionâ II. Her Breasts are two Hillocks where Hearts lye and pant, In the Herbage so soft, for a thing that they want; But Mum Sir for that, tho a notable Jest, For if I shou'd name it you'd call me a Beast. Enter St. Andre without his Hat and Wig. St. A. My Lord, the Serenade is just begun, and if you don't come just in the nickâI beg your Grace's Pardon for interrupting youâBut if you have a mind to hear the sweetest Airs in the Worldâ Nem. With all my heart Sirâ Pol. Nay, since your Grace has put my hand in, I'll sing you my Lord, before you go, the softest thingâcompos'd in the Nonage of my Muse; yet such a one as our best Authors borrow from. Nay, I'll be judg'd by your Grace, if they do not steal their Dying from my Killingâ St. A. Nay prithee Poltrot thou art so impertinent. Pol. No more impertinent than your self Sir, nor do I doubt Sir, but my Character shall be drawn by the Poets for a Man of Wit and Sense Sir, as well as your self Sirâ Vid. Ay I'll be sworn shall itâ Pol. For I know how to Repartee with the best, to Rally my Wife, to kick her too if I please Sir, to make Similes as fast as Hops Sir, tho I lay a dying slap dash Sir, quickly off and quickly on Sir, and as round as a Hoop Sirâ St. A. I grant you Dear Bully all this, but let's have your Song another time, because mine are begun. Pol. Nay, look you Dear Rogue, mine is but a Prologue to your Play, and by your leave his Grace has a mind to hear it, and he shall hear it Sirâ Nem. Ay and will hear it Sir, tho the Great Turk were at St. Dennis's Gate; come along my Orpheus, and then Sir we'll follow you to the Prince of Cleve'sâ BalladâWhen PhÅbus had fetch'd, &amp;c. [Exeunt Singing. SCENE III. The Prince of Cleve's Palace. Musick. SONG. [I.] In a Room for Delight, the Landskip of Love, Like a shady old Lawn With the Curtains half drawn, My Love and I lay, in the cool of the day, Till our Joyes did remove. II. So fierce was our Fight, and so smart e'ry stroak, That Love the little Scout Was put to the Rout; His Bow was unbent, e'ry Arrow was spent, And his Quiver all broke. Enter Vidam, Nemours. Nem. I have lost my Letter, and by your Description It must be that which the Queen read at Court. But are you sure the Princess of Cleve has seen it? Vid. Why are you so concern'd, does your wild Love Turn that way tooâShe is too Grave. Nem. Too Grave, as if I cou'd not laugh with this, and try with that, and veer with every gust of PassionâBut has she seen it? Vid. She has the Letter, the Queen Dauphin sent it her. Nem. Then you must own it on occasion, and whatever else I shall put upon your Personâ Vid. Why? Nem. Lest it shou'd reach the Ears of Marguerite, For, Oh my Vidam! 'tis such a ranting Devil, If she believes this Letter mine, when next We meet, beware my Locks and EyesâNo more, But this remember that, you own it. [Exit. Enter St. Andre and Poltrot. St. A. His Bow was unbent, &amp;c. [Singing with Poltrot. Come, my Lord, we'll have all over agen. Enter the Prince of Cleve. Vid. See, we have rais'd the Prince of Cleve: My Lord, good Morrowâ P. C. Good morrow my good LordâSave you my dear Nemours! Pol. Give you Joy my Lord: What a little blew under the Eyes, Ha, Haâ St. A. Give you Joy my Lord: Ha, my Lord, Ha. [Holds up 3 Fing. Pol. Ha, my Lord, Haâ [Holding up five Fingers. P. C. You are merry GentlemenâI am not in the vein, Therefore, Dear Chartres, take these Fingers hence. St. A. My Lord, you look a little heavy, shall we Dance, Sing, Fence, take the Air, Rideâ Vid. Come away Sir, the Prince is indispos'd. St. A. Gad I remember now I talk of riding, at the Tournament of Mete, as I was riding the great Horseâ Vid. Leave off your Lying, and come along. St. A. With three pushes of Pike, and six hits of Sword, I wounded the Duke of Ferrara, Duke of Millain, Duke of Parma, Prince of Cleveâ P. C. My Lord, I was not thereâ St. A. My LordâI beg your Lordships pardon, I meant the Vidam of Chartres. Vid. You Lye, I was then at Rome. St. A. My Lordâ Pol. Ha, HaâLord, Lord, how this World is given to Lying! HaâCome, come, you're damnably out, come away. St. A. My Lord, I beg your pardon, I see you are indispos'd, besides the Queen oblig'd me this Morning to let 'em choose Colours for my Complexionâ Vid. Heark you, will you go or shall Iâ [Pulling him off by the Nose. St. A. My Friend, my Lord you see, is a little Familiar, but I am ever your Highness's most humble faithful obedient Servant. [Exeunt. Manet P. Cleve. Full of himself, the happy Man is gone; Why was not I too cast in such a Mould? To think like him, or not to think at all. Enter the Princess of Cleve. Had he a Bride like me, Earth wou'd not bear him: But Oh I wish that it might cover me! Since Chartres cannot love me: Oh I found it! Last night I found it in her cold Embraces; Her Lips too coldâCold as the Dew of Death: And still whene'er I prest her in my arms, I found my Bosom all afloat with Tears. Princess C. He weeps, O Heaven! my Lordâthe Prince of Cleve. P. C. My Life, my Dearest part! Princess C. Why Sighs my Lord? What have I done Sir, thus to discompose you? P. C. Nothing. Princess C. Ah Sir, there is a Grief within, And you wou'd hide it from me. P. C. Nothing my Chartres, nothing here but Love. Princess C. Alas, my Lord, you hide that Secret from me, Which I must know or think you never lov'd me. P. C. Ah Princess! that you lov'd but half so well! Princess C. I have it then, you think me Criminal, And tax my Honourâ P. C. Oh forbid it Heavenâ But since you press me Madam, let me ask you, Why when the Princess led you to the Altar, Why cak'd the Tears upon your Bloodless Face? Why sigh'd you when your hand was clasp'd with mine? As if your Heart, your Heart refus'd to joyn. Princess C. Ah Sirâ P. C. Behold, you're dash'd with the remembrance; Why when my Hopes were fierce, and Joys grew strong, Why were you carri'd like a Coarse along? When like a Victim by my side you lay, Why did you Gasp, why did you Swoon away? O speakâ You have a Soul so open and so clear, That if there be a Fault it must appear. Princess C. Alas you are not skill'd in Beauties cares, For Oh! when once the god his Wrath declares; And Stygian Oaths have wing'd the bloody Dart, To make its passage thro the Virgins Heart: She hides her Wound, and hasting to the Grove, Scarce whisp'ring to the Winds her conscious Love. The touch of him she loves she'll not endure, But Weeps and Bleeds, and strives against the Cure: So judge of me when any Grief appears, Believe my Sighs are kind, and trust my Tears. P. C. Vanish my Doubts, and Jealousies be gonâ On thy lov'd Bosom let me break my Joy, O only Sweets that Fill, but never Cloy: And was it, was it only Virgins fear? But speak for ever and I'll ever hear. Repeat, and let the Ecchoes deal it round, While list'ning Angels bend to catch the Sound; Nay, Sigh and Weep, drain all thy precious Store, Be kind, as now, and I'll complain no more. [Exit. Princess C. Was ever Man so worthy to be lov'd, So good, so gentle, soft a Disposition, As if no Gaul had mixt with his Creation: So tender and so fearful to displease, No barbarous Heart but thine wou'd stop his entrance; But thou Inhumane banisht him from his own. And while the Lordly Master lyes without, [Enter Iren. Thou Trait'ress, Riotests with a Thief within. Iren. Ah Madam, what new Grief! Princess C. Alass Iren, Thou Treasurer of my thoughtsâ What shall I do? how shall I chase Nemours, That Robber, Ravisher of my Repose? Iren. For the great care you wish, may I enquire Whether you think the Duke insensible, Indifferent to the rest of Woman-kind? Princess C. I must confess I did not think him so Tho now I doâBut wou'd give half my Blood To think him otherwiseâ Iren. Without the Expense, There take your wish,âa Letter which he dropt In the Tennis-court, given the Queen Dauphin By her Page, and sent to you to read for your Diversion. Princess C. Alas! Irenâ Why trembles thus my Hand, why beats my Heart? But let us Readâ Readsâ Your affection has been divided betwixt me and another, you are Falseâa Traytor to the truest Loveânever see me moreâ Princess C. Ah 'tis too plain, I thought as much before; but Oh! we are too apt to excuse the faults of those we love, and fond of our own undoing. Support me Oh to bear this dreadful pang, This stab to all my gather'd Resolution. Iren. Read it agen, and call Revenge to aid you. Princess C. Perhaps he makes his boast too of the Conquest, For Oh! my Heart he knows too well, my Passionâ But as thou hast inspir'd me, I'll revenge The Affront, and cast him from my Poyson'd Breast, To make him room that merits all my thoughts. Enter the Prince of Cleve with Nemours. P. C. Madam there is a Letter fall'n by accident into your handsâmy Friend comes in behalf of the Vidam of Chartres to retrieve it, when I am dismiss'd from the King my Lord, I'll wait you here again. Nem. My Lordâ P. C. Not a step further. [Exit. P. C. Nem. Madam, I come most humbly to enquire, whether the Dauphin Queen sent you a Letter which the Vidam lost? Princess C. Sir, you had better Find the Queen Dauphin out, tell her the truth, For she's inform'd the Letter is your own. Nem. Ah Madam! I have nothing to confess In this Affairâor if I had, believe me, Believe these Sighs that will not be kept in, I shou'd not tell it to the Dauphin Queen. But to the purpose; Know my Lord of Chartres Receiv'd the Note you saw, from Madam Tournon, A former MistressâBut the Secret's thisâ The Sister of our Henry long has lov'd him. Princess C. I thought the King intended her for Savoy. Nem. True Madam, but the Vidam is belov'd; In short, he dropt the Letter, and desir'd, For fear of her he loves, that I wou'd own it; I promis'd too to trace the Business for him, And if 'twere possible, regain the Letter. Princess C. The Vidam then has shewn but small Discretion, Being engag'd so highâ Why did he not burn the Letter? Nem. But Madam, shall I dare presume to say, 'Tis hard to be in Love and to be wise? Oh did you know like himâlike him! Like me, What 'tis to languish in those restless Fires. Princess C. Iren, Iren, restore the Duke his Letter. [Enter Iren. Nem. Madam, You've bound me ever to your Service, But I'll retire and study to repay, If ought but death can quit the Obligation. [Exit. Princess C. O 'tis too much, I'm lost, I'm lost agenâ The Duke has clear'd himself, to the confusion Of all my settl'd Rage, and vow'd Revenge; And now he shews more lovely than before: He comes agen to wake my sleeping Passion, To rouze me into Torture; O the Racks Of hopeless Love! it shoots, it glows, it burns, And thou alas! shalt shortly close my Eyes. Iren. Alas! you're pale already. Princess C. Oh Irenâ Methinks I see Fate set two Bowls before me, Poyson and Health, a Husband and Nemours; But see with what a whirl my Passions move, I loath the Cordial of my Husband's Love; But when Nemours my Fancy does recal, The Bane's so sweet that I cou'd drink it all.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Tournon, La March. Tour. It works, my Dear, it works beyond belief, The Letter which he lost has sprung a Mine That shatters all the Court, each Jealous Dutchess Concludes her Man concern'd, and strait employs A Confident to find the Mystery out. But that which takes the Queen, and makes me dye With Pleasure, is, that Marguerite thinks Spite of the Imprecations of Nemours, The Letter sent to himâ La M. I see 'em move this way. Tour. Hast to St. Andre's Palace, watch their Wives, till I appearâ I have promis'd Nemours an Afternoon Assignation with 'em in Luxemburg Garden, but I will antedate the bus'ness as he is waiting, and set Marguerite upon him just as he meets 'em, which will heighten the design; be gone while I attend the bus'ness hereâ [Exit La March. Enter Marguerite, Nemours. Marg. Away, you have combin'd to ruine me, [The Vidam. You have conspir'd the Death of her you hate; But tell me, Oh! confess and I'll forgive thee; Say it was thine, nay, look not on the Vidam, There is Discourse in Eyes, Consent, Denial, All understood by looks, say it was thine, Confess, and lay this Tempest with a word. Not yet? why then I'll have it in despite Of thee and him, I'll sell my Soul to Hell, If Woman can be worth the Devil's purchase, After she has been blown upon by Man; That I may tell thee, as I sink for ever, Thou hast been False. Nem. You have heard me more than once Affirm, the Vidam (if you'll give him leave) Will own it to your Face. Marg. Hear, hear him Heav'n; By all Extreams thou art False, therefore be gone, For if I look upon thee in this Rage, I shall do mischief; speak not, but awayâ [Nemours beckens the Vidam, they steal off. Enter Tournon. Tour. Madam, the Duke has taken you at your word, and is gone with the Vidam; I made bold to over-hear part of your Discourse, because I have more of his Infidelity to tell youâBetwixt one and two in Luxemburg Garden he has appointed some Ladiesâ Marg. Furies and Hell!â Tour. Have Patience for an hour, I'll bring you to the place, where, if you please, you may flesh your Fingers in the Blood of those young Women, whom he meets to enjoy. Marg. No, no, I have a better Cast, if I can conquer this rising Spleenâ How long will it be e'er your call me? Tour. An hour or thereaboutsâ Marg. And by that time I'll put on a Disguise; fail notâ Tour. But what do you intend? Marg. I know not yet my self; Revengeâ Tour. You had a Lover once, Francis the Dauphinâ Marg. Be that then the last CardâI know not what; The Dauphin shallâI'll do't, and openly affront himâ And as the little Worshippers adore me, Spy the Duke out, and leaning on the Prince, Enquire who's that: It shall be so, I willâ Revenge, Revenge, and shew thy self true Woman. Down then, proud Heart, down Woman, down, I'll try, I'll do't, I've sworn, to curb my Will or dye. [Exeunt. SCENE II. St. Andre, Poltrot, Bellamore. Bell. Well, Gentlemen, good Morrow, and remember my Counsel. Pol. What, to bear our selves like Men of Wit and Sense, Snub our Wives, Rally 'em, and be as Witty as the Devil? St. A. With all my heart, 'tis not my time of Assignation yet with my Dutchesses, and this is very Fashionable. Bell. I've put you in the wayâAnd so good Morrow. [Exit. Pol. They come, they come, [Enter Elianor and Celia. Walk by 'em, take no notice, and Repeat Verses. Phillis did in so strange a Posture lye Panting and Breathless, languishing her Eye, She seem'd to live, and yet she seem'd to Dye. St. A. I grow sick of the WifeâPrithe Poltrot let's go. Pol. Whither thou wilt, so we get rid of 'emâZ'life I am as weary of mine, as a Modish Lady of her old Cloathsâ Cel. What does the Maggot bite, you must be jogging from this place of little Ease? yet I am resolv'd to know some reason, why a Wife may not be as good Company as a Wench. Pol. Prithe Spouseâdo not provoke me, for I'm in the Witty Vein, and shall Repartee thee to the Devil. El. Pray, St. Andre, leave trising your Curls, your affected Nods, Grimaces, taking of Snuff, and answer meâWhy are we not as pleasing as formerly? St. A. Why, NellâGad 'tis specialâThis Amarum is very pungent âWhy, Nell, I can give no more reason for my change of humour, than for the turning of a Weather-cock; only this, I love Whoring, because I love Whoring. Pol. Nay, since you provoke us, know I can give a reason; we run after Whores, because you bar us from 'emâAs some take pleasure to go a Deer-steeling that have fine Parks of their ownâGad, and there I was with herâThis itch of the Blood, Spouse, is nothing but a Spice of the first great Jilt your Grand-mother Eve; we long for the Fruit, because it is forbidden. St. A. Nay, that's not all, for Misses are really more pleasant than a Wife can be, Probatum est. A Wife dares not assume the Liberty of pleasing like a Miss, for fear of being thought one. A Wife may pretend to dutiful affection, and bustle below, but must be still at night. 'Tis Miss alone may be allow'd Flame and Rapture, and all thatâ Cel. Yet how do you know, but a Wife may have Flame and Rapture, and all thatâ Pol. 'Tis impossible, 'tis the Nature of a Wife to be as cold as a StoneâThere's Slap Dash for youâ Cel. Yet out of a Stone a Man of Sense wou'd strike Fire: There's Slap Dash for youâ El. Will you be Constant to us, if we make it appear by your own Confession, that we can please as well as the subtl'st She that ever charm'd you? St. A. Till which Miracle come to pass, since 'twas your own Proposition, I St. Andre and thou Elianor come not between a pair of Sheetsâ El. How shou'd they know then? Pol. Nor I Antony with thee Celia. El. But we hope you are not in earnest, you cannot be so Inhumane. Cel. 'Tis a Curse beyond all Curses, to have a Man that can and will not; 'tis worse than teaching a Fool, or leading the Blind. El. To Marry and live thus, is to be like Fish in Frosty Weather, have Water, but pine for want of Air. Cel. Yet, who knows but Heav'n may send some Kind Good Man, that in meer pity may break the Ice, and give us a Breathing? El. Can you be so hard-hearted? Pol. Come Bully, let's away, for fear we shou'd melt; look ye Spouses of ours, if our Wenches prove ill-humour'd, we'll come back to you. St. A. Agreed, rather than grow Rusty let our Wives File usâ But I thank Heav'n 'tis not come to that yetâThere's no such want, I'll have you to know Nell, there's no Woman can resist me if she wou'd, no Dutchess scapes me, if I make it my bus'ness to compass her. Pol. Any Man of Wit and Sense like us, Charms all Women, as one Key unlocks all Doors at CourtâNay, I'll say a bold word for my self, Turn me to the sharpest Shrow that ever Bit or Scratch'd, if I do not make her feed out of my hand like a tame Pidgeon, may I be condemn'd to lye with my Wife. Eli. Flesh and Blood can endure no longer, you are the vainest lying Fellows that ever liv'd, you compass a DutchessâThere's not a Footman but wou'd shame you. St. A. Z'Death and Fury, if they shou'd tryâ Cel. You pitiful, sneaking, rascally Cuckold, countenanc'd Scoundrels, that dare Bespatter Ladies of Honour thusâFor Heaven sake what are you, how do you live, and where do you spend your time? in Tennis-Courts, Taverns, Eating-houses, Bawdy-houses, where you quarrel in Drink for your Trulls, who while you Manfully Fight their Cause, they run away with your Hats and Beltsâ Eli. Then you come home, and swear you'll be reveng'd on this Lord, or that Duke, that assaulted you single, with all his Foot men. Cel. And, says my Gentleman, if I had not been the most Skillful Person alive, my Body had been by this time like an Old-fashion'd Suit, Pink'd all over, and full of Ilet-holes. Eli. But did he not disarm my Lord at last? Cel. By all means, and made him beg his Life. Eli. When indeed he compounded with the Constable for his own Liberty. Cel. You Persons of QualityâWhat Person of Honour wou'd keep company with such Debauches? Z'life Madam, an Orange-wench is above their Ambition. Eli. An Orange-wench! If they can but run in her debt, and the poor Creature come dunning 'em to their Lodgings, they'll Swear they lay with her, when they dare not be known that they are within. Cel. Sometimes lye Lolling upon a long Scarf in the Play-house, talking loud and affectedly, and Swear at night they had the prettiest thing just come out of the Country. Eli. And wish themselves Damn'd if she did not smell of the Grass. Cel. When in truth 'twas some disguis'd Bawd, that met 'em there according to Assignation. Pol. Heark you Potiphar's Wife of mine, by Pharaoh's lean Kine thou shalt starve for this. St. A. And for thee NellâMark me, thou shalt Dream and be tormented with Imagination, like one that having drunk hard is thirsty in the Night, dreams of Vessels brim-full, and drinks and drinks, yet never is satisfied. Pol. For my part, I'll serve my Damn'd Wife as Tantalus was punish'd the Fruit shall bob at her Lips, which she shall never enjoy. [Exeunt St. A. Pol. Eli. Very well, the World's come to a fine pass; if this be Marrying, wou'd I were a Maid agen. Men take Wives now as they snatch up a Gazette, look it over and then fling it by. Cel. They forget us in a day or two, or if they read us over agen, 'tis only to rub up Remembrance, and commonly they fall asleep so. Eli. What's to be done Child? for rather than live thusâ Cel. Rather than live thus let's do any thing. Eli. Any thing Rogue, why Cuckolds are things. Cel. Perhaps they think we have no such thing as Flesh and Blood about us, but we'll make 'em know, a young Woman in the flour of her Age, is not like painted Fruit in a Glass, only to be look'd onâ Perhaps you are a more Contemplative Person, and will go farther about. Eli. What, Dear Rogue, dost think I will leave thee? by this Kiss not I. Cel. Thus then we'll slip on long Scarfs, and black Gowns, put on Masks, and ramble about. Eli. Rare Rogue, let me Kiss thee agenâCertainly Intrigueing is the pleasantest part of Life; to meet a Gallant abroad in a Summers Evening, and Laugh away an hour or two in a Garden Bower, where no body sees nor no body knows, methinks 'tis so pretty and harmless, Lord, how it works in my Fancyâ Cel. We must tell Madam Tournon by all meansâ Eli. I believe her Secret, and know her very good Natur'd; but for all that, methinks she has the Cant of a refin'd Florence Bawdâ Enter Tournon. Cel. The better for our purpose, she comes as wish'd. Tour. Dear Precious Rosebuds your Servant, now for all the World you look as you were New-blown; and how do ye my pretty Primroses? 'tis a whole day since I saw ye. Cel. Oh Madam! we have a Suit to your Ladiship. Tour. I grant it whate'er it be; speak my Hyacinth. Eli. Our Husbands are worse than ever. Cel. They use us as if we had neither Beauty nor Portion. Tour. What's this I hear? O Ingrate and Ignoble! Revenge your selves Sweetingsâ'Tis time to pule and put Finger in Eye, when you are past Propagation. But my Lady-birds you are in your Prime, let me touch your delicate HandsâWell, and do not these humid Palms claim a ManâNay, and your Breasts, Lord! Lord! how swoll'n and hard they are, how they heave and pant now, by Cynthia, as if they were ready to burst? look to't, have a care of a Cancer, draw 'em down, draw 'em down, for let me tell you Jewels, it may be dangerous for you to go thus long without Cultivationâ Eli. What wou'd you have us do Madam? Tour. Do Violet? why do as all the World does beside, lose no Time, catch him by the Forelock, get a Man to your mindâI'll acquaint you with one that's as true as the day, that will Fight like a Lion, and Love like a SparrowâHe has Eyes as black as Slows, you can hardly look on 'em, and a Skin so whiteâand soft as Sattin with the Grain: And for thee Tulipâ Cel. For me Madam! Tour. For thee Hony-Suckle, such a Man, well, I shall never forget him, such a strait bole of a Body, such a Trunk, such a shape, such a quick strength, he will over any thing he can lay his hand on, and Vaults to Admiration. Eli. But Madam, will you provide us Lodgings on occasionâ Tour. The Richest in the Town, the costliest Hangings, great Glasses, China Dishes, Silver Tables, Silver Stands, and Silver UrinalsâAnd then these Gallants are the closest Lovers, so good at keeping a Secretâ Well, give me your Man that says nothing, but minds the bus'ness in handâFor a Secret Lover's like a Gun charg'd with White Powder, does Execution but makes no noise. Cel. Well, and let me tell you that's the Point, Madamâ Tour. Ay, and 'tis a Precious Point, a Feeling Point, and a Pleasing Point; you shall know him, you must know him, I shall dye if you don't know himâHe has the fling of a Gentleman. Eli. Pray Madam, how's that? Tour. Why thus ApricockâInto your Arms, then stops your Mouth with a double-tongu'd English Kiss, that you can't be angry with him for your Blood. Cel. I know 'tis my filthy Country wayâBut I'll assure you if he should serve me so, my Blood would rise at him. Tour. But then you'd repent and fall before him, for he has the most particular obliging way, and she whom he particularly, loves, is so oblig'd with his ParticularâWell, for my part, my Twins of Beauty, I set an infinite Value on their Charesses, Distresses and Addresses; nay, I cou'd refuse a Quilt Imperial, to be oblig'd by them, tho on the bare Boards, or the cold Stones. Eli. But, Madam, are they in beingâ Tour. They are my BlossomsâThen they Kiss beyond Imagination, just for all the World as when you cut a pure Juicy China Orange, the Goodness runs overâLord! now it comes in my Cogitation, I'm just now going to take a View of 'em in Luxemburg Garden, where, if you please to walk, they shall Sun themselves in your SmilesâCome my Carnations, nay, I protest I will not go before ye. Cel. But, Madam, we're at home. Tour. O Lord, Beauties! I know not the way. Eli. Indeed Madam you mustâor we shall use Violenceâ Tour. Well Ladies, since 'tis your command, I dare not but obey. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Nemours, Bellamore. Nem. Thou Dear Soft Rogue, my Spouse, my Hephestion, my Ganymed, nay, if I dye to night my Dukedom's thineâBut art thou sure the Princess of Cleve withdraws here after Dinnerâ Bell. One of her Women whom I have Debauch'd, tells me 'tis her Custom; you may slip into the Closet and over-hear all, and yet methinks 'tis hard, because the Prince of Cleve loves you as his Life. Nem. I sav'd his Life, Sweet-heart, when he was assaulted by a mistake in the dark, and shall he grudge me a little Fooling with his Wife, for so serious an Obligation? Enter the Vidamâ A Pox upon him, here comes the Vidam with his sowre Moralsâ Vid. 'Tis certain I like herâShe's very pretty, and Tournon shall help me to herâ Nem. In Love, by my LecheryâAy, and she shall help thee to herâ But who, but who is't my Man of Principlesâ Vid. To tell your Grace, I am sure were to be a Man of none for my selfâYou that are the Whores IngrosserâLet me seeâThere's Tournon your Ubiquitary Whore, your Bawd, your Bawd Barber or Bawd Surgeon, for you're ever under her hands, and she Plaisters you every day with new WenchesâThen there's your Domestick Termagant âElianor and Celia, with something new in ChaseâWhy you outdo Cesar himself in your way, and dictate to more Whores at once than he did to KnavesâBelieve me Sir, in a little time you'll be nick'd the Town Bull. Nem. Why there's the difference betwixt my Sense and yours; wou'd I were, and your Darklin Mistress the first shou'd come in my way, Jove and Europa, I'd leap her in thy FaceâWhy, how now Vidam, what Devil has turn'd thee Grave, the Devil of Love, or the Devil of Envy? Vid. Friendship, mere Friendship and care of your Soul; I thought it but just, to tell you the whole Town takes notice of your way. Nem. Why then the whole Town does me wrong, because I take no notice of theirs; thus t'other night I was in company with two or three well-bred Fops, that found fault with my Obscenity, and protested 'twas such a wayâWhy 'tis the way of ye all, only you sneak with it under your Cloaks like Taylors and Barbers; and I, as a Gentleman shou'd do, walk with it in my hand. For prithee observe, does not your Priest the same thing? did not I see Father Patrick declaiming against Flesh in Lent, strip up to the Elbow; and telling the Congregation he had eat nothing but Fish these twenty years, yet protest to the Ladies, that Fat Arm of his, which was a chopping one, was the least Member about him? Bell. Faith, and it may be so too. Nem. Does not your Politician, your little great Man of bus'ness, that sets the World together by the Ears, after all his Plotting, Drudging and Sweating at Lying, retire to some little Punk and untap at Night? Vid. I submit to the weight of your Reasons, and confess the whole World does you Injustice, wherefore I judge it fit that they bring your Grace their Wives and Daughters to make you amends. Nem. Why now thou talk'st like an honest Fellow, for never let bus'ness Flatter thee Frank into Nonsense: Women are the sole Pleasure of the World; nay, I had rather part with my whole Estate, Health and Sense, than lose an Inch of my LoveâI was t'other day at a pretty Entertainment, where two or three Grave Politick Rogues were wond'ring, why Women shou'd be brought into Plays; I as gravely reply'd, the World was not made without 'em; he full Pop upon meâBut Sir, it had been better if it hadâ Vid. And then no doubt a gloomy Smile aroseâ Nem. These are your Rogues, Frank, that wou'd be thought Criticks, that are never pleas'd but with something new, as they call it, just, proper, and never as men speak; you're out of the way, men that hate us Rogues with a wayâ Bell. But after all this they'll run you down, and say your Grace is no Scholarâ Nem. Why, Faith, nor wou'd be, if Learning must wrench a Man's Head quite round; I understand my Mother-tongue well enough, and some others just as I do Women, not to be married to 'em, but to serve my turn; what's good in 'em never scapes me, but as for Points and Tags, for which those solemn Fops are to be valued, I slight 'em, nor wou'd remember 'em if I cou'd; for he that once listens to Jingling, ten to one if ever he gets it out of his head while he livesâBut prithee be gone, and leave me to my Musing; find Tournon out, my Vidam, and bid her remember the HandkercherâAway, thou art concern'd in the bus'ness, therefore away. [Exeunt Vid. Bell. Enter the Princess of Cleve, Irene. Nem. She comes, ye Gods, with what a pompous State; The Stars and all Heav'ns Glories on her wait. That's out of the way tooâBut now for my Closet. [Exit. Princess C. No, no, I charge thee pity me no longer, But on the Earth let us consult our Woes: For Earth I shall be shortly; sit and hear me, While on thy Faithful Bosom thus I lean My akeing Head, and breath my cruel Sorrows. Iren. Speak Madam, speak, they'll strangle if contain'dâ Princess C. As late I lay upon a flow'ry Bank, My Head a little heav'd beyond the Verge, To look my Troubles in the Rockless Stream, I slept, and dreamt I saw The bosom of the Flood unfold; I saw the Naked Nymphs ten Fathom down, With all the Crystal Thrones in their Green Courts below, Where in their busie Arms Nemours appear'd: His Head reclin'd, and swoll'n as he were drown'd, While each kind Goddess dew'd his Senseless Face With Nectars drops to bring back Life in vain: When on a sudden the whole Synod rose And laid him to my LipsâOh my Irene! Forgive me Honour, DutyâLove forgive me, I found a Pleasure I ne'er felt before, Dissolving Pains, and Swimming shuddering Joys, To which my Bridal Night with Cleve was dullâ Enter the Prince of Cleve. Iren. Behold him, Madam. P. C. Ha! my ChartresâHowâ Why on the Earth? Princess C. Because, my Lord, it suits The humble posture of my sad Condition. P. C. These Starts agen, but why thy sad Condition? O rise and tell me why this Melancholy! Why fall those Tears? Why heaves this Bosom thus? Nay, I must then constrain thee with my Arms. [Rise. Is't possible? does then thy load of Grief Oppress thee so, thou canst not speak for Sighingâ Ah Chartres, Chartres! then thou didst but sooth me, There is some cause, too frightful to be told, And thou hast learnt the art too to dissemble. Princess C. O Heavens! dissemble when I strip my Soul, Shew it all bear, and trembling to your view; Can you suspect me Sir, for a Dissembler? P. C. By all my Hopes, Doubts, Jealousies and Fears, I know not what to think, I think thou show'st Thy inmost thought, and now I think thou dost not. I think there is a Bosom secret still, And have a dawn of it through all thy Folds That hide it from my view: O trust me Cleve! Trust me whate'er it be; I love thee more Than thou lov'st help for that which thus inthrauls thee. Trust thy Dear Husband, O let loose the pain That makes thee droop, though it shou'd be my death! By thy dear self I'll welcome it to ease thee. Princess C. Thou best of all thy Kind, why shou'd you rack me, Who dare not, cannot speakâNo more but this, Take me from Paris from the Court. P. C. Ha, Chartres, how! What from the Court of Paris, why? Princess C. Becauseâmy Mothers Death-bed Counsel so advised me, Because the Court has Charms, because I love A Grotto best, because 'tis best for you And me, and all the World. P. C. Because, O Heaven! Because there is some cursed Charm at Court, Which you love better than me and all the World. The Reason's plain, for which you wou'd remove, To lose the Mem'ry of some lawless Love. Princess C. Why then am I detain'd, if that's your fear? P. C. It is, it ought, and shall, and Oh! you must Confess this horrid Falshood to my Face. Princess C. Never, my Lord, never confess a Lye, By Heav'ns I love your Life above my own. P. C. Not that, not that, speak home and fly not wide, Swear by thy self, thou dearly purchas'd Pleasure, Swear by those Chaster Sweets thy Mother left thee; Swear that thy Soul, which cannot hide a Treason, Prefers me ev'n to all the World; Hold Precious, Swear that thou lov'st him moreâAnd only lov'st him, And in such Sense as not to love another. Princess C. Ah, Sir! why will you sink me to your Feet, Where I must lye and groan my Life away? P. C. Speak Chartes, Speak, nor let the name of Husband Sound Terror to thy Soul; for by my hopes Of Paradice, howe'er thou usest me, I am thy Creature, still to make and mould me Thy cringing crawling Slave, and will adore The hand that kills meâ Princess C. O you are too good! And I must never hope for PardonâYet I cou'd excuse it; but my Lord I will not. Know thenâI cannot speak. P. C. Nor I by Heav'n. Princess C. I Love. P. C. Go on. Princess C. I love you as my Soul. P. C. HaâBut the rest. Princess C. Alas, alas, I dare notâ P. C. Why then farewel for everâ Princess C. Stay and take itâ Take the extreamest Pang of tortur'd Vertue, Take all, I love, I love thee Cleve as Life; But Oh! I love, I love another moreâ P. C. Oh Chartres! Ohâ Princess C. Why did you rack me then? You were resolv'd, and now you have it all. P. C. All Chartres! All! Why, can there then be more? But rise, and know I by this Kiss forgive thee. Thou hast made me wretched by the clearest proof Of perfect Honour that e'er flow'd from Woman. But crown the misery which you have begun, And let me know who 'tis you wou'd avoid, Who is the happy man that had the power To burn that Heart which I cou'd never warm. Princess C. Forgive me Sir, in this Prudence commands Eternal silenceâ P. C. Ha! if silent now, Why didst thou speak at all? If here thou stop'st I shall conclude that which I thought thy vertue, A start of passion which thou cou'dst not hide, And now Vexation gnaws thy guilty Soul With a too late Repentance for confessing His nameâ Princess C. You shall not know itâYes my Lord, Now a too late Repentance tears my Soul, And tells me I have done amiss to trust you; Yet by my hopes of ease at last by Death, I swear my Love has never yet appear'd To any Man but youâ P. C. Weep not my Chartres, for howe'er my Tongue Upbraid thy Fame, my Heart still worships thee, And by the Blood that chills me roundâI swear From this sad Moment, I'll ne'er urge thee more; All that I beg of thee, is not to hate me. Princess C. The study of my Life shall be to love you. P. C. Never, Oh never! I were mad to hope it, Yet thou shalt give me leave to fold thy hand, To press it with my Lips, to sigh upon it, And wash it with my Tearsâ Princess C. I cannot bear this kindness without dying. P. C. Nay, we will walk and talk sometimes together, Like Age we'll call to mind the Pleasures past; Pleasures like theirs, which never shall return, For Oh! my Chartres, since thy Heart's estrang'd, The pleasure of thy Beauty is no more, Yet I each night will see thee softly laid, Kneel by thy side; and when thy Vows are paid, Take one last kiss, e'er I to Death retire, Wish that the Heav'ns had giv'n us equal fire; Then sigh, it cannot be, and so expire. Exeunt. Enter Nemours. She Loves, she Loves, and I'm the happy Man, She has avow'd it, past all president, Before her Husbands Faceâ Ha! but from Love like hers such daring virtue, That like a bleeding Quarry lately chas'd, Plunges among the Waves, or turns at Bay, What is there to expectâButâlet it come The worst can happ'n, yet 'tis glorious still. To bring to such Extreams so chast a mind, And charm to love the wisest of her Kind. Enter Vidam. Ah Vidam! I cou'd tell thee such a Story of such a Friend of mine, the oddest, prettiest, out of the way of bus'ness, but thou art so flippant there's no trusting thee. Vid. Tournon says the Flag's held outâ Nem. Tournon be Damn'dâKnow then, but be secret, there is a Friend of mine belov'dâBut by a Soul so Vertuous, Vid. That was too muchâ Nem. That quite from the method of all Womankind, she told it to her Husband. Vid. That's strange indeed: And how did her Husband like it? Nem. Why, after a tedious passionate Discourse, approved her carriage, and swore he lov'd her more than ever; so they cry'd and kiss'd, and went away most lovingly together. Vid. Why then she Cuckolds him to rights, nor can he take the Law of her; and I'll be judge by any Bawd in ChristendomâAnd so my Lord farewell, I have bus'ness of my own, and Tournon waits youâ Nem. But heark you, Frank, I have occasion for you, and must press thee, I hope, to no unwellcome Officeâonly a Secondâ Vid. With all my heart, my Lord, the time and place. Nem. Just now in Luxemburg Garden, betwixt one and two, a Challenge from a couple, the smartest, briskest, prettiest Tilting Ladiesâ Vid. Your Servant Sir, and as you thrive, let me hear from your Grace, and so Fate speed your Plow. [Exit. Enter Tournon with Marguerite. Nem. And so Fate speed your Plow, and you go to that, and I shall tell you Sir, 'twas not handsomly done, to leave me thus to the Mercy of two unreasonable Women at once. Tour. You have him now in view, and so I leave you. [Exit. Tour. Marg. Stand Sir. Nem. To a Lady, while I have breath. Marg. Wou'd you not fall to a Lady too, if she shou'd ask the Favour? Nem. Ay, Gad, any pretty Woman may bring me upon my Knees at her pleasure. Marg. O Devilâ Nem. Prithee my dear soft warm Rogue, let thee and I be kindâ Marg. And Kiss, you were going to say. Nem. Z'Life, how pat she hits me, why thou and I were made for one anotherâLet's try how our Lips fit. Marg. Is that your fitting? Nem. 'Fore Heaven she's wond'rous quick; Nay, my Dear, and you go to that, I can fit you every wayâ Marg. You are a notorious talker. Nem. And a better doer; prithee try. Marg. As if that were to do now. Nem. Nay then I'm sure of thee, for never was a Woman mine once, but was mine always. Marg. Know then you are a heavy sluggish Fellow; but I see there is no more Faith in Man than Woman, Cork and Feathers. Nem. Make a Shittlecork that's Woman, let me, if you please, be Battledoor, and by Gad for a day and a night I'll keep up with my Fellow in Christendom. Marg. Come away then and I'll keep count I warrant youâMonsterâ Villainâ Nem. Now is the Devil and I as great as everâI come my Dearâ But then what becomes of my other DearsâFor whom I was Prim'd and Charg'dâ Marg. Why dont you come my Dear? Nem. There with that sweet word she cock'd meâ Marg. Lord! how you trembleâ Nem. There the Pan flash'dâ Marg. I'll set my Teeth in you. Nem. Now I go offâO Man! O Woman! O Flesh! O Devil! Finis Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Vidam, Tournon. Tour. A woman in Love with another, and confess it to her Husband âWhat wou'd I give to know herâWithout all question Nemours is the Person belov'd. Vid. That's plain by his eagerness in the Discovery, he forc'd me to hear him whether I wou'd or no; yet what I so admire in his Temper, is, that for all the former Heat, I no sooner mentioned you, but he flew from it, and run upon another Scent, as if the first had never been. Tour. Where did you find him? Vid. At the Princess of Cleve's, and my Heart tells me that's the Lady that acquainted her Husband how she was determin'd to make him a CuckoldâIf he pleas'd to give his consentâ Tour. My Judgment, which is most Sagacious in these Matters, is most positive in your opinion, for by his whitely cast, the Prince of Cleve must be the Man fork'd in the Book of Fateâ Vid. And yet 'tis odd, that Nemours of all Men, shou'd have such luck at this Lottery. Tour. O to choose, my Lord! because she's nice and precise; your demure Ladies that are so Squob in company, are Devils in a corner; they are a sort of melancholy Birds, that ne'er peep abroad by day, but they to whit, to whou it at night; nay, to my particular knowledge, all grave Women love wild Men, and if they can but appear civil at first, they certainly snap 'em; for mark their Language, the Man is a handsom Man, if he had but Grace; the Man has Wit, Parts and excellent Gifts, if he wou'd but make a right use of 'em; why all these If's are but civil Pimps to a most Bawdy conclusionâBut see, I descry him with a Mask yonderâ Vid. You'll remember St. Andre's Lady for this Discovery. Tour. If she be not yours to night, never acquaint me with a Mystery agenâ Vid. Not a word to the DukeâMy Gravity gets me a hank over himâTherefore if you tell him of any Love Matters of mine, you must never hope for more Secretsâ Tour. Trouble not your head, but away. [Exit. Vid. So this gets me a Diamond from the Queen, an Embassadors Merit at least. Confess to her Husband, alas poor PrincessâSee, they come; but that which startles me, is how a Woman of Marguerite's Sex can contain all this while as she seems to do; but perhaps she designs to pump himâ Or has some further end, which I must learn. Enter Nemours and Marguerite. Marg. But did you never promise thus before? Nem. NeverâBut why these DoubtsâThou hast all the Wit in the WorldâThou know'st I love thee without Protestations, why then this delay? Marg. I have not convers'd with you an hour, and you are for running over me: No Sir, but if you can have patience till the BallâOh I shall burstâ Nem. Patience, I must; but if it were not for the clog of thy Modesty, we might have been in the third Heav'n by this, and have danc'd at the Ball besideâHa! you faintâTake off your Maskâ Marg. Unhand me, orâBut pray, e'er we part, let me ask you a serious question; what if you shou'd have pick'd up a Devil Incarnate? Nem. Why, by your loving to go in the dark thus, I make me begin to suspect youâBut be a Devil and thou wilt, if we must be Damn'd together, who can help itâ Marg. I shall not holdâ Nem. Yet, now I think on't, thou canst be no Devil, thou art so fraid of a Sinner; for you refus'd me just now, when I profer'd to sell my self, and seal the Bargain with the best of my Blood. Marg. But if I shou'd permit you, cou'd you find in your heart to ingender with a damn'd Spirit? Nem. Yes marry cou'd I, for all you ask the question so seriously: For know, thou bewitching Creature, I have long'd any time this seven years to be the Father of a Succubusâ Marg. Fiend, and no Manâ Nem. Besides, Madam, don't you think a feat Devil of yours and my begetting, wou'd be a prettier sight in a House, than a Monkey or a Squirrel? Gad I'd hang Bells about his neck, and make my Valet spruce up his Brush Tail ev'ry Morning as duly as he comb'd my head. Marg. But is it possible (for I know you have a Mistress, a Convenience as you call her,) that you cou'd leave her for me, who may be Ugly, Diseas'd, or a Devil indeed for ought you know? Nem. Why, since you tax me with truth, I must answer like a Man of Honour; I cou'd leave her for thee or any else of your Tribe, so they were all like youâ Marg. But in the name of Reason, what is there in us Runners at All, that a Wife, or a Mistress of that nature, may not possess with more advantage? Nem. Why, the freedom Wit and Roguery, and all sort of acting, as well as Conversation. In a Domestick she, there's no Gaity, no Chat, no Discourse, but of the Cares of this World and its Inconveniencies; what we do we do, but so dully; by Gad, my Thing ask'd me once, when my Breeches were down, what the Stuff cost a YardâHa! what now, upon the Gog agen? nay, then have with you at all Adventures, at least to put you in mind of the Ballâ [Exeunt. Enter Tournon. Tour. Ha! yonder she lost himâsee, what can she intend by keeping her self so closeâBut see La March has seiz'd her, and now the Mystery will open of it self. Re-enter Marguerite with La March. La M. But have you found him false? Tour. Curses, Damnation, The Racks of Womens Wits, when her Soul Is bawk'd of Vengeance, wait on his desires. La M. Why did you leave him so upon the sudden? Marg. Because I found my Passion move too strongly, My foolish Heart wou'd not obey my Will; I found my Eyes grow full, my Sighs had choak'd me, And I was dying in his Armsâ La M. But now You have got Breath, what is your purpose Madam? Nem. To meet him as I promis'd, to enjoy him With the last Pang of a revengeful Pleasure; And let him knowâ Then make him Damn himself with thousand Oaths, That he'll ne'er see forsak'n Marguerite more, The curst fond, foolish, doting Marguerite; For thus with an extorted Gallantry, I'll force him to revile me to my face; Then throw the Mask away, and vent my Rage; Tell him he is a Fiend, Devil, Devil, Devil, Or what is worse, a Manâ And leave him to the Horror of his Soul. [Exit. Tour. I've heard her Rave, and must applaud thy Conduct To the next task, then when she has satisfied This odd Figary of Revenge and Pleasure, Take her in the height of her disdain And ply her with the Dauphin; then tell Nemours Of her resolve to cast him further off, Millions to one we carry the design. But hast and scout, while I attend the Duke, That harps upon the loss of his new Mistress. Enter Nemours. Nem. Death and the DevilâWe went talking along so pleasantly, when of a sudden whisp'ring, she wou'd not fail me at the Ball, she sprung from me at yon dark corner and vanish'd. Well if she be a Devil, Hell by her shou'd be a merry place, or perhaps she has not been there yet, but fell this Morning and took Earth in her way; my Comfort is, I shall make a new discovery if she keeps her word, and she has too much wit to break it before she tryes me. Tour. And where are you to make this new discovery? Nem. At the Ball in MasqueradeâThus wou'd I have Time rowl still all in these lovely Extreams, the Corruption of Reason being the Generation of Wit; and the Spirit of Wit lying in the Extravagance of Pleasure: Nay, the two nearest ways to enter the Closet of the Gods, and lye even with the Fates themselves, are Fury and SleepâTherefore the Fury of Wine and Fury of Women possess me waking and sleeping; let me Dream of nothing but dimpl'd Cheeks, and laughing Lips, and flowing Bowls, Venus be my Star, and Whoring my House, and Death I defie thee. Thus sung Rosidore in the UrnâBut where and when, with my Fops Wives, be quick, thou know'st my appointment with this unknown, and the Minute's precious. Tour. Why, I have contriv'd you the sweetest Wight in the World, if you dare. Nem. Dare, and in a Woman's Cause! why, I have no drop of Blood about me, but must out in their service, and what matter is't which way? Tour. Know Poltrot's Lady has inform'd me, how St. Andre walks in his sleep, and that her Husband last night attempted to Cuckold him, that she watch'd and overheard the whole matter, but Poltrot cou'd not find the door before St. Andre return'd; she doubts not but he will try agen to nightâNow if you can nick the time when Poltrot rises, and steal to her, ten to one but she'll be glad to be reveng'dâ Nem. Or she wou'd not have told thee the bus'nessâThere wants but speaking with her, taking her by the hand, and 'tis a bargainâ Enter Celia, Elianora Mask'd. Poltrot, St. Andre following. Tour. Step, step aside, they are upon the hunt for you, and their Husbands have 'em in the wind; stand by a while to observe, and I'll turn you loose upon 'emâ St. A. Ha, Tournon! by my Honour a Prize, let's board 'em. Pol. Be not too desperate my little Frigat, for I am, that I am, a Furious Man of Honour. Cel. Now Heav'n defend us, what will you give us a Broad-side? El. Lord! how I dread the Guns of the lower Tire. St. A. Such notable Marks-men too, we never miss hitting between Wind and Water. Cel. I'll warrant they carry Chain-shot; Pray Heav'n they do not split us Sister! Pol. Yield then, yield quickly, or no Mercy, we have been so shatter'd to day already by two she Pirates, that we are grown desperate. El. But what alas have we done, that you shou'd turn your Revenge upon us poor harmless Innocents, that never wrong'd you, never saw you before? Cel. If you shou'd deal unkindly with us, 'twou'd break our Hearts, for we are the gentlest things. St. A. And we will use you so gently, so kindly, like little Birds, you shall never repent the loss of your Liberty. El. I'll warrant Sister they'll put us in a Cage, or tye us by the Legs. Pol. No, upon the word of a Man of Honour, your Legs shall be at liberty. Cel. What will you Pinnion our Wings then, and let us hop up and down the House? St. A. Not in the House where we live, pretty Soul, for there's two ravenous Sow-Cats will Eat you. El. Your Wives you mean. Pol. Something like, two Melancholy things that sit purring in the Chimney-corner, and to exercise their spite, kill Crickets. Cel. Oh! for God-sake keep us from your Wives. St. A. I'll warrant thee little Rosamond, safe from my jealous Elianorâ Pol. And if any Wife in Europe dares but touch a hair of thee, I say not much, but that Wife were better be a Widow. El. But are your Wives handsome and well qualited? for whatever you say to us, when you have had your will you'll home at night, and for my part I cry All or none. Pol. And All thou shalt have dear Rogue, never fear my Wive's Beauty or good Nature, they are things to her like Saints and Angels, which she believes never were nor never will beâShe's a Bason of Water against Lechery, and looks so sharp whenever I see her, like Vinegar she makes me sweat. St. A. And mine's so fulsome, that a Goat with the help of Cantharides wou'd not touch her. Cel. But then for their Qualitiesâ St. A. Such Scolds, like Thunder they turn all the Drink in the Cellar. Pol. Such Niggards, they eat Kitchin-stuff and Candles endsâOnce indeed raving mad my Wife seem'd Prodigal, for a Rat having eat his way through an old Cheese, she baited a Trap for him with a piece of pareingâBut having caught him, by the Lord she eat him up without mercy tail and all. El. Are they not ev'n with us Sister? St. A. 'Tis hop'd tho, the Hangman will take 'em off of our hands, for they are shroadly suspected for Witches, mine noints her self ev'ry Night, sets a Broom-staff in the Chimny, and op'ns the Window, for what purpose but to fly? Pol. Gad, and my Wife has Tets in the wrong place, she's warted all over like a pumpl'd Orange. Cel. Yet sure, Gentlemen, you told these Hags another story once, and made as deep Protestations to them as you do to us? St. A. Never by this hand, the Salt Souls fell in Lust with us, and haul'd us to Matrimony like Bears to the Stake. Pol. Where they set a long black thing upon us, that cry'd Have and Hold. El. Put the question they had been Handsome, brought you great Portions, were Pleasant and Airy and willing to humour you. Enter Nemours with the Vidam. Nem. Nay then I can hold no longer: Z'death, there's it Madam, Willing! That Willingness spoils all my Dear, my Hony, my Jewel, it Palls the Appetite like Sack at MealsâGive me the smart disdainful she, that like brisk Champaign or spritely Burgundy, makes me smack my Lips after she's down, and long for t'other-Glass. St. A. Nay if your Grace come in there's no dallying, I'll make sure of one. Pol. Nay, and for my part I am resolv'd to secure another; come Madam no striving, for I am like a Lion, when I lay hold, if the Body come not willingly, I pull a whole Limb awayâ Nem. Yes Madam, he speaks truth, take it on my word who am a rational Creature, he is a great furious wild Beast. Cel. Pray Heav'n he be not a horned Beast, is the Monster married? Vid. Yes Ladies, they are both married. El. Married! For Heav'n sake, Gentlemen, save us from the Cattle. Pol. Why, what is the Breeze in your Tails? Z'death Ladies we'll not eat you. Cel. Say you so? But we'll not trust you, I am sure you both look hungrily. Vid. It may be their Wives use 'em unkindly. El. And the poor good-natur'd things take it to heart. Cel. I swear 'tis pity, they have both promising looks. Nem. Proceed, sweet Souls, we'll defend you to death, spare 'em not. El. Or it may be we mistake all this while, and their pitiful looks are caused by loving too much. Vid. Right Madam, a little too Uxorious; Ha, Ha! St. A. Now have not I one word to say, but stand to endure all Jerks like a School-boy with my Shirt up. Pol. I'll have one fling at 'em tho' I dye for't; why Ladies you'll over-shoot your selves at this rateâMust we only be the Butts to bear all your Railery? methinks you might spend one Arrow at random, and take off that Daw that Chatters so near youâGad, and I think I paid 'em thereâ Cel. Butts and Daw! Let me never Laugh agen, if they be not Witty tooâWhy, you pleasant Rogues, Z'life I cou'd Kiss 'em if they did not stink of Matrimony. St. A. Mum, Mum, Mum. Did not I tell you 'twas a madness to speak to 'em? El. They envy my Friend too here, this pleasant Companion. Cel. This dear agreeable Person. Nem. Ay, Damme Madam, the Rogues envy usâ El. What a gentle Aspect? Cel. How proper and Airy? El. See, here's Blood in this Face. Vid. Pure Blood, Madam, at your Service. Cel. Will you walk dear Sir? give me your handâ El. And me yoursâ Nem. Come you dear ravishing RoguesâYour Servant Mr. Buttsâ Vid. Gentle Mr. Buttsâ El. Adieu sweet Mr. Butts. Cel. Witty Mr. Butts, Ha, Ha, Ha! [Exeunt Nem. Vid. Cel. El. St. A. Well, I'll to a Dutchess. Pol. Lord! thou art always so high-flownâHast thou never a cast Countess for meâ St. A. Come along to the Ball and thou shalt see, the Duke of Nemours is the Gallant to nightâand Treats at his Palace, because 'tis the King's Birth-dayâLet me see, what new Fancy for the Masquerade? Oh! I have itâBecause the Town is much taken with Fortune-telling, I'll act the Dumb Man, the Highlander that made such a noise, and thou shalt be my InterpreterâCome along, and as we go I'll instruct thee in the Signs. Pol. Dear Rogue, let's practise a little before we stirâAs what sign for Lechery, because we may Nick our Wives. St. A. Why thus, that's a glanting squeez'd Eyeâor thusâfor a moist Hand, or thus, for a Whore in a corner, or thus for downright Cuckolding. Pol. Well, I swear this will be rare sport, and so my damn'd Spouse, I am resolv'd to tickle her with a squeez'd Eye and a moist Hand; and a Whore in a corner till she confess her self guilty of downright Cuckoldom; then in revenge for her last Impudence, Sue for a Divorce: And holding to her Face the flying Label, Call her in open Court the Whore of Babel. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Prince and Princess of Cleve. P. C. Madam, the King commands me to attend His Daughter into Spain, and further adds, Because no Princess Rivals you in Fame, You will oblige the Court in going with me. Princess C. My Lord, I am prepar'd, and leave the Court With such a Joy as wou'd admit no boundsâ P. C. As wou'd admit no bounds! and why? because It takes you from the Charms which you wou'd shun: This is a Vertue of such height indeed, As none but you can boast nor I deplore. But Madam, Rumor says the King intends To joyn another with me. Princess C. Who my Lord? P. C. 'Twas thought at first the Chevalier de Guise. Princess C. He is your Friend, nor cou'd the King choose better. P. C. I say at first 'twas thought the Duke of Guiseâ But I was since instructed by the Queen, That Honour's fixt upon the Duke Nemours. Princess C. Nemours my Lord? P. C. Most certain. Princess C. For what reason? P. C. Because I mov'd the Dauphin Queen to gain him. Princess C. 'Twas rashly done, against your Interest mov'd. P. C. Perhaps 'tis not too late yet to supplant him. Princess C. Do't then, be quick, Nemours will share your Honours, Eclipse your Gloryâ P. C. HaâI must confess The Soldiers love him, and he bears the Palm Already from the Marshals of the Field. Princess C. And in the Court he's call'd the Rising Star: You see eacyh night at every Entertainment Where he moves, what Troops of Beauties follow; How the Queens praise him, and all Eyes admire himâ P. C. Ha! Chartresâ Princess C. Ah! my Lordâwhat have I done? P. C. Nothing, my Chartres, but admire Nemours! O Heaven and Earth! and if I had but Patience To hear you out, how had you lost your self On that Eternal Object of your Love? No Madam, no, 'tis false, 'tis no Nemours: 'Twas my invention to find out the truth, Your trouble has convinc'd me 'tis Nemours: Which curst Discovery in another Woman, I shou'd have made by her too eager Joy. Why speak you Not? you're shock'd with your own Vertue, The resolution of your Justice aws you, Which cannot, dares not give it self the Lye. Princess C. My Lord, my Love, my Life; Alas my Cleve! O pity me! I know not what to answer, I'm mortally asham'd, I'm on the Rack; But spare this humble PassionâTake me with you, Where I may never see a Man again. P. C. O Rise my Chartres! Rise if possible; I'll force thee to be mine in spite of Fate: My constant Martyrdom and deathless Kindness, My more than Mortal Patience in these Sufferings, Shall poize his noblest Qualities, O Heav'n! No fear, my Chartres, tho these Sorrows fall, That I suspect thy Glory; thou hast strength To curb this Passion in, that else may end us. All that I ask thee, is to bend thy Heart. Princess C. I'll break it. P. C. Turn it from Nemours, Nemoursâ But Oh! that name presents thy danger greater, Look to thy Honour then, and look to mine; I ask it as thy Lover and thy Husband; I beg it as a Man whose Life depends Upon thy Breath, that offers thee a Heart All bleeding with the Wounds of Mortal Love, All hack'd and gash'd, and stab'd and mangled o'er, And yet a Heart so true, in spite of pain, As ne'er yet lov'd, nor ever shall again. [Exit P. C. Enter Irene. Iren. Ha! Madam, speak, how is it with your Heart? Princess C. As with a timorous Slave, condemn'd to Torments, That still cries out, he cannot, will not bear it, And yet bears on. Iren. Ah, Madam! I wou'd speak, If you cou'd bear the dreadful News I bring. Princess C. Alas! thou canst not add to grief like mine. Iren. May I demand then, if you have not told The Secret to your Husband? Princess C. Ha! Irenâ Why dost thou ask? Iren. Because but nowâTournon, a Lady of the Queens, Told me 'tis blaz'd at CourtâNemours confessed He is belov'd by one of such nice Virtue, That fearingâlest the Passion might betray her, She own'd, confess'd, and told it to her Husband. Princess C. Death and DespairâBut does Nemours avow it? Iren. He own'd it to the Vidam, who agen Told it to Madam Tournonâshe to others; 'Tis true, Nemours told not the Ladies name, Nor wou'd confess himself to be the Party, But yet the Court in general does believe it. Princess C. I am undoneâmy Fame is lost for ever, And death, Irene, must be my remedy; 'Tis true, indeed, I laid my Bosom op'n, I shew'd my Heart to that ungrateful Cleve, Who since in dangerous search of him I love, To the eternal ruine of my Honour, Has trusted a third PersonâBut away I hear his tread, and am resolv'd to tax him. Enter Princess C. Ah! Sir, what have you done? if you must kill me, Are there not Daggers Pois'nâBut the Jealous Are Cruel still, and thoughtful in Revenge; And single Death's too little; must your will Of knowing Names, my duty durst not tell you, Oblige you to betray me to another; So to divulge the Secret of my Soul, That the whole Court must know it? P. C. Ha! know what? Know my Dishonour, have you told it then? Princess C. No, 'tis your self, 'tis you reveal'd it Sir, To gain a Confident for more Discovery, A Lady of the Queen's just now declar'd it, To your eternal Shame you have divulg'd it, She had it from the Vidam, Sir, of Chartres, And he from the Duke Nemoursâ P. C. Nemoursâ How, Madam, said youâWhat NemoursâNemours! Does Nemours know you love him? Hell and Furies! And that I know it too, and not revenge it! Princess C. That's yet to seek, he will not own himself To be concern'd, he offers not at names, But yet 'tis found, 'tis known, believ'd by all, He cannot hold it, 'twill be shortly posted, That Cleve your Wife's that curst dishonour'd She You told him ofâ P. C. Is't possible I told him? Peace, Peace, and if it lyes in Humane Power To reason calmly, tell me Murd'ress, tell me, Compose that Face of flush'd Hypocrisie, And answer to a truthâWas it my Interest To speak of this? was I not rather ty'd To wish it buried in the Grave in Hell! Whence it might never rise to blot my Honourâ But you have seen him, by my hopes of Heaven, You have met and interchang'd your secret Souls; On that Complotted; since I bore so tamely Your first Confession, I shou'd bear the latter, Princess C. Believe it if you pleaseâ P. C. I must believe itâ This last Proceeding has unmask'd your Soul, He sees you ev'ry hour, and knows you love him: Nay, for your greater freedom, you have joyn'd To make this loath'd detested Cleve your Stale. HaâI believ'd you might o'ercome this passion, So well you knew to Charm me with the show Of seeming Vertue, 'till I lost my Reason. Princess. C. 'Tis likely Sir, it was but seeming Vertue, And you did ill to judge so kindly of meâ I was mistaken too in that Confession, Because I thought that you wou'd do me Justice. P. C. You were mistaken when you thought I wou'd, Sure you forgot that I was desperate, Sentenc'd and doom'd by Fate, or rather damn'd To love you to my GraveâAnd cou'd I bear A Rival, what and when I was your Husband, And when you own'd your passion to my face, Confess'd you lov'd me muchâBut lov'd him more: HaâIs not this enough to make me mad? Princess C. You have the power to set all right agen, Why do you not end me? P. C. No, I'll end my self, My Toughts are grown too violent for my Reason. By this last usage, Oh! Thou hast undone me; I know not whatâThis ought not to be thineâ I have offended and wou'd Sue for pardon; But yet I blush, the Treason is too gross; After that most unnatural Confession, I wonder now that I have liv'd so long: Confess and then divulge, make me your Bawdâ It Scents too far, the God of Love flies wide, He gets the Wind, and stops the Nose at this; No moreâFarewelâFalse Chartres, False Nemours, False World, False All, since Chartres is not true! But you your With with lov'd Nemours shall have, And shortly see your Husband in the Grave. [Exit. Princess C. Sola. False World, False Cleve, False Chartres, False Nemours, Farewel to all, a long and last Farewel: From all Converse, to Deserts let me fly, And in some gloomy Cave forgotten lye. My Bower at Noon the shade of some old Trees With whistl'ing Winds t'endulge my pomp of ease, And lulling Murmurs rowl'd from neighb'ring Seas. Where I may sometimes hasten to the Shore, And to the Rocks and Waves my Loss deplore: Where when I feel my hour of Fate draws on, Lest the false World shou'd claim a parting groan; My Mothers Ghost may rise to fix my mind, And leave no thought of tenderness behind.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Musick, Songs, Maskers, &amp;c. Nemours with Musick, Lady Poltrot. Nem. He has confess'd to me he intends to Cuckold St. Andre when he walks in his sleepâTherefore if Love shou'd inspire me to nick the opportunity, I hope you will not bar the door which your Husband op'nsâ L. Pol. Ingrateful Monsterâ Nem. Ingrateful, that's certain, and it lyes in your power to make him a Monster. L. P. I dare not. Nem. What? L. P. Trust you. Nem. Nay then I am sure thou wilt, let me but in to shew the power you have over me. L. P. As how my Lord? Nem. Why, when I have thee in my Arms, by Heav'n I'll quit my Joys at thy desireâ L. P. That will indeed be a perfect tryal of your love; come then through the Garden back-stairs, and when you see the Candle put out, thrust op'n the door. Nem. By Heav'n I'll eat thy handâThou dear sweet Seducer, how it fires my Fancy to steal into a Garden, to rustle through the Trees, to stumble up a narrow pair of back stairs, to whisper through the hole of the door, to kiss it open, and fall into thy Arms with a flood of Joyâ L. P. Farewel, the company comes, I must leave you a while, to engage with my Husband, you'll fall asleep before the hourâ Nem. If I do, the very transport of Imagination shall carry me in my sleep to thy Bed, and I'll wake in the Act. [Exit L. Pol. So there's one in the Fernbrake, and if she stir till Morning I have lost my aim; but now, why what have we here? a Hugonot Whore by this lightâHave I? For the forward brisk, she that promis'd me the Ball Assignation, that said, there was nothing like slipping out of the crowd into a corner, breathing short an Ejaculation, and returning as if we came from ChurchâLet me see, I'll put on my Mask, fling my Cloak over my shoulder, and view 'em as they pass, not thou nor thouâ Enter Tournon in the Habit of a Hugonot. Tour. Ah thou unclean Person, have I hunted thee there like a Hart from the Mountains to the Vallies, and thou would'st not be found; verily thou hast been amongst the Daughters of the PhilistinesâNay, if you are Innocent, stand before me, and reply to the words of my mouthâ Nem. I shall trulyâ Tour. Say thenâHast thou not defil'd thy self with any Dalilah, since last you felt upon my Neck and loved much? Nem. Nay verilyâ Tour. Have you not overheated your Body with adulterate Wines? have you not been at a Play, nor touch'd Fruit after the leud Orange Women? Nem. I am unpolluted. Tour. And yet methinks there is not the same colour in your cheeks; nor does the Spirit dance in your Eye as formerly, why do you not approach me? [Unmasking. Nem. Tournon turn'd Heretick! why thou dear Raskal, this is such a new Frolick, that though I am engag'd as deep as Damnation to another, thou shalt not 'scape me. [Marg. claps him on the shoulder. Mar. I love a Man that keeps the Commandment of his word. Nem. And I a Woman that breaks hers with her Husband, yet loves her Neighbour as her selfâI wou'd fain be in private with you. Cel. And I with you, because I am resolv'd never to see you more. Nem. Never to see me more? the reason. Cel. Because I hate you. Nem. And yet I believe you love me too, because you are precise to the Minute. Cel. True, yet I hate you justly, heartily and maliciouslyâ Nem.

Poltrot coming up to 'emâ Elia. But is it true indeed, that your Friend can tell all the actions of our Life past, present, and to come, yet cannot speak one word? Pol. O he's infallible! why what did you never hear of your second-sight men, your Dumb High-landers that tell Fortunes? why you wou'd think the Devil in Hell were in him, he speaks exactly. Elia. I thought you had said he was Dumb? Pol. Right, but I am his Interpreter, and when the fit comes on him, he blows through me like a Trunk, and strait I become his speaking Trumpet. L. P. Pray, Sir, may not I have my Fortune told me too? Pol. Ayâand there were a thousand of you, he will run you 'em over like the Christ cross-row, and never miss a tittle; he shall tell ye his name that cry'd God bless you when you sneez'd last, tell you when you wink'd last, when and where you scratch'd last, and where you sate o' Saturdayâ Elia. Pray let him tell us then, for we are Sisters, our Tempers and Conditions, whither married or unmarried, with all the Impertinences thereunto belongingâ Pol. I'll speak to himâSon of the Sun, and Emperor of the Starsâ St. A. Ha, Haâ Pol. Look ye, look ye, he's pleas'd to tell you, but you must go near him, for he must look in your hand, touch your Face, Breasts, and where-ever else he pleases. St. A. âMakes Horns with both his hands, puts his Finger in his Mouth and Laughs. Pol. In nomine domine Bomine. I protest I am confounded; well Ladies, I cou'd not have thought it had been in you, but 'tis certainly true, and I must out with it; first he says, you are both married, you are both Libidinous beyond example, and your Husbands are the greatest Cornutors in Christendomâ Elia., L. P. Indeed. Pol. Ay indeed, indeed and indeedâHe says you are a couple of Messalina's, and the Stews cannot satisfie you; he says your thoughts are swell'd with a Carnosity; nay, you have the Green Sickness of the Soul, which runs upon nothing but weighing Stallions, churning Boars, and bellowing Bullsâ L. P. O! I confess, I confessâBut for Heav'n sake, dear Sirâ Let it not take Air, for then we are both undone. Elia. O! Undone, undone Sir, if our Husbands shou'd know it, for they are a couple of the Jealousest, troublesome, impertinent Cuckolds alive. Pol. Alack! AlackâO Jezabel! but I will have my Eunuchs fling her from the Window, and the Dogs shall eat her. L. P. But, pray Sir, ask him how many timesâ Pol. What, how many times you have Cuckolded 'em? Elia. Spare our Modesty, you make the Blood so flush in our Faces. Pol. But by Jove I'll let it out, I'll hold her by the Muzzle, and stick her like a Pigâ L. P. Will you speak to him Sir? Pol. See, he understands you without it, he says your Iniquities are innumerable, your Fornications like the hairs of your head, and your Adulteries like the Sands on the Sea-shore; that you are all Fish downward; that Lot's Wife is fresh to you, and that when you were little Girls of Seven, you were so wanton, your Mothers ty'd your hands behind youâ Elia. All this we confess to be true, but we confess too, if Fate had found out any sort of Tools, but those leaden Rogues our Husbands. L. P. Whose Wits are as dull as their Appetitesâ El. Mine such a Utensil, as is not fit to wedge a Block. L. P. Nor mine the Beetle to drive himâ St. A. Nay then 'tis time to uncase and be reveng'd. L. P. Heark you Strumpetâ El., L. P. Ha, Ha, Ha, are you not fitted finely, âYou must turn Fortune-tellers, must you? Eli. And think we cou'd not know you? L. P. Well Gentlemen, shall homely Beck go down with you at last? Pol. But didst thou know me then indeed? L. P. As if that sweet Voice of yours cou'd be disguis'd in any shape. Pol. Nay, I confess I have a whirl in my Voice, a warble that is particularâ El. And what say you Sir, shall musty Wife come into Grace agen? St. A. She shall, and, here's my hand on't, all Friends Nell, and when I leave thee agen, may I be Cuckold in earnest. Pol. Certain as I live, all this proceeded from his Lady, my dreaming Cuckold Wife cou'd never think on't; well, I am resolv'd this very night, when he Rambles in his sleep, to watch him, slip to his Wife and say nothing. Hey! Come, come, where are these Dancers, a little Diversion and then for Bed. Dance. Tour. to Elia. I have lock'd the Vidam in your Closet, who will be sure to watch your Husbands rising, therefore be not surpriz'dâ [Exit Tournon. St. A. Come, well let's away to bed. El. And what then? St. A. Nay, Gad that I can't tell, for what with Dancing, Singing, Fencing, and my last Dutchess, I am very Drowzy. Pol. And so am I, perhaps our Wives have giv'n us Opium, lest we shou'd disturb 'em in the night. Eli. Don't these Men deserve to be fitted? Cel. They do, and Fortune grant they mayâHear us, O! hear us good Heav'n, for we pray heartily. [Bxeunt as Nemours and Marguerite enter: Nem. Was ever Man so blest with such possession, Thou Ebbing, Flowing, Ravishing, Racking Joy; A Skin so white and soft, the yielding Mould Lets not the Fingers stay upon the dint, But from the beauteous Dimples slips 'em down To pleasures that must be without a name. Yet Hands, and Arms, and Breasts we may remember, And that which I so love, no smelling Art, But sweet by nature, as just peeping Violets, Or op'ning Buds. Marg. Than you do love me? Nem. O! I cou'd dye methinks this very hour, But for the luscious hopes of thousand more, And all like these, yet when I must go out, Let it be thus, with beauty laughing by me, Songs, Lutes and Canopeis, while I Sacrifice To thee the last dear ebbing drop of Love. But show me now that face. Marg. No, you dissemble, you say the same thing to every one you meet; I thought once indeed to have fixt my Heart upon you, but I'm off agen, and am resolv'd you shall never see me. Nem. You dally, come, by all the kindness past. Marg. Swear then. Nem. What? Marg. Never to touch your dear Domestick she, That lives in Shades to all the World but me. Do you guess I know you now? Nem. I do, and swear, but are these equal Terms, that you shall never touch a Man but me? Marg. I willâBut how can you convince me? Oaths with you Libertines of Honour are to little purpose. Nem. But this must satisfie thee, there is more pleasure in thee after Enjoyment, than in her and all Womankind before it; thou hast Inspiration, Extasie, and Transport, all these bewitching Joys that make men madâ Marg. Unmasking] And thou Villany, Treachery, Perjury, all those Monstrous, Diabolical Arts, that seduce Young Virgins from their Innocent homes, to set 'em on the High-way to Hell and Damnation. Nem. Ha! Ha! my Marguerite, is't possible? Marg. Call me not yours, nor think of me agen, I am convinc'd you're Traytors all alike, And from this hour renounce youâ Not but Ill be reveng'd, Yes, I will try the Joys of Life like you, But not with Men of Quality, you Devils of Honour; No, I will satisfie My Pride, Disdain, Rage and Revenge more safely, By all the Powers of Heav'n and Earth I will; I'll change my loving lying Tinsel Lord, For an obedient wholsome drudging Fool. Nem. Why this will make the matter easie to both, Take you your Ramble Madam, and I'll take mine. But is't possible for one of your nice tast To Bed a Fool? Marg. To choose, to choose my Lord A Fool, now by my Will and pride of Heart, There's Freedom, Fancy and Creation in't, He truckles to the Frown, and cries forgive me; Besides the moulding of him without blushing; And what wou'd Woman more, now view the other Your Man of Sense, that vaunts despotick Pow'r, That reels precisely home at break of day, Thunders the House, brains half the Family, Cries, where's my Whore, what will she Stew till Doomsday? When she appears, and kindly goes to help him, Roars out a Shop, a walking-shop of Scents, Flavours of Physick, and the clammy Bath, The slench of Orange-flow'rs, the Devil Pulvilio; These, these, he cries, are the Blest Husband's Joys! Nem. I swear most natural and unaffectedâHa! Haâ Marg. But if he chance to use her civilly, Take heed, there's covert malice in his Smiles, Millions to one the Villain has been Whoreing, And comes to try Experiments on her, Besides a thousand under Plots and Crosses, Prescribing silence still where-e'er he comes, No chat, he cries, of Colours Points or Fashions. Nem. Preach on Divine, Ha, Haâ Marg. Let me not hear you ask my sickly Lady, Whither she found Obstructions at the Waters. Nem. Fye, that's Obsceneâ Marg. Thus Damns the Affectation of our Prattle, And Swears he'll Gag the Clack, or what is worse. Nem. Nay, holdâ Marg. Send for the new found Lockâ Nem. What Madâ Marg. Do Villain, Traytorâ Contrive this Mischief, if thou canst, for me, Send thou the Padlock, but I'll find the Key. [Exit. Nem. Whir goes the Partridge on the purring Wingâ Yet when I see my time I must recall her, For she has admirable things in her, such as if I gain not, the Princess of Cleve may fix me to her, without nauseating the Vice of Constancyâ Ha! Bellamore. Enter Bellamore. What News, my Dear, HaâHast thou found her? Speak. Bell. I have. Nem. Where, how, when and by what means? Bell. After I had enquir'd after the Prince's Health, I ask'd a Woman of his Lady, who told me, She was retir'd into the great Bower in the Garden. Nem. The very place where first I saw and lov'd her, When after I had sav'd the Prince's Life, He brought me late one ev'ning to the view, There Love and Friendship first began; My Love remains and Friendship, as Much as Man can have for his Cuckold. Nay, I know not that Man upon Earth I love so well, or cou'd take so much from, as this hopeful Prince of CleveâDidst thou see her in the Gardenâ Bell. My Lord, I did, where she appear'd like her that gave Acteon Horns, with all her Nimphs about her, busie in tyeing Knots which she took from Baskets of Ribbons that they brought her; and methought she ti'd and unti'd 'em so prettily, as if she had been at Cross Questions, or knew not what she did, her Face, her Neck, and Arms quite bareâ Nem. No more, if I live I'll see her to night, for the Heroick Vein comes upon meâDeath and the Devil, what shall become of the back-stair Lady thenâHeark thee Bellamore, take this Key, dost thou hear Rogue? go to St. Andre's House, through the Garden up the back-stairs, push open the door and be blest. Hell! can't I be in two places at once? Heark thee, give her this, and this, and this, and when thou bitest her with a parting blow, sigh out Nemours. Bell. I'll do'tâ Enter the Prince of Cleve. Nem. Go to Tournon for the rest, she'll instruct thee in the Management: Away. [Exit Bell. Ha! he comes up but slowly, yet he sees me, Perhaps he's Jealous, why then I'm jealous too; Hypocrisie and Softness, with all the Arts of Woman, Tip my Tongue. P. C. I come, my Lord, to ask you if you love me. Nem. Love thee, my Cleve, by Heav'n, e'er yet I saw thee, Thus were my Prayers still offer'd to the Fates, If I must choose a Friend, grant me ye Powers The Man I love may seize my Heart at once; Guide him the perfect temper of your selves, With ev'ry manly Grace and shining Vertue; Add yet the bloom of Beauty to his Youth, That I may make a Mistress of him too. P. C. O Heav'n! Nem. That at first view our Souls may kindle, And like two Tapers kindly mix their Beams; I knelt and pray'd, and wept for such a Blessing, And they return'd me more than I cou'd ask, All that was Good or Great or Just in thee. P. C. You say you love me, I must make the proof, For you have brought it to a doubtâ Nem. In what? P. C. In this, you have not giv'n me all your Heart, You Muse of late, ev'n on my Bridal day, I saw you sit with a too thoughtful brow, You sigh'd and hung your Head upon your Hand: Nay in the midst of Laughterâ You started, blush'd and cry'd 'twas wond'rous well, And yet you knew not whatâSpeak like a Friend, What is the cause my Lord? Nem. Shall I deal plainly with you? I'm not well. P. C. I do believe it, how hap'ned the Distemper? Nem. It is too deep to search, Nor can I tell you. P. C. Then you're no Friend. Shou'd Cleve thus answer to Nemours, I cannot: Say rather that you will not trust a Man You do not love. Nem. By Heav'n I do. P. C. By Heav'n you do? Yet 'tis too deep to search For such a shallow Friend. Nem. Of all Mankind You ought notâ P. C. Nay, the rest. Nem. It is not fit, Be satisfied, I'll bear it to my Grave Whate'er it be. P. C. You are in Love my Lord, And if you do not SwearâBut where's the need? You start, you change, you are another Man, You blush, you're all constraint, you turn away. Nem. Why take it then; 'tis true, I am in Love, In Torture, Racks, in all the Hells of Love, Of hopeless, restless and eternal Love. P. C. Her name my Lord. Nem. Her name my Lord to you? P. C. To me Confusion, Plagues and Death upon me, Why not to me? And wherefore did you say, Of all Mankind I ought notâThere you stopt, But wou'd have saidâTo pry into this businessâ Yet speak to ease the Troubles of my Soul, By all our Friendship, by the Life thou gav'st me, I do conjure thee, thunder in my Ears, 'Tis Chartres that thou lov'st, Chartres my Wife. Nem. Your Wife, my Lord? P. C. My Wife, my Lord, and I must have you own it. Nem. I will not tell you Sir, who 'tis I love, Yet think me not so base, were it your Wife, That all the subtlest Wit of Earth or Hell Shou'd make me vent a Secret of that nature To any Man on Earth, much less to you. P. C. Yet you cou'd basely tell it to the Vidam, And he to all the CourtâBut I waste time, By all the boiling Venom of my Passion, I'll make you own it e'er we partâDispatch, Say thou hast Whor'd my Wife, Damnation on me, Pronounce me Cuckold. Nem. But then I give my self the Lye, Who told you just before, I wou'd not speak, Tho I had done itâWhich I swear I have notâ Beside, I fear you are going Mad. P. C. Draw then and make it up, For if thou dost not own what I demand, What you both know and have complotted on me, Tho neither will confess, I swear agen, That one of us must fall. Nem. Then take my Life. P. C. I will, by Heav'n, if thou refuse me Justice; Draw then, for if thou dost not I will kill thee, And tell my Wife thou basely didst confess Thy Guilt at last, in hopes to save thy Life. Nem That is a blast indeed, that Honour shrinks at, Therefore I draw, but Oh! be witness Heav'n, With such a trembling Hand and bleeding Heart, As if I were to fight against my Father. Therefore I beg thee by the name of Friend, Which once with half this Suit wou'd have dissolv'd thee; I beg thee, gentle Cleve, to hold thy hand. P. C. I'm Deaf as Death, that calls for one or both. [Cleve is disarm'd, Nemours gives him his Sword agen. Nem. Then give it me, I arm thy hand agen, Against my Heart, against this Heart that loves thee; Thrust then, for by the Blood that bears my Life, Thou shalt not know the name of her I love; Not but I swear upon the point of Death, Your Wife's as clear from me, as Heav'n first made her. P. C. No more my Lord, you've giv'n me twice my Life. Nem. Are you not hurt? P. C. Alass, 'tis not so well, I have no Wound but that which Honour makes, And yet there's something cold upon my Heart, I hope 'tis Death, and I shall shortly pay you, With Chartres love, for you deserve her better. Nem. No Sir, you shall not, you shall live my Lord, And long enjoy your beauteous vertuous Bride; You shall, Dear Prince, why are you then so cold? P. C. I cannot speakâ But thus, and thus, there's something rises here. Nem. I'll wait you home, nay, shake these drops away, And hang upon my armâ P. C. I will do any thing, So you will promise never to upbraid me. Nem. I swear I will not. P. C. But will you love me too As formerly? Nem. I swear far more than ever. P. C. Thou know'st my Nature soft, yet Oh such Love! Such Love as mine, and injur'd as I thought, Wou'd spleen the Gaul-less Turtle, wou'd it not? Nem. It wou'd by Heav'nâYou make a Woman of me. [Weeping. P. C. Why, any thing thou sayst to humour me, Yet it is kind, and I must love these Tears, I hope my Heart will break, and then we're ev'n; Yet if this cruel Love thy Cleve shou'd kill, Remember after Death thou lov'st me still. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Tournon with the Vidam. Tour. So let that corner be your Post, and as soon as ever you see St. Andre come stalking in his Dream, slip to his Lady, and when you have agreed upon the Writings, I'll be ready to bring you off with a Witnessâ Vid. Thou Dear obligingâ Tour. No more o'that; away, mark but how easily those that are gifted with Discretion bring things about; in the name of Goodness let Men and Women have their Risks, but still be careful of the Mainâ Here's a hot-headed Lord goes mad for a prating Girl, Treats her, Presents her, Flames for her, Dies for her, till the Fool complies for pure Love, and when the bus'ness fails, is forc'd to live at last by the love of his Footmen; but she that makes a firm Bargain, is commonly thought a great Soul, for my Lord having consider'd on't, thinks her a Person of depth, and so resolves to have it out of herâBut why do I talk so my self, when there's something to do, certainly I shou'd have made a rare Speaker in a Parliament of Women, or a notable Head to a Female Jury, when his Lordship gravely puts the question, whither it be Satis or Non Satis or Nunquam Satis, and we bring it in Ignoramusâ Ha! but who comes here? I must attend for Bellamore. Enter Poltrot, Celia over-hearing. Pol. My Wife and I went to Bed together, and I'll warrant full she was of Expectation, so white and clean, and much inclin'd to laugh, and lay at her full length, as who wou'd say come eat me. Cel. Said she so sweet Sir? Pol. Not a bit by the Lord, not I, not Iâ Cel. Alas! nice Gentleman. Pol. A Farmer wou'd say this was barbarously done, because he loves BeefâBut I have Plover in reserveâHa! St. Andre, heark, I hear him bustle, O Lord! how my heart goes pit a pat! nay, I dreamt last night I was Geltâ Enter St. Andre in his sleep. The Vidam goes inâ 'Tis he, 'tis he, by the twilight I see himâ Ay, now the politick head goes, it shall be branch'd by and byâWhat was that stop for, there's neither Gate nor Stile in your way; now by that sudden stretch, he seems as if he wou'd take a jump, or practice on the High rope; O your humble Servant Sir, I'll but do a little bus'ness for you, and be with you agen. Nay, look you Sir, I have as many Bobs as Democritus when he cry'd Poor lackâThere's more Pride in a Puritans Band, short Hair, and Cap pinch'd, than under a Kings Crown. Poor Jack, Citizens, Citizens, look to your Wives, the Courtiers come, look to 'em, they'll do 'em, look to 'em, they'll do 'em, Poor Jackâ St. A. Ha! Ha! You'll tickle me to deathâNay, prithee Penâ Your Mistress will hear usâThou art the wantonest Rogueâ Enter Tournon with Bellamore. Tour. Madam. Cel. Here's. Tour. Here's a Thief I took in your Chamberâ Bell. Ah Madam! retire for a moment, and I'll make you the whole Confession. Cel. Confess and you know what follows, however I am resolv'd to hear what you can say for your self. [Exeunt. St. A. Nay Pish, nay Fie sweet heartâ But I'll kiss you if I can; I did not take you for to be Such a kind of a Man. [Re-enter Poltrot. But I'll go call my Mother as loud as I can cry, Why Mother, Mother, Mother, out upon you, Fye. Pol. O Lord! O Lord! I had like to have trod upon a Serpent that wou'd have bit me to death. I went to take up the Cloths as gently as I cou'd for my Life, when a great huge hoarse Voice flew in my face, with Damme you Son of a Whore, I'll cut your Throat; you may guess I withdrew, for o'my Conscience the Fright had almost made me unclean; but I'll to my own Spouse, and if the Lord be pleas'd to bring me off safe this bout, I'll never, never go a Cuckold-making agen while my eyes are open. [Exit. St. A. Heark, my Wife's coming up StairsâHelp up with my Breeches; so, so, smooth the BedâWhat damn'd Luck's thisâ So, fall a rubbing the Room agenâHeark you Wife, Celia has been upon the hunt for you all this day, she's below in the Garden, go, go, we'll kiss when you come backâNow Sirrah, now you Rogue, she's gone, come, come, lose not your opportunity, I'll keep on my Breeches for fearâAy? No, no, not upon the Bed, Pish, against the back of this ChairâWon't itâHow can you tellâTryâI'll buy thee a new Gown, and a Fan, and a lac'd Petticoat, and pay thee double Wages; O! thou dear pretty soft sweet wriggling Rogue, what wou'dst thou dodge me, Gad but I'll have thee, Gad but I'll catch thee; Ay, and have at thee agen and agen. [Exit. Re-enter Poltrot. Pol. Was ever Man of Honour thus unfortunately met with? I went into my Chamber and trod as softly as a half-starv'd Mouse, for fear of waking my Cat, when coming close to my Bed-side, methought it rock'd to and fro like a great Cradle, and the Cloaths heav'd as if some Beast lay blowing thereâBut the Beast was by the Bed-side it seemsâYes, I am, and who can help it, as very a Cornuto as e'er was graftedâ I heard my beloved Wife tooâThe Plagues of Egypt on herâSpeak so lovingly and angrily togetherâNay, Prithee my DearâNay, now you are tiresomeâI shall be asham'd to look you in the face agen! Why, how will she look upon me then? O LordâO LordâWhat shall I do? shall I stand thus like a Cuckoldly Son of a Whore, with my Horns in my Pocket and not be reveng'dâ âEeter St. Andreâ But here comes as very a Cuckold as my self, I am resolv'd to wake him, and we'll fall upon 'em togetherâAllo, St. Andre, St. Andre. St. A. Tiâti 'tis imâimâimâpossible I-I-I shou'd be the Man, Fo-Fo-For I cannot speak a plain word. Pol. You're a Cuckold, a Cuckold, a Cuckold. St. A. Why lo-lo-look you, I said it co-co cou'd not be me, for Sir, I all the World knows I am no Cu-Cu-Cu-ckold. Pol. Wake, wake, I say, or I'll shake the bones out of your Body, your Horns are a growing, your Bed is a going, your Heifer's a Plowing. St. A. Why, let her Plo-Plo-Plow on, if the Se-Se-Seed be well Sown, we shall have a good Cro-Cropâ Pol. Worse and worse, why then I will roar out directly and raise the NeighboursâHelp! Ho, Help! Murder! Murder! Fire! Fire! Fire! Cuckoldom! Cuckoldom! Thieves! Murder! Rapes! Cuckoldom! Enter the Vidam and Bellamore. The Vidam comes up to Poltrot, shoots off a Pistol, St. Andre and Poltrot fall down togetherâTournon enters with the LadiesâTournon leads off the Vidam and Bellamore. Cel. Thieves! Thieves! Ho! Jaques! PedroâThomaâ Elia. Thieves! ThievesâWake! wake! my Lord. St. A. Waking] Why, what a Devil's the matter? where am I? Elia. O! you'll never leave this ill habit of walking in your sleepâ 'Tis a mercy we had not all been Murder'dâYou went down in your Shirt Sir, open'd the door, and let in Rogues that had like to have cut all our ThroatsâBut for the future I am resolv'd to tye you to me with the Bed cord, rather than endure thisâ St. A. Where's Poltrot? Cel. Murder'd Sir, here! here! here! one of the Villains discharg'd a Pistol just in his Bellyâ St. A. Shot in the Guts! Lord bless us! here Thom. a light! light! light! shot in the Guts say youâ Pol. Oh! OhâLower, lower, lowerâFeel, feel, search me, lower, lowerâ St. A. Cold hereaboutsâLet's bear him to his Bed, and send for a Surgeonâ Pol. Softly! softly! softlyâCome not near me Crocodil; Oh! Ohâ St. A. Unhappy Chance, no where but just in the Guts? Pol. Yes, yes, yes, in the Head too, in the Head Man, in the Head: Nay, and let me tell you, you had best search your own, but bear me off or I shall Swoon, I feel something trickle, trickle in my Breeches; Oh! Oh! Oh! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Enter Nemours, Pedro list'ning. Nem. Alass! Poor Prince, I protest the Violence of his Passion has cast him in a Fever, he dies of itâAnd how then? shall I Marry the Princess of Cleve, or stick to Marguerite as we are? for 'tis most certain she has rare things in her, which I found by my last Experiment, and I love her more than ever, almost to Jealousie; besides Tournon tells me, the Dauphin begins to buz about her agen, and who knows but in this heat of hers, as she says, she will hang her self out to sale, but he may nick the time and buy herâI like not thatâ No, I'll throw boldly, clear the Table if I can, if not, 'tis but at last forswearing Play, shake off my new acquaintance, and be easie with my reserveâHeark, I am just upon the Bower Musickâ Pedro. I have hitherto obey'd my Master's order, but I'm resolv'd to dog him till he's lodg'dâ Ne. Now do I know the Precise will call me damn'd Rogue for wronging my Friend, especially such a soft sweet natur'd Friend as this gentle PrinceâVerily I say they lye in their Throats, were the gravest of 'em in my condition, and thought it shou'd never be known, they wou'd rouze up the Spirit, cast the dapper Cloak, leave off their humming and haing, and fall too like a Man of Honour. [Exit. Pedro I'll face him till he enters the Bower, and then call my Lord. [Ex. Scene the Bower, Lights, Song. The Princess of Cleve, Irene. SONG. Lovely Selina, Innocent and Free From all the dangerous Arts of Love, Thus in a Melancholy Grove Enjoy'd the sweetness of her Privacy, Till th'envious Gods designing to undo her, Dispatcht the Swain, not unlike them, to wo her: It was not long e'er the design did take, A gentle Youth born to perswade, Deceiv'd the too too easie Maid; Her Scrip and Garlands soon she did forsake. And rashly told the Secrets of her Heart, Which the fond Man would ever more impart. False Florimel, Joy of my Heart, said she, 'Tis hard to Love and Love in vain, To Love and not be Lov'd again, And why shou'd Love and Prudence disagree? Pity ye Powers that sit at ease above: If e'er you knew what 'tis to be in Love. Princess C. Alas! Irene, I do believe Nemours The Man thou represents him; yet, Oh! Heav'n, And Oh my Heart! in spite of my resolves, Spite of those matchless Virtues of my Husband, I love the Man my reason bids me hate: Yet grant me some few hours ye Saints to live, That I may try what Innocence so arm'd As mine, with vows can do in such a cause! The War's begun, the War of Love and Vertue, And I am fixt to conquer or to dye. Iren. Your Fate is hard, and since you honour'd me With the important Secret of your Life, I've labour'd for the Remedy of Love. Princess C. I must to Death own thee my better Angel, Thou know'st the struglings of my wounded Soul, Hast seen me strive against this lawless Passion, Till I have lain like Slaves upon the Rack, My Veins half burst, my weary Eye-balls fixt, My Brows all cover'd with big drops of Sweat, Which strangling Grief wrung from my tortur'd Brain. Ir. Alass I weep to see you thus agen. Princess C. Thou hast heard me curse the hour, when first I saw The fatal charming Face of lov'd Nemours, Hast heard the Death-bed Counsel of my Mother. Yet what can this avail, spite of my Soul The Nightly Warnings from her dreadful Shroud? I love Nemours, I languish for Nemours, And when I think to banish him my Breast, My Heart rebels, I feel a gorgeing pain That choaks me up, tremblings from Head to Foot; A shog of Blood and Spirits, Mad-mens Fears, Convulsions, gnawing Griefs and angry Tears. Enter Nemours. Ha! but beholdâMy Lordâ Nem. O! Pardon me, Spare me a minute's space and I am gone. Princes. C. Is this a time Sir? Nem. O! I must speak or dye. Princess C. Dye then, e'er thus presume to violate The Honour of your Friend, your own and mineâ Nem. Yet hear me, and I swear by all things Sacred, Never to see you more. Princess C. Speak thenâAnd keep your word. P. C. Horrour and Death! Nem. Did you but know what 'tis to love like me, Without a dawn of Bliss to dream all day, To pass the night in broken sleeps away, Toss'd in the restless tides of Hopes and Fears, With Eyes for ever running o'er with Tears; To leave my Couch, and fly to beds of Flow'rs, T'invoke the Stars, to curse the dragging hours, To talk like Mad-men to the Groves and Bow'rs. Cou'd you know this, yet blame my tortur'd Love, If thus it throws my Body at your Feet: Oh! fly not hence; Vouchsafe but just to view me in despair, I ask not Love, but Pity from the Fair. Princess C. O Heavens! inspire my Heart. Nem. The Heavenly Powers Accept the poorest Sacrifice we bring, A Slave to them's as welcome as a King. Behold a Slave that Glories in your Chains, Ah! with some shew of Mercy view my Pains; Your piercing Eyes have made their splendid way, Where Lightning cou'd not passâ Even through my Soul their pointed Lustre goes, And Sacred Smart upon my Spirit throws; Yet I your Wounds with as much Zeal desire, As Sinners that wou'd pass to Bliss through Fire. Yes, Madam, I must love you to my Death, I'll sigh your name with my last gasp of Breath. Princess C. No more, I have heard you Sir, as you desir'd, Enter the Prince of Cleve. Reply not, but withdraw, if possible; Fix to your word, and let us trust our Fates, Be gon I charge you, speak not, but retire. [Exit. Nem. P. C. Excellent Woman, and Oh! matchless Friend, Love, Friendship, Honour, Poison, Daggers, Death. [Falls. Princess C. O Heaven! Irene, help! help the Prince my Lord. My Dearest Cleve, wake from this Dream of Death, And hear me speakâ P. C. Curse on my Disposition, That thus permits me bear the Wounds of Honour! And Oh! thou foolish, gentle, love-sick Heart, Why didst thou let my hand from stabbing both? Princess C. Behold, 'tis yet my Lord within your Power To give me Deathâ P. C. I do entreat thee leave me, I'm bound for Death my self, and I wou'd make My passage easie, if you wou'd permit me: All that I ask thee for the Heart I gave thee; And for the Life I love in thy behalf, Is, that thou'dst leave me to my self a while, And this poor honest Friendâ Princess C. I wou'd obey you, But cannot stirâI know, I know my Lord, You think that I design'd to meet Nemours This night, but by the Powers above I Swear. P. C. O! do not Swear, for Chartres credit me, There is a Power that can and will revenge; Therefore dear Soul, for I must love thee still, If thou wilt speak, confess, repent thy fault, And thou, perhaps, may'st find a door of Mercy: For me, by all my hopes of Heav'n, I swear I freely now forgive theeâOh! my Heartâ Pedro, thy arm, let me to bedâ Princess C. And do you then refuse My help? P. C. In Honour Chartres, after such a Fall, I ought not to permit that thou shou'dst touch meâ Princess C. But Sir, I will, your arm? I'll hold you all Thus in the closest strictest dearest Clasps; Nor shall you dye believing my Dishonor, I swear I knew not of Nemours his coming, Nor had I spoke those words which yet were guiltless, Had he not vow'd never to see me more: By our first Meeting, by our Nuptial Joys, By my dead Mother's Ghost, by your own Spirit; Which Oh! I fear is taking leave for ever, I swear that this is trueâ P. C. I do believe thee; Thou hast such Power, such Charms in those dear Lips, As might perswade me that I am not dying. Off Pedro, by my most untimely Fate I swearâI'm reconcil'd; and heark thee Cleve, If thou dost Marry, Ha! I cannot speak, Away to Bed, yet love my Memoryâ Princess C. To Bed, and must we part then? P. C. O! we mustâ Were I to live I shou'd not see thee moreâ But since I am dying, by this Kiss I beg thee, Nay, I command thee part, be gone and leave me. Princess C. I go, and leave this Farewel Prayer behind me. For me, if all I've said be not most true, True as thou think'st me False, all Curses on me! The Whips of Conscience, and the Stings of Pleasure, Soars and Distempers, Disappointments plague me; May all my Life be one continu'd Torment, And that more Racking than a Woman's Labour; In meeting Death may my least Trouble be As great as now my parting is with thee.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Poltrot, Bellamore. Bell. Come, come, take her into Grace agen, 'twas but a slip. Pol. Take her into Grace agen?âWhy sure you wou'd have her bring me to that pass she did in England, when my Lord Hairbrain us'd to keep me in awe, stand biting my Lips, twisting my Hat, playing with my Thumbs while they were at it, and I durst not look behind me. Bell. Meer Jealousie; you say your self you saw nothing. Pol. No Sir, I thank you, I had more care of my Throat; neither is this the first Fault; for once upon a time, a little while after we were Married, at Londonâa Pox o'that Cuckolding Trojan Race; she was talking to me one day out of her Window more pleasantly than ordinaryâ And acted with her Head and Body wond'rous prettilyâButting at me like a little Goat, while I butted at her agen. I being glad to find her in so good humour, what did I Sir, but stole away, and came softly up the back-stairs, thinking to cry BoâBut Oh! LordâHow was I Thunder-struck, to find my Lord Hairbrain there all in a Sweatâ Kissing and Smacking, Puffing and Blowing so hard, you wou'd have sworn they had been at Hot-cocklesâ Bell. A little Familiar perhaps, things of Customâ Pol. Ay Sir, Kiss my Wife and welcome, but for that Zeal in her shogging and ButtingâNoli me tangere I cryâI am sure it ran so in my Imagination, I have been Horn-mad ever sinceâTherefore spare your pains, for I am resolute. Enter Celia. Bell. See where she comes my LordâBut you are resolv'd you sayâHowever, let me advise you, have a care of making her desperate. [Exit. Pol. DesperateâDamn her, Polluter of my SheetsâDamn her. Seek, Celia, not to shun me, for where'er you fly, I'll followâhang upon thy knees and dye. [Cel.] Poltrot, beholdâAh! canst thou see me kneel, And yet no Bowels of Compassion feel? Why dost thou bluster by me like a Storm, And ruffle into Frowns that Godlike Form? Why dost thou turn away those Eyes of thine, In which Love's Glory and his Conquests shine? Pol. What is this thing call'd Woman? she is worse Than all Ingredients ram'd into a Curse. Were she a Witch, a Bawd, a Noseless Whore, I cou'd forgive her, so she were no more: But she's far worse, and will in time Forestall The Devil, and be the Damning of us all. Cel. Yet Honour bids you sink with her you call So foul, whose Frailties you too sharply nam'd; Like Adam you shou'd choose with her to fall, And in meer Generosity be Damn'd. Pol. No, by thy self, and all alone be curst, And by the Winds thy Venom dust be hurl'd; For thou'rt a Serpent equal to the first, And hast the will to Damn another World. Cel. But am I not thy Wife? Let that attoneâ Pol. My Dear Damn'd Wife, I do confess thou art Flesh of my Flesh, and Bone too of my Bone, Wou'd mine had all been broke when first thou wert. Cel. Why then I'll cringe no longer, heark you Sir, leave off your Swelling and Frowning, and awkward ambling, and tell me in fine, whether you'll be reconcil'd or no, for I am resolv'd to stoop no longer to an ungrateful Person. Pol. To your Husband, to your Head, to your Lord and Master, you will not Goodey Bathsheba, but you cou'd stoop your Swines Flesh last night you cou'd, to your Rank Bravado, that wou'd have struck his Tusks in my Guts; he had you with a Beck, a Snort, nay, o'my Conscience thou wou'dst not give him time to speak, but hunch'd him on the side like a full Acorn'd Boar, cry'd Oh! and mountedâ Cel. Are you resolv'd then, never to take me into Grace agen for one Slip? Pol. No, I'm the Son of a Carted Bawd if I do; a Slip do you call it? what, when I heard the Bed crack with the Violence of my Cuckoldom! No, I will ascend the Judge of my own Cause, proceed to Condemnation, and banish thee for ever the Confines of our Benevolenceâ Cel. What here, before the Vidam here? Pol. Yes, Impudence, before the Vidam and the Duke Nemours; nay, to thy eternal Confusion, I will post thee in the Market-place; but first I'll find out St. Andre, and tell him the whole matter, that he may know too, what a Ram his blessed Ewe has made him, and thenâ Cel. And then I'll have your Throat cut. Pol. Ha! Tygress, cut my Throat! why thou Shee Bear! thou Dam of Lyons Whelps, thou Cormorant of Cormorants, why what wilt thou devour me Horns and all? Cel. He that miss'd your Guts in the dark, shall take better aim at your Gullet by day-light; nay, to thy Terror of Heart be it known, thou Monster of ill nature, if I wou'd have consented last night to have run his Fortune, which is no small one, he wou'd have murder'd thee in thy Bed, for I heard him speak these very words, Let him lye, In Mortuisâ&amp; in limbo PatrumâWhere I must have pray'd for that unthankful Soul, or thou wou'dst have been Damn'd to all Eternity, dying suddenly and without Repentanceâ Pol. O Lord! O Lord! In Mortuis, &amp; in limbo Patrum; what, to be toss'd on burning Pitchforks for my Sins, why, what a Bloody-minded Son of Belial is this? Cel. In fine, since you will have the truth, he has long had a design upon both our Bodies, to Ravish mine, and rip open yours. Pol. Why then he's a Cannibal; Lord! Lord! Lord! Lord! why what pleasure can it be to any Man to rip me open? to Ravish thee indeed, there's some Sense in thatâBut there's none in ripping me open; why this is such a brutish Crueltyâ Cel. Rogue, and so I told himâTherefore when he found that nothing cou'd make me consent to your Murder, he Swore, and caught me by the hair, if I stir'd, or made the least noise, he wou'd Murder us all, set the House o'Fire, and so leave us to our selvesâ Pol. And so thou wert forc'd to consent; why then by this Kiss, I Swear from my Soul, which might have been Damn'd as thou sayst, but for thee, I forgive theeâAnd what was he that Cuckolded St. Andre, such another Mephostophilus as this too? Cel. O! my Dear, there are not such a pair of Fiends upon Earth agenâWhy, they look upon't as a Favour to our Sex if they Ravish a Woman, for you must know they were formerly Heads of the Bandittiâ Pol. Well, and I must praise thy Discretion in Sacrificing thy Body, for o'my Conscience, if they had seen this Smock-face of mine, I had gone to pot too before my Execution. Cel. They sent their Pages this Morning to know whether it was our pleasure to have your Throats cut: But we answered 'em all was well, and desir'd 'em as ever they hop'd to see us agen, to stir no further in the matter. Pol. Mum, Mum, dear sweet Soul, secure my Life and thou shalt command me for the future with as full a swing as thou canst desire, only like those that use that exercise, let it be too and fro, sometimes at home and sometimes abroad, and we'll be as merry as the day is long. Cel. Be thou but true to me, and like the Indian Wives, I'll not out-live theeâ Pol. And I'll Swear now, that was kindly said, as I hope for mercy, but it makes me weep, what burn for meâAnd shall I not return, I will, I will, I will return when thou dost burn; Enter St. Andre, Elianor. Nay, when thy Body in the Fire appears, My Ghost shall rise and quench it with his Tears. St. A. All Flesh is Grass, that's certain, we're all Mortal, the Court's in Mourning for the Prince of Cleve, the Vidam of Chartres is extreamly griev'dâHeark you Poltrot, sure as I am alive he dy'd of Jealousie. Well Nelle, for this last care of thine, I Swear to be constant to thy Sheets, and as thou sayst, I think it will not be amiss to tye me to thee now and then for fear of the worstâHa! Poltrotâ Pol. Ha! Bully, I heard your kind Expressions to your Nelle, and I'll Swear I'll vie thee with who shall love most, for I'll Swear these daily Examples make my hair stand an endâCut my Throat, and rip me open, he shall Cuckold me all over first, like the Man in the Almanack, nay, he shall Ravish her while I hold the door to my own deflow'ring. SCENE II. Tournon, Nemours. Nem. Resolv'd never to see me more, and give up her Honour to the Dauphin, that puling sniveling Prince, that looks as if he suck'd still, or were always in a Milk Diet for the Sins of his Florentine Mother. Tour. Bless me! you are jealous. Nem. I confess itâThe last time I had her in Disguise, she made such Discoveries as I shall never forget: Lose her I must not, no, I'll lose a Limb first, therefore go tell her, tell her the Prince of Cleve's Death has wrought my Conversion, I grow weary of my wild Courses, repent of my Sins, am resolv'd to leave off Whoreing and marry his Wifeâ Tour. So the Town talks indeed. Nem. The Town is as it always was and will be, a Talk, a Hum, a Buz, and a great LyeâDo as I bid thee, and tell her, just as you left me, I was going to make my Court to the Princess upon her Husband's Tomb, which is true too, I mean a Visit by the way of Consolation, not but I knew it the only opportunity to catch a Woman in the undress of her Soul; nay, I wou'd choose such a time for my life, and 'tis like the rest of those starts, and one of the Secrets of their NatureâWhy they melt, nay, in Plagues, Fire, Famine, War, or any great Calamityâ Mark itâLet a man stand but right before 'em, and like hunted Hares they run into his lap. Tour. But who's the Instrument to bring you to her? Nem. Her Uncle the Vidam, she lies at his House immur'd in a dark room, with her Husband's Image in her view, and so resolves, he says, for Death. However I'll sound her in the ebb of her Soul, if my Boat run aground 'tis but calling for Marguerite, and she'll weep a Tide that shall set me afloat agenâAs thus, I'll lay the Dauphin in her dish, nose her in the Tiptoe of her Pride, Railing, Lying, Laming, Hanging, Drowning, Dying, and she comes about agen. [Exit. Tour. Go thy ways Petronius, nay, if he were dying too, with his Veins cut, he wou'd call for Wine, Fiddles and Whores, and laugh himself into the other World. Enter La March. Where's Marguerite? La M. She follows like a Wind, with swollen Cheeks, ruffled Hair, and glareing Eyes, the Princess of Cleve has found her Fury, nor will she yet believe it. SCENE III. The Princess of Cleve, Irene in Mourning, Song, as the Princess kneels at the State. [I.] Weep all ye Nymphs, your Floods unbind, For Strephon's now no more; Your Tresses spread before the Wind, And leave the hated Shore: See, see, upon the craggy Rocks, Each Goddess stripp'd appears; They beat their Breasts, and rend their Locks, And swell the Sea with Tears. II. The God of Love that fatal hour, When this poor Youth was born, Had sworn by Styx to show his Power, He'd kill a Man e'er Morn': For Strephon's Breast he arm'd his Dart, And watch'd him as he came; He cry'd, and shot him through the Heart, Thy Blood shall quench my Flame. III. On Stella's Lap he laid his Head, And looking in her Eyes, He cry'd, Remember when I'm dead, That I deserve the Prize: Then down his Tears like Rivers ran, He sigh'd, You Love, 'tis true; You love perhaps a better Man, But Ah! he loves not you. CHORUS. Why should all things bow to Love, Men below, and Gods above? Why should all things bow to Love? Death and Fate more awful move, Death below, and Fate above, Death below, and Fate above. Mortals, Mortals, try your skill, Seeking Good, or shunning Ill, Fate will be the burden still, Will be the burden still, Fate will be the burden still, Fate will be the burden still. Princess C. Dead thou dear LordâYet from thy Throne of Bliss, If any thing on Earth be worth thy view, Look down and hear me, hear my Sighs and Vows, Till Death has made me cold, and Wax like thee: Water shall be my Drink and Herbs my Food, The Marble of my Chappel be my Bed; The Altars Steps my Pillows, while all night Stretch'd out, I groaning lye, upon the Floor, Beat my swoll'n Breasts, and thy dear loss deplore. Iren. Ah! Madam, what a Life have you propos'd? Princess C. Too little all for an Offence like mine; Yet Death will shortly purge my dross away, For Oh! Irene, where's the Joy I find it here, Yes, I shall dye without those violent means That might have hazarded my SoulâO Heavenâ O thou that seest my Heart, and know'st my Terrors, Wilt thou forgive those Crimes I cou'd not help, And wou'd not hide? Iren. Doubt not but your Account Shall stand as fair in his Eternal Book, As any Saints aboveâ Princess C. Take, take me then From this bad World, quench these Rebellious thoughts; For Oh! I have a pang, a longing wish To see the Luckless Face of lov'd Nemours, To gaze a while, and take one last Farewel, Like one that is too loose a Limbâ'Tis goneâ It was corrupt, a Gangreen to my Honour, Yet I methinks wou'd view the bleeding part, Shudder a littleâWeepâand grudge at parting. But by the Soul of my triumphant Saint, I swear this longing is without a guilt, Nor shall it ever be by my appointment. Enter Nemours. Iren. But if he shou'd attempt this cruel visit, How wou'd your Heart receive him? Princess C. With such Temper, So clear and calm in height of my Misfortune, As thou thy self perhaps wou'dst wonder at. Iren. Ha! but he's hereâ Princess C. Is't possible my Lord? Has then my Uncle thus betray'd my Honour? Nem. Start not, nor wonder Madam, but forgive The Vidam who has thus entrap'd your Virtue, To end a ling'ring WretchâThat dies for Loveâ Princess C. For Love, my Lord, is this a time for Love, In Tears and Blacks, the Livery of Death? But what's your hope, if I shou'd stay to hear you? Ah! What can you expect from rigorous Vertue, From Chastity as cold as Cleve himself? You that are made, my Lord, for other Pleasuresâ Nem. Is this then the reward of all my Passion? As if there cou'd be any Happiness For this disconsolate despairing Wretch, But in your Love alone? Princess C. You're pleas'd my Lord That I shou'd entertain you, and I will, Before this dear Remembrancer of Cleve; We'll talk of murder'd LoveâAnd you shall hear From this abandon'd part of him that was, How much you have been lov'd. Nem. Ha! Madamâ Princess C. Yes, Sighing I speak it Sir, you have inspir'd me With something which I never felt before, That pleas'd and pain'd the quicknings of first Love; Nor fear'd him then, when with his Infant Beams, He dawn'd upon my chill and senseless Blood. But Oh! when he had reach'd his fierce Meridian, How different was his form! that Angel Face, With his short Rayes, shot to a glaring God. I grew inflam'd, burnt inward, and the Breath Of the grown Tyrant, parch'd my Heart to Ashes. Nor need I blush to make you this Confession, Because, my Lord, 'tis done without a Crime. Nem. Because for this most blest discovery, I am resolv'd to kneel an Age before you. Princess C. Rise, I conjure you, rise, I've told you nothing But what you knew, my Lord, too well before: Not but I always vow'd to keep those Rules My Duty shou'd prescribe. Nem. Strike me not dead With Duty's name, by Heav'n I Swear you're free As Air, as Waters, Winds or open Wilds, There is no Form of Obligation now; Nay, let me say, for Duty: O forgive me, 'Tis utmost Duty now to keep that Love You have confess'd for me. Princess C. 'Tis Duty's Charge, The voice of Honour and the cry of Love, That I shou'd fly from Paris as a Pest, That I shou'd wear these Rags of Life away In Sunless Caves, in Dungeons of Despair, Where I shou'd never think of Man agen. But more particularly that of you, For Reasons yet unknown. Nem. Unknown they are, And wou'd to Heav'n they might be ever so, Since 'tis impossible they shou'd be just; Nay, Madam, let me say the Ghost of Cleveâ Princess C. Ah! Sir, how dare you mention that dear name, That drains my Eyes, and cries to Heav'n for Blood. Name it no more without the Consequence, For 'tis but too too true, you were the Cause Of Cleve's untimely Death, I Swear I think No less than if you had stabb'd him through the Heart. Nem. O! Cruel Princess, but why shou'd I answer, When thus you raise the shadow of a reason To ruin me for ever? Is it a fault To Love? Then blame not me; No, Madam, no, But blame your self, who told it to your Husband; But Oh! you wou'd not argue thus against me If ever you had lov'dâ You have deceiv'd your self and flatter'd me; Why am I thrown else from the Glorious Height, Snatch'd in a moment from my blissful State, And hurl'd like Lightning by the hand of Fate? Princess C. Be satisfi'd, my Lord, you are not flatter'd, I have such Love for you, that Duties bar, Wou'd prove too weak to hinder our Engagement. But there is more. Nem. More Fancy, more Chimera! But let it come, I'll stand the stalking Nothing, And when the bladder'd Air wou'd turn the Ballance, I'll cast in Love substantial, pondrous Love, Eternal Love, and hurl him to the Beam. But speak, and if a Hell of Separation Must part my Soul and Body, do not Rack me, But let the Poyson steal into my Veins, And Damn me mildly, Madam, as you can. Princess C. Hear then, my bosom thoughtâ'Tis the last time I e'er shall see you, and 'tis a poor reward For such a Love, yet, Sir, 'tis all I have, And you must ask no more. Nem. Be Witness, Heav'n, Of my Obedience, I will ask her nothing. Princess C. Know then, my Lord, you're free, and I am so Free for the eternal Bond of Marriageâ My Heart too is inclin'd by Love like yours, Nor can I fear the censuring World shou'd blame us. But now, my Lord, What Power on Earth can give Security that Bond shall prove Eternal? Nem. Ha! Madam. Princess C. Silence, silence I command you; No, no, Nemours. I know the World too well, You have a Sense too nice for long Enjoyment, Cleve was the Man that only cou'd love long: Nor can I think his passion wou'd have lasted, But that he found I cou'd have none for him. 'Tis Obstacle, Ascent, and Lets and Bars, That whet the Appetite of Love and Glory; These are the fuel for that fiery Passion, But when the flashy stubble we remove, The God goes out and there's an end of Love. Nem. Ah Madam! I'm not able to contain, But must perforce break your commands to answer, Once to be yours, is to be for ever yours, Yours only, without thought of other Woman. Princess C. Why this sounds well and natural till you're cloid, But Oh! when one satiety has pall'd you, You sicken at each view, and ev'ry glance Betrays your guilty Soul, and says you loath her. I know it, Sir, you have the well-bred cast Of Gallantry and Parts to gain success; And do but think when various Forms have charm'd you, How I shou'd bear the cross returns of Love? Nem. Ah Madam! now I find you're prejudic'd To blast my hopes. Princess C. 'Tis Reason, all calm Reason; Nature affirms no violent thing can last, I know't, I see't, ev'ry new Face that came Wou'd charm you from meâHa! and cou'd I Love To see that Fatal day, and see you scorn me, To hear the Ghost of Cleve each hour upbraid me; No, 'tis impossible, with all my Passion, Not to submit to these Almighty Reasons; For this I brave your noblest Qualities, I'll keep your Form at distance, curb my Soul, Despair of Smiles and Tears, and Prayers and Oaths, And all the Blandishments of Perjur'd Love: I will, I must, I shall, nay, now I can, Defie to Death the lovely Traytor Man. Nem. No. Madam, think not you shall carry't thus, 'Tis not allowable, 'tis past example, 'Tis most unnatural, unjust and monstrous; And were the rest of Women thus resolv'd, You wou'd destroy the purpose of Creation. What, when I have the happiness to please, When Heav'n and Earth combine to make us happy, Will you defeat the aim of Destiny, By most unparallel'd extreams of Vertue, Which therefore take away its very Being? Princess C. Away, I must not answer, but conjure you Never to seek occasion more to see me; Farewelâ'Tis past. Nem. I cannot let you go; I'll follow on my Knees, and hold your Robe, Till you have promis'd me that I shall see you, To shew you how each day by slow degrees I dye away: This you shall grant by Heav'n, Or you shall see my Blood let out before you. Princess C. Alas! Nemours, O Heav'n! why must it be, That I shou'd charge you with the death of Cleve? Alass! why met we not e'er I engag'd To my dead Lord? And why did Fate divide us? Nem. Fate does not, Noâ 'Tis you that cross both Fortune, Heav'n and Fate; 'Tis you obstruct my Bliss, 'tis you impose Such Laws as neither Sense nor Vertue warrant. Princess C. 'Tis true, my Lord, I offer much to duty, Which but subsists in thought, therefore have patience, Expect what time, with such a love as mine, May work in your behalf; my Husband's death So bleeding, fresh I see him in the Pangs; Nay, look, methinks I see his Image rise. And point an everlasting Separation; Yet Oh! it shall not be without a Tear. Nem. O! stay. Princess C. Let go, believe no other Man Cou'd thus have wrought me, but your self, to Loveâ Nem. Stay then. Princess C. I dare notâThink I love you stillâ Nem. I doâBut stay and speak it o'er agenâ Princess C. Believe that I shall love you to my death. Nem. I will. But live and love me. Princess C. Off, I charge you. Believe this parting wounds me like the Fate Of Cleve or worse: Believe, but Oh! farewelâ Nem. Believe, but what? That last thought I implore. Princess C. Believe that you shall never see me more. [Exit. Enter the Vidam. Vid. Well, and how goes the Game? What, on the Knee, a gather'd Brow, and a large dew upon it? Nay, than you are a looser. Nem. Didst thou see her pass? Vid. I didâshe wrung me by the hand and sigh'd, Then look'd back twice, And totter'd on the threshold at the door. Nem. Believe that you shall never see me moreâshe Lyes, I'll Wager my State, I Bed her eighteen months three weeks hence, at half an hour past two in the Morning. Vid. Why Faith, and that's as exact as e'er an Astrologer of 'em all. Nem. Give me thy hand, Vidam, I know the Souls of Women better than they know themselves; I know the Ingredients just that make 'em up, All to loose Grains, the subtlest volatile Atoms, With the whole Mish-mash of their Composition. Heark there without, the voice of Marguerite, Now thou shalt see a Battle worth the gazing, Mark but how easily my reason flings her, And yet at last I'll swing into Friendship Because I love herâ Enter Bellamore. Bell. The Princessâshall I stop her? Nem. No, let her come, With flying Colours, and with beat of Drumâ Like the Fanatick, I'll but rub me down, And then have at her, Vidam, stay you hereâ By Heav'n I'm jealous of this changeable Stuff, Therefore the hits will be the livelier o'both sides, The Dauphin, but no moreâshe comes, she comes. Enter Marguerite pushing Bellamore. Marg. Be gon, Villain, Devil, Fury, Monster of a Man. Nem. But hear me but six words in private. Enter Poltrot, Celia. Pol. And I swear by this lascivious bit of Beauty, I will cleave to my Celia for Better for Worse, in Searge, Grogrum or Crape, though a Queen shou'd come in my way in Beaten Goldâ Nem. What then, Gentlemen, I perceive there have been Wars at homeâ Pol. Not a Battle, my Lord, only a Charge, a Charge sounded or so. Nem. What was it a Trumpet, or through a Horn Sir? Pol. A Horn Sir, a Horn Sir, no Sir, 'twas not a Horn SirâOnly my Celia was a little disdainful, but we are Friends agen Sir, and what then Sir? Nem. Come, come, all Friends, were Tournon here I wou'd forgive her, a litte Scorn in a pretty Woman, so it be not too much affected, is a Charm to new Friendship; therefore let each Man take his Fair one by the hand, thus lay it to his Lips, and Swear a whole Life's Constancyâ St. A. As I will to my Nelle, though I haule Cats at Sea, or cry Small-coal; and for him that upbraids her, I'll have more Bobs, than Democritus when he cry'd Poor-Jack. There's more Pride in Diogenes, or under a Puritan's Cap, than in a King's Crown. Nem. For my part, the Death of the Prince of Cleve, upon second thoughts, has so truly wrought a change in me, as nothing else but a Miracle cou'dâFor first I see, and loath my DebaucheriesâNext, while I am in Health, I am resolv'd to give satisfaction to all I have wrong'd; and first to this Lady, whom I will make my Wife before all this Company e'er we partâThis, I hope, whenever I dye, will convince the World of the Ingenuity of my Repentance, because I had the power to go on. He well Repents that will not Sin, yet can, But Death-bed Sorrow rarely shews the Man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. What is this Wit which Cowley cou'd not name? The rare Inducement to a perfect Fame, The Art of Nature curious in a Frame. Is it a Whig, a Trimmer, or a Tory, Or an Old Fop forgotten in the Story? 'Tis Honour veil'd in Honesty's Disguise, Or Cesar like a Fencer in a Prize; 'Tis Pindar's Ramble, Nature in Misrule, A Politician acted by a Fool. 'Tis all Variety that Arts can give, The Danaid's filling of a Leakey Sieve: The Valleys Sweets, and the distilling Spring, The brimming Bacchus that the Muses bring, To drink the Health of England's Glorious King. A Statesman thoughtful for a Clown revil'd, A Pestle and a Mortar for a Child. 'Tis a true Principle, but hardly shown, An Artificial Sigh, a Virgins Groan, When the first night her Lover layes her on. 'Tis like a Lass that Gads to gather May, 'Tis like the Comedy you have to day, A Bulling Gallant in a wanton Play. FINIS.</field>
