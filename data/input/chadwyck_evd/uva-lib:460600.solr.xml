      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —The Convent Cloysters. Prior and Confessor. Prior. Say, hast thou found Alfonso? Conf. No, good Prior. He mus'd not in his cell; nor duly came To join th' assembled Monks, Ere the fix'd duties of the Convent call'd Each to his separate office. Prior. 'T is most strange! Conf. I have made careful search, and closely question'd The brethren, one by one. Prior. Who last beheld him? Conf. Anselmo. He, with eye that swam in tears, Said, that at dawn, while he unbarr'd the gates, Alfonso darted forth ungreeting by him, Striking his breast in anguish. Prior. Heaven protect him! Sooth, all ye sainted host, his woe-worn soul! Conf. Alas! my mind misgives me— Prior. How? Conf. I fear We shall not see him more. Unhappy man! His troubled spirit, that oft sorely griev'd us, Seems, with increase of horrors, day by day, Rack'd, as the time draws near, When our good Provost to these walls returns, To fix anew our duties. Much, methinks, He dreads the issue of that solemn inquest, Which, or confirms him in his perilous charge, His only solace; or for ever drives him From this lone roof, that long has sooth'd his woe, Hid from the world. To him he must reveal The secret of his soul, That inly preys upon him. Prior. Holy saint Thou that didst found 'mid everlasting snows These walls, thy earthly residence, look down, Look down, on him whose unexampled zeal, At life's dread risque, has highly minister'd To thy most blest intent. Hear, holy Bernard! Nor to the storm and conflict of wild passion Abandon poor Alfonso. Conf. Yes, my brother, Service like his, nor wealth, nor worldly honours, Gain or repay: its source is in the heart: And in the spirit that there prompts to act, Finds its sole recompense. Prior. If kindliest deeds, That sooth the woe of others, The pilgrim, houseless wanderer, and lone stranger, Could heal the wound that bleeds with inward pangs, Peace on his soul had shed her lenient balm. But 'tis not so with him. Conf. Oh, many a time, When the lost travellers, whom his arm, from far, Bore 'mid the howling night-storm, whom his hand, Long chaf'd before the hearth, First turn'd th' awaken'd eye on poor Alfonso, Who hung all pity o'er the seeming corse; How have I seen him, from his dark cheek, dash The tear away, and fly the open'd lip, That pour'd its blessing on him! Enter Steward, with Laymen. Stew. Haste, my friends! Rake up the embers, pile the glowing hearth: The sight shall cheer him, and the crackling blaze Waft grateful fragrance round. Then, deck the board, And freely cull what best may furnish out Our frugal banquet. [Exeunt Laymen, Conf. Whence this sudden haste? Stew. (Regardless of the question.) Ring out the Convent bell, that the loud peal Recall each absent brother. None must fail Of their accustom'd duty. Prior. Stay, good Steward. Stew. The Provost is expected. Nay, each moment We look to greet him. Prior. All good angels guide him! But say, who brought The welcome news? for scarce the lower rocks Peep through the snow: and, save some pilgrim, bound On fearful penance, and that mournful train, Which left at morn the Convent, none have dar'd The dangerous pass. Stew. You know the southern Guide. Prior. What! faithful Gaspar! who for many a season Has claim'd the Convent prize, his custom'd due, Who from the path first clears the drifted mass? Stew. The same—he left our long-expected Provost, Now as he slowly up the mountains toil'd. Farewell—my charge awaits me. [Exit Steward. Prior. Alas! no common call has forc'd good Albert, Bow'd down with age, to leave, in this rude season, The shelter of the vale. 'T is not alone to fix our separate charge: Mandates from Rome, strictly to scrutinize Each layman, and paid hind that serves the Convent, (For rumour bruits of bad men harbour'd here,) Now urge his step. Conf. Full well we know his mission, That shames this sacred roof. Alas! that malice Should feign, that here the ruffian, and fell murderer, Unquestion'd guests, have found familiar shelter! Such haunt not here. Sad years of ceaseless war, That long have wasted fair Italia's plain, Turning to dreary waste her fruitful soil, Have steel'd men's hearts: and, haply, from the camp, Outcasts, who prowl where late the battle bled, And pluck, 'tis said, while the warm blood yet flows, The covering from the wound, at times have sought Night shelter from the storm. Else, never here, Save in the pitiless hour, when all are welcome, Have lawless men found refuge. Prior. Go, my brother— Ere Albert yet arrives, go search once more Alphonso's lonely haunt—Heav'n guide thy steps! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The wildest Alpine scenery of ice mountains, and precipices covered with snow, in the environs of the Great St. Bernard, leading to the Vallais. The Travellers are seen on the different heights, slowly descending the Pass, amid the windings of the rock. First Francis, with two Guides, exploring the way, and sounding the hollows with long poles: then Agnes preceding a litter. Last, the Litter, borne by the Mountain Peasants; on each side of it, a female Attendant, followed by a Page. Agnes. Oh glorious sun! illumin'd by thy beams, These Alpine solitudes, these wastes of snow, Boast charms and beauties of peculiar grace, That seem to soothe me. [Advancing, and looking on different sides. How distinct each rock Smooth-brow'd, or spiring high its tapering peak! Yon range of wavy sweep! and this, that breaks Eastward, in thousand forms, like floating clouds! Their hues, how changeful! these of roseate glow; Those azure dy'd; and some, that climb the sky, Fling to the light their summits cop'd with gold, All-gracious Heav'n! how wondrous these thy works! Sublimely awful! Fran. (To the Guides.) Every step we tread Leads to new danger. Guide. Sound that snow-heap'd cave. Fran. How fearfully yon tumbling rock o'erhangs The narrow pass. (Turns to Agnes.) Beware. Agnes. Proceed, good Francis. Fran. There yawns a chasm, down whose depth the sight Wanders without repose. I'll gaze no more: Its very horror, while it shocks the sense, Most strangely fascinates. (Advances.) These slippery fragments, Hurl'd by the tempest from the crags above, Roll loose beneath me.—(Comes to Agnes.) Lady! let me aid you. Lean on this faithful arm. Agnes. My foot treads firm. To those that know not grief, such ways are painful. I have, within my soul, what mocks at toil. Fran. You were in luxury nurs'd, nor have been us'd To scenes like these. I, in my childhood, rock'd In want's stern cradle, bred to ambuscades, 'Mid craggy steeps, here feel my weary limbs Ache, as I labour on. Oh, ever-honour'd lady! The holy brothers of St. Bernard warn'd you Not to attempt the pass. Return, I pray— Yet, yet amid the rocks, a lingering echo Heaves back the slow clang of the Convent bell, Hollowly sounding— It is for you I fear. Agnes. My will is fix'd. Go with the guides, and timely warning give If aught impede the way: the topmost snow, Heav'd by the zephyr's breath, may swell before it To size impassable. Fran. I must obey. Agnes. (Turning back to those who bear the litter.) Be careful, I beseech you. That steep path Betrays th' unsteady foot. Guard well the litter; Ye shall not lack reward, nor thanks that flow From one of grateful nature.— Gentle maids, Be watchful of your charge. I first myself Will this sharp ridge explore—So may'st thou, Ellen, Securely pass, and, ere death close thy woe, Find peace once more. Fran. (To the Guides.) Heard you that sound? Guide. Most plainly. The voice of men advancing. Fran. List! again! Up as the gale comes slowly from beneath, I hear distinct the noise of echo'd steps. Guide. 'Tis strange in this new season—so far well:— The rocks below are open. (Enter Claude.) Welcome, Claude: How fares the reverend Provost? Claude. He will be here in th' instant—hark!—they come.— Lady! I pray you, let the litter rest! And, in yon scoop'd-out cave, that fronts the sun, Wait, till his train pass by.—This narrow ridge Will else your lives endanger. [Exit Claude. Agnes. Repose a while, my friends; and in that cave Set down the litter. Your good Provost comes. Not these bleak rocks alone, and th' Alpine swains Echo his praises: far and wide his virtues Call down the general blessing on his head. Enter the Provost and his Train—As they pass on, Agnes speaks. Your benediction, father. Prov. Peace be with you! These widow's weeds—this melancholy train! Daughter! you seem in woe.—Adversity, Methinks, sore bows you down: and pale your cheek Through sorrow more than years. What urgent cause At life's dread hazard, in this perilous season, Compels you to these mountains? Agnes. Holy father! I pray you pardon me: nor deem me one Rude, or untouch'd by kindness, that I leave you, My tale of grief untold. The Power who tries The mourner, smites in mercy, nor abandons Those that have trust in Heav'n. Thy voice has blest me. Farewell. Prov. Yet mark me, daughter. No vain wish To hear what may in utterance grieve thy spirit, And ill may suit my years; but sacred duties, By Heav'n enjoin'd, and sympathy of nature, That bid an old man, vers'd himself in woe, Feel for the woe of others, prompt my speech— Can I in aught assist you? Agnes. By thy prayers. When thou dost pray for those that grieve on earth, Father, remember me. (Going.) Prov. Yet—there are lenient words, Balm of the soul—Oh, hear me— My way of life has been where sorrow sigh'd, And anguish groan'd around me; and I know, There is at times a quality in grief That seems to soothe its sting, e'en while the mourner Inly in undivulging loneliness Broods on the secret pang that racks the soul. This must not be. Heav'n link'd us heart to heart, To double every pleasure, and, by sharing, Lessen the load of misery.—Silent still?— You turn away regardless. Agnes. No, good Provost;— Would I might freely at thy feet pour forth What weighs upon my heart. I am not one Infirm of mind, who broods o'er lonely woe. These tears, that will not be suppress'd, gush out Not for myself alone—Your farewell prayer— Trust me, the burden of my grief seems lighten'd, For thou hast pitied me. Prov. In silence mourn— I will not urge thee more. But I conjure thee, if thou value life, Turn to our hospitable roof again: There wait till fitter season may ensure Thy safe departure. Duty forc'd my step Now in this hazardous time. Not far the roof That shelters me. Thy way, alas! is long, And perils that no earthly eye foresees, Nor arm of man can ward, surround the path Where'er thou goest. And these lone rocks, at times, Are cross'd by ruthless robbers. Agnes. I must on. Prov. No roof, no shelter near, nor safe return If the dim night-fall steal on thee unwares; And oft the sun in these unsteady skies Is darken'd o'er with tempests. Agnes. I must on. (Pointing to the litter.) There lies a hapless woman, one who wastes Hourly away, worn out with ceaseless woe, An uncomplaining sufferer, nigh to death; A native of yon vale. Her only wish Is yet once more to view the peaceful spot To childhood dear, and there to find her grave Amid her kin.—Farewell. Prov. May Heaven protect thee! [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —The Convent Hall. The Prior, Provost, Confessor, Steward, other Brethren, and six Laymen of the House. Provost. Brothers, no charge of murder rests on them. Depart in peace, my friends (To the Laymen.)—Heaven's blessing on you. Would that the princes of the world, and those That sigh on golden beds, could lay, like you, Hands, innocent of ill, on guiltless hearts, And taste such sleep as yours!—Depart in peace. [The Laymen, &amp;c. depart. Enter Infirmier. Inf. Alphonso is return'd. Yet, hapless man! Prov. Why stands he not, as duty bids, before us? Inf. Oh! he is loath to come. Prov. This is most strange. Inf. I found him in the cemetery, lone, 'Mid many a stranger corse, unsepulchred, Still gazing on that pilgrim lately found, When slipp'd the snow-heap from the southern ridge: His face was yet unchang'd, and calm each feature As when he rested on the snow, while death Stole on his dream. So calm, Alphonso look'd; Such too his smile: each seem'd the other's image. Scarce could I tell who of the twain had life, Or who had ceas'd to breathe. Pardon me, fathers! Long time I fear'd to break that solemn trance; And, when at last I rous'd him— Conf. 'T was not kind To rouse him, brother; well I know his nature: You should have spar'd him yet a little while. 'T is long since holy peace has still'd his spirit; That time his soul had converse with his Maker. Prov. But when at last you urg'd him— Inf. At the word At once the trance dissolv'd. He started up, And frowning darkly on me, bade me say, That never earthly ear should hear his grief, If thou reject his pray'r, to wear out life Here amid perilous labours. Thus he left me, And onward 'mid the mountains swiftly rush'd, Regardless of my answer. Prior. Holy father, Send forth the Confessor; with him alone He communes willingly, but shuns us ever, Save when a sufferer common aid demands. Conf. Yes, I have sooth'd his melancholy soul, And won at times to half-form'd confidence, By tales of woe, which breath'd to common minds Had shap'd their spectred night-dreams. Still to these He gives most heedful ear. Prov. Go—soothe, persuade him. [Exit Confessor. It must be—strange, unexpiated guilt Harrows his soul. And was it right, good Prior, To give him charge among you? Prior. He deserv'd it.— Such thoughts as trouble you, at first came o'er us, When with wan look distraught, and wild attire, He call'd at midnight, when no foot beside Long time had scal'd the snow. Our wary eyes Watch'd o'er him. Stern his brow, and strange his mood; Yet, at our call submissive: so months past He still the same. When patient Anselm died, Heav'n rest his soul! he fell in manhood's prime, Worn out with toil; Alfonso, now long tried, Here vow'd to pass his dedicated days A cloister'd menial; and with earnest prayer Besought his perilous office. Look on us: Age and infirmity here bow before you; Point out the man whose limbs could stand that charge? Prov. None, none: I blame you not. But say, good Prior, How doth he exercise his charge? Prior. With zeal Passing belief; his labour shames our service. For still in boisterous months, when all within Shake at the barr'd-out blast; Singly he ventures forth, his dog sole guide, At starless midnight, or when drifted heaps Have hid the pass: nor seeks again the roof, (Though numbness steal upon his wearied limbs,) Till he has sounded each snow-cover'd cave, And long and loudly call'd, if heard from far Shrieks of the lost night-wanderer strike his ear. So pass his days away. Enter Claude. Claude. Oh, holy fathers! Prov. Claude!—What brings thee hither? Claude. Help! speedy help! or she for whom I beg Will not long need your succour. (To the Infirmier.) Good, good father! This is your office: yes, we know you well; We who frequent these mountains. Inf. (To Claude.) Where are the sufferers? And what their number? Claude. 'T is but one poor soul! A delicate, tender creature! one of those That left at morn your roof. Inf. But where, where are they? Claude. They had past the storm-house, Where, every day, at noon and fall of night, Ye kindly leave for those who chance may need A dole of bread and wine: this they had past A little space, when they who bore the litter In which she lay, slipt on the melted ice, And much I fear the fall has quite o'erpower'd her. I never thought that thing of such slight frame Could heave so deep a groan. And so I help'd them To bear her to the shed; then hurried hither To claim your aid. Inf. Come, honest Claude. (To the Monks.) Farewell! [Exeunt Infirmier and Claude. Prov. Heav'n guide, and prosperous issue crown thy zeal! Say, was she of that train whom late I greeted, Where, rushing from the mountain snows, the flood Ceaselessly roars? Prior. No other foot Has dar'd the pass. Prov. In vain I urg'd them back. Know you their names? Prior. They wish'd to be conceal'd. Some secret cause of grief ('t was whisper'd so) Silenc'd inquiry: yet, a prattling page That loiter'd o'er the hearth, said that his lady, The dark-stol'd dame, was Countess of Tortona: And he did hint of a sick peasant girl Tales of strange import. But we sought not out What misery wish'd conceal'd. (Bell strikes.) Prov. The noon-bell strikes. Come; holy duties claim unworldly thoughts. Here meet again. Alfonso must be question'd. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Lake on the South Side of the Convent, surrounded with Mountains.—At the back Ground Alfonso is discovered pacing restlessly to and fro.—The Convent is seen. Alf. It will not be concealed! Death! death! release me! Ye mountains! on whose heights, when first ye tower'd, Coeval winter stood! hoar cliffs! where time, From the first stretch and waving of his wing, Shed everlasting snows! hear, hear my voice! Fall on my brow! and thou, on which I tread, Immoveable rock! rive thy deep base beneath me! Nor give me back, 'till at th' appointed hour I, and each secret sinner upon earth, Stand up, and hear the doom that shall not change. Conf. (Without.) Alfonso! Enter Confessor. Alf. Ha! Conf. 'T is he! I long have sought thee—loudly call'd— And thrice the Convent bell has warn'd thee home. Alf. It 'scap'd me not unheard. Conf. The Provost sends me— Alf. Consents he to my wishes? Conf. Trust his kindness. Alf. He comes to search my soul. Conf. Not yours alone. Each layman, every hind that serves the house, Has render'd strict account. Alf. Pure, sinless souls! Why wound their spirit with unfounded questions? They have not shed man's blood. Conf. 'T is true, they urg'd the inquiry. Alf. And, ere now, Each to his day-task hies with lighten'd heart, Merrily trolling forth his mountain song, Each with the good man's blessing on his head. Conf. So shall thy soul find peace. Alf. Oh, never! never! Conf. Thou little know'st his kindness; but thy deeds Are known to him. Alf. (Disturbed.) What deeds? Conf. All, all, whate'er Zeal, unabated toil, and dauntless courage Have wrought at risk of life. Alf. Would I had died In rescuing those that suffer'd! Conf. Hear, Alfonso! His voice will sooth thy misery. He is not, as some are who wear our garb, Of soul austere: virtue in him beams forth With seraph mercy. Here his way of life, 'Mid scenes of suffering, but in closer bonds, Links him to those that suffer; and hoar age, That draws his spirit nearer to its God, Looks kindly back on those who toil below. If thou hast sinn'd, in him the penitent sinner Beholds a father. Alf. But I have not shed The tear of penitence that cleanses guilt. Who probes my soul, Must loath the thing I am. I shall pour forth To the astonish'd and incredulous ear Of this most sinless father, deeds of woe; Guilt that shall shock his nature, while he weeps In pity of man's weakness. Conf. Calm thy spirit. Alf. (Highly agitated.) These rocks have heard it, and the night-storm borne On his dark wing, 'mid cliffs and hollow caves, My echo'd groans; and I have quak'd to hear, When the gust paus'd, Sounds as of men, accomplices in blood, Muttering their tales of murder. Conf. Soothe him, Heav'n! Be calm, Alfonso; these wild bursts of passion Will but arouse suspicion.—Why thus grasp me? Alf. Suspicion! Who beheld me? Where th' accuser? Come to the Provost. Conf. Not till thou art tranquil. None, none shall see thee thus, so strangely mov'd. I oft have still'd thy grief. Alf. Thou art most kind. Conf. Look round; this scene shall soothe thy soul to peace. Long years may pass, ere in these storm-tost heights A sky so clear, air of such temperate breath, And sun with scarce a cloud to veil his glory, May visit us again. Alf. Oh, holy comforter! Scenes such as these have rais'd my voice in prayer 'Mid solitudes where none on earth could hear. Oh, that the innocent joys of days long past Might steal me from myself, like lenient dreams Of friends that are no more! Conf. Nay, inly brood not; Look on yon azure sky, and call on Heav'n.— Oh hang not o'er that lake. Why dost thou gaze so fixedly upon it? Alf. Look where the shape of yon o'erhanging crag That thwarts the sun, lies shadow'd in the lake, How suddenly the gathering ice shoots on, Chilling the wave beneath. (To himself.) E'en so it fares with me. The winter, here, Turns every object that the eye doth glance on To its own cheerless nature. (Starts back from the lake in frantic agitation.) Heav'n and earth!— Conf. Whence that wild look of horror? Alf. That, that form (Pointing to the lake.) Which scowl'd upon me there:—not earthly, sure! Oh, never yet did flesh and blood assume Such ghastly semblance! never living eye So look'd! Conf. Oh, merciful Heav'n! Alf. I conjure thee, Oh, tell me, am I then that ghastly form? Was it myself? was there none other here? Conf. It was thy shadow'd form. Alf. (Most vehemently.) Guilt, guilt is on me, Deep graven by the visible hand of Heav'n! Like his that bore upon his brow the blood Of the first slain.—Come! to the Provost, haste! [Exeunt. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —A Cave amidst the Mountains. Enter two Assassins. 1st Assassin. The time is past—they promis'd quick return. This steel lacks blood— 2d Assas. Our booty shall not fail—be patient, brother. 1st Assas. Why did you lure us from the southern plains? There still, if plunder fail'd, earth's grassy bed Refresh'd our weary limbs, and the blue sky Look'd kindly on our slumber—here— 2d Assas. Be patient— Our long-expected prize, Tortona's wealth, Ere long shall far o'erpay these transient toils. 1st Assas. Aye—If we seize the Countess— 2d Assas. If we seize her!— How can she escape? 1st Assas. The pass below is open, Secure from danger, by the Provost's guides Clear'd from the snows. 2d Assas. No—not if trusty Gualter Has faithfully obey'd me. 1st Assas. See—he comes. 2d Assas. Well!—Gaulter— Enter Gualter. Gual. All is done—prepare your poniards. Yet 'tis an easy prey—One man in arms Alone attends the dame—When I had track'd The Provost to the Convent, I return'd O'er crags unknown to others, And from the rock that butted o'er the path With this good pole Loosen'd the snow-mount—None can pass. 1st Assas. Away— Stab those that dare resist—but spare the Countess. Her ransom shall enrich us. Gual. Lead us forth. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Storm-house on one Side of the rocky Pass amid the Mountains. Enter Francis and Blanche. Blanche. The men are hurt—No golden bribe will tempt. Francis, the Countess wills that you proceed, And, ere assistance from the Convent come, Explore the rocks below. Fran. I shall obey: But say, how fares it with the hapless Ellen? For, though my soul abhor the deeds of guilt Caus'd by her fatal beauty; yet, in sooth, When I behold the sufferer rack'd with woe, Yet never uttering plaint, that no faint sigh May strike the Countess' ear; oh! when I view her In speechless anguish lifting her meek eye In pray'r to Heaven, the big tear gushes from me: And, hard as is my heart, and steel'd by war, I could, methinks, e'en with a father's fondness, Soothe her on this stern breast. Blanche. A leaden slumber, Still as the sleep of death, now lies upon her. Fran. Here may her miseries end! she has not strength To reach her native vale.—Unhappy Ellen! Far better hadst thou died, when first the Countess Found thee a stranger raving on the tomb Rais'd by her Lord's command—yet he, alas! He rests not there, but wanders o'er the world A wretch without a home!—I must be gone. Go to thy charge. Blanche. Good Francis! haste—farewell! [Exit Francis. Enter from a Cave—Agnes, Ellen (on a Litter) sleeping, and Laura. Agnes. So, gently bring her to the open air— A soothing sleep steals o'er her.—Soft she breathes! How sweet her tranquil look! and lo! that smile; As if an angel, touch'd with earthly woe, Look'd down upon her slumber. Blanche. Such art thou In mortal semblance. Agnes (Looking on her.) Sleep, poor hapless Ellen. Three painful years are past since I have watch'd thee, And laid thy stranger brow upon my breast, As that had been thy native nurturing place. I have assuag'd thy bitterness of grief, Sooth'd the wild dreams of a distracted mind, And led thee to the view of opening heaven, Where tears are turn'd to gladness; but such sleep, Till now, has ne'er been thine. If rightly wish'd! So sleep, and wake no more. Enter Francis. Agnes. Kind girls, Look to her slumber. We must speak apart. Fran. I have explor'd the further track. Agnes. Well! Francis— Fran. It is impassable. Agnes. Oh, say not so.— I will myself explore it. Fran. None can pass. The rocks more rugged far: and that bright sun, Which cheer'd at dawn of day, now past its noon, Has turn'd the melted ice to foaming streams. Agnes. Yet if the Convent send sufficient aid, Still, still we may proceed. Fran. Prone from a crag that overhung the pass, A snow-mount, lately fallen, has barr'd all progress. Some from the Convent soon will join our guide, And warrant safe return. And—pardon, Lady! I have long serv'd you— Agnes. Say whate'er thou wilt: Thy Lord high valu'd thee. Fran. Aye: these old arms Oft dandled him in childhood. Agnes. By his side Oft hast thou stood the battle, when brave chiefs Fled from the field. The man whom Julian honour'd, I hold my friend. Say on, nor fear offence. Fran. Would I had died in battle, at his feet, Ere this sad day; ere seen what now I see, The Countess of Tortona, like a slave Tending a peasant girl: one, too, who lur'd, Aye, and by witching wiles— Agnes. (Interrupting him.) No, not thy virtues, Nor privilege of years, nor length of service, Zeal for my house and honour, shall avail, If ere thy rash unhallow'd breath shall cast Disgrace on her. Rather aloud revile The memory of him whom most I honour; And who, but, but for this, had proudly soar'd 'Mid men, unrivall'd. If thou deem it base To serve my will, because I sooth her woe, Such service I disclaim. Gold thou shalt have, But never look to see my face again. Thou art in tears!—nay, rise. Fran. Not look on me! And give me gold at will! I am most base! I never felt what service was till now. If you do wish my death, bid me be gone. I rashly spoke what zeal for you inspir'd. She was not the seducer. Agnes. Peace, good Francis. You touch a string that vibrates on my heart: (To the Attendants.) Still calm her sleep? Blanche. Most tranquil. Agnes. Such repose, I fear, bodes nought but evil. From the Convent None yet arrive! 'tis vain, without their aid, To move her hence. Fran. They will be here, ere long. The Guide, whose ready zeal so won our hearts, Was fresh and nimble-footed. Agnes. Go, my friend! Yon height commands, afar, the winding path. Look if you see ought hastening. (Exit Francis.) Julian! Julian! Thy word enjoin'd not this: but not till death Has still'd that woe-worn frame, will I forsake her. But thou! Oh, art thou with the living, or with those That grieve no more; what earthly voice can speak? Since that dread hour, (oh, let me not recall it!) My search, how vain! and, save that fatal scroll Which bad me raise thy tomb, and deem thee dead, Gave me thy worldly wealth, and loos'd the tie That binds eternally my soul to thine, Of thee I nought have heard. Wert thou on earth, This, this had been thy office. No, I wrong thee. He who sustains my soul, and bids me here Shelter, in life's last agonies, the orphan, And her that has no helper, had once more Made one our wedded hearts. Enter Francis, the Infirmier, Claude, Page, Guide, and Laymen. Fran. Come, holy father. Infir. Where is the sufferer? Agnes. Here, in still repose, Infir. Has she long slumber'd thus? Agnes. An hour, or more. Infir. Rouse, rouse her quickly. Chafe her temples, lady! Apply this pungent spirit. Agnes. (Hearing Ellen sigh.) Oh, that sigh! Infir. You of the southern climes, you haply know not, Amid these chilling snows when sleep steals on How fatally it ends. The blood, too, rests, And every vital part forgets its function. Sleep here is but the harbinger of death. Agnes. The harbinger of death! Oh, rouse her not! Sir, she is broken-hearted—let her sleep, Sleep and wake never more. Infir. I must perform What duty bids; and with unwearied zeal Apply all earthly means to bring back life. The rest is Heaven's. Agnes. She stirs—stand, stand apart. How is it with you, Ellen? Ellen. Well, quite well. Free from all pain. Agnes. Your cheek, methinks, is ting'd With a faint flush, like renovated health: But weak, most weak your voice. Why do you gaze So earnestly around? Lo, here your friends, Those of my household, whom you ever lov'd, Blanche, and kind-hearted Laura, this good man, One of the Convent brethren. Ellen. I scarce knew Whether I breath'd or not. I've been in heaven: You, too, were there. Indeed I ever thought you Too good for this vile world. Agnes. Compose thyself. Ellen. I am most calm. Agnes. Oh, hush! Ellen. I am not wand'ring. But most distinctly as I now behold you, (pointing above.) I saw you there—and I, poor Ellen, help'd To place a crown of glory on your brow. And there came—one—I dare not, saint on earth, Before your honour'd presence, breathe his name. He, in this world, has had his doom of woe. Oh, say, that you forgive me—ne'er, till now, While my poor mind was mine— Infir. (Interrupting her.) This must not be! Daughter! be still—speak to her, gentle lady! Speak, if thy gushing tears permit the utterance. Agnes. Sweet Ellen! clasp my hand. Ellen. Thou more than parent! Had not your eye met mine, when first I 'woke, I had not thank'd this charitable man For forcing life upon me—Oh, I faint! Agnes. Here, on my bosom rest. Ellen. This is most kind. Yes, I shall soon have rest, eternal rest, And those thy heavenly crowns. (Faints.) Infir. Here, bear her up. Agnes. Oh, gently with her. [Exeunt. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Hall of the Convent. The Provost, Prior, Infirmier, Steward, in Council. Prior. I hear their steps. Alfonso (without). Alfon. That—that, or nought on earth Shall force it from me. Prior. Hark! it is his voice. We pray thee, kindly question him. Enter Alfonso and Confessor. Prov. Alfonso! In me behold a father in your judge. I come not arm'd with harsh authority To wound th' afflicted spirit, And from the bleeding breast untimely pluck Th' unripe confession: rather mine to praise Thy matchless deeds, and here, before the brethren, Proclaim thy high desert. Alfon. It is the motive Alone that sanctions all. I claim no praise. Prov. Alfonso! If thy conscience inly goad thee, Bow not beneath despair. Whate'er thy crime, Know, that unceasing, at the gates of mercy, A beck'ning spirit calls aloud to earth, “Thou! that hast sinn'd, repent, and sin no more: “Kneel here, and enter in.” Alfon. Yes—I have sinn'd. Prov. So have we all. Alfon. But mine are deadly sins. Prov. The mere avowal of unwitness'd guilt Brings solace in the utterance: and the spirit, Confession made, springs loosen'd from a load That sorely gall'd. Know, too, our holy church Has pray'rs and penances of power to cleanse The soul from all infection. Art thou one Who once knew better days: one, whom fair fortune Lur'd forth to summer seas, then left at once A lonely wreck? Alfon. I have known better days. (To himself) No other terms shall force the secret from me. Prov. Discourse not with thyself—to me give answer. Hast thou, by stern necessity compell'd To deeds against thy nature, linkt with men Of lawless life, and stain'd thy soul with blood To silence the accuser? Prior. Holy Provost! We, we will answer this. No stain of blood Has touch'd Alfonso. Alfon. Answerest thou for me? You know me not, nor e'er shall hear my crime (To the Provost) Till you have promis'd, nay, by oath confirm'd, That whatsoe'er the guilt which I reveal, You will not drive me hence. Thus far be known; That of such deeds as now you question me, Wealth gain'd by rapine, and deliberate murder To silence the accuser, I am guiltless. Vow this, or I am mute. Prov. Hear, man of guilt! And when I speak with Heaven's authority, Bow to the dust. Alfon. Guilt, guilt doth weigh me down: But I'll not speak; nor shall ye force me hence. Look here. Behold this scar: no battle wound, Tho' I have bled in war. 'Twas this, this hand Struck at my life; and, if ye force me hence, Think on his guilt, the slayer of himself. Beware! beware!—ye know not what it is: But I have fought the demon of despair, And sunk beneath the strife. Prov. Sinner, I come, Such as thou art, the heir of frailty, Shackled and gall'd with man's infirmities, To weep with thee, to bend my knee with thine; Teach thee, like me, to raise thy hands in pray'r, And meekly shed the penitential tear That drops down healing. Speak to me, my Son! He, who conjures thee, spreads a Father's arms To fold thee to his bosom. Alfon. Kind, kind man! Thou shalt hear all. I will obey thy voice: But oh! in pity, force me not, I pray thee, To that strange world below: here let me labour What yet remains of life. Not long the term. Vigils and painful service soon must end me. Look on this wasted frame. Prov. I grant thy pray'r.—Here rest in peace, If peace here visit thee. Alfon. Thanks, gracious father! (kneels to him) Prov. Disclose thy name, thy rank, what urg'd thee hither, And what mysterious motive still enchains thee To such dread hazards that the oath-bound monk Shrinks from the yoke. Alfon. Father! my name is Julian, Tortona's Count.— Prior. Thou! thou! Tortona's Count! 'Twas but this morn— Alfon. Nay, if you disbelieve— You'll hear strange things. Prov. (to the Prior.) Be silent:—one rash word Confuses all. Alfon. (confusedly.) About my twentieth year— Ten years now past: nay wonder not! these locks, Once dark as jet, on sudden chang'd to grey: That night I stabb'd myself; and whence this cheek, With more than time's deep traces sadly furrow'd, Your haunts can witness—at my twentieth year— Oh had I ere that time, But tasted at the brim, but sip'd one drop Of that sad cup whose bitter dregs I drain, Haply had I not been the man I am. I am a man of guilt: but guilt I loath'd: Virtue had charms for me—but oh! it sprung not From its sole source, the will of him in Heaven— 'Twas but the sunshine of life's golden day Unclouded by temptation—pray your pardon— Where left I off?— Prov. You said your twentieth year— Alfon. That was the time when brave Novara's lord, Stricken in years, but still in heart a warrior, Bad hold a tournament; his daughter's hand The envy'd prize: if he, that foil'd the field, Made oath, when wedded, at his own free charge, To arm five hundred knights, all cas'd in steel, In right of Sforza's heir, from Milan's throne Driv'n by ambitious France. Prov. We know those wars. Alfon. I went, and won the prize—a beauteous bride; One, whose rare mind, high character'd, o'erpast All that the eye presag'd of inward worth. Ill-fated Agnes! breath'd a man on earth Who slightingly had nam'd thee, on his head My sword had thy pre-eminence maintain'd Peerless above thy sex.—Yet,—her—I left— Not then—Not then—five years first glided by And happiness was—her's— Then came the wars, and all the accidents Of doubtful conflict—with our forces march'd The Banneret that led the hardy Swiss. One, for his skill in arms, call'd from his flock: A swain, but proud of soul; What needs his name? that time I sav'd his life; And he too rescu'd me—him—him—I,—murder'd. Prov. Oh Heaven! Him! who had sav'd thy life? What demon urg'd thee? (highly agitated.) Alfon. Here, here he smote me—the wide world, the world Has rung with my disgrace—a soldier's blood Boils in these veins!— He should have plung'd his dagger in my heart, As mine was sheath'd in his: That had been noble vengeance!—but a blow! Prov. Vengeance! for what? Alfon. His sister!—Oh! his sister!— Ah, miserable Ellen! her I wedded. Prov. You said Novara's daughter was your wife. Alfon. Yet, yet—I wedded Ellen—did'st thou think One of her purity, not angels purer, Had deign'd to meet my love, but that she deem'd A husband's rightful arms were link'd in her's? Prov. But where is Ellen? Alfon. O, O, O!— Prior. Forbear, forbear. Prov. His tears gush forth—Oh, may it soothe his soul! Prior. Oh, cease to torture him. Alphon. A little while— Kind men—I will be brief—Ye must not leave me. It weighs less heavy here. Prov. Another time,— Alphon. Heav'n may not grant again an hour like this— In the last battle at Novara's siege, When from their steeds dismounted, Gaul's brave knights Stood with portended spears, in firm array, Immoveable:—When fear had seiz'd our host,— The Banneret and I, in arms sworn brothers, Rush'd emulous on, and in our breasts receiv'd Th' opposing points. Our men the opening made, Follow'd and conquer'd. As we, bleeding lay, “Be thou” (he said) “a brother to an orphan, “Who has but me”—I vow'd, and swoon'd upon him. When next I woke, 'twas in Novara's walls: Of him no more was known. Prov. You said you slew him. Alphon. You shall hear all. Sforza restor'd, when war had ceas'd to rage, My name and rank disguis'd, I went as one Dear to her brother: and within a dell Lock'd in by heights which scarce the neighb'ring swain Crost with his flock in summer, found the orphan. Oh, at the sight of her the peasant girl!— —Spare the recital— I woo'd, I won, I wedded her.— Prov. How!—wedded?— Alphon. Aye, and time flew by On wings of rapture, while remembrance slept. But when the fiend was rous'd, fang'd scorpions stung me. At times, false cause pretended, I withdrew, Short absence, to Tortona—there the smile That ever met me, no harsh question ask'd, Arm'd with new sting the viper at my heart. I had less keenly suffer'd, had reproof Scowl'd at my entrance. It was never so— But, oh the curse! While Agnes clasp'd my neck, My thought was of another!—On a day, When, as our wont, gay revels rous'd Tortona In honour of our nuptials; as the pomp Mov'd on, the Countess radiant at my side: Forth rush'd the Banneret— “Traitor! receive from him who sav'd thy life, “Fit meed for guilt like thine”—He spoke, and smote me, Smote me, Novara's daughter by my side. Then my swift steel— Prov. I thought— Alfon. 'Twas there he fell— But died in Ellen's arms:—and his last breath Bound her to break the tie that lockt her soul To perjury and murder.—I return'd— At sight of me, for still our hearts were one, Her woe to frenzy rose. That time, this hand Aim'd at my life. Heav'n will'd not so my death, Tho' rumour widely spread it.— Prov. At our hearth We, too, have heard, confus'dly told, the tale. And the hous'd pilgrim still describes the tomb Rais'd by thy Countess: where, each day and night, All hours, unwearied orisons call down Heaven's mercy on thy soul. Alfon. The loud report Had struck on Ellen's ear—for now she knew Her base seducer was Tortona's Count. Prov. How! Alfon. The Banneret (Escap'd from chains, where ruthless foes had doom'd him) Found on her neck my picture—but no voice E'er told, till now, that I, Tortona's Lord, Garb'd like a peasant of the northern Alps, Watch'd at craz'd Ellen's side, where'er she stray'd, Begg'd from poor hinds, and forc'd, where prayers avail'd not, The scanty meal that fed her. None e'er told That oft, to soothe her woe, o'er pathless crags, I toil'd and smooth'd her way to Milan's vale; And clasp'd her in these arms when on my tomb She sunk in tearless swoon. 'Twas never known, When months had thus gone by, and lenient Time Had still'd her groans: that while, with heav'n-rais'd eye She breath'd my name, and kiss'd my pictur'd form, That I, forgetful, gaz'd too fondly on her, And all the truth flash'd forth. Prov. Unhappy man!— Alfon. She, methought, started from my arms, while tears Gush'd down her glowing cheek— Then turning suddenly to one I saw not, “Rest! Shade! be thou obey'd!”—And thus addrest me:— “Kneel on this tomb, and swear by him in Heaven, “Thou ne'er wilt trace my wanderings; ne'er enquire “If weal or woe betide, ne'er look on Ellen, “Till dead, or dying—Swear, that so my blessing “May rest on thee hereafter.”—I obey'd— Nor ever saw her more—Where is she now?— Is the deep slumber of the grave upon her? Weeps she, or raves, lone, reft of every friend, While scorn casts curses on her? Prov. Restrain him—he is frantic—soothe him Heaven! Alfon. (After violently struggling, breaks from them.) Ye shall not hold me here, unseen by men. No, I will stalk commission'd o'er the world Like Heav'n's enquiring spirit—Guilt shall shake At my approach, and youth turn grey before me. Look, when I view the boy in lustihood Of health and beauty, as he reels along To the deluded virgin, in his grasp This hand shall fix a dagger. At my bidding The breast, that glow'd beneath his touch, shall bleed. She, too, shall deem the blow (hear! Ellen! answer.) Far kinder than the kiss that fir'd her soul. There end her woes; and while she rests in peace, His eye may look on Heaven—Mine, never more. (bursts away.) Prov. Haste! haste! O'ertake him—Bring him back, my brothers! (Exeunt.)

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Mountains, covered with Snow, surrounding the Pass on the North Side of the Convent. Alfonso, (climbing over the rocks.) Alfon. What! force me back! Roof me in cloister'd cells, where never sun Glanc'd on the face of man! Must they explore Which way I tread: and track me to my haunts, Like a lone beast that makes his viewless lair In the unfrequented wilderness! What! am I? A wretch, moon-stricken, to be ey'd and bound; Unfit to bide where man makes residence? Would that I were not what indeed I am! Or being what I am, in form a man, That Heav'n had cast me in the idiot mould Of those that in the valley gasp in the sun With disproportion'd throats, and uncouth limbs That know not their own use! Confessor. (without.) Conf. Alfonso! ho! Alfon. Shout on—shout on—here none will look to find me,— Or if they chance to spy me, who will dare Climb up this giddy edge? They nigh had seiz'd me, But for that jutting point, on which I sprung, While they past on beneath. Enter Infirmier and Confessor. Infir. See you the track Of his uncertain step amid the snows? Conf. It ceas'd on sudden. Infir. Long my eye pursu'd it In mazy shiftings all irregular. Conf. Aye, purposely confus'd to mock pursuit. He's fled! I fear, for ever. Alfon. (wildly laughing.) Ha! ha! ha! (behind the rock.) Infir. Heard you that noise? Conf. Sure from the air it burst; For never foot of man E'er scal'd those cliffs.—Say, whither shall we turn? Your counsel, brother— Infir. Let us once more hail him. Alfonso!—ho!—Alfonso!—(clashing of swords without.) Agnes. (without.) Agnes. Murder—Murder! Francis (without.) Fran. Help!—from the Convent help.— Conf. What cry is that? Infir. I hear the tread of feet. Enter Francis (wounded.) Infir. Speak, wherefore thus? Thy looks are wild!—Ha! there is blood upon thee— Fran. Your limbs are fresh—Fly—to the Convent haste. Ring out the alarum bell.—Oh, haste!—Assassins, Disguis'd like those that on the mountains urge The chamois chace, have seiz'd the hapless ladies. I battled long as these sore-mangled limbs Could stand their poinards. Alfon. (leaping from the rock, and snatching his sword.) Lo! th'avenger here. Wash off, kind heav'n! the murder on my soul By the assassin's blood.—Come—lead the way— I have in battle cop'd with mighty men, And foil'd proud warriors.— Fran. Give me, Sir, your hand— My wounds bleed fast. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Another Part of the Mountains. Agnes, Ellen, and Four Assassins. Agnes. If 'tis my wealth you seek, I gave you all. 1st Assassin. Dame! if your strength had match'd your fearless spirit, Your wealth had ne'er enrich'd us. Agnes. (to the other Assassins who are going to bind Ellen.) Bind her not— She scarce has power to lift her hands in pray'r. Ellen. Oh, wound her not! Here, here, good men! these stones, they say, are diamonds.— This had escap'd you. Take it—spare her life— 'Twas once a nuptial present. (Kisses the picture.)—So farewell— I fondly thought to have worn thee in the grave. Spare but her life, and I shall die content. (Swoons.) Agnes. Hear me, unhappy men, and when ye know My rank and power, obey me. Mark my words— I am Tortona's countess, and I come To bear this sufferer, more than daughter to me, To the lone vale below that gave her birth. Let me pass on, and this last duty pay, And, by yon heav'n I vow, Whene'er you shew this ring, I will redeem it With riches that shall free your future days From deeds of guilt. Assassin. Go—plunge that peasant girl Within yon snow-pit. (Ellen is drag'd off.) Agnes. Restore her to my arms, I will repay you With wealth, a monarch's ransom—Ye shall banquet In golden halls, and o'er your tombs I'll raise Convents, where holy men, by force of pray'r, Shall save your souls from fiends. 1st Assassin. You promise rarely. Alfonso (without). Alfon. Die, wretch!—Good brethren, bear her to the Convent! Agnes. Heaven! I hear the voice of succour.—Man! unhand me.— (struggling.) 1st Assassin (going to stab her). Nay, if you struggle, lady, you are dead. Alfonso, rushing in, stabs one of the Assassins, and, in struggling with the other, who flies, is himself wounded. Alfon. This to thy heart. Fly, murderer—thou art free. Agnes. Oh, what words Can rightly praise; what earthly gifts reward thee? Thus on thy hand, the Countess of Tortona Prints the warm kiss of gratitude. Alfon. (looking up to Heaven). O, strike me dead! Agnes. What! for this deed?—Let it not grieve thy soul. Long ages past, a voice from Heaven decreed, “Who spills man's blood, by man his blood be spilt.” Alfon. But, but, forgive me. Agnes. In what hast thou offended? Alfon. I have left The path where virtue clasp'd me: I have strown In the smooth vale of innocence and peace Rank baleful seed: and I have pluck'd its fruit That leaves a scar and blister on the soul, When all of earth sinks to its native dust. Thou know'st me now. Agnes. In truth, I know thee not. Lift up thy cowl, thy features may instruct me. Alfon. Oh! ask not that—you'll turn away in horror. Let me depart unknown.—Yet, oh! her pardon. I am—How shall I dare to look on thee?—I was, In happier years, when virtue led my steps, Thy husband. Agnes. Thou my husband!— (Recollecting him, screams.) Julian, Julian— And yet I knew thee not.—These arms shall hold thee, Husband.— Alfon. Oh! sound—once grateful to my soul. But do not stain thy unpolluted lip.— Look—look not on me so.—Oh! if thine eye Flash'd vengeful lightning, I'd not turn away. Why dost thou weep?—I cannot shed a tear. Agnes (embracing him). Weep in these arms; And, as I clasp thee to my heart, recall Past years of bliss scarce earthly?—Oh, recall The nuptial vow that link'd our hearts in one; And the fond hope, oft breath'd in prayers to Heaven, That in each others arms, blessing and blest, Our life at once might close. It hath pleas'd The Searcher of the heart, by misery's test, To prove my soul: and here 'mid lonely wilds, Where none but Heaven can witness, I invoke Its minist'ring host again to grave the vow That links my lot to thine.—O, Julian, Julian, Come to my arms, and be at peace once more. Alfon. I have borne unmov'd The shock of sternest horror—but thy kindness,— Agnes!—I thought not ever to have known The blessing of such tears— Agnes. Oh, thou hast groan'd, In bitterness of spirit, to the storm That smote thee, sweeping by on icy wing: And none has listen'd to thy woe, no voice Spake consolation. Behold me, now, Firm at thy side, more blest to stand the storm, And sooth thy misery, than in thoughtless years, When, the vain partner of thy joys alone, I glitter'd in thy sunshine. Alfon. Heaven reward thee— Agnes. Heaven hath rewarded me.—Once more we meet. Oh, give me all thy grief, and I will steal Each pang away, and lull thee to repose. These arms amid the wilderness shall stretch Soft shelter o'er thee: here thy brow be pillow'd; And, ever as thou wak'st, the eye of Agnes Shall gladden thine; till, in the gradual peace That gains upon thee, I shall taste once more All bliss that earth can give. Alfon. (falling on her neck, then starts back in horror). Peace! never, Agnes, 'Tis virtue's heritage. Guilt, guilt is on me. Agnes. None o'er earth Pass without speck. Alfon. Mine is no common guilt. Agnes. Bow not beneath despair; but on the base Of firm repentance raise th' unshaken column Where virtue rests. Julian, I woo thee not To luxury, and light pleasures, and the dream Of joy departed.—No—but hand-in-hand, Oh, let us, in affliction doubly dear, Right onward journeying thro' the vale of woe, Soothe and support each other. Once again Here have we met; and never, never more, If virtue yet has force to sway the heart, Shall earthly power divide us. Thou art my husband still. Alfon. Thy husband!—Oh! thou know'st it not— I cannot tell it thee. Agnes. I know it all. Oh, thou art wounded—let thy wife support thee! Lean on me, Julian—let us to the Convent. Oh, no, not there—not there—and yet thou diest Here without succour. Alfon. No—Support me not. There was a time—Let me depart, I pray thee, While reason yet is mine.— Agnes. Alas! where seek For aid? Alfon. (more confus'd.) It is not here, this unfelt wound: 'Tis in my head, my heart: the fiend that tends On evil deeds is busy with my soul. Agnes. Father of mercy! calm his troubled spirit! Alfon. (frantic.) Woman! thou know'st me not—I know thee well. Thou art Novara's daughter, the fair prize. Gaily they came, brave gallants in their trim, High-plum'd, and banners floating.—The proud steeds Caparison'd, career'd beneath thy throne. Thou knew'st me then, when from the vanquish'd field I bore he blushing bride—But when he smote me, Thou looking on, upon my nuptial day, When the proud peasant smote me, at thy side, Thou did'st forget me— (Ellen screaming behind the scene.) Ellen. Restrain me not— Hold me not, holy Fathers: Now, now—they murder her—She bleeds, she bleeds, Beneath th' assassin's blow. (She rushes in with Provost, Prior, Infirmier, Confessor, Blanche and Laura.) Alfon. What voice is that? Prov. (to Agnes.) Oh sooth this frantic sufferer! Agnes. Ellen! here. Alfon. Ellen—and raving—Spare me yet, ye fiends! Oh! any sight but that— Ellen. I saw their poniards quivering o'er thy brow: Art thou not wounded? Agnes. No, Ellen—Be at rest— Ellen. Then I shall die in peace. (faints away.) Alfon. Is she so near her end? I pray you mock me not.—Oh! is it Ellen? Lift me, and let me gaze upon her face: I may once more Look on her as she dies, and her pale lip May breathe forgiveness o'er me.— Agnes. She scarce has life—Long have I sooth'd her woe. Alfon. Oh! Agnes, Agnes!—How had I heart to wrong thee—Oh! thou saint— The measure is complete. The hand of death is on me—Oh that pang!— Father of mercy yet—a little while— That Ellen yet may pardon me.—My Agnes! I pray thee move that injur'd one to breathe A last forgiveness o'er me.—If thou ask it, Ellen will not deny thee— Ellen. Ha! that voice— Agnes. A cold dew stands On her pale brow. Prov. 'Tis the forerunner of approaching death. Agnes. Oh thou in Heav'n! Hear my sole wish—Yet, yet awhile keep back The stroke of death, and to herself restore her, That one last word may breathe o'er dying Julian Peace and forgiveness. Prov. Heav'n has heard thy voice— The recompense of virtue shall not fail, While God is judge above. Ellen. Oh call me not From Heav'n's eternal rest!—Most honour'd Lady! Art thou still near me? Agnes. Ellen—I have a wish— A pray'r to thee— Ellen. Oh may my spirit pass In granting it! Agnes. We soon shall part for ever. Ellen. Not so—We meet in Heaven. Agnes. But there is one— Poor Julian— Ellen. Oh that now poor Julian heard me!— Death, death is on me. Agnes. Ellen!— Here, Julian begs forgiveness.— Ellen. Where, where is he? I spoke it in my heart—Where art thou, Julian? Alfon. Here, Ellen, prostrate at thy feet. Ellen. In secret I still pray'd That thou might'st hear my blessing.— Give me thy hand—I cannot see thy face— My eyes grow dim—Thy honour'd hand, thou saint! (She joins their hands.) Thus I unite you—Heav'n has heard my pray'r.— Now, Julian, thou art blest—We meet in Heav'n. (Ellen dies.) Alfon. Father of mercy! thanks! Support me, Agnes! Oh that I ne'er had wrong'd thee!— Shed not a tear for me—for, oh my Agnes! Thus in thy arms to die, blest by thy pray'r, That calls down mercy on me, gives my soul The foretaste of hereafter.—Oh farewell!— I die in peace. (dies.) Agnes. Oh saviour of mankind! receive his spirit. Prov. Rise! virtuous mourner, rise! no earthly voice May still the pang thou feel'st—alone for thee Religion tow'ring o'er this under world Shall smooth the wings of time; and as the earth Grows dim beneath their shadow, drop the dew Of healing on thy woes—poor Peasant Girl— Oh! if a scoffer question, why the storms Beat on thy sinless brow, and laid thee low, Say, from thy seat in Heav'n! “Such fixt me here.”—So, silence thou the scoffer— For thee, Alfonso, tell the man of guilt, That Heaven, who purified thy soul And chasten'd with sore wounds, may summon him, Flush'd from the banquet where Sin ranks the guests, At once before the presence of his God— So shall he fly, forewarn'd the tempting fiend.— FINIS.</field>
