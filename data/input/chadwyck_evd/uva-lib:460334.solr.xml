      <field name="fulltext">The FRONTISPIECE. The Curtain rises, and a new Frontispiece is seen, joyn'd to the great Pylasters, which are on each side of the Stage: On the flat of each Basis is a Shield, adorn'd with Gold: In the middle of the Shield on one side, are two Hearts, a small Scrowl of Gold over 'em, and an Imperial Crown over the Scrowl; on the other, in the Shield are two Quivers full of Arrows Saltyre, &amp;c. Upon each Basis stands a Figure bigger than the life; one represents Peace, with a Palm in one, and an Olive Branch in the other Hand; t'other Plenty, holding a Cornucopia, and resting on a Pillar. Behind these Figures are large Columns of the Corinthian Order adorn'd with Fruit and Flowers: over one of the Figures on the Trees is the King's Cypher; over the other the Queens: over the Capitals, on the Cornice sits a Figure on each side; one presents Poetry crown'd with Lawrel, holding a Scrowl in one Hand the other with a Pen in it, and resting on a Book; the other painting with a Pallat and Pencils, &amp;c. On the sweep of the Arch lies one of the Muses, playing on a Base Voyal; another of the Muses, on the other side, holding a Trumpet in one Hand, and the other on a Harp. Between these Figures, in the middle of the Sweep of the Arch, is a very large Pannel in a frame of Gold; in this Pannel is painted on one side a Woman representing the City of London, leaning her Head on her Hand in a dejected Posture (shewing her Sorrow and Penitence for her Offences;) the other Hand holds the Arms of the City, and a Mace lying under it: on the other side, is a Figure of the Thames with his Legs shakle'd and leaning on an empty Urn; behind these are two Imperial Figures; one representing his present Majesty; the other the Queen; by the King stands Pallas (or Wisdom, and Valor,) holding a Charter for the City, the King extending his Hand, as raising her drooping Head, and restoring her to her ancient Honor and Glory: over the City are the envious devouring Harpyes flying from the face of Majesty: by the Queen stand the three Graces holding Garlands of Flowers, and at her feet Cupids bound, with their Bows and Arrows broken, the Queen pointing with her Scepter to the River, and commanding the Graces to take off his Fetters: over the King in a Scrowl, is this Verse of Virgil, Discite justitiam, moniti, &amp; non temnere Divos. Over the Queen, this of the same Author, Non ignara mali, miseris succurere disco.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE To the OPERA. By Mr. Dryden. Full twenty years and more, our lab'ring Stage Has lost, on this incorrigible age: Our Poets, the John Ketches of the Nation, Have seem'd to lash yee, ev'n to excoriation: But still no sign remains; which plainly notes, You bore like Hero's, or you brib'd like Oates. What can we do, when mimicking a Fop, Like beating, Nut-trees, makes a larger Crop? Faith we'll e'en spare our pains: and to content you, Will fairly leave you what your Maker meant you. Satyre was once your Physick, Wit your Food; One nourisht not, and t'other drew no Blood. Wee now prescribe, like Doctors in despair, The Diet your weak appetites can bear. Since hearty Beef and Mutton will not do, Here's Julep dance, Ptisan of Song and show: Give you strong Sense, the Liquor is too heady; You're come to farce, that's Asses milk, already. Some hopeful Youths there are, of callow Wit, Who one Day may be Men, if Heav'n think fit; Sound may serve such, ere they to Sense are grown; Like leading strings, till they can walk alone: But yet to keep our Friends in count'nance, know, The Wise Italians first invented show; Thence, into France the Noble Pageant past; 'Tis England's Credit to be cozn'd last. Freedom and Zeal have chous'd you o'er and o'er; 'Pray' give us leave to bubble you once more; You never were so cheaply fool'd before. Wee bring you change, to humour your Disease; Change for the worse has ever us'd to please: Then 'tis the mode of France, without whose Rules, None must presume to set up here for Fools: In France, the oldest Man is always young, Sees Opera's daily, learns the Tunes so long, Till Foot, Hand, Head, keep time with ev'ry Song. Each sings his part, echoing from Pit and Box, With his hoarse Voice, half Harmony, half Pox. Le plus grand Roy du Monde, is always ringing; They show themselves good Subjects by their singing. On that condition, set up every Throat; You Whiggs may sing, for you have chang'd your Note. Cits and Citesses, raise a joyful strain, 'Tis a good Omen to begin a Reign: Voices may help your Charter to restoring; And get by singing, what you lost by roaring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE To the OPERA. By Mr. Dryden. After our Ãsop's Fable, shown to day, I come to give the Moral of the Play. Feign'd Zeal, you saw, set out the speedier pace; But, the last heat, Plain Dealing won the Race: Plain Dealing for a Jewel has been known; But ne'er till now the Jewel of a Crown. When Heav'n made Man, to show the work Divine, Truth was his Image, stampt upon the Coin: And, when a King is to a God refin'd, On all he says and does, he stamps his Mind: This proves a Soul without allay, and pure; Kings, like their Gold, should every touch endure. To dare in Fields is Valour; but how few Dare be so throughly Valiant to be true? The Name of Great, let other Kings affect: He's Great indeed, the Prince that is direct. His Subjects know him now, and trust him more, Than all their Kings, and all their Laws before. What safety could their publick Acts afford? Those he can break; but cannot break his Word. So great a Trust to him alone was due; Well have they trusted whom so well they knew. The Saint, who walk'd on Waves, securely trod, While he believ'd the beckning of his God; But, when his Faith no longer bore him out, Began to sink, as he began to doubt. Let us our native Character maintain, 'Tis of our growth, to be sincerely plain. T'excel in Truth, we Loyally may strive; Set Privilege against Prerogative: He Plights his Faith; and we believe him just; His Honour is to Promise, ours to Trust. Thus Britain's Basis on a Word is laid, As by a Word the World it self was made. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT 1. Decorations of the Stage in the First Act. The Curtain rises, and there appears on either side of the Stage, next to the Frontispiece, a Statue on Horse-back, of Gold, on Pedestal's of Marble, enrich'd with Gold, and bearing the Imperial Armes of England: one of these Statues is taken from that of the late King, at Charing-Cross; the other, from that Figure of his present Majesty (done by that noble Artist Mr. Gibbons) at Windsor. The Scene, is a Street of Palaces, which lead to the Front of the Royal Exchange; the great Arch is open, and the view is continued through the open part of the Exchange, to the Arch on the other side, and thence to as much of the Street beyond, as could, properly be taken. Mercury descends in a Chariot drawn by Ravens. He comes to Augusta, and Thamesis. They lye on Couches, at a distance from each other, in dejected postures; She attended by Cities, He by Rivers. On the side of Augusta's Couch are Painted Towers falling, a Scarlet Gown, and Gold Chaine, a Cap of Maintenance thrown down, and a Sword in a Velvet Scabbard thrust through it, the City Arms, a Mace with an old useless Charter, and all in disorder. Before Thamesis, are broken Reeds, Bull-rushes, Sedge, &amp;c. with his Urn Reverst. Mercury Descends. Merc. Thou glorious Fabrick! stand for ever, stand: Well Worthy Thou to entertain The God of Traffique, and of Gain! To draw the Concourse of the Land, And Wealth of all the Main. But where the shoales of Merchants meeting? Welcome to their Friends repeating, Busie Bargaines deafer sound! Tongues Confus'd of every Nation? Nothing here but Desolation, Mournful silence reignes around. Aug. O Hermes! pity me! I was, while Heav'n did smile, The Queen of all this Isle, Europes Pride, And Albions Bride; But gone my Plighted Lord! ah, gone is Hee! O Hermes! pity mee! Tham. And I the Noble Flood, whose tributary Tide Does on her Silver Margent smoothly glide; But Heav'n grew jealous of our happy state: And bid revolving Fate, Our Doom decree: These two Lines are Sung by Reprises, betwixt Augusta and Thamisis. No more the King of Floods am I, No more the Queen of Albion, She! Sung by Augusta and Thamesis together. Aug. O Hermes! pity me! Tham. O Hermes! pity me! Aug. Behold! Tham. Behold! Aug. My Turrets on the ground That once my Temples crown'd! Tham. The Sedgy Honours of my Brow's disperst! My Urn reverst! Merc. Rise, rise, Augusta, rise! And wipe thy weeping Eyes: Augusta! for I call thee so! 'Tis lawful for the Gods to know Thy Future Name, And growing Fame. Rise rise, Augusta, rise. Aug. O never, never will I rise! Never will I cease my mourning, Never wipe my Weeping Eyes, Till my plighted Lord's returning! Never never will I rise! Merc. What brought Thee, Wretch, to this despair? The Cause of thy Misfortune show. Aug. It seems the Gods take little Care Of Humane things below, When even our Suff'rings here they do not know! Merc. Not unknowing came I down, Disloyal Town! Speak! did'st not Thou Forsake thy Faith, and break thy Nuptial Vow? Aug. Ah 'tis too true! too true! But what cou'd I, unthinking City, do? Faction sway'd me, Zeal allur'd me, Both assur'd me, Both betray'd me! Merc. Suppose me sent Thy Albion to restore, Can'st thou repent? Aug. My falshood I deplore! Tham. Thou seest her mourn; and I With all my Waters, will her Tears supply. Merc. Then by some loyal Deed regain Thy long lost Reputation, To wash away the stain That blots a Noble Nation! And free thy famous Town again From force of Usurpation! Chor. of all. We'll wash away the stain That blots a noble Nation, And free this famous Town again From force of Usurpation. [Dance of the followers of Mercury. Aug. Behold Democracy and Zeal appear, She that allur'd my Heart away, And He that after made a prey. Merc. Resist, and do not fear! Chor. of all.] Resist, &amp; do not fear! [Enter Democracy and Zeal attended by Archon. Democ. Nymph of the City! bring thy Treasures, Bring me more To waste in Pleasures. Aug. Thou hast exhausted all my Store, And I can give no more. Zeal. Thou Horny Flood for Zeal provide A new Supply; And swell thy Moony tide, That on thy buxom Back the floating Gold may glide. Tham. Not all the Gold the Southern Sun produces, Or Treasures of the fam'd Levant, Suffice for Pious uses, To feed the sacred hunger of a Saint! Democ. Woe to the Vanquisht, woe! Slave as thou art, Thy Wealth impart, And me thy Victor know! Zeal. And me thy Victor know, Resistless Arms are in my hand, Thy Barrs shall burst at my Command, Thy Towry Head lye low. Woe to the Vanquish'd, woe! Aug. Were I not bound by fate For ever, ever here, My Walls I would translate To some more happy Sphere, Remov'd from servile fear. Tham. Remov'd from servile fear, Wou'd I could disappear And sink below the Mayn; For Commonwealth's a Load My old Imperial Flood Shall never never bear again. Thamesis and Augusta together. A Commonwealth's a Load Our old Imperial Flood Shall never never never bear again. Dem. Pull down her Gates Expose her bare; I must enjoy the proud, disdainful fair. Haste, Archon, Haste To lay her waste! Zel. I'll hold her fast To be embrac'd! Dem. And she shall see A Thousand Tyrants are in thee, A Thousand thousand more in mee! Archon to Aug. From the Caledonion Shore Hither am I come to save thee, Not to force or to enslave thee, But thy Albion to restore: Hark! the peales the People ring, Peace, and freedom and a King. Chor.] Hark! the Peales the People ring. Peace and freedom and a King. Aug., Tham. To Armes! to Armes! Archon. I lead the way! Merc. Cease your Alarmes! And stay, brave Archon, stay! 'Tis Doom'd by Fates Decree! 'Tis Doom'd that Albion's dwelling, All other Isles excelling, By Peace shall Happy be! Archon. What then remaines for me? Merc. Take my Caduceus! take this aweful Wand, With this th'Infernal Ghosts I can command, And strike a Terror thro the Stygian Land. Common-wealth will want pretences Sleep will Creep on all his Senses; Archon touches Democracy with a Wand. Zeal that lent him her assistance, Stand amaz'd without resistance. Dem. I feel a lazy slumber layes me down! Let Albion! let him take the Crown! Happy let him reign, Till I wake again! [falls asleep. Zel. In vain I rage, In vain, I rouze my Powers; But I shall wake again; I shall to better Houres. Ev'n in slumber I will vex him; Still perplex him, Still incumber: Know you that have ador'd him, And Soveraign power afford him, Wee'll reap the gains Of all your paines And seem to have restor'd him! [Zel. falls asleep. Aug. and Tham. A stupyfying sadness Leaves Her without motion; But sleep will cure her madness, And coole her to Devotion. A double Pedestal rises: On the Front of it is painted, in Stone colour, two Women; one holding a double Fac'd Vizor; the other a Book, representing Hypocricy and Phanaticism; when Archon has charmed Democracy and Zeal with the Caduceus of Mercury, they fall a sleep on the Pedestal, and it sinks with them. Merc. Cease, Augusta! Cease thy mourning, Happy dayes appeare, Godlike Albion is returning Loyal Hearts to Cheere! Every Grace his youth Adorning, Glorious as the Star of Morning, Or the Planet of the Year. Chor. Godlike Albion is returning, &amp;c. Merc. to Arch. Hast away, Loyal chief, hast away. No delay, but obey: To receive thy lov'd Lord! hast away. [Ex. Arch. Tham. Medway and Isis, you that augment me, Tides that encrease my watry store, And you that are Friends to Peace and Plenty, Send my merry Boyes all ashore; Sea Men Skipping, Mariners Leaping, Shouting, Tripping, Send my merry Boyes all ashore! A Dance of Watermen in the King's and Duke's Liveries. The Clouds divide, and Juno appears in a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while a Symphony is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so Large, that it almost fills the opening of the Stage between Scene and Scene. Merc. The Clouds divide, what Wonders, What Wonders do I see! The Wife of Jove, 'Tis shee, That Thunders, More than thundring Hee! Juno. No, Hermes, No; 'Tis Peace above As 'tis below: For Jove has left his wandring Love. Tham. Great Queen of gathering Clouds; Whose Moisture fills our Floods, See; we fall before Thee, Prostrate wee adore Thee! Aug. Great Queen of Nuptial Rites, Whose pow'r the Souls Unites, And fills the Genial Bed with chast Delights, See; we fall before Thee Prostrate we adore Thee! Juno. 'Tis ratifi'd above by every God, And Jove has firm'd it with an Awfull Nod; That Albion shall his love renew: But oh, ungrateful Fair, Repeated Crimes beware, And to his Bed be true! Iris appears on a very large Machine. This was really seen the 18th of March 1684. by Capt. Christopher Gunman, on Board his R. H. Yacht, then in Calais Pierre: He drew it as it then appear'd, and gave a draught of it to us. We have only added the Cloud where the Person of Iris sits. Juno. Speak Iris, from Batavia, speak the Newes! Has she perform'd my dread Command, Returning Albion to his longing Land, Or dares the Nymph refuse? Iris. Albion, by the Nymph attended, Was to Neptune recommended, Peace and plenty spread the Sails: Venus in her shell before him, From the Sands in safety bore him, And supply'd Etesian gales. [Retornella Archon on the Shore Commanding, Lowly met him at his Landing, Crowd's of People swarm'd around; Welcome rang like Peals of Thunder; Welcome, rent the Skies assunder; Welcome, Heav'n and Earth resound. Juno. Why stay we then on Earth When Mortals laugh and love? Tis time to mount above And send AstrÃ¦a down, The Ruler of his Birth, And Guardian of his Crown. 'Tis time to mount above, And send AstrÃ¦a down. Mer., Ju., Ir. 'Tis time to mount above, And send AstrÃ¦a down. [Mer. Ju. and Iris ascend. Aug. and Tham. The Royal Squadron Marches, Erect Tryumphal Arches, For Albion and Albanius: Rejoyce at their returning, The passages adorning: The Royal Squadron marches, Erect Triumphal Arches For Albion and Albanius. Part of the Scene disappears, and the 4 Triumphal Arches erected at his Majesties Coronation are seen. Albion appears, Albanius by his side, preceded by Archon, followed by a Train, &amp;c. Full Chor. Hail, Royal Albion, Hail. Aug. Hail Royal Albion, Hail to thee, Thy longing Peoples expectation: Tham. Sent from the Gods to set us free. From Bondage and from Usurpation! Aug. To pardon and to pity me, And to forgive a guilty Nation! Tham. Behold the differing Climes agree. Rejoycing in thy Restauration. Entry; Representing the Four parts of the World, rejoycing at the Restauration of Albion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The Scene is a Poetical Hell. The Change is Total. The Upper part of the House, as well as the Side Scenes. There is the Figure of Prometheus chain'd to a Rock, the Vulture gnawing his Liver. Sisiphus rowling the Stone, the Belides, &amp;c. beyond, abundance of Figures in various Torments. Then a great Arch of Fire. Behind this Three Pyramids of Flames in perpetual agitation. Beyond this, glowing Fire which terminates the Prospect. Pluto, the Furies, with Alecto, Democracy and Zelota. Plut. Infernal Offspring of the Night, Debarr'd of Heav'n your Native right, And from the glorious Fields of Light, Condemn'd in shades to dragg the Chain, And fill with groans the gloomy Plain; Since Pleasures here are none below, Be ill our good, our joy be Woe; Our Work t'embroil the Worlds above, Disturb their Union, disunite their Love, And blast the Beautious frame of our Victorious Foe. Democ. and Zelot. together. Oh thou for whom those Worlds are made, Thou Sire of all things and their end, From hence they spring, and when they fade In Shuffled Heaps they hither tend; Here Humane Souls receive their Breath, And wait for Bodies after Death. Democ. Hear our Complaint and grant our Pray'r. Pluto. Speak what you are, And whence you fell? Democ. I am thy first begotten care, Conceiv'd in Heav'n; but born in Hell, When Thou didst bravely undertake in fight Yon Arbitrary Pow'r, That rules by Soveraign might, To set thy Heav'n-born fellows free And leave no difference in Degree, In that Auspicious Hour Was I begot by Thee. Zelota. One Mother bore us at a Birth, Her Name was Zeal before she fell; No fairer Nymph in Heav'n or Earth Till Saintship taught her to rebel: But loosing Fame And changing Name She's now the Good Old Cause in Hell. Plut. Dear Pledges of a Flame not yet forgot, Say, what on Earth has been your lot? Dem. and Zel. The Wealth of Albion's Isle was ours, Augusta stoopt with all her stately Towr's! Dem. Democracy kept Nobles under. Zel. Zeal from the Pulpit roar'd like Thunder. Dem. I trampled on the State. Zel. I lorded o're the Gown. Dem. and Zel. We both in Triumph sate Usurpers of the Crown. But oh Prodigious turn of Fate! Heaven controuling, Sent us rowling, rowling, down. Plut. I wonder'd how of late our Acherontique shore Grew thin, and Hell unpeople'd of her Store; Charon for want of Use forgot his Oar. The Souls of Bodies Dead flew all Sublime, And hither none return'd to purge a Crime: But now I see since Albion is restor'd, Death has no Bus'ness, nor the vengeful Sword. 'Tis too too much that here I ly From glorious Empire hurl'd; By Jove excluded from the Sky, By Albion from the World. Dem. Were Common-Wealth restor'd again, Thou should'st have Millions of the slain To fill thy dark abode. Zel. For He a Race of Rebels sends, And Zeal the Path of Heav'n pretends; But still mistakes the rode. Pluto. My lab'ring thought At length hath wrought A bravely bold design, In which you both shall joyn; In borrow'd shapes to Earth return; Thou Common-wealth, a Patriot seem, Thou Zeal, like true Religion burn, To gain the giddy Crowds Esteem. Alecto, thou to fair Augusta go, And all thy Snakes into her Bosom throw. Dem. Spare some to fling Where they may sting The Breast of Albion's King. Zel. Let Jealousies so well be mixt, That great Albanius be unfixt! Pluto. Forbear your vain Attempts, forbear; Hell can have no admittance there: The Peoples fear will serve as well, Make him suspected, them Rebel. Zel. Y'have all forgot To forge a Plot In seeming Care of Albion's Life; Inspire the Crowd With Clamours loud T'involve his Brother and his Wife. Alecto. Take of a Thousand Souls at thy Command, The basest, blackest of the Stygian band: One that will Swear to all they can invent, So throughly Damn'd that he can n'er repent: One often sent to Earth, And still at every Birth He took a deeper stain: One that in Adam's time was Cain: One that was burnt in Sodom's flame, For Crimes ev'n here too black to name: One, who through every form of ill has run: One who in Naboth's days was Belial's Son: One who has gain'd a Body fit for Sin; Where all his Crimes Of former Times Lie Crowded in a Skin. Pluto. Take him; Make him What you please; For He Can be A Rogue with ease. One for mighty Mischief Born: He can Swear and be Forsworn. Pluto and Alecto take him, &amp;c. Take him, make him what you please; For He can be a Rogue with ease. Pluto. Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh at our Woes, The Wretch that is damn'd has nothing to lose. Yee Furies advance With the Ghosts in a Dance, 'Tis a Jubilee here when the World is in trouble: When People rebel VVee frolick in Hell; A single Entry of a Devil follow'd by an Entry of 12 Devils. But when the King falls, the pleasure is double: Chorus. Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh at our VVoes, The VVretch that is damn'd hath nothing to lose. The Scene changes to a Prospect taken from the middle of the Thames; one side of it begins at York-Stairs, thence to VVhite-Hall, and the Mill-Bank, &amp;c. The other from the Saw-Mill, thence to the Bishop's Palace, and on as far as can be seen in a clear Day. Enter Augusta; She has a Snake in her Bosom, hanging down. Aug. O jealousy, Thou raging ill, Why hast thou found a Room in Lovers Hearts, Afflicting what thou can'st not kill, And Poysoning Love himself, with his own Darts? I find my Albion's Heart is gone, My first offences yet remain, Nor can repentance Love regain; One writ in Sand, alas, in Marble one. I rave, I rave, my Spirits boyl Like flames encreas'd and mounting high with pou'ring Oyl: Disdain and Love succeed by turns; One freezes me, and t'other burns; It burns. Away soft Love, Thou Foe to rest, Give Hate the full possession of my Breast. Hate is the nobler passion far VVhen Love is ill repay'd; For at one blow it ends the VVar, And Cures the Love-sick Maid. Enter Democracy and Zelota; one represents a Patriot, the other Religion. Dem. Let not thy generous passion wast its rage, But once again restore our golden Age; Still to weep and to complain, Does but more provoke disdain. Let publick good, Inflame thy Blood; VVith Crowds of VVarlike People thou art stor'd, And heaps of Gold; Reject thy old, And to thy Bed receive another Lord. Zel. Religion shall thy Bonds release, For Heav'n can loose, as well as tie all; And when 'tis for the Nations peace A King is but a King on Tryal; VVhen Love is lost, let Marriage end, And leave a Husband for a Friend. Dem. VVith Jealousy swarming The People are Arming And frights of oppression invade 'em. Zelot. If they fall to relenting, For fear of repenting, Religion shall help to perswade 'em. Aug. No more, no more Temptations use To bend my VVill; How hard a task 'tis to refuse A pleasing ill? Dem. Maintain the seeming duty of a VVife, A modest show will jealous Eyes deceive, Affect a fear for hated Albion's Life, And for imaginary Dangers grieve. Zelot. His Foes already stand protected, His Friends by publick Fame suspected, Albanius must forsake his Isle: A Plot Contriv'd in happy hour Bereaves him of his Royal Pow'r, For Heav'n to mourn and Hell to smile. The former Scene continues. Enter Albion and Albanius with a Train. [1.] Then Zeal and Common-wealth infest My Land again; The fumes of madness that possest The Peoples giddy Brain, Once more disturb the Nations rest, And dye Rebellion in a deeper Stain. 2. Will they at length awake the sleeping Sword, And force revenge from their offended Lord? How long, yee Gods, how long Can Royal patience bear Th'Insults and wrong Of Mad-mens jealousies, and causeless fear? 3. I thought their love by mildness might be gain'd, By Peace I was restor'd, in Peace I Reign'd: But Tumults, Seditions, And haughty Petitions, Are all the effects of a merciful Nature; Forgiving and granting, E're Mortals are wanting, But leads to Rebelling against their Creator. Mercury descends. Merc. With pity Jove beholds thy State, But Jove is circumscrib'd by Fate; Th'o'erwhelming Tide rowls on so fast, It gains upon this Islands wast: And is oppos'd too late! too late! Albion. What then must helpless Albion do? Merc. Delude the fury of the Foe, And to preserve Albanius, let him go; For 'tis decreed, Thy Land must bleed, For Crimes not thine, by wrathful Jove; A Sacred Flood of Royal Blood, Cries Vengeance, Vengeance lowd above. Mercury ascends. Albion. Shall I, t'asswage Their Brutal rage, The Regal stem destroy; Or must I lose, (To please my Foes,) My sole remaining joy? Yee God's what worse, What greater Curse, Can all your Wrath employ? Alban. Oh Albion! hear the Gods and me! Well, am I lost in saving Thee. Not exile or danger can fright a brave Spirit With Innocence guarded, With Vertue rewarded; I make of my sufferings a Merit. Albion. Since then the Gods, and Thou wilt have it so; Go: (can I live once more to bid Thee?) go, Where thy Misfortunes call Thee and thy Fate: Go, guiltless Victim of a guilty State, In War my Champion to defend, In peaceful Hours, when Souls unbend, My Brother, and what's more my Friend! Born where the Foamy Billows roar, On Seas less Dang'rous than the Shoar: Go, where the Gods thy Refuge have assign'd: Go from my sight; but never from my Mind. Alban. Whatever Hospitable ground shall be for me, unhappy Exile, found, Till Heav'n vouchsafe to smile; What Land so e're, Tho' none so dear, As this ungrateful Isle; O think! O think! no distance can remove My vow'd Allegiance, and my Loyal Love. Albion. and Alban. The Rosy finger'd Morn appears, And from her Mantle shakes her Tears, In promise of a glorious Day: The Sun, returning, Mortals chears, And drives the Rising Mists away, In promise of a glorious Day. [Ritornelle. The farther part of the Heaven opens and discovers a Machine; as it moves forwards the Clouds which are before it divide, and shew the Person of Apollo, holding the Reins in his hand. As they fall lower, the Horses appear with the Rays and a great glory about Apollo. Apoll. [1.] All Hail yee Royal pair! The God's peculiar care: Fear not the malice of your Foes; Their Dark designing And Combining, Time and truth shall once expose: Fear not the malice of your Foes. 2. My sacred Oracles assure, The Tempest shall not long indure; But when the Nations Crimes are purg'd away, Then shall you both in glory shine; Apollo goes forward out of sight. Propitious both, and both Divine: In Lustre equal to the God of Day. Neptune rises out of the Water, and a Train of Rivers, Tritons, and Sea Nymphs attend him. Thames, Old Father Ocean calls my Tyde: Come away, come away, The Barks upon the Billows ride, The Master will not stay; The merry Boson from his side, His Whistle takes to check and chide The lingring Lads delay, And all the Crew alowd has Cry'd, Come away, come away. See the God of Seas attends Thee, Nymphs Divine, a Beauteous Train: All the calmer gales befriend Thee In thy passage o're the Main: Every Maid her Locks is binding, Every Triton's Horn is winding, Welcome to the watry Plain. Chacon. Two Nymphs and Triton Sing. Yee Nymphs, the Charge is Royal, Which you must convey; Your Hearts and Hands employ all, Hasten to obey; When Earth is grown disloyal, Shew there's Honour in the Sea. The Chacon continues. The Chorus of Nymphs and Tritons repeat the same Verses. The Chacon continues. Two Nymphs and Tritons. Sports and Pleasures shall attend you Through all the Watry Plains, VVhere Neptune Reigns: Venus ready to defend you, And her Nymphs to ease your Pains. No storm shall offend you, Passing the Main; Nor Billow threat in vain, So Sacred a Train, Till the Gods that defend you, Restore you again. The Chacon continues. The Chorus repeat the same Verses, Sports and Pleasure. &amp;c. The Chacon continues. The two Nymphs and Triton Sing. See at your blest returning Rage disappears; The VVidow'd Isle in Mourning Dries up her Tears, VVith Flowers the Meads adorning, Pleasure appears, And love dispels the Nations causeless fears. The Chacon continues. The Chorus of Nymphs and Triton repeat the same Verses, See at your blest returning, &amp;c. The Chacon continues. Then the Chorus repeat, See the God of Seas, &amp;c. And this Chorus concludes the Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. The Scene is a view of Dover, taken from the Sea: a row of Cliffs fill up each side of the Stage, and the Sea the middle of it, which runs into the Peer: beyond the Peer, is the Town of Dover: on each side of the Town, is seen a very high Hill; on one of which is the Castle of Dover; on the other, the great Stone which they call the Devils drop. Behind the Town several Hills are seen at a great distance which finish the view. Enter Albion bareheaded: Acacia or Innocence with him. Albion. Behold yee Pow'rs! from VVhom I own A Birth immortal, and a Throne: See a Sacred King uncrown'd, See your Offspring, Albion, bound: The gifts you gave with lavish hand, Are all bestow'd in vain: Extended Empire on the Land, Unbounded o'er the Main. Acacia. Empire o'er the Land and Main, Heav'n that gave can take again; But a mind that's truly brave, Stands despising, Storms arising, And can ne'er be made a Slave. Albion. Unhelpt I am, who pity'd the distress'd, And none oppressing, am by all oppress'd; Betray'd, forsaken, and of hope bereft: Acacia. Yet still the Gods and Innocence are left. Albion. Ah! what canst thou avail, Against Rebellion arm'd with zeal, And fac'd with publick good? O Monarch's see Your Fate in me! To rule by Love, To shed no Blood, May be extol'd above; But here below, Let Princes know 'Tis fatal to be good. Chorus of both. To rule by Love &amp;c. Albion. But see! what prodigies are these? Acacia. Your Father Neptune from the Seas, Has Nereids and blew Triton's sent, To charm your discontent. Nereids rise out of the Sea and Sing, Tritons dance. [1.] From the low Palace of old Father Ocean, come we in pity your cares to deplore: Sea-raceing Dolphins are train'd for our Motion, Moony Tides swelling to rowl us a-shore, 2. Ev'ry Nymph of the flood, her Tresses rending, Throws of her Armlet of Pearl in the Main; Neptune in anguish his Charge unattending, Vessels are foundring, and Vows are in vain. Enter Tyranny, Democracy, represented by Men, attended by Asebia, Zelota, Women. Tyran. Ha, ha, 'tis what so long I wish'd and vow'd, Our Plots and delusions, Have wrought such confusions, That the Monarch's a Slave to the Crowd. Democ. A Design we fomented, Tyr. By Hell it was new! Dem. A false Plot invented, Tyr. To cover a true. Democ. First with promis'd faith we flatter'd, Tyr. Then jealousies and fears we scatter'd. Asebia. We never valu'd right and wrong, But as they serv'd our cause; Zelot. Our Business was to please the throng, And Court their wild applause: Asebia. For this we brib'd the Lawyers Tongue, And then destroy'd the Law's. Chor. For this, &amp;c. Tyran. To make him safe, we made his Friends our Prey; Dem. To make him great we scorn'd his Royal sway, Tyran. And to confirm his Crown, we took his Heir away. Dem. T'encrease his store, We kept him poor: Tyran. And when to wants we had betray'd him, To keep him low, Pronounc'd a Foe, Who e're presum'd to aid him. Asebia. But you forget the noblest part, And Masterpiece of all your Art, You told him he was sick at Heart. Zelot. And when you could not work belief In Albion of th'imagin'd grief; Your perjur'd vouchers in a Breath, Made Oath that he was sick to Death; And then five hundred Quacks of skill Resolv'd t'was fit he should be ill. Asebia. Now heigh for a Common-wealth, Wee merrily Drink and Sing, 'Tis to the Nations Health, For every Man's a King. Zelot. Then let the Masque begin, The Saints advance, To fill the Dance, And the Property Boys come in. The Boys in White begin a Fantastick Dance. Chor. Let the Saints ascend the Throne. Dem. Saints have Wives, and Wives have Preachers, Guifted men, and able Teachers; These to get, and those to own; Chor. Let the Saints ascend the Throne. Asebia. Freedom is a bait alluring; Them betraying, us securing, While to Sovereign pow'r we soar. Zelota. Old delusions new repeated, Shews 'em born but to be cheated, As their Fathers were before. Six Sectaries begin a formal affected Dance, the two gravest whisper the other Four, and draw 'em into the Plot: They pull out and deliver Libels to 'em, which they receive. Democr. See Friendless Albion there alone, Without Defence But Innocence; Albanius now is gone. Tyran. Say then, What must be done? Dem. The Gods have put him in our hand. Zelota. He must be slain! Tyran. But who shall then Command? Dem. The People: for the right returns to those, VVho did the trust impose. Tyran. 'Tis fit another Sun shou'd rise, To cheer the VVorld, and light the Skyes. Dem. But when the Sun, His race has run, And neither cheers the VVorld, nor lights the Skies; 'Tis fit a Common-wealth of Stars shou'd rise. Asebia. Each noble vice, Shall bear a Price, And Vertue shall a drug become: An empty Name VVas all her Fame, But now she shall be Dumb. Zelota. If open Vice be what you drive at, A Name so broad we'll ne'er connive at. Saints love Vice, but more refin'dly, Keep her close, and use her kindly. Tyran. Fall on. Dem. Fall on: Ere Albion's death we'll try, If one or many shall his room supply. The white Boys dance about the Saints: The Saints draw out the Association, and offer it to 'em: They refuse it and quarrel about it: Then the white Boys and Saints fall into a confus'd Dance, imitating fighting: The white Boys at the end of the Dance, being driven out by the Sectaries with Protestant Flails. Albion. See the Gods my cause defending, VVhen all humane help was past! Acacia. Factions mutually contending, By each other fall at last. Albion. But is not yonder Proteus Cave, Below that steep, Which rising Billows brave? Acacia. It is: And in it lies the God asleep: And snorting by, We may descry, The Monsters of the deep. Albion. He knows the past, And can resolve the future too. Acacia. 'Tis true! But hold him fast, For he can change his hew. The Cave of Proteus rises out of the Sea, it consists of several Arches of Rock work, adorn'd with mother of Pearl, Coral, and abundance of Shells of various kinds: Thro' the Arches is seen the Sea, and parts of Dover Peer: In the middle of the Cave is Proteus a sleep on a Rock adorn'd with Shells, &amp;c. Like the Cave. Albion and Acacia seize on him, and while a Symphony is playing, he sinks as they are bringing him forward, and changes himself into a Lyon, a Crocodile, a Dragon, and then to his own shape again: He comes toward the front of the Stage, and Sings. Symphony. Proteus. [1] Albion, lov'd of Gods and Men, Prince of Peace too mildly Reigning, Cease thy sorrow and complaining; Thou shalt be restor'd agen: Albion, lov'd of Gods and Men. 2. Still thou art the care of Heav'n, In thy Youth to Exile driv'n: Heav'n thy ruin then prevented, Till the guilty Land repented: In thy Age, when none could aid Thee, Foes conspir'd, and Friends betray'd Thee; To the brink of danger driv'n, Still thou art the Care of Heav'n. Albion. To whom shall I my preservation owe? Proteus. Ask me no more! for 'tis by Neptune's Foe. Proteus descends. Democracy and Zelota return with their Faction. Democ. Our seeming Friends, who joyn'd alone, To pull down one, and build another Throne, Are all disperst and gone: We brave republick Souls remain. Zelot. And 'tis by us that Albion must be Slain: Say, whom shall wee employ The Tyrant to destroy? Democ. That Archer is by Fate design'd, With one Eye clear, and t'other blind. Zelota. He seems inspir'd to do't. Omnes. Shoot Holy Cyclop, shoot. The one Ey'd Archer advances, the rest follow: A fire arises betwixt them and Albion. [Ritornel. Democ. Lo! Heav'n and Earth combine, To blast our bold design. What Miracles are shown? Nature's alarm'd, And Fires are arm'd, To guard the Sacred Throne. Zelota. What help, when jarring Elements conspire To punish our audacious Crimes. Retreat betimes, To shun th'avenging Fire. Chor. To shun the avenging Fire. [Ritor. As they are going back a Fire arises from behind: They all sink together. Albion. Let our tuneful accents upwards move, Till they reach the vaulted Arch of those above; Let us adore 'em; Let us fall before 'em: Acacia. Kings they made, and Kings they love When they protect a rightful Monarch's Reign, The Gods in Heav'n, the Gods on Earth maintain. Both. When they protect, &amp;c. Albion. But see what glories guild the main. Acacia. Bright Venus brings Albanius back again, With all the loves and graces in her train. A Machine rises out of the Sea: It opens and discovers Venus, and Albanius sitting in a great Scallop-shell, richly adorn'd: Venus is attended by the Loves and Graces, Albanius by Hero's: The Shell is drawn by Dolphins: It moves forward, while a Simphony of Fluts-Doux, &amp;c. is playing till it Lands 'em on the Stage, and then it closes and sinks. Venus Sings. Albion, Hail; The Gods present Thee, All the richest of their Treasures, Peace and Pleasures, To content Thee, Dancing their eternal measures: Graces and Loves, Dance an Entry. Venus. But above all humane blessing; Take a Warlike Loyal Brother, Never Prince had such another: Conduct, Courage, truth expressing, All Heroick worth possessing. Here the Hero's Dance is perform'd. Chor. of all. But above all, &amp;c. [Ritor. Whilst a Simphony is playing; a very large, and a very glorious Machine descends: The figure of it Oval, all the Clouds shining with Gold, abundance of Angels and Cherubins flying about 'em, and playing in 'em; in the midst of it sits Apollo on a Throne of Gold: he comes from the Machine to Albion. PhÅb. From Jove's Imperial Court, Where all the Gods resort; In awful Council met, Surprizing news I bear: Albion the Great, Must change his Seat, For Hee's adopted there. Ven. What Stars above shall we displace? Where shall he fill a Room Divine? Nept. Descended from the Sea Gods Race, Let him by my Orion shine. PhÅb. No, Not by that tempestuous sign: Betwixt the Balance and the Maid, The Just, August, And peaceful shade, Shall shine in Heav'n with Beams display'd, While great Albanius is on Earth obey'd: Ven. Albanius Lord of Land and Main, Shall with fraternal vertues Reign; And add his own, To fill the Throne; Ador'd and fear'd, and lov'd no less: In VVar Victorious, mild in Peace, The joy of men, and Jove's increase. Acacia. O Thou! Who mount'st th'Ãthereal Throne, Be kind and happy to thy own; Now Albion is come, The People of the Sky, Run gazing and Cry, Make Room, make Room, Make room for our new Deity. Here Albion mounts the Machine, which moves upward slowly. A full Chorus of all that Acacia sung. Ven. Behold what Triumphs are prepar'd to grace Thy glorious Race, Where Love and Honour claim an equal place; Already are they fixt by Fate, And only ripening Ages wait. The Scene changes to a walk of very high Trees: At the end of the Walk is a view of that part of Windsor, which faces Eaton: In the midst of it is a row of small Trees, which lead to the Castle-hill: In the first Scene, part of the Town and part of the Hill: In the next the Terrace Walk, the King's Lodgings, and the upper part of St. George's Chappel, then the Keep; and lastly, that part of the Castle, beyond the Keep. In the Air is a Vision of the Honors of the Garter; the Knights in Procession, and the King under a Canopy: Beyond this, the upper end of St. George's Hall. Fame rises out of the middle of the Stage, standing on a Globe; on which is the Arms of England: The Globe rests on a Pedestal: On the Front of the Pedestal is drawn a Man with a long, lean, pale. Face, with Fiends Wings, and Snakes twisted round his Body: He is incompast by several Phanatical Rebellious Heads, who suck poyson from him, which runs out of a Tap in his Side. Fame. Renown, assume thy Trumpet! From Pole to Pole resounding: Great Albion's Name; Great Albion's Name shall be The Theme of Fame, shall be great Albion's Name, Great Albion's Name, Great Albion's Name. Record the Garters glory: A Badge for Hero's, and for Kings to bear: For Kings to bear! And swell th'Immortal Story, With Songs of Gods, and fit for Gods to hear; And swell th'Immortal Story, VVith Songs of Gods, and fit for Gods to hear; For Gods to hear. A full Chorus of all the Voices and Instruments: Trumpets and Ho-Boys make Returnello's of all Fame sings; and Twenty four Dancers joyn all the time in a Chorus, and Dance to the end of the Opera.
