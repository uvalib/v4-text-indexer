      <field name="fulltext">To R. A. M. S. I dedicate this play Worthier had been this offering of thee, Clad in the fancied colours that it wore, Whilst it was still a glorious dream to be Hereafter carried forthâa hope before, And not the fragments, thin and ill-combined, Of an unremedied defeat behind. Worthier had been this offering of theeâ A fairer garland for a nobler browâ Had'st thou agreed to share the work with me, And been co-author and not critic now: Therefore, if aught is bad, the blame is thine: Remember that, and spare me, critic mine. Such as it is, to thee I offer it, The worthiest offering that I could make, A pledge of friendship of itself unfit: Not for it's own, but for its author's sake, Accept this now; and let me hope again To dedicate to thee some nobler strain.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act The First. Lady Henrietta Wentworth. (Scene: a neglected room in an old house on the Thames, London.) I. Henrietta. Is this the way my dreary life shall end, In sorrow heaped on sorrow, woe on woe? How have I sinned that God should plague me thus? I am perplexed and puzzled. If we sinned, When we had prayed to God to show us how We were awrong, why did no voice reply, Why was no answer giv'n? Or, if 'twas right Why do I doubt and struggle in my mind, Attacking and defending, putting forth All subtleties of word and argument On this side and on that? The very house Preaches all day to mine unwilling ears. I do not knowâI cannot somehow think That all these woes were sent on me for naught. Those eighteen men, indeed, on whom the tower Brought thunderous death, while God was still on earthâ Wellâit was true enough for them perhaps; But not for me: I see that clear enough. Those very drops, that in the recent rains, Fell, with a long splash from the leaky roof And rankled by my bedside, in a pool And, like an acid, ate the rotten floorâ Those very drops were accusations. Still, I do not understand it, cannot see How all these things should come upon me so For something God was asked to speak about. I asked him purely, meant to take his will, And, by whatever struggle, make it mine. Is God so careless of the souls of men? How easy had it been for him to speak? I waitedâwaitedâprayed and searched in vain. That very morning, ere the dew was dry, I stole across the coppice to the park; And there I watched the streamlet's little pool: A turn it takesâthe little rivuletâ Splashing, in tiny thunder, on the stones, And pouring summer cataracts of spray Down pigmy, moss-grown, water-hollowed cliffs: Then, on the pool below, 'mong rush and sedge And fresh green forests of the meadow grass, Float bubbles on its surface. There I stopped, And searching there for omens in the brook As in the wind blown leaves and all things else, I fell to counting bubbles. One and two, And so on up to sev'n and then to eight; But niether nine to ten. Two bubbles! Aye, If I am wrong, God let me drift to sin For want of such a thing? Can this be true? Were two mens-souls not worth two globes of air, Sealed up in rain-bow domes of water? Still, I cannot grow at ease about this thing. Was I in earnest seeking for the sign? Did I not see one and refuse to see? Perhaps it was so. Only can this be? Can one tell lies to cheat oneself withal? I do not, cannotâthere is something wrongâ I leave this to philosophers and priests. All I can feel is Monmouth's deadly peril. O God! if it was my fault, pardon him! I bear the blame of it: I urged him on. Thou wilt not slay him? Lord, he thought it right: Thou hads't deceived himâI, I mean, had done't. O this is impious to doubt the Lord. It cannot be that we have sinned in this: It is accusing God. And yet, his wifeâ I cannot pass by that: it is too hard. O how she must have wept and pined alone. She must have love'd him, could not choose but love; And yet, methinks, if she had loved him much He had not left her for the first fair face And plunged into the sin I took him from. Could that be evil which so bettered him? And then we prayed to thee. But what do I, Thus grieving selfishly on selfish griefs? She suffers too and suffers worse than Iâ She, robbed of him and left alone to pine. I think I will go forth and visit her, And pray her to forgive me all my wrong, And we could weep together. Wherefore not? Both love him and the axe is o'er his neck: Is that a time for petty jealousies? Tis well enough for me who dealt the blow And reaped a life-time's pleasure from her grief To act forgiveness; but for her?âI fear That she would drive me forth with scorn and wrath: I think I know what name she gives to me. And has she not a right to hate me sore? Ah! what a bitter life must hers have been! And it was I who robbed and stripped that life Of all the gilding love would paint it with, And left her lonely, loveless, scorned by all, To learn how weak was heâand I, how bad. O it was sinful! But the prayer, the prayer! God would have answered us had it been wrong: God must have answered us! But here comes Jerome, lately Monmouth's groom. What further news can he have brought me? Nayâ I will not think it is a pardon yet Lest disappointment come to blast my joy. II. Martha, Jerome. Martha. Aye, is it so indeed? he begged his life? Jerome. Nay, worse than that. He sprawled upon the ground, Kissed James's feet and piteously wept, Offered to change his faith and join the ranks Of scarlet Babylon. All men are wroth. Martha. But, hark ye, Jerome, when you told it her, How did she bear it? Was she not aghast? Did she not faint? Or weep aloud? Jerome. Not she. She turned as pale and stately as a man Hard-stricken to the heart; but that was all. Stay, here she comes. (As Henrietta enters, exit Jerome.) Henrietta. Come here, good Martha. So: now sit we down. Martha. Is not the morning lovely, Lady, look, Do you recallâ Henrietta. I neither see nor wish. As I came in, I saw old Jerome go. What was he saying to you, Martha? What? You will not answer? Ah, you blush, my child. What pretty hair you haveâas soft as silk: So, let me smooth it. He was telling you That Monmouth prayed his life? Martha. My Lady, yes. Henrietta. And what thought you of all he told you, then? Martha. I thought that James must be a cruel King Not to have pardoned him upon the spot; But that, for certain, he was not so bad As let his nephew dieâso fair a man. Henrietta. Nay girl, that is not what I mean: I ask, Not what you thought of the usurper James, But what you thought of Monmouth. Speak you not? You do not wish to speak: you judge him hard. Martha. God knows, my ladyâ Henrietta. Aye; and I know too: I know, and God, that you think ill of him. But hearken child, and I will tell you all And show you wherefore he did this and that And why you should not blame him. 'Twas not fear That made him beg ignoble life from James: It was for me he did it. Ere he left, I said to him, a-thinking in my heart That he might be incautious in the fight Or risk untimely capture from stray horse, That I had driven him onward to this deed, And added: âTherefore for my sake, my love, Be not too rash and see and save thy life, Lest I should hold me guilty of your blood.â Martha. How could my lady think of such a thing? 'Twas he, not you, that had a throne to gain: 'Twas he, not you, that fixed upon the deed. Henrietta. But then he thought that I would think, my childâ Martha. More shame to him to have such evil thoughts! Henrietta. But, Martha, I had told him so myself. Martha. True; yet I thinkâ Henrietta (vehementer.) And who cares what you think? What right have you to cast a meddling word, And drop more gall into a bitter cup? Martha. I did but answer when my lady asked. Henrietta. Aye; so you did. Forgive me then, good lass; For I am vexed and peevish; and a seed, Beneath a heap of beds, would drive me mad, So sharp and captious have I grown of late. But you are silly, child: you do not see That it was noble in him, so to act, Not mean and cowardly, but great of heart And full of kindly complaisance for me. Do you not see? You kiss my hand: ah well! I take your answer. Now go forth, my child: Help Jerome with the housework: leave me here. (Exit Martha.) Thank Heaven she is gone! I cannot play So intricate a part, nor feign to love Deeds I can only sneer upon and hate. O Monmouth! Monmouth! could it be indeed That it was you who grovelled for your life? Like mincing Agag, tripping to the King: âSurely the bitterness of death is passed.â But I can pardon Monmouth that: for me, For his great love, to save me greater woe, He begged dishonoured life from cruel James. Aye, I can pardon that: the other count Was blacker; for she went to visit himâ His injured wife, the wife that he had leftâ She went, forgiveness in her heart, to him Who had embittered all her weary life; And what did he? So cold, so icy cold! How could he treat her so, how turn his back And shoulder her aside as he has done, Coarsely unmindful of the pain he gave? Ah! what must she have suffered standing there! I do believe, had it been I he scorned, My heart had broke within me at his words. And I had fall'n before him, at his feet. Small hearts, I know, when they have injured once, For very shame go on to injure more; But Monmouth's heart was noble: noble hearts In such abaisements find their highest pride, And know that the admission of a fault Wipes half the crime away. I fear that this same guilty love of ours Has eaten good things from his heart and left A windy void, for evil love and fear To wrestle in and drive the man about Like staggering vessels under veering gusts That blow, and shift, and pause, and blow again And whip white spray upon the plunging decks. And yet the prayer, the prayer! 'Tis always so: The knotted fabric of my dusky dreams Is always streaked with that sad prayer of mine, As with a thread of fire. It seems to me That I should find an answer even yet. Lo! I will try the old divining trick And ope the bible at hap-hazardâAh! The answer has arrived! Did we suppose That God would rend the knitted arch of sky And thunder trumpet-words for such as us? The answer has been spoken ages back: For us, it lurked in dusty manuscripts Pent in some worm-gnawn convent libraryâ To gather novel force and breathe again, As if with second life, to crush our dreams. Our Lord himself has answered our demand: âThe wicked and adulterous seek a sign.â O Lord, we sought one and Thou hast not sent! If he es-capes, I have made up my mind: I shall not see him more: this evil love, Guilty and criminal, has gnawed the life From all the manhood of a noble soulâ Is that not sign enough to flee from him? How has it's pleasure turned to woe and pain And the sharp sting of many a bitter blush! (Enter Michael Lambourne.) Ah! you are welcome, Master Lambourne. News? Not, let me trust, such evil tales as last: Thank God, at least, there is no worse than worst! Lambourne. No, madam: still we trust that all is well. Henrietta. I fear that you but trifle with my woe From some mistaken kindness. Hear me now: Speak out whatever doubts or fears you have And do not teach me into empty hopes, Like some mad flow'ret, lured by southern winds, To blossom forth before the snows are gone. O think, good Master Lambourne, think awhile And do not hurry into empty words. I tell you, sir, if he be slain, for me There is no refuge nearer than the tomb. Lambourne. MadamâI cannot tell you how I feelâ IâIâmy heart is sore to hear you thus! Henrietta. No: do not spare me now whilst I am strong. And let the whole weight fall on me at once. Speak out, I pray you. Lambourne. Sure as I am here, And God beholds us, Monmouth will escape. This is no idle word to save you grief: I speak as I believeânay, as I know. Henrietta. What! you are certain Monmouth will escape! Lambourne. Can I say more than I have said? Henrietta. Ah me! If this be so, it clearly proves me wrong: God would not bless the vicious thus, I think. Lambourne. I beg your pardon? Surely you remarked? Henrietta. My mind was wandering: I am now so glad That all the tissue of unwholesome doubt That gathered, cobweb-like, about my soul Have melted off. You do not think, do you, That God can help the wicked? Lambourne. Job would seemâ Henrietta. Stay now I think me, I am wrong perhaps. What do you mean by âMonmouth will escape?â He will not beâemprisoned? eh?âfor life? You will not say so? O that changes all! Lambourne. He will be sitting by you here, I hope Before the next day's sun is down, unlessâ Henrietta. O thank you sir! How light you make my heart! But what does that meanâmonitor âunlessâ? Lambourne. Nay, something that will make you gladder still. You know how sadly you complained to me And to the other gentlemen you saw Of the unwholesome lodgement giv'n you here? Well, we have found another: we have found A grand old house some twenty miles from this: A house beside a river, where long meads Fruit heavy grass among the rippleing waves And just flower loaded headlands in the stream: Between the house and stream, a narrow belt, Lies a bright garden, flanked on either hand [Henrietta] I must be gone and get me ready sir. Lambourne. Stay for one moment, madamâonly stay. Henrietta. More business still? You are exigeant, sir; So 'tis with most folk: give them but the inch; And straightway they demand the ell of right. Lambourne. 'Tis scarce on business this timeâonlyâIâ Henrietta. Why do you stop and hesitate? Speak out: I shall not blame you for a clumsy speech. Take heart, sir; and whatever you may want, Believe me, my best services are yours. Lambourne. Only, my LadyâI amâI shall notâ I shall not see you any more. Henrietta. A very awful subject of complaint! But I am sorry, sir: you have been kind I hope 'tis not your complaisance for us That makes the land too hot for you to stay. Is it a journey you are going on? Lambourne. The longest, lady. Henrietta. What, are you unwell? I feared before that you were not aright. It is a shame to keep you standing here. Go home, and if you want, in coin or work Or anything my grattitude can give, Believe me it is yours. I think I heard You had a widdowed mother still alive? Go home: bethink you, you have her to keep. Lambourne. I thank you, Lady: you are kindness' self. But IâI almost thoughtâI have forgotâ Save there is something I forgot to tell! Henrietta. It must stand over: do not grieve for that. Lambourne. Good day. (Goes to the door, pauses and then returns.) Is there not something I have left behind? Ah no! Tis nothing. Lady fare thee well! (Exit. Henrietta. With what a tragic air our scriv'ner spake! And how he looked! His eyes pursue me still: He looked so sadly, fixedly on me. As though he sought to learn my face by heart And make a stealthy portrait some time else. And then he is so like to Monmouth: half, I doubt if I could see the twain at once And label each one rightly. How is this? My glove?âmy glove? Why he has ta'en my glove! (End of Act The First.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act The Second. Michael Lambourne. I. (The garret of a house on the outskirts of London: a boxbed in one corner. A table, heaped with papers, is drawn near the fire. Night.) Michael Lambourne. All the hot fancies of a fervid brain, All the great efforts of a youthful hope, All that I thought to render to the world, All that I hoped would blazon forth my name And make me one for all posterityâ Let it all go!âI have no further hope. I give my life to buy the further shame, To render sure the further sin of one, The only one I love. What need of these? Why leave a turgid, undigested mass Of crude materials and half-grown thoughts? How could they add a lustre to my name? They could not: had I lived another year, I might have done what would have made me great; But now I go to die. Into the flame, Into the flame with all my boyish hopes! (A pause.) Did Jephtha's daughter, on the Gilead hills, Think, as with ring of feet and full voiced chant She and her maidens spent the waiting month, How lowland reapers in their toil would pause And hear her voice and marvel at her strength? Or how the maiden in love with upland farm, Hearing the death-song cleave the spectral night, Would creep to open lattice and behold, With love and stealing of her youthful heart, The long white garments flashing in the moon Across the bold and rugged Gilead heights? Did Curtius, ere he took the misty leap, Glow in his heart, with sudden rush of blood, To think how Rome looked on him wondering, To recollect that one, white-armÃ¨d girl, Breathless and panting, watched him from the crowd, Her whole soul bound in his? The martyrs, too, Beside keen flickers of destroying fire, Or looking on the wan, worn axe, perhaps Thought just a little how posterity Would love and honour and embalm their names. I feel it so, at least: I could not die, If Henrietta did not know of it And thank me even with a single tear. O! I shall make her think of me at last And know I loved and gave a life for her! And yet 'twere noblerâaye, an hundredfoldâ To die in silence, to defy two deaths: Death of the body, death of earthly fame. Why should I mar the pureness of my gift By culling roses ready for my crown? Why should I let her know at what expense Her love was bought for her? Ah! she would weep! And yet if I am giving up my life, Why should I get no recompense of hope? What less do I deserve to gild my death Than certain hope that she will hear my deed? I could not die unheard: I could not die, Her thinking me a lackey over-rude; For sure she must have noticed how I spoke And dared not leave her presence, take my eyes For the last time, from off her glorious face; And then the gloveâshe must have missed the glove. Argue no more: I cannot die unheard. I must write something to my lady once That she may think of me when I am gone. I'll tell her how I loved her, how I longed, The last time I should see her living face, To bare my burning breastful to her heart And own my love that she might pardon it. I'll tell her that I die for her, not him: That I consider me the better man And one more fitted to bring on the birth Of what there may beâif aught worth there isâ Still hidden in the stormy womb of time. I'll ask her too to pardon me the lie With which I cheated her to write to him, And pray her solemnly to see that nought Be wanting to my mother's waning age. (A pause: he writes.) Lo: it is doneâmy first one and my lastâ My earliest love-confession, yet my will. To think she can not read it ere the end, Till body and soul are severed and undone And all the purpled saw-dust oozes through With what now pulses at my heart and brow. I am not cheated: it is hard to die. God welded soul and body into one, Which, not without some trouble, men divide. (A pause.) O God! am I aright in doing this? Is life one's own that one may fling it down? And do I not deceive myself to death? There is a glamour in uncommon deeds, A spurious halo of heroic buff, That cheats one into things he would repent. What claim has she, with all her glorious face, To take my mother's place in all my thoughts? Poor mother! Am I right to leave you thus?â You who have borne me, loved me, love me still, To leave you lonely in this bitter world Gnawing the crust of arid beggary, Because this haughty demozel is fair And rustled down a darkened corridor, With greenish glimmers playing here and there Upon the changeful texture of her dress? I wonder, had she worne a diffr'ent silk And not shone so to me on that first day Should I have lovedâshould I be set for death? And is it thus, O mother, I depart? Because the painted dame donned lucent silks, That glimmered still from oriental suns And still breathed foreign perfumes, wierd and strangeâ Is it for this I leave you, mother dear? Can this be right? and yet can this be wrong? Is it not strange? Now Justice tells one: âliveâ; And it is interest bids me answer: âdieâ. Is it the case I die to please myself, To throw a larger shadow on her mind. As further objects do, between the light; And do not offer up my life and heart And all I wish for, all I hoped to be, Upon the thorny altar of my love? If we could but believe our hearts! (A pause.) In vain! I write the letter telling her of this. (A pause: he writes.) The weary night is surely over now. (Draws aside the blind. Yes, in the east the faint new day is born And broadens on the sky. Already, see, The light must be approaching our old house Upon the purple hill, above the firth; And he, that lives in't now, will see The new day walking on the morning waves, With wandering squalls and tags of rugged mist And streaks of wind-blown rain beside the west, Chased back before the white-heat line of dawn. To wake my mother or to let her sleep? One thing is sure: I must be going soon, Lest people mark my bearing on the street. Ha! see how we impute our thoughts to all! Since all the world seems changed to me, I think I must seem changed to all the world in turn. Am I not taller? Yesternight I stooped, And now I belly forth a martial chest, And look the liker him I have to act. O! O! my mother! must I leave you thus? My darling motherâthusâwithout a word? Ah Henrietta, know you what you do? My God, my God I fear my strength will fail! What? weeping? Ah I must begone at once. Adieu my mother! God preserve you, dear, Since I am base enough to fail my trust! âStay! I would look upon her once againâ Or hear her breathing even! Hark! she stirs. God bless you mother, and forgive your son. II. (A Room in the Tower of London.) Monmouth, Lambourne. Monmouth. I thank you kindly for this visit, friend: I thank you kindly. Wherefore do you wear A false red beard, a patch upon your eye And a grey wig above an youthful face? Lambourne. Of that anon, Lord Duke. At present tell How all things fare with you. Monmouth. Things fare with me? How should they fare with one condemned to death? All night, I cling at the rough bars and wake: Alternate, comes a burst of pallid moon And a long lash of bitter, blinding rain That beats upon me through the glassless space. All day the sameâfour walls, four walls, four walls, A grated window and a bolted door, A flag-lined pavement where the eddying dust Whirls in the gusty draughts from ev'ry chinkâ And death before! I hear the steady tramp Of yon black loon that watches there without: I hear the breathless whirring of time's wings From the great clock beside the turret-peak: I hear the rain drip steadily in the court: I hear a thousand echoes howling death. O Lambourne! tis a frightful, ghastly thought! Waiting for death, living for death! No end, No issue but the tomb. Indeed my God, Indeed I cannot bear it! Lambourne. What my Lord? Had it been I, thin blooded scrivener, That said such words, the marvel had been none, But youâyou who in both your fights have fought As valliantly as men could ask of you, As valliantly as Stuart blood required? Monmouth. In fight? Ah yes! who would not die in fight? Long squadrons circle, closing on the foot: Through sulphurous smoke the gleaming sabre cleaves: And all the battle rings and flashes out, A merry cadence, full of steely daring And long, loud, warlike trumpet-blares: An instrument, a fighting artifice, No more a living, thinking man, you charge And lash the whistling air with gleaming cuts. Besides, sir, there is one great point therein: In battle, no man thinks he will be killed: A on his right, B on his left may fall; But he, he feels, will sweep athwart the fight, As woundless as Achilles. Whereas, here, I am so certain that I am to die That I can name to you the very hours, Minutes and seconds that I have to live. And I lie here, inactive, waiting death! O Lambourne! Lambourne! it is agony! You do not know how nearly mad I am; Or, how I long to dash my weary life, With one great blow, against the solid wall! You talk of bravery: what is bravery here? What can I do? But give me here a sword, And I will cut a desperate, bloody way And burst the fetters of this cattif fear. But what can courage do in here? To wait, See, drawing nearer, the grim hour of death, And perish slowly, healthy all the time. Bravery is active. Lambourne. What of courage, then? Courage methinks was made to suffer all; While bravery holds the merry, windy van Where clarions nerve it for a bright-eyed death. But still there is a great excuse for you: This gloomy cell would drive a pope to prayers. Had you been out with me my Lord, and seen The house where Lady Wentworth is to liveâ A rare old house, an excellent old house. It was so hot too: all the land was rolled In slumbrous heat: the very air had grown So lazy with the warmth that it performed It's tasks but ill and brought the hills to me All blurred and mazy with it's carelessness. But down beside the riverâ Monmouth. There! enough. I was not there to see the sight with you, And never more shall look upon such things: It pains me sadly but to hear of them. Lambourne. And yet, Lord Duke, the Lady Wentworth there Proposes to make stay; and with her face To paint and render human all the house, 'Twill be the sweetest mansion in the world. Monmouth. How often must I ask you, sir, to cease? Do you not see you lacerate my heart? Have you no pity for my dreary days, That you should make them blacker by contrast With happy houses and long hours of hope? Why should you thus torment me: never more Shall fruitful summer don her leaves for me. Lambourne. What makes my Lord Duke say such cruel words? Monmouth. It needs no prophet, that to prophecy. Lambourne. I am a better prophet than my Lord. My Lord has slopes of happy years to run. Monmouth. You mean that James will pardon me? Alas! If that's my only hope, Despair as soon! Lambourne. Nor even that, though that were sure enough. Hearken to me, Lord Duke: Why should your life, Your life that's worth so much to all of us, Be given to stay the gluttony of James? Are there no other men, that for the ring Of windy words, to make a worthy end, Your life should go? IâI myself my Lordâ I that now speak to youâwhat worth is mine? How would men miss me were mine ending made? The world would go as easily and well, If I were dead; but then, my Lord, if youâ Monmouth. Upon your life, no more! Am I so base, So sadly fall'n and damaged in your eyes, That you insult me thus? Am I so vile, So worthless that I am not fit to die?â So cowardly that some one else must give A better life to save my neck awhile From the short discipline of shearing glaive? I'll hear no more of this, sirâtrust me that! Do not mistake my meaning: I am glad, Aye truly glad, to know I have a friend So noble and devoted as to give His life for mine; but now, no more of it. Lambourne. What means this rhapsody, Lord Duke? King James Is almost sure to pardon: it is not A life I give to save my monarch's life: 'Tis but my freedom that I pawn awhile, With a dim chance of death, to let you go And gather troops and monies to assist In my escape? Were you, my Lord, to stay And be immured in some dark prison-vault, Who has an influence to move the mob, Who power to charter and to arm enough To set you free? Whereas if I am left, A month or two I rot on mouldy straw: Then comes King Monmouth with another band, By old misfortune led to new success; And I shall place the crown upon his head In token of my services to him, While trumpets blow and ring aloud to us, And London is a-tip toe for my Lord. Monmouth. No more of it: your scheme, perchance, is goodâ It mightâit isâI mean it is, at least, Well thought and worthy of a trial now Were't not 'twould be a shame to let a man So gallant, perish for so sad a Duke. Lambourne. I seem more noble to my Lord, perhaps, Than is the case. What cause have I to love, What reason to give liberty for you? You never did me services; and I Have had no means to learn your inmost heart; And loyalty, methinks, is nearly done, A flickering candle, blown by sudden draughts That soon will cease. But what am I indeed? I, a poor scrivener, scrivening for my bread, I play my life, as many a soldier plays, Against your grattitude in future days, A full annuity, an idle age, Perchance a title to bequeath my sons, And fame to guild my race for many a year. Monmouth. You paint yourself too black: no more of this. Lambourne. And then, my Lord, what right have you to leave The Lords and barons and the peasantry Who fought to set you on your father's throne? For them, as for yourself, as for her sakeâ Her's, who has made your life a joy to youâ It is your duty to go forth this day. Monmouth. I'll hear no more of this. Have done, good sir. Lambourne. Aye, for her sake, if there were no one else. Ah, my dear Lord, your life is not your own: Your life is hers; for he who is beloved Has nothing single: thoughts and words and deeds, Which, in another, would be selfishness, Are raised in him above the mire of self And, doubly blessing, are made doubly blest. How far from me that am but half a manâ A glass that strangely glasses but itselfâ Most selfish in the hour of sacrifice! I say again my Lord, your life's not yours: There is another that requires your life: Your death another word for hers, your life Her real existence. O my Lord, I saw The face grow pale, the breath stop half-way-drawn, The tear drops forming in the violet eyeâ But let me speak no more: I see how much My words are hurting you: take this and read. (Gives Henrietta's letter. Monmouth. What! she entice me to this shameful plan? Lambourne. Read on, Lord Duke: you see it is her hand. Monmouth. I see. She wishesâlongs to have me free. But I, sir, can I leave you here to die? Some one more noble than myself to die? Lambourne. Die, my Lord? Why what say you now? The other minute, were we not agreed That James was sure to spare your life? Monmouth. Were we? I thoughtâI had forgotten I had used the words. It might perhaps be well, viewing the thing In that way, to agree to this. 'Odslife! If 'twere not for the cowardice, I thinkâ Lambourne. The cowardice, Lord Duke? I rede you not. 'Twere cowardice alone if you should stay. It is your duty to your noble friends, Your duty to your fathers murdered blood, Your duty to yourself, to hie you forth And raise again your banner. If you stay Meanly awaiting mean captivity, For fear that men should think too harsh of thee, That were the cowardice and nothing else. Monmouth. Almost you do persuade meâ Lambourne. Hearken now, I tell you plainly, if you do not flee, There's one will die of it whom you love well: Already she is paler, thinner, pinched, Drawn in a little, like a man who waits Wrapped up in expectation. She will die; And you will be her murderer my Lord. Monmouth. Wellâno, I thinkâYes, damn the thing, come on. Tear off your clothes: give me the beard and wig: Thereânow the patch: I thank youâit is done. Lambourne. Ah! now Lord Duke, now is their something done! I like that burst of hearty energy. Take you this letter to your Lady fair, And give it her when first you see her face. Now Master Lambourne fare you well today: I am beholden for this visit, sir: Good-b'ye! To nineteen Irish Street, Duke! Monmouth. What have I done? Take off the clothes again: take back thy wig: I'll have no more on't. 'Tis a scurvy joke! Take off the clothes, best friend I ever had, Be you, once more, the writer, I the duke. Lambourne. I am the Duke now. Purchased with my life, I prize my dignity fair scriv'ner. Go! The Duke commands. Monmouth. Nay, I am not so base: I know too well James will not pardon me. Take off the clothes again and let me die. Lambourne. The sentry hears you, fidgets on his post. Another word and you will have him in. I shall be hanged for aiding your escape, And you dishonoured in the worlds wide eyes: Men pardon an escape, if you succeed And brave again the battle; but if not, If you are caught while in the very act, They call you coward. And my life, I own, I will not give for nothing. Get you gone; Or both of us is lost, instead of one. Monmouth. O noblest man that ever trod the Earth! O kindest friend that ever loved a man! With force compelling me to save my life At the expence of thine, by what great act Can I keep dear the memory of thy love? Lambourne. Deliver me my letter: that is all. Begone, good Master Lambourne I would pray And God forgive me all my lies today. (Exit M. (End of Act The Second.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act The Third. Monmouth. I. (Lambourne's garret in scene one, Act Second.) Monmouth, Jerome. Monmouth (after a long silence.) How long d'you think? Quick! answer me you fool! Jerome. It must be close upon the hour by now Monmouth. Should we have time to go there yet d'you think? Jerome. For what on earth, Lord Duke, do you inquire? Monmouth. I do not knowâI cannotâO my God, I wish that I had never taen this scheme! O would I were the doomed one still! (Rushes to the door. Jerome. My Lord! My Lord! what sudden idiotcy is this? What, where and why? I will not let you go. Monmouth. Unhand me! What, is he to die for me? Will you be partner in this murder, too? O Lambourne, I will save you yet my friend! One cry from all the seething flood of heads, And from the blank, white blaze of upturned eyes A sudden stream of hope. Come let me go. (As they wrestle, a gun is heard in the distance.) Jerome. The signal gun! Monmouth. Too late! too late! too late! O Jerome you have served me wrongly here! Jerome. I saved you from yourself, Lord Duke: that wrong? Monmouth. O Lambourne, Lambourne, truest, greatest friend, The earth is grim without you! And for meâ To think of it!âit was for me indeed. And it is you, accursÃ¨d menial hound, That held me back or argued me aside As ev'ry nobler impulse moved my heart; And but for your smug face and polished words, I had been honest once againâin death! Jerome. Nay, is this fair? You will not beat me, sir? Come, come, this is a deal too bad, you know. I risk my life to serve you, ev'ry hour; And when forsooth your twisting fancies changeâ Forsooth I must be beaten! (Enter Mrs. Lambourne by a middle door.) Here she comes! Mrs. Lambourne. What, Michaelâback? But no: it is not he! I heard the gun this minuteâwho is this? Come Jerome, tell me quickly who is this, That is so like my son, so like as wellâ Jerome (cutting in.) This, Mrs. Lambourne, is a worthy Lord, And one who loves and much affects your son, Who has come here to see youâBy the way, How is my Michael? Mrs. Lambourne. He is dead, good sir. He left the house unnoticed yestermorn, And as I searched, I found a note for me Saying that he was dying, telling me That one should come with money, which, he said, Was his fair earning and no alms. But now, I see the meaning, piece by piece I grasp The cloudy links of all the dismal chain. He was so like youâcruel, cruel lord! This money that you bring me Dukeâfor such Your title is and such your business hereâ This money is the price of his dear blood. You know the parable that Nathan told To erring David, whil'st the people died? You had your lands, your armies, light o'loves: Then wherefore rob me of my only lamb? What! touch your money! Can you pay with gold The priceless life that you have robbed me of? Forth! or stay here! the house is yours my Lord! For he, my murdered darling loved your cause. But keep your face, your cruel, handsome faceâ Iâ O my son! my son! (Exit. Jerome. With what a woeful cry her heart broke forth! Monmouth. The woman's madâa curse upon her tongue! Jerome. She was not mad before this mornings work Monmouth. Enough! I'll hear no more. I feel enough Without the acrid poison of your words To burn the suffering in upon my heart! D'you wish to kill me fellow? ââDrove her mad!â Thats what the man would say: âI drove her mad!â (He walks up and down the room.) When will they bring us tidings? Jerome. Shortly now. Monmouth. Stay! what is this? His writing paperâsee? I have the right to read in't have I not? He died for me, and I, I live for him. But yet I know not. I may find in here The touching records of some innocent love Whose blossomed blushes I have blighted here. I scarcely dare to open it and see. (Opens the port-folio. Some crabbed law paper he was copyingâ The sketch of characters and scenes and plot For some tremendous, thundering Tragedyâ Ha! what is this? Some jottings on a sheetâ Nay, Jeromeâlisten hereâ âI might have had a life-time for repentance: I gave the lifetime to another man: God will not judge me hardly.â There it ends. Ah Lambourne! thou wert right! My God, my God! Death is but restâa sudden, palsying stroke That sheds our ripening husks about the root To spring again in pleasant, mossy nooks Below the blustering gallantries of storm. Ah yes! all night the storm's among my hair, But heâthe night is over now for him. Eternal dawn is springing. Easy death! Would I had died it for him! Over now The narrow instant that divides our day From God's eternal majesty of life. Gone would be all my troubles, all my sins, And I, upfloating through the morning air, Already past the narrow husk of light That girds our globe, should hear her weeping me, And see her tears rise past me through the dark, Each one a point of light to lead me up. To die is so much easier than to live! All that I think perchance had staggered me, Was that white vacant blaze of eyes, I said. In every head, a pair of eyes, each eye Pinned steadily to my visage through the hour. But ev'n with that I could have died it well, Put careless hand on jaunty hip the while, And out-stared death, the hoary, leprous ghost. âAnd now I've lost my chance to die so well, Now, rolled in feverous sheets, ignobly pained, I yield through fierce and bitter hours my soul, Death looking at me for a year, perhaps, Before he stops the torment. Lambourne yes! Yours was the happier, easier part to bear. Sin, life, pain, grief are over now with you. He was a noble fellow, was he not? Jerome. He wasâmy Lord, your words are surely mad, Or you, at worst: what nonsense might this be? That you had rather died than lived in peace: Full little thanks, to Lambourne that, methinks. Monmouth. Well Jerome, I can give his own, old words To prove he thought the same in this as I. 'Twas in old happy daysâAh God, how old! Gone never to return!âwhen first I saw Her whom I see in fancy at this hour. This Lambourne loved her tooâa country loutâ Aye, Jerome, lifted up his thoughts to her. He told me then (for I approved the boy, And was as kind as one so high could be) That when he studied far into the night, His window open for the summer wind That threshed the moonlight, through the foliaged oak, Into a shower of vague and spectral gemsâ That then, when, from the night slow buzzing in, The moths came round his candle, he would oft Extinguish what to them was joy and death. âI wonder now if I were right in that And did as kindly as I meant,â said he. âPerhaps 'tis best for men and moths as well To burn their lives out round the thing they loveâ Not, thwarted and repressed, to turn their cares To safer paths with meaner goals before!â Jerome. Aye! did he say so? weaker than I thought! Ask if the moths, you speak of, âbuzzed out lifeâ Without a fiery agony of death. Ask Lambourne nowâ Monmouth. Enough! Jerome. Stay! Hearken now! There comes the answer. Hark! his mother weeps. Monmouth. She weeps? O God! This place is stifling me! I will go in and try to calm herâno! Lost, useless, branded with the curse of blood, What use is life to such as I? Jerome. My Lord! What sudden paroxysm is this, my Lord? Your life, now purchased for anothers, bears A double weight of duties. Monmouth. Duties? I? Man, I am cursed? My clothes are wet with blood: There is a dead man's hand upon my breast. The only thing that I have left to do To die, die quickly, surely, gladly die! Give up my life as sacrifice for his, Since his was giv'n as hostage's for mine. Pistol or knife? Jerome. My Lord, my Lord, I pray. I do beseech thee: think of us, of her! I pray thee think. Monmouth. It will not do: he died, And I die alsoâAh but hear who sings! Milly (singing without.) The old grange-moat is muddy and the lily cups are few: The Ferny Copse is blurred with rain that gems the grass like dew About the soddenned garden, where the trees are pinched with cold, And the fallen rose-leaves wither on the rain-bedabbled mouldâ About the misty garden, as the evening closes in, I walk in darkling sorrow, punished for another's sin. Henrietta, name and honour, heart and body, soul and fame, All were taken, riven from you, when the blust'ring noble came And I cannot even please me, as the darkness grows above Joying that I loved so nobly, priding me upon my love. Even that is taken from me: blighted is your very name, All the world is pointing at you, and my love is but a shame. Monmouth. O Jerome, do you hear it? it is his. No question of it; and he loved her so. The little child ascends. Ah! comes she here? (Enter Milly.) Milly. What! Michael are you come again to us! Your mother said you'd gone away for good; But I did not believe her. How you stare! What is the matter with you MichaelâO! You do not thank me for the song I sang, The song you made and loved so much to hear. What is the matter, Mike? You look so strange. You are not ill? Tell Milly how you are. You will not speak to Milly? Are you dead? They told me you were dead last morning, Mike; But I was up so early, in the grey, To light the fire before my mother woke And make her laugh and praise me when she saw, And so I saw you going down the stair, Against the morning, tears upon your cheeks; And when they told me you were dead, I cried, Said âWho'll be kind to little Milly now? And teach her songs and help her for the school?â But scarce believed it; and so here you are. Why do you never speak? Say, shall I sing? Monmouth. My little girl, I am not he you think. IâO! I am the worst, the worst of men! Your friend, my friend, the noblest, truest man Is really dead; nor will you see him more. But Iâif you would but consentâI canâ I'll try to teach you reading for your school. I'll try to be a Michael to you, dear. Milly. What are you crying, too? You grown-up men They cry so often! Michael cried this morn. Poor Michael, shall I never see him more? And did you know him? Could he not be saved? One day, my mother died upon the floor, But Mrs. Lambourne came and wet her face And so she came alive again. And you, How do they call you? You are like to him. I hope you are as kind. Monmouth. But tell me dear, Who was the Henrietta in your song, And did he speak about her? Milly. Her? Ah no! He only wrote his pretty songs of her. Say, shall I tell you who I think she was? I think she was an angel, one in white, Like her that sits beside good children's beds And hushes them all night with great, white wings. Monmouth. Ah little one, she is no angelâstill If you would like to see her, come with me. Milly. I do not knowâI think I'd rather not. You see he said, she had been changed a deal: A wicked man had smutched her, as the boy, The horrid little boy next door, once smutched My new-washed Sunday gown. Ah wicked man! Monmouth. But little one, he meant no harm that man. You should not judge him hardly: he was wrong; But yet he thought, he only did the right. Milly. Poor man! he had not read the bible, then. O! if you know him give him mine, kind sir, To show him he is naughty. (Enter Mrs. Lambourne.) Mrs. Lambourne. Milly! come! Milly. This gentleman is very kind to me: I do not want to leave him. Mrs. Lambourne. Come at once! That wicked man is he who murdered Mike! (Exit with Milly. Monmouth. The hag of Satan! had she left me her I might have ris'n to good! Jerome. Excuse her, Lord. Tis natural she should be flighty now, When she is newly rest of him she loved: As for the little girl, her mother may Be somewhat easier about the gold And take it, blood and all! Monmouth. A happy thought! Go you at once and give the gold to her. I will wait here lest we should miss the Lords That bring me news of how theâbusiness went! (Exit Jerome. I'll ope the windows. Did it rain last night? I had forgotten: I suppose it did. How sweet the roses smell that drape the house! Give me a morning after rain. Alas! And he no longer here to breathe the air. (A pause: enter certain Lords.) Monmouth. Ah here at last! Quick! speak now you are here! Did he die easy? 1st Lord. Easy? I am sick! Tenânay, a dozen blows! He moved at last! 2nd Lord. O God they took a knife. He would not die! 3rd Lord. For me, I saw blood, blood about it all. He flung the axe downâKetch, refused to strike. O never, never was there such a death! 4th Lord. I dipped my kerchief in his noble blood: Say, would you have itâ'tis your saviour's blood! Monmouth. God! what is this? The roomâI chokeâmy God! 1st Lord. Stand back! Seeâgive him air, my Lords. 2nd Lord. Hear too; He kept your character until the last, Yea pledged his holy soul for your conceits, He said you had not sinned. Monmouth. No more we had! What dog among you dares to say we had? My Lords excuse me: I am nearly mad. O God, how I repent this evil scheme. Ask Michael Lambourne how I liked the plan! Ask the dead body how he argued meâ What glamour is there in your cursÃ¨d eyes? 1st Lord. We think, Lord Duke, you were not right in thisâ Monmouth. Who asked you what you thought? 1st Lord. In vain Lord Duke, You cannot wash out blood with hasty words: The stain is madeâ Monmouth. What stain? I'll show you how! Job's comforters that come to work my grief And through your words of scorn about my soul. Clear hence, unworthy traitors! out of this! Profane no longer by a treach'rous port This last retreat of a deserted King! Out! spawn of Satan! out! unworthy mob! (Exeunt Lords. Great Heaven! is this to be the end. To hear Insult on insults, curse on curses heaped, And all because this duffer, scrivener here Chose trip upon the scaffold in my place. I'll see his letter first before 'tis giv'n Lest Henrietta too be turned to gall. (Tears open Lambourne's letter will reads. What! Knows not of it! Loved her all his life! Aha, the rest the same: smooth, clerkly phrase: A heap of âburning wordsâ (he'd call them so): An incoherent wash of egotism, With here and there a little stroke at me. What! could the fellow not disguise contempt, When he was going to die? But worst of all, SheâHenrietta, knew not what it meant, The letter that she wrote, the scheme he broughtâ Nor shall she! Stay! the letter! It can wait! (Enter Jerome. Jerome, with me! we go to her, you know: And, harkye, mum about the noteâyou see! II. (The old house on the Thames, as in Act I.) Monmouth, Henrietta. Henrietta. I like it? no indeed! How should I dear? The black, grim, wicked, mouldy, dreary houseâ The great black oaken tunneling and the patch Of leprous garden sloping to the stream! I like it? Verily, it is not so! So much, indeed, my dear, that I have prayed A thousand times to get another house Andâah! in all our hurry here, I had forgot to tell you itâmy love, We leave the house this evening. Monmouth. Do we, sweet? I scarcely think so, scarcely so tonight. Henrietta. O yes we shall! we must! I'll have it so! I hate the barren dreary place too much To let it shadow our first days for us! Ah! it seems pleasant now! I think so too! The warm hot day, the wavy struggling rays That beat athwart the dusty, clouded windows And hang, a smiling on the oaken roof,â They, dear, and you have changed the house; but I, Who can remember all that went before, I hate itâ Then besides, I had forgot 'Twill vex him sore, who got the house for me If, after all his trouble, I went not: methinks Twould seem some thankless in me not to go. He was your rival (fancy!) for my love! But you'll forgive him that when once you hear The trouble that he gave, the time he spent In granting me my weakest, silliest whims! Monmouth. Who is he then? I shall reward him well. Henrietta. Forgetting jealousy? Monmouth. For jealousy, my love, Who can be jealous of an angel, eh? Henrietta. You think he was an angel, too, like me? You think he was an angel? Monmouth. Nayâbut you! How could I say he was an angel, love: You've never told me who the angel was. Henrietta. Why we both knew him, when we met at first. He used to follow me about the parkâ A great way off, you know! quite modest dear!â And gather lillies for me off the moat, And lurk beside the rotten ferry boat If he supposed that I should want to cross That he might pull me overâpoor, pale lad! Now Michael Lambourne. âWhy, my love what now? You are not jealous, Monmouth? Monmouth. Nay not I. Henrietta. Well, dear, I pray you tell me how he is. We women love so much to be beloved That all who love us are in one way loved. So dear, you see, I wonder much of him. If you had seen how sad he looked that dayâ Now when he took the letter and the rope,â And told you of the window! had I known I never should have written it. Ah love! How did you dare to take the awful leap? My hero!âah! you fidget, bend your brows. True merit allways hates to hear its praise: I never saw it much in you before: Haâha! you must be getting truerâeh? But what of Lambourne? Monmouth. He is very well! I know naught of himâhe is very well! Henrietta. O Wise my Lord! We thank thee for the news! âYou know naught of him!â âHe is very well!â Trustworthy news! I feared it from the first. You men are all so jealous and so rough! You will not speak of this good man to me! Monmouth. O I am sick of this confounded knave, Out-cropping ever talk with whom I will! Henrietta. Confounded knave? I saw no knavery there: The lad seemed good enoughânot handsome: no! He was a deal too like my Lord for that!â And did his best to please me. Monmouth. Lady sweet, Sure you can find some other ground for talk. He is a knaveâa low, mean drunken knave, âAn empty pot boy, with a parson's drawl!â Henrietta. Your lordship stops? Have you no more fair words? âNay Monmouth, where fine pale and drawn? Monmouth. No more! I am not well tonight: I am not strong. Henrietta. Not well my love! Forgive my banter then: We'll say no more of this grave jealousy. Monmouth. Not so: I have some more to say of him. God pardon me that I have been unjust And shameless in mine idle, jealous wrath. Henrietta. How now? What is there that you have to say? What marvel have you to unfold?âyour words Come warm and vehement from a throbbing heart: What is it, dear? Monmouth. IâO! I only meantâ That is I meant that he was not so badâ But foolish: that was all. Henrietta (laughing.) What that is all? Monmouth. Well, well my love! I did it in a jestâhe! he!âa trick my love: I meant to make you laugh and it is done. Henrietta. And easily it may be done, my dear! Laughing or crying (scarce it matters which!) Alone can ease the fulness of my joy. O dear! I never really hoped this hour. I used to think that you would surely die And I be left an outcast on the world With naught but the remembrance of my love. 'Twas Lambourne always told me 'twould go well; And sure he found a sceptic listener here! Do you not think 'twas rather good in him, Considering he loved me, dear, himself, To work so hard to save his rival's life? Some people would have let you die, you know, Or even killed you, thinking: âhe and I Are so alike in face, that he being deadââ And that, the refference to your likeness dear, Has put in mind the length his love would go: I trapped his noble scheme, his mad, great scheme In some hot words he said to keep me up: He meant to give his very life for yoursâ Had done so, as I verilly believe, If your bold heart had failed to try the leap, Of course, when he came here, (as come he would) To tell his scheme and feast on grattitude That, like strong wine to the body, nerves the heart For ev'ry noble deedâwhen he came here, Of course I should have told him to desist, And not insult you with hisâ Monmouth. There!âenough! What! can you find no subject but that man? Is this the talk that I am doomed to hear On this the evening of my great escape, And the first night that I have seen your face? Henrietta. What Monmouth! Awry once again. Ah dear! Wait till I kiss your wonted humour back! You're still the prisoner: in a little while, Perhaps you'll turn the lover once again. âAh, âprisonerâ! that reminds me. Tell once more How deep the chasm looked and how the bar Bent, straining towards the hideous depth with you. Ah! my brave love, my strong, ripe, nervous man I think that you deserve a kiss for that! Monmouth. For Heaven's sakeâI beg your pardon dear, But I have grown so peevish. Leave these things, These hated, dreary tales about myself; And tell me rather all you thought and did, Pent in the shadows of this dreary house, That through the figured agonies of your grief, My heart may catch the throbbings of your love. Henrietta. Ah dear, they are not pleasing to recall, I saw a crowd of darksome images, Churned in red blood and wrapped in sickly mist And prinked with spots of fire from dazzled eyes!â The pale, white flashing of the whirling axe Glimmering, a feeble dawn, through years of gloomâ And if I dreamed of waters, spurted blood, And, if of you, I saw a mouldering corpseâ SometimesâO God!âthe executionâsaw The jerkined murderer strikeâagain, again!â But this hurts you as much as me, I mark. I put it past. Such silly thoughts I had: Nay, worse than sillyâwicked now I think! I doubted God and feared that we had sinnedâ Once even dreamed that I had found a text That made us wrong: it ran âThis wicked andâ Thisâthisâthis generation seek a sign, And shall not get one: something that our Lord Said of the scribes and pharisees I think. And IâI laugh to see how weak I wasâ Supposed this had been spoken for ourselves: As if I might not have applied all texts As well as this oneâas for instance this: âWell done thou good and faithful servant.â Still The foolish thing disturbed me. Then I tried All sorts of silly, foolish little means To cheat me into resignation. Hereâ Nay where? O yes! just listen now to this: I'll read you a song I wrote to calm my mind. 'Tis very rough: together you and I Will polish it some happy idle day: Can he be gone from the dusking earth,â Gone with my love and my hope and my lifeâ Gone with the sweetness and kissing and mirthâ Gone with the glamour and glitter of strife. Sing me a snatch from the breezy hill As a balsam and cure to my heart: Sing me the song that the hasty rill May lisp to the banks as they part. Gone with my love, but jealousy tooâ Gone with my burning blushes and shameâ Gone with the glamour of war, 'tis true, But gone with it's peril and blame. Hope I no more, it is true, in the world; But fear I no longer therein: With the hope of his goodness down-hurled I am free from the fear of his sin. You see it is a silly piece my dear: The last four lines are clumsy. Monmouth. Well! well! well! 'Tis very clever, dear, and neat and nice; But merely proves my love I should be dead Instead of joying with me on my life. It is so easy to seem great, when once The dusky doors of death are shut behind: All little peevishnesses, faults are lost: To mention them were but to insult the dead: There can be no more sin. But I'm alive. Henrietta. Well brood no more upon it love: 'twas you Made me recall that maddened hateful time With all its empty comforts and grim cheer. Tell me my love, how has no hue-and-cry Reach'd even us about your strange escape; I marvel much we have not heard the mob Baffled of blood, bemoan their lost delightâ Indeed I even thought I heard the gunâ Monmouth. I do not know love, do not want to know; I am so worne and tired with wanting rest That I would fain you would be silent, dear, And let me snatch an evening slumber thus. Henrietta. Well love, 'tis as you wish it. Put your head Upon my lap andâsoâgive me your hand That I may hold and kiss it as you sleep. (A pause: he sleeps.) Poor wearied darling! hard-earned sleep perhaps! But yet, I know not: slumber likes me not. He never said a word about my songâ At least he did not seem to hear itâWell! Had Michael Lambourne heard it, he, perhapsâ Back wandering tongue that gives the lie to love! Ah! poor, sad Monmouthâerring, noble heartâ King, landless and bereft of all but meâ I'll let you know that I am worth them all, And, if you sometimes fail to see my love, I'll put my bosom close against your breast And so your heart shall feel the throbs of mine And know it beats for you and you alone! Ha! what? a letter? well: I pluck it forthâ I'll read the letter: 'tis address't to me: He has forgot to give it. (A pause: she reads.) Monmouth (awaking.) I have not slept so long: is aught amiss? Ah Henrietta, you have dropped my hand That like a slighted lover, stiff and cold Trails disregarded on the floor. Whats that? A letter? 'Fish! I'm jealous! Let me see. âO! (Feels in his pocket. Henrietta. My Lord has spoken. Why does he now pause? Is he deserted by his usual words? Methought he would have found a honied stream Of soft excuses, till my ear was tired: But no! My Lord is silent: wondrous chance! Monmouth. O Henrietta hear me but a word, And sneer not on me so: you drive me mad. Henrietta. Hear him indeed! I hearken to his words! I would not hear his voice again for me! The poor man prayed thee: 'twas his latest wish (At least he says so here) to send me this, The last memorial of his love and life. Monmouth. I meant to give it youâI meant indeed: By all I hope for you'd have had the note. Henrietta. And is the poor man dead, a martyr now To his great love for me: I see it all: Twas thus he strove to linger by me here And stole my gloveâO Tiger, tiger's heart! Monmouth. I pray you hearkenâ Henrietta. Hearken! what? to you? To you who stole his young unhappy life And hid the letter in your traitrous breast; And when I spoke of him, whatânot one word But âdrunken pot-boy,â âSwilling knave,â what notâ Are you a man, my Lord? My LordâO stayâ O tell me Monmouth it is all a lie!</field>
