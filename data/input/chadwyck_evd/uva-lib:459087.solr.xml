      <field name="fulltext">To my deserving friend S: H: on his excellent Tragedy, called the Fatall Union. Ingenious friend, T'adorne thy head, Apollo will not spare From violence his Daphne's tempting haire; Lo yon the Muses carrying circled boughs Strive, who should first come neare, and wreath thy browes; But sad Melpomene, (who knowes her right And title to the matter that you write.) Casts off the heavy buskins, which shee wore, Quickens her leaden pace, and runnes before; Hyes to pale Shakespeares urne, and from his tombe Takes up the bayes, and hither she is come; Thalia is her second who concludes Thee her's, from thy true Comicke interludes; The rest on Clio lay their crownes, that fame, May'nt want a bayes, when shee but sings thy name. Ben is deceas'd, and yet I dare avow. (Without that booke) Ben's redivivus now, I could beleeve a Metempsycosis, And that thy soule were not thine owne, but his Or else the Genius which did wait upon His worthy quill serves thee, now he is gone; But I observe this difference, thy braine Vents fancies with a pleasure, his with paine; His were mature indeed, they went full time Before they were deliver'd into rime; Thine were conceiv'd, brought forth at once, yet may As they are faire, be as long-liv'd as they; Who reads thy play-worke (Friend) needs not compell, Or force thy lines to make them paralell With his, unlesse 'cause thou contract'st in one Small part, what he in a whole play has done. His humorists in thy Alphonso ly: Sejanus, Catiline's damn'd treachery Lives in Ursini's treasons, there is not Ben's Fox can scape the policy o'th plot. 'Tis true, thine never walk't upon the stage, In fine, gay clothes (the praysers of this age,) Nor in a full throng'd theater did'st begge Confus'd applause, with a cring'd Courtiers legge; Such flatteries would abuse thy poÃ«m, thou Had'st nere an entrance, though an exit now; Thine is expos'd unto the worlds large eye, In it's unchang'd and native infancie, Before some Players braine new drencht in sacke Do's clap each terme new fancies on it's backe; Or in'ts front t'beares this apology For th'Stationer, it tooke his Majestie, After a third presentment, thou hast none Of these poore succours, thine is meere thy owne; And that so singular as thou may'st dare The quickest wit, severest censurer To view't, review it, and at length receive From thy intended enemy a wreathe, Nich. Downey, A. B. e C. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my loving friend S. H. on his Tragedy entituled Sicily and Naples, or the Fatall Union. Wonder not (friend) if I admire thy pen That has so lively drawne the deaths of men, And in such deeper scenes of Tragedy, Has cloth'd thy fury Comick-wittily: Thy lines runne smooth, and lofty, and expresse At once their terrour, and their pleasantnesse: Th'hast mingled mirth with horrour, and hast showne Delight and cruelty compos'd in one. Ferrando, and Calanth' are re-inliv'd, And have from thee their tombe, and birth deriv'd: Naples, and Sicily do owe their glory To thee for this their everliving story; Thy hand proclaimes their fame, thy pen has lent Their Chronicles a grace, and supplement: And what before was Fatall, now's become A Happy, and a lasting Union. Rob: Stapylton, A. B. Ant. Alban.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my deare friend the Authour on his Fatall Union. Thus (Friend) the bayes still flourish; Johnson dead, Randolph deceas'd, they fall to crowne thy head; Yet see, how full his flowing fancie meetes With thy rich Genius! and sweetly greets Thy first-borne infant, making almost one A jealous, and a Fatall Union: Thine is a full, stuff't, fluent wit, that speakes Meerly it's owne; not like the running leakes Of a crack't crazy braine, that dribbles forth Either but little, or what's little worth; His straines lift high too, thine mount; all confesse Both tyre expression with a curious dresse, And tricke it up so neatly, 'tdoth surpasse; The Muses sure lent both a looking-glasse; The difference (if any) this may be, Chame brought him up, but Isis foster'd thee. 'Twixt thee and him (Great Ben!) a parallel Would chance strike credit deafe, make envie swell, Swell then who list, and burst; since deads thy heire, He's to thy wit the sole Executer: (T. Randolph.) The legacies being paid, all he assayes, S'no more than what he well deserves, thy bayes: His Muse but yet new borne hath felt thy fate; And like thine glories in the rabbles hate; As soone as shee had life, she was wish't dead, Or under her owne ashes buried; But now a glorious PhÅnix rais'd is shee From this and her supposed Tragedie. Rich. Doddridge. A. B. C. Exon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my good friend the Authour. If fancie, language, wit, deserve the praise That's due to Poets, (friend,) then take the bayes; For this thy PoÃ«m who so reads, in it Shall finde a loftie fancie, a quicke wit, In such smooth language clad, so pure, so free From affectation, or obscuritie, That nothing here's superfluous, lest to be Full fraught with wit, be superfluitie: 'Tis policie in some, whose workes are lame, To set their friends i'th front, that their false fame May make their lines be read; others, whose worth Deserves all praise, as foyles to set them forth: Such friends are wee to you, our lines and wee Serve but for foyles unto thy worke, and thee, Which to it selfe and you can onely raise An everlasting Monument of praise. A. Short. A. B. C. Exon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my friend the Authour on his Fatall Union. What? Printed though not acted? do's this age Use to employ the Presse before the Stage? Perhaps thy Tragedy did claime such state As none of us should fitly personate: Or swell'd so full of fancie, we might feare A pleasant surfeit taken through the eare; How as distraught with too much sense, wee finde Calantha shew her fixt, unsettled minde; Distraction cloth'd in such a dresse of wit, That even staid judgements well may envie it: Them thrice, thrice happie I esteeme to be That are indued with such rare Lunacy. Felicia from her sex, and friends exil'd, Is pregnant with conceits, as great with child: While wee mov'd by her passion, love her more, Than e're she doated on the Prince before. Methinkes Valenzo, and Charintha meete Chastly though yet unmarried, in one sheete; At length the wish't Catastrophe combines Her myrtle and his bay, in amorous twines: Ursini to our censure doth commend A faithlesse Traytour, though most truly penn'd, And masked Zisco, though thrice blacker now, Richly: deserves the Readers Candid brow: Thy quill upholds Ferrando's royaltie, Who before Naple's King, s'now crown'd by thee; Changing the golden circlet of his brow For verdant sprigges, crop't from thy Laurell bough: Thy interludes so apt, their queintnesse such, Our mirth doth make us wrong thy plot too much; To which (like thy Physitian) streight wee fly, Abhorring others skilfull'st harmony. Go on, brave Genius, though some fooles controule The envy'd soaring of thine active soule. Ed: Hall. A. B. C. Exon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Authour on his Fatall Union. Instead of high rear'd trophies to thy praise Th'hast rais'd up envious tongues, to blast thy bayes; Forth' Muses, and their darling PoÃ«ts be Conjoyn'd in one sad plot, to ruine thee: The Muses charge thee with flat Felony, Complaining thou hast robb'd their treasury, And left them dowerlesse; Then the PoÃ«ts plot, Is how to staine thee with extortions blot; Since th'hast engross't all wit, and set a price. So high, that he's undone who ever buyes; So that their best endeavours, with small wares Must be pack't up, to visit Country Faires; Or lye neglected, till some hand assigne Perhaps that happy chance, to cover thine: But let them spit their gall; whilst wee admire The mounting flames of thy PoÃ«ticke fire: Go on to stirre their envie; since blinde fate Doates onely on the worst, purchase her hate. Ioh: Hall. Jur: Stud: Aul: Alb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Authour. The Fatall sisters sure are muses growne, Else whence proceeds this Fatall Union? Or Muses Fatall sisters wee discry Those in thy Play, these in thy Tragedy: I'th front o'th booke, a troope all prest to be Guards to thy Naples, and faire Sicily, So many lines, and thou their center; Quils To impe thy winged Pegasus, and rills Paid to thy Hippocrene, a tribute show, Which we as subjects to thy crowne do owe, Leaves to thy Laurell; not to decke thy head, But strew the way, wherein thy buskins treade, As at thy Muses marriage; whom till now We thought confin'd by some o're-maiden vow To live encloystred; and for want of men Wooe images, and pictures; but thy pen Has made her now a Mother; see her laid In Geniall sheetes, where she's no more a Maid, But a chaste Prostitute; nay more I'le sweare She is, Oâa female ravisher: For which, as a crackt Vestall, some did strive With vaine attempts to bury her alive; Things hid'in wide-sleeve gownes, all you can see Of Artists in them is, they'r come t'A. B. Men that thy play, as some new lesson con, And hacke, and mangle thy blest Union; Poore fooles! I pitty th?; how would they looke, If at the barre Ben Johnson were their booke? His fox would on these geese revenge thee so, We should no hissing but i'th Common know; Nor neede they other halter, Catiline Affords them rope enough, in each strong line: But thou may'st pardon them, whose spight has made Thee famous, whilst, like the sad owle affraid Of wrens, thou hast unto thy Ivy fled, And where thou thought'st to hide, hast crown'd thy head: They now must stand, and gaze with us, which bee Alas too ignorant to censure thee. We know not whether we should wring our hands, Or clap them at thy poÃ«m, which commands As much our griefe as pleasure, not an eye That reads, but acts in teares thy Tragedy: Nay we are more then actours, thou may'st call Us mourners, and thy play a funerall: Champions all steele, (which ne're shed drop but those Forc't from their veines, not by their friends, but foes,) At each sad accent, sweare they'r stabb'd i'th eye, Betray their babies there, and downe-right cry. But when we turne our eyes, and marke thy veine, Streight our too much of joy is all our paine, We stand enchanted, every word appeares A charme, lines circles, letters characters, Which ravish us to phrensie: had wee seene It acted, sure thy Tragedy t'had bin; Our claps had thunderstrooke thee, thou would'st call This hand a club, that Brontes iron maule, T'other Pyrachmon's, the loud scene would be Their forge, (the Ãtna of thy Sicily,) Thundering upwards: but thy Muse doth need No claps, or loud applause, (like swans which breed Onely in noyse) to give her issues birth, No Hums, nor Dam-me-boyes to set her forth: Scorning all glory that is not her owne, Nor needing a Blacke-Fryers shaven crowne, (As some,) to wispe her temples, though put forth So poore, that six-pence charge buyes all she's worth; She'le out-blaze bright Aglaura's shining robe: Her scene shall never change, the world's her Globe.

What though your dull fat Senators, those land-Porpices, That skip, and friske i'th storme they n'ere are hurt with, Those heavy lubbers, lapt in sweaty furres, Batning on sleepe and ease, lie snorting out The peace poore Souldiers purchase, And not so much as dreame of toyle, or danger, Sleight what they are ignorant of: yet you (my Lord) May know, if cold and lazy recompences injure Our high deserts, such usage kils outright: Gal. True Contareno, that is their intent. Cont. L'as we bring no diseases home with us, unlesse valour be one; no meager troopes of thinne starvelings, that they should feare a famine from our commerce, we have fed high, though somewhat irreverently: nor returne wee in our old skins, blew coats, thrum'd cappes, that harbour so much vermine, they might feare we'de scatter one of Egypts plagues among them; and make e'm all lowsie. Val. Enjoy the freedome of your speech; yet know That they are ignorant of these injunctions, And for a testimony of their loves Unto your faire deservings, are all ready To meete their Countries patriots, (so they terme you) After their ancient custome, with procession; Gal. Shew us an enemy then, or danger that is reall, And not the birth of feare, and we'le returne: Val. Nay, you may stay at home too: Gal. At home? Cont. 'Tis so: Our sons of peace have caught a surfeit, &amp; would be physick't for't: ha! doe they mutiny? doe the fierce rammes advance their hornes, to batter downe the walls that kept them safe? Val. Be more compos'd and heare me, though you hate Treason as ill as cowardice, yet I must Tell you, you're the men have brought The enemy home to Naples, I meane the army: For what lesse can I terme such a vast body, Consisting of such disproportion'd members; Flesh't with the spoyles of fertile Sicily, Enrich't with what a happy soyle can yeeld To an insulting conquerour; fed too With glorious hopes of ease, and plenty? You know how hard a taske you underwent To governe them abroad, when tam'd by want, Thirst, hunger, heate, and cold; judge then what sway Authority can beare, when by this change They are growne mad, and mutinous; who shall Compose their private jarres, and quarrels, when Their full cups adde fury to their pride? Gal. Enough: this speech hath cut of all reply, Val. Besides, you know Sicily is now in Naples; The Prince a captive to his Prisoner: How farre his easie nature may be wrought upon Is yet uncertaine, his yeares though they have outdone History, are not yet grown up to the ripenesse of experience. For my severity; (I'de gladly have You call it by another name;) it is My duty, (if not yours) i take it, to be vigilant. Gal. My Lord, thinke what I spake was but to gaine Satisfaction, which you have amply given. Cont. And what should I doe i'th City? that retaine No more of my education there, than what I gain'd In the Artillery yard: my company Would be shun'd there more than poverty, Or a disease; I should be interdicted The Court, meerly because I'me out of fashion, Or for feare of challengesâTroth for the Ladies, The homeliest please mee best; I am as much Too rough hewen for them, as they're too polisht for me My constitution requires a dispatch I'th vaulting businesse, beyond that of tedious Niceties, and wittie prologues. Val. GonÃ§ales, and Petrucchio's regiment I've left aboard to guard the fleete, your's must Make safe the Castle, and the land forts; you Cannot endeare mee more than by your circumspection; The Citty will be all in triumphat These nuptials, twixt our long divided houses; Thinke these Sicilian's, though you have wonne And forc't them to groane beneath your sword, may yet At heart be traitours; if not, oportunitie May make them so; at such a time as this Surprize is easie; history hath such examples, Unfortunate ones; and you'de be loath to adde Unto the number. Gal. You have chalk't out a way That leads to honour, and we are hastie To pursue it: Val. I shall report you noble. Cont. And Generall, de'e heare, if you meet with Ere a masculine feminine, that has impudence Enough, to follow an army, a wench of twagging hanches, And full thighs, send her to mee, she shall be my laundresse. Val. Good Captaine be lesse wild, and use mee, To the losse of honour. Exeunt Captaines. SCEN. II. Valenzo, a servant. (Enter Piero. Val. Didst meet with him?âhe's here already. Valenzo runs to embrace him, Piero retires. Piero!âwhy this distance? Is't in the power of severall climes to breake Our sympathies in nature? true, I have Bin long estrang'd from you, not from your vertue; Why then should you deny your strict embraces? Pier. Valenzo! you are growne too great, and glorious For my friendship; become a theame for Princes, Whose worthy acts in rich their high discourse: The greedy multitude, snatching each word, As it falls from 'em, weare your praise As their best ornament! Val. How have I lost my friend, And see Piero, for being so thou would'st Nor mocke, nor flatter me! Pier. Alas Valenzo! Your prejudice your Princes wisdome, and Your owne just merits, those favours yet Were never worne by them, that had not first Deserv'd them. Val. You meane these titles, vaine and emptie names; Let mee enjoy thee still, I'le disinvest My selfe of all additions, can but swell Our pride, not vertue up; my Ancestours Have left mee rich enough in title to Your friendship, and fore I forfeit that!â (Embrace.) That wee could mingle soules.â Pier. Though you be prodigall of your affections, Yet be not cruell to your Charintha, Who must needs suffer in this wilfull scorne, You throw on that your valour dearly purchast. Val. Charintha mine! I hold all worth in her. Pier. Were you as monstrous for impiety, as now You are fam'd for vertue, such was her pious thrift, In treasuring up her cleane and humble prayers, You could not die unpardon'd, every houre (As you are alwaies lyable to danger,) Can witnesse, with what forward zeale she begg'd Heaven, to avert the stroake before it came: We have taken so much pleasure in her orizons, That even prophane men to have heard her pray, Would turne devout, were there no merit in't. Val. No more; my reason yeelds unto my passion. And 'tis a joy requires mee meete it with My best temper; I would not surfeit Nor swallow it too greedily; some light mixture Of griefe would give a relish to't; tell me, comeâ What face weares the Court? how lookes it On our new dignities? Envie (like the Sunne) Darts her beames hottest on the rising bankes: Ursini the grand favorite, is at Court, And has his Princes bosome? Pier. That's his sanctuary, His safety lies there, yet (though I professe No augury) I foresee, and read His fall, all these vast glories which he boasts, Are built upon the ruines of Alberto, His tombe-stone is the basis of that building, Which we admire, but thinke not safe. Val. There was a noble house soone lost. Pier. Sooner (I beleeve) than t'will be forgotten; But what was that Frederico, Albert's sonne? Val. One that with his father's vertues Inherited his unhappy fate, young he was, And valiant; receiv'd and knowne so. Pier. Had hee beene lesse fam'd, he had not yet Beene number'd with the dead; (you are my friend, My Lord) I speake my thoughts, and freely;â Ursini endures no rivall. Val. I've maintain'd Faire correspondencie with him at distance, But like not his embracements. Pier. T'is dangerous to be neere him; There's such an Antipathy, twixt him, and vertue, He weares it's ruine in his lookes. Val. 'Tis strange, A Prince so wise and vertuours should not descry His falshood through his visour; or at least Lend eare to the loud cries of wronged Innocents. Pier. He hath no use of either eare, or eye, But what his lov'd Ursini lends him; hee Onely rules, and limits his affections; Suffers him not to cast a frowne or smile, But where he pleases; his next indearement, is His care o'th Princesse, our Sicilian captive: Whom sorrow for her fathers death, (slaine in The warre, by him that was design'd her lover; Our fam'd Prince Ferrando,) has brought Into a desperate melancholy; what reward He expects, I cannot tell, unlesse it be The Crowne: you have heard of her strange distemper? Val. And wonder at the sudden change: I've seene her, maugre all those sudden feares, Her tender age, and womanhood could urge; Stand in the head of troopes, that we ev'n fear'd They had engag'd some Goddesse in their quarrell; Beare up against the enemy, when her men Lay scatter'd in the plaines, like the ripe eares The wealthy harvest yeelds into the Grange. Pier. I know not how but sure sh'as made the King Wilde; he has such divers fits, as he had learn'd To be mysterious in's passion; I have seene him weepe, Like a fond mother o're her tender babe, Whom too rude fate has ravish't unripe from her: Then rave, and curse, talke as he wanted reason To guide his speeches Organ: or soft sleepe To recall his stragling senses: Mutter distracted thoughts in broken words, Untill he lights upon her name, and then He bowes at the recitall; blesses himselfe In th'often repetition of Calantha. Val. There's somewhat in't, her passion should lye hid So long, and now breake out so violently. She rather seem'd too thrifty, than too prodigall Of teares, when she left Sicily; and taught us To call't our chiefest happinesse, we should have A Queene, that raign'd at home, that bore more sway Over the people of her brest, than country. Pier. Alas poore maid! why now she's a true captive To passion, and to Naples: had shee beene still Queene over her great selfe, none could have said She'd beene unhappy; now, and not till now She's truly miserable. Val. 'Tis holinesse to pittie her. Pier. Our teares are better spent upon her sorrowes, Than our owne sinnes, she talkes so prettily, Clothes griefe in such a sad, and pious garbe, So void of any rudenesse, that wee see Composednesse in distraction, reason in madnesse; She never walkes but when she's led along, And that so faintly, as she had not spirits Enough to actuate her tender limbes: Want of meate and sleepe have made her seeme A living coarse: to see her weepe, you'de feare That every drop were her owne funerall teare. (Exeunt. SCEN. III. Enter Fungoso, Zisco running after him. Zis. âHell, and furies!â (kickes him, &amp; exit. Fun. Oh! oh! oh! A Moore! a divell! a meere divell! his very lookes spake him so, but for his club-foote, his damnable club-foote, (Asse that I was not to see it, I'me sure I feele it now,) 'tis an infallible signe: This damn'd Divell did I bring to Court, and preferr'd him; but I'me serv'd well enough, he that doe's the Divell a good turne shall be sure to bee thus rewarded. If I should chance to die a sinner (as 'tis ten to one but I shall,) hee'le know mee againe, for I shall carry his markes to my grave: because my Lord Ursini was pleas'd to exchange some few words with him in private, he grew so insolent, that I going to strike him (in passion, in choller I confesse) he falls a kicking me in'th open Court. Enter Cassio, and Gratti whispering 'Twas my Lord Ursini's command. Fun. And looks, as if he would, have spet fire; but had I not knowne him to be a divell indeed, I'de spet fire with him. Grut. How? so hot Signiour? Cassi. Men in anger may do any thing. Fung. Any thing? with your leave Sir, And you're a foole, and an asse.â Gives him a boxe on th'eare. Cass. Do'e find it so by my eares?â And I'le try what you areâ Grut. Draw i'th Court? I must see the peace kept. Fung. Gentlemen, you know I'me passionate, cholericke, somewhat cholericke. Cass. And I intend to physicke you for't; here's that will allay your heat. Grut. 'Tis downe already. Cassio puts up his sword. Fun. I won't be jeer'd. Grut. Wee intend no abuse, Signiour, wee onely came to gratulate your good fortune, you are turn'd favourite of late. Fung. It has pleas'd his Majesty to take some small notice of mee. Grut. Yes, and the Ladies speake high, &amp; gloriously of you. Fung. Of mee? Cass. You could not but observe it as you walk't the streets: you are the onely object they gaze at. Fung. In troth I did not thinkeâ Grut. Come you are modest now. Cass. Who was't you bless't to'ther day with a favour? Fung. I give a favour? Grut. Why man? you meant it should be seene. Fung. I slip't a point indeed in a Countesses chamber. Grut. Slip't a point? Fun. Drop't it, drop't it, but t'was not worth the taking up. Cass. And yet I've heard her boast it as a speciall gift from your owne hands. Fung. Indeed I flung it somewhat scornfuly, because shee was very importunate; troth I was angry, shee would have none but that. Grut. Wer't not for this filthy fretting humour of yours, I could tell youâ Fung. What good Grutti? Grut. Of a Lady. Fung. By my best hopes in love with me, is she not? Grut. I'me not so happy as to be acquainted with her intents, but I have heard her in my Lord Ursini's presence commend you highly. Fung. Prithee who is't? Grut. The Lady Charintha. Fung. The Lady Charintha; what should I do with her? she's honest, the onely precise Madame of the Court. Grut. They that drop the most beads, may commit the most sinnes, but wer't not so, you have a kind of tempting presence, and besidesâ Whisper. Fung. Oh! I understand you, she's his Lordship's reversion. Grut. St, not a word. Fung. I'le to her presently. Exit. Grut. This is my Lord Ursini's plot, to slander that Ladies chastitie. Cass. And he has charg'd me, to whisper't about Court, that he has enjoy'd her. Grut. I wonder much, since he seekes her himselfe in marriage, why hee should thus traduce her. Cass. On my conscience she's vertuous. Grut. His plots are darke, and mystie, but come, prithee let's leave this talke, we have state knowledge enough already to make us melancholy: I'le shew thee a scene of mirthâ Cass. Where lies it? Grut. This Physitian that was sent for hither from the Universitie to our melancholy Princesse, they say, indures no musicke, and I've prepar'd a whole confort of these gutscrapers this morning to salute him; no doubt but hee'le bee be very bountifull. Cass. If the varlets can make good use of his charity. Grut. I wonder much the Court endures him here; he's an odde humersome fellow. Cass. His art priviledges him. Exeunt. SCEN. IV. Ursini. a Servant. Ser. My Lord.â Urs. Conduct that Moore hither, and see wee have all privacie that may be. Ser. Hee shall weare my life upon his sword that enters without my leave. Exit Ser. Enter Zisco. Urs. See, he comes: here's one that's fit to kill a King, A thing, whose soule is nothing but a spot Transmitted from foule parricides, whose thoughts aside. Weare a more deepe and horrid blacke, than that Which spreads upon his bodyâ My Zisco welcome. Zisc. This day my Lordâ Urs. No more, I know what thou would'st say: I promis'd To endeare thee to Ferrando's love, and knowledge, Are you according to my instructions ready To meete all his demands? Zis. Perfect. Urs. With a forg'd Commendamus from his holinesse? Zisc. âOf my stout service done against the Turkes In the Lepanto battle, where I turn'd Christian, And was baptiz'd in mine owne blood. Urs. 'Tis well, but how stands't thou resolv'd for our designe? Zisc. Unmov'd as destiny. âCould you have told me of it in that minute I should have acted it, I'de owe you for The glory of a sinne, I might have boasted of; What we intend, nere rises to that height As what we act, because t'may prove abortive, And perish in the thought, and for such crimes, I onely have repentance. Urs. But he's a Princeâ Zisc. Why there's the honour on't, Killing the head, I kill the body too, And at one blow lay a whole Kingdome gasping. Urs. âOne upon whom attends a guard of men, And Angels, on whose brow divinity Sits character'd, a Majestie that darts Fork't arrows into the guilty soule, and strikes A palsied feare through every limbe and joy at Of the murderer. Zisc: Fancie, fancie this. I'me proofe against it; Ile take him in's cups When he's drunke, betray him to a rape, Or fowler sinne, then kill him in the act. Urs. Whom? Zis. The King. Urs. Traytour. Zis. 'Tis as soone done as thought of. Urs: He never lov'd thee Zisco, nor was knowne By speciall favours to deserve thee to him; But he has made me great, worne me in's soule; His father tooke mee up, when I was nothing, Bequeath'd me to him, as a care hereditary, Belonging to the Crowne, plac't mee so neere him, I've growne, and spread like a tall mountaine Cedar. Zisc: And dare encounter lightning, stand a thunder-bolt, Or enrag'd winds; contend with that high influence By which you flourish, yet nere feare a blasting: His favour is a tyranny; it is The pride of Princes, to be thought Gods here On earth, daring to mocke omnipotence, To create them favourites, set them aloft In their owne spheare, till remote Kingdomes gaze At their prodigious height, then in an instant Shoote them from thence, like falling meteors: Had he not lov'd you first, you could not be The object of his hate, you were too poore, And safe, when 'twas, to have him glory in Your ruines: innocence below enjoyes Security, and quiet sleepes, murder's not heard of, Treachery is a stranger there, they enjoy Their friends, and loves, without ravishment, They are all equall, every one's a Prince, And rules himselfe, they speake not with their eyes, Or browes, but with the tongue, &amp; that too dwells i'th heart: Were it but thus at Court, Alberto, your fam'd Marquesse had not fallen.â Urs. Alberto: ha. Zis: Why start you Sir? Urs: 'Tis he: Frederico. Aside. Oh that man! he was unhappie in his Princes love. Zis: Your honours are no more your owne than his: 'T was the same favour that conferr'd them both, And the same frowne may take 'em both away: He lets you onely grow till you are envy'd, And then you'le fall unpittied. Urs. I have learn'd cruelty from him: Zisco, thou shalt applaud the mysteries, The rare contrivances of my revenge; My fate lyes in his brest, but this, this arme Shall ravish't thence. Zisc. Now your rage becomes you: When Princes put off their humanity, Murders, a holy sinne, you may be good, And fall like him, whose aged head lies low, Low in the dust. Urs. Againe? this confirmes it. Aside. Zis. The groanes of whose sunke house, are heard To affright strangers; whilst Naples yet Stain'd with the purple tyde, his soule swam forth in, Do's blush at it's owne guilt; his sonne Frederico (You know) was lost at Sicily in a croud. Urs. 'Tis so reported, yet I beleeveâ Zisc. My Lord. Urs. That he was slaine at Ferrando's command. Zis. Perhaps and by a slave. Felicia too, unhappy maidâ Urs. Your sister, (aside,)âI there, Now thou strik'st home. Zis. First wonne to his embraces By vollies of false oathes, her virgin honour Rifled, her chast wombe swolne with the imposthume Of his salt lust, then torne with spight from's bosome, Ravish't, murder'd, and by whom? (I could hate my selfe, For taking birth amongst such,) cursed Moores: Were shee your enemy, her cause, and sex Would challenge pitty; but you lov'd her dearly, The Mistresse you ador'd; who then can thinke But that your soule is blacke, and stain'd as his, That are thus tame? Urs. Zisco, th'ast rais'd a flame within this breast Nought but his blood can quench:âthanks to my braine;â It shall be so;âThe fatall raven croakes; 'Tis ominous, if he outlive this night We are no more:âCome we'le goe plot within. Exeunt. SCEN. V. Grutti. Cassio. Grut. Here's his, studie, Cass. Is he there? Looking from the Stage through the bangings Grut. Yet do but observe his posture: How he sits like a reverend Ape painted upon a Gally-pot, with an Urinall in's hand. Cass. Faith Signior, in my judgement y'have wrong'd your simile. Grut. He's casting the Princesse's water. Cass. Not upon his beard I hope. Grut. Reading in'tâ Cass. The colour of's copper-nose. Grut. All the plots of Sicily; I warrant the poore Lady has not a thought escapes him. Cass. The Sex has beene allwayes accounted open, yet I neere knew a State betray'd that way; some Ladies would be in a pittifull case, if their secrets could be read in their Gentlewomansâ Enter musitians. Grut. Foh, they're mere sives. âCome, come, these are his Lordships Lodgings, He came home late yesternight, and I beleeve Is scarce stirring yet.âYour last new tune, Soft musicke Cass. This musicke sure will make him dance antick. Grut. Not yet? poxe on him, he's a sleepe in's studie: ha you noe loud musicke? perhaps his Lordship likes that better. Bent. So, ho, oh, ho, ho, murder, murder, murder, Cass. Enter Hieronymo from his naked bed. Loud musicke. Enter Bentivoglio. Gr. Hieronymo was drunke then last night, he lay in's clothes. Bent. Rogues base rogues, scabby rogues, pockie rogues, out, out rascals, abuse his Majesties Physitian, offer to play under my nose, foh, how the Grutty and Cassio stept behind the hangings. rogues stinke: farts, poyson'd farts, foh, these meager-chapt rascalls eate so much brimstone, and salt butter, that they outstinke hell: had these farts beene let in Wales, they would have bred the plague there,âlet mee seeâ who should this bee that should abuse mee thus, let mee but finde him out, and be he the best i'th Court, it shall goe hard but I'le have a quaint poison for him, shall worke a little otherwise with him than this has done with me. Enter Grutti, and Cassio, as over-hearing him. Cass. The best i'th Court? Grut. A quaint poyson for him. Cass. Do's your retirednesse lead you to treason? let's apprehend him: Grut. For a Traytour. Bent. Nay good Gentlemen, what shall I do? I'me undone. Cass. A quaint poyson Iâso it was. Grut. And for the best i'th Court. Bent. In troth, Signiours, I meant it not. Cass. 'Twas too much you said it, Sir. Bent. Doe but conceale mee.â Cass. Then you'le confesse, and bring us in as parties. Bent. May I be hang'd if I doe; besides, what ever secret disease you have about you, I'le cure you gratis. Grut. And thinke no more of poysoning them, that brought the musitians to your window; 'twas our plot Sir. Bent. I forgive you, and pray Gentlemen use mee for your Physitian when ever the state of your bodies requires it. I'le learne secrecie of you. Both. Agreed. Exit Bent. Cass.

Indeed I lov'd her once, Till I enjoy'd her, but she's lost, so is her memory; I've higher thoughts now; Charintha is my aime, Ferrando's niece; next heire to the Crowne; Mine by his promise: can I but divorce Valenzo from her love, together with His life, I'me safe; 'tis that I am contriving: He is my rivall both in a Mistresse, and A Princes favour.âWho waits within there? ho.

'Tis well, if this slander can but pull on murder upon him, or any of my servants, from Valenzo's hand, his head shall answer for't; I am his judge. (My power over the King makes mee so:) And he shall find mee cruell; then the fort is mine, In which his souldiers are in garrison; This night the French, and Geno wayes intend To ceize our emptie fleete, that rides i'th harbour; Those men I have indear'd,â Mount, mount my soule, let no feare weigh thee downe, He stakes his life that thus casts at a Crowne.

Faith so I shall, as often as I am dispos'd to laugh. Cal. No matter though, Ferrando, now I consider better on't. you shall not, you'd not do it well; do't to'th life, I'le not give a pin for't else: let me alone for one, I'de act that same Kings daughter, I can command a teare or two: if need bee, perhaps a sigh; if'twere to rave, or grow starke mad, I should learne too: alas these playes are pretty moralls of our lives; fine, harmelesse, innocent sports. Val. Her madnesse growes strongly upon her. Syl. But Madame, pray what part shall I act? Cal. Thou Sylvio?âth'art a pretty boy, but that thou weep'st so much; I feare th'ast spoyl'd thy face; with a little paint 'twould serve turn: thou shalt act some Lady in disguise. aside. Syl. How truly do I doe it? Cal. One that has beene in love. Syl. I should do that scurvily. Cal. Why? Syl. Because I can love none but you, and would be loath to dissemble, though but in jest. Cal. Come thou shal't not then; thou shalt be my page still. Syl. Indeed Madame I should dye if I were otherwise: But pray, when will you be well? you have bin sicke a great while. Cal. Yes, and shall be so till I am dead; say nothing Sylvio, I'le steale away from them, when they shall not know of't. Syl. Not alone, I'le dye with you, and be buried with you if you will give mee leave. Cal. Ferrando, you will see it done? Fer. What Madame? Cal. See us both buried, laid by my Father, he was a good, good King: build us a tombe as lasting as our names. Bent. A very rich one Madame; I'le ensure you they're about it, with stately columnes, curious antickes, &amp; glorious imagery. Cal. There, let us both be cut in spotlesse marble, It never shall upbraid us, we were innocent as that; But innocence is no guard, it could not keepe The tyrant out: my father's, let his be cut Just as he fell, make a sword pierce his heart, And let it bleed too, yet don't hurt the Statua, I would not have you wound it, when 'tis like My Father, like a King, lest hee that do's it, Learne thence to be a traitour, and in time Wound you so too, Ferrando. Fer. Mercy good heavens! Cal. Pray why do'e weepe? wee shall all sleepe quietly When we are dead, there is no noyse of chaines, We shall not dreame of prisons, rackes or whips: But every night shall see the Gods descend On our soft slumbers, and kisse away our miseries: Ladies, you'le see mee shrowded decently, When I am dead, downe in the meade yon, where Grimme Pluto stole his Proserpine, are still The flowers she scatter'd: goe, bring 'em hither, And strew me ore with 'em; she was a virgin chast, And I have heard that flowers of their gathering, will never dye; quickly make hast, 'tis said we're very noysome after death, I would not Offend then, cause I can't aske forgivenesse: Before I die I'le breake my heart, and give A piece to every one to weare in's bosome, And you shall have it whole, Ferrando: pray Use it as you would her you lov'd, while I To quit these miseries will go pray, and die.

I hope Ladies you have more wit than to die o'th sullens. Val. Griefe dares not be so rude, did you but checke it. Flor: Las Sir, our miseries have taught it insolence, Pier. Rather your owne indulgence, Madame. Val. Pleasure's the same in Naples as in Sicily. Viol: So are our losses too. Val. The eyes sad flux is tributary due Unto your dead Lords memories, I confesse it, It carries vertue in't, but how? whilst it is moderate Alp. Pish, let the dead care for themselves: Did you but see how ugly sorrow lookes.â Pier. And then how fruitlesse. Flor. Yes, where 'tis false, but wee Have griefe as reall as our misery. Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter Alphon: &amp; Fungoso. Alp. Fun, thy judgement Fun, what think'st thou of these Ladies? Fun. In my judgement, (since your Lordship is pleas'd to make use of my judgement,) which indeed (my good Lord) is very small. Alph. I perceive thou hast one good qualitie, thou wilt speake truth. Fun. Truth (my Lord) is precious; but I say in that little judgement I have: (judgement, (since your Lordship was pleas'd to terme it so) but that's all one,) in my minde they'r mightily taken;â Alph. With what? Fun. A passion (my good Lord,) which the learned call griefe. Alph. Thy judgement against any mans in Naples. Fung: My Lord, I praise not my selfe, yet I can prove by this that they are in love. Alp: As how? Fung. Griefe alwayes followes love; if griefe follow love, love go's before, ergo, they're in love. Alph: So, suppose nowâ Fun: (My good Lord) I doe suppose. Alph. What? Fung: Even what your Lordship pleases. Alph. Suppose then, any of 'em should be in love with mee, would you?â Fun. Yes my Lord. Alph. What? Fun. Any thing.â Alp: Bring her to my chamber. Fun: âBut pimpe, it will contaminate.â Alp. A fooles head, will it not? I say you shall bring her.

So, this becomes youâ Fer: I have shooke off all Those weights that clogg'd my bosomeâWee can smile, Shewes it not handsome? Urs. Such a smile nere blest The cheekes of Peace. Fer: How art thou lost Ursini! Discredited to truth by this vile flattery! Thou shouldst have said, heaven smil'd, when set with clouds Blacke as nights swarthy mantle, when the aire Breakes out in hideous crackes, that cleave the Temple, And strike dead the devout Priest at the Altar: For this an easie faith would have beleev'd, As having lesse of contradiction in't: My soule is rapt with furies, here they gnaw, Like knotted Adders wrapt about my heart. Oh! my sides swell as they would breake, they want A hoope, lend mee your arme,â Urs: Circled in these Embraces, you are safe: collect your selfe (Deare Prince;) and let not passion triumph in The conquest of your reason; thinke of your honour, Your name, and spreading glories; how they dye. Fer. I'me blacke and ugly; all A whole staine already: Oh Calantha, Thou goest to heaven, to tell Ferrando kill'd thee; And those blest troopes of Saints will wreake thy murder; There's not one but suffers in't. Urs. âThe King! Helpe hereâOh! Bentivoglio, come, Enter Bent. Come practice here, and raise your selfe a trophey In his recovery. Bent. Whence this sudden fit?âMy Lord Ferrando: Fer. Oh Calantha. Bent. She lives, Calantha lives. Fer: What breath is that, that mockes us With a false sound of our Calantha's life? She lives; yet let old time adde to his age But one short paire of minutes, shee shall be No more: Bent. No more distracted: next houre shall render Calantha to your bosome faire, and well; As rich in all the ornaments of minde, As when she first blest Naples with her presence. Fer. Truth's but a name: 'tis false, by heaven 'tis false; Did not I leave her sunke upon her bed, Into a soft, but everlasting sleepe? Bent. So you suppos'd; and I have caus'd her women To wrap her in her shrowd, then sit downe by her, To weepe, and pray, as if 'twere for the dead. Fer. As if?âabuse mee not, thy art Shall be no priviledge; she's gone, she's gone. Urs. Ben't so passionate; but heare him. Fer. Ursini, I have done. Bent. After a strict enquiry into the nature Of her disease, I finde it by each symptome, A melancholy deepe, not dangerous: The parents which produc't it, griefe and abstinence From meate, and sleepe; which as it hath encrea'st, Has brought her now to such an extreame dotage, That she do's verily suppose her selfe, While living dead: In which false supposition I've caus'd her women to continue her, By shrowding her to her owne desire, Strewing her o're with flowers, then weeping o're her Fer: What helpe from this? Beut: Much Sir, this will worke her Into a strong opinion, that shee's dead Indeed, to confirme which I have prepar'd Some two or three, trick't up in the same fashion With shrowdes, and chaplets, who shall sit downe by her, Walke, talke, eate, drinke, sleepe, in all which actions Calantha will streight imitate them: Now I have prepar'd A potion which they shall give her, To make her sleepe, the onely remedy Of her disease; this I lately practis'd in the French Court, Yet lost no credit by the experiment. Urs. You may beleeve him Sir, he's one of the skilfullest Physitians our age has boasted of, Padua is proud of such an ornament. Fer: Thus my Virginio. My best, my dear'st Virginio: thou dost breath A musicke to my soule, cures my distemper: Thou art an honest man, we'le found a Colledge, With a large pension to maintaine the Students In thy rare science; thou shalt governe there, And when thou dyest, we'le build a monument Unto thy name, taller than Ãgypts Pyramides. Bent: These are your Court promises, I'le onely studie some revenge, for yon old Lord, (aside. Then I'le returne to'th Universitie, &amp; dream on 'em. Fer: For thee Ursini, we will onely live Exit Bent. To do thee honour, that shall be our glory; The world shall know thee great, and envie thee Thy share, both in our kingdome, and our soule. Urs. Your goodnesse, my Lord, is as unlimited As heavens. Fer. You're sad Ursini: has our Niece Given you no cause of joy, by her soft answer? Urs. None.â Fer. The obstacle? tell mee; ift' be any in Court she affects, by my honour I'le remove him. Urs. None but this, that she's too much wedded to Heaven, and her devotions. Fer. If that be all, shee's thine. Urs. A blisse, I would for ever live t'enjoy.â Enter Zisco. whispers Ursini. With mee?â Fer. What would that Moore? Urs. He has letters here from his holinesse, In which I'me certifi'd, that he lately turn'd Christian, And has well deserv'd i'th warres, Against the Turke;âThe King admits you to His hand. Zis. I am in heaven too soone. Fer. We'le view his holinesse commendations, Then heare this Moore, discourse the fight at large; My griefes begin to vanish; they'r much lighter Than of late they were, I know not why, But 'tis a good presage. Urs. Be neere us. Exeunt, Fer. Ursini. Zis. Thus farre I'me safe, heaven is just, and smiles On my designe, now all that's powerfull To move my spirits, to incite revenge Appeare, if not to sight, to memory; Alberto: father: and my deare, deare sister, Poore lost Felicia!âHa! he groanes, I heare him; Shee sighs poore maid, wrings her hands, cries alas, Looke, looke I see 'em, there, there, sacred shadesâ Vanish't, and I'me deluded; no they'r angry At my delay: I'le hast,âfor that revenge must needs be just Which punishes two sinnes, murder, and lust.

Merc: Happy soules that hither come To enjoy Elizium; Rob'd of bodies though you be, Y' are richer by such poverty; For with them y'have put off paine, Making of your losse, your gaine: Now your soules may meete and kisse, Bathing in eternall blisse; Nor can you surfeit, each delight Whets, and quiets appetite; Yet the joyes you feed upon Ne're encrease, nor ere are done; Freely you may taste, and spend 'em, Yet nor you, nor time can end 'em: Where without a fading ray. Yee enjoy eternall day, Trace these groves, whose every path Myriads of true lovers hath; Where disporting, you may prove A new, but happier, purer love: Such, whose flames, though th'ever shine Yet consume not, but refine. Exit Mer: Having thus finish't, the Ghosts joyn with Calantha in some solemne measures; which ended, a banquet is serv'd in, they sit downe, and invite Calantha, to the same, who willingly accompanies them, and as shee prepares to drinke, they put an Opiate cup in her hand; shee drinkes, and suddenly fals asleepe; they betweene them carry her out. &amp;c. SCEN. V. Valenzo, Piero, Charintha. Val. I am too tame Piero, hold mee not, Lest in deferring of a punishment, I make the sinne mine owne; had all malice Dwel't in one tongue, all slander too beene hous'd Under the same roofe with it, and both busie To plot the ruine of my owne faire name; I could have stood unmov'd: but my Charintha! Heavens! ye ought t'inspire me with revenge, Such as you'd call a Synode to contrive, That I may meete this hell-borne ravisher Of my Charintha's spotlesse fame, with vengeance As mighty as his crime. Pier. Her vertue is It selfe an antidote against all such poysons; His breath no more can staine that innocent whitenesse, Which ever dwell't upon her soule, than hee, That in a fond maliciousnesse would throw Dirt at the Sunne, could sulley the least ray; Her memory, when hee, and's lying marble Consume to dust, and rottennesse, shall dwell On earth like a perfume, after the sacrifice, Pleasing to God, and men. Char: If I have us'd Any immodest braveries, appear'd In wanton gaudinesse, a hot temptation To 'th youthfull flowings of the blood; If I have entertain'd one looser thought But such as Chastitie's cold votaries, When they breath out a soule into her bosome, Might safely nourish; if I've misemploy'd One houre, in which with strict endeavour, I Might have gain'd somewhat to my stocke of vertue, (The onely dower I'de meete your love withall,) May I be guilty of that sinne, my honour, My virgin honour's blasted with, and die A loath'd Apostate. Val. Now you grieve, I suffer double; Forgive mee Lady, I have wrong'd you, and Onely I. Char. Mocke not my teares, they are holy. Val. I, that to purchase fame, and idle breath, Could venter forth abroad into the world, And leave thee here a prey to ravenous wolves; Expose the tender yeares of a weake virgin To labour 'gainst the furious tyde of lust That has assaulted thee; that my low birth Should stand in need of such additions, To raise mee to a height, might equall yours: That vertue and not blood ennobled us, This then had never hap'ned. Char. Greatnesse transmitted Has lesser of Divinity; your honours Are vertues purchase, and your owne deservings. Valenzo thou return'st in glorious triumph, Rich, from the conquest of a noble foe, And yet not laden with the gaudy spoyle So much, as with the valour of the enemy: As if th'ad'st envy'd them their vertue onely, And sought'st to rob 'em of it; all for mee:â Val: I've wav'd a plume, dight mee i'th warlike garbe, Manag'd a sword, or shooke a dreaded speare, Look't terrible, bin pittilesse to those That begg'd a life, revell'd in citties sack't, And rifled tents: too poore and triviall matters To point at such rich ends as thee, (my love.) Thy blood runnes high, there's not one purple streame Cas'd in these azure veines, but is deriv'd From'th spring of Princely ancestry, and th'art The wealthy storehouse of their fortunes too. Char. 'Las! what are these, but what the owner makes them? Of themselves nothing, only as we use them, Are good or bad, a blessing or a curse: Val. But then their vertues, by a thriftie providence, Are all summ'd up in thy blest selfe, and make thee A happinesse which if injoy'd must bee Bestow'd by gift, because above all purchase. Char: No (my Valenzo,) vertue's ravish't hence, Charintha's strumpetted, her name is rank't I'th vulgar breath, 'mongst common prostitutes; Pardon, (my love) shall't never wed thy shame, Thy jealousie. Val.

What meanes Valenzo? Val. Perhaps report has injur'd mee, and noys'd That I was jealous of Charintha's love; And you contriv'd this plot to make mee hate you; Or, if you should repent, (as well you may.) Your favours so ill plac't, upon a subject So poore and worthlesse; take 'em backe againe, Live happy in a better choyce, Charintha. (Pardon my love, shall't never wed thy shame.) Char.

Syl: Those are favours Sir, That become them to give, not me to take. Urs: Thou hast deserv'd them boy, Calantha speakes thee A miracle of love and piety; Is passionate in thy praise, all to win Affection from the Prince to thee, dry up Those teares; which till this time did never flow Offensive unto any: This day is consecrate to mirth and Hymen, 'Tis sinne to weare a frowne, or folded brow; For every smile, thou lend'st them now, they'l pay A thousand backe againe: Exit.

Come my Calantha, to consummate those joyes, By mutuall vowes before the Altar made, Which thy returne to life, to health, and reason, Hath begun in me; those minutes which bring Us any good, are swift and fleeting, and Once past not to be recall'd, who knowes Whether heaven will still be bountifull; Cal. Or smile upon this hasty Union: Fer. Yes royall mayde, they have prepar'd thee for it, By the addition of new warmth and strength: Cal. For more sorrowes; pray let's backe, this day (There's something whispers to me) will prove fatall. Fer. Ursini, see she weepes! I've tooke thee from a sea of teares, (my Venus) And thou art dropping dropping wet yet. Syl. 'Tis ominous, this might have bin my marriage day; But heaven forgive, and prosper him. (aside Fer. Create a Sun-shine, With thine owne smiles thou mayst, and dry thee in't: Let the dull Negro dive to fetch thee Jewells, These scatter'd seedes of pearle, are all too rich And pompous for ornament; the least of these Thy fond neglect has dropt, would purchase heaven. Cal. Blame not my pious thrift, I shed them for't; Thither my journey tends, I shortly shall arrive there. Fer. Thou yeeldst too much to passion! Cal. These rites, (If we may credit what our dreames fore-tell,) Will turne to funerall obsequies, for such This morning, (when your carefull art had bound My senses up) fancy presented 'em. Methought I saw, Aurora from the East come weeping up, Wrapt in nights sables, and the following day Pac't slowly on, in griefes sad livery; The pensive windes sigh'd forth a solemne dirge, And strove to blow our marriage tapers out; When you Ursini joyn'd in the solemnitie, I saw you looke, like Sicily's pale ghost, Broke from the hollow Caverns of the earth; This hand Ferrando, at each gentle touch Mouldred to ashes; on your lip there sate A frost, which when I tasted straight convey'd An icy chilnesse thorough every joynt; The stammering Priest methought mistooke the rites, And stead of those are us'd at nuptialls. Sung a short requiem to our soules, committed All that was left of us, to the earth, our last Cold bed. Alph. I warrant you Ladies, this was because she lay alone; you should advise her better. Urs. 'Twas the intemperance of your disease Suggested these ChimÃ¦ra's. Fer. And with it they are fled. Cal. No, no Ferrando; I've sinn'd against my fathers ghost; ere yet His royall corps had slept two silent Moones I'th' peacefull earth, or ere I had payd downe Just tribute of my teares, I've chang'd my sables For a gay nuptiall garment, whose light out-side Denotes the loosenesse of a lighter minde, To which griefe should have bin perpetuall guest. Fer. Urge it no more, thy misery's Virgin Queene Are powerfull with me, and have taught this breast A sad repentance. Cal. Canst thou Ferrando then repent? Fer. I can, that I have wrong'd thy innocence, Kill'd thy father. Cal. O take me to thy soule, wee'l mingle sighs, And teares, which still shall flow together from us, As if the motion were but one; and those So frequent, that the stones, which cloth his dust, Shall soften into turfe, from whence shall spring A bed of flowers, creeping about the grave, As if they'd strew themselves upon him, then Wither, that men might thinke we wept for them. Fer. Yet pardon Love, when ever I remember He was a Prince, a Prince of equall power, And strength with him he wrong'd; that he once stood A barre betwixt our loves, or rather mockt Our hopes of mutuall enjoyment; that For his owne peevish humour, he would ruine The edifice, that we had built to honour, I glory in the act. Cal. Take pitty on me courteous death! My thoughts are growne more terrible then thou! I am monstrous, a prodigy in nature, one with Him, that was my fathers murderer. Fer. Royall my Queene. 'Tis the excesse of pietie, The errour of your duty, that thus wrongs The justice of my cause. Cal. Yet you might have spar'd His life, and made it your just praise, that you Could conquer, and not kill: Fer. He was so eager in the pursuite of the foe, When first he routed us, that willingly He ran upon my sword, that stood t'oppose His haste, and met a death instead of victory. Urs. Nay rather we may fay, that he met both Who triumphs over life, and all the misery's That too officiously attend upon it; Crowne his pale statua, with victorious wreaths, And call his unkinde fate, his happinesse! His fall was honourable, Kings like other men Travell to death, they goe i'th' common roade, Are in their end as sensible of paine As the base peasants, whom they by and by I'th' grave are equall with; their only priviledge Is in their executioner, who would not rather Fall under a Kings hand, than yeeld his life Up to a weake disease, a Feaver, Gout, Or grating Stone, which had he mist this stroke, Might streight have seiz'd him; and have rob'd him of The glory of his end? Cal. I cannot yeeld So farre to reason, but I still must looke Upon you, as an enemy to Sicily; As him that kill'd my father, and so hate you; Yet I must love you too: when first we met Together in your Tent, both arm'd (you know) I would have fought, nay, and have kill'd you too, (Could skill or strength have done it, some I had Of both;) yet I meant not to survive you, Nor should I neede t'have made another wound To let mine owne life out, I'de dyed with yours. Fer: Ursini thou must quit some interest in my love, Calanthaâ Urs: Deserves it all; 'Twere a sinne no lesse than sacriledge, To rob her o'th least part of your affections. Fer: My faculties are growne All to one power, call'd love and you engrosse it Whole to your selfe; yet leave it still entire To my Calantha, 'tis a divers flame, That burnes mee, yet but one, each takes it's difference, And being from the object, be you still My friend, &amp; thou my love, whom when we have once joyn'd Unto our amorous folds, thus we will move And of our armes make a new spheare for love.

Urs: The Priest has done his office, all delights The married have a priviledge in, are yours: Be bold in the enjoyment, what ere while Was term'd a loosenesse in desire, is now A vertuous thought: those flames which cloth your Soules Are chast and holy, dalliance is your devotion. Fer. Yet you my Royall faire, can weare mee at A carefull distance, tremble at each touch Of hand or lip, as if you fear'd a rape: âDisplay this beauteous treasure, lovely sweete And let these flowers which dwell upon thy cheeke, Like those proud Maja weares, i'th smiling ides Blaze wide and openâsee! they are fresh and lively, Their odour flies to heaven in sacrifice! kissing her.

Flo: Good my Lord! you will too much indeare us to you with your courtesies. Viol: And being strangers we are apt to be traduc't: Our good names are precious, they are all we have left Unconquer'd. Urs: Hymen applaud's this early piety: The doves that drive the chariot of loves Queene, Are swift in motion, and those happy troopes, Which waite upon her triumphs, mak't their strife Which shall out-runne the other, those that lagge Cupid will whip with roses to the Altar. Cal: Henceforth (my Lord) I must attend your will, Let me but drop a teare or two upon My father's dust, and with his memory I'le bid farewell to griefe. Urs. This vault containes it. Fer: Let us pay our last duties. Urs. The Quire attends without. A Tombe discovered: &amp;c. Song within. Chor: Noblest bodies are but guilded clay; put away But the precious shining rinde; The inmost rottennesse remaines behind. 1. Kings, on earth though gods they be, Yet in death are vile as we; He, a thousands King before, Now is vassall unto more. 2. Vermine now insulting lye, And dig for Diamonds in each eye; Whil'st the scepter bearing hand Cannot their inroades withstand. 3. Here doth one in odours wade By the regall unction made, While another dares to gnaw On that tongue, his peoples law. Chor: Fooles! ah fooles are we, who so contrive, And do strive, In each gaudy ornament, Who shall his corps in the best dish present. Fer: 'Tis well; enough is wept for Sicily; cheare up, We have other vowes to pay, and as religious ones As these: we made them at the Altar; and If we performe them not, shall forfeit all Our after joyes:âremove those objects there; We have no use of sables now; they breed Melancholy thoughts; we will be loud, And big in mirth, as full of pride as noyse, Till wee draw envie on our revels; which Nor fate, nor the dull stoicke shall controule, Whose sullen faith is the disease of's soule.

Onely poore I am sillier than these; Witnesse th'untimely swelling of this wombe Pregnant to my disgrace;âAs I lay hid In yonder thicket, the brambles gently swell'd, And hid my shame, which yet each triviall winde But dallying with, perswaded from my covert!

When first I saw Your person, and how mutually you lov'd, Knowing how farre I was beneath your worth, So deare I held you both, that I determin'd For ever to be lost to memory; And serve you thus in this disguise: which I Had done, but that this haplesse chance Betray'd mee to your knowledge.

Methinkes wee two now seeme to be set copies Of griefes, to which wrong'd virgins will repaire, To take out patternes by. Syl. Our wrongs and sorrowes Have made us just so like to one another, That each seemes th'others counterfeit. Cal.

Cal: What though, wrong'd innocence? In death it will intitle us to honours; And though our bodies moulder to corruption; Our better part shall survive fame; our names, Free from decay, shall swell up numerous volumes; Whil'st our sad legends shall be made a pillow, To every sleeping virgin. Syl: O yet for my sake have some pitty on him, And for that part of him, that's cradled here, 'Las he may live to make us faire amends. Cal: For thy sake I could spare him, but my wrongs Sit heavy here, and urge mee to revenge. Syl: But say I've thought a way, how we may yet Be both restor'd to happinesse, would you not Accept, and follow't? Cal: Speake it (gentle soule.) Syl: As yet (you know) your virgin treasure stands Free from his ruder touch: those Ceremonies, Which link't you in one Hymeneall knot, Religion will make void, the prÃ¦contract 'Twixt him and mee being knowne, so that you then, On this part are free from him; enjoy him thus You cannot, neither would you (I suppose) After these wrongs, (if you might be permitted:) What hinders then, but that I take your place This night? and shew him, to what height his perjury Has wrought our wrongs, whilst you in some disguise May quit the Court, and e're next Sun appeare, From hence towards France, to whom you are allyed In blood, and wrongs.â Cal: Content,âI'le in, and haste mee to be gone, To goe there is some hope.

Pier: Justice requires but one, her fate Is so involv'd in yours, you cannot fall, But in it shee must finde a certaine death; Thinke then, how can you satisfie the law? Val. Farre easier than you, in whose sad losse The whole world suffers, and in thy unripe fall Looses all goodnesse. Char: Stint this pious strife, I have bin too much woman, and betrai'd My name to infamy, in this tame passion: Possesse mee a just anger, a spirit great And noble as my birth; that I may shake, And rowze this sleepy Prince, from his dull lethargie; Who's wholy lost, in the bewitching flatteries Of that bad man;âalas this is a danger Too potent for your starres to free you from; Henceforth I'le be your destinies: for since This calme brings nothing but a certaine fall, A storme shall either save, or ruine all. (Exeunt.) SCEN. III. Ferrando. Ursini. Charintha. A Table is set forth; taper, pen, inke, &amp;c. Fer. âContemne our pardon. Urs. Returne your favours too With so much scorne. Fer: Better they'd play'd with lightning, Or hugg'd a thunderbolt. Urs: Justice is slow Of pace, and if not led by furie, Seldome o'retakes the crime, let your returne Of punishment be quicke, and active, delay is worse Than pitty, and more dangerous: Valenzo Is popular, and who knowes, but hee had rather, Owe his life to the peoples mutiny, than your pardon, And therefore slighted it. Fer: Oh the state of Princes! How farre are we from that securitie, Wee dream't of in th'expectance of our crowne? Were forraine dangers nothing, yet we nourish Our ruine in our bosome: Valenzo is a traytour, So is Piero too; and who is not in this age? It is unsafe not to suspect our selfe. To torture with 'em; be noble in thy justice:â Here draw a warrant for their execution;â We'le sign't with our owne signe;âhence pitty, Post from our breast; we banish thee our bosome Th'art a disease bred there to ruine Majestie: And sink us below our subjects scorne.â Ursini preparing to write. Charintha? (Enter Charintha.) Our Princely cousin, welcome to Court; thou hast Beene too long absent, (I must chide thee for't,) And envy'd us the boast of vertue. Char: Vertue! Urs. Some malicious devill now, or other, Has intic'd her from her beads; To undoe mee, and my plots, shee carries anger In her brow:âthis I must mitigate, or I am Lost.â Fer: Thou art so eager after heaven, Thou woo't o're-buy thy happinesse. Char: Never fear't Sir. Fer: But thy devotion's season'd with so much charity, Thou pil'st a stocke of merit up for us At Court. Char: I beleeve y'had need on't. Fer: As long as we live here we shall;â Char: So wicked! Fer: Ha! what frowne's that, whence these clouds, Charintha? So rises the blushing morne, as thou wert wont To smile, when thou appear'dst, we owe Our day unto thy eyes; and if thou think'st Thy beautie's worne too cheape, we'le become tributaries To thee for light; chase hence this fullen darknesse, Thy absence has already made too long A night. Char: No Sir; 'twas your blacke deeds: Fer. How's this? Do'e know mee, who I am? Char: Not well. Fer: Your King. Char: A Tyrant Of bigge, and glorious impieties, A regall monster, the true head of that Beast you rule, the multitude: more cruell Than enrag'd lyons, or robb'd beares; who both Will spare the innocent, and humble. Fer: Looke to'th Lady there, sure she's distracted. Char: My wrongs indeed would make mee so. Fer: What wrongs? whence? or from whom? Char. Raise not my anger higher with your scorne;â Fer. By all that's.â Char. Or if't be ignorance of my sufferings, It but betrayes your want of reason, and How farre you're lost to man, by your fond dotage. Fer. Grow more particular, or wonder ruines mee. Char. Good God! I've suffer'd so long, till patience Grew my greatest crime.â Urs. Now, now the storme is coming this way, But I'me prepar'd to meete it. Char. Whence? or from whom? Aske this good man how often he has mourn'd Over the ruines of my fame? how often His eares have met with the report of my Disgrace? how I was noys'd a strumpet? when Each talking thing at Court, might freely act A rape upon my vertue, till I was left All a whole staine, blacke as the front of perjur'd Sinners? while you, (as if I'de bin a trifle Cast from your blood, and kindred, or some darke thing, Whose actions were so fowly bad, That report better'd 'em in the expression:) Could sit as silent as the night; as calme As seas, when the windes sleepe; yet at last be just; And say, how have I appear'd to you, or him, That calumnie has thus bin priviledg'd, To violate my honour? Urs. Madame, I have allwayes spoke you, chastities best example. Fer: Innocence it selfe is not so white. Char. Yet he that would confirme this with his sword, Must meete, with prisons, wrackes, and tortures, As a reward of so much vertue! Fer. Ha! Urs. Sweetest Princesse!â Char: And ere he die, must suffer in's honour, Be proclaim'd traytor to the state: Fer: Ursini, thou hast abus'd our trust. Urs. My Lord.â Char: Too weake pretence, for your ingratitude To so large merit; Naples call's him Her chiefe preserver; he brought home victory, By his owne arme atchiev'd, when the proud foe, Threatned your Kingdome with a fatall downefall. He, to whose arme you owe your life, your crowne, To whom in warre, you'd sooner flie for helpe Then to the Altar; now in peace must have His temples robb'd; his garlands from his brow Transplanted. to adorne this uselesse statua. Urs. Madame, I have not so appear'd in managing these affaires of yours. Char. Would thou had'st, Or somewhat that carries lesse resemblance Of man: Oh thou art bravely wicked. Urs. I have not us'd the art to boast the vertue Of mine owne actions; yet heaven knowes They were all good, and aim'd at ends as honourable As your desires. Fer. Ursini leave, till there is hope of pardon, This impudence in sinne, Bid's a defiance to all mercy; did we not, At your perswasion, give order for Valenzo's Quicke dispatch? Urs: How ere I seem'd (great Sir) to runne downe with the streame of your violent passion, yet my intents still bore up against it; witnesse this paper. Fer: Ha! What's here a pardon? Deliver's a paper to Ferrando, who reades it. Urs: Which you had seal'd ere this, had not this Lady here interrupted it. Fer. How? Urs: your passion would not have permitted you, To have o're view'd what you consented too; This I knew, as likewise how dangerous it. Would have beene to the state, if he had fall'n. Fer: Againe my owne Ursini:â Charintha, pardon our errours, we will deserve it, By the future love, and honours we will throw On our Valenzo,âhere take my signet Fetch 'em to Court. Char: You are noble. Fer: Ursini Waite on her to the Castle. Urs. You honour mee. Fer. Oh how neere were we destruction.

Gal. Our deserts, my Lord, Are so slender, that wer't not to prejudice Your judgement, we would blush to owne any. Cont. Hang this flattery, merit quotha? is't such a piece of merit to cut a score or two of throats; knocke downe an hundred o'th citty herd? a gallant could do so much for's Cockatrice. Val: The King shall give you each particular thankes: He owes you both a trophey, Gal. His acknowledgement Of our duty, would raise our pride to sinne, We should forget to let heaven share i'th victory. Cont: Victories, by Mars's crest it deserves not to come i'th Chronicle, though Hollinshead or Hall, those voluminous forreiners should write our annals, 'twill ne're make us justle in among the CÃ¦sars, or owne a name i'th list o'th worthies.

Val: In Parian marble, wee'le rob the Quarries To reare thee up a glorious monument. Cont. A glorious loame to set lazie spiders a worke in, an office for birds to mute in, if these be your glorious monum?ts for men of armes, I'le e'en live to sin out my merit (as you call it) then when I die, the world and I will shake hands, and cry quit of all sides.

GonÃ§alesâI gratulate thy navall victory; France will have cause hereafter to mention thee in sad story, Thou giv'st them but a churlish salutation. Gon. Such as they deserv'd, It seemes they came rather to steale than fight, They were as ill prepar'd, as they had meant To beare our empty hulkes away unquestion'd; For soone as they perceived we descri'd 'em, Pale, as the lillies in their trembling flagges, They turn'd their sailes, and fled; we made after 'em, With swift wing'd lightning from our Canons mouth, Which sunke and fir'd 'em all, ere they could quit The channell, or gaine the wider Ocean; Val. Beleeve mee, noble Souldier, thou art deare To fame; as old in victory, as in yeares, Yet still thou toyl'st t'undoe thy selfe, and benefit Thy ingratefull soyle, which never will be able To requite thy meanest service. Gon: Yet you for the same cause, i'th pride of youth, Oppos'd your selfe betwixt the state and danger, When their sicke hopes, were as their fortunes, desperate; Reduc'd a Kingdome to your sway, in whose Rich spoyles, your gawdie Souldier triumphs; Whilst boasting of their rifled plumes, they drinke Health's to victory; yet those so moderate, Their bowles encrease their fury, not their surfeits. Cont. How these tall men o'th sword claw one another? Gal: They have an itch of pride runnes through 'em. Val.

Ha! what meanes this flight? Cal. Dare none of you fight? Val. Deare Lady, not with you. Cal, Then you are cowards, they speake you so i'th Citty, And I came out thus purposely to try you. Val.

Flor: But Madame, why do'e desire us to leave you? Fear you not his fury, what it may prompt him too, When he shall see you are not his Calantha. Fel. He never was acquainted with that passion, He's violent in nothing,âBut in love. Viol. And yet he may dissemble that too As well as his vowes. Fel. Should hee? were his hand Lift up to strike mee, I can charme it there! Who can looke on a Ladies bended knees, Wet cheekes, swolne eyes, heare her sighs, her prayers, And yet be cruell: If there be one that can, That one is not Ferrando; his bosome is Passable to every grone; it strikes his heart: He would tell mee (when he was absent) If I sigh't, or wept, for then he said He wept and sigh'd by sympathy. Viol. Yet now he loves you not. Fel: Can hee not love himselfe? here, here I beare him, Himselfe in a lesse modell, this I'le shew him, If he mistrust t'is none of his; let him But rip mee up, there he shall see each limbe As like to his, as his one hand, one eye, One cheeke is like the other: besides there lyes Folded by his owne name, he told mee hee Would call it so, (Ferrando,) and lest I Should chance forget, I wrote it in my heart, There he will finde it.

Fer: I'le tell him too how hee Would grieve if I were dead, goe hanging downe His head, vailing his eyes from heaven, asham'd To looke up to the place, where his Felicia is: Or poring on the ground, as he would finde Where my neglected ashes lay a sport To th'windes; where some rude blast might blow mee up Into his eyes, and then hee'd weepe to finde, Mee there; weepe till the fretting brine had burn'd His eye-bals out. He told mee of his dreames, what pleasure hee Had to finde me in 'em: alas they will Be terrible now: I shall affright him, appeare A thin pale ghost, make him start out in his sleepe; (Alas!

Or the weake shine of triviall state dazle Their eyes that looke upon the blessed sunne! Could'st thou flatter thy selfe into such a Security, That vengeance would not finde thee out? When thou had'st surfeited thy luxurious palate With all the dainties of Felicia's body Thirsted her blood, quaff'd off whole bowles of it, Till thou wer't drunke, and wild with fury Of thy intemperate draughtsâAm not I a rare villaine now?

Cal: To curse thee false and perjur'd. Fer: The spheares are out of tune; nature's distraught; The orbes celestiall have turn'd round so long That they are giddie: the starres are in a mutiny, The Intelligences are altogether by'th eares. Cal: Heaven! I blesse your justice: Sterne tyrant! that triumph'st o're the memory Of my father, mock'st mee with love, Till like a foole I doated on my fetters, 'Cause they were golden ones, that thus Thy devillish art might make my soule a captive, With my body. Fer. Ãnigmaticall. Cal: Yet then a Lady mourn'd thy perjur'd vowes, Whom thou betrayd'st to loose adultery. Fer: Thy speech, Calantha, is darker than an Oracle. Cal: Truer it is, and dar'st thou yet dissemble it? 'Tis a truth precious to time, who will preserv't To blast thy memory, and derive a staine On all thy successours. Urs., Zis. How? or when arriv'd this your knowledge Madame? Cal: Felicia told mee all her selfe Confirm'd it by religious oathes; besides This medall which she gave mee from her necke, A pledge of his broke faith, with the sad fruits Of his sate lust, within her wombe. Fer: She's a blacke whore: shee lies; beleeve her not. Cal. Thou wilt be damn'd: Fer. So may I; and houle eternally In those blew flames the devils bath in, If ever my vowes were made to any other Then thee; and those, as spotlesse as thy soule.â Urs: But whom have wee here? Cal. Felicia! Sad Lady she intreated This night's exchange of place; that she might shew him What an untimely mother he had made her, And this 'twas caus'd my flight. Fer: Felicia! Cal: Ha! murder'd. Urs. My love. Zis. My sister! ravish't: And murder'd by! mee, incestuous villaine! Urs. Didst thou not tell mee that Ferrando ravish't her, And cast her to his slaves, a prey to their Bold appetites and furies. Zis. To incense you the more against him; I told you What I onely did imagine, because at my returne From Sicily, report whisper'd hwisper'd her lost, Lost in the ruines of my Father, Which made mee thinke her murder'd. Urs: Ye Gods! I now acknowledge you supreame: Your power is mighty over our fond arts. Silly projectours we ensnare our selves! Whilst we spread nets for others. This braine has wrought all these sad plots, Calantha, take your Lord; who is as true, And holy in his vowes, as those blest Saints He invok't. Cal: And yet Felicia wrong'd? Urs.

That aggravates my crime, who wrought her into This false beliefe, for having long lov'd her, Without returne of mutuall flames, and at length Finding that the impediment was her fond Dotage upon the Prince; I determin'd, Rather than not to be possest of her, To part with faith and loyaltie, feign'd all My visits for him, courted her acceptation Of his love, which I so darkly brought about That she consenting to private meetings As oft as she expected the Prince, I my selfe fill'd her armes.â Gal: Then you conclude Ferrando innocent? Urs: In act, or thought. Zis: Felicia! sister! your brother Frederico call's; She's gon, cold, cold! and pale, and yet methinkes She smiles, looke up, Feliciaâ Cal. But how came it to passe she nere discry'd you? Urs. For reasons I then gave her: all our meetings Were in the night, and that i'th darke too, where I Dissembled so the Prince in voyce and gesture.â Cal. This agrees right with her relation: villaine thou haste undone mee. Urs. And my selfe too. Zisc. Death hangs upon her lids, 'tis eternall night with her. hoa, sister, stay, take mee along with you; I'le follow you. (Stabs himselfe.) Val. Pernicious traytour. Cal. Rage choakes my utterance:âgive mee your sword. Val., Gon. Our hearts and hands are yours: Cal. Ile be an age in killing thee, do'st tremble? Thou look'st like one of those thin frozen ghosts, That chattering lye on hils of thicke-ribb'd Ice, Come meete my fury. Urs. Here, here's my heart. Cal. I: I'le dig it out, And cast it to the hungry fiends. Zis: My strength decayes, I reele and totter like a crack't reed that leanes against the windes. Cal: Take your sword.â Urs: Madame. Cal: Take it I say. Val. You do him too much honour. Cal: Manag't with skill and strength, or thou affront'st My honour,âfaint-hearted! coward, I'le follow thee to hell. Urs. Mercy heavens!

Gon: You wore their cause upon your sword. Cal: 'Tis poore revenge this, can he not live againe? Start up from th'earth with life, and double strength? Wer't centupled I'de meete him:âbut oh my eyes! Looke here Valenzo: which is Prince, which subject. Which is my lov'd Ferrando? I see there is No ceremonious state, no pompe in death; They all lye levell, all quiet, the bad as well As the good, why should this traytour here This divellish arch, arch-traytour lye as silent As his Lord? should he not stare, 'and foame, Start up and howle, till he wakes all the dead? Val: Lady: Gon: Her old passion returnes againe. Cal. âRoare, and curse heavens, But they too have forgot to punish sinners, And reward vertue, here's an example on't; We were both vertuous, and deserv'd not this Bad usage; let mee embrace thee:â Cold as the earth he lyes on, and as dull too: Where is the soule, that busie slame that lent Him life and motion? affected such vaine pompe And glorious noyse: whither is't fled? poore livelesse trunke, It was unkindly done to leave thee thus, A prey to wormes and rottennesse. Zis. Are you there fury, MegÃ¦ra, Tisiphone, Alecto, Howle, howle, furies, I'le lash you. Cal. Kind death th'art welcome; I kisse thy dart. Stabs Calantha, and dies. Gon. The Princesse! she's slaine, unluckie hand. Cal: Spight of our starres, and all rude opposition, We are one in death: Valenzo see us interr'd, Both in one tombe, that we may mingle ashes And be securely lodg'd, you know our soules Were one; our hearts were long united. Val. A Fatall Union. Cal: Draw, draw the curteines there, my love and I Must sleepe;âuncivill I protest, put out the lights, We shall sleepe best i'th darke; pray don't disturbe us, You may fright him from mine armes,âbutâI'leâholdâ himâfast. (dyes.) Val. The ruin'd treasure of two Kingdomes In one heape. (Enter Charintha, Piero, Violetta, Florinda, Alphonso. Char. In the bed-chamber! this way! Pier. Yes Lady, the cry was full of horrour. Viol: 'Twas the Physitians potion this my Lord. Flor: Done in revenge. Alph: Would 'thad bin poyson. Char: Blesse mee! whence all these tragedies. Pier: Astonishment ceizes mee. Alph. The King: Calantha: Ursini dead, ha! whom have we here, Frederico. Val. Yes, and Felicia too. Omnes. All slaine; by what dire hand? Val: I'le tell you that within.â Charintha is your Queene. Pier: May you be happy in her love. Val: Remove the bodies, i'th morning we will take order for the state, and funerall rites. Of these; the lasting story of whose wrongs Shall be all royall lovers evening songs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. After these ruines, thus your PoÃ«t stands, Expecting his owne destiny from your hands, By them he lives or dies; if it should hap That stead of a mild doome, applause or clap. (Your triviall allowance) his listening eares Meete with harsh whispers, or halfe stifled jeeres, Such unkinde censure kils him; his sad Muse Unlesse you give her bay, has vow'd to use The Cypresse wreathes, her pietie did allow Those onely to incircle her owne brow: Your candid acceptation will be New life and soule to his lost Poesie; His flame's but sicklie yet, your breath no doubt Will either blow't up higher, or quite out. FINIS.</field>
