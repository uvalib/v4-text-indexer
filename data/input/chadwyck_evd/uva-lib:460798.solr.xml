      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Stage at the Olympic Theatre. Enter Mr. and Mrs. Wigan, arm-in-arm. Mr. W. Well, come what may, at least behold us here! I hope you're satisfied? (to Mrs. Wigan) Mrs. W. So far, my dear, The house is ours. We've nothing now to do But— Mr. W. Fill it. Do you call that nothing, too? Mrs. W. Well, it's not much. The theatre is small, And Lord John Clapham said he'd take— Mr. W. A stall! Mrs. W. Well, love, that's one—and one— Mr. W. (checking her) “Friend,” you would say, “Makes many.” I devoutly wish it may, However, we are in for it, and so It's no use talking, we must act! Mrs. W. I know We must act, and I come resolved to play— Mr. W. All the best parts. Mrs. W. If they are in my way. Mr. W. And yours is such a taking way, my dear. Mrs. W. Come, Mr. Impudence, you needn't sneer, There was a time, to which I could allude— Mr. W. Nay, don't be angry. Mrs. W. Then don't you be rude. Mr. W. I'd not the least intention. Don't let's squabble But as you've got me into such a hobble— Mrs. W. I got you Mr. W. Well, no matter then, since we Have got into it, let us, pray, agree Upon some plan, at least, to get well out of it. You think we shall succeed? Mrs. W. I've not a doubt of it! Mr. W. Bless the dear women! they're such sanguine souls Whilst men in doubt stand scratching their dull polls, They, by mere force of will, their ends achieve! “Ce que femme veut, Dieu veut,” I do believe! And so at once to business. I have got An opening piece, of which I like the plot. (takes MS. out of his pocket) (reading title) “The Camp at Chobham.” Mrs. W. Law! Why that's been done At the Adelphi! By Mark Lemon, 30th June, 1853. Mr. W. A piece-not this one. Mrs. W. But the same titles— Mr. W. More attractive make 'em. When titles are so catching people take 'em Just as they do the measles—from each other. And 'bout this Camp there has been such a pother, The name alone is money sure to bring. So here, you man fly-catching at the wing— (a Carpenter advances from between wings) Shew us a pair of flats. (Carpenter smiles) What do you mean By grinning? Get me out, sir, a tent scene! (aside) Of flats, I'll swear, that rascal meant to say We were the biggest pair he'd seen to-day. (a tent scene is put on) What's this? Car. King Richard's tent, sir. Mr. W. That will do. It's so old that it's actually new. “Methinks the ghosts of all who've Richard murthered” Arise before me! Our cause won't be furthered Much by such actors. (to Carpenter) Two chairs, if you've got 'em! (Call Boy brings forward two old broken chairs) One with three legs—the other with no bottom! “This is a sorry sight!” Mrs. W. “A follish thought To say a sorry sight”—you rather ought To think it a good omen here. Mr. W. How so? Mrs. W. If we can't sit we must stand! Mr. W. Oh oh oh! You've got the inventory of the dresses; What regimentals are there in the presses? Mrs. W. (producing a paper and reading from it) “Uniform coats, one red, one green, one blue.” Mr. W. I don't call that quite uniform. Do you? Mrs. W. (continuing) “Three guns, two bayonets, one sword and belt” Mr. W. How about hats? Mrs. W. Ah, there the pinch is felt! Only one cocked hat! Mr. W. Humph, that won't go far To carry on, as we may say, the war; Although at Astley's half-a-dozen horses And twenty men play all the British forces! Mrs. W. I'll tell you what, we'll have one man well dressed, And let the audience fancy all the rest. Mr. W. Ah, if we could bring Fancy to our aid! Fancy rises from trap, in a jester's costume. Fan. Fancy you can. It's done as soon as said. Mr. W. “Angels and ministers of grace defend us!” What does this novel stage effect portend us? Mrs. W. “Be thou a spirit of health or goblin”— Fan. Hum! Mr. W. “Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from”— Fan. Mum! I'm Fancy. Mrs. W. Only fancy that! Mr. W. Who'd guess, In such a habit— Fan. It's a fancy dress. Mrs. W. A fool's—saving your presence. Fan. You forget That Fancy plays the fool with sense, and yet Without some Fancy Sense would be a frump, While without sense Fancy's not worth a dump! Their happy union makes for youth and age The choicest entertainments of the stage, (For which I have the greatest partiality) And give to every scene I touch reality. Mr. W. Then pray touch some of mine up, and I'd name This tent for one. Fan. With that intent I came. Air—Fancy—“La Donna è mobile.” Fancy her magical Influence lending, Mortals befriending, As much as befooling, Comical—Tragical— Classic—Romantic; Aping each antic— Every sense ruling— As you request her, Comes as a jester, Gaily to test her Influence here. On each sensorium, Wild airs essaying— Fancy sets playing The world at “supposes.” From her emporium, Fashion proceeding— All the town leading By their own noses. Her stage direction Baffles objection; Fancy perfection Can make it appear. But not at Chobham shall my camp be found— The common there is now too common ground To be brushed up by even Fancy's wing. “The Camp at the Olympic” is the thing! Here all the Drama's forces we'll review, And see what troops will flock her standard to. At Fancy's call, the Play-Household Brigade Shall turn out for inspection on parade! (to Mr. Wigan) You as Field-Marshal shall command in chief. (Mr. Wigan retires through tent, and immediately re-enters in a Field Marshal's uniform with bâton) (to Mrs. Wigan) You as “White Sergeant” come with the relief. (Mrs. Wigan goes off, and re-appears in white dress) Changing that horrid every day dress For one which may your brevet rank express In Fancy's Army. Here begins my reign; Current I make “the coinage of the brain,” And General Orders issue from this station, Now the Head-Quarters of Imagination. Trio—Fancy, Mr. and Mrs. Wigan—“Rat-a-plan.” Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! To arms! to arms! ye mighty spirits muster! Here pitch your tents—your standards here unfold. To arms! to arms! the British Drama's lustre, At Fancy's call shed round us as of old! To arms! the Drama's cause uphold! Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! A new campaign the Drama here prepare for, With souls in arms and eager for the fray, Your fights are all sham fights, you know, and therefore At soldiers sure you can't object to play. To arms! the magic call obey. Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan! &amp;c. Scene changes to the Camp of the Combined British Dramatic Forces; on one side are the characteristic tents of Tragedy, Melo-drama, and Opera; on the other those of Comedy, Farce, and Pantomime—In the centre is the large and splendid pavilion of Spectacle. Music—(grant march) Enter Tragedy from her tent in the costume of Lady Macbeth, 1753, a letter in her hand. Fan. First in the field, old English Tragedy In stately hoop and train “comes sweeping by!” As in the British Drama's palmy day, When people took an interest in the play! Mr. W. A letter in her hand! why then the dame is— Fan. The wife of the ambitious Thane of Glamis! Mrs. W. Lady Macbeth! In Dollalolla's dress! Tra. (reading the letter) “They met me in the day of my success.” Mr. W. That must have been a hundred years ago, To judge from a costume so rococo! Tra. (indignantly) In my day, sir, judgment, and power, and feeling, With confidence to public taste appealing, Received the crown—no matter what its fashion, It was the crown! Mr. W. Well, don't be in a passion. Tra. Not in a passion! when I see the State Of Denmark rotten! When I hear the fate Which hath befallen both the classic domes, 'Neath which my votaries once found their homes! Where Garrick, monarch of the mimic scene, His sceptre passed from Kemble down to Kean; Where Cibber's silver tones the heart would steal, And Siddons left her mantle to O'Neil! The Drama banished from her highest places By débardeurs and “fools with varnished faces,” Sees foreign foes her sacred ruins spurning, Fiddling like Neros while her Rome is burning! Fan. The times have changed; but there is still a stage, And one on which Macbeth has been the rage! Tra. Macbeth! Is't possible! O, hie thee here, That I may pour my spirit in thine ear! Music—The pavilion opens and discovers “The Blasted Heath,” same as at the Princess's Theatre, with the Three Witches—Macbeth and Banquo in the costume worn at that theatre—Temp. 1853. Fan. Behold, he comes! Tra. “Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!” Can that be he? Fan. In heavy marching order. Not as when Garrick used to meet the witches— In gold-laced waistcoat and red velvet breeches; (Garrick appears as Macbeth with the daggers) Nor as in Kemble's time, correct was reckoned, Accoutred like “the gallant forty-second,” (Kemble appears as Macbeth, with target and truncheon) But as a Scottish chieftain roamed scot-free— In the year one thousand and fifty-three. Trio—Mr. and Mrs. Wigan and Fancy—“Auld Lang Syne.” My auld acquaintance I've forgot, If ever he was mine; Is that the way they clad a Scot In days o' Lang Syne? For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, For Auld Lang Syne, We'll look on him wi' kindness yet For Auld Lang Syne! Trag. “My countryman—and yet I know him not!” Mr. W. More like an antique Rum'un than a Scot! Tra. A Scotchman, and no kilt? Mrs. W. Don't Macbeth say, “We've scotch'd the snake, not kilt it!” Mr. W. Oh, don't, pray! (scene closes) Air—Fancy—“The Bonnets of Bonny Dundee.” Through their habits conventional managers broke, To make old plays go down they new habits bespoke; The old-fashioned Scotchman no longer we see, Except as a sign for the sale of rappee. So pack up your tartans, whatever your clan, And look a new “garb of old Gaul” out, my man; For the stage in its bonnet has got such a bee, It's all up with “The Bonnets of Bonny Dundee.” Fan. But see, where brilliant Comedy appears, (music—Enter Comedy from her tent, in the costume of Lady Teazle) Blooming as brightly as in former years, Invincible, with powder, paint, and patches, Loaded and primed—her eyes the lighted matches— Ready to play upon a yawning pit, She brings up the artillery of wit! Com. Wit! oh, my dear, don't mention such a thing! Wit on the stage what wit away would fling? There are so few who know it when they hear it, And half of those don't like so much as fear it. Wit! If to theatres for wit they'd come, Would Farquhar, Congreve, Wycherly be dumb? Or even the poor devils now-a-days, Who can't help scribbling, hawk their hapless plays From house to house, to hear the sentence chilling, “Your piece is clever, but won't draw a shilling.” Mr. W. Then, what will draw? Com. O mercy! Tell me, pray, What horse will win the Derby, sir? You may, I'm sure, as easily as I tell you What the dear British public will come to! Just what they like—whatever that may be— Not much to hear, and something strange to see. A Zulu Kaffir, with his bow and quiver; A Pigmy Earthman, from the Orange River; An Aztec Lilliputian, who can't say a Word, from the unknown city Iximaya. Any monstrosity may make a hit, But no one's fool enough to pay for wit! Or if he be, in theatres why seek For jokes, when Punch is but a groat a week! Mr. W. No wonder that in such a situation Your spirits flag! Com. My only consolation Is that all sorts of folks are now so funny, My dulness will be soon worth any money. E'en Tragedy—my sister there—sad soul, Has recently become so very droll, That the judicious few her acts who see, Laugh at her more than at poor Comedy! Tra. (advancing on her) Madam! This irony!— Com. Oh, lud! she'll bite! Mr. W. Part them! they are incensed! Fan. A jest so light Should not to any serious censure doom her; Like Mr. Sulky—she “will have her humour.” Tra. Will she, indeed? Then I'll forgive her gladly, For lately she was wanted humour sadly. Com. Now who's ironical, dear sister, pray? “Oh, sister, sister! sister ev'ry way!” Mr. W. Come, come, be friends! The Drama's foes to rout, The word should be “fall in” and not “fall out.” Air—Mr. Wigan—“We have been friends together.” You have been friends together, Together money made— When tragedies and comedies To crowds were nightly played! And though the word may make you start, The fact you must allow, You have been—damned together! Shall a light word part you now? Mrs. W. Talking of humour—where on earth has fled Our broad old English farce? or is he dead? Fan. No, but too homely for this polished age, He's lately taken French leave of the stage; But there's a substitute still more grotesque We often find for him—he's called Burlesque. Tra. Don't name the wretch! I hate him with a hate Known only on the stage! He mocks my state; Mimics my voice; my words mis-quotes, mis-matches, A vice of kings! a king of shreds and patches! (flourish of penny trumpets heard) Fan. He comes! I know his trumpet! Tra. Too! too! too— Well I remember it! Support me, do! Mr. W. Tragedy! shew me where's the actor strong enough? Tra. Then I shall fall! (sinks into a chair) Mrs. W. Alas, I've thought so long enough! Charivari—Enter Burlesque in the costume of King Arthur in “Tom Thumb.” Bur. “Call up our cavalry from Horselydown!” Queen Tragedy, I'll fight you for a crown! Air—Burlesque—“Such a fine King as I!” Such a fine King as I, Don't care for your frowns a fig! Folks laugh till they're ready to die At the wisdom that's in—my wig! For Burlesque is up! up! up! And Tragedy down! down! down! O! Pop up your nob again! And I'll box you for your crown, O! Toll rol der rol loll, &amp;c. Your Hamlet may give up his Ghost, Your Richard may run himself through, I'm Cock-of-the-Walk to your cost, And I crow over all your crew! For Burlesque is up! up! up! And Tragedy down! down! down! O! Pop up your nob again, And I'll box you for your crown, O! Toll rol der rol loll, &amp;c. Tra. Avaunt, and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee Unreal mockery, hence! I can't abide thee! Bur. Because I fling your follies in your face, And call back all the false starts of your race Shew up your shows, affect your affectation, And by such homœopathic aggravation, Would cleanse your bosom of that perilous stuff, Which weighs upon our art—bombast and puff. Mr. W. Have you so good a purpose then in hand? Bur. Else wherefore breathe I in dramatic land? Mrs. W. I thought your aim was but to make us laugh? Bur. Those who think so but understand me half. Did not my thrice-renownèd Thomas Thumb, That mighty mite, make mouthing Fustian mum? Is Tilburina's madness void of matter? Did great Bombastes strike no nonsense flatter? When in his words he's not one to the wise, When his fool's bolt, spares folly as it flies, When in his chaff there's not a grain to seize on, When in his rhyme there's not a ray of reason, His slang but slang, no point beyond the pun, Burlesque may walk, for he will cease to run. Mr. W. Although your trumpet, sir, is but a penny one, You blow it, I confess, as well as any one! Com. I vow the wretch to common sense pretends! Bur. Don't mention it, I beg, e'en among friends. Like Mr. Snake, though here the truth I own, I should be ruined if abroad 'twere known. I live as that same worthy does aver, Upon the badness of my character. If once of common sense I was suspected, I should be quite as much as you—neglected. Tra. “That's wormwood!” (music) Mr. W. Hark! what means that prelude grand? Enter English Opera as Mandane in “Artaxerxes,” with German Band. Fan. 'Tis English Opera! Mrs. W. With a foreign band! Fan. She takes the best her music book that suits. She always had French horns and German flutes. Com. Has she forgot her native wood-notes wild? Fan. She hasn't chirped them since she was a child. Tra. You mean “When music, heavenly maid, was young,” “And first in early Greece—she—she— Bur. (prompting her) “Gave tongue.” (Tragedy sits down disgusted) Fan. But not in Opera like that before us, The Greeks had none. Tra. They'd Tragedy! Mr. W. And Chorus! Fan. Yes! spoken, so that you heard every word; A sort of chorus now that's never heard. Mr. W. But let us hear what Opera has to say, Or rather sing, in her own cause to-day. Op. (sings) “The soldier tired of war's alarms,” &amp;c. Mr. W. (interrupting her) Thank you! that's quite enough! Oh dear! Oh dear! Bur. That old style don't agree with the new y(ear)! Mrs. W. It was a stile I hoped she had got over! Op. Of English Opera you wished a “Prova”; And that's about the best in English still. Mr. W. Except “the Beggar's.” Op. That's a vaudeville! Mr. W. Have you no new and great airs on your shelves? Op. The greatest airs the singers give themselves! Fan. And while they do so there is little chance Of seeing English Opera advance; The only compositions her proveditors Have lately gained by have been with their creditors. Mr. W. Then Bishop, Balfe, and Barnett, where are they? Mrs. W. Wallace! Macfarren! Tra. (wildly) “Rivers! Vaughan! Grey!” Op. Madam! Fan. Poor soul! Her wits are going fast, She has not seemed quite right for some time past And now Burlesque completely has upset her. Tra. I shall weep soon, and then I shall be better! Mrs. W. Suppose you take a nap? Com. Aye, sister, do; Your audience sleep sometimes, why shouldn't you? Mr. W. (to Comedy) You're too severe upon your sister muse. (to Opera) This interruption, madam, pray excuse. Op. Sir, I'm accustomed to a few bars' rest. Mr. W. You spoke of airs by which you were oppressed. Op. Oh, e'en my foreign rivals on that score Suffer as much as I do, if not more; One has already given up the ghost. Fan. See where it walks! Ghost music from “Don Giovanni”—The Ghost of Her Majesty's Theatre appears, having a great bodily resemblance to Signor Lablache. Once in itself a host! The last, but not the least by any means, Of the great stars that lighted up her scenes. Mr. W. What, old acquaintance! could not all that flesh Keep in a little life? Mine ears refresh With choice Italian. Speak, “Ore retundo!” Enormous artist! Great basso profundo! Ensemble—from “Don Pasquale.” Solo—Ghost of Old Italian Opera. Pacing yon colonnade Most melancholy, Humming the serenade— From “Don Pasquale”; Nightly I wander—sighing and sulky, No more in Figaro, brilliant as bulky! Dull is thy valet now, Gay Don Giovanni! What trump shall rally now “I Puritani”? My Impresario Plays “Belisario” Grisi and Mario Partiti son! Trio—Mr. Wigan, Fancy, English Opera. Bravo, bravo! Don Pasquale! Can no magic flute recall ye, Whose superb recitativo Could this great basso relieve O? Caro mio, let this trio— So enchanting, so bewitching, Bring a moment back to Fancy, The great rôle you were so rich in! Ghost. Bene, si! Now fortissimo! Now pianissimo! Bravo, bravissimo— Bene, si. Trio. But while we strive Once more alive To fancy Don Pasquale, We find, alas, The shadow pass, And so as a finale, Regretting one so great should e'er Be forced to sing so smally, Addio, addio, unhappy Buffo say! Ghost. To the shades I must away, There a deeper part to play! (Ghost retires) Bur. Poor Buffer! Mrs. W. Buffo. Mr. W. In his situation “Buffer's” the more expressive appelation. (to Fancy) “Our cause, my friend, is in a damn'd condition,” The Drama's perishing of inanition, In all its branches, foreign and domestic. Tragedy halting in her march majestic; Poor Comedy with nothing left to spout; Farce only fit to play the people out; The English Opera completely prostrate, And the Italian taken up to Bow Sreet. Air—Mr. Wigan—”Oft in the stilly night.” When I remember all The talent brought together, I've seen in “Don Pasqual”— —E, and in such high feather— I grieve, I own, that he alone Should haunt that stage deserted, Whose lights are fled, and garlands dead, And all but he—departed; Still on an opera night, When other voices wound me— Fond memory brings the light Of all those stars around me! Mrs. W. And whither has the once gay Ballet hopped? Fan. Like the poor sylphide when her wings were cropped, Behold her shorn of all her magic power, Denied to dance upon a single flower. Enter Ballet “à la Sylphide,” with her Coryphées—She expresses her altered state in action to Mr. Wigan. Mr. W. What does she mean? I'm stupid, I've no doubt, But I could never make a ballet out. With diplomatic notes take rank they should, The most successful when least understood. Bal. Oh I could tell you, sir, in words as well, But if the Ballet talk'd it mightn't tell. Fan. She tells you, fallen from her high estate On her last legs she's taken now to skate Like a bold wench, resolved at any price To cut a figure, though it's but on ice. Music—Scene at back opens and shews the skating scene from “Le Prophète,” as at the Italian Opera, Covent Garden. Air—Ballet—Skating Music in “Le Prophète.” We slide and glide and slip and trip, And wheel and reel through snow and sleet, These are bad days when Coryphées Are puzzled to keep their feet! We colds have caught and chilblains brought, To spite our light fantastic toes! And vile Jack Frost perhaps may cost Poor Ballet her lovely nose! (scene closes) Mr. W. Cold comfort this for a new speculator! Mrs. W. For a house warming—a refrigerator! Mr. W. A drama must be found, or we are undone, With spirit in it to stir up all London! Fan. Oh, if you want a piece with spirit in it, I'll call up Melo-drama in a minute. His efforts supernatural have told, When all things else have failed. Appear! A chord—Melo-drama comes through his tent as “the Monster,” in “Frankestein.” Behold! Mr. W. What monster's this? Fan. The one from “Frankenstein.” He reads a lesson to folks in your line. How many a manager I've seen a stew in, Making a monster that has been his ruin! Mrs. W. He looks of blue ruin the incarnation! I've no great hopes from his resuscitation! Fan. There is a spirit of another blue; He sometimes personates the fine old “true!” Chord—Enter William in the melo-drama of “Black-eyed Susan.” Fan. Of “Black-eyed Susan” there the hero stands, Into the pit he oft has piped all hands, And brought the drama up with a wet sail. Bur. He goes a-head—but thereby hangs—a tail. Com. All in the Downs the British fleet lay moored, When “Black-eyed Susan” came the stage on board; The scene is changed—the fleet is at Spithead, And our poor stage “All in the Downs” instead. Fan. Well, there's another sprite at Christmas time That oft does wonders—Comic Pantomime! Spite of blows, tumbles, changes, kicks, and slaps, She makes her annual trips and sets her traps. Music—Pantomime enters as “Mother Goose,” Harlequin, Columbine, Pantaloon, and Clown rise up trap, dance, rally, group. Bur. Shade of Grimaldi! who thy loss can know, That never saw Inimitable Joe! Quintette—Burlesque, Fancy, Opera, and Mr. and Mrs. Wigan,—“There's some one in the house with Dinah.” Solo—Burlesque. (Bone accompaniment.) Old Joe he was an artist great, There's been nobody like him seen of late; To Pantomime 'twas a knock down blow When the curtain fell upon poor old Joe! Poor dear Joe—was the Joe—yes, the Joe! All. Old Joe kicking up behind and before, The Columbine a kicking up behind old Joe; There's no one in this house so fine, ah, Nor any other house I know, There's no one in that funny line, ah, Can play the fool like dear old Joe! Mrs. W. But though suck kickshaws may succeed perchance, We must have some “morceau de résistance”; And from such fare we're as far off as ever. Mr. W. Do help us, Fancy! Fan. Well, don't I endeavour? Shall I invoke the genius of the ring? Mrs. W. What! from Aladdin? Fan. Quite another thing; One who knows how the public in to whip, And witch the world with noble horsemanship. Music—Enter Hippo-drame as a lady attired for the ring, Riding Master, &amp;c. Fan. Hither he brought amusement for the million, When here old Astley first pitched his pavilion. Air—Fancy—“I'm the Genius of the Ring.” He's the Genius of the Ring, To this house by no means new, Horses here could money bring, Ere the stage they were put to; And when fast the stage has stuck, As all stages sometimes do, Horses oft have had the luck The poor Drama to pull through. On Parnassus' highest ground Still a wingèd horse one views, And a horse is to be found Wheresoever there's a Mews; And if Thespis in a cart Made the Drama first the rage, Horses must have played their part In that very early stage. To the Genius of the Ring Then be ev'ry honour due, If the Drama's not the thing Try what Hippo-drame can do! Mr. W. Soft sawdust! I am proof against soft sawder; I've great respect for the equestrian order, And hope its members oft my stalls will pay to; But horses on the stage I must say nay to. To cavalry I own its obligations, But there's no field here for its operations; The genius of the ring it would but cramp, And might put out the genius of the lamp. Fan. You're very hard to please. Mr. W. The town is harder! And sadly empty the dramatic larder. While army-raising Fancy plays the fairy at, I fear she quite forgets the Commissariat! The bravest troops that ever took the field, If they've no food to fight upon, must yield. Music—Spectacle appears in splendid fancy dress. Spec. You're right; and then the food should be well drest, Or quite uneatable may be the best. Mr. W. Who's this that talks and looks so mighty fine? Fan. Spectacle! a great friend of mine. Bur., Op., Pan., Melo., and Hippo. And mine! Fan. You've heard of him, of course! Mr. W. And seen him, too, Till I am almost sick of him! arn't you? Spec. Is this your gratitude for all the splash I've made upon the stage, and all the cash I've brought into the treasury? Mr. W. I doubt If you bring in as much as you take out. Spec. Well, try a piece without me now-a-days; See if your triumph will be called a blaze! Mr. W. The blaze is often only in the bill— Mrs. W. Or one that burns the fingers through the till. Com. Why should a drama that deserves success Burn blue lights, like a vessel in distress? Tra. Has not immortal Shakespeare said 'tis silly, “To gild refinèd gold—to paint the lily?” Spec. Immortal Shakespeare! come, the less you say The better on that head. There's not a play Of his for many a year the town has taken, If I've not buttered preciously his bacon. Tra. More shame, then, for the town! Spec. (to Comedy) And you, Miss Prue; Pray, has Spectacle nothing done for you? Have I not given you correct costumes, And furnished splendidly your drawing-rooms! Ungrateful minx! till my Augustan age You never saw a carpet on your stage. Dragging your train through dust of other days, You envied Tragedy her old green baize; And all the sticks to muster you were able Consisted but of two chairs and a table! Com. You have improved my room, I don't deny, But you preferred it to my company; And Lady Townley now, or Lady Teazle, May starve unless she'll dance, “Pop goes the weasel!” Fan. What's to be done when the immortal names Of Shakespeare and of Byron urge their claims, In vain to popularity, without Spectacle march all his contingent out? Not mere Dutch metal, spangles, foil, and paste, But gems culled from authority by Taste; Until, reflecting every bygone age, A picture-gallery becomes the stage; And modern Babylon may there behold The pomp and pageantry that wrecked the old! Music—The pavilion of Spectacle opens and discovers Tableau from “Sardanapalus.” Mrs. W. It seems, then, that the new way to success Is when the Drama halts, to make it dress. Fan. “The tailor makes the man,” we used to say— The tailor makes the manager, to-day. Com. Oh, if he'd really be our benefactor, Let him take one stitch more and make the actor! Fan. Well, Fancy has done all she can to aid you, And seems more fanciful but to have made you. You must make up your mind—if you have got one— Out of all these fair offers is there not one That you can count on? Tra. (to Mr. Wigan) Tragedy restore To the proud station that she held of yore! Com. (to Mr. Wigan) Give Comedy again a chance to play Where folks may hear what she has got to say. Mr. W. Thus Tragedy and Comedy between, I stand like Garrick—in the print, I mean, The only way like him that I could stand— A musing, with a Muse on either hand! Now swayed by Mirth—now mov'd by Melancholy, Or, like Macheath, 'twixt Lucy and poor Polly! Air—Mr. Wigan—“How happy could I be with either.” How happy could I be with either, If either were certain to pay, But really I much question whether To both I had not better say— Tol de rol de rol lol de rol loddy, &amp;c. Tragedy knocks his hat out of his hand. Comedy picks it up, brushes, and restores it to him. Op. Let native music here, then, weave her spell— You really sing yourself, sir, pretty well; Italian Opera can't object to roam (Rome), For English Opera “there's no place like home.” Melo. Try me! I keep all spirits under my lock! Bur. Try me, my boy, remember Mr. Shylock! Mr. Robson had previously made a great hit as Shylock, in F. Talfourd's burlesque of “Shylock; or, the Merchant of Venice Preserved.” Pan. Before you leap, just look at one of mine! Spec. Without me you can never cut a shine! Bal. You'll catch no mice without an “entre chat.” Hippo. What can you find like horses, pray, to draw? Mr. W. I am completely bothered, that's a fact, And, like some actors, don't know how to act! Tra. But screw your courage to the sticking place! Mr. W. I have—and stuck quite fast—that's just my case. Mrs. W. I'll tell you what to do. Mr. W. I wish you would. Mrs. W. In each of them there's something that is good. Without committing ourselves here to fix 'em, Let's take the best and mix 'em. Mr. W. Mix 'em! Mrs. W. Mix 'em. Mr. W. Like pickles? or like physic? what a notion! D'ye think the town will swallow such a potion? Why, Tragedy's a black dose of itself! Mrs. W. Who talks of taking all, you silly elf? I mean an extract of each spirit—Tragic, Comic, Satiric, Operatic, Magic, Romantic, Pantomimic, Choreographic, Spectacular, Hip— Mr. W. Spare that tongue seraphic Such vain exertion—for they would but call Your mixture melo-drama, after all. Mrs. W. With all my heart, I say, I don't care what It's called, provided always it is not Of “the stage stagey”—whatsoe'er we do, Let there be nature in't— Fan. And fancy, too. Mrs. W. By all means, for with you I quite agree, Without some Fancy, dull e'en sense would be. Besides, you know, to vary our diversions, We must make supernatural exertions. Mr. W. “It must be so; Plato, thou reasonest well.” On second thoughts I think the plan will tell. Elegant extracts shall be, as you say, In this, our Camp, the order of the day. And so—attention! eyes right! dress up there! I fear it's hopeless to say “as you were;” But as you are—on you I will depend, So “stand at ease!” Tra. And you will stand my friend? Mr. W. One of the best you ever had on earth; I wouldn't murder you for all you're worth! Tra. Then I may take myself off, I suppose? Bur. “Do it, nor leave the task to me!” Tra. Here goes! Mr. W. Stay! though I leave Burlesque to cure your bathos, We'll keep of Tragedy the gentler pathos. (to Comedy) From you I would extract—you look so arch, Upon me, I'm afraid, you'll steal a march— Gay as a lark, and so good-humoured too, I feel I can't extract too much from you! (to Melo-drama) Some spirits from your vasty deep I'll call; Ballet shall help me to keep up the ball, Opera lend a ballad or romanza, And Fancy make burlesque, extravaganza. Pantomime teach me how to do the trick; E'en Hippo-drame may furnish a last kick. Spec. Well, try what trick you please to get the tin with, Spectacle's, after all, the card to win with. Mr. W. Yes, after all; yet in one sense, my friend, Spectacle should not be the Drama's end. Where that's the case the satirists may say It is indeed all over with the play! But my play's over now, thanks to your stars! (to Fancy) (to Audience) And now I fain would call up your huzzahs, To keep the ground for us and our review. I have not told you all I mean to do; For on that head—as promises may fetter— The lessee thinks the less he says the better! But to our Chobham if you will but tramp, And smile on our experimental Camp. A gallant corps in time I hope to form, Which may, some fine night, take the town by storm! Oh! let me hope that hope's not a forlorn one, I'm a bold man, if ever there was born one! Pardon that boldness in my utmost need, And by your coups de main make mine succeed; Confirming me in this proud situation, By the command of general approbation. Spec. From me to borrow nothing do you mean? Mr. W. Perhaps you'll favour me with a last scene, On this occasion, by your own desire. Spec. Then give the word— Mr. W. Make ready!—present! (scene changes to a splendid Fairy Temple) Fire! (coloured fires are lighted) Chorus-Finale —“The Sturm Marsch.” March to support the Drama's small division here; Into the ranks before us nightly volunteer; Over “the roughs” at Chobham you your pleasure took! Over “the roughs” you meet with her be pleased to look! Solo—Mr. Wigan. Critics, don't our ardour damp, Nor compel us to decamp; Kindly, just as something new, Pray review our “Grand Review.” Solo—Fancy. Only fancy what on earth will Fancy do, If her fancy sketch you take no fancy to! In this mighty wise utilitarian age Leave to Fancy still a little, tiny stage! Chorus. March to support, &amp;c. Chorus. (Grand Salute) Thus presenting arms before we march away, End we our review! Off with beating drums and flying colours pray, Let the piece go too; Command us by a parting cheer, Nightly to salute you here! CURTAIN.</field>
