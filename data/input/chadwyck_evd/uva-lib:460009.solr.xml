      <field name="fulltext">EURYDICE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His Grace The Duke of Montrose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by Aaron Hill, Esq; Spoken by Mr. Wilks. In youth, when modesty and merit meet, How rare the union! and the force how sweet! Tho' at small praise our humble author aims, His friend may give him, what his blush disclaims. Ladies!âto you he makes his chief address; Form'd, to be pray'd to, and even born to bless! He feels your power, himself, and makes it felt; His scenes will teach each stubborn heart to melt: And each fair eye, that now shines softly here, Anon shall shine, still softer, thro' a tear. Let not constraint your gen'rous sighs repress, Nor veil compassion, nor repel distress. Your sex's strength is in such weakness found; And sighs and tears but help your charms to wound. Of all the wonders taught us by the fair, 'Tis strangest, Tragedy shou'd lose their care! Where Love, soft tyrant! in full glory reigns; And sovereign Beauty holds the world in chains. Less polish'd, and more bold, the Comic Muse Unkings your Cupid, or obstructs his views; Upholds presuming wit's familiar claim, And blots out awe from Love's diminish'd flame. Finds, or makes faults, and sets 'em strong in sight, And dares draw Woman false, or vain, or light. While Tragedyâyour servant, try'd, and true, Still to your fame devoted, and to You! Enslav'd to Love, subdu'd ambition brings, Firms Beauty's power, and crowns it king of kings. Let wish'd attention grace our scene to-night, And mourn'd afflictions move refin'd delight. Each tender light of life we recommend; Wife, husband, subject, parent, son, and friend! All! your impassion'd Int'rests shall engage, And hopes and fears, and pity, fire the stage. Then, when soft sorrow swells the fair one's breast, And sad impressions mix with nightly rest, Pleasing remembrance shall our scene supply, And the sweet saddening influence never die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Aaron Hill Esq; Spoken by Miss Robinson, in boys clothes; tripping in hastily. Oh! Gentlemen!âI'm comeâbut was not sent ye: A voluntierâPray does my size content ye? Man, I am yoursâSex!âbless'd, as heaven can make ye, And from this time, weak Woman! I forsake ye. Who'd be a wife? when each new Play can teach us, To what fine ends these Lords of ours beseech us? At first, whate'er they do, they doâso charming! But mark what follows; frightful! and alarming! They feed too fast on Love; then sick'ning tell us, They can't, forsooth, be kindâbecause they're jealous. Who wou'd be woman, then? to sighâand suffer, And wishâand waitâfor the slow-coming proffer! Not Iâfarewel to petticoats, and stitching, And welcome dear, dear, breeches! more bewitching. Henceforth, new-moulded, I'll rove, love, and wander, And fight, and stormâand charmâlike Periander. Born for this dapper age; pert, short, and clever; If e'er I grow a Manâ'tis now, or never. Well! but what conduct suits this transformation? I'll copy some smart soul of conversation. Shou'd there be war, I'd talk of fields and trenches; Shou'd there be peaceâI'd toast ten favourite wenches! Shou'd I be lov'dâGadso! how then?âno matter, I'll bow, as you doâand look foolish at her. And so, who knows, that never means to prove ye, But I'm as good a Man, as any of ye! Well! 'tis a charming frolickâand I'll do't: Sirs!âhave I your consent?âWhat say ye to't? Yet holdâPerhaps they'll dread a rival beau: I may be what I seem, for aught they know. Ladies! farewelâI shou'd be loth to leave ye, Cou'd an increase of pretty fellows grieve ye: Each, like myself, devoted, ne'er to harm ye, And full as fit, no doubt, to serve and charm ye.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE, Corinth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Eurydice, Melissa. Eurydice. Ye heavenly Powers! What means this dreadful war of sea and sky! Melissa. Dreadful indeed. It rose not by degrees, But all at once, a tempest wild and loud. Eurydice. Hear! from the wintry north how keen it howls Thro' these lone towers that rock with every blast, Each moment threatning ruine on our heads. But seeâstand here, and cast thy eyes below O'er the broad ocean to the distant sky, See what confusion fills the raving deep! What mountain-waves arise!â'Tis terrible, And suiting to the horrors of my fate, The deep despair that desolates my soul. Melissa. Ha! look, behold, due west where yonder rocks O'erhang the beating tidesâO sight of woe! Four goodly ships, abandon'd to the storm, Drive blindly with the billows; their drench'd sails Stript off, and whirl'd before the rending wind. Eurydice. Assist them, all good Powers! The storm is high, And the flood perilous. Look! now they climb a fearful steep, and hang On the big surge that mixes with the clouds. Save me! it bursts, and headlong down they reel Into the yawning gulphâThey cannot scape. A sea rowls o'er the foremost. Melissa. Ah! she strikes On yonder wave-worn cliff. The fatal shock Has doubtless shiver'd her strong side. She sinks So swiftly down, that scarce the straining eye Can trace her tallest mast.âWhere is she now! Hid in the wild abyss, with all her crew, All lost for ever! Eurydice. Turn we from the sight, Too dismal for a woman's eye to bear. Ill-fated men! whom, knowing not, I mourn; Whence, or what may they be? Even now, perhaps, In some far-distant land, a faithful wife, Or tender parent, offers vows to heaven For their return; and fondly numbers up The lingring months of absence. Fruitless love! They never more shall meet!âBy my own ills Severely taught, I pity them; yet think Their fate, all full of horror as it seems, Is rather to be envy'd. They are now Beyond the hand of Fate, at rest for ever! While I, Melissaâ Melissa. Ah, Eurydice, My royal Mistress, rather think the Gods Would teach you, by this sight of mournful ruine, Patience and gentler thought. When others too Are miserable, not to know the worst Is some degree of bliss. Eurydice. Melissa, no. I tell thee, no ill fate, no face of death Can be so dreadful as a life like mine. Call to thy thoughts what I have been; how great, How happy in a husband, and a son The rising boast of Greece. Behold me now Cast down to lowest infamy; the slave, The sport of a foul Tyrant, who betray'd me, And would destroy my honour.âGracious heaven! And shall this bold offender, who has broke All bonds of holy faith, yet bids his soul Rejoyce and take her ease; shall he long triumph Here in the throne of Corinth, while its lord, The injur'd Periander, roams a fugitive, Far, far from bliss and me! Melissa. These tears, my Queen, These faithful tears, which sympathy of sorrow Draws from my eyes, speak the sad share I take In all your mighty ills. Eurydice. Say now, Melissa, Is there among the daughters of Affliction One so forlorn as poor Eurydice? A prisoner here, subjected to the power Of impious Procles, daily doom'd to hear, O deadly insult! his detested love. What ill can equal this? Why did I trust The brutal Tyrant? Melissa. See, his Minion's here. SCENE II. Eurydice, Melissa, Medon. Medon. Hail, beauteous Queen! By me, the royal Procles With lowly service bends him to your charms: Bids smiling health, and gentle peace of mind Light up your morn, and make your evening fair. This, with the tenderest vowsâ Eurydice. Canst thou inform me Of those unhappy men, whom I but now Saw perish on this coast? Medon. Not who they are; But what their fate, these eyes with dread beheld. The King too, from the morning's chase return'd, At this sad sight spur'd on with all his train To save, if possible, whom the wild sea Casts forth upon the land. But first his love, That counts each moment's absence from your eyes An age of lingring torment, bade me fly With health and greeting to the matchless fair, That holds his soul enslav'd. Eurydice. Then bear him back, From her whom he has wrong'd, betray'd and ruin'd, Horror and loathing, unrelenting scorn, And all a woman's hate, in just return For his detested love. The tyrant coward! To crush the fallen and helpless! to embitter The pangs, the miseries, himself has caus'd With gall of mockery! Medon. Your pardon, Madam, If I, the humblest of your slaves, presume To place before your eyes in faithful prospect That mournful period, full of dread and danger, Which late you saw. Behold then your false subjects, Wantonly mad and spurning every tye Of sworn obedience, mix'd in one bold treason, Threatning and universal: your lost husband Absent, involv'd in unsuccessful war: His troops averse and mutinous. From them Bold faction with contagious swiftness spread To Corinth too; where the wild herd arrous'd Insulted you, and drove you to this Fortress. Say where was then your hope, when meagre Famine Join'd his devouring ravage; and your eyes Saw daily, hourly perish those poor few Whose faith had kept them yours? Eurydice. O would to heaven I then had perish'd too! Medon. Such was your state, Lost even to hope, when generous Procles flew Impatient to your aid, dispers'd and quell'd The general treason. May I dare to urge These services? But what are these? His throne, His heart is yours: he lays them at your feet: He bids you reign in both. Eurydice. Thou base of heart! To slaves like thee, who flatter and inflame Their prince's crimes, are owing half the plagues That curse mankind. Has not thy cruel Master, Whose guilt this shameful praise of thine brings home On thy own soul, say, has not he usurp'd, With perfidy avow'd, the very crown He swore to save? And I tooâthy bold insult Shews I indeed am wretched. But away. 'Tis base to parle with thee, the sycophant Who leads him on from guilt to guilt, and swears He grows a God by sinning. SCENE III. Eurydice, Melissa. Melissa. Ah, my Queen, My heart forebodes some fatal consequence Will grow of this. Eurydice. Why let it come, Melissa. I merit all that fortune can inflict, For trusting this betrayer, this curst Procles. Melissa. Alas, what could you do? Eurydice. I should have dy'd. He was the known and mortal foe of Corinth. Melissa. Yet his fair-seeming might have won belief From doubting Age, or wary Policy. By frequent, urgent message he conjur'd you To save yourself. With open honour own'd His antient enmity; but, by each Power Celestial and infernal, swore 'twas past. Nay more, that as a king and as a man, Just indignation at your impious subjects, And pity of your fate, had touch'd his heart. Eurydice. But Fame had spoke him faithless, bold, ambitious. No; 'twas the coward woman in my soul, Th'inglorious fear of dying, that betray'd My vertue into the Deceiver's power. For this my heart, each conscious hour upbraids me, As faithless to my trust, weak, and unworthy Even of the base precarious life I hold. For this, O crown of misery! I'm doom'd Daily to hear the Tyrant's impious passion, His horrid vows and oaths. Melissa. That way indeed I dread to turn my thoughts. A soul so brutal, And flown with nightly insolence and wine, What may he not attempt? Eurydice. O curse! to know That I am in his power, and yet compell'd To suffer hated life!âfor can I die Unheard, unjustify'd; while yet perhaps Th'unhappy Periander thinks too hardly Of my late error?âKing of gods and men! Whose universal eye beholds each thought Most secret in the soul, give me to clear My faith to him; I ask of heaven no more For my past miseries. Melissa. What shouts are these? [looking out. Ah me! th'inhuman triumph of the croud, The hard-soul'd many, who have watch'd the storm For driving wrecks, the spoils of perish'd wretches. Eurydice. Unfeeling beasts of prey!âMethinks the storm Is almost overblown. The waves subside, And fall their fiercer roarings. But alas! Of all the four, not one remaining sail Is to be seen around. Melissa. Either my eyes Deceive me, or the good Leonidas Moves towards us. Eurydice. 'Tis he: and on his brow Sits some afflicting thought. Ha! whence is this? What mean these secret shiverings, this dark horror Of some approaching ill? SCENE IV. Eurydice, Melissa, Leonidas. Leonidas. Forgive me, Madam, That I appear before you to impart A mournful message: but by Procles' orderâ Eurydice. Whate'er proceeds from him, Leonidas, Must needs be fatal to me. But say on. No form of ruine is so dreadful now, As being in his power. Leonidas. Unhappy Queen! Your fate might melt the hardest breast, and teach Even Cruelty's remorseless eye to weep. How shall I speak the rest? Eurydice. Leonidas! What is this fatal tale too sad for utterance? I cannot bear suspense, that worst of torturesâ Is Periander safe? Leonidas. This ruinous storm, Whose sudden outrageâ Eurydice. Ha! what ships were these, Say, speak, that sunk but now before our eyes In sight of shore? Leonidas. The very fleet design'd To rescue you; to free repenting Corinth From this betrayer, this detested Procles. The King was there embark'd. Eurydice. Then all is lost! Melissa. Ah heaven! she faints. Leonidas. Behold, ye Gods! this sight. Remember the curst Author of this ruine. My eyes, my soul's in tears to see her thus. Eurydice. O Periander! my much-injur'd Lord! Would I had dy'd for theeâAh! gentle maid, Was it then he, my husband, whom these eyes Saw perish in the storm! whose fate I wept, Nor knew that all the cruel wreck was mine! Melissa. Unhappy day! Eurydice. Undone Eurydice! But I will dieâI should have dy'd before When my mean cowardice, my dread of death, Betray'd me to false Procles. I had then Dy'd innocent: I had not then deserv'd A ruin'd husband's curse.âO thought of horror! Perhaps his latest breath, even in the hour Of dreadful fate, charg'd me with all his wrongs, His life and honour lost! perhaps expir'd In imprecations on me! Melissa. Oh, for pity, Forbear these fatal thoughts. They but inflame The rage of real ills, and wound you deeper. Leonidas. Would tears, my gracious Mistress, aught avail us, Methinks these aged eyes could number drops With falling clouds, or the perpetual stream. But while we mourn, our enemy rejoyces, And sounds his cruel triumph loud to heaven: Heart-stabbing thought! Then cease we tears and sighs, That aid for trivial ills. Call we instead Heaven's slumbering justice down, and loud invoke The Powers of vengeance to our aid. Who knows But some more happy hour remainsâ Eurydice. O no. There is no happy hour in store for me. All, all are past and gone. Even Hope himself, The wretche's latest friend, is fled for ever. Death and the grave are now my only refuge: There even my woes may rest. Leonidas. And who will then Befriend your orphan-son? What eye will pity; What aiding hand rear his fair-springing youth, And shelter him from want, from woe? Oh none Think then you hear this darling of your soul, Your Polydore, call loud on you to live, To live for him, and by your guardian care Supply a father's loss. Eurydice. Unhappy boy! Too soon alas! acquainted with ill fortune. And does he live? Leonidas. Those few that scap'd the storm Gave me to hope he sail'd not with the fleet. But for this Procles, Madam, this betrayer; If I have bow'd me to his impious will, Tho' with that strong abhorrence Nature feels At what she holds most mortal, 'twas to turn Against the traitor his own treacherous arts, And ruin him more surely. This may be. Sad Corinth looks with horror on the hand That scourges her each hour with whips of scorpions. She waits but some fair chance, at once to rise And drive him from her throne. Melissa. These trumpets speak His near approach. Eurydice. Father of human kind! Eternal Justice! hear these guilty sounds! Behold this Tyrant's revel! while a King, Thy great resemblance, floats a cold pale corse; Or on the naked beach cast vilely out, Unknown, unhonour'd lies. Leonidas, By all my griefs I beg thee, search these shores, Each cliff and cavern where the wild wave beats, For my lov'd Lord, and to these widow'd arms Give back his dear remains. But Procles comes. SCENE V. Procles, Medon, Leonidas, Attendants. Procles. Hail glorious day! auspicious fortune hail! From this triumphant hour my future life Runs fair and smiling on, no cloud of ill To shade its brightness. Medon, was it not A wonderous chance? Medon. Beyond our hope, my Lord. Yet tho' the danger's o'er, with awe and trembling I still look back to the dread precipice Where late you stood! Procles. 'Tis true, he had well nigh Surpriz'd me unprovided: but th'attempt Is perish'd with its author. From on high Heaven arm'd his winds and seas to fight for me: And victory is mine without my care, Almost without my knowledge. Yes the Gods, The Gods themselves espouse my happy cause! For this, let flowery garlands wreathe their shrines; Let hecatombs before their altars bleed, And triumph reign thro' Corinth. [Attendants withdraw. Is the Queen Inform'd of all, Leonidas? Leonidas. She is. Procles. And she receiv'd the newsâ Leonidas. With sad surprise, And many tears, my Lord. Procles. Just the fond sex. Such their vain grief; a moment's passing storm, Then all is calm. Be it thy farther care, As the receding flood forsakes the shore, To make strict search thro' all this coast around For Periander's Corpse. I would methinks A while indulge my eyes; a while peruse The features of a rival once so fam'd, So terrible in arms; whose partial fortune Soar'd high above, and ever thwarted mine In all the dearer aims that swell my thought, Love and ambition. Leonidas. Mark this, righteous heaven! SCENE VI. Procles, Medon. Medon. At length, Sir, all the Gods declare for you, And fortune is your own. Your native realm, Fair Epidaurus, peaceful and resign'd, Acknowledges her Lord. Your rival's fate Confirms his kingdom yours. Procles. Yet I am still Unblest amidst this flow of prosperous fortune. Not all that charms Ambition's shoreless wish, Empire and kneeling homage, can bestow The better joy I long for. Medon. Ah, my Prince, Forget, or scorn that proud ill-natur'd fair one. Procles. Impossible. By heaven my soul can form No wish, no thought but her. I tell thee, Medon, With blushes tell thee, this proud charmer reigns Unbounded o'er my reason. I have try'd Each shape, each art of varied love to win her; Alternate prayers and threats, the soothing skill Of passionate sincerity, the fire Of rapturous vows: but all these arts were vain. Her rooted hate is not to be remov'd. And 'twas my soul's first aim, the towering point Of all my wishes, to prevail in this; To triumph o'er my rival too in love. That had been great revenge! but baffled here, I'm disappointed still. Medon. Believe me, Sir, When once the fit of wilfulness is o'er, The burst of tears discharg'd, she'll quickly soften, Stoop to your wishes, and forget a husband Who is no more. Procles. Perdition on his name! I dread his memory as my rival still. But if I have not won her to be mine, At least the hated husband reap'd no joy From her fantastic honour. Stung to madness For ill-requited love, I darkly spread Surmizes of her truth. He thought her false: And, as he doated on her, the dire tale Was poison to his quiet. Jealousy, In all its horrors, must have seiz'd his soul. I triumph'd there! Medon. 'Twas exquisite revenge. I too, my Lord, who live but for your pleasure, Your ever-faithful slave, I too combin'd To aid your vengeance. You can still remember When in a dungeon's depth Ariston lay, Ariston, Periander's factious friend. With looks of seeming pity I oft mourn'd His hard imprisonment, complain'd of you, Nay curs'd your cruelty; till I had brought His unsuspecting honesty to credit My fiction of the Queen. I told him then, With well-dissembled hatred of her crime, Embittering every circumstance, that she, Forgetful of her better fame, had heard Your secret passion, and with equal ardor Return'd its warmth. Nay that she often urg'd you To wreak your rage on him, the hated friend Of Periander. Having thus alarm'd him, After long pause I let him scape at last To find his master out. Procles. I thank thee, Medon. But this avails not much. My soul burns in me With furious longings to subdue that woman; To bend her pride of vertue to my passion. I fancy, in her arms, transcendant joys, A heaven of higher bliss, not to be found In unresisting Beauty, woo'd and won At idle leisure. Yet once more I mean To try the fortune of my wishes with her: And if I am repuls'd, away at once All little arts of love. Medon. Mean while, the banquet, Which Pleasure's curious hand hath furnish'd out With splendid choice, awaits you, and invites To laughing thought and triumph. There the God, Th'inspiring God of wine, with rose-buds crown'd, Mirth in his look, and at his side the band Of little playful Loves, fills high the bowl, And bids it flow unbounded. Music too Joins her enchanting voice, and wooes the soul With all her powerful skill of moving strains: Till the gay hour is quite dissolv'd in bliss, In ecstacy of revel, all-unknown To lean-look'd Temperance, and his peevish train. Procles. Come on then, Medon. Life is vainly short; A very dream of being: and when death Has quench'd this finer flame that moves the heart, Beyond is all oblivion, and waste night That knows no following dawn, where we shall be As we had never been. The Present then Is only ours: and shall we let it pass, Untasted, unenjoy'd? No; let us on. Hail we the rising shade: and now while night Leads on the secret hour of free delight, With wanton gayety, in naked state, Let Music, Mirth, and Love around us wait. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The scene a rocky coast, terminated by a view of the ocean. Periander alone. By the pale glimmering of the falling moon, Amid the broken windings of these rocks I wander on forlorn, and find no place To trust my head, or rest my weary steps. Horror pursues me close. In each low blast, And murmur of the main, methinks I hear The murderous spies of Procles at my heels. Thou mournful Queen of heaven! and ye dread Gods! Who rule the fearful secresy of night; Behold me here, the sport of human chance, A nameless wretch, a ruine hardly sav'd From the devouring deep. There my last hopes, My great revenge lies buried.âIs there more? Away, away; a Traitor fills my throne, Triumphant in his crimes: and I the while Roam here a midnight fugitive. Yet this, All this I could have borne. He was my foe, The jealous rival of my powerâBut thou, In whom my soul had treasur'd up her heaven, Friendship, and faith, and love, Eurydice! Thou to betray me! [letting himself fall against the rock. Ha! by the moon's sad beam, I can descry The towers that hold this author of my shameâ Nay, Procles too, perhapsâand may not he, Even nowâconfusion! death! he may, he does Invade my bedâO hell! she smiles to hear The story of my fateâAnd now they give A loose to impious Joys.âAll-seeing Powers! And does your vengeance slumber? Are your bolts Reserv'd for me alone?âHa!âyet 'tis just. Conscience, that in the day of fortune's favour, Securely slept, now rouses into strong And dread conviction of her crime. I broke The sacred oath sworn to a dying father, To free my country from her chains. My soul Shakes, as I roll this thought. O Providence! Awfully just, tho' Guilt may shut her eye, Thine ever wakes to mark, to trace, to punish! SCENE II. Periander, Leonidas. Leonidas. This way a distant sound alarm'd my ear. Broken it seem'd to be; the voice of mourning, And deep distress. Methought it rose just here, From these deaf-sounding cliffs. But all is still! Save the hoarse deep yet working from the storm. Some Power direct my steps where I may find, By this faint moon-light, my lov'd Master's corpse, To save his sacred reliques from the rage Of brutish tyranny.âHa! what art thou? A man, or fear-form'd Shadow of the night? Periander. Leonidas! Leonidas. The same. But speak again. Periander. Leonidas! Leonidas. Ha! can it be, ye Powers! My royal Lord? Periander coming forward. A wretch that has no name. Leonidas. Oh all ye Gods! may I believe my senses? 'Tis he! my Prince!âJust heaven to thee I kneel, And thus adore thy gracious providence. 'Tis most amazing! Periander. Rise, Leonidas. I am beneath thy care. Thou seest me here The last of men, cast off by all good Powers; Sav'd from the deep to be more lost on shore. Leonidas. My king and master, tho' my heart bleeds in me With all your mighty ills, I must again Bless that good heaven whose providence has sav'd you. 'Tis great! 'tis wonderous all! But how, oh how Have you escap'd the Tyrant's jealous search? His guards with strict survey rang'd every cliff, And hollow of these rocks. Periander. I'll tell thee then. We were in sight of Corinth, when at once Broad darkness hid the sky: at once the winds Roar'd with mad bluster o'er us, and the seas In rowling mountains rose. A storm so fierce, So big with ruine, baffled our best skill. Despair struck every heart. The ship ran round In giddy whirls, and bulg'd on some hid rock. O dismal moment! still methinks I hear The general, dying scream of multitudes Just drowning in th'abyss. How poor a thing Is a King then, Leonidas! I grasp'd A floating wreck, the big sea roaring round me, And bursting o'er my head; but, bury'd deep Beneath the whelming tide, at once I lost The light of heaven and life. A wave it seems Lodg'd me within a cavern's secret depth, Near yon tall mountain. Leonidas. Miracle of fate! Sure God's immediate hand conducted it, Severely merciful.âHow shall I tell What pangs, what agonies of soul I felt At sight of your sad wreck?âBut, Sir, the Prince, What of his fate? Periander. I know not what to think: But to be mine, it seems, is to be wretched. Half of my fleet, yet riding in the port, I left to his command, but with strict charge To sail a few hours after. 'Twere in vain To tell thee now the reason of my order. This storm, I fear, may have surpriz'd him too, Unhappy boy! Leonidas. Your own escape, my Lord, So full of wonder, and beyond all hope, Inclines me to strong faith that heaven is still Concern'd for your affairs.âBut to behold you, So late the first and happiest of mankind, Alone and wandering here at the dead hour; No roof, but heaven's high cope to shelter you; No couch, but this unhospitable earth To rest your brine-drench'd limbsâit kills my heart. Curse on the Tyrant! Periander. Prithee think me not So poorly soul'd to stoop beneath the pressure Of Fortune's hand. That were to merit it. But there is still behindâO death to honour! One crushing blow that lays me low indeed! That sinks me in the dust! Leonidas. What do I hear! Your words amaze me. Periander. How, Leonidas! Surely thou art no stranger to my thought. ProclesâEurydiceâWilt thou not speak To save my shame. Say, tell me what thou know'st Of that bad woman. Leonidas. With such watchful care The Tyrant's trusted spies observe her steps, That till this fatal evening, when by order Of Procles, I inform'd her of your death, I have not seen her once. Periander. Just what I fear'd. That guilty secresy was well contriv'd To cover crimes too foul for honest eyes, And heaven's fair light to see. None, none but Procles Could gain admittance: and to him my gates, My fortress, nay my bed it self was open! Leonidas. O wrong her not, my Lord. Had you but seen With what convulsive pangs of heart-felt anguish, What bleeding agonies, she heard the tale Of your imagin'd death, your soul would melt In pity of her woes. This Procles too Call'd down each Power of heaven to witness for him, He meant her fair. Hers was the common cause Of kings, he said; whose place and honour bound 'em To scourge rebellion, in whatever shape, Wherever found. And then what was her state? Death in his ghastliest form, devouring famine, Hung instant o'er her head. O think of this, And add not to her wrongs. Periander. Ha! wrong her, say'st thou? Answer me: has she not entail'd disgrace, And vileness on my name? Has she not made me The laughter of my foe, the scoff of Procles? O curse! is there in all the wrath of heaven A plague, a ruine, like that infamy! Wrong herâI am too well inform'd of all; Too certain of the blushful stain that cleaves To me and mine for ever! Leonidas. Ah, my Lord, By all good Powers, by your eternal quiet, I beg you hear meâ Periander. I have heard too much, Too much, just Gods! to hope for quiet more. Those fates inexorable, that pursue My life with utmost rigor, would not spare me The knowledge of my shame. From my best friend Blushing I learnt itâBut hast thou e'er felt That heart of anguish stab'd by murderous fears, And shuddering with ten thousand mortal thoughts! That tempest of the soul that knows no calm; Tossing from love to hate, from doubt to rage, To raving agony! Leonidas. Alas! my Lord, Trust me, I weep to hear so sad a tale. Periander. I'll tell thee all; for oh! my soul is full, And must have vent. My aking memory, Still fruitful to my torture, brings again Those days, those months of horror I have known. Abandon'd to distraction, I renounc'd The commerce of mankind. I sought to vent My ravings in the wildness of the woods; To hide my shame in their profoundest night. The morn still brought it back: the midnight-shade Could not conceal it. Her lone echoes groan'd Unceasing with my pangs: and her sad ghosts, Forbid to rest even in the grave, in me Beheld a soul more lost, more curst, than they. Leonidas. O Sir, no moreâ Periander. When I call'd back past time, Life's vernal season, the soft hours of peace And unsuspecting love; our growing joys In rearing one lov'd son; that heaven of bliss Which princes seldom find, and was all ours; My soul dy'd in me. Solitary, wild, I wept, I groan'd, in bitterness of heart. But when curst Procles flash'd on my remembrance, My known, my deadly foeâthat he of all, That he had made her vile! 'twas then, 'tis now Rage, fury, madness.âYou at last arrous'd me To thoughts of vengeance. With all speed I sail'd, Feeding my frenzy with the gloomy joy Of stabbing the betrayer in her arms; Of plunging both to hellâbut this curst storm! These treacherous waves! Leonidas. Ye Gods! what have I heard! Alas! alas! all waves, all storms are calms To Jealousy. O my lov'd Lord, beware Of that destroyer, that self-torturing fiend, Who loves his pain, and feeds the cruel cares That prey upon his life; whose frantic eye Is ever open, ever prying round For what he dreads to find. By all most dear And inward to my soul, I think the Queen As pure as Truth herself. This is, by heaven, Some dark-laid treachery, the crime of Procles. Periander. Of Procles, say'st thou? Leonidas. Oh you know him not. Lust and ambition are not all his guilt. But now's no time, my Lord, For farther talk. I tremble for your life. This place is hostile ground: and Danger here May find us out, tho' shrouded round with night. Hence let us fly, where I may lodge you safe In some obscure retreat; till pitying heaven Unravel this perplexity of ills, And point us what to do. Periander. Thou good old man! By heaven, thy matchless honesty and truth Half reconcile me to disgrace and ruine. Yet blushing let me tell thee all my follyâ Might I but see Eurydice.âNay start not: I know 'tis base. I know she is beneath My coolest scorn. I hate and curse this weakness. Yet let me see herâIf she still has kept Her faith inviolate; fallen as I am, My ruine will be light. If otherwise, To know the worst will be soft soothing ease To this hot hell of doubt. Leonidas. I wish you, Sir, To weigh the certain peril that attends This rash adventure. Should, which heaven avert, Should Procles' guards discover you, oh think What must ensue! Think, in your fate, the Queen And Prince both ruin'd! Periander. But my Genius prompts. Fate calls; and I must on. No face of danger Can be so dreadful as the vultur-thoughts That gnaw my heart-strings. But we both are safe. The moon you see is down: and this mean babit Hides me from all suspicion. Who will dream Of finding Periander in this russet? This, when the storm first rose, I threw around me; That if I perish'd in it, and my corpse Were cast ashore, at least my vulgar fate Might ever rest unknownâBut hark what sounds? Leonidas. Thus that curst Tyrant revels out the night In triumph o'er your ruine.âLet me think. Yes; it may be. Now Riot rules the hour, And all good order is relax'd: we may Pass on unquestion'd. Come, my gracious Lord, This way our path lies. May some friendly God Walk with us, and throw tenfold darkness round. SCENE III. Eurydice alone. O night of ruine, horror, and despair! Walks there beneath thy universal shade A wretch like me undone? All-ruling Gods! Why have I liv'd to this? Why was my crime Visited on the guiltless head? on him For whom my soul would have met death with joy? Where shall I turn my eyes? What hope remains To misery like mine? Oh! I am lost Beyond the hand of heaven to save me now. Leonidas returns notâ SCENE IV. Eurydice, Melissa. Melissa. Gracious Gods Defend my royal Mistress! As I watch'd Without for good Leonidas, this moment I saw the Tyrant cross the lower court, Preceded by his Minion: as new risen From the mad midnight's feast; his wanton robe Loose-flowing from behind, and on his head A festal wreath of rosesâAh! he's here. SCENE V. Procles, Eurydice, Melissa, Medon. Procles. Hail young-ey'd God of wine! parent of joys! Frolic, and full of thee (while the cold sons Of Temperance, the fools of thought and care, Lie stretch'd in sober slumbers) we, the few Of purer flame, exalt each living hour With pleasures ever new.âEurydice! Thou queen of souls! thou rapture of my vows! What means this pensive mood? O quench not thus In fruitless tears those eyes, that wont to smile With all Love's sweetness, all his dewy beams, Diffusing life around thee. Eurydice. Hence, thou tyrant, And leave me to my sorrows. Ills like mine Would draw remorse and reverence from the savage, Who howls with midnight wolves amid the desart In quest of horrid prey. What then art thou? Whose brutal rage adds bitterness to woe, And anguish to the breaking heart! Procles. 'Tis well. Yet have a care: my temper but ill brooks Upbraiding now. Be wise, and timely seize The minute of good fortune, that by me Invites thee to be blest. Eurydice. Talk'st thou of bliss? Thou bane of all my happiness! Cast back, Cast back thy guilty eyes, and view the crimes Thy soul stands charg'd with: view my bleeding wrongs, Insult, imprisonment, dishonour, ruine! All, all this guilt is thineâbut heaven will find thee. Those Gods whom thou hast proudly set at nought, Will call thee to a dreadful reckoning. Procles. No. The Gods and I are friends: they crown my cause With their best favour. Come, be thou too mine, And imitate the great example set thee. Eurydice. Thou vain and blind in soul! The righteous Gods, Oft, in their anger, cloathe the worst of men With all the pride of fond prosperity, To make his fall more terrible. Procles. Confusion! Still wayward and perverse!âOff then this tameness, These supple, fawning arts. By all th'impatience That goads my soul, I will not flatter more. Know thou art in my power, andâ Eurydice. Tyrant, no. I scorn thy base unmanly threatsâAh heaven! Dost thou look calmly on?âBut be it so. This friendly dagger sets me free. [attempting to stab herself. Procles. Ha! what, What means thy frantic passion? This is wildness, Th'extravagance of female wilfulness. It must not be: you shall be gently forc'd To live, and to be happy. SCENE VI. Eurydice, Procles, an Officer, &amp;c. Officer. Sir, forgive This rude intrusion. What I bring imports Your present ear. As now I walk'd the round Of this wide fort, where the steep-winding path Ends at the northern gate, I spy'd a stranger, Who sought to lie conceal'd. Forthwith I rous'd The nearest watch; and, ere he was aware, Surrounded him at once. His sullen silence, And hands oft rais'd to heaven with earnest action, Convince me he is of no common note. Eurydice aside. My soul! what dost thou hear? Procles. 'Tis well. I thank thee. Haste, see him brought before us. SCENE VII. Periander guarded, Eurydice, Procles, &amp;c. Eurydice aside. Oh ye Powers! Periander aside. Ha! poison to my eyes! Procles. I know him not. His dress is poor, and speaks him of the vulgar. He seems to labour with some stormy thought, That deeply shakes his frame. What art thou? say Why at this hour of silence lingring here? Ha! speak, resolve me; or the rack shall tear Confession from thy pangs. Periander aside. Fate, thou hast caught me! But all is equal now. [to him. Then see before thee The man on earth whom thou hast injur'd most. If guilt can know remorse, what must thou feel At sight of Periander? Procles. Periander! Eurydice. Now, now, we both are ruin'd. Procles. Heaven, I thank thee. I form'd but one supreme, one crowning wish, And thou hast heard it! This is more than triumph! Eurydice. O! my lov'd Lordâ Periander. Thou canst no more betray me, For thee, my soul still unsubdu'd and free, Disdains to parle with thine. Procles. Yet thou art fallen Beneath my wrath, the vassal of my nod, To be chastis'd for mirthâGuards, drag him hence, And plunge him in the dungeon's depth. Periander. Away, Unkingly boaster. Can prosperity Debase thee to the cowardice of insult? Thy brutal manners well revenge me on thee: They shew thee as thou artâMy nobler part, Th'immortal mind, thy madness cannot reach: Thy whips and racks can there impress no wound. And for this weary carcass in thy power, It is beneath my care. Lead to my dungeon. Chains, scourges, torture, all that Nature feels, Or fears abhorrent, cannot shock my thought Like thy loath'd sight, and that vile Woman's. On. SCENE VIII. Eurydice, Procles, Melissa, Medon. Eurydice. My lord, my husband, stayâOh hear me! hear meâ Shame! rage! distraction!âCruel tyrant, off. I'll follow him to death. Procles. No. By the joys That swell my soaring thought, you shall not scape me. Revenge and love combine to crown this night With matchless bliss. Eurydice. Inhuman! hast thou eyes? Hast thou a heart? and cannot all this wreck Of ruin'd majesty, ruin'd by thee, Move one relenting thought, and wake thy pity? He feels not what I say: repeated crimes Have savag'd his remorseless soul.âHear then, Almighty Jove! behold, and judge the cause Of Periander! number all his wrongs In plagues, in horrorsâ Procles. Ha! by hell, this raving But wings his fate. Since thy fond folly weds thee To ruine with this rival, know he dies; This very night he dies. Thro' him I mean To wound thy heart indeed. Thou shalt behold him When the rack stretches strong his rending joints, Bursts all his veins, and hunts the flying soul Thro' every limb. Then, when convulsive agony Grins hideous in his face, mangled and bleeding, In the last throes of death, thou shalt behold him. Eurydice. It is not to be borne! My life dies in me At the destroying thoughtâAh stay thee, Proclesâ Assist me, pitying heaven!âSee then, behold me Thus prostrate at thy feet. If thou hast not Renounc'd all manhood, feeling, and remorse, Spare me his life; save only that: all else, His crown, his throne be thine. Procles. Off, let me go. Thy words are lost in air. Eurydice. Nay hear me, Procles. As is thy hope in heaven's forgiving goodness, Shut not thy heart against the cry of misery. Banish us any whither; drive us out To shame, want, beggary, to every woe That most embitters lifeâI yet will bless thee, Forget my crying wrongs, and own thee merciful. Procles aside, and pausing. This woman fools my rageâbut to resolve. Noâyes: it shall be so. Rise then, and learn Thy triumph o'er my soul. Yes he shall live, This Periander whom I deadly hate. Nay more, he shall be free. Leonidas, With such safe conduct as thyself shalt name, Attends him to our kingdom's farthest limit. This, in the sight of Jove the supreme Lord, I swear to do; so thou at last consent To meet my loveâHa! what! and dost thou frown? Weigh well what I propose; for on my soul, His life, or death, awaits thy next resolve. SCENE IX. Eurydice, Melissa. Eurydice. Then kill me firstâHe's gone! and now, ye Gods, Is there among the wretched one so lost, So curst as I? O scene of matchless woes! O Periander! wert thou sav'd for this? Ye holy Powers in heaven! to whom belongs The fate of vertue, and redress of wrongs, Assist, inspire me how to save his life; Or to th'unhappy husband join the wife. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Eurydice, Melissa. Melissa. This chearless morning rises slow and sad. The frowning heavens are black with stormy clouds; And, o'er the deep, a hovering night of fogs Lies dark and motionless. Eurydice. That mournful face Of nature is less gloomy than my soul: All there is darkness and dismay. Ah me! Was ever night, Melissa, like the last? A night of many terrors, many deaths! How has my soul out-liv'd it? But, great Gods! Can mortal strength, can human vertue bear What Periander feels? In one day's course Wreck'd, made a captive, sunk into a dungeon, To die or live as his curst foe decrees! Distraction's in the thought. And what can I To save his sacred life? [After a pause. Ha! is it heaven That darts this sudden light into my soul? This glimpse of dawning hope?âIt shall be try'd. Yes, yes, ye Powers! my life and fame shall both Be offer'd up to save his dearer life. Melissa. Alas, what mean you, Madam? Eurydice. Mean, Melissa? To do a noble justice on myself; A deed for which, in nations yet unborn, Chaste wives and matrons shall renown my name. I have wrong'd my husband greatly, and I mean Ample atonement of my guilty weakness. Go then, Melissaâ Melissa. Whither must I go? I tremble at your words. Eurydice. Yet it sticks here, This fatal purpose. Can I leave behind me A doubtful name, insulted, wounded, torn By cruel Calumny? I can; I dare Throw off the woman, and be deaf to all Those nicer female fears that call so loud, Importunate, and urging me to live Till I may clear my truth from all surmize. Go then, and in my nameâ'Tis worse than death To utter itâbut go, inform the Tyrant, So Periander lives, and is set free, I yield me to his wish. Melissa. Forbid it heaven! Eurydice. Thou faithful vertuous maid! Know then my last, My fix'd resolve. By this I mean to amuse His brutal hopes, and save me from his violence, Till Periander is beyond his reach. Then, if he still dare urge his impious purpose, A dagger sets me free. This arm at last Shall do me right on him, myself, or both. SCENE II. Eurydice, Leonidas. Eurydice. Leonidas! Leonidas. Ah Madam! Eurydice. Dare I ask Where Periander isâah where indeed? Chain'd in a dungeon's airless depth, amid Foul damps, and lonesome darkness! Oh that thought Draws blood from my torn heart. Leonidas. Justice divine! In thy great day of visitation, mark This man of blood. O let him feel the hand He dares to disbelieve. To all his counsels Send forth, in thy just wrath, that fatal Spirit Of error and illusion, that foreruns The fall of guilty kings. Ere morning-dawn, Soft to the dismal dungeon's mouth I stole, Where, by the glimmerings of a dying lamp I saw my great unhappy Master laid On the cold earth alongâ Eurydice. O hide the sad The fatal image from me. The dire thought Will run me into madness. Leonidas. Yet even there, Where pale Dismay, the prisoner's drear associate, Sits ever sad and sleepless, he could rest. Superior to the cruel fate that crush'd him, He slept as deep as Indolence on down. These eyes beheld it: and I would not break His wish'd repose, but fix'd in silent wonder, Stood weeping o'er the sight. Eurydice. Ah me! my life Flows out at every word: What's to be done? Leonidas. Madam, I set my all at stake for him. Old as I am, and broken with the load Of threescore years, what is a life like mine, But as it may be useful to my Master? Already the sad people know his fate: And I, by faithful hands, will try to rouze Their pity first, and next their rage. No hour, No moment shall be lost. Eurydice. Thou good old man! What words can speak thy worth? Fair loyalty And faith inviolate, which seem'd quite lost Among mankind, live in thy vertuous bosom. Leonidas. No more of this, my Queen. Might I but see This haughty Tyrant, in some guilty hour Of insolence and riot, when his pride Plumes all her vainest wishes, hurl'd at once To ruine unforeseen; my labours then, My services were greatly over-paid. Eurydice. Heaven hear thy pious wish. I too the while, To save my husband's life, have been contrivingâ Leonidas. Madam, the TyrantâI will find another More favourable moment. SCENE III. Procles, Medon, Leonidas. Procles. Hold thy self Prepar'd, Leonidas: I must employ thee In an affair of weight. [Leonidas withdraws. Methinks I droop With more than wonted heaviness of heart. But I will shake it off, and to the winds Give every thought of care. 'Tis only fondness, And fancy sick with hope. Eurydice Bends to my wishes: and, in her, I hope That heaven imagin'd, that sole bliss, which yet My search could never meet. Medon. It moves my wonder To see your love thus wedded to one bosom: While all around bright crouds of rival beauties Practise each art of charming, look, and talk, And live for you alone. Procles. Alas, my friend, Poor is the triumph over hearts like these: This hour they pleases us, and the next they pall. But to subdue the pride that scorns to yield; To fill th'unwilling breast with sighs and longings, With all the soft distraction of fond love, Even while it strives against th'invading victor, And wonders at the change; that, that is conquest! The plume of pleasure! and from her alone A glory to be won. Medon. Well, may you find In this proud fair one that enchants you thus, Whate'er Imagination's fondest eye Beholds in rapturous vision; or young Love In all his wantonness of power can give. But yet, forgive your servant's forward zeal, Mean you to keep the promise you have made her? Procles. I do. Medon. How Sir! what set her husband free? Procles. I mean no less. Medon. Your pardon, Sir: 'tis well. But have you calmly weigh'd in reason's scale The certain consequence? Set free your rival! A soul made furious with his mighty wrongs; Boiling with hate, rage, jealousy, revenge; With the full-gather'd storm of deadly passions! The Gods forbid it, SirâAnd all to dry A froward woman's tears! Procles. No, no, my friend; Nor liberty nor life shall long be his: I never meant him either; but my faith Is pass'd to set him free. By that alone The haughty Queen was overcome: and I Will keep th'illusive promise to her ear, But break it to her hope. Medon. As how, my Lord? Procles. Such inbred enmity my soul bears his As Nature does to ruine; to the grave, Where the whole man descends to rise no more. Hear then what I intend. Thou know'st the fortress, That guards our frontier on the Theban side. That way our foe must pass; but thou shalt first Post thither on the spur with wary speed: And with a chosen band, drawn from the fort, Way-lay him on the farther hill, close couch'd In the deep covert of those pendant woods, That shade the path below. Medon. Conclude it done. Sleep shall not know my eyes, till his are clos'd In everlasting night. As to his prison I waited him, he call'd me minion, slave, A traitor's parasite, the base-soul'd minister Of his loose pleasures: and I will repay him, For each opprobrious name, a mortal stab. Yes, he shall feel his fate. Insult and taunt, Embittering every blow, shall mock his pangs, And give him sevenfold death. Procles. So, now to try This Periander thoroughly. Go, Medon, Command him hither. SCENE IV. Procles alone. No. I cannot bear His last night's haughty look and untam'd spirit. It baffles my revenge, and I still miss My noblest triumph; for I meant to bend him To base dejection, and to feast my scorn With his pale cheek and supplicating eye. But I will hunt this pride thro' each recess, Each closer folding of the soul, till I Have sunk him to my wish.âThou Jealousy! Almighty tyrant of the human mind, Who canst at will unsettle the calm brain, O'erturn the seated heart, and shake the man Thro' all his frame with tempest and distraction; Rise to my present aid: call up thy Powers, Thy furious fears, thy blasts of dreadful passion, Thy whips, snakes, mortal stings, thy host of horrors; Rouse thy whole war against him, and compleat My purpos'd vengeance.âBut he comes to prove it. SCENE V. Periander, Procles, Medon, Guards. Procles advancing. I have to talk with thee. Thy life, thou know'st, Depends upon my willâ Periander. And therefore I Am weary of the load. But let the Gods, Who thus dispense our fates, account for them, And vindicate their justice. Procles. Be more calm. The noble mind meets every chance of fortune, Unruffled and serene. I, tho' thy foe, Perhaps may mean thee good. Periander. Such good the Tyger, Hungry for death and slaughter, means his prey. But know my soul receives with equal scorn Thy hate and hollow love. I am not fallen By thy superior sword, or nobler deed: It was the guilt of fate! Procles. Call we it so. At least 'tis well thou must of force acknowledge Thy crown, thy liberty, thy life and death, Hang on my nod. I can dispose of all As likes me best. Periander. Ha! dost thou boast of that? But thou wilt never know how poor a purchase Is power and empire gain'd for vertue lost. Procles. And yet, methinks, I read the difference plain In thee and me. Thy vertue and these bonds I weigh in equal scale against the crown And sceptre of fair Corinth: and while these, The glorious aim of each great heart that dares Beyond the narrow sphere of earth-born spirits; While these are mine, I envy not thy tribe A sound, an empty name. Periander. It joys my soul To find the man, who bears me mortal hate, At war too with the Gods. 'Tis great revenge! Had not vain fortune made thee blind, the thought Would change thy purple to the mourner's sack-cloath. What are thy glorious acts?âThou hast undone A woman, weak and worthless.âYes, ye Powers! This heroe, this fair warrior, well deserv'd To fill my vacant seat: he won it nobly! Dissembling, perjury, the coward's armsâ With these he fought his vertuous way to empire. Thou seest I know thee. Procles. Dost thou preach to me The pedant-maxims of those sons of earth, Whom the gross vulgar fondly title wise? Slaves, who to shades and solitude condemn'd, Pine there with all-shun'd Penury and Scorn. A monarch is above them, and takes counsel Of his unbounded will, and high ambition, That counts the world his own. I ever held thee My foe, my deadly bane: and against such, Force, fraud, all arts, are lawful. I have won, And mean to wear thy crown. Thou may'st the while Seek some vile cell out, and grow poorly old Amid the talking tribe of moralists. Periander. Thro' this false face of arrogance, I read Thy heart of real terror and dismay. Hence all these coward-boasts. The truly brave, Invincible to pride and fortune's flattery, Know neither fear, nor insult.âBut I would not, As thou surmizest, dream out useless life In Sloth's unactive couch. Nay I could tell thee, That tho' I shun thy shameful ways of conquest; Still heaven-born glory, won by vertuous deeds, Has been my fair pursuit: still would I seek her In toils of war, and in the nobler field Of justice, peace, and mercy. Procles. My soul longs To prove thy highest daring, and to meet thee Amid the din and peril of the battle. Thy life is in thy hand: thou art no longer Our prisoner. This moment sets thee free. Periander. How!âbut thou dare'st notâCould I find thee there, In open day, and honourable arms, Opposing war to war, as monarchs should; I would forgive thee all, my crown usurp'd, These slave-like bondsâBut that fair hope is vain. The fears that haunt thy soulâ Procles. Strike off his fetters. [to Medon. Haste, find Leonidas. Bid him prepare To guard the prisoner to our kingdom's frontier. There he shall leave him free to chuse what course His fancy most affects. Periander. What means all this? Dares Guilt then be so brave? and dost thou free The man whom act of thine shall never win To owe thee aught but deep and deadly hate? Procles. Go, see my orders instantly perform'd. [Medon and Guards retire. Periander aside. And is it soâI shudder with my fears. Say, tell me first to what is Periander Indebted for this freedom? Procles. Well it may Surprize thy hope: 'twas what I never meant thee. But that fond woman who enslaves my soul To all her wishes, and still pitys thee, With idle blandishments extorted from me A solemn vow to set thee free. Periander. Confusion! Procles. Thus I, against my better mind, release My mortal enemy. But let it speak The greatness of my love: and what dull husband, Thro' all recorded time, e'er gave such proof Of matchless fondness? Periander. Plagues! perdition! hell! Damn'd, damn'd adultress!âVillain, slave, 'tis false: Thou ly'stâWhat thee! O curseâ Procles. At last 'tis done. SCENE VI. Periander alone. Have I then liv'd to this? to this confusion? My foe, the man on earth my soul most loaths, Rejoices over me: and sheâeven she Hath join'd his triumph!âOff, away, be gone Love, manhood, reasonâCome, ye sister-Furies! Daughters of hate and hell! arise, inflame My murderous purpose; pour into my veins Your gall, your scorpion-fellness, your keen horrors That sting to madness; till my burning vengeance Hath her full draught of bloodâ [Walking with a disturb'd motion. But how! where am I? O this poor brain! ten thousand shapes of fury Are whirling there, and reason is no more. Him! him! a caitif black with every vice! Debase herself to him!âthe thought is hell! Well, wellâand I, how have I doated on her Whole years of fondness! cherish'd, pleas'd, adorn'd her With all that love can giveâYet she has done this! Confusion on my follyâHa! she comes. Down, down tempestuous soul: let me be dumb, And hide this shameful conflict that unmans me. SCENE VII. Eurydice, Periander. Eurydice aside. He must not know my secret fatal purpose, That I am fix'd to die; lest his great soul Refuse a life so dearly sav'dâAnd now All Powers that pity human kind assist me In this important hour! [to him. O Perianderâ And is it thus we meet again! Periander aside. Ha! see, She comes prepar'd. By hell, she weeps a lye. My rage will leap all bounds. Eurydice. My Lord, my love, I know you look on me as on the cause, The fatal cause of all your ills; too true: That guilt is mineâO would to heaven this head Had been laid low in earth ere that sad hour! Why did I shrink at ruine? why not bear All pangs, all horrors of besieging famine? Alas! my loveâBut your false faithless subjects To what have they reduc'd us? Periander. No; not they: Thou vile one, thou alone hast made me wretched. Thou! thou! whom I had treasur'd in my bosom, As my life's jewelâthou hast heap'd upon me, On this poor head, contempt and foul dishonour. Eurydice. Just Gods! what means my Lord? Periander. Mean!âdost thou ask? Eurydice. Heaven! has the Traitor thenâ Periander. Ha! does that gaul thee? Perdition! shall I stabâBut what? shall she, A woman, shake my soul's firm temper thus? I will be dumb. Yet noâYes he, thy minion, The base one, has repaid thy broken faith With equal perfidy: has loudly boasted To heaven, and earth, and me, how vile thou art Shame! death! distraction!âI too am become A proverb of reproach, a tale, a word For ribbald Scorn to mock at. Eurydice aside. O dire error! Fatal mistake! Now am I lost indeed. But be it so: what is my life and fame To saving him? Periander aside. See! guilt has struck her dumb. Eurydice. My lord, my only love, by holy faith I never was disloyal. Rags and penury, Disease and death, shock not my apprehension Like that detested crimeâI dare no more. O fly, my love; haste from this fatal place, And leave me to my fate. O save your life, While yet 'tis in your power. Periander. My life! away. And hast thou vilely barter'd for that life Thy truth, and my fair fame? By yon blest heaven, I could have borne all woes that Wretchedness Groans under; age, affliction, pining anguish: And borne them like a man. I could have smil'd At fortune's keenest rancorâBut to know My self deceiv'd in thee! there, there I sink! There manhood, reason die! Eurydice. O ye just Powers! Were ever woes like mine? What are the whips, Rack, engines, all that murderous Cruelty Hath yet contriv'dâwhat are they all to this? This infamy that kills the soul itself? Yet I will bear even this. Then here, by weeping, bleeding love I beg you, With streaming eyes, haste from this fatal place. The Tyrant may recall his word: and thenâ I cannot utter more. Periander. And thou can'st weep? Thou crocodile! These false, these lying tears Are daggers here. I goâBut dost thou hope Thy mean dissimulation hides thee from me? Thou hast dishonour'd, ruin'd me; and now My sight is hateful to thee. [returning. But say, tell me How have I merited these wrongs of thee? What was my crime? Can all-bestowing Love Do more than mine for thee?âWhen I call back The days that are no more! Thou wert my all Of happiness: my soul ne'er knew a joy That was not thine: my doating fondness lull'd Its hopes, its fears, its wishes, in thy bosom. O heaven and earth!âand yetâEurydiceâ Thou could'st forsake me! [weeps. Eurydice. Oh this is too much! Heaven knows I would have dy'd to save thy life: But we will perish both, both die together. Thy tears distract me; I will tell thee all. Periander. Curse on this weakness. I could tear these eyes From forth their orbsâThou exquisite deceiver! Hence, lest this arm should do a deed of shame, And stain me with thy blood. Eurydice. O but one moment, For mercy's sake, allow me one short moment. Periander. No. In the sight of all-beholding Jove, Here I renounce thee. What a slave to folly, To thy curst arts has Periander liv'd! Eurydice. O cruel! cruel! hast thou cast me out For ever from thy heart? By all our loves; By the dear pledge of our unspotted flames, Grant me one moment. [kneels. Here will I hang; grow to thy kneesâYes, spurn me; Drag this bare bleeding bosom on the ground; Yes, use me as the vilest slaveâbut hear me. Periander. Away, away. Eurydice. Then strike me dead at once. Look here, my love; I shrink not from the blow. Periander. That were poor vengeance. No; I meditate A nobler sacrificeâ [alarm of trumpets. Ha! what is this? [alarm again. Th'alarm is urgent, big with war and dread. I am the sport of fortune. SCENE VIII. Periander, Eurydice, Melissa. Melissa. O! my Lord, Some wonderous birth of fate is sure disclosing. Procles calls out to arms: his guards swarm round him, Haste in each step, and fear in every eye. This way too Medon speeds, and in his train A gloomy band of soldiers. Periander. Let him come. Death has no terrors, when to live is shame. SCENE IX. Periander, Eurydice, Melissa, Medon at the head of one party who hurry the Queen off the stage, Leonidas at the head of another who remove the King. Medon. Be quick, secure the Queen. Eurydice. What mean'st thou, ruffian? Must we then part?âFarewel, my Lord, for ever. Periander. Thou too, Leonidas!ânay thenâ SCENE X. Leonidas alone. O Jove! Eternal and supreme, whose nod controuls The fate of empires; whose almighty hand Sustains the weak, and raises vertue fallen, Now to this royal sufferer deal thy mercy: Aid his just arms, and teach mankind to know That sovereign justice sways the world below. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Eurydice, Melissa. Eurydice. What may this mean? The gloomy band of ruffians, That bore me hence, vanish'd I know not how. And hark! no sound, no breath of human voice; But all around the depth of solitude! A dumb and death-like stillness! My soul trembles: And Apprehension peoples the lone void With fears of horrid formâBut what can fate? What can the wrath of all the Gods inflict Beyond what I have known? Melissa. My gracious Mistress, This awful moment is perhaps the crisis Of all your future life. Your guards fled sudden: And late the neighbouring courts were loud with tumult, Which dy'd away in slow and sullen murmurs. Some turn of fate is near. Leonidas In haste bore hence the king, doubtless to save him From his dire foe: or at the people's head Once more to place their sovereign, and restore You to your former state. Eurydice. All otherwise My thoughts forebode. There is one deadly ill, Which oh too sure no time, no chance can heal! And at the dawn of day, just as these lids Reluctant clos'd to rest, Arpasia's Shade, My much-lov'd mother, stood confess'd before me, Pale as the shroud that wound her clay-cold limbs; Her eyes fix'd on me, still and motionless, Streaming unreal tears. She groan'd, and thrice In low, sad murmurs bade me to her tomb, To meet her thereâand there, in death alone, In the dark grave, can poor Eurydice Expect repose. Melissa. O no; just heaven, I hope, That sees your innocence, has yet in store Much bliss and many days of peace for you. Eurydice. I know his heart is quite estrang'd, and shut, For ever shut against the voice of love: And can my heart survive it? Shall I live With public infamy? a theme of scorn To all licentious tongues? Oh! in that thought, Death's keenest dart has stab'd my soul already; And what comes after is not worth my fear. Melissa. Ha! Madam, this way cast your eyes, and see What swarms of men; these flying, those pursuing. Eurydice. Now, Lord of battles! join thy powerful arm; Assert the cause of righteousnessâBut hark! The thunder of their shouts grows near and loud. This way the combat turns. By all my hopes, The Tyrant's party flies. Look, look, Melissa, Their broken numbers to the fortress bend. Melissa. And now with eager speed they climb th'ascent That leads to us. Eurydice. But who is he, Melissa, That like the God of war, flames foremost yonder? See his sword lighten, and the foe fly scattering From his tempestuous arm!âHaâyesâO heaven! 'Tis he, 'tis he himself, 'tis Periander! O miracle! He looks again a monarch, Dreadfully glorious. Throw, ye Powers! your shield Of providence before him; think on all His causeless wrongs, and do him justice now. Melissa. Ah! Procles comes. SCENE II. Procles followed by a party of his guards, Eurydice, Melissa. Procles. Confusion! all is lost. That Traitor has undone me: and those slaves, The false Corinthians, in a moment's flight, Threw all their gates wide open to the foe. Of hope abandon'd, and the Gods against me, What now remains?âThe Queen! by heaven 'tis well: Their boasted triumph is not yet compleat. She's mine, she's mine; and I am conqueror still! You, bear this woman thro' the postern-gate [to one party. Down to the southern shore: I sail this moment For Epidaurus. You, the while make head [to another. Against the near pursuit, and bar its progress Till she's secur'd. This is my last great stake, Of dearer price than victory. Away. Eurydice. No, Tyrant: I will die first. Off, base slaves. Dare ye, dare earth-born peasants violate, With your rude touch, the majesty of kings? Ah! heavenâ Procles. Be quick, nor listen to her raving. SCENE III. Eurydice, Procles, Medon, &amp;c. Medon. Undone! undone! The postern-gate is seiz'd. That curst Leonidasâ Procles. Ha! say'st thou, Medon? Medon. By hell, our foes surround us on each hand. We're taken in the toil. Procles. Unequal Powers! And have you then deceiv'd me? rais'd me high With traiterous kindness, but to plunge me deeper In howling desperation? Does the man, Whom late my foot could spurn, behold my fall? And fall I thus? my great ambition dash'd? My love unsatisfy'd? Shall he yet revel In her fond arms, and hear her curse my name? No. Spite of heaven my ruine shall be glorious, A pomp of horrors. I will make this day For ever mournful to his aking heart. Yes, he shall weep in blood amid the shouts Of victory. One blow destroys his triumph, And levels him at once to my destruction. [he draws a dagger. Eurydice. Strike, Tyrant, and compleat thy monstrous crimes. See, thou pale coward, see a woman braves Thy guilty dagger. Procles. Ha! what's this I feel? A shivering dew of horror sweats all o'er me! Some Power invisible arrests my arm! It is heaven's secret handâBut shall I lose This only moment? No: be strong my heart; Be shut against all human thoughts, and scorn These warnings of thy hostile Godsâ'Tis done. SCENE IV. Polydore and soldiers, Procles, Eurydice, Leonidas, &amp;c. Polydore pushing back Procles with his lance. No, traitor, murderer, no. Heaven is more just Than to permit a life so much its care To fall by thy vile hand. Secure the Tyrant. [to his soldiers. My mother! Eurydice. O my son! Polydore. Transporting joy! Eurydice. O ecstacy! and do I see thy face? And do I hold thee in my trembling arms? Thou darling of my love! thou early heroe! O thou hast sav'd us all! Polydore. This, this is triumph! And I can ask of bounteous heaven no more. Was ever joy so full? This feeble arm, O pride to think! has sav'd the sacred lives From whom I drew my own. Eurydice. And is this possible? What shall I say?âBut language all is poor To speak the tender yearnings of my soul. O Polydore! did ever parents know Such transports as do thine? Did ever son Deserve so well of parents?âGood Leonidas, I saw thee not before; indeed I could not: My eyes, my soul, were so close fix'd on him. But say, redouble this day's bliss, and say, Whence this amazing change? Leonidas. My royal Mistress, The Gods have done this. One half of the fleet, As led by their peculiar hand, escap'd Yesterday's ruinous storm, and with the dawn Enter'd the port unseen; their secret landing Befriended by the morn's wide-hovering mists. Instant, inform'd of his great father's fate, Your Polydore, this gallant royal youth, Pour'd forth his eager troops; and at their head, Swift as heaven's darted fire, flew towards Corinth, Which open'd wide her arms to take him in. His fortune speaks the rest. Eurydice. O sovereign Goodness! Be thine the praise: this is thy wonderous work. The King, how was he sav'd? Leonidas. Struck with this danger, The Tyrant had to present death devoted His sacred head. I counsel'd, and prevail'd (Procles still thought me his) in bonds to hold him As our sure pledge of safety, should success Desert our arms. The following moment saw him Free from his chains, and foremost in the fightâ And hark! these joyous strains proclaim his triumph. Eurydice. Retire, my son; I would not meet him here. SCENE V. Periander attended, Leonidas, Ariston, Procles, Medon. Periander aside. She flies!âThou coward, Guilt!âbut hence that thought. [advancing towards Procles. At length the measure of thy crimes is full: Thy high-plum'd pride lies humbled in the dust; And awful Justice comes, array'd in terrors, To make enquiry for the guilt that swells Thy black accountâBut I will check my heart, Nor learn of thee to triumph o'er the fallen. Bear him to prison. Procles. Yet, I will be free, And soon beyond thy power. Knowing the worst, I laugh at all to come. Periander to Medon. For thee, thou vile one, Thou pander to thy Master's lusts, thou sycophant, (The most pernicious present angry heaven Can make to princes whom it means to blind, And ruin beyond mercy) thy just doom Is instant. Spurn this slave into the streets. The furious people, whom his earth-born pride Has trampled on, and numerous rapines beggar'd, Will find th'oppressor out, and as they tear His guilty limbs, think all their wrongs o'er-paid. SCENE VI. Periander, Leonidas, Ariston. Periander. Leonidas, my father and preserver, Rise to my arms. By heaven the joy that smiles Upon thy brow adds brightness to the morn. This wonderous revolution of my fate, This change that gives me back my crown and name, Rejoices me yet less, than that I owe The gift to thee. Leonidas. O sacred Sir, forbear. The transport to behold you thus again Is great reward. Now your old man can say He has not liv'd in vain. Ye bounteous Powers! Dismiss me now in peace; for I have seen My Master blest! Periander. No recompence can equal Such matchless goodness. But I will repay thee A way more pleasing to a soul like thine, By running still in debt to all thy vertues. Thou know'st th'unhappy, envy'd state of kings; How perilous the height so near to heaven, Ten thousand ways expos'd: here to the lust Of lawless will; there to the darker ruine Of venal flattery. Be near me still. Thy life has roll'd thro' all the various round Of human chance: and years of hoary thought, Cool and unpassionate, have taught thee wisdom. Be still my guide, and save me from the snares That thus beset me; save me from myself. Leonidas. My heart can only answer to this goodness By silent gratitude and joyâBut, Sir, Forgive me if I say, another care Demands your present thought. Periander aside. Fatal remembrance! At once inflam'd my smother'd rage burns up With fiercer blaze. He must not know the purpose With which my bosom labours. [to him. Yes, my friend, Of that we'll talk anon; but now I wish An hour of privacy.âAriston, stay, SCENE VII. Periander, Ariston. Periander. Thus far have I repress'd the storm within me; Held down its furious heavings: but they now Shall have full flow. I am once more a king. My foe is in my hand, and breathes this air But till I doom him dead: yet is not he So curst, so ruin'd as his conqueror! Ariston. What do I hear, my Lord? Periander. Ah! good Ariston, The horrors of thy tale were true. She has, She has betray'd me. Ariston. Since the Queen is fallen, There is no trust in womanâ Periander. Nor no hope For wretched Periander. Not the grave Can hide me now from scorn: not length of days Will wear out this. O never-dying shame! Worlds yet unfound will hear it: and where'er The guilty tale is told, my fate will raise Base mirth, or baser pity. Ariston. Could the Queen Stoop to a thought of Procles? False fond sex! Unfix'd by reason, ever wandering wild, As Fancy whirls, from folly on to folly, From vanity to vice. My gracious Lord, She is beneath your anger. Cast her out From all your soul, and be yourself again. Resume that reason, Sirâ Periander. Away: can reason Arrest the whirlwind's wing? or quench the forest, Struck by the hand of Jove, when all its woods In one broad conflagration blaze to heaven? 'Tis reason makes me wretched; for it tells me How shameful this mad conflict of my passions: But does that still their uproar? Here, Ariston, Works the wild storm that reason cannot calm. I must, I will have ease. Ariston. You may; but oh! The remedy is dreadful, and will give you Swoonings and mortal agonies. I tremble To mention it; but such your soul's deep malady, No gentler cure can bring the health you want. Her death, my Lordâ Periander. Ha! deathâmy soul shrinks back From the dread image. How! for ever lose her! My queen! my wife! behold those eyes no more That were the light of mine! no longer hear That voice whose every sound was harmony! Of power to sooth tumultuous Rage, and heal The wounded heart of AnguishâCan it be? O misery! why, why is this? Ariston. Alas! You love her still, my Lord, and know it not. Periander. Ye Gods, why am I thus? driven to and fro By every blast that blows?âIt is too true. A traiterous softness steals o'er my just rage, And melts me to the dotage of low pity. O thou mean heart! Is she not false? And I, Shall I sit down with tame dishonour? take Pollution to my arms? grow vilely old, A tale for drunkards in their wine? the mirth Of midnight libertines, when they recount Their triumphs o'er base women? No: she dies. I tear her from my breast, tho' the life-stream Should issue with her. Hear me then, Ariston, Do thou prepare a secret draught of death, Of power most swift and baneful; and be ready Upon my fatal summons. Ariston. Spare me, Sir; I like not this employ. Periander. It must be thine. I have no friend in whom to trust but thee: And she shall dieâBut think'st thou, good Ariston, I should not hear her first? Ariston. Hear her, my Lord? Would you then have her live? Periander. No; were my fate Involv'd in hers, she should not live. But still Something within me crys that I should hear her. It is not, can't be love. 'Tis my revenge, All direful now, that would enjoy her tears, Her lying oaths of innocence, her new And added perjuries: then sink her down To the dark world, with all her crimes upon her. Ariston. You see not, Sir, the danger of that meeting. Is your heart proof against the powerful charm Of beauty soften'd into sighs, and melting With the mild languor of imploring eyes, More winning now, and shedding gentler beams Thro' showers of sorrow. Think you here behold her, The kneeling charmer lovely in her tears, Pleading for pity, sinking at your feet, And dying by your frown. Periander. Art thou my friend? O merciless! why dost thou raise before me This dangerous image? 'Tis not to be borne. My brain turns round with madness. O ye Powers! Why am I not at quiet? Why is life Forc'd on the wretch who strongly begs to die, In bitterness of soul? who asks no more But the grave's shade and silence, there at last To sleep for ever, nameless and forgotten? Ariston. Alas for pity! I will talk no more On this distressful theme. Periander. Ariston, stay. Spite of these tears, spite of this fond distraction, It shall be done. A king may live unhappy But not with loss of honour unreveng'd. 'Twas mad to think of this. I will not trust My eyes against the witchcraft of her charms. Then summon all thy firmness, O my Soul! And dare to be accurst; since thy sad choice Is shame, or misery. I am resolv'd. Ye Gods who watch o'er the chaste marriage-bed! Thou Stygian Jove! and all ye Powers infernal! Behold, I kneel as in your awful presence. By that invisible, that dreaded Lake, Th'irrevocable oath that binds even you, Here I pronounce, and seal her doom of death. SCENE VIII. Eurydice, Periander, Ariston. Eurydice kneels to Periander, who after looking on her some time with emotion, flings away without speaking. Eurydice alone. Not hear me! not vouchsafe me one poor word! 'Tis hard indeed.âThe Wretch of many crimes, [rising. Whom Mercy dares not save, is gentler us'd. His rigid judge is less severe than mine. Ye Powers! have I deserv'd this? Did my heart E'er harbour one loose wish? Your selves can tell, The morning's orient beam is not more pure, More stainless than my truth. Was ever fate, Were ever woes, like mine? Even in the hour Of general joy to all, while pleasing hope Sprung fast within my heart, I find my self Undone for ever! sunk to rise no more! Not hear meâthen I know my doom is fix'd. And shall I stay to hear the foul surmizes, The scurril taunts, the false upbraiding pity, The keen revilings, that must usher in My public sentence? Can there be in death Such pangs? such piercing agonies? Impossible. Death is repose and calm, is soft elizium To thoughts like these. I will prevent their triumph, And save myself this shame. 'Tis but to lose A few unhappy moments; 'tis to rest The sooner from my cares; to feel no more The bitterness of misery and insult That bait my weary soul. Then it is fix'd. Spite of the woman, no fond tear shall flow, No sigh arise, the coward-sex to shew. When life is shame, and glorious freedom nigh, A Grecian and a Queen must dare to die. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Periander walking disordered, Leonidas following. O my lov'd Master! have I liv'd to see This sight of woe? Alas! is this to conquer? Are these the fruits of victory? Periander. Away, Why nam'st thou victory to me, a slave Subdu'd and tyranniz'd by his worst foes, His unrelenting passions? Talk of ruine, And I will hear thee: talk of hopeless misery; No other strain befits thy master's triumph. Leonidas. This is the language of supreme distress, Impatient of itself. My gracious Lord, Forgive an old man's talk, who would this moment, Might his poor life bring back your peace of mind, With joy resign it. Periander. That were to bring back The darted sun-beam, or recall the flight Of unreturning time. O no: my soul Has bid the last farewel to happiness, To hope itself. And yet I thank thy love, Indeed I do: but leave me for a while. I would be private. Leonidas. Sir, I dare not leave youâ Forgive these tearsâI dare not leave you thus At variance with your self. I read too plain The fatal thought that wakens in your bosom. Periander. And would'st thou have me live this abject thing? This slave of folly? For I tell thee blushing, With shame and strong abhorrence of my self, I cannot tear that Woman from my soul, False, faithless as she isâThen I will die. That just revenge is still within my power. Leonidas. O Jealousy! thou merciless destroyer, More cruel than the grave! what ravages Does thy wild war make in the noblest bosoms! Too long, my Lord, you listen to the whispers Of that domestic foe, that bosom traitor. For mercy's sake, throw not away so rashly The jewel of your soul. Some unseen error Mis-leads you from the truth, and ruins her. Grant her a moment's audience. Periander. I have sworn, That she shall die. Leonidas. Is then her sacred life Of so small price, to cast her thus away With blind precipitance? Your Queen, my Lord! The fairest form, the most exalted mind! Once so ador'd and lov'd! to whom your soul Still cleaves with fondness! Can you give her up, The mother of your darling Polydore, Unheard, untry'd, to death and infamy? Can you do this? Periander. O Thou! whose eye beholds And pitys the frail heart of erring man, Ruler of heaven and earth! or still these passions, That rage in tempest here: or strike in mercy, And free me from my pain.âWhat can I do? My solemn vow is gone up to high heaven: And would'st thou have me break it? Leonidas. That rash oath Nor does, nor ought to bind. The Gods refuse it. Should you, too late, discover she is wrong'dâ Think on it wellâO what a life of horrors Remains for you! I tremble but to name 'em. The sad and silent meltings of vain sorrow; The thorn of keen remorse; the sting of love, Inflam'd by fond reflection, hourly sighing For what he never, never hopes to find: With these, late-coming, but no more to leave you, Despair accurst. Dreadful society! Yet such will share your day and night, and haunt Your court, your throne, your solitude, your couch. Alas, my Lord! Periander. O by my soul's strong anguish, I would most gladly blot out from my thoughts All memory of past time: I yet would question The waking evidence of every sense, To give her back that vertue, those fair beams That shone on our first loves. Then was I blest Beyond the race of men, belov'd and loving, Honour'd and happy; and my name as odor Pour'd forth, and breathing freshness all around. O days of dear delight! that I could fix For ever there, and think no farther on. I will if possible. Leonidas. O happy change! Confirm this gentle purpose, favouring heaven! I fly to bring her hither. Periander. Stay thee yet. I would resolve, but cannot. Love and rage By turns assail me: melt me now to mercy; Now rouse me to distractionâO my heart! Leonidas. Then punish the sole cause of all your pangs. On the great criminal, on Procles' head Discharge the fulness of a righteous vengeance, And justify the Gods. Let the rack tear The traitor's limbs; and as he howls with anguish, Extort confession from him of the lyes, The dark aspersions, that have well nigh ruin'd Your injur'd, vertuous Queen, and tortur'd you. Periander. What hast thou done? O that detested name! Thou know'st not half my madnessâthat curst name Has set my brain on blaze, and call'd up there Ten thousand furies. Hell! hast thou not heard What shame and scorn, what vileness and confusion, He heap'd upon my headâand she the cause! Leonidas. Oh heaven, and is this retribution thine? Must Vertue know, what Vice alone should feel? Periander. Forbear, fond man. That heaven thou dar'st accuse, Just, tho' mysterious, leads us on unerring, Thro' ways unmark'd, from Guilt to Punishment. I vow'd, alas! and with strong adjurations Bound that just vow, to set my country free. This, to my Father on his bed of death, Solemn I sworeâBut, O blind lust of greatness! Thro' wantonness of will I lightly weigh'd it, Nor fear'd the hour of terrible account! That hour is come: and what avails it now That I, with equal hand and gentle rule, Have sway'd my people? I am punish'd most, Where I had bid my soul be most secure Of happiness for yearsâHa! Polydore. SCENE II. Polydore, Periander, Leonidas. Periander. I said I would be private. Polydore. O my father, Here let me kneel for ever, weep these eyes To blindness, and ne'er know a thought of comfort. Periander. What would my Polydore? Polydore. Alas! what means This common face of woe that meets my sight Where'er I turn? Even now while happy Corinth Blazes with triumph; while the neighbouring shores Resound to heaven her voice of general joy, The palace is in tears. Her silent courts Are dark with mourning, as if Death and Ruine, Not Victory, had fix'd their mansion here. Periander. There is a cause, my son, a dreadful one. But leave me to myself. Polydore. Am I then grown A horror to your eyes? What is my crime, That thus with alienated look you turn As from some baleful object? Yet, my father, Oft have you sworn that in this face you saw, And lov'd your darling Queen. Periander. Away, thy looks, Thy words distract me. Polydore. Whither shall I fly? Where hide this hated head? My mother too, As now I left her, pressing full her eyes With fix'd and earnest mournfulness on mine, Stream'd into tears: then clasp'd me to her bosom With such sad passion, such transported tremblings, As parting lovers that must meet no more. I beg'd to know the cause. Again she press'd me With fonder eagerness, and sighing cry'd, Say to the King, my heart has never err'd. Periander. By heaven, my soul melts at the piteous tale. O Polydoreâ SCENE III. Periander, Polydore, Leonidas, Officer. My Lord, the prisoner Medon Attends, and prays admittance to your presence. Periander. Ha! Medon! Dost thou dream? Medon alive? Did I not charge thee strict to cast him forth That moment to the fury of the people? How hast thou dar'd to disobey? Officer. Dread Sir, As to his fate I led him pale and trembling; At sight of the tumultuous croud around, With utmost instance he requested of me To save him yet a moment; for he had Secrets of prime concernment that requir'd The King's immediate ear. We hardly scap'd Into the southern tower: th'unnumber'd rabble With cries and threats demanded forth their foe. At hazard of my life I ventur'd down, Sooth'd, flatter'd, promis'd 'em they should have justice. They are but now dispers'd. Periander. Leonidas, My heart misgives me at that miscreant's name. But let him enter. SCENE IV. Periander, Polydore, Leonidas, Medon. Medon. O King! renown'd for gentleness and mercy, The noblest praise; see prostrate at your feet A criminal, who comes to merit pardon By fair discovery of some weighty truths, That much import your soul's repose and health. Periander. Say on: and if thy heart has form'd a hope Of one hour's after-life, take heed thy tale Be strictly just to truth. Medon. Thus groveling here, With shame and sharp remorse I own my crime. Misled by that Usurper, who with me Now shares the due reward of guilt like ours, To pleasure him, unhappy that I was! I told, I know not what of your good Queen. Would I had perish'd first! for all was false, And she most innocent. Periander. Perdition on thee! What do I hear? Medon. I fill'd Ariston's ears With monstrous tales, which his plain honesty Alas, too rashly creditedâ Periander. Ye Gods! And could your thunder sleep? Pernicious slave, Hadst thou as many lives as crimes, not one Should scape my justiceâAh Leonidas, Was ever such black treachery?âForgive thee? Thy doom shall be of signal dread and warning To all succeeding Minions. Drag him hence, [to the guards. And guard him at the peril of your heads. SCENE V. Periander, Polydore, Leonidas. Leonidas. Amazing villainy! Periander. O fly, my son, Find the poor mourner out, and in my name Say all that weeping Penitence can plead, Or Love returning promise. My full heart Will more than make it goodâand may the power Of soft persuasion wait upon thy lips. SCENE VI. Periander, Leonidas. Periander. As from enchantment freed, the mists disperse By which my eyes were held.âThat injur'd Fair! How shall I meet her soft forgiving look, Whom I so much have wrong'd! Leonidas. Thrice happy turn Of unexpected fate! Periander. But let me fly Into her gentle arms! there lose the horrors That have distracted me! there lose myself In love's ecstatic joys! SCENE VII. Periander, Leonidas, Ariston. Periander. In happy time Thou com'st, Ariston. We were both deceiv'd; And I revoke my orderâBut curst Procles Shall pay me dear for all. Ariston. He has, my Lord: And the sad tale is terrible. I shrink But to recount it. Slumbering Conscience rous'd, And flashing in his face the startling prospect Of his past life, furious he dash'd his head Against his prison walls. I found him fallen, A piteous spectacle! rowling in blood, Deform'd with pain; for agonizing death Sate hideous on his brow. Faintly he drew His parting breath: yet all that breath went forth In blasphemies, assaulting heaven with curses, The ravings of despair, for frustrating His impious purpose on the Queen. Periander. How dreadful This period to a life like his! The hand Of heaven is greatly justâBut O my friends, These strange events have well nigh overturn'd This tottering brain. I feel I know not what Of joy and terror, high amaze and transport, All blended here, and working in wild tumult. Leonidas. 'Tis but the motion of a troubled sea, After sore tempest sinking to a calm. All will be well, my Lord. Repose and health Await you in her arms. What bliss is yours? A second union of your meeting souls! A better nuptial morn, with love new-rising, To shine for ever. SCENE VIII. Periander, Leonidas, Ariston, Melissa. O my royal Mistress! The dews of death are cold upon her brow! Periander. What mean thy fatal words? Melissa. Falsely accus'd Of what her soul most loaths, and to despair By your unkindness urg'd, the Queen alas! Has drunk a deadly draught. Periander. O heaven and earth! Are these at last my hopes? 'Tis IâO horror! 'Tis I have murder'd herâ SCENE the last. Scene opening discovers Eurydice sitting, Polydore kneeling by her. Periander. Ye righteous Gods! O give her back to life, and to your justice I bow this guilty headâWhat's to be done? Leonidas, Ariston, fly, my friends, Call, gather all our sages; bid them try Their sovereign skill. My crown to him that saves her. Eurydice. It cannot be. Already death invades My shivering bosom. Yet a little moment, And I shall be with those that rest for ever. But here in this last awful hour I swear, By that dread world whither my soul is parting, I never knew pollution: I am still Your true and lawful wife. Periander. I know thou art, Thou dying innocence. My fatal blindness, Destruction on my head! has ruin'd thee. My life! my soul's best joy! and must I lose thee? Lose thee for ever?âWretch! rash fool!âO yet Forgive my madness. Eurydice. Thus, in thy lov'd arms Each unkind thought is lost. Now I die pleas'd: Now all is well.âDeath! thou art hereâ Melissa. Ah! she expires. The last dim mist swims o'er Her closing eyes! Periander. One moment, thou fair Spirit, One moment tarry for meâThus we join, To part no moreâ [he draws his sword to stab himself. Ariston. Ah! Sirâ Leonidas. My Lord, what means This fatal fury? Periander. Cruel men, away. And would you then detain me longer here On this loath'd spot, to linger out old age With darkness and despair! to curse the hour That gave a murderer birth! Would you, my friends, Have me live thus? Ariston. Ye Gods asswage his grief! Periander. These righteous Gods have cast me off for ever. My broken vow!âO terrible! it hangs, A bursting thunder, o'er my head. I seeâ And tremble at the sight, th'inquiring Judge, Beyond these heavens, high on his throne of terrors; His fix'd and dread regard turn'd full upon me! And look! behold! the Minister of vengeance But waits his nod to strike me thro' the centre. Polydore. Alas! my fatherâ Periander. O my son! my son! I have undone thee too. How dare I look On that dear face, where thy lost Mother's sweetness Smiles strong reproach, and charms me into madness? Then, farewel reason! farewel human converse! Sun, day, and time, farewel!âAll hail despair! Eternal darkness hail!âSay'st thou I've lost her? No, no; we will not part. Thus let me press Her clay-cold lips, thus weep my soul away On her chaste bosom here. O yet, my love! My better life! O yet lift up thy eyes! O speak to me! Leonidas. Alas! she hears you not. The soul is fled for ever. Periander. O my Queen! [he throws himself by the body: the rest stand weeping and silent. [raising himself up. Ha! thereâsave me! 'tis he, the King of terrors! Lo how the ghastly vision glares upon me With his fix'd beamless eyes!âWhat path is this, Dreary and deep, thro' which he drags me on? Bless me!âlook thereâwhat shivering Forms are these, Thin as the passing air, that skim around me? And now th'infernal world hath shut me in! But see the Furies arm'd! see their fell serpents That rouse themselves to sting me! Is there none, No Power to screen me from them? Leonidas. Gracious Sir, Where is that patienceâ Periander. SoftâI see her plain. Yonder on high she sits amid the Gods, Who wonder at her charmsâAnd dost thou smile Upon thy murderer?âThus let me kneel, And weeping worship theeâHa! seest thou there Yon flaming pool? And what damn'd soul is that, Rising from the mid deeps, that beckons me? He wafts me stillâBy hell, 'tis hated Procles, The cause of all my ruine!âTraitor, yes, I come, I fly, to plunge thee deeper still In this red sea of torturesâO! Ariston. He dies! Polydore. O matchless horror! Leonidas. Bear him gently hence. Was ever sight like this?âO Jealousy! This is thy dreadful work. May future times Learn here thy power, and mark with heedful eyes, From thy blind rage what mighty mischiefs rise. THE END.</field>
