      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS of the DRAMA. HEGIO, an old Gentleman. PHILOCRATES of Ãlis, a Captive at Ãtolia. TYNDARUS, a Captive at Ãtolia, his Servant. ARISTOPHONTES, a Captive at Ãtolia, and Friend to Philocrates. PHILOPOLEMUS, a Captive at Ãlis, Son to Hegio. STALAGMUS, Servant to Hegio. ERGASILUS, a Parasite. A SERVANT of Hegio. A LAD, the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, CALYDON in ÃTOLIA, Before Hegio's House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. These Captives you see standing here before you, Sit not,âthey stand. You are my witnesses, Who see 'tis so, that what I say is true. Old Hegio, who lives here, calls one his son; But by what means that son is now a slave To his own father, give me your attention, And I'll explain.âThis Hegio had two sons; One, when but four years old, a slave had stolen, And, flying into Ãlis, sold him to The father of this other captive here. Thus far d'ye understand me?âIt is well.â Yet I see one at distance, who in troth Seems as he heard not.âPrithee, friend, come nearer; If not to sit, there's room at least to walk. What! would you make the player strain his voice, As if he were a beggar asking alms? Mistake not, I'll not crack my lungs for you.â But you, who from your rank have wherewithal To be assess'd, hear what I've more to say; I care not for the vulgar.âAs I told you, The slave ran off, and to this captive's father Sold his young master, whom the knave had stolen. No sooner had the old man made the purchase, Than, as their ages nearly were the same, He made him wait on his own son; and now He is a slave in his own father's house, Nor does his father know he is his son. True is it, that the Gods us mortal creatures Hold but as balls to band about in sport. How Hegio lost one of his sons, you thus Have an account.âSince that, his other son, When Ãlis and Ãtolia were at variance, Was made a prisoner by the chance of war. Menarchus, a physician, purchased him At Ãlis.âHegio, good old man, on this Began to trade for captives with the Ãlians, In hopes of finding one some time or other, With whom to barter for his son; not knowing, His present captive was in truth his son. But hearing yesterday there was a captive Of an high rank and family from Ãlis, (Since to regain his son and bring him home He spar'd no cost) this captive and his slave He purchas'd of the QuÃ¦stors from the spoil. These, that the master through his servant's means Might home return, have thought of this contrivance. They've chang'd their name and dress; and Tyndarus Is call'd Philocrates, Philocrates Call'd Tyndarus; the master personates The servant, while the servant personates The master.âTyndarus, the servant, now Will play his tricks so well, that he'll procure His master liberty. By the same means He'll save his brother too, and bring him back In freedom to his country and his father, Without design.âAnd so it happens oft In many instances; more good is done Without our knowledge, than by us intended. Thus each, unconscious of the consequence, Form'd and devis'd this trick, and this the issue Of their design, that he should be a slave To his own father; so indeed he is, But knows it not.âWhen I reflect upon it,â What creatures are we men! how insignificant!â This is the subject matter of the play We are about to represent to you. But one thing I'd remind you:âit will be To your advantage to attend our play: For 'tis not in the common stile, nor yet Like other plays:âhere are no ribald lines Unfit to be remember'd; here you'll find No infamous abandon'd courtesan; No rascal pimp, no Braggard Captain here. Be not concern'd, for that I have inform'd you The Ãlians and Aetolians are at war: Their battles will be fought without our scenes; For when our stage is fitted up with all It's comic decorations, then to aim At acting of a tragedy, would seem Strangely absurd. If therefore any here Expect a battle, let him ground his quarrel. And if perchance he light upon a foe Much stronger than himself, I'll here engage The battle he will be spectator of, Will not much suit his taste; nor will he like To look on any battle ever after. But I retire.âIn peace most upright judges, In war most valiant combatants, Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter ERGASILUS. Because I usually attend at feasts An invocated guest, our sparks forsooth Nickname me Mistress.âThis, I know, the jeerers Say is absurd.âI say, 'tis right.âThe lover At a carousal, when he throws the dice, Invokes his Mistress.âIs she invocated, Or is she not?âMost plain, she is.âBut yet, To say the truth, we are term'd Parasites For a much plainer reason.âFor, like mice, Ask'd or not ask'd, we always live upon Provisions not our own.âIn the vacation, When to the country men retire, 'tis also Vacation with my teeth.âAs in hot weather Snails hide them in their shells, and, if no dew Should chance to fall, live on their proper moisture, We Parasites, in times of the vacation, Keep ourselves snug; and while into the country Those are retired, on whom we us'd to feed, Poor we support our natural call of appetite From our own juices.âWe in the vacation Are thin as hounds;âbut when men come to town, We are as plump as mastiffs, full as troublesome, And as detested. What is worst of all, Except we patiently endure a drubbing, And let them break their pots upon our heads, We must submit to sit among the beggars Without the city gate.âThat this will be My lot, there's not a little danger, since My patron is a captive with the enemy. Th'Ãtolians and the Ãlians are at war: We now are in Ãtolia. Philopolemus, Old Hegio's son, whose house is here hard by, Is prisoner now in Ãlis.âSad indeed This house to me! which, often as I see it, Brings tears into my eyes. The good old father, Upon his son's account, not in compliance With his own inclination, has engaged In an illiberal traffic, and by purchasing Of captives hopes, that in some lucky hour He may find one to barter for his son.â But the door opens, whence I've sallied forth Full many a time, drunk with excess of cheer. SCENE II. Enter HEGIO and a Slave. Heg. Mind what I say:âfrom those two captives there, Whom yesterday I purchas'd from the QuÃ¦stors, Take off the heavy chains with which they're bound, And put on lighter: let them walk about Within doors, or abroad, as likes them best:â Yet watch them well.âA free man, made a captive, Is like a bird that's wild: it is enough, If once you give it opportunity To fly away;âyou'll never catch it after. Slave. Freedom to slavery we all prefer.â Heg. You do not think so, or you'd find the means. Slave. If I have nought to offer else, permit me To give you for it a fair pair of heels. Heg. And if you do, I presently shall find What to bestow on you. Slave. I'm like the bird You talk'd of even now.âI'll fly away. Heg. Indeed! Beware the cage then, if you do.â No more; mind what I order'd, and be gone.â Erg. (Aside.) May he succeed in his design!âIf not, And he should miss redeeming of his son, I have no house to put my head into.â Young fellows of this age are all self-lovers; I have no hopes of 'em;âbut Philopolemus, He is a youth keeps up our ancient manners:â I never rais'd in him a single smile, But I was paid for't;âand old Hegio here Is just the same.â Heg. I'll now unto my Brother's, Visit my other captives there, and see If ought has been amiss last night among them; Thence will I take me home again forthwith. Erg. It grieves me much, that this unhappy man Should act so meanly as to trade in slaves, On the account of his unhappy son; But, if by this, or any means like this, He can redeem him, let him deal in men's flesh, I can endure it. Heg. Who is it that speaks there? Erg. 'Tis I, SirâI, that pine at your distress, Grow thin with it, wax old, and waste away; Nay, I'm so lean withal, that I am nothing But skin and bone:âwhate'er I eat at home Does me no good; but be it e'er so little I taste abroad, that relishes, that cheers me. Heg. Ergasilus!âGood day. Erg. (Crying) Heav'ns bless you, Hegio! Heg. Nay, do not weep. Erg. Must I not weep for him? For such a youth not weep? Heg. My son and you, I know, were ever friends. Erg. 'Tis then at length Men come to know their good, when they have lost it;â I, since the foe has made your son a captive, Find his true value, and now feel his want. Heg. If you, who stand in no relation to him, So ill can bear his sufferings, what should I, Who am his father,âhe my darling child? Erg. I stand in no relation to him?âhe In none to me?âAh, Hegio! say not that,â And do not think so:âif he is to you A darling child, to me he's more than darling. Heg. I cannot but commend you, that you hold Your friend's mishap your own.âBe comforted. Erg. Ah me! Heg. (Half aside.) 'Tis this afflicts him, that the army, Rais'd to make entertainments, is disbanded. Could you get no one all this while, again To put it in commission? Erg. Would you think it? Since Philopolemus has been a captive, They all decline the office. Heg. And no wonder, That they avoid it.âYou will stand in need Of many soldiers, and of various kinds:â Bakerians, Pastry-cookians, Poultererians,â Besides whole companies of Fishmongerians. Erg. How greatest geniusses oft lye conceal'd! O what a general, now a private soldier! Heg. Have a good heart.âI trust, within these few days My son will be at home again: for lo! Among my captives I've an Ãlian youth Of noble family and ample state.â I trust, I shall exchange him for my son. Heg. Heav'ns grant it may be so! Heg. But are you ask'd Abroad to supper? Erg. No-where, that I know.â But why that question? Heg. As it is my birth day, I thought of asking you to sup with me,â Erg. Oh! good, Sir, goodâ Heg. If you can be content With little. Erg. Oh, Sir! very, very little:â I love it,â'tis my constant fare at home. Heg. Come, set yourself to sale. Erg. (Loud.) Who'll bye me? Heg. I,â If no one will bid more. Erg. Can I expect, I or my friends, a better offer?âSo I bind me to the bargain, all the same As though I sold you terra firma. Heg. Say, A quick-sand rather, that will swallow all.â But if you come, you'll come in time. Erg. Nay, now I am at leisure. Heg. Go, and hunt an hare:â I've nothing but an hedge-hog:âyou will meet With rugged fare. Erg. Don't think to get the better Of me by that:âI'll come with teeth well shod. Heg. To say the truth, my viands are full hard. Erg. You don't champ brambles? Heg. Mine's an earthly supper. Erg. A fine fat sow, why that's an earthly animal. Heg. Plenty of vegetables. Erg. The best thing To cure your sick with.âHave you more to say? Heg. You'll come in time. Erg. You need not put in mind, Whose memory never fails him. [Ergasilus goes off. Heg. I will in, Look over my accounts, and see what cash I have remaining in my banker's hands; Then to my brother's, where I said I'd go. [Exit. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter SLAVES of HEGIO, with PHILOCRATES and TYNDARUS. A SLAVE. If the immortal Gods have so decreed, That this affliction you should undergo, It is your duty patiently to bear it; Which if you do, the trouble will be lighter. When at your home, you I presume were free: But since captivity is now your lot, Submission would become you, and to make Your master's rule a mild and gentle one By your good dispositions.âShould a master Commit unworthy actions, yet his slaves Must think them worthy ones. Phil. and Tynd. Alas! Alas! Slave. Why this bewailing?âtears but hurt your eyes:â Our best support and succour in distress Is fortitude of mind. Phil. But oh! it shames us, That we are thus in chains. Slave. Yet might it grieve Our master more, were he to loose your chains, And let you be at large, when he has bought you. Phil. What can he fear from us?âWe know our duty, Were we at large. Slave. You meditate escape: I know what you'd be at.â Phil. We run away! Ah! whither should we run?â Slave. To your own country. Phil. Prithee no more: it would but ill become us To imitate the part of fugitives. Slave. Yet, by my troth! was there an opportunity, I would not be the man that should disuade you. Phil. Permit us then to ask one favour of you. Slave. What is it? Phil. That you'd give us opportunity To talk together, so that you yourselves, Nor any of these captives over-hear us. Slave. Agreed.â(To the Slaves.) Move further off.â(To his Companions.) We'll too retire, But let your talk be short.â Phil. 'Twas my intention It should be so.âA little this way, Tyndarusâ [To the other Captives, and retires with them. Slave. Go farther from them.â Tynd. We on this account Are both your debtors. Phil. Farther off, so please you, (To Tyndarus.) A little off, that these may not be witnesses Of what we have to say, and that our plot Be not discover'd.âFor not plann'd with art, Deceit is no deceit, but if discover'd, It brings the greatest ill to the contrivers. If you, my Tyndarus, are to pass for me, And I for you,âmy master you, and I Your servant,âwe have need of foresight, caution, Wisdom and secrecy,âand we must act With prudence, care and diligence.âIt is A business of great moment, and we must not Sleep, or be idle in the execution. Tynd. I'll be what you would have me. Phil. So I trust. Tynd. Now for your precious life you see me stake My own, that's no less dear to me. Phil. I know it. Tynd. But when you shall have gain'd the point you aim at, Forget not then!âIt is too oft the way With most men;âwhen they're suing for a favour, While their obtaining it is yet in doubt, They are most courteous, but when once they've got it, They change their manners, and from just become Dishonest and deceitful.âI now think you All that I wish, and what I do advise I would advise the same unto my father. Phil. And verily, if I durst, I'd call you father; For next my father you are nearest to me. Tynd. I understand. Phil. Then what I oft have urg'd, Remember.âI no longer am your master, But now your servant.âThis I beg then of you,â Since the immortal Gods will have it so, That I, from being once your master, now Should be your fellow slave, I do intreat, By Prayer, a favour which I could command, Once as my right.âBy our uncertain state, By all my father's kindness shewn unto you, By our joint fellowship in slavery, Th'event of war, bear me the same regard, As once I bore you, when I was your master, And you my slave; forget not to remember, What once you have been, and who now you are. Tynd. I knowâI now am You, and you are I. Phil. Forget not,âand there's hope our scheme will prosper. SCENE II. Enter HEGIO speaking to those within. When I'm inform'd of what I want to know, I shall come in again.âWhere are those captives, I order'd to be brought before the house? Phil. Chain'd as we are, and wall'd in by our keepers, You have provided, that we shall not fail To answer to your call. Heg. The greatest care Is scarce enough to guard against deceit; And the most cautious, even when he thinks He's most upon his guard, is often trick'd.â But have I not just cause to watch you well, When I have bought you with so large a sum? Phil. 'Twould not be right in us to blame you for it; Nor, should occasion offer to escape, Would it be right in you to censure us, That we made use of it. Heg. As you are here, So in your country is my son confin'd. Phil. What! is your son a captive?â Heg. Yes, he is. Phil. We are not then, it seems, the only cowards. Heg. (To Phil. supposing him Servant to Tynd.) Come nearer this wayâsomething I would know In private of you,âand in which affair You must adhere to truth. Phil. In what I know I'll do it, Sir; and should you ask me ought I do not know, I'll own my ignorance. Tynd. (Aside.) Now is the old man in the barber's shop, Philocrates holds in his hand the razor, Nor has he put a cloth on, to prevent Fouling his cloaths; but whether he's about To shave him close, or trim him through a comb, I know not: if he rightly play his part, He'll take off skin and all. Heg. Which would you chuse? To be a slave, or have your freedom? tell me. Phil. That I prefer, which nearest is to good, And farthest off from evil:âthough, I own, My servitude was little grievous to me;â They treated me the same as their own child. Tynd. (Aside.) Bravo!âI would not give a talent now To purchase even Thales the Milesian;â A very oaf in wisdom match'd with this man.â How cleverly does he adapt his phrase To suit a slave's condition. Heg. Of what family Is this Philocrates? Phil. The Polyplusian,â A potent and most honourable house! Heg. What honours held he in his country? Phil. High ones, Such as the chief men can alone attain to. Heg. Seeing his rank's so noble, as you say, What is his substance? Phil. As to that, the old one Is very warm. Heg. His father's living then? Phil. We left him so, when we departed thence; But whether he is now alive or no, You must ask further of the nether regions. Tynd. (Aside.) Soâall is right,âhe's not content with lying, But reasons like a wise man. Heg. What's his name? Phil. Thesaurochrysonicochrysides. Heg. A name bestowed upon him for his wealth! Phil. Nay, rather for his avarice and extortion.â His real name was Theodoromedes. Heg. How say you?âIs his father covetous? Phil. Very.âTo let you more into his character,â In sacrificing to his houshold Genius He uses nothing but vile Samian vessels, For fear the God should steal them:âmark by this, What trust he puts in others. Heg. Come you this way.â (Aside.) What further information I require, I'll learn from him. (Adressing Tyndarus as Philocrates.) Philocrates, your servant Has acted as behoves an honest fellow.â I've learn'd of him your family:âhe has own'd it:â Do you the same; 'twill turn to your advantage,â If you confess what, be assur'd, I know From him already. Tynd. Sir, he did his duty, When he confess'd the truth to you,âalthough I would have fain conceal'd from you my state, My family, and my means.âBut now alas! Since I have lost my country and my freedom, Can I suppose it right, that he should dread Me before you? The pow'r of war has sunk My fortunes to a level with his own.â Time was, he dar'd not to offend in word, Though now he may in deed.âDo you not mark, How Fortune moulds and fashions human beings, Just as she pleases? Me, who once was free, She has made a slave, from highest thrown me down To lowest state:âAccustom'd to command, I now abide the bidding of another.â Yet if my master bear him with like sway, As when myself did lord it over mine, I have no dread, that his authority Will deal or harshly or unjustly with me.â So far I wish'd you to be made acquainted, If peradventure you dislike it not. Heg. Speak on, and boldly. Tynd. I ere this was free As your own son.âHim has the pow'r of war Depriv'd of liberty, as it has me. He in my country is a slave,âas now I am a slave in this.âThere is indeed A God, that hears and sees whate'er we do:â As you respect me, so will He respect Your lost son.âTo the well-deserving, good Will happen, to the ill-deserving ill.â Think, that my father feels the want of me, As much as you do of your son. Heg. I know it.â But say, will you subscribe to the account Your servant gave? Tynd. My father's rich, I own, My family is noble;âbut, I pray you, Let not the thought of these my riches bend Your mind to sordid avarice, lest my father, Though I'm his only child, should deem it fitter I were your slave, cloath'd, pamper'd at your cost, Than beg my bread in my own country, where It were a foul disgrace. Heg. Thanks to the Gods, And to my ancestors, I'm rich enough.â Nor do I hold, that every kind of gain Is always serviceable.âGain, I know, Has render'd many great.âBut there are times, When loss should be preferr'd to gain.âI hate it, 'Tis my aversion, money:âmany a man Has it enticed oft-times to wrong.âBut now Attend to me, that you may know my mind. My son's a captive and a slave of Ãlis:â If you restore him to me, I require No other recompense;âI'll send you back, You and your servant:âon no other terms Can you go hence. Tynd. You ask what's right and just,â Thou best of men!âBut is your son a servant Or of the public, or some private person? Heg. A privateâof Menarchus a physician. Phil. O 'tis His father's client;âand success Pours down upon you, like an hasty shower. Heg. Find means then to redeem my son. Tynd. I'll find them.â But I must ask youâ Heg. Ask me what you will, I'll do't,âif to that purpose. Tynd. Hear, and judge.â I do not ask you, till your son's return To grant me a dismission; but, I pray you, Give me my slave, a price set on his head, That I may send him forthwith to my father, To work your son's redemption. Heg. I'd dispatch Some other rather, when there is a truce, Your father to confer with, who may bear Any commands you shall entrust him with. Tynd. 'Twould be in vain to send a stranger to him:â You'd lose your labour:âSend my servant:âhe'll Compleat the whole, as soon as he arrives. A man more faithful you can never send, Nor one my father sooner would rely on, More to his mind, nor to whose care and confidence He'd sooner trust your son.âThen never fear: At my own peril will I prove his faith, Relying on his nature, since he knows I've borne me with benevolence towards him. Heg. WellâI'll dispatch him, if you will,âyour word Pawn'd for his valuation. Tynd. Prithee do, And let him be dismiss'd without delay. Heg. Can you shew reason, if he don't return, Why you should not pay twenty MinÃ¦ for him? Tynd. No surely: I agree. Heg. Take off his chains,â And take them off from both. Tynd. May all the Gods Grant all your wishes! since that you have deign'd To treat me with such favour, and releas'd me From my vile bonds:âI scarce can think it irksome To have my neck free from this galling collar. Hrg. The favours we confer on honest souls Teem with returns of service to the giver.â But now, if you'd dispatch him hence, acquaint him, Give him your orders, and forthwith instruct him What you would have him say unto your father.â Shall I then call him to you? Tynd. Do, Sir,âcall him. (Hegio calls Philocrates, who advances.) SCENE III. PHILOCRATES joins HEGIO and TYNDARUS. HEGIO. Heav'ns grant, that this affair may turn out happily To me, and to my son, and to you both!â (To Phil.) 'Tis your new master's order, that you serve Your old one faithfully: I have giv'n you to him, Rated at twenty MinÃ¦: he desires To send you back to Ãlis to his father, Thence to redeem my child, that so there may be Mutual exchange betwixt us of our sons. Phil. I'm of a pliant nature, and will bend To either.âYou may use me like a wheel;â This way or that way will I turn and twirl, As you shall please to order. Heg. It is much To your advantage truly, that you own This easy nature, which enables you To bear your state of slavery as you ought.â Follow me this way.â(To Tynd.) Here now is the man. Tynd. I thank you for the liberty you give me To send this messenger to my relations, That he may tell my father all about me, And how I fare, and what I would have done.â We have agreed betwixt us, Tyndarus, To send you unto Ãlis to my father; And, if that you return not, I have bargain'd To forfeit for your trespass twenty MinÃ¦. Phil. Rightly agreed:âfor the old gentleman Expects me, or some other messenger, To come to him from hence. Tynd. Then mind me now, What I would have you say unto my father. Phil. O master, as I've hitherto behav'd, My best endeavours I'll exert; what most Will turn to your advantage, I'll pursue With all my heart, my soul, with all my power. Tynd. You act, as it behoves you.âNow attend.â First, to my dearest mother and my father Bear my respects, and next to my relations,â Then to whatever other friend you see. Inform them of my health; and tell them likewise, That I am slave here to this best of men, Who ever has, and still goes on to treat me With honourable usage.â Phil. Don't instruct me; This I shall think of readily.â Tynd. For indeed, Save that I have a guard plac'd over me, I should conceive I had my liberty.â Acquaint my father with th'agreement made 'Twixt me and Hegio, touching Hegio's son.â Phil. This is mere hindrance, to recount and dwell on What I already am so well appriz'd of.â Phil. 'Tis to redeem the youth, and send him hither Exchang'd for you and me.â Phil. I shall remember.â Heg. And soon too as he can, for both our sakes. Phil. You long not more to see your son return'd, Than he does his. Heg. My son to me is dear; Dear is his own to every one. Phil. (To Tynd.) Ought else. To bear unto your father? Tynd. Say, I'm well; And tell him, boldly tell him, that our souls Were link'd in perfect harmony together; That nothing you have ever done amiss, Nor have I ever been your enemy; That in our sore affliction you maintain'd Your duty to your master, nor once swerv'd From your fidelity, in no one deed Deserted me in time of my distress. When that my father is inform'd of this, And learns, how well your heart has been inclin'd Both to his son and to himself, he'll never Prove such a niggard, but in gratitude He will reward you with your liberty; And I, if I return, with all my power Will urge him the more readily to do it. For by your aid, your courtesy, your courage, Wisdom and prudence, you have been the means Of my return to Ãlis, since you own'd To Hegio here my family and fortune, By which you've freed your master from his chains. Phil. True, I have acted as you say,âand much It pleases me, you bear it in remembrance. What I have done was due to your deserts: For were I in my count to tell the sum Of all your friendly offices towards me, Night would bear off the day, ere I had done. You was obliging, as obsequious to me, As though you were my servant. Heg. O ye Gods!â Behold the honest nature of these men!â They draw tears from me.âMark, how cordially They love each other! and what praise the servant Heaps on his master! Phil. He deserves from me An hundred times more praise, than he was pleas'd To lavish on me. Heg. (To Phil.) Then, since hitherto You've acted worthily, occasion now Presents itself to add to your good deeds, That you may prove your faithfulness towards him In this affair. Phil. My wish to compass it Cannot exceed th'endeavours I will use To get it perfected.âAnd to convince you, Here do I call high Jove to witness, Hegio, I will not prove unfaithful to Philocrates.â Heg. Thou art an honest fellow.â Phil. Nor will I Act otherwise to Him, than I myself Would act to Me. Tynd. Would you might make your words True by your actions!âBear it in your mind, That I have said less of you than I would, And prithee be not angry with my words. Think, I beseech you, that my honour's staked For your dismission, and my life is here A pledge for your return. When out of sight, As shortly you will be, deny not then All knowledge of me: when you shall have left me Here as a pawn in slavery for you, Yourself at liberty, desert not then Your hostage, then neglect not to procure His son's redemption in exchange for me. Remember, you are sent on this affair, Rated at twenty MinÃ¦. See, that you Be trusty to the trusty:âO beware, You are not of a frail and fickle faith.â My father will, I know, do all he ought: Preserve me then your friend for evermore, And still find Hegio your's, as you have found him. By your right hand, which here I hold in mine, I pray you, be not you less true to me, Than I am unto you.âAbout it then; Be careful of this business;âyou are now My master, you my patron, you my father: To you I do commend my hopes, my all. Phil. If I accomplish all that you command, Will that content you? Tynd. I shall be content. Phil. I will return furnish'd to both your wishes.â Would you ought else? Tynd. Back with what speed you may. Phil. Of that the business of itself reminds me. Heg. (To Phil.) Follow me now.âI'll give you from my Banker What you may want to answer your expences Upon your voyage, at the same time take A passport from the PrÃ¦tor. Tynd. Why a passport? Heg. Which he may carry with him to the army, That he may have permission without let To return home to Ãlis.â(To Tynd.) Go you in. Tynd. Now speed you well, my Tyndarus! Phil. Adieu! Heg. (Aside.) I've compass'd my design by purchasing These captives of the QuÃ¦stors from the spoil:â So please the Gods! I've free'd my son from bondage.â Within, hoa!âKeep a strict watch o'er this captive: Let him not budge a foot without a guard.â I soon shall be at home.âNow to my brother's: I'll go and visit there my other captives, At the same time enquire, if any know This youth here.â(To Phil.) Do you follow, that I may Dispatch you strait;âfor that's my first concern. [Hegio goes off with Philocrates, and Tyndarus goes in with the Slaves, The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter ERGASILUS. It's a sad case for a poor wretch to prowl In quest of a meal's meat, and at the last With much ado to find one;âsadder is it, With much ado to hunt upon the trail, And at the last find nothing; but most sad, To have a keen and craving appetite, Without a morsel to appease it's longing.â A plague upon this day!âI'd dig it's eyes out, Had I the pow'r, it has so fill'd mankind With enmity towards me.âNever sure Was there a wretch so starv'd, so cram'd with hunger, Or one, whose projects have so little prosper'd.â I fear, my belly will keep holy-day. Would it were hang'd for me, this scurvy trade, This Parasite's profession!âOur young sparks Consort not now a-days with us poor drolls; They care not for us humble hangers-on, Who are content to take the lowest seat At table, who bear buffers like a Spartan, And have no other fortune but our jests.â Their choice is to associate with their equals, Who, having ate with them, return the favour At their own houses.âFor themselves they cater, Which was the province heretofore of Parasites.â Shame on them! they will go into a brothel Barefaced, nor muffled up, but all as publickly As magistrates pass sentence on the guilty, Unveil'd, in open court.âBuffoons they now Count nothing worth; but they are all self-lovers. For when I went from hence a while ago; I met some of these young men at the Forum. Good day, said I!âWhere shall we dine together? No answer.âWhat! will no one speak? says I, None promise me a dinner?âSilent all, As they were dumb.âNay, not a single smile. Where shall we sup then?âStill no invitation. One of my best jests, such as heretofore Have got me suppers for a month, I then Repeat them.âNot a soul vouchsafed to smile. I then found out, 'twas a concerted matter: Not one would deign to imitate a dog, When he's provok'd:âBut if they did not chuse To laugh outright, at least they might have shewn Their teeth, as though they smiled.âFinding myself The scoff and mockery of these sparks, I leave them, March up to others, others still, and others; All the same thing! all in confederacy, Like the oil merchants in the market.âWell then, Seeing myself thus fool'd, I came back hither.â More parasites were sauntering at the Forum, And to as little purpose as my self.â I am determin'd, that the law shall right me Against all those, who join in combination To have me starv'd.âI will appoint a day For them to give their answer.âI will have Large satisfaction.âDear as are provisions, They shall be fined at least ten entertainments.â Now to the port, where I have yet one hope Of feasting:âif that fail me, I'll return To this old Hegio, and his scurvy supper. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter HEGIO, with ARISTOPHONTES behind. What can be more delightful than promoting The public good, as yesterday I did By purchasing these captives? Ev'ry one, Soon as he sees me, strait makes up to me, Congratulates me on it:âthey have tired me Quite out, by stopping and detaining me:â Scarce have I 'scaped alive from their civilities, At length I got me to the PrÃ¦tor;âthere Scarce rested me:âI ask'd a pass-port of him: 'Twas granted; and I gave it strait to Tyndarus, Who is set off:âfrom thence I hurried home: Then to my brother's, to my other captives. I ask'd, if any one among them knew Philocrates of Ãlis, when this man Cried out, he was his friend and intimate. On telling him he now was at my house, He beg'd me, I would give him leave to see him: On which I order'd off his chains that instant.â (To Arist.) Follow me now, that you may have your wish, And meet the person you desire to see. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Enter TYNDARUS. Would I were dead now rather than alive, As things turn out!âHope has deserted me, No succour will come near me.âSee the day, In which there is no chance to save my life! Destruction's unavoidable,âno hope, That can dispel my fear,âno cloak to screen My subtle lies, false dealings, and pretences: No deprecation can excuse my perfidy, No subterfuge can palliate my offence: No room for confidence, no place for cunning.â What hitherto was hid is brought to light, My tricks laid open, and the whole discover'd: Nor have I ought to do but meet my fate, And dye at once for me and for my master.â Aristophontes, who is just gone in, Has been my utter ruin; for he knows me: He is a friend and kinsman to Philocrates. Salvation could not save me, if she would: Nor can I 'scape,âexcept that I contrive Some cunning trick, some artifice. (meditating.) A plague on't! What can I think of?âwhat devise?âmy thoughts Are foolish, and my wit quite at a stand. (Retires aside. SCENE IV. Enter HEGIO, ARISTOPHONTES, and Slaves. HEGIO. Where can he now have stole him out of doors? Tynd. (Aside.) 'Tis over with me!âTyndarus, your foes Are making their advances strait towards you.â What shall I say? what talk off? what deny, Or what confess?â'Tis all uncertainty; Nor know I what to think of or confide in.â Would that the Gods had utterly destroy'd you, Aristophontes, ere you lost your country, To disconcert a scheme so well contrived. Our state is desperate, if I don't devise Some cunning trick, Heg. (To Arist.) Follow me.âHere he is:â Approach, and speak to him. Tynd. (Aside, and turning away.) Can there exist A greater wretch than I am? Arist. Why is this, That you avoid my eyes, and slight me, Tyndarus, As though I were a stranger, and you ne'er Had known me.âIt is true, I am a slave As you are:âthough in Ãlis I was free; You from your youth have ever been a slave. Heg. In troth I am not in the least amazed, That he should shun you, and avoid your sight, Or hold you in despite and detestation, When for Philocrates you call him Tyndarus. Tynd. Hegio, this fellow was at Ãlis deem'd A madman:âgive no ear to what he says. 'Tis there notorious, that he sought to kill His father and his mother, and has often Fits of the falling sickness come upon him, Which makes him foam at mouth.âPray get you from him. Heg. Hereâbear him further off. (To the Slaves.) Arist. How say you, rascal! That I am mad? and that I sought to kill My father and my mother? and have often Fits of the falling sickness come upon me, Which makes me foam at mouth? Heg. Be not dismay'd. Many have labour'd under this disease, And spitting has restor'd them to their health. Tynd. I know, to some at Ãlis it has prov'd Of special use. Arist. And will you credit him? Heg. I credit him!âin what? Arist. That I am mad. Tynd. See how he eyes you with a furious aspect!â 'Twere best retire.â'Tis, Hegio, as I said:â His frenzy grows upon him,âhave a care. Heg. True,âwhen he call'd you Tyndarus, I thought, That he indeed was mad. Tynd. Nay, but sometimes He knows not his own name, nor who he is. Heg. He said, you was his friend. Tynd. I never saw him. AlcmÃ¦on, and Orestes, and Lycurgus, Are just as much my friends, as he is, Hegio. Arist. How, rascal!âdo you dare bespeak me ill? Do I not know you? Heg. By my troth 'tis plain You know him not, when for Philocrates You call him Tyndarus:âyou are a stranger To him you see, and name him whom you see not. Arist. 'Tis he pretends himself the man he is not, Denies himself to be the man he is. Tynd. O to be sure, you'll get the better of me In reputation for veracity! Arist. You, as it seems, my truth will overpower With falsehood.âPrithee look me in the face. Tynd. Well. Arist. Speak.âDo you deny, that you are Tyndarus? Tynd. I tell you, I deny it. Arist. Will you say, You are Philocrates? Tynd. I say, I am. Arist. (To Phil.) And you,âdo you believe him? Heg. More than you, Or than myself.âThe man, you say he is, Set out this day for Ãlis to His father. Arist. What Father?âHe's a slave.â Tynd. And so are you, Once free as I was,âas I trust I shall be, When I have gain'd this old man's son his liberty. Arist. How rascal! will you dare to call you free man? Tynd. Not Freeman, but I say, I am Philocrates. Arist. See, Hegio, how the rogue makes sport with you! For he's a slave, and never own'd a slave Besides himself. Tynd. So then,âbecause you liv'd A beggar in your country without means For your support, you would have ev'ry one Plac'd on the self same footing with yourself.â No wonder:â'tis the nature of the poor To hate and envy men of property. Arist. Have a care, Hegio, how you rashly credit him. As far as I can see, he means to trick you:â Nor do I like at all his talking to you Of the redemption of your son. Tynd. I know, You wish it not: but with the help of heav'n I shall accomplish it:âI shall restore His son to him, and he will send me back To Ãlis to my father; for which purpose Have I sent Tyndarus. Arist. Why You are He; Nor is there any other slave at Ãlis Of that name but yourself. Tynd. And will you still Reproach me with my state of servitude, Brought on me by the chance of hapless war? Arist. I can't contain myself. Tynd. Ha! do you hear him?â Will you not fly?âHe'll pelt us now with stones, Unless you have him seiz'd. Arist. I'm vext to death. Tynd. Look, how his eyes strike fire!âA cord, a cord, Good Hegio. Don't you see his body's charged With livid spots all over?âThe black bile Disorders him, poor fellow! Arist. The black pitch Disorder you beneath the hangman's hand, And (if this old man would but serve you right,) Illuminate your head! Tynd. How wild he talks! He is possess'd by evil spirits. Heg. Suppose I order him to be seiz'd. Tynd. 'Twere the best way. Arist. It vexes me I cannot find a stone To dash the villain's brains out, who insists That I am mad. Tynd. Thereâdo you hear him, Sir? He's looking for a stone. Arist. Shall I beg, Hegio, A word with you alone? Heg. Speak where you are,â What would you?âI can hear you at a distance. Tynd. If you permit him to approach you nearer, He'll bite your nose off. Arist. Hegio, do not you Believe that I am mad, or ever was; Nor have I the disorder he pretends. If any outrage you do fear from me, Command me to be bound: 'tis my desire, So at the same time he be bound with me. Tynd. Let him be bound, that chuses it. Arist. No more:â I warrant I shall make you, false Philocrates, To be found out the real Tyndarus.â Why do you nod at me? Tynd. I nod at you? (To Hegio) What would he do, if you were further off? Heg. How say you? What if I approach this madman? Tynd. He'll teaze you with his fooleries, and jabber Stuff without head or tail.âHe only wants The habit, else he is a perfect Ajax. Heg. No matterâI'll go to him. (advances to Arist. Tynd. I'm undone.â Now do I stand between the stone and victim, Nor know I what to do. Heg. Aristophontes, , If you would ought with me, I lend attention. Arist. Sir, you shall hear the real truth from me, Which now you deem a falshood.âBut I first Would clear me to you from this charge of madness.â Believe me, Hegio, I'm not mad, nor have I Any complaint but this,âthat I'm a slave.â O never may the king of gods and men My native country suffer me to see, If This is any more Philocrates Than you or I. Heg. Tell me, who is he then? Arist. The same, I said he was from the beginning. If you shall find it other, I can shew No cause, no reason, why I should not suffer A lack of liberty, your slave for ever. Heg. (to Tynd.) And what do you say? Tynd. That I am your slave, And you my master. Heg. I don't ask you that.â Was you a free man? Tynd. Yes, I was. Arist. Indeed He never was: he trifles with you, Hegio. Tynd. How do you know? or was you peradventure My mother's midwife, that you dare affirm What you advance with so much confidence? Arist. A boy I saw you when a boy. Tynd. A man I see you now a man.âSoâthere's an answer.â If your behaviour was as would become you, You would not interfere in my concerns.â Do I in yours? Heg. (to Arist.) Say, was his father's name Thesaurochrysonicochrysides? Arist. 'Twas not,ânor did I ever hear the name Before to-day:âPhilocrates's father Was call'd Theodoromedes. Tynd. I'm ruin'd! Be still my heart!âprithee go hang yourselfâ Still, still will you be throbbing.âWoe is me! I scarce can stand upon my legs for fear. Heg. Can I be sure this fellow was a slave In Ãlis, and is not Philocrates? Arist. So certain, that you'll never find it other. But where is He now? Heg. Where I least could wish him, And where he wishes most himself to be. Ah me! I am disjointed, sawn asunder, By the intrigues of this vile rascal, who Has led me by the nose just at his pleasure.â But have a care you err not. Arist. What I say, Is as a thing assur'd, a truth establish'd. Heg. And is it certain? Arist. Yes,âso very certain, That you can never find a thing that's more so. I and Philocrates have been friends from boys. Heg. What sort of person was Philocrates? Arist. His hair inclin'd to red, frizzled and curl'd, A lenten jaw, sharp nose, a fair complexion, And black eyes.â Heg. The description's very like him. Tynd. Now by my troth it was a sore mischance, My coming here:âwoe to the hapless twigs, Will die upon my back: Heg. I plainly see, I have been cheated. Tynd. Why do ye delay? Haste, haste, ye chains, come and embrace my legs, That I may have you in my custody.â Heg. These villainous captives, how they have deceiv'd me! He, that is gone off, feign'd himself a slave, And this a free man.âI have lost the kernel, And for security the shell is left me.â Fool that I am! they have impos'd upon me In ev'ry shape.âBut he shall never more Make me his sport.âHoa, Colapho, Cordalio, Corax, go in and bring me out the thongs. Slave. What, is he sending us to bind up faggots? [The Slaves go in, and return with thongs. SCENE V. HEGIO, ARISTOPHONTES, and Slaves. HEGIO. This instant manacle that rascal there. [to his Slaves. Tynd. Ah! why is this? in what have I offended? Heg. What, do you ask? you that have been the sower, The weeder, and the reaper of these villainies.â Tynd. Why, first of all, did you not call me harrower? Husbandmen always harrow first the ground, Before they weed it.â Heg. See, with what assurance He stands before me! Tynd. It becomes a slave, That's innocent, unconscious of a crime, To bear him with such confidence, especially Before his master.â Heg. See you bind his hands, And hard too. Tynd. I am yours, my hands are yours;â If 'tis your pleasure, bid them be cut off.â But what's the matter?âwhy thus angry with me? Heg. Because that by your knavish lying schemes You have destroy'd, as far as in your power, Me and my hopes, distracted my affairs, And by your tricks have chous'd me of Philocrates. I thought he was a slave, and you a free man, For so you said you were, and for that purpose You chang'd your names. Tynd. I own that I have acted E'en as you say,âthat he has found the means For his escaping, and through my assistance.â Is it for this then you are angry with me? Heg. What you have done, you'll find will cost you dear. Tynd. Death I esteem a trifle, when not merited By evil actions.âIf I perish here, And he return not, as he gave his word, This act will be remembred to my honour, After I'm dead;âthat I contriv'd to free My master,when a captive, from his state Of slavery and oppression with the foe; Restor'd him to his country and his father, Preferring rather to expose my life To danger for him, than that he should suffer. Heg. Enjoy that fame then in the other world. Tynd. He dies to live, who dies in Virtue's cause. Heg. When I have put you to severest torture, And for your tricks have ta'en away your life, Let them extol you, that you are no more, Let them extol you, that you've lost your life, Nay, let them say, that you are still alive, It matters not to me, so you but die. Tynd. Do,âput your threats in force,âyou'll suffer for it, If he return here, as I trust he will. Arist. (Aside) O ye immortal gods!âI know it now, I understand it all.âMy friend Philocrates Enjoys his liberty, is with his father At large in his own country.âThat is well.â There's not a man, whom I wish better to.â But O! it grieves me, I have done for Him So ill an office, who alas! is chain'd On my account for what I hap'd to say. Heg. Did I not charge you not to tell me false? Tynd. You did. Heg. Then wherefore have you dar'd to do it? Tynd. Truth would have done him hurt I wish'd to serve: Falsehood has done him good. Heg. But hurt to you. Tynd. 'Tis best.âI've serv'd my master, and I joy in't:â My good old master gave him to my care.â And do you think this wrongly done in me? Heg. Most wrongly. Tynd. I, who can't but differ from you, Say rightly.âOnly think,âif any slave Of your's had done the same thing for your son, How, how would you have thank'd him!âwould you not Have giv'n him freedom? would you not have held him In your esteem high above all his fellows?â I prithee answer me. Heg. I think I should. Tynd. Why are you angry then with me? Heg. Because You were to him more faithful than to me. Tynd. What! could you have expected, that a man, Newly a captive, and just made your slave, Should in one night and day be taught by you More to consult your interest than the good Of one, whom he had liv'd with from a boy? Heg. Seek your reward then of that one.â (To the Slaves.) Go bear him, Where he may put on large and ponderous chains.â To the stone-quarries after shalt thou go: There, in the time that others dig out eight, If ev'ry day thou dost not dig twelve stones, Thou shalt be dubb'd with stripes Sexcentoplagus. Arist. By Gods and men I do conjure you, Hegio, O let him not be lost. Heg. I'll look to that. At night he shall be guarded, bound with thongs, And in the day shall labour in the quarries. I'll keep him in continual exercise, Nor shall he know the respite of one day. Arist. Is that your resolution? Heg. Sure as death.â Bear him directly to Hippolytus The smith, and bid him clap upon his legs Huge massy irons; then without the gate Go, carry him to Cordalus my freed-man, That he may make him labour in the quarries; And tell him, 'tis my pleasure he be used No better than the vilest slave I have. Tynd. Against your will why should I wish to live? My loss of life will be a loss to you. There is no evil I need dread in death, When death is over. Were I to survive To th'utmost age of man, my space of time To bear the hardships, which you threat me with, Would yet be short.âThen fare you well,âbe happy,â Though you deserve another language from me. And you, Aristophontes, take from me As good a farewell, as you've merited: For you have been the cause of this. Heg. Hence with him. Tynd. One thing I yet request,âthat, if Philocrates Come back again, I may have leave to see him. Heg. Bear him this instant from my sight, ye slaves, Or you yourselves shall suffer. (The Slaves lay hold on Tyndarus, and push him along. Tynd. This indeed Is downright violence,âto be drag'd and driven. [He is born off by the Slaves. SCENE VI. Enter HEGIO and ARISTOPHONTES. HEGIO. Soâhe is carried off to limbo.âWell,â I'll teach my other captives, how to dare Attempt another such-like enterprise! Had it not been for Him, who made discovery Of this device, they all with knavish arts Had led me by the bridle.âI'm resolv'd Henceforth I will have faith in none of them.â I have been once impos'd on full enough.â Ah me! I hop'd to have redeem'd my son From slavery.âThat hope is vanish'd quite!â One son I lost at four years old;âa slave Then stole him from me; nor have I once heard From that time of the slave or of my son.â My eldest is a captive with the foe.â Ha! how is this? as though I had begot My children only to be childless.âFollow me; (to Arist. And I'll conduct you to your former station. I am resolv'd, to no one will I shew Pity henceforth,âsince no one pities me. Arist. With an ill omen freed from chains I came, With an ill omen I to chains return. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter ERGASILUS at a distance. O Jove supreme! how has thy providence Preserv'd me! how hast thou increas'd my means, And thrown most ample plenty in my way! What store of honours and emolument, Celebrity, sport, pastime, holidays, With ev'ry choice provision for good cheer, Potations deep, and feastings in abundance, Till the gorg'd appetite shall cry, Enough!â Tis fix'd, in future I will cringe and crouch To no man, I: for now I am possess'd Of means to help a friend, or hurt an enemy. O this delightful day has heap'd upon me Delights the most delightful:âI am master Of an inheritance without incumbrance.â Now will I shape my course to Hegio here, And bring him as much happiness, as himself Could wish for from the Gods, and even more. WellâI will throw my cloak then o'er my shoulder, Like slaves in comedies, for expedition, That I may be the first to tell it him: And for my tidings I have hopes to get Good eating with him to eternity. SCENE II. Enter HEGIO. The more I think on this affair, the more Is my uneasiness of mind increas'd.â That they should gull me in this sort!âand I Never perceive it!âWhen this once is known, I shall be made the jest of the whole town; And soon as e'er I come into the Forum, âThat's the old fellow there,â they all will cry, âWho has been trick'd.ââBut is not this Ergasilus, I see at distance?âSure it is,âhis cloak Thrown o'er his shoulder.âWhat is he about? Erg. (Advancing.) Haste, haste, Ergasilus,âlook to thy business.â (Loud.) Hence,âhave a care,âI warn you, and forewarn you,â Let no man stop me in my way, unless He thinks that he has had enough of life;â Whoever stops me, he shall kiss the ground. Heg. He puts himself in posture as for boxing.â Erg. I'll do't,âby heav'ns I'll do't.âLet ev'ry one Pursue his own track, nor by any business Clog up the street.âMy fist is a Balista, My arm a Catapulta, and my shoulder A Battering-Ram.âOn whomsoever once I dart my knee, I'll give him to the ground.â Whatever mortal I shall light upon, I'll knock his teeth out, and employ the wretch To pick them up again. Heg. What mighty menaces! They quite astonish me. Erg. If any dare Oppose my course, I'll make him to remember The day, the place for evermore, and me: Who stops me, puts a stop to his existence. Heg. What would the man be at with all his swaggering? Erg. I give you notice, caution you before-hand, That it may be your own fault, if you're caught.â Keep home then, guard you from assault. Heg. 'Twere strange this, Had not his belly got him this assurance. I pity the poor wretch, whose cheer has swol'n him To all this insolence. Erg. Then for your bakers, Breeders of swine, rascals who feed their hogs With refuse bran, that no one can pass by Their bake-house for the stench;âlet me but see One of their swine here in the public way, My fists shall give the owner such a dusting, As shall beat out his bran about his ears. Heg. He issues royal and imperial edicts! His belly's full: his belly gives him impudence. Erg. Then for your fishmongers, who hawk about Upon a four-leg'd dull provoking jade Their stale commodities, whose very stench Drives off our saunterers in the Forum;âtroth, I'll beat their filthy baskets 'bout their chaps, That they may know how much offence they give To others' noses.âThen too for the butchers, Who under the pretence of selling lamb Will put off ewe upon you, fob you off With ram for weather mutton;âin my way If I should chance to meet a ram of theirs, Woe to the ram, and woe too to it's owner! Heg. Heyday! this swaggering fellow issues out His edicts and commands, as though he were Comptroller of the Victualling:âOur Ãtolians Have made him, sure, Inspector of the Market. Erg. No more a parasite, but I'm a king,â More kingly than a king,âa king of kings; In port I have it, such an ample store! Provision for the belly.âWhy do I Delay to load old Hegio here with transport, Who is in troth the happiest man alive. Heg. What transport is it, that himself, it seems, Is in a transport to impart to me? Erg. (Knocking at Hegio's door) Hoa thereâwhere are ye? some one, ope the door. Heg. He's come to sup with me. Erg. Ope both the doors, Ere piece-meal I demolish them with knocking. Heg. I have a mind to speak to him.âErgasilus! Erg. Who calls Ergasilus? Heg. Turn your headâLook on me. Erg. Look on you?âThat's what Fortune never does, Nor ever will.âWho is it? Heg. Look.âI'm Hegio. Erg. (Turning.) Best of best men, most opportunely met. Heg. You have got some one at the port to sup with, And therefore do you treat me with this scorn. Erg. Give me thy hand. Heg. My hand? Erg. Thy hand, I say. Give it this instant. Heg. There it is. (Giving his hand.) Erg. Be joyous. Heg. Joyous! for what? Erg. Because it is my order.â Come, come, be joyous. Heg. Joy alas! with me By sorrow is prevented. Erg. Do not grieve: I'll wipe away this instant ev'ry stain Of sorrow from your soul.âPluck up,âbe joyous. Heg. Well,âthough I know no reason to rejoice. Erg. That's bravely done.âNow orderâ Heg. Order what? Erg. A monstruous fire. Heg. A monstruous fire? Erg. I say it: An huge one let it be. Heg. Why how now, Vulture? Think you, that I will fire my house to please you? Erg. Nay, prithee don't be angry.âWill you order, Or will you not, the pots to be put on? The dishes to be wash'd? the larded meats, And kickshaws to be set upon the stoves? Won't you send some one to buy fish? Heg. He dreams With his eyes open! Erg. Bid another go For pork, lamb, pullets? Heg. Yes, you understand Good living, had you wherewithal to get it. Erg. For hams, for turbot, salmon, mackerel, cod, A fat cheese? Heg. Easier 'tis for you to talk Of all those dainties, than with me to eat them. Erg. Think you, I speak this on my own account? Heg. You will have nothing, don't deceive yourself, Like what you talk off.âPrithee bring with you A stomach suited to such common fare, As you may meet with ev'ry day,âno nice one. Erg. But let me tell you, I shall be the author Of your providing a most sumptuous treat, E'en though I should forbid it. Heg. I? Erg. Yes, you. Heg. Hey! your are then my master. Erg. I'm your friend.â Say, shall I make thee happy? Heg. Certainly I'd rather so, than you should make me wretched. Erg. Give me thy hand. Heg. There,âthere's my hand. Erg. The Gods, The Gods are all your friends. Heg. I feel it not. Erg. You are not in a thorn-bush, else you'd feel.â But let your sacred vessels be prepar'd, And bid them bring forthwith a fatted lamb. Heg. For what? Erg. To make a sacrifice. Heg. To whom? Which of the Gods? Erg. To Me.âFor I am now Thy Jupiter supreme,âI thy Salvation, Thy Life, thy Fortune, thy Delight, thy Joy.â To make this God propitious, cram him well. Heg. May Jupiter and all the Gods confound you. Erg. Nay, you should rather thank me for the news I bring you from the Port, such gladsome news.â Your supper likes me now. Heg. Be gone, you fool,â You're come too late. Erg. Your words had been more true, Had I come sooner.âNow receive from me The transport that I bring you.âAt the Port Just now I saw your son, your Philopolemus, Alive and hearty,âin the pacquet-boat I saw him,âwith him too that other spark, Your captive, he of Ãlis,âand besides, Your slave Stalagmus, he that run away, And stole your little boy at four years old. Heg. Away,âyou joke me. Erg. Holy Gluttony So help me,âas I wish for evermore By her high title to be dignified,â I sawâ Heg. My son? Erg. Your son, my Genius. Heg. With him The captive youth of Ãlis? Erg. By Apollo. Heg. Stalagmus too, who stole my childâ Erg. By Sora. Heg. Long ago,â Erg. By PrÃ¦neste. Heg. Come? Erg. By Signia. Heg. Art sure? Erg. By Phrysinone. Heg. Have a care, You do not tell a falshood. Erg. By Alatrium. Heg. Why do you swear thus by these barbarous cities With uncouth names? Erg. Because they are as hard As is the supper which, you said, you'd give me. Heg. A plague confound you! Erg. Why? because you won't Believe me, though I speak in sober sadness.â But of what country was Stalagmus, when He ran away? Heg. Of Sicily. Erg. But now He's no Sicilian: he is a Slave-onian, To a Slave-onian yoke-mate tied for life. A fit match for him to keep up the family. Heg. And may I then rely on what you've said? Erg. You may rely. Heg. O ye immortal Gods! If he speak truth, I shall seem born again. Erg. And can you doubt me, when I swore so solemnly? If you have little faith then in my oaths, Go to the port yourself. Heg. And so I will.â Take thou the necessary care within: Use, and demand, broach any cask you like, I make you cellar-man. Erg. And if you find me Not a true prophet, curry me with your cudgel. Heg. If your intelligence should turn out true, I will insure you everlasting eating. Erg. From whence? Heg. From me and from my son. Erg. You promise? Heg. I do. Erg. And I too, that your son is come. Heg. You'll manage for the best. Erg. All good attend you. [Exit Hegio. SCENE III. ERGASILUS alone. He's gone,âand has intrusted to my care The high and grand concern of catering.â Immortal Gods! how I shall cut and quarter! How I shall chop the crags from off the chines! What devastation will befal the hams! What a consumption rage among the bacon! What massacre of fat sows paps! of brawn What havock will arise!âThen what fatigue Awaits the butchers! what the hog-killers!â But to say more of what concerns good eating, Is loss of time, and hindrance.âI will now Go enter on my government, and sit In judgment o'er the bacon,âset at liberty Hams that have hung untry'd and uncondemn'd.

May Jove and all the Gods, Ergasilus, Confound thee and thy belly, with all Parasites, And all who shall hereafter entertain them! Storm, tempest, devastation, have just broke Their way into our house!âI was afraid, He would have seiz'd me, like an hungry wolf: I was indeed in a most piteous fright, He made such horrid grinding with his teeth.â Soon as he came, he knock'd down the whole larder With all the meat in't:âthen he snatch'd a knife, And stuck three pigs directly in the throat;â Broke all the pots and cups that were not measure, And ask'd the cook, whether the salting-pans With their contents might not be clap'd upon The fire together all at once:âHe has broke The cellar door down, laid the store-room open.â Secure him, I beseech you, fellow-servants:â I'll to my master, tell him he must order Some more provisions, if he means to have Any himself:âfor, as this fellow manages, There's nothing left, or nothing will be shortly.

O my dear boy!âTo Jove and to the Gods, In duty bound, I pay my utmost thanks;â That they have thus restor'd you to your father;â That they have freed me from the load of sorrow I've labour'd under, since depriv'd of you;â That I behold yon villain in my pow'r;â (Pointing to Stalagmus) And that this youth has kept his word with me. (Pointing to Philocrates) No more,âenough already I've experienc'd Of heart-felt anguish,âwith disquietude And tears enough have worn me,âI have heard Enough too of your troubles, which, my son, You told me at the Port.âThen now to business. Phil. Well, Sir,âwhat recompence may I expect For keeping of my word, and bringing back Your son in liberty? Heg. You've done, Philocrates, What I can never thank you for enough,â So much you merit from my son and me. Philop. Nay, but you can, my father, and you shall, And I shall too:âthe Gods too will enable you Amply to pay a kindness back to one, Who has deserv'd so highly of us both.â Indeed, my father, but you must. Heg. No more,â (To Phil.) I've no tongue to deny whate'er you ask. Phil. I ask of you that slave I left behind An hostage for me, (one, who ever has Prefer'd my interest to his own,) that so I may reward him for his services. Heg. Your services I'll thankfully repay.â That which you ask, and that and any thing Which you require, you may at once command.â Don't be offended, that your slave has felt The marks of my displeasure. Phil. How displeasure? Heg. Finding myself impos'd upon, in chains I had him laid, and sent him to the quarries. Phil. Ah me! it grieves me, that this best of fellows Should undergo these hardships for my sake. Heg. I will have nothing therefore for his ransom:â Freed, without cost, so take him. Phil. Kindly done. But let him, pray, be sent for strait. Heg. He shall. (To attendants) Where are you?âGo, bring Tyndarus here directly.â Do you go in.â(To Phil. and Philop.)

You see at once Your situation:âif you speak the truth, You'll better your bad fortune:âspeak it then,â Be true and just, though you was never so In all your life before. Stal. And do you think I blush to own it, when yourself affirm it? Heg. But I shall make you blush;ânay, I will make you Redden all over. Stal. So!âyou threaten me As though I were not used to stripes.âAway thenâ Say, what's your pleasure?â'Tis but ask, and have. Heg. Fine talking this!âTo cut the matter short, Prithee be brief. Stal. I'll do as you command. Heg. O he was ever an obedient lad!â But to the business.âNow attend, and answer me To what I ask you:âif you speak the truth, You'll better your condition. Stal. That's a joke!â Can you imagine, that I do not know What I deserve? Heg. But yet you may avoid A part, if not the whole. Stal. A trifling part:â Much is my due;âbecause I ran away, And stole your son, then sold him. Heg. Sold! to whom? Stal. Theodoromedes the Polyplusian Of Ãlis, for six MinÃ¦. Heg. O ye Gods!

Or you or I do.â Your father gave you, when a child, a slave Of four years old for your own use and service. Phil. What was his name?âIf what you say is true, Tell me his name. Stal. His name was PÃ¦gnium But afterwards you call'd him Tyndarus. Phil. How came I not to recollect you? Stal. 'Tis The usual way with folks not to remember Or know the man, whose favour is worth nothing. Phil. Tell me,âthat slave, you sold unto my father, And giv'n to me for my own service, was he This old man's son? Heg. Lives he? Stal. I had the money, I car'd for nothing more. Heg. What says Philocrates? Phil. That he, this very Tyndarus, is your son, The proofs shew.âHe was brought up from a boy With me a boy in modesty and virtue Even to manhood. Heg. If ye speak the truth, I am indeed both happy and unhappy. I am unhappy, if he is my son, That I have us'd severity towards him. Ah me! I've treated him with less affection, And with more cruelty than it behoved me. It grieves me, I have wrought him so much harm:â Would it had ne'er been done!âBut see, he comes, Accoutred little suiting to his virtues. SCENE V. Enter TYNDARUS. I've often seen the torments of the damn'd In pictures represented: but no Hell Can equal that, where I was, in the Quarries. That is a place, where ev'ry limb with toil And labour must be wearied.âSoon as I Arriv'd there,âas your brats of quality Have daws, or ducks, or quails to play with,âme They gave, t'amuse myself withal, a Crow.â But see, my master's here before his door! My other master too, return'd from Ãlis! Heg. Save you, my wish'd for son! Tynd. Ha! what?âyour son! Yes, yes, I understand you, why you call Yourself my father, me your son:âyou've done, As parents do,âcaus'd me to see the light. Phil. Save you, sweet Tyndarus! Tynd. And you too,âthough On your account I undergo this trouble. Phil. But through my means you'll now arrive at wealth And liberty.âThis is your father,â(pointing to Hegio.) This (pointing to Stalagmus,) The slave, that stole you hence at four years old, And sold you to my father for six MinÃ¦, Who gave you to me, then a little boy Like to yourself, for my own use and service. He has confess'd the whole: we've brought him back From Ãlis hither. Tynd. Where is Hegio's son? Phil. Your brother,âhe's within. Tynd. How say you? have you Then brought him home? Phil. I tell you, he's within. Tynd. 'Twas rightly done in you. Phil. This is your father, And that the thief, who stole you when a boy. Tynd. And for that theft, now I'm a man as he is, I'll give him to the hangman. Phil. He's deserving.â Tynd. And I'll reward him equal to his merits.â (To Hegio.) But tell me, pray,âare you indeed my father? Heg. I am, my son. Tynd. At length I recollect, And have a dark remembrance, that I've heard My father's name was Hegio. Heg. I am he. Phil. O let your son be lighten'd of those chains, And that slave loaded with them. Heg. 'Tis my purpose; I'll do it the first thing.âThen let us in, And strait send for the smith to take the chains From off my son, and give them to that rascal. Stal. 'Tis right to give them me, for I have nothing. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A COMEDIAN addresses the Spectators. Gallants, this play is founded on chaste manners; No wenching, no intrigues, no child expos'd, No close old dotard cheated of his money, No youth in love, making his mistress free Without his father's knowledge or consent. Few of these sort of Plays our Poets find, T'improve our morals, and make good men better. Now if the piece has pleas'd you, with our acting If you're content, and we have not incur'd Displeasure by it, give us then this token: All who are willing, that reward should wait On chaste and virtuous manners, give applause. The End of The Captives.</field>
