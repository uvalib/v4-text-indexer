      <field name="fulltext">Like the race of leaves The race of man is:â The wind in autumn strows The earth with old leaves: then the spring the woods with new endows. Homer, Il. vi. 147. Rendered by Chapman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaves! little leaves!âthy children, thy flatterers, thine enemies! Leaves in the wind, those who would devote thee to darkness, who scorn or miscall thee here, even as they also whose great fame shall outlast them. For all these, and the like of them, are born indeed in the spring seasonâ????? ??????????? ???âand soon a wind hath scattered them, and thereafter the wood peopleth itself again with another generation of leaves. Marcus Aurelius. Rendered by Walter Pater.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SUNSET: A GARDEN of the Regia, full of almonds, peaches &amp; judas-trees in flower. A fountain is playing; statues of Apollo &amp; of Faustina are seen among the leaves. Afar, the noise of the games drawing to a close, is heard from the amphitheatre. Enter Fadilla &amp; Lucilla. FADILLA. How BLUE A NIGHT TO HOLD THESE BLOSSOMS. SPRING AS FULL OF SUMMER AS IF DREAMS WERE REAL! Why are you here, Lucilla? LUCILLA. Can you ask? You too have watched with worshipping, faintheart The love-star dawn on sunset, you have tasted The breath of coverts. FADILLA. Ah, how many times! But now I do not court my happiness Among the gem-like petals full of bloom, And rich with twilight; no, my love requires The fortunes of the world to be as branches Platted for Eros' hiding-place; my lovers Are generals or statesmen; and for pastime I need the zest of politics. LUCILLA. I too. FADILLA. No, no, unsay it. You must reach my age, My forty years, before you own the right To leave all bosom-loves for this hard joy That the head takes in loving. Little sister, You have our mother's childlike agelessness, You are Faustina, save that you can frown; And owe it to your face to live as she For candid passion, impulse of an hour. You who have been the wife of Lucius Verus, Co-empress with your mother in her pride, Though now the mere wife of a senator, You have your honours still. Why should you strive? Meddle no further with the dangerous world Where Eros knits his brow, a politician, And changes dart for axe. LUCILLA. Then you suspect . . . ? FADILLA. Whom, what? Why are you restless? Turn your head! It holds a plot. LUCILLA. To spring on such a one When he is blind with heavenly cloud of flowers. But in your politics, Fadilla, say, Why do you favour Commodus? FADILLA. I love My brother; he and you and I are all The children of FaustinaâI alone Have something of my father, and can pity The lot that made us his. He forced our brother To obstinate recoil. Philosophy, That smiles on life, till life is made ashamed, And sunders from each end for which it throbs, Praise, glory, pleasure, how should it direct Youth through its awful rapine? By the gods Marcus is held as good and our fair mother As evil . . . yet our father poisoned life In each of us from childhood, for his voice Withered illusion, and our urgent youth To him was nothingness, to us a lie That could not prove the truth it made us feel. He spoke of us as leaves within a wind, Leaves shaken diversely: and so we are, Unhappy children! Be Faustina, sweet, Be our fair mother with untroubled brow, And a babe's faith in pleasure. LUCILLA. That is vain I envy Commodus. FADILLA. What snake is this That strikes out from your eyes? LUCILLA. He has his bent In everything, can ponder till he covets, Then shape his own desire. I envy him His crescent manhood, crescent majesty, The entrancing terror of his yellow locks, Emitting as he passes, sparks of light, So quick, men deem them supernatural, The settled beams of deity. Oh, look! (Enter Commodus.) FADILLA. Great Emperor, here is one who envies you. COMMODUS. How charming! FADILLA. Says that you enjoy and freely All that men sigh for, all that pleases them. COMMODUS. Philosophy, Lucilla! You forget The lessons of our childhood, when, to mock him, We stole upon our father with his books, And then must listen; for he closed the scroll, And spoke it out in homily, caressing As if with phrases if he touched our cheeks. He told us every joy was hollowness That did not spring from reason, and besought us To seek our praise from virtue. Ah, Lucilla, My beauty, 'twas the mirror taught us truth! We stroked the flashing thing, and then fell back, And then approached it, till we understood Our heavenly images. You courted love, Won worship; while for meâhow easily The care of what an after age would say, Buzzing about my name, slipped from my thoughts, When I could hear a veritable shout As every beast I aimed at took the arrow Just in the mortal part and roared acclaim To me as new Far-darter. I have made My pleasures, never found them, never met them Upon the highway, and what pleases there For me has no concern. I am divine: And when endowed with power unlimited, As Emperor, I was met by multitudes Poured forth, with boughs of laurel in their hands And every kind of flower in bloom, I savoured The spring-tide of a god. LUCILLA. When I was empress I made my bliss myself; but now! COMMODUS. I yield you All honour, every ensign of the past, The sacred fire, the purple, for my mother Smiles through your beauty when I give it sway: 'Tis so I honour her. This rippled hair Holds to the temples just as hers, this chin Knows nothing but of homage. You are sore, Lucilla, that you cannot keep your throne Beside me as sole Empress; but consider, Who is this wife, this rival? A mere form, To ornament my empire, a blank shape, To wear abundant tresses of pure gold, And live unthought of. Do not envy her. LUCILLA. She has my throne. COMMODUS. Not in my heart. This wife, Crispina, holds no place and finds no honour Where, with my kin, a single regnant woman Triumphs above all strangers. (Enter Marcia.) Love, the jewels Flash round your brow; it is not framed for flowers. MARCIA. They fade. I never wear them. COMMODUS. You will come To the arena? MARCIA. Pardon me, my lord. Spring lies too vast and sweet before my thoughts For sight of carnage, and I bent my steps To this soft, murmuring place to gather calm. I will be ready to receive my lord, Ah, exquisitely ready, in an hour. Grant me but that. I do not need the mirror, The unguent for renewal half so much As the touches of the air. COMMODUS. Then, if we part, We, when we meet again, must lavish welcome Inordinately full of joy. Lay on Your breast all stones of azure and of green, Meet me as Juno's bird. My Marcia, hear! The amphitheatre's challenge! Te saluto, Marcia! Slaves, heigh! Conduct me to the games. (Exit Commodus.) FADILLA. Fair lady, will you pace with me? I too Would feel the stroking gentleness of eve, When flowers and birds and winds are young together, And Eros loves them all. Lucilla, listen, My pious, star-ensnared conspirator, To anything that love with Maia's voices May whisper to you. Let the hour appeal, And all the hour enjoins. MARCIA. Your servant, princess. (Exeunt Fadilla &amp; Marcia through an arcade.) LUCILLA. Venus, the nightingales begin to sing Behind their footsteps; it is safe to call. I die . . . The boughs are shaking. O Quadratus! My throat is dry, he cannot hear my voice. Quadratus! QUADRATUS. (Among the boughs.) Love, your clasp!. . . The judas-tree . . . Behind this branch! Give me your hand: a pulse Is throbbing through the palm. LUCILLA. Speak of the deed, Speak coldly. QUADRATUS. Peer down through the blossoms, sweet. You torture me. LUCILLA. Not now. I will not stay! You shall not drag my arm. QUADRATUS. (Stooping forward.) Down to our secret, This bosomed dagger. Now, my waxen beauty, You light, you glisten. I must have you swear, Swear by the hilt . . . LUCILLA. You speak so noisily! Be silent; oh, be swift! I suffer torments, Stung by a need, a wish so obstinate, While all beside revolts. QUADRATUS. Your oath: but first, Your brother will returnâbe certain, sweetâ By the dark, eastern passage? LUCILLA. I am sure. QUADRATUS. He never will arrive. Swear by your eyes, Your empire, that you love me and will love And crown my love and when the days are safe Make me at last your husband. LUCILLA. I have sworn. My fate is yours. We cannot now draw back, Can we, Quadratus, from the coiling deed That holds us to it? QUADRATUS. Are you false? Draw back! Half of the senate holds to our attempt, And you have sworn you will not rest until I rule beside you. How you damp my heart! Each moment of delay is risk of life To me, to you, to all who follow us. LUCILLA. You mean that I am taken in a net, That none of you will loose me. QUADRATUS. None, my bird; I least, your lover. By your oath, your cause, By all the noble blood that glows for it In youthful veins swayed by your loveliness, We are committed to this night's attempt. LUCILLA. We are. Then loose me. Give me back my empire, Give me my throne! We must not speak together Till we are joined by . . . Oh, spur on the deed! Its issue is our freedom: we shall laugh And kiss and chide and trifle, when 'tis done. Leave me and do my will. (He lowers the dagger to her, hides it and goes out, while she watches him motionless as in a trance. Turning suddenly, she starts at the sight of her mother's statue.) What stable whiteness! I would that I were human, she a ghost; But I am marble too; all things are done Round me as if round marble. Some events Come thus, while we are stone. Fadilla thought That I was here for pleasure, tender aim Of grove and sky, I cannot share! (Pylades enters through the flowering trees.) The sounds Of spring, each one a little, separate joy, Self-gratulating, strike me envious. The world is filling so with love. (Perceiving Pylades.) Ye gods, A messenger?âwith face like Ganymede's, Enticing kisses through the roseate pendants And clusters of the branches. One, a million, (She catches &amp; kisses him.) For each is perfect, and the blossoms press So softly to my forehead. Apparition From Paphos, it may be I take farewell Divine of love and happiness. You struggle, Shame-faced and downcast, a mere mortal boy, A slave, no matter if to me a god. Nay, I will loose you. You have had the kisses Of a sad, desperate woman. You may go. There, take your liberty! (Exit.) PYLADES. It was the Empress Herself who kissed me; I am half afraid, And the great wonder too! What did she mean? She said I was slave, yet her embrace Thrilled me as if with freedom. Oh, for that, For freedom! And he sighed I was a god To her . . . Apollo, make me god to all, When on the Emperor's birthday I shall dance The presence of thy deity 'mong men, Thy servitude in Arcady, thy folding Of flocks to music! I will practise it: For I can bring to mind the canticle, So often having heard it to my steps. (He sings, moving in pantomime to the words. Marcia, coming unseen by Pylades down an alley, watches him.) Climb with me, Laomedon's white fleeces, Upward to the hill-tops, up to Ida, To unshaded dews and earliest dawning. Young and lustrous, god and yet a servant, As a star past rock and tree I climb. Raise your heads erect, ye flocks, and listen To the note I strike from off my lyre! They have heard, they stand each head erected; Thus they wait the Grazing-Tune that woos Slowly to the ridges and the sky. I have struck it: all submissive listen, Till they feed in mystery, advancing, Drawn to solemn paces by a spell; Then to sharper strains one way they hurry, Fleece by fleece around me, till I strike Sweet, soft notes that lay them down to slumber, I beside them, where the sun no more Falls across us, but the chilling moonlight: There we sleep, my flock and I together, I, a god, though servant of a king. (He dances the folding of the flock again, mutely, as if not satisfied with the gestures &amp; attitudes he had taken.) MARCIA. (Apart.) He sees his god, Ay, as he is and in his native land; Can show him to the crowd. I envy him. It is my vileness binds me to the Cross, My bartered beauty, my disgrace. For outcasts My awful outcast Deity, with birthright Even to the throne of Zeus. The song again. PYLADES. Climb with me, Laomedon's white fleeces, Upward to the hill-top, up to Ida, To unshaded dews and earliest dawning. Young and lustrous . . . (His voice dies away &amp; he again tries other gestures.) MARCIA. (Apart.) Ah, the Nazarene Will never draw the flower of men, or breathe Warm on their flowering days. For innocence, For the prayers that youth makes, speaking to itself Or kindled by bright gales, He has no ear. (Pylades suddenly approaches the statue of Apollo.) PYLADES. O Genius, O my Patron, thou that guardest My tireless feet, the singers and the flutists Who sing and play, while I am dancing thee, Receive thy gifts of music and of verse: Dower me with thine own life, breathe through my motions, Act in me bodily, and fill all eyes With presence of thy godhead; for thou can'st, O Delphicus! (Enter Eclectus with a scroll.) ECLECTUS. (To Pylades.) Begone! You dare intrude, You, in this grove! MARCIA. (Advancing.) Why do you strike the boy? I heard his voice afar, and he is fashioned To stand unchidden 'neath the dangling purple And knots of blossom. Do not banish him. (To Pylades.) What is your name? PYLADES. They call me Pylades. ECLECTUS. A pupil from the schools, a pantomime, Named from his master Pylades, a Greek, A slave . . . (Presenting a scroll, as Pylades draws back among the trees.) I bring you message from the mines Where in Sardinian caverns by the sea Your Christians suffer; you can ransom them, Such is their faith . . . (Eclectus pauses while she reads.) But, Domina, the means That they propose? You are my Empress; nothing That you effect, touching the state, is foreign To me, your chamberlain. I hate these Christians, I fear their subtlety, their favouring wiles, I fear lest they bring peril on your head. Tell me, how would they draw you to their rescue? The means? MARCIA. Myself, my place. O chamberlain, You know how I am ranked. ECLECTUS. You are an Empress, My lord's Augusta. Keep your majesty. MARCIA. I am a Christian. ECLECTUS. You have no religion; You cannot have; you are yourself divine. Think of your worshippers, establish them, And set yourself deep in the stars. O lady, Let me not see you fall, a meteor, A fickle, broken light. You are a goddess To my great lord, to me. Sway over us! MARCIA. I count among the slaves. ECLECTUS. Is it as such You hope to win your will? Base to my lord, And, oh, most base to Rome, thus to betray her To those who have no country and no king, Who flatter and revolt. MARCIA. Even an Empress, Eclectus, may beseech the life and freedom Of chosen captives. ECLECTUS. You speak truth, but these, Your Christians . . . Will you read? (Marcia is silent.) Not from the scroll, From lips of their own messenger I learnt Their infamy; they bade me seek you out In secret, praying you would use your beauty, Your power, your arts, your place . . . MARCIA. Go! Say, Eclectus, I am a servant well-equipped to serve. (Exit Eclectus.) I have my power; I dare not cast it off; For power discarded brings a great revenge: But in myself my life is as a leaf Wind-blown to utter ruin, carrying Its death along with it. I wonder where The truth is hid in me? With Commodus, My golden athleteâfor I love his strength, The straightness of his aim, his open mimes And the summer in his temperâor the Church, That leads me through dark places to the stars? Oh, I am unredeemed; I cannot pray! But when I creep down to the Catacombs, And see the faces there, and for lustration, O God, Thy bloodâThou offering it, not slainâ Then I have craving for the utter white, For Thee, O Spotless! PYLADES. (Watching her at a distance.) This is Niobeâ How perfect!âfor she stands alone and weeps; And yet one feels about her breast and feet Her children clinging. Is she Niobe? The supplication in her eyes, her tears! (Fascinated, he draws close up to her: at the sound of his footsteps she turns, smiling, toward him.) MARCIA. So you desire your freedom? PYLADES. Past all hope. MARCIA. And on the Emperor's birthday you will dance Apollo and the folding of the flocks. I shall be there. PYLADES. You will! Before I sleep I always pray the gods to make of me A perfect dancer, and then ask their blessing Upon all beauteous things. Between my prayers, I will make one for you. MARCIA. Sweet boy, my thanks. PYLADES. The Emperor's birthday! (He runs off among the trees.) (Marcia, seating herself, reads the scroll; the she looks up from it.) MARCIA. I will liberate Thy servants in the mines; and for Thy sake, Thine too, the Greek, who dances to Apollo, Shall dance in freedom. I am chosen thus: Though my pure God can never dwell with me, And all my days must pass in dust and shade. (Re-enter Lucilla.) Empress! LUCILLA. My brother, will he come? MARCIA. Not yet; You hear the strife still clangs. LUCILLA. âNot yet, not yet!â But one may clog impatience till it frenzies. To tear up flowers be sacrifice to words As cruel as âNot yet!â Before their hour Let these red hundreds perish. What, you smile? (She strips a tree of blossoms.) MARCIA. O lady, at this fury kindly urged On senseless objects. So your royal brother Shatters his murrhine vases at a blow If one he loves offend. LUCILLA. You misconceive. Fair courtesan, what can you know of fury, The royal thing? Your veins have never brewed The dancing ichor. Can you know the play Of Titans with the worlds, the punishment That gods create for laggard destiny? I rend these showering multitudes, with force To dissipate the stars, the race of men. Oh, I am hot with labour! MARCIA. Nay, take breath. (Re-enter Commodus with Cleander &amp; following.) Look up! LUCILLA. (The rent branches in her hand.) Why, that's my brother Commodus . . . How tossed his hair is! Commodus, I say . . . I cannot. He is murdered . . . Commodus! (She shrieks &amp; falls senseless on the ground.) MARCIA. (Supporting her.) What is her terror? COMMODUS. That I am not dead, That I have found her with her murderer's hands Dangling my crown. MARCIA. O Emperor, she attempted . . . COMMODUS. To slay me in the eastern passage, sweet, To kill me in my heyday. âFrom the Senate,â Her lover cried, âand from Lucilla,â failing Just by that cry to triumph. Look at her, Look at her, look! The likeness: why, it seems As if my mother lay there on the ground In a swoon of fast-clenched hatred. Nature, nature! And I was disciplined to love her law, And listen to her promptings as to truth. Lies, lies, my philosophic father, lies! Nature is false, or this is not my sister, My mother in each trait. But where is truth? Why, in this body that is safe from Mors, The archway-haunting spectre, safe for feasts And love and glory and divine excess. Crowns for the revel! In great cups of wine Memory shall drown . . . but I must test the drink Before I swallow: each imperial dish Must wait its herald, the sure antidote. Take up that woman; thrust her in a cell Close as the grave. She is not yet unbrothered; I will not have her slain before my eyes. But shut her close. (Dragging Marcia by the hand.) And we will come away. MARCIA. Emperor, you cannot mean that you will feast? COMMODUS. All night and on to morning, on to noon, On for three days. It is my gratitude For having hoodwinked nature at her game. Dish after dish! But ere the viands cool There shall be search for stately senators, Dropped sudden from their place to the abyssâ Those agÃ¨d foster-parents that conspired Together for my ruin. I will break Each precious natural bond, and piety, That is but nature's grand-dam, shall be drawn Along the streets and hooted. You agree? Why, I could think you love me, such a flame Is in the eyes you bend upon that traitor, Marcia, my little whore. MARCIA. Lean on my faith. COMMODUS. My pretty wanton, no. I shall discover you some fatal day Drugging my cup. But do not blink! I welcome All monstrous circumstance, all passing riot Of vanities, since all is vanity, Nature and faith and pleasure, fame and love, All indiscriminate deceptions, all Hollows to fill with lamps and laugh beneath. (He totters toward Lucilla, striking his breast &amp; repeating the gestures &amp; words of Quadratus.) âThis from the Senate.â Nay, it is Lucilla That strikes me to a spectre. How inane The thought that I am living, how it gapes Down to the darkness of a sepulchre. My sister, ho! I would not have her slain, Kept as she is in marble. Come away From death, and pour libations. Flowers and statues, Fountains and jets of foam, my mother's statue, Lucilla's . . . (He comes back &amp; stares vacantly at her, where she lies.) Do you call this place my palace, Or Pompey's Theatre? Soft, Cleander, write me A secret list of all our senators. Marcia, around us, vanity and spring! Leaves, leaves, my father called us. Let us dance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The Central Court of the Imperial Villa at Laurentum. Marble seats among bushes of laurel; tripods smoking with healthful and precious substances. Eclectus &amp; Laetus are heard conversing behind the laurels. ECLECTUS. Welcome! And yet no audience, good Prefect, If you have passed through Rome. LAETUS. Oh, fear me not; (They enter.) I am scarce landed, full of healthful brine, Sick but for news. ECLECTUS. Our exile tells the worstâ Rome is plague-stricken, Tiber in full flood. Famine is in our streets, conspiracy Has been among us and has failed, revenge Is now among us and is doomed to fail; Treason is with the crowd. LAETUS. But this must end. ECLECTUS. Most surely it will end and of itself. LAETUS. How of itself? ECLECTUS. The ancient deities Are in their place; do not inquire of me. Is Thebes disrooted? You have seen the sphinxes, The obelisks, the congregated kings Huge on the painted sunshine. Power prevails; But then how fed, how lighted! What is Power? O Roman, did you catch the meeting lips Of the Sun-God and Amenophis? LAETUS. Nay, nay! Religion holds me not. ECLECTUS. I did but speak Of Egypt and its clear, vibrating air. Why leave a shore so healthful? LAETUS. Yet, I trust There is no peril here. ECLECTUS. Where destiny Fulfils itself as in the Roman streets, That pour their starving hosts to threaten us. Look well to the Pretorians; they are sullen, And if they fail we perish. LAETUS. I am warned. (Exit.) ECLECTUS. Sight of this fellow-mortal come ashore, Safe from the waves, to close with deadly pest, Renews the trepidation in my veins For her, for Marcia. Blow, Hesperian breezes, Blow steady through her lintel, give her health, O my rose-lotus! Let the fatal barque Sink with its thousands, if the flower of women Is left on earth, unrent from us. The plague, The terrorâthey have taught me how I love. (Enter Commodus.) COMMODUS. Where is the lady Marcia? ECLECTUS. Still within. No one has seen her stirring. COMMODUS. You stand there As if you feared to speak. ECLECTUS. (Bowing low.) Lend me you ear; Be patient with my loyalty. You dream That you are safe; and from the pestilence You have security; but through these laurels Your flattering nobles let no rumour pierce Of deep-revolting Rome. Your minister, The base Cleander, keeps, as private wealth And fast-locked treasure, corn that should be flung As bounty to the crowd. Food for the people Is secret of all godlike sovereignty: The famished multitudes are flocking to you Behind these gates; and, when they come, prepare The morsel to their appetiteâCleander. COMMODUS. Another face to toss down to the void, And turn from ruddy pleasantness to pale And grinning horror! What is this you counsel? Famine is but the plague in leaner form, A visitation from the gods. Cleander Keeps these afflictions from me. ECLECTUS. But prepareâ COMMODUS. O fool, this is Laurentum and not Rome. Here I take rest from caresâno early visits From formal nobles; the huge day to fill With simple pastime and the solaces Olympus smiles at! ECLECTUS. Laetus is within; Make sure of the Pretorians. COMMODUS. Cease this folly. Go, give command the Bestiarii Uncage that lion with the jutting tooth. He shall affirm my prowess. (Exit Eclectus.) I am here A true divinity, among these odours, Among these mounting flames. Let me conceive That they burn up to me! And let Rome perish, Or send her suppliants hither! Sweet to snuff The heated fragrance. But how still it is! No lizard threads his crevice: all the air Pauses for some event. Lucilla lives, Yet while she lives my heart keeps dropping blood. (Drawing a parchment from his sleeve.) If I should do it, A gulf would open at my very feet, A dark abysm, with one staring face To hold me to the bottom of the void. She is a traitor . . . but that opes no gulf. It is the refuse we throw in ourselves Reeks from the fissure up to us, or gives Its altered visage back. I am her brother. See, if I look down in this fountain's bowl, I see her brother's face, gold Commodus, How handsome and how young! If I should do it! Her death is written: or is this the parchment That grants her pardon and oblivion? It is the parchment. Then I shall forget her, And then . . . Ah, Zeus, thy eagles and their prey! I must have idols, if I am a god! (Marcia enters from without.) Bright apparition! What, my Morning! Health Stepping to meet me! Were you always young As now, this holy lustre on your face . . . MARCIA. And yet the secret of it! From the caves I come and from the spices of the tomb. COMMODUS. Marcia, you breathe it! . . . From the sepultures Of your foul out-casts, from your buried godâ And this mock radiance on your face . . . You shall not! The peril, gods! MARCIA. I shall not bring the plague. COMMODUS. Your feet have trodden it. To lose you, dearest, To lose you! You must never pass again, Never desert me for a single hour. MARCIA. I will not. If I savour of the tomb The secrets of my wondrous shadow-land Are left behind, and I am sprung from Hades, Eurydice, not praying to turn back, Praying to walk with you, to share your griefs And lighten them, if you will give me place Beside youâ (Commodus laughs.) Not as Empress: as one sent, A slave, a common hireling, but yet chosen To guard you, O my Golden-haired, from death. COMMODUS. What flowers are in your voice! If I could trust you, If you could give me love! MARCIA. A faithful servant . . . Oh, were you fashioned to believe! . . . has something Created in his heart, something most real, Something most sure; and it is thus I hold you Amid the hollow gulfs. COMMODUS. I loved my mother, And when I think of her a gravity Falls on my thoughts; then I am Commodus, Solid and with ambition. But you cheat me. Are you not cheated too at every turn? You cannot love me though I give you all, And you can pour no happiness: your heart Is void and bitter. (A Priest of Cybele enters &amp; chants to his brazen rattle.) MARCIA. (Drawing her hand across her forehead.) Note the spectacle! PRIEST. Cybele, Cybele, save us from death, Cybele, Cybele, strong to aid! Fierce is the plague, fiercely it clears harvests of men from the light. Cybele, Cybele, who now shall reap. Cybele, Cybele, who shall bind? Save us from death, taming the plague as a forest lion is tamed, Mother of all, Goddess most good, rolling in pomp through the lands. (The Courtyard fills to the Priest's chant: Pylades is among the pages.) COMMODUS. I am arrested by this priest: he clangs, And clangs and clangs, and so the earth is ruled By one sole iteration. Corybant, I would speak with you of your mysteries. This for your altars. (Gives a carcanet.) PRIEST. You would join the train? COMMODUS. I cannot; I am secret to myself, I cannot join a train. You draw processions . . . So, I would draw them. PRIEST. You have cast aside Your carcanet: if you would lead the frenzy I marshal, you must put away your nature, Your manhood, pass a mutilated slave Before the city. We, who are religious, Are silent-lipped till we can speak with those Who have put nature off. COMMODUS. And then? PRIEST. The frenzy, The exaltation! We attain the god. Then we can succour multitudes and bind them Fast to our car, for then they grow confused Between us and the power that ravishes. You must not stay my cymbals. Rome is stricken, I am her saviour. Give, and join the cry! (He passes on clashing &amp; begging; the crowd follows.) COMMODUS. A crowd is gathering round the Corybant, And I am left in shade. Put nature off! Ay, so I will, and then these mysteries Will open to me. If indeed there were A secret and a perfume at the flower Of this wild ritual! But the priest assumes; He is an actor merely. Oh ye gods, Ye gods, I am your equal; ye but dream And dream, and dream your greatness and your blood. That is reality. So you become Or Zeus, or Hercules, or what you will; All is as you have breath for in your sighs. Marcia, you shall behold! I was about To slay a grisly lion, as an archer With mortal strength: now I am Hercules Eager to rid Nemea of her pest. MARCIA. Ah, could you succour Rome! COMMODUS. That is no dream, With that is no reality: the people Are all illusion and their cries a painting To rub off from the air . . . We must put nature by, her cries, her qualms, Leave her to perish as a wailing child Far off behind us. I shall lead a train; You will be here to greet me. 'Tis not love I ask for: be my echo through the hills, Answer me back with softer voice, and I Will ravish and undo you. Ecstasy! (He goes out.) MARCIA. (Wringing her hands.) He is beside himself! To see him borne, Swept on as by an eddy. Commodus! It is as I were calling to the dead. (Pylades creeps up to her &amp; touches her.) Who is it plucks my sleeve? Ah, I remember! (To Pylades.) I think I freed you; that should be enough. PYLADES. It is for freedom To give you counsel. You must recollect I am the substance of which kings are made, Ajax, the vexed Atreidae: all they suffer I feel down to the quick, not from without, As you are feeling. Think! Lucilla's knife Is at his bosom still; and you are cold. You wring your hands. Lady, it is a gesture Of pity for yourself. (Marcia remains silent.) He is a god; Isâah, we know the truth, he dreams it so; And in a dream all must be of one piece, All woven in one spell. Build him an altar, Burn roses to him; then arrest his eye In some great moulded action: if he change, Change too, as, were he ocean-deity, You would become Leucothea. You despise This acting? MARCIA. It is very pitiful. PYLADES. You cannot choose: it is the parts we play With most similitude! If Venus call And we can answer lightly as her doves . . . MARCIA. The counsel of a pantomime. Go, seek Eclectus, bring him hither. (Enter from without Cleander &amp; Slaves bearing arms &amp; garments.) PYLADES. (Shrugging his shoulders.) Yonder pageant Arrests the pantomime. MARCIA. Cleander, stay! What dazzling beams you throw against our faces. This panoply . . . CLEANDER. Dear lady, a new gift For your imperial lover. Gifts and gifts. MARCIA. Obsequious bounty, the mere residue Of hoards beyond all count. CLEANDER. An unkind thought, The oyster must be nacreous in its mould To offer you a pearl. MARCIA. I do not need Excuses for your private opulence: I am not a Provincial you have robbed, Nor a Patrician rendered poor to flush Your coffers and provide gratuity For Emperors. Spare me! (Arrested by the panoply.) But is this your gift? The vizored helmet . . . CLEANDER. Steel and beaten gold. MARCIA. A base secutor's outfit. And you take These gladiatorial weapons, the short sword, Even the apron . . . CLEANDER. Silk! MARCIA. To Commodus! CLEANDER. I meet his craving By liberal fulfilment. Lady Marcia Is less a neighbour to his aspirations Than poor Cleander, though she lay her head Against the subtle heart she fails to know In every turn of fancy. MARCIA. Many years The Emperor has been skilled in archery: Such practice is not infamous; his gods Have sped the dart with scarce diviner skill. But such dishonour as your treachery Would flatter in him is a crime that sullies The universe he governs. If you love, Cleander, if you love him, as you boast, Spare him this fatal tribute, turn the slaves Back with their servile burthen. See, I breathe As if he were in peril of his life. CLEANDER. No, lady Marcia fears her perfect sway Should suffer some abatement, her profession Should lose heart-swelling virtue by the side Of the gladiator's magic. I will stir The strife and watch its issue. Slaves, proceed. MARCIA. Most wicked demon! CLEANDER. (To Pylades.) You shall earn twelve pieces Of gold to-night at supper, if you dance Your Pyrrhic dance for one. And let your flutist Be at your side in readiness, my sweet. (He pulls the dancer's ear caressingly &amp; goes out with his slaves in the opposite direction.) PYLADES. (Breaking into laughter.) Secutor! MARCIA. Hush, you laugh! There is no evil Not to be looked for, but if this befall All things are overthrown. The darkness closes Around me, and I feel that torrent powers, As I defy and promise to arrest them, Are eddying me away. Ah, Pylades, What is your counsel now? PYLADES. You need no counsel: Forget it all. Be but the thing you are, Sightless, and full of ruin. Weep and weep, But not for Rome. MARCIA. I cannot weep for him. Secutor, oh! (Sound of voices &amp; laughter.) And it may be even nowâ I hear his voice, the honey in its tone It breathes when soft in triumph. He is happy, And yonder is Cleander. PYLADES. Shroud yourself. MARCIA. Is he accoutred? PYLADES. You must pass within; I will observe in secret. MARCIA. A secutor! But I will seek the Princess; she will feel The ignominy slip into her blood. PYLADES. Pass quickly. (Exit Marcia, Pylades hides in the laurels, while Commodus, dressed as Hercules in a lion-skin, Cleander &amp; a bevy of pages &amp; women fill the enclosure.) A brave troop of revellers! And now I catch the theme. 'Tis Hercules, And all his little handmaids buzzing round With kisses and with praise. A rich diversion, To watch the Emperor playing pantomime. And what a rose, that Sagana! COMMODUS. (To Cleander.) You fashion My dreams to my own liking: that is greatly And truly to be served. Before to-night I shall be Paulus the secutor; now Your Lucius Commodus is Hercules, The slayer of a lion, such a beast, An old and brindled sire, whose belly sent Its hungered bay up that had been a roar But that I cut it silent. From the conflict I come to rest. How exquisite a dream! I breathe Olympus, and, my labours done, My burning sweat washed off, I am exalted, As mortals ever must be to enjoy Things perfectly celestial. Scatter flowers To fill the air with coolness; fetch a cup Crowned with dawn-fabling roses to the brim. Be goddesses beside me, be as gods; Let me create my creatures deities, As I endue myself, my strength, my beauty, With Herculean honours and the name Of Jove's unconquered son. (Pylades slips away among the laurels.) CLEANDER. You need a goblet Worthy divineness of so high a reach. COMMODUS. And such you can present? Go, fetch your marvel, My little, own Cleander. CLEANDER. With six pounds Of the best perfume of Niceros, worthy The nostrils of a god! COMMODUS. Gifts, ever gifts! And always gold to meet expenditure; That is the one solidity of dreams. (Exit Cleander.) And his last thought, the perfume! Sagana, Soft as the spray, soft-bosomed as the rose, Give me your hair for cushion. I am weary; Fall round me and in concert hymn my toils. (Closing his eyes.) How slumbrous in this land of cooler air, Abounding with the laurel, in the smell Of the sweet laurels, in the pleasant shadow To hear each valiant act on women's voices, As if it donned queen Omphale's attire. FIRST SEMI CHORUS. Great Hercules in the Nemaean vale Threw down his weapon on the sedgy grass, And strangled the red lion with his hand. SECOND SEMI CHORUS. And Lucius Commodus before the world Struck dead a hundred lions, dart by dart; Laid them in order on the drunken sod. FIRST SEMI CHORUS. Great Hercules from fresh Arcadian woods Bore the gold-antlered stag to Tiryns home, The stag of Artemis with feet of brass. SECOND SEMI CHORUS. And Lucius Commodus struck down in death Camelopardalis, the stag with neck Tall as a fir and spotted as the plane. FIRST SEMI CHORUS. Great Hercules through dazzling Psophian snows Chased the tusked boar, and chasing mid the cold, Caught him at last o'er-wearied in a net. SECOND SEMI CHORUS. But Lucius Commodus had rarer sport, For with one aim he felled rhinoceros, Of bulk gigantic, armed with hideous tusk. FIRST SEMI CHORUS. Great Hercules slew the Stymphalian birds Beside the lake's swift-sliding waves; in vain Were brazen claws and beaks and arrowed plumes. SECOND SEMI CHORUS. And Lucius Commodus with crescent darts Struck Mauritanian ostriches, in flight, That skim the ground on wings like swelling sails. COMMODUS. Five of my dozen Labours! Oh, this chaunt Rises an odour from those flowersâyour lips! FIRST SEMI CHORUS. Great Hercules . . . (Fadilla &amp; Marcia enter like mourners.) ALL. See, see! (The women scream.) COMMODUS. 'Tis rash to steal Like ghosts upon my dream, 'tis a fresh murder. To wound me now will draw the thunderbolt. Away, or learn That visions crush like mountains when they fall. Vanish together! . . . Marcia, you draw close; Marcia, your eyesâthe murdering, white light! Leave me, fair boys; more room, a wider circle, My wreath of coloured petals! Marcia, speak, Or die 'mid this god's feast! MARCIA. 'Tis you must die, My lord, unlessâ (To Fadilla.) But tell him, Princess, all. He will believe a lady of his blood. Tell him of ruin, tell him he has lost The Roman people, tell him he has lost The moiety of his guard, that he must dread From his own subjects what could never chance By hand of barbarous nation. (Re-enter Eclectus.) ECLECTUS. All is lost; Your Guard is broken; you are now defenceless, And on the brink of slaughter. CIRCLE. Save us! FADILLA. Save Yourself, my dearest, for we speak but truth: Outside these walls a fiery hatred marshals The citizens. They have a single shout Of hunger after justice, and one name For all they hateâCleander. Every voice Demands his head. COMMODUS. An execrable plot! I cannot listen any more to words; They are the language of conspirators. (To Marcia.) But you have put your beauty quite away, Made yourself hideous, distasteful. There, Again I catch design; my sister tooâ Cleander smote her lover. Envious, ha! That was Lucilla's keynote. Agony! I will not give him up. MARCIA. He is a traitor. I say this in Truth's name. COMMODUS. And through your eyes I look as to the bottom of the well. Marcia, come nearer! You are deadly sure . . . ? MARCIA. Eclectus! COMMODUS. No; swear to me by your eyes . . . MARCIA. Cleander is a traitor. He has brought A host together, he has armed your people To strike you dead unless you quell this strife: He fraudulently bore the public grain To private granaries, till famine raged, And still it rages on. Although I tremble To move you with the sorrow worst to man Of finding falsehood in the services That fashioned every day, I, who must die So soon beside you, yet proclaim with Rome Cleander is a traitor. (She gazes into his eyes.) COMMODUS. So you doom him, So! Woman, how I hate you. From his youth, When every office nearest to myself Was his, and he familiar with my pleasures, My needs, my health, my privacy, my sleep, Even then he was a traitor? All must end If such a hollow, such inanity Gape round me as existence. (Re-enter Cleander.) Let him die! CLEANDER. The cup! COMMODUS. He promised me To bring it; it is brought. A poison-bowl! Drink, drink, Cleander; pledge me! (Cleander, startled, drops the cup &amp; crouches at his feet.) CLEANDER. I am lost, Crushed by your sudden anger. Could I drink? 'Twas an oblation. Are you not a god, And through my service? Dare you cast me off? Dare you discard such deep fidelity? Gods do not so desert. ECLECTUS. You are condemned, The crowd impatient. CLEANDER. Master, by our youth, By all my fond devotion . . . If I erred, It was for you. I twisted circumstance For you, I stole, I lied . . . MARCIA. Laetus! CLEANDER. Her voiceâ The harlot, my accuser! MARCIA. Laetus! (Laetus enters with soldiers.) COMMODUS. Take Your victim, offer him! (Cleander is dragged away. Commodus wraps his face in his mantle.) I shut my ears. Truly I am a god; 'tis on this wise The gods abandon, deaf to circumstance. (A long pause.) You cannot rate him. Why, he kept my rooms: A little Phrygian slave, the cryer offered, They bought him for me, and he jigged a dance Of the mountain-loving Mother the first night He placed my pillow. Marcia, cling to me! MARCIA. My lord! COMMODUS. Cling, cling as to a drowning man. O Veritas, I loved him. Do not weep. (A distant cry &amp; shouts are heard.) For me I must. A ghost cries after me; And at the little bloodless Hades-moan My heart grows soft. MARCIA. Oh, steel yourself. Cleander Has fallen justly. COMMODUS. So you will not weep! He shall have justice in the Shadow-land. Some parchmentâquick! (Exit.) FADILLA. What moves him? MARCIA. Something moves, Something! When men rise restless from their tears One must not ask their errand. (Re-enter Pylades.) Pylades! PYLADES. My master Pylades! Great lady, help! Save him, O save my master! He is called Cleander's friend, he is my most beloved. You of the irresistible petition, Who gave me freedom and Cleander death, If what is terrible has terror for you, The dreadful gulf, the joyless bark, deliver My master from the teeming river-side. Oh, he is hunted! ECLECTUS. Marcia, do not listen. MARCIA. I speak for your dear master. You, Eclectus, Take the poor boy away; see, I confide him To your protection. (She pushes Pylades behind Eclectus, on whom she leans for a moment, steadying herself.) ECLECTUS. He imperils you. MARCIA. Hush, hush! Do you not hear the raving noise, The loose, unguided step? Now if you love me, You must not interpose. It is my hour, And I alone can reckon with his mood. (Re-enter Commodus.) COMMODUS. This Justice is a dazzling wanton, heady, Reckless and wild as Fortune's very self, Who gives her favours to the meanest traitor, Denies no man her bosom, fondles ghosts! Ah, that is novel. Marcia you remain The statue that I left. MARCIA. Your will, my lord? COMMODUS. Most docile and most sweet, you will not blench. I shall not see you weep! Call Laetus, call him, As but a little while ago you called. MARCIA. Laetus! COMMODUS. He tarries. (Eclectus moves forward, discovering Pylades.) ECLECTUS. Let me bear your will. COMMODUS. (To Pylades.) Noâhere is one. Come hither to my side, Thou hyacinthâblossom, thou most sweet exchange For bloodshed and a god's dull agony. You weep, you weep. PYLADES. My master! COMMODUS. Flower of Darkness, Breathe me your sighs, and let me gaze on you, Till grief is but a fragrance. And your sorrow, Your suit? PYLADES. My master! Empress, speak for him. You promised . . . MARCIA. (Her hands on Pylades' shoulders.) Nay, he best can plead, he begs The life of Pylades, the pantomime, His master in the dance, a fugitive; But cannot speak for weeping. COMMODUS. (To Pylades.) Bear this sentence Forth to the hall, to Laetus. It condemns, One I found wholly guilty: she must die. FADILLA. Gods, 'tis Lucilla! COMMODUS. Bear the sentence, beauty; And I will be your master. Dry your tears. Ah, Marcia, this is well; you do not move. MARCIA. How could I? COMMODUS. What a rigid ugliness You stand. I hate you. MARCIA. (Throwing off her black cloak &amp; veil.) But this bitter mourning Is past, the mourning of my widowhood; For you are safe. (Kneeling.) And now, my lord, in token You love this Marcia who has clung to you, Who clings, will cling forever, grant this boon: Forget Lucilla. Do not pardon her; I cannot, but forget her. And, to keep Our names together, grave me on a medal With you, your Amazon. So I am thanked For this day's service that has guarded you, Has kept you mine. COMMODUS. Magnificent! O pride! My Empress, my deliverer! MARCIA. (Presenting Pylades.) This freedman Of mine shall be your servant. Yield protection To his old master, he will straight forget him, And dedicate to you the arts, the grace Inclined you to him as a messenger. Speed him with mercy. COMMODUS. (To Pylades.) What a sob! You promise You will forget your master? PYLADES. Save him swiftly, Or he will perish with Cleander's friends. My most-beloved! COMMODUS. For that he perishes. My fleet, young god, but you shall see the shades Grow pale with horror! I will people Hades Thick as the Roman-streets. But first Lucilla! Carry the sentence! (Marcia presses back the parchment against his breast: he strikes her heavily.) MARCIA. Commodus, this touch Is new to me . . . Eclectus, quick, your hand!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. An Ante-room of the Regia: to the right the Imperial Bedchamber, to the left the Bathroom. Gladiatorial weapons lie about in confusion. A statue of Janus, wreathed, stands in the midst. It is the last day of the old year 192. Eclectus, Sagana, &amp; Folia. SAGANA. We wait to arm the Emperor; it is dull To wait so long, to wait so anxiously, To shake one's bracelets or re-bind one's tresses Hour after hour. FOLIA. I tremble in each limb At thought of his approach. SAGANA. And yet that fan Of peacock-plumes, that loveliest veil of Cos, Like water round your bosom! FOLIA. What are they? If you had suffered ridicule and insult Cruel as I have borne, your plumes and gauzes Would hang as on a pyre. ECLECTUS. This lady carries Her hoops of pearl with spirit. SAGANA. I have learnt My lesson from our queen of concubines, The royal Marcia: for to daunt our lover, Grown fatal since he shed his sister's blood, She meets him in the kirtle and the arms Of a defying Amazon. He yields On the instant to the freshness of her challenge; He turns her slave, and her bold fancy masters His thralled belief. She might have been a mime, She acts with such free grace the part she chooses; Not Pylades himself can rival her. Some say he taught the new Hippolyta The carriage of her shield, her doughty motions, The port of her scant tunic. ECLECTUS. It is false. A most injurious falsehood! She herself Dared all to cow the fiction-loving temper Of Commodus, and gloriously prevailed. SAGANA. Nude from the knee! ECLECTUS. Her faceâthe floating hair Soft round the helmet-cap; the face in arms. SAGANA. Then you admire her aspect, and the fiction Gains on your faith. ECLECTUS. We need some ancient stories To help us to live on. FOLIA. I cannot feign. I can but pray âO Janus, close the past.â ECLECTUS. And I would pray âMake open vista for another year!â Life passes like a ship, O Lord of Time, Before thy twofold office. FOLIA. Hark, at last The Emperor quits the bath; I hear his feet Splash on the marble. I am cold, so cold! But Marcia comes. (Enter Marcia as an Amazon &amp; her servant Jallia.) MARCIA. The Emperor is within? Eclectus, greeting! I have bought my gifts Against to-morrow: and a flood of sun Has filled the shops, has lighted up the coins Of Janus, made the sweetmeats jewel-bright, And purchasing a holiday employ That wasted hours. I scarcely found a moment To don my armour and disguise myself; Yet Jallia would not help. ECLECTUS. The child looks pale, Your little servant. MARCIA. Winter-pallor, nothing But discontent with one who is beloved. Heigh-ho! The shops were gay, and as a bride I trafficked everywhere and laughed, such gladness, Strong as a panic, rocked my heart. This sun! Your ancient god of light is god of change: What would he do for me, even me? Remember How I was born to these divinities, And with my father and my mother worshipped Our Janus, this dear symbol of a truth, Time's image, that divine Eternity Hath dispossessed of worship. Jallia shakes Her solemn head, and you, Eclectus, fix Your eyes on me as on the midnight stars. I am a Christian, and to me at last Old things are new; but Jallia hates the old. JALLIA. (In a sweet undertone.) As false, abhorred, forbidden. MARCIA. Child, not so; Their power is in them always, and the passage Of old year into new for ever shows The countenance of Janus, and for ever Will stir the worship of our time-born race. ECLECTUS. The Emperor! (Enter Commodus from the Bathroom; he is dressed as an Amazon, exactly like Marcia.) COMMODUS. What, my Amazon, fresh-travelled From Thermodon! Before you could arrive I hoped to meet you worthily. Ha, ha! I can but laugh, the cymbals in me clash To hail your gallant fairness. MARCIA. I am merry This morning as if Caucasus had fed me With gustful breezes. And how fares my lord? Fetch me the wine-cup, Sagana. COMMODUS. I slept Unconscionably late, a dreadful sleep Against my will, with none to waken me, And faces round me on the walls of doom. Wine, wine! (Marcia fills the bowl Sagana presents.) Bold cup-bearer, my day begins, My sun first rises with the flush of wine: All other dawn is wan, improvident. You usher-in existence! (He takes the bowl from her.) To his love, My Amazon, your Amazonius drinks. I am entirely yours. You see my shoulder Is bare like this to which I press my mouth, As Mavors feeds his love on Venus' beauty. Your moon-shaped shield between us! Ha, defence! My queen, my queen, I must submit. To-day I front the world your representative In war and conquest, bidden by a dream, That crossed the mournful horrors of my slumber, To wear your garment, swing your moon-shaped shield, Lace on your buskins, press my shorter curls With Amazonian casque, and let the world See me become the woman I adore, As Hercules became. I strive to-day In the gladiators' school, equipped as you, Hippolyta's giant image, sworn to prove How men excel as Amazons the sweet, Long-haired, pearl-tinctured fighters. You grow white? Must a Gargarean in your armour seem So monstrous to your eyes? Hippolyta! You swoon, faint-heart! MARCIA. No, loose me! By the girdle Of Mars, I warn you from such insult: none But women can display the moon-shaped shield. COMMODUS. Who was it, tell me, robbed Hippolyta Of Mavors' belt? Great Hercules, my god, My genius and my heavenly prototype. You make a vain appeal, O warrior-love! An insult: when the Emperor of the world Wears in the world's eye everything that decks you At your most perfect moments; when he vaunts His singleness of worship by the choice Of your attire for clothing; when he stands Like some high peak in snow and steely ice, A masquerading granite. Folia, there, If you would 'scape a spear-prick for your sloth, Search out the moon-shaped shield I bade you borrow From the Lady Marcia's armoury. (Exit Folia.) MARCIA. My lord, You ever have been noble, and with honour, All undeserved, have crowned me in the sight Of Rome and of the empire. See, 'tis I, No Amazon, implores you to accord Still that same honour to your handmaid, still That deep-endearing courtesy. This garb Is but disguise, an actor's make-belief To give you private pleasure: such disguise As Love for lovers puts on trustfully. The Amazon is Amazon to you, Not to the world, the gladiators' gaze, Or the arena's laughter. COMMODUS. You are thankless, Most dangerous to yourself in words like these; A thing to be distrusted and abased. Presumptuous woman, I have honoured you By giving you the purple that I wear, Hanging you with the jewels I have warmed In triumphs and solemnities; no touch Of royalty that gilds me but on you It has been laid: and now when I assume Your raiment, your short tunic, crescent-shield, And manly cap of steel, you round your lips On such a word as âinsult.â When by combats Of valour with my compeers of the sword I seek to make your dress invincible, And in your guise receive the plaudits due To mastery, you, whom I raise to heaven, Cringe and implore retirement and neglect, Or with indifference mock my love, allowing The charm with which you sway it is a lie. If you are not Hippolyta indeed, As I am Hercules on current coin, In everlasting marble; if your mind Can make no truth of life's vacuity, Basing its shadows on the strength of dream, And filling them voluptuously with life-blood Of riotous belief, then . . . . But your face Is dazzlingly an Amazon's. (Folia brings him the armour.) The shield, The cap! I am the champion of this rage. You fire me to exceed it. Arms, to arms! That all may see you triumph. Amazon, Your Amazonius! Nay, you will not kiss! A combat must be won, then lips shall clash; You scorn unwarlike softness. ECLECTUS. Sire, I ask, As from an oracle, will Rome revere An Emperor turned a woman? COMMODUS. Hercules Sits with the gods; he dressed as Omphale. ECLECTUS. The theatres gibe him. MARCIA. Women laugh at him. COMMODUS. They laughâyou say it! And to honour you I took your male caparison, for love Of your enchanting image, for the pastime Of making it death-dealing. It is found A feminine disguise, a harlot's prank, Proud Marcia playing pantomime. You laugh, You, from your womanhood; but I will drag This dress of yours across such infamy As you will recognise. What women dare In secret, and their lovers hide shame-faced, I will expose. My Amazon grows grave: At least no laughter from these lips! Ho, girls, Unmask your mistress, set her in your midst In veils and scarves, a flaunting concubine. (Exit.) (Marcia fixes her eyes on Eclectus, meeting his. The women do not move.) MARCIA. Go, Folia, fetch me from the Emperor's chamber His purple toga. (She sinks down on a couch.) FOLIA. Oh, I dare not, queen, I dare not enter. JALLIA. I will fetch the cloak! (Exit.) MARCIA. (As Sagana &amp; Folia withdraw.) The others slink away. Eclectus! ECLECTUS. Love! You rise as to a call. MARCIA. (She comes to him.) You can forgive Even this disguise? ECLECTUS. Even this. (Jallia returns.) MARCIA. Brave Jallia, thanks. Sweep it around me, sweep it round my knees, Across my breast and shoulder. Let me kiss you, That you refused even once to touch these weapons, This fooling tunic. JALLIA. It was wickedness To wear such garments, vile, idolatrous, Displeasing to our God. (Enter Pylades.) MARCIA. Oh, gently, child! You should be gentleâhappy, safe and tethered In the green pasture. Pylades! PYLADES. You start? Empress, it is the hour you promised me An hour ago; you said you needed practice In the carriage of your spear; you would be ready, Clad as Hippolyta. These trailing robesâ MARCIA. I count my best possession. Come no more. PYLADES. In what have I offended? MARCIA. Go, my mood Is bitter and unjust. PYLADES. You banish me! But if you snatch from me each day's one hour, If you will never come, nor lend a glow To the story of my feet, nor sometimes laugh As when you made me happy . . . MARCIA. Hush, you know I love your dancing. PYLADES. But you shared it, queen; It sprang from your white feet like flaming fire, It wreathed your limbs, it made you in yourself Free as the pliant stars and musical As they in their continuance. One by one, You were all highest goddesses that dance: Hera the Queen, Demeter noble-browed, Athena with severest cadence moving, And heavenly Aphrodite, soft as ocean In step, with windy sweep of golden Loves Round every measure. All that I record Is what you flashed or wove across my eyes. I cannot dream a goddess or a nymph, Or any woman; you have made a pyre Of dim imaginations, you who are The fearful, bright and whole reality. ECLECTUS. (To Marcia.) You scared your women; you are softness now To the sly slave who drew you to his mimes: You love his dancingâay, and to Infernus Would follow him, clear-hearted, jig on jig! (To Pylades.) Begone! PYLADES. You know me of the Emperor's train, Chosen to attend him. ECLECTUS. Where? To the arena, To bathe his wounds if he exceed his godhead, And angry swordsmen mutiny! Begone. PYLADES. Then to the Emperor's rooms, where, chamberlain, You know you cannot flout me. But not there, Unlessâ (To Marcia.) It is your pleasure. MARCIA. Bid farewell. PYLADES. Some mocking cloud is on me from the gods, Not my true patroness. I never bid Farewell to any shape of loveliness In vision or on earth: there, I am free. (He takes up Marcia's spear &amp; shield.) Your shield, your spear! Now you are left defenceless; You will not conquer, woman with no arts, And so no armour! Vale! (Exit into the imperial bedchamber.) ECLECTUS. Insolence! How vile! He treats youâbut it is no matter For my concern, Except that by that madman, that Secutor, That Hercules to match your Amazon, I am (with a laugh) not trusted, but the single creature He would not err in trusting;âchamberlain, And guardian of his honour. Promise me To court that wretched pantomime no more. Burn up the clothes, take off that brutal casque. No vestige of him! MARCIA. For the Emperor's sake I put this armour on: some make-believe Must be where women strive. I strive no more. I am defenceless; I shall cast away The tunic, all the legend. (She gives her helmet to Jallia and dismisses hÃªr.) O Eclectus, Put off your jealous anger, put it off, For it may ruin, and it severs us. ECLECTUS. Are we not severed? MARCIA. But if destiny Grants us no further blessing, if the answer To our dark prayers be this, I am content To breathe with you, to share the mystery Of fate, to part my thought with you as bread, To lie in the dark of human ignorance, Warm in the wraps of love. When souls are bound In such inextricable unity Death fumbles at the knot. ECLECTUS. Oh, hush! My dumbness Cannot break through at once. My love, my secret, I think you have been with me in each barque My soul has steered through Time; yet, agony! I never may possess you. MARCIA. But the joy Is mine of living to you as the grape Lives to the sun, not to the gatherer. (Voices are heard.) LAETUS. (Within.) The deed will cost your life. (Re-enter Commodus with Laetus.) COMMODUS. Eclectus, send The furniture of the imperial bed, The bed and all an emperor's state requires To the gladiators' school: for I will seal The year's commencement with a wondrous vision To hold men's lids apart, while Rome herself Shall quake from Capitol to Vale, beholding Her lord ride forth from those forbidden portals, As Hercules climbed up from Hell's own door. ECLECTUS. You will be slain. If once the crowd admits An insult it is unrelinquishing Till the offender perish. Have you thought, O Emperor, what your deed would violate: The omens of the year, the holiness, The honour of your office, of the world, Yea, of the gods. LAETUS. For you would show yourself As if you lived in infamy among The ever-infamous, the dregs and scum Of serfdom and captivity. COMMODUS. O fools, What am I to my people? Magistrate? The first Augustus laughs. Or general? Vespasian, Hadrian and Titus wink Across their armies. If I claimed a crown As poet, dancer, singer, I must stoop To Nero's coronation. There and there And there, I am not perfectly divine: But each togated soul that claps the games, And every swordsman from the fiercest stress Of battle, every artist rich in lust To feel the clang of metal start his brain, Holds me supreme in the arena, perfect, Miraculous, invincible. MARCIA. He raves Dark-sighted, god-bedazzled! Commodus, I do not doubt you; I would spur you on To brave Hyrcanian tigers. All you will Is yours: in this the gods do not oppose you; That is so terrible! In their contempt The gods do not oppose. You will go down And face the Senate; Janus will be there, And tremble at his office to present To Time this masking figure of a Power So awful. . . . (Turning to Eclectus.) What were Egypt's mummied kings, Their statues and their tombs to the quick CÃ¦sar, Who passes to Olympus' feasts as simply As an invited guest. I see you fall, And stoop and stain your majesty. You shall not. I do not kneel, I do not flatter you; I am your empress in my urgency, I am your empress, for I love your honour Far dearer than my life. You shall not go. (She guards the portal. Commodus lays his hand on his Amazon spear; Laetus &amp; Eclectus range themselves by Marcia to protect her.) COMMODUS. You shall not go! By heaven, I am no god To you . . . You are no Amazon to me; A servant tricked out in her master's robes, A mere false-seeming, a deception, lost To poetry and the truth persuasion rears Among the blossoms of the rose to forge us Belief as stout as mail. How women kill! Cool things, damp airs! No banquetings of men, No festivals of gods, no marriages Of god and mortal but a woman's coldness Can freeze blank-dead. No Amazon to me! All dreams are at an end; the world, that farce Of dancing leaves, that fancied atellan Is breaking into nothing. Fertile Powers, That picture forth the universe, I share Your aimâto plant the void; but I alone Of all the tribe of earth can neighbour you In palpable ambition. Triple band Of enemies, Eclectus, Laetus, you, My empress and my Omphale, my love, The mistress of her master and the tyrant Of the world's bosom . . hence! You are as vain As fraudulent as all things, and as worthy Destruction at my hand. Ha, ha! Begone! You disobey . . . Fear to withstand my actual demon. Go! MARCIA. (Moving from the portal.) Nay, pass my lord, pass to your destiny: I stand aside. COMMODUS. These are your apprehensions, You hollow wanton! So you give your blood To fortify my honour. Oh, the phrases These shadows wear as garments! Now I see From hill-top into valley of your fraud. Traitress, conspirator with him and him, The concubine of both for all I know, For all I care. No protest! (To Eclectus.) Take your serpent, And hide her from the eagle of the world, And the rushing of his feathers. ECLECTUS. He is mad! Marcia, this moment I command you, come! (Laetus covers their exit.) LAETUS. Your will shall be accomplished in all points, Your chamber furnished at the school, your horses Led down, your fatal body-guard prepared. All that your anxious ministers can do To keep you sacred from the touch of harm Shall zealously be done with many prayers. COMMODUS. Ha, ha! With many prayers! (Laetus, with a reverence, goes out.) Are you within, My hyacinth-blossom, Philocommodus? I hear your feet. (Re-enter Pylades.) PYLADES. My Emperor. COMMODUS. Fetch the tablet I laid beside my couch. (Exit Pylades within.) O treacherous spawn! Marcia the chief, as she held foremost place When I was mad, who now am mad no longer, When I, who now can love no more, once loved: Next, her protector, the rose-red Egyptian, Who stood so ornamental in white robes, I made him dear to me, and then that oily, Most Roman Laetus . . . (Re-enter Pylades, as he gives the scroll Commodus kisses him.) Ah, the linden-bark. (He writes, then turns suddenly to Pylades.) Pigeon, you know the slave that yesterday Heated my bath too hot? PYLADES. Diodotus. COMMODUS. (Writing again.) But you are white and trembling. Pass within! Yet first a word, my Philocommodus. If your remembrance hold a thought of him Who called you Pylades, I reckon you My Anteros, and on the wheel or cross, Or by long, undeforming punishments, Shall teach you love by hate. Go, smoothe my pillow. (Exit Pylades within.) All old-year shadows, all should end like days, Like hours, like moments that are stale and crumble In urns or men's oblivion. Marcia, Marcia! But, when my sister failed, I was a fool To build myself upon a concubine. A fool, I am a fool, a sight for gods To thunder at with gross hilarity. I am no son of heavenly Jupiter! See, see! O mirror of myself! (He faces a gold mirror that reflects at the same time a head of Marcus Aurelius.) Heap up The jest, ye Plautus-powers, mirth-makers! See, The statue of my father, our two faces, Our bland and indistinguishable faces, Set cheek by jowlâin marble one, in flesh The other, yet self-sameâour curls, our lids, Smooth skin, caressing beards, and fatuous, Tired smile at all that is not vanity. O husband of Faustina and the father Of Commodus! O good philosopher, To whom the generations were as leaves, And all that he begot and all his fame, And all he loved and hated leaves of spring Consigned in birth to autumn! Such is he. Now rate his son, his double, from the womb Of the famed harlot, whom in appetence He set his eyes and heart on thirty years; His son, the hated of the world, the hater Of every vain allurement that his lust Takes without relish, Commodus the sceptic Of every faculty but sense alone, Its truth of touch, sight, hearing, and their orgies Of blood and lewdness! Judgment! Shouting Heavens, The verdict of your laughter! Is there substance In what we each call voidâfame, propagation, Toil, common joys? Is there in hollowness Some jet of sap we heard not? No, to-day Marcia has put suspicion of a virtue In anything to shame. If I should die She has so wrought I should be simply dead. Tiber flows insignificant, yon fig-tree Stands dark upon the cliff: all's outer show, And there is nothing I can own or covet, I who awakened, as the light, all life, In this once copious universe. Ye twain Athwart the gold, what desert in your eyes, And ignorance how mortal! Worshippers Of harlots, son and father, so disgust Crashes farewell to both. A parricide, Self-murderer too! (He dashes the gold mirror to the ground.) And now for rest, for wine, The blood of sleep, and Lethe, that is sleep's White flesh, forgetfulness. My linden-scroll, Companion of my pillow! (He lays his cheek on it.) Sleep, sleep, sleep! (He staggers into the bed-chamber.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. A Court of the Regia: wings of the royal palaces to right &amp; left, surrounded by a portico that continues along a terrace at the back, commanding through the columns a view of the Capitol &amp; part of the Roman Forum. It is a starry night. Bands of slaves with torches, crowns of flowers &amp; instruments, followed by dancing-girls &amp; beautiful cup-bearers enter the house on the left, but after a while return &amp; hang about the portico. (Eclectus enters from the house on the right.) ECLECTUS. Shall I dismiss the troop, or let them tarry, Vain garlands on the night? Our feast is made; The Emperor lies oblivious. GLAPHYRUS. (At a distance.) Does he come, Our Hercules? ANNIA. (Approaching.) What news, grave chamberlain? 'Tis noised he will salute the Roman year An outcast, such as we. ECLECTUS. It needs your lips, Wanton, to breathe such sacrilege. GLAPHYRUS. Ah, ah! As we! MNEME AND OTHERS. As we! ECLECTUS. But, silence!âor you go, The bevy of you, to sharp punishment. (They shrink back; a shape joins them.) Who comes? GLAPHYRUS. My lord, it is Aurelius Ilyx To wrestle with Narcissus. (Enter Narcissus.) NARCISSUS. I believed The banquet done, the violet-liquors tasted, My match with Ilyx close. ECLECTUS. So spectrelike Grows the long preparation hour by hour For one that does not come! Ilyx, Narcissus, Go up into the Emperor's ante-room; He is besotted and may need your help To reach the feast (apart), and she is there alone. I send a guard. (Exit Narcissus &amp; Ilyx to the right; the revellers laugh together &amp; sing low in the distance.) (Eclectus, left alone, turns to Orion.) Star of Osiris, hear! Fix the great gulf of inability Between my heart and hope. There is no peace Like that when hope is exorcised, no guilt Like that if hope be treason. Pure, white way Of stars above my head, along such path I would attain my happiness! Yet even The stars involve me in disloyalty, Seeming to promise what I most desire. (Enter Marcia down the steps to the right, leading the dwarf Gabba.) Marcia, I pace this threshold at your will. Give me command. MARCIA. From Chaos I am come, And in despair. ECLECTUS. Shall I dismiss that troop? MARCIA. Oh, nothing may be done. ECLECTUS. The Emperor sleeps? MARCIA. With brutal interlude. Take Gabba off; He is a child and helpless. (Eclectus leads the dwarf to the portico &amp; returns.) ECLECTUS. You look weary. MARCIA. The din of the arena in my ears. ECLECTUS. Then he is mad? MARCIA. No, for his head is pillowed. He lies a victim, Bewildered by the godsâSo Pylades Interprets, so it seems. ECLECTUS. The pantomime Is then your fellow-watcher? MARCIA. Tricked as Paris, Waiting to dance. O gods, what do we wait? What is the issue? Is that city Rome? (Rubbing her eyes.) If I could sleep a little! ECLECTUS. I will watch. MARCIA. Here, at the threshold. ECLECTUS. I am chamberlain. MARCIA. And I . . . Oh, leave these titles! (Exit.) ECLECTUS. How forlorn She passes from me; yet this faithfulness To the great injured madness that we serve Imprints me hers for ever. Will he waken? Will he go down to yonder prison-house? The night is drawing closer. (With a gesture of imprecation toward the valley.) O that spot! I dread it as a tomb. My Emperor there, Facing the light Of time and in futurity's fresh dew! Something will intercept. It is forbidden That this law-guarded city, built so slow, Encrusted with such dust, hoarding such treasure, Should be so rifled of itself and by Its inmate and its god. (Enter Pylades from the right.) What, Pylades! Why comes this dizened pantomime to me? Your business? PYLADES. (Giving a scroll.) Take thisâread! ECLECTUS. The Emperor's tablet! PYLADES. I found it lying open by his pillow, Left in forgetful blindness. ECLECTUS. And he calls you His Philocommodus! Take back the scroll You filched from him, the private commentary He makes on each day's circumstance. Begone! (He tosses the scroll back.) PYLADES. You will not read, you will not take this knowledge. Fool, I would have you perish, ah, how gladly Would see you caught in trammels of this gin. But Marcia!âthe swift loss of her! Oh, listen! You will not read? Then hear! The letters flame Scarlet before my eyes. âMarciaââattend! Her name is firstââthen Laetus, then Eclectus Shall die to-night, together with the slave That yesterday heated my bath too hot.â ECLECTUS. Give me the scroll. PYLADES. I bear it on to Laetus; So she commanded. Will you still demur? Within an hour . . . Do you not feel the peril? My lord will wake with all this unfulfilled, This desperate, lurking malice in his heart; And cowering slaves beside him at his motion Ready to draw caged tigers to his couch, That emptying his fury he may sleep. Will you . . . But listen! When she read her name She covered up her faceâthus!âwhile her tears Brushed past the single ruby on her hand, That from its burning dumbness sought to bring Such passion to the birth as in her blood Swooned and was secret. Suddenly she read The tablet further: on the battlefield Of her wan face peace fell like that the moon Pours on the angry faces of the dead, To reconcile them to their new estate Of unabating quietness. She stretched The tablet toward me. âBear it to Eclectus, And afterward to Laetus.â Then she turned: I left her brooding on the Emperor's face With wide, undizzied eyes. ECLECTUS. There, take my cloak; You are half-naked, tremble. PYLADES. As I am For swifter speeding. (Eclectus runs up the steps to the right. The revellers from the portico surround Pylades &amp; hang on him.) ANNIA. Philocommodus! A lovely Paris, with his Phrygian breeches, His jewelled ankles, naked, jewelled chest, And shining mitre; eyes like precious stones, And hairâApollo's, when he hid his darts In his own fleecy locks. GLAPHYRUS. But mark Rome's dancer A cheek like asphodel; a love-sick heart. Which of our girls has struck the shepherd-boy With such white pallor? Mneme, Annia? ANNIA. Nay, Only the fragrant wives of senators Can win a glance from Philocommodus; Or else the concubine of highest fortune; Fame is so choice. PYLADES. Loose me! I bear a message. The Emperor's mood is threatening. ANNIA. Is he ill? MNEME. Or angry? Will he give some dread command Of massacre or torment? PYLADES. None can tell What may be done to-night or who escape, If thus you mob me and delay the fleetness That is alone obedience to his will. MNEME. A lie, a lie! The Emperor is asleep, By yonder quietness over all the house. You would escape us, proud, mendacious boy! ANNIA. Well, if you will not give us smiles, nor words Of kindness, nor a dance, nor rosy kiss, You might remember that my throat is bare Of ornament, my bosom has no gems, Though white as yoursâand softer. MNEME. You are lavish: And a few stones are nothing from your wealth. 'Tis such religion to adore you now Your shrine is always loaded. PYLADES. Will you leave me, At your own price, these jewels? MNEME. Will we go? Yes, Venus' body, if you give us these. PYLADES. (Breaking the string of jewels hanging across his chest.) There, take them all. MNEME. The torches to the ground! What sapphires! O the blue stars of the sky, I covetedânow won! ANNIA. And this dew-diamond! Not yours, 'tis mine. MNEME. No, mine. (Exit Pylades.) GABBA. High Jove, 'tis mine. MNEME. You bunch of roots, no human thing at all, You claim a jewel, you who have no hands! GABBA. I want it all the more, as you will want A lover when your teeth and hair are gone. Ha, ha! Your teeth and hair! ANNIA. A canticle, To drive the time along! And Glaphyrus Shall blow his pipe. GABBA. Then sing the famous hunt Of Calydon, sing how they tracked the boar, One man and woman, dooming him to death, One woman, Atalanta. GLAPHYRUS. (Holding out a castanet to Mneme.) Beat the time. CANTICUM. Within Arcadia, green and lovely land The Calydonian boar Ravaged: he trod the grapes Of summer into wine, He shook the trees of leaves, he fouled the streams, He spoiled the silver fields Of harvest and the golden fields of corn, Sprang on the quiet herd And sleeping sheep, soothed by the rough-hewn pipe Of shepherd from the thyme: Arcadia, ruined by this only foe, Was no more green and fair. But Meleager came from Calydon, A hero, doughty-armed, And with him Atalanta, huntress white, With quiver-parted breasts. Among the woods they ran, And found the boar stretched in terrific sleep. Aroused, he headlong fled In lurid panic through obstructing trees, That stood as to avenge Their savage usage on their flying foe: Motionless hunters, they Helped in his death: the maiden's hurtling spear Struck and her lover's slew. GABBA. They struck, they slew . . . . (Enter Marcia with Eclectus.) MARCIA. Go silently away, All ye that wait the Emperor. He must sleep. Disperse your watch, he will not come to-night. I bid you hence. ECLECTUS. (Apart.) Her voice as from the moon Falls and enlarges solitude. The troop Of feasters soon will fade. VOICES. We go, we go! ANNIA. (In a whisper.) My castanets! MNEME. My garland! (With a smothered laugh.) Ilyx, hush, Be gentle! Glaphyrus no more descants Breeze-murmurs on his flute. GABBA. Good-night! No dreams. Blest Emperor, no bad dreams! (They all disappear with their torches. Marcia &amp; Eclectus stand together in the night.) MARCIA. The fair-crowned train, the jugglers, the musicians, His court of beauty, how it passes careless From dread allegiance into night again. His pleasures flow away and his life's fashion Seeks its eclipse and quits him. Is my breath Destruction? Ah, I grow too terrible In judgment. God and Time alone should sweep Existence to the void, a man's past days And those he has provided for. The deed We wait to do is tamer sacrilege Than this we have accomplishedâto enforce That trooping off of strength and gaiety And shame and all he loves: the rest is compassed By undiverted purpose. ECLECTUS. Cling to that. MARCIA. 'Tis not from you, I must not learn from you What shall sustain the hour. Be still, or speak Of Laetus and his peril, of Narcissus You won to stay and aid us. But be still. I think it is enough to hear the sky: Its darkness sounds and does not start the brain, Nor set it wincing. (She gazes up, her hand against her lips.) Ha, upon my finger A touch of honey! I can taste it, clean, Sweet honey from the cup I have just mixed. Honey! You must not listen. Every word You let me utter is a throe, a weakness. Where's Laetus? Are you weeping? (She pulls his robe from Eclectus' face.) ECLECTUS. No, the stars Are gone, that's all; the pure, white way of stars. Can you not let me be! Why should we trouble To ask each other questions, while the heavens Are baffling us with sorrow. Come within. MARCIA. (Restraining him.) Not there: You must not pass. (Eclectus turns back into the shadow, remains motionless &amp; again covers his face.) I am deserted, Left with these murder-hands he cannot touch. But yet, if I desist, we join the shadows That flaunt across the void. Why should I fear To take another name of infamy? For him, for safety of that bowed, black head, I will be bold, I will bear anything, Even his eyes when afterward . . . (Enter Laetus, followed by Pylades.) O Laetus! Good Laetus comes, alert to save himself. Here's courage, here's the aptitude! (Motioning to Laetus.) To me! I thank you for your promptness. LAETUS. What is done? How would you meet this sudden treachery? MARCIA. We have command of the whole house. Go forward! We must not linger. You shall hear our purpose; It lies as clear before me as a vision I have but to obey. ECLECTUS. (Suddenly turning to Laetus.) The chamberlain Must lead you to his bed. MARCIA. You keep your office, You cling to duty as it were a chain: You cannot know all things are in their season Most holy, incorrupt. ECLECTUS. Give me the torch. Marcia, there is no haste; we could confer, For if his sleep have changed him . . . MARCIA. Nothing changes Nor sleep, nor death, nor passing of the years. (She beckons them to enter before her.) (Turning, she faces the night.) One breath of darkness, there! I have no need Of the approving stars. I drink the night's cool force, while life and death Are moving far beneath me. Oh, this air! (She goes in.) PYLADES. What is it she invokes? They pass within; They are all there, and I am left without, A pantomime before cloaked Thanatos. O horrible! And, oh, most false! Tricked in these gauds as Paris, I am a pantomime. But there, to him, Beneath his godlike breathing, I was simply The lad, the flower. I did not dance to him; Unmasked and moving up and down the room I served him and he rested in my motions, My patron and my god. What have I done? I am not Hyacinthus any more, Nor any more beloved. What have I done? I have betrayed him, and it is my blow; From me, his Philocommodus, he falls. . . . Oh, I am winter-cold! It was not thus I felt in acting, never thus. My patron! I hate that they should lay him in the dust, Choke the warm voice for ever. No more praise, No godlike dances, no more make-believe That there are heroes in our midst, no gods: There, thereâand all the garlands dropping off! (Exit within.) (The darkness has now become complete. For a long interval a soundless hush. Then a single slave with a horn-lantern comes out, followed by Narcissus, &amp; slaves bearing furniture &amp; rolls of carpet from the palace on the right. Pylades follows them. They disappear &amp; the track of the lantern is lost. Again it is dark night. Gradually the burthen of the darkness is lifted, &amp; through thinning obscurity voices are heard.) FIRST VOICE. He has departed where he would. 'Tis time To follow down the cliff. Come, chamberlain, You must arouse our Emperor from his sleep, True to your officeâha! (Laughter is heard.) A second fall! Cling to the rock, and caution! VOICE. (Within.) Pylades! SECOND VOICE. I cannot thread this darkness, and beside, You hear, she calls us. FIRST VOICE. Leave the concubine; Rome calls. You have the tablet in your bosom? Coming at such an hour . . . VOICE. (Within.) Stay, Pylades, I cannot be alone, you must not leave me. Narcissus, Pylades! FIRST VOICE. Ho, ho! I say, Coming at such an hour, he well may think . . . Where are you groping to? SECOND VOICE. The light has stirred Behind that cloud. I would not look at it Unless I have a patron I can serve In the unknown wastes of Time. FIRST VOICE. But dawn is come. Hail the New Year. SECOND VOICE. No, straight to Pertinax. (There is unbroken silence; gradually the greyness becomes lighter, the columns loom, &amp; through them the city appears softly wreathed by fillets of mist. Marcia comes from the Palace &amp; moves to the extreme verge of the terrace.) MARCIA. They should not all have left me in the darkness, As though I had no purpose any more. I grow a ghost and as a ghost most restless To mingle with the living. In the room They left me with his gladiator's masque, And all his rich array. I tried to call them; I could not, for there were so many names, And one I must not utter. Pylades Wept when he helped to muffle him. I think That I was glad to see him weep; my heart Was beating like a little shaken dust Because he had no mourner. All the slaves Shrank back, but one took up the poison-bowl, And washed it clean and put it in its place . . . It was his favourite bowl. Come back to me, Eclectus, come! But I must recollect That he will visit Pertinax, the palace Must not be empty; all the little round Of rule and riot must begin again. So great is my accomplishing, almost It seems as there were nothing more to do, And I would journey very far away. Ah, but my lover would not! Men so cling To circumstance, when a great deed is wrought, They creep about it and with gradual change Add to it and destroy. But nothing matters That may befall me now, if I may hear My name set in his voice, no other word, My name, and a great fondness. (Re-enter Narcissus.) You return? You shall not haunt the palace. And your hands. It chokes my breath to see them. NARCISSUS. He is laid Among our own, among the athletes, proud He should be of his burial. MARCIA. He strove: You did not kill at once. NARCISSUS. I struck him down Before your eyes and in their lustre. MARCIA. Hence, And hide your face! NARCISSUS. (Pointing down the valley.) Why, do you stare so hard Over our field, our portion? Hecate, Would you dwell near the murdered blood! MARCIA. There, there, Within that fort. . . . I must look down on itâ There, when they roll the heavy carpets out, He will be found. His visage always faded To half-obliteration when he slept. He will be found, the golden curls pressed flat, The gilded dust spilt in the weft and woof Of the heavy wrappings. How he looked at me! What glazed, disconsolate and patient eyes He lifted as he drank the poison-cup! And then your hands. . . . O Christ, be pitiful! NARCISSUS. Do you invoke your God? He was the victim Of Roman soldiers: step by step they slew. MARCIA. The darkness of that Majesty! Begone! (Exit Narcissus.) O Christ, belovÃ¨d, if I might have taken Thy body from the cross and washed it clean And wrapped it in pure linen, I am made For such low offices and so I love. Jesu, I do not know Thee any more After thy burial: but thy blood, thy shame, Thou meek, unutterable God! I worship, I never can forsake Thee. Was the valley Like that, and then the little hill? How wide The dawn of the New Year, how wide the light! (Re-enter Eclectus.) ECLECTUS. Marcia! MARCIA. BelovÃ¨d! ECLECTUS. Oh, I thought you worshipped. I would not come between. MARCIA. You beckoned me, You called me and to hail with you the light. ECLECTUS. O Erebus, I do not know your gods, Or what you worship: they are men, are outcasts, They never have been kings. MARCIA. I hail the light; I turn to Janus and his dozen altars, I turn to all his months, to all his years. I do not tremble in this magnitude Of sweetness: all I wrought was in the name Of the great darkness that brings forth the sun. ECLECTUS. I cannot argue. I have seen his bodyâ I have to tell you that; 'tis wrung from me By torture. They had dragged him with a hook. The Senators had kept him thus exposed As carrion on the air, but Pertinax Shed tears and bade that they should bury him As the good Emperor's son. And after that The streets grew quieter; a change was shed Over men's faces. I was born to serve: Marcia, and I will serve him to the end. MARCIA. Ay, the new Emperor? ECLECTUS. Will you murder meâ As you have murdered. . . . MARCIA. Yes, my Emperor, Mine on the coins for ever. He is gone. ECLECTUS. He writ our fates together on one scroll, And all his writing was a prophecy. (Seizing her hand.) Where shall we go? When last you took my hand You led me to his bed; but I have left him Couched yonder in the valley. MARCIA. He is gone. ECLECTUS. O Marcia, but you are a concubine: You have seen many passâ They pass before you as the leaves. My heart Was fixed on him. MARCIA. Would I were in the valley! ECLECTUS. With him? Ah, would we were! That is our place. We have no season in the coming time, And Janus close the past! MARCIA. Nay, we were lovers In that old time. ECLECTUS. Then Janus close the past. (He strikes his forehead on their clasped hands.) THE END</field>
