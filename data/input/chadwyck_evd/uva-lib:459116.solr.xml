      <field name="fulltext">The Illustration. This faithlesse woman, by her friends consent Plighted her troth to Bateman! streight not c?tent With his revenue! Coveting for more Shee marries German for his wealthy store There Parents iarr'd, and never could agree Till both of them were dround in misery. Young Bateman hangs himselfe, for love of her: Shee drownds her selfe (guilt plaies the murtherer.) His Ghost afrights her, sad thoughts doe her annoy (Alive or dead: tis shee, he must enjoy.) The Morrall is Maides should beware in choise, And where they cannot love, divert their voice. Parents must not be rash, nor too vnkind, And not for wealth to thwart, their Childrens minde. All is not gaind, that's got, (ill purchasde wealth, Never brought comfort, tranquill, pence, and health) This president, this principle doth allow Weddings are made in Heaven, though seald below.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue to Censurers. Truth saies the Author, this Time will be bold To tell a Story, truer ne're was told. Wherein he boldly vouches all is true That this Time's spoke by vs, or heard by you. If Chronicle, that ever yet gain'd favour May please true Iudgments: his true endeavour From serious houres his gaind it: for vs He hopes our labours will be prosperous. And yet me thinkes I here some Criticke say That they are much abus'd in this our Play. Their Magistracy laught at! as if now What Ninty yeeres since dy'd, a fresh did grow: To those wee answer, that ere they were borne, The story that we glaunse at, then was worne And held authentick: and the men wee name Grounded in Honours Prowesse, Vertues Fame. Bring not the Author then, in your mislikes, If on the Ages vice, quaintly he strikes And hits your guilt! most plainely it appeares He like a Taylor that hath lost his sheares Amongst his shreds, he knockes upon the board, And by the sound themselues they doe affoord. If in his scenes, he any vice have hit To you farre better knowne then to his wit, Tak't to your selves alone: for him, his Penn Strikes at the vices, and not mindes the men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scena Prima. Enter young Bateman meeting Anne. Anne. My Bateman. Y. Ba. My sweetest Nan? An. Had I but one entire affected Pearle Inestimable unto vulgar censure And is there none to play the Theife but thou! Oh misery would'st have thy love entrans'd, Without an eccho that would sigh farewell. Common curtesie 'mongst rurall Hyndes With this formallity disciplines them (Kisse at the departure), and you to steale away Without my Privity? Y. Ba. Pray thee no more? Teares are the Heralds to future sorrowes, I have collected all that's man together And wrastld with affections as with streames, And as they strive that doe oppresse the billowes So doe I fare in each externall part. My Actes are like the motionall gymmalls Fixt in a VVatch, who winde themselves away Without cessation; here if I stay, I finde, I must be where thou art! which when I am Thy fathers rage encreases like a flame Fedd by ungentle blastes! my absence May worke those bitter sweeteings from his hart And smooth the rising furrowes in his brow. It is sufficient that I know thee firme. Fixt as a Rocke in constancy, and love, Able to ship-wracke greatnes, and despiseth A violated heart, as a disease. I goe to Leith as children goe to schoole Studying what shall please my Mistris best, My lesson cond , I will returne againe And dedicate my labours unto thee. An. Sweete doe not goe; and yet if that you will Leaving me here like a forsaken Lover, Prethee forget, me not; nay be not angry Souldiers in Warre make any saint their owne Forgeting those they are devoted too! Tis I have vow'd to have thee quicke or dead, Flattering honours, nor dissembling beauties Workes me not from thee. Y. Bat. Sweare not sweete Nan! The booke of fate, as now may be unclasp'd And record what thou speak'st. An. Be it writ in brasse My love shall be as durable as that! Now by this kisse, nay I will second that, When I this hand bequeath to any one But my sweete Bateman; then may I ever From heaven, and goodnes rest a cast-away, If e're I. give this hand, to any one But my sweete Bateman. Y. Bat. Thy constancy I resalute. Death onely separates me from thy love. Alive or dead I shall enjoy thee then Spite of thy fathers frownes. Enter Vrsula. Vrs. Why then up-with your bag, and baggage, and to Saint Maries presently the Priest stayes, the Clarke whynes to say Amen! and for th'official schollers love butterd loaves, an Angell will perswade him to consent, we that live by the sinnes of the people may dispense with veniall toyes. Y. Bat. Thou art merry still. Vrs. Faith, and shalbe as long as I keepe me out of Cupids mannacles, doost heare Lover? take her now thou hast her i'th vaine trust not we wenches, theirs asmuch truth in us, as in Knightes o'th post, if she sweare love to day, shee'le unsweare it to morrow with a safe conscience; stand not shall I shall I, take me her to have, and to hold, and if eyther of you repent your bargaine within a twelue-monthâ An. What then! Vrs. Then you shall fetch no Bacon at Dunmowe; we young wenches in our loves are like Lapwinges, if once we creepe out o'th shells, we run from our ould loves like Scopperells, weomens minds are planetary, and amble as fast as Virginalls Iackes, if you stop 'em not in true time, you marre all your musique. See heres your Fathers. Enter ould Boote old Bateman. Y. Ba. Alas what wilt thou doe. An. Not shrinke a jot for thee. Bo. I charge thee on my blessing leave that boy. An. Father! sir. Bo.

Still are your eyes gadding that way, know this I'le sooner marry thee unto some slave Whom mine owne will can subordinate Rather then to him. Y. Ba. Is vertue growne to so absurd a rate It gaines no better credit with base wordlings. O. Ba. Tell me Boote. Does not his birth, and breeding equall hers, Are not my revenues correspondent To equall thine; his purity of bloud Runs in as sweete a streame, and naturall heate As thine, or hers; his exteriour parts May parralell hers, or any others In a true harmony of lawfull love. Wast not thine owne motion, didst not give way, And entercourse to their privacies? Didst thou not make me draw conveighances Did not th'assurance of thy Lands seeme proball, Boote, Boote thou shall not carry it thus I'le make thee know theirs justice to be had If thou denyst it. Bo. Say I grant all this! With my selfe having deliberated I doe not like 'thassurance of thy Lands Thy titles are so bangld with thy debts, Which thou wouldst have my daughters portion pay. Sir sir, it shall not! O. Ba. hang thee hang thee miser! Tis thy base thoughts forges these false conceits, And but for thy daughter, I'de, i'de, i'de. Bo. I'de come, come. An. Father? Y. Ba.

Art thou so built on her fidelity Take heede boy, women by kinde are fickle, Absence in lovers brings strange events Lovers that hourely kisse finde due regard But those that absent are oft lose reward.

An. Thou art pleasant still. In nat'rall things we see that Herbes, and Plants In autumne ever doe receive perfection, As they, so man, never attaines his height Till in the autumne of his growing age Experience like a Mistris beautifies him, With silver haires, badges of experience. Of wisdome, honours, counsell, knowledge, arts, With all th'endowmens vertue hath in store. Contrarily greene headed youth Being in the spring or summer of his age, Is prone to surfets, riots, intemperancies, And all the stocke of ills that vice is queene of; Urs. Thou wrests a good text to an ill sense? but none but fooles would ly in beds of snow that might couch in Roses? but it may bee Cozen; but it may bee Cuz? you follow the fashion of our Country Knights that marry your old London Widowes; tis but keeping a handsome Chamber-maide, they are necessary evills, and will serve with a small Dowery afterwards to make parsons wives! you know my meaning Cuz.

Cupid blesse thee, for i'le sweare, he has blinded thee as blind as a Bat. An. I lov'd young Bateman in my childish daies, Have vow'd to have him, and he againe to me, But what of that, foolish lovers vowes Like breath on steele, as soone are of, as on, German is wealthy and by him I gaine Recourse amongst the modest sagest dames? Wealth has a priviledge that beauty cannot, Bateman is young, embellish'd with a naturall, Active, and generous, unspotted beauty, German is old, indebted much to age, Yet like ould Ãson, gold can make him young, Gold like a second nature can elixate, Make the deformed faire, the faire seeme fowle, And we that love not, must be tide to th'face, A sparkling eye, or a smooth pleading tongue Will not keepe hospitality with time. Maides that love young men gaine their loves by stealth, We that love old men, wed not man but wealth? Vrs. If I beleeve thee not; may I turne Nun before my probation? to be serious let me touch thy conscience? if young Bateman to whom I know tha'st vow'd thy faith? should at thy falsehood fall into some malevolencies in himselfe, or on thee; t'wood greive thee to have Ballads made on thee, to the tune of the inconstant Lover, and have thy periuries pind on euery Post? An. Conscience, pray no more o'nt? Vrs. No introth for I thinke tha'st asmuch pleasure in't? as a hangd man has of his pardon, or a Dog with a Glasse bottle at's taile? see heres thy father, with him the man that must be, not the fore-man o'th Parish, but a bucke o'th first head. Enter Boote, Germane An. My lovely Germane? Ger. My fairest Mistris? Vrs. If I had not rather Kisse a muffe made of Cats-skins, then these mouldy chops of his, wood I might die an Anchoresse. Bo. Now neece whats your conceit of this? Vrs. Faith Vncle i'me a woman? and they say a woman is a wether-Cocke for mine owne part some are I thinke? and when I thinke they are not i'le tell you my conceit, till then i'le pay you with thinking. Ger. Sweet beauty, rumor, that betters nothing, But disproportionates every act, Gives it out thus; that you are affianc'd To youthfull Bateman? I wood not have the curse Of contract breaking fall upon my head, (If it be so, fairely I here acquit you, From all engagements twixt your selfe, and me) If not, like to a blessing I embrace you. That joynture which your father most desir'de I have confirm'd, nothing now remaines, But your reply, or mine, or whose you please? An. Sir I am yours? I lov'de young Bateman with an inward joy Affected him beyond a common rate, Yet not so farr, but that I might reduce My vowes, and my affections to my will, For when I saw how disproportionable Our jarring fathers were! I then began To alienate all love; here I renue To whom it comes as free, as bright, and pure As are these unstaind Lampes beyond the Moone. Ger. Which as a blessing from the heavens I take. Bo. You shall be marryed instantly! and Girle thou shalt have one Bagg more for this, it gladdes me yet, thou art so free from Bateman. I look'd for other demonstrations! come German this night wee'le feast, to morrow thou shalt be wedd, At night enfold a maiden in thy bed. Vrs. Which if he does, may she dy of the pip, and goe to the grave as a Sallet for the wormes. Exeunt Omnes.</field>

Strengthen me you ever Hallowed Powers, Guard me with patience that I may not curse, Because I lov'd her; be assured this, Alive or dead thy promise thou shall keepe I must, and will enjoy thee? An. And may I tell you if youle stay my husbands Funerall. I'le promise you i'le mourne, and marry all in a month. Y. ba.

I have not curs'd thee yet, remember that; And when th'ast staind thy innocent sheetes with lust, And with saciety fild thy empty veines, Weari'd the night with wanton dalliances, More prime then Goates, or Monkeys in their prides; Call then to minde how pleasant this had bene Had it not bene adulterate; for German (Is not thy husband; tis Bateman is the best. I have not curs'd thee yet remember that) I'le muster up the forces of a man, To quench the rising flames that harbor here And if I can forget thee by my hopes I will And never curse the Auth'resse of my ill.

Young Bateman ins shirt, a halter about his necke. Y. Ba. It tis resolv'd! life is too burthensome, I've borne while I can, and have supprest All insurrections pale Death has made. It is my terrour that I live to thinke I beare a life that is offensive to me. Pale monster in thy meagerest aspect Come, and affront me; fill thy unpauncht nerves With my harts bloud; till with the overture Thy never satisfied maw be sated? But cowardly monster thou approchest none But those that fly thee, and like to greatnes Wouldst be so elivated for doing good, That of thy selfe thou never didst intend. Poore Snakes that are in worldly sorrowes sowrst Cannot participate thy Ebon Dart. Tis said thou art not partiall, and dost winde The Prince, the begger, and the potentate All in one mould; but they doe falsifie That say thou art so tiranously just, For I have sought thee through the unpend groves, The shady cells where melancholly walkes, And eccho-like thou answerst me with Death, But darst not show thy face; the worlds monarch In three fits of an Ague di'd. Some flyes, Some silly gnats can kill! let me consume then maist thou brag thy conquest, that thou slewst What neyther love nor hatred could destroy. Since thou disdainst me, I disdaine thy power, There be a thousand waies to cozen Death Behold a Tree just at her doore a fruitlesse Tree That has in autumne cast her leavy boughs Sorry to show such fruit as she produces. The night seemes silent, sleepe charmes the house, And now the periurd woman is a topping, I'le clime as high as she, yet i'le not rest, My airy ghoast shall find her where she lyes, And to her face divulge her perjuries. Night be auspicious, draw thy sable weedes, For day-light is a asham'd of her blacke deeds One twich will do't, and then I shall be wed As firme unto my grave, as to her bed. Falls, hangs, Enter old Bateman ins shirt, &amp; Torch. O. Ba. I've miss'd my boy out of his bed to night Heavens grant that he be well, for in his eyes Sad discontentment sits! till yesterday I never saw him so propense to sorrow. Nor deepely touch'd with distemperature, When I began to tell him of his mistris Which I in violence of wordes branded With damned perjury; as Heaven knowes She has consum'd her goodnes; then would he Sit by, and sigh, and with salt teares trilling Downe his cheekes, entreat me not to name her, Curse her I must not! then would he steale to bed, As full of mournfull sorrowes as a sinner. Tis almost morne and I suspect him here Hovering about this house! oft would he say He woo'd her underneath a Plume-Tree, And underneath that Tree he vow'd to sit, And tell his sorrowes to the gummy boughes Though she disdaind to here them? protect me! Good Angells guard me, what heavy sight is this That like a sullen sadnes reaves my sense, Prove false mine eies that this may prove untrue? Better you never had seene then to see this. Leave your slimy cesternes, and drop out; Tis he, tis he, would I could tell a ly The falsest one that e're was tould by man That this might prove untrue; but tis in vaine To darke the Sunne, or wrastle 'gainst the truth. Murtherers looke out, i'le rowze the thunderer, To rowze you from your sleepes! false feinds come out, And see a deede, the day wilbe asham'd of Caus'd by your perjuries. Bo. Whoes that which calls Boote, Anne, Vrsula, above. With horrid terrour, and such affrightments As when skath fires devast our vilages, O. Ba. Looke this way monster see thou adultresse Behold the miserablest Map of woe That ever father mourn'd for; my poore boy Hard-harted fate that brought thee to this end, Hated Vipers they that were the causers, Bo. How darst thou Bateman come upon my ground O. Ba. Curs'd be thy ground, and curs'd be all trees That brings forth such a bortive fruit as this. Bo. Ha, ha, hasâhe hang'd himselfe, and sav'd justice a labor! An. I never look'd for better end of him, he had a malevolent aspect in his lookes, ha, ha, ha! O. Ba. Laughst thou Crocadile? Are miseries lamented with contempts? The bookes of fate are not so closely shut, But they may open, and record the scornes Dwelling in every Region of thy face? A fixt decree may be set downe for thine, And thou maist Swan-like sing a Funerall O'de, Who then shall laugh at thee? Bo. I laugh to see, how well sorrow becomes thee. O. Ba. Such dire becomings maist thou never want, Thou that wert once the Jewell of these eies, Looke here, and see the ruines of pale death. How soone a Gorgeous Pallace is suncke downe; Though he has surfetted upon this peece He has not tane the colour of his cheeke, Nature contests with death, and will out-doe him; Canst not thou spare one teare to balme him in, Nor lend a sigh as sorry for his fall? If not to day i'le come againe to morrow, So thou wilt shed two teares, and one poore sigh, Then gentle Charon will assigne him wafftage; Thy greifes are violent, and worke within Tis a fowle signe of an unpersant hart When as the eyes cannot impart a teare. Since none of you will weepe, i'le weepe alone Till Niobe like my teares convert to stone. An. Had you disciplind your sonne in's youth You might then have prevented your teares? Cause he was bad, and I did shun his evils, Must I be held the cause'res of his ils? Must my vertues beget his perversnes, Or my obedience breede his shamefull death, If the World ballance me uprightly just I care not then which way you turne the Scales; O. Ba. Worse then the worst that ever could be nam'd. An. My best counsell is that you bury him as the custome of the Country is, and drive a stacke through him; so perhaps I that had no quietnes with him whil'st he liv'd, may sleepe in peace now he's dead. O. Bat. I will not curse thee, t'was my boyes request Such deedes as these sinke not in oblivion, The justnes of my cause I leave to Heaven. Maist thou live mother of many children, And may they prosper better then did mine. Come poore boy these armes have borne thee oft I'le have thy picture hung up in my Chamber, And when I want thee, I will weepe to that Deaths Leaden Plummets draw thine eielids downe, Since none will sing sadd obsequies but I, I'le call the Linnet, Red-brest, and the Throsle, The Nightingale shall beare the burthen two For she is exquisite in tragicke notes, Weele have a Funerall hymne, and o're thy herse, This womans perjuiries i'le pen in verse. Enter An. How now cozen weeping? Vrs. Troth Cozen, Though griefes of lower kinds assaile me not, I never was so touch'd unto the hart, Mine eies so flexible are to melt in teares I cannot stop 'em; I shall be still affraid To walke to'th doore when I behold this Tree, For feare his Ghost haunte me! I wonder much, You could forbeare from passionating. An. Affraid on's Ghost, as much as of a picture painted o'th wall! thats just like we fooles that rub our shins 'gainst the bed posts in our dreames, and then sweare the faries, pinchd us? he swore he would have me quicke or dead. Let him ly still in's grave I will in my bed, and let consequents prove the rest? Bo. Ghosts Hobgoblins, Will with wispe, or Dicke a Tues-day. Thy husband wench this morne journyes to New-Castle And hardly will returne these twelve Moones, Let's feast with him, for Ghosts, and such like toyes Leave them to foolish dotards, girles, and boyes.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius Scena Prima. Enter, Anne hastily, pursuing Vrsula, with lights. An. Keepe of, keepe backe, I charge thee. Vrs. Las Cozen i'me not infectious my breath cannot blast you? An. It haunts me as my shaddow or a vision? It will not let me rest sleepe, nor eat, The barricoded doores and iron locks. No sooner shut but like a new clasp'd booke Their leavy hindges streightway fall asunder, And it gets in; I wonder tis not here, This is a gentle respit, and not usuall, Since German went I never had so much; It plaies the centinnell at my beds feete? And but it wants the rosie coloured face Whom meager death has plaid the Horse-Leech with, It would not seeme so ghostly in these eies, It beares the perfect forme it us'd to doe. As if it never knew immortality Nor wasted underneath a Hill of Clay. Sometimes as curious limners have pourtraid Teares trilling from the weeping Niobe, That some would sweare the very picture wept, And art of nature got the mastery? So did I guesse affluxe of brinish teares Came from this Aiery, and unfadom'd Ghost? And could the Painters of this age draw sighes I could demonstrate sighes, and heavy groanes As if a sensible hart had broke in twaine? Then would it turne, and cry false woman. And leave me to descant on the rest! Vrs. You tell me of an object, and a strange one, But whose is the resemblance? An. I theirs the point, For that I must be pardon'd; oh my shame That I should be the cause'res of a deed, I blush to nominate. Vrs. Has it no name! An. Yes sweete Vrsula, But such a one as sadly agrauates My woes in repetition; pray leave me I am addicted to contemplation But rest within my call. Vrs. Tis but your fond conceit; I've heard you say that dreames and visions were fabulous; and yet one time I dream't fowle water ran through the floore, and the next day the house was on fire; you us'd to say Hobgoblins, Fairies, and the like were nothing but our owne affrightments, and ye oh my troth Cuz I once dream'd of a young batchelour, and was ridd with a Night-Mare. But come, so my conscience be cleere I never care how fowle my dreames are. Exit. An. Thou now hast touch'd the point, Tis conscience is the Larum Bell indeede That makes us sensible of our good or bad? You that are Lovers, by me you may perceive What is the burden of a troubled minde, Take heede of vowes, and protestations Which wantonly in dalliancies you make, The eie of Heaven is on you, and your oaths Are registred; which if you breake, blesse me. Enter Ghost. Gho. Thou can'st not fly me, There is no Cavern in the Earth's, vast entrailes But I can through as pearcant as the light, And finde thee, though thou wer't entomb'd in stone, Thou can'st not catch my unsubstantiall part, For I am aire, and am not to be touch'd. From flameing fires of burning Phlegeton, I have a time limited to walke, Vntill the morning Cocke shall summon me For to retire to misty Erebus. My pilgrimage has no cessation, Vntill I bring thee with me to the place Where Rhadamant, and sable Ãacus dwell Alive or dead, tis I that must enjoy thee, To tell the story where we spirits live Would plucke Vermilion from thy Rosie cheekes, And make them pale, as Snowy Apennines, And from thine eies draw liquid streames of teares More full of issue then a steepy Fountaine, Alive or dead I must, and will enjoy thee, Thinke on thy promise. An. Distraction like an Ague seizes me, I know not whether I see here, or speake, My intellectuall parts are frozen up At sight of thee, thou fiery Effigies Of my wrong'd Bateman. Enter Boote, Vrsula. Bo. What weeping againe? An. Doe you not see it? Bo. See! what? I see nothing but a Bird fly o're the house. Urs. Nor I, but a blinde Buzzard lookes as like her husband as may be. An. Are you blinde, or will you make your selves so? See! how like a dreadfull magistrate it standes, Still pointing at me the blacke offender; And like a cunning poysoner, will not kill me, But lets me linger on, for daies, and yeares. It stares, beckons, points, to the peece of Gold We brake betweene us; looke, looke there, here there! Bo. I see nothing, perceive nothing, feele nothing. Vrs. Nor I, no quicke thing, neyther cloath'd nor nak'd. Bo. No, no, no! you drancke Baulme, Burrage or Buglosse last night to bed-ward, that makes you thinke on your dreames this morning. An. But I will too't, hug, and embrace it. Gho. Thy time is not yet come; i'm now exild I may not touch thee while thou art with chil'd. Exit Ghost. An. you doe not heare it neyther? Bo. Whom should we heare? An. Young Batemans visage. In every limbe as perfect as he liv'd. Bo. If it be so, 'tis done by sorcery. The father has combined, with some witch, To vex thy quiet patience, and gaine credit, That he would haunt thee dead, as oft he said, Hell can put life into a senseles body, And raise it from the grave, and make it speake; Vse all the faculties alive it did, To worke the Devill's hellish stratagems! If I but finde he deales in exorcimes I'le make him burne to pacifie the Witch, But doe not beleive it girle. An. 'Tis vanish'd in an instant! I will not be too confident in my eies, Will you grant me leave to visit Bateman? Bo. Visit mine enemy? An. I have an inward sorrow bids me doe it, I did him wrong to gybe his miseries When as he bore the dead Corpes in his armes, My Genius tels me, I shall have no rest Till I have made contrition; Bo. But not to him. I'de rather live subiected to a Turke, Goe not my girle, i'le feast all thy senses, Thy pallat shall with viands be suppli'd, Thine eares with heavenly rapture live inspir'd, Thine eies with sportive action, and delight, Thou shalt have Musique to consume the day, And wast the night. An. Musique! harsh Ravens croake? Scritch-Owles shreile, the augurers of night, Are first companions for my mellancholy, I must goe see him; if this apparition Appeare not in his sight, my conjecture Shall judge it nothing, but my conscience That finds me guilty for my blacke offence; Exit. Bo. Follow her Neece, She beares a Plurisie of greifes about her, And much I feare the weakenes of her braine Should draw her to some ominous exigent! Would she had ne're, infring'd her vow to Bateman Or I had ne're knowne this wealthy German! If he prove harsh to her, i'le make him know, An inforc'd hate to vengeance is not slow. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Joshua, his Cat in a string, Miles, Ball. Bal. Nay sweete Jo. be persuaded. Io. Persuade me, I scorne to be persuaded? Ball thou'art Heathnish, for the offence is foule which thou would'st cloake, I'me not to be persuaded, I will doome the creature, and burne the cloake of her knavery; yet in sincerity I will doe nothing without good colour. Mil. Thy colours, Jo. were better bestowed on course waiting women Madam Makeroones that sell paintings, and stop holes with plaister of Paris. Ios. Miller, Miller, thou art not mealy mouth'd, those be the Heathen bables, the May-poles of time, and Pageants of vanity, but I will convince them of error, and scoure their pollutions away with the waters of my exhortations. Mi. Why should'st thou hang thy Cat? Ios. Thou art saucy, Miller, &amp; ought'st not to Cathechise me so, Bal. And it were but for Country sake. Mi. Sweete Jo. consider thy Cat is thy Countriman, Bal. Hang a poore Cat for killing a Mouse? Mi. Knowing the proverbe too, Cat after Kinde. Bal. As it is in the painted cloath too; when the Cat's away the Mouse will play. Ios. I, but as it is in the painted cloath, beware in time for too much patience, to Dog or Cat will breede too much offence. She did kill a Mouse, I but when? on the forbidden day, and therefore she must die on Munday. Mi. Then shall thy zeale be proclaim'd, for hanging thy Cat on Munday for killing a Mouse on Sunday. Ios. Miller thou art drunke in thy enormities, and art full of the cake of iniquity. Gray, Arguile, Clifton. Bal. Well, to thy execution we commit thee. Ios. Blessed be the instruments of silence; poore Pusse take it not ill that I must hang thee, by that meanes I free thee from bawling Mastifs, and snarling Currs; I have brought thee up of a whelpe, and now will have a care of thy end. Gr. A notable exhortation. Ties her. Clif. List to the sequell; Ios. When thou art dead, thou shalt not curse me, for my proceedings shall be legall; thou art at the barre of my mercy, and thus I ascend to judgment, as it is in the painted cloath. Gr. Harken the inditement. Ios. Tybert the Cat; as it is in the painted cloath, of the Bull, and Cocke, sometimes house-keeper, drudger or scourer to Marmaduke Ioshua, Limner alias painter-stainer, &amp; now the correcter or extirper of vermine, as Rats, Mice, and other waspish animalls; thou art here indited by thy deare Master Marmaduke Ioshua for breaking of the high-day; what sayst thou for thy selfe? guilty or not guilty? hah. Gr. Would she could mew non guilty. Ios. Know'st thou not, thou silly Cat, that thy brethren will not Kill the Calfe nor rost the Mutton nor boyle their flesh Pots on the high-day? was it not decree'd by our learned brother Abolt Cabbidge, Cobler of Amsterdam, that they should be held uncleane, and not worthy of the meanes that did it, and did not expect Cratchet Coole his proud flesh in the Leene for making insurrection on the high day? Clif. A point well watred. Ios. Did not Nadab the Sowe-gelder make a gaunt of his gelt for being cumbersome on the high-day? Ha thy silence argues guilt; hast thou not seene the whole conventicle of brothers, and sisters walke to St. Anns, and not so much as a fructifying Kisse on the highâ Gr. It seemes the elect Kisse weekely. Ios. And must thou kill a Mouse? oh thou wicked Cat; could'st not turne up the white of the eie for the poore creature? thou gluttonous Cat, thou art now arraigned, I adjudge thee to be hanged this munday, for killing a Mouse yesterday being the high-day. Offers to hang her. Gr. Stay, stay, a pardon, a pardon! Ios. I am hot in my zeale, and fiery in expedition, Clif. Wee'le talke with you hereafter. Ios. I was executing a point of justice, equity, and conscience. Gr. A pleasant Tragecomedy, the Cat being scap't, What Trumpets this? Enter Crosse. Cros. Monlucke, Bishop of Valens, Newly anchor'd in the haven of Inskeith, Desires safe convoy by your honours forces, From the red Brayes to Edenborough Castle, The rest on entervew he will impart. Such entertainment, as the warre affourds The Drum the Fiffe, the thundering Cannon, The shrill Trumpets, and all war-like Cymballs, Such Musiques as in warrs Souldiers measure Bestow on him; come he in warr or peace He shalbe welcome? Io. Oh that prophane surplesse, ho, ho, ho. Enter Monlucke attendant saluts. Mon. Mary, King Dolphins wife, Dowager of France And heire apparant to the Scottish Crowne, Hearing of devastations in her Lands, And the oppressions that her neighbour Princesse With rough hostility grindes her people, Me her Legat she sends to Edenburgh, To parley with her Mother the Queene Regent, And Article A peace twixt her deare sister, The Queene of England, and the Lords of Scotland. If our conditions may be made with honour, This is my message. Gr. Eyther for peace or warre. The Queene my Mistris now is arm'd for both, For like a vertuous Princesse, and a Mother O're us her loving subjects, and her sons, She knowing a Kings security rests, In the true love, and welfare of her people, Rais'd this hostility for to guard her selfe, Not to offend, but to defend her owne, Her Secretary Sicill now attends On the like Embasy for Edenburgh, Whither your selfe shall safely be convoy'de. Mon. You are honourable foe. Gr. Will the Queene, Lay by her nicety, rough fil'd phrase, And not articulate too much with England? For by the power of warr e're two suns rise Weele mount the walls of Leith, and sacrifize, Her guilded Towres, and her French insulters; In flames of fire; we vow to hazard lives, And honours in the enterprize. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Anne, with a Torch, Vrsula, Bateman, wailing his Picture. An. Softly, softly; fie on your creaking shooes, what noise they make; shut the Dores close, it does not here us a jot, looke well to the Darneicke Hangings, that it play not the Court Page with us. Vrs. Heer's not so much as a shaddow to affright us, for mine owne part neyther Incubus nor Sucubus can do't; I feare not what a quicke thing can doe, and I thinke y'ore dead things are too quiet to say any harme An. Yet all is cleere, no frightfull vision Nor Ghostly apparition hauntes me yet; Yonders thy father, good powres assist me, That I may gaine his patience to heare me, And I am hartily satisfied. O. Ba. Pigmalion doated on the peece he made, So doe not I upon thy pourtraiture. I doe but hang thy faire resemblance here To tell me of my immortality. How sensible young Cedars are o'th winde, When as the aged Oake affronts all stormes 'Tis death, and natures fault, for the Diamond, Of blooming youth, despise decaying age. He might have tane thee el'ce, and left thee boy. An. Whom talkes he too? my life Coz, he has a ghost too Yet I see nothing. Ba. How now Hyena; why earnst thou hyther? Com'st thou againe to gybe my miseries? Has thy maligneing harted father sent thee To scoffe my sorowes? keepe of I charge thee, Thou did'st bewitch my poore boy with a Kisse, Thy breath is sure infectious, and I feare Their's something in thee smells of sorcery. Stand at distance. An. Good sir, use patience, That in extremity is soveraigne Balme, Teares be my witnes I come to comfort you, Yet I see nothing. Ba. Teares? 'tis impossible. Marble will drop, and melt against the raine, And from the cragy Rocks, Fountainous Flouds Oft get inforced issues; but to gaine Relenting teares from thy obdurate harte 'Tis impossible, as to force Fire from snow Water from flint, say the Sun shall not shine, As well upon the beggers as the King, That is alike indifferent to all. Vrs. Good sir remember, Forgivenes is an Atribute of Heaven. She has a harty sorrow for her sinnes, And comes to make attonement, if you please. An. Still I nothing any where. Ba. Pray listen; Would not that Physitian be well hang'd That for his practise sake Kills his patient, And after pleades a sorrow to his freinds? She weepes, an evidence of a harty sorrow, My boy would not have seene her weepe thus long, But hee'd have minister'd comfort I my teares Playes the theife with mine eies too. An. Yet all is safe; sure it was but my dreames, Sir you had a son, blesse me 'tis here now. Enter Ghost. In the same figure that it us'd to be. Peace is more deare, and pretious unto me Then a nights rest, to a man turmoil'd in Law. My eies set heere un-mou'd, i'le gaze with thee, Vntill the windowes of my head drop out. But then my minde wilbe afflicted too. For what is unseene there, is visible here. Leade me, i'le follow; though to a desart, Or any uncouth place, worke thy vengeance, And doe not torture me alive; neyther. Gho. All things keepe their time! An. Let all times daughters which are daies, convert To one day, and bring me to my period, Ba. Whom converse she withall? Vrs. To her unseene fancies. An. See with eies of wonder! see! Ba. What should I see? An. Aske you what? why 'tis your son, Just as he di'd, looke, looke, there, here, there. Ba. Is this thy sorow, com'st thou to mocke me? An. Just heavens not I! see how it smiles on you, On me it hurles a dejected looke. Takes the Picture. Ba. Because I hang his Picture ne're my bed, Com'st thou to laugh me! out out, fond-ling noe! See thus I gaze on it; stroke his snowy hands, And prune the curled tresses of his locks, Which the Arts-man neatly has dishevell'd. Vrs. Good sir; have patience, her's is true sorow, And not derision. Stands betweene the Picture, &amp; Ghost. An. Another Ganimede! This eye, and yon'd, are one? this front, that lip. This cheeke, a litle ruddier showes then that; The very ashie palenes of his face, The mossie downe still growing on his chin, And so his Alablaster finger pointing To the bracelet, whereon the peece of gold We broke betweene us hangs. Ba. Certes shee's madd. An. Pray come hither, You shade this Picture from the pearsant Sun, And curtaine it, to keepe it from the dust, Why are you not as chary then of that? It lookes as it were could, alas poore Picture, Ba. Hee'rs but one Picture! An. I say theirs two, You will not see this for to save a Curtaine, His knotty curles, like to Apollo's tramells Neatly are display'd; I'le sweare the Painter That made this peece, had the other by it. Why doe you not speake too it? 'tis your son, May be, he's tongue-tide, and cannot crave blessing, Ba. I could tell thee, I nail'd him to the Earth Riveted a stake quite through his bosome, And bid thee goe seeke him; but I love not To mocke miseries; i'le take this Picture hence, It troubles your sight. An. And you'd remove that, I'de thanke you; Ba. 'Tis thy forc'd fancies, and thy guilt together persuades thee so; pray thee be a woman, Whom thou cam'st to comfort, comforts thee; Though I intended to have hurl'd at thee, Stings of dishonour, ignominies, reproaches, And all the stocke of calumnies, and scorne, Which thou art guilty off; now my pity Converts them into sorrow for thy sorrowes; Vrs. A blessing crowne you for it. An. And can their be a hope you will forgive me? Exit Ghost. Ba. Hartily I doeâ An. See i'ts gone now. As if it vex'd to see your clemency. Ba. Distemper not your selfe at fancies; Your time hastens to maturity, Y'are very big, and may endanger your fruite, If you give way to passions. An. T'will be abortiue, As are my actions, I shall not live To take felicity in it! see it's here againe. Enter Ghost, and Exit. Gho. All things keepe their time. Ba. Come goe with me. I'le give thee comfortable cordialls That shall remove these objects from thine eies, Expelling all disastrous accidents, And plaine thy thoughts as smooth as innocence, Which when thou hear'st, then in rapture boast, Thou dread'st no vision, fury, feind nor Ghost. Exeunt Omnes. An. Be you my counsellour, and father too, Vrs. Whom I admire for noble honesty.</field>

How goes the day, sir Jaruis? Clif. Ti's bloudy. The thunderer, on both sides shootes his boults Valour is at the touch-stone of true tryall; The French like to so many gods of warre Bravely brandish darting sire from steele; The valiant Scot Arguile commandes the Hill, The Towne-playes fercely; their came a shot Of full two hundreth weight into my Tent. Doysells has thrice assaulted me. I fac'd him, And from his sides, like Libian Hercules, I tore the rough Nemean Lion's Skin His Armour of good proofe which here I beare, And will not part from, but with losse of life. Gr. See!

Like angery Lions, or incenced Tygers; The Frenchmen labour, greedy for the prey, Now the hardy Scots as swift as Roes, Climbe the walls, and tosse the Frenchmen downe, Now from the mount their thundring Cannons roare, Whose direfull clangors shake their huge structures, And like an earth-quake tumble to the Earth, Their steeples, Ordinance, Gunners, all at once, Now Inskeith, Sutton, Newport, Conway, Fitton, As dreadles enter dangers, as their Tents; Accursed chance, the Ladders are too short, Which gives a treble, vantage to the French.

No, no, Mistris Barren, an Infant smileing, and a Lambes bleateing is a signe of fertility it is so in Artimedorus; you frown'd when you were borne, and thats the reason you are so sterill; Artimedorus saith so in his fourth booke. Mag. What pretty dimples it has! Long. Fathers none nyes. Pra. None nose. Barr. Smooth fore-head! Mag. Cherry lip! Pra. Had it bene man-child, their had bene three evident signes of an whoremaster; a Roman Nose, Cherry Lip, and a bald Pate, for so Artimedorus in his Problems. Mag.

Enter Boote. Vrs. Here comes my Vncle. Pra. Off with your hat sir, you come not here without reverence, see if the little infidell smile not on him, busse, busse, it. Bo.

Good women whose helpes I had but now. 'Tis almost now of that necessity It was before: I pray be vigilant, For if you slumber, or shut your eie-lids, You never shall behold my living corps. Pra. Blesse us daughter say not so! I hope you will not part in a trance, nor steale away in a qualme; come, come what should be your reason? An. Nothing but a dreame. Pra. An't be a dreame, let me come too it; was it a sorrowfull dreame? Artimedorus saith there be divers kinde of meates engender dreames; as Beanes, long Peason Lentills, Cole-worts, Garlicke, Onions, and the like; Leekes, Ches-Nuts, and other opening Rootes, as Rad-dish, Carrets, Skirrets, Parsenips; now there is some flesh is provocative too; as the Hart, the Bore, the ould Hare, and Beefe; and then of fowles, as the Crane, Ducke, Drake, Goose, and Bustard; if you tasted any of these they will engender dreames. An. Pray marke me, and let my words be written Within your minds, as in a manuscript, That when it proves so, you may say I told it. Lon. Peace, and heare her dreame. An. Me thought I walk'd a long the verdant banks Of fertill Trent, at an un-usuall time, The winter quarter; when Herbes, and Flowers Natures choisest braveries are dead. When every saplesse Tree fad's at the roote; Yet then, though contrary to nature, Vpon those banks where foaming surges beate, I gatherd Flowers, Roses red, and Damaske, Love Pauncies, Pincks, and gentle Daffadils, That seldome budds before the Spring time comes, Daisies, Cowslopps, Harebells, Marigoulds, But not one bending Violet to be seene. My apron full I thought to passe away, And make a Garland of these fragrancies; Just as I turn'd, I spide a lovely person, Whose countenance was full of splendancy With such embellishings, as I may imagine Better then name them; it bad me follow it, Then me thought, it went upon the water, As firmely as on land; I covetous To parley with so sweet a frontis-peece Leap'd into th'water, and so dround my selfe. Pray watch me well this night; for if you sleepe. I shall goe gather Flowers, and then youle weepe Vrs. T'was a strange dreame! Pra. But a very true one; looke you Artimedorus in his third booke of his Moderns saith to dreame of Flowers is very good to a woman in child-bed; it argues she shall soone enjoy her husband, to walke on the Seas specifies to a man, delight, but to a woman a dissolute life, for the Sea is like a harlot, a glicery face, and a broken heart. Come, come, doe you sleepe? wee'le watch; by this good drinke; Gossip Mag-py, I was almost dry. An. Lay the babe by me that I may Kisse it; Pra. So, so, she sleepes, come sit round, and lets have a Carrouse to the litle infidell. Vrs. I marry sir this is a silent houre, their teeth will not let their tongues wag. Well drunck Mother mid-night, now will she sweare by this Wine, till she soke the Pot were it a fathome deepe. Pra. By this good liquor, it is so. Vrs. Here's sweete swearing, and deepe vowes, she goes to'th bottome at every oath. Mag. And I'faith Gossip Long-tongue when peipes the Onion out o'th parsley-bed, when shalls come to your feast? Lon. Truely Gossip Mag-py when Caster, and Bollux raignes. Vrs. Sweete Mother Pratle what be those Castor, and Bollux? Pra. Twinns daughter that rule most the signe being in Virgo, looke you Gossip Barren could you once dreame of sore eies you should be sure of children? Barr. Good sooth Mother Pratle, the first time I dream'd, I was with child I got a husband presently. Pra. By this dyet-bread Artimedorus saith so; marke Mistris Vrsula, to dreame to have Lyce, eyther in head or body, in some quantity signifies a proper man well appointed; and by this drinke I dream'd my husband when he came first a woing; came i'th liknes of a Kentish twindle Pippen; that is just, as if two stones grew together, no sooner was I married, but I had two sonnes presently just as Artimedorus saith by this diet-bread. Vrs. They have sworne all the VVine, and Banquet away. Barr. I know not what your twindles are, but i'me sure I tender Castor, and Bollux as dearely as any of you; I cannot dreame, heighoâ Pra. You begin to be sleepy; I can prescribe you a medicine of Poppy, Mandragora, and other drowsy Sirrops; heida all a sleepe? if my charge sleepes, let me rest, for by this drinke i'me heavy tooâ All sleepes. Vrs. Their all asleepe I have a heavy slough, Come o're my eie-lids; Somisdore hath strucke me, I cannot wake, and must give way to rest, Sleepe. Enter Ghost. Gh. Deaths eldest daughter sleepe with silencies Has charm'd yond beldams, no jarring clocke Nor murmuring winde dares oppose just fate. Awake fond mortall ne're to sleepe againe, Now is the time I come to claime my promise, Alive or dead I must, and will enjoy thee. An. Blesse me I was in my dreame againe; ha! Mothers, Cozens, Mid-wife, all drown'd in sleepe? Then my decreed houre is here set downe I must away? Gh. With expedition; The Ferry-man attends thee at the verge Of Cocitus, and sooty Acheron, And he shall waft thee into Tartary, Where perjury, and false-hood finds reward There shalt thou reade thy history of faults, And mong'st the furies finde just recompence, I'le bring thee over Turrets, Towres, and Steeples, O're shady Groves, brineish Mears, and Brookes, The flattring Sea to me is navigable, O're steepy Mountaines; and the craggy Rocks, Whose heights Kisse Starres, and stop the flying Clouds Wee'le through as swift as Swallowes in recourse. The Chauntecleere summons my retreat, Signing a period to my pilgrimage; From nipping frosts, and penetrating blastes Could Snowes, blacke thawes, and misty killing deawes. I'le lead thee to the ever-flaming Furnace, That like a Feaver fed by opposite meates, Engenders, and consumes it selfe with heate. I'le peirce the Aire as with a thunder bolt, And make thy passage free; make speede away Thy broken contract, now thou goest to pay. Enter. Shee leaving her bed. An. Oh helpe, succour: helpe! wives, cozens, Mid-wives, Good Angels guard me, I goe, but cannot tell, Whether my journey be, to Heaven or hell. Vrs.

What meanes this noise! how comes my doores open at this time o'th night; I hope my daughters well, Vrs. Oh sir shee isâ Bo. Not dead I hope. Vrs. I know not that neyther; but whilst we After long watching tooke a litle rest She's stolne out of her bed, and fled away, The doores quite open, and the infant here. Enter Women bringing Anne. Bo. Heaven blesse her; I am strucke dead with griefe She has beene subject to distemper'd passions Jove grant she works no harme upon her selfe, Me thinkes she should not for the infants sake, Poore babe it smiles, it lacks no mother yet. Till it misse the brest, she cannot be farre But they may find her out; their's a great Snow Fal'ne this night, and by her foote stepps they may Easily trace her, where she is. Vrs. Oh misery! Behold the saddest spectacle of woe, That ever mortall eies tooke notice off. Pra. We trac'd her through the Snow, step, by step, Vntill we came unto the River side, Where like a cunning Hare she had indented To cozen her persuers, and cozen'd her selfe For dround we found her on the River side Nigh Collicke Ferry. Bo. Oh my poore girle! Enter Bateman with his Picture. Ba. Oh my poore boy! Bo. How happy had I beene if she had liv'd? Ba. How happy had I beene if he had liv'd? Bo. Whoes that which ecchoes me, playing the wanton With my miseries? Ba. I come to see how sorrow does become thee Doo'st thou remember that? Bo. What mak'st thou here, is there no other wracke, To worke my miseries higher, but thy selfe, And art thou come for that? oh my poore girle. Ba. Monster, behold my poore boyes Picture, Thou would'st not shed a teare, nor lend a sigh, Poore emblem of a penitentiall heart, When in these armes I hug'd my dead boyes corpes, Now monster, who i'st will weepe or sigh, for thine? Bo. Monster thou troublest me. Ba. Murderer I will. See what the fruites of wealth have brought thee now, An everlasting scandall to thy name. A conscience full of horror, and black deedes; Natures externall superfluities Her white, and red Earth, rubbidg, drosse, and oare, Which she but lent thee to keepe Marts withall, Thou hast converted to most grosse abuses, Thou wouldst not else have scorn'd my poore boys love, To match with wealthy German; see thy fruits, Thy bazes, and foundations now are suncke, And looke there lyes the ruines of thy workes. Bo. Oh misery! my hart-strings cracke with griefe, Yet will not burst, oh say, hast thou yet done? Ba. Noe, I will make thee sensible of thy ils, First thou art causer of thy daughters death, For thou enforc'd her to the breach of faith; Next my sonns ruin, whom parac'd like, Thou laugd'st at in his fatall tragedy; VVhom but a villaine that abjures all lawes, That breakes all precepts, both of heave'ns, and mans, And natures too could have done this; should I Like one that dares affront divinity Laugh at thy daughters fall. Bo. Hast thou done yet? I doe beseech thee for this infants sake, Which sets a smiling brow on miseries, And even by instinct, prayes thee to forgive, Commiserate my woes; it greives me now I did deri'd thy miseries; be but content I'le weepe till thou shalt say, it is enough, So that we may be friends. Ba. I cannot chuse. But beare a burden in calamities; Our angers have like tapers spent themselves, And onely lighted others, and not us. Striving like great men for supremacy VVe have confounded one anothers goodnes, Come we will be freinds, i'le dig a soleme cell, VVhich shall be hung with sables round about, VVhere we will sit, and write the tragedy Of our poore children; i'le ha'it so set downe As not one eye that vewes it, but shall weepe Nor any eare but sadly shall relent, For never was a story of more ruth, Then this of him, and her, yet nought but truth.

After the hand of warre has raz'd your walls, Affrighting peace from your Jvory beds, And like the reaper with his angry sickle Leaves the Earth full of soares, and wounds, Yet after plasters her with her owne crop; So come we after warre, bloudy turmoiles To bring you peace, which had you sued before, Thousands that now ly boweld in the earth Had liv'd to memory what we have done. Set ope your gates, &amp; with spred armes embrace her For which as followes yee have articulated, Mon. Which we, Monluck, Bishop of Valence Labrosse, Amyens joynt commissioners For the most christian King, and Queene, Francis, and Mary of France, and Scotland, Have Confirm'd. Mor., Doy. Which, we as duty bindes, must obey. Clif. The Articles thus followe, The most mighty Princesse Elizabeth by the grace of God, of England, France, and Ireland Queene, defendor of the faith, &amp;c and the most Christian King, Francis, and Mary, by the same grace King, and Queene of France, and Scotland have bore Record upon a reconciliation of peace, and amity to be inviolably kept betweene them, their subjects, Kingdomes, and confines; and therefore in their names it is straitly commanded to all manner of persons, borne under their obeysances, or being in their services, to lay by all hostility eyther by Sea or Land, and to keepe good peace eyther with other from this time forwards, as they will answer therto, at their utmost perils; long live Elizabeth, Francis, and Mary; Omn. Long live Elizabeth, &amp;c. Mor. We much desire to heare the Articles, On which this peace stands fully ratifi'd. Clif. They are thirteene in number; The principall, and of most effect, are these, That the French Souldiers, and all men of warre Leave the Realme of Scotland in twenty daies, Sixe score Souldiers, onely are excepted, Three score of them to remaine at Inskeith, And three score, at the Castle of Dun-barr, Their wages to be paid from the estates of Scotland; and to live lawfull subjects To the Lawes, and ordinances of that Realme, All fortifications in, or, about Leith, Which by the French was built, shalbe defaced, That France conveigh not any man of warre Nor ammunition into this Land, Without a free consent in Parliament, Of the three estates of these great Kingdomes. That Francis, and Mary King, and Queene of France, From henceforth beare not the Armes of England Which solely appertaine to our dread Mistris The Queene of England, and to no other. These as you hope for peace, you must observe. Mor. We subjects are the hands, Kings are the heads, And what the head commands, the hands must act, Our barrocadoed portalls shall flie ope, And yeild entrance; if war-like Clifton please, As we have fought together, so wee'le feast, Such viands, as a raized Towne can yeild You shall receive; noble sir Francis Leake Hath in this manner proclam'd this peace On the North-side whom we will gratulate Which tearmes of honour, will it please you enter? Clif.

Wee'le meete, like constant lovers, arme in armes. Bal. See, Joshua is enter'd, one cup of briske Orleance Makes him i'th temper he was when he leap'd into Leene. Cros. Will he be drunke? Bal. Most swine-like, and then by the vertue of his good liquor hee's able to convert any Brownisticall sister. Cros. An excellent quality! Bal. Nay, in that moode, you shall have him, instead of presenting Piramus, and Thisbe, personate Cato Censorious, and his three sons, onely in one thing he's out, one of Cato's sons hang'd himselfe, and that he refer's to a dumbe show; Cros. Me thinks he should hang himselfe for the jest sake. Bal. As he did his Cat for killing a Mouse on Sunday, see! he has top'd the cannikin already; now will he sing treason familiarly, being sober, aske him why he did it? in sincerity, it was not he, it was his drinke. Enter Joshua, reeling with Jacks. Ios. As it is in the painted cloath, in sincerity; good liquor quickens the spirit. When from the warrs I doe returne, And at a cup of good Ale mourne. I'le tell how Townes without fire we did burne, and is not that a wonder? Bal. That's more then the painted cloath! Ios. I'le tell how that my Generall, Enter'd the breach, and scal'd the wall, And made the formost battery of all, and is not that a wonder? Cros. Admirable! Ios. How that we went to take a Fort, And tooke it too in warr-like sort I'le sweare that a ly is a true report, and is not that a wonder? Cros. Ther's wonder in that, Jo! [Ios.] How that we Souldiers, had true pay, And cloath, and vit'les every day, And never a Captaine ran away, and is not that a wonder? Bal. Nay, and but sixe daies to'th weeke. Ios. Is there any man here desires to edyfie? I am in the humour of converting; I was converted in my drinke, and so are most of my bretheren; I'le stand while I am able, and then will goe sleepe on it.

They are my Lord in each particular, And the French ready to depart the Towne, By my Hollidam, they have feasted us. Not like to foes but friends, 'tis my wonder, That a beseiged Towne could yeild such Cates, In such extremities, and exigents, Full forty severall messes, yet not one, Eyther of fish or flesh, onely one dish, Which was the daintiest, (a powder'd horse) That, I tooke notice off. Gr. Large stomacks, and empty sallet dishes Are the French-mans viandes; his banquetings, Cloyes not the stomacke, but gives satiety, A fresh appetite; that makes the body Active, and full of generous fires, Full dishes are like potions unto them, I know not whether nicety or want; Clif. By my Hollidam; want, want, Give me the English chine, and that feedes men, And they that feede well, certainly will fight Vnlesse some Woolfe, or maw-Worme be internate; Arg. I relish your opinion.

Most abhominable! wood'st thou have a Puritan speake to a Play; a Puppet Play! thou ought'st to be burn'd for thy hereticall conceit, why thou poison'd sowter, wood'st thou have a Puritan speake to a Play? still give me the hobby-Horse. Bal. But who shall play the hobby-Horse, Master Major? Mi. I hope, I looke, as like a hobby-Horse as Master Major I have not liv'd to these yeares, but a man woo'd thinke I should be old enough, and wise enough, to play the hobby-Horse, as well as ever a Major on'em all; Bal. Not so, cholericke Miles. Mi. Let the Major play the hobby-Horse among his bretheren, and he will; I hope our Towne Ladds cannot want a hobby-Horse, have I practic'd my Reines my Carree'res, my Pranckers, my Ambles, my false Trotts, my smooth Ambles, and Canterbury Paces, and shall Master Major put me besides the hobby-Horse? Bal. Thou wilt not understand me Miles! Mi. I am an asse if I doe not; have I borrow'd the sore Horsebells his Plumes, and braveries, nay had his mane new shorne, and frizl'd, and shall the Major put me besides the hobby-Horse? let him hobby-Horse at home and he will! Bal. Thou art impatient. Mi. Woo'd it not make a man impatient; am I not going to buy ribbons, and toyes of sweet Vrsula for the Marian, and shall not I play the hobby-Horse? Bal. Why then, let the Major speake the Oration; Mi. Disgracefull, am not. I able to make a narration to the Prince, I have plai'd a Major in my time, with as good dacity as e're a hobby-Horse on'em all; and the Major will prompt me, let him, he shall finde, i'le stand out like a man of Coventry. Bal. What shall Joshua doe? Mi. Not know of it by any meanes, hee'l keepe more stir with the hobby-Horse, then he did with the Pipers at Tedbury Bull-running; provide thou for the Dragon, and leave me for a hobby-Horse. Ball.

Miles. You dainty Dames so finely dek'd In beauties to behold, And you that trip it up, and downe Like Lambes in Cupid's fould, Not farre from Nottingham of late, In Clifton, as I heare There dwelt a faire, and comely dame, For beauty without peere. Vrs. How now Master Miles, singing! Mi. I Mistris Vrsula, a very mery lamentable dolefull new Ditty of young Bateman, and his Nan; that ever poore young gentleman should die like a bird on a Tree, for the love to a womanâfor here it is in the third staff. Her Haire was like the crisped Gold Of't times you may perceive, The fairest face, the falsest heart, And soonest will deceive. Mistris Vrsula I give you this as a caution to remember Bateman, and his sweet, your cozen, looke on me, and veiw your selfe were it not pitty I should hang my selfe for love, and that you should die none knowes how? Why Vrsula, Neece Vrsula. Within. Vrs. Alas! what shall we doe? if my uncle comes, hee'le take thee for a Ghost, his braine is so fraught with distempers, and then falls he raging madd, Mi. Will he not strike? Why Vrsula, Neece Vrsula; Within. Vrs. Sometimes hee will, so after your fit is over, I'le prescribe a remedy against love. Enter Boote i'ns shirt. Bo.

Farewell good hobby-horseâweeheeâ Exit. Mil. 'Tis but a jades tricke Mistris Vrsula, but patience the enemy to greatnes is my content, and in that humour I will forrage on like the hobby-Horse. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Major Aldermen attendants, Queene, and Lords attendants. Qu. Master Major! We thanke you for your entertainment, And for your princely present, a cup of gold! In gratefullnes we backe returne the keyes With all the embleames of your government; We in our progresse, are a sojourner, Not an inhabitant, we will be so with you; A welcome fuller of bounty, vertue, love, We have not seene; therefore to gratulate As a small token of our princely love, On, to your former motion made for Trent. You'd have it navigable to Gainsborough So to Boston, Kingston, Humber, and Hull; But, what are the causes? Ma. By St. Lucy Besse, I am a plaine honest Tanner, my brothers here, one a Shoo-maker, to'ther a Felmonger, we are all downe right toth'hide; I ha' noe Lawyers eloquence, our Recorder cannot whistle, but by the bones of sweete St. Lucy welcome, on welcome. Qu. I have tasted your welcome, and would faine Grant your designe, soe you give reason. Ma. By St. Lucy, and shall, elce i'm an asse, and my bretheren Dotterells; Give reason, brother Sheeps-kin, second me for I must speake Historiography, History I should say, but these hard words cloy my stomacke, like lumpes of Bacon. Qu. Ya'r a merry man Master Major. Ma. I were a Traitour elce, I woo'd not be merry with thee, Besse still welcome, and welcome; Qu. On, to your Charter. Ma. Thus it was, Edward the first from whom we beare our armes, Three Crownes displaied in an Azure feilde, First, 'gan to make our River navigable, Small barks it bore, but not of that full weight, That were transportable for our affaires, In the two Edwards, the second, and third, Vnto the second Richard it continu'd Till Bulling-brooke began! then Harry the fift, And Pearcy fell at odds; in which division, Dividing of the Land; Glendower began To stop the water-courses of flowing Trent, By that meanes our navigable course was stop'd, And where before we usually transported With things un-numerous from Hull to us! And in returne releiv'd the neighbour coaste, With fuell, and commodities of great use. As Wooll, Lead, Corne, fruits, and Iron; We now have neyther; but with double cost, This is the cause why we entreate your Grace To signe our pattent, an by St Lucy, Besse; Wee'le pray for thee, and that's thy full reward. Qu. You shall enjoy your wishes; Enter. Grey, Clifton, Arguile. Omnes: Long live Elizabeth; Qu. We thanke you; Welcome renowned Iohn of Wilton, And you the war like Heroes of his traine, VVar-like Clifton; fame has ben before thee, And with her shrill Trumpe sent your praises home, E're your arrivall; rise noble John of Wilton; The onely champion of Elizabeth. Gr. Peace, and prosperity guard your sacred throne, And make your foes submissive like the French; Leith is surrenderd, the French quite expuls'd; The Scotch inhabiting their native bounds, Whom we have found most loyall to your Grace, And therefore they require their hostages Due to the federary Scottish Lords. Qu. And they shall have them; welcome bold Arguile, Thanke thou the god of batles, that hast given Prosperity to our first enterprise, Being the first Batle that we ever wag'd, Link'd victory unto a virgin's arme, For which we render thee all attributes, Guarded by thee, and these our loving subjects, We feare noe Spanish force, nor French-mens braves, Let Austria bragge; and Rome, and Italy Send out their poyson'd Darts; dreadlesse we stand Protected by thy never failing power, Lord Grey, returne you governour of Barwicke, The Duke of Norfolke, for some speciall causes VVe must recall; Arguile shall have his pleadges, VVe but reserv'd them to preserve our selves, Clifton; be thou our deputy Leivetenant, And Lord warden of Nottingham Castle, Our selfe wilbe Leivetenant of the County. For Howard, Pellham, Leake, and all the rest That in this victory shar'd with dangers, They shall participate our princely loves. Omnes: Heavens blesse your Majesty. Qu. I know not how to dignifie your deedes Without a large premeditation; Grey, and Clifton, Clifton, and war-like Grey Fought for our father, brother, and sister At Dennis, Roan, Bullen, and at Callice The bloudy sweat that Muslborough bredd At Edenborough, and now againe at Leith, In all which we fortunately conquer'd, Thankes unto heaven, next your valiant hands. Clif. Your Majesty begets a spring of youth In me an old decayed Tree of age, VVorne with as many snowy winters stormes, As makes the brauny Oake grow sap-les, Leaveles witherd, times period is ruine, Yet by my life, my heart retaines 'its vigour. And what we want in deedes, wee'le act in duty, To you the Soveraigne mistris of our hearts. Qu. Master Maior, and noble Iohn of Wilton, And war-like Clifton with all your men of warre VVe this night doe invite you, for our gueasts, To sup with us; to morrow wee'le survey The underminings, and unpaced greife That Mortimer, and Isabell did devise To steale their sportive daliancies in, Of whom your stately fortresse does retaine The Labyrinth (now called Mortimers hole) Heaven for our victory we first will pay, And praise our subjects that redeem'd the day, Proud France, and poysoning Spaine, if heave'n us blesse A virgin's arme shall quell your mightines. Omnes: Long life attend your Majesty. Exeunt Omnes. FINIS. W. S.</field>
