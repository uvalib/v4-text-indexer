      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCENE I. âA Terrace opening on the Thames. On one side the mansion of Lord Beaufort in the half distance, the gate of the grounds belonging to it at the back of the stage. On the same side, in front, another gate, supposed to open from the small garden of Scroope's cottage. On the other side, the house of the Widow Lovel. Enter Richard from the gate at the back. Not here yet! though the sun is up and bright, And shines upon her lattice as 'twould rouse The dullest sleeper! And the breath of morning Comes fresh and stirringly across the river; Yet with no air to chill thee, gentle flower, And close the lids which the sun wooes to open. Master Scroope's window standeth wideâOld Thrift Is peering ere the dawn.âI'd wage a noble He has walked a two miles down the stream to spy Some rich freight of a wealthy clime, that comes To be gorg'd by wealthier London. That a man Whose looks denote the care of decent poverty, Should carry half this river's wealth about him In the small compass of securities, Rich bills of lading, and the keys of chests, Whose precious store of gold and gems might raise An army cloth'd in pageantry! Who would deem Yon cottage, whose white neatness seems to shun The dangerous imputation of its wealth, Were the abode of beauty's costliest work, Of Mariana!âThere's an arm so round, So purely white, that opens that small casementâ Enter the Widow Lovel from her house. 'Tis drawn back suddenlyâha! plagues and torments! The gossipping rich widow! WIDOW. Master Richard! You're early up, sir! 'faith! a good ensample For young unmarried men. I told my husband, Dead and gone Master Lovelâ RICHARD. Heaven and earth! Defend me from a lecture, as interminable As she treated that poor man with! How to escapeâ WIDOW. You did not mark me, sir; it is a pleasure To discourse to one's friends and neighbours; and, save you, I've few or none to hear me. RICHARD. Her whole stock Of chattering to my shareâand Marianaâ WIDOW. There's the Lord Beaufortâyour protector; he's A proud and stately noblemanâno talking With people of that rank. RICHARD. 'Tis a great privilege Of their nobility. WIDOW. Then there's his son and heir, His honour, Master Edwardâhe's all prideâ And Master Scroope, though kind enough to one Who hath any troubles, and a calm, grave man, Will not endure one's conversation. RICHARD. Half My precious time spentâhow to send her henceâ WIDOW. And then his daughter, Mariana; faith I think the wench must be in loveâaye, now You turn and listen to me. RICHARD. Did I, faith?âIn love!âaye?âwell? WIDOW. Perhaps with the young Beaufortâ Are you not well? RICHARD. Yesâyesâwith the young Beaufort? WIDOW. Not that her eye agrees with mine in that: For my part I have seen and can see nowâ But I was talking of my talking to her; One's little tattleâsome folks call it scandal, It may be, or it may notâsoothâwhere was I? Oh! RICHARD. Oh! WIDOW. You sigh'dâwell; when I've spoken to her Some half hour, she looks full up in my face And asks me what I said. RICHARD (aside.) 'Twould puzzle you To tell her.âI shall lose the opportunityâ 'Twill be a blank day with meânot a word With Mariana. WIDOW. Now to you, who are neither Highborn, nor proud, nor rich, nor yet in love, One may talk. RICHARD. Yes, it seems so. Dame, you've heard The queen to-day will take her barge at Westminster, And sail to Greenwich. WIDOW. Is it so?âI've seen her So often I shall wait here 'till she passes And catch her from my window. RICHARD. You'll take boat, sure; There is a pageant. WIDOW. I have seen so manyâ There was the lastâtwo dolphins.â RICHARD. Yes, I saw it, 'Tis nothing unto this. Seventeen whales Meet her as she embarks, spouting aloft Floods of rich wine. WIDOW. Into the water? RICHARD. Aye. Enough to make the Thames one bowl of negus. WIDOW. Seventeen whales! RICHARD. Five great sea unicorns, Caught in Utopia, are to be harness'd Unto a car, in which her highness rides From Westminster to Greenwichâwhere a mystery, Call'd Balaam and his ass, will be presented By the corporation, and the beast will speak, As representative of the mayor and aldermen. WIDOW. A new device! RICHARD. Not altogether new, For corporations have had such interpreters, Yet pleasant. WIDOW. Very pleasant. RICHARD. You'll not miss The sight and hearing? WIDOW. Nay, forsooth, I will not. You'll come with me?â RICHARD. I've weighty business. WIDOW. What? To borrow money of old miser Scroope? He will not lend it. Come, have you no friend? Can you not guess now? Who for very kindness Would and could giveâ RICHARD. Nay that is not my need. Think of the unicorns. WIDOW. Well, well! my own barge, For I've one, waits you, if a seat and cheer, Such as the richest cellars and best larderâ RICHARD. I've neither thirst nor hungerâbut the whalesâ WIDOW. Aye, true, the seventy whales! RICHARD (aside.) I said seventeen. WIDOW. Here, John, well, Robert, (enter servants) get the boat in order. I'll sail to-dayâdirectly; (exit servants) will you not?â Remember! such a sightâ RICHARD. True, woe is me! I shall miss all and more, your company: But it must be. WIDOW. Nay, you shall have my company, Whene'er you please to ask it. RICHARD. But the mystery Of BalaamâYou'll be lateâ WIDOW. Trueâdespatch knaves! I fain would hear the ass speak. RICHARD. I've heard many, So 'tis no treat to meâbut pray away, The tide servesâdo you hear the trumpets? WIDOW. Aye, Not very wellâbut there they are, I dare sayâ My boat, knaves farewellâgentle master Richard. [Exit RICHARD. So, she is gone. WIDOW (returning.) Another word! the assâ Is it a real ass? RICHARD. Truly, I know not. The best informed, and such as are the deepest In the state secrets, say it is machinery, Inflated with a funnelâ WIDOW. With a funnel! Well, 'tis ingeniousâadieu, Master Richard. [Exit. RICHARD. She's fairly off, I hopeâAye, there she steps Aboard the boatâpush well off, lads, or else Some other questionâAdieu, gentle dameâ The gate is softly openingâall is safe, love, Come forth, my Marianaâ (Enter Mariana from gate in front. My own heart! My Mariana! What a purgatory Have I endur'dâI fear'd she ne'er would leave me, And I should lose the one hour of my day In which my soul is banquetted, that feeds me With hope and joy, that make my duller hours One dream of this short sweet time. MARIANA. It must be short This morning, Richard, for my uncle rose Early, and soon returns; he hath some business With Goldlove, that starv'd miser, or his nephew, Young Flaw, the sly, young, spendthrift lawyer, who Pretends to be enamour'd of me. RICHARD. It may be To sacrifice thee to that demon, wealth, Thy uncle worshipsâone way or the other To wed thee to old Goldlove's hoards. MARIANA. Nay, Richard, You wrong my uncle. RICHARD. He hath a sordid love Of riches, and whoe'er hath that, yields all Unto his idol. MARIANA. Thou wilt anger me; Aye, meâas gentle as you deem me, Richard My uncle is a thrifty, careful man, Frugal, abstemious, no miser, Richard. He sordid! 'tis that he will not be sordid That he is thrifty. RICHARD. A cold, unkind man! MARIANA. Your fears speak, not your judgment: he unkind! My uncle! my dear uncle! no, sir, the world Has treated him unkindlyâhe has a heart Open as yours, though not so rashly spent In feeling 'ere his head promptsâHe hath suffered Deeply from treachery, hath the doubts that age And sad experience cast, as 'twere a shield, Before our unarm'd impulse. He unkind! Didst ever hear him speak to meâor of me? Cold didst thou say? thy love is not more fervent Than his for me. RICHARD. Forgive me, Mariana. My fears did speak and not my judgment. MARIANA. Aye, I knew itâhe's my uncle and I love himâ RICHARD. And I will love him too. MARIANA. Aye, that you will. Was I angry with you?âthere's my hand. RICHARD. It trembles Yetâ MARIANA. With no anger. RICHARD. I did fear these suitors. MARIANA. And have I nought to fear? The Widow Lovelâ RICHARD. The Widow Lovelânayâ MARIANA. She's very rich, And not past thirty; and I think would find Her perch if you should whistle RICHARD. Prythee, nowâ MARIANA. Then the fair Isabel Beaufort. RICHARD. Mariana, Spare that. She's gentle, noble, goodâI would not Even know or think that sheâ MARIANA. If sheâ RICHARD. Peace! peace! My honour, faith, my love are pledg'd to you; Nor would temptations of pride, beauty, power, Cause me to hesitateâthink of another; But spare one who might almost call you sister. MARIANA. I will, I will; my spirits were too free. I might, how much more worthily, have pin'd And perish'd hopeless. RICHARD. Ah! that we could end All thoughts but those of loveâhush every doubt In fond securityâwould I dare ask Thy uncle. MARIANA. And you dare not? RICHARD. Love, what am I? An orphan, namelessâa poor idle youth. Stripped of the badgeâthe livery and protection Of the Lord Beaufortâa mere helpless thing, Without so much as a low handicraft To earn a daily pittance.âI could not I should blush for such a one to ask thy uncle For this great treasure. MARIANA. Thou'rt wealthy, Richard, In the integrity of an honest heart And gentle breedingâandâ RICHARD. What weigh these, love, Against the world's wealth? Thou'rt too dear to me To wed thee to a state of poor dependence Though 'twere my own. Lord Beaufort may promote me To state or warlike service, and I may Earn some distinction worth thee: at the worst I must strive to be patientâbeing blest But with a hope of thee. MARIANA. And fear not, Richard; I know my uncleâthere may speedier means Be found than court attendance, or promotion Won tediously by scars. Enter Bridget from the gate in front. BRIDGET. Madam, a boat, In which I think I spy your uncle with Old Goldlove and his nephew, Master Flaw, Is rowing towards the terrace. MARIANA. Leave me, Richard; And, that our farewell may not be too long, It shall not be a heavy oneâgoâhope And fear notâfare thee well. RICHARD. Farewell Mariana: I trust theeâas I love theeâwith my soulâ [Exit at upper gate. MARIANA. Farewell. Heaven bless theeâall the gracious prayers That I can think I'll breathe for theeâAh me, I shall not see him 'till the morn againâ Never 'till now was time so wearisome. Enter from a boat, on the Terrace, Scroope, Goldlove, and Flaw. SCROOPE. There's for thy fareâ (to Watermen attending). GOLDLOVE. His fareâsooth, 'tis too much. SCROOPE. Let's waste no more time on't.âWhy, Mariana, Good morrow! I had left the house an hour 'Ere thou would'st rise. Age finds small rest a-bed When the mind's stirring and abroadâand youth, Innocent and heedless, presses once again Its pillow.âYouth's sleeps are so sweet and balmy. MARIANA. Good morrow, my dear uncle: Master Goldlove And you good Master Flawâgood morningâsirs. SCROOPE. Yet is there something looks untowardly; Thine eyes are misty, girlâ MARIANA. 'Tis nought, dear uncle. SCROOPE. Well, take in Master Flaw, and bid them set A stoup or two of wine and some light cheer; The river's air has made me hungry, and Our friends will taste with us. FLAW. An opportunity Not to be miss'd.âSweet Mistress Mariana, I follow youâoh, for a simile To tell you how I follow you. MARIANA. Nay, sirâ Rack not your brain for it, 'twill keep you fastingâ Try if my uncle's wine inspire you, sir. [Exit. FLAW. A challenge, faithâshe's struckânow, Master Flaw, Speak and she's won. [Exit. SCROOPE. Will't please you to walk in? Come, Master Goldloveâwe'll dispatch that matter About the Indian tissues. GOLDLOVE. I but came, sir, To give my nephew countenance with your nieceâ As for the tissues we will talk on Change: He'll win her heart, sir. SCROOPE. 'Tis a difficult prize. GOLDLOVE. But he's a lawyer, has a tongue is young, too, Swears, dances, drinks. SCROOPE. These are accomplishments; But yet I think her safe. GOLDLOVE. Makes poetry SCROOPE. Ay, that's a subtle stealer of the heart: I thought he but wrote verses. GOLDLOVE. Tis the same thing? SCROOPE. Not quite. GOLDLOVE. Dispatch him soon. SCROOPE. I will not keep him Longer than needful. GOLDLOVE. Thank yeâthank yeâfarewell. [Exit. SCROOPE. FarewellâI'll watch my neice and my young lawyer! My poet!âthat's a rare, unheard of unionâ Ha! ha! a poet! This is poetry, The sun, the rippling streamâthe mighty wealth Of nations clustering to our London mart, The grandeur of pure nature and of man In his proud enterprize, his lofty passions, And his sublime enduranceâall that tends To lift the spirit upwards from controul Of baseness:â'tis the heaven of high thoughts That stirs our earthly naturesâand this verse makerâ A poet!âWellâI'll join them. [Exit. SCENE II. âThe interior of Scroope's houseâA parlour neatly furnished and bearing every mark of wealthy comfortâBooks, paintings, musical instruments, &amp;c. Flaw and Mariana. FLAW. Tush, my fair mistress, I am not that dull assâ A studious lawyer. MARIANA. I wrong'd you not so much, sir. FLAW. It were a wrong, indeedâOld musty Lyttleton May grow yet mouldier for meâI'm not A shelf to carry foliosâI but study As much law as will pass with my old uncleâ MARIANA. To make his will, sir? FLAW. If 'twere in my favour I would not draw it up myselfâNo, ladyâ I'm for the stirring humours of the timesâ The ordinaries, plays, the bear-garden. Now of all things I love a bear-garden, Unless 'tis poetry. MARIANA. Ay, sir, 'tis difficult To choose between them. FLAW. Then there are the roarers, The brave Alsatians that despise the law And such weak cobwebsâ MARIANA. And you know them too, sir? FLAW. Ay, marry, and have led them in some rambles. There was the last great robbery, of the plate MARIANA. Why, surely, sir FLAW. Nay, nay, I would not boastâ But he's no lad of spirit and true mettle That hasn't seen the worldâWhy, there's Will Shakspeare In his last play of Falstaff, makes a king's son Turn highwayman for true sportâand they say, too, And I have heard him jest on't o'er his cups, That he once stole a deer. MARIANA. Then you know Shakespeare? FLAW. Know himâI've heard him swear 'tis such as I That he most loves to talk withâand I've seen A thing or two I've said in printâbut car'd not To challenge it. Here comes your uncle, lady. Enter Scroope. And I had much to say to you. SCROOPE. Say on, sirâ I'll listen to you, too. MARIANA. Or Master Flaw Can speak with you alone, sir. FLAW. What! already! I've made short work of it. (Aside.) SCROOPE. My girl, I'll spare you The pains of hearing him (aside to her.) Go, Mariana, And bid Will wait me in the counting-room With the account 'twixt me and Master Goldlove; He will be here anon. MARIANA. I shall, dear uncle. [Exit. FLAW. And ere my uncle Goldlove comeâI'd beg, sir, Your ear to a proposalâ SCROOPE. Come, speak out, sirâ My nieceâ FLAW. Sooth, sir, if I can guess her mind, She hath left us here together that I may Speak her desires as well as mineâI love her. SCROOPE. And think you she returns your passion? FLAW. Nay. I know not yetâlove hath its ceremonies, Its toys and trifles, serenades, love versesâ Then come the walks to Moorfields, progresses By water down to Greenwich; all which duties I long to pay her. SCROOPE. Well, sir,âwin and wed her. Her answer's mineâbut to pursue such wooing Must to a young man, Master Goldlove's heir, Who's not profuse in his allowance to you, As I should guess, be somewhat chargeable; I have a hundred marks now unemployed, Which if you choose to borrowâ FLAW. I could pay it Upon my marriage or my uncle's death, Or any other fortunate timeâ SCROOPE. True, true, sir. FLAW. And 'tis an omen, sir, of your good wishes. I hope for my acceptance with your niece. SCROOPE. Whatever it is I lend it freely, sir. FLAW. Whate'er interest? SCROOPE. Seal me but your bond For the repayment when I call on you; I am no usurer, and lend the money In hope of no such profit. Pray you step Into my counting-room, and bid my clerk Prepare the writing and tell out the gold. FLAW. I'll do it gladly, sir. [Exit. SCROOPE. So, he is mine. Enter Bridget. Come hither, Bridget; thou for fifteen years Hast been a faithful servant. BRIDGET. Ay, sirâfaithful To a kind master. SCROOPE. Good, then! Tell me, Bridget, What suitors hath my niece, besides the three That have been here this morning?âas I think Goldlove, or Flaw, or Parallel, could never Call blushes on her cheekâunthought-of tears Within her downcast eye; unconscious sighs, And that soft, gentle, happy melancholy That links all joys and sufferings of our thoughts In love. BRIDGET. I should not tell, perhaps. SCROOPE. I ask not For what in delicate and womanly feeling She may have trusted to thee; I but ask Of my old servant that which her fidelity To me requires she should tell me. Fear not; I think you've never known me use authority Cruelly to any; and my nieceâ BRIDGET. The young Beaufort Hath spoken to her. SCROOPE. Ay, she told me so, Yet neither proudly nor yet timidly. Young Beaufortâ'tis a name I love notâbut If 'twere so, it might be a noble cause To arouse the charity I scarcely owe To that proud house. BRIDGET. Thenâbut I fear you'll chide herâ She hath conversed, and more than once, with Richard, Lord Beaufort's pageâRichard Fitz-Allanâ SCROOPE. Wherefore Should I chide, Bridget? BRIDGET. He's so gay and wildâ Thoughtless and kind too. SCROOPE. Happy, happy youth! Fervid and generous youth! Shall our age dare To envy and condemn thee? I have been young, Though my life had but little youth in it. BRIDGET. But he's so poorâI thoughtâ SCROOPE. And I so rich, Have such a weight of needless wealth. BRIDGET. And he's Somewhat improvident. SCROOPE. What hath he had To make him provident? Improvident Of my Lord Beaufort's pittance!âA just prudence Comes oft with means of prudence. BRIDGET. You're not angry For that they've met? SCROOPE. No. I would but secure Her in a state as near to happiness As earth may grantâcontent, or peace, or ease, Whate'er it may be. Once I had belief In happiness, and though for me 'twas madness, Yet I'd resign the wisdom of experience To hope she might be happy. BRIDGET. The young Beaufortâ SCROOPE. A hornet! I'll enmesh himâgoldâgoldâgold! And thinks't thou he or Richard?â BRIDGET. That I know not. A lord's sonâand to be my Lady Beaufortâ SCROOPE. Are prizes to most womenâtoys to her; At least if I can judge her. Stay!âno matter, I must not bribe fidelity. I'll pay it Some other time (aside.) Go to your mistress, Bridget, And no word of our talk. BRIDGET. I shall observe, sir. [Exit. SCROOPE. Yes, all!âthe hornet, Beaufort, and the bee, Young Richardâall!âI'll play the spider with: But with no venom'd sting. Young Beaufort's needs Are open: I can buy him cheap. I have This first care of my life despatch'd and clear; The full account of my affections closed With Mariana's marriage. Then for Beaufort. Lord Beaufortâthe proud nobleman: his mortgage Expires to-day. His houses, lands, himself, All are within my grasp. Let but my heart Pour out its charities on Mariana, Then for a sterner and a stricter auditâ Severe and equal justice with Lord Beaufort. [Exit. END OF ACT. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Gardens of Beaufort's House. Enter Richard and Isabel. ISABEL. Richard! You must serve me in a matter of some trust; There are some jewels I would sellâthere's none I would trust as I do youâwill you?â RICHARD. Your jewels? Sell them? ISABEL. (hesitating.) They're old and useless, andâ RICHARD. I'll do As you would have me, madam; pardon me! I was surprised. ISABEL. Yet must you know the truth, And I dare trust youâmy poor father's ruined. RICHARD. Ruined? Lord Beaufort! my kind benefactor! And you, my kindest mistress. ISABEL. Your friend, Richard, And one who'll grieve to part from youâperchance We may scarce see each other more. RICHARD. If fortune Doom me to sorrow, it but little matters By how few it is shared; but should I thrive I must return to those who are my home, And claim their joy with mineâO, that I thus Might greet you! ISABEL. Would you, Richard? RICHARD. Call you sister! ISABEL. Sister! RICHARD. I am too bold. ISABEL. No. Be it so. âSister:â You are henceforth my brother. RICHARD. A proud title To urge me to desert. ISABEL. See, some one comes. I'll hence and bring the jewels. [Exit. RICHARD. Poor! poor girl! Reared in the genial clime of soft indulgence How wilt thou shrink before the nipping blast That sweeps along the barren icy shore To which thou'rt banished? Fortune is but cowardly To wreak its wrath on thee. Enter Edward. EDWARD. Why, how now, Richard? Thou with a moody brow! RICHARD. Nay, nay; 'tis nothing. EDWARD. Is it that Spendall presses thee for money? We're at our last: my father's purse is empty. But what! cheer up! I have a plan shall save all. There's the old miser, Scroope, hath a fair neice. RICHARD. Mariana! EDWARD. Ay, thou knowest herâI will wed her. Titles may weigh with goldâI shall have riches; She shall be called my ladyâwhy, what ails thee? Thou hast no hopes there? RICHARD. None; I fear me, none. EDWARD. Nay, if thou lovest herâand that cheek of thine Gives me shrewd guessesâthou must yield her, Richard. What could'st thou offer to her careful uncle In barter for his gold? RICHARD. Nothing. Yet, mark me, Thou must not rival me with Mariana. EDWARD. Rival thee? RICHARD. Ay; although I have no hope, No fortune, title, name, or quality Of mind or person, that should bid me hope, Thou must not rival me with Mariana. EDWARD. Rival! Dost think thou art my equal? RICHARD. Ay; In this more than thine equal. Boast thy rankâ Add to it wealthâaye, pile on pile of gold; Estates unmeasured, gems 'bove price, and then, Still will I brave thee. Psha! thou knowest her not. Mariana hath a heart. Scroope appears at the gate. EDWARD. And here is one To whom your high pretensions may be spoken, What, Master Scroope, good day! Please you walk in; You have not seen the grounds here. [Richard retires. Enter Scroope at garden gate. SCROOPE. 'Tis, indeed, Some time since. EDWARD. When, man? SCROOPE. Oh! I had forgotten. These groundsâ EDWARD. Why, you were deep in other thought. SCROOPE. I was, indeed. EDWARD. Making a calculation Of your last venture's profit, or the outlay For your next merchandize. SCROOPE. My mind, sir, is not Ever upon such trifles. EDWARD. Trifles! SCROOPE. Aye, I have wealth enough now to afford to feel. Pleasures, enjoyments, e'en domestic loves, Are, with the poor, called idle; with the rich, They are feelings, tastes, and generous sentiments. I have earned the rights which I once idly thought Were nature's. EDWARD. You've enjoyments in your wealth That many envy youâaltho' they'd use it In a different kindânot contemplate, but spend it. SCROOPE. Yes, sir, I have enjoyments in my wealth; And sometimes love to contemplate my riches. Not that the chink of gold 'gainst gold can sound A miser's music in my earsâor diamonds, With care kept from the sun, dazzle my eyes With an unholy lustre, when a lamp Stealthily shines upon my hoards; my wealth I think of for its use. What are the pleasures Men covet most? I have the power of all. What hath the world that I dare not call mine? Show me the palace, the rich furniture, The fair domain, the meiny of attendants I cannot make mine own? this is mere pomp. Show me the luxuriesâthe costly wines The thousand pleasures that poor ingenuity Starves to invent to pamper the dull rich,â E'en with a word they're mine; but this is sensual. Show me the knowledge I may not controul, The learning that I cannot buy, the talents, Nay, e'en the genius, that I cannot claim To mine own use; but this, you'll say, is heartless. Show me the friend would spurn my offered hand 'Tho I were baseness' self; show me the love, 'Tho e'en I were decrepitude, could ward My golden shower from DanÃ¤e's lap. They are, I own, but mercenary minds That could be won thusâbut my wealth, sir, gives me A power o'er men's hearts as well as actions: It can controul the proud, support the weak, Confront mean greatness with an equal port, And cheer with happy hope poor humble meritâ Strive with the bitterest foes that crush young hearts, Relieve old age's cares, soothe pain and sickness, And make the happiest lovers bless its power, E'en mid the fervour of their holiest thoughts. Yes, sir, I have enjoyments in my wealth, And I do love to contemplate its might. EDWARD. You argue well for it. SCROOPE. There are other uses Which time may prove for itâthey may be felt, Not spoken:âmeanwhile I've an argument Would win e'en you to praise it. EDWARD. Nay, I am bound To railâI'm poor enough to make common cause 'Gainst its possessors. SCROOPE. Say that I should lend you What you may need or wish? EDWARD. I've no rich jewels, Nor vast reversions to bind over to you: My father hath left his heir not even that chance To move the hearts of lenders. SCROOPE. Your own bond Shall well suffice me for three hundred pounds. EDWARD. Nay, it shall ne'er be said I lost the money Because I would not ask it. I confess I'm a full convert to your argument. SCROOPE. In time you will be. EDWARD. There's a threat in that. SCROOPE. You fear yourself, not me, if you refuse it. EDWARD. Well, well, lend me the money. Enter Richard. Master Scroope Lends me three hundred pounds, tho' for what reason I'll not e'en strive to guess. SCROOPE. Another debtor! Yes, though you wonder. RICHARD. How? SCROOPE. You know one Spendall? He is a bankrupt; I'm his creditorâ His chief, almost his only creditor. You owe him money: if you prove deserving, And I'm no rigid censor of my friendship, You shall owe me nought but gentle gratitude. RICHARD. I thank you frankly. SCROOPE. Give me then you hand on't. Your's is a face recals to me some joys, When I was young and buoyant, that would sparkle, Thus in the eye. I'll not betray your friendship, Stand you but true to mine. (To Edward) Within this half hour I shall expect you. EDWARD. 'Tis a miracle, Or his familiar fiend, the demon, gold, Is leading him in quagmires. Parallel! Enter Parallel. PARALLEL. I saw old Master Scroope here: hath he left you? RICHARD. Yes, Master Parallel, and left us merrier That he hath been here. PARALLEL. Would that I had seen him. RICHARD. Why, master tutor, you look somewhat fearful: What is the matter, sir? PARALLEL. Nay, nothing, nothing. I must to Master Scroope's. EDWARD. And wherefore thither? PARALLEL. For money. EDWARD. Why, what pawn would'st offer him? PARALLEL. None; yet he'll lend me. RICHARD. Thee too? What need'st thou? PARALLEL. Ten marks to pay A tailor for a suit I had at college. I thought he had forgetten meâyet now I saw his ominous visage o'er the shoulder Of one o' the city's varlets, and I feared Lest he should spy me: all my hopes were gone Were I arrested nowâfirst Mariana. RICHARD. Master Scroope's niece. PARALLEL. Ay, ayâWhy, wherefore laugh ye? He offered me this morning a large sum, I warrant in his mind, full twenty marks. EDWARD. Well, take it Master Parallel, and all Are then his debtors, Richard, 'gainst his will, And I with mine: whate'er the merchant seeks We shall have our venerable tutor here In the same predicament. In half an hour, Or less, you'll meet with Scroope at his own house. [Exeunt Edward and Parallel into house. Enter Isabel with a casket. ISABEL. I have watched till you were alone. You can dispose Of these, and keep a hundred pounds, in which I but pay my father's debts. RICHARD. Not so, dear lady. Not soâby heaven! I would not take from him To whom I owe my nurture, one poor doit Now in his poverty. I am too much bound to him, Too hopelessly. And youâit is not kind, At parting thus, by deeds to call me selfish. I will not touch those jewels. ISABEL. Yes, for me! For I shall need your serviceâbut for me! RICHARD. Ay, you will promise to receive the moneyâ All, or I touch them not. ISABEL. I promise it. [Edward appears from the house. RICHARD. Then give me them and I will find a chapman, A fair and honest oneâand I thank heaven He's known to meâand even from him I'll urge The extremest value for your sakeâfarewell. [Exit at gate. ISABEL. Noble and generous youthâI will not leave thee In debt to some harsh creditorâhe'll gladly Receive the gold which thou refusest proudly. Edward! EDWARD. Aye, Isabel, blush notâwhat was't You gave to Richard? Girl, if you'd buy hearts, 'Twere well you chose a true one. ISABEL. You're sententious. Have you done? There may be yet another venture In which I would embark my little store, One of pure friendship, brother:âit may be, Richard refuses even that kindness from me. EDWARD. No anger, Isabel! Our time of pride Is past, and had Fitz-Alan been your lover You had removed a somewhat from my path, An obstacle, it may be, or a rival; But we shall see.âFarewell. [Exit at gate. ISABEL. Why did I not Reply with scorn to this imputed folly? For it were folly nowâonce I had thought it A generous sacrificeâperchance a happy one: But he loves anotherâI am now his sister. I have with care enquired of his debts And thus, at least, against his will, I'll serve him. [Exit. SCENE II. âScroope's Counting-house. Scroope and William. SCROOPE. Place this bond of young Beaufort's in the chest, The iron safeâI have him there securely. [Exit William. The hour approaches for my forfeit mortgage, How shall I deal with him? If ever vengeance Were holyâbut it is notâthere's a peace, A calm content of conscience, will not dwell With wrath, however seeming just.âWho feels That he is frail, dares not revenge, but trusts To mercy for the showing it. I'll be calm, I will do even justiceâmore, show mercy, Lest I should be unjust. Enter Richard with the casket How now, my friend! A momentâI was thinkingâWell, what would you? RICHARD. I come to trade, sir, with you SCROOPE. Aye, have with you! In what? RICHARD. These jewels: I would sell them. SCROOPE. How! These are a woman's gear. RICHARD. Pray ask no questions. If you would show me friendship, I would have The utmost value for them. SCROOPE. That's strange trading. RICHARD. Well. thenâ SCROOPE. But you said âfriendship,â I allow it. You shall have their utmost value: let me see them. Why, what is this? [Takes up a ring. RICHARD. A ringâa little ring. There are richer jewels. SCROOPE. Yes, this ring was hers. There is the cipher which I marked myself, And gave it her. RICHARD. You're moved! SCROOPE. Aye, there are memories Between me and the house of Beaufort, which This ring, as 'twere a talisman, calls up In clear and distinct vision. Methinks I see her, And by this token, this, the holiest token, She calls for vengeance. You have seen me moved At a strange causeâat least to you. We are, You have said it, friends. RICHARD. I haveâhow can I proveâ? SCROOPE. You will be silent, as you had not known it, Of this my strange emotion. RICHARD. You've my word. SCROOPE. Enough, now leave me.âAh, the jewels!âyes, I recked not of them; I will send their value, Their full and ample value, to you straight, And something, too, for thisâthis priceless ring! Go, wonder, but be silent. RICHARD. Fear me not, sir. [Exit SCROOPE. My poor, poor wife! and this was thine, the pledgeâ The first pledge of my love. What mystery Is there in providence to send me this, Now, in the very tide of my strong power? Thou bauble, would thou wert intelligent Of the future as the pastâfor so much love, And so much bitter wrong, thou speak'st to me To shake my very nature to its centre. As the final trumpet-call shall rend the earth Changing the laws of being. MARIANA (without.) William! William! SCROOPE. Mariana's voice! Ay, let me think of her, No pain can share with that thoughtâMariana! Yet lie thou near my heart, for thou'rt a symbol Of love, which grief could but grave deeper thereâ Of love, which Death could only make immortal. SCENE III. âThe Terrace, as in Act I., Scene I. RICHARD and MARIANA. MARIANA. And must you leave us? What sad chance is this? Even as my hopes were brightest, for my uncle Spoke kindly of you. I said ye had hearts To love each otherâdid I not? RICHARD. Sweet prophet! And wilt thou love me, Mariana, still? Though proud fate trample on me, tho' my lot Be poverty and scornâthough chilling absenceâ MARIANA. Speak not so sadly; see, here comes old Goldlove, And your friend, if he be so, Edward Beaufort. RICHARD. Let's walk from them; I've much to say. Enter Widow Lovel from her house; takes Richard's arm. S'death, she here! Enter Edward and Goldlove, who go to Mariana. WIDOW. You are a wise youth, Master Richard, thus To listen to advice; nay, come for it. You have received my letter? RICHARD (aside.) I had forgotten it, Or ne'er had ventured hither. WIDOW. I am well pleased With this mark of your punctual courtesy, And will, in due time, thank you for it; but first I have a quarrel with you. RICHARD. Pray you, dame, Spare both your thanks and anger, and so make The matter even. WIDOW. Nay, to send me up As far as Westminster, to see the queen, The whales, the unicorn, and Balaam's ass, And there was no such sight, nor any sign Of progress or procession! RICHARD. Woe is me! Just as you quitted me, I had bethought me My information was apocryphal; I had it from a sort of Jesuit I' th' service of the Pope and King of Spain, As I learnt afterwards. WIDOW. A per'lous traitor! To spread his false reports! you should reveal him To my Lord Mayor. RICHARD. I would, if it were possible To find him. WIDOW. Well, the truth's the best excuse; Therefore I pardon you: but I must blame you In another sort. RICHARD. Some other time, dear lady WIDOW. âThere's no time like the present,â says the proverb; And, sooth, there's many a true proverb.âCome This way; they'd fain o'erhear us;âI must tell you It touches you to hear me.â RICHARD. Sure, St. Anthony Had ne'er severer trials of his patience. [They go up. EDWARD. Now for one fortunate instant; I may speak To you aloneâI love you, Mariana. MARIANA. Pray, spare me, sir, I am not worthy. EDWARD. Nay, Deny me not an hour of gentle converse, That I may urge my suitâwe are now too public. MARIANA. Not for the answer I must give you, sir. I thank you, and, that said, I've but one word; My heart's another's, and, as you are noble, You'll scorn to urge me further. EDWARD. So, 'tis Richard's. Well, 'tis a pity that he prizes not The preference:âare you content to share His love with yon gay widow? See, she leads him In a close converse and bends fondly toward him And heâ MARIANA. Endures it, sir!âbut who hath told you 'Tis he who hath my heart? EDWARD. Do you deny it? MARIANA. Have you the right to question? Yet I'll answer. He's mine, and I am his; if there be truth In the soul's languageâin that fervid trust, Which, without vows or any other bond Than that of innocent truth, plights guileless love Firmly as though the troth were pledged in heaven, From which the affection sprung.âI love him, sir, And trust him, and the meaning of your brow, Deep drawn as 'twas when speaking of yon widow, I answer with a smile.âYou cannot smile too, For you would wrong your friend. EDWARD. I but surmisedâ MARIANA. Well, sir, you see how much I share your fears. I leave them to their converseâfare you well, sir. [Exit. EDWARD. So 'tis is a prosperous day with me, yon proud one!â But even her pride's a spur to my desires, Makes them o'erleap the formal barrier conscience, Which, at the first, I shrunk from. I'll accept His boastful challenge.âI should like to change His triumph into disappointed angerâ My envy to victorious malice. Come! They wait us, RichardâI've a thought shall do it. Those jewels! I may frame a tale from them! Richard, I say; the bell sounding dinner! RICHARD. I comeâfarewell, my gentle dame. WIDOW. To-morrow I will pursue my counselâor indeed This afternoonâcannot you dine with me? RICHARD. Excuse me; I am expected. WIDOW. Well, sir, well, Remember I shall wait you. [Exit. RICHARD. You shall wait me Indeed, or ere I come, my gentle mistress; I must have even called some sudden sickness, The plague, or some such kind disease, to scare her; For as you spoke I dreaded an avowal In plain and open terms. See, she is peeping Now from her casementârun, or I'm her prisoner. [Exit. EDWARD. A plague upon his fortunes, or his face, I know not which, that women thus doat on him. Enter Parallel from Scroope's. EDWARD. So, Master Parallel, I need your service. PARALLEL. Why, service hath its kind, degree, condition, Honour, dishonour, safety, peril, accidents, Beyond enumeration. EDWARD. My request Is first your silenceâI'd have your assistance In my suit to Mariana. PARALLEL. Humph! that can't be. I have hopes of her myself. EDWARD. You hopes of her! What, 'cause you have a loan from Master Scroope? PARALLEL. I have, sir, and I'm brave in it; for this bravery Hath many kinds, the bravery of soul, The bravery of purse, of dress, of lineage, Ofâ EDWARD. Stay! Is yours a bravery to meet A tailor and two varlets? PARALLEL. You shall see, sir. Ay! they're the very hang dogsâMark my bearing! It shall be a specimen of that true courage That springs from what's within.â(Chinking a purse.) A fortitude Can answer all draughts on it. Enter Tailor, and two Officers. So! approach, sirs. I have sought longâ(aside)âto keep out of your way. It troubles me to carry money with me That's not mine own; for the first joy of money Is the right to expend it. TAILOR. Please your worship I'm glad, indeed, we've found you; but, good varlet, Tap him o' th' shoulder, or we lose our costs. You are arrested, sir. PARALLEL. Ay, ay, arrested. Where's your demand? Some ten marks, is it not? Mark but my bearing (to Edward.) Rascal! here they are. TAILOR. Alas! good sir, ten marks will pay but little Of the debt now. PARALLEL. How? TAILOR. Costs, sir, have accrued. I'm sorry that your worship found me not: I've been at charges for an outlawry: And that, with the attendance of our friends here, Shall let you cheaply off at twenty pounds. EDWARD (to Parallel.) Well, sir, I mark your bearing. PARALLEL. Twenty pounds! EDWARD. A perfect specimen of fortitude Which springs from that within! PARALLEL. Twenty pounds! Ruined! EDWARD. Stay! these are friends, and merciful, no doubt. You, sirâ(to Tailor.) TAILOR. Oh no, sir, we have caught him now: And, by the livery of our company, Their arms, the needle, goose, and fatal shears!â Or all that can be thought more dread and solemnâ I swear I'll have his body or the payment. PARALLEL. In full? TAILOR. In full.âI told you I would do it If you paid not. PARALLEL. All things conspire against me! Even tailors keep their words! EDWARD. Your leave a moment! TAILOR. Is it to speak upon the means of payment? EDWARD. It is. TAILOR. Then stand you hereâyou post yourself By this gate, and be ready with your poles To knock him down if he should stir. Now, sir, [to Par. You're quite at liberty. EDWARD. Where are your hopes now Of Mariana? PARALLEL. Oh, 'tis cruel, thus To mock me in my mortal agony, For death has many doors; we'll say some forty Firstâ EDWARD. Zounds! Is this a time to talk divisions? I'll pay the debt. PARALLEL. You will? EDWARD. On one condition. You've now no hope of Mariana? PARALLEL (sighs.) True! EDWARD. But I may have some yetâif you will join me In a slight slander, aid me to devise it, And then deliver it to Mariana. You are a grave, staid person, and your words May be, perchance, believed. Say, will you do this If I should free you? PARALLEL. I'll do any thing. EDWARD. You may ask audience of her as a suitor, For all these are admitted, and then speak What we shall plan for you. PARALLEL. But whoop these hounds off, I'll say or swear whatever you direct me. TAILOR. Are we to have the money? EDWARD. Friends! bear witness, I lend him twenty pounds to pay his debt, And at his strong entreatyâIs't not so? [To Par. PARALLEL. At my most strong, importunate entreaty. EDWARD. There 'tis, and he is free (gives money.) TAILOR. Thanks! noble sir. to Par.] There is my hand, sir, I bear no man malice. It always grieves me to lock up my customers. Come friendsâyou'll chance, perhaps, to want a suit? PARALLEL. No; no more of your suits, they fit me not. [Exit Tailor, &amp;c. EDWARD. Come, Master Parallel, come, a cup of wine, And then to make me a repayment. PARALLEL. Ay! You're a fit type of Lucifer; you've saved My body but to catch my soul. EDWARD. Your body's Nothing to boast of; yet best of the twain. But come and learn your lesson, my grave tutor. [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Garden or Court-yard of Scroope's house. Before the house, R. H., a porch with seats in it. The entrance gate opening inwards, L. H. Scroope meeting Isabel. ISABEL. I would speak with Master Scroope. SCROOPE. He waits your pleasure. ISABEL. There is a debt due to you from Fitz-Alan, My father's pageâsome fifty poundsâon his part I come to pay it. SCROOPE. On your father's part? His steward thenâpardon meâyours is not A face that I dare crimson, or a heart That I dare pain; but this account of Richard's Must not be settled thus. ISABEL. Why, what expect you More than the payment? SCROOPE. Not so much, perhaps, Unless I am sure from whom that payment comes. I am a cautious man, honest withal: Should I rob the child who'd pay her father's debts, His very kindnesses, out of the store, The little store, his prodigality Has left her? ISABEL. Nay, sir. SCROOPE. I have a right to praise you, Nearer than you would thinkâa right to love you. Richard is free on one condition only. ISABEL. Name it. SCROOPE. That you receive the jewels which You sent by him this morning. He has not Betray'd youânor would I, even if I could Read aught in you that is not just and noble.â I'll bring the jewels. ISABEL. Nayâ SCROOPE. If, ere the night fall You think that you should not receive them from me Give them again. ISABEL. I know not how to doubt you. Stay, some one comes, I'd not be seen. SCROOPE. Nor shall you. 'Tis Master Parallel with my niece, step in And rest you in that chamber. I will sit Here in the porch. [Exit Isabel. [Scroope sits in the porch. Mariana and Parallel enter at the gate.] MARIANA. Come in, grave sir! PARALLEL. Nay, not grave now, sweet mistress; The subject I would treat of is a gay one,â That is, it hath, when properly divided, Both gaiety and gravity, being Love; Which is a feeling, passion, or sensation, To be handled logically, thusâ MARIANA. Good, sir, Is't thus you would be gay? PARALLEL. If you but wait Until the thirteenth point you'll see how merrily And wittily 'tis treated. MARIANA. Come! away sir With all this musty logic! I'm unlearned And fain would hear you in a simpler tongue. (Enter Edward unperceived.) EDWARD. I'll listen how my pupil-tutor speeds In the lesson I have taught him! ha! the porch there! [Approaches the porch gradually during the dialogue. MARIANA. What news abroad, sir, or what scandal have you? PARALLEL. Scandal! MARIANA. Aye, scandal, that's our Latin, sir; And if you are not learned in that tongue You'll gain no honours in a female college. PARALLEL. Scandal,âwhy, noâyet yes; for, to speak plainly, Scandal is not at all times scandalous. MARIANA. Oh, no. PARALLEL. And there are pleasing, light discourses, In which we sift and analyse the feelings Of friends, which savour strongly of humanity. MARIANA. Certainly. PARALLEL. For we know that human nature Hath two sides at the least. MARIANA. To understand it, We must turn it inside out. PARALLEL. Exactly so. Now of yourself. MARIANA. Of me! Scandal of me! PARALLEL. No, that might not amuse you; but of one Who, being one, would of that one make twain, Yet of the twain but one. One who would wed you. MARIANA. One of my lovers? PARALLEL. Ay, Richard Fitz-Alan. [Richard appears at gate; hearing his name, stops; goes behind the door and listens. There was some noise. MARIANA. Nay, nothing; pray, go on. PARALLEL. Ahem! hem! [Edward has now gained the porch. EDWARD (sees SCROOPE.) Ha! SCROOPE. Silence! Enter! Sit you down PARALLEL. There was a noise that way. [Mariana and Scroope exchange signals. MARIANA. Nay; nothing, nothing. What is it you would say of Richard? PARALLEL. Ah! you love him. Nay, do not blush, there are none by to hear us. Hem! To divideâ MARIANA. Divide! PARALLEL. As one might say, Cut up his character. MARIANA. Yes, that's the pointâ Cut up his character. PARALLEL. We may consider it Under five heads; as, first, his love to you, Which branches into two considerations, As, whether it be real or pretended. MARIANA. Good, sooth! I've sometimes doubted that. [Looking at Richard PARALLEL. Ay, doubt Is parent of all truth. But, to proceed: Marry, now, treat the point Socratically. How many doors or entrances hath love Into the heart? MARIANA. As many as the senses. All are love's portals; though, when the proudest comes, He comes, as conqueror's use, by his own path, And sympathy's that breach. PARALLEL. Ay, ay, that's well! But, I know not how it is, to speak of love No maid discusses it with logical propriety. MARIANA. But Richardâ PARALLEL. You're impatient. I'll be brief, And handle but these facts: that he hath seen The lady Isabel Beaufort; then discuss Her beauty, and its probable effects; Thence turning to her poverty, the changes Which that might work, proving that interest Hath sometimes, too, its share in marriage, thence Descanting on his change from her to you, And touching, as a pleasant episode, Upon some jewels which to-day she gave him. RICHARD. (Aside) Malignant slanderer! PARALLEL. What noise was that? MARIANA. Nothing. You'd pledge your honour to the truth Of such a strange narration? PARALLEL. Marry would I. For if the premises be false, the argument That might be built thereon, howe'er ingenious, Were but a rope of sand. RICHARD. (Aside) The unblushing rascal! MARIANA. Hush! as you love. RICHARD. I'd kill and eat the villain. MARIANA. 'Twere better I should turn my thoughts from him And fix them on a wiser, sadder man. PARALLEL. What! can it be! âa wiser, sadder man!â (aside.) MARIANA. And yet I know but one. PARALLEL. (Aside) She must mean me. Oh happy Parallel! at length your studies Will meet their due reward. [Richard threatening in gesture. MARIANA. True, Edward Beaufort Has offer'd me his hand. PARALLEL. (Aside) I may supplant him. I should like much to read a lecture to you Of many various vices which are mingled So curiously in him 'twould be delightful To expatiate upon so fine a subject. EDWARD. How! SCROOPE. Listen! If 'tis false you may be patient. PARALLEL. First! his cold heart and selfishnessâexample, A tale of him and an Italian girl, A poor forsakenâ EDWARD. Death! the peerless villain. SCROOPE. Silence! I say: hear out the sland'rous falsehood. PARALLEL. Of facts, thusâHow he brought her from the Low Countries; How, while he lov'd, he furnish'd her with gold; But nowâ EDWARD. The slave (aside.) PARALLEL. I'm sure I heard a noise. MARIANA. Go on, go on. PARALLEL. Then taking fit occasion To move the hearer's feelings by relation; For feeling may sometimes be used to open The ears to a discourseâ MARIANA. It may, indeed! PARALLEL. By the relation how he abandoned her, Poor, friendless, far from home, strange to our language, With many other happy points. MARIANA. The heartless, Unfeeling wretch! I'st true? PARALLEL. True!âdo but offer What solemn oath you please, and I will swear it. SCROOPE (restraining Edward.) Nay, be not mov'd: whoever speaks a lie Will, save from fear, as easily swear to it. MARIANA. Poor girl! base villain! Pardon, worthy sir, I was thinking.âMine's a most unhappy case: Where shall I find a suitor true and honest? PARALLEL. Might I presume to speak to you of love? MARIANA. You! PARALLEL. Aye. I will not now speak of divisions In which to handle the sweet subject, since 'Tis union not division that I seekâ By this fair handâ(kneeling.) [Parallel, in some confusion, has kept his eyes averted during the previous speech. Mariana has beckoned on Richard and placed him between her and Parallel, who takes Richard's hand before he sees him. RICHARD. Well, sir, why don't you swear? 'Tis the first time that you have hesitated. (Draws) 'Sblood but I'll end thee on the spot. I'll make thee The martyr as th' apostle of all slander. PARALLEL. Oh! mercy, mercy! RICHARD. Straight confess thy sins! Knowest thou one act of mine, one simple word, To justify thy monstrous lies? PARALLEL. Not one. Save thatâI've heardâthe jewelsâ RICHARD. But their useâ By my honour, I am free (to Mariana.) What know you of it? PARALLEL. Nothing. RICHARD. Nor why I took them? PARALLEL. No. RICHARD. These falsehoodsâ What motive hadst thou to invent them? Speak! PARALLEL. Must I tell all? RICHARD. Or die, by my just wrath! PARALLEL. I was set on by Master Edward Beaufort. RICHARD. Rise, wretch, andâ MARIANA (looking at Edward.) Stay! hold yet your sword to him For then he swears sincerely. Spoke you truth In what you said of Beaufort? PARALLEL. Very nearly, Not much embellished. RICHARD. Go. EDWARD (advancing as Parallel retreats.) Scandalous liar! I, too, have overheard thee! SCROOPE. Kill him notâ His fears at least have made us some amends: We have learnt more from him than you intended. PARALLEL. I've but improved upon some hints you gave me, Placing them, as a man of learning should do, In apt and proper order and division. SCROOPE. So far, at least, he's stedfast. I'll protect thee In this, thy just avowal. You have made, sirs, A pretty hiding-place of my poor garden. I wish you joy o' the sport. EDWARD. Do you believe, then, Fair Mariana?â MARIANA. Can I doubt your tutor? The witness you selected for my credence? For your own sake, no more. EDWARD. Do they dare mock me? Brave me in love and vengeance? Let them look to 't. There's not the power in earth or hell I'd shrink from To gain revenge. Farewell; you'll learn to know me Better, I trust. I'll prove to you what I am. [Exit. SCROOPE. Do you not follow your employer, sir? PARALLEL. I pray you, is there no back way? for though He spoke not, yet there are more indications Of wrath, than speechâas first, just such a look As he took leave with. SCROOPE. Step, sir, through the passage; 'Twill lead you to the water side. PARALLEL. I'll take it. For various roads have their conveniences, Which, at your leisure, of my gratitude I will at full discuss to you; but now, For many reasons which shall then and there Be well expounded, I would save my throat Which, one might argue, runs no little hazard If I should tarry longer.âSo, adieu, sir. [Exit. SCROOPE. So, we are free of two of them;âand you, sirâ (to Richard.) RICHARD. I have been to blame to use so little ceremony. Yet must I ask your ear awhile to swear to you, Howe'er it seem against me,âthere's no truth In all the baseness he has taxed me with, Though honour bids me to be silent. SCROOPE. Well, If there be not, you've nought to fear.âI have A certain means to know all. RICHARD. Mariana, You'll not believeâ SCROOPE. She will know all; and you, If you are innocent, I pledge my word. Your fame is clear with both.âDare you abide this? RICHARD. I dare. SCROOPE. Enoughânay look not fearfully I am bound t'ye for an honourable judgment. [Exit Richard. MARIANA. He is slandered, I am sure on't. SCROOPE. Are you so? Then I am sureâBut here is one will tell us. Enter Isabel. You have heard all? ISABEL. I have. SCROOPE. It was a hearing I would you had been spared. ISABEL. Ay, for myself A brother's baseness is a sister's shameâ More, when my name's their theme;âbut I have learnt The necessity of endurance.âMariana, All they have said of Richard is a slander. He refused from me a portion, a mere trifle, Of what remained to me;ânor have I any, The slightest claim, upon his faith, save this, The friendship of a brother and a sister, And, in that friendship, here before your uncle, I tell you, I am sure you have his love, And by mine honour he is worthy yours. I would have you hisâand happy. SCROOPE. Mariana! MARIANA. Uncle! SCROOPE. Ay, you're too happy to say more. Lead in your sister, for she shall be so If she is Richard's sister. I will follow you And bring the jewelsâall but one, which I Have even a better claim to than yourself; Go in my children. [Exeunt Mariana and Isabel. Is my heart so tender After its rough and weather-beaten voyage? That is a noble girl! I was all sternness, And her face won meâ'twas so likeâoh! woman! Man's tutelar to save him from himself, Light of our joys and solace of our griefs, Heaven's masterpiece of heaven's perfectionâlove! Fierce anger and old hate flee from the spell Of thy subduing voice and piteous eye, And leave the heart to thine own charity. Enter William. WILLIAM. So please you, sir, Lord Beaufort would desire Some speech with you, an hour hence. SCROOPE. He is happy To choose his time thusâwell? WILLIAM. And he would know Where you would meet him? here or at his house? SCROOPE. His house! I'll spare his honourâI'll go to him Within this half hour. (Exit William.) Yes, at once I'll end this. Shall my better thoughts be but as the false verdure That clothes a fell volcano? I must quench This EtnaâI'll speak once more with his daughter. [Exit into house. SCENE II. âA Room in a Tavern in Alsatia. Flaw, Bloodmore, Rivers, and Mouseheart, at a Table, drinking, others gaming, &amp;c. FLAW. So, they have turned off poor Will Paston to-day? od's my life! he was a merry roystering rogue! BLOODMORE. Ay, sir, this morning we three stole out to pay our respects at his carting.âAs pretty a man as ever had his neck in a noose!âNo whining, flinching, or blabbing!âDied quite like a gentleman! FLAW. It's odd how one's friends drop off! BLOODMORE. The lawyers, sir! the villanous lawyers! that will not abide by the old adageââLive and let live.â No offence to you, Master Flaw, for I never wish to quarrel but in the way of business: I am too much of a regular, Heaven be praised! to care for any amateur amusement that way. FLAW. Right, sir, right! I'm no lawyer now, you know:âmy uncle confined me once, to be sure, in a set of cobweb'd chambers, with a loaf and a pitcher, like an immured nun; so first I gamed, and lost the little cash I had, then I wrote verses, but nobody would publish them; at last I learned a trick or two on the cardsâcould cog a die or so; that brought me acquainted with you, gentlemen, where I have found that the shortest way for a man who makes too free with his own money is to make free with other people's. BLOODMORE. Yes, you have passed through all the degrees of a cutter.â But, how now, Rivers and Mouseheart, you are sad: I hope the little accident this morning hasn't shaken your nerves.â Death, you know, gentlemen, must happen to every body, and I should think hanging as pleasant as any, if one hadn't the trouble of getting up so early in the morning. RIVERS. I was thinking of the woe-struck girl, that stood Beside me in the crowd,âso pale and thin, With her large speaking eyes, first bent on th' earth, As tho' she shared his shame, then fixed on him, With such a deep, tearless anxiety, Such breathless anguish, until that last moment; And then she fell stone dead into the arms Of the old man! His father and his sister. 'Twas the first time I ever feared to die. FLAW. Did you assist her? RIVERS. I scarce thought myself Fit to console her; and I hopeâI hope She needed no more consolation here. I hope she woke no more in this harsh world. MOUSEHEART. I thought he struggled hard and suffered much. BLOODMORE. Come, gentlemen! Is this conversation to entertain our friend, Flaw, who so liberally imparteth to us? Is this encouragement for a hopeful young gentleman, whose lamented fate and gallant behaviour shall, I hope, be sung in as many ballads as Robin Hood? Is it thus you train youth to glory? Fie upon't! What, we are all born to live; we can't live without means; and if we can't come by them honestly, there is but one other way. FLAW. True, if my uncle, Goldlove, were no curmudgeon, I might be content to be honest. RIVERS. And ifâNo matter! You're right, Bloodmore, we're in for't; so another stoup! and let remorse go look after reflection. BLOODMORE. Ay, that's it! Drink, boys! if it gives you the head-ache, it leaves no room for the heart-ache. Here's Master Flaw, with his love-songs and his braveries, his mistresses and his velvet cloaks, how shall he maintain 'em, sirs, if we instil false principles into his untutored mind? More wine! mine host. FLAW. Ay, to be sure. Wine's like the gout, it cures all other disorders. Enter Edward Beaufort, wrapped in a cloak. EDWARD. Well met, sirs. I am directed to one Bloodmore. BLOODMORE. The watchword, sir, and he may be discovered t'ye. EDWARD. I come from Captain Fang, and by the token âA Tyburn collar squeezes.â BLOODMORE. You're all right, sir, I am your man. EDWARD. Then I have business for you. There is a female, over whom I've rights Must be enforced, and the law's tardy hand Will be too weak. BLOODMORE. I understandâa rape, sir. We're not afraid to call things by their right names Here in Alsatia; 'tis the land of truth, sir. EDWARD. Whyâ BLOODMORE. Never blink it, sir. You want stout fellows, A close concealment, and a well-barred cage, To hold your lady-bird. They're to be had, sir, For money. EDWARD. You are frank. BLOODMORE. It saves us labour, And you, I take it, spare some blushes by it. You seemed ashamed o' th' business; never fear, sir, Here are your men, my party:âWill you sit And grow acquainted? EDWARD. Nay. BLOODMORE. You're too squeamish, sir, They're honest gentlemen, and well brought up too, Too well, indeed; their education 'as taught 'em Nothing but wants. Let's see! Here are four of usâ The matter's perilous, four necks in question, 'Tis worth a hundred pounds, sir. EDWARD. You shall have it. BLOODMORE. And there's the dove-cot we must seek for you, 'Twill cost some twenty moreârisk is run there, too. EDWARD. I'll pay it. BLOODMORE. One half down by way of priming. EDWARD. There's somewhat more. BLOODMORE. You're purse speaks well for you, Though you are given to silence. EDWARD. Meet me, then, To-night at dusk, east of the Temple Gardens; I'll lead you to the spot, but be prepar'd To silence any noise. BLOODMORE. We know our trade, sir; Tut! we're no novices! a gag, a litter, Cords, and a comrade dress'd like a mad doctor, To prove the girl's insane. EDWARD. Tis excellent! BLOODMORE. Common, sir! common! when we are put to shifts We've better tricks.âWe will attend you, sir. EDWARD. Farewell thenâBe you punctual and attentive: I'll keep my promise fully. BLOODMORE. We've security Enough for thatâyour life, sir. Fare you well. (Retires to table.) EDWARD. Why do I pause? Why tremble? I am no cowardâ But yon cold blooded villain! Let me think On Mariana's charmsâRichard's despairâ My triumph o'er their scornâand the rich ransom Old Scroope perchance may pay. I will not perish, Like the poor sorcerer that rais'd the devil, Through my own fears. Courage! The demon serves me. [Exit. BLOODMORE. Then you object to our engaging in this business, Rivers? Wherefore? Use any reasonable argument and we'll hear you. RIVERS. Conscience! BLOODMORE. We've sworn against it. Conscience! The word is treason to our constitution. Say too much risk, or too little profit, or even any gentlemanly feeling of revenge, orâ RIVERS. I've none of these. FLAW. Psha! conscience! I trust I'm above that by this time. I couldn't see his face, but he pays wellâand that's the first virtue in our code of morality. I'll act the doctor. BLOODMORE. Ay, you need not join us till all is secure; the party placed in the litter, and so forth. Your nerves are unpractised, and must not be put to too severe a trial. But for Rivers, I blush for him. MOUSEHEART. In the open street! 'twill be very dangerous. BLOODMORE. The pay is good. We must live, boys. Starve or win it. MOUSEHEART. Ay yetâ BLOODMORE. If you prefer it, Rivers, silence and honour, and you need'nt join us. RIVERS. I claim the cutter's law. I'm of your party. BLOODMORE. Then see you do not flinch, orâyou know me. RIVERS. And you know me.âYou never had cause to doubt me honest to you; and, when your threats are all that bind me, it will be safest to have done with me. BLOODMORE. Come, come, I'm peaceable; you know it. I scorn to throw away an angry look out of the way of trade; and, if it were necessary for our safety, you know I would cut your throat without a word. So we're friends, and understand one another. RIVERS. Perfectly. FLAW. Ay, nothing like a right understanding. Come, gentlemen, I'll go to prepare my disguise. This is almost my first venture; so I'll prime myself with a bottle or two, for I'm not quite so steady as I should be. BLOODMORE. And I'll go sleep off what I have drank. This is a delicate business, and whenever the gallows is in prospect I like to be able to see my road clearly. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âA chamber at Lord Beaufort's. Richard Fitz-Alan and Parallel. RICHARD. Well, I forgive thee. Thou wert born a rascal And bred a tutor: 'tis quite natural That thou shouldst play the villain. PARALLEL. And the debt, too! The fear of prison! RICHARD. True, you are a coward. Another fair excuse. Well, I forgive you. But here comes one with whom I must demand A sterner parley. PARALLEL. Edward! Then I'll leave you. RICHARD. Stay! Stay! PARALLEL. Then you'll protect me? RICHARD. I'll ensure you The chance to run for it. PARALLEL. I'll take courage, then; But let me see that I've fair start of him. Enter Edward. EDWARD. So Richard! you look gloomily upon me. RICHARD. Mine is a gloomy task: you've wronged my honour, EDWARD. Are not both suitors to fair Mariana? Did you not challenge me to this encounter? RICHARD. I did not challenge you with poison'd weapons. EDWARD. Well, well, I was to blameâit was not just. And yet, he far exceeded his instructions. PARALLEL. I pray you now, speak not of me, nor ask me; For, though there be some several sorts of death, It matters not to me if I be spitted Upon his sword or yours, and that's the end on't, Whatever you may force me speak. EDWARD. He hath Foresworn his slanders: you are clear. The thoughtâ The base, degenerate thought Ill call it soâ Rose in my mind, and this fit instrument Forcing himself upon my service in it. PARALLEL. Who? I? RICHARD. Well, he must be forgiven too. EDWARD. Frankly by me, if you can pardon him. RICHARD. I have already. EDWARD. Come, shake hands, then, Parallel! Come, man! [They shake hands: aside to him. You villain! But for once you're safe! You are forgiven freely! Come, let's have A cup of wine. Be gay and jovial: Sit, sit my worthy tutor, and regale. PARALLEL. Sooth! and I will. EDWARD. How fares it with the widow? Richard! It were but just to pay her back A little of the toilsome load she has laid So heavily on your shoulders. Say you wrote A fit reply to that same loving letter She sent this morning an anonymous line Requesting her attendance: she would swear The hand was yours, and Master Parallel Might profit by the opportunity And win a rich wife. What head would this joke Come under, Master Tutor? PARALLEL. If 'twere practicable, The head âjokes advantageous.â RICHARD. Let him write The letter, then. EDWARD. He write a love-letter? Would you spoil all? RICHARD. You'll own the letter, Parallel? 'Tis done, you know, for your sake. PARALLEL. Own the letter? Ay, truly would I, and for many reasons. First, my own interestâ EDWARD. That one suffices: Here are pens, ink, and paper. [Richard writes. Is't not kind of me, After your tricks, to find a wife for you? PARALLEL. Nay, don't talk of my tricks. EDWARD. I spoke of them In mirth. PARALLEL. But your mirth's somewhat terrible, Rather like grinning death upon a tombstoneâ A gay âmemento mori.â EDWARD. Psha! The widowâ Think of the brave rich widow, she's your mark, man! RICHARD. I've scrawled a line or two. EDWARD. Let Master Parallel Hear how you speak for him, and frame his tongue to it. RICHARD. (reads.) Mistress, one will wait to-night, In the quiet evening light, On the terrace near your dwelling: When love's orb begins to reign, Come and list to him who'd fain Of his heart the tale be telling. There's a good halting doggrel muse for you. Stay, âTo the Widow Lovel.â EDWARD. Hold! 'twere better Not to direct it. Even if the hand Be known, you then can say 'tis but a scrawl Missent where 'twas not due. RICHARD. E'en as you please. EDWARD. Our stoup is out. Another flask? RICHARD. Nay, hold,â No more to-day; here's Master Parallel Must make him ready for his love encounter. EDWARD. I'll send his verses. RICHARD. Now, my worthy pupil, Now for your master's honour go and prosper. [Exit. PARALLEL. I will read Ovid to refresh my mind With pleasing images, and cast an eye O'er Horace for a little mirthâAnacreon And SapphoâLove indeed's the noblest use Of learning. She shall have a specimen Of the true classic wooing. [Exit. EDWARD. When you find her. This precious fragment is for higher uses, Than to procure your meeting with the widow 'Tis Richard's hand, and known to Mariana; A lure that sweet bird will full gladly stoop to. [Isabel has entered during the speech, and taken up the paper.] Ha, Isabel! ISABEL. Verses in Richard's hand! What would you with them, brother? EDWARD. Tut! a toy, A jest! ISABEL. You seldom jest, good Edward: now Methinks 'tis no time for it. EDWARD. Give them me, Or you will spoil the mirth I'd make with them. ISABEL. The mirth! I doubt you, brother. I have seen But now a sorry token of your jesting. You are a suitor, too, to Mariana; And, foil'd, I know your temper; but I'll watch To save them from your wiles, you from yourself. [Exit. SCENE IV. âAn Apartment at Beaufort's. Enter Lord Beaufort, followed by a Servant. LORD BEAUFORT. I'll see him here, and while we are together Let no one interrupt us. (Exit Servant.) For the first time, To ask, and of a merchant! one to whom Wealth is the all in all; whose trade's oppression, By all the various means of craft and usury. Who hath no passion but his gold; no sympathy Save with the means of gain! Well, I must meet him. Enter Scroope (he keeps his face averted.) He stands with such a tradesman-like humility, Hypocrisy so crawling, serpent-like; I loathe it more than the imperious pride That lurks beneath. You hold a mortgage, sir, Over my house and lands here, which expires Even as we speak, perhaps? Why are you silent? You have it, have you not? SCROOPE. I have. LORD BEAUFORT. Methinks I have heard that voice before. How's this? you tremble? SCROOPE. Do I indeed? (Aside.) I do feel the bird That looks upon the rattle-snake. What would you Propose or offer? LORD BEAUFORT. Nothing; my whole wealth Is at your mercy, or indeed 'tis yours: The wreck, by careful nursery, might yield A slender pittance, such as would support Mean life, and that I scarce can ask of you. SCROOPE. Why do you send for me? To ask compassion? LORD BEAUFORT. Sir, spare your insult and begone! SCROOPE. Why should I? You say this house is mine. Why sent you to me If not to ask compassion? LORD BEAUFORT. I might hope My creditor might have so much of conscience, To save all needless charges, and perchance To pay me the small value of my lands, Above the mortgage. SCROOPE. And from whom could you Expect this favour? LORD BEAUFORT. Even from a stranger. SCROOPE. But I am not a stranger? You have heard My voice before. LORD BEAUFORT. Yet cannot recollect Where I have heard it; though some mournful thoughts Rise in its accents. SCROOPE. Look upon my face! 'Tis more than twenty years since you beheld it; Ay, some years more than twentyâyet, methinks, You should not have forgotten.â LORD BEAUFORT. It is he! SCROOPE. Ay; do you know me? Does Lord Beaufort send To Francis Norton? Would you ask of him Favour or friendship, or mere charity? LORD BEAUFORT. And am I in your power? SCROOPE. Ay: for years I've wormed myself, by fine degrees, to the heart Of your once proud fortunes: I have thrown the means Of waste within your way: when you shot forth Unhealthy branches of expenditure I still supplied the sap: but there I dwelt, Near to the core, eating and eating still The strength of the trunk away, till my slow patience At length hath felled it. LORD BEAUFORT. Fool! that I knew you not. These five years you have lived here. SCROOPE. Aye! I came To keep a steward's eye o'er my estate And watch its heedless tenants. Now you know me What can you ask of me, I cannot answer, Out of your own mouth, with a stern denial? Is there a common tie of man to man, Such as the Arab of the desert owns When e'en an enemy of his faith craves shelter, You have not broke between us? Now, what ask you? LORD BEAUFORT. Nothing. Your fate has conquered, and I'm lost. SCROOPE. I came not here to triumph, but to judge. I've lived to see you at my feet: deny't not! For all your outward pride is but the symbol Of your heart's quailingâI have lived to see this, And I am satisfied. I've little cause To spare you, but for her sake, whom you killed, And for some others who are near to you, You shall at least have justice. For the terms, Within an hour send Richard to my house Richard Fitz-AlanâI will hear no more. Awaken not the deadly fiends that struggle Yet into life within my breast. Send him, And in my better mood, amid those thoughts That cleanse the heart of vengeful will, perchance Your fortunes may fare betterâsend him to me. [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe parlour of Scroope's house. Enter Scroope. SCROOPE. Yes, this is my revenge upon the world, Before whose tyranny my fervent youth Fainted: they shall be happy. It shall not, As it hath done from mine, wrench out, deep torture! The fondest charities from the best years Of their hearts' life. No, they shall spurn the world That loves to spurn the lowlyâthat base world That cheers its valiant hunters on the hare And throws a shield before the lordly lion; That vile, that parasite world, that knows not merit Save in prosperity, high birth, or wealth Its very charters of monopoly In all its paltry ventures. They, at least, Shall not become its victims. He is here. Enter Richard. Welcome! I've much to say to you. You come From the Lord Beaufort; he hath bid you seek me? RICHARD. I come, by his command, to know your will, sir, And, if I may, to plead for him. SCROOPE. I'll hear you. You know I have mortgage on his lands Not far short of their value, and this hour I may seize on them as forfeit: wherefore should I Refrain from my just rights? RICHARD. For charity Lest he should lack the very means of life. SCROOPE. For many years I've sought to gain this power: Be you the judge whether I should forego it. RICHARD. I am his wardâalmost his son. SCROOPE. You'll judge him More kindly? Well! Even kindly be it then! If 'twere a common cause of man and man, With nought but natural human rights between us, You should go hence at once, and with your suit; But I've some claim for vengeance. RICHARD. He is fallen! A brave arm sinks before a prostrate foe. SCROOPE. You're right to urge it. Yet, with you, methinks, There is a chord of the heart that I might touch, And that should sound âRevenge:â for you can loveâ RICHARD. SirâIâ SCROOPE. Ne'er falter! You do love? RICHARD. I do. It is my hope, my pride, my glory. SCROOPE. Ay; If one should wrong you past the power of pardon, Might it not be that he should sting you there? RICHARD. He tore your's from you? SCROOPE. More. Doom'd her to die. In the freshness of young hope, and fervent joy, And vital love, consign'd her to the tomb. RICHARD. Lord Beaufort did this! SCROOPE. Ay. You do not plead for him. RICHARD. 'Tis well there is a mercy in the heavens Beyond what man can show, or frame, or fathom! SCROOPE. Calmly! You are to judge. Listen, and patiently! I am the son of one who tenanted An humble dwelling on Lord Beaufort's land. I was a thoughtful, musing, pensive child, Apter to read than labour, and my parents Strove hard to gain the means of study for me. The old Lord Beaufort aided them, though slightly; You have seen such patronage. My mind expanded. I looked on nature and the beings round me A reasoning, feeling man: but how I reason'd And how I felt are bitter memories to me. RICHARD. Bitter! The young fresh blossoms of the soul Expanding into charity and wisdom! SCROOPE. No, no; the blight that cankered them. Lord Beaufort Had mark'd my studious temper. Village fame Lauded me high. He sent for me, he prais'd me, Made me companion of his son and daughterâ Their tutor. RICHARD. This Lord Beaufort and his sister? SCROOPE. The same. He little read or thought, but she Lov'd poesy's ideal worldâthe lore Of high enthusiasts. She was beautiful, As youth is ever ere it looks on care; Generous, frank, high-minded above pride, As youth is ever ere it knows of wrong; Full of imagination's noblest dreams, As youth is ever ere it reads sad truth. RICHARD. You lov'd her? SCROOPE. What? The daughter of a lord! And I a peasant! think you I dar'd love her? RICHARD. What home had each for nature's holiest thoughts Save the other's heart? The mighty sympathies Which dare appeal to heaven for their birth Are of too proud a lineage to bow Before earth's idols. SCROOPE. So we argued not, But so we felt. Young Beaufort left us for The court, and, save her father, we were alone. That solitude! that happy solitude! When all else is intrusion, bound the chain Closer and closer round us. To be brief, We dar'd to wed in secret. RICHARD. Perilous joy! SCROOPE. Had you not done so? Say a heart were yours, Fondly, entirely yours, no other hopeâ? RICHARD. I would strive to think for her. SCROOPE. You would do well. But if she, all abandoned to her love, Pleadedâand both so youngâ? RICHARD. So fond! to wed Or say âfarewellâ for ever! SCROOPE. We both thought so. RICHARD. Love, then, is fate and fortune and eternity. SCROOPE. The old Lord Beaufort died; his son return'd. Still were we silent, for stolen love is timorous, And Beaufort was an alter'd man: the court Had taught the value of his rank and station. He was now a proud peer, I, his poor dependant. At length a disappointed traitor told him The tale of my presumption, and his anger Paus'd but to seize a weapon of destruction To crush the wretch who brav'd it. RICHARD. This Lord Beaufort! SCROOPE. He! he! 'twas then the reign of bigotry And iron persecution; Mary rul'd. Beaufort was Catholic, he knew my faith, Denounc'd me as a heretic and traitor, 'Twas subtle cruelty, a taint o' th' plague That might infect all that I lov'd and cherish'd, RICHARD. And she? SCROOPE. I fled from her lest she should fall Beneath the accursed bane of heresy. RICHARD. It was a subtle cruelty. But sheâ SCROOPE. To keep that life, which, while I liv'd, she priz'd To 'scape the persecution of a brother, Who else had sated his proud indignation With axe or flame, a convent's walls received her, And there, from me her love and life were seal'd; I know but that she died. RICHARD. Poor sacrifice! SCROOPE. Indeed a sacrifice of innocence To the Moloch of human pride! Oh, that warm heart, Those fond affections, barr'd from all communion With hope and joy, the very elements Of her sweet life perishing, what could she do but die? And to this lingering death did Beaufort doom her; 'Tis for this man you now ask my compassion. RICHARD. I yet must ask though I may scarcely hope. SCROOPE. I bid him send you to me; there is hope. There are vile agents for the viler purposes Of base oppression and of legal ruin: I would not so employ you. I forgive him. I pray to heaven this may be the last shock To that meek charity which best befits Men's helpless frailty. His estates are free; The mortgage you shall have ere you depart With my free will to cancel it, and she, Even in blessedness, will smile to see That act,âI feel it. RICHARD. 'Tis a blessed act On which the heav'nliest spirit might look down, Nor dim its joy celestial. SCROOPE. We've dispatch'd Our sadder task; yet, though Lord Beaufort wait, His messenger must stay while I achieve The story of my life. For some time, void Of present and of future, the sad past Made up existence: but my sister died, And left to my sole care an orphan niece. Grief hath a consolation in its fancies: In Mariana's eyes I lov'd to trace The expression of my Catherine's; in her voice, With all its lisping, childish tenderness, I still sought for some tone of Catherine's; But most in the child's gentleness and kindness, I treasur'd up my thoughts of Catherine's soul. Thus was I warm'd to sad but gentle wishes That her fate might be happier. Again I dreamt The vision of young life in cherishing her. I toiled and prosperedâtoiled again and throve, Till I was rich, for her sake, and I now Would crown a heart heav'n fram'd for happiness With its own best wishes. You love Mariana? Speak! I would hear you say so. RICHARD. It were cowardice Now to be tongue-tied; tell me but the means By which I e'er may win her, not deserve her, That I hope not, but point me out the peril, On which I burn to rush, would gain her hand, Or even the vile servitude, the drudgery, Cheer'd by the hope that she may yet be mine, And let me prove I am not a mere boaster: I will do that should prove me, though unworthy, Yet sensible, at least, of such a blessing. SCROOPE. Words! words! I'll put you to the proof. May a life Of peace and love bear witness for your heart. You shall see how I believe you. [Exit. RICHARD. What new pain's this? I have met peril, laughed at poverty, But kindness so unmerited!âBy your leave Good manhood! If a tear will gush it must. Joy struggles with my very life. My heart Choaks in my throat. Re-enter Scroope. Where is she? SCROOPE. Know you not? She is not there and on the table lay This paper. 'Tis your hand. RICHARD. It is indeed. SCROOPE. Why, what is't ails you? Seek her on the terrace Come, I can pardon this. RICHARD. Oh, never! never! If this be as I fear, I ask no pardon, I'm too accursed a villain to dare hope it. Mariana! (rushes out.) SCROOPE. What means this? What thunder-cloud Hath burst upon him and yet hangs o'er me Ready to blast me? RICHARD (without.) Mariana! SCROOPE. Hark! He calls her, but no voice responds! RICHARD (without.) Mariana! SCROOPE. All's silent! Sure my very heart is withering! I cannot breathe. Richard (re-enters.) RICHARD. She's gone! SCROOPE. By heaven's judgment! I do adjure thee! Speak! RICHARD. May every curse, More terrible than vengeance can devise, Light on young Beaufort's head! SCROOPE. Wherefore? RICHARD. This paper! He gain'd it from me:âoh! that my hand had rotted Ere I had written it!âfor an idle purpose. He saidâoh! lie, forged in the blackest hell!â He hath robbed me of her with it! SCROOPE. Dared'st thou traffic With him for Mariana? If thou hastâ RICHARD. Hold! On my soul not so. Do not you curse me! I know you've cause, yet, on my knees, I pray you Spare me, if but for vengeance on that villain. SCROOPE. Ay, vengeance, instant vengeance upon all! My Mariana! oh, what wretched purpose Had'st thou in writing this? RICHARD. A mean, base jest, But not on her. Oh, had I thought on her Thenâ SCROOPE. Idle fool! to trifle with thy fortune, Now on its topmost round, thou'rt crushed indeed If I but find one evil thought towards her, One little, idle slight within thy soul. Oh! let me think! My brain throbs so; Yes! vengeance upon all! They're in my power! Ho! there. Enter William and Thomas. Call me officers! Bring forth those bonds and papers! I'm their master! Bid them make seizure on Lord Beaufort's house! [Exit Thomas. Send thou to Flint, the lawyer: if to-night They lie not in the prisonâwhich, I pray, May hold them everâI'm no more his client. Call men and send to every streetâeach houseâ To enquire my Mariana forth! I'll make A fortune for a duke to him that finds her! Away! How dar'st thou tarry? (Exit William.) Wretch that I am! What can I do? RICHARD. Hear me! SCROOPE. Thy voice is hateful! Oh! how I lov'd and trusted thee, and built My hopes upon thy happiness and hers! RICHARD. For her sake, hear me! I have but one thoughtâ To rescue her; grant me an hour to try this, And, if I fail, I'll gladly yield myself To prisonâfettersâdeath! If she be lost, I'll bless you for revenging her on me! SCROOPE. Go.âI'll try to believe thee. RICHARD. Thanks! let not your curse be heaped upon me: Pray for my good success. [Exit Richard. SCROOPE. I'll seek her at Lord Beaufort's; if she's lost What have I left to bind me to my kind? I'll hold a revel of revenge and misery And that proud house shall be my court. My gold, I bless thee for my power. I have them all! The light of goodness shuns me: darkness and evil Have, too, their festivals; and mine shall be As terrible as his, th' arch-fiend's, where groans Re-echoe round his burning throne, and torture Teaches him torture. In my heart's a fire To scorch up all around. Oh, my poor child. [Exit. SCENE II. âA room in Alsatia. One window high above the floor, and grated. The whole miserable and squalid. Edward and an Old Woman. EDWARD. 'Tis wellâ'tis wellâgo leave me. OLD WOMAN. Therefore, sir, If you would have ought moreâ EDWARD. I prythee go. There is a noiseâ'tis theyâaway, old crone. [Exit Old Woman. Sin must be sweet to make me bear with such As I've encounter'd here.âYet, in my state, This is a golden fortune. Say I wed herâ And that, methinks, is my best policyâ My wealth shall laugh at the poor envious fools Who sneer at such alliance. Wife or mistress, She shall be mineâand let her wisdom choose. They're here! Enter Bloodmore, Mouseheart, and Rivers, with Mariana. Edward for a moment retires. MARIANA. Oh! are ye men? and have ye never known One tender tie of love to woman? Sons, Brothers, or lovers? Sure there is some touch Of pity in your hearts. BLOODMORE. We have forgotten Such matters where they interfere with business. MARIANA. Can man look on a woman's tears with scorn? A helpless, unoffending, innocent woman? Would you have wealth? There's one shall buy your souls Yet from this deep perditionâgive you gold Enough to make your lives joyfully honest Even to long old age. What would you of me? BLOODMORE. We're paid, and we must do our duty, lady. Honest, forsooth! We should be precious rogues To take the money and then sell the service. Who do you think would trust us? MARIANA. Woe is me! What can I sayâwhat offerâor how plead? What would you with me? (Edward comes forward.) Oh! sir, are you here? I read your black designs. I do conjure you, If you have but one human feeling left, If ye'd not have your mothers' spirits curse you, At the least kill me in mine honesty. There is a fate is worse than death to woman, And I implore you, by your parents' graves, Release me but from that. EDWARD. Stay, Marianaâ And fear me not: the means are rough indeed I've used to woo you; yet, if you are wise, You have no cause for fear. MARIANA. What wisdom, sir, Is it that you would teach me? EDWARD. Friends, your leave. I love you, Mariana, and would wed you. MARIANA. Love me! EDWARD. You know not your own charms to doubt it. MARIANA. A courtly flattery for such a place! Love me!âalas, sir, know you what love is? Love perils lifeâand glories in the martyrdomâ To spare one blush on the beloved's cheek, To calm one throb of anguish in her heart. And say you that you love me?âfie, sir, fie! EDWARD. We will not cavil now on words. I'd wed you: If you consent 'tis well; if not, fine mistress, You may live to wish you had not sold yourself Upon worse terms: the bargain's in my hands, And, one way or the other, you yourself Shall be the ransomâ MARIANA. Is't my uncle's wealth That tempts you?âhe will gladly lay it down, Allâto the uttermost farthing, but to save me; We'll both be poor and bless you. Do not mock me, To say you love meâit is needless. Speak! And by my soul, all you can ask of him Shall be most freely granted, and yourself Pardon'd and free from blame. EDWARD. I were most wise To trust your word in that; but once my wife, And I am safeâ MARIANA. Your wife! EDWARD. Ay, or my minion; You see I am no trifler. Is't a match? MARIANA. I am in your power; yet heaven looks not idly Upon the world; in that name I defy you. I am a woman, strengthless and unarmed, Encircled by remorseless fiends, as savage As the untutor'd cannibal, who owns No language that speaks pity!âbut I kneel, And firmly place my trust there, in my agony. EDWARD. Fool! you have chosenâ(noise without.) MARIANA. Hark! a breath can scare you. Look! on each face sit guilt and pallid fear! Open yon door, and let me pass: I'll save you! Flaw enters drunk, in the habit of a physician. EDWARD. What foolery is this? FLAW. Foolery! I'm a fool-catcher nowâa physician; a knave âno fool; i'faith, you may stare indeed, for I'm somewhat metamorphosed in person and understandingâas it were, doubly disguisedâin dress and in liquor! But what! we be lads of spirit! BLOODMORE. How now, Master Flaw! Shame on such doings! MARIANA. Flawâha!âgood Master Flawâoh save me, help me! Have you no company? FLAW. What, Mariana! Have I been helping them to carry off My own intended wife! I'm not quite sober, Or else a precious assâor perhaps bothâ Butâ BLOODMORE. Come, begone; I blush this worthy gentleman Should see such manners. What must he think of us? FLAW. I'll not begoneâ BLOODMORE. Not. FLAW. Pishâthat for your sword; I've got one somewhereâhere it is at last, She is my love, and by true cutter's law, And civil lawâand martial law, if need be, I will defend her. MARIANA. Have you no friends, sir? FLAW. Friendsânever fearâget you behind yon basket, And then have at you fellows. MARIANA. Oh, for pity, Harm him not. (They overpower Flaw.) FLAW. I'm not hurt. BLOODMORE. Give me yon cord And bind him tight. FLAW. You'll cut my arms in two. BLOODMORE. I'll cut your throat directly.âNow, sirs, speak, I think 'twere best for our security We should despatch this drunken fool at once. EDWARD. Hold! hold! no murder. FLAW. Let 'em murder me, I shall see the day they'll pay for it. EDWARD. Silence, foolâ Bind him and keep him fastâno moreâI charge you, Harm him no further. BLOODMORE. Oh! I bear no malice; But a keen blade just drawn across the throat Is such a stop to awkward evidence, It cheats the law so neatlyâand he merits it For making this unseemly brawl. EDWARD. No matter. BLOODMORE. Then tie his legs and throw him in the basket; When the lad's sober he's a civil spoken And proper youthâand like some day to prove An honour to the gallowsâ'tis a pity A hopeful boy should run out of the course thus. FLAW (As they tie him and put him in the basket.) You rascalsâgive me my sweet loveâI die A hero and a lover. Cut my throat! When? scoundrelsâwhen? it was'nt made for cutting. I fall in virtue's causeâand perish nobly. BLOODMORE. There you may sleepâ FLAW. Good night to all the world: Marianaâoh, my stomach!âoh, my love! EDWARD. So much for your chivalrous rescuerâ Bethink you better of your fortunes, lady. For a short time I'll leave you under guard: When I return I hope to find you wiser. You, good sirâcome with meâI have some business In which you yet may aid me. Dare we leave Her in this custody. BLOODMORE. Ay: fear not that, sir, We'll lock the outer door, EDWARD. Lady! be wise. [Exit Edward and Bloodmore. MARIANA. All hope of rescue lost. Hath heaven no pity? Will you not help meâspeak? MOUSEHEART. I dare not, lady. MARIANA. And you, you will not look upon me? RIVERS. Silence! I know my duty, and I must perform it. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âStreet. Enter Richard. Nor himânor her! and my short respite passes Like the last hour of a poor culprit's life, That waits the executioner. Yet 'tis not Myself I heed; let me wear out my life The tenant of a prisonâI deserve it! But she, the beautiful! the innocent! She who placed all her trust, her love, on me, To be the victim of my folly!âHa! Who passes there? 'Tis he! I'll rushâNo, no; Patienceâa moment's patienceâlest he 'scape me.

Had not my father Commanded my attendance, I'd not spar'd One instant from the affair that calls on me. RICHARD. It is an earnest one. Where is she? EDWARD. Who? RICHARD. Mariana!âSpeak! EDWARD. You rave. RICHARD. Tear from the wolf Her young and strive to parley; but dare not Trifle with me. Where is she? EDWARD. You are jesting! Farewell! RICHARD. To stir a step is death! EDWARD. Ha! ha! Go! order thine inferior, if thou hast one, To search her out; for me, I am no lacquey To obey a foundling page, or watch the steps Of a base usurer's niece. RICHARD. We are man to man now! And well thou know'st thy life is at my will, If thou durst meet my sword in manly conflictâ Brave heaven's fierce lightnings with thy pride of birth! Wert thou a king, and I thy meanest slave My wrath would spurn thy rank.âWhere is my bride? She should have been soâthou, and none but thou, Hast torn herânay, hast basely stolen her from me. Thy life, or mine, or both, are on the stake. EDWARD. If I had knownâ RICHARD. Coward! speak not the lie, Lest I should strangle it in thy foul throat! The letter that thou urged'st me to writeâ Thy base equivocationsâall proclaim it. Yield her, or meet thy death! EDWARD. From thee? RICHARD. From me! Yield herâbut yield her to her father's arms, And I will cast me at thy feet and bless thee: I'll beg of him forgiveness for theeânay, I'll yield her to thee, win her father's blessing Upon your union, doom myself to banishment; Let me but wipe the foul stain from my soul, That I've dishonour'd her who trusted me! EDWARD. I am a fool to listen to thy ravings. Stand from before meâI will passâ RICHARD. Then be it so! (draws.) Here let me perish if I slay thee not! Draw!âtraitor to thy friend!âpoor, paltry villain! Draw!âor I will not spare thee!â [Edward draws. They fight. Richard attacking Edward with uncontrolled and wild fury. Edward defends himself coolly, and at length disarms and wounds Richard. EDWARD.

But that I think thou can'st not, or I'll end Thy folly and presumption at a blow! [Exit. RICHARD (supporting himself against a pillar). I have no strength to follow him.

Ho! friends, Help, for heaven's charity! help! help! Enter two Officers. FIRST OFFICER. You're hurt, sir. Let us convey him straight into a house, For we have urgent business. Edward Beaufort. RICHARD. What of him? FIRST OFFICER. We must straight attach his person. RICHARD. Leave me! he's yonder! fly! leave me! I'm strong.

Where is my daughter? SERVANT. She, too, is gone, my lord. LORD BEAUFORT. Do all desert me? At such a time, methinks, my children's place Should be their father's side. Who is't comes yonder? SERVANT. I think, my lord, 'tis Scroope. LORD BEAUFORT. Then leave me with him. [Exit Servant. I feel him with the instinct which the sparrow Hath of the hawk. I feel that it is he. Yet not the Scroope I met this morning here, 'Tis liker Francis Norton Twenty-five years ago; his step so hasty, His eye so quick and proud. SCROOPE (without.) Away, sir! hence! I'm master here, and, in my house, I need not To be announced. How dar'st thou look thus on me? I say I am master here. (Enters.) LORD BEAUFORT. What means this, sir? SCROOPE. Must I be heralded into a den Of wolves? It means that you are in my power And you shall feel you are so. Wrong on wrong You and your house have heap'd upon me. A nest Of serpents! race of fiends! whose very sport Is the heart's torture! LORD BEAUFORT. What passion's this? SCROOPE. What passion? Say the eagle's for his mate, Whom you have slain, and from whose nest you've stolen His young; 'twill poorly paint my anguish'd wrath Or my swift vengeance. Ye shall feel me, proud ones! LORD BEAUFORT. Hear me! SCROOPE. Ay, groaning with remorse and hunger When you and all are cast forth from your dwelling, To feelâthere is no keener fate, and you Have practis'd it on meâthe hard world's scorn, Its arrogant, proud pity, its advice For what is past. Even I cannot desire Bitterer mocks, more biting, poignant taunts, More mean and abject, heart-corroding sorrows, Than shall attend your fall'n nobility. Daily I'll comeânay hourly, to the prison Where I'll consign your son, and hear the moans Of his proud kindred in their squalid rags, Whose greatness hath no more to yield him. Then, Then I may smile once more, for you have left me No other joy but in your misery. LORD BEAUFORT. Yet let me know what new offence? I'm innocentâ SCROOPE. You are his father. 'Tis enough from you He hath inherited the accursed nature To feel but for himself: and he shall feel! To dwell with Beaufort is to learn to murder, Wantonly murder! There's a pestilence Among ye, and you should be all pent up In a foul lazar-house: your breath is poison; Even your page, Fitz-Alan, whom I loved, Is made an instrument of wrong to me: And for your sonâ Enter an Officer. How now, sir! Have you search'd? Say, are they here? OFFICER. Neither, sir. SCROOPE. Mariana! Where shall I seek her! Oh, my peerless child! Yet I'll avenge! You have doom'd yourselves. Hence from my house! my house! And beg ere nightfall for a beggar's shelter. [Edward is brought on guarded by the two Officers.] Ha! art thou here? Thank heaven! Mariana! Tell me! Where is she? EDWARD. I'm a prisoner, sir, But not your slave. Ask those will answer you. SCROOPE. Thou wilt not tell me? I could seize thee, villain, And rend thee as the lion doth his prey; But thou'rt too far beneath me, thou'rt too firmly, Too surely in my power. I will make An art of torturing thee. Fool! thou art here Within my grasp, and at my will I crush thee. One word decides thy fate. Where's Mariana? EDWARD. Had I my freedom, I would answer thee. My sword should tell thee, as it told Fitz-Alan, How little I regard thee or thy threats. LORD BEAUFORT. What! is he slain? By thee! Indeed, all's lost. SCROOPE. Thy spirit's pamper'd now. Answer me thus When a slow year of prison hath consum'd it. EDWARD. Lead me to prison, sirs. Why have you brought me Before this self-appointed judge, to plead To what concerns not me? You shall well answer For making me the sport of his wild fancies. How dare ye treat me as a criminal On his false accusation? SCROOPE. See! the writing Which thou didst gain from him thou call'dst thy friend! Let that confound thee! Let that bar all hope! Thou art my debtor! Ah, my wealth, I praise thee! And for a sum that will, I think, detain thee Until I forge for thee a felon's fetters And lead thee to the gibbet! Aye, the gibbet! Let thy birth render that illustrious! Enter Richard, pale and breathless, his arm bound. RICHARD. Though with my last breath, let me pay my debt, The debt of vengeance; I am come to yield Myself your prisoner, sir. LORD BEAUFORT. Doth he yet live? Then is there left a hope. SCROOPE. Poor heart-struck victim! I almost pity thee. EDWARD. Lead me away. SCROOPE. Let him remain! I'll answer to the law For what I do. That felon shall remain. For the Lord Beaufort and his household, hence! Away with them! To beg! to starve! to die! LORD BEAUFORT. One moment! I may yet awake one chord Of mercy in thy breast. SCROOPE. Ha! ha! my breast! 'Tis flint! 'tis adamant! a tower of rock, Where hate and vengeance keep their citadel. LORD BEAUFORT. My sister!âthine own wifeâ SCROOPE. I tremble, but With deeper rage. LORD BEAUFORT. If it be so, despair Is brave. Thy wife, I say, my sister, ere She died, became a mother, and there lives One who may call thee âFather.â I alone Can tell thee of thy offspring, 'tis a claim I have acknowledged yet to none, for pride Bade me first keep it secret; and this day, In the same pride, I hop'd I might repay All thou could'st show of mercy. Tell me, sir, Who is the master now? SCROOPE. I am at thy feet. Oh! tell me! does my heart?âAm I deceived? Is he not here? Speak! All that thou canst ask Is thine. I swear it. LORD BEAUFORT. Richard is thy son! SCROOPE. He swoons within my arms! Oh my lost boy! Dear relic of thy mother! my poor child! Do I embrace thee but to lose thee! Ha! Thank heaven! he looks up! my boy! my son! Look to his wound! RICHARD. My father! Fear not for me! 'Tis but a moment's weakness. It was bound By a hand of kindest ministry! Fear not! But when I felt I liv'd, I could but live For you and Mariana, and no power Had held me hence. SCROOPE. I ever lov'd thee, Richard; But now what joy to trace thy mother's smile Beam on thy face. RICHARD. Oh! were this joy but shar'd With Mariana! Enter Flaw. FLAW. Good master Scroope! huzza! Throw up your cap, sir! I'm the deliverer! huzza! shout all! I am the hero, sir, the valiant hero, Who hath run faster than e'er hero ran. To bring the tidingsâ SCROOPE. What, man? FLAW. Look you here! Your niece, sir! Enter Mariana and Rivers. SCROOPE. Safe! art safe? art safe, my child? Unstain'd? unharm'd? MARIANA. Safe and unharm'd, dear uncle! SCROOPE. Who hath preserved thee? Who was it hath wronged thee? Yet that I knowâI'm sure. Oh my full heart! Behold my son! thy husband, Mariana! Richard, thy lover! All is joy and wonder, And I have only tears to tell the story; Oh, my dear children! MARIANA. 'Tis one dream of rapture! Yet true, I feel it. RICHARD. Mariana! mine! My restor'd bride! SCROOPE. Ay, fold her in your arms, My heart yearns as 'twould burst to hold you in it. My son and daughter! Look you here, proud sir! (to Edward.) Yet I'm so happy that I would not triumph Over the guiltiest. MARIANA. Know, sir, my preservers; These gentlemen, whose faults you must forgive, And recompense their virtues. RIVERS. I am recompensed; I have not breath'd for many years so freely. SCROOPE. And you too, Master Flaw? FLAW. Ay, even I, sir; I've pepper'd some of my associates, Bled Master Bloodmore, frighted valiant Mouseheart: To do him justice though, my brave ally, Good Master Rivers here, unbound me first, And now, to emulate Scipio Africanus, I freely yield my conquest to my rival. RICHARD. And he's as grateful as was Scipio's client. FLAW. Yet there was one, a figure in a cloak, Who, with two valiant fellows, watch'd to aid us; And, though he drew no sword himself, his followers Help'd us to beat the rascals that opposed us, And sure that's like himâonly that's a woman. Enter Isabel. ISABEL. Yes, 'tis a woman! Richard! 'tis thy sister! Say, have I acted still a sister's part? I promis'd ne'er to speak of what I fear'd, But 'twere no womanhood to know thy bride In such base toils, and strive not to release her. RICHARD. How shall I thank thee? MARIANA. I? SCROOPE. That task is mine. I know what you would ask, yet pause awhileâ I only know your wishes to prevent them. SCROOPE. Now, sir, though (to Edward) You're in your father's treaty pardon'd, yet I would befriend you better than your vices, If you would quit them for a juster counsel. EDWARD. Sir, I ask nothing. I am still your captive. SCROOPE. No, you are free, release him. (Exeunt Officers.) EDWARD. There are regions Yet unexplor'd on earth; there I'll essay To regain a fame I've forfeited. Farewell, sir, (To Lord Beaufort.) If you again should hear of Edward Beaufort, It may be that he has perish'd, or done that May merit kinder thoughts. Seek not to stay me. [Exit. SCROOPE. He shall be aided in his enterprise. Give me your hand, my brother, will you not? Is not all enmity at rest between us? LORD BEAUFORT. With me most truly. SCROOPE. Take your house and lands, They are Richard's gift unto his noble uncle, And Mariana's offering to her sister. What says my son? What joy to call thee so! RICHARD. You grant me favours ere I ask them, sir. SCROOPE. You will be rich enough, and Mariana Will yet lose no part of her dowry, you Sharing it with her. MARIANA. Every way increas'd, sir, In love and dear content. SCROOPE. Bless you, my children; And you (to Isabel) a new-adopted daughter to me. Now may I well rejoice in my wealth's power. My gold, again I thank thee. May such fortune Still crown the just thrift of The London Merchant. THE END.</field>
