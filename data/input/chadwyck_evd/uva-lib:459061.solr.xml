For when you but survey the narrow wayes We walke in, you will find, we could not raise From a few Seamen, wind-bound in a Port, More various changes, business, or more sport.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. [SCENE I.] Enter Seawit, Topsaile, Cable. Seawit. The Wind still Southerly? here we are like To stay till grass grow on our Decks; and all Our Masts take root, bud forth too and beare Akornes, Which (as I take't) my Salt-Sea friends, is like To be our food when all our victual's spent. How thrives your treasure Cable? when your looks Are heavy, we shall need small Magick to Divine your Pockets light. Cable. A few Mild-Sixpences, with which My Purser casts accompt, is all I've left. Topsaile. There are ith'Harbour Sir, those of the faithfull That will trust, upon a good pawne, you must Ingage your Plate. Sea. His Plate! alass! poor Soule, What Plate hath he more then his Boatswaines Whistle. As for the Silver Seale, that hung at's wrist, Whereon was carv'd the Lovers Scutchions Sir, (The bleeding Heart) that's gone long since t'adorne His Mistress Court Cubboard, which on a cloth Of Network edg'd with a Ten-penny-Lace, Stands now between her Thimble and her Bodkin; Objects of State (believ't) and Ornament. Cable. This Town is dearer then Jerusalem, After a years Siege; they would make us pay For day-light, if they know to measure The Sun-beames by the Yard. Nay sell the very Aire too if they could serve it out in fine China-Bottels. If you walk but three turnes In the High-street, they will ask you Mony For wearing out the Pebles. Seawit. This is your Region Topsaile, for you Seamen Love to converse of plenty, where you may Be cous'ned for your ware, and meat, and think Such negligence becomes a noble spirit, As well as Thrift a leane Atturney, or Fat Alderman, untill your Mercer and Your Man that squeezes your lusty Wine of Greece, Or brisk Vin-Dy, remove from's smoky habitation In the Towne, unto your Mannour House? There ride in triumph o're your conquer'd Land, As if he did bestride my Lord Mayors horse, As if your Meadows were Cheap-side, and all Your Woods the just precincts of his own Ward. Cable. And these two Disciples to St. Tantlin, That rise to long exercise before day, And cousen'd soundly before noon; these shall Grow old within your Mannor house, and die There too, and be buried in your own Chappel; And have their sinfull Seacole dust, mingled With th'ashes of your Warlike Ancestors. Topsaile. 'Tis true, to these unpleasant hazards Riot and Youth must bring us to: The gallant humour of the Age, no remedy. Whilst yet the Mothers blessing quarrels and chimes Ith' pocket thus: the thrift of Thirty years Sav'd out of Mince Pies, Butter, and dry'd Hopps. It must away; but where? In the Metropolis, London, the Spheare of Light and harmony? Where still your Taverne Bush is green, and flourishing; Your Punke dancing in Purple, With Musick that would make a Hermit frisk Like a young Dancer on a Rope. But alass! There's no such pure materials for delight In this dull Harbor, I will sooner draw My Sword, then my purse here, 'Tis a place fit Only for midnight Battels with the watch. Cable. And vildly destitute of Women, here Are none but a few Matrons of Biscay, That the Spaniards left here In Eighty Eight. Seawit. Cable, Your Hostesses Daughter at the Hoop, Desir'd me last night I would speak to you, For an old Sprit-sail to make her a Smock. Cable. You have Mony, Sir, you may be merry. Seawit. In sober truth, thou art. Cable. Why what am I? Seawit. As great a Sinner, As ere eate Bisket and Salt Beef. But Gentlemen, it lies much now within My power, although here windebound and distrest, To make your sad hearts light. Cable. Proceed any news of a late Shipwrack, Of two strangers seen floating on a plank, Each with a bag of Porteguez under His left arme. Seawit. No Sir, but since our Navy anchor'd in This Port, Our fame hath prosper'd so, That to behold our pride, and strength, there is This day arriv'd a Lady. Totsaile. How, a Lady? Seawit. The very flower and pleasure of the Spring, And hath a Wit so prosperous, one houre Of her converse would make a Courtier of A Carman: so rich, that the Turks vast Army Cannot starve upon her Land: Are prime Gamesters the very housewives of Her Dayrie play at sent: and her Ploughboys Double their wages at Cribidy and Picket. Cable. Well, I'm the Luckiliest Rogue that ever seckt. By this hand, Gentlemen, I think if my braines were knockt out o'renight, I should find them in my skull agen next morning. O my good Starrs, I do thank your bright Worships! Send such a purchase hither just in the nick And period of distress. Topsaile. Seawit, a little more intelligence! VVhere doth this Lady lie? Seawit. At widow Carracks house. VVhere there are wells new digg'd to lay her botled wine; Grotto's to keep her Person coole, and Kitchins That would serve Marck Anthony. Cable. But will she eate and drink? Seawit. How! Doe you think I bring you tidings of The Maid of Brabant, that liv'd by her smell, That din'd on a Rose, and supt on a Tulip. Cable. I meane will she feed high, and drink deep, like A Saxon-Bride, untill her Lover sleep Upon her lapp. Seawit. She entertaines, What will You more gentlemen? I heare not of her Vices. Cable. Oh were she but a Whore now, I were made. For if she be honest, she is not worth A hollow Tooth. Seawit. VVhy Cable? VVhy? Cable. Your honest VVomen are still unfortunate To me, they talke of Marriage, which I am prone too, Come, call in quickly her dull Deacon! or small Tyth takerâin his dimmityâCassack; And let him squeeze, and joyne our hands, untill They ake; then there's a pawse; whilst her Parent VVith a soure brow, and Trencher Beard, strait blasts My Eare, with an odd heathen word, call'd Joynture: Well Sir, I as in duty bound towards. My self promise largely: then Spys are sent T'inquire for one Captaine Cable of the South, What Lands, what Farmes he hath; and word is brought, That all the Purchase he 'ere made, was but A Noble, for a Mapp, which hangs in his Great Cabbin. Topsaile. Seawit, Your self and I must move alone. In visitation to this Lady. Seawit. Your must excuse me, Sir, he shall along, The interview will be too calme else. Come, lets prepare, Guard well your eyes, I'le bring you to a Beauty Shall put you both unto the wink. Cable. Thou art my Admiral, I will fight under Thy Lee, and celebrate thy mornings draught VVith a broad-Side. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Carack, Porter, Smoothall. Carrack. Be careful Porter, Let not a piece of Canvas, or course Kersey That smells of Pitch or Tarr, pass o're the Threshold. Their gross feedings On fulsome Butter, Essex Cheese, dry'd Stockfish, And scarce sweet Beef on Festivalls, makes 'em favour Like the Pumpe of a Ship, and to a tender Nostrill Is very dangerous. Porter. Is't your VVorships pleasure? Carrack. VVell answer'd, I am VVorshipful indeed, For I am rich, and a VVise VVoman told me, My Gold in time, may make Clowns say mine Honour; There are examples extant, but proceed VVith your question to my VVorship. Porter. May I suffer no man of VVar to enter? Carrack. Yes, your Captaines. Of the last Edition, and their Officers too; Nay, I allow young Volunteers, provided They show rich Lace, and Purle, and without Magick, Have shut a Mannour in a Trunck of Clothes, In hope to prove Commanders. Porter. VVith your pardon. VVhat think you of a Buffe Jerkin? Carrack. It may pass, And Shamois too, so it be well embroider'd, And have a touch of Amber. Porter. I am glad oft. 'Tis Captain Cables weare, and I should be sorry To thrust my self into a certain beating, By shutting him out. Carrack. True, 'tis a boyst'rous Sir, And should be wellcome in his shirt; but that His Captainship hates a Priest, and laughs at VVedlock, But ravins up his flie-blowne Lamb, or Mutton, Though he meet it in the City, or the Suburbs, But do your duties, I'le think of him alone. Porter. I shall be careful. [Exit Porter. Carrack. Now to you Smoothall, if that you be vigilant And marke, and learn the fashions of the time, 'Twill help you sooner to a Husband, then Your Father Farmers Cropp, or Wooll. Consider What noble Guests are now under my roof. The Lady Loveright, not an Heir, and Rich In expectation only, but possest Of a huge Estate, four Thousand a year, which came From her dead Grandmother. The Earl her Father Hath left it at her dispose, without a Guardian. Then Mistriss Joynture, one of a good Estate too, My Ladies Gentlewoman, Mistriss Nightingale, I may make thee a Gentlewoman, though thy Mother VVas Goody Smoothall, and do it by my Lords Pattent, VVhen I am a Baroness, 'tis now in fashion To metamorphise Chambermaids. The King Dubs Knights, and new-stampt Honour creates Gentry. Smoothall. And' please you the meer hope of this will prompt me To waite with diligence. Carracks. And I'le reward it. Smooth. VVhat may the grave Knight be that is so busie About the Lady of Honour? Carrack. Her honours Uncle, Sir Solemne Trifle. He's a Justice of Peace. And, in his Countrey, Custos Rotulorum, He can give a charge to the Fury at Quarter-Sessions And tell aforehand what will be their answer; To all his fellow-Justices he speaks gravely, And will hear none but himself. Have a care of him, You may have good of his Clark, a handsome strippling, He hath serv'd already three years of his Prentiship, And if he thrive out of his Quarter-fees, He may in time set up for himself. Fall off My Noble Guests appeare. Now to my posture. Enter Sir Solemne Trifle, Loveright, Jointure, Nightingale. Trifle. See honour'd Neece our carefull Land-Lady, She bowes most neatly, you would say, and Court-like, Pray you give me leave. Carrack. Madam. Trifle. You would excuse agen, (I know your thoughts) the want Of apt accommodations to receive Such noble Guests. Loveright. Sir, in my judgement all things. Trifle. Are, under pardon, you would say beyond All expectation of entertainment. In a Port-Town. Loveright. The Gentlewoman, Sir, Hath ample meanes. Trifle. To make this good. I know it, And that you would adde, she is a rich VViddow, VVell monyed, and well landed. Nightingale. Sir, her husband. Trifle. You will be chattering too pert Mrs. Magpie, Ye shall be no more a Nightingale; her husband, This you would say; and make a tedious tale of't, VVith, I forsooth, and no forsooth, but I can Relate it more concisely (for I hate Impertinence, and babling) was a Captain, A stout, and fortunate Captain, and could carry His ship to any Coast under the Moon, VVithout the help of his Master; and could use His Ropes-end on the Ship-boyes, and the Saylers, As well as his Boatswaine, which did well demonstrate His skill and valour. Thenâ Loveright. Now give me leave, You reprehend in others, that which you. Convince your self of, this is from the purpose. Trifle. I come to it now, pray you give me leave. Carrack. Excuse me. Her honour shall have leave, Sir, with your pardon, Fine VVomen stand by, and one old man talk all, 'Tis monstrous, nay abominable: Ile not suffer Such discipline in my House, I have a Tongue too, And therefore pray you be silent. I am bold To interrupt your Honour. But a word And I have done. 'Tis true I am a VViddow, And rich too as Sir Solemne sayes. My house, The best in Portsmouth, and hath entertain'd An Admirall, and his Mistress too, but they Have laine in several Chambers on mine Honour, I should have said my credit, I cry you Mercy, Heartily Mercy. Loveright. There is no offence. Carrack. My Husband (rest his Soule in Neptune's bosome) For his Body hath fed Haddocks) took a prize From the Hamburghers, and Brasile men, furnisht me VVith plenty of provision, but grown old He went to Sea again and died, but left me A Lusty young Widdow. I must weep to think How timely he went from me. Trifle. Mourne in Silence. I will discourse the rest. Pray you give me leave. Carrack. I cannot, nor I will not give you leave. Till I have told my story, and how farr I am her Honours Servant, would I had meanes to express it, as it is Pray you accept of't. There is nothing Court-like Your honour can expect, or I dare promise, My House is but a simple pile. Trifle. I will have leave now, She should have said, a stately Edifice. For Orchards, curious Gardens, private walks, Like an Italian Pallace. Carrack. Good Sir Solemne. Trifle. Withdrawing Roomes, in every one a Couch, For all occasions, and uses ready. Carrack. That's common, but my Hangingsâ Trifle. Silk and Gold, I know not whence you had 'em, but I finde The Rose and Crown and E. R. wrought upon 'em. I'le save your modesty, you shall not boast of Your other Furniture. Carrack, You will o'recome, And having read the Inventory. Trifle. I can say, that For the coursest use You shall have Silver. Carrack. A Bed with Utensils Perchance, or so; but for my Linnenâ Trifle. That Exceeds the rest; pure Damask, and perfum'd too, Her Cambrick Sheets, Downe BedsâNay, give me leave, I think I have done you right. Carrack. There's something else You might remember. Loveright. Nay, no more, I pray you. Was there ever such a Medley? Joynture. On this Theame I think she would ever hear him. Carrack. Good Sir Trifle. Trifle. You would say I thank youâ Joynture. A new storme. Loveright. We are rescu'd? Joynture. What are these? Loveright. Captains of the Fleet; and sent for By my direction. You have both spoke well, Take breath a while. Enter Loverights Woman. Woman. The Captain that sent hither to entreate Admittance, for himself, and's Friends, attends Your Ladiships Command. Loveright. Entreat him enter. [Exit Woman. Joynture. Shall we be charg'd with Men o'Warr too Madam, What Captain's this? Loveright. Seawit, a fellow that preserves his soule. So full of mirth, as if he never knew Calamity, nor sin; why he will make A Pris'ner laugh upon the Rack: his reason too Transcends his witt, and's courage equalls both; The very Darling of the Court and Town. Enter Seawit, Cable, Topsaile. Seawit. If there be trouble in this visit (Madam) You are to chide your virtues, and your fame, That doth oblige strangers to love, and serve you. Loveright. It is your kindness, Sir, to trust such fond reports; But I have cause to wish your knowledge of me May not instruct you to repent your faithâ Seawit. Your courtesie equalls your beauty, Lady, Let me press these Gentlemen unto Your knowledge and respect, they will both strive, How to deserve it better then my self. Loveright. They are your choice, Sir, and that commends 'em. [Topsaile and Cable salutes her. Trifle. All these are mighty men, and have no Money. Cable. Topsaile! I pray Heaven she be not honest! I feare her shrewdly, and the pure griefe of it Wounds my very heart: Ah, what pity 'tis, So excellent a Creature should be honest. Topsaile. Cable, if she but vouchsafe to love me, That shall appeare no great impediment; Nor shall you dare to think her honesty A vice: You mark my words, you shall not dare. Cable. If she be honest, in sad homely truth You must not presume to love her; because Time, occasion, and the Devil, may make Her blood turne, and then Sir she's for my purpose. Doe not look scurvily, 'tis dangerous. Seawit. Are you both mad? or do you take this Mansion For Pick'd hatch. You would be Suitors, yes to a She-deare, and keep your Marriages in Paris-Garden. Topsaile. No more! we are govern'd! Enter Woman. Woman. Your dinner doth attend your Ladiship. Loveright. Gentlemen, you'l give me leave t'invite you to a Faste. Seawit. We are your troubles, but ready to obey. Jointure. Sir Solemne, What's th'occasion of your thoughts? Trifle. I am thinking that my Scrivener will hardly Take that Fatt Captaines Bond. Joynture. You have reason, Sir. Nine of 'em in a Teeme, have scarce the strength To draw a Hundred pounds out of Cheapside. Trifle. Heaven help 'em, do they e're think to be sav'd then. Loveright. Come Uncle, lead the way. Topsaile. Small hands, full breasts, soft lips, and sparkling Eyes, If I can board her, she'le prove lawful prize. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Trifle, Seawit, Loveright, Topsaile, Jointure, Cable, Carracke, Nightingale. Seawit. Madam, your Entertainment hath been such, So free and full of bounty, that it leaves us No words t'express our thankfulness. Trifle. Give me leave, I know what you would say, but with your favour I'le do't, and spare your blushes: for she is Extreamely modest you would say, and noble. You would answer (For here I know your thoughts) were plain and cheap, And answer'd in no part my full desires With cost, and curiosity, to feast Such brave Commanders. Lady, I hope I have nick'd it, But pray you forbear your thanks for't, 'tis suppos'd Nay, Gallants, give me leave, you would reply, Her bounty did transcend, and perhaps add, That though the name of hospitality Is lost, nay dead, in her it is reviv'd. If any can say more, let me be put Out of commission for't, or what is worse, speak what concernes me only. Loveright. The perpetual motion Is in his Tongue I think. Seawit. I never read of Such a long-winded Monster. Trifle. You consent. (For so your silence warrants) all is spoken And aptly too on both parts, that could be Imagin'd, or expected, if there be A doubt remaining I'le dilate it further. Carrack. Indeed Sir Solemne we are satisfi'd; This only if you please. Trifle. What shall not now be heard, her squeaking Treble Will drown my Tenor. Loveright. No meanes left to free us From this confusion? Seawit. Trust it to me, Madam, I'le not dwell long on't, Sir Solemne. Trifle. You would say This Widdow does me wrong. Seawit. True, and that I Will do you right, there is a wager laid Among us after Supper, of which you are Elected Judge. Trifle. And pleader too if you please. I have wit, and tongue enough for both. Seawit. I know it. But hear the wager, I'le be short and pithee. There grew an argument, among which, Of the Nine Worthies, Christian, Heathen, Jew, Deserv'd privity. Trifle. A maine State-point. Seawit. 'Tis so. And to that man who best maintains this choice; The rest in sign of Victory, are to pay A hundred Crownes. Now if you please to walke Into the Gallery, you shall find these Worthies Drawn to the life there, without interruption Of this chattering Widow, or these other tatlers, (For they have Tongues too) you may sit in state, And examining the dead worthies pro &amp; contra, Defend, accuse, object, and answer for'em. You may spare your give me leave, or this you would say, They will obey with silence, you may be too As loud as you list, and make use of what action Or gesture you shall think fit, you will find it Such a feast of Soliloquy, and without disturbance, As yet you never tasted. Trifle. The design, Captain commands my thanks. Seawit. Then having practis'd, And argu'd with your self, the several titles These Worthies can pretend to, when we come To disputation, being thus prepar'd, You shall speak all your self, and we will hear you As you were the great Turk of Eloquence, And we your Mutes, or Statues. Trifle. A rare project, I'll instantly about it. [Exit Trifle. Loveright. You have bound us Your debters Captain, in removing this Unnecessary noise, 'tis a fit Province you have set him to govern. Joynture. Now we may talk And chuse the Theam our selves. Carrack. I know with whom I would discourse, but that my Cables frowns Advise me to stand off. Topsail. To yield to me Is no disparagement Cable when you have Sate down, and rendred up all interest, You do or can pretend unto this Lady; It will be honor enough to have it reported You once contended with me. Cable. Why good Ajax? You would betray your reading. I have read too, And know from whence this State-conceit was borrow'd, Since Ovid spake English, I ne'er yet found Latin In a Captains Commission, but one reason, why You claim precedence of me? Topsail. Thou must grant I am better parted, more polite and vers'd in The Rules of Courtship. Cable. Better parted, why Sir? Cause you have richer suits? My observation Hath told me hitherto, that your best parts, are A little singing out of tune, and that With a scurvy hoarse voice, to a Fidlers Boy, That never was admitted to a Tavern, Shall out-do you in a Tap-house for a Test, When your Throat is clearest. 'Tis said you can dance too, Caper, and do tricks like a Jack-a-napes, A prime and courtlike Vertue, which you learn'd from The Dancing-Schools Usher, or his Underling. Topsail. I shall be angry. Cable. Fie no, you are dangerous, I'll rather come To composition with you. Topsail. If it be fair, I shall give ear to't, I am of a good nature: Propound it. Cable. This way the Indenture runs then, If you can sing, or frisk your self into This Ladies Bed, when the Priest hath done his Office, You shall put in security after a Moneth, (For you are not built up, Sir, to hold out longer) When you are forc'd to ride and visit your Uncle, I shall have free access, and liberty With your consent, under your hand, and seal too, To court her, and enjoy her as a Mistress. Topsail. And I to be your Cuckold? Cable. And good reason, Canst thou be so unconscionable as to ingross A whole Wife to thy self, or deny me, When thou art gorg'd up to the Throat, to feed On thy reversions? hast thou no Charity in thee? No feeling of thy Neighbors wants? or shall not This young and gamesome Lady be allow'd When 'tis in fashion, and by most subscrib'd too, A Servant with a Husband? no compassion On Batchelors of Fifty and odd? Topsal. No more. Did not the priviledge of the place protect you I wouldâ Cable. What would you do? Topsail. You shall hear further, Believ't you shall. Loveright. They grow loud. Seawit. Are you mad? Or drunk, or both? Topsail. Such you may hear, When you use better manners. Cable. If the Ass Be gall'd, let him winch. Seawit. Do you make this Ladies house A Sutlers Booth to braul in? Cable. Be not so hot, Sir, I'll do as I think fit. Topsal. Preserve your Lectures To read to your charge, Sir Furious Inland, he may hear you, and applaud it. Cable. I am past Your Tutorship. Topsail. I'll follow mine own designs. [Exeunt Cable, Topsail. Carrack. O my brave Cable, if thou wouldst but hold Thy Carrack to an Anchor, she would seek No other Port, this quarrel must be tane up, Or I am shipwrack'd. [Exit Carrack. Seawit. Which way to excuse Their incivility, or my want of judgment, For bringing such rudeness to your presence, falls not In my dull apprehension, it throws A taint on our profession. Loveright. Not at all; Their Leprosie cleaves to themselves, and cannot Infect your better temper. Seawit. 'Tis your Charity To say so Madam. Loveright. Without flattery Captain, So well I like your conversation, mirth, and freedom, That I much wish, while the winds stay you here, You would know no other Table, what was wanting To day, shall be supply'd: But pray you tell me, What kind of Man is that Sir Furious Inland, Your charge I think they call'd him? Seawit. He's a Gentleman Of fair descent, and ample means, but subject To their disease of quarrelling; his Sword Hangs still too near his right hand, he loves fighting Above all pleasures, and is more delighted With the dangers of a Duel, then the honor Of having had the better; he was trusted By some of his noble Kinsmen to my care, In hope the Discipline of the War might tame him: I have done little good upon him yet, His mettal will not bowe. But surely, Madam, Had he been present, he had paid these Rorers In their own coyn, yet thus much I can say in his deferce, In the height of all his wildness He loves and honors Ladies; for whose service He's still a ready Champion. Loveright. A strange Character; I shall receive it as a favor, if You grant me means to see him. Seawit. He's aboard, But I'll send for him presently. He may yield Occasion of mirth, and without hazard Of life or limb, I will present him to you, And till then kiss your hands. [Exit Seawit. Loveright. I shall expect you. Now Cosin, your opinion of this Captain? The general voice (and I believe it) speaks him A compleat Man. Joynture. It may be so, in his Profession, but with your pardon Lady Neither the place you live in, nor the company That do frequent your house, can free you from Severer censures. Loveright. Free me Cosin? I am Careless as they are curious, to inquire into My actions, but from you I will hear What I am tax'd for; but I pray you speak it In a merry tone, none by to over-hear, Freedom and mirth becomes us. Joynture. I approve it. 'Tis wonder'd why (if vertuous, for your fame Is call'd in question) having of your own Mannors, and goodly houses in the Countrey, And one for Winter pleasures in the City (And that of large receipt for entertainments) You rather chuse to live an inmate, under Anothers Roof in a Port Town, then where Your pow'r is absolute. Loveright. They come up roundly to me. But what in their grave wisdoms do they judge The principal motive? Joynture. Love of noise, and rudeness, To see the Drums and Trumpets in the morning To rouze you up, your own Musicians sleeping; To see the Sailors dance, to give you colours To every Officer, to feast the Captains, That when they are aboard they may carouse In Wine, while it lasts, or (that spent) Quarter-Cans To the brave Viragos health. Loveright. Is this the worst They charge me with? Joynture. The best construction rather Of your coming hither, others whisper (such Is my intelligence) that you hold a Courtier Too soft, a Countrey Gentleman too dull, To make a Husband, and that your main end is, To be kiss'd to the purpose in the Gun-room, Upon a Cannon by a rough Commander, Then brought to Bed in his Cabbin of two Boys; And when they are Christen'd, in the place of Bells, To hear the Ordnance roar a lullaby to your Seaborn issue. Loveright. This may be, but wherefore are they thus suspicious? Joynture. On good grounds, and sure ones: No Man that looks on you, will believe your purpose To live and die a Maid, I can read Mother Upon your Forehead, then having had such choice Of rich, and noble Suiters; well shap'd Men too For a Ladies service, and among the rest, Sir Studious Warwel your Idolater; he's learn'd, active, of an antient house too, A Gentleman whose fortune equals yours, And he to be refus'd, and by your scorn Imploy'd, but none know whether. Loveright. Thou hast said Wench. Hear me reply, the great estate commended In this Sir Studious Warwel was a hinderance, And no way did advance my favors to him. I have enough, and my ambition is To make a Man, not take addition from him. I would have him poor, and if unlearn'd the better; I cannot feed on the Philosophers Banquet, Nor would I have my Bed-fellow a cold Cynik. I will be plain too. If he have no Coat I'th' Heralds Books, I say agen the better; His Kinred shall not aw me with a Statue Wanting a Nose or Ear of his great family, Though they swear 'twas John a Gaunts. My Father was A Soldier, and for that my Mother lov'd him. His title of an Earl was no charm to her, And when I find a perfect, and a poor one, still take me with you Cosin; if a Soldierâ Joynture. There are few of 'em rich. Loveright. I have the better choice then. That perfect poor one I will make my Husband, It is resolv'd, I'll tell thee more ere long Wench. [Exeunt. Scena Secunda, Topsail. Topsail. Let the quarrel sleep a while; to win this Lady Concerns me nearer. If I get her, I have honor, And never fight for't, policy must take placeâ In this of valour, and I will omit No helps that may make for me. Let me consider, Her Uncle's powerful with her, if I can But make him mine, with the aids of those rich Ornaments, Cable admires, (Though he seem'd to contemn in his choller) all's Cock sure. He comes most timely, I will upon him. Enter Trifle with a Table Book. Trifle. Here are all the Points I am to treat of. This for Alexander, For Godfrey of Bullogne this, and good King David I have for thee too. If I wrong the least Of the Nine Worthies (yet I'll firk 'em home too) May I never prove the Tenth. Topsail. Sir, one word with you. Trifle. I am to speak not hear, you trouble me. But that I am a Christian my self, I should incline to Hector; Julius Cesar Did very well too, and the rest brave Men all. As I am their Advocate their Fees alike too, It were injustice if I should be partial, Good Sir forbear, I have many strings to play on. Topsail. I, but one Suit. Trifle. Pray you give me leave. I know it, In your particular fancy, you affect Above the rest, one Worthy. Tell me his name. I'll not be dumb in his praise. Topsail. Worthy? what Worthies? Trifle. Make it not strange. Are you not one of those That are to night to hear the Worthies Causes First pleaded, then decided? Topsail. You are jeer'd, Sir. Trifle. A hundred Crowns adjudg'd to him whose Worthy Should have precedency? Topsail. There's no such matter, Seawits device to send you off, while he Courted your Neece in your absence, on my life There was no such thing intended, or e'er dream'd on. The company is dispers'd. Trifle. Have I then lost my hopeful preparations? Topsail. You are wrong'd. Trifle. Not I, posterity suffers for the loss Of what I had deliver'd, which recited, I had a Stationer of mine own to Print it: I am exceeding melancholly. Topsail. Go aboard With me, and purge it. Do me a favor in Another kind, you shall not lose your labor, I'll help you to an Auditory, that can judge too Of your Tropes and Figures. Trifle. Who are they? Topsail. My Sailors. I have taught 'em not to cavil at the things They understand not, I'll be silent too, You shall speak all your self. Trifle. How you engage me! I'll take the Pictures along to make distinction For whom I plead. Topsail. It will do well. Trifle. Your suit now, What e'er it be 'tis granted, for this curtesie. Out with't I pray you. Topsail. I'll tell you in the Cock-Boat. [Exeunt. Enter Cable. Cable. Sure this Lady's honest! Or if she be not There's but small advantage to my hopes, whilst that Tempter (young Topsail) hovers near her eye. The Rogue has qualities for love, which I want. Why he will sing you like any Widows daughter That's working of Bone-Lace, no Weaver at His Loom comes near him; and dance till he tire All the Tabers in a Wake. Now the truth is I cannot sing; for with eating Butter, when I lay amongst The Dutch Ships at Delph, my voice is quite gone; And for matter of dancing, you may expect as much From a Lobster on a Fishmongers stall. I would the Wind would turn. No Money! and in A Harbor too! Truth, 'tis a pretty calamity For a Gentleman of my inclination! Enter a Porter, Carrack. Porter. I left him walking from the Key, towards The back-door of your worships Garden. Look, There he stands, and very sad; sure he had But a light dinner at your Worships House, For he's eating's Nails already. Carrack. Get you home! And sirrah see you pile those Billets up I'th'yard; and do you hear, make haste, and fetch The Glasier strait to mend the Casement in The Darnex Chamber. Porter. Yes forsooth. Carrack. And let me see; be sure you bid the Baker Send in more Bread to night, and let the Kid Be made into a Pasty! Porter. I shall forsooth. [Exit. Carrack. What melancholly Captain! Cable. Widow, introth my thoughts were somewhat busie, About division of a prize. Carrack. Why have you taken one? Cable. No Widow, no! But when it shall please Heaven T'allow us the good fortune; I was thinking With how much Conscience, and Discretion too, I might Dispose it into shares. I am Very just in my Nature. Carrack. Well Captain, I observe of late, (and truly With some compassion too) that you are full Of troubled thoughts, and much opprest in heart. Heaven keep you from lying in a Chamber Where there is a Cross beam. Cable. Why do you think I love activity, and will swing at Midnight in my shirt? Carrack. Nay, they above Know all, but certainly y'are very sad. Cable. As other Mortals use to be, that want Money, Wine, or a Wench. Carrack. Lo you there now! Just such another Man was my Husband, And would talk so too. Well, Peace rest his Soul, I'm sure his Body had but little rest On Earth; for he was a Womans Man, Captain, A good one too; he lay not idle he, I speak it in my tears. Cable. Now can I hardly forbear to cry too, But that I left my Handkerchief in my Cabin, and want somewhat to dry my Eyes When they are wet. Widow thou do'st Not know, how much thy kindness hath prevail'd Carrack. I Sir, if you but guess the cause. Cable. Nay, I find no cause, but Your good parts. Carrack. Good parts indeed! you are so like my Husband. And just (as they say) such a rough hewn Man Was he: So troublesome to Maids and Women, Of meek behaviour, that they would all cry Out on him, yet they lov'd him too: Truly he was Scarce to be trusted in the dark. Cable. A modest Gentleman belike, for he Would do no leudness before the Suns face. Carrack. No truly; and when the happy knot Was ty'd, good heart, he was reclaim'd; we lov'd Like any House-Doves, ever more billing To the comfort indeed of all young people. Cable. What knot do you mean Widow? Carrack. Why of Matrimony. Cable. O is the Wind fix'd there still! If you, or Your Vicar, get me into your Fools noose, I'll give you leave to pull Hairs out of my Beard, And bridle Fleas with 'em. Draw in a Yoke! Carrack. In sadness Captain, I could chide you now; What is the reason you renounce Marriage? Is it because you do not love to come In a Church, the Priest can do't in a Chamber. Cable. No, no, I love Churches, I mean to turn Pirate, rob my Countrey-men, and build one. Carrack. Why well said, there is some hope in that. Cable. But for Marriage, do not think on't. It is A most excellent Receipt to make Cuckolds. The short truth is, if you will ply your Malmsey, Rejoyce o'er your spic'd Bowl, and learn to drink Your self into a comely trance, I shall Love you, but then sometimes you must consent too, I mean in the dark, Widow. Carrack. Fie upon him! He is so like my Husband. Cable. Farewel! Get thee to thy Closet, and drink To thy Husbands ghost a whole Pint of Mum. Remember Matrimony makes Cuckolds: 'Tis to be us'd after Fourscore, when thy days Of Temptation are so long past, thou canst Not indanger a smooth Brow. Carrack. Well Sir, I'll make you tamer, or else lose My Womans wit with watching. [Exeunt several ways. Enter Boatswain, Seawit. Seawit. Boatswain well met, thou must instantly aboard, And fetch the Knight that is my Charge ashore. Boats. You mean Sir Furious Inland, surely one Of the Winds got him, his Cradle was a Drum, And he was nurs'd upon a Belfry. He hath more rage and noise then a Winter storm: Onely his Vertue is, he will out last it. You that are his Captain Sir, may rule him: But in your absence he hath got the trick To rule your Officers. Seawit. Does he make mutiny? Boats. Your Master, Purser, Gunner, and his Mate, And I my self feel him about the Shoulders: Had he but my office two days, he would Wear out a Cable With Castigation, as he calls it, look! He's come ashore already. Enter Inland. Seawit. Away, leave me. [Exit Boatswain. My fiery Charge! Why hast thou left thy Wooden walks In my good Ship, to tread on slippery Pebles here? Where Men of Waves meet, and conspire To couzen Men of War. Inland. What should we do at Sea without a Wind. Seawit. These Winds are mad blades, they'll do what they list. Inland. Would they had Bodies that we might fight with 'em. Seawit. I rather wish th'hadst an old Aunt in Norway, That would command them with a charm: But who Hath chas'd my little Libian Lion thus Into a Foam? Methinks thou look'st, as thou Didst come from slaughter, and from prey? Inland. A Rogue vex'd me as I pass'd through the high Street. Seawit. How my dear Charge. Inland. He askt me what a clock it was. Seawit. Was that offence? Inland. Death! Do I look like a Watchmaker, am I bound to take charge of the hours, and give Every Rogue intelligence how they pass. Seawit. Well, and how did you proceed. Inland. I beat him. Seawit. A little calmer my brave charge. In sooth Thou hast choller enough t'enflame nine fat Dutch Burghers, and make 'em all turne Fencers. I've heard of your fierce discipline aboard. Inland. What would you have me do? Shall I rust Like a Sword in a Scabbard for want of exercise? Shew me the Kings Enemies and I'm satisfied! If not, let's Subjects look to't, for I must fight. Seawit. Thou shalt see the Kings Enemies. Inland. But, Where are they? Seawit. Why gone aside to make their Wills, and pray, They know they are but dead when they appear. Inland. Captain, I love the King, and am bound In conscience, and good nature to kill his Enemies. Seawit. Why right! th'art my Disciple now, just to My will, and wish. But prethee tell me Charge! Besides Divine, and Morall reasons, I Would know what secret int'rest thou hast in The King, that makes thee leave thy Hawks, And Hounds, to hunt his Enemies. Inland. Why I love him. Seawit. I but some cause for it That is particular, and personal. Inland. I have a good one, but I'le conceale it. Seawit. How Charge from me? your Friend that must direct You in the day of Fight! come', What is it? Inland. Why he cur'd me of the Evil. Seawit. Charge I thank thee. This day, I will both reward thy good nature, And imploy thy courage; there is now lodg'd I'th' Town, a Lady of excellent wit and beauty. Inland. Does she love Fighting Seawit. Nay, do but hear me. Topsaile, and Cable, Both Captains in our Fleet, are now in controversie For her Love, and do advance their hopes With so much fury, and ill-manner'd rage, That they are both become her trouble. Inland. I'le fight with 'em. Seawit. A little patience, and observe, you shall Fight with 'em, and subdue 'em too, till they Have temper, and civility; but know She hath an Uncle, call'd Sir Solemne Trifle. Inland. I'le fight with him too. Seawit. Nay marke me you must court him I have design'd it so, follow and I'le instruct you. Tis fit, whilst VVindbound thus in a dull Port, VVe ease our want of business, with our sport. Exeunt.]</field>

These Carrot-eating Dutch have filch'd already Most of the Bulloigne out of the Land; they exhause our Gold, And send us Pickled Herrings. Down with it Mungrel. Seawit. VVhat vers'd in State-points too? I honour thee. But on my love forbear now. Let not zeale Too farr transport thee. Clear thy stormy looks, Thou art to visit Ladies. Furious. And fight for 'em. Seawit. Thou shalt, and do it bravely. [Exeunt Seawit and Furious. Warwel. Farewell Captain. I am sorry for this disaster. [Exit Warwell. Bumble. Adieu mine Here. Ick sall meet him at Sea, and den he ducks for't. [Exeunt. Enter Carrack, Porter. Carrack. I like thy disguise. Porter. I wonder at your Worships, Heav'n bless the mark, you look in this light habit Like one of the Suburb-Sinners, I may pass too For your officious Squire. Carrack. Sirrrah, leave prating, And doe what I command. I would appeare The very thing thou speak'st of. Thou art acquainted With those common creatures, and canst teach me how To imitate their behaviour, How do I walk? Porter. You have their pace already, but you must carry Your Gown a little higher, your Silk Stocking, Your dainty Leg, and foot, will not be seen else. You must sometimes take occasion to command me To tie or untie your Shoe, or blow your Roses, And as I kneel to do my office, strike me, And cry, you dog you hurt me. This I assure you. Your Sattin Gamesters practice. Carrack. Easily learn'd, Am I not an apt Scholler. [Gives him a Box of the Eare. Porter. I'm sure your Tutor smarts for't. Carrack. I lose time. This is your house? Porter. A simple one. But 'twill serve the turn: my Wife has trickt it up, And waites for your Worship. Carrack. 'Tis well, leave me here, And having found Cable, do as this directs you [Exeunt. Topsaile, Trifle (drunk) Musitians. Topsaile. Hoe let him downe, the noise of the great Ordinance At his coming on, and going off, sans doubt Hath turn'd his braines, the Wine too works, and that Which forces other men to talk, hath silenc'd His everlasting tongue. He held me three hours In his discourse of the Worthies, till the Saylors And Ship-boys fell asleep, and n'ere gave over Till he perceiv'd all Eyes were clos'd, then tir'd And angry too, he was no more observ'd; The Worthies suffer'd execution in Their pictures, for he took e'm one by one And flung 'em over board. Sir Solemne Trifle Not to be wak'd with Thunder! I must now Speak for my self, or rather Sing, begin. SONG. O thou that sleep'st like Pigg in Straw, Thou Lady dear, arise; Open (to keep the Sun in awe) Thy pretty pinking eyes: And, having stretcht each Leg and Arme, Put on your cleane white Smock, And then I pray, to keep you warme, A Petticote on Dock. Arise, arise! Why should you sleep, When you have slept enough? Long since, French Boyes cry'd Chimney-sweep, And Damsels Kitching-stuffe. The Shops were open'd long before, And youngest Prentice goes To lay at's Mrs. Chamber-doore His Master; shining Shooes. Arise, arise; your Breakfast stayes, Good Water-grewell warme, Or Sugar-sops, which Galen sayes With Mace, will doe no harme. Arise, Arise; when you are up, You'l find more to your cost, For Mornings-draught in Caudle-cup, Good Nutbrown-Ale, and Tost. Enter Loveright and Jointure. Loveright. I told you 'twas no common voice. Good morrow, You are an early Lark. Topsaile. I wish my voice Were worthy of your Ladiships Eares I should Have chosen some sad note to plead a pardon For my late breach of Manners in your presence, But studying your Mirth, I thought this apter To call you from your rest, The angry powers Are pleas'd with humane Sacrifice, but Ladies Of your soft temper will I hope accept Of my submission. Loveright. This acknowledgment VVould expiate a greater crime; who's this? Jointure. Your reverend Uncle! Topsaile. Hurt a little Madam, In a Sea-Entertainment. Jointure. He begins [Trifle stretching himself. To wake already. Loveright. Too soone, I feare, and with The danger of our Eares. Trifle. Heigh, ho, Where am I? Cable me up, the shot plaies thick upon us; I have fought enough for a Justice of peace and quorum. Jointure. How do you Sir? Trifle. As well as man can doe. After so hot a Sea-fight, give me leave. Loveright. He will not out of that tone, or drunk or sober. Trifle. VVhat make you abroad? you'le say to cure my wounds, I thank your care, for I am shot through, and through. Touch me not, if you do, you are blown up; I am all Gun-powder, and Bullet, Lady. VVe have done the King such service. Loveright. VVhat, deare Uncle? Trifle. VVe have pepper'd the Holland Hulkes, I saw three of 'em Through the smoke in the Gun-roome sink, while I bestride The Canon, and caper'd. Goe get me pen and paper. [Falls in his Chaire. I'le write the courant my self, &amp; have it Printed By a Stationer of mine own, one that shall do it In spight of the Statute, forâ (Nods &amp; sleeps. Loveright. He's fast again. Captain, you wounded him, &amp; 'twill shew nobly In you to cure him. Topsaile. Leave him to my care I'le see him safe, then waite you. [Exit Topsaile with Trifle. Loveright. At your pleasure. Enter Seawit, Inland. Jointure. Here are other visitants. Loveright. And those I look for. To them, Enter Seawit, Inland. Seawit. That you may see I'm loyall to your Ladiship, And fit to be believ'd, I here present The Gentleman, whom late my promise did Assure, a servant to your wit, and beauty. Loveright. Sir Furious Inland, or my aime deceives me. Seawit. You give him both his Name and Title Lady. He will deserve the honour to kiss your Ladiships hand. [He brings him to salute the Ladies. Why how now Charge? stark dumb, you have no more Compliment then a Fish. Goe speak to her. Inland. You'l give me leave to rubb my Elbow first, In signe that I am taken! All Staffordshire Cannot shew her fellow. Seawit. Come your address, an old Haberdasher Hath as much courtship! Doe but speak to her! Inland. Madam, Have you any quarrels? Loveright. Sir, I Deserve not any, for I doe no wrong. Inland. Right or wrong, that's not the business. If you Have none, dispatch and make some, as many As you please too: I'le fight 'em over and over. Loveright. I'm sorry Sir, my patience, and my quietness, Is such, I cannot furnish you; 'tis pitty You should want employment. Inland. Lady, Have you any quarrels? Jointure. None Sir, but with my glass, when it doth render My face less handsome then it is. Inland. Captain, VVould thou wouldst call for VVine, and get These Ladies to drink hard. Seawit. To what purpose? Inland. Perhaps they'r given to quarrel in their Wine, It matters not with whom; or why, so I May fight for'em. Seawit. 'Las, that affords small hope. Sure Charge thou dost not use to pray, for else Thou couldst not be thus destitute of place, And fit occasion for a quarrel. Loveright. Sir, I had thought, you kept your anger charg'd Against the Kings Enemies, not ours; and that You left your Land, your Bugle-horne, and Lute, In search of them. And though y'are windbound here, A faire gale may shortly come, and bring you where You may imploy your Sword, till your wrist ake; Preserve your self till then. Inland. That will be no thanks to your Ladiship. I'de faine see you in the meane time, so well Natur'd, to beget so much of a quarrell, As may but hinder me from being idle. And now I think on't: if you have a little Dogge That's quarrelsome, let him bite my Captain By the shinn, and I'le defend the manner And the cause. Loveright. This is such a Dagonet. As out-does your character! Captain, believ't, You did deliver him with a faint breath. Story and Travaile cannot find his Fellow Jointure. You should look to his diet, I'm afraid He feeds on Gunpowder. Seawit. My dear Lady! let me beseech you both To move a little distance by; and you Shall see sport enough to prove him a Miracle. Enter Cable, Topsaile: Cable. Hah! Topsaile here agen: he dances himself Into her Company; I would there were A good Chain'd-shot embracing your fine leggs; But yet if they were cut off, he would sing still: No way to spoile's voice, but to cut his throat. [He beckens Topsaile. Topsaile. You see I am obedient, Sir, heave but your Crooked finger thus, I'm at your beck. Cable. If thou beest an honest fellow, steale away, And hang thy self; I would fain have thee dead. But am loth to disturb the Company. Topsaile. 'Tis a faire motion, if you would begin, Considering too you can dispatch the business Sooner with your weight, I'le stay till you have done. Cable. Now the Pox take thee, for th'ast no more kindness Then a shav'd Serjeant has to a Templer. But we shall meet in a fit place, and then If your Sword can find the way to let a Soule out Sooner then mine, sing on, you have the fortune. Topsaile. It is a poor blind Weapon Sir, but I Shall make shift to lead it in a strait lineâ Seawit. Charge I foretell a storme! those Captaines there, Mark but their looks, they swell, and breath into Each others face, the fumes of direfull wrath. Is't fit? In such a gentle presence too? Inland. Captain Topsaile! one short word in your eare, And you may be thankfull 'tis not a blow. Topsaile: I am thankfull, Sir. This Monsieur will meet At last, with some body mad as himself, That knows not's humour, and then he is defunct. Cable. I hope a quarrel, 'tis a fiery Villager. Bring me a Flie in September, and I'le As soon take a Lease of his life as of That Dragons. Topsaile. I pray your business. Inland. How dare you Sir appeare before this Lady, That lately in her presence were so rude. Topsaile. Sir, I have ask't her pardon, and am reconcil'd. Inland. How! reconcil'd a quarrel without blood! Topsaile. You must consider, Sir, 'twas with a Lady. Inland. No reconcilement can be made with honour, Till one or both have bled for it: Be the Defendant Man, Woman or Child. Topsaile. These are new Sword-Cases, but I shall learne. Inland. If you will learne, you shall be taught; but I Have heard there is a mortall difference 'tween Cable and you! How chance y'are both alive? Topsaile. There's reason for it, Sir, W'have not fought yet. Inland. But Sir, How chance you have not fought? Topsaile. Why there you question me unto my wish: I've had th'ambition to expect so much Kind friendship from your self as may intreat You Sir, deliver him a challenge from me. Inland. Where is the Paper? give it me. I'le do't. Topsaile. Your Chartells out of fashion, Sir, here is My Glove, which if you'l but present him as My Gage, and bid him name the time, and place; You are my noble second, and my friend. Inland. Your Glove shall serve, he shall receive it though 'Twere Sheep-skin. Cable. Now for shelter! the storme draws near me too. [Takes Cable aside. Inland. Topsaile my Friend defies you, there's his gage. Cable. Troth I am sorry that his choice could find No other bearer then your self. Inland. You undervalue me, I'm fit to be A second to as good a Man, if you, Believe it not, put it to trial strait; I'le fight with you first. Cable. You mistake my grief, For you are he I had design'd my Second. And now I'm destitute of one to bear, My gage in Token I accept of his. Inland. Why Sir, I'le be your Second too, give me your Glove. Cable. Marry Sir, and shall! there, convey it to him. If this Zuitz had but a two handed Sword, He would depopulate the Island, leave none but His Huntsman alive, the rest should be minc'd For his Hounds. [Inland beckens Topsaile aside. Topsaile. I protest Sir Furious, this noble favour Hath ty'd me to you in everlasting bonds. And how dear Sir, What sayes he? Inland. He doth accept your gage, and has return'd You his by me, I am his Second. Topsaile. How Sir Furious: why! you are mine! Inland. Sir, I am any mans that will fight, and you Had best agree both upon a Meeting, And fall to't handsomely without satisfaction, I'le have no satisfaction, 'tis a base word, And fitter for the bottome of a Bond, Then for a Souldiers mouth. Topsaile. 'Fore me, a young Balthazar. Seawit. The very Ghost of Botevill Met in an English skin; How do you like him Madam? Loveright. I dare not but like him. And challenge me. Jointure. Beshrew me, the danger hath spoil'd the mirth: Will they proceed? Loveright. Seawit, We may depend I hope on your discretion, to preserve Things safe, and keep the matter qualify'd. Seawit. You may presume so, Madam, or I'm sure I shall deserve but little of your trust. [Takes Inland aside. Do'st thou hear Charge! if they should fight it out After the French way, where the Seconds must Encounter too; how will you find an opposite? Inland. I thank you for that question, Governor. But now I think on't, you may chuse which side You please, and we'll fight two to two! Seawit. I kiss your hand dear Charge, you do me honor! But I'm a dull manager of these affairs, You must give me a little time to consider! Enter Nightingale. Nightingale. I was desir'd with special hast to give Your Ladiship this Letter. Loveright. With so much hast! How is't subscrib'd within! [Opens it and starts. Inland. Is't a Challenge (Madam) I'll be your Second. Loveright. It shall not need Sir; the Contents will ask No answer that is hazardous. Inland. The Spirit's tame that sent it then; for Men Of Mettal, never write but challenges. Loveright. Captain, I must intreat some privacy, And truce among these Men of Wrath, and their Bold Second for an hour. You'll procure it? Seawit. Your own command is full authority To teach us how we shall obey! [Exeunt Loveright, Nightingale. Joynture. When these Sir are dismiss'd, let me desire (On some important cause) your company I'th'Orchard walk. Seawit. I shall attend you Lady. Lend me thine Ear ChargeâThou wilt do it; within One hasty hour, I'll come, e'er you can pledge Two Romekins of Wine! Farewel Charge. [Exeunt, Seawit, Joynture. Inland. Gentlemen no words here, besides, it is My Governors request I lead you both, Where we may drink together, and appear, Not like to things enrag'd with malice, but Provok'd to battle by our honor; those I take it were his words. He'll meet us strait. Topsail. Lead on the way; Sir, if our Legs hold out We'll have the Hearts to follow. Cable. Were this skirmish but painted, it would sell For that of the Centaures. [Exeunt omnes. Enter Loveright, Warwel, Nightingale. Loveright. Leave us to bid you welcome as a stranger. [Exit Nightingale. Custom commands. [They salute. Warwel. And that I hope will bind you To keep your promise Lady. Loveright. When I know How the conditions are perform'd on your part, You may hear further. Warwel. You enjoyn'd me, Madam, As I prefer'd th'enjoying you before My Lands, or dearer studies, to appear. A Man possest of nothing but my hopes, In being your Creature, to deserve your favor. Loveright. 'Tis true, I did, not will I have my Husband Borrow addition but from my self; Nay, he must part with what he call'd his own, If he would be the master of what's mine. Warwel. I have obey'd your will, and that you may Receive me as the subject of your pleasure. My Money's vanish'd; for, by your fair hand, I have not one small piece of the Kings Coyn, Nor care to get it. Now I shall not tempt you Like an Alderman-Widower, with shewing you The Thousand pound Bags in my Counter, Morgages, Or Statutes of Poor Debtors, I have freed all, And sold my Books too, to serve you, shall be My onely study. If you search my Pockets And find the Tale of Troy, or an Almanack there, Or William Wisdoms Meeters, yet renounce me. I have no Trunks of Cloaths, you see my Wardrobe. And if you do not now New Rig me, I have vow'd in this To be extreamly lowsie, rather then, I'll cross your humor. Loveright. This is a good Imprimis Of your Obedience; but you have Lands yet, And those may make you proud, and nourish hopes, You may command me. Warwel. They shall be all employ'd To pious uses, sell some part of them And build an Hospital, I'll assure the rest For the maintenance of Maim'd Soldiers, and that It may appear 'twas not vain glory, or Ambition in me, of an after name, You shall be writ the Foundress. What would you more? Loveright. I would have you a Perfect Soldier, without that The rest is nothing. Warwel. I come now from Sea, And I have serv'd at Land, for how many years; Would you have me Prentice to the Trade? Loveright. Till you turn a right and good one; 'tis not roaring. Or fighting for my Glove, can make you such. I would have you rise up to command an army, By brave desert, not favor: In my Cabinet I have the character of a true Soldier, Writ with my Fathers hand; when you are such As he describes him, I'll forbear to be A Mistress, and acknowledge you my Master. So once more welcome. Warwel. There is no resisting Such strong temptations and sweet pay, I'll put on What shape you please. Loveright. I'll chuse one shall not wrong you. [Exit. Enter Seawit, Joynture. Seawit. A little farther Lady, here's a shade Secret and cool, where you may breathe your thoughts With a safe voice, unless w'are Traytors to Our selves: And look where a sweet Primrose Bed Invites us (if you please) to lie down and talk. The Flowers are innocent, and surely mean No harm in the temptation. Joynture. I am not weary Sir, if you'll admit My business in this posture, I'll deliver it. Seawit. A little nearer Lady! You have shown (Believ't) an excellent courage already, T'adventure that alone with one of my Profession and desires. Joynture. Which I should hardly do, Had not my observation mark'd you out A man of fair demeanor, and civility. Seawit. Well, take your Sexes priviledge, your will, And to your business. Come! your business Lady! Joynture. I would induce it with a question if You'll give me leave. Seawit. My Ears are large, and open! Joynture. Sir, are you marry'd? Seawit. By this light she comes to jear me; Loveright And she have lay'd their little heads Together, and mean to make me their sport. Joynture. You promis'd a Reply! Are you marry'd? Seawit. No I'm a Maid. Joynture. I'm serious Sir, would you would be so too. Seawit. Well, I am not marry'd, on with your business. Joynture. My next demand will press (perhaps) nearer, And boldly on the Secrets of your Brest. Seawit. I shall confess all. Joynture. Pray tell me (and with words intentive as I purpose mine) how far the Lady Loveright, and Your self, have mutually consented either In hope, or promise: Part of this Secret Is mine already; for I know she loves you. Seawit. I am jeer'd! 'tis now as evident as day! I'll give her scope, and see what 'twill come to. Joynture. Will you not answer Sir? Seawit. I have promis'd her. Joynture. What Sir? Speak! Seawit. To come to Supper! In sooth, that's all th'engagement between us. Joynture. 'Tis very strange! One question more, And then, you have leave to censure my manners. Pray, what estate have you? Seawit. D'you take me for a Lawyer, or a Citizen. Joynture. For neither. Seawit. I know none in these times Have or can get estates, but they! We Soldiers, Accompt estates but transitory things And can shew you text for it? Joynture. Have you none Sir? Seawit. Yes: Now I think on't, After the death of an old Aunt, I have The Tole of a Wharff near Rothorith, will Yield me about Four Marks a year. Joynture. These are but narrow Blessings to Entail Upon your Heirs Male. But now Sir, I hope I shall a little comfort your long sufferings. How much would you esteem your self oblig'd Unto that Woman, should redeem you from These wants, and danger of the War, and take You to her lawful Bed, there furnish you With sleep, and peaceful thoughts; but when you wake, Shew you her Cabinets, and Chests, shining With Jewels, and with Gold; that may maintain These joys still fresh, and new? Seawit. Good, very good! I was never jeer'd by a Smock before. Joynture. Are you struck dumb? What fair appliances And love might such a Woman merit from Your Tongue, and Heart? Seawit. First, I would fain know, where that Woman breathes That can deserve a Man like me. Suppose She be a Vergin, alass! Poor green things, what Is she good for, why to steal Goosberries, And eat young Apricocks in May, before The Stones are hard. Or pick the Morter from An aged Wall, and swallow it most greedily. Joynture. If mirth be all your wealth, Sir, it were good You us'd it sparingly! Seawit. But for your wealth, 'tis no more then a Hermits, Compar'd with a Soldiers hopes. Imagine now The Wind stands fair, we hoyst up Sail, we meet A Persian Juncks, or Turkish Carrick, board her, Take her, and in her, force a Bashaw Prisoner, That hath a Diamond in his Turband, weighs (Let me see) about Six ounces! Joynture. Would the Bashaw Were here Captain, though lodg'd in the Majors house. Seawit. I would you were among your smooth curl'd Suitors That have little Beard, and less Brain, that have Estates, and are fit to be jeer'd. You think Y'are Mistress of a fine Wit, go, go home And keep it warm. Joynture. Methinks y'are angry Sir. Seawit. Be sure you eat no Philberts, nor green Cheese, They'll make you short winded, and so you'll lose Your fine conceits, for want of words to utter 'em. [Exit. Joynture. Well, I believe yet, the dainty Loveright, And this subtle Seaman, enterchange Kind opinions of each others heart: I'll cross it if I can; it is a fellow Of a strange spirit! Lord, how merry these Soldiers are without Money! I would I had him Safely made over by the Parish Priest. 'Tis here! Fitly contriv'd: Something I'll do, T'appear still scornful, and yet make him woo. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Enter Cable, a Porter. Cable. Come your affair, Squire of the Frock! Briefly Dispatch! Where is this courteous Damsel? Porter. At my House, Sir, it joyns to the Church-yard. Cable. O, I know the Mansion: It is a goodly Pallace! All Genoa has not such another: The Roof, as I suppose, is supported With a Mud-Wall, and it is Thatcht. Porter. I Sir! I built it in that year I was Collector for the poor, a profitable time, And I thank Heaven, I made good use of't. Cable. Well, to the point, does she praise my good parts, And tell thee too, that she knew me in London? Porter. She knew you by report, Sir, and hath heard A reverend Friend of hers, a Bawd, speak much In your behalf. Cable. There's never a Poor Gentleman In England, so much beholden to those Matronly people as I am: But proceed. Would she saidst thou, have me come to visit her. Porter. Truly Captain that's her request, and she's A modest Gentlewoman, she did so blush When she desir'd me, there might be no Body In the House when your Worship came to her. Cable. Is she handsome? But what a Leather-headed Dunce Am I, to ask thee; thou hast no skill in Beauty. Porter. How Sir, no skill? Cable. In nothing Sir, I take it, but the weight Of a Tray of Beef, when 'tis transported Through the Shambles, on your right shoulder. Go Commend me to her, say I am coming! Porter. I shall. Remember Sir 'tis hard by the Church. [Exit Porter. Cable. This is some London Punck, late fled from persecution. Enter Topsail. O are you come? Topsail. You see I am your willing follower? But what's the business you desir'd to intimate So privately! Seawit, and's hot disciple Are at hand, 'tis fit we prepare for action. Cable. I'll have no fighting Sir. Topsail. How Sir? Cable. I'll be as bold with you, as with my self, We are both fools, and Seawit in his care O'th' Ladies healths prescribes our fighting for Their Mornings mirth? Sir this is palpable. Topsail. But is this certain? But where is our revenge then? Cable. Troth to be serious in't will render us More fit for scorn, we'll use his own weapons, wit; Trust time and me! Topsail. There will be other treaties Sir, ere yet A truce be made between us. I must enjoy The Lady to my self, and you forgo Your hopes, and claim. Cable. Take her, she is thine Topsail. Topsail. Say you so Sir? Cable. Yes, and I'll ease your wonder too. There is a certain poor Twelve-penny Sinner Come from London, will serve my turn as well As any Lady in Europe; my Blood Is humble, nor have I the patience Sir T'expect or court, and then to be deny'd. This game is sure, and easie to be got. Enter Seawit, Inland. Inland. They are here Governor! By this day Gentlemen When we could not find you, we thought you had Been fighting in a deep Saw-pit; and how Dear Blades, how is't? Let's to it cheerfully Pelmel like loving friends. Topsail. Believ't Sir Furious, He had a hard heart would deny you any thing. Inland, Governor give me thy right hand! Because I ow thee for my breeding, and love thee tenderly, Observe me Governor. Seawit. I do dear Charge! Proceed. Inland. Go chuse which side thou wilt, and let's fall to't. Seawit. The proffer's fair, and full of courtesie. But Charge we must observe the Laws and Rules Of fight; Seconds were first ordain'd to be Spectators, and take care of an equality, And just demeanor in the Principals. Inland. Governor, I hope you will not use me thus. Seawit. Your Blood doth boil too much, pray cool't a while. These Gentlemen must both be search'd, and have Their counsel ask'd in the main cause, which as I told you, Charge is the just Laws of fight. Inland. Dispatch then Sir, or I will make new Laws. Seawit. You see Gentlemen, there's immaterial fire In him, not to be quench'd: How thrives your anger. Cable. Much like your wit, it is declining Sir! Towards our selves, and growing towards you. Seawit do not believe us still fit properties To wher your saucy fancy, and to make Your Ladies laugh. Topsail. Nor do not bait us with Your Whelp; for if he show his teeth, we shall So pull them out, that he will scarce be able To grind more Bisket. Seawit. Then you are both agreed? Cable. Not to be your fools, but to make you melancholly If you continue your sport. Topsail. Yes, and to drive your Charge unto his Kennel, Where he may keep company with's Hounds agen, Husband his Tillage, and pay you the Rent; You'll find more profit, and more safety too In that, then in your bold designs on us. Seawit. Troth I am glad! Cable. Of what I pray? Seawit. To see two fools converted without a Silenc'd Minister. You must be quarrelling, And like tall Men of War, fright poor Ladies With your love. 'Twas very comely, was't not? Cable. We commit our folly at our own cost. Topsail. And when we pay for't, we will have leave Sir To cast up our own accompt. Seawit. This I must signifie unto my Charge. Cable. Take your pleasure, for we will take ours Sir. Seawit. Oh Charge! Sad tidings Charge! Now shall I pierce Thy heart, more then thy Mistress sighs! Inland. Why, have they false Brest-plates? or Coats of Male on? Seawit. No, no, alas Charge, they are reconcil'd! Inland. O tame Devils, it is impossible! Seawit. Nay I exhorted 'em! Us'd all the power Of Friendship, and of Grace, took each aside And told 'em what a wicked thing it was To be pacifi'd without blood. Pleaded The cause with love and vehemence, as thus. Good Friends, dear Hearts, do but kill one another, Take care your Honor lies upon't, or do But order't so, that one may die. Inland. And the Slaves would not. Seawit. So far from it, That as I am a Soldier, they are ready To put out Money, and buy Annuities For life. Inland. Give room, I will assault them both. Cable. Let him come, he shall make less haste back again. Topsail. Yet take his choice too, and have single opposition. Inland. Unhand me Governorâ Seawit. Hear me a word, Let me but breathe a Secret in thine Ear, And take thy courseâ. Are these dull men Fit Combatants t'encounter thee in battle? Know Charge thou warm'st me With thy brave flame. I love thee Charge, and can Enjoy no rest, nor sleep, for taking care To provide thee quarrels: This happy hour Thou shalt defeat one of the Kings enemies. Inland. Where is he, let him in! Seawit. If I have truth about me Charge, this is The very point of time, wherein the Fo Threaten'd to approach! Inland. The Kings enemy! Let me kiss thee Governorâ Seawit. This morning I did incense the Dutch Captain To call you to account for striking him, And he hath sworn more oaths, then hours Past since, to send him a challenge. I wonder 'tis not come! Topsail. Farewel Sir Furious! Be rul'd by your Governor, And let your fellow subjects live. Cable. And when you kill, kill Hares, and purlue Deer, There's more sport in't. Seawit. Let them alone, th'are Justices of Peace. Inland. Rogues! Go tame Slaves: Your Swords are fitter for a Kitchin, then The War, they will serve to rost Larks upon. Topsail. Away, thou see'st he's mad! I'll to the Lady Loveright, and pursue my hopes. Cable. And I to my Girl of Cheapside. [Exeunt Cable, Topsail. Seawit. This was th'appointed place, 'tis strange he is Not come, O he has sent it by his Boatswainâ Enter Dutch Boatswain. Boats. Ick heb een brief veur den English Ruller! Seawit. Yaw, yaw dit is de selve Ruller. He has a Letter for you Charge. I'll enterpret. Inland. A challenge in Dutch from the Captain I beat on the Key. My bonny Burger how I affect thy Flanders Mettal. Read Governor. Seawit. Englishe Rullers warome hebb ghy myn up den Cop gheslachen? Ghy wete niet darome mot ghy sturone. So ghy willt accorderen wy mot up den Sea met we Scypen, vechten ghy synt nock een grooden Rutter, anders een Schellum dit is meen virendt ghet him te vele den plalse en den tyte Ne mier Hans van Bumble. This is the finest meddly of both Tongues Confus'd, that e'er I heard. Inland. What says he Governor? Seawit. English Knight, why have you cond me o'er the Pate? you know not: Therefore you must dye. If you'll agree, that we shall meet with several Ships, and fight it out at Sea, you are still a good Knight, otherways A Rogue. This is my Friend, give him to understand the time and place, no more, Hans van Bumble. Inland. My honorable Hans! my brave old Bumble, Why I do love thee more, then thou lov'st Butter! I will embrace thy long loose slopp, and kiss Thy drivell'd Beard, though drown'd in Breda Beere. Is this his Second, I'le fight with him too! Seawit. He'le be aboard his Captaines Ship! Believe It Charge, you'le have a shrewd fight on't. Inland. No matter! it is the Kings Enemy, And let the Cannons roar, 'tis fit our Soules Pass thorough a Smoak, ere they ascend the Clouds. I do begin to love him, whorson Herring-eater. Who'ld think that Fish would stir up so much mettall. Seawit. What shall I say unto this worthy Peere. Inland. Desire his Captaine meet me in this walke An houre hence, that we discourse friendly; And then appoint both time and place. Seawit. Secht tot de Capitaine so by belieft Strachens hier comen, Hy salt sier well ghtractect Weson: en dan de tyt en den plate weten. This Dutch comes forth like Treason on the rack! Boat. Ick verstoe ye ick verstoe ye. Ghoden dach! [Exit Boatsen. Inland. Governour, the World will eternise our Friendship; I cannot chuse but kneel to thee. [Kneels. This is the Kings Enemy, thou shalt lend me Thy Ship. Our amity is seal'd: no deniall. Seawit. Rise Charge!âDo not I know, that if I rigg My Cockboat, and arme thee with a Birding-piece, Thou wilt beate him. Inland. I, but the Winds may take his part, and in Foule weather, What's a Cock-boat to a Ship? Seawit. No more, we will discourse it as we walke. Here will be new vexation to rid me Of this request. Enter Nightingale. Night. My Lady, Sir, is much importunate To speak with you. Seawit. I shall attend you to her. More plots stirring? Come along Charge, thou shalt board this Hollander, And lead him Captive through Stafford-Town. [Exeunt omnes. A Curtain drawn by Dash (his Clerk) Trifle discover'd in his Study, Papers, Taper, Seale and Wax before him, Bell. Trifle. O are you come? 'Tis well, I was about To ring for you. Dash. Your Clients wait, dispatch, Sir. Trifle: They come for news; Man's nature's greedy of it. We wise Men forge it; and the credulous vulgar Our Instruments disperse it. I have it for'em. News of all sorts, and sizes. I have study'd hard Dash, And from the generall Courants, Gazets, Publick and private Letters from all parts Of Christendome, though they speak contraries, Weigh'd and reduc'd 'em to such certainties, That I dare warrant 'em authenticall. Under my hand, and seale. Captain, you are wellcome. Enter Topsaile. Topsaile. Your Friend Sir Solemne. Trifle. I shall give you proofs, And reall ones, I am yours. I have wrote here To one that will believe it first, then vent it In the Tavernes of Mark, and eating Acadamies, Frequented by the Gamesters, that you are Assur'd to my Lady Niece. Topsaile. Have you mov'd her for me, And got her grant? Trifle. No, I have not yet Spoke one word to her; but be confident She'le make it good, rather then I; her Uncle Shall suffer in my credit, for reporting A thing which was not. Topsaile. This is a weak foundation, For me to build on. Trifle. It shall pass for news, And I will make it true, this does appear strange news To your Captainship, but you shall hear stranger, And have it better'd too. Topsaile. Sure the Wind and noise He heard in my Ship, are humming in his head still. Trifle. Dash, call in Scarecrow, Zeale the wrong way, and Prattle, I will dispatch them first. But for the gull [Exit Dash. Your Seawit put upon me, I think I have taken A full revenge. Topsaile. Pray you in what, Sir Trifle? Trifle. I have writ to a Merchant, and I know it will be publisht On the Exchange, that he and his Charge, Sir Inland Were bastinado'd on the Key by a Dutchman, One Captain Bumble. Topsaile. This is quite contrary, Bumble was cudgell'd. Trifle. No matter, so it break His credit in the City, and undoe him. I have my ends. Topsaile. But, say he call you to accompt for't? Trifle. I am not bound to answer him being a Justice, And Duels too forbidden. Then in the Law 'Twill bear no Action. Topsaile. The more the pitty, This Priviledges cowardize, to wrong true valour. Trifle. Give me leave, you trouble me, matters of more weight Are to be treated of. If you would acquaint your friends, And at the first hand with the designes of Europe, Draw out your Table-books. Enter Dash, Scarcrow, Zeale, Pratle. Topsaile. What's here, Kent-street, Or Bedlam broke loose? Trifle. Contemne 'em not, they are usefull To propagate my designes, set 'em in file. Now hear with reverence. Scarcrow to you. You would know this Summers service? on my credit, (Though I grieve to report it) Rome is taken By the Ships of Amsterdam, and the Pope himself To save his life, turn'd Brownist. Here's a Letter From the Matron of the Curtezans that confirmes it. Scarr. May I swear this? Trifle. And get more Charities by it From your little ruffi'd Geneva-Man, or Flemming, They being apt to believe that which they wish for, Then by your lame-legg, or Passe-port. Topsaile. The first truth he spake to day. Trifle. Let me see. Here's something rarer But of undoubted truth. The Spanish Fleet That anchor'd at Gibralter, is sunk By the French Horse. Topsaile. This is rare indeed. Trifle. From Florence, All the Silk-wormes are dead, and an Edict made Unbenefic'd Ministers must give o're their Sattin, And Damask Cassacks, and weare Friers habits; Punks must not trade in Taffata's; Servingmen Must rip out the Plush intrailes of their Liveries, And lay 'em up for their Masters. From the Low-Countries; Antwerp is plunder'd, Brussels burnt, the Canon Brought before Lovaine, and the Prince of Orange Stands to be Emperour. Topsaile. The Emperour lives. Trifle. But is to die the Tenth of October next, And he has it in reversion. From France, Rochel recover'd by the Hugonets, And the fifth of July last, yes 'tis the fift. The Cardinal Richelieu as he slept in his Tent, Had his head cut off with an invisible Sword, By the great Constables Ghost. Topsaile. For shame give over. Trifle. This is all that's certain. Zeale. Antechrist is converted, That is enough, it will be joyfull tidings To the exil'd Congregation. Scar. May you lie long Sir. Trifle. How Rogue? Scar. Live I would say, and like your Worship. Trifle. I had forgot thee Prattle; thou shalt have thy dose too. Venus and Mars are in conjunction, here I finde it, and so often this drie year, That every Wench unmarry'd, that knows Man, Shall be seven times brought to Bed, and the Fathers name In Hebrew Characters, wrote on the Childes forehead. Prattle. No matter whose the Father, so I have work, And eate the Groaning Pie, and drink, and talke Over the Gossips Bowle, health to your Worship. [Exeunt Dash, Scarcrow, Zeale, Prattle. Trifle. This morning was well spent. Topsaile. It may serve for Ling. For the Devils breakfast. But what's your end Sir Trifle? Or the delight you take, if there be any In broaching these unpossible untruths? Trifle. All's true I assure you. Can the Gazets lie? Or the Corants faile? or grant it should be false, It will give satisfaction to the State, How the People stand affected; and for the pleasure Of publishing certain varieties, you call lies, I have another for't. But I'le dispatch you With my Neece, then tell you further. Topsaile. Make that truth. Though you lie your whole life after, I regard not. [Exeunt. Enter Porter and Cable. Porter. Is this the House. Cable. Thy house: the roof so poor. And the inside so rich! Impossible. Come, tell me truly, though you built it as you said now By cheating the poor Mans box. Where did you steale This gorgeous furniture. Porter. 'Tis my brave guests, Sir, To entertain your Captainship. And if You wonder at this, ere long you'l be astonisht. Cable. I am already. Fortunes coming towards me Faster then I durst hope for I am a made Man, I feel't with joy, this is no 12 penny Trade, That cozens the Marshall, under a pretence Of selling Ale or Tobacco, or two penny Pasties, Part Catt, part Mutton Porter. How he ruminates. Cable. It must be so, 'tis some rich wanton, that Hath heard of my strong performance, and e'en longs To beare a Boy of my begetting, for The maintenance of the Sport. Gramercie back, When drowth beggers Graziers, and much Rain poor Farmers, Thou art a sure revenue. Ha these are not [Musick. The Scrapers of the Town, that fright mens sleeps, And are paid in Chamberlie. Say they should be the Musitians Of the Lady Loveright, and she her self come hither To prove if the report be true goes of me. I must nor fear, nor hope too much A Song too, And a light note as I live, Porter. Pray you listen to it. A SONG. A Banquet brought in, Carrack following. Thrice happy he, who cares laid by Tasts pleasure with variety, That knows, and feelingly the bliss, To print a soft and melting kiss On his Saints Lips, With that delight Not to be nam'd but in the night. Such joyes wise nature doth prefer, While she's our guide, we cannot erre; The misers gold, the painted cloud Of Titles, that make vain men proud; The Courtiers pompe, or glorious Scarr Got by a Soldier in the Warr, Can hold no weight with his brave minde, That studies to preserve Mankinde, Which cannot be unless some houres Be freely spent within these bowers. Come boldly on then, fear not to begin That fight, which Jove himself held not a sin. Cable. Beyond belief! I dreame sure! prethee give me A tweake by the Nose, to assure me that I wake. Too hard you Rogue. Carrack. This shall come softer to you, And print a wellcome on your Lips. [Salute. Cable. Rare! Once more I pray you. Here's no Ambergris To help the foulness of the Lungs, your breath is As sweet as my Mothers Red Cowes. Carrack. Which you have kiss'd Sir. Cable. Every one as he likes. You know the Proverb. A delicate Doxie, there's fire in her eyes! A moist palme, which assures me that she will not Be satisfy'd with a Kickshaw. Venus assist me. If I do not my labour truly at the first, I am turn'd out of Service. Carrack. Pray you sit Sir. You are not merry. Cable. I'le laugh if you'le lie down: My appetite's sharp. I have kept a long Lent Lady. I need not your Eringos, I bring 'em with me, Or I can find 'em here, shall's to't? [Kissing her. Carrack. To the Banket: That follows by degrees. Or if you please We'le dance to stirr our blood. Cable. Fie no, no dancing. Look on my Bulk, I was not built for Capring I'le rather sit. Carrak. Fill Sirrah. How? in a Thimble? When I am to drink a health? A bigger Glass. To the good success of the Fleet. Cable. I like this well. [Pledges and drinks again. To my Pinnace Lady. Carrack. Is it well rigg'd? Cable. And sailes well. Carrack. You must not forget your friends. To every Ship A health, and then to bed. Cable. She'le make me drunk sure. Carrack. Ah Captain Flinch! Cable. Pray you let me sound a parly, The Third Grape is for Bacchus, not for Cupid. Besides if I am drunck I shall get Wenches, And I know you would have a Boy. Carrack. 'Tis that I aime at. Cable. Hear me a word. You are rich? Carrack. My Neighbours say so, And I have Lands. Cable. But held in Petticote tenure? I am bold with you Lady. Carrack. For that I effect you. Cable. I see you can drink, and dance. Can you sing me asleep too? Carrack. I had rather keep you waking, I hate a Dormouse. Cable. And you'le be private to me? Carrack. I'le know no man else. Cable. I am made for ever, and you'l indure my roughness? Carrack. The rougher the better. Cable. Let the Wind stay in this quarter Till all the victual be spent, nay the voyage lost, I am provided for. Let's to bed Wench. We prate too long. Carrack. Stay Sir, there is one Ceremony To be observ'd first, and then all is perfect. Cable. What Ceremony? Carrack. You must Marry me. Cable. Marry a Whore? I'le be Eunuch'd first. I begin To know that voice, and face. Porter. You have seen mine too, Her disguis'd Porter, Sir. Cable. I am fool'd on all sides. Carrack. Foole not your self. I do confess I love you, But love you honestly. Cable. There's Wormwood in That wicked word honesty. Carrack. You'le find it wholsome Captain, When you have digested it. You may perceive I can take any shape, or wayes to please you, And can maintain both too. You shall not build Upon uncertainties, as Dice or dead paies, Nor stand in fear of the Commissary my deare Cable, Nor talk of Monsters you have seen in the deeps For a dinner Captain, nor swear your self in credit With your Woollen Draper, or make his Wife your Agent For service done, or to be done, you shall not, if you marry me, And why should you refuse it? My breath's as sweet in an honest Womans habit As in a Strumpets, and my skin as smooth, and when you please May prove as well in Bed too. Cable. A taste of it first as thou art. Carrack. Not a bit Captaine. But if you do desire to be still a rambler Till you are so pepper'd, that you hate the sight of't, And then become a prey to your Apothecary, And defie your Chirurgion, or perhaps Be practis'd on in the Spittle, who can help it Both waies are markt before you, take your choice Be honest, and you may be rich, and happy. Continue a Whoremonger, and you know what follows. You may consider, and so farewell sweet Captain. [Exit. Porter. You look as you had labour'd hard, will you please To have a Cawdle Captain? I have seen One like you in a Play, after hot service, Spoon it upon the Stage. Cable. Avant you Rascall. What will become of me? no sport but on Such hard conditions? No meanes to take down My Mettle but a Priest? Must I be honest Against my will? And a Woman the first Temptress To eate forbidden Fruit, to fright me from it? Shall I steere this, or that way? yet I find My resolution wavering as the Winde. [Exit. Enter Bumble, an English Skipper. Bumble. De Tenfill! wat wilt tou Sechen. Skipper. I cannot bear this Captain. I have renounc'd England this Ten year, and serv'd in your ship Against my own Country, and still thus us'd! Bumble. War is de Botsen wÃ¼reom comet hy niet! Skipper. Why Sir your Botsen delivered your Message. To the young Knight. Bumble. Yaw well? wat secht de Knight? Skipper. Why Sir the Knight speaks lovingly, and desires To meet you a shore, and thank you for your Challenge: and then he will appoint the time And coast where you shall fight! This your Botsen Bad me tell you, who is now gone aboard To make things ready for the combat. Bumble. Ick veistoe. ick veistoe, Ick sall meet him on Schore. Mare you will oke veckten, allens de Rutter Is your Landsman. Skipper. I Sir, I'll help to kill him too, though we Are both born within a Musket shot, 'twere fit I should lose my Moneths pay else. Bumble. Dat is vele, dat is vele. Skipper. You'le meet him a'shore first in the morning? Bumble. Yaw, yaw, te morgben! comt 'tis goet Englishman. [Exeunt. Enter Warwell (a Paper in his hand) Warwell. Is this the Soldiers Character, that she Would have me imitate? Death on my hopes! I am abus'd, markt out the pleasure and The triumph of her scorne! Should I attend Her Laws, and by slow method and degrees, Raise up to that perfection she enjoynes: Or this strict written Scedule intimates, I might marry her but so late, that it. Were fit t'enter my Coffin, and her bed At once! I fear I am supplanted by Some Rival dearer in her Eyes. This is The Chamber of retreat: where she doth use To waste the hotter time of day in conference. My Nature and my Manners must consent A while, unlawfully to hide me here, That I may listen and observe. She comes. [He steps behind the Hangings. Enter Loveright, Jointure. Jointure. Madam, I do acknowledge you the best Remainder of our chiefest blood, and by That title, and your former love, you ought To challenge my respects: but not so much As shall restraine the freedome of my heart. Loveright. 'Tis no delight to me t'observe, and chide Your guilteness, but when it doth proceed To falsehood, and hypocrisie, I must speak. Joynture. Speak all your knowledge and your wrath; I shall Have power to vindicate my self. Loveright. You were the cautious Damsel that had read Moralitie, that lov'd not with your Eyes, But with your braine, and were your heart not in Your tender breast, but in your purse: Thrift was Your chief designe, and all your Lovers vertue was His Land. Soldiers were transitory things, Fitter to beget a Famine, then Children: That march o're others Lands, but never plough Their own. Jointure. And what would this inferr? Loveright. But little reputation unto you, That after all these documents could traine Seawit t'a private meeting in the Orchard: Although belov'd of me, and first my choice. Jointure. You have your Spies? Loveright. Yes, Orchard Spies? forsooth. Whilst you are gathering unlawfull fruit! Warwell. Patience, behold thou trivial god of Love, A stranger can imploy her envy, and Her strife, but I am cancel'd in her scorne. Enter Seawit. Jointure. Here comes the Gentleman; if you can show A charter to ingross the worthiest to Your self, or by his promise can assure Your interest more strong then mine, I will Disclaime my nuptiall hopes; and dance When Hymen celebrates your joyfull day. Loveright. Speak Sir, and with the fervency of truth, If to my Cousin here, you have ingag'd Th'assurance of your love, more then to me? Seawit. And is this the business I am sent for? Loveright. Is't not of consequence enough? freely Declare your self. I know your spirit is Too noble to disguise your thoughts. Jointure. And I with equal confidence, both of His vertue and his love, expect my doome. Seawit. D'you hear Gentlewomen, pack up your Ribbons, Your Lawne, your Pendants, and your Chains, with all The rest of your free Virginity Trinkets, and Get you gone out of the Harbor, or by This light I'le plant my Ship against your House, And batter the Walls about your small Eares. Loveright. Sir, this is strange, I am not guilty of Your anger. Jointure. Nor I, your own heart can witness. Seawit. Were you never beaten? never for stealing Conserves? never swadled for losing your Sleve silk, or making your work foule at Tent-stitch; Never for picking Plums out of Mince-Pies, Or breaking o'your Lutes through negligence. Had neither of you an old Grandmother With a short Ebon-staffe, that us'd to beat you For these faults? Sure, had you been ever beaten You would not dare to use me thus, Jointure. This was not wont to be; your envy Madam Hath thus incens'd and alter'd him to me. Loveright. My envy? In thy own false breast seek for The guilt with which thou striv'st to slander me. I know thy arts, but I will lay my self And fortunes at his feet 'ere thou shalt have him. Warwell. I cannot hold! Hear me fantastick Maid! Seawit. What another new Jigg to the old tune! Warwell. I now am learn'd in all thy falsehood, and Thy scornes, th'are such perhaps as may perplex Anothers love, now they are tir'd with mine; Know thou hast vex'd my nature, till't begin To rellish of the Devill, for all the Joyes I feel, is hope of fellowship in my Tormenting paines. Your Darling here may suffer too. Seawit. Excellent good! A male Conspirator. Warwell. Though you have fool'd me to a vaine destruction of My Mony, and my Books, my Land's still left, With which I shall endow one better try'd In constancy. Loveright. This is a rudeness, Sir, Not fit for to be forgiven, thus to intrude Into my privacies; but I'le divorce Me from your sight, let me behold you here No more. For you false Cousin, be you sure You are but little welcome to my Company, Therefore divide the House, this part is mine. Jointure. Mine the remotest from your eyes and sight. [Exeunt Loveright, Jointure, several wayes. Warwell. You Sir have the felicity to weare The Garland, and disdain it too. You see The Ladies strive who shall be first preferr'd Unto your choice, whil'st my poor wreath is Willow! Seawit. Of what Province I pray are you? What Bridegroome Are you? or what Kings Son that you should think I am oblig'd to bear this familiarity? You weare no Petticoat for priviledge! Warwell. I thank you Sir! and yet I scarce believe That you will make the Lady yours, and me So tame, to be your merriment: You shall not carry her With so much ease. Seawit. Agen! In good Faith hold your tongue, Or I shall run my Hilts between your teeth. Warwell. You can be angry then, some comfort yet That she hath plac'd her Love on one dares fight: Whose courage makes him fit to render me A satisfaction for her vantries. Seawit. You durst not be so merry sure, but that The house and Women must not be disturb'd. Warwell. Still pleasant with your fortune! Goe meet me If that thy Title, or thy Blood, dare prompt Thee to't, ith' Meadow Westward to the Sea. Simple, and guarded as thou art. Seawit. Lead on the way. Thy scarres are fit to be Rebuk'd. Thou noble Planet of the Day Showred when thou declin'st, as thou didst weare My anger in thy looks, thou being set May'st proudly rise unto the publick view Agen, but one of us or both, before Thy light is lost, shall sink, and rise no more.</field>

And now for Marmalad to close the stomack up; This morning I had news of a fiery Cutler That will greet me with a Ne exeat Regnum. Carrack. Just such a sad Man was my Husband wont To be in's youth, when he receiv'd Letters From London! and fac'd me out still, they came To borrow Money: Poor City-Souls, they sent But for their own. Cable. There's no returning to Town without Money, Unless I could move underground. For though I know each Lane And Alley, fit for Ambush, or Retreat; Yet the Serjeants know me better. Full many A sad gripe have I had on the Left-shoulder, And in the Kings name too. Fine Rogues, to use The Kings name to him, that has none of's Coyn! Well, I must turn chaste, marry my dear Widow, And be rich! No remedy! Carrack. Good morrow Captain! I am come to seek You out; and know how far you are resolv'd In the main point You understand me Captain? Cable. Widow! Would 'twere Sunday Widow! Carrack. And why, I pray? Cable.

But art thou sure he holds little power Over his Niece. Porter. That little is too much, Sir, He hath none at all. He may pretend she ows him Respects as to her Uncle, but I have heard Her Woman, Mistress Nightingale, (and she is The Key of her Ladies Secrets) swear her honor So hates her tedious babling, that she would part with A good round sum to have assurance, not To be afflicted with it but once a quarter. Topsail. That way I may do her service. But art thou perfect In my directions? Porter. If I miss my kue, Let me forfeit my reward. Topsail. Stand close, and when I hold my hand up thus, rush in upon him, And do thy office. Porter. With as much rudeness Captain, As a drunken Beadle drags a kneeling Begger To the House of Correction. Topsail. He appears, I'll have some sport, though I lose the Lady. Sir Solemne Trifle! Enter Trifle. Met to my wish I have dispatch'd my Letters To my friends in London, presuming on your promise, I shall have your Neece. [Porter aside. Trifle. Pray you give me leave. Topsail. Nay more, I have dispos'd of my Ship too. Trifle. Hear me, I pray you. Topsail. I build my confidence upon your credit, And if I fall, you perish in my ruines. Imagine, Sir, how monstrous 'twill appear If a grave Justice, add to that a Knight, Of such a reverend Beard, the Oracle Of Wisdom to his Brothers of the Bench, Nay their still open Mouth, a Statesman too, That holds intelligence in all the Courts Of Christendom, and from that frames his Counsels; I say, if such an eminent Man should fail In his assurances of a Ladies favor, His Neece, and one he may command, that will not Hazard the reputation of her Uncle, But with her own loss carefully preserve it. Who will give credit to your Hand and Seal, Touching occurrences far off? And therefore For your own sake, Sir Solemne, do me right, Or you are like to suffer. Trifle. I confess it An irrepairable loss. Now give me leave To make you understand, with what discretion, Art, judgment, Language, elegance of phrase, I have proceeded for you. Topsail. Briefly I pray you. Trifle. I went to her, and at the first receiv'd Slight entertainment, then I came upon her With my rhetorical flourishes, set you off In the full height of lustre, nay, observe How much I ventur'd for you. I assur'd her Upon my credit, That the next employment You should be chosen Admiral, then bring in The King of Spains Plate Fleet, and for the service Should be made an Earl. Topsail. I am bound to you. Trifle. And yet, Do you think she would believe me? Topsail. She had little reason. What wrought it on her? Trifle. Nothing as I live, all was cast away, nor gave I o'er so, But urg'd authority, and told her plainly Her Uncle was a Second-Father to her, And she bound to obey him. Topsail. What, reply'd she? Trifle. The Girl laugh'd at me, flung away, and will'd me To teach my Clerk Dash his trade, she was old enough To govern her own affairs. Topsail. Does this fruit grow On the Tree of your Assurances? Trifle. Captain Topsail, Preserve my reputation. Recal Your Letters by a Winged Post. I'll bear The charge, and undergo what loss soever You suffer'd in the parting with your Ship. Dear Sir, be good to me. I would not be taken In a lie for my estate. Topsail. You speak so honestly, That troth I could forget it; but suppose I should, I fear yet, you'll be call'd unto A strict accompt for the other news, to which You have set your Hand and Seal, and publish'd them By your subordinate Ministers. [Holds up his hand. Within Porter. Break ope the Doors. [Porter within. I'll have him, if he be above ground, though I raise the force of the County. Trifle. I begin to quake all over. Porter. Ah I am glad I have you. Sir Solemne Trifle, in the Kings name, I charge you T'obey my Warrant Topsail. Use him gently Pursuivant, Remember he's a Justice, and a Knight, He'll put in Bail. Porter. Bail will not serve, he must And shall along with me presently: I'll not take A Jury of Justices for his appearance. Trifle. I am undone. Porter. It is a kind of treason. Trifle. Ay me! Porter. He hath put the Kingdom in an uproar About his news, under his Hand and Seal. Topsail. Sir Solemne, I foresaw this. Porter. Scarcrow and Zeal Have kiss'd the Whipping-Post, and your Gossip Prattle, Hath tasted of the Rack for venting of Your trumperies, and the Rack will make him yield A reason why he holds intelligence Without Commission, and with Foreign Princes: You must and shall go Sir. Trifle. O Trifle, Trifle! What hath thy Pen, and Wisdom, brought thee too. Topsail. He will go quietly, tie not his Legs Under his Horses belly. Porter. As I see cause Sir. Trifle. Am I come to that, hear me, I am a Traytor In the highest degree. If e'er I had intelligence But from Play-houses, and Ordinaries, and sometimes Courants, Gazets, and Ballads, those were the Undoing Spirits I work'd by. [Weeps. Topsail. I believe him Troth Mr. Pursuivant, his fault may be Thought greater, then perhaps it is, and if A hundred pound in present pay, may teach you The Art of Connivance, do not see him till He hath su'd out his pardon. Porter. I shall run A dangerous hazard. Topsail. This is certainty. Give it him I say. Porter. For my security He must instantly leave the Town. Topsail. Besides the Warrant There's a necessity for that. Trifle. How Captain? Topsail. Seawit, I know not how, h'ath heard of the wrong You did him to his Marchant, and he hath vow'd To pull out your tongue, and cut off your right hand, No less will serve him. Trifle. I'll rather go with the Pursuivant. Porter. And be rack'd to death. Trifle. What shall I do? Topsail. Steal closely Out of the House; vanish as in a Mist That way. Not a syllable: on mine Honor [Exit Trifle. There's no Sir Solemne here. So, you are paid for Your Ship. Porter. The best that ever Porter was Sir. Topsail. This will I hope take off his edge of lying. And fright him to tell truth. Now for the Lady. [Exeunt. Enter Loveright, Joynture, Nightingale. Loveright. Mischief and shame upon thy silent Tongue? Why didst not tell me this before? Nightingale. Though I o'erheard their quarrel (Madam) I Believ'd they would proceed no further, then In words, but 'tis too certain, they were seen Just now hastning to the Field. Loveright. Quickly my Coach! In the adjoyning Meadow, Westward to th'Sea, did they appoint to meet? Nightingale. That was the place they nam'd. Loveright. You have enflam'd this anger (Cosin) by Perswading emulation in their love. Joynture. You wrong me (Madam) with a calumny That must result upon your self. Loveright. Within there Ho! My Coach. Joynture. Some call the Captains to assist us thither! Pray Heaven they do not fight. [Exeunt. Enter Seawit, Warwel in their Shirts. Stand at distance. Seawit. This Ground is equal to us both; or if Your better eyes can find a diff'rence in Ascent, you have the liberty of choice. Warwel. I like my station Sir, and you must joyn Some Fortune to your Strength, to move me hence. Seawit. You are as merry Sir, as if you thought Of nothing but a triumph, Warwel. Our weapons have one measur'd length: If you Believe the opposition of the Sun Unto your face, is your impediment, You may remove, and wear him on your back. Seawit. Your ceremonies, Sir, are troublesome. I love his Beams, if they can see me faint. 'Tis fit they punish me With Everlasting Night. Prepare your self. Enter Loveright, Joynture, Carrack, Nightingale, to Seawit and Warwel. Topsail and Cable following. Loveright and Nightingale hanging on Warwel. Joynture and Cable on Seawit. Seawit. Who have we here? Warwel. Your Land-plot Captain Seawit To fetch you off? Seawit. Your studied stratagem, Warwel, With your Confederate Lady Wits, you had paid else For your part of the jearing Scene. Warwel. I shall forget Civility, and Manners, if you persist thus. Have you first cast me off? abus'd my service? Then hold me while your Gallant cuts my Throat? Carrack. Do you think to fright me with your naked weapon? My Husband was A Captain, yet when he has drawn upon me In's drink, I have made him sheath his weapon, and Repent he drew it on me. Cable. Here's a fine medley. Seawit. We cannot do that which we came for, Sir, We must wait another hour, and till then truce, [Puts up his Sword. Silence becomes Men best, when Women talk. Warwel. I follow the example. Seawit. What new device Succeeds this, Madam Marchpain? Wherefore come you? And you her compeer? If you would both be cur'd Of the Green Sickness, and from me take Physick, Fall to it presently, and scratch one another Till you have torn off the Paint, and flesh together. I'll have no other fee. I am mad such baubles Should steal away my patience. When will it speak? Hath it lost its Tongue? Borrow an inch or two Of its Uncle Sir Solemne. Loveright. Ha! ha! ha! Is it angry? Or its pleasant wit tied up, and turn'd to railing? Joynture. Shall we put one Purl of our Gorgets out of order For such a face? Loveright. Or fight, or scratch, for a quibling A part of your Revenue? Carrack. Or I run mad, If I marry not this great Belly? or forswear sleeping, If it be not made my Pillow? Cable. I am brought in too. Loveright. But to be serious. Warwel. Which you cannot be. You have it not in your Nature, fickle Lady. Loveright. Be your own Judges for I'll speak my thoughts To all, and freely. But I am interrupted. Enter Inland. Quiet this storm, and I will give you reason For what we do, or have done. [Seawit, Warwel, Cable, Topsail, confer the Women, step aside. Inland. None kill'd yet? I have heard of the quarrel, and I will make one, I care not on which side. Ha! How comes this. Three Women 'gainst four Men! It must be so. I have read in Errant Books of fighting Ladies, And these no doubt are such, and I love 'em for't. They are disarm'd, the Men have got the day, And I stand bound to rescue 'em. Seawit. Second me 'twill do. Cable. We'll put him to't, and try his temper. Inland. You have been my Tutor, now I will be yours. You have wrong'd these Ladies, and my honor binds me To teach you better manners. Seawit. Thou weak Compound Of clownery and rashness, that ne'er knew'st, And art past reaching what true Valor is: Bridle your tongue, or I must tell you Boy, You will be whipt. Inland. Boy? I defie thee. Topsail. Stay Sir, Be not so hot, I must have some cool words with you. You have been saucy, and from my forbearance Grown insolent. I'll put you to the test. Fall off, and instantly, or I'll beat you to A place to do me right. Inland. Beat me, lead on. Cable. We must not part so. You Cub, I'll make you feel You are not now amongst your Tenants Sons, Swaggering at a Wake, in your own Village, Or stealing away a May-pole from your Neighbors; But with such Men, as if you dare but scratch, Can pare your Nails to the Stumps, and spoil your clawing. Inland. Three against one, 'tis foul play. Warwel. Thou art not worth The anger of one Boy that has true mettal, Or courage in him. Your love quarrelling, Be it right or wrong, and fighting as you say too. But look upon thy Sword. Topsail. Or frown. Seawit. Cast Lots Who shall do the drudgery of cudgelling him. Cable. You shall part with the name of furious, and from henceforth Be call'd Tame Inland. Joynture. How they aw him. Inland. Cow me with odds? Were your number ten times doubled, I would not budg. Ladies stand fair, you shall Perceive I am not aw'd, nor tongue-tied. Tutor, For my bringing up, I will dispatch you first; At your great Belly next. I will spoil your Pipe too. And you shall find I dare look on my Sword When I prick your Guts with't. Come one by one, or all Together, I care not. Cable. Sure the Devil's in him. Topsail. You must take another course. Seawit. I'll rather suffer, Then part with such a Charge. Warwel. I do recant. Seawit. Thou shalt be Our Admiral. Topsail. And kill the Kings Enemies By douzens. Cable. Be but reconcil'd. Inland. I am Upon these terms, but let me have enow Kings enemies to kill. Seawit. Thou shalt my Charge. Enter Boatswain. Boatsw. Aboard, aboard, the Wind stands fair, One sent too from the Admiral to command it. Cable. How! the Wind turn'd Westward? Topsail. 'Tis! the Rack runs that way. Seawit. Constantly. No stay then Your Lenvoy Ladies. Loveright. I will not hinder Your voyage with long discourse. This is the Man, For whose wisht sight, with some doubt to mine honor. I came to Plymouth, having had intelligence Four days before he had set Foot in Holland, And was bound hither. You had such entertainment, As I could give you: Other accidents Were but to pass time. I am serious Sir, And all imperious humors of a Mistress Cast by, I thus embrace you as a Husband, And as such, will obey you. Seawit. Heaven give you joy, Sir. Warwel. This satisfies for all, and if you please, Here ends our difference. Seawit. 'Tis my desire, Sir. Joynture. One word with you Sir. I shall still report you A Noble Gentleman, and am so chang'd With your behavior, though you want a fortune, At your return I'll make you one, and do it A lawful way. Seawit. I kiss your hand, and seal my self Your Servant. Cable. Now Widow, what's your doom Of me? Shall I stay at home, Or weigh up Anchors and be gone? Carrack. Get honor, And bring home a rich Prize, like my other Husband, And you shall have his place. Yet though you thrive not But come home ne'er so poor, forswear your whoring, And I am your Wife; and to encourage you to it, Give a particular of your debts, I'll pay 'em, You shall come home a free man. Cable. By this kiss I thank thee, I'll prove such a notable Husband Seawit. All stands yet in supposition. Topsail. I may find a Wife too At my return, till when Honor's my Mistress. Seawit. Our Navy now puts forth to Sea, and if You wish us a good voyage, we shall find Our new trim'd Sails fill'd with a prosp'rous Wind. [Exeunt.</field>
