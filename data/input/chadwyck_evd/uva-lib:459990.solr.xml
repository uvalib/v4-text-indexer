      <field name="fulltext">THE SIEGE OF DAMASCUS. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable EARL COWPER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. MILLS. Oft has the Muse here try'd her Magick Arts, To raise your Fancies, and engage your Hearts. When o'er this little Spot She shakes her Wand, Towns, Cities, Nations rise at her Command: And Armies march obedient to her Call, New States are form'd, and ancient Empires fall. To vary your Instruction and Delight, Past Ages roll renew'd before your Sight. His awful Form the Greek and Roman wears, Wak'd from his Slumber of Two Thousand Years: And Man's whole Race, restor'd to Joy and Pain; Act all their little Greatness o'er again. No common Woes To-night we set to View; Important is the Time, the Story new. Our opening Scenes shall to your Sight disclose How Spiritual Dragooning first arose; Claims drawn from Heav'n by a Barbarian Lord, And Faith first propagated by the Sword. In rocky Araby this Pest began, And swiftly o'er the Neighbour Country ran: By Faction weaken'd, and Disunion broke, Degenerate Provinces admit the Yoke. Nor stopp'd their Progress, till, resistless grown, Th'Enthusiasts made all Asia's World their own. Britains, be warn'd; let ev'n your Pleasures here Convey some Moral to th'attentive Ear. Beware lest Blessings long possest displease; Nor grow supine with Liberty and Ease. Your Country's Glory be your constant Aim, Her Safety all is yours; think yours her Fame. Unite at homeâforgo intestine Jars, Then scorn the Rumours of Religious Wars; Speak loud in Thunder from your guarded Shores, And tell the Continent, the Sea is Yours. Speak on,âand say, by War you'll Peace maintain, Till brightest Years, reserv'd for GEORGE's Reign, Advance, and shine in their appointed Round; Arts then shall flourish, plenteous Joys abound, And, chear'd by him, each Loyal Muse shall Sing The happiest Island, and the greatest KING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mr. WILKS. Well, Sirs; you've seen, his Passion to approve, A desperate Lover give up all for Love, All but his Faith.âMethinks now I can spy, Among you airy Sparks, some who wou'd cry, Phoo, Poxâfor thatâwhat need of such a Pother? For one Faith left, he wou'd have got another.â True: 'twas your very Case. Just what you say Our Rebel Fools were ripe for, t'other Day; Tho' disappointed now, they're wiser grown, And, with much Griefâare forc'd to keep their own. These generous Madmen gratis sought their Ruin, And set no Price, not they! on their Undoing. For Gain, indeed, we've others wou'd not dally, Or with stale Principles stand shilliâshall Iâ You'll find all their Religion in Change-Alley. There all pursue, by better Means or worse, Iago's Rule, Put Money in thy Purse. For tho' you differ still in Speculation, For whyâeach Head is wiser than the Nation, Tho' Points of Faith for ever will divide you, And bravely you declareânone e'er shall ride you: In Practice all agree, and every Man Devoutly strives to get what Wealth he can: All Parties at this golden Altar bow, Gain, pow'rful Gain's the new Religion now. But leave we thisâSince in this Circle smile So many shining Beauties of our Isle, Who to more generous Ends direct their Aim, And shew us Virtue in its fairest Frame; To these with Pride the Author bid me say, 'Twas for your Sex he chiefly wrote this Play; And if in one bright Character you find Superior Honour, and a Noble Mind, Know from the Life Eudocia's Charms he drew, And hopes the Piece shall live, that copies you. Sure of Success, he cannot miss his End, If ev'ry British Heroine prove his Friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. CHRISTIANS. Eumenes, Governor of Damascus. Mr. Wilks. Eudocia, his Daughter. Mrs. Porter. Herbis, his Friend, One of the Chiefs of the City. Mr. Williams. Phocyas, a Noble and Valiant Syrian, privately in Love with Eudocia. Mr. Booth. Artamon, an Officer of the Guards. Mr. Will. Mills. Sergius, an Express from the Emperor Heraclius. Officers, Soldiers, Citizens, and Attendants. SARACENS. Caled, General of the Saracen Army. Mr. Mills. Abudah, the next in Command under Caled. Mr. Thurmond. Daran, a wild Arabian, professing Mahometanism for the sake of the Spoil. Mr. Walker. Serjabil, Saracen Captain. Raphan, &amp;c. Saracen Captain. Officers, Soldiers, Attendants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, the City of DAMASCUS in Syria, and the Saracen Camp before it. And in the last Act a Valley adjacent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE The City. Enter Eumenes, follow'd by a Croud of People. Eumenes. I'll hear no more. Be gone! Or stop your clamorous Mouths, that still are open To bawl Sedition, and consume our Corn. If you will follow me, send home your Women, And follow to the Walls; there earn your Safety, As brave Men shou'd.âPity your Wives and Children? Yes, I do pity them, Heav'n knows I do, Ev'n more than You; nor will I yield 'em up Tho' at your own Request, a Prey to Ruffians.â Herbis, What News? Enter Herbis. Herb. News?âWe're betray'd, deserted; The Works are but half mann'd; the Saracens Perceive it, and pour on such Crouds, they blunt Our Weapons, and have drain'd our Stores of Death. What will you next? Eum. I've sent a fresh Recruit; The valiant Phocyas lead 'em onâwhose Deeds In early Youth assert his noble Race; A more than common Ardor seems to warm His Breast, as if he lov'd and courted Danger. Herb. I fear 'twill be too late. Eum. [Aside] I fear it too, And tho' I brav'd it to the trembling Croud, I've caught th'Infection, and I dread th'Event. Wou'd I had treatedâbut 'tis now too late.â Come, Herbis. [Exeunt. [A Noise is heard without, of Officers giving Orders. 1 Off. Help there, more Help! All to the Eastern Gate! 2 Off. Look where they cling aloft like cluster'd Bees! Here, Archers, ply your Bows. 1 Off. Down with the Ladders; What, will you let them mount? 2 Off. Aloft there! give the Signal, you that wait In St. Mark's Tower. 1 Off. Is the Town asleep? Ring out th'Alarum Bell! [Bell rings, and the Citizens run to and fro in Confusion. A great Shout. Enter Herbis. Herb. Soâthe Tide turns; Phocyas has driv'n it back. The Gate once more is ours. Enter Eumenes, Phocyas, Artamon, &amp;c. Eum. Brave Phocyas, Thanks! mine and the People's Thanks! [People shout, and cry, A Phocyas! &amp;c. Yet, that we may not lose this breathing Space, Hang out the Flag of Truce. You, Artamon, Haste with a Trumpet to th'Arabian Chiefs, And let them know, that, Hostages exchang'd, I'd meet them now upon the Eastern Plain. [Exit Artamon. Pho. What means Eumenes? Eum. Phocyas, I wou'd try By friendly Treaty, if on Terms of Peace They'll yet withdraw their Powers. Pho. On Terms of Peace? What Peace can you expect from Bands of Robbers? What Terms from Slaves, but Slavery?âYou know, These Wretches fight not at the Call of Honour; For injur'd Rights, or Birth, or jealous Greatness, That sets the Princes of the World in Arms. Base born, and starv'd amidst their stony Desarts, Long have they view'd from far, with wishing Eyes, Our fruitful Vales; our Fig-Trees, Olives, Vines, Our Cedars, Palms, and all the verdant Wealth That crowns fair Lebanon's aspiring Brows. Here have the Locusts pitch'd, nor will they leave These tasted Sweets, these blooming Fields of Plenty, For barren Sands, and native Poverty, 'Till driv'n away by Force. Eum. What can we do? Our People in Despair, our Soldiers harrass'd With daily Toil, and constant nightly Watch; Our Hope of Succours from the Emperor Uncertain; Eutyches not yet return'd, That went to ask them; One brave Army beaten; Th'Arabians numerous, cruel, flush'd with Conquest. Herb. Besides, you know what Frenzy fires their Minds Of their new Faith, and drives 'em on to Danger. Eum. True;âthey pretend the Gates of Paradise Stand ever open to receive the Souls Of All that die in fighting for their Cause. Pho. Then wou'd I send their Souls to Paradise, And give their Bodies to our Syrian Eagles. Our Ebb of Fortune is not yet so low To leave us desperate. Aids may soon arrive; Mean time, in Spight of their late bold Attack, The City still is ours; their Force repell'd, And therefore weaker; proud of this Success, Our Soldiers too have gain'd redoubled Courage, And long to meet them on the open Plain. What hinders then but we repay this Outrage, And sally on their Camp? Eum. Noâlet us first Believe th'Occasion fair, by this Advantage, To purchase their Retreat on easy Terms: That failing, we the better stand acquitted To our own Citizens. Howe'er, brave Phocyas, Cherish this Ardor in the Soldiery, And in our Absence form what Force thou can'st. Then, if these hungry Blood-Hounds of the War Shou'd still be deaf to Peace, at our Return, Our widen'd Gates shall pour a sudden Flood Of Vengeance on them, and chastise their Scorn. [Exeunt. SCENE changes to a Plain before the City. A Prospect of Tents at a Distance. Caled, Abudah, Daran. Dar. To treat, my Chiefs?âWhat! are we Merchants then, That only come to traffick with these Syrians, And poorly cheapen Conquest on Conditions? No; we were sent to fight the Caliph's Battles, Till every Iron Neck bend to Obedience. Another Storm makes this proud City ours; What need to treat?âI am for War and Plunder. Cal. Why so am Iâand but to save the Lives Of Mussulmans, not Christians, wou'd not treat. I hate these Christian Dogs; and 'tis our Task, As thou observ'st, to fight; our Law enjoyns it. Heav'n too is promis'd only to the Valiant. Our Prophet us'd to say, the happy Plains Above, lye stretch'd beneath the Blaze of Swords. Abu. Yet-Daran's loath to trust that Heav'n for Pay: This Earth, it seems, has Gifts that please him more. Cal. Check not his Zeal, Abudah. Abu. No; I praise it. Yet I cou'd wish that Zeal had better Motives. Has Victory no Fruits but Blood and Plunder? That we were sent to fight, 'tis true; but wherefore? For Conquest, not Destruction. That obtain'd, The more we spare, the Caliph has more Subjects, And Heav'n is better serv'd.âBut see, they come. Enter Eumenes, Herbis, Artamon. Cal. Well, Christians, we are metâand War awhile, At your Request, has still'd its angry Voice, To hear what you'll propose. Eum. We come to know, After so many Troops you've lost in vain, If you'll draw off in Peace, and save the rest. Herb. Or rather to know firstâfor yet we know notâ Why on your Heads you call our pointed Arrows, In our own just Defence? What means this Visit? And why we see so many thousand Tents Rise in the Air, and whiten all our Fields? Cal. Is that a Question now?âyou had our Summons, When first we march'd against you, to surrender. Two Moons have wasted since, and now the third Is in its Wane. 'Tis true, drawn off awhile, At Aiznadin we met and fought the Powers Sent by your Emperor to raise our Siege. Vainly you thought us gone; we gain'd a Conquest. You see we are return'd; our Hearts, our Cause, Our Swords the same. Herb. But why those Swords were drawn, And what's that Cause, inform us. Eum. Speak your Wrongs, If Wrongs you have receiv'd, and by what Means They may be now repair'd. Abu. Then, Christians, hear! And Heav'n inspire you to embrace its Truth! Not Wrongs t'avenge, but to establish Right Our Swords were drawn. For such is Heav'n's Command Immutable. By us great Mahomet, And his Successor, holy Abubeker, Invite you to the Faith. Artam. [aside.] Soâthen it seems There's no Harm meant; we're only to be beaten Into a new Religion.âIf that's all, I find I am already half a Convert. Eum. Now in the Name of Heav'n, what Faith is this That stalks Gigantick forth thus arm'd with Terrors, As if it meant to Ruin, not to Save? That leads embattel'd Legions to the Field, And marks its Progress out with Blood and Slaughter? Herb. Bold frontless Men! that impudently dare To blend Religion with the worst of Crimes! And sacrilegiously have stol'n that Name To cover Frauds, and justifie Oppression! Eum. Where are your Priests? What Doctors of your Law Have you e'er sent, t'instruct us in its Precepts? To solve our Doubts, and satisfie our Reason, And kindly lead us thro' the Wilds of Error To these new Tracks of Truth?âThis wou'd be Friendship, And well might claim our Thanks. Cal. Friendship like this With Scorn had been receiv'd; your numerous Vices, Your clashing Sects, your mutual Rage and Strife Have driv'n Religion, and her Angel-Guards, Like Out-casts from among you. In her stead, Usurping Superstition bears the Sway, And reigns in mimick State, 'midst Idol Shews, And Pageantry of Pow'r. Who does not mark Your Lives? Rebellious to Heav'n's gentler Precepts That mildly taught youâtherefore Mahomet Has brought the Sword to govern you by Force, Nor will accept Obedience so precarious. Eum. O solemn Truths! tho' from an impious Tongue! [Aside. That we're unworthy of our holy Faith, To Heav'n with Grief and conscious Shame we own. But what are you, that thus arraign our Vices, And consecrate your own? Vile Hypocrites! Are you not Sons of Rapine, Foes to Peace, Base Robbers, Murderers?â Cal. Christian, Noâ Eum. Then say Why have you ravag'd all our peaceful Borders? Plunder'd our Towns? and by what Claim ev'n now You tread this Ground? Herb. What Claim, but that of Hunger? The Claim of ravenous Wolves, that leave their Dens To prowl at Midnight round some sleeping Village, Or watch the Shepherd's folded Flock for Prey? Cal. Blasphemers, know, your Fields and Towns are ours. Our Prophet has bestow'd 'em on the Faithful, And Heav'n has ratify'd the Grant above. Eum. Oh! now indeed you boast a noble Title! What cou'd your Prophet grant? a Hireling Slave! Not ev'n the Mules and Camels which he drove Were his to give; and yet the bold Impostor Has canton'd out the Kingdoms of the Earth, In frantick Fits of visionary Power, To sooth his Pride, and bribe his Fellow-Madmen! Cal. Was it for this you sent to ask a Parley, T'affront our Faith, and to traduce our Prophet? Well might we answer you with quick Revenge For such Indignities.âYet hear once more, Hear this our last Demand; and this accepted We yet withdraw our War. Be Christians still, But swear to live with Us in firm Alliance, To yield Us Aids, and pay Us annual Tribute. Eum. No;âShou'd we grant you Aid, we must be Rebels; And Tribute is the slavish Badge of Conquest. Yet since on just and honourable Terms, We ask but for our own,âTen silken Vests, Weighty with Pearl and Gemms, we'll send your Caliph; Two, Caled, shall be thine; two thine, Abudah. To each inferior Captain we decree A Turbant, spun from our Damascus' Flax White as the Snows of Heav'n; to every Soldier A Scimitar. This, and of solid Gold Ten Ingots, be the Price to buy your Absence. Cal. This, and much more, ev'n all your shining Wealth Will soon be ours; Look round your Syrian Frontiers! See, in how many Towns our hoisted Flaggs Are waving in the Wind; Sachna, and Hawran, Proud Tadmor, Aracah, and stubborn Bosra Have bow'd beneath the Yoke;âBehold our March O'er half your Land, like Flame thro' Fields of Harvest. And lastâviewâAiznadin, that Vale of Blood! There seek the Souls of forty thousand Greeks That, fresh from Life, yet hover o'er their Bodies. Then think, and then resolve. Herb. Presumptuous Men! What tho' you yet can boast successful Guilt Is Conquest only yours? Or dare you hope That you shall still pour on the swelling Tide, Like some proud River that has left its Banks, Nor ever know Repulse? Eum. Have you forgot? Not twice seven Years are past since ev'n your Prophet, Bold as he was, and boasting Aid Divine, Was by the Tribe of Corash forc'd to fly, Poorly to fly, to save his wretched Life, From Mecca to Medina? Abu. No;âforgot? We well remember how Medina skreen'd That holy Head, preserv'd for better Days, And ripening Years of Glory! Dar. Why, my Chiefs, Will you waste Time, in offering Terms despis'd To these Idolaters?âWords are but Air, Blows wou'd plead better. Cal. Daran, thou say'st true. Christians, here end our Truce. Behold once more The Sword of Heav'n is drawn! Nor shall be sheath'd But in the Bowels of Damascus. Eum. That, Or speedy Vengeance, and Destruction due To the proud Menacers, as Heav'n sees fit! [Exeunt severally. SCENE Changes to a Garden. Eudocia. All's hush'd around!âNo more the Shouts of Soldiers And Clash of Arms tumultuous fill the Air. Methinks this Interval of Terror seems Like that when the loud Thunder just has roll'd O'er our affrighted Heads, and in the Heav'ns A momentary Silence but prepares A second and a louder Clap to follow. Enter Phocyas. O noâmy Heroe comes, with better Omens, And every gloomy Thought is now no more. Pho. Where is the Treasure of my Soul?âEudocia, Behold me here impatient, like the Miser That often steals in secret to his Gold, And counts with trembling Joy, and jealous Transport, The shining Heaps which he still fears to lose. Eud. Welcome thou brave, thou best deserving Lover! How do I doubly share the common Safety, Since 'tis a Debt to thee!âbut tell me, Phocyas, Dost thou bring Peace?âthou dost, and I am happy! Pho. Not yet, Eudocia; 'tis decreed by Heav'n I must do more to merit thy Esteem. Peace, like a frighted Dove, has wing'd her Flight To distant Hills, beyond these Hostile Tents; And thro' 'em we must thither force our Way, If we wou'd call the lovely Wanderer back To her forsaken Home. Eud. False flattering Hope! Vanish'd so soon!âalas, my faithful Fears Return, and tell me We must still be wretched! Pho. Not so, my Fair; if thou but gently smile, Inspiring Valour, and presaging Conquest, These barbarous Foes to Peace and Love shall soon Be chas'd, like Fiends before the Morning Light, And all be calm again. Eud. Is the Truce ended! Must War, alas, renew its bloody Rage? And Phocyas ever be expos'd to Danger? Pho. Think for whose sake Danger it self has Charms. Dismiss thy Fears; the lucky Hour comes on, Full fraught with Joys, when my big Soul no more Shall labour with this Secret of my Passion, To hide it from thy jealous Father's Eyes. Just now, by Signals from the Plain, I've learn'd That the proud Foe refuse us Terms of Honour; A Sally is resolv'd; the Citizens And Soldiers, kindled into sudden Fury, Press all in Crouds, and beg I'll lead 'em on. O my Eudocia! If I now succeedâ Did I say IfâI must, I will; the Cause Is Love, 'tis Liberty, it is Eudocia!â What then shall hinder, since our mutual Faith Is pledg'd, and thou consenting to my Bliss, But I may boldly ask thee of Eumenes, Nor fear a Rival's more prevailing Claim? Eud. May Blessings still attend thy Arms!âMethinks I've caught the Flame of thy Heroick Ardor! And now I see thee crown'd with Palm and Olive; The Soldiers bring thee back with Songs of Triumph And loud applauding Shouts; thy rescu'd Country Resounds thy Praise; our Emperor Heraclius Decrees thee Honours for a City sav'd, And Pillars rise of Monumental Brass Inscrib'dâTo Phocyas the Deliverer. Pho. The Honours and Rewards which thou hast nam'd Are Bribes too little for my vast Ambition. My Soul is full of thee!âThou art my All Of Fame, of Triumph, and of future Fortune. 'Twas Love of thee first sent me forth in Arms, My Service all is thine, to thee devoted, And thou alone canst make ev'n Conquest pleasing. Eud. O do not wrong thy Merit, nor restrain it To narrow Bounds; but know, I best am pleas'd To share thee with thy Country. O my Phocyas! With conscious Blushes oft I've heard thy Vows, And strove to hide, yet more reveal'd my Heart; But 'tis thy Virtue justifies my Choice, And what at first was Weakness, now is Glory. Pho. Forgive me, thou fair Pattern of all Goodness! If in the Transport of unbounded Passion, I still am lost to ev'ry Thought but Thee. Yet sure to love thee thus is ev'ry Virtue; Nor need I more PerfectionâHark! I'm call'd. [Trumpet sounds. Eud. Then goâand Heav'n with all its Angels guard thee. Pho. Farewell!âfor thee once more I draw the Sword. Now to the Field, to gain the glorious Prize; 'Tis Victoryâthe Word; Eudocia's Eyes! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE The Governor's Palace. Eumenes, Herbis. Herbis. Still I must say 'twas wrong, 'twas wrong, Eumenes, And mark th'Event! Eum. What cou'd I less? You saw 'Twas vain t'oppose it, whilst his eager Valour, Impatient of Restraintâ Herb. His eager Valour? His Rashness, his hot Youth, his Valour's Feaver! Must we, whose Business is to keep our Walls, And manage warily our little Strength, Must we at once lavish away our Blood, Because his Pulse beats high, and his mad Courage Wants to be breath'd in some new Enterprize?â You shou'd not have consented. Eum. You forget, 'Twas not my Voice alone; you saw, the People (And sure such sudden Instincts are from Heav'n!) Rose all at once to follow him, as if One Soul inspir'd 'em, and that Soul were Phocyas. Herb. I had indeed forgot; and ask your Pardon. I took you for Eumenes, and I thought That in Damascus you had chief Command. Eum. What dost thou mean? Herb. Nay, who's forgetful now? You say, the PeopleâYes, that very People, That Coward Tribe that press'd you to surrender! Well may they spurn at lost Authority; Whom they like better, better they'll obey. Eum. O I cou'd curse the giddy changeful Slaves, But that the Thought of this Hour's great Event Possesses all my Soul.âIf we are beaten!â Herb. The Poison works; 'tis wellâI'll give him more. [Aside. True, if we're beaten, who shall answer that? Shall you, or I?âAre you the Governor?â Or say we conquer, whose is then the Praise? Eum. I know thy friendly Fears; that thou and I Must stoop beneath a beardless rising Heroe; And in Heraclius' Court it shall be said, Damascus, nay perhaps the Empire too, Ow'd its Deliverance to a Boy.âWhy, be it, So that he now return with Victory; 'Tis Honour greatly won, and let him wear it. Yet I cou'd wish I needed less his Service. Were Eutyches return'dâ Herb. [Aside.] That, that's my Torture. I sent my Son to th'Emperor's Court, in Hopes His Merit at this time might raise his Fortunes; But Phocyas Curse upon his forward Virtues!â Is reaping all this Field of Fame alone, Or leaves him scarce the Gleanings of a Harvest. Eum. See, Artamon with hasty Strides returning! He comes alone!âO Friend, thy Fears were just. What are we now, and what is lost Damascus? Enter Artamon. Art. Joy to Eumenes! Eum. Joy?âis't possible? Dost thou bring News of Victory? Art. The Sun Is set in Blood, and from the Western Skies Has seen three thousand slaughter'd Arabs fall. Herb. Is Phocyas safe? Art. He is, and crown'd with Triumph. Herb. [Aside.] My Fears indeed were just. [Shout, A Phocyas, a Phocyas! Eum. What Noise is that? Herb. The People worshiping their new Divinity. Shortly they'll build him Temples. Eum. Tell us, Soldier, Since thou hast shar'd the Glory of this Action, Tell us how it began. Art. At first the Foe Seem'd much surpris'd; but taking soon th'Alarm Gather'd some hasty Troops, and march'd to meet us. The Captain of these Bands look'd wild and fierce, His Head unarm'd, as if in Scorn of Danger, And naked to the Waste; as he drew near He rais'd his Arm, and shook a pondrous Lance; When all at once, as at a Signal giv'n, We heard the Tecbir, so these Arabs call Their Shouts of Onset, when with loud Appeal They challenge Heav'n, as if demanding Conquest. The Battle join'd, and thro' the barbarous Host Fight, Fight, and Paradise was all the Cry. At last our Leaders met; and gallant Phocyasâ But what are Words to tell the mighty Wonders We saw him then perform?âtheir Chief unhors'd, The Saracens soon broke their Ranks, and fled; And had not a thick Evening Fog arose (Which sure the Dev'l rais'd up to save his Friends!) The Slaughter had been doubleâBut, behold! The Heroe comes. Enter Phocyas. Eumenes meeting him. Eum. Joy to brave Phocyas! Eumenes gives him back the Joy he sent. The welcome News has reach'd this Place before thee. How shall thy Country pay the Debt she owes thee? Pho. By taking this as Earnest of a Debt Which I owe her, and fain wou'd better pay. Herb. In spight of Envy, I must praise him too. [Aside. Phocyas, thou hast done bravely, and 'tis fit Successful Virtue take a time to rest. Fortune is fickle, and may change; besides, What shall we gain, if from a mighty Ocean By Sluices we draw off some little Streams? If thousands fall, ten thousands more remain. Nor ought we hazard Worth so great as thine Against such Odds; suffice what's done already And let us now, in hope of better Days, Keep wary Watch, and wait th'expected Succours. Pho. What!âto be coop'd whole Months within our Walls? To rust at home, and sicken with Inaction? The Courage of our Men will droop and die, If not kept up by daily Exercise. Again the beaten Foe may force our Gates; And Victory, if slighted thus, take Wing, And fly where she may find a better Welcome. Art. [Aside.] It must be soâhe hates him! On my Soul, This Herbis is a foul old envious Knave. Methinks Eumenes too might better thank him. Eum. [to Herbis. Aside.] Urge him no more;âI'll think of thy late Warning, And thou shalt see I'll yet be Governor. A Letter brought in. Phocyas [looking on it.] 'Tis to Eumenes. Eum. Ha!âfrom Eutyches. Reads.] âThe Emperor, awaken'd with the Danger âThat threatens his Dominions, and the Loss âAt Aiznadin, has drain'd his Garrisons âTo raise a second Army. In few Hours âWe shall begin our March. Sergius brings this, âAnd will inform you furtherâ Herb. [Aside.] Heav'n, I thank thee! 'Tis ev'n beyond my Hopes. Eum. But where is Sergius? Messenger. The Letter, fasten'd to an Arrow's Head, Was shot into the Town. Eum. I fear he's taken.â O Phocyas, Herbis, Artamon! my Friends! You all are Sharers in this News; the Storm Is blowing o'er, that hung like Night upon us, And threaten'd deadly Ruin.âHaste, proclaim The welcome Tidings loud thro' all the City. Let sparkling Lights be seen from ev'ry Turret To tell our Joy, and spread their Blaze to Heav'n! Prepare for Feasts; Danger shall wait at Distance, And Fear be now no more. The jolly Soldier And Citizen shall meet o'er their full Bowls, Forget their Toils, and laugh their Cares away, And Mirth and Triumphs close this happy Day. [Exeunt Herb. and Art. Pho. And may succeeding Days prove yet more happy! Well dost thou bid the Voice of Triumph sound Thro' all our Streets; our City calls thee Father; And say, Eumenes, dost thou not perceive A Father's Transport rise within thy Breast, Whilst in this Act thou art the Hand of Heav'n To deal forth Blessings, and distribute Joy? Eum. The Blessings Heav'n bestows are freely sent, And shou'd be freely shar'd. Pho. True;âGenerous Minds Redoubled feel the Pleasures they impart. For me, if I've deserv'd by Arms or Councils, By Hazards gladly sought, and greatly prosper'd, Whate'er I've added to the publick Stock, With Joy I see it in Eumenes' Hands, And wish but to receive my Share from thee. Eum. I cannot, if I wou'd, withhold thy Share. What thou hast done is thine; the Fame thy own; And virtuous Actions will reward themselves. Pho. Fame?âWhat is that, if courted for herself? Less than a Vision; a meer Sound, an Echo, That calls with mimick Voice thro' Woods and Labyrinths Her cheated Lovers; lost and heard by Fits, But never fix'd; a seeming Nymph, yet Nothing. Virtue indeed is a substantial Good, A real Beauty; yet with weary Steps Thro' rugged Ways, by long laborious Service, When we have traced, and wooed, and won the Dame, May we not then expect the Dower she brings? Eum. Wellâask that Dower; say, can Damascus pay it? Her Riches shall be tax'd, name but the Sum, Her Merchants with some costly Gemms shall grace thee. Nor can Heraclius fail to grant thee Honours, Proportion'd to thy Birth and thy Desert. Pho. And can Eumenes think I wou'd be bribed By Trash, by sordid Gold, to venal Virtue? What! serve my Country for the same mean Hire That can corrupt each Villain to betray her? Why is she sav'd from these Arabian Spoilers, If to be stripp'd by her own Sons?âforgive me If the Thought glows upon my Cheeks; I know 'Twas mention'd, but to prove how much I scorn it. As for Heraclius, if he own my Conduct, I shall indulge an honest Pride in Honours Which I have strove to merit. Yes, Eumenes, I have Ambitionâyet the vast Reward That swells my Hopes, and equals all my Wishes Is in thy Gift aloneâit is Eudocia. Eum. Eudocia?âPhocyas, I am yet thy Friend, And therefore will not hold thee long in Doubt. Thou must not think of herâ Pho. Not think of Her? Impossible!âShe's ever present to me, My Life, my Soul; She animates my Being, And kindles up my Thoughts to worthy Actions. And why, Eumenes, why not think of Her? Is not my Rankâ Eum. Forbearâwhat need a Herald To tell me who thou art?âYet once againâ Since thou wilt force me to a Repetition, I say, thou must not think of Her. Pho. Yet hear me; Why wilt thou judge, e'er I can plead my Cause? Eum. Why wilt thou plead in vain? hast thou not heard My Choice has destin'd her to Eutyches! Pho. And has she then consented to that Choice? Eum. Has She consented?âWhat is her Consent? Is She not mine? Pho. She isâand in that Title Ev'n Kings with Envy may behold thy Wealth, And think their Kingdoms poor!âand yet, Eumenes, Shall She, by being thine, be barr'd a Privilege Which ev'n the meanest of her Sex may claim? Thou wilt not force Her?â Eum. Who has told thee so? I'd force her to be happy. Pho. That thou canst not. What Happiness subsists in Loss of Freedom? The Guest constrain'd but murmurs at the Banquet, Nor thanks his Host, but starves amidst Abundance. Eum. 'Tis well, young Man!âWhy then I'll learn from thee To be a very tame obedient Father. Thou hast already taught my Child her Duty. I find the Source of all her Disobedience, Her Hate of me, her Scorn of Eutyches; Ha! is't not so?âcome tell me; I'll forgive thee. Hast thou not found her a most ready Scholar? I know thou hastâwhy, what a dull old Dotard Was I, to think I ever had a Daughter! Pho. I'm sorry that Eumenes thinksâ Eum. NoâSorry? Sorry for what? then thou dost own thou'st wrong'd me! That's somewhat yetâCurse on my stupid Blindness! For had I Eyes I might have seen it sooner. Was this the Spring of thy romantick Bravery, Thy boastful Merit, thy officious Service? Pho. It wasâwith Pride I own itâ'twas Eudocia! I have serv'd Thee in serving Her, thou know'st it, And thought I might have found a better Treatment. Why wilt thou force me thus to be a Braggard, And tell thee that which thou shou'dst tell thy self? It grates my SoulâI am not wont to talk thus. But I recall my WordsâI have done nothing, And wou'd disclaim all Merit but my Love. Eum. O noâsay on, that thou hast sav'd Damascus, Is it not so?âLook o'er her Battlements, See, if the flying Foe have left their Camp! Why are our Gates yet clos'd, if thou hast freed Us? 'Tis true, thou fought'st a Skirmishâwhat of that? Had Eutyches been presentâ Pho. Eutyches! Why wilt thou urge my Temper with that Trifler? O let him come! that in yon spacious Plain We may together charge the thickest Ranks, Rush on to Battle, Wounds, and glorious Death, And prove who 'twas that best deserv'd Eudocia. Eum. That will be seen ere longâbut since I find Thou arrogantly wou'dst usurp Dominion, Believ'st thy self the Guardian Genius here, And that our Fortunes hang upon thy Sword; Be that first try'dâfor know, that from this Moment Thou here hast no CommandâFarewel!âSo stay, Or hence and joyn the Foeâthou hast thy Choice. [Ex. Eumenes. Pho. Spurn'd and degraded!âproud ungrateful Man! Am I a Bubble then, blown up by thee, And toss'd into the Air to make thee Sport? Hence to the Foe? 'tis wellâEudocia, O I will see thee, thou wrong'd Excellence! But how to speak thy Wrongs, or my Disgrace? ImpossibleâO rather let me walk Like a dumb Ghost, and burst my Heart in Silence. SCENE the Garden. Enter Eudocia. Eud. Why must we meet by Stealth, like guilty Lovers? But 'twill not long be soâWhat Joy 'twill be To own my Heroe in his ripen'd Honours, And hear applauding Crouds pronounce me blest!â Sure he'll be hereâSee! the fair rising Moon, E'er Day's remaining Twilight scarce is spent, Hangs up her ready Lamp, and with mild Lustre Drives back the hovering Shades! Come, Phocyas, come; This gentle Season is a Friend to Love, And now methinks I cou'd, with equal Passion Meet thine, and tell thee all my secret Soul. Enter Phocyas. He hears meâO my Phocyas!âWhat?ânot answer?â Art thou not He? or art some Shadow?âspeak. Pho. I am indeed a ShadowâI am nothingâ Eud. What dost thou mean?âfor now I know thee, Phocyas. Pho. And never can be thine. It will have ventâO barbarous, curstâbut holdâ I had forgot,âit was Eudocia's Father!â O cou'd I too forget how he has us'd me! Eud. I fear to ask theeâ Pho. Dost thou fear?âAlas! Then thou wilt pity meâO generous Maid! Thou hast charm'd down the Rage that swell'd my Heart, And choak'd my Voiceânow I can speak to thee. And yet 'tis worse than Death what I have suffer'd; It is the Death of Honour!âYet that's little; 'Tis more, Eudocia, 'tis the Loss of thee! Eud. Hast thou not conquer'd?âWhat are all these Shouts, This Voice of general Joy heard far around? What are these Fires, that cast their glimmering Light Against the Sky? Are not all these thy Triumph? Pho. O name not Triumph! talk no more of Conquest! It is indeed a Night of general Joy, But not to me; Eudocia, I am come To take a last Farewel of thee for ever. Eud. A last Farewel? Pho. Yes;âHow wilt thou hereafter Look on a Wretch despis'd, revil'd, cashier'd, Strip'd of Command, like a base beaten Coward? Thy cruel FatherâI have told too much;â I shou'd not but for this have felt the Wounds I got in Fight for himânow, now they bleed. But I have doneâand now thou hast my Story, Is there a Creature so accurst as Phocyas? Eud. And can it be?âIs this then thy Reward? O Phocyas! never wou'dst thou tell me yet That thou hadst Wounds; Now I must feel them too. For is it not for me thou hast born this? What else cou'd be thy Crime?âwert thou a Traytor, Hadst thou betray'd us, sold us to the Foeâ Pho. Wou'd I be yet a Traytor, I have leave; Nay, I am dar'd to it with mocking Scorn. My Crime indeed was asking thee; That only Has cancell'd all, if I had any Merit; The City now is safe, my Service slighted, And I discarded like an useless Thing, Nay, bid be goneâand, if I like that better, Seek out new Friends, and join yon barbarous Host. Eud. Holdâlet me think a whileâ [Walks aside. âTho' my Heart bleed, I wou'd not have him see these dropping Tears.â And wilt thou go then, Phocyas? Pho. To my Grave; Where can I bury else this foul Disgrace? Alas! that Question shews how poor I am, How very much a Wretch, for if I go, It is from thee, thou only Joy of Life! And Death will then be welcome. Eud. Art thou sure Thou hast been us'd thus?âArt thou quite undone? Pho. Yes, very sureâWhat dost thou mean? Eud. That then, it is a Time for meâO Heav'n! that I Alone am grateful to this wondrous Man!â To own thee Phocyas, thusânay, glory in thee, [Giving her Hand.] And shew, without a Blush, how much I love. We must not partâ Pho. Then am I rich again! [Embracing her. O noâwe will not part!âconfirm it, Heav'n! Now thou shalt see how I will bend my Spirit, With what soft Patience I will bear my Wrongs, Till I have weary'd out thy Father's Scorn. Yet I have worse to tell theeâEutychesâ Eud. Why wilt thou name him? Pho. Now, ev'n now he's coming! Just hov'ring o'er thee like a Bird of Prey. Thy Father vowsâfor I must tell thee Allâ 'Twas this that wrung my Heart, and rack'd my Brain Ev'n to Distraction!âVows thee to his Bed; Nay threaten'd Force, if thou refuse Obedience. Eud. Force?âthreaten'd Force?âmy Father!âwhere is Nature? Is that too banish'd from his Heart?âO then I have no FatherâHow have I deserv'd this?â[Weeping. No Home, but am henceforth an Out-cast Orphan; For I will wander to Earth's utmost Bounds, Ere give my Hand to that detested Contract. O save me, Phocyas! thou hast sav'd my Fatherâ Must I yet call him so, this cruel Father? How wilt thou now deliver poor Eudocia? Pho. See! how we're join'd in Exile, how our Fate Conspires to warn us both to leave this City! Thou know'st the Emperor is now at Antioch; I have an Unkle there, who, when the Persian, As now the Saracen, had nigh o'er-run The ravag'd Empire, did him signal Service, And nobly was rewarded. There, Eudocia, Thou might'st be safe, and I may meet with Justice. Eud. Thereâany where, so we may fly this Place. See, Phocyas, what thy Wrongs and mine have wrought In a weak Woman's Frame! for I have Courage To share thy Exile now thro' ev'ry Danger. Danger is only here, and dwells with Guilt, With base Ingratitude, and hard Oppression. Pho. Then let us lose no time, but hence this Night. The Gates I can command, and will provide The Means of our Escape. Some five Hours hence ('Twill then be turn'd of Midnight) we may meet In the Piazza of Honoria's Convent. Eud. I know it well; the Place is most secure, And near adjoyning to this Garden Wall. There thou shalt find meâO protect us, Heav'n! Pho. Fear not;âthy Innocence will be our Guard. I've thought already how to shape our Course. Some pitying Angel will attend thy Steps, Guide thee unseen, and charm the sleeping Foe, 'Till thou art safe!âO I have suffer'd nothing; Thus gaining thee, and this great generous Proof, How blest I am in my Eudocia's Love! My only Joy, Farewel!â Eud. Farewel, my Phocyas! I've now no Friend but theeâyet thee I'll call Friend, Father, Lover, Guardian!âThou art all. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE Caled's Tent. Caled attended. Sergius brought in, bound with Cords. Caled. Mercy? What's that?âLook yonder, on the Field Of our late Fight!âGo, talk of Mercy there. Will the Dead hear thy Voice? Serg. O spare me yet! Cal. Thou Wretch!âSpare thee?âto what? to live in Torture? Are not thy Limbs all bruis'd, thy Bones disjointed, To force thee to confess? And wou'dst thou dragg, Like a crush'd Serpent, a vile mangled Being? My Eyes abhor a CowardâHence, and dye! Serg. O, I have told thee all!âWhen first pursu'd, I fix'd my Letters on an Arrow's Point, And shot them o'er the Wallsâ Cal. Hast thou told all? Well, then thou shalt have Mercy to requite thee: Behold, I'll send thee forward on thy Errand. Strike off his Head; then cast it o'er the Gates; There let thy Tongue tell o'er its Tale again. Serg. O bloody Saracen!â [Ex. Sergius, dragg'd away by Guards. Enter Abudah. Cal. Abudah, welcome! Abu. O Caled! what an Evening was the last? Cal. Name it no more; Remembrance sickens with it. And therefore Sleep is banish'd from this Night, Nor shall To-morrow's Sun open his Eye Upon our Shame, e'er doubly we've redeem'd it. Have all the Captains Notice? Abu. I have walk'd The Rounds To-night, e'er the last Hour of Prayer, From Tent to Tent, and warn'd them to be ready. What must be done? Cal. Thou know'st th'important News, Which we have intercepted by this Slave, Of a new Army's March. The Time now calls, While these soft Syrians are dissolv'd in Riot, Fool'd with Success, and not suspecting Danger, Neglectful of their Watch, or else fast bound In Chains of Sleep, Companion of Debauches, To form a new Attack e'er break of Day. So, like the wounded Leopard, shall we rush From out our Covert on these drowsy Hunters, And seize 'em unprepar'd to 'scape our Vengeance. Abu. Great Captain of the Armies of the Faithful! I know thy mighty and unconquer'd Spirit. Yet hear me, Caled; hear, and weigh my Doubts. Our angry Prophet frowns upon our Vices, And visits us in Blood. Why else did Terrors Unknown before seize all our stoutest Bands? The Angel of Destruction was abroad; The Archers of the Tribe of Thoal fled, So long renown'd, or spent their Shafts in vain; The feather'd Flights err'd thro' the boundless Air, Or the Death turn'd on him that drew the Bow! What can this boad?âLet me speak plainer yet; Is it to propagate th'unspotted Law We fight? 'tis well; it is a noble Cause! But much I fear Infection is among us; A boundless Lust of Rapine guides our Troops. We learn the Christian Vices we chastise, And, tempted with the Pleasures of the Soil, More than with distant Hopes of Paradise, I fear, may soonâbut Oh! avert it Heav'n!â Fall ev'n a Prey to our own Spoils and Conquests. Cal. Noâthou mistak'st; thy pious Zeal deceives thee. Our Prophet only chides our sluggard Valour. Thou saw'st how in the Vale of Honan once The Troops, as now defeated, fled confus'd Ev'n to the Gates of Mecca's holy City; Till Mahomet himself there stop'd their Entrance, A Javelin in his Hand, and turn'd them back Upon the Foe; they fought again, and conquer'd. Behold how best we may appease his Wrath! His own Example points us out the Way. Abu. Wellâbe it then resolv'd. Th'indulgent Hour Of better Fortune is, I hope, at Hand. And yet, since Phocyas has appear'd its Champion, How has this City rais'd its drooping Head? As if some Charm prevail'd where-e'er he fought, Our Strength seems wither'd, and our feeble Weapons Forget their wonted Triumphâwere he absentâ Cal. I wou'd have sought him out in the last Action To single Fight, and put that Charm to Proof, Had not a foul and sudden Mist arose Ere I arriv'd to have restor'd the Combat. But let it beâ'tis past. We yet may meet, And 'twill be known whose Arm is then the stronger. Enter Daran. Dar. Health to the Race of Ismael! and Days More prosp'rous than the last;âa Christian Captive Is fall'n within my Watch, and waits his Doom. Cal. Bring forth the Slave!âO thou keen Vulture, Death! Do we then feed thee only thus by Morsels? Whole Armies never can suffice thy Hunger. Daran goes out, and re-enters with Phocyas. Cal. Whence, and what art thou?âof Damascus?âDaran, Where didst thou find this dumb and sullen Thing, That seems to lowr Defiance on our Anger? Dar. Marching in Circuit, with the Horse thou gavest me, T'observe the City Gates, I saw from far Two Persons issue forth; the one advanc'd, And ere he cou'd retreat, my Horsemen seiz'd him. The other was a Woman, and had fled, Upon a Signal giv'n at our Approach, And got within the Gate. Wou'dst thou know more, Himself, if he will speak, can best inform thee. Cal. Have I not seen thy Face? Abu. [to Caled.] He hears thee not; His Eyes are fix'd on Earth; some deep Distress Is at his Heart. This is no common Captive. Cal. A Lion in the Toils! We soon shall tame him. Still art thou dumb?âNay, 'tis in vain to cast Thy gloomy Looks so oft around this Place, Or frown upon thy Bondsâthou can'st not 'scape. Pho. Then be it soâthe worst is past already, And Life is now not worth a Moment's Pause. Do you not know me yet?âthink of the Man You have most Cause to curse, and I am He. Cal. Ha! Phocyas? Abu. Phocyas?âMahomet, we thank thee! Now thou dost smile again. Dar. [aside.] O Devil, Devil! And I not know him?â'twas but Yesterday He kill'd my Horse, and drove me from the Field. Now I'm reveng'd! No; hold you there, not yet, Not while he lives. Cal. [aside.] This is indeed a Prize!â Is it because thou know'st what slaughter'd Heaps There yet unbury'd lye without our Camp, Whose Ghosts have all this Night, passing the Zorat, Call'd from that Bridge of Death on thee to follow, That now thou'rt here to answer to their Cry? Howe'er it be, thou know'st thy Welcomeâ Pho. Yes, Thou proud, blood-thirsty Arab!âWell I know What to expect from thee; I know Ye all. How shou'd the Authors of Distress and Ruin Be mov'd to Pity? that's a Human Passion; Noâin your hungry Eyes, that look Revenge, I read my Doom. Where are your Racks, your Tortures? I'm readyâlead me to 'em; I can bear The worst of Ills from you. You're not my Friends, My Countrymen.âYet were ye Men, I cou'd Unfold a Storyâbut no moreâEumenes, Thou hast my Wish, and I am nowâa Worm! Abu. [to Caled aside.] Leader of Armies, hear him! for my Mind Presages Good accruing to our Cause By this Event. Cal. I tell thee then, thou wrong'st Us, To think our Hearts thus seal'd, or our Ears deaf To all that thou may'st utter. Speak, disclose That secret Woe that throbbs within thy Breast. Now, by the silent Hours of Night! we'll hear thee, And mute Attention shall await thy Words. Pho. This is not then the Palace in Damascus! If ye will hear, then I indeed have wrong'd you. How can this be?âWhen he for whom I've fought, Fought against you, has yet refus'd to hear me! You seem surpris'd.âIt was Ingratitude That drove me out from those abandon'd Walls, An Exile, not a Foe. Abu. Is't possible? Are these thy Christian Friends? Cal. 'Tis wellâwe thank 'em. They help us to subdue themselves.âBut who Was that Companion of thy Flight?âA Woman, So Daran saidâ Pho. 'Tis there I am most wretchedâ O I am torn from all my Soul held dear, And my Life's Blood flows out upon the Wound! That Womanâ'twas for herâHow shall I speak it?â Eudocia, O Farewel!âI'll tell you then, As fast as these Heart-rending Sighs will let me; I lov'd the Daughter of the proud Eumenes, And long in secret wooed her; not unwelcome To her my Visits; but I fear'd her Father, Who oft had press'd her to detested Nuptials, And therefore durst not till this Night of Joy Avow to him my Courtship. Now I thought her Mine, by a double Claim, of mutual Vows, And Service yielded at his greatest Need. When, as I mov'd my Suit, with sowr Disdain He mock'd my Service, and forbad my Love; Degraded me from the Command I bore, And with Defiance bade me seek the Foe. How has his Curse prevail'd!âThe generous Maid Was won by my Distress to leave the City; And cruel Fortune made me thus your Prey. Abu. [aside.] My Soul is mov'd.âThou wert a Man, O Prophet! Forgive, if 'tis a Crime, a human Sorrow For injur'd Merit, tho' 'tis in a Foe! Pho. Nowâsince you've have heard my Story, set me free, That I may save her yet, dearer than Life, From a tyrannick Father's threaten'd Force; Gold, Gemms, and Purple Vests shall pay my Ransome; Nor shall my peaceful Sword henceforth be drawn In Fight, nor break its Truce with you for ever. Cal. No;âthere's one Way, a betterâand but one, To save thy self, and make some Reparation For all the Numbers thy bold Hand has slain. Pho. O name it quickly, and my Soul will bless thee! Cal. Embrace our Faith, and share with us our Fortunes; Pho. Then I am lost again! Cal. What! When we offer Not Freedom only, but to raise thee high To Greatness, Conquest, Glory, Heav'nly Bliss! Pho. To sink me down to Infamy, Perdition, Here and hereafter! make my Name a Curse To present Times, to ev'ry future Age A Proverb and a Scorn!âtake back thy Mercy, And know I now disdain it. Cal. As thou wilt. The Time's too precious to be wasted longer In Words with thee. Thou know'st thy DoomâFarewel. Abu. [to Caled. Aside.] Hear me yet, Caled! grant him some short space; Perhaps at length he will accept thy Bounty. Try him at leastâ Cal. Wellâbe it so then. Daran, Guard well thy Charge.âThou hast an Hour to live; If thou art Wise, thou may'st prolong that Term; If notâwhyâFare thee well, and think of Death. [Exeunt Cal. and Abu. Phocyas. [Daran waiting at a Distance.] Farewell, and think of Death!âwas it not so? Do Murderers then preach Morality?â But how to think of what the Living know not, And the Dead cannot, or else may not tell?â What art thou, O thou great mysterious Terror! The Way to thee we know; Diseases, Famine, Sword, Fire, and all thy ever-open Gates That Day and Night stand ready to receive us. But what's beyond them?âWho will draw that Veil? Yet Death's not thereâNo; 'tis a Point of Time, The Verge 'twixt mortal and immortal Being. It mocks our Thought!âOn this Side All is Life; And when we've reach'd it, in that very Instant 'Tis past the thinking of!âO! if it be The Pangs, the Throes, the agonizing Struggle When Soul and Body part, sure I have felt it, And there's no more to fear. Daran. [Aside.] Suppose I now Dispatch him?âRightâWhat need to stay for Orders? I wish I durst!âYet what I dare I'll do. Your Jewels, ChristianâYou'll not need these Triflesâ [Searching him. Pho. I pr'ythee Slave stand offâMy Soul's too busy To lose a Thought on thee. Enter Abudah. Abu. What's this?âforbear! Who gave thee Leave to use this Insolence? [Takes the Jewels from him, and lays 'em on a Table. Dar. [Aside.] Deny'd my Booty?âCurses on his Head! Was not the Founder of our Law a Robber? Why, 'twas for that I left my Country's Gods, Menaph and Uzza. Better still be Pagan, Than starve with a new Faith. Abu. What?âDost thou mutter? Daran, withdraw; and better learn thy Duty. [Exit Daran. Phocyas, perhaps thou know'st me notâ Pho. I know Thy Name Abudah, and thy Office here The second in Command. What more thou art Indeed I cannot tell. Abu. True; for thou yet Know'st not I am thy Friend. Pho. Is't possible?â Thou speak'st me fair. Abu. What dost thou think of Life? Pho. I think not of it; Death was in my Thoughts. On hard Conditions, Life were but a Load, And I wou'd lay it down. Abu. Art thou resolv'd? Pho. I am, unless thou bring'st me better Terms Than those I have rejected. Abu. Think again. Caled, by me, once more, renews that Offer. Pho. Thou say'st thou art my Friend; why dost thou try To shake the settled Temper of my Breast? My Soul had just discharg'd her cumbrous Train Of Hopes and Fears, prepar'd to take her Voyage To other Seats, where She may rest in Peace; And now thou call'st me back, to beat again The painful Roads of Life.âTempt me no more To be a Wretch, for I despise the Offer. Abu. The General knows thee brave, and 'tis for that He seeks Alliance with thy noble Virtues. Pho. He knows me brave?âwhy does he then thus treat me? No; He believes I am so poor of Soul, That barely for the Privilege to live, I wou'd be bought his Slave. But go, and tell him, The little Space of Life his Scorn bequeath'd me Was lent in vain, and he may take the Forfeit. Abu. Why wilt thou wed thy self to Misery, When our Faith courts thee to eternal Blessings? When Truth it self is, like a Seraph, come To loose thy Bonds?âThe Light Divine, whose Beams Pierc'd thro' the Gloom of Hera's sacred Cave, And there illumin'd the great Mahomet, Arabia's Morning-Star, now shines on thee. Arise, salute with Joy the Guest from Heav'n, Follow her Steps, and be no more a Captive. Pho. But whither must I follow?âanswer that. Is She a Guest from Heav'n? What Marks Divine, What Signs, what Wonders vouch her boasted Mission? Abu. What Wonders?âturn thy Eyes to Mecca! mark How from Caaba first, that hallow'd Temple, Her Glory dawn'd!âthen look, how swift its Course, As when the Sun-beams shooting thro' a Cloud Drive o'er the Meadow's Face the flying Shades! Have not the Nations bent before our Swords, Like ripen'd Corn before the Reaper's Steel? Why is all this? Why does Success still wait Upon our Law, if not to shew that Heav'n First sent it forth, and owns it still by Conquest? Pho. Dost thou ask why is this?âO why indeed? Where is the Man can read Heav'n's secret Councils?â Why did I conquer in another Cause, Yet now am here?â Abu. I'll tell theeâthy good Angel Has seiz'd thy Hand unseen, and snatch'd thee out From swift Destruction; know, e'er Day shall dawn Damascus will in Blood lament its Fall; We've heard what Army is design'd to march Too late to save her. Now, ev'n now, our Force Is just preparing for a fresh Assault. Now too thou might'st revenge thy Wrongsâso Caled Charg'd me to say; and more, that he invites thee, Thou know'st the Termsâto share with him the Conquest. Pho. Conquest?âRevenge?âHold, let me thinkâO Horror! Revenge?âO what Revenge?âBleed on, my Wounds; For thus to be reveng'd, were it not worse Than all that I can suffer?âBut Eudocia!â Where will she thenâShield her, ye pitying Pow'rs, And let me dye in Peace! Abu. Hear me once more, 'Tis all I have to offer;âmark me now! Caled has sworn Eudocia shall be safe. Pho. Ha! Safe?âbut how? a wretched Captive too! Abu. He swears she shall be free, she shall be thine. Pho. Then I am lost indeedâO cruel Bounty! How can I be at once both curst and happy? Abu. The Time draws near, and I must quickly leave thee; But first reflect, that in this fatal Night Slaughter and Rapine may be loos'd abroad, And while they roam with undistinguish'd Rage, Shou'd She thou lov'stâwell may'st thou startâbe made, Perhaps unknown, some barb'rous Soldier's Prey, Shou'd She then fall a Sacrifice to Lust Or brutal Furyâ Pho. Oâthis pulls my Heart-strings! [falls. Earth, openâsave me, save me from that Thought, There's Ruin in it; 'twill, it will undo me. Abu. Nay, do not plunge thy self in black Despair; Look up, poor Wretch, thou art not shipwreck'd yet, Behold an Anchor; am not I thy Friend? Yet hear me, and be blestâ Pho. [rising] Hah! who, what art thou? [raving. My Friend? that's well; but holdâare all Friends honest? What's to be done?âHush, Hark! what Voice is that! Abu. There is no Voice; 'tis yet the Dead of Night, The Guards without keep silent Watch around us. Pho. Againâit callsâ'tis SheâO lead me to herâ Abu. Thy Passion mocks thee with imagin'd Sounds. Pho. Sure 'twas Eudocia's Voice cry'd outâForbear. What shall I do?âO Heav'n! Abu. Heav'n shews thee what. Nay, now it is too late; see, Caled comes With Anger on his Brow; quickly withdraw To the next Tent, and thereâ Pho. [Raving.] What do I see? Damascus! Conquest! Ruin! Rapes and Murder! Villains!âIs there no wayâO save her, save her! [Exit with Abudah. Enter Caled and Daran. Dar. Behold, on thy Approach they shift their Ground. Cal. 'Tis as thou say'st, he trifles with my Mercy. Dar. Speak, shall I fetch his Head? Cal. No, stay thou here, I cannot spare thee yet. Raphan, go thou. [To an Officer. But holdâI've thought againâhe shall not dye. Go, tell him he shall live, till he has seen Damascus sink in Flame, till he behold That Slave, the Woman-Idol he adores, Or giv'n a Prize to some brave Mussulman, Or slain before his Face; then, if he sue For Death, as for a Boonâperhaps we'll grant it. [Ex. Raphan. Dar. The Captains wait thy Orders. Cal. Are the Troops Ready to march? Dar. They are. [The Captains pass by as they are nam'd. Cal. Where's Abu-Taleb? Alcorash?âO, your valiant Tribes, I thank 'em, Fled from their Standard! Will they now redeem it? Omar and Serjabil?â'tis well, I see 'em. You know your Duty. You, Abdorraman, Must charge with Raphan. Mourn, thou haughty City! The Bow is bent, nor can'st thou 'scape thy Doom. Who turns his Back henceforth, our Prophet curse him! Dar. But who commands the trusty Bands of Mecca? Thou know'st their Leader fell in the last Fight. Cal. 'Tis true; thou, Daran, well deserv'st that Charge, I've mark'd what a keen Hatred, like my own, Dwells in thy Breast against these Christian Dogs. Dar. Thou dost me Right. Cal. And therefore I'll reward it. Be that Command now thine. And hereâthis Sabre, Bless'd in the Field by Mahomet himself At Caaba's prosp'rous Fight, shall aid thy Arm. Dar. Thanks, my good Chief; with this I'll better thank thee. [Taking the Scimitar. Cal. My self will lead the Troops of the black Standard, And at the Eastern Gate begin the Storm. Dar. But why do we not move? 'twill soon be Day. Methinks I'm cold, and wou'd grow warm with Action. Cal. Then haste and tell AbudahâO thou'rt welcome, Enter Abudah. Thy Charge awaits thee. Where's the stubborn Captive? Abu. Indeed he's brave. I left him for a Moment In the next Tent. He's scarcely yet himself. Cal. But is he ours? Abu. The Threats of Death are nothing; Tho' thy last Message shook his Soul, as Winds On the bleak Hills bend down some lofty Pine; Yet still he held his Root; till I found Means, Abating somewhat of thy first Demand, If not to make him wholly ours, at least To gain sufficient to our End. Cal. Say how? Abu. Oft he inclin'd, oft started back; at last, When just consenting, for awhile he paus'd, Stood fix'd in Thought, and lift his Eyes to Heav'n; Then, as with fresh recover'd Force, cry'd out Renounce my Faith? NeverâI answer'd, No, That now he shou'd not do it. Cal. How? Abu. Yet hear. For since I saw him now so lost in Passion, That must be left to his more temperate Thoughts. Mean time I urg'd, conjur'd, at last constrain'd him By all he held most dear, nay by the Voice Of Providence, that call'd him now to save, With her he lov'd, perhaps the Lives of thousands, No longer to resist his better Fate, But join his Arms in present Action with us, And swear he wou'd be faithful. Cal. What, no more? Then he's a Christian still? Abu. Have Patience yet, For if by him we can surprize the Cityâ Cal. Say'st thou? Abu. Hear what's agreed, but on the Terms That ev'ry unresisting Life be spar'd. I shall command some chosen faithful Bands, Phocyas will guide us to the Gate, from whence He late escap'd, nor do we doubt but there With Ease to gain Admittance. Cal. This is something. And yet I do not like this Half-Allyâ Is he not still a Christian?âbut no matterâ Mean time I will attack the Eastern Gate; Who first succeeds gives Entrance to the rest. Hear, All! Prepare ye now for boldest Deeds, And know the Prophet will reward your Valour. Think that ye All to certain Triumph move; Who falls in Fight yet meets the Prize above. There, in the Gardens of eternal Spring, While Birds of Paradise around you sing, Each, with his blooming Beauty by his Side, Shall drink rich Wines that in full Rivers glide, Breathe fragrant Gales o'er Fields of Spice that blow, And gather Fruits immortal as they grow. Ecstatick Bliss shall your whole Powers employ, And every Sense be lost in every Joy. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE A great Square in the City, before the Governor's Palace. Enter Abudah, Saracen Captains and Soldiers; with Eumenes, Herbis, and others of the Christians unarm'd. Eumenes. It must be soâFarewel, devoted Walls!â To be surpris'd thus?âHell and all ye Fiends, How did ye watch this Minute for Destruction? Herb. We've been betray'd by Riot and Debauch; Curse on the Traytor-Guard! Eum. The Guard above, Did that sleep too? Abu. Christians, complain no more. What you have ask'd is granted. Are ye Men, And dare ye question thus, with bold Impatience, Eternal Justice!âKnow, the Doom from Heav'n Falls on your Towers, resistless as the Bolt That fires the Cedars on your Mountain Tops. Be meek, and learn with humble Awe to bear The mitigated Ruin. Worse had follow'd, Had ye oppos'd our Numbers. Quarter and Liberty are giv'n to All; And little do ye think how much ye owe To one brave Enemy, whom yet ye know not. Enter Artamon hastily. Art. All's lost!âHa!âWho are these? Eum. All's lost indeed. Yield up thy Sword, if thou wou'dst share our Safety. Thou com'st too late to bring us News. Art. Oâno. The News I bring is from the Eastern Guard. Caled has forc'd the Gate, andâbut He's here. A Cry without.] Fly, fly; they follow.âQuarter, Mercy, Quarter! [Several Persons as pursu'd run over the Stage. Caled [without.] No Quarter! Kill, I say; are they not Christians! More Blood! our Prophet asks it.â He enters with Daran, &amp;c. What, Abudah? Well met!âbut wherefore are these Looks of Peace? Why sleeps thy Sword? Abu. Caled, our Task is over. Behold the Chiefs; they have resign'd the Palace. Cal. And sworn t'obey our Law? Abu. No. Cal. Then fall on. Abu. Hold yet, and hear meâHeav'n by me has spar'd The Sword its cruel Task. On easy Terms We've gain'd a bloodless Conquest. Cal. I renounce it. Curse on those Terms; the City's mine by Storm. Fall on, I sayâ Abu. Nay then, I swear Ye shall not. Cal. Ha!âWho am I? Abu. The General, and I know What Reverence is your Due [Cal. signs to his Men to fall on. âNay, he who stirs First makes his Way thro' me. My Honour's pledg'd; Rob me of that who dares. [they stop.] I know thee, Caled, Chief in Command; bold, valiant, wise and faithful. But yet remember I'm a Mussulman, Nay more, thou know'st, Companion of the Prophet, And what we vow is sacred. Cal. Thou'rt a Christian, I swear thou art, and hast betray'd the Faith. Curse on thy new Allies! Abu. No moreâthis Strife But ill beseems the Servants of the Caliph, And casts ReproachâChristians, withdraw a while: I pledge my Life to answer the Conditionsâ [Ex. Eum. Herb. &amp;c. Why, Caled, do we thus expose ourselves A Scorn to Nations that despise our Law? Thou call'st me ChristianâWhat? Is it because I prize my plighted Faith, that I'm a Christian? Come, 'tis not well, and ifâ Cal. What Terms are yielded? Abu. Leave to depart, to all that will; an Oath First giv'n, no more to aid the War against us. An unmolested March. Each Citizen To take his Goods, not more than a Mule's Burden; The Chiefs six Mules, and ten the Governor. Besides some few slight Arms for their Defence Against the Mountain Robbers. Cal. Now, by Mahomet, Thou hast equipp'd an Army. Abu. Canst thou doubt The greater Part by far will chuse to stay, Receive our Law, or pay th'accustom'd Tribute? What fear we then from a few wretched Bands Of scatter'd Fugitives?âbesides, thou know'st What Towns of Strength remain yet unsubdu'd. Let us appear this once like generous Victors, So future Conquests shall repay this Bounty, And willing Provinces ev'n court Subjection. Cal. Wellâbe it on thy Head, if worse befall! This once I yieldâbut see it then proclaim'd Thro' all Damascus, that who will depart Must leave the Place this Instant.âPass, move on. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Outside of a Nunnery. Eudocia. Darkness is fled; and yet the Morning Light Gives me more Fears than did Night's deadly Gloom. Within, Without, All, all are Foes.âO Phocyas, Thou art perhaps at Rest; wou'd I were too! [After a Pause. This Place has holy Charms; Rapine and Murder Dare not approach it, but are aw'd to Distance. I've heard that ev'n these Infidels have spar'd Walls sacred to Devotion.âWorld, Farewel! Here will I hide me, 'till the friendly Grave Open its Arms, and shelter me for ever. [Exit. Enter Phocyas. Pho. Did I not hear the Murmurs of a Voice, This Way?âa Woman's too?âand seem'd complaining? Hark!âNoâO Torture! Whither shall I turn me? I've search'd the Palace Rooms in vain, and now, I know not why, some Instinct brought me hither.â 'Twas here last Night we met. Dear, dear Eudocia! Might I once moreâ [Going out, he meets her entring. Eudo. Who calls the lost Eudocia? Sure 'tis a friendly Voice. Pho. 'Tis She!âO Rapture! Eud. Is't possible?âmy Phocyas?â Pho. My Eudocia! Do I yet call thee mine? Eud. Do I yet see thee? Yet hear thee speak?âO how hast thou escap'd From barbarous Swords, and Men that know not Mercy? Pho. I've borne a thousand Deaths since our last Parting. But wherefore do I talk of Death?âfor now Methinks, I'm rais'd almost to Life immortal, And feel I'm blest beyond the Pow'r of Change. Eud. O yet bewareâlest some Event unknown Again shou'd part Us. Pho. [Aside.] Heav'n avert the Omen! None can, my Fair, none shall. Eud. Alas! thy Transport Makes thee forget; is not the City taken? Pho. It is. Eud. And are we not beset with Foes? Pho. There are no Foesâor none to theeâNo Danger. Eud. No Foes? Pho. I know not how to tell thee yetâ But think, Eudocia, that my matchless Love And wondrous Causes prÃ¦ordain'd, conspiring, For thee have triumph'd o'er the fiercest Foes, And turn'd 'em into Friends. Eud. Amazement! Friends?â O all ye Guardian Powers!âSay onâO lead me, Lead me thro' this dark Maze of Providence Which thou hast trod, that I may trace thy Steps With silent Awe, and worship as I pass. Pho. Enquire no moreâthou shalt know all hereafterâ Let me conduct thee henceâ Eud. O whither next? To what far distant Home?âBut 'tis enough, That favour'd thus of Heav'n thou art my Guide. And as we journey on the painful Way Say, wilt thou then beguile the passing Hours And open all the Wonders of thy Story? Pho. Indulge no more thy melancholy Thoughts, Damascus is thy Home. Eud. And yet thou say'st It is no longer Ours!âWhere is my Father? Pho. To shew thee how too Fate seems every Way To guard thy Safety, ev'n thy Father now, Wert thou within his Pow'r, wou'd stand defeated Of his tyrannick Vow. Thou know'st last Night What Hope of Aids flatter'd this foolish City; At Break of Day th'Arabian Scouts had seiz'd A second Courier, and from him 'tis learn'd That on their March the Army mutiny'd, And Eutyches was slain. Eud. And yet, That, now Is of the least Importance to my Peace. But answer me; say, where is now my Father? Pho. Or gone, or just preparing to depart. Eud. What! Is our Doom revers'd? And is he then The wretched Fugitive?â Pho. Thou heav'nly Maid! To free thee then from ev'ry anxious Thought, Know, I've once more, wrong'd as I am, ev'n sav'd Thy Father's threaten'd Life, nay sav'd Damascus From Blood and Slaughter, and from total Ruin. Terms are obtain'd, and general Freedom granted To all that will, to leave in Peace the City. Eud. Is't possibleânow trust me I cou'd chide thee. 'Tis much unkind to hold me thus in Doubt; I pr'ythee clear these Wonders. Pho. 'Twill surprise thee, When thou shalt knowâ Eud. What? Pho. To what deadly Gulphs Of Horror and Despair, what cruel Straits Of agonizing Thought I have been driv'n This Night, e'er my perplex'd bewilder'd Soul Cou'd find its Wayâthou said'st that thou woud'st chide; I fear thou wilt; indeed I have done that I cou'd have wish'd t'avoidâbut for a Cause So lovely, so belov'dâ Eud. What dost thou mean? I'll not indulge a Thought that thou cou'dst do One Act unworthy of thy self, thy Honour, And that firm Zeal against these Foes of Heav'n Which won my Heart at first to share in all Thy Dangers and thy Fame, and wish thee mine. Thou cou'dst not save thy Life by Means inglorious. Pho. Alas! thou know'st me notâI'm Man, frail Man, To Error born; and who that's Man is perfect? To save my Life? O no; well was it risqu'd For thee! had it been lost, 'twere not too much, And thou but safe;âO what wou'dst thou have said, If I had risqu'd my Soul to save Eudocia? Eud. Ha! SpeakâO no, be dumbâit cannot be! And yet thy Looks are chang'd, thy Lips grow pale. Why dost thou shake?âalas! I tremble too! Thou cou'dst not, hast not sworn to Mahomet? Pho. NoâI shou'd first have dy'dânay giv'n up thee. Eud. O Phocyas! Was it well to try me thus?â And yet another deadly Fear succeeds. How came these Wretches hither? Who reviv'd Their fainting Arms to unexpected Triumph? For while thou fought'st, and fought'st the Christian Cause, These batter'd Walls were Rocks impregnable, Their Tow'rs of Adamant. But O I fear Some Act of thineâ Pho. No moreâI'll tell thee all; But pr'ythee do not frown on me, Eudocia!â I found the wakeful Foe in Midnight Council Resolv'd, e'er Day, to make a fresh Attack, Keen for Revenge, and hungry after Slaughter. Cou'd my rack'd Soul bear that, and think of thee? Nay think of thee expos'd a helpless Prey To some fierce Ruffian's violating Arms? O had the World been mine, in that Extreme I shou'd have giv'n whole Provinces away, Nay allâand thought it little for thy Ransom! Eud. For this thenâohâthou hast betray'd the City! Distrustful in the Righteous Pow'rs above, That still protect the Chaste and Innocent; And to avert a feign'd uncertain Danger, Thou hast brought certain Ruin on thy Country! Pho. No, thou forget'st the friendly Termsâthe Sword, Which threaten'd to have fill'd these Streets with Blood, Is sheath'd in Peace; thy Father, thou, and all The Citizens are safe, uncaptiv'd, free. Eud. Safe? free? O no!âLife, Freedom, every Good Turns to a Curse, if sought by wicked Means. Yet sure it cannot be!âAre these the Terms On which we meet?âNoâwe can never meet On Terms like these; the Hand of Death it self Cou'd not have torn us from each others Arms Like this dire Act, this more than fatal Blow! In Death, the Soul and Body only part To meet again, and be divorc'd no more; But nowâ Pho. Ha! Lightning blast me! Strike me, Ye vengeful Bolts! if this is my Reward! Are these my hop'd-for Joys? Is this the Welcome The wretched Phocyas meets, from her he lov'd More than Life, Fameâev'n to his Soul's Distraction? Eud. Had'st thou not help'd the Slaves of Mahomet, To spread their impious Conquests o'er thy Country, What Welcome was there in Eudocia's Power She had with-held from Phocyas? but alas! 'Tis thou hast blasted all our Joys for ever, And cut down Hope like a poor short-liv'd Flower, Never to grow again! Pho. Cruel Eudocia! If in my Heart's deep Anguish I've been forc'd Awhile from what I wasâdost thou reject me? Think of the Causeâ Eud. The Cause? there is no Cause! Not universal Nature cou'd afford A Cause for this; what were Dominion, Pomp, The Wealth of Nations, nay of all the World, The World it self, or what a thousand Worlds, If weigh'd with Faith unspotted, heav'nly Truth, Thoughts free from Guilt, the Empire of the Mind, And all the Triumphs of a God-like Breast Firm and unmov'd in the great Cause of Virtue? Pho. How shall I answer thee?âmy Soul is aw'd, And trembling owns th'eternal Force of Reason! But oh! can nothing then attone, or plead For Pity from thee? Eud. Can'st thou yet undo The Deed that's done, recall the Time that's past? O call back Yesterday, call back last Night, Tho' with its Fears, its Dangers, its Distress; Bid the fair Hours of Innocence return, When, in the lowest Ebb of changeful Fortune, Thou wer't more glorious in Eudocia's Eyes Than all the Pride of Monarchs!âbut that Deedâ Pho. No moreâthou waken'st in my tortur'd Heart The cruel conscious Worm that stings to Madness. O I'm undone!âI know it, and can bear To be undone for thee, but not to lose thee. Eud. Poor Wretch!âI pity thee!âbut art thou Phocyas? The Man I lov'd?âI cou'd have dy'd with thee E'er thou did'st this; then we had gone together, A glorious Pair, and soar'd above the Stars, Bright as the Stars themselves; and as we pass'd The heav'nly Roads, and Milky Ways of Light, Had heard the blest Inhabitants with Wonder Applaud our spotless Love. But never, never Can I be made the curst Reward of Treason, To seal thy Doom, to bind a hellish League, And to ensure thy everlasting Woe. Pho. What League?â'tis endedâI renounce itâthus [Kneels. I bend to Heav'n and thee.âO thou Divine, Thou matchless Image of all perfect Goodness! Do thou but pity yet the wretched Phocyas, Heav'n will relent, and all may yet be well. Eud. NoâWe must part. 'Twill ask whole Years of Sorrow To purge away this Guilt. Then do not think Thy Loss in me is worth one dropping Tear; But, if thou wou'dst be reconcil'd to Heav'n, First sacrifice to Heav'n that fatal Passion That caus'd thy FallâFarewel: forget the lostâ But how shall I ask that?âI wou'd have said, For thy Soul's Peace, forget the lost Eudocia: Canst thou forget her?âO the killing Torture To think 'twas Love, Excess of Love, divorc'd Us! Farewel forâstill I cannot speak that Word, These Tears speak for meâO Farewelâ [Exit. Pho. [Raving] For ever! Return, return and speak it, say for ever!â She's goneâand now she joins the Fugitives. And yet, she did not quite pronounce my Doomâ O hear, all-gracious Heav'n! wilt thou at once Forgive, and O inspire me to some Act This Day, that may in part redeem what's past! Prosper this Day, or let it be my last. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE an open Place in the City. Enter Caled and Daran meeting. Caled. Soldier, what News? thou look'st as thou wer't angry. Dar. And, durst I say it, so, my Chief, I am. I've spokeâif it offends, my Head is thine, Take it, and I am silent. Cal. No; say on. I know thee honest, and perhaps I guess What knits thy Brow in Frownsâ Dar. Is this, my Leader, A conquer'd City!âView yon Vale of Palms; Behold the vanquish'd Christian triumphs still, Rich in his Flight, and mocks thy barren War. Cal. The Vale of Palms! Dar. Beyond those Hills, the Place Where they agreed this Day to meet and halt, To gather all their Forces: there, disguis'd, Just now I've view'd their CampâO I cou'd curse My Eyes for what they've seen. Cal. What hast thou seen? Dar. Why, all Damascus; all its Soul, its Life, Its Heart's-Blood, all its Treasure, Piles of Plate, Crosses enrich'd with Gems, Arras and Silks, And Vests of Gold, unfolded to the Sun, That rival all his Lustre. Cal. How! Dar. 'Tis true. The Bees are wisely bearing off their Honey, And soon the empty Hive will be our own. Cal. So forward too? Curse on this foolish Treaty. Dar. Forwardâit looks as they had been forewarn'd. By Mahomet, the Land wears not the Face Of War, but Trade; and thou wou'dst swear its Merchants Were sending forth their loaded Caravans To all the Neighbouring Countries. Cal. [Aside.] Ha! this starts A lucky Thought of Mahomet's first Exploit, When he pursu'd the Caravan of Corash, And from a thousand mis-believing Slaves Wrested their ill-heap'd Goods, transferr'd to thrive In holier Hands, and propagate the Faith.â [To Daran] 'Tis said, the Emperor had a Wardrobe here Of costly Silks. Dar. That too they have remov'd. Cal. Dogs! Infidels! 'tis more than was allow'd. Dar. And shall we not pursue 'emâRobbers! Thieves! That steal away themselves, and all they're worth, And wrong the valiant Soldier of his Due. Cal. [aside.] The Caliph shall know thisâhe shall, Abudah. This is thy Coward BargainâI renounce it. Daran, we'll stop their March, and make a Search. Dar. And strip? Cal. And kill. Dar. That's well. And yet I fear Abudah's Christian Friendâ Cal. If possible, He shou'd not know of this; no, nor Abudah. By the seven Heav'ns! his Soul's a Christian too, And 'tis by Kindred Instinct he thus saves Their cursed Lives, and taints our Cause with Mercy. Dar. I knew my General wou'd not suffer this, Therefore I've Troops prepar'd without the Gate; Just mounted for Pursuit. Our Arab Horse Will in few Minutes reach the Place; yet still I must repeat my Doubtsâthat Devil Phocyas Will know it soonâI met him near the Gate, My Nature sickens at him, and forebodes I know not what of Ill. Cal. No more: away With thy cold Fearsâwe'll march this very Instant, And quickly make this thriftless Conquest good: The Sword too has been wrong'd, and thirsts for Blood. SCENE II. A Valley full of Tents; Baggage and Harness lying up and down amongst them. The Prospect terminated with Palm-Trees and Hills at a Distance. Eumenes, with Officers, Attendants, and Crouds of the People of Damascus. Eum. [Entring.] Sleep onâand Angels be thy Guard!âsoft Slumber Has gently stole her from her Griefs awhile. Let none approach the Tent.âAre Out-guards plac'd On yonder Hills? [To an Officer. 1 Off. They are Eum. [striking his Breast.] Damascus! Oâ Still art thou here?âLet me entreat you, Friends, To keep strict Order; I have no Command, And can but now advise you. 1 Cit. You are still Our Head and Leader. 2 Cit. We resolve t'obey you. 3 Cit. We're all prepar'd to follow you. Eum. I thank you. The Sun will soon go down upon our Sorrows, And 'till to-morrow's Dawn this is our Home: Mean while, each, as he can, forget his Loss, And bear the present Lot.â Officer. Sir, I have mark'd The Camp's Extent; 'tis stretch'd quite thro' the Valley. I think that more than half the City's here. Eum. The Prospect gives me much Relief. I'm pleas'd, My honest Countrymen, t'observe your Numbers; And yet it fills my Eyes with Tears.â'Tis said The mighty Persian wept, when he survey'd His numerous Army, but to think 'em Mortal; Yet he then flourish'd in Prosperity. Alas! What's that?âProsperity? a Harlot That smiles but to betray! O shining Ruin! Thou Nurse of Passions, and thou Bane of Virtue! O self-destroying Monster! that art blind, Yet putt'st out Reason's Eyes, that still shou'd guide thee, Then plungest down some Precipice unseen, And art no more!âHear me, all-gracious Heav'n! Let me wear out my small Remains of Life Obscure, content with humble Poverty, Or in Affliction's hard but wholsome School, If it must be.âI'll learn to know my self, And that's more worth than Empire. But, O Heav'n, Curse me no more with proud Prosperity! It has undone me!âHerbis; where, my Friend, Hast thou been this long Hour? Enter Herbis. Herb. On yonder Summit, To take a farewel Prospect of Damascus. Eum. And is it worth a Look? Herb. NoâI've forgot it. All our Possessions are a Grasp of Air; We're cheated whilst we think we hold them fast, And when they're gone, we know that they were nothing. But I've a deeper Wound. Eum. Poor good old Man! 'Tis true; thy Sonâthere thou'rt indeed unhappy. Enter Artamon. What, Artamon?âart thou here too? Art. Yes, Sir. I never boasted much of my Religion, Yet I've some Honour, and a Soldier's Pride; I like not these new Lords. Eum. Thou'rt brave and honest. Nay, we'll not despair. A Time may come When from these brute Barbarians we may wrest Once more our pleasant Seats.âAlas! how soon The Flatterer Hope is ready with his Song To charm us to Forgetfulness!âNo moreâ Let that be left to Heav'n!âSee, Herbis, see, Methinks we've here a goodly City yet! Was it not thus our great Forefathers liv'd, In better times?âin humble Fields and Tents, With all their Flocks and Herds, their moving Wealth! See too! where our own Pharphar winds his Stream Thro' the long Vale, as if to follow us, And kindly offers his cool wholsome Draughts To ease us in our March! Why this is Plenty. Enter Eudocia. Eum. My Daughter?âwherefore hast thou left thy Tent? What breaks so soon thy Rest? Eud. Rest is not there, Or I have sought in vain, and cannot find it. Oh noâwe're Wanderers, it is our Doom, There is no Rest for us. Eum. Thou art not well. Eud. I wou'd, if possible, avoid my self. I'm better now, near you. Eum. Near me?âalas! The tender Vine so wreaths its folded Arms Around some falling Elm!âIt wounds my Heart To think thou follow'st but to share my Ruin. I have lost all but thee. Eud. O say not so. You have lost nothing; Noâyou have preserv'd Immortal Wealth, your Faith inviolate To Heav'n and to your Country. Have you not Refus'd to joyn with prosp'rous wicked Men, And hold from them a false inglorious Greatness? Ruin is yonder, in Damascus, now The Seat abhorr'd of cursed Infidels. Infernal Error, like a Plague, has spread Contagion thro' its guilty Palaces, And we are fled from Death. Eum. Heroick Maid! Thy Words are Balsam to my Griefs. Eudocia, I never knew thee till this Day; I knew not How many Virtues I had wrong'd in thee. Eud. If you talk thus, you have not yet forgiv'n me. Eum. Forgiv'n thee?âwhy, for thee it is, thee only, I think Heav'n yet may look with Pity on us; Yes, we must all forgive each other now. Poor Herbis tooâwe both have been to blame. O Phocyasâbut it cannot be recall'd. Yet were He here, we'd ask him Pardon too. My Child!âI meant not to provoke thy Tears. Eud. [Aside.] O why is he not here? Why do I see Thousands of happy Wretches, that but seem Undone, yet still are blest in Innocence, And why was he not One? Enter an Officer. 1 Off. Where is Eumenes? Eum. What means thy breathless Haste? 1 Off. I fear there's Danger. For as I kept my Watch, I spy'd afar Thick Clouds of Dust, and on a nearer View Perceiv'd a Body of Arabian Horse Moving this way. I saw them wind the Hill, And then lost Sight of 'em. Herb. I saw 'em too, Where the Roads meet on t'other side these Hills, But took them for some Bands of Christian Arabs Crossing the Country.âThis way did they move? 1 Off. With utmost Speed. Eum. If they are Christian Arabs, They come as Friends; if other, we're secure By the late Terms. Retire awhile, Eudocia, Till I return. [Exit Eudocia. I'll to the Guard my self. Soldier, lead on the way. Enter another Officer. 2 Off. Arm, Arm! we're ruin'd! The Foe is in the Camp. Eum. So soon? 2 Off. They've quitted Their Horses, and with Sword in Hand have forc'd Our Guard; they say they come for Plunder. Eum. Villains! Sure Caled knows not of this Treachery. Come onâwe can fight still. We'll make 'em know What 'tis to urge the Wretched to Despair. [Exeunt. [A noise of Fighting is heard for some time. Enter Daran, with a Party of Saracen Soldiers. Dar. Let the Fools fight at Distance.âHere's the Harvest; Reap, reap, my Countrymen!âAy, thereâfirst clear Those further Tentsâ [Exeunt Soldiers bearing off Baggage, &amp;c. Looking between the Tents.] What's here, a Woman?âFair She seems, and well attir'd!âIt shall be so, I'll strip her first, and thenâ [Exit, and returns with Eudocia. Eud. [struggling.] Mercy! O spare me! Help, save me!âWhat, no Help?âBarbarian! Monster! Heav'n hear my Cries. Dar. Woman, thy Cries are vain. No Help is near. Enter Phocyas. Pho. Villain, thou lyest! take that To loose thy Holdâ [Pushing him with his Spear. Dar. What, thou? my evil Spirit! Is't thou that haunt'st me still?âbut, thus I thank thee. [Offering to strike with his Scimeter. It will not beâLightning for ever blast This Coward Arm that fails me!âO vile Syrian, [Falls. I'm kill'dâO Curseâ [Dies. Pho. Die then; thy Curses choak thee!â Eudocia! Eud. Phocyas!âO Astonishment! Then is it thus that Heav'n has heard my Pray'rs? I tremble stillâand scarce have Power to ask thee How thou art here? or whence this sudden Outrage? Pho. [walking aside.] The Blood ebbs back that fill'd my Heart, and now Again her parting Farewel awes my Soul, As if 'twere Fate, and not to be revok'd. Will she not now upbraid me, See thy Friends! Are these, are these the Villains thou hast trusted? Eud. What means this murmur'd Sorrow to thy self? Is it in vain that thou hast rescu'd me From Savage Hands?âSay, what's th'approaching Danger? Pho. Sure every Angel watches o'er thy Safety! Thou see'st 'tis Death t'approach thee without Awe, And Barbarism it self cannot profane thee. Eud. Thou dost not answer, whence are these Alarms? Pho. Some Stores remov'd, and not allow'd by Treaty, Have drawn the Saracens to make a Search. Perhaps 'twill quickly be agreedâBut Oh! Thou know'st, Eudocia, I'm a banish'd Man, And 'tis a Crime I'm here once more before thee; Else, might I speak, 'twere better for the present If thou wou'dst leave this Place. Eud. NoâI've a Father, (And can I leave him now?) whom we have wrong'd, Or he had not been thus driv'n out, expos'd The humble Tenant of this shelt'ring Vale For one poor Night's Repose.âAnd yet, alas! For this last Act how wou'd I thank thee, Phocyas?â I've nothing now but Pray'rs and Tears to give, Cold fruitless Thanks.âBut 'tis some Comfort yet That Fate allows this short Reprieve, that thus We may behold each other, and once more May mourn our Woes, e'er yet we partâ Pho. For ever!â 'Tis then resolv'dâit was thy cruel Sentence, And I am here to execute that Doom. Eud. What dost thou mean? Pho. kneeling] Thus, at thy Feetâ Eud. O rise! Pho. NeverâNo, here I'll lay my Burden down; I've try'd its Weight, nor can support it longer. Take thy last Look; if yet thy Eyes can bear To look upon a Wretch accurst, cast off By Heav'n and theeâA little longer yet And I am mingled with my Kindred Dust, By thee forgotten and the Worldâ Eud. Forbear! O cruel Man! Why wilt thou rack me thus? Didst thou not mark, thou didst, when last we parted, The Pangs, the Strugglings of my suff'ring Soul? That nothing but the Hand of Heav'n it self Cou'd e'er divide me from thee?âDost thou now Reproach me thus? Or can'st thou have a Thought That I can e'er forget thee? Pho. [rising.] Have a Care! I'll not be tortur'd more with thy false Pity. No, I renounce it. See, I am prepar'd. [Shewing a Dagger. Thy Cruelty is Mercy nowâFarewel. And Death is now but a Release from Torment. Eud. HoldâStay thee yet!âO Madness of Despair! And wou'dst thou die? Think, e'er thou leap the Gulph, When thou hast trod that dark, that unknown Way, Canst thou return?âWhat, if the Change prove worse, O think, if thenâ Pho. NoâThought's my deadliest Foe. 'Tis lingring Racks and slow consuming Fires, And therefore to the Grave I'd fly to shun it. Eud. O fatal Error!âLike a restless Ghost, It will pursue, and haunt thee still, ev'n there, Perhaps in Forms more frightful. Death's a Name By which poor guessing Mortals are deceiv'd, 'Tis no where to be found. Thou fly'st in vain From Life, to meet again with that fly'st. How wilt thou curse thy Rashness then? How start, And shudder, and shrink back? Yet how avoid To put on thy new Being? Pho. SoâI thank thee! For now I'm quite undoneâI gave up All For thee before, but this; this Bosom Friend, My last Reserve.âThereâ [Throws away the Dagger. Tell me now, Eudocia, Cut off from Hope, deny'd the Food of Life, And yet forbid to die, what am I now? Or what will Fate do with me? Eud. Ohâ [Turns away weeping. Pho. Thou weep'st! Canst thou shed Tears, and yet not melt to Mercy? O say, e'er yet returning Madness seize me, Is there in all Futurity no Prospect, No distant Comfort? Not a glimmering Light To guide me thro' this Maze? Or must I now Sit down in Darkness, and despair for ever? [Here they both continue silent for some time. Pho. Still art thou silent?âSpeak, disclose my Doom That's now suspended in this awful Moment! O speakâFor now my Passions wait thy Voice; My beating Heart grows calm, my Blood stands still, Scarely I live, or only live to hear thee. Eud. If yetâbut can it be?âI fearâO Phocyas, Let me be silent still! Pho. Hear then this last This only Pray'r!âHeav'n will consent to this. Let me but follow thee, where-e'er thou goest, But see thee, hear thy Voice; be thou my Angel, To guide and govern my returning Steps, 'Till long Contrition and unweary'd Duty Shall expiate my Guilt. Then say, Eudocia, If, like a Soul anneal'd in purging Fires, After whole Years thou see'st me white again, When thou, ev'n thou shalt thinkâ Eud. No moreâThis shakes My Firmest Thought, and ifâ [Here a Cry is heard of Persons slaughter'd in the Camp. âWhat Shrieks of Death! I fear the treacherous Foeâagain! and louder! Then they've begun a fatal Harvest!âHaste, PreventâO wou'dst thou see me more with Comfort Fly, save 'em, save the threaten'd Lives of Christians, My Father and his Friends!âI dare not stayâ Heav'n be my Guide to shun this gathering Ruin. [Exit Eudocia. Manet Phocyas. Enter Caled. Cal. [entring.] SoâSlaughter do thy Work! âThese Hands look well. [Looking on his Hands. The jovial Hunter, e'er he quit the Field, First signs him in the Stag's warm vital Stream With Stains like these, to shew 'twas gallant Sport. Phocyas! Thou'rt met?âBut whether thou art here [Comes forward. A Friend or Foe I know not, if a Friend, Which is Eumenes' Tent? Pho. Holdâpass no further. Cal. Say'st thou, not pass? Pho. NoâOn thy Life, no further. Cal. What! Dost thou frown too?âsure, thou know'st me not! Pho. Not know thee?âYes, too well I know thee now, O murd'rous Fiend! Why all this Waste of Blood? Didst thou not promiseâ Cal. Promise?âInsolence! 'Tis well, 'tis wellâFor now I know thee too. Perfidious Mungril Slave! Thou double Traytor! False to thy first and to thy latter Vows! Villain!â Pho. That's wellâGo onâI swear I thank thee. Speak it again, and strike it thro' my Ear! A Villain!âYes, thou madest me so, thou Devil! And mindst me now what to demand from thee. Give, give me back my former self, my Honour, My Country's fair Esteem, my Friends, my Allâ Thou canst notâO thou Robber!âGive me then Revenge, or Death!âThe last I well deserve, That yielded up my Soul's best Wealth to thee, For which accurst be thou, and curst thy Prophet! Cal. Hear'st thou this, Mahomet?âBlaspheming Mouth! For this thou soon shalt chew the bitter Fruit Of Zacon's Tree, the Food of Fiends below. Goâspeed thee thitherâ [Pushing at him with his Lance, which Phocyas puts by, and kills him. Pho. Go thou first thy self. Cal. [falling.] O Dog! Thou gnaw'st my Heart!âFalse Mahomet! Is this, is this then my Reward forâOâ [Dies. [Exit Phocyas. Several Parties of Christians and Saracens pass over the further part of the Stage fighting. The former are beaten. At last Eumenes rallies them, and makes a Stand. Then Enter Abudah attended. Abu. Forbear, forbear, and sheath the bloody Sword! Eum. Abudah! Is this well? Abu. NoâI must own You've CauseâO Musselmen, look here, behold Where like a broken Spear your Arm of War Is thrown to Earth! Eum. Ha! Caled? Abu. Dumb and breathless. Then thus has Heav'n chastis'd us in thy Fall, And thee for violated Faith; farewel, Thou great but cruel Man! Eum. His Thirst of Blood In his own Blood is quench'd. Abu. Bear hence his Clay Back to Damascus. Cast a Mantle first O'er this sad Sight; so shou'd we hide his Faults.â Now hear, ye Servants of the Prophet, hear! A greater Death than this demands your Tears, For know, your Lord the Caliph is no more! Good Abubeker has breath'd out his Spirit To him that gave it. Yet your Caliph lives, Lives now in Omar. See, behold his Signet, Appointing me, such is his Will, to lead His faithful Armies warring here in Syria. Alas!âForeknowledge sure of this Event Guided his Choice!âobey me then your Chief. For you, O Christians! know, with Speed I came, On the first Notice of this foul Design, Or to prevent it, or repair your Wrongs. Your Goods shall be untouch'd, your Persons safe, Nor shall our Troops henceforth, on Pain of Death, Molest your March.âIf more you ask, 'tis granted. Eum. Still just and brave! Thy Virtues wou'd adorn A purer Faith! Thou better than thy Sect, That darest decline from that to Acts of Mercy! Pardon, Abudah, if thy honest Heart Makes us ev'n wish thee ours. Abu. [Aside.] O Power Supreme, That mad'st my Heart, and know'st its inmost Frame! If yet I err, O lead me into Truth, Or pardon unknown Error!âNow, Eumenes, Friends as we may be, let us part in Peace. [Exeunt severally. Enter Eudocia and Artamon. Eud. Alas! but is my Father safe? Art. Heav'n knows. I left him just preparing to engage; When doubtful of th'Event he bade me haste To warn his dearest Daughter of the Danger, And aid your speedy Flight. Eud. My Flight? But whither? O noâif he is lostâ Art. I hope, not so. The Noise is ceas'd. Perhaps they're beaten off. We soon shall know;âhere's one that can inform us. Enter First Officer. Soldier, thy Looks speak well. What says thy Tongue? 1 Off. The Foe's withdrawn; Abudah has been here, And has renew'd the Terms. Caled is kill'dâ Art. Holdâfirst, thank Heav'n for that! Eud. Where is Eumenes? 1 Off. I left him well; By his Command I came To search you out, and let you know this News. I've more; but Thatâ Art. Is bad, perhaps; so says This sudden Pause. Well, be it so; let's know it. 'Tis but Life's chequer'd Lot. 1 Off. Eumenes mourns A Friend's unhappy Fall; Herbis is slain; A settled Gloom seem'd to hang heavy on him, Th'Effect of Grief, 'tis thought, for his lost Son. When on the first Attack, like one that sought The welcome Means of Death, with desperate Valour He press'd the Foe, and met the Fate he wish'd. Art. See where Eumenes comes!âWhat's this? He seems To lead some wounded FriendâAlas 'tisâ [They withdraw to one side of the Stage. Enter Eumenes leading in Phocyas with an Arrow in his Breast. Eum. Give me thy Wound! O I cou'd bear it for thee. This Goodness melts my Heart. What, in a Moment Forgetting all thy Wrongs, in kind Embraces T'exchange Forgiveness thus! Pho. Moments are few And must not now be wasted. O Eumenes, Lend me thy helping Hand a little farther; O where, where is she? [They advance. Eum. Look, look here, Eudocia! Behold a Sight that calls for all our Tears. Eud. Phocyas, and wounded!âO what cruel Handâ Pho. No, 'twas a kind oneâSpare thy Tears, Eudocia! For mine are Tears of Joy.â Eud. Is't possible? Pho. 'Tis doneâthe Pow'rs supreme have heard my Pray'r, And prosper'd me with some fair Deeds this Day. I've fought once more, and for my Friends, my Country. By me the treacherous Chiefs are slain; awhile I stopp'd the Foe, till, warn'd by me before Of this their sudden March, Abudah came, But first this Random Shaft had reach'd my Breast. Life's mingled Scene is o'erâ'tis thus that Heav'n At once chastises and I hope accepts me, And now I wake as from the Sleep of Death. Eud. What shall I say to thee, to give thee Comfort? Pho. Say only thou forgiv'st me.âO Eudocia! No longer now my dazled Eyes behold thee Thro' Passion's Mists; my Soul now gazes on thee, And sees thee lovelier in unfading Charms, Bright as the shining Angel Host that stood! Whilst Iâbut there, it smartsâ Eud. Look down, look down, Ye pitying Pow'rs! and heal his pious Sorrow! Eum. 'Tis not too late, we hope, to give thee Help. See! yonder is my Tent. We'll lead thee thither. Come, enter there, and let thy Wound be dress'd. Perhaps it is not mortal. Pho. No? not mortal? No Flattery now. By all my Hopes hereafter, For the World's Empire I'd not lose this Death! Alas! I but keep in my fleeting Breath A few short Moments, till I have conjur'd you That to the World you witness my Remorse For my past Errors, and defend my Fame. For knowâsoon as this pointed Steel's drawn out Life follows thro' the Wound. Eud. What dost thou say? O touch not yet the broken Springs of Life! A thousand tender Thoughts rise in my Soul, How shall I give them Words? O, till this Hour I scarce have tasted Woe!âthis is indeed To partâbut Ohâ Pho. No moreâDeath now is painful! But say, my Friends, whilst I have Breath to ask, (For still methinks all your Concerns are mine) Whither have you design'd to bend your Journey? Eum. Constantinople is my last Retreat, If Heav'n indulge my Wish; there I've resolv'd To wear out the dark Winter of my Life, An old Man's Stock of Days, I hope not many. Eud. There will I dedicate my self to Heav'n. O Phocyas, for thy Sake, no Rival else Shall e'er possess my Heart. My Father too Consents to this my Vow. My vital Flame There, like a Taper on the holy Altar, Shall waste away; till Heav'n relenting hear Incessant Pray'rs for thee and for my self, And wing my Soul to meet with thine in Bliss.

Tears vainly flow for Errors learn'd too late, When timely Caution shou'd prevent our Fate. [Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
