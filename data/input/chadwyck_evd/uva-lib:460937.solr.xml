      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST REVEREND RICHARD CHENEVIX TRENCH D.D., ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN. Dear friend, of old true guide of pilgrims known, Leading their steps where Wisdom's fair pearls lie, With orient gems, in Truth's rich treasury, On to the altar-stairs and sapphire Throne,â Now reaping harvest which thou hast not sown, The heaped-up debt of far ancestral crimes, Bearing the brunt of these our troublous times, While mists are thick, and loud the night-winds moan; Scant leisure thine to look with studious eyes On these poor transcripts of a glorious page, The heathen's dim, âunconscious prophecies,â The dreams of Hellas in her golden age: Nay, gird thee to thy task, come good, come ill, And so 'mid storms and fears thy Master's hest fulfil. October 14, 1868.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I have been led by the interest which I found in the work of translating Sophocles, and in part also by the reception which my translation met with, to enter on another, and, in some respects, more difficult task, in which I have had predecessors at once more numerous and of higher mark. I leave it to others to compare the merits and defects of my work with theirs. I have adhered in it to the plan of using for the Choral Odes such unrhymed metres, observing the strophic and antistrophic arrangement, as seemed to me most analogous in their general rhythmical effect to those of the original; while, for the sake of those who cannot abandon their preference for the form with which they are more familiar, I have added, in an Appendix, a rhymed version of the chief Odes of the Oresteian trilogy. Those in the other dramas did not seem to me of equal interest, or to lend themselves with equal facility to a like attempt. I have for the most part followed the text of Mr Paley's edition of 1861, and, in common with all students of Ãschylos, I have to acknowledge a large debt of gratitude to him both for his textual criticism and for the varied amount of illustrative material which he has brought together in his notes. It is right to name Professor Conington also as at once among the most distinguished of those with whose labours my own will have to be compared, and as one who has done for Ãschylos at Oxford what Mr Paley has done at Cambridge, bringing to bear on the study of his dramas at once the accuracy of a critic and the insight of a poet. Had his work as a translator been carried further, had the late Dean of St Paul's left us more than the single tragedy of the Agamemnon, or my friend, Miss Swanwick, been able to complete what she began so well in her version of the Oresteian trilogy, I should probably not have undertaken the work which I have now brought to a conclusion. I have felt, however, that it was desirable for the large mass of readers to whom the culture which comes through the study of Greek literature in the inimitable completeness of the originals is more or less inaccessible, that there should be a translation within their reach, embracing all that has been left to us by one who takes all but the highest place among the tragic poets of Athens, and making it, as far as was possible, intelligible and interesting in its connexion with the history of Greek thought, political and theological. I have indicated by an asterisk (?) passages where the reading or the rendering is more or less conjectural, and in which therefore the student would do well to consult the notes of commentators. Passages which are regarded as spurious by editors of authority are placed between brackets [ ]. It only remains that I should once again acknowledge my obligations to my friend the Rev. Charles Hole, for much help kindly given in the progress of my work through the press. 6th October 1868.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personae. Watchman. Chorus of Argive Elders. ClytÃ¦mnestra. Herald, (Talthybios.) Agamemnon. Cassandra. Ãgisthos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. Ten years had passed since Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of MykenÅ, had led the Hellenes to TroÃ¯a to take vengeance on Alexandros (also known as Paris), son of Priam. For Paris had basely wronged Menelaos, king of Sparta, Agamemnon's brother, in that, being received by him as a guest, he enticed his wife Helena to leave her lord and go with him to TroÃ¯a. And now the tenth year had come, and Paris was slain, and the city of the TroÃ¯ans was taken and destroyed, and Agamemnon and the Hellenes were on their way homeward with the spoil and prisoners they had taken. But meanwhile ClytÃ¦mnestra too, Agamemnon's queen, had been unfaithful, and had taken as her paramour Ãgisthos, son of that Thyestes whom Atreus, his brother, had made to eat, unknowing, of the flesh of his own children. And now, partly led by her adulterer, and partly seeking to avenge the death of her daughter Iphigeneia, whom Agamemnon had sacrificed to appease the wrath of Artemis, and partly also jealous because he was bringing back Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, as his concubine, she plotted with Ãgisthos against her husband's life. But this was done secretly, and she stationed a guard on the roof of the royal palace to give notice when he saw the beacon-fires, by which Agamemnon had promised that he would send tidings that TroÃ¯a was taken. The unfaithfulness of ClytÃ¦mnestra and the murder of Agamemnon had entered into the Homeric cycle of the legends of the house of Atreus. In the Odyssey, however, Ãgisthos is the chief agent in this crime, (Odyss. iii. 264, iv. 91, 532, xi. 409); and the manner of it differs from that which Ãschylos has adopted. ClytÃ¦mnestra first appears as slaying both her husband and Cassandra in Pindar (Pyth. xi. 26.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENEâArgos. The palace of Agamemnon; statues of the Gods in front. Watchman on the roof. Time, night. Watchman. I ask the Gods a respite from these toils, This keeping at my post the whole year round, Wherein, upon the AtreidÃ¦'s roof reclined, Like dog, upon my elbow, I have learnt To know the company of stars of night, And those bright lords that deck the firmament, And winter bring to men, and harvest-tide; [The rising and the setting of the stars.] And now I watch for sign of beacon-torch, The flash of fire that bringeth news from TroÃ¯a, And tidings of its capture. So prevails A woman's manly-purposed, hoping heart; And when I keep my bed of little ease, Drenched with the dew, unvisited by dreams, (For fear, instead of sleep, my comrade is, So that in sound sleep ne'er I close mine eyes,) And when I think to sing a tune, or hum, (My medicine of song to ward off sleep,) Then weep I, wailing for this house's chance, No more, as erst, right well administered. Well! may I now find blest release from toils, When fire from out the dark brings tidings good. [Pauses, then springs up suddenly, seeing a light in the distance. Hail! thou torch-bearer of the night, that shedd'st Light as of morn, and bringest full array Of many choral bands in Argos met, Because of this success. Hurrah! hurrah! So clearly tell I Agamemnon's queen, With all speed rising from her couch to raise A cry of triumph o'er this beacon-fire Throughout the house, since Ilion's citadel Is taken, as full well that bright blaze shows. And I, yes, I myself, will dance a prelude; [Leaps and dances. For I shall score my lord's new turn of luck, This beacon-blaze my throw of triple six. The form of gambling from which the phrase is taken, had clearly become common in Attica among the class to which the watchman was supposed to belong, and had given rise to proverbial phrases like that in the text. The Greeks themselves supposed it to have been invented by the Lydians, (Herod. i. 94,) or Palamedes, one of the heroes of the tale of TroÃ¯a, but it enters also into Egyptian legends (Herod. ii. 122,) and its prevalence from remote antiquity in the farther East, as in the Indian stroy of Nala and Damayanti, makes it probable that it originated there. The game was commonly played, as the phrase shows, with three dice, the highest throw being that which gave three sixes. Ãschylos, it may be noted, appears in a lost drama, which bore the title of âPalamedes,â to have brought the game itself into his plot. It is referred to, as invented by that hero, in a fragment of Sophocles, (Fr. 380,) and again in the proverb,â âThe dice of Zeus have ever lucky throws.â â(Fr. 763.) Heaven grant that I with this mine hand may touch The dear hand of our king when he comes home! As to all else, the word is âHush!â An ox Here, also, the watchman takes up another common proverbial phrase, belonging to the same group as that of âkicking against the pricksâ in v. 1624. He has his reasons for silence, weighty as would be the tread of an ox to close his lips. Rests on my tongue; the house itself would tell Full clear, had it a voice. I'm fain to speak To those who know, forget with those who know not. [Exit. [Enter Chorus of Argive elders, chanting as they march to take up their position on the centre of the stage. A procession of women bearing torches is seen in the distance. Lo! the tenth year now is passing Since, of Priam great avengers, Menelaos, Agamemnon, Double-throned and double-sceptred, Power from sovran Zeus derivingâ Mighty pair of the AtreidÃ¦â Raised a fleet of thousand vessels Of the Argives from our country, Potent helpers in their warfare, Shouting cry of Ares fiercely, E'en as vultures shriek who hover, Wheeling, whirling o'er their eyrie, In wild sorrow for their nestlings, With their oars of stout wings rowing, Having lost the toil that bound them To their callow fledgelings' couches. But some high God,âor Apollo, Zeus, or Pan,âthe shrill cry hearing, Cry of birds that are his clients, The vultures stand, i.e., to the rulers of Heaven, in the same relation as the foreign sojourners in Athens, the Metoecs, did to the citizens under whose protection they placed themselves. Sendeth forth on men transgressing Erinnys, slow but sure avenger; So against young Alexandros Alexandros, the other name of Paris, the seducer of Helen. Atreus' sons the great King sendeth, Zeus, of host and guest protector: He, for bride with many a lover, Will to Danai give and TroÃ¯ans Many wrestlings, sinews-trying, When the knee in dust is crouching, And the spear-shaft in the prelude Of the battle snaps asunder. But as things are now, so are they, So, as destined, shall the end be. Nor by bitter tears in secret, Nor by secret full libations, Shall he soothe the wrath unbending Caused by sacred rites left fireless. The words, perhaps, refer to the grief of Menelaos, as leading him to neglect the wonted sacrifices to Zeus, but it seems better to see in them a reference to the sin of Paris. He, at least, who had carried off his host's wife, had not offered acceptable sacrifices, had neglected all sacrifices to Zeus Xenios, the God of host and guest. The allusion to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, which some have found here, and the wrath of ClytÃ¦mnestra, which Agamemnon will fail to soothe, seems more far-fetched. We, with old frame little honoured, Left behind that host are staying, Resting strength like that of childhood's On our staff: for in the bosom Of the boy, as monarch reigning, Life's young sap but old age equals; Ares not as yet keeps guard there: And the man in age exceeding, When the leaf is sere and withered, Goes with three feet on his journey; An allusion, such as the audience would catch and delight in, to the well-known enigma of the Sphinx. See Sophocles, (Trans.,) p. 1. Not more Ares-like than boyhood, Like a day-seen dream he wanders. [Enter ClytÃ¦mnestra, followed by the procession of torch-bearers. But thou, of Tyndareus the daughter, Queen of Argos, ClytÃ¦mnestra, What has happened? what news cometh? What perceiving, on what tidings Leaning, dost thou put in motion All this solemn, great procession? Of the Gods who guard the city, All that dwell in light or darkness, Of the heaven, and of the market, Lo! with thy gifts blaze the altars; And through all the expanse of Heaven, Here and there, the torch-fire rises, With the flowing, pure persuasion Of the holy unguent nourished, And the chrism rich and kingly From the treasure-store's recesses. Telling what of this thou canst tell, What is right for thee to utter, Be a healer of my trouble, Trouble now my soul disturbing, While anon fond hope displaying Sacrificial signs propitious, Wards off anxious care unsated, Sorrow mind and heart corroding. [The Chorus, taking their places round the central thymele, begin their song. The Chorus, though too old to take part in the expedition, are yet able to tell both of what passed as the expedition started, and of the terrible fulfilment of the omens which they had seen. The two eagles are, of course, in the symbolism of prophecy, the two chieftains, Menalaos and Agamemnon. The âwhite feathersâ of the one may point to the less heroic character of Menelaos: so, in v. 123, they are of âdiverse mood.â The hare whom they devour is, in the first instance, TroÃ¯a, and so far the omen is good, portending the success of the expedition; but, as Artemis hates the fierceness of the eagles, so there is, in the eyes of the seer, a dark token of danger from her wrath against the AtreidÃ¦. Either their victory will be sullied by cruelty which will bring down vengeance, or else there is some secret sin in the past which must be atoned for by a terrible sacrifice. In the legend followed by Sophocles, (Electr. 566,) Agamemnon had offended Artemis by slaying a doe sacred to her, as he was hunting. In the manifold meanings of such omens there is, probably, a latent suggestion of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia by the two chieftains, though this was at the time hidden from the seer. The fact that they are seen on the right, not on the left hand, was itself ominous of good. Strophe. Able am I to utter, setting forth The might from omens sprung, What met the heroes as they journeyed on, (For still, by God's great gift, My age, yet linked with strength, Breathes suasive power of song,) How the AchÃ¦ans' twin-throned majesty, Accordant sovereigns of the youth of Hellas, With spear and vengeful hand, Were sent by fierce, strong bird 'gainst Teucrian shore, King of the birds to kings of ships appearing, One black, with white tail one, Near to the palace, on the spear-hand side, On station seen of all, A pregnant hare devouring with her young, Robbed of all runs to come: Wail as for Linos, wail, wail bitterly, And yet may good prevail! The song of Linos, originally the dirge with which men mourned for the death of Linos, the minstrel-son of Apollo and Urania, brother of Orpheus, who was slain by Heracles,âa type, like Thammuz and Adonis, of life prematurely closed and bright hopes never to be fulfilled,âhad come to be the representative of all songs of mourning. So Hesiod. (in Eustath. on Hom. Il., vii. 569) speaks of the name, as applied to all funeral dirges over poets and minstrels. So Herodotos (ii. 79) compares it, as the type of this kind of music among the Greeks, with what he found in Egypt connected with the name of Maneros, the only son of the first king of Egypt, who died in the bloom of youth. The name had, therefore, as definite a connotation for a Greek audience as the words Miserere or Jubilate would have for us, and ought not, I believe, to disappear from the translation. Antistrophe. And the wise prophet of the army seeing The brave AtreidÃ¦ twain Of diverse mood, knew those that tore the hare, And those that led the host; And thus as augur spake: âOne day this armament Shall Priam's city sack, and all the herds Owned by the people, countless, by the towers, Fate shall with force lay low. Only take heed lest any wrath of Gods Dim the great curb of TroÃ¯a yet encamped, Struck down before its time; For Artemis the chaste that house doth hate, Her father's wingÃ¨d hounds, Who slay the mother with her unborn young, And loathes the eagles' feast. Wail as for Linos, wail, wail bitterly; And yet may good prevail! Epode. For she, the fair One, though so kind of heart To fresh-dropt dew from mighty lion's womb, The comparison of a lion's whelps to dew-drops, bold as the figure is, has something in it analogous to that with which we are more familiar, describing the children, or the army of a king, as the âdewâ from âthe womb of the morning.ââPs. cx. 3. And young that suck the teats Of all that roam the fields, Yet prays Him bring to pass The portents of those birds, The omens good yet also full of dread. And PÃ¦an I invoke As Healer, lest she on the Danai send Delays that keep the ships Long time with hostile blasts, So urging on a new, strange sacrifice, Unblest, unfestivalled, The sacrifice, i.e., was to be such as could not, according to the customary ritual, form a feast for the worshippers. By natural growth artificer of strife, Bearing far other fruit than wife's true fear; For there abideth yet, Fearful, recurring still, Ruling the house, full subtle, unforgetting, Vengeance for children slain.â The dark words look at once before and after, back to the murder of the sons of Thyestes, forward, though of this the seer knew not, to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. Such things, with great good mingled, Calchas spake, In voice that pierced the air, As destined by the birds that crossed our path To this our kingly house; And in accord with them, Wail as for Linos, wail, wail bitterly; And yet may good prevail. Stroph. I. O Zeusâwhate'er He be, As a part of the drama the whole passage that follows is an assertion by the Chorus that in this their trouble they will turn to no other God, invoke no other name, but that of the Supreme Zeus. But it can hardly be doubted that they have a meaning beyond this, and are the utterance by the poet of his own theology. In the second part of the Promethean trilogy (all that we now know of it) he had represented Zeus as ruling in the might of despotic sovereignty, the representative of a Power which men could not resist, but also could not love, inflicting needless sufferings on the sons of men. Now he has grown wiser. The sovereignty of Zeus is accepted as part of the present order of the world; trust in Him brings peace; the pain which He permits is the one only way to wisdom. The stress laid upon the name of Zeus implies a wish to cleave to the religion inherited from the older Hellenes, as contrasted with those with which their intercourse with the East had made the Athenians familiar. Like the voice which came to Epimenides, as he was building a sanctuary to the Muses, bidding him dedicate it not to them but to Zeus, (Diog. Laert. i. 10,) it represents a faint approximation to a truer, more monotheistic creed than that of the popular mythology. If that Name please Him well, By that on Him I call: Weighing all other names I fail to guess Aught else but Zeus, if I would cast aside, Clearly, in very deed, From off my soul this weight of vaguest care. Antistroph. I. Nor He who erst was great, The two mighty ones who have passed away are Uranos and Cronos, the representatives in Greek mythology of the earlier stages of the world's history, (1) mere material creation, (2) an ideal period of harmony, a golden, Saturnian age, preceding the present order of divine government with its mingled good and evil. Comp. Hesiod. Theogon. 459. Full of the might to war, Avails now; He is gone; And He who next came hath departed too, His victor meeting; but if one should hymn The conqueror Zeus with zeal, His shall be all the wisdom of the wise; Stroph. II. Yea, Zeus, who leadeth men in wisdom's way, And fixeth fast the law, Wisdom by pain to gain; And slowly dropping on the heart in sleep Comes crime-recording care, And makes the unwilling yield to wiser thoughts: And doubtless this too comes from grace of Gods, Seated in might upon their awful thrones. Antistroph. II. And thus of those AchÃ¦an ships the chief, The elder one, no blame Casting on any seer, But tempered to the fate that on him smote. ... When that AchÃ¦an host Were vexed with adverse winds and failing stores, Still kept where Chalkis in the distance lies, And the vexed waves in Aulis ebb and flow; Stroph. III. And breezes from the Strymon sweeping down, Breeding delays and hunger, driving forth Our men in wandering course, On seas without a port, Sparing nor ships, nor rope, nor sailing gear, With doubled months wore down the Argive host; And when for that wild storm Another charm far harder for our chiefs The prophet spake, and uttered âArtemis,â The seer saw his augury fulfilled. When he uttered the name of Artemis it was pregnant with all the woe which he had foreboded at the outset. In tone that pierced the air, The AtreidÃ¦ smote their staves upon the ground, And could not stay their tears. Antistroph. III. And then the old king lifted up his voice, And spake, âHard fate it is to disobey; Hard too to slay my child, The pride and joy of home, Polluting with the streams of maiden's blood Her father's hands upon the altar steps. What course is free from ill? How lose my ships and fail of mine allies? 'Tis meet with strong desire to seek a rite That shall the storm-winds soothe, E'en though it be with blood of maiden pure; May all end well at last!â Stroph. III. So when he himself had harnessed To the yoke of Fate unbending, With a blast of strange, new feeling, Sweeping o'er his heart and spirit, Aweless, godless, and unholy, He his thoughts and purpose altered To full measure of all daring, (Still base counsel's fatal frenzy, Wretched primal source of evils, Gives to mortal hearts strange boldness,) And at last his heart did harden To slay his daughter as a victim, Help in war for woman guilty, Victim for the good ships' safety. Antistroph. III. All her prayers and eager callings On the tender name of Father, All her young and maiden freshness, They but set at nought, those rulers, In their passion for the battle. And her father gave commandment To the servants of the Goddess, When the prayer was o'er to lift her, Like a kid, above the altar, In her garments wrapt, face downwards,â So that the blood might fall upon the altar, as the knife was drawn across the throat. Yea, to seize with all their courage, And that o'er her lips of beauty Should be set a watch to hinder Words of curse against the houses, With the gag's strength silence-working. The whole passage should be compared with the magnificent description in Lucretius i. 84â101. Stroph. IV. And she upon the ground Pouring rich folds of robes in saffron dyed, Cast at each one of those who sacrificed A piteous glance that pierced, Seen like a pictured form; Beautiful as a picture, and as motionless and silent also. The art, young as it was, had already reached the stage when it supplied to the poet an ideas standard of perfection. Other allusions to it are found in vv. 774, 1300. And wishing,âall in vain,â To speak; as oftentimes In those her father's hospitable halls She sang, a maiden pure with chastest song, And her dear father's life That poured its threefold cup of praise to God, The words point to the ritual of Greek feasts, which assigned the first libation to Zeus and the Olympian Gods, the second to the Heroes, the third to Zeus in his special character as Saviour and Preserver; the last was commonly accompanied by a pÃ¦an, hymn of praise. The life of Agamemnon is described as one which had good cause to offer many such libations. Iphigeneia had sung many such pÃ¦ans. Crowned with all choicest good, She with a daughter's love Was wont to celebrate. Antistroph. IV. What then ensued mine eyes Saw not, nor may I tell, but Calchas' arts Were found not fruitless. Justice turns the scale For those to whom through pain At last comes wisdom's gain. But for our future fate, Since help for it is none, Good-bye to it before it comes, and this Has the same end as wailing premature, For with to-morrow's dawn It will come clear; may good luck crown our fate! So prays the one true guard, Nearest and dearest found, Of this our Apian land. The mythical explanation of this title for the Argive territory is found in the Suppl. v. 256, and its real meaning will be discussed in a note on that passage. The Chief of the Chorus turns to ClytÃ¦mnestra, and her train of handmaids. Chor. I come, O ClytÃ¦mnestra, honouring Thy majesty: 'tis meet to pay respect To a chief's wife, the man's throne empty left: But whether thou hast heard good news, or else In hopes of tidings glad dost sacrifice, I fain would hear, yet will not silence blame. ClytÃ¦m. May Morning, as the proverb runs, appear Bearing glad tidings from his mother Night; To speak of Morning as the child of Night was, we may well believe, among the earliest parables of nature. In its mythical form it appears in Hesiod., (Thegon. 123,) but its traces are found wherever, as among Hebrews, Athenians, Germans, men reckoned by nights rather than by days, and spoke of âthe evening and the morningâ rather than of âday and night.â Joy thou shalt learn beyond thy hope to hear; For Argives now have taken Priam's city. Chor. What? Thy words sound so strange they flit by me. ClytÃ¦m. The AchÃ¦ans hold TroÃ¯a. Speak I clear enough? Chor. Joy creeps upon me, drawing forth my tears. ClytÃ¦m. Of loyal heart thine eyes give token true. Chor. What witness sure hast thou of these events? ClytÃ¦m. Full clear (how else?) unless the God deceive. The God thought of is, as in v. 272, HephÃ¦stos, as being Lord of the Fire, that had brought the tidings. Chor. Reliest thou on dreams or visions seen? ClytÃ¦m. I place no trust in mind weighed down with sleep. It is not without significance that ClytÃ¦mnestra scorns the channel of divine instruction of which the Chorus had spoken with such reverence. The dramatist puts into her mouth the language of those who scoffed at the notion that truth might come to the soul in âvisions of the night,â when âdeep sleep falleth upon men.â So Sophocles puts like thoughts into the mouth of Jocasta, (Åd. King, vv. 709, 858.) Chor. Hath then some wingless omen charmed thy soul? Omens came from the flight of birds. An omen which was not trustworthy, or belonged to some lower form of divination, might therefore be spoken of as wingless. But the word may possibly be intensive, not negative, âswift-winged,â and then refer generically to that form of divination. ClytÃ¦m. My mind thou scorn'st, as though 'twere but a girl's. Chor. What time has passed since they the city sacked? ClytÃ¦m. This very night, the mother of this morn. Chor. What herald could arrive with speed like this? ClytÃ¦m. HephÃ¦stos flashing forth bright flames from Ida: Beacon to beacon from that courier fire Sent on its tidings; Ida to the rock The description that follows, over and above its general interest, had, probably, for an Athenian audience, that of representing the actual succession of beacon-stations, by which they, in the course of the wars under Pericles, had actually received intelligence from the coasts of Asia. A glance at the map will show the fitness of the places namedâIda, Lemnos, Athos, Makistos, (a mountain in EubÅa,) Messapion, (on the coast of BÅotia,) over the plains of the AsÃ´pos to KithÃ¦ron, in the south of the same province, then over Gorgopis, a bay of the Corinthian Gulf, to Ãgiplanctos in Megaris, then across to a headland overlooking the Saronic Gulf, to the ArachnÃ¦an hill in Argolis. The word âcourier-fireâ connects itself also with the system of posts or messengers, which the Persian kings seem to have been the first to organise, and which impressed the minds both of Hebrews, (Esth. viii. 14,) and Greeks, (Herod. viii. 98,) by their regular transmission of the king's edicts, or of special news. HermÃ¦an named, in Lemnos: from the isle The height of Athos, dear to Zeus, received A third great torch of flame, and, lifted up, So as on high to skim the broad sea's back, The stalwart fire rejoicing went its way; The pine-wood, like a sun, sent forth its light Of golden radiance to Makistos' watch; And he, with no delay, nor unawares Conquered by sleep, performed his courier's part: Far off the torch-light, to Euripos' straits Advancing, tells it to Messapion's guards: They, in their turn, lit up and passed it on, Kindling a pile of dry and aged heath. Still strong and fresh the torch, not yet grown dim, Leaping across AsÃ´pos' plain, in guise Like a bright moon, towards KithÃ¦ron's rock, Roused the next station of the courier flame. And that far-travelled light the sentries there Refused not, burning more than all yet named: And then the light swooped o'er GorgÃ´pis' lake, And passing on to Ãgiplanctos' mount, Bade the bright fire's due order tarry not; And they, enkindling boundless store, send on A mighty beard of flame, and then it passed The headland e'en that looks on Saron's gulf, Still blazing. On it swept, until it came To ArachnÃ¦an heights, the watch-tower near; Then here on the AtreidÃ¦'s roof it swoops, This light, of Ida's fire no doubtful heir. Such is the order of my torch-race games; One from another taking up the course, Our ignorance of the details of the Lampadephoria, or âtorch-race games,â in honour of the fire-God, Prometheus, makes the allusion to them somewhat obscure. As described by Pausanias, (I. xxx. 2,) the runners started with lighted torches from the altar of Prometheus in the Academeia and ran towards the city. The first who reached the goal with his torch still burning became the winner. If all the torches were extinguished, then all were losers. As so described, however, there is no succession, no taking the torch from one and passing it on to another, like that described here and in the well-known line of Lucretius, (ii. 78.) âEt quasi cursores vitaÃ¯ lampada tradunt.â (And they, as runners, pass the torch of life.) On the other hand, there are descriptions which show that such a transfer was the chief element of the game. This is, indeed, implied both in this passage and in the comparison between the game and the Persian courier-system in Herod. viii. 98. The two views may be reconciled by supposing (1) that there were sets of runners, vying with each other as such, rather than individually, or (2) that a runner whose speed failed him though his torch kept burning, was allowed to hand it on to another who was more likely to win the race, but whose torch was out. The next line seems meant to indicate where the comparison failed. In the torch-race which ClytÃ¦mnestra describes there had been no contest. One and the self-same fire (the idea of succession passing into that of continuity) had started and had reached the goal, and so had won the prize. But here the winner is both first and last; And this sure proof and token now I tell thee, Seeing that my lord hath sent it me from TroÃ¯a. Chor. I to the Gods, O Queen, will pray hereafter, But fain would I hear all thy tale again, E'en as thou tell'st, and satiate my wonder. ClytÃ¦m. This very day the AchÃ¦ans TroÃ¯a hold. I trow full diverse cry pervades the town: Pour in the same vase vinegar and oil, And you would call them enemies, not friends; And so from conquerors and from captives now The cries of varied fortune one may hear. For these, low-fallen on the carcases Of husbands or of brothers, children too By aged fathers, mourn their dear ones' death, And that with throats that are no longer free. And those the hungry toil of night-long guard, After the battle, at their breakfast sets; Not billeted in order fixed and clear, But just as each his own chance fortune grasps, They in the captive houses of the TroÃ¯ans Dwell, freed at last from all the night's chill frosts, And dews of Heaven, for now, poor wretches, they Will sleep all night without the sentry's watch; And if they reverence well the guardian Gods Of that new-conquered country, and their shrines, Then they, the captors, will not captured be. Ah! let no evil lust attack the host Conquered by greed, to plunder what they ought not: For yet they need return in safety home, Doubling the goal to run their backward race. The complete foot-race was always to the column which marked the end of the course, round it, and back again. In getting to TroÃ¯a, therefore, but half the race was done. But should the host come sinning 'gainst the Gods, Then would the curse of those that perishÃ¨d Wake, e'en though sudden evils might not fall. Such thoughts are mine, mere woman though I be. May good prevail beyond all doubtful chance! For I have got the blessing of great joy. Chor. Thou, lady, kindly, like a sage, dost speak, And I, on hearing thy sure evidence Prepare myself to give the Gods due thanks; For they have wrought full meed for all our toil. [Exit ClytÃ¦m. with her train. O Zeus our King! O Night belovÃ¨d, Of great glories mighty winner, Who upon the towers of TroÃ¯a Casted'st snare of closest meshes, So that none full-grown or youthful Could o'erleap the net of bondage, Woe of universal capture;â Zeus, of host and guest protector, Who hath wrought these things, I worship; He long since on Alexandros Stretched his bow that so his arrow Might not sweep at random, missing, Or beyond the stars shoot upwards. Stroph. I. Yes, one may say, 'tis Zeus whose blow they feel; This one may clearly trace: They fared as He decreed: Yea, one there was who said âThe Gods deign not to care for mortal men Dramatically the words refer to the practical impiety of evildoers like Paris, with, perhaps, a half-latent allusion to that of ClytÃ¦mnestra. But it can hardly be doubted that for the Athenian audience it would have a more special significance, as a protest against the growing scepticism, what in a later age would have been called the Epicureanism, of the age of Pericles, It is the assertion of the belief of Ãschylos in the moral government of the world. The very vagueness of the singular, âOne there was,â would lead the hearers to think of some teacher like Anaxagoras, whom they suspected of Atheism. By whom the grace of things inviolable Is trampled under foot.â No fear of God had he: Now is it to the children manifest The Chorus sees in the overthrow of TroÃ¯a, an instance of this righteous retribution. The audience were, perhaps, intended to think also of the punishment which had fallen on the Persians for the sacrilegious acts of their fathers. The âthings inviolableâ are the sanctities of the ties of marriage and hospitality, both of which Paris had set at nought. Of those who, overbold, Breathed rebel War beyond the bounds of Right, Their houses overfilled with precious store Above the golden mean. Ah! let our lot be free from all that hurts, So that the wise of heart May ward it off from him, That it may be enough Right-judging heart to gain. Since still there is no bulwark strong in wealth Against destruction's doom, For one who in the pride of wantonness Spurns the great altar of the Right and Just. Antistroph. I. Him woeful, subtle Impulse urges on, Resistless in her might, AtÃ¨'s far-scheming child: All remedy is vain. It is not hidden, but is manifest, That mischief with its horrid gleaming light; And, like to worthless bronze, Here, and again in v. 612, we have a similitude drawn from the metallurgy of Greek artists. Good bronze, made of copper and tin, takes the green rust which collectors prize, but when rubbed, the brightness reappears. If zinc be substituted for tin, as in our brass, or mixed largely with it, the surface loses its polish, oxidises and becomes black. It is, however, doubtful whether this combination of metals was at the time in use, and the words may simply refer to different degrees of excellence in bronze properly so called. By friction tried and tests, It turns to tarnished blackness in its hue: Since, boy-like, he pursues A bird upon its flight, and so doth bring Upon his city scourge intolerable. And no God hears his prayer, But bringeth low the unjust, Who deals with deeds like this. Thus was it Paris came Unto the palace of great Atreus' sons, And stole its queen away, And so left brand of shame indelible Upon the board where host and guest had sat. Stroph. II. She leaving to her countrymen at home Wild din of spear and shield and ships of war, And bringing, as her dower, To Ilion doom of death, Passed very swiftly through the palace gates, Daring what none should dare; And many a wailing cry They raised, the minstrel prophets of the house, âWoe for that kingly home! Woe for that kingly home and for its chiefs! Woe for the marriage-bed and traces left Of wife who loved her lord!â There stands he silent; foully wronged and yet Uttering no word of scorn, In a corrupt passage like this, the text of which has been so variously restored and rendered, it may be well to give at least one alternative version: âThere stands she silent, with no honour met, Nor yet with words of scorn, Sweetest to see of all that he has lost.â The words, as so taken, refer to the vision of Helen, described in the lines that follow. Another, for the line âBeholding,â &amp;c., .... would give, âBelieving not he sees the lost one there.â In deepest woe perceiving she is gone; And in his yearning love For one beyond the sea, A ghost shall seem to queen it o'er the house; The grace of sculptured forms The art of Pheidias had already made it natural at Athens to speak of kings as decorating their palaces with the life-size busts or statues of those they loved. Is loathÃ¨d by her lord, And in the penury of life's bright eyes All AphroditÃ¨'s charm To utter wreck is gone. Antistroph. II. And phantom shades in visions of the night Come full of sorrow, bringing vain delight; For vain it is, when one Sees seeming shows of good, And gliding through his hands the dream is gone, After a moment's space, On wings that follow still Upon the path where sleep goes to and fro.â Such are the woes at home Upon the altar hearth, and worse than these. But on a wider scale for those who went From Hellas' ancient shore, A sore distress that causeth pain of heart Is seen in every house. Yea, many things there are that touch the quick: For those whom each did send He knoweth; but, instead Of living men, there come to each man's home Funereal urns alone, And ashes of the dead. Stroph. III. For Ares, trafficking for golden coin The lifeless shapes of men, And in the rush of battle holding scales, Sends now from Ilion Dust from the funeral pyre,â A burden sore to loving friends at home, And bitterly bewailed,â Filling the brazen urn With well-smoothed ashes in the place of men; And with high praise they mourn This hero skilled and valiant in the fight, And that who in the battle nobly fell, All for another's wife: And other words some murmur secretly; And jealous discontent Against the AtreidÃ¦, champions in the suit, Creeps on all stealthily; And some around the wall, In full and goodly form have sepulture There upon Ilion's soil, And their foes' land inters its conquerors. Antistroph. III. And so the murmurs of their subjects rise With sullen discontent, And do the work of solemn interdict; And now my boding fear Awaits some news of ill, At present wrapt in blackness of the night. Not heedless are the Gods Of shedders of much blood, And the dark-robed Erinnyes in due time, By adverse chance of life, Place him who prospers in unrighteousness In gloom obscure; and once among the unseen, There is no help for him. Fame in excess is but a perilous thing; For on men's quivering eyes Is hurled by Zeus the blinding thunder-bolt. I praise the good success That rouses not God's wrath; Ne'er be it mine a city to lay waste, Here again one may note a protest against the aggressive policy of Pericles, an assertion of the principle that a nation should be content with independence, without aiming at supremacy. Nor, as a prisoner, see My life wear on beneath another's power! Epode. And now at bidding of the courier flame, The herald of good news, A rumour swift spreads through the city streets, But who knows clearly whether it be true, Or whether God has mingled lies with it? Who is so childish or so reft of sense, As with his heart a-glow At that fresh uttered message of the flame, Then to wax sad at changing rumour's sound? It suits the mood that sways a woman's mind To pour thanksgiving ere the truth is seen: Quickly, with rapid steps, too credulous, The limit which a woman sets to trust Advances evermore; Perhaps passively, âSoon suffers trespassers.â And with quick doom of death A rumour spread by woman perishes. [As the Chorus ends, a Herald is seen approaching, his head wreathed with olive. As the play opens on the morning of the day on which TroÃ¯a was taken, and now we have the arrivals, first, of the herald, and then of Agamemnon, after the capture has been completed, and the spoil divided, and the fleet escaped a storm, an interval of some days must be supposed between the two parts of the play, the imaginary law of the unities notwithstanding. Soon we shall know the sequence of the torches Light-giving, and of all the beacon-fires, If they be true; or if, as 'twere a dream, This sweet light coming hath beguiled our minds. I see a herald coming from the shore, With olive boughs o'ershadowed, and the dust, The customary adornment of heralds who brought good news. Comp. Sophocles, Åd. K. v. 83. The custom prevailed for many centuries, and is recognised by Dante, Purg. ii. 70, as usual in his time in Italy. Dry sister-twin of mire, So in the Seven against Thebes, (v. 494) smoke is called âthe sister of fire.â announces this, That neither without voice, nor kindling blaze Of wood upon the mountains, he will signal With smoke from fire, but either he will come With clear speech bidding us rejoice, or else ... [pauses. The word opposed to this I much mislike. May good completion good beginnings crown! Who for our city utters other prayers, May he himself his soul's great error reap! Herald. Hail, soil of this my Argive fatherland, Now in the light of the tenth year I reach thee, Though many hopes are shattered, gaining one. For never did I think in Argive land To die, and share the tomb that most I craved. Now hail! thou land; and hail! thou light of day: Zeus our great sovran, and thou Pythian king, No longer darting arrows from thy bow. A probable reference, not only to the story, but to the actual words of Homer, Il. i., 45â52. Full hostile wast thou by Scamandros' banks; Now be thou Saviour, yea, and Healer found, O king Apollo! And the Gods of war, These I invoke; my patron Hermes too, Dear herald, whom all heralds reverence,â Those heroes, too, that sent us, Specially the Dioscuri, Castor and Polydeukes.âgraciously To welcome back the host that war has spared. Hail, O ye royal dwellings, home beloved! Ye solemn thrones, and Gods who face the sun! Such a position (especially in the case of Zeus or Apollo) was common in the temples both of Greece and Rome, and had a very obvious signification. As the play was performed, the actual hour of the day probably coincided with that required by the dramatic sequence of events, and the statues of the Gods were so placed on the stage as to catch the rays of the morning sun when the herald entered. Hence the allusion to the bright âcheerful glancesâ would have a visible as well as ethical fitness. If e'er of old, with cheerful glances now After long time receive our king's array. For he is come, in darkness bringing light To you and all alike, King Agamemnon. Salute him with all grace; for so 'tis meet, Since he hath dug up TroÃ¯a with the spade Of Zeus the Avenger, and the plain laid waste; Gone are their altars and the shrines of Gods; The seed of all the land is rooted out. This yoke of bondage casting over TroÃ¯a, Our chief, the elder of the AtreidÃ¦, comes, A man full blest, and worthiest of high honour Of all that are. For neither Paris' self, Nor his accomplice city now can boast Their deed exceeds its punishment. For he, Found guilty on the charge of rape and theft, It formed part of the guilt of Paris, that, besides his seduction of Helena, he had carried off part of the treasures of Menelaos. Hath lost his prize and brought his father's house, With lands and all, to waste and utter wreck; And Priam's sons have double forfeit paid. The idea of a payment twofold the amount of the wrong done, as a complete satisfaction to the sufferer, was common in the early jurisprudence both of Greeks and Hebrews, (Exod. xxii. 4â7.) In some cases it was even more, as in the four or fivefold restitution of Exod. xxii. l. In the grand opening of Isaiah's message of glad tidings the fact that Jerusalem has received âdouble for all her sinsâ is made the ground on the strength of which she may now hope for pardon. Comp. also Isa. lxi. 7; Zech. ix. 12. Chor. Joy, joy, thou herald of the AchÃ¦an host! Her. All joy is mine: I shrink from death no more. Chor. Did love for this thy fatherland so try thee? Her. So that mine eyes weep tears for very joy. Chor. Disease full sweet then this ye suffered from ... Her. How so? When taught, I shall thy meaning master. Chor. Ye longed for us who loved you in return. Her. Say'st thou this land its yearning host yearned o'er? Chor. Yea, so that oft I groaned for gloom of soul. Her. Whence came these bodings that an army hates? Chor. Silence I've held long since a charm for ill. Her. How! When your lords were absent, feared ye any? Chor. To use thy words, death now would welcome be. Her. Good is the issue; but in so long time Some things, one well might say, have prospered well, And some give cause for murmurs. Save the Gods, Who free from sorrow lives out all his life? For should I tell of toils, and how we lodged Full hardly, seldom putting in to shore, Perhaps, âFull hardly, and the close and crowded decks.â And then with couch full hard. ... What gave us not Good cause for mourning? What ill had we not As daily portion? And what passed on land, That brought yet greater hardship: for our beds Were under our foes' walls, and meadow mists From heaven and earth still left us wringing wet, A constant mischief to our garments, making Our hair as shaggy as the beasts'. So stress is laid upon this form of hardship, as rising from the climate of TroÃ¯a, by Sophocles. Aias, 1206. And if One spoke of winter frosts that killed the birds, By Ida's snow-storms made intolerable, One may conjecture that here also, as with the passage describing the succession of beacon fires, (vv. 281â314,) the description would have for an Athenian audience the interest of recalling personal reminiscences of some recent campaign in ThrakÃ¨, or on the coasts of Asia. Or heat, when Ocean in its noontide couch Windless reclined and slept without a wave. ... But why lament o'er this? Our toil is past; Past too is theirs who in the warfare fell, So that no care have they to rise again. Why should I count the number of the dead, Or he that lives mourn o'er adversity? To change and chance I bid a long Farewell: With us, the remnant of the Argive host, Good fortune wins, no ills as counterpoise. So it is meet to this bright sun we boast, Who travel homeward over land and sea; âThe Argive host who now have captured TroÃ¯a, These spoils of battle We may, perhaps, think of the herald, as he speaks, placing some representative trophy upon the pegs on the pedestals of the statues of the great Gods of Hellas, whom he had invoked on his entrance. to the Gods of Hellas Hang on their pegs, enduring prize and joy.â Or, âSo that to this bright morn our sons may boast, As they o'er land and ocean take their flight, âThe Argive host of old, who captured TroÃ¯a, These spoils of battle to the Gods of Hellas, Hung on their pegs, a trophy of old days.â Hearing these things we ought to bless our country And our commanders; and the grace of Zeus That wrought this shall be honoured. My tale's told. Chor. Thy words o'ercome me, and I say not nay; To learn good keeps youth's freshness with the old. The house and ClytÃ¦mnestra well may care Most for these things, yet me too they enrich. Enter ClytÃ¦mnestra. ClytÃ¦m. I long ago uplifted strains of joy, When the first fiery courier came by night, Telling of TroÃ¯a taken and laid waste: And then one girding at me spake, âDost think, Trusting in beacons, TroÃ¯a is laid waste? This heart elate is just a woman's way.â In words like these they made me out distraught; Yet still I sacrificed, and with a strain Shrill as a woman's, they, now here, now there, Throughout the city hymns of blessing raised In shrines of Gods, and lulled to gentle sleep The fragrant flame that on the incense fed. And now why need'st thou lengthen out thy words? I from the king himself the tale shall learn; And that I show all zeal to welcome back My honoured lord on his return (for what Is brighter joy for wife to see than this, When God has brought her husband back from war, To open wide her gates?) tell my lord this, âTo come with all his speed, the city's idol;â And âmay he find a faithful wife at home, Such as he left her, noble watch-dog still For him, and hostile to his enemies; And like in all things else, who has not broken One seal of his in all this length of time.â The husband, on his departure, sealed up his special treasures. It was the glory of the faithful wife or the trusty steward to keep these seals unbroken. No pleasure have I known, nor scandal ill With any other more than ... stains on bronze. There is an ambiguity, possibly an intentional one, in the comparison which ClytÃ¦mnestra uses. If there was no such art as that of âstaining bronzeâ (or copper) known at the time, the words would be a natural phrase enough to describe what was represented as an impossibility. Later on in the history of art, however, as in the time of Plutarch, a process so described (perhaps analogous to enamelling) is described (De Pyth. Orac. Â§ 2) as common. If we suppose the art to have been a mystery known to the few, but not to the many, in the time of Ãschylos, then the words would have for the hearers the point of a double entendre. She seems to the mass to disclaim what yet, to those in the secret, she acknowledges. Another rendering refers âbronzeâ to the âsword,â and makes the stains those of blood; as though she said, âI am as guiltless of adultery as of murder,â while yet she knew that she had committed the one, and meant to commit the other. The possibility of such a meaning is certainly in the words and with a sharp-witted audience catching at Ã¦nigmas and dark sayings may have added to their suggestiveness. Such is my vaunt, and being full of truth, Not shameful for a noble wife to speak. The last two lines are by some editors assigned to the Herald. [Exit. Chor. [to Herald.] She hath thus spoken in thy hearing now A goodly word for good interpreters. But tell me, herald, tell of Menelaos, If, coming home again in safety, he Is with you, the dear strength of this our land. Her. I cannot make report of false good news, So that my friends should long rejoice in it. Chor. Ah! could'st thou good news speak, and also true! These things asunder are not well concealed. Her. The chief has vanished from the AchÃ¦an host, He and his ship. I speak no falsehood here. Chor. In sight of all when he from Ilion sailed? Or did a storm's wide evil part him from you? Her. Like skilful archer thou hast hit the mark, And in few words hast told of evil long. Chor. And was it of him as alive or dead The whisper of the other sailors ran? Her. None to that question answer clear can give, Save the Sun-God who feeds the life of earth. Chor. How say'st thou? Did a storm come on our fleet, And do its work through anger of the Gods? Her. It is not meet a day of tidings good To mar with evil news. Apart for each Is special worship. But when courier brings With louring face the ills men pray against, And tells a city that its host has fallen, That for the state there is a general wound, That many a man from many a home is driven, As banned by double scourge that Ares loves, Woe doubly-barbed, Death's two-horsed chariot this. ... When with such griefs as freight a herald comes, 'Tis meet to chant the Erinnyes' dolorous song; But for glad messenger of good deeds wrought That bring deliverance, coming to a town Rejoicing in its triumph, ... how shall I Blend good with evil, telling of a storm That smote the AchÃ¦ans, not without God's wrath? For they a compact swore who erst were foes, Ocean and Fire, and their pledges gave, Wrecking the ill-starred army of the Argives; And in the night rose ill of raging storm: For Thrakian tempests shattered all the ships, Each on the other. Some thus crashed and bruised, By the storm stricken and the surging foam Of wind-tost waves, soon vanished out of sight, Whirled by an evil pilot. And when rose The sun's bright orb, behold, the ÃgÃ¦an sea Blossomed with wrecks of ships and dead AchÃ¦ans. And as for us and our uninjured ship, Surely 'twas some one stole or begged us off, Some God, not man, presiding at the helm; And on our ship with good will Fortune sat, Giver of safety, so that nor in haven Felt we the breakers, nor on rough rock beach Ran we aground. But when we had escaped The hell of waters, then in clear, bright day, Not trusting in our fortune, we in thought O'er new ills brooded of our host destroyed, And eke most roughly handled. And if still Breathe any of them, they report of us As having perished. How else should they speak? And we in our turn deem that they are so. God send good ending! Look you, first and chief, For Menelaos' coming; and indeed, If any sunbeam know of him alive And well, by help of Zeus who has not willed As yet to blot out all the regal race, Some hope there is that he'll come back again. Know, hearing this, that thou the truth hast heard. [Exit Herald. Chor. Stroph. I. Who was it named her with such wondrous truth? (Could it be One unseen, In strange prevision of her destined work, Guiding the tongue through chance?) Who gave that war-wed, strife-upstirring one The name of Helen, ominous of ill? It need hardly be said that it is as difficult to render a paranomasia of this kind as it is to reproduce those, more or less analogous, which we find in the prophets of the Old Testament, (Comp. especially Micah i.;) but it seems better to substitute something which approaches, however imperfectly, to an equivalent than to obscure the reference to the nomen et omen by abandoning the attempt to translate it. âHell of men, and hell of ships, and hell of towers,â has been the rendering adopted by many previous translators. The Greek fondness for this play on names is seen in Sophocles. Aias, v. 401. For great ill as from Hell Brought she on Hellas' men And ships, and Ilion's towers. From bower of gorgeous curtains forth she sailed With breeze of Zephyr Titan-born and strong; Zephyros, Boreas, and the other great winds were represented in the Theogony of Hesiod (v. 134) as the offspring of AstrÃ¦os and EÃ´s, and AstrÃ¦os was a Titan. The west wind was, of course, favourable to Paris as he went with Helen from Greece to TroÃ¯a. And hosts of many men, Hunters that bore the shield, Went on the track of those who steered their boat Unseen to leafy banks of Simois, On her account who came, Dire cause of strife with bloodshed in her train. Antistroph. I. And so the wrath which works its vengeance out Dear bride to Ilion brought, (Ah, all too dear indeed!) exacting still Here again the translator has to meet the difficulty of a pun. As an alternative we might takeâ âTo Ilion brought, well-named, A marriage marring all.â After long lapse of time The penalty of foul dishonour done To friendship's board and Zeus, of host and guest The God, from those who paid Their loud-voiced honour then Unto that bridal strain, That hymeneal chorus which to chant Fell to the lot of all the bridegroom's kin. The sons of Priam are thought of as taking part in the celebration of Helen's marriage with Paris, and as, therefore, involving themselves in the guilt and the penalty of his crime. But learning other song, Priam's ancient city now Bewaileth sore, and calls on Paris' name, Wedded in fatal wedlock; all the time Enduring tear-fraught life For all the blood its citizens had lost. Stroph. II. Yea, once a lion's cub, A mischief in his house, As foster child one reared Here, too, it may be well to give an alternative renderingâ âA mischief in his house, A man reared, not on milk.â Home-reared lions seem to have been common as pets, both among Greeks and Latins, (Arist. Hist. Anim. ix. 31; Plutarch de Cohib. irÃ¢, Â§ 14, p. 822,) sometimes, as in Martial's Epigram, ii. 25, with fatal consequences. The text shows the practice to have been common enough in the time of Pericles to supply a similitude. While still it loved the teats; In life's preluding dawn Tame, by the children loved, And fondled by the old: There may, possibly, be a half allusion here to the passage in the Iliad, (vv. 154â160,) which describes the fascination which the beauty of Helen exercised on the TroÃ¯an elders. Oft in his arms 'twas held, Like infant newly born, With eyes that brightened to the hand that stroked, And fawning at the hest of hunger keen. Antistroph. II. But when full-grown, it showed The nature of its sires; For it unbidden made A feast in recompense Of all their fostering care, By banquet of slain sheep; With blood the house was stained; A curse no slaves could bind, Great mischief murderous: By God's decree a priest of AtÃ¨ thus Was reared, and grew within the man's own house. Stroph. III. So I would tell that thus to Ilion came, Mood as of calm when all the air is still, The gentle pride and joy of kingly state, A tender glance of eye, The full-blown blossom of a passionate love, Thrilling the very soul; And yet she turned aside, And wrought a bitter end of marriage feast, Coming to Priam's race, Ill sojourner, ill friend, Sent by great Zeus, the God of host and guestâ Erinnys, bride-bewailed. Antistroph. III. There lives an old saw, framed in ancient days, The poet becomes a prophet, and asserts what it has been given him to know of the righteous government of God. The dominant creed of Greece at the time was, that the Gods were envious of man's prosperity, that this alone, apart from moral evil, was enough to draw down their wrath, and bring a curse upon the prosperous house. So, e.g., Amasis tells Polycrates (Herod. iii. 40) that the unseen Divinity that rules the world is envious, that power and glory are inevitably the precursors of destruction. Comp. also the speech of Artabanos, (Herod. vii. 10, 46.) Against this, in the tone of one who speaks single-handed for the truth, Ãschylos, through the Chorus, enters his protest. In memories of men, that high estate Full-grown brings forth its young, nor childless dies, But that from good success Springs to the race a woe insatiable. But I, apart from all, Hold this my creed, alone: For impious act it is that offspring breeds, Like to their parent stock: For still in every house That loves the right their fate for evermore Hath issue good and fair. Stroph. IV. But Recklessness of old Is wont to breed another Recklessness, Sporting its youth in human miseries, At once, or whensoe'er the fixed hour comes: This young one, in its turn, Begets Satiety, And Power that none can war with or resist, Daring that Heaven defies,â Two curses dark within their dwelling-place, Like those that gendered them. Antistroph. IV. But Justice shineth bright In dwellings that are dark and dim with smoke, And honours life law-ruled, While gold-decked homes conjoined with hands defiled She with averted eyes Hath left, and draweth near To holier things, nor worships might of wealth, If counterfeit its praise; But still directeth all the course of things Towards its destined end. [Agamemnon is seen approaching in his chariot, followed by another chariot, in which Cassandra is seen standing, carrying her prophet's wand in her hand, and wearing fillets round her temples, and by a great train of soldiers bearing trophies. As they come on the stage the Chorus sings its welcome. Come then, king, thou son of Atreus, Waster of the towers of TroÃ¯a, What of greeting and of homage Shall I give, nor overshooting, Nor falling short of fittest honour? Men there are who, right transgressing, Semblance honour more than being. O'er the sufferer all are ready Wail of bitter grief to utter, Though the piercing pang of sorrow Never to their heart approaches; So with counterfeit rejoicing Men strain faces that are smileless; But whoso his own sheep knoweth, It cannot be men's eyes should 'scape him, Which, of kindly purpose seeming, Fawn with weak and watery fondness. Thou, when thou did'st lead thine army For Helen's sakeâ(I will not hide it)â Wast in my eyes not admirÃ¨d, Painted as by clumsiest artist, Guiding ill the helm of reason, Giving men to death's doom sentenced Courage which their will rejected. Sc. Agamemnon, by the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, had induced his troops to persevere in an expedition from which, in their inmost hearts, they shrank back with strong dislike. Now nor from the spirit's surface, Nor with touch of thought unfriendly, All the toil, I say, is welcome, If men bring it to good issue. And thou soon shalt know, enquiring, Him who rightly, him who wrongly Of thy citizens fulfilleth Task of office for the city. Agam. First Argos, and the Gods who guard the land, 'Tis right to greet; to them in part I owe This my return, and vengeance that I took On Priam's city. Not on hearsay proof Judging the cause, with one consent the Gods Cast in their votes into the urn of blood For Ilion's ruin and her people's death; I'the other urn Hope touched the rim alone, Still far from being filled full. Possibly an allusion to Pandora's box. Here, too, Hope alone was left, but it only came up to where the curve of the rim began, not to its top. The imagery is drawn from the older method of voting, in which (as in Eumenides, v. 678) the votes for condemnation and acquittal were cast into separate urns. And even yet The captured city by its smoke is seen, The incense clouds of AtÃ¨ live on still; And, in the act of dying with its prey, From richest store the dust sends savours sweet. For these things it is meet to give the Gods Thank-offerings long-enduring; for our nets Of vengeance we set close, and for a woman Our Argive monster laid the city low, The lion, as the symbol of the house of Atreus, still seen in the sculptures of MykenÃ¦; the horse, in allusion to the stratagem by which TroÃ¯a had been taken. Foaled by the mare, a people bearing shield, Taking its leap when set the Pleiades; At the end of autumn, and therefore at a season when a storm like that described by the herald would be a probable incident enough. And, bounding o'er the tower, that ravenous lion Lapped up its fill of blood of kingly race. This prelude to the Gods I lengthen out; And as concerns thy purpose (this I well Remember hearing) I with thee agree, And thou in me may'st find an advocate. With but few men is it their natural bent To honour without grudging prosperous friend: For ill-souled envy that the heart besets, Doubles his woe who suffers that disease: He by his own griefs first is overwhelmed, And groans at sight of others' happier lot. And I with good cause say, (for well I know) They are but friendship's mirror, phantom shade, Who seemed to be my most devoted friends. Odysseus only, who against his will So in Sophocles, Philoctetes (v. 1025) taunts Odysseus:â âAnd yet thou sailedst with them by constraint, By tricks fast bound.â Sailed with us, still was found true trace-fellow: And this I say of him or dead or living. But as for all that touches on the Gods, Or on the State, in full assembly we, Calling our council, will deliberate: For what goes well we should with care provide How longest it may last; and where there needs A healing charm, there we with all good will, By surgery or cautery will try To turn away the mischief of disease. And now will I to home and household hearth Move on, and first give thanks unto the Gods Who led me forth, and brought me back again. Since Victory follows, long may she remain! Enter ClytÃ¦mnestra, followed by female attendants carrying purple tapestry. ClytÃ¦m. Ye citizens, ye Argive senators, I will not shrink from telling you the tale Of wife's true love. In time one's shrinking fear Dwindles to nought. Not learning it from others, I will narrate my own unhappy life, The whole long time my lord at Ilion stayed. For first, that wife should sit at home alone Without her husband is a monstrous grief, Hearing full many an ill report of him, Now one and now another coming still, Bringing news home, worse trouble upon bad. Yea, if my lord had met as many wounds As rumour told of, floating to our house, He had been riddled more than any net; And had he died, as tidings still poured in, Then he, a second Geryon Geryon appears in the myth of Hercules as a monster with three heads and three bodies, ruling over the island Erytheia, in the far West, beyond Hesperia. To destroy him and seize his cattle was one of the âtwelve labours,â with which Hesiod (Theogon. vv. 287â294) had already made men familiar. with three lives, Had boasted of a threefold coverlet Of earth above, (I will not say, below him,) When a man is buried, there is earth above and earth below him. ClytÃ¦mnestra having used the word âcoverlet,â pauses to make her language accurate to the very letter. She is speaking only of the earth which would have been laid over her husband's corpse, had he died as often as he was reported to have done. She will not utter anything so ominous as an allusion to the depths below him stretching down to Hades. Dying one death for each of those his forms; And so, because of all these ill reports, Full many a noose around my neck have others Loosed by main force, when I had hung myself. And for this cause no son is with me now, Holding in trust the pledges of our love, As he should be, Orestes. Wonder not; For now a kind ally doth nurture him, Strophios the Phokian, telling me of woes Of twofold aspect, danger on thy side At Ilion, and lest loud-voiced anarchy Should overthrow thy council, since 'tis still The wont of men to kick at those who fall. No trace of guile bears this excuse of mine; As for myself, the fountains of my tears Have flowed till they are dry, no drop remains, And mine eyes suffer from o'er late repose, Watching with tears the beacons set for thee, Orâ âWeeping because the torches in thy house No more were lighted as they were of yore.â Too long untended. And in dreams full oft My slumbers light were startled by the gnat With thin wings buzzing, seeing in the night Ills that stretched far beyond the time of sleep. The words touch upon the psychological fact that in dreams, as in other abnormal states of the mind, the usual measures of time disappear, and we seem to pass through the experiences of many years in the slumber of a few minutes. Now, having borne all this, with mind at ease I hail my Lord as watch-dog of the fold, The stay that saves the ship, of lofty roof Main column-prop, a father's only child, Land that beyond all hope the sailor sees, Morn of great brightness following after storm, Clear-flowing fount to thirsty traveller. The rhetoric of the passage, with all its multiplied similitudes, fine as it is in itself, receives its dramatic significance by being put into the lips of ClytÃ¦mnestra. She âdoth protest too much.â A true wife would have been content with fewer words. Yes, it is pleasant to escape all straits: With words of welcome such as these I greet thee; May jealous Heaven forgive them! for we bore Full many an evil in the past; and now, Dear husband, leave thy car, nor on the ground, O King, set thou the foot that Ilion trampled. Why linger ye, [turning to her attendants,] ye maids, whose task it was To strow the pathway with your tapestries? Let the whole road be straightway purple-strown, That Justice lead to home he looked not for. All else my care, by slumber not subdued, Will justly work as God's will hath decreed. The last three lines of the speech are of course intentionally ambiguous, carrying one meaning to the ear of Agamemnon, and another to that of the audience. (The handmaids advance, and are about to lay the purple carpets on the ground.) Agam. O child of Leda, guardian of my home, Thy speech hath with my absence well agreedâ For long indeed thou mad'st itâbut true praise Is boon that I must seek at other hands. I pray thee, do not in thy woman's fashion Pamper my pride, nor in barbaric guise Prostrate on earth bawl out thy cries to me; Make not my path offensive to the Gods By spreading it with carpets. There is obviously a side-thrust, such as an Athenian audience would catch at, at the token of homage which the Persian kings required of their subjects, the prostration at their feet, the earth spread over with costly robes. Of the latter custom we have examples in the history of Jehu, (2 Kings ix. 13,) in our Lord's entry into Jerusalem, (Mark xi. 8,) in the usages of modern Persian kings, (Malcolm's Persia, i. 580;) perhaps also in the true rendering of Ps. xlv. 14, âShe shall be brought unto the king on raiment of needle-work.â In the march of Xerxes across the Hellespont myrtle-boughs strown on the bridge of boats took the place of robes, (Herod. vii. 54.) To the Greek character, with its strong love of independence, such customs were hateful. The case of Pausanias, who offended the national feeling by assuming the outward state of the Persian kings, must have been recalled to the minds of the Athenians, intentionally or otherwise, by such a passage as this. They alone May claim that honour; but for mortal men To walk on fair embroidery, to me Seems nowise without peril. So I bid you To honour me as man, and not as God. Apart from all foot-mats and tapestry My fame speaks loudly; and God's greatest gift Is not to err from wisdom. We must bless Him only who ends life in fair estate. The âold saying, famed of many men,â which we find in the TrachiniÃ¦ of Sophocles, (v. 1,) and in the counsel of Solon to CrÅsos, (Herod. i. 32.) Should I thus act throughout, good hope were mine. ClytÃ¦m. Nay, say not this to thwart my purposes. Agam. Know that I change not for the worse my purpose. ClytÃ¦m. In fear, perchance, thou vowÃ¨d'st thus to act. Agam. If any, I, with fullest knowledge spake. He who had suffered so much from the wrath of Artemis at Aulis knew what it was to rouse the wrath and jealousy of the Gods. ClytÃ¦m. What think'st thou Priam, had he wrought such deeds. ...? Agam. Full gladly he, I trow, had trod on carpets. ClytÃ¦m. Then shrink not thou through fear of men's dispraise. Agam. A people's muttered whisper works with strength. An echo of a line in Hesiod, (Works and Days, 763)â âNo whispered rumours which the many spread Can ever wholly perish.â ClytÃ¦m. Who is not envied is not enviable. Agam. 'Tis not a woman's part to crave for strife. ClytÃ¦m. True, yet the prosperous e'en should sometimes yield. Agam. Dost thou then value victory in this strife? ClytÃ¦m. Nay, hearken! Give me sway at least in this. Agam. Well, then, if thou wilt have it so, with speed Let some one loose my buskins, Here, too, we may trace a reference to the Oriental custom of recognising the sanctity of a consecrated place by taking the shoes from off the feet, as in Exod. iii. 5, in the services of the Tabernacle and Temple, through all their history, (Juven. Sat. vi. 159,) in all mosques to the present day. Agamemnon, yielding to the temptress, seeks to make a compromise with his conscience. He will walk upon the tapestry, but will treat it as if it, of right, belonged to the Gods, and were a consecrated thing. It is probably in connexion with this incident that Ãschylos was said to have been the first to bring actors on the stage in these boots or buskins, (Suidas. s. v. ??????.) (servants they Doing the foot's true work,) and as I tread Upon these robes sea-purpled, may no wrath From glance of Gods smite on me from afar! Great shame I feel to trample with my foot This wealth of carpets, costliest work of looms; So far for this. This stranger [pointing to Cassandra] lead thou in With kindliness. On him who gently wields His power God's eye looks kindly from afar. None of their own will choose a bond-slave's life; And she, the chosen flower of many spoils, Has followed with me as the army's gift. But since I turn, obeying thee in this, I'll to my palace go, on purple treading. ClytÃ¦m. There is a sea,âand who shall drain it dry? Producing still new store of purple juice, Precious as silver, staining many a robe. And in our house, with God's help, O my king, 'Tis ours to boast our palace knows no stint. Trampling of many robes would I have vowed, Had that been ordered me in oracles, When for my lord's return I then did plan My votive gifts. For while the root lives on, The foliage stretches even to the house, And spreads its shade against the dog-star's rage; So when thou comest to thy hearth and home, Thou show'st the warmth that comes in winter time; And when from unripe clusters Zeus matures The wine, The words of Isaiah, (xviii. 5,) âwhen the sour grape is ripening in the flower,â present an almost verbal parallel. then is there coolness in the house, If the true master dwelleth in his home. Ah, Zeus! the All-worker, Zeus, work out for me All that I pray for; let it be thy care To look to what Thou purposest to work. The ever-recurring ambiguity of ClytÃ¦mnestra's language is again traceable, as is also her fondness for rhetorical similitudes. [Exeunt Agamemnon, walking on the tapestry, ClytÃ¦mnestra, and her attendants. Chor. Stroph. I. Why thus continually Do haunting phantoms hover at the gate Of my foreboding heart? Why floats prophetic song, unbought, unbidden? Why doth no steadfast trust Sit on my mind's dear throne, To fling it from me as a vision dim? Long time hath passed since stern-ropes of our ships Were fastened on the sand, when our great host Of those that sailed in ships Had come to Ilion's towers. The Chorus speaks in perplexity. It cannot get rid of its forebodings, and yet it would seem as if the time for the fulfilment of the dark words of Calchas must have passed long since. It actually sees the safe return of the leader of the host, yet still its fears haunt it. Antistroph. I. And now from these mine eyes I learn, myself reporting to myself, Their safe return; and yet My mind within itself, taught by itself, Chanteth Erinnys' dirge, The lyreless melody, And hath no strength of wonted confidence. Not vain these inner pulses, as my heart Whirls eddying in breast oracular. I, against hope, will pray It prove false oracle. Stroph. II. Of high, o'erflowing health There is no limit fixed that satisfies; For evermore disease, as neighbour close Whom but a wall divides, Upon it presses; and man's prosperous state Moves on its course, and strikes Upon an unseen rock; But if his fear for safety of his freight, A part, from well-poised sling, shall sacrifice, Then the whole house sinks not, O'erfilled with wretchedness, Nor does he swamp the boat: So, too, abundant gift From Zeus in bounteous fulness, and the fruit Of glebe at harvest tide Have caused to cease sore hunger's pestilence; Antistroph. II. But blood that once hath flowed In purple stains of death upon the ground At a man's feet, who then can bid it back By any charm of song? Else him who knew to call the dead to life Asclepios, whom Zeus smote with his thunderbolt for having restored Hippolytos to life. Zeus had not sternly checked, As warning unto all; But unless Fate, firm-fixed, had barred our fate From any chance of succour from the Gods, Then had my heart poured forth Its thoughts, outstripping speech. The Chorus, in spite of their suspicions and forebodings, have given the king no warning. They excuse themselves by the plea of necessity, the sovereign decree of Zeus overruling all man's attempts to withstand it. But now in gloom it wails Sore vexed, with little hope At any time hereafter fitting end To find, unravelling, My soul within me burning with hot thoughts. Re-enter ClytÃ¦mnestra. ClytÃ¦m. [to Cassandra, who has remained in the chariot during the choral ode.] Thou tooâI mean Cassandraâgo within; Since Zeus hath made it thine, and not in wrath, To share the lustral waters in our house, Standing with many a slave the altar nigh Of Zeus, who guards our goods. Cassandra is summoned to an act of worship. The household is gathered, the altar to Zeus Ktesios, (the God of the family property,) standing in the servants' hall, is ready. The new slave must come in and take her place with the others. Now get thee down From out this car, and be not over proud. They say that e'en Alcmena's son endured As in the story which forms the groundwork of the TrachiniÃ¦ of Sophocles, vv. 250-280, that Heracles had been sold to Omphale as a slave, in penalty for the murder of Iphitos. Being sold a slave, constrained to bear the yoke: And if the doom of this ill chance is thine, Great gain it is to meet with lords who own Ancestral wealth. But whoso reap full crops They never dared to hope for, these in all, And beyond measure, to their slaves are harsh: Political as well as dramatic. The Eupatrid poet appeals to public opinion against the nouveaux riches, the tanners and lamp-makers, who were already beginning to push themselves forward towards prominence and power. The way was thus prepared in the first play of the Trilogy for what is known to have been the main object of the last. From us thou hast whate'er is customary. Chor. So ends she, speaking words full clear to thee, And seeing thou art in the toils of fate, If thou obey, thou wilt obey; and yet, Perchance, obey thou wilt not. ClytÃ¦m. Nay, but unless she, like a swallow, speaks A barbarous tongue unknown, I, speaking now Within her apprehension, must persuade. Chor. [to Cassandra.] Go with her. What she bids is now the best; Obey her: leave thy seat upon this car. ClytÃ¦m. I have no leisure here to stay without: For as regards our central altar, there The sheep stand by as victims for the fire; For never had we hoped such thanks to give: If thou wilt do this, make no more delay; But if thou understandest not my words, Then wave thy foreign hand in lieu of speech. [Cassandra shudders as in horror, but makes no sign. Chor. The stranger seems a clear interpreter To need. Her look is like a captured deer's. ClytÃ¦m. Nay, she is mad, and follows evil thoughts, Since, leaving now her city newly-captured, She comes, and knows not how to take the curb, Ere she foam out her passion in her blood. I will not, uttering more, be put to shame. [Exit. Chor. And I, as pitying her, will not be wroth: Come, thou poor sufferer, empty leave thy car; Yield to thy doom, and handsel now the yoke. [Cassandra leaves the chariot, and bursts into a cry of wailing. Stroph. I. Cass. Woe! woe, and well-a-day! Apollo! O Apollo! Chor. Why criest thou so loud on Loxias? The wailing cry of mourner suits not him. Antistroph. I. Cass. Woe! woe, and well-a-day! Apollo! O Apollo! Chor. Again with boding words she calls the God, Though all unmeet as helper to men's groans. Stroph. II. Cass. Apollo! O Apollo! God of all paths, Apollo true to me; With might appalling thou again destroy'st me. Here again the translator has the task of finding an English paronomasia which approximates to that of the Greek, between Apollo and ???????, the destroyer. To Apollo, as the God of paths, (Aguieus,) an altar stood, column-fashion, before the street-door of every house, and to such an altar, placed by the door of Agamemnon's palace, Cassandra turns, with the twofold play upon the name. Chor. She seems her own ills like to prophecy: The God's great gift is in the slave's mind yet. Antistroph. II. Cass. Apollo! O Apollo! God of all paths, Apollo true to me; What path hast led me? To what roof hast brought? Chor. To that of the AtreidÃ¦. This I tell, If thou know'st not. Thou wilt not find it false. Stroph. III. Cass. Ah! Ah! Ah me! Say rather to a house God hatesâthat knows Murder, self-slaughter, ropes, This refers, probably, to the death of Hippodameia, the wife of Pelops, who killed herself, in remorse for the death of Chrysippos, or fear of her husband's anger. The horrors of the royal house of Argos pass, one by one, before the vision of the prophetess, and this leads the procession, followed by the spectres of the murdered children of Thyestes. A human shamble staining earth with blood. Chor. Keen scented seems this stranger, like a hound, And searches out whose slaughter she shall find. Antistroph. III. Cass. Ah! Ah! Ah me! Lo! [looking wildly, and pointing upward,] there the witnesses whose word I trust,â Those babes who wail their death, The roasted flesh that made a father's meal. Chor. We of a truth had heard thy seeress fame, But prophets now are not the race we seek. Stroph. IV. Cass. Ah me! Oh horror! What ill schemes she now? What is this new great woe? Great evil plots she in this very house, Hard for its friends to bear, immedicable; And help stands far aloof. Chor. These oracles of thine surpass my ken; Those I know well. The whole town rings with them. The Chorus understands the vision of the clairvoyante as regards the past tragedy of the house of Atreus, but not that which seems to portend another actually imminent. Antistroph. IV. Cass. Ah me! O daring one! what work'st thou here, Who having cleansed and cheered Thy helpmate, then ... How shall I tell the end? For quick it comes, and hand is following hand, Stretched out to strike the blow. Chor. Still I discern not; after riddles dark I am perplexed with thy dim oracles. Stroph. V. Cass. Ah, horror, horror! What is this I see? Is it a snare of Hell? Nay, the true net is she who shares his bed, Who shares in working death. Ha! let the Band insatiable in hate Fresh visions come before the eyes of the seeress. She beholds the company of Erinnyes hovering over the accursed house, and calls on them to continue their work till the new crime has met with its due punishment. Howl for the race its wild exulting cry O'er sacrifice that calls For storm of many stones. Stroph. VI. Chor. What dire Erinnys bidd'st thou o'er our house To raise shrill cry? Thy speech but little cheers; And to my heart there rush Blood-drops of saffron hue, The âyellowâ look of fear is thought of as being caused by an actual change in the colour of the blood as it flows through the veins to the heart. Which, when from deadly wound They fall, together with life's setting rays End, as it fails, their own appointed course: And mischief comes apace. Antistroph. V. Cass. See, see, I say, from that fell heifer there Keep thou the bull: Here there is prevision as well as clairvoyance. The deed is not yet done. The sacrifice and the feast are still going on, yet she sees the crime in all its circumstances. in robes Entangling him, she with her weapon gores Him with the swarthy horns, As before (v. 115) the black eagle had been the symbol of the warriorchief, so here the black-horned bull, that being one of the notes of the best breed of cattle. A various reading gives âwith her swarthy horn.â Lo! in that tub with water filled he falls, Smitten to death, and I to thee set forth Crime of a bath of blood, By subtlest guile devised. Antistroph. VI. Chor. I will not boast that I keen insight have In words oracular; yet bode I ill. What good bring oracles To mortal men? These arts, In days of evils sore, with many words, Bring but a vague, dim fear oracular For men to learn and know. Stroph. VII. Cass. Woe, woe! for all sore ills that fall on me! It is my grief thou speak'st of, blending it With his. [Pausing, and then crying out.] Ah! wherefore then Hast thou The ecstasy of horror interrupts the tenor of her speech, and the second âthouâ is addressed not to the chorus, but to Agamemnon, whose death Cassandra has just witnessed in her vision. thus brought me here, For nought but death with thee? What other doom is mine? Stroph. VIII. Chor. Frenzied art thou, and by some God's might swayed, And utterest for thyself A melody which is no melody, Like to that tawny one, Insatiate in her wail, The nightingale, who still with sorrowing soul, And âItys, Itys,â cry, The song of the nightingale, represented by these sounds, was connected with a long legend, specially Attic in its origin. Philomela, daughter of Pandion, king of Attica, suffered outrage at the hands of Tereus, who was married to her sister Procne, and was then changed into a nightingale, destined ever to lament the fate of Itys, her sister's son. The earliest form of the story appears in the Odyssey, (xix. 518.) Comp. Sophocles, Electr. v. 148. Bemoans a life o'erflourishing in ills. Antistroph. VII. Cass. Ah, for the doom of clear-voiced nightingale! The Gods gave her a body bearing wings, And life of pleasant days With no fresh cause to weep; But for me waiteth still Stroke from the two-edged sword. Antistroph. VIII. Chor. From what source hast thou these dread agonies Sent on thee by thy God, Yet vague and little meaning; and thy cries Dire with ill-omened shrieks Dost utter as a chant, And blendest with them strains of shrillest grief? Whence treadest thou this track Of evil-boding path of prophecy? Stroph. IX. Cass. Woe for the marriage-ties, the marriage-ties Of Paris that brought ruin on his friends! Woe for my native stream, Scamandros, that I loved! Once on thy banks my maiden youth was reared, (Ah, miserable me!) Now by Cokytos and by Acheron's shores I seem too likely soon to utter song Of wild, prophetic speech. Stroph. X. Chor. What hast thou spoken now With utterance all too clear? Even a boy its gist might understand; I to the quick am pierced With throe of deadly pain, Whilst thou thy moaning cries art uttering Over thy sore mischance, Wondrous for me to hear. Antistroph. IX. Cass. Woe for the toil and trouble, toil and trouble Of city that is utterly destroyed! Woe for the victims slain Of herds that roamed the fields, My father's sacrifice to save his towers! No healing charm they brought To save the city from its present doom: And I with hot thoughts wild myself shall throw Full soon upon the ground. Antistroph. X. Chor. This that thou utterest now With all before agrees. What Power above dooms thee with purpose ill, Down-swooping from on high, To utter with thy voice Sorrows of deepest woe, and bringing death? And what the end shall be Perplexes in the extreme. Cass. Nay, now no more from out of maiden veils My oracle shall glance, like bride fresh wed; In the marriage-rites of the Greeks of the time of Ãschylos, the bride for three days after the wedding wore her veil; then, as now no longer shrinking from her matron life, she laid it aside and looked on her husband with unveiled face. But seems as though 'twould rush with speedy gales In full, clear brightness to the morning dawn; So that a greater woe than this shall surge Like wave against the sunlight. The picture might be drawn by any artist of power, but we may, perhaps, trace a reproduction of one of the grandest passages in the Iliad, (iv. 422â426.) Now I'll teach No more in parables. Bear witness ye, As running with me, that I scent the track Of evil deeds that long ago were wrought: For never are they absent from this house, That choral band which chants with one accord, Yet no good music; good is not their theme. And now, as having drunk men's blood, So in the Eumenides, (v. 293,) the Erinnyes appear as vampires, drinking the blood of their victims. and so Grown wilder, bolder, see, the revelling band, Erinnyes of the race, still haunt the halls, Not easy to dismiss. And so they sing, Close cleaving to the house, its primal woe, The death of Myrtilos as the first crime in the long history of the house of Pelops. Comp. Soph. Electr. v. 470. The âdefilerâ is Thyestes, who seduced Aerope, the wife of Atreus. And vent their loathing in alternate strains On marriage-bed of brother ruthless found To that defiler. Miss I now, or hit Like archer skilled? or am I seeress false, A babbler vain that knocks at every door? Yes, swear beforehand, ere I die, I know (And not by rumour only) all the sins Of ancient days that haunt and vex this house. Chor. How could an oath, how firm soe'er confirmed, Bring aught of healing? Lo, I marvel at thee, That thou, though born afar beyond the sea, Should'st tell an alien city's tale as clear As though thyself had'st stood by all the while. Cass. The seer Apollo set me to this task. Chor. Was he, a God, so smitten with desire? Cass. There was a time when shame restrained my speech. Chor. True; they who prosper still are shy and coy. Cass. He wrestled hard, breathing hot love on me. Chor. And were ye one indeed whence children spring? Cass. I cheated Loxias with a feigned consent. Chor. Wast thou e'en then possessed with arts divine? Cass. E'en then my country's woes I prophesied. Chor. How wast thou then unscathed by Loxias' wrath? Cass. I for that fault with no man gained belief. Chor. To us, at least, thou seem'st to speak the truth. Cass. [Again speaking wildly as in an ecstasy.] Ah, woe is me! Woe's me! Oh, ills on ills! Again the dread pang of true prophet's gift With foretaste of great evil dizzies me. See ye those children sitting on the house In fashion like to phantom forms of dreams? Infants who perished at their own kin's hands, Their palms filled full with meat of their own flesh, Loom on my sight, the heart and entrails bearing, (A sorry burden that!) on which of old Their father fed. The horror of the Thyestes banquet again haunts her as the source of all the evils that followed, of the deaths both of Iphigeneia and Agamemnon. And in revenge for this, I say a lion, dwelling in his lair, With not a spark of courage, stay-at-home, Plots 'gainst my master now he's home returned, (Yes mineâfor still I must the slave's yoke bear;) And the ships' ruler, Ilion's conqueror, Knows not what things the tongue of that lewd bitch Has spoken and spun out in welcome smooth, And, like a secret AtÃ¨, will work out With dire success: thus 'tis she plans: the male Is murdered by the female. By what name Shall I that loathÃ¨d monster rightly call? An AmphisbÃ¦na? or a Skylla dwelling Both words point to the Sindbad-like stories of distant marvels brought back by Greek sailors. The AmphisbÃ¦na, (double-goer,) wriggling itself backward and forward, believed to have a head at each extremity, was looked upon as at once the most subtle and the most venomous of serpents. Skylla, already famous in its mythical form from the story in the Odyssey. (xii. 85â100,) was probably a âdevelopmentâ of the monstrous cuttle-fish of the straits of Messina. Among the rocks, the sailors' enemy? Hades' fierce raging mother, breathing out Against her friends a curse implacable? Ah, how she raised her cry, (oh, daring one!) As in the rout of battle, and she feigns To hail with joy her lord's return in safety! And if thou dost not credit this, what then? What will be will. Soon, present, pitying me Thou'lt own I am too true a prophetess. Chor. Thyestes' banquet on his children's flesh I know and shudder at; and fear o'ercomes me, Hearing not counterfeits of fact, but truths; Yet in the rest I hear and miss my path. Cass. I say thou'lt witness Agamemnon's death. Chor. Hush, wretched woman, close those lips of thine! Cass. For this my speech no healing God's at hand. Chor. True, if it must be, but may God avert it! Cass. Thou utterest prayers, but others murder plot. Chor. And by what man is this woe brought to pass? Cass. Sure, thou hast seen my bodings all amiss. Chor. I see not his device who works the deed. Cass. And yet I know the Hellenic tongue right well. Chor. So does the Pythian, yet her words are hard. Cass. [In another access of frenzy.] Ah me, this fire! It comes upon me now! Ah me, Apollo, wolf-slayer! woe is me! This biped lioness who takes to bed A wolf in absence of the noble lion, Will slay me, wretched me. And, as one Mixing a poisoned draught, she boasts that she Will put my price into her cup of wrath, Sharpening her sword to smite her spouse with death, So paying him for bringing me. Oh, why Do I still wear what all men flout and scorn, My wand and seeress-wreaths around my neck? As in Homer (Il. i. 14) so here, the servant of Apollo bears the wand of augury, and fillets or wreaths round head and arms. The divining garments, in like manner, were of white linen. Thee, ere myself I die, I will destroy: [breaks her wand.] Perish ye thus; [casting off her wreaths,] I soon shall follow you: Make rich another AtÃ¨ If we adopt this reading, we must think of Cassandra as identifying herself with the woe (AtÃ¨) which makes up her life, just as afterwards ClytÃ¦mnestra speaks of herself as one with the avenging Demon (Alastor) of the house of Atreus, (1478.) The alternative reading gives,â âMake rich in woe another in my place.â in my place; Behold Apollo's self is stripping me Of my divining garments, and that too, When he has seen me even in this garb Scorned without cause among my friends and kin, By foes, with no diversity of mood. Reviled as vagrant, wandering prophetess, Poor, wretched, famished, I endured to live. And now the Seer who me a seeress made Hath brought me to this lot of deadly doom. Now for my father's altar there awaits me A butcher's block where I am smitten down By slaughtering stroke, and with hot gush of blood. But the Gods will not slight us when we're dead; Another yet shall come as champion for us, A son who slays his mother, to avenge His father; and the exiled wanderer Far from his home, shall one day come again, Upon these woes to set the coping-stone: For the high Gods have sworn a mighty oath, His father's fall, laid low, shall bring him back. Why then do I thus groan in this new home, Perhaps âin home not mine.â When, to begin with, Ilion's town I saw Faring as it did fare, and they who held That town are gone by judgment of the Gods? I too will fare as they, and venture death: So I these gates of Hades now address, And pray for blow that bringeth death at once, That so with no fierce spasm, while the blood Flows in calm death, I then may close mine eyes. [Goes towards the door of the palace. Chor. O thou most wretched, yet again most wise; Long hast thou spoken, lady, but if well Thou know'st thy doom, why to the altar go'st thou, Like heifer driven of God, so confidently? When the victim, instead of shrinking and struggling, went, as with good courage, to the altar, it was noted as a sign of a divine impulse. Such a strange, new courage the Chorus notes in Cassandra. Cass. For me, my friends, there is no time to 'scape. Chor. Yea; but he gains in time who comes the last. Cass. The day is come: small gain for me in flight. Chor. Know then thou sufferest with a heart full brave. Cass. Such words as these the prosperous never hear. Chor. Yet mortal man may welcome glorious death. Cass. [Shrinking back from opening the door.] Woe's me for thee and thy brave sons, my father! Chor. What cometh now? What fear oppresseth thee? Cass. [Again going to the door and then shuddering in another burst of frenzy.] Fie on't, fie! Chor. Whence comes this âFie?â unless from mind that loathes? Cass. The house is tainted with the scent of death. Chor. How so? This smells of victims on the hearth. Cass. Nay, it is like the blast from out a grave. Chor. No Syrian ritual tell'st thou for our house. Cass. Well then I go, and e'en within will wail My fate and Agamemnon's. And for me, Enough of life. Ah, friends! Ah! not for nought I shrink in fear, as bird shrinks from the brake. When I am dead do ye this witness bear, When in revenge for me, a woman, Death A woman smites, and man shall fall for man In evil wedlock wed. This kindly act, As one about to die, I pray you do me. Chor. Thy doom foretold, poor sufferer, moves my pity. Cass. I fain would speak once more, yet not to wail Mine own death-song; but to the Sun I pray, To his last rays, that my avengers wreak Upon my hated murderers judgment due For me, who die a slave's death, easy prey. Ah, life of man! when most it prospereth, It is but limned in outline; and when brought To low estate, then doth the sponge, full soaked, Wipe out the picture with its frequent touch: And this I count more piteous e'en than that. Her own doom, hard as it was, touches her less than the common lot of human suffering and mutability. [Passes through the door into the palace. Chor. 'Tis true of all men that they never set A limit to good fortune; none doth say, As bidding it depart, And warding it from palaces of pride, âCome thou no longer here.â To this our lord the Blest Ones gave to take Priam's city; and he comes Safe to his home and honoured by the Gods; But if he now shall pay The forfeit of blood-guiltiness of old, And, dying, so work out for those who died, By his own death another penalty, Who then of mortal men, Hearing such things as this, Can boast that he was born With fate from evil free? Agam. [from within.] Ah, me! I am struck down with deadly stroke. Chor. Hush! Who cries out with deadly stroke sore smitten? Agam. Ah me, again! struck down a second time! Chor. By the king's groans I judge the deed is done; But let us now confer for counsels safe. So far the dialogue has been sustained by the CoryphÃ¦os, or leader of the Chorus. Now each member of it speaks and gives his counsel. Chor. a. I give you my advice to summon here, Here, to the palace, all the citizens. Chor. b. I think it best to rush at once on them, And take them in the act with sword yet wet. Chor. c. And I too give like counsel, and I vote For doing something. 'Tis no time to pause. Chor. d. Who will see, may.âThey but the prelude work Of tyranny usurped o'er all the state. Chor. e. Yes, we are slow, but they who trample down The grace of hesitation slumber not. Chor. f. I know not what advice to find or speak: He who can act knows how to counsel too. Chor. g. I too think with thee; for I have no hope With words to raise the dead again to life. Chor. h. What! Shall we drag our life on and submit To these usurpers that defile the house? Chor. i. Nay, that we cannot bear: To die were better; For death is gentler far than tyranny. Chor. k. Shall we upon this evidence of groans Guess, as divining that our lord is dead? Chor. l. When we know clearly, then should we discuss: To guess is one thing, and to know another. Chor. So vote I too, and on the winning side, Taking the votes all round, that we should learn How he, the son of Atreus, fareth now. The CoryphÃ¦os again takes up his part, sums up, and pronounces his decision. Enter ClytÃ¦mnestra from the palace, followed by soldiers and attendants. The open doors show the corpses of Agamemnon and Cassandra, the former lying in a silvered bath. ClytÃ¦m. Though many words before to suit the time Were spoken, now I shall not be ashamed The contrary to utter: How could one By open show of enmity to foes Who seemed as friends, fence in the snares of death Too high to be o'erleapt? But as for me, Not without forethought for this long time past, This conflict comes to me from triumph old i.e. He had had his triumph over her when, forgetful of her mother's feelings, he had sacrificed Iphigeneia. She has now repaid him to the full. Of his, though slowly wrought. I stand where I Did smite him down, with all my task well done. So did I it, (the deed deny I not,) That he could nor avert his doom nor flee: I cast around him drag-net as for fish, With not one outlet, evil wealth of robe: And twice I smote him, and with two deep groans He dropped his limbs: And when he thus fell down I gave him yet a third, thank-offering true The third libation at all feasts was to Zeus, as the Preserver or Guardian Deity. ClytÃ¦mnestra boasts that her third blow was as an offering to a God of other kind, to Him who had in his keeping not the living, but the dead. To Hades of the dark, who guards the dead. So fallen he gasps out his struggling soul, And breathing forth a sharp, quick gush of blood, He showers dark drops of gory rain on me, Who no less joy felt in them than the corn, When the blade bears, in glad shower given of God. Since this is so, ye Argive elders here, Ye, if ye will, may acquiesce, but I Exult. And were it fitting now to pour Libation o'er the dead, So in the ChoÃ«phori, (vv. 351, 476,) the custom of pouring libations on the burial-place of the dead is recognised as an element of their blessedness or shame in Hades, and Agamemnon is represented as lacking the honour which comes from them till he receives it at the hand of Orestes. 'twere justly done, Yea, more than justly; such a goblet full Of ills hath he filled up with curses dire At home, and now has come to drain it off. Chor. We marvel at the boldness of thy tongue, Who o'er thy husband's corpse speak'st vaunt like this. ClytÃ¦m. Ye test me as a woman weak of mind; But I with dauntless heart to you that know Say this, and whether thou dost praise or blame, Is all alike:âhere Agamemnon lies, My husband, now a corpse, of this right hand, As artist just, the handiwork: so stands it. Strophe. Chor. What evil thing, O Queen, or reared on earth, Or draught from salt sea-wave Hast thou fed on, to bring Such incense on thyself, Incense was placed on the head of the victim. The Chorus tells ClytÃ¦mnestra that she has brought upon her own head the incense, not of praise and admiration, but of hatred and wrath, as though some poison had driven her mad. And so did'st set at nought A people's loud-voiced curse? Yes, thou hast stricken him down, And shalt an exile be, Hated with strong hate of the citizens. ClytÃ¦m. Ha! now on me thou lay'st the exile's doom, My subjects' hate, and people's loud-voiced curse, Though ne'er did'st thou oppose my husband there, Who, with no more regard than had been due To a brute creature, though he called his own Full many a fleecy sheep in pastures bred, Yet sacrificed his child, the dear-loved fruit Of all my travail-pangs, to be a charm Against the winds of Thrakia. Should'st thou not Have banished him from out this land of ours, As meed for all his crimes? Yet hearing now My deeds, thou art a judge full stern. But I Tell thee to speak thy threats, as knowing well I am prepared that thou on equal terms Should'st rule, if thou dost conquer. But if God Should otherwise decree, then thou shalt learn, Late though it be, the lesson to be wise. Chor. Antistrophe. Yea, thou art stout of heart, and speak'st big words; And maddened is thy soul As by a murderous hate; And still upon thy brow, Is seen, not yet avenged, The stain of blood-spot foul; And yet it needs must be, One day thou, reft of friends, Shalt pay the penalty of blow for blow. Clytem. Now hear thou too my oaths of solemn awe: By my accomplished vengeance for my child, By AtÃ¨ and Erinnys, unto whom I slew him as a victim, I look not That fear should come beneath this roof of mine, So long as on my hearth Ãgisthos kindles The flaming fire, as well disposed to me As he hath been aforetime. He to us Is no slight shield of stoutest confidence. There lies he, [pointing to the corpse of Agamemnon,] one who foully wronged his wife, The darling of the ChryseÃ¯ds at TroÃ¯a; And there [pointing to Cassandra] this captive slave, this auguress, His concubine, this seeress trustworthy, Who shared his bed, and yet was as well known To the sailors as their benches! ... They have fared Not otherwise than they deserved: for he Lies as you see. And she who, like a swan, The species of swan referred to is said to be the Cygnus Musicus. Aristotle (Hist. Anim., ix. 12) describes swans of some kind as having been heard by sailors near the coast of Libya, âsinging with a lamentable cry.â Mrs Somerville (Phys. Geog., c. xxxiii. 3) describes their note as âlike that of a violin.â The same fact is reported of the swans of Iceland and other regions of the far North. The strange, tender beauty of the passage in the PhÅdo of Plato, (p. 85, a,) which speaks of them as singing when at the point of death, has done more than anything else to make the illustration one of the commonplaces of rhetoric and poetry. Has chanted out her last and dying song, Lies, loved by him, and so to me has brought A zest to give my bed a fresh delight. Chor. Stroph. I. The structure of the lyrical dialogue that follows is somewhat complicated, and different editors have adopted different arrangements. I have followed Paley's. Ah me, would death might come Quickly, with no sharp throe of agony, Nor long bed-ridden pain, Bringing the endless sleep; Since he, the watchman most benign of all, Hath now been smitten low, Who by a woman's means hath much endured, And at a woman's hand hath lost his life! Stroph. II. Alas! alas! O Helen, evil-souled, Who, though but one, hast slain Many, yea, very many lives at TroÃ¯a. Several lines seem to have dropped out by some accident of transcripttion. Stroph. III. But now for blood that may not be washed out Thou hast to full bloom brought A deed of guilt that no man may forget, For strife was in the house, Wrought out in fullest strength, Woe for a husband's life. ClytÃ¦m. Stroph. IV. Nay, pray not thou for destiny of death, Being grieved with what thou see'st; Nor turn thou against Helena thy wrath, As though she murderess were, And, though but one, had many DanaÃ¯'s souls Brought low in death, and wrought o'erwhelming woe. Chor. Antistroph. I. O Power that dost attack Our palace and the two TantalidÃ¦, Agamemnon and Menelaos, as descended from Tantalos. Who rul'st through women's souls, With sway that grieves my heart! See, o'er the body, like a raven foul, Against all laws of right, Standing, she boasteth in her pride of heart That she can chant her pÃ¦an hymn of praise. ClytÃ¦m. Antistroph. IV. Now thou dost guide aright thy speech and thought, Invoking that dread Power, The thrice-gorged evil genius of this house; For he it is who feeds In the heart's depth the raging lust of blood: Ere the old wound is healed, new bloodshed comes. Chor. Stroph. V. Yes, of a Power thou tell'st Mighty and very wrathful to this house: Ah, me! Ah, me! an evil tale enough Of baleful chance of doom, Insatiable of ill: Yet, ah! it is through Zeus, The all-appointing and all-working One; For what with mortal men Is wrought apart from Zeus? What of all this is not by God decreed? Stroph. VI. Ah, me! Ah, me! My king, my king, how shall I weep for thee? What shall I speak from heart that truly loves? And now thou lie'st there, breathing out thy life, In this fell spider's web,â Stroph. VII. (Yes, woe is me, woe, woe! Woe for this couch of thine dishonourable!)â Slain by a subtle death, With sword two-edged which her right hand did wield. ClytÃ¦m. Stroph. VIII. Thou say'st the deed is mine; Yet think thou not of me, As Agamemnon's spouse; But in the semblance of this dead man's wife, The old and keen Avenger of the house Of Atreus, that cruel banqueter of old, Hath wrought out vengeance full On him who lieth here, And full-grown victim slain Over the younger victims of the past. ClytÃ¦mnestra still harps (though in ambiguous words, which may refer also to the murder of the children of Thyestes) upon the death of Iphigeneia as the crime which it had been her work to avenge. Chor. Antistroph. V. That thou art guiltless found Of this foul murder who will witness bear? How can it be so, how? And yet, perchance, As helper to the deed The avenging Fiend might come Of that ancestral time; And by this rush of murders of near kin Dark Ares presses on, Where he will vengeance work For clotted gore of children foully eaten. Antistroph. VI. Ah me! Ah me! My king, my king, how shall I weep for thee? What shall I speak from heart that truly loves? And now thou liest there, breathing out thy life, In this fell spider's web, Antistroph. VII. (Yes, woe is me! woe! woe! Woe for this couch of thine dishonourable!) Slain by a subtle death, With sword two-edged which her right hand did wield. ClytÃ¦m. Antistroph. VIII. Nay, not dishonourable His death doth seem to me: Did he not work a doom, In this our house with guile? Perhaps, âAnd that too, not a slaves.â Mine own dear child, begotten of this man, Iphigeneia, wept with many a tear, He foully slew; now foully slain himself, Let him not boast in Hell, Since he the forfeit pays, Pierced by the sword in death, For all the evil that his hand hath wrought. Chor. Stroph. IX. I stand perplexed in soul, deprived of power Of quick and ready thought, Where now to turn, since thus Our home is falling low. I fear the pelting storm Of blood that shakes the basement of the house. No more it rains in drops: And for another deed of mischief dire, Fate whets the righteous doom On other whetstones still. Antistroph. II. O Earth! O Earth! Oh, would thou had'st received me, Ere I saw him on couch Of bath with silvered walls thus stretched in death! Who now will bury, who bewail? Wilt thou, When thou hast slain thy husband, mourn his death, And for thy monstrous deeds Do graceless grace? And who will chant the dirge With tears in truth of heart, Over our godlike chief? ClytÃ¦m. Stroph. X. It is not thine to speak; 'Twas at our hands he fell, Yea, he fell low in death, And we will bury him, Not with the bitter tears of those who weep As inmates of the house; But she, his child, Iphigeneia, there Shall meet her father, and with greeting kind, E'en as is fit, by that swift-flowing ford, Dark stream of bitter woes, Shall clasp him in her arms, And give a daughter's kiss. Chor. Antistroph. IX. Lo! still reproach upon reproach doth come; Hard are these things to judge: The spoiler shall be spoiled, The slayer pay his debt; Yea, while Zeus liveth through the ages, this Lives also that the doer bear his deed; For this is Heaven's decree. Who now can drive from out the kingly house The brood of curses dark? The house to AtÃ¨ cleaves. ClytÃ¦m. Antistroph. X. Yes, thou hast touched with truth That word oracular; But I for my part wish, (Binding with strongest oath The evil genius of the Pleisthenids,) Here the genealogy is carried one step further to Pleisthenes, the father of Tantalos Though hard it be to bear, To rest content with this our present lot; And, for the future, that he go to vex Another race with deaths at hands of kin. Lo! 'tis enough for me, Though small my share of wealth, At last to have freed my house From fratricidal hate. Enter Ãgisthos. Ãgis. Hail, kindly light of day that vengeance brings! Now I can say the Gods on high look down, Avenging men, upon the woes of earth, Since lying in the Erinnyes' woven robes I see this man, right welcome sight to me, Paying for deeds his father's hand had wrought. Atreus, our country's ruler, this man's father, Drove out my sire Thyestes, his own brother, (To tell the whole truth) quarrelling for rule, An exile from his country and his home. And coming back a suppliant on the hearth, The poor Thyestes found a lot secure, Nor did he, dying, stain the soil with blood, There in his home. But this man's godless sire, Atreus, more prompt than kindly in his deeds, On plea of keeping festal day with cheer, To my sire banquet gave of children's flesh, His own. The feet and finger-tips of hands He, sitting at the top, apart concealed; And straight the other, in his blindness taking The parts that could not be discerned, did eat A meal which, as thou see'st, perdition works For all his kin. And learning afterwards The deed of dread, he groaned and backward fell, Vomits that feast of blood, and imprecates On Pelops' sons a doom intolerable, And turns his spurning at the festive board, With fullest justice, to a general curse, That so might fall the race of Pleisthenes. And now thou see'st how this man fallen lies Accordingly; and I most justly came To weave the plot of murderous doom. For me, While yet a babe in swaddling-clothes, he banished With my poor father, me, his thirteenth child; And Justice brings me back, of full age grown: And e'en far off I wrought against this man, And planned the whole scheme of this dark device. And so e'en death were now right good for me, Seeing him into the nets of Justice fallen. Chor. I honour not this arrogance in guilt, Ãgisthos. Thou confessest thou hast slain Of thy free will our chieftain here,âthat thou Alone did'st plot this murder lamentable; Be sure, I say, thy head shall not escape The righteous curse a people hurls with stones. Ãgisth. Dost thou say this, though seated on the bench Of lowest oarsmen, while the upper row Commands the ship? The image is taken from the trireme with its three benches full of rowers. The Chorus is compared to the men on the lowest, Ãgisthos and ClytÃ¦mnestra to those on the uppermost bench. But thou shalt find, though old, How hard it is at such an age to learn, When self-control is ordered. But a prison And fasting pains are admirably apt, As prophet-healers even for old age. Dost thou not see it, thou who look'st on this? Kick not against the pricks, The earliest occurrence of the proverb with which we are familiar through the history of St Paul's conversion, Acts ix. 5, xxvi. 14. lest sore pain come. Chor. Thou, thou, O queen, when thy lord came from war, While keeping house, thy husband's bed defiling, Did'st scheme this death for this our hero-chief. Ãgisth. These words of thine shall parents prove of tears: But this thy tongue is Orpheus' opposite; He with his voice led all things on for joy, But thou, provoking with thy childish cries, Shalt now be led; and then being kept in check, Thou shalt appear in somewhat gentler mood. Chor. As though thou should'st o'er Argives ruler be, Who even when thou plotted'st this man's death Did'st lack good heart to do the deed thyself! Ãgisth. E'en so; to work this fraud was clearly part Fit for a woman. I was foe, of old Suspected. But now will I with his wealth See whether I his subjects may command, And him who will not hearken I will yoke In heavy harness as a full-fed colt, Nowise as trace-horse: The trace-horse, as not under the pressure of the collar, was taken as the type of free, those that wore the yoke, of enforced submission. but sharp hunger joined With darksome dungeon shall behold him tamed. Chor. Why did'st not thou then, coward as thou art, Thyself destroy him? but a woman with thee, Pollution to our land and our land's Gods, She slew him. Does Orestes see the light, Perchance, that he, brought back by Fortune's grace, May for both these prove slayer strong to smite? Ãgisth. Well, since thou think'st to act, not merely talk, Thou shalt know clearly. ... [Calling his Guards from the palace.] On then, my troops, the time for deeds is come. Chor. On then, let each man grasp his sword in hand. Ãgisth. With sword in hand, I too shrink not from death. Chor. Thou speak'st of thy death and we hail the word: And make our own the fortune it implies. ClytÃ¦m. Nay, let us not do other evil deeds, Thou dearest of all friends. An ill-starred harvest It is to have reaped so many. Enough of woe: Let no more blood be shed: Go thou,âgo ye, Ye aged sires, to your allotted homes, Ere ye do aught and pay the penalty; This that we have done ought to have sufficed; But should it prove we've had enough of ills, We will accept it gladly, stricken low In evil doom by heavy hand of God. This is a woman's counsel, if there be That deigns to hear it. Ãgisth. But that these should fling The blossoms of their idle speech at me, And utter words like these, so tempting Fate, And fail of counsel wise, and flout their ruler. ...! Chor. It suits not Argives on the vile to fawn. Ãgisth. Be sure, hereafter I will hunt thee down. Chor. Not so, if God should guide Orestes back. Ãgisth. I know right well how exiles feed on hopes. Chor. Prosper, wax fat, polluting right: 'tis thine. Ãgisth. Know thou shalt pay full price for this thy folly. Chor. Be bold and boast, like cock beside his mate. ClytÃ¦m. Nay, care not thou for these vain howlings; I And thou together, ruling o'er the house, Will settle all things rightly. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX OF RHYMED CHORUSES. Verses 40â248.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Nine weary years are gone and spent Since Menelaos' armament Sped forth, on work of vengeance bent, For Priam's guilty land; And with him Agamemnon there Throne, sceptre, army all did share; And so from Zeus the AtreidÃ¦ bear, Their two-fold high command. They a fleet of thousand sail, Strong in battle to prevail, Led from out our Argive coast, Shouting war-cries to the host; E'en as vultures do that utter Shrillest screams as round they flutter, Grieving for their nestlings lost, Plying still their oary wings In their lonely wanderings, Having lost the sweet unrest That bound them to their young ones' nest. And One on high of solemn state, Apollo, Pan, or Zeus the great, When he hears that shrill wild cry Of his clients in the sky, On them, the godless who offend, Erinnys slow and sure doth send. So 'gainst Alexandros then The sons of Atreus, chiefs of men, Zeus sent to work his high behest, True guardian of the host and guest. He, for bride of many a groom, On Danai, TroÃ¯ans sendeth doom, Many wrestlings, sinew-trying Of the knee in dust down-lying, Many a spear-shaft snapt asunder In the prelude of war's thunder. What shall be, shall, and still we see Fulfilled is destiny's decree; Nor by tears in secret shed, Nor by offerings o'er the dead, Will he soothe God's vengeful ire For altar hearths despoiled of fire. And we with age outworn and spent Are left behind that armament, With head upon our staff low bent. Weak our strength like that of boy; Youth's life-blood, in its bounding joy, For deeds of might is like to age, And knows not yet war's heritage: And the man whom many a year Hath bowed in withered age and sere, As with three feet creepeth on, Not stronger than his infant son, Like phantom form of day-dream gone. And now, O Queen, who tak'st thy name From Tyndareus of ancient fame, Our ClytÃ¦mnestra whom we own As rightly sharing Argos' throne! What tidings joyous hast thou heard, Token true or flattering word, That thou send'st to every shrine Solemn pomp in stately line; Shrines of Gods who reign in light, Or those who dwell in central night, Who in Heaven for aye abide, Or o'er the Agora preside. Lo, thy gifts on altars blaze, And here and there through heaven's wide ways The torches fling their fiery rays, Fed by soft and suasive spell Of the clear oil, flowing well From the royal treasure-cell. Telling what of this thou may, All that's meet to us to say, Do thou our haunting cares allay, Cares which now bring sore distress, While now bright hope, with power to bless, From out the sacrifice appears, And wardeth off our restless fears, The boding sense of coming fate, That makes the spirit desolate. Stroph. I. Yes, it is mine to tell What omens to our leaders then befell, Giving new strength for war, (For still though travelled far In life, by God's great gift to us belong The suasive powers of song,) To tell how those who bear O'er all AchÃ¦ans sway in equal share, Ruling in one accord The youth of Hellas that own each as lord, Were sent with mighty host By mighty birds against the TroÃ¯an coast, Kings of the air to kings of men appearing Near to the palace, on the right hand veering; On spot seen far and near, They with their talons tear A pregnant hare with all her unborn young, All her life's course in death's deep darkness flung. Oh raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail; Yet pray that good prevail! Antistroph. I. And then the host's wise seer Stood gazing on the AtreidÃ¦ standing near, Of diverse mood, and knew Those who the poor hare slew, And those who led the host with shield and spear, And spake his omens clear: âOne day this host shall go, And Priam's city in the dust lay low, And all the kine and sheep Countless, which they before their high towers keep, Fate shall with might destroy: Only take heed that no curse mar your joy, Nor blunt the edge of curb that TroÃ¯a waiteth, Smitten too soon, for Artemis still hateth The wingÃ¨d hounds that own Her father on his throne, Who slay the mother with the young unborn, And looks upon the eagle's feast with scorn Ah! raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail; Yet pray that good prevail. Epode. For she, the Fair One, though her mercy shields The lion's whelps, like dew-drops newly shed, And yeanling young of beasts that roam the fields, Yet prays her sire fulfil these omens dread, The good, yet evil too. And now I call on him, our healer true, Lest she upon the Danai send delays That keep our ships through many weary days, Urging a new strange rite, Unblest alike by man and God's high law, Evil close clinging, working sore despite, Marring a wife's true awe. For still there lies in wait, Fearful and ever new, Watching the hour its eager thirst to sate, Vengeance on those who helpless infants slew. Such things, ill mixed with good, great Calchas spake, As destined by the birds' strange auguries; And we too now our echoing answer make In loud and woeful cries: Oh raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail; Yet pray that good prevail. Stroph. II. O Zeus, whoe'er Thou be, If that name please Thee well, By that I call on Thee; For weighing all things else I fail to tell Of any name but Zeus; If once for all I seek Of all my haunting, troubled thoughts a truce, That name I still must speak. Antistroph. II. For He who once was great, Full of the might to war, Hath lost his high estate; And He who followed now is driven afar, Meeting his Master too: But if one humbly pay With 'bated breath to Zeus his honour due, He walks in wisdom's way,â Stroph. III. To Zeus, who men in wisdom's path doth train, Who to our mortal race Hath given the fixÃ¨d law that pain is gain; For still through his high grace True counsel falleth on the heart like dew, In deep sleep of the night, The boding thoughts that out of ill deeds grew; This too They work who sit enthronÃ¨d in their might. Antistroph. III. And then the elder leader of great fame Who ruled the AchÃ¦ans' ships, Not bold enough a holy seer to blame With words from reckless lips, But tempered to the fate that on him fell;â And when the host was vexed With tarryings long, scant stores, and surging swell, Chalkis still far off seen, and baffled hopes perplexed; Stroph. IV. And stormy blasts that down from Strymon sweep, And breed sore famine with the long delay, Hurl forth our men upon the homeless deep On many a wandering way; Sparing nor ships, nor ropes, nor sailing gear, Doubling the weary months, and vexing still The Argive host with fear. Then when as mightier charm for that dread ill, Hard for our ships to bear, From the seer's lips did âArtemisâ resound, The AtreidÃ¦ smote their staves upon the ground, And with no power to check, shed many a bitter tear. Antistroph. IV. And then the elder of the chiefs thus cried: âHard fate it is the Gods to disobey; Hard fate if I my child, my home's fond pride, With my own hands must slay, Polluting with the streams of maiden's blood A father's hands, the holy altar near. Which course hath least of good? How can I loss of ships and comrades bear? Right well may men desire, With craving strong, the blood of maiden pure, As charm to lull the winds and calm ensure; Ah, may there come the good to which our hopes aspire!â Stroph. V. Then, when he his spirit proud To the yoke of doom had bowed, While the blasts of altered mood O'er his soul swept like a flood, Reckless, godless and unblest; Thence new thoughts upon him pressed, Thoughts of evil, frenzied daring, (Still doth passion, base guile sharing, Mother of all evil, hold The power to make men bad and bold,) And he brought himself to slay His daughter, as on solemn day, Victim slain the ships to save, When for false wife fought the brave. Antistroph. V. All her cries and loud acclaim, Calling on her father's name,â All her beauty fresh and fair, They heeded not in their despair, Their eager lust for conflict there. And her sire the attendants bade To lift her, when the prayer was said, Above the altar like a kid, Her face and form in thick veil hid; Yea, with ruthless heart and bold, O'er her gracious lips to hold Their watch, and with the gag's dumb pain From evil-boding words restrain. Stroph. VI. And then upon the ground Pouring the golden streams of saffron veil, She cast a glance around That told its piteous tale, At each of those who stood prepared to slay, Fair as the form by skilful artist drawn, And wishing, all in vain, her thoughts to say; For oft of old in maiden youth's first dawn, Within her father's hall, Her voice to song did call, To chant the praises of her sire's high state, His fame, thrice blest of Heaven, to celebrate. Antistroph. VI. What then ensued mine eyes Saw not, nor may I tell, but not in vain The arts of Calchas wise; For justice sends again, The lesson âpain is gainâ for them to learn: But for our piteous fate since help is none, With voice that bids âGood-bye,â we from it turn Ere yet it come, and this is all as one With weeping ere the hour, For soon will come in power To-morrow's dawn, and good luck with it come! So speaks the guardian of this Apian home. Verses 346â471.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation O great and sovran Zeus, O Night, Great in glory, great in might, Who round TroÃ¯a's towers hast set, Enclosing all, thy close-meshed net, So that neither small nor great Can o'erleap the bond-slave's fate, Or woe that maketh desolate; Zeus, the God of host and guest, Worker of all this confessed, He by me shall still be blest. Long since, 'gainst Alexandros He Took aim with bow that none may flee, That so his arrows onward driven, Nor miss their mark, nor pierce the heaven. Stroph. I. Yes, they lie smitten low, If so one dare to speak, by stroke of Zeus; Well one may trace the blow; The doom that He decreed their soul subdues. And though there be that say The Gods for mortal men care not at all, Though they with reckless feet tread holiest way, These none will godly call. Now is it to the children's children clear Of those who, overbold, More than was meet, breathed Discord's spirit drear; While yet their houses all rich store did hold Beyond the perfect mean. Ah! may my lot be free from all that harms, My soul may nothing wean From calm contentment with her tranquil charms For nought is there in wealth That serves as bulwark 'gainst the subtle stealth Of Destiny and Doom, For one who, in the pride of wanton mood, Spurns the great altar of the Right and Good. Antistroph. I. Yea, a strange impulse wild Urges him on, resistless in its might, AtÃ¨'s far-scheming child. It knows no healing, is not hid in night, That mischief lurid, dark; Like bronze that will not stand the test of wear, A tarnished blackness in its hue we mark; And like a boy who doth a bird pursue Swift-floating on the wing, He to his country hopeless woe doth bring; And no God hears their prayer, But sendeth down the unrighteous to despair, Whose hands are stained with sin. So was it Paris came His entrance to the AtreidÃ¦'s home to win, And brought its queen to shame, To shame that brand indelible hath set Upon the board where host and guest were met. Stroph. II. And leaving to her countrymen to bear Wild whirl of ships of war and shield and spear, And bringing as her dower, Death's doom to Ilion's tower, She hath passed quickly through the palace gate, Daring what none should dare; And lo! the minstrel seers bewail the fate That home must henceforth bear; âWoe for the kingly house and for its lord; Woe for the marriage-bed and paths which still A vanished love doth fill! There stands he, wronged, yet speaking not a word Of scorn from wrathful will, Seeing with utter woe that he is left Of her fair form bereft; And in his yearning love For her who now is far beyond the sea, A phantom queen through all the house shall rove; And all the joy doth flee The sculptured forms of beauty once did give; And in the penury of eyes that live, All AphroditÃ¨'s grace Is vanished into space. Antistroph. II. And spectral forms in visions of the night Come, bringing sorrow with their vain delight: For vain it is when one Thinks that great joy is near, And, passing through his hands, the dream is gone On gliding wings, that bear The vision far away on paths of sleep.â Such woes were felt at home Upon the sacred altar of the hearth, And worse than these remain for those who roam From Hellas' parent earth: In every house, in number measureless, Is seen a sore distress: Yea, sorrows pierce the heart: For those who from his home he saw depart Each knoweth all too well; And now, instead of warrior's living frame, There cometh to the home where each did dwell The scanty ashes, relics of the flame, The urns of bronze that keep The dust of those that sleep. Stroph. III. For Ares, who from bodies of the slain Reapeth a golden gain, And holdeth, like a trafficker, his scales, E'en where the torrent rush of war prevails, From Ilion homeward sends But little dust, yet burden sore for friends, O'er which, smooth-lying in the brazen urn, They sadly weep and mourn, Now for this man as foremost in the strife, And now for that who in the battle fell, Slain for another's wife. And muttered curses some in secret tell, And jealous discontent Against the AtreidÃ¦ who as champions led The mighty armament; And some around the wall, the goodly dead, Have there in alien land their monument, And in the soil of foes Take in the sleep of death their last repose. Antistroph. III. And lo! the murmurs which our country fill Are as a solemn curse, And boding anxious fear expecteth still To hear of evil worse. Not blind the Gods, but giving fullest heed To those who cause a nation's wounds to bleed; And the dark-robed Erinnyes in due time By adverse chance and change Plunge him who prospers though defiled by crime, In deepest gloom, and through its formless range No gleams of help appear. O'er-vaunted glory is a perilous thing; For on it Zeus, whose glance fills all with fear, His thunderbolts doth fling. That fortune fair I praise That rouseth not the Gods to jealousy. May I ne'er tread the devastator's ways, Nor as a prisoner see My life wear out in drear captivity! Epode. And now at bidding of the courier-flame, Herald of great good news, A murmur swift through all the city came; But whether it with truth its course pursues, Who knows? or whether God who dwells on high, With it hath sent a lie? Who is so childish, or of sense bereft, As first to feel the glow That message of the herald fire has left, And then to sink down low, Because the rumour changes in its sound? It is a woman's mood To accept a boon before the truth is found: Too quickly she believes in tidings good, And so the line exact That marks the truth of fact Is over-passed, and with quick doom of death A glory spread by woman perisheth. Verses 665â782.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Who was it named her with such foresight clear? Could it be One of might, In strange prevision of her work of fear, Guiding the tongue aright? Who gave that war-wed, strife-upstirring one The name of Helen, ominous of ill? For 'twas through her that Hellas was undone, That woes from Hell men, ships, and cities fill. Out from the curtains, gorgeous in their fold, Wafted by breeze of Zephyr, earth's strong child, She her swift way doth hold; And hosts of mighty men, as hunters bold That bear the spear and shield, Wait on the track of those who steered their way Unseen where Simois flows by leafy field, Urged by a strife that came with power to slay. Antistroph. I. And so the wrath which doth its work fulfil To Ilion brought, well-named, A marriage marring all, avenging still For friendship wronged and shamed, And outrage foul on Zeus, of host and guest The guardian God, from those who then did raise The bridal hymn of marriage-feast unblest Which called the bridegroom's kin to shouts of praise. But now by woe oppressed Priam's ancient city waileth very sore, And calls on Paris unto dark doom wed, Suffering yet more and more For all the blood of heroes vainly shed, And bearing through the long protracted years A life of wailing grief and bitter tears. Stroph. II. One was there who did rear A lion's whelp within his home to dwell, A monster waking fear, Weaned from the mother's milk it loved so well: Then in life's dawning light, Loved by the children, petted by the old, Oft in his arms clasped tight, As one an infant newly-born would hold, With eye that gleamed beneath the fondling hand, And fawning as at hunger's strong command. Antistroph. II. But soon of age full grown, It showed the inbred nature of its sire, And wrought unasked, alone, A feast to be that fostering nurture's hire; Gorged full with slaughtered sheep, The house was stained with blood as with a curse No slaves away could keep, A murderous mischief waxing worse and worse, Sent as from God a priest from AtÃ¨ fell, And reared within the man's own house to dwell. Stroph. III. So I would say to Ilion then there came Mood as of calm when every wind is still, The gentle pride and joy of noble fame, The eye's soft glance that all the soul doth thrill; Love's full-blown flower that brings The thorn that wounds and stings; And yet she turned aside, And of the marriage feast wrought bitter end, Coming to dwell where Priam's sons abide, Ill sojourner, ill friend, Sent by great Zeus the God of host and guest, A true Erinnys by all wives unblest. Antistroph. III. There lives a saying framed of ancient days, And in men's minds imprinted firm and fast, That great good fortune never childless stays, But brings forth issue,âthat on fame at last There rushes on apace Great woe for all the race; But I, apart, alone, Hold a far other and a worthier creed: The impious act is by ill issue known, Most like the parent deed; While still for all who love the Truth and Right, Good fortune prospers, fairer and more bright. Stroph. IV. But wanton Outrage done in days of old Another wanton Outrage still doth bear, And mocks at human woes with scorn o'erbold, Or soon or late as they their fortune share. That other in its turn Begets Satiety, And lawless Might that doth all hindrance spurn, And sacred right defy, Two AtÃ¨s fell within their dwelling-place, Like to their parent race. Antistroph. IV. Yet Justice still shines bright in dwellings murk And dim with smoke, and honours calm content; But gold-bespangled homes, where guilt doth lurk, She leaves with glance in horror backward bent, And draws with reverent fear To places holier far, And little recks the praise the prosperous hear, Whose glories tarnished are; But still towards its destined goal she brings The whole wide course of things. Say then, son of Atreus, thou Who com'st as Troia's conqueror now, What form of welcome right and meet, What homage thy approach to greet, Shall I now use in measure true, Nor more nor less than that is due? Many men there are, I wis, Who in seeming place their bliss, Caring less for that which is. If one suffers, then their wail Loudly doth the ear assail; Yet have they nor lot nor part In the grief that stirs the heart. So too the joyous men will greet With smileless faces counterfeit: But shepherd who his own sheep knows Will scan the lips that fawn and gloze, Ready still to praise and bless With weak and watery kindliness. Thou when thou the host did'st guide For Helenâtruth I will not hideâ In mine eyes had'st features grim, Such as unskilled art doth limn, Not guiding well the helm of thought, And giving souls with grief o'erwrought False courage from fresh victims brought. But with nought of surface zeal, Now full glad of heart I feel, And hail thy acts as deeds well done: Thou too in time shalt know each one, And learn who wrongly, who aright In house or city dwells in might. Verses 947â1001.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Why thus continually Do ever haunting phantoms hover nigh My heart that bodeth ill? Why doth the prophet's strain unbidden still, Unbought, flow on and on? Why on my mind's dear throne Hath faith lost all her former power to fling That terror from me as an idle thing? Yet since the ropes were fastened in the sand That moored the ships to land, When the great naval host to Ilion went, Time hath passed on to feeble age and spent. Antistroph. I. And now as face to face, Myself reporting to myself, I trace Their safe return; and yet My mind, taught by itself, cannot forget Erinnys' dolorous cry, That lyreless melody, And hath no strength of wonted confidence. Not vain these pulses of the inward sense, As my heart beateth in its wild unrest, Within true-boding breast; And hoping against hope, I yet will pray My fears may all prove false and pass away. Stroph. II. Of high o'erflowing health There is no limit found that satisfies; For soon by force or stealth, As foe 'gainst whom but one poor wall doth rise, Disease upon it presses, and the lot Of fair good fortune onward moves until It strikes on unseen reef where help is not. But should fear move their will For safety of their freight, With measured sling a part they sacrifice, And so avert their fate, Lest the whole house should sink no more to rise, O'erwhelmed with misery; Nor does the good ship perish utterly! So too abundant gift, From Zeus in double plenty, from the earth, Doth the worn soul from anxious care uplift, And turns the famished wail to bounding joy and mirth. Antistroph. II. But blood that once is shed In purple stream of death upon the ground, Who then, when life is fled, A charm to call it back again hath found? Else against him who raised the dead to life Zeus had not sternly warred, as warning given To all men; but if Fate were not at strife With fate that brings from Heaven Help from the Gods, my heart, Out-stripping speech, had given thought free vent. But now in gloom apart It sits and moans in sullen discontent, And hath no hope that e'er It shall an issue seasonably fair From out the tangled skein Of life's strange course unravel straight and clear. While in the fever of continuing pain My soul doth burden sore of troublous anguish bear.</field>
