      <field name="fulltext">The Tempest; Or, The Enchanted Island; A Play In Five Acts</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS. This is one of the last plays which Shakspeare wrote. Dr. Warburton says of it—“This play, and ‘Midsummer Night's Dream,’ are the noblest efforts of that sublime and amazing imagination, peculiar to Shakspeare, which soars above the bounds of nature, without forsaking sense; or, more properly, carries nature along with him, beyond her established limits.” Shakspeare had now written more than thirty plays, and, like other hackneyed authors, he began to be weary of his employment. But he had a resource in fancy, to which others apply in vain. Tired of the same dull round of forming men and women, he said—“Let there be spirits, fairies, goblins, and monsters.” At his word, these supernatural things had dramatic existence. But, however the learned may admire the poet's grand conception, and the complete execution of all that they can conceive he meant to do, to make this play perfection; it would never have become a favourite on the stage, without the aid of Dryden's alteration. The human beings in the original drama had not business enough on the scene, to make human beings anxious about them: and the preternatural characters were more wonderful than pleasing; for, whilst an auditor or a reader pours forth his praise before the Creator of Caliban, he loathes the creature. Ariel, opposed to this monster, is one of those happy contrasts, which Shakspeare deals in; yet, this airy and mild spirit cannot charm an audience, except by singing. Nor could the love scenes produce much sympathy, but from the artlessness of the objects concerned. Ignorance of what their own sensations mean, is the charm which alone elevates those pleasing characters, above the common order of insipid lovers. “The Tempest” contains some of the author's best poetry—the noted passage of “cloud-capp'd towers” is here; also some exquisite descriptions of wild rural scenery; and there is a sublimity in the pinches, cramps, and aches, of Caliban; his bogs, fens, flats, moles, barnacles, and apes—as well as in the oaks, rocks, winds, sea, earth, and air, of Prospero. Dr. Warburton's praises of “The Tempest,” are thus supported by Dr. Johnson's following eulogium: “In a single drama are here exhibited princes, courtiers, and sailors, all speaking in their real characters. There is the agency of airy spirits, and of an earthly goblin; the operation of magic, the tumults of a storm, the adventures of a desert island, the native effusion of untaught affection, the punishment of guilt, and the final happiness of the pair, for whom our reason and our passions are equally interested.” All these things are doubtless comprised in “The Tempest,” except the last implied quality—one, of all others, which an audience can, perhaps, the least dispense with. This drama does not interest the passions. Less variety might have engaged them; but here genius has been too much expanded. Exercised on fewer objects, its force had been concentrated, and more effectual. The senses are, indeed, powerfully engaged by the grandeur of the spectacle in a London theatre—and the senses highly gratified, are sometimes mistaken, by the possessor himself—for the passions.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE I. The Cell of Prospero. Enter Prospero, meeting Miranda. Pro. Miranda, where's your sister? Mir. Sir, I saw her Climbing tow'rds yon high point, whence I am come From gazing on the ocean:—A brave creature, (Who has, no doubt, some other creatures in her,) Toss'd on the waste of waters,— Pro. Be collected; I shall do nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my daughter, and thy pretty sister.— You both are ignorant of what you are, Nought knowing Of whence I am; nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And your no greater father. Mir. More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts. Pro. 'Tis time, I should inform thee further.—Lend thy hand, And pluck my magic garment from me.—So; [Lays down his Mantle and Wand. Lie there, my art.— The fated wreck of that same gallant ship I shall with such provision in mine art So safely order, That not so much perdition as a hair, Shall 'tide to any creature in the vessel.— Sit down; For thou must now know further. Mir. You have often Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp'd, And left me to a bootless inquisition; Concluding,—“Stay, not yet.’ Pro. The hour's now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; Obey, and be attentive.— [Miranda sits down. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst; for then thou wast not Out three years old. Mir. Certainly, sir, I can. Pro. By what? by any other house, or person? Of any thing the image tell me, that Hath kept with thy remembrance. Mir. 'Tis far off; And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants:—Had I not Four or five women once, that tended me? Pro. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda: But how is it, That this lives in thy mind? What see'st thou else In the dark backward and abysme of time? If thou remember'st aught, ere thou cam'st here, How thou cam'st here, thou may'st. Mir. But that I do not. Pro. Fifteen years since, my child, but fifteen years, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. Mir. Sir, are not you my father? Pro. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said, you were my daughters; and your father Was Duke of Milan: thou, my girl, his heir, A princess, no worse issu'd. Mir. O the Heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? Or blessed was't, we did? Pro. Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence; But blessedly holp hither. Mir. O, my heart bleeds To think o'the teen that I have turn'd you to, Which is from my remembrance!—Please you, further. Pro. My brother, and thy uncle, call'd Antonio,— I pray thee, mark me,—that a brother should Be so perfidious!—to him I put The manage of my government, And to my state grew stranger, being transported, And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me? Mir. Sir, most heedfully. Pro. Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was The ivy, which had hid my princely trunk, And suck'd my verdure out on't.—Thou attend'st not. Mir. O, good sir, I do. Pro. Being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, He needs will be Absolute Milan: Me, poor man!—my library Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable: confederates, So dry he was for sway, with the king of Naples, To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom, yet unbow'd, (alas, poor Milan!) To most ignoble stooping:—Whereupon, A treacherous army levy'd, one mid-night Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open The gates of Milan; and, i'the dead of darkness, The ministers for the purpose hurry'd thence Me, thy young sister, and thy crying self. Mir. Alack, for pity!— Pro. Hear a little further, And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon us; without the which, this story Were most impertinent. Mir. Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us? Pro. Girl, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, set A mark so bloody on the business; but With colours, fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurry'd us aboard a bark; Bore us some leagues to sea: where they prepar'd A rotten carcase of a boat, not rigg'd, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, To cry to the sea that roar'd to us; to sigh To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong. Mir. Alack! what trouble Were we then to you! Pro. O! two cherubim Ye were, that did preserve me; ye did smile, Infused with a fortitude from Heaven; Which rais'd in me An undergoing stomach, to bear up Against what should ensue. Mir. How came we ashore? Pro. By providence divine.— Some food we had, and some fresh water, that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, (he being then appointed Master of this design,) did give us; with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much: so, of his gentleness, Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me, From my own library, with volumes that I prize above my dukedom. Mir. 'Would I might But ever see that man! [Rises. Pro. Mark me,—and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arriv'd; and here Have I, your schoolmaster, made you more profit Than other princes can, that have more time For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful. Mir. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, (For still 'tis beating in my mind,) your reason For raising this sea-storm? Pro. Know thus far forth:— By accident most strange, bountiful fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought on these seas; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star; whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. [Takes up his Wand, and charms Miranda to Sleep. Here cease more questions; [Miranda sinks into her Seat. Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, And give it way:—I know, thou canst not chuse.— [Miranda sleeps.—Prospero puts on his Mantle. Come away, servant, come: I am ready now; Approach, my Ariel; come. Enter Ariel. Ari. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, To swim, to dive into the sea, to ride On the curl'd clouds; to thy strong bidding, task Ariel, and all his quality. Pro. Hast thou, spirit, Prepar'd to point the Tempest that I bade thee? Ari. To every article. Pro. What is the time o'the day? Ari. Past the mid season. Pro. At least two glasses: The time 'twixt six and now, Must by us both be spent most preciously. Ari. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, Which is not yet perform'd me. Pro. How now,—moody? What is't thou canst demand? Ari. My liberty. Pro. Before the time be out! no more. Ari. I pray thee: Remember, I have done thee worthy service; Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv'd Without or grudge, or grumblings: thou didst promise To bate me a full year. Pro. Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee? Ari. No. Pro. Thou dost; and think'st it much, to tread the ooze Of the salt deep; To run upon the sharp wind of the north; To do me business in the veins o'the earth, When it is bak'd with frost. Ari. I do not, sir. Pro. Thou ly'st, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who, with age, and envy, Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? Ari. No, sir. Pro. Thou hast: Where was she born? Speak; tell me. Ari. Sir, in Argier. Pro. O, was she so? I must, Once in a month, recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know'st, was banish'd; for one thing she did, They would not take her life:—Is not this true? Ari. Ay, sir. Pro. This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by the sailors: Thou, my slave, As thou report'st thyself, was then her servant: And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthly, and abhorr'd commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers, And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison'd, thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died, And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike: Then was this island, (Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp, hag-born,) not honour'd with A human shape. Ari. Yes: Caliban her son. Pro. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax Could not again undo; it was mine art, When I arriv'd, and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. Ari. I thank thee master. Pro. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters more. Ari. Pardon, master: I will be correspondent to command, And do my spiriting gently. Pro. Do so; and after two days I will discharge thee. Ari. That's my noble master! What shall I do? say, what? what shall I do? Pro. Go, with the spirits under thy command, Let loose the Tempest, as I bade thee: then Disperse the stranded crew about the isle, And bring the king's son, Ferdinand, to my cell.— Be subject to no sight but mine; invisible To every eyeball else. Ari. Master, I shall. SONG BY ARIEL. O, bid thy faithful Ariel fly To the furthest India's sky Or, to do thy great command, Traverse o'er more distant land; I'll climb the mountains, plunge the deep,— I, like mortals, never sleep,— I'll do thy task, whate'er it be, Not with ill will, but merrily. [Exit. Pro. Awake; dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well: Awake! Mir. The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me. Pro. Shake it off; come on; [Miranda rises. We'll visit Caliban, my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. Mir. 'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. Pro. But as 'tis, We cannot miss him; he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood: and serves in offices That profit us.—What ho!—Slave! Caliban!— Thou earth, thou! speak. [Caliban without. Cal. There's wood enough within. Pro. Come forth, I say; there's other business for thee; Come forth, thou tortoise! when? Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself, Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! Enter Caliban, from his Den. [Exit Miranda. Cal. As wicked dew, as e'er my mother brush'd With raven's feather from unwholesome fen, Drop on you both! A south west blow on you, And blister you all o'er! Pro. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, Side stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd As thick as honey-combs; each pinch more stinging Than bees that made them. Cal. I must eat my dinner. This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou tak'st from me. When thou camest first, Thou strok'dst me and mad'st much of me; would'st give me Water with berries in't; and teach me how To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee, And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile; Cursed be I that did so!—All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest of the island. Pro. Most abhorred slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill, I have us'd thee, Filth as thou art, with human care:—I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, Know thy own meaning, but would'st gabble like A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known: but thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou Deservedly confin'd into this rock, Who hadst deserv'd more than a prison. Cal. You taught me language; and my profit on't Is, I know how to curse; The red plague rid you, For learning me your language! Pro. Hag-seed, hence! Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou wert best, To answer other business.—Shrug'st thou, malice? If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps; Fill all thy bones with aches; make thee roar, That beasts shall tremble at thy din. Cal. No, 'pray thee! I must obey: his art is of such power, It would controll my dam's god Setebos, And make a vassal of him. Pro. So, slave; hence! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Foot of a Promontory. Enter Miranda, meeting Dorinda. Dor. O, sister, sister,—what have I beheld! Mir. What is it moves you so? Dor. From yonder rock, As I mine eyes cast down upon the sea, The whistling winds blew rudely in my face, And the waves roar'd;—at first, I thought the war Had been between themselves; but straight I spy'd A strange huge creature,— Mir. O, you mean the ship. Dor. Is't not a creature then? It seem'd alive. Mir. Well,—but, what of it? Dor. This floating ram did bear his horns aloft All ty'd with ribands ruffling in the wind; Sometimes he nodded down his head awhile, And then the waves did heave him to the moon. Mir. But, sister, I have stranger news to tell you:— In this great creature there are other creatures, And shortly we may chance to see that thing Which you have heard my father call—a man. Dor. But what is that? for yet he never told me. Mir. I know no more than you; but I have heard My father say, we women were made for him. Dor. Made for him? What, that he should eat us, sister? Mir. No, sure; you see my father is a man, And yet he does us good. Dor. Methinks, it would Be finer, sister, if we had two young fathers. Mir. No, sister, no; because, if they were young, My father said that we must call them—brothers. Dor. How comes it, then, that we two are not brothers? And how came he to be our father too? Mir. I believe, he found us, when we both were little, And grew within the ground. Dor. Why did'nt he find more of us? 'Pray, dear sister Let you and me look up and down one day, To find some little ones for us to play with. Mir. Agreed.—But now we must go in; this is The hour wherein my father's charm will work, Which seizes all that are in open air. The effect of his great art I long to see, Which will perform as much as magic can. Dor. And I, methinks more long to see a man. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE I. The Sea.—A Ship in a Tempest. Ariel firing the Ship. Spirits of the Winds dancing. Chorus by Spirits of the Storm. Arise, ye terrors of the storm, Appall the guilty eye! Tear the wild waves, ye mighty winds, Ye blasting lightnings, fly! Dart thro' the Tempest of the deep, And rocks and seas confound! [Loud Thunder. Hark, how the vengeful thunders roll! Amazement flames around. Behold,—the fate-devoted bark Dash'd on the trembling shore! Mercy!—the sinking wretches cry,— Mercy!—they're heard no more. [The Ship seems to founder.—Ariel and all the other Spirits disappear. SCENE II. The Cave of Hippolyto. Enter Prospero. Pro. 'Tis not yet fit, I let my daughters know That I have rear'd the princely heir of Mantua, As I have them, from childhood in this isle. His father, dying, bequeath'd him to my care, That I should breed him equal to his birth. O, thou false brother! was it not enough To usurp my state, but that thou must betray My pupil's dukedom to the Neapolitan, And doom him to the fate design'd for me!— By calculation of his birth, I saw Death threatening him, if, till some time were pass'd, He should behold the face of any woman; And now the danger's nigh.—Hippolyto!— Approach, young man; come forth:—Hippolyto!— Enter Hippolyto. Hip. Sir, I attend your pleasure. Pro. How I have lov'd thee from thy infancy, Heaven knows, and thou thyself canst bear me witness; Therefore accuse me not for thy restraint. Hip. I murmur not; but I may wonder at it. Pro. O, gentle youth, fate waits for thee abroad, A black star threatens thee, and death unseen Stands ready to devour thee. Hip. Sir, I have often heard you say, no creature Liv'd in this isle, but those which man was lord of:— Why then should I fear? Pro. But here are creatures which I nam'd not to thee; Those dangerous enemies of men, call'd women. Hip. Women!—I never heard of them before. What are women like? Pro. Imagine something 'tween young men and angels, Fatally beauteous, and with killing eyes: Their voices charm beyond the nightingale's; They are all enchantment; those, who once behold them, Are made their slaves for ever:— Therefore, if you should chance to see them,—mark me,— Avoid them straight, I charge you. Hip. Well, since you say they are so dangerous, I'll so far shun them, as I may with safety Of the unblemish'd honour which you taught me: But let them not provoke me; for, I'm sure, I shall not then forbear them. Pro. Go in, and read the book I gave you last. Hip. I shall obey you, sir. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Valley in the Island. Enter Prospero. Pro. So, so; I hope this lesson has secur'd him; For I have been constrain'd to change his lodging From the rude rock where I have bred him up, And bring him to the neighbourhood of my cell, Because the shipwreck happen'd near his mansion.— How, my daughters!— I thought I had instructed them enough.— Enter Miranda and Dorinda. Children, retire:—Why do you walk this way? Mir. It is within our bounds, sir. Pro. But both take heed, that path is very dangerous: Remember what I told you. Dor. Is the man that way, sir? Pro. All, that you can imagine ill, is there: The curled lion, and the rugged bear, Are not so dreadful as that savage man. Dor. But I would stroke him, father, And make him gentle, then he would not hurt me. Pro. You must not trust him, child.—But I must in; For now my operant spells require my presence.— Be you, Miranda, guardian to your sister. [Exit Prospero. Dor. Come, sister, let us walk the other way, The man will catch us else; we've but two legs, And he, perhaps, has four. Mir. Well, sister, though he have, yet look about you, And we shall spy him, ere he come too near us. Dor. Come back, come back; that way is tow'rd his den. Mir. Let me alone: I'll venture first; for sure He can devour but one of us at once.— I will go softly:—if you see him first, Be sure, you call me to take care of you. [Exit Miranda. Dor. Nay, I confess, I would fain see him too: I find a longing in my very nature, Because my father has forbidden me. [Exit Dorinda. SCENE IV. The Cave of Hippolyto. Enter Hippolyto, reading. Hip. Prospero has often said that nature makes Nothing in vain: why then are women made? I'll ask that question, when I see him next. Enter Dorinda and Miranda, from behind. Dor. O, sister, there it is:—it walks about Like one of us. Mir. Ay, just so,—and has legs as we have too. Hip. It strangely puzzles me: yet, 'tis most likely, Women are somewhat between men and spirits. Mir. Hark, hark! it talks. Why, sure this is not it My father meant:—'tis just like one of us. Dor. I am not half so much afraid on't as I was:—see, see, it turns this way.— Heav'n! what a pretty thing it is! Mir. I'll go nearer it. Dor. O no; 'tis dangerous, sister: I'll go to it. Mir. I would not for the world that you should venture; My father charg'd me to secure you from it. Dor. I warrant you, this is a tame man, sister: He will not hurt me; I see it by his looks. Pro. [Without.] What ho! what ho!—Miranda, child, where are you? Mir. Do you not hear my father call? go in. Dor. 'Twas you he call'd, not me.—Make haste, make hase:— You would not let my father wait, I hope. Pro. [Without.] Miranda, child,— Mir. Come, sister, come with me. [Exit Miranda. Dor. Though I die for't, I must have t'other peep. Hip. [Turns, and sees her.] What thing is that? Sure 'tis some favourite infant of the sun. My sight is dazzled.—I'll go nearer to it.— May it not be that beauteous murderer, woman, Whom I was charg'd to shun? Speak, speak,—what art thou, Shining vision? Dor. Alas, I know not; but, I'm told, I am A woman.—Do not hurt me, 'pray, fair thing. Hip. Won't you hurt me, fair thing? for, I was told, A woman was my enemy. Dor. I never knew What 'twas to be an enemy; nor can I e'er prove so to that, which looks like you: Although I fear you are a man, that lion, That dangerous thing, of which I have been warn'd. 'Pray, tell me what you are. Hip. In truth, I was inform'd I am a man; But, if I fright you, I shall wish I were Some other creature. Dor. No, you do not fright me. Pro. [Without.] Dorinda! Dor. My father calls again. Ah! I must leave you. Hip. Alas, I'm subject to the same command. Dor. This is my first offence against my father, Which severing us too cruelly does punish. Hip. And this is my first trespass too; but he Hath more offended truth than we have him: He said, our meeting would destructive be; Yet I no death but in our parting see. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A naked Part of the Island. Thunder, Wind, Rain. Enter Caliban, bearing a Bundle of Wood. Cal. All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him By inchmeal a disease! [Throws off his Load. His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin shows, pitch me i'the mire, Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid them; but For every trifle they are set upon me; Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me, And after, bite me; then like hedge-hogs, which Lie tumbling in my bare-foot way, and mount Their pricks at my foot-fall; sometime am I All wound with adders, who, with cloven tongues, Do hiss me into madness. [Wind and Rain. Trinculo. [Without.] O, O, O,— Cal. Lo, now! lo! Here comes a spirit of his; and to torment me, For bringing wood in slowly: I'll fall flat; Perchance he will not mind me. [Lies down. Enter Trinculo. Trin. Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i'the wind: if it should thunder, as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond' same cloud cannot chuse but fall by pailfuls,—What have we here? a man or a fish?—Dead or alive?— A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient, and fish-like smell; a kind of, not the newest, poor John.— A strange fish! Legg'd like a man! and his fins like arms!—Warm, o'my troth!—I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer; this is no fish, but an islander, that has lately suffered by a thunderbolt.— [Wind and Rain.]—Alas! the storm is come again: my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows: I will here shroud, till the dregs of the storm be past. [Lies down behind Caliban. Enter Stephano, singing; a Keg in his Hand. Step. I shall no more to sea, to sea, Here shall I die ashore;— This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral: —Well, here's my comfort. [Drinks, The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I, The gunner, and his mate, Lov'd Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery, But none of us car'd for Kate: For she had a tongue with a twang, Would cry to a sailor, “Go hang:” Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang. This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort. [Drinks. Cal. Do not torment me: O! Step. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon us with savages, and men of Inde?—Ha! I have not 'scap'd drowning, to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, as proper a man as ever went on four legs, cannot make him give ground: and it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at nostrils. Cal. This spirit torments me: O!— Step. This is some monster of the isle, with four legs; who has got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that: if I can recover him, and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather. Cal. Do not torment me, 'pr'ythee; I'll bring my wood home faster.—O, O, O!— Step. He's in his fit now; and does not talk after the wisest: he shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit: if I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly. Cal. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt Anon, I know it by thy trembling: Now Prosper works upon thee. Step. [Raising Caliban.] Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat; open your mouth:—[Makes Caliban drink.]—This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly:—[Takes the Keg from his Mouth.]—You cannot tell who's your friend: open your chaps again. [Caliban takes the Keg, and drinks. Trin. I should know that voice: it should be— but he is drown'd; and these are devils: O! defend me!— Step. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches, and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.—Come, amen!— [Takes the Keg from Caliban, who lies down again.] —I will pour some in thy other mouth. Trin. Stephano,— Step. Doth thy other mouth call me! Mercy! Mercy! This is a devil, and no monster. Trin. Stephano!—if thou be'st Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo;—be not afeard,—thy good friend Trinculo. Step. If thou be'st Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull thee by the lesser legs.—Thou art very Trinculo, indeed: How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent Trinculos. Trin. I took him to be kill'd with a thunder-stroke. —And art thou living, Stephano! O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scap'd! [Runs and embraces him, turning him round. Step. 'Pr'ythee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant. Cal. These be fine things, and if they be not sprites. That's a brave god, and bears celestial liquor. Step. How did'st thou 'scape? How cam'st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither! —[Gives Trinculo the Keg,—he drinks.]—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved over board.—How escaped'st thou? Trin. Swam ashore, man, like a duck.—O, Stephano, hast any more of this? [Gives Stephano the Keg. Step. The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! How does thine ague? Cal. Hast thou not dropped from heaven? Step. Out o'the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man in the moon, when time was. Cal. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee: My mistress showed me thee, thy dog, and bush. Step. Come, swear to that;—[Gives Caliban the Keg.]—kiss the book: I will furnish it anon with new contents: swear. [Caliban drinks greedily. Trin. By this good light, this is a very shallow monster:—I afeard of him?—a very weak monster —the man i'the moon!—A most poor, credulous monster. Step. Well drawn, monster, in good sooth. [Takes the Keg from Caliban. Cal. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' the island; And I'll kiss thy foot: I pr'ythee, be my god. Trin. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster; when his god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle. Cal. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wond'rous man. Trin. A most ridiculous monster: to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.—Ah me! Cal. I pr'ythee, let me bring thee where crabs grow: And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts; Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmozet; I'll bring thee To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee Young sea-mells from the rock: Wilt thou go with me? Step. I pr'ythee now, lead the way, without any more talking.—What, Trinculo,—weeping?—You spill your wine out of your eyes; you shall drink no more. Trin. This will be a doleful day with my poor girl: she gave me a gilt nutmeg at parting: that's lost too. —But, come, sorrow is dry,—[Takes the Keg.] Here's to you, Stephano. [Drinks. Step. Beshrew thy heart, for putting me in mind of my wife: It's a good old jade;—she has but one eye left, and she will weep out that too, when she hears that I am drowned.—[Takes the Keg.] But here's my comfort. [Drinks. Trin. A man had as good e'en be a fish as a man, for any comfort is likely to be got in this island:— We may lie at hull here till the wind blow north and by south, ere we can cry—“A sail! a sail!”—at sight of a white apron. Step. Trinculo, the king, and all our company, being drowned, we will inherit here.—Here; bear my bottle, [Gives the Keg to Caliban, who drinks it empty.] —and lead the way, monster.—Fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again. Caliban sings drunkenly. No more dams I'll make for fish; Nor fetch in firing, At requiring, Nor scrape trench'ring, nor wash dish; 'Ban, 'Ban, Ca—Caliban, Has a new master;—Get a new man. Trin. Step. and Cal. 'Ban, 'Ban, Ca—Caliban, Has a new master;—Get a new man. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. A wild and beautiful Part of the Island, on the Seashore. Enter Ariel and other Spirits. SONG—BY ARIEL. Come unto these yellow sands, And then take hands; Enter other Spirits, dancing. Foot it featly here and there; And, sweet sprites, the burden bear. Chorus of Spirits. Hark! hark! The watch-dogs bark: Hark! hark! I hear The strain of Chanticleer. Enter Ferdinand, with his Sword drawn.—Ariel and the other Spirits are invisible to him. Fer. Where should this music be? I'the air, or the earth? It sounds no more:—and sure, it waits upon Some god o'th' island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father's wreck, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury, and my passion, With its sweet air; thence I have follow'd it, Or it hath drawn me rather:—But 'tis gone— [Music. No, it begins again— SONG—BY ARIEL. Full fathom five, thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that does fade, But doth suffer a sea-change, Into something rich and strange. Chorus of Spirits. Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell; Hark! now I hear them,—ding-dong, bell. Fer. This ditty does remember my drown'd father:— This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes. [Ariel waves Ferdinand after him. Chorus of Spirits. Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell; Hark! now I hear them,—ding-dong, bell. [Exeunt.</field>

Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell; Hark! now I hear them,—ding-dong, bell. [While they are singing, Enter Prospero and Miranda. Pro. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance, And say, what thou see'st yond'. Mir. What is't, a spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form:—But 'tis a spirit? Pro. No, wench; it eats, and sleeps, and hath such senses As we have, such: This gallant, which thou seest, Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd With grief, that's beauty's canker, thou might'st call him A goodly person. Enter Ariel, waving Ferdinand after him, followed by other Spirits. Mir. I might call him A thing divine; for nothing natural I ever saw so noble. Pro. It goes on, As my soul prompts it:—Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee Within two days for this. Fer. Most sure, the goddess, On whom these airs attend!—Vouchsafe my prayer May know, if you remain upon this island; And that you will some good instruction give, How I may bear me here: My prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is,—O you wonder!— If you be maid, or no? Mir. No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid. Fer. My language!—Heavens!— I am the best of them, that speak this speech, Were I but where 'tis spoken. Pro. How! the best? What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? Fer. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples: He does hear me; And, that he does, I weep: myself am Naples; Who, with mine eyes, ne'er since at ebb, beheld The king, my father, wreck'd. Mir. Alack, for mercy! Fer. Yes, faith, and all his lords. Pro. At the first sight They have chang'd eyes:—Delicate Ariel, I'll set thee free for this!—A word, good sir; I fear, you have done yourself some wrong.—Attend— [Prospero talks apart to Ariel. Mir. Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that I e'er saw; the first That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father To be inclin'd my way! Fer. O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you The Queen of Naples. Pro. Soft, sir; one word more.— They are both in either's power: but this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light.—One word more—I charge thee, That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp Upon this island, as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on't. Fer. No, as I am a man. Mir. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with't. Pro. Follow me,— Speak not you for him; he's a traitor.—Come, I'll manacle thy neck and feet together; Sea water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be, The fresh brook muscles, wither'd roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled;—Follow. Fer. No; I will resist such entertainment, till Mine enemy has more power. [He draws his Sword. Pro. Put thy sword up, traitor: Who mak'st a show, but dar'st not strike, thy conscience Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward; For I can here disarm thee with this stick, And make thy weapon drop. [Ferdinand drops his Point to the Ground. Mir. Beseech you, father! Pro. Hence; hang not on my garments. Mir. Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety. Pro. Silence! one word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! My foot my tutor?—Hush!—Come on, obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again, And have no vigour in them. Fer. So they are: My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, The wreck of all my friends, or this man's threats, To whom I am subdu'd, were but light to me Might I but through my prison, once a day, Behold this maid: all corners else o'the earth Let liberty make use of; space enough Have I in such a prison. Pro. It works:—Come on.— Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!—Follow me.— Hark, what thou else shalt do me. [Prospero talks apart to Ariel. Mir. Be of comfort; My father's of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech: ne'er, till this day, Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd. Pro. Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds:—but then exactly do All points of my command. Ari. To the syllable. Pro. Come, follow:—speak not for him.

Kind fortune smiles, and she Hath yet in store for thee, Some strange felicity: Follow me, follow me, And thou shalt see. Chorus of Spirits. Follow me, follow me, And thou shalt see. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An open Part of the Island. Enter Trinculo, Caliban, and Stephano, with a Keg. Step. Tell not me;—when the butt is out, we will drink water; not a drop before: therefore, bear up, and board 'em:—Servant Monster, drink to me:— Why, thy eyes are almost set in thy head. Trin. Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. Step. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack: Thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. Trin. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard. Step. Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou be'st a good mooncalf. Cal. How does thy honour? let me lick thy shoe: I'll not serve him, he is not valiant. Trin. Thou ly'st, most ignorant monster; why, thou debosh'd fish thou, was there ever a man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? Cal. Lo, how he mocks me!—Wilt thou let him, my lord? Trin. Lord, quoth he!—O lord, O lord, that a monster should be such a natural! Cal. Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I pr'ythee. Step. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head, if you prove a mutineer, the next tree—The poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity. Cal. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made thee? Step. Marry will I: kneel and repeat it: I will stand, and so shall Trinculo. [Caliban kneels. Enter Ariel, invisible to them, with a Tabor and Pipe. Cal. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of this island. Ari. Thou ly'st. Cal. Thou ly'st, thou jesting monkey, thou;— [Rises. I would, my valiant master would destroy thee; I do not lie. Step. Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth. Trin. Why, I said nothing. Step. Mum then, and no more.—Proceed. Cal. I say, by sorcery he got this isle; From me he got it. If thy greatness will Revenge it on him,—for, I know, thou dar'st,— I'll yield him thee asleep, Where thou may'st knock a nail into his head. Ari. Thou ly'st, thou canst not. Cal. What a py'd ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch! I do beseech thy greatness give him blows. Step. Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out of doors, and make a stockfish of thee. Trin. Why, what did I? I did nothing; I'll go further off. Step. Did'st thou not say, he ly'd? Ari. Thou ly'st. Step. Do I so? take thou that. [Strikes Trinculo.—Caliban laughs. As you like this, give me the lie another time. Trin. You lie, I did not give you the lie:—Out o'your wits, and hearing too?—A plague o'your bottle! this can sack and drinking do.—A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! Cal. Ha! ha! ha! Step. Now forward with your tale.—Pr'ythee, stand further off. Cal. Beat him enough: After a little time, I'll beat him too. Step. Stand further.—Come, proceed. Cal. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him I'the afternoon to sleep: there thou may'st brain him, Having first seiz'd his books; or with a log Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, Or cut his weazand with thy knife: Remember, First to possess his books; for, without them, He's but a sot, as I am; nor hath not One spirit to command: They all do hate him, As rootedly as I. Step. Monster, I will kill this man, and be myself king of the island. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? Trin. Stephano, hear me: I will speak for the people, because there are none in the island to speak for themselves.—Know then, we are all content, that Stephano shall be king, on condition I may be viceroy over him. Speak, good people, are you agreed? What, no man answer? Then, we may take their silence for consent. Step. Give me thy hand.—I am sorry I beat thee: but, while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy head. Cal. Within this half hour will he be asleep; Wilt thou destroy him then? Step. Ay, on mine honour. Ari. This will I tell my master. [Exit Ariel. Cal. Thou mak'st me merry: I am full of pleasure; Let us be jocund: Will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere? Step. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason: Come on, Trinculo, let us sing. They sing and dance. Flout 'em, and skout 'em; And skout 'em, and flout 'em; Thought is free. [Ariel plays on the Tabor and Pipe without. Cal. That's not the tune. Step. What is this same? Trin. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of nobody. Step. If thou be'st a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou be'st a devil, take't as thou list. [Ariel plays again. Trin. O, forgive me my sins! [Falls on his Knees. Step. He that dies, pays all debts:—I defy thee. [Ariel plays again. Mercy upon us! [Falls on his Knees. Cal. Art thou afeard? Step. No, monster, not I. Cal. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. [Stephano and Trinculo rise. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices, That, if I then had wak'd after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds, methought, would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I wak'd, I cry'd to dream again. Step. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing. Cal. When Prospero is destroy'd. Step. That shall be by and by: I remember the story. [Ariel plays again at some Distance; and continues to do so, retiring more and more, till the End of the Scene. Trin. The sound is going away: let's follow it, and after do our work. Step. Lead, monster; we'll follow.—I would, I could see this taborer: he lays it on.—Wilt come? Trin. I'll follow, Stephano. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Grove behind the Cell of Prospero. Enter Miranda and Prospero. Pro. Your suit has pity in't, and has prevail'd. But yet take heed; let prudence be your guide: You must not stay, your visit must be short.— One thing I had forgot; insinuate into his mind A kindness to that youth, whom first you saw; I would have friendship grow between them. Mir. You shall be obey'd in all things. Pro. Be earnest to unite their very souls. Mir. I shall endeavour it. Pro. This may secure Hippolyto From that dark danger which my heart forebodes; For friendship does provide a double strength To oppose the assaults of fortune. See, he comes:— Remember. [Exit Prospero. Enter Ferdinand, bearing a Log. Mir. Alas, now! 'pray you, Work not so hard; I would, the lightning had Burnt up those logs, that you are enjoin'd to pile! 'Pray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns, 'Twill weep for having weary'd you: My father Is gone to study; 'pray now, rest yourself. Fer. O, most dear mistress, The sun will set, before I shall discharge What I must strive to do. Mir. If you'll sit down, I'll bear your logs the while: 'Pray, give me that; I'll carry it to the pile. Fer. No, precious creature: I had rather crack my sinews, Than you should such dishonour undergo, While I sit lazy by. Mir. Why, I should do it With much more ease; for my good will is to it, And yours it is against.—You look wearily. Fer. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me, When you are by at night. I do beseech you, (Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,) What is your name? Mir. Miranda:—O, my father, I have broke your hest to say so! Fer. Admir'd Miranda!— Indeed, the top of admiration; worth What's dearest to the world!—Full many a lady I've ey'd with best regard; and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I lik'd several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd, And put it to the foil: But you, O you, So perfect, and so peerless, are created Of every creature's best. Mir. I would not wish Any companion in the world but you:— I prattle wildly, and my father's precepts Therein I do forget. Fer. Hear my soul speak;— The very instant, that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient logman. Mir. Do you love me? Fer. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound, And crown what I profess with kind event, If I speak true; if hollowly, invert What best is boded me, to mischief! I, Beyond all limit of what else i'the world, Do love, prize, honour you. Mir. I am a fool, To weep at what I'm glad of. Fer. Wherefore weep you? Mir. At mine unworthiness.—Hence, bashful cunning! And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! I am your wife, if you will marry me; If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow You may deny me; but I'll be your servant, Whether you will or no. Fer. My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever. Mir. My husband then? Fer. Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand. Mir. And mine, with my heart in't.— Now, I've a suit to you, and I shall make it The only trial of your love to me. Fer. You've said enough, never to be deny'd, Were it my life. Mir. For my sake to love one, sir, Who, for his own, indeed, does well deserve All the respect that you can ever pay him. Fer. Is there another whom I ought to love, And love him for your sake? Mir. Yes; such a one, As, for his sweetness, and his goodly shape, (If I who am unskill'd in forms may judge,) Can scarce be match'd: my sister thinks so too, My dear Dorinda. Fer. Have you a sister? Mir. Yes; she loves him too: Come, you must love him for my sake: you shall. Fer. Must I for yours, and cannot for my own? Since you would have me love him, I must hate him. Mir. Have I so far offended you already, That he offends you only for my sake? Yet, sure, you would not hate him if you saw him As I have done, so fresh in youth and beauty. Fer. O poison to my hopes! Mir. Alas! what mean you?— Hark! hark! I hear my father's step:—farewell!— Here comes the youth:—I fear, I've stay'd too long. [Exit Miranda. Fer. Too long indeed; and yet not long enough. Enter Hippolyto. Sir, well encounter'd; you're the happy man; You've got the hearts of both the beauteous women. Hip. How, sir, I pray you? Are you sure of that? Fer. You know, Dorinda loves you; and Miranda charg'd me love you for her sake. Hip. Then I must have her. Fer. Not till I am dead. Hip. How dead? What's that? But whatsoe'er it be, I long to have her. Fer. Wait a little while; Time and my grief may make me shortly die. Hip. I beg that you'll make haste then; for, to tell you A secret, sir, which I have lately found Within myself,—they are all made for me. Fer. That's but a fond conceit: you're made for one, And one for you. Hip. You cannot tell me, sir; I know, I'm made for twenty hundred women, (I mean, if there so many be i'the world,) So that, if once I see her, I shall love her. Fer. I find, I must not let you see her then. Hip. How will you hinder me? Fer. By force of arms: Provide yourself a sword; for we must fight. Hip. A sword,—what's that? Fer. A weapon such as this. [Draws his Sword. Hip. What should I do with it? Fer. You must stand thus, And aim at me, till one of us fall dead. Hip. But we have no swords growing in our world. Fer. What shall we do then to decide our quarrel? Hip. We'll take the sword by turns, and fight with it. Fer. Strange ignorance!—You must defend your life, And so must I.—But, since you have no sword, Take this; for in a corner of my cave I now remember that I saw another.— [Gives Hippolyto the Sword. When next we meet, prepare yourself to fight. Hip. Make haste then; this shall ne'er be yours again: I mean to fight with all the men I meet, And when they're dead, their women shall be mine. Fer. I see you are unskilful; I desire not To take your life; but, if you please, we'll fight On these conditions;—he, who first draws blood, Shall be acknowledg'd as the conqueror, And both the women shall be his. Hip. Agreed: And ev'ry day I'll fight for two more with you. Fer. But win these first. Hip. Make haste, and find your sword. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A rocky, mountainous, Part of the Island. Enter Antonio, Alonzo, and Gonzalo. Gon. 'Beseech you, sir, be merry: you have cause, So have we all, of joy; for our escape Is much beyond our loss: then wisely weigh Our sorrow with our comfort. Alon. Peace, Gonzalo. Ant. But the rarity of it is, (which is, indeed, almost beyond credit,) our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, are, notwithstanding, as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of your fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. Alon. You cram these words into mine ears, against The stomach of my sense. 'Would I had never Marry'd my daughter there! for coming thence, My Ferdinand is lost. Gon. Sir, he may live; I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs; I do not doubt, He came alive to land. Alon. No, no, he's gone: And thou and I, Antonio,—thou and I!— Have caus'd his death. Ant. How could we help it, sir? Alon. How help it? Then we should have help'd it, then, When thou betray'dst thy brother Prospero, And gav'st the infant sovereign of Mantua Into my power; then lost we Ferdinand, Then forfeited our navy to this tempest.— E'en here do I put off all hope: he's drown'd, Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land. [Music. What harmony is this? My good friends, hark! Gon. Marvellous sweet music! Enter Ariel and Three other Spirits: while Ariel sings the following Song, a Banquet presents itself, and the other Spirits, having danced about it with gentle Actions of Salutation, and invited the King and his Followers to eat, are led away by Ariel. SONG—BY ARIEL. Dry those eyes, which are o'erflowing; All your storms are overblowing: While you in this isle are biding, You shall feast without providing; Every dainty you can think of, Every juice which you would drink of, Shall be yours,—all want shall shun you, Ceres' blessing so is on you. [Exeunt Ariel and the other Spirits, dancing fantastically. Alon, Give us kind keepers, Heav'ns!—What were these? Ant. They vanish'd strangely. Gon. No matter, since They've left their viands behind; for we have stomachs. Will't please you taste of what is here? Alon. Not I. Gon. Well, sir, I will; for I am hungry: The devil may fright me, but he shall not starve me. Alon. I will stand to, and feed, although my last: No matter, since I feel the best is past. [Sounds of discordant Instruments.—Three Spirits, in the Shape of Harpies, descend on the Table, and vanish with it, amidst Flames and Groans. A Voice from below. You men of sin, whom destiny hath caus'd The never-surfeited sea to cast up, And on this isle, where man doth not inhabit,— You amongst men being most unfit to live, Remember Prospero. [Thunder and Lightning. Alon. 'Tis monstrous! monstrous! Methought, the billows spoke, and told me of it; The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder Pronounc'd the name of Prospero. Ant. This isle's enchanted ground; for I have heard Swift voices flying by my ear, and groans Of ghosts lamenting. Alon. Good Heaven deliver me from this dire place, And all the after actions of my life Shall mark my penitence!—Lead from this spot. [It suddenly grows dark.—Thunder and Lightning. —Several Furies rise. The Furies sing. 1 Fury. Where does the black fiend Ambition reside, With the mischievous devil of Pride? 2 Fury. In the lowest and darkest cavern of hell, Both Pride and Ambition do dwell. 1 Fury. Who are the chief leaders of the damn'd host? 2 Fury. Proud monarchs who tyrannize most. Four Furies. In hell, in hell, in flames they shall reign, And for ever and ever shall suffer the pain. Chorus of Furies, while others surround Alonzo and his Followers. In hell, in hell, in flames they shall reign, And for ever and ever shall suffer the pain. [Thunder and Lightning.—Exeunt, pursued by the Furies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE I. The Cell of Prospero. Prospero discovered reading.—He rises suddenly. Pro. I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates, Against my life; the minute of their plot Is almost come.— What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! Enter Ariel. Ari. Thy thoughts I cleave to; what's thy pleasure? Pro. Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban. Ari. Ay, my commander. Pro. Where didst thou leave these varlets? Ari. They were red hot with drinking, mighty sir; So full of valour, that they smote the air, For breathing in their faces; beat the ground, For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project:—so I charm'd their ears, That, calf-like, they my lowing follow'd through Tooth'd briars, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns, Which enter'd their frail skins:—at last, I left them I'the filthy mantled pool beside the marsh. Pro. Thy shape invisible retain thou still. Thou and thy meaner followers your last service Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick: go, call the spirits, O'er whom I gave thee power, quick to this place, And let them bring the trumpery in my cave, For stale to catch these thieves. Ari. Presently? Pro. Ay, with a twink. [Exit Ariel. O, this Caliban!— A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, are all lost, quite lost; And as, with age, his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers.—I will plague them all, Even to roaring. Enter Ariel and other Spirits, with Garments. Come, hang them on this line. [Exeunt Prospero, Ariel, and the other Spirits. Enter Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano, all wet. Cal. 'Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not Hear a foot fall: we now are at his cell. Step. Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the jack with us. Trin. Monster, I do smell all horsepond; at which my nose is in great indignation. Step. So is mine.—Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you; look you— Trin. Thou wert but a lost monster. Cal. Good my lord, give me thy favour still; Be patient; for the prize I'll bring thee to, Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore, speak softly: All's hush'd as midnight yet. SONG—BY CALIBAN. The owl is abroad, The bat and the toad, And so is the cat-a-mountain The ant and the mole, Sit both in a hole, And frog peeps out of the fountain. Trin. Ay, but to lose our bottle in the pool— Step. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss. Trin. That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster. Step. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour. [Going. Cal. 'Pr'ythee, my king, be quiet:—see'st thou here, This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter: Do that good mischief, which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot licker. Step. Give me thy hand: I do begin to have bloody thoughts. Trin. O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! —Look, what a wardrobe here is for thee! Cal. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash. Trin. O, ho, monster, we know what belongs to a frippery;—O, King Stephano! Step. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have that gown. Trin. Thy grace shall have it. Cal. The dropsy drown this fool!—What do you mean, To doat thus on such luggage? Let it alone, And do the murder first:—if he awake, From crown to toe he'll fill our skins with pinches; Make us strange stuff. Step. Be you quiet, monster. Trin. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest. Cal. I will have none on't: we shall lose our time, And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes, With foreheads villanous low. Step. Monster, lay to your fingers; help to bear this away, where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out of my kingdom: go to, carry this. Trin. And this. Step. Ay, and this. [Horns, and a Noise of Hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in monstrous Shapes of Hounds, with Prospero, Ariel, and Two other Spirits, setting them on Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban. Pro. Hey, Mountain, hey! Ari. Silver! there it goes, Silver! Pro. Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant! there! hark, hark! [Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, roaring are driven away. Go, charge my goblins, that they grind their joints With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews With aged cramps; and more pinch-spotted make them, Than pard, or cat-o'-mountain. [Exeunt the Two Spirits.—Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo roar without. Ari. Hark, they roar. Pro. Let them be hunted soundly.—For a little, Follow, and do me service. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Inside of the Cave of Hippolyto. Enter Ferdinand and Hippolyto, with drawn Swords. Fer. Come, sir, your cave affords no choice of place; But the ground's firm and even: are you ready? Hip. As ready as yourself, sir. Fer. You remember On what conditions we must fight:—who first Receives a wound, is to submit. Hip. Come, come, This loses time: now for the women, sir. [They fight—Ferdinand touches him. Fer. Sir, you are wounded. Hip. No. Fer. Believe your blood. Hip. I feel no hurt; no matter for my blood. Fer. Nay, but remember our conditions, sir. Hip. I will not leave, till my sword hits you too. [Hippolyto presses on—Ferdinand retires, and wards. Fer. I'm loath to kill you: you're unskilful, sir. Hip. You beat aside my sword; but let it come As near as yours, and you shall see my skill. Fer. You faint for loss of blood; I see you stagger: 'Pray, sir, retire. Hip. No, I will ne'er go back,— Methinks, the cave turns round,—I cannot find— Why do you swim, and dance about me? Stand still, till I have made one thrust.— [Thrusts and falls. Fer. O help! Help, help!—Unhappy man! what have I done? Hip. I'm going to a cold sleep; but, when I wake, I'll fight again:—'Pray stay for me. [Swoons. Fer. He's gone, He's gone!—O stay, sweet, lovely youth! Help! help!— Enter Prospero. Pro. What dismal noise is that? Fer. O see, sir, see, What mischief my unlucky hand hath wrought. Pro. Alas, how much in vain doth feeble art Endeavour to resist the will of Heaven! He's gone for ever!—O, thou cruel son Of an inhuman father! All my plans Are ruin'd and unravell'd by this blow: No pleasure now is left me, but revenge. Fer. Sir, if you knew my innocence,— Pro. Peace, peace! Can thy excuses give me back his life?— What, Ariel! sluggish spirit, where, where art thou? Enter Ariel. Ari. Here, at thy beck, my lord. Pro. Ay, now thou com'st, When fate is past, and not to be recall'd. Look there, and glut the malice of thy nature; For, as thou art thyself, thou canst not but Be glad to see young virtue nipt i'the blossom. Ari. My lord, the Being high above can witness, I am not glad. Pro. Why didst thou not prevent, at least foretel, This fatal action then? Ari. Pardon, great sir, I meant to do it; but I was forbidden By the ill genius of Hippolyto, Who came and threaten'd me, if I disclos'd it, To bind me in the bottom of the sea, Far from the lightsome regions of the air, My native fields, above a hundred years. Pro. I'll chain thee in the north for thy neglect, Within the burning bowels of mount Hecla; I'll singe thy airy wings with sulphurous flames, And choke thy tender nostrils with blue smoke; At every hickup of the belching mountain, Thou shalt be lifted up to taste fresh air, And then fall down again. Ari. Pardon, dread lord! Pro. No more of pardon than just Heaven intends thee, Shalt thou e'er find from me.—Hence; fly with speed; Unbind the charm which holds this murderer's father, And bring him with his followers straight before me. [Exit Ariel. Fer. O Heavens! what words were those I heard, Yet cannot see who spoke them? Sure, the nymph I lov'd was, like to this, some airy vision. Pro. No, murderer, she's, like thee, of mortal mould; But much too pure to mix with thy black crimes.— Miranda and Dorinda,—come,—where are ye? The will of Heaven's accomplish'd: I have now No more to fear, and nothing left to hope:— Now you may enter. Enter Miranda and Dorinda. Mir. My love! is it permitted me to see You once again? Pro. You come to look your last; I will for ever take him from your eyes.— Nay, on my blessing, speak not, nor approach him. Dor. 'Pray, father, is not this my sister's man? He has a noble form; but yet he's not So excellent as my Hippolyto. Pro. Alas, poor girl, thou hast no man! Look yonder, There's all of him that's left. Dor. Why, was there ever any more of him? He lies asleep, sir; shall I waken him? [She kneels by Hippolyto, and tries to waken him. Fer. Alas, he's never to be wak'd again! Dor. My love, my love?—Will not you speak to me? I fear you have displeas'd him, sir, and now He will not answer me:—he's dumb,—and cold too;— But I'll run straight, and make a fire to warm him. [Exit Dorinda. Enter Ariel, Alonzo, Gonzalo, and Antonio. Alon. Never were beasts so hunted into toils, As we have been pursu'd by dreadful shapes.— Speak, is not that my son? Fer. My honour'd father!— Alon. O Ferdinand! [Running to embrace him. Pro. There stand; for you are spell stopp'd.— How now, sirs? You gaze upon me, as you ne'er had seen me: Have fifteen years so lost me to your knowledge, That you retain no memory of Prospero? Gon. The good old Duke of Milan! Pro. I wonder less, That thou, Antonio, know'st me not, because Thou did'st long since forget I was thy brother; Else had I ne'er been here. Ant. Shame chokes my words. Alon. And wonder mine. Pro. For you, usurping prince, Know, by my art you were shipwreck'd on this isle; Where, after I a while had punish'd you, My vengeance would have ended; I design'd To match that son of yours, with this my daughter. Alon. Pursue it still; I am most willing to it. Pro. So am not I. No marriages can prosper Which are with murderers made:—Look on that corse: This, while he liv'd, was Prince Hippolyto, The rightful Duke of Mantua, sir, whom you, Having depriv'd him of his inheritance, Expos'd with me; and whom I here bred up, Till that bloodthirsty man, that Ferdinand— But why do I exclaim on him, when justice Calls to unsheathe her sword against his guilt? Alon. What do you mean? Pro. To execute Heaven's laws:— Here I am plac'd by Heaven, here I am prince, Though you have dispossess'd me of my Milan:— Blood calls for blood; your Ferdinand shall die; And I, in bitterness, have sent for you, To have the joy of seeing him alive, And then the greater grief to see him die. Alon. And think'st thou I, or these, will tamely stand To view the execution? [Lays his Hand upon his Sword. Pro. Nay,—appear, My guards,— [He waves his Wand, and a Troop of Furies enters. I thought, no more to use their aid; But they are now the ministers of Heaven, While I revenge this murder.— This night I will allow you, Ferdinand, To fit you for your death: that cave's your prison. Alon. Ah, Prospero, hear me speak: You are a father: Feel for a father then, and spare my son. Mir. O, pity, pity— Pro. You implore in vain; I have no room for pity left within me.— Do you refuse?—Help, Ariel, with your followers; Drive them in. [Ariel and the Furies force them into an inner Cave. Enter Dorinda. Dor. Sir, I have made a fire; shall he be warm'd? Pro. He's dead, and vital warmth will ne'er return. Dor. Dead, sir! what's that? Pro. His soul has left his body. Dor. When will it come again? Pro. O, never, never! He must be laid in earth, and there consume. Dor. He shall not lie in earth: You do not know How well he loves me: indeed, he'll come again; He told me he would go a little while, But promis'd me he would not tarry long. Pro. He's murder'd by the man who lov'd your sister. Now both of you may learn what 'tis to break A parent's precept: you would needs see men, And, by that sight, are made for ever wretched: Hippolyto is dead, and Ferdinand Must die for murdering him.—Get you to bed.— Your disobedience has so much incens'd me, That I this night can leave no blessing with you. [Exit Prospero. Mir. I must say, sister, it was long of you That all this mischief happen'd. Dor. Blame not me For your own fault; your curiosity Brought me to see the man. Mir. You safely might Have seen him, and retir'd; but you would needs Go near him, and converse:—You may remember, My father call'd me thence, and I call'd you. Dor. You call'd me thence, because you could not be Alone with him yourself:—But, I am sure, My man had never gone to heaven so soon, But that yours made him go. Mir. I could not wish, that either of them should Have gone to heaven without us; but it was His fortune, and you must be satisfy'd. Dor. I'll not be satisfy'd: perhaps, you think, 'Tis nothing to lose a man. Mir. Yes; but there is Some difference between my Ferdinand, And your Hippolyto. Dor. Ay, there's your judgment: Yours is the oldest man I ever saw, Except my father. Mir. Sister, I'll never sleep with you again. Dor. I'll never more meet in a bed with you; But lodge on the bare ground, and mourn my love: Just at the entrance of his cave I'll lie, And echo to each blast of wind a sigh. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE I. A Grove behind the Cell of Prospero. Enter Prospero and Miranda. Pro. You beg in vain; I cannot pardon him; He has offended Heaven. Mir. Then let Heaven punish him. Pro. It will, by me. Mir. Grant him at least some respite, for my sake. Pro. I, by deferring justice, should incense The Deity against myself and you. Mir. Yet I have heard you say, the powers above Are slow in punishing,—and should not you Resemble them?— And can you be his judge and executioner? Pro. I cannot force Gonzalo, or my brother, Much less the father, to destroy the son; It must be then the monster Caliban; And he's not here: but Ariel straight shall fetch him. Enter Ariel, with a small Box of Unguent, and Ferdinand's Sword, wrapped up in a Scarf. Ari. My potent lord, before thou call'st, I come To serve thy will. Pro. Then, spirit, fetch me hither My savage slave. Ari. My lord, it does not need. Pro. Art thou then prone to mischief? Wilt thou be Thyself the executioner? Ari. Think better of thy airy minister, Who, for thy sake, unbidden, this night hath flown O'er almost all the habitable world. Pro. But to what purpose was thy diligence? Ari. When I was chidden by my mighty lord, For my neglect of young Hippolyto, I search'd his wound with care, and found that life Was but retir'd, not sally'd out: I gather'd The best of simples underneath the moon, The best of balms, and to the hurt apply'd The healing juice of vulnerary herbs: His only danger was his loss of blood, Just at this hour he will awake, and now He must be dress'd again: anoint this sword, Which pierc'd him, with this salve, and wrap it close From air, at once his cure will be complete. Pro. Give them to me: Be this your task, Miranda, Because your sister is not present here; [Gives her the Sword and Box. While I go visit your dear Ferdinand. Mir. I do obey you with a double duty; For now, sir, you have given me life twice over. [Exit Miranda. Pro. Now does my project gather to a head: My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time Goes upright with his carriage: at this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies. Tell me, my spirit, how fares Prince Ferdinand, The King, and his followers? Ari. Confin'd together In the same fashion as you gave in charge: Your brother, and the King, abide distracted; And young Prince Ferdinand mourning over them, Brim-full of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly, Him that you term'd “The good old Lord Gonzalo,— His tears run down his beard, like winter drops From eaves of reeds: Your charm so strongly works 'em That, if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. Pro. Dost thou think so, spirit? Ari. Mine would, sir, were I human. Pro. And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions? And shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick, Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury Will I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Follow, gentle Ariel. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Inside of the Cave of Hippolyto. Hippolyto on a Couch, and Dorinda by him, discovered. Dor. How do you find yourself? Hip. I'm somewhat cold: Can you not draw me nearer to the sun? I am too weak to walk. Dor. My love, I'll try. [She draws the Couch forward. They told me, you had died, and were asleep, Never to wake again:—What is't to die? Hip. Sure 'tis a dream, a kind of breathless swoon, When once the soul's gone out. Dor. What is the soul? Hip. A small blue thing, that runs about within us. Dor. Then I have seen it in a frosty morning Run smoking from my mouth. Hip. But, dear Dorinda, What is become of him, who fought with me? Dor. O, I can tell you joyful news of him: My father means to make him die to-day, For what he did to you. Hip. That must not be: My dear Dorinda, go, and beg your father He may not die; it was my fault he hurt me; I urg'd him to it first: he must forgive him. Dor. But then he'll ne'er leave killing you, perhaps. Hip. Nay, but run quickly, lest you come too late. [Exit Dorinda. Enter Miranda, with the Sword and Box. Hip. Who's this, who looks so fair and beautiful, As nothing but Dorinda can surpass her? O, I believe, it is that angel woman Whom she calls sister. Mir. Sir, I am sent hither To dress your wound:—How do you find your strength? Hip. Fair creature, I am faint with loss of blood.— [She uncovers the Sword. My wound shoots worse than ever.— [She anoints the Sword. Mir. Do you find No ease? Hip. Yes:—on the sudden all the pain Is leaving me.— [She wraps the Sword up again. Sweet Heaven, how I'm reliev'd! [Rises. Enter Ferdinand and Dorinda. Fer. Madam, I must confess, my life is yours, I owe it to your goodness. Mir. Ha! her goodness? Fer. Look;—is not that your sister with Hippolyto? Dor. It is. Hip. Dorinda with another man! Dor. Sister, what business have you here? Mir. You see. [Showing the Sword and Scarf. I come to wait upon Hippolyto. Dor. You are very charitable to a stranger. Mir. And you, Dorinda, are not much behind In charity, to beg a pardon for A man whom you scarce ever saw before. Dor. Henceforward let your surgery alone; I'd rather he should die, than you should cure His wound. Mir. And I wish Ferdinand had died, [Throws away the Sword, &amp;c. Before he ow'd his life to your entreaty. Fer. Sir, I am glad you are so well recover'd. You keep your humour still, to have all women. Hip. Not all, sir; you except one of the number, Your new love there, Dorinda. Mir. Ah, Ferdinand, can you become inconstant? Dor. Ay, now I find why I was sent away; That you might have my sister's company. Hip. Dorinda, kill me not with your unkindness; This is too much, first to be false yourself, And then accuse me too. Fer. We all accuse Each other, and each one denies the guilt: I should be glad it were a mutual error; And therefore, first to clear myself from fault, I beg Dorinda's pardon, while I say, I only love her sister. Mir. O bless'd word! I'm sure, I love no man but Ferdinand. Dor. Nor I, Heaven knows, but my Hippolyto. Hip. I never knew how much I lov'd, before I fear'd Dorinda's constancy; but now I am convinc'd that I lov'd none but her, Because none else can recompense her loss.— Look, look,—what goodly creatures are there here! Mir. How beauteous mankind is! Dor. O brave new world, That has such wonders in't! Fer. Our friends and fathers. Enter Ariel, Prospero, Alonso, Gonzalo, and Antonio. Alon. I do entreat, it may no more be thought of: Your purpose, though it was severe, was just: In losing Ferdinand, I should have mourn'd, But could not have complain'd. Pro. Sir, I rejoice, Kind Heaven decreed it otherwise.—My spirit, Set Caliban and his companions free; Untie the spell; enforce them to this place, And presently. Ari. I drink the air before me. [Exit Ariel. Pro. [To Ferdinand.] If I have too austerely punish'd you, Your compensation makes amends; for I Do give you here a third of my own life: I tender her to thy hand, and afore Heaven Do ratify this my rich gift: O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me, that I boast her off; For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise, And make it halt behind her. For. I do believe it, Against an oracle. Alon. Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about, And make thee happy in thy beauteous choice! But,—O,—how oddly will it sound, that I Must ask my child forgiveness! Pro. There, sir, stop; Let us not burden our remembrance with A heaviness that's gone. Gon. I've inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you Heavens, And on this couple drop a blessed crown: For it is you, that have chalk'd forth the way Which brought us hither! Pro. I say, amen to that. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, My true preserver, I will pay thy graces Home, both in word and deed. Ant. [Kneels.] My brother, and my liege, though penitence, Forc'd by necessity, be of little worth, Yet let me hope my blood may somewhat plead For mercy in your bosom:—I resign Dominion, which 'tis true, I could not keep; But Heaven knows too, I would not. Pro. [Raises him.] All past griefs I bury in the joy of this bless'd day. [Embraces him. Alon. There is yet an act of justice due from me: To you, young prince, I render back your own, And as the Duke of Mantua thus salute you. Hip. What is it that you render back? Methinks, You give me nothing. Pro. You are to be lord Of a great people, and o'er towns and cities. Hip. And shall these people all be men and women? Pro. They shall, Hippolyto; and call you lord: And that your happiness may be complete, I give you my Dorinda for your wife; She shall be yours for ever, when the priest Has made you one. Hip. How can he make us one? Pro. By saying holy words, you shall be join'd In marriage to each other. Dor. O, I'll tell you; I warrant you, these holy words are charms; My father means to conjure us together. Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban without. Cal. O! O! O! Step. Most villanous monster! Trin. Most monstrous monster! Gon. O, look, sir: here are more of us! I prophesy'd, if a gallows were on land, That fellow could not drown. Enter Ariel, waving Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban, after him. Step. [Entering.] Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Ant. Is not this Stephano, our drunken master. Trin. [Entering with Caliban.] Oh! a plague o' your monsters! Alon. And Trinculo, our jester? Gon. Now, blasphemy, That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore? Hast thou no mouth by land? Cal. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! Gon. How came you in this pickle, Trinculo? Trin. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last, That, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I Shall not fear fly-blowing. Gon. Why, how now, Stephano? Step. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp. Pro. You would be king of the isle, sirrah? Step. I should have been a sore one then. Cal. My master! O, I shall be pinch'd to death. Alon. This is as strange a sight as e'er I look'd on. Pro. This misshapen thing,— His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could controll the moon, make flows and ebbs, And deal in her command without her power. He is as disproportioned in his manners, As in his shape.— These three have robb'd me; and have plotted too To take my life. Hence, malice, to my cell; Take with you your companions; as you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely. Cal. Ay, that I will;—and I'll be wise hereafter, And seek for grace.—What a thrice double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool! Ho! ho! ho! [Exit Caliban. Step. I would I had now our gallant ship again, and were her master! I would willingly give all my island for her. Trin. She and our bottle are past praying for. Pro. Follow that slave: be of good heart; your ship, Which, but some few hours since, you gave out split, Is tight and yare; and bravely rigg'd, as when You first put out to sea. Step. Trinculo, if this news be true, I resign my kingdom. Trin. And I my viceroyship over you. Pro. You'll find it verity:—away, be gone. Step. Huzza, Trinculo! Trin. Huzza, Stephano! Step. and Trin. Huzza! Huzza! [Exeunt Trinculo and Stephano. Ari. Was this well done? Pro. Bravely, my Ariel.—I shall miss thee much; Yet take thy liberty, my chick;—and now, Away, and to the elements be free:— Farewell! Ari. My ever gracious master, thanks. SONG—BY ARIEL. Where the bee sucks, there suck I; In a cowslip's bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry; On the bat's back I do fly After summer merrily.— Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. [Exit Ariel. Pro. Sir, I invite your highness, and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest This night; and learn the story of my life, Since I came to this isle; soon in the morn, I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples;— Where I have hope to see the nuptials Of these our dear beloved solemnized;— And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave. Alon. I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely. Pro. I'll deliver all: And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales, With sail so expeditious, that shall catch Your royal fleet far off.—And when I have Requir'd one airy vision of my spirits,— Which even now I do,—I'll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound, I'll drown my book. [Prospero waves his Wand,—the Scene vanishes, and discovers a View of a calm Sea, and the King's Ship riding at Anchor. Where art thou, Ariel? Come; For the last time obey. Ari. [From the Sky.] Hail, Prospero, hail! Pro. Approach, descend; be visible to all. [Ariel and other Spirits descend in bright Clouds. Ari. I come, best master; And, for the freedom I enjoy in air, I will be still your Ariel, and wait On all the accidents that work for fate; Whatever may your happiness concern From your still faithful Ariel you shall learn. Quartetto and Chorus, by Ariel and the Spirits. Where the bee sucks, there suck I; In a cowslip's bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry: On the bat's back I do fly After summer merrily.— Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. [Ariel and the Spirits reascend into the Sky. Pro. Farewell my much lov'd Ariel: thou shalt find I will retain thee ever in my mind.— You look in a mov'd sort, [To Alonso. As if you were dismay'd; be cheerful, sir: Our revels are now ended: these our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve; And, like this unsubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind.—My work is done. [Breaks his Wand. Henceforth this land to the afflicted be A place of refuge, as it was to me: On my retreat, let Heaven and nature smile, And ever flourish the Enchanted Isle! [Exeunt Omnes.
