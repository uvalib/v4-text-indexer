      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. Scena prima. Enter Duke, Julia, Rosania, Hippolyto, with Attendants, and Flourish. Duk. Wee'l hear no more in his defence: Did not our cousen's speedy flight upon His banishment, confirm both guilty? Hip. Your pardon, I have done. Iul. Yet (gratious Sir)â Duk. Sister, desist from the renovation of Your vain petition, formerly deny'd, For many weighty reasons, still retaining Their necessary virtue; and employ Your urgent prayers for somewhat, that may win Our free consent, yet not detract from justice: And, what our power can give, be confident You may command. But, for Pausanio's doom, It was decreed irrevocable; then Presse not our resolution for remission. But with his punishment, behold his crime, And you will find Justice, when't sentenc'd him, Was more then mercifull, our stricter Lawes Exacting life, whose rigour we appeas'd With gentler banishment. Let it suffice, That your quotidian intercession hath Mov'd us to such a mercy, as the most Will rather censure partiality, (His ill is known so well. And by your fair Perswasions, do not seek in the worlds eye, To make us impious. Our transmarine friends, (The still admirers of our purer Lawes,) Do not more seek for peace, then desire us A precedent for their perverted justice, Whose bright sword w'have so continued from Th'infectious rust of innovation; and must do so. Therefore (vertuous sister) Presse it no further. Fate, in its decree, Is not more fix'd, more resolute than we. Iul. I have taught my busie tongue an obedient silence; Yet, were your eyes spectatours of those tears, Those tear-begetting tears, my sad-sweet friend Hourly paies her fathers memory; 'Twould mollifie your heart, (thought on't doth mine) [weeps Were your kind ears th'attentive auditors Of her faint sighes, and you not eccho them, Your heart were heartlesse rock. Oh Sir, vouchsafe Her greife but hearing, and her sweet-tongu'd sorrow, Will charm your restrained pitty. Duk. What, statuiz'd Hippolyto? Hip. No, royall Sir, a little womaniz'd, I suck'd it from my mother, and 'twill out. We are not made of marble, but are men. And, but I know your zeal to sacred Justice, I should (with hope t'obtain) presume to beg Compassion, with her Highnesse, from your Majestie, For the late exil'd father, of that yet sorrowing Lady.â Butâ Duk. But what, Hippolito? Recollect thy self; Pausanio was thine enemy. Hip. But how deserv'd, omniscient heaven can witnesse, Best knowing the religious sympathy I have with his sad sufferings. Duk. Spend not the least of thy too pretious thoughts On such a worthlesse subject. Let him suffer, And unpittyed. His meer ingratitude to thee, Setting aside his great offence, Is offence great enough to pull down an affliction Beyond infliction: he suffers worthily. No more of him.âYet, sisterâ Hip. Ha! surely his resolution cannot so soon stagger: [aside. Pray heaven it prove so, or all my plots miscarry, And I am miserable. Iul. I use my possibility; but alasse, To one, whose griefs distract her, comfort is, As Physick to the dead, effectlesse: Who by sage counsell, would suppresse her sorrow, Are heard, but not regarded. Fruitlesse are The hours spent in perswasion. But who sooths Her melancholy with fair hopes, that time May repossesse her Father, with his yet lost honours, Not, alone, attracts her eye and ear, But gaines her heart. Hipol. Oh blest intelligence! [aside Duk. Trust me, I pitty the poor Lady, and wish, Her lavish fathers prodigality, T'enrich her brother, and her fair self with vertue, Had not forc'd him turne bankrupt. Her then needlesse sighs, Had not rais'd up such floods of cruell tears, To drown her joyes. We wore him in our breast, Whilst loyall; but, when he left his vertue, We cast him off, dreading a further danger. But for those pair of spotlesse innocents, His children, they still survive, receiving Warmth from the sun-shine of our favour, Which they enjoy deservedly: Martiano Hath a spirit, as bold, As temperately resolute, which we must cherish; And his sisters; souls, (Like a huge Diamond in a mount of Ore) As rich in vertue, as her exteriour parts in pulchritudes perfection. Hip. Though't be pure truth, from him I like it not. [aside. Duk. Pray let her have all due respect from you, As she shall have from us. Jul. Her merits challenge more, then my performance Can pay her vertue, though my endeavour's aim Be wholly for her griev'd hearts tranquillity. Duk. When next you see this sorrow-clouded Beauty, Let her sweet sadnesse know, our selfe in person, Before expected, will perswasions bring, To alienate her griefs. Iul. Gratious Sir, I shall. Duk. Come my Hippolito. Exeunt Enter Fumante dressing, and Carlo. Fum. Laugh'd at 'm? Car. Oh sir, extreamlyâshe laugh'd untill she leak'd, she wept with laughing. Fum. It could not be, at them; they were too serious; upon mine honour, I ne're compos'd a copy of more pure poetry, and drest in such rich language; in my opinion, they were exquisite Car. No doubt, Sir, and yet she might laugh at 'em. Our women of this age are growne so wise, that what we think meritorious, they believe ridiculous; and sometimes it falls out so, they erre not ever. Fum. Pugh! the style was too lofty, and the conceit tickelith and profound; her weak capacity could not reach the meaning. Car. It may be so: What was the subject? Fum. Her selfe the generall, and every part particulariz'd. Car. Why there's it; will you tickle a womans profundity with a lofty style, and she not laugh at the conceit? it is impossible. Fum. Well, I do hope to nose Vatimius yet, and marry fair Rosania my self. Car. And leave the Lady Dianetta to wear the willow? Fum. No, I'le court her for a Mistresse, the other for a Wife: 'tis providently usuallâ Who's that knocks? [knocks. Some needy Tailor in his Exit Carlo. Apprentises thread-bare cloak; or Seamster, in pittifull foul linnen, is come (with lamentation) to woo for mony. Enter Carlo. Car. Signior, your Shoo-maker, very importunate, desires some short conference with you. Fum. Say l'me abroad. Car. Sir, it boots not, he knowes your constant hour too well; saies, you are ne'r caparrison'd till twelve. Fum. Tell him, he's a rogue, and he lies. Car. Not I, Sir, 'twill bear an action; call a man a rogue for telling truth! If you have not what he comes for, money, at least give him good words. Fum. I never shall endure his importunity. Car. I have a present means to give him suddain motion.â cuts one of his boots cross the toe. Fum. What do'st mean? Car. So now, be angry, that the straitnesse of your boot, forced you to cut it, or you could not have worn 'em: and seem impatient. Exit Carlo, and re-enters with the Shoomaker. Fum. Let me alone. Shoo. Good-morrow to your Worship. Fum. In good time, Sir. What? you come for money, but are like to go without. Pox on your neat work; I must cut new boots, or cannot wear 'em; besides, incur my Lord's displeasure; who verry now in great haste sent for me. Another would return 'em on your hands, but I am mercifull, and you know it well enough, therefore presume: but have a care, for if this trade hold, you'l quickly break. Car. I am afraid so. [aside. Shoo. Sir, I desire your pardon for these, your next shall make amends. Fum. They shall? and when? Shoo. By to morrow this time. Fum. Go to, fail not, if you fail me, I'le fail you. [Exit Shoom. Car. Nay, that's sure enough. [aside. Fum. Thou necessary villain, let me hug thee. Car. Peugh, this is nothing, I have seen a hundred of these tricks in Town. Now must you make a vertue of necessity, and neatly tie it up with this new fashion'd Ribband; and, ere to morrow at night, 'twill prove a fashion. Ties it up, and puts on his Boot. Fum. Excellent Carlo! Again? who's there now? But 'tis no matter, now Carlo goes out, and re-enters. I know the trick on't, I shall be even with some more of ye. Car. The Lord Hipolito hath sent for you. Fum. I attend. Exeunt. Enter Martiano and Ausonius. Mar. Tax not my courage (dearest friend) I dare As much, as man; when warranted by vertue. The day's not more antipatheticall To night, then my bold Soul to coward Fear. But oft we see temerity o'rethrow, What wise delay might have prevented. Protraction is not ever dangerous, But sometimes advantageous; nor is My sure revenge remitted, 'cause deferr'd: No, no, it vegetates, and when mature, With ease, I'l shake the vengefull fruit, that bears A certain ruine with it, upon the heads Of the conspirators, and all at once Crush them to dust. But my designe, as yet, is green. Aus. I not suspect your courage, Martiano, But tardity, for, though our Proverb saith, He that goes slow goes sure; yet, he that hastes, Hath first his ends. I can but counsell you; And proffer my assistance. Mart. Both which, Ausonius, I accept with gratitude: I may have just occasion to put Your noble friendship to a tryall: Till when, I ever shall acknowledge The great engagement my demerit hath Unto your goodnesse. Aus. Do, put me to the proof; Then shall my actions speak my reall heart Better, then my harsh tongue, unpractique in The ceremonious falsities of France, (So much in fashion with our antick age.) My All is thine, and when I prove perfidious, Kill me; till then, trust me. Mar. Thou art all constant goodnesse, and my Friend. In that poor Monosyllable, th'inestimable riches Of our love, lies thesauriz'd Aus. Importunate affaires which envy me The pleasure of thy company, exact Me, for some few houres. Be circumspect, and underneath your thoughts, Your secretest thoughts, let our discourse ly couch'd; There's danger in the appearance. Passion Too often drives man beyond his reason; And a rash tongue betraies a resolv'd heart. Good counsell's ever seasonable. Be wise. And diffident. Hippolitus feign'd friendship Portends no good, his aime's beyond your reach. Be confident, your fathers enemy Can never be your reall friend, his tongue And heart must needs be dissonant. Credit not his soft language; for most sweet The Syrens sing, when they intend to slay. Be firm in your revenge, th'injurious wrongs Of good Pausanio cry loud for't; let him have't. Mart. Could I conceive his injuries grew from that root of Malice, I wouldâ Aus. You are not ignorant, 'tis more then whisper'd Mart. Were he the man, though skulk'd in some obscure And unknown cavern, i'th remotest part Of the wide Universe, my impetuous rage, More swift and terrible than lightning, Soon would finde him out; And soon as found, dissect him into Atoms, Which my just hand should dissipate about His silent Mansion, that the guiltlesse earth (Abhorring such commixture) might intreat The furious justice of some stormy gust, To snatch his ashes from her purer dust. And hurry them to hell. Auso. Passion transports him.âReassume your reason, And once again be vigilant. Exit Ausonius. Mart. My thoughts afflict me, sure it cannot be, Hippolito should wear so smooth a brow, And have a craggy heart; experience Yet often proves the contrary: The Sea, But now calm as a standing Lake, flattering The secure Mariner, in few minutes space, Furrowes his front, and threatens him with wrack. And 'mong a thousand seeming friends, 'tis rare To finde one pair, whose meaning's their expression, 'Mong formall friends; then what can I expect From a known enemy? Ha!â'tis doubtfullâ But my revenge must not be idly grounded, Upon sleight thought, but fundamentall truth. I would not for the world, blur my pure soul With any black mistake;âyet I'le suspect what may be, And 'tis wisdome; hastie fooles Build on the sottile-sand of self-opinion, Whilst th'patient prudent laugh at their sad ruine. I must make farther tryall, then if I find Him guilty, I'l soon ease my troubled mind. Exit Martiano. Enter Hippolito, solus. Hip. I'm now securely fix'd in the Duke's bosome, My power equalls his; his greater title Onely distinguisheth. So politick Syres, T'advance their sons low fortunes, by a Match Deserving better, let them bear the name And glorious sound of Land lord, when th'entrado Runs th'old course into their Coffers. 'Tis my command that executes, the Duke But countenanceth the act. Petitions flock to me, And, as my pleasure shall decree, are granted or oppos'd. I've drest my selfe in such humility, That all mens hearts are mine. Our neighbour Cardinall, (That favour'd Prelate) from th'opressed people, Hath not more hourly imprecations, Than I prayers, smiles, and obsequious cringes What content, to perfect my beatitude, affords The world that's yet deficient, But beauteous Lucibella? the rich crown Of all my joyes, for whose unvalu'd love My honour lies at stake, nay, my dear life, Were I discover'd: whose willfull Father Despis'd my humble suites, and with denyall (Cold as a Northern congelation) Nip'd my then germinating hopes; besides, When but a Neophyte in our Masters favour, Malitiously he sought t'eclipse my glory With a cloud of ruine; which to retalliate, My timely plots have sent him far enough; Yet knowes he not who hurt him. So wise men Vengeance take, whilst th'inconsiderate fool Threatens, and failes. Pausanio, I am now Above thy malice, and resolv'd to win Thy peerlesse daughter, or grow old in sin. to him, Fumante Fum. Summon'd by your command, (my honour'd Lord) My ever-ready dutie brought me, to wait upon you pleasure. Hipol. Fumante, thus in short. I have perceived, and oft, your jealous eye Hath glanc'd at Dianetta more of late, Than any other Lady of the Court. Fum. My Lord!â Hip. And she deserves respect, she's fair; besides, You have enjoy'd with freedome a vouchsafty, That others dare not hope for, many hours Of sweet discourse with her, a certain symptom Of mutuall affectionâYou are happy, Whilst Iâ Fum. My Lord, I've many Mistresses; But, who's most courteous, she predominates. Hip. No jealously, Fumante, I know the boundlesse love you bear her, and The power you have with her; how that your absence Doth not more torture her afflicted soul, Than presence hilarate her heart. Therefore I sent for thee, on whom my hopes depend: For now's the time wherein thou maist expresse Thy gratitude, for all my liberall favours, Profusely shewr'd on thee: Nay more, endear Me to thy love, and our two soules unite, For perpetuity. Fum. (I scent the project, he would inoculate. [aside. Now must I turn pimp,âhumâwell: Would I were the first had undergone, That now much practised function for a Patron. 'Tis a familiar age For you, (my gratious Lord) to whose great bounty I owe more, than the too-short remnant of my life I wish to live, that my whole care and study, Employ'd for your contentment may effect it. Hip. Gratefull Fumante! Ohâmy troubled breast, Doth nourish flaming sulphure. Fum. Wee'l have it quench'd, and speedily. Her quick rolling eyes are characters of kindnesse. Th'other day, (speaking of my Verses) she said, My words were charmes, and that the Lady must be Insensible,âof stone,âthat could withstand my methodâ I'le put her to the proofâCourage my Lord! The Lady's yours Hip. Mercy pronounced to the Delinquent, bears Nothing so sweet a sound,âI am all joyâ Dearest Fumante!âimagination Of what's to come, transports meâprethee how, How, my Fumante? enform me of the way. Fum. With admiration, often I have heard Her speak your merit, and affirm, the Duke Look'd with her eyes, when his election made Your worthy selfe the object of his favours. Hip. On!âprethee on! Fum. The Court (not without cause) might boast of you; For Florence, nor the world, could e'r produce Your Honour's parallel. Hip. My hopes best comfort! On. Fum. Added t'your gifts of nature, goodly feature, Were those of the minde, sound judgment, temper'd vallour, Relieving bounty, and humility, Attracting hearts: in fine all graces, which Requir'd are, to make a man compleat, Unanimously flock'd into your breast, As to their proper center, and there fixed, dwell. Hip. Oh! I shall surfeit with excesse of joy. Fum. Were't possible, her willing tongue could stretch A praise beyond deserving, you should hav't; Which is a proof sufficient she affects you. Now 'twere a necessary policy, my Lord, To tickle her in th'ear with th'like report, From you, concerning her, it cannot chuse but take: And if that fail her mean condition, Being far beneath your honours; Large promises, (lusts sugred bait) and some performance, (The life of expectation) will forcibly prevail. Despair not, for the stuff we have to work on, is MalleableâMy Lord, she is a woman. Hip. Whom means Fumante? Fum. Fair Dianetta. Hip. Dianetta? Fum. Yes: was't not she your honour spake of? Hip. Erroneous apprehension, dull Fumante, Thy jealousie, and my credulity, Equally fool us. My now present griefs, Exceed my late imaginary joyesâ Why did my rage procure the Generall's banishment? Was't not for beauteous Lucibella's love? Fum. Your Lordships word obliged me to believe so. Hip. 'Tis a pure truth, then turn not an Apostate: For my sublime soul fix'd in the pure heaven Of her transcendent beauty, (where doth shine The glory of perfection) disdaines Inferiour community. Fum. Your naming Dianetta, made me Suppose the contrary. For, we of the Court Are rarely bondslaves into constancy. Hip. 'Tis a confess'd fault, would 'twere amended. But now take my intentionst My vertuous fair, with much impatiency, Brooks her lov'd father's absence, and admits Of no society, but sadnesse, whilst My grief-swoln heart doth languish Now to avoid suspition, (for I doubt Martiano's haughty spirit) and to confirm Me in her good opinion, with haste, Repair to Dianetta, that she, through youâ Fum. Now I conceive: may give intelligence To Lucibella, of the constant faith You have vow'd unto her goodnesseâ Hip. Rightâand withall, (For this point is the soul of my designe) How my assiduous supplication is, To impetrate the Dukes remission for Pausanio. Let her speak comfort plentifully, for Thus assure her, I'le never cease my suit, Till I obtain his gracious grant. Do this, andâ Fum. And more, (my Lord) Be confidently cheerfull, and expect, Ere long, a prosperous issue. Exit Fuman. Hip.

I will nor, as most Gallants do, still spend, Whilst I have wherewithall, but pay, That when I want to spend, then spend I may. Jac. Per-lady, no small pollicy. Exit Jac. Vat. This suites the forward issue of a new fashion; yet, am I almost confident, she'l make it elder by a month, then that I gave my man a year since. Well, I must humour her; but if she continue thus, when we are married, we must wear my woods upon our backs, or (like th-Tortoise) carry our houses about us. 'Tis rue mor'd, I shall have her, which I've confirmed, although she never made me any promise, and I strongly believe 't; for I am tearmed the object of the Ladies, and the exact Courtier: Should it go otherwise, I should be bravely laugh'd at. But I'le to her, and know a certainty, for I can scarcely hold out any longer. [to him, Honorio. Hon. Vatinus, well mett. So early ready? and so quaintly drest?

That such a solid judgment, and sweet beauty, Should rashly throw the treasure of her love On a meer glorious outside, troubles me past wonder. Imperious love! placest thou charmes in clothes?

Perish the whole world with us, rather than One graine of our dear honour! fiery flames Run through my frighted veines, and consume me, Before I shall doe justice; patience But a little; I'le instantly returne, And bring the libidinous heart of this mÅchatour A present for you, poynted on my Steele. Hip. First you must cut your passage through me? This is childish rashnesse; and not the fruit Your vowes to patience, and secresie, So fairely promis'd: had I known your temper To be thus volatile? no torment should Have forc'd perswasion, or the name of friend Have wrought this secret from me: giv't me back? (draws. Or I will ransack all your Intrals for't. Mart. Why I am your friend, and (but for you) had liv'd In ignorance, whilst the lascivious Duke Might have brought black dishonour on our house, And I lost my revenge, but, to your love, I owe more then a thousand lives; for now I know his dark intentions, and can Prevent th'm, by killing them in the bud. Performe then your free proffer, joyne with me! Remember it alike concerns youâyou He would have made his cursed instrument, The damned Bawd to his foul lust (my Lord) Youâoh heavens!âthe good Hipolito. Can you hear this, yet not be mov'd? Hip. I can seem so, and compasse my revenge With greater safety; when you rashly runne Your neck into the nuze; and not alone, Your own; but seek to ruine him, that was And would be, your best friend. It is unsafe To play with th'awfull Lyons curled maine, When waking; but a sleep, your pleasure may Command his very heart. Mart. I am to blame: Forgive me; Sir, the cause Must needs distemper the most able brain: You were about to counsell me, pray on! You said the course was sure, and might be suddaine: I vow all patient observance. Hip. Then thus. Some twelve Moones since, you may remember The solemne vow Sicanio freely made Unto your father, whose supply preserv'd His person, people, gallies, from the yoke Of Turkish bondage; when Regibbassa That proud commander, with his whole Armado Set on his weaker power, which (by multitude) 'Ore Master'd, after a cruell fight, Sicanio and the Sicilian Cavalleirs Ready to yeeld themselves unto their mercy, Pausanio, and his power were discri'd A loofe, making from Malta; when the wind Favouring their course, ere a full watch was out, Brought them inken of th'Turkes; your father by Their flags, knew them for foes, and freshly charges Upon their Admirall (till then victorious) Who (after many) by one dangerous shot.

Not that we wish thee ill; but that we may Express our gratitude, for this deliverance, And your great love: For all our lives, and force of Sicilly, Are ty'd to your disposall: So, parted. Now, Martiano, haste you thither, and make known To him your griefes; and if that he be noble, Now's the time to shew it. Mart. But if in case, alleadging he is friend To Florence, he deny me his assistance! Hipol. 'Twere sin to doubt his Princely wordâhow 'ere, Upon your first advise of ill success, I'le have the duke dispatch'd; and 't will be safe. For, in your absence, what suspition can Move any to thinke you interested therein;âha? Mart. Rare, above thought! my constant letters Shall acquaint you withall passages: I will away to night; the wind sits faire. Hipol. Indeed your business doth require wings. Success waite on you?â Exeunt. Enter Ausonius and Lucebella her Clothes changed. Auso. This better change, will much rejoyce your Brother; who, 'bove his owne, preferrs your wellfare. Luceb.

See Martiano's come to waite upon you thither. Mart. To Court! rather to a BordelloâSister, This bravery becomes you wellâyea and abroadâ But best at home: let not my plainness cause Your amazement! the duke hath undermin'd you, And wants but putting to the burning match, Of blowing up your honour: Anon you shall know more; I must this night For Sicilly; my deare Ausonius Will supply my roome, till my returne, whom I (By letters) will enforme of all proceedingsâaway. Luceb. Is this the joy! will unkind fate for ever Lowr'e! is there no mitigation! Mart. Be wisely patient! or you betray My else-sure revenge. Auso. Now thou speakest like my friend. Mart.

To shame my brace of boasters, whose jactations, Have, with your modesty, abus'd my passion. Rosa. Would 'twere affected! Hono. Oh doubt it not! their policy's not so preventive, But we may easily compass it: Only, thus farre, be pleas'd to be assistant; When that Vatinius courts you, let your praise Be of Fumante, and his Poetry: And when Fumante, Vatinius in your eyes A compleat Courtier, and becomes his clothes Be best in Florence: and for the rest, let me alone: Rosa.

Well, it vexeth me beyond all patience, to be Thus affronted, by such a worthlesse Widgeon; Would I durst fight with him! Hono. 'Twould prove a soule Combat; a woodcock with A widgeon. Carlo. Why sir, what should cause your feare? upon my Knowledge, the sight of a drawn sword wil make him swound. Fum. I will not trust him: nor is it good jesting with Edg'd tooles. Carlo. Yet have I seen you quarrell; and on the Piazza, Draw upon a gentle man, for smiling (as you thought) At your new fashion'd hatt, or spurre leather: and with Vociferous language, threaten inevitable slaughter.

Vatinius, whom fame gives out for truth Shall wed Rosania, conceives that you Have grossely injur'd him; for it appears She now begins, to slight him, of which neglect He judges you the Author; because Flowting him to his face; for the bad wearing Of his good cloaths, she emulates your garbe; Vituperating his dull courtship, applauds Your fluent veine; reputes him worthlesse, and Your self deserving; and upon this ground's Resolv'd to challenge you to single Combat. Now if my friendly counsell (only tending To your dear credit, and future good) may Be prevalent; 'twere not amiss you did prevent His peremptory challenge with another; VVhich greatly must disanimate him; denoting You are truly sensible of the wrong he hath done you, In basely skandalizing your merit to your Mistresse. âOh! oche torto?âwhich he Hath often in my hearing done: so shall You justly chastise vice, and re-obtaine Rosania's favour.
