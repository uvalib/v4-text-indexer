      <field name="fulltext">PILATUS Per vous, sir Cayphas, et vous e vous, syr Annas, et sum disciple Judas ou le treison fuite; et grande luces de lucite a moy perfoyte deliverie, nostre dame fuit judge, per loer roy estreite. You lordes and ladyes so lovely and lere, you kemps, you knowne knightes of kynde, herkens all hitherward my hestes to here, for I am most fayrest and freshest to fynd, and most highest I am of estate; for I am prynce pereles, most royall man of ryches. I may deale and I may dresse. My name ys syr Pilate. For Caesar, lord most of postie, honored my estate and my degree when that he sent Jesus to me to delyver him to the dead. The cryed on mee all with on voyce; the Jewes one me made great noyce. I gave them leave to hange him on crosse. This was through Jewes read. I dread yett lest hee will us greeve, for that I sawe I may well beleeve. I sawe the stones begane to cleave and dead men up can ryse. In this cyttye all aboute was non so stearne ne so stowte that up durst looke, for great doubt; they could so soone agryse. And therfore, syr Cayphas, yett I dread leste there were parrell in that deed. I sawe him hange on roode and bleed tyll all his blood was shedd. And when he should his death take, the wedders waxed wondrous blackeâ layte, thonderâand earth beganne to quake. Therof I am adread. CAYPHAS And this was yesterdaye, about noone? PILATUS Yea, syr byshoppe, this ys one. To speake therfore we have to donne. For I lett burye him full soone in a tombe of stonne. And therfore, syrs, amonge us three lett us ordayne and oversee yf there anye parrell be, or we hence gonne. CAYPHAS Syr Pilate, all this was donne, as we sawe after sone; but betyme at afternoone the wedder begane to cleare. And, syr, yf yt be your will, such wordes you lett be styll and speake of another skyll, least any man us heare. ANNAS Yea, syr Pilate, nought forthy! I sawe him and his companye rayse men with sorcerye that longe before were dead. For, and there be any more such lafte which can of such wytchcrafte, yf that bodye be from us rafte, advyse you well, I redd. CAYPHAS Yea, syr Pilate, I tell you right. Lett us ordayne manye a hard knight, well armed, to stand and feight with power and with force, that noe shame to us befall. Lett us ordayne here amonge us all, and trewe men to us call to keepe well the coarse. PILATUS Nowe by Jesu that dyed on roode, methinke your counsell wondrous good. The best men of kynne and blood anonne I wyll in. Syr Colphram and syr Jeragas Aroysiat and syr Jerophas, we praye you, syrs, here in thys case anonne looke you ne blynne. A, my knightes styffe and stearne of hart, you be bould men and smart. I warne you nowe at wordes short, with you I have to donne. PRIMUS MILES Syr, we be here all and some as bowld men, readye bowne to dryve your enemyes all adowne while that wee may stand. We be your knights everychon. Fayntnes in us there shalbe nonne. We wilbe wroken upon thy fonne wherever he may be foundâ and for no dread that we wyll wend. PILATUS That I am well to understand. You be men doughtie of hand; I love you withowt lacke. But that prophett that was donne and drawes throwe the recountinge of your lawesâ but yett somethinge me standes in awes of wordes that he spake. Forsooth, this I hard him saye: that hee would ryse the thyrd daye. Nowe surely and he so maye, he hath a wonderous tatch. SECUNDUS MILES Yea, lett him ryse yf that him dare; for, and I of him be awarre, hee bode never a worse charre or that hee wend awaye. I helped to slea him yerre while. Weenes he to doe us more guyle? Ney, yt ys no parrayle, my head heare dare I laye. TERTIUS MILES Yea, lett him quicken! Hardlye, whiles my fellowes here and I may awake and stand him by, he scapeth not uncaught. For and he ones heave up his head, but that he be soone dead, shall I never eate more bread ne never more be saught. PRIMUS MILES Have good-day, syr. Wee wyll be gonne. Geeve us our charge everychon. PILATUS Nowe fares-well, the best of blood and bonne, and takes good heede unto my sawe. For as I am a trewe Jewe, yf that you anye treasonn sue, there ys none of you all shall yt eschewe but he shall be to-drawe. SECUNDUS MILES Nowe, fellowes, we be charged hye. Our prynce hath sworne that we shall dye withowt anye prophecye or anye other encharre but yf we donne as the wyse. I read us we right well advise. Though he be bould, hee shall not ryse but one of us be warre. TERTIUS MILES Syr, the most wytt lyeth in thee to ordayne and to oversee. You binne the eldeste of us three, and man of most renowne. The tombe ys here att our hand. Sett us there as we shall stand. Yf that he ryse, we shall found to beate him adowne. PRIMUS MILES And I shall nowe sett us soe, yf that he ryse and would goe, one of us, or elles two, shall see of his upryste. Stand thou there, and thou here, and I myselfe in myddle mere. I trowe our hartes will not feare but yt were stowtly wyste. Tunc cantabunt duo angeli: âChristus resurgens a mortuisâ etc., et Christus tunc resurget; ac postea, cantu finito, dicat ut sequitur. Jesus resurgens et pede eos milites quatiat. [JESUS] Earthlye man that I have wrought, awake out of thy sleepe. Earthly man that I have bought, of me thou take noe keepe. From heaven mans soule I sought into a dungeon deepe; my deare lemmon from thence I brought, for ruth of her I weepe. I am verey prynce of peace and kinge of free mercye. Whoe wyll of synnes have release, one me the call and crye; and yf they will of synnes sease, I grant them peace trulye and therto a full rych messe in bread, my owne bodye. I am verey bread of liffe. From heaven I light and am send. Whoe eateth that bread, man or wiffe, shall lyve with me withowt end. And that bread that I you give, your wicked life to amend, becomes my fleshe through your beleeffe and doth release your synfull band. And whosoever eateth that bread in synne and wicked liffe, he receaveth his owne deathâ I warne both man and wiffe; the which bread shalbe seene instead the joye ys aye full ryffe. When hee ys dead, through fooles read then ys he brought to payne and stryffe. Tunc duo angeli, posteaquam Christus resurrexit, sedebunt in sepulchro, quorum alter ad caput, alter ad pedes, sedeant. PRIMUS MILES Owt, alas! Where am I? So bright abowt ys herebye that my harte wholey owt of slough ys shaken. So fowle feared with fantasye was I never in non anoye, for I wott not, witterlye, whether I be on sleepe or waken. Tunc socium surgere cogit. SECUNDUS MILES Where art thou, syr batchlere? About me ys wonder cleare. Wytt me wantes withowten were, for fearder I never was. To remove farre or neare mee fayles might and power. My hart in my bodye here ys hoven owt of my brest. Tunc tanget socium et de somno surgere coget. PRIMUS MILES Yea, we are shent, syckerlye, for Jesu ys rysen, well wott I, owt of the sepulchre mightelye, and therof I have in mynd. And, as dead here can I lye, speake might I not, ney espye which waye he tooke, truelyeâ my eyes the were so blynde. TERTIUS MILES Alas, what ys thys great light shyninge here in my sight? Marred I am, both mayne and might; to moove have I noe mayne. These two beastes that are so brightâ power I ney have to ryse arightâ mee fayle with them for to fight, would I never so fayne. SECUNDUS MILES Yea, I will creepe forth upon my knee tyll I this parrell passed bee, for my waye I may not see, neyther yearth ney stonne. Yea, in a wicked tyme we nayled him on the roode-tree. For us, he sayd, in dayes three that he would ryse agayne. TERTIUS MILES Hye we fast we were awaye, for this ys Goddes Sonne verey. Stryve with him wee ney maye that mayster ys and more. I will to Cayphas, by my faye, the sooth openlye for to saye. Farewell, syrs, and have good-daye, for I will goe before. PRIMUS MILES We to lenge here ys no boote, for needes to syr Pilate we moote and tell him both croppe and roote so soothly as wee wist. For and they Jewes knewe as well as wee that he were rysen through his postie, then should the last errour bee worse then was the firste. Tunc adeunt Pilatum. SECUNDUS MILES Herkens, syr Pilate, the sooth to sayne, Jesu that was on Frydaye slayne through his might ys rysen agayne. Thys ys the thyrd daye. There came noe power him to fett, but such a sleepe he on us sett that none of us might him lett to ryse and goe his waye. PILATUS Nowe by the othe that I have to syr Caesar sworne, all you dogges sonnes shall dye therfore yf yt be on you longe. If that you have privylie sowld him to his companye, then are you worthye for to dye right in your owne wronge. TERTIUS MILES Nowe by the order that I beare of knight, he rose up in the morninge light by vertue of his owne might. I knowe hit well afyne. Hee rose up, as I saye nowe, and lefte us lyenge, I wott nere howe, all bemased and in a swoone as we had binne stycked swyne. PILATUS Fye, theeffe; fye, traytour; fye on thee, thy truth ys full bare! Fye, feynd; fye, feature; hye hence. Fast I read that thou fare! PRIMUS MILES That tyme that hee his waye tooke durst I neyther speake nor looke, but for feare I laye and quooke, and laye in sownd dreame. He sett his foote upon my backe that everye lythe beganne to cracke. I would not abyde such another shacke for all Jerusalem. PILATUS Fye, harlott; fye, hownde; fye on thee, thou taynted taken dogge! What! Laye thou styll in that stound and lett that losingere goe so on the rogge? Syr Cayphas and syr Annas, what saye you to thys trespas? I praye you, syrs, in this case advyse me of some reede. CAYPHAS Nowe, good syr, I you praye, herkens to mee what I you sayeâ for mych avayle us yt mayeâ and doe after my spell. Praye them nowe, syr, pardye, as the loven well thee, here as they standen all three, to keepe well our counsell. ANNAS Syr byshoppe, I saye to you verament, unto your counsell I fullye assent. This foolishe prophet that we all torent through his witchcrafte ys stollen awaye. Therfore lett us call our counsell together and lett us conclude to the whole matter, or elles our lawes are donne forever. PILATUS Nowe in good fayth, full woe ys mee, and so I trowe bynne all yee, that he ys rysen thus privelye and ys from us escaped. Nowe I praye you, syrs, as yee love mee, keepe this in close and privetye untyll our counsell and tyll wee have hard howe hee is scaped. Tunc trade eis pecuniam, ac discedunt; et venient [mulieres] plorantes ac Jesum querentes. MARIA MAGDALENA Alas, nowe lorne ys my likinge. For woe I wander and handes wringe. My harte in sorrowe and sighinge ys sadlye sett and sore. That I most loved of all thinge, alas, ys nowe full lowe lyenge. Whye am I, lord, so longe livinge to loose thy luxonne lore? MARIA JACOBI Alas, wayle awaye ys went. My helpe, my heale from me ys hent. My Christ, my comfort that me kent, is clongen nowe in claye. Mightie God omnipotent, thou give them hard judgment that my soveraygne hath so shent, for so I maye well saye. MARIA SALOME Alas, nowe marred ys my might. My lord through whom that I was light shamefullye slayne here in my syght! My sorrowe ys aye unsought. Syth I maye have no other ryght of these dyvelles that have my lord so dight, to balme his bodye that ys so bryght boyst here have I brought. MARIA MAGDELENA Suster, which of us everychon shall remove this great stonne that lyeth my sweet lord upon, for moove yt I ne maye? MARIA JACOBI Suster, maystrye ys hit nonne. Hit seemes to mee as he were gonne, for on the sepulcher sytteth one, and the stonne away. MARIA SALOMEE Two children I see ther syttingeâ all of whyte ys there clothingeâ and the stonne besydes lyeinge. Goe we nere and see. Tunc ibunt, et aspiciunt in sepulchrum. ANGELUS PRIMUS What seeke ye women here with weepinge and unlykinge chere? Jesus, that to you was deare, ys rysen, leeve you mee. ANGELUS SECUNDUS Be not afrayde of us in fere, for he ys wente, withowten were, as hee before can you leere, forth into Gallylye. ANGELUS PRIMUS This ys the place, therfore be apayde, that Jesu our lord was in layde; but he ys rysen as he sayde, and heathen went awaye. ANGELUS SECUNDUS Hye you, for ought that may befall, and tell his disciples all; and Peter allso saye you shall there fynde him that you maye. MARIA MAGDALENA Ah, hye wee faste for anye thinge and tell Peter this tydinge. A blessedfull word we may him bringe, sooth yf that hit were. MARIA JACOBI Yea, walke thou, suster, by on waye and we another shall assaye tyll we have mett with him todaye, my dereworth lord so deare. Tunc discedent, et palisper circumambulabunt; et tunc obvient discipulis, Petro et Johanni. MARIA MAGDALENA A, Peter and John, alas, alas! There ys befallne a wondrous case. Some man my lord stollne hase and put him I wott not where. PETRUS What? Ys he removed owt of the place in the which he buryed was? MARIA MAGDALENA Yea, sickerlye, all my solace ys gonne and ys not there. JOHANNES EVANGELIST Peter, goe we thither anon, runninge as faste as we maye gonne, to looke whoe hath removed the stonne and whether hee be awaye. PETRUS Abyde, brother, sweete John, leste wee meete with anye fonne; but nowe I see non other wonne, to runne I will assaye. Tunc ambo simul concurrunt, sed Johannes precurreret citius Petro, et non intrat sepulchrum. JOHANNES A, Peter, brother, in good faye, my lord Jesu is awaye, but his sudarye, sooth to saye, lyenge here I fynd by hitselfe, as thou se maye; farre from all other clothes yt laye. Nowe Maryes wordes are sooth verey, as we may have in mynd. PETRUS Yea, but as God keepe me from woe into the sepulcher I wyll goe to looke whether yt be verey soe as Marye to us can saye. Tunc introibit in sepulchrum. PETRUS A, lord, blessed be thou ever and oo, for as thou towld me and other moo I fynd thou hasse overcome our foo and rysen art in good faye. Tunc Petrus lamentando dicat. PETRUS A, lord, howe shall I doe for shameâ that have deserved so mych blame to forsake thy sweete nameâ to meete with thee by any waye, I that in pennance and great anoye my sweete lord forsooke thrye? Save endlesse hope of his mercye, therto trust I maye. For ne hit were his great grace and sorrowe in hart that in me was, worse I were then was Judas, my lord so to forsake. JOHANNES Peter, comforte thee in this case, for sycker my lord Jesu hase greate repentance for thy tresspasse; my lord in hart will take. Goe we seeke Jesu anon in hye, one waye thow, another way I. PETRUS Yea, well I hope through his might my pennance shall him please. Tunc abeunt, hic per aliam viam ille per alteram. Mulieres venient. MARIA MAGDALENA Heathen will I never, syckerlye, tyll I be comforted of myne anoye and knowe where hee is readelye. Here will I sitt and weepe. ANGELUS PRIMUS Woman, whye weepest thou so aye? MARIA MAGDALENA Sonne, for my lord ys taken awaye and I wott nere, the sooth to saye, whoe hath donne that thinge. Alas, whye were I not dead todaye, clought and clongen under claye to see my lord that here laye once at my likynge? Finis</field>
