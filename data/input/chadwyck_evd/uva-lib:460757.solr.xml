      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Caius Marius. Young Marius, Son to Marius. Valerius, a Youth, a Ward of Marius. Sylla, a Roman Patrician. Tubero, a Senator, Friend of Sylla, a Suitor of Flavia. Saturninus, a Tribune, a Friend of Marius. Sulpicius, a Friend of Marius. Ctesiphon, a Greek Sophist, Tutor of Young Marius. Lygdamis, a gigantic Gaulish Slave. Flavia, Niece to Sylla. Cornelia, a Noble Matron, Mother of Flavia. Barine, an old Female Attendant. Senators, Lictors, Soldiers, Magistrates, Citizens, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene is alternately at Rome, at the Farm of Marius, and at Carthage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA sitting Apartment. Cornelia and Flavia seated, the latter employed in some female occupation. CORNELIA. Flavia!âWhat, still intent? Beshrew me, girl! Thou almost dost belie thy blood! How rest'st thou At such a time as this? FLAVIA. And why not, madam? CORNELIA. Why not!âAnd yet the old Cornelian blood Runs in thy veins! Well may it blush. Why, girl, If thou canst rest at such an hour as this, Thou hardly art my daughter. FLAVIA. Dearest madam, And what of good should come of my unrest? CORNELIA. Good?âFoolish thing! 'Twas sure Barine's step,â No, noâwhat, calm, when all is on the cast And Rome looks hardly Roman! Gods preserve us, Would Sylla were come back! Enter Barine. Barine! now, What news? BARINE. What news? Oh! Madam, every hour Brings in a worse report. They say the Cimber Hath join'd the Ambron; and the desert sand, Stirr'd to fierce action by the whirlwind's breath, Outnumbers not their host. I heard a slave Say that he talk'd with one who, some days back, Pass'd o'er the plain where they had rested them: 'Twas trampled all, as if some mighty powers Had met in battle to enslave the world, And struggled foot to foot. Nor tree, nor bush, Nor turf, nor greenling blade, for league on league, But told their passage, prostrated and torn In one wide devastation,âlocust-like, Where'er they sweep is ruin. Nay, 'tis said, That when they shout, th' o'er winging birds drop down, Stunn'd with that giant clamour. CORNELIA. What of Sylla? Who is made general? BARINE. Nothing heard I, madam, And nothing could I hear. The Senate sits In anxious consultation; whilst the crowds Toss names about, and bandy to and fro Conjectures, hopes, and fears. Some talk of Sylla, Someâ CORNELIA. Peace! he 's here. Flavia, quick! hasten, girlâ Who enters? FLAVIA (returning). It is only Tubero, madam. Perchance he comes to tell of Sylla's coming. BARINE (aside). Oh! âonly Tubero, madam!ââHe 's old and rich, Valerius is poor and handsome, madam; Bah!âthese young fools! CORNELIA. What mutt'rest? BARINE. Nothing, madam. [Exit. Enter Tubero. CORNELIA. Health, Tubero!âWe are anxious, all; what news? Who 's general? TUBERO. The Senate has elected, After long storm and pause, Marius. CORNELIA. What! Marius! He! the Patrician of the Plebes! Marius; That bear with gilded collar! Caius Marius! Could Rome's patricians not afford a leader? Is the wine drawn, or else the vintage spoil'd, That we must strain the dregs? Now, by my life, I'd taken sword and buckler first; ayeâwoman E'en as I amârather than this had been! TUBERO. Be patient, madam, pray you. Here is Sylla, Your noble relative; and he will tell you He gave his voice for Marius. Enter Sylla. SYLLA. Save you, lady. CORNELIA. You are welcome, Sylla. But you had been more so (For I must speak the truth) if that right hand Had grasp'd the general's truncheon. Marius! Sylla! I can't away with 'tâSylla after Marius!â I cannot syllable 't. SYLLA. Take time, good lady; We shall all learn. TUBERO. I fear, Cornelia never! Patience is out of doorsâand Caius dubb'd âA bearâwith gilded collar!â SYLLA (agitated). He 's a soldier, A tried one; that 's enough. Say he be rude And rough of speech; say that his discipline (And that it does I, who have felt it, sayâ) Doth smack of times when Roman hardihood Had felt not Greek refinement; yet, believe me, With all his harshness, he is like that tree Whose leaves embrown i' the sun; but, tho' rust-like, Deep umber'd towards the torrid eye of day, Are ever green beneathâ Nay! no more words. What, know ye not when Scipio erst was ask'd âWhere Rome should find another general?â He answered âHereâin Caius;â and by my soul, She will. âNobility!ââWhen fortune lours, And kingdoms quake to th' centre, he who doth His duty best 's your truest noble! CORNELIA. Sir; You are warm. SYLLA. Noâno. CORNELIA. And do you serve with him? SYLLA. I do. What then? CORNELIA. Only I hope you 'll profit In such a noble school. SYLLA. I shall; no doubt on 't. Madam, too much of this. Who serves his country Cannot but profit. Tubero, time presses; There is no hour to lose. If Marius close not Ere that pale moon be oldâaye, if he spring not Upon the Cimber like the famish'd lion, I know him not. I shall sup here. Meantime, See to our preparation. Thou knowest who And where. Why dost thou pause? TUBERO. Only to say Good even. And to hope that these bright eyes Shall gaze on us the brighter that we come All crown'd with garlands, and victorious home. FLAVIA. What Rome shall smile on ne'er shall make me frown. TUBERO. Fair patriot! I 'll take you at your word. Perchanceâ. SYLLA. Come, Tubero, these soft enigmas Suit not the time. Farewell! [Exit Tubero. Ladies, your hand. Nay, madam, you shall smile. Next time, perchance, I shall be general. Flavia!ânay! no tears! When Rome shall weep, weep then. Come, come; no weakness. [Sylla leads them out. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in the Farm-House of Marius; the Table covered with Wine, Fruits, &amp;c., for a Banquet. Marius, Young Marius, Valerius, and Ctesiphon. MARIUS. Speak, then, an if thou must;âI'll hear't; but only Dress not thy speech in garlands, as thou usest. Let real wreaths content thee; and for once Try not to utter holiday. CTESIPHON. My good lord, You are obeyed. It is my gracious office To offer you this cup; and having drain'd Mine own to your best health, humbly to beg Not only as your servitor, but i' the name Of those more worthy of such fellowship That you will pledge us. This to Marius' health; [Drinks. And may Jove grant him many days like this Vouchsafing ear to Mars. VALERIUS, &amp;c. To Marius' health! [They drink. MARIUS (getting up). Give me the cupânot that befool'd with flowers; I 'll have a plainer gobletâand this once I 'll pledge you such a health; and then no more on 't Henceforth for ever. Health to thee, Valerius; To all (drinks). You pledge me cheerily, young men; Your sun is rising and your shadows fall The onward way to fortuneâmine points backward, And rests but on the grave. Oh! never more Shall day like this be mine: then why commemorate The dead with festal flow'rs, and mock oblivion With garlands like a bride? [Much agitated. Bring me, for once Again, that sword, against which this day's sun Flash'd, till that brightness was bedimm'd and veil'd In blood of Rome's barbarian enemies; Aye; which strook down, in face of either host, That Gaulish sworder who o'er-tower'd them all, Then spared the crippled giant for our triumph;â Bring 't me, Valerius; go thou, boy; thy head Is not bedeck'd with flaunting wreaths, like theirs! [Valerius goes out. Curse on this pageantry. It fits me not. YOUNG MARIUS (aside). What should this mean? Till now I never saw His spirit clouded thus. [Valerius returns with the sword. MARIUS. Right. Give it me. [Takes the sword from Valerius. Come to me; let me clutch thee, for the last time. I will not part from thee as lovers do With sighs; but as a friend parts from a friend, Feeling he is not worthy! Faithful steel! Too trusty for this hand, which needs thee not,â Which can but hang thee up to rust in slothâ I 'll bid thee now adieu! What want I with thee, Unless to shame thee? Hence! I'd not misuse thee, Nor make a baby's toy of thee, whose manhood Shall woo thine aid no more. Yet, ere thou goest, I'll kiss thee lover-like! and thus I sever thee From this dishonour'd hand. If thou be fortunate, Go find some better grasp. If not, go rust In other halls than mine! [He throws down the sword. VALERIUS. My noble patron, This is too much!âyou are much mov'd. MARIUS. No, no! 'Twill pass away anon. Speak to me not. Leave me. [They leave Marius gazing on the sword. Last light of Marius! I do gaze upon thee, Ev'n as the sailor eyes the sinking sun, Or ere night drops on him and on the main! [A trumpet sounds. Ha!âWhat should mean that sound, now so unwonted, At such an hour as this? Thou lookest wonder; Enter Valerius. What is the news? VALERIUS. Great news, great sir! th' Ambrones, 'Tis said, are up in countless arms, and gloom Black, like some dark and pestilential cloud, Upon the northern frontier. Nigh at hand Are missives from the Senate; and your son Goes forth to herald them. MARIUS (musing). Missives from the Senate! To Caius Marius! the plebeian Marius! The people's scorned Consul! all unhonouredâ Save those his hand hath won! (In sudden exultation.) I am not dead; This heart still beats for glorious deeds; great Jove Doth need me yet,âand Fate hath work for me. (Aloud) Where are the messengers? (Musing again.) Ev'n as the mist, That wraps the mountain summits, is dispers'd And leaves their rugged cliffs bright i' the air, Now is a sudden view unveil'd, where hills Rise over hills, some shadow'd and some light, Kissing the dark blue sky! I'll climb, or else Be buried at their feet! (Aloud.) Valerius! (Musing again.) Was it not told me, e'en in early childhood, Seven eaglets dropp'd into my lap, high token Of sevenfold exaltation? Marius, yet Thou shalt be seven times Consul! (To Valerius.) What would'st thou say? VALERIUS. Methought you spoke, great Sir! MARIUS. True, so I did; Forgive me,âsay, where are the messengers? [Flourish of trumpets. VALERIUS. At hand, my lordâ The trumpet speaks as much. Enter Sulpicius and Saturninus, Young Marius, Lictors, and Attendants. MARIUS. Hail! Sirs, your errand? SATURNINUS. Let it not, noble Caius, (For virtue is our true nobility,) Seem strange that thus we break upon your privacy With hasty salutation. What we say We speak i' the Senate's name, who bids us thus, In Rome's behalf, with tongue for the general weal, Accost thee, Marius. MARIUS. From the Senate, say ye? Mistake I not? To Mariusâfrom the Senate? I pray you pardon me, if it seem strange The Senate thinks of Marius, who, in sooth, Had nigh forgot the Senate! SULPICIUS. Mighty sir, 'Tis easy for a great man to forgetâ But not to be forgotten. I do pray Your patience, sir; our errand is the proof Even of our doctrine. Great events, oh! Marius, Are great men's heralds. Is it not so, e'en now? The sacred soil of Rome again is trodden, Torn, and polluted by the countless feet Of rude, unphalanx'd, rash barbarians, Who come to find a grave;âeven as the brand But leaves the cloud to quench it in the dust And vainly die in darkness. 'Tis to thee The Senate looks to front this louring storm; And thus thy staff of office I deliver, And, i' the Senate's name and in the people's, Do hail thee Imperator. [Gives the truncheon. Save thee, general! ALL. Health to thee, Imperator! all hail, general! Marius (much agitated). I pray your patience friends. And comes this, say'st thou, This Roman truncheon, from a Roman Senateâ This staff that never yet did point the way Where Victory fear'd to go;âwhat! came it thence? SULPICIUS. It did, great sir. MARIUS. And to a poor old manâ Whose little fame hath died before his breath, And from whose name the very calendar Feels haply shame to date? What, is there none Of all that tread those lofty porticos, Where kings must wait without; none there to save Such gear as that from such a hand as this? âFie! this is mockery! and grey hairs, tho' bound With wreaths, which, wither'd, still were victory's, Are treated like the rest!â Nay, take it, sir; This jest doth smack o' the serious. SATURNINUS. Noble sir, 'Tis you that turn the serious to a jest, And none e'er more mistim'd. Now hear me, sir. Hear that shall thrill through the whole heart of Marius. Your country is in danger, and to you She looks for help, for rescue. MARIUS. Speak 't again, That I may hear aright. Give me thy hand. Say'st thou, with honest and unvarnish'd brow, That Rome doth sue to Marius? SATURNINUS. Even so. MARIUS. Her fiat is obey'd. Rome must command; Obedience is for Marius. Give me yond blade, Valerius. [He takes the sword. Welcome! aye; now let me clutch thee, Thou trusty steel! and oh! hear Marius swear Thou shalt not leave his hand till Rome is safe, Or we lie buried in one grave together, And know not of our fortune. Sir, I do Obey the Senate's mandate; but I pray you Tell me, if so much be within your knowledge, Who doth command in second? SATURNINUS. Lucius Sylla, Most noble Marius. MARIUS. Good; the noble Sylla. I know him well, and know him for a soldier, A tried and brave one. Pardon me, gentlemen; It is an anxious hour; I had forgotten That travel-toil'd and weary, you do need Nature's refreshment, if the fare of Marius Balks not patrician stomachs. This way, gentlemen, I pray you. Nay! no ceremony, friends: Plain fare is best grac'd plainly. [Marius and Embassadors go out. Valerius, Young Marius, and Ctesiphon remain. CTESIPHON. Valerius?âWhy, see, if this news from Rome have not struck him dumb. Why, man, dost thou set out thy battle already?â YOUNG MARIUS. He's general already in imagination methinks! Come, Valerius, let us hear thee speak. We can see thee fight afterwards! VALERIUS. Thou wilt prate Before thou fightest; I'll say that for theeâ I cry you mercy, sir, for I believ'd 'Twas Ctesiphon I spoke to. YOUNG MARIUS. Take me for aught but a barbarian whilst thou carriest this humour about with thee! Come, Ctesiphon; 'tis plain he's possessed with something, and whether it be love or war, neither is a business for us to meddle in. MARIUS (entering). Valeriusâget thee forth in readiness; Thou shalt from me to Sylla; for methinks I have heard thee say thou knewest him. YOUNG MARIUS. Aye; his niece too! They say she's wond'rous fair. A very star! Nay some philosophers hold, that the lost Pleiad Is found again in her! Don't they Valerius? MARIUS. Peace, reckless prater. What! is this a time For fooleries such as these are? Son, do you Attend upon the embassadors from Rome. Do you assist him, sir. Your fine-spun sophisms Will now get holiday;âthe wars abide not These cobwebs of the brain! [Exeunt Ctesiphon and Young Marius. Valerius, Go thou with me. I have business for thine ear And time is precious. Come. VALERIUS. I follow, sir. [They go out. END OF FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Chamber. Enter Tubero and Barine. BARINE. Now Jupiter be prais'd! Is 't surely true? TUBERO. I tell thee 'tis most certain. Where's Cornelia? I would fain tell her this good news. BARINE. Anon. But say that Sylla's safe. TUBERO. Plague on thy twaddle; Tedious old catechist! He's safe, though hurtâ Praise heaven! here comes Cornelia. Enter Cornelia and Flavia. Save you, ladies; And may the gods vouchsafe you health and gladness To welcome this great news. CORNELIA. What is 't, good Tubero? Howe'er it touches me, for Rome I hope Most salutary. How now, Flavia!âGirl! Shame on thy coward cheeks! I trust our garlands Shall shew a brighter colour. Nay, speak, Tubero. TUBERO. The Ambrones are destroyed. E'en now great Marius Seems bent to fertilize the very soil Of Rome with blood of her fierce enemies. Mars never saw such slaughter. Women rush Upon their husband's falchions; father's kill Their children and then die; despair laughs loud, As she had chang'd her nature at the sight; And pity, as too weary to plead more, Seems tired thro' very ruthâ CORNELIA. And Syllaâ TUBERO. He, Thank Jove, is safe, tho' hurt;âbut that's not much. CORNELIA. Great Jove be prais'd!âHow was 't? Now tell us, Tubero. Beshrew me, but she'll faint. Why, foolish girl! Here, lean upon this shoulder. FLAVIA. Pardon meâMadam. CORNELIA. How was 't, good Tubero? Nay, speak. TUBERO. Good madam, His wound is nothing; but 'tis said the youth Who brings this newsâplague on 't! his name?âValerius, Did venture far for Sylla, or there might Have been sad eyes to-day. CORNELIA. Flavia!âthis girl, Methinks, would mar a triumph. Sylla's safe. And if Valerius, whom we have well noted As a well-govern'd youth, hath been the cause, The greater cause for gladness. FLAVIA. 'Tis so, madam. But pray, you pardon me. A sudden joy Doth sometimes shew like sadness. CORNELIA. Heed her not, Tubero, She will be calm anon. Is there aught more? TUBERO. Not, that I know, good Madam. Young Valerius, E'en now, doth pass with letters to the Senate, Which haste and curiosity, ere this, Have well assembled. Marius is to triumph; That's certain. Hark! [Distant shout. The people throng the streets To see Valerius pass, who scarce can pass Mid the tumultuous joy. [Louder shouts. Hear you not, Flavia? The rogues will deafen Jove! Will 't please you, madam, To walk abroad and see the public joy? CORNELIA. We'll walk with you, good Tubero. Come, Flavia; Sure now you're strong enough. [Great shouting. Hark how the plebs, For ever in extremes, the very concave Rend in hoarse acclamation. Well, well, Tubero, The rogues have cause! Come, Flavia. Nay, good Tubero, No ceremony pray you. [They go out. SCENE II. âA Street in Rome. Enter a crowd of Citizens, and then Tubero and Lictors. FIRST CITIZEN. Come, my masters, range yourselvesâtake orderâ and let every man's cap and voice be ready to greet our general. SECOND CITIZEN. Right: order, comrades! order! But first, by way of practice, one cheer for the general, and then rank and file. (They shout.) Marius for ever! Now, take order! Fall in, my masters; fall in, I tell you: this is our ovation, as well as our general's triumph! Therefore âVox Populiâ again! another cheer; and then order! [Shout. TUBERO. Make way here. Clear the streets. Why, gentlemen! (Aside). For all are gentlemen to-day. More 's pity! (Aloud). Why, gentlemen! will ye clog up the triumph Your numbers come to grace! Nay, nay; stand back. Marius is coming, and he will have way Despite whoe'er could bar him. [Distant shout. Hear ye not? Lictors make room for Marius. (Aside.) Oh! that Rome Should have been made for Marius!â(Aloud). Why, how now? Lictors, I say, move on; and let the plebs Make way for their own general. FIRST CITIZEN. What swaggerer is this? An if the underlings Do fume and vapour thus, this Marius, Cacus-like, Must carry fire in 's mouth, and will make Rome Ere long too hot to hold him. SECOND CITIZEN. Hush! I tell you: 'Tis Tuberoâa noble Roman; and My patron. Hark you now. Pray you, my lord, Is Marius near at hand? TUBERO. Nigh? God's-my-life! He pass'd the mural breach, by th' Esquiline, An hour ago. [Trumpets, and distant shouts. At hand? I think good friends, You have your answer. Room, there; room for Marius! Enter Marius, in triumphal proccession; Sylla, Valerius, Young Marius, Ctesiphon, Sulpicius, Saturninus, Lictors, Captives, &amp;c. Cornelia and Flavia appear at a window. The People cry âMarius! Marius!â MARIUS. Thank you, my friends. This heart-felt salutation O'erpays and leaves me debtor. I do pray you To keep some kindness in reserve, and let me Have hope to merit more. Lictors, move on; And look that, as ye clear the way, no Roman Do meet or harm or rudenessâthank you, friends. [Shouts. Marius and Valerius passing over the stage. YOUNG MARIUS (aside to CTESIPHON.) Quick! hither, Greek, and let thine idle eye Fix on yond casement. Gods! did'st ever see A charm like that to put out glory's blaze And make a triumph poor? CTESIPHON. By heavens a pearl! An unspeck'd diamond! YOUNG MARIUS. By heav'ns, a sunbeam, Made to lend light to diamonds! if aught Could ere reflect such beauty. Greek, I charge thee, Thou eye her well.âYet why? for Rome itself Can only have one suchâev'n as the heav'ns Have but one moon!âOh! that my tongue had pow'r To charm her from her sphere! Lo! she hath noted us, And even now retiresâOh! such a light Should never setâ CTESIPHON. My lord!âwe must on; already Eyes are upon us. Hark! (music) the quire!â YOUNG MARIUS. Away!â The frame may go, but here the soul must stay! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Senate House. The Senate in their robes, with ivory wands. CHORUS. In vain the mountain's haughty head Is lifted to the upward sky; For lo! the vengeful bolt is sped, And low the scatter'd fragments lie: Be such the fate, be such the doom, Of all who hate or envy Rome. In vain the shaggy pard may seek A shelter for her brindl'd brood; The eagle stoops, with horny beak, And feasts and revels in their blood: Be such the fate, be such the doom, Of all who hate or envy Rome. Enter Marius, Sylla, Tubero, Valerius, Young Marius, &amp;c. FIRST SENATOR. Marius, all hail! I welcome thee, great Caius, I' the Senate's name: and if 't were possible That pain should be on such a day as this In any Roman breast, it were in mine, For that my tongue doth lack of resonance To render e'en faint echo of the praise And thanks that should reguerdon thee. The Senate, Not in their sole behoof, but as the voice Of the whole public wealâof which they form A fragment onlyâthank thee, Caius Marius! Do thou wrap up in that one word what I Would fain express, but cannot. More. In token Of that, which is unsaid because unspeakable, They crown thee here with that which never press'd Brow, save such brow as thine,âthe wreath of victory, Giv'n by a grateful country. Thou hast won it; And worthily. So wear it, Marius. 'Tis The laurel; type of glory and of fame, For both are bright and fadeless. [Crowns Marius. MARIUS. Conscript fathers, Elect and chosen of your country, Rome, 'Tis not for meâ'tis not for any man, To bandy phrases here, or plead unworthiness In that which you deem worthy. I do thank ye, That ye have honour'd me so far; not daring To think I am o'er-honour'd, or that Rome, Who warreth with the proud, could flatter Marius. No more of this. Because no more becomes Or me or you, the giver or receiver. Short phrase the best becomes the rude of speech. This then but let me say. If there be aught Further that Rome commands of Caius Marius, He is his country's servant. Sylla (aside to Tubero.) Mark'd ye, Tubero? Mark'd you the high Patrician o' the Plebs, Th' aristocrat of the democracy? His pride has grown a stadium! Oh, he's worthy: The Senate's right enough! FIRST SENATOR. Next, noble Sylla, The Senate turns to you. In praising Marius Sylla is grac'd; for Sylla is but second That Marius is the first; above compare With aught that's less than Marius; yea and crown'd With the same wreath undying. But there's more. Another wreath to show how Rome loves Sylla. Stand forth, from 'midst the crowd, Publius Valerius. (Valerius stands forward.) For that thou shed'st thy blood to rescue this For Rome, Rome's Senate hath, in gratitude, Voted the oaken garland to Valerius. Take it. 'Tis thine, young man. VALERIUS. Oh! had it hung Above my urn, so Sylla were but safe, It were too much of happiness and fame. YOUNG MARIUS (aside). Ah! say'st thou so?âmark'd ye that, Ctesiphon? By Jove, so say not I! We could have spar'd him! Aye; marry!âand have deem'd the blood of Marius Too good for such a ransomâ FIRST SENATOR. Now, great Marius, My last most pleasant task is but to say, The Senate are your guests i' the Capitol; And ere this day's auspicious sun hath set, Will pour a rich libation to the Gods For health to Marius: that he may once more Be one of Rome's most Roman Consuls. (Turning to the Senators.) Rise, Oh! Conscript Fathers. Welcome Caius Marius; And joy attend his banquet! [The Senators rise, and Marius and the rest pass over the stage, saluting them, and retire. CHORUS. The hour is past; the deed is done; Their mighty thread the fates have wove; No foeman sees to-morrow's sun, Or 'tempts again Feretrian Jove: Then welcome, Marius, welcome home! Welcome to honour and to Rome! [Scene closes. SCENE IV. âA Street in Rome. Enter Young Marius and Ctesiphon, meeting. YOUNG MARIUS. Welcome! my learned scout. Thou lookest brightly, Say, hast thou sped aright? Tell me but that,â Then say what guerdon Rome can offer thee, And thou shalt have 't. Nay, ne'er look doubtfully. Shew me the neat, snug farm, by Tiber's side; The fruitful vineyard; or the villa's shade That takes thy fancyâand succeed in this,â And (mark me)âit is thine! We are something now, And Marius can do somewhatâ CTESIPHON. Noble sir; I have track'd her to her covert. YOUNG MARIUS. What, a word!â Such gem should have a casketâaye, and of The richestâfor what veil were rich enough To shroud such beauty? CTESIPHON. Call it what you will; I know her Home. Comes that not home enough, Howe'er it be entitled? Who, or what The exquisite inmate is, as yet I have not Obtain'd safe means of knowledge: for I would not Risk overbold enquiry. YOUNG MARIUS. Thou didst right. But art thou sure of this? CTESIPHON. As sure, my lord, As ever Greek was sure of any thing That cunning might unravel. YOUNG MARIUS. It is well. For this good service thou art twice my friend, And so shalt still be held. (Aside) I 'll pay him doubleâ (Aloud) Away, and learn the rest, for I 'm on fire. Corrupt some slave. Use all thy languages, For thou hast manyâput forth all thine art; And only compass this, and I shall call theeâ CTESIPHON. What, my good lord? YOUNG MARIUS (aside). The Polyglott of Pandars! (Aloud) âWhatâ didst thou say? Why, thrice my friend; that 's all. What else could I entitle thee? We are cut shortâ Enter Valerius. Away, and speedâbe sure on 't! [Exit Ctesiphon. Save you, comrade; Why, thou look'st grave, methinks! VALERIUS. So do'st not thou. Triumph, methinks, is written in that eye, (Aside) And pride upon that brow. (Aloud) Come, we should bear Success more gently. YOUNG MARIUS. Poh! what mean ye, sir? I got no oaken garlandâ VALERIUS. Say thou did'st not; Thou hast got something that can please as much, Or else thy looks are liars. YOUNG MARIUS. So I have. A prize the which to clutch methinks were worth Another Marian triumph. Oh! 'tis not The end of war that is the end indeed; The end is that of which the trumpet speaks not; The end is that of which your annals tell not; The end is that which glory never names; The end is that which even rapine recks not; Below the famous, and above the baseâ The choicest spoil of beauty. By the gods! I had ne'er known that Marius quell'd the Cimber Had I not known this hour! VALERIUS (aside). What passion 's this That stirs his nature thus; that nature never Framed for such domination? (Aloud) Sir, you speak Not like a man who humbly thanks the gods, That he was born foredoom'd to serve his country; But, like some robber, whom unlook'd-for fortune Hath loosed to prey at largeâunawed, untouch'd By gratefulness or honour. YOUNG MARIUS. Hast turn'd Stoic, In downright earnest, sweet Valerius? Ha! ha! methinks I cannot chuse but laughâ! Thou 'rt twenty years too young yet for the porch! Hang up philosophy! VALERIUS. No man, I hope, Can be too young for virtue. YOUNG MARUIS. Hang philosophyâ I tell thee! or, if needs't must be a Soph, Take Epicurus! Psha!âCome! come with me, I 'll shew thee that shall make thee convertite; Or, if it fail, thy blood hath yet to learn The wherefore it was risk'd! Come! Thou knows't Plato Doth say 'tis good to contemplate on beauty. VALERIUS. What dos't thou mean? YOUNG MARIUS. Come with me and thou 'lt know. I 'll shew thee, peradventure, a sweet bird, Form'd to make Venus scorn her favourite dove. Oh! if the song be equal to the hueâ And who can doubt it that hath eyes? I 'd not Lose 't from my bosom for the Consulship And all that Rome affords. VALERIUS (aside). What can this mean? Ev'n at his words I feel a chilly fireâ I know not what of shudd'ring feelingâcreep Thro' my whole frame.âI tremble with a fear That knows not what it fears! Methought that Greek, Who glided hence e'en now, snake-like, bore villany Couch'd in his eye. YOUNG MARIUS. What 's all this reverie? Art seeking Plato's precedent? I tell thee, He says, 'tis wise e'en for philosophers To know a handsome wench, if chance they see one! Come; wilt thou go? VALERIUS (aside). I feel a wild misgivingâ And yet it cannot beâthis loose and libertine Discourse alone would strike a kind of fear In all who can love virtue;âand her beauty Would awe such thoughts as these. It cannot beâ It is a baseless terror. YOUNG MARIUS. Come, philosopher! I cannot wait for thy deep contemplations. Wilt stayâor go? VALERIUS. No. YOUNG MARIUS. Why, farewell then! VALERIUS. Stop.â (Aside) Methought a voice did whisper meââStay not And innocence in dangerâwheresoe'er That innocence may dwell.â (Aloud) I will go with thee. [Exeunt. END OF SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Street in Rome, somewhat dark. Enter Ctesiphon, disguised, and Barine. CTESIPHON. Hear this, before thou goest. If thou art false, And play'st the traitress with us, that dark dungeon, In which Jugurtha famish'd, is thy lot, As sure as Jove can thunder. Serve Young Marius, And this is but an earnest of the bounty (gives money) His gratitude shall heap on thee. Beware, then; Thou 'rt counsell'd on both sides BARINE. Sir,âMy Lord, Young Marius, and yourself may rely on me. What I now have told you is soothâhe shall find it to-night if he adventure. Only beware of Syllaâyou now know the kindred! CTESIPHON. We fear not Sylla. The time 's past for that, I doubt thee not; but it is fit thou knowest The penalty of doubtâso shalt thou be The warier to ensure success. Now go, Lest we should be observed; and be thou sure To time the hour to a minute. BARINE. I am school'd; The sun shall not be more exact than I. CTESIPHON. Then, fare thee well! and prosper, for thine own sake. [Exit Barine. These are the magnanimous Romans! these the Gods Of the nether world!âBy heaven! the very wolf, Whose life is rapine, is not like to these.â He teareth not his fellow, and will starve E'er he lap kindred gore. While this fell libertine, Whom fate doth seem to have set astride on fortune, Must tear the heart of innocence, tho' that deed Shall stab his very friend. What's that to thee Oh! Ctesiphon? Thou art no son of Rome. Thy country hath been crush'd beneath the hoofs Of these her ruthless brood; be it thy pastime, Having made thee a slave, to see them slaves To their own curbless passions; having torn Thy heart, do thou help them to tear their own; And laugh when they reward thee for such service, Whom they have made unfit for any other. Let no weak, womanish pity mar thy purpose. This Marius doth revenge thy country, Greek; Then be thou grateful; think thee of thy home; He strikes for thee each blow he deals to Rome. [Exit. SCENE II. âA Chamber in Cornelia's House. Flavia aloneâshe walks to the window. This is the Roman holiday. The sky Glares with the festal fires; unnumber'd feet Throng to the lighted temples; and the crowds With shows and shoutings, and the violent gusts Of popular breath, do magnify their Consul; While they of higher strain bless the great Fates For our Rome's safety, and pour fresh libations Of joy to the immortal Gods. Amid this tumult Silence is mine. Methinks there hangs i' th' air Some troubles yet which augurs tell not of, Nor will the skies reveal. Sylla I've noted With lip compress'd by inward struggling thoughts; And on Valerius' browâoh! guest too early For such a mansionâcare, methought, did sit In spite of smiles. [She pauses. Hear me, O! purest Dian, Who with unsandall'd foot dost print the snows, But sulliest not their whiteness; at whose breath Even the virgin rose shews transient blush Throughout her unsunn'd leaves, woke by a sigh Less warm than Zephyr's! Spread thy milk-white veil Over thy votress; and still rampart her Who is but strong in thee. Enter Young Marius, guided by Barine. BARINE. Be not too suddenâ YOUNG MARIUS. Goâand prate not, hag. I am resolv'd;âand now, oh! AphroditÃ¨,â Now, Venus, CythereÃ ,âzoned queen,â Lend music to my tongue, such as thou gav'st The Syrens,âor did'st teach Endymion To woo the ice-cold Moon! Is she not like thee In all beside? Then, Venus, let that bosom Beat in soft tune with thine. Now, Cupid, help me. (Aloud.) Such greeting as the tongue of love would give To beauty such as thine, I give thee, lady, In heart if not in breath. FLAVIA. Protect me, powers! What man art thou? What means this dark intrusion? Know'st thou that this is Rome? and know'st thou, sir, These are a Roman matron's floors, whose threshold Crime never pass'd,âsince virtue ever guards it? Unheralded thou com'st, a rude embassador, Whatever be thine errand; so I treat thee. I'll hear thee not;âbegone! YOUNG MARIUS. That this is Rome, Lady, methinks, I never learn'd till now. Rome is the queen of cities. So she is, Containing thee; which did she not, I wot That boast might go elsewhere. Nay, shun me not; If 'tis a crime to kneel, where adoration Is child of sweet necessityâif to love, Where coldness were miraculous, be sin,â Then must I suffer. FLAVIA. Insolent! Say, who art thou? YOUNG MARIUS. One can love beauty as it should be lov'd; One can guard beauty as it should be guarded; One who can seek it as it should be sought; One can deserve itâwhen that it is won! Oh! I have known ere now what passion is, But not like this. E'en as the bridegroom rushes To his bride's arms, so have I yearn'd to rush, And, if need were, bid breath and blood go forth Amid Rome's fiercest foes; yet, in that flame, With hate and glory burning in my veins, Ne'er did I feel such ardour as when now I gaze upon those charms, and every glance Seems call upon my manhood to be sure The conquest shall be mine. Nay, tremble not. I that seem terrible, am but thy slave, Whose life doth hang upon thee; and whose lip Shall echo thy commandsâwhose love alone Brooks not to be commanded; and thus claims thee With a most gentle violence. FLAVIA. Unhand me, Rash and unmanly ruffian. Thou a Roman! Rome sure is sack'd, and the barbarian here, Despite plebeian Marius! YOUNG MARIUS. (Aside.) Hah!âso lofty? By heavens I love her better for 't; and triumph Is doubly sweet, dash'd with a smack of scorn. (Aloud.) Lady, I love thee, and in such a wise As reason reaches not, and, therefore, seeming Is not that which it seems. I venture all, And I must have all, or I 've nothing won. Now, help me, God of Love (struggles with her). Enter Sylla. SYLLA. Whoe'er thou art, That thus dar'st outrage aught pertains to Sylla, Of name or namelessâruffian violator;â Slaveânot of beauty, but thine own foul heart, Thust do'st thou pay the forfeit! [They fight and Sylla overcomes. Enter Valerius. Die, vile wretch! Base of the baseâplebeian of the plebsâ Dizzy with triumphâdrunk with some small fameâ Go, hide thee in the grave. [Marius is beaten down and disarmed. VALERIUS. Great Gods! 'Tis Sylla! Oh! that I had two hearts, for one is torn A thousand ways at once. I must be quick. Oh! hold great sirâfor your own sake, own honour, I pray you shed not bloodâsuch blood as that, On such a night as this. SYLLA. The night becomes The deed. The deed the blood!âand who art thou That interlopest thus? VALERIUS. Oh! sir, my name Is nought,âor else 'tis written on this wreath Given to a youth men call Valerius; Who 'cause he saved a greater than himself Is just thus more than nothing. I do pray you, Not for the sake of meânor yet of himâ But for your own great honour, that you shed not This bloodâperchance too riotousâyet young, And which may flow for Rome. SYLLA. Valerius!â Young man, what chance hath sent thee here those powers That guard us only know. Thy voice is fatal, For doom is on it,âand as thou hast come, Heaven knows to which side may the scale incline; But thou hast come,âI pray thee so believe it,â In a most happy or most heavy hour. That wreath of thine, giv'n for prolonging mine, Saves too this villain's breath. Take thy request. I quit him: let him go: but without word Or passage more; for if mine eye meet his, Nought can delay the fate that 's on this hour. Let him begone. I 'll speak to ye anon. [Turns to Flavia. YOUNG MARIUS (aside). If there be swords of poniards here in Rome, And hands to use themâthat will strike, for hate, Or fear, or gold,âthen will I be reveng'd! This hour is hisâmy time is yet to come. [Exit Young Marius. SYLLA. Why, pretty trembler! all is over now. Be calm. 'Tis Sylla that now speaks to you. Come, come! Young man, is the plebeian gone? I pray your pardonâ'twas the deed I glanc'd at And not the man. He is gone. The earth-sprung ruffian Is not AntÃ¦us! Come, sir; come Valerius, Take you this arm, and let us have some parley Of this strange outrage. Nay; you're safe now, Flavia, A warrior on each side, and crown'd ones too! Come, come!âno more of trembling;âcome! [They lead Flavia in. SCENE III. âThe Forum and Consul's chair. Enter two Citizens, meeting. FIRST CITIZEN. Sergius; well met! hast heard the news? SECOND CITIZEN. What news? FIRST CITIZEN. The life of Sylla hath been foully lanced at By hired assassins! set on, as 'tis said, By these illustrious Marii, or, at least, By Marius the younger, who doth rage 'Gainst Sylla, with all venom that together And love and hate can mingle. SECOND CITIZEN. Love and hate! For what? and whom? FIRST CITIZEN. For beauty; and 'gainst him Would keep it from him! Hark! they 're here; to seek For justice of the Consul! Now. Stand close! Enter Tubero with a crowd of Citizens; Lictors drag in a chained Gladiator. THIRD CITIZEN. Bring him before him! bring him 'fore the Consul! We will have justice. [The crowd cry âJustice, justice!â TUBERO. There;âplace him there. So. (Loudly.) Caius Marius, Consul!â The seat of justice is unfill'd, and Rome Must wait for retribution. 'Twas not thus, When Rome's patricians fill'd the Curule chair, And consulship was duty. Oh! he comes; We suitors are impatient! Enter Marius and Young Marius. (He sits down; Young Marius stands beside him; the chair is guarded by Lictors and armed men.) MARIUS. Whosoe'er Doth seek for justiceâasking it of Romeâ For aught that Rome protectsâhere let him speak, For here is justice. SYLLA (entering). I am glad to hear it, Lord Consul,âfor, methinksâor I must err Most grosslyâRome protects her citizens In life and wealâaye, and the innocence And honour of her matrons and her daughters. No more o' that. It is no aim of mine To stir the blood by artful preamble, Or barter truth for words. I ask for justice. My life hath been attempted by assassins, By whom instruct I know not: tho', Lord Consul, Haply, by your good zeal for law and justice, That quest may be unravell'd. MARIUS. Set the man Before me who has aim'd at this ill deed. 'Tis well.âNow, Lucius Sylla, let me ask, For such a question justice sure exacts, Was this a brawl? or stands this man accus'd Of homicide premeditateâcold murder? SYLLA. Some ground of quarrel there was sought; no doubt: That is most trueâbut sought premeditately. I say premeditately, and to further The ends of others;âfor what quarrel, sir, Could this man, this paid bravo, this kept ruffian, This stall-fed gladiator, have with Sylla? The wolf can have no quarrel with the lion, For enmity asks some equality; And 'tis concluded that the dog is mad That bays the moon. This, therefore, is a tool Of some, more great than he; and punishment, Without enquiry, were but semi-justice. MARIUS. This is no inquisition. I sit here As Consul, not accuser. Name the man, Who hath conspired against you; bring your proof, And justice shall be done. As for this fellow, Methinks the PrÃ¦tor should best deal with him, He hardly fits the forum. SYLLA. Are the lives Of Senators, men who have served their country, Grown of so little value, that the PrÃ¦tor Is judge enough for such? (Aside.) Now, Jove, avenger! My bosom bursts if 'tis not out?â(Aloud.) No, sir, I make my accusation 'fore the Consul. The man, who hath conspired against me, stands, Perhaps too near the judgment-seat; I say it, For that his name is Marius! YOUNG MARIUS. It is false! Your proofs?âWho knows, that yond man hath my gold? Who knows from what patrician treasury It cameâperchance to foster some vile brawl, And wreck the name of Marius? I deny The baseless accusation. MARIUS. Lucius Sylla, T' accuse a son before the judgment-seat, On which the father sits, is somewhat harshâ But let that pass. Yet still methinks the proofs, In such a case, should not consist of words! What visible motiveâliving evidenceâ Are there for this? Produce them. SYLLA. Visible motive?â That hatred which is ever child o' the sense Of mercy undeserv'd. Ill clemency, Requited by revenge. This man did violate The threshold of a noble Roman lady. I caught him in the deedâand I did spare him. YOUNG MARIUS. Gods! Is it then become a crime in Rome, For Marius to o'er-step patrician thresholds? Pardon me, sir;âperhaps, I did not knowâ Perhaps, I had no reason to believeâ That I was so unwelcome! MARIUS. Silence, both! I cannot listen to such controversies As this appears to be.â If you have proof To shew my son did instigate this man, Produce it. If not, I dismiss this cause. Words weigh not here: nor sit I here to judge Of a street brawl! SYLLA. Oh! Rome, dost thou hear this? What, shall the sanctity of a matron's door Be violateâand maiden innocence, Worst sacrilege! shrink before ruffian rudeness, And justice be denied us? Caius Marius! Consul! [Marius rises. No Consul, but a would-be King, Or worse than that, Dictator! I stand here For justice. Justice is denied in Rome! A Roman cannot find it! CITIZENS. You shall have it! Sylla! Sylla! Down with the Dictator! Down with the Tarquin! MARIUS. Ho! Lictors, keep the peace. This is a plot. Beat back the ruffians, Lictors! Am I Consul? Or is this Rome? [Sylla's friends draw, and the people join, shouting âSylla! Sylla! Down with the Dictator!â Marius' party beaten in. MARIUS. Silence! ungrateful wolves! Here is my breast; Pierce it, if 't be your pleasure. Nay, shrink not, This bosom fears not falchions. It hath bled Too often for you, and it shall not grieve To end such office! Nay then, farewell! I leave ye To the masters ye have chosen. Luxury And Pride, perchance, may bring ye softer hearts; And selfishness, that deifies e'en baseness, Deserve the people's love; that people whom It scorns too much to hate. So be it. I would not Stay here to mix in civil broil. The world Hath room enough; and Marius, like the swallow, Can seek another spring. Follow, me boy. [Exeunt Marius and his followers. FIRST CITIZEN. Drive them out at the gates! Away with the Tarquins? Some guard Sylla home. [All cry âSylla! Sylla!â SYLLA. I thank you, generous Romans, For this your kindness. Rome shall be Rome yet, Or Sylla shall lie low. Friends, I am yoursâ And oh! in after time remember this, 'Tis not for Pride that we now strikeâbut Justice. [Exeunt Sylla and Citizens. END OF THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Ruins of Carthage; the Ocean in the distance: the Moon rising. Enter Tubero, two Citizens of MinturnÃ¦, and Soldiers. FIRST CITIZEN. Amid this labyrinth of ruin'd walls 'Tis thought he lurks; and watches, in his turn, With the hyÃ¦na and the haggard wolf, The setting orb of day, meeting, the morn Like them, with blood-shot eye; here hoping aid From far but restless friends. To lure him hence Were half a miracle. TUBERO. We'll venture for 't. There is an old and ocean-cradled airâ 'Tis said a wafture from this Carthage hereâ Which, as a signal, the rude seamen sing Along the Thracian coasts; wild as the waves And rocks, to which 'tis kin. To Marius' ear 'Twas common from a child; and when in rage, Like one that's stung by the tarantula, I've seen it draw the venom from his breast With a most healing music. That wild strain I have set some to chorus from the sea. Haply 't will draw him forth, sounding like signal Of friends upon the main. FIRST CITIZEN. Let us stand close. There; where the rising moon beneath that buttress Casts solemn shadow, hardly pervious To aught but lynxes' eyes. Softly; there; there. [They retire stealthily. AIRâCHORUS. Lo! the crested billows, glancing, Like white-maned steeds advancing! 'Mid the darkness lo! the lightning O'er the anguish'd ocean bright'ning! Now engulf'd, our galley toiling; Now the breakers round her boiling; Not a star to twinkle o'er us; Waves behind, and night before us! 'Mid the restless, wild commotion, Of the storm-tormented ocean, Steady, seamen!âstill be steady; 'Mid all dangers, ever ready! Tho' to-night there's skies of sadness, 'Morrow brings us light and gladness: Darkling now may be our duty,â Day shall shew us joy and beauty! [Marius appears amongst the ruins and comes forward. MARIUS. Whence came that strain? It is, at least, no traitorâ No liar to the heart. For, even now, It stirs me, as, methinks, long since it did, In far-fled, happier hours, when life was new, And hope was high, when fame was bright, and sunset Had not become my morn! If friends of Marius Be on the deep, and this be from their tongue, Speed them, propitious Neptune! And thou, Moon, Shine, like some Pharos, on these mouldering towers, Gild each green wave that ripples past their prow, And with thy beam pilot and point their course, As with a silver wand.âThe strain hath ceas'd. Night falls apace. How awful is this spot!â Here fell the bolt of Scipio! And here Carthage, The naval crowned queen, blue Neptune's daughter, Strong as the storms, and richer than the seas, With all their untold gems, before the Roman Sank down in blood and ashes. Here, ev'n here, That swarthy Senate, dark as wintry waves, Was quell'd for ever! On these umber'd ruins The sun doth wonder why he shines; the moon Doth trim her silver lamp only to light The fox and owl, obscene, that haunt these walls; Aye or the grizzled wolf that couches there, And prowls amid their shadows, as if scent Of carnage still remain'd. You dank, black marsh, Where the coarse flag and bristling reed choke up, Mix'd with the fragments of the former time, The hot and stagnant waters, once did hold A thousand ships, that swept the azure seas In glorious domination. Yea; where now The melancholy her'n or peaceful crane Doth wade alone, a gay and varied throng Brought riches home from many a distant clime, And sung amid their toil. Oh! such a scene Doth fit the fate of Marius. Ruin to ruin! Deserted 'mid desertedâdeath in death! And yet is Rome more blest than this? Her streetsâ Do they not shelter wolves? Doth rapine never Stalk 'mid her walls? And 'mongst her stately throngs Is there more peaceâmore safetyâthan amid These awful relics of her fallen foe? Oh! no! the ghost of dark and ruin'd Carthage Is not more foul than is the living spirit Of yon, her fell destroyer! Hover round me, Gaunt, grimly spectre of a fallen state, For Marius is like thee; and, haply, soon Shall be with thee, e'en here! Enter from behind Tubero, Citizens, and Soldiers. TUBERO. 'Tis he; this winged vulture's caught at last, And now shall soar no further. [Comes forward. I' the Senate's name, For treason foul, and manifest rebellion, I do arrest thee, Caius Marius,âConsul,â But now the Senate's prisoner. MARIUS. (Aside.) 'Tis as I thought, Their bloodhounds are e'en here. (Aloud) By whom sent, sir? By what authority? TUBERO. By that of Sylla, Empow'r'd and armed by the Roman Senate, For safety of the state. MARIUS. (Aside.) For blood; for pride; For safety of patrician tyranny!â (Aloud.) Well, sir,âI am your prisoner, deal with me As it seems best to you and to your masters. TUBERO. You must accompany us unto MinturnÃ¦, And there await the Senate's pleasure. MARIUS. Sir, I go; nor wish delay. Where fear is not, Nor hope, 'tis all alikeâthe dungeon or The palace! Nay, lead on; I have nought to say,â Save this, my friend; and this e'en tell the Senate, Amid their triumph. When their pulse is high, And pride grows drunken over foes o'erthrown, And deems that now its sun shall never set, But that which had a dawn shall know no nightâ Tell them, amid their extacies o'er me, And these white hairs dishonour'd in the dust, Tell them, that thou beheldest Caius Marius Sitting 'mid ruin'd Carthage! Tell them this; For there 's a moral in 'tâa deep one too,â And worth the Senate's marking! Now, sir, lead onâ [Marius and Soldiers go out. FIRST CITIZEN. What is the Senate's pleasure as to this Unhappy man? Goes he to Rome? TUBERO. Not so. The Senate's orders are close custody; The rest is left to Sylla. FIRST CITIZEN. Be it so; We have dungeons deep enough. TUBERO. For Sylla's liking? Not so, believe me, sir! There's but one prison Sylla thinks strong enough for Caius Marius! FIRST CITIZEN. And what is that? TUBERO. The grave! You understand me. FIRST CITIZEN. I doâ(aside) too well. TUBERO. If that you would avoid Sylla's displeasure; aye, and more than that, Win his good favour,âyou will strait seek out Some resolute hand that 's fit for such a deed, And prompt to undertake it. For his reward, As well as yours, depend on 't, Sylla's bounty Shall fail not of your hope. FIRST CITIZEN (aside). The price of blood Is mostly paid, whatever else be left Ungifted and unguerdon'd! TUBERO. Sir! you answer not! FIRST CITIZEN. Your pardon, sir. I was in thoughtâand now I do bethink me. In the citadel There toils a slave; a Gaul, methinks, by race; Who seems as he were of the very stones That Pyrrha and Deucalion cast behind them To renovate mankind; hard as the rock On which he worksâto whom both tears and smiles Are equal strangers,âand who sits i' the sun, Not knowing that he shines. This clod of earth Shall do our work; and, if he's paid with freedom, Will be far over-paid. TUBERO. This is your business. Mine is to say, solely, âit must be done.â Come, let us see this fellow. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA Dungeon. Marius asleep on a couch. Enter First Citizen, followed by Lygdamis. FIRST CITIZEN. Softly!âhe sleeps. 'Tis well. Hist!âhither, fellow; Here, take this sword, and, on him who lies there Do present executionâwithout pause. LYGDAMIS. Ho! Kill him, in his sleep? CITIZEN. But only kill him, And take thine own way. See! All this is gold. Do thisâand freedom and that gold are thine. LYGDAMIS. Freedom for murder! Free to stab men sleeping! Who is 't that ye would kill? CITIZEN. What 's that to thee? Do it; and there is thy reward. Refuse; And we 'll find one shall do as much for thee. Rememberâand be promptâand speed thee well! [Citizen goes out. LYGDAMIS (looking at Marius). Well!âI am sent to kill this poor old manâ Here, on the couchâand sleeping too; and if I had a heart, as some men seem to have, Would I not shrink to dabble yon white hairs In blood?âaye, blood that 's innocent, perhaps!â I have no heart! Lygdamis' heart is dead; For love, and fear, and hope, are strangers all To the vile slave. Conquer'd; spar'd; sold to toil; Degraded; trodden on; mock'd; scourg'd; and scorn'd; Life is to him a blank, or worse than that; And, therefore, recks he not to take anothers, Who would with equal ease toss down his own. Thus, then, I earn my hire. [He prepares to strike. The old man stirs; I cannot strike him thus. Whate'er his features, His hairs are reverend white. MARIUS (struggling in his dream). Hah! hah!âwell put!â Well struck! but 't will not do!âno. NowâI have theeâ Down with thee!âyield, thee, Gaulâdown, 'tis in vain! Thou art mine, giant! [Marius starts on his feet. He and Lygdamis glare on each other. Lygdamis trembling violently. MARIUS. Who art thou? and wherefore Art thou come hither? Speak! LYGDAMIS (with great difficulty.) To murder thee! MARIUS (after looking at him long and intently.) Thou murther Marius? Why! ere I awoke I saw that quailing eye? Do I not know thee? What? Thou! whom in that red Numantian field I vanquished and then spared!âThou more than slave, Whose very breath is almsâwho hold'st thy life On sufferance merelyâwho defraud'st the kites Of that which then was theirsâfor I lack'd not Thy clumsy limbs and huge anatomyâ What! Thou kill Caius Marius! [Lygdamis drops his sword. Thou dost well! This is no feat for thee. Go tell thy masters, If they would murder Marius, they must send A better instrument! Begone. [A trumpet sounds. Young Marius, Saturninus, &amp;c., rush hastily in. YOUNG MARIUS. Down with the ruffian! Thank th' immortal Gods Marius yet lives! Marius. Harm him not. He 's a friend. What does this mean? SATURNINUS. It means that Caius Marius Shall yet be seven times Consul! Sylla's pride Hath oped the eyes o' th' people, who now say Give us back Mariusâoften injured Marius! The stay o' the Commonwealth! The greater worn, Aye, and alarm'd, with thirst insatiate Of blood and never-tired proscriptions, wrung By fear-own'd debts or base life-ransoms, look Cold and averse, and Rome but waits for Marius To shake off her dictatorâall Campania, By Glabrio rous'd, and his Illyrian cohorts, E'en now is in rebellion. MARIUS. Sir, Rome never In vain shall wait for Marius. Boy, your hand. Have with you, sirs. And come thou too, good fellow, I know thee, and will find thee better service Than killing Caius Marius. As for you, (Citizens kneel.) I know that force compelled you to the deed. You 're pardon'd. As we go along, my friends, You 'll tell me all hath chanc'd. Follow me, sirs, Justice goes hand in hand, now, with Revenge! [Exeunt Omnes. SCENE III. âRome. A Chamber. Flavia alone. FLAVIA. Alas! what load of grief wing'd time can carry, And oh! how swiftly bear it! O! how brief The little space since I could say that never I had known pain or fearâand now, too well With both, I am familiar: Sylla exiledâ My mother absentâand our enemies (I shudder at the thought), the lords of Rome And Roman destinies. Great Gods protect me! Not to be known is now my only safety: Obscurity my refuge. Heav'ns! who's here? (Enter Valerius.) Valerius!â VALERIUS. Now all blessings that the gods Store up for innocence and grace await thee, And ever be about theeâFlavia! FLAVIA. Valeriusâ What do'st thou here? VALERIUS. Flaviaâwhat do I here? When thou 'rt in peril, say where should I be? FLAVIA. Oh! but thou know'st the dangerâthe dread risk! Thou know'st that Marius is our enemy. Well, thou do'st know all that hangs o'er us now, And what fell passions wait on this sad hour!â If thou wert traced hereâ [Shudders, and pauses. Why, wilt thou risk A life so precious for the sake of one, Who, if she own'd a hundred times the means, That in these civil tempests e'er she can, Could ne'er repay thee? VALERIUS. Risk a life for thee!â Why, that I 've done for cold and formal duty; That would I do for sake of innocence, Howe'er endanger'dâRisk my life!âI've don 't Even for a soldier-like punctilioâ A thing of drum and passwordâbut for theeâ Oh! let me use some other better word: Let me for thee say I'd lay down my life, Happyâbecause assured one tear of thineâ One priceless tearâwould drop upon my grave, And consecrate the flowers that there, thenceforward, Methinks would grow for everâthro' all change, Changelessâe'en like his love who lay below. FLAVIA. This is wild talk Valerius! VALERIUS. It may be so, Flavia, tho' it be sweet. Let me be calm then For calmness now is duty. Hear me Flavia: Rome isâthe heav'ns do see 'tâno place for thee Till these dark times be gone. I'm weary of them; But let that passâand my solicitude,â All that disturbs the rest of poor Valerius, Is, that thou should'st be safe. Thou shalt be so, If that thou wilt confide in me, and link (Oh! trust too precious!) for a few short hours, Thy destinies with mine. FLAVIA. Valerius! I amâas well thou know'stâa helpless outcast, Scarce worth a thoughtâbut were I twenty times More than I am, I would confide in thee. I pray thee say no more upon this themeâ At least, not now, Valerius! VALERIUS. Not now, Flavia! Oh! were I sureâsure that another nowâ Some happier hour than thisâsome summer hourâ Some halcyon momentâborn of azure skies, And nurs'd in sunshineâwere in store for us, Then would I speak no more. Alas! this darkness May notâoh! God, that I should say the word! May never find a morn; and therefore, Flavia, I will speak one word more upon this theme And ask thee but to hear itânot to answer, Save by such hearing. I do love thee, Flavia,â Love thee above what eloquence could tell, With such an hour as this to utter it. What would'st thou sayâ? FLAVIA. Oh! talk not so, Valerius, At such an hour as this: but let us rather Pray that these troubles shall be well o'er past And summer smile again;âthat goodness may Have breathing time, and better suns come round When innocence hath safety. VALERIUS. Only say That when that summer comes, thy breath to me Shall bring not winterâonly say thou wilt not O'ercloud this halcyon timeâHeaven send it soonâ And I am blest. FLAVIA. (Faintly) Oh! noânoâno, Valeriusâ VALERIUS. No more!âoh no word more!âthat tremulous silence, Is breath enough for me! Time flies apace. We that are perill'd must be firm, my Flavia, When firmness is best love. Come in with me; There's yet an hour to spare,âand thy departure Shall soon be plann'd. But ere we go, first tell me, Can'st thou, dear Flavia, trust in that old slave That tends upon thee? FLAVIA. I know not, Valerius. One time methought I could; but treachery now Methinks doth enter at our very casements, Ev'n with the air we breathe! VALERIUS. It is too true! We will not trust her. Let me tend on thee, And tremble not. Flavia, the day will come When we, who shake, shall smile at this dark hour! Come, cheer thee, dearest Flavia. [They go in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âOne of the Gates of Rome. (Flourish of trumpets.) Enter Marius, Valerius, Young Marius, Sulpicius, Officers, and others. MARIUS. They are repuls'd then? YOUNG MARIUS. Scatter'd, like the leaves By a November whirlwind. MARIUS. It is well. Let them flee back to Sylla; and to him Tell their mishap! What news of him? YOUNG MARIUS. He is Within ten leagues of Rome, 'tis saidâ VALERIUS (aside). But ten! Then, Flavia, thou art safe. At least my hope Cannot but think soâ YOUNG MARIUS. They report, he left PrÃ¦nestÃ¨ garrison'dâand I fear his strength Sanction'd as muchâtoo well. What are his plans, Perchance we 've brought you one can better say. MARIUS. Whom? YOUNG MARIUS. Tuberoâthe senatorâhis friend! Him we have ta'enâhard on his road to Sylla; And in disguise! I fear me as a missive From traitors, here, in Rome. MARIUS. What! i' th' Senate? Ah! Aristocracyâsleek homicideâ As hollow as the hemlock, and more deadly; Furr'd like the ermineâtalon'd like the pardâ With heart of venom, and with breath of balm; Still wilt thou tear the hand that pats thee? Race, Born to lap blood; let blood then be your doom! Bring in the traitor. (Tubero is brought in.) Welcome! sir! Thou com'st Well tim'd! We want thy information. Aye! And as our need is, so must be our means. Tell what thou know'st. 'Tis well! Refuse. The rack Shall wring it from thee. Now thou know'st our mind. TUBERO. I knew 't before! Think'st thou the Marian kind Can be mistaken? Or that any man Ere coupled mercy with the sound of Marius? I see my fate; and am prepared to meet it. Enough. Know then, my errand was to Sylla! To hasten his approach; and well assure, No man in Rome, unless for fear or gold, Will strike a blow for Marius! MARIUS. Say'st thou so? Insolent slave! But he shall soon try that. Where is he? Speak. TUBERO. He is within ten leagues I know of Rome; and with a pow'r that thou And thy stall-fed plebeians shall wax pale at. Farewell. I speak no more. MARIUS. Thou hast said enough! Your best intelligence is ever brief. Thou shalt have speedy largess for thy news. Take him away! and let the axe forestall His place in Sylla's triumph! (Tubero is taken out.) Gentlemen, Time presses. We must act. Son, go, take order Within the Capitol. And thou, Valerius, See that the walls are triply mann'd. Dispose Strong out-posts, east, from the Flaminian gate, And change them every hour. By such relief Treachery may best be baffled. To thy zeal I trust this service. See to 't well. Take heed Such charge be not misusedâand let no cause Tempt thee to quit thy post, ev'n for an hour. Farewell! [Exit Valerius. Come son! [Exit Marius. YOUNG MARIUS. I follow,âsir,âin a breath! [He walks about disturbed. 'Tis saidâthose in the crisis of their fate Are buoyant oft of spirit, and mount high, Or ere they sinkâas if the soul elateâ Rose on the waves of fortune. Shipwreck'd wretches,â Men shut in plague-struck cities,âwill, they say, Make revelry, and play strange freaks o' th' brain Amid fate's very billows. Even thus, Methinks, it is with me. If in this conflict I perish, I will sneak not to my urn Like a gull'd priest of Cybele! but die Satiate (if that may be) with fierce delight; The greatestâif the lastâthat fate can give me; And sweeter, because hard to be obtain'd, And dash'd with perturbation. I am tost Upon a sea of passion: but my course There are two burning stars to guide. The one Oh! Love is thine,âthe other isâRevenge! Enter Ctesiphon. Ha! art thou there? CTESIPHON. I am, my lord. YOUNG MARIUS. Speak quickly; For I am rack'dâam mad with this suspense! Hast trac'd out her concealment? CTESIPHON. Sir, I have. YOUNG MARIUS. Art sure on'tâor art sure that, if thou hast, Thy foot-prints are unseen;âand thou, who track'st, May'st not be track'd? CTESIPHON. Sir, all is safeâall sure! And as an earnest of this certainty, I give you here my hand, and promise you They 're in your power this nightâthis very night! And here 's the earnest. YOUNG MARIUS. Rapture! ecstacy!â Methought he chang'd, when he receiv'd his charge.â Hand did'st thou say? Aye, give it me! Nor shall it For thisâperhaps, last serviceâpart from me Unguerdon'd. Take this gold. Until to night I part not from thee. Then; when we have sped As thou assurest me,âI'll give thee means To quit this scene of blood and violenceâ Whate'er becomes of Marius. Come with me; And let us make success a thing of fate.â If I must perish now, let Marius die Triumphant to the last. Favour'd of love, And in such sort as man was never yet! Or, if not that, victorious in revenge.â Come, counsellor. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA Garden and Villa. Night. Enter Valerius, with a cloak. VALERIUS. Now, oh! ye starsâthat gaze on this drear night From out yond shadowy dome, if it be possible, As men do say, that some of ye can be Malignantâhide your lightsâand if those question, Who spell the heav'ns for words of fate, and read, Writ in your course, the doom of enemies, Answer notâI beseech ye. But oh! suffer Your beams, ye orbs, that smile on innocence, To lamp our darkling steps, and, 'mid the snares Of lust and murder, guide our umber'd way.â She comes?ânot yet. How is 't with thee, oh Rome, That those, who would die for thee, seek to leave thee? Oh! that thou should'st become a den for factions To tear each otherâand men seek to rule thee Whose empire still is ruin! I'st not thus? E'en as the wintry gusts and ruins contend Which shall be masterâthat fell masterdom Whichever has 't, is ravage!âthe wide waste Of giant inundationâor the sweep And reckless triumph of the winged wind! So is it with thee, Rome: thou still must suffer, O'ermaster thee who may. Flavia! she comes! Too bright a beam for such a night as, Rome, Doth now enshroud thee; fallen queen o' the world, Obscured in blood and tearsâ FLAVIA (entering). Valerius! VALERIUS. My Flavia! Tremble not. Do not yond stars Look down on this dark hour? and innocence In heav'n, if not in Rome, is sacred. Flavia, Time presses, and ere morn we must be far From danger and from Rome. FLAVIA. But one last look at this beloved home!â And then I go, Valerius! Enter Young Marius and Attendants. YOUNG MARIUS. Save you, lady;â And, you, sir!âWe 're well met! although, methinks, 'Tis a new hour for travelâin such times, And without passports, too! At least I cannot Well think, that Sylla's niece and Marius' vassal Were bent on open journey. If mistaken, Tis easily put right. VALERIUS. Wretch YOUNG MARIUS. Ha!âBe this As 't may, this is no hourâno path for beauty To venture forth unguarded. This fair lady I will protect as doth become her. Thou May'st take thy way, e'en as it pleaseth thee. I shall not condescend to stop thy course, Deserter!âPatron leaver!âFugitive! Sylla, perchance, may need thee. Marius, haply, Can shift without such succour! VALERIUS. Art thou a Roman? Art of that noble race who have inscribed Those banners, waved so oft in victory, âPeace to the cottage; to the tyrant war; âWe spare the lowly, and strike down the proud!â Call'st thyself âRomanââand wilt do a deed Accurs'd by all Rome's Gods,âwhose temples, sure, Are the best guards of innocence and virtue?â Thou canst not do this, Marius! YOUNG MARIUS. Prate no more! I came not here to listen to thy whine! Quit thou the lady, and e'en take thy course Whither thou wilt. If not, ye are attach'd The spies of Sylla and the Consul's foes, And traitors to the Senate and the State. Now;âtake thy choice. FLAVIA. My choice is ta'en, Valerius! Let him arrest us,âlet his savage father Doom us to death, or torment,âor to both! There is no terror in such death, Valerius, To those who truly loveâbelieve 't there is notâ No agonyâno pain!â'Tis but to bless them, To join two souls, in essence one already; And the last sigh that wafts them to each other Is sweeter far than zephyr's, and more kindly E'en than the gentle spring's. Oh! in such breath Live twenty summers, in their bloom of beauty, With all their smiling suns; and to die thus Is then to live indeed. Mine own, my brave, My dear Valerius, thouâthou hesitate! VALERIUS. I do not, Flaviaâno! no! Marius! monster! No, no. It cannot be. Thou dost but try me. There are some deeds impossible on earth, Or how should there be hell? Thou dar'st not do it. And hast, methinks, hardly the heart to say it. YOUNG MARIUS. Fool not thyself, Valerius. Yield her to me, Or all those hopes are dreams;âfalse as the winds; Fleeting and unsubstantial, as the foam Left on the bright shore of some summer sea. Speak but the word. She lives. FLAVIA. An if he did,â If that 't were possible such baseness could Exist in aught that Flavia says she loves, Think'st thou he 'd speak for me? Oh! no, no, no Rather than that, I'd do as Lucrece did, But quicker far than Lucrece. Dost thou shrink, Valerius? Oh! an if I thought thou could'st,â Muchâ(and there is no shame to say it now)â As I have lov'd thee,âI should deem of thee But as that blotch'd, rank flow'r, toad-like, that seems As nature made it to shew how a flower May out-do e'en things loathsomeâand even thus Turn from thee, could I think that such a thought Could ever shame that bosom. (To Marius.). Threaten'st thou Death?âFoolish ruffian, to imagine e'en That death out-uglied thee! I do defy thee, Thee and thy race; and if ye think to mend Your blood by spilling better than your own, Seize the occasion! Come, Valerius. YOUNG MARIUS. Have then thy will. Away with them! VALERIUS. One moment. Caius,âwe have been friends. That 's little. For Myself I reck not; but I would save thee, Ev'n for that friendship's sake, from such a deed As men, however black, would tremble at. Look on that faceâAnd whatsoe'er become Of me, oh! injure not a bosom, which Innocence self might make her latest refuge, And grace make doubly gracious, when disgrac'd In every heart beside. Oh! can such beauty Sort with such sound as death? YOUNG MARIUS. Sir! If that death Be doom'd,âthat doom fell from no lip of mine. Silence I sayâI'll hear no more. Death hath Been spoken. After that there 's but one word Can follow. 'Tis revenge! Take them away! If love be scorn'dâthen why should fury stay! [Exeunt. SCENE III. âThe Capitol. Enter Marius armed, Saturninus, and others. MARIUS. Let all the walls be mann'd, without more pause, And let Cecilius and his chosen cohorts Be drawn within the Capitol. This rock Ere now hath been Rome's saviour; and again Shall beâso please the Godsâif Marius Be narrow'd to its confines. Saturninus. SATURNINUS. Great Sir! MARIUS. I'll perish on this rocky heart Of Rome, ere budge one inch to Sylla. S'life! Is order sent to bid Cecilius Bring in his cohorts? OFFICER. It is done, Lord Consul. [Trumpet sounds. MARIUS. 'Tis well. Enter Sulpicius. Sulpicius, welcome! What's the news? SULPICIUS. Sylla 's at hand, Lord Consul; and his power Is not to be contemn'd. E'en at this moment, Rome is environ'd from the CÅlian To the Flaminian gate!âand o'er the walls They have lanced this proclamation, setting price On both the Consuls' heads. [Gives a paper. MARIUS (reading aside). So. They have priced me, as they would a wolf! No matter. Yet, methinks, the head of Marius Were worth a few denarii more than his They 've honour'd by a like proscription! Well: When they have got them, they 'll be little worth, And of most even value! (Aloud.) Is this all? To pay for murder is not new in Rome!â Is there nought else? SULPICIUS. There is, my lord: and that More nearly touches us. I fear me treason Lurks 'mid our troops; and some that should be true Are making peace with Sylla. MARIUS. âTraitors,â say 'st thou? Amongst our nearest? Then all 's over! Death Shall be our pass-word now; and Marius die As he hath liv'd, stern to his enemies! Enter Young Marius, with Valerius, Flavia, and Attendants. What 's here? YOUNG MARIUS. I know not. But I fear me treason. [Marius starts. Well may you start, my lord, at such a sound, At such a time, of one so lov'dâso trusted! Such is the world; at least so 'tis at Rome! This gallant hereâto whomâif gratitude Were now a thing in fashion, such a course Were worse than deathâwe have waylaid and ta'en Upon his road to Sylla; who, it seems, Is now again the Orient, and so worshipp'd Of all who knee the rising sun. VALERIUS. 'Tis false! And thou, who say'st it know'st that I am true. I may have sought to save beauty and virtue From fangs like thine; but treason never yet Was inmate with Valerius. MARIUS. Beauty, forsooth! Ha! And whence comes this syren who hath caused This sudden zeal for chastity? Whence comes she? Answer me thatâ(pauses) By heavens the foolish boy Is right enough; there 's poison in her eye. The true patrician guile. Hold up thy head. By Jove, the rainbow eyebrowâand the lashes Like silken fringe of finest woofâI 've seen Ere now!âWhence com'st thou, damsel? FLAVIA. From the house Of Lucius Sylla. Start'st thou?âNever think I heed thy frown, old man! Oh! no. The blood That 's in these veins knows not of fearâlike that! This let me sayâand freely I do say it, Despite thee, Caius Mariusâif there be treason I am the traitress! I did lure this youth; By the fond love he bears meâand which love I do return; to rescue me from Romeâ Which thou hast made a theatre for blood, For cruelty!âAye! rageâand gnash thy teeth, Base, heartless, hoary-headed ruffian! MARIUS. Girl! Beware!âThis is no placeâthis is no hour For woman's trifling. Mark!âTempt not thy fate; Tis on a breath. Be wise, and speak no more. FLAVIA. Yes! I will speak! I scorn thee and thy mercyâ If that thy race could know what mercy is! [Marius beckons a Soldier. Ayeâwhet thy knife upon thy villain's heart, Stony with murder. Let it have its way! MARIUS. This is thy last. Out with thy blade, thou fellow. This is the last act of the seven-times Consul! Thinks't thou, thine eyes of diamond, and that hue, Would match the Alpine snows, when the young morn Doth tint their coldness with a roseate blush, Shall dazzle Marius? Thou dost speak to one Pric'd like a wolfâand like a wolf he shall Lap all the blood he meets. [To Young Marius Begone, hot fool! This is no time for dalliance! Kneel down, syren, And ask the Gods what wilt. One single minute I give thee. 'Tis thy last. VALERIUS. Oh! break my heart! Marius!âthou art a father. I was wont To call thee so in far-gone, happier hours Look on her. Thou'rt a man? MARIUS. I was a man; But Rome's patricians can work miracles, And I am man no longer. Talk no more: Thy turn comes on apace. [To Flavia. Quick! make thee ready VALERIUS. Flavia!âmy Flavia! FLAVIA. Tremble not, Valerius; I tremble not! Believe 't 'tis nought, Valerius, Or but the acting of a marriage rite That leads us to Elysium. Oh! so view it; And see thou bid me not âfarewell!â But rather Think that we only meetânowâin this hour! This only let me ask. Perhaps it may be A woman's fantasy,âbut do not look On me, Valerius, when that I am dead. Thou can'st not see me then,âunless 't were possible That thou could'st see my heart;âthen thou would'st know, That I did die, with my last thought on thee. Oh! grasp my hand till I shall kneel. I would not Their ruffian touch should aid one step of mine; And when that I have kneltâthen turn away Thy face, and speak no moreâ [She kneels. One kissâ'tis over! Enter Officer in haste. OFFICER. Consul, the city's yielded! all is treason! Cecilius is slaughter'd, and his cohorts Make strong the opposite ranksâall 's on the cast, And Sylla near at hand. The Senate hath Proclaim'd thee traitorâthee and thine; and offer'd Gold unto him or them shall bring you in, Dead or alive! MARIUS (in a transport of rage). Slaves! Cowards! Ermin'd wolves! Alive!âwhat? know not, yet, the dotards, Marius? Alive!âto kneel to Sylla and his Senate! Let me have breath, oh! rage! Stop me not yet! Sleek, brindl'd tiger! He, at least, shall feel; And blood be paid for blood. Oh! vengeance! vengeance! I'll drink thee to the dregs; for thou art sweet. Now for one blow, that shall avenge thee, Caius! Make ready, slave. Aye, if the very heavens Should weep to see this deed; yea, earth turn sick, And hell itself shrink from 't;âit should be done, Despite of even hell! Aye; blood! I chokeâ Oh! hate,âbar not thyself; and in thy rage Change place with whining pity! Scorpion-like Die not by thine own venom! But one breath, Ye Furies!âone breath moreâgive 't me. My brain Doth burstâmethinks! One breathâbut oneâoneâwordâ StriâStrike! [As he utters the last words, he reels, and falls down dead at Flavia's feet. Valerius seizes the Soldier's sword. VALERIUS. Ruffian! Hell shrinks from this, and mighty heaven Doth strike for innocence now. You, soldiers! Romans! And murther helpless women! YOUNG MARIUS. Strike him down! Seize him, I say! Traitors! VALERIUS. Keep off! I warn you. In such a cause I can lose twenty lives! Who closes with meâdies! (A crash of trumpets, and loud shouts of âSylla! Sylla!â Young Marius drops his sword!) SYLLA (without). Turn thee! thine hour is come, Mariusâthou man of blood! 'T is Sylla calls. Make way, I say. Where art thou, Caius Marius? Enter Sylla, Soldiers, &amp;c. (Valerius stepping forward; taking the sword from his hand, pointing to Marius' body. There! [Curtain drops. FINIS.</field>
