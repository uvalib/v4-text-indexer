      <field name="fulltext">FAIR ROSAMOND. A DRAMATIC SCENE. The following scene is chiefly taken from the popular ballad of the same name in Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. Some anachronisms will, I fear, be found, besides those contained in the beautiful legend which forms the groundwork of my story; but at an age so remote, and with a subject, to say the best of it, apocryphal, a strict adherence to the old tradition will hardly be demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Henry the Second, King of England. Queen Eleanor. Fair Rosamond. Constance, Rosamond's woman. Mabel, Rosamond's woman. Archers, &amp;c. attending on the King and Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene. An Apartment in Rosamond's bower at Woodstock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Constance meeting Mabel. Constance. Alone, good Mabel? Hath not our fair lady Won homeward from the chase? Mabel. But now I left her In the great hall, prattling right merrily To Pierce the white-haired forester, the old And merry forester. Hark! thou may'st hear Her sweet wild laughter now, echoing along The gallery. Hark! hark! How like a gay And reckless child! and how the old man's voice Comes chuckling in between! Constance. What makes he here? Mabel. He came to warn our lady to retire Within her secret bower, and triply guard The outer gate. He dreads a quick surprise From powerful foes. Constance. And Reginald Fitz-Urse, The valiant captain of the guard, hath gone This very morn to Warwick, to attend His dying father. None remain save raw And ignorant striplings. What hath scared old Pierce? Mabel. A clerk of Oxford passing through the chase Brought tidings that last night a royal train Reposed within the city, he believed The Queen herselfâbut Lady Rosamond Had yester-eve fond missives from the king Whom she expects at noon; and makes a mock Of Pierce's warning, mimicking the dull And purblind scholar who mistook her bright And peerless Henry for the stiff and gaunt And withered Eleanor; dancing for glee, Clapping her hands and laughing at each turn Of her quick fancy, gentle as young lambs Midst all her gambols, and more beautiful Than blossoms of the field. 'Tis a light heart. Constance. Think'st thou so? Mabel. Surely. Constance. Hast thou dwelt with her A two months' space, and deem'st her light of heart? Mabel. Full surely. Grant that sometimes she will weep The long day through, and watch the tedious night, Yet soon the veriest trifle will relume Her smile of joy. Constance. Ay, for an hour, and then To tears again. She bore a light heart, Mabel, When I first knew her in her father's halls. Oh what a peerless flower the spoiler's hand Marred in the cropping!âpoor, poor Rosamond! Mabel. Sure she is happy when king Henry comes. Constance. Ay then, for with idolatry so blind She loves her royal lover, that each look, Each thought, each feeling is absorbed in that Fond worship. In those brief and stolen hours Fair Rosamond is happy; but they leave Remorse behind. She comes. Enter Rosamond. Rosamond. How now, good maidens! Ye are sad to-day. Constance, hath Mabel told thee Of Pierce and that same learned clerk? I've laughed Till I'm a-weary, girl. Constance. Yet, gracious lady, Were it not wiser to withdraw awhile Within the secret bower? Rosamond. Dost thou believe That legend, Constance? Hath thy woman's fear So mastered thee that thou too dost mistake King Henry's plumed helm for the starched coif Of haughty Eleanor? And yet I thank thee, Thy fears spring from thy love. Go take my purse To good old Pierce; the faithful wretch is full Of honest care. [Exit Constance. Now reach my broidery, Mabel, The flowered scarf. Last night I dreamt of flowers, What may that dream denote? Mabel. Good, surely madam. Rosamond. Chiefly of roses. Mabel. Certes, lady, good. Rosamond. 'Twas looking on the scarf reminded me Of that gay dream. Methought I was a spirit In a bright world made up of sun and flowers, A lonely spirit, and my task to deck A vast triumphal temple, such as pilgrims Tell of in far-off countries, to entwine Rich garlands round its thousand fluted shafts Of whitest alabaster. There I sate Framing my wreaths profuse of various flowersâ For every flower was there of every hue And of all seasons;âthere I sat and sang, Bathed in the fragrance of light sunny showers, And plied my joyful task; or gladlier rose And flitted on light pinions, round and round The snowy columns twisting single wreaths, Or richly interlacing, or from shaft To shaft suspending the superb festoon Like an inverted rainbow. There they hung Unwithered, fresh, as on the parent bough, Nourished by the sweet air; and there I plied My task unweariedâtill the robin's song Rang through the casement and awakened me: Now what may that dream bode? Mabel. Good, good, dear lady. Rosamond. Say'st thou so, wench? 'Tis a fair augury. Where hast thou laid the threads of gold? Will that Be like the PensÃ©e?âSo the Normans call The pretty blossom, but our English maids Give it a dearer name, the sweet heart's-ease; This scarf is for king Henry. I must not Forget the heart's-ease.âConstance loiters long. Mabel. Shall I go call her? Rosamond. No. When she returns We'll ask her for some merry roundelay, Some pleasant ditty of Provence; for Constance, Staid and demure although she be, hath store Of mirthful minstrelsy. I would beguile The hour till Henry comes,âmy princely Henry, My king, my love. Mabel. He comes to-day? Rosamond. To-day, At noon to-dayâOh how I love to speak Over and over the glad words which tell His coming, as if that blest time were made By every repetition doubly sure. He comes at noonâwhen yonder shadow cast From the rich oriel window, even lies Upon the floor, thou'lt hear the tramp of steeds And clang of trumpets and the rapid tread Of his light foot. At noonânot sooner, wench; For he is punctual as beseemeth one Whose will is clock to many, nor foreruns The hour of meeting though 'tis me he meets. At noon, when yonder sluggish shadowâsurely 'Tis fixed in one eternal slope!âlies straight Upon the floor. How blest shall I be then!â Till then how slow and weary is the pause, How long the last sad melancholy hour Of expectation! Mabel. 'Twill soon pass, dear lady! Rosamond. Pass! Look how yonder shadow sleeps! 'T had past More lightly in the woods midst falling leaves And short quick flight of birdsâBut then I might Have missed him, and so lost sweet precious minutes Of his brief stay, or have encountered him Midst the keen gazes of his knightly train, And so have lost the o'erflowing gush of joy At our first meeting. In this oriel chamber He looks to find me still; I'll wait him here. The shadow stirs not. Mabel. If thou would'st but cease To watch it, gentle lady, or could'st think On any theme save oneâ Rosamond. Could think on aught Save him!âOh thou hast never loved!âCould speak Of aught save Henry, when each moment brings him Nearer to these fond arms. If thou had'st loved Thou would'st have known that I must talk of him And of him only. Mabel. Not of thy fair children? Rosamond. Not even of them. Yet would that they were here My pretty gentle Geoffrey, and that boy Elder and bolder, my stout William,âhe, Who at some six years old already draws His father's sword, already flashes forth His father's spiritâmy brave knightly boy! Oh would that they were here, to shed fresh charms On this blest meeting! to make wholly perfect Their mother's happiness! Mabel. They dwell apart By the King's orders? Rosamond. Ay, for their more safety. The jealous Queen in her stern cruelty Threatened to seize the innocent babes; and he, My HenryâOh with what a tenderness He won me to resign them! My own Henry! Lies not the shadow straighter? Mabel. Somewhat, madam. Rosamond. 'Twill soon be even. Did I never tell thee The story of his wooing? Listen, girl, Sit here and listen. 'Twas a glorious day, A glorious autumn day, as bright and clear As this, the small white clouds now softly sailing Along the deep blue sky, now fixed and still, As the light western breeze, arose or sank By fitsâA glorious day! I and my maids Sat by the lakelet in my father's park Working as we do now; right merrily, For young and innocent maids are in their nature Gay as the larks above their heads. The scene Was pleasant as the season; not a spot Of the Lord Clifford's wide demesne could vie With this in beauty. Woods on every side Ash, oak, and beech, sloped downward to the clear And quiet waters, overhung by tufts Of fern and hazel and long wreaths of briars, Only one little turfy bank was free From that rich underwoodâthere we sate bending Over a tapestry loom, until we heard A horn sound right above us, and espied A hunter threading the rude path which wound To our sequestered bower. Oh what a sight It was! the managed steed, white as the foam Of some huge torrent, fiery, hot, and wild, Yet reined into a tameness by his bold And graceful rider, winning with slow steps His way mid those huge trees; now seen, now lost, Now in bright sunshine, now in deepest shade; The red autumnal tints of those old woods Contrasting well the huntsman's snow-white steed And garb of Lincoln green. No sign bore he Of prince or king, save in the sovran grace Of his majestic port, his noble brow, His keen commanding eye. My maidens fled Soon as they saw the stranger. Mabel. And thou, lady? Rosamond. Why I too thought to fly, but loitered on Collecting the bright silks and threads of gold, Careful excuse that to myself I made For lingering there, till he approached; and then When I in earnest turned to go, he stayed me With such a smile and such a grace, and craved My aid so piteously, for he had lost Comrades and hounds and quarry and himself In that morn's chase, that I was fain to proffer Guidance to our old castle. Mabel. He went with thee? Rosamond. No. At Lord Clifford's name he started.âMabel, Shun thou the lover that shall start to hear Thy father's name.âWith slight excuse he rode To seek his partners of the chase. But oft From that day forth we met beside the lake;â And often when November storms came fast, Driving against the casement, I have wept Drop for drop with the sky, if my dear father In his fond care forbad his Rosamond To brave the raging tempest; all my heart Was in that bare damp wood and on the bank Of that dark water, where my lover stood To wait my coming, patiently as sits The nightingale beside his brooding mate. How could I chuse but love him? Mabel. Didst thou know Thy lover for the king? Rosamond. Not till my love Had been confessed; then he in turn confessed The fatal secret. What a coil of wild And desperate passions woke within my heart Fear, shame, and pride, and anger, but true love O'ermastered all; we fled, and I am here. Mabel. Alas! Rosamond. Nay, wherefore cry, Alas?âMy Fatherâ I must not think of himâOut on thee, wench! That sigh of thine hath saddened me, hath brought Fond thoughts of days of oldâthe blessed days When I was innocent and happy! Girl, Thou hast a father, an old white-haired man Who loves thee. Leave him not, I charge thee, Mabel! Bring not those white hairs to the grave with shame For thy foul sin! Mabel. Oh weep not, dearest lady! Look how the shadow hath crept on! and surely I hear a clamour at the gateâ (Noise without.) A tumult Even in the Hall. Dost thou not hear? Rosamond. 'Tis he, My king! my Henry! Quick, let's meet him!âNo, I must first dry my tearsâYet did I ever Meet Henry without tears?âWhere loiters he? Mabel. And what may mean that cry? The noise comes near; Heaven grant that all be well! Enter Constance. Rosamond. Hath aught befallen The King? Is Henry safe? Speak! Speak! Constance. Fly, Madam, Fly to the secret chamber. Our brave knights Are overpowered; and we undone. The Queen Approaches. Enter Queen Eleanor, Guards, &amp;c. Eleanor. Minion, she is here. Fly not, Proud concubine. Rosamond. I think not of it. Eleanor. Guard Each entrance well that she escape not. Women, Stand from about her. Wherefore kneel'st thou there? Rosamond. For mercyâOh thy looks are terribleâ For mercy and for pardon. Eleanor. Dar'st thou kneel To me for pardon? Dost thou know me? Rosamond. Yes; Thou art a Queen, a mighty Queen, but still A woman!âWomen should be pitiful, Great Queens should pardon. Eleanor. I am Henry's wife. Dost ask for mercy now? Aye sob, and shiver, And dash thy face against the ground, and lie Prostrate before me, minion. 'Tis my hourâ (To one of her attendants.) Bring in the bowl, good Hubert!âI have been A mockery of a Queen, whilst thou hast borne The power, the state, the reverence; enshrined Within thy bower, like some vile Indian Idol, Partner of Henry's heart, and more than partner Of the fool people's love. The very courtiers Grey-bearded counsellors, and valiant knights And learned Bishops all have brought their suits To Rosamond, fair RosamondâI'll mar That boasted beauty.âBring the bowl, I say.â Where be her sons? Rosamond (starting up). Oh Heaven is merciful! They are not here! They are safe! Their innocent lives Are spared! I thank thee, Lord, that in thy pity Refused the mother's prayer. My boys are safe! Eleanor. I'll reach them, harlot, yet. Rosamond. Oh no, thou wilt not. Thou art a mother; thou hast boys as young As mine, aye, and as fair. I saw one once, A sweet and gracious child, he smiled upon meâ Eleanor. He knew thee not. Rosamond. He smiled upon me, Queen, And in my heart I blest him. 'Twas thy Geoffrey. If e'er thou meet my children, think on him, And thou'lt not harm them. Not to be in truth King Henry's wife, could I have injured him. Eleanor. Peace! smooth and wily serpent! I came hither Not to hold parley, but to execute A needful justice on a desperate sinner. Rosamond. We are all sinners. Eleanor. Bring the cup. Drink that, Or bare thy bosom to the sword. Rosamond. 'Tis poison! Eleanor. Swift sudden poison. Drink! Rosamond. Not yet! Not yet! The sternest justice yields some little pause Betwixt the sentence and the death. Grant thou Some respite for dear charity. An hour! Only an hour! Eleanor. Drink, minion. Rosamond. I must die, I knew that when I saw thee; but unshriven, Without the rite of holy Church, or prayer Of pious priest! I ask thee not for life, Albeit life is precious, I but crave Such ghostly comfort as is given to thieves And murderers on the scaffold. Eleanor. Drain the bowlâ Or seize her, archers, and with your sharp swords Let out her life. Rosamond. Alas! for womanhood Yield me not up to these stern men! I'll drink The poison. Now farewell to hope, and joy, And love the latest passion. (She drinks the poison and a trumpet is heard without.) Eleanor. Hark! that trumpet! Rosamond. I know the soundâThe King! the King! Too late Thou com'st, my Henry. Eleanor. Aye! The bowl is drained. I am triumphantâLet King Henry come, My great revenge is sure, and for my fate I reck not. (Enter King Henry, and Guards.) Henry. Wherefore be the warders changed And Reginald Fitz-UrseâQueen Eleanor! I read the riddle nowâbut I am here To guard thee, Rosamond, and clear thy bower Of these stern visitants. Avoid the castle All ye of the Queen's train! Sir Hugh de Clinton, See that my bidding be obeyed, and line The courts with my stout yeomen. [Exeunt the Queen's guards. So! Fair Madam I prythee back to Windsor! I am loath To use a husband's powerâay or a king'sâ But tempt me not!âI know thee, Eleanor, And so far can endureâno farther. Back To Windsor, Queen! Yon gentle trembler sits Shivering like a new caged birdâDepart I warn thee, Madam! For as I'm a knight, As I'm a man, I cannot chuse but soothe The lovely wretch that suffers for my sin. Wilt thou not bid me welcome, sweet? nor thank The precious chance that brought me here to change Hatred and malice into love and joy? Rosamond. Joy! Henry. Did she speak? Her gladsome voice is changed; And that sweet word rang like a knell! Take comfort, My Rosamond. Rosamond. Comfort! But 'tis a comfort To see thee once again, once ere we part. Henry. Who hath dared speak of parting? Who could part Two hearts that loved like ours? Who dare to sever King Henry from his love? Eleanor. A mightier king, The mightiest of the mightyâDeath. Yon bowl Hath well avenged me. Henry. Poisoned! Fiend accurst, Full of all vice that woman ever knew, Wanton in youth, and jealous in thine age, And now a murderess, look to find a vengeance Stupendous as thy crimes! Rosamond. Henry! Henry. My Rose, My murdered Rose, how could I waste a thought On aught save thee! Go ransack all the land For costly antidotes, search all the earth For skilful leeches! Say, I'll give my crown To him that saves my Rosamond. My fairest, Thou shalt not die. Eleanor. The crowns of the whole earth Could not preserve her life an hour. The draught Was deadly. Thou wilt see her boasted charms A loathsome mass in thine embraces. Henry. Slay Yon fiend! She maddens me. Rosamond. Nay, touch her not. Forgive me, 'tis the first time I e'er crost A wish of thineâShe must not die. Henry. Had she A heart, those words would kill her.âOh my Rose, That I could die with thee! Rosamond. No! thou must live For England, for thy children. My poor boys! Could I have seen themâsend not, 'tis too late! A little space, and thy poor Rosamond Shall join her kindred clay. My boys! say to them That with her parting breath their mother blessedâ Oh no! no! no! I have no right to bless As virtuous mothers have. I am a curse To all my kindred, even to them who drew Their being from my crime. Let them forget Their mother's very name; and breed them humblyâ Promise me that, my Henry. Henry. Rosamond They shall be bred as Princes. Rosamond. Oh no! no! Humbly, most humbly. I was ne'er ambitious 'Midst all my sins. I loved thee for thyself Not for thy rank. 'Twas not the king I worshipped, But Henry, mine own Henry! Breed them humbly And say to William (for his mounting spirit Already fears me) that he take no vengeance For this rash deed. Henry. He shall not need. That task Is mine. Rosamond. That task is one forbid by Heaven. I do conjure thee, Henry, by the love Thou bear'st me, for the weal of thine own soulâ Eleanor. Go to, I fear him not. Henry. I thought to slay her, But that were mercy. She shall live.âWhy leave My circling arms, my Rosamond? Why drag Thy trembling form toward yonder murderess? Rosamond. Madam! Nay, stay me notâ'twill ease my heart. I am dying Untimely midst my sins, unshriven, unblest, By priest or bell, a sinner! yet one duty Even I may fill at this last hour, to part In charity. Eleanor. Dar'st thou to pardon me, Harlot, adulteress? Rosamond. Queen, for that foul sin I crave thy pardon! Oh forgive me, Madam, As I forgiveâ Henry. She sinks! Off with yon fiend, To prison! quick! off with her! (The guards take Eleanor away.) My beloved, How art thou? Rosamond. Easier. Henry. Oh she'll live! She'll live! No; no. Her cheeks grow whiter; and her hands Cold, cold; and scarce my trembling arms sustain Her sinking form. Rosamond. I'm easier. Henry. Is there aught That I can do to pleasure thee? My sweet one, Speak to me. Rosamond. My poor children! Henry. Are they not My children, Rosamond? Those boys will be My only comfort. I shall love them, dearest, Too fondly. Rosamond. And my father, my poor father! Henry. He shall be mine. Rosamond. I'm easier. Turn my face Toward the south. The sunshine from the oriel Lies straight upon the floor! 'Tis noon.âThe hour I longed for, and I've heard thy voice and felt The pressure of thy lip, aye and been clasped To that fond heart! We have been sinful, Henry, And therefore are we doomed; have loved too well, And thereforeâOh that this poor life of mine May expiate our crimes! that thou may'st be Happy and fortunate! Henry. Pray for thyself, Sweetest! What happiness is left for me When thou art gone? Think but of thee. Rosamond. I cannot If sin it be to love, that sin cleaves to meâ Henry! my king! I'm faint. Henry. She falls! she dies! Aye wet her temples with that essence.âRosamond! Is she gone, Constance? Is the spirit fled? My eyes are dizzy. One kiss more! Her breath Is gone; her lips are cold;âShe's dead, quite dead; And I am left alone and desolate. My Rosamond, my love!</field>
