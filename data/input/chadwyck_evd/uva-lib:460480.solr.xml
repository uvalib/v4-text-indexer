      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MR. CONNOR. Hail, holy friendship, generous attribute! Howe'er the frozen sceptic may dispute Thy unaffected power within the heart; Yet there, despite philosophy, thou art, There's thy dominion—witness the sublime, And beauteous story of the elder time.— Fitly, to night, all reverend with its age, The chronicle or Britain's manly stage, A fine reality, to-night for you, In such a theme, the Drama dares be true, And paints a pure and lofty sentiment, In an old tale's majestic precedent. Respect the theme, if not the Muse, nor here Indulge the critic's cold sardonic sneer; But to some faults, and we have many, blind; To any merits, if we have them, kind. And though we shrink before the sacred page Of the great poet of Eliza's age, When rose that mighty and gigantic band, Ere France's letters delug'd all the land— Of such surpassing excellence, that men, Despair to look upon their like again; Yet may some humbler spirit, though so high He ne'er may soar, like to the passing fly, Child of the summer, borrow from your smile A bright existence, and disport a while. But whatsoe'er our fate, who tries to raise An altar unto virtue has some praise. Husbands and fathers, here you stand secure, Our Muse, however uninspir'd, is pure. No fulsome blush, shall o'er the matron's cheek, Diffuse its hot, dishonourable streak, Nor the wise parent tremble, lest the child, Bear from the scene, his youthful heart defil'd, With the vile softness of that damned art, That, to enchant the fancy, soils the heart. A lofty pattern on the stage we show, Should make the soul of every Briton glow With all the force of friendship.—You should be Propitious to that fine fidelity— Men of the sea's first Island, tell me who Should prize the noble feelings more than you, By nature, and by freedom's habit wrought In all capacity of lofty thought! Then to pure friendship's glorious instance lend Your audience, and the sacred theme befriend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. —A Street in Syracuse. Dionysius and Procles discovered, as expecting tidings. Dion. Ere this the senate should have closed its councils, And chosen the new year's president. I pant To know their meeting's issue. Proc. Good my lord, There's but light doubt a great majority Of easy-purchas'd voices will be found For your fast friend, Philistius. Dion. On his choice Hangs the long chain of complicated purpose Has ta'en such time in linking. Plague upon The law, that from the senate-house excludes All soldiers, like ourselves, or we should soon Outvote all difficulty! (Senators cross the Stage). Ha! methinks The assembly hath dissolved. By Jupiter, Philistius' self doth hasten to us here, And with him Damocles! How now, my friend? Enter Philistius and Damocles. Art thou the president? Phil. I am, my lord. Chosen by a large majority to take The honourable office: in the which I may, at least, requite the benefits Which you have heaped upon me. Dam. Yes, my lord, We have at last attain'd the 'vantage ground, Whence your broad view may take a boundless prospect. Dion. 'Tis a bold step upon the mountain-path, Wherein I have long been toiling. I no longer Doubt of the senate's inclination. What say the soldiers? Thou hast hinted to them That we confided to thee? Proc. Yes, my lord; And they are ready for it. Dion. Go thou hence, And speak to them again; disperse more gold; 'Twill give a relish to thine eloquence; And, hark ye, lead them this way: I shall here Await thy coming. Ha! behold, in air, Where a majestic eagle floats above The northern turrets of the citadel; And, as the sun breaks through yon rifted cloud, His plumage shines, embath'd in burning gold, And sets off his regality in heaven. Thou knowest how readily the multitude Are won by such bright augury—make use Of divination,—haste thee. [Exit Procles. Philistius, give me your hand. I thank you: Things look in smiles upon me. It was otherwise But a year since, when I impeach'd the magistrates, For treasonable dealing with the foe, And the senate hurl'd me from my topmost height Of popularity. Dam. Degraded you From power, and office. Dion. Ay! at the appeal Of that stale pedant, the Pythagorean, Who hangs out his austerity for sale, In frowns, clos'd lips, and pithy sentences. Dam. Thou speakest of Damon? Dion. Ay, mine enemy, The patriot, and philosophic knave, Who hath been busy with my purposes,— And one day shall not smile at it. He came Into the senate-house, with a fierce crew Of his associates in philosophy, Silent and frowning, at his back; he rail'd And had his triumph.—Times have alter'd since; And to the mould and fashion of my will, Shall yet take stranger shape, when, Damocles, These long-trained lawgivers, these austere sages Shall find I can remember. Dam. Let them feel it. Dion. In all that biting bitterness of heart Which clings, and gnaws, by inches, to its object, More keen, because a first essay hath fail'd, In shame and suffering, failed, thus have I sped My work, in silence, on. It did become A thought in woven with my inmost being. Dam. The steps Which since most visibly you have ascended, Must have requir'd much effort? Dion. Yes! to have flung Into the shade of public disrepute The very men whose voices were most loud In working out my ruin;—after that, To gain the army's suffrage;—to be chosen Its head and general, that was another; To have won that very senate,— Phil. Yet pause, my lord,— Howe'er complying you have hitherto Found that assembly, and though most of them Are plung'd into your debt, beyond all means Of their redemption, yet may there be still Some sudden reluctation to the last, And mightiest of all hopes. Dion. The garrison Is not a bad ally methinks? Phil. The war Hath ta'en the flower of all the troops from Syracuse; And Damon heading the vile populace— Dion. I came from Agrigentum, to entreat Arms, corn, and money, from the senators, While I myself have purposely delay'd The granting them; meantime, the city is filled With many thousands of my followers. Phil. But, are they not unweapon'd? Dion. This city of Syracuse,— It hath a citadel? Phil. True, sir,—it hath. Dion. And therein, as I deem, its national stock Of corn, and arms, and gold, is treasur'd? Phil. True. Dion. The citadel is not impregnable; And when it is mann'd, and order'd to my will, What of these frothy speech-makers? [A shout is heard abroad. Phil. My lord, The soldiers shout for you. Dion. Procles, I see, Is at his work.—Good Damocles, Philistius, As you are senators, retire ye hence; It were not meet that you should look to have been Parties to any act, which afterwards May grow into discussion.—And, Philistius, One effort more among our city friends;— I will forewarn thee of the time to call The senators together—Yet, I mean not Exclusively to trust them, good Philistius;— Sure means sure ends.—I'll have a friend or two Within my call, to help them.—If their councils Become too knotty for unravelling, A sharp sword may be useful.—Fare you well. [Exeunt Philistius and Damocles. Voices (Without.) Ay, to the citadel—The citadel. Enter Procles and Soldiers. Dion. Who talks of moving to the citadel? 1st Soldier. It is himself,—huzza! All. Huzza! our general! Dion. Good friends, I thank ye. Procles art thou here? Hast thou distributed to these much-wrong'd men, The trifling bounty which I charg'd thee with? Proc. They have it, noble general. Dion. My friends, 'Twas a poor offering, and beneath your taking; But, as yourselves do know, my private purse Is light as that of any other veteran, Within the walls of Syracuse. Speak, Procles, Who talks of moving on the citadel? All. We, Dionysius, we. Proc. Yes, these brave spirits. Indignant at the senate's heedlessness Of you, and them, and of the general honour.— 1st Soldier. Ay, we will spurn their yoke, and have no master But our most noble general Dionysius! Dion. Give me not cause, my friends, to deem myself Dishonour'd and endanger'd in your love; For, as I am a soldier and a man, Could I believe that any other thought Engag'd you to possess the citadel, Save your anxiety for the soldier's weal, And the state's safety, I would raise my hand, In supplication, 'gainst your enterprise;— But, as the time now urges, and cries out For sudden muster, and organization Of the brave thousands, who but wait for swords, To join your ranks, and rush with you to glory,— And yet the senate,— Proc. Speak not of the senate: We do renounce its service and despise it. Dion. It was my thought to say, if they object, We may submit it, as a needful step, Claiming allowance in the exigency Of the occasion. Proc. They shall not control it. We seek not for their judgment of our act. All. On, general, on! Dion. When did ye call, That I replied not with my word and deed, My heart and hand? Even as you say it, on, On, fellow-soldiers, to the citadel! And let your swords be out, more in the show Of what ye are, soldiers and fighting-men, Than with a harmful purpose. Let us on! All. On to the citadel! the citadel! [Exeunt, with cries, and brandishing their swords. Scene II. —Another Street. Enter Damon. Damon. Philistius, then, is president at last, And Dionysius has o'er sway'd it? Well, It is what I expected: There is now No public virtue left in Syracuse. What should be hop'd from a degenerate, Corrupted, and voluptuous populace, If highly-born, and meanly-minded nobles Would barter freedom for a great man's feast, And sell their country for a smile? The stream, With a more sure eternal tendency Seeks not the ocean, than a sensual race Their own devouring slavery. I am sick, At my inmost heart, of every thing I see, And hear! O, Syracuse, I am, at last, Forc'd to despair of thee! And yet thou art My land of birth,—thou art my country still, And, like an unkind mother, thou hast left The claims of holiest nature in my heart, And I must sorrow for, not hate thee! (Shouts) Ha! What shouts are these? 'Tis from the citadel The uproar is descending. Enter Lucullus. Speak, Lucullus, What has befallen? Luc. Have you not heard the news? Damon. What news? Luc. As through the streets I pass'd, the people Said that the citadel was in the hands Of Dionysius. Damon. The citadel In Dionysius' hands? What dost thou tell me? How,—wherefore,—when? In Dionysius' hands? The traitor Dionysius?—Speak, Lucullus, And quickly. Luc. It was said, that by rude force, Heading a troop of soldiers, he had ta'en Possession of the citadel, and seized The arms and treasure in't. [Exit. Damon. I am thunder stricken! The citadel assaulted, and the armory In that fierce soldier's power! (Shouts) Again! By all The gods on high Olympus, I behold His standard waving o'er it,—and they come, His most notorious satellites, high heap'd With arms and plunder! Parricidal slaves, What have ye done? Enter Procles and Soldiers. Soldiers. For Dionysius! Ho! For Dionysius! Damon. Silence! obstreperous traitors! Your throats offend the quiet of the city; And thou, who standest foremost of these knaves, Stand back, and answer me,—a senator. What have you done? Proc. But that I know 'twill gall thee, Thou poor, and talking pedant of the school Of dull Pythagoras, I'd let thee make Conjecture from thy senses: But, in hope 'Twill stir your solemn anger, learn from me, We have ta'en possession of the citadel, And— Damon. Patience, ye good gods! a moment's patience, That these too ready hands may not enforce The desperate precept of my rising heart— Thou most contemptible, and meanest tool That ever tyrant used!— Proc. Do you hear him, soldiers? First, for thy coward railings at myself And since thou hast called our Dionysius tyrant, Here, in the open streets of Syracuse, I brand thee for a liar, and a traitor! Damon. Audacious slave! Proc. Upon him, soldiers,— Hew him to pieces! Soldiers. On him! (With a shout.) Enter Pythias, as they rush upon Damon. Pyth. Back on your lives! Cowards, damn'd, treacherous cowards, back I say! Do you know me? Look upon me: Do you know This honest sword I brandish? You have seen it Among the ranks of Carthage; would you now Taste its shrewd coldness in your quaking selves! Back! back! I say. He hath his armour on.— I am his sword, shield, helm; I but enclose Myself, and my own heart, and heart's blood, when I thus stand before him. Damon. False-hearted cravens! We are but two—my Pythias, my halved heart!— My Pythias, and myself; but dare come on. Ye hirelings of a tyrant! dare advance A foot, or raise an arm, or bend a brow, And ye shall learn what two such arms can do Amongst a thousand of ye.—My good friend, The gods have sent thee to me—Who had deem'd To find thee here from Agrigentum? [Soldiers advance. Pyth. Off! Off, villains, off!—Each for the other thus, And in that other, for his dearer self. Why, Procles, art thou not asham'd,—for I Have seen thee do good work in battle time— Art not asham'd, here on a single man To rush in coward numbers? Fie upon thee! I took thee for a soldier. Proc. For thy sake, Who art a warrior like ourselves, we spare him— 'Twas a good star of his that led thee hither, From Agrigentum, to lift up thine arm In the defence of that long robe of peace Wherein he wraps his stern philosophy. Come, teach him better manners. Soldiers, on,— Let us to Dionysius. [Exeunt Procles and Soldiers. Pyth. Art thou safe From these infuriate stabbers? Damon. Thanks to thee, I am safe, my gallant soldier, and fast friend: My better genius sent thee to my side, When I did think thee far from Syracuse. Pyth. I have won leave to spend some interval From the fierce war, and come to Syracuse, With purpose to espouse the fair Calanthe.— The gods have led me hither, since I come In time to rescue thee. How grew this rude broil up? Damon. Things go on here Most execrably, Pythias. But you are come To be a husband, are you not? Pyth. To-morrow I call my soft Calanthe wife. Damon. Then, Pythias, I will not shade the prospect of your joys With any griefs of mine. I cry you mercy— These are experiments too over nice For one that has a mistress, and would wed her With an uncut throat. I have oft wish'd myself, That to the blest retreats of private life My lot had been awarded;—every hour Makes one more sick and weary with the sense Of this same hopeless service of a state, Where there is not enough of virtue left To feed the gleamings of our liberty.— But, my soldier, I will not make thee a participant In my most sad forebodings. Pythias, I say, 'twere better be the Persian's slave, And let him tread upon thee, when he would Ascend his horse's back, than—yet, not so, I am too much gall'd and fretted to pronounce A sober judgment, and the very mask Of freedom, is yet better than the bold, Uncover'd front of tyranny.—Farewell! Pyth. Nay, I must follow thee, and find the cause That so perturbs thy spirit. Damon. How, sir! You have A mistress here in Syracuse, and, look, Herself comes forth to meet you. Pyth. Where! Calanthe! Nay, I behold her not—you mock me, Damon. Damon. (Pointing to a different side of the stage.) Look this way, sir. Pyth. It is herself, indeed, My own, my fond, betrothed one. Enter Calanthe. Cal. My dear, But most neglecting Pythias! Pyth. By the birth Of Venus, when she rose out of the sea, And with her smile did fill the Grecian isles With everlasting verdure, she was not, Fresh from the soft creation of the wave, More beautiful than thee! Cal. Thou fondly thinkest To hide thy false oblivion of the maid, That, with a panting heart awaited thee. Now, Pythias, I do take it most unkind, That thou to friendship hast made sacrifice Of the first moment of thy coming here. Pyth. Nay, chide me not; for I was speeding to thee. Cal. Soon as I heard thou wert in Syracuse, I ran at once to hail thee with a smile, Although my mother would have staid me. (Pythias kisses her hand.) Damon. (who is lost in thought.) Yes, They must at least be safe. Pyth. And how, Calanthe, Fares thy dear mother? Cal. Happy in the thought If she must needs (as she must) part with me, It is at least to thee. Pyth. And my poor father? Cal. Time has almost shut up his faculties, And he can scarce distinguish any voice That is address'd to him. The day is pass'd, Upon his couch; at evening, in a chair, He is carried to the terrace-walk before The threshold of his mansion, where the wind, Fresh from the sea, plays with his locks of grey, Till pleas'd at last he smiles. That gentle smile, As 'tis the first denotement of a thought In speechless infancy, 'tis the last sign Of the expiring mind. Pyth. My soft Calanthe Must be a tender on infirmity, Before her time. But where's my silent friend? Why, Damon, what's the matter? Damon. (Aside, and still lost in thought.) One brave blow, And it were done! By all the gods, one blow, And Syracuse were free!—Pythias, is't you?— I cry you mercy, (to Cal.) fair one—Pythias, You are to be married. Haste thee, Pythias,— Love, and fight on. Thine arm to Mars, thy heart Give to his paramour.—Take thou no care Of the politician's study—'twill turn pale Thy face, make thee grow sick at nature's loveliness, And find in her pure beauty but one blank Of dismal, colourless, sterility. Calanthe, look to it—let him not play The statesman's sorry part. Pyth. Damon, you let The commonwealth o'erfret you. I was about To pray you to our wedding. Damon. I intended, Unbidden, to be there. Pyth. From friendship's eyes I'll win addition to my happiness. Calanthe, come—I should be half in fear, To seem thus loving of thee, in the sight Of this philosopher. Cal. Nay, he pretends To be by half more rugged, and more wise, Than he hath any right to: I have seen him, (Have I not, Damon?) looking at his wife, When he imagin'd none was there to mark The proud Pythagorean, with an eye Filled with tenderness:—and his young boy, too, That seems Aurora's child, with his fine face, Stirr'd his stern visage to complacency. Come, come, we'll be reveng'd upon you both: I swear, his wife and I will be accounted Your rivals in the godlike quality Your lordly sex would arrogate its own Peculiar privilege, and show the world The unseen, and yet unrumour'd prodigy,— The friendship of a woman. [Exeunt Pythias and Calanthe. Damon. Hark thee, Lucullus.— My wife and child must instantly depart From Syracuse;—you must attend them hence, Unto my villa, on the mountain side. Luc. Alas, my lord! Damon. Why dost thou droop? Luc. My lord, I was your slave; you gave me liberty; And when I see you peril'd— Damon. Nay, Lucullus, Where is the warrant for thy fear? Luc. I read You are engag'd in some dread enterprise, Else you would not deny them to your sight: You fear the leaning ruin may fall down, Upon their dearer heads. Damon. I charge you, sir, No prying in my purposes.—Take care You speak not to my wife of any thing May stir her apprehensions—see, she comes— Beware thy looks betray thee. Enter Hermion. Herm. Art thou safe, Damon, art safe? Damon. You are not a widow yet, Herm. For shame to talk of such a thing. I have heard Of thy rude quarrelling with that same fierce, And overbearing soldier. But thou art safe.— Proud men? how reckless of the faithful hearts That doat on you,—that hang their weakness on ye! How reckless of us in your bustling hours Of occupation and despatch, ye are! Ah, then you think not of the pining mate, Left in her solitude, with nought to do, But weep for your return, and chide the gods, That make your minds so stern and enterprising. Damon. Hermion, I think the city's fulsome air Likes not our boy:—The colour in his cheek Hath lost its rich and healthful purity. Herm. Nay, you are wrong there;—'tis like a young peach, Or yet more fresh and blooming. Damon. Hermion, I have resolv'd that you and he shall go Unto my villa, near to Syracuse. Herm. But you will come with us? Damon. Hermion, you know My occupation forbids that wish. Luc. My lord— Damon. Forbear sir—yet I cannot go,— I mean, I cannot go immediately— The state affairs lay hold upon me. You Must hence before me thither. Herm. Damon— Damon. Come, Look not thus sadly. Herm. I have learn'd too well The usage of obedience, to inquire Into your purposes. Damon. Hermion, I'll take Occasion oft to visit you—to-morrow— If possible, to-morrow, Herm. Will you so? Nay, will you truly promise it? Damon. I do.— Hermion, you must be sudden—you must despatch.— Come—but I'll see my boy before you go.— Hermion, he is our only one.—That child Is made of thy own heart, and mine—I charge thee, Have thou a care, in all vicissitudes Of private or of public incident, To form in him, what will out-top the height Of the best laurel-tree in all the groves Of the Academy,—an honest man.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. —A Chamber in Arria's House. Enter Pythias and Calanthe. Pyth. So, my Calanthe, you would waste the moon Of Hymen in this lonely spot? Cal. In sooth I would, for 'tis the fairest place in Sicily: A dell, made of green beauty; with its shrubs Of aromatic sweetness, growing up The rugged mountain's sides, as cunningly As the nice structure of a little nest, Built by two loving nightingales. The wind, That comes there, full of rudeness from the sea, Is lull'd into a balmy breath of peace, The moment that it enters; and 'tis said By our Sicilian shepherds, that their songs Have in this place a wilder melody. The mountains all about it are the haunts Of many a fine romantic memory! High towers old Ætna, with his feet deep clad In the green sandals of the freshful spring; His sides array'd in winter, and his front Shooting aloft the everlasting flame. On the right hand is that great cave, in which Huge Polyphemus dwelt, between whose vast Colossal limbs the artful Grecian stole. On the other side, Is Galatea's dainty dressing-room, Wrought in the living marble; and within Is seen the fountain where she us'd to twine The ringlets on her neck that did ensnare The melancholy Cyclop.—But what care you, A soldier, for such fantasies? I know A way that better shall persuade you to That place for our sweet marriage residence— There Damon hath his villa—Ha! you seem Determin'd by the fast proximity Of such a friendship, more than all my love. Pyth. Does Damon dwell there? Cal. No; his Hermion And his young boy—O! 'tis a beauteous child!— Are sent there from the city's noxious air, And he doth visit them, whene'er the state Gives him brief respite. Tell me, Pythias, Shall we not see the Hymeneal moon Glide through the blue heavens there? Pyth. My own ador'd one, If thou should'st bid me sail away with thee, To seek the isles of the Hesperides, I would, with such a pilot, spread my sail Beyond the trophies of great Hercules, Making thine eyes my Cynosure! Enter Lucullus. How now, Lucullus? Luc. Where is my lord? I was inform'd That I should find him here—a senator Bade me require him instantly. Pyth. He waits here, To attend us to the temple, and if things Of weight demand his ear, you'll find him yonder In the pale cypress-grove. [Exit Lucullus. Nothing I hope Has happen'd to withdraw him from the rite That makes thee mine. Cal. I hope not.—Who is this That seeks him out so earnestly? Pyth. He is A brave Italian, whom the Carthage pirates Seiz'd on his native coast, and sold a slave. Damon hath given him back his liberty, But yet, of his free will, he tends him still: And more than very freedom doth he hold The right to serve a man that is fine touch'd With a most merciful spirit. Cal. Nay, my Pythias, Make not your friend's high qualities for aye The burthen of your eloquence—In sooth, I should be almost jealous of a steed I saw you pat with a too liberal hand; And—ha! he comes. Enter Damon. Damon. Pythias—(aside) I must not let Calanthe read my purpose. Calanthe, The blessing, and the bounty of the gods Be with you, over you, and all around you, Thou gentle girl!—Pythias, a word with you. (Aside to Pyth.) What heard I, think you, Pythias, even now? Cal. There has been Pythias, all this forenoon, Would speak to me of nothing but the esteem In which he held thee, Damon. Damon. What! no word Touching the quality of that foolish love He bears the fair Calanthe? (To Pyth. aside.) We are undone, We, and our wretched city, Pythias! Pyth. (Aside to Damon.) What dost thou mean? Cal. No, not a single word— Thou, thou alone mad'st up his eulogy. Damon. What think'st thou, Pythias? A king? (Aside.) Pyth. (Aside to Damon.) What! who? Damon. (To Cal.) Heed not His silken praises of me.—(To Pyth. aside.) Dionysius Is to be crowned in the senate-house. Pyth. Can it be possible? Damon. I say thee, yea— His soldiers line the streets. Pyth. But will the senate, The coward senate sanction it? Will none Oppose him in it? Damon. Oppose him!—(Aloud.) all the gods So help, or strike me, as I will oppose him! Let Etna vomit fire upon his side, And I alone—Ha! I forgot my dagger. [Searching about him. Cal. How now, my Pythias? Pyth. He is mov'd, Calanthe, By some most urgent matter of the state; Nay, heed him not! Damon. Pythias, as I intended To be a witness to thy wedding-rite, I did not bear a weapon—give me thy poniard. Pyth. Speak, to what end? Damon. No matter, give it me. Cal. Ha! what does he intend? Now, by my love Pythias, I do adjure thee,— Pyth. Whither, Damon, Where would'st thou go? Damon. Unto the senate-house. Pyth. Then I will with you, too. Cal. He shall not! Damon. No! Thou say'st aright,—he shall not! Fair Calanthe, This is no hour to leave thee! What, Calanthe, Should bridegrooms give the law, and 'gin to rule Even on their wedding-day? I charge thee, sweet, Assert thy brief dominion, while thou canst: 'Twill speedily be his turn. (Aside to Pyth.) It shall not be! It is against the law For any soldier in the senate-house To lift his helm of war, and what avail Were thy companionship? Calanthe, take him, Take him away, and heaven be o'er you both! Pyth. But thou wilt promise me, upon the faith Of an old friendship, that thy sudden hand Will not attempt a rashness? Damon. Be thou satisfied, I will do nought in passion. Come, Calanthe, (Aside.) Assert thy right in him, and bear him hence Unto the garden-walk, and tell him o'er The names of all thy favourite plants; I pray thee, Keep him in busy trifles, till the hour For the sweet rite be come—That's well, my girl— There, take him by the arm! Cal. Come, Pythias, come! I thank thee, Damon, for thy tender counsel. Pyth. Nay, Damon, nay, Calanthe— Cal. Nay me no nays; I say it shall be so. Damon. May the gods pour Their blessing o'er your heads!—Farewell! farewell! I have no time to bide here, but my heart Shall be beside you at the altar-place. Perhaps it is an idle fear compels me Hence from your sight—I will, if possible Return and see you wedded.—Fare you well! Now, Syracuse, for thee!—And may the fates So bless, or curse me, as I act in this! [Exeunt severally. Scene II. —The Senate-house of Syracuse.—Senators assembled.—Philistius at their head—Dionysius stands in the front of the Stage—Damocles. 1st Sen. So soon warn'd back again! Dion. So soon, good fathers. My last despatches here set forth, that scarce I had amass'd and form'd our gallant legions, When, as by magic, word of the precaution Was spirited to their camp—and on the word, These Carthagenians took their second thought, And so fell back. Phil. I do submit to you, That out of this so happy consequence Of Dionysius' movement on the citadel, Not only is his pardon for the act Freely drawn forth, but we are call'd upon Our thanks most manifestly to express For such a noble service. Dion. Good Philistius, I am a soldier; yours and the state's servant, And claim no notice for my duty done Beyond the doing it—and the best thanks I merit, or can have, lie in the issue Which has most happily resulted. Dam. Nay, It rests in us to say so. Phil. Dionysius, The work which of this enterprise thou hast made, Proves that our citadel, and its resources, Have been misus'd; and never so controll'd And order'd for our good, as by thyself;— Therefore retain it, govern and direct it.— Would the whole state were like the citadel! In hot and angry times like these we want Even such a man. Dam. I, from my heart, assent to And second this proposal. Dion. Most reverend fathers— Dam. We pray thee silence, noble Dionysius! All here do know what your great modesty Will urge you to submit—but I will raise This envious veil wherein you shroud yourself. It is the time to speak; our country's danger Calls loudly for some measure at our hands, Prompt and decisive. Damon (Without.) Thou most lowly minion! I'll have thee whipp'd for it, and by the head Made less even than thou art! Enter Damon. Phil. Who breaks so rude and clamorously in To scare our grave deliberations? Damon. A senator!—First let me ask you why Upon my way here to sit down with you I have encounter'd in the open streets, Nay, at the very threshold of your doors, Soldiers and satellites array'd and marshall'd With their swords out? Why have I been obstructed By an armed bandit in my peaceful walk here, To take my rightful seat in the senate-house? Why has a ruffian soldier privilege To hold his weapon to my throat? A tainted, Disgrac'd, and abject traitor, Procles? Who Dar'd place the soldiers round the senate-house? Phil. I pray you, fathers, let not this rash man Disturb the grave and full consideration Of the important matter touching which We spoke ere he rushed in. Dam. I did require To know from you, without a hand or head, Such as to us hath been our Dionysius, What now were our most likely fate? Damon. The fate Of freemen in the full; free exercise Of all the noble rights that freemen love! Free in our streets to walk; free in our councils To speak and act— Phil. I do entreat you, senators, Protect me from this scolding demagogue, And let us win your— Damon. Demagoguge, Philistius! Who was the demagogue, when at my challenge He was denounc'd and silenc'd by the senate, And your scant oratory spent itself In fume and vapour? Dam. Silence, Damon, silence! And let the council use its privilege. Damon. Who bids me silence? Damocles, the soft And pliant willow, Damocles!—But come, What do you dare propose? Come, I'll be silent— Go on. Phil. Resolve you then, is Dionysius This head indeed to us? Acting for us— Yea, governing, that long have proved we cannot Although we feign it, govern for ourselves? Dam. Then who so fit, in such extremity, To be the single pillar, on whose strength All power should rest? Phil. Ay, and what needs the state Our crowded and contentious councils here? And therefore, senators,—countrymen, rather, That we may be wiser, and better rul'd Than by ourselves we are; that the state's danger May be confronted boldly, and that he May have but his just meed, I do submit That forthwith we dissolve ourselves, and chuse A king in Dionysius. Damon, King! A king? 1st Sen. I do approve it. 2d. Sen. Ay, and I. Dam. And all! Damon. And all! are all content? A nation's rights betray'd, And all content! O slaves! O parricides! O, by the brightest hope a just man has, I blush to look around and call you men! What! with your own free willing hands yield up The ancient fabric of your constitution, To be a garrison, a common barrack, A common guard-house, and for common cut-throats! What! will ye all combine to tie a stone Each to each other's necks, and drown like dogs Within the tide of time, and never float To after ages, or at best, but float A buoyant pestilence? Can ye but dig Your own dark graves, creep into them, and die? 3d. Sen. I have not sanction'd it. 4th. Sen. Nor I. 5th. Sen. Nor I. Damon. O! thanks for these few voices! but alas! How lonely do they sound! Do you not all Start up at once, and cry out liberty! Are you so bound in fetters of the mind, That there you sit as if you were yourselves Incorporate with the marble? Syracusans!— But, no! I will not rail, nor chide, nor curse ye! I will implore you, fellow-countrymen, With blinded eyes, and weak and broken speech, I will implore you—O! I am weak in words, But I could bring such advocates before you;— Your father's sacred images; old men That have been grandsires; women with their children, Caught up in fear and hurry, in their arms— And those old men should lift their shivering voices, And palsied hands—and those affrighted mothers Should hold their innocent infants forth, and ask, Could you make slaves of them? Phil. I dissolve the senate At its own vote and instance. (Leaves his seat.) Dam. And all hail! Hail, Dionysius, King of Syracuse! Dion, Is this the vote? Damon. There is no vote! Philistius Hold you your seat; keep in your places, senators. Dion. I ask, is this the vote? Phil. It is the vote, My gracious liege and sovereign! Damon. I say nay! You have not voted, Naxillus, nor Petus— Nor you, nor you, nor you. Phil. In my capacity As head, and organ of the city council, I do asseverate it is the vote! (They all kneel to Dionysius except Damon. Dion. I thank you, friends, and countrymen, I thank ye! Damon. O, all the gods, my country, O, my country! Dion. And that we may have leisure to put on With fitting dignity our garb of power, We do now, first assuming our own right, Command from this, that was the senate-house, Those rash, tumultuous men, who still would tempt The city's peace with wild vociferation, And vain contentious rivalry. Begone! Damon. I stand A senator within the senate-house. Dion. Traitor! and dost thou dare me to my face? Damon. Traitor! to whom? to thee!—O! Syracuse, Is this thy register'd doom? To have no meaning For the proud names of liberty and virtue, But as some regal braggart sets it down In his vocabulary? And the sense, The broad bright sense that Nature hath assign'd them In her infallible volume, interdicted For ever from thy knowledge; or if seen, And known, and put in use, denounc'd as treasonable, And treated thus?—No, Dionysius, no! I am no traitor! But in mine allegiance To my lost country, I proclaim thee one! Dion. My guards there! Ho! Damon. What! hast thou then invok'd Thy satellites already? Enter Procles and Soldiers. Dion. Seize him! (Damon rushes on Dionysius, and attempts to stab him.) Damon. First, Receive a freeman's legacy!—He is intercepted by Procles.)—Dionysius, Thy genius is triumphant, and old Syracuse Bows her to the dust at last!—'Tis done; 'tis o'er, And we are slaves for ever! Dion. We reserve This proud assassinating demagogue, Who whets his dagger on philosophy, For—an example to his cut-throat school! The axe, and not the sword. Out of his blood We'll mix a cement to our monarchy— Here do we doom him to a public death! Damon. Death's the best gift to one that never yet Wish'd to survive his country. Here are men Fit for the life a tyrant can bestow! Let such as these live on. Dion. Hold thou there! Lest having stirr'd our vengeance into wrath, It reach unto those dearer than thyself. Ha! have I touch'd thee, Damon? Is there a way To level thee unto the feebleness Of universal nature? What, no word? Come, use thy time, my brave philosopher! Soon will thy tongue cleave an unmoving lump Of thickest silence and oblivion, And that same wide and sweeping hand of thine, Us'd to the orator's high attitude, Lie at thy side in inutility. Thou hast few moments left! Damon. I know thee well— Thou art wont to use thy tortures on the heart, Watching it's agonizing throbs, and making A science of that fell anatomy! These are thy bloody metaphysics—this Thy barbarous philosophy! I own Thou hast struck thy venom'd sting into my soul, But while I am wounded, I despise thee still! My wife! my child!—O, Dionysius, Thou should'st have spar'd me that!—Procles, lead on. [Exeunt. Scene III. —A Chamber in Arria's House. Enter Pythias. Pyth. What shouts rend the wide city? There is a roar Deep as the murmuring of Etna. Gods! I tremble for his safety. What, hoa, there! Enter a Servant. Hast thou, sirrah, Heard no intelligence how matters speed Up at the senate-house? Ser. My lord, no word. Pyth. And those time-cheating knaves I sent to know,— They have not yet returned? Ser. Not yet, my lord. Pyth. Run thither, then—for thou art light-limb'd,— Regard Lord Damon well; note how he seems, And what he says—On, on. Ser. My lord, I will. Pyth. And, hark! Observe of all if any words of wrath Fall between him and Dionysius— Begone! [Exit Servant. Pyth. He is hotly mettled, And not life's autumn, nor the discipline Of cold Pythagoras' school has tam'd it yet. Enter a Servant. Ser. My lord,— Pyth. Now, sir, what from the senate-house? Ser. My lord, I know not of the senate-house. Pyth. Not, sir! I sent thee thither, did I not? Ser. Another, sir. I am despatch'd to say, That all the guests and witnesses are come, And that with them the bride Calanthe waits To have thy company to the temple. Pyth. How! Is it the hour? Ser. The hour, my lord, is past. [Exit Servant. Pyth. Did ever man upon his wedding-day Feel so impatient of the hour arriv'd That is to bless him? But I dare not stir Till I have tidings of my friend—He is Expos'd to deadly loss, and may have need Of Pythias' sword. By Heaven, I do him wrong In tarrying from his presence at an hour So full of peril, and perhaps of death. Death, did I say? I must— Enter Arria. Arria, Now, Pythias, Pythias, Why is it that we wait so long for thee? Fie! thou a bridegroom! absent now! Pyth. Gods! If that Dionysius Should level at his life!—I pr'ythee, Arria, How soon might one with active and light foot Run to the senate-house, and back again, From hence? Arria. Is the man craz'd and lunatic? Is it your pleasure that we wait a season, I, sir, Calanthe, and our guests and kinsmen, For your best humour to get wedded in? Pyth. Good Arria, pardon me; take not amiss This absent seeming—but I am not well, I know not how, but so you see it is— Give me an half-hour—nay, the half—the tithe Of such a time! Arria. Pythias, indeed art ill? Pyth. 'I faith, I am—sick in the head and heart! Bear with me, Arria; go among our guests, And cheat their notice of this accident, I shall be better quickly—Well, quite well. Arria. The gods forefend it should fall otherwise. [Exit Arria. Pyth. O how these leaden-footed limping minutes Lag and creep beneath my lashing wish! When fiery expectation mounts the time, Time is a spiritless and jaded steed, That staggers 'neath his rider. Gracious gods! Will none of them come to relieve this weight From my o'erloaded heart!—What shall I do? Calanthe! Enter Calanthe. Cal. My dear Pythias! Pyth. Calanthe! Cal. My mother whisper'd me you were not well; And here, even as you see me, though you should not Have seen me in my bridal garments thus Till we were wedded—yet even thus, To speak with you, and comfort you, I came. Pyth. Beshrew her heart now, though she be thy mother, For such ill-tim'd and womanish whispering. I am as well, as I am happy too. Cal. She said, too, but I heed it not— Pyth. What said she? Cal. She pray'd the gods your sickness might be free From surfeit sickness: but, I heed it not: You know I heed it not; I cannot think Your heart is such a bad one, Pythias. Pyth. How! Cal. I do not think 'tis in your very nature To stumble so—at least, I do not think You would have waited till this very hour, When, like two plants that have been long in neighbourhood, Our souls had crept and twin'd around each other, Leaves, fibres, roots, and all! Pyth. Tears, my Calanthe! How like a virgin morn in May thou art, That would be wedded to the amorous day, In all it's watery freshness! My fair girl, The maiden pulse beating upon thy brow Is not so faithful to its sister pulse, Which throbs within this little heart of thine, As I have been, and am!—Ha! dost thou smile? Now, by the gods! I cannot see thee smile, And tarry longer from the property Of this dear hand I grasp. Come, my Calanthe, They tarry for us, do they not? Cal. They do. Pyth. Nay, do not bend thy head, but let me gaze Upon thee as we go, that those fine looks, So full of life and joy, may banish from me The ghastly thought of death! Cal. Death! Pyth. Nay, forgive me; I know not what I say.—Ye bounteous gods, Who guard the good, because yourselves are good, Wave your protecting arm around him!—Come,— O, Friendship! thou must yield it for a time, To the torch-bearer, when he lights his fires From two such eyes as these are!—Come, Calanthe. [Exeunt. Scene IV. —A Dungeon. Damon discovered at a table, writing. Damon. Existence! what is that? a name for nothing! It is a cloudy sky chas'd by the winds; Its fickle form no sooner chosen than chang'd; It is the whirling of the mountain-flood, Which, as we look upon it, keeps its shape, Though what compos'd that shape, and what composes, Hath pass'd—will pass—nay, and is passing on, Even while we think to hold it in our eyes, And deem it there. Fie! fie! a feverish vision, A crude and crowded dream, unwill'd, unbidden, By the weak wretch that dreams it. Enter Procles and Guards. Proc. Damon, thine hour is come. Damon. Past, sir, say past—to come, argues a stay Upon the coming. He has refus'd me then— Your general, Dionysius!—the king— He has refus'd me even this little respite I ask'd of him? Proc. All! he refuses all. Damon. Did'st tell him why I ask'd it? Did'st explain It was to have my wife warn'd here to Syracuse, From her near dwelling upon Ætna's side, To see me ere I die? Proc. I said it, sir. Damon. And he refus'd it? Proc. Ay, sir; he refus'd. Damon. Upon the instant? Proc. Yes, upon the instant. Damon. Is he not wedded? Proc. Yes. Damon. A father, too? Proc. He is a father, too. Damon. And he refus'd it! I will attend you, and I pray you pardon— This is no time to play the catechist— The little boon I have to beg of thee, It is the last; I would not fain be irksome; It is the last I shall prefer on earth Unto my fellow-men.—This is my testament— I pray thee give it to a friend of mine Who may inquire about me; he will hold it And use it for my wife. Proc. His name? Damon. It is— I did not wish to trust my coward tongue With utterance of that name; I fear'd it would Pluck up all manhood by the roots; but, sir, This now is childish; Pythias, sir—Alas! To-day will prove a woful wedding-day To thee, and thy Calanthe!—and my Hermion, My fond, poor Hermion, and my boy—Good Procles, Let me not stand here talking idly thus— I am quite ready—on, sir; I attend you!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. —A Temple of Hymen. Pythias and Calanthe discovered with Arria, Guests, Priests, and Virgins—Pythias holding Calanthe's hand. Hymn. 1st. Priest and 1st. Virgin. Thou beneath whose holy smile Lips may meet, and not defile, And hands and hearts together cling, Fearless of shame and sorrowing: The vows we offer, Hymen, hear; Record the oath thy votaries swear; Bless the hands that now are plight, And sanctify the nuptial rite! Chorus. Bless the hands that now are plight, And sanctify the nuptial rite! 1st. Priest. Thou, who turn'st to holy fire The sinful blaze of young desire. 1st. Virgin. Thou, whose hand-maid virtues deck The bridal flowers for beauty's neck, That the fond maid as blest may be, And meet his wooing modestly. Chorus. Bless the hands that now are plight, And sanctify the nuptial rite! At the beginning of this Chorus, Pythias and Calanthe kneel; at the close of it, Lucullus enters, and runs up to Pythias, and whispers him; Pythias lets drop Calanthe's hand, and starts up. Pyth. Hold! hush your songs of Hymen, for I hear A raven's croaking, that discordantly Breaks in upon your joyous melody! (To Luc.) Where, sirrah, where? Where shall I speak with him? Luc. He did desire, my lord, that I should lead you. Pyth. And not say where? Luc. It was his charge, my lord. Pyth. In one word, say the hour and place of this, Or—ha! I see it in thine eye—his life, His life is forfeit—he is doom'd to death! Luc. Alas! my lord. Pyth. O, by the gods, it is so! And like a selfish coward did I stand, And saw him rush and singly front himself Against a host, when it was evident, As is the universal light of day, He must have perish'd in't—Coward! coward! He would not thus have done! Luc. My lord,— Pyth. Speak not. I know thou would'st admonish me to speed, Or see him dead. Cal. Pythias! Arria. Where would'st thou go? Would you yet more insult us? Cal. Pythias! Pyth. Now let me go—away, I say! Cal. Pythias! Pyth. I say unloose me, or, by all— Thou art as guilty, with thy blandishments, That did provoke this ruin, as I am For being tempted by thee!—Woman, away! Cal. Unkind one! Pyth. Ha! thou weepest!—O, Calanthe! Forgive me—pity me—I am desperate! I know not what I do—but—(Embraces her.)—O Calanthe, There is a horrid fate that tears me hence. Now, sirrah, lead me on!—Away! away! (Rushes out with Lucullus. [Scene closes on the rest. Scene II. —A Street. Enter Damon, guarded, and Procles. Damon. A moment's pause here, Procles. We discours'd together Of an old friend of mine, who in all likelihood Would question thee concerning my last thoughts, While leaving this vain world; I do entreat thee, When thou shalt see that man, commend me to him, And say, a certainty of how true a friend And father he will be unto my wife, And child— Pyth. (Without) Hold back! it is impossible That ye butcher him, till we speak together! Enter Pythias, preceded by Soldiers, who obstruct his way. I am his nearest friend! I should receive His dying words—hold back! (Breaks through them.) O, Damon! Damon! Damon. I wish'd for this, but fear'd it, Pythias! Tush!—we are men, my Pythias, we are men, And tears do not become us. Pyth. Doom and death In the same moment! Is there no hope, Damon? Is every thing impossible? Damon. For me, With Dionysius, every thing.—I crav'd But six hours' respite, that my wife may come, And see me— Pyth. And he would not? Damon. Not an hour— Just to have kiss'd her, and my little boy— Just to have kiss'd her— Pyth. The cold villain! Damon. Well, All that is o'er now, and this talk superfluous. Ere you came up, my friend, I was about To leave a greeting for you with the officer— I bade him say, too,—for, despite of rules Well conn'd and understood, in such a time As this—so sudden, hopeless, and unlook'd for, The eye will water, and the heart grow cowardly, At thoughts of home, and things we love at home; And something like a sorrow, or a fear, For what may happen, will stick in the throat, To choke our words, and make them weak and womanish. Pyth. Tears have a quality of manhood in them, When shed for what we love. Damon. I bade him say, That half my fear for her, and my young boy, As to their future fate, was banished, In the full certainty I felt of all The care and kindness thou wilt have of them. Pyth. That was a true thought, Damon. Damon. I know it, Pythias; O, I know it Pythias; And when the shock of this hath pass'd away, And thou art happy with thy sweet Calanthe,— Pyth. Damon. Damon. Well, Pythias? Pyth. Did'st thou not say It was thy last desire to look upon Thy wife and child, before— Damon. I would give up, Were my life meted out by destiny Into a thousand years of happiness, All that long measure of felicity, But for a single moment, in the which I might compress them to my heart. Pyth. Good Procles, Lead me at once to Dionysius— I mean unto the king—that's his new name— Lead me unto the king—Ha! here he comes! Enter Dionysius and Damocles. Behold me, Dionysius, at thy feet! As thou dost love thy wife, and thy sweet children; As thou art a husband and a father, hear me! Let Damon go and see his wife and child Before he dies—for four hours respite him— Put me in chains; plunge me into his dungeon, As pledge for his return: do this—but this— And may the gods themselves build up thy greatness As high as their own heaven. Dion. What wonder's this? Is he thy brother? Damon. No, not quite my brother? Not—yes, he is—he is my brother! Dion. Damon, is this a quibble of thy school? Pyth. No quibble, for he is not so in kin, Not in the fashion that the word puts on, But brother in the heart! Dion. (To Damon.) Did'st urge him on To this? Pyth. By the gods, no! Dion. And should I grant Thy friend's request, leaving thee free to go, Unwatch'd, unguarded, thou mak'st nought of it, Quite sure that thou wilt come and ransom him, At the imminent time? Damon. Sure of it? Hearest thou, Heaven? The emptiest things reverberate most sound, And hollow hearts have words of boisterous promise. I can say only—I am sure! Dion. 'Tis granted. How far abides thy wife from hence? Damon. Four leagues. Dion. For six hours we defer thy death. 'Tis now The noon exactly; and at the sixth hour See that thou stand'st not far from him; away! Conduct that man to prison. Damon. Farewell, Pythias! Pyth. And farewell, Damon! Not a word upon it. Speed thee. What, tears?—Forbear. Damon. I did not think To shed one tear; but friendship like to thine— Pyth. Farewell! Come, officer. Damon. I pray thee, Procles, Give me the testament thou had'st of me. (Procles gives it him. Pythias, thy hand again: Pythias, farewell! Pyth. Farewell! (Exit Damon on one side, Pythias, Procles, and Guards on the other.) Dion. O, by the wide world, Damocles, I did not think the heart of man was moulded To such a purpose. Dam. It is wondrous. Dion. Wondrous! Sir, it doth win from the old imaginers Their wit and novelty!— I'll visit Pythias in his dungeon:—get me A deep disguise.—We'll use such artifice As the time, and our own counsel may suggest— If they should triumph, crowns are nothingness, Glory is sound—and grandeur, poverty! [Exeunt. Scene III. —Another Street. Enter Damon and Lucullus. Luc. O my dear lord, my master, and my friend, The sight of you thus safe— Damon. Safe! Luc. For at least A respite, my kind lord. Damon. No more, Lucullus. Is my horse ready? Luc. Yes, the gallant grey Of Anaxagoras you lately purchased. Enter Calanthe. Cal. Hold sir!—Is what they tell me true? Damon. Calanthe, At any time save this, thy voice would have The power to stay me—Pr'ythee, let me pass— Nor yet abridge me of that fleeting space Given to my heart. Cal. Speak! have they said the truth? Have you consented to put in the pledge Of Pythias' life for your return? Damon. 'Tis better That I should say to her,—‘Hermion, I die!’ Than that another should hereafter tell ‘Damon is dead!’ Cal. No! you would say to her, ‘Pythias has died for me’—even now the citizens Cried in mine ear, ‘Calanthe, look to it!’ Damon. And do you think I would betray him? Cal. Think of it?— I give no thought upon it—Possibility, Though it should weigh but the least part of a chance, Is quite enough—Damon may let him die— Ay, meanly live himself, and let him die! Damon. Calanthe, I'll not swear—When men lift up Their hands unto the gods, it is to give Assurance to a doubt: But to confirm By any attestation the return Of Damon unto Pythias, would profane The sanctity of friendship.—Fare thee well— Nay, cling not to me. Cal. So will Hermion cling— But Damon will not so reject her.— She will implore thee back to life again, And her loud cries will pierce thy inmost breast, And Pythias will be murder'd. Damon. I must unloose thy grasping. Cal. Mercy, Damon! Damon. Unwillingly I stay thy struggling hands— Forgive me for't. Cal. Damon, have mercy on me! Damon. May the gods bless thee! [Exeunt Damon and Lucullus. Cal. Damon, mercy, Damon! He flies!—and there's a voice that from my heart, As from the grave, cries out, that never more He will return to Pythias.—Hermion—his child— And his own selfish instinct—or some accident May fall, and stay him back, and that will be The axe to Pythias!—O, I will follow him— I'll tell him that, and, like a drowning wretch, Fasten about his neck, and cling to him! But, ah!—he flies—his steed is on the wind! My evil demon wings him, and he tramps Already the wide distance!—Pythias, The flowers in bridal mockery on my brow Thus I rend off, and keep them for the grave! Enter Dionysius disguised. Dion. Thy name's Calanthe, and thou art the bride Of Pythias—is't not thus? Cal. What dost thou come To say to me of Pythias? Dion. Art thou not His bride? Cal. The marriage-temple was prepar'd, The virgin's voices were sent up to Heaven, When death did all at once Rise up, and all that pomp did disappear, And for the altar, I behold the tomb!— He never will return. Dion. He will not. Cal. Ha! Dost thou confirm my apprehensions? They were black enough already—and thy smile— It is the gloss upon the raven's plumes— Thy smile is horrible! Dion. Calanthe, hear me. The tyrant, Dionysius, has resolved To intercept this Damon, and prevent His coming back to Syracuse. Cal. O, gods! Dion. I am an inmate in the tyrant's house, And learn'd his fell decree! Cal. Then, speed thee hence: Mount thou the fleetest steed in Syracuse— Pursue the unhappy Damon—tell him this; I know he has a brave and generous nature, Will not betray his friend! Go after him And save my husband! Dion. I have found a way To rescue him already: thou and Pythias Shall fly from Syracuse. Cal. What! shall he 'scape The tyrant's fangs? Dion. For ever!—But thou must Follow my precept. Cal. I will obey you, sir, And bless you! Dion. Then to Pythias come with me. [Exeunt. Scene IV. —A Terrace attached to the Prison, with the Sea outstretched before it.—A Portal on one side—on the other, the Dungeon-door of Pythias, barred and chained. Enter Dionysius, preceded by an Officer, who points to the Dungeon. Dion. Is this the dungeon?—Unbar the door.— I'll probe him deeply.— Slave! Observe well the orders that I gave thee! [Motions him away, and opens the door. My lord Pythias!— Pyth. (Within) How now! who calls me? Dion. A friend, Pythias:—the time is precious; haste, And follow me. Enter Pythias. Pyth. Where do you lead me? Dion. I come To serve and succour thee. Pyth. And who art thou, And how can'st succour me? Dion. I dwell beneath the tyrant's roof, and learn'd by accident This fell determination—he hath resolv'd— Pyth. My life!— Dion. Thy life!— Ere this, he hath despatch'd some twenty men To intercept thy friend, on his approach To meet and ransom thee. Pyth. Almighty Heaven! Dion. He not arriving at the appointed hour, Thy life is forfeited. Pyth. We try the depth together; I had hop'd That one or other of us could have liv'd For thy poor Hermion's, or Calanthe's sake.— No matter. Dion. Pythias, I came to save thee. Pyth. What dost thou mean? Dion. Urg'd by my pity for such noble friends, So trusting and betray'd—anxious, besides, To-leave the tyrant's court, Hither I brib'd my way.—Thy fair Calanthe Shall be the partner of thy flight.—Thy father— Pyth. Sir!— Dion. Yes, thy father, too—thy time-struck father, Who, till this day, for many circling years Hath not held human intercourse, Was visited by me—he hath uprais'd him From his lonely bed. Pyth. Thou speakest of miracles! Dion. And ere I came, with all despatch and secresy, I have provided in the port of Syracuse A good quick-sailing ship—yonder she lies, Her sails already spread before the breeze, And thou, and thy Calanthe—see, she comes— Haste, lady, haste to thy betrothed lord! Pyth. Wide-working Heaven, Calanthe! Enter Calanthe. Cal. Pythias! Though when thou should'st have cherish'd, thou did'st spurn me, Though in the holy place where we had met To vow ourselves away unto each other, Though there, when I was kneeling at thy feet, Thou did'st forswear, and mock at me—yet here I do forgive thee all—and I will love thee As never woman lov'd her young heart's idol, So thou but speed'st to safety. Pyth. Hold, Calanthe.— If mothers love the babe upon the breast, When it looks up with laughter in it's eyes, Making them weep for joy—if they can love, I loved, and do love thee, my Calanthe:— But wert thou magnified above thyself, As much in fascination as thou art Above all creatures else,—by all the gods, In awful reverence sworn, I would not cheat My honour! Cal. How! Dion. Madman, what dost intend? Pyth. Dost thou not know the tyrant spar'd his life, On the security I gave for him— Stand I not here his pledge? Dion. (Aside.) 'Tis wonderful! His brow is fix'd; his eye is resolute. Cal. Pythias, mine idoliz'd, and tender Pythias,— Am I then scorn'd?—Behold! look, Pythias, there! Pyth. What do I see? Cal. Thy father,—Nicias! He who did give thee being, and the blood That bubbles round thy heart. Since my poor tears Are valueless, hear him, and disobey not. Pyth. Ha! dream I this? Dion. (Aside.) There! he is shaken there! Enter Nicias, extremely old and feeble. Nicias. Where is my son, the child of my old years, The last of all my blood—where is my son? I scarce behold the day-light—where is my son? Pyth. Here, father, here! Nicias. Is this my Pythias' hand? Are these his arms that press me? O, my son, Come to thy father's heart! Child of my age, I do believe thou lov'st me! Pyth. O, my father! Witness these burning tears, tears which came not In such a gush as now. Nicias. Upon my lonely bed, thy long-lost name, Pronounc'd in shrieking anguish to mine ear, Came, and I heard it—the first human sound That for a lapse of time held intercourse With my forgotten heart—and lo! I heard it! And then I ask'd of thee, and what they purpos'd To do on thee—and here I came, my son, To go with thee to safety. Pyth. Spare me that! All things I'll do but that; and that I dare not do. Nicias. The tyrant doth break faith with thee. Pyth. 'Tis said so. Cal. And Damon cannot come to be thy ransom. Pyth. I have heard it, my Calanthe. Cal. And that thou— That thou—O gods!—must die when he comes not? Pyth. And that I know, Calanthe. Cal. If thou knowest it, What is thy heart, that it can still be obstinate? Pyth. I should not have heard it; or, having heard it, I still may hold it false. This busy world Is but made up of slight contingencies— There are a thousand that may alter this, Or leave it where it was:—there is not one Should push us a mere point from any pledge Of manliness and honour. Nicias. Look on thy father, Pythias—he scarce sees His son—darkness has pour'd her waters on him, Quenching the spark that lights up human life, In gay variety; yet I would live. Pyth. And yet would I, my father, Live to support, befriend, and cherish you! Live to possess my own Calanthe here, Who recommends existence with a smile So sad and beautiful!—Yet would I live, But not dishonour'd—Still, Calanthe, he may return! May! may!—That word ends all!—Death looks but grimly, And the deep grave is cheerless—yet I do— I do prefer the certainty of death Unto the possibility of dishonour! Nicias. Pythias, my son, the cold dim house of death— To be a lonely, shuddering tenant in it, Or live in sun-shine one's own young heart gives out! Thy hand, Calanthe; give thy hand, my girl,— And thine, my son—here, take her—save, or lose her! Cal. Thyself, and me! Save both! Dion. Behold! behold!— (Pointing to the side of the stage.) The good ship hath her streaming signal out! The canvass swells up to the wooing wind! The boat puts off—now, now, or never! Cal. See How swiftly, in her gallant liberty, She comes through the calm sea!—O, hark! the oars, How rapidly they plash in harmony! O look at freedom, Pythias, look at it! How beautiful it is upon the sea! Pythias, my Pythias—O! how we shall laugh While bounding o'er the blessed wave that bears us From doom and death, to some fair Grecian isle! Dion. See, they approach! dost hesitate? Nicias. My son! Cal. Pythias!—my husband, Pythias! Pyth. No! no! so help me heaven!—'Tis hard! It plucks my heart up—but, no! no! (Kneels.) Cal. O, gods! (She falls into his arms.) END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. —The Exterior of Damon's Villa. Enter Damon and Lucullus. Damon. At last, I have arriv'd! At last, Lucullus, I've reach'd the place to which my heart did send Its throbbing far before me. [Leans on Lucullus. Luc. Good, my lord. Damon. It is not for the beauty of this place, It is not for the keen intenser sense Existence hath in this delicious spot, Where every breath is a new act of bliss,— Lucullus, no; it is, that here my wife— That here in this enchanting solitude, My boy, my only one—I dare not see them! Lucullus, wer't not better to go back, And die without beholding them? Luc. My lord, The day moves on in Heaven; you have little time Left for this fatal parting. Damon. Come, I must wake My manhood up again!—I will go in At once Lucullus; go thou hence, Lucullus, And tend our horses.—I have scarcely power To lift the latch. (Looks out) O, gods! Luc. What is the matter? Dam. Look! there she is, Lucullus, and my boy Beside her.—She (poor sweet thing!) in the bower Of jasmine, where she knows I love to sit And look upon the setting of the sun, Prepares a little feast for me. Behold, With what a diligence she puts in trim Her banquet of fair fruits!—My little boy, too, Waits at her side, and with uplifted hands Unto her care doth minister! To-day, I said that I should visit her, and this Is meant for my reception.—Come, come, Damon, Be a man again!—Lucullus, take thou care To have our horses ready.—How I tremble! [Exit Damon. Luc. Never shall he return, if there be power In this quick hand to cast an intercept Between him and perdition: though it cost My life, he shall not die; perhaps he'll kill me, But time shall come, when at Lucullus' name, He will lift up his hands, and weep for me! [Exit. Scene II. —A Garden. A Table, with Fruit laid out. Hermion discovered arranging a little Feast.—Her Child beside her, with a basket of Flowers. Child. Will he come soon home, mother? Herm. I pray the gods He may, my child. Child. It seems so long a time Since he hath ta'en me on his knee, and kiss'd me. Herm. Hark thee, my boy! This is the hour, wherein Lucullus said He would arrive to-day to visit us. Go, see if he be coming, he'll be glad To greet the rosy fruit upon thy cheeks, Even as he enters our sweet garden here. Hie thee, and bear me word if he approaches— The first kiss shall be thine. [Exit Child. Herm. Thou unkind Damon! To send me here to woman's loneliness, A prey to all the sickening hopes and fears I must have of thee, in these blustering times. Enter Damon, with the Child in his arms. Child. See, I have found him for you, mother! Herm. Ha! Damon. Hermion! my treasure, Hermion! Herm. My dear lord! I had prepar'd this little feast for you, But hope at last grew sick within my heart And I could hardly force it to a thought That yet thou would'st arrive—Oft I look'd out Upon the weary way thou should'st have journey'd, And oft the hills' dim vapour rose like Damon, Till the sun came to shape it, and to shew me That yet thou wert away. Damon. And are ye then, Are ye so helpless in our absence, Hermion? Herm. Come, now—you know it. O, my dear, dear husband! If I should tell thee of my quaking heart, While thou art bustling there in Syracuse,— Why wilt thou start?—'twould cheat thee of thy tears, And make thee womanish; and—for I know Thou lov'st thy own poor Hermion,—thou should'st swear Never again to leave her. Damon. Nerve me, Heaven! Herm. Indeed thou should'st! and look thee here, my Damon, But for this little boy, who is so like thee— Damon. Is he so very like me, Hermion? Herm. Nay, A very little self of thee;—and, but For looking long into his face—so long That the tears blinded me,—I've half consented To think it was thyself; and then I kiss'd My boy, and I was happy for a time. And but for this, my Damon, and his talk His childish prattle on my knee, of what He would achieve and be—Come, sir, rehearse These matters over; say what would'st thou be? Damon. What would'st thou be, my boy? Child. A soldier, father. Damon. Come, come, now, not a soldier. Child. Nay, but I'd chuse sir, To be what Pythias is. Damon. (Much moved.) Thou art a brave boy! Go pluck a flower from yonder gay recess, At the other end of the garden.—Wreathe me now The fairest garland for my welcome—there— A brave, brave boy. [Exit Child. Now, gods!—(Aside.) Herm. Dost thou not think He grows apace? Damon. Have I in all my life Given thee an angry look, or word, or been Ever an unkind mate, my Hermion? Herm. Never! the gods know, never! Damon. From thy heart Thou sayest this? Herm. Yea, from my inmost heart! Damon. I am glad of it; for thou wilt think of this When I am dead, my Hermion: and 'twill make thee The kindest mother to our boy! Herm. O, gods! Why dost thou talk of death? Damon, thy cheek, Thy lip is quivering—art sick, or griev'd With some discomfiture? O, these wild wars And bickerings of the state, how have they robbed thee Of thy soul's quiet! Damon. Tell me, tell me, Hermion,— Suppose I should impart the heaviest news That could possess thine ear, how would'st thou bear it? Herm. Laugh at it!—mock at it to make thee smile, And teach thee to be happy in despite Of any turn of fortune.—What dost thou mean? What heavy news? I know the part thou takest In the state's service.—Hath the tyrant risen? Damon. He hath; but that's not it. Herm. The Carthagenians Have sack'd the city? Why then thy friend So well beloved of thee—Pythias!—'tis he! Damon. No, thank the gods, not he! Herm. What is it then?— The heaviest news that could possess mine ear!— Ha! 'tis thyself—some danger hath befallen thee, Or threatens thee.—Speak, my dear Damon, speak. Or I shall die of thoughts that come to kill me! Damon. When I wooed thee, Hermion, 'Twas not the fashion of thy face, or form,— Though from the hand of Heaven thou camest so rich In all external loveliness, it was not Such excellence that rivetted my heart And made me thine; but I said to myself, Thus:—Here is one, who, haply were I wreck'd, Or, were I to-morrow, or a later day, Struck down by fortune— Herm. Wert thou made as low From what thou art as earth's foundation-stone Is from the top of Etna—did men scorn thee— Damon. Nay, thus I said, my Hermion:—Did the blow Fall deadly as it might—here is a woman Who hath such firm devotion in her love, She would not rend my heart, but for my sake,— And, should we have a child, for his sake too,— Bear firmly up, though death itself— Herm. Death! death! Damon. (Giving her the testament.) Take this—read this—'twill speak what I cannot— I thought I could, and by the gods I cannot! Herm. Ha! here's a poisoning adder in this scroll— It eats into my heart!—Die, Damon!—Death! When? how? I cannot understand it—Die! Where? what offence? Damon. I have been doom'd to death by Dionysius. Herm. But thou hast 'scaped the sentence; thou art here, Alone! unguarded!—It is but to fly To Greece, or Italy, or any where From this. Damon. From this to Syracuse.—I'll tell thee— Ere now I had been dead— Herm. No! no! Damon. Ere this I had been dead, but that my friend, my Pythias, By putting on my fetters—giving up Himself as hostage for my sure return,— Wrought on the tyrant to bestow me time To see thee here. Herm. By the wide world, thou shalt not! I hold thee here—these arms encompass thee As doth thy heart it's life-spring!— Damon. Not! Herm. Thou shalt not! Damon. Not! not return!—Not go to take my friend Out of the fetters I have hung upon him? Herm. Life! to save that, the wrong becomes the right! The gods that made us have so quicken'd us, Nature so prompts us, and all men forgive it, Because all men would do it.—By the love (If thou hast any) of thy wife and child— Ay, frown—do, Damon, frown, and kill me too, Or live for us! Re-enter Child with flowers. The blessed gods have sent thee With thy sweet helplessness—kneel down, my child, Hold up thy little hands with mine, and pray Not to be made an orphan—not so soon, So very soon!—Kind Damon, look upon us! Husband, look on us, we are at thy feet! Damon. Ye are!—I see it, and my heart bleeds for ye! Nay, I must turn my eyes away from you While you are urging me to my dishonour, And bid me murder him that I may live! Hermion, farewell! (Turning round and embracing her.) Herm. (In agony.) Live Damon! live! live! live! Damon. Hermion, my life, look up! awake my Hermion. (She swoons in his arms.) Enter an old Servant. Damon. The hour is past! I trifle with necessity! Hermion! I now indeed must part from thee, All pale and cold and death-like as thou art; Thus may I part from thee, to go and be Myself full soon as cold!—Here, here, old man, Here, hold her from the earth,— (Giving Hermion to the old Servant.) And say to her, With what a broken-hearted love I press'd her For the last time!—And, Neucles, for my sake Be thou a faithful servant when I am gone! Once more—My child too!—O, this is too much! My little orphan!—my dear boy! the gods, The gods will take my care of thee, my child! [Rushes out. (The Scene shuts.) Scene III. —The Exterior of Damon's Villa. Enter Lucullus. Luc. It is achiev'd! He comes! in desperate haste He rushes from the garden—Shall I fly From the swift fury will await upon The terrible revealment?—'Tis too late! Enter Damon. Damon. 'Tis o'er, Lucullus—Bring thou forth my horse.— I have staid too long, Lucullus, and my speed Must leave the winds behind me: By the gods, The sun is rushing down the west! Luc. My lord— Damon. Why dost thou tremble? Fetch the colour back Into thy cheek, man, nor let thy weak knees Knock on each other in their cowardice! Time flies—be brief—go bring my horse to me! Be thou as swift as speech, or as my heart is! Luc. My lord,— Damon. Why, slave, dost hear me? bring him here! My horse, I say! The hour is past already Whereon I bade old Neucles summon me. Luc. My generous master, do not slay me! Damon. Slave! Art mad? or dost thou mock me in the last And fearfullest extremity?—Yet you speak not! Luc. You were ever kind and merciful, nor yet Commended me unto the cruel whip, And I did love you for it! Damon. Where's my horse? Luc. When I beheld the means of saving you I could not hold my hand—my heart was in it, And in my heart, the hope of giving life And liberty to Damon; and— Damon. Go on! I am listening to thee! Luc. And in hope to save you, I slew your steed! Damon. Almighty heavens! Luc. Forgive me! Damon. I am standing here to see if the great gods Will with their lightning execute my prayer Upon thee! But thy punishment be mine! I'll tear thee into pieces! (Seizes him.) Luc. Spare me! Spare me! 'Tis horrible to die!—I saved thy life,—O do not thou take mine! Damon. My friend! my friend! O that the word would kill thee! Pythias is slain!—his blood is on my soul! He cries, where art thou, Damon? Damon, where art thou? And Damon's here!—The axe is o'er his neck,— And in his blood I'm delug'd! Luc. Spare me! Spare me! Damon. A spirit cries, ‘Revenge and Sacrifice!’ I'll do it—I'll do it—Come.— Luc. Where should I go? Damon. To the eternal river of the dead! The way is shorter than to Syracuse,— 'Tis only far as yonder yawning gulf— I'll throw thee with one swing to Tartarus, And follow after thee!—Nay, slave, no struggling! Pythias is grown impatient! His red ghost Starts from the ground, and with a bloody hand Waves to the precipice! Luc. Have mercy! Damon. Call For mercy on the Furies—not on me! [Exit Damon, dragging Lucullus out.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. —A public Place in Syracuse.—A Scaffold, with steps ascending to it, upon the right hand—In the back of the Stage, the Gates of a Prison.—Executioner, with an Axe, and Guards discovered. Enter Damocles and Procles. Proc. It is a marvellous fantasy, thou speakest of In Dionysius. Dam. Yes, his mind is made Of strange materials, that are almost cast In contrariety to one another. The school and camp in his ambition make A strange division: with the trumpet's call He blends the languor of the poet's lyre! The fierce intrepid captain of the field Hath often on the great Athenian stage Cop'd with the mightiest monarchs of the Muse, And in mine apprehension, he doth prize The applauses of that polished populace More than the rising shout of victory. Proc. And over all that science which doth hold Touching the soul and its affections Its high discoursing hath attracted him. It is his creed that in this flesh of ours Self ever entertains predominance, And to all friendship he hath ever been A persevering infidel. For this, Belike, he tries a strange experiment. What sayest thou? Will Damon come again? It urges on the crisis of the danger. Dam. Our love of life is in the very instinct Of mere material action, when we do Even so slight a thing, as wink an eye Against the wind. Place me a soul-less dog Upon the bare edge of a height, and he Shall shudder and shrink back, though none have prov'd To his capacity that the fall were dangerous. I hold the thing impossible. Proc. He'll not? Dam. What, when he feels his pent-up soul abroad, His limbs unfetter'd, and the mountain-breeze Of liberty all around him, and his life Or death upon his own free choice dependant? 'Tis visionary! Proc. But is there no hope Of Dionysius' mercy? Dam. He'll not give A second's hundredth part to take a chance in. His indignation swells at such a rashness, That in its fling of proud philosophy Can make him feel so much out-soar'd and humbled. What a vast multitude upon the hills Stretch their long blackening outline in the round Of the blue heavens! Proc. They wait the great event. Mute expectation spreads its anxious hush O'er the wide city, that as silent stands As its reflection in the quiet sea. Behold, upon the roof what thousands gaze Towards the distant road that leads to Syracuse! An hour ago a noise was heard afar, Like to the pulses of the restless surge; But as the time approaches, all grows still, As the wide dead of midnight! Calanthe (Without.) There's no power Shall stay me back! I must behold him die, Then follow him! Enter Calanthe, followed by Arria. Arria. My child! Cal. I cannot hear thee! The shrieking of the Furies drowns thy cries! Arria. This is no place for thee—no place Calanthe, For such a one as thou! Cal. No other place Is fit for such a wretch! I am his wife Betrothed, though not married. There is no place For me but at his side: In life or death There is no other. There is the scaffold with the block on it! There is the—O, good gods! Arria. Come back, my child! Good Damocles, give me your aid to bear This wretched woman hence. Cal. O, mother, mother, I'll not be grudg'd that horrible delight! I'll take a long and maddening look of him, Whom in the morning I thought I should have waited, Blushing within the chamber of a bride, And with a heart all full of love and fear, Now I await him in a different place, And with a cheek that ne'er shall blush again; Whose marble may be spotted o'er with blood, But not with modesty: love yet remains, But fear its old companion's fled away, And made room for despair! Enter Dionysius, still in disguise. Ha! are you come? 'Twas you that brought it to me for a guest, And froze the running currents in my bosom To one deep cake of ice! You said too well That Damon would not come—The selfish traitor! The traitor Damon! Dion. Hark thee, Calanthe! It was an idle tale I told to thee! Cal. Ha! Dion. A mere coinage, an invention. Cal. I do not ask thee why that tale was fram'd,— Fram'd in thy cold deliberate cruelty— But only this—one question:—May he yet— May Damon yet return? Dion. He may—he is As free to come, or stay, as are the winds. Cal. And Dionysius withholds him not? Dion. He does not. Cal. Whatsoe'er thou art, the gods For that one word, be unto thee, and thine Guardians for ever!—O, that ray of hope That breaks upon my soul, is worth a flood Of the sweet day-light of Elysium! Damon may yet return!—But, powers of Heaven! Death is prepared already!—What is the time! Dion. Thou may'st perceive by yonder dial-plate, Against the temple, six poor minutes only Are left for his return. Cal. And yet he comes not! O but that temple, where the shade of time Moves unrelentingly, is dedicate To the great Goddess of Fidelity— She will not in the face of her high fane Let such a profanation hurl for ever The altars of her worship to the ground; For who will offer incense to her name If Damon's false to Pythias? Ha! they unbar The ponderous gates!—There is a clank of chains! They are leading him to death! Dam. Bring forth the prisoner! The gates of the Prison are flung open, and Pythias is discovered.—He advances. Cal. Pythias? Pyth. Calanthe here!—My poor fond girl! Thou art the first to meet me at the block, Thou wilt be the last to leave me at the grave! How strangely things go on in this bad world— This was my wedding-day; but for the bride, I did not think of such a one as death! I deemed I should have gone to sleep to-night, This very night—not on the earth's cold lap, But, with as soft a bosom for my pillow, And with as true and fond a heart-throb in it To lull me to my slumber, as e'er yet Couch'd the repose of love.—It was, indeed, A blissful sleep to wish for! Cal. O, my Pythias, He yet may come! Pyth. Calanthe, no!—Remember That Dionysius hath prevented it. Cal. That was an idle tale of this old man, And he may yet return. Pyth. May yet return! Speak!—how is this? return!—O life, how strong Thy love is in the hearts of dying men! Thou art he dids't say the tyrant would prevent His coming back to Syracuse. Dion. I wrong'd him. Pyth. Ha! were it possible!—may he yet come? Cal. Into the sinews of the horse that bears him Put swiftness, gods!—let him outrace and shame The galloping of clouds upon the storm! Blow breezes with him; lend every feeble aid Unto his motion!—and thou, thrice-solid earth, Forget thy immutable fixedness—become Under his feet like flowing water, and Hither flow with him! Pyth. I have taken in All the horizon's vast circumference That in the glory of the setting sun Opens it's wide expanse, yet do I see No signal of his coming!—Nay, 'tis likely— O, no—he could not! It is impossible! Cal. I say, he is false! he is a murderer! He will not come! the traitor doth prefer Life, ignominious, dastard life!—Thou minister Of light, and measurer of eternity In this great purpose, stay thy going down, Great sun, behind the confines of the world! On yonder purple mountains make thy stand! For while thine eye is opened on mankind, Hope will abide within thy blessed beams— They dare not do the murder in thy presence! Alas! all heedless of my frantic cry, He plunges down the precipice of Heaven! Pythias—O, Pythias! Pyth. I could have borne to die, Unmov'd by Dionysius—but to be torn Green from existence by the friend I lov'd,— Thus from the blossoming and beauteous tree Rent by the treachery of him I trusted! No! no! I wrong thee, Damon, by that half thought— Shame on the foul suspicion! he hath a wife, And child, who cannot live on earth without him, And Heaven has flung some obstacle in his way To keep him back, and lets me die who am Less worthy, and the fitter. Proc. Pythias, advance! Cal. No, no! why should he yet? It is not yet— By all the gods, there are two minutes only! Proc. Take a last farewell of your mistress, sir, And look your last upon the setting sun— And do both quickly, for your hour comes on! Pyth. Come here, Calanthe! closer to me yet— Ah! what a cold transition it will be From this warm touch all full of life and beauty, Unto the clammy mould of the deep grave! I pr'ythee, my Calanthe, when I am gone, If thou shoulds't e'er behold my hapless friend, Do not upbraid him! This, my lovely one, Is my last wish—Remember it! Cal. (Who, during this speech has been looking wildly towards the side of the stage.) Hush! Hush! Stand back there! Pyth. Take her, you eternal gods, Out of my arms into your own!—Befriend her! And let her life glide on in gentleness, For she is gentle, and doth merit it. Cal. I think I see it— Proc. Lead her from the scaffold! Pyth. Arria, receive her!—yet one kiss—farewell! Thrice—thrice—farewell!—I am ready, sir. Cal. Forbear! There is a minute left—look there! look there! But 'tis so far off, and the evening shades Thicken so fast, there are no other eyes But mine can catch it—Yet, 'tis there! I see it— A shape as yet so vague and questionable 'Tis nothing, just about to change and take The faintest form of something! Pyth. Sweetest love! Dam. Your duty, officer. Cal. I will not quit him Until ye prove I see it not!—no force Till then shall separate us. Dam. Tear them asunder! Arria, conduct your daughter to her home. Cal. O, send me not away—Pythias, thine arms— Stretch out thine arms, and keep me!—see, it comes! Barbarians!—Murderers!—O, yet a moment— Yet but one pulse—one heave of breath! O, heavens! [She swoons, and is carried away by Arria and Guards. Pyth. (To the Executioner.) There is no pang in thy deep wedge of steel After that parting.—Nay, sir, you may spare Yourself the pains to fit me for the block.— [Drawing the lining of his tunic lower. Damon, I do forgive thee!—I but ask Some tears unto my ashes!— [A shout is heard—Pythias leaps up on the scaffold. By the gods, A horse, and horseman!—Far upon the hill They wave their hats, and he returns it—yet I know him not—his horse is at the stretch (A shout.) Why should they shout as he comes on? It is— No!—that was too unlike—but there now—there! O, life, I scarcely dare to wish for thee, And yet—that jutting rock has hid him from me— No!—let it not be Damon!—he has a wife And child!—gods! keep him back! Damon. (Without) Where is he? [He rushes in, and stands for a moment, looking round. Ha! He is alive! untouched! Ha! ha! ha! [Falls with an hysterical laugh upon the scaffold. (Loud shouts without.) Pyth. The gods do know I could have died for him! And yet I dared to doubt!—I dared to breathe The half-utter'd blasphemy! (Damon is raised up.) He faints!—How thick This wreath of burning moisture on his brow! His face is black with toil, his swelling bulk Heaves with swift pantings—Damon, my dear friend! Damon. Where am I? Have I fallen from my horse That I am stunn'd, and on my head I feel A weight of thickening blood!—What has befallen me? The horrible confusion of a dream Is yet upon my sight.—For mercy's sake, Stay me not back—he is about to die! Pythias, my friend!—Unloose me, villains, or You will find the might of madness in mine arm! (Sees Pyth.) Speak to me, let me hear thy voice! Pyth. My friend! Damon. It pierc'd my brain, and rush'd into my heart! There's lightning in it!—That's the scaffold—there The block—the axe—the executioner!— And here he lives!—I have him in my soul! (Embraces Pyth.) Ha! ha! ha! Pyth. Damon! Damon. Ha! ha! I can but laugh!—I cannot speak to thee! I can but play the maniac, and laugh! Thy hand!—O, let me grasp thy manly hand!— It is an honest one, and so is mine! They are fit to clasp each other! Ha! ha! ha! Pyth. Would that my death could have preserv'd thee! Damon. Pythias, Even in the very crisis to have come,— To have hit the very forehead, of old time! By heavens! had I arriv'd an hour before I should not feel this agony of joy,— This triumph over Dionysius! Ha! ha!—But did'st thou doubt me? Come, thou did'st— Own it, and I'll forgive. Pyth. For a moment. Damon. O that false slave!—Pythias, he slew my horse, In the base thought to save me!—I would have kill'd him, And to a precipice was dragging him, When from the very brink of the abyss I did behold a traveller afar, Bestriding a good steed—I rush'd upon him, Choking with desperation, and yet loud In shrieking anguish, I commanded him Down from his saddle; he denied me—but Would I then be denied? as hungry tigers Clutch their poor prey, I sprung upon his throat. Thus, thus I had him, Pythias? Come, your horse, Your horse, your horse, I cried. Ha! ha! ha! Dion. (Advancing.) Damon! Damon. I am here upon the scaffold! look at me; I am standing on my throne; as proud a one As yon illumin'd mountain, where the sun Makes his last stand; let him look on me too; He never did behold a spectacle More full of natural glory. Death is—Ha! All Syracuse starts up upon her hills, And lifts her hundred thousand hands! She shouts, Hark, how she shouts! (Shouts heard.) O, Dionysius, When wert thou in thy life hail'd with a peal Of hearts and hands like that one? Shout again! Again, until the mountains echo you, And the great sea joins in that mighty voice, And old Enceladus, the Son of Earth, Stirs in his mighty caverns. Tell me, slaves, Where is your tyrant? Let me see him now; Why stands he hence aloof? Where is your master? What is become of Dionysius? I would behold, and laugh at him. Dionysius advances between Damon and Pythias (Damon being on the scaffold) and throws off his disguise. Dion. Behold me! Damon &amp; Pyth. How? Dion. Stay your admiration for awhile, Till I have spoken my commandment here. Go, Damocles, and bid a herald cry Wide through the city, from the eastern gate Unto the most remote extremity, That Dionysius, tyrant as he is, Gives back his life to Damon. (Exit Damocles. Pyth. How, Dionysius! Speak that again. Dion. I pardon him. Pyth. O, gods! You give his life to Damon? Dion. Life and freedom. (Damon remains mute with astonishment upon the scaffold.) Pyth. O, Dionysius! O, my sovereign! Life And freedom! Let me fall down at your feet And open all the sluices of my heart, In one wild gush of weeping gratitude! O, Damon! (Damon still continues motionless. Dion. Almighty virtue, Now do I own, and worship thee! I see The glorious spark which the Eternal One Struck from himself into the soul of man, Blaze up in such excelling majesty, It awes, while it illumes my heart. What hoa! How, Damon, is it with thee? Come, descend! Let me conduct thee from this place of death, Into the bosom of your friend. Pyth. O, Damon! Damon. Pythias—good Dionysius—no, I cannot; Lend me your hand, good Pythias—I could weep. (They take each other's hands, and remain looking at each other. Dion. Until this wondrous hour I walk'd in error, And liv'd in darkness! Either my heart was born Blind to the light of virtue, or some film Hath crept upon its fine susceptibility. Pythias, 'twas I that visited your dungeon, To put your faith unto the test—and one thing Hath griev'd me in its issue—your old father— Pyth. He is dead? Dion. The shock was terrible! Pyth. The earth Lie lightly on his bosom! Dion. But here is The loveliest face that ever yet was worn By consolation! Enter Calanthe. Cal. O, my Pythias! Pyth. Calanthe! Cal. My dear husband! Pyth. Thou hast heard all? Cal. Yes—through the city a loud voice goes forth, Of love, and life, and holy gratitude, And piety, and exultation. “The gates of all the temples are thrown open, “And the gods look more beautiful within. “O, Damon! I must thank thee with such news “As will awake thee to the keenest sense “That ever thrill'd through life!—Husband, awake! “Hermion even now arrives in Syracuse! “Damon. Hermion! “Cal. And let the father start!—thy child— Damon. “My child too! Mighty gods!” I did not yet, In the wild wonder of recover'd life, Appreciate the blessing; but it rushes Now, full and deep, in one wide gush of joy! “My wife!—my child!—Where is my wife, Calanthe? “Where is my child? “Hermion. (Without.) Damon! “Enter Hermion. “Damon. My wife! my wife! “I'll take thee all, and crush thee in my heart! “Yet is there something wanting—I must have “The cup of joy fill'd higher. I am drunk “Already with it, but not satisfied “Till I have quaff'd it unto madness! Ha! “My child! “Enter Lucullus, with the Child of Damon, and Damocles. “Boy! boy! there are who will dare to call “Thy father coward at his ecstasy “In getting back existence. Tell them, boy, “They never yet were fathers! Dionysius! “I now can thank thee. I before refrain'd “From saying aught to thee;—but look here! O, gods, “What it is to be a father!—(Embracing the Child, and weeping.” Dion, Damon, and Pythias, You have rewarded me: I now begin To taste of pleasures never touch'd before— Perfect the work you have begun—“the heavens “With length of life, and lives of transport bless you! “Each day the happiest, and yet the next “Eclipsing that in all comparison! “Thus may the world have opportunity “To wonder at you, and grow better by you!” And I myself, by the continued light Of your example, may at last essay To tread such wondrous ways of virtue with you The lines between inverted commas are omitted in representation.!

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. SPOKEN BY MISS FOOTE. Ladies!—to-night, a bard—an Irish poet— (I mention this, as some few may not know it) Comes forward, with an anxious heart, to claim Your help to lift him up the hill of fame. Don't be alarm'd;—no manual aid I ask;— White hands were never made for such a task: Yet they may, surely,—look!—light as a feather, Surely, just press their pretty palms together; 'Twill make the gentlemen, who stand beside 'em, Applaud with might and main—else woe betide 'em! Woe to their collars! to their wigs disorder, If they should fail, when ladies give the order! But, soft! I see some gentlemen who 've come Alone, and left their wives (for once) at home.— I'll ask 'em—no, I cannot—yet I'll venture:— Pray, sir, are you (I hope not) a dissenter? I don't mean, are you clergyman or layman; But do you like our play? my husband Damon? The fair Calanthe? my lord's good friend Pythias? Or the Sicilian tyrant Dionysius? Pray don't be biass'd—speak out loud and free: And, pray, sir, how d'ye like—what folly!—me? The story which we 've shown to you, our jury, Is taken from a fact, I do assure ye; By the historians old, 'twas reckon'd good, And we,—we did it ably as we could: Considering that we also have our fears, Like authors, and must shed a sea of tears, And storm, and talk big words, and tear our hair, And sink (in attitudes) to deep despair, All this is really no such easy task; Therefore,—'tis but what first I dar'd to ask,— Will you, fair ladies—gentlemen, obey!— Permit our bard to thrive his little day?</field>
