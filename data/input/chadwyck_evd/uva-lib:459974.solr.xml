      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Godfrey, General of the Christian Forces in the Expedition against the Saracens, to engage the Assistance of Rinaldo a famous Hero of those Times; promises to give him his Daughter Almirena, when the City of Jerusalem shou'd fall into his Hands. The Christians with Rinaldo at their Head, conquer Palestine, and besiege its King Argantes in That City. Armida an Amazonian Enchantress, in Love with, and belov'd by Argantes, contrives by Magick, to entrap Rinaldo in an Enchanted Castle, whence, after much Difficulty, being deliver'd by Godfrey, he returns to the Army, takes Jerusalem, converts Argantes and Armida to the Christian Faith, and Marries Almirena, according to the Promise of her Father Godfrey.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The City of Jerusalem besieg'd, A Prospect of the Walls, and a Gate on the plainest side of the Town. Part of the Christian Camp on the right side of the Stage; Enter Godfrey, attended by Almirena, Rinaldo, and Eustatio, and surrounded by his Guards. Godfrey, Almirena, Rinaldo, Eustatio. Godfrey. Now great Rinaldo, have our Warlike Toils Nigh reach'd their wish'd Reward. Yon Tow'ring Walls Shall shortly feel the shock of Christian Pow'r! Their Eastern Sun shines with redoubled Rays, To light our righteous Arms the Way to Sion! O'er craggy Rocks of steep Ascent, The Road to Glory lies, And empty Joys, or dull Content The Brave with Ease despise. O'er craggy, &amp;c. Rin. Asia, great Sir, pierc'd by your wise Commands, Beneath the Thund'ring of this warlike Arm, Groans, at the near Approach of Ruin's Tread. Those impious Tow'rs, their Masters last vain Hope, Shall at the mention of thy glorious Name, Tumble, unbatter'd, down, and crush the Slaves, Unworthy of a Sword, so fam'd as thine, Remember then, victorious Prince, my Claim To Almirena's Charms;â Let Marriage smile, And bless my Heart and Hand with equal Joy. All Virtues join'd grow stronger. Godf. Undaunted Hero, tho' no hostile Force, Can shake thy mighty Mind; Yet in the Road to Glory fall not back, But pass by Love when thy fair Fame invites Thee. When Sion, falling, shall more glorious rise, Be Almirena's Love Rinaldo's Prize. Alm. Consider lov'd Rinaldo, each Delay. Stamps a grim Spot on the bright Face of War; Go fight, successful 'gainst our Faith's proud Foe, Till Sion's freed from her inglorious Yoke. Then gay with Conquest, come triumphant back, And boast how bravely Mars has won his Venus. The Force of Love has Valour oft suppress'd, And Glory freezes in an amorous Breast. Go Fight and succeed, For each Drop you shall bleed, Will encrease the dear Flame in my Breast; 'Tis Glory and Fame, Win the generous Dame, And the Conqueror's Courtship is best. Go Fight, &amp;c. Eust. Illustrious Warrior, mark these Counsels well, Ungovern'd Passions easily Rebel. Rin. How mighty is thy Pow'r blind God of Love! Love delay'd is bitter Anguish, Fear and Torments still succeed, Hope decays and Pleasures languish, Now my Heart has learnt to bleed. Love delay'd, &amp;c. SCENE II. A Trumpet Sounds, and the City Gate being thrown open, discovers a Herald, attended by two Guards, who advances towards Godfrey, &amp;c. Herald. Thou mighty Chief, whose vast capacious Soul Rivals the starry Height of Heavenly Pow'r; By me the King my Master bids Thee hail; And not contented, that the Tongues of Slaves Shou'd speak his sovereign Pleasure, comes himself To a free Conference. Godf. Why, let him come, My Honour is his Passport. Eust. We shall hearâ What strange Proposals this fierce Monarch makes. On the fickle Wheel of Fortune, Hope is always turning round, But a Heart with Virtue strengthen'd, Is for ever constant found. On the, &amp;c. SCENE III. Argantes from the City, drawn through the Gate in a Triumphal Charriot, the Horses white and led in by arm'd Blackamoors. He comes forward attended by a great Number of Horse and Foot Guards, and descending from his Chariot addresses himself to Godfrey, who advances to meet him. Arg. The hissing Snakes of Envies Locks And Scylla barking from her Rocks, Cou'd I around me hear, Shou'd stabbing Pain invade my Breast, And racking Poyson break my Rest, This Heart wou'd scorn to fear. The hissing, &amp;c. (To Godf.) Christian, That Strumpet Fortune, That hitherto has on thy Rapines smil'd, Is still inconstant and can change her Mind. If then thou art but Wise, as thou art Brave, To recompense the mighty Ills thou'st done, Be once by Reason led; For three short Days Suspend the Rage of War. Nay wait not Thought A three Days Truce will three Days Safety give. Godf. He that on Virtue builds the Aim of War, Needs never fear the blackest Turn of Fate, Thou with disdainful Accents seek'st to cloath A poor Petition; and I grant thy Pray'r; For generous Souls are far more flow to ask, Than to bestow, like me. No, let it ne'r be said, That I gave Cause of Woe, My Soul, by Honour led, Wou'd only Peace bestow, Sublime beyond Measure, Most sweet is the Pleasure, Which the Generous know. No let, &amp;c. SCENE IV. Argantes alone. Oppress'd with Doubts of War, my anxious Breast Forgets the Touch of Peace. But far more strong, Love and Armida rack my hurried Soul; Armida, full of Wisdom, and of Force, At once my Mistress, and my brave Allie, Now absent from her Lover's longing Eyes, In the dark Cyphers of mysterious Fate, Seeks to read means to save this Land and me. Come delightful lovely Creature, Bring me Comfort in thy Eye, Arm'd with Charms, thy every Feature, Strait can make my Sorrows fly, Come delightful, &amp;c. SCENE V. Armida in the Air, in a Chariot drawn by two huge Dragons, out of whose Mouths issue Fire and Smoke. Armida Descending. Ye Furies most terrible, Follow me, Surround me With Faces most horrible, Ye Furies, &amp;c. The Chariot being descended, The Dragons rush forward, and draw her towards Argantes, who advances to meet her. Arg. How timely, Charmer, art thou thus arriv'd, To heal the Wounds of my disorder'd Soul! I, who, at thy Departure, felt such Grief, Was all Impatience for thy wish'd Return; The Christian Tyrant grants the Truce propos'd, Say, may our Asia thence resume lost Hope? Arm. As much perplex'd as all Fates Riddles are, I, with tremendous Charms, have plung'd my search Down to the deepest Chanels of her Will! My Pow'r has forc'd from her obscure Abyss, This clear Prediction of thy Country's Hepe, If, from the hostile EuropÃ¦an Camp, The great Rinaldo's Aid can be withdrawn, Asia, now desolate, may smile again. Arg. I fly to stab the Slaveâ Arm. Argantes hold! 'Tis not the force of Arms, but Art like mine, Must draw that fated Hero from their Camp, I'll find a safer Wayâ Arg. Why thenâFarewelâ In Thee, and Thee alone, my Soul confides. Armida alone. Much I resolve and more I hope, Doubt is below my Soul; Wou'd Heaven but give my Fortune scope, I wou'd the Stars controul. Much I, &amp;c. SCENE VI. A delightful Grove in which the Birds are heard to sing, and seen flying up and down among the Trees. Almirena. Charming Birds thus sweetly singing, Zephyrs, every Odour bringing, All ye Beauties of the Grove, Teach me how to find my Love. Charming Birds, &amp;c. Come my ador'd and bless me with thy Presence. Enter Rinaldo. Rin. Charm'd by the Magick of those pow'rful Lips, My hurrying Soul flies outward to thy Call; I'm not prophane; but if I kneel to Thee, My Idol's Brightness will my Guilt attone; That spotless Flame, your Virtue kindled up, Your Beauty sets a blazing in my Soul; Share in the Heat, or cool my scorch'd Desire. Alm. How lovely terrible in those dear Eyes, Shines the fierce Light'ning of Love's brightest Heav'n! Rin. For Thee alone, Thou Goddess of my Wishes, In humble Sacrifice my Off'rings burn, For Thee my Incense smoaks in Sighs of Love! Alm. Thou art the Calm of Peace, when my poor Mind Is toss'd in Storms of War.â Rin. Thy Presence gives me Life, and Death thy Absence. Alm. Gazing with heedless Wonder on thy Face, The sporting Graces smil'd me into Love. Rin. Loves God has plac'd an Ambush in thy Lips, And ev'ry sallying Accent makes a Slave. SONG in Two Parts, by Rin. and Alm.. Love Enchanting all my Senses, To thy Beauties native Fire, Adds a thousand sweet Offences, Which at once bid Hope retire, And invite us to Desire. Love Enchanting, &amp;c. SCENE VII. Armida enters and seizing forcibly on Almirena's Hand, is leading her away. Arm. To the superior Courage of my Arm, Yield Thou this noble Prize. Alm. Aid me ye Pow'rs! Rin. Yield Almirena? Noâ I'll never yield her, till with Lightning charg'd The Thund'rer shall demand her. Arm. Then thus, presumptious shall my Claim make Way. They have drawn their Swords, and are making at each other; when a black Cloud descends, all fill'd with dreadful Monsters spitting Fire and Smoke on every side. The Cloud covers Almirena and Armida, and carries 'em up swiftly into the Air, leaving in their Place, two frightful Furies, who having grinn'd at, and mock'd Rinaldo, sink down, and disappear. Rinaldo alone. Where art Thou gone, my Love, my dear betroth'd? Where are thy Beauties now? Return alas! Thou ravish'd Heav'n, return To an abandon'd Lover's sad Complaint, And save a Life, that dies for loss of Thee; But shall I bear this Loss? No Furies, no! Here on the very Borders of your Hell, Disdainful of your black Resolves I stand, And bear my Vengeance in my dreadful Hand. SCENE VIII. Godfrey, Eustatio, &amp;c. enter to Rinaldo, who stands immoveable with his Eyes fix'd on the Ground. Godf. What unaccustom'd Grief, illustrious Friend, Has fix'd those piercing Eyes? Eust. What wondrous Chance Has from thy Looks exhal'd the sparkling Fire? Thou, that like fabled Jove, Wer't wont to hurl loud Thunder thro' the Camp; Can'st thou be subject to a Change like this? Can Sadness seize Rinaldo? Rin. Such new Amazement has my Senses seiz'd, Such Grief unbounded, galls my panting Soul, That 'tis with mortal Pain my Words find way; As here in Peace and Innocence I stood, And held the lovely Almirena's Hand, Unbosoming my heavy Load of Love, A furious Amazon, (O painful Thought) Entred, and fiercely seiz'd the trembling Maid. Can'st thou feel this, ungrateful Heart, And dost not nobly burst with Grief? If thou so basely stupid art, My Rage shall give my Woe Relief. Can'st thou &amp;c. Enrag'd, I, swift as Light'ning, drew my Sword, In the Defence of my assaulted Dear, When an amazing Host of Hell's black Fiends, With sudden Horrour, burst in Clouds upon me,â And, in a moment hurried, thro' the Air, My Mistress, and my FoeâPluto, perhaps, Mistook the Fair one for his Proserpine, And, ravish'd with her Charms, has stole her from me. Godf. Paternal Sorrow freezes up my Thoughts. Eust. Unusual, and amazing Accident! But hope Rinaldo, Brother droop not thus; Not distant far from you tall Mountain's Foot, A gloomy Cave of rocky Entrance lies, Where dwells a Man, who by his magick Skill, Can read the starry Characters of Heav'n; And tell the Virtues, Stones and Herbs contain; This Man, by long familiar Converse bound, Is my fast, faithful Friend; thither we'll go, And from his Councils our best Measures know. Godf. Revive, distemper'd Heart! Eust. 'Tis brave to hope! Valour with Virtue, nobly join'd, To certain Triumph leads us, And teaches glorious Means to find The Fair distress'd that needs us. Valour with, &amp;c. All but Rinaldo go out. SCENE IX. Rinaldo alone. A Ray of Hope returns with lightsome Beams, To cheer my fainting Soul; Yes, lovely Fair, I fly to bring thee Aid, Give me thy Wings thou God of faithful Love. Winds and Tempests lend me Swiftness, Let me hurl thy Thunder Jove, To revenge me on those Wretches, That wou'd rob me of my Love. Winds and, &amp;c. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Prospect of a Calm and Sunshiny Sea, with a Boat at Anchor close upon the Shore; at the Helm of the Boat sits a Spirit, in the Shape of a lovely Woman. Two Mermaids are seen Dancing up and down in the Water. Eustatio. We have now in our sight The wish'd Port of Delight, And our Pain is rewarded with Pleasure; Glad Triumph returning, We banish all Mourning, And Hope is our Treasure. We have, &amp;c. SCENE II. Godfrey, Rinaldo, Eustatio. Rin. How tedious is the Journey you have led me? And how much cruel Distance yet remains, 'Twixt me, and that desir'd Magician's Cave, Whose balmy Counsels are to cure my Sorrows? Godf. When shall our weary Feet with prosp'rous Steps Approach that sacred Ground? Eust. The rugged Confines of this smiling Lake, Nigh border on the Cell; E're yet the Sun Has fully measur'd out six Beats of Time, Our Journey will have End. SCENE III. While they are crossing to pursue their Journey, the Woman in the Boat invites Rinaldo to enter. Woman. If fam'd Rinaldo, thou woud'st reap the Sweets Of Almirena's Wishes, and her Pray'rs, Her Pray'rs and Wishes, sacred both to thee, Enter this ready Boat; 'twas Her Command Dispatch'd me hither; Her Command alone, Whose stedfast Love, deserves and wants thy Help, Where, to a solitary Isle confin'd, She waits thy wish'd Arrival; Oh be swift! Or she may fear the Waters of this Sea Can quench a Love, that scorns so vile a Conquest. While they remain Confounded at this unexpected Summons, the Mermaids Sing and Dance in the Water. Mermaids. Your Lovely May Of Life when Gay Youth unheeding Counsel needing Pass away in Love delighting, Fame will leave you, Wealth deceive you, He alone true Bliss possesses Whom return'd Affection blesses, And the Fair are still inviting. Your Lovely, &amp;c. Rin. A sudden Beam of Love-directing Light Breaks on my doubtful Thoughts, and bids me go. He stands a while suspended within his Thoughts; at last resolves violently to enter the Boat; but is held by Godfrey and Eustatio. Rin. Yes my belov'd, my Life, my Almirena, I fly to save thee; Godf. Mighty Warrior, hold! Check your unwary Rage! Eust. Quench this false Fire; Rin. I hope, I fear, trust, and despair together! He thinks again, and the Woman renewing her Invitation, he once more attempts an Entrance, but is again with-held by his Companions. Woman. Haste, haste Rinaldo, thy lost Love invokes Thee? Rin. Forgive me injur'd fair One, thus I fly; Godf. Thy Glory! Rin. Perish Glory; Eust. But thy Judgment! Rin. Judgment is dead; Godf. Bridle this impious Rage; Rin. I ought not, cannot; Eust. Think on thy Attempt, How full of Horrours! Rin. Horrours fright not me; Godf. Sion demands thee; Rin. And my Soul invites me; Eust. Styx is behind thee; Godf. And black Hell gapes wide; Rin. I'll force ten thousand Hells to save my Bride; Three headed Cerberus in Chains My Sword shall triumph o'er, I'll shake the Realms where Pluto reigns, And make his Devils feel the Pains, Alcides taught 'em once before. Three headed, &amp;c. He breaks violently from their Hold, and enters the Boat; which immediatly steers out into the open Sea, and Sails out of Sight, Then the Mermaids leave Singing and disappear. Godfrey and Eustatio, seem confounded at the Accident. Eust. Never was Courage thus misled before! To trust these faithless Waves, and vain Illusions, With all his Load of Glory! Godf. 'Twas ill resolv'd! Triumphant Hell ne'er knew a stranger Conquest; How can my Heart, unbroken, bear such Grief! My dearest Daughter ravish'd from my Eye, And Europe's Hope, with this great Hero, lost; Valour and Virtue quit not now my Breast; My Heart's unus'd to bow, Instruct me Fortune now, To Die or Conquer; Glory which cannot fail, When Miseries prevail, Lives but the longer. My Heart's, &amp;c. SCENE IV. A Delightful Garden in the Enchanted Palace of Armida. Almirena, Argantes. Alm. Armida! most inhumane Sorceress! Thus, unprovok'd by any Act of mine, To snatch me from my Joy, and here confin'd, Torment me with eternal Views of Sorrow! Arg. Divinest Creature, let not Grief's black Shade Ecclipse the beamy Beauties of thy Face; My simpathizing Heart is touch'd with Woe To hear thy just Complainings. Alm. Give my big Tears their way: Arg. Those Tears, bright Maid, Deaden the Fire which Love has kindled in me; Alm. Oppress'd, and troubled as you see me now, Judge if my trembling Breast has room for Love! Permit the wretched to complain Of their unhappy Fate; The Loss of Liberty's a Pain That shou'd our Sighs create; When you wou'd comfort an afflicted Mind, Pity not Love, shou'd make you kind. Permit the, &amp;c. Arg. You are the Queen of my submissive Will, And with despotick Power may give me Laws! Alm. Ah! 'tis not true! Arg. Wou'd you behold a Proof? This faithful Sword shall lead you to my Heart, And cut you out a Road to Demonstration: Alm. Alas I wish not that! Oh! did you love me! Arg. What can convince you of my Faith? Alm. My Liberty. Arg. Oh hard Command! Alm. Oh, ill dissembled Passion! Arg. What if while I, ambitious of thy Love, Contrive thy wish'd Release, Armida's Skill Shou'd give her fatal Notice of my Falsehood! How shall we both be tortur'd with Revenge, While Jealousy, Love, and infernal Rage, Excite her keen Resentment! Alm. Why then, uninterrupted let me weep; Arg. No, gather Courage fair One, 'tis resolv'd, This Arm shall burst the magick Chain that binds thee; That Face so full of Beauty, Inspires with Love and Duty My Will, your Slave; Only to view those Eyes Where Cupid's Store-house lyes Will make me brave. That Face, &amp;c. SCENE V. Armida alone. Let Groves of Laurel shoot around my Head, To Crown this last great Triumph of my Skill: Rinaldo, proud Rinaldo! The mightiest Terrour of our Asian Arms, Now brought an humble Captive to my Feet, Shall on the Altars of my fierce Revenge, Fall a lamented Victim to my Pow'r! Guide him obsequious Spirits to my Presence. SCENE VI. Enter two Spirits leading in Rinaldo. Rin. Smil'st thou, perfidious Hag? Art thou a Devil And has not Hell inform'd thee, that a Soul, Daring as mine, can scorn thy Fiends and thee! Know I defie thy Pow'r; for Proof whereof, Give me my Almirena or thou diest; Arm. Before Armida's Face this Insolence? Rin. Find me a Devil yet blacker than thy self! And I'll again repeat how much I scorn thee; Arm. Dost thou not know thou art my Prisoner here? Rin. Fool! Dost thou think thy Chains can reach my Soul? Arm. Thy Life is in my Pow'r! Rin. I tell thee Hag; That Courage cannot die! Arm. Methinks there shines, I know not what gay something in his Look, That draws me up to wonder! (aside Rin. Hear me, Fiend, Restore me to the Arms of Almirena. Arm. I feel a Pain so different from all Pains I e'er yet felt, that I half fear 'tis Love! (aside Rin. Lead me, where Almirena waits my Succour! Arm. But shall my Heart, which never bow'd before, Become the Slave and Triumph of a Foe? (aside Rin. My Rage has slept till now, but thou hast wak'd it, To crush thy self, and thy infernal Train! Arm. 'Tis so, my self must prove the Victim now, Who wou'd have thought that so much Beauty dwelt With so much Roughness? (aside (To him.) Rinaldo, in the rosy Bow'rs around thee, The Wings of ev'ry Wind are charg'd with Love; The purling Streams, which trickle through the Grass, The warbling Birds, and odoriferous Flow'rs, Invite to Softness, and wou'd fain instruct thee, That only amorous Battels here are fought; Unbend that stormy Brow, and smile upon me, No more my Captive now, but Conquerour; Look kindly, while I sigh how much I love thee. Rin. How I detest thy Wiles! Arm. Receive a proffer'd Heart, Rin. To give it Torments. Arm. May Pleasures crown thy Hope. Rin. May Pains dash thine. Arm. Will not Entreaties melt thee? Rin. I disdain 'em. Arm. Have Sighs, like mine, no Force? Rin. To blow up Anger Arm. Hell listens to my Call. Rin. But I am deaf. Arm. Think what I am. Rin. A Tyrant and a Devil. Arm. Resolve onâ Rin. Vengeance. Arm. Cannot Pity move thee? Rin. Why lose I Time? Dear Soul I fly to seek thee. He is going off. Arm. Oh stay! Rin. I will not; Arm. Ungrateful! Kill not; Rin. Inhumane Sorcerers fly; Leave me; Arm. 'Tis Death; Rin. Quit then thy Breath; Arm. Why must I die? O stay, &amp;c. SCENE VII. Armida changes her self into the Likeness of Almirena, and follows Rinaldo, weeping. Arm. Ungrateful, cruel Man! whom I have lov'd, 'Till not a Corner of my Heart is mine! Yet now, regardless of my Tears or Pains, You will not grant one Look to guild my Sorrow! Rin. Ha! are my Eyes deceiv'd? what do I see? My Heav'n! My Soul's best half! Let me embrace thee! Arm. While I, unhappy, mourn thy cruel Absence, Thou of a Nature changing, and unkind, With some new Mistress laugh'st away the Hours, Forgetful of a gentle Maid, that loves thee; Rin. Alas! My Heart is bound so firmly to thee, That ev'n Inconstancy wants Strength to loose it; But I, by strange delusive Magick, led, Mistook thee, lovely Creature, for Armida; Arm. Thus let my Arms enfold my Soul's Desire! Rin. What Lover wou'd be happier than Rinaldo? While they Embrace, Armida reassumes her proper Shape, and Rinaldo amaz'd, starts back in a sudden Confusion. Rin. Gigantick Horrours wrap'd in Hells dark Mists Shadow my frighted Soul! Oh! Tricks of Fate! Why sleeps the Thunder in an idle Sky? When Heav'n can never hurl his hottest Bolts At Guilt more black than this! Armida again takes the Shape of Almirena. Arm. Why start you thus? And wherefore roll those Eyes in Clouds of Terrour? Rin. And is it really Thee? [Is running to her Arms but stops suddenly. But hold fond Heart! What wou'd my Madness do? Beneath those Charms There lies a Magick Hell, shaded from sight, By the most tempting Front of Paradise; I burn, I freeze, I fry, Midst Fury and Disdain, Now live, now doubt, now die, Deceiv'd in all I try, And torn with endless Pain! I burn, &amp;c. SCENE VIII. Armida in her proper Shape. Arm. And cannot then the Beauties of my Youth, The promis'd Joys I offer'd to his View, Nor Hells big Threatnings, lure him to my Will? And thou, my Heart rejected, and disdain'd, Art still the vain Implorer of his Love? No! Let me rouze slow Vengeance from her Cell, And strike the curs'd ungrateful Monster dead! Yet, Oh mad Hand! what wou'd thy Rage attempt? Must he, in whom I live, feel Death from me? Oh strange Effect of Love! Oh Coward Breast, That gives a Traitor Room, and fear'st to hurt him! 'Tis gone, the fond Desire! and Reason reigns! Rise all ye Furies that obey my Call, And shake your wiry Whips to whet my Rage; I'll find some new unheard of Punishment; Toâbut alas! He is too Fair to die! Cruel Charmer I that love thee, Fain wou'd move thee with my Pain; 'Tis with Grief that cold I prove thee, Lov'd so truly, love again. Cruel Charmer, &amp;c. SCENE IX. Enter Argantes, at whose coming Armida again takes upon her the Appearance of Almirena. Arm. I will once more resume my Rival's Form, That so Argantes may not see me mov'd, And if the hated, lov'd Rinaldo comes, I may again deceive my self and him! Arg. Each small Delay, my lovely Almirena, Which my bold Hope encounters in thy Love, Is painful and afflicting to my Thought; Armida views him scornfully. Why are thy Looks to wear this sudden Change? Cannot those starry Beauties of thy Face, Shine, but through Clouds upon me? She Eyes him more disdainfully than before. Prithee Love, Look on me with the Eye of Recompence; For shortly thou shalt see thy self redeem'd From the ignoble Bondage of Armida. She starts, and appears surpriz'd. Still are thy Looks perplex'd? Believe me Charmer My Courage and my Knowledge join to serve thee. Armida takes her own Shape, and flyes on him with great Fury. Arm. Traitor, is this the best Reward thou giv'st me? Arg. What do I see ye Pow'rs! Arm. I that have lov'd you! Arg. I own my self oblig'd; Arm. I that, to aid thee, Arm'd half the Host of Hell! Arg. 'Tis true you've serv'd me; Arm. That I shou'd thus be cheated and betray'd! Arg. Excuse a random Shot of hoodwink'd Love; Arm. Soon shalt thou hear the Thunder of my Vengeance, Arg. Forgive me my Offence; Arm. Traitor I will not; Arg. The Shame I feel is a sufficient Penance; Arm. Deceiver, no. Arg. Why then, proud Soceress know, I own my Love to Almirena's Charms. Arm. I will withdraw the Aid my Friendship lent thee, Arg. Leave me whene'er thou wilt, my Sword alone, Without thy Devils can defend my Throne; [he goes off enrag'd. Arm. Gods and Men will justly aid me, To revenge a Wrong so great, Till the Wretch that has betray'd me, Shall repent the Guilt too late. Gods and, &amp;c. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A dreadful Prospect of a Mountain, horridly steep, and rising from the Front of the Stage, to the utmost Height of the most backward Part of the Theatre; Rocks, and Caves, and Waterfalls, are seen upon the Ascent, and on the Top appear the blazing Battlements of the Enchanted Palace, Guarded by a great Number of Spirits, of various Forms and Aspects; In the midst of the Wall is seen a Gate, with several Arches supported by Pillars of Chrystal, Azure, Emeralds, and all sorts of precious Stones. At the Foot of the Mountain is discover'd the Magicians Cave. Enter Godfrey, Eustatio, and their Soldiers, gazing on the dreadful appearance of the Mountain. Eustatio. Methinks this looks as if rebellious Earth, Wou'd once more lift her Arms to fight with Heav'n! Godf. Is this the Period of our long Fatigue? Eust. This is the solitary Sages Cell; Godf. Summon the Holy Man from his Retirement. Eustatio calls at the Cell's Mouth. Eust. Thou whose superiour Knowledge and high Fate Has giv'n thee Pow'r to read Heav'ns starry Book! And find the dark Events of Deeds to come! Vouchsafe thy wish'd Advice to us thy Friends, Urg'd by no trifling Cause to beg thy Aid! SCENE II. The Magician appears at the Mouth of the Cave. Magician. That supernat'ral Pow'r which helps my Art, Long e'er your coming, told me why you came; Rinaldo and the beauteous Almirena, High on the Summit of yon dreadful Hill, Slaves to the fierce Armida's Pleasure lye. Thither no Mortal Courage can arrive, Unless high Heav'n shall please to lend a Force, Equal to that of Hell, which guards her Palace. Godf. My Sword shall be my Guide. Eust. My Virtue mine. Godf. Follow ye faithful Sharers of my Glory. Eust. Thus let me lead you on to noble Victory. Godfrey and Eustatio, with drawn Swords, and follow'd by their Soldiers, ascend the Mountain, regardless of the Magician who calls after them. Magician. Forbear you mad unthinking Braves forbear, Soon shall your Ship of Hope a Tempest meet, Will drown you in a wondrous Sea of Terror. Godfrey, Eustatio and the Soldiers, having climb'd half way up the Mountain, are stopp'd by a Row of ugly Spirits, who start up before 'em; The Soldiers, frighted, endeavour to run back, but are cut off in their Way by another Troop, who start up below 'em. In the midst of their Confusion, the Mountain opens and swallows 'em up, with Thunder, Lightning, and amazing Noises. Godfrey, Eustatio, and the Soldiers who escape, return in great Confusion to the Magician's Cave. Godf. The dreadful River of impetuous Death Rolls down upon us! Eust. Stormy Acheron Vomits her blackest Horrours on our Heads! Magician. Wonder not, mighty Warriours, that you sail'd; To Earthly Valour it was never given, Alone to vanquish Hell's infernal Rage. But take these fatal Wands, and then return, Secure of bearing Conquest where you go; No Witchcraft can withstand the touch of Heav'n. Godf. Now Brother to the Trial! Eust. Impatience galls my Thought; on let us go, And hurl swift Vengeance on our impious Foe. They reascend the Mountain, while the Magician stands at his Cave Door, and sings, to encourage 'em. The Spirits, as before, present themselves in opposition, but upon the Touch of the Wands, vanish upward and downward, with terrible Noises and Confusion. They gain the Summit of the Hill and entring the Enchanted Arches, strike the Gate with their Wands; when immediatly the Palace, the Spirits, and the whole Mountain vanish away, and Godfrey and Eustatio are discover'd hanging on the sides of a vast Rock in the middle of the Sea; with much Difficulty they reach the Top, and descend on the other side. The Magicians Song. Fearless climb, illustrious Strangers, Facing Death, and scorning Dangers, Till your pious End you gain; Virtue guiding your Advances, Vain alas are all the Chances, Hell can form to give you Pain. As soon as the Magician sees the Enchantment ended, he goes into his Cave. Magician. O great and sure Effect of Virtue's Pow'r! Which no Designs can hurt, no Hell devour! SCENE III. The Enchanted Garden, Armida, Rinaldo, Almirena. Armida, holding a Dagger at Almirena's Breast. Arm. Die hated Rival, die! Alm. Oh pitying Heav'n! Rin. Let Mercy bid thee holdâ Arm. Mercy is mean; And Wrongs like mine blush in such base Society! The Asp-like Poyson of Revenge has stung me; And since for Her thou hast presum'd to slight me, Let Her by Me be robb'd of thy Possession; Love and Disdain require the Sacrifice. Rin. Complaints like mineâ Arm. But swell my Tide of Anger. Rin. Her Innocence might saveâ Arm. Her Beauty damns her! Rin. By the late Love you vow'dâ Arm. 'Tis chang'd to Scorn. Rin. First plunge your Dagger hereâ Arm. Let Grief do That. Rin. One Thunder Bolt good Heav'n! Arm. She shall rain Blood; Showers always follow Thunder. Armida lifts her Arm to Stab Almirena, and Rinaldo draws his Sword and is striking at her, when two Spirits rise to her assistance, and seize upon him. Rin. First let Thy Soul, perfidious Hag, be sent To make a Road for Hers! SCENE IV. Godfrey and Eustatio enter the Garden. Arm. Ha! Strangers here! and arm'd! presumptious Slaves, How have you dar'd with those unhallow'd Feet, To touch this sacred Ground? Rise, Furies, rise, Leave your grim King unguarded to attend me. A dreadful Host of Spirits rise and fill the Stage, but Godfrey and Eustatio putting out their Wands, the whole Prospect of the Garden vanishes in a moment; leaving in its Place the View of a wild and open Country, with the City of Jerusalem on that side which is built upon Rocks. A Highway is discover'd from the City Gate, which leads in several Turns and Windings down the Mountains. Godfrey, Eustatio, and Rinaldo run to embrace, and in the mean while Armida again attempts to Stab Almirena, Godf. Mighty Rinaldo! Rin. Prince more mighty, Hail! Eust. Let me embrace a Heart, thatâ Rin. Beats for Thee. Alm. O help me, help me! Rin. Darst thou yet presume Thus to assault my Hope? Revenge be mine! Rinaldo draws his Sword to wound Armida, who vanishes under the Stroke. Godf. My Daughter! Alm. Father! Eust. Dearest! Rin. Lovely Maid! Eust &amp; Rin. Begone ye Ills that did my Hopes invade; All four. Let Sorrows past, by Joys to come be paid Godf. Our Hellish Enemies thus bravely vanquish'd, An Earthly Foe, to vanquish yet remains! When, therefore, in yon Eastern Part of Heav'n, The glorious Sun shall rise to gild the World, Brother, take Care that all my Squadrons march, For proud Jerusalem this Day shall fall: And you Rinaldo! Stain'd with the Guilt of soft and untim'd Love, Strive with the Blood of our unfaithful Foe, To wash your Bosom to its native Snow. My Heart, o'erflow'd with Pleasure, Now Tasts a new Delight, And Joy beyond all Measure, Makes Hope it self more bright; How glorious will our Fortune be, Such mighty Labours past, To gather Fruit from Conquest's, Tree, And Feast our selves at last! [My &amp;c. Eust. What you command, with Pleasure I obey; Godf. and Eust. go out. Rin. Love, Glory, and Remorse conjointly spur me. A Fire betwixt two Winds Is my divided Heart, Glory on one Side binds, Love lends a thousand Minds, I'll act the bravest Part. A Fire, &amp;c. SCENE V. Argantes at the Hills Foot, follow'd by three Generals. Arg. Poorly confin'd within those narrow Walls, The tow'ring Valour of our warlike Troops, Blushes with noble Shame; but this great Day Know you, my trusty, and my valiant Chiefs, I will, that every Arm that strikes for me, Push for the Palm of final Victory. This Day, this glorious Day, the Foes of Asia, Shall feel her dreadful Valour in their Fate. SCENE VI. Enter Armida to Argantes. Arm. To aggravate thy Grief for my Disdain, Thus, with triumphant Joy, I face a Traitor. Arg. That haughty and insulting Air of thine, Has Pow'r to move no Passion but my Anger. Arm. My injur'd Love shall prove a Devil to damn thee Arg. 'Twill be a very harmless Devil! Arm. Ah no! 'Twill prove a Bosome Fury to torment thee. Arg. Woman begone. This is a Day of War, Thy Sex but serve to soften Men to Cowards. Arm. I have a manly Heart, unkind Argantes, And feel the Force of Glory, when Fame calls. Arg. Whate'er my coming Chance in War may be, In Love I must be conquer'd; say Armida, Canst thou forgive me? Arm. When I've try'd, I'll tell you. Arg. The Guilty Part is mine. Arm. 'Tis well you own it Arg. Love caus'd my Fault. Arm. I err'd a little too. Arg. Now I repent. Arm. I lov'd Rinaldo Sir, (Both together) Then let this dear Embrace Our mutual Guilt Efface. They embrace. Arg. Now let us join our Rage to meet the Foe. Arm. Lose we our Strifes of Love in Strifes of War; Arg. The very Heav'ns their Whirlwind Trumpets sound And call to Battel. Arm. On our side appear, The Earth, the Skies, Hell, and our Prophet's Pow'r. The Pagan Trumpets sound a March, and the Army is seen to pass the Gate, and in military Order descend the Mountain, at whose Foot they pay the usual Compliments of War, as they pass by, to Argantes and Armida. Arg. Yon Wood of Lances shall outgrow the Palms, Our haughty Foes reap'd in their hasty Conquests. Arm. Drown'd in a Sea of Blood their Fame shall sink. (Both together) To Triumph summon'd hence In Asia's just Defence, Give we this Day to Rage. That past, with Joy return, In softer Fires to burn, And in Love Fights engage. To &amp;c. SCENE VII. Enter Godfrey, Rinaldo and Almirena. Godf. The various Chances we so lately met, Mix Grief, and Joy, and Wonder in my Soul. Alm. Remembrance lies so heavy on my Thoughts, That I scarce know I wake, and walk in Freedom. Rin. The Tempest past, that frown'd upon our Love, Leaves us a Calm of Hope to Sail upon. Alm. The balmy Breezes of thy gentle Breath, Have lull'd me into Loves undoubting Slumber. Sweet the Blessing Of Carressing And Possessing, Faithful Love, and constant Pleasure; Joy enduring, Peace procuring, Bliss insuring Is a Lover's shining Treasure. SCENE VIII. Enter Eustatio. Eust. Arm, Arm, ye Princes! Now your Fortune calls ye The Pagan Host, with Shouts of barbarous Rage, Is marching down in dreadful Order on us! A fierce Desire of Glory fires our Troops, And only thy Command, illustrious Chief, Can bridle their impetuous Claim of Battel! Godf. Behold the longwish'd Crisis of our Fame! A Day that calls us out to Triumph ever! Rin. Behold! The Laurel which long since took Root, This glorious Day shoots high, and branches o'er us! Alm. Behold! How in those rayous Eyes of thine, Glory and Love with Kindred Lightning shine! Godf. To guard our Tents Eustatio, and our Rear, Be it thy noble Task; For there the Foe May pour a sudden and a dang'rous Force; Thy Courage and thy Conduct will prevent it, And whom shou'd I consign my Daughter to, But Thee, my Brother, and my well tried Friend? Take and protect my Almirena's Charms From the rough Touch of unrespecting War. Rin. To whose known Care but thine, experienc'd Warriour, Cou'd I resign the Safety of my Soul? Eust. Urg'd by my Friendship and my Duty join'd, I gladly take this weighty Charge upon me. This Day shall Sion change her King, And in her conquer'd Throne, See Virtue's Princely Blossom spring By pious Valour known; Thus noble Souls by Heav'n regarded, Are by Fortune's Smiles rewarded. This Day, &amp;c. He goes out with Almirena. SCENE IX. The Christian Trumpets sound, and the Army in Military Pomp and Order, marches over the Stage, saluting their General as they pass. Rin. You, mighty Prince, whose active Skill in War Delights to flourish in the Face of Death, And lead on thick wedg'd Files to open Battel; Will best secure the Int'rest of our Cause Heading the dreadful Squadrons to the Field; I, by an oblique Path, unseen, unfear'd, Will from the Eastern Foot of Sion's Wall Storm the unwary City's Battlements, So to compleat, at once, the Fall of Asia. Godf. Great, and a Task alone becoming Thee, Is the uncommon Enterprize thou nam'st; I prize thy Counsel, and to follow it, Thus take my Leave, impatient of Delay. (goes out. Rin. My Soul, refulgent midst the Beams of Hope, Shines out at either Eye with joyful Splendour! Now the Trumpet, Life inspiring, Calls me out in Honour's Cause, Love and War my Bosom firing, Give my Will divided Laws. SCENE X. Argantes marching in his Troops, and ranging them in Order of Battel. Arg. Be brave ye faithful Followers of my Fortune, Yon wearied Army of your hated Foe, Is but a marching Den of Thieves and Robbers, More famous far than dreadful to your Arms! Stoop, tow'ring Eagles on the frighted Prey Fate has prepar'd you; Fight, and fighting, conquer; Perish the Wretches that wou'd make you wretched, Be all their Rapines ravish'd from their Hold, And fall their Pow'r a Victim to Destruction. SCENE XI. Godfrey with the Christian Army. Godf. Behold the happy Day at last arriv'd, Ye valiant Champions for the Cause of Heav'n, Which is to put an End to all your Pains, And Crown your Labours with their wish'd Reward! Why are they met in such unnumber'd Ranks, But that their All may be at once o'erthrown, And one brave Battle give us many Vict'ries! Fight with your wonted Courage, and succeed, Their Strength will fail, confounded at your Bravery! The Armies attack each other and form a regular Battle, which hangs in Balance, till Rinaldo having Storm'd the City, descends the Mountain with his Squadron, and assaults the Pagans in the Rear, who immediately fly, and are pursued by Rinaldo. Godf. Where Fame inspires Our brave Desires, Conduct and Courage are the Pride of War; But Love alone Can Fame dethrone, And lighten Vict'ry's Beams by Beauties Star. Where, &amp;c. SCENE XII. Enter Rinaldo with Argantes in Chains. Rin. Behold! the haughty Pride of Asia's Hope, Has learnt to bow! Arg. Christian, Thou wrong'st my Fame. 'Tis true, Argantes is a Slave to War, But That Argantes has a Heart that's free, A Heart, that wou'd not stoop to Heav'n ignobly, A Heart, the Fates themselves can scarce controul! Godf. To thee Rinaldo is this Triumph due. SCENE XIII. Enter Eustatio, and Almirena, with Armida, Prisoner. Eust. See here the just Event of impious Rage! This cruel Amazon, while bent on Ruin, She sought to plunder and destroy our Tents, Fell in the Snares she fix'd for other's Mischief! Arg. Ye Pow'rs what do I see! Arm. Oh cruel Gods! Rin. Now Almirena we rejoyce, Alm. By thee. Godf. Now to the Marriage promis'd to your Hopes, Godf. &amp; Eust. Be Love and Glory equally propitious. Rin. &amp; Alm. Be Joy and Glory equally propitious. They Embrace. Arm. Their Valour cannot be more fam'd than ours, Their Gods are sure more pow'rful? Arg. Or their Fortunes. Rin. &amp; Alm. My share in all this Triumph rests in Thee. Arm. No! Heav'n perhaps has chose this Road to save me, And, willing I shou'd wash me from my Sins, Holds forth her sacred Waters! Be it so. Unworthy Instrument of all my Crimes, Thus I revenge me on thee. [breaks her enchanted Wand Arg. Nay Armida, Where'er you lead, Love and Argantes follow. Arm. to Godf. &amp;c. Conquer'd by you, we wou'd embrace Your Faith. Rin. Oh Smile of Heav'n! Alm. O! happy Chance of War. Eust. Chief of our Triumphs! Godf. You are henceforth free, Arg. Happy Armida! Arm. Come Argantes, come, Lov'd Partner of my Soul and of my Throne. Chorus. Here on Earth our Love inclines us To a thousand Crimes of Nature, But hereafter all refines us, To the Mould of our Creator. THE END.</field>
