      <field name="fulltext">THE PERSIANS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. When Xerxes came to the throne of Persia, remembering how his father Dareios had sought to subdue the land of the Hellenes, and seeking to avenge the defeat of Datis and Artaphernes on the field of Marathon, he gathered together a mighty host of all nations under his dominion, and led them against Hellas. And at first he prospered and prevailed, crossed the Hellespont, and defeated the Spartans at ThermopylÃ¦, and took the city of Athens, from which the greater part of its citizens had fled. But at last he and his armament met with utter overthrow at Salamis. Meanwhile Atossa, the mother of Xerxes, with her handmaids and the elders of the Persians, waited anxiously at Susa, where was the palace of the great king, for tidings of her son. Note.âWithin two years after the battle of Salamis, the feeling of national exultation was met by Phrynichos in a tragedy bearing the title of the PhÅnikians, and having for its subject the defeat of Xerxes. As he had come under the displeasure of the Athenian demos for having brought on the stage the sufferings of their Ionian kinsmen in his Capture of Miletos, he was apparently anxious to regain his popularity by a âsensationâ drama of another kind; and his success seems to have prompted Ãschylos to a like attempt five years later, B. C. 473. The Tetralogy to which the play belonged, and which gained the first prize on its representation, included the two tragedies (unconnected in subject) of Phineus and Glaucos, and the satyric drama of Prometheus the Firestealer. The play has, therefore, the interest of being strictly a contemporary narrative of the battle of Salamis and its immediate consequences, by one who may himself have been present at it, and whose brother Ameinias (Herod. viii. 93) had distinguished himself in it by a special act of heroism. As such, making all allowance for the influence of dramatic exigencies, and the tendency to colour history so as to meet the tastes of patriotic Athenians, it may claim, where it differs from the story told by Herodotos, to be a more trustworthy record. And it has, we must remember, the interest of being the only extant drama of its class, the only tragedy the subject of which is not taken from the cycle of heroic myths, but from the national history of the time. Far below the Oresteian Trilogy, as it may seem to us, as a work of art, having more the character of a spectacle than a poem, it was, we may well believe, unusually successful at the time, and it is said to have been chosen by Hiero for reproduction at Syracuse after Ãschylos had settled there under his patronage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦ Atossa. Messenger. Ghost of Dareios. Xerxes. Chorus of Persian Elders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE.âSusa, in front of the palace of Xerxes, the Tomb of Dareios occupying the position of the thymele. Enter Chorus of Persian Elders. We the title bear of Faithful, âThe Faithful,â or âtrusty,â seems to have been a special title of honour given to the veteran councillors of the king, (Xenoph. Anab. i. 15,) just as that of the âImmortalsâ was chosen for his body-guard, (Herod. vii. 83.) Friends of Persians gone to Hellas, Watchers left of treasure city Susa was pre-eminently the treasury of the Persian kings (Herod. v. 49; Strabo. xv. p. 731), their favourite residence in spring, as Ecbatana in Media was in summer and Babylon in winter. Gold-abounding, whom, as oldest, Xerxes hath himself appointed, He, the offspring of Dareios, As the warders of his country. And about our king's returning, And our army's, gold-abounding, Over-much, with evil boding, Does my mind within me shudder, (For our whole strength born of Asia Is gone,) and for our youthful ruler Sorely frets: nor courier cometh, Nor any horseman, bringing tidings To the city of the Persians. From Ecbatana departing, Or Susa, or the Kissian fortress, Kissia was properly the name of the district in which Susa stood; but here, and in v. 123, it is treated as if it belonged to a separate city. Throughout the play there is, indeed, a lavish use of Persian barbaric names of persons and places, without a very minute regard to historical accuracy. Forth they sped upon their journey, Some in ships, and some on horses, Some on foot, still onward marching, In their close array presenting Squadrons duly armed for battle: Then Amistres, Artaphernes, Megabazes, and Astaspes, Mighty leaders of the Persians, Kings, and of the great King servants, Here, as in Herodotos and Greek writers generally, the title, âthe King,â or âthe great King,â was enough. It could be understood only of the Persian. The latter name had been borne by the kings of Assyria. (2 Kings xviii. 28.) A little later it passed into the fuller, more boastful form of âthe King of kings.â March, the chiefs of mighty army. Archers they and mounted horsemen, Dread to look on, fierce in battle, Artembares, horse-controller, And Masistres, and ImÃ¦os, Archer famed, and Pharandakes, And the charioteer Sosthanes; Neilos mighty and prolific Sent forth others, Susiskanes, Pegastagon, born in Egypt, And the chief of sacred Memphis; Great Arsames, Ariomardos, Ruler of primeval ThebÃ¦, And the marshmen, The inhabitants of the Delta of the Nile, especially those of the marshy districts near the Heracleotic mouth, were famed as supplying the best and bravest soldiers of any part of Egypt.âComp. Thucyd. i. 110. and the rowers, Dread and in their number countless. And their fellow crowds of Lydians, Very delicate and stately, The epithet was applied probably by Ãschylos to the Lydians properly so called, the barbaric race with whom the Hellenes had little or nothing in common. They in dress, diet, mode of life, their distaste for the contents of the arena, seemed to the Greeks the very type of effeminacy. The Ionian Greeks, however, were brought under the same influence, and gradually acquired the same character. The suppression of the name of the Ionians in the list of the Persian forces, may be noticed as characteristic. The Athenian poet would not bring before an Athenian audience the shame of their Asiatic kinsmen. Who the people of the mainlands Rule throughout,âwhom Mitragathes And brave Arkteus, kingly chieftains, And Sardis, gold-abounding, send forth, Riding on their many chariots, Three or four a-breast their horses, Sight to look upon all dreadful! And the men of sacred Tmolos Tmolos, sacred as being the mythical birth-place of Dionysos. Rush to place the yoke of bondage On the neck of conquered Hellas. Mardon, Tharybis, spear-anvils, âSpear-anvils,â sc., meeting the spear of their foes as the anvils would meet it, turning its point, themselves steadfast and immovable. And the Mysians, javelin-darting, So Herodotos (vii. 74) in his account of the army of Xerxes describes the Mysians as using for their weapons those darts or âjavelinsâ made by hardening the ends in the fire. BabylÃ´n too, gold-abounding, Sends a mingled crowd, swept onward, Both the troops who man the vessels, And the skilled and trustful archers; And the race the sword that beareth, Follows from each clime of Asia, At the great King's dread commandment. These, the bloom of Persia's greatness, Now are gone forth to the battle; And for these, their mother country, Asia, mourns with mighty yearning; Wives and mothers faint with trembling Through the hours that slowly linger, Counting each day as it passes. Stroph. I. The king's great host, destroying cities mighty, Hath to the land beyond the sea passed over, Crossing the straits of Athamantid Helle, Helle the daughter of Athamas, from whom the Hellespont took its name. For the description of the pontoons formed by boats, which were moored together with cables and finally covered with faggots, comp. Herod. vii. 36. On raft by ropes secured, And thrown his path, compact of many a vessel, As yoke upon the neck of mighty ocean. Antistroph. I. Of populous Asia thus the mighty ruler 'Gainst all the land his sacred host directeth In two divisions, land and naval forces, Trusting the chieftains stern, The men who drive the host to fight, relentless,â He, sprung from gold-born race, a hero godlike, âGold-born,â sc., descended from Perseus, the child of DanaÃ«. Stroph. II. And glancing with darkling look, and eyes as of ravening dragon, With many a hand, and many a ship, and driving his Syrian chariot, Syrian, either in the vague sense in which it became almost synonymous with Assyrian, or else showing that Syria, properly so called, retained the fame for chariots which it had had at a period as early as the time of the Herbrew Judges, (Judg. v. 3.) Herodotos (vii. 140) gives an Oracle of Delphi in which the same epithet appears. He brings upon spearmen renowned the battle of conquering arrows. The description, though put into the mouth of Persians, is meant to flatter Hellenic pride. The Persians and their army were for the most part light-armed troops only, barbarians equipped with javelins or bows. In the sculptures of Persepolis, as in those of Nineveh and Khorsabad, this mode of warfare is throughout the most conspicuous. They, the Hellenes, were the hoplites, warriors of the spear and the shield, the cuirass and the greaves. Antistroph. II. Nor is there one so tried as, withstanding the great flood of warriors, To keep within stedfast bounds that wave of ocean resistless; Hard to fight is the host of the Persians, the people stout-hearted. Mesode. Yet ah! what mortal can ward the craft of the Gods all-deceiving? Who with a nimble foot of one leap is easily sovereign? For AtÃ©, fawning and kind, at first a mortal betraying, Then in snares and meshes decoys him, Whence one who is but man is vain doth struggle to 'scape from. Stroph. III. For Fate of old, by the high Gods' decree, Prevailed, and on the Persians brought this task, Wars with the crash of towers, And set the surge of horsemen in array, And the fierce sack that lays a city low. Antistroph. III. But now they learnt to look on ocean plains, A touch of Athenian exultation in their life as seamen. To them the sea was almost a home. They were familiar with it from childhood. To the Persians it was new and untried. They had a new lesson to learn, late in the history of the nation, late in the lives of individual soldiers. The wide sea hoary with the violent blast, Waxing o'er confident In cables formed of many a slender strand, And rare device of transport for the host. Stroph. IV. So doth my toiling soul, As clad in mourning, mutter in its fear, Ah me! ah me! for all the Persian host! Lest soon our country learn That Susa's spacious fort is void of men. Antistroph. IV. And through the Kissians' town Shall echo heavy thud of hands on breast. Woe! woe! when all the crowd of women speak This utterance of great grief, And byssine robes are rent in agony. Stroph. V. For all the horsemen strong, And host that march on foot, Like swarm of bees, have gone with him who led The vanguard of the host, Crossing the sea-washed, bridge-built promontory That joins the shores of either continent. The bridge of boats, with the embankment raised upon it, is thought of as a new headland putting out from the one shore and reaching to the other. Antistroph. V. And beds with tears are wet In grief for husbands gone, And Persian wives are lavish in their grief, Each yearning for her lord; And each who sent her warrior-spouse to battle Now mourns at home in dreary solitude. But come, ye Persians now, And sitting in this ancient hall of ours, Let us take thought deep-counselling and wise, (Sore need is there of that,) How fareth now the great king Xerxes, he Who calls Dareios sire, Bearing the name our fathers bore of old? Is it the archer's bow that wins the day? Or does the strength prevail Of iron point that heads the spear's strong shaft? But lo! in glory like the face of gods, The mother of my king, my queen, appears, Let us do reverent homage at her feet; Yea, it is meet that all Should speak to her with words of salutation. Enter Atossa in a chariot of state. O sovereign queen of Persian wives deep-zoned, Mother of Xerxes, old and venerable, Wife of Dareios! hail! 'Twas thine to join in wedlock with a spouse Whom Persians owned as God, Stress is laid by the Hellenic poet, as in the Agamemnon, (v. 895,) and in v. 707 of this Play, on the tendency of the East to give to its kings the names and the signs of homage which were due only to the Gods. The Hellenes might deify a dead hero, but not a living sovereign. On different grounds the Jews shrank, as in the stories of Nebuchadnezzar and Dareios, (Dan. iii. 6,) from all such acts. And of a God thou art the mother too, Unless its ancient Fortune fails our host. Atoss. Yes, thus I come, our gold-decked palace leaving, The bridal bower Dareios with me slept in. Care gnaws my heart, but now I tell you plainly A tale, my friends, which may not leave me fearless, Lest boastful wealth should stumble at the threshold, And with his foot o'erturn the prosperous fortune That great Dareios raised with Heaven's high blessing. And twofold care untold my bosom haunteth: We may not honour wealth that has no warriors, Nor on the poor shines light to strength proportioned; Wealth without stint we have, yet for our eye we tremble; For as the eye of home I deem a master's presence. Wherefore, ye Persians, aid me now in counsel; Trusty and old, in you lies hope of wisdom. Chor. Queen of our land! be sure thou need'st not utter Or thing or word twice o'er, which power may point to; Thou bid'st us counsel give who now are willing. Atoss. Ever with many visions of the night In the Greek, as in the translation, there is a change of metre, intended apparently to represent the transition from the tone of eager excitement to the ordinary level of discourse. Am I encompassed, since my son went forth, Leading a mighty host, with aim to sack The land of the Ionians. But ne'er yet Have I beheld a dream so manifest As in the night just past. And this I'll tell thee: There stood by me two women in fair robes; And this in Persian garments was arrayed, And that in Dorian came before mine eyes; In stature both of tallest, comeliest size; And both of faultless beauty, sisters twain Of the same stock. With reference either to the mythos that Asia and Europe were both daughters of Okeanos, or to the historical fact that the Asiatic Ionians and the Dorians of Europe were both of the same Hellenic stock. The contrast between the long flowing robes of the Asiatic women, and the short, scanty kilt-like dress of those of Sparta must be borne in mind if we would see the picture in its completeness. And they twain had their homes, One in the Hellenic, one in alien land. And these two, as I dreamt I saw, were set At variance with each other. And my son Learnt it, and checked and mollified their wrath, And yokes them to his chariots, and his collar He places on their necks. And one was proud Of that equipment, Athenian pride is flattered with the thought that they had resisted while the Ionian Greeks had submitted all too willingly to the yoke of the Barbarian. and in harness gave Her mouth obedient, but the other kicked, And tears the chariot's trappings with her hands, And rushes off uncurbed, and breaks its yoke Asunder. And my son falls low, and then His father comes, Dareios, pitying him. And lo! when Xerxes sees him, he his clothes Rends round his limbs. These things I say I saw In visions of the night; and when I rose, And dipped my hands in fountain flowing clear, Lustrations of this kind, besides their general significance in cleansing from defilement, had a special force as charms to turn aside dangers threatened by foreboding dreams.âComp. Aristoph. Frogs, v. 1264; Persius, Sat. ii. 16. I at the altar stood with hand that bore Sweet incense, wishing holy chrism to pour To the averting Gods whom thus men worship. And I beheld an eagle in full flight To PhÅbos' altar-hearth; and then, my friends, I stood, struck dumb with fear; and next I saw A kite pursuing, in her wingÃ¨d course, And with his claws tearing the eagle's head, Which did nought else but crouch and yield itself. Such terrors it has been my lot to see, And yours to hear: For be ye sure, my son, If he succeed, will wonder-worthy prove; But if he fail, still irresponsible He to the people, and in either case, He, should he but return, is sovereign still. The political bearing of the passage as contrasting this characteristic of the despotism of Persia with the strict account to which all Athenian generals were subject, is, of course, unmistakable. Chor. We neither wish, O Lady, thee to frighten O'ermuch with what we say, nor yet encourage: But thou, the Gods adoring with entreaties, If thou hast seen aught ill, bid them avert it, And that all good things may receive fulfilment For thee, thy children, and thy friends and country. And next 'tis meet libations due to offer To Earth and to the dead. And ask thy husband, Dareios, whom thou say'st by night thou sawest, With kindly mood from 'neath the Earth to send thee Good things to light for thee and for thine offspring, While adverse things shall fade away in darkness. Such things do I, a self-taught seer, advise thee In kindly mood, and any way we reckon That good will come to thee from out these omens. Atoss. Well, with kind heart, as first expounder, thou Of these my dreams hast brought out welcome meaning For me, and for my sons; and thy good news, May it receive fulfilment! And this too, As thou dost bid, we to the Gods will offer, And to our friends below, when we go homeward. But first, my friends, I wish to hear of Athens, Where in the world do men report it standeth? The question, which seems to have rankled in the minds of the Athenians, is recorded as an historical fact, and put into the mouth of Dareios by Herodotos, (v. 101.) He had asked it on hearing that Sardis had been attacked and burnt by them. Chor. Far to the West, where sets our king the Sun-God. Atoss. Was it this city my son wished to capture? Chor. Aye, then would Hellas to our king be subject. Atoss. And have they any multitude of soldiers? Chor. A mighty host, that wrought the Medes much mischief. Atoss. And what besides? Have they too wealth sufficing? Chor. A fount of silver have they, their soil's treasure. The words point to the silver mines at Laureion, which had been worked under Peisistratos, and of which this is the first mention in Greek literature. Atoss. Have they a host in archers' skill excelling? Chor. Not so, they wield the pike and shield and bucklers. Once more the contrast between the Greek hoplite and the light-armed archers of the invaders, is dwelt upon. The next answer of the Chorus dwells upon the deeper contrast, then prominent in the minds of all Athenians, between their democratic freedom and the despotism of Persia. Atoss. What shepherd rules and lords it o'er their people? Chor. They are not slaves of any man, nor subjects. Atoss. How then can they sustain a foe invading? Chor. So that they spoiled Dareios' goodly army. Atoss. Dread news is thine for sires of those who 're marching. Chor. Nay, but I think thou soon wilt know the whole truth; This running one may know is that of Persian: The system of postal communications by means of couriers which Dareios had organised had made their speed in running proverbial, (Herod. viii. 97.) 'Tis clear he brings some good or evil tidings. Enter Messenger. Mess. O cities of the whole wide land of Asia! O soil of Persia, haven of great wealth! How at one stroke is brought to nothingness Our great prosperity, and all the flower Of Persia's strength is fallen! Woe is me! 'Tis ill to be the first to bring ill news; Yet needs must I the whole woe tell, ye Persians; All our barbaric mighty host is lost. With the characteristic contempt of a Greek for other races, Ãschylos makes the Persians speak of themselves throughout as âbarbarians,â âbarbaric.â Stroph. I. Chor. O piteous, piteous woe! O strange and dread event! Weep, O ye Persians, hearing this great grief! Mess. Yea, all things there are ruined utterly; And I myself beyond all hope behold The light of day at home. Antistroph. I. Chor. Long, long doth life appear To me, bowed down with years, On hearing this unlooked-for misery. Mess. And I, indeed, being present and not hearing The tales of others, can report, ye Persians, What ills were brought to pass. Stroph. II. Chor. Alas, alas! in vain The many-weaponed and commingled host Went from the land of Asia to invade The soil divine of Hellas. Mess. Full of the dead, slain foully, are the coasts Of Salamis, and all the neighbouring shore. Antistroph. II. Chor. Alas, alas! sea-tossed The bodies of our friends, and much disstained: Thou say'st that they are drifted to and fro In far out-floating robes. Perhaps, âOn decks that floated on.â Mess. E'en so; our bows availed not, but the host Has perished, conquered by assault at sea. Stroph. III. Chor. Wail, raise a bitter cry And full of woe, for those who died in fight. How every way the Gods have wrought out ill, Ah me! ah me! our army all destroyed! Mess. O name of Salamis that most I loathe! Ah how I groan, remembering Athens too! Antistroph. III. Chor. Yea, to her enemies Athens may well be hateful, and our minds Remember how full many a Persian wife She, for no cause, made widows and bereaved. Atoss. Long time I have been silent in my woe, Crushed down with grief; for this calamity Exceeds all power to tell the woe, or ask. Yet still we mortals needs must bear the grief The Gods send on us. Clearly tell thy tale, Unfolding the whole mischief, even though Thou groan'st at evils, who there is not dead, And which of our chief captains we must mourn, And who, being set in office o'er the host, Left by their death that office desolate. Mess. Xerxes still lives and sees the light of day. Atoss. To my house, then, great light thy words have brought, Bright dawn of morning after murky night. Mess. Artembares, the lord of myriad horse, On the hard flinty coasts of the Sileni Is now being dashed; and valiant Dadakes Captain of thousands, smitten with the spear, Leapt wildly from his ship. And Tenagon, Best of the true old Bactrians, haunts the soil Of Aias' isle; Lilaios, Arsames, And with them too Argestes, there defeated, Hard by the island where the doves abound, Possibly Salamis itself, as famed for the doves which were reared there as sacred to Aphrodite, but possibly also one of the smaller islands in the Saronic gulf, which the epithet would be enough to designate for an Athenian audience. Beat here and there upon the rocky shore. [And from the springs of Neilos, Ãgypt's stream, Arkteus, Adeues, Pheresseues too, These with Pharnuchos in one ship were lost;] Matallos, Chrysa-born, the captain bold Of myriads, leader he of swarthy horse Some thirty thousand strong, has fallen low, His red beard, hanging all its shaggy length, Deep dyed with blood, and purpled all his skin. Arabian Magos, Bactrian Artames, They perished, settlers in a land full rough. [Amistris and Amphistreus, guiding well The spear of many a conflict, and the noble Ariomardos, giving cause of woe At Sardis; and the Mysian Seisames.] With seven score ships and ten came Tharybis; LyrnÃ¦an he in birth, once fair in form, He lies, poor wretch, a death inglorious dying: And, first in valour proved, Syennesis, Kilikian Satrap, who, as one man, gave Most trouble to his foes, and nobly died. Of leaders such as these I mention make, And out of many evils tell but few. Atoss. Woe, woe! I hear the very worst of ills, Shame to the Persians, cause of bitter wail; But tell me, going o'er the ground again, How great the number of the Hellenes' navy, That they presumed with Persia's armament To wage their warfare in the clash of ships. Mess. As far as numbers went, be sure, the ships Of Persia had the better, for the Hellenes Had as their total ships but fifteen score, And other ten selected as reserve. And Xerxes (well I know it) had a thousand Which he commandedâthose that most excelled As regards the number of the Persian ships, 1000 of average, and 207 of special swiftness, Ãschylos agrees with Herodotos, who gives the total of 1207. The latter, however, reckons the Greek ships not at 310, but 378, (vii. 89.) In speed were twice five score and seven in number; So stands the account. Deem'st thou our forces less In that encounter? Nay, some Power above Destroyed our host, and pressed the balance down With most unequal fortune, and the Gods Preserve the city of the Goddess Pallas. Atoss. Is the Athenians' city then unsacked? Mess. Their men are left, and that is bulwark strong. The fact that Athens had actually been taken, and its chief buildings plundered and laid waste, was, of course, not a pleasant one for the poet to dwell on. It could hardly, however, be entirely passed over, and this is the one allusion to it. In the truest sense it was still âunsacked:â it had not lost its most effective defence, its most precious treasure. Atoss. Next tell me how the fight by sea began. Who led the attack? Were those Hellenes the first, Or was my son, exulting in his strength? Mess. The author of the mischief, O my mistress, Was some foul fiend or Power on evil bent; For lo! a Hellene from the Athenian host As the story is told by Herodotos, (viii. 75,) this was Sikinnos, the slave of Themistocles, and the stratagem was the device of that commander to save the Greeks from the disgrace and ruin of a sauve qui peut fight in all directions. Came to thy son, to Xerxes, and spake thus, That should the shadow of the dark night come, The Hellenes would not wait him, but would leap Into their rowers' benches, here and there, And save their lives in secret, hasty flight. And he forthwith, this hearing, knowing not The Hellene's guile, nor yet the Gods' great envy, Gives this command to all his admirals, Soon as the sun should cease to burn the earth With his bright rays, and darkness thick invade The firmament of Heaven, to set their ships In three-fold lines, to hinder all escape, And guard the billowy straits, and others place In circuit round about the isle of Aias: For if the Hellenes 'scaped an evil doom, And found a way of secret, hasty flight, It was ordained that all should lose their heads. The Greeks never beheaded their criminals, and the punishment is mentioned as being specially characteristic of the barbaric Persians. Such things he spake from soul o'erwrought with pride, For he knew not what fate the Gods would send; And they, in no disorder, but obeying, Then made their supper ready, and each sailor Fastened his oar around true-fitting thole; And when the sunlight vanished, and the night Had come, then each man, master of an oar, Went to his ship, and all men bearing arms, And rank encouraged rank in vessel long; And so they sail, as 'twas appointed each, And all night long the captains of the fleet Kept their men working, rowing to and fro; Night then came on, and the Hellenic host In no wise sought to take to secret flight, And when day, bright to look on with white steeds, O'erspread the earth, then rose from the Hellenes Loud chant of cry of battle, and forthwith Echo gave answer from each island rock; And terror then on all the Persians fell, Of fond hopes disappointed. Not in flight The Hellenes then their solemn pÃ¦ans sang: But with brave spirit hasting on to battle, With martial sound the trumpet fired those ranks: And straight with sweep of oars that flew through foam, They smote the loud waves at the boatswain's call; And swiftly all were manifest to sight. Then first their right wing moved in order meet; The Ãginetans and Megarians, according to the account preserved by Diodoros, (xi. 18,) or the LacedÃ¦monians, according to Herodotos, (viii. 65.) Next the whole line its forward course began, And all at once we heard a mighty shout,â âO sons of Hellenes, forward, free your country; Free too your wives, your children, and the shrines Built to your fathers' Gods, and holy tombs Your ancestors now rest in. Now the fight Is for our all.â And on our side indeed Arose in answer din of Persian speech, And time to wait was over: ship on ship Dashed its bronze-pointed beak, and first a barque Of Hellas did the encounter fierce begin, This may be meant to refer to the achievements of Ameinias of Pallene, who appears in the traditional life of Ãschylos as his youngest brother. And from PhÅnikian vessel crashes off Her carved prow. And each against his neighbour Steers his own ship: and first the mighty flood Of Persian host held out. But when the ships Were crowded in the straits, Sc. as in Herod. viii. 60, the strait between Salamis and the mainland. nor could they give Help to each other, they with mutual shocks, With beaks of bronze went crushing each the other, Shivering their rowers' benches. And the ships Of Hellas, with manÅuvring not unskilful, Charged circling round them. And the hulls of ships Floated capsized, nor could the sea be seen, Filled, as it was, with wrecks and carcases; And all the shores and rocks were full of corpses. And every ship was wildly rowed in fight, All that composed the Persian armament. And they, as men spear tunnies, Tunny-fishing has always been prominent in the occupations of the Mediterranean coasts, and the sailors who formed so large a part of every Athenian audience would be familiar with the process here described, of striking or harpooning them. Aristophanes (Wasps, 1087) coins (or uses) the word âto tunny,â (???????), to express the act. Comp. Herod. i. 62. or a haul Of other fishes, with the shafts of oars, Or spars of wrecks went smiting, cleaving down; And bitter groans and wailings overspread The wide sea-waves, till eye of swarthy night Bade it all cease: and for the mass of ills, Not, though my tale should run for ten full days, Could I in full recount them. Be assured That never yet so great a multitude Died in a single day as died in this. Atoss. Ah, me! Ah, me! Great then the sea of troubles That bursts on Persia and on Asia's hosts. Mess. Be sure our evil fate is but half o'er: On this has supervened such bulk of woe, As more than twice to outweigh what I tell. Atoss. And yet what fortune could be worse than this? Say, what is this disaster which thou tell'st That turns the scale to greater evils still? Mess. Those Persians that were in the bloom of life, Bravest in heart and noblest in their blood, And by the king himself deemed worthiest trust, Basely and by most shameful death have died. Atoss. Ah! woe is me, my friends, for our ill fate! What was the death by which thou say'st they died? Mess. There is an isle that lies off Salamis, Sc., Psyttaleia, lying between Salamis and the mainland. Pausanias (i. 36â82) describes it in his time as having no artistic shrine or statue, but full everywhere of roughly-carved images of Pan, to whom the island was sacred. It lay just opposite the entrance to the PeirÃ¦os. The connexion of Pan with Salamis and its adjacent islands seems implied in Sophocles, Aias. 695. Small, with bad anchorage for ships, where Pan, Pan the dance-loving, haunts the sea-washed coast. There Xerxes sends these men, that when their foes, Being wrecked, should to the islands safely swim, They might with ease destroy th'Hellenic host, And save their friends from out the deep sea's paths; But ill the future guessing: for when God Gave the Hellenes the glory of the battle, In that same hour, with arms well wrought in bronze, Shielding their bodies, from their ships they leapt, And the whole isle encircled, so that we Were sore distressed, The manÅuvre was, we learn from Herodotos (viii. 95), the work of Aristeides, the personal friend of Ãschylos, and the statesman with whose policy he had most sympathy. and knew not where to turn; For here men's hands hurled many a stone at them; And there the arrows from the archer's bow Smote and destroyed them; and with one great rush, At last advancing, they upon them dash And smite, and hew the limbs of these poor wretches, Till they their foes had utterly destroyed. [And Xerxes when he saw how deep the ill, The lines are noted as probably a spurious addition, by a weaker hand, to the text, as introducing surplusage, as inconsistent with Herodotos, and as faulty in their metrical structure. Groaned out aloud, for he had ta'en his seat, With clear, wide view of all the army round, On a high cliff hard by the open sea; And tearing then his robes with bitter cry, And giving orders to his troops on shore, He sends them off in foul retreat. This grief 'Tis thine to mourn besides the former ills.] Atossa. O hateful Power, how thou of all their hopes Hast robbed the Persians! Bitter doom my son Devised for glorious Athens, nor did they, The invading host who fell at Marathon, Suffice; but my son, counting it his task To exact requital for it, brought on him So great a crowd of sorrows. But I pray, As to those ships that have this fate escaped, Where did'st thou leave them? Can'st thou clearly tell? Mess. The captains of the vessels that were left, With a fair wind, but not in meet array, Took flight: and all the remnant of the army Fell in BÅotiaâsome for stress of thirst About the fountain clear, and some of us, Panting for breath, cross to the Phokians' land, The soil of Doris, and the Melian gulf, Where fair Spercheios waters all the plains With kindly flood, and then the AchÃ¦an fields And city of the Thessali received us, Famished for lack of food; So Herodotos (viii. 115) describes them as driven by hunger to eat even grass and leaves. and many died Of thirst and hunger, for both ills we bore; And then to the Magnetian land we came, And that of Macedonians, to the stream Of Axios, and Bolbe's reed-grown marsh, And Mount Pangaios and the Edonian land. And on that night God sent a mighty frost, Unwonted at that season, sealing up The whole course of the Strymon's sacred flood; No trace of this passage over the frozen Strymon appears in Herodotos, who leaves the reader to imagine that it was crossed, as before, by a bridge. It is hardly, indeed, consistent with dramatic probability that the courier should have remained to watch the whole retreat of the defeated army; and on this and other grounds, the latter part of the speech has been rejected by some critics as a later addition. And he who erst had deemed the Gods as nought, Then prayed with hot entreaties, worshipping Both earth and heaven. And after that the host Ceased from its frequent calling on the Gods, It crosses o'er the glassy, frozen stream; And whosoe'er set forth before the rays Of the bright God were shed abroad, was saved; For soon the glorious sun with burning blaze Reached the mid-stream and warmed it with its flame, And they, confused, each on the other fell. Blest then was he whose soul most speedily Breathed out its last. And those who yet survived And gained deliverance, crossing with great toil And many a pang through ThrakÃ¨, now are come, Escaped from perils, no great number they, To this our sacred land, and so it groans, This city of the Persians, missing much Our country's dear-loved youth. Too true my tale, And many things I from my speech omit, Ills which the Persians suffer at God's hand. Chor. O Power resistless, how o'erwhelmingly On all the Persian race have thy feet leapt! Atoss. Ah! woe is me for that our army lost! Oh, vision of the night that cam'st in dreams! Too clearly did'st thou shew me of these ills. But ye (to Chorus) did judge them far too carelessly; Yet since your counsel pointed to that course, I to the Gods will first my prayer address. And then with gifts to Earth and to the dead, Bringing the chrism from my store, I'll come. For our past ills, I know, 'tis all too late, But for the future, I may hope, will dawn A better fortune! But 'tis now your part In these our present ills, in counsel faithful To commune with the Faithful; and my son, Should he come here before me, comfort him, And home escort him, lest he add fresh ill To all these evils that we suffer now. [Exit. Chor. O Zeus our king, who now to nothing Hast brought the army of the Persians, Multitudinous, greatly boasting; And with gloomy woe hast shrouded Both Ecbatana and Susa; Many maidens now are tearing With their tender hands their mantles, Wet with drenching tears their bosoms, In the common grief partaking; And the brides of Persian warriors, Dainty even in their wailing, Longing for their new-wed husbands, Reft of bridal couch luxurious, With its coverlet so dainty, Losing joy of wanton youth-time, Mourn in never-sated wailings. And I too in fullest measure Raise again the cry of sorrow, Weeping for the loved and lost ones. Stroph. I. For now the land of Asia mourneth sore, Left desolate of men, 'Twas Xerxes led them forth, woe! woe! 'Twas Xerxes lost them all, woe! woe! 'Twas Xerxes who with evil counsels sped Their course in sea-borne barques. Why was Dareios erst so free from harm, First bowman of the state, The leader whom the men of Susa loved; Antistroph. I. While those who fought as soldiers or at sea, These ships, dark-hulled, well-rowed, Their own ships bore them on, woe! woe! Their own ships lost them all, woe! woe! Their own ships, in disastrous onset urged, And by Ionian hands? The Ionians, not of the Asiatic Ionia, but of Attica. The king himself, we hear, but hardly 'scapes Through ThrakÃ¨'s wide-spread steppes, And paths o'er which the tempests wildly sweep. Stroph. II. And they who perished first, ah me! Perforce unburied left, alas! Are scattered round Kychreia's shore, Kychreia, the archaic name of Salamis. woe! woe! Lament, mourn sore, and raise a bitter cry, Grievous, the sky to pierce, woe! woe! And let thy mourning voice uplift its strain Of loud and full lament. Antistroph. II. Torn by the whirling flood, ah me! Their carcases are gnawed, alas! By the dumb brood of the pure sea, woe! woe! And each house mourneth for its vanished lord; And childless sires, woe! woe! Mourning in age o'er griefs the Gods have sent, Now hear their utter loss. Stroph. III. And throughout all Asia's borders None now own the sway of Persia, Nor bring they any more their tribute, Owning sway of sovereign master. Now low upon the Earth, laid prostrate, Is the strength of our great monarch. Antistroph. III. No more need men keep in silence Tongues fast bound: for now the people May with freedom speak at pleasure; For the yoke of power is broken; And blood-stained in all its meadows The sea-washed isle of Aias holdeth What was once the Persian army. Re-enter Atossa. Atoss. Whoe'er, my friends, is vexed in troublous times, Knows that when once a tide of woe sets in, A man is wont to fear in everything; But when Fate flows on smoothly, then to trust That the same Fate will ever send fair gales. So now all these disasters from the Gods Seem in mine eyes filled full of fear and dread, And in mine ears rings cry unjubilant, So great a dread of all has seized my soul: And therefore now, without or chariot's state Or former pomp, have I thus issued forth From out my palace, to my son's sire bringing Libations loving, gifts propitiatory, Meet for the dead; milk pure and white from cow Unblemished, and bright honey that distils From the flower-working bee, and water drawn From virgin fountain, and the draught unstained From a wild mother, fruit of ancient vine; And here too of the tree that evermore Keeps its fresh life in foliage, the pale olive, Is the sweet-smelling fruit, and twinÃ¨d wreaths Of flowers, the children of all-fertile Earth. The ritual described is Hellenic rather than Persian, and takes its place (Soph. Electr. 836; Eurip. Iphig. Taur. 583; Homer, Il. xxiii. 219), as showing what offerings were employed to soothe or call up the spirits of the dead. Comp. Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxx. But ye, my friends, o'er these libations poured In honour of the dead, chant forth your hymns, And call upon Dareios as a God: While I will send unto the Gods below These votive offerings which the earth shall drink. [Goes to the tomb of Dareios in the centre of the stage. Chor. O royal lady, honoured of the Persians, Do thou libations pour To the dark chambers of the dead below; And we with hymns will pray The Powers that act as escorts of the dead To give us kindly help beneath the earth. But oh, ye holy Ones in darkness dwelling, Hermes and Earth, and thou, the Lord of Hell, Send from beneath a soul Up to the light of earth; For should he know a cure for these our ills, He, he alone of men, may tell the end. Stroph. I. Doth he, the blest one, hear, The king, like Gods in power, Hear me, as I send forth My cries in barbarous speech, Yet very clear to him,â Sad, varied, broken cries So as to tell aloud Our troubles terrible? Ah, does he hear below? Antistroph. I. But thou, O Earth, and ye, The other Lords of those Beneath the grave that dwell; Grant that the godlike one May come from out your home, The Persians' mighty God, In Susa's palace born; Send him, I pray you, up, The like of whom the soil Of Persia never hid. Stroph. II. Dear was our chief, and dear to us his tomb, For dear the life it hides; Aidoneus, O Aidoneus, send him forth, Thou who dost lead the dead to Earth again, Yea, send Dareios, even as he was! Antistroph. II. For never did he in war's bloody woe Lose all his warrior-host, But Heaven-taught Counsellor the Persians called him, And Heaven-taught Counsellor in truth he proved, Since he still ruled his host of subjects well. Stroph. III. Monarch, O ancient monarch, come, oh, come, Come to the summit of sepulchral mound, Lifting thy foot encased In slipper saffron-dyed, And giving to our view Thy royal tiara's crest: The description obviously gives the state dress of the Persian kings. They alone wore the tiara erect.âXen. Kyrop. viii. 3, 13. Speak, O Dareios, faultless father, speak. Antistroph. III. Yea, come, that thou, O Lord, may'st hear the woes, Woes new and strange, our lord has now endured; For on us now has fallen A dark and Stygian mist, Since all the armed youth Has perished utterly; Speak, O Dareios, faultless father, speak. Epode. O thou, whose death thy friends Bewail with many tears, Why thus, O Lord of lords, In double error of wild frenzy born, Have all our triremes good Been lost to this our land, Ships that are ships no more, yea, ships no more? The Ghost of Dareios appears on the summit of the mound. Dar. O faithful of the Faithful, ye who were Companions of my youth, ye Persian elders, What troubles is't my country toils beneath? The whole plain groans, cut up and furrowed o'er, Either that he has heard the measured tread of the mourners round his tomb, as they went wailing round and round, or that he has heard the rush of armies, and seen the plain tracked by chariot-wheels, and comes, not knowing all things, to learn what it means. And I, beholding now my queen beloved Standing hard by my sepulchre, feared much, And her libations graciously received; But ye wail loud near this my sepulchre, And shouting shrill with cries that raise the dead Ye call me with your plaints. No easy task Is it to come, for this cause above all, That the great Gods who reign below are apter To seize men than release: yet natheless I, Being great in power among them, now am come. Be quick then, that none blame me as too late; The words point to the wide-spread belief that when the souls of the dead were permitted to return to earth, it was with strict limitations as to the time of their leave of absence. What new dire evils on the Persians weigh? Chor. I fear to look on thee, Fear before thee to speak, With all the awe of thee I felt of old. Dar. But since I came by thy complaints persuaded, From below rising, spin no lengthened tale; But shortly, clearly speak, and tell thy story, And leave awhile thine awe and dread of me. Chor. I dread thy wish to grant, I dread to say thee nay, Perhapsâ âI dread to speak the truth.â Saying things that it is hard for friends to speak. Dar. Nay then, since that old dread of thine prevents thee, Do thou [to Atossa] the ancient partner of my bed, My noble queen, from these thy plaints and moanings Cease, and say something clearly. Human sorrows May well on mortals fall; for many evils, Some on the sea, and some on dry land also, Happen to men if life be far prolonged. Atoss. O thou, who in the fate of fair good fortune Excelled'st all men, who, while yet thou sawest The sun's bright rays, did'st lead a life all blessed, Admired, yea, worshipped as a God by Persians, Now, too, I count thee blest in that thou died'st Before thou saw'st the depth of these our evils. For now, Dareios, thou shalt hear a tale Full, yet in briefest moment. In a word, The Persians' state is ruined utterly. Dar. How so? Hath plague or discord seized my country? Atoss. Not so, but all the host is lost at Athens. Dar. What son of mine led that host thither, tell me? According to Herodotos (vii. 225) two brothers of Xerxes fell at ThermopylÃ¦. Atoss. Xerxes the mighty, emptying all the mainland. Dar. Made he this mad attempt by land or sea? Atoss. By both; two lines there were of two great armies. Dar. How did so great a host effect its passage? Atoss. He bridged the straits of Helle, and found transit. Dar. Did he prevail to close the mighty Bosporos? Atoss. So was it; yet some God, it may be, helped him. Dar. Alas! some great God came and stole his wisdom. Atoss. Yea, the end shows what evil he accomplished. Dar. And how have they fared, that ye thus bewail them? Atoss. The naval host, o'ercome, destroyed the army. Dar. What! is the whole host by the spear laid low? Atoss. For this doth Susa's city mourn her losses. Dar. Alas, for that brave force and mighty army! Atoss. The Bactrians all are lost, not old men merely. Dar. Poor fool! how he hath lost the flower of forces! Atoss. Xerxes, they say, alone, with but few others. ... Dar. What is his end, and where? Is there no safety? Atoss. Is glad to gain the bridge that joins two mainlands. Dar. And has he reached this mainland? Is that known well? Atoss. Yea, the report holds good. Here is no discord. As Herodotos (viii. 117) tells the story, the bridge had been broken by tempest before Xerxes reached it. Dar. Ah me! Full swift the Oracles' fulfilment! And on my son hath Zeus their end directed. I hoped the Gods would work them out more slowly; But when man hastens, God too works with him. And now for all my friends a fount of evils Seems to be found. And this my son, not knowing, In youth's rash mood, hath wrought; for he did think To curb the sacred Hellespont with fetters, As though it were his slave, and sought to alter The stream of God, full-flowing Bosporos, And with his hammered chains around it cast, Prevailed to make his mighty host a highway; And though a mortal, thought, with no good counsel, To master all the Gods, yea, e'en Poseidon. Nay, was not my poor son oppressed with madness? And much I fear lest all my heaped-up treasure Become the spoil and prey of the first comer. Atoss. Such lessons haughty Xerxes hath been taught By intercourse with men of evil mood: Probably Mardonios and Onomacritos the Athenian soothsayer are referred to, who, according to Herodotos (vii. 6, viii. 99) were the chief instigators of the expedition. Who say that thou great wealth for thy sons gained'st By thy spear's might, while he in cowardice Does his spear-work indoors, and nothing adds Unto his father's glory. Such reproach Hearing full oft from men of evil mood, He planned this expedition against Hellas. Dar. Thus then a deed portentous hath been wrought, Ever to be remembered, such as ne'er Falling on Susa made it desolate, Since Zeus our king ordained this dignity, That one man should be lord of Asia's plains, Where feed her thousand flocks, and hold the rod Of sovran guidance: for the Median first Astyages, the father-in-law of Kyaxares and grandfather of Kyros. In this case Ãschylos must be supposed to accept Xenophon's statement that Kyaxares succeeded Astyages. Possibly, however, the Median may be Kyaxares I., the father of Astyages, and so the succession here would harmonise with that of Herodotos. The whole succession must be looked on as embodying the loose, floating notions of the Athenians as to the history of their great enemy, rather than as the result of inquiry. Ruled o'er the host, and then his son in turn Finished the work, for reason steered his soul; And Kyros came as third, full richly blest, And ruled, and gained great peace for all his friends; And he won o'er the Lydians and the Phrygians, And conquered all the wide Ionian land; Stress is laid on the violence to which the Asiatic Ionians had succumbed, and their resistance to which distinguished them from the Lydians or Phrygians, whose submission had been voluntary. For such his wisdom, he provoked not God. And Kyros' son came fourth, and ruled the host; And Mardos fifth held sway, his country's shame, Mardos. Under this name we recognise the Pseudo-Smerdis of Herodotos, (iii. 67,) who, by restoring the dominion of the Median Magi, the caste to which he himself belonged, brought shame upon the Persians. Shame to the ancient throne; and him with guile Artaphrenes Possibly another form of Intaphernes, who appears in Herodotos (iii 70) as one of the seven conspirators against the Magian Pseudo-Smerdis. the brave smote down, close leagued With men, his friends, to whom the work was given. [Sixth, Maraphis and seventh Artaphrenes.] And I obtained this post that I desired, And with a mighty host great victories won. Yet no such evil brought I on the state; But my son Xerxes, young, thinks like a youth, And all my solemn charge remembers not; For know this well, my old companions true, That none of us who swayed the realm of old Did e'er appear as working ills like these. Chor. What then, O King Dareios? To what end Lead'st thou thy speech? And how, in this our plight, Could we the Persian people prosper best? Dar. If ye no more attack the Hellenes' land, E'en though the Median host outnumber theirs. To them the land itself is true ally. Chor. What meanest thou? How fights the land for them? Dar. It slays with famine those vast multitudes. Chor. We then a host, select, compact, will raise. Dar. Nay, e'en the host which now in Hellas stays The force of 300,000 left in Greece under Mardonios, (Herod. viii. 113,) afterwards defeated at PlatÃ¦a. Will ne'er return in peace and safety home. Chor. How say'st thou? Does not all the barbarous host Cross from Europa o'er the straits of HellÃ¨? Dar. But few of many; if 'tis meet for one Who looks upon the things already done To trust the oracles of Gods; for they, Not these or those but all, are brought to pass: And if this be so, then on vain hopes resting, Comp. the speech of Mardonios urging this plan on Xerxes, (Herod. viii. 100.) He leaves a chosen portion of his army: And they abide where, watering all the plain AsÃ´pos pours his fertilising stream Dear to BÅotian land; and there of ills The topmost crown awaits them, penalty Of wanton outrage and of godless thoughts; For they to Hellas coming, held not back In awe from plundering even fanes of Gods This was of course a popular topic with the Athenians, whose own temples had been outraged. But other sanctuaries also, the temples at Delphi and AbÃ¦ had shared the same fate, and these sins against the Gods of Hellas were naturally connected in the thoughts of the Greeks with the subsequent disasters of the Persians. In Egypt these outrages had an iconoclastic character. In Athens they were a retaliation for the destruction of the temple at Sardis, (Herod. v. 102.) And burning down their temples; and laid low Are altars, and the shrines of Gods o'erthrown, E'en from their base. They therefore having wrought Deeds evil, now are suffering, and will suffer Evil not less, and not as yet is seen The deep foundation of the ills, but still They grow up to completeness. Such a stream Of blood and slaughter soon shall flow from them By Dorian spear upon PlatÃ¦an ground, The reference to the prominent part taken by the Peloponnesian forces in the battle of PlatÃ¦Ã¦ is probably due to the political sympathies of the dramatist. And heaps of corpses shall to children's children, Though speechless, witness to the eyes of men That mortal man should not wax overproud; For wanton pride from blossom grows to fruit, The full corn in the ear, of utter woe, And reaps a tear-fraught harvest. Seeing then, Such recompense of these things, cherish well The memory of Athens and of Hellas; Let no man in his scorn of present fortune, And thirst for other, mar his good estate; Zeus is the avenger of o'erlofty thoughts, A terrible controller. Therefore now, Since voice of God bids him be wise of heart, Admonish him with counsel true and good To cease his daring sacrilegious pride; And thou, O Xerxes' mother, old and dear, Go to thy home, and taking what apparel Is fitting, go to meet thy son; for all The costly robes around his limbs are torn To rags and shreds in very agony. But do thou kindly soothe his soul with words; For he to thee alone will deign to hearken; But I must leave the earth for darkness deep: And ye, old men, farewell, although in woe, And give your soul its daily bread of joy; For to the dead no profit bringeth wealth. [Exit, disappearing in the earth. Chor. I shudder as I hear the many woes Both past and present that on Persians fall. Atoss. [O God, how many evils fall on me! The speech of Atossa is rejected by Paley, on internal grounds, as spurious. And yet this one woe biteth more than all, Hearing my son's shame in the rags of robes That clothe his limbs. But I will go and take A fit adornment from my house, and try To meet my son. We will not in his troubles Basely abandon him whom most we love.] Chor. Stroph. I. Ah me! a glorious and a blessed life Had we as subjects once, When our old king, Dareios, ruled the land, Meeting all wants, dispassionate, supreme, A monarch like a God. Antistroph. I. For first we showed the world our noble hosts; And laws of tower-like strength Directed all things; and our backward march After our wars unhurt, unsuffering led Our prospering armies home. Stroph. II. How many towns he took, Not crossing Halys' stream Apparently an allusion to the oracle given to CrÅsos, that he, if he crossed the Halys, should destroy a great kingdom. Nor issuing from his home, There where in Strymon's sea, The Acheloian Isles The name originally given to the Echinades, a group of islands at the mouth of the AcheloÃ¶s, was applied generically to all islands lying near the mouth of great rivers, and here, probably, includes Imbros, Thasos, and SamothrakÃ¨. Lie near the coasts of Thrakian colonies. Antistroph. II. And those that lie outside the ÃgÃ¦an sea, The cities girt with towers, They hearkened to our king; And those who boast their site By HellÃ¨'s full, wide stream, Propontis with its bays, and mouth of Pontos broad. Stroph. III. And all the isles that lie Facing the headland jutting in the sea, The geography is somewhat obscure, but the words seem to refer to the portion of the islands that are named as opposite (in a southerly direction) to the promontory of the Troad. Close bound to this our coast; Lesbos, and Samos with its olive groves; Chios and Paros too; Naxos and Myconos, and Andros too On Tenos bordering. Antistroph. III. And so he ruled the isles That lie midway between the continents, Lemnos, Icaria's land; Rhodos and Cnidos and the Kyprian towns, Paphos and Salamis, And with them Soli famed, Whose parent city now our groans doth cause; Salamis in Kypros had been colonised by Teukros the son of Aias, and had received its name in remembrance of the island in the Saronic Gulf. Epode. And many a wealthy town and populous, Of Hellenes in the Ionian region dwelling, He governed at his will; His was the unconquered strength of warrior host, Allies of mingled race. And now, beyond all doubt, In strife of war defeated utterly, We find this high estate Through wrath of God o'erturned By bitter loss at sea. Enter Xerxes in kingly apparel, but with his robes rent, with Attendants. Xer. Oh, miserable me! Who this dark hateful doom That I expected least Have met with as my lot, How stern and fierce of mood Towards the Persian race God has displayed himself! What woe will come on me? Gone is my strength of limb, These aged men beholding. Ah, would to Heaven, O Zeus, That with the men who fell Death's doom had covered me! Chor. Ah woe, O king, woe! woe! For the army brave in fight, And our goodly Persian name, And the fair array of men, Whom God hath now cut off! And the land bewails its youth Who for our Xerxes fell, For him whose deeds have filled Hades with Persian souls; For many heroes now Are Hades-travellers, Our country's chosen flower, Mighty with darts and bow; For lo! the myriad mass Of men has perished quite. Woe, woe for our fair fame! And Asia's land, O King, Is terribly, most terribly, overthrown. Xer. I then, oh misery! Have to my curse been proved Sore evil to my country and my race. Chor. Yea, and on thy return I will lift up my voice in wailing sore, Cry of sore-troubled thought, As of a mourner born In Mariandynian land, Lament of many tears. Antistroph. I. Xer. Yea, utter ye a wail Dreary and full of grief; For lo! the face of Fate Against me now is turned. Chor. Yea, I will raise a cry Dreary and full of grief, Giving this tribute due To all the people's woes, And all our loss at sea, Troubles of this our State That mourneth for her sons; Yea, I will wail full sore, With flood of bitter tears. Stroph. II. Xer. For lo! our naval host, Giving victory to our foes, Has from Ionians, yea, Ionians, suffered loss, Leaving the dark sea's plain, And that ill-omened shore, Stripped of its strength for war. Chor. Yea, wail, search out the whole; Where are our other friends? Where thy companions true, Such as Pharandakes, Susas, Pelagon, Psammis, Dotamas, Agdabatas, Susiskanes From Ecbatana who started? Antistroph. II. Xer. I left them low in death, Falling from Tyrian ship, On Salaminian shores, Beating now here, now there, On the hard rock-girt coast. Chor. Ah, where Pharnuchos then, And Ariomardos brave? And where Sevalkes king, LilÃ¦os proud of race, Memphis and Tharybis, Masistras, and Artembares, HystÃ¦chmas? This I ask. Stroph. III. Xer. Woe! woe is me! They have looked on at Athens' ancient towers, Her hated towers, ah me! All, as by one fell stroke, Unhappy in their fate Lie gasping on the shore. Chor. And he, thy faithful Eye, The name seems to have been an official title for some Inspector-General of the Army. Comp. Aristoph. Acharn. v. 92. Who told the Persian host, Myriads on myriads o'er, As in the account which Herodotos gives (vii. 60) of the way in which the army of Xerxes was numbered, sc., by enclosing 10,000 men in a given space, and then filling it again and again till the whole army had passed through. Alpistos, son and heir Of BatanÃ´chos old, And the son of brave Sesames, Son himself of Megabates. Parthos, and the great Åbares, Did'st thou leave them, did'st thou leave them? Ah, woe! ah, woe is me, For those unhappy ones! Thou to the Persians brave Tellest of ills on ills. Antistroph. III. Xer. Ah, thou dost wake in me The memory of the spell of yearning love For comrades brave and true, Telling of cursed ills, Yea, cursed, hateful doom; And lo, within my frame My heart cries out, cries out. Chor. Yea, another too we long for, Xanthes, captain of ten thousand Mardian warriors, and Anchares Arian born, and great Arsakes And DiÃ¦xis, lords of horsemen, Kigdagatas and Lythimnas, Tolmos, longing for the battle: Much I marvel, much I marvel, Another reading givesâ âThey are buried, they are buried.â For they come not, as the rear-guard Of thy tent on chariot mounted. Perhaps referring to the waggon-chariots in which the rider reclined at ease, either protected by a canopy, or, as in the Assyrian sculptures and perhaps in the East generally, overshadowed by a large umbrella which an eunuch holds over him. Stroph. IV. Xer. Gone those rulers of the army. Chor. Gone are they in death inglorious. Xer. Ah woe! ah woe! Alas! alas! Chor. Ah! the Gods have sent upon us Ill we never thought to look on, Conspicuous like to which in sorrow Ne'er hath AtÃ¨ seen another. Antistroph. IV. Xer. Smitten we by many sorrows Such as come on men but seldom. Chor. Smitten we, 'tis all too certain. Xer. Fresh woes! fresh woes! ah me! Chor. Now with adverse turn of fortune, With Ionian seamen meeting, Fails in war the race of Persians. Stroph. V. Xer. Too true. Yea I and that vast host of mine Are smitten down. Chor. Too trueâthe Persians' majesty and might Have perished utterly. Xer. See'st thou this remnant of my armament? Chor. I see it, yea, I see. Xer. (pointing to his quiver.) Dost see thou that which arrows wont to hold? ... Chor. What speak'st thou of as saved? Xer. This treasure-store for darts. Chor. Few, few of many left! Xer. Thus we all helpers lack. Chor. Ionian soldiers flee not from the spear. Antistroph. V. Xer. Yea, very brave are they, and I have seen Unlooked-for woe. Chor. Wilt tell of squadron of our sea-borne ships Defeated utterly? Xer. I tore my robes at this calamity. Chor. Ah me, ah me, ah me! Xer. Ay, more than all âah me'sâ! Chor. Two-fold and three-fold ills! Xer. Grievous to usâbut joy, Great joy, to all our foes! Chor. Lopped off is all our strength. Xer. Stripped bare of escort I! Chor. Yea, by sore loss at sea Disastrous to thy friends. Stroph. VI. Xer. Weep for our sorrow, weep, Yea, go ye to the house. Chor. Woe for our griefs, woe, woe! Xer. Cry out an echoing cry. Chor. Ill gift of ills on ills. Xer. Weep on in wailing chant. Chor. Oh! ah! Oh! ah! Xer. Grievous our bitter woes. Chor. Ah me, I mourn them sore. Antistroph. VI. Xer. Ply, ply your hands and groan; Yea, for my sake bewail. Chor. I weep in bitter grief. Xer. Cry out an echoing cry. Chor. Yea, we may raise our voice, O Lord and King, in wail. Xer. Raise now shrill cry of woe. Chor. Ah me! Ah! Woe is me! Xer. Yea, with it mingle dark. ... Chor. And bitter, grievous blows. Stroph. VII. Xer. Yea, beat thy breast, and cry After the Mysian type. Chor. Oh, misery! oh, misery! Xer. Yea, tear the white hair off thy flowing beard. Chor. Yea; with clenched hands, with clenchÃ¨d hands, I say, In very piteous guise. Xer. Cry out, cry out aloud. Chor. That also will I do. Antistroph. VII. Xer. And with thy fingers tear Thy bosom's folded robe. Chor. Oh, misery! oh, misery! Xer. Yea, tear thy hair in wailing for our host. Chor. Yea, with clenched hands, I say, with clenchÃ¨d hands, In very piteous guise. Xer. Be thine eyes wet with tears. Chor. Behold the tears stream down. Epode. Xer. Raise a re-echoing cry. Chor. Ah woe! ah woe! Xer. Go to thy home with wailing loud and long. Chor. O land of Persia, full of lamentations! Xer. Through the town raise your cries. Chor. We raise them, yea, we raise. Xer. Wail, wail, ye men that walked so daintily. Chor. O land of Persia, full of lamentations! Woe! woe! Xer. Alas for those who in the triremes perished! Chor. With piteous words of woe will I escort thee. [Exeunt in procession, wailing, and rending their robes.</field>
