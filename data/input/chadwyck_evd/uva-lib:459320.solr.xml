      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF DARIVS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. Darivs, the fourteenth from Cyrus King of Persia, being after the death of Occhus, for his singular valour, from the government of Armenia, advanc'd to the Persian Empire, became so arrogant (a good successe as it were satting him forward to confusion) as he sent to demand tribute of Philip then King of Macedonia who being of a hauty nature (and inferiour to none of that age in courage, or for military discipline) requited this contumelious message, with as disdainefull an answer; threatning that he would come and deliver it in Persepolis. But being prevented by death, he left the execution of his designe to his sonne Alexander, who for the great victories which thereafter he obtained, was surnamed the great. He inheriting the hatred of his Father towards Darius, and farre surmounting him in ambition, past in person to Asia, with an army of thirty thousand men onely. After his arrivall, Darius wrote to him in a proud and contemptible manner, ascribing to himselfe the title of the King of Kings, and kinsman of the Gods, and naming Alexander his servant; Hee also in vaunting manner, bragged that he would have that mad boy, the sonne of Philip (for so in derision be tearmed him) bound, and beaten with roddes, and after brought to his presence apparelled like a Prince. For performance whereof he directed one of his Minions, with forty thousand men to make impediment to his passage at the River of Granick, where by the wonderfull valour of Alexander, they were overthrowne. Darius being advertised of this, came himselfe in proper person, accompanied with infinite (but evill ordered) numbers, and encountred Alexander beside Isso, in the strait of Cilicia where having fought a doubtfull and bloudy battell, in end by the invincible valour and never-failing fortune of Alexander his Army was defeated, himselfe put to flight, and his mother, wife, and children made captives. Who were most courteously entertained by Alexander, who notwithstanding their exceeding great beauty, yet would not abuse them, nor suffer them to bee abused by others: nor visited he them more then once (and that to comfort them) all the time of their imprisonment. Darius, notwithstanding of all his losses (his courage being in the full, whilst his fortune was in the waine) wrote very proudly to Alexander, taking still the title of a King to himselfe, but not giving it to him, offering him as much gold, as Macedon could containe, for ransome of the captives. Which being very disdainfully refused by Alexander, he having re-enforced his troupes, and comming forward to fight with greater force then before, was informed how his wife had died in prison, whose death he bewailed with exceeding great sorrow. And understanding what courtesie Alexander had used towards her, he sent to sue for peace, not for any feare of his force, but allured (as he alledged) by his courtesie. This sute being likewise rejected, he fought beside Arbella, with no better fortune then before. Yet for all these misfortunes, being of an invincible courage and despairing of peace, he re-assembled all his forces. which were augmented by the comming of the Bactrians, and was comming forward, with intention at last either to dye, or prevaile. But in the meane time, two traiterous subjects of his owne, Bessus, whom he had preferred to be governour of Bactria, and Nabarzanes, one in speciall credit with him, conspired his death. Which danger, though it was revealed to him by Patron, Captaine of the Greekes, yet he could not, or rather would not eschew. At length, those two Traitours tooke, and bound him with golden chaines, and cast him in an old Chariot, with purpose to present him to Alexander. But they hearing how he would not accept their Present, and how he was comming to invade them, threw their darts at Darius, and left him for dead. In this estate he was found by Polystratus, and after the delivery of some few words dyed. Alexander having exceedingly lamented his miserable and undeserved end, directed his body to his mother Sisigambis to be honourably buried.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene supposed in Babylon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Darius. What thund'ring pow'r grown jealous of my state, Which (having daunted th'earth) perchance heaven fears Thus arm'd with lightning, breathing flames of hate, Big with disdaine, high indignation beares? Long smooth'd of all, whilst I (pale cares despis'd) In fortunes lap asleep, of greatnesse dream'd, Even in that calme, my state a storme surpris'd, And ere I wak't, my ruine was proclam'd; Thus I, whose onely name did terrour give (As Idoll of the world,) ador'd over all, (With crosses compass'd,) such a wretch doe live, That who admir'd my might, admire my fall; Ah, then indeed I fell, when gallants stood, And PhÅnix-like renew'd their lives by death; Who having seal'd their force, and faith, with bloud, Would rather dye, then draw a borrowed breath; Yet I, not I, did view, not venge (though neare) Those monstrous mountaines of my Subjects slaine, Though even my enemies must my courage cleare, Which flames of fury lightned forth in vaine; Through greatest dangers, death I did pursue, Till heapes of slaughtred bodies barr'd my way, And chang'd my Chariot to a scarlet hue, Ere wounded honour could be drawne away; O how I envy yet their happy Ghosts, Who dy'd whilst hope of victory remain'd, And in the presence of two famous hosts, To praise their valour, even their foes constrain'd: Shall I survive that memorable shame, Which Persia's glory with disgrace confin'd? No, rather let me dye, and let my name As vaine, quite vanish, raz'd from every minde. Starre-boasting Babylon, all Asia's Queene, Blush to behold thy King in such a state, That by the gazing world he now is seene, (A scorned suter) humbly to entreate; But not turn'd vassall, as by pow'r appall'd; Though all my Empire to a period come, Yet none shall vaunt that ever I was thrall'd: âHearts holding courage, are not quite o're-come. Should I whose Soveraignty so oft was sworne, Be seene submisse to scape a minutes paines, No, let them bow, who but to bow were borne: For Darius this indignity disdaines, Since I was once judg'd worthy to command, Shall I descend a Subjects state to try? No, whilst a sword yeelds homage to this hand, I scorne to grant a greater man then I. Brave sprites, who now possesse the pleasant bow'rs, And glorious Gardens of th'Elysian Plaines, (For, (if deserts may move th'infernall pow'rs) That happy shade your shadowes now containes) Those fatall fields where I did leade you forth, Your bodies bury, but enlarge your fames, Men shall adore the relickes of your worth, And Trophees reare to your immortall names; I'le sacrifice as Incense to your soules, His dying sighes, and sorrowing Parents teares, Who now, whilst none his prospering pride controules, Our conquer'd Ensignes in his triumph beares: For, it may ease your Ghosts to heare his grones, Whilst burden'd earth rebounding backe doth send A wailing eccho (rais'd from woods and stones,) With wounded words to shew that Armies end. Why spend I speeches to disturbe your rest, As but with words (an idle speaker) pleas'd? A mighty fury hath enflam'd my brest, And I will rage, till by revenge appeas'd. Did I that strong Cadusian first afront, Who durst advance himselfe to brave our bands, Then turn'd applauded, and in high account, Charg'd with his spoiles, the honour of my hands? What, could I then (all kinde of doubt remov'd) Alone adventure to an Armies shame? And should I now (that ancient praise disprov'd) With squadrons compass'd, lose that glorious name? Blinde fortune, O! thy stratagems are strange! Which spoile my pow'r, and staine my honour too, And (having made my state the stage of change) Hast acted all was in thy power to doe; Loe, I, who late of swarming troups did boast, Neere left alone, have fortunes fraud disclos'd; And those made captives whom I fancy most, To vaunting Victors are by fates expos'd: O torment but to thinke, death to beleeve, That any may my dearest part annoy, And I, wretch'd I, not able to releeve Mine eyes chiefe jewell, and my hearts chiefe joy, Deare object of my thoughts, my life, my love, Sweet Spring of my delights, my one, my all, Bright image of th'excellencies above, What? do'st thou breath, and com'st not when I call? And can I be, and not be where thou art? Hath heaven the force me from thy face to barre? Or are my hands growne traitours to my heart? That they should shrinke from doing what it dare: O! could my minde but distribute a space Those emulating thoughts which tosse my brest, To pointlesse ciphers, who but spend a place, Then I alone might animate the rest; Since in this great disgrace, I chanc'd to fall, Now nothing rests to raise my fame forlorne, But by some desperate course to hazard all; I'le live with praise, or by my death flye scorne; Some prosp'rous issue afterward may purge This crime which fortune hath impos'd on me, This crime that carryes with it selfe a scourge: No greater torment then the want of thee; âBut fortunes course, what mortall can restraine, âWho Diadems through dust for sport doth roule? A stranger now o're my delights doth raigne, And may extort the treasures of my soule; Now, not till now, I apprehend my harmes, When I imagine how my best belov'd Must entertaine mine enemy in her armes, And I so farre from offering ayde remov'd; A host of furies in my brest I finde, Which doe my soule with dreadfull horrours fill, Whilst Melancholy musters in my minde Strange apprehensions that affright me still; And this surmiz'd disgrace, grown throughly strong, Reades hourely in mine eares a hatefull scroule Of an imagin'd, yet a helpelesse wrong, Such poison'd thoughts like Serpents sting my soule; Blinde love beguiles me not, sharpe sighted feares With reason fed, doe make suspition live: Would God that I had neither eyes nor eares, Which to the heart intelligence might give; This aggravates the weight of my despaire, When doubt objects to breake loves last defence, How he is yong and fierce, she yong and faire, He to offend, she subject to offence; From wronging me, both cannot long abstaine: Her beauty is sufficient to allure, His bravery is sufficient to obtaine. âCaptaines will force, and Captives must endure. O Alexander, tender my renowne, Though thus thou travell to usurpe my throne, âI rage to have a rivall in my Crowne, âBut in my love I can comport with none, That boundlesse flame which in thy bosome boyles, If quench'd with ought save bloud (as base) I blame: My fortunes take, but spare her honours spoiles, Which not thy glory, yet must breed our shame. But pardon deare that which griev'd thoughts burst sorth, More bright thy fame, that darkened is my state, âBy many meanes men may approve their worth: âA woman onely with a wretched mate: âChast mindes still pure, doe then most firmely stand, âWhen fortifi'd with wedlockes sacred band. Yet let me doubt, or let me leave to love, âTo feare the worst it is affections part: I doubt not of thy truth; yet it may prove Thy face betray thy faith, thy hap thy heart; But on thy worth my confidence relyes, This doth dissolve suspitions power againe; I will repell reports as stand'rous lyes, Which would my judgement, or thy vertue staine. Though fortune now my ruine doth designe, Yet, with that traitresse scorne to be conjur'd, She soone may helpe her fault, thou never thine: âNo helpe for honours wounds, all else are cur'd. Chorus. âO more then miserable minde, âWhich of all things it selfe worst knowes! âAnd through presumption made quite blinde, âIs puffed up with every winde, âWhich fortune in derision blowes. âThe man no stable blisse can finde, âWhose heart is guided by his eye, âAnd trusts too much betraying showes, âWhich make a cunning lye; âOft short prosperity âBreeds long adversity: âFor, who abuse the first, the last o'rethrowes. âWhat thing so good which not some harme may bring? âEven to be happy is a dangerous thing. âWho on himselfe too much depends, âAnd makes an Idoll of his wit: âFor every favour fortune sends, âSelfe-flatterer still himselfe commends, âAnd will no sound advice admit, âBut at himselfe beginnes and ends, âAnd never takes a moments leisure âTo try what fault he may commit: âBut, drunke with frothes of pleasure, âThirsts for praise above measure, âImaginary treasure, âWhich slowly comes, and flyes at every fit; âAnd what is most commended at this time, âSucceeding ages may account a crime. A mighty man who is respected, And by his Subjects thought a God, Thinkes as his name on high erected, Hath what he list at home effected, It may like wonders worke abroad, O how this folly is detected! For, though he sit in Royall seate, And as he list his vassals lode, Yet others who are great, Live not by his conceit, Nor weigh what he doth threat, But plague his pride oft ere he feare the rod; There are rare qualities requir'd in Kings, âA naked name can never worke great things. They who themselves too much esteeme, And vainely vilipend their foe, Oft finde not fortune as they deeme, And with their treasure would redeeme Their errour past; behold even so Our King of blame doth worthy sceme, His adversary who did scorne And thought who in his name did goe, The laurell should have worne, His triumphs to adorne, But he with shame hath shorne The fruits of folly ever ripe with woe: âAn enemy (if it be well advis'd) (âThough seeming weake,) should never be despis But what? the Minions of our Kings Who speake at large, and are beleev'd, Dare brag of many mighty things, As they could flye, though wanting wings, And deeds by words might be atchiev'd; But time at length their lies to light, Their Soveraigne to confusion brings: Yet so they gaine, they are not griev'd, But charme their Princes sight, And make what's wrong, seeme right, Thus ruine they his might: That when he would, he cannot be reliev'd, âMoe Kings in chambers fall by flatteries charms, âThen in the field by th' adversaries Armes. Loe, though the successe hath approv'd What Charidemus had fore-showne, Yet with his words no man was mov'd, âFor good men first must be remov'd, âBefore their worth can well be known; The King would heare but what he lov'd, And what him pleas'd not, did despise, So were the better sort o'rethrowne; And Sycophants unwise, Who could the truth disguise, Were suffered high to rise, That him who rais'd them up, they might cast downe: âThus Princes will not heare, though some deceive them, âThings as they are, but as themselves conceive them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2. Alexander, Parmenio. Behold, the heavens with a benigne aspect, To prosper this brave enterprise intend, And with propitious Starres seeme to direct This great beginning to a glorious end. âWho would be famous, must of force aspire, All those (astonish'd) who my Troupes doe view, Doubt of these two, which most they should admire, My comming, or my conquering with so few; âSo mighty mindes whilst for great actions bent, âForce fortune oft to favour them in all, âWhere brests more base divining bad event, âThrough superstitious feares procure their fall. O how I wonder, when I call to minde That monstrous campe, which not so much as doubted, Dimme seem'd the sunne, while as their armour shin'd. Men had not heard the thunder, whilst they shouted. Avant-couroures advanced to examine, When they so meane my numbers had perceiv'd, Did thinke them small to satisfie the famine That their huge host of slaughter had conceiv'd; And yet in end this prov'd a poyson'd food, Which of their owne to their confusion yeelds, Huge mounts of murthered corpes, and seas of bloud: Unburied bodies buried all the fields. So now, that few whom they contemn'd so farre, (See how mortality it selfe deceives) Have quite o're-match'd their multitudes in warre; And made the world neere waste to people graves. Then, deare Parmenio, since the fates afford So faire an entry to our first designes, Let us goe follow (lantern'd by the sword,) That fortune which the heavens our hopes assignes. Parm. This high attempt, as we would wish succeeds, What hosts have we o'rethrown, what Cities raz'd? Loe, populous Asia trembles at our deeds, And martiall Europe doth remaine amaz'd; Greece, (which both Mars and Pallas did defend:) A humble supplicant before thee falles, Rebellious Thebes, which durst with thee contend, Lyes now entomb'd within her broken walles; That Sea-commanding Tyre, reposing much In liquid Towers that Neptune rear'd in vaine, Hath now confirm'd thy forces to be such, That nothing can resist thy just disdaine. No doubt the ancient Grecians Ghosts are glad To see the fierce Barbarians brought so low, Yet are for envy of thy fortune sad, And though un-bodied blush at this o're-throw: Miltiades by all men was admir'd, Who once in Greece their flying troupes pursu'd, And he who with a stratagem retir'd, And Salamina's straits with bloud imbru'd; But yet for all the Captaines of that age, The easterne Monarches Empire was enlarg'd, Who in their Country (flaming all with rage,) The Sea with shippes, the land with Armies charg'd, He with moe swarmes of men then Autumnes clusters, Dranke Rivers dry, and march'd on Neptunes backe, By measure, not by number, made his musters, Did scourge the windes, striv'd mountaines plaines to make; All Europe fear'd then to be forc'd to bow, Whilst th'earth did groane to beare so great an host; But thou hast come, seene, and over-com'd them now, Even in the bounds wherein their pow'r was most. That haughty foe, who vilipended oft Our predecessors force, and scorn'd our owne, Now laid as low, as he was once aloft, With his disgrace, must make thy valour knowne; He doth by this acknowledge his distresse, In labouring thus to have his friends restor'd, This message (mighty Prince) imports no lesse, By his request thy conquest is decor'd, For the recovery of his captiv'd Queene, He offred hath innumerable gold; A masse so great, that such was never seene, More (as they bragge) then Macedon can hold: My counsell is, that you accept his offers, And with his daughters render her againe, âWho would make warre, must not have empty coffers, âWhere one for glory, thousands sight for gaine; And if those Ladies guarded Captives stay, It cost and trouble breeds to fit their state; Thus more to charge, or charges to defray, To vexe or ease, advise, and not too late. Alex. If come to trafficke in a servile sort, And like a Merchant bent but to embrace (All else despis'd) that which might gaines import, Then your opinion purchase might a place: But soone I surfet of such melting things, And famish but for fame, and Crownes of Kings. Parm. If Alexander, I, so would I doe. Alex. If I Parmenio were, so would I too. Parm. So you binde Souldiers, let them Dames redeeme. Alex. Save thankes, or praise, no treasure I esteeme. Parm. Even good proves ill when done unto a foe. Alex. What greater glory then to conquer so? Parm. âGold is the God that conquers in all parts. Alex. âTrue magnanimity doth ravish hearts. Parm. âWarrs sinewes treasures are which most not faile. Alex. âStout brests, strong hands (not basely given) prevaile. Parm. âThe want of wages makes a mutinous band. Alex. âBut who dare disobey when I command? Parm. âThose are thought fooles, who riches do disdain. Alex. âA gallant minde likes glory more then gaine. Parm. But who delights in such an eiery store? Alex. If I be singular, I seeke no more. Parm. âThe truth by Princes is not understood: But yet I heare your Souldiers oft exclaime, That your ambition but exhausts their bloud, Who perish all to purchase you a name; Yet carelesse what they lose, so you may winne, That like your minde, your kingdome may want bounds, One battels end, another doth beginne, Whilst you the glory gaine, they nought but wounds; Such rash reports oft blowne in every eare, Doe breed base grudge, and loftie tumults too, âWhen leaving reverence, duty, love and feare, âWhat dare not mutinous troupes attempt to doe? Retire in time while as the heavens are cleare; You have perform'd, perform'd, and that even soone, More then your own could hope, your foes could feare, Yea (yet more strange) then some can trust, though done; Your worth in warre (as bright as glory) showne, Which even by envy never could be stain'd, Your skill in peace would likewise now be knowne: Calme vertue guiding, what sterne valour gain'd: âA State well rul'd, the fame of Kings doth raise, âNo lesse then foughten fields, or batter'd Townes. âMore hard it is, and doth deserve more praise âTo guide, then get, to keep, then conquer Crownes: In Fortunes spheares chiefe height your glory plac'd, Can now not move unlesse it be more low, And if it once descend, then quite disgrac'd, Each Artizan your Statues will o're-throw; For in the warre as you may well perceive, There doth no little part depend on Fame; If we but once the least small check receive, The world will gather to procure our shame; Then tempt not Fortune further then you need, Your rashly mounting thoughts let reason raine, Lest whil'st your hopes with Trophees fain'd you feed, A moment lose what many dayes did gaine. Let Darius prove all Monarchs patterne now (What wandring Starre doth sway the course of Crownes) That Prince to whom the Orient once did bow, Him onely now his misery renownes, Scarce mov'd to call you King, though twise o're-throwne, At last to match with you he doth agree, And with his daughter hath for dowry showne That great Euphrates shall your border be; Or otherwise he condescends to give Great store of gold, or what your selfe desires, If that his mother, wife, and children live, To have them rendred, as he oft requires: And let not loftie thoughts cloud Reasons eyes, Remember what strange Realmes will him embrace, Which scarce he knows, by name, nor never tryes, Where if he fled, your troups would tyre to chace. Alex. Peace. peace Parmenio, now thou mak'st me rage, With those thy words not worthy of our eares; It seemes the coldnesse of declining age Hath kill'd thy courage with a frost of feares: Did I abandon thee my native soyle, And made my Ensignes shadow forraine fields, As fear'd for danger, or else flying toyle, That I should turne whil'st yet our foe not yeelds? Then all my labours are but lost at last, Which have but bred an appetite of praise, That I might dye displeas'd, the time once past, When meanes remain'd, a state like Ioves, to raise: No, I will raigne, and I will raigne alone, Disdaining to admit of more Commanders: For (as the Heavens can hold no Sunne but one) The Earth cannot containe two Alexanders; The spatious circuit of this peopled Round, Seemes not sufficient to confine my thought, And, O, would God there could moe worlds be found, That many might to grace our deeds be brought; O! I could wish that th'ocean were firme Land, Where none but hideous Gyants had retreat, Such as at Phlegra field in strife did stand Against the gods for the etheriall seat: These could encourage martiall mindes to strike, Who when subdu'd, would yeeld eternall praise. I conquer men, but many did the like, And after-ages may my equall raise: But since none such my triumphs are to grace, Such as there are, Ile to subjection bring, And as a pest, I vow to flie all peace, Till all the world adore me for their King: Let them retyre in time who danger dread, Yet thinke on this (whil'st glory bent to wed) That ye abandon'd me in time of need, And that I stay'd to fight when as ye fled; Passe home in darknesse, servile rest to finde, I measure not my courage by my numbers. Par. Your majestie doth much mistake my minde, You know what I endur'd, what cares, what cumbers; And for my part, I to your eyes appeale, Which well can witnesse what my hands have wrought, All what I spake, proceeded of cleare zeale, And not of cowardice, or feare of ought; Nor match I vile repose with honest paines, My courage (oft-times try'd) is not grown cold, Nor yet that vigour hath not left my veines, Which spurr'd my sprite in youth, though I be old. Alex. T'is not enough, that you your selfe be so, To be the same you should the rest exhort; Is he return'd, who was ordain'd to go And view the captives? what doth he report? Parm. As we have heard of him who thither went, While they as yet not of support despair'd, And courteously were led unto a Tent Which we of purpose caus'd to be prepar'd: Even in the way one fortun'd there to spie The Diademe which Darius ear'st had borne, (Though glorious once) which low on th'earth did lye, As earst for pompe, then wondred at with scorne. Straight they imagin'd from his Royall head, Whose dignity it sometime did decore, None could it cast except himselfe were dead, And if so were, they wish'd to live no more: When they had entred in the Tent to weep, Your Servant came, and at the entry knock'd, Who (finding them so quiet) thought a sleep Had clos'd their eyes, or else that he was mock'd, At length by force he made a patent way, And was advanc'd them lovingly to greet, When (loe) the Ladies prostrated all lay, And with a floud of teares be-dew'd his feet. Then said (by death expecting to be free) Let us entombe great Darius like a King; Then when we first his funerall honour see, Death must to us a great contentment bring; This oft they urg'd, though he attested there That Darius was not dead (as they suppos'd) But liv'd with hope, his ruines to repaire, And in the pow'r of other Realmes repos'd. Then did he urge what comfort and reliefe They might attend, depending on your Grace; Thus having toil'd to mitigate their griefe, It seem'd they long'd to see my Soveraignes face, Alex. I pitie still, and not insult o're such, (Though once mine Enemies) who are humbled so, And lest weake feare oppresse their mindes too much, To comfort them, straight to their Tent I'le go. Exeunt. Chorus. âOf all the passions which possesse the soule, âNone so disturbes vaine Mortals mindes, âAs vaine Ambition which so blindes âThe light of them, that nothing can controll, âNor curb their thoughts who will aspire; âThis raging vehement desire âOf Soveraignty no satisfaction findes, âBut in the breasts of men doth ever roule âThe restlesse stone of Sisyph to torment them, âAnd as his heart who stole the heavenly fire, âThe Vulture gnaws, so doth that monster rent them: âHad they the world, the world would not content them. This race of Ixion to embrace the clouds, Contemne the state wherein they stand, And save themselves, would all command; âAs one desire is quench'd, another buds, When they have travell'd all their time, Heapt bloud on bloud, and crime on crime, There is an higher power that guides their hand: More happie he whom a poore Cottage shronds Against the tempest of the threatning heaven; He stands in feare of none, none envies him; His heart is upright, and his wayes are even, Where others states are still twixt six and seven. That damned wretch up with Ambition blowne, Then whil'st he turnes the wheele about, Throwne high, and low, within, without, In striving for the top is tumbling downe. âThose who delight in climbing high, âOft by a precipice do dye, So do the Starres skie-climbing worldlings flout; But this disease is fatall to a Crowne: Kings, who have most, would most augment their bounds, And if they be not all, they cannot be, Which to their damage commonly redounds, âThe weight of too great states themselves confounds. âThe mighty toyling to enlarge their state, âThemselves exceedingly deceive, âIn hazarding the thing they have âFor a felicity which they conceive; âThough their Dominions they encrease, âYet their desires grow never lesse, âFor though they conquer much, yet more they crave, âWhich fatall Fortune doth attend the great, âAnd all the outward pompe that they assume âDoth but with shows disguise the Minds distresse; âAnd who to conquer all the earth presume, âA little earth shall them at last consume. And if it fortune that they dye in peace, (A wonder wondrous rarely seene) Who conquer first, heavens finde a meane To raze their Empire, and oft-times their race, Who comming to the Crowne with rest, And having all in peace possest, Do straight forget what bloudy broyles have beene, Ere first their Fathers could attaine that place; âAs Seas do flow and ebbe, States rise, and fall, âAnd Princes when their actions prosper best, âFor feare their greatnesse should oppresse the small, âAs of some hated, envied are of all. We know what end the mighty Cyrus made, Whom whil'st he striv'd to conquer still, A woman (justly griev'd) did kill, And in a bloudy vessell roll'd his head, Then said (whil'st many wondring stood) Since thou didst famish for such food, Now quench thy thirst of bloud with bloud at will; Some who succeeded him, since he was dead, Have raign'd a space with pompe, and yet with paine, Whose glory now can do to us no good; And what so long they labour'd to obtaine, All in an instant must be lost againe. Loe, Darius once so magnified by fame, By one whom he contemn'd o're-come, For all his bravery now made dombe, With down-cast eyes must signifie his shame; Who puft up with ostentive pride, Thinke Fortune bound to serve their side, Can never scape, to be the prey of some; Such spend their prosp'rous dayes, as in a dreame, And as it were in Fortunes bosome sleeping, Then in a dull security abide, And of their doubtfull state neglect the keeping, Whil'st fearfull ruine comes upon them creeping. Thus the vicissitude of worldly things Doth oft to us it selfe detect, When heavenly pow'rs exalt, deject, Confirme, confound, erect, and ruine Kings. So Alexander mighty now, To whom the vanquish'd world doth bow, With all submission, homage, and respect, Doth flie a borrow'd flight with Fortunes wings; Nor enters he his dangerous course to ponder; Yet if once Fortune bend her cloudy brow, All those who at his sudden successe wonder, May gaze as much to see himselfe brought under.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scene I. Sisigambis, Statira, Regina Statira virgo. O dismall day detested be thy light, And would the Gods (but Gods neglect our case) The world were wrapt in a Cymmerian Night, That no proud eye might gaze on our disgrace. Why did the Heavens reserve my feeble age To make my burden more, when strength grows lesse? Could nothing but my harmes their wrath asswage, Thus offred up on th'Altar of distresse? Ah! have I spent my youth in pompe, and pleasure, And had my spring-time grac'd with pleasant flowres That th'Autumne which should reape the Sommers treasure Might be distempred with such stormy showres? And did smooth calmes and Sunne-shines for a space, Make all my voyage through the world a sport, That I should fall when neere to end my race, (And toss'd with stormes) even perish at my port? Yet for all this, were I expos'd alone, The wretched object of Ioves thund'ring armes, I should not thinke I had just cause to mone, When I but wail'd mine owne, not others harmes; Ah me! on those whom more then life I love The state-disturbing blasts of Fortune fall, Yet each of them some severall losse doth move, But I in anguish beare a part with all: I suffred when I saw Oxatres slaine, My loving Sonne, and most entirely lov'd; I dy'd in Darius, when he try'd in vaine What Fates would do, yet still their hatred prov'd; The heavens to plague me more, yet make me breath, O rigour rare! what tortures rack my breast? Who feele the sowre; but not the sweet of death, Still cours'd, not kill'd, lest that should breed me rest; Yet, Iove, if this may dis-enflame thine ire, Let all thy lightning light upon my head, To be consum'd with a celestiall fire, Some comfort were, since that I must be dead. Sta. Reg. Leave mother those complaints, as fit for me, Who still must grieve my friends, and grace my foes: Whose fortune is so wretched still to be, That all the world may wonder at my woes. Loe, that deare Lord and treasure of my thought, Whose presence I my Paradise esteem'd, To such a precipice is headlong brought, That he from ruine cannot be redeem'd; Ah! on what prop can I repose my trust, When of his state I first the greatnesse ponder? Next, how his Diademe (drencht in the dust) Was Fortunes Trophee, and all Asia's wonder? He whose imperious speech the world respected, And as an Oracle had in regard, He vanquish'd now, and with contempt neglected, (Even as a supplicant) can scarce be heard; And yet I know this more doth grieve his soule Then all the harme which happ'ned to his state, His pow'r ov'r me that any can controull, Who (as his Idoll) was ador'd of late; Shall he (pure quintessence of my best part) Then onely testifie the love he beares? No, by mine eyes I will distill my heart, And for his sake dissolve my selfe in teares; Would God my breast might still transparant be, That as through Crystall all might marke my minde, And of my loyall thoughts the secrets see, Whose great affection cannot be confin'd. This prisons worst hath bounded but mine eyes, And banish'd them the object of their joy, My fiery heart well wing'd with fancies flyes, And where thou go'st dost still thy steps convoy; Deare, whil'st thou dost enjoy this common ayre, Those who me captive thinke, do grosly erre: For whil'st thou liv'st, how can thy Queene despaire, Whom thou to soule, and Scepter, dost preferre; Yet flatter I my selfe who am accurst? Of those mishaps which make my thoughts to stray, The memory may serve to make me burst, Ah, ah, I faint, I feele my sprits decay. Sis. Help, help, alas, alas the Empresse falls. Stat. Vir. O day of darknesse! what a world of woes? Sis. This heavy sight my panting heart appals: Heaven, earth, and all, are now become our foes. Stat. Vir. No creature hath more cause to mone then I, Whose Fathers Fortune oft afflicts mine eares, Whil'st I my mothers misery must spie, So that of both my breast the burden beares. Stat. Reg. What inhumane humanity is this, With such a cruell pitie to oppresse, To bring pale ghosts back from the fields of blisse, Yet to be plung'd in th'ocean of distresse? O unkinde kindnesse that by saving slayes, And would with lovelesse love, my love controull? Ah! of this braving Sunne the loathsome rayes Do cleare mine eyes, but to confound my soule. Sis. Deare daughter, strive your passions to restraine, Lest that the torrent of your griefe grow such, That both it carry you where horrours raigne; And him o're-whelme for whom you mourn so much; No doubt but he, if we rest captives thus Disdaining those indignities of ours, To venge himselfe in reobtaining us, Will hazard all his orientall pow'rs; But ah, what comfort can a wretch afford, Whose care-worne breast the worst of woe containes? Yet though my heart would faine impugne my word, I hopelesse speake of hope, to ease her paines. Stat. Reg. Plagu'd with what is, what may be never pause, Since we must hold our griefe our greatest good, And do not feed false hopes, for we have cause Even to sigh out our souls, and weep our bloud. Sis. I waile my Sonne. Stat. Reg. And I my husbands fall. Stat. Vir. I waile my Father, and in him us all. Sis. No woe like mine, mine cannot be releev'd, I waile his woe who should my woe asswage, Who lives by me, by whom I should have liv'd, Sport of my youth, and pillar of mine age. Stat. Reg. No woe like mine, who for my Mate mourne here, For love of whom, I had all others left; But what a Mate? my selfe, or one more deare, Yet from my selfe, my selfe by force am reft. Stat. Vir. No woe like mine, who born a Monarchs childe, Hop'd by my birth of Fortunes best to boast, Yet are my hopes even at the height beguil'd, And what I hop'd in most, hath harm'd me most. Sis. I mourne for him who in my wombe was form'd. Stat. Reg. I mourn for him in whom love me transform'd. Stat. Vir. I mourn for him who did give forme to me. Sis. Shall I no more in him my Image see? Stat. Reg. Ah! shall I never in his joy rejoyce? Stat. Vir. Ah! shall I never heare his chearfull voyce? Sis. Would God my ruine might his ransome be. Stat. Reg. Would God my life my lifes life might set free. Stat. Vir. Would God the life he gave him life might give. Sis. Must those gray haires my Sonnes greene youth survive? Stat. Reg. Lest twise made dye, I'le first prevent his fall. Stat. Vir. Shall I live last to suffer for you all? Sis. But whil'st our wretched state we justly mone, We may lament this Infant too a space, Who in mishap inferiour were to none, If he could apprehend his Tragicke case. Stat. Reg. O then how can my heart but bursted be, Whom Nature moves most to bemone his harmes? I thinke the hosts of heaven I thund'ring see On me, my husband, and him in my armes: Deare Image of my selfe, in whom I live, Thy shape not shames the greatnesse of thy Sire, But of thy birth cleare evidence doth give, Thy sowre-sweet sight addes coals to my desire. Thou who should'st comfort most, torment'st thou me? Huge hosts of passions now my soule assembles; O how I grieve, and yet am glad to see Thee, though not him, whom thy sweet face resembles! Go beare this Babe from hence, a wound too deep Hath pierc'd me with compassion of his part, Yet let him stay, I joy to heare him weep; This mothers passion melts my bursting heart; Of many woes this last is not the least, That unbegun thy glory thus must end: Thy Fortunes Sunne (my Sonne) set in the East, Whil'st all the world thy rising did attend; Ah! must this Innocent taste of mishap, Whose tender age cannot discerne his state, And thus be plagu'd, yea, in his Nurses lap, Inherit woe by birth? ah cruell fate! If thou could'st hope, what great hopes hast thou lost Who art defrauded of so high a Throne? Ah! in thy cradle must I see thee crost Whom I design'd so great when we were gone? Yet happie haplesse childe, who can'st not know From whence the fountaine of our sorrow flows, Nor what it is that men call high, or low, Nor on what thorne the rose of honour grows. Yet hast thou felt the pricke before the smell; Is this the benefit thy birth-right brings, A captive here in misery to dwell? Then better not be borne, nor come of Kings. O! what a noise is this that thus affrights? I thinke of teares the torrent to restraine, (Since soules when sad a just complaint delights) They still would plague, yet stop me to complaine; Or is it one who doth lament our case, And is (a rare thing) in affliction kinde? Who would behold how we can death embrace! Death soveraigne physicke for a troubled minde. Sis. By many signes we may our selves assure T'is Alexander whom we long'd not for. Stat. Reg. What? ah I die, and must mine eyes endure That hatefull object which I most abhorre? Sis. Spare, spare such speeches now, lest all go wrong, We are environ'd with outragious hosts; Those who are weake must yeeld unto the strong: For, Victors rage when as the vanquish'd bosts; I will entreat him too, not for my selfe (Age bows my body to embrace pale death) But that you yet may shunne this wrackfull shelfe, Whose youth and beauty worthy are of breath. Scene 2. Alexander, Sisigambis, Statira Regina, Hephestion. Rise Mother, rise, and calme those needlesse cares, I come to cure, not to procure your woe; The duty which I owe those silver haires, Doth grieve my minde to see you humbled so. Sis. Most gracious Prince, forgive me if I err'd In taking him for you, who stands you by. Alex. I finde no fault to see my friend preferr'd, Even to my selfe; this is another I. Sis. My sorrows so confounded have my minde That scarce I know my selfe, another lesse; My soule in such an agony I finde, As words, nor teares, nor grones cannot expresse. Alex. I pray you mother set those plaints apart, They vex me more then sterne Bellona's broils. Sis. This tender name of Mother wounds my heart, Whil'st nam'd by him, who of that name me spoils: I was (woe that I was) a Mother late Of two faire Sonnes (faire Sunnes) lights of my life, But one is dead, and in a worse estate, The other lives, involv'd in woe, and strife; Like to the trunke of some disbranched tree Which Ãolus hath to confusion brought, Since spoil'd of those brave Impes which sprung from me Unprofitable stock, I serve for nought. Stat. Reg. I serve for nought, since serving him no more, Who onely may my blasted hopes revive, Loe (quite confounded) farre from what before, Who him of me, me of my selfe deprive. I live without my halfe, without my whole, Prodigious Monster, whom the world admires, I want the point, the pilot, and the pole Which drew, addrest, and bounded my desires: Toss'd by sad sighs in flouds of bitter teares, I (save from ruine) look for no reliefe, By what I feele still plagu'd, but worse with feares, All comfort loath'd, my glory is my griefe: My soule seemes to presage disastrous chances, And warring with it selfe hath never peace, My heart surcharg'd doth faint in deadly trances, My eyes must grace the ground of my disgrace. Hell hath assembled all her horrours here; Ah! in the dungeons of this desp'rate brest, As in the dark Tartarian groves, appeare A thousand shadows to bereave my rest. Alex. Faire Princesse, spare those passionate complaints, Which may augment, but not amend your harmes; This voice which with your woe the world acquaints, Doth move me more then all the Persians Armes. Take courage (Madam) be afraid of none: That you may hope what help I can afford, I sweare by Ioves inviolable Throne, And do protest by my Imperiall word; Though for a while barr'd from your royall seat, You compass'd here with troups of strangers stand, Yet shall you still be us'd as fits your state, And may (as earst in your owne Court) command. Stat. Reg. Ah! how can I command whil'st I am thrall? What can I have, who wanting one, want all? Alex. Though brave it seeme in some proud victors sight, To plague their captives, and triumph in ill: The larger grow the limits of my might, The more I labour to restraine my will. What can be fear'd by them whom I defend? Foes have not pow'r, and who with me remaine, They dare not wrong, nor offer to offend The least in ranke who doth attend your traine; If any would impugne what I appoint, Or would in ambush for your honour lye, Or discontent you but in any point, As Alexander lives, that wretch shall dye. Stat. Reg. O what an host of evils where ere I go Are still encroaching to o're-throw my state? Ah! must I be beholding to my foe, And owe him love, to whom my love owes hate? Should he help me who still his ruine plyes? Heavens curse my heart, if stain'd with treason thus, Let death in darknesse first entombe mine eyes, Ere such a sight accepted be by us. I (Lord) am thine, and thine I will remaine, Thy love was planted in a fertile field, Which gratefull now thee to reward againe From flourish'd faith chast flames for fruits doth yeeld; Yet doth misfortune this good fortune bring, My constancy shall now be clearly knowne; Another might have lov'd an happie King: But I will love thee, though thou be o're-throwne. Alex. I labour much to comfort in some measure This grieved Queene, that was a Monarch's choice, Whose woe doth make my victory no pleasure, For whil'st she mournes, I cannot well rejoyce. Sis. Most mighty King thou dost deserve indeed, That (as for Darius) we should pray for thee, Who do'st so much in clemency exceed, That thou bewail'st our losse, no lesse then he; Not onely thou surmount'st all other Kings, In glory rising from thy labours gone; And for those benefits which Fortune brings, But in all vertues worthy of a Throne; Thou do'st vouchsafe on me (more then I crave) The title of a Queene, and Mother still, But I confesse my selfe thy humble slave, Whose life hath now no limits but thy will: The dreamed good, that Greatnesse gave, forgot, My count'nance shall be free from clouds of cares, And I'le allow of this my present lot, As one who for my fate my force prepares; Yea, if this wofull woman here were free, Who hath no heaven except her husbands face; I could content my selfe (great Prince) to be The meanest hand-mayd that attends your Grace. Alex. As if your Sonnes, command all that is mine, And I will seek to second your desire. Sis. Heavens recompense this courtesie of thine, Which in all ages thousands shall admire. Alex. Those captiv'd Princesses have pierc'd my soul, Which even amid'st our heaven, have found a hell. Hep. His passions so what Stoick could controull, Whom now to weep, their teares would not compell? What age could earst such stately beauties show, Which of perfection hold the highest place, And borne to bring, though now they be brought low, Do Beauty beautifie, give Griefe a grace? Sir, such a victory hath not beene seene As you have gain'd, since conquering (as appeares) The largest kingdome, and the fairest Queene, That Asia vaunted of, these many yeares. Durst Leda's, or Agenors brood compare With that sweet Queene, the honour of her kinde? But as she is above all others faire, As farre her daughters make her go behinde; It seem'd at first that sorrow had beene sleeping, Then whil'st those Virgins in their Grand-dames bosome, With weeping beauty, and with beauteous weeping, Did with a haile of pearle, blast Beauties blossome: So large a pow'r, no Prince on Earth can have, As hath Loves Empire in their face confin'd. Alex. What, what, Hephestion, what doth thee deceive? Dare folly seeke to bragge so brave a minde? Dare Cupid enter in an armed Camp, And them who Mars have match'd for sport appall? Must his soft seale even through hard metall stamp, And make who conquer men, to women thrall? Hep. We dare resist (whilst many a thousand dyes) The steely tempests of a world of men, But if from yvorie orbes two Sunnie eyes Do charge the soule (I know not how) O then A secret pow'r (compos'd of hopes and feares) So charms the minde, that it strange thoughts conceives, And straight the heart (quaff'd drunke by th'eyes and th'eares) Doth staggring reele, and full of fancies raves. Alex. But yet, in my conceit, I scorne all such, And do disdaine to yeeld my selfe at all; Yea, in that sort to bow I loath so much, Let rather Mars then Cupid make me fall: Should I be bound with fraile affections chains, As one oblivious of my former fame? No, no, this purpose still my soule retaines, To ballance nothing with a noble name; O! what a great indignity is this? To see a Conquerour to his lust a slave! âWho would the title of true worth were his, âMust vanquish vice, and no base thoughts conceive: âThe bravest Trophee ever man obtain'd âIs that, which ov'r himselfe, himselfe hath gain'd. Hep. I'm glad (my Soveraigne) that as you excell, Not onely men, but Mars himselfe in armes, That from your minde, you likewise may repell The flatt'ring pow'r of loves alluring charmes, That vertue rare, whose rayes shine in your words, With generous ardour doth enflame my soule, And o're my selfe to me such pow'r affords, That some brave deeds must straight this course controule. Scene 3. Bessus, Narbazanes. Narbazanes, now ere the time be gone, Let us accomplish that which we intend, And joyne our wit, our force, and all in one; (Ere known begun) that it may quickly end: You see th'occasion (if our course we keepe) To raise rare fortunes, points us out the way, Yea, blames our sluggishnesse that as a sleepe, So great a purpose doe so long delay. Loe, angry Iove our Princes part disproves: For, Fortunes worst what ever he attempt From following him, the peoples minde removes: âDistresse still is attended by contempt, A ground for so great hopes who ere did see, As heavens so happily breed in our mind, For, since our King confounded is to be, We by his fall, a meanes to rise may finde. Nar. I will most willingly performe my part, For, I the same exceedingly allow: Deare wealth and honour, Idols of my heart, If you I may enjoy, I care not how; Yet that this course may best be kept obscure, Our care must seeme all for our Country bent; âWhen mask'd with zeale, crimes are reputed pure, âA shew of good doth vulgar mindes content, âIn dangerous plots where courage joynes with Art, âLet slow advice, a quicke dispatch be us'd: âWhat can (save successe) justifie our part, âWho must command, or come to be accus'd? Bes. To Alexander one was sent of late, To speake of peace, whose speech was spent in vaine, So that (thus toss'd) most desp'rate is his state, Who peace cannot obtaine, nor warre maintaine; To cleare his thoughts which many doubts doe sway. He now craves each mans minde who squadrons leads; This for our purpose must prepare the way: âThose who would compasse Kings, need crafty heads: And that to gaine which we so much esteeme, We can upon no meanes more safe conclude, Then crooked counsels that doe upright seeme To maske our selves, and others to delude; He must (advis'd by some) renounce a space The shew of pow'r, and from affaires retire, That for a fashion one may use his place, Not as usurp'd, but at his owne desire: So may he try if others can bring backe That which his fortunes ebbe hath borne away, Then he againe his Diadem shall take, And (as before) the regall Scepter sway. Nar. Well, then amongst our selves to flye debate, Which such great actions oft-times under-mines, I yeeld that you possesse the highest seat, And will my faction frame for our designes. Bes. All that is one, which of us two receive it, Since every thing doth equally belong us, I'le take it for the forme, 'tis one who have it, For we will part his kingdomes all among us. But if he condescend to this we crave, To judgements rash, which would at first seeme good, Let him not thinke us two such fooles to leave, That which so many else have bought with bloud; âWho once advanc'd, would willingly goe downe, âAnd (prop'd with pow'r,) not love in state to stand? âThis not the custome is to quite a Crowne, âWhen one hath knowne how sweet it's to command; âThis name of faith but to get credit fain'd, âIs (weigh'd with kingdomes) lighter then a Crowne, âAnd even in them whose thoughts are most restrain'd, âA Scepters weight would presse all goodnesse down. Nar. Yet of my thoughts some doubt new counsell claimes, And with huge horrour aggravates disgrace: The staine of treason still attends our names, And with our errour burdens all our race; Our purpose must accomplish'd be with paine, And we (though pompe a space appease our soules) Shall finde afflictions to disturbe our raigne, And be when dead, defam'd by famous scroules, The sacred title of a Soveraigne King Doth worke a terrour more then can be thought, And Majestie to brave my minde doth bring, Whose count'nance only strange effects hath wrought. Bes. To idle sounds and frivolous reports, Give straight a pasport, for they last not long, And what thou do'st alledge, not much imports: âA Crowne may cover any kinde of wrong; âWhat hainous thing so odious is by nature, âWhich for a Kingdome not committed is? âTo be a King, let me be call'd a traitour, âFaith (if for ought) may broken be for this. âThose are but feeble braines which fancies loade, âWith timorous dreams which bare surmising brings; âWho feare vaine shadowes, must not walke abroad, âToo warie wits dare never worke great things. If our brave project happily succeed, (As now I doubt not but it shall doe soone) We straight will numbers finde to praise our deed, And sooth us up in all that we have done. Nar. Now that the time and manner may be sure, The Bactrian bands shall all attend in Armes, Yet faine a cause that he may live secure, And be surpris'd not looking for alarmes. Then through the campe a rumour must be spread, That hopelesse Darius hath despair'dly gone, By violence to dwell amongst the dead, Which (as much griev'd) we must appeare to mone: The Persians may with promises be pleas'd, So to disarme him of his native pow'rs, Then taking him, our thoughts may all be eas'd, For whil'st he is his owne, we are not ours; Till strong with titles, we with pow'r command, His shadow shrouds, while rights are forc'd, or fain'd, And his to daunt, or strangers to gaine-stand, To raise our state, his shew must be maintain'd. To Alexander after we will send, And offer him his foe to bondage brought, Then crave that us his favour may defend, As those who all things for his good have wrought; Then if we thus his grace cannot procure, But that he us with rigour doe pursue, With Darius death we will our states assure, Then first our force, and next the warres renue. Bes. Let us hence-forth for nothing be dismaid, But strive our selves couragiously to beare. This dangerous action would not be delay'd, Least time make him to doubt, and us to feare. Exeunt. Chorus. Time, through Ioves judgement just, Huge alterations brings: Those are but fooles who trust In transitory things, Whose tailes beare mortall stings, Which in the end will wound; And let none thinke it strange, Though all things earthly change: In this inferiour round What is from ruine free? The Elements which be At variance (as we see) Each th'other doth confound: The Earth and Ayre make warre, The fire and water are Still wrestling at debate, All those through cold and heat, Through drought and moisture jarre. What wonder though men change and fade, Who of those changing Elements are made? How dare vaine worldlings vaunt Of fortunes goods not lasting, Evils which our wits enchant? Expos'd to losse and wasting! Loe, we to death are hasting, Whil'st we those things discusse: All things from their beginning, Still to an end are running, Heaven hath ordain'd it thus; We heare how it doth thunder, We see th'earth barst asunder, And yet we never ponder What this imports to us: Those fearefull signes doe prove, That th' angry pow'rs above Are mov'd to indignation Against this wretched nation, Which they no longer love: What are we but a passe of breath Who live assur'd of nothing but of death? Who was so happy yet As never had some crosse? Though on a Throne he sit, And is not us'd with losse, Yet fortune once will tosse Him, when that least he would; If one had all at once Hydaspes precious stones, And yellow Tagus gold; The Orientall treasure, And every earthly pleasure, Even in the greatest measure, It should not make him bold: For while he lives secure, His state is most unsure; When it doth least appeare, Some heavy plague drawes neare, Destruction to procure. Worlds glory is but like a flowre, Which both is bloom'd, and blasted in an houre. In what we most repose, We finde our comfort light, The thing we soonest lose That's pretious in our sight; For honour, riches, might, Our lives in pawne we lay; Yet all like flying shadowes, Or flowers enamelling meadowes, Doe vanish and decay. Long time we toile to finde Those Idols of the minde, Which had, we cannot binde To bide with us one day: Then why should we presume On treasures that consume, Difficult to obtaine, Difficult to retaine, A dreame, a breath, a fume? Which vexe them most, that them possesse, Who starve with store, and famish with excesse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 4. Scene I. Darius, Tiriotes. Ah! must I poyson now my Princes eares, With newes the worst that ever burden'd fame? Had I as many tongues as I have teares, All would not serve my sorrowes to proclaime. Dar. Great signes of griefe I in thy face discerne, And spare not to report this heavie crosse To one (I feare) whom it doth most concerne: Is't death, disgrace, destruction, treason, losse? Tell on the summe of horrour at the first; With no ambiguous words my paine prolong: âA wretch for comfort craves to know the worst, And I have learn'd to be unhappy long; What least I speake, and yet suspect too much, Art thou the Trumpet to proclaime my scorne Which must wound me? (but ah) no torment such As this to her who that disgrace hath borne. Tir. She was not wrong'd, as you have wrong conceiv'd; The Gods from harme did study to preserve her; She from your foe such favour hath receiv'd, As from her Subjects who were bound to serve her; But what a volly doth my voyce prepare Of woes to charge your eares? woes full of dread, Would God ere I my message can declare, That I may dye in saying she is dead. And was it not enough (poore wretch alas) That I beheld her dye, and would have dy'd? But that I must (arm'd with sad tidings) passe To wound all them who heare what I have spy'd? See how he stands (mov'd with those words of mine,) As if by griefe arrested unto death. Dar. Yet doth the Sunne on my affliction shine, And cleare the ayre though tainted by my breath? And can I live, and looke them in the face, Who have my o'rethrow (shamefull o'rethrow) scene? And how I vanquish'd, vanquish'd with disgrace, Did lose at once my Kingdome and my Queene? Heaven bruise me all to powder with thy thunder, That I no more may in the world remaine The object of thy wrath, and fortunes wonder, Spoil'd of all hope, yet kept for greater paine. Ah, art thou dead? and doe I live behinde thee? Thy faulty husband, think'st thou so to flye? If it be thus, then know I where to finde thee, This onely grieves me that too late I dye. O Alexander, what such hainous ill Have I done thee, that thou requit'st me thus? Whom of thy friends or kindred did I kill? This cruelty comes undeserv'd of us, Though justly thou intended had this warre, Mars from his rage made women alwaies free, This tyranny shall all thy Trophees marre, And still to thy reproch reported be. Tir. Thus of that Prince, you without cause esteeme, I know her death him grievously displeas'd, A wondrous thing which few or none would deeme, He wail'd it long, and could not be appeas'd. Even as my Soveraigne now, then did he smart, And when he came to calme your mothers griefe, As acting not his owne, but even your part, He seem'd to need, and not to give reliefe. Dar. If any sparkes of that respect remaine, Which much with thee should (duely weigh'd) import, I pray thee (Tiriotes) now be plaine, Or else strange torments shall the truth extort; I loath to let this question scape my mouth, Which both I blush to crave, and long to know, And can it be, that this transported youth Not urg'd to have that which I onely owe? Could this fierce Prince even in his flaming age, Have such a beauty purchas'd by his toiles, And yet not seeke (forc'd by affections rage) Her honours ruine, and my pleasures spoiles? Speake frankely now, and tell what fatall shelfe Hath crush'd my treasures Barke, and me defac'd: The feare of ill is worse then ill it selfe; âThey twise doe dye, who dye, and dye disgrac'd. Tir. Let not those love-bred feares abuse your thought; By all the world no fable I contrive; If partially I speake, or lye in ought, Earth open wide, and swallow me alive: He whom your grace so wrongfully suspects, Hath not in any sort your Queene abus'd, But as his sister still (in all respects) As chastly and as honourably us'd; When angry Iove subverted had our state, And view'd our thundred troupes disordered flight, Light fortune then who flattered us of late, Did make our state a mirrour of her might, For, having found a Crowne foil'd on the ground. Dar. O endlesse shame which never can be cur'd! Tir. We straight imagin'd that some cruell wound Had kill'd our Lord, and wail'd it as assur'd. Dar. Would God I then had dy'd, as I desir'd, To have prevented those ensuing harmes, Whil'st ere my honour and my hap expir'd, A Crowne my head, a Queene enrich'd my armes. Tir. But Alexander having heard our cryes, Sent one to learne the cause that mov'd our woe; Who finding whence our errour did arise, Gave full assurance that it was not so. Then he himselfe did to our Tent resort, And with the mildest words he could conceive, Your Mother, Wife, and Children did exhort Such terrours vaine (since but surmiz'd) to leave; And he protested that they should expect No harme of him their courage to appall, Then all things did with great regard direct, That no man might endammage them at all. Thus when they were against all dangers arm'd, (I thinke, for feare (for who would not have fear'd?) Lest such rare graces might his minde have charm'd) He never more before her face appear'd; Else generous vertue, jealous of each thing, Which (tempting reason) senses might allure, (What rare restraint in a victorious King) He fled what fault, or scandall could procure. He doth his fame above all things preferre, And will not be where it may blemish finde, Nor give his eyes commodity to erre, Lest thoughts impure might strive to staine his minde. He whil'st that she was sicke, did loath delight, And (gravely griev'd) all pompe and pleasure left. Dar. O hatefull heaven! that with such hellish spight The worlds chiefe treasure, Natures glory reft. Tir. When he beheld deaths triumph in that face, Which had triumph'd o're such a Monarchs heart, With witness'd woe, even passionate a space, The lookers on did much commend his part; And when some time his dolour had o're-come, Her funerall rites solemnly to decore, He us'd such honour, as might well become The Persian pompe in prosp'rous times before. Dar. O pow'r supreame! that of great states disposest, And ratifi'st thy will with fearefull thunder, Who as thou pleasest, placest, and deposest Vncertaine worldlings, now above, now under: I pray thy Deitie in my soules distresse, If that th'inhabitants of heaven can heare The plaints of them who this low point possesse, Or that th' immortals can give mortals eare, This favour last I onely doe require, Establish first the Scepter in my hand; But if through my desert, or thy desire, The race of Cyrus must no more command, Since angry heaven so high a hate contracts, That I must needs my Diadem forgoe, Let him succeed, who proves in all his acts, So milde a Victor, and so just a foe. Scene 2. Darius, Artabazus, Nabarzanes, Patron, Bessus. If joyn'd by fates with men of dastard mindes, Who to a noble death, base life preferr'd, I should not waste my words amongst the windes, But labour would that time might be deferr'd; Though still resolv'd, your course confirmes me much, Whom no disaster could divorce from me, What man can doubt whom heavens doe backe by such, When (bragg'd with bondage) fighting to be free? My courage swels to see you marching forth, Whose force and faith, which all the world doth sing, (Oft clear'd by proofe, though fortune envy worth) Might serve to make, farre more to keepe a King. He gives our rebels Townes, not mov'd by love: âEach Prince (though using them,) all traitours hates. But that their course to take, this might you move, His turne once serv'd, so forfeiting your states. Ye to my fortune have not had regard, As of my peace, so partners of my warres, Which, though that I might not, Iove would reward, And all the world extoll you to the starres. How long shall I a vagabond remaine, And flye a stranger who my right would reave, Since by one battell we may re-obtaine All that we lost, or lose all that we have? Like some vile traitors, whom I will arraigne, To hold me up, shall I goe cast me downe? Must Darius onely by entreaty raigne? No, none hath pow'r to give, or take my Crowne. I shall not my authority survive, Nor will I proffer a submissive breath, My hand shall hold a Scepter while I live, My head shall beare a Diadem till death; If those franke thoughts which doe possesse my soule, Such flames of courage kindled have in you, A Macedonian shall not us controule, Nor with disdainefull smiles brag whil'st we bow: My state may testifie fraile fortunes change, May she not him o're-whelme, as well as mee? At least our hands beare death, if not revenge, âBrave mindes when no more rests may still dye free. Now call your valorous ancestors to minde, Who from the Grecians tribute still requir'd, And of whose deeds rare monuments we finde, Whose merits make their memories admir'd; Shall of your deeds, posterity be dumbe, Which doth your fathers names (though dead) adore? I am resolv'd, my triumph, or my tombe, A Laurell, or a Cypresse shall decore. Art. What doubtfull silence thus your thoughts detaines? We need advise with nought but with our swords; He who the Persians wonted worth retaines, Will answer now with deeds, and not with words. Let us accompany our King in Armes, Through bloudy squadrons to this fatall strife: âNo profit can be had without some harmes, By slaughter onely we must looke for life; And when our host (as I hope) doth prevaile, Our Country shall have peace, we praise of right; And if our fortune (not our courage) faile, We dye with honour in our Soveraignes sight; Let us (if vanquish'd) scorne base breath to buy, A noble death may greater glory give, Doe to o're-come, and yet not feare to dye: 'Tis needfull that we fight, not that we live. Nar. My words will first your Majestie displease, Yet duty makes me speake where silence spilles; âThe best Physitian cures a sharpe disease, âWith some sowre potion that corruption killes; âAnd skilfull Pilots when they feare a storme, âTo save the ship, will cast out pretious things, You in some sort may imitate their forme, For else a tempest totall ruine brings. Since bent against the Gods, how can we speed? To all our actions, fortune is oppos'd, We must of force some other way proceed, So have the heavens of our affaires dispos'd: Give (Sir,) the state, at least your titles place On some more happy man, not in effect, But with your shadow cloath him for a space, Till he your Realmes from ruine may protect. This storme once calm'd, that now disturbes your state, And Asia free from any forraigne hoste, He shall with haste resigne the Soveraigne seat, These Kingdoms gain'd againe, which you have lost: All Bactria yet abides at your command, The Indians, loe, would dye to doe you good, Yea, many thousand thousands armed stand, Bent for your State to offer up their bloud; What? should we rush like beasts to needlesse strife? Be well prepar'd, and then your fortune try, âBrave mindes should death despise, not loathing life: âFor feare of danger cowards crave to dye. âBut vertue first all hopes accounts doth cast, âAnd of each meane to helpe maturely thinkes, âThen, when all else is done, death is the last, âThe which to meet true courage never shrinkes. Now for the time, let Bactria be our seate, To Bessus for the forme your Growne resigne, Who, when he once hath re-advanc'd your state, Shall with your foes o'rethrow his charge confine. Dar. Wretch travell'st thou thy Soveraign to betray? Such treason dar'st thou to our eares impart? Such treason under trust? stay traitour stay, My sword shall search what lurkes within thy heart. Art. Sir, reyne your rage: this but new trouble breeds; And weigh well what they are, what is the time; It may be this from ignorance proceeds, âIn thought, and not in word, consists a crime; Since that against your enemies you goe, Be not severe in cens'ring Subjects parts, But tolerate your owne, to grieve your foe, Now must we strive to gaine, not lose mens hearts. It by all meanes shall be exactly try'd, How first his braine such fancies did embrace, And if but simply, not puft up with pride, He must be pardon'd, and restor'd to grace. Dar. And of my Subjects I would rather have Then one to punish, them to guerdon all. Nar. If I have err'd, no pardon (Sir) I crave. First heare, and if I faile, then let me fall; I call the Gods to testifie my part, Who can (commenting thoughts) cleare truth afford. If ever treason harbour'd in my heart, Straight let me dye, not pittied, but abhorr'd; I counsell gave according to my skill, It was my upright minde that made me bold, And though my wit not answer'd to my will, âStill zeale what it conceives, must needs unfold. âWe should be loth to speake in great affaires, âWhere words are damn'd, or ballanc'd by th' event: âFor, if things faile, the fault is still thought theirs, âWho gave advice, though of a good intent, Great Prince forget this not well grounded grudge: Who dare be free if thus for words rejected? At least examine first before you judge, I rather dye absolv'd; then live suspected. Dar. Your fond opinion justly might be fear'd, Which seem'd indeed sinistrously inclind; For, at the first your speech to me appear'd The poyson'd birth of some malitious minde. But your purgation now hath taken place, And of your faith I will no further doubt, But hold you in the same degree of grace, That you enjoy'd, before those words chanc'd out: I thinke that Patron lookes with speaking eyes, As if his minde were mightily perplex'd, Come, Patron, tell what in thy bosome lyes, By which thou seem'st so wonderfully vex'd. Pa. Sir, I would speake in private if I could, That which affection fir'd with zeale affords, âLet silence seale what friends with feare unfold, Take you my thoughts, none else shall have my words: Though onely bound by voluntary choice, We follow you (all other hopes quite lost) Your bodies shadowes, th' Ecchoes of your voyce, As faithfull now as when you flourish'd most; For where you are, we must remaine with you, Since both our lots are in one vessell throwne, I wish our Tent were made your lodging now, For, we will save your life, or lose our owne. We have abandon'd Greece our native soile, And our retreat no Bactria now attends, But those who us would of your person spoile, Spoile us of all, whose all on you depends. Would God all yours were bent to doe their due, âFame big by feare doth bring forth rumours rife; I grant it grosse, if that his owne were true, To trust a stranger with a Monarches life. Dar. What sudden danger doth of late dismay you, Such inconveniences that you fore-cast? Pa. Sir, Bessus and Narbazanes betray you, This day to you, or them will be the last: They faine repentance onely for the forme, Till every thing be for the fact prepar'd, The clouds are gathering which doe boast a storme, And they ere night, minde to invade your guard. Dar. I trust thy words, but yet I cannot wrong Those who by nature love to me should beare, Shall I leave them who follow'd me so long? Then they may thinke, I merit what I feare. I will await on what the heavens will send, For, who can stand when fates his fall conspire, And with mine owne, at least, least griev'd will end, I live too long if they my death desire. Bes. Take heed in time (Sir) to this subtile Greeke, The Grecian faith to all the world is knowne, I am enform'd he by all meanes doth seeke To gratifie your foe, as borne his owne; âAnd marvell not, though mercenary men, âWho sell themselves, sell all, this is not strange, âThey have no God but gold, nor house, how then âCan they be constant, who doe live by change? Though this vaine man pre-occupy you thus, And such as would themselves abuse your grace, Faith shall be found untainted still in us, When our accuser dare not shew his face. Dar. Of Alexander those who hope for gaine. By trait'rous meanes do but themselves deceive, Since none in earth doth Traitors more disdaine, Nor treason can in greater horrour have. Bes. Well, Sir, you shall know shortly what we are, I will go see your Ensignes all displai'd. Dar. It better is since things are gone so farre, Then seeme but to mistrust, to be betray'd. Loe, Artabazus I have acted here My part of greatnesse, and my glasse is runne, Now Patrons speech doth evident appeare, I see my end, yet can their course not shunne. Art. The Bactrians onely have imbark'd in this, Go to the Greeks, which if with courage done, When once your danger manifested is, The Persians all will follow after soone. Dar. And what if I were gone to Patrons Tent, And had the Greeks for guard as you desire? He hath but thousands foure which are well bent, They thirty thousand who my fall conspire; And (doing this) I should their deed excuse, In giving them a cause who have most might; They may indeed my lenity abuse, But by my deed they shall pretend no right. Art. O Prince to be bemoan'd, who can but weep To see thee thus involv'd in such a state? Dar. Retyre you all, and seek your selves to keep, I here attend the issue of my fate. Ye wonder that a wretch yet breathing stands, To whom the heavens no comfort can impart: Feare shall not make me fall by mine owne hands, No, let another sinne though I must smart; None of you all have falsifi'd your truth, But loyall still unto the end abide, Now I you all disburthen of your oath, Leave me alone, and for your selves provide. Scene 3. Darius. O stormy state of Kings, vaine Mortalls choice, The glorious height whence greatnesse grones to fall! Ah! we (who courting fame, do hunt each voyce) To seeme but Soveraigne must be slaves to all: âYet blowne like bladders, with Ambitions winde, âOn envy'd Scepters weakly we relye; âAnd (whil'st swoln fancies do betray the minde) âNot onely th'earth, but heavens themselves defie. âWhil'st loftie thoughts tumultuous mindes do tosse, âWhich are puft up with popular applause, âA state extended by our Neighbours losse, âFor further trouble but procures a cause; âIf Fortunes dark ecclipse cloud glories light, âThen what avails that pomp which pride doth claim? âA meere illusion made to mock the sight, âWhose best was but the shadow of a dreame; âOf glassie Scepters, let fraile greatnesse vaunt, âNot Scepters, no, but reeds, which (rais'd up) break, âAnd let eye-flatt'ring shows our wits enchaunt, âAll perish'd are, ere of their pomp men speak, âThose golden palaces, those gorgeous Halls, âWith furniture superfluously faire, âThose stately Courts, those skie-encountring walls âDo vanish all like vapours in the ayre. âO! what affliction jealous greatnesse beares, âWhich still must travell to hold others downe, âWhil'st all our guards not guard us from our fears, âSuch toile attends the glory of a Crowne? Where are they all who at my feet did bow, Whil'st I was made the Idoll of so many? What joy had I not then? what have I now? Of all once honour'd, and now scarce of any. âOur painted pleasures but apparrell paine: âWe spend our nights in feare, our dayes in dangers, âBalls toss'd by Starres, thrals bound to Fortunes raigne, âThough known to all, yet to our selves but strangers. âA golden Crowne doth cover leaden cares; âThe Scepter cannot lull their thoughts asleep, âWhose souls are drown'd with flouds of cold despaires, âOf which base vulgars cannot sound the deep. âThe Bramble grows, although it be obscure, âWhil'st loftie Cedars feele the blust'ring windes, âAnd milde Plebeian souls may live secure, âWhile mighty tempests tosse Imperiall mindes; âWhat are our dayes but dreames, our raigne a glance, âWhil'st Fortunes feaver makes us rage and rave, âVVhich with strange fits doth to a height advance, âTill, ere paine us, we first our life must leave? âFor glist'ring greatnesse by Ambition lov'd, âI was the wonder of all gazing eyes, âBut free from shadows (reall essence prov'd) âStates just proportion ruine onely tryes. Loe, charg'd with chains which (though they be of gold) My states distresse diminish not the more, When this prepost'rous honour I behold, It but upbraids me what I was before, And what was I before (as now I see) (Though what afflicted was not clearly knowne) But still in fetters, whilst appearing free, And in a labyrinth of labours throwne. Was I not forc'd to serve a thousand humours, To scape the censure of a Criticke storie, Still clog'd with cares, enrag'd with many rumours; O glorious bondage, and Ã´ burd'nous glory! That dignity which deifi'd me late, And made the world doe homage to my name, Doth not oppose that which pursues my state, But by my fall gives feathers unto fame; My best was but a momentary blisse, Which leaves behind this ever-lasting sting, That of all woes no woe is like to this, To thinke I was, and am not now a king. No man with me in all th'accomplish'd joyes That satisfie the soule, could once compare; No man may match me now in sad annoyes, Or any crosse which can provoke despaire. Thrice fortune did my gallant troups entrap, And I to fall did desperately stand, Yet could not be so happy in mishap, As to have di'd by some renowned hand; But for my greater griefe, disgrace, and scorne (The mindes of men so apt are to deceave) They whom aloft my favours wings had borne, Even they have made their Master thus a slave. Ah! did not death in prison from me reave, The sacred Soveraigne of my soules desires? And I (wretch'd I) not present to receave, The last cold kisse that should have quench'd my fires? Yet, o thrice happie thou, who hast not liv'd To beare a burden of this great disgrace! More then a thousand deaths this had thee grievd, To know I di'd, and di'd in such a case. Ah! doe the pledges of our mutuall love, (The onely comfort that the fates have left) Rest prison'd yet? and may I not remove My mother thence, as of all power quite reft? My paines are more then with my pleasures even, Since first my head was burden'd with a Crowne; Was I exalted once up to the Heaven, That to the Center Iove might throw me downe? My ample Empire, and my Princely birth, My great magnificence, and vaine excesse, All cannot yeeld my minde one minutes mirth, To ease me now in this my great distresse. Loe here reduc'd vnto the worst of ills, Past helpe, past hope, and onely great in griefe, Two abject vassals make me waite their willes, Not looking, no, nor wishing for reliefe. If that my honour had beene first repair'd, Then what though death had this fraile fortresse wonne? I waile my life (since for disgrace prepar'd) Not that it ends, but that it was begunne: What fatall conflict can my count'nance marre, Though me to bragge, death all his horrours bring? I never shall wrong Majestie so farre, As ought to doe that not becomes a king. Chorus. Some new disaster daylie doth fore-show Our comming ruine: wee have seene our best: For, fortune bent us wholy to o'rethrow, Throwes downe our king from her wheeles height so low, That by no meanes his state can be redrest: For, since by armes his pow'r hath beene represt, Both friends and servants leave him all alone; Few have compassion of his state distrest, To him themselves a number false doth show; So foes and faithlesse friends conspir'd in one, Fraile fortune and the fates with them agree: âAll runne with Hatchets on a falling tree. This Prince in prosp'rous state hath flourish'd long, And never dream'd of ill, did thinke farre lesse, But was well follow'd whilst his state was strong; Him flattering Syrens with a charming song Striv'd to exalt, then whilst he did possesse This earthly drosse, that with a vaine excesse He might reward their mercenarie love; But now when fortune drives him to distresse, His favourites whom he remain'd among, They straight with her (as hers) their faith remove; And who for gaine to follow him were wont; They after gaine by his destruction hunt. âO more then happie ten times were that king, âWho were vnhappie but a little space, âSo that it did not utter ruine bring, âBut made him prove (a profitable thing) âWho of his traine did best deserve his grace; âThen could, and would of those the best embrace; âSuch vulturs fled as follow but for prey, âThat faithfull Servants might possesse their place. âAll gallant minds it must with anguish sting, âWhilst wanting meanes their vertue to display; âThis is the griefe which bursts a generous heart; âWhen favour comes by chance, not by desart. Those minions oft to whom kings doe extend Above their worth, immoderate good-will, (The buttes of common hate oft hit in end) In prosp'rous times they onely doe depend, Not upon them, but on their fortune still, Which if it change, they change, them though they fill Their hopes with honour, and their chests with Coyne; Yet if they fall, or their affaires goe ill, Those whom they rais'd will not with them descend, But with the side most stronge all straight doe joyne; And doe forget all what was given before, When once of them they can expect no more. The truth hereof in end this strange event, In Bessus and Narbazenes hath prov'd, On whom their Prince so prodigally spent Affection, Honour, Titles, Treasure, Rent, And all that might an honest minde have mov'd. So bountyfull a Prince still to have lov'd. Who so benignely tendred had their state; Yet Traitours vile (all due respects remov'd) They him to strike the strength he gave have bent, Soe as he now may rue, although too late, That slie Camelions changing thus their hue, To servants were preferr'd, who still were true. But though those Traitours for a space doe speed, No doubt the Heavens once vengeance will exact; The very horrour of this hainous deed, Doth make the hearts of honest men to bleed: Yea, even the wicked hate this barbarous act: The Heavens no higher choler can contract, Then for the forcing of a sacred king, Whose state (if rage doe not their mindes distract) Must feare and reverence in inferiours breed, To whom from him all what is theirs doth spring; But though on th'earth men should neglect this wrong; Heavens will those Traitours plague ere it be long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 5. Scene I. Hephestion, Alexander, Polystratus. What Story or what fable can record Of such a numb'rous troupe so strangely lost? I know they quak'd to know it was my lord, Whose name alone is worth anothers hoste: It scarse can trusted be in many parts; âBut Traitours feare, though all the world them backe, They were but bodies destitute of hearts: Moe prisoners they were then men to take. Who would believe so few durst strive to meete So great an Army, and the Army shrinkes? âBut Glories flattery, and fames sounds are sweet: âTrue valour dare attempt all that it thinkes. Alex. In this encounter to have had the best, It would content more then a common minde; But since we want the chiefe, what of the rest? I must in all a satisfaction finde; Those Traitours thought to finish thus the warre, By giving me their Lord whom they have bound, But I who march with confidence so farre Doe scorne to build upon so base a ground; To venge my wrongs dare others then designe? Since Darius was ordain'd my prey to be, How durst they but have aim'd at ought of mine? His o'rethrowes glory did belong to mee. Whilst in himselfe he onely did confide, I by all meanes did strive to make him bow, But since his hard estate abates that pride, My fury turn'd is to compassion now; Though he contemn'd me oft, and did me wrong, Yet am I griev'd that he was thus deceav'd, If but acknowledg'd once to be more strong, I not his blood, nor yet his kingdome crav'd; And if those Traytours have not kill'd him straight, Yet his delivery shall my name renowne, I would not lose a Subject of such weight, By which my clemency might be made knowne. Po. Sir, now your comming cannot doe him good. Alex. What? all are fled, none have my force withstood? Po. Yet can not Darius be redeem'd againe. Alex. Why, have they set him free, or is he slaine? Po. Now he enjoyes a libertie at last; But ransom'd is by offering up his breath. Alex. Then is all Asia's expectation past? Tell on at length the manner of his death. Po. The boiling ardor of the rising Sunne (All moisture gone) did breede so great a drouth, That from the way I had a little runne, To finde some fountaine to refresh my mouth; There, by the borders of a rysing brooke, Which shadow'd was from Titans rysing beames, From liquid crystalls I atribute tooke, Which seem'd to murmure, that I forc'd their streames: When (loe) I saw (a lamentable sight) Two wounded horses draw a bloody Coach, Which clad with skinnes, shew horrour at the height; And it to spie when as I did approach, One was within, who could not long time scape, The fatall passage of th'infernall gates; Yet Majestie triumphing o're mishap, Hee seem'd to bragge both fortune and the fates. And to so base a state as first not borne, Then whilst his bloode aboundantly did fall, He bursted forth those words in fortunes scorne, As one whose courage nothing could appall: You gaze to see (and have good cause wherefore) A man no man, a king no king: what change? Now lesse then nought who once was both, and more; This would seeme wond'rous; but no state is strange; And yet a midst my evils I must rejoyce, That this last comfort doth forgoe my end. I speake to one who can conceave my voice, And not in vaine my dying speeches spend; I am, but how? in name, and not in pow'r, That wretched Darius (which I should suppresse) Once happie (as was thought) but at this hower, A lively patterne of extreame distresse. Then having paus'd (he said) my griefe is great, Tell Alexander (as the world may spie) That though of me he never had but hate, Yet am I forc'd farre in his debt to die: The favour past extended to my Queene, And that poore remnant my surviving rest, (When weighing well what I to him have beene) I wish continu'd, but can scarse request; They to his foe belong, and yet he strives To have them honour'd now, as in times past; But those who held of me both states, and lives, Of state and life have me depriv'd at last. Entreat him too that unreveng'd below I wander not as haplesse in all things: Let men his justice, and their treason know; This (as a common cause) doth touch all kings. Beside the honour which he shall acquire In plaguing them who have betrai'd my trust, His magnanimity men shall admire, And feare to grieve him whom they finde so just. âAs watrie rounds which rise and reele in raine, âDo swell, and flote, yet when they breake (though bright) âLast, leave (when fall'n) no token save a stayne, Pompe quickly thus both courts and scornes the sight: And since my glasse is runne, my glory gone, I dead unto the world, the world to me, I wish (save his) that th'earth adore no throne: For, from his raigne what subject would be free? Then drowping downe, faint, bloodlesse, and halfe dead, He prai'd me for some water that ranne by, (A small request by such a monarch made) Which when that he had got: yet, eare I die This crosse must come (said he) to kill me quite; Though Nations once to mee as Soveraigne sought, I have not now the pow'r but to requite This little benefit, that thou hast brought: But Alexander shall reward thee well, And him the Heavens, still yeelding his desires, Since that his foes (though envie burst) must tell That courtesie which all the world admires. Now none hath pow'r his pleasure to controule, But if he use them well whom he retaines, It will procure contentment to my soule, And make him famous whilst the world remaines. When breath abandon'd hath this brittle clay, Then cause some friend defray my funerall cost, That churlish Charon force me not to stray Where darkenesse dwells, an unregarded Ghost. Last, give my corpes to her who brought it forth, Who may it with my Ancestours entombe, And since she lov'd me much, though little worth, May waile this burden which once grac'd her wombe; And to that Prince whose state I wish to stand, In signe of love which all my thoughts doe send, My soule gives him my heart, it thee my hand: Thus though I liv'd his foe, I die his friend. I had but held his hand a little space, When dying like a Torch whose waxe is spent, In spite of payne, even with a princely grace, His hands still seem'd directing as he went. Alex. Who could refraine from teares to heare declar'd The huge mishapps, which all at once did light; Have subiects slaine their Prince, whom strangers spar'd? Vs hath he fled, that perish thus he might! I for his fall am wonderfully sorry, Whom first I forc'd, but last would have maintain'd: I envie death, because it rob'd the glory Which I (by giving him his life) had gain'd. Hep. Since death hath put a period to his woes, That favour which to him you would extend, Let it with furie flame against his foes, For your designes can have no fairer end: So shall you both the peoples love obtaine, Whilst by your meanes reveng'd their Soveraigne rests, And likewise may the more securely raigne, The state well purg'd from such contagious pests, âIf but one vertue did adorne a king, âIt would be justice; many great defects âAre vail'd thereby, whereas each vertuous thing âIn one who is not just, the world suspects. Alex. Though this your Counsell, nor yet his request. Had not the pow'r to penetrate my eare, A generous stomach could not well digest, So great a wrong which courage stormes to beare. My sprite (impatient of repose) disdaines, That they so long their infamie survive: But I will punish with most grievous paines The monstrous Treason that they did contrive. What? doe they thinke (though back'd with numbrous bands) That Bactria is a bulwarke for mine Ire? Flie where they list, they cannot scape my hands, My wrath shall follow like consuming fire. Such damned soules the heaven cannot receave, Ile force Hells dungeons, as Alcides did, And they on th'earth no bounds but mine can have, I'le search them out though in the center hid, And when as threatning now I once may strike, Betwixt the bending boughs of some strong tree, To Traitours terrours who intend the like, They shall by violence dismembred be. Poll. Sir, may it please you to extend your care, That some his funerall offices performe. Alex. Goe presently, and every thing prepare, As best becomes the military forme. Scene 2. Sisigambis, Nuntius, Chorus. This looke alas, hath charg'd my soule with feares: Speak, for my life doth on thy lippes depend, Thy count'nance (ah) a dolefull copie beares Of some sad summons to denounce my end. Starve not my eares, which famish for thy words, Though they when swallow'd may but make me burst. Nun. The message (madame) which my soule affords Must once be knowne, and once knowne still accurst. Sis. Be not a niggard of ill newes. Nun. And why? Sis. Fame will tell all the world. Nun. But first to you. Sis. Tell soone. Nun. Your sonne is dead. Sis. Then let me die. Cho. Her joyes and pleasures all are perish'd now. Sis. Why opens not the Earth straight to devoure A hopelesse caitive who all good hath lost? The longer that I live, my griefe growes more, As but to mischiefe borne, kept to be crost; Would God this masse where miserie remaines, A weight of Earth from sight of men might keepe; Or that the Seas all raging through the plaines Would make my tombe amid'st their tumid deepe. O Alexander! hast thou rob'd his life, Yet entertain'd me still in hope to finde him? Why did'st thou not first kill this poore old wife, Who was not worthie to have liv'd behind him? That I should live till thou my Sonne had'st slaine, Was all thy kindnesse for this cause imploi'd? Nun. You wrong that Prince, for he with hast in vaine Came him to helpe whom others had destroi'd. Sis. What impious thoughts durst dreame so vile a deed, A monarchs murther, Asia's glories end? Nun. Two whom he rais'd did his confusion breed, He found his friend his foe, his foe a friend. Sis. Tell on thy message, messenger of death, And loade my minde with mountaines of distresse, That tears may drowne my sight, sighs choake my breath, Whilst sorrow all my sences doth possesse. Nun. When Alexander (who at peace repin'd) Did (save submission) hold all offers vaine, Bent of sterne Mars to try the doubtfull minde; A generall muster Darius did ordaine, And (in one battell bent to venture all) He caus'd his will be publikely proclaim'd, Whilst two vile Traitours did conspire his fall, Who Bessus and Narbazanes were nam'd; Those two in councell did discover first Some portion of the poison of their heart, Which caus'd the king suspect, but not the worst, Yet with a sword he sought to make them smart. But having scap'd what first was fear'd from rage, They seem'd so much their errour to lament, His indignation that they did asswage, (False hypocrits) pretending to repent. Whilst Artabazus as an honest man Who judg'd of others by his vpright minde, (No fraud conceav'd) sought more to scape then scan, What they with craft to compasse Crownes design'd. âCho. A mind sincere is ever least suspitious: âThese think all faultie, who themselves are vitious. Nun. They urg'd him with the king to interceed, That in his favour he would give them place, And did protest that by some valorous deed, They labour would to gaine againe his grace; Then Artabazus came and told the king, That in the battell he might try their faith, And both before his majestie did bring, Who (when submisse) did quickly calme his wrath. With hands stretch'd up to Heaven, and humbled knees, With teares like those which Crocodiles doe shed, Woe in their face and pitie in their eyes, Did for compassion (though from rigour) pleade. The king of nature milde did them receave, And them (who thus but for the forme complain'd) Not onely all (relenting) quite forgave; But wept in earnest too whil'st they but fain'd; When in his Coach from all suspition free, With count'nance sad long following on behinde (As still pretending supplicants to be) They bow'd to him whom they were bent to binde; The Grecian Captaine curiously neare (When mark'd a suter) crav'd what he requir'd, By pregnant proofes did evidently cleare, What treason was against his state conspir'd: He told what way their purpose might be tri'd, And how the Bactrians were for trouble bent, Then for his safety pray'd him to provide, By straight with him retyring to his Tent; But in the King who did neglect his state, No kinde of care this friendly offer bred: So that (it seem'd) he by some pow'rfull fate Was head-long forward to confusion led: The Greeke past thence despairing him to save, Who thus all meanes to help himselfe refus'd; With subtle words then Bessus there did crave To purge himselfe, and errours past excus'd; Old Artabazus happ'ning to approach, The King to him did Patrons speech report, Who then perceiv'd what danger did encroach, And wish'd he would where Greeks were strong resort. But in his breast this purpose firmly plac'd, That from his Subjects he would never flie, With mutuall teares they tenderly embrac'd, And parted there, like two who went to dye. Now silent night in pitchie vapours cled, Had must'red mysts, and march'd out of the West; (Dayes beauties darkning, shadowie horrours spread) The Sentinels were set, and all at rest, When (loe) a terrour did distract the host! Whose bands to murmure were dispers'd in parts, With sounds resembling ships in stormes neare lost, Whil'st each to other cause of feare imparts. Those who their King appointed were to guard, From what was due by fraud or feare did stray; And (to his danger having no regard) His Fortunes Minions fled with her away. The desolation then growne wondrous great, With some few Eunuchs Darius left alone, (No strength remaining, nor no signe of state) He thus them spake, who for his fall did mone: Go, part in peace ere further harme be had, Lest that my ruine likewise you surprise. They hearing those sad words (as men gone mad) Went howling through the host with dolorous cryes; So that all those who heard what plaints they made, Thought that they had their Soveraignes death bewail'd; And (forcing trust) some forg'd reports were spread, That he had kill'd himselfe, all hope quite fail'd. The Persians griev'd whil'st these things did occurre, Did first encourage all their Countrey bands To help their Prince, but yet they durst not stirre For feare of falling in the Bactrians hands; Even in the time when this confusion was, The Traitors to deferre the fact no more, Did to their Soveraignes Tent with Squadrons passe, And took, and bound, him whom they serv'd before; Who in a golden Coach once proudly rode, Was throwne in one for common carriage us'd, And who of late was honour'd like a God, Two of his owne (as if their slave) abus'd: Those royall hands to beare a Scepter borne, Were basely bound, and which the more him griev'd, â(Thus misery can hardly scape from scorne) âWith bands of gold, which burden'd, not reliev'd. When Alexander (great with courage) spy'd Our Armies flie, he (who in hope them chac'd) To follow us with diligence did ride, âBase seem'd the Conquest which no danger grac'd; But when at last at length by some inform'd How he was made a captive to his owne, At this indignity he highly storm'd, As if by it his hopes had beene o're-throwne. Out of his host he did select a few Who were best hors'd, and fit for such a fight, With whom his foes he did so fast pursue, That e're they could suspect, he came in sight; The Traitors vex'd when spying him appeare, Came to the Cart whereas the King did stay, And call'd to horse in haste, since foes were neare, Lest that they else might finde him for a prey. He look'd aloft, and cry'd aloud, I see That Nemesis is frowning from above; Should I with Traitors as a captive be? And flie from him, who but brave warres doth move? Then those in whom impiety abounds, Throw'd Darts at him (vile beasts to be abhorr'd) And hurt the horses with an hundred wounds, Then men more trusty, dying for their Lord; As false in hearts, so feeble with their hands, When Guilt and Danger doubled had despaires, The Traitors first, then all their trait'rous bands Fled from a number lesse by halfe then theirs. But to the bounds of Deaths pale kingdome brought, The King retyr'd where least by people spy'd, More wounded with ingratitude then ought, Did leave the world, whose folly he had tri'd; The last divorce which lasts, was scarcely made Twixt soule and body whil'st the eyes grew dim, When Alexander came and found him dead, Who labour'd had so long to ruine him, And (whil'st his teares a generall mourning mov'd) That stately vesture which himselfe array'd, (Much fear'd for valour, more for vertue lov'd) With his owne hand on Darius corps he layd, Then wailing long as for a brother lost To have his funerals furnish'd like a Kings, He bids you use his wealth, and spare no cost; For, you shall want no necessary things. He hath his body hither sent by me, And funerall rites solemnely bent to do, He thinks that they may best accomplish'd be, Whil'st who him bred doth see him buried too. Cho. Behold how griefe hath her of sense bereft, Whil'st breath for passage strugling is with grones, No will, nor pow'r to live, just griefe hath left, Since what she valued vanish'd is at once. Sis. Ah! shall I see (no, let me first be blinde) That body breathlesse, which I brought to light? Where would my soule a force sufficient finde That could encounter with so sad a sight? O flinty heart! what hinders thee to breake, Since (crush'd with cares) a stranger to repose? Why part'st thou not (poore soule) that whil'st I speake In opening of my lips, mine eyes may close? This heritage of death, this wither'd stocke Is but a place appointed for despaires, A torture to it selfe, a stumbling block, Whose aged furrows fertile are in cares. Once for good Fortunes, now for bad design'd, (To state betray'd) drawne forth from calme repose, To have beene happie most afflicts my minde, Who, rais'd to fall, got much, the more to lose. Ah me! malitious fates have done me wrong, Who first come to the world, should first depart, And ah! why should the old o're-live the yong? This Nature wrongs by a prepost'rous art; Ah! why should Death so indiscreet be found To spare a caitive, and to spoyle a Prince? My halfe-dead body, bending to the ground, Through griefe is grown ripe for the grave long since. Chorus. VVhat makes vaine worldlings so to swell with pride, Who come of th'earth, and soone to th'earth returne? âSo hellish furies with their fire-brands burne âProud and ambitious men, that they divide âThem from themselves, and so turmoyle their mindes; âThat all their time they study still âHow to content a boundlesse will, âWhich never yet a full contentment findes; âWho so this flame within his bosome smothers, âHe many fancies doth contrive, âAnd even forgets himselfe alive, âTo be remembred after death by others; âThus while he is, his paines are never ended, âThat whil'st he is not, he may be commended. What can this help the happinesse of Kings So to subdue their Neighbours as they do? And make strange Nations tributaries too? âThe greater state, the greater trouble brings; Their pompes and triumphs stand them in no stead; Their Arches, Tombes, Pyramides high, And statues are but vanity: They dye, and yet would live in what is dead; And while they live, we see their glorious actions Oft wrested to the worst, and all their life Is but a stage of endlesse toyle, and strife, Of tumults, uproares, mutinies, and factions; âThey rise with feare, and lye with danger downe, âHuge are the cares which wait upon a Crowne. And as Ambition Princes under-mynes; So doth it those who under them rule all: We see in how short time they rise and fall, How oft their light ecclips'd but dimmely shines; They long time labour by all meanes to move Their Prince to value much their parts, And when advanc'd by subtle arts, O what a danger is't to be above! For, straight expos'd to hatred, and despight, With all their skill they cannot march so even; But some opprobrious scandall will be given: For all men envy them who have most might; âAnd if the King dislike them once, then straight âThe wretched Courtiers fall with their owne weight. Some of a sprite more poore, who would be prais'd, And yet have nought for which to be esteem'd, What they are not in deed would faine be deem'd, And indirectly labour to be rais'd. This crue each publicke place of honour haunts, And (changing garments every day) Whil'st they would hide, do but bewray With outward ornaments their inward wants; And men of better judgement justly loath Those, who in outward shows place all their care, And decke their bodies, whil'st their mindes are bare, Like to a shadow, or a painted cloth, The multitude which but th'apparrell notes, Doth homage, not to them, but to their cotes. Yet Princes must be serv'd, and with all sorts: Some both to do, and counsell what is best, Some serve for Cyphers to set out the rest, Like life-lesse pictures which adorne the ports; âFaire Palaces replenish'd are with feares, âThose seeming pleasures are but snares, âThe royall robe doth cover cares; âTh' Assyrian dye deare buys he who it beares; âThose dainty delicates, and farre-fetch'd food, âOft (through suspition) savour out of season, âEmbrodred beds, and tapestries hatch treason; âThe golden Goblets mingled are with bloud. âSuch shows the shadows are when Greatnesse shines, âWhose state by them the gazing world divines. O happie he who farre from Fame at home, Securely sitting by a quiet fire, (Though having little) doth not more desire, But first himselfe, then all things doth o'recome; His purchase weigh'd, or what his parents left, He squares his charges to his store, And takes not what he must restore, Nor eates the spoyles that from the poore were reft: Not proud, nor base, he (scorning creeping Art) From jealous thoughts and envy free, No poyson feares in cups of tree; No treason harbours in so poore a part: No heavy dreame doth vex him when he sleeps, âA guiltlesse minde the guardlesse cottage keeps. He doth not studie much what stormes may blow, Whose poverty can hardly be impair'd; He feares no forraine force, nor craves no guard; None doth desire his spoyle, none looks so low, Whereas the great are commonly once crost, As Darius hath beene in his flowre, Or Sisigambis at this houre, Who hath scap'd long, and now at length is lost: But how comes this, that Potentates oft fall, And must confesse this trouble of their soule? There is some higher pow'r that can controull, The Monarchs of the Earth, and censure all: Who once will call their actions to account, And them represse who to oppresse were prompt. FINIS.</field>
