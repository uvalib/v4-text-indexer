      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Garden, low Garden Wall, and a House. Enter a Courier. Cour. Hoa, there! You in the garden there! Hans [without]. Anan! [Enters. Good day, Sir. A fine morning. Did you call? O Esther! Esther! Cour. Who lives here? Hans. My master. Cour. That know I, well as you do! Do you think I took you for the owner of the house? Hans. I never said you did. O Esther! Cour. Who Lives here? Hans. My master, as I said before. Cour. You sluggish-witted knave! I want to know Your master's name. Hans. Couldn't you tell me so At once? What need of going round about, The gate before your nose? Why give you talk, And call you names, when all the fault's your own? How could I guess it was my master's name You wish'd to knowâO Esther! Cour. Who lives here? Hans. The minister of Mariendorpt. Cour. Is that Thy master's name? Hans. Why, 'tis all one. His name Is Muhldenau, and he's the minister Of Mariendorpt. Cour. Is that the only door To the house? Hans. Go round, you'll find another doorâ The proper oneâO Esther! Cour. This way? Hans. Yes. Cour. I'd like to have the quick'ning of thy wits! Esther [without]. What does that coxcomb speaking there so high? Hans. There's Esther coming! You had best be off! Cour. Hang you and her together! [Goes out. Hans. That is kind. I would not mind to hang along with her! I'm sick for love! I'm sure I am! I have lost My appetite! My stomach was my clock That used to give me note of eating-timeâ It never warns me now! A smoking dish Was sure to set my heart a-beating once; Now be it flesh, or fish, or fowl, or aught, It moves me nothing. I would rather feastâ A thousand times I wouldâon Esther's face! I'm mortal sick for love! I used to sleep; Scarce touch'd my head my pillow, I was off, And, let me lie, I took my measure on't Six hours, at least, upon a stretch! but now I toss and turn, lie straight, or doubled up, Enfold mine arms, or throw them wide abroad, Rhyme o'er my prayers, or count a hundred out, And then begin againâyet not a wink The richer for't, but rise as I lie down! And 'tis true love that ails me!âvery love! Of womankind but one can work my cure! 'Tis not as one may fancy veal, and, yet, Put up with mutton! If I get not her, I starve and die! How I do love thee, Esther! But thou regard'st it not, nor pay'st it heed; Thou ratest me as nothing; but I'm something, Or never had I fall'n in love with thee. Nor durst I tell thee how I love thee, Esther! O! my fair Esther! O! my goddess, Esther!â My lily, pink, rose, tulip, everything That's beautiful and sweet!âwould thou wast by To hear the love-names I am calling thee! Esther enters, speaking angrily, holding some roots. Esther. Hoa, sirrah Hans? Is this your work? Hans. Dear Esther! Esther, I can bear anything, except Your anger! labour without wages!âwork From morn till nightâgo without breakfast, dinner, Or supperâsuffer aught, yet be a man! But when you rate me I am good for nothing!â A joint that's pick'd to the boneâfish, three days staleâ Wine gone a month without the stopperâcheese Scoop'd to the rind and kept in a hot pantry, Or foot of capon only with the strings Raked from the garbage where't has lain a week! Don't scold me, thenâin sooth you should not do't, For never say I unkind word to thee, But call thee, still, all sorts of loving names. Esther. You've spoil'd my garden! hoe'd my tulips up Instead of weedsâyou have!â Hans. Don't stamp at me, It makes my heart jumpâAh!â'Twas kind of you To stop! But knew she how I loved her foot, She would not stamp it at me. Esther. Why do you touch My garden? Hans. 'Tis to make it orderly; Keep the earth smooth, and rake it small as crumbs; Prop the tall flowers with standards; clear the beds Of chick-weed, grass, and thievish dandelion, That sucks up all the nourishment around it; Trim the box edges straight, and of a piece; And roll the gravel-walks till they are even And smooth as any carpet. Esther. Would your pains Would spare themselves! The other day you broke My finest rose. Hans. It was with kissing it! It was indeed your finest rose, and so I call'd it Esther; and, in very truth, Made love to it, and in my rapture broke it! O Esther, if you knewâ Esther. Knew what? Hans. Nay, nothing. You take me up so snappishly! I am sure I bear you much good willâI say good will Because I am afraid to tell you what I bear you; and when you intreat me harshly, I can't endure it, but it brings my heart Into my throat, that I begin to choke, And then I fall a-crying. Don't you see I'm crying nowâand wiping of my eyes? Esther. A fly has got into them. Hans. Do you say A fly? I would it were so small a thing! I would it were a gnat, a wasp, a hornetâ Better be stung by anything, than Esther. A fly indeed! I would it were a flyâ It was no fly! O Esther, if you knew! Esther. Knew what? What dost thou mean? Hans. Alack-aday! Esther. Go clean the knives and forks! [Stamping at him. Hans. They are made of steel, And steel is hard, and, if it is, no wonder. 'Tis steelâand 'tis its nature! 'Tis not so With human hearts, for they are flesh and blood, Whereof was never made, nor will be made, Nor can be made, a knife and fork; and yet No steel at times is harder! 'Tis a pity. Esther. Is all that silver clean'd? Hans. How sweet a sound Has silver! Yet 'tis heat-proof. Without fear You dip it in a pot of boiling broth, Which can not you the tongue, and yet how harsh The tongue will sometimes sound! Esther. [Stamping.] Have you your wits? Hans. Yes!âNo!âI only have a part of them. I'll tell you where the other part is gone, If you will let me. Esther. Well, sir! Hans. If you knewâ Esther. [Stamping more violently.] Begone, I'll never know!â [Hans goes out.] âWhat does he mean? The creature's not in love with me? Ne'er yet Met I the man was bold enough to woo me, And that among bold menâand would he try, Whom nature, by mistaking, framed a man, And gave a chicken's heart to? I should like To see him woo me! Why, I have ta'en his part, As might a mother, her girl-petted boy's, A thousand timesâsaved him from kicks and beatingsâ Fought for him, standing by and crowing, while He saw me win his battleââIf I knew!â I half suspect the thing's in love with me! And, now I think on't, for this month or two The boy is alter'd wondrously! He sighs, And sighs!âand mumbles to himself, and goes Moping about the house. Sure as I live, The boy's in love, and I'm to have a husband! I, to whom man durst never say soft thing The second time! A husband! I shall die At the thought. [Laughs.] Make Hans my husband [Laughs]âthen the end O' th' world were come. [Laughs.] O dear! my sides will crack With laughter! Esther go to church with Hans! Take oath to love, to honour, and obey him! [Laughs.] Yes, with a curtsey! and then take him home In my apron! Esther become wife to Hans! [Laughs.] Hans husband unto Esther! [Laughs.] Husband! [Laughs.] Husband! [Laughs.] Enter Madame Roselheim. Mad. Ros. Why, Esther, what's the matter? Esther. [Still laughing.] I'm laughing! Mad. Ros. I see you are. What makes you laugh? Esther. [Laughing.] A thought That came into my head. Mad. Ros. Dismiss it thenâ Behoves you to be busy with grave matters. Your master leaves us. He is summon'd hence By sudden requisition of high duty. Esther. How soon? Mad. Ros. At once. Prepare for his departure. Esther. Goes Meeta with him? Mad. Ros. No, nor any one. A secret mission takes him, for the service Of her, the royal dame, who was his mistress. Esther. And how will Meeta bear it? Mad. Ros. As she ought. Meeta knows nothing paramount to duty. Esther. And this to fall upon the very eve Of her wedding. Will it stop it? Mad. Ros. I don't know. Esther. I hope it will not; I have fear of crosses In all such matters. Mad. Ros. Thinkest thou of weddings? Esther. Madam! [Stifling a laugh. Mad. Ros. Why, Esther, what's the matter with you? Esther. Nothing!âThat isâUnless I laugh I die! [Goes out, laughing immoderately. Mad. Ros. What's come to her? 'Tis not her mood to laughâ At such a time, too! But I have not thought To waste on her. A dangerous mission thisâ A search, unauthorized, and that, with foes On every side of him. The reverend man For duty puts his life in jeopardy, Nor pauses, but as soon as call'd obeysâ His daughter on the eve of marriage too, As Esther saidâher bridegroom daily look'd for, My son, my Rupertâfit to mate a princess, But yet more fitly with sweet Meeta match'd, In virtue without peer! Will he postpone Their nuptials? No, he will not, if I know him. But whatsoever he resolves is wise; For piety is still the good man's law. [Goes out. SCENE II. âA Room in Muhldenau's House. Enter Muhldenau. Muhl. Meeta! I thought she was alone with me! No wonder if the news transfixes her With deep abstraction, newly told; when I, Already in possession on't, alike Forget myself! Why, Meeta! Come, my child. Meeta. [Entering.] And must you go? Muhl. The voice that calls me hence I never disobey'dâdurst disobey! Thou art here in safety. This, thy father's will, From want assures theeâleaves thee heir, indeed, To modest competence. Thy nuptials too, Which, for this chance I would not have postponed, Give thee a father in a husband. Thus, Absolved from care on thy account, I go. For thou art good, my child, and hast beside A Father whom thou lovest to obey, With power no less than will to guard his child, That trusts in himâin every place at hand, At every hourâthe Father of thy father! In whose strong hands, and pitiful as strong, I leave thee, saying, âLet his will be done!â Meeta. Will you be long away? Muhl. Not long, I hope; Not very long. What call you long, my child? A year? Meeta. O, not a year! Muhl. No!âNo! No fear Of that.âNo; certainly I shall not be A year away. Meeta. Nor half a year? Muhl. Nor half A year. Meeta. Half that? Muhl. I know not, but should think A lapse, more brief, should bring me home, again. Meeta. Perhaps a month? Muhl. Perhaps; but graver things Lie in the hands of seconds. Yea; a second Might balk departure, yet remove me from thee, Never again to meet theeâin this worldâ In this world, Meeta!âso, think less of absence, That, here, hath termination. Meeta. Is the mission That takes you, dangerous? Muhl. I'll not deceive you. It is. Meeta. Sweet Heaven have mercy! Muhl. It is well To call for thatâbut better 'tis to know That what Heaven wills is right!âBelieve in that, Thou'lt find it, in the end, to thy account. But what is danger? Is't always the thing We call so? Sin is danger, certainly; Putting in jeopardy man's proper lifeâ The life to come!âbut what is danger else? 'Tis hard to say! Of this, howe'er, be sure, More oft it wears a smooth face, than a rough; So, for the most part, found, when least expected, And fatalest! The storms that are foretold Are easiest metâthe reefs, avoided, That raise the ripple! He was feasting, Meeta, Who saw the writing, to the prophet's mind Explain'd alone, though manifest to all; And while the impious revel yet held on, The flood was turn'd aside, to let the surge Of battle in; and ruin overthrew Him and his kingdom! Hear me, Meeta; glad This summons makes me, though it threatens danger; And, for I know that it will hearten thee To bear my absence, I will tell thee why. Sit down, my child. Thou hadst a sister, Meeta. Meeta. A sister! Muhl. I have kept the knowledge from thee, To save the questioning had follow'd it, And could not be replied to, without cost Of suffering, while recollection of Bereavement yet was young. Meeta. I had a sister? Muhl. You had a sister. Meeta. Had? Muhl. Had, Meeta. Meeta. Had! Alas! was I so rich, and knew it not? I had a sister! O what light and warmth Of love, I never knew before, the thought Hath shot into my soul!âAnd nowâAnd now, All's strangely dark and cold! How is it, father, I had a sister, and remember not? Muhl. Because 'twas in thy childhood, Meeta, when The memory, too tender, yields impressions Their causes ta'en away.âAnd yet there was A time, when thou remember'dst such a thing! Meeta. Was there? O heartless Meeta! Once remember She had a sister, and forget it ever! Muhl. Thou hast forgot the siege of Magdeburgh. Meeta. No! I remember that! I never hear The thunder, but I think of that!âor see The lightning set the sky on fire, but that Comes back to me!âNo!âno!âI recollect The siege of Magdeburgh! Muhl. How long did it last? Meeta. One night. Muhl. Three months! Meeta. I only recollect One nightâand it was in the street, and men With horrid looks and yells ran to and fro! On horseback some, and some on footâsome firing, And some with weapons which they whirl'd and darted As they moved on! Muhl. Ay! Mercy show'd they not, That night, to man or woman! Meeta. Woman? No! I saw them seize one by the hair!âI am sure I did! Muhl. You didâyou told me so yourself. Meeta. I told you so myself? Muhl. You have forgot! And can you wonder? You were barely then Turn'd five years old. Were you not near that woman? Meeta. Yes! close to her! I had a hold of her. Muhl. That too you told me. Do you not remember? Meeta. No. Muhl. No!âNot when I found thee in the street Wandering alone, and, 'twixt thy sobbings, on Thy father calling? Meeta. No. Muhl. Thou told'st it me The following day, and often afterwards. I let the fruitless inquisition drop. So memory fell asleep! Remember'st aught That woman carried? Meeta. Carried? Muhl. Carried. Meeta. No. Muhl. She was thy sister's nurseâ Meeta. It was a child She carried! Was it? YesâI see it now In her arms, as plain as I see you. O heart! What hast thou been about? All's clear as noon!â A child she carried, and it was my sister! I recollect my sister! Were they kill'd? Muhl. The woman was. Meeta. And not my sister? Muhl. That Knows Heaven alone! That night of carnage over, We search'd the streetâthe woman's body found, But, of thy little sister, not a trace! Meeta. And yet you search'd the street?âShe was not kill'd! Had she been kill'd, her body had been found Sure as the nurse'sâYes!âand I have heard Nine times in ten, when caught in mortal strait, A woman with an infant in her arms, Although she lose herself, will save her load! She was not kill'd, for didn't I escape? I, quite alone, and clamouring as you say!â They hurt not me whom else soe'er they hurt; And would they harm a little speechless child, As like to smile at them as look afraid; To come to them, if it could walk, as flee? 'Tis not in mortal man that has his wits, To slay a little harmless, witless child! To wound it, scratch it!âI would stake my life She was not kill'dâSome good man snatch'd her upâ Took her awayâput in a place of safetyâ Heaven bless him!âcherishes her now perhaps As if she were his own! Do you not think She is alive?âI'm sure she is alive; I have a sister still! Muhl. Thy sanguine heart A little light enlarges into day. It is thy father's nature which thou hast, Uncheck'd in thee, in him subdued by time. Now see'st thou why this summons is a thing To welcome? Hitherto my debt to thee, My yearnings for my lost one still has held In checkâyes, yearnings, Meeta; for I own The likeness, though a faint one, of thy hope, Touching thy sister, round thy father's heart Hath ever hung! but now that I am call'dâ Commandedâfor 'tis even so, my childâ To leave theeâthough the track I must pursue Borders with danger, yet it is a journey I undertake more pleased, than grudgingly; Forâif we may believe in presagesâ And wherefore not, if we believe at allâ As who shall shape and bound the ways of Heavenâ To other issue than its proper one, And nearer to myself, this mission leadsâ Perhaps concerning thee!âperhapsâYes, Meeta, I cannot help the thought, for, next to thee, It is the stay of my old ageâperhaps Concerningâ Meeta. My lost sister. Muhl. Yes, my child, Not dead, but lost as thou believ'st. How well You reason'd on't! The body was not found: A nurse, as now thou saidst, will lose herself, Yet save her loadâ'tis not, I do believe, In flesh and blood to slay a little child! You're right, the child was savedâis living yet! You have made your father turn a boy again! Well, be it so! I do believe it, Meeta! You are content, my child, to let me go? Meeta. I am, sirâthat is, not, as at the first, My heart grows sick at thought of losing you. Couldn't I go too?âNo!âNo!âThere is danger, And that's my answer. Farewell, father!âThere! We'll say good-bye at once! Muhl. Not yet, my child! Shouldst thou require a friend, while I'm away, Here is the name of one. He lives in Prague: He is a Jew. Meeta. A Jew? Muhl. He'll give thee counsel, Shouldst thou have need of it. Meeta. A Jew? Muhl. Or, if Thy funds run low, in sudden exigence, He'll help them mount again. Meeta. A Jew? Muhl. Why not? Meeta. And I a Christian father's child! Muhl. Is not A Jew a man? Wouldst thou, a Christian, help A Jew, that's of thy creed an enemy? Meeta. I would! Muhl. And why not then a Jew help thee? I know a reason; but the blame on't lies Not on the other side. It is the race Elect from all mankind, whose course is mark'd From far-off time by high behests from Heaven, By miracles and oracles, and deeds Of mighty men who put their trust therein! Don't fear thy father's friend!âDon't fear the Jew! Meeta. I am corrected, sir.âI shall observe. Muhl. Here comes thy Rupert's motherâand in time. Enter Madame Roselheim. My absence, madam, need not be a let To stay my daughter's nuptials with thy son. I know a soldier's time is not his own; And what is granted him, behoves him use. So, Meeta, do not wait for my return, If past the time, delay'dâFarewell, my child! Madam, farewell!âWe are in the hands of Heaven! [Goes out; and Meeta, after a struggle, falls weeping upon the neck of Madame Roselheim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âMuhldenau's Garden. Wreaths of flowers hung from the branches of the treesârustic seats here and there, ornamented. Enter Esther and Hans. Hans. Now, Esther, have I pleased you? Is there aught I have forgotten? Are the garlands right? The seats in order, and the company, Bid as you told me? There's the music too, Three fiddlesâfirst and second, and a bass, A hautboy, flute, and harp! Are you not pleased? Look pleased! Do, Esther! Seldom do you smile On me; and welcomer than Christmas day, Or New-Year's day, or any day o' the year, Were one kind look from Esther. Esther. To say truth, You have managed finely! Hans. La! how sweet you smile! What's honey now? I wouldn't take a hive To pay for't with that smile. Indeed, I wouldn't, In very deed, I wouldn'tâand I'm fond Of honey! furious fond of it. O dear! A thing so sweet to see, what must it be To taste? O happy days of boyhood, when Whatever I did right was sure to get me A kiss from my mother. Times are changed with Hans; Do what he may, he gets no kisses now. Esther. The boy wants me to kiss him!âSo!âGood Hans, 'Tis not with men, you know, as 'tis with boys: Kisses may come to boys, but men must fetch them. Hans. But knew I, I could get themâI would fetch them! Esther. Why, Hans, how can you know unless you try? Hans. Unless I try!âNow mean you what you say? Esther. Why say it else? Hans. And they'll be had by fetching? Esther. A fool may tell they'll not be had without. Hans. O Esther! Esther. Well! Hans. Would I could hear thee say, âO Hans!â Esther. O Hans! There, I've said it!âWell? Hans. Durst I but try? But then there is the fear! Esther. And there's the hope! the flower beside the weed. Hans. O Esther!âOh. Esther. O Hans! Hans. Give me a kiss! Esther. Fool!âsaid I not before, Men must fetch kisses, though to boys they come? Hans. O would you fancy me a boy! Esther. I do; Not only fancy thee, but know thee one! Hans. Then treat me as a boy. Esther. How? Hans. As you said Just now that boys were treated Esther. As I live, He'd have it come from me! What said I now? Hans. You said that kisses come to boys. Esther. I did; And so do railings, cuffs, and fifty things That are not half so sweet!âDid I not say The dance was to be practised? Where are, then, The partners? Where's the music? In a minute The bridegroom comes, when all should be prepared, Is that the time for making ready? Stand'st With gaping mouth when busy hands are neededâ Fetch here the dancers and the music. Hans. [Without moving.] Yes. Esther. Is that the way to do it? Will they come With only saying âYes?â Art thou a post? Hans. In sooth I know not what I am! I know I'm not myself! I may be man or woman, A fish or a brute beast, a stone, or log Of wood, for what I care! I would 'twere now All over with me, and the undertaker Were working for me! It will come to that! I'll do thy biddingâthen I'll go and dieâ I will! I'll tie a true true-lover's knot, You'll see I willâGood-bye!â Esther. [Stamping.] Hans! Hans. Well? Esther. Have here The dancers, ere I stamp my foot again. Hans. I fly. [Goes out. Esther. Poor Hans! The boy is deep in love! How have I managed to light up this flame? âHeigho-ho!â âO dear!â The simpleton, I vow, Grows interesting! I should grieve for Hans, Were aught to happen to him. It is hard To be the bane of a poor fellow's peace, Much more to be the death of him! Should he go And drown himself! or hang himself, indeed! Hans! [Calling] I could never bear myself again! To see him laid out in his shroud! Hans! Hans! [Calling] To follow the poor fellow to his graveâ To see him lower'd into't.âWhy, Hans! [Calling] I hear The earth upon him is coffin! Hans, I say! Where are you? Hans. [Entering with dancers.] Here! Is anything the matter, You call'd me in a tone of such distress? Esther. [Recovering herself.] Am I not in a hurry, and you take An hour and more to do a minute's work! Hans. I'm sure I'm hardly gone a minute. Esther. Fool! You cannot tell a minute from an hour! Hans. Here are the dancers and the music, but One partner is a-wanting. Esther. You stand up! Hans. It is a woman's wanting. Esther. 'Tis no matter, Take you her place. Hans. I'll do whate'er you bid me, But 'tis too bad to make a woman of me. Esther. [impatiently]. Are you ready? Hans. Yes! I'll dance him till I tire him. [Dance. Hans exerts himself to the utmost, constantly looking towards Esther, who gradually becomes pleased, and still more and more enjoys his vivacity. His partner gives up, and Hans dances by himself before Esther, who humours his steps. The others at length dance off. Hans. Danced I to please you? Esther. Yes: and there your thanks. [Kisses him. Hans. And there are yours for paying me so well! [Kissing again. Mars! if I haven't kiss'd her! Esther. Hans! Why, Hans! Hans. Nay, don't be angry! All the blame was yours; You kiss'd me first. 'Twas only kiss for kiss! Esther. Here's some one coming! Why you idle boy! Nothing within, without the house, to do, That you keep standing here? No plate to clean? No knives and forks? no furniture to polish? No glasses nor decanters to be rinsed, And dried and clear'd? When put you last to rights Your pantry? 'Twas in wondrous order when I look'd into it yesterday! Go, sir! A gaping mouth won't serve for busy hands! To work, I say! Do you hear me, boy? Hans. I do, Yet hardly can believe it. Esther. Hence. To work! [Hans goes out, Mad. Ros. [Entering.] To work? Why, Esther 'tis a holiday! Knew you what you were saying? Do you hear me? Esther turn'd girl! May I believe my eyesâ And they have never fail'd me yetâI saw thee Kiss the lad Hans just now? Esther. 'Twas he kiss'd me. Mad. Ros. You first kiss'd him. Esther. Well, if I did, I did. He danced just now, and pleased me, 'twas so wellâ And so I kiss'd him, as a woman may A boy! Mad. Ros. You are right; you might have said a child: Hans is no more. Esther. Hans no more than a child? He's twenty-five!âHe says so, next birthday. A pretty child indeed! If he's a child, Children are marriageable! Such a child My mother's husband was, when birth of me Made him a father. Mad. Ros. Be not angry, Esther; I did not say of Hans he was too young To be a husbandâif you fancy him. Esther. I fancy Hans? I fancy living man, And Hans especially! I, that am gall At very thought a man should be my master! I, to whom never ventured man to say Soft thing a second timeâand those have tried Who have back'd furious seas, and shown a front To bayonet-points and loaded cannon-mouthsâ And I to fancy Hans! I thank you, ma'am. Dress up a girl in boy's clothes for me, do, And send her me for husband! Hans indeed To call me wife! I to call Hans my husband! How I should like to hear myself! I'll marry When it rains husbands!âbut it shan't be Hans! Mad. Ros. Well, Esther, do not fret. Esther. I fret? I think I see myself! Fret about Hans! I know You only jested. 'Twas a rare conceit To say I'd marry Hans. [Laughs.] I'll kill myself With laughing at the thought. Esther to marryâ And Hans, of all mankind! Mad. Ros. You are right. 'Twas jest! I have always set you down for an old maid. Go see if Meeta's ready. Esther. [Aside.] An old maid! Thank Heaven, I'm only five-and-thirty yet. Old maid indeed, and only thirty-five! I yet may live to be a grandmother! [Goes out. Mad. Ros. No sign of Rupert yet, and noon is past. He will not come. These nuptials will be stopp'd. Her father's summons boded, as I thought, No good. There is in the affairs of life, As in the atmosphere, a season, where To shining day succeedeth shining day; But once the weather breaks, 'tis cloud and cloud, And long-deferr'd and slow, the clearing up! Enter Messenger with letters, and retires. From Rupert! I was rightâhe will not come: The field is ta'en a month before the time. His leave has been recall'd! Poor Meeta! Go Undress thee, girl! Thy gear of every day Belongs to this, on which thou thought'st to wear The brightest suit that virginhood puts on! This is to Meetaâfrom her father? Noâ The hand is strange! Why, who should write to her Except her father? About whom but him, Or Rupert should she hear, and he has told His errand in my letter! If it speaks About her father, harm has fall'n upon him! And how will Meeta bear it? Firm of mindâ Yet with a heart, so quickly tender, how Support the news of evil fall'n on him! What can have chanced? Perhaps imprisonment! Not death? O no! not death! It cannot be! Heaven, for his child's sakeâfor his ownâwill spare him. [Goes out. SCENE II. âMeeta's Dressing-room. Meeta and Esther enterâthe former abstracted, the latter making a bridal knot. Esther. No favour for your breast! A bride, and go To church without a favour! Well! to think, Of all things, that should be forgot! Almost As well forget your wedding-day itself! Almost as well no wedding as no favour! Know'st thou not so? [Touching her. Meeta. What said you to me, Esther? Esther. There! I protest, as well it were the wall I spoke to as to you! as much 'twould hear me! What said you to me, Esther? Esther saidâ It was your wedding-dayâthat you forgot A favour for your breastâthat she would make oneâ And here 'tis ready! Let me pin it on. Meeta. No word yet from my father! Esther. From your father? Your lover, don't you mean? Meeta. I mean my father! Esther. Humph! Give me anything but want of nature! I do not like you, Meeta! Flesh and blood Are flesh and blood! Were it my wedding-day, Almost the very hour, and every minute The bridegroom look'd for, would my thought be running Upon my father? To be honest, Meeta, I'd think of something dearerâthat I would, And be a good child still! Meeta. You lost your father When you were but an infant. You don't know What 'tis to love a father. Esther. Do I not? Yes; but I do! It is to honour him, So we are biddenâthat is, to obey himâ Respectfully entreat him! Meeta. Nothing more? Esther. What more? Meeta. O, much!âO, very much!âSuch things We do to those that are indifferent to us, Compared to a father! There is something moreâ Betterâless earthlyâmore o' th' grain of Heavenâ A love that's indefinable!âthat holds Ourselves as nothing, in respect of cherishing! That's ever kneeling though no limb be bent, And looking up with ever-watching will, Anticipating wishes!âIt is worshipâ Although no lip be moved, no eye be strain'd, No hands be clasp'dânext that which hath acceptance AboveâO' the soul! O, how I love my father! To say âbefore my lifeâ is to say nothingâ That's his, and 'tis a gasp and over! but To slave, beg, starve for himâforego possession Of mine own dearest earthly wishesâhavingsâ I'd do it, Esther, in a moment!âYes! Not give't a second thought! Remember'st thou I once was froward with thee? I was then A girl not ten years oldâdost not remember? I had found a hair of hisâa long white hair, And I had coil'd it up to treasure it; But thou didst flout me for't and take't away, And cast into the fireâwhence all your might It took to hold me. Yes, I would have thrust My hand into the fire to save that hair! That is to love a father! Esther. If it is, Then know I not what 'tis to love a father! Meeta. You never knew one, said I not before? But mine was twice a parentâthat is, Esther, He was my father and my mother too. I never knew my mother, but I am sure I should have loved herâdearly loved her, Esther; But my fatherânurse was he to me, instructor, Playmate, companion, fatherâall, together! Think of that, Esther. Playmate! Such a man To bend into a child for my sake! There I half believe I find the root of love Which has struck deepest.âHe to play the child With his white hairs!âThere is not one of them But has a heart and soul in'tâto me, Esther!â Don't smileâYou know you own you cannot tell What 'tis to love a father. Enter Madame Roselheim. Mad. Ros. Meeta! Meeta. Well, Dear Madame Roselheim? Mad. Ros. The post is in. Meeta. And Rupert doesn't come?âI thought 'twould be so! I was prepared for it! I wish'd itâthough My father will'd our nuptials should go on. 'Tis well! O, if there be one hour, which more Than any other craves a parent's presence, 'Tis that which gives his child away from him! She should go with his blessing, warm upon her, breathed With an attesting kiss; then may she go With perfect hope, and cheerly take with her The benisons of all kind wishers else!â You know I love your son? Mad. Ros. [Weeps.] I know it, well, My Meeta. Meeta. Madam!âMother! I'm the brideâ You must not weep till I do!â'Tis not fair, I'll not be beat in disappointment, I That have chief cause to feel it! Is he ill? Mad. Ros. No!âNo! Meeta. Thank Heaven! and yet some other cause As grave as that of health, perhaps, prevents him? Mad. Ros. No; the campaign has open'dânothing more. Meeta. Enough!âLong marchesânightly guardsâchill sleeping In the open fieldsâforagingsâreconnoiteringsâ Skirmishingsâstormings and pitch'd battles! Rupert, Poor Rupert! [Weeps.]âMother, I am quits with you, There are my tears 'gainst yours! Mad. Ros. I wasn't weeping For Rupert, Meeta. Meeta. For whom, then?âMy father? Mad. Ros. For no oneâthat is, there's no cause I know of Why I should weep. Meeta. Why weep then? Mad. Ros. 'Twas a fear I hadâ Meeta. About my father?âIs that letter For me? The one unopen'd?âGive it me! don't fear. Though I'm a girl, I have a resolution. [Reads letter. Read it! [Handing it to Madame Roselheim. Mad. Ros. Arrested! and a prisoner In Prague!âHis fate uncertainâbut his life In peril, Meeta! [Tottering as on the point of fainting. Meeta. [Trying to recover her.] Mother!âMadam!âMadam!â Mother!âMadame Roselheim, don't give way!âthese things Are catching, and I want to be myself! I must be myselfâI will be myself!âI'll not waver, Flinch, droop, the matter of a moment.âMadam! I have need of all the nerve I haveâand help me! Don't take it from me!âMy father wants it all, And he must have it, and shall!âWell, well! give way! The more you are water, the more will I be rock! I am so!âLet me seeâ Mad. Ros. My child!âmy Meeta! Thou show'st it not; but, if I feel the shock, What must it prove to thee! Meeta. Nothing, madam!ânothing! Let's seeâHow many miles is Prague from this? I recollectâthat's right!âthat's right!âI have My senses all about meâI thank Heaven! The paper that he gave me?âIt is hereâ In my bosom!âI remember everything! I am quite myself! Mad. Ros. Meeta! this calmness frights me! Meeta. Don't mind it!âAll is well!âI recollect, To every syllable, all my father told me! And I will do his bidding.âA fine time 'Twould be for me to swoon! [Laughs]âa proper time! [Laughs. I must not laugh; for if I do, I'm lost! Heaven give me firmness!âOf myself, I'm nothing! There!â'tis gone off. I'll but provide myself, And away! [Going towards her chamber. Mad. Ros. Where go you, Meeta? Meeta. To my chamber, madam! Mad. Ros. What go you there to do? Meeta. To change my dress. Mad. Ros. But, Meeta!â Meeta. Mother, let me have my way!â Don't hinder me, and do not follow me! Else, that may come you would not wish to happen! Command me, after, all my life, so now You suffer me be mistress of myself! [Goes out. Mad. Ros. She makes me trembleâshe's so little moved! Why, Esther! are you too about to swoon? Esther. Almost I am!âMy heart turn'd sick just now; But it grows better. Mad. Ros. What do you think of Meeta? Esther. I wonder at herâbut she's all a wonder! Had you but heard her talk, ere you came in, About her father!â Mad. Ros. I'm afraid of her. She is too calmâit is unnatural!â She cannot be herself, thus to sustain What taxes you and me, too much, to whom It comes not half so home!âShe has not shed A tear!âNo sound of sufferingâa moan, A sighâa breath, you could mistake for oneâ Has 'scaped her! She forbade me follow her; But am I right to heed her? Reason is gone, Ere you suspect that it has given way; So this collectedness may be but crust, Not substance; which, while you believe't to be, Straight crumbles into dust! We should not leave her Alone. Esther. I heed her not!âI'll follow her! [Going. Meeta. [Entering.] Where are you going, Esther? Esther. Into your chamber, To look for you. Meeta. Well!âhere I am!âWhat want you? Esther. Why, you are dress'd as 'twere to go a journey! Meeta. I am. Mad. Ros. And whither go you, Meeta? Meeta. To My father! Mad. Ros. Are you mad? Meeta. I could be mad! But I must keep my reasonâand I will! Mad. Ros. Reflect you on the distance? Meeta. 'Tis a stride! Mad. Ros. A stride! And do you calculate The danger? Meeta. There's no dangerânone, but that In which he lies! Mad. Ros. You may be stopp'd by robbers! Meeta. There are no robbers. Mad. Ros. Recollect the war! Meeta. There is no war. Mad. Ros. Know'st thou what thou art saying? Meeta. I do,âBelieve it! 'Tis the shortest way. Thou'lt have to take't at last! Esther. She shall not stir. Meeta. Nay, but I will!âand go! Mad. Ros. Don't let her, Esther; Lay hold upon her. Esther. Will I not! Meeta. You will not!â You must not!âdare not! If you do, his blood Lie at your door! Mad. Ros. Alas! what power have you To help him, child? Meeta. My will!âWhere there's the will, You cannot tell but there may be the power! Strong will can make a little power go farâ At least, can I not beg his enemies To spare his life? Mad. Ros. You'll find their hearts are stone. Meeta. Perhaps; but I shall try to prove them flesh. Mad. Ros. And if thou prove they are not? Meeta. Then, I'll deal With his prison bolts and bars. Mother, 'tis vain! Prevent me now, and I will 'scape again; If not to-day, to-morrow. If not then, The next dayâor the following. So time That's preciousâeverythingâis lost, and, then, The mischief done, and no good come of it That might have come, were time used promptly! Madamâ Mother,â'tis reason, plain to speculation, As the hand I lift before you now to Heaven To register my vow, that no regard Of difficulty, or unlikelihood, Or danger, or persuasion, or enforcement, Shall hold me back one moment from the attempt To save my father's life. Heaven bless you, madam! Esther, good-bye! That's rightâNo weepingâNothing But a kiss, and part!âGood-bye!âGood-bye!âGood-bye</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Room in Joseph's House at Prague. Enter Joseph and Ahab. Ahab. More gold! Jos. Yes, Ahab, more! The dross is mine, Thou only hast the custody, and yet Thou yield'st it me, as it were drops of blood From thine own heart! I say I want more gold, And more to follow, yet, if that suffice not; And failing gold, I'll coin my parchments, plate, Jewels, and furnitureâmy very roofâ But I shall find supplies! Ahab. And for a Christian? Jos. Thou art my brother-Jew. What couldst thou more Than risk thy life for mine? Ahab. I do not know What greater venture man can risk for man, Than his own life. Jos. Wouldst thou risk thine for me? Thou art honest, Ahab, though thou lov'st thyself Better than any living thing beside. Thou pausest to consider! Do not pause, 'Tis waste of time, which I will save thee. Ahab, Thou wouldst not risk thy life for me. Now mark,â When I suffer'd persecution, Ahab, Ten years ago, in Spain,âwhere Christian men In their Master's name, did that which never yet Their Master's precepts warrantedâI say it, For it is written, Ahab, written plain, That he who runs may readâwhen Christian men Gave human, living flesh to roast, because We held the old faith and eschew'd the new,â The Christian father of this Christian child Then saved my life at peril of his own!â Get the gold, Ahab! He did that for me, That was not of his creed, thou wouldst not do, Who holdest it! Ahab, I, then, believed The Master taught them right! He is my neighbour That does a neighbour's office unto me! The gold, and plenty on'tâa hundred ducats! Ahab. A hundred ducats? Jos. 'Tis the twentieth part Of what remains! A portion of his life He did not risk, but all. Resolve at once To do my bidding, else my mind may change, And I may bid thee fetch the whole,âthe whole! A prompt compliance, in a strait, is best. Where others have the power to make conditions! Resistance tires forbearance! Fetch the gold, For the sake of him who saved the hands that made it From the fire.âLook here! they are not cinders, Ahab, But flesh; and thank a Christian. Fetch the gold! [Ahab goes out. Poor girl! how she has wasted since she first Came here: yet how her spirit lasts, beyond Her body: there she suffers no impairment! My Rachel had been like her, had she lived,â The face reminds me of her, as it shines From the thick bower of her raven hair, When, now and then, by chance, I see it down! Enter Meeta. What news, my girl? Meeta. None!âI have sped to-day As yesterday! The names of âfather,âââchild,â Seem here to carry, to men's hearts, no import Past that of lightest words. They hardly win An audience for me! When they do, the eye Of the listener, every other moment caught By passing trivial'st things, admonishes My tongue it only wastes an earnest suit Upon a heedless ear. Once, as I thought, My auditor was moved,âalmost he seem'd To give me hope,âI felt as if about To cross the threshold of the prison, and Blessings and thanks rose in my throat so thick, That utterance quite fail'd me, and, except For tears, that sudden came to my relief, I had fallen at his feet,âyet at that very moment Some antic, feat I saw not, but a wretch Practised within his view, convulsed him straight With laughter, 'mid the peals of which he left me, As I had ne'er been standing there! A clap Of thunder had not stunn'd me half so much. Jos. Was't a new warden? Meeta. Yes. Jos. Corrupt his heart, With pity at the door to thrust it back, And let the mood, it shrinks from, enter in! Meeta. They are all alike! See. [Showing an empty purse. Jos. Thou hast emptied it? Well, I can fill it again! Meeta. All gone, and naught To show for it: a heart-full, too, of prayers! Jos. I fear there is no hope! Meeta. Don't say it! Though For so far we have found men's hearts but stones, Still will we turn them up. It cannot be But we shall light on one that's flesh and blood. I won't believe it! Yea, though from my hand The hundred thousandth one dropp'd dead as flint, I'd go to the next as though the human touch Might meet me there! No! while my father lives, I'll ne'er give up the hope to save his life! Jos. A girlâand proof against despondence thus! Meeta. I often fear you deem me hard of heart. Perhaps you think I do not weep enough? It is not that I could not weepâit is That I won't weepâthat I won't give wayâthat I'll keep My spirit upâmy thoughts about meâwaste Naught that my father wants! I can't afford To be a child and melt. No! I must be A deliverer, and, to dissolvement, proof As a rock. I have not shed a single tear But as a prayerâexcept to-day, when I gasp'd, And must have wept or dropp'd, and even then It came of itself! Thou saidst just now thou fear'dst There was no hope? But there is! I came resolved To keep it from thee, promise had so oft Enticed belief to balk it. I have a chance To see the daughter of the Governor. Jos. How came this blessed chance? Meeta. Ha! blessed, say'st thou?â Perhaps 'twill prove so!âThe poor human heart, How it doth build, and build on slightest grounds! Words dropp'd by chance 'twill take for prophecies! We'll pray it may be bless'dâWe, then, may hope for't! Well, I will tell you. Jos. Hope begins to dawn! Meeta. Didn't I say there was no fear of hope? I went, as every day I yet have done, To the Governor's. The man that oped the gate Was a new warder. A new face, new hope! I told my tale; and, when 'twas done, implored him Prefer my poor petition to his lady, To grant me briefest audience. Jos. To the daughter Of the Governor? Meeta. To her! Jos. I see: go on! Meeta. Like all the rest, he show'dânot plainly though, But by a hintâthat charities were things Of cost, and must be bought with more than thanks. My purse was officeless, my last balk'd suit Had of its trust absolved it quiteâa wretch Who bragg'd, to win my bribe, a power he had not, And added savage mockery to the wrong! I pleaded destitution. âWhat,â he cried, âNo toy, no trinket, you could turn to coin!â And rudely snatching from its place my hood, Which I had just unloosed, for want of airâ âHa!â he exclaim'd, âwhat costly treasure's this!â As, by the action from its band released, My hair fell all around me! Jos. Thereof make they High traffic. I have known a head of hair, Of ordinary goodliness, to bring A common peasant maid a little dower! There scarce were price a woman might not set On one so rich as thine. Meeta. Indeed! I would I then had known its valueâI had made A surer bargain. Jos. Durst he ask it of thee? Wretch! He shall never have it! Thou shalt take A purse of ducats to him. Meeta. It is his Already. With my leave he sever'd it, As only 'twere the string that held it up, And, glad, I gave it to him. Jos. I, at hand, To fill thy purse! A quarter of an hour Had ta'en thee here and back. Meeta. And in that time His mind had changed, or he had been removed, And in his place another put, and all Had been to do again, and that, perhaps With lessen'd chance.âHad he ask'd me for a limb, He had had itâhad it!ânot one precious moment Had I stay'd haggling with him. It had gone As the hair of my headâayâas a single hair. 'Tis time I goâ Enter Ahab. Ahab. Despatches have arrived. Meeta. They bring the order for my father's death. I see it! Say it. You cannot tell me worse Than I know. Ahab. The news is bad. Meeta. I'll not give up While there is chance the substance of a threadâ A film! Although a thousand emperors Had sworn to take the life of his grey hairs, While it is in them, I will try and save it! Jos. Thou lookest faint! Some wine will hearten thee. Meeta. I'll have no wine but such as I draw hence, From my heart! There's not such wine in all thy house To strengthen me! There's plenty, and to spare! What time is he to die? Jos. Tell her. No use Withhold it from her. Her spirit is the arch Which gaineth strength by that which burdens it. Ahab. He is to die within three days, although The Governor his case reported so, It might have gain'd for him a milder doom. Meeta. Did he? Did the Governor? Did you say The Governor his case reported kindly? The Governor? he?âhe that's here?âhere now In Prague?âthe very Governor of Prague? Ahab. The same; but some severe reverse, 'tis said, Our arms have met with, so have overcast The imperial mind, that clemency is quench'd, And thus thy father's death, alas, decreed! Meeta. I would be here, and twenty leagues from this. Jos. Why twenty leagues from this? Meeta. That distance lives A friend might give me help. Jos. Then suffer me To be thy second self, and see that friend. Meeta. He is an enemy to Prague. Jos. And Prague An enemy to theeâand I'm thy friend! Trust me, my child. Meeta. My father told me this, O thou good manâThou Christian!âPardon me. Jos. Pardon thee, child? I thank and honour thee: Thou canst not praise me more than call me that Thy heart esteemeth best. Meeta. Then come with me, And I'll instruct thee on the way. 'Tis time I see the servant of the Governor. Three days we have from thisâThat's three whole daysâ He dies on Saturdayâ[Ruminating]âHe shall not die! [They go out. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in the Governor's. Enter Baron Idenstein and Adolpha. Iden. Indeed, indeed, it was not wisely done! 'Tis wrong that pity should be sufferer By her sweet nature, as she is, enduring Its gentle throes in vainâwhich are relieved When of avail to those for whom they're borne; Else, pain incontinently! 'Twas not right To promise audience to her, her affliction Past help! What canst thou give her but thy tears? And what are they? They cannot ope for her Her father's prison-door, nor wash away The writing of the warrant which decrees His term of life. Thou shouldst have sent her word âIt could not beâââIt was of no avail.â 'Twas rending thy own heart, without repair Of hers! 'Twas idle waste of agony! 'Twas feeding hope thou knew'st was sure to die! Adol. Is there no hope? Iden. There! Were it fate herself Said âNo,â thy sanguine nature would not rest, But ask again with thought she'd change her mind. His doom is fix'dâwithin three days, he dies. Adol. On Saturday? Iden. Yes; Saturday's the day. Adol. Take me from Prague! I would not be in Prague That day! I see the reverend old man Dragging along the street, as on the day I saw him firstâby accident approaching The casement as he pass'd!âhis silver'd head Uncover'd, an unseemly sight, beset, As 'twas, by fierce array of threatening arms, In hands wherein the pith of life was fresh, Which better, far, it had become to give Protection to him than oppose offence. 'Twas only for a moment, but the form Of the old man has never left me since. I will not be in Prague the day he dies; I wish I could forget when that day comes!â What day is this!âWhen will be Saturday! O to have time, 'twixt this and after then, A blank, that I might pass that cruel day, Nor know on't till 'twas gone! Iden. My sweet Adolpha, A strange and wondrous compound is thy heart, Frame of all moods, from gravest to most light; And all in like extreme! Thy mirth defies All other wing!âThy sadness dives a depth Where none can follow thee! No eye such stores Of tears! No cheek such treasury of smiles! Most natures have their bias, thine hath none, Save goodness which directs and poises all! My love! thou shalt not be in Prague, that day. Adol. But must it come? Iden. See there again! Thy heart Will take no answer, save what pleases it; And, yet, is positive, as well as I, It cannot have. Adol. My father's Governor! Iden. The Emperor is his master. Adol. Let him be! Were I my father, in a case like this, I would gainsay the Emperor!ârefuse To do his bidding, or evade obedienceâ Do anything but take the old man's life! 'Tis murder, Idenstein! He was no spy!â Came on no hostile mission!ânothing did Could threaten damage to the Emperor's causeâ Only fulfill'd an act of private duty, To her whom once he served! Why should he die For that? What reason that a giant hand Be laid on him to crush him to the grave! A breach of duty were true duty here, Where duty, done, is breach of all things, else. For all thou say'st, I can't believe he'll die, Knowing, as I know, he has no right to die; I'll see my father. Iden. Counsel treason to him? Adol. That is not treason, which is not unright! [Goes out. Iden. Her virtuous will, will never own a let; What it desires, she ever counts upon The power to do. [Listens.] Ha!âNow she pleads to him. That were well urged, if earnestly were well!â I do not hear his answer, but by the tone 'Tis âNo!â She comes to the attack again! A friend in need, Adolpha, with a chance In thy favourâHere thou hast none!âAgain, I guess His answer by the tone!âHe will not yieldâ Nor still will she give upâNo advocate Like one that pleads with heart!âWhat! Tears?âI'm sure She weeps!âThis rain, Adolpha, won't avail! Duty 's a stern defendant; thou must lose Thy suit:âHere comes the governor!âKind heart! What sun is there!âNo cloud can keep it out; But, lower it ne'er so thick, some beam breaks through. Enter General Kleiner. Gen. Kle. I can't endure it!âwon'tâGive me a siege, With a starved garrison and gaping breach! Foundations honeycomb'd with mines!âthe foe A hundred men to one!âOr give me a battle With bayonets cross'd, and cannon, mouth to mouth, And I'm myself! I know my duty, and Can act the man!âBut save me from the eyes Of a woman, when she weeps, and I the cause, And cannot stop her tears!â'Sdeath! would they drown me, I'd thank them! In the name of patience, why Cannot one make a woman list to reason? Why does that drive her mad which keeps us sane? Talk reason to her, and her wits are gone! 'Sdeath! I can govern Prague; but not a woman! Iden. Why, what has happen'd, General? Gen. Kle. Don't call Me General!âcall your wife General!âshe knows My duty better than I know it myself! Tell her of customs, order, penalties,â You talk of things that she can treat as the thread She cuts with her hus'ife scissors! I have served For fifty yearsâfor more than half that time Have managed men by units, tens, and hundreds, And tens of hundreds!âI can't rule a woman! Rule her?âThat's not the question!âWould it were! She must rule me! Iden. But what's the matter? Gen. Kle. Matter? That wife of yoursâthat girlâthat waxen dollâ Adolpha! Is she not your wife; and don't You know it? Did you ever say her ânay,â And prosper?âever know her to give up The point her heart was fix'd on? She'd make hay In December! Marsâa profitable wife! She'd have the Helder thaw with a north wind In January, when the frost is biting With all its teeth! She'd stop the tide half in, When it runs strongest. She would stop the sun, The moon, and all the stars! Iden. What has she done, sir? Gen. Kle. Desired me ope the prison-door that's shut By the Emperor's orderâlet its tenant outâ Laugh at the warrant for his death, that's seal'd By the Emperor's hand! When I refuse her thatâ Which, did I grant her, I should lose my head, And that were falling somewhat grievously Short of my due proportionsâshe insists Upon a respite, while she goes herself To plead his cause before the Emperor! She'd do it! And when I refuse her that, She prays me set my wits to work, and pass A fiction off for factânot killing him, Although he seem to die! She'd make me out A necromancer! When she's balk'd of thatâ Which on as valid reason I refuse As one to weave with gyves upon his hands, She opens on me volleys of loud sobs, With showers of tears, that try my mettle more Than hail of lead! I wish you'd rule your wifeâ Cut her right short, when she's unreasonableâ Say âNoâ to her, and nothing else for a year! You spoil her, Idenstein!âA woman never Should have her own way! Iden. Sir, you gave it her Before I did. Gen. Kle. A fool, sir, has a use! He is a beacon to a man, that's wise Enough to profit by him. Iden. All her fault Is but excess of too sweet nature, sir, Which ever makes another's griefs her own. Gen. Kle. And mine, too! Punishment is done away In Prague! Offenders 'scape, or I must smart For their penalties! Nor ends it there. No ache, For ten miles round, but I must share a twinge, Chance it to come unto her knowledge!âI Expire with woes of orphans, widows, maids Forsaken, wives in childbirthâall degrees Of human, female sufferingsâI am in Articulo mortis, every day of my life, And not a pang my own! Iden. And then you die, sir, A good man's death with benisons all round you! Gen. Kle. I'd waive the benisons to 'scape the death! Iden. IndeedâI know you better, sir!âyou would not. Gen. Kle. I would!âBut who comes here? Iden. As I believe, The daughter of the prisoner, sir. Adolpha Has promised her an audience. Gen. Kle. We are attack'd In flank and rearâTell her it won't avail! Persuade her to retreat! Say we have taken Our ground, and we will keep it, stand or fall! Iden. Had not you better do it, sir? Gen. Kle. Not I! I'm a recruit, against their mode of fighting. [Retires hastily, and sits down near a table. Enter Meeta and a Servant. Serv. [Speaking low to Meeta.] I'll tell her you are here. [Goes out. Iden. You wish to see The daughter of the Governor? Meeta. I come To see her. I am promised I should see her. She said it, as I am inform'd,âindeed As I am sure she did. She is a lady: She cannot break her word. A noble lady, She would not break her word! A lady, sweet And pitifulâshe will not break her word! Iden. She will not; but I pray you for her sake, Absolve her from it, and forego your suit, Which will avail you nought. It will not lead To what you want; what is the worth on't, then? And wherefore shouldst thou urge it? Meeta. I am come To see the daughter of the Governor; Come on her promise, as I have been told, And thou just now hast granted. If she wills To break her word, then as I came I go! But if she waits for me to give it back, She'll wait till I am deadâand then she's free, As death solves all accounts. Iden. Why give her pain; And bootlessly? Meeta. My father is in prison, And he is doom'd to die within three days, And I his child, with the faculty of speech, Stand not acquitted if I hold my tongue; But, could I find for it no audience else, Must make it ring to stones for mercy to him While yet he breathes! how then should I be dumb To human hearts, that are not hard as stonesâ At least should not be so. Iden. Leave me to plead Thy cause to her. Instruct me what thou'dst have, I'll urge it to her, and with reasons back Which thou wouldst never dream of,âbe there but A glimpse of hope, I'll see it and point out, And make it clear to her, and if her heart Misgives her, I'll encourage her. I'm her friendâ Her husband. Meeta. You are not my father's child! You would give up, where I would still go on! That which would make me plead the heartier, Would silence you! O, sir, in such a case, Would you petition for your father's life At second-hand? But help me! O do that! And I will pay you with a life of thanks! And pardon me that I reject your counsel.â I cannot take it, sir!âIndeed I cannot! My heart, and mind, and sense, are capable Of nothing but one thingâto try all means, However light or weighty, feasible Or unfeasible, rational, or wild, or mad, Allow'd or disallow'dâshort of a stain Would spot my soulâto save my father's life! Gen. Kle. 'Sdeath! am I chain'd here, that would be hence, Yet lack the power to go! Iden. The lady comes. Soâspeak to her, since you will have it so. Enter Adolpha and Servant, who goes out. This is the daughter of the prisoner. Meeta. [Running up to Adolpha, and kneeling.] Bless thee! Adol. Poor girl!âNo! Not thy knees!âThy arms! Here are mine. Meeta. O no! my knee! my knee!âOr would you lift My body up, lift first my heart, that's low As misery can lay it! I have a father, And he's in prison, and I must not see him. I am his only child, and I have travell'd Hundreds of miles, and when I reach the gate, 'Tis shut on me, and human beings keep it! He dies on Saturday, and they can tell me I shall not see his living face again, And nothing has he done why they should kill him! Nothing!âno more than you have! An old man With a pale brow, sweet face, and silver hair, That would not hurt a fly!âand he must perish, And no one to console him, and his daughter Within the wall's breadth of him;âShe must not touch him, See him, or speak to him!âYou are a child! You have a father! Think of me and mine! Speak for me! Will you? Pray the Governor To bid him let me in and see him! Won't you? Are you going? Will you speak for me? Will you get them To let me see my father! Doâor here I'll lie at your feet for ever! [Falls prostrate. Gen. Kle. Idenstein, Can't you stop crying? Iden. Sir, can you? Adol. [Going to General Kleiner.] My father! Gen. Kle. I'll not be shaken. [Crossing herâshe holds him on the other side, kneeling to him. Meeta. [Partly raising herself and missing Adolpha.] Has she gone to do it, Or means she to escape me?âHa! she's there Kneeling to some one!â'Tis the Governor! MercyâOâmercy! Gen. Kle. They are taking me By storm! The citadel is theirs! I see No use in holding out!âEh! Idenstein? Must I surrender? She shall see her father! [Meeta falls swooning at his feetâPictureâScene drops.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Outskirts of General Torstenson's Camp. Enter Rodolph, Gerold, Lodowick, and others.âSoldiers dragging in Joseph. Ger. He is a spy! Lod. Drag him along to the guard. Let him be tried at once and executed. Ger. Nay, kill him without trial. He's a Jew Blasphemer, reprobate, extortioner! Jos. Nay, sirs; but hear me! Rod. Hear him.âLet him speak. Give him fair play. Ger. Fair play, and to a Jew! Jos. You give a thief fair playâa murdererâ And why not me, who neither kill nor steal? Ger. Not steal! Rod. Have patience! Jos. Have I stolen from you? What have you lost, to lay to my account? Is it your charityâI have it not; But I will spare you some of mine! Perhaps The stock to serve a Christian may be small, Yet such as 'tis, it would not let me use A Christian, though a thief or murderer, As you use me! Ger. You hear him! Leave him, sirs, To me. I'll do his business! Jos. A brave man! Ger. Leave him to me, sirs; I account a Jew But as I would a rat! Jos. Obey him, sirs. Let go your hold of me, and loose the rat, Before that dog! I have known a cur to turn Before as small a thing! I mean it, sirs. But as you leave a rat to use his teeth, Nor arm the dog you set upon a rat, So that, whate'er the odds, 'tis bite 'gainst bite,â Give me equality of weapons too, Hand against hand, at large, and arm'd or not, And see, if, be the Jew indeed a rat, The Christian nearer doth approach the man! Rod. The Jew has fairly said. Jos. Will fairly do, Give him fair play! Sirs, you are Christian men! A Christian father lies in jeopardy In Pragueâa reverend teacher of your faith. Man hath summ'd up his days; the number's out On Saturday, unless Heaven sends him aid; He has an only daughter, who essays To succour him, and spies salvation here, But cannot come to bring'tâa Christian tooâ So she must send for't; and thereto employs A friend, whose counsel, coffers, roof, hands, blood, She has, and welcome too, at her command; And Christian menâYou, sirs!âwon't suffer him To do her will, because he is a Jew! Ger. We knew not this! Jos. You would not know it, sirs! You would not hear me!âwould not let me speak! Laid you not hands upon me one and all? Vied you not in reviling me? with death Did you not threaten me, nor till now give time, To put a word of deprecation in, Because I am a Jew! Lod. We have wrong'd the Jew. Ger. I fear we have. Rod. Nay, sirs, I know we have, So let's ask pardon of the honest man. Jos. Ask me no pardonâIt is given, ere ask'd. A venial fault 's atoned for, when 'tis own'd. And pray you, sirs, if you have friends yourselvesâ As friends, however fenced in this world, lie Within the leap of dangerâbring me straight To one call'd Roselheim, who beareth rank Among your forces. Rod. Here the very man Comes, as he knew your need. You'll not complain? Jos. I never break my word, although a Jew. [Rodolph and the rest go out Enter Rupert, Madame Roselheim, and Esther. Do I not speak to Major Roselheim? Rup. You have named me, friend! Jos. Thanks, sir, to call me so. Rup. You have an errand for meâhave you not? Jos. Yes; but a messenger more welcome far Than I, this letter, sir, will tell it youâ I say more welcomeâthough it brings bad news. Mad. Ros. From Meeta, is it not? Rup. Yes, mother. Mad. Ros. What Says Meeta? Rup. Presently!âI'll tell you all Anon! Mad. Ros. I read the letter in your face; The old man's doom is seal'd,ânot quite, but yet Almost as sure? Rup. You have guess'd it, mother. Mad. Ros. Rupert, Is there no chance for him? Rup. There is a chance. Mad. Ros. What is't, my son? Rup. I may not tell you, madam. Mad. Ros. Were it a breach of confidence? Rup. No, mother,â Of duty only. Movements, which are language To a soldier, give me hopes, and these I am free To share with you, and do soânot their cause. Mad. Ros. Tell me his plight in every circumstance. Rup. Learn it in one, he dies within two days, Unlessâ Mad. Ros. What, Rupert? Rup. Learn the rest from hope! Mother, you said the Governor of Prague Was schoolfellow and choice comrade of my father, From boyhood even to majority,â That golden age of life, when hearts that join Are riveted by metal, weatherproof, That shines and keeps, while those it holds decay. You would have sent to him; nay, gone yourself; But, save in extreme need, I would not have it. Send nowâindite a letterâstate your claim, And crave delay to the last fraction Of time that duty will allowâand let Our Esther be the bearer, under guidance Of this good man. Come there no other profit, 'Twill place her nearer Meetaâshould she need her. She ne'er divines my care had conn'd this news. [Aside. Before this herald brought it. Mad. Ros. Esther! Esther. Madam? Mad. Ros. Fear you to go to Prague? Esther. To no place, madam, For you. Mad. Ros. 'Tis with a letter to the Governor. Esther. I'll take it, madam: I'll do anything To leave the camp. Mad. Ros. Why, what's the matter, Esther? Esther. That boyâthat Hans, is going fast to ruin. Before they stop, they'll make a soldier of him. Already has he got their swagger, madam; Drinks, swears,âyes, madam, on my life he does! I'll never take the poor lad home again The simple thing he was. Mad. Ros. Then, Esther, take The boy along with you. Esther. I thank you, madam!â Not that I care for Hans; but innocence Is a rare thing, and should not be corrupted, While those who know its value can prevent it. So as you think it right that the poor lad Be placed in safety, while it can avail him, I'll take him with me, madam. Mad. Ros. Do so, Esther; Go, find him straight, then come at once to me. [Goes out. Rup. I have a charge for thee, concerning Meeta; But this at onceâshould any one you love Remain in Prague on Friday night, take care They keep the house. You understand me, Esther? Esther. Humph! Yes, I think I do! But where is Hans? Upon my life, I quite forget myself With care for him. It fits not he and I Should go together, and be nothing more Than Hans and Esther! I have quite forgot Appearances. And what will people say? Here's a dilemma! If I leave the lad Behind me, he is ruin'd. They'll be putting, 'Mongst other things, sweethearts into his head. And I am ruin'd if I take him with me, And he no right to me, nor I to him! I could not pass him for my brotherâNone Would credit that the selfsame mother bore us! 'Tis out of nature he could be my son. What shall I do for sake of the poor lad? There's no contrivance I can hit upon, But to make Hans my husband. Well-a-day! To think that ever it should come to this; But, if it can't be help'd, as well be done To-day as this day year. 'Tis very plain I must be sacrificed, or Hans be lost,â And that were crueltyâThat must not be! And so my mind's made up! I'll marry him! SCENE II. âAnother part of the Camp. Enter Hans and Rodolph. Hans. And you have been in battle? Rod. Yes. Hans. How often? Rod. A dozen times. Hans. And never got a wound? Rod. Only a scratch. Hans. I would not mind a scratch,â I would not mind a dozen scratches! If It went no further, bayonets and swords To me were things I'd take no more account of Than pins and needles. Where, though, was the scratch? Rod. In the left sideâa bayonet grazed me there. Hans. Odds, that was near! Wasn't it? Very near! I should not mind one in the foot or leg, The hand or armâbut when you come to that, Fighting is very dangerous! I don't think That I should like to be a soldier. Rod. Yet You are the very cut of one. Hans. The cut? Am I though? Rod. One could see it with half an eye. Hans. It must be very plain. Rod. You were intended, By nature, for a soldier. Hans. Isn't it strange That nature never told me so? Rod. She left you To find it out yourself, it is so plain. Hans. And I to live to five-and-twenty years And not to see itâNo!âNor any one To tell me on't till you did! Rod. Friends are few; One may go far ere find one. Hans. Tell me what You mean by the cut of a soldier, that hereafter I know myself. Rod. A sharp eyeâa smart nose. Hans. Have I such eye and nose? Rod. You have. Hans. Indeed? I never dreamt on't! I have a smart nose And a sharp eye? Now would I give a crown That this were told to Esther! So! Go on. Rod. You have a pair of shoulders. Hans. La! you jest! Speak you the truth now? mean you what you say? Have I indeed a pair of shoulders? Rod. Yes. Hans. 'Tis plain I never knew myself before! A sharp eye, a smart nose, and pair of shoulders I wonder what would Esther say to this! Anything more? Rod. Ay marry! many a thing. A chest that's high and fullâa front-rank chest. Hans. Never mind thatâI like the rear rank better. Were I a soldier, I would always fight In the rear rankâI could do wonders thereâ Incredible and never-heard-of things! What call you those who fight upon their knees And stomachs, or ensconce themselves behind Hedges and trees, and when the enemy Advances, make a run of it, and leave The rest to fight the battle out? Rod. We call them Sharp-shooters. Hans. That's the very name! I'll be A sharp-shooter. A sharp-shooter had need Have a sharp eye, and I have one, you know: Haven't I? I'm contented with a chest That's high and full, but not a front-rank one: And so a sharp-shooter if anything! We've settled thatâGo onâWere Esther here! She little dreams that Hans is such a man! Rod. Your limbs are set right under you. Hans. They are? You do not say so? And have I got straight legs with all the rest? Odds what a man I am! I think I'll be A soldier. Rod. You'd be sure of it, but once You saw yourself dress'd in your uniform. Hans. 'Twould make a little change. Rod. A little, say you! 'Twould make a hero of you. Hans. I should like To see myself a hero! What was that? [A shot without. Rod. Only a shot. Hans. O, was it nothing more? A shot! I thought it was something else! Who minds A shot? Rod. 'Tis clear you do not. Hans. Noânot I! I fired a shot once when I was a boy, And kill'd a sparrowâas I live I did! I to be startled by a shot! [Shot again.] Odds life! That's shameful waste of powder, and in time Of war too. Rod. Here! put on this cap of mine, And show me how you look in it. Hans. I please you? Rod. Gods, sir, you make a show more warlike far Than would a whole platoon with shoulder'd arms And bayonets fix'd. Hans. What were I did you add My body to my head! Rod. To go by rule, You would be worth a regiment! How fine Your eye looks when it rolls! Here, take my sword And flourish it. Hans. What think'st me match to now? Rod. A whole brigadeâFootâHorseâArtillery, To sweep a field! Hans. I'll be a soldier. Estherâentering and aside. Esther. Hans! Rod. Then take the bounty. Esther. Take it if he dares! Hans. I never said I'd take it. Rod. But you said You'd be a soldier. Hans. Yes; with Esther's leave. Esther. O! was it so?âWhat do you with that cap? Take't off, or I will put one on your head Will fit it better! Flourishing a sword! Have you a mind the boy should cut himself, You man of war?âGive back the sword and cap. Sir, you may sell your own limbs if you like, You know the worth of them; but for the lad's, They're not his own; and not for market, sir. Rod. And is the bargain off? Hans. And don't you hear What Esther says?âIt were a valiant man Would gainsay her!âI would not for my head! Rod. [Looking alternately at Esther and Hans.] I see! Hans. We'll talk of it another time When she's not by. Rod. [To Esther.] Well I'll let off the lad, So that I get a kiss? Hans. [Placing himself between them.] You get not that! Nay, an I die for it, you get not that! Nay, an you come with swords and bayonets, Bullets and cannon-balls, you get not that! Esther. Hans is a man!âTake my advice, and know [To Rod. A lion without proving of his fangs. Touch me! and better for you you had been In prison-keeping than at large to-day. Man never kiss'd me yet, sir. Hans. Only Hans. Esther. Nor e'er shall kiss me, sir! Hans. Save I'm the man. Esther. I like a smirking swaggering turkey-cock, That eyes a woman, as he need but look And swallow her! Rod. I'll see your spark again. [Goes out. Esther. See he don't prove a fire and scorch you, sir! Hans, you have acted like a man to-day, You're a good lad; but you were never made Match for a world like this, to get through it, By yourself.âA pity 'tis you have not aunt, Sister, nor mother, that would look to you, Nor honest woman that might serve for such, And, maybe, love you better! Hans. Esther!âEsther! Esther. Why, bless me, Hans! you're always saying that, 'Tis very plain there's something you would have, But what that something is, not quite so clear; Speak out, Hans, and take heartâI cannot read The stars, you know; I'm not a conjurer, Or a diviner, or a doctor, who Finds hidden ailments out. I'm nothing but An honest simple woman, that would do A kind turn for thee, knew she but the way; So want'st thou anything, speak out, good Hans. Hans. I want a wife. Esther. You do not say so! Hans. Yes, I do.âNow, wanted you a husband, Esther, How well we should be match'd! Esther. I want a husband!â But, then, you want a wifeâthat makes a change. And though I do not want a husband, Hans, Yet I might bring myself, you know, to take one, To save the wits or life of a poor lad Like you, that has no mother, sister, aunt, To look to him! Know you where bides the chaplain O' the regiment? Hans. I do. Esther. I'll talk with him. Do you not lead the way? What, are you not in haste to get a wife? I thought you were. Hans. I am; but am so pleased, I know not what to do!âto go or stay, To laugh or cry, to talk or hold my tongue. Esther. Poor honest lad! A pity 'twere the world Should take thee in! Thou ought'st to have a wife, If but to look to thee! 'Twould not be right To leave thee without one, a day, an hour; And such a friend as I'm to thee, at hand. Would it, Hans? The poor lad! he's quite confounded! How interesting does he look!âCome, Hans! You know the way to the chaplain'sâI believeâ I thinkâI'm almost sure I'll take you, Hans! [They go out, Esther leaning upon him. SCENE III. âThe Fortress of PragueâA Room. Gen. Kleiner [without]. Wait you without. Adol. [without]. We will, sir. Gen. Kle. [without]. Idenstein, Keep guard upon her. Iden. [without]. There's no need, sir. Gen. Kle. Noâ A wife most docileâlet her have her way! [Enters with the Lieutenant-Governor. Bring here the prisoner. Do not say 'tis I That want to see him, nor apprise him how I am accompaniedâ [Lieutenant-Governor goes out. I had hoped this task Would have been wholly spared me,âso relapse Of consciousness succeeded to relapse, When nature once gave way, till nearly half The interval that spares him life was out. But she recovers and at once demands Fulfilment of my word.âWhat now my course? A veteran take the field without a planâ Or take the field at all with mutiny In the ranks! How come I here? What brought me here? A regiment of foot, or horse, or what? Can I believe I came of mine own will? With aid of mine own limbs, when I would be A thousand miles away? I must be mad,â I, that can't bear to see a caged bird! Mad for a hundred ducats! I would give That sumâay, twice as much, to any one, Would bind me hand and foot and take me hence! [Re-enter Lieutenant, with Muhldenau. Lieut. The prisoner. Gen. Kle. Leave us, good Lieutenant. [Lieutenant goes out.] Sirâ Muhl. Your pleasure? Gen. Kle. Pleasure, sir? I have no pleasure! I'm an unhappy man, that with the power To do his pleasure, cannot do it, sir. I know the track I ought to take, and would, Yet always go the way that's contrary. Sir, were a fever next door to me, and I knew removing further would prevent me From taking it, I would remove next door! There is in some men a fatality That knowledge is more loss than profit to them; For what appears their bane as clear as day, Is ever sure to be the thing they do,â As sight of a descending shell, 'tis known, Will fix the man, who sees it, to the spot, Where he is sure to die, with limbs at large As his that walks or runs. Muhl. I know you, sir! The gracious man they took me first before, Who pitied me; with patient audience heard me; Enjoin'd them gently to entreat me, and, Far as their duty warranted, to make The pains of bondage light. Gen. Kle. Have they obey'd me? Muhl. They have. Gen. Kle. You want no comforts they can give you? Muhl. They have done all they could to comfort me, And Heaven has done the rest. I am to die On SaturdayâI ask'd not at what hour? Will't please you tell me, sir? Gen. Kle. Sir? Muhl. I perceive It gives you pain to do't. Don't heed, for meâ He feels not death that uses life to die! The hour, sir? Gen. Kle. Nine o'clock. Muhl. What kind of death Am I to suffer? Gen. Kle. Sir? Muhl. I merely ask, Because there's something in the form of death To poor humanity, however brave To meet it. I would know it ere it comes,â Look at itâmeet it with accustom'd eye,â Not to be startled by it at the time I should be all myselfânot that I trust In my own strengthâI have a firmer stay. What death am I to die?âIs't by the sword? Gen. Kle. It is! Muhl. I'm sorry, sir, to give you pain. Gen. Kle. Sir, I can fight!âI love the fight. I think The blast of a trumpet music!âBeat a drum In concert with the shrill throat of fife, And my heart dances!âIt is mirth to me To hear the running roar of musketry From wing to wing, along the blazing line! And when the cannon thunders, clap on clap, So thick, there's not a breath of pause between, I tower as I myself could rule the bolts! I have seen death on every side of me, And given it not a thought! I have ta'en wounds, And never felt them, in the battle's heat! But I can't bear to look upon a man About to die, and in cold blood! I own I am a coward there! Forgive me, sir! Have you a friend, sir, whom you wish to see? Muhl. Is there one near me? You're a merciful, Considerate manâyou would not, idly, raise a hopeâ You would not raise but to kill it straight! Sir, I had learn'd to think a boundary, 'Twixt me and all things living 'neath the sun, Was drawn, and no more to be cross'd by me Than the dark frontier of the grave, once pass'd! But you have breathed a word, and it is gone! I have a child, sir!âIf she knows my plight, She's here in Prague!âshe's at my prison-door! Is she?âIs it of her you speak?âThat sobâ In the next room! Is it my daughter's heart That's bursting there?âIs it?âMy Meeta!âCome!â Thou know'st thy father!âFear not for himâCome! He has strength enough to bear the sight of thee; But not to want it longer, when he thinks Thou'rt near him! Come to him! ComeâCome! my child! [Meeta enters, rushing into her father's arms; Adolpha and Idenstein following. Meeta. You bear it, father!âSee!âand so do I! O, I was right!âNo door that man can shut, But Heaven can open! Day succeeded day! In vain chance, chance; and mock'd me still! Yet, spite of all, I cherish'd hope, nor suffer'd it to dwindle; And 'tis fulfill'd! I have pass'd your prison-door! I see you!âhear you!âI am in your arms! [Muhldenau and Meeta retire. Gen. Kle. What can Adolpha mean, and Idenstein? What can they be about? What do they mean By staying here? Why don't they call me hence? How cool they stand!âHow very cool!âwhile I Am writhing!âAy!âA pair of callous hearts! They would be thought to weepâand if they do, They like it! Cough, and seem to wipe your eyes! Do! Can't you go, if you can't bear it? Don't You know there is a door? and can't you go, And take me with you?âIdenstein!âAdolpha! Adol. Sir! Gen. Kle. Madam! Iden. General! Gen. Kle. Sir!âI hope you're pleased? Adol. At what, dear sir? Gen. Kle. To see two human hearts Bleeding, that you stay here as you were wood, Or lead, or stone, instead of flesh and blood! Adol. We thought your duty, sirâ Gen. Kle. My duty!âPshaw! You know you never let me do my duty! Adol. We will withdraw, if you will let us, father! Gen. Kle. âLet us!ââYou never do but what you're let! [General Kleiner, Idenstein, and Adolpha, move softly towards the door. Muhl. Who is that? Meeta. Which? Muhl. She that's moving towards the door! Meeta. The lady that obtain'd admittance for me. Muhl. Bid her stop! Meeta. My father? Muhl. Lady, stop! The face, Well as the form!âI saw thy mother's form, And now I see her face! Do you not see Your mother? Meeta. Father, you forgetâShe died When I was but an infant! Muhl. True!âYou're right! I had forgot! Then see your mother nowâ As she was at your age, Meeta!âYes!âmy child! Meeta. Sir!âFather!â'tis the daughter of the Governor! Iden. His mind is shaken by imprisonment! Muhl. No, sir! my heart is struck!âstruck by the form And face of one that's deadâlong deadâyet stands Alive again before me! Meeta. Dearest father, It is the daughter of the Governor. The Governor that's there! Muhl. I beg her pardon, I beg her pardon, Meeta, yet I feel, As I were asking pardon of my child. Sir, were those eyes your wife's?âThose perfect arches, As though Art set a copy unto Nature, To try her cunning!âand that domy forehead Of feeling, speaking marble!âand the rest O' the features, with the form therewith consorting! Were they your wife's? If so, they once belong'd To mine!âI cannot look on her and think She's not my child. [Turns up. Iden. Why are you lost, Adolpha? [Aside. Adol. I cannot help it! I am strangely moved. [Aside. Iden. At what, my love? Adol. [aloud]. To hear a father's voice, As never did it sound to me before! Muhl. What saidst thou, Meeta? Meeta. 'Twas the lady spoke. Muhl. The voice too! It recalls to me my home, As from my hearth it cameâmy very hearth! But she's the daughter of the Governor! [Retires to the back of the stage, and sits. Meeta. As drops his heart the hope, mine takes it up! Gen. Kle. Idensteinâ Iden. Sirâ Gen. Kle. Let us go. Iden. Adolpha! Meeta. Stop! No!âNot a trait! No more resembles him Than I!âwhile as I look at her, methinks, Touches, as of a face I can't recall, Yet feel as once I knew, start forth from it! You're troubled, sirânor yet are you at ease, [To Idenstein. So many tokens call him owner, yet The precious thing that bears them not his own! Incredible! impossibleâmy heart Protests against it!âyearns for her! cries out She's his and mine, and will not be gainsaid! Are you the daughter of the Governor? Adol. I amâI am his only child!â Meeta. You are! I kiss your hand and ask your pardon! butâ What scar is this upon your wrist?âNo knife Could make this wound, and in your father's house How came you by it? Was it by a knife? Adol. No, by a sword. Meeta. When? Adol. When I was an infant. Meeta. Where? Adol. At the siege of Magdeburg! Meeta. The siege Of Magdeburg! How came you there? Adol. I know not. Meeta. [To General Kleiner.] Sir, are youâ Are you her father?âIs he, her father? [To Idenstein]âBoth Look doubt at one another! Providence! What can this mean? Why are you silent, sir? If she you call your daughterâLook at me! Don't turn away!âIf she you call your child Was in the siege of Magdeburg, I lost A sister there.âIs this she? O, a word To save my heart from bursting! Her nurse, whose hand I held by, carried her,âa soldier seized The woman by the hairâ Gen. Kle. I smote him down, And saved the child! [Muhldenau rushing forward, throws himself at the Governor's feet, clasping his knees.] Meeta. 'Tis she! She's ours! She's found! My sister! Muhl. Meeta! Thy sister! What! in one another's arms! Give her to me! Meeta. Here, take her to thy heart! Into it, father!âSister!âFather!âHeaven! [Muhldenau and Adolpha embraceâMeeta rushes up to them, and kneeling, clasps them both.âAct ends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âA Room in Joseph's House. Enter Meeta and Adolpha. Adol. What place is this, and wherefore am I here? Meeta. Art thou afraid of me, my sister? Adol. No. Meeta. Then fear not where I bring thee, nor the cause. O! my new other self, were it a time, I'd give thee vouchers of heart-coin'd words To prove thy safetyâgood of every kindâ Dear to meâworlds, ay, worlds beyond my own. Dost trust in me? Adol. I do. Meeta. Wilt do my biddingâ Wilt do't to-night, however questionable Inexplicable, strange? Adol. Your words are darkness, Which yet I trust myself to, with your looks Of Truth and Love for guides. I'll do your will. Meeta. My sister, my dear sister, let me think, And lay your cheek the while a space to mine; There, there, thou prompt'st me sweetly with the touch Of thy sweet cheek. I have comfort for thee, sisterâ Our father will not die. Adol. How know you that? The Governor has heard no tidings yetâ The distance greater, than his courier, Despatch'd on the instant, with the prayer for mercy, Could compass in a day! Meeta. He will not die. Adol. My sister! Meeta. What! Adol. Your words are oracles I trust to, with a thousand human fears To shake my heart. Meeta. Our father will not die! Now listen. There will be a storm to-nightâ Fierce rain with deluge, high uprooting wind, Thunder and thunderbolts. Look in mine eyes, And let them serve thee for interpreters, To make my dark words clear. 'Twill break around Our father's prison. There its rage will play, Nor, till it bursts an entrance to his dungeon, To set him free, stop smiting! Canst thou read, Without a glossary? This house will be Beyond its range! Adol. My husband, and my father!â I cannot help it, he has been my father In all things but my blood! Meeta. There's nothing wrong. 'Tis very right. I'll call him father too; So think him, feel him too, for thy dear sake. And now thy promise, sister! Weigh my words. Thy husband and the Governor might fall; Here they are safe.âDon't interrupt me, sister, Time's brief and swift, and action must be instant, Or not at all.âThou must indite a letter, Urging their prompt attendance hereâaloneâ On matter of as pressing moment as Question of life or death. I know the thought Thou wouldst give utterance toâ'Tis not an act Of treachery, but duty! Thou didst promise Obedience to me. Adol. Hardly dost thou task me, But I'll respect my word. Meeta. Then prove it straight, Sit down and write the letter. O, my sister, Confide in me! Do it without stint!âwith cheer!â That's rightâyou will!âgo on! Adolpha writesâEnter Joseph. Jos. The trusty friends I told you of are come. Meeta. I thank you. Armed? Jos. A weapon each beneath his gaberdine. Meeta. How many are they? Jos. Twenty. Meeta. That is right; Their number makes resistance idle. Yet As courage does not take account of odds, And slightest scath, to them, were wound, to us; 'Twere well they should disarm your visitors On the unprepared instant. Is it not strange I grow more calm as the dread crisis comes Of this momentous night? You are aware Whate'er befals, the motive of the act Holds you absolved;âbesides, it is not yours, But mine! Jos. I take it all on mine own head. Meeta. There mustn't be a light when they come in, Lest it betray thy friends! Go send me now That servant of the Governor who came Along with us. Is't written, sister? Adol. Yes. Meeta. Thank you, my sister; now direct it. Enter Governor's Servant. Sir, seek straight the Governor, and give him this. [Servant goes out. Now, sister, come, and be thou strong of heart: I'll give thee clearer reasons, on the way. This night of death shall bring us days of life. [They go out. SCENE II. âAnother Room in Joseph's House. Enter Hans. Hans. I wonder when the honeymoon begins! I'm one day married, and no glimpse on't yet! Or shall I ever have a honeymoon? Or is there such a thing? Until I see it, I'll not believe it. Twenty leagues of travel Is not a honeymoon! Strange company, That care no doit for me, nor I for them, Are not a honeymoon! A dinner snapp'd, Not eaten, can't be call'd a honeymoon! 'Tis Esther's fault! No sooner were we married, Than off she sets for Pragueânor leaves me choice, Except to stay behind, or come with her. Of course I do the latter, as beseems A married man. I know my duty, but I see no honeymoon, or chance of it! No merry-making!ânot a soul I know To give me joy! No presents, visitings, Feastings, and dancing, as, I know, are wont At other people's marriages, with scores Of little tricks and rogueries they play. I have not had a laughâand here I'm left, Five hours alone! Is this a honeymoon! And if it is, I would I ne'er had been A married man! I'm fit to hang myself! Esther. [Entering.] Husband! Hans. Well, wife? Esther. You look not happy! Hans. No. Esther. And why, dear chuck? Hans. Because I am not so. Esther. Not happy! Hans. No. Esther. Why, am not I thy wife? Do I not treat thee kindly, lovingly? Do I not call thee hubby, spouse, and chuck, And every other kind of tender names? What want'st thou to content thee, dearest love? Hans. I want a honeymoon. Esther. A honeymoon? Why this is it! 'Tis on, my honey-love, And almost all to come. Hans. 'Tis on? 'Tis not! Be this the honeymoon, I'm sick of it! I want no more of it! Will have no more. Esther. O cruelâcruel Hans. Hans. If I had thought To pass such honeymoon as this, I ne'er Had married. Esther. Would you have me break my heart? Hans. I have no comfort with thee! Esther. Do I live To hear thee say so! Hans. No delight in thee! Esther. No, Hans? You'll make me wish that I were dead! Hans. I took thee for a helpmateâthou art none! I scarce set eyes upon thee! Thou art out, Five hours and more, and hast not told me where. Esther. I went on business, Hans, that's not my own. Hans. Thou hast no business with such business! Fit I mope at home, and have a wife that ought To keep me company! I'm fairly turn'd From honey into gall! What business was it, Took thee away? Esther. I may not tell. Hans. You must! Esther. I won't! Hans. I'll show her, I'll be master! Now, Or neverâI'm resolved! One whisper'd me, As from the chaplain's we came outââBeware!â Look to your wife, sir!ââ'twas the corporal who Had, ne'er, beguiled meââmind! or she'll put on What is no proper part of woman's gear!â So I'll begin in time! What bus'ness was it Took thee away? Esther [gently]. I will not tell thee, Hans! Hans [angrily]. You won't? Esther [more angrily]. I won't, Hans!âMind what you're about! You know me! Hans [angrily]. Yes!âbut yet you know not me!â I will not have it!âwon't allow it! Esther. What? Hans. To have thee gadding in the honeymoonâ If honeymoon it be! Esther. If honeymoon It be? Hans. I say it is no honeymoon!â Where is the wine?âwhere are the cakes?âwhere are The sports and games?âwhere are the friends and neighbours? Why are we here, and not in Mariendorpt? I thought we should go thither, when I made A wife of thee! Esther. You made a wife of me? You say it, sir?â'Twas I made you a husband! Hans. And if you did, I'll keep myself a husbandâ I will be master! Esther. Hear him! Hans. Lord! Esther. O dear! Hans. And lord of that, I'll not be left alone, Again!âI won't!âto fret myself from wine To vinegar! Esther. Look, sir! Hans. Look, ma'am! Esther. I tell youâ Hans. And I tell you! Esther. I'll make you know yourself! Hans. You will?âI'll run away to Mariendorpt! Esther. [Frightened.] You won't, dear Hans? Hans. I'll be divorcedâI will! Esther. You'll kill me, Hans! Hans. I'll take another wife! Esther. [Crying.] O dear! O dear! Was it for this, I let you win my heartâ O'ercome my hatred of your tyrant sexâ And, from my state of happy singlehood, Transform me to a miserable wife?â O Esther! Esther!âwoman never knows When she's well off, until she is undone! Hans. Don't cry! 'Twill spoil your eyes! My wrath is soothed, I'm your own Hans againâyour loving Hans! I'm pacifiedâI'm calm'd. The storm's blown o'er; All's smooth and still, no ripple now, nor breath. Esther. I'll tell thee all, Hans. Hans. No, you shan't!âI say I will not hear a wordâa syllable, As I'm your husband.âLet her have her way, So that she keeps to wearing her own clothes! Esther. I thank you, Hans. I see you love me still. Hans. Love you?âAdore you!âIdolize you!âBut 'Twill never do to want our honeymoon! [They retire. Enter abruptly General Kleiner and Idenstein, followed by Joseph. Gen. Kle. What means this violence?âWhat men were those Disarm'd us in the hall? The lady where, That sent for us? Jos. No ill is meant you, sir, But good. The men disarm'd you, are your guards, Trusty for you, to death. The lady's gone. Gen. Kle. 'Tis all thy wife's contriving, Idenstein. Iden. You know the value of a thousand ducats? Jos. I do. Iden. I'll give you them to set us free. Jos. Took I the sum, 'twould be to peril that Were worth it to you, countless timesâyour lives! Iden. Our lives! Jos. They are in my care. Gen. Kle. Look, honest friend; Wilt thou consent to set us free at once, There's not a unit in two thousand ducats, But I will count thee down. Iden. Thou art a Jew, And wilt not list to reason? Jos. Not such reason As that. There's not in Prague that bulky sum Could weighâthe matter of a lineâthe scale Wherein my pledge to keep you here is putâ My loveâmy gratitudeâmy principleâ Which I respect, my lord, although a Jew! Gen. Kle. Dost thou reflect that I'm the Governor? That I can punish thee? That I can throw thee Into a dungeon?âput thee to the rack? Load thee with chains, consign thee to the galleys?â Hang thee, good Jew? Jos. I know it very well. I know thou hast the power, although thou lack'st The will, to execute a cruel deed; And when befits the penalty to fall, Usest the keen sword with a melting eye. Every one knows the Governor of Prague! Gen. Kle. Every one knows him for the fool he is! Jos. Although I am a Jew, I honour you, sir. The hospitality I force upon youâ Except compulsionâI have taken care Should stand acquitted of all disrespect. That room presents refreshmentâthat beyond Repose. This night alone you are my guest, And shall, to-morrow, fully learn the cause Why you are here; and then be free to go. So pray you find contentment, if you can, Where profit cannot come of discontent. [Goes out. As Esther and Hans are following, Idenstein beckons the former. Iden. Hark you, fair lady, you are beautiful. Esther. I know I am. Hans. She knows she is. Iden. She is; And beauty argues goodnessâand if goodness Be not made up, 'mongst other precious things, Of generosity, 'tis negative, And proves of no account! Hans. What's negative? Iden. A diamond necklace clasp'd around your neck, A score of ducats for each several drop, And each the twentieth fraction of the set, Would not be out of place.âIs there a window Whence one might drop himself into the street? Hans. No, there is not! You put no necklace, sir, About her neck! 'Tis mine, and not her own! Go, Esther! Esther. Sir, I am not to be bribed. Hans. That's rightâbut go! [Esther goes out. Iden. You are her husband, friend? Hans. I am. Iden. And well she chose you. Hans. So she did. Iden. Art thou in service? Hans. Yes. Iden. Wouldst thou not rather Be thy own master? Hans. Who would not? Iden. Wouldst like To be a hero? Esther [without]. Hans! Hans. I'm coming!âYes, [To Idenstein. Knew I a way, was safe. Iden. You have a scruple To be a soldier? Hans. A small scruple. Esther [without]. Hans! Hans. I'm coming. Iden. Would you like to have a farm? Have your own serving-men and serving-maids? Keep your own swine and kine? Ride your own horse?â You'd look a man on horseback! Hans. So I would! Iden. All these are thine, wilt go an errand first. Hans. Where? Esther [without]. Hans! Hans. I'm coming, Esther. Esther. Come along! Hans. Where? Esther. [Appearing at the door.] Hans! Hans. I'm coming, Esther. Esther. Come at once! [Pulls him off. Iden. We are a pair of birds, sir, in a cage. Gen. Kle. Birds?âWe are fools! This comes of my good-nature! It still has been my ruin! I was made A dunce by my mother, for my fondness of her! What lack'd in spoiling me, aunts made upâ I was so docile, biddable to them! My sisters brought me to destruction by Improving my good temper, which they made Their ready scape-goat in all kinds of scrapes; And which their gentle friends in dimity Employ'd, to get me into divers straits, From which to extricate myself were only Entanglement anew! My wife completed My ruin! My sweet disposition made her So fond of me, to please her I would feign Sickness, that she might play my nurse. One thing Alone was wanting to my quite undoingâ A child, and that, as nature would not find me, I must provide myself withâthy Adolphaâ Who, for her own ends, keeps us prisoners here! What's to be done? Iden. To bear what must be borne. They, that command us, are a host to one. Gen. Kle. Let's in, then, and submit. Iden. I follow, sir. Gen. Kle. No fool, so trick'd as a good-natured man! [They go out. SCENE THE LAST. âA Dungeon. Muhldenau asleep on a couchâMeeta sitting near, with Adolpha kneeling by her, sleeping with her head on Meeta's lap. Enter Lieutenant. Meeta. Softly!âThey sleep!âYour news is bad? Lieut. It is. The answer is arrived. With fruitless search They have sought the Governor. Not finding him, On me, as second in command, devolved The painful task to break the packet open, Which gives no hope of life. Meeta. It was expected: We are prepared.âSo, please you softly tread, As you depart again.â[Lieutenant goes out.]âHe has awaked her!â Sleep, sister, sleep! Adol. [Starting.] What time of night is it? Meeta. It is no longer night, but morning, sister. Adol. Morning? Meeta. The chimes of a new day have struck Again and yet again! Adol. How often, sister? Meeta. Thrice. Adol. It is very still. Meeta. Too still, but we shall hear The sound of stirring shortly. Adol. You are sure? Meeta. I am. Adol. You comfort me!âyou are so calm! Meeta. Sister, we both had need be calm!âLook there! Adol. How sound our father sleeps!âKnows he our hope? Meeta. No!âit might draw his thoughts from better hope: From hope that doth ever in possession end; Hope that hath naught of earth in it, to crumble I' the grasping. Sister, you don't know my father!â On earth, he has lived in heaven;âDon't fear for him! He is that happy man, who is prepared To live or die! Adol. He will not die! Meeta. Speak softly! He is awaked! It can't be help'd. Dear sister, Let it not melt thee, should he talk of death. For tears are catching things, and nature's nature, Long as it breathes. Let's countenance the calm Which his pure spirit keeps. Muhl. Meeta. Meeta. Here, father. Muhl. What, both my children!âboth!âAdolpha, too! Is not this merciful, to have you here? That my last earthward sigh I am permitted To breathe upon your heads in blessing you? What is the time, my Meeta?âHow far on Is my last day within this prison-house? These walls of clay, in which the spirit's pentâ That's going back to him who lodged it here! 'Tis nothing else! How easy, then, to die, To him who thinks it so! What is the time? Meeta. Another day is onward. Muhl. To that window Comes the first beam that's herald of the sunâ See if there's sign of the fair messenger, Or shall I do't, my child? Meeta. No, father. Muhl. Well, How is it?âIs there mark on the horizonâ A blending as of light with darkness, or Something that's plainer?âTell me, child! Mine eye Is fix'd on day, to which noonday is night! Meeta. 'Tis early morningâa dun glowâalmost A streak. Muhl. The boundary of yesterday Is cross'd some hours. Come hither, both of you. Kneel down! The longest time that man may live, The lapse of generations of his race, The continent entire of time itself, Bears not proportion to eternity, Huge as the fraction of a grain of dew Co-measured with the broad unbounded ocean! There is the time of manâhis proper time: Looking at which, this life is but a gust, A puff of breath, that's scarcely felt ere gone! Then comes a calm that lasts. My youngest one, Least known, but not less lovedâMy Meetaâ Meeta. Father, Am not I part of both? Muhl. My noble child! My Christian-trainÃ©d child! I did thee wrong To fear exception thou mightest take at that Which made my children equal. My found one! My blessings on thee full as upon her, That never left my side. Join hands with her! Love her for ever! as thyself. Two hearts That join in truth, become a wall of rock, 'Gainst which the surges of the world may lash, But only break themselves. Adol. I hear a noise! 'Tisâ Meeta. Sister, peace. What heeds a noise? Muhl. I think I heard it tooâand understand it; but Whate'er it is, it matters not to me. I seeâthe light comes on. Meeta, my child, Thy father gives thee thanks for hours and hours Of happiness. You have let fall her handâ Take it againânever let go the love That now unites thy sister's hand to thine! And take thy father's blessing, free and full, Which Heaven attests that thou hast merited, Who never wast but dutiful to me! [Noises nearer. Adol. Hear you the sounds again, and louder? Meeta. Peace! Dear sister, if it is to come, it will. [Noises again, and nearer yet. Muhl. What, Meeta? These are not accustom'd sounds. There is a shining something in thine eye, That looks like hopeâand thine, my other child! My children! is there hope? I'm human still! I'll live for you, my children.â[Noises again.] Those are shouts. They move not with such sounds who come to see The spectacle of an untimely deathâ For human nature, howsoever wild, Is human still. [Noise very loud, as of a general attack. Meeta. Yes, father, there is hope! Enter Lieutenant. What come you for? Lieut. The prisoner Meeta. For what? Lieut. To place him in securer keeping. Meeta. Hence! He's in his children's armsâor leave him here, Or take us altogether. [Shouts, and reports of musketry and cannon. Soldier enters. Soldier. You are call'd for [To Lieutenant. To look to our defence! They come upon us A thousand men to onceâthe castle's lost! Adol. He's savedâ Meeta. Not yet! [Noise as of something giving way and falling. Adol. Hear youâThey burst the gates! Meeta. It may be something else. Muhl. Ah, now to dieâ [Noise as of people ascending. Were pain! Adol. The rush of steps! Rup. [without]. Burst in the door. Meeta. 'Tis Rupert's voiceâMy father's savedâHe lives! Rup. [Bursting in with others.] My Meeta! honour'd father!âwe have come With life and liberty! Meeta. We thank you, Rupert! Rupert, I knew you would not let him die! How far is Prague your own? Rup. This quarter, Meeta, Which yet commands the rest! This post was long Our general's aim! yet he so doubtful kept His eagle hovering, the mighty pounce Your strait accelerated, none could guess, Until his fated quarry felt its power! Meeta. Send trusty friends, and strong, along with me; Speak not, but let thy answer be the act. Rup. Dismiss your care! It is not needed, Meeta. The faithful Hebrew met me in advancing, And took in charge a chose band to watch Success, and bring thy friends to thee.âBy this I doubt not they are hereâ Enter Joseph, conducting General Kleiner and Idenstein. The Governor? Gen. Kle. Yes, sir,âbut not your prisonersâthat honour These ladies claim. Adol. Forgive us, father! Gen. Kle. What! Now thou hast found thy father? Adol. Father still! Muhl. Give me the Hebrew's handâthe Christian's friendâ His elder brother, though with difference. Jos. All men should thus be brothers. Hans. We shall have Our honeymoon at last. Esther. Be silent, Hans. Meeta. Let all be silent, save the grateful hearts, That speak in humble confidence to you. [To the audience. END OF THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT.</field>
