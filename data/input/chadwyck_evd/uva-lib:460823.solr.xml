      <field name="fulltext">VIRGINIA. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Appius Claudius. Virginius. Icilius. Marcus. Numitoria. Virginia. People. Lictors. Followers of Icilius. Slaves of Marcus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Forum in Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Numitoria, Virginia. Nu. What thus delays thee? Come: to our abode Let us return. Virginia. Mother, whene'er I pass This forum, recollections deep and lofty Delay my progress. It was in this place That erewhile thunder'd from Icilius' lips The sentiments of freedom: heard no more: Absolute power long since has made him mute. How just are both his anger and his grief! Nu. To-day, perhaps, to his so many griefs May yield some solace, if he truly love thee. Virginia. To-day? ... If he sincerely love me? ... Speak! ... Nu. Virginia, yes: at last thy father hears, And grants fulfilment to thy fervent wishes: He from the camp has written, and proposes Himself to accelerate thy nuptial rites. Virginia. Is it then true, that, of my lingering hopes, I gain at last the object? Dearest mother, How happy thou hast made me! Nu. To Virginius, Not less than to thyself, for a long time Icilius has been dear: they both are Romans: And are so more by actions than by name. It was not ever possible for thee To fix more loftily thy partial fondness Than in Icilius' heart: nor did thy father, Till equal to thy beauty was thy virtue, Affiance thee to him: he would thou wert Worthy Icilius, ere Icilius' spouse. Virginia. And does he think me so to-day? oh joy Immense and unexpected! To obtain A husband like Icilius, seems to me The first of every blessing: yet it is A far superior blessing to deserve him. Nu. Thou meritest his hand; and he alone, Of all the Roman youth, does merit thine; He that dares shew himself a Roman yet, While Rome debased in guilty silence stands Astonish'd, and, though plunged in servitude, Thinks herself free. Ah, were they like to him, Th'illustrious traitors to the commonwealth, Who, while with exultation they recount, Disgrace, the achievements of their ancestors. Sense, virtue, valour, uncorrupted faith, Have, in Icilius' bosom, found a home. Virginia. He is not noble, that for me suffices, Nor to the tyrants of his country sold: Hence is he grateful to my unspoil'd heart. Upon his liberal, enterprising brow, I see the magnanimity enthroned That designates a genuine son of Rome. In these degenerate times, when even they Who flatter, tremble, his intrepid speech, His unperturbed heart, his noble rage, These are the qualities by him possess'd, Which have enthrall'd the affections of my heart. Myself plebeian, I dare boast myself The equal of Icilius; I should weep, Since I were then to him inferior, Were I from noble ancestors descended. Nu. Thou didst imbibe, e'en with thy milk from me, A detestation of patrician blood. Foster that hatred; 'tis their due, who are, As prosperous accidents, or adverse, rise, Now proud, now humble, always infamous. Virginia. Shall I belie my birth? Thou know'st not, mother, A cause, which that magnanimous contempt In me redoubles. I will now relate Some private injuries hitherto concealed. Nu. Let us meanwhile press forward. Virginia. Thou shalt hear To what this beauty, only prized by me, Since grateful to Icilius, hath exposed me. SCENE THE SECOND. Virginia, Numitoria, Marcus, Slaves. Mar. This is the damsel. Slaves, without delay, Drag her to my abode: she, like yourselves, Was born my servant. Nu. What is it that I hear? And who art thou that dar'st to designate As slave, a Roman lady? Mar. Thy deceit Is known, and vainly wouldst thou rescue her From her predestined servitude. Her birth To thee she owes not, neither is it free. I also am a citizen of Rome; I know, and fear, and I observe the laws; And from those laws the courage I derive, That which belongs to me to take by force. Virginia. I born a slave? Am I the slave of Marcus? Nu. She not my daughter? Thou perfidious wretch, Dar'st style thyself a Roman citizen? From thy flagitious actions, and thy words, I take thee for a satellite of those Who now oppress their country, and of these The most degraded. But whoe'er thou art, Learn that we are plebeians, of a race Unsullied; that all violence and fraud From infamous patricians, and their clients, May be expected here: and, further learn, That of this maid Virginius is the father, And I the spouse of that Virginius; That for his native Rome, now in the camp He toils in arms; that he may well suffice To disconcert thy impious hardihood ... Mar. And that, deceived by thee, he deems this virgin, Purchased illegally, to be his child: Nor hath he known, nor knows, the art by which Thou hast imposed on him a child not his. But thou shalt hear me, in a fitting place, Proofs irrefragable of this adduce. Meanwhile my slave shall be reclaim'd by me. I am no liar, nor Virginius fear: Beneath the sacred guardianship I stand Securely, of inviolable laws. Virginia. Mother, and shall I lose thee, and with thee, My sire, my husband, and my liberty? Nu. I call to witness Rome, and all her gods, She is my daughter. Mar. Thou in vain dost swear; In vain defiest me. Without delay My slaves she follows; or, compell'd by force, She shall go hence. If so thou wilt, hereafter, Before an uncorrupt, supreme tribunal, To give an ample reason, I am ready For what I've done. Nu. Thou deem'st thyself more strong Than powerless women; hence thy hardihood: But with impunity thou shalt not now Adopt coercive measures. Ill, I warn thee, Ill chosen is the scene for infamy: This is the Roman forum; know'st it not? Retire; the multitude will flock together At our laments: of virgin innocence Avengers rise by thousands and by thousands. Virginia. If no avenger should espouse my cause, Blood-hounds, you should be forced to slay me here Rather than drag me as a slave. I am, I feel, the daughter of a lofty sire: I feel my Roman and my free-born heart Bound high within my breast. Far different, Far different were that heart, if sprung from one Vile like thyself, I were a viler slave. Mar. Quickly shalt thou resume thy servile thoughts Amid thy native fetters; by one stroke Thy fate, and thy deportment, shall be changed. Meanwhile, in contests frivolous and vain, The hours pass on. Nu. Together with my daughter I would be led. Virginia. No violence shall tear me, Oh mother, from thy side. Mar. Vain is the struggle. From her false mother, wrest by violence The fugitive slave. Virginia. If there be pity in you, Rescue me, valiant Romans. Nu. Generous sons Of Mars! this virgin, whom I clasp so fondly To my maternal breast, was born, like you, Free and a Roman: shall these impious slaves Tear her from me by force? before your eyes? E'en in the midst of Rome? and in the presence Of our most sacred temples? SCENE THE THIRD. Icilius, People, Numitoria, Virginia, Marcus. Ici. What disturbance? What screams? oh, heaven! what is it that I see? Virginia! Virginia. Defend me ... Nu. Heaven has sent thee; Run; fly; with danger imminent thy spouse Is threatened. Virginia. I am torn from thee, my mother, And from myself. That man has vilified Me with the name of Slave. Ici. Of slave? oh vile! Are these thy noble enterprises? Thou, Art thou more skill'd to combat in the forum Than in the camp? Oh! of all slaves the worst, Dar'st thou to stain this maid with servitude? Mar. Icilius, thou accustomed to debates, Fostered in discord and fierce turbulence, It well becomes thee, that, to awaken tumults, The food congenial to thy wrathful nature, Thou shouldst assign this frivolous pretence. But since, in spite of thee, there are at Rome Most sacred laws, what cause have I to fear thee? She is my slave; yes, she; once more I say it; And I, to whom it most imports to prove it, Will prove her to be so. Nor thou, I deem, Nor those, like thee, whose contumacious scowl Bespeaks their factious nature, are my judges. Ici. Icilius, and a few like him, here stand Tremendous advocates of innocence. Ye that are Romans, listen to my words. I, who have never forfeited my oath; I, who have ne'er betray'd or sold my honour; Who equally exult that I possess Ignoble parents, and a noble heart; Listen to me; to you I speak. This virgin, Free-born and innocent, is Virginius' daughter ... At the mere mention of that name, I see A noble indignation in your eyes. For you Virginius combats in the camp: Oh see on what degenerate times we have fallen! Meanwhile, exposed to shame, exposed to outrage, His child remains in Rome. Who is the culprit? Come forward, Marcus; shew thyself ... But what? Thou tremblest? ... Look at him, ye know him well; Chief minister, and vilest satellite, Of Appius, the arch-tyrant of our times; Of Appius, mortal foe of every virtue; Of Appius, the oppressor, harden'd, proud, Ferocious; who your freedom has destroy'd; And, to increase the insult, spares your lives. To me Virginia was betroth'd; I love her. Who I, that thus address you, am, I think 'Tis needless to remind you: I was once Your tribune, your defender once ... in vain: For rather did ye trust the blandishments Of flattering words, than my sincere reproofs: We now receive for this our punishment, Our common servitude ... Words here are useless. Well as ye know his name, the arm, the heart, The hardihood of Icilius ye know. Free, at your hands, do I demand my spouse. He asks her not of you; calls her his slave, Seizes her person, drags her on by force. Which is the liar, Marcus or Icilius? Give sentence, thou, people of mighty Rome. Mar. Those laws, oh sovereign people, which ye framed, Tremendous, wise, and sacred, dare ye be The first now to infringe? No; for the gods Of Rome will not permit it. On my head, Then, may the weight of your resentment fall When I am convicted as an unjust claimant: But while that vain boasts, and atrocious insults, And horrible contemptuousness evinced Towards supreme, legitimated power, Are the sole arms by which I am opposed, Say, which of you will venture from her lord To force his rightful slave? Ici. I first; and I Shall have as many comrades to this deed, As there are Romans here. Thy fraudful claim, Doubtless, some impious mystery conceals: Now, by what reason thou art thus impelled Who knows? who can, who would, know it? not I; I only, that the infamous effect Shall not ensue. Rome, since she fell a prey To the detested ten, under pretence Of law, enough already hath endured From force, from shame, from slaughter. Hitherto I am not used to outrage: who endures, Deserves it. Never can she be a slave Who is affianced to Icilius; ... never, E'en were she born a slave. Was ever law Like this unjust? Slaves in the very lap Of liberty? And slaves to whom? ... To what? ... To the insulting pride of our oppressors. Slaves are not for the people; not for us; Who have both hearts and hands. But let this Rome Have slaves by thousands, and by tens of thousands, So that Virginia be not of the number, Romans, meanwhile believe me: I affirm She is the daughter of Virginius: Her modest gestures, and her face declare it; Her lofty feelings, and her ripened sense. I love her; she is destined to be mine; Shall I thus lose her? People. Miserable husband! And who can tell who instigates this man? Ici. Oh! I perceive ye feel compassion for me; And I deserve it; on the very day When I believed that I, of all my hopes, Had gain'd the summit, see, I am at once Plunged in the lowest depths of misery. I have abundant enemies in Rome; And all your enemies; powerful enough, But still more cunning. Who can tell? Perchance, First having robbed me of my liberty, They now would rob me of my wife. Behold Their hardihood! Fables they first invent; And this man comes to give their lies a substance ... Ah, native Rome! to what art thou condemned? ... Flagitious nobles, you are here the slaves: Ye should be laden with opprobrious fetters; Ye, in whose bosoms, fraud and cowardice, Avarice, ambition, find a fit abode; Ye who by envy are for ever gnawed, Malice, and jealousy, and rancorous hate, At our plebeian virtues, by yourselves Not only never practised, but unknown. Ye persecutors, clench our galling chains, And doubly captivate the multitude: The impious slavery, the woes of all, Rather would they behold, than share with us The sweets of liberty: by nature cruel, To them our joy is grief, our grief a joy. But that the times will change, I hope; and may The day for this be near. People. Oh, were it so! But ... Mar. Cease; no more: wouldst thou, perhaps; again Create thyself a tribune of the people? Blood and sedition, more than aught, I know Are grateful to thy nature; but may Heaven Forbid to-day that I should be to thee The means of such calamitous effects. Practise on these, and artfully infuse Thy poisonous influence; to its virulence No other remedy will I oppose Than what the laws provide. I summon you, Virginia I summon; and, with her, Her falsely seeming mother, to appear At the tribunal before Appius: There not fierce turbulence, and frantic howlings, But tranquil reason will decide our cause. SCENE THE FOURTH. Icilius, Virginia, Numitoria, People. Ici. To the tribunal I myself will lead her. Romans (I now address the few, the free, And the courageous) you, I hope, will be Of this great cause spectators: I invite you: Our final litigation this will be. Hence will each husband, and each father learn, If he a wife or daughter have in Rome. SCENE THE FIFTH. Icilius, Numitoria, Virginia. Nu. Disastrous times! Days for degenerate deeds! Oh, wretched mothers! ... Virginia. In thine eyes, oh spouse, But for my father I had had no value. Now I am bereft of him, how shall I dare Proclaim myself thy wife? Ici. Thou shalt be ever Virginius' daughter, and Icilius' wife, And, which is more, I swear to thee, a Roman. To be the faithful partner of my fate Thee have I chosen; equal to myself In virtue I esteem thee. To my lips Phrases more soft than this love dictates not; My arms, my heart, if need there be, will give Proofs more conclusive of my tenderness. But can ye guess the motive that impels That miscreant thus to insult thee? Virginia. Say'dst thou not He is the creature of the tyrant Appius? Ici. The servile tool of all his inclinations. Virginia. The reason then is too well known to me. For a long time, with a flagitious love, Has Appius burned for me ... Ici. What do I hear? Oh insolence! ... Nu. We then are lost. Oh heavens! Ici. I live; and I have yet a sword. Fear not, Oh ladies, fear not while Icilius breathes. Virginia. Listen, and shudder at his guilty boldness. Oft has he tried to practise on my virtue By circumvention, or seductive arts. Menaces, promises, prayers, flatteries, gifts, Whate'er is deem'd the price of chastity To base patricians, he to me has offered. Th'insufferable, and atrocious insult I long dissembled: in the distant camp My sire was stationed; and in vain, from me, Alone, and powerless, had my mother heard it. But now my lot assumes a different aspect: I am thy wife, I am no longer silent. Oh thou, the noblest of the Romans, thine Not only is th'offence, but thine the vengeance. Rivers of tears I silently have shed; My tender mother often wept with me, Pitying my grief, though ignorant of its cause. Behold the horrid secret. Appius adds Fraud now, and violence, to his former arts; He is at once the plaintiff and the judge: I shall be taken from thee, ere I can Be thine: ah grant, at least, that he obtain me No otherwise than dead! Ici. Ere thou be his, Or ere he shed thy blood, shall Rome behold Herself with blood inundated: my blood, And that of every hero, shall be spill'd. To those who fear not death, and who is Appius, But one, and one the lowest of mankind? Nu. Appius, alas! too much surpasses thee In artifice. Ici. Though cruel and unjust, Appius has hitherto at least preserved The exterior of equity; all Rome Will be assembled at th'important cause: We need not yet despair. We stand in need Of fortitude and judgment: above all The father here is indispensable. The camp is not far distant; it shall be My first solicitude to reconduct Him here without delay. Let us go hence; Meanwhile, to your abode I am your guide. A solace to you, ladies, sad, 'tis true, But yet the only one that I can now Propose to you, be the assured conviction, That, if a path to justice is not opened, Our swords, I swear, shall open one to vengeance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Appius. Ap. What is this, Appius? Thou with frantic love Inflamed? ... With thy high projects for a throne Dar'st thou to mingle an ignoble fondness For a plebeian damsel? ... Yes; since she Presumes to turn a deaf ear to my prayers, It now becomes a necessary step To power supreme, to make her yield to force. But yet the people ... why should they alarm me? Beyond all credence are the foolish people Affrighted at the laws: If I beneath The shelter of those laws to such a pitch Have risen, to-day they surely may defend me; First to create, and then abolish them, Or bend them to my purpose, I have both The power and skill. Much art it will require To consummate my scheme of power; but less Than I possess. 'Twas easier far to me, Haughty patricians, to make tools of you, Whose only passion is a lust of gold, And sooner gold itself would be exhausted, Than in yourselves the avaricious thirst: With this I've gorged ye, though not sated yet; And, for the present, instruments I've made you For the destruction of the multitude: For your annihilation afterwards The day will come; a light task this will be To him who has bought, oppress'd, degraded you.â But see, Virginia comes to the tribunal; With her, her mother and Icilius are, And a vast multitude! A haughty train; And perhaps a fearful one to any man That were not Appius; but the man who feels Within himself that he is born to reign, Whose will is fixed on empire, or on death, Can neither change his purposes, nor fear. SCENE THE SECOND. Appius, Icilius, Virginia, Numitoria, People, Lictors. Ap. What shouts are these I hear? and dare ye thus Approach the sacred decemviral throne? People. Rome asks for justice from thee. Ap. And I ask Respect and homage from the Roman people. Not less to check all popular misrule, Than for the safety of the people, here, With me, AstrÃ¦a sits: it seems to me That these tremendous symbols of my office, With which I am surrounded, silently Remind you of this truth. Do ye so soon Forget the sovereign power ye gave to me? Say, is not Rome's collected majesty By you to me transferr'd? Be pleased, I pray ye, To be respectful to yourselves in me. Nu. Appius, thine eyes behold a wretched mother, Whose only daughter a base miscreant Would tear from her embrace; my true-born child, Nourished by me, who in my sight grew up, The object of her father's love and mine. There are who dare asperse her with the name Of Slave, who seek, by force, to seize her person, To tear her from my arms. Th'unheard-of outrage Fills Rome with horror, makes it tremble, shudder, And drives me to distraction ... Here she is: This is the virgin; this my only hope: Great is her beauty, but her virtue greater. Rome knows our manners and our characters: There's nothing in us that resembles slavery. A most tremendous question by my means To-day will be decided: in the name Of universal Rome I ask it of thee, Are, or are not, our sons and daughters ours? Ap. A mother's vehemence in thee I pardon. To thee I make reply; and, with thyself, To universal Rome. Where there are laws, He need not fear who has not broken them. To tear from thee thy child, if she be thine, Would be a vain attempt. Within my heart Exists no motive to a partial verdict. Before this high tribunal, hitherto, No man appears proclaiming her a slave. But ye, who are ye? be he true, or false, Who is the imputed father of this damsel? Nu. Appius, and art thou ignorant? Behold her: Virginia is her name; a name derived From one her father, to thyself and Rome Well known; known better only to her foes. Of race plebeian are we, and herein Do we exult: free was my daughter born, Free shall she die. Of her unblemished birth It may be held by thee no doubtful proof, That of Icilius she's the chosen bride. Ici. Know, more than this, that to Icilius she Is dearer far than life, and dear as freedom. Ap. 'Tis now my wish alone to know if she Be free, or not, by birth. Being to thee Dear, and affianced, cannot change her lot. Thy scowling aspect, thy ferocious words, Imbued with bitterness, what can they do? Icilius and Rome shall quickly hear me, Whate'er she be, her destiny adjudge. SCENE THE THIRD. Marcus, Appius, Virginia, Numitoria, Icilius, People, Lictors. Mar. As it behoves a citizen, I come Before thy eminent tribunal, Appius; Few are there in my train; the crowd immense, Encompassing my adversaries here, Excites no terror in my steady heart. I adduce proofs and arguments; not cries, And force, and weapons. Appius nothing hears Except the right; and of my right it is No trifling proof, that these have first infringed All legal usage, and have, ere I spake, Sought to invalidate an unmade claim. Ap. True; this proceeding is unprecedented. Ici. But let us hear: do thou now state thy cause. Mar. That damsel, named from her pretended father, Was, from a slave of mine, born in my house. Hence, while an infant, by maternal fraud Withdrawn from me, and for a certain price To Numitoria sold, who cherished her, Instead of one, who, dying, left her childless. Virginius was the first caught by the fraud; Hence he believed her, and believes her still, To be his daughter. I have hither brought, And they alone escort me to this place, Persons who witnessed both the time, the manner, The price of this transaction. They are ready To ratify my statement with their oaths. Nu. Liars are always most disposed to swear. Should what a Roman mother dares t'assert, (Yes, Roman and plebeian) less be trusted Than the vile evidence of those who make An infamous traffic of their perjuries? At least, before these swear that which is not, For a few moments hear a mother speak. From my emotion, from my grief, my words, And from my gestures, let the people judge Whether or not I am the real mother. Ap. I here should judge, and all the rest be silent. And those especially, who, of revenge, Of love, or anger, instruments alike, And foes alone of reason, make themselves Of all these passions partizans in turn. These hitherto, too frequently in Rome, Justice have interrupted or destroyed. Ici. Say, is it just to silence evidence? That which to no man is forbidden, thou Forbiddest to a mother? Ap. Thou wilt, perhaps, Teach me to judge because thou wert a tribune? A private individual, like thyself, I too might feel compassion at the names Of mother and of daughter. As a judge, I must withstand these passionate appeals. Nor is it fitting that I should to tears, Or threats, here yield attention, but alone To Reason's voice. The claimant's proofs first heard, Then should I hear the feigned or real mother. This is the course of law ... but in the laws Ye place not now your confidence; I see it. Ici. Should we for ever hear the name of law, Now that the will of few is absolute? But since who breaks the law dares to adduce it, I also will adduce its usages, And say, that 'tis not lawful here to judge The daughter, in the absence of the father. People. Thou speakest well: the father should be present. Mar. The father, as erewhile I mentioned to you, Was never conscious of the mother's fraud. Ici. But I of yours am conscious; and if thou Dost not from thy vile enterprise desist, All Rome shall hear me, with a thundering voice, Quickly divulge your impious machinations. Ap. Icilius, be silent. What dost hope? In whom dost trust? In the seditious murmurs Of a few factious miscreants, who applaud Thy turbulent harangues? Oh fool, oh fool, How much art thou deceived! I on myself Alone repose; the love, e'en as the hate, Of those who call themselves thy partizans, Is ineffectual and precarious. The people, not the Icilii, I esteem; Their prating moves me not, their rage I fear not; And their offensive flatteries I despise. Ici. 'Tis well to scoff at those who must obey. But on the day, when thou, throughout this Rome, Intreated'st our vain suffrages; the day When thou from pride affected'st to be humble; Magnanimous from baseness; incorrupt, And just, and pious, from impiety; That day, in somewhat less audacious terms, We heard thee speak. To all of us, thou now, Appius, art known: thou hast made too much haste, Made haste incautiously, to reassume Thy real character; in all respects Thou of a tyrant hast the attributes, And, except prudence, all a tyrant's virtues: Yet prudence, to all virtues paramount, Was always held by men resembling thee, The key-stone to the arch of tyranny. People. He speaks imprudently, but speaks the truth. Ap. I thought to-day, to pass a sentence here Upon a slave; but now I clearly see That I must first pass sentence on a rebel. Ici. I here expected to defend alone The free birth of a maid to me betrothed: My rights, the rights of Rome, the rights of all My fellow citizens, how blest were I If I were able to defend to-day, E'en at the expense of my last drop of blood. People. Oh, spirit-stirring words! oh noble heart! He is a Roman. Ap. Lictors, stand around him: O'er his audacious head suspend your hatchets, And at the least attempt ... Virginia. It shall not be, Oh Heaven, no never! I will be his shield: Direct to me your hatchets: let thy lictors Drag me away a slave: my servitude Is a small evil, and my death is none, Provided that this hero be unhurt, Rome's last remaining champion. Ap. From his side Tear her away. A most portentous plot Lies here conceal'd, and threatens Rome with danger. Ici. This is a dagger for herself and me, If we are attack'd by force: no man shall dare, While I have life, t'approach us. People. He fears nothing. Ici. Thou shalt be forced to kill me, ere this virgin Can from this spot be dragg'd. Ah, Romans, learn The terrible contrivance here conceal'd: Learn with what instant danger Rome is threaten'd: And then let me be slain before your eyes. This Appius burns with infamous desires For my Virginia. People. He defies all fear. Ici. Tried to seduce her; menaces and prayers He used ... and sought at last with gold to bribe her: The extremest outrage that to abject virtue, Vice, when enthroned, dare offer. But her blood Was not patrician, thence above all price. Now he attempts to seize on her by force; And 'tis enough to certify the fraud To know the claimant's name: now for your children Tremble, oh fathers; for your wives still more Tremble, oh husbands. Now, what more remains That we can lose? Our ill-defended lives? But what is life, where honour and our children, Our country, and the heart that makes it dear, Our liberty, our laws, are taken from us? People. For us, and for our children, liberty Or death. Ap. This is a lie ... People. Or liberty Or death. Nu. Suspend awhile thy vehemence, Oh generous people. Ah! may Heaven avert That one, from me sprung, be the fatal cause Of shedding rivers of pure Roman blood. I ask alone, and in your name I ask it, That in this cause Virginius may be heard. From the insufferable, false aspersion, E'en in his presence, and before you all, If time be granted, I shall clear myself. Ap. Cease, cease your importunities, or I, The stern executor of the law, will shew That law in all its fiercest majesty. You rouse yourselves in vain to a vain task; There is no need of your audacious cries; They are as useless justice to obtain, As they are impotent to baffle it. Icilius lies, and I will prove it. He, Of every faction, every broil the head, Long has he panted to shed civil blood. He was your enemy, as he was ours, When he was tribune. To destroy the senate, Deceive the people, to vile servitude Reduce us all, was his flagitious aim: Hence towards us is his rage. It was your will To yield to decemviral hands the reins Of this most desolate and afflicted city: Weary yourselves of impious fatal discord, Ye made me what I am. Returning peace, So ardently desired, scarce lifts her head, And at a nod, a word, of him, the worst, The basest of the citizens of Rome, Shall I behold you eager for fresh tumults? People. 'Tis true; he is our judge: but let us hear The answer of Icilius. Ici. 'Tis true; A legislator and a judge ye made him; But for a year; already long ago His annual jurisdiction has expired; And since that period he hath made himself, By artifice, your judge, by force, your tyrant. Peace, universal servitude he calls: This is not peace, but a deep sleep of death. The blood of our best citizens in streams Runs in the camp: who, think ye, drinks that blood? Our enemies perchance? The valiant Siccius, He who dared in the camp invoke the name Of ancient liberty, did he not fall In a pretended contest, in the back, By an insidious decemviral knife, Transfix'd? Ap. The rebel Siccius presumed ... Ici. Why should I speak of murders? They are known. Blood they have not as yet diffused in Rome, But gold with lavish hand, which afterwards Will be the horrible price of human blood. He is accounted now a foe of Rome, Who, as a Roman should, both speaks and thinks. The virgins see themselves unjustly robb'd Of husbands, parents, liberty, and fame. What do ye now expect? The horrible yoke, Far worse than any death, upon yourselves By yourselves fasten'd; which scarce leaves to you Man's character, or prostituted name, Why falls it not to earth by you destroy'd? Say, are ye Romans? your professions still Are worthy of the name, but not your deeds. Say, is there need of blood to goad you on? Already in the tyrant's countenance I read th'inflexible decree of death. Ye satellites of blood, be expeditious, Why do your weapons slumber? Appius, this, This is the head, which, sever'd from my body, The liberty of Rome shall take away, Or ratify for ever. Appius, tremble While it remains there; thou shalt ever hear it Proclaiming vengeance, liberty, and arms. If Rome contain no Roman but myself, A second Brutus to a second Tarquin, Living or dead, am I. Behold, I fly not; I neither flinch nor tremble: here am I. ... Virginia. Oh heavens! oh, Appius, mitigate thy rage: Shed not his life-blood with your axes: hear; The people shudder, nor will they permit it. Thou menacest a life of too much value: Ah, take my life, the injury to thyself, To Rome, will then be less ... Ici. What art thou doing? Dost thou entreat? Entreat an Appius? And in the presence of myself and Rome? If thou dost love me, learn to banish fear: And if I here, as a first pledge of love, Should offer thee my life, do thou receive it As is befitting for a Roman lady, Freeborn, and to Icilius betroth'd. Nu. Oh dreadful moment! Appius, I pray thee Yet once, once more; summon Virginius hither; Let him be waited for, let him be heard. People. Appius, ah let Virginius be summon'd; We all desire it ... Ap. And I more than all: I wish him present here; so shall he be: I, in the forum, by to-morrow's dawn, Expect to meet you all. Although by law His life is forfeited, I do not now Condemn Icilius; ye might suspect That he alarm'd me: for the present then Be his life spared, and at the mighty question Let him assist; if so he will, in arms; And ye with him in arms. Ye first shall hear me Pass sentence on the slave, and then on him. To see this I invite you here; secure In his own virtue, Appius trembles not. Mar. But the law wills, that meanwhile in my care The dubious slave remain. Ici. The vile abode Of a bribed satellite, shall that e'er be Th'asylum of a virtuous virgin? ... Never! There is no law iniquitous like this; Or if there be, let it at once be broken. Mar. Who meanwhile will be surety for this damsel? People. All, all: we pledge ourselves. Ici. And I with them: Let us depart. To-morrow's rising sun Shall witness all of us assembled here, Sure of ourselves and of our wives, or dead. SCENE THE FOURTH. Appius, Marcus. Ap. She loves Icilius? and she is his spouse? Hence more inflexibly in my design And more immutably, shall I persist. Go, headstrong rebel, go, now in the people Trust, while I. ... Mar. Appius, didst thou ever see The people more inflamed, or more disposed To insurrection? Ap. Nothing did I see Except Virginia; and she shall be mine. Thou perhaps would'st tell me that I ought to fear? Dar'st thou say this to Appius? Did he, Who fear'd the people, ever govern them? With their first impulses to temporize; Their second to anticipate; to wear An aspect of perpetual defiance; Subtly with haughty threat'nings to mix Seductive flatteries: these are the chief arts By which I am now what I am; and here Greater than any man ere was before Shall make myself. Mar. So long as lives Icilius, In vain thou threaten'st or seducest them. In him, and in his ardent eloquence, His boldness as a tribune, they discover, Their ancient rights recalling, powerful fuel To feed again an unextinguish'd flame, Which now breaks forth in enterprizing breasts. Ap. While there remains aught else for me to do, Icilius shall live. 'Tis oftentimes Not profitless to make parade of mercy: Yes, let him live; and let the people see, How little he can thwart the schemes of Appius. Thou shalt behold that fickle people change Its timid love to hatred and contempt, And turn their weapons to Icilius' ruin. Yes, thou shalt see that very populace Made instrumental to his punishment. Mar. But ah, what courage to the multitude, What strength to Icilius, will not the return Of this Virginius bring? Ap. But the return Of this Virginius, Marcus, dost expect it? Come and behold, how, having once gain'd time, Appius to use it well, wants not the skill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Virginius. Virginius. At last I am arrived: and with what speed? It seem'd as if the pity of a father, Fear, hope, and love, had wing'd my very feet. My fears increase as I approach my dwelling. 'Tis almost night: I hasten to embrace, If I possess her yet, my only daughter, The only comfort of my weary age. SCENE THE SECOND. Icilius, Virginius. Ici. Oh! ... whom do I behold? ... Virginius? The gods of Rome have sent thee to our aid. Methinks thy coming here so rapidly Is an auspicious omen. Virginius. From the camp I fled, Icilius! ... Do I come in time? I scarcely dare to ask it, am I yet A father? Ici. Hitherto thy daughter lives Unhurt, and free. Virginius. Oh, unexpected joy! Beloved daughter! then I breathe at last ... Ici. Thou hast a daughter, but in tears she lives With her afflicted mother. They exist Trembling, of their approaching destiny In horrible suspense: alternately They, in their anxious bosoms, wish and fear The moment of thy coming. Virginius. Oh ye gods! Then ye have listen'd to my fervent prayers; Ye that have lent to my exhausted frame An unaccustom'd strength, by means of which I have arrived in time to save my daughter, Or for her to expire.â Ici. I also will Save, or die for her. But thou art a father; Thou hast a weapon not on me bestow'd, And with the people much may it prevailâ Paternal tears. Virginius. But say, of our affairs What is the posture now? Ici. The self-same spot Where now thou standest, was, this very morn, The scene of this iniquitous transaction. Here first we breathed defiance. Marcus spake, And, with a thousand subterfuges, strove To hide the cruel lust of Appius. Whate'er was needful to delude the people All was resorted to; bribed witnesses, Claimants, and laws, and precedents, and proofs. Already, in himself, the impious judge Thought, without obstacle, to pass the sentence. I dared the first to manifest the fraud, And for Virginia claim'd her father's presence. With what a terrible shout the people rent Heaven's echoing concave when they heard thy name! An unperturbed deportment he assumed; But in his heart, and in his every vein, Trembled the impious judge. At length he paused, And promised to await thee. Now I fear'd, That thy return to intercept, the wretch Might plant an ambush'd train; and thus, at last, That to thy daughter, to myself, and Rome, Thou mightst be ever lost ... At last thou'rt come, And not in vain, the gods thy safety will'd. He hath assign'd the sixth hour of to-day For the vile sentence: let the rising sun, Among the multitude, a trembling father, See thee then mix'd, soliciting with tears Thy genuine offspring. Nor do thou elsewhere, Save in the people's hearts, for pity seek. The people only to the father can Restore his daughter, to myself my wife, To herself honour, liberty to Rome. Virginius. Thou know'st, Icilius, how much I love thee ... My choice of thee to be my son proves this. Within my unspoil'd heart there yet remain Three objects of pre-eminent regard: Rome, my own kindred, and thy rectitude. I pledge myself, if need there be, to brave With thee each peril, each high enterprise ... But thy impetuous hardihood, thy soul Magnanimously prodigal of life. ... Ici. Can virtue then be carried to excess? Virginius. Yes, when 'tis vain; when it betrays to ruin Him who possesses it, and profits not Him who doth not possess it. I hear thee, Icilius, with a noble rage inflamed, Thy oppress'd country, and my injured daughter, In one confound. Ici. And should they be disjoin'd? The cause is one: thou art thyself a father, And dost not thou feel this? or Rome is Rome, Then thou hast there a daughter; I have there Life and a consort; or Rome is not Rome, Then we have nothing there except a sword. Virginius. But too emphatically now indeed Is Rome enslaved: I fear for her through thee; For every present shock exacerbates Her deep and dangerous wounds. I fear lest thou, 'Mid different measures, as the most secure, Shouldst chuse the most tremendous. Ah, could we, At once, my daughter rescue, nor disturb The safety of my country ... Ici. Hold thy peace: What name dar'st thou pronounce? Is there a country, Where only one rules, and where all obey him? Penates, children, honour, country, freedom, Once precious names, ah, ill do ye become The mouths of those who are, like us, enslaved, While that one breathes that makes us all his prey. Now slaughter, rapine, violence, and shame, Are inconsiderable evils; worse, A far worse evil is the palsying fear That weighs upon the universal heart. Scarce dare the anxious and mistrustful people Look at each other, much less converse hold: So deep is their suspicion and their dread, Brother fears brother, parents fear their children; The base are bribed, the good are overwhelm'd, The weak neglected, and the valiant slain, And all degraded: see what are become Those once proud citizens of Rome, of yore The terror, now the scorn of Italy. Virginius. Thy words are true, and from mine eyes they draw Not only tears of sorrow, but of rage ... But what, 'mid such a multitude of slaves, Can two alone perform? Ici. Avenge their country, Then die like men. Virginius. The recent tyranny Is not establish'd yet: we may attempt, But never can we consummate revenge. What cruelties, e'en in the very camp, Dare not the decemviri perpetrate? But yet the choicest of our warriors, Who there are station'd, arm'd, what do they do? They shudder, and they act not. I desire The lying allegations to confute, And save my daughter from the claws of Appius. If it be indispensable, I am Most willing, and I ought to die: not so For thee; if thou wert dead, who then remains To rescue Rome, or to avenge us? Ici. We: ... Living by arms, or by example dead. More cannot be endured: we have adherents; Though all may be enslaved, all are not slaves: The daring of the many stands in need Of one to dare the first; that one am I. This is the field in which we're called to fight; Here let us seek for honour or for death. In following longer our oppressor's banners, Thou wilt but purchase to thyself disgrace: Our foes are in the heart of Rome; in Rome Then let us combat; and although th'event Be deem'd precarious, certain is its glory.â Need I say more to thee? Virginius. No: I am always Prepared to die; and now I only grieve To have lived too long. I hope my passionate cries, And my conclusive reasons, will avail To check e'en Appius. Rome, meanwhile, shall see me Through all the streets, displaying to the people My bosom full of honourable scars: And Rome I will adjure, and all her gods; Adjure the blood which in her cause I've spill'd, Both of my own and of her enemies. Trembling and hoary, in a squalid garb, To every father I will tell the tale Of my misfortunes: finally, by me, Each warrior shall learn the recompence That Rome awards to those who fight her battles.â This, this I swear to do ... But oh, to stain My sword with civil blood, and to involve So many innocents in my hard lot, Involve in vain ... Ici. Yet, perhaps, thou wilt be forced To do e'en this: our children, liberty, Deserve, methinks, that we should shed the blood Of more than of one citizen. If they Die valiantly, they are too good for slaves; If cowardly, they merit not to live. But let us now press forward, to embrace Thy desolate wife and daughter. Sure I am, That thou, from their affliction, wilt derive A fury great as, greater far than, mine; And that in thee a comrade I shall find, Whatever be the enterprize. SCENE THE THIRD. Numitoria, Virginia, Icilius, Virginius. Nu. Oh sight! ... If I see well ... No, I am not deceived; 'Tis he, 'tis he: oh joy! Virginius! Virginia. Father! Virginius. Oh heaven! ... Daughter, ... is it thus? Consort! ... I clasp you to my bosom? Ah! I feel myself o'ercome ... Virginia. Yes, I embrace thee, Since I am allowed to call thee father. Nu. Anxious for thee, and doubtful of thy coming, A longer tarriance here was death to us; Hence we set out, impatient till we met thee ... Virginia. Trembling and apprehensive. ... Now at least Distant from thee I shall not breathe my last. I fear'd that I should never more behold thee. Ici. Afflicted father! he can scarcely breathe, Much less address you. Nu. Ah, how different now Is thy return to what it was before, When from the camp thou cam'st so many a time The conqueror of our foes? Bent to the earth, Now I behold, alas, thy honour'd brow, Erewhile with laurels, now with grief weigh'd down, And black and fatal thoughts: thou art reduced To such extremity, that thou dost wish Thou never hadst had either wife or daughter; Though formerly, alas, the much-loved objects, For whom thy glory and thy life were dear. Virginius. Ladies, to be a husband and a father, I ne'er shall grieve: most blessed are these ties, Although a bitter penalty awaits them. If it must be ascribed to guilt in Rome To be possess'd of children, I, in this, Would first be criminal, of this abuse Would first obtain redress. Upon the day When I became a husband, Rome was free. Free on the day, when thou didst give to me The sure and single pledge of thy chaste love, Mine own Virginia; yes, mine, too much! Born, and since bred, beneath the sacred shade Of thine own country's laws, thou wert, oh, daughter! My fondest hope: the magistrates were then The guardians of our lives, our wealth, our honour; Are they not now become their plunderers? Ah, daughter, ... check thy tears; compel me not To weep;âNot because weeping I esteem Unworthy of a Roman soldier; no, When tainted honour, or the outraged laws, Or a wrong'd daughter, from his struggling heart Wring the unwilling tear; but with these tears Redress is not procured. Virginia. And thinkest thou, Had I been, haply, of the stronger sex, That I, a child of thine, to those who dared Insult me with the epithet of slave, Had made rejoinder with effeminate tears? Weak, and a woman, am I; and I lose My consort, and my father, all, yes, all! ... Ici. Thou hast lost nothing yet. Hope yet remains: Us, and the people, and the gods themselves, Thou hast in thy defence: but if in vain, If there remain no means for thee t'escape, Except with us, thou die; ... I speak it trembling, ... Thy parents speak it to thee by their silence ... Thou, then, with us shalt die. Thy noble hand I with my sword will arm, with my own blood, Yet warm and reeking: and thou then shalt hear My last free words, recalling to thy mind, That thou wer't daughter of a valiant Roman, Thyself free, Roman, and my spouse. Oh thought, That freezes my sad heart! thank heaven, it is Yet premature. Virginia. It is the only thought That can sustain my life. Oh! if thou seest My tears, 'tis not my destiny I weep, But thine. For loftiest enterprizes born, Thou wert design'd to be the pride of Rome: I weep to see thee, and in vain, reduced, For my obscure and private wrongs to combat; To see, for thee, each path to real fame Closed up for ever; finally, to see In thee a soul so eminently Roman, Since Rome is now no more. Virginius. And thou art not My daughter? Let those hear thee who deny it! Nu. She is the prop of our declining age; The only prop. Oh daughter! I would die A thousand, thousand times, rather than lose thee. Ici. Beloved Virginia, strong that love must be That is express'd so strongly; of us both 'Tis worthy; similar to mine it glows. But these hard times forbid all interchange Of soft affection. Our sole mutual pledge, Of conjugal and of parental love, Must be a promise of united death. Virginius. Ah, my own children! ... must it then be so? And must such virtue perish? ... Numitoria, And those the real sons of Rome, and ours, That might from them be born, a generous race! Shall we ne'er clasp them in our tremulous arms? Oh what a seed of heroes dies with them, If plants like these, so noble, lofty, generous, Be doom'd indeed to perish prematurely! Ici. If we had children, we must weep indeed, But in another guise: to an extremity We should be brought, or forced to leave them slaves ... My children slaves! ... Ah! I would kill them first. I am not a father, if I were ... Virginius. Thy words Flash'd like a horrible lightning on my breast:â I do beseech thee cease. Nu. I am a mother, And feel what thou dost say in all its force. Reduced to tears alone, why have not we, Sad mothers! strength proportion'd to our grief. Ici. Fathers and husbands have like grief to you, And greater boldness. Still do I retain The hope to rescue her. Perchance alone, Virginius and myself in Rome now stand, But we suffice to rouse in a whole people Passion and life. Virginius. Alas! 'tis not in words, (However strong and passionate they be,) To rouse a people that in fetters languish; Or to elicit from their slumb'ring soul Actions of steady masculine revenge: Excess of injury and blood alone Can work this miracle in callous hearts. 'Twas indispensable to rescue Rome From th'impious Tarquins, that an innocent lady, Basely contaminated, by her own hands Should fall transfix'd on earth, in blood immers'd, Victim at once, and pledge of victory. Virginia. If it be requisite that innocent blood, But not contaminated yet, be shed, To rouse this people from its lethargy, Strike; husband, father, strike: behold the breast. Am I too dear to you? fear ye to plunge The weapon in my bosom? I fear not; Give, give the sword to me. Collected Rome My death shall witness: such a spectacle Will reillume their ancient love of freedom; The banner of revenge shall flout the air Empurpled with my blood: the men of war In it shall emulously dip their swords, And in the tyrants bosoms, to the hilt Shall plunge those swords anointed to revenge. Virginius. Ah daughter, ... what perplexity of dread, And new-born ardour dost thou make in me! Ici. Tear not by little and by little thus A father's heart already truly Roman. What boots it to exhort each other now To death? From our great ancestors are we Degenerate? We shall have ascertain'd, In a few hours, whether we ought to die. Thou, oh Virginius, with thy wife and daughter, Do thou return to see, once more, thy dwelling. This is the last night, perhaps, in which to thee So great a consolation will be granted. Ah, hapless father, transient is the time For the indulgence of thy deep affections! Virginius. Oh bitter night! ... Let us depart, Icilius; By dawn to-morrow thou shalt see me here. Ici. Here first shall I be to dispose a few, But hardy spirits, to sublime endeavour. Now go: thou also wilt be well convinced To-morrow, that no scheme remains for us, Excepting mine, of blood. Living or dead, Oh spouse, we shall be fully blest to-morrow. Virginia. With thee, living or dead, I'm always bless'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Appius, Marcus. Ap. Virginius in Rome? Mar. 'Tis but too true. Ap. Hast thou beheld him? Mar. With these eyes I saw him. Thou also wilt behold him here ere long, For he is seeking thee. Ap. How from the camp Could he depart, if an express command Of mine detain'd him there? Mar. Thy interdict Perchance arrived too late; the generals Perchance were loath t'enforce it ... Ap. The commands Of Appius, who e'er was loath t'obey? I rather guess Icilius forestall'd me ... Thence shall he reap the recompence he merits. Already, ere Virginia had been dragged To the tribunal, had a messenger Been to her sire dispatch'd. At his approach The aspect of our enterprize is changed: Yet not for this ... Mar. Already, bathed in tears, The parents, with their daughter, through the streets, Through every pathway, suppliantly run, Muffled in squalid garb, and in their course They leave behind a formidable track Of tears and indignation: here, perchance Ere long, thou wilt behold them. But in guise Far different to theirs, by multitudes, Encreasing instantaneously, begirt, The fierce Icilius, throughout the city, Clad in habiliments of battle, speeds. He menaces, adjures, exhorts, attests.â The mother's tears, the virgin's loveliness, The hoary valour of the warlike father, The factious outcries of their former tribune, A formidable aliment provide To a more formidable flame:âtake heed. Ap. Do thou take heed, and tremble for thyself; And if thou wilt, for me: since for myself I shall not tremble.âGo, I see Virginius Coming towards me; leave me with him alone. SCENE THE SECOND. Appius, Virginius. Ap. And darest thou thy colours and the camp Abandon thus? The Roman soldiers then Do now at will, come, go, or quit their posts? Virginius. There is a reason that might supersede The strictest laws. Yet in this exigence Those austere laws of military duty, Which I too long have kept, have not been broken. I ask'd for leave of absence, and obtain'd it.â I quit my station in my daughter's cause, And this thou know'st. Ap. What can'st thou say for her, Except that which the laws suggest to me In language more imperative than thine. Virginius. Hear me. I am a father to my cost! And as a father tremble. Unelated Do I behold the people crowd around me, And in my favour menacingly shout. I know thy power is great; that to attempt By force to cope with it were hazardous; And that I may precipitate this Rome In bitterest calamities, and fail To rescue from thy grasp my hapless daughter. Then, Appius, menace not: I know how far Thou hast the power to injure me; but think, Ah think a little, to what risk immense Thou dost expose thyself, if thou persist. Ap. Are these or prayers or menaces? Am I The sole and absolute disposer here Of what the laws decree? Have I the power To tear a daughter from her real father? Rather should I, and such is my design, Secure her to that father with my blood. What avail prayers, if she be not thy child? The rancour, which thy words but ill conceal, I know from whence it comes. Icilius, Thy heart hath clouded with his dark suspicions; He who makes calumny the instrument Of his ambitious views. To such a miscreant Canst thou yield credence? and canst thou, who art The most exemplary of citizens, Chuse for thy son-in-law the worst of rebels? Together with him wilt thou lose thy daughter? The ruin of Icilius is decreed; And as he hopes to have, he will not gain An honourable death. Clandestinely He against Rome conspires, and cherishes Abominable schemes. He calls us tyrants; But in his breast he nourishes the thought Of a far fiercer tyranny than ours. He would destroy the senate: afterwards Enslave the people; yet he talks of freedom. More deadly in proportion is his poison, As 'tis conceal'd beneath a specious semblance. Here doth he raise the signal of a rebel, And there he breathes the whispers of a traitor. I to his violence, violence will oppose, And thwart his treasons by preventive arts. All is foreseen already. Thou know'st not His dark contrivances; to his designs Now, as an instrument, he goads thee on, Now, as a veil, to cloak his purposes; Beneath thy character he screens himself, But never will he share with thee his plunder. That thou dost love, e'en as thou lov'st thy daughter, Thy country, he well knows; hence he affects To be the avenger of thy daughter's cause; But with his comrades afterwards he laughs At thy credulity. From thee he hides it; To them he scruples not to shew himself In his true shape, th'oppressor of his country. Virginius. Daughters are torn from their afflicted mothers; From fathers torn, who in their country's service The prime of life have spent; the magistrates Appal us more than e'en our enemies; Then how can Rome another tyrant dread? Ap. Icilius, I know it, with a tale Of idle love dares to asperse my name. What are his proofs? His boundless insolence, The cries of the besotted multitude, And my unwary clemency, are proofs. This Marcus is my client; he demands Thy daughter, I must then that daughter love, And be her ravisher. Choice arguments! Virginius. This doth Icilius alone affirm? Others attest the same. Ap. Perhaps thy daughter, Suborn'd by him ... Virginius. There are too many proofs, Whose utterance shame, not less than rage, forbids; Nor is it a light proof that thou dost strive To clear thyself to me. Ap. Thou art resolv'd With the conspirators t'unite thyself? Virginius. I am resolv'd to die, or keep my daughter. Ap. I love thee, and I therefore wish thee safe. Virginius. And wherefore lovest me? Ap. Rome may require Thy arm in her defence: ah leave, I pray thee, Icilius to his fate; leave him to perish: He alone merits it. We prize thy life. Virginius. I understand thee; thou dost deem me fit For servitude ... Ap. No: Equal I esteem thee, If not superior, to any Roman; And, as a proof of this, scarce shall thy feet Have reach'd the camp, ere thou shall be promoted To the supreme command. Virginius. And dost thou dare To bribe me to compliance? Shall I owe That meed to Appius' favour, which alone Is due to valour? To acquire that favour, What crime have I committed? From the camp, Alas! e'en from the camp is honour fled; This Rome, and, what is worse, Rome's foes know well; Those, who, a boast, not heretofore enjoyed, May now exult in, on the back to have pierced More than one son of Rome. 'Tis true, the wounds, The honour'd wounds, which on my breast I shew thee, Such as the Roman mothers bless'd ere while When they beheld them on their sons, are now Received unluckily, and will assume A less imposing aspect, since we fight Beneath thy banners. I have pledg'd myself To Rome, by an inviolable oath, That, if I ever to the camp return, Rome shall be born again. Thy words to me Are fraught with craft; my heart is on my lips. A soldier, father, citizen, am I: Of evils foreign to myself I speak not; While Rome endures them, I endure them also.â But my Virginia ... Ap. 'Twas not I that first Incited Marcus to contest his claim, Though thus by lying fame I am aspers'd; Yet, perhaps, I can dissuade him from the project. For thee I feel compassion: and perchance, Without commotion, or the chance of blood, I might restore thy daughter to thy arms, If thou felt'st for her as a father should. But thou dost thirst for blood; dost wish to see Thy daughter wedded to Icilius, And wouldst involve that daughter, with thyself, In the destruction of a miscreant traitor. Virginius. To me canst thou restore her? Ap. If thou wilt Refuse her to Icilius. Virginius. She is his By a sworn compact. Ap. He'll release thee from it; To day ... by death ... Go, go, there now remains But a few moments for mature reflection. Thy child is thine, if not to Icilius given: But if she be his wife, no power of mine Can hinder her from perishing with him. Virginius. Unhappy sire! ... To what am I reduced? ... SCENE THE THIRD. Appius. Ap. He is too much a Roman. Appius Himself might fear, if Rome within her walls Had many such as he. But two, no more, Two are the Romans worthy of my hatred: And one is aged, and he is a father; Strong fetters these: his own rash insolence Shall be the engine of the other's ruin. To make him victim of his headstrong passion Shall be my project ... But who do I see? Behold Virginia and her mother come Amid the people's tears. I now must try Or to intimidate, or to seduce them. SCENE THE FOURTH. Appius, Numitoria, Virginia. Ap. While time remains to you, and it is short, Withdraw a little from that boisterous train, Which rather may endanger than protect you. You see me not at present as a judge: Approach, Virginia; hear me; thou wilt see me Wearing ere long a different aspect here. Virginia. Hast thou, oh Appius, spoken with my father? Nu. Hast thou repented? Hast thou, taught by fear, Learned to be more discreet? Ap. By fear, say'st thou? ... No, but by pity. Hear me; and my words Will prove my heart is not impress'd by fear. Virginia, I love thee; with my lips I ratify my fondness: violence There can be none, to snatch thee from my power; But many reasons why thou shouldst submit. Virginia. Is this thy change? ah, mother, let us go. Ap. Remain, and hear me. Art thou then, Virginia, For thy Icilius so infatuated? In him, if enterprising ardour please thee, Am I perchance less passionate than he? Does his rank charm thee? Though he be once more A tribune, could he thus with me compare? If his free heart and independent feelings? Does not my breast a nobler heart contain, More independent feelings? I, who mean To make himself, and all his partisans, Submit to my authority; while they Obey my nod ... Nu. And dost thou thus presume To unveil thy purposes? ... Ap. I am advanced So far; so little now remains to do, That I dare manifest them openly. How great I am, your thought cannot conceive: The tongue of Marcus, as the sword of thousands, Is under my controul. If thou refuse To be Icilius' spouse, I instantly The process set aside. Virginia. Abandon him? ... Ah, rather ... Nu. Oh, audacious turpitude! Oh, miscreant! ... Ap. Dost thou think that his regard Can bear comparison with mine? His tales Of liberty, his tribunitial office, Conspiracies and tumults, are his passion. Long was he silent; now he deems thyself A means once more of reinstalling him: His turbulent ambition makes him speak, And not his love for thee. But grant, that I Should also, in this undertaking, brave Imminent danger; thence thou mayest infer Th'immeasurable ardour of my love: Power, life, and fame, for thee I have endanger'd. All am I ready, for thy dear love's sake, To sacrifice; Icilius from that love Hopes all to gain. Virginia. No more.âIcilius vile, By this comparison of thyself with him, Nor thyself noble, canst thou ever make. Short is the parellel: within himself He has the all, of which thou hast no part: Nothing of him can ever be in thee: As much as I hate thee, I love Icilius. Why dost thou speak of love? Dar'st thou bestow A name so sacred on thy impious lust? Not that I e'er would be so, but in thought It never yet hath entered in thy heart To seek me as a spouse? ... Ap. The time perchance ... Virginia. Think not that I shall ever ... Nu. Thou didst mean To mock us: oh indignity! ... Virginia. Thou miscreant, To no condition canst thou make me listen. Ap. 'Tis well: thou shalt at last fall in my power, All sprinkled with the life-blood of thy lover. Virginia. Oh Heaven! ... Ap. Yes, sprinkled with thy lover's blood, And with thy sire's. Nu. Oh impious! Virginia. My father! Ap. All. At my nod falls whomsoe'er I will: The fate of Siccius proclaim'd this truth. One hour is wanting now, or ere I give A signal for the massacre. Virginia. Icilius! ... One hour! one hour alone! Oh, Appius, pity! My lover ... and my father ... Nu. Two such heroes Expiring at thy nod? And dost thou think That thence thy power will be impregnable? Ap. And should the whole with me be overturn'd, Would such an universal crash restore Virginius and Icilius? Virginia. Appius, Thou mak'st me tremble ... Nu. ... Ah! ... do listen to me. What, if I supplicate? Ap. With but one word She saves the lives of both. Virginia. ... Appius ... suspend For this one day the blow ... I do conjure thee. Meanwhile I'll banish every thought of marriage ... Severed from me, ah let Icilius live; I will endeavour from my heart to tear His image ... and from him I will withdraw My hopes, all placed in him so many years; Perchance ... meanwhile ... the power of time ... alas! What can I more? Ah! let Icilius live: Before thy feet I prostrate fall. But I, Alas! what do I do? ... what do I say? Time will still make me hate thee more and more, And more Icilius love. I will fear nothing; We are Romans: and my lover and my father Would never keep a life that was the fruit Of their dishonour: if they once are slain, Nothing remains for me to lose. In time Wilt thou not give to me a sword, oh mother? Nu. Come ... come ... oh daughter ... gods there are in Heaven, The avengers of oppressed innocence; Come: let us trust in them ... Virginia. Ah, do thou be The prop of my weak frame ... my footsteps faulter ... SCENE THE FIFTH. Appius. Ap. And am I baffled yet? To Appius Fresh obstacles are only fresh incentives: Plebeian beauty, who hadst scarcely warm'd, Unaided by events, this heart of mine, With a slight, transient flame, now that for thee Rome shudders with disdain, immoveably, Profoundly in my bosom thou art fixed; Now much as is the very power I grasp at, Nay more, art thou essential to my peace. But the sixth hour approaches. Let us see If all is ready to convince the people, That in themselves no longer, but in me, Is centred all the majesty of Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Virginius, Icilius, with Followers. Virginius. The fatal hour arrives. Icilius, see, On every side the forum teems with arms. And all around ... Ici. Close by my side I see A train, though less, of loftier hardihood. Virginius. Dost thou confide in them? Ici. I in myself Confide. Virginius. In me, as much as in thyself, Thou ought'st to trust. Before the time I come A little space; for I was well assured That I should find thee here. But, in few words, Permit me, while there is a time for speech, To question thee concerning thy designs. Should we unloose the decemviral fetters, How am I to accost thee? By what name, So long as thou art within the walls of Rome? Ici. A Roman, citizen, and free; the peer Of every Roman; only than the laws Less great; greater alone than any king. But thou suggestest a tremendous doubt To me, a Roman, Roman as thou art; But thou dost not offend me: in thy breast The vile suspicion never had arisen, No never, had not Appius inspired it. Virginius. Infamous times! The powerful condescend, E'en as the powerless, to practise fraud. I did not think it ... but so well did Appius Colour his phrases ... what avails it now? If yet I trusted him, one look of thine Fills me with more of settled confidence Than all the oaths of Appius. Ah, the miscreant, I swear it is as possible that I Should e'er to thee be faithless and thy cause, As it is possible that thou shouldst be By thine own heart, by thine own sword betray'd. Ici. I do trust to thee; and to thee alone, No, not in these: though they an hour ago Fiercely to me, and Rome, did pledge their faith. Fear, calumny, and gold, may take them from me: The arms of Appius all; unknown to heroes, But yet too efficacious. Now, let come What may come, if the tyrant persevere In his iniquitous designs, he dies. That he is apprehensive, he has shewn By his attempt to practise on thy faith: In the corruption of the affrighted people Does he confide: too sure a cause for trust. If Appius die, nine tyrants yet remain, Less powerful indeed, and all dispersed; Yet in whose power are placed the nerve of Rome, Both of our armies. Freedom thus appears, Which perhaps few wish, and thou alone deservest, But too too doubtful: vengeance thus alone Seems to me certain. I see all its danger: And for this reason wish the more to brave it. Virginius. Oh great of heart! In thee this day will Rome See herself die, or rise again in thee. Yield only to my unimpair'd old age Th'honour of giving signal for the combat. Be it mine to indicate the when and how We are to draw our swords. Fix on my eye Thy steady eye, and on thy sword thy hand; Meanwhile the aspect of the assembled people We will observe; 'twill be, perchance, expedient, To make the blow more sure, to affect at first Conciliatory manners: I beseech thee, Let all thy movements be controul'd by mine. Ici. Thou art a Roman and a father. Give The signal for attack; and thou shalt see My strokes more rapid than the lightning's flash. Virginius. Go; thou shouldst lead the helpless ladies hither: Mingle thy followers with the common people; It would be best that Appius, when he comes, Should find me here alone. I will address To him ambiguous words: meanwhile, the place Most opportune, whence we may fall on Appius, I will espy. I here await thy coming: When thou returnest, do not wear a look Imprudently audacious: check thy fury For a short time; the hour approaches fast, When, on this spot, it all may spend itself. SCENE THE SECOND. Virginius. Virginius. Oh Rome! ... oh daughter! now I fear from nothing, Save from Icilius' too intemperate valour. SCENE THE THIRD. Appius, Virginius. Ap. Hast thou at last resolved? Virginius. A long time since. Ap. As should a father? Virginius. As a Roman father. Ap. Thou with Icilius every tie hast broken? Virginius. Three powerful ties bind me to him. Ap. They are? Virginius. The ties of blood, of friendship, and of virtue. Ap. Perfidious as thou art! these boasted ties Blood shall perpetuate. Virginius. I am most willing That they with blood should be perpetuated. I know that 'tis in vain for me to oppose thee, Yet I prepare myself to suffer death Sooner than loose my daughter from my grasp; I cannot more than this: the gods, I hope, Will one day signally avenge my cause. Ap. Seest thou the gods of Appius? The arm'd troops With which I am surrounded. Well I know, That by avowed and by clandestine means Ye do prepare to cope with me by arms: On my side are the laws; licence on yours: I should reap glory even from defeat; To you success would only bring disgrace. Already the ferocious multitude, In ânumbers without number,â crowd the forum: Trust to that multitude: whate'er it wills, It always has the power to execute. Behold Virginia weeping; in her train Her shrieking mother comes with hair dishevell'd, And her clothes rent. What clamorous turbulence? With what a howling do the heavens resound! Who knows what number of arm'd partizans Icilius hath inveigled to the forum! SCENE THE FOURTH. Numitoria, Virginia, Appius, Virginius, Marcus, People, Lictors. Nu. Oh treachery! People. Oh unauspicious day! Virginia. At least thou yet art living, oh my father! Alas, thou know'st not all ... Icilius! Virginius. What is become of him? I see him not. Nu. Dead is Icilius. Virginius. What do I hear? Oh heavens! Ap. Who was so bold, as thus to wreak Vengeance upon him in defence of Rome; Without awaiting that he were condemn'd By the just rigour of the laws? Nu. Ah wretch! And dar'st thou thus dissemble? To the forum With us he came, depending on his valour; When, lo! his own adherents came to him With menacing deportment, face to face, Aruns, and Faustus, and Cesonius, And others with them arm'd: first Aruns cried, âThou art a traitor, then?â ... Hence, in an instant, Inflamed with passion, and with frantic howlings, They drew their swords, and leapt together on him. Icilius, always ready for defence, E'en ere a word he utter'd, in a circle Brandished his flaming sword. Aruns fell first; All who had courage to attack him fell. Then to the astonished multitude from far The most intimidated cried: âAh Romans, âIcilius is a traitor: he would be âIn Rome a king.â Scarce had that name been heard, Ere all around on every side assault him, And instantaneous was his death. Virginius. Alas! What an unworthy death for such a hero! Nu. The swords of others ne'er avail'd to smite him; He turned his own against himself, and cried, âI will not be a king; nor be a slave. âMy spouse, learn to die free from my example.â Virginia. Alas! I heard thy dying words distinctly ... Beloved husband; I will follow thee ... Three times I saw the sword within thy breast Plunged by thy own right-hand; towards that sword I stretched my firm hand, but in vain ... Nu. The crowd Has driven us onward from the horrible sight, And here impell'd us. Virginius. Now Icilius falls, Appius is king in Rome. Ap. Oh, Romans, hear ... Icilius, and his faithless partizans, Alone were instrumental to his fate. Conscious of his misdeeds, he would by death Somewhat atone for his approbrious life. He died a Roman; though he lived not one. I ne'er myself should have chastised the traitor; He was too dear to you: but time at last Brings every thing to light, and has removed The fatal bandage from the people's eyes. The multitude had called it tyranny If I had sentenced him to punishment; And yet so worthy did he seem of death, E'en to his own adherents. Virginius. Appius, No man dost thou deceive: all here behold The author of this horrible treachery. Icilius slain, thou more than half hast gain'd Thy impious cause. Now with impunity Appius proceed, and let us hear the sentence. But what do I demand? Who reads it not In every face of this arm'd multitude? And in the silence of affrighted Rome? Ap. What now, ye traitors? Since ye have in vain Wished for rebellion, if ye are betrayed By your own creatures, why do ye blame me? Where is the wonder, if to one so faithless They were themselves unfaithful? Sons of Rome, I now address myself to you alone. Ye see around you armed troops dispersed 'Tis true, but solely for the good of Rome. To your unanimous and upright wishes Who dares oppose himself? Assuredly Not I: but I have thus willed it to be, That I might so defend against a few, A factious few, the majesty of Rome, Centred in me by universal suffrage. Perhaps in Icilius the last traitor died? Lictors, surround Virginius with your axes Till sentence be pronounced. To evil deeds He comes with evil thoughts: if he hath reasons To urge in his defence, let him produce them; But thwart him if he seeks redress by force. Nu. Alas! Virginia. Ah wretched me! My father also? Virginius. 'Tis true I am a traitor, for I am Virginia's father; as Icilius was, Being her husband; all are traitors, all That do refuse to prostitute their wives And daughters to his lust. Are ye not yet Fully convinced of his atrocity? Romans, although ye see me innocent, Yet with Icilius, and with thousand others, Let me be dragg'd to death: but ah, defend That virtuous virgin; to a lot she's destined Worse, worse, a thousand times than any death. Not for myself do I thus supplicate; For her I tremble; and for her I weep. Nu. And do not all of you with us shed tears? Oh fathers, learn, from our example learn, What ye have to expect ... all, all are silent? Hard-hearted ... cruel ... Mothers, hear me then: Oh ye alone who truly love the offspring Sprung from your blood, and nourished in your womb; Here to have children is too great a crime. Mothers, if you their honour, or your own, Regard, oh plunge, soon as they see the light, The fatal weapon in their innocent breasts. Ap. Listen, ye mothers, to a mother's love? Who sees not now that she is not the mother? And that her husband is by her deceived? Of me ye asked the presence of Virginius, And 'twas most just, that he should witness be Of such a trial: see him, here he is: But can his presence interdict that I Boldly pronounce an equitable sentence? The witnesses of Marcus I've examined, And lastly Marcus; they agree. His right, I swear it to the people, is established: The specious imposition of the mother Is more than proved by evidence like this; Whence by a subtle counterchange she seeks To gain by tumults, a cause lost by truth. I grieve to be obliged to undeceive The still deluded sireâand yet I ought. Marcus, Virginia's thine; to thine own slave Thy just pretension I cannot refuse. Nu. Was e'er such sentence given? Will no one hear me? Virginia. Mother, thou seest my father, how, alas! With axes he's encompassed: he cannot Exert himself for me; scarce can he speak; And speaks in vain. Give me the sword; thou hast it; By thee 'twas promised to me: I have lost Icilius; shall I lose my honour also? Virginius. Oh impious herd of despicable slaves! Are ye by fear thus palsied? Ye forget, So that ye may prolong a wretched life, Your honour, and your children, and your country. I hear a scarce distinguishable murmur; But no one moves. Ah vile, ah doubly vile! May each of you have such a lot as mine; If possible a worse: of property, Of honour, children, wives, and liberty, Of arms, and lastly robb'd of intellect, Ah may the tyrant, amid lengthen'd torments, Take from you, what is scarcely now your own, Your infamous and prostituted lives, Which ye would purchase at so vile a price. Ap. 'Tis true, Rome murmurs, but at thee alone. Be silent now. This instant to her master, Lictors, conduct the slave; and be not baffled By the seditious grief of the feign'd mother: Tear from her arms her surreptitious daughter. Nu. Ye first shall slay me. Virginia. Mother! People. Luckless day! Virginius. Appius, delay, and hear me for a moment: Delay, and hear me, I beseech thee. I Brought up this virgin as my only child; More than myself I hitherto have loved her: If my wife utters falsehoods, to the fraud I am not accessary. Nu. What do I hear? Canst thou consent thus to degrade thy wife? Is thus Virginius changed? Virginia. Canst thou decide At such a moment to desert me thus? Dost thou account me then no longer thine? Virginius. Whate'er I may account thee, I do love thee, As should the tenderest father love his daughter. Ah, Appius, suffer thou, that, yet once more, Ere I for ever lose her, I may clasp Her that I always as a child have loved. My pride is humbled, it is broken, nothing: In thee do I adore the majesty, The institutions, and the gods of Rome. But can I in a day, nay, in an instant, Of that paternal love divest myself, Which for so many happy years has been The best part of my life? Ap. May Heaven forbid That I should e'er to such a pitch be cruel, As to ascribe to guilt a love so just. Once more thyself, thou speakest as thou oughtest, And as I ought I answer thee. For him, Lictors, at once make way. Virginius. Ah come, oh daughter, To my paternal breast. With such a name, 'Tis sweet to me yet once more to accost thee ... Once more.âThe last pledge of paternal love; I give theeâdeath and freedom. Virginia. Oh ... true ... father. Nu. Oh Heaven! my daughter ... Ap. Miscreant, what hast thou done? Lictors, ah! quickly ... Virginius. To the infernal gods Do I devote thy head with this pure blood. People. Oh sight atrocious! Appius is a tyrant. Virginius. Romans, are ye now stirr'd to rage? 'tis late: 'Twill not restore life to the innocent. People. The tyrant Appius dies. Ap. The parricide And his adherents die. Virginius. Before we die, Heroes, there yet is time for vengeance. Virginius and the people are about to assault the lictors and the satellites of Appius. Ap. Time Appius and his followers advance to repel the people and Virginius. To punish thee before I die remains. Virginius. The tyrant Appius dies. The curtain falls. People. The tyrant dies. A great tumult, and the clang of arms, are heard.</field>
