      <field name="fulltext">In the original it is Madrigal and Trolleta. As sound may be reckon'd among the primary beauties of the Italian drama, I am almost persuaded our author fix'd on Trolletta, to render the name of his heroine more musical and harmonious. A British author should prefer sense to sound; wherefore I have, by the alteration of a single letter, made it Trulletta; the force, the significancy, and the propriety of which name, will be obvious to the most illiterate English reader. I wish, for the honour of my country, the preference of sound to sense were confin'd to Italy only. We have melancholy instances in some of our modern tragedies, that such infection hath reach'd even the British climate.MADRIGAL AND TRULLETTA. A MOCK-TRAGEDY.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Ye awful censors of the tragic scene, Who come, from principle of fun or spleen, To rob the bard of fame and profit too, (Rob him of that, which not enriches you, Othello. And make him poor indeed) for this one night Forgo the pleasantry of damning spite. Prologue to Cato.Our author shuns, in scenes of sound and show, To move by buckram springs of royal woe; Where struts, and starts, and twists, and lungs supply The want of nature, sense, and energy. He casts his drama in life's humbler sphere; That the small vulgar, with the great, may share The mournful pen'orths of his tragic ware. No hackney'd tale or plan, our bard would chuse For the sad subject of his melting muse: Hoping from novelty to draw renown (For novelty's the darling of the town) His many moving incidents are ta'en, From whence? The book and volume of his brain. Hamlet. Our bardâ(he hopes without offence) presumes To deck his mimic play with borrow'd plumes. Whene'er the nature of his subject brought A known similitude of tragic thought, He snatch'd the sentiment already penn'd, Afraid to alter what he could not mend. Then to his motley scenes give patient ear, Each line with caution scan, with candour hear; Your kind compassion with your judgment blend, Prologue to the Drummer.Least, in attacking him, you wound a friend.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Garret. Buckramo, Strapada (embracing.) Buckramo. In the first six lines of this tragedy, our author seems to have had his eye on the beginning of the 3d act of Cato, viz. Thanks to my stars, I have not rang'd about The wilds of life, e'er I could find a friend Nature first pointed out my Portius to me, And early taught me, by her secret force, To love thy person, e'er I knew thy merit; Till what was instinct grew up into friendship. Which lines, tho' extremely beautiful, are far short of the sublimity of our author. Instead of thanking his stars, which is the hackney'd phrase of every mechanic, and nature pointing out, he puts into Bubkramo's mouth, Thanks to all-bounteous fate, whose index hand Hath pointed out, &amp;c. which undoubtedly is more pompous and sublime. Not to mention any thing of white moments, informing instinct plucking a soul by the sleeve, and other beauties in this passage; it will be sufficiently apparent to a reader of even ordinary sagacity, how much our author has improved on Mr. Addison. Dr. Humbug. Thanks to all-bounteous fate, whose index hand Hath pointed out Strapada for my friend! The moments sure were white and lucky all, A better order of succeeding days Comes smiling forward, white and lucky all. Fair Penitent. When by the sleeve informing instinct pluck'd Buckramo's foul, and cried, âBuckramo, list! âBuckramo, take Strapada to thy heartâ Happy Buckramo! Thrice more happy far The beauty, elegance, and the propriety of this, and the following simile, are scarce to be equalled in any language. Dr. Humbug.Than whisker'd Turk, who on Elysian plains Satiates his fancy with immortal nymphs; Or half-starv'd 'prentice; whose supplying purse Can gratify, when tiresome shop is shut, A punning critick of my acquaintance, to whom I lately shew'd this tragedy, made the following remark; Tripe is partly deriv'd from guts; wherefore your Italian friend hath given the world a proof he had some guts in his brains, when he hit upon this simile.With tripe, or sausages, his craving mawâ A figure of such universal use among tragic writers, that if I were to give all the examples, which have occur'd to me in the perusal of English tragedy, they would make as large a folio, as any of the ancient fathers. Dr. Humbug.But oh, Strapada! oh! my friend, amid This flow of joy, Buckramo's soul is pierc'd, As with a paring knife, or bodkin sharp. Strap. O ye immortal powers! that guard the just, O ye immortal powers that guard the just, Watch round his couch, and soften his repose! Cato. And govern all contingences below; With careful watch beset Buckramo's soul, And keep, for ever keep it free from woe! What is it that torments Strapada's friend? Two games well known to gamblersâThe reader may observe, in this definition, that I have imitated the manner of the ingenious N. Bailey, Philologos. A specimen of this judicious author's abilities may be seen in his explication of the word thunder, which he defines, âA noise known by persons not deaf.âHath Put, or Cribbige, with insatiate sweep, Of all thy coin despoil'd thee, left thee bare And pennyless? or salamander nymph, Inhabitant of Drury, from thy fob, With faithless palm, decoy'd thy gutless watch? Or infidel retailer of Intire I cannot, in this place, forbear taking notice of the negligence of our dictionary-mongers, in omitting the explanation of the word INTIRE; or, as it is frequently written, ENTIRE, in the sense I have now used it. I am persuaded they cannot plead the obsoleteness of the word, since there are so many signal instances of the use and propriety of it, in and about this metropolis. For want of such previous explanation, I am not ashamed to own, that I was led into a very great error in regard to the true meaning of the word, when I first came to London. On seeing Parsons Intire at the bottom of a sign, I took it for a laconic advertisement; That intire or finish'd clergymen might be hired, or heard of at that placeâThis mistake of mine I have thought proper to mention, that the future publishers of dictionaries may not slip over the explanation of a word of such consequence. Denied a morning draught of purl on tick? Say why is this? speak, speak, I charge thee speak. Speak, speak, I charge thee speak. Hamlet. If our author had not visibly borrow'd this expression, I should scarce have imagin'd the preceding part of the speech was intended as an imitation of Horatio's beautiful address to the ghost. Buck. Yes I will speak; will to Strapada tell The latent secrets of my inmost soulâ Know thenâbut by the sacred ties of friendship; A solemn conjuration to secrecy, and of equal importance to the secret about to be revealedâthere are so many resemblances of this speech in our dramatic writers, that I hardly know from which of them our Italian hath borrow'd. By all the spangled train of glitt'ring stars; By my grim father's shade, who pendent died That no future critick may plume himself with the discovery of a blunder, I have thought proper to inform my readers, it was not the father's shade, but the father himself, who pendent died On gallow tree. On gallow tree, I charge thee keep it lock'd From mortal cognisance, from human ear, An alienâyes, Strapadaâwouldst thou think it? I amâyes, by the Gods, I am in love. Strap. Ye heavenly powers, in love! astonishment On my corporeal faculties hath made Sudden arrestâunsay it, and I'm happyâ Thy head, with melancholly shake, confirms The doleful truthâah! what a falling off Oh! Hamlet, what a falling off was there! Hamlet. Is hereâin love! O lost, undone Buckramo! But say; what witching nymph with magic glance Hath stung Buckramo's soul? Buck. What if it were Trullettaâwouldst thou disapprove the choice? Strap. A very imperial, but foolish oath, reply'd the punning critick.By Jove's imperial bird, not I, not I. The simplicity, beauty, and propriety of this thought cannot be sufficiently admired. Some criticks may possibly disbelieve the story of the wand'ring Jew; but that does not at all affect our author in the choice of this image, since fiction, as well as fact, is allowable in poetry. Our Bard liv'd in a country where tradition had greater weight, than in this infidel island. But that our author may not be suppos'd to have taken this image from tradition only, I can assure the world I have seen several editions of the history of this remarkable traveller, and could produce a hundred gentlemen of veracity to attest the like; and as none of our criticks have yet shewn the falsity of such history, it is to me a sufficient proof that there was, is, and must be such a person as the wand'ring Jew. A certain modern author hath intimated the image is too low for the dignity of tragedy, and advised the following alteration, viz. For sure the sun, in his diurnal round, Nor moon, nor stars, e'er saw a form so fairâ but I would ask the judicious reader, whether, according to our present knowledge of the heavenly bodies, it would not be downright nonsense to talk of the sun, moon, or stars seeing a form so fair. Several dramatic authors make no scruple of affirming these bodies are capable of vision, and among the rest the ingenious Mr. Rowe; who says, ? if only The midnight moon, and silent stars had seen it. Fair Penitent. but unless Mr. Rowe means the man in the moon, or the supposed inhabitants of the starry orbs seeing it, he must mean nothing at all. Dr. Humbug.For should the Wandring Jew, with restless search, Rumage this ball of earth from east to west, From south to north, thro' all its different climes, He could not find a fairer, lovelier she. Our author seems to have drawn this beautiful image from the French-English song of Sweet a prittee Bettee, den de moon brighter, Or scow'r pewder, or silver spoon.No splendent pewter from the scourer's hand Comes half so brightâshea's beauty might ensnare ? shea's beauty might ensnare A conqueror's soul, and made him leave his crown At random, to be scuffled for by slaves. Caius Marius. A miser's soul, and make him leave his bags At random, to be scuffled for by th' Mob. So radiant is her form, so more than mortal, That if perfection were with her compar'd, This may be stiled, in Mr. Bayes's phrase, the poetical non ultra. Dr. Humbug.'Twould seem imperfect. Buck. Hold thy lavish tongue, Or jealousy will mad my raging soul. Strap. Far as futurity's untravel'd waste This and the following line from Irene, a tragedy of the sublimest diction in the English language. Dr. Humbug. Lies open to conjecture's dubious ken, It seems to me thou wilt not, canst not win The peerless virgin, but by blood and broil: For Madrigal, a Grub-street sonetteer, Her senses fascinates with magic rhyme. The bard incessant tunes the sapphic lyre, And paints her in his song of mien divine. Well-pleas'd she hearkens to the praiseful strain, As venal statesmen to the chink of gold; And deems herself the goddess he pourtrays. Buck. Too well, alas! alas! too well I know Her fond affection for the starvling bardâ Bard did I say? a ballad-monger rather! A wilful murderer of sense in rhymeâ Now, by the powers! his ditties scarce outvie The pasted ornaments of cobler's stalls!â Do we not know that Garrick hath refus'd David Garrick, Esq; an actor, and manager of the theatre in Drury Lane, in the 18th century. This great man, though not above five feet six inches in stature, was the most celebrated, and universal performer, that ever trod the British, or any other stage in the known world. In all his theatrical personations he was so exact a copyer of nature, that it was a proverb in his day, with the best judges of the stage, Nature and Garrick are the same. This note, my readers are desired to remember, is made for the benefit of the lovers of drama, in the year two thousand and upwards. It would be an affront to the above gentleman's merit and universality, to add a note, to inform the world who, and what he is; or even to suppose that his memory would not outlive his theatrical performances, at least, a brace of centuries. The horrid fustian he so vainly stiles A tragedy, at which the caitiff swears That Garrick is a dolt, a goose, a fool? Strap. True, my brave friend: would she, like Garrick too, Refuse his suitâ Buck. She must; she shall, Strapada. By hell! in spite of all her wayward pride, I'll have her stillâspite of her self, I'll have her: This may, at first sight, appear a kind of Tipperarian rhodomontade; but, according to the method of bringing about many modern marriages, I believe my readers will soon be convinc'd, that several young ladies have been drawn into the nuptial state in spite of their own inclinations: which is all our author means. Dr. Humbug. Tho' fate, and all the world should join t'oppose me: Or, by the gods, I'll lay a scene of blood, Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature!

Strapada, blood!âby th' powers of hell, ? By the powers of hell I will be drunk with vengeance. Regicide. A liquor I never yet heard of. Dr. Humbug.I will be drunk with vengeance! princely drunk With blood's rich nectarâI will murder all, That suck-in vital air beneath her roof! Nay not a louse shall 'scape to tell the tydings. Strap. How! not a louse escape! a single louse! On what extremes extreme distress impells me. Brothers. An extreme pretty line! Dr. Humbug.To what extremes extreme revenge impells thee? What! turn a murderer ten thousand fold, To glut thy vengeance on the marbled maid! Thy inclination to shed blood rides post. Fatal Secret. If Mr. Theobald, at the time of writing this celebrated line, were not riding post on Pegasus, we may fairly conclude, there is no such beast as a poetical post-horse. Dr. Humbug.Thy inclination to shed blood rides post. Art thou so lost to virtue, to revenge Thy slighted vows on a poor peaceful tribe; A harmless people, that have wittingly Ne'er done thee wrong?âNow, by my awl I swear, Such cruelty ensanguin'd speaks a mind Of temp'rament infernalâfare thee well! I'll never hold communion with thee more: But from the day-book of my dearest friendship I'll cross thee outâI love thee yet, Buckramo, ? Cassio, I love thee, But never more be officer of mine. Othello. But, never more be intimate of mine. Buck. What means Strapada? Strap. Like the faithless boy, A simile as simple, natural, and beautiful, as ever appear'd in the English language. Dr. Humbug. Who hath by secret felony despoil'd The feather'd parents of their unfledg'd brood, To which his partner had an equal claim, Thus, thus, I ring thee off. (joining his little finger to Buckramo's. Buck. O stay! my friend, A very common tragical expressionânay, I have known many dramatick heroes uttering such complaints, when they have been absolutely mad from their first speech in the play. An instance of this dramatic madness, may be found in a tragedy, which was publish'd by subscription in the present century. Dr. Humbug.Or thou wilt run me into madnessânay, By all the shades of my great ancestry; By all thy virtuous friendship to Scourella, The dame, who give me birth, my more than mother, Oh, my Sciolto! oh, my more than father! Fair Penitent. Which phrase may probably mean grand father, or great grand father. Humbug. Thou shalt not leave me thus! Strap. Let go my arm; My friend, Mr. Rone, hath translated it soul; but I am of opinion it ought to be soal, as there is an antithesis of awl and end in the sequel of the line.Or, on my soal, this awl shall be thy end. Buck. But, hear me, noble youthâ Strap. The solemn vow Hath reach'd the skies, and is recorded there In characters indelibleâforgo Thy hold! nor vainly hope to shake my purpose. Buck. But think upon our friendshipâ Strap. Damn our friendship! What fellowship can virtue have with murder? Still dost thou hold me!âthink on what I've sworn; Nor dare provoke th'impending blowâunhand me! Or, by the gods!ânay, if thou'rt obstinate, Take this, and this. (wounds him with his awl.

Scourella sings. Air 1. Accompanied by the Jews harp. This, and the following air, were extracted from that inimitable musical dialogue, between Messieurs Flute and Trumpet in the same tragedy. Flute. Stay, stay, despairâbe gone, vain hoper, go; Sorrow can hear no voice, but that of woe. Trumpet. Away with your tears where enjoyment should flow. Did defiance to painâlet her go, let her go. Do the gods love complainers? No, no, no. Flute. Ah! 'tis in vain to strive!âfarewel, believing; Death is the sure short roadâto shun deceiving. Rest and the grave will meetâbut ah!âtill then Joy flies, the vain pursuit of hopeless men. As our author hath borrowed so largely from the above tragedy, I would refer the reader to the opening of that play; which, if he apply to the bookselller for, let me advise him in the cautionary phrase of our modern advertisers, to be careful to ask for Hill's Merope.Vain hoper, begoneâstay, despair: Despair, stayâvain hoper, go, go. For sorrow no accents should hear, But those of lamenting and woe. Believing, farewelâthe sure road Is death all deceiving to shun; Till plac'd in our clay-cold abode, Joy flies man's pursuit like a nun. Air 2. Accompanied by the Strum. Away with your tears, where enjoyment should flow; Bid defiance to painâlet her go, let her go: Do the gods love complainers? No, no. Away with your tears, from your eyes, have them bang'd: Bid defiance to pain, let her go and be hang'd; Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go, Let her go, and be hang'd, let her go, let her go: Do the gods love complainers? No, no. Scul. Awayâshe risesâangels, that have tun'd, Reward the vocal magic of thy pipe. SCENE IV. Trulletta, Sculliona. Trul.

We've march'd without impedimentâO night! This invocation to night is certainly one of the sublimest pieces that ever was written. Dr. Humbug. Alternate regent of the lapsing hours, Sister of chaos, e'er the upstart sun And world had being, thou, with sable sway, Didst rule the uncreated mass of things. Didst rule the uncreated mass of things. Paradise Lost. What golden 'vantage from thine eyeless reign To mortals flow! beneath thy friendly veil The meagre bard oft 'scapes the prying ken Of lurking catchpole, and eludes the touch This image seems to be borrow'd from that ingenious poem, the Splendid Shilling. Unhallow'd. City prigs, of sober seeming, Quaff their nocturnal beverige, and reel Unnotic'd home. The painted courtezan, Who with her quartern, and the liquid food Of Indian shrub, repels the keen attacks Of raging hunger, all the live long day, Now in full blazon, with alluring leer, Patroles the slippery streetsâtheâbut that lovely vision [Trulletta appears at the window. Forbids all further simileâshe beckonsâ He comes, Trulletta: most refulgent maid, Thy Madrigalâwith hasty strides he comesâ The comparison of ladies' eyes with the sun is very frequent in tragedy. Among numberless passages of this kind, that of Rowe is not the least poetical, viz. Those eyes, which could his own fair beams decay, Might shine for him, and bless the world with day. Amb. Step. but the thought of our heroine's eyes eclipsing the sun, is certainly a more striking, and sublime allusion, than ever was yet met with on the subject of eyes. Dr. Humbug.Now, would the sun, in his meridian glare, Suffer eclipse from her more radiant eyes. SCENE II. Madrigal, Sculliona. Scul. O! Mr. Madrigal, I'm glad you're come. To all judges of nature, how beautiful must the unaffected simplicity of this line appear! some of our modern wholesale dealers in fustian, would have express'd this image in the following words, O bard sublime! thy coming glads my soul. but how far the simplicity of our image excels the force of such rant, I leave the learned to determine. Dr. Humbug. Mad. Thanks, gentle Scullionaâfor this kindness, And all thy other curtesies, e'er long I will fulfil my promiseâthy bright charms Shall be the subject of my tuneful song. For thee I'll strain each faculty of thought, Here's room for meditation, even to madness, Till the mind burst with thinking. Fair Penitent.Till my brain burst with thinkingâevery tongue Shall chaunt the beauteous Sculliona's name. In verse immortal I'll record thy charms; And when dear A little poem, or sonnet, which was sung by all Britons, who had the faculty of humming, or chanting. The sublimity of this little piece was so great, that the connoissieurs affirm'd it to be equal, if not superior to any of the odes, or sonnets, antiquity can boast. Dr. Humbug. Ally Crocar is forgot, Thou shalt be humm'd, or warbled thro' each street, From Hyde Park Corner to Limehousian Hole In plain prose, Limehouse-hole.. Scul. Our author, in this scene, hath given us a second proof of his knowledge of human nature, in preferring simplicity of expression to a chain of pompous words. In most of our modern tragedies, the chamber maid; or, to speak more politely, the confident, is drawn a person of better sense than the mistress (which is indeed sometimes the case) and her diction is generally more elevated; but our author shews his dislike of such practice, by making a chamber maid speak like a chamber maid. Dr. Humbug.That will be pure!âbut come; Trulletta waits. SCENE III. A Parlour. Madrigal, Trulletta. (meeting. Mad. My fair Trulletta! embracing. Trul. Oh! my Madrigal! embracing. Mad. Thou nature's whole perfection in one piece! Thou nature's whole perfection in one piece! Orphan. I'll hold thee thus, till we incorporate, An original image, and of double beauty of any I ever yet met with in the English language. Dr. Humbug.And make between us an hermaphrodite. So closely will I clasp thee in my arms, That the big wedge, which cleaves the knotted oak, Could hardly rend me from thy lov'd embraceâ Oh! my Trulletta, let me press thy lips, My eager, my devouring lips to thine, Devours his lips; eats him with hungry kisses. Alexander the Great. The expression of eating with hungry kisses is undoubtedly very sublime; but the same author in his Massacre of Paris, carries the image yet higher, where he says, And eat your Marguirite with your hungry eyes. The epithet hungry is frequently used by tragic authors, which may probably be occasion'd by the hunger they so often experience. The sublime Mr. Banks, in his Earl of Essex, hath the elegant phrase of hungry nostrils: with hungry nostrils waits for my blood, which last word I am apt to imagine an error of the press: I am of opinion it ought to be read snuff, as snuff is almost the only food for the nostrils. Dr. Humbug.And eat thee with my hungry kissesâNow Ye envying deities Olympian! Aquatic! and Infernal! see, behold! An author of less sagacity, would have only desired the gods to look down. Dr. Humbug.Look down, look upâconfessâbut speak the truthâ In my opinion a very reasonable injunction. Ibid. Say, would you not ungod yourselves, to be The happier Madrigal? to clasp her thus? Thus, thus to strain her to your panting bosoms? To suck th'Ambrosia of her Hybla lips? To banquet on her eyes? to be, like me, This is the most superlatively grandest expression, I have met with in any dramatic author, and may justly be called, a carrying the English language, as far as it can possibly go. Dr. Humbug.So more than most superlatively blest. Trul. Alas, my Madrigal! Mad. That deep-fetch'd sigh, Sorrow's sad offspring, speaks thy tender soul An epithet of vast use, and beauty. Ibid.Lab'ring with woeâthy brilliant eyes appear Studded with pearly dropsâoh! let me kiss them off, These richer jewels, than embowell'd lie In pregnant India's gem-prolific wombâ The most brilliant thought, that ever issued from the womb of the human brain. Ibid. Why all this grief?âand is it thus we meet?â Yes, I must chide; perforce, must chide thee, fair one: But oh, our meeting was not like the former! Fair Penitent. See 38th note of this act.For, oh! our meeting is not like the former; When every look, when all our talk was loveâ ? And all our talk was love. Orphan. Yes, changeful beauty! once there was a time, When my Trulletta rush'd into my arms, Swift as the iron messengers of death, Forc'd from the mortal engines, whose wide throats And O! ye mortal engines, whose wide throats Th' immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit. Othello. Th' immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit. Trul. Well might'st thou think my heart encrusted o'er With marble; or insensible, as rocks, Should my unfilial niggard eyes refuse To sympathize my father's threaten'd ruin. Thou know'st the angry sentence of the law Hangs heavy o'er him, like a gather'd cloud; And, e'er to-morrow's journeying sun hath made His lucid progress to his noon-day summit, His thread of life, like an unheeded remnant, Must by the law's fell shears be cut in twainâ Ye gods! what havock does the Ye gods, what havock does ambition make Among your works! Cato. Our author hath certainly given the world the most striking instance of humanity, and universal benevolence, that was ever known. Though his bread depends on halter-making, yet this tender image is a sufficient evidence, that he prefers the welfare of his fellow creatures, to his own private interest. How few such instances of generosity are to be met with among the trading part of mankind! Dr. Humbug. halter make Among your works! Mad. Alas! angelic nymph; Even with a more, far more than filial woe, I mourn the good old Cabbagino's danger: For, should the fatal nooseâthe stinging thought Alas! hath bred ten thousand scorpions here, And given my very soul a fit of th' gripes: This line may possibly admit of a cavil among some quibbling criticks; but there are innumerable dramatic authorities to justify our author, and incontestably prove the soul is subject to the disorders of the body. Among such authorities is one of the judicious Aaron Hill, Esquire, who says in his Merope, And my shock'd soul aches at him. Now if the soul be liable to aches I would ask these pitiful carpers, the criticks, why it may not be as naturally subject to a fit of the gripes. Dr. Humbug. That cursed mercer for a web of velvetâ Web, did I say? by all the gods a remnant! A paultry remnant! scarce a yard! to bring Thy venerable father to the tree; 'Tis such infernal cruelty, and ire, My translator, Mr. Rone, hath render'd it horse-shoe bearded; but as circle-bearded is a more genteel and musical epithet, I have given it, as it now stands in the text.As circle-bearded Israelites would scornâ Yes; he shall feel the terrors of my rageâ The slave shall feelâI'll tear him all to pieces. By hell's grim king I willâin black and whiteâ I'll have a hundred hawkers bellow out, Before his doors, the venom of my page, In roar most dreadfully vociferousâ Oh! how I'll gall himâmay this carcase rot Our author, in this spirited image, which is taken from the Regicide, hath, in my opinion, follow'd the original too closely; for, with submission to so great a genius as the DOCTOR, loathsome banquet seems to border a little on the tipperarian idiom. Dr. Humbug. A loathsome banquet to the fowls of heaven, If e'er my breast admit a thought to bound, A single thought, the progress of my rage. Trul. May the revengeful bloodhound never feel A moment's respite from his gouty pangs: And all the racking pains, that flesh is heir to, ? That flesh is heir to. Hamlet. Shall he accumulated underbear. Mourning Bride.May he accumulated underbear! Eternal moths and mildews haunt his shop! When, o'er his pipe, th' exhilerating juice In the original it is compound quadruple; which phrase, I apprehend, is not so just as compound manifold. It is generally supposed that punch is sometimes made of more ingredients than four; especially when brew'd by the three-penny retailers. Dr. Humbug.Of punch, that compound manifold, he sips, May my dear father's grinning spectre rise, And snatch th' uplifted nipperkin away From his untasting lips! when from his glass Our author seems to have had an eye on the following passage in the dedication to Merope, viz. ? Life's evening gleam survey, Nor shake th' out-hast'ning sands, nor bid them stay. It may not be amiss to inform my less knowing readers, that the said dedication is in rhyme; and that it is indubitably the most sublime, and poetical dedication in the English language. There are such a variety of beautiful sentiments, figures, and metaphors in it, that it will bear reading over a thousand times. For my part, I must ingenuously own, the style is so very masterly and poetical, that I am not yet acquainted with all its beauties, tho' I have studied it like an enigma. Dr. Humbug, Of life th'out-hast'ning sands are shook, may fiends Hurry the wretch into a hell, more hot Ten thousandfold than elemental fire: Then snatch, half-roasted, snatch him to a mount In icy Zembla's keen-congealing clime: There let him freeze, ye gods! unpitied freeze, (kneels With shiv'ring limbs, blue nose, and chatt'ring teeth, A spectacle of horror!

Even too profusely mourn'd, thy father's dangerâ Madam, 'tis prudent, I confess it is; This, and the two following lines, verbatim, from the Brothers. But is it loving, as true lovers ought, To be so very prudent in our loves? What interruption this? A tragical interrogatory; which, without the imputation of plagiarism, may be used by any dramatic writer. SCENE IV. Madrigal, Trulletta, Sculliona, Scourella. Scul. Horror on horror! Scou. O inauspicious hour! Mad. Ha! what portends This tristful exclamation? Scul. I am come A secret to disclose, that would awake you, And I am come a secret to disclose, That might awake thee, wert thou dead already. Brothers. If the DOCTOR would be kind enough to give up to the publick this grand restorative nostrum, I am persuaded he would have the thanks of a great many widows and orphans, who are starving for want of their deceas'd supporters. Dr. Humbug. Were you already dead.âMy dearest masterâ Scou. Alas! that I should ever live to tell it!â This interrupted manner of telling a melancholy story, is used by a variety of tragic authors. Scul. The best of masters, and the best of friendsâ Scou.

Despairing of reprieve (the turnkey thus Reports) and nobly scorning to be dragg'd A publick spectacle up Holborn Hill, By plenteous draughts of Juniperian juice, Death-dealing liquid, his undaunted soul, Freed from corporeal limbo. Trul. Oh! The vocal picture of grief in miniature, and of great service to tragic writers, as it frequently helps to set a broken verse on its heroick legs. For example: But oh, our meeting was not like the former! Fair Penitent. To touch thee's heaven; but to enjoy theeâoh, Thou nature's, &amp;c. Orphan. And I'm relaps'd into a cowardâoh, Bear me, &amp;c. Abra-Mule. Mad. Oh! Scul., Scou. Oh! Mad. The deed was worthy of a Roman soul: This line is borrow'd, but I cannot recollect from whom. Dr. Humbug. And sad necessity makes all things just. A maxim, that may probably be of some comfort to future criminals at the foot of the gallowsâI had almost forgot to inform the reader, this line is in Merope. Trul. Oh! 'tis too much; and life and I are lost. This beautiful line may be found in Merope also. (faints. Mad. Alas! she faints: she dies:âScourella, haste; Swift as a witch upon a broomstick fly; Nay, swifter than the lightning's swiftest speed, And bring a son of Galen to her aidâ Among the many bleeding heroines I have seen on the British stage, I remember but one, whose lover had the presence of mind to call an Ãsculapian to her assistance.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Street. Strapada. A yearning fondness hangs about me still: A woman's softness hangs about me still. Fair Penitent. I'd give the empire of ten thousand worlds Our author could not have given a finer demonstration of the virtuous and philosophical character of Strapada, than in this and the following line. I could wish that all mankind would imitate our virtuous cobler in the conscientious observance of his vow. He hath so strict a regard to what he has sworn, that he would even give the empires of ten thousand worlds for the bare privilege of unswearing a rash oath. The height of that yearning fondness to Buckramo, as our author most pathetically expresses it, could not be more strongly drawn, than in these two happy lines. Dr. Humbug. For privilege to unswear what I have swornâ His father was my friend, and taught me first, This and the two succeeding lines are a distant imitation of somewhat in the character of Horatio, in the Fair Penitent. With curved awl, to pierce the rugged soal, And join the horny bristle to the thread. Such benefits demand no vulgar gratitudeâ His mother tooâbe hush'd, my fluttering soulâ A tragical lullaby, frequently met with in drama. Dr. Humbug. Goosino tells me, he resolves on blood; A rival's blood: yet, which of them must fall None but th' Olympian gods alone can tell. Th' event of battle, like a growing fÅtus, Lies 'prison'd in futurity's dark womb, Till midwife time do bring it into birthâ Whoe'er the conqueror, Buckramo dies; For should he Madrigal's quietus make It would be loss of time to tell the reader this image is borrow'd from Shakespear. With a bare bodkin, justice acts the second, And brings the victor to the shameful treeâ It is resolv'd This laconic sentiment may be found in almost every tragedy, but it is a plagiarism from the speech of Prince Prettyman in the Rehearsal.âI'll watch him to prevent His rage, and save him from the double danger Of steel and hempen nooseâIt shall be so: It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Hamlet. Madness in taylors must not unwatch'd go. SCENE II. Strapada, Buckramo. Buck. My ears deceive me, or I heard the voice Of dear Strapada once; but, now alas! No more my friendâ'tis heâavenging steel! (puts up his bodkin. Rest here unseenâhis lab'ring mind is lock'd In contemplation's closest cellâI'll try To rouse him from this trance of thoughtâwhat, ho! Strapada! Strap. Ha!âBuckramo!âThou wast once My trustiest friend: in my heart's core I wore thee; Ay in my heart of hearts. In my heart's core I'll wear him; Ay, in my heart of hearts. Ibid. If we admit the heart to be form'd like an onion, I suppose this phrase means the innermost coat. Dr. Humbug. Buck. Ammonian Jove! As I cannot, with all my sagacity as an editor, trace any imitation of the following prayer, I must conclude it to be an original. Dr. Humbug. (kneeling. And all ye gods, and goddesses: peruse The folio of my past and present thoughts! Peruse it page by page, or in the way Of modern connoissieurs, videlicet, Run o'er contents and indexâif you find A wish, unless to have Trulletta mine, Preferr'd to good Strapada's dearest friendship, Hurl my thrice-thankless spirit vengeful down Into th' infernal pitchy lake, prepar'd For negro-soul'd ingratitude. Strap. By Saturn! ? By heaven! His father's in his face. Fair Penitent. His mother's in his faceâthe dear Scourellaâ It is too much to bearâspite of my vow This conflict in the bosom of Strapada plainly shews, that our author design'd to draw him a man, as well as a philosopher; two characters, which seldom meet in the same person; especially in dramatic philosophers. The struggle is so great, that the tenderness of the man overcomes the stiffness of the sage; and compells him to break that vow, which, a few minutes ago, he would have given the empire of so many thousand worlds to forswear with impunity. In the midst of the conflict, we still find him so great a friend to virtue, that he only pardons his repenting friend, on condition of his being virtuous. That this frailty, in regard to his vow, may not appear a blemish in the character of our heroic cobler, I must beg leave to inform my readers, that such breach of rash vows, in dramatic heroes, hath seldom or never been counted criminal. I could produce many instances of such frailty; that of Pierre in Venice Preserv'd may suffice, without quoting further authorities. Dr. Humbug.I must, I must relentâthere is a way To reinstate thee in my love: be virtuous. The friends of virtue are Strapada's friendsâ Forgo thy black design on Madrigal, And be as dear as everâwhat incites thee To seek his blood? Buck. He robs me of my mistress: And in return I rob him of his life. The robber rob, and robbery grows virtue. Our author seems to have had in view that moral and musical line, viz. Deceive deceivers, and deceit grows virtue. Merope. Strap. The subtlety of schools may paint this maxim; The schools, where learned error stalks abroad ? Faction stalks abroad In such gigantic strides. Virginia. A sentiment that stalks very majestically in the road of blank verse. Dr. Humbug.

Know, thou death's orator! dread advocate O thou death's orator! Dread advocate For bowelless severity! Brothers. A man must have no bowels, who cannot feel the force of these wonderful metaphors. Dr. Humbug. For bowelless severity! forgiveness Is greater, wiser, manlier bravery Than wild revenge. Buck. Ha! whither would'st thou lead me? Strap. To virtue, to forgivenessâtalk no more Of fell revenge. Buck. Not talk of it, Strapada? I'll talk of it, tho' hell itself should gape I'll talk of it tho' hell itself should gape, And bid me hold my peace. Hamlet. And bid me hold my peaceânot talk of it? Not of revenge? the attribute of th' gods, Revenge the attribute of gods; they stamp'd it With their great image on our natures. Venice Preserv'd. Who stamp it in our natures to impell Mankind to noblest darings. Strap. Rather call it The attribute of devils, stamp'd on man To draw deluded mortals to destruction. Buck. No more, no moreâtempt me no more in vainâ No more, no moreâtempt me no more in vain. Black Prince. My soul is wrought to the sublimest rage My soul is wrought to the sublimest rage Of horrible revenge. Regicide. A very sublime way of telling the world he is in a damn'd passion. This image, in my opinion, would be more proper and intelligible, if the word rage were alter'd to pitch. Dr. Humbug. Of horrible revenge. Strap. And thou art fix'd On bloody purpose? Buck. Fix'd as Cambrian mountain On its own base, or gaming lords on ruin. Our author seems to be led away by the prevailing opinion of Gaming, which paints it as the effect of idleness and prodigality; but I am not yet so much a slave to vulgar prejudice, as to suppose that idleness and prodigality are the sources of Gaming. Yet should we judge of its merits, from its prevalency in the fashionable world, we might rather esteem it to be the effect of a laudable desire of acquiring riches, and a praise-worthy calling; under which character the worst of men insinuate themselves into the company of gentlemen, and nobles. And I am of opinion that the philosopher's stone (notwithstanding all the labours of the chymical tribe) will be found, if ever it be found, by a gaming projector. Dr. Humbug. Strap. Then all my flattering hopes of thy reclaim Are lost; and my shock'd soul akes at thee And my shock'd soul akes at him. Merope. See note 23 of the second act.: yet Attend my last requestâdefer thy purpose, Till the cold earth, in her parental bosom, Receive thy venerable master's corse. E'er long the sad procession will begin: Then do not with unhallow'd broil prophane The dread solemnity of funeral rites: But lend thy kind assistance to support Thy sorrowing mistress thro' the mournful scene. This thou wilt promise? Buck. By yon silver lamp, Less metaphorically speaking, the moon. Which stringless hangs, or hangs by string unseen In azure firmament, I will! Strap. Till then farewel! SCENE III. Buckramo. Farewel!âtill then farewel!âso hot, my friend? So very hot?âno matterâlet him coolâ He thinks my reason a meer babe, a suckling, To need the leading-strings of his adviceâ But to th' intermentâif I should appear In this unseemly dress, they'll think I come To laugh and fleer at their solemnity. To fleer and scorn at our solemnity. Romeo and Juliet. Custom, that great, that venerable tyrant Custom, a venerable tyrant. Tancred and Sigismunda. On such occasions, asks, requires, demands A coatâa coat!âalas!âI have no coat. In this, and the four following lines, our author hath imitated the complaint of Othello for the loss of his wife. Oh insupportable!âoh heavy hour! Methinks it now should be a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, that the affrighted globe Should yawn at the alteration of my dressâ Of all superfluous cloth necessity Buckramo's condition seems to resemble that of Sharp in the Lying Valet.

Dr. Humbug.Without a clew to guideâO dark estate Of dull mortality! where reptile man, With all his boasted intuition, is More blind than reptile moleâGoosino's counsel Must guide me thro' this maze.

Ibid.Hail venerable ghost! Hail heart-wept Manes of my murder'd sire! O earth-wrong'd goodness!âin Newgatian cell, This inimitable description of Newgate is taken (with very little alteration) from the Brothers.That subterranean sepulchre of peace, That home of horror, hideous nest of crimes, Guilt's first sad stage in her dark road to hell, Whose thick-barr'd, sunless passages for air Do keep alive the wretch, that longs to die, Was thy majestic eye-beam clos'd in blood. Merope. A very majestic description of murder; but rather too much on the sublime for common capacities.âIn compassion to the benighted understandings of my countrymen in general, I could wish the publisher of the sublime tragedy of Merope would, in his next edition of that wonderful production, annex a glossary, that the beauties of that piece might be more universally understood, and comprehended by those, who have not had the good fortune of an academical education. Dr. Humbug.Was thy majestic eye-beam clos'd in gin; In the 18th century, the inhabitants of Great Britain were very much addicted to drinking a liquid, call'd Geneva; or, according to its usual abbreviation, gin, which was a slow, but sure poison. They swallow'd it, as the Turks do opium, meerly for the sake of intoxication. The consumption of this liquid was so great, that some thousands of poisoners general, distinguish'd by the modest appellation of distillers, got their livelihood; nay, some of them amass'd immense fortunes by the composition of this inebriating spirit. So great was the skill of these chymical poisoners, that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from molosses, juniper-berries, turpentine; nay, I believe, had they set about it, from the upper leathers of old shoes; but the chief, and most beneficial principles, from which they could possibly draw this fatal juice, were wheat, barley, or other grain. In the years 1757 and 1758, on account of the real, or artificial scarcity of grain in England, these gentry were prohibited the use of it, which so affected the distillery, that, happily for the nation, several of its professors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades, and launch into less destructive callings. During such prohibition it was remark'd, that human excrement, both a priori and a posteriori bore an advanced price, which might probably arise from the use of these fragrant materials in distillery. This conjecture is not at all unnatural, as bread and porter, after they have undergone the internal operations, must still retain some remaining part of their wheaten and malten qualities. For my part, I am almost confirm'd in this opinion, from the near analogy of flavour between gin, and that more solid species of excrement, on which the honour of knighthood hath been time immemorial conferr'd. After so long a note, it will be almost unnecessary to prove the truth and propriety of our author's stiling gin, the bliss and bane of human life; especially as drunkenness seems to be the primary happiness of the present age. This note I have written partly for the present, and partly for the future tense. Dr. Humbug.In gin, that bliss, and bane of human lifeâ O could my pious drops recall thy breath, My sluicing eyes should pour such cataracts This seems to have been drawn from the following beautiful lines: Pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate, That were the world on fire, they might have drown'd The wrath of heaven, and quench'd the mighty ruin. Mithridates. Of ceaseless tears, as would redeluge earth, And pickle the huge mass in human brineâ The napping of the gods is very frequently intimated by tragic authors. Dr. Humbug.O all ye sleeping gods! why did you thus Nod o'er your charge supine, and suffer one, So sagely form'd, to close his death-shrunk reign, Sagely-form'd, and death-shrunk reign: two dramatic flourishes of the author of Merope. By copious swill of gin lethiferous? Ye should have dash'd the untasted moisture from himâ Did he not dash th'untasted moisture from him. Cato. But hence this prophanation! 'tis impiety To question the just gods, since reason's line And reason's line wants depth to sound heaven's will. Merope. Here are two technical terms, viz. line and sound, which it behoves me to explainâThe line in the text is a lead or deep sea line, a species of cordage, about three quarters of an inch in circumference; to which is fix'd a quantity of lead to make it gravitate, or sink to the bottom more expeditiously, when thrown into the sea to find the depth of water; which is called sounding. This, by the by, is a kind of proof that Mr. Hill imagin'd the will of heaven to lie below, and not, as commonly suppos'd, above. If Mr. Hill, in this remarkable image, had written length instead of depth, it would have been much more clear and intelligible; but as obscure phrases are generally more poetical than common ones, Mr. Hill was undoubtedly in the right to give the word, as it now stands in the text. Wants depth to sound th' Olympian will. SCENE V. Trulletta, Ghost. Some of our modern connoissieurs in drama mistakenly suppose, a ghost is a kind of unnecessary agent in tragedy. To those learned gentlemen, who are of such infidel opinion, I beg leave to recommend the authority of no less ingenious and judicious a writer, than Mr. John Gay, of facetious memory, who in his What d'ye call it, puts into the mouth of the sagacious Sir Roger this conclusive argument, on the necessity of ghosts in dramatic exhibitions, viz. A play without a ghost is likeâis likeâegad it is like nothing. Dr. Humbug. Trul. Dread powers! What would your awful messenger? A seeming imitation of Ye heavenly guards, what would your gracious figure! Hamlet. Ghost. I am Thy father's spirit, doom'd for many years To fry in liquid lakes of subtlest fire, T'attone my manifold, my deadly sins Of cabbage, and high bills. Trul. Alas! poor ghost! Ghost. My furlo from my prison-house is short: Brief let me beâI come to warn my child Againstâbut hark! th' infernal boatswain calls! (A whistle within. He pipes me hence!âmy wasted respite grants No longer stayâagain!ârelentless dog! I come.âbut this short prayerânot for my self; Not for my self, but theeâhear me, all-graciousâ SCENE VI. Trulletta. 'Tis wanting what should followâJove should follow; An imitation of Osmyn's complaint in the Mourning Bride. But 'tis torn offâwhy should that word alone Be torn from his petition? Quere, whether a word, with as much propriety, may be said to be torn off from a verbal, as from a written petition?âThis I recommend as a question to be debated by a certain disputing society. Dr. Humbug.âwhy, indeed? SCENE VII. This, and the two foregoing scenes, (in imitation of many of our modern tragedies) appear to be introduced on Mr. Bayes's principle, viz. âWhat a devil is the plot good for but to bring in fine things?â Madrigal, Trulletta. Mad. Hail to you horrors! hail thou house of death! Hail to you horrors! hail thou house of death! And thou, the lovely mistress of these shades. Fair Penitent. And thou, the mournful mistress of these shades!â But, ha! what means this quivering in thy limbs? This terror in thy eyes? these ghastly looks? This image is taken from the greatest connoissieur in human nature that ever existed, I mean our inimitable Shakespear.Even such a form, so faint, so spiritless, So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone, Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night, And told the mournful tale of blazing Troy. Trul. Alas! some sudden ruin waits Trullettaâ My father's spirit hath been here to warn me 'Gainst something fatal, but I know not what; For just as he began the tender caution, A noise, not much unlike the catcall's knell, Abridg'd the mournful tale, and down he sunk Reluctant; yet obedient to the sound. Mad. O day and night, but this is wond'rous strange! This line from Hamlet. The world's last groan, wrapt in surrounding fires, This line, and succeeding hemistic, from Merope. Had less amaz'd me!âwas he cloath'd, or naked? Trul. Cloath'd in his 'custom'd garb from top to toe. Mad. Wore he his beaver on his head?âor cap With cat-skin lin'd? Trul. His head arm'd cap a-pe. Mad. With, or without his apron? Trul. With it, Love! Mad. His sandalsâshoes, or slippers? Trul. One of each. Mad. His beard was red? Trul. It was, as thou hast seen it, Almost the colour of the rising moon. Mad. Seem'd it not sing'd? The above interrogatories, with the major part of the foregoing scene between Trulletta and the ghost, an imitation of Hamlet. Trul. Not in the least. Mad. That's strange!â I would I had been there! Hamlet.I would I had been here!âit must portend Some festinating evilâbut to whom, Or what, my comprehension fathoms not: It hath been often observ'd, that mechanics generally speak in the terms of their respective callings. The word fathoms is a proof, that our author is not free from this almost-universal absurdity. Dr. Humbug. This is however sure, so sage a ghost Would hardly come on an unmeaning errand. But more of this hereafterâcome, my Love! The sad procession waitsânow summon all Thy reason's fortitude to grapple with Affliction's potenceâhark!â(Bell sounds.) that dreadfull knell O Cabbagino, is thy passing-bell. A Procession.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment. Madrigal, Trulletta. Mad. Thy last sad duties to thy sire are paid: The grave hath op'd its consecrated maw To swallow down thy father's hallow'd corse. For the benefit of our less learned readers, we have thought proper to signify, that the Stygian tar is Charon, the owner of the infernal ferry boat.The Stygian tar no longer can refuse His spirit passage to th' Elysian shades. SCENE II. Madrigal, Trulletta, Sculliona. Scul. Oh! Sir, these wretched eyes have newly seen Buckramo skulking 'hind a cobler's stall. Some hint's officious note had reach'd his ear Those who are acquainted with the sublimity of Mr. Hill's style, need not be inform'd from whom this line is borrow'd. Dr. Humbug. That you was hereâIn his right hand he bore, Most terrible to tell! a glitt'ring bodkin; And ask'd, if I had seen you: I replied, (Forgive me, Jove, the pious falshood!) no: On which, with sullen aspect, he rejoin'd; âWell! I may meet him e'er the noon of night.â That is, I presume, when the moon is in her meridian, and not as commonly suppos'd, at midnightâMany tragic authors are fond of this beautiful phrase. Dr. Humbug. Lean wolves forget to howl at night's pale noon. Theodosius. But see where silent, as the noon of night, These lovers lie. Regicide. Mad. Where is the stall, my gentle Sculliona? This line, and the remaining part of the speech from Hamlet. Our hero seems to be in greater earnest than the young Dane, as he flies with greater expedition to his revenge.Haste me to know't, that I with wings as swift As meditation, or the thoughts of love, May fly to my revenge. Trul. A breathless horror I am persuaded our author would scarce have ventur'd on this expression, if he had not found it in so correct a writer, as the author of Eugenia, for fear of incurring the charge of an Iricism. How breathless horror can heave panting at the heart, is not very obvious to human understandings; but Mr. Francis must have undoubtedly been satisfied of the possibility of such an effect, or he would hardly have made use of the expression. Dr. Humbug. Heaves panting at my heart!âIndeed, my Love, You must not hence to night: the time is big With danger. Mad. What! be coop'd within these walls; Thro' fear of one base cross-legg'd animal, But the ninth part of manhood?âby Alcides! Were there a hundred of the prick-louse tribe, With each a hundred bodkins in his hands, I could, with steadfast, and advancing scorn, I could with steadfast, and advancing scorn, Look in death's face full-sighted. Merope. What could a DRAWCANSIR have said more? Stare in each phyz, full-sightedâI'll be gone, And sacrifice a hecatomb of taylors And sacrifice a hecatomb of priests. Victim. Wak'd wrath, every body knows, is a phrase of Shakespear.To my wak'd wrath, while mercy's faintest glympse Shall shun to reach them. And mercy's faintest glympse shall shun to reach me. Merope. Happy was it for literature, that this great line did not shun to reach the sublime skull of Aaron Hill, Esquire. Dr. Humbug. Trul. Madrigal! forbear, And do not rush on such eventful broil. Mad. If all their lice were lives, If all his hairs were lives, my great revenge Has stomach for them all. Othello. my great revenge Has stomach for them all. Trul. And canst thou leave me, Disconsolate to mourn thy rashness?âhast thou So soon forgot me? Mad. Do not rive my heart Why will you rive my heart with such expressions? Cato. With such unkind expressionsâDidst thou say Forget thee?âmuch indeed must be forgot, ? Much must be forgot, E'er Tancred can forget his Sigismunda? Tan. and Sigis. E'er Madrigal forget his fair Trullettaâ The gods, that pry into the close recesses Of every heart, can evidence the love, The wond'rous love I bear theeâNow, even now, A flow of fondness gushes from my eyes: And did not honour's call command me hence, I would not leave thee for the laurell'd wreath, That binds a Milton's, or a Shakespear's brow; The sirnames of two bards, that will be an honour to Great Britain as long as her present language is known. The first the greatest epic poet that ever existed; the last so great a dramatic genius, that to him (to imitate his own phrase) ? All the NINE did seem to set their seals, To give the world assurance of a bard. To this note Dr. Humbug hath added, âI am sorry to inform the world, these two immortal men were such latitudinarians in morals, that the former was a rebel, and the latter a deer-stealer.â But, throwing thus my arms about thy neck, If, throwing thus my arms about thy neck, I play the boy, and blubber in thy bosom: Oh, I shall drown thee with my sorrows. Venice Preserv'd. Would play the boy, and blubber in thy bosom Till I had drown'd thee with my streaming tears. Trul. And is it possible that thou should'st love, Yet leave me thus inhumanly? Mad. Forbear Cast to the ground this unprevailing woe. Hamlet. This unprevailing woeâAlas! 'tis more Than death to see thee weep! An expression dragg'd into almost every tragedy.âbut we must partâ O! I could curse this idle bubble, honour; This fashionable frenzy, that enslaves The mob polite, that tears me from thy arms?â Farewel, my Love!âwhy dost thou hang upon me?â Release me! give me way!âlet go my arm! Trul. Thou shalt not leave me. Mad. Shalt not! have a care; Thou'lt wake the slumb'ring lyon in my breast: Our author hath borrow'd this image, but I cannot satisfy the reader's curiosity from whence. Dr. Humbug. Do not provoke my rage too farâthou know'st My hasty temperâquit thy stubborn hold, Or, by the gods, I'll force thee to forego it! Trul. Behold my streaming eyesâ Mad. Ha! shall the tears This hemistic, and the four following lines, which, for their sublimity, may be rank'd with any in the English language, are taken verbatim from Boadicia. Of abject importunity detain me, While vengeance, striding from his grizly den With fell impatience, grinds his iron teeth, And waits my nod, to satisfy his hunger?â Not all the tears, that ever yet were shed, Could stop my rapid courseâMay Jove exhaust ? May heaven exhaust Its thunders on my head; may hell disgorge Infernal plagues to blast me, if I cease To persecute the caitif till his blood Assuage my parch'd revenge. Regicide. His thunder on my head! may hell disgorge Infernal plagues to blast me, if I cease To persecute the Prick-louse, till his blood Assuage my parch'd revengeâOh! my Trulletta! ? Oh Rossano! Or give me way, or thou'rt no more my friend. Fair Penitent. Or give me way; or thou'rt no more my friend. Trul. Help, Sculliona! Sculliona, help To save my raging bard! Mad. To save me so, ? To save him so, Were but to lose him surer. Merope. Very sublime and laconic! Dr. Humbug. Were but to lose me surerâquit me, fair ones! Trul. For pity's sakeâ Mad. With thee a kneeling world As I cannot recollect from what author I have borrow'd this sentiment, I should take it as a favour, if the said author, or his ghost would give me a letter (post paid) to inform me in which of his performances it may be found; in which case I assure him, that honourable mention shall be made of it in the next publication of this tragedy, if my bookseller have the good fortune to get off the present edition, and courage to venture on a second. Should sue in vainâUnhand me, gentlewomen! ? Unhand me, gentlemen; By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me. Hamlet. By hell! I'll make a ghost of her that lets me!â Nay 'tis in vain to striveâno force can hold meâ Let Broughton, or let Slack do what he may, This, and the following line, a parody from the tragedy last mention'd. As these two heroes are so universally known, it would be loss of time to say any thing about them. Dr. Hum. The cat will mew, and dog will have his day. (breaks from them. SCENE III. Trulletta, Sculliona. Trul. Then go, inhuman bard! begone for everâ I vainly hop'd Trulletta's eyes had power To check th' impetuous sallies of his rageâ So have I heard, with equal suddenness, This simile, which, for its beauty, propriety, elegance, (and I may justly add, conciseness) for it only consists of twelve lines, may be called the master-piece of simile. Allowing the alterations of seate for dolphin, and lobster for whale; it is almost verbatim as in the sublime original, which may be found in the close of the third act of Abra-Mule, a tragedy written by a Levitical play-wright.âMy punning friend, on reading this simile, replied, âSo, I see you understand TRAP.â Ebbing prodigiously the sea withdraw, And quite defenceless left the scaly race. The huge scate, which e'er while with wanton pride Spread his broad fins, and lash'd the foaming tide, Vainly essay'd to suck the faithless flood With heaving gills, and tumbled in the mud. The lobsters, whose great trunks the stars could reach Flounc'd their huge claws, and panted on the beach. So have my hopes, whose waves e'er while ran o'er, And to the skies my towering wishes bore, Retir'd, and left me gasping on the shore. SCENE IV. The Street. Madrigal. Where is this heroe, famous and renown'd For wronging innocence, and breaking vows. Orphan.Where is this hero, famous and renown'd For killing vermin, and for botching cloaths?â What ho! Buckramo! SCENE V. Madrigal, Buckramo. Buck. Ha! who calls Buckramo, With lungs so loud, and vehemence so great? Is it the voice of thunder, or of man? Buckramo seems to be in the same perplexity with Calista, where she says, Is it the voice of thunder, or my father? Fair Penitent. That such mistake in sounds may not appear unnatural, to the tragic already quoted, I shall add a comic authority, which comes from the mouth of no less ingenious a personage, than Mr. Scrub in the Stratagem. Archer. âDid you hear nothing of Mrs. Sullen?â Scrub. âI did hear something that sounded that way, but whether it was Sullen or Dorinda I could not distinguish.â Mad. Of one, that comes to scourge thy insolence, Presuming arrogant! unletter'd slave! The altercation in this scene between our two heroes, seems to be a distant imitation of that spirited conference between Horatio and Lothario in the Fair Penitent. Thou little more than a bare tythe of manhood! Buck. The lewdest sland'rer, that e'er broach'd abuse, One would naturally imagine from this verse, that Mr. Theobald, whom envy itself (notwithstanding Pope's sarcasm, viz. Shakespear of Tibbald sore) must allow to be a judicious editor, had been a tapster, as well as a critick and play-wright âThe curious reader may find the above image in the Fatal Secret. Dr. Humbug. Came short of thisâTake note, take note, O god, Take note, take note, O world. Othello. Of this reproachful calumnyâThis railer, With breath envenom'd, impiously affirms, Your human figures are but decimals, But tythes of manhoodâVile, licentious cur! The very dogs would spurn thy wretched carcase; Becauseâit scarce would furnish out a meal. Go hence! buy food! and get thee into flesh! ? buy food and get thee into flesh. Romeo and Juliet. 'Twould grieve my very soul to grace a gibbet For killing but a shadow. Mad. This from thee! Thou seeming semblance of the human form, Made from the shreds, and clippings of mankind! A king of shreds and patches. Hamlet. Are not thy cross-legg'd tribe th'unsifted mold, The dross, the leavings of humanity? Nay, by the powers! your composition is Of baser matter still, the lumpish dregs, The refuse vile of animal creation! The criticks, a set of snarling people, that right or wrong, must always be finding fault; have establish'd it for a standing rule, that dramatic heroes must never be allow'd to degenerate into Billingsgate scolds. If authorities were necessary to refute this absurd restriction, I could bring a whole string of examples from our best play-wrights, ancient and modern, to prove the legality of sarcastic raillery and altercation in tragedy. The immortal Shakespear makes his Danish heroe call his father-uncle-sovereign A cut-purse of the empire. A king of shreds and patches. A vice of kings. and a great many other names. Rowe makes Lothario call his opponent a tavern-bully, slave, villain, beggar, parasite, &amp;c. These authorities (to mention no others) will certainly justify the use of a few sarcastic appellations. Dr. Humbug. Buck. Dost thou compare the fashioners of man With these base botchers of the verseful train? What are ye but a shrivel'd, half-starv'd race Of living skeletons? shadows of shadows? With brains of whirligigs, and limbs of reeds? A cringing, lying, snarling, monkey tribe, Probably an imitation of A skipping, dancing, worthless tribe you are. Fair Penitent.

To-morrowâoh! my better stars, to morrow!â I cannot help taking notice that our hero's address to the stars is much more rational, than that of Lothario, who says, To-morrowâoh, my better stars, to-morrow Exert your influence, shine strongly for me! Fair Penitent. The combat propos'd by the Genoese duelists was to be at ten in the morning; wherefore a petition for the stars to shine strongly for him in the forenoon, must certainly border a little on the absurd. Our author was within an ace of falling into Mr. Rowe's mistake; but perceiving the blunder, he sensibly checks himself, and adds, My gracious stars, I mean to-morrow night. Dr. Humbug. (My gracious stars! I mean to-morrow night) Exert your influence! shine strongly for me!â But, wherefore should I doubt?ânow will I steal To my dear Love, and with assuasive sounds Allay her sorrow's fermentâ (knocks at the door.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An Apartment. (Thunder and Lightning. Trulletta, Scourella. Trul. Heaven's! 'tis a fearful night! Many of our tragic authors have judiciously usher'd in a dreadful night, by way of prologue or preparative to the catastrophe of their plays. Such preparative seldom fails of success, as it throws a gloomy melancholy o'er the mind, and renders the reader, or audience, more susceptible of the ensuing distress of the performance. It further serves to heighten the character of the hero, or heroine; for certainly nothing can be a stronger proof of the dignity and importance of any personage, than when we are convinced, that even nature itself is mourning the impending fall of her favourites. Scour. Tho' age hath snow'd ? Till age Hath snow'd a hundred winters on thy head. Constantine. The word snow'd, in the sense now implied, is a favourite metaphor with a variety of authors; yet I am of opinion the thought would be mended, if it were chang'd to hail'd. Almost thrice twenty winters on my head, I never saw a night so terribleâ Most terrible indeedâThe moon's eclips'd; ? This dull flame Sleeps in the socket. Fair Penitent.The stars sleep in their sockets: scarce a ray Of light t'illume the welkin's pitchy cope, But what the sheeted light'ning's flash affords. The bursting thunder roars with frightful crack, As if heaven's magazines were blowing up. The blust'ring Boreas, like a bully, storms, And threatens to unhinge earth's mass, which rocks Affrighted on its axis, like a sign. Owls, magpies, ravens on the chimney tops Screech, chatter, croak: geese cackle, crickits chirp, Dogs howl, cats mew, pigs squeak, and asses bray, In concert dissonant. This speech is certainly the finest night piece that ever was drawn Dr. Humbug. Trul. 'Tis said, strange sights Our author, in the following speech, seems to have had the prodigies in Julius CÃ¦sar in view. Ibid. Appear ith' air? Scour. Ten thousand hags and wizzards, On broomsticks mounted, thro' the frightful sky Gallop apace their fiery footless steedsâ Gallop apace your fiery-footed steads Romeo and Juliet. Squadrons of bodkins, press-boards, yardwands, sheers, 'Gainst penknives, sheets of paper, inkhorns, quills, Appear drawn up in battailous array What a triumph must this, and a few of the preceding lines, afford a half-finish'd critick? how will he swell with his wonderful discovery? Methinks I hear him exulting to the following effect.ââI thought I should catch our author tripping! A few lines ago he tells us it was a very dark night; and yet an old woman of sixty, whose sight we may naturally imagine to be none of the best, is able to discern with the naked eye such minute objects as bodkins and inkhorns in the air.â To such critick I shall reply, and pray what is there unnatural in all this? Might not the light'ning enable our matron to make such discovery? Tho' her eyes were none of the best, yet she might discern these objects through her spectacles; nay, possibly, thro' a telescope. But pray, Sir, who inform'd you of the size of bodkins and inkhorns, which you arbitrarily call such minute objects? Not our author I'm confident. For any thing you know to the contrary, they might be as large as a maypole; nay, as the Monument itself. In short, Sir, if you knew any thing of the figure Hyperbole, which every author hath a right to use, you would have been silent on this occasion.âBesides, with all your sagacity, you cannot even tell whether Scourella really saw them or no; from the relation she gives, she may be as naturally suppos'd to have taken the account from those that had seen them, as that she had seen them herself, for it is no uncommon thing now-a-days to see with other people's eyes. Dr. Humbug.â Such sights seem certain prologue to the fall Of mightiest empires, or the crush of worlds. Trul. What is this puny tempest in the sky, To that my bosom feels! my mind's surcharg'd With ominous presageâNo joy, no comfort Remains, but what the hopes of lengthen'd life To Sculliona leaveâwould I were plac'd With my dear father in his cold last bed!â I shall not long survive him. SCENE II. Trulletta, Scourella, Buttonelli, Thimbletonio. Trul. Buttonelli, And Thimbletonio, have you seen my bard? But., Thim. We have. Trul. Thanks, Buttonell; and, gentle Thimbletonio. King. Thanks, Rosencraus, and gentle Guildenstern. Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern, and gentle Rosencraus. Hamlet. Scour. Thanks, Thimbleton; and, gentle Buttonelli. Trul. Is he alive and well? But. He and Buckramo, With each a hundred squires, are now preparingâ Thim. For dire encounter on the plains of Smithfield. Scour. O fly with me, Trulletta! and prevent The broil fraternal. Trul. Broil fraternal! ha!â Let all, except Gonsalez, leave the room. Mourning Bride.Let all, except Scourella, leave the roomâ (Exeunt But. and Thim. What mean'st thouâby fraternal? Scour. Ask no more; The secret I'll unravel as we go. SCENE III. West-Smithfield. (a flourish. Madrigal, Lyric, Acrostic, Fustiano, Epigram, and their party. Mad. The storm subsides: the full-orb'd moon illumes, With silver beams, yon cloudless canopy, And seems, my friends! to smile upon our cause As the sun, by a variety of tragic writers, is describ'd capable of laughing, I hope it will not be denied our author to paint the moon capable of smiling.â My fellow-warriors! brethren of the muse! Remember this is the Pharsalian field, That must immortalize the name of Bard, Or blast it with eternal infamyâ But hark! yon trumpet speaks th'approaching foeâ Charge you their right, AcrosticâI and Lyric The centerâFustiano, you the leftâ You, Epigram, must wheel your phalanx round, And, as your rhyming custom always is, Gall, sting them in the rearânow draw your inkhorns, And on them make this great, this solemn vow, (Or else my penknife, with unbatter'd edge, Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge, I'll sheath again undeeded. Macbeth. As I intend in a few months to give the world a compleat edition of Shakespear's works, in twenty volumes in folio, it may not, in this place, be amiss to give a specimen of my critical abilities. My 475th note on the tragedy of Macbeth runs thus: âThough all the stream of editions concur in reading, âOr else my sword with an unbatter'd edge, âI'll sheath again undeeded.â yet I am persuaded our immortal poet, who never wrote a line of fustian in his life, could not be guilty of such a turgid expression. I shall therefore propose three several readings, one of which our poet certainly wrote: 1. âOr else my sword with an unspatter'd edge, âI'll sheath again unspeeded.â as if he had said, or else my sword, with edge unsprinkled, or unsmear'd, with human gore, I'll sheath again unspeeded, i. e. unsuccessful. 2. âOr else my sword, with an unbattled edge, âI'll sheath again unbleededâthat is, unbloody. 3. âOr else my sword, with man-unbatten'd edge, âI'll sheath again in dead hide.â q. d. or else my sword, with edge unbatten'd, or unfatten'd with man, or the blood of man, I'll sheath again in dead hide; that is, in the scabbard. To illustrate this image more fully, it may not be amiss to add, that scabbards are generally made of dead hides, or leather. I am apt to think, from the analogy of sound between in dead hide, and undeeded, that such corruption hath crept into the text. Dr. Humbug. I'll sheath again undeeded) that each bard, Who 'scapes the battle's rage, in pompous lays Will paint the glories of a brother slain; That every son of verse, who falls this night, May live immortal in a brother's songâ The concern of our hero for the immortality of his poetical brethren, is certainly a very masterly stroke. Dr. Humbug. Your inkhorns to your lips Probably a distant imitation of But still your fingers on your lips, my friends. Hamlet.âthis do you swear; ? This do you swear, As grace and mercy at your most need help you. Hamlet. As rhyme and numbers at your most need help you. All. We swear. Mad. Then let us all embrace. Ac. Now on. Fus. The tecbir?

SCENE VIII. Madrigal, Lyric, and Bards in pursuit. Mad. As Mr. Bayes makes his two kings speak French to shew their breeding; our author makes his heroe speak Latin, to shew his education. A dash of Latin gives great spirit to tragic writings, and is often us'd with great success by dramatic authors. Victoria! Victoria! they fly!

I have read upwards of two hundred plays to find it, but in vain.âOur author acknowledges it is not his own, but cannot recollect from whom it is taken. Dr. Humbug. To die in Madrigal's blest arms. Mad. Alas! A very pertinent epithet as Trulletta was slain by a bodkin; and, in my opinion, as beautiful as the iron teeth in Boadicia. See note 18 in the fourth act.The iron hand of death is on theeâe'er Life's lamp be quite extinguish'd, speak, oh! speak Some peace, some comfort to thy mournful bard! Trul. May the shrill catcall's knell, the boxes sneer, This dying speech and prayer of our heroine is an original, and perhaps one of the finest pieces of dramatic painting in the whole world of literature. Dr. Humbug. The hiss of faction, or the templar's groan, Ne'er blast thy muse's offspring on the stage! But heels, sticks, hands, in thund'ring peals, attend Thy race dramatic to their thrice-third nightâ May ever-blooming laurels crown thy brow, And fameâimmortal fameâthe rest is silence. (Dies.

Got by a templar, while my father liv'd Our author, more sensibly to heighten the distress of the piece, hath judiciously brought about a discovery that cannot fail of having its proper effect. Discoveries of this kind, and introduced for the same purpose, are frequently met with in dramatic writings. Dr. Humbug. In cruel exile on Columbian shores! This cruel exile probably means transportation. This conjecture seems to be strengthen'd by what we are told of Buckramo's father in the first act, viz. that he pendent died On gallow tree. Ibid. Then I am sentenc'd to eternal woe!â Eternal? yes, eternal, and eternalâ Eternal? yes, eternal; and eternal. Brothers. Our author might have mended this line, both as to sense and sound, if he had not stuck so close to the DOCTORâas thus: Eternal? Yes, eternal; and infernal. Honour'd Scourella, had I known but this A little hour ago This handâ A little hour ago was given to me. Tan. and Sigis. By the phrase of little hour, I presume we are to understand about three quarters of an hour. Dr. Humbug. we might have liv'd In amity fraternalâbut alas! When stern Bellona seem'd, with step-dame look, To lour upon our arms, I daub'd this point And for this purpose I'll anoint my sword: I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortalâ that no cataplasm so rareâ âcan save the thing from death, That is but scratch'd withal. Hamlet. This long quotation I have thought proper to give, that the reader might not too hastily imagine the manner of our heroe's death in the least unnatural. Dr. Humbug.With unguent, bought of mountebank, so pois'nous, That if the Ãsculapian deity, Instead of my poor brother, had been scratch'd, ?

Whose looks malign, and yellow eyes bespeak A jaundic'd mind?âby hell! thou art the monster Yclep'd a critickâseize him, devils! seize him! Whip him with scorpion's stings, and rods of iron!

In the representation, instead of this line was added the following speech, which was supply'd by a brother author. Mr. Davis perform'd it so inimitably well, that he was oblig'd to rise from the dead to speak it a second time.

Our author took the hint, but could not be prevailed on to annex a moral. I expostulated with him, in the most friendly manner, on the necessity of such termination of the play; but he very obstinately and whimsically insisted, that a moral, unless drawn up in the epilogue, was unnatural, because it is an immediate address to the audience; which audience, the speaker, in his dramatic character, cannot with propriety suppose to be presentâthat it could not properly be spoken by any of the persons in the drama, unless such person had been present during the whole representation, and was consequently acquainted with every incident in the playâ that it was an affront to an audience, to suppose them incapable of drawing a moral from the representationâthat it was a modern custom, and, in his opinion, More honour'd in the breach, than the observance. Hamlet. that many judicious authors had shewn their dislike of such practise, particularly Gay, who severely satiriz'd it in his ingenious and pithy epilogue to the What d'ye call it, viz. Our stage-play has a moral, and no doubt You all have wit enough to find it out. and finally, that our immortal Shakespear seldom or never concluded any of his plays with a moral. He was so obstinate on the occasion, that it was with no small difficulty I could prevail on him to suffer me to annex the foregoing moral; which the reader may perceive is taken, with slight alteration, from the most finish'd tragedy, that any language hath yet produced, I mean Mr. Addison's Cato. As I have now ended my annotations, and occasionally scatter'd a few encomia on the play, it will be naturally expected I should give my summary opinion of its merits, which I shall deliver, not so much with the candour of the friend, as the impartiality of the critick. I shall divide the subject of my remarks into three heads, viz. the fable, the manners, and the diction. As to the fableâbut it had quite slipt my memory, that the printer's boy hath been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the finishing note, wherefore I must defer my criticism, till the next edition of this tragedy.

CHORUS. And do not then, &amp;c. CHIEF PRIEST. The longest life of mortal man, Is but a short, a little span; Then send not death, your ghastly porter, To cut that little span yet shorter. CHORUS. Then send not death, &amp;c. CHIEF PRIEST. Gog and Magog, hear, O hear! Gog and Magog, lend an ear! Gog and Magog hear, and save, Scully from a present grave! Scully's danger'd health restore, Gog and Magog, we implore! Gog and Magog, we implore, Scully's danger'd health restore! CHORUS. Gog and Magog hear, O hear! &amp;c.</field>

Never, never, to return! Mourn, lamenting Britons, mourn! Mourn your fate, your loss deplore; Wit and beauty are no more!</field>
