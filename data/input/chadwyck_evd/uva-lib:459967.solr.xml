      <field name="fulltext">? Quis talia fando Temperet à lachrymis? ? Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Her GRACE the Dutchess of Marlborough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. By a FRIEND. Spoken by Mr. GIFFARD. In former Times, when Wit was no Offence, And Men submitted to be pleas'd with Sense— Then was the Stage fair Virtue's Fav'rite School, Scourge of the Knave, and Mirror of the Fool. Here oft the Villain's conscious Blush wou'd rise, And Fools become, by viewing Folly, wise. Our Bard, as then, despises Song and Dance, The Notes of Italy, and Jigs of France. With home Distress he nobly hopes to move, And fire each Bosom with its Country's Love— So much a Briton—that he scorns to roam To Foreign Climes, to fetch his Hero home— Conscious, that in these Scenes is clearly shown Britain can boast true Heroes of her own. Murder avow'd by Law he boldly paints; Heroes and Patriots, Hypocrites and Saints: Rebellion fighting for the publick Good, And Treason smiling in a Monarch's Blood. Party, be dumb—in each pathetic Scene, Our Muse to-night asserts an honest Mean; Shews you a Prince triumphant o'er his Fate, Glorious in Death, as in Misfortunes Great: By Nature virtuous, tho' mis-led by Slaves, By Tools of Power, by Sycophants and Knaves. When Charles submits to Faction's deadly Blow, What loyal Heart but shares the Monarch's Woe. Nor less Maria's Grief, ye gentle Fair, Claims the sad Tribute of a tender Tear. From British Scenes to-night we hope Applause, And Britons, sure, will aid a British Cause.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Bishop Juxon and Duke of Richmond. JUXON. Good Day, my Lord; if in a Time like this, Aught that is fortunate or good can happen; When Desolation, wedded to Despair, Strides o'er the Land and marks her Way with Ruin: Plenty is fled with Justice; Rage and Rapine Have robb'd the widow'd Matron, England, quite, And left her now no Dow'ry—but her Tears. RICHMOND. Is it then certain that the lawless Commons Have form'd a Court of Justice (so they call it) To bring the King to Trial? JUXON. 'Tis most true: And tho' the Lords refus'd to join the Bill, Yet they proceed without 'em: Lawless Man! Whither at last will thy Impieties, Thy daring Insolence extend, when Kings Feel from a Subject-Hand the Scourge of Pow'r? Where may an injur'd Monarch hope for Safety, If he not find it in his Peoples Hearts? RICHMOND. O Naseby, Naseby! what a deadly Stroke Was thy ill-fated Field to Royalty! On thy Success depended Monarchy: The Fate of Rebels and the Fate of Kings Hung on thy Battle; but thou, faithless too, Conspir'd with Faction to o'erthrow us all, And bring to sight these more than bloody Times. JUXON. To-morrow does the black Tribunal sit; When Majesty is cited to appear Before his Tyrant-Subjects: O preposterous! Is't not as bad as if these Rebel-Hands Shou'd from their Seats tear forth the ruling Eyes, Whose Watch directs the Body's Use and Safety? RICHMOND. It cannot be! 'Tis not in Cruelty To think of spilling Royal Blood: Mercy sure, And the pretended Justice of their Cause, Will save 'em from the Weight of so much Guilt. JUXON. What added Guilt can that black Bosom feel, That has shook off Allegiance to its King? Whole Seas of common and of noble Blood Will not suffice, the Banquet must be crown'd, And the Brain heated with the Blood of Kings. But see where Cromwell comes! Upon his Brow Dissimulation stamp'd: If I can judge By Lineament and Feature, that Man's Heart Can both contrive and execute, the worst, And the most daring Actions yet conceiv'd. Ambitious, bloody, resolute and wise; He ne'er betrays his Meaning till he acts, And ne'er looks out but with the Eye of Purpose: His Head so cool, that it appears the Top Of Alpine Hill, clad with slow wasting Snow; His Execution rapid as the Force Of falling Waters thund'ring down its Base. Let us avoid him, for my conscious Soul Fears him in Wonder, and in Praise condemns him. [Exeunt. Enter CROMWELL. CROMWELL. Now, thro' the Maze of gloomy Policy, Has fire-ey'd Faction work'd her Way to Light, And deck'd Ambition in the Robe of Power. Our Fears in Charles's Safety are remov'd, And but one Blow remains to fix our State— The lopping off his Head. No more the Royal Tree Shall, from Legitimacy's Root, presume To sprout forth Tyrant Branches: Commonwealths Own no hereditary Right, unless our Worth Shine equal to our Birth: Wherefore at once Down with Nobility—The Commons rule! Avant Prerogative and Lineal Title, And be the Right to rise superior Merit. Enter FAIRFAX. FAIRFAX. I was to seek you, Sir, some lab'ring Doubts, Which, in the Uncertainty of these strange Times, Call for the Ray of Clearness, make me press (Perhaps unseasonably) to your Ear. You will forgive the Impatience of a Man, Who labours to be right—by your Example. CROMWELL. Good Fairfax, spare me; I am ill at Words, And utter badly where I mean Respect; Uncouth my Answers are to Truth and Plainness, But to a Compliment I ne'er cou'd speak: Yet cou'd you look into my secret Mind, There my Soul speaks to Fairfax, as to one Book'd in the fairest Page of my Esteem, And written on my Heart.—But to your Doubts. FAIRFAX. You may remember, Sir, when first my Sword, My Fortune, Life, and still yet more—my Honour, Were all engag'd to fight the Cause of Justice; You thought with me, the Wrongs to be redress'd Were the Attempts upon the Subjects Right, The unregarded Laws, and bold Design To stretch Prerogative to boundless Rule. Design full fair and noble! And th'Event, Has crown'd our utmost Wishes: England owns No arbitrary Sway; The King's Adherents Are all dispers'd, or the Remains so few, They are not worth a Fear; The King himself In close Confinement.—Now let Reason judge, And blend Discretion with Success. Let us be just—but let us stop at Justice, Nor by too hasty Zeal o'ershoot the Mark. The Roman Spirits, savage as they were, When they determin'd to abolish Kings, Shed not the Blood of Tarquin, but expell'd him: And shall we, Owners of the Christian Law, Where Mercy shines the foremost Attribute, Be harder to appease? If not more mild, Let us not be more cruel than Barbarians: Charles grasp'd, we own, at Arbitrary Sway, And wou'd have been a Tyrant—for which Crime The Kingdoms he was born to, we have seiz'd: But let us not despoil him of his Life. Crowns as the Gift of Men, Men may resume, But Life, the Gift of Heaven, let Heaven dispose of. CROMWELL. Well have you weigh'd each growing Circumstance, And held Discretion in the nicest Scale: Our Fears remov'd, the Subject Right restor'd; What have we more to do, than to sit down, And each enjoy the Vineyard of his Toil? 'Tis true: But yet some Clamours are abroad; Petitions daily crowd the Parliament, That loudly call for Justice on the King: Imputing to his Charge the Guilt of Murders, The Desolation that has bared the Land, And swept the Crops of Plenty from our Fields. FAIRFAX. What, shall the Rabble judge? those servile Curs, Who, as they eat in Plenty, snarl Sedition. Are these to be regarded? CROMWELL. You mistake me: 'Tis not their Outcries only; but indeed, Those who see farther, and with better Judgment, Fear while he lives, his Friends will never die, But by some Foreign Force or Home Design, May sometime shake the Safety of the State: Besides they speak of an approv'd good Maxim, “Remove the Cause and the Effect will cease. O worthy Fairfax! thou art wise and valiant: I have seen thee watch Occasion, 'till Advantage Came smiling to thy Arms: and crown'd thy Patience: And then in Fight, I have beheld thy Sword Out-fly the Pace of pestilential Air, And kill in Multitudes. FAIRFAX. Good Sir, forbear. CROMWELL. Blush not to hear a Truth, when Cromwell speaks it: My uncouth Manner, ill at varnishing, Beggars my Will, and dresses Praise uncomely. Methinks I see thee in the Rage of Battle, When Naseby's Field confest thy Victor Arm, And thy Decision was the Fate of Kings: Methinks I view thee midst the bustling Ranks, Where Danger was the nearest—(for you brought it) Unhelm'd encounter Armies, and despise The Safety that the meanest Soldier wore; And when a private Man with bold Assertion Challeng'd a Conquest which your Arm had gain'd, And was reprov'd; methinks I hear you say, “I have enough of Glory, let him own it. FAIRFAX. Whither does all this tend? I pray forbear— I never fought in hopes to have it told: The Man whose Actions speak, expects no Answer. CROMWELL. I do but barely tell thee what thou art, And what the World may yet expect of Fairfax. The Diamond, Merit, in the Quarry hid, Being unknown, unseen, attracts no Eyes, But digg'd up by the Lab'rer's Curiosity, And polish'd by the Hand of Gratitude, It shines the Ornament of human Life.— Think therefore what you are, and what this Juncture. The fairest Lock of Fortune is display'd, And should be seiz'd on by the bold and worthy. FAIRFAX. You talk in Clouds above my Purpose quite; Which was but to enforce the Cause of Mercy, And shew how much is gain'd by stopping here; To tell you what my Conscience makes Opinion, And strengthen that Opinion by your Voice. CROMWELL. 'Tis true indeed—I had forgot my self; But whither was I hurried in my Zeal? E'en I can descant on a pleasing Theme: Can you forgive me? tho' 'tis hard indeed; Exalted Virtue can with Ease forgive A Calumny, but not a Praise.—No more, Heav'n witness for me, with what true Accord My Thoughts meet yours! How willing I would stop The Arm of Violence and make the Law, Stern as she is, assume a Face of Smiles. The Death of Charles is far from my Design— And yet the general Outcry is for Justice: He has been much to blame, you know he has; And (but I soften those unruly Thoughts) Were I to speak the Dictates of my Heart, I cou'd not find a Punishment too great To fall upon the Man, who shou'd, like Charles, Forget all Right, and waste with lavish Hand The rich Revenue of his Peoples Love. FAIRFAX. Dearly he suffers for misguided Steps, And knows that Misery he meant to give; He feels the Bondage he design'd for us, And by the want of Freedom counts its Value. CROMWELL. I pity him; and wou'd the Commons think with me, He were as safe as Cromwell, and brave Fairfax, We will endeavour it; and may that Power, Whose Arm has fought the Battle of our Cause, Incline 'em all to think like you,—or me; [Aside. I will about it. Yet remember, Fairfax, The Posture of these Times: Consider too How great your Expectations ought to be: Wou'd Fairfax listen to the Voice of Cromwell, He shou'd have nearer Hopes than Charles's Life: Somewhat as great as your Desert shou'd crown you, And make you Partner of the highest Honours. [Exit. FAIRFAX. The highest Honours! What can Cromwell mean? Acquit me, Heav'n! I fought not but for Justice, Rage fir'd me not, nor did Ambition blind; No Party led me, and no Interest bound: My Tie was Conscience, and my Cause was Freedom. When Fairfax listens to another Call, May his next Stroke in Battle be his last. Enter IRETON. IRETON. Fairfax, I come commission'd by the Army To know your Pleasure, if you think it meet That they shou'd march and quarter nearer London: The publick Safety makes it requisite: But they attend your Orders ere they move. FAIRFAX. The publick Safety! Say what new Alarm, What Danger so awakes Security, That in her Fright, she thus lays hold of Caution? IRETON. The Safety of the Commons, of your self, Of the high Court of Justice; who to-morrow Against a Tyrant prove the People's Pow'r, And brings offending Majesty to Justice: This may excite his yet remaining Friends, Arm'd with Despair, to some Attempt of Danger. Who can be too secure? The Man whose Pillow Prevention guards, may sleep in Ease and Safety. FAIRFAX. To bring offending Majesty to Justice? IRETON. To the Scaffold. FAIRFAX. Ha! IRETON. Why do you start? FAIRFAX. Your Zeal too much transports you. Ireton, farewel,—and let me gain Belief, When I affirm this Moral to thy Ear: Conscience than Empire more Content can bring, And to be just, is to be more than King. [Exit. Enter CROMWELL. CROMWELL. It is enough, good Kinsman, let him go— And yet I cou'd well wish that he was ours— But 'tis no matter—You began to warm, And the good Cause sat burning on thy Cheek; Thou hast a well-turn'd Tongue: But list thee, Ireton, Hear my Design (for still my Heart is thine) The Commons most are ours: The Weeder's Care Has, from the Garden of our Enterprize, Thrown out the Rubbish that disgrac'd the Soil: And now our Growth looks timely. This you saw, When by my means a hundred doubted Members Were by the Army seiz'd upon their Entrance, And since expell'd the House. Independency Roots itself fast; while Presbytery Force Withers unseen. Wou'd Fairfax had been ours! IRETON. I cannot see that his Adherence to us Cou'd prosper much our Cause, or his Defection Make us decline one Moment from our Purpose. CROMWELL. You mistake, Ireton, Fairfax stands the first In Interest with the very Men I hate: Therefore his joint Endeavour wou'd be found The easiest Means to bring my Point to bear; Besides, he stands the fairest in the Love Of our whole Party. Were we link'd together, The Army too were ours; and their keen Swords Are powerful Arguments. We shall thrive however— I have it—He shall hence, and on an Expedition Not the most just; I know his squeamish Honour, If it surmise an Action the least tainted, Will throw up this Employment: Then 'tis mine: And while I have Dame Fortune, she shall please me. IRETON. But the main Turn of all your Enterprize Hangs on to Morrow, on the Death of Charles: 'Tis from his Scaffold only you must mount To what your Wishes aim at. CROMWELL. Fear not that. I have to do with Men, upon whose Tempers I know to work—Those who love Piety, I with the Vehemence of Prayer encounter, And thro' the Spirit practise on their Passions. Those who are crafty, I subdue with Fraud, And wile 'em to my Purpose. To the Bloody I promise Slaughters, Deaths and Executions: Gold gains the Covetous; and Praise the Proud. There is another sort—but they are easy; Your honest Men, who never wear Distrust: For Honesty's the Jaundice of the Mind, That makes us think our Neighbours like ourselves: Let us together. Ireton, here it lies; When Fools believe, wise Men are sure to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter FAIRFAX. O glory! how deceitful is thy View! Such are thy Charms, that o'er th'uncertain Way Of Vice or Faction, thou, to hide the Danger, Dost to the outward Eye shew fair Appearance: Which when the Follower steps on, down he sinks, And then too late looks backward to the Path Of long neglected Virtue. Enter Lady FAIRFAX. Lady FAIRFAX. My dearest Fairfax, call not this Intrusion; Long has Obedience combated with Love, Ere I wou'd press upon your Privacy: If Love has conquer'd, Love may be forgiven. The Faults of Tenderness (if Faults they are) E'en in offending wear the Seal of Pardon. Why are you thus alone? and why thus chang'd? FAIRFAX. My gentle Lady, Thoughts of deep Concern, That to the last Recesses of my Soul Travel, with Pain and Penitence their Guides, At length have found the Company they like; Busy Reflexion, moping Melancholy, And Silence the sure Guard that keeps the Door. Lady FAIRFAX. I cannot blame your Griefs; but come to share 'em. Indeed the Cause is just: But, good my Lord, Let not Despair take hold of that brave Heart, And boast a Conquest which your Foes ne'er cou'd. If (as I long have thought) the King be wrong'd, Seek to redress, and not lament his Fortunes. I am a Woman, not design'd for War, Yet cou'd this Hand (weak as you think its Grasp) Nerv'd by my Heart's Companion, Resolution, Display the Royal Banner in the Field, And shame the Strength of Manhood in this Cause. Forgive this Warmth: I ne'er 'till now, my Lord, Gave you unask'd my Thoughts, but I perceive Your Heart is wounded, and I came to heal it: To offer you the Balm of wholsom Counsel, And temper my Persuasion with my Love. FAIRFAX. Thou hast been more than I cou'd hope in Woman: Thy Beauty, thy least Excellence. Thou appear'st Like a fair Tree, the Glory of the Plain, The Root thy Honour, and the Trunk thy Friendship, (That stands the rudest Blast of cold Adversity) From whence branch out a thousand different Boughs; Candour, Humility, and Angel Truth, And every Leaf a Virtue. True, my Love, While I conceiv'd our Liberties in danger, I fought in their Defence; but cannot bear This bold Design upon the Life of Charles. We took up Arms to keep the Law entire, Not to defend its open Violation. Lady FAIRFAX. I know thy honest Heart, it hates a Wrong: 'Twas Principle, not Party, urg'd thee on To fight their Cause: But Cromwell's specious Wiles Pervert the Justice of thy fair Designs, And make thy Virtue pander to his Will. FAIRFAX. Cromwell has Art—but still I think him honest: Yet in our late Discourse his Speech, methought, Appear'd disjointed; and he wav'd the Theme I spoke about—The Safety of the King— At parting too, his Words betray'd a Purpose Beyond the Limits of a Commonwealth; And talk'd of highest Honours: But I hope That my Suspicions wrong him. Lady FAIRFAX. No, my Lord; Rather increase 'em; keep 'em still alive To arm against his black Designs: Discretion, At the Surmise of Danger, wakes incessant; Nor drops the Eye-lid 'till she sleeps in Safety. Enter a Servant. SERVANT. The Duke of Richmond and a Reverend Bishop Desire to see you. FAIRFAX. Wait upon them hither: I guess at their Desires, and wou'd to Heav'n My Pow'r cou'd grant 'em what my Wish confirms! Lady FAIRFAX. And wherefore not, my Lord? The Army yours, Who can dispute your Will? Command them hither, And be their Threats the Safety of the King. FAIRFAX. Betray my Trust! Thou canst not mean such Baseness. Shou'd I (which much I doubt, for Cromwell's Faction Equals my Pow'r, and more, among the Soldier) Make 'em revolt, what wou'd my Conscience say? 'Twou'd be a Mountain Crime, a Molehill Good. The Whiteness of my fair Design to Charles, Spread o'er the Visage of the Means that gave it; Like thinnest Lawn upon an Æthiop Face, Wou'd cover, not conceal the Blackness. No, my Love, Virtue and Baseness never meet together. Enter Bp. JUXON and D. of RICHMOND. JUXON. A mournful Errand, good my Lord of Fairfax, Makes us thus rude. My gentle Lady, stay;— Your Voice will help the Musick of our Plaint, And swell the Notes to moving Melody: Ill-fated Charles, deserted as he is, Lives in your fair Report (or Fame has err'd) Join in our Consort, as you are next his Heart, You know to touch the String that sounds to Pity. FAIRFAX. My Lords, I guess your Purpose, and assure you, If my Persuasion or my Wish avail, Charles feels no Stroke, 'till Nature gives the Blow. Long may the Fruit of Health adorn the Tree, And ripen with his Years in warmer Times! RICHMOND. 'Tis truly spoke, my Lord, and worthy Fairfax; Whom I have still consider'd in this Light; As nobly just, and but at worst misled. JUXON. How wou'd this Man adorn the Royal Cause, Who makes Rebellion wear the Face of Virtue? [Aside to Richm. How I am pleas'd to find you feel this Woe, And strive for its Prevention—Let these speak— [Weeps. These Eyes must else have known the dismal Office To see the Widow's and the Orphans Sorrows: Complaint had been my Language, Care, my Bed, And Contemplation my uneasy Pillow. Now by your Hopes of Mercy plead this Cause; Know it a Labour that will pay it self, E'en in this World—and when you mount above, You will behold it of so vast a Value, It will out-weigh th'Offences of your Life. FAIRFAX. Without this Intercession, good my Lord, I had done all within my feeble Pow'r; Yet think what Outcries din the Parliament, How many Zealots call aloud for Justice! Then think what you may hope, and what not fear. Lady FAIRFAX. No matter, Fairfax; 'tis a virtuous Cause, And Heav'n will bless the Purpose with Success. JUXON. There Mercy spoke, and in her softest Voice: ‘And Heaven, I doubt not, signs the Prophesy. Enter CROMWELL. CROMWELL. Indeed! Does Fairfax keep such Company? Shame on his pitying Heart! His Soul's unmann'd, His Resolution dwindled to a Girl's: Now, in the Name of Fight, is this the Man Whom Armies fled from, and whom Conquest lov'd? Behold him now crept to a private Corner, Counting out Tears with Priests and Women. [Aside. FAIRFAX. See Where Cromwell comes, I will once more assail him, And be your selves the Witness of his Answer. Good Cromwell, welcome! And let my Petition, Join'd with these Lords, prevail upon your Pity; Let Charles have Life? Is that so hard a Boon? In lieu of three fair Kingdoms, give him Life. CROMWELL. Why this Address to me? Am I the Parliament? 'Tis they who justly call him to account, And form this high Tribunal. JUXON. Justly, Cromwell. CROMWELL. Ay, good Bishop, justly! I cry you Mercy! By the good old Cause! It is but Gratitude in you to plead: Episcopacy was the Rock he split on; And he has ventur'd fairly for your Lawn: How learnedly did he uphold your Cause, When Henderson inveigh'd against your Miters, Did he not write full nobly? Say'st thou, Bishop?— JUXON. His Conscience prompted him to what he did; His Zeal for us can never be forgotten. CROMWELL. His Conscience! you say true- his Conscience did it: He wou'd have stretch'd to Arbitrary Sway, And swallow'd down our Liberties and Laws: His Conscience wou'd have soon digested them. FAIRFAX. Let us not into Insult turn our Pow'r; Good-fortune is not wedded to our Arms: Conquest, like a young Maiden with her Lover, If roughly treated, turns her Smiles to Frowns, And hates where once she lov'd. CROMWELL. I stand corrected. To me then you apply in Charles's Favour, And wait my Answer, which is briefly thus: I am but one, and (as the weaker must) Flow in the Current of Majority: My single Voice be it against, or for, Avails him little: If the rest incline To think of Mercy and of Charles together, 'Tis fairly done, and e'en to Cromwell's Wish: This is the Sum of all I can deliver— Fairfax, I have matter for your private Ear. JUXON. We humbly take our Leaves. FAIRFAX. My Lords, Farewel! [Exe. Jux. Rich. and Lady Fairfax. CROMWELL. How can you waste your time on Trash like this? Were Fairfax's Honour to be doubted, this might make The Child Suspicion grow to Certainty; But we are confident in you. Your Actions speak: Yet, Fairfax, do not let thy noble Eye Catch the Contagion of weak-judging Pity, And sympathize with Beggars. To my Purpose: The Council, at whose Head your Wisdom sits, Weighing some Depositions 'gainst the King, Wou'd have your Judgment's Sanction: They request Your Presence there; I bear their Will with Pleasure. FAIRFAX. It is not needed, Sir. As to the Purpose of their Meeting, say, If they incline to Mercy, let their Charge Be weaker than it is; but if to Rigour, They have, I fear, too much of that already: Let 'em (if friendly Fairfax may advise) Judge with that Candour, they expect of Heaven. CROMWELL. You will not go then? FAIRFAX. Say I cannot go. My Reason pleads against so bad a Deed, And Inclination holds me; nay, yet more, A secret Impulse strikes upon my Soul, Which, tho' I had the Will, wou'd yet detain me. CROMWELL. Folly and Superstition! Drive 'em hence; And in exchange, wear Honours and Renown: Of this I've said—And, noble Fairfax, believe me, That when the Wind of Promise and of Hope Stretches the Canvas out of Resolution, The Bark, Design, flies swift before the Gale, And quickly anchors in Good-fortune's Bay; Then we unlade our Freight of Doubts and Fears, And barter 'em for Happiness and Glory. [Exit. FAIRFAX. He who embarks himself in Cromwell's Ship, Out-sails fair Truth and ev'ry honest Purpose. 'Tis now too plain—How cou'd I doubt so long? My Honesty has made me Cromwell's Tool: His Arts have turn'd my Virtue to a Sword, And now 'tis bared against me. But say, shall Fairfax, who in open Field An Army cou'd not conquer, fall a Prey, To the ambitious Prospects of one Man? No, Fairfax, rouse up the Resentment's Force, And rescue thy Renown from Infamy. [Exit. SCENE, A Chamber. King CHARLES discover'd reading. KING. What art thou, Life, so dearly lov'd by all?— What are thy Charms, that thus the Great desire thee, And to retain thee part with Pomp and Titles? To buy thy Presence, the Gold-watching Miser Will pour his Bags of mouldy Treasure out, And grow at once a Prodigal. The Wretch Clad with Disease and Poverty's thin Coat, Yet holds thee fast, tho' painful Company. O Life! thou universal Wish; what art thou?— Thou'rt but a Day—a few uneasy Hours: Thy Morn is greeted by the Flocks and Herds, And every Bird that flatters with its Note, Salutes thy rising Sun; Thy Noon approaching, Then haste the Flies and every creeping Insect To bask in thy Meridian; that declining As quickly they depart, and leave thy Evening To mourn the absent Ray: Night at hand, Then croaks the Raven Conscience, Time mispent; The Owl Despair screams hideous, and the Bat Confusion flutters up and down— Life's but a lengthen'd Day not worth the waking for. Enter the QUEEN. My dearest Queen! I have been summing up th'Amount of Life, But found no Value in it, 'till you came. QUEEN. Do not perplex yourself with Thoughts like those: Ill Fortune at the worst, returns to better, At least we think so, as it grows familiar. KING. No, I was only arming for the worst. I have try'd the Temper of my inmost Soul, And find it ready now for all Encounters: Death cannot shake it. QUEEN. Do not talk of Death: The Apprehension shakes my tender Heart; Ages of Love, I hope, are yet to come, Ere that black Hour arrives: Such chilling Thoughts Disgrace the Lodging of that noble Breast. KING. What have I not to fear? Thus close confin'd; To-morrow forc'd to Trial. Will those Men, Who insolently drag me to the Bar, Stop in the middle of their Purpose? No. I must prepare for all Extremities: And (be that Pow'r ador'd, that lends me Comfort) I fell I am—Oh, do not weep, my Queen; Rather rejoice with me, to find my Thoughts Outstretch the painful Verge of humane Life, And have no Wish on Earth—but thee! 'tis there Indeed I feel: Peace and Resignation Had wander'd o'er the Rooms of ev'ry Thought, To shut Misfortune out, but left this Door Unclos'd, thro' which Calamity Has enter'd in thy Shape to seize my Heart. QUEEN. Be more yourself, my Lord; let Majesty Take root within thy Heart, nor meanly bend Before ill Fortune's Blast. KING. O doubt me not! 'Tis only on the Side where you are plac'd, That I can know a Fear. For Charles's self, Let fierce Encounter with the Sword of Danger Bring him to bloodiest Proof; and if he shrinks Despise him. Here, I glory in my Weakness. He is no Man whom Tenderness not melts, And Love so soft as thine. Let us go in. And if kind Heav'n designs me longer Stay On this frail Earth, I shall be only pleas'd, Because I have thy Presence here to crown me. But if it destines my immediate End; (Hard as it is, my Queen, to part with thee) I say, farewel, and to the Blow resign, That strikes me here—to make me more divine. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter CROMWELL and BRADSHAW. CROMWELL. It Shall be better, Bradshaw: Do not think Desert, tho' lowly plac'd, escapes our Eye; To me it is as precious in the Valley, As glittering on the Mountain's Top:— I praise my self that I have found thee out: 'Tis not my Favour, Bradshaw, but thy Worth Brings thee to light; thou dost not owe me aught. Now, Bradshaw, art thou our High-President. Thou hast a Heart well temper'd to the Cause: Thou look'st on Monarchy in a true Light: And where the Cause is just wilt shut out Pity. Pity! The Fool's Forgiveness and the Mother's Tear: The Indiscretion of th'unpractis'd Maid, Who thro' that Organ hears her Lover's Plaint, And listens to her Ruin. BRADSHAW. My good Sir; Think not of Bradshaw thus. My Souls firm; The melting Eye and the relenting Heart Ne'er wrong'd my Resolution. As to Kings, To Monarchy, and to superior State, That I disclaim'd; 'till your exalted Merit Alter'd my Purpose in my own Despite, And when I meant to level, rais'd you high. CROMWELL. Spoke in a hearty Zeal for our good Cause. That I have the same Thoughts of thee, let this, Thy present weighty Office, speak, which shou'd, If Cromwell's Nature bent to Partiality, Have fallen upon my Kinsman Ireton; One Of good Regard and hearty in the Service: But Cromwell's Heart points only to Desert, The North of all his Purpose. Thou art ours: And tho' thy Modesty at first declin'd To sit our Head, and lead our Counsels right, Yet I determin'd not to lose thy Worth, If Importunity cou'd win it. BRADSHAW. True, Sir; I own I thought my self unequal to it; Nor am I yet convinc'd: Yet what I want in Merit, I will make out in Rigour on the King, In Justice to the People and to Heaven. CROMWELL. Bradshaw, Thou art the very Sinew of our Cause; The Spirit of Design and Warmth of Zeal Glow in thy Purpose. I adore that Man, Who, once resolv'd, out-flies e'en Expedition. Thou art the Glory of our Brotherhood! And spare not to reproach, to taunt and blacken, T'insult their Party: Nay, the King himself: Mindful that all his Dignity is lost, And he, for monstrous Crime, brought forth to Justice. Seek an Occasion too, to talk with Fairfax, And urge to him the strong Necessity Of the King's Death—Perhaps he may prove angry— But do not thou regard it. The Time presses; And thou hast liv'd too long to squander that. BRADSHAW. Good Sir, farewel! my Love wou'd offer more, But my Haste wrongs it. [Exit. CROMWELL. Go too, Bradshaw. Such are the Tools with which the Wise must work: And yet he too is wise, and might cajole A Weaker than himself, and does. He is my proper Instrument To operate on those below my Notice. Thus by Comparison are all Things known; And by such under Steps as him, and lower, Do the Ambitious mount to Fame and Honour. Besides, I choose me those whom Zeal inflames, Who failing to convince you, will compel: Such, prompted by Enthusiasm's Force, And in Predestination's Armour cas'd, Will to the Mouth of Danger plant their Breasts, And out-fight Frenzy and Despair. But lo! Where Ireton comes! Enter IRETON. My trusty Friend, What Look wears our Design? IRETON. Such as a Bride, The Morning after Bliss, she smiles upon us, And laughs at what she fear'd. Petitions call For Justice on the King—Our Faction thrives; Murmur increases to a publick Outcry. All are 'gainst Charles, save a few pitying Hearts, Who melt with Fairfax and incline to Mercy. CROMWELL. 'Tis well; Send Post unto the Army, Ireton, And let those Sums of Money I have order'd, Be secretly dispers'd among the Soldiers; It will remind them of their Promises: Gold is Specifick for the Memory. O Gold! wer't not for thee, what great Design, What bold Ambition, that outstretches Justice, Cou'd have Success? Thou buy'st our very Prayers: Thou art the Heart of Opposition, And the Tooth of Faction. Wer't not for thy Aid, Success wou'd vary like the uncertain Wind, And Honesty might prosper! Hie thee, Ireton; I must to the King; I have some Bills to offer him, Which for the Life of Charles, Charles would not sign; And his Refusal turns to our Advantage. Thou shalt know more hereafter—Now dispatch. IRETON. Good Sir, I fly. [Exit. CROMWELL. Ha! who have we yonder? O! 'Tis the Wife of Fairfax: Once as hearty, As zealous for the Cause, as Cromwell's self, And wrought her Lord to think so. Now, O Woman! Such is thy varying Nature, that the Waves Are not more fluctuating than thy Opinions, Nor sooner are displac'd. To her is owing The wayward Pity of her Vassal Lord. Oh 'tis certain Danger to have such a Woman, Who, when Man leaves himself to toy with her, Knows how to win, and practise on his Weakness. But let me think—All Women may be won. The Dame of Ephesus, the Anne of Richard, Shew us a Woman's Grief and Resolution. Why may not she be wrought up to my Purpose, I can approach in what they like, in Flattery? Enter Lady FAIRFAX. Lady FAIRFAX. Stay, worthy Cromwell, and attend my Prayer, Hear me, and may thy Answer be propitious, As this kind Hour that favours my Address. O may my falling Tears that plead for Mercy, Drop on thy Heart, and melt it to Compliance, Nor disregard the Suit because a Woman's. Cromwell is noble; and the noble Soul Grants the most free Indulgence to the Weak, Because its generous Nature pleads their Cause. CROMWELL. Such is a Woman's Weakness, that she thinks T'impose on us, by what allures her self: But I must turn this Project upon her, And fairly put it to an equal Proof, Who best dissembles, Cromwell—or a Woman. [Aside. Lady, I must esteem a Compliment, When from a Tongue, that seldom errs that way. From what I know, and what I oft have heard, You can dress Praise like Truth: That Praise I mean, Which from our liking to the Theme we speak of, Swells to Extravagance, (tho' still our Thoughts) Such Warmth is Virtue's Fault; and such, I hope, May be your kind Excuse for praising me. Lady FAIRFAX. Talk not of Praise, good Sir, your Merit shames it, When from a Woman's Mouth. CROMWELL. Well turn'd again. [Aside. O Lady, were I but to speak my Thoughts Of you, and your brave Lord, you wou'd conclude 'Twere Praise indeed—for Virtue looks within For her Faults only, not for her Perfections. Hear some of those: You once espous'd our Cause, E'en with Persuasion's Warmth; and well you su'd. We have not, sure, o'erlook'd Desert so far To merit Opposition? The State is busy—but the Time will come When her best Office shall be pleasing you. Lady FAIRFAX. You mock me, Sir; I do not wish that Time, Vain as you think my Sex. I came to say— CROMWELL. E'en to that purpose, to the Life of Charles. It cannot be, the People cry for Justice: Wou'd I cou'd stop its Course! But, gentle Lady! Think it more wise to fly a falling Pile, Than strive to prop its Ruin. Charles must die. Lady FAIRFAX. O gracious Cromwell!— CROMWELL. Nay, but hear me on. Why will you thus employ your Eloquence, Which our whole Council wou'd with liking hear, To help Impossibilities? Goody Lady, Rather employ it (and you know the way) To teach your Lord to value rising Fortune, And make his Fame— Lady FAIRFAX. As black as yours will be. Shame on thy dark Designs, and the whole Cause, If only such a Deed can make it prosper. Be the Heart bloodless that conceives the Act, The Tongue accurst that dares avow the Purpose, And the Hand blasted that obeys the Order! May his Life here be all the Hell we think of, Yet find a greater in the other World. [Exit. CROMWELL. How wayward and perverse a thing is Woman! How much unlike the Softness we expect, When Rage and Trifles vex 'em: In the Heat And the full Vigour of their first Enjoyment, Distrust succeeds their Love; and he who pleases, Is hunted by their Jealousy to Hate.— Fairfax and Bradshaw earnest in Dispute: I will not interrupt them, but to Charles. [Exit. Enter FAIRFAX and BRADSHAW. BRADSHAW. Why all this Heat, my Lord; because I said That Charles deserves to die? Why, I repeat it; And wou'd you master this unmanly Rage, I might to Reason prove it, but not Frenzy. FAIRFAX. Well, I am calm—Speak out your bloody Purpose, What Hell devises, and what Bradshaw thinks. BRADSHAW. Cast your Eye backward then, and let us view E'en the beginning of this Charles's Reign; In the first Year a raging Plague destroy'd us, And was prophetick of our Woes to come: Did it not sweep whole Multitudes away Fast as the Sword? which Charles has since unsheath'd. ‘Did he not follow still his Father's Steps, ‘Retain his Ministry, pursue his Aims? ‘Wou'd he, tho' pray'd and threaten'd by the Parliament, ‘Give up those Men, whose Counsels had misled him? ‘And is not that Prince weak—to say no more— ‘Who from a general Outcry guards the Man, ‘Whose bold Ambition strikes at Liberty, ‘At native Freedom, and the Subjects Right? FAIRFAX. You but this Moment blam'd my Warmth, And art thy self transported. BRADSHAW. Grant I be: 'Tis in the Cause that Liberty approves, And every honest Englishman must own it: But to proceed—Those Men he still held fast, Or parted with 'em, as the Heart drops Blood: ‘Witness the Earl of Strafford: Tax'd the Land By grievious Impositions; levy'd War Against the Commons, and the Kingdom's Peace. But I forget me that I speak to Fairfax, Who has so often fought against his Arms, And taught Success to know the Cause of Right. FAIRFAX. I fought for Reparation of our Wrongs— But cannot think that it consists in Murder. I wou'd not have him die. BRADSHAW. By the good Cause, It does portend some more than common Change, When Generals plead for Mercy! Shame it hence, And let your Visage wear the Glow of Rage; Let Prynn's undaunted Soul inform thy Breast, And drive weak Pity thence. FAIRFAX. I'll hear no more: Thy servile Tongue may spare its hireling Office, It roots my Purpose firmer: In thy Speech, I read Design, tho' Oratory's Flowers Strive to conceal the Rancour of the Heart. O Eloquence! thou violated Fair, How art thou woo'd, and won to either Bed, Of Right or Wrong! O when Injustice folds thee, Dost thou not curse thy Charms for pleasing him, And blush at Conquest? But the Juncture calls, Nor will I leave one Moment unemploy'd, Till the King's Safety be confirm'd. [Exit. BRADSHAW. 'Tis well. I must to other Folk, here time is lost. This Man has step'd into the Stream of Mischief, Just like the Boy, who tries the Waters cold, And shrinking pulls his Foot to Land: Men, like me, Plunge boldly in, and weather to their Point. SCENE changes to the King's Apartment. Enter KING and Bishop JUXON. JUXON. Why does your Highness seem so lost in Thought? Consider not so deeply, good my Lord. KING. The Purport of my Dream this Afternoon, Has set this Visage on. I'll tell thee, Juxon— Finding my Spirits faint, I laid me down, And courted Sleep to ease me; to my Wish It quickly seiz'd my Eye-lids, and methought, (So Fancy painted) former Times return'd Grandeur encircled me, and regal State; My People's Love flew round about my Throne, On Acclamation's Wing; 'twas Glory all, And such a Reign as Charles has pray'd for: Homage, The Bond of Friendship, and the Oath of Trust, Were all before me: Straight the pleasing Scene, Quick as the fearful Eye can wink, was chang'd; And in its Room, a vast and dreary Plain, Comfortless, wild, without Inhabitant, Stretch'd out a dismal length that tir'd the Eye; I was about to go,—when kind Adversity Pull'd me behind, and as I turn'd around, Shew'd me where Innocence stood weeping by; He whisper'd in my Ear, that she alone Of all my boasting Friends had staid with me. The Thought struck deep, I wak'd, and good my Lord, I found my weeping Queen within my Arms. Enter CROMWELL. CROMWELL. If I disturb you, Sir, I ask your Pardon: Necessity will sometimes be importunate, And out-go Compliment. KING. Your Business, Sir? CROMWELL. Know then, whatever may be thought of Cromwell, He pays this Visit to approve his Love, His fair Design and Honesty of Heart To Charles—Solicitous to bring you good. Behold two Bills, in Tenor much the same With those before presented; I presume, The Eye in Danger more distinctly sees, Freed from Security's thick Film: These sign'd, Rigour may break her Sword, and Concord join us. KING. Can the low Peasant mount his Thoughts with Kings? The servile Judge of all Men by themselves. But know, mistaken Man, the noble Mind Rises above Distress; and Terms, perhaps, Which in the Day of Power I might accept, Must be refus'd in this: But these can never. There is no Good that equals the Exchange Of peaceful Thoughts and an untainted Mind. CROMWELL. Where were those Thoughts in Charles's former Days? When to despotick Sway you stretch'd your View, And wou'd have pull'd up Laws! When to that End You so caress'd your Fav'rite Buckingham The Tool of your Designs. What were your Thoughts? When from the fair Impeachment of the Publick, You shelter'd up that Monster Minister, And hid him in the Bosom of your Fondness? JUXON. Insolent Cromwell! Know to whom thou speak'st, Think what a Distance Heav'n has set between you, And be your Words as humble as your State. CROMWELL. Distance! good Bishop! But I cry you Mercy! ‘For thus the Clergy will still argue on, ‘Deny from Pique, assert from Prejudice; ‘Shew us the Lesson, seldom the Example, ‘And preach up Laws which they will ne'er obey: But thou art Trash below the Note of Cromwell: To thee I speak Protector of black Buckingham, ‘What must that Monarch be, who lets one Man ‘Ingross the Offices of Place and Pow'r, ‘Who with the purloin'd Money of the State ‘Buys Popularity, and whose careless Eye ‘Sees our fair Trade destroy'd by Corsair Force, ‘And Pirate Violence: Who merchandises Trusts, ‘And highest Posts—and whose unbounded Pow'r ‘Does on his worthless Kindred lavish Titles. KING. Were I the Person that thy Malice speaks, I shou'd deserve this Treatment. Thy base Charge Strikes at my Honesty as King and Man, And forces me to answer. Well I know, That for my Actions here, to Heav'n alone I stand accountable; yet stooping thus, (Low as to thee) I thus avow my Justice; Have I not still maintain'd the Subjects Rights, Preserv'd Religion pure; nay, struggl'd for it, E'en to this Hour, the Witness of thy Insolence? What wou'd your Faction have? If Monarchy; Must I not govern by the Acts of State? I am a Monarch else without a Council. Wou'd you reduce the State to Anarchy? You are a Council then without a Pow'r. CROMWELL. You feel our Pow'r ('as slightly as you term it) KING. Such as a Robber's, by Surprize and Force: Where is your Right from Heav'n? CROMWELL. Power! The Right of Nature and the free-born Man. KING. Leave me. CROMWELL. You speak as if you still were King. KING. If not: What am I then? CROMWELL. Charles Stuart, nothing more. KING. Well may the servile Herd insult and threaten, When they behold the Lion in the Toils. CROMWELL. You may complain as much as suits your Will, You've still that Comfort left—So fare you well. [Exit. JUXON. Thus is good Fortune treated by the Base: O did she know how much they shame her Favours, She wou'd confer 'em only on the Great! Be chearful, Sir; he is not worth a Thought. KING. O Juxon! think what Majesty must feel, Who bears an Insult from a subject Tongue: But let him hence—I am compos'd again, And for the worst prepar'd. All gracious Heav'n! You gave me Power and you may take it back; You gave me Life, and may reclaim the Gift; That as you please—But spare this luckless Land, And save it from Misfortune's rugged Hand! My ev'ry Wish is for its Joys Increase, And my last Pray'r shall be my Peoples Peace. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter King CHALES, the QUEEN and Lady FAIRFAX. QUEEN. Is it like Love thus to persuade me hence? Is it like Love, alas! in me to go? Can she be faithful to her luckless Lord, Who will be absent in Affliction's Hour? Is it not then the lenient Hand of Love Proves its best Office? Then the virtuous Wife Shines in the full Meridian of her Truth, And claims her Part of Sorrow: Oh, my Lord, Have I been so unthrifty of thy Joy, That you deny me to partake your Woe? KING. No, my best Queen—You wrong my Heart's Design. 'Tis not my Wish advises—but my Fear, My Fears for thee, the tenderest Part of Charles; When thou art safe beyond their barbarous Pow'r, I cannot feel Misfortune. QUEEN. But I shall, More than to share e'en Death with thee:— My Sorrows will be doubted if I go:— The Pangs of Separation must be great, And my Conceit of what my Charles may feel Exceed Reality—O let me stay— I was prepared to suffer all Things with you, But not the Shock of Parting. Lady FAIRFAX. Welcome Tears! Who that have Virtue can behold this Scene? And not be Actors in it? KING. Now 'tis past, I wou'd have sooner spoke, but pow'rful Nature First claim'd my Tears, ere she wou'd lend me Words: It must not be, my Love, thy Pray'r to stay (The growing Proof of thy eternal Love) Argues against thee to my tender Heart, And forces thee away: This worthy Lady Has found the Means, and made the generous Offer, Her Care prepares your Flight: The present Hour That forces me before their black Tribunal, Will hold all Eyes regardless of your Steps, And make Security thy Guide:—Farewel, Till we shall meet again, thy dear Idea Shall in my waking Fancy still revive; And fill up every Dream. QUEEN. My dearest Lord, Can you so easily pronounce—Farewel, When that Farewel may be perhaps—for ever? O can you leave me thus?— Methinks our Parting shou'd affect the World, And Nature sympathize with Griefs like ours— O let me stay, at least, till this black Day Be past, that I may know the worst. To be in doubt is worse than to be certain; My Apprehension will increase my Woe, And bring the blackest Scenes of Death before me. KING. No more, my Queen! that were to risk thy Safety, And make me more unhappy in thy Danger: Farewel. QUEEN. O, yet a little longer! Each Moment now is worth an Age before; Thou never resting Time! 'tis only now I count thy Value: O, my dearest Lord! Who cou'd believe when first we met in Love, That we shou'd know a Parting worse than Death? Do not go yet. KING. Heav'n knows I wou'd not go— But dire Necessity must be obey'd: And see where he appears in his worst Form. Keep in thy Tears, my Love, lest he suspect— And teach thy Heart to say Farewel at once. Enter Col. TOMLINSON. TOMLINSON. My Lord, I have Orders to attend your Majesty To Westminster. KING. A Moment spent in private, And I am ready: Do not droop, my Queen, [Exit Tom. Exert the strongest Vigour of thy Soul, Call up thy Piety, thy awful Virtue, Thy Resolution, and thy Sex's Pride, And take their friendly Counsel; they will soon Determine you to think of Charles, as one Beyond the Power of Faction in this World, And ready for another—Fare thee well, I have this Compliment to pay thy Worth, That I now leave thee with more tender Thoughts Than first I met thy Love—this Tear—adieu. Now, Sir, lead on. [To C. Tom. entring. QUEEN. O stay, my dearest Lord! [Exe. King and C. Tom. Let me assure thee of my Faith and Love— Witness thou awful Ruler of the World, How much I feel in Parting—how my Heart Labours to break to prove its Constancy; How my Affection still has call'd thee Dear; Never unkind, 'till in this parting Moment, What do I say! Alas, my Charles is gone— Fancy presented him before my Eyes, And my Tears wrong'd my Sight—he's gone for ever. Lady FAIRFAX. Good Madam, think your Safety calls upon you, Your very Sorrows are not here secure; Tho' you neglect your own, yet think his Ease, The Ease of Charles, depends upon your Flight; I have provided every proper Means, They wait your Will.— QUEEN. Kind Lady, I will go— But oh, be just to Nature, and to Pity, And own 'tis hard—I thank your friendly Tears, They speak my Meaning—but I weary you.— The Wretch who feels Misfortunes will complain, And I have wondrous Reason—O my Charles! Since I must go, may every adverse Star Dart on my wandring Head, and leave thy Sky Deck'd with propitious Planets only.—May thy Life, Clear as thy Innocence, adorn the World, And be the Theme of Wonder—O my Heart! [Exeunt. Enter the Marquiss of LINDSEY, meeting the Duke of RICHMOND. LINDSEY. Saw you the King pass by? RICHMOND. I did, my Lord: As to his Coronation, not his Trial: Such was his Look—such awful Majesty Beam'd out on every Side, and struck the Gazer. No Mark of Sorrow furrow'd up his Face, Nor stopp'd his Smiles to his saluting Friends; Clear as his Conscience, was his Visage seen, The Emblem of his Heart. As I approach'd, Richmond, said he, commend me to my Friends; Say, tho' my Pow'r is gone, my Wishes reach 'em, And ev'ry Pray'r that rises, breathes their Welfare. 'Tis not in Faction to subdue the Spirit, Or break the noble Mind: His speaking Eyes Repeated his Commands, and pierc'd my Heart; E'en the base Rabble—licens'd to insult, Struck with the Dignity of Kingly Awe, Forgot their Hire, and rose from Praise to Wonder. LINDSEY. Will you not follow, Sir? 'twere worth Remark, How he deports himself. RICHMOND. O fear not Charles, Let him encounter with an Host of Kings, And he shall stand the Shock without a Terror: Will he then shrink beneath a Subject-Brow, Tho' wrinkled with Rebellion?—no, good Lindsey, The Lion cannot lose his Kingly Nature, The Sun its Heat, nor Charles his noble Firmness; Perhaps indeed, his generous Heart may feel, Not for himself, but for his Tyrant Judges; He may lament deprav'd Humanity, And blush to be mistaken in his People. See, what a mournful Visage Fairfax wears, The Sun of Pleasantry eclips'd by Thought: Now Judgment combates Inadvertency, And makes him curse Success—but thus 'tis ever When Courage wildly starts out by it self, Nor asks Consideration's friendly Aid; Confusion joins him; then he wanders thro' The Thicket, Doubt, the Maze, Perplexity, And finds at last Repentance. Enter FAIRFAX. FAIRFAX. Now the Scene of bloodiest Purpose is on foot, and acting; Now Murder mounts the Bench, array'd like Justice, And points the Sword at Charles—ill-fated Man! Ha! who are those? The Friends of Cromwell's Faction? No, they are with their Huntsmen on the Scent Of Royal Blood, uncoupled for Destruction:— If Sorrow blinds me not—the Duke of Richmond. RICHMOND. Good Sir, how fare you? FAIRFAX. Wondrous ill, My Lord. Cou'd I but tell you what I feel,—yet live, You wou'd conclude me Danger-proof—O Sir! Reflexion shews me the vast Tract I've past, And stern Impossibility denies One Step Return—yet (be my Witness Heav'n) This dreadful Day was never in my Wish. RICHMOND. We do not think it was—but, gentle Lord! Think of some Means to ward this fatal Blow, And save the King. Wou'd you but go, my Lord, Your Struggle might— FAIRFAX. Alas! what can I do? Was ever Army routed by one Man? I have an Army there to combate with:— Shou'd I go there in order for Prevention, Failing, my Presence wou'd be made Consent, And I still more unhappy: O the Change! This is the Curse of Independent Pow'r, For Presbytery never meant it? Yet, my Lords, You shall not say, that Fairfax only talks, He will approve his Honesty by Deeds; Somewhat he will attempt to save his Honour, And clear it to the View of future Times. RICHMOND. We do not doubt your Will nor yet your Power; My Lord, Farewel— [Exe. Richm. and Lind. FAIRFAX. My Pow'r—say, what is Pow'r? The vain Extent of Title and of Land; The barbarous Impulse to the insulting Wretch, To use his Fellow-Creature like a Slave; The Woman's Idol, and the Man's Misfortune, As it too often robs him of Humanity. This is the worst Degree—behold the best, And now 'tis lovely; the Redress of Wrongs, Hunger's Repast, and the large Draught of Thirst, The poor Man's Riches, and the rich Man's Wealth, When thus apply'd—The Means to stop the Death, The Death of Charles—This is my Wish for Pow'r. [Exit. SCENE draws and discovers the High-Court. KING, BRADSHAW, CROMWELL, IRETON, &amp;c. KING. Sir, were my Person all the Danger here, I shou'd not think it worth the Pain of Speech; Your Charge 'gainst me is of the smallest Force, But 'tis my People's Liberties I prize, At which, thro' me you strike: Impeachments run In the King's Name, and therefore cannot lie Against the King himself; what earthly Pow'r Can justly call me to account? By what Law Have you erected this pretended Court?— The House of Commons?—Say, is that alone A Court of Judicature? Where are the Lords To lend their Aid? The King to sit supreme, And pass the Nation's Laws? Are these your Means To bring the King to meet his Parliament? To force him hither like a Criminal? I lately did require and press'd it warmly, Stoop'd, almost to Intreaty, to be heard Before both Houses in the Painted-Chamber; I told you, what I had to offer there, Concern'd the Kingdom's Safety more than mine: I was refus'd—Is this your boasted Justice? Consider of it yet—and hear your King; If you do not, remember where it lies, The Weight of this Day's Guilt; if you refuse, Do as you please—I have no more to say. BRADSHAW. The Court has something then to say to you, Which, tho' it may not please you, must be spoke: You have been charg'd with Tyranny and Murder, With levying Arms against the Commonwealth, And joining in Rebellion 'gainst the People. KING. Sir, give me Leave to speak ere Sentence passes Against those Imputations— BRADSHAW. By your favour, Your time is past, and Sentence now approaching. KING. Am I not to be heard? BRADSHAW. 'Tis now too late; You have disown'd us for a Court of Justice; We have too long been trifled with already; And must proceed—Attend your Sentence, Sir: The Commons, in behalf of the whole People, Have constituted this High-Court of Justice, To try Charles Stuart lately King of England. He has thrice heard his Charge, and thrice deny'd The Pow'r and Jurisdiction of the Court, For which Contempt, and Proof of his High Crimes, It does pronounce him Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, Adjudging him to Death, by severing His Head and Body—This is the joint Act, The Sentence, Judgment, and the Resolution Of the whole Court. [The whole Court rises in token of their Assent. KING. Will you hear me, Sir? BRADSHAW. Not after Sentence. KING. No, Sir? BRADSHAW. It is too late. Withdraw your Prisoner. KING. ‘May I not speak—? I may, Sir, after Sentence. ‘Your favour, Sir, I may, Sir, after Sentence. BRADSHAW. ‘Adjourn the Court. [The King is brought forward; the Scene closes. KING. Deny'd to speak—Why have I liv'd to this? When I had Power, the meanest of my Subjects, Not heard by me, wou'd straight arraign my Justice, And brand me with the hated Name of Tyrant. Will future Ages, looking back to this, Credit the Record? They will rather deem it The black Invective of a partial Pen, And curse his Mem'ry that libell'd England. Sir, I am ready to atend your Will, Do your worst Office; if 'tis your Commission, Then lead me now this Instant to the Block; 'Twill be a joyful Hearing, for believe me I wou'd not live in longer Fellowship With Men, whom my best Thoughts must call ungrateful. TOMLINSON. Sir, my Commands are to attend you back; I have no more in charge. KING. I follow you. [As he goes out, Fairfax enters. FAIRFAX. Sir, let me trespass for a Word or two, Ere you remove your Prisoner. To Tomlinson. TOMLINSON. I obey, Sir. KING. Your Pleasure, Sir! If you come here t'insult, Spare not the Taunt, nor the opprobrious Smile, I have to-day already born so much, That an Addition will be scarcely felt. FAIRFAX. Wrong me not so; I bear a fairer Purpose: My Heart, detesting this accursed Day, Comes to approve its Honesty to Charles: If I have often fought against thy Arms, My Conscience dictated, and not my Hate; Acquit me to thy self of this last Act, And judge the former as you please. KING. Good Fairfax, The present Times are liable to Error, I am a fatal Instance; then forgive me. I had forgot how lately I had Cause To think you now no Enemy to Charles; But Sorrow forc'd down her lethargick Draught, Which had clos'd up the Eye of Memory. FAIRFAX. Ill-fated Prince! how does thy Firmness shine, And make Affliction glorious: O 'tis thus, The truly Great exert their Resolution, And make Calamity a Virtue: Cromwell now Loses the barb'rous Joy of his Design, To see Misfortune's Arrow fail to pierce thee. KING. Believe me, Fairfax, 'tis not innate Firmness, The Dame Morality, the Stoick Patience, That furnish true Serenity of Mind: I had try'd all these Helps, but prov'd 'em weak, And found the best Philosophy in Virtue: Can the fond Teacher's Lesson, conn'd by Rote, Change the dark Lodging of the Murderer's Breast, To the Sun-lighted Rooms of Innocence? O, no! As to the Agents of my present Fate, I look upon 'em with the Eye of Thanks; Who from this Life of Sorrow wing my Parting, And send me sooner to an happier Throne. FAIRFAX. Such Resignation wears the noble Mind, And triumphs over Death: But, gentle Charles! Think not of Death so soon, live long and happy: Fairfax will try his utmost Stretch of Power, But you shall live, tho' this black Day has happen'd; Persuasion, Pray'r and Force shall all be us'd To make my Promise good. KING. Good Fairfax, hear me; Nor indiscreetly throw thy self away, To save the Man whose Wishes are to die. I had remov'd my Thoughts from Earth, and now 'Twill be such Pain to call 'em back again— Life is not worth the Trouble: Yet I thank thee. FAIRFAX. This was but half my Purpose: Hear me on— If in the Hurry of intemp'rate Zeal, I have outgone the Justice of the Cause, And, erring in my Judgment, fought in wrong, Let this Intreaty win thee to a Pardon. KING. If to have my Forgiveness, makes thee clear, Thou art as white as Virtue. FAIRFAX. Glorious Charles! But I will hasten to preserve his Life, And make my Gratitude, my Thanks; Farewel! It is the common Interest of Mankind To let him live, to shine out an Example. KING. Who dresses in good Fortune's gorgeous Ermine, Looks not so comely to a virtuous Eye, As he who clothes him in repentant Black: I tire your Patience: Come, Sir, lead the way; Lighter than Fancy does my Bosom feel, My Thoughts are Mercy, and my quiet Conscience Tranquillity's still calm; no anxious Fear Beats in in my Pulse, or ruffles me with Care: If the bare Hope of Immortality Knows Peace like this, what must the full Enjoyments be. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. FAIRFAX solus. Why did I conquer—to repent of Conquest? Who, tho' I fought for Liberty alone, Will yet acquit me of the Guilt that follows? Will future Ages, when they read my Page, (Tho' Charles himself absolves me of the Deed) Spare me the Name of Regicide? O no! I shall be blacken'd with my Party's Crimes, And damn'd with my full Share, tho' innocent: In vain then 'gainst Oppression have I warr'd, In vain for Liberty uprear'd the Sword; Posterity's black Curse shall brand my Name, And make me live in Infamy for ever. Now, Valour, break thy Sword, thy Standard, Victory, Furl up thy Ensigns, bold Hostility, And sink into Inaction: Since, alas! One tainted Heart, or one ambitious Brain Can turn the Current of the noblest Purpose, And spoil the Trophies of an Age's War. But see where, to my Wish, stern Cromwell comes; Now urge him strongly for the Life of Charles, And, if Intreaty fails, avow thy Purpose. Enter CROMWELL. CROMWELL. Fairfax in Thought? My noble Lord, good Day. FAIRFAX. To make it good, let Cromwell grant my Pray'r, So Mercy and the Sun shall shine together. CROMWELL. Still on this paltry Subject? Fairfax, why, Why will you wrong Intreaty by this Cause? Fairfax is wise, and should not ask of Cromwell To grant what Justice stops; yours are not Years, When Childhood prattles, or when Dotage mopes:— Pardon the Expression. FAIRFAX. I forgive you all, All you can think, but Rigour to the King. CROMWELL. Pr'ythee no more: This Mercy that you pray for, As ill becomes the Tongue, as my Severity; Nay worse; would you obstruct the Law In its due Office? Nor permit the Ax To fall upon Offenders, such as Charles? Wou'd you see Tyranny again arise, And spread in its Foundation? Let us then Seize on our General, Liberty, who still Has in the Front of Battle fought our Cause, And led us on to Conquest; let us bind him In the strong Chains of rough Prerogative, And throw him helpless at the Feet of Charles: He will absolve us then, and praise our Folly. FAIRFAX. This is a Sophistry too weak for Reason: You wou'd excuse the Guilt of Charles's Death, By shewing me the opposite Extreme; But can you find no Mean, no middle Course, Steering between the Danger of the last, And Horror of the first? I know you can. CROMWELL. It is not to be done: Wou'd Fairfax now, When he has labour'd up the steep Ascent, And wasted Time and Spirits; would he now, When but one Step exalts him to the Summit, Where to his Eye the fair Horizon stretches, And ev'ry Prospect Greatness can command; Would he now stop, let go his fearful Hold, And tumble from the Height? FAIRFAX. I aim at none; Damn'd be all Greatness that depraves the Heart, Or calls one Blush from Honesty—no more, I shall grow warm to be thus trifled with: Think better, Cromwell—I have given my Promise That Charles shall live. CROMWELL. A Promise may be broke, Nay start not at it—'Tis an hourly Practice; The Trader breaks it, yet is counted honest, The Courtier keeps it not—yet keeps his Honour; Husband and Wife in Marriage promise much, Yet follow sep'rate Pleasures, and are—virtuous. The Churchmen promise too, but wisely, they To a long Payment stretch the crafty Bill, And draw upon Futurity: A Promise! 'Tis the wise Man's Freedom, and the Fool's Restraint, ‘It is the Ship in which the Knave embarks, ‘Who rigs it with the Tackle of his Conscience, ‘And sails with ev'ry Wind: Regard it not. FAIRFAX. Can Cromwell think so basely as he speaks? It is impossible, he does but try How well fair Speech becomes a vicious Cause, But, I hope, scorns it in the richest Dress. Yet hear me on, it is our Interest speaks, And bids us spare his Life; while that continues, No other Title can annoy our Cause, And him we have secure; but grant him dead, Another Claim starts up, another King, Out of our reach—this bloody Deed perhaps May rouse the Princes of the Continent, (Who think their Persons struck at in this Blow) To shake the very Safety of our Case. CROMWELL. When you consult our Int'rest, speak with Freedom, It is the Turn and Point of all Design: But take this Answer, Fairfax, in return; Britain, the Queen of Isles, our fair Possession Secur'd by Nature, laughs at foreign Force; Her Ships her Bulwark, and the Sea her Dike, Sees Plenty in her Lap, and braves the World; Be therefore satisfy'd, for Charles must die. FAIRFAX. Wilt thou be heard, tho' at thy utmost Need, Who now art deaf to Mercy and to Pray'r? O curst Ambition—thou devouring Bird, How dost thou from the Field of Honesty, Pick ev'ry Grain of Profit and Delight, And mock the Reaper, Virtue! Bloody Man! Know that I still have Pow'r, have still the Means, To make that certain, which I stoop to ask; And fix my self against thy black Design, And tell thee, dauntless, that he shall not die. CROMWELL. Will Fairfax turn a Rebel to the Cause, And shame his Glories? FAIRFAX. I abjure the Name, I know no Rebel on the Side of Virtue. This I am sure of; He that acts unjustly Is the worst Rebel to himself, and tho' now Ambition's Trumpet and the Drum of Pow'r May drown the Sound, yet Conscience will, one Day, Speak loudly to him, and repeat that Name. CROMWELL. You talk as 'twere a Murder, not a Justice; Have we not brought him to an open Trial? Does not the general Cry pronounce his Death? Come, Fairfax dares not. FAIRFAX. By yon Heav'n I will:— I know thee resolute, but so is Fairfax. You see my Purpose, and shall find I dare— [going. CROMWELL. Fairfax, yet stay; I would extend my Pow'r To its full Stretch, to satisfy your Wish; Yet wou'd not have you think that I shou'd grant That to your Threats, which I deny'd your Pray'r:— Judge not so meanly of your self and me: Be calm, and hear me—What is human Nature, When the intemperate Heat of Passion blinds The Eye of Reason, and commits her Guidance To headlong Rashness; he directs her Steps Wide of Success, to Error's pathless Way, And Disappointments wild; Yet such we are, So frail our Being, that our Judgment reaches Scarce farther than our Sight—Let us retire, And in this great Affair intreat his Aid, Who only can direct to Certainty. There is I know not what, of good presage, That dawns within, and lights to happy Issue. FAIRFAX. If Heav'n and you consider it alike, It must be happy. CROMWELL. An Hour or two of Pray'r Will pull down Favour upon Charles and us. FAIRFAX. I am contented, but am still resolv'd That Charles shall live—I shall expect your Answer With the Impatience of desiring Lovers, Who swell a Moment's Absence to an Age. [Exit. CROMWELL. This was a Danger quite beyond my View, Which only this Expedient cou'd prevent; Fairfax is weak in Judgment, but so brave, That set Determination by his Side, And he ascends the Mountain Top of Peril; Now Time is gain'd to ward against his Pow'r, Which quickly must be thought on—To my Wish— Enter IRETON. IRETON. I but this Instant met the General, Fairfax, Who told me his Intreaty had prevail'd To save the Life of Charles: 'Tis more than Wonder— CROMWELL. Ireton, thy Presence never was more timely; I would disclose—but now each Moment's Loss, Is more than the Neglect of future Years: Hie thee in Person to St. James's, Ireton, And warn the Officer, whose Charge leads forth The King to Execution, to be sudden, Let him be more than punctual to the Time; If his Respect to us forerun his Warrant, It shall win Greatness for him; so inform him— That done repair oth' Instant to the Army, And see a chosen Party march directly, (Such as can well be trusted) post them, Ireton, Around the Scaffold; my best Kinsman, fly. [Exit Ireton. Why now, I think, I have secur'd my Point, I set out in the Current of the Tide, And not one Wind that blows around the Compass, But drives me to Success: Ambition now Soars to its darling Height, and Eagle like Looks at the Sun of Pow'r, enjoys its Blaze, And grows familiar with the Brightness; now I see Dominion nigh; Superiority Beckons and points me to the Chair of State; There, Grandeur robes me: Now let Cromwell boast, That he has reft the Crown from Charles's Brow, To make it blaze more awful on his own. [Exit. SCENE, The King discover'd on a Couch. Kind Sleep, farewel! Thou hast been loyal in the nightly Care, And always smooth'd my Pillow; at our Parting, As to a faithful Friend, I say Farewel, And thank thee for thy Service: Here's another, Enter Bp. JUXON. Whose better Care brings Quiet to the Mind: Who gives the rich Opiate of Content, That makes us sleep in Hope, and wake to Mercy; Him too, the Bankrupt Charles can only pay, As he has done the former, no Return, But the poor Gratitude of Thanks, warm from the Heart. Say, my good Lord, have you so soften'd Rigour, That I may see my Children ere I die? JUXON. It is permitted, Sir, they wait without: I would not let them enter, 'till I knew You were prepar'd, and ready for the Interview. [Exit Juxon. KING. Good Juxon, lead them hither. Now the Father, Spite of my Firmness, steals into my Eye, And melts my Manhood; Heart! thou hast no Temper Proof against Nature, speaking in a Child. Enter Bp. JUXON, JAMES, GLO'STER, and ELIZABETH. JAMES. My Royal Father! KING. Good Juxon, make them rise, For if I look that Way I shall kneel too, And join with them in Tears; A Chair, good Juxon. [Juxon brings a Chair forward, and raises the Children. Come hither, James; nay, do not weep, my Boy, Keep thy Eyes bright to look on better Times. JAMES. I will command my Nature if I can, And stop these Tears of Sorrow, for indeed They drown my Sight; and I would view thee well; Copy my Royal Father in his Death, And be the Son of his heroic Virtues KING. Thou art the Child of Duty; hear me, James, And lay up this last Lesson in thy Heart; When I am dead, look on thy Brother Charles, Not as thy Brother only, but thy King; Pay him Fraternal Love and Subject Duty; Nor let Ambition, or the Thirst to reign, Poison thy firm Allegiance: When thou seest him, Bear him my Blessing, and this last Advice: If Heav'n restores him to his lawful Crown, Let him wreak no Revenge upon his Foes, But think it his best Conquest to forgive; With Kindness let him treat Success, so shall she be A constant Guest; his Promise, when once given, Let no Advantage break; nor any View Make him give up his Honesty to reach it; Let him maintain his Pow'r, but not increase it; The String Prerogative, when strain'd too high, Cracks, like the tortur'd Chord of Harmony, And spoils the Consort between King and Subject; ‘Let him regard his People more than Minister, ‘Whose Interest or Ambition may mislead him; These Rules observ'd, may make him a good Prince, And happier than his Father—Wilt thou, James, Remember this? JAMES. O doubt not, Royal Sir, Can what my Father says escape my Memory, And at a time when he shall speak no more. KING. Come to my Arms, my Boy. JAMES. Would I cou'd weep the Blood that warms my Heart, For Water wrongs my Sorrow. KING. My dear Elizabeth, Draw near, and take thy dying Father's Blessing; Say to thy Mother (if thou e'er shalt see her) That my Thoughts never wander'd from her, that my Heart Holds her as dear, e'en in this Hour of Death, As when my Eyes first languish'd on her Beauties: Tell her, that Charles is only gone before To merit an immortal Crown, and share it with her! Farewel, Elizabeth, and let thy Love, And thy Obedience wait thy Brother Charles. ELIZABETH. Alas, my Father, I but now have found A Passage for my Words, and yet you say Farewel already. KING. Come, my little Glo'ster. Come to my Arms, and let me kiss thy Cheek. GLO'STER. Alas, my Lord! 'tis cold and wet with Tears, I'll wipe it dry, and warm it with my Hand, That it may meet your Kindness as it ought. KING. Glo'ster, when I am dead, your Brother Charles Is then your King and Master—Love and obey him. These Men who shall cut off thy Father's Head, When I am dead, perhaps, may make thee King; But do not thou, I charge thee on my Blessing, Accept the Crown while thy two Brothers live; Consider, Glo'ster, they were born before thee, And have an elder Title; wilt thou, Glo'ster? GLO'STER. A King! no, they shall tear me first in Pieces. KING. O Nature, Nature, do not strike so deeply; This Scene is worse than Death—I am ready, Sir. [Tomlinson at the Door. JAMES. O, Sir. ELIZABETH. My Lord! GLO'STER. My Father. KING. Oh! GLO'STER. I cannot part from you, my dearest Father! Would not those bloody Men that cut your Head off, If I should beg it, cut off mine? KING. Heart, thou art Marble, not to break at this— Yet I must go, for dire Necessity Has struggled long with my paternal Fondness, And has at length prevail'd: Farewel at once, [Going, returns. I thought I had taken my last Leave of them, But find that Nature calls me back again, And asks another Look, another parting Kiss; [Embrace. Be virtuous, and be happy. GLO'STER. O my poor Father— [They are led off. KING. So, now 'tis over—Let thy friendly Aid, Good Juxon, bear me Company to Death— Now, Sir, lead on; ere long I hope to see A World more glorious; where no Discord lives, Nor Error rises, and no Faction thrives: There the unfetter'd Mind Perfection knows, And looks with Pity upon humane Woes. [Exeunt. Enter Duke of RICHMOND, and Marquiss of LINDSEY. RICHMOND. O fatal Day! now Horror is on foot In her worst Garb, and stern Calamity Can do no more to England: Charles's Sun Sets in his Blood, and blushes for his People. LINDSEY. What awful Majesty his Visage bears, Nor deigns the Tribute of one sorrowing Look, To grace Misfortune. RICHMOND. Look where Fairfax comes; His Motion wild, and his distemper'd Eye Shoots Fire around, and speaks some strange Emotion. Enter FAIRFAX. FAIRFAX. Curs'd be the Villain's Arts, and every Wile That wrought me to believe him: O Credulity, Thou hast as many Ears as Fame has Tongues, Open to every Sound of Truth and Falshood! 'Tis now too late, impossible to save him: Fool that I was, I knew him for a Villain, Yet trusted to him, to the Monster Cromwell. RICHMOND. Fairfax, the World acquits thee of the Deed; Thy Pow'r has labour'd strongly for his Safety:— Behold where Juxon the good Bishop comes, Return'd from his last Service to his Master. FAIRFAX. I will not stay to hear the sad Relation, But think on my Revenge on Cromwell; May the Mercy which he deny'd to Charles's mortal Part, Ne'er light upon his Soul, tho' at his last Intreaty. Enter JUXON. RICHMOND. Charles is at Peace. JUXON. He is, my gentle Lord; And may we all meet Death with equal Firmness! Patience sat by him in an Angel's Garb, And held out a full Bowl of rich Content, Of which he largely quaff'd: Then came Charity, And in behalf of Charles, with hasty Hand, Dealt round Forgiveness to the World; his Pray'r Was for his Foes more earnest than himself, Because their Wants were greater—Thus fell Charles! A Monument of Shame to the present Age— A Warning to the future: His Example May prove this Maxim's Truth to all Mankind; The Subject's Reverence, and the Prince's Love, Grasping, and grasp'd, walk Hand in Hand together, Strengthned by Union; then, the King's Command Is lost in the Obedience of the Subject; The King, unask'd, confirm'd the Peoples Rights, And by the willing Gift prevents the Claim: These are the Virtues that endear a King, Adorn a People, and true Greatness bring. The End of the Fifth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by a FRIEND, Spoken by Mrs. GIFFARD. At length, our Bard has told his dismal Story; He thinks—without Offence to Whig or Tory! He writes not from a Spirit of Contention; And only on third Nights expects—his Pension. Ladies, when civil Dudgeon first grew high, And the good Folks fell out—they knew not why— A stubborn Race—no Doubt on't—were those Roundheads— Rebels at once to Female Power, and Crown'd-heads!— But now—blest Change!—our Heroes give their Votes For Government of Kings, and Petticoats!— Had we then liv'd:—What Crouds of Voluntiers! Down with the Rump! and high for Cavaliers! In those prim Times—our Grandmothers of Yore— Preferr'd a Pray'r-book to a Matadore.— At Court each Turtle only lov'd her Mate, And no Intrigues went on but those—of State!— What odious Salique Law ('twas none of Nature!) Excludes us Women from the Legislature? Cou'd we assemble once in Convocation; How purely wou'd we settle all the Nation! Lovers and Op'ras shou'd employ our Cares, Cards, Masquerades, and—such-like State-Affairs!— Debates, like a Male-Senate, we cou'd handle; And move, as well as they, to—snuff a Candle! Our Ay's and No's, with one shrill Voice declare; And none be Mutes; but all, all Speakers there! Now, on our Stage, while Charles once more is try'd! He hopes none here can prove a Regicide!— A milder Sentence to receive, his Trust is, Tremendous Pit, in your high Court of Justice! If bravely you'd support the good old Cause, Atone your Father's Crimes by your Applause! Lay not a barb'rous Tax on your Good-nature, Nor raise in Spleen, the Funds of Wit, by Satire! FINIS.</field>
