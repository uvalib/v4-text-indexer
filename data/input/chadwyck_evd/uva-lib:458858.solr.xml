      <field name="fulltext">To the onely rewarder, and most iust poiser of vertuous merits, the most honorably renowned No-body, bountious MecÃ¦nas of Poetry, and Lord Protector of oppressed innocence, Do, Dedicoque.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Play called Antonio and Mellida. Induction. Enter Galeatzo, Piero, Alberto, Antonio, Forobosco, Balurdo, Matzagente, &amp; Feliche, with parts in their hands: hauing cloakes cast ouer their apparell. Come sirs, come: the musique will sounde straight for entrance. Are yee readie, are yee perfect? Pier. Faith, we can say our parts: but wee are ignorant in what mould we must cast our Actors. Albert. Whome doe you personate? Pie, Piero, Duke of Venice. Alb. O, ho: then thus frame your exterior shape, To hautie forme of elate maiestie; As if you held the palsey shaking head Of reeling chaunce, vnder your fortunes belt, In strictest vassalage: growe big in thought, As swolne with glory of succesfull armes. Pie. If that be all, feare not, Ile sute it right. Who can not be proud, stroak vp the haire, and strut! Al. Truth: such ranke custome is growne popular; And now the vulgar fashion strides as wide, And stalkes as proud, vpon the weakest stilts Of the slight'st fortunes, as if Hercules, Or burly Atlas shouldred vp their state. Pi. Good: but whome act you? Alb. The necessitie of the play forceth me to act two parts; Andrugio, the distressed Duke of Genoa, and Alberto, a Venetian gentleman, enamoured on the Ladie Rossaline: whose fortunes being too weake to sustaine the port of her, he prou'd alwaies desastrous in loue: his worth being much vnderpoised by the vneuen scale, that currants all thinges by the outwarde stamp of opini?. Gal. Wel, and what dost thou play? Ba. The part of all the world. Alb. The part of all the world? What's that? Bal. The foole. I in good deede law now, I play Balurdo, a wealthie mountbanking Burgomasco's heire of Venice. Alb. Ha, ha: one, whose foppish nature might seem great, only for wise mens recreation; and, like a Iuicelesse barke, to preserue the sap of more strenuous spirits. A seruile hounde, that loues the sent of forerunning fashion, like an emptie hollow vault, still giuing an eccho to wit: greedily champing what any other well valued iudgement had before hand shew'd. Foro. Ha, ha, ha: tolerably good, good faith sweet wag. Alb. Vmh, why tolerably good, good faith sweet wag? Go, goe; you flatter me. Foro. Right, I but dispose my speach to the habit of my part. Alb. Why, what plaies he? To Feliche. Fe. The wolfe, that eats into the breast of Princes; that breeds the Lethargy and falling sicknesse in honour; makes Iustice looke asquint, and blinks the eye of merited rewarde from viewing desertfull vertue. Alb. Whats all this Periphrasis? ha? Fe. The substance of a supple-chapt flatterer. Alb. O, doth he play Forobosco, the Parasite? Good ifaith. Sirrah, you must seeme now as glib and straight in outward semblance, as a Ladies buske; though inwardly, as crosse as a paire of Tailors legs: hauing a tongue as nimble as his needle, with seruile patches of glauering flattery, to stitch vp the bracks of vnworthily honourd. Fo. I warrant you, I warrant you, you shall see mee prooue the very Perewig to couer the balde pate of brainelesse gentilitie. Ho, I will so tickle the sense of bella gratiosa madonna, with the titillation of Hyperbolicall praise, that Ile strike it in the nick, in the very nick, chuck. Fel. Thou promisest more, than I hope any Spectator giues faith of performance: but why looke you so duskie? ha? To Antonio. Ant. I was neuer worse fitted since the natiuitie of my Actorshippe: I shalt be hist at, on my life now. Fel. Why, what must you play? Ant. Faith, I know not what: an Hermaphrodite; two parts in one: my true person being Antonio, son to the Duke of Genoa; though for the loue of Mellida, Pieros daughter, I take this fained presence of an Amazon, calling my selfe Florizell, and I know not what. I a voice to play a lady! I shall nere doe it. Al. O, an Amazon should haue such a voice, virago-like. Not play two parts in one? away, away: tis common fashion. Nay if you cannot bear two subtle fr?ts vnder one hood, Ideot goe by, goe by; off this worlds stage. O times impuritie! An. I, but wh? vse hath taught me acti?, to hit the right point of a Ladies part, I shall growe ignorant when I must turne young Prince againe, how but to trusse my hose. Fe. Tush neuer put them off: for women weare the breaches still. Mat. By the bright honour of a Millanoise, and the resplendent fulgor of this steele, I will defende the feminine to death; and ding his spirit to the verge of hell, that dares diuulge a Ladies preiudice. Exit Ant. &amp; Al. Fel Rampum scrampum, mount tuftie Tamburlaine. What rattling thunder clappe breakes from his lips? Alb. O, 'tis natiue to his part. For, acting a moderne Bragadoch vnder the person of Matzagente, the Duke of Millaines sonne, it may seeme to suite with good fashion of coherence. Pie. But me thinks he speakes with a spruce Attick accent of adulterate Spanish. Al. So 'tis resolu'd. For, Millane being halfe Spanish, halfe high Dutch, and halfe Italians, the blood of chifest houses, is corrupt and mungrel'd: so that you shal see a fellow vaine-glorious, for a Spaniard; gluttonous, for a Dutchman; proud, for an Italian; and a fantastick Ideot, for all. Such a one conceipt this Matzagente. Fe. But I haue a part allotted mee, which I haue neither able apprehension to conceipt, nor what I conceipt gratious abilitie to vtter. Gal. Whoop, in the old cut? good shew vs a draught of thy spirit. Fel. Tis steddie, and must seeme so impregnably fortrest with his own c?tent, that no enuious thought could euer inuade his spirit: neuer surueying any man so vnmeasuredly happie, whome I thought not iustly hatefull for some true impouerishment: neuer beholding any fauour of Madam Felicity gracing another, which his well bounded content perswaded not to hang in the front of his owne fortune: and therefore as farre from enuying any man, as he valued all men infinitely distant from accomplisht beatitude. These natiue adiuncts appropriate to me the name of Feliche. But last, good thy humour. Exit Alb. A. Tis to be describ'd by signes &amp; tokens. For vnlesse I were possest with a legi? of spirits, 'tis impossible to be made perspicuous by any vtterance: For sometimes he must take austere state, as for the person of Galeatzo, the sonne of the duke of Florence, &amp; possesse his exteriour presence with a formall maiestie: keepe popularitie in distance, and on the sudden fling his honour so prodigally into a common Arme, that hee may seeme to giue vp his indiscretion to the mercy of vulgar c?sure: Now as solemne as a trauailer, and as graue as a Puritanes ruffe: with the same breath as slight and scatterd in his fashion as as as a a any thing. Now, as sweet and neat as a Barbours casting-bottle; straight as slouenly as the yeasty breast of an Ale-knight: now, lamenting: then chafing: straight laughing: then Feli. What then? Anto. Faith I know not what: 'tad bene a right part for Proteus or Gew: ho, blinde Gew would ha don't rarely, rarely. Feli. I feare it is not possible to limme so many persons in so small a tablet as the compasse of our playes afford. Anto. Right: therefore I haue heard that those persons, as he &amp; you Feliche, that are but slightly drawen in this Comedie, should receiue more exact accomplishment in a second Part: which, if this obtaine gratious acceptance, meanes to try his fortune. Feli. Peace, here comes the Prologue, cleare the Stage. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. The wreath of pleasure, and delicious sweetes, Begirt the gentle front of this faire troope: Select, and most respected Auditours, For wits sake doe not dreame of miracles. Alas, we shall but falter, if you lay The least sad waight of an vnused hope, Vpon our weakenesse: onely we giue vp The woorthlesse present of slight idlenesse, To your authentick censure; O that our Muse Had those abstruse and synowy faculties, That with a straine of fresh inuention She might presse out the raritie of Art; The pur'st elixed ioyce of rich conceipt, In your attentiue eares; that with the lip Of gratious elocution, we might drinke A sound carouse vnto your health of wit. But O, the heathy drynesse of her braine, Foyle to your fertile spirits, is asham'd To breath her blushing numbers to such eares: Yet (most ingenious) deigne to vaile our wants; With sleeke acceptance, polish these rude Sceanes: And if our slightnesse your large hope beguiles, Check not with bended brow, but dimpled smiles. Exit Prologue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS PRIMVS. The Cornets sound a battle within. Enter Antonio, disguised like an Amazon. An. Heart, wilt not break! &amp; thou abhorred life Wilt thou still breath in my enraged bloud? Vaines, synewes, arteries, why crack yee not? Burst and diuul'st, with anguish of my griefe. Can man by no meanes creepe out of himselfe, And leaue the slough of viperous griefe behinde? Antonio, hast thou seene a fight at sea, As horrid as the hideous day of doome; Betwixt thy father, duke of Genoa, And proud Piero, the Venetian Prince? In which the sea hath swolne with Genoas bloud, And made spring tydes with the warme reeking gore, That gusht from out our Gallies scupper holes; In which, thy father, poore Andrugio, Lyes sunk, or leapt into the armes of chaunce, Choakt with the laboring Oceans brackish fome; Who euen, despite Pieros cancred hate, VVould with an armed hand haue seiz'd thy loue, And linkt thee to the beautious Mellida. Haue I outliu'd the death of all these hopes? Haue I felt anguish pourd into my heart, Burning like Balsamum in tender wounds; And yet dost liue! could not the fretting sea Haue rowl'd me vp in wrinkles of his browe? Is death growen coy? or grim confusion nice? That it will not accompany a wretch, But I must needs be cast on Venice shoare? And try new fortunes with this strange disguise? To purchase my adored Mellida. The Cornets sound a flourish: cease. Harke how Piero's triumphs beat the ayre, O rugged mischiefe how thou grat'st my heart! Take spirit, blood, disguise, be confident: Make a firme stand, here rests the hope of all, Lower then hell, there is no depth to fall. The Cornets sound a Synnet: Enter Feliche and Alberto, Castilio and Forobosco, a Page carying a shield: Piero in Armour: Catzo and Dildo and Balurdo: All these (sauing Piero) armed with Petronels: Beeing entred, they make a stand in diuided foyles. Piero. Victorious Fortune, with tryumphant hand, Hurleth my glory 'bout this ball of earth, Whil'st the Venetian Duke is heaued vp On wings of faire successe, to ouer-looke The low cast ruines of his enemies, To see my selfe ador'd, and Genoa quake, My fate is firmer then mischance can shake. Feli. Stand, the ground trembleth. Piero. Hah? an earthquake? Ball. Oh, I smell a sound. Feli. Piero stay, for I descry a fume, Creeping from out the bosome of the deepe, The breath of darkenesse, fatall when 'tis whist In greatnes stomacke: this same smoake, call'd pride, Take heede shee'le lift thee to improuidence, And breake thy necke from steepe securitie, Shee'le make thee grudge to let Iehoua share In thy successefull battailes: O, shee's ominous, Inticeth princes to deuour heauen, Swallow omnipotence, out-stare dread fate, Subdue Eternitie in giant thought, Heaues vp their hurt with swelling, puft conceit, Till their soules burst with venom'd Arrogance: Beware Piero, Rome it selfe hath tried, Confusions traine blowes vp this Babell pride. Pier. Pish, Dimitto superos, summa votorum attigi. Alberto, hast thou yeelded vp our fixt decree Vnto the Genoan Embassadour? Are they content if that their duke returne, To send his, and his sonne Antonios head, As pledges steept in bloud, to gaine their peace? Alb. With most obsequious, sleek-brow'd intertain, They all embrace it as most gratious. Pier. Are Proclamations sent through Italy, That whosoeuer brings Andrugios head, Or young Anthonios, shall be guerdoned With twentie thousand double Pistolets, And be indeened to Pieros loue? Forob. They are sent euery way: sound policy. Sweete Lord. Fel. Confusion to these limber Sycophants. No sooner mischief's borne in regenty, But flattery christens it with pollicy. tacitÃ¨ Pier. VVhy then: O me Celitum excelsissimum! The intestine malice, and inueterate hate I alwaies bore to that Andrugio, Glories in triumph ore his misery: Nor shall that carpet-boy Antonio Match with my daughter, sweet cheekt Mellida. No, the publick power makes my faction strong. Fel. Ill, when publick power str?gthneth priuate wr?g. Pie. Tis horse-like, not for man, to know his force. Fel. Tis god-like, for a man to feele remorse. Pie. Pish, I prosecute my families reuenge, VVhich Ile pursue with such a burning chace Till I haue dri'd vp all Andrugios bloud; VVeake rage, that with slight pittie is withstoode. The Cornets sound a florish. VVhat meanes that fresh triumphall florish sound? Alb. The prince of Millane, and young Florence heir Approach to gratulate your victorie. Pie. VVeele girt them with an ample waste of loue; Conduct them to our presence royally. Let vollies of the great Artillery From of our gallies banks play prodigall, And so?d lowd welcome fr? their bellowing mouths. Exit Piero tantÃ¹m. The Cornets sound a Cynet. Enter aboue, Mellida, Rossaline and Flauia: Enter belowe, Galeatzo with attendants: Piero meeteth him, embraceth; at which the Cornets sound a florish: Piero and Galeatzo exeunt: the rest stand still. Mell. VVhat prince was that passed through my fathers guard? Fla. Twas Galeatzo, the young Florentine. Ros. Troth, one that will besiege thy maidenhead, Enter the wals yfaith (sweet Mellida) If that thy flankers be not Canon proofe. Mell. Oh Mary Ambree, good, thy iudgement wench; Thy bright electious cleere, what will he prooue? Ross. Hath a short finger and a naked chinne; A skipping eye, dare lay my iudgement (faith) His loue is glibbery; there's no hold ont, wench: Giue me a husband whose aspect is firme, A full cheekt gallant, with a bouncing thigh: Oh, he is the Paradizo dell madonne contento. Mell. Euen such a one was my Antonio. The Cornets sound a Cynet. Rossa. By my nine and thirteth seruant (sweete) Thou art in loue, but stand on tiptoed faire, Here comes Saint Tristram Tirlery whiffe yfaith. Enter Matzagente, Piero meetes him, embraceth; at which the Cornets sound a florish: they two stand, vsing seeming complements, whilst the Sceane passeth aboue. Mell. S. Marke, S. Marke, what kind of thing appears? Ross. For fancies passion, spit vpon him; figh: His face is varnisht: in the name of loue, VVhat country bred that creature? Mell. VVhat is he Flauia? Fla. The heire of Millane, Segnior Matzagent. Ross. Matzagent? now by my pleasures hope, He is made like a tilting staffe; and lookes For all the world like an ore-rosted pigge: A great Tobacco taker too, thats flat. For his eyes looke as if they had bene hung In the smoake of his nose. Mell. What husband, wil he prooue sweete Rossaline? Ross. Auoid him: for he hath a dwindled legge, A lowe forehead, and a thinne cole-black beard, And will be iealous too, beleeue it sweete: For his chin sweats, and hath a gander neck, A thinne lippe, and a little monkish eye: Pretious, what a slender waste he hath! He lookes like a May-pole, or a notched stick: Heele snap in two at euery little straine. Giue me a husband that will fill mine armes, Of steddie iudgement, quicke and nimble sense: Fooles relish not a Ladies excellence. Exeunt all on the lower Stage: at which the Cornets sound a florish, and a peale of shot is giuen. Mell. The tryumph's ended, but looke Rossaline, What gloomy soule in strange accustrements Walkes on the pauement. Rossa. Good sweete lets to her, pree the Mellida. Mell. How couetous thou art of nouelties! Rossa. Pish, tis our nature to desire things That are thought strangers to the common cut. Mell. I am exceeding willing, butâ Ross. But what? pree the goe downe, lets see her face: God send that neither wit nor beauty wants Those tempting sweets, affections Adamants. Exeunt. Anto. Come downe, she comes like: O, no Simile Is pretious, choyce, or elegant enough To illustrate her descent: leape heart, she comes, She comes: smile heauen, and softest Southern winde Kisse her cheeke gently with perfumed breath. She comes: Creations puritie, admir'd, Ador'd, amazing raritie, she comes. O now Antonio presse thy spirit forth In following passion, knit thy senses close, Heape vp thy powers, double all thy man: Enter Mellida, Rossaline, and Flauia. She comes. O how her eyes dart wonder on my heart! Mount bloode, soule to my lips, tast Hebes cup: Stand firme on decke, when beauties close fight's vp. Mel. Ladie, your strange habit doth beget Our pregnant thoughts, euen great of much desire, To be acquaint with your condition. Rossa. Good sweete Lady, without more ceremonies, What country claims your birth, &amp; sweet your name? Anto. In hope your bountie will extend it selfe, In selfe same nature of faire curtesie, Ile shunne all nicenesse; my nam's Florizell, My country Scythia, I am Amazon, Cast on this shore by furie of the sea. Ross. Nay faith, sweete creature, weele not vaile our names. It pleas'd the Font to dip me Rossaline: That Ladie beares the name of Mellida, The duke of Venice daughter. Anto. Madam, I am oblig'd to kisse your hand, By imposition of a now dead man. To Mellida kissing her hand. Rossa. Now by my troth, I long beyond all thought, To know the man; sweet beauty deigne his name. Anto. Ladie, the circumstance is tedious. Ros. Troth not a whit; good faire, lets haue it all: I loue not, I, to haue a iot left out, If the tale come from a lou'd Orator. Anto. Vouchsafe me then your hush't obseruances. Vehement in pursuite of strange nouelties, After long trauaile through the Asian maine, I shipt my hopefull thoughts for Britany; Longing to viewe great natures miracle, The glorie of our sex, whose fame doth strike Remotest eares with adoration. Sayling some two monthes with inconstant winds, We view'd the glistering Venetian forts; To which we made: when loe, some three leagues off, We might descry a horred spectacle: The issue of black fury strow'd the sea, With tattered carcasses of splitted ships, Halfe sinking, burning, floating, topsie turuie. Not farre from these sad ruines of fell rage, We might behold a creature presse the waues; Senselesse he sprauld, all notcht with gaping wounds: To him we made, and (short) we tooke him vp: The first word that he spake was, Mellida; And then he swouned. Mell. Aye me! Anto. Why sigh you, faire? Ross. Nothing but little humours: good sweet, on. Anto. His wounds being drest, and life recouered, We gan discourse; when loe, the sea grewe mad, His bowels rumbling with winde passion, Straight swarthy darknesse popt out PhÅbus eye, And blurd the iocund face of bright cheekt day; Whilst crudl'd fogges masked euen darknesse brow: Heauen bad's good night, and the rocks gron'd At the intestine vprore of the maine. Now gustie flawes strook vp the very heeles Of our maine mast, whilst the keene lightning shot Through the black bowels of the quaking ayre: Straight chops a waue, and in his sliftred panch Downe fals our ship, and there he breaks his neck: Which in an instant vp was belkt againe. VVhen thus this martyrd soule began to sigh; Giue me your hand (quoth he) now doe you graspe Th'vnequall mirrour of ragg'd misery: Is't not a horrid storme? O, well shap't sweete, Could your quicke eye strike through these gashed wo?ds, You should beholde a heart, a heart, faire creature, Raging more wilde then is this franticke sea. VVolt doe me a fauour, if thou chance suruiue? But visit Venice, kisse the pretious white Of my most; nay all all Epithites are base To attribute to gratious Mellida: Tell her the spirit of Antonio VVisheth his last gaspe breath'd vpon her breast. Ros. VVhy weepes soft hearted Florisell? Ant. Alas, the flintie rocks groand at his plaints. Tell her (quoth he) that her obdurate sire Hath crackt his bosome; therewithall he wept, And thus sigh't on. The sea is merciful; Looke how it gapes to bury all my griefe: Well, thou shalt haue it, thou shalt be his toumbe: My faith in my loue liue; in thee, dy woe, Dye vnmatcht anguish, dye Antonio: With that he totterd from the reeling decke, And downe he sunke. Ross. Pleasures bodie, what makes my Lady weepe? Mell. Nothing, sweet Rossaline, but the ayer's sharpe. My fathers Palace, Madam, will be proud To entertaine your presence, if youle daine To make repose within. Aye me! Ant. Ladie our fashion is not curious. Ross. Faith all the nobler, tis more generous. Mell. Shall I then know how fortune fell at last, What succour came, or what strange fate insew'd? Ant. Most willingly: but this same court is vast, And publike to the staring multitude. Rossa. Sweet Lady, nay good sweet, now by my troth VVeele be bedfellowes: durt on complement froth. Exeunt; Rossaline giuing Antonio the way.</field>

Then vrge no more; O leaue to loue at all; Tis lesse disgracefull, not to mount, then fall. Mat.

I would shoot some speach forth, to strike the time With pleasing touch of amorous complement. Say sweete, what keepes thy minde, what think'st thou on? Alb. Nothing, Rossa. Whats that nothing? Alb. A womans constancie. Rossa. Good, why, would'st thou haue vs sluts, &amp; neuer shift the vestur of our thoughts? Away for shame. Alb. O no, thart too constant to afflict my heart, Too too firme fixed in vnmooued scorne. Ross. Pish, pish; I fixed in vnmooued scorne? Why, Ile loue thee to night. Alb. But whome to morrow? Ross. Faith, as the toy puts me in the head. Bal. And pleased the marble heauens, now would I might be the toy, to put you in the head, kindly to conceipt my my my: pray you giue in an Epithite for loue. Fel. Roaring, roaring. O loue thou hast murdred me, made me a shadowe, and you heare not Balurdo, but Balurdos ghost. Rossa. Can a ghost speake? Bal. Scuruily, as I doe. Ross. And walke? Bal. After their fashion. Ross. And eate apples? Bal. In a sort, in their garbe. Feli. Pre thee Flauia be my mistresse. Fla. Your reason, good Feliche? Fel. Faith, I haue nineteene mistresses alreadie, and I not much disdeigne that thou should'st make vp the ful score. Fla. Oh, I heare you make common places of your mistresses, to performe the office of memory by. Pray you, in auncient times were not those satten hose? In good faith, now they are new dyed, pinkt &amp; scoured, they showe as well as if they were new. What, mute Balurdo? Feli. I in faith, &amp; twere not for printing, and painting, my breech, and your face would be out of reparation. Bal. I, an faith, and twere not for printing, &amp; pointing, my breech, and your face would be out of reparation. Fel. Good againe, Echo. Fla. Thou art, by nature, too foule to be affected. Feli. And thou, by Art, too faire to be beloued. By wits life, most sparke spirits, but hard chance. Latydine. Pie. Gallants, the night growes old; &amp; downy sleep Courts vs, to entertaine his company: Our tyred lymbes, brus'd in the morning fight, Intreat soft rest, and gentle husht repose. Fill out Greeke wines; prepare fresh cressit-light: Weele haue a banquet: Princes, then good night. The Cornets sound a Synnet, and the Duke goes out in state. As they are going out, Antonio stayes Mellida: the rest Exeunt. An. What meanes these scattred looks? why tremble you? Why quake your thoughts, in your distracted eyes? Collect your spirits, Madam; what doe you see? Dost not beholde a ghost? Look, look where he stalks, wrapt vp in clouds of grief, Darting his sowle, vpon thy wondring eyes. Looke, he comes towards thee; see, he stretcheth out His wretched armes to girt thy loued waste, With a most wisht embrace: see'st him not yet? Nor yet? Ha, Mellida; thou well maist erre: For looke; he walkes not like Antonio: Like that Antonio, that this morning shone, In glistering habilliments of armes, To seize his loue, spight of her fathers spite: But like himselfe, wretched, and miserable, Banisht, forlorne, despairing, strook quite through, With sinking griefe, rowld vp in seauen-fould doubles Of plagues, vanquishable: harke, he speakes to thee. Mell. Alas, I can not heare, nor see him. Anto. Why? al this night about the roome he stalkt, And groand, and houl'd, with raging passion, To view his loue (life blood of all his hopes, Crowne of his fortunes) clipt by strangers armes. Looke but behinde thee. Mel. O, Antonio; my Lord, my Loue, my An. Leaue passion, sweet; for time, place, aire, &amp; earth, Are all our foes: feare, and be iealous; faire, Lets fly. Mell. Deare heart; ha, whether? Anto. O, tis no matter whether, but lets fly. Ha! now I thinke ont, I haue nere a home: No father, friend, no country to imbrace These wretched limbes: the world, the All that is, Is all my foe: a prince not worth a doite: Onelie my head is hoised to high rate, Worth twentie thousand double Pistolets, To him that can but strike it from these shoulders. But come sweete creature, thou shalt be my home; My father, country, riches, and my friend: My all, my soule; and thou and I will liue: (Lets thinke like what) and thou and I will liue Like vnmatcht mirrors of calamitie. The iealous eare of night eaue-drops our talke. Holde thee, thers a iewell; &amp; look thee, thers a note That will direct thee when, where, how to fly; Bid me adieu. Mell. Farewell bleak misery. Anto. Stay sweet, lets kisse before you goe. Mel. Farewell deare soule. Anto. Farewell my life, my heart.</field>

Pree the obserue the custome of the world, That onely flatters greatnesse, States exalts. And please my excellence! O Lucio. Thou hast bin euer held respected deare, Euen pretious to Andrugios in most loue. Good, flatter not. Nay, if thou giu'st not faith That I am wretched, O read that, read that. Piero Sforza, to the Italian Princes, fortune. Excellent, the iust ouerthrowe, Andrugio tooke in the Venetian gulfe, hath so assured the Genowaies of the iustice of his cause, and the hatefulnesse of his person, that they haue banisht him and all his family: and, for confirmation of their peace with vs, haue vowed, that if he, or his sonne, can be attached, to send vs both their heads. Wee therefore, by force of our vnited league, forbid you to harbour him, or his blood: but if you apprehend his person, we intreat you to send him, or his head, to vs. For wee vowe by the honour of our blood, to recompence any man that bringeth his head, with twentie thousand double Pistolets, and the indeering to our choysest loue. From Venice: Piero sforza. Andr. My thoughts are fixt in contemplation Why this huge earth, this monstrous animal, That eates her children, should not haue eyes &amp; ears. Philosophie maintaines that Natur's wise, And formes no vselesse or vnperfect thing. Did Nature make the earth, or the earth Nature? For earthly durt makes all things, makes the man, Moulds me vp honour; and like a cunning Dutchm?, Paints me a puppit euen with seeming breath, And giues a sot appearance of a soule, Goe to, goe to; thou liest Philosophy. Nature formes things vnperfect, vselesse, vaine Why made she not the earth with eyes and eares? That she might see desert, and heare mens plaints: That when a soule is splitted, sunke with griefe, He might fall thus, vpon the breast of earth; And in her eare, halloo his misery: Exclaming thus. O thou all bearing earth, Which men doe gape for, till thou cramst their mouths, And choakst their throts with dust: O chaunce thy brest, And let me sinke into thee. Looke who knocks; Andrugio cals. But O, she's deafe and blinde. A wretch, but leane reliefe on earth can finde. Lu. Sweet Lord, abandon passion, and disarme. Since by the fortune of the tumbling sea, We are rowl'd vp, vpon the Venice marsh, Lets clip all fortune, least more lowring fate And. More lowring fate? O Lucio, choak that breath. Now I defie chaunce. Fortunes browe hath frown'd, Euen to the vtmost wrinkle it can bend: Her venom's spit. Alas, what country rests, What sonne, what comfort that she can depriue? Tryumphes not Venice in my ouerthrow? Gapes not my natiue country for my blood? Lies not my sonne tomb'd in the swelling maine? And yet more lowring fate? There's nothing left Vnto Andrugio, but Andrugio: And that nor mischief, force, distresse, nor hel can take. Fortune my fortunes, not my minde shall shake. Lu. Speake like your selfe: but giue me leaue, my Lord, To wish your safetie. If you are but seene, Your armes display you; therefore put them off, And take And. Would'st thou haue me go vnarm'd among my foes? Being besieg'd by passion, entring lists, To combat with despaire and mightie griefe: My soule beleaguerd with the crushing strength Of sharpe impatience. Ha Lucio, goe vnarm'd? Come soule, resume the valour of thy brith; My selfe, my selfe will dare all opposits: Ile muster forces, an vnuanquisht power: Cornets of horse shall presse th'vngratefull earth; This hollow wombed masse shall inly grone, And murmur to sustaine the waight of armes: Gastly amazement, with vpstarted haire, Shall hurry on before, and vsher vs, Whil'st trumpets clamour, with a sound of death. Lu. Peace, good my Lord, your speach is al too light. Alas, suruey your fortunes, looke what's left Of all your forces, and your vtmost hopes? A weake old man, a Page, and your poore selfe. And. Andrugio liues, and a faire cause of armes, Why that's an armie all inuincible. He who hath that, hath a battalion Royal, armour of proofe, huge troups of barbed steeds, Maine squares of pikes, millions of harguebush. O, a faire cause stands firme, and will abide. Legions of Angels fight vpon her side. Lu. Then, noble spirit, slide in strange disguise, Vnto some gratious Prince, and soiourne there, Till time, and fortune giue reuenge firme meanes. And. No, ile not trust the honour of a man: Golde is growne great, and makes perfidiousnesse A common water in most Princes Courts: He's in the Chekle-roule: Ile not trust my blood; I know none breathing, but will cogge a dye For twentie thousand double Pistolets. How goes the time? Luc. I saw no sunne to day. And. No sun wil shine, where poor Andrugio breaths. My soule growes heauie: boy let's haue a song: Weele sing yet, faith, euen despite of fate. CANTANT. And. Tis a good boy, &amp; by my troth, well sung. O, and thou felt'st my griefe, I warrant thee, Thou would'st haue strook diuision to the height; And made the life of musicke breath: hold boy: why so? For Gods sake call me not Andrugio, That I may soone forget what I haue bin. For heauens name, name not Antonio; That I may not remember he was mine. Well, ere yon sunne set, ile shew my selfe my selfe, Worthy my blood. I was a Duke; that's all. No matter whether, but from whence we fall. Exeunt. Enter Feliche walking, vnbrac't. Fe. Castilio? Alberto? Balurdo? none vp? Forobosco? Flattery, nor thou vp yet: Then there's no Courtier stirring: that's firme truth? I cannot sleepe: Feliche seldome rests In these court lodgings. I haue walkt all night, To see if the nocturnall court delights Could force me enuie their felicitie: And by plaine troth; I will confesse plaine troth: I enuie nothing, but the Trauense light. O, had it eyes, and eares, and tongues, it might See sport, heare speach of most strange surquedries. O, if that candle-light were made a Poet, He would prooue a rare firking Satyrist, And drawe the core forth of impostum'd sin. Well, I thanke heauen yet, that my content Can enuie nothing, but poore candle-light. As for the other glistering copper spangs, That glisten in the tyer of the Court, Praise God, I eyther hate, or pittie them. Well, here ile sleepe till that the sceane of vp Is past at Court. O calme husht rich content, Is there a being blessednesse without thee? How soft thou down'st the couch where thou dost rest, Nectar to life, thou sweet Ambrosian feast. Enter Castilio and his Page: Castilio with a casting bottle of sweete water in his hand, sprinkling himselfe. Cast. Am not I a most sweete youth now? Cat. Yes, when your throat's perfum'd; your verie words Doe smell of Amber greece. O stay sir, stay; Sprinkle some sweete water to your shooes heeles, That your mistresse may swear you haue a sweet foot. Cast. Good, very good, very passing passing good. Fel. Fut, what trebble minikin squeaks there, ha? good? very good, very very good? Casti. I will warble to the delicious concaue of my Mistresse eare: and strike her thoughts with The pleasing touch of my voice. CANTANT. Cast. Feliche, health, fortune, mirth, and wine, Fel. To thee my loue diuine. Cast. I drinke to thee, sweeting. Fel. Plague on thee for an Asse. Cast. Now thou hast seene the Court; by the perfecction of it, dost not enuie it? Fel. I wonder it doth not enuie me. Why man, I haue bene borne vpon the spirits wings, The soules swift Pegasus, the fantasie: And from the height of contemplation, Haue view'd the feeble ioynts men totter on. I enuie none; but hate, or pittie all. For when I viewe, with an intentiue thought, That creature faire; but proud; him rich, but sot: Th'other wittie; but vnmeasured arrogant: Him great; yet boundlesse in ambition: Him high borne; but of base life: to'ther feard; Yet feared feares, and fears most, to be most loued: Him wise; but made a foole for publick vse: Th'other learned, but selfe-opinionate: When I discourse all these, and see my selfe Nor faire, nor rich, nor wittie, great, nor fear'd: Yet amply suted, with all full content: Lord, how I clap my hands, and smooth my brow, Rubbing my quiet bosome, tossing vp A gratefull spirit to omnipotence! Cast. Ha, ha: but if thou knew'st my happinesse, Thou wouldst euen grate away thy soule to dust, In enuy of my sweete beatitude: I can not sleepe for kisses; I can not rest For Ladies letters, that importune me With such vnused vehemence of loue, Straight to solicit them, that Feli. Confusion seize me, but I thinke thou lyest. Why should I not be sought to then aswell? Fut, me thinks, I am as like a man. Troth, I haue a good head of haire, a cheeke Not as yet wan'd; a legge, faith, in the full. I ha not a red beard, take not tobacco much: And S'lid, for other parts of manlinesse Cast. Pew waw, you nere accourted them in pompe: Put your good parts in presence, gratiously. Ha, and you had, why they would ha come of, sprung To your armes: and su'd, and prai'd, and vow'd; And opened all their sweetnesse to your loue. Fel. There are a number of such things, as then Haue often vrg'd me to such loose beliefe: But S'lid you all doe lye, you all doe lie. I haue put on good cloathes, and smugd my face, Strook a faire wench, with a smart speaking eye: Courted in all sorts, blunt, and passionate; Had opportunitie put them to the ah: And, by this light, I finde them wondrous chaste, Impregnable; perchance a kisse, or so: But for the rest, O most inexorable. Cast. Nay then ifaith, pree thee looke here. Shewes him the superscription of a seeming Letter. Fel. To her most esteemed, lou'd, and generous seruant, Sig. Castilio Balthazar. Pree the from whome comes this? faith I must see. From her that is deuoted to thee, in most priuate sweetes of loue; Rossaline. Nay, god's my comfort, I must see the rest; I must, sans ceremonie, faith I must. Feliche takes away the letter by force. Cast. O, you spoyle my ruffe, vnset my haire; good away. Fel. Item for strait canuas, thirteene pence, halfe penny. Item for an elle and a halfe of taffata to couer your olde canuas dubblet, foureteen shillings, &amp; three pence. S'light, this a tailors bill. Cast. In sooth it is the outside of her letter; on which I tooke the copie of a tailors bill. Dil. But tis not crost, I am sure of that. Lord haue mercie on him, his credit hath giuen vp the last gaspe. Faith ile leaue him; for hee lookes as melancholy as a wench the first night she Exit. Feli. Honest musk-cod, twill not be so stitched together; take that, and that, and belie no Ladies loue: sweare no more by Iesu: this Madam, that Ladie; hence goe, forsweare the presence, trauaile three years to bury this bastinado: auoide, puffe paste, auoide. Cast. And tell not my Ladie mother. Well, as I am true gentleman, if she had not wild me on her blessing, not to spoyle my face; if I could not finde in my heart to fight, would I might nere eate a Potatoe pye more. Enter Balurdo, backward; Dildo following him with a looking glasse in one hand, &amp; a candle in the other hand: Flauia following him backward, with a looking glasse in one hand, and a candle in the other; Rossaline following her. Balurdo and Rossaline stand setting of faces: and so the Sceane begins. Fel. More foole, more rare fooles! O, for time and place, long enough, and large enough, to acte these fooles! Here might be made a rare Scene of folly, if the plat could beare it. Bal. By the suger-candy sky, holde vp the glasse higher, that I may see to sweare in fashion. O, one loofe more would ha made them shine; gods neakes, they would haue shone like my mystresse browe. Euen so the Duke frownes for all this Cursond world: oh that gerne kils, it kils. By my golden What's the richest thing about me? Dil. Your teeth. Bal. By my golden teeth, hold vp; that I may put in: hold vp, I say, that I may see to put on my gloues. Dil. O, delicious sweet cheekt master, if you discharge but one glance from the leuell of that set face: O, you will strike a wench; youle make any wench loue you. Balur. By Iesu, I think I am as elegant a Courtier, as How lik'st thou my suite? Catz. All, beyond all, no peregal: you are wondred at, for an asse. Bal. Well, Dildo, no christen creature shall knowe hereafter, what I will doe for thee heretofore. Ros. Here wants a little white, Flauia. Dil. I, but master, you haue one little falt; you sleepe open mouth'd. Ball. Pewe, thou iestst. In good sadnesse, Ile haue a looking glasse nail'd to the the testarn of the bed, that I may see when I sleep, whether tis so, or not; take heed you lye not: goe to, take heede you lie not. Fla. By my troth, you looke as like the princesse, now I, but her lip is lip is a little redder, a very little redder: but by the helpe of Art, or Nature, ere I ch?ge my perewigge, mine shall be as red Fla. O, I, that face, that eye, that smile, that writhing of your bodie, that wanton dandling of your fan, becoms prethely, so sweethly, tis euen the goodest Ladie that breathes, the most amiable Faith the fringe of your sattin peticote is ript. Good faith madam, they say you are the most bounteous Lady to your women, that euer O most delitious beautie! Good Madam let me kith it. Enter Piero. Feli. Rare sport, rare sport! A female foole, and a female flatterer. Ross. Bodie a mee, the Duke: away the glasse. Pie. Take vp your paper, Rossaline. Rossa. Not mine, my Lord. Pie. Not yours, my Ladie? Ile see what tis. Bal. And how does my sweete mistresse? O Ladie deare, euen as tis an olde say, Tis an old horse can neither wighy, nor wagge his taile: euen so doe I holde my set face still: euen so, tis a bad courtier that can neither discourse, nor blow his nose. Pie. Meet me at Abrahams, the Iewes, where I bought my Amazons disguise. A shippe lies in the port, ready bound for England; make haste, come priuate. Enter Castilio, Forobosco. Antonio, Forobosco, Alberto, Feliche, Castilio, Balurdo? run, keepe the Palace, post to the ports, goe to my daughters chamber: whether now? scud to the Iewes, stay, runne to the gates, stop the gundolets, let none passe the marsh, doe all at once. Antonio? his head, his head. Keep you the Court, the rest stand still, or runne, or goe, or shoute, or search, or scud, or call, or hang, or doe doe doe, su su su, somthing: I know not who who who, what I do do do, nor who who who, where I am. O trista traditriche, rea, ribalda fortuna, Negando mi vindetta mi causa fera morte. Fel. Ha ha ha. I could breake my splene at his impatience. Anto. Alma &amp; gratiosa fortuna siate fauorevole, Et fortunati siano vuoti del mia dulce Mellida, Mellida. Mel. Alas Antonio, I haue lost thy note. A number mount my staires; ile straight returne. Fel. Antonio, Be not affright, sweete Prince; appease thy feare, Buckle thy spirits vp, put all thy wits In wimble action, or thou art surpriz'd. Anto. I care not. Fel. Art mad, or desperate? or Anto. Both, both, all, all: I pree thee let mee ly; Spight of you all, I can, and I will dy. Fel. You are distraught; O, this is madnesse breath. An. Each man take hence life, but no man death: Hee's a good fellow, and keepes open house: A thousand thousand waies lead to his gate, To his wide mouth'd porch: when niggard life Hath but one little, little wicket through. We wring our selues into this wretched world, To pule, and weepe, exclaime, to curse and raile, To fret, and ban the fates, to strike the earth As I doe now. Antonio, curse thy birth, And die. Fel. Nay, heauens my comfort, now you are peruerse; You know I alwaies lou'd you; pree thee liue. Wilt thou strike deade thy friends, drawe mourning teares An. Alas, Feliche, I ha nere a friend; No country, father, brother, kinsman left To weepe my fate, or sigh my funerall: I roule but vp and downe, and fill a seat In the darke caue of dusky misery. Feli. Fore heauen, the Duke comes: hold you, take my key, Slinke to my chamber, looke you; that is it: There shall you finde a suite I wore at sea: Take it, and slippe away. Nay, pretious, If youle be peeuish, by this light, Ile sweare, Thou rail'dst vpon thy loue before thou dyedst, And call'd her strumpet. Ant. Sheele not credit thee. Fel. Tut, that's all one: ile defame thy loue; And make thy deade trunke held in vile regard. Ant. Wilt needs haue it so? why then Antonio, Viue esperanza, in despetto aell fato. Enter Piero, Galeatzo, Matzagente, Forobosco, Balurdo, and Castilio, with weapons. Piero. O, my sweet Princes, was't not brauely found? Euen there I found the note, euen there it lay. I kisse the place for ioy, that there it lay. This way he went, here let vs make a stand: Ile keepe this gate my selfe: O gallant youth! Ile drinke carouse vnto your countries health, Enter Antonio. Euen in Antonio's scull. Bal. Lord blesse vs: his breath is more fearefull then a Sergeants voice, when he cries; I arrest. Ant. Stoppe Antonio, keepe, keepe Antonio. Piero. Where, where man, where? Ant, Here, here: let me me pursue him downe the marsh. Pie. Hold, there's my signet, take a gundelet: Bring me his head, his head, and by mine honour, Ile make thee the wealthiest Mariner that breathes. Anto. Ile sweate my bloode out, till I haue him safe. Pie. Speake heartily ifaith, good Mariner. O, wee will mount in tryumph: soone, at night, Ile set his head vp. Lets thinke where. Bal. Vp on his shoulders, that's the fittest place for it. If it be not as fit as if it were made for them; say, Balurdo, thou art a sot, an asse. Enter Mellida in Pages attire, dauncing. Pie. Sprightly, ifaith. In troth he's somwhat like My daughter Mellida: but alas poore soule, Her honour heeles, god knowes, are halfe so light. Mel. Escap't I am, spite of my fathers spight. Pie. Ho, this will warme my bosome ere I sleepe. Enter Flauia running. Fla. O my Lord, your daughter. Pie. I, I, my daughter's safe enough, I warrant thee. This vengeance on the boy will lengthen out My daies vnmeasuredly. It shall be chronicled, time to come; Piero Sforza slewe Andrugio's sonne. Fla. I, but my Lord, your daughter. Pie. I, I, my good wench, she is safe enough. Fla. O, then, my Lord, you know she's run away. Pie. Run away, away, how run away? Fla. She's vanisht in an instante, none knowes whether. Pie. Pursue, pursue, fly, run, post, scud away. Feliche sing; And was not good king Salomon. Fly, call, run, rowe, ride, cry, shout, hurry, haste: Haste, hurry, shoute, cry, ride, rowe, run, call, fly Backward and forward, euery way about. Maldetta fortuna shy condura sorta Che faro, che diro, pur fugir tanto mal! Cast. Twas you that struck me euen now: was it not? Fel. It was I that struck you euen now. Cast. You bastinadoed me, I take it. Fel. I bastinadoed you, and you tooke it. Cast. Faith sir, I haue the richest Tobacco in the court for you; I would be glad to make you satisfaction, if I haue wronged you. I would not the Sun should set vpon your anger; giue me your hand. Fel. Content faith, so thou'lt breede no more such lies. I hate not man, but mans lewd qualities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS QVARTVS. Enter Antonio, in his sea gowne running. Ant. Stop, stop Antonio, stay Antonio. Vaine breath, vaine breath, Antonio's lost; He can not finde himselfe, not seize himselfe. Alas, this that you see, is not Antonio, His spirit houers in Piero's Court, Hurling about his agill faculties, To apprehend the sight of Mellida: But poore, poore soule, wanting apt instruments To speake or see, stands dumbe and blinde, sad spirit, Roul'd vp in gloome clouds as black as ayor, Through which the rustie coach of Night is drawne: Tis so, ile giue you instance that tis so. Conceipt you me. As hauing clasp't a rose Within my palme, the rose being tane away, My hand retaines a little breath of sweete: So may mans trunke; his spirit slipt awaie, Holds still a faint perfume of his sweet ghest. Tis so; for when discursiue powers flie out, And rome in progresse, through the bo?ds of heauen, The soule it selfe gallops along with them, As chiefetaine of this winged troope of thought, Whilst the dull lodge of spirit standeth waste, Vntill the soule returne from What wast I said? O, this is naught, but speckling melancholie. I haue beene That Morpheus tender skinp Cosen germane Beare with me good Mellida: clod vpon clod thus fall. Hell is beneath; yet heauen is ouer all. Enter Andrugio, Lucio, Cole, and Norwod. And. Come Lucio, lets goe eat: what hast thou got? Rootes, rootes? alas, they are seeded, new cut vp. O, thou hast wronged Nature, Lucio: But bootes not much; thou but pursu'st the world, That cuts off vertue, fore it comes to growth, Least it should seed, and so orerun her sonne, Dull pore-blinde error. Giue me water, boy. There is no poison in't I hope, they say That lukes in massie plate: and yet the earth Is so infected with a generall plague, That hee's most wise, that thinks there's no man foole: Right prudent, that esteemes no creature iust: Great policy the least things to mistrust. Giue me Assay How we mock greatnesse now! Lu. A strong conceipt is rich, so most men deeme: If not to be, tis comfort yet to seeme. And. Why man, I neuer was a Prince till now. Tis not the bared pate, the bended knees, Guilt tipstaues, Tyrrian purple, chaires of state, Troopes of pide butterflies, that flutter still In greatnesse summer, that confirme a prince: Tis not the vnsauory breath of multitudes, Showting and clapping, with confused dinne; That makes a Prince. No Lucio, he's a king, A true right king, that dares doe aught, saue wrong, Feares nothing mortall, but to be vniust, Who is not blowne vp with the flattering puffes Of spungy Sycophants: Who stands vnmou'd, Despight the iustling of opinion: Who can enjoy himselfe, maugre the throng That striue to presse his quiet out of him: Who sits vpon Ioues footestoole, as I doe, Adoring, not affecting, maiestie: Whose brow is wreathed with the siluer crowne Of cleare content: this, Lucio, is a king. And of this empire, euery man's possest, That's worth his soule. Lu. My Lord, the Genowaies had wont to say And. Name not the Genowaies: that very word Vnkings me quite, makes me vile passions slaue. O, you that made open the glibbery Ice Of vulgar fauour, viewe Andrugio. Was neuer Prince with more applause confirm'd, With louder shouts of tryumph launched out Into the surgy maine of gouernment: Was neuer Prince with more despight cast out, Left shipwrackt, banisht, on more guiltlesse ground. O rotten props of the craz'd multitude, How you stil double, faulter, vnder the lightest chance That straines your vaines. Alas, one battle lost, Your whorish loue, your drunken healths, your houts and shouts, Your smooth God saue's, and all your diuels last That tempts our quiet, to your hell of throngs. Spit on me Lucio, for I am turnd slaue Obserue how passion domineres ore me. Lu. No wonder, noble Lord, hauing lost a sonne, A country, crowne, and And. I Lucio, hauing lost a sonne, a sonne, A country, house, crowne, sonne. O lares, misereri lares. Which shall I first deplore? My sonne, my sonne, My deare sweete boy, my deare Antonio. Ant. Antonio? And. I, eccho, I; I meane Antonio. Ant. Antonio, who meanes Antonio? And. Where art? what art? know'st thou Antonio? Ant. Yes. And. Liues hee? Ant. No. And. Where lies hee deade? Ant. Here. And. Where? Ant. Here. Andr. Art thou Antonio? Ant. I thinke I am. And. Dost thou but think? What, dost not know thy selfe? Ant. He is a foole that thinks he knowes himselfe. And. Vpon thy faith to heauen, giue thy name. Ant. I were not worthy of Andrugio's blood, If I denied my name's Antonio. And. I were not worthy to be call'd thy father, If I denied my name Andrugio. And dost thou liue? O, let me kisse thy cheeke, And deaw thy browe with trickling drops of ioy. Now heauens will be done: for I haue liu'd To see my ioy, my sonne Antonio. Giue me thy hand; now fortune doe thy worst, His blood, that lapt thy spirit in the wombe, Thus (in his loue) will make his armes thy tombe. Ant. Blesse not the bodie with your twining armes, Which is accurst of heauen. O, what black sinne Hath bin committed by our auntient house, Whose scalding vengeance lights vpon our heads, That thus the world, and fortune casts vs out, As loathed obiects, ruines branded slaues. And. Doe not expostulate the heauens will: But, O, remember to forget thy felfe: Forget remembrance what thou once hast bin. Come, creepe with me from out this open ayre. Euen trees haue tongues, and will betray our life. I am a raising of our house, my boy: Which fortune will not enuie, tis so meane, And like the world (all durt) there shalt thou rippe The inwards of thy fortunes, in mine eares, Whilst I sit weeping, blinde with passions teares: Then ile begin, and weele such order keepe, That one shall still tell greefes, the other weepe. Exit Andrugio, leauing Antonio, and his Page. Ant. Ile follow you. Boy, pree thee stay a little. Thou hast had a good voice, if this colde marshe, Wherein we lurke, haue not corrupted it. Enter Mellida, standing out of sight, in her Pages suite. I pree thee sing, but sirra (marke you me) Let each note breath the heart of passion, The sad extracture of extreamest griefe. Make me a straine; speake, groning like a bell, That towles departing soules. Breath me a point that may inforce me weepe, To wring my hands, to breake my cursed breast, Raue, and exclaime, lie groueling on the earth, Straight start vp frantick, crying, Mellida. Sing but, Antonio hath lost Mellida, And thou shalt see mee (like a man possest) Howle out such passion, that euen this brinish marsh Will squease out teares, from out his spungy cheekes, The rocks euen groane, and Pree thee, pree thee sing: Or I shall nere ha done when I am in. Tis harder for me end, then to begin. The boy runnes a note, Antonio breakes it. For looke thee boy, my griefe that hath no end, I may begin to playne, but pree thee sing. CANTANT. Mell. Heauen keepe you sir. An. Heauen keepe you from me, sir. Mell. I must be acquainted with you, sir. Ant. Wherefore? Art thou infected with misery, Sear'd with the anguish of calamitie? Art thou true sorrow, hearty griefe, canst weepe? I am not for thee if thou canst not raue, Antonio fals on the ground. Fall flat on the ground, and thus exclaime on heauen; O trifling Nature, why enspiredst thou breath Mell. Stay sir, I thinke you named Mellida. Ant. Know'st thou Mellida? Mel. Yes. Ant. Hast thou seene Mellida? Mell. Yes. Ant. Then hast thou seene the glory of her sex, The musick of Nature, the vnequall'd lustre Of vnmatched excellence, the vnited sweete Of heauens graces, the most adored beautie, That euer strooke amazement in the world. Mell. You seeme to loue her. Ant. With my very soule. Mell. Shele not requite it: all her loue is fixt Vpon a gallant, on Antonio, The Duke of Genoas sonne. I was her Page: And often as I waited, she would sigh; O, deere Antonio; and to strengthen thought, Would clip my neck, and kisse, and kisse me thus. Therefore leaue louing her: fa, faith me thinks, Her beautie is not halfe so rauishing As you discourse of; she hath a freckled face, A lowe forehead, and a lumpish eye. Ant. O heauen, that I should heare such blasphemie. Boy, rogue, thou liest, and Spauento dell mio core dolce Mellida, Di graua morte restoro vero dolce Mellida, Celesta saluatrice sovrana Mellida Del mio sperar; trofeo vero Mellida. Mel. Diletta &amp; soaue anima mia Antonio, Godeuole belezza cortese Antonio. Signior mio &amp; virginal amore bell' Antonio Gusto delli mei sensi, car' Antonio. Ant. O suamisce il cor in vn soaue baccio, Mel. Murono i sensi nel desiato dessio: Ant. Nel Cielo puo lesser belta pia chiara. Mel. Nel mondo pol esser belta pia chiara? Ant. Dammi vn baccio da quella bocca beata, Bassiammi, coglier l'aura odorata Che in sua neggia in quello dolce labra. Mel. Dammi pimpero del tuo gradit' amore Che beame, cosempiterno honore, Cosi, cosi mi conuerra morir. Good, sweet, scout ore the marsh: for my heart trembls At euery little breath that strikes my eare, When thou returnest: and ile discourse How I deceiu'd the Court: then thou shall tell How thou escapt'st the watch: weele point our speech With amorous kissing, kissing c?maes, and euen suck The liquid breath from out each others lips. Ant. Dul clod, no man but such sweeet fauour clips. I goe, and yet my panting blood perswades me stay. Turne coward in her sight? away, away. I thinke confusion of Babell is falne vpon these louers, that they change their language; but I feare mee, my master hauing but fained the person of a woman, hath got their vnfained imperfection, and is growne double tongu'd: as for Mellida, she were no woman, if shee could not yeelde strange language. But howsoeuer, if I should sit in iudgement, tis an errour easier to be pardoned by the auditors, then excused by the authours; and yet some priuate respect may rebate the edge of the keener censure. Enter Piero, Castilio, Matzagente, Forobosco, Feliche, Galeatzo, Balurdo, and his Page, at another dore. Pie. This way shee took: search, my sweet gentlem?. How now Balurdo, canst thou meete with any body? Bal. As I am true gentleman, I made my horse sweat, that he hath nere a dry thread on him: and I can meete with no liuing creature, but men &amp; beastes, In good sadnesse, I would haue sworne I had seene Mellida euen now: for I sawe a thing stirre vnder a hedge, and I peep't, and I spyed a thing: and I peer'd, and I tweerd vnderneath: and truly a right wise man might haue beene deceiued: for it was Pie. What, in the name of heauen? Bal. A dun cowe. Fel. Sh'ad nere a kettle on her head? Pie. Boy, didst thou see a yong Lady passe this way? Gal. Why speake you not? Bal. Gods neakes, proud elfe, giue the Duke reuerence, stand bare with a Whogh! heauens blesse me: Mellida, Mellida. Pie. Where man, where? Balur. Turnd man, turnd man: women weare the breaches, loe here, Pie. Light and vnduteous! kneele not, peeuish elfe, Speake not, entreate not, shame vnto my house, Curse to my honour. Where's Antonio? Thou traitresse to my hate, what is he shipt For England now? well whimpering harlot, hence. Mell. Good father Pie. Good me no goods. Seest thou that sprightly youth? ere thou canst tearme to morrow morning old, thou shalt call him thy husband, Lord and loue. Mel. Ay me. Pie. Blirt on your ay mees, gard her safely hence. Drag her away, ile be your gard to night. Young Prince, mount vp your spirits, and prepare To solemnize your Nuptials eue with popme. Gal. The time is scant: now nimble wits appeare: PhÅbus begins gleame, the welkin's cleare. Exeunt all, but Balurdo and his Page. Bal. Now nimble wits appeare: ile my selfe appeare, Balurdo's selfe, that in quick wit doth surpasse, Will shew the substance of a compleat Dil. Asse, asse. Bal. Ile mount my courser, and most gallantly prick Dil. Gallantly prick is too long, and stands hardly in the verse, sir. Bal. Ile speake pure rime, and will so brauely pranke it, that ile tosse loue like a pranke, pranke it: a rime for pranke it? Dil. Blank it. Bal. That ile tosse loue, like a dogge in a blanket: ha ha, in deede law. I thinke, ha ha, I thinke ha ha, I think I shall tickle the Muses. And I strike it not deade, say, Balurdo, thou art an arrant sot. Dil. Balurdo, thou art an arrant sot. Enter Andrugio and Antonio wreathed together, Lucio. And. Now, come vnited force of chap-falne death: Come, power of fretting anguish, leaue distresse. O, thus infoulded, we haue breasts of proofe, Gainst all the venom'd stings of misery. Ant: Father, now I haue an antidote, Gainst all the poyson that the world can breath. My Mellida, my Mellida doth blesse This bleak waste with her presence. How now boy, Why dost thou weepe? alas, where's Mellida? Ant. Ay me, my Lord. And. A sodden horror doth inuade my blood, My sinewes tremble, and my panting heart Scuds round about my bosome to goe out, Dreading the assailant, horrid passion. O, be no tyrant, kill me with one blowe. Speake quickly, briefely boy. Pa. Her father found, and seis'd her, she is gone. And. Son, heat thy bloode, be not frose vp with grief. Courage, sweet boy, sinke not beneath the waight Of crushing mischiefe. O where's thy dantlesse heart Thy fathers spirit! I renounce thy blood, If thou forsake thy valour. Lu. See how his grief speakes in his slow-pac't steps: Alas, tis more than he can vtter, let him goe. Dumbe solitary path best sureth woe. And. Giue me my armes, my armour Lucio. Lu. Deare Lord, what means this rage, when lacking vse Scarce safes your life, will you in armour rise? And. Fortune feares valour, presseth cowardize. Lu. Then valour gets applause, when it hath place, And meanes to blaze it. And. Nunquam potest non esse. Lu. Patience, my Lord, may bring your ils some end. And. What patience, friend, can ruin'd hopes att?d? Come, let me die like old Andrugio: Worthy my birth. O blood-true-honour'd graues Are farre more blessed then base life of slaues. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS QVINTVS. Enter Balurdo, a Painter with two pictures, and Dildo. Bal. And are you a painter sir, can you drawe, can you drawe? Pay. Yes sir. Ba. Indeede lawe? now so can my fathers forehore horse. And are these the workmanshippe of your hands? Payn. I did lymne them. Bal. Lymne them? a good word, lymne them: whose picture is this? Anno Domini 1599. Beleeue mee, master Anno Domini was a good settled age when you lymn'd him. 1599. yeares old? Lets see the other. Etatis suÃ¦ 24. Bir Ladie he is somwhat younger. Belike master Etatis suÃ¦ was Anno Dominies sonne. Pa. Is not your master a Dil. He hath a little procliuitie to him Pa. Procliuitie, good youth? I thank you for your courtly procliuitie. Bal. Approach good sir. I did send for you to drawe me a deuise, an Imprezza, by Sinecdoche a Mott. By PhÅbus crymson taffata mantle, I thinke I speake as melodiously, looke you sir, how thinke you ont? I wold haue you paint mee, for my deuice, a good fat legge of ewe mutton, swimming in stewde broth of plummes (boy keele your mouth, it runnes ouer) and the word shall be; Holde my dish, whilst I spill my pottage. Sure, in my conscience, twould be the most sweete deuice, now. Pa. Twould sent of kitchin-stuffe too much. Bal. Gods neakes, now I remember mee, I ha the rarest deuise in my head that euer breathed. Can you paint me a driueling reeling song, &amp; let the word be, Vh. Payn. A belch. Bal. O, no no: Vh, paint me vh, or nothing. Pay. It can not be done sir, but by a seeming kinde of drunkennesse. Bal. No? well, let me haue a good maffie ring, with your owne poesie grauen in it, that must sing a small trebble, worde for word, thus; And if you will my true louer be, Come followe mee to the greene wodde. Pa. O Lord, sir, I can not make a picture sing. B. Why? z'lid, I haue seen painted things sing as sweet: But I hau't will tickle it, for a conceipt ifaith. Enter Feliche, and Alberto. Alb. O deare Feliche, giue me thy deuice. How shall I purchase loue of Rossaline? Fel. S'will, flatter her soundly. Alb. Her loue is such, I can not flatter her: But with my vtmost vehemence of speach, I haue ador'd her beauties. Fel. Hast writ good mouing vnaffected rimes to her. Alb. O, yes, Feliche, but she scornes my writ. Fel. Hast thou presented her with sumptuous gifts? Alb. Alas, my fortunes are too weake to offer them. Fell. O, then I haue it, ile tell thee what to doe. Alb. What, good Feliche? Fel. Goe and hang thy selfe, I say, goe hang thy selfe, If that thou canst not giue, goe hang thy selfe: Ile rime thee dead, or verse thee to the rope. How thinkst thou of a Poet that sung thus; Munera sola pacant, sola addunt muner a formam: Munere solicites Pallada, Cypris erit. Munera, munera. Alb. Ile goe and breath my woes vnto the rocks, And spend my griefe vpon the deafest seas. Ile weepe my passion to the senselesse trees, And load most solitarie ayre with plaints. For wods, trees, sea, or rocky Appenine, Is not so ruthlesse as my Rossaline. Farewell deare friend, expect no more of mee, Here ends my part, in this loues Comedy. Exit Alb. Exit Paynter. Fel. Now master Balurdo, whether are you going, ha? Bal. Signior Feliche, how doe you faith, &amp; by my troth, how doe you? Fel. Whether art thou going, bully? Bal. And as heauen helpe mee, how doe you? How, doe you ifaith he? Fel. Whether art going man? Ball. O god, to the Court, ile be willing to giue you grace and good countnance, if I may but see you in the presence. Fel. O to court? farewell. Bal. If you see one in a yellow taffata dubblet, cut vpon carnation valure, a greene hat, a blewe paire of veluet hose, a gilt rapier, and an orenge tauny pair of worsted silke stockings, thats I, thats I. Fel. Very good, farewell. Bal. Ho, you shall knowe me as easily, I ha bought mee a newe greene feather with a red sprig, you shall see my wrought shirt hang out at my breeches, you shall know me. Fel. Very good, very good, farewell. Ball. Marrie in the maske twill be somewhat harde. But if you heare any bodie speake so wittily, that hee makes all the roome laugh; that's I, that's I. Farewell good Signior. Enter Forobosco, Castilio, a boy carying a gilt harpe: Piero, Mellida in night apparrell, Rossaline, Flauia, two Pages. Pier. Aduance the musiques prize, now capring wits, Rise to your highest mount; let choyce delight Garland the browe of this tryumphant night. Sfoote, a sits like Lucifer himselfe. Rossa. Good sweete Duke, first let their voyces strain for musicks price. Giue mee the golden harpe: faith with your fauour, ile be vmperesse. Pi. Sweet neece c?tent: boyes cleare your voice &amp; sing. 1. CANTAT. Rossa. By this gould, I had rather haue a seruant with a short nose, and a thinne haire, then haue such a high stretcht minikin voice. Pie. Faire neece, your reason? Ross. By the sweete of loue, I should feare extreamely that he were an Eunuch. Cast. Sparke spirit, how like you his voice? Ross. Spark spirit, how like you his voice? So helpe me, youth, thy voice squeakes like a dry cork shoe: come, come, lets heare the next. 2. CANTAT. Pie. Trust me, a good strong meane, Well sung my boy. Enter Balurdo. Bal. Hold, hold, hold: are yee blind, could you not see my voice comming for the harpe. And I knock not diuision on the head, take hence the harpe, make mee a slip, and let me goe but for nine pence. Sir Marke, strike vp for master Balurdo. 3. CANTAT. Iudgem?t gentlemen, iudgem?t. Wast not aboue line? I appeale to your mouthes that heard my song. Doe me right, and dub me knight Balurdo. Ros. Kneele downe, and ile dub thee knight of the golden harpe. Ba. Indeed law, doe, and ile make you Ladie of the siluer fiddlestick, Ross. Come, kneele, kneele. Enter a Page to Balurdo, Bal. My troth, I thank you, it hath neuer a whistle in'tâ Ro. Naie, good sweet cuz raise vp your drooping eies, &amp; I were at the point of To haue &amp; to hold, from this day forward, I would be asham'd to looke thus lumpish. What my prettie Cuz, tis but the losse of an od maidenhead: shall's daunce? thou art so sad, harke in mine eare. I was about to say, but ile forbeare. Ba. I come, I come, more then most hunny-suckle sweete Ladies, pine not for my presence, ile returne in pompe. Well spoke sir Ieffrey Balurdo. As I am a true knight, I feele honourable eloquence begin to grope mee alreadie. Exit. Pie. Faith, mad neece, I wonder when thou wilt marrie? Rossa. Faith, kinde vncle, when men abandon ielosy, forsake taking of Tobacco, and cease to weare their beardes so rudely long. Oh, to haue a husband with a mouth continually smoaking, with a bush of furs on the ridge of his chinne, readie still to slop into his foming chaps; ah, tis more than most intollerable. Pier. Nay faith, sweete neece, I was mightie strong in thought we should haue shut vp night with an ould Comedie: the Prince of Millane shall haue Mellida, &amp; thou shouldst haue Ros. No bodie, good sweete vncle. I tell you, sir, I haue 39. seruants, and my munkey that makes the fortieth. Now I loue al of them lightly for something, but affect none of them seriously for any thing. One's a passionate foole, and hee flatters mee aboue beliefe: the second's a teastie ape, and hee railes at me beyond reason: the third's as graue as some Censor, and hee strokes vp his mustachoes three times, and makes six plots of set faces, before he speakes one wise word: the fourth's as dry, as the burre of an heartichoke; the fifth paints, and hath alwaies a good colour for what hee speakes: the sixt Pie. Stay, stay, sweet neece, what makes you thus suspect young gallants worth. Ross. Oh, when I see one were a perewig, I dreade his haire; another wallowe in a great sloppe, I mistrust the proportion of his thigh; and wears a ruffled boot, I feare the fashion of his legge. Thus, something in each thing, one tricke in euery thing makes me mistrust imperfection in all parts; and there's the full point of my addiction. The Cornets sound a cynet. Enter Galeatzo, Matzagente, and Balurdo in maskery. Pier. The roome's too scant: boyes, stand in there, close. Mel. In faith, faire sir, I am too sad to daunce. Pie. How's that, how's that? too sad? By heauen dance, And grace him to, or, goe to, I say no more. Mell. A burning glasse, the word splendente PhÅbo? Tis too curious, I conceipt it not. Gal. Faith, ile tel thee. Ile no longer burne, then youle shine and smile vpon my loue. For looke yee fairest, by your pure sweets, I doe not dote vpon your excellence. And faith, vnlesse you shed your brightest beames Of sunny fauour, and acceptiue grace Vpon my tender loue, I doe not burne: Marry but shine, and ile reflect your beames, with feruent ardor. Faith I wold be loath to flatter thee faire soule, because I loue, not doat, court like thy husband; which thy father sweares, to morrowe morne I must be. This is all, and now from henceforth, trust me Mellida, Ile not speake one wise word to thee more. Mell. I trust yee. Gal. By my troth, Ile speak pure foole to thee now. Mel. You will speake the liker your selfe. Gal. Good faith, Ile accept of the cockescombe, so you will not refuse the bable. Mel. Nay good sweet, keepe them both, I am enamour'd of neither. Gal. Goe to, I must take you downe for this. Lende me your eare. Ros. A glowe worme, the word? Splendescit tantÃ¹m tenebris. Matz. O, Ladie, the glowe worme figurates my valour: which shineth brightest in most darke, dismall and horrid atchieuements. Ross. Or rather, your glowe worme represents your wit, which only seems to haue fire in it, though indeed tis but an ignis fatuus, and shines onely in the darke deade night of fooles admiration. Matz. Ladie, my wit hath spurs, if it were dispos'd to ride you. Ross. Faith sir, your wits spurs haue but walking rowels; dull, blunt, they will not drawe blood: the gentlemen vshers may admit them the Presence, for anie wrong they can doe to Ladies. Bal. Truely, I haue strained a note aboue Ela, for a deuise; looke you, tis a faire rul'd singing booke: the word, Perfect, if it were prickt. Fla. Though you are mask't, I can guesse who you are by your wit. You are not the exquisite Balurdo, the most rarely shap't Balurdo. Ba. Who, I? No I am not sir Ieffrey Balurdo. I am not as well knowne by my wit, as an alehouse by a red lattice. I am not worthy to loue and be belou'd of Flauia, Fla. I will not scorne to fauour such good parts, as are applauded in your rarest selfe. Bal. Truely, you speake wisely, and like a Iantlewoman of foureteene yeares of age. You know the stone called lapis; the nearer it comes to the fire, the hotter it is: and the bird, which the Geometricians cal Auis, the farther it is from the earth, the nearer it is to the heauen: and loue, the nigher it is to the flame, the more remote (ther's a word, remote) the more remote it is from the frost, Your wit is quicke, a little thinge pleaseth a young Ladie, and a smal fauour contenteth an ould Courtier; and so, sweete mistresse I trusse my codpeece point. Enter Feliche. Pier. What might import this florish? bring vs word. Fel. Stand away: here's such a companie of flibotes, hulling about this galleasse of greatnesse, that there's no boarding him. Doe you heare yon thing call'd, Duke? Pie. How now blunt Feliche, what's the newes? Fel. Yonder's a knight, hath brought Andrugio's head, &amp; craues admittance to your chaire of state. Cornets sound a Cynet: enter Andrugio in armour. Pie. Conduct him with attendance sumptuous, Sound all the pleasing instruments of ioy: Make tryumph, stand on tiptoe whil'st wee meete: O sight most gratious, o reuenge most sweete! And. We vowe, by the honour of our birth, to recompence any man that bringeth Andrugio's head, with twentie thousand double Pistolets, and the endeering to our choysest loue. Pie. We still with most vnmou'd resolu'd confirme Our large munificence: and here breath A sad and solemne protestation: When I recall this vowe, O, let our house Be euen commaunded, staind, and trampled on, As worthlesse rubbish of nobilitie. And. Then, here, Piero, is Andrugios head, Royally casked in a helme of steele: Giue me thy loue, and take it. My dauntlesse soule Hath that vnbounded vigor in his spirits, That it can beare more ranke indignitie, With lesse impatience, then thy cancred hate Can sting and venome his vntainted worth, With the most viperous sound of malice. Strike; O, let no glimse of honour light thy thoughts, If there be any heat of royall breath Creeping in thy vaines, O stifle it. Be still thy selfe, bloodie and trecherous. Fame not thy house with an admired acte Of princely pittie. Piero, I am come, To soyle thy house with an eternall blot Of sauage crueltie; strike, or bid me strike. I pray my death; that thy nere dying shame Might liue immortall to posteritie. Come, be a princely hangman, stoppe my breath. O dread thou shame, no more then I dread death. Pie. We are amaz'd, our royall spirits numm'd, In stiffe astonisht wonder at thy prowesse, Most mightie, valiant, and high towring heart. We blush, and turne our hate vpon our selues, For hating such an vnpeer'd excellence. I ioy my state: him whome I loath'd before, That now I honour, loue; nay more, adore. The still Flutes sound a mournfull Cynet. Enter a Cofin. But stay: what tragick spectacle appeares, Whose bodie beare you in that mournefull hearse? Lu. The breathlesse trunke of young Antonio. Mell. Antonio (aye me) my Lord, my loue, my And. Sweete pretious issue of most honor'd blood, Rich hope, ripe vertue, O vntimely losse. Come hither friend. Pree thee doe not weepe: Why, I am glad hee's deade, he shall not see His fathers vanquisht, by his enemie. Euen in princely honour, nay pree thee speake. How dy'd the wretched boy? Lu. My Lord And. I hope he dyed yet like my sonne, ifaith. Lu. Alas, my Lord And. He died vnforst, I trust, and valiantly. Lu. Poore gentleman, being And. Did his hand shake, or his eye looke dull, His thoughts reele, fearefull when he struck the stroke? And if they did, Ile rend them out the hearse, Rip vp his cearecloth, mangle his bleake face; That when he comes to heauen, the powers diuino Shall nere take notice that he was my sonne. Ile quite disclaime his birth: nay pree thee speake: And twere not hoopt with steel, my brest wold break. Mel. O that my spirit in a sigh could mount, Into the Spheare, where thy sweet soule doth rest. Pie. O that my teares, bedeawing thy wan cheeke, Could make new spirit sprout in thy could blood. Bal. Verely, he lookes as pittifully, as a poore Iohn: as I am true knight, I could weepe like a ston'd horse. And. Villaine, tis thou hast murdred my sonne. Thy vnrelenting spirit (thou black dogge, That took'st no passion of his fatall loue) Hath forst him giue his life vntimely end. Pie. Oh that my life, her loue, my dearest blood Would but redeeme one minute of his breath. Ant. I seize that breath. St?d not amaz'd great states: I rise from death, that neuer liu'd till now. Piero, keepe thy vowe, and I enioy More vnexpressed height of happinesse, Then power of thought can reach: if not, loe here There stands my toumbe, and here a pleasing stage: Most wisht spectators of my Tragedie, To this end haue I fain'd, that her faire eye, For whome I liu'd, might blesse me ere I die. Mell, Can breath depaint my vnc?ceiued thoughts? Can words describe my infinite delight, Of seeing thee, my Lord Antonio? O no; conceipt, breath, passion, words be dumbe, Whil'st I instill the deawe of my sweete blisse, In the soft pressure of a melting kisse; Sic, sic iuuat ire sub vmbras. Pie. Faire sonne (now Ile be proud to call thee sonne) Enioy me thus; my verie breast is thine: Possesse me freely, I am wholly thine. Ant, Deare father. And. Sweet son, sweet son; I can speake no more: My ioyes passion flowes aboue the shoare, And choakes the current of my speach. Pie. Young Florence prince, to you my lips must beg, For a remittance of your interest. Gal. In your faire daughter, with all my thought, So helpe me faith, the naked truth Ile vnfold; He that was nere hot, will soone be cold, Pie. No man els makes claime vnto her. Matz. The valiant speake truth in briefe: no Bal. Trulie, for sir Ieffrey Balurdo, he disclaimes to haue had anie thing in her, Pie. Then here I giue her to Antonio. Royall, valiant, most respected prince, Let's clippe our hands; Ile thus obserue my vowe; I promis'd twentie thousand double Pistolets, With the indeering to my dearest loue, To him that brought thy head; thine be the golde, To solemnize our houses vnitie: My loue be thine, the all I haue be thine. Fill vs fresh wine, the forme weele take by this: Weele drinke a health, while they two sip a kisse. Now, there remaines no discord that can sound Harsh accents to the eare of our accord: So please your neece to match. Ross. Troth vncle, when my sweet fac't cuz hath tolde me how she likes the thing, call'd wedlock; may be Ile take a suruey of the checkroll of my seruants; &amp; he that hath the best parts of, Ile pricke him downe for my husband. Bal. For passion of loue now, remember me to my mistresse, Lady Rossaline, when she is pricking down the good parts of her seruants. As I am true knight, I grow stiffe: I shall carry it. Pie. I will. Sound Lidian wires, once make a pleasing note, On Nectar streames of your sweete ayres, to flote. Ant. Here ends the comick crosses of true loue: Oh may the passage most succesfull proue. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogus. Gentlemen, though I remaine an armed Epilogue, I stand not as a peremptory chalenger of desert, either for him that composed the Comedy, or for vs that acted it: but a most submissiue supplyant for both. What imperfection you haue seene in vs, leaue with vs, &amp; weele amend it; what hath pleased you, take with you, &amp; cherish it. You shall not be more ready to embrace any thing c?mendable, then we will endeauour to amend all things reproueable. What we are, is by your fauour. What we shall be, rests all in your applausiue incouragements. Exit.</field>
