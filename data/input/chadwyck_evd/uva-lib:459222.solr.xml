      <field name="fulltext">DILIGENCE. The Father and founder of saith and felicitie, That zour fassioun formed to his similitude And his Sone our Sauiour scheild in necessitie, That bocht zow from baillis ranson rude, Repleadgeand his presonaris with his hart-blude The halie Gaist gouernour and grounder of grace Of wisdome and weilfair baith fontaine and flude, Gifzow all that I sie seasit in this place, And scheild zow from sinne. And with his Spreit zow inspyre Till I haue shaw in my desyre Silence Soueraine I requyre For now I begin. Tak tent to me my freinds and hald zow coy, For I am sent to zow as messingeir, From ane nobill and rycht redoubtit Roy: The quhill hes bene absent this monie zeir, Humanitie giue ze his name wald speir: Quha bade me shaw to zow but variance, That he intendis amang zow to compeir, VVith ane triumph and awfull ordinance: VVith crown and sword and scepter in his hand, Temper it with mercie quhen penitence appeiris: Howbeit that hee lang tyme hes bene sleipand, Quhair throw misreull hes rung thir monie zeiris: That innocentis hes bene brocht on thair beiris, Be fals reporteris of this natioun: Thocht zoung oppressouris at the elder leiris, Be now assurit of reformatioun. Sie no misdoeris be sa bauld, As to remaine into this hauld: For quhy be him that Iudas sauld Thay will be heich hangit. Now faithfull folk for ioy may sing: For quhy it is the iust bidding Of my soveraine lord the king That na man be wrang it. Thocht he ane quhyll into his flouris Be gouernit be vylde trompouris: And sumtyme lufe his paramouris, Hauld ze him excusit. For quhen he meittis with Correctioun, VVith Veritie and Discretioun, Thay will be banisched aff the toun, Quhilk hes him abusit. And heir be oppin proclamatioun, I wairne in name of his magnificence, The thrie estaitis of this natioun, That thay compeir with detfull diligence: And till his grace mak thair obedience. And first I wairne the Spritualitie, And sie the burgessis spair not for expence: Bot speid thame heir with Temporalitie. Als I beseik zow famous auditouris, Conveinit in this congregatioun, To be patient the space of certaine houris, Till ze haue hard our short narratioun. And als we makzow supplicatioun, That na man tak our wordis intill disdaine: Althocht zehear be declamatioun, The common-weill richt pitiouslie complaine. Rycht so the verteous ladie Veritie, VVill mak ane pitious lamentatioun: Als for the treuth sho will impresonit be, And banischit lang tyme out of the toun: And Chastitie will mak narratioun, How sho can get na ludging in this land, Till that the heauinlie king Correctioun, Meit with the king and commoun hand for hand. Prudent peopill I pray zow all, Tak na man greif in speciall: For wee sall speik in generall, For pastyme and for play. Thairfoir till all our rymis be rung, And our mistoinit sangis be sung, Let euerie man keip weill ane toung, And euerie woman tway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rex Humanitas. O Lord of Lords and King of king is all, Omnipotent of power Prince but peir, Euer ring and in gloir Celestial Quha be great micht and haifing na mateir Maid heauin and eird, fyre, air and watter cleir: Send me thy grace with peace perpetuall, That I may rewll my realme to thy pleaseir, Syne bring my saull to ioy angelicall. Sen thow hes giuin mee dominatioun And rewll of pepill subiect to my cure, Be I nocht rewIit be counsall and ressoun, In dignitie I may nocht lang indure. I grant my stait my self may nocht assure Nor zit conserue my lyfe in sickernes: Haue pitie Lord on mee thy creature Supportand me in all my busines. I thee requeist quha rent was on the Rude, Me to defend from the deids of defame: That my pepill report of me bot gude, And be my saifgaird baith from sin and shame. I knaw my dayis induris bot as ane dreame, Thairfoir O Lord I hairtlie the exhort, To gif me grace to vse my diadeame To thy pleasure and to my great comfort. Wantonnes. My Soueraine Lord and Prince but peir, Quhat garris zow mak sic dreirie cheir? Be blyth sa lang as zear heir, And pas tyme with pleasure: For als lang leifis the mirrie man, As the sorie for ocht he can: His banis full sair Sir sall I ban That dois zow displeasure. Sa lang as Placebo and I, Remaines into zour company, Zour grace sall leif richt mirrely: Of this haifze na dout. Sa lang as ze haue vs in cure: Zour grace sir sall want na pleasure: VVar Solace heir Izow assure, He wald reioyce this rout. Placebo. Gude brother myne quhair is Solace The mirrour of all mirrines, I haue great meruell be the Mes He taries sa lang. Byde he away wee ar bot shent, I ferlie how he fra vs went: I trow he hes impediment That lettis him nocht gang. Wantonnes. I left Solace that same greit loun Drink and into the burrows toun, It will cost him halfe of ane croun, Althocht ze had na mair. And als he said hee wald gang see Fair ladie sensualitie, The buriall of all bewtie And portratour preclair. Placebo. Be God I see him at the last As he war chaist rynnand richt fast, He glowris euin as he war agast Or feyit of ane gaist. Na, he is wod drunkin I trow, Se ze not that he is wod fow: I ken weill be his creischie mow He hes bene at ane feast. Solace, Now quha saw euer sic ane thrang? Me thocht sum said I had gaine wrang, Had I help I wald sing ane sang With ane rycht mirrie noyse. I haue sic pleasour at my hart, That garris me sing the troubill pairt: Wald sum gude fallow fill the guart. It wald my hairt reioyce. Howbeit my coat be short and nippit, Thankis be to God I am weill hippit Thocht all my gold may shone be grippit Intill ane pennie pursse. Thocht I ane seruand lang haif bene, My purchais is nocht worth ane preine: I may sing Peblis on the greine For ocht that I may tursse. Quhat is my name can ze not gesse, Sirs ken ze nocht Sandie solace? Thay callit my mother bonie Besse That dwelt betwene the bowis. Of twelf zeir auld sho learnit to swyfe, Thankit be the great God on lyue: Scho maid me father is four or fyue, But dout this is na mowis. Quhen ane was deid sho gat ane vther, Was never man had sic ane mother: Of father is sho maid me ane futher, Of lawit men and leirit: Scho is baith wyse, worthie and wicht, For scho spairis nouther kuik nor knycht: Zea four and twentie on ane nicht, And ay thair eine scho bleirit. And gif I lie sirs ze may speir: Bot saw ze nocht the King cum heir? I am ane sportour and playfeir To that Royall zoung King: He said he wald within schort space Cum pas his tyme into this place: I pray the Lord to send him grace, That he lang tyme may ring. Placebo. Solace quhy taryit ze sa lang? Solace. The feind a faster I micht gang: I micht not thrist out throw the thrang, Of wyfes fyftein fidder: Then for to rin I tuik ane rink, Bot I felt neuer sik ane stink: For our lordis luif gif me ane drink, Placebo my deir brother. Rex Hu. My servant Solace quhat gart zow tarie? Solace. I wait not sir be sweit saint Marie, I haue bene in ane feirie farie Or ellis intill ane trance: Sir I haue sene I zow assure The fairest earthlie creature, That ever was formit be nature And maist for to advance. To luik on hir is great delyte, With lippis reid and cheikis quhyte I wald renunce all this warld quyte For till stand in hir grace: Scho is wantoun and scho is wyse: And cled scho is on the new gyse, It wald garall zour flesche vp ryse To luik vpon hir face. War I ane king it sould be kend, I sould not spair on hir to spend: And this same nicht for hir to send, For my pleasure: Quhat rak of zour prosperitie, Gif ze want Sensualitie? I wald nocht gif ane sillie flie, For zour treasure. Rex. Forsuith my freinds I think ze ar not wyse, Till counsall me to break commandement Direct it be the Prince of Paradyce: Considering ze knaw that my intent Is for till be to God obedient, Quhilk dois forbid men to be lecherous: Do I nocht sa perchance I will repeat, Thairfoir I think zour counsall odious. The quhilk ze gaif mee till. Becaus I haue bene to this day Tanquam tabula rasa: That is als mekill as to say. Redie for gude and ill. Placebo. Beleiue ze that we will begyll zow, Or from zour vertew we will wyle zow, Or with euill counsall overseyll zow, Both into gude and euill: To tak zour graces part wee grant In all zour deidis participant, Sa that ze be nocht ane zoung sanct And syne ane auld deuill. Wanton. Beleiue ze Sir that Lecherie be sin, Na trow nocht that, this is my ressoun quhy, First at the Romane Kirk will ze begin Quhilk is the lemand lamp of lechery: Quhair Cardinals and Bischops generally To luif Ladies thay think ane pleasant sport, And out of Rome hes baneist Chastity Quha with our Prelats can get na resort. Solace. Sir quhill ze get ane prudent Queine, I think zour Maiestie serein Sould haue ane lustie Concubein, To play zow withall: For I knaw be zour qualitie, Ze want the gift of chastitie Fall to in nomine Domins, This is my counsall. I speik Sir vnder protestatioun, That nane at me haif indignatioun: For all the Prelats of this natioun, For the maist part: Thay think na schame to haue ane huir, And sum hes thrie vnder thair cuir: This to be trew Ile zow assuir Ze sall heir efterwart. Sir knew all the mater throch To playze wald begin Speir at the Monks of Bamirrinoch, Giflecherie be sin. Placebo. Sir send ze for Sandie solace, Or ells zour monzeoun Wantonnes, And pray my Ladie Priores, The suith till declair: Gif it be sin to tak Kaity, Or to leif like ane bummill baty The buik sayis Omnia prebate And nocht for to spair. Sensualitie. Luifers awalk behald the fyrie spheir, Behauld the naturall dochter of Venus: Behauld luifers this lustie Ladie cleir The fresche fonteine of Knicht is amorous Repleit with ioyis dulce and delicious: Or quha wald mak to Venus observance? In my mirthfull chalmer melodious. Thair sall thay find all pastyme and pleasance. Behauld my heid behauld my gay attyre, Behauld my halfe lusum and lilie quhite: Behauld my visage flammand as the fyre Behauld my papis of portratour perfyte. To luke on mee luiffers hes greit delyte, Rycht sa hes all the Kinges of Christindome: To thame I haif done pleasouris infinite, And speciallie vnto the Court of Rome. Ane kis of me war worth in ane morning A milzioun of gold to Knicht or King. And zit I am of nature sa towart I lat no luiffer pas with ane sair hart. Of my name wald ze wit the veritie, Forsuith thay call me Sensualitie. I hauld it best now or we farther gang, To Dame Venus let vs go sing ane sang. Hamelines. Madame but tarying, For to serue Venus deir, VVe sall fall to and sing, Sister Danger cum neir. Danger. Sister I was nocht sweir To Venus observance, Howbeit I mak Dangeir: Zit be continuance, Men may haue thair pleasance: Thairfoir let na man fray, We will tak it perchance, Howbeit that wee say nay. Hamelines. Sister cum on zour way, And let vs nocht think lang: In all the haist wee may, To sing Venus ane sang. Danger. Sister sing this sang I may not, Without the help of gude Fund-Ionet: Fund-Ionet, hoaw cum tak a part. Fund-Ionet. That fall I do with all my hart: Sister howbeit that I am hais, I am content to beir a bais. Ze twa sould luif me as zour lyfe, Ze knaw I lernit zow baith to swyfe: In my chalmer ze wait weill quhair, Sen syne the feind ane man ze spair. Hamelines. Fund-Ionet, fy, ze ar to blame, To speik foull wordis think ze not schame? Fund Ionet. Thair is ane hundreth heir sit and by That luifis geaping als weill as I, Micht thay get it in priuitie: Bot quha begins the sang let se. Rex.

Immortall God maist of magnificence, Quhais Maiestie na Clark can comprehend: Must saue zow all that giuis sic audience, And grant zow grace him never till offend, Quhilk on the Croce did willing lie ascend, And sched his pretious blude on everie side: Quhais pitious passioun from 'danger zow defend, And be zour gratious governour and gyde. Now my gude freinds considder I zow beseik The caus maist principall of my cumming, Princis or Potestatis ar nocht worth ane leik, Be thay not gydit be my gude gouerning: Thair was never Empriour, Conquerour nor King, Without my wisdome that micht thair wil avance, My name is Gude Counsall without feinzeing, Lords for lack of my lair at brocht to mischance. Finallie for conclusioun, Quha halds me at delusioun: Sall be brocht to confusioun: And this I vnderstand, For I haue maid my residence, With hie Princes of greit puissance, In Ingland, Italie and France, And monie vther Land.

Wee thank zow freinds of zour benevolence, It sall be done evin as ze haue devysit: Wee think ze serue ane gudlie recompence, Defendand vs that wee be nocht supprysit. In this mater wee man be weill aduysit, Now quhill the King misknawis the veritie, Be scho ressauit then wee will be deprysit, Quhat is zour counsell brother now let se? Abbot. I hauld it best that wee incontinent, Gar hauld hir fast into Captivitie: Vnto the thrid day of the Parlament And then accuse hir of hir herisie: Or than banische hir out of this cuntrie, For with the King gif Veritie be knawin: Of our greit gloir wee will degradit be And all our secreits to the commouns schawin. Persone. Zese the King is zit effeminate, And gydit be Dame Sensualitie, Rycht sa with zoung counsall intoxicate, Swa at this tyme ze haif zour libertie. To tak zour tyme I hauld it best for me, And go distroy all thir Lutherians: In speciall zon ladie Veritie, Spirituali. Schir Persone ze sall be my commissair, To put this mater till executioun, And ze sir Freir, becaus ze can declair The haill processe, pas with him in commissioun, Pas all togidder with my braid bennisoun, And gif scho speiks against our libertie, Then put hir in perpetuall presoun, That scho cum nocht to King Humanitie. Heir sall thay pas to Verity. Persone. Lustie Ladie we wald faine vnderstand, Quhat earand ze haif in this Regioun? To preich or teich quha gaif to zow command, To counsall Kingis how gat ze commissioun?

For our christs saik I am richt weill content To suffer all thing that sall pleis his grace, Howbeit ze put ane thousand to torment, Ten hundreth thowsand sall rise into thair place. Veritie sits doun on hir knies and sayis. Get vp, thow, thow sleipis all too lang, O Lord, And mak sum ressonabill reformatioun On them that dois tramp doun thy gracious word, And hes ane deidlie indignatioun At them quha maks maist trew narratioun: Suffer me not Lord, mair to be molest, Gude Lord, I mak the supplicatioun With thy vnfreinds let me nocht be supprest: Now Lords do as ze list, I haue na mair to say.

My Lord wee haue with diligence Bucklit vp weill zon bledrand baird: Spritualitie. I think ze serue gude recompence, Tak thirten crowns for zour rewaird. Verity. The Prophesie of the Propheit Esay Is practickit alace, on mee this day: Quha said the veritie sould be trampit doun Amid the streit, and put in strang presoun. His fyue and fyftie chapter quha list luik, Sall find thir words writtin in his Buik. Richt sa Sanct Paull wrytis to Timothie, That men sall turne thair earis from veritie. Bot in my Lord God I haue esperance, He will provide for my deliverance.

Then pas to ladies of Religioun, Quhilk maks thair vow to obserue Chastitie: Lo quhair thair sits ane Priores of renown, Amangs the rest of Spritualitie. Chastitie. I grant zon Ladie hes vowit Chastitie, For hir professioun thairto sould accord: Scho maid that vow for ane Abesie, Bot nocht for Christ Iesus our Lord. Fra tyme that thay get thair vows, I stand for'd, Thay banische hir out of thair cumpanie, With Chastitie thay can mak na concord Bot leids thair lyfis in Sensualitie, I sall obserue zour counsall gif I may, Cum on and heir quhat zon Ladie will say? Chastitie passis to the Ladie Priores and sayis.

Or to Prelats mak zour progressioun, Quhilks ar obleist to zow als weill as I: Dame Sensuall hes geuin directioun Zow till exclude out of my cumpany. Chastitie. Gifze wald wit mair of the veritie, I sall schaw zow be sure experience, How that the Lords of Sprituality, Hes baneist me, alace, fra thair presence. Chastitie passes to the Lords of Spritualitie, My Lords, laud, gloir, triumph and reverence, Mot be vnto zour halie Sprituall stait: I zow beseik of zour benevolence, To harbry mee that am sa desolait.

God furth of heavin hes him send, To punische all that dois offend Against his Maiestie As lyks him best to tak vengence, Sumtyme with Sword and Pestilence With derth and povertie. Bot quhen the peopill dois repent, And beis to God obedient, Then will he gif them grace: Bot thay that will nocht be correctir, Rycht sudanlie will be deiectir, And fleimit from his face.

Divyne Correctioun. Beati qui esuriunt &amp; sitiunt Iustitiam. Thir ar the words of the redoutit Roy, The Prince of peace aboue all Kings King: Quhilk hes me sent all cuntries to convoye, And all misdoars dourlie to doun thring. I will do nocht without the conveining Ane Parleament of the estaits all, In thair presence I sall but seinzeing Iniquitie vnder my Sword doun thrall. Thair may no Prince do acts honorabill, Bot gif his counsall thairto will assist: How may he knaw the thing maist profitabil, To follow vertew and vycis to resist: Without he be instructit and solist: And quhen the King stands at his counsell sound, Then welth sall wax and plentie as he list, And policie sall in his Realme abound. Gif ony list my name for till inquyre, I am callit Divine Correciovn: I fled throch mony vncouth land &amp; schyre, To the greit profit of ilk Natioun. Now am I cum into this Regioun, To teill the ground that hes bene lang vnsawin: To punische tyrants for thair transgressioun, And toc aus leill men liue vpon thair awin. Na Realme nor Land but my support may stand For I gar Kings liue into Royaltie: To rich and puir I beir ane equall band, That thay may liue into thair awin degrie. Quhair I am nocht is no tranqullitie Be me tratours and tyrants ar put doun: Quha thinks na schame of thair iniquitie Till thay be punisched be mee Correctioun. Quhat is ane King? nocht bot ane officiar, To caus his Leiges liue in equitie: And vnder God to be ane punischer, Of trespassours against his Maiestie. Bot quhen the King dois law in tyrannie, Break and Iustice for feare or affectioun: Then is his Realme weir in and povertie, With schamefull slauchter but correctioun. I am ane Iudge richt potent and seveir, Cum to do Iustice monie thowsand myle: I am sa constant baith in peice and weir, Na bud nor fauour may my sicht oversyle. Thair is thairfoir richt monie in this Ile, Of my repair but doubt that dois repent: Bot verteous men I traist sall on me smyle, And of my cumming sall be richt weill content. Welcum my Lord welcum then ten thowsand tyms Till all faithfull men of this Regioun, Welcum for till correct all falts and cryms: Amang this cankerd congregatioun. Louse Chastitie I mak supplicatioun, Put till fredome fair Ladie Veritie: Quha be vnfaithfull folk of this Natioun, Lyis bund fall fast into Captivitie. Correctioun. I mervel Gude-counsell how that may be, Ar ze nocht with the King familiar? Gude-counsell. That I am nocht my Lord full wais me, Bot lyke ane begger am halden at the bar: Thay play bo-keik evin as I war ane skar: Thair came thrie knaues in cleithing counterfeit And fra the King thay gart me stand affar. Quha s names war Flattrie, Falset and Dissait. Bot qu en thay knaues hard tell of zour cumming, Thay staw away ilk ane ane sindrie gait. And cuist fra them thair counterfit cleithing, For thair leuing full weill thay can debait: The merchandmen thay haif resauit Dissait, As for Falset, my Lord, full weill I ken, He will be richt weill treit it air and lait, Amang the maist part of the crafts men. Flattrie hes taine the habite of ane Freir Thinkand to begyll Spiritualitie Correctioun. But dout my freind and I liue half ane zeir I sall search out that great iniquitie. Quhair lyis zon Ladyes in Captiuitie? How now Sisters quha hes zow sa disgysit? Veritie. Vnfaithfull members of iniquitie, Dispytfullie, my Lord, hes vs supprysit. Correctioun. Gang put zon Ladyis to thair libertie Incontinent and break doun all the stocks: But doubt thay ar full deir welcum to mee, Mak diligence, me think ze do bot mocks Speid hand and spair nocht for to break the locks. And tenderlie tak them vp be the hand Had I them heir thay knaues suld ken my knocks That them opprest and baneist aff the land. Thay tak the Ladys furth of the stocks, and Veritie sall say. Veritie. Wee thank zou sir of zour benignitie, Bot I beseik zour maiestie Royall: That ze wald pas to King Humanitie. And fleime from him zon Ladie Sensuall, And enter in his service Gude-counsell, For ze will find him verie counsalabill. Correctioun. Cum on Sisters as ze haif said, I sall, And gar him stand with zow thrie firme and stabill, Correctioun passis towards the King with Veritie Chastitie and Gude-counsell. Wantonnes. Solace knawis thou not quhat I se? Ane knicht or ellis ane king thinks me, With wantoun wings as he wald fle, Brother quhat may this meine?

Zon is ane stranger I'stand forde, He semes to be ane listie Lord: Be his heir-cumming for concorde, And be kinde till our King. He sall be welcome to this place, And treatit with the Kingis grace: Be it nocht sa we fall him chace, And to the diuell him ding. Placebo. I reid vs put vpon the King, And walkin him of his sleiping: Sir, rise and se ane vncouth thing. Get vp, ze ly too lang. Sensualitie. Put on zour hude Iohne-Fule, ze raif, How dar ze be so pert sir knaif To tuich the King? sa Christ me saif, Fals huirsone thow sall hang. Correction. Get vp sir King, ze haif sleip it aneuch Into the armis of Ladie Sensual. Be suir that mair belangis to the pleuch, As efterward perchance rehears I sall. Remember how the King Sardanapall, Amang fair Ladyes tuke his lust sa lang, Sa that the maist pairt of his Leiges al Rebeld, and syne him duilfully doun thrang. Remember how into the tyme of Noy, For the foull stinck and sin of lechery, God be my wande did al the warld destroy, Sodome and Gomore richt sa full rigorously, For that vyld sin war brunt in maist cruelly.

Quha euer taks on him that kinglie cuir, To get ane of thirtwa he suld be suir: Great paine and labour, and that continuall, Or ellis to haue defame perpetuall.

And als I mak zow exhortatioun, Sen ze haifheard the first pairt of our play: Go tak ane drink, and mak Collatioun, Ilk man drink till his marrow, I zow pray. Tarie nocht lang, it is lait in the day, Let sum drink Ayle and sum drink Claret wine: Be great Doctors of Physick I heare say, That michtie drink comforts the dull ingine. Andze Ladies that list to pisch, Lift vp zour taill, plat in ane disch: And gif that zour mawkine cryis quhisch, Stop in ane wusp of stray. Let nocht zour bladder burst I pray zow, For that war euin aneuch to slay zow: For zit thair is to cum, I say zow, The best pairt of our Play. The End of the first part of the Satyre</field>

My worthy Lords sen ze haue taine on hand Sum reformatioun to mak into this land: And als ze knaw it is the Kings mynd, Quha till the Common-weil hes ay bene kynd: Thocht reif and thift wer stanchit weill aneuch, Zit sumthing mair belangis to the pleuch. Now into peace ze sould provyde for weirs, And be sure of how mony thowsand speirs, The King may be quhen he hes ocht ado, For quhy my Lords this is my ressoun to. The husband-men and commons thay war wont, Go in the battell formest in the front. Bot I haue tint all my experience, Without ze mak sum better diligence: The Common-weill mon vther wayis be styllit, Or be my faith the King wilbe be gyllit. Thir pure commouns daylie as ze may se, Declynisdoun till extreme poverrie: For sum ar hichtit sa into thair maill, Thair winning will nocht find them water kaill. How Prelats heichts thair teinds it is weill knawin, That husband-men may not weill hald thair awin. And now begins ane plague amang them new, That gentill men thair steadings taks in few. Thus man thay pay great ferme or lay thair steid, And sum ar plainlie harlit out be the heid, And ar distroyit without God on them rew. Paup. Sir be Gods breid that taill is verie trew. It is weill kend I had baith nolt and hors, Now all my geir ze se vpon my cors. Correction, Or I despairt I think to mak ane ordout Iohne. I pray zow sir begin first at bordour. For how can we send vs aganis Ingland Quhen we can nocht within our natiue Land, Destroy our awin Scots, common trator theifis, Quha to leill laborers daylie dois mischeifis. VVar I ane King my Lord be Gods wounds, Quha ever held c?mon theifis within thair bounds: Quhair throw that dayly leilmen micht be wrangit Without remeid thair chiftanis suld be hangit, Quhidder he war ane knicht, ane Lord or Laird The Devill draw me to hell and he war spaird. Tempora. Quhat vther enemies hes thou let vs ken? Iohne. Sir I compleine vpon the idill men: For quhy sir it is Gods awin bidding All Christian men to wirk for thair living. Sanct Paull that pillar of the Kirk, Sayis to the wretchis that will not wirk And bene to vertews laith Qui non laborat non manducet. This is in Inglische toung or leit: Duha labouris nocht he sall not eit, This bene against the strang beggers, Fidlers, pypers, and pardoners: Thir Iugglars, Iestars, and idill cuitchours, Thir carriers and thir quintacensours: Thir babil-beirers and thir bairds, Thir sweir swyngeours with Lords and Lairds: Ma then thair rents may susteine, Or to thair profeit neidfull bene, Quhilk bene ay blythest of discords, And deidly feid amang thar Lords. For then they sleutchers man be treatit, Or els thair querrels vndebaitit. This bene against thir great fat Freiris, Augustenes, Carmleits and Cordeleirs: And all vthers that in cowls bene cled, Quhilk labours nocht and bene weill fed. I mein nocht laborand Spirituallie, Nor for thair living corporallie: Lyand in dennis lyke idill doggis I them compair to weil fed hoggis. I think they do them selfis abuse, Seing that thay the warld refuse: Haising profest sic povertie, Syne fleis fast fra necessitie. Quhat gif thay povertie wald professe? And do as did Diogenes, That great famous Philosophour, Seing in earth bot vaine labour, Alutterlie the warld refusit, And in ane tun be him self inclusit, And leifit on herbs and water cauld, Of corporall fude na mair he wald. He trottit nocht from toun to toun, Beggand to feid his carioun. Fra tyme that lyfe he did profes, The wald of him was cummerles. Rycht sa of Marie Magdalene, And of Mary th'Egyptiane: And of auld Paull the first Hermeit, All thir had povertie compleit. Ane hundreth ma I micht declair, Bot to my purpois I will fair: Concluding sleuthfull idilnes, Against the Common-weill expresse. Correctioun. Quhom vpon ma will ze compleine? Iohne. Marie on ma and ma againe. For the pure peopill cryis with cairis, The infetching of Iustice airis: Exercit mair for couetice, Then for the punisching of vyce. Ane peggrell theif that steillis ane kow, Is hangit. bot he that steillis ane bow With als meikill geir as he may turs, That theif is hangit be the purs. Sic pykand peggrall theifis ar hangit, Bot he that all the warld hes wrangit, Ane cruell tyrane ane strang transgressour, Ane common publick plaine oppressour, By buds may he obteine fauours Of Tresurers and compositours. Thocht he serue greit punitioun, Gets easie compositioun: And throch laws consistoriall Prolixt, corrupt and perpetuall. The common peopill ar put sa vnder, Thocht thay be puir it is na wonder. Correction. Gude Iohne I grant all that is trew, Zour infortoun full sair I rew: Or I pairt aff this Natioun, I sall mak reformatioun. And als my Lord Temporalitie, I zow command in tyme that ze Expell oppressioun aff zour lands. And als I say to zow merchands, Gif ever I find be land or sie, Dissait be in zour cumpanie: Quhilk ar to Common-weill contrair, I vow to God I sall not spair To put my sword to executioun, And mak on zow extreme punitioun. Mairover my Lord Spiritualitie, In gudlie haist I will that ze Set into few zour temporall lands. To men that labours with thair hands. Bot nocht to ane gearking gentill man, That nether will he wirk, nor can: Quhair throch the policy may incresse. Temporalitie. I am content sir be the messe: Swa that the Spiritualitie, Sets thairs in few als weill as wee. Correctioun. My Spirituall Lords ar ze content? Spiritualitie. Na, na, wee man tak advysement In sic maters for to conclude, Ouir haistelie, wee think nocht gude. Cor. Conclude ze nocht with the Comon-weil Ze salbe punischit be Sanct Geill.

Wa than, ze think to stryue for stait. My Lords quhat say ze to this play? Temporalitie. My soverane Lords we will obay, And tak zour part with hart and hand, Quhat ever ze pleis vs to command. Heir sal the Temporal stait sit doun on thair knies, &amp; say. Bot wee beseik zow Soveraine, Of all our cryms that ar bygaine To gif vs ane remissioun, And heir wee mak to zow conditioun, The Common-weill for till defend From hence-forth till our liues end. Correctioun. On that conditioun I am content Till pardon zow sen ze repent, The Common-weill tak be the hand, And mak with him perpetuall band. Heir sall the temporal staits, to wit, the Lords and merchands imbreasse Iohne the Common-weill. Iohne haue ze ony ma debaits Against the Lords of Spirituall staits? Iohne. Na sir I dar nocht speik ane word. To plaint on Preistis it is na bourd: Correctioun. Flyt on thy fow fill I desyre the: Swa that thou sch?w bot the veritie. Iohne. Grandmerces then I sall nocht spair, First to compleine on the Vickair. The pure Cottar being lyke to die, Haifand zoung infants twa orthrie: And hes twaky but ony ma, The Vickar most haif ane of thay: VVith the gray frugge that covers the bed. Howbeit the wyfe be purelie cled, And gif the wyfe die on the morne, Thocht all the bairns sould be forlorne, The vther kow he cleiks away With the pure cot of raploch gray. Wald God this custome war put doun, Quhilk never was found it be ressoun. Temporal. Ar all thay tails trew that thou telles? Pauper. Trew sir, the Divill stick me elles. For be the halie Trinitie, That same was practeisit on me. For our Vickar God giue him pyne, Hes zit thrie tydie kye of myne. Ane for my father and for my wyfe ane vther, And the thrid cow he tuke for Mald my mother. Iohne. Our Persone heir he takis na vther pyne, Bot to ressaue his teinds and spend them syne. Howbeit he be obleist be gude resloun, To preich the Evangell to his parochoun. Howbeit thay suld want preiching sevintin zeir. Our Persoun will not want ane scheif of beir. Pau. Our bishops with thair lustie rokats quhyte, Thay flow in riches royallie and delyte: Lyke Paradice bene thair palices and places, And wants na pleasour of the fairest faces. Als thir Prelates hes great prerogatyues, For quhy thay may depairt ay with thair wyues: Without ony correctioun or damnage, Syne tak ane vther wantoner but mariage. But doubt I wald think it ane pleasant lyfe, Ay on ?uhen I list to part with my wyfe. Syne tak ane vther of far greiter bewtie, Bot ever alace my Lords that may not be, For I am bund alace in mariage, Bot thay lyke rams rudlie in thair rage. Vnpysalt rinnis amang the sillie zowis, Sa lang as kynde of nature in them growis. Person.

I mak an vow thay words thou sal repent. Counsall. I zow requyre my Lords be patient. Wee came nocht heir for disputatiouns, Wee came to make gude reformatiouns. Heirfoir of this zour propositioun, Conclude and put to executioun. Mer. My Lords conclud that al the t?poral lands Be set in few to laboreris with thair hands. With sic restrictiouns as sall be devysit, That thay may liue and nocht to be supprysit. With ane ressonabill augmentatioun, And quhen thay heir ane proclamatioun: That the Kings grace dois mak him for the weir, That thay be reddie with harneis, bow and speir. As for my self my Lord this I conclude. Coun. Sa say we all zour ressoun be sa gude. To mak ane Act on this we ar content: Iohne. On that sir Scribe I tak ane instrument. Quhat do ze of the corspresent and kow? Counsall. I wil conclude nathing of that as now Without my Lord of Spiritualitie, Thairto consent with all this haill cleargie. My Lord Bischop will ze thairto consent? Spri. Na, na, never till the day of Iudgement. Wee will want nathing that wee haue in vse, Kirtil nor kow, teind lambe, reind gryse nor guse. Tem. Forsuith my lord I think we suld conclude, Seing this kow ze haue in consuetude: Wee will decerne heir that the Kings grace, Sall wryte vnto the Paipis holines: With his consent be proclamatioun, Baith corspresent and cow wee sall cry doun. Spiri. To that my Lords wee plainlie disassent, Noter thairof I tak ane instrument. T?. My lord be him that al the warld hes wrocht, Wee set nocht by quhider ze consent or nocht: Ze ar bot ane estait and we ar twa, Et vbi maior par sibi tota. Ioh. My lords ze haif richt prudentlie concludit, Tak tent now how the land is clein denudit: Of gould and silver quhilk daylie gais to Rome, For buds, mair then the rest of Christindome. War I ane King sir be coks passioun, I sould gar mak ane proclamatioun. That never ane penny sould go to Rome at all, Na mair then did to Peter nor to Paull. Do ze nocht sa, heir for conclusioun I gifzow all my braid black malesoun. Merchant. It is of treuth sirs, be my christindome; That mekil of our money gais to Rome. For we merchants I wait within our bounds, Hes furneist Preists ten hundreth thowsand punds. For thair finnance, nane knawis sa weill as wee: Thairfoir my Lords devyse sum remedie. For throw thir playis and thir promotioun, Mair for denners nor for devotioun. Sir Symonie hes maid with them ane band, The gould of weicht thay leid out of the land. The Common-weil, thair throch bein sair opprest Thairfoir devyse remeid as ze think best. Counsell. It is schort tyme sen ony benefice, VVas sped in Rome except greit Bischopries. Bot now for ane vnworthie Vickarage, Ane Preist will rin to Rome in Pilgramage. Ane cavell quhilk was never at the scule, Will rin to Rome and keip ane Bischops mule: And syne cum hame with mony colorit crack, With ane buirdin of benefices on his back. Quhilk bene against the, law ane man alane, For till posses ma benefices nor ane. Thir greit commends I say withoutin faill, Sould nocht be giuen bot to the blude Royall: Sa I conclude my Lords and sayis for me, Ze sould annull all this pluralitie. Spritualitie. The Paip hes giuen vs dispensatiouns: Counsall. Zea that is be zour fals narratiouns. Thocht the Paip for zour pleasour will dispence, I trow that can nocht cleir zour conscience. Advyse my Lords quhat ze think to conclude, Temporalitie. Sir be my faith I think it verie gude, That fra hence furth na Preistis sall pas to Rome. Becaus our substance thay do still consume. For pleyis and for thair profeit singulair, Thay haif of money maid this realme bair. And a's I think it best be my advyse, That ilk Preist sall haif bot ane benefice. And gif thay keip nocht that fundatioun, It sall becaus of deprivatioun. Merchant. As ze haif said my Lord we wil consent, Scribe mak ane act on this incontinent. Couns. My Lords, thair is ane thing zit vnproponit How Prelats and Preistis aucht to be disponit: This be and done wee haue the les ado; Quhat say ze sirs? this is my counsall lo: That or wee end this present Parliament, Of this mater to tak rype advysement. Mark weill my Lords, thair is na benefice Giuen to ane man, bot for ane gude office. Quha taks office and syne thay can nocht vsit, Giuer and taker I say ar baith abusit. Ane Bischops office is for to be ane preichour, And of the law of God ane publick teachour. Rycht sa the Persone vnto his parochoun, Of the Evangell sould leir them ane lessoun. Thair sould na man desyre sic dignities, Without he be abill for that office. And for that caus, I say without leising, Thay haue thair teinds, and for na vther thing. Sp. Freind quhair find ze that we suld prechours be Coun. Luik quhat Sanct Paul wryts vnto Timothie Tak thair the Buik let se gif ze can spell. Spritual. I never red that, thairfoir reid it zour sel, Counsall sall read thir wordis on ane Buik. Fidelis sermo, siquis Episcopatum desiderat, bonum opus desiderat, oporteteum irreprehensibilem esse, vnius vxoris virum, sobrium, prudentem, ornatum, pudicum, hospitalem doctorem: non vinolentum, non percussorem: sed modestum. That is This is a true saying, If any man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a worthie worke: A Bishop therefore must be vnreproueable, the husband of one wife, &amp;c. Spiritualitie. Ze temporall men be him that heryit hell, Ze ar ovir peart with sik maters to mell. Temporalitie. Sit still my Lord, ze neid not for til braull, Thir ar the verie words of th'Apostill Paull. Spir. Sum sayis be him that woare the croun of thorne, It had bene gude that Paull had neir bene borne. Counsal. Bot ze may knaw my Lord Sanct Pauls intent, Schir red ze never the Newtestament? Spiritualitie. Na sir, be him that our Lord Iesus sauld, I red never the New testament nor auld. Nor ever thinks to do sir be the Rude, I heir freiris say that reiding dois na gude. Counsell. Till zow to reid them I think it is na lack, For anis I saw them baith bund on zour back: That samin day that ze was consecrat, Sir, quhat meinis that? Spiritualitie. The feind stick them that wat. Merchant. Then befoir God how can ze be excusit? To haif ane office and waits not how to vsit. Quhairfoir war gifin zow all the temporal lands? And all thir teinds ze haif amang zour hands. Thay war giuin zow for vther causses I weine, Nor mummil matins and hald zour clayis cleine. Ze say to the Appostils that ze succeid, Bot ze schaw nocht that into word nor deid. The law is plaine: our teinds suld furnisch teichours: Couns. Zea that it sould, or susteine prudent preichours. Pauper. Sir God nor I be stickit with ane knyfe, Gif ever our Persoun preichit in all his lyfe. Persone. Quhat devil raks the of our preiching vndocht? Pauper. Think ze that ze suld haue the teinds for nocht? Persone. Trowis thou to get remeid carle of that thing? Pauper. Zea be Gods breid richt sone war I ane King. Persone. Wald thou of Prelats mak deprivatioun? Pauper. Na I suld gar them keip thair fundatioun, Quhat devill is this, quhom of sould Kings stand aw? To do the thing that thay sould be the law. War I ane King be coks deir passioun, I sould richt sone mak reformatioun. Failzeand thair of zour grace sould richt sone finde, That Preists sall leid zow lyke ane bellie blinde. Iohne. Quhat gif King David war leiuand in thir dayis? The quhilk did found sa mony gay Abayis: Or out of heavin quhat gif he luikit doun? And saw the great abominatioun: Amang thir Abesses and thir Nunries, Thair publick huirdomes and thair harlotries, He wald repent he narrowit sa his bounds, Of zeir lie rent thriescoir of thowsand pounds. His successours maks litill ruisse I ges, Of his devotioun or of his holines. Abbasse. How dar thou carle presume for to declair, Or for to mell the with sa heich a mater? For in Scotland thair did zit it never ring, I let the wit ane mair excellent King. Of holines he was the verie plant, And now in heavin he is ane michtfull Sanct. Becaus that fyftein Abbasies he did found, Quhair throw great riches hes ay done abound Into our Kirk and daylie zit abunds, Bot kings now I trow few Abbasies founds. I dar weill say thou art condempnit in hel, That dois presume with sic maters to mell. Fals huirsun carle thou art ovir arrogant, To iudge the deids of sic ane halie Sanct. Iohne. King Iames the first Roy of this Regioun, Said that he was ane sair Sanct to the croun. I heir men say tha the was sumthing blind, That gaue away mair nor he left behind. His successours that halines did repent, Quhilk gart them do great inconvenient. Abbas. My Lord Bishop I mervel how that ze, Suffer this carle for to speik heresie? For be my faith my Lord will ze tak tent, He servis for to be brunt incontinent. Ze can nocht say bot it is heresie, To speik against our law and libertie. Spiritualitie. Sancte pater I mak zow supplicatioun, Exame zon carle, syne mak his dilatioun: I mak ane vow to God omnipotent, That bystour salbe brunt incontinent.

And than thay gart me cast out many plackis, And gart me pay for four and twentie actis. Bot or thay came half gait to concludendum, The feind ane plack was left for to defend him. Thus thay postponit me twa zeir with thair traine, Syne hodie ad octo bad me cum againe. And than thir ruiks thay roupit wonder fast, For sentence silver thay cryit at the last. Of pronunciandum thay maid me wonder faine, Bot I gat never my gude gray meir againe. Temp. My Lords we mon reforme thir consistory lawis, Quhais great defame aboue the heavins blawis.

The Bischop, Abbot, persone, and Priores depairts altogidder. Gude-counsall. Or ze depairt sir aff this Regioun, Gif Iohne the common-weill ane gay garmoun: Becaus the Common-weill hes bene overluikit, That is the caus that Common weill is cruikit. With singular profeit he hes bene sa supprysit, That he is baith cauld, naikit and disgysit. Correctioun. As ze haue said father I am content, Sergeants gif Iohne ane new abuilzement. Of Sating, Damais or of the Velvoit fyne, And gif him place in our Parliament syne. Heir sal thay cleith Iohne the common-well gorgeouslie and set him doun amang them in the Parliament. All verteous peopil now may be reioisit, Sen Common-weill hes gottin ane gay garmoun: And ignorants out of the Kirk deposit, Devoit Doctours and Clarks of renoun Now in the Kirk fall haue dominioun: And Gude-counsall with Ladie Veritie Ar profest with our kings Maiestie. Blist is that Realme that hes ane prudent King, Quhilk dois delyte to heir the veritie, Punisching thame that plainlie dois maling, Contrair the Common-weill and equitie. Thair may na peopill haue prosperitie, Quhair ignorance hes the dominioun, And c?mon-weil be tirants trampit doun. Pausa. Now maisters ze sall heir incontinent, At great leysour in zour presence proclamit The Nobill Acts of our Parliament, Of quhilks we neid nocht for to be aschamit. Cum heir trumpet &amp; sound zour warning tone That every man may knaw quhat he haue done. Heir sall Diligence with the Scribe and the trumpet pas to the pulpit and proclame the Actus. The first Act. It is devysit be thir prudent Kings, Correctioun and King Humanitie, That thair Leigis induring all thair Ringis, With the avyce of the estaits thrie Sall manfullie defend and fortifie The Kirk of Christ and his Religioun, Without dissimulance or hypocrisie: Vnder the paine of thair punitioun. 2. Als thay will that the Acts honorabill, Maid be our Prince in the last Parliament, Becaus thay ar baith gude and profitabill, Thay willl that everie man be diligent Them till observe with vnfeinze it intent. Quha disobeyis inobedientlie Be thair lawis but doubt thay sall repent, And painis conteinit thairin sall vnderly. 3. And als the Common-weil for til advance, It is statute that all the Temporall lands, Be set in few efter the forme of France Til verteous men that labours with thair hands: Resonabillie restrictit with sic bands, That thay do service nevertheles And to besubiect ay vnder the wands: That riches may with policie incres. 4. Item this prudent Parliament hes devysit, Gif Lords halds vnder thair dominioun Theifis, quhair throch puir peopil bein supprisit: For them thay sall make answeir to the croun, And to the pure mak restitutioun: Without thay put them in the iudges hands. For thair default to suffer punitioun, Sa that na theifis remaine within thair lands. 5. To that intent that Iustice sould incres It is concludit in this Parliament, That into Elgin or into Innernesse Sall be ane sute of Clarks sapient, Togidder with ane prudent Precident To do iustice in all the Norther Airtis, Sa equallie without impediment, That thay neid nocht seik iustice in thir pairts. 6. With licence of the Kirks halines, That iustice may be done continuallie, All the maters of Scotland mair and les, To thir twa famous saits perpetuallie Salbe directit, becaus men seis plainlie. Thir wantoun Nunnis ar na way necessair, Till Common-weill nor zit to the glorie Of Christs Kirk, thocht thay be fat and fair. And als that fragill ordour feminine, Will nocht be missit in Christs Religioun, Thair rents vsit till ane better fyne: For Common-weill of all this Regioun. Ilk Senature for that erectioun, For the vphalding of thair gravitie Sall haue fyue hundreth mark of pensioun. And also bot twa sall thair nummer be Into the North saxteine sall thair remaine, Saxtein rycht sa in our maist famous toun Of Edinburgh to serve our Soveraine: Chosen without partiall affectioun Of the maist cunning Clarks of this Regioun: Thair Chancellar chosen of ane famous Clark, Ane cunning man of great perfectioun, And for his pensioun haue ane thowsand mark. 7. It is devysit in this Parliament, From this day furth na mater Temporall Our new Prelats thairto hes done consent Cum befoir Iudges consistoriall, Quhilk hes bene sa prolixt and partiall: To the great hurt of the communitie: Let Temporall men seik Iudges Temporall. And Sprituall men to Spritualitie. 8. Na benefice beis giffin in tyme cumming, Bot to men of gude eruditioun: Except in the halie Scripture and cunning, And that thay be of gude conditioun: Of publick vices but suspitioun, And qualefiet richt prudentlie to preich, To thair awin folk baith into land and toun Or ellis in famous scullis for to teich: Als becaus of the great pluralitie Of ignorant Preists ma then ane Legioun. Quhair throch of Teicheouris the heich dignitie, Is vilipendit in ilk Regioun. Thairfoir our Court hes maid ane provisioun, That na Bshops mak teichours in tyme cumming: Except men of gude eruditioun, And for Preistheid qualefeit and cunning. Siclyke as ze se in the borrows toun Ane Tailzeour is nocht sufferit to remaine, Without he can mak doublet, coat and gown, He man gang till his prentischip againe: Bischops sould nocht ressaue me think certaine, Into the Kirk except ane cunning Clark: And ideot pretst Esay compaireth plaine, Till ane dum dogge that can nocht byte nor bark. 10. From this day furth se na Prelats pretend, Vnder the paine of inobedience At Prince or Paip to purchase ane command Againe the kow, becaus it dois offence: Till ony Preist we think sufficience And benefice for to serve God withall, Twa Prelats sall na man haue from thence, Without that he be of the blude Royall. 11. Item this prudent counsall hes concludit, Sa that our haly Vickars be nocht wraith From this day furth thay salbe cleane denudit Baith of corspresent cow and vmest claith. To pure commons becaus it hath done skaith And mairouer we think it lytill force, Howbeit the Barrouns thairto will be laith, From thine-furth thay sall want thair hyrald hors. 12. It is decreit that in this Parliament Ilk Bischop, Minister, Priour and Persoun, To the effect thay may tak better tent To saulis vnder thair dominioun, Efter the forme of thair fundatioun, Ilk Bischop in his Diosie sall remaine: And everilk Persone in his parachoun, Teiching thair folk from vices to refraine. 13. Becaus that clarks our substance dois c?sume For bils and proces of thair prelacies: Thairfoir thair sall na money ga to Rome From this day furth or any benefice: Bot gif it be for greit Archbischopries, As for the rest na money gais at all: For the incressing of thair dignities, Na mair nor did to Peter nor to Paull. 14. Considering yat our Preists for the maist part Thay want the gift of Chastitie wese: Cupido hes sa perst them throch the hart, We grant them licence and frie libertie, That thay may haue fair Virgins to thair wyfis: And sa keip matrimoniall Chastitie, And nocht in huirdome for to leid thair lyfis. 15. This Parliament richt sa hes done conclude From this day forth our Barrouns temporall, Sall na mair mix thair nobil ancient blude With bastard bairns of Stait Spirituall: Ilk stait amang thair awin selfis marie sall, Gif Nobils marie with the Spritualitie, From thyne subiect thay salbe, and all Salbe degraithit of thair Nobilitie. And from amang the Nobils cancellit: Vnto the tyme thay by thair libertie, Rehabilit be the ciuill magistrate And sa sall marie the Spiritualitie. Bichops with bischops affinitie, Abbots and Priors with the Priores: As Bischop Annas in Scripture we may se, Maryit his dochter on Bischop Caiphas. Now haue ze heard the Acts honorabill, Devysit in this present Parliament, To Common-weill we think agreabill: All faithfull folk sould heirof be content, Them till observe with hartlie trew intent, I wait nane will against our Acts rebell, Nor till our law be inobedient, Bot Plutois band the potent prince of hell. Heir sall Pauper cum befoir the King and say. Pauper. I gif zow my braid bennesoun, That hes givin Common-weill a goun: I wald nocht for ane pair of plackis, Ze had nocht maid this nobill Actis. I pray to God and sweit Sanct Geill, To gif zow grace to vse them weill: Wer thay weill keip it I vnderstand, It war great honour to Scotland. It had bene als gude ze had sleip it, As to mak acts and be nocht keip it: Bot I bezeik zow for Alhallows, To heid Dissait and hang his fellows.

I leirit zow merchants mony ane wyle, Vpalands wyfis for to begyle, Vpon ane markit day: And gar them trow zour stuffe was gude, Quhen it was rottin be the Rude, And sweir it was nocht sway. I was ay roundand in zour ear, And leirit zow for to ban and sweir, Quhat zour geir cost in France: Howbeit the Devill ane word was trew, Zour craft gif King Correctioun knew, Wald turne zow to mischance. I leirit zow wyllis many fauld, To nix the new wyne and the auld, That faschioun was na follie: To sell richt deir and by gud-echaip, And mix Ry-meill amang the saip, And Saiffrone with Oyl-dolie. Forzet nocht ocker I counsall zow, Mair then the vicker dois the kow, Or Lords thair doubill maill: Howbeit zour elwand be too skant, Or zour pound wecht thrie vnces want, Think that bot lytill faill. Adew the greit Clan Iamesone, The blude Royal of Clappertoun, I was ay to zow trew: Baith Andersone and Patersone, Above them all Thome Williamsone, My absence ze will rew.

Ze zoung merchants may cry allace, For wanting of zour wonted grace, Zon curst King ze may ban: Had I leifit bot halfe ane zeir I sould haue leirit zow crafts perqueir, To begyle wyfe and man. How may ze merchants mak debait? Fra tyme ze want zour man Dissait, For zow I mak great cair: Without I ryse fra deid to lyfe, I wait weill ze will neverthryfe, Farther nor the fourth air.

Cum heir gude Glaiks my dochter deir Thou salbe maryit within ane zeir, Vpon ane freir of Tillilum, Na thou art nather deaf nor dum: Cum hidder Stult my sone and air, My ioy thou art baith gude and fair: Now sall I fend zow as I may Thocht ze cry lyke ane Ke all day. Heir sal the bairns cry keck lyke ane Ke and he sal put meat in thair mouth. Diligence. Get vp Folie but tarying, And speid zow haistelie to the King: Get vp methink the carle is dum. Folie. Now bum baleriebum bum. Diligence. I trow the trucour lyis in ane trance Get vp man with ane mirrie mischance: Or be Sanct Dyonis of France, Ise gar the want thy wallet: Its schame to se man how thow lyis, Folie. Wa zit againe now this is thryis: The Devill wirrie me and I ryse, Bot I sall break thy pallet.

Diligence. Suyith harlot haist the to the King, And let allane thy tratrilling. Lo heir is Folie sir alreadie, Ane richt sweir swingeour be our Ladie. Folie. Thou art not half sa sweir thy sell, Quhat meins this pulpit, I pray the tell? Dili. Our new Bischops hes maid ane preiching, Bot thou heard never sic pleasant teiching: Zon Bischop wil preich throch the coast, Folie. Than stryk ane hag into the poast, For I hard never in all my lyfe, Ane Bischop cum to preich in Fyfe: Gif Bischops to be preichours leiris. Wallaway quhat sall word of freiris? Gif Prelats preich in brugh and land, The sillie freirs I vnderstand Thay will get na mair meall nor malt, Sa I dreid freirs sall die for falt. Sen sa is that zon nobill King, Will mak men Bischops for preiching: Quhat say ze sirs, hauld ze nocht best? That I gang preich amang the rest. Quhen I haue preichit on my best wayis, Then will I sell my merchandise, To my bretherin and tender maits, That dwels amang the thrie estaits. For I haue heir gude chaifery, Till any fuill that lists to by. Heir sall Foly hing vp his hattis on the pulpet and say. God sen I had ane Doctours hude. Rex. Quhy Folie wald thou mak ane preiching?

He war far meiter for the kitching, Amang the pottis sa Christ me saife. Fond Foly sall I be thy Clark, And answeir the ay with amen: Foly. Now at the beginning of my wark, The feind ressaue that graceles grim. Heir fal Folie begin hir sermon, as followis. Stultorum numerus infinitus. Salomon the maist sapient King In Israell quhan he did ring, Thir words in effect did write, The number of fuillis ar infinite. I think na schame sa Christ me saife, To be ane fuill amang the laise, Howbeit ane hundreth stands heir by, Perventure als great fuillis as I. Stultorum. I haue of my Genelogie, Dwelland in everie cuntrie, Earles, Duiks, Kings, and Empriours, With mony guckit Conquerours: Quhilk dois in Folie perseveir, And hes done sa this many zeir. Sum seiks to warldlie dignities, And sum to sensuall vanities Quhat vails all thir vaine honours, Nocht being sure to leife twa houris? Sum greidie fuill dois fill ane box, Ane vther fuill cummis and breaks the low: And spends that vther fuillis hes spaird, Quhilk never thocht on them to wairde. Sum dois as thay sould never die, Is nocht this folie, quhat say ze? Sapientia huius mundi stultitia est apud Deum. Becaus thair is sa many fuillis, Rydand on hors and sum on muillis: Heir I haue bocht gude chafery, Till ony fuill that lists to by. And speciallie for the thrie estaits, Quhair I haue mony tender maits: Quhilk causit them as ze may se, Gang backwart throw the haill cuntrie. Gif with my merchandise ze list to mell, Heir I haue Folie Hattis to sell. Quhairsoir is this Hat wald ze ken? Marie for insatiabill merchant men. Quhen God hes send them abundance Ar nocht content with sufficiance. Bot saillis into the stormy blastis, In Winter to get greater castis: In mony terribill great torment, Against the Acts of Parliament. Sum tynis thair geir, and sum ar drounde, With this sic merchants sould be crounde. Dili. Quhom to schaips thou to sell that hude? I trow to sum great man of gude. Folie. This hude to sell richt faine I wald, Till him that is baith auld &amp; cald: Reddie till pas to hell or heavin, And hes fair bairns sax or seavin: And is of age fourscoir of zeir, And taks ane lasse to be his peir: Quhilk is nocht fourteine zeir of age, And ioynis with hir in mariage: Geifand hir traist that scho nocht wald, Rycht haistelie mak him cuckald. Quha maryes beand sa neir thair dead, Set on this Hat vpon his head. Dili. Quhat Hude is that tell me I pray the? Folie. This is ane haly Hude I say the, This Hude is ordanit I the assure, For Sprituall fuillis that taks in cure, The saullis of great Diosies, And regiment of great Abesies, For gredines of warldlie pelfe, Than can nocht iustlie gyde them selfe. Vthers sauls to saife it settis them weill, Syne sell them awin saullis to the Deuil. Quha ever dois sa, this I conclude, Vpon his heid set on this Hude. Diligence. Foly is thair ony sic men Now in the Kirk that thou can ken? How sall I ken them?— Folie. Na keip that clois, Ex operibus eorum cognoscetiseos. And fuillis speik of the Prelacie, It will be hauldin for herisie. Rex. Speik on hardlie I gif the leife: Foly. Than my remissioun is in my sleife. Will ze leife me to speik of Kings? Rex. Zea hardlie speik of all kin things. Conforming to my first narratioun, Ze ar all fuillis be Coks passioun. Dili. Thou leis, I trow this fuill be mangit. Folie. Gif I lie God nor thou behangit. For I haue heir I to the tell Ane nobill cap imperiell, Quhilk is nocht ordanit bot for doings, Of Empreours, of Duiks and Kings. For princelie and imperiall fuillis, Thay sould haue luggis als lang as Muillis. The pryde of Princes withoutin faill, Gars all the warld rin top ovir taill. To win them warldlie gloir and gude, Thay cure nocht schedding of saikles blude. Quhat cummer haue ze had in Scotland, Be our auld enemies of Ingland? Had nocht bene the support of France, We had bene brocht to great mischance. Now I heir tell the Empreour, Schaippis for till be ane Conquerour. And is muifing his ordinance, Against the Nobill King of France. Bot I knaw nocht his iust querrell, That he hes for till mak battell. All the Princes of Almanie, Spain ze, Flanders and Italie. This present zeir ar in ane flocht: Sum sall thair wages find deir bocht. The Paip with bombard, speir and scheild, Hes send his armie to the feild. Sanct Peter, Sanct Paull nor Sanct Androw, Raisit never sic ane Oist I trow. Is this fraternall charitie, Or furious folie, quhat say ze? Thay leird nocht this at Christis Scuillis: Thairfoir I think them verie fuillis. I think it folie be Gods mother, Ilk Christian Prince to ding doun vther: Becaus that this hat sould belang them, Gang thou and part it evin amang them, The Prophesie withouttin weir, Of Merling beis compleit this zeir: For my gudame the Gyre Carling, Leirnde me the Prophesie of Marling: Quhairof I sall schaw the sentence, Gif ze will gif me audience. Flan Fran resurgent, simul Hispan viribus vrgent, Dane vastabunt, Vallones vallapar abunt. Sic sibi nomen in a mulier cacanst in olla: Hac epulum comedes— Diligence. Marie that is ane il fauorit dische. Folie. Sa be this Prophesie plainlie appeirs, That mortall weirs salbe amang freirs: Thay sall nocht knaw weill in thair closters. To quhom thay sall say thair Pater nosters. Wald thay fall to and fecht with speir and sheild The feind mak cuir quhilk of them win the feild. Now of my sermon haue I maid ane end, To Gilly-mouband I zow all commend. And I zow all beseik richt hartfullie: Pray for the saull of gude Cacaphatie: Quhilk laitlie drownit himself into Lochleavin, That his sweit saull may be aboue the heavin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diligen. Famous peopil hartlie I zow requyre, This lytill sport to tak in patience, We traist to God and we leif ane vther zeir, Quhair we haue failit we sall do diligence, With mair pleasure to mak zow recompence: Becaus we haue bene sum part tedious With mater rude, denude of eloquence, Likewyse perchance, to sum men odious. Now let ilk man his way avance, Let sum ga drink and sum ga dance: Menstrell, blaw vp ane brawll of France, Let se quha hobbils best: For I will rin incontinent, To the Tavern or ever I stent: And pray to God omnipotent, To send zow all gude rest. Rex sapiens æterne Deus genitorque benigne, Sit tibi perpetuo gloria, laus &amp; honor.</field>
