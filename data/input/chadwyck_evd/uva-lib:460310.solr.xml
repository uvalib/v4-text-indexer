      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter GRUMIO and TRANIO. GRUMIO. Come from your kitchen, will you? Out, you rogue, You who're so smart upon me 'midst your platters: Out of the house, thou ruin of thy masterâ By Pollux! let me catch thee in the country, And, as I live, I'll soundly be reveng'd.â Steam of the kitchen, why do'st hide thyself? Tra. You scoundrel, why this noise before the house! Think you, you're domineering in the country? Get from the houseâInto the countryâHence.â Go and be hang'dâGet farther from the doorâ What! was it this you wanted thenâ [striking him. Gru. Oh! Oh! What do'st thou strike me for? Tra. Because you wanted itâ Gru. Well, I must bear itâLet our old master but Return again; let him but safe arrive, Whom you are eating up while he's abroadâ Tra. You clown, you prate nor truth nor likelihood. How eat at home a man who is abroad? Gru. You! the mob-minion! the town-wit! You cast The country in my teeth! We soon shall have you Brought to the work-house there: by Hercules! You'll visit us in chains e'er long, and add One to the number of our iron raceâ Now, while 'tis in your power, use your time: Drink on, confound, corrupt your master's son. An excellent young man!âDays, nights together, Consume in riotâBe true Greeks; buy wenches, And set them free; feed parasites; and feast, Magnificently feast yourselvesâWere these Our master's orders when he went abroad? Thus shall he find things husbanded at home? This think'st thou a good servant's duty, this? To ruin both his son and his estate!â For, ruin'd I esteem him, who acts thusâ A youth, who us'd to bear the palm in Athens For temperance and frugality. But now Ranks foremost in the oppositeâEffects Of thy fine tutoring, thy virtuous care! Tra. You rascal, what have you to do with me, Or with my actions? Have you not your cattle To look to in the country? 'Tis my pleasure To drink, to love, to keep my girls. I do it At the hazard of my own back, not of yours. Gru. With what assurance does the fellow prate? Fie, fie upon it!â Tra. Now may Jupiter And all the Gods confound thee! How thou stink'st Of garlick! Filth by nature, rustick, goat, Foh! thou meer hog-styâDog and goat togetherâ Gru. What would'st thou have me do? We cannot all Stink as you do of foreign sweets; nor fill The upper place at table; nor all live On dainties like yourselfâWell, Sir! Enjoy Your turtle-doves, fish, wild fowl; and let me Do, tho' I stink, the duties of my station. Thy fortune's happy, miserable mineâ Both must be borneâWhy let them, so my good 'Bide but with me, as shall your ill with you. Tra. Grumio, you seem as if you envy'd me, Because 'tis well with me, and ill with you. Tho' 'tis but what is just: It fits my station, To keep my wenches; yours, to keep your cattle; Mine to live well, and yours to feed with hogs. Gru. Thou sieve of flesh! for such will be the end; So shall thy hide be finely pink'd, as through The streets thou bear'st thy gibbet, if our master But once returnâ Tra. How know'st thou, Grumio, But such may be thy fate sooner than mine? Gru. Because I've not deserv'd it as thou hast; And still deserv'stâ Tra. Shorten your tale, unless You wish t'enhance your punishmentâ Gru. Will you Let me have fodder then to feed my beasts? If you have none, why give me money for it; And, on then with your businessâOh! for me, As you've begun; drink, live like Greeks, eat, stuff, E'en till you burst; kill all your fatted daintiesâ Tra. Peace, get into the countryâNow will I Away to market, and buy fish for supper: I'll send you fodder for the farm to-morrow. What now? Why do you stare at me, you jail-birdâ Gru. That name will better suit you by-and-by: Yes, 'twill by Pollux!â Tra. Suit then what suit may: So I'm well now, I heed not by-and-by. Gru. Ay, that's your careâBut this one thing be sure ofâ Troubles come on us, swifter much than things We wishâ Tra. Yes, you're already come to trouble me. But hence!âTo th'countryâTake yourself away. 'Tis the last time, mark that, you e'er shall stay me. [Exit. Gru. [alone.] Is he quite gone? E'en so; nor cares a rush For ought I've saidâYour aid, immortal Gods! Send us, O send us back my good old master, These three years goneâGods! send him home again, E'er house and farm, and all is gone to wreck. If he return not in a few months more, No remnants will remainâI'll to the countryâ For see! my master's son is coming hither, Once a deserving youthânow, quite corruptedâ [Exit. SCENE II. Enter PHILOLACHES. Phi. I've long and often thought, and argued deep, And in my heart (if I have any heart) Have long debated and revolv'd, What's man Just born, to be compar'd to? and have now Found out his likeness. Man is a new houseâ I'll tell you how; and, tho' you think it not, I will convince you, what I say is true.â When you have heard, you'll think and say as I do. Lend me your ears, and you shall hear my arguments; For I'd have all as knowing as myselfâ As soon as e'er an edifice is plann'd, Built up in tast, and polish'd with exactness, The architect's commended: and his house By all approv'd; each takes it for a model, And spares no pains, no cost to have one like it. But when a tenant comes, unthrifty, mean, Neglectful, with a lazy family, The fault is strait upon the building laid; Good in itself, but kept in bad repair.â Then, as it often happens, comes a storm; Demolishes the tiling, spoils the gutters, And the too careless owner takes no heed The damage to repair. A shower of succeeds; Washes the walls, the roof admits the water, The weather rots the builder's edifice, The house grows worse by use: and in all this The architect is not at all to blameâ A great part of mankind affect delay; And, if it cost them money to repair it, Delay it still, till ev'ry wall falls in, And the whole's new again from the foundationâ Thus much for buildings.âNow, how men are like them. First thenâAll parents are their children's architects; They first lay the foundation, and then raise The superstructure of their educationâ They carefully add firmness; that they may Become good men; and be an ornament As well as use and safeguard to their countryâ And to such ends, they spare nor cost nor pains; Expence on this account, they count for nothing: Refine their manners, teach them letters, laws: And by their cost and care, endeavour still That other men should wish their children like themâ Then to the armyâThere their fathers place them Under protection of some great relation; And so they pass out of the builder's hands, 'Ere they have serv'd a yearâYou then may see A sample how the building may turn out. For I myself, as long as I was under The builder's hands, was sober all the time, And honestâBut as soon as e'er I follow'd My own inventions; I at once undid All that my architect had done before. Then enter'd idlenessâThat was the storm Brought on my hail and rain; quite overthrew My modesty, and each restraint of virtue, And utterly until'd meâHeedless I, Again to cover in my edifice; Love, like a torrent, rush'd into my heart, O'erflow'd my breast, and soak'd quite through my soul. And now, my fortune, credit, and fair fame, My virtue and my honour, all have left me. By negligence, I'm grown still worse and worse; These rafters are so ruinous, so foul, With rotting moisture, that, by Pollux' temple, I see no means remain to patch it up: The whole must fall, and its foundation fail, Without an hand to help me. My soul's vex'd, When I but think of what I once have been, And what I am. None of my age more active, Or at the discus, javelin, ball, at wrestling, In horsemanship, in racing, or in armsâ I then enjoy'd me, an example liv'd Of thrift and of hard living; an example The best have copied; but I now have found By following my inventions, after all, I am myself become as 'twere just nothing. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter PHILEMATIUM and SCAPHA. Philem. By Castor's temple! now I swear, my Scapha, I've not this long while bath'd with greater pleasure; Nor ris'n more pure from the cold wave, than now. Sca. Th'event of every thing with you succeeds, Like the rich harvest to the yearâ Philem. What's harvest To my cold bath?â Sca. Just what your bath's to harvest. Re-enter PHILOLACHES. Philol. [apart.] Love's lovely Goddess! This, this is my storm That strip'd the modesty once cover'd me. Cupid and love have rain'd into my breast, Nor can I roof it in. My heart's strong walls Soak'd thro', my fabrick failsâ Philem. I prithee, Scapha, Look if this dress becomes me; for I'd fain Please my Philolaches, my lov'd protectorâ Sca. That pretty person, is it not adorn'd Enough with pretty manners? No: our garments The men admire not, but what stuffs them out. Philol. [apart.] Now as the Gods shall love me, Scapha's waggish. How knowing the jade is! and how prettily She has learn'd the art of love, and lover's maxims! Philem. What say you now? Sca. What should I say? Philem. Look at me; And see if this becomes me?â Sca. In yourself You are so handsome, every thing becomes you. Philol. [apart.] This day, my Scapha, shalt thou find me grateful; Nor ever shall thy praise of her I love Pass unrewardedâ Philem. I'd not have you flatter me. Sca. A simple woman! Had you rather then Be discommended, when there is no room for't, Than prais'd with truth? By Pollux! I'd much rather Be spoken well of, tho' there were no truth in't, Than be found fault with; and to have my beauty A laughing-stock for othersâ Philem. I love truth: And wish to have it always spoken to me, I hate a liar.â Sca. May you so love me, So may your own Philolaches love you As you are truly charming!â Philol. [apart.] Ah! the jade? What adjuration!âBy my love to her! Why was not added, by her love to me! You've lost again your promis'd recompence. Then I revoke my gifts; 'tis over with you. Sca. By Pollux! 'tis amazing! you that are So clever, so accomplish'd, so brought up, And not a fool, should act so foolishlyâ Philem. Tell me, if I'm in faultâ Sca. By Castor! yes. It is a fault, when your whole wish is center'd In him alone, and still to humour him Your chief regard; all other men despis'd. 'Tis a wife's duty, not a courtezan's, To be devoted to a single lover. Philol. [apart.] Jove! what a plague is this come to my house? May all the Gods in the worst way confound me, If I be not the death of that old jade, By hunger, thirst and coldâ Philem. I would not Scapha Should counsel me bad measuresâ Sca. Fool indeed! If you can think to keep this man for ever Your friend and benefactor. Take my warning, When age and when satiety come on, He will desert youâ Philem. Nay, I hope not so. Sca. Things we not hope for, oftner come to pass, Than things we wishâIf you'll not take my word, Let fact convince you. See an instance here, In what I now am, and in what I have been. I once had my admirers, as you now; And was to one devotedâAnd that one Left me, as soon as age began to change The colour of my hairâDeserted meâ And this will be your caseâ Philol. [apart.] I scarce refrain From plucking out the eyes of this incendiary. Philem. 'Tis right I keep myself alone for him, Who of himself alone, with his own money Gave me my freedom. Philol. [apart.] By the immortal Gods! She's a sweet girlâand of chast disposition! By Hercules! I've done well; and I rejoice, That I'm not worth a drachma for her sake. Sca. Silly indeed!â Philem. Why so?â Scap. To be uneasy, Whether or no he loves you.â Philem. And why, prithee! Should I not be uneasy? Sca. You're now free: You have what you desireâOf his free choice If now he did not love you, he'd have lost The money which he gave to buy your freedom. Philol. [apart.] I'll die myself, by Hercules! but I'll put That jade to a most cruel death! This bawd, This ill-persuading bawd is absolutely Corrupting of the girlâ Philem. No, never can I Repay, as he deserves, my obligations. Scapha, persuade me not to love him less. Sca. Expect then, if you will devote your prime To him alone, to sigh in vain when oldâ Philol. [apart.] O that I now were chang'd into a quinsey, To seize her throat, and strangle the vile jade. Philem. 'Tis fit that I preserve the same mind now That my desires obtain'd; to compass which, I sooth'd him with caressesâ Philol. [apart.] May the Gods Act all their pleasure on me, for that speech, If I'd not free thee once again! and be The death of Scapha!â Sca. If you're well assur'd Your lover still will to your yoke submit, And be your own for life, e'en humour him, And him alone.âBe to him like a wife. Philem. People thrive well but as their names are fair. Let me but keep my fame and character, I shall be rich enoughâ Philol. [apart.] By Hercules! If it must come to selling, I'll e'en sell My father, rather than I'll suffer thee To want, or be a beggar while I liveâ Sca. What's to become then of your other lovers? Philem. They'll love me better, when they see me grateful. Philol. [apart. O that I now could hear my father's dead, That I at once myself might disinherit, And make this girl my heir!â Sca. He can't hold long. Whole days and nights consum'd in eating, drinking, No thought of thriftâthe fellow's a meer styâ Philol. [apart.] By Hercules! you first shall feel my thrift, For you no more shall eat and drink with me. Philem. Speak well of him; talk on: but if you abuse him, By Castor's temple! you shall suffer for it. Philol. [apart.] By Pollux' temple! had I sacrific'd To mighty Jove what I disburs'd for her, I'd not so well bestow'd itâMark how well, How heartily she loves meâWisely done, To plead my cause, I've freed an advocate. Sca. Philolaches, I see, outweighs mankind In your esteemâI'd better join with you, Than smart for him, since you're so well assur'd He'll be your friend for everâ Philem. Reach the mirror; The casket too, where all my trinkets are: Quick! that I may be dress'd, when my delight, My dear Philolaches shall hither come. Sca. The woman that neglects herself, her youth, Had need a mirror use: but why should you, Who are yourself a mirror to the mirror? Philol. [apart.] Scapha, that pretty turn, shall something add To your own stock. Sweet Philematium! Philem. See if each hair be nice, and in its place. Sca. So nice yourself, doubt not your hair's so too. Philol. [apart.] What character can e'er be given worse Than is that jade's? All flattery now; before, All oppositionâ Philem. Quick! give me the white. Sca. What need have you of white?â Philem. To paint my cheeks. Sca. Oh! that's like making ivory white with ink. Philol. [apart.] Wittily said that of the ink and ivory! 'Tis well said, Scapha; I applaud you for it. Philem. Give me the red then!â Sca. NoâYou're merry sure! What! spoil a finish'd piece with a new daubing? Such bloom as thine, no paint should ever touch, No wash come near, ceruse, nor white of Meloâ Philem. Take then the mirrorâ Philol. [apart.] What a jade! she has kiss'd it. O for a stone to break it all to shatters! Sca. Here, take the towelâWipe your handsâ Philem. Why so? Sca. Lest having touch'd the mirror, they smell silvery;â And never must Philolaches suspect You have been touching silverâ Philol. [apart.] I scarce know I ever met with a more cunning bawdâ Why, what a witty thought; a subtle one The jade had 'bout the mirror!â Philem. What do'st think? Should I perfume me?â Sca. By no means. Philol. And why? Sca. A woman's best smell is to smell of nothing: I swear 'tis trueâYour 'nointed hags, who still New vamp themselves, and hide with paint their wrinkles, When once the sweat and perfumes mix, will stink Worse than the greasy compound, when a cook Pours all his broths together. None can say Of what they smell; but only they smell ill. Philol. How learnedly the jade treats every thing! The knowing ones less knowing than herself! [to the spectators. You know this true, who have old wives at home, That bought you with their portionsâ Philem. This gold robe! See, does't become me well enough, my Scapha?â Sca. That is not my concernâ Philem. Then, prithee, whose? Sca. I'll tell youâ'Tis Philolaches'sâHis; That he may never buy you what you like not: For 'tis with gold and purple lovers buy Their mistress' favours; and what need have you To make a shew of what he does not want. Hide age in purpleâGold becomes not youth, A naked beauty is more charming, than From head to foot in purple. 'Tis in vain A woman is well dress'd, if ill behav'd. Ill conduct soils the finest ornaments, As bad as dirt: for if a woman's handsome, She's dress'd enoughâ Philol. [apart.] Too long I've held me from her. What are you two about?â [shewing himself. Philem. I'm decking out Myself to please your eyeâ Philol. You're dress'd enough. Do you go in [to Scapha] and take this finery. But you, my Philematium, my delight, I would regale with youâ Philem. And I am for you, My love, my only joy, your pleasure's mine. Philol. That word, my love, is cheap at twenty minÃ¦. Philem. Then give me ten, my dearâI'll sell a bargain. Philol. You have got ten alreadyâCast the account. I gave just thirty minÃ¦ for your freedom Philem. And why reproach me?â Philol. Can I then reproach thee? With what I wish to be reproach'd myself? I have not laid out money, many a day More to my satisfactionâ Philem. And I'm sure, I never better can employ my pains, Than in the love I bear youâ Philol. We're agreedâ Debtor and creditorâWe love each other, And both, we think deservedlyâMay all Who joy in ours, joy in their own good fortune, Who envy us, ne'er envy'd be themselvesâ Philem. Then take your placeâSome water for our handsâ Boy, set the little table hereâThe diceâ Would you have perfumes?â Philol. Ah! what need of perfumes? When happy, I recline myself near you. But is not that my friend, who's coming hither, And with his mistress too?âSee Callidamates Approaches with his mistressâCome on, loveâ Our comrades! See, they expect to share our plunderâ SCENE IV. Enter CALLIDAMATES [drunk] and DELPHIUM. Cal. Come in good time, and fetch me from Philolaches. [to a servant. Hearâthat's my orderâFor from where I've been, I e'en took to my heels, so tir'd I was With both their entertainment and discourse.

Fall then, and take the consequence. I'm on the totterâFall you, I fall with youâ Then both being down, some one shall help up both of usâ He's sadly drunkâ Cal. Does mam-my say, I'm drunk? Del. Give me your handâI would not have thee hurt. Cal. Here, take itâStayâkeep along with me, tho'â Where am I goâingâgoâing?âCan you tell? Del. Yes, sureâ Cal. Oh! now it comes into my headâ I'm goâing homeâto spend the eveningâ Del. Certainlyâ Cal. Yesâto be sureâI well remember thatâ Philol. [to Philem.] Will you not give me leave, my soul, to meet 'em? He's one of all my friends I've most regard for. I will return e'en nowâ Philem. Ah! that e'en now To me's an ageâ Cal. Is any body there? Del. There isâ Cal. That's well. Philolaches, good dayâ My best of friendsâ Philol. God save you, Callidamates! Here, take your placeâWhence is it you come now? Cal. Whence should a man that's drunk?â Philol. Why, well said, boy. Come, if you love me, Delphium, take your place. Cal. Give her some wineâI'll go to sleep directlyâ Philol. His constant tradeâNought strange or wonderful. What, my dear Delphium, shall I do with him? Del. E'en leave him as he isâ Phil. Come on thenâBoy, A cup of wine round, and begin with Delphium. SCENE V. Enter TRANIO. Tra. [apart.] Great Jove with all his might, and all his power, Is seeking mine, and my young master's ruin.â All hope is goneâNo ground remains for courage, Nor could salvation's self, had she a mind, Now save us. What a mountain of distress Have I just seen at port! My master's landed, And Tranio ruin'dâIs there any here [to the spectators. Would earn a little gain, and take my place At the whipping-post?âWhere are your hardned rogues Will bear a flogging?âOr, for a trifling sum, Would with their lances, dare attack a towerâ Where you may have five hundred spears at once Fix'd in your bodyâI will give a talent To the first man shall run and seize my gibbet. But 'tis on this condition, that his legs And arms be doubly bound; and when that's done, Let him demand his money: he shall have it. But what a dog am I not to scour homeâ? Philol. Our supper's comeâSee, Tranio, from the port. Tra. Philolachesâ Philol. The matter?â Tra. I and youâ Philol. What do you mean by I and you?â Tra. Are ruin'd. Philol. How so?â Tra. Your father's here.â Philol. What's that you tell me? Tra. Undone! undone!âI say, your father's comingâ Philol. Where is he, prithee!â Tra. Just upon my heelsâ Philol. Who says so? Who has seen him?â Tra. That have I. I say, I saw himâ Philol. What am I about? Tra. A mischief on you! ask what you're about? About your supperâ Philol. You yourself have seen him! Tra. I have, I sayâ Philol. Indeed!â Tra. I say, indeedâ Philol. Undone indeed, if what you say is true. Tra. What shall I get by telling you a lie? Philol. What's to be done?â Tra. Order these things awayâ Who's that asleep?â Philol. Why, Callidamatesâ Tra. Awake him, Delphiumâ Del. Callidamates! Why, Callidamates! awakeâ Cal. Wellâwell, [drunk] I wakeâGive me a cup of wine.â Del. Wake, wakeâ Philolaches's father's just arriv'dâ Cal. I hopeâhis father's wellâ Philol. He's wellâand I Undoneâ Cal. Undone! How can that be?âUndone! Philol. UpâHere's my father comingâ Cal. Father comingâ Bid himâbegone againâWhat comes he here for? Philol. What shall I do? Wretch! Shall my father find me Immers'd in riot; his house full of guests, And wenches?âA sad job, to dig a well, When your throat's parch'd with thirstâAnd that's my case; Who, now my father's come, am quite bewildered.

Are we to move? Tra. No farther off than this; [pointing with his finger.] nor need you drink One cup the less on that account.â Philol. Fine words! But where they'll endâI'm in a sweat for fear. Tra. Can you be quiet, and obey command? Del. Yes, yes, I canâ Tra. First, Philematium then Walk in; and Delphium, youâ Del. We're all obedience. [Exeunt Phil. and Delph. Tra. Jove grant you may!

Wellâ Tra. And be sure let no man answer, when The old man knocksâ Philol. Any thing farther?â Tra. Bid them Bring out to me the master key of the house, That I may lock the door on the outside. Philol. To thy protection, Tranio, I commend Myself and all my hopesâ [they go in. Tra. It matters not A feather, be a man supported, or By patron, or by client, if himself Wants steadiness and courage. Every one Or best or worst, can act with craft enough, Tho' ne'er so suddenlyâGive me the key, Go in and shut the doorâ[to the Boy, who goes in.] but the great care And mastery of the art, is, where the roguery Is plann'd and executed, so to manage That nothing rise to shame the great projector: That all run smooth, and happy be the issue: As you shall see me do, and all this bustle Glide glibly on, without a check to hurt usâ Re-enter BOY. But what d'you mean by coming out? Undone! How well my orders are obey'd!â Boy. My master Has order'd me most earnestly to beg you Some how to scare his father from the door.

Go back, and tell him this; That I shall take such measures, he shan't dare To look upon the house; but veil his head, And run away for fearâGive me the keyâ InâShut the doorâI'll lock it without side. [Exit Boy. Now let him comeâAnd he shall see alive Such games perform'd to his honour, as I trust, Will ne'er be paid him deadâBut I'll retire, And reconnoitre, where I best may load His shoulders with this burthen, when he entersâ [Exit.

Tell him, you'll pay it him, and send him packingâ Theu. I tell him that I'll pay it!â Tra. Tell himâ Theu. I? Tra. Yes, you yourselfâBut tell himâPromise himâ Tell him, I sayâI bid you do itâ Theu. Answer me. What was this money for?â Tra. 'Tis safeâ Theu. If so, Pay it yourselvesâ Tra. Your son has bought a house. Theu. A house? Tra. A house.â Theu. Well doneâFather's own son. Philolaches now turns himself to merchandizeâ Say you, a house?â Tra. A house, I sayâBut know you What sort of house?â Theu. How should I?â Tra. Fine!â Theu. What's that? Tra. Ask me not.â Theu. Why? Tra. Bright as a looking-glassâ Brightness itselfâ Theu. Well done! And whatâwhat cost it? Tra. Great talents, just as many, Sir, as you And I make, put togetherâThese he gave, These minÃ¦, Sir, as earnest, which he borrow'd Of this same person. [pointing to the banker.] You conceive me now? For once inform'd, your house was in the state I told you, instantly he bought another. Theu. Well done, by Hercules! Ban. 'Tis near noonâD'ye hear? Tra. Dismiss this filthy fellow, Sir, I beg you, That he no more keep plaguing of us here. His debt is only four-and-forty minÃ¦, Both principal and interestâ Ban. Just that sum. I ask no more.â Tra. I wish thou would'st, by Hercules! Ask but a single sesterce moreâ Theu. Young man, Transact the affair with meâ Ban. Content.âYou then My debtor areâ Theu. To-morrow, come, and ask itâ Ban. I'm goneâI'm easy, so I'm paid to-morrow. [Exit Banker. Tra. May all the Gods and Goddesses confound The dog, for breaking all my measures thus! I swear, there's no worse race of men this day, Nor greater rascals, than your bankers are. Theu. Say, in what quarter of the town's this house My son has bought?â Tra. Look there again! Undone! [apart. Theu. Answer you not my question?â Tra. YesâBut now, I'm thinking what should be the owner's name. Theu. Wellârecollect thenâ Tra. What is now to do? [apart. Suppose I throw the lie on our next neighbour; And say, 'tis his house that his son has bought.â By Hercules! I've often heard it said, Your piping-hot lie, is the best of lies. What the Gods dictate, out with itâ'tis right. Theu. Well, have you recollected?â Tra. May the Gods Confound this scoundrel! [meaning the Banker.] He has put the name Out of my headâor rather, [apart, meaning Theu.] thisâThe house Your son has bought, is that of your next neighbour.â Theu. Reallyâ Tra. Yes, really, if you'll pay the money: If not, not reallyâ Theu. The house he has bought Is not well situatedâ Tra. Sure, very wellâ Theu. Now, by my troth, I wish to see this house. Knock at the doorâCall some one out to youâ Tra. [apart.] Why now, I'm struck all on a heap again. The waves still drive me on the self-same rock. What's to be done? By Hercules! no fetch!â I'm caught that's plainâ Theu. Call some one from within To shew us round the houseâ Tra. Hola, there! Ho! [calling aloud.] But there are womenâBest it were to know If they will let us see the house or not. Theu. You say but what is rightâEnquire and ask, And I'll wait here without till your return. [retires. Tra. [apart.] May all the Gods and Goddesses confound you For thus opposing of my schemes, old gentleman! See, in good time, the master of the house, Simo, is coming outâI'll here retire, While I convene the senate of my mind. When a decree is pass'd, how to proceed, I'll join him.â [retires. SCENE II. Enter SIMO, from the house. THEUROPIDES and TRANIO. [apart.] Simo. Better I've not far'd this yearâ Nor better relish'd a tid-bit at homeâ My dame had cater'd well this dinner for me; And now she bids me take a napâNot I.â At first I never dream'd, why she provided Better than usualâThe old soul, it seems Wanted to draw me to the bed-chamber. NoâSleep is never good just after dinnerâ Fie on it, noâI've stol'n me out of doors. I know my wife's ready to burst within.â Tra. [apart.] The man will find worse catering at night, Where he must bed and board, howe'er provided.â Simo. The more I turn it in my thoughts, I find, The man who marries a well-portion'd dame, Sleep ne'er solicitsâHe abhors such napping. This I determineâI had better go Hence to the Forum, than to nap within. I know not, Sirs, how 'tis with you at home, [to the spectators. But this I know, I've plague enough with mine: And now, she's like to mend from bad to worse. Tra. [apart.] If your elopement turn out ill, old gentleman, The Gods are not to blame, the fault's your ownâ But 'tis high time I speak to himâYes, he has itâ He's fairly caughtâI've hit upon a trick To lead him by the nose, and ease myself Of this diseaseâBut I must to himâSimo, The favour of the Gods attend you!â Simo. Save you! Tra. How fare you?â Simo. Pretty wellâWhat art about? Tra. Why, shaking hands here with the best of men. Simo. 'Tis kindly done, when you speak well of me. Tra. No more than you deserveâ Simo. That's trueâand yet, When I shake hands with you, by Hercules! I swear, it is not with an honest servantâ Tra. Simo, how so?â Simo. Why, what art doing now? What girl was that you latelyâ Tra. What's all this? Simo. Nothing uncommonâ Tra. Not uncommon?âSpeakâ Simo. What you're about, is no uncommon thing. And, to say truth, it is but fitting, Tranio, E'en as men are, so should you humour themâ And then, thinkâlife is shortâ Tra. What!âOh! at last I've found you outâYou are talking of our matters? Simo. Yes, 'tis but fitâNeat wines, good cheer, choice fishâ You enjoy lifeâ Tra. Time wasâbut now Things are fall'n offâ Simo. How so?â Tra. We're all undone!â Simo. Why do you keep on this talking? Hitherto All has gone wellâ Tra. It has been as you say, I not denyâWe've liv'd e'en as we wish'dâ But now, the gale has slackened on a sudden. Simo. How so? How could it happen so untowardly? Has not your vessel long been safe in port? Tra. Ah me!â Simo. The matter?â Tra. Wretch! I am undone! Simo. How?â Tra. A huge ship has fallen foul upon us, And broke our little frigate all to piecesâ Simo. I had been glad, had matters gone on smoothlyâ But say, the businessâ Tra. My old master's landedâ Simo. A string stretch'd out for you! To prison first, And thenâthe gallowsâ Tra. By these knees, I beg you Not to betray us to my masterâ Simo. Fear notâ Tra. My patron, thanksâ Simo. I care not for such clients. Tra. Now to the business of my embassyâ Simo. First answer me this questionâYour old master, Has he discover'd any thing? Tra. He?ânothingâ Simo. Not chide his son?â Tra. Calm as fair weather, he Has order'd me to beg it as a favour You'd let him see your houseâ Simo. 'Tis not on sale. Tra. I know itâBut he's going to erect A new apartment for the women here, At his own house, bath, gallery and portico.â Simo. What! does he dream? Tra. I'll tell you then the matter. He wants his son to marry soon; and so To forward it, he builds this new apartmentâ Some one has recommended yours, he says, For architecture, and for workmanship; And, if you've no objection, he would build Upon your planâ Simo. A scurvy piece of work To take a plan from! Tra. For he understands 'Tis a good summer situation, where You th'whole day may pass i'th'open air, And never see the sunâ Simo. True, when 'tis cloudyâ But here, from morn to night, like any dun, Close at my door he standsâShade I have none, But at the bottom of my well. Tra. What then? From Sarsina! and yet not ought of Umbria? Simo. Don't be impertinentâ'Tis as I say. Tra. Yet he'd fain see itâ Simo. Let him, if he will. And, if he likes, he's welcome to the plan. Tra. Shall I go call him hither?â Simo. Ayâgo, call him. Tra. [apart.] 'Tis said that Alexander, and Agathocles, Are two the greatest heroesâWhat reward Shall the third have? I, Tranio, who alone. Immortal deeds atchieveâBoth these old fellows Carry the pack-saddleâI have hit upon This new device, that promises not ill. Your muleteers keep mules to carry saddles; Now I make use of men, and men of burthen; All you lay on, they carryâShall I then Accost him?âYesâI willâHola! Theuropides! Theu. Who calls?â Tra. A servant, faithful to his master. I've done the business, Sir, you sent me on. Theu. But why so long about it?â Tra. The old gentleman Was not at leisureâsoâI waited for him. Theu. You keep your old way, to be tardy ever. Tra. Think on the saying, master: 'tis not easy To blow and swallow at the self-same time. I can't be here and there at once.â Theu. What now? Tra. Why, come and see the houseâLook over it At pleasure, Sirâ Theu. Come on then, shew the way. Tra. Do I delay?â Theu. I follow youâ Tra. See, Sir, Th'old gentleman waits for you at his doorâ He's so concern'd that he has sold his houseâ Theu. Why so?â Tra. He begs me to persuade Philolaches To let him offâ Theu. I think of no such thing. Each for himself.âIf we had bought it dear, We could not have return'd it on his hands. The bargain good, why, quick, convey it home.â This is no case of charityâ Tra. By Hercules! You lose your time in talkingâFollow meâ Theu. I'm rul'd by youâ Tra. He's here. [to Simo.] I've brought my master. Simo. I'm glad to see you safe return'd, Theuropides. Theu. Save you!â Simo. Your servant has been telling me You wish'd to see my houseâ Theu. If 'tis convenientâ Simo. Quite soâWalk in, and see itâ Tra. But the womenâ Simo. [sneering.] Ay, pray take heedânor disoblige a woman. Walk o'er the house, as if it was your own. Theu. As ifâ Tra. Take heed, nor twit him with the sale of it. Now he's in such concernâDo you not see How sad he looks?â Theu. I see itâ Tra. Then take heed, He thinks you too well pleas'd with your great bargain; And o'er the loss with mockery to triumphâ No mention of the purchaseâ Theu. I conceive you, You caution wellâI find you are good-natur'dâ What now is to be done? Simo. What! but go in; And see the house at leisure as you likeâ Theu. Kindly done of youâ Simo. Troth, I mean it so. Tra. D'you see the vestibule before the house?â The gallery tooâof what a compass 'tis. Theu. Troth, and by Pollux' temple! truly handsome. Tra. The pillars, see how strong and large they're made, With what a substanceâ Theu. I don't recollect To have seen handsomerâ Simo. They should be so, For sure, I bought them dear, a long while since. Tra. He bought them dear! D'ye mind! You see, he scarce Refrains from tearsâ[to Theuropides.] Theu. And bought them, at what price? Simo. Three minÃ¦ for the two, besides the carriage. Theu. I think worse of them than I did at first. Tra. Why so?â Theu. Because the worms, by Pollux' temple! Have been at both their bottomsâ Tra. I should think The timber fell'd at an improper season, And thence the damageâThey'll do well enough If painted: yet 'twas no barbarian artist That did this work! See how the doors are jointed! Theu. I seeâ Tra. Observe how sound they sleep.â Theu. How! sleep! Tra. They wink, I meanâWell, are you satisfied? Theu. The more I look, the more I likeâ Tra. You see Yon raven painted, baffling of two vulturs?â There stands the raven pecking at them bothâ First one, then t'otherâThis way look, towards me, That you may see the ravenâDon't you see him? Theu. I see no raven, Iâ Tra. Look towards yourselves: Altho' you see no raven, you may chance To spy the vultursâ Theu. To cut short the matter, I see no painted bird at allâ Tra. I drop it then. Every old man has not his eye-sight clear. Theu. What I do see, pleases me much indeed. Tra. Best then go farther inâ Theu. Troth! well advis'd. Simo. Here, boyâGo shew this gentleman the house, And the apartmentsâI would do it myself, But that I've business waits me at the Forum. Boy. Shall I conduct you, Sir?â Theu. Noâno conductor. I'd rather uninstructed lose my way, Than bear a guideâ Boy. Into the house, I mean. Theu. I can go there without a guideâ Boy. Go then Where'er you pleaseâ Theu. I goâ Tra. Stay, first let's see If there is not a dogâ Theu. Ay, lookâ Tra. There is, Theu. Where is the dog?â Tra. Be goneâa mischief to you! Go and be hang'd, you curâWhat! not be gone? 'S't! get awayâ Simo. Come onâThere is no danger. He is as gentle as a drop of waterâ You may come boldly onâI'll to the Forum. Theu. You have behav'd most kindlyâA good voyageâ [Exit Simo. Ho! Tranio, drive this dog here from the door, [Exit Simo. Tho' we've no need to fearâ Tra. Look at himâSee, How quietly he liesâbut don't pretend To make a bustle, and seem cowardlyâ Theu. Well, as you will: but followâ Tra. Never fear. Depend upon't, I shall not be far offâ [they enter the house. SCENE III. TRANIO, THEUROPIDES, [in the inside of the house.] Tra. What think you of the bargain now?â Theu. Quite pleas'dâ Tra. Do you think it dear?â Theu. I think, I never saw A house so thrown awayâ Tra. You're pleas'd with it? Theu. Pleas'd, say you? Ay, by Hercules! much pleas'dâ Tra. What women's rooms are here! and what a portico! Theu. Exceeding goodâI do not think there's larger Among the publick buildingsâ Tra. I, and Philolaches Overlook'd all the portico's. Theu. And, well!â Tra. This is the largest. Theu. Gods! a pretty bargain! If any one would offer six great talents, And ready money too, I would not take them. Tra. And if you would, I would not give you leave. Theu. 'Tis money well laid out on this same purchase. Tra. Then boldly say, that I was the adviser: Say, Tranio press'd itâSay, he urg'd it on, To take up money of the banker; and To advance this earnestâ Theu. You have sav'd the ship. The debt, you say, is eighty minÃ¦â Tra. Just. Theu. Then let him have't to-dayâ Tra. That's rightâfor then There can be no disputeâGive me the money, And I will give it himâ Theu. But if I trust You with it, take good heedâNo quirk, no cavilâ Tra. And do you think, I'd dare to play on you By word or deed?â Theu. And do you think I dare Be off my guard, if I should trust you thus? Tra. Me, that has ne'er deceiv'd you, since you had me! Theu. Thanks to my caution tho'âSo much I owe To my own judgementâIf I can but now Look after you, I shall be wise enoughâ Tra. I am of your opinion thereâ [apart. Theu. Away. Go now into the countryâTell my son, That I'm come homeâ Tra. I'll do as you would have me. Theu. Hast then, and bring him up to town with you. Tra. It shall be doneâ[Exit Theu.] Now, to my merry lads By this back-door, with my good news; that all Is snug; and our old gentleman gone off.â End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter PHANISCUS. Slaves, who tho' not in fault, fear punishment, Are useful servantsâSuch as nothing fear When once they merit punishment, embrace Most foolish counsels: take to their heels and fly: But if once caught, heap up a hoard of punishment, Which they ne'er could of their own propertyâ From little faults at first, scraping a treasure For their own backsâMy resolution is To have the fear of punishment before me, And keep my back as free from stripes as may be: Back, be advis'd by me, keep on thy cloaths; When the storm falls on others, thou'lt be dry. As servants choose to have their master be, Such is he. Good to the good, but to the bad Cruel and harsh. Such are our rogues at home. They're lavish of their backs, their only property. Stripe-bearing villains! when they're call'd upon To see their master home, then 'tis, I won'tâ Plague me notâOh! I know where you are goingâ Somewhere you're longing to be gone, by Hercules! Yes, mule, you will to pasturage abroad. Taught to behave, from these I reap advantage. So must be goneâOut of so many slaves, I am the only one to meet my master. When he hears this, they'll rue it in the morning, When their backs bear the spoils of the bull's hide; But I had rather theirs should have't than mine, And see them hide-bound, than myself be rope-boundâ SCENE II. Enter another Servant. Serv. [to Phan.] Hold youâstop presently, and look behind you. Phan. Trouble me notâ Serv. How scornful is the monkey? Phan. And if I am, I am so to myself, And please myselfâWhat business is't of yours? Serv. What, will you stop or no, you dirty parasite? Phan. Why parasite? Serv. Ask why? because a dinner Will draw you any whereâYou bear it high For you're our master's favourite. Phan. Ay, marry! Your eyes ache at me, don't they?â Serv. And why so? Phan. The smoke is troublesomeâ Ser. Peace, peace, deceiver! Coiner of nought but leadâ Phan. All this won't make me Return you back ill wordsâMy master knows me. Were you not drunk, you'd not abuse me thus. Serv. Why should I curry favour with a slave, That shews me none? Phan. Go with me to my masterâ You scoundrel, youâ Serv. Nay, nay, Phaniscus, peace! No more of this, I beg youâ Phan. I have done:â I'll knock. [knocks.] Hola! none of you, to prevent My breaking down the door? Who comes to open it? No body stirsâ'Tis like such rascal's manners. But I'll be more upon my guardâSome one May rush out of the house, and use me ill. There's no such rioting among the guests As was but now. I hear no musick-girl Tuning her pipesânor any soul besidesâ Enter THEUROPIDES. Theu. [apart.] Hey! what's the matter here? What want these men Here at my house? what are they peeping after? What would they have?â Phan. I'll knock againâHola! Open the doorâWhat not yet open it?âTranioâ Theu. What mummery is this? Phan. What! not yet open't? We're come to fetch our master Callidamates. Theu. What are you at, my lads, and why d'ye knock The door down thus?â Phan. Our master's here a feasting. Theu. Feasting! Within?âYour master?â Phan. Yes, within.â Theu. You drive the jest too far, my lad.â Pha. We're come To fetch him homeâ Theu. To fetch whom? Phan. Why, our masterâ Prithee how often must I tell you so? Theu. You're a good ladâBut, no body lives hereâ Phan. Don't a young gentleman, whose name's Philolaches, Live in this house?â Serv. The old man's sure crack-brain'dâ Phan. Father, you're mischievously out; unless They mov'd this day, or yesterday, I'm sure That here he livesâ Theu. What, when no soul has been Within the house these six months? Serv. Sure you dream. Theu. I?â Serv. Youâ Theu. Be not impertinent: I'd talk With this young man hereâ Phan. Soâno soul lives there?â Theu. No,âno bodyâ Phan. Yet yesterday, the day Before, four, five, six days ago, e'er since His father went abroad, he has ne'er desisted One three day's space, eating and drinking hereâ Theu. What say you?â Phan. Ne'er desisted three days space To eat and drink hereâto live quite like Greeks; To bring in wenches, fidlers, musick-girlsâ Theu. And who has done all this?â Phan. Philolaches.â Theu. Who? What Philolaches? Phan. He, whom I take To be the son of old Theuropidesâ Theu. Ah me! Undone, if what he says be true! I must enquire fartherâThis Philolaches, (Whoe'er he be) d'ye say, has made a trade Here in this house, of drinking with your master? Phan. I tell you, hereâ Theu. Thou dost not seem a fool, My lad; and yet thou art oneâI suspect you've turn'd Into some tipling house yourself, and drank More than sufficientâ Phan. What?â Theu. A caution only, Lest you too rashly enter others houses. Phan. I know where I'm to go, and whence I came, Philolaches lives here, son of Theuropides: Who, when his father went abroad to trade, Made free a musick-girlâ Theu. Philolaches! Phan. Ayâand her name was Philematium. Theu. And how much cost she? Serv. Thirty talentsâ Phan. Noâ But minÃ¦, by Apollo!â Theu. Did Philolaches, Say you, give thirty minÃ¦ for a mistress? Phan. Ay, so I sayâ Theu. And gave her strait her freedom? Phan. That too.â Theu. And that e'er since his father went, He has been in daily riots with your master? Phan. Yes.â Theu. And has bought that house? Pha. I say not that. Theu. And given earnest for it forty minÃ¦? Phan. Nor say I thatâ Theu. Ah! friend, you have undone me! Pha. It is no more than he has done his father. Theu. You say the truthâWould it were all a lie tho'! [aside. Phan. His father's friend as it should seemâ -Theu. Alas! You shew how great the misery of that fatherâ [apart. Pha. This is a flea-biteâThirty minÃ¦âNothing To all his feastingsâHe has undone his father. One single slave of his, that Tranio there, Most execrable villain! he alone Would the revenue wast of Hercules. I'm griev'd, by Pollux' temple, for his father: When he knows all, 'twill burn him like a coal. Theu. Yes, if 'twere trueâ Phan. What should I get by lying? Hola!âwithin thereâsome one ope' the door! Theu. Why knock you there, when no body's within? Phan. Perhaps they're gone to revel somewhere else. Let us be goneâ Theu. What! are you marching off? Your freedom is the best cloak to your back. Phan. I want no cloak, nor covering to my back, But my respect, and duty to my masterâ [Exeunt Phan. and Servant. Theu. Undone, by Hercules! No need of talking. By what I hear, I've voyag'd it, not to Egypt, But to some desart; the world's end, indeed!

Theu. And no news there to-day? Simo. O, yesâgreat news. Theu. AyâWhat?âWhat?â Simo. Why, I saw them carrying out A dead man to be buriedâ Theu. News indeed! Simo. What's more, they said he was alive just now. Theu. You're crazy! Simo. None but the idle ask for news. Theu. I do, because I'm just come from abroad. Simo. I am engag'd, so cannot ask you home To supâ Theu. No need. Simo. But if not ask'd elsewhere, I'll sup with you to-morrowâ Theu. Nor needs that. At present, if no better you're engag'd, Attend to meâ Simo. With all my heartâ Theu. I know You've had these forty minÃ¦ of Philolachesâ Simo. I?âNot one single drachma, to my knowledge. Theu. Not from my servant Tranio? Simo. Much less him. Theu. That which he gave for earnestâ Simo. Sure you dream. Theu. I?âRather you, who would by this pretence Make void the bargainâ Simo. Bargain?â Theu. Ayâth'affair My son transacted with you in my absenceâ Simo. He in your absence an affair with me! What?âWhen?â Theu. I owe you eighty silver minÃ¦. Simo. Not me, by Hercules!âBut if so, why pay me. Faith must be kept: never deny the factâ Theu. I don't deny itâand, in troth, I'll pay it. You'll not deny the forty of it paidâ Simo. Look in my face, I beg you, and now answerâ Your servant said, you'd thoughts of marrying of Your son; and so, intended building hereâ Theu. Here!âthat I'd thoughts of building?â Simo. So he said. Theu. Ah me! I'm goneâI have not voice to cry. Help, neighbours, help; I'm ruin'd; I'm undoneâ Simo. Tranio I warrantâ Theu. Has confounded all. Couzen'd us both, and shamefully, to-dayâ Simo. What say you?â Theu. Nay, 'tis just as I relateâ He has this day compleatly chous'd us both. Now do your best to assist meâHelp, I beg youâ Simo. What would you have?â Theu. Go with me, I beseech you. Simo. Command meâ Theu. Let me have your slaves t'assist, And, with them, scourgesâ Simo. Take 'emâ Theu. And I'll tell you, At the same time, in what a shameful manner, This rascal has impos'd upon us both. [Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter TRANIO. Things to a crisis come, the timid man Is not worth e'en a nut-shell. Tho' I scarce Know what the expression meansâSoon as my master Dispatch'd me out of town to fetch his son, I stole a private way into our garden: Open'd a door that's in the narrow passage, And, men and women, our whole regiment, Conducted out. When I'd thus rais'd the siege, And brought my little garrison off safely, I thought it most adviseable to form A senate of that jolly companyâ This done, they banish'd me the senate-house. Soon as I found th'affair must be decided In my own court, I e'en resolv'd to act As others in like case; when things are doubtful, And all's embroil'd, embroil them more and more, Till they can ne'er be settled; for I see There's no concealing this from old Theuropides.â But hark! our neighbour's door!âWhat noise?âMy master! I'll step aside, and try to overhear him. [goes aside. Enter THEUROPIDES. Theu. [to Simo's slaves.] Stand here, upon this spot, behind the door, That, soon as I shall call, you may rush forth. Come, have your manacles in readinessâ I'll wait before the door for this same sharper, Who has been so smart upon me; if I live I'll make his hide smart for it in return. Tra. [apart.] Yes, all is outâLook, Tranio, to thyself; And take care what thou dostâ Theu. When my chap comes, I will go cunningly to work with him. Not let him see at once, I know his roguery, But throw my line to catch him. I'll dissemble That I know ought about it. [apart. Tra. Cunning rogue! There's not a cleverer fellow in all Athens. The art of man may as soon make impression Upon a stone as himâI'll speak to himâ Theu. Wou'd he were here!â Tra. [apart.] 'Troth, if 'tis me you want, I'm ready to attend youâ Theu. Tranio there! The business? Sayâ Tra. The country sparks are coming. Philolaches will presently be here. Theu. He comes most opportunelyâHere's our neighbour; A sorry fellow, as it seems to me, A shameless oneâ Tra. How so? Theu. Denies his knowledge Of youâ Tra. Denies? Theu. And that you ever paid him A single drachmaâ Tra. Psha! You're playing on me. He don't deny itâ Theu. How! Tra. I know you're joking. He can't deny itâ Theu. Yes, by Pollux' temple! Denies it; and that he e'er sold the house. Tra. What! and deny he e'er receiv'd the money? Theu. And offers, if I please, to take his oath He neither sold the house, nor e'er took earnest. Again, I nam'd the sumâRepeatedâ Tra. Wellâ What says he then? Theu. Says? That he'll give his slaves All round the tortureâ Tra. Psha! he'll never do it. Theu. In troth he will. Tra. Defy him then at law. Theu. I'll try to-morrow, that I am determin'dâ Tra. Leave but the man to meâ Theu. In the mean time, What if I call assistanceâ Tra. That before Should have been doneâI insist upon't, your son Demand possession straitâ Theu. But first I'll put The servants to the torture. Tra. Aye, that's rightâ In the mean time, I'll seize upon this altarâ [runs to an altar. Theu. Why so?â Tra. You're very dullâWhy, that the rogues When put to th'torture, fly not to't for sanctuary. Here I'll keep guard, lest it all come to nothing. Theu. Riseâ Tra. Pardon meâ Theu. Seize not the altar, prayâ Tra. Why so? Theu. I'll tell youâ'Tis the thing I want, That they take refuge thereâE'en let them have it: I shall the easier get the judge to fine him. Tra. Do as you pleaseâAnd yet, Sir, why should you A stirrer be of strife? You do not know The dreadful consequences of the law! Theu. Get upâCome hitherâGive me your advice On an affairâ Tra. I'll give you my advice from hence. My wits are best about me, when I'm sitting. Besides, advice is given with greater sanction From holy placesâ Theu. Rise, nor trifle thus. Look on my faceâ Tra. I do soâ Theu. Well, d'you see it? Tra. I doâand see too, if a third man come, And set his trade of cunning up against us, He would be starv'dâ Theu. Why so? Tra. Because he'd find No businessâWe are both such masters in it. Theu. I'm ruin'd! Tra. What's the matter?â Theu. You've deceiv'd me. Tra. How so?â Theu. Yes, yesâYou've wip'd my nose most nicely. Tra. [apart.] Did I do't well?âWhat is it snotty still? Theu. You've wip'd my very brain out of my head, For I have got to the root of all your rogueriesâ By Hercules! not only to the root, But rooted out the rootâBy Pollux' temple! Not unreveng'd this day shall passâThis instant, Rascal, I'll order fire and faggot round you. Tra. Let it aloneâI'm better boil'd than roastedâ Theu. I'll make thee an example!â Tra. What! because I'm perfect, you will make me an example. Theu. Answer me; say, how did I leave my son When I went hence? Tra. Left him?âWith feet, hands, fingers, Ears, eyes, mouth, lips.â Theu. That is not what I ask. Tra. 'Tis what I answer tho', and nothing else. But see, your son's companion, Callidamates, Is coming hitherâIf you'd ought with me, Ask me your questions then, when he is byâ SCENE II. Enter CALLIDAMATES. Cal. Soon as I'd buried drowsiness, and slept off The night's debauch, Philolaches inform'd me His father was return'd; and how his servant Had, e're he could arrive, impos'd upon himâ He dreads, he tells me, to appear before him; And I'm deputed from our company Ambassador of peace to the old manâ And, apropos! he's hereâHealth to Theuropides! I'm glad you're safe arriv'dâYou sup To-day with us?â Theu. The same to Callidamates. As to your supper, I'm oblig'd to youâ Cal. But you will comeâ Tra. Promise him, master mine; If you don't chuse it, I'll go in your steadâ Theu. Rascal! still sneering!â Tra. What, because I offer To go to supper for you?â Theu. You shan't go. I'll have you hang'd as you deserve, you villain. Cal. Come let this pass, and go with me to supper. Tra. Say you will come?âWhat, master, not a word? Cal. Fool of all fools! Why do you refuge take There at that altar?â Tra. For his coming frighted me. Now, master, say, what have I done? Here stands An umpire 'twixt usâLet's debate the matter. Theu. My son you have corruptedâThat I sayâ Tra. [to Cal.] Why, do but hearâHe has been to blame, I own, Has freed his mistressâtaken money up While you was absentâspent itâBut in this, Has he done more than other youth of rank? Theu. I must take care how I engage with you, You are too sly an orator for me. Cal. Let me then act as judge in this affairâ Get up; and I'll sit thereâ Theu. Do by all means. Take on yourself the course, make it your ownâ Tra. Is there no trick in this?âBut I consent, So from my fears he free me; and those fears He take upon himself, and make his own. Theu. I value nothing but the ways he took To play upon his masterâ Tra. That's the best on't. I glory in itâGrey heads should be wiserâ Theu. What shall I do? Should Demipho my friend, Philonides, orâ Tra. Tell them how your servant Deceiv'd you neatly, 'twere a subject fit For any Comedyâ Cal. Peace but a little, 'Tis my turn now to speakâAttendâ Theu. Be't soâ Cal. Of your son's friends you know I am the first; To me then he applied; for he's asham'd To look you in the face, as he is conscious Of what he has done, and that you know it all. Pardon, I beg, these follies of his youth: He is your sonâYou are not now to learn That at that time of life, such pranks are frequent. What he has done, he has done with us in common: We're all to blameâThe principal and interest, The whole expence attending on this mistress, All, we'll repayâShare it alikeâThe loss Shall all be ours, and not a drachma yours. Theu. No orator could influence me more. Nor am I angry with Philolaches, Nor any thing resentâEe'n in my sight, Wench, drink, and do your pleasuresâIf he's but Asham'd of his extravagance, I'm satisfiedâ Tra. And I'm asham'dâBe satisfied with that.â What will be now my fate?â Theu. Tied for the scourge, Dirt, as you meritâ Tra. What, tho' I'm asham'd? Theu. As I'm alive, I'll be the death of thee, By Hercules!â Cal. Come, grant a general pardon. For my sake pardon Tranio his offence. Theu. Any thing else you easier might command, Than not permit me to return him evil, This scoundrel! for his evil deedsâ Cal. Nay, pardon him. Theu. See how the villain keeps his postâ Cal. Be quiet, If you've your senses leftâBe quiet, Tranioâ Theu. Do you be quietâUrge this thing no fartherâ The lash shall quiet himâ Cal. In truth no need.â Let me prevail on youâ Theu. Insist not on it. Cal. By Hercules! I beg youâ Theu. Press me not. Cal. Vain's your refusal, this one only faultâ Pardon this oneâI beg it for my sake. Tra. And why so loth to pardon? As if I Should not commit another fault to-morrowâ And then, you'll have a right to punish me For this and that at onceâ Cal. Let me prevail. Theu. About your business thenâBegone, unpunish'd: But hear me, thank him for itâNow, spectators, The Play is finish'dâGive us your applause. End of The Apparition.</field>
