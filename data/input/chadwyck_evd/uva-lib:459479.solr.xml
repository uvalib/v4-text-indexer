      <field name="fulltext">Prologus. I Knowe that this worshipful Audience, Is at this time togither congregate: Of our practise to haue intelligence, And with the same them selues to recreate. God graunt vs grace the same wel to publicate. But for them that haue slept at Parnassus: This facultie is more meet for them then for vs Pandite pierides vestro sacra ostia vita. Open your holy doores O pleasant Muses, Direct our tungs to speak eloquently: Uertues to praise and to touch abuses, Deuiding either of them plain and directly. That it may appeer to all our Audience euidently. That this matter which we now go about: By your inspiration was first found out. Oh that with some grace you would vs inspire, And dele with vs as with Orpheus you delt: Then should all affections haue their desire, For through his Musick he made stones to melt, No kinde of pain in Hel then the soules felt. For he played so pleasantly with his Harp: That they forgate their paines greeuous and sharp. Tantalus forgate his hunger and thirst, Sisiphus left of rolling his Stone: Ixion tormented among the wurst, Forgate his wheel that he was hanged on. The woman Belides left woork anon: Whose labour was continually to fil a Tun: Whereout by clefts the licour stil dooth run. These fables wherfore doo I call to minde? Truely because I desire with all my hart: That our English Meeter may be of such kinde, Bothe to leaue all greeuousnes and smart. And also to be pleasant in euery parte. That those which come for recreation: May not be void of their expectation. Poets fained Mercurius to haue wings, bothe on his hed and on his heeles also: For liuely and swift he was in all things, Appeering rather to flee then to go: Of him they fain many goodly things mo. But for our purpose this shall serue this season: and why I speak, you shall knowe the reason. Mercurius is the God of eloquence, By whome I vnderstand the ministers of talke: Such must haue the wings of intelligence, In their heds before their tungs to far doo walke. The daunger of rash speech they must wisely calke. When, where, and to whome they speak they must note: Before that any thing passe out of their throte. As Mercurius hath wings vpon his hed, So hath he wings on his heeles redy to flye: When affections standeth in reasons sted, Reporters of tales vse eft soones to lye, The heeles affections doo also signifye. The wings doo alwaies reason comprehend: Which vnto Uertue ought to condescend. Few woords to wise men are sufficient, Without a cause I giue not this monition: Unto good men it is plain and euidient, That many men haue that lewd condition. By their euil words to bring good men into suspition. By their vndiscrete talke they doo much harme: Because they want reason thir tungs to charme. Let this passe and go we to the Argument, Which we wil declare in woords generall: Now such as haue a learned iudgement, Knowe that among the Poets comicall, In breef sentence it was vsuall. To showe the whole contents of the Comedye: In the argument which did wel verily. But our tungs hath not so comely a grace, In that point, as hath the Latin and Greek: We cannot like them our sentences eloquently place, That our Poets to their Orators may be like As they knowe wel which for such matters doo seek. But to doo our best, indeed we wil not neglect: Trusting that wise men the same wil accept. Our title is Inough is as good as a feast, Which Rethorically we shall amplyfye: So that it shall appeer bothe to moste and least That our meaning is but honestie, Yet now and then we wil dally merily. So we shall please them that of mirth be desirous: For we play not to please them that be curious. For a Preface I fear I am to long But I haue said that I wil say now: The Worldly man is frolike lusty and strong, Who wil showe his qualities before you, Stowt he is and in any wise wil not bow. Beholde yonder he commeth into this place: Therfore thus I finish our simple Preface. Finis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Worldly man stout and frolike. Vvorldly man. Because I am a man indewed with treasure, Therfore a worldly man men doo me call: In deed I haue riches and money at my pleasure, Yea, and I wil haue more in spight of them all. A common saying better is enuy then rueth, I had rather they should spite then pitty me: For the olde saying now a dayes proueth trueth, Naught haue naught set by as dayly we see. I wis I am not of the minde as some men are, Which look for no more then wil serue necessitie: No against a day to come I doo prepare, That when age commeth I may liue merily. Oh saith one inough is as good as a feast, Yea, but who can tel what his end shalbe? Therfore I count him wurse then a Beast, That wil not haue that in respect and see. As by mine owne Father an example I may take, He was belooued of all men and kept a good house: Whilst riches lasted, but when that did slake, There was no man that did set by him a Louse. And so at such time as as he from the world went, I mene when he dyed he was not worth a grote: And they that all his substance had spent, For the value of xij. pence would haue cut his throte. But I trowe I wil take heed of such, They shall go ere they drink when they come to me: It dooth me good to tel the chinks in my hutch, More then at the Tauern or ale house to be. Heauenly man. God careth for his as the Prophet Dauid dooth say, And preserueth them vnder his merciful wing: The Heauenly I mene, that his wil doo obay, and obserue his holy commaundements in all thing. Yet not for our sakes, nor for our deseruing. But for his owne name sake openly to declare: that all men heer on Earth ought to liue in his feare. VVorldly man. This same is one of our iolly talkers, That prattleth so much of Heauen and Hel: Oh, I tel you these are godly walkers, Of many straunge things they can tel. They passe men, yea Angels they excel, Sir, are you not called the Heuenly man? I haue been in your c?pany ere now but I c?not tel whan Heuenly man. Yes certainly Sir, that is my name, Unworthy of any such title I doo confesse: God graunt that I may deserue the same, And that my faults I may amend and redresse. Therfore now the trueth doo you heer expresse, Is not the Worldly man your name? Vvorldly man. Yea in deed Sir, I am the very same. Contentation. From the Heauenly man I cannot be long absent, Which in Gods promises hath his consolation: Considering that he alwaies is content, Patiently to suffer Gods visitation. For vnderstand you? my name is Contentation. Whome the worldly man dooth mock and deride: And wil not suffer him once in his minde to abide. VVorldly man. This same is the Grandsire of them all, This is he that will through water and fire: Good reasoning betwixt vs now hear you shall, For to folowe him he wil me ernestly require, But he shalbe hanged or he haue his desire. You are welcome Sir, sauing my quarrel in deed: You haue reported of me much more then you need. Contentation. Nothing but trueth Sir, certainly I haue said, Oft times I haue co?celled you your couetousnes to leue But my woords as fethers in the winde you haue waid, And stuck to them as Glue to the water dooth cleaue. But take heed the rewarde therof you shall receiue. Once again I aduertise thee to be content: And giue thanks to God for that he hath thee sent. Vvorldly man. I pray you be you content for I am pleased, And meddle yon no more with me then I doo with you: Heauenly man. To be angry without a cause, wtout mends must be eased We wilbe more ernest then euer we were now. Wo (saith our Sauiour) to those that are rich, Which therin onely haue their consolation: He curseth them not be cause they haue much, but because they receiue it not with contentation. Building therwith to them selues a good foundation, That is to lay heer on Earth treasure great store: to purchace a kingdome that lasteth euer more. Vvorldly man. Passion of me maisters, what would you haue me to doo? You are fond fellowes indeed as euer I knew: If I should not take paines, ride, run and go For my liuing, what therof would insue? A begger should I dye, maisters this is true, Then my wife and children that I leaue behinde: I fear me at your hands, small releef should finde. Heauenly man. I haue been yung (saith Dauid) and now am olde, Yet the righteouse forsaken I neuer did see: Nor their seed begging Bread I did not beholde, Therfore your minde to the Prophets dooth not agree, Cast all thy burden and care (saith Christe) on me. And I wil prouide to keep thee from daunger and strife: Onely seek thou to liue a godly and good life. Contentation. When Solon was asked of Cressus the King, What man was moste happy in this vale terestrial: To the end he seemed to attribute that thing, When men be assosiate with treasures selestiall. Vvorldly man. By the beginning no man can iudge the same Solon dooth say, That any man is happy that beareth breath: But yet by the end partely iudge we may, For true happines (saith he) consisteth after death. Heauenly man. If this be true as vndoutedly it is, What men are more wicked, wretched and miserable: Then those that in riches account their blisse, Beeing infected with Ambition that sicknes vncurable. Contentation. The treasure of this world we may wel compare, To Circes the Witch with her crafty cawtilitie: Wherwith many mens mindes so poysoned are, That quite they are caryed to all infidelitie, They are coniured so in deed and bewitched so sore, That treasure is their trust, yea, hope and delight: Inough serueth them not til that they haue more, So against Contentation they stil striue and fight. Heauenly man. Though she Worldly man doo folowe their lust, Crying on Earth is our felicitie and pleasure: Yet God dooth so rule the harts of the Iust, That their study is, cheefly to get Heauenly treasure. Vvorldly man. Freends I take you bothe for honest men, I promise you I would be glad to doo for the best: Mary then I take care which way and when, I may get treasure therewith to liue in rest. Oh, me thinks it is a very pleasant thing, To see a great heap of olde Angels and Crownes: When I haue store of money I can be mery and sing, For money as men say winneth both Citties and townes. Heauenly man. Alas why should you not haue that in estimation, Which God hath prepared for his deer elect: Should not our mindes rest in ful contentation, Hauing trust in that treasure moste high in respect, Saint Paule whome the Lord so high dooth erect. Saith, it passeth the sence, our memoryes and minde: Much lesse can our outwarde eyes the same finde. As for the treasure that you possesse heer, Through ficklenes of Fortune soon fadeth away: The greatest of renown and moste worthy Peer, Somtime in the end falleth to misery and decay. Recorde of Dionisius a King of much fame, Of the valiant Alexander, and Ceaser the strong: Recorde of Tarquinus which Superbus had to name: And of Heliogabalus that ministred with wrong, To resite them all it would be very long. But these be sufficient plainly to prooue: How soon and vncertainly riches dooth remooue. Contentation. It is true, and therfore a minde wel content, Is great riches as wise king Salomon dooth say: For we haue seen of late dayes this canker pestilent Corrupting our Realme to our vtter decay. Ambition I mene which cheefly dooth reign, Amongst those who should haue been example to other: Yea we see how the Breethern they did disdain, And burned with fire, the Childe with the mother. It is often seen that such monstrous Ambition, As spareth not to spil the blood of the innocent: Wil not greatly stick to fall to sedition, The determinations of God therby to preuent, But God I trust shall disapoint their intent. And ouerthrowe the power of fading treasure: And cause vs al to wish for the heauenly pleasure. Heauenly man. O you ancient men whome God hath furnished wt fame, Be ye alwaies mindeful to walke in the waies of the Iust, And ad euer more vertue to your honest name, And at no hand be ouer come with couetouse or lust, But in Gods holy promise put confidence and trust. And then double felicitie at the last we shall possesse: And then in all Earthly dooings God shall giue good successe Ye poor men and commons walke in your vocation, Banish fond fantasyes which are not conuenient: Settle your mindes with inough to haue contentation, Considering that that leadeth to treasures moste excellent, For these are vncertain, but they are moste parmanent. Your necessitie apply with treasure, faith and trust: And you shall haue inough alwaies among the Iust. Vvorldly man. And indeed inough is as good as a feast, Good Lord how your woords haue altred my minde: A new hart me thinks is entred in my brest, For no thought of mine olde in me I can finde. I would to God you would take me in your company, And learne me how I may be an heauenly man: For now I perceiue this world is but vanitie, Let a man therfore make of it asmuch as he can. Contentation. Doo you speak as you think? and as you minde doo you say? Could you be content to lead the rules of a godly life? Vvorldly man. I doo mean it truly and I wil study them night and day, For I regarde neither treasure, Children nor wife. Heauenly man. Giue me your hand then togither let vs departe: Vvorldly man. And I wil wait on you sir, with all my hart. Exeunt Ambo. Enter Temeritie, Inconsideration, and Precipitation singing this Song. When Couetouse is busy, Then we three be all mery, for he dooth trimly inuent: To make vs fine frolike cheer Be vitailes neuer so deer, and all our money clene sp?t Therfore we spare for no cost We c? be trusted of our hoste For shillings xx. and one: Couetouse hath a good wit, He findeth a mene to pay it, wh? all our money is gone. Therfore trole the boule to me, With huf childe &amp; haue to thee, the longest liuer pay all: Our trust is in Couetise, For he is prudent and wise, therfore money cannot fall. Oh Couetouse prud?t Prince, All str?g walles yu doost c?uince and rulest them euery one: Thou doost driue many a drift, And makest for vs much shift, wh? all our money is gone. Enter Couetouse the Vice alone. At Black heath feeld where great Golias was slain, The Moon lying in childebed of her last Sonne: The Tiborne at warwick was then King of Spain, By whome the land of Canaan then was wun. It hapned between Peterborow and Pentecost, About such time as Iuy was made of Wormwood: That Childes woork in Basil wood with fire was lost, And all through the treason of false Robin Hood. That saw Sir Guy of Warwick, and Colebrand, Which fought against the Sun and stopped his light: Yea (quoth Hobgoblin) let me take them in hand, Children, children not able to resist my might A wunderful bloodshed was in those dayes, For Saint Steephen fought against the golden Knight: In so much that Peeter was fain to giue his Keyes, To those God knowes that had to them no right. With the greef of that, all the Saints in Heauen, Proclamed open warres at Barnard in the feeld: They fought from six of the clock to eleuen, Or euer the Traitors would giue ouer and yeeld. But to say there was triumph, in faith there was, Saint Steephen the yunger was made Captain of the Garde: Wunderful it was to see such things he brought to passe, As I am sure the like of them ye neuer heard. By gisse (quoth Saint Steephen) it was time to trudge, Fryer Francis took his flight to Paules steeple: In faith he was euen with them for an olde grudge, For he caried away the Wethercock in spight of the people. Then was I dubbed Knight at Kinistone, And made Officer of all Courts and lawes: I gaue Offices and liuings many a one, Mary in deed you may say, it was for a cause. In faith the same day that Midsommer was maried, I neuer laughed better in my life: For euen sudainly away Saint Vncumber caried, Bothe the Bridgroome and the Bride his wife. No remedy on Gods name but I must beare them c?pany, Cheer, in faith there was, cheer in boules: And who was minstrel but Saint Anthony, He made melodye for all Christen soules. A quarter of a yeer we taried there in the tent, Wherin we had Capricorne baked like red Deer: I taried so long til I was shent, Iesu how they cryed out of me there. Wel, I must abrode among my freends, Euery houre til I come they think a day: I wil go among then to fulfil their mindes, Fare ye wel Gossip I must needs away. Temeritie. What brother Couetouse? whether away so fast? I sawe you not by the Masse, til I was almoste past. Couetouse. What mine owne Brother Temeritie: I reioice to see you, I swere by the Trinitie. Inconsideration. For thee we three haue taken great thought, Precipitation. Lord, how far about for you we haue sought? Couetouse. And I pray you where haue you three sought for mee? Precipitation. In the Kings bench and in the Marshalsee. Yea, and in all the Counters, and at Newgate: For these are places meet for thine estate. Couetouse. I perceiue wel it must be my chaunce: Abooue all your kinsfolke you to inhaunce. Your place is at Saint Thomas awatrings: Or els at Wapping beyond Saint Katherins. There wil I dub you Knights of the Halter: Among your mates there strongly to talter. Inconsideration. You are to blame in faith Precipitation: For you began this fond communication. Couetouse. You are Knaues to vse such salutation: Temeritie. Why Brother we speke for your consolation. Couetouse. Speak what you wil, euen with you I can make: Speak you in mirth, and in mirth I doo it take. But by the mas and if you go about me to flowt: I wil make the better of all you three a Lout. Precipitation. No Sir, no, we came not hether you to molest: Our busines I tel you is very ernest. Inconsideration. By Gods ares true, if now we make not shift: We are all foure like to haue a great lift. Temeritie. If euer Couetouse were in daunger of punishment: He standeth now at the point of banishment. Couetouse. Sancte Blaci, you make me much to muse: Passion of me Sirs, why what newes? Precipitation. I think the day of Iudgement be now at hand: For it was neuer thus since the worlde did stand. The worldly man hath forsaken Couetouse clene: And vnto Contentation, and Inough he dooth lene. Couetouse. What dooth he? Benidicite is this true? Inconsideration. Yea faith, he is quite becommen a new. More ouer with the heauenly man he is associate: Where he studieth ye rules of godly life erly &amp; late. Couetouse. Body of me Precipitation, fetch me my gown: My Cap, and my Chain, I wil to the Town. Mary Sir, in deed it is time to stir Coles: I wil go neer to fetch some of th? out of their holes. Temeritie. Haste maketh waste Brother Couetouse ye wot: No looue so soon colde, as that is moste hot. I warrant you the worldly man wil soon be wery: For they wil not suffer him once to be mery. And verily he is inclined to be nought: therfore think not that by th? he wil long be taught Couetouse. Now by the masse, of one that should haue sapi?ce, I neuer heard none vtter such a foolish sentence. Knowe you not that when so euer a Sinner dooth repent: That God forgiueth him his wickednes incontinent. Inconsideratoin. True in deed as heer tofore hath been seen: Many haue been made heauenly that worldly haue been. Precipitation. Heer is your Gown, your Chain and your Cap: Couetouse. Body of me, but for shame thou shouldst beare me a rap. Whorson theef, the Deuil in Hel thee choke: What meanest thou foolish knaue to bring my Cloke. Temeritie, Why my brother is blinde, I holde you a Crown: Body of me he knoweth not a Cloke from a Gown. Inconsideration. Tush maisters he was stirring in the morning betime: At foure of the Clock in a Seller he was saying of Prime. Precipitation. I blame him not though betimes he steer: For he is made Ale cunner in our Parish this yeer. His paines is so great in tasting of drink: That many times his eyes into his hed doo sink. And then he looketh pretily as narow as a Crowe: I tel you he can scarce reed the letters of his Crosrowe. Couetouse. Body of me, you are Knaues all three: Take Gown, Chain, Cap and all for me. I wil be eu? with you all I swere by Gods mother: Chuse you, shift how you can one for an other. Be going out. I warrant you I shalbe able to shift for my self: Or els you may say I were a foolish elf. Temeritie. Holde him. Why brother, you said you would all things wel take: Couetouse. Yea but I would not haue you your fool me to make. Come in again For you knowe wel inough that of you all three: I am worthy the gouernour and Ruler to be. Couetouse (saith the wise man) is the root of all euil: Therfore Couetouse is the cheefest that c?meth from ye deuil. But this is that Knaue I mene Precipitation: But I wil be euen with him I swere by the Passion. Precipitation. Cum in. I am sory by my trueth that you are so sore offended: What Sir, if a fault be made it shalbe amended. Couetouse. Nay faith I am an Ale cunner, or some drunken fool: I am no better but your courage I wil coole. He fighteth with them bothe with his Daggar. That witlesse knaue to, Inconsideration, He was beginner of this disputation. But it is no matter once or Christmas day: I wil be euen with you, be as be may. Inconsideration. Lay holde on him What worshipful M. Couetouse are you angry with me? I am sory for it man, what can I more be? Hang me vp by the neck like a strong theef: If euer I speak any woord that shall put you to greef. Couetouse. I would doo for you Sirs, for I looue you all three, Mary then I look that as I am you should accept me Temeritie. By my troth Brother, I dare say none of vs all: But that to doo as you bid vs, redy finde you shall. Couetouse. Mary then on good feloship let vs like freends agree: All. Why abooue all things that desire we. Couetouse. Wil you help then to make me gay? Temeritie As you wil wish it, so we wil you aray. Couetouse. Wil you concent to showe vnto me reuerence? Precipitation. Yea, at all times we wil showe to you our obedience Couetouse. Wil you take me for your maister and hed? Inconsideration. Yea mary Sir, for so it standeth vs in sted. Couetouse. And doo you say as you think in very deed? Temeritie. Yea, that shall you prooue in all time of need. Couetouse. First to help on my gown some paines doo you take And then I wil see what curtsie you can make. Inconsideration. It is trim indeed, by the masse in that Gown: Me thinks you be worthy to be Mayor of a town. Couetouse. Say you so? then how like you this countenaunce? Precipitation. Uery comely and like a person of great gouerna?ce Couetouse. Then all is wel, come, come doo your dutye: All three. O worthy Prince Couetouse we humbly salute ye. Couetouse. Body of me, that same wil marre all: Wh? in c?pany I come if Couetouse you doo me call Temeritie. Therfore it is best for vs all to chaunge our names: Precipitation. Or els paraduenture we shall come to shames. Couetouse. Wel, holde your peace, then let me alone: And I wil deuise names for you euery one. (study Sira, nay you gape at me: Temeritie. What shall my name be? Couetouse. You wil haue it or I haue it, wil ye? Sira, thy name shalbe. (study. Precipitation. What I pray you? Couetouse. A shame take thee vnmannerly Lout: Thou camest so hastely thou hast put me out, Nay, that maid looks on me: study Come hether Inconsiderati?, I haue a name for thee Inconsideration. Haue you Sir? I pray you what shall it be? Couetouse. Nay by the masse, it is gone again: Inconsideration. And I would knowe it I tel you very fain. Couetouse. Yea, but you must tary til I haue it: Temeritie, I tel you my Brother hath a braue wit. Couetouse. A shame take th? I haue them now all three: (speak to Inc?sideration C?e hether brother I wil tel you what your n?e shalbe. You knowe yt men now a dayes to reason doo trust: Therfore Reason, your self fr? hence foorth name you must. Temeritie, I knowe wel thy qualitie: Thou art heady, thou shalt be called Agilitie. I study a name for Precipitation if it may hit: Let me see, by my trueth, yu shalt be called Redy wit. Precipitation. An excellent name in deed, for I am redy &amp; quick with a pen: For before I see one I can condemne ten. I passe not for any mans matters or cause: money and wit shall gouern the Lawes. Couetouse. Wel maisters I haue chosen names for eche one of you: But mine owne name I knowe not I make God a vow. How if I call my name Wit or Policy? Temeritie. Mary Sir, that agreeth to your nature exceedingly. Couetouse. Trueth, for what shall the worldly man doo with you three? Except to maintain you, he take in mee. Little worth is Reason, redy wit and Agillitie: Except to maintain them there be a Policy. Sirs you tel me the worldly man is conuerted: Precipitation. Yea faith that for euer from vs he is departed. Couetouse. For euer (quoth he) ha, ha, ha, no, no I warr?t thee I What this geer meaneth ful wel I doo espye. Tush he purposeth to go bothe to heauen and to hel: And feth newes from thence to the people to tel. He wil be a Prophet that was wunt to be a deuil: Temeritie. But his prophecy I think wil prooue but euil. Inconsideration. Wel no more woords, inough is as good as a feast: They say it is perelouse with edge tooles to iest. Couetouse. Now Sirs I wil tel you, this is all my drift, To get the worldly man hether by some shift. Temeritie thou shalt with him thy self acquaint: And what thou canst doo, to him foorth yu shalt paint Uertue is made an errour by Temeritie: For stoutly he standeth against the veritie. For Temeritie learned men doo say: Is a qualitie to doo all things without delay. So that if thou maist get into his habitation: He wil soon be wery of inough and contentation. Then with him shall woork Precipitation: Who is of this propertie and inclination. To see and to doo all with out forecast: Not thinking of things to come or of things past. Therfore after that Temeritie dooth once enter: Thou shalt put thy seruice in aduenter. Then Inconsideration shall get into his minde Who is a qualitie much of the same kinde. He waieth neither the time, person nor place: Neither (as they say) the taile nor the the face Thus if you three within him once be placed: You shall see yt Inough of him shall soon be disgraced Under the name of Policy to enter I doo not dout: And I beeing entred Inough shalbe cast out. For wher Couetouse in any place dooth remain: There content with inough cannot abide certain. So that he shall run hedling into the pit: Dooing all things hedling without modestie or wit. Lo, heer to you my minde I haue disclosed: All haue I said that I haue now purposed. Temeritie. By the faith of my body it is worthyly deuised: Couetouse. In all the haste go thou and be thou disguised. Mary now there commeth an other thing to my rem?braunce Are none of you acquainted with ghostly Ignoraunce? Inconsideration. What he pardy? he is my ghostly Father: Couetouse. I would speak with him so much the rather. For diuers causes that I doo consither: My brother and thou shall departe hence togither. Look you make you trim as fast as you can: And then in haste seek to speak with the worldly man. Inconsideration to ghostly Ignorance, thou shalt resorte: And this message from me to him thou shalt reporte. First that he name him self deuotion: And we wil help him to dignitie and promotion. Charge him not to be out of the way: For we porpose to send for him this present day. Temeritie. For asmuch as you put your trust &amp; c?fidence in me: What I can doo for you, or it be long you shall see. Inconsideration. Where to finde ghostly Ignorance I am sure: Seldome or neuer at home at his owne cure. Precipitation. No, the Sermons that ghostly ignorance hath made: Hath almoste brought all ye Parishes in England out of trade Couetouse. Wel, hye you a pace, that you were gone: Precipitation and I wil tary heer a lone. Temeritie. Fare wel Couetouse til we meet again: Inconsideration. That shall not be long if our purpose we obtain. Couetouse. Nay hear you? God be with you, wil you begone? Body of me you are no better then knaues euery one. Fare wel Couetouse? nay fare wel good Lob: Be going out You haue euen asmuch maners as hath a Dog. Come in Plain Couetouse? this is according to promise is it not? Wel what I intend to doo for it, I wot what I wot. Temeritie. I cry you mercy right worshipful Maister couetise, Moste prudent, politick, sapient and wise. Inconsideration. Pardon vs by my trueth, it was but forgotten: Couetouse. Nay I take it euen thus, soon ripe soon rotten. I am no body with you, but by him I swere: I look the greatest stroke amongst you to bere. Temeritie. Inough is as good as a feast, we are warned I trowe From hence foorth our duties I warrant ye we wil showe, We take our leaue of you noble prince Couetise: The King, Emperour, yea the God of all vice. Inconsideration. Oh worthy visage, and body wel compact: Oh goodly man in wit, work and fact. We simple creatures doo showe to you obedience: Beeing minded to departe vnder your patience. Couetouse. Yea mary, this is some what like the matter: Precipitation. Crafty knaues, how they can a foole flatter. Couetouse. Exeunt Ambo Fare ye wel bothe, giue me your hands one after an other: I looue ye as deerly as the Children of my mother. How saist thou Precipitation? how likest thou this matter? Precipitation. By my trueth I wil tel the trueth, Yea and not flatter. I perceiue wel inough what heer in you doo mene: You wil not leaue til you haue marred him clene. Not onely riches singuler and priuate: But also publike weales you wil spolyate. For I perceiue by your former monition: That through ghostly Ignorance you wil destroy deuotion. I meane true faith, in Gods looue and hope: And cause him in cleer Sun shine, for light to grope. Couetouse. Thou thinkest as trueth is in very deed: I intend no lesse if my deuice may likely speed. There wil I begin and if errour once rage in religion: I warrant thee in publike wele wil soon be deuision. Precipitation Wel, what you intend to me dooth not appertain: My nature is to rage where haste dooth reign. And what causeth haste? but onely Temeritie: That maketh fooles hardy with Securitie. Precipitation foorth dooth this worldly man leade: So that all his affaires be doon rudely on hed. Then Inconsideration bothe night and day: Shall promp him forward nothing at all to wey. Neither to consider his beginning: Neither at the end what shall be the winning. So that if all we doo our proper nature and kinde: He shall not regarde who shall the profit finde. Couetouse. Lupus est in fabula, no more woords. Precipitation. I neuer fear any such kinde of burdes. This is the worldly man I suppose indeed: Enter the Vvorldly man and Inough, let the worldly man stand a far of in a stra?ge attire. Couetouse. To woork wisely with him I see we had need: Vvorldly man. I finde it true as the wise king Saloman dooth say, It is better to haue a little with the fear of the Lord Then to haue much treasure and yet go astray, I mene to decline from Gods holy word. The prouerbe saith inough is as good as a feast, He that hath inough and cannot be content: In my iudgement is worse then a Beast, For he wanteth a good conscience minde &amp; intent. Poorly arayed Inough. The Chariot of Couetouse as Barnard dooth write, On foure wheeles of vices is caried away: And these be the foure vices that he dooth resite, Contempt of God, forgetfulnes of death eche day. Faint courage, and vngentlenes he dooth say. These be the wheeles that to aduersityes cart dooth belong: These haue perswations to begile men many and strong. The same Chariot hath two horses which dooth it draw, The one named Raueny and the other nigardship: Their Carter is Desire to haue, who alwaies dooth claw, By fraude or guile one an other to nip, This Carter hath two cordes to his Whip. The one is Appititite and felicitie for to get: The other is called Dread and fear to forlet. Vvorldly man. When this Chariot gose in the ground of mans minde, He is not once able to think a good thought: For Couetouse dooth the hart so much to lucre binde, That he iudgeth all things to be vain and nought, Except some gain or profit therby be brought. I my self am able to say it, for I doo it knowe: To haue gotten money I studyed to deceiue high and lowe But thanks be to God the Father of all might, Which wil not the death of Sinners as Scripture dooth say It hath pleased him to open vnto me the the true light, Wherby I perceiue the right path from the brode way, Therfore I am content my self for to stay. With Inough which bringeth me to quiet in body &amp; minde: Yea. and all other commodityes there with I doo finde, Inough. Godlines is great riches if a man can be content, When God hath sent him plenty and Inough: Let vs praise him for our food and raiment, And liue godlyly all our liues through, For we must tread the paths of death so sharp and rough. And then shall we be sure to cary as little away: As we brought with vs thus Saint Paule dooth say. Couetouse. Body of me he is meruelouse forgone: We shall haue somwhat to doo with him anon. Precipitation. It was il luck that he came not alone. I would that beggerly knaue in Hel were. Couetouse, Wel let me alone I wil go neer, To cause him of his company to be wery: I haue doon as great acts thrise this yeer, I am not to learne to rowe in Illirans Fery. I wil go to him and thou shalt wait vpon me, Thou shalt hear what a tale to him I wil tel: Precipitation. If thou speed wel now I dare promise the, The Deuil wil giue thee the Crown of hel. Couetouse, God speed you Sir, I pray you might I be so bolde, As to haue a woord or two with you in your eare? Inough. Yea, hardely my freend say what you would. Your minde vnto me you may boldely declare. Couetouse. I pray you are you not acquainted with this gentleman? I would fain speak with him a word or twain alone: I beseech you help me to my request if you can, For I haue haste on my way I must needs be gone. Inough. If you had required a greater thing of me, I would haue doon it for you I tel you certain: Sir, one of yonder men which you doo see, Would speak with you alone very fain. Vvorldly man. I wil go to him and knowe his minde: is it you that would speak with me my freend? Couetouse. Yea forsooth sir? Vvorldly man. What say you to me? Couetouse. Oh Sir, oh good Sir, oh, oh, oh my hart wil breke: Oh, oh, for sorow God wot I cannot speak. VVeep Vvorldly man. What is the matter? wherfore weep you thus? Precipitation. Vveep Pure looue causeth him, Sir I wus. I am sure that be looues you at the hart. Vvorldly man. I thank him truely it is vndeserued on my parte. Gentle freend I pray you ceasse your lamentation: Sure it is a straunge thing to see a man weep on this fasion. Couetouse, Let the Vice weep &amp; houle &amp; make great lam?tati? to the Vvorldly man. I cannot chuse, oh, oh, I cannot chuse: Whow? I c?not chuse if my life I shuld loose. To hear that I hear, oh wel it is no matter: Oh, oh, oh, I am not he that any man wil flatter. Vvorldly man. To hear what you heer, why what hear you of me? Precipitation. Mary sir he heareth yt wunderfully chaunged you be VVorldly man. I am so in deed, for that I giue God the glory: And if you be my freend for my chaunge you are not sory. I trust I haue chosen all for the best: For my former wickednes I hate and detest. Couetouse. Whow, nay I would to God that were the worst: But I shall haue il wil, I think I am accurst. Vvorldly man. I iudge him not to be of a discrete minde: That for the trueth wil be angry with his freend. The talke of talkers tungs I doo not much way: Yet I pray you hartely tel me what they say. Couetouse. Couetouse, couetouse, euery man saith you be: A shame take them all pratling knaues for me. I am of such a nature as no man is but I: To hear my freend il spoken of I had rather dye. Yea wisse man, you are called euen so: All the cuntrey of you speak bothe shame and wo. He was wunt (saith one) to keep a good house: but now (saith an other) there is no liu?g for a mouse Vvorldly man. If this be the wurst, for their talke I doo not care: Let them say so stil hardely and doo not spare. I trust I haue chosen with Mary the better parte: Precipitation. Oh yet good Sir, this greeueth him to the hart. Couetouse. Yea God wot, it is none other, it is none other: I looue you as wel as mine owne borne brother. Think you yt it greeueth me not to hear eche boy and Girle: To say that the worldly man is become a Churle? Vvorldly man. He had need to liue very sircumspectly: That would take vpon him to please all men directly Beholde Inough. Go towards him. Couetouse. Nay hear you, this greeueth me worst so God me saue: (pluck him back. They say you keep company wt euery beggerly knaue Vvorldly man. Wher I keep company they haue nought to doo: As neer as I can into none but honest company I go. See you, I pray you Inough. Couetouse. Nay but hear you, is Inough his name? Vvorldly man. Yea in deed, it is euen the very self same. Couetouse. Saint Dunstone, a man would not iudge it by his cote: Now truely I would not take him to be worth a grote. Hark you, hark you, in faith knowe you not me? Vvorldly man. No truely that I wot of, I did you neuer see. Precipitation. That is maruail in deed the trueth for to tel: I dare say your father knew vs bothe very wel. Couetouse. Did you neuer hear him speak of one Policy? Vvorldly man. Yes that I haue sure an hundred times verily. Couetouse. I am he verily and this your freend Redy wit: With whome to be acquainted for you it is fit. Precipitation. Trueth in deed as Seneca saith wittily: The wise man and not the rich is void of misery. Vvorldly man. Policy and redy wit: now the trueth is so, There is no man liuing that can spare you two. I trust God worketh for me happily in deed: To send me all such things wherof I haue need. For without a redy wit, who can answere make? Without a policy all commodityes wil slake. A redy wit wil soon gather and conceiue: What he shall forsake and what he shall receiue. Teuely now I remember a saying of Tully the deuine: Where he dooth bothe wisdome and learning define. Learning maketh yung men sober (saith he) And it causeth olde men of good comfort to be. Policy is the riches and possession of the poore: Yea, it garnisheth the rich with goodly adore. So that there is no srate calling or degree: That may conueniently without you be. Giue me your hands for you are welcome hartely. I am exceeding ioyful of your good company. Inough, I beseech you bid my freends welcome hether: For from hensfoorth we must dwel all togither. Inough. Be not rash in taking of a freend Aristotle dooth say: Nor when thou haste taken him, cast him not away, Admit not thy freend either high or lowe: Except his behauiour to others thou doost knowe. For look how before he hath serued his other freend: Euen so wil he serue thee also in the end. Vorldly man. Your parables truely I doo not wel vnderstand: Except you mene I shuld haue no freend? but you by me to st?d Inough. Inough is as good as a feast, wel you wot: More then inough: a man needeth not. Whether it be lands, money, freends or store: if he haue inough: what needeth he any more? Couetouse. I perceiue that against vs two you doo grutch: Can a man of policy and redy wit haue to much? The noble king Salomon was rich &amp; had wisdome great store Yet he seassed not dayly to pray to God for more. Precipitation. Get thee store of freends (saith Cicero) for it is deemed: A true freend more then Kinsfolke is to be esteemed. Inough. It is an olde prouerbe and of an ancient time: Which saith, it is not all Golde, that like Golde dooth shine. No more are all freends that freendship pretend: As it approoued with many in the end. Vvorldly man. Yea inough, but I am sure that this policy: And this redy wit are my freends verely. Couetouse. Are we? ye faith there of you may be sure: We are they which your welth shall procure. Inough is not inough without vs two: For hauing not vs, what can inough doo? Inough is maintained by wisdome and policy: Which is contained of a redy wit naturally. Precipitation. Hauing a redy wit and of polycy the skil: You need not to care for this inough except you wil. There is another inough which is inuisible: Which inough, to want is impossible. As for this Inough is inough I cannot deny: But this inough serueth but euen competently. You haue no more now then dooth your self serue: So that your poor Breethern for all you may sterue But inough that commeth by vs twain: Is able your self and many other to sustain. Vvorldly man. Your words are euen as true as the Gospel: As one named Reason of late to me did tel. You may be more heauenly saith he hauing riches: Then if you had nothing the trueth to expresse. &amp; I finde his word? true for wh? almes I wold giue I haue not wherwith the needy to releeue. Inough I haue for my self I cannot say nay: But I would I had more to succour the needy alway Inough. These woords proceed from a couetouse minde: And from a worldly lust which dooth you blinde. was not ye poor widdow for her offring praised more Then all they yt offred of their superfluitie &amp; store. The sacrifice of God as the prophet Dauid dooth say Is a broken hart and a good minde alway. Couetouse. He sayes wel by Lady, yea and like an honest man, But yet Sir, riches to be good, wel prooue I can. For euery man is not called after one sorte: But some are called to prophecy, some to preach &amp; exhorte. And he by that meanes Heauen ioyes to win: But euery man knoweth not that way to walke in. Therfore euery man (as his vocation is) must walke: I am sure that against this you wil not talke. Inough. The greatest bosters are not the best giuers: Nor the ernest preachers are the best liuers. As lucre increaseth riches and honor, So couetouse inlargeth dayly more and more. I knowe s?e in this realme which once were c?tent With poorely inough which God to them had sent. Wishing of a good conscience as they said verily: That God would once again restore the veritie. If it please thee good Lord (said they) thy woord to vs again send And then truely our Couetouse liues we wil amend. But since it hath pleased God, them to welth to restore: They are ten times more Couetouse then they were before. Yea hedling without all consideration: They for Couetouse make some lawes in that nation. Such bying and selling of Leaces and benifices: Such doubling of wares to extreme prices. So shamefully Gods ministers they poule &amp; shaue: That not half inough to liue vpon they haue. But it is an olde saying and a true certainly: it wil not out of the flesh ye is bred in yt bone verily. The worldly man wil needs be a worldly man stil: Wel chuse you I wil let you al?e doo what you wil. I cannot think but those that of me holde scorne: Wil be glad of me or euer the yeer be half worne. Exit Vvorldly man. Mary fare wel? adieu to the deuil: Body of me, he would make me his driuil. Couetouse. You may see what a trusty freend he is: Vvorldly man. A beggerly knaue I warrant you by the blisse. And euen so he and they went about me to make: Within a while I should haue gone to the hedge for a stake. Precipitation. I warrant you that you should haue proued shortly: They would not haue left you one grote nor peny. I maruail you would tary with them any time or season: You are olde inough I trowe to be ruled by reason. Vvorldly man. A shame take them all, I haue spent on them xx. po?d: That I had of money and of mine owne good ground. I am a shamed of my self so God me saue: Because I haue solde almoste all that euer I haue. My freends and companions when I go in the street: So God help me, I am a shamed with them to meet. Couetouse. Passion of me it was time to look about: They would quite haue vndoon you, or els without dout. But I trowe, I trowe, if you wil be ruled by me: What I wil doo for you, or ere it be long you shall see. A thousand, thousand, thousand waies I can inuent: To fetch in double asmuch as you haue spent. Vvorldly man. Be ruled by you? yes heer I doo you bothe imbrace: As mine owne minde to folowe all my liues space. For I tel you plain I am wery of their Schole: Precipitation. It is time for you, els they would haue made you a fool. Vvorldly man. I perceiued no lesse in deed hy the talke of Reason: But so it should haue come to passe in season. Couetouse. And doo you my brother Reason perfitly knowe? Vvorldly man. Yea, and with him one called Agililitie I trowe. Reason came to me, and mihi flectere mentem he said: Sola solet ratio dux fida sophorn est it cannot be denaid. To nature and Reason he dooth open iniury, Which of other men councel dooth seek: God hath giuen men Reason and their wits Policy, To forsake that is il, and to take that he dooth like. Precipitation. And beleeue you not these words to be very true? Vvorldly man. Yes, and I haue thought on them xx. times since I tel you. Oh Sirs me thinks if I had money and treasure again: In faith I would be a liuely lad I tel you plain. Heauenly man (quoth he) let them be heauenly for me: The best heauen is me thinks is rich for to be. Couetouse, In faith it shall cost me and my freends a fall, But you shalbe twise as rich as you were before: We wil doo it to spite them euen with all, Though we doo hundreds wrong therfore. I haue set some aloft in a high place, Which had rather dye I dare wel say: Then one inch of their state should fall or abace, But rather to clime vp higher if they may. Whow, of this world I rule the whole state, Yea faith I gouern all lawes, rites and orders: I, at my pleasure raise war, strife and debate, And again I make peace in all Costes and borders Nay, yet a much more maruail then that, Beholde, see you this little pretty hand? This is an Arme of steele for it ouerthroweth flat, The strongest walles and towers in a whole land. Power I haue lawes to alter and make, And all lawes made are guided by me: All that is doon, is doon wholly for my sake, What strength I haue by this you may see. More ouer I haue in this little hand, The harts of all men &amp; women vpon Earth: I rule them bothe by Sea and by land, Plenty I make and I make also derth. Whow, it is wunderful that is doon by policy, While you liue take heed striue not aginst policy: The best of them all are glad of Policy, Yea in Westminster hall they vse much policy. Vvordlly man. Prudentia nosct omnia, saith the noble man Tully Policy knoweth all things bothe good and il truly. Oh Policy, what ment I from reason &amp; thee to stray? Neuer wil I forsake you nor yours after this day. Oh help me Policy, help me to some money: Whose taste I looue better then the taste of hony. Precipitation. Sith worthy policy you haue intertained: Now none of his instruments must be disdained. Vvorldly man. Disdained? no faith let him teache me what he wil: And I wil doo it, if it were mine owne father to kil. Couetouse. Say you so? by the masse giue me your hand: Come go with me, let vs no longer idle stand. go out al .iii, togither and make you redy straight waies. Enter Heauenly man. Oh how hard a thing and difficult it is, For them that in their riches doo trust: To enter into the kingdome of Heauen or blis, The words of our Sauiour to be true graunt we must, it is as easy for a Cammel through an Nedles eye to thrust? As for him that on riches hath fixed his minde: The way to eternall saluation to finde. Example heerof you see with your eyes, Of the worldly man giuen to vain pleasure: He promised you heard, from sin to arise, And said he would not looue neither money nor treasure. But as he ought to looue it, that is in a due measure. But beholde how quickly his promise he hath broke: Wherby he kindleth Gods wrath against him to smoke. For now hath he entertained to him Temeritie Precipitation and heady Inconsideration: These cause him to woork all things hedely, And couet to be had in reputation. Then couetouse disguiseth him self on such a fashion. That as Seneca saith, he dooth good to no man: But hurt, &amp; moste to him self as time shall prooue whan. Exit Tenant. Enter an olde man Tenant and speak Cotosolde speech Alaz, alaz, to whome should I make my mone? For euer and a day cham quite vndoon. My Londlord is zo couetouse as the deuil of hel: Except chil giue him such a shameful rent. As cham not able, away ich must incontinent. Chaue dwelt there this zix and therty yeer: Yea these vorty, ich may tel you wel neer. And ich neuer paid abooue yeerly viue pound: And by our Lady, that to be inough chaue vound. Wel, now I must giue him euen as much more: Or els ich must void the next quarter or bevore. Oh masters, is not this euen a lamentable dhing? To zee how Londlords their poor tenants doo wring. And they are not zo couetouse to ask nother, ich beleeue: But a zorte of vooles are as ready to giue. And espetially Straungers, ye a shameful zorte: Are placed now in England and that in euery Porte. That we, our wiues and Children, no houses can get: Wherin we may liue, such price on them is zet. Chad thought a while a go my Londlord would not haue doon thus For he said he would be a heauenly man I wus. But zoule, the Deuil is as Heauenly as he: Three times wurse then he was bevore as var as I can zee. Enter poorly Seruant. Body of me, this would make a man to swere: A shame take them mary, that euer they came there. Nay by gisse I thought he would not be heauenly long: For that to his nature were clene contrary and wrong. Yonder are such a sorte of Ruterkins liuely and ioly: That all that can be gotten is little inough for their belly. Soule we woork, we labour, and that night and day: Yet can we scant haue meat and drink the trueth to say. And that which we haue, is il inough for Dogges: And we are serued with all, like a many of Hogges. Tenant. What seruant? I pray thee what newes with thee? Seruant. By my trueth Father Tenant euen as you see. Kept like no mans seruant, but rather like a slaue: That I am wery of my life I tel you so God me saue. My maister taketh on like the Deuil of hel: There was neuer one so hasty, cruel and fel. But so couetouse Lord, Lord you wil not beleeue: I think all his minde and study to bribery he dooth giue. Enter Hireling. Now a pestlence take him, vile cankard Churle: He is neither good to man, women, boy nor girl. Is this the heauenly man? a shame take him els: Body of me, in all wickednes he now excelles. And if a thing come in his hed be it good or il: Without all wit or reason, doo it he wil. But so couetouse, Lord I think if he might chuse: The dropping of his nose he would not loose. Euery week truely, nay then euery day: He must haue acco?t how many Egges his hens lay Why? there was neuer seen such a miser as he: That the plague cut the throte of him for me. I haue wrought for him this half yeer by the week: And now my work is doon: my money is to seek. If I and all mine should starue for money: Of him I dare say I should not get one peny. A shame take him, how wel the Scripture of him is waid: Which saith sleep not til the Hireling thou hast paid. Tenant. I see wel that I complain not of him alone: But others as wel as I, haue good cause to mone. Wel Seruant, weeping wil not help this geer: But God wil plague him for it, I doo not fear. Seruant I tolde you Hireling how you should be serued: Hireling. What Seruant, thou lookest as though thou were starued. Tenant. He looketh as lustely, freshly and as wel: As all the Seruants that with his maister doo dwel. Hireling. His maister? why? he is no better then a theef: For so that he may haue it, he cares not who suffer greef. Tenant. Nay by the masse that woords is but to true: So that his riches encreaseth he careth not who rue. Seruant. I knowe the occasion of all this geer: But I would not for twenty pound it should come to his eare He saith, that he wil neuer leaue his extorsion: Til of riches he haue gotten an innumerable portion. He wil builde, plant, set, and sowe: Til such a fame of him abrode there growe. That there is none like to him in all the Countrey: And so by that meanes he shall come to authoritie. Hireling. But lightly those that come to authoritie after that rate: Doo end their liues in some miserable and vnhappy state. Tenant thou foole (saith Christ) this night wil I fetch thy soule fr? thee: And then who shall haue the things that thine be? Wel, let him alone, I hope all wil prooue for the best: Euen as he leadeth his life so shall he finde rest. Seruant. Peace, peace for Gods sake, look where the Steward comes: Body of me Sirs, which way shall I run? run out Enter Couetouse. God speed you, what mean you? would you speak with me? Tenant. Yea Sir, euen to desire your worship my vreend vor to to be. Ich haue a zertain petition to your maship to mooue: And ich desire you to be my vreend in it vor Gods looue. Couetouse. What is the matter? let me knowe it at once: I haue somwhat els to doo then hear to tread the stones. Tenant. By my trueth Sir I beseech you vor me to speak a good woord: To your good maister and my Londlord: Ich haue dwelt in his house this vorty yeeres almoste, And ther vpon chaue bestowed much money and cost. And now ich hear zay ich must double my rent: Or els void out of it and that incontinent. I beseech you vor Gods sake on me take some pitty and bone: If I be put out for euer I cham vndoon. Oh good Sir, I knowe that you may doo much: Couetouse. By my trueth I can doo nothing heer in: And so God help me I esteeme no such matters worth a pin. Ber Lady Sir you haue had it a fair season: And yt a man should make what he can of his owne it is reas? I warrant you, ther be inow that that rent wil giue: Tenant. But they shall neuer thriue on it then I beleeue. Ich knowe what he may doo with the house and ground: He may chaunce to vinde rent inough of viue pound. Couetouse. Wel, care not you for that, if you he a wise man: You were best to get one better chepe where you can For I knowe that so much for it, haue he may: Yea, if it stood empty euen this present day. Tenant. Wel Sir, yet me thinks there should be a conscience I think God hateth such couetouse, sir by your patience. Couetouse. Thou art a foolish felowe, heer of to me to complain: For I medle with no such matters I tel you plain. Hireling. make much curtsey Good gentlem?, God saue your life I pray to our lord: May I be so bolde to speak with you (gentleman) one word? Couetouse. Whether the Deuil wilt thou? into mouth me think. Fo Gods ames, how he smelles all of drink. Hireling. Nay by my trueth Sir, I drink none other drink to day: But a little fleet milk mingled with whay. For so God help me if for drink or meat I should dye: I haue not one farthing, any ther with to bye. And by my trueth Sir, this is my sute at this time: I serued your maister in making Brick and lime. Halfe a yeer togither not missing one day: And by my trueth all my wages is yet for to pay. And if it please you heerin to showe me some pleasure: The same to my power with like I wil measure. Couetouse. Body of me, what a beggerly knaue is heear? Why, canst thou not forbere thy money one yeer? Hireling. No by my trueth Sir, for I haue no lands: Nor nothing to liue vpon, but onely my hands. I beseech you be good to me. Couetouse. Why? I meddle not with such things yu doost knowe Hireling. Yes Sir, you are maister Steward I trowe. Couetouse. No faith I am but maister receiuer: I take in all, but by gisse I am no payer. Hireling. Your maister hath a great sort of receiuers in deed: But not one to pay the Hireling his true meed. All braue Vvorldly man. What worthy policy? what make you heer to day? Couetouse. About your affaires I haue busines this way. And beholde Sir as I traueled the Street: With these two fellowes I chaunced for to meet. Who tolde me that they had an ernest sute to you One for his house that he dwelleth in now. Wherin (he saith) you go about to doo him much wrong: For he saith that he hath dwelt in it very long. The other said, you owe him a peece of money: he wrought with you half a yeer &amp; had neuer a peny And thus they took on with me before you did come: And now haue I showed you the whole circumstance &amp; some. Vvorldly man. Mary hang them Uillains haue I nought to doo: But to stand and reason matters with them two? Hear you ten?t, in few woord? you knowe my minde According as I haue tolde you, so you shall me finde. Other prouide money your lease to renue: Or els you shall out incontinent this ts true. Tenant. Oh Londlord me thinks this is to much extremitie: Alas vpon mine age take you some pittye. Cham olde &amp; haue many Children and much charge: I trust londlord ich shall vinde you better at large. Vvorldly man. I cannot tel what I should doo more beleeue me: Many Landlords would not doo as I doo by thee. For I am c?tent for money yu shouldst haue it before an other: I can doo no more for thee if thou wert my brother. Couetouse. Thou must be answerd father, there is no remedy: By Saint Anne me think he speaketh very resonably. Tenant. This resonable speaking c?meth fr? an vnreasonable minde: Wo be to him that to such inconueniences shall a man binde. Hireling. If it please you Sir, help me to my money if you may: Vvorldly man. No by my faith Sir, you get it not to day. You thall tary my leisure, I wil pay you when I see cause: Hireling You are happy Sir, in your hands you haue the lawes. But by gisse if I had any thing that would doo you pleasure: You should haue it when you would and not tary my leasure. Wel I beleeue verely that the prayers of the poor &amp; his cry: Shall ascend into the eares of the Lord God on hye. And he wil plague all those that righteousnes withstand: And as the Prophet saith, root their posteritie out of ye land. Tenant. Wel Hireling, let vs departe this place: It preuaileth not vs of him to craue any grace. Hireling. No more shall it preuail him the Scripture saith in deed: To ask mercy of the Lord when he standeth in need. Exeunt Vvorldly man. Ha, ha, ha, I must laugh, so God me saue: To see what a sort of suters now a dayes we haue. Couetouse. I warrant you if you wil be ruled by Reason and policy: You shall haue all the worlde to sue to you shortly. Vorldly man. A common saying the Fox fareth the better and not ye worse: When that the good wife dooth him ban and cursse. So what care I though to cursse me the people doo not ceasse? As long as by them my riches dooth increace. Oh policy, how glorious my buildings doo shine? No gentlemans in this contrey like vnto mine. Sira what shall I doo? I must make my barnes more great: For I haue not rowme inough to lay in my Rye and whete. Couetouse. Set men a woork with it as soon as ye can: If you lack rowme, make more you may than. Vvorldly man. By gisse I wil, they shall in hand to morrow: I thank you policy I need nothing to borowe. Sirra, the little tenament that by my house dooth stand: I would I could get that to, euen out of hand. I want a little buttrye to lay in my drink: And that would serue the turn handsomly I think. And to say the trueth it is not meet that such a begger as he: Should dwel so neer vnder the nose of me. Couetouse. Who the Deuil put that into your minde? Vvorldly man. Mary euen that did reason my trusty freend. Couetouse, I haue been about it my self all this week: Redy wit all the Lawes for to delay dooth seek. We wil haue it I warrant you by hook or by crook: Tush I warrant you for such od ends dayly we look. Prophet without. O thou Earth, Earth, earth, hear the woord of the Lord: Knowe thy self to be no better then Clay or dust: Let the Vvorldly man looke sudenly about him, Se that thy life to Gods trueth doo alwaies accorde: For from earth thou cammest and to earth thou must. Couetouse. What is the matter? why what aile ye? why look you so about VVorldly man. I heard a terible noise, surely without dout. Which pronounced the woords of the Prophet Ieremy: Saying Earth, Earth, turn thee speedyly. Couetouse. Why, and are you afraid, and amased at that? I see wel you haue a hart like a Gnat. Prophet. That Seruant that diligently dooth fulfil, And watcheth at all times for the c?ming of his maister: And dooth in the mean season apply his wil, Of his masters goods, there be no spoile nor waster. That seruant shalbe sure to be a Taster. Of Gods blessings and ioyes euerlasting: Where as is all consolation and nothing wanting. But that seruant that liueth idlely without care, And looketh not diligently vpon his Office: His maister, shall come sudenly or he be aware, And shall minister to him according to iustice. The portion of Ipocrites shalbe his. Into vtter darknes cast him out wil he: Where as weeping and gnashing of teeth shalbe. Exit. Couetouse. Oh Sira, mary Gods blessing on his hart: Ful honestly he teacheth you Sir, their parte. Vvorldly man. These be the woords of the holy Scripture: Declaring the difference between ye iust and vnpure Good Lord I wold know what these woord? doo mene Couetouse Your Chaplain can tel you, for he is very wel seen. Vvorldly man. I pray you policy, call him to me hether: But look that you come again bothe togither. Couetouse. Yes that we wil I warrant, you need not to feare: We wil be heer again or a Horse can lick his eare. Vvorldly man. By my trueth me thinks I begin to wax sick: In sending away my counceller, I was somwhat to quick. Wel, I wil sit me down and say to sleep heer: Til they into this place again doo appeer. Oh my hed. Enter Gods plague and stand behinde him a while before he speak. It is euen I that vpon thee dooth blowe, Filling thee with plagues and sundry disease: What I am, indeed I wil learne thee to knowe, For I am not afraid thee to displease. Thou shalt departe from thy house and land, Thy wife and Children beggers thou shalt leaue: Thy life thou shalt loose euen out of hand, And after death thy iust rewarde receiue. Thy il gotten goods shall not thee deliuer. Thyne costly buildings shall nothing preuail, Thy odours, thy sweet smelles and thou shalt perish togither, Thy rings, thy bracelets, and Golde chaines shall fall. Straungers and those whome thou didst neuer knowe, Shall possesse that, whiche by frawd thou hast got: Thy seed from of thy ground God wil ouerthrowe, Because at his Prophets preaching thou amenddest not. Thou sleepest in death as the Prophet Dauid dooth say, Out of which sleep when thou shalt awake: Thou shalt perceiue thou must needs away, And that on thee God wil no mercy take. I am the plague of God properly called, Which commeth on the wicked sudainly: I go through all townes and Cittyes strongly walled, Striking to death and that without all mercy. Heer thou wicked couetouse person I doo strike, Which once on the plowe hadst taken holde: But willingly again thou rannest in the Dike: Therfore thy plague shalbe doubled seuen folde. Go out and stand at the door Couetouse. Come Sir Nicolas, come sir Nicolas, come Sir Nicolas come Ignorance. Cham faint, by gisse, would ich had a little more bum. Couetouse. A pestilence take thee, haste thou not inough yet? Ignorance. No, I can drink a Galon and eat neuer a bit. Couetouse. Come in ye knaues name you must expo?d a matter Ignorance. I can expound good ale from fair water. Couetouse. Tush felow thou must expound a peece of Scripture Ignorance. I can doo it as wel as any Bishop I am sure. I haue spouted with the Geneuians xx. on a rowe: Couetouse. And thou wert to good for them all I trowe. Ignorance Was I? yea faith that I was you shall vnder stand With a peece of Lattin I set them all one dry land. Couetouse. And I pray thee hartely what was it? let me hear: Ignorance. Thou shalt if yu wilt promise to giue me a pot of beer Magistrorum clericium inkepe miorum Totus perus altus yongus et oldus Multus knauoribus et quoque fasorum Pickpursus omnius argentus shauus &amp; polus. Let me see what they are all able to say to this. Couetouse. For out of dout a worthy peece of learning it is. Ignorance, A man may as much edyfying out of my lattin take: As ye may out of exposici?s yt many ministers make Couetouse. Euen as thou saist, in faith much of a kinde: For they place the scriptures as fethers in ye winde. Peace body of me, our maister is a sleep: Ignorance. Mary it was time indeed for vs silence to keep. Vvorldly man. Oh I would if I could, but now it is to late: Hold thy peace I pray thee and doo me no more rate. Couetouse.

I holde a Crown he is not very wel: Ignorance. So me thinks for he dreameth of going to Hel. Couetouse. We wil wake him out of that troublesome sleep: Ignorance. Good Lord seest thou not? beholde how he dooth weep Couetouse. How doo you good maister? is he a sleep or a wake? Vvorldly man. Oh good Lord, how my hart dooth ake. Oh sick, sick, neuer so sick in my life berfore: Good Lord, policy I think I shall neuer go h?e more. Ignorance. Mary God forbid, why where is your greef? Vvorldly man. All the partes of my body wanteth releef. Oh Deuotion, I haue such paines in my head: That truely, truely, I wish my self euen dead. Couetouse. Me thought you dremed, for to you self you did talk Vvorldly man. In deed Sir, I dreamed I had a great iourney to walke. Oh what great paines and torments I thought my self in: Lying in fire which to burn did neuer lin. And me thought before me the plague of God did stand: Redy to strike me with a Sworde in his hand. And euer I asked him what was the cause: He answerd that I was a transgressor of Gods Lawes. But Lord how sick I am, and how terible is my pain: No place in my body, but sicknes therin dooth reign. I like not these foolish dreames, policy my freend: Couetouse. Tush a straw, vpon them neuer set your minde. He that to dreames giueth any confidence or trust: Without dout very vnquietly liue he must. Vvorldly man. Oh sick, sick, sick, oh my hed, oh my back: Couetouse.

Dead? body of me, doo you rocken to dye this yeer? Holde your peace I warrant you, ye need not to feare. Lo, see you not how the worldly man showeth his kinde? As sick as he is, on his goods is all his minde. Vvorldly man. Oh policy if I might not dye, what a felow wold I be In all this contrey should be none like vnto me. Sira, what a goodly Turret haue I made in my hall? But yet my banquiting house pleaseth me best of all. Oh, oh, alas what a pang is this at my hart? Couetouse.

Good felow? good man whoball, I wil make you chaunge your note Before that for your labour you get the value of a grote. Phisicion. What howe worldly man, in Gods name I say: Look vp for the looue of God, doo not like a beast decay. Vvorldly man. Who is there? what art thou that callest me? Couetouse. Mary Sir, maister Flebishiten, Phisicion is come &amp; it was he Vvorldly man. Oh sirs, sirs, I fear me all this labour is in vain: You might haue let me go, I was wel out of my pain. Oh maister Phisicion, how think you? what say you to me? Phisicion. By my trueth there is no remedy but one, that I can see. You must put your wil to Gods wil I can say no more: Couetouse. Why? foolish Phisicion he knew that wel inough before. Vvorldly man. What saist thou? is there no remedy but I must dye? Phisicion. No Sir by my trueth, as far as I can see or espye. God may doo much, for he is omnipotent: But you are past help in this world in mans iudgement. Couetouse. What the deuil doost thou heer? then get thee away: Vvorldly man. Departe Phisicion, and thou haste no more to say. Phisition. I trust then, Sir you wil content me for my paines taking: Couetouse You shall haue a new lofe, at the maids next baking. Vorldly man.

Good Lord haue mercy on thee, belike it is to late to amend: In wickednes thou hast liued, euen so thou wilt end. Gentleman, I trust you wil not see me loose my labour: Couetouse. Gentleman go as you came, you are not so much in my fauour Phisicion. A common saying in deed, that is like vnto like: A wicked M. for wicked seruants, God must needs strike. Exit Vvorldly man. Oh Sirs, is there no remedy? what shall I say? Is it not best I set all things at a stay? Couetouse, Yes make sure woork of that while as you be heer: Ignorance. It is time in deed, for death in you dooth appeer. Vvorldly man. Once you knowe that I am greatly in det: And now euery one wil striue, their owne for to get. Bid my wife therfore get a letter of administration, as soon as she may And then as she listeth, my Creditors she may pay. In deed I haue inough to pay euery man his: But by Lady I cannot tel what mine owne shall mis. Commend me to her, and bid her take no thought: But in any wise let her (as neer as she can) forgo nought. Couetouse. By my trueth this is wunderfully wel inuented: As you haue said, I warr?t you it shalbe frequented. Ignorance. Your minde in this thing vndouted is not il: Now as for other things it is best you make a wil. Vvorldly man. It shalbe (Deuotion) euen as thou haste said: Write quickly for of my life I am afraid. Oh must I needs dye? oh must I needs away? Ignorance. Heer is Ink and Paper, what shall I write? Vvorldly man. In the name, first of all doo thou in dite. Ignorance.

Passion of me he is dead, how shall we doo now? Couetouse. Canst thou not tel? no more can I, I make God auow. Sira heer was a trim end that he did make: Thou neuer heardst him the name of God in his mouth take. Ignorance. Tush, God: a strawe, his minde was other waies occupyed: All his study was who should haue his goods when he dyed. Indeed all men may perceiue his minde to be corrupt and il: For God would not suffer him to name him in his wil. A straunge matter, when men haue giuen ouer God: They may be sure to be scurged with his sharp rod. Couetouse. This is the end alwaies wher I begin: For I am the root of all wickednes and sin. I neuer rest to teach and instruct men to euil: Til I bring them bothe body and soule to the Deuil. As we haue doon this worldly man heer as you see: Come therfore Ignorance, wait thou vpon me. The Deuil and I, thou shalt see wil not leaue: Til we haue made the greatest parte to vs to cleue. Come, let vs go hence, heer is no more to be said: Farewel my masters our partes we haue playd. Enter heer Sathan. Oh, oh, oh, oh, all is mine, all his mine, My kingdome increaseth euery houre and day: Oh, how they seek my magestie deuine, To come to me they labour all that they may. The worldly man (quoth he) nay the diuilish man than, For more wickednes and mischeef then he did vse: I my self indeed neuer deuise can, Oh at his ioly wisdome I must needs muse. How cunningly put he his mony to vsury? Yea, and that without offence of any law: He was not to learne any kinde of bribery, Wherby wicked gaines to him he might draw. An abhominable drunkard, a stinking Lecherer, A filthy Sodomit, a corrupt canscience within: A priuy slanderer, and a suttle murtherer, To be short, a very dunghil and sink of sin. Oh my boy Couetouse, I may thank thee of all this Thou nouledst him in all mischeef and vice: Therfore shalt thou be sure to haue my blisse: For abooue all other thou indeed art moste wise. Thou teachest the worldly man, a leacemonger to be, To oppresse the poore and of his riches him to defraud: Wickedly to vse the lawes he learned of thee, Therfore indeed thou art worthy of much lawd. All you worldly men, that in your riches doo trust, Be mery and iocond, builde Palaces and make lusty cheer: Put your money to Usury, let it not lye and rust, Occupye your selues in my lawes while ye be heer. Spare not, nor care not, what mischeef you frequent, Use drunkennes, deceit, take other mens wiues: Passe of nothing; one houre is inough to repent, Of all the wickednes you haue doon in your liues. Oh, if you wil thus after my Lawes behaue, You shall haue all things as this worldly man had: Be bolde of me, what you wil to craue, And dout you not but with you I wil play the loouing lad. Yea, and after death I wil prouide a place, For you in my kingdome for euer to reign: You shall fare no wurse then dooth mine owne grace, That is to lye burning for euer in pain. Come on mine owne Boy, go thou with me, Thou hast serued me duely, and hatest me neuer: Therfore now for thy paines rewarded shalt thou be: In euer lasting fire that burneth for euer. Bear him out vpon his back. Contentation. He that toucheth pitch, shalbe defiled with the same, And he that keepeth company with those that be vicious: Shall at the length growe like vnto the same, Working things wicked and pernicious, Euen so it is also to be associate with the righteous. For he that haunteth and keepeth honest company: Cannot chuse but liue according to the same actually. Example, the Iewes beeing conuersant with the Heathen, Drank of their superstition and idolatry: And by that meanes fel from the true God of Heauen, To worshipping of Blocks which was meer blasphemy. Likewise it is at this day verily, Christen men are seduced by keeping of il company: And brought from the very trueth to hypocricy. And who are those that are thus deceiued? Euen such as are not content when to are wel: They be not thankful for that they haue receiued, But euer they think stil more and more to excel, Contentation from their mindes they doo expel. And vnder the pretence of reason, wit and policy: They couet to run to mischeef and sin hedely. Heuenly man. Like as Golde and siluer is tried in the fire, So faithful men in the fornace of aduersitie be prooued: The heauenly must not liue as flesh and lust dooth desire, But heauenly things of heauenly men be looued. With no kinde of temptation he must be mooued. Be it sicknes or pouertie, or what so euer of God is sent: The heauenly must take it patiently and be therwith c?tent Inough, Inough is as good as a feast, where contentation dooth dwel, For where he remaineth is the spirit of God with rest: The vnquiet minde of the couetouse dooth grutch and swel, And to liue with Inough he dooth abhorre and detest. The greedy gasping of Couetouse dooth him so molest. That to be rich be all his whole minde dooth set: Nothing regarding how the same he dooth get. Contentation. Pithagoras saith, that a man of Couetouse desire, Cannot be contented nether with abundance: For the more he hath, the more stil he dooth require, Wherfore such persons prouoke God to vengeance, Example of the worldly man, late of remembrance, Whose wicked life offended the Lord so excedingly. That his heauy plagues came vpon him sudenly. Heauenly man. God graunt his ende, example may be, To all men how their riches they shall vse: Make not that thy God, which should be seruant vnto thee, For in so dooing thou doost it greatly abuse. I pray God (I say) that our couetouse we may refuse, And one of vs to looue an other, for that pleaseth God best: So shall we be sure to inheret the good land of rest. Rest. By Gods great goodnes I am sent vnto thee, Rest is my name wherin the heauenly shal abide: Happy are those persons that come vnto me, For I beeing present all troubles I doo deuide. With ioyes I am adorned, yea on euery side, Which are prepared for the heauenly from the beginning: And giuen vnto them for a rewarde of their godly liuing. Heauenly man. Thanks be giuen to thee O Father omnipotent, Thy mercyes Lord, and not my deserts truely: Hath caused those ioyes to me to be sent, Graunt me grace therfore to praise thy name duely. Thy goodnes appeereth to me euery day newly. Whilest breath and life prolong my dayes: My mouth shall not ceasse thy holy name to praise: Inough. Inough is as good as a feast, heer let vs stay, We haue troubled our audience, that let vs remember: Let vs conclude therfore, but first let vs pray, That it wil please God in mercy our good mistres to tender, Our faith to stablish wherin we be slender. That at the last day when the trump shall blowe: For to be heauenly men the Lord may vs al knowe Contentation. First let vs call to God for Iesu Christes sake, Long to preserue Elizabeth our moste noble Queen Good Lord graunt her highnes the heauenly path to take, And that all bye waies, of her highnes may be seen. Encrease her welth, prolong her helth, preserue her life: That long she may rule this realme, wtout debate or strife. Finis.</field>
