Chal: Come Vallen. lets to Sir God-fries house, I know there will be reueling to night This is his birth day: and he welcoms all, Fair Anabell his daughter is my loue, There shalt thou see the Idoll of my thought, Faire Bristows miror and my harts delight. Val. Frend Challener, I wonder at thy humor, To dote so much ouer this female kind, That charms thy sences makes thy eie sight blind. Chal. Thou art an enemy to women still, I prethee what doth best agree with thee. Val. To see my hounds, to chase the fallow deere, to see my fachon strike the partridge dead. to heare my horse Careere, to drink full healths, and not liue puling for an nounce of Beauty, Chal. I loue to see my hounds as well as thee, My horse, my fachon, and healthes when time serues, But aboue all my mistris I prefer, She is the Fewelt that doth heate my bloud, And therefore Vallenger, for my sake goe and see, the gallants will be here to night, Val. Yfaith you bind me to a mighty task Ile see your Lady, and your Ladies maske, then prethee peace here will we keepe our stand. Chal. For by the Drum the Maskers are at hand. Enter Sir Godfrey, Vmphrevil, his wife, his daughter, and the Maskers to daunce. God. Now gentlemen, your welcome to my house, Good maister Challener and your honest frend, So are you all yong gallants euery one, But we forget our selues, boddy of me, Where be these Ladds, what shall we haue No dauncing after dinner? Ho, vp with the tables, If they haue dined within, and come Yong Ladds now to your dance againe. Here they dance and Vallenger speaks. Val. False tong that spoke such blasphemy before, That I dispraised, now doth my soule adore. Chal. How dost thou like my loue now Vallenger. Val. O shees deuine and I become her thrall. Chal. Doth Bristow yeeld her fellow, prethee speake, Val. A thousand, I must hence or else my hart will break. Exit. Chal. What meanes my frend in such a humor goe, Ile know the cause before I leaue him so, Exit Challener, and Vallenger. Here the dannce ends. God. Gentlemen I thank you all, Lets in to supper tho the cheare be small, (Exit the Maskers. Enter vallenger and Challener. Chal. Uallinger thou art a traitor to thy frend. val. Not to my frend but alwaies to my foe. Chal. Why dost thou loue the saint I do adore. val. To anger thee I sweare to loue her more. Chal. I loued her first, when thou didst loue disdaine. val. I loue her now, therefore thy loue is vaine. Chal. Forsweare to name her else thou art my foe. val. Forsweare my Anabell, hence dotard go, Chal. Prepare thee Uallener it is decreed. For Anabell, or thou or I must bleed? val. On Sir tis welcome spare not but thrust home. Here they fight, vallenger falls downe. And Challener flies away, vallenger cals For helpe, Sir Godfrey, his wife, and his Daughters, comes forth with lights. val. Some Gracious Body helpe me I am slaine. God. Whose that which cals for help, gods pitty wife, The Gentleman, lies bleeding heere that came with maister Challen. I pray Sir speake who hath hurt ye thus. val. The villen Chalener hath almost slaine me. God. Challener, why I thought you had bin friends. What was the matter Sir may I know it? val. About your daughter, and while she was dancing I praysed her gesture and her comely grace, But Uallenger most like a liberall villaine, Did giue her scandelus Ignoble termes, Which I rebuked him for whereupon, We drew our weapons, I by chaunce being downe, The coward villaine thus hath wounded me. God. How say you wife, did not I say so much, He was a Cutter and a swaggerer, He haue my child, no, no, he aymes amisse, Go presently make search thrughout the Citty, Where ere you find him carrie him straight to prison, Looke to him, come Sir, since your hurt Was about my girle, you shall not from my house till you are thorow whole. val. I thank you sir, I am much bound to you. God. Come sir, my wife and my daughter shalbe your surgeon, come helpe him in: softly knaues I say, Exit Omnes. Enter Harbert, sentloe, and Florence a Courtizan. Har. I prethee Sentloe leaue this Idell life, That will vndoo thee if thou followes it, Art thou so fond ouer so light a thing, Dost thou expect her lust before my loue Dost thou not see thy sin nor yet thy shame, Thy reputation, honor, nor thy name. Sent. I prethee harbart peace content thy selfe, she whom I loue, thou seest loues me againe, thinks thou that I so long haue seen the worlde, and do not know my frend now from my foe. Har. She whow thou thinkst wil proue thy greatest frend, Will proue a serpent and a cockatryce: For what is she but a common stall, that loues thee for thy coine, not for thy name, Such loue is beastly, rotten, blind, and lame. Sent. Forbeare me this, and chid me for ought else, Har. Leaue this, and vndertake what liks thee best, Leaue her, and then my thoughts will be at rest, Flo. And why sir leaue me, for your companie, I would thy loue were equall vnto mine, then Sentlo should be sure he had a frend. Har. As thine, Ide rather hang my selfe, Sentloe leaue England for a little space, Goe to braue Richard in the holie Land, the warres will teach thee to forget thy loue. Flo. Will sentlo leaue hir that doth loue him so, for thy sake will I go in russet, Ly in a cottage, eat what so thou please, Rather then I will want thy companie, I will be come as mild and duetyfull. as euer Grissell was vnto hir lord, and for my constancie, as Lucrce was, and if that Sentlo will but liue with me. Sent. I know it sweet, when I from thee depart, Then let my Luke warme bloud, forsake my hart, Harbert you wrong me to abuse her thus. Har. Thou wrongst thy selfe, me, and all thy frends, But if thou wilt not leaue her company I vow my frendship to thee is cold. Ile leaue thee to the humors of thy youth, To one that hath nor honestie nor truth. Sent. What dost thou threaten me, go wher you please, Harbart your companie contents not me, Leaue me, ile leaue thee first, and so farwell: come loue lets hence. To Bristow will we go, Who cares where Harbart be or frend or foe. Har. O how vnbrideled is the course of youth, That takes his frend to be his greatest foe, and thinks the counsell that should do him good: Like poison, or as the herbe Draconis, Well tho thou scorne thy frend that holds thee deare, he will not leaue thee in extreamity, Thou art gone to Bristow, thether will I go, Where I will proue a frend and not a foe. Exit. Enter Sir godfrey, vallinger, his wife, and his daughter. god. Sir I am glad you are so well recouered, And for the motion which you made to me, Touching my child, I promise you truly Sir, I do not know the man in Bristo, That I affect more then I do yourselfe, Chal Sir I haue found it, and I wish I may Make satisfaction for your good regard, And louing care that you haue had of me, So please you Sir to know your daughters mind, Which way her maiden thoughts are most inclind, Enter a messenger with a letter.

Ana. Faith whosoeuer you shall thinke meet. God. Why thats wel sed my wench, ther spok an angel Looke yonder what saist thou to yong Vallenger, He is a man as twere compleat of waxe, His father is an honorable knight, A Challener, a very stock to this, Loue him my girle, say as I say, do. Ana I neuer heard a father labour more, To win his daughter that was woon before. Wom. Daughter what say you to your father. God. Why wife I know what she would say already, She hath loued Challener. And would thinke, Her fond in leauing him so soone to chuse another, And thinks we would be angry, If she loued Uallenger, tut vse thy mind Ana. Father, I know these words are all but iests, Dispose euen as it likes you best. God. Well sed my girle then Uallenger is he, What say you Ellen do you not agree. Wom.

By heauen if all my wealth were in the sea, And I left Desprate, suckerles, and bare, It would not halfe so much haue gauld my hart, As this same newes, this fatall deadlines. Ia.

I do imbrace the law, as pleased to die, Father forgiue the follies of my youth, Umphrevill, let me beare to heauen Upon the wings of my vnfained repentance, My sorrow heere indented in my tears, And thou indued wonder of thy sexe, Forgiue the wrongs that I haue done to thee, That I may go with peace vnto my death. king. Away with them, To morrow see execution be performd, Ana. O mercy Richard, show some mercy, Will Uallenger in silence losse his son, And harder then the Penerian rockes, Neuer be perst, Although the Father will not, Richmond plead: And if that Richmond dare not, Liestor speak, O see the time fleets hence with Swolloes wings, Time runs: O Gratious king be mercifull. king. Lady I cannot breake the limites of the law, A wilfull murder must be paid with death, Yet bring me a man that willingly will yeeld Sufferance of death, to saue yong Uallenger, And he shall liue, else hope no further grace: Atend our further pleasurs at the court. ana. This is some comfort, happie Anabell, Now show thy ready and thy womans wit. Chal. How shall he liue in one will die for him, Well Uallenger, it thou haue such a friend: Thou art happie, but I mean to see the end. Exit Challener. Enter Sentloe like a frier. Sent. Thus like a frier I haue disguised my selfe, To see my deere friend, that hath saued my life, And that same strumpet that Would haue caused my death. A harlots loue, is like a chimney smoke, Quiuering in the aire betweene two blasts of winde, Borne heere and there by either of the same, And properly to none of both inclind, Hate, and dispaire, is painted in their eies, Deceit, and treason, in their bossome lies: Their promises, are made of brittle glasse, Ground like a phillip, to the finest dust, Their thoughts like streaming riuers swiftly passe, Their words are oyle, and yet they geather rust, True are they neuer found, but in vntruth: Constant in nought, but in vnconstancie: Deuouring cankars of mans liberty, But stay: I am at the prison gate, Where are you keeper, let me speake with you? keep. Who knocks there? Sent. A fryer come to confesse your prisoners. Keep. Stay ile bring them to you presently. Enter Vallenger, Florence, and Blunt, and the keeper. Sent. Health to this place: sir, let me speake with you. Do you not sorrow inward at your hart, For your loose life you haue so wanton spent. Val. Yes: from my hart Sir, and do thinke it long, That this vild life of mine doth breath so long. Sent. Do not dispaire, although your death be nie, Heauen looke vpon you with a Gracious eie. flo. Now gentlewoman: let me speake with you, Now good fellow, what wouldst thou haue with me? Sent. To confes truly your offences past. flo. Well: shall I confes one thing truly to thee, Sent. One thing, and euery thing. flo. Why then I confes truely that before This time neuer confest any thing truely, But in briefe father ile tell thee, All that I couseaned, I defrauded: Those I haue slandered, I haue defamed, Whom I hated, I loued not: And this hath bin the manner of my life. Sent. Are you not sorry for that you haue done. flo. No by my troth, nere a whit at all. Sent. I hope your mind will chang before you die. flo. Perhaps you know so much: trust me, not I. Sent. God turn your hart: frend let me speak with you, The time draws neere of execution, What is it meete I goe along with you? Har. I gentle Sentloe, and thy selfe shall see, The deference twixt lust, and chastity Enter a messenger. Mes. You must bring the prisoners away, the king and peeres are already set. keep. Say we make all the speed we may. flo. Come noble harts, lets fearles march away, A little hanging will dispatch vs all. Exit Omnes, Enter the king, Richmond, Liester Sir Eustice, Sir Godfrey, to the execution. king. Sir Godfrey, and Sir Eustice vallenger, Your Siluer haires shoulde teach you patience. god. My ledge, God be my record I do not repine, Alack good knight, thou weeps in vaine, But now there is no helpe. Eust. I, I, my Soueraine iustice on my son, He hath deserued death, and let him haue it. king. Sir godfrey, hath your daughter yet Found out a man will die for Uallenger, Such was our promise in regard of her, And since our word is past, we graunt it him. god. No, no, my Soueraine, I haue hard, A man vrged by nessesity to lead his frend, Or to redeeme his person with his owne, But to find one will die for a frend, This age we liue in doth not now aford. Enter the officers with the prisoners. king. Dispose yong Uallenger the first to death, That done, send hence the other to their sentence domd va. Ere I asend this stage where I must act, The latest period of this life of mine, First let me do my deuty to my prince. Next vnto you, to much by me offended, Now step, by step, as I assend this place, Mount thou my soule into the throwne of grace, If my offence might be forgiuen on earth, I would aske pardon of my dread king. My parents, and my wife, That must forgiue me, But my hatefull life Hath so be bloted and besmered my fault, That when I come to ask the last forgiuenes, They will not list my sute, Nor yet regard it. Enter at one doore, Anabell disguised like a man, and at another Challener. Ana. Stay: heere is one will die for vallenger. Chal. Nay heere is one will die for Vallenger. God. Be blind mine eies, O vertuous Challener. Come to redeeme his enemy from death. val. O Challener, by the deep wrongs that I haue done to thee, O hide thy face, thy lookes are far more keene, Then is the axe, must strike the fatall stroke: For thee sweet youth, thou canst aledge no reason Why thou shouldst die for me, Be iust O king. No torment worse, then fruitles lingering. King. Dispatch them executioner: dispatch. ana. Stay executioner: do me iustice king, thy word is past that vallenger shall liue, If any one will loose his life for him, And that will I: ile dy for vallenger, Chal. Nay heere is one, that for the loue he beares, to Anabell, but not to him, will die for vallenger. ana. My plea was entred first, my claime must stand. Cha. Tell me but what thou art, rash yongman, that dares enter into this place before me: humannity doth teach thee thou euer shouldst Giue place vnto thine elders, in all asaies, how rude then and vnmannerly art thou, To forget this common courtesie, that parents teach their children euery houre, Ana. Sir, in humanity I must confesse, So much as you aledge but not in death. the graue is as the publick theater, the roome being taken vp, by them first enter, the second sort must sit but as they come. Besids you say you die for anabell, She nere deserued death: therfore giue your plea to him that hath true title for the same. God. Thats not by thee fond girle, Kneele Eustice, kneele, do not acept Against her folly, do not good my ledge. King. Why you amaze me, whats the matter? God. Why my ledge, this is my child, my anabell? Came in this disguyse, to saue his life, that was the spoile of hers, Now aforegod girle thou art much to blame. What is that other? God. My Lord, this is vertuous Challener, Come to redeeme his enemy from death. King. a conflickt of exceeding consequence, and much renownes that worthy gentleman, tho let me tell you we are much displeasd, that anabell should baffel thus our lawes, We asked a man, and she a woman to delude vs. therefore we are content her husband haue his life, But she shall lay her head vpon the block, and she shall haue no executioner, But vallenger him selfe, shall strike it off: this is our sentence, and we will not chang. Ana. pray god thou dost not king, for I accept it. Come Uallenger, that happy hand of thine, Shall saue thy life and make an end of mine. val. To strike the stroke, to murder Anabell, First let my soule sinck to the pit of hell. Cha. A man the executioner of his wife, Is so vnhumaine that a mortall eie Would euen be bloudshed to behold the same, Therefore dread king let me die for both, But to defend so scandelus an act: And as for thee, I hate thee Uallenger, And could be well content withall my hart, To be thy deathes man, for thou hatest me, Besids, yet Ualenger consider this, Hauing a wife so faire as Anabell, Beloued of me thy foe, and so intierly, That I do offer vp my life for hers, Should mercy pardon now what law doth threaten, Thou must immagin if that we too liue, I still should go about to murder thee, To inioy thy wife, whom I so much do loue, therefore beg of the king that onely I may die, to saue her honor, and thy infamie. Blu. Hark you huswife, do you heare all this: Doth not your hart melt at this amis. Flo. Melt Blunt yes, and doth weepe brinish tears, to see what fames them, and doth me confound, Heere is a glasse for such as liues by lust, See what tis to be honest, what tis to be iust, Blu. Why this is wel: now Soueraine hear me speak, If he that is supposed slaine doth liue, Then friendly may we reconsile these iars, king. Our law doeth light on none, but guilty crimes: And that it punisheth as iustice willes. Blu. Why then vouchsafe all in this princely presence, This gentleman and I brought all to passe, He in a Docters shape, hath saued the life Of my frend Sentloe, and of Anabell, I in like sort haue saued Uallenger, And Sentloe which by me should haue bin slaine, I saued him by an honest policie. And now aliue present him to your sight, To make a pleasing end of these sad sightes. Heere Sentloe putteth off his whod and kneeles downe. This breaths new life into my hated hart. Val. Sweet beautious lettes, the rauser of my smart, Forget in me, what I haue done amisse, And seale my pardon with one balmy kisse My soule repents her lewd impyetie. Ana. My blouds deere solace, and my best content, My onely deere esteemed Vallenger, Not all the world being turned into pleasure, Could giue my soule such sweet contented treasure, Thou art more deere, more pleasing to my mind, then at the first: before thou prouest vnkind, tis insident for yong men to offend, And wiues must stay their leasures to amend. Chal. This kind contryssion of yong vallenger, More ioyes my hart, then rest to trauelers, Liue long together, and may neuer fate, this new ioynd league of marriage seperate. Har. The like say I, to thee that now hath tryed, A friends firme faith, that nothing can deuide. Sent. the which I will indeuer to deserue, And not so much as once in thought to swerue. king. Since all things sorteth to this happines, And pining care, is turned to ioyfull mirth, I will be partner in your meryment, Away with that same tradgike monument, For that same Florence there, because we see, she sorrowes somthing for her follies past, Let her be had among the Conuertines. And as her faults shall vanish or else stay, Let her be vsed accordingly. Away with her, Glad parents, and glad frends, In Bristow here a while our selues will stay, And spend some sportfull houres to crowne your ioy After so many troubles, and tyerd annoy. Exit Omnes.
