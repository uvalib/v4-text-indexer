      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATED (WITHOUT PERMISSION) TO MRS. PINTO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Woman of Shunem, Her Husband, Her Son, Female Friend, Elisha, the Prophet, Gehazi, his Attendant, Chorus of Syrians, Chorus of Neighbours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. Husband, Woman of Shunem, Female Friend, and Chorus of Neighbours. RECITATIVE. Jehovah! thou our souls inspire, And warm with thy celestial fire! Our tongues inform, our accents raise, To sing thy goodness and thy praise. CHORUS. Jehovah! thou our souls inspire, &amp;c. AIR. Female Friend. How blest are they whose pious hearts Deserve the good which Heaven imparts; Who, due as dawns each rising day, Their song of grateful tribute pay! Beholding garners swell'd with grain, Which grant the pleasing pow'r, To soothe the weary stranger's pain And gild his ev'ning hour. RECITATIVE. Woman. And when, my husband, hath the needy stranger Uncherish'd past our gate? Husband. O never, never! Why do we more possess than Nature craves, But to relieve affliction? and thy heart, Benevolently soft, is ever prone To sympathize with sorrow, then most happy When dealing bliss to others. AIR. Here Nature strews with lib'ral hand Her blessings o'er a fertile land; And gives a lesson, as she pours Among her sons her copious stores; For man most graceful then appears, Most worthy the fair form he bears, When (proxy of all bounteous Heav'n) He free bestows what free was given. CHORUS. Raise the theme, the chorus raise, In songs of gratitude and praise, To him who strews with lib'ral hand, His blessings o'er a fertile land. RECITATIVE. Where is our holy guest, the man of God? Hath he walk'd forth this morn? Doth the soft vale, And sweetly trilling brook, allure his steps? Or doth he, on the mountain-summit, wake His heav'nly harp, and hymn the Lord of light? Woman. Within his humble chamber, (ah! too humble For so divine a resident) he sits In silent meditation.—But I grieve To hear this day he leaves us. Holy cares, And high important rites on Carmel's brow, Demand his speedy presence Husband. Lo! where comes His servant, good Gehazi! GEHAZI. Advancing. Hail, blest pair! Thus, in my voice, the great Elisha greets you, And thus declares.—For that he oft hath dwelt Beneath your hospitable roof, and shar'd The social meal; he wishes to reward The care and kindness of your friendly hearts. Woman. We are his debtors still; he never graces Our lowly dwelling with his rev'rend form, But heav'nly blessings follow.—Hath he not Giv'n more already than all cares can pay? My child, my blooming boy! his pray'rs obtain'd That precious treasure from indulgent Heav'n. Gehazi. Possessing boundless power with Israel's King And his embattl'd hosts, once more he asks, Shall he commend your virtues to the throne, Or to the leader of the martial train? AIR. Declare, man of Shunem, do martial alarms Inflame thee with thirst of renown? Forth, forth, to the field, be tremendous in arms, Bright honour thy ardor shall crown; Or thou, his lov'd consort, if splendor and state Have kindled their fire in thy breast, Thy dwelling shall be in the paths of the great, And purple and gold be thy vest. RECITATIVE. Husband. Let not thine earnest eye appeal to me, The rectitude of thy unerring heart Needs no advisers aid! my wife, reply. RECITATIVE. Accompanied. Woman. Deal splendid gifts, where deeds of fame Or high descent such honors claim. The gorgeous robe and spacious dome, Our humble rank would ill become. Serener bliss attends us here, Enjoyments suited to our sphere, To us this mild embow'ring grove Is dearer than the proud alcove; Yon' flow'ry lawn more rich we deem Than vestments bright with studded gem. AIR. Among mine own content I dwell— Possessing, in the lowly cell, Friends, whose social smiles I prove, So good, so kind a husband's love, And mother of so sweet a boy, No wish intrudes for other joy; Among mine own content I dwell. RECITATIVE. Gehazi. O nobly answer'd! and the Prophet's heart Will glow with pleasure at the wise resolve. Farewell! his blessing rest on thee and thine! Husband. Our duteous thanks are his.—Say we intreat He will not scant his bounteous visitation To this our homely dwelling, which his age, And sanctity hath grac'd. Gehazi. This moderation, This noble self-denial, makes your virtues Shine out with added lustre, and bestows Delight unknown to grandeur's lofty sons. AIR. Blest whom wisdom's voice inspires To place a bound to their desires! Whom no temptation lures astray, To trace ambition's dang'rous way, But safely sit and cheerful sing Beneath contentment's shelt'ring wing! SEMI-CHORUS. Blest, whom Wisdom's voice, &amp;c. Gehazi having left them, the Son advances. RECITATIVE. Woman. Behold our blooming hope! with eager look, And hasty step he comes! Husband. What would my boy? Son. My dearest father, see how bright the sky, How glorious shines the sun! may I not go, And share the pleasure of this happy day, The last of harvest labour? AIR. Hark, the peasants how they sing, As around the sheaves they throng! While merry birds, with flutt'ring wing, Hover round and join the song. Let me to the fields repair, Let me thro' the meadows roam, See the various hues they wear, And join the jovial harvest-home! Let me, let me, &amp;c. Let me their employ partake, Let me aid the gleaner's toil, The scatter'd ear I'll careful seek, And make the needy stranger smile. Let me, let me, &amp;c. RECITATIVE. Husband. Not now, my boy, repress thine ardent wish; It grieves me to deny thee, but the sun Glows with extremest heat this day—each hour His beams grow more intense. Woman. Nay let him go, Forgive, my dearest husband; wer't not pity To check the pious instinct of his mind, His early love of charity? I trust He will receive no harm. AIR. Oh! let him his creator know In the rich wonders of the fields, Behold the beauties as they blow, Behold the treasure autumn yields! With such ideas be his mind endow'd! Oh! let him soon acquaint himself with God! RECITATIVE. Husband. My wife, dost thou Aid his request? when two such suitors join, Can I again deny? and yet I fear. Woman. I too have fears, but with a mother's fears I have a mother's weakness—O! behold him! FULL CHORUS. Let him to the fields repair, Let him thro' the meadows roam, See the various hues they wear, And join the jovial harvest home. END OF PART I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. The Prophet in his Bower—Gehazi and the Syrians advance. RECITATIVE. Gehazi. With Naaman's gratitude the good Elisha Will be well pleas'd, but rest assur'd ye Syrians, Of perishable treasures, earthly dross, He will not touch; his treasures he lays up Where great Jehovah dwells—But meet it is, Ye do your leader's bidding—Lo! where sits The pious Seer!—What dignity of aspect! Around his rev'rend form the curling vines A beauteous arbour raise; I lead you to him— Yet, pause awhile—with holy rapture fir'd He strikes the strings to his Creator's praise. HYMN. Elisha. O God! what words can suit thy name, What human tongue thy power proclaim? In these thy bounties best ador'd, Let these thy wond'rous praise record! Disclose, ye streams, that feed the earth, The skill profound that gave ye birth! Ye flowers, who court yon' sunny ray, His beauties and his grace display! And thou, bright sun, thou wond'rous seat Of life's great blessings, light and heat, In thy unerring course record The power and splendor of thy Lord! RECITATIVE. Gehazi. Naaman (restor'd in Jordan's cleansing stream) These warlike bands, flower of the Syrian host, Laden with treasure sends to greet thy wisdom, That wrought this mighty blessing; fill'd with wonder To thee they dedicate their future lives, Walk in thy paths, and in thy worship join. Air &amp; Chorus—Gehazi &amp; Syrians. Gehazi. When the shrill trumpet calls to fight, Thy God they will implore To aid them with his heav'nly might, And him alone adore. CHORUS. When the shrill trumpet calls to fight, Thy God we will implore To aid us with his heav'nly might, And him alone adore. Gehazi. And conquest—crown'd in songs of praise make known, That Israel's wond'rous God—is God alone. CHORUS. [Syrians.] And conquest—crown'd in songs of praise make known, That Israel's wondrous God is God alone. RECITATIVE. Elisha. Your leader's proffer'd bounties claim my thanks, Not my acceptance—bear them back in peace. Say thus to Naaman: ‘For thy health restor'd ‘Would'st thou shew gratitude, be it in praise ‘To that invisible, all-knowing power, ‘Who breath'd his counsels in his Prophet's heart.’ AIR. For splendid gems or shining gold, Celestial mercies are not sold. Pious transport, ardent praise, Effusions of the grateful breast, That mortal to immortal raise, Delight the God of goodness best. Friend, Father, Son, Reapers, &amp;c. in the field. RECITATIVE. Friend. Lo! gen'rous Lord of these extensive fields, Nor yet the sun hath spent his fervid rays, And all our task is done. Father. What vast profusion Hath crown'd this harvest! How, beneath his load Bends the tir'd ox! The sun burn'd Sickle-man, Wiping his ruddy brow, eyes with delight The produce of his labour. Pious gratitude, Do thou inspire the song! 'ere homeward move The rural train with their abundant store. AIR. Father. Sons of Israel, grateful bend To him whose bounty knows no end; By whose command the pregnant earth Warms infant atoms into birth; By whose command the scatter'd grain With swelling myriads loads the plain. SEMI-CHORUS. Sons of Israel, &amp;c. RECITATIVE. Friend. Ah me! what ails thy child? with sudden hand He strikes his brow; lo! now his colour fades; His sight forsakes him, and his tott'ring limbs Hardly support his frame. Father. Alas, he faints! O my lost comfort! Death is in his face; Some sudden blast from the sun's heat intense, Or apoplectic stroke hath smote his brain! Raise him, my friends, and to his mother bear This piteous object. O! unhappy woman! What misery thy rash request hath drawn On thine own heart, and thy too easy husband's! AIR. O weak and irresolute fool, To yield to a sigh or a tear, Why suffer indulgence to rule, Why deaf to the warnings of fear? O lovely flower, too soon decay'd, And with'ring in eternal shade. Woman, and Chorus of Neighbours. RECITATIVE. Woman. My dear companions, ye delight my heart; O how melodious to a mother's ear Is the kind tongue that chaunts her darling's praise. AIR. He, my daily thought employs He, endears my humble home, Source of many present joys, Pledge of many yet to come! If within my gloomy mind, Transient cares a passage find He can bid their rancour cease, He can smile, and all is peace. Female Friend advaning. RECITATIVE. Friend. All pleasures are imperfect here below Arm, arm thy heart! lo! where thy son is brought, Supported by thy friends. The dart of malady Hath pierc'd him sore. Woman. Ah me! my child is dead! Husband, Son, and Neighbours. Friend. Impetuous woe, prophetic of the worst, Suspends the flowing blood—she faints, she sinks, By the pale object of her suff'ring heart! Oh! in this awful pause of Nature's powers, Pour we our prayers for respite to her grief, And the mute anguish of yon drooping Sire. Soft and solemn Chorus. May that great God, who to the Prophet's prayer This precious treasure gave, this treasure spare! Beam o'er the child his wond'rous power to save, And snatch his beauties from an early grave! RECITATIVE. Woman. Cease, cease your supplications,—useless all. 'Tis heav'ns decree—behold! O killing sight! AIR. What art, alas! can chase his pain?— To combat Fate all pow'r is vain. Short he draws his rosy breath, Too sure presage of certain death! Clos'd for ever his sweet eyes! Hark!—He pants, he gasps, he dies! RECITATIVE. Husband. Too fatal truth! Jehovah hath recall'd The gift he gave, be patient, and submit. DUET.—Husband and Friend. 'Twere impious now to mourn, Thy child is dead, His spirit fled, Never, never to return. RECITATIVE. Accompanied. Woman. Some wond'rous power awakes my slumbering soul Ne'er to return! Who shall prescribe a bound To God Omnipotent? That pow'rful word, Which made the barren, fruitful, can from death Retrieve the life he gave. Elisha lives! Hence to mount Carmel will I take my flight! His God hath not forsook him, but again May listen to his prayers. Husband. Forbear, forbear! My dearest wife! Woman. I must not be withheld, My anxious mind will never know repose If I not make this last, this great essay. DUET. Husband and Woman. Husband. Whate'er from Heaven could be obtain'd, Already hath Elisha gain'd. Woman. His God hath mercies to dispense Beyond the stretch of human sense. Husband. Shall weak misjudging mortals plead Against the stroke that's giv'n, Strive to reverse the doom decreed, And laws prescribe to heav'n? The Prophet's righteous ire I dread, No holy omen now invites, The season, day and hour forbid; Not this a time of holy rites. Woman. From holy lips when prayer proceeds No season, day or hour forbids; Our gracious God in all alike will hear The sorrower's sighings and the good man's prayer. Husband. Oh truly spoke! When prayer proceeds From holy lips, no hour forbids. Our gracious God, &amp;c. FULL CHORUS. From holy lips, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. Elisha, Women, and Gehazi. RECITATIVE. Gehazi. O grievous conflict! How the Prophet's soul Labours within him! Nay, arise not yet, Still keep that suppliant posture, and renew Your fervent supplications. Not the lack Of pity holds him mute, but pious dread, Lest such a mighty and unwonted boon Be not too much to ask. Again essay In soft'ning strains to fix his wav'ring mind. DUET. Elisha and Woman. Woman. Tho' mighty the request I make, O let thy soft compassion wake And for the mourner plead. Elisha. What words can human thought conceive, What prayer can vital heat retrieve, ‘What cries, awake the dead?’ TRIO.—Woman, Gehazi, Elisha. He at whose words chaotic night Sprung into sudden heat and light, While trembling darkness fled; Who bade unnumber'd worlds arise, Bright lamps of the unmeasur'd skies, He can awake the dead. RECITATIVE. Elisha. Rise, best of women, rise! and oh, withdraw That fixed eye of woe, it smites my soul. Gehazi. Hope be thy comfort! still! the glist'ning drop Of holy pity trembles in its orb. And lo! his staff with look divine he views, As tho' he would infuse some powerful charm. Elisha. Far as I dare, I will essay. Gehazi, My faithful friend and servant, take my staff, Speed thou to Shunem, and with rev'rend awe Extend it on the bosom of the child. Woman. Nay, holy man of God, do not transfer This work to other hands—come thou thyself, And raise and thy pow'rful prayers in my behalf, Or to her home thy suppliant ne'er returns, But here remains, fix'd to this hallow'd spot, An ever during monument of grief. AIR. Here my tears shall ever flow, Here I'll pour unceasing woe, Carmel shall lament my son, Her hills prove vocal with my moan, And echo fill the list'ning air With cries of anguish and despair. RECITATIVE. Elisha. Thy sorrows have prevail'd. It shall be so. I will to Shunem strait, and if the deed Incur presumption's name, thy holy tears, (Too strong for human bosom to resist) Must plead for pardon at the throne of grace. AIR, in Parts. Woman. May every blessing heav'n can shed, Fall frequent o'er thy rev'rend head! Due as morn shall greet mine eye, For this my pray'r shall pierce the sky, And Western vales receive the sun, Or e're my grateful task be done. Elisha. Yet let not over-weening hope Too far exalt thine ardent mind, To God's decisive edict stoop, Be patient, duteous, and resign'd. Both. May ev'ry blessing heav'n can shed, Fall frequent o'er thy reverend virtuous head. Woman. You teach me how to frame my mind. Elisha. Exalt not then thine ardent mind. Both. Be patient, duteous, and resigned. RECITATIVE. Afflicted mother, come; abide the proof With firmness. Fill'd with doubt and dread, I go. AIR. Gehazi. As ye pursue your virtuous way May roseate sweets beneath you rise May softest breezes round ye play, And gales of fragrance fill the skies! May every charm that Nature yields, Successive rise to glad your view; For you may summer deck the fields, And winter wear no frowns to you. RECITATIVE. Husband and Neighbours at Shunem. Friend. Nay, bury not in gloomy silence thus Thy feelings, reverend Sire—Give sorrow vent, Yet do not banish hope; thy wife may bring Some pleasing tidings from the holy mount. Husband. Thence springs my greatest hope. Religion arms me To bear the stroke of fate. My son is dead, Such was the will of God, and to that will Submissively I bend—But that high power, Who for his favour'd race in Egypt's land Wrought dreadful wonders! he can with a word, Ev'n from the dreary mansion of the tomb, Upraise my son, to laud his wond'rous name. CHORUS. Almighty God! thy pow'rful word, Tremendous bade the thunders roll, The lightning flash, the ocean rage, And shake the world from pole to pole. Who erst in Egypt wonders wrought, And darkness brought at his command, With fire mingl'd with the hail, He swept destruction o'er the land. In wat'ry heaps the red sea stood, And made a path his race to save, Which Pharoah and his host assay'd, And in the trial found their grave. The scatter'd host now floating lie, Or to the bottom sink like stone; 'Twas thus proud Egypt's mighty host By Israel's God was overthrown. RECITATIVE. Friend. Lo, thy dear wife appears; with eager pace She moves. Husband. And following near, that holy man, The good Elisha comes. Immortal pow'rs! What wond'rous worth is his! They gain the porch; Greet him with silent awe; for, as I think, His mind devoutly bent on her request, Admits no other thought. Woman. Thou judgest right, He seeks the bed of death, I cannot speak What here I feel. A thousand mingled passions Are struggling in my breast. My friends forbear, Pursue him not, true piety demands No witnesses, alone he would address His fervent supplications. AIR. Air. Let solemn silence reign, No sound nor echo rude, This awful hour profane, This hour of working good. A SOLEMN SYMPHONY to the following Supplication. The Prophet with the Child alone. Elisha. O King of Kings! O Lord of Lords! Thy gracious ear incline; Forgive the bold presumptuous words, That pierce the sacred shrine. Thou at whose breath imprison'd light Burst from the cave of ancient night. Here extend thy wond'rous pow'r This infant's life restore, Returning warmth and strength impart, And heal the pious parent's heart. RECITATIVE. Husband, Woman, and Neighbours. Woman. Am I deceiv'd? or did the Prophet's voice Strike on my list'ning ear? ah me! my heart Is cold, I know not what to hope or fear. Husband. The proof is nigh, the sacred door unfolds. Friend. Favour'd of women! lo, the Seer invites With look inspir'd, our presence at the bed; Kneel we around, and wait his holypurpose. AIR. Elisha. Jehovah hears my ardent pray'rs, Jehovah grants my boon; Afflicted mother, dry thy tears, Receive, receive thy son. LOUD CHORUS of Neighbours. Jehovah hears the Prophet's pray'rs, Jehovah grants his boon; Afflicted parents, dry your tears Behold, behold your son. RECITATIVE. Accompanied. Son. Forms angelic! visions bright, Whither, whither are ye flown? Scenes of wonder and delight, Whither, whither are ye gone? Where are now those lovely bowers, Fragrant with a thousand flowers, Throng'd with little beauteous boys, Who in sweetly melting voice, To music temper'd, seem to say, ‘Brother haste, and join our lay, ‘Here we keep our revels gay, ‘Come and share them, come away.’ AIR. Who now are these who fill the space? O, sight of joy, my mother's face? My father, mother, both I see; Thro' glist'ning tears they smile on me; Receive and bless your favour'd boy, Whose dreams are bliss, whose wakings, joy. RECITATIVE. Woman. O fullness of delight? my dearest husband. And thou, my new-recover'd blessing, kneel, Kneel to this pious friend, this guardian saint; And pour your souls in gratitude and praise. Elisha. Forbear, forbear, to me no thanks are due. Let your adoring eyes to heav'n be rais'd, 'Twas God's own work; to him pour all your notes Of gratitude, and let the gen'ral voice Of Israel join to waft the swelling strain, In sounds of triumph, to the throne of grace. LAST HYMN AND CHORUS. Elisha. Awake the loud ecstatic lay, To God eternal praises pay, Who spoke creation into day, For his greatness endureth for ever. CHORUS. For his greatness &amp;c. Gehazi. To him whose span all being bound, Whose hand the sun with splendor crown'd, And wheel'd the glitt'ring planets round, For his wisdom endureth for ever. Husband. Who guards us with a parent's eye, Who pitying hears us when we cry, And turns our sorrow into joy, For his goodness endureth for ever. Woman. Who bids the weeper cease to mourn, And, ev'n from the relentless urn, Bids the rekindling soul return, For his mercy endureth for ever. Son. Who deigns our little life prolong, Nor scorns the pure and grateful song, Tho' warbled from an infant's tongue, For his kindness endureth for ever. All. Awake anew th' ecstatic lay, To God eternal praises pay, And shout to everlasting day, That his glory endureth for ever. CHORUS That his glory, &amp;c. Hallelujah! FINIS.</field>
