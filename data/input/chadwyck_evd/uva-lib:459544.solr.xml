      <field name="fulltext">DEUS Ego sum alpha et omega, I, primus et novissimus. I, God, moste of majestye, in whom begininge none may bee; enlesse alsoe, moste of postee, I am and have binne ever. Now heaven and earth is made through mee. The earth is voyd ondly I see; therfore light for more lee through my might I will liever. At my byddynge made be light. Light is good, I see in sight. Twynned shalbe through my might the light from thestearnes. Light âdayâ I wilbe called aye, and thestearnes ânightâ, as I saye. This morne and evene, the first day, is made full and expresse. Now will I make the firmament in myddeste the water to bee lent, for to bee a divident to twynne the waters aye; above the welkyn, beneath alsoe, and âheavenâ hit shalbe called thoo. This commen is morne and even also of the seoconde daye. Now will I waters everychone that under heaven bine great one, that the gather into one, and drynesse sone them shewe. That dryenesse âyearthâ men shall call. The gatheringe of the waters all, âseeyesâ to [name] have the shall; therby men shall them knowe. I will one yearth yerbes springe, ichon in kinde seede-gevinge; trees diverse fruite forth bringe after ther kynde eachone; the seede of which aye shalbe within the fruite of each tree. This morne and even of dayes three is both commen and gonne. Now will I make through my might lightninges in the welkyn bright, to twyne the daye from the night and lighten the earth with lee. Great lightes I will tooâ the sonne and eke the moone alsoâ the sonne for day to serve for oo, the moone for night to bee. Stares also through myne entente I will make one the firmamente, the yearth to lighten there the be lent; and knowne may be therby courses of planets, nothinge amisse. Now see I this worke good iwisse. This morninge and evon both made is, the fourthe day fullye. Now will I in waters fishe forth bringe, fowles in the firmament flyinge, great whalles in the sea swiminge; all make I with a thoughteâ beastes, fowles, fruit, stone, and tree. These workes are good, well I see. Therfore to blesse all well liketh me, this worke that I have wrought. All beastes, I byd you multyplye in yearth and water by and by, and fowles in the ayre to flye, the yearth to fulfill. This morne and evon through my might of the fiveth day and the night is made and ended well aright, all at my owne will. Now will I one earth bringe forth anon all helpely beastes, everychone that crepon, flyen, or gone, eachon in his kynde. Now is this donne at my byddinge: beastes goinge, flyinge, and crepinge; and all my worke at my likinge fully now I fynde. Then goinge from the place where he was, commeth to the place where he createth Adam. Now heaven and earth is made expresse, make wee man to our likenesse. Fishe, fowle, beastâmore and lesseâ to mayster he shall have might. To our shape now make I thee; man and woman I will there bee. Growe and multyplye shall yee, and fulfill the earth on hight. To helpe thee thou shalt have here herbes, trees, fruit, seede in fere. All shalbe put in thy power, and beastes eke alsoe; all that in yearth bine livinge, fowles in the ayre flyinge, and all that gost hath and likinge, to sustayne you from woe. Now this is donne, I see aright, and all thinge made through my might. The sixt day heare in my sight ys made all of the best. Heaven and earth ys wrought all within and all that needes to be therin. Tomorrowe, the seaventh day, I will blinne and of workes take my rest. But this man that I have made, with goste of lief I will him gladde. Adam rysinge. DEUS Rise up, Adam, rise up, ryse, a man full of sowle and liefe, and come with mee to paradice, a place of deyntee and delite. But it is good that thou be wise; bringe not thyselfe in striefe. Then the creatour bringeth Adam into paradice, before the tree of knowledge, and saith (minstrelles playe): DEUS Here, Adam, I give thee this place, thee to comforte and solace, to keepe it well while thou hit hasse, and donne as I thee bydd. Of all trees that bine herein thou shalt eate and nothinge sinne; but of this tree, for weale nor wynne, thou eate by noe way. What tyme thou eates of this tree, death thee behoves, leave thow mee. Therfore this fruit I will thee flee, and be thou not too bould. Beastes and fowles that thou may see to thee obedyent shall they bee. What name they bee given by thee, that name they shall hould. Then God taketh Adam by the hande and causeth him to lye downe, and taketh a ribbe out of his syde and saith: DEUS Hit is not good man only to bee; helpe to him now make wee. But excice sleepe behoves mee anon in this man heare. One sleepe thou arte, well I see. Heare a bone I take of thee, and fleshe alsoe with harte free to make thee a feere. Then God doth make the woman of the ribbe of Adam, wakinge and sayth to God: ADAM A, lorde, where have I longe bine? For sythence I slepte much have I seeneâ wonder that withouten weene hereafter shalbe wiste. DEUS Ryse, Adam, and awake. Heare have I formed the a make; hir to thee thou shalt take, and name hir as thee liste. Adam, rysinge up, saith: ADAM I see well, lord, through thy grace bonne of my bones thou hir mase; and fleshe of my fleshe shee hase, and my shape through thy sawe. Therfore shee shalbe called, iwisse, âviragooâ, nothinge amisse; for out of man taken shee is, and to man shee shall drawe. Of earth thou madest first mee, both bone and fleshe; now I see thou hast her given through thy postee of that I in me had. Therfore man kyndely shall forsake father and mother, and to wife take; too in one fleshe, as thou can make, eyther other for to glad. Then Adam and Eve shall stand naked and shall not bee ashamed. Then the serpente shall come up out of a hole, and the dyvell walkinge shall say: DEMON Owt, owt, what sorrowe is this, that I have loste soe much blysse? For onste I thought to doe amysse, out of heaven I fell. The bryghtest angell I was or this, that ever was or yet is; but pryde cast me downe, iwisse, from heaven right into hell. Gostlye paradice I was in, but thence I fell through sinne. Of yeartly paradice now, as I weene, a man is given masterye. By Belsabubb, I will never blynne till I may make him by some gynne from that place for to twyne and trespasse as did I. Should such a caytiffe made of claye have such blisse? Nay, by my laye! For I shall teach his wiffe a playe and I may have a whyle. For her to disceave I hoppe I may, and through her brynge them both awaye; for shee will doe as I her saye, hir hoppe I will begylle. That woman is forbydden to doe for anythinge the will therto. Therfore that tree shee shall come to and assaye which it is. Dight me I will anone tyte and profer her of that ylke fruite; soe shall they both for her delyte bee banyshed from that blysse. A maner of an edder is in this place that wynges like a bryde shee haseâ feete as an edder, a maydens faceâ hir kynde I will take. And of the tree of paradice shee shall eate through my contyse; for wemen they be full licourouse, that will shee not forsake. And eate shee of hyt, full witterlye they shall fare both as dyd I: be banyshed both of that valley and hir osprynge for aye. Therfore, as brooke I my panne, the edders coate I will take one; and into paradice I will gonne as faste as ever I maye. Supremus volucris, penna serpens, pede forma, forma puella. SERPENS Woman, why was God soe nyce to byd you leave for your delice and of each tree in paradice to forsake the meate? EVA Nay, of the fruite of yche tree for to eate good leave have wee, save the fruite of one wee muste flee; of hyt wee may not eate. This tree heare that in the middest is, eate wee of hit wee doe amysse. God sayde we should dye iwys and if we touch that tree. SERPENS Woman, I saye leave not this; for hyt shall yee not loose the blysse nor noe joy that is his, but be as wyse as hee. God is subtyle and wisse of witte and wotteth well when ye eate it that your eyne shalbe unknyt. Like godes yee shalbe and knowe both good and evill alsoe. Therfore hee warned you therfroe. Yee may well wotte hee was your foe; therfore doe after mee. Take of this fruite and assaye; yt is good meate, I dare laye. And but thou finde yt to thy paye, say that I am false. And yee shall knowe bothe welle and woe and bee like godes both too, thou and thy husband alsoe. Take thou one apple and noe moo. EVA A, lord, this tree is fayre and bryght, greene and seemely to my sight, the fruite sweete and much of myght, that godes it may us make. One apple of yt I will eate to assaye which is the meate; and my husbande I will gett one morsell for to take. Then Eve shall take of the fruite of the serpente, and shall eate therof and say to Adam: EVA Adam, husbande liffe and deare, eate some of this apple here. Yt is fayre, my leeffe feare; hit may thou not forsake. ADAM That is soothe, Eve, withouten were; the fruit is sweete and passinge feare. Therfore I will doe thy prayerâ one morsell I will take. Then Adam shall take the fruite and eate therof, and in weepinge manner shall saye: ADAM Out, alas, what ayleth mee? I am naked, well I see. Woman, cursed mote thou bee, for wee bothe nowe shente. I wotte not for shame whyther to flee, for this fruite was forbydden mee. Now have I brooken, through reade of thee, my lordes commandemente. EVA Alas, this edder hathe done mee nye! Alas, hir reade why did I? Naked wee bine bothe forthy, and of our shappe ashamed. ADAM Yea, sooth sayde I in prophecye when thou was taken of my bodyeâ mans woe thou would bee witterlye; therfore thou was soe named. EVA Adam, husbande, I reade we take this figge-leaves for shames sake, and to our members an hillinge make of them for thee and mee. ADAM And therwith my members I will hide, and under this tree I will abyde; for surely come God us besyde, owt of this place shall wee. Then Adam and Eve shall cover ther members with leaves, hydinge themselves under the trees. Then God shall speake (minstrelles playe). DEUS Adam, Adam, where arte thou? [ADAM] A, lorde, I harde thy voyce nowe. For I naked am, I make avowe, therfore now I hyd mee. DEUS Whoe tould thee, Adam, thou naked was save only thy trespasse, that of the tree thou eaten hasse that I forbydd thee? ADAM Lord, this woman that is hereâ that thou gave to my feareâ gave mee parte at hir prayer, and of hyt I did eate. DEUS Woman, why hast thou donne soo? EVA This edder, lorde, shee was my foe and sothly mee disceaved alsoe, and made mee to eate that meate. DEUS Edder, for that thou haste donne this anye, amongste all beasts on earth thee by cursed thou shalt bee forthy, for this womans sake. Upon thy brest thou shalt goo, and eate the yearth to and froo; and emnytie betweene you too I insure thee I shall make. Betweene thy seede and hirs alsoe I shall excyte thy sorrowe and woe; to breake thy head and be thy foe, shee shall have masterye aye. Noe beast one earth, I thee behett, that man soe little shall of seett; and troden bee full under foote for thy mysdeede todaye. DEUS (ad Evam) And, woman, I warne thee witterlye, thy much payne I shall multyplyeâ with paynes, sorrowe, and great anye thy children thou shall beare. And for that thou haste done soe todaye, man shall master thee alwaye; and under his power thou shalte bee aye, thee for to dryve and deare. DEUS (ad Adam) And, man, alsoe I saye to theeâ for thou haste not donne after mee, thy wyves counsell for to flee, but donne soe hir byddinge to eate the fruite of thys tree, in thy worke warryed the earthe shalbe; and with greate travell behoves [thee] one earth to gett thy livinge. When thou one earth traveled hasse, fruite shall not growe in that place; but thornes, brears for thy trespasse to thee one earth shall springe. Herbes, rootes thou shalte eate and for thy sustenance sore sweate with great mischeyfe to wynne thy meate, nothinge to thy likinge. Thus shall thou live, soothe to sayen, for thou haste byne to mee unbayen, ever tyll the tyme thou turne agayne to yearth there thou came from. For earth thou arte, as well is seene; and after this worke, woe and teene, to earth there thou shalt, withouten weene, and all thy kynde alsoe. Adam shall speake mourninglye. ADAM Alas, now in longer I am ilente! Alas, nowe shamely am I shente! For I was unobedyente, of weale now am I wayved. Nowe all my kynde by mee ys kente to flee womens intycemente. Whoe trusteth them in any intente, truely hee is disceaved. My licourouse wyfe hath bynne my foe; the devylls envye shente mee alsoe. These too together well may goe, the suster and the brother. His wrathe hathe donne me muche woe; hir glotonye greved mee alsoe. God lett never man trust you too, the one more then the other. DEUS Nowe wee shall parte from this lee. Hilled behoveth you to to bee. Dead beaste skynes, as thinketh mee, ys best you one you beare. For deadly nowe both bine yee and death noe way may you flee. Such clothes are best for your degree and such shall yee weare. Then God, puttynge garmentes of skynnes upon them: DEUS Adam, nowe hast thou thy wyllynge, for thou desyred above all thinge of good and evell to have knowinge; nowe wrought is all thy will. Thou wouldeste knowe both weelle and woe; nowe is it fallen to thee soe. Therfore hence thou muste goo, and thy desyre fullfilled. Now lest thou [covett]este more and doe as thou haste donne beforeâ eate of this fruiteâto live evermore heare may thou not bee. To yearth thyder thou muste gonne; with travell leade thy liefe therone. For syccere there is noe other wonne. Goe forthe; take Eve with thee. Then God shall dryve Adam and Eve out of paradice, and sayth to the Angell (minstrelles playe): DEUS Nowe will I that there lenge within the angelles order Cherubynn, to keepe this place of weale and wynne that Adam lost thus hathe, with sharpe swordes one everye syde and flame of fyer here to abyde, that never a yearthly man in glyde; forgiven the bynne that grace. PRIMUS ANGELUS Lorde, that order that is righte is readye seett heare in thy syghte, with flame of fyer readye to fyghte agaynst mankynde, thy foe, to whom noe grace is claymed by righte. Shall none of them byde in thy sighte tyll Wysdome, Right, Mercye, and Mighte shall buy them and other moe. SECUNDUS ANGELUS I, Cherubyn, muste here bee chyce to keepe this place of great pryce. Sythenn man was soe unwyse, this wyninge I muste weareâ that hee by crafte or countyce shall not come in that was hise, but deprived bee of paradyce, noe more for to come there. TERCIUS ANGELUS And in this herytage I wilbe, still for to ever see that noe man come in this cyttye as God hath me beheight. Swordes of fyer have all wee to make mann from this place to flee, from this dwellinge of greate dayntee that to him first was dighte. QUARTUS ANGELUS And of this order I am made one, from mankynde to weare this wone that through his gilte hath forgone this wonninge full of grace. Therfore departe the must eycheone. Our swordes of fyer shall bee there bonne and myselfe there verye fonne, to flame them in the face. Minstrelles playe. ADAM Hight God and highest kynge, that of nought made all thingeâ beast, fowle, and grasse growingeâ and me of yearth made, thou gave me grace to doe thy wyllinge. For after great sorrowe and sikinge thou hast mee lent greate likinge, too sonnes my hearte to glade: Cayne and Abell, my childrenn deare, whome I gate within xxx yeare after the tyme wee depryved weare of paradyce for our pryde. Therfore nowe them will I lere, to make them knowe in good manere what I sawe when Eve, my feere, was taken of my syde. Whyle that I slepte in that place my gost to heaven banished was; for to see I ther had grace thinges that shall befall. To make you ware of comberouse case and lett your doinge from trespasse, sonne, I will tell before your faceâ but I will not tell all. I wott by things that I there see that God will come from heaven on hie, to overcome the devill soe slee and light into my kynde; and my blood that hee will wyne that I soe lost for my synne; a new lawe ther shall begine and soe men shall them sure. Water or fyer also witterlye all this world shall distroye, for men shall synne soe horryblye and doe full much amysse. Therfore that yee may escape that nye, doe well and be ware me bye. I tell you heare in prophecye that this will fall ywisse. Alsoe I see, as I shall saye, that God will come the laste daye to deeme mankynde in fleshe verey, and flame of fyer burninge, the good to heaven, the evell to hell. Your childrenn this tale yee may tell. This sight saw I in paradyce or I fell, as laye there sleepinge. Nowe will I tell howe yee shall doe Godes love to underfoo. Cayne, husbandes crafte thou must goe to; and Abell, a shepharde bee. Therfore of cornes fayre and cleane that growes one ridges out of reane, Cayne, thou shalt offer, as I meane, to God in majestee. And Abell, while thy lief shall laste thou shalt offerâand doe my hesteâ to God the first-borne beaste; therto thou make thee bowne. Thus shall yee please God almight if yee doe this well and righte, with good harte in his sight and full devotyon. Nowe for to gett you sustenance I will you teach withou distance. For sythen I feele that myschaunce of that fruite for to eate, my leefe children fayre and free, with this spade that yee may see I have dolven. Learne yee this at mee, howe yee shall wynne your meate. EVA My sweete children, darlinges deare, yee shall see how I live heare because enbuxone so wee weare and did as God would not wee shoulde. This payne, theras had bine no neede, I suffer on yearth for my misdeede; and of this wooll I will spyn threede by threede, to hill mee from the could. Another sorrowe I suffer alsoe: my childrenn must I beare with woo, as I have donne both you too; and soe shall wemen all. This was the divell, our bytter foe, that made us out of joy to goe. To please, therfore, sonnes bee throwe, in sinne that yee ne fall. CAYNE Mother, for sooth I tell yt thee, a tyllman I am and soe wilbe. As my father hath taught yt me, I will fulfill his lore. Hear he bringe in the plough. CAYNE Of corne I have great plentee; sacrifice to God sonne shall yee see. I will make too looke if hee will sende mee any more. ABELL And I will with devotyon to my sacrafice make mee bowne. The comelyest beaste, by my crowne, to the lorde I will choyse and offer yt before thee here, meeklye in good manere. Noe beast to thee may bee deare that may I not leese. Heare Adam and Eve goe out tyll Cayne have slayne Abell. CAYNE I am the elder of us too; therfore firste I will goe. Such as the fruite is fallen froo is good inough for him. This corne standinge, as mote I thee, was eaten with beastes, men may see. God, thou gettest noe other of mee, be thou never soe gryme. Hit weare pittye, by my panne, those fayre eares for to brenne. Therefore the devill honge mee then and thou of hit gett ought. This earles corne grewe nexte the waye; of these offer I will todaye. For cleane corne, by my faye, of mee gettest thou nought. Loe, lord, here may thou see such corne as grew to mee. Parte of hit I bringe to thee, anone withouten lett. I hope thou wilte white mee this and sende mee more of worldly blisse; ells forsooth thou doest amisse and thou bee in my debt. ABELL Now my brother, as I see, hathe done sacrafice to thee. Offer I will, as falleth for mee, suche as thou haste mee sente. The beste beaste, as mote I thee, of all my flocke with harte free to thee offered it shalbe. Receave, lorde, my presente. Then a flame of fyer shall descende upon thee sacrafice of Abell. ABELL Ah, high God and kinge of blisse, nowe sothly knowe I well by this my sacrafice accepted is before the lorde todaye. A flame of fyer thou sende hase from heaven one high into this place. I thanke thee, lorde, of thy grace and soe I shall doe aye. CAYNE Owt, owt! How have I spend my good? To see this sight I am neare wood. A flame of fyer from heaven stood one my brothers offeringe. His sacrafice I see God takes, and my refuses and forsakes. My semblant for shame shakes for envy of this thinge. DEUS (ad Cayne) Cayne, why arte thou wroth? Why? Thy semblant changes wonderously. If thou doe well and truely, thou may have meede of mee. Wottys thou not well that for thy deede yf thou doe well thou may have meede; if thou doe fowle, fowle for to speede and syccere therafter to bee? But, Cayne, thou shalt have all thy will, thy talent yf thou wilt fulfill. Synne of hit will thee spill and make thee evell to speede. Thy brother buxone aye shalbe and fully under thy postee; the luste therof pertaynes to thee. Advyse thee of thy deede. CAYNE A, well, well, ys yt soe? Come forth with mee. Thow must goe into the fyeld a little froo; I have and errande to saye. ABELL Brother, to the I am ready to goe with thee full meekly. For thou arte elder then am I, thy will I will doe aye. CAYNE Say, thou caytiffe, thou congeon, weneste thou to passe mee of renowne? Thou shalt fayle, by my crowne, of masterye yf I may. God hath challenged mee nowe heare for thee, and that in fowle manere; and that shalt thou abye full deare or that thou wende away. Thy offeringe God accept hase, I see by fyer that one yt was. Shalt thou never efte have such grace, for dye thou shalt this night. Though God stoode in this place for to helpe thee in this case, thou should dye before his face. Have this, and gett thee right! Then Cayne kylleth his brother Abell, and God comminge sayth (minstrelles playe): DEUS Cayne, where is thy brother Abell? CAYNE I wote nere; I cannot tell of my brother. Wottys thou not well that I of him had noe keepinge? DEUS What hast thou done, thou wicked man? Thy brothers blood askes thee upon vengeance as fast as it can, from yearth to me cryinge. Cayne, cursed one earth thou shalt bee aye. For thy deede thou haste donne todaye, yearth warryed shalbe in thy worke aye that wickedly haste wrought. And for that thow haste donne this mischeyfe, to all men thou shalt bye unleeffe, idell and wandringe as an theyfe and overall sett at nought. Cayne speaketh mornefullye. CAYNE Out, alas! Where may I bee? Sorrowe one eache syde I see. For yf I out of the lande flee from mens companye, beastes I wott will werrye mee. And yf I lenge, by my lewtye, I muste bee bonde and nothinge freeâ and all for my follye. For my sinne soe horryble is and I have donne soe muche amysse, that unworthy I am iwysse forgevenes to attayne. Well I wott where-ever I goe whoesoe meetes me will mee slowe, and yche man wilbe my foe. Noe grace to mee may gayne. DEUS Naye, Cayne, thou shalte not dye soone, horrybly if thou have aye donne. That is not thy brothers boone, thy blood for to sheede. But, forsoth, whosoever slayeth thee sevenfolde punished hee shalbee. And great payne maye thou not flee for thy wicked deede. But for thou to thys deede was bowne, thou and thy children trust monâ into the seaventh generationâ punishment for the whole. For thou todaye hase donne soe, thy seede for thee shall suffer woe; and whyle thou one yearth may goe, of vengeance have the dole. CAYNE Owt, owt, alas, alas! I am dampned without grace. Therfore I will from place to place and looke where is the best. Well I wott and witterly, into what place that come I, iche man will loath my companye; soe shall I never have rest. Fowle hape is mee befall: whether I bee in house or hall, âcursed Cayneâ menn will me call. Of sorrowes may non nowe cease. But yett will I, or I goe, speake with my dam and syre alsoe. And there maleson both too I wott well I must have. Dam and syre, rest you well, for one fowle tale I can you tell. I have slayne my brother Abell as we fell in a stryffe. ADAM Alas, alas, is Abell deade? Alas, rufull is my reade! Noe more joye to me is leade, save only Eve my wyfe. EVA Alas, nowe is my sonne slayne! Alas, marred is all my mayne! Alas, muste I never be fayne, but in woe and morninge? Well I wott and knowe iwysse that verye vengeance it is. For I to God soe did amysse, mone I never have lykinge. CAYNE Yea, dam and syre, farewell yee; for owt of land I will flee. A losell aye I muste bee, for scapit I am of thryfte. For soe God hath toulde mee, that I shall never thryve nee [thee]. And now I flee, all yee may see. I grant you all the same gifte. Finis</field>
