      <field name="fulltext">Terens in englysh. The translacyon out of latin into englysh of the furst comedy of tyrens callyd Andria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The poet. The famous renown through the worlde is spr?g Of poetys ornate that vsyd to indyte Of dyuers matters in theyr moder tong Some toke vppon them tr?slacions to wryte Some to compile bokys for theyr delyte But in our english tong for to speke playn I rede but of few haue take any gret payn. Except master Gowre which furst began And of moralite wrote ryght craftely Than master Chaucer that exellent man which wrote as compendious &amp; elygantly As in any other tong euer dyd any Ludgate also which adournyd our tong whose noble famys through the world be sprong. By these men our tong is amplyfyed so That we therin now translate as well may As in eny other tongis other can do yet the greke tong &amp; laten dyuers men say Haue many wordys can not be englyshid this day So lyke wyse in englysh many wordys do habound That no greke nor laten for them can be found. And the cause that our tong is so plenteouse now For we kepe our englysh contynually And of other tongis many wordis we borow which now for englysh we vse &amp; occupy These thingis haue gyuen corage gretly To dyuers &amp; specyally now of late To them that this comedy haue translate. which all discrete men now do besech And specyally lernyd men to take no dysdayn Though this be compylyd in our vulgare spech yet lernyng therby some men may attayn For they that in this comedy haue take payn Pray you to correct where faut shalbe found And of our matter lo here is the ground. Sometyme in athins that noble cyte A merchant callyd chremes had doughters two The one passibula which had gret beute The other philomena/then was there also One phania which was broder him vnto In athens these .ii. dwellyd many a day Tyll for fere of the warr chremes fled away. And this phania also fering the warr Toke ship &amp; fled after from thens apace And passibula his brothers doughter He toke wyth him for aferd he was To leue her behind him in that place And at the yle of andro his ship there brake That he was compellyd there land to take. And furst he chauncyd into a house there Of an old man dwellyng therby which had one Chrysys vnto his doughter Sone after this phania there dyd dye Then was passibula left desolately wythout any socour of all her frendys But after that dyed ther father of Chrysys. Then this Chrisis because that she thought To lyue better in some other cyte Cam to athenys to dwell &amp; thider brought Passibula wyth her/which for so gret bewte They callyd Glycery/this crysys than she Kept there an household somewhat defamyd To which much wanton company resortyd. So that a marchauntys sonne of the cyte Callyd pamphilus got a chyld of glycery Not knowing her chremes doughter to be yet simo his father appoyntyd him to mary Vnto philomena which was truly Chremes other doughter as I sayd before which one Carinus louyd very sore. But chremes to gyue his doughter dysagreed when Glycery gret wyth chyld he aspyde yet simo sayd the weddingis shuld procede And faynyd them onely to haue cause to chyde His sonne pamphilus if he it denyde Then dauus hys seruant perseyuyng his entent Bad pamphilus to his father consent. And thought that chremes woldnot gyue his doughter Nor that he shuld not be weddyd in dede And when simo hard his sonnis answer He prayd chremes to let the weddingis procede And so by his intysyng Chremes agreed Then dauus &amp; pamphilus so dysseyuyd were That what thing to do or say they wyst nere. Tyll that one Cryto from andro dyd repayre To the cyte of athenys purposely To clayme chrysys goodys as her next heyre Shewing all the sayd matter hole &amp; playnly How to the yle of Andro this Glycery was brought by her vncle callyd phania And that she was callyd than passibula. Then Chremes to remember him began Of his doughter &amp; phania his brother And by &amp; by he knew perfytely than That Glycery was his own very doughter Then both simo &amp; chremes contentyd were And Chremes gaue Glycery vnto pamphilus And philomena vnto charinus. Of this matter shall ron all our comedy which playnlyer anon declaryd shalbe But I must go I may no lenger tary The players be come now I do them se Lo this is simo it is tyme for me To go hens therfore I pray you all here To gyue audyence vnto the matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">the furst Act. The furst scene Simo the old man/Socia his seruant. Haue in thys gere now/sirs get ye hens Socia c? hether/for speke wyll I wyth the So. Syr kepe your tale/for I know your pretence Is me to se these thingis well ordryd to be Si. No it is a nother thing for a suerte So. why what other thing in the world now is wherin my craft may stede you more than this Si. This craft of thyn ys now to me nedeles for my purpose/but other thyngys whych I haue euer known in the as trewth &amp; secretnes So. Than to know your wyll I desyre gretly Si. After I had bought the in thyne infancy for thy seruice shuld be good &amp; iust to me Thow knowyst that of a b?dm? I made the free I gaue the there the best Iowell I had Because thou diddist me diligent seruice So. I wot well/ Si/ I repent not. So. &amp; I am glad yf I haue d? or do in any wyse That that may you symo please &amp; suffice And that it hath lykyd your godnes So to accept it I thank your gentilnes But this thyng yet take I somewhat in grefe For this thing which that ye to me do say Is as yt were a maner of reprefe As owt of my mynd I had cast away The good tornys done to me before this day But now syr shortly I requyre you that ye wold tell me at onys what ye wold wyth me Si. That shall I do but furst hark me lo The wedding? shall not be that thow lokist after So. why feyn ye them th?. Si. that thou shalt know From the begynnyng all the hole matter And my sonnys lyfe in thys thow shalte here And my counsell shalt thow know also And what I wolde haue the in this thing to do For doutles Socia after that tyme whan My son had ouer passid his infancy He was more able to rule hym self than For as thou wottyst wel before that surely How cowd a man know his mynd fully whyle that his age &amp; the drede also Of his maister were impedimentis therto So. Treuth. Si. th? for the most ?t all yong men be wont. Theyr mynd? to set to some maner study Some to norish horsis some hound? to hunt And some to lernyng of phylozophy But non of all these he studyed only Aboue all other nor gaf his mynd &amp; hart But of euerychone he lernyd a parte Then was I glad. So. so myght ye well be For yt is a thing most proffitable For a mannys lyfe in no wyse that he Study thing to moch but euer mesurable Si. Then soch was his lyf &amp; custome c?mendable All other men gladly for to ?fer And to obey in all goodly maner wyth wh? that he was he did hym self ordayne To folow theyr mynd? as moch as he myght And neuer was he ony man agayne Nor hym self ?farrid before an other wight So that by soch mean ye know a man might Get hym lawd withowt any enuy And frend? also. So. syr he dyd wysely For now adays we se it playne at eye That trewth gettith hatred and dilygens Gettith frendis this is sene playnly Si. well in the mene tyme abowt .iii. yere hens A woman of androw c? hydyr from thens For lak of frendis constreynid here to be Hole &amp; yong &amp; of excellent bewte So. Alas for now I do gretly fere Lest that some mychefe this androw do bryng Si. Furst she lyuyd in good honest maner Skarcely and hardly getting her lyuing wyth her handis as spynnyng &amp; carding But after onis that there cam a louer Furst one and after that an other Promysyng money as is the condicion Of all soch myndid on soch folyshnes From labour euyn to plesure falling down Redy and prone vnto voluptuousnes So that she fell in to the same lewdnes And in that thing incresid more &amp; more And toke grete rewardis of men therefore Than they that did vnto this woman long My son on a tyme wyth theym can take To kepe company wyth theym among Then to my self thought I and spake He is in loue wyth that noughty pake Than wachid I both day &amp; night wyth some of theyre serua?t? to speke if I might I callid one/childe I pray the qd I who had Chrysis yesterday tell thow me For that was her name of androw truly So. well. Si. Phedria Clinia or Nicerat quod he For louers all atonis were these thre what dyd pamphylus quod I Ithe pray But suppyd and payd his shot that I cowd se Then was I glad he nought ells cowd say A nother day eke of this inquere dyd I But nothing bel?gyng to hym cowd I see Than I thought hym prouyd soffycy?tly And that in hym was grete chastyte Seing hym so famylyar to be wyth theym that vsid soch maner of game And his mynde not mouyd to the same Then thow mayst know that able was he Of his owne lyfe to haue the gouerna?s It plesyd me also that it shold so be All men seyd well of hym wythowt varyaunce And all wyth one voyce praysid my chauns That I had a sonne of soch condic?n And eke indewid wyth soch disposycyon To make short tale Chremes of his own sw?g Striken wyth this fame cam vnto me His doughter to my sonne than ?fferyng And to gyue wyth her a grete dowere It plesyd me well that yt shold so be The weddingys appoyntid as this day were So. why be they not done th?. Si. that shalt thou here This Chrisis our neybour fortunyd to dye In the meane tyme that these thingys were So. O that happid well for euer more I As in my mynde this Chrysis dyd fere Si. And my sonne wyth theym that folowid the bere That louid her &amp; to make short tale I also Bycawse of my sonne with theym did go My sonne than lokid very heuyly And from his eye let fall many a tere yet was I then glad for this thought I For the lyttyll aquoyntaunce that he hath here yt greuith hym as though her louer he were How cowd he for me haue shewyd more kyndnes yet I thought all that came of gentylnes yet thoght I n? ill. so. what ist. si. thou shalt kno The corps went forth we folowid the bere Among the wymyn that there did go I happid to aspy a yong woman ther So. peraduenture good. Si. &amp; that ryght ?per In countenaunce &amp; fauorid so well That no wyght myght her bewty excell whose sorow excedid all that there were And for that she was semlyest of theym ychone I askyd of theym that folowid the bere who she was/Chrysis syster than sayd one It stroke than to my hart for I thought anon ffor this is his pyte and also his kyndnes ffor this is his wepyng for this is hys heuynes So. O that I fere what end thy tale will haue Si. In the meane whyle the corps forthe did pas we folowid/when we cam to the graue In to the fyre than put she was Thys forseyd syster being in the place ffolyshly and lyke a mad woman All perelowsly in to the fyre ran Then pamphylus in mynd all dismayd his hid before loue owt shewid he tho He ran and toke her by the myddill &amp; sayd My Glycery qd he what wilt thow do Thy self for to sle why doste thow go Then she as the wont loue one may well espye Tornyd to hym weping famylyarly. So. what sayst. Si. angry from th?s w?t I my way Nor yet this was not so god me mend Cause to chyde hym for this myght he say why father what dyd I offend I did but saue one that wold her self haue brend This shold haue bene his skuce at the lest And it ne had bene but good &amp; honest So. ye say well for if you shold hym chyde That helpith a woman in soch distres what more ponyshment ought they to abyde That doth theym hurt. Si. than cam Chremes Crieng to me &amp; sayd he saw dowtles That pamphylus had chosyn for suerte This straunger this woman his wyfe to be I sayd nay and he ye presysely In conclusion he yed his way me fro As he that to gyue his doughter did deny So. Didist not chyde thy son than. Si. forsoth no There was no cawse why I shold do so. So. No was? shew why. Si. for this might he haue sayd ye haue an ende to all these thing? purueid For the tyme is comyng that cha?gid must be This maner of lyu?g and after an other wyse Must I shortly lyue in mene whyle soffer me For to lyue I pray you after myne old gyse So. For what cause ought he now be chid Si. yf he for loue no wyfe will mary That wrong in hym must furst be ponishid And this thyng to know inquere now do I By fayned wedding? which yf he deny To chyde hym tham iust cawse may I haue Also Dauus that vngracious knaue yf he haue any cownsell that he may spend Though his disseyt? can do vs no dere whom I thynk full bysyly will tend wyth handis fete and all his other gere All thing to do that lyeth in his power So that he may hurt me therby And folow my sonnys mynd. So. what the dyuell why Si. A shrewd m?d an yllwill wh? if I kno But of these wordis now what is it nede Let it pas. but that that I wyll to Pamphylo Haue done suffer me that matter to spede But one thing restyth now in very dede which is that Chremes I must now intrete And I trust his good will to obtayn &amp; get Now is thy dewty wysely for to fayne These mariagis and to fere alway This knaue dauus &amp; eke also agayn My son for to wach both night &amp; day what he doth &amp; what counsell he takith ay So. Sir I shall take hede let vs go in now Si. Mary go before and I will folow. The .ii. scene Here. Simo. &amp; Dauus speke ich of them to him self a while. Simo. Dauus. his seruant. My sonne no wyfe will haue playnly I se For I saw well Dau? waxid aferd ther when that he hard the mariagis shold be But forth now he c?mith. Da. I meruell of this gere yf it thus pas/&amp; my masters softnes I fere For when he hard that his sonne shold not mary To non of vs he spake nor toke it heuyly Si. But now he will and yet as I trow Not with out thy grete hurt. Da. this thought he That we neclygently shold be opressid so Exempt from fere vnto wanhope brought to be Nothing to for cast nor no space haue shold we The mariagis that he hath wrought so sone In any wyse to disturb O craftely done Si. what sayth the horeson knaue what seyth he Da. My mayster is here and I was not ware Si. Dauus. Da. who ist that wold haue me Si. Com hyther syr come hyther nar Da. what will ye. Si. what sayst. Da. what is the mater Si. That my sonne louith a rumour ther is Da. The people care much for that syr Iwis. Si. Takist hede to this. da. I here you well ywis Si. But now for me these thingys owt to try It were a wykid fathers dede for before this what he hath done is nothing to me truly whyle tyme therto wold soffer hym than I To fulfill his mynd lyberte hym gaue But this tyme other lyfe and maners wyll haue Now dauus I requyre and pray the thys yf it be couenyent that he may come into The right way. Da. I maruell what this is Si All that be louers take it greuously lo Maried to be. Da. many men say so Si.
