      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, The Palace. Doodle, Noodle. Doodle. Sure, such a Corneille recommends some very remarkable Day, wherein to fix the Action of a Tragedy. This the best of our Tragical Writers have understood to mean a Day remarkable for the Serenity of the Sky, or what we generally call a fine Summer's Day: So that according to this their Exposition, the same Months are proper for Tragedy, which are proper for Pastoral. Most of our celebrated English Tragedies, as Cato, Mariamne, Tamerlane, &amp;c. begin with their Observations on the Morning. Lee seems to have come the nearest to this beautiful Description of our Authors; The Morning dawns with an unwonted Crimson, The Flowers all odorous seem, the Garden Birds Sing louder, and the laughing Sun ascends, The gaudy Earth with an unusual brightness, All Nature smiles. Cæs. Borg. Massinissa in the new Sophonisba is also a Favourite of the Sun; —The Sun too seems As conscious of my Joy with broader Eye To look abroad the World, and all things smile Like Sophonisba. Memnon in the Persian Princess, makes the Sun decline rising, that he may not peep on Objects, which would prophane his Brightness. —The Morning rises slow, And all those ruddy Streaks that us'd to paint The Days Approach, are lost in Clouds as if The Horrors of the Night had sent 'em back, To warn the Sun, he should not leave the Sea, To Peep, &amp;c. Day as this was never seen! The Sun himself, on this auspicious Day, Shines, like a Beau in a new Birth-Day Suit: This down the Seams embroider'd, that the Beams. All Nature wears one universal Grin. Nood. This Day, O Mr. Doodle, is a Day Indeed, This Line is highly conformable to the beautiful Simplicity of the Antients. It hath been copied by almost every Modern, Not to be is not to be in Woe. State of Innocence. Love is not Sin but where 'tis sinful Love. Don Sebastian. Nature is Nature, Lælius. Sophonisba. Men are but Men, we did not make our selves. Revenge. a Day we never saw before. The mighty Dr. B?y reads the mighty Tall-mast Thumb. Mr. D?s the mighty Thumping Thumb. Mr. T?d reads Thundering. I think Thomas more agreeable to the great Simplicity so apparent in our Author. Thomas Thumb victorious comes; Millions of Giants crowd his Chariot Wheels, That learned Historian Mr. S?n in the third Number of his Criticism on our Author, takes great Pains to explode this Passage. It is, says he, difficult to guess what Giants are here meant, unless the Giant Despair in the Pilgrim's Progress, or the Giant Greatness in the Royal Villain; for I have heard of no other sort of Giants in the Reign of King Arthur. Petrus Burmanus makes three Tom Thumbs, one whereof he supposes to have been the same Person whom the Greeks called Hercules, and that by these Giants are to be understood the Centaurs slain by that Heroe. Another Tom Thumb he contends to have been no other than the Hermes Trismegistus of the Antients. The third Tom Thumb he places under the Reign of King Arthur, to which third Tom Thumb, says he, the Actions of the other two were attributed. Now tho' I know that this Opinion is supported by an Assertion of Justus Lipsius, Thomam illum Thumbum non alium quam Herculem fuisse satis constat; yet shall I venture to oppose one Line of Mr. Midwinter, against them all, In Arthur's Court Tom Thumb did live. But then, says Dr. B?y, if we place Tom Thumb in the Court of King Arthur, it will be proper to place that Court out of Britain, where no Giants were ever heard of. Spencer, in his Fairy Queen, is of another Opinion, where describing Albion he says, —Far within a salvage Nation dwelt Of hideous Giants. And in the same Canto, Then Elfar, who two Brethren Giants had, The one of which had two Heads— The other three. Risum teneatis, Amici. Giants! to whom the Giants in Guild-hall Are Infant Dwarfs. They frown, and foam, and roar, While Thumb regardless of their Noise rides on. So some Cock-Sparrow in a Farmer's Yard, Hops at the Head of an huge Flock of Turkeys. Dood. When Goody Thumb first brought this Thomas forth, The Genius of our Land triumphant reign'd; Then, then, Oh Arthur! did thy Genius reign. Nood. They tell me it is To Whisper in Books says Mr. D?s is errant Nonsense. I am afraid this learned Man does not sufficiently understand the extensive meaning of the Word Whisper. If he he had rightly understood what is meant by the Senses Whisp'ring the Soul in the Persian Princess, or what Whisp'ring like Winds is in Aurengzebe, or like Thunder in another Author, he would have understood this. Emmeline in Dryden sees a Voice, but she was born blind, which is an Excuse Panthea cannot plead in Cyrus, who hears a sight. —Your Description will surpass, All Fiction, Painting, or dumb Shew of Horror, That ever Ears yet heard, or Eyes beheld. When Mr. D?s understands these he will undestand Whisp'ring in Books. whisper'd in the Books Of all our Sages, that this mighty Hero By Merlin's Art begot, hath not a Bone Within his Skin, but is a Lump of Gristle. Dood. Then 'tis a Gristle of no mortal kind, Some God, my Noodle, stept into the Place Of Gaffer Thumb, and more than —Some Ruffian stept into his Father's Place, And more than half begot him. Mary Q. of Scots. half begot, This mighty Tom. Nood. — —For Ulamar seems sent Express from Heaven, To civilize this rugged Indian Clime. Liberty Asserted. Sure he was sent Express From Heav'n, to be the Pillar of our State. Tho' small his Body be, so very small, A Chairman's Leg is more than twice as large; Yet is his Soul like any Mountain big, And as a Mountain once brought forth a Mouse, Omne majus continet in se minus, sed minus non in se majus continere potest, says Scaliger in Thumbo.—I suppose he would have cavilled at these beautiful Lines in the Earl of Essex; —Thy most inveterate Soul, That looks through the foul Prison of thy Body. And at those of Dryden, The Palace is without too well design'd, Conduct me in, for I will view thy Mind. Aurengzebe. So doth this Mouse contain a mighty Mountain. Dood. Mountain indeed! So terrible his Name, Mr. Banks hath copied this almost Verbatim, It was enough to say, here's Essex come, And Nurses still'd their Children with the fright. E. of Essex. The Giant Nurses frighten Children with it; And cry Tom Thumb is come, and if you are Naughty, will surely take the Child away. Nood. But hark! The Trumpet in a Tragedy is generally as much as to say enter King: Which makes Mr. Banks in one of his Plays call it the Trumpet's formal Sound. these Trumpets speak the King's Approach. Dood. He comes most luckily for my Petition. Flourish. SCENE II. King, Queen, Grizzle, Noodle, Doodle, Foodle. King. Phraortes in the Captives seems to have been acquainted with King Arthur. Proclaim a Festival for seven Days space, Let the Court shine in all its Pomp and Lustre, Let all our Streets resound with Shouts of Joy; Let Musick's Care-dispelling Voice be heard, The sumptuous Banquet, and the flowing Goblet Shall warm the Cheek, and fill the Heart with Gladness. Astarbe shall sit Mistress of the Feast. Let nothing but a Face of Joy appear; The Man who frowns this Day shall lose his Head, That he may have no Face to frown withal. Smile, Dollalolla—Ha! what wrinkled Sorrow, Repentance frowns on thy contracted Brow. Sophonisba. Hung on his clouded Brow, I mark'd Despair. Ibid. —A sullen Gloom, Scowls on his Brow. Busiris. Hangs, sits, lies, frowns upon thy knitted Brow? Whence flow those Tears fast down thy blubber'd Cheeks, Like a swoln Gutter, gushing through the Streets? Queen. Plato is of this Opinion, and so is Mr. Banks; Behold these Tears sprung from fresh Pain and Joy. E. of Essex. Excess of Joy, my Lord, I've heard Folks say, Gives Tears as certain as Excess of Grief. King. If it be so, let all Men cry for Joy, These Floods are very frequent in the Tragick Authors. Near to some murmuring Brook I'll lay me down, Whose Waters if they should too shallow flow, My Tears shall swell them up till I drown. Lee's Sophonisba. Pouring forth Tears at such a lavish Rate, That were the World on Fire, they might have drown'd The Wrath of Heav'n, and quench'd the mighty Ruin. Mithridates. One Author changes the Waters of Grief to those of Joy, —These Tears that sprung from Tides of Grief, Are now augmented to a Flood of Joy. Cyrus the Great. Another, Turns all the Streams of Hate, and makes them flow In Pity's Channel. Royal Villain. One drowns himself, —Pity like a Torrent pours me down, Now I am drowning all within a Deluge. Anna Bullen. Cyrus drowns the whole World, Our swellin Grief Shall melt into a Deluge, and the World Shall drown in Tears. Cyrus the Great. 'Till my whole Court be drowned with their Tears; Nay, till they overflow my utmost Land, And leave me Nothing but the Sea to rule. Dood. My Liege, I a Petition have here got. King. Petition me no Petitions, Sir, to-day; Let other Hours be set apart for Business. To-day it is our Pleasure to be An Expression vastly beneath the Dignity of Tragedy, says Mr. D?s, yet we find the Word he cavils at in the Mouth of Mithridates less properly used and applied to a more terrible Idea; I would be drunk with Death. Mithrid. The Author of the New Sophonisba taketh hold of this Monosyllable, and uses it pretty much to the same purpose, The Carthaginian Sword with Roman Blood Was drunk. I would ask Mr. D?s which gives him the best Idea, a drunken King, or a drunken Sword? Mr. Tate dresses up King Arthur's Resolution in Heroicks, Merry, my Lord, o'th' Captain's Humour right, I am resolv'd to be dead drunk to Night. Lee also uses this charming Word; Love's the Drunkenness of the Mind. Gloriana. drunk, And this our Queen shall be as drunk as We. Queen. (Tho' I already Dryden hath borrowed this, and applied it improperly, I'm half Seas o'er in Death. Cleom. half Seas over am) If the capacious Goblet overflow With Arrack-Punch—'fore George! I'll see it out; Of Rum, and Brandy, I'll not taste a Drop. King. Tho' Rack, in Punch, Eight Shillings be a Quart, And Rum and Brandy be no more than Six, Rather than quarrel, you shall have your Will. [Trumpets. But, ha! the Warrior comes; the Great Tom Thumb; The little Hero, Giant-killing Boy, Preserver of my Kingdom, is arrived. SCENE III. Tom Thumb, to them with Officers, Prisoners, and Attendants. King. This Figure is in great use among the Tragedians; 'Tis therefore, therefore 'tis. Victim. I long repent, repent and long again. Busiris. Oh! welcome most, most welcome to my Arms, What Gratitude can thank away the Debt, Your Valour lays upon me. Queen. — A Tragical Exclamation. Oh! ye Gods! [Aside. Thumb. When I'm not thank'd at all, I'm thank'd enough, This Line is copied verbatim in the Captives. I've done my Duty, and I've done no more. Queen. Was ever such a Godlike Creature seen! [Aside. King. Thy Modesty's a We find a Candlestick for this Candle in two celebrated Authors; —Each Star withdraws His golden Head and burns within the Socket. Nero. A Soul grown old and sunk into the Socket. Sebastian. Candle to thy Merit, It shines itself, and shews thy Merit too. But say, my Boy, where did'st thou leave the Giants? Thumb. My Liege, without the Castle Gates they stand, The Castle Gates too low for their Admittance. King. What look they like? Thumb. Like Nothing but Themselves. Queen. This Simile occurs very frequently among the Dramatick Writers of both Kinds. And sure thou art like nothing but thy Self. King. Enough! the vast Idea fills my Soul. [Aside. I see them, yes, I see them now before me. The monst'rous, ugly, barb'rous Sons of Whores. But, Ha! what Form Majestick strikes our Eyes? Mr. Lee hath stolen this Thought from our Author; —This perfect Face, drawn by the Gods in Council, Which they were long a making. Lu. Jun. Brut. —At his Birth, the heavenly Council paus'd, And then at last cry'd out, This is a Man! Dryden hath improved this Hint to the utmost Perfection: So perfect, that the very Gods who form'd you, wonder'd At their own Skill, and cry'd, A lucky Hit Has mended our Design! Their Envy hindred, Or you had been Immortal, and a Pattern, When Heaven would work for Ostentation sake, To copy out again. All for Love. Banks prefers the Works of Michael Angelo to that of the Gods; A Pattern for the Gods to make a Man by, Or Michael Angelo to form a Statue. So perfect, that it seems to have been drawn By all the Gods in Council: So fair she is, That surely at her Birth the Council paus'd, And then at length cry'd out, This is a Woman! Thumb. Then were the Gods mistaken.—She is not A Woman, but a Giantess—whom we It is impossible says Mr. W? sufficiently to admire this natural easy Line. With much ado, have made a shift to hawl Within the Town: This Tragedy which in most Points resembles the Antients differs from them in this, that it assigns the same Honour to Lowness of Stature, which they did to Height. The Gods and Heroes in Homer and Virgil are continually described higher by the Head than their Followers, the contrary of which is observ'd by our Author: In short, to exceed on either side is equally admirable, and a Man of three Foot is as wonderful a sight as a Man of nine. for she is by a Foot, Shorter than all her Subject Giants were. Glum. We yesterday were both a Queen and Wife, One hundred thousand Giants own'd our Sway, Twenty whereof were married to our self. Queen. Oh! happy State of Giantism—where Husbands Like Mushrooms grow, whilst hapless we are forc'd To be content, nay, happy thought with one. Glum. But then to lose them all in one black Day, That the same Sun, which rising, saw me wife To Twenty Giants, setting, should behold Me widow'd of them all.— My Blood leaks fast, and the great heavy lading My Soul will quickly sink. Mithrid. My Soul is like a Ship. Injur'd Love. My worn out Heart, That Ship, leaks fast, and the great heavy Lading, My Soul, will quickly sink. Queen. —Madam, believe, I view your Sorrows with a Woman's Eye; But learn to bear them with what Strength you may, To-morrow we will have our Grenadiers Drawn out before you, and you then shall chose What Husbands you think fit. Glum. — This well-bred Line seems to be copied in the Persian Princess; To be your humblest, and most faithful Slave. Madam, I am Your most obedient, and most humble Servant. King. Think, mighty Princess, think this Court your own, Nor think the Landlord me, this House my Inn; Call for whate'er you will, you'll Nothing pay. This Doubt of the King puts me in mind of a Passage in the Captives, where the Noise of Feet is mistaken for the Rustling of Leaves, —Methinks I hear The sound of Feet No, 'twas the Wind that shook yon Cypress Boughs. I feel a sudden Pain within my Breast, Nor know I whether it arise from Love, Or only the Wind-Cholick. Time must shew. Oh Thumb! What do we to thy Valour owe? Ask some Reward, great as we can bestow. Thumb. Mr. Dryden seems to have had this Passage in his Eye in the first Page of Love Triumphant. I ask not Kingdoms, I can conquer those, I ask not Money, Money I've enough; For what I've done, and what I mean to do, For Giants slain, and Giants yet unborn, Which I will slay—if this be call'd a Debt, Take my Receipt in full—I ask but this, Don Carlos in the Revenge suns himself in the Charms of his Mistress, While in the Lustre of her Charms I lay. To Sun my self in Huncamunca's Eyes. King. Prodigious bold Request. [Aside. Queen. — A Tragical Phrase much in use Be still my Soul. [Aside. Thumb. This Speech hath been taken to pieces by several Tragical Authors who seem to have rifled it and shared its Beauties among them. My Soul waits at the Portal of thy Breast, To ravish from thy Lips the welcome News. Anna Bullen. My Soul stands listning at my Ears. Cyrus the Great. Love to his Tune my jarring Heart would bring, But Reason overwinds and cracks the String. D. of Guise. —I should have lov'd, Tho' Jove in muttering Thunder had forbid it. New Sophonisba. And when it (my Heart) wild resolves to love no more, Then is the Triumph of excessive Love. Ibidem. My Heart is at the Threshold of your Mouth, And waits its answer there—Oh! do not frown, I've try'd, to Reason's Tune, to tune my Soul, But Love did overwind and crack the String. Tho' Jove in Thunder had cry'd out, You Shan't, I should have lov'd her still—for oh strange fate, Then when I lov'd her least, I lov'd her most. King. It is resolv'd—the Princess is your own. Thumb. Massinissa is one fourth less happy than Tom Thumb. Oh! happy, happy, happy. New Sophonisba. Oh! happy, happy, happy, happy, Thumb! Queen. Consider, Sir, reward your Soldiers Merit, But give not Huncamunca to Tom Thumb. King. Tom Thumb! Odzooks, my wide extended Realm Knows not a Name so glorious as Tom Thumb. Let Macedonia, Alexander boast, Let Rome her Cæsar's and her Scipio's show, Her Messieurs France, let Holland boast Mynheers, Ireland her O's , her Mac's let Scotland boast, Let England boast no other than Tom Thumb. Queen. Tho' greater yet his boasted Merit was, He shall not have my Daughter, that is Pos'. King. Ha! sayst thou Dollalolla? Queen. —I say he shan't. King. No by my self. Anna Bullen. Then by our Royal Self we swear you lye: Queen. —Who caus'd, This dreadful Revolution in my Fate, Ulamar. Who but a Dog, who but a Dog. Liberty Asserted. Who but a Dog, who but a Dog, Would use me as thou dost. Me, who have lain —A Bride, Who twenty Years lay loving by your Side. Banks. These twenty Years so loving by thy Side. But I will be reveng'd. I'll hang my self, Then tremble all who did this Match persuade, For born upon a Cloud, from high I'll fall, And rain down Royal Vengeance on you all. Albion Queen. For riding on a Cat, from high I'll fall, And squirt down Royal Vengeance on you all. Food. An Information very like this we have in the Tragedy of Love, where Cyrus having stormed in the most violent manner, Cyaxares observes very calmly, Why, Nephew Cyrus—you are mov'd. Her Majesty the Queen is in a Passion. King. 'Tis in your Choice, Love me, or love me not. Conquest of Granada. Be she, or be she not—I'll to the Girl And pave thy Way, oh Thumb—Now, by our self, We were indeed a pretty King of Clouts, To truckle to her Will—For when by Force Or Art the Wife her Husband over-reaches, Give him the Peticoat, and her the Breeches. Thumb. There is not one Beauty in this Charming Speech, but hath been borrowed by almost every Tragick Writer. Whisper, ye Winds, that Huncamunca's mine; Echoes repeat, that Huncamunca's mine! The dreadful Bus'ness of the War is o'er, And Beauty, heav'nly Beauty! crowns my Toils, I've thrown the bloody Garment now aside, And Hymeneal Sweets invite my Bride. So when some Chimney-Sweeper, all the Day, Hath through dark Paths pursu'd the sooty Way, At Night, to wash his Hands and Face he flies, And in his t'other Shirt with his Brickdusta lies. SCENE IV. Grizzle solus. Mr. Banks has (I wish I could not say too servilely) imitated this of Grizzle in his Earl of Essex. Where art thou Essex, &amp;c. Where art thou Grizzle? where are now thy Glories? Where are the Drums that waken'd thee to Honour? Greatness is a lac'd Coat from Monmouth-Street, Which Fortune lends us for a Day to wear, To-morrow puts it on another's Back. The spiteful Sun but yesterday survey'd His Rival, high as Saint Paul's Cupola; Now may he see me as Fleet-Ditch laid low SCENE V. Queen, Grizzle. Queen. The Countess of Nottingham in the Earl of Essex is apparently acquainted with Dollalolla. Teach me to scold, prodigious-minded Grizzle. Mountain of Treason, ugly as the Devil, Teach this confounded hateful Mouth of mine, To spout forth Words malicious as thy self, Words, which might shame all Billingsgate to speak. Griz. Far be it from my Pride, to think my Tongue Your Royal Lips can in that Art instruct, Wherein you so excel. But may I ask, Without Offence, wherefore my Queen would scold? Queen. Wherefore, Oh! Blood and Thunder! han't you heard (What ev'ry Corner of the Court resounds) That little Thumb will be a great Man made. Griz. I heard it, I confess—for who, alas! Grizzle was not probably possessed of that Glew, of which Mr. Banks speaks in his Cyrus. I'll glew my Ears to ev'ry word. Can always stop his Ears—but wou'd my Teeth, By grinding Knives, had first been set on Edge. Queen. Would I had heard at the still Noon of Night, The Hallaloo of Fire in every Street! Odsbobs! I have a mind to hang my self, To think I shou'd a Grandmother be made By such a Raskal.—Sure the King forgets, When in a Pudding, by his Mother put, The Bastard, by a Tinker, on a Stile Was drop'd.—O, good Lord Grizzle! can I bear To see him from a Pudding, mount the Throne? Or can, Oh can! my Huncamunca bear, To take a Pudding's Offspring to her Arms? Griz. Oh Horror! Horror! Horror! cease my Queen, Screech-Owls, dark Ravens and amphibious Monsters, Are screaming in that Voice. Mary Q. of Scots. Thy Voice like twenty Screech-Owls, wracks my Brain. Queen. Then rouse thy Spirit—we may yet prevent This hated Match.— Griz. —We will The Reader may see all the Beauties of this Speech in a late Ode called the Naval Lyrick. not Fate it self, Should it conspire with Thomas Thumb, should cause it. I'll swim through Seas; I'll ride upon the Clouds; I'll dig the Earth; I'll blow out ev'ry Fire; I'll rave; I'll rant; I'll rise; I'll rush; I'll roar; Fierce as the Man whom This Epithet to a Dolphin doth not give one so clear an Idea as were to be wished, a smiling Fish seeming a little more difficult to be imagined than a flying Fish. Mr. Dryden is of Opinion, that smiling is the Property of Reason, and that no irrational Creature can smile. Smiles not allowed to Beasts from Reason move. State of Innocence. smiling Dolphins bore, From the Prosaick to Poetick Shore. I'll tear the Scoundrel into twenty Pieces. Queen. Oh, no! prevent the Match, but hurt him not; For, tho' I would not have him have my Daughter, Yet can we kill the Man that kill'd the Giants? Griz. I tell you, Madam, it was all a Trick, He made the Giants first, and then he kill'd them; As Fox-hunters bring Foxes to the Wood, And then with Hounds they drive them out again. Queen. How! have you seen no Giants? Are there not Now, in the Yard, ten thousand proper Giants? Griz. These Lines are written in the same Key with those in the Earl of Essex; Why sayst thou so, I love thee well, indeed I do, and thou shalt find by this, 'tis true. Or with this in Cyrus; The most heroick Mind that ever was. And with above half of the modern Tragedies. Indeed, I cannot positively tell, But firmly do believe there is not One. Queen. Hence! from my Sight! thou Traitor, hie away; By all my Stars! thou enviest Tom Thumb. Go, Sirrah! go, Aristotle in that excellent Work of his which is very justly stiled his Master-piece, earnestly recommends using the Terms of Art, however coarse or even indecent they may be. Mr. Tate is of the same Opinion. Bru. Do not, like young Hawks, fetch a Course about, Your Game flies fair. Fra. Do not fear it. He answers you in your own Hawking Phrase. Injur'd Love. I think these two great Authorities are sufficient to justify Dollalolla in the use of the Phrase—Hie away hie; when in the same Line she says she is speaking to a setting Dog. hie away! hie!—thou art, A setting Dog be gone. Griz. Madam, I go. Tom Thumb shall feel the Vengeance you have rais'd: So, when two Dogs are fighting in the Streets, With a third Dog, one of the two Dogs meets, With angry Teeth, he bites him to the Bone, And this Dog smarts for what that Dog had done. SCENE VI. Queen sola. And whither shall I go?—Alack-a-day! I love Tom Thumb—but must not tell him so; For what's a Woman, when her Virtue's gone? A Coat without its Lace; Wig out of Buckle; A Stocking with a Hole in't—I can't live Without my Virtue, or without Tom Thumb. We meet with such another Pair of Scales in Dryden's King Arthur. Arthur and Oswald and their different Fates, Are weighing now within the Scales of Heav'n. Also in Sebastian. This Hour my Lot is weighing in the Scales. Then let me weigh them in two equal Scales, In this Scale put my Virtue, that, Tom Thumb. Alas! Tom Thumb is heavier than my Virtue. But hold!—perhaps I may be left a Widow: This Match prevented, then Tom Thumb is mine: In that dear Hope, I will forget my Pain. So, when some Wench to Tothill-Bridewell's sent, With beating Hemp, and Flogging she's content: She hopes in time to ease her present Pain, At length is free, and walks the Streets again. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE The Street. Bailiff, Follower. Bail. Come on, my trusty Follower, come on, This Day discharge thy Duty, and at Night A Double Mug of Beer, and Beer shall glad thee. Stand here by me, this Way must Noodle pass. Follow. No more, no more, Oh Bailiff! every Word Inspires my Soul with Virtue.—Oh! I long To meet the Enemy in the Street—and nab him; To lay arresting Hands upon his Back, And drag him trembling to the Spunging-House. Bail. There, when I have him, I will spunge upon him. Mr. Rowe is generally imagin'd to have taken some Hints from this Scene in his Character of Bajazet; but as he, of all the Tragick Writers, bears the least Resemblance to our Author in his Diction, I am unwilling to imagine he would condescend to copy him in this Particular. Oh! glorious Thought! by the Sun, Moon, and Stars, I will enjoy it, tho it be in Thought! Yes, yes, my Follower, I will enjoy it. Follow. Enjoy it then some other time, for now Our Prey approaches. Bail. Let us retire. SCENE II. Tom Thumb, Noodle, Bailiff, Follower. Thumb. Trust me my Noodle, I am wondrous sick; For tho' I love the gentle Huncamunca, Yet at the Thought of Marriage, I grow pale; For Oh!— This Method of surprizing an Audience by raising their Expectation to the highest Pitch, and then baulking it, hath been practis'd with great Success by most of our Tragical Authors. but swear thoul't keep it ever secret, I will unfold a Tale will make thee stare. Nood. I swear by lovely Huncamunca's Charms. Thumb. Then know— Almeyda in Sebastian is in the same Distress; Sometimes methinks I hear the Groan of Ghosts, Thin hollow Sounds and lamentable Screams; Then, like a dying Echo from afar, My Mother's Voice that cries, wed not Almeyda Forewarn'd, Almeyda, Marriage is thy Crime. my Grand-mamma hath often said, Tom Thumb, beware of Marriage. Nood. Sir, I blush To think a Warrior great in Arms as you, Should be affrighted by his Grand-mamma; Can an old Woman's empty Dreams deter The blooming Hero from the Virgin's Arms? Think of the Joy that will your Soul alarm, When in her fond Embraces clasp'd you lie, While on her panting Breast dissolv'd in Bliss, You pour out all Tom Thumb in every Kiss. Thumb. Oh! Noodle, thou hast fir'd my eager Soul; Spight of my Grandmother, she shall be mine; I'll hug, caress, I'll eat her up with Love. Whole Days, and Nights, and Years shall be too short For our Enjoyment, every Sun shall rise As very well he may if he hath any Modesty in him, says Mr. D?s The Author of Busiris, is extremely zealous to prevent the Sun's blushing at any indecent Object; and therefore on all such Occasions he addresses himself to the Sun, and desires him to keep out of the way. Rise never more, O Sun! let Night prevail, Eternal Darkness close the World's wide Scene. Busiris. Sun hide thy Face and put the World in Mourning. Ibid. Mr. Banks makes the Sun perform the Office of Hymen; and therefore not likely to be disgusted at such a Sight; The Sun sets forth like a gay Brideman with you. Mary Q. of Scots. Blushing, to see us in our Bed together. Nood. Oh Sir! this Purpose of your Soul pursue. Bail. Oh, Sir! I have an Action against you. Nood. At whose Suit is it? Bail. At your Taylor's, Sir. Your Taylor put this Warrant in my Hands, And I arrest you, Sir, at his Commands. Thumb. Ha! Dogs! Arrest my Friend before my Face! Think you Tom Thumb will suffer this Disgrace! But let vain Cowards threaten by their Word, Tom Thumb shall shew his Anger by his Sword. [Kills the Bailiff and his Follower. Bail. Oh, I am slain! Follow. I am murthered also, And to the Shades, the dismal Shades below, My Bailiff's faithful Follower I go. Nood. Nourmahal sends the same Message to Heaven; For I would have you, when you upwards move, Speak kindly of us, to our Friends above. Aurengzebe. We find another to Hell, in the Persian Princess; Villain, get thee down To Hell, and tell them that the Frays begun. Go then to Hell, like Rascals as you are, And give our Service to the Bailiffs there. Thumb. Thus perish all the Bailiffs in the Land, Till Debtors at Noon-Day shall walk the Streets, And no one fear a Bailiff or his Writ. SCENE III. The Princess Huncamunca's Apartment. Huncamunca, Cleora, Mustacha. Hunc. Anthony gives the same Command in the same Words. Give me some Musick—see that it be sad. Cleora sings. [I.] 1 Cupid, ease a Love-sick Maid, Bring thy Quiver to her Aid; With equal Ardor wound the Swain: Beauty should never sigh in vain. II. 2 Let him feel the pleasing Smart, Drive thy Arrow thro' his Heart; When One you wound, you then destroy; When Both you kill, you kill with Joy. Hunc. Oh! Marius, Marius; wherefore art thou Marius? Otway's Marius. O, Tom Thumb! Tom Thumb! wherefore art thou Tom Thumb? Why had'st thou not been born of Royal Race? Why had not mighty Bantam been thy Father? Or else the King of Brentford, Old or New? Must. I am surpriz'd that your Highness can give your self a Moment's Uneasiness about that little insignificant Fellow, Nothing is more commom than these seeming Contradictions; such as, Haughty Weakness. Victim. Great small World. Noah's Flood. Tom Thumb the Great—One properer for a Play-thing, than a Husband.—Were he my Husband, his Horns should be as long as his Body.— If you had fallen in Love with a Grenadier, I should not have wonder'd at it—If you had fallen in Love with Something; but to fall in Love with Nothing! Hunc. Cease, my Mustacha, on thy Duty cease. The Zephyr, when in flowry Vales it plays, Is not so soft, so sweet as Thummy's Breath. The Dove is not so gentle to its Mate. Must. The Dove is every bit as proper for a Husband —Alas! Madam, there's not a Beau about the Court looks so little like a Man—He is a perfect Butterfly, a Thing without Substance, and almost without Shadow too. Hunc. This Rudeness is unseasonable, desist; Or, I shall think this Railing comes from Love. Tom Thumb's a Creature of that charming Form, That no one can abuse, unless they love him. Must. Madam, the King. SCENE IV. King Huncamunca. King. Let all but Huncamunca leave the Room. [Ex. Cleora, and Mustacha. Daughter, I have observ'd of late some Grief, Unusual in your Countenance—your Eyes, Lee hath improv'd this Metaphor. Dost thou not view Joy peeping from my Eyes, The Casements open'd wide to gaze on thee; So Rome's glad Citizens to Windows rise, When they some young Triumpher fain would see. Gloriana. That, like two open Windows, us'd to shew The lovely Beauty of the Rooms within, Have now two Blinds before them—What is the Cause? Say, have you not enough of Meat and Drink? We've giv'n strict Orders not to have you stinted. Hunc. Alas! my Lord, I value not my self, That once I eat two Fowls and half a Pig; Almahide hath the same Contempt for these Appetites; To eat and drink can no Perfection be. Conquest of Granada. The Earl of Essex is of a different Opinion, and seems to place the chief Happiness of a General therein. Were but Commanders half so well rewarded, Then they might eat. Banks's Earl of Essex. But if we may believe one, who knows more than either, the Devil himself; we shall find Eating to be an Affair of more moment than is generally imagined. Gods are immortal only by their Food. Lucifer in the State of Innocence. Small is that Praise; but oh! a Maid may want, What she can neither eat nor drink. King. What's that? Hunc. This Expression is enough of it self (says Mr. D?s) utterly to destroy the Character of Huncamunca; yet we find a Woman of no abandon'd Character in Dryden, adventuring farther and thus excusing her self; To speak our Wishes first, forbid it Pride, Forbid it Modesty: True, they forbid it, But Nature does not, when we are athirst, Or hungry, will imperious Nature stay, Nor eat, nor drink, before 'tis bid fall on. Cleomenes. Cassandra speaks before she is asked. Huncamunca afterwards. Cassandra speaks her Wishes to her Lover. Huncamunca only to her Father. O spare my Blushes; but I mean a Husband. King. If that be all, I have provided one, A Husband great in Arms, whose warlike Sword Streams with the yellow Blood of slaughter'd Giants. Whose Name in Terrâ Incognitâ is known, Whose Valour, Wisdom, Virtue make a Noise, Great as the Kettle-Drums of twenty Armies. Hunc. Whom does my Royal Father mean? King. Tom Thumb. Hunc. Is it possible? King. Ha! the Window-Blinds are gone, Her Eyes resistless Magick bear, Angels I see, and Gods are dancing there. Lee's Sophonisba. A Country Dance of Joy is in your Face, Your Eyes spit Fire, your Cheeks grow red as Beef. Hunc. O, there's a Magick-musick in that Sound, Enough to turn me into Beef indeed. Yes, I will own, since licens'd by your Word, I'll own Tom Thumb the Cause of all my Grief. For him I've sigh'd, I've wept, I've gnaw'd my Sheets. King. Oh! thou shalt gnaw thy tender Sheets no more, A Husband thou shalt have to mumble now. Hunc. Oh! happy Sound! henceforth, let no one tell, That Huncamunca shall lead Apes in Hell. Oh! I am over-joy'd! King. I see thou art. Mr. Dennis in that excellent Tragedy, call'd Liberty Asserted, which is thought to have given so great a Stroke to the late French King, hath frequent Imitations of this beautiful Speech of King Arthur; Conquest light'ning in his Eyes, and thund'ring in his Arm. Joy lighten'd in her Eyes. Joys like Light'ning dart along my Soul. Joy lightens in thy Eyes, and thunders from thy Brows; Transports, like Lightning, dart along thy Soul, As Small-shot thro' a Hedge. Hunc. Oh! say not small. King. This happy News shall on our Tongue ride Post, Our self will bear the happy News to Thumb. Yet think not, Daughter, that your powerful Charms Must still detain the Hero from his Arms; Various his Duty, various his Delight; Now is his Turn to kiss, and now to fight; And now to kiss again. So, mighty Jove with excessive Thund'ring tir'd above, Comes down for Ease, enjoys a Nymph, and then Mounts dreadful, and to Thund'ring goes again. Gloriana. Jove, When with excessive thund'ring tir'd above, Comes down to Earth, and takes a Bit—and then, Flies to his Trade of Thund'ring, back again. SCENE V. Grizzle, Huncamunca. Griz. This beautiful Line, which ought, says Mr. W? to be written in Gold, is imitated in the New Sophonisba; Oh! Sophonisba, Sophonisba, oh! Oh! Narva, Narva, oh! The Author of a Song call'd Duke upon Duke, hath improv'd it. Alas! O Nick, O Nick, alas! Where, by the help of a little false Spelling, you have two Meanings in the repeated Words. Oh Huncamunca, Huncamunca, oh, Thy pouting Breasts, like Kettle-Drums of Brass, Beat everlasting loud Alarms of Joy; As bright as Brass they are, and oh, as hard; Oh Huncamunca, Huncamunca! oh! Hunc. Ha! do'st thou know me, Princess as I am, Edith, in the Bloody Brother, speaks to her Lover in the same familiar Language. Your Grace is full of Game.That thus of me you dare to make your Game. Griz. Oh Huncamunca, well I know that you A Princess are, and a King's Daughter too. But Love no Meanness scorns, no Grandeur fears, Love often Lords into the Cellar bears, And bids the sturdy Porter come up Stairs. For what's too high for Love, or what's too low? Oh Huncamunca, Huncamunca, oh! Hunc. But granting all you say of Love were true, My Love, alas! is to another due! In vain to me, a Suitoring you come; For I'm already promis'd to Tom Thumb. Griz. And can my Princess such a Durgen wed, One fitter for your Pocket than your Bed! Advis'd by me, the worthless Baby shun, Or you will ne'er be brought to bed of one. Oh take me to thy Arms and never flinch, Who am a Man by Jupiter ev'ry Inch. Traverse the glitt'ring Chambers of the Sky, Born on a Cloud in view of Fate I'll lie, And press her Soul while Gods stand wishing by. Hannibal. Then while in Joys together lost we lie I'll press thy Soul while Gods stand wishing by. Hunc. If, Sir, what you insinuate you prove All Obstacles of Promise you remove; For all Engagements to a Man must fall, Whene'er that Man is prov'd no Man at all. Griz. Oh let him seek some Dwarf, some fairy Miss, Where no Joint-stool must lift him to the Kiss. But by the Stars and Glory, you appear Much fitter for a Prussian Grenadier; One Globe alone, on Atlas Shoulders rests, Two Globes are less than Huncamunca's Breasts: The Milky-way is not so white, that's flat, And sure thy Breasts are full as large as that. Hunc. Oh, Sir, so strong your Eloquence I find, It is impossible to be unkind. Griz. Ah! speak that o'er again, and let the Let the four Winds from distant Corners meet, And on their Wings first bear it into France; Then back again to Edina's proud Walls, Till Victim to the Sound th' aspiring City falls. Albion Queen. Sound From one Pole to another Pole rebound; The Earth and Sky, each be a Battledoor And keep the Sound, that Shuttlecock, up an Hour; To Doctors Commons, for a License I, Swift as an Arrow from a Bow will fly. Hunc. Oh no! lest some Disaster we should meet, 'Twere better to be marry'd at the Fleet. Griz. Forbid it, all ye Powers, a Princess should By that vile Place, contaminate her Blood; My quick Return shall to my Charmer prove, I travel on the I do not remember any Metaphors so frequent in the Tragick Poets as those borrow'd from Riding Post; The Gods and Opportunity ride Post. Hannibal. —Let's rush together, For Death rides Post. Duke of Guise. Destruction gallops to thy murther Post. Gloriana. Post-Horses of Love. Hunc. Those Post-Horses to me will seem too slow, Tho' they should fly swift as the Gods, when they Ride on behind that Post-Boy, Opportunity. SCENE VI. Tom Thumb, Huncamunca. Thumb. Where is my Princess, where's my Huncamunca? Where are those Eyes, those Cardmatches of Love, That This Image too very often occurs; ?Bright as when thy Eye 'First lighted up our Loves. Aurengzebe. This not a Crown alone lights up my Name. Busiris. Light up all with Love my waxen Soul? Where is that Face which artful Nature made. There is great Dissension among the Poets concerning the Method of making Man. One tells his Mistress that the Mold she was made in being lost, Heaven cannot form such another. Lucifer, in Dryden, gives a merry Description of his own Formation; Whom Heaven neglecting, made and scarce design'd, But threw me in for Number to the rest. State of Innocency. In one Place, the same Poet supposes Man to be made of Metal; I was form'd Of that coarse Metal, which when she was made, The Gods threw by for Rubbish. All for Love. In another, of Dough; When the Gods moulded up the Paste of Man, Some of their Clay was left upon their Hands, And so they made Egyptians. Cleomenes. In another of Clay; —Rubbish of remaining Clay. Sebastian. One makes the Soul of Wax; Her waxen Soul begins to melt apace. Anna Bullen. Another of Flint. Sure our two Souls have somewhere been acquainted In former Beings, or struck out together, One Spark to Africk flew, and one to Portugal. Sebastian. To omit the great Quantities of Iron, Brazen and Leaden Souls which are so plenty in modern Authors—I cannot omit the Dress of a Soul as we find it in Dryden; Souls shirted but with Air. King Arthur. Nor can I pass by a particular sort of Soul in a particular sort of Description, in the New Sophonisba. Ye mysterious Powers, —Whether thro' your gloomy Depths I wander, Or on the Mountains walk; give me the calm, The steady smiling Soul, where Wisdom sheds Eternal Sun-shine, and eternal Joy. In the same Moulds where Venus self was cast? Hunc. This Line Mr. Banks has plunder'd entire in his Anna Bullen. Oh! What is Musick to the Ear that's deaf, Or a Goose-Pye to him that has no taste? What are these Praises now to me, since I Am promis'd to another? Thumb. Ha! promis'd. Hunc. Too sure; it's written in the Book of Fate. Thumb. Good Heaven, the Book of Fate before me lay, But to tear out the Journal of that Day. Or if the Order of the World below, Will not the Gap of one whole Day allow, Give me that Minute when she made her Vow. Conquest of Granada. Then I will tear away the Leaf Wherein it's writ, or if Fate won't allow So large a Gap within its Journal-Book, I'll blot it out at least. SCENE VII. Glumdalca, Tom Thumb, Huncamunca. Glum. I know some of the Commentators have imagined, that Mr. Dryden, in the Altercative Scene between Cleopatra and Octavia, a Scene which Mr. Addison inveighs against with great Bitterness, is much beholden to our Author. How just this their Observation is, I will not presume to determine. I need not ask if you are Huncamunca, Your Brandy Nose proclaims— Hunc. I am a Princess; Nor need I ask who you are. Glum. A Giantess; The Queen of those who made and unmade Queens. Hunc. The Man, whose chief Ambition is to be My Sweetheart, hath destroy'd these mighty Giants. Glum. Your Sweetheart? do'st thou think the Man, who once Hath worn my easy Chains, will e'er wear thine? Hunc. Well may your Chains be easy, since if Fame Says true, they have been try'd on twenty Husbands. A cobling Poet indeed, says Mr. D. and yet I believe we may find as monstrous Images in the Tragick-Authors: I'll put down one; Untie your folded Thoughts, and let them dangle loose as a Bride's Hair. Injur'd Love. Which Lines seem to have as much Title to a Milliner's Shop, as our Author's to a Shoemaker's. The Glove or Boot, so many times pull'd on, May well sit easy on the Hand or Foot. Glum.

You'd give the best of Shoes within your Shop, To be but half so handsome. Hunc. —Since you come Mr. L? takes occasion in this Place to commend the great Care of our Author to preserve the Metre of Blank Verse, in which Shakespear, Johnson and Fletcher were so notoriously negligent; and the Moderns, in Imitation of our Author, so laudably observant; —Then does Your Majesty believe that he can be A Traitor! Earl of Essex. Every Page of Sophonisba gives us Instances of this Excellence. To that, I'll put my Beauty to the Test; Tom Thumb, I'm yours, if you with me will go. Glum. Oh! stay, Tom Thumb, and you alone shall fill That Bed where twenty Giants us'd to lie. Thumb. In the Balcony that o'er-hangs the Stage, I've seen a Whore two 'Prentices engage; One half a Crown does in in his Fingers hold, The other shews a little Piece of Gold; She the Half Guinea wisely does purloin, And leaves the larger and the baser Coin.

The World's four Winds were pent within my Carcass. Verba Tragica. Confusion, Horror, Murder, Guts and Death. SCENE VIII. King Glumdalca. King. This Speech hath been terribly maul'd by the Poets.Sure never was so sad a King as I, —My Life is worn to Rags. Not worth a Prince's wearing. Love Triumph. My Life is worn as ragged as a Coat A Beggar wears; a Prince should put it off, Must I beg the Pity of my Slave? Must a King beg! But Love's a greater King, A Tyrant, nay a Devil that possesses me. He tunes the Organ of my Voice and speaks, Unknown to me, within me. Sebastian. To love a Captive and a Giantess. Oh Love! Oh Love! how great a King art thou! My Tongue's thy Trumpet, and thou Trumpetest, Unknown to me, within me. When thou wer't form'd, Heaven did a Man begin; But a Brute Soul by chance was shuffled in. Aurengzebe. —I am a Multitude. oh Glumdalca! Heaven thee design'd a Giantess to make, But an Angelick Soul was shuffled in. Of walking Griefs. New Sophonisba. I am a Multitude of Walking Griefs, And only on her Lips the Balm is found, I will take thy Scorpion Blood, And lay it to my Grief till I have Ease. Anna Bullen: To spread a Plaister that might cure them all. Glum. What do I hear? King. What do I see? Glum. Oh! King. Ah! Glum. Our Author, who every where shews his great Penetration into human Nature, here outdoes himself: Where a less judicious Poet would have raised a long Scene of whining Love. He who understood the Passions better, and that so violent an Affection as this must be too big for Utterance, chooses rather to send his Characters off in this sullen and doleful manner: In which admirable Conduct he is imitated by the Author of the justly celebrated Eurydice. Dr. Young seems to point at this Violence of Passion; —Passion choaks Their Words, and they're the Statues of Despair. And Seneca tells us, Curæleves loquuntur, ingentes stupent. The Story of the Egyptian King in Herodotus is too well known to need to be inserted; I refer the more curious Reader to the excellent Montagne, who hath written an Essay on this Subject. Ah Wretched Queen! King. Oh! Wretched King! Glum. Ah! King. Oh! SCENE IX. Tom Thumb, Huncamunca, Parson. Parson. Happy's the Wooing, that's not long adoing; For if I guess aright, Tom Thumb this Night Shall give a Being to a New Tom Thumb. Thumb. It shall be my Endeavour so to do. Hunc. Oh! fie upon you, Sir, you make me blush. To part is Death— ? 'Tis Death to part. ? Ah. ? Oh. Don Carlos. Thumb. It is the Virgin's Sign, and suits you well: Nor know I whether. What am I, who or where, Busiris. I was I know not what, and am I know not how. Gloriana. I know not where, nor how, now what I am, To understand sufficiently the Beauty of this Passage, it will be necessary that we comprehend every Man to contain two Selfs. I shall not attempt to prove this from Philosophy, which the Poets make so plainly evident. One runs away from the other; Let me demand your Majesty? Why fly you from your self. Duke of Guise. In a 2d. One Self is a Guardian to the other; Leave me the Care of me. Conquest of Granada. Again, My self am to my self less near. Ibid. In the same, the first Self is proud of the second; I my self am proud of me. State of Innocence. In a 3d.

Banks. Assist me, Zulema, if thou would'st be The Friend thou seemest, assist me against me. Albion Queens. From all which it appears, that there are two Selfs; and therefore Tom Thumb's losing himself is no such Solecism as it hath been represented by Men, rather ambitious of Criticizing, than qualify'd to Criticize. I'm so transported, I have lost my self. Hunc. Forbid it, all ye Stars, for you're so small, That were you lost, you'd find your self no more. So the unhappy Sempstress once, they say, Her Needle in a Pottle, lost, of Hay; In vain she look'd, and look'd, and made her Moan, For ah, the Needle was for ever gone. Parson. Long may they live, and love, and propagate, Till the whole Land be peopled with Tom Thumbs. Mr. F? imagines this Parson to have been a Welsh one from his Simile. So when the Cheshire Cheese a Maggot breeds, Another and another still succeeds. By thousands, and ten thousands they increase, Till one continued Maggot fills the rotten Cheese. SCENE X. Noodle, and then Grizzle. Nood. Our Author hath been plunder'd here according to Custom; Great Nature break thy Chain that links together, The Fabrick of the World and make a Chaos, Like that within my Soul. Love Triumphant. —Startle Nature, unfix the Globe, And hurl it from its Axle-tree and Hinges. Albion Queens. The tott'ring Earth seems sliding off its Props Sure Nature means to break her solid Chain, Or else unfix the World, and in a Rage, To hurl it from its Axle-tree and Hinges; All things are so confus'd, the King's in Love, The Queen is drunk, the Princess married is. Griz. Oh! Noodle, hast thou Huncamunca seen? Nood. I've seen a Thousand Sights this day, where none Are by the wonderful Bitch herself outdone, The King, the Queen, and all the Court are Sights. Griz. D?n your delay, ye Torturers proceed, I will not bear one Word but Almahide. Conq. of Granada. D?n your Delay, you Trifler, are you drunk, ha? I will not hear one Word but Huncamunca. Nood. By this time she is married to Tom Thumb. Griz. Mr. Dryden hath imitated this in All for Love. My Huncamunca. Nood. Your Huncamunca. Tom Thumb's Huncamunca, every Man's Huncamunca. Griz. If this be true all Womankind are damn'd: Nood. If it be not, may I be so my self. Griz. See where she comes! I'll not believe a Word Against that Face, upon whose This Miltonick Stile abounds in the New Sophonisba. —And on her ample Brow Sat Majesty. ample Brow, Sits Innocence with Majesty Enthron'd.

What means my lovely Huncamunca? Hunc. Hum! Griz. Oh! Speak. Hunc. Hum! Griz. Ha! your every Word is Hum. Your ev'ry Answer, still so ends in that, You force me still to answer you Morat. Aurengzebe. You force me still to answer you Tom Thumb. Tom Thumb, I'm on the Rack, I'm in a Flame, Morat, Morat, Morat, you love the Name. Aurengzebe. Tom Thumb, Tom Thumb, Tom Thumb, you love the Name; So pleasing is that Sound, that were you dumb You still would find a Voice to cry Tom Thumb. Hunc. Oh! Be not hasty to proclaim my Doom, My ample Heart for more than one has Room, A Maid like me, Heaven form'd at least for two, Here is a Sentiment for the Virtuous Huncamunca (says Mr. D?s) and yet with the leave of this great Man, the Virtuous Panthea in Cyrus, hath an Heart every whit as Ample; For two I must confess are Gods to me, Which is my Abradatus first, and thee. Cyrus the Great. Nor is the Lady in Love Triumphant; more reserv'd, tho' not so intelligible; —I am so divided, That I grieve most for both, and love both most. I married him, and now I'll marry you. Griz. Ha! dost thou own thy Falshood to my Face? Think'st thou that I will share thy Husband's place, Since to that Office one cannot suffice, And since you scorn to dine one single Dish on, Go, get your Husband put into Commission, Commissioners to discharge, (ye Gods) it fine is, The duty of a Husband to your Highness; Yet think not long, I will my Rival bear, Or unreveng'd the slighted Willow wear; The gloomy, brooding Tempest now confin'd, Within the hollow Caverns of my Mind. In dreadful Whirl, shall rowl along the Coasts, Shall thin the Land of all the Men it boasts, A ridiculous Supposition to any one, who considers the great and extensive Largeness of Hell, says a Commentator: But not so to those who consider the great Expansion of immaterial Substance. Mr. Banks makes one Soul to be so expanded that Heaven could not contain it; The Heavens are all too narrow for her Soul. Virtue Betray'd. The Persian Princess hath a Passage not unlike the Author of this; We will send such Shoals of murther'd Slaves, Shall glut Hell's empty Regions. This threatens to fill Hell even tho' it were empty; Lord Grizzle only to fill up the Chinks, supposing the rest already full. And cram up ev'ry Chink of Hell with Ghosts. Mr. Addison is generally thought to have had this Simile in his Eye, when he wrote that beautiful one at the end of the third Act of his Cato.So have I seen, in some dark Winter's Day, A sudden Storm rush down the Sky's High-Way, Sweep thro' the Streets with terrible ding dong, Gush thro' the Spouts, and wash whole Crowds along. The crowded Shops, the thronging Vermin skreen, Together cram the Dirty and the Clean, And not one Shoe-Boy in the Street is seen. Hunc. Oh! fatal Rashness should his Fury slay, My hapless Bridegroom on his Wedding Day; I, who this Morn, of two chose which to wed, May go again this Night alone to Bed; This beautiful Simile is founded on a Proverb, which does Honour to the English Language; Between two Stools the Breech falls to the Ground. I am not so pleased with any written Remains of the Ancients, as with those little Aphorisms, which verbal Tradition hath delivered down to us, under the Title of Proverbs. It were to be wished that instead of filling their Pages with the fabulous Theology of the Pagans, our modern Poets would think it worth their while to enrich their Works with the Proverbial Sayings of their Ancestors. Mr. Dryden hath chronicl'd one in Heroick; Two ifs scarce make one Possibility. Conquest of Granada. My Lord Bacon is of Opinion, that whatever is known of Arts and Sciences might be proved to have lurked in the Proverbs of Solomon. I am of the same Opinion in relation to those above mention'd: At least I am confident that a more perfect System of Ethicks, as well as Oeconomy, might be compiled out of them, than is at present extant, either in the Works of the Antient Philosophers, or those more valuable, as more voluminous, ones of the modern Divines. So have I seen some wild unsettled Fool, Who had her Choice of this, and that Joint Stool; To give the Preference to either, loath And fondly coveting to sit on both: While the two Stools her Sitting Part confound, Between 'em both fall Squat upon the Ground. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE King Arthur's Palace. Of all the Particulars in which the modern Stage falls short of the ancient, there is none so much to be lamented, as the great Scarcity of Ghosts in the latter. Whence this proceeds, I will not presume to determine. Some are of opinion, that the Moderns are unequal to that sublime Language which a Ghost ought to speak. One says ludicrously, That Ghosts are out of Fashion; another, That they are properer for Comedy; forgetting, I suppose, that Aristotle hath told us, That a Ghost is the Soul of Tragedy; for so I render the ???? ? ????? ??? ?????????,, which M. Dacier, amongst others, hath mistaken; I suppose mis-led, by not understanding the Fabula of the Latins, which signifies a Ghost as well as a Fable. —Te premet nox, fabulæque Manes. Hor. Of all the Ghosts that have ever appeared on the Stage, a very learned and judicious foreign Critick, gives the Preference to this of our Author. These are his Words, speaking of this Tragedy; —Nec quidquam in illâ admirabilius quam Phasma quoddam horrendum, quod omnibus aliis Spectris, quibuscum scatet Anglorum Tragœdia, longè (pace D?isii V. Doctiss. dixeram) prætulerim. Ghost solus. Hail! ye black Horrors of Midnight's Midnoon! Ye Fairies, Goblins, Bats and Screech-Owls, Hail!

SCENE II. King, and Ghost. King. What Noise is this?—What Villain dares, At this dread Hour, with Feet and Voice prophane, Disturb our Royal Walls? Ghost. One who defies Thy empty Power to hurt him; Almanzor reasons in the same manner; —A Ghost I'll be, And from a Ghost, you know, no Place is free. Conq. of Granada. one who dares Walk in thy Bed-Chamber. King. Presumptuous Slave! Thou diest: Ghost. Threaten others with that Word, The Man who writ this wretched Pun (says Mr. D.) would have picked your Pocket: Which he proceeds to shew, not only bad in it self, but doubly so on so solemn an Occasion. And yet in that excellent Play of Liberty Asserted, we find something very much resembling a Pun in the Mouth of a Mistress, who is parting with the Lover she is fond of; Ul. Oh, mortal Woe! one Kiss, and then farewel. Irene. The Gods have given to others to farewel. O miserably must Irene fair. Agamemnon, in the Victim, is full as facetious on the most solemn Occasion, that of Sacrificing his Daughter; Yes, Daughter, yes; you will assist the Priest; Yes, you must offer up your—Vows for Greece. I am a Ghost, and am already dead. King. Ye Stars! 'tis well; were thy last Hour to come, This Moment had been it; I'll pull thee backwards by thy Shrowd to Light, Or else, I'll squeeze thee, like a Bladder, there, And make thee groan thy self away to Air. Conquest of Granada. Snatch me, ye Gods, this Moment into Nothing. Cyrus the Great. yet by thy Shrowd I'll pull thee backward, squeeze thee to a Bladder, 'Till thou dost groan thy Nothingness away. [Ghost retires. Thou fly'st! 'Tis well. So, art thou gone? Thou canst no Conquest boast, I thought what was the Courage of a Ghost. Conquest of Granada. King Arthur seems to be as brave a Fellow as Almanzor, who says most heroically, —In spight of Ghosts, I'll on. I thought what was the Courage of a Ghost! Yet, dare not, on thy Life—Why say I that, Since Life thou hast not?—Dare not walk again, Within these Walls, on pain of the Red-Sea. For, if henceforth I ever find thee here, As sure, sure as a Gun, I'll have thee laid— Ghost. Were the Red-Sea, a Sea of Holland's Gin, The Liquor (when alive) whose very Smell I did detest, did loath—yet for the Sake Of Thomas Thumb, I would be laid therein. King. Ha! said you? Ghost. Yes, my Liege, I said Tom Thumb, Whose Father's Ghost I am—once not unknown To mighty Arthur. But, I see, 'tis true, The dearest Friend, when dead, we all forget. King. 'Tis he, it is the honest Gaffer Thumb. Oh! let me press thee in my eager Arms, Thou best of Ghosts! Thou something more than Ghost! Ghost. Would I were Something more, that we again Might feel each other in the warm Embrace. But now I have th' Advantage of my King, The Ghost of Lausaria in Cyrus is a plain Copy of this, and is therefore worth reading. Ah, Cyrus! Thou may'st as well grasp Water, or fleet Air, As think of touching my immortal Shade. Cyrus the Great. For I feel thee, whilst thou dost not feel me. King. But say, Thou better Part of heavenly Air. Conquest of Granada. thou dearest Air, Oh! say, what Dread, Important Business sends thee back to Earth? Ghost. Oh! then prepare to hear—which, but to hear, Is full enough to send thy Spirit hence. Thy Subjects up in Arms, by Grizzle led, Will, ere the rosy finger'd Morn shall ope The Shutters of the Sky, before the Gate Of this thy Royal Palace, swarming spread: A String of Similies (says one) proper to be hung up in the Cabinet of a Prince.

King. D?n all thou'st seen!—Dost thou, beneath the Shape Of Gaffer Thumb, come hither to abuse me, With Similies to keep me on the Rack? Hence—or by all the Torments of thy Hell, This Passage hath been understood several different Ways by the Commentators. For my Part, I find it difficult to understand it at all. Mr. Dryden says, I have heard something how two Bodies meet, But how two Souls join, I know not. So that 'till the Body of a Spirit be better understood, it will be difficult to understand how it is possible to run him through it. I'll run thee thro' the Body, tho' thou'st none. Ghost. Arthur, beware; I must this Moment hence, Not frighted by your Voice, but by the Cocks; Arthur beware, beware, beware, beware! Strive to avert thy yet impending Fate; For if thou'rt kill'd To-day, To-morrow all thy Care will come too late. SCENE III. King solus. King. Oh! stay, and leave me not uncertain thus! And whilst thou tellest me what's like my Fate, Oh, teach me how I may avert it too! Curst be the Man who first a Simile made! Curst, ev'ry Bard who writes!—So have I seen Those whose Comparisons are just and true, And those who liken things not like at all.

I find There is no Power in Drams, to quiet Wives; Each Morn, as the returning Sun, they wake, And shine upon their Husbands. Queen. Think, Oh think! What a Surprize it must be to the Sun, Rising, to find the vanish'd World away. What less can be the wretched Wife's Surprize, When, stretching out her Arms to fold thee fast, She folds her useless Bolster in her Arms. Think well of this, think that, think every way. Sophonisba. Think, think on that—Oh! think, think well on that. I do remember also to have read These Quotations are more usual in the Comick, than in the Tragick Writers. In Dryden's Ovid's Metamorphosis, That Jove in Form inanimate did lie With beauteous Danae; and trust me, Love, This Distress (says Mr.D?) I must allow to be extremely beautiful, and tends to heighten the virtuous Character of Dollallolla, who is so exceeding delicate, that she is in the highest Apprehension from the inanimate Embrace of a Bolster. An Example worthy of Imitation from all our Writers of Tragedy. I fear'd the Bolster might have been a Jove. King. Come to my Arms, most virtuous of thy Sex; Oh Dollallolla! were all Wives like thee, So many Husbands never had worn Horns. Should Huncamunca of thy Worth partake, Tom Thumb indeed were blest.—Oh fatal Name! For didst thou know one Quarter what I know, Then would'st thou know—Alas! what thou would'st know! Queen. What can I gather hence? Why dost thou speak Like Men who carry Raree-Shows about, Now you shall see, Gentlemen, what you shall see? O tell me more, or thou hast told too much. SCENE V. King, Queen, Noodle. Noodle. Long Life attend your Majesties serene, Great Arthur, King, and Dollallolla, Queen!

SCENE VI. King, Queen, Huncamunca, Noodle. King. See where the Princess comes! Where is Tom Thumb? Hunc. Oh! Sir, about an Hour and half ago He fallied out to encounter with the Foe, And swore, unless his Fate had him mis-led, From Grizzle's Shoulders to cut off his Head, And serve't up with your Chocolate in Bed. King. 'Tis well, I find one Devil told us both. Come, Dollallolla, Huncamunca, come, Within we'll wait for the victorious Thumb; In Peace and Safety we secure may stay, While to his Arm we trust the bloody Fray; Tho' Men and Giants should conspire with Gods, Credat Judæus Appelles Non ego—(Says Mr. D.)—For, passing over the Absurdity of being equal to Odds, can we possibly suppose a little insignificant Fellow—I say again, a little insignificant Fellow able to vie with a Strength which all the Sampsons and Hercules's of Antiquity would be unable to encounter. I shall refer this incredulous Critick to Mr. Dryden's Defence of his Almanzor; and lest that should not satisfy him, I shall quote a few Lines from the Speech of a much braver Fellow than Almanzor, Mr. Johnson's Achilles; Tho' Human Race rise in embattel'd Hosts, To force her from my Arms—Oh! Son of Atreus! By that immortal Pow'r, whose deathless Spirit Informs this Earth, I will oppose them all. Victim. He is alone equal to all these Odds. Queen. He is indeed, a I have heard of being supported by a Staff (says Mr. D.) but never of being supported by an Helmet. I believe he never heard of Sailing with Wings, which he may read in no less a Poet than Mr. Dryden; Unless we borrow Wings, and sail thro' Air. Love Triumphant. What will he say to a kneeling Valley? —I'll stand Like a safe Valley, that low bends the Knee, To some aspiring Mountain. Injur'd Love. I am asham'd of so ignorant a Carper, who doth not know that an Epithet in Tragedy is very often no other than an Expletive. Do not we read in the New Sophonisba of grinding Chains, blue Plagues, white Occasions, and blue Serenity? Nay, 'tis not the Adjective only, but sometimes half a Sentence is put by way of Expletive, as, Beauty pointed high with Spirit, in the same Play—and, In the Lap of Blessing, to be most curst. In the Revenge. Helmet to us all, While he supports, we need not fear to fall; His Arm dispatches all things to our Wish, And serves up every Foe's Head in a Dish.

Merl. Tom Thumb! Thumb. Again it calls. Merl. Tom Thumb! Glum. It calls again. Thumb. Appear, whoe'er thou art, I fear thee not. Merl. Thou hast no Cause to fear, I am thy Friend, Merlin by Name, a Conjuror by Trade, And to my Art thou dost thy Being owe. Thumb. How! Merl. Hear then the mystick Getting of Tom Thumb. See the History of Tom Thumb, pag. 2. His Father was a Ploughman plain, His Mother milk'd the Cow; And yet the way to get a Son, This Couple knew not how. Until such time the good old Man To learned Merlin goes, And there to him, in great Distress, In secret manner shows; How in his Heart he wish'd to have A Child, in time to come, To be his Heir, tho' it might be No biger than his Thumb: Of which old Merlin was foretold, That he his Wish should have; And so a Son of Stature small, The Charmer to him gave. Thou'st heard the past, look up and see the future. Thumb. —Amazement swallows up my Sense, And in th' impetuous Whirl of circling Fate, Drinks down my Reason. Pers. Princess. Lost in Amazement's Gulph, my Senses sink; See there, Glumdalca, see another —I have outfaced my self, What! am I two? Is there another Me? K. Arthur. Me! Glum. O Sight of Horror! see, you are devour'd By the expanded Jaws of a red Cow. Merl. Let not these Sights deter thy noble Mind, The Character of Merlin is wonderful throughout, but most so in this Prophetick Part. We find several of these Prophecies in the Tragick Authors, who frequently take this Opportunity to pay a Compliment to their Country, and sometimes to their Prince. None but our Author (who seems to have detested the least Appearance of Flattery) would have past by such an Opportunity of being a Political Prophet. For lo! a Sight more glorious courts thy Eyes; See from a far a Theatre arise; There, Ages yet unborn, shall Tribute pay To the Heroick Actions of this Day: Then Buskin Tragedy at length shall choose Thy Name the best Supporter of her Muse. Thumb. Enough, let every warlike Musick sound, We fall contented, if we fall renown'd. SCENE IX. Lord Grizzle, Foodle, Rebels, on one Side. Tom Thumb, Glumdalca, on the other. Food.

In both which Places it is intimated, that it is sometimes possible to see with other Eyes than your own. I hear them with my Ear, and see them with my Eye. Griz. Draw all your Swords, for Liberty we fight, This Mustard (says Mr. D.) is enough to turn one's Stomach: I would be glad to know what Idea the Author had in his Head when he wrote it. This will be, I believe, best explained by a Line of Mr. Dennis; And gave him Liberty, the Salt of Life. Liberty asserted. The Understanding that can digest the one, will not rise at the other. And Liberty the Mustard is of Life. Thumb. Are you the Man whom Men fam'd Grizzle name? Griz. Han. Are you the Chief, whom Men fam'd Scipio call? Scip. Are you the much more famous Hannibal? Hannib. Are you the much more fam'd Tom Thumb? Thumb. The same. Griz. Come on, our Worth upon our selves we'll prove, For Liberty I fight. Thumb. And I for Love. [A bloody Engagement between the two Armies here, Drums beating, Trumpets sounding, Thunder and Lightning.—They fight off and on several times. Some fall. Grizzle and Glumdalca remain. Glum.

Tom Thumb! Thumb. Rebel! Griz. Tom Thumb! Thumb. Hell! Griz. Huncamunca! Thumb. Thou hast it there. Griz. Too sure I feel it. Thumb. To Hell then, like a Rebel as you are, And give my Service to the Rebels there. Griz. Triumph not, Thumb, nor think thou shalt enjoy Thy Huncamunca undisturb'd, I'll send This last Speech of my Lord Grizzle, hath been of great Service to our Poets; —I'll hold it fast As Life, and when Life's gone, I'll hold this last; And if thou tak'st it from me when I'm slain, I'll send my Ghost, and fetch it back again. Conquest of Granada. My Ghost to fetch her to the other World; My Soul should with such Speed obey, It should not bait at Heaven to stop its way. Lee seems to have had this last in his Eye; 'Twas not my Purpose, Sir, to tarry there, I would but go to Heaven to take the Air. Gloriana. It shall but bait at Heaven, and then return. A rising Vapour rumbling in my Brains. Cleomenes. But, ha! I feel Death rumbling in my Brains, Some kind Spright knocks softly at my Soul, To tell me Fate's at Hand. Some kinder Spright knocks softly at my Soul. And gently whispers it to haste away: I come, I come, most willingly I come. Mr. Dryden seems to have had this Simile in his Eye, when he says, My Soul is packing up, and just on Wing. Conquest of Granada. So; when some City Wife, for Country Air, To Hampstead, or to Highgate does repair; Her, to make haste, her Husband does implore, And cries, My Dear, the Coach is at the Door. With equal Wish, desirous to be gone, She gets into the Coach, and then she cries—Drive on! Thumb. With those last Words And in a purple Vomit pour'd his Soul. Cleomenes. he vomited his Soul, Which, The Devil swallows vulgar Souls Like whipp'd Cream. Sebastian. like whipt Cream, the Devil will swallow down. Bear off the Body, and cut off the Head, Which I will to the King in Triumph lug; Rebellion's dead, and now I'll go to Breakfast. SCENE X. King, Queen, Huncamunca, and Courtiers. King. Open the Prisons, set the Wretched free, And bid our Treasurer disburse six Pounds To pay their Debts.—Let no one weep To-day. Come, Dollallolla; How I could curse my Name of Ptolemy! It is so long, it asks an Hour to write it. By Heav'n! I'll change it into Jove, or Mars, Or any other civil Monosyllable, That will not tire my Hand. Cleomenes. Curse that odious Name! It is so long, it asks an Hour to speak it. By Heavens! I'll change it into Doll, or Loll, Or any other civil Monosyllable That will not tire my Tongue.—Come, sit thee down, Here seated, let us view the Dancer's Sports; Bid 'em advance. This is the Wedding-Day Of Princess Huncamunca and Tom Thumb; Tom Thum! who wins two Victories Here is a visible Conjunction of two Days in one, by which our Author may have either intended an Emblem of a Wedding; or to insinuate, that Men in the Honey-Moon are apt to imagine Time shorter than it is. It brings into my Mind a Passage in the Comedy call'd the Coffee-House Politician; We will celebrate this Day at my House To-morrow. To-day, And this way marches, bearing Grizzle's Head. A Dance here. Nood. Oh! monstrous, dreadful, terrible, Oh! Oh! Deaf be my Ears, for ever blind, my Eyes! Dumb be my Tongue! Feet lame! All Senses lost! These beautiful Phrases are all to be found in one single Speech of King Arthur, or The British Worthy. Howl Wolves, grunt Bears, hiss Snakes, shriek all ye Ghosts! King. What does the Blockhead mean? Nood. I mean, my Liege I was but teaching him to grace his Tale With decent Horror. Cleomenes. Only to grace my Tale with decent Horror; Whilst from my Garret, twice two Stories high, I look'd abroad into the Streets below; I saw Tom Thumb attended by the Mob, Twice Twenty Shoe-Boys, twice two Dozen Links, Chairmen and Porters, Hackney-Coachmen, Whores; Aloft he bore the grizly Head of Grizzle; When of a sudden thro' the Streets there came A Cow, of larger than the usual Size, And in a Moment—guess, Oh! guess the rest! And in a Moment swallow'd up Tom Thumb. King. Shut up again the Prisons, bid my Treasurer Not give three Farthings out—hang all the Culprits, Guilty or not—no matter—Ravish Virgins, Go bid the Schoolmasters whip all their Boys; Let Lawyers, Parsons, and Physicians loose, To rob, impose on, and to kill the World. Nood. Her Majesty the Queen is in a Swoon. Queen. Not so much in a Swoon, but I have still Strength to reward the Messenger of ill News. [Kills Noodle. Nood. Oh! I am slain. Cle. My Lover's kill'd, I will revenge him so. [Kills the Queen. Hunc. My Mamma kill'd! vile Murtheress, beware. [Kills Cleora. Dood. This for an old Grudge, to thy Heart. [Kills Huncamunca. Must. And this I drive to thine, Oh Doodle! for a new one. [Kills Doodle. King. Ha! Murtheress vile, take that [Kills Must. We may say with Dryden, Death did at length so many Slain forget, And left the Tale, and took them by the Great. I know of no Tragedy which comes nearer to this charming and bloody Catastrophe, than Cleomenes, where the Curtain covers five principal Characters dead on the Stage. These Lines too, I ask no Questions then, of Who kill'd Who? The Bodies tell the Story as they lie. seem to have belonged more properly to this Scene of our Author. —Nor can I help imagining they were originally his. The Rival Ladies too seem beholden to this Scene; We're now a Chain of Lovers link'd in Death, Julia goes first, Gonsalvo hangs on her, And Angelina hangs upon Gonsalvo, As I on Angelina. No Scene, I believe, ever received greater Honours than this. It was applauded by several Encores, a Word very unusual in Tragedy—And it was very difficult for the Actors to escape without a second Slaughter. This I take to be a lively Assurance of that fierce Spirit of Liberty which remains among us, and which Mr. Dryden in his Essay on Dramatick Poetry hath observed—Whether Custom (says he) hath so insinuated it self into our Countrymen, or Nature hath so formed them to Fierceness, I know not, but they will scarcely suffer Combats, and other Objects of Horror, to be taken from them.—And indeed I am for having them encouraged in this Martial Disposition: Nor do I believe our Victories over the French have been owing to any thing more than to those bloody Spectacles daily exhibited in our Tragedies, of which the French Stage is so entirely clear. And take thou this. [Kills himself, and falls. So when the Child whom Nurse from Danger guards, Sends Jack for Mustard with a Pack of Cards; Kings, Queens and Knaves throw one another down, 'Till the whole Pack lies scatter'd and o'erthrown; So all our Pack upon the Floor is cast, And all I boast is—that I fall the last.
