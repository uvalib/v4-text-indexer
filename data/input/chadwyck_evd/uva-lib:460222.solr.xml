      <field name="fulltext">ZENOBIA: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Mrs. DANCER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE: Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND. Of old,âwhen Rome in a declining age Of lawless pow'r had felt the barb'rous rage, This was the tyrant's art:âHe gave a prize To him, who a new pleasure should devise. Ye tyrants of the Pit, whose cold disdain. Rejects and nauseates the repeated strain; Who call for rarities to quicken sense, Say, do you always the reward dispense? Ye bards,âto whom French wit gives kind relief, Are ye not oft the firstâto cry STOP THIEF! Say,âto a brother do you e're allow One little sprig, one leaf to deck his brow? No;âfierce invective stuns the play-wright's ears, Wits, Poets corner, Ledgers, Gazetteers? 'Tis said, the Tartar,âe're he pierce the heart, Inscribes his name upon his poison'd dart. That scheme's rejected by each scribbling spark; âOur Christian systemâstabs you in the dark. And yet the desp'rate author of to-night Dares on the muses wing another flight; Once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease, And feels th' ambitionâhere again to please. He brings a tale from a far distant age, Enobled by the grave historic page!? Tacitus Ann. Lib. 12. Sect. 44, to end of 51. Zenobia's woes have touch'd each polish'd state; The brightest eyes of France have mourn'd her fate. Harmonious Italy her tribute paid, And sung a dirge to her lamented shade. Yet think not that we mean to mock the eye With pilfer'd colours of a foreign dye. Not to translate our bard his pen doth dip; He takes a play, as Britons take a ship; They heave her down;âwith many a sturdy stroke, Repair her well, and build with Heart of Oak. To ev'ry breeze set Britain's streamers free, New-man her, and away again to sea. This is our author's aim;âand if his art Waken to sentiment the feeling heart; If in his scenes alternate passions burn, And friendship, love, guilt, virtue take their turn; If innocence oppress'd lie bleeding here, You'll giveâ'tis all he asksâone VIRTUOUS TEAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. PHARASMANES, Mr. AICKIN. RHADAMISTUS, Mr. BARRY. TERIBAZUS, Mr. HOLLAND. ZOPIRON, Mr. PACKER. TIGRANES, Mr. HURST. MEGISTUS, Mr. HAVARD. ZENOBIA, Mrs. DANCER. ZELMIRA, Mrs. BARRY. Attendants, Guards, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE lies in Pharasmanes' Camp, on the Banks of the Araxes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FIRST. Zelmira. Thro' the wide camp 'tis awful solitude! On ev'ry tent, which at the morning's dawn Rung with the din of arms, deep silence sits Adding new terrors to the dreadful scene! My heart dies in me!âhark!âwith hideous roar The turbulent Araxes foams along, And rolls his torrent thro' yon depth of woods! 'Tis terrible to hear!âwho's there?âZopiron! Enter Zopiron. Zelmira. My lord; my husband!âhelp me; lend your aid! Zopiron. Why didst thou leave thy tent?âwhy thus afflict Thy anxious breast, thou partner of my heart? Why wilt thou thus distract thy tender nature With groundless fearsâe're yonder sun shall visit The western sky, all will be hush'd to peace. Zelmira. The interval is horrid; big with woe, With consternation, peril and dismay! And oh! if here, while yet the fate of nations Suspended hangs upon the doubtful sword, If here the trembling heart thus shrink with horror, Here in these tents, in this unpeopled camp, Oh! think, Zopiron, in yon field of death Where numbers soon in purple heaps shall bleed, What feelings there must throb in ev'ry breast? How long, ambition, wilt thou stalk the earth And thus lay waste mankind!â Zopiron. This day at length The warlike king, victorious Pharasmanes Closes the scene of war.âThe Roman bands But ill can cope with the embattled numbers Asia pours forth, a firm undaunted host! A nation under arms!âand every bosom To deeds of glory fir'd!âIberia thenâ Zelmira. Perish Iberia!âmay the sons of Rome Pour rapid vengeance on her falling ranks, That he, who tramples on the rights of nature, May see his vassals over-whelm'd in ruin, May from yon field be led in sullen chains, To grace the triumph of imperial Rome, And from th' assembled senate humbly learn The dictates of humanity and justice! Zopiron. Thy generous zeal, thy ev'ry sentiment Charms my delighted soul.âBut thou be cautious, And check the rising ardor that inflames thee. The tyrant spares nor sex, nor innocenceâ Zelmira. Indignant of controul, he spurns each law, Each holy sanction, that restrains the nations, And forms 'twixt man and man the bond of peace. Zopiron. This is the tyger's den; with human gore For ever floats the pavement; with the shrieks Of matrons weeping o'er their slaughter'd sons, The cries of virgins to the brutal arms Of violation dragg'd, with ceaseless groans Of varied misery for ever rings The dreary region of his curs'd domain. Zelmira. To multiply his crimes, a beauteous captive, Th' afflicted Arianaâsheâfor her, For that fair excellence my bosom bleeds! She, in the prime of ev'ry blooming grace, When next the glowing hour of riot comes, Shall fall a victim to his base desiresâ Zopiron. The bounteous gods may succour virtue still! In this day's battle, which perhaps e're now The charging hosts have join'd, should Roman valour Prevail o'er Asia's numbers.â Zelmira. That event Is all our hope.âAnd lo! on yonder rampart Trembling with wild anxiety she stands, Invokes each god, and bids her straining eye Explore the distant field.â Zopiron. Yes, there she's fix'd A statue of despair!âThat tender bosom Heaves with no common griefâI've mark'd her oft, And if I read aright, some mighty cause Of hoarded anguish, some peculiar woe Preys on her mind unseen!âBut, ha! behold, She faints;âher fears too pow'rful for her frame Sink that frail beauty drooping to the earth. [Exit hastily. Zelmira. Haste, fly, Zopiron, fly with instant succour; Support her; help her;âLo! th' attendant train Have caught her in their arms!âassist her heav'n, Assuage the sorrows of that gentle spirit! Her flutt'ring sense returns;âand now this way The virgins lead her.âMay the avenging gods! In pity of the woes such virtue feels, In pity of the wrongs a world endures, With pow'r resistless arm the Roman legions, That they may hurl in one collected blowed Assur'd destruction on the tyrant's head!â Enter Zenobia, leaning on two attendants. Zenobia. A little onward, still a little onward Support my stepsâ Zelmira. How fares it, madam, now? Zenobia. My strength returnsâI thank ye, gen'rous maids, And would I could requite youâfruitless thanks Are all a wretch can give.â First attendant. The gentle office Of mild benevolence our nature promptsâ Your merit too commands:âon Ariana We tend with willing, with delighted care, And that delight o'er pays us for our trouble. Zenobia. Your cares for me denote a heart that feels For others woes.âMethinks with strength renew'd I could adventure forth again.â Second attendant. 'Twere best Repose your wearied spiritsâwe will seek Yon rising ground, and bring the swiftest tidings Of all the mingled tumult. Zenobia. Go, my virgins; Watch well each movement of the marshall'd field; Each turn of fortune;âlet me know it all;â Each varying circumstance.â Zenobia, Zelmira. Zelmira. And will you thus, Be doom'd for ever, Ariana, thus A willing prey to visionary ills, The self-consuming votarist of care? Zenobia. Alas! I'm doom'd to weepâthe wrath of heav'n With inexhausted vengeance follows still, And each day comes with aggravated woes. Zelmira. Yet when Iberia's king, when Pharasmanes, With all a lover's fondnessâ Zenobia. Name him not! Name not a monster horrible with blood, The widows, orphans, and the virgin's tears! Zelmira. Yet savage as he is, at sight of thee Each fiercer passion softens into love. To you he bends; the monarch of the east Dejected droops beneath your cold disdain, And all the tyranny of female pride. Zenobia. That pride is virtue;âvirtue that abhors The tyrant reeking from a brother's murder! Oh! Mithridates! ever honour'd shade! âPeaceful he reign'd, dispensing good around him, In the mild eve of honourable days!â Thro' all her peopled realm Armenia felt His equal sway;âthe sunset of his pow'r With fainter beams, but undiminish'd glory, Still shone serene, while ev'ry conscious subject With tears of praise beheld his calm decline, And bless'd the parting ray!âyet then, Zelmira, Oh! fact accurs'd!âyes Pharasmanes then, Detested perfidy!ânor ties of blood, Nor sacred laws, nor the just gods restrain him;â In the dead midnight hour the fell assassin Rush'd on the slumber of the virtuous man;â His life blood gush'd;âthe venerable king Wak'd, saw a brother arm'd against his life, âForgave him and expir'd! Zelmira. Yet wherefore open Afresh the wounds, which time long since hath clos'd? âThis Day confirms his sceptre in his hand. Zenobia. Confirms his sceptreâhis!âindignant gods, Will no red vengeance from your stores of wrath Burst down to crush the tyrant in his guilt? His sceptre, saidst thou?âurge that word no moreâ The sceptre of his son!âthe solemn right Of Rhadamistus!âMithridates' choice, That call'd him to his daughter's nuptial bed, Approv'd him lineal heir;âconsenting nobles, The public will, the sanction of the laws, All ratified his claim;âyet curs'd ambition, Deaf to a nation's voice, a nation's charter, Nor satisfied to fill Iberia's throne, Made war, unnatural war, against a son, Usurp'd his crown, and with remorseless rage Pursued his life. Zelmira. Can Ariana plead For such a son?âmeans she to varnish o'er The guilt of Rhadamistus? Zenobia. Guilt, Zelmira! Zelmira. Guilt that shoots horror thro' my aching heart!â Poor lost Zenobia! Zenobia. And do her misfortunes Awaken tender pity in your breast? Zelmira. Ill-fated princess! in her vernal bloom By a false husband murder'd!âfrom the stem A Rose-bud torn, and in some desert cave Thrown by to moulder into silent dust!â Zenobia. You knew not RhadamistusâPharasmanes Knew not the early virtues of his son. As yet an infant, in his tend'rest years His father sent him to Armenia's court, That Mithridates' care might form his mind To arts, to wisdom, and to manners worthy Armenia's sceptre, and Zenobia's love. The world delighted saw each dawning virtue, Each nameless grace to full perfection rising!â Oh! he was all the fondest maid could wish, All truth, all honour, tenderness and love! Yet from his empire thrown! with merciless fury His father following,âslaughter raging round, What could the hero in that dire extreme? Zelmira. Those strong impassion'd looks!âsome fatal secret Works in her heart, and melts her into tears. [Aside. Zenobia. Driv'n to the margin of Araxes' flood,â No means of flight,âaghast he look'd around,â Wild throbb'd his bosom with conflicting passions,â And must I then?âtears gush'd and choak'd his voice,â âAnd must I leave thee then Zenobia?âmust Thy beauteous formâhe paus'd, then aim'd a poniard At his great heartâbut oh! I rush'd upon him, And with these arms close-wreathing round his neck, With all the vehemence of pray'rs and shrieks, Implor'd the only boon he then could grant To perish with him in a fond embrace.â The foe drew nearâtime press'd,âno way was leftâ He clasp'd me to his heartâtogether both, Lock'd in the folds of love, we plung'd at once, And saught a requiem in the roaring flood. Zelmira. âThis wondrous taleâthis sudden burst of passionâ Zenobia. Ha!âwhither has my frenzy led me?âhark!â That sound of triumph!âlost, for ever lost! Ruin'd Armeniaâoh! devoted race! A flourish of trumpets. Enter Tigranes, Soldiers, and some Prisoners. Zenobia. Thy looks, Tigranes, indicate thy purpose! The armies met, and Pharasmanes conquer'd; Is it not so? Tigranes. As yet with pent up fury The soldier pants to let destruction loose. With eager speed we urg'd our rapid march, To where the Romans tented in the vale With cold delay protract the ling'ring war. At our approach their scanty numbers form Their feeble lines, the future prey of vengeance. Zenobia. And wherefore, when thy sword demands its share Of havock in that scene of blood and horror, Wherefore return'st thou to this lonely camp? Tigranes. With cautious eye as I explor'd the forest, Which rises thick near yonder ridge of mountains, And stretches o'er th' interminable plain, I saw these captives in the gloomy wood Seeking with silent march the Roman camp. Impal'd alive 'tis Pharasmanes' will They suffer death in misery of torment. Zenobia. Unhappy men!âand must theyâha!âthat face, That aged mien!âthat venerable form!â Immortal pow'rs!âis it my more than father?â âIs that Megistus?â Megistus. Ariana here! Gods! could I ever hope to see her more? Thou virtuous maid!âthou darling of my age!â Zenobia. It isâit is Megistus!âonce again Thus let me fall and clasp his rev'rend knee, Print the warm kiss of gratitude and love Upon this trembling hand, and pour the tears, The mingled tears of wonder and of joy.â Megistus. Rise, Ariana, riseâallmighty gods! The tide of joy and transport pours too fast Along these wither'd veinsâit is too much For a poor weak old man, worn out with grief And palsied age,âit is too much to bear! Oh! Ariana,âdaughter of affliction, Have I then found thee?âdo I thus behold thee!â Now I can die content!â Zenobia. Thou best of men! These joys our tears and looks can only speak.â Megistus. Yet they are cruel joysâmysterious heav'n! You bid the storm o'ercast our darksome ways; You gild the cloud with gleams of cheering light; Then comes a breath from you, and all is vanish'd! Zenobia. Wherefore dejected thusâ Megistus. Alas! to meet thee But for a moment, and then part for ever! To meet thee here, only to grieve thee more, To add to thy afflictions,âwound that bosom Where mild affection,âwhere each virtue dwells, Just to behold thee, and then close my eyes In endless night, while you survey my pangs In the approaching agony of tormentâ Zenobia. Talk not of agony;â'tis rapture all! And who has pow'r to tear thee from my heart? Megistus. Alas! the charge of vile imputed guiltâ Zenobia. I know thy truth, thy pure exalted mindâ Thy sense of noble deedsâimputed guiltâ Oh! none will dareâhast thou Tigranes?âwhat, What is his crime?âblush, foul traducer, blush!â Oh! (to Megistus) the wide world must own thy ev'ry virtue.â Tigranes. If in the conscious forest I beheld Their dark complottingsâ Zenobia. Peace, vile sland'rer, peace!â Thou know'st who captivates a monarch's heartâ 'Tis I protect himâAriana does it!â Thou, venerable man! in my pavillion I'll lodge thee safe from dangerâoh! this joy, This best supreme delight the gods have sent, In pity for whole years of countless woe. [Exit with Megistus. Zelmira, Tigranes. Tigranes. With what wild fury her conflicting passions Rise to a storm, a tempest of the soul! I know the latent causeâher heart revolts, And leagues in secret with the Roman arms. Zelmira. Beware Tigranes!âthat excess of joy, Those quick, those varied passions strongly speak The stranger has an int'rest in her heart. Besides, thou know'st o'er Pharasmanes' will She holds supreme dominionâ Tigranes. True, she rules him With boundless swayâ Zelmira. Nay, more to wake thy fearsâ The youthful prince, the valiant Teribazus In secret sighs, and feels the ray of beauty Through ev'ry sense soft-thrilling to his heart. He too becomes thy foe.â Tigranes. Unguarded man! Whate'er he loves or hates, with gen'rous warmth, As nature prompts, that dares he to avow, And lets each passion stand confess'd to view; Such too is Ariana;âbold and open She kindly gives instructions to her foe, To marr her best designs.â Zelmira. Her foe, Tigranes! That lovely form inshrines the gentlest virtues, Softest compassion, unaffected wisdom, To outward beauty lending higher charms Adorning and adorn'd!âThe gen'rous prince,â He tooâfull well thou know'st himâhe unites In the heroic mould of manly firmness, Each mild attractive artâoh! surely none Envy the fair renown that's earn'd by virtue. Tigranes. None should Zelmira!âha! those warlike notes! Enter Teribazus. Teribazus. Each weary soldier rest upon his arms, And wait the king's returnâZelmira say, In these dark moments of impending horror, How fares thy beauteous friend?âher tender spirit But ill supports the fierce alarms of war. Enter Zenobia. Zenobia. Where is he?âlet me flyâoh! Pharasmanesâ Methought those sounds bespoke the king's approachâ Oh! Teribazus, tell meâhave the fatesâ This horrible suspenseâ Teribazus. I came, bright maid, To hush the wild emotions of thy heart. Devouring slaughter for a while suspends It's ruthless rage;âas either host advanc'd In dread array, and from the burnish'd arms Of Asia's ranks redoubled sunbeams play'd Burning with bright diversities of day, Came forth an herald from the Roman camp With proferr'd termsâmy father deign'd for once To yield to mild persuasionâin his tent Th' ambassador of Rome will soon attend him To sheathe the sword, and give the nations peace. Zenobia. But oh! no peace for me, misfortune's heir! The wretched heir of misery!âBut now A more then father found,âyet cruel men Would tear him from meâgen'rous, gen'rous prince, Spare an old man, whose head is white with age, Nor let 'em wound me with the sharpest pang That ever tortur'd a poor bleeding heart. Teribazus. Arise my fair;âlet not a storm of grief Thus bend to earth my Ariana's beauties; Soon shall they all reviveâ Zenobia. They brought him fetter'd, Bound like a murderer!âTigranes,âhe,â This is the author of the horrid chargeâ He threatens instant deathâbut oh! protect, Protect an innocent, a good old man,â Or stretch me with him on the mournful bier. Teribazus. By heav'n, whoe'er he is, since dear to you, He shall not sufferâquick, direct me to himâ My guards shall safe inclose him. Zenobia. In my pavillion He waits his doomâ Teribazus. Myself will bear the tidings Of life, of joy, and liberty restor'd.â And thou artificer of ill, thou false, Thou vile defamer!âleave thy treach'rous arts, Nor dare accuse whom Ariana loves. Zenobia, Zelmira. Zenobia. Zelmira,âthis is happiness supreme! Oh! to have met with unexampl'd goodness To owe my all, my very life itself, To an unknown but hospitable hand, And thus enabled by the bounteous gods, To pay the vast, vast debtâ'tis ecstacy That swells above all bounds, till the fond heart Ache with delight, and thus run o'er in tears. Zelmira. What must Zelmira think?âat first your tongue Grew lavish in the praise of Rhadamistus, With hints obscure touching your high descent;â And now this hoary sageâis he your father? My mind is lost in wonder and in doubt.â Zenobia. Then to dispel thy doubts, and tell at once What deep reserve has hid within my heart, âI am ZenobiaâI that ill-starr'd wretch! The daughter of a scepter'd ancestry, And now the slave of Mithridates' brother! Zelmira. Long lost Zenobia, and restor'd at length! I am your subject; oh! my queen! my sov'reign! Zenobia. Thou gen'rous friend! rise, my Zelmira, rise. âThat good old man!âoh! it was he beheld me Borne far away from Rhadamistus' arms, Just perishing, just lost!â He dash'd into the flood, redeem'd me thence, And brought me back to life.âMy op'ning eyes Just saw the light, and clos'd again to shun it. Each vital pow'r was sunk, but he, well skill'd In potent herbs, recall'd my flutt'ring soul. Zelmira. May the propitious gods reward his care. Zenobia. With me he sav'd a dear, a precious boy, Then in the womb conceal'd;âhe sav'd my child To trace his father's lov'd resemblance to me, The dear, dear offspring of our bridal loves. Zelmira. Oh! blessings on him, blessings on his head!â Zenobia. Resign'd and patient I since dwelt with himâ Far in the mazes of a winding wood, Midst hoary mountains, and deep cavern'd rocks. But oh! the fond idea of my lord Pursued me still, or in the cavern'd rock, The mountain's brow, and pendent forest's gloom. The sun look'd joyless down;âeach lonely night Heard my griefs ecchoing thro' the woodland shade. âMy infant Rhadamistus!âhe is lost, He too is wrested from me!â'midst the rage And the wide waste of war, the hell-hound troops Of Pharasmanes sought my lone retreat, And from the violated shades, from all My soul held dear, the barb'rous ruffians tore me, And never shall the wretched mother see Her child again!â Zelmira. Heav'n may restore him still,â May still restore your royal husband tooâ Who knows but some protecting godâ Zenobia. No god! No guardian pow'r was present!âhe is lost!â Oh! Rhadamistus!âoh! my honour'd lord! No pitying eye beheld thy decent form;â The rolling flood devour'd thee!âthou hast found A watry grave, and the last dismal accents That trembled on thy tongue, came bubbling up, And murmur'd lost Zenobia! Zelmira. Yet be calm.â The gods may bring redressâeven now they give To misery like thine, the heartfelt joy Of shielding injured virtue. Zenobia. Yes, Zelmira, That pure delight is mine, a ray from heav'n That bids affliction smileâAll gracious pow'rs! Make me your agent here to save Megistus, I'll bear the load of life,âbear all its ills Till you shall bid this sad world-weary spirit To peaceful regions wing her happy flight, And seek my lord in the dark realms of night; Seek his dear shade in ev'ry pensive grove, And bear him all my constancy and love.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the SECOND. Tigranes. A false accuser deem'd!âartificer of fraud! Those words, intemp'rate boyâthy phrenzy too Deluded fair!âshall cost you dear attonement. Yet till occasion riseâthe king approaches. [Grand warlike music. A Military Procession: Enter Pharasmanes, &amp;c. Pharasmanes. At length the fame of Pharasmanes' arms Hath aw'd the nations roundâRome shrinks aghast With pale dismay, recalls her trembling legions, And deprecates the warâoh! what a scene Of glorious havoc had yon field beheld, If peaceful counsels had not check'd my fury! âValiant Tigranes, those rebellious slaves, Thy care detectedâhave they suffer'd death? Tigranes. Your pardon, Sirâtheir doom as yet suspendedâ The gen'rous princeâI would not utter aught Should injure Teribazusâ Pharasmanes. Ha!âproceed, And give me all the truthâ Tigranes. By his commandâ His tender nature deem'd it barb'rous rigour To urge their sentenceâ Pharasmanes. Vain aspiring boy! Tell Teribazus, [Enter Zenobia] âtell th' unthinking prince, The rash presumptuous stripling, these his arts, These practices of popular demeanour, Are treason to his fatherâlet him know Thro' wide Armenia and Iberia's realm My will is fateâthe slaves shall meet their doom. Zenobia. Oh! mighty king,âthus bending lowly down,â An humble suppliantâ Pharasmanes. Ariana here! Thou beauteous mourner, let no care molest Thy tender bosom;ârise and bid thy charms Beam forth thy gentlest lustre to adorn The glories of my triumph. Zenobia. Oh! a wretch like me It best befits thus groveling on the earth To bathe your feet with tearsâ Pharasmanes. It must not beâ [He raises her. By heav'n renown in arms in vain attends me, If the lov'd graces of thy matchless form Are thus depress'd and languish in affliction, Like flow'rs that droop and hang their pining heads Beneath the rigour of relentless skies, Zenobia. If thou would'st raise me from the depths of woe, Forgive those captives, whom thy fatal anger Adjudg'd to death, nor let ill-tim'd resentment Fall on the prince your sonâ'twas Iâmy tearsâ My piercing lamentations won his heart To arrest their doomâ Pharasmanes. For traitors to my crown Does Ariana plead?â Zenobia. For mild humanity My suppliant voice is rais'dâI point the means To add new glory to your fame in arms. In naught so near can men approach the gods As the dear act of giving life to others.â In feats of war the glory is divided, To all imparted,âto each common man,â And fortune too shall vindicate her share.â âBut of sweet mercy,âthe vast, vast renown Is all your own; nor officer, nor soldier Can claim a partâthe praise, the honour'd praise, Adorns the victor,ânor is th' eccho lost 'Midst shouts of armies, and the trumpet's sound. He conquers even victory itself, Than hero moreâa blessing to the world!â Pharasmanes. Thy eloquence disarms my stubborn soul. But wherefore urgent thus?âamidst the band Is there who claims thy soft solicitude? Zenobia. A hoary sageâalas! a more than fatherâ The best of menâpreserver of my being,â A blameless shepherd!ârude of fraud and guilt, Innoxious thro' his lifeâoh! mighty king, Spare an old man,âa venerable sire! Naught has your fortune greater than the pow'r To serve humanity!âshew that your heart Has the sweet grace, the gen'rous virtue too! Pharasmanes. My soul relents, and yields to thy entreaty, Thy violence of pray'rârelease him streightâ My brightest honours wait him;âhonours fit For him who gave thee birth;âfor him whose virtue Thy gen'rous soul deems worthy its esteem. Zenobia. Our humble station seeks nor pomp nor splendorâ We only ask, unenvied and obscure, To live in blameless innocence,âto seek Our calm retreat, embrac'd in depth of woods, And dwell with peace and humble virtue there. Pharasmanes. That cold disdain, which shuns admiring eyes, Attracts the more, exalting ev'ry charm. No more of humble birthâthy matchless beauty, Like gems, that in the mine conceal their lustre, Was form'd to dignify the eastern throne. My scepter, that strikes terror to each heart, Grac'd by thy decent hand shall make each subject Adore thy softer swayâThe glorious Ã¦ra Of Pharasmanes' love,âhis date of empire With Ariana shar'd, henceforth begins, And leads the laughing hoursâbut first the storm Of war and wild commotion must be hush'dâ That mighty care now calls me to my throne, To give the Roman audience; audience fit To strike a citizen of Rome with awe, When he beholds the majesty of kings. [going. Enter Teribazus. Teribazus. Dread Sir, the Roman embassy approaches.â From yonder rampart, that invests your camp, I heard their horses hoofs with eager speed Beat the resounding soil.â Pharasmanes. Let 'em approachâ And thou, whose arroganceâbut I forbearâ When Ariana pardons, my resentment Yields to her smiles, and looks away its rage. As when the crimes of men Jove's wrath demand, And the red thunder quivers in his hand; The queen of love his vengeance can disarm With the soft eloquence of ev'ry charm; Controul his passions with resistless sway, And the impending storm smile to serenest day. [Exit with his train. Zenobia, Teribazus. Teribazus. And may I then once more, thou bright perfection, May Teribazus once again approach thee, While thus my father,âmy ambitious father, At sight of thee forgets his cruel nature, And wonders how he feels thy beauty's pow'r? Oh! may Iâbut I'm too importunateâ Your looks rebuke me from you,âand I see How hateful I am grown!â Zenobia. Mistake me not Nor rashly thus arraign the looks of one, Whose heart lies bleeding hereâthy gen'rous worth Is oft the live-long day my fav'rite theme. But oh! for me,âfor wretched Ariana, The god of love long since hath quench'd his torch, And ev'ry source of joy lies dead within me. Teribazus. That cold averted look!âbut I am us'd To bear your scorn;âyour scorn that wounds the deeper, Mask'd as it is with pity and esteem. Yet love incurable,ârelentless love Burns here a constant flame, that rises still, And will to madness kindle, should I see That hoard of sweets, that treasury of charms Yield to another, to a barb'rous rival. Who persecutes a son to his undoing. Zenobia. If Ariana's happiness would wound thee, Thou'lt ne'er have cause to murmur or repine. Naught can divorce me from the black despair To which I've long been wedded.â Teribazus. Calm disdain, I grant you, well becomes the tyrant fair Whom Pharasmanes destines for his throne. But oh! in pity to this breaking heart, Give me, in mercy give some other rival, Whom I may stab,âwithout remorse may stab, 'Midst his delight, in all his heav'n of bliss, And spurn him from the joys, that scorpion-like Shoot anguish hereâhere thro' my very soul. Zenobia. Alas! too gen'rous prince, the gods long since Between us both fix'd their eternal bar. Teribazus. What say'st thou Ariana?âha! beware, Nor urge me to destractionâlove like mine, Fierce, gen'rous, wild,âwith disappointment wild, May rouse my desp'rate rage to do a deed Will make all nature shudder.âLove despis'd Not always can respect the ties of nature!â âDriven to extremes the tend'rest passion scorn'd May hate at length the object it adores, And stung to madnessâno!âinhuman fair, You still must be,âin all vicissitudes, In all the scenes misfortune has in store, You still must be the sov'reign of my soul. But for the favour'd, for the happy rival, By heav'n, whoe'er he be,âdespair and phrenzy May strike the blow, and dash him from your arms A sacrifice to violated love. Zenobia. Why thus distract yourself with vain suspicions? âYou have no rival, whom your rage can murderâ âNone in the pow'r of fateâoh! Teribazus, The wretched Arianaâlong, long sinceâ âMy heart sweels o'erâI cannot speakâa duty, A rigorous duty bids me ne'er accept Thy proferr'd love;âa duty, which, if known, Would in eternal silence seal thy vows, Turn all thy rage to tears, and, oh! my prince! Bid thee respect calamities like mine. [Exit. Teribazus. Yet Ariana stayâturn, turn and hear meâ She's gone, the cruel, unrelenting fair! And leaves me thus to misery of soul. Enter Zopiron. Flamminius, from the Romans is arriv'd, And bears the olive-branchâthe king your father Assembles all his noblesâ Teribazus. Say, Zopiron, Does Rome yield up Armenia? Zopiron. Rome is still The scourge of lawless pow'râa people's rights The conscript fathers have resolv'd to shield, And to the lineal heir assert the crown. Teribazus. May the stern god of battles aid their arms, And fight with the deliverers of mankind! Unnatural father! that would seize my scepter, Mine as my brother's heir, and ravish with it The idol of my soulâbut now no more His tyranny prevailsâto empire rais'd, 'Twill be the pride of my exulting heart, To lay my crown at Ariana's feet. [Exit. Zopiron. Unhappy prince! should Pharasmanes know His ardent passion for the captive maid, Alas! his fatal rageâpropitious pow'rs! May these events,âmay Rome's ambassador,â Oh! may he come with concord in his train, And far avert the ills my heart forebodes!â But lo! Flamminius.â Enter Rhadamistus. Zopiron. Welcome to these tents The harbinger of peace! Rhadamistus. Does your king know Flamminius waits his leisure? Zopiron. He prepares To hear you, Roman!â Rhadamistus. As I tread his camp There is I know not what of horror shoots Thro' all my frame, and disconcerted reason Suspends her function,âa black train of crimes, Murders, and lust, and rapine, cities sack'd, Nations laid waste by the destructive sword, A thousand ruthless deeds all rise to view, And shake my inmost soul, as I approach The author of calamity and ruin. Zopiron. Then from a Roman, from a son of freedom Let the fell tyrant hear the voice of truth, The strong resistless strain, which liberty Breathes in her capitol, till his proud heart Shudder with inward horror at itself. Rhadamistus. In Pharasmanes' camp that honest stile!â âThy visage bears the characters of virtue.â âWilt thou impart thy name and quality? Zopiron. In me you see Zopiron!âdeem me not A vile abettor of the tyrant's guilt.â To me Armenia trusts her sacred rights; Hither her chosen deligate she sends me, At the tribunal of Iberia's king, To plead her cause, an injur'd people's cause! Oh! never, never shall my native land Yield to a vile usurper. Rhadamistus. Rome has heard Thy patriot toil for freedomâRhadamistus Has heard thy gen'rous ardor in his cause, And pants to recompence thy truth and zeal. Zopiron. Oh! name not Rhadamistusânow no more The god-like youth shall bless Armenia's realm. The fates just shew'd him to the wond'ring world, And then untimely snatch'd him from our sight!â Rhadamistus. And didst thou know the prince? Zopiron. My lot severe Denied that transport;âbut the voice of fame Endears his memory. Rhadamistus. A time may come When you may meet, and both in friendship burn. âStill Rhadamistus lives!â Zopiron. Said'st thou Flamminius!â Lives he? Rhadamistus. Still he survives;âfrom death and peril Sav'd by a miracle!âand now for him Rome claims Armenia.â Zopiron. Claims Armenia for him!â For Rhadamistus claims!âand will ye, gods! Still will ye give him to a nation's pray'rs? Rhadamistus. Alas! he lives;âheart-broken, desolate, In sorrow plung'd,âabandon'd to despair!â Zopiron. The righteous gods will vindicate his cause.â His lov'd Zenobia, Mithridates' daughter, That ev'ry excellenceâdoes she too live? Have the indulgent pow'rs watch'd o'er her fate, And sav'd her for her people?â Rhadamistus. There, Zopiron, There lies the wound that pierces to his soul, The sharpest pang,âthat rendsâthat cleaves his heart. âOh! never more shall lovely lost Zenobia, That angel form, that pattern of all goodness, No, never moreâshe's gone, for ever gone!â Thou would'st not thinkâher barb'rous, cruel husbandâ With his own handâthe recollected tale Of horror shakes my frame to dissolution!â Her husband!âhe!âthat dear, that tender formâ Oh!âpoor Zenobiaâoh!â [Falls into a swoon. Zopiron. He faints;âhe falls!â Can Roman stoicism thus dissolve In tender pity?ârise, Flamminius, rise; He stirs; he breathes;âand life begins to wander O'er his forsaken cheek.âResume thy strength, And like a Roman triumph o'er your tears.â Rhadamistus. I'll not be forc'd back to a wretched world.â No;âlet me,âlet me die.â Zopiron. His eyes reject The cheerful lightâwhat can this anguish mean? Rhadamistus. You do but waste your pains;âit is in vain!â Away and leave a murd'rer to his woes.â Zopiron. Why thus accuse thyself?âI'll not believe itâ Thus let me raise thee from the earthâ Rhadamistus. Alas! (rising)â Despair weighs heavy on me. Zopiron. Still I must Controul this sudden phrenzyâ Rhadamistus. Oh!âZopiron, Here,âhere it liesâ Zopiron. Unburthen all, and ease Your loaded heartâit cannot beâthou never wert A murd'rer!â Rhadamistus. Yes!âthe horror of the world!â A murd'rous wretch!âthe fatal Rhadamistus!â 'Twas Iâthese felon hands!âwith treach'rous love I clasp'd her in this curs'd embraceâI bore her In these detested arms, and gave that beauty, That tender form to the devouring waves.â Plunge me, ye furies, in your lakes of fireâ Here fix,âfix all your vultures in my heart!â And lo! they rush upon me (starts up) see! see there! With racks and wheels they come;âthey tear me piece-mealâ 'Tis just Zenobia!âI deserve it allâ [Falls upon Zopiron. Zopiron. Assist him guardian pow'rs!âyour own high will Guides these events!ârevive, my prince, revive! Rhadamistus. Why thus recall me to despair and horror? To bid me hate the light, detest myself, Traitor to nature,âtraitor to my love!â âAnd yet, Zopiron,âyet I am not plung'd So far in guilt, but thou may'st pity me!â Heav'n, I attest,âyes you can witness gods! I meant to perish with herâbut the fates Denied that comfortâfrom her circling arms The torrent bore me farâexpiring, senseless, Gasping in death, the overflowing tide Impetuous drove me on th' unwish'd for shore. âThere soon deserted by the merciless stream A band of Romans, as from Syria's frontier They rang'd the country round,âdescried me stretch'd Pale and inanimateâwith barb'rous pity They lent their aid, and chain'd me to the rack Of inauspicious life!â Zopiron. For wond'rous ends Mysterious providence has still reserv'd you, To circulate the happiness of millions, A patriot princeâ Rhadamistus. Would they had let me perish!â What has a wretch like me to do in life, When my Zenobia's lost?â'tis true, my friend, She begg'd to dieâbut that pathetic look, Her tears, embraces, and those streaming eyes Still beauteous in distress!âeach winning grace, Her ev'ry charm should have forbid the deed, And pleaded for her life! Zopiron. And yet, my prince, When self-acquitting conscienceâ Rhadamistus. Self-condemn'd My soul is rack'd,âis tortur'dânot her child, Her unborn infant,âthe first fruit of love, Not ev'n her babe could with the voice of nature Plead for itself,âor for its wretched mother.â They perish'd both,âshe and her little one, And I survive to tell it.â Zopiron. Let not grief O'erwhelm your reason thusâwhat! when your father, Your cruel father, reeking from the blood Of Mithridatesâ Rhadamistus. Naught but death was left, Yet ev'n that last, sad refuge was debarr'd me!â E'er since I've liv'd in misery;âmy days Were colour'd all with anguish and despair! Long from the Romans I conceal'd my name. At length reveal'd me to a chosen friend;â âJourney'd with him to Rome; and in full senate Told all the dismal story of my woes. The conscript fathers heard, and dropt a tearâ Then to quick vengeance fir'd, dispatch'd their legions To wage the war; Paulinus leads them on, And now to me commits this embassy, With fully delegated pow'rs from Rome. Zopiron. With one united voice Armenia calls For Mithridates' heir!âconvinc'd by rumour That thou ar't lost, the gen'ral cry demands Your brother Teribazusâ Rhadamistus. He, Zopiron, Is to these eyes a stranger.â Zopiron. Hapless prince! A cloud of woes lies brooding o'er his head. A fair, a lovely captive rules his heart; Her name is Ariana; and indeed No wonder she attracts his soft regard, And kindles all the vehemence of love. The tyrant eyes her too with fierce desire,â And ruin nods o'er Teribazus' head. Rhadamistus. By heav'n it shall not beâalas! I know The pang of losing whom the heart adores.â I'll yield him up Armeniaâwhat are crowns But toys of vain ambition, when the lov'd The dear pertaker of my throne is lost? Enter Tigranes. Zopiron. What would Tigranes? Tigranes. Pharasmanes calls Flamminius to his presenceâ Rhadamistus. I attend him;â So tell your kingâ Tigranes. Instant he waits thee Roman. [Exit. Rhadamistus. How my heart trembles at the awful meeting! Zopiron. Then summon all your strengthâthe lapse of time From early youth, when Pharasmanes saw you, Affliction's inward stroke,âthat Roman garb, All will protect, and cloak you from detection!â Rhadamistus. Zopiron yes; in this important crisis, When violated laws, and injur'd men, When my own wrongs are lab'ring in my heart, The great occasion calls for firmest vigour. Yes, in this interview I will maintain A Roman's part;âin Pharasmanes' soul I'll wake the furies of detested guilt, And pour the rapid energy of truth Till ev'n to himself his crimes are known, And the usurper tremble on his throne.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the THIRD. Pharasmanes, on his Throne: Tigranes, Zopiron, Officers, &amp;c. Pharasmanes. Where is this bold republican from Rome? This enemy of kings?âTigranes, thou Bid the plebeian enterâPharasmanes Vouchsafes him audience.â Enter Flamminius. Pharasmanes. Now, Flamminius, say What motive brings you to Araxes' banks, To wage this slow, this philosophic war? Rhadamistus. By me, unworthy of th' important charge, By me, unequal to the arduous theme, The conscript fathers here explain their conduct, And justify the ways of Rome to kings. Pharasmanes. Roman, thou may'st declaim with all thy pomp Of idle eloquence. Rhadamistus. No pow'r of words, No graceful periods of harmonious speech Dwell on my lipâthe only art I boast Is honest truth, unpolish'd, unadorn'd!â Truth that must strike conviction to your heart, Truth that informs you,âto usurp a crown, For dire ambition to unpeople realms, Are violations of each sacred law, And bid the Roman eagle wing'd with vengeance To the Araxes' margin bend her flight, To tell destruction it shall rage no more. Pharasmanes. And dares Paulinus' soldier,âdar'st thou slave Thus offer vile indignity, and mouthe The language of your forum to a king? Rhadamistus. Rome knows, and owns you as Iberia's king, But not Armenia's.â Pharasmanes. Ha!â Rhadamistus. Th' assembled senate Acknowledges your vast renown in arms, And honours the unshaken fortitude Ev'n of a foeâbut, Sir, the fortitude, Whose brutal rage lays nations desolate, It is the glory of imperial Rome To humble and subdueâit is the glory Of Rome, that spares the vanquish'd, 'tis her pride To set the nations free;âto fix the bounds Of the fell tyrant's pow'r;âto trace the circle From which he must not moveâthese are the arts The bright prerogative of Romeâof Rome, The mistress of the world, whose conqu'ring banners O'er Asia's realms so oft have wav'd in triumph, And made ev'n kings her subjectsâ Pharasmanes. Ha! vain boaster! Rhadamistus. Made oriental kings, short by the knee Accept their crown, with tears of joy accept it, And be the viceroys of a Roman senate. Pharasmanes. And this to Pharasmanes?âhas not yet A train of conquest taught you to revere This good right arm in war?âThis arm the Parthians Have felt with fatal overthrowâno spoil, No trophies won from me have grac'd their triumphs; No friends of mine were harness'd to their chariots;â No captive chief, like your own mangled Crasius, There roams a sullen ghost, and calls for vengeance, For vengeance still unpaid, and calls in vain For the sad funeral rites.âWould Rome presume To wrest Armenia from me,âlo! my banners From frosty Caucasus to Phasis' banks Wave high in air, and shadow all the land. Call your embattled legionsâor does Rome, All conqu'ring Rome, that mistress of the world, Does she at length by her ambassadors Negotiate thus the war? Rhadamistus. Rome, Sir, commands The subject world, for she adores the godsâ And their all-pow'rful aid.â Pharasmanes. Would'st thou dispute My lawful claim,âarm thee with sword and fire, Not with vain subtleties, and idle maxims.â Armenia's crown is mine,âderiv'd to me, Heir to a brother, and a son deceas'd.â Rhadamistus. And can a murd'rer, can the midnight ruffian Prove himself heirâby the assassin's stab?â Pharasmanes. Thou base reviler!â [Comes forward and draws his saber. Tigranes. Moderate your fury; [holding him] It were unjustâ Zopiron. The character he bears,â The laws of nationsâ Pharasmanes. Thou base insolent! Who dar'st to wound the ear of sacred kings With a black crime, that's horrible to nature!â Rhadamistus. Yes horrible to nature!âyet the world Has heard it allâthou art the man of blood! A brother's blood yet smokes upon thy handâ Not his white age, his venerable looks, Not ev'n his godlike virtues could withhold thee!â Gash'd o'er with wounds he falls;âhe bleeds, he dies, Without a groan he dies!âthat is thy work, Thine, murd'rer, thine!â Pharasmanes. No moreâthe hand of heav'n Shook from the blasted tree the wither'd fruitâ Rhadamistus. Forbear the impious strainâit is the stile Ambition speaks, when for a crown it stabs, Then dares, with execrable mock'ry dares, Traduce the governing all-righteous mind. Pharasmanes. He harrows up my soul!âand do'st thou think A madman's ravingsâ Rhadamistus. Since that hour accurst Hast thou not plung'd thee deeper still in guilt? Your sonâyour blameless sonâ Pharasmanes. His crimes provok'd A father's wrathâhis and Zenobia's crimes!â Rhadamistus. She tooâuntimely lostâunbidden tears Forbear to stream, nor quite unman me thus. Pharasmanes. In tears!âby heav'n, thou woman-hearted slave, Those coward symptoms have some latent spring That lies conceal'd within that treach'rous heart. Rhadamistus. They are the tears humanity lets fall When soft ey'd beauty dies untimely slain.â But to avenge her death, array'd in terror The Roman legionsâ Pharasmanes. Lead 'em to the charge.â Thou quit my camp:âIf when yon sun descends Thou linger'st here, the title of ambassador Shall naught avail to save thee from my fury. Rhadamistus. E'er that resign ArmeniaâTill the close Of day, I give thee leisure to revolve The vengeance Rome preparesâThou know'st With what a pond'rous arm her hardy sons Lift the avenging spear.âBe timely wise, Nor dare provoke your fate. [Exit. Pharasmanes. Roman farewel!â Do thou, Tigranes, issue forth my orders From tent to tent, that each man stand prepar'd For the dead midnight hourâwith silent march Then will I pour with ruinous assault Upon th' astonish'd foe, my horses hoofs Imbrue in blood, and give to-morrow's sun A spectacle of horror and destruction.â [He ascends his throne, and the back scene closes. Enter Zenobia and Megistus. Zenobia. Oh! tell me all Megistus; let me hear All that concerns my child,âmy blooming boy, My little Rhadamistusâis he safe? Give me the truthâdo not deceive a mother Who doats upon her babeâis my child safe? Megistus. Dry up your tearsâI cannot bear to see you Afflicted thusâyour infant hero's safeâ You may believe your faithful old Megistusâ Zenobia. I do believe theeâbut excuse my weaknessâ My flutt'ring fears for ever paint him to me By ruffians seiz'd, and as he sees the knife Aim'd at his little throat, in vain imploring For me by name, and begging my assistance, While far, far off his miserable mother No aid can give, nor snatch him to her heart. Megistus. I never yet deceiv'd youâby yon heav'n The prince still livesâwhen I regain'd my cottage After the toils of many a weary day, I found him thereâbut griev'd and wond'ring much Where his dear mother was. Zenobia. Megistus tell me, Oh! tell me each particular; his looks, All his apt questions, his enchanting words; For I could hear of him for everâlovely youth! His father's image blooming in his boy! Thro' sev'n revolving years my only comfort!â âWhen from my eyes the sudden sorrows gush'd, How would he look, and ask his wretched mother What meant those falling tears?âalas! ev'n now I see him here before meâdid my child Think his poor mother lost? Megistus. At first he seem'd To pine in thought at your long weary absence, And many a look he cast, that plainly spoke His little bosom heav'd with various passions. Still would he seek you in each well known haunt, Each bow'r, each cavern, like the tender fawn That thro' the woodland seeks its mother lost, Exploring all around with anxious eye, And looking still unutterable grief, Lonely and sad, and stung with keen regret. Zenobia. Did my child weep?ânot much I hopeâ Megistus. With soothing tales I labour'd to beguile him from his sorrow;â I promis'd your return; a gentle smile Brighten'd his anxious look; he sigh'd content, And then I led him to a safer dwelling Among the shepherds of the Syrain vale, Who all have sworn to guard him as their own, And in due season lead him to the Romans. Zenobia. Oh! may those shepherds know the kindest influence Of the indulgent heav'ns!âyet why not stay To guard himâbut i'll not complainâon me Your cares were fix'dâoh! tell me how the gods Watch'd ov'r all thy ways, and brought thee to me? Where hast thou liv'd these many, many days?â Megistus. In bitterness of soul I've liv'd, thy fate Thy tender form deep imag'd in my breast! I rang'd the banks where the Arazes flows, But bring, alas! no tidings of your lord. Heart-broken, wearied out, I measur'd back My feeble steps,âbut thou wer't ravish'd thence;â For thee I travers'd hills and forests drear; Thee I invok'd, that ev'ry cavern'd rock, Each vale, each mountain eccho'd with thy name. Zenobia. And here at length you find me, here encompass'd With all the worst of illsâhence let us fly To the bless'd Syrian vally, where my child Wins with his early manhood ev'ry heart, And calls for me, and chides this long delay. Megistus. Vain the attemptâone only way is leftâ Reveal thee to th'ambassador of Rome.â Safe in his train thou may'st escape this place, And gain Paulinus' campâZenobia known Will meet protection there.â Zenobia. The gods inspire The happy counselâha!âTigranes comes! Retire Megistus (he goes out) a gay dawn of hope Beams forth at length, and lights up day within me. Zenobia, Tigranes. Tigranes. Hail princess, destin'd to imperial sway, To grace with beauty Pharasmanes' throne! By me the impatient king requests you'll fix The happy nuptial hour.â Zenobia. Thou might'st as well Command me wed the forked lightnings blaze That gilds the storm, and be in love with horror. Tigranes. Take heed, rash fair!âan eastern monarch's love, Ardent as his, must not be made the sport Of tyrant beautyâwhen a rival dares Oppose his sov'reign's wishâ Zenobia. Does Pharasmanes, Say,âdoes your king permit his spies of state, That curse of human kind, to breathe their whispers In his deluded ear? Tigranes. Full well 'tis know That Teribazus bids you thus revolt, And draws your heart's allegiance from your king. Zenobia. Thou vile accuser!âif the prince's virtues Have touch'd my bosom, what hast thou to urge? âWhat if a former Hymeneal vow Has bound my soul?âwhat if a father, Sir, A father dear as my heart's purple drops, Enjoin a rigid duty ne'er to share The throne of Mithridates with a murderer? Tigranes. Madam, those wordsâ Zenobia. Thou instrument of ill! Who still ar't ready with a tale suborn'd, And if thou ar't not perjur'd, dar'st betray;â Awayâand let thy conscience tell the rest. [Exit. Tigranes, alone. Vain haughty fair!âthou hast provok'd my rage By wrongs unnumber'dâbut for all those wrongs Soon shall inevitable ruin seize thee.â Enter Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus. Perhaps e're this your king's tumultuous passions Sink to a calm, and reason takes her turn. Then seek him, Sir, and bear a Roman's message, The terms of peace humanity suggests. Tell him Flamminius wishes to prevent The rage of slaughter, and the streams of blood Which else shall deluge yonder crimson plains. Tigranes. Already, Roman, his resolve is fix'd.â War, horrid war impends.â Rhadamistus. And yet in pity To human kind, to the unhappy millions Who soon shall die, and with their scatter'd bones Whiten the plains of Asia,âit were best To sheathe the sword, and join in Rome's alliance. Wilt thou convey my message? Tigranes. I obey.â [Exit. Rhadamistus, alone. May some propitious pow'r inspire his heart, And touch the springs of human kindness in him. Else against whom amidst the charging hosts Must Rhadamistus' sword be levell'd?âha!â Spite of his crimes he is my father stillâ And must this arm against the source of lifeâ Nay more,âperhaps against a brother too, âA brother still unknown!âhe too may die By this unconscious hand!âthis hand already Inur'd to murder whom my heart adores!â âMy brother then may bleed!âand when in death Gasping he lies, and pours his vital stream, Then in that moment shall the gen'rous youth Extend his arms, and with a piteous look Tell meâa brother doth forgive his murderer?â âGods! you have doom'd me to the blackest woe, To be a wretch abhorr'd, author of crimes From which my tortur'd breast revolts with horror!â âWho's there?âa youth comes forwardânow be firm, Be firm my heart, and guard thy fatal secret!â Enter Teribazus. Teribazus. Illustrious Roman,âif misfortune's son A wretched,âruin'dâmiserable prince May claim attentionâ Rhadamistus. Ha!âcan this be he! The graces of his youth,âeach feeling here, Here at my heartstrings tell me 'tis my brother! [aside. Teribazus. I see you're mov'd, and I intrude too far.â Rhadamistus. Pursue your purposeâwarmest friendship for you Glows in this breastâ Teribazus. Tho' Pharasmanes' fury Maintains a fix'd hostility with Rome, Blend not the son with all a father's crimes.â Rhadamistus. Go onâI pant to hearâ Teribazus. My father's cruelty Each day breaks out in some new act of horror, Nor lets the sword grow cool from human blood. First in his brother's breast he plung'd it;âthen Inflam'd to fiercer rage 'gainst his own son, Oh! Rhadamistus! thou much injur'd prince!â Rhadamistus. And didst thou love that brother? Teribazus. Gen'rous Roman, He liv'd far hence remoteâI ne'er beheld him, But the wide world resounded with his fame. Rhadamistus. Hold, hold my tears!âoh! they will burst their way At this his virtuous tenderness and love! [aside. Teribazus. And dost thou weep too Roman? Rhadamistus. From such horror, And so much cruelty my nature shrinks.â âWhatever purpose rolls within thy breast, Boldly confide itâshall I arm'd with vengeance Assault the purple tyrant in his camp? Or wilt thou join my steps;âthen in the front Of a brave vet'ran legion head the war, Seek the usurper 'midst his plumed troops, And thus avenge mankind? Teribazus. No; far from me, Far be the guilt of meditating aught Against the life frem whence my being sprung. Let him oppress me,âhe's a parent still!â Rhadamistus. He rives my heart!âoh! what a lot is mine! [aside. Teribazus. Not for myself I fear; but oh! Flamminius, A lovely captive,â'tis for her I tremble;â For Ariana,âfor that sweet perfection;â She is her sex's boast!âher gentle bosom Fraught with each excellence!âher form and feature Touch'd by the hand of elegance;âadorn'd By ev'ry grace, and cast in beauty's mould!â âHer Pharasmanes means to ravish from me.â But thou convey her henceâ'tis all I ask.â Rhadamistus. By heav'n I willâdo thou too join our flight; âArmenia shall be thine, and that sweet maid Reward thy goodness with connubial love, Adorn thy throne, and make a nation bless'd!â Teribazus. Make Ariana happy;âbear her hence And save those bright unviolated charms From Pharasmanes' pow'râwhen wish'd for peace Settles a jarring world, Flamminius then, Then will I seek thee.âWilt thou then resign her? Rhadamistus. Yes then, as pure as the unsullied snow That never felt a sunbeam;âthen I'll give her Back to thy faithful love. Teribazus. Thou gen'rous Roman, In gratitude I bowâshe's here at hand; A moment brings her to you, while at distance I watch each avenue, each winding path, That none intrude upon your privacy.â [Exit. Rhadamistus, alone. At length I've seen my brother;âknow how much He differs from his father!âhe shall seek The Roman tents;âI'll there disclose myself; There will embrace him with a brother's love.â Oh! how the tender transport heaves and swells, Till thus the fond excess disolves in tears!â Enter Megistus, leading Zenobia. Zenobia. Alas! my heart forebodes I know not whatâ Megistus. Dispel each doubtâthis is your only refuge.â Zenobia. Thou gen'rous Roman,âif distress like mineâ If an unhappy captive may approach theeâ Rhadamistus. To me affliction's voiceâye pow'rs of heav'n! That air!âthose features! that remember'd glance! Zenobia. If thus a wretch's presence can alarm youâ Rhadamistus. The music of that voice?âsuch once she look'd! And if I had not plung'd her in the stream,â I could persuade myselfâ Zenobia. Those well known accents! Those tender soft regards!ânay mock me not!â I could not hope to see theeâtell meâar't thouâ That once ador'd!âoh! (faints into Megistus' arms.) Megistus. Ah! her strength forsakes herâ Support her heav'n!â (catches her in his arms.) Rhadamistus. Ye wonder-working gods! Is this illusion all? or does your goodness Indeed restore her?âif I do not dream, If this be true,âoh! let those angel-eyes Open to life, to love, and Rhadamistus. Megistus. What further miracles doth heav'n prepare?â Zenobia. Forgive my weaknessâthe air-painted image Of my lov'd lordâand see!âagain it's present!â That look that speaks the fond impassion'd soul! Yes, such he was!âoh! ar't thouâtell meâsayâ Ar't thou restor'd me?âar't thou Rhadamistus?â Rhadamistus. I have not murder'd her!âbenignant gods! I am not guiltyâmy Zenobia lives!â Zenobia. It is my lordâoh! I can hold no longer,â But thus delighted spring to his embrace, Thus wander o'er him with my tears and kisses, And thus, and thus,âspeak my enraptur'd soul. Rhadamistus. She lives! she lives! what kind protecting god, Long lost, and long lamented, gives thee back, Gives me to view thee, and to hear thy voice With joy to ecstacy, with tears to rapture? Zenobia. This good old manâ'twas he preserv'd me for you.â Megistus. Oh! day of charms!âoh! unexpected hour! I have not liv'd in vainâthese gushing eyes Have seen their mutual transports!â Rhadamistus. Gen'rous friend, Come to my heart,âZenobia's second father!â Zenobia. Thou art indebted more than thou can'st pay him,â Indebted for our infant babe preserv'd, The blossom of our joys!âthou can'st not think How much he looks, and moves, and talks like thee.â Rhadamistus. Oh! mighty gods!âit is too much of bliss, Too exquisite to bear!âthese barb'rous hands Had well nigh murder'd both my wife and child!â âWilt thou forgive meâoh! my best delight, Wilt thou receive a traitor to your arms? âWilt thou Zenobia? Zenobia. Will I, gracious heav'n? Thou source of all my comfort!â Megistus. Ha! beware, Beware my prince!âbut now with hasty step I saw Tigranes circling yonder tent. Rhadamistus. Th' ambassador of Rome he seeks, on bus'ness Of import highâI will prevent his speedâ âAnd must I then so soon depart Zenobia? Zenobia. Hence, quickly henceâanon we'll meet againâ Rhadamistus. Yes, we will meet; the gods have giv'n thee to me, And they will finish their own holy work. [Exit. Megistus. My pray'rs are heard at lengthâZenobia still Shall be Armenia's queen.â Zenobia. Oh! good Megistus, Heav'n has been bounteous, and restor'd my lord.â With him I'll fly, wrapt in the gloom of night, And thou, Megistus, thou shal't join our flight; Plac'd near his throne thy gen'rous zeal shall share The bright reward of all thy toil and care; While I, redeem'd at length from fierce alarms, Forget my woes in Rhadamistus' arms. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FOURTH. Enter Rhadamistus, and Teribazus. Teribazus. Thou ar't a friend indeed, thou gen'rous man! The best of friends, to save such innocence, That lovely virgin bloom!âthe pious act Shall to remotest time transmit thy name, Ennobled by humanity and virtue. Rhadamistus. Alas! no praise I merit;â'tis a deed That loses virtue's nameâ Teribazus. Flamminius, no! Thou shalt not derogate from worth like thine. But oh! beware, my friend, and steel thy heart Against the sweet illapse of gentler passions. âTo love her were such treachery!âby heav'n! It were a fraud of a more damned hueâ A fraud to sacred friendship!âbut my soul Rejects the mean suspicionâthou ar't just, And Ariana shall be mine again!â Rhadamistus. If when the tumult of the war is pass'd, You then persist to claim herâ Teribazus. Then persist! âWhen I do not persist,âwhene'er my heart Forgets the fond ideaâha!âtake heedâ Your colour dies by fits,âand now again It flushes o'er your cheekâif beauty's pow'r Can waken soft desire,âand sure such beauty May warm the breast of stoic apathy,â If thou can'st love,âresign the trust at once. For oh! to lose her, to behold those charms, That all-perfection yielded to another, Were the worst agony, the keenest stab That ever pierc'd a lover to the soul.â The thought,âthe very thought inflames to madness!â Rhadamistus. (Aside) Not till the fever of his mind subsides, Must I reveal meâthe disclosure now Would to his phrenzy give a whirlwind's wing, And bury all in ruinâlet her then, Yes, Teribazus, let the blooming maid Still in this camp, a voluntary captive, âSince you will have it soâsince weak mistrust Can taint a noble spirit,âlet her here Teach that rare beauty to display its charms, Its various graces;âbid those radiant eyes Dart their quick glances to the tyrant's soul, Inflame his hot desires, and half absolve them. Teribazus. Madness and horror!âno!âhaste, fly, begone, And give her hence safe conductâI can trust To Roman continenceâyour Scipio's praise Shall be the theme of fame's eternal lip!â Rhadamistus. Thou too attend her steps;âwatch all her ways; When we have reach'd the Roman sanctuary, Then shall such wonders to thy list'ning ear,â The web which fate has woveâbeware my friendâ Tigranes comesâwhat would'st thou Sir? Enter Tigranes. Tigranes. The king Grants you one parley moreâev'n now this way He bends his stepsâremote from all he means To hold a private conf'renceâ Rhadamistus. Rome's ambassador Attends his pleasure.â [Exit Tigranes. Teribazus. I must hence, Flamminiusâ Farewel!âyet e're thou go'st,âI still must crave Another interviewâfarewel!âremember, My love, my life, my all depend on thee.â [Exit. Rhadamistus. Ah! luckless prince!âhow lost in error's maze Blindly he wanders, and love's sweet delusion Infuses it's enchantment through his heart! But when remov'd from Pharasmanes' pow'r He learns my prior claim,âhis gen'rous friendship Will bound with transport at a brother's joys, And with a warmth of sympathy partake 'em. But ha!âmy father!âgrant me strength, ye pow'rs! To meet the dread encounter.â Enter Pharasmanes. Pharasmanes. Once again E're you depart, if Pharasmanes deign To treat, and thus expostulate with Rome, 'Tis to thy pray'rs I grant it. Rhadamistus. Rome had rather Persuade than conquerâher well-ballanc'd justiceâ Pharasmanes. No more of Roman justiceâblazon not Virtues you ne'er have practis'dâwith the name, The specious name of love for human kind You sanctify th' insatiate rage of conquest, And where the sword has made a solitude, That you proclaim a peace.âEv'n now your views Stand manifest to sightâTo thee 'tis known That Rhadamistus lives!â Rhadamistus. How Sir!âcan heâ Does that unhappy princeâ Pharasmanes. Thou false dissembler!â Yes in thy heart the fatal secret's lodg'd!â Rhadamistus. Sir if your sonâif you will search his heartâ Pharasmanes. From certain fugitives I've learn'd it allâ In yonder camp, conceal'd from vulgar eyes, To war against his father still he lives!â Why dost thou droop dejected?âsomething lurks Beneath that burning blushâ Rhadamistus. That burning blush Glows on my cheek for theeâI know your son, And know him unsusceptible of guilt. Pharasmanes. Then, Roman, mark my wordsâwould'st thou prevent The carnage fate prepares on yonder plains?â Go tell Paulinus I will treat of terms With him, who brings me Rhadamistus' head. Rhadamistus. Your own son's head!â Pharasmanes. Why dost thou gaze so earnest? Why those emotions struggling for a vent? Rhadamistus. Amazement checks my voice, and lost in wonder I view the unnatural father, who would bathe His hands in blood,âin a son's bloodâa son Who pants,âwith ardor pants,âon terms of peace To sheathe the sword, and with a filial hand To throw a veil over a father's crimes. Pharasmanes. By heav'n 'tis falseâhas he not dar'd to league With my determin'd foes?âev'n to the senate, To ev'ry region, where his voice could pierce, Has he not fled with the delusive story? With grief and loud complaints inflam'd the world? And even now, does not the stripling come To the Araxes' banks with Rome in arms? Rhadamistus. Tho' urg'd by dire constraint, yet heav'n can witness His strong reluctance.â Pharasmanes. Let the rebel know He never shall ascend Armenia's throne. Rhadamistus. And shall destruction with her horrid train Stalk o'er the land?â Pharasmanes. Yesâlet destruction looseâ 'Tis Pharasmanes' gloryâ Rhadamistus. Can the rage, And the wild tumult of destructive havoc Administer delight?âalas!âthe day That deluges the land with human blood, Is that a day of glory?â I, Sir, have travers'd o'er the field of death, Where war had spent its rageâhadst thou beheld That scene of horror,âwhere unnumber'd wretches In mangled heaps lay welt'ring in their gore; Where the fond father in the gasp of death Wept for his children,âwhere the lover sigh'd For her, whom never more his eyes could view; Where various misery sent forth its groans;â Had'st thou beheld that scene,âthe touch of nature Had stirr'd within thee, and the virtuous drop Of pity gush'd unbidden from thy eye.â Pharasmanes. Enervate slave!âhere ends all further parleyâ Go tell your gen'ral, tell your Roman chiefs, The father claims his son.âHave we not heard How your own Brutus to the lictor's sword Condemn'd his children?âand would Rome dispute A king's paternal pow'r?âlet 'em yield up The treach'rous boy, or terrible in arms Shall Pharasmanes overwhelm their legions, Mow down their cohorts, and their mangled limbs Give to the vulture's beak. Rhadamistus. And yet reflectâ Pharasmanes. Roman no more.â Rhadamistus. Unwilling I withdraw;â A father's stern resolve the son shall mourn, And with a pang of nature shall behold The Roman eagle dart like thunder on thee. [Exit. Pharasmanes, alone. Away, and leave me slave!âto-morrow's sun Shall see my great revengeâmean time I give The gentle hours to love and Ariana.â What ho! Tigranes! Enter Tigranes. Pharasmanes. Does the stubborn fair Yield to my ardent vows? Tigranes. She mocks your passion, And gives to Teribazus all her smiles. Pharasmanes. By heav'n! ev'n love itself shall be my slave!â âYet love like mine requires her soft consent, And will not riot o'er her plunder'd charms.â âQuick, bring her father to meâ Tigranes. By your orders At hand Megistus waits your sov'reign will. [Exit. Pharasmanes. Bring him before usâwise and prudent age Will plead my cause, and second my desires. Enter Megistus. Megistus. Dread Sirâa blameless,âa distress'd old man, Of guilt unconsciousâ Pharasmanes. Whatsoe'er thy guilt A smile from Ariana expiates all. Megistus. Believe me, Sir, I never have offendedâ She was my sole delight; my age's comfort;â For her I felt more than a parent's loveâ But 'midst the troubles that distract the land I lost herâin despairâwith yearning heart I rang'd the country round in fond pursuitâ This is my crimeâsure 'tis no crime to love Such blooming innocence!â Pharasmanes. Dispel thy fearsâ Thy love for Ariana speaks thy virtueâ That graceful form, that symmetry of shape, That bloom, those features, those love-darting eyes, All, all attract, that there each fond admirer Could ever gaze, enamour'd of her charms. Megistus. Alas! whate'er the symmetry of shape, Whate'er the grace that revels in her feature, Glows in her bloom, or sparkles in her eye, They all are transient beauties, soon to fade, And leave inanimate that decent form. Inward affliction saps the vital frame, Incurable affliction!âfix'd in woe Her eyes for ever motionless and dim Gaze on the fancied image of her husband. Pharasmanes. Her husband! Megistus. Yes; a husband sever'd from her By fatal chance!âhim she for ever sees With fancy's gushing eye, and seeks him still In fond excursions of delusive thought. She pines each hour, and ev'n in blooming dies, As drooping roses,âwhile the worm unseen Preys on their fragrant sweets, still beauteous look, And waste their aromatic lives in air. Pharasmanes. The rose transplanted to a warmer sky. Shall raise its languid head, and all be well. Megistus. Her husband still survives, and far remote He wanders in Armenia's realmâ Pharasmanes. No more To call her his!âby all my promis'd joys His doom is fix'd!âdo thou streight seek thy daughter, My loveliest Arianaâin her ear Breathe the mild accents of a father's voice, And reconcile her heart to love and me. Megistus. Your pardon, Sir,âit were not fit my voice Should teach her to betray her holy vows. Pharasmanes. When Pharasmanes speaksâ Megistus. My life is his,â An when he wills it, 'tis devoted to himâ But, Sir, tho' poor,âmy honour still is mine, 'Tis all that heav'n has giv'n me,âand that gift The gods expect I never should resign. Pharasmanes. And do'st thou hesitate?âwhat, when a crown Invites thy daughter to imperial splendor? Megistus. Oh! not for me such splendor!âI have liv'd My humble days in virtuous poverty. To tend my flock, to watch each rising flow'r, Each herb, each plant that drinks the morning dew, And lift my praise to the just gods on high!â These were my habits, these my only cares;â âThese hands suffic'd to answer my desires, And having naught,âyet naught was wanting to me. Pharasmanes. Away, thou slave!âI would not quite despise theeâ Or yield your daughter, or my swiftest vengeance Falls on thy hoary headâa monarch's love Shall seize her trembling to his eager arms, Then spurn her back a prey to wan despair, Till bitter anguish blast each wither'd charm, And rave in vain for love and empire scorn'd!â [Exit. Megistus, alone. Fell monster go!âinexorable tyrant!â Perhaps I should have sooth'd his lion rage With feign'd complianceâha!âwhy sudden thusâ Enter Zenobia. Zenobia. Th' important hour, Megistus, now approachesâ Lo! the last blushes of departing day But feebly streak yon dim horizon's verge. My Rhadamistus comes to guide my stepsâ Thro' devious paths seek thou Zopiron's tentâ Thus we shall lull suspicionâ Megistus. I obey;â May guardian angels spread their wings around thee!â [Exit. Zenobia, alone: Yes, the bless'd gods, who thro' the maze of fate Have led us once again to meet in life, Will prove the friends of virtue to the last. âHa!âTeribazus comes!â Zenobia, Teribazus. Teribazus. And is it giv'n Once more to see thee here?âdo'st thou avoid me? Do'st thou despise me in this tender moment When my soul bleeds with anguish at the thought Of parting with thee?âAriana!â Zenobia. Oh!â Unhappy prince!âoh! fly me; shun me; death And ruin followâone short moment's stay Will rouze your father's rageâ Teribazus. My father's rage Already has undone meâah! in tears!â âAnd do they fall for me?âdoes that soft sigh Heave for the lost, afflicted Teribazus?â Zenobia. Yes the tear falls, and the sigh heaves for theeâ Thy elegance of mindâthe various graces That bloom around thee, and adorn the hero,â Nay, other ties there are which strongly plead, And bid me tremble for thee.â And yet,âsad recompense for all thy friendship, To warn thee hence,âto bid the shun my ways, Is all the gratitude I now can offer.â Teribazus. Thus must we part?â Zenobia. A rival is at hand,â Here in the camp,âan unexpected rival,â Sent by the gods,âthe idol of my soul! Teribazus. What say'st thou, Ariana?âhas another Usurp'd thy heart?âunkind, relentless maid!â Since first thy beauty dawn'd upon my sight, How have I lov'd,ârepented,âyet lov'd on!â Ev'n against you,âagainst myself I struggledâ Present I fled youâabsent I ador'dâ I fled for refuge to the forest's gloom,â But in the forest's gloom thy image met me!â The shades of night, the lustre of the day, All, all retrac'd my Ariana's form.â Thy form pursued me in the battle's rage, 'Midst shouts, and all the clangor of the war. âIt stole me from myself!âmy lonely tent Re-ecchoes with my groans, and in the ranks The wond'ring soldier hears my voice no more. Zenobia. Yet leave me Teribazusâgen'rous youth! Remembrance oft shall dwell upon thy praise, But for my love 'tis all another's claim. Teribazus. Another's claim!âwhy wilt thou torture thus A fond despairing wretch?âoh! not for me Those sorrows fallâthey are another's tears;â âAnother claims them from meâname this rival That my swift furyâtell me has Flamminius, Has the base Roman broke his promis'd faith? Will not the barb'rous man afford you shelter? Zenobia. Why wilt thou force me speak?âthe fate of all, Thine Teribazus,âmine,âthe fate of one, Whom, were he known,âthy heart holds ever dear, Is now concern'dâFlamminius claims my loveâ Long since he won my heartâ Teribazus. Vindictive gods! Flamminius claims thy love!ânot CÃ¦sar's self Shall dare to wrest thee from meâAriana!â Thus on my knees,âwould I could perish hereâ That ev'n in death I still might gaze upon thee, Till the last pang divide thee from my heart. Enter Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus. It was the voice of anguish and despair! Why thus illustrious princeâ Teribazus. (Starting up) Thou treach'rous Roman!â Who com'st to violate each sacred tie, The laws of honour, and the laws of love! Who com'st beneath the mask of public faith To do a robber's work!â Rhadamistus. When to your camp I bring a heart that longs to serve you, prince, Why this intemp'rate rage?â Teribazus. To do the work Of perfidy and fraud!âbut first by rapine, By violated maids your city grew;â And do you come to emulate your sires? Unwilling to degenerate in vice.â Rhadamistus. Mistaken youth!âoh! if you did but know me! If you but knew the justice Rome intendsâ Teribazus. Justice and Rome!âand dost thou dare to join Two names so opposite?âhave we not heard Of frugal consuls, and of stoic chiefs, Who soon forgetting here their sabine farms, Made war a trade, and then return'd to Rome Rich with the plunder of the rifled east? Again some new Lucullus leads them on, Fir'd with the love of rapine.â Rhadamistus. Fir'd with zeal To break a nation's chainsâwould'st thou but hear meâ âIt is a friend imploresâ Zenobia. A gen'rous friend!â Then listen to himâlet these streaming eyes, These earnest pray'rsâthis supplicating formâ Teribazus. Leagu'd with my foe behold her!âmighty gods!â Have I deserv'd it of her?â Rhadamistus. Yet be calmâ Yet listen to meâOh! I could unfoldâ Yet stayâI'll prove myself a brother to thee. Teribazus. Roman expect me in the battle's frontâ Instant depart,âbut leave thy prey behind;â Dare not,âI charge thee dare not, tempt her henceâ To-morrow's sun shall see me cloath'd in terror Pursue thy steps thro' all the ranks of war, Till my spear fix thee quiv'ring to the ground. [Exit. Rhadamistus, Zenobia. Zenobia. Yet, Rhadamistus, call himâlet him knowâ Rhadamistus. Thou lovely trembler!âbanish ev'ry fearâ The time now bids us henceâand lo! the moon Streams her mild radiance on the rustling grove.â âI will conduct theeâha! Zopironâ Enter Zopiron. Rhadamistus. Come Thou best of men, let me once more embrace thee.â Zopiron. Oh! speed thee henceâeach moment's big with deathâ Rhadamistus. Farewel! farewel! when I've escap'd your camp Seek thou my brother; soothe his troubled spirit, Explain these wonders;âtell him Rhadamistus Esteems and loves, and honours all his virtues.â Farewel Zopiron!âin Armenia's court Thy king shall thank thy goodnessâmy Zenobia, Oh! let me guide thee from this place of danger To life, to love, to liberty and joy. [Exit with Zenobia. Zopiron. Lo! the heav'ns smile with gentlest aspect on them!â This calm serene that ev'ry planet sheds To light their steps,âthis glad Ã¦therial mildness Is sure the token of incircling gods That hover anxious o'er the solemn scene!â Enter Pharasmanes, Tigranes following. Pharasmanes. Let Teribazus streight attend our presenceâ Tigranes. But now with glaring eye and fierce demeanour He enter'd yonder tentâ Pharasmanes. Bid him approach us.â Then do thou round the midnight watch, and see That Rome's ambassador has left my camp. [Exit Tigranes. This war, Zopiron, shall be soon extinguish'd In Roman blood, and yield Armenia to me. Zopiron. Armenia, Sir, still obstinately mourns Lost Mithridates, father of his people. Her hardy sons with one consenting voice Demand a king from Rome;âall leagu'd and sworn Never to crouch beneath the conqu'ror's yoke. Pharasmanes. But when the Roman eagle bites the ground, They'll shrink aghast, and own my sov'reign sway. Enter Teribazus. Pharasmanes. Thou base confed'rate with thy father's foes! Teribazus. The accusation, Sir,âif proof support it, Gives you my forfeit life, and I resign it, Freely resignâif destitute of proof, It is a stab to honour,âand the charge Should not be lightly urg'd.â Pharasmanes. This arrogance That dictates to a fatherâ Teribazus. 'Tis the spirit Of injur'd innocenceâif Pharasmanes Suspect my truth,âsend me where danger calls;â Bid me this moment carry death and slaughter To rage in yonder camp;âyes, then your son Shall mark his hatred of the Roman name. Pharasmanes. Hast thou not dar'd to thwart my tend'rest passion, And to seduce my Ariana's love? Teribazus. And if this youthful heart, too prone to melt At beauty's ray, receiv'd the gentle flame, 'Tis pastâthe charm is o'erâno longer now I walk a captive in her haughty triumph!â In vain she now may call forth all her graces, Instruct her eyes to roll with bidden fires, And practice all the wonders of her face. Ambition calls, and lights a nobler flame. Enter Tigranes. Tigranes. Th' ambassador of Rome, and that old traitor The false Megistusâ Pharasmanes. Speak; unfold thy purpose.â Tigranes. Together left the camp, and in their train Bear Ariana with themâ Teribazus. Ariana!â Have the slaves dar'dâdetested treachery! Now, now, my father, now approve my zeal. Pharasmanes. Haste, fly, pursue her; bring the trait'ress back!â Teribazus. My rapid vengeance shall o'ertake their flight; And bring the Roman plund'rer bound in chains. [Exit. Pharasmanes. Do thou, Tigranes, with a chosen band Circle yon hills, and intercept their march. And thou, Zopiron, send my swiftest horse To range the wood, and sweep along the vale. [Exit Tigranes. Zopiron. Ye guardian deities, now lend your aid. [Exit. Pharasmanes, alone. Has the perfidious,âyet ador'd deceiver, Thus has she left me?âfrom a monarch's smile Fled with a lawless ravager from Rome?â Oh! give me vengeance; give Flamminius to me, That he may die in agony unheard of.â The trait'ress then,âspite of each winning art,â Spite of her guiltâshe triumphs in my heart. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FIFTH. Pharasmanes. Not yet return'd!âI'm tortur'd on the rackâ By heav'n to-morrow's dawnâdistracting thought! E're that the Roman ravager enjoys Her heav'n of bliss, and riots in delight. My soul's on fireâthis night I'll storm his camp And dash his promis'd joys;âlet loose my rage, [A flourish of trumpets: And bury all in ruinâha!âwhat means This new alarm?â Enter Teribazus, Soldiers, &amp;c. Teribazus. The treach'rous slave is taken!â My speed outstripp'd him, and this arm that seiz'd Hath well secur'd the traitorâ Pharasmanes. Great revenge, The measure of thy joys is full!â Teribazus. At first They made a feeble stand;âbut hemm'd around And close incircled by the sons of Asia They saw death threat'ning at each javelin's point. I rush'd upon Flamminiusâmuch he courted A secret parley, but my soul disdain'd All further conf'renceâhe and his complotter The base Megistus, with the fair deserter Remeasure back their steps, and clank their chains In bitterness of heart.â Pharasmanes. A father's thanks, Shall well requite theeâlo! the traitors comeâ Enter Rhadamistus, Zenobia, Megistus, in Chains. Pharasmanes. Thou base perfidious!âthou Italian plunderer! Rhadamistus. I do not mean to wage a war of words.â Repent thee of this insult, of these chains On him, who represents a people here. Pharasmanes. Anon thou'lt see how I respect that people. My just revenge shall tell thee;âon thy head, And thine, Megistus, sudden vengeance falls. Megistus. Alas! worn out with age and misery I long to lay me in the shroud of death. Pharasmanes. I grant thy wishâwhat words, fair fugitive, Can colour thy deceit?â Zenobia. The heart resolv'd Wants no excuse, no colouring of wordsâ I found my husband,âflew to his embrace;â This,âthis is he!âthe lord of my desiresâ With him content I'll traverse o'er the world.â Pharasmanes. Do'st thou avow it too?â Zenobia. Do I avow it?â Yes, I exult, I glory in itâThink'st thou I'll prove so meanly false to honour's cause As to apologize for being faithful?â Teribazus. I see Flamminius has already school'd her In Roman maximsâ Rhadamistus. Miserable prince! I will not answer theeâtoo soon thy heart For this last feat will bitterly reproach thee!â Teribazus. Away with thy delusive artsâif ever I form alliance with haughty people, Those ravagers of earth,âif e'er again I hold communion with thee,âmay the godsâ May Pharasmanes,âbut it cannot beâ My heart high beating in my country's cause, Vows an eternal enmity with Rome. [Exit. Rhadamistus. Thee, Pharasmanes, thee my voice addressesâ Thou know'st my title to herâHymen's rites Long since united bothâThen loose these chains;â 'Tis in the name of Rome I ask itâ Pharasmanes. Slave!â Thy title, by the rights of war, is now extinguish'd.â Captivity dissolves her former ties, And now the laws of arms have made her mine. Zenobia. And are there laws to change the human heart? To alter the affections of the soul? Know that my heart is rul'd by other laws, The laws of truth, of honour, and of love. This is my husband! source of all my comfort! With him I'll liveâwith him will dare to die!â Pharasmanes. By heav'n some mysteryâthou treach'rous fair! Mark well my wordsâunfold thy birth and rankâ My mind uncertain wanders in conjectureâ Who and what ar't thou?âVain is ev'ry guessâ Resolve my doubts, or else the Roman's doom Shall be determin'd streightâ Zenobia. And my resolve, Tyrant, is fix'd to share my husband's fate. That I unfoldâthat sentiment revealâ To heav'n and earth reveal itâfor the rest Guess if you can,âdetermine if you dare. Pharasmanes. Quick, drag Flamminius henceâ Rhadamistus. Slaves, hold your handsâ My character protects me hereâ Pharasmanes. Dispatch, Instant dispatch, and seize Megistus tooâ [Megistus is led off. Zenobia. Horror!âcall back the wordâit shall not beâ Here will I hold himâbarb'rous ruffians holdâ Murder!âmy life! my lord! my husband! oh!â [Rhadamistus is dragg'd off. Pharasmanes. Give him the torture; let your keenest pangs Extort each secret from himâ Zenobia. Pharasmanes! Thus lowly humbled, prostrate in the dust, Washing your feet with tearsâhave mercy!âthis Will be the blackest, worst of all your murdersâ Pharasmanes. There's but one way to mitigate his doomâ Zenobia. Give me to know itâspare himâspare his lifeâ Pharasmanes. Abjure the slave, and by connubial vows This instant make thee partner of my throne. Zenobia. My faith, my love, my very life is hisâ My child is hisâoh! think thou see'st my infant Lifting his little handsâ Pharasmanes. I'll hear no moreâ Or yield this moment, or the traitor dies.

Inhuman Tyrant!âmadness seize my brainâ Swallow me earthâhere shall these desp'rate hands Strike on thy flinty bosom,âhere my voice Pierce to thy center,âtill with pity touch'd Your caverns open wide to hide a wretch From hated men,âfrom misery like this.â Enter Teribazus. Afflicted mourner, raise thee from the earth. Zenobia. What voice is thatâI know thee wellâthou ar't That fiend accurst, the murd'rous Teribazus!â Yes thou art welcome! (rising) thou delight'st in bloodâ I am your willing victimâplunge your sword Deep in my heartâI'll thank thee for the stroke, Since thou hast murder'd all my soul held dear. Teribazus. Assuage this storm of grief, nor blame a lover That dotes like meâcould I behold that form Snatch'd from my arms?â Zenobia. You know not what you've doneâ Your blameless brotherâ Teribazus. How! Zenobia. You've murder'd himâ Your brother Rhadamistusâ Teribazus. Rhadamistus!â Zenobia. By thee he diesâthat is your splendid deedâ Teribazus. What say'st thou?âhe my brotherâurge me not To instant madnessâis heâtell meâsayâ Ar't thou Zenobia?â Zenobia. Yes, that fatal wretch!â Teribazus. If this be soâwhat had I done, ye pow'rs! To merit this extremity of woeâ âWhy did'st thou hide the awful secret from me?â Zenobia. Could I betray himâcould I trust your father, Whose fell ambition, whose relentless rage, Has fix'd a price on our devoted heads? Teribazus. Then shall this hated beingâno!âI'll live To save a brother stillâhe shall not dieâ Oh! let me seek him,âthrow me at his feet, Implore forgiveness, and protract his days. [Exit Teribazus. Zenobia, It is in vainâhe's lostâwe both must perishâ And then my childâwho then shall guard his youth? No more these eyes shall see himâmy sweet boy Will break his heart, and unregarded die.â Enter Zopiron. Zopiron. All's lost! all ruin'd!âto the cave of death Ev'n now the guards lead Rhadamistus forth. Zenobia. Thou see'st the sad reverse!âimmortal spirits,â Ye winged virtues,âthat with pitying eye Watch the afflicted,âwill ye not inspire In this sad hour,âone great, one glorious thought, Above the vulgar flight of common souls, To save at once my husband and my child?â âThe inspiration comes!âthe bright idea Expands my heart, and charms my glowing soul. Zopiron. My gracious queen, let not a blind despairâ Zenobia. Talk not, Zopiron, when the god inspires! The god! the god!âmy heart receives him allâ âMy lord, my Rhadamistus still shall live. [Exit. Zopiron. Yet, I conjure thee, hear thy faithful slave.â [Follows her out. Enter Rhadamistus, and Guards. Rhadamistus. Say, whither do you lead me?âdoes your tyrant Repent his horrid outrage? Enter Teribazus. Guards withdraw To a remoter groundâ [Exeunt Soldiers. Rhadamistus, Teribazus. Rhadamistus. Mistaken prince! My heart bleeds for theeâ Teribazus. Oh! too well I know The depth of guilt in which the fates have plung'd me. âI cannot look upon theeâ Rhadamistus. Oh! my brother, Thus let me, ev'n in ruin, thus embrace thee.â Teribazus. Do'st thou forgive me?âcould I e'er have thought To see thee here? my rashness has undone thee!â Rhadamistus. No, thou art innocentâthe guilt is mine, The guilt of mean, ungenerous policy Of selfish wisdom, disingenuous art That from a friend kept back the fatal secret, When with the ardor of unbounded confidence, I should have rush'd with transport to thy arms, Unbosom'd all, and wrapt thee in my heart. Teribazus. Alas! I've heap'd these horrors on your headâ I've seal'd thy doomâthat is a brother's giftâ The first essay of Teribazus' friendship!â But I am doom'd to be a wretch abhorr'd, Of men and gods abhorr'd!âdoom'd like my father To drench these murd'rous hands in brother's blood!â Rhadamistus. Imbitter not the pangs that rive my soulâ Where is Zenobia?âunrelenting pow'rs! Was it for this your persecuting wrath Gave me to meet her, gave that angel-sweetness To these delighted eyes, these eager arms? Teribazus. I'll give you freedom stillâby heav'n I willâ Rhadamistus. Was she but giv'n me to afflict her more? To wake in that dear breast a gleam of joy, A mockery of joy,âjoy scarce, ye pow'rs! Divided by the moment of delight From black despair, from agony and death? Teribazus. I will protect her,âwill restore her to thee, Or do a deed shall strike mankind with horror! Not ev'n a father shall retard my swordâ In his own blood I'll drench itâ Rhadamistus. Ha!â Teribazus. This hand, E're thou shalt fall a victim to his fury, Shall to the heart,âth' inhuman heart of himâ Who daresâ Rhadamistus. No more of thatâcan I consent, That a brave gen'rous youth, a much lov'd brother, For ev'ry virtue fam'd,âshall thus debase By an atrocious deed his fair renown, And perpetrate a dark insidious work? âOh! I should well deserve the worst of illsâ âI then should justify a father's cruelty!â Teribazus. He has undone theeâhas undone us allâ But yet thou shalt not dieâby heav'n I swearâ Yes, take me, horror! pour into my heart Thy blackest purposeânerve my lifted arm To dash him headlong from his glitt'ring throne A terrible example to the world. Rhadamistus. Beware, beware, my brotherâyet reflectâ You would strike vice with terrorâtell me then, Would not the act of rash impetuous zeal, Would not th' example arm the ruffian's hand? Thy virtue thus inflames thy gen'rous ardorâ But oh! my brother, let it not be said That virtue ever held the murd'rer's knife! Teribazus. Gods! have I ruin'd such unheard of goodness?â Swift I'll dispatch a message to Paulinus, And call his legions to assault the campâ Enter Tigranes, and Guards. Tigranes. Guards, seize your pris'nerâin a dungeon's gloom Plunge him sequester'd from the light of heav'n. 'Tis Pharasmanes' willâ Teribazus. Thou medling fiend! I will attend his steps; will still protect him From men like theeâ Rhadamistus. Should Pharasmanes dare To violate the rights of public law, Rome is at hand, and will have ample vengeance. [Exit with Teribazus. Tigranes. My thirst of vengeance shall be sated first.â Yes, guard him, prince; it makes thy ruin sure! Thy Ariana too, while fate is busy, Shall meet her doom, and leave my road to glory All smooth and level to ambition's wish. Enter Zopiron. Zopiron. 'Gainst Rome's ambassador the king, Tigranes, Suspends his sentence till his further orders. The qeen commands it too. Tigranes. The queen!âwhat queen? Zopiron. The beauteous Ariana; now your sovereign. Tigranes. Has she relented?âis she married to him? Zopiron. She isâthe scene with various passions burn'd!â Her tresses all unbound, with faded charms, Yet lovely ev'n in sorrow, thro' the ranks Eager she flew, with shrieks, with outstretch'd arms, Invoking ev'ry god!âthe wond'ring soldier With soften'd sinews, dropt the sword to earth And gaz'd with mix'd emotions as she pass'd. Prone to the ground at Pharasmanes' feet She fellâhe rais'd her soon, and smil'd consentâ To the king's tent she press'd with eager speedâ Th' exulting monarch call'd his priests around him, And soon with solemn march and festive song In his pavillion sought the blooming bride. Tigranes. This sudden change, Zopiron, this rash haste, I like it notâ Zopiron. Nor I Tigranes: doubt, Suspicion, fear, and wonder, and mistrust, Rise in each anxious thoughtâ Tigranes. But did'st thou see The ceremony clos'd?â Zopiron. I did:âat first All pale and trembling Ariana stood. Then more collected, with undaunted step She to the altar bore the nuptial cup. There reverent bow'd, and âhear ye gods,â she said, âHear and record the purpose of my soul.â With trembling lips then kiss'd the sacred vase, And as our country's solemn rites require, Drank of the hallow'd liquor.âFrom her hand The king receiv'd it, and with eager joy, As to his soul he took the nectar'd draught, With stedfast eye she view'd him, whilst a smile Of sickly joy gleam'd faintly o'er her visage. Tigranes. Well, she's our queenâthe diadem is hersâ Zopiron. How long to wear it, heav'n alone can tell.â [The back scene draws, and discovers the king's pavillion, with an altar, and fire blazing on it; soft musick is play'd, and they come forward. Pharasmanes and Zenobia. Pharasmanes. At length my Ariana's soft compliance Endears the present bliss, and gives an earnest Of joy to brighten a long train of years. Zenobia. Alas! fond man expatiates oft in fancy, Unconscious of the fates, and oft in thought Anticipates a bliss he ne'er enjoys. Pharasmanes. Away with gloomy care; for thou ar't mine, Thou, Ariana!âall our future days Shall smile with gay, with ever-young desire, And not a cloud o'ercast the bright serene. Zenobia. And does thy penetrating eye pervade What time has yet in store? Pharasmanes. Why dost thou ask? Zenobia. I have been us'd to griefârelease the Roman, And give him hence safe conduct to his friends;â I then shall be at peace.â Pharasmanes. Beware, beware! Nor rouze again the pangs, that fire a soul, Which fiercely doats like mine. Zenobia. Dismiss him hence; Give him his lifeâit was your marriage vow He should not sufferâlet me see him first;â Grant me one interview,âone little hour; In that poor space I can crowd all that's left me Of love, and tenderness, and fond concern, Before we part for everâ Pharasmanes. Fond concern! And love, and tenderness!âand shall the Roman Usurp a monarch's due?âthat look betrays The secret workings of a heart estrang'd! And shall the man, who dares dispute my love, Shall the slave breathe a moment?âhaste, Tigranes, And see immediate execution on him. [Exit Tigranes. Zenobia. Oh! stay Tigranesâbarb'rous man, recall The horrid mandateâ Pharasmanes. By immortal love, I see the slave still triumphs in your heart. Zenobia. Oh! spare him, spare himâby the vital air, By your own promis'd faithâ [Kneels to him. Pharasmanes. Since lov'd by thee His doom is doubly seal'd.â Zenobia. You shall not fly meâ Now tear me, drag me groveling in the dust, Tear off these handsâtear, tear me peice-meal firstâ Pharasmanes. Nay, then since force must do itâ [Shakes her off. Zenobia. Barb'rous tyrant! [She lies stretch'd on the ground. Pharasmanes. I go to see the minion of your heart Expire in pangs before meâha!âwhat means This more than winter's frost that chills my veins?â Zenobia. (Looking up) That groan revives, and calls me back to life!â Pharasmanes. I cannot moveâeach vital function's lostâ The purple current of my blood is stoptâ I freezeâI burnâoh! 'tis the stroke of deathâ [Falls on the ground. Zenobia. (Rising) Yes, tyrant, yes; it is the stroke of death And I inflict itâI have done it allâ Pharasmanes. Pernicious trait'ress! thou!â Zenobia. My vengeance did itâ Zenobia's vengeance!â'tis Zenobia strikesâ Zenobia executes her justice on thee!â Pharasmanes. Oh! dire accurst event!âar't thou Zenobia? Zenobia. Yes, thou fell monster, know me for Zenobia! Know the ambassador is Rhadamistus! Haste thee, Zopiron, and proclaim him king. [Exit Zopiron. Pharasmanes. May curses light upon theeâoh! I die, And racks and wheels disjoint meâ Zenobia. Writhe in torment, In fiercer pangs than my dear father knew. âBut I revenge his deathâI dash'd the cup With precious poison!â(a flourish of trumpets) ha!ânow tyrant wake, And hear those soundsâmy Rhadamistus reigns!â Pharasmanes. What and no help!âit is too lateâthe fates, The fiends surround meâmore than Ãtna's fires Burn in my veinsâyet heav'nânoâ'tis in vainâ I cannot riseâmy crimesâmy tenfold crimesâ They pull me!âoh!â [Dies. Zenobia. There fled the guilty spirit, Shade of my father view your daughter now! Behold her struggling in a righteous cause! Behold her conqu'ring in the tyrant's camp! Behold your murd'rer levell'd in the dust!â A second flourish of trumpets. Rhadamistus. (Within the scenes) Where is Zenobia?â Zenobia. Rhadamistus, here!â Enter Rhadamistus, Teribazus, Megistus, Zopiron, &amp;c. Rhadamistus. Oh! let me, let me thus,âthus pour my soul, Thus speak my joy,âthus melt within thy arms.â Zenobia. My lord! my life, my Rhadamistus!âcome, Grow to my heart,âthat bounds and springs to meet thee.â Rhadamistus. Once more reviv'd and snatch'd again from death Thus do I see thee?âthese are speechless joys, And tears alone express themâ Zenobia. Have I sav'd thee? All-gracious gods! 'tis rapture in th' extreme!â Rhadamistus. My sweet deliverer! my all of bliss!â Zenobia. Oh! it is joy too exquisite!âand yet Grief will imbitter ecstacy like this!â There lies your father! Rhadamistus. All his crimes Be buried with him!ânature will have way, And o'er his corse thus sheds the filial tear. Teribazus. Oh! that my tears could wash away his stains!â Zenobia. Wilt thou forgive his murderer?â Rhadamistus. For thee, Beset with wrongs, and injur'd as thou wer't, In ev'ry region fame shall clap her wings, And the recording muse applaud thy virtue. Zenobia. If thou forgiv'st me, I am bless'd indeed! Now we shall part no moreâMegistus too!â Thou good old man!âlet me embrace theeâha! Megistus. The blood forsakes her cheekâher eyes are fix'd!â Zenobia. Support meâhelp meâoh! I dieâI die.â [Falls in Megistus' arms. Rhadamistus. She faintsâher colour diesârevive Zenobia;â Revive my love;âthy Rhadamistus thus, Thus calls your flutt'ring spirit back to life. Zenobia. It will not beâthe toil of life is o'erâ My Rhadamistusâ [Sinks down on the ground. Rhadamistus. Must I lose thee then?â Zenobia. Oh! the envenom'd cup!âthe marriage rites Requir'd that I should drink it first myselfâ There was no other wayâI did it freely To save thy lifeâto save thee for my child.â Rhadamistus. A'rt thou a victim for a wretch like me? Is there no antidote to stop the course Of this vile poison?â Zenobia. Noneâit rages nowâ It rages thro' my veinsâmy eyes grow dimâ They're lost in darknessâoh!âI cannot see theeâ Where art thou, Rhadamistus?âmust I breathe Longer in life,âand never see thee more!â And are my eyes forbid one dear farewell? Oh! cruel stars!âmust they not fix on thee The last expiring glance?â Rhadamistus. Relentless pow'rs! There lies Zenobia!âround that pallid beauty Call your Ã¦therial host, each winged virtue, Call ev'ry angel down,âbid 'em behold That matchless excellence, and then refuse Soft pity if they can!â Zenobia. Megistus,âseek my child,â And bring him to his fatherâRhadamistus,â âWilt thou protect him?âMy sweet orphan-babe I leave thee too!âoh! train him up in virtueâ Wilt thou be fond of himâa mother's fondness My child should meetâoh! raise me, Rhadamistusâ Give me thy handâmy little infantâoh!â [Dies. Rhadamistus. Tears, you do well to stopâyour wretched drops Are unavailing at a sight like this!â And art thou gone?âah! thus defac'd and pale, Thus do I see thee?âis that ghastly form All that is left me of thee?âgive me daggers, âGive me some instant means of death, my friends, That I may throw this load of life away, And let our hearts be both inurn'd together. Teribazus. Live, live my brother, for your infant sonâ Let him prevailâ Rhadamistus. Inhuman that thou art! Think you I'll stay imprison'd here in life, When thereâbehold herâhow she smiles in death!â When there that formâthink ye I'll linger here?â Dead, dead Zenobia!âstill I have thee thusâ You ne'er shall part usâthis at least I'll hold, And cling for ever to these pale, pale charms; Here breathe my last, and faithful still in death, Love shall unite us in one peaceful grave. Megistus. Now, old Megistus, gods! has liv'd too long!â Teribazus. Bring ev'ry aid, all medicinal skill To call a wretched brother back to life, And give each lenient balm to woes like his. From thee ambition, what misfortunes flow? To thee what varied ills weak mortals owe? 'Twas this for years laid desolate the land, And arm'd against a son the father's hand; To black despair poor lost Zenobia drove; The hapless victim of disastrous love!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE: Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq; And Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON. (She peeps thro' the Curtain) How do you all, good folks?âIn tears for certain, I'll only take a Peep behind the Curtain; You're all so full of tragedy, and sadness! For me to come among ye, would be madness: This is no time for gigglingâwhen you've leisure, Call out for me, and I'll attend your pleasure; As soldiers hurry at the beat of drum, Beat but your hands, that instant I will come. [She enters upon their clapping. This is so good, to call me out so soonâ The Comic Muse by me intreats a BOON; She call'd for Pritchard, her first maid of honour, And begg'd of her to take the task upon her; But she,âI'm sure you'll all be sorry for't, Resigns her place, and soon retires from court: To bear this loss, we courtiers make a shift, When good folks leave us, worse may have a lift. The Comic Muse, whose ev'ry smile is grace, And her Stage Sister, with her tragic face, Have had a quarrelâeach has writ a Case. And on their friends assembled now I wait, To give you of their difference A true State. Melpomene, complains when she appears,â For five good acts, in all her pomp of tears, To raise your souls, and with her raptures wing 'em, Nay wet your handkerchiefs, that you may wring 'em. Some flippant hussey, like myself comes in; Crack goes her fan, and with a giggling grin, Hey! Presto pass!âall topsy turvy see, For HO, HO, HO! is chang'd to HE, HE, HE! We own the fault, but 'tis a fault in vogue, 'Tis theirs, who call and bawl forâEpilogue! O! shame upon youâfor the time to come, Know betterâand go miserable home. What says our Comic Goddess?âwith reproaches, She vows her Sister Tragedy encroaches! And spite of all her virtue, and ambition, Is known to have an am'rous disposition: For in False Delicacyâwond'rous sly, Join'd with a certain IrishmanâO fye! She made you, when you ought to laugh, to cry.â Her sister's smiles with tears she try'd to smother, Rais'd such a tragi-comic kind of pother, You laugh'd with one eye, while you cry'd with t'other. What can be done?âsad work behind the scenes There comic females scold with tragic queens. Each party different ways the foe assails, These shake their daggers, those prepare their nails. 'Tis YOU alone must calm these dire mishaps, Or we shall still continue pulling caps. What is your will?âI read it in your faces; That all hereafter take their proper places, Shake hands, and kiss and friends, andâBURN THEIR CASES.</field>
