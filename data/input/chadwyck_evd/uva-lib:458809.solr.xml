      <field name="fulltext">THE SPEECHES AT PRINCE HENRIES BARRIERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Lady of the Lake , first discouered. A silence, calme as are my waters, meet Your raysd attentions, whilst my siluer fee Touch on the richer shore; and to this seat Vow my new duties and mine old repeat. Lest any yet should doubt, or might mistake What Nymph I am; behold the ample lake Of which I am stild; and neere it Merlins tombe Graue of his cunning, as of mine the wombe. By this it will not aske me to proclaime More of my selfe, whose actions, and whose name Were so full fain'd in Brittish Arthvrs court; No more then it will fit me to report What hath before bene trusted to our squire Of me, my knight, his fate, and my desire To meet, if not preuent his destiny And stile him to the court of Britany; Now when the Iland hath regain'd her fame Intire, and perfect, in the ancient name, And that a monarch Ã¦quall good and great, Wise, temperate, iust, and stout claimes Arthvrs seat. Did I say Ã¦quall? O too prodigall wrong Of my or'e-thirsty, and vnÃ¦quall tongue! How brighter farre, then when our Arthvr liu'd Are all the glories of this place reuiu'd! What riches doe I see; what beauties here! What awe! what loue! what reuerence! ioy! and feare! What ornaments of counsaile as of court! All that is high and great, or cancomport Vnto the stile of maiesty, that knowes No riuall, but it selfe, this place here showes. Onely the house of Chiualrie (how ere The inner parts and store be full, yet here In that which gentry should sustaine) decayed Or rather ruin'd seemes; her buildings layd Flat with the earth; that were the pride of time And did the barbarous Memphian heapes out-clime Those Obilisks and Columnes broke, and downe, That strooke the starres, and raisd the British crowne To be a constellation: Shields and swords, Cob-webd, and rusty; not a helme affords A sparke of lustre, which were wont to giue Light to the world, and made the nation liue, When in a day of honour fire was smit To haue put out Vvlcan's and haue lasted yet. O, when this Ãdifice stood great and high That in the carcasse hath such maiesty, Whose very sceleton boasts so much worth, What grace, what glories did it then send forth? When to the structure went more noble names Then the Ephesian temple lost in flames: When euery stone was laid by vertuous hands; And standing so, (O that it yet not stands.) More truth of architecture there was blaz'd, Then liu'd in all the ignorant Gothes haue raz'd. There Porticos were built, and seats for knights That watched for all aduentures, dayes and nights The Nieces filld with statues, to inuite Young valures forth, by their old formes to fight. With arkes triumphall for their actions done, Out-striding the Collossus of the sunne. And TrophÃ¦es, reard, of spoyled enemies, Whose toppes pierc'd through the cloudes, and hit the skies. ARTHVR. Discouerd as a starre aboue And thither hath thy voyce pierc'd. Stand not maz'd, Thy eyes haue here on greater glories gaz'd And not beene frighted. I thy Arthvr am Translated to a starre; and of that frame Or constellation that was calld of mee So long before, as showing what I should bee. Arctvrvs, once thy king, and now thy starre. Such the rewards of all good princes are. Nor let it trouble thy designe, faire dame, That I am present to it with my flame And influence; since the times are now deuolu'd That Merlin's misticke prophesies are absolu'd, In Brittain's name, the vnion of this Ile; And clayme both of my scepter and my stile. Faire fall his vertue, that doth fill that throne In which I ioy, to find my selfe so'out-shone; And for the greater, wish, men should him take As it is nobler to restore then make. Proceed in thy great worke; bring forth thy knight Preserued for his times, that by the might And magicke of his arme, he may restore These ruin'd seates of vertue, and build more. Let him be famous, as was Tristram, Tor. Lavnc'lot, and all our List of knight-hood: or Who were before, or haue beene since. His name Strike vpon heauen, and there sticke his fame. Beyond the paths, and searches of the sunne Let him tempt fate; and when a world is wunne, Submit it duely to this state, and throne Till time, and vtmost stay make that his owne. But first receiue this shield; wherein is wrought The truth that he must follow; and (being taught The wayes from heauen) ought not be despisd. It is a piece, was by the fates deuisd To arme his maiden valure; and to show Defensiue armes th'offensiue should fore-goe. Indowe him with it Lady of the lake. And for the other mysteries, here, awake The learned Merlin; when thou shutst him there, Thou buriedst valure too, for letters reare The deeds of honor high, and make them liue. If then thou seeke to restore prowesse, giue His spirit freedome; then present thy knight: For armes and arts sustaine each others right. LADY. My error I acknowledge, though too late To expiate it; There's no resisting fate. Arise great soule; Fame by surreption got May stead vs for the time, but lasteth not. O, doe not rise with storme, and rage. Forgiue Repented wrongs. I'am cause thou now shalt liue Ãternally, for being deprest a while, Want makes vs know the price of what we auile. MERLIN. Arising out of the tombe. I neither storme, nor rage; tis earth; blame her That feeles these motions when great spirits stirre. She is affrighted, and now chid by heauen, Whilst we walke calmely on, vpright and euen. Call forth the faire Meliadvs, thy knight They are his fates that make the elements fight: And these but vsuall throwes, when time sends forth A wonder or a spectacle of worth. At common births the world feeles nothing new; At these she shakes; Mankind liues in a few. LADY. The heauens, the fates, and thy peculiar starres, Meliadvs shew thee; and conclude all iarres. Meliadvs, and his sixe assistants here discouered. MERLIN. I, now the spheares are in their tunes againe. What place is this so bright that doth remaine Yet vndemolishd? or but late built! O I read it now. St George's Portico! The supreme head of all the world, where now Knighthood liues honord with a crowned brow. A noble Scene, and fit to shew him in That must of all worlds fame the ghirland winne. LADY. Do's he not sit like Mars, or one that had The better of him, in his armor clad? And those his sixe assistants, as the pride Of the old GrÃ¦cian Heroes had not died? Or like Apollo, raisd to the worlds view, The minute after he the Python slew. MERLIN. Tis all too little, Lady, you can speake. My thought growes great of him, and faine would breake. Inuite him forth, and guide him to his tent, That I may read this shield his fates present. LADY. Glory of knights, and hope of all the earth, Come forth; your fostresse bids; who from your birth Hath bred you to this hower, and for this throne. This is the field to make your vertue knowne. If he were now (he sayes) to vow his fires Of faith, of loue, of seruice, then his squires Had vttered nothing for him: But he hopes In the first tender of himselfe, his scopes Were so well read, as it were no decor'me Where truth is studied, there to practise forme. MERLIN. No, let his actions speake him; and this shield Let downe from heauen, that to his youth will yeeld Such copy of incitement: Not the deedes Of antique knights, to catch their fellowes steedes Or ladies palfreyes, rescue from the force Of a fell gyant, or some score to vn-horse. These were bold stories of our Arthvrs age; But here are other acts; another stage And scene appeares; it is not since as then: No gyants, dwarfes, or monsters here, but men. His arts must be to gouerne, and giue lawes To peace no lesse then armes. His fate here drawes An empire with it, and describes each state Preceding there, that he should imitate. First, faire Meliadvs, hath shee wrought an Ile, The happiest of the earth (which to your stile In time must adde) and in it placed high Britayne, the only name, made Caesar flie. Within the neerer parts, as apt, and due To your first speculation, you may view The eye of iustice shooting through the land, Like a bright planet strengthned by the hand Of first, and warlike Edward; then th'increase Of trades and tillage, vnder lawes and peace, Begun by him, but settled and promou'd By the third Heroe of his name, who lou'd To set his owne aworke, and not to see The fatnesse of his land a portion bee For strangers. This was he erected first The trade of clothing, by which arte were nurst Whole millions to his seruice, and releeu'd So many poore, as since they haue beleeu'd The golden fleece, and need no forrayne mine, If industrie at home doe not decline. To proue which true, obserue what treasure here The wise and seuenth Henry heapt each yeere, To be the strength and sinewes of a warre, When Mars should thunder, or his peace but iarre. And here how the eighth Henry his braue sonne Built forts, made generall musters, trayn'd youth on In exercise of armes, and girt his coast With strength; to which (whose fame no tongue can boast Vp to her worth, though all best tongues be glad To name her still) did great Eliza adde A wall of shipping, and became thereby The ayde, or feare of all the nations nigh. These worthyest Prince, are set you neere to reade, That ciuill arts the martiall must precede. That lawes and trade bring honors in and gayne, And armes defensiue a safe peace maintayne. But when your fate shall call you forth to'assure Your vertue more (though not to make secure) View here, what great examples shee hath plac'd. First, two braue Britayne Heroes, that were grac'd To fight their Sauiours battailes, and did bring Destruction on the faithlesse; one a king, Richard, surnamed with the lyons hart. The other Edward, and the first, whose part (Then being but Prince) it was to lead these warres In the age after, but with better starres. For here though CÃ¦ur de lion like a storme Powre on the Saracens, and doth performe Deedes past an angell, arm'd with wroth and fire, Ploughing whole armies vp, with zealous ire, And walled cities, while he doth defend That cause that should all warres begin and end; Yet when with pride, and for humane respect The Austrian cullors he doth here deiect With too much scorne, behold at length how fate Makes him a wretched prisoner to that state; And leaues him, as a marke of Fortunes spight, When Princes tempt their starres beyond their light: Whilst vpright Edward shines no lesse then he, Vnder the wings of golden victorie, Nor lets out no lesse riuers of the bloud Of Infidels, but makes the field a floud, And marches through it, with S. Georges crosse, Like Israels host to the Ãgyptians losse, Through the red sea: the earth beneath him cold And quaking such an enemie to behold. For which, his temper'd zeale, see Prouidence Flying in here, and armes him with defence Against th'assassinate made vpon his life By a foule wretch, from whom he wrests the knife, And giues him a iust hire: which yet remaynes A warning to great chiefes, to keepe their traynes About 'hem still, and not, to priuacie, Admit a hand that may vse treacherie. Neerer then these, not for the same high cause, Yet for the next (what was his right by lawes Of nations due) doth fight that Mars of men The black Prince Edward, 'gainst the French, who then At Cressey field had no more yeeres then you, Here his glad father has him in the view As he is entring in the schoole of warre, And powres all blessings on him from a farre That wishes can; whilst he (that close of day) Like a yong lyon, newly taught to prey, Inuades the herds, so fled the french, and teares From the Bohemian crowne the plume he weares, Which after for his crest he did preserue To his fathers vse, with this fit word, I SERVE. But here at Poictiers he was Mars indeed. Neuer did valour with more streame succeed Then he had there. He flow'd out like a sea Vpon their troupes, and left their armes no way: Or like a fire carryed with high windes Now broad, and spreading, by and by it findes A vent vpright, to looke which way to burne. Then shootes along againe, or round doth turne, Till in the circling spoile it hath embrac'd All that stood nigh, or in the reach to wast: Such was his rage that day; but then forgot Soone as his sword was sheath'd, it lasted not, After the King, the Dauphine, and french Peeres By yeelding to him, wisely quit their feares, Whom he did vse with such humanitie, As they complayn'd not of captiuitie; But here to England without shame came in. To be his captiues was the next to win. Yet rests the other thunder-bolt of warre, Harry the fift, to whom in face you are So like, as Fate would haue you so in worth, Illustrious Prince. This vertue ne're came forth, But Fame flue greater for him, then shee did For other mortalls; Fate her selfe did bid To saue his life: The time it reach'd vnto, Warre knew not how to giue'him enough to doe. His very name made head against his foes. And here at Agin-Court where first it rose, It there hangs still a comet ouer France, Striking their malice blind, that dare aduance A thought against it, lightned by your flame That shall succeed him both in deedes and name. I could report more actions yet of weight Out of this orbe, as here of eightie eight, Against the proud Armada, stil'd by Spaine The Inuincible; that couer'd all the mayne, As if whole Ilands had broke loose, and swame; Or halfe of Norway with her firre-trees came, To ioyne the continents, it was so great; Yet by the auspice of Eliza beat: That deare belou'd of heauen, whom to preserue The windes were call'd to fight, and stormes to serue. One tumor drown'd another, billowes stroue To out-swell ambition, water ayre out-droue, Though shee not wanted on that glorious day, An euer honor'd Howard to display S. Georges ensigne; and of that high race A second, both which ply'd the fight and chase: And sent first bullets, then a fleet of fire, Then shot themselues like ordinance; and a tire Of ships for pieces, through the enemies moone, That wan'd before it grew, and now they soone Are rent, spoild, scatterd, tost with all disease, And for their thirst of Britayne drinke the seas. The fish were neuer better fed than then, Although at first they fear'd the bloud of men Had chang'd their element; and Neptvne shooke As if the thunderer had his palace tooke. So here in Wales, Low Countries, France, and Spayne, You may behold both on the land and mayne The conquests got, the spoiles, the trophÃ¦es reard By British kings, and such as no blest heard Of all the nation, which may make t'inuite Your valure vpon need, but not t'incite Your neighbour Princes, giue them all their due, And be prepar'd if they will trouble you. He doth but scourge himselfe, his sword that drawes Without a purse, a counsaile and a cause. But all these spurres to vertue, seedes of praise Must yeeld to this that comes. Here's one will raise Your glorie more, and so aboue the rest, As if the acts of all mankind were prest In his example. Here are kingdomes mixt And nations ioyn'd, a strength of empire fixt Conterminate with heauen; The golden veine Of Satvrnes age is here broke out againe. Henry but ioyn'd the roses, that ensign'd Particular families, but this hath ioyn'd The Rose and Thistle, and in them combin'd A vnion, that shall neuer be declin'd. Ireland that more in title, then in fact Before was conquer'd is his Lawrels act. The wall of shipping by Eliza made, Decay'd (as all things subiect are to fade) He hath new built, or so restor'd, that men For noble vse, preferre it afore then: Royall, and mightie Iames, whose name shall set A goale for all posteritie to sweat, In running at by actions hard and high: This is the height at which your thoughts must fly. He knowes both how to gouerne, how to saue What subiects, what their contraries should haue, What can be done by power, and what by loue, What should to Mercie, what to Iustice moue: All Arts he can, and from the hand of Fate Hath he enforc'd the making his owne date Within his proper vertue hath he plac'd His guards 'gainst Fortune, and there fixed fast The wheele of chance, about which Kings are hurl'd, And whose outragious raptures fill the world. LADY. I, this is hee, Meliadvs, whom you Must only serue, and giue your selfe vnto: And by your diligent practice to obay So wise a Master learne the arte of sway. Merlin, aduance the shield vpon his tent And now prepare faire Knight to proue th'euent Of your bold Challenge. Bee your vertue steeld, And let your drumme giue note you keepe the field. Is this the land of Britaine so renownd For deeds of Armes, or are their hearings drownd That none doe answere? MERLIN. Stay, me thinkes I see A person in yond'caue. Who should that bee? I know her ensignes now: 'Tis Cheualrie Possess'd with sleepe, dead as a lethargie: If any charme will wake her, 'tis the name Of our Meliadvs. I'll vse his Fame. Lady, Meliadvs, lord of the Iles, Princely Meliadvs, and whom Fate now stiles The faire Meliadvs, hath hung his shield Vpon his tent, and here doth keepe the field, According to his bold and princely word; And wants employment for his pike, and sword. CHEVALRY. Were it from death that name would wake mee. Say Which is the Knight? O I could gaze a day Vpon his armour that hath so reuiu'd My spirits and tels me that I am long liu'd In his apparance. Breake you rustie dores That haue so long beene shut, and from the shores Of all the world, come knight-hood like a flood Vpon these lists, to make the field, here, good, And your owne honours, that are now call'd forth Against the wish of men to proue your worth. THE BARRIORS. After which Merlin speakes. Nay, stay your valure, 'tis a wisdome high In Princes to vse fortune reuerently. He that in deeds of Armes obeyes his blood Doth often tempt his destinie beyond good. Looke on this throne, and in his temper view The light of all that must haue grace in you: His equall Iustice, vpright Fortitude And settled Prudence, with that Peace indued Of face, as minde, alwayes himselfe and euen. So Hercvles, and good men beare vp heauen. I dare not speake his vertues for the feare Of flattring him, they come so high and neare To wonders: yet thus much I prophesy Of him and his. All eares your selues apply. You, and your other you, great King and Queene, Haue yet the least of your bright Fortune seene, Which shal rise brighter euery houre with Time, And in your pleasure quite forget the crime Of change; your ages night shall be her noone. And this yong Knight, that now puts forth so soone Into the world, shall in your names atchieue More ghyrlands for this state, and shall relieue Your cares in gouernment; while that yong lord Shall second him in Armes, and shake a sword And launce against the foes of God and you. Nor shall lesse ioy your royall hopes pursue In that most princely Mayd whose forme might call The world to warre, and make it hazard all His valure for her beautie, she shall bee Mother of nations, and her Princes see Riuals almost to these. Whilst you sit high And lead by them behold your Britaine fly Beyond the line, when what the seas before Did bound, shall to the sky then stretch his shore.</field>
