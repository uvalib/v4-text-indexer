      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âWizard alone in his room. WIZARD. For eighty years I studied magic lore; I slaved in patience eighty years and more To friendless age, from manhood bold and lusty, Mid moths and mildew, skulls, and volumes musty. Here do I live, in gloomy study housed, A poor disciple of old Doctor Faust. One night I watched o'er human joy and dole, From the small skylight of my glory hole: The woods and silver-sheeted Rhine I viewed, When from his bosom rose the scaly brood Of Sprites and Mermen, o'er the water popping, And, in fantastic gambols, springing, flopping, Diving, and splashing, till tormented Rhine With foam and phosphorus seemed to splash and shine; Then one white figure, all in white arrayed, Swam right ashore, and for the forest made. I marked her well, as was a wizard's duty. She was a nymph of most surpassing beauty. Even I could feel a soft emotion rise At her gold clouds of hair and dreamy eyes. Onward she went, like one that walked in slumber; I breathed a spell, and named a magic number: Some potent counter charm seemed to prevail, For on she wentâtho' moved and deadly pale. The Baron's Castle, then, I saw her enter; She'll make sad mischief, if I can't prevent her. Old Faust, when powers of evil used to cross him, Would open at the sign of âMacrocosm;â Now, following his illustrious example, I'll view the magic page, mouldy and ample. [Opens the book. A sound of rushing water meets my ear. Ho! scaly spirit, at my call appear! [Gobbet, a green Sprite, jumps out of the book. GOBBET. I come, good master. Ho! I come like winkin'. WIZARD. Most promptly done, my stern command now drink in. Some time ago, upon a moonlight night, Entered yon Castle, a fair Water Sprite. My wonted skill was useless, I confess, And soon, no doubt, she made a precious mess. GOBBET. Aye, aye, good sir; you mulled the business nicely. WIZARD. Long time I knew not what to say precisely. She has inveigled from his late affection The Fraulein's lover, of immense connection; She loves the Sprite, and leaves the Baron's daughter, And soon, I fear, she'll lure him to the water. GOBBET. A pretty story! What's your will, good master? WIZARD. Haste to the Castleâcounteract disaster. Promptly upon the Water Sprite attend; But with sly acts the family befriend. [Gobbet bows grotesquely and exit. Scene II. âThe old Baron alone in his study. BARON. I'm in the grumpsâbut why, I cannot tellâ I'm very illâI'm seriously unwell; Though for domestic bliss by nature fitted, Smacked by my wife, and by my daughter twitted. But this new comer most provokes my gall; This madcap strangerâwho is she at all? Some say it was at nightâsome say at noon She just dropt in, as though dropt from the moon. She takes her fling, and nothing is debarr'd her; She rules the roast, and revels in the larder. With choicest tit-bits keeps her wolfish maw full, For 'twixt ourselves her appetite is awful; She chokes my pipe, and laughs at my lumbago, And rules the Frau, that notable virago! [Frau sings within. Hush! 'tis my wife, as grim as an inquisitor! What saith the proverb, touching the Old Visitor? Oh! that some opening trap-door would engulph her! Here comes the old one!âwhat a smell of sulphur! Enter Frau. FRAU. [Aside.] I'll try the civil dodgeâthough scold I ought. [Aloud.] Well Baron, dear, a penny for your thought. BARON. It was not worth so muchâI thought of you. FRAU. Your answer is amusing, and quite new. Just now we can't afford to be so funny; Pray think about your daughter and your money. BARON. My daughter and my ducatsâstale old song. FRAU. Baron! BARON. Well, go-ahead! but don't be long. Poor love-sick daughter; is she very bad? FRAU. Man! do you mean to drive me dancing mad? All our misfortunes give you little pain, Caused, every one, by your old fuddled brain. That most outrageous minx again has crost Our daughter's marriage prospectsâall is lost! Our wealthy suitor, poor Johanna jilts, And with that vixen flirts, and talks on stilts, And skips attendance on her, like a lacquey. What! not a symptom of surprise? BARON. Oh! Cracky! FRAU. I'm in a fury! BARON. Take it easy, Frau. FRAU. Baron, I'll pull your nose, sir! BARON. Bowâwowâwow! FRAU. I can't believe my earsâwhom bark you at? BARON. At you, my love! FRAU. Take thatâand thatâand that. [Exit Frau, after boxing Baron's ears. BARON (alone). My bark was vastly better than her bite; If what she says is true, 'twill serve her right. I'm always bilious after such a frayâ I'll go to sleepâand not awake to-day. [Sings. Nothing for your gouty toper, Safe from noisy interloper, Like a long refreshing sopor, That's the Latin for a doze. Oh! how cheery when we're weary, Blandly healing ruffled feeling. When he's fast asleep and snoring, Pain and crusty wife ignoring, Never groaningânever roaring, Oh! how glorious is a doze. Oh! how cheeryâwhen we're wearyâ Blandlyâhealingâruffâ [Sleeps, and snores. Thunder and lightning. Enter Rhine King. BARON (starting up). Ho! all hands to the pump. SaveâOh! I'm sunk. I'm either half-seas overâor I'm drunk! Ho! bucketsâbrandyâbladdersâanything! RHINE KING. Behold his Majesty the great Rhine King. Bid us all hail! BARON. Hallo! All hail and thunder! Who's this old water-spout, I greatly wonder? RHINE KING. I raised but now above the reedy Rhine My watery stature, where for ages nine I held mild reignâo'er regions soft and pleasant. BARON. Mild rain! my friend, you're raining hard at present. Have you a chance of clearing? for, by Nemesis! If you don't clear, I'll quickly clear the premises. RHINE KING. Peace, dotard, or I'll founder you with water. I come to pay a visit to my daughter; Where does she hold her state? BARON. Oh, goodness knows! Don't you cascade upon my gouty toes. RHINE KING. About a month ago, or near that period, My daughter left my halls, a green-haired Neriad, And on a moonlight night your Castle sought. Dost thou remember? BARON. Well, I think I ought. RHINE KING. So be it! How is my daughter thriving? How didst thou entertain her on arriving? BARON. She helped herself to everything. RHINE KING. So best. Nought is too good for such a noble guest. Go fetch her: bid her wait on no pretences. BARON. My good fellow, are you in your senses? Before I'd leave my chair to fetch your daughter, I'd see you on the fire and changed to boiling water. RHINE KING (furious). Insulted to my beard! But thou shalt quakeâdog! I'll change thy lands and castle to a shake-bog; Thy halls shall lodge the loathsome bat and vile owl, Thyself and Frau shall fly away like wild fowl. Insulted to my beard so long and hoary! Vanish instanter to a lower story. Baron sinks (or drawn aside on his chair.) Enter Luralie, attended by Gobbet. LURALIE. Of common propriety have you no feeling? You sent the old Baron right down through my ceiling. I don't like your beard, nor your great glassy eyes, And this visit has given me less joy than surprise. GOBBET. We're quite happy without you, and not the least lonely. RHINE KING. Peace, sea-pig; I'm speaking to Luralie only. My crystal fountain, Luralie, thou art: To see thee lifts the cockles of my heart. Come back, come back, my Luralie, unto thy home of water, My halls are sad and lone to me, my daughter, oh, my daughter! Come backâcome back! LURALIE. No, thank you, sir. RHINE KING. Come back, ma'am. LURALIE. Stay I'd rather. RHINE KING. Ye thunders, what a dreadful shame! The girl disowns her father! LURALIE. I will not return, were you ever so fluent. RHINE KING. Thou art not in earnest, my dear little truant. GOBBET. Oh, yes! quite in earnest, old gentleman. RHINE KING. S'blud! If you speak one word more, I'll dissolve you to mud. [To Luralie.] Canst thou leave thy old father alone to his sorrow? LURALIE. Oh, yes! you may coax me to-day and to-morrow. RHINE KING. Undutiful girl, 'tis thy father who calls: He longs for thy voice in his desolate halls; Each tide that returns his affection grows stronger. LURALIE. A very good reason to wait a while longer. RHINE KING. Unnatural daughter, my feelings I stifle: I give thee one month more to wanton and trifle. Till my sixtieth tide hath returned to the sea, And the sign of the Fishes reflected shall be On the blue-water roof of my palace belowâ Till then, thou hast power to remain, or to go. LURALIE. And how is my pet, the large river trout? RHINE KING. Disconsolately he is swimming about. LURALIE. I hope you take care of my great sea-shell. RHINE KING. It is safe. LURALIE. And my pale river sisters? RHINE KING. Are well. They wait for you here; you shall see them to-night, In their fillets of rushes and garments of white. With a wave of my wand I'll disclose in a jiffy, Earth's loveliest river, excepting the Liffey. [Scene opens: beautiful tableau of Rhine and Nymphs. There's a mirror that's fit for the stars and the moon. Come, girls, to old Rhine a sweet madrigal tune. SONGâNYMPH CHORUS. Joyfully carol we, joyfully carol weâ While Father Rhine rolls blithely along. Merrily let it beâmerrily let it be: Light as his wave be our song. RHINE KING. Hush! Do you dare to disturb the gravity Of the stern old Rhine with levity, Ruffling his serene longevity? Daughter, chant it solemnly. NYMPH CHORUS. Solemnlyâsolemnly, mighty one, we chant it, Mournfully let it be, magic tones incanted, With thy hoary age condoling, turret crowned King for centuries rolling, Moaning wide, thy plaintive tide, swelleth our chorus solemnly. KING. Farewell, my daughter, till the fatal day; But pause not, when thy carriage stops the way. [Exit all. Scene III. âA Room in the Castle. Luralie seated. Enter Frau and Johanna. JOHANNA. Oh, mother, speak to her, you must implore her: Just lay my melancholy case before her; Tell her I know that half in sport 'tis done, But say she's killing me, and all for fun. Ask her the cause of the ill-will she bears me, Say I will try to love her, if she spares me. FRAU. You know, my dear, it never was my weakness To stoop to wrongs, or insolence, with meekness. The fact, indeed, your silly father knows, That creature has bewitched me, I suppose: My tongue to do its duty quite refuses, And at my fingers' ends my courage oozes. LURALIE (getting up). What want you, Frau? Pray hasten, we're engaged. FRAU. Is she an Empress? Oh, I am enraged! Ma'am, I must say your actions are most strange: We hope your line of conduct you will change! [Aside.] I cannot scold her, there's no use in trying. LURALIE. I see you think me far too self-denying, But at your kind request, so urgent really, I shall indulge myself somewhat more freely. FRAU. I wish I couldâ LURALIE. Express for me your kindness. JOHANNA. Those who won't see, how hopeless is their blindness. FRAU. Don't you intend to take a nice excursion? We should contribute much to your diversion. You are not looking well. I wish you would; 'Twould brace your nerves, and do a deal of good. Far up the Rhine, by steam and favouring tide. Pray do; we'll furnish you with Wier's Guide. LURALIE. Good Frau, you never could get on without me; I've such engaging little ways about me. You dear old thing, that turban is so tastyâ Now just run down, and mind the ven'son pasty. Come, such a bustling housewife I would make you. FRAU. Am I the mistress here? Oh, sorrow take you. [Exit Frau. LURALIE (to Johanna.) Well, Fraulein dear, I thought you would escort her. JOHANNA. If you had any heart, you'd give me quarter. Dear Luralie, to my petition hearken, And don't my little gleam of sunshine darkenâ Don't treat a poor young creature in this fashion; But give me back my lover in compassion. LURALIE. Pray what's all this about? you must be raving. Is it my gay young bridegroom you are craving You take him for a puppet; can I make you A present of a youth, if he won't take you? JOHANNA. Don't be too sure, though little you suspect, You may find out my hopes are not all wrecked. LURALIE. Soft then! We'll try. Your Zoeline you'll find Somewhere about the study window blind: Make up to him; I'll hie to the plantation, While you engage in desperate flirtation. But in the midst, when you shall be most tragic, I'll softly sing an air of sweetest magic; I lay you any wager that you'd wish He'll leave you lonely, as a stranded fish. JOHANNA. Presumptuous girl! I lay you two to one, Though not to betting given. LURALIE. Fair Fraulein, done! [They shake hands. JOHANNA. Then I defy you, you may do your best. I'll put my fortune to a final test. [Exeunt L. and R. Enter Frau and Zoeline different ways. FRAU. Good morning, sir. ZOELINE. Good Frau, I give you greeting. FRAU. Young gentleman, I long have sought this meeting. Why don't you blush for shame? ZOELINE. Good Frau, in sooth, I have not blushed, I fear, since tender youth. You should be grateful; I have done my best To do the honours to your beauteous guest. FRAU. How kind you are! ZOELINE. The favour do not mention. FRAU. How dare you pay that bold-faced thing attention In my own houseâunder my very nose? ZOELINE. Well, under what's as redâunder the rose. FRAU. Insolent puppy! ZOELINE. Frau, I am not deaf, Your voice has reached a superhuman clef. Here comes your daughter, at the row alarmed. FRAU. You'll see me soon again. ZOELINE. I shall be charmed. [Enter Johanna and Elspeth. The click-clack of that tongue is past enduring. Oh, there's one voice so sweet and soul-alluring! JOHANNA. Dear Zoeline, I'm glad we've met again, We havn't had a chat I don't know when. Do you still care for me? ZOELINE. Yes, dear, you're right. [Aside.] I vow her walk is quite ungraceful! quite. JOHANNA. For months I've been so very sad and lonely, A heart-disease, and you're the doctor only. ZOELINE. Yes, Luralie. JOHANNA. My name's Johanna, sir! I wish you would not think so much of her. ZOELINE. Dearest Johanna! justly am I blamed. JOHANNA. If folks say true, you ought to be ashamed. What do you see in that fresh-water shark? ZOELINE. Well, now, there is not much in that remark. My Luralie some pretty speech had turned. ELSPETH. My mistress speaks. Where were your manners learned? ZOELINE. In looks they cannot be compared a minute, A gay young nightingale, and poor green linnet. ELSPETH. My mistress speaks to you. Come, Master Dapper, No matter who's your duck, I'm not your flapper. ZOELINE. Pardon, Johanna, pardon this abstraction. JOHANNA. Your meditations must have much attraction. You were not so abstracted, sir, before. I fear you think my company a bore. ZOELINE. Oh, not the least. [A low voice is heard singing outside. But stayâI beg your pardonâ Don't you hear someone singing in the garden? I have a small appointment for a while. [Aside.] Ah! she's without my charmer's brilliant smile. JOHANNA. Meanwhile I'll go and sit alone and cry. ZOELINE. Aye, doâI meanâI'll see you by and by. [Exit Zoeline. JOHANNA. 'Tis hard a girl should break her heart at twenty. Have you no comfort, Elspeth? ELSPETH. Madam, plenty. He is a puppy, impudent, and snobbish. How feel you, mistress dear? JOHANNA. Pretty bobbish. ELSPETH. Don't take on so; how pitiful you talk. If I'd my will, Miss Luralie should walk. I'd rather play the poor fool in the middle, Than in my father's house play second fiddle. To call her pretty: 'tis a public scandal; Why, ma'am, to you she couldn't hold a candle. JOHANNA. Why, yes, I must confess her eyes are fishy. ELSPETH. And her complexion, oh! so washy-wishy. Enter Luralie. LURALIE. My pretty Jezebel, what's that you said? JOHANNA. Come, Elspeth, not a word; we'll cut her dead. LURALIE. So sits the wind, how angrily you mutter, You must have quarrelled with your bread and butter. On such a lovely day, why look so cloudy? Has Frau Mamma been scolding,âthe old dowdy? Come, Fraulein, here's my handâforget all wrongs. ELSPETH. We wouldn't touch it with a pair of tongs. JOHANNA. Oh, Elspeth, don't;âI bear her no ill-will, Though you have ruined all my prospects,âstill. [She shakes hands with Luralie. LURALIE. Pray, Fraulein, can I help my own attraction? Why these reproaches? Can't you take an action? Some damages you might recover from us, If you make out a case of breach of promise. But don't blame meâwhat mischief have I done? You tried to win him,âswimmingly I won. To view it in a piscatorial light, I angled for him, and he took the bite. Safe in my meshes lies your brave knight-errant, While your slack lines are drifting in the current. [Sings to the air of âGin a body meet a body.â You have lost a gallant lover: Wooing me he came. If I have not chid the rover, Am I, ma'am, to blame? If I bad him welcome only, In a pretty song, When he found me sad and lonely, Am I in the wrong? If I took his hand and mildly Bade him not despair, When he vowed he loved me wildly; Call you this unfair? You have lost, &amp;c. &amp;c. JOHANNA sings. When you came stealing hope from my heart, Have I e'er blamed or bid you depart? When your cold hatred, smiling at face, Stung this poor heart in trustful embrace, Who was to blame? Yes, who was to blame? Who was the serpent that smilingly came? Who was to blame? Yes, who was to blame? For this stung heart, who's to blame? When the poor lapwing, flying alone, Pineth to find her nestlings are gone; Was the rude hand that wantonly came Stealing her darlingsâwas it to blame? Thus you're to blame,âyes, thus you're to blame; Yours was the rude hand that wantonly came. Thus you're to blame; thus you're to blame; For this robbed heart you're to blame. [Exeunt L. and R. Scene IV. âThe outside of the Castle; Wilhelm serenading with a fiddle. WILHELM. This is her window. All are still as mice. How beautiful is Elspethâyea, how nice! And, oh! her dimples, when they slyly come, Dear heart, they are enough to strike one dumb. In our short petticoats we were attached, And once I blubbered when her nose was scratched. I gave her all my gingerbread and candy, And one small lock of hair, so nice and sandy; But now she's been admired, and gone to service, She laughs at me, and makes me very nervous. In music, now, I'll tenderly upbraid her, And if my nerves permit I'll serenade her. This fiddle once, I'm told, I fingered neatly, And it discourses musicâvery sweetly. [Wilhelm sings; air, âSummer Nightâ (Don Pasquale.) Awake, my dear, I'm fiddling and shivering here; And fiddling and shivering here. Awake, my dear, and at the top window appear! [Window opens; Baron's head appears. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!â [Wilhelm hides. BARON. Bless me! I've always heard the place was haunted! Such frightful howlingânot that I am daunted. [Comes out on the stage. Some shocking stories I can recollect. 'Tis right we should be very circumspect; No doubt strange characters are now about, Such as my bumptious friend, Old Water-spout; And when such ugly customers are going, Who may pop in upon us there's no knowing. Hush!âhist! What voice was that? What sudden shade Popped out behind me? Bless me! Who's afraid? [Sees Wilhelm going off. Hullo! you thief! your swallow-tails I'll riddle. Here's a nice concert of a cat and fiddle. Ah! now I see it allâa pretty frolic. Bless me! the fright has given me the colic. Donner und blitzen! But he got a fright: He'll scarcely be in tune again to-night; I'll have a drop to warm my good old nose. Oh, my lumbago! Oh, my gouty toes! [Baron goes into the house; Wilhelm comes back. WILHELM. Alas! I'm in a tremble. It was frightful; And I was singing to her quite delightful! Perhaps 'twas fancy, only superstition, That hideous, wrinkled, bloated apparition. Oh, Elspeth! what I ventured for your sake! My gentle fiddle shall once more awake. [Wilhelm sings; air, âBuy a Broom.â I've come here to-night, dear, in pitiful plight, dear, Through danger and fright, dear, a singing to you. Elspeth appears at the window and sings. I'm sick of enduring your vile troubadouring, You don't look alluring. Poor sweetheart, adieu! Good-bye now. WILHELM. Don't fly now. ELSPETH. Good-bye now. WILHELM. Don't fly now. ELSPETH. (Duet.) The household you'll waken. Poor sweetheart, adieu. WILHELM. (Duet.) Don't leave me forsaken, a singing to you. Still fiddling I'll keep, dear; I'll sing you to sleep, dear; Till morning does peep, dear, I'll sing and I'll sigh. ELSPETH. Your sighs are no use, sir; you're not worth abuse, sir. Now, don't be a goose, sir. Poor sweetheart, good-bye. Good-bye now. WILHELM. Don't fly now. ELSPETH. Good-bye now. WILHELM. Don't fly now. ELSPETH. (Duet.) The household you'll waken. Poor sweetheart, adieu. WILHELM. (Duet.) Don't leave me forsaken, a singing to you. [Elspeth disappears; the door opens. Wilhelm rushes into the Baron's arms. BARON. Come, sir, give me up your fiddle, you made such a horrible rout You've given my wife the night-mare, and aggravated my gout. Enter Frau. FRAU. Good gracious me! why, Baron, what means this outlandish row? Come, wretch, give up your fiddle: I dreamed they were killing the sow. WILHELM. I can't give up my fiddle. Oh, pardon, good woman, I beg. FRAU. Yourself, young man, and your fiddle we'll certainly lower a peg. BARON. Begone, rash youth, forswear these mad night capers: Take your old fiddle, and take to your scrapers. FRAU. And if you can't resist your tuneful failing, You must reserve your music for the railing. [Exeunt L. and R. Scene V. âA Room in the Castle. Enter Johanna and Elspeth. JOHANNA. Quick! Father wants his lunchâdraw in the table; Make all as comfortable as we're able. Here is his meerschaum; place his gruel hereâ 'Tis good for gout. Oh, hide that jug of beer, And then, perhaps, he'd like to take a light nap; Shake up his pillowâwhere's his gown and night-cap? We'll sit with him, it will prevent me fretting. ELSPETH. You'll spoil him, ma'am, you'll ruin him with petting. JOHANNA. To please my father, could I do too much? ELSPETH. He comes! hark to the bumping of his crutch. Enter Baron. JOHANNA. Well, father dear, are you complaining still? BARON. Tut! child, I'm very cross and very illâ I'm off my oats. ELSPETH. This petulance give over; You're off your oats because you live in clover. Here is your luncheon, sir. JOHANNA. Elspeth, be quiet! BARON. What trash is that? What meagre prison diet? JOHANNA. 'Tis some nice gruel, father. BARON. Throw it out! JOHANNA. I only thought 'twas very good for gout. What would you wish, sir? BARON. I intend to lunch On devil'd kidneys and on brandy punch. They'd have me waste away on bread and water. ELSPETH. Fie! You're a pretty man to have a daughter. JOHANNA. Oh! ever thus from childhood was my fate! I don't know how I earned my father's hate. BARON (melting). I melt to tears. Poor goose! she looks so mild. Come here, my eldest-born and only child. JOHANNA. Dear Sir! I did my best to make you snug. BARON. You did, my offspring. Come, a filial hug. Bless you, my child, my little nurse you'll be. Sit on your cross old daddy's gouty knee; For though his aggravations are not small, He's not so bad a fellow after all. Enter Frau. FRAU. I've caught them at their sentimental chatter. BARON. Well, woman, well! you've caught us, and what matter? FRAU. I am not dreaming of you, old Stupidity. The time is come, we'll seize it with avidity. I've caught the gallant and that minx together, Enjoying quietly the summer weather; Walking there quietly, above all dodging, As if they had a right to board and lodging. Give me your arm, old man, till you behold herâ She'd feast on us, indeed. BARON. We'll give her the cold shoulder. [He hobbles out on Frau's arm. JOHANNA. Come, Elspeth, quick! we'll steal off softly now. ELSPETH. I go, although I'd like to see the row. [Exeunt. Enter Zoeline and Luralie, dogged by Baron and Frau. FRAU. There's impudence! Come, dear, just turn them out. Quick! Baron!âbe decisive. BARON. Oh my gout! FRAU. Why, Baron dear, I think you must be drunk. BARON. No, Frau, my darling, only in a funk. FRAU. Just have their luggage rolled off to the coach. BARON. That might be deemed a truc-ulent reproach. FRAU. My mouth is shut when I should furious be. BARON. I wish 'twas lock-jaw, and I had the key. FRAU. I really don't know how I was outwitted, But when 'twas I myself her stay permitted, I can't go back. BARON. You ought to be a dab At going back, like any sour old crab. FRAU (patting him on the shoulder). Baron! be at them like a dear old fellow. BARON. She's licking meâthe cobra di capello. FRAU. Be at them! See, they're looking at us now! GOBBET (starting out). Harroose, old Baron; Hi! Harroose, old Frau! [Gobbet hunts out Baron and Frau. ZOELINE. Dear Luralie, thus twine our hands together; Water or earth shall have no power to sever This hand from mine. LURALIE. Water! Art thou in earnest? I fear thou'lt waver when the truth thou learnest. Yet I would question thee. ZOELINE. Come, love, begin. LURALIE. You're webbed, of course, and have a dorsal fin. ZOELINE. Yesâand a little tail that's scarcely grown. LURALIE. Well, sir, you swim, of course, like anyâ ZOELINE. Stone! LURALIE. Pray can you dive when wind and wave are driving? ZOELINE. Out of my depth my tendency is diving, Though from a child I've lived a dip detesting. LURALIE. Ah, Zoeline! do stop this dreadful jesting, Now, should you wed the Rhine King's beauteous daughter, How long, perhaps, could you stay under waterâ Beneath the lovely Rhine, now, were you in it? ZOELINE. Well, let me seeâsuppose we say a minute. LURALIE. No longer? ZOELINE. Well, I shouldn't mind the soaking. But I'm peculiarly averse to choking. What's this? In tears! Your meaning I would construe. LURALIE. But I will weep! Don't comfort me, you monster. 'Tis little that you care about my wishes, And won't come down to see the pretty fishes. [Sings; air, âCome to my gipsy home.â Come to my water home, lover of mineâ Down in a sparry cave under the Rhine: There shall you dream away ages of love, Lulled by the drowsy waves fathoms above; White nymphs shall wait on us, gliding aroundâ Gliding in time to the wave's drowsy sound. There shall I sing as you slumber the while, And you shall dream in the light of my smile. Voices are calling us, spirit-like sound Softly is weaving enchantments around. Come to my water home, lover of mine, Down in a sparry cave under the Rhine. ZOELINE (much moved). I yield, I go; these words my soul environ; I rush to take the fatal plunge, my Siren; The Rhine King beckons us with osier truncheon. I goâbut first I think we'll order luncheon. Ho! Gobbet! GOBBET. Here, sir. ZOELINE. I was near forgetting We'd want a stimulant before the wetting. [Gobbet brings wine. ZOELINE. Here's good old Rhenish, and no flavour finer: A goblet fill up. GOBBET. In a fillup, Mein Herr. ZOELINE. Stay, for your mistress first a goblet fill. LURALIE. Pure water be it, and about a gill. To-morrow evening, when the moon is up, You'll find a magic ring within this cup; Then, if you really love me, do not linger, But place the ring upon your marriage finger, And hasten to the shore, where rustling sedges And tiny ripples glance with silver edges; Where reeds and osiers in the breeze are swinging, You'll find me combing my long hair, and singing. But first,âanoint your body with this ointment; 'Twill make you water-proof,âkeep your appointment. ZOELINE. Farewell! my ardent love at nothing quails. [Exit Luralie. GOBBET. That stuff will make him all break out in scales. ZOELINE sings. Yes, I believe thee, whate'er may betide me; Thy music is round me, its cadence shall guide me; I'll sleep, and thy form shall be kneeling beside me, My cold hand be clasping in thine. Thus let me sleepâah! how calmly reclining, As o'er me the stars from thy soft lids keep shining, For ever, for ever in lonely endeavour To lighten the darkness of mine. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA Room in the Castle. Luralie alone. LURALIE. My summer holidays are nearly over: I've roved enough to love to be a rover; But I have won him, and before I go Must suit him to our water home below. That ointment, deadly to all water vermin, Will change my lover to a gallant merman, With webs and scales, and horny, lizard tail, So curled and greenâa lovely coat of mail. This ugly crisis keeps me in the fidgets. How will he feel with webs between his digits? Will scales and lizard tail appear alarming? Will he be shocked at what I think so charming? This morning I was mischievous and merry; My heart danced lightly, like a trim-built wherry; But now a cloud so black, it makes me shiver, Comes flitting o'er my bosom's sunny river, As in a magic crystal I can see Some hurricane approach. Ah! woe is me! Enter Wizard disguised as a beggar. WIZARD. I am uncertain how I shall accost her. LURALIE. I know you well, you funny old impostor. WIZARD. Fair one, mistaken you might chance to be. LURALIE (mimicking him). Nay, never wag your goatish beard at me. WIZARD. Madam, you're merry, but I know you not. The merest chance has brought me to this spot; A poor old beggar, spent with hunger's qualms, Who likes a joke, but far prefers an alms. LURALIE. I see, and so by merest chance you came; Perhaps you'd make your exit by the same. WIZARD. Then be it so. On purpose I am here. It seems thou knowest me,âthou shalt learn to fear. Would'st thou illude the Wizard's piercing sight? At this dread sign unmask thee, Water Sprite! [Waves his wandâthrows off his disguise. LURALIE. Dear, picturesque old creature, don't be furious! Oh, what a lovely beard! so soft and curious; 'Twould be such fun in two great rolls to plait it, A waterfall of beard!ânow might I pat it? [She strokes Wizard's beard. WIZARD. No siren art my settled purpose staggers. LURALIE. There is no need, dear sir, of looking daggers. WIZARD. Spirit, attend! Unbending I proceed. LURALIE. Are you so stern and pitiless indeed? WIZARD. If I relax my brow at your contrition, Charge it to pity, not to indecision. Long hast thou fooled it, all my magic scorning. Ere you proceed, accept a solemn warning: If on yon youth thou shalt exert thy malice To lure him to thy father's fatal palace, Enchanting him with thy allurements hollow, I tell thee, nymph, dread punishment shall follow. 'Tis writ within my volume's clasped pagesâ Eternal anguish, or a sleep for ages; But to induce thee to withdraw thy charms To thy late home, and to thy father's arms, The sparry vaulted caves thou shalt behold, See on yon mists the magic scene unrolled. [Tableau of Luralie's home. Solemn music. So, fade!âTake care;âthou'rt warned, howe'er it be. Adieuâadieuâadieu! Remember me! [Exeunt L. and R. Enter Johanna and Elspeth. JOHANNA. I'm sick of sighing, broken-hearted nearly. He surely treats me very cavalierly. [Hands Elspeth a dagger. Just take this dagger;âTo my bosom's centre Strike home, dear Elspeth, till the daylight enter! ELSPETH. The daylight enter!âMistress, you're insane! Remember daylight enters through a pain. We'll first kill time, dear mistress, if we can. Here comes my sweetheart! Such a funny man. [Enter Wilhelm. You come, young man, as usual in the flurries, A teazing cur. JOHANNA. Oh! you're the lamb he worries. WILHELM. I am offended by such cruel dealings; In fact, I'm overpowered with my feelings. Sweet girl, we'd live together very snugly If you would have me. ELSPETH. Why, you are so ugly! WILHELM. I know my face isâ ELSPETH. Like a buttered muffin. WILHELM. I know I am a goose. [Sighs audibly. ELSPETH. You seem to be a puffin. WILHELM. Of a small house I have a lease for life. Oh, be my husband; let me be your wife. Two cows do browse an acre and a half. ELSPETH. And of which cow are you the happy calf? WILHELM (to Johanna). Do, pretty, sweet young woman, help me if you can. JOHANNA. Oh, take him, Elspeth, such a nice young man. A lovely Roman nose and larking eye, And I am sure he's nearly six feet high. WILHELM sings; air, âMary Blane.â This morning to a barber's shop To trim my hair I went; And on this handsome suit of clothes A lot of money spent. But now, of all the pride I felt In these nankeens, you rob My wretched heartâI feel as if They were not worth a bob. I'll just go home, and round my neck A true love knot I'll tie, And then I'll climb a lamp-post rung And hang until I die. And some dark night, when you are tripping Homeward in the damp, You'll see my poor long helpless legs A dangling from a lamp. ELSPETH sings; air, âTrab, trab.â Here let this folly end, sir, I told you so before; I like you as a friend, sir, But, thank you, nothing more. Perhaps if you should die, sir, I'd wish you back again, And may be I might cry, sir; But you must wait till then. And may be, &amp;c. Were I your little mate, sir, When you had time to cool, You find me out, when late, sir, A shrewish little fool. If you should like to come, sir, To see me now and then, I'll always be at home, sir; But talk no love again. I'll always, &amp;c. [Exeunt. Enter Zoeline with a glass, applying ointment to his face. ZOELINE. Now I am water-proof. My fears I can't o'ermaster, I feel all over like a mild pitch plaster. What am I tempted to? Yet I can't doubt her, 'Tis my disease that I can't live without her. I would be curedâthis step is dangerous, sure, And oft is fatalâthe cold-water cure. [Looks at a pocket glass. I'm glad to see my face, it does not soil. Pah! it savours strongly of cod's liver oil. I need not rub my eyebrows, I suppose. Now for my chin; now I'll touch up my nose. Enter Johanna. JOHANNA. Well, Zoeline, to you I am most grateful, I'm rid of that strange girl, so cold and hateful; She went this morning to the Rhine, they say, And brought her robes and ornaments away. I know this happy change to you is owingâ What are you doing? Whither are you going? ZOELINE. To marry Luralie. Ha, ha! excuse this laughter; I thought you'd like to throw the slipper after. Now don't expostulateâno use in sorrow; I'm sworn to marry Luralie to-morrow. JOHANNA sings. Faithless, faithless, I was once your idol: One short month would have dawned upon our bridal; But before that time was over, Zoeline, Zoeline, you left me for another. ZOELINE sings. Ah! poor girl, 'tis most distressing, Most sincerely I deplore That, you're charming still confessing, Other charms must I adore. [Johanna and Zoeline sing together. JOHANNA. Zoeline, oh, Zoeline, I love none but thee, Zoeline; No other claims one thought of mine. I love none but thee Zoeline. ZOELINE. Luralie, oh, Luralie, I love none but thee, Luralie; No other can I hear or see. I love none but thee, Luralie. JOHANNA sings. Think of the Baron's broken-hearted daughter, Think of the plunge in the cold and sullen water. May it haunt youâmay it daunt you, ZoelineâZoelineâtraitor and deceiver! [Exit. Scene II. âThe Rhine. Gobbet alone. GOBBET. Now is the winter of my mud-born meanness, Made glorious summer by these people's greenness; And now, instead of diving for my meals, To fright the timid souls of river eels, And scarcely venturing to bask on shore, But on a sunny mud-bank grunt and snore, I drink good beer from foaming pewter mugs, And sleep in feather-beds, full of nice things called b?gs! Now for my dinner,âwhat a jolly mess, That never wanted cook or fire to dress: A springing salmon, which I caught myself; I'll eat it like a Christian, too, on delf. [Eats at one side of the stage. Enter Johanna and Elspeth. ELSPETH. What would you be a doing, mistress dear? JOHANNA. I come to drown myself and sorrows here. ELSPETH. You're in your slippered feetâdear mistress, holdâ Do take my shoes, you'll get your death of cold! Your foot's almost as small as Cinderella, And, ma'am, why havn't you got your umbrella? The rain, like rats and mice, is pouring down: Oh! 'tis a very ugly night to drown! JOHANNA. What nonsense you are talking! What care I For rain and cold when I am going to die? ELSPETH. Such folly, mistress dear, ain't you above? JOHANNA. Sure, didn't Dido kill herself for love? ELSPETH. Dido! she darned her stocking as she sat, Before the palace gate she darn't do that. JOHANNA. Here, take my brooch and earringsâyou may sell them. If friends should come to look for me, you'll tell them They'll find me on the mud-bank down below: And then âtake me up tenderly,â don't you know? [Sings; air, Donna Sabina Waltz. Johanna sings No more hope flushes me, Frantic I go, Where old Rhine hushes me Moaning low. Thereâthere grief preyeth not, Wasteth not more, And old Rhine stayeth not Rushing o'er. ELSPETH sings. Oh, speak to me mildly, You're staring so wildly, Your face is so white, dear! I'm trembling with fright, dear. Oh, Fraulein! dear Fraulein! 'tis fatal, this sadness! Oh, Fraulein! dear Fraulein! your meaning is madness! You look so despairing, So vacantly staring! I'm all in a tremble; A ghost you resemble. Oh, Fraulein! dear Fraulein! your meaning is madness! Oh, Fraulein! dear Fraulein! what mean you to do? JOHANNA sings. I stay not to ponder, my grave waits me yonder: To brood in my sorrows one moment I dare not; Till soundly I slumber, each moment I number, I fly from my anguish, and whither I care not. No more hope flushes me, &amp;c. JOHANNA (to Elspeth). I know you won't forget my dying wishes: Now, cruel Zoeline, I'm food for fishes. [She iumps into the Rhine. ELSPETH. And so she's drowned herself, and so I let her; I greatly fear I'm aider and abetier. What noise is that? it frightened me almost. Alas! alas! it is the Fraulein's ghost! [She runs off the stage. GOBBET. Though reptile I, she nearly made me blubber. Here's for a plunge, to save this poor land lubber. [Gobbet dives in after Johanna. Enter Zoeline, all covered with scales. ZOELINE. Oh, horror! beating every horror hollow! May the earth open and my body swallow. I dreamed that to a mermaid I was married, And to the Rhine in clammy arms was carried; I dreamed the monster struck me with her tail, And all my skin broke out in slimy scale. Johanna now would loathe me with disgust, I'll fling me at her feetâI mustâI must. [Exit Zoeline. Enter Johanna and Elspeth. ELSPETH. It was some crazy door that was a creaking, JOHANNA. For shameâthe voice was tuneful that was speaking. I should not now be sorrowful and weeping, If on the peaceful mud-bank I was sleeping; It's not so very terrible to drown, And I was goingâoh, so calmly down, When something seized on my unhappy corpus, Some kind Newfoundland, or a gentle porpoise, And brought me softly paddling to the shore. ZOELINE (outside). Oh, Johanna! ELSPETH. Hush, mistressâthere again, the creaking door. Enter Zoeline. JOHANNA. Oh, Zoeline! ZOELINE. That's me. JOHANNA. Oh, pardon my surprise! What means that fishy look about your eyes? Has some bad spirit your resemblance stole? Or is it transmigration of the soul? I knew your voice, and hastened to the place, But scarcely can I recognise your face. What have you done, that could have changed you so? ZOELINE. I am a crocodile, for all I know; And yet no crocodile's tears are those I'm shedding. JOHANNA. This should have been the morning of our wedding. ZOELINE. My wedding! name it not, I almost deem Some charm was over me, some frightful dreamâ Some spell that bound me to the cold deceiver; 'Tis gone, just likeâthe night-mare of a fever, And left my heart as once it was, thine own. What say Iâcan a reptile's tears atone? JOHANNA. To wed that reptile is my dearest wish. Give me your handâ[drops it]âhow clammy, like a fish. Pardon me, Zoeline! this is, indeed, felicity; The shock I felt must have been Electricity. I'm happier than the Queen of England now,â And who knows but you'll some day cast your slough? ZOELINE. Dearest Johanna! JOHANNA. Yes, what would you say? ZOELINE. You know this should have been my wedding day. I am so hideous, may be you might falter, And I'm so altered, you might slum the altarâ My reptile face. JOHANNA. Dear Zoeline, no more. I think it's twice as handsome as before. ELSPETH. Then what must it have been? Oh, how she doats! I think he'd frighten horses from their oats. ZOELINE. This generosity I can't repay: Oh, let this really be our bridal day. JOHANNA. With all my heart; dear Zoeline, content; But shall we ever get Mamma's consent? ELSPETH. Into the balance throw his money bales, And I'll go bail 'twill amply poise the scales. JOHANNA. Come, Zoeline, we'll go together now, And delicately break it to the Frau. Zoeline sings; air, Immortellen Waltz. True, still true, faithful are you; When all my summer friends left me You should have left me too. JOHANNA sings. Still by your side, though all others should leave you; Still when the traitor had snared and undone you; Proving my constancy, proud to have won you, Still is my cheering voice heard by your side. Duet. JOHANNA. True, still true, Faithful to you; When all your summer friends leave you, Let them desert me too. ZOELINE. True, still true, Faithful are you; When all my summer friends left me, You should have left me too. [Exeunt. Enter Luralie in agitation. LURALIE. I've had a dreamâa terrible dream. I thought I heard my old father call, And his gruff old voice had a threatening tone, As it thundered up from his sparry hall; Thro' Rhine's blue bosom, cold and deep, I thought I sunk, like a falling star, Where the light of the sun could hardly peep, Till it greenly glimmered in caves of spar, Where the Rhine's green hair kept waving, waving, And its silent waters were ever laving. My ears were confused by a gurgling sound; The light was dim as when evening closes, And the goggle-eyed fishes kept prying around, And bobbing against me with cold clammy noses. I longed for the cheery voices of men, The joyous hunt, and the thoughtless wassail; I longed for the light of the sun again, The gay greenwood, and the old grey castle. But the Rhine's green hair kept waving, waving, And its silent waters were ever laving. What did I hear in the dancing waves? My gay young bridegroom, I heard him greet me. What did I see in the sparry caves? My gay young bridegroom, I saw him meet me. âLuralie, long have I waited,â he said. But I sprang with a shriek from his clammy caresses;â My stern old father was there instead, And his temples were bound with the Rhine's green tresses, And the Rhine's green hair kept waving, waving, And the silent waters were ever laving. Enter Rhine King and Nymphs. RHINE KING. This is the period that I did appoint thee. Come! rush to my bosom! LURALIE. Dread vision, aroint thee! RHINE KING. My power is upon thee, and thou must return. Come, haste to the waterâI burn! I burn! The tide-wave is rolling, the stars are propitious,â The sign of the Scales, and the sign of the Fishes. RHINE KING sings. Haste away! haste away! Long have I wandered thro' my lonely halls. Haste away! haste away! Hark! 'tis the Rhine King calls! LURALIE sings. Oh, father! bide one falling tideâ The weary waves to seaward glide. Alas! I cannot, cannot, leave himâleave my Zoeline! CHORUS OF NYMPHS. List to our murmuring chorus! It thrills through the water o'er us. Oh, come, sister! dearest Luralie! Oh, dearest Luralie! Come! we are worn with weeping;â Our hearts lonely watch are keeping. Oh, come, sister! dearest Luralie! Oh, dearest Luralie! RHINE KING sings. Haste away! haste away! Long have I wandered thro' my lonely halls. Haste away! haste away! Hark! 'tis the Rhine King calls. LURALIE sings. Oh, father! bide on falling tideâ The weary waves to seaward glide. Alas! I cannot, cannot leave himâleave my Zoeline! CHORUS OF NYMPHS. Lo, thro' the waters gleaming, Our long robes and tresses streamingâ Oh, come, sister! dearest Luralie! Oh, dearest Luralie! List to thy sisters' calling; Our wail on thine ear is fallingâ Oh, come, sister! dearest Luralie! dearest Luralie! RHINE KING. Thy chamber awaits theeâall starry and pure: Thy lamp shall be made of a great Koh-i-noor. We have banished all things that are slimy and ragged; Thy floor shall be coral, thy throne shall be agate, Thy crown of the wet water-lily and dry rush, All clustered with diamonds (the diamonds are Irish); And a robe of ice buglesâits tissue is thinnish; 'Twas completed in Finland with exquisite finish. NYMPH. Behind thee, sister, see a sunny scene wake. The spotted trout are jumping at the green drake; Your own pet trout has spent itself in leaping Above the current when it saw you weeping. LURALIE. Alas! What noise! What mean these acclamations? RHINE KING. Thy Zoeline is false. NYMPH. Sister, have patience. Don't list to the rejoicings of the vain crowd; Come, take a shower-bath in yonder rain cloud. LURALIE. Father, I comeâdear sisters, do not cry; My heart's best life's water is nearly dry. Lull me to sleep with music below, I'll slumber for a century or so. When I awakeâfor time our grief assuagesâ We'll find ourselves about the middle ages. Father, permit meâyou can vigil keep: You know I'm best behaved when I'm asleep; You'll see, by peeping downwards thro' the skylight, My misty figure in the caves' green twilight, A dreaming of the billows' distant plashes, All in my clouds of air and long eyelashes. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Room in the Castle. Enter Baron and Frau, with an immense bill of items, that drags along the floor. FRAU. Now, sir, that she is gone, that nasty viper, We've had our fun, pray who's to pay the piper? Here is an awful bill from the upholsters. BARON. Is there an item touching these two bolsters? [Points to his legs. FRAU. The butcher's bill. BARON. No moreâthe bill's a true one. FRAU. The bill for wine. BARON. 'Tis mighty like blue ruin. FRAU. The bill for plate. BARON. Includes your ugly mug. FRAU. The bill for ale. BARON. Will put me in jug. FRAU. The bill for trinkets, gewgaws, lace, and rings. BARON. One yetâI'll see no more of Banquo's Kings! Enter Johanna, Zoeline in scales, and Elspeth. ZOELINE. I come, good Frau, my humble suit renewing. FRAU. Pray, sir, are you the frog that went a wooing? JOHANNA. Dear mother, do not thus your son abash: Father, it merely is a trifling rash. ZOELINE. I got it eating lobsters and red pepper. BARON. That's fine bounceâyou seem to be a leper. Enter Wizard. WIZARD. I am a man, born of a former race: My peers are dead, forget my name and place; But kindly sympathy, age can't erase. Friends, I perceive your sad misfortunes clearly. Alas, poor youth! I pity you sincerely. But that you suffered this disgrace was better, That from your heart might fall her magic fetter. 'Tis true I can't with pharmaceutic skill Compound the famous âAnti-Scaly-Pill,â The fame of which, if Holloway but hears, He'll set the public papers by the ears. But I can summon from the vasty deep An able leech. Ho! Gobbet, start from sleep! GOBBET. Here! mighty master,âsay what is your will. WIZARD. Produce the famous âAnti-Scaly-Pill,â And heal this youth, quick, fugit atra cura, I'll then disclose my camera obscura. GOBBET. Bid us all hail,âI am a potent wizard; You are my subject, now that you're a lizard. However, we regard you with good will, And gift you with the âAnti-Scaly-Pill.â JOHANNA. The âAnti-Scaly-Pill,ââthe name is funny. ELSPETH. Comfort yourselves, it is not anti-money. GOBBET (to Baron and Frau). Permit their union,âlet your squabbles end. BARON. And who are you, my most ingenious friend? GOBBET. I am the potentate of slugs and snails, And all amphibious creatures telling tales; Also of bats, and rats, and toads, and frogs, The Emperor of half a million bogs. BARON. Most potent Majesty, pray turn about. [Kicks him. Exit Gobbet. Ho, I declare, the dog has cured my gout. ZOELINE. And cured my scales. My fortune is my face. Johanna, lo! BARON. Oh, you have changed the case. FRAU. Dear son-in-law, I greet you with a kiss. ZOELINE. Oh, that will do. FRAU (kissing him). Take thisâand thisâand this. BARON. Of course, young man, the fortune's to the fore. ZOELINE. I give her all I have, I can no more. And you, too, will be generous, no doubt. What's Fraulein's dowry, Baron? BARON. Oh, my gout! Enter Wilhelm, who kneels to Frau in mistake for Elspeth. WILHELM. Forgive me, beauteous maid! FRAU. Baronâpreserve us! WILHELM. I couldn't hang myself, I got so nervous. Oh! an old woman! Oh, I never knew her! BARON. I say, young man, you're very welcome to her. WILHELM. Oh, no! My head goes round, my stomach sickens. BARON. Try herâshe is the tenderest of chickens. FRAU. Baron, avenge me, and this ruffian shoot; [Takes him by the hair. I never saw such a ferocious brute. WILHELM. Let go my hair, I'll give you such a digging. BARON. I knew the poor young man would get a wigging. ELSPETH. Good Frau, forgive the poor dear creatureâlook you, For your most humble servant he mistook you. The blunder's natural, for, to be truthful, Our figures are alikeâwe both are youthful. I've seen so much of true love's sorrows lately, [To Wilhelm. That I quite pity you, and like you greatly. In fact, unless my mistress is averse, I'll take you, sir, for better or for worse. BARON. Well done, old boys and girlsâno more caressing, You all shall have my patriarchal blessing. [Takes Zoeline aside. Now, my gay bridegroom, take this counsel trusty: Poison your wife when she gets old and crusty. ELSPETH. Poor heart! when an old husband's gout and growls have broke it. FRAU. Ha! Baron,âput that in your pipe and smoke it. WIZARD. You now shall see secure your late tormentor Asleep for ages in the Rhine's green centre. There shall she lie till centuries revolve. Ye mists that dim the mortal eye, dissolve! Tableau of Luralie asleep, the Rhine King and Nymphs standing round her. RHINE KING sings. I am franticâgrief gigantic Harroweth this mighty heaving breast with care. Pangs tremendous of anguish rend us. Lo! how we tear our hoary hair! CHORUS OF NYMPHS. Ah! she sleeps at last. From our brows we cast Wreath and flower above herâproving how we love her. Let us float around, till the spell of sound Falls on her heart like balm. RHINE KING sings. Hush this groaning, she is moaning. Would you scare her slumbers with a funeral strain? With glad measure, lull my treasure: Come, soothe with joyful dreams her pain. CHORUS OF NYMPHS. Ah! howe'er we will, comes a wailing thrill, Mingling with her slumbers Sad despairing numbers. Yet we bid thee sleep. Be thy slumbers deepâ Sleep till thy heart be calm. BARON and FRAU sing. How romanticâcut an antic. We behold our hateful foe in limbo there! Thanks tremendous! Still defend us From sprites of water and of air. CHORUS OF ALL ON THE STAGE. Chant a bridal song, as we march along; Maidens trip with slim toe, Luralie's in limbo! Thank our hoary friend, with a courteous bend; Thanks, potent, hoary sage. General Chorus. RHINE KING sings. I am franticâgrief gigantic Harroweth this mighty heaving breast with care. Pangs tremendous of anguish rend us. Lo! how we tear our hoary hair! BARON and FRAU sing. How romanticâcut an antic. Behold our hateful foe in limbo there! Thanks tremendous! Still defend us From sprites of water and of air. CHORUS OF NYMPHS. He is franticâgrief gigantic Harroweth his mighty heaving breast within. Pangs tremendous of anguish rend usâ See how he tears his hoary hair! ELSPETH comes forward. I come to ask your votes for us, Most kind and patient friends. You've had enough of us, perhaps You're glad the business ends. And if you've had a crow to pick, No doubt there has been caws; But drown the sounds of censure In your generous applause. [Curtain falls. END OF âLURALIE.â</field>
