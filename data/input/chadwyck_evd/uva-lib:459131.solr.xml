      <field name="fulltext">Enter Sir Francis Ilford, Wentloe, and Bartley. Bart. Bvt Francke, Franke, now we are come to the house, what shall we make to be our busines? Ilford. Tut, let vs be Impudent enough, and good inough. Went. We haue no acquaintaince heere, but young Scarborrow. Ilf. How no aquaintance: Angels guard me from thy company. I tel thee Wentloe thou art not worthy to weare guilte Spurs, cleane Linnen, nor good Cloaths. Went. Why for Gods sake? Ilford. By this hand thou art not a man fit to Table at an Ordinary, keepe Knights company to Bawdy houses, nor Begger thy Taylor. Went. Why then I am free from Cheaters, cleare from the Pox, and escape Cursses? Ilf. Why doost thou think there is any Christians in the world? Went. I and Iewes too, Brokers, Puritans, and Sergiants. Ilf. Or doost thou meane to begge after Charity, that goes in a cold sute already, that thou talkest thou hast no acquaintance here. I tel thee Wentlee thou canst not liue on this side of the world: feed wel, drink Tobacco, and be honored into the presence, but thou must be acquainted with all sortes of men, I and so farre in to, till they desire to be more acquainted with thee. Bart. True, and then you shall be accompted a gallant of good credit. Enter Clowne. Ilf. But stay, here is a Scrape-trencher ariued: How now blew bottle, are you of the house? Clow. I haue heard of many blacke Iacks Sir, but neuer of a blew Bottle. Ilf. Well Sir, are you of the house? Clow. No Sir, I am twenty yardes without, and the house stands without me. Bart. Prethee tels who owes this building. Clow. He that dwels in it Sir. Ilf. Who dwels in it then. Clow. He that owes it. Ilf. Whats his name. Clow. I was none of his God-father. Ilf. Dus maister Scarberow lie heere, Clow. Ile giue you a rime for that Sir, Sicke men may lie, and dead men in their Graues, Few else do lie abed at noone, but Drunkards, Punks, &amp; knaues. Ilf. What am I the better for thy answer? Clow. What am I the better for thy question? Ilf. Why nothing. Clow. Why then of nothing comes nothing. Enter Scarborrow. Went. Sblud this is a philosophicall foole. Clow. Then I that am a foole by Art, am better then you that are fooles by nature. Exit Scar. Gentlemen, welcome to Yorkshire. Ilf. And well incountred my little Villaine of fifteene hundred a yeare, Sfut what makest thou heere in this barren soyle of the North, when thy honest friends misse thee at London? Scar. Faith Gallants tis the Countrey where my Father liued, where first I saw the light, and where I am loved, Ilf. Lou'd, I as Courtiers loue Vsurers, &amp; that is iust as long as they lend them mony. Now dare I lay. Went. None of your Land good Knight, for that is laid to morgage already? Ilf. I dare lay with any man that will take me vp. Went. Who list to haue a Lubberly load. Ilf. Sirrah wag, this Rogue was son and heire to Antony Nowe, Now, and Blind Moone. And he must needs be a scuruy Musition, that hath two Fidlers to his Fathers: but tel me infayth, art thou not, nay I know thou art cald down into the country here, by some hoary Knight or other, who knowing thee a young Gentleman of good parts, and a great liuing, hath desired thee to see some pittifull peece of his Workemanship, a Daughter I meane, Ist not, so? Scar. About some such preferment I came downe. Ilf. Preferment, a good word: And when do you commence into the Cuckolds order, the Preferment you speak of when shal we haue Gloues: when, when? Scarb. Faith gallants I haue bin guest here but since last night. Ilf. Why, and that is time enough to make vp a dozen marriages, as marriages are made vp now adayes. For looke you Sir: the father according to the fashion, being sure you haue a good liuing, and without Incumbrance, comes to you thus:âtakes you by the hand thus:âwipes his long beard thus:âor turn svp his Muchacho thus:âWalks some turne or two thus:âto shew his comely Grauity thus:âAnd hauing washt his foule mouth thus:âit last breaksout thus.â Went. O God: Let vs heare more of this? Ilf. Maister Scarborrow, you are a young Gentleman, I knew your father well, hee was my worshipfull good Neighbour, for our Demeanes lay neare together. Then Sir,âyou and I must be of more nere acquaintance.âAt which, you must make an eruption thus:âO God (sweet Sir) Bart. Sfut, the Knight would haue made an excellent Zany, in an Italian Comedy. Ilf. Then hee goes forward thus: Sir, my selfe am Lord of some thousand a yeere, a Widdower, (maister Scarberrow) I haue a couple of young Gentlewomen to my Daughters, a thousand ayeare will do well deuided among them? Ha, wilt not Maister Scarborrow, âAt which you out of your education must reply thus.âThe Portion will deserue them worthy husbands: on which Tinder he soones takes fire and sweares you are the Man his hopes shot at, and one of them shall be yours. Went. If I did not like her, shoulde hee sweare to the diuell, I would make him forsworne. Ilf. Then putting you and the young Puggs to in a close roome together. Went. If he should lie with her there, is not the father partly the Bawd? Ilf. Where the young puppet, hauing the Lesson before from old Fox, giue the sonne halfe a dozen warme kisses, which after her fathers oths, takes such Impression in thee, thou straight ealst by Iesu Mistris, I loue you:âWhen shee has the wit to aske, but Sir, will you marry me, and thou in thy Cox-sparrow-humor replyest, I (before God) as I am a Gentleman wil I, which the Father ouer-hearing, leaps in, takes you at your word, sweares hee is glad to see this; nay he will haue you contracted straight, and for a need makes the priest of himselfe. Thus in one houre, from a quiet life, Thou art sworne in debt, and troubled with a wife. Bart. But can they Loue one another so soone? Ilf. Oh, it is no matter now adaies for loue, tis wel, and they can but make shift to lie together. Went. But will your father doe this too, if hee know the gallant breaths himselfe at some two or three Bawdy houses in a morning. Ilf. Oh the sooner, for that and the Land together, tell the olde ladde, he will know the better how to deale with his Daughter? The Wise and Auncient Fathers know this Rule, Should both wed Maids, the Child would be a Foole. Come Wag, if thou hast gone no further then into the Ordinarie fashion, meete, see, and kisse, giue ouer: Mary not a Wife to haue a hundred plagues for one pleasure: lets to London, theres variety: and change of pasture makes fat Calues. Sca. But change of women bawld Knaues, Sir Knight. Ilf. Wag and thou beest a Louer but three dayes, thou wilt hee Hartles, Sleeplesse, witles, Mad, Wretched, Miserable, and indeed, a starke Foole. And by that, thou hast beene married but three weekes, tho thou shouldst wed a Cynthia rara avis, thou wouldest be a man monstrous: A Cuckold, a Cuckold. Bart. And why is a Cuckold monstrous, Knight? Ilf. Why, because a man is made a Beast by being married? Take but example thy selfe from the Moone, as soone as shee is deliuered of her great belly, doth she not poynt at the world with a payre of hornes, as who should say, married men, some of ye are Cuckolds. Scar. I conster more Diuinely of their sex, Being Maids, methinkes they are Angels: and being Wiues, They are Soueraignes: Cordials that preserue our Liues, They are like our hands that feed vs, this is cleare, They renew man, as spring renewes the yeare. Ilf. Theres nere a wanton Wench that heares thee, but thinkes thee a Coxcom for saying so: Marry none of them, if thou wilte haue their true Characters. Ile giue it thee,âWomen are the Purgatory of mens Pursses, the Paradice of their bodies, and the Hel of their mindes; Marry none of them. Women are in Churches Saints, abroad Angels, at home Diuels. Here are married men inow, know this: Marry none of them. Scar. Men that traduce by custome, shew sharpe wit Onely in speaking Ill, and practise it: Against the best of Creatures, deuine women Who are Gods Agents heere, and the Heauenly eye By which this Orbe hath her Maturity; Beauty in women, get the world with Child, Without whom, she were barren, faint, and wilde. They are the stems on which do Angels grow, From whence Vertue is stild, and Arts do flow. Enter Sir Iohn Harcop and his Daughter Clare. Ilf. Let them be what Flowers they will, and they were Roses, I will plucke none of them for pricking my fingers. But soft, heere comes a voider for vs: and I see, do what I can, as long as the world lasts, there wil be Cuckolds in it. Do you heare Childe, heeres one come to blend you together: he has brought you a kneading-tub, if thou dost take her at his hands, Tho thou hadst Argus eyes, be sure of this, Women haue sworne with more then one to kisse. Har. Nay no parting Gentlemen: Hem. Went. Sfut dus he make Punkes of vs, that he Hems already? Har. Gallants, Know old Iohn Harcop keepes a Wineseller, Has Traueld, bin at Court, knowne Fashions, And vnto all beares habit like your selues, The shapes of Gentlemen and men of sort. I haue a health to giue them ere they part. Went. Health Knight, not as Drunkards giue their healthes I hope, to go together by the eares when they haue done? Har. My healths are welcome: welcome Gentlemen. Ilf. Are we welcome Knight, Infayth. Har. Welcome infayth Sir. Ilf. Preethee tell me hast not thou bin a Whoremaisler. Har. In youth I swild my fill at Venus cup, In sted of full draughts now I am faine to sup. Ilf. Why then thou art a man fit for my company: Doost thou heare that he is a good fellow of our stampe, Make much of his father. Exeunt Manet Scarborrow and Clare. Scar. The Father, and the Gallants haue left mee heare with a Gentlewoman, and if I know what to say to her I am a villen, heauen grant her life hath borrowed so much Impudence of her sex, but to speak to me first: for by this hand, I haue not so much steel of Immodesty in my face, to Parle to a Wench without blushing. Ile walke by her, in hope shee can open her teeth.âNot a word?âIs it not strange a man should be in a womans company all this while and not heare her tongue.âIle goe further? âGod of his goodnes: not a Sillable. I think if I should ake vp her Cloaths to, she would say nothing to me.âWith what words tro dus a man begin to woe. Gentlewoman pray you what Ist a Clocke? Clar. Troth Sir, carrying no watch about me but mine eyes, I answer you: I cannot tell. Scar. And if you cannot tell, Beauty I take the Addage for my reply: You are naught to keepe sheepe. Clar. Yet I am big enough to keepe my selfe. Scar. Prethee tell me: Are you not a Woman? Clar. I know not that neither, til I am better acquainted with a man. Scar. And how would you be acquainted with a man? Clar. To distinguish betwixt himselfe and my selfe. Scar. Why I am a Man. Cla. Thats more then I know Sir. Scar. To approue I am no lesse: thus I kisse thee. Cla. And by that proofe I am a man too, for I haue kist you. Scar. Prethee tell me can you loue? Clar. O Lorde Sir, three or foure thinges: I Loue my meate, choise of Suters: Cloathes in the Fashion: and like a right woman I loue to haue my will. Scar. What thinke you of me for a Husband? Clar. Let me first know, what you think of me for a wife? Scar. Troth I thinke you are a proper Gentlewoman. Clar. Do you but thinke so? Scar. Nay I see you are a very perfect proper Gentlewoman. Clar. It is great pitty then I should be alone without a proper man. Scar. Your father sayes I shall marry you. Clar. And I say God forbid Sir: I am a great deale to young. Scar. I loue thee by my troth. Clar. O pray you do not so, for then you stray from the steps of Gentility, the fashion among them is to marry first, and loue after by leisure. Scarb. That I do loue thee, here by heauen I sweare, and cal it as a witnes to this kisse. Clar. You will not inforce me I hope Sir? Scar. Makes me this womans husband, thou art my Clare, Accept my hart, and prooue as Chast, as fayre. Clare, O God, you are too hot in your gifts, shoulde I accept them, we should haue you plead nonage, some halfe a year hence: sue for reuersement, &amp; say the deed was done vnder age. Scar. Prethee do not Iest? Cl. No (God is my record) I speak in earnest: &amp; desire to know Whether ye meane to marry me, yea or no. Scar. This hand thus takes thee as my louing wife, Clar. For better, for worse. Scar. I, till death vs depart loue. Clar. Why then I thanke you Sir, and now I am like to haue that I long lookt for: A Husband. How soone from our owne tongues is the word sed, Captiues our maiden-freedome to a head. Scar. Clare your are now mine, and I must let you know, What euery wise doth to her husband owe, To be a wise, is to be Dedicate Not to a youthfull course, wild, and vnstedy, But to the soule of vertue, obedience, Studying to please, and neuer to offend. Wiues, haue two eyes created, not like Birds To rome about at pleasure, but for two sentinels, To watch their husbands safety as their owne, Two hands, ones to feed him, the other her selfe: Two feet, and one of them is their husbands, They haue two of euery thing, onely of one, Their Chastity, that should be his alone. Their very thoughts they cannot tearme them one, Maids being once made wiues, can nothing call Rightly their owne; they are their husbands all: If such a wife you can prepare to be, Clare I am yours: and you are fit for me. Clar. We being thus subdued, pray you know then, As women owe a duty, so do men. Men must be like the branch and barke to trees, Which doth defend them from tempestuous rage, Cloth them in Winter, tender them in age, Or as Ewes loue vnto their Eanlings liues, Such should be husbands custome to their wiues. If it appeare to them they haue straid amisse, They onely must rebuke them with a kisse, Or Clock them, as Hens Chickens, with kind call, Couer them vnder their wing, and pardon all: No iarres must make two beds, no strife denide them, Those betwixt whom a faith and troth is giuen, Death onely parts, since they are knit by heauen: If such a husband you intend to be, I am your Clare, and you are sit for me. Scar. By heauen. Clar. Aduise before you sweare, let me remember you, Men neuer giue their faith, and promise mariage, But heauen records their oth: If they proue true, Heauen smiles for ioy, if not it weepes for you, Vnlesse your hart, then with your wordes agree, Yet let vs part, and lesse vs both be free. Scar. If euer man in swearing loue, swore true, My words are like to his: Heere comes your father. Enter Sir Iohn Harcop, Ilford, Wentloe, Bartley, and Butler. Har. Now maister Scarborrow. Sca.

Clare I must leaue thee, with what vnwillingnes Witnes this dwelling kisse vpon thy lip, And tho I must be absent from thine eye, Be sure my hart doth in thy bosome lie, Three yeares I am yet a ward, which time Ile passe, Making thy faith my constant Looking-glasse, Till when.

Ilf. O, that was his Taylor, I see now he wil be blest he profits by my counsell, he will pay no debts before he be arested, nor then neither, if he can finde ere a beast that dare but be bayle for him, but he will seale i'th afternoone.

Then heauen grant he may, as few married men do, make much of his wife. Went. Why? wouldst haue him loue her, let her command al, and make her his master? Ilf. No no, they that do so, make not much of theyr wiues, but giue them their will, and its the marring of em. Enter Bartley. Bart. Honest Franke, valerous Francke, a portion of thy witte, but to helpe vs in this enterprise, and we may walk London stret and cry pish at the Sergiants. Ilf. You may shift out one tearme, and yet die in the Counter, these are the scabs now that hang vpon honest Iob, I am Iob, and these art the scuruy scabbes, but whats this your pet seeths ouer withall? Bart. Maister Scarborrow is a married man. Went. He has all his land in his owne hand. Bart. His brothers and sisters portions. Went. Besides foure thousand pound in ready money with his wife. Ilf. A good talent by my faith, it might helpe many Gentlemen to pay their Tailours, and I might be one of them. Went. Nay, honest Frank, hast thou found a tricke for him, if thou hast not, looke heeres a line to direct thee. First draw him into bands for money, then to dice for it: Then take vp stuffe at the Mercers, straight to a punke with it: Then morgage his Lande, and be drunke with that: so with them and the rest, from an Ancient Gentleman, make him a young begger. Ilf. What a Roge is this, to read a lecture to me, and mine owne lesson too, which he knowes I ha made perfect to 9 hundred fourscore and nineteene. A cheating Rascall wil teach me that ha made them that haue worne a spatious Parke, Lodge and all of theyr backes this morning: bin fayne to pawne it afore night, and they that ha stauked like a huge Elephant, with a Castle on theyr neckes, and remooued y e to their owne shoulders in one day which their fathers built vp in seuen yeare, bin glad by my meanes, in so much time as a childe suckes, to drinke bottle Ale, tho a punk pay fort. And shal this Parat instruct me? Went. Nay but Franke. Ilf. A roge that hath fed vpon me, &amp; the fruit of my wit like Pullen from a Pantlers chipings, and now I put him into good cloths to shift two sutes in a day, that could scare shift a patcht shirt onte in a yeare, and sayes prayers when he had it: hark, how he prates. Went. Besides Franke, since his marriage, he slawkes me like a cashierd Captaine discontent, in which Melancholy, the leaste drop of mirth, of which thou hast an Ocean, will make him, and all his ours for euer. Ilf. Sayes mine owne Roge so, giue mee thy hand then, weele doot, and theres earnest. Strikes him. Sfut you Chittiface, that lookes worse then a Collier thorough a woodden window, an Ape afeard of a whip, or a Knaues head, shooke seauen yeares in the weather vpon London-bridge. Do you Catechize me? Wen. Nay but valorous Franke, he that knowes the secrets of al harts, knowes I did it in kindnes. Ilf. Know your seasons: besides, I am not of that Species for you to instruct.

Who weds as I haue to inforced sheets, His care increaseth, but his comfort fleets. Ilf. Thou hauing so much witte, what a Deuill meantst thou to marry? Scar. O speake not of it, Marriage sounds in mine eare like a Bell, Not rung for pleasure, but a dolefull knell. Ilf. A common course, those men that are married in the Morning, to wish themselues buried ere night. Scar. I cannot loue her. Ilf. No newes neither, wiues know thats a generall fault amongst their Husbands. Scar. I will not ly with her. Ilf. Cetera volunt sheele say still, If you wil not, another wil. Scar. Why did she marry me, knowing I did not loue her. Ilf. As other women do, either to bee maintaind by you, or to make you a Cuckold. Now sir, what come you for? Enter Clowne. Clow. As men do in hast, to make an end of their busines. Ilf. Whats your busines? Clow. My busines is this Sir, this Sir, and this Sir, Ilf. The meaning of al this Sir. Cl. By this is as much as to say Sir, my Mai. has sent vnto you. By this is as much as to say Sir, my maister has him humbly commended vnto you, and by this is as much as to say, my master craues your answere. Ilf. Giue me your Letter. And you shal haue this Sir, this Sir, and this Sir. Clow. No Sir. Ilford. Why Sir? Clow. Because as the learned haue very well instructed me, Qui supranos, nihil adnos, and tho many Gentlemen will haue to doe with other mens busines, yet from me know, the most part of them proue knaues for their labor. Went. You ha the Knaue yfaith Franke. Clo. Long may hee liue to enioy it. From Sir Iohn Harcop of Harcop, in the County of Yorke Knight, by me his man, to your selfe my young maister, by these presents greeting. Ilf. How camst thou by these good words? Clow. As you by your good cloaths, tooke them vpon trust, &amp; swore I would neuer pay for em. Scar. Thy maister Sir Iohn Harcop writes to me, That I should entertaine thee for my man, His wish is acceptable, thou art welcome fellow. Oh but thy maisters Daughter, sends an Article Which makes me thinke vpon my present sinne, Here she remembers me to keepe in minde My promis'd faith to her, which I ha broke. Here she remembers me I am a man, Blacke ore with periury, whose sinfull breast, Is Charactred like those curst of the blest. Ilf. How now my young Bully, like a young wench forty weeks after the losse of her Mayden-head, crying out. Scar. Trouble me not, Giue me Pen, Inke, and Paper, I will write to her, O? but what shall I write? Mine owne excuse, why no excuse can serue For him that swears, and from his oth doth swarue? Or shall I say, my marriage was inforcst, Twas bad in them, not well in me to yeeld, Wretched thee to whose marriage was compeld, Ile onely write that which my graue hath bred, Forgiue me Clare, for I am married: Tis soone set downe, but not so soone forgot, or worne from h?ce. Deliuer it vnto her, theres for thy paines, Would I as soone could cleanse these periurd staines. Clow. Well, I could alter mine eies from filthy mud into fair water: you haue paid for my teares, and mine eyes shal proue bankerouts, and breake out for you, let no man perswade me, I will cry, and euery Towne betwixt Shoreditch-church and Yorke bridge, shall beare me witnesse. Exit. Scar. Gentlemen, Ile take my leaue of you, She that I am married to but not my wife, Will London leaue, in Yorkeshire lead our life. Ilf. We must not leaue you so my young Gallant, We three are sicke in state, and your wealth must helpe to make vs whole againe. For this saying, is as true as old: Strife nurst twixt man and wife, makes such a flaw, How great so eres their wealth, twil haue a thaw, Enter Sir Iohn Harcop with his Daughter Clare, and two younger Brothers, Thomas, and Iohn Scarborrow. Har. Brothers to him ere long shall be my sonne, By wedding this young girle: You are welcome both, Nay kisse her, kisse, tho that she shall Be your Brothers wife, to kisse the cheeke is free. Tho. Kisse, Sfut what else? thou art a good plumpe wench, I like you well, prethee make hast and bring store of boyes, but bee sure they haue good faces, that they may call me vnckle. Io. Glad of so faire a sister, I salute you. Har. Good, good yfaith, this kissings good yfaith, I lou'd to smacke it too when I was young, But Mum: they haue felt thy cheek Clare, let them hear thy tung. Clar. Such welcome as befits my Scarborrows brothers, From me his troth-plight wife be sure to haue, And tho my tongue proue scant in any part, The bounds be sure are large, full in my hare. Tho. Tut, thats not that we doubt on wench, but do you heare Sir Iohn what doe you thinke drue mee from London, and the Innes of Court, thus farre into Yorkshire? Har. I gesse to see this girle, shal be your sister. Tho. Faith, and I gesse partly so too, but the maine was, and I will not lie to you, that your comming nowe in this wise into our kindred, I might be acquainted with you aforehand, that after my brother had married your daughter, I his brother might borrowe some money of you. Har. What? Do you borrow of your kindred Sir? Thom. Sfut what else, they hauing interrest in my blood, why shoulde not I haue interrest in their coyne. Besides Sir, I being a younger brother, would be ashamed of my generation if I would not borrow of any man that would lend, especially of my affinitie, of whom I keepe a Kalender. And looke you Sir, thus I goe ouer them. Frst ore my Vnckles, often ore mine Aunts, then vp to my Nephewes, straight downe to my Neeces, to this Cosen Thomas, and that Cosen Ieffrey, leauing the courteous claw giuen to none of their elbowes, euen vnto the thirde and fourth remooue of any that hath interest in our blood. Al which do vpon their summons made by me, duely and faithfully prouide for appearance, and so as they are, I hope we shall be, more indeerd, inuerly, better, and more feelingly acquainted. Har. you are a merrie Gentleman. Tho. Tis the hope of monie makes me so, and I know none but fooles vse to be sad with it. Ioh. From Oxford am I drawne, from serious studies Expecting that my brother still had soiournd With you his best of choyse, and this good Knight. Har. His absence shall not make our harts lesse merrie Then if we had his presence. A daie ere long, Will bring him backe, when one the other meets, At noone ith Church, at night betweene the sheets. Weele wash this chat with wine. Some wine: fill vp, The sharpner of the wit, is a full cup. And so to you Sir. Tho. Do, and Ile drinke, to my new sister, but vpon this condition, that she may haue quiet daies, little rest a nights, ha pleasant afternoones, bee plyant to my brother, and lend me money when soere Ile borrow it. Har. Nay, nay, nay, Women are weake and we must beare with them, Your frolicke healths, are onely fit for men, Tho. Well, I am contented, women must to the wal, tho it be to a feather-bed. Fill vp then. Enter Clowne. Clo. From London am I come, tho not with pipe and Drum, Yet I bring matter, in this poore paper, Will make my young mistris, delighting in kisses, Do as all Maidens will, hearing of such an ill, As to haue lost, the thing they wisht most, A Husband, a Husband, a pretty sweet Husband, Cry oh, oh, oh, and alas, And at last ho, ho, ho, as I do. Clar. Returnd so soone from London? Whats the newes? Clow. O mistris, if euer you haue seene Demoniceacleare look into mine eyes, mine eyes are Seuerne, plaine Seuerne, the Thames, nor the Ryuer of Tweed are nothing to em: Nay all the rayne that fell at Noahs floud, had not the discretion that my eyes haue: that drunke but vp the whole world, and I ha drownd all the way betwixt this and London. Cla. Thy newes good Robbin. Clow. My newes mistres, Ile tell you strange newes, the dust vpon London way, being so great, that not a Lorde, Gentleman, Knight, or Knaue could trauell, least his eies should bee blowne out: At last, they all agreed to hyre me to go before them, when I looking but vpon this Letter, did with this water, this very water, lay the dust, as well as if it had raind from the beginning of Aprill to the last of May. Clar. A Letter from my Scarborrow, giue it thy mistris. Clow. But Mistris. Cla. Prethee be gon, I would not haue my father nor this Gentlemen, Be witnes of the comfort it doth bring. Clo. Oh but mistris. Cla. Prethee begone, With this, and the glad newes, leaue me alone. Exit Clo. Tho. Tis your turne Knight, take your licquor, know I am bountifull, Ile forgiue any man any thing that hee owes mee, but his drinke, and that Ile be paid for. Cla. Nay Gentlemen the honesty of myrth Consists not in Carowsing with excesse, My father hath more welcomes then in wine: Pray you no more. Tho. Sayes my sister so, Ile be ruld by thee then. Do you heare, in hope hereafter youle lend me some mony, now we are halfe drunk lets go to dinner. Come Knight. Exeunt. Manet Cla. Clar. I am glad your gone, Shall I now opent: no, Ile kisse it first, Because his outside last did kisse his hand. Within this fould, Ile calt a sacred sheet, Are writ blacke lines, when our white harts shall meet, Before I ope this dore of my delight, Methinkes I gesse how kindly he doth write, Of his true Loue to me, as Chuck, Sweet-hart, I prethee do not thinke the time too long, That keepes vs from the sweets of marriage rites, And then he sets my name and kisses it, Wishing my lips his sheet to write vpon, With like desire methinkes as mine owne thoughts, Aske him now heere for me to looke vpon, Yet at the last thinking his loue too slacke, Ere it arriue at my desired eyes, He hastens vp his message with like speed, Euen as I breake this ope, wishing to read: Oh: whats hear? Mine eyes are not mine owne? sure th'are not, Tho you ha bin my lamps this sixteene years, Lets fall the Let. You do belie my Scarborrow reading so; Forgiue him, he is married, that were Ill: What lying lights are these. Looke I ha no such Letter, No wedded sillable of the least wrong Done to a Troth-plight-Virgin like my selfe. Beshrow you for your blindnes: Forgiue him, he is married. I know my Scarborrowes constancie to me, Is as firme knit, as faith to Charity, That I shall kisse him often, hug him thus, Be made a happy and a fruitfull Mother Of many prosperous children like to him, And read I, he was maried? Askt forgiuenes? What a blind Foole was I? yet heeres a Letter To whom directed tro? To my beloued Clare. Why Law? Women will read, and read not that they saw, Twas but my feruent loue misled mine eyes, Ile once againe to the Inside, Forgiue me, I am married: william Scarborrow. He has set his name too't to, O periury? within the harts of men Thy feasts are kept, their tongues proclaimeth them. Enter Thomas Scarborrow. Tho. Sister, Gods precious, the cloths laide, the meate cooles, we all stay, and your father cals for you. Clar. Kind Sir, excuse me I pray you a little, Ile but peruse this Letter and come straight. Tho. Pray you make hast, the meat staies for vs, and our stomacks Ready for the meat, for beleeue this, Drinke makes men hungry, or it makes them lie, And he thats drunke ore night, ith mornings dry, Seene and approued. Exit. Clar. He was contracted mine, yet he vniust Hath married to another: whats my estate then? A wretched maid, not fit for any man, For being vnited his with plighted faiths, Who euer sues to me commits a sinne, Besiedgeth me, and who shal marry me: Is like my selfe, liues in Adultery, (O God) That such hard Fortune, should betide my youth. I am Young, Fayre, Rich, Honest, Virtuous, yet for all this, who ere shall marry mee I am but his whore, liue in Adultery. I cannot step into the path of pleasure For which I was created, borne vnto, Let me liue nere so honest, rich or poore, If I once wed, yet I must liue a whore. I must be made a strumpet gainst my will, A name I haue abhord, a shamefull Ill I haue eschewed, and now cannot withstand it In my selfe. I am my fathers onely child, In me he hath a hope, tho not his name Can be increast, yet by my Issue His land shall be possest, his age delighted. And tho that I should vow a single life To keepe my soule vnspotted, yet will he Inforce me to a marriage: So that my griefe doth of that waight consist, It helpes me not to yeeld, nor to resist: And was I then created for a Whore? A whore, Bad name, bad act, Bad man makes me a scorn: Then liue a Strumpet? Better be vnborne. Enter Iohn Scarborow Sister, Pray you will you come, Your father and the whole meeting stayes for you. Clar. I come, I come, I pray returne: I come. Iohn. I must not goe without you. Clare, Be thou my Vsher, sooth Ile follow you Exit. He writes here to forgiue him, he is marryed: False Gentleman: I do forgiue thee with my hart, Yet will I send an answere to thy letter, And in so short words thou shalt weep to read them, And hears my agent ready: Forgiue me, I am dead. Tis writ, and I will act it: Be iudge you Mayds Haue trusted the false promises of men. Be iudge you wiues, the which haue been inforst From the white sheets you lou'd, to them ye loathed: Whether this Axiome may not be assured, Better one sinne, then many be endured. My armes imbracings, Kisses, Chastity, Were his possessions: and whilst I liue He doth but steale those pleasures he enioyes, Is an Adulterer in his married armes, And neuer goes to his defiled bed, But God writes sin vpon the Teasters hed. Ile be a Wife now, helpe to saue his soule Tho I haue lost his body, giue a slake To his iniquities, and with one sinne Done by this hand, ende many done by him. Farwell the world, then farewell the wedded ioyes Till this I haue hop't for, from that Gentleman, Scarborrow, forgiue me: thus thou hast lost thy wife, Yer record would, though by an act too foule, A wife thus did to cleanse her husbands soule. Enter Sir Iohn Harcop. Har. Gods precious, for his mercy, wheres this wench? Must all my friends and guests attend on you? Where are you Minion? Clar. Scarborrow come close mine eyes, for I am dead. Har. That sad voyce was not hers I hope: Whose this, my daughter? Clar. Your daughter, That begs of you to see her buried, Prayes Scarborrow to forgiue her: she is dead. Dyes. Har. Patience good teares, and let my words haue way Clare, my daughter, helpe my seruants there: Lift vp thine eyes, and looke vpon thy father, They were not borne to loose their light so soone, I did beget thee for my comforter, And not to be the Author of my care. Why speakst thou not? Some helpe my Seruants there: What hand hath made thee pale? Or if thine owne, What cause hadst thou that wert thy fathers Ioy, The Treasure of his age, the Cradle of his sleepe, His all in all? I prethee speake to me? Thou art not ripe for death, come backe againe, Clare, my Clare, If death must needs haue one, I am the fittest, prethee let me go, Thou dying whilst I liue, I am dead with woe. Enter Thomas, and Iohn Scarborrow. Tho. What meanes this outcry? Io. O ruthfull spectacle. Har. Thou wert not wont to be so sullen childe, But kind and louing to thy aged father: Awake, awake, Ift be thy lasting sleepe, Would I had not sence for griefe, nor eies to weepe. Io. What Papers this, the sad contents doth tell me, My Brother writ, he hath broke his faith to her, And she replies, for him she hath kild her selfe. Har. Was that the cause that thou hast soyld thy selfe, With these red spots, these blemishers of beauty? My child, my childe, wast periury in him, Made thee so fayre, act now so foule a finne, That he deceiued thee in a Mothers hopes, Posterity, the blisse of marriage? Thou hast no tung to answere no, or I, But in red Letters writes: For him I die. Curse on his Traiterous tung, his youth, his blood, His pleasures, Children, and possessions, Be all his dayes like winter, comfortlesse: Restles his nights, his wants Remorcelesse, And may his Corps be the Phisitians stage, Which plaid vpon, stands not to honored Age, Or with diseases may he lie and pine, Till greefe wasts blood, his eies, as greefe doth mine. Exit Ioh. O good old man, made wretched by this deed, The more thy age, were to be pittied. Enter Scarborrow, his wife Katherine, Ilford, Wentlo, Barley and Butler. Ilf. What ride by the gate, &amp; not call, that were a shame yfaith. Went. Weele but taste of his Beere, kisse his Daughter, and to horse againe, wheres the good Knight heare? Scar. You bring me to my shame vnwillingly. Ilf. Shamed of what, for deceiuing of a wench, I ha not blusht, that had nut to a hundred of em. In womens loue hees wise, doth follow this. Loue one so long till her another kisse. Wheres the good Knight heere? Io. O Brother, you are come to make your eie Sad mourner at a fatall Tragedy. Peruse this Letter first, and then this Corps. Scar. O wronged Clare? Accursed Scarborrow? I writ to her, that I was married, She writes to me, forgiue her she is dead: Ile balme thy body with my faithfull teares, And be perpetuall mourner at thy Tombe, Ile sacrifice this Commit into sighes, Make a consumption of this pile of man, And all the benefits my parents gaue, Shall turne distempered to appease the wrath For this blood shed, and I am guilty of. Kat. Deere husband. Scar. False woman, not my wife, tho married to me, Looke what thy friends, and thou art guilty of, The murther of a creature, equald heauen In her Creation, whose thoughts like fire, Neuer lookt base, but euer did aspire To blessed benifits, till you and yours vndid her, Eye her, view, tho dead, yet she dus looke, Like a fresh frame, or a new printed booke Of the best paper, neuer lookt into, But with one sullied finger, which did spot her, Which was her owne too, but who was cause of it, Thou and thy friends, and I will loath thee fort. Enter Sir Iohn Harcop. Har. They do bely her that do say shees dead, She is but straid to some by-gallery, And I must ha her againe. Clare, where art thou Clare? Scar. Here, laid to take her euerlasting sleepe. Har. A lyes that sayes so, Yet now I know thee, I do lie that say it, For if she be a villen like thy selfe, A periurd Traitor, recreant; miscreant, Dog, a dog, a dog, has dunt. Scar. O Sir Iohn Harcop. Hra. O Sir Iohn villen, to be troth thy selfe To this good creature, harmelesse, harmeles child, This kernell hope, and comfort of my house, Without Inforcement, of thine own accord, Draw all her soule ith compasse of an oth, Take that oth from her, make her for none but thee, And then betray her? Scar. Shame on them were the cause of it. Har. But harke what thou hast got by it, Thy wife is but a strumpet, thy children Bastards, Thy selfe a murderer, thy wife, accessary, Thy bed a stewes, thy house a Brothell. Scar. O, tis too true. Har. I, made a wretched father childles. Scar. I, made a married man, yet wiueles. Har. Thou the cause of it. Scar. Thou the cause of it. Har. Curse on the day that ere it was begun, For I an old man am, vndone, vndone. Exit Scar. For Charity haue care vpon your father, Least that his greefe, bring on a more mishap, This to my armes, my sorrow shall bequeath, Tho I haue lost her, to thy graue Ile bring, Thou wert my wife, and Ile thy Requiem sing: Go you to the Country, Ile to London backe, All ryot now, since that my soules so blacke. Exit with Clare. Ka. Thus am I left like Sea-tost-Marriners, My Fortunes being no more then my distresse, Vpon what shore soeuer I am driuen, Be it good or bad, I must account it heauen, Tho married, I am reputed not a wife, Neglected of my Husband, scornd, despis'd, And tho my loue and true obedience Lies prostrate to his becke, his heedles eye, Receiues my seruices vnworthily. I know no cause, nor will be cause of none, But hope for better dayes when bad be gone, You are my guide, whether must I, Butler? But. Toward Wakefield, where my masters liuing lyes. Ka. Toward Wakefield where thy maister weele attend, When things are at the worst, tis hopt theyle mend. Enter Thomas, and Iohn Scarborrow. Tho. How now sister, no further forward on your iourney yet? Ka. When greefes before one, who'd go on to griefe, Ide rather turne me backe to find some comfort. Iohn. And that way sorrowes hurtfuller then this, My Brother hauing brought vnto a graue, That murthered body whom he cald his wife, And spent so many teares vpon her Hearse, As would haue made a Tyrant to relent, Then kneeling at her Coffin, thus he vowd, From thence he neuer would embrace your bed. Tho. The more Foole he. Iohn. Neuer from hence acknowledge you his wife, When others striue to enrich their fathers name, It should be his only ayme, to begger his, To spend their meanes, and in his onely pride, Which with a sigh confirmd, hees rid to London, Vowing a course, that by his life so foule Men nere should ioyn the hands, without the soule. Kath. All is but griefe, and I am armd for it. Iohn. Weel bring you on your way in hope thats strong Time may at length make strait. what yet is wrong. Exit. Enter Ilford, Wentlos, Bartley. Went.

As sure as I am now, &amp; was dead drunke last night. Ilf. Why then so sure will I be arrested by a couple of Sergeants, and fall into one of the vnlucky Crankes about Cheapside, cald Counters. Bar. Withall, I haue prouided M. Grype the Vsurer, whoe vpon the instant will be ready to step in, charge the Seargeaunts to keepe thee fast, and that now hee will haue his fiue hundered pounds, or thou shalt rot for it. Went. When it followes, young Scarborow shall be bounde for the one: then take vp as much more, we share the one half, &amp; help him to be drunke with the other. Ilf. Ha, ha, ha. Enter Scarborow. Bar. Why, dost laugh Franke? Ilf. To see that wee and Vsurers liue by the fal of yong heirs as swine by the dropping of Acorns. But hees come. Where be these Rogues? shall we ha no tendance here? Scarb. Good day Gentlemen. Ilf. A thousand good dayes, my noble Bully, and as manye good fortunes as there wer Grashoppers in Egypt, and thats couered ouer with good lucke: but Nouns, Pronounes, and Participles.

Scar. O, do not hurt the fellow? Exit Drawer Ilf. Hurt him, hang him, Scrape-trencher, star-waren, Wine spiller, mettle-clancer, Rogue by generation. Why, dost heare Will? If thou dost not vse these Grape-spillers as you doe theyr pottle-pots, quoit em down stayres three or foure times at a supper, theyle grow as sawcy with you as Sergeants, and make bils more vnconscionable then Taylors. Enter Drawer Draw. Heres the pure and neat grape Gent. I hate for you. Ilford. Fill vp: what ha you brought here, goodman roge? Drawer. The pure element of Claret sir. Ilf. Ha you so, and did not I call for Rhenish Throws the wine in the Drawers face. you Mungrell? Scar. Thou needst no wine, I prethee be more mild? Ilf. Be mild in a Tauerne, tis treason to the red Lettyce, enemy to their signe post, and slaue to humor: Prethee, lets be mad, Then fill our heads with wine, till euery pate be drunke, Then pisse i'the street, Iustell all you meet, and with a Punke, As thou wilt do now and then: Thanke me thy good Mayster, that brought thee to it. Went. Nay, he profits well, but the worst is he will not swear yet Scar. Do not belie me: If there be any good in me thats the best: Oathes are necessary for nothing, They passe out of a m?s mouth, like smoake through a chimney, that files all the waye it goes. Went. Why then I think Tobacco be a kind of swearing, for it furs our nose pockily. Scar. But come, lets drinke our selues into a stomach asor supper. Ilf. Agreed. Ile begin with a new health. Fill vp. To them that mnke Land fly, By wine, whores, and a Die. To them, that only thriues, By kissing others Wiues. To them that pay for cloathes, With nothing but with Oathes: Care not from whom they get, So they may be in debt: This health my harts drinkes. But who their Taylors pay, Borrow, and keepe their day, Weel hold him like this Glasse, A brainlesse empty Asse, And not a mate for vs. Drinke round my harts. Wen. An excellent health. Enter Drawer. Mayster Ilford, theres a couple of strangers beneath desires to speake with you. Ilf. What beards ha they? Gentleman-like-beards, or broker-like-beards? Drawer. I am not so well acquainted with the Art of Face-mending sir: but they would speake with you. Ilf. Ile goe downe to em. Went. Doe: and weele stay here and drinke Tobacco. Scarb. Thus like a Feuer that doth shake a man From strength to weaknesse, I consume my selfe: I know this company, theyr custome vilde, Hated, abhord of good-men, yet like a childe By reasons rule instructed how to know Euill from good, I to the worser go. Why doe you suffer this, you vpper powers, That I should surfet in the sinne I tast, haue sence to feele my mischiefe, yet make wast Of heauen and earth: My selfe will answer, what my selfe doth aske? Who once doth cherish sinne, begets his shame, For vice being fosterd once, coms Impudence, Which makes men count sinne, Custom, not offence, When all like mee, their reputation blot, Pursuing euill, while the good's forgot. Enter Ilford led in by a couple of Sergeants, and Gripe the Vsurer. Ser. Nay, neuer striue, we can hold you. Ilf. I, me, and any man else, and a fall into your Clutches: Let go your tugging, as I am a Gentleman, Ile be your true prisoner. Wen. How now: whats the matter Franke? Ilf. I am fallen into the hands of Sergiants, I am arested. Bart. How, arrest a Gentleman in our company? Ilf. Put vp, put vp, for sins sake put vp, lets not all suppe in the Counter to night let me speak with maister Gripe the Creditor. Grip. Well: what say you to me Sir? Ilf. You haue arrested me heere maister Gripe. Gri. Not I Sir, the Sergiants haue. Ilf. But at your sute master Gripe: yet hear me, as I am a Gent. Gri. I rather you could say as you were an honest man, and then I might beleeue you. Ilf. Yet heare me. Gri. Heare me no hearings, I lent you my mony for good will. Ilf. And I spent it for meere necessity, I confesse I owe you fiue hundred pound, and I confesse I owe not a peny to any man, but he wold be glad to hate: my bond you haue already master Gripe If you will, now take my word. Grip. Word me no wordes: Officers looke to your prisoner: If you cannot either make me present paiment, or put me in security such as I shall like too. Ilf. Such as you shall like too: what say you to this young Gent. He is the widgen that wee must feed vpon. Grip. Who young maister Scarborrow, he is an honest Gentleman for ought I know, I nere lost peny by him. Ilf. I would be ashamd any man should say so by me, that I haue had dealings withall: But my inforced friends, wilt please you but to retire into some smal distance, whilst I discend with a few words to these Gentlemen, and Ile commit my selfe into your hands immediately. Ser. Well sir weele wait vpon you. Ilf. Gentlemen I am to proferre some conference, and in especially to you maister Scarborrow, our meeting here for your mirth hath proued to me thus aduerse, that in your companies I am Arrested: How ill it will stand with the flourish of your reputations when men of ranke and note communicate, that I Franke Ilforde, Gentlem. whose Fortunes may transcend, to make ample Gratuities future, and heape satisfaction for any present extention of his friends kindnes, was Inforced from the Miter in Bredstreet, to the Counter i'th Poultrey: for mine owne part, if you shall thinke it meet, and that it shall acord with the state of gentry, to submit my selfe from the featherbed in the Maisters side, or the Flock-bed in the Knights warde, to the straw-bed in the hole, I shall buckle to my heeles insted of guilt spurs, the armour of patience, and doote. Went. Come, come, what a pox need all this, this is Mellis Flora, the sweetest of the hony, he that was not made to fat Cattel, but to feed Gentlemen. Bart. You weare good cloaths. Wen. Are well descended. Bart. Keepe the best company. Went. Should regard your credit. Bar. Stand not vpon't, be bound, be bound. Wen. Ye are richly married. Bar. Loue not your wife, Wen.

Your bond with land conuaid, which may assure me of mine owne againe. Scar. You shal be satisfied, and Ile become your debter, for full fiue hundred more then he doth owe you. This night we sup heere, beare vs company, And bring your Counsell, Scriuener, and the mony with you, Where I wil make as ful assurance as in the Law you'd wish. Gri. I take your word Sir, And so discharge you of your prisoner. Ilf. Why then lets come and take vp a new roome, the infected hath spit in this. He that hath store of Coyne, wants not a frend, Thou shalt receiue sweet rogue, and we will spend. Exeunt. Enter Thomas and Iohn Scarborrow, Ioh. Brother, you see the extreamity of want Inforceth vs to question for our owne, The rather that we see, not like a Brother Our Brother keepes from vs to spend on other. Tho. True, he has in his hands our portions, the patrimony which our Father gaue vs, with which he lies fatting himselfe with Sacke and suger in the house, and we are faine to walke with lean purses abroad. Credit must be maintained which wil not be without mony, Good cloaths must be had, which will not be without money, company must be kept which wil not be without money, al which we must haue, and from him we will haue money. Io. Besides, we haue brought our sister to this Towne, That she her selfe hauing her owne from him, Might bring her selfe in Court to be preferd, Vnder some Noble personage, or els that he Whose friends are great in Court, by his late match, As he is in nature bound, prouide for her. Tho. And he shall do it brother, tho we haue waited at his lodging, longer then a Taylours bil on a young Knight for an old rekoning, without speaking with him, Heere we know he is, and we wil call him to parle. Io. Yet let vs doot in mild and gentle tearmes, Faire words perhaps may sooner draw our owne, Then ruffer courses by which his mischiefe grown. En. Draw Dr. Anon, anon, looke downe into the Dolphine there. Tho. Here comes a drawer we wil question him. Tho. Doe you heare my friend, is not maister Scarborrow here? Draw. Here sir, what a iest is that, where should hee bee else, I would haue you well know my maister hopes to grow rich before he leaues him. Io. How long hath he continued heere since he came hether. Draw. Faith Sir not so long as Noahs floude, yet long enough to haue drowned vp the liuings of three Knights, as Knights goes now adaies, some moneth or there abouts. Iohn. Time ill consumed to ruinate our house, But what are they that keepe him company? Draw. Pitch, Pitch; but I must not say so, but for your further satisfaction, did you euer see a young whelpe and a Lyon plaie together. Iohn. Yes. Draw. Such is maister Scarborrows company. Within Oliuer. Draw. Anon, anon, looke downe to the Pomgranate there. Tho. I prethee say heeres them would speake with him. Draw. Ile do your message: Anon, anon there. Exit Iohn. This foole speakes wiser then he is aware, young heires left in this towne where sins so ranke, And prodigals gape to grow fat by them, Are like young whelps throwne in the Lyons den, Who play with them awhile, at length deuoure them. Enter Scarborrow. Scar. Whose there would speake with me? Iohn. Your Brothers, who are glad to see you well. Scar, Well. Iohn. Tis not your ryot, that we heare you vse, (With such as waft their goods, as Time the world With a continuall spending, nor that you keepe The companie of a most Leprous route, Consumes your bodies wealth, infects your name With such Plague-sores, that had you reasons eie, Twould make you sicke, to see you visit them) Hath drawne vs, but our wants to craue the dew Our father gaue, and yet remaines with you. Tho. Our Byrth-right good brother, this Towne craues mainteinance, silke stockings must be had, and we would be loath our heritage should be arraigned at the Vintners bar, and so condemned to the Vintners box, though while you did keepe house, wee had some Belly-timber at your Table, or so, yet wee would haue you think, we are your Brothers, yet no Esaus to sell our patrimony for Porridge. Scar. So, so, what hath your comming else? Io. With vs our sister ioynes in our request, Whom we haue brought along with vs to London, To haue her portion, wherewith to prouide, An honord seruice, or an honest bride. Scar. So, then you two my Brothers, and she my sister, come not as in duty you are bound, to an elder brother, out of Yorkshire to see vs, but like leaches to sucke from vs. Io. We come compeld by want to craue our owne. Scar. Sir, for your owne, then thus be satisfied, Both hers and yours were left in trust with me, And I will keepe it for ye: Must you appoint vs, Or what we please to like mixt with reproofe, You haue bin to sawcy both, and you shall know, Ile curbe you for it, aske why; Ile haue it so? Io. We do but craue our owne. Scar. Your owne sir: whats your owne? Tho. Our portions giuen vs by our fathers will. Io. Which here you spend. Tho. Consume? Io. Wayes worse then ill. Scar. Ha, ha, ha. Enter Ilford. Ilf. Nay, nay, nay, Wil: prethy come away, we haue a full gallon of Sacke staies in the fire for thee, thou must pledge it to the health of a friend of thine. Scar. What dost thinke these are Franke? Ilf. They are Fidlers I thinke, if they be, I prethee sende them into the next roome, and let them scrape there, and weell send to them presently. Scar. They are my brothers Franke, come out of Yorkshire, To the Tauerne here, to aske their portions: they call my pleasures, ryots, my company Leproes, &amp; like a school boy, they would tutor me? Ilf. O, thou shouldst haue done wel to haue bound them prentises when they were young, they woulde haue made a couple of sawcy Taylers. Tho. Taylers? Ilf. I Birdlime: Taylers: Taylours are good men, and in the Terme time they weare good Cloathes. Come, you must learne more manners, stand at your Brothers backe, as to shift a Treancher neately, and take a Cuppe of Sacke, and a Capons legge contentedly. Tho. You are a slaue That feeds vpon my brother like a flie, Poysoning where thou dost sucke. Scar. You lie. Io. O, to my griefe I speake it, you shall find, Theres no more difference in a Tauern-haunter Then is betweene a Spittle and a Begger. Tho. Thou workst on him like Tempests on a ship. Io. And he the worthy Trafficke that doth sinke. Tho. Thou makst his name more loathsome then a graue. Io. Liuest like a Dog, by vomit, Tho. Die a slave? Heere they draw. Wentlo, and Bartley come in, and the two Vintners boyes, with Clubbes. All set vpon the two Brothers. Butler, Scarborrows man comes in, stands by, sees them fight takes part with neyther. But. Do, fight: I loue you all well, because you were my olde masters sonnes, but Ile neither part you, nor be partaker with you. I come to bring my mast, newes, he hath two sons borne at a birth in Yorkshire, and I find him together by the ears with his brothers in a Tauerne in London. Brother and brother at ods, tis naught: sure, it was not thus in the days of charity. Whats this world lyke to? Faith iust like an Inne-keepers Chamber-pot, receiues all waters, good and bad, It had need of much scouring. My old mast. kept a good house, and twenty or thirty tall sworde and Buckler men about him, and yfayth his sonne differs not much, he wil haue mettle to, tho he hath not store of Cutlers blades, he will haue plentie of Vintners pots. His father kept a good house for honest men, his Tenants, that brought him in part, and his son keeps a badde house with Knaues that helpe to consume al. Tis but the change of time: why shoulde any man repyne at it: Crekits, good liuing, and lucky wormes, were wont to feede, sing, and reioyce in the fathers chimney, and nowe Carrion Crowes builds in the sons Kitchen, I could be sorry for it, but I am too old to weepe. Well then, I will go tel him newes of his of-springs. Exit Enter the two brothers, Thomas and Iohn Scarborrow hurt, and sister. Sist. A as good Brothers, how came this mischance? Tho. Our portions, our brother hath giuen vs our portions sister, hath he not? Sist. He would not be so monstrous I am sure. Io. Excuse him not, he is more degenerate. Then greedy Vipers that deuoure their mother, They eat on her but to preserue themselues, And he consumes himselfe, and Beggers vs. A Tauerne is his Inne, where amongst Slaues, He kils his substance, making pots the graues To bury that which our forefathers gaue. I askt him for our portions, told him that you Were brought to London, and we were in want, Humbly we crau'd our owne, when his Reply Was, he knew none we had, beg, starue, or die. Sist. Alas what course is left for vs to liue by then? Tho. In troth sister, we two to beg in the fields, And you to betake your selfe to the old trade, Filling of smal Cans in the suburbes. Sist. Shall I be left then like a common road, That euery beast that can but pay his tole May trauel ouer, and like to Cammomil, Flourish the better being trodden on. Enter Butler bleeding. But, Well I will not curse him: he feedes now vppon Sacke &amp; Anchoues with a pox to him: but if he be not faine before he dies to eate Acornes, let me liue with nothing but pollerd, and my mouth be made a Cooking stoole for euery scolde to set her tayle on. Tho. How now Butler, whats the meaning of this? But. Your brother meanes to lame as many as he can, that is a begger himselfe, many liue with him in the Hospital. His wife sent me out of Yorkshire, to tell him, that God had blest him with two sonnes, he bids a plague of them, a vengeance of her, crosses mee ore the pate, and sendes mee to the Surgeons to seeke salue: I lookt at least he should haue giuen me a brace of Angels for my paines. Tho. Thou hast not lost all thy longing, I am sure he hath giuen thee a crackt crowne. But. A plague on his fingers, I cannot tel, he is your Brother &amp; my maister, I would be loath to Prophesie of him, but who soere doth cursse his Children being Infants, ban his wife lying in childbed, and beats his man brings him newes of it, they may bee borne rich, but they shall liue Slaues, be Knaues, and die Beggers. Sist. Did he do so. But. Gesse you, he bid a plague of them, a vengeance on her, &amp; sent me to the Surgeons. Sist. Why then I see there is no hope of him. Some husbandes are respectles of their wiues, During the time that they are yssulesse, But none with Infants blest, can nourish hate, But loue the mother for the childrens sake. Io. But hee that is giuen ouer vnto sin, Leprosed therewith without, and so within, O Butler, we were yssue to one father? But. And he was an honest Gentleman. Io. Whose hopes were better then the sunne he left, Should set so soon, vnto his houses shame. He liues in Tauernes, spending of his wealth, And heere his Brothers and distressed Sister, Not hauing any meanes to helpe vs with. Tho. Not a Scots Baubee (by this hand) to blesse vs with. Io. And not content to ryot out his owne, But he detaines our portions: suffers vs In this strange Ayre, open to euery wracke, Whilst he in ryot swims to be in lacke. But. The mores the pitty. Sist. I know not what course to take me to, Honesty faine would liue: What shall I do? But. Sooth Ile tell you, your brother hath hurt vs, We three will hurt you, and then go all to a spittle together. Sist. Iest not at her, whose burden is too greeuous, But rather lend a meanes how to releeue vs. But. Well I doe pitty you, and the rather because you saie, you woulde faine liue honest and want meanes for it, for I can tell you tis as strange heere to see a maid faire, poore, and honest, as to see a Collier with a cleane face. Maids heere do liue (especially without maintenance) Like Mice going to a trap, They nibble long, at last they get a clap. Your father was my good Benifactor, and gaue me a house whilst I liue to put my head in: for I would be loth then to see his onely daughter, for want of meanes, turne punk, I haue a drift to keepe you honest. Haue you a care to keepe your selfe so, yet you shall not know of it, for womens tounges are like siues, they will holde nothing, they haue power to vent. You two wil further me Iohn. In any thing good honest Butler. Tho. Ift be to take a purse Ile be one. But. Perhaps thou speakest righter then thou art aware of: wel, as chance is, I haue receiued my wages: there is forty shillings for you, Ile set you in a lodging, and till you heare from vs, let that prouide for you, weele first to the surgeons. To keepe you honest, and to keepe you braue, For once an honest man, will turne a Knaue. Exeunt. Enter Scarborrow hauing a Boy carrying a Torch with him, Ilford Wentlo, and Barley. Scar. Boy, bear the Torch faire: Now am I armd to fight with a Wind-mill, and to take the wall of an Emperor: Much drinke, no money: A heany head, and a light paire of heeles. Went. O, stand man? Scar. I weare an excellent creature to make a Punk of, I should downe with the least touch of a knaues finger, thou hast made a good night of this: What hast won Franke? Ilf. A matter of nothing, some hundred pounds. Scar. This is the hel of al gamsters, I thinke when they are at play, the boord eares vp the mo ey: For if there be fiue hundred pound lost, theres neuer but a hundred pounds wonne. Boy, take the wall of any man, and yet by light, such deedes of darknes may not be. Put out the Torch. Went. What dost meane by that Will? Scar. To saue charge, and walke like a Fury with a fire-brande in my hand, euery one goes by the light, &amp; weel go by the smoke. Enter Lord Faulconbridge. Scar. Boy, keepe the Wall: I will not budge for any man, by these Thumbs, and the paring of the Nayles shal stick in thy teeth not for a world. Lord. Whose this, young Scarborrow? Scar. The man that the Mare rid on. Lord. Is this the reuerence that you owe to me? Scar. You should haue brought me vp better. Lord. That vice should thus transforme man to a beast. Scar. Go to, your names Lorde, Ile talke with you when your out a debt and ha better cloaths. Lord. I pitty thee euen with my very soule. Scar. Pitty ith thy throat, I can drinke Muscadine and Egges, and Muld sack, do you heare: you put a peece of turnd stuffe vpon me, but I wil. Lord. What will you do Sir? Scar. Pisse in thy way, and thats no slander. Lord. Your sober blood wil teach you otherwise. Enter Sir William Scarborrow. S. Will. My honoured Lord, your happily wel met, Lord.

Bart. What shall she be, prethee? Ilf. No Lady, no widdow, nor no waiting gentlewoman, for vnder protection Ladyes may larde their husbands heads, Widdows will Woodcocks make, &amp; chambermayds of seru?gm? learn that, theyle ner forsake. Went. Who wilt thou wed then, prethe? Ilf. To any mayd, so she be fayr: To any mayd, so she be rich To any mayd so she be young: and to any mayde Bart. So she be honest. Ilf. Faith, its no great matter for her honestlye, for in these dayes, thats a Dowrie out of request. But. From these Crabes will I gather sweetnesse: wherin Ile imitate the Bee, that sucks her hony, not from the sweetest flowers, but Timb the bitterest: So these hauing beene the meanes to begger my mayster, shalbe the helpes to releeue his brothers and sister. Ilf. To whom shall I now be a suter? But. Faire fall ye Gallants. Ilf. Nay, and she be fayre she shall fall sure enough. Butler, how Ist good Butler. But. Wil you be made gallants? went.

Butler. Ilf. Dost not know me Butler? But. For Kex, dryde Kex, that in summer ha bin so liberal to fodder other mens cattle, and scarce haue inough to keepe your owne in Winter. Mine are precious Cabinets, and must haue pretious Iewels put into them, and I know you to he merchants of Stockfish, and not men for my market: Then vanish. Ilf. Come, ye old mad-cap you, what need all this? Cannot a man ha bin a little whoore-mayster in his youth, but you must vpbraide him with it, and tell him of his defects, which when he is maried, his wife shall finde in him? Why my fathers dead man now, who by his death has lest me the better part of a thousand a yeare. But. Tut, she of Lancashire has fifteen hundred. Ilf. Let me haue her then, good Butler. But. And then shee the bright beauty of Leystershire, has a thousand, nay thirteen hundred a yeare, at least. Ilf. Or let me haue her, honest Butler. But.

But they are the moste rare featurd, well faced, excellent spoke, rare qualited, vertuous, and worthy to be admired gentlewoman, All. And rich Butler? But. (I that must be one, tho they want all the rest) And rich Gallants, as are from the vtmost parts of Asya, to these present confines of Europe. All. And wilt thou helpe vs to them Butler? But. Faith, tis to be doubted, for pretious pearle will hardly be bought without pretious stones, and I think theres scarse one indifferent one to be found, betwixt you three: yet since there is some hope ye may proue honest, as by the death of your fathers Fathers you are proued rich, walke seuerally, for I knowing you all three to be couetous Tug-muttons will not trust you with the sight of each others beawty but will seuerally, talke with you, and since you haue deignd in this needfull portion of wedlocke to bee ruld by mee Butler, will most bountifully, prouide wiues for you generally.

You heard me tel them, I had Intelligence to giue of three Gentlewomen. Ilf. True. But. Now indeed Sir I ha but the performance of one. Ilf. Good. But. And her I doe intende for you, onely for you. Ilf. Honest Butler. But. Now sir, shee being but lately come to this towne, and so neerely watcht by the iealous eyes of her friends, she being a Rich heyre, least she should be stolne away by some disolute Prodigal, or desperat estated spend thrift, as you ha bin Sir. Ilf. O but thats past Butler. But. True I knowt, &amp; intend now but to make vse of them, flatter with them with hopefull promises, and make them needefull instruments. Ilf. To helpe me to the wench, But. You ha hit it which thus must be effected, first by keeping close your purpose. Ilf. Good. Ba. Also concealing from them, the lodging beauty and riches of your new, but admirable Mistris. Ilf. Excellent. But. Of which your following happines, if they should know either in enuy of your good, or hope of their owne aduancement theyd make our labours knowne to the gentlewomans Vncles, and so our benefit be frustrate. Ilf. Admirable Butler. But. Which done, als but this, being as you shal be brought into hir company, and by my praising your vertues you get possession of her Loue one morning step to the tower, or to make al sure, hier some stipendary prieste for money: for Money in these dayes, what wil not be done, and what will not a man do for a rich wife, and with him make no more ado but marrie hir in hir lodging and being married, lie with her and spare not. Ilf. Do they not see vs, do they not see vs, let mee kisse thee, let me kisse thee Butler, let but this be done, and all the benefit requitall and happines I can promise thee fort, shall be this, Ile be thy rich maister, and thou shalt carry my purse. But. Enough, meet me at her lodging some half an houre hence: harke she lies. Ilf. I hate. But. Faile not. Ilf. Will I liue. But. I wil but shift of these two Rhinoceros, Ilf. Wigens, wingens, a couple of guls. But. With some discourse of hope to wiue them two, and be with you straight. Ilf. Blest day, my loue shal be thy cushion honest Butler. But. So now to my tother Gallants. Went. O Butler, we ha bin in passion at thy tediousnes, But. Why looke you. I had al this talke for your good. Bar. Hadst. But. For you know the knight is but a scuruy-proud-prating-Prodigall, licentious vnnecessary. Went. An Asse, an Asse, an Asse. But. Now you heard me tel him I had three Wenches in store, Bar. And he would ha had them al would he. But. Heare me, tho he may liue to be an Oxe, he had not now so much of the Goat in him, but onely hopes for one of the three when indeed I ha but two, and knowing you to bee men of more vertue, and deerer in my respect intend them to be yours. Went. We shal honor thee. Bar. But how Butler. Bu. I am now going to their place of residence, scituate in the choisest place in the Citty, and at the signe of the Wolfe iust against Gold-smiths-row where you shal meet me, but ask not for me, only walk too and fro and to auoid suspition you may spende some conference with the Shop-keepers wiues, they haue seats built a purpose for such familiar entertainment, where from a bay window which is opposite, I wil make you knowne to your desired beauties, commende the good parts you haue. Went. Bith masse mine are very few. But. And win a kind of desire, as women are soone wonne to make you bee beloued where you shall firste kisse, then Woe, at length Wed, and at last bed my Noble harts. Both. O Butler. But. Wenches bona robes, blessed beauties, without colour or counterfet: Away, put on your best Cloaths, get you to the Barbers, Curle vp your haire, walke with the best strouts you can, you shal see more at the Window, and I ha vowd to make you. Bart. Wilt thou. But. Both Fooles, and Ile want of my wit but Ile doot. Bar. We wil liue together as felowes. Went. As Brothers. But. As arrant knaues if I keepe you company, O, the most wretched season of this time, These men like Fish, do swim within one streame, Yet theyd eat one another, making no Conscience To drinke with them theyd poyson, no offence, Betwixt their thoughts and actions haue controle, But headlong run, like an vnbiaest Bowle, Yet I will throw them on, but like to him, At play knowes how to loose, and when to win. Enter Thomas and Iohn Scarborrow. Tho. Butler. But. O, are you come. And fit as I appointed: so, tis wel, you knowe your kues, and haue instructions howe to beare your selues: Al, al is fit, play but your part, your states from hence are firme. Exit. Iohn. What shal I tearme this creature not a man. Betwixt this Butler leads Ilford in. Hees not of mortals temper but hees one, Made all of goodnes, tho of flesh and bone, O Brother, brother, but for that honest man, As neere to misery had bin our breath, As where the thundring pellet strikes is death, Tho. I, my shift of shirts and change of cloths knowt. Iohn. Well tel of him, like bels whose musick rings One Coronation day for ioy of Kings, That hath preseru'd their steeples not like towles, That summons liuing tears for the dead soules. Enter Butler and Ilford aboue. But. Gods preciour Sir, the hel Sir, euen as you had new kist, and were about to court her, if her Vncles be not come. Ilf. A plague on thee, spit out. But. But tis no matter Sir, stay you heere in this vpper chamber, &amp; Ile stay beneath with her, tis ten to one you shal hear them talke now, of the greatnes of her possessions, the care they haue to see her well bestowed, the admirablenes of her vertues, all which for all their comming, shall be but happines ordained for you, &amp; by my meanes be your inheritance. Ilf. Then thou't shift them away, and keepe from the sighte of them. But. Haue I not promist to make you. Ilf. Thou hast. But. Go to then, rest heere with patience, and be confident in my trust, onely in my absence, you may praise God for the blessednes you haue to come, and say your prayers if you will, Ile but prepare her hart for entertainement of your loue, dismisse them, for your free accesse, and returne straight. Ilf. Honest-blest-natural-friend, thou dealest with mee like a Btother: Butler, Exit. Sure heauen hath reserued this man to weare Grey-hairs to do me good, now wil I listen, listen close, and sucke in her Vncles words with a reioycing eare, Tho.

Ilf, And she were foule, being rich, I would be glad of her. But. Pisht, pisht. Io. Come, weele go visit her, but with this care, That to no spend-thrift we do marry her. Exeunt Ilf.

Well then, since you like her, and by my meanes, she shall like you, nothing rests now but to haue you married. Ilf. True Butler, but withall to haue her portion. But. Tut, thats sure yours when you are married once, for tis hirs by Inheritance, but do you loue her? Ilf. O, with my soule. But. Ha you sworne as much. Ilf.

And yet you hauing bin an open whoremaister, I will not beleeue you til I hear you sweare as much in the way of contract to her selfe, and call me to bee a witnesse. Ilf. By heauen, by earth, by Hell, by all that man can sweare, I will, so I may haue her. But. Enough. Thus at first sight, rash men to women sweare:, When such oaths broke, heauen greeues and sheds a teare: But shees come, ply her, ply her. Enter Scarborrowes Sister. Ilf.

Yet be in loue with me, let your affections Combine with mine, and let our soules Like Turtles haue a mutual Simpathy, Who loue so well, that they together die, Such is my life, who couets to expire, If it should loose your loue.

And Mistris Be this some comfort to your miseries, Ile ha thin cheekes, eare you shall ha wet eyes. Exeunt. Enter Scarrborrow. What is prodigallity? Faith like a Brush That weares himselfe to florish others cloathes, And hauing worne his hart euen to the stump, Hees throwne away like a deformed lump. Oh such am I, I ha spent all the wealth My ancestors did purchase, made others braue In shape and riches, and my selfe a knaue. For tho my wealth raisd some to paint their doore, Tis shut against me, saying I am but poore: Nay, euen the greatest arme, whose hand hath grast, My presence to the eye of Maiesty, shrinkes back, His fingers cluch, and like to lead, They are heauy to raise vp my state, being dead. By which I find, spend thriftes, and such am I, Like strumpets florish, but are foule within, And they like Snakes, know when to cast their skin. Enter Tho. Tho. Turne, draw, and dye, I come to kill thee. Scar. Whats he that speakes? Like sicknesse: Oh ist you, Sleepe still, you cannot mooue me, fare you well. Tho. Thinke not my fury slakes so, or my bloud Can coole it selfe to temper by refusall, Turne or thou dyest. Scar. Away. Tho. I do not wish to kill thee like a slaue, That taps men in their cups, and broch their harts, Eare with a warning peece they haue wakt their eares, I would not like to powder shoote thee downe, To a flat graue, ere thou hast thought to frowne: I am no Coward, but in manly tearmes, And fayrest oppositions vow to kill thee. Scar. From whence proceedes this heat. Tho. From sparkles bred by thee, that like a villain. Sca. Ha. Tho. Ile hallow it in thine eares till thy soule quake to heare it, That like a villain hast vndone thy brothers. Sca. Would thou wert not so neere me: yet farewell. Tho. By nature, and her lawes make vs a kinne, As neere as are these hands, or sin to sinne. Draw and defend thy selfe, or Ile forget Thou art a man. Scar. Would thou were not my Brother? Tho. I disclaime them. Scar. Are wee not off-spring of one parent wretch. Tho. I do forget it, pardon me the dead, I should deny the paines you bid for me. My blood growes hot for vengeance, thou hast spent My liues reuenewes that our parents purchast. Scar. O do not wracke me with remembrance ont. Tho. Thou hast made my life a Begger in this world, And I will make thee bankrout of thy breath: Thou hast bin so bad, the best I can giue, Thou art a Deuill, not with men to liue. Scar.

Brother I thanke you, for you now haue bin A patron of my life, forget the sinne I pray you, with my loose and wastfull houres, Hath made against your Fortunes, I repent em, And wish I could new ioynt and strength your hopes, Tho with indifferent ruine of mine owne. I haue a many sinnes, the thought of which Like finisht Needles pricke me to the soule, But find your wronges, to haue the sharpest point. If penitence your losses might repayre, You should be rich in wealth, and I in care. Tho. I do beleeue you Sir, but I must tell you, Euils the which are gainst an other done, Repentance makes no satisfaction To him that feeles the smart. Our father sir, Left in your trust my portion: you ha spent it, And suffered me (whilst you in ryots house, A drunken Tauerne, spild my maintainance Perhaps vpon the ground with ouerflowne cups, Like birds in hardest winter halfe starud, to flie) And picke vp any food, least I should die. scar. I prethee let vs be at peace together. Tho. At peace for what? For spending my inheritance, By yonder son that euery soule has life by, As sure as thou hast life Ile fight with thee. Scar. Ide not be moou'd vntoot. Tho. Ile kill thee then, wert thou now claspt Within thy mother, wife, or children armea. scar. Wouldst homicide? art so degenerat? Then let my blood grow hot. Tho. For it shall coole. scar. To kill rather then bee kild is manhoods rule. Enter Iohn Scarborrow. Io. Stay let not your wraths meet. Tho. Hart, what makst thou here? Io. Say who are you, or you, are you not one, That scarce can make a fit distinction Betwixt each other. Are you not Brothers? Tho. I renounce him. scar. Shalt not need. Tho. Giue way. scar. Haue at thee, Io. Who sturs, which of you both hath strength within his arm To wound his owne brest, whose so desperate, To dam himselfe by killing of himselfe, Are you not both one flesh? Tho. Hart, giue me way. sca. Be not a bar betwixt vs, or by my sword Ile mete thy graue out. Ioh. O do, for Gods sake do? Tis happy death, if I may die and you Not murther one another. O do but harken, When dus the Sunne and Moone borne in one frame Contend, but they breed Earthquakes in mens harts: When any starre prodigiously appeares, Tels it not fall of kings or fatall yeares. And then if Brothers fight, what may men thinke, Sinne growes so high, tis time the world should sinke. scar. My hart growes coole againe, I wish it not. Tho. Stop not my fury, or by my life I sweare, I will reueale the robbery we ha done, And take reuenge on thee, That hinders me to take reuenge on him. Io. I yeild to that, but neare consent to this, I shall then die as mine owne sinne affords, Fall by the law, not by my Brothers swords. Tho. Then by that light that guids me here I vow, Ile straight to Sir Iohn Harcop, and make knowne We were the two that robd him. Io. Prethy do. Tho. Sin has his shame, and thou shalt ha thy due. Exit. Io. Thus haue I shewne the nature of a Brother, Tho you haue prou'd vnnaturall to me. Hees gone in heare to publish out the theft, Which want and your vnkindnes forcst vs to, If now I die that death and publicke shame, Is a Corsiue to your soule, blot to your name. Exit. scar. O tis too true, theres not a thought I thinke, But must pertake thy greefes, and drinke A rellish of thy sorrow and misfortune, With waight of others teares I am ore borne, That scarse am Atlas to hold vp mine owne, And al to good for me. A happy Creature In my Cradle, and haue made my selfe The common curse of mankind by my life, Vndone my Brothers, made them theeues for bread, And begot pretty children to liue beggers, O Conscience, how thou are stung to thinke vpont, My Brothers vnto shame must yeeld their blood, My Babes at others stirrops beg their food, Or else turne theeues to, and be choakt fort, Die a Dogs death, be percht vpon a tree, Hang betwixt heauen and earth, as fit for neither, The curse of heauen thats due to reprobates, Discends vpon my Brothers, and my children, And I am parent to it, I, I am parent to it. Enter Butler. But. Where are you Sir? Scar. Why starest thou, whats thy hast? But. Heeres felowes swarme like flies to speake with you. Scar. What are they? But. Snakes I thinke Sir, for they come with stinges in theyr mouths, and their tongues are turnd to teeth to: They claw Villanously, they haue eate vp your honest name, and honourable reputation by railing against you, and now they come to deuoure your possessions. Scar. In playner Euargy, what are they, speake? But. Mantichoras, monstrous beastes, enemies to mankinde, that ha double rowes of teeth in their mouthes. They are Vsurers, they come yawning for mony, &amp; the Sheriffe with them, is come to serue an extent vppon your Lande, and then cease on your bodie by force of execution, they ha begirt the house round. Scar. So that the roofe our Auncestors did build For their sonnes comfort, and their wiues for Charity, I dare not to looke out. But. Besides Sir, heres your poore children. scar. Poore children they are indeede. But. Come with fire and water: teares in their eies, and burning greefe in their harts, and desire to speake with you. scar. Heape sorrow vpon sorrow? Tell me, are My brothers gone to execution? For what I did, for euery haynous sin, Sits on his soule by whom it did begin. And so did theirs by me. Tell me withall, My children carry moysture in their eyes, Whose speaking drops, say father, thus must we Aske our reliefe, or die with infamy, For you ha made vs beggers. Yet when thy tale has kild me to giue my passage comfort from this stage, Say all was done by inforst marriage: My graue will then be welcome. But. What shall we do sir? scar. Do as the deuill dus, hate panther-mankind, And yet I lie: for deuils sinners loue, When men hate men, tho good like some aboue. Enter Scarborrowes wife Katherine with two Children. But.
