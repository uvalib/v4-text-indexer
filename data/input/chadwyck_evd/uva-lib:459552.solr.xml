      <field name="fulltext">HERODES Princes, prelates of price, barronnes in blamner and byse, beware of mee, all that binne wise, that weldes all at my will. Saye noe man anythinge is his but onlye at my devyce; for all this world lyes to spare and eke to spill. My subjectes all that here bine settâ barrones, burges, and barronettâ bees bayne to mee, or you is lett, and at my biddinge bee. For leeves all this withouten lett, that I will doe as I have hett, marye that mysbegotten maremasett that thinkes to marre mee. And those false traytours that mee beheight to have commen agayne this same nighte, by another way have taken ther flight; this waye darst the not take. Therfore that boye, by God almight, shall be slayne soone in your sight, andâthough it be agaynst the rightâ a thousand for his sake. Alas, what purpose had that page that is soe yonge and tender of age, that would bereave my heritage, that am so micle of might? Forsooth that shrewe was wondrouse sage agaynst me anye warre to wage! That recked rybauld for all his rage shall not reve mee my right. But syth it may noe other bee but these kinges are gone from me, and that shrewe would have my soveraintye, I thinke to put him agayne: all the knave-children in this contree shall by his guile, soe mote I thee. Because I knowe not which is hee, all for his sake shalbe slayne. How, prettye Pratte, my messingere, come hither to me withouten weare! For thou must goe with hastye bere into Judee this daye after my doughtie and comely knightes, and bydd them hye with all there myghtes and that the lett for noe feightes. Bringe them withouten delaye. PRECO Yes, my lord of great renowne, to doe your hest I am bowne, lightly to leape over dale and downe and speede if I were there. Farewell, my lord in majestee, for on my jorney I will hye me. HERODE Now mightie Mahound be with thee, and ever to dwell in feare. PRECO How, awake out of your sleepe, syr Grymball and syr Lancherdeepe! And to me you take good keepe, for hether I am send; my lord, kinge Herode, begines to sowne for a shrewe would have his crowne and thus bereave him of his renowne, and soone would have him shend. PRIMUS MILES Welcome, messenger, that art soe gent. This tydinges which my lord hath sent they be welcome veryment. With thee nowe will I wend. SECUNDUS MILES Messinger, I will in good faye wend with you this ylke waye to here what my lord will saye, of this matter to make an end. PRECO Hayle, comly kynge sittinge on hye! Here bynne thy knightes common to thee that be men of greate degree to here of your talent. HEROD Messingere, for thy good deede right well shall I quite thy meede: have here of mee to doe thee speede right a gaye garmente. PRECO Grantmercye, lord regent; well am I pleased to myne intent. Mightye Mahound that I have ment keepe you in this steede! PRIMUS MILES Sir Lancherdeepe, what saye ye? This is the fayrest king that ever I see. SECUNDUS MILES This daye under the sunne shininge is there non soe seemely a kinge. PRIMUS MILES Hayle, comely kinge crowned in gould! Eche kinge and [kesar] kennes not your bett. If anye weare that with your grace feight would, such strokes for your sake sore should be sett. SECUNDUS MILES Yf him wee may take or gett, the devill ought him debt; and soe hee shalbe quitt such maystryes for to make. HERODE Welcome, our knightes that be so gent. Nowe will we tell you our intent, what is the cause we for you sent soe soone and hastelye. Yesterdaye to this cittie when wee weare in our royaltye, there came to us kinges three and tould us there intent to seeke a child that borne should bee, that was sayd by prophecye that should be kinge of Judee and manye another land. We gave them leave to search and see and come agayne to this cittie; and if hee weare of such degree, we would not him withstand. But and they had commen agayne, all three traytours should have binne slayne, and alsoe that lyther swayneâ and all for his sake. Out, alas, what may this bee? For I knowe not which is hee, therfore all knave-children in this contree, on them shall fall the wreake. For wee knowe not that child well, though wee therfore should goe to hell, all the children of Israell wee deeme them to be slayne. Counselour, what is thy reade? DOCTOR Deeme them, lord, for to be dead; for that is best, as eate I bread, to catch that lyther swayne. Command your knightes anon to hye, to goe to the land of Gallile and into the land of Judye, to slaye all that they may fynd. HERODE That was well sayd, my counselour. But yett I burne as doth the fireâ what for wroth, what for yreâ tyll this be brought to end. Therfore, my knightes good and keene, have done belyve; goe wreake my teene. Goe slaye that shrewe; lett yt be seene and you be men of mayne. Preeves manfully what they binne, that non awaye from you fleene. Dryve downe the dyrtie-arses all bydeene, and soone that there were slayne! So shall I keepe that vyle [congeon] that this would reave mee of my crowne. Therfore, my batchleres, make you bowne and found to save my righte. You must hye you out of this towne to Bethlem as fast as you mon. All knave-children, by my crowne, you must sley this nighte. PRIMUS MILES Alas, lord and kinge of blys, send you after us for this? A villanye yt weare, iwys, for my fellowe and mee to sley a shitten-arsed shrowe; a ladd his head [mighte] of hewe. For rybbottes are not in this rowe, but knightes of great degree. SECUNDUS MILES My leeffe lord of greate renowne, we shall wreake you yf wee mon. Whether hee be knight or champion stiffer than ever Sampson was, sickerly I shall dryve them downe. But for to kyll such a conjoyne mee shames sore, by saynct Mahound, to goe in any place. HERODE Nay, nay, it is neyther on nor two that you shall sley, as mott I goo, but a thousand and yett moo; takes this in your mynd. Because I knowe not which this shrewe ys, therfore, lest you of him mys, you must slaye, forsooth iwys, all that you may fynd. You shall walke farre and neere into Bethlem. Spare for no beere all knave-children within two yeere and on daye ould. Slea them downe both on and all. Soe shall you meete with that stall that would my kingdome clayme and call, and my welth alsoe welde. PRIMUS MILES Hit shalbe donne, lord, in hye; shall non be lefte witterlye. We shall goe search by and by in Bethlem all about, and wreake your teene full tenderly, leave non unslayne syckerly. Soe shall we soone that shrewe distroye, and keepe him in the rowte. Tunc ibunt milites simul. But lookes you rich you to aray; to Bethlem, that borrowe, I am bowne. With this speare I thinke to assaye to kyll manye a smale congeon. If anye blacke-lypped boyes be in my waye, they shall rewe yt, by Mahound, though all they world would saye nay, I myselfe shall dinge them all downe. If you will wytt what I height, my name is syr Waradrake the knight. Agaynst me dare no man fight, my dintes they so dreade. But fayne would I feight my fill, as fayne as facoune would flye, my lord to wreake at his will and make those dogges to dye. These congeons in there clowtes I will kill and stowtly with strokes them destroye. Shall never on skape by my will; all babbes for that boye, full sore shall they bye. Shall never non overpasse; of two yeres age and lesse; and this boy that kinge crowned wasâ shall non skape bout [scathe]. SECUNDUS MILES And I alsoe, without boasteâ though the kinge of Scottes and all his hoste were hereâI sett by there boaste, to dryve them downe bydeene. I slewe ten thousand upon a daye of kempes in there best araye; there was not on escaped awaye, my sword yt was so keene. Therfore to me you take good keepe; my name is syr Grymbald Lancherdeepe. They that mee teene I laye to sleepe on evirych a syde. I slewe of kempes, I understand, more then an hundreth thousand. Both on water and on land no man dare mee abyde. Through Bethlem I will springe, for I must nowe at your byddinge; right all downe shall I dinge these laddes everychone. And then that false geldinge that borne was soe yonge, hee shall for nothinge away from us gonne. PRIMUS MILES Farewell, my lord, and have good-daye. For hardly thus dare I sayeâ not for noe boast; in good faye, yt is not my manereâ I would I might fynd in my waye Sampsoun in his best araye, to looke whether I durst affraye to fight with him right here. HERODE Nay, nay, I knowe well or thou sweare that thou arte a doughtye man of warre; and though Sampsoun were here, soone hee should be slayne. But yett, yett my witt is in a were whether you shall fynd that losingere. But speedes you fast for my prayer, and hye you fast agayne. Tunc ibunt milites et veniet Angelus. ANGELUS Josephe, aryse and that anon; into Egipte thou must gonneâ and Marye alsoeâfrom your sonne. This is my lordes will. There staye, lest this child be slayne, tyll I warne thee to come agayne. False Herode would have you fayne, Jesus for to spill. JOSEPHE A, lord, blessed most thou bee. Thyder anon we will flye. Have we companye of thee, we will hye one our waye. ANGELUS Yea, companye we shall you beare tyll that you be commen there. Herode buskes him you to deare as fast as ever hee maye. JOSEPHE Marye, suster, now we must flytt; upon my asse shall thou sytt, into Egipte that wee hitt. The angell will us leade. MARIA Syr, evermore lowd and still your talent I shall fulfill. I wott yt is my lordes will; I doe as you me read. ANGELUS Come nowe forth in Godes name. I shall you sheild from all shame; and you shall see, my leeffe dame, a thinge to your likinge. For mahometes both on and all, that men of Egipt godes can call, at your comminge downe shall fall when I beginne to synge. Tunc ibunt et Angelus cantabit, âEcce dominus ascendet super nubem levem, et ingrediatur Egiptum, et movebuntur simulachra Egipti a facie domini exercituumâ; et si fueri poterit, [cadet] aliqua statua sive imago. PRIMUS MILES Have donne, fellowes, [hie] fast, that these queanes weare downe cast, and the children in thrust; and kyll them all to clowetes! SECUNDUS MILES Yea, syr, we dwell to longe; therfore goe we them amonge. They hopen to have some wronge that gonne soe fast about us. PRIMUS MULIER Whom callest thou âqueane,â scabde dogge? Thy dame, thy daystard, was never syche. Shee burned a kylne, eych stike; yet did I never non. SECUNDUS MULIER Bee thou soe hardye, I thee behett, to handle my sonne that is so sweete, this distaffe and thy head shall meete or wee heathen gonne. PRIMUS MILES Dame, abyde, and lett mee see a knave-child if that yt bee. The kinge hase commanded me all such for to areste. PRIMA MULIER Arest? Ribott, for-thee thou lyes, by my lewtye. Therfore I read fast that thou flee and lett mee have my peace. SECUNDUS MULIER Saye, rotten hunter with thy gode, stytton stallon, styck-tode. I reade that thou no wronge us bode lest thou beaton bee. Wherto should we longer fode? Laye we on them large lode. There bassnetts be bygge and broade; beates on now, letts see. SECUNDUS MILES Dame, thy sonne, in good faye, hee must of me learne a playe: hee must hopp, or I goe awaye, upon my speare ende. PRIMA MULIER Owt, owt, and weale-awaye, that ever I abyd this daye! One stroke yett I will assaye to give or that I wend. SECUNDA MULIER Owt, owt on thee, theife! My love, my lord, my life, my leife, did never man or woman greiffe to suffer such torment! But yet wroken I will bee. Have here on, two, or three. Beare the kinge this from me; and that I yt him sennd. PRIMUS MILES Come hither to me, dame Parnell, and shewe me here thy sonne snell. For the kynge hase byd mee quell all that we fynd mon. PRIMUS MULIER My sonne? Nay, stronge theiffe. For as I have good preeffe, do thou my child any greiffe, I shall cracke thy crowne. Tunc Miles trasfodiet primum puerum et super lancea accipiet. Owt, owt, and woe is me! Theeffe, thou shall hanged be. My chyld is dead; now I see my sorrowe may not cease. Thow shall be hanged on a tree and all thy fellowes with thee. All the men in this contree shall not make thy peace. Have thou this, thou fowle harlott and thou knight, to make a knott! And on buffett with this bote thou shalt have to boote. And thow this, and thou this, though thou both shyte and pisse! And if thou thinke we doe amysse, goe buskes you to moote. SECUNDUS MILES Dame, shewe thou me thy child there; hee must hopp uppon my speare. And hit any pintell beare, I must teach him a playe. SECUNDA MULIER Naye, freake, thou shalt fayle; my child shall thou not assayle. Hit hath two hooles under the tayle; kysse and thou may assaye. Be thou soe hardy, styck-toode, to byde any wronge or boade! For all thy speach and thy goade, I read yee do but good. For and thou do me any harme or my child upon my arme, I shall found to keepe thee warme, bee thou never so wood. Tunc Secundus Miles transfodiet secundum puerum. Owt, owt, owt, owt! You shalbe hanged, the rowte. Theves, be you never so stout, full fowle you have donne. This child was taken to me to looke to. Theves, who binne yee? Hee was not myne, as you shall see; hee was the kinges sonne. I shall tell while I may drey: his child was slayne before my eye. Theeves, ye shall be hanged hye, may I come to his hall. But or I goe, have thou one, and thou another, syr John! For to the kinge I will anon to playne upon you all. Tunc ibit ad Herodem. Loe, lord, looke and see the child that thou tooke mee. Men of thy owne contrey have slayne ytâhere the bine. HERODES (iratus) Fye, hoore, fye! God give the pyne! Why didest thou not say that child was myne? But yt is vengeance, as drinke I wyne, and that is now well seene. SECUNDA MULIER Yes, lord, they see well right thy sonne was like to be a knight. For in gould harnesse hee was dight, paynted wonders gaye. Yett was I never so sore afright, when the theire speares through him thright; lord, so little was my might when they beganne to fraye. HERODES Hee was right sycker in silke araye, in gould and pyrrie that was so gaye. They might well knowe by this daye he was a kinges sonne. What the divell is this to saye? Whye weare thy wyttes soe farre awaye? Could thow not speake? Could thou not praye and say yt was my sonne? Alas, what the divell is this to meane? Alas, my dayes binne now donne! I wott I must dye soone. Booteles is me to make mone, for dampned I must bee. My legges roten and my armes; that nowe I see of feindes swarmesâ I have donne so many harmesâ from hell comminge after mee. I have donne so much woo and never good syth I might goo; therfore I se nowe comminge my foe to fetch me to hell. I bequeath here in this place my soule to be with Sathanas. I dye now; alas, alas! I may no longer dwell. Tunc faciet signum quasi morietur et veniet Demon. DEMON Warre, warre, for now unwarely wakes your woo! For I am swifter then is the rowe. I am commen to fetch this lord you froe, in woe ever to dwell. And with this crocked crambocke your backes shall I clowe; and all false beleevers I burne and lowe, that from the crowne of the head to the right tooe I leave noe right whole fell. From Lucifer, that lord, I am sent to fetch this kinges sowle here present into hell, there to bringe him, there to be lent, ever to live in woe; ther fyre burnes bloe and brent. Hee shall there be, this lord, verament. His place evermore therein is hent, his bodye never to goe froe. No more shall you trespas. By my lewtye, that filles there measures falselye shall beare this lord companye; the gett none other grave. I will you bringe thus to woe, and come agayne and fetch moe as fast as I maye goe. Farewell, and have good-daye. Exit Demon. ANGELUS Joseph, aryse, and that in hye, for dead is now your enimye. Take Jhesu, the child, and eke Marye and wend into Judye. Herode, that would have had you slayne, hee is marred, both might and mayne. Therfore hyes you whome agayne; in peace now you shall be. JOSEPHE A, lord that madest all of nought, yt is skyll thy will be wrought. Now is hee dead that us hase sought; we shall never cease tyll that we a whome bee agayne in our countree. Now hope we well to live in lee and in full great peace. Marye, sister, we must goe to our land that we came froe. The angell hase bydden us soe, my owne deare sweete. On my asse thou shalt bee and my mantell under thee, full easylie, sister, leeve thou mee and that I thee behett. MARIA I thanke you, syr, as I can. Helpe me that I weare upon. Hee that is both God and man keepe us in this tyde. JOSEPHE Come hither, deare hart-roote; I shall soone be thy boote. Thou shalt soonne ryde eych foote, and I will goe by thy syde. ANGELUS Nowe you be readye for to goeâ Josephe and Marye alsoeâ forsooth I will not departe you froe but helpe you from your foe. And I will make a melodie, and singe here in your companye a worde was sayd in prophecye a thousands yeares agoe: âEx Egipto vocavi Filium meum, ut salvum faciet populum meum.â Finis</field>
