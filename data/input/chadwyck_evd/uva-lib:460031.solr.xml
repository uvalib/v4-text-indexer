      <field name="fulltext">IBRAHIM, THE Thirteenth Emperour OF THE TURKS: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable RICHARD MINCHALL, of Bourton, Esq;.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Spoken by Mrs. Cross. I'm hither sent, but Heaven knows what to say, Or how t'excuse a dull Heroick Play; Here's nor poignant Repartee, nor taking Raillery, No Feast for Critick Pit, or Graduate Gallery. No Beau, who in his very affected Dress, Does all the Nonsense of his Character express; This Play on solid History depends, Old fashion'd stuff, true Love, and faithful Friends. The Pit our Author dreads as too severe, The ablest Writers scarce find Mercy there; Her only hopes in yonder brightness lies, If we read praise in those Commanding Eyes: What rude Blustering Critique then will dare To find a fault, or contradict the Fair? Th'humble Offering at your Feet she lays, Nor wishes she to live without your Praise: Strict Rules of Honour still she kept in view, And always when she wrote, she thought on you. Then Ladies own it, let not Detracters say, You'll not protect one harmless, modest Play. The Hero to our Sex is still inclin'd, Securing you, we're sure of all Mankind. If in that charming Circle you will oft appear, An Empty House we sha'n't have cause to fear.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. At a distance: The Mufti and Mustapha appear. Near the Audience Achmet and several Eunuchs Enter. Ach. Haste each Attendant to perform his several charge With strictest diligence, and most observant care; Burn the SabÃ¦an Gums, and all those rich Perfumes Where our great Master passes, till every Room Smell sweet as Altars laden with Incense To the Heathen Gods, spread the gay Persian Carpets For his Royal Feet, and you to the Apartments fly Of those Incloister'd Virgin Roses, the select and chosen Beauties of the habitable World, bid 'em prepare, Quick let 'em in all their brightest glories be array'd, For their Sun, the Mighty Ibrahim approaches. [Exit Achmet, the Eunuchs follow. The Mufti and Mustapha come forward. Mufti. Now, by our Prophet, what's all this but gaudy Pageantry, Ill acted Scenes of Pomp and show, instead of real greatness: O my Friend it was not thus of old, The great Forefathers of this degenerate Man, Instead of treading on Persian Carpets, Trod upon the Necks of Persian Kings: Whilst now (curs'd reverse of time) softness and ease, Flatterers and Women, fill alone our Monarch's Heart; Women enough to undo the Universal World Are here maintain'd, whole useless hundreds, And with such a train of Pride and Luxury, That Eyes before ne'er saw, nor can endless words describe: Wou'd you believe it? the Vultures deckt in Painted Plumes, So eager are for their vain trappings, That soon as a Merchant Ship salutes the Port, His Goods are seiz'd, and brought to the Seraglio Without Account, Value, or Justice, yet at this The Pander Visier winks, whilst the poor Owner Waits in vain for Answer or Redress. Must. Most just Observer, as well as Teacher of our Laws, By me in Friendship like a Brother lov'd, In counsel like a Father honour'd, That what you have said is most undoubted truth, The Impartial World must own. But these complaints Alas, avail not, our Lord hates us his faithful Servants, And whatever we shou'd offer, wou'd certainly despise. Muft. You are too good, my Must. to be a Favourite here, Though so long Married to the Royal Sister of our Emperour; Nay, in this base Court, your Son, the God-like Amurat, But coldly is receiv'd, because his wondrous Youth Has so far out-strip'd their sloathful Ageâ O! Pity! that the fairest branch of all the Ottoman Race, Sprung from a Female Root; yet I swear Were he Lord of all that our Tyrannick Master holds, I cou'd not esteem him more, or love him better. Few Kings his Courage e'er obtain'd, or Vertues; O 'tis Nobler far a Crown to Merit, than a Crown To wear. Must. Happy's my Son in such a Patron, Who never ceases to oblige; I know your kind Attendance Now is on his behalf, to speak his Actions In the Sultans Ear, so as may obtain his Royal favour. Muft. It is indeed my chief designâ But oh! Manly Vertue, Courage unequall'd, Fortitude, and all those Graces that adorn The glorious Amurat, are truths displeasing To our Ibrahim, whose soft Soul destructive Beauty charms into a sleep too sound For the Report of Noble Deeds to wake. Must. The Visier is the Minion Hangs the darling of his heart, And with ill Counsel poysons Every design that tends towards Vertue. Muft. Then that vile Woman, to whom He hath given the sweet Name Of Sheker Para, she, with the Visier, Joins to ruin Ibrahimâ Must. Whilst he, contrary to our Countries Laws, Exposes her to publick view, lets her converse With Visier, Bashaws, or whom she pleases. Muft. But that I have a Daughter, Whose early Vertue and sincere Obedience, Ties my Soul to dote upon: I for my Countries sake wou'd Curse the Sex. Must. That Daughterâ Muft. No more, the Emperours Guards appear, And see the Visier, and the Woman at his Elbow. Enter Ibrahim, the Grand Visier, Sheker Para, Achmet, and several Attendants. Ibrah. I say the Bashaw's Treason is plain, Therefore Morat, attend him with the Bow-string, And my fatal Orderâthat without a murmur He surrender Life for his Ill-gotten Wealth. 'Tis thine, my faithful, vigilant Azema. Vis. O sacred Sir, whose Justice is Divine, And 'twould be Impious to affirm The Bashaw of Damascus hath one Grain of Innocence; Yet let me beg you wou'd hold that bounteous hand, The only Wealth I covet is to be my Sultans Slave. Besides, I have many Enemies, and these high favours Will I fear create me more. Ibrah. Who dares to be thy Enemy? No, Visier, Whilst I protect thee, Kings shall for thy Friendship sue; And let thy Foes remember what I commanded last. Vis. O let me throw my self beneath your Royal Feet, And kissing your honour'd Robes, disclose The Adoration that my heart is full of. Muft. Fawning Sycophant! [Aside. Ibra. Rise, good Azema! no more! Muft. Great Sir, I have a Suit to you. Ibra. What is't, my Religious Councellor? Muft. Not for my self, but one much more deserving, Your Godlike General Amurat, who brings Your Conquering Forces back from vanquisht Babylon, Now lies Incamp'd near this Imperial City: Next Spring, by your Commands, and his desires, He goes to Candia, to punish that stubborn Town, Which dares resist the Ottoman Armies that are Invincible. By me he humbly prays your Royal License, That this Winter he may remain At his own Palace here in Constantinople. Ibra. I'll consider his desiresâbut at this time Let all, except my Eunuchs, and my Sheker Para, Leave meâ [Exit &amp;c. Come, my loved Sheker, what hast thou prepar'd To calm and tune my Soul, which these affairs Have ruffled from its own Sphere of Ease and Pleasureâ Shek. To charm my Monarch is the only study and Business of your Slave, and to that end, Twenty fair Virgins, whom yet your Eyes ne'er saw, I have pick'd and chosen from a thousand, And set in order for your view. Ibra. Thanks my good Girl, 'tis by these obliging turns That thou secur'st the heart of Ibrahim. Give me that grateful Mistress, Who when her Lover, sated with that high Luscious Feast, Enjoyment, she for his Sickly Appetite Generously prepares fresh Viands; I but tast of them, my solid part, My Friendship that remains with thee. Ach. Now let each Ambitious Maid disclose the Gifts. Of Art and Nature, whether in Voice, or Tuneful Motion the taking beauty lies; With Emulation let it be practis'd o'er To charm the Worlds great Lord. The Scene draws and discovers the Ladies set in Order for the Sultans Choice, who takes out his Handkerchief, and walks round them; whilst Sheker Para talks to Achmet. Sheker. How different, Achmet, is this from the European stories; I have read there, twenty Heroes for the Ladies Burn and die, here twenty Ladies for the Hero. Ach. It shows that Mankind maintains his Charter Better here, yet loses sure the sweetness Of submissive love; see, he seems fixt. Shek. Noâthe Handkerchief is not dropt yet, And she's left to use her own. Ach. Now 'tis resolvedâ [The Sultan drops his Handkerchief, which the Lady falling prostrate, kisses, and takes up, and is led off by two Eunuchs; the Sultan following, the Scene shuts upon the rest. Shek. Oh Achmet! O my faithful Slave! If e'er thou lov'st thy generous Mistress Who has from nothing raised thee And plac'd thee in the highest Orb that thou canst move For wanting Manhood, though thy Soul's all God-like, Yet thou canst not rise to greater honours, Help me now; thou know'st my raging fires How Passion like a Vultur preys upon my heart, And the hot flames of love drink up my Spirits, All this, I say, thou know'st, and yet bringst No Remedy. Ach. True, when these Convulsive Fits are on ye, I from your ravings learn you love the General Amurat, Nor have I been unmindful, even of thoseâ Imperfect hints; But the Physician that pretends to administer a Cure, Must each particular of the Distemper know. Shek. O! I have told thee, o'er and o'er. Repetition wrecks my Soulâ Yet thou shalt hear't again, Full well thou know'st the Sultan gives me greater Privilege Than ever Woman had in the Ottoman Court; That has undone me, for there I have seen This Robber of my rest, this cruel charming Amurat. Ach. Knows he his Happyness? Sheck. Yes, Yes, for I have stole a thousand burning Glances, And sent them to his heart Besides sweet herbs, and Amorous Flowers (Those Hieroglyphicks, and Emblems of our Countrys love) In Boxes wrought with gold and set in Jewels Of unequall'd value, he hath oft received; Yet still he Ignorance pretends, nor meets my Eyes But turns his own another wayâ Or else looks guilty down. Ach. What stoick vertue rules in his cold Icy Veins, And gives him power to resist those Eyes? Or has another gain'd his heart? Shek. Cou'd I find out that, revenge wou'd take the place Of Injur'd Love, and I shou'd weep no more; Revenge, sweet Revenge, Injuries, Antidote, Wronged Womens darling Joyâ The Emperour thinks perhaps, Because I share him with a hundred Rivals My Nature's tame. No, No! We easily give what we despise But shou'd another be ador'd by my Amurat Whilst neglected I despair, How wou'd I wrack her, how glut me With the ruine of their Loves, and them! Ach. This I have observ'd, that since his Incamping near He often in disguise repairs to this great Town; But whether Ambition or Love bring him, I know Not, for I cou'd never learn his Counsels. Shek. That, dear Achmet, be thy future care, And name thy own reward. But how canst thou effect it, Hath thy prolifick brain yet laid a form? Ach. Yes, thusâ You know our Princes for State Are still attended by their Mutes, who Follow into all their Privacies As being unable to divulge them; one of these Is near my Stature. Him will I draw aside, knock out his brains, And in his habit watch the Princes Motions. Shek. Now! AmuratâExcellent! The time draws near to quench these raging fires, In full possession of my fierce desires; Or else the ungrateful object I'll destroy, Which rob'd my Nights of rest, my Days of Joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Amurat, Solyman. Soly. This is not sure that Amurat Who foremost scaled the Walls of Babylon, And cry'd aloud, Come on, who fears to die, Deserves itâyet at a Letter now pauses, Stops, turns pale, and seems to grow upon the Earth he treads. Am. Thou art no judge, my Friend, you never loved, Nor sure none ever loved like me, If I acquir'd glory, 'twas for Morena's sake That she might not despise meâ Nor have I more to do if she is lost. Soly. You terrify your self with groundless fears, Nor can I from the Mufti's Letter Discern a danger threatning towards your love Am. Oh Solyman! forgive the frailty of your Friend, Forgive the follies that Imperious love creates, Here the Mufti writes, that on earnest business He craves my presence, if he hath discover'd The Adoration that I pay his beauteous Daughter, And then forbid it, how lost a thing is Amurat, For I know well, though her poor Slave shou'd suffer A thousand wracks, she'd tread the rigid paths of Duty, And let me die, rather than forfeit her obedience. Soly. The Guard our Country lays on that fair charming Sex Causes my wonder, how you have lov'd thus long conceal'd. Am. Kind Heav'n who saw my faithful suffering heart, In pity thus disposed it, a trusty Slave at the Transporting hours of silent Night still gave Me admittance To a Garden, which her Apartment overlook'd, There, at that awful distance, did I Kneel, Sent up my Vows with such an ardent zeal Till at length I melted the heart of my fair Listening Goddess; And she from thence, as from an upper Orb of bliss Sent down sweet words, and answering sighs, The long expected Manna, for which with such An Eagerness, I had prayedâAh Souldier! cou'd I impart But one grain of this fierce passion which invades My Soul, to thee; you no more wou'd wonder If I almost Conquer'd Impossibilities to see Morena Mark, how the flushing joy leaps to my Cheeks, Oh! if her very name causes such boundings in my blood, What wou'd her sight, what to press her in my Arms, And tast her rosy Lips! excess of Joy wou'd work The Effects of grief; and I shou'd fall a Victim At her feet. Soly. Where Heaven gives the greatest hearts We still the greatest Passions find, And 'tis the brave alone love most and best. Am. My Dear Indulgent Friend, farewel, At the usual Rendezvouz I'll be Within few hours; and we'll return Together to the Camp. Soly. Prosperity attend your Wishes. [Exeunt severally. Enter the Mufti, and Mustapha, Amurat meets them attended, amongst his Attendants Achmet. Must. Welcome Noble Youth, you're most welcome here, Nor is your request forgot, though not obtain'd, For your appearing publickly. Am. Where shall I pay my duty first? Or which way Kneel? each is a Father, And each too good for Amurat. Must. Most sure my Son, you never can Enough acknowledge the bounties Of this Reverend Man; whose early care Shelter'd thy tender youthâ From the rough Blasts of Tyranny And Faction, and by his Eloquence Still render'd thee as now thou standest, Favourite to the Prince, and People. Muft. My Friends, ye over-rate my Endeavours To serve, and kindly take the will where power is wanting. No, 'tis not I, 'tis our great Master, to whom Half the Earth bows down their servile Necks: Who, with one Almighty nod, can give a little World Away, 'tis he shou'd Amurat reward, and bestow A Kingdom, as his Valour due; yet lovely Royal Warrior, if I have rightly found The secret of thy heart, there is a present In my power, which equal to a Crown you'll prize. Morena Entering. Am. Ha!â Muft. Come forth, Morena, my Ages Darling, And my hearts delight; Joy of my Eyes, Lov'd object of all my Earthly hopes, Lend me thy hand, and smile upon thy Father When he gives thee to thy Wishes. Am. Where am I? Thou transporting Image that dances thus Before my dazled Eyes, art thou real? Oh! that at the emptying half my Veins, I were convinc'd this is no Dream. Muft. I saw your secret Love, watch'd the kindling fires, And blest 'em as they sprang. Had I disapprov'd They had been prevented e'er risen to a mutual flame, But take her, Son, and Eternal Blessings Crown ye both. Must. He is already blest, what Monarch wou'd not forego An universal sway for such a charming Maid? Am. Speak Goddess, speak! Angel, speak! Let your sweet Voice confirm my Happiness, That my beating heart may force its passage Through my Breast, and fly to yours! Mor. O Amurat! spare my Tongue and Cheeks The shame of owning what my Soul is full of; And by my past Love, judge my present Joy! Ach. Aside. Thy future Misery I can read. Am. 'Tis so, and I am blest above all humane kind: Reign, reign, ye unenvy'd Monarchs! Fight for this Dunghil Earth, and let The blood of thousand thousand Wretches, Whom daily your Ambition Sacrifices, Lie heavy on your guilty heads, Whilst I, blest with this fair Heaven of Innocence, This matchless, lovely, charming Creature, More Worth than Indies joyn'd to Indies; Than all the Sun e'er sees: am Happier Than a fancy'd God. Mor. Cease these transports, my lov'd Lord, Least fate grow angry at our Joys Excess, And Dash them with Eternal Woes. Muft. Make hast, my Son, in your return To the Camp, for fear the Emperour Shou'd Discover our private meeting. Within few days, You will return with his Permission, And from my Arms, receive the lov'd Morena Into yours! [Exeunt Mufti and Mustapha. Am. Oh Morena! my Morena, Now Permit me to approach, and swear Upon thy snowy bosom, how much I love thee, till with warm sighs I've thaw'd thy Virgin Icy Heart, And made it burn like mine. Mor. What Maid can hear, and be unmov'd, The Man she loves talk at this charming rate; But Oh! I've read, that Men are all by Nature False; and this dear pleasing tale of love, To which I listen with such rapture, Will hereafter be, perhaps, Word for Word Repeated to another. Am. Never, Morena, never. No, here kneeling in the Face of Heaven I swear, that though our Law allows Plurality of Wives And Mistresses, yet I will never practise it; May Dishonour wrap my head with shame Instead of Laurels; may I be beaten Through the Army I command, and branded for a Coward, When I admit another Love into my Bed or Bosom; Let our great Master be Spectator of my Infamy, And after that let me live. Mor. Hold, my dear Lord, fain wou'd I say something too To answer all this wondrous love, Were there a Man Valiant, good like my Amurat, And greater than our mighty Sultan, yet wou'd I Be torn in thousand pieces, rather than Break my Plighted Faith. Am. No more my Life, what need of Oaths When Love Cements our Hearts. O! let me tast a parting Kiss, The sweet memory of which Will wing my swift return. Mor. What mean these tremblings here? Why come these sighs uncall'd? I knowâI think I know You wont break your Vow. Am. Shall I swear again, Never. Yet closer to thy heart. By all these Virgin favours, never. Here I set up my rest, and plant my Endless Joys On this fair work of Nature; When thou was't form'd, curious Heaven Smil'd at the Exact Creation, And every power was pleas'd. Oh! I am fix'd For ever, till glory force me from thy Arms, Then in all the Hazards of tempestuous War, Thou, the Auspicious Star that I'll invoke, Morena's Name shall guide my Sword to Conquest, And after those Laborious Toils, eager and longing For my bliss, the Laurels I have gain'd, At thy feet I'll lay, Crown'd with thy love And reigning in thy heart; Such Raptures my transported Soul will seize, I here shall find our Mahomet's Paradise. Enter Sheker Para, and Mirra her Slave. Shek. Now is fate at work for me: Achmet that busy Engine, that darling useful Eunuch, Close as his genius traces my Hero's secret steps, And on his Discovery my tortur'd Life depends. If Amurat's aspiring Soul is only full of Plots To raise him higher, fixt above the Visiers Power, And faster in our Empires Honours, I am happy, For I can further his Ambition; and he in gratitude Must pay me back with Love, but Oh! I fear The Victorious Prince full of charms, and blooming youth, Is rather on the chase of Beauty, then he obtains The glorious quarry, for though cast in a CÅlestial Mould How cou'd a Nymph Divine resist him? Mir. Madam whilst you talk as if in dreams Of Heavenly, and Imaginary Beauty, You forget your own; the Prince I dare Presume to affirm, fears to offer, doubting, What he wishes, your Encouragement, and Dreading our Sultan. You, Madam, know 'Tis safter far Razing Imperial Cities Than aiming at a Mistress possess'd, And valu'd by the mighty Ibrahim. Shek. True, Mirra, I have charm'd the wandring God More variable than the Heathens Jove, He darts but like a falling Star upon The yielding fair, dissolves, and then To her is seen no more; yet his Soul Is rivetted to mine, hangs on the Musick Of my tongue, nay late at my request For the first blossoms of the early year, he gave The obliging donor, the rich Kingdom of Natolia: I look down on the Sultana Queens, despise Their Pregnancy, and want of power. Mir. The Astonish'd World sees your amazing height, And justly pays to you their Adoration. Shek. Ah Flatterer, to what hast thou betray'd me, Whilst my boasting tongue swells with this Vain story; my trembling foolish loving heart Beats Alarm and presages all my hopes destroyed. Enter Achmet, in a Mutes Habit. Ha! Achmet, thy dress, thy looks, thy hast, Discover thy Faith and DiligenceâOh Quickly ease my tortur'd Soul! Ach. Madam, your last and Chief desire was To see the Prince: if that's Effected You must not stay to hear what I have learnt; He passes, this moment through the remotest Gallery That leads towards the Bosphorus, there I suppose his Galley waits him, this Key Shortens your walk, and you may Meet him in the open space. Shek. Fly Achmet, to my Cabinet, and shift thee there Then wait till my returnâ I dare not ask theeâis he a Lover? Ach. Madam, he is; if you stay to hear more You cannot see him. Shek. Yes, I will see him; though ten thousands ruine Hung upon the fatal Interview! [Exit. The Scene changes to the prospect of the Sea. Enter Amurat Mufled in his Robe. Am. to one Attend. See here abouts for Solyman. [Sheker Para, meets him. Curst accidentâhow shall I avoid her. Shek. Ha! Mirra? is not that our CÅlebrated General? Mir. Doubtless, Madam, his very motion shews him He cannot shroud his Glories. Am. Excuse me Ladies; a business Relating only to my self, call'd me for some Moments hither, without our Lords Permission. Shek. And is this the way we receive our Conquerours? Old Rome granted Ovations Triumphs To such exalted Vertue, drawn in the gaudy Chariot The Noble warriors march'd a long, kindling In the bright gazing Virgins loves soft fires, And in the wandring youths Wars fierce Martial Heats, if through our crowded streets Mounted high on Persian ruines, Successful Amurat were to pass (Pardon My blushes) when I say I think not Rome's Fam'd CÃ¦sar, or her darling Pompey, cou'd Be more admir'd, esteem'd, or lov'd. Am. When a Lady praises, I am Dumb. Shou'd a Man say this, I must call it Flattery, and I'll resent it. Shek. Fames Trumpet blows aloud, I Catch but the Echo, and repeat it faintly, Yet I cou'd wish my self an Emulator In your glory, a Man, your Companion In the War, for something I wou'd do To gain your Friendship; prevent The lifted Arm of fate, and in my Breast Receive some wound design'd for you. Am. War, with its rough Idea, ought not Madam, To Disturb your gentler mind, by varying Nature order'd the sweet mansion of love And soft desires. Shek. But Almighty Nature sometimes fills Our Souls with both: as I Ambitious Look up to War, so you methinks, Too Godlike Hero, might look down to love. Am. 'Tis looking upwards, Madam, surely When we think of love; for beauty The resemblance bears of Heaven, Love is a pleasing Theme, but I must Indulge my Ears no longer, least I forget my Duty, which in my swift Return's exprest. [Is going. Shek. Fly not with such unwelcome hast. If you are pleased with any thing That I can say, I'll take care for Your excuse, or stay. Am. Madam, I have left the Army without Their necessary Orders, I cannot now Accept your offer'd favour. Shek. Let Confusion be Instead of Order If your heart's like mine; for mine is all Tumultuous, Oh General! Awe me not with thy blushes, For I have lov'd thee longâYou Perhaps despise the Jewel, because 'tis offer'd, But know Visier Bashaws, the greatest Of our Port, in vain have beg'd a smile. Am. To the greatest in the Port, and World; Your smiles are due, and I injure him When I hear this. Farewel. [Exit. Shek. Gone! O Devil! Keep down, thou swelling Heart! Or higher rise, that I may tear Thee with my teeth! Mirva! Break all the flattering Mirrors! Let me ne'er behold this rejected Face again! Have I seen Scepter'd Slaves kneeling At my feet, forgetting they were Kings, Forgetful of their Gods, calling alone on me; Passing whole days and hours as if measur'd With a Moments Sand, and now refus'd By a Curst Beardless Boy! my Arms too Open'd, all my Charms laid forth! (for The Joys of Love are double, when our Sex desires) heedless and cold he flew From my Embrance; swift as I will do To form his ruineâAchmet! I come! 'Tis he must raise this raging Tempest higher, Though cold to me, his Bosom's sure on fire. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Sheker Para, followed by Achmet. Shek. Enough, Oh Achmet!âHold! for I can bear no more, And yet the Inquisitive Soul, set on mischief, And bent for ruine, hangs on the fatal story, Though every Period gives me Death. âWas my Curst Rival Fair? For of her Beauty, you have nothing said; Or else I left that part unheeded. Achm. Fair!ânot opening Flowers, Not the first streaks of rising Day, Not Painted Angels are half so Charming! Eternal smiles still Grace her Cheeks, And Majesty her Eyes; a Thrilling Musick Is in her Voice; which touches every vital, And teaches hearts to dance. Shek. I have it now! Her Beauty then be her destruction; ButâGreat Talkers seldom Act, and mighty words Are mighty nothings; like the Crackling Thunder, Which makes Women fear but seldom harms: 'Tis the thinking Mind that in her own dark Cell Revolves, and then performsâ Where's the Sultan and the Visier? Achm. The Sultan's retir'd to his Repose; The Visier in his Apartment alone. Shek. Faithful Achmet! take this Jewelâ And think thy wretched Mistress loves thee, Though her thoughts are now too full To Express itâ Thrown, like a neglected Flower from the Bosom, Where I wou'd have flourished, How quickly shall I fade! Yetâ With the First Angels Expell'd I'll try To draw Morena down, that Saint above, To my black Region of Despair! Achm. Though she has Charms, wou'd stop the fury Of our Barbarous Troops, when they take A Christian Town; yet I cou'd flea her lovely Face With my Keen Dagger; extinguish those Shining Lights, her Eyes, to Revenge my Patroness! Shek. Yes, Rival!â Of thy Vow'd Constancy, I'll tryal make; And thou shalt suffer, for thy Lovers sake! If Amurat Thou Lovest to that degree, My sweet Revenge will then compleated be; For I'll take care to spoil the Worshipt Shrine, And tear Thy Heart, as thou hast tortur'd mine! The Visier sitting by a Table, whereon lie Books of Account, Rises. Vis. What is't to amass these mighty sums of Wealth, To be daily crowded with presents from European Kings, To Command on Land, and Sea, next to our Lord, Whilst yet I stand unsafe between these Rocks Of Regulating the People, and a Tyrant Prince! All those bitter curses which they dare not shoot At Ibrahim, fall thick on me, the Mufti, And Mustapha, that Aga of the Janizaries, Are two I hate, the first, because Like other Churchmen, instead of Prayers, He studies Politicks; in vain they Preach Humility, and teach us to look up for Crowns above: When we behold them fix'd on these below, And more ambitious than the Kings that wear 'em, The Aga's Son, that hot-brain'd Youth, Amurat, Who dares fight, and therefore scorns to bow, Or seek my favour: These have censur'd me, And on these I'll be reveng'dâ Enter Sheker Para behind him. Shek. On whom is't thou art studying revenge, Old Statesman! would'st thou have it better, Deep and secure; take a Woman with thee! âOr Bloody, as thy remorseless Heart can frame, Still take a Woman's Counsel! Butâ Say, Arem, who is mark'd for Vengeance? Vis. To you, I think, I may discloseâFor All your Foes are mine, and mine are yoursâ The Mufti and Mustapha look awry on our Actions, Sowing Sedition instead of wholsome Doctrine. Shek. By Heaven! The very same these are, Those I wou'd destroyâAnd for that purpose Sought you nowâI've laid a Trainâ Which wants but your assistance to o'erthrow 'em all. Vis. Name it, fair Charmer, quickly! Shek. This old Crafty Priest conceals a Daughter, Whose Beauty, I am told, without the help of Flattery, (Eccels her Sex) to Ibrahim. The Charming wonders I'll relate! Set his Amorous Soul on Fire. Vis. Hold Madam! have you consider'd what you say? âIs this the vow'd Revengeâto make His Daughter a Sultana Queen? Shek. Short Sighted Politician!â Had he design'd her for our Lord, why was she Thus close conceal'd? Besides; I know The Mufti hates our Licentious Emperour; his late Attempt upon the Relict of Morat; His despising all his Queens when once enjoy'd; Three Sons already to bless the Imperial Line, And make succession sure. Therefore Shou'd her Womb prove fertil; the Royal Innocents Are only Born for Sacrificeâthese Reasons Weigh'd as soon he'd give his Daughter To a Brothel, as the Sultans Arms. Vis. I yield.âLet it but provoke him, or his Friends To Murmur, and I'll strangle Rebellion in their Throats. Shek. Come with me, and attend the Sultan; As we go, I'll instruct you, how This Contrivance reaches the Aga, and his Son, Breaking all their Measures. Vis. I wait upon you. [Exeunt. [The Sultan upon a Couch, Achmet by him. Ibra. From troubl'd Dreams my tortur'd Fancy Starts: Sleep, meant nature's refreshing Friend, sits heavy On my Soul, as Death her most inveterate Foe. Achmet! my faithful Boy! art thou there! [Sees Achmet. Achm. Dread Sir the Musick waits without! Prepar'd by the Italian MastersâTheir Melody May Chase these Melancholy Fumes away. Ibr. Admit 'em. A SONG. Imperial Sultan, Hail, To whom Great Kingdoms bow, Whose Vast Dominion shall prevail O'er all below, Commanding Woman here An Humble Vassal shall appear, No thunder in her Voice we prize, Or Lightning in her Eyes, When our Terrestrial God draws near. Under our Prophets Influ'nce Live, While wondring Nations view The deeds your Conquering Armies do And Christians to be made your subjects strive. A Dialogue Song. Suppos'd to be between an Eunuch Boy and a Virgin. Made for Boyn and Mrs. Crosse. Written by Mr. D' URFEY. She Fly from my Sight, fly far away; My Scorn thou'lt only purchase by thy Stay, Away, Fond Fool, away. He Dear Angel no,âno no no no, Here on this Place I'll rooted grow. Those Pretty Eyes have Charm'd me so: I cannot Stir, I cannot go. She Thou Silly Creature, be advis'd And do not stay to be despis'd, By all my Actions thou may'st see My Heart can spare no room for thee. He Why do'st thou hate me, Ah confess: Thou sweet disposer of my Joys? She The Reason is, I only guess, By something in thy Face and Voice, That thou art not made like other Boys. He Why, I can Kiss, and I can Play, And tell a Thousand Pretty Tales: And I can Sing the livelong Day; If any other Talent fails. She Boast not thy Musick, for I fear That Singing Gift has cost thee dear, Each warbling Linnet on the Tree Has far a Better Fate than thee, For they Lifes happy pleasures prove, As they can Sing, so they can Love. Chorus of Both. He Why so can I: She No no, poor Boy. He And tast Love's Joy. She No no, poor Boy. He Why cannot I? She Pish pishâOh Fye! He Pray do but try? She No no, not I. He I know, I know, no reason why? She You know, you know, you know You lye. Enter Visier and Shekar Para. Shekar kneeling. âHealth to the Ruler of the World; Success attend his Armies: whilst His own happy Hours, with surprizing Joys Are ever Crown'd; and long Life proves A Seraphick Cordial, without Alloy or Dregs. Visier. May all the mighty Ibrahims, and Our Prophet's Foes fall beneath his Feet; And every Slave bear a Heartâ Obedient, and Fond as mine Sult. As Heaven hath given me a Despotick And unbounded Power: so shall my Pleasures be. But oh! the Earth's too little; and its Pleasures Too few! I cannot keep my mind In a continued Frame of Joy; tho' the Slaves That serve me, vie with the Stars for number! Nay, tho' you, my Charming Mistress, Whose very conceptions, like your Wit, Divine, And like your Beauty pleasing: tho' you, I say, Set your Invention on the Wrack, for my Diversion; Yet still, to day's like yesterday: to morrow like to day. And tho' my Paths lie all thro' Paradise: Yet being still the self-same Road, I grow uneasie. Shek. Alas! Dread Sir! we've been mistaken; In vain we've search'd Persia, and Armenia, and Ransack'd Greece in vain; Whilst within your own Royal Gates Of this Seraglio lives a Helene, whose Lovely Face strikes Envy dumb. Late I saw her at the Baths; But, Heavens, such a Creature My astonish'd Eyes ne're view'd before. A Skin clear as the upper Region, Where Thickening Clouds can never mount: And strow'd with Blushes, like the glorious space Of Summer's setting Suns. Her large Black Eyes shot Rays intermingl'd With becoming Pride, and taking Sweetness. The Sultan Rises hastily. Sult. âHere in our Pallaceâimpossible âOf what Name? what Quality?â Shek. Morena, only Daughter to the MuftiâBut For what cause conceal'd I am ignorant. Vis. Had I Daughter, or Wife, whose Attractions Cou'd draw the Sultan's Eyes; how quickly shou'd she be offer'd! Sult. By Heaven! I'll see her, see her this very moment; And if she answers your Description, She's mine; first with Prayers, and Mildness We'll proceed; but, if the surly Fool denies; He soon shall find that Prayers are Needless, when Power is Infinite. Vis. I humbly beg to be excus'd, because The Mufti bears me mortal hate. Sult. Come thou, my Shekar, Para, Thy Eloquence may be useful, Tho' few perswasions sure will Prevail, to make a Woman Reign. Exeunt Attended The Scene changes to the Mufti's Apartment: He sits Reading. A Servant Enters hastily. Serv. Oh! SirâI saw the Sultan pass the Long Gallery That parts the Old Seraglio from the New; And bend his steps directly hitherâHe's 'een at my Heels! Muft. What can this visit mean? But I am arm'd with Innocence And therefore know no fear. Enter Ibrahim, Sheker Para Achmet, and several Attendants. Muft. Sacred Sir! I am amazedâ At these unwonted Honours; and if I fail In the expressions of my Joy; let my Confusion plead my excuse. Ibr. 'Tis all well, and the visit meant in kindness: I think when last I saw you, You asked for Amurat's appearance at our Portâ Selim go thou to the Imperial Camp And tell the Youth he shall be Welcome There as soon as he pleases. Muft. Let me kiss your Sacred Robe, In thankfulness.âOh! mighty Sultan, Who daigns thus to oblige his Vassals. Ibr. MuftiâI hear thou hast a Daughterâ Why dost thou start, Old Man?â If Fame may be believed thou need'st not shame To own the Beautious Maidâ Send for her hither, for I will see her. Muft. Oh! Pardon me Emperour, the Girl is most unfit For you to see, Bred up in Cells, and Grotto's: Tho' so near a Court, wholly unacquainted with its Glories. Heaven not Blessing me with a Male, I have try'd To mend the Sex; and she, instead of (coining looks) And learning little Arts to please, hath Read Philosophy, History, those rough Studies: And will appear like a neglected Villager To those bright Beauties that attend the happy Port. Ibr. Ha! Is this our entertainmentâto be deny'd What we desire! go some of you and fetch the Maid. Exeunt two Eunuchs. Muft. Tho' you are Lord of all, and may without controul Command, yet Emperor, Remember, My Daughter is no Slave, and our holy Law Forbids that you should force the free, Therefore if the unhappy Girl shou'd please, And then refuse the offered Greatness; our Prophets Curse Falls heavy, if you proceed to Violation. Enter Morena Veil'd. Muft. Kneel Daughter, to the Commander of the World. Ibr. Take off her Veilâby Heavensâ A charming Creature! Raise thee from the Earth, and lift thy eyes to Glory, A Crown will well become that Brow; Destiny Hath mark'd thee for CommandâI see Prevailing modesty is in her eyes; The shining springs are full of tearsâ I'll urge no farther now; but leave my Shekar Para, to prepare for the Excelling honours I design her; Mufti, come you with me, and let us Farther consult of this Important business. Exeunt the Sultan Mufti and Eunuchs: except Achmet. Shek. Hail! Happy Maid! whom Fate has blest; Whose Illustrious Eyes have caught The Monarch of the Earth, Ibrahim! Companion to the Sun, and Brother to the Stars! His Sacred presence strikes an universal aw; And next to the Immortals he is worshipt here. What a long Train of glory is opening to your view, Mounting on shining Thrones your beauties Merit! Whilst thousand ready slaves stand watching The Motions of your eyes, and e're you form Your breath into command, 'tis done. Mor. Cease Madam, you use your Eloquence in vain, Menaces, Prayers, and Promises are lost on me. Already I have Slaves, who wait on my desires, And fulfil whatever I command: more is but superfluous; No Crown I covet, but that which honour gives; And my Ambition terminates in the contented paths Of virtue. All your Efforts to alter me, Like waves against a Rock, will dash themselves, But stir not my Foundation. Shek. Why do ye view me with that haughty Regardless Air, as if I were your Enemy? When I so long to be your Friend. Mor. Oh! mistake me not,âIf my looks Carry a disdain, 'tis on the Crowns you offer; Not on you, Alas! you only can be my Friend; And divert the Emperour from the pursuit Of this short-liv'd passion; you do not know The secret pleasing cause that will, I am sure, Inspire me rather to dye than yield. Shek (aside) Too well I know it! âIf I cou'd assist, tho' your desires are strange, Yet, you have something so ingaging, If I cou'd, I say, I wou'd. Mor. Oh! 'tis greatly in your powerâ Tell the Sultan you have discovered, As you easily may a thousand Imperfections That I am sickly, peevish, ill Bred, and Of a hateful disposition.â Shek. I cannot so deny your Excellencies; But I will do my best, that you shall hear of this no more. Mor. And now, fair Oratrix, Who plead'st too well for such a cause; Apply thy Rhetorick to Ibrahim; And defend Morena's Life and Honour. Shek. Rest secur'd, I am wholly yours, Retire fair Innocence, for I see This surprize has discomposed ye. The Lively Red forsakes the charming Circle Of your cheeks, and fainting paleness takes its place: Retire, and let this Rancontre never trouble your repose. Exit. Morena. Poor easy Fool! blush Amurat At thy ill choice!âtake me For her Friend! yes to her destruction I'll prove a constant one. Achmet!â Ach. Madam. Shek. I go to seek the Sultan, chuse some Of the Eunuchs you command, and fetch Morena to him, if you meet resistance, Bring her by force: I saw Ibrahim Fasten his Eyes upon her, and I know The present will be welcome, now if delay The roving desires of that unstedfast Prince May fix elsewhere, and my designs be lost; Make haste, her Father is not yet returned, And you may do it with much ease Ach. It shall be done e're you have time to think the consequence. Exit. Shek. Revenge! how quick and lively are thy Joys? Love is a sweetness, that but tasted cloys; Love must be fondled with a gentle hand Revenge is God like all, and shows command. Exit. The Sultan Enters; the Visier following him. Sult. VVou'dst thou believe it Azemaâ This crabbed Priest do's in effect Deny his Daughter; curses he denounces If I compel her will, and seems To know she'll prove unwilling. Vis. In this his disloyalty too plain appears What other Grandee o'th' happy Port But with open arms wou'd embrace the honour And lay his Daughter prostrate at your Royal feet. Sult. True, therefore we'll on and fathom His Designs, the Maidens Beauty Has inflam'd meâwho dares oppose When I resolve Enjoyment? Enter Shek. Par. What News, my Sheker, hast thou brought her? Shek. O no! with Roman Courage, and most Unequall'd Resolution she repuls'd Whatever I cou'd offer, nor wou'd a Diadem, Or the Crown Imperial tempt her. Sult. How comes the lovely Maid to bear a Heart Thus stubborn! and look so sweetly mild? Vis. 'Tis her Father who has transferr'd His own traiterous Principles to her, Taught her early Disobedience (That I live to speak it!) Taught her to abhor your Royal Person. Shek. But your Majesty now may mould her as you please, Within a moment she'll be here; I took the opportunity of her Fathers absence, And order'd Achmet, with his Fellows, to bring Her hither. Sult. You have done well, Shall my almighty Will Which half the Universe obeys, Without dispute be contradicted By a Woman? Shek. I hear 'em coming. Achmet brings Morena, who speaks entring. Mor. Whither? Ah! Whither? Do ye drag me, Audacious Slaves Am I to be thus used? Vis. Madam, silence and awe best becomes This place which the dread Majesty of all the World contains, Nay our Law's so strict That an outragious Noise near the Sacred presence Is punish'd with immediate Death. Mor. Death I despise as I do thee, Who art not worth my answering. But to mine and my Countreys Lord I cast me with an obedient heart: Daign Mighty Sultan to hear with Mercy What your weeping Slave can say! Far be it from your humble Handmaid To refuse the vast Honour of your offer'd Love Thro' prideâOh! no! Holy binding vows are past already And horrid imprecations, which if I break, Distraction, despair, eternal ruine Straight will seize meâI know Your royal heart is full of soft humanity And God like Justice; you cannot take Anothers rightâa thousand willing beauties VVill with Joy, Embrace those favours I must ever flyâ Ibr. If thou hast vow'd, I cancel it, My Subjects are my slaves, who er'e Pretends a right to what I desire Is a Traytor, and shall so be punished If thus perverse you must be forced To your own happinessâ âAchmetâ Mor. O spare me Emperor! spare me! And all my future life I'll spend In prayers for Ibrahim! Each morning as I bless the rising day I'll cry aloud, this id'e seen no more, Had not my God like Master heard: I'll never eat, nor sleep, nor Ought of life enjoy, before I have pray'd for And after praised our Lord! Ibr. Achmetâbear her to the royal bed. Mor. Hold! yet a momentâhold! I have one thing more to say As I have often heard my wretched Father tell âWhen fierce Morat, your Predecessor Doom'd his brothers, even all the young Princes Of the Imperial race, to suddain death, They dyed: my Father begged for you: Begged till he prevail'd: Oh! if this merit ought Punish my disobedience with Wracks with Gibbets, With any thing but loss of honour! Tear out my eyes, stab, mangle my face; Till it grow horrible to Nature And the amazed world gaze with terror, Not delight: burn me! heap torture Upon torture! and if I murmur a complaint Fulfil the bitterst curseâRelease, And bear me to your bed!

Then thus I quit it. Draws it thro' her hands. See Emperor, see, are these hands Fit to clasp thee? judge by this, My resolutionâdeath hath a Thousand doors; Sure Morena, curst Morena May find out oneâ Ibr. Slaves, why dally ye thus? By Heaven rage is mixt with love, And I am all on fire! Drag her to yond Apartments! Mor. Do Tyrant! but 'tis thy last of mischiefs If thou dost not kill meâ With dishevell'd hair, torn Robes, and These bloody hands, I'll run thro' all thy Guards And Camp, whilst my just complaints, compel rebellion! Vis. Yet here! force her way! Mor. I will not stir, fixt upon Earth, I'll rend obdurate Heaven with piercing Crys; till I have forced their mercy! Help! help! open thou Earth to hide me! Have my woes not weight enough to sink me To the Center?âat length 'tis come; My spirits are decay'd, Oh Amurat! Where art thou? and where (alas) am I? Swoons. Vis. She faints, convey her quickly in, Your Majesty Will soon revive her. Ibr. Threatning Danger shall never bar my way, I'll rush thro' all, and seize the trembling prey: Rifle her sweets, till sense is fully cloy'd; Then take my turn to scorn what I've enjoy'd. Exit.</field>

Am. I goâSolyman, fly to the Camp, And bring from thence my select Troops, I'll take care at Night to give you safe admittance; Oh World! uncertain always, false, and vain, Thro' mighty Toils our wishes we obtain. And hard we struggle for the expected gain: But when in view o'th' end of all our care, Some awkard Fate hurls back to deep Despair Thus to th'Abyss, in sight of Heaven, I fall, And lose my Love, my Honour, Life and all.

I tell thee, Visier, and mark it well, Watch the first rising of Rebellion, For should it grow too high; thou art The fittest Sacrifice to attone the Popular Fury. Vis.

Now every petty Priest struts, Looks big; tells a long tale Of grievances, Models Governments, and Censures Kingsâlet your Ring leader know, that I despise His Trayterous Summons, and Trample it beneath my feetâ Yet, Holdâthou art not fit To bear a Message back from Ibrahim, who darest to bring him Such a one; take hence the Villain, And strangle him immediately. Mess. Oh! Mercy! Mercy! Ibr. Away with him!â Visier, Double our Guards, and From the Army draw all, whose Loyalty You think untaintedâbe Vigilantâ For on thy Life depends thy careâ Weep not, my Sheker Paraâ We yet shall brave this Stormâ By Heaven!â I to the Last my glory will maintain, Or, absolute I'll be, or, cease to Reign!
