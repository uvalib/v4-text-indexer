      <field name="fulltext">THE Countess of Salisbury. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO ELIZABETH, Countess of Moira.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY Mr. WESTON, in the Character of a TEAGUE. My jewels, I'm come to spake in the behalfâ Hoot, Devil burn you all, you makes me laugh, Upon my soul now I don't take it well in you: Arra, be easy, till I'm after telling you: Smit with the love of glory and of pelf, To night, a bard from Dublin its ownself, Has brought a play here for your approbation, A very pretty thing by my salvationâ If you'll trust Irish evidence I meanâ I can't the story very well explain; But it's about a Countess and an Earl, The Countess is a mighty honest girl; But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name, Makes such proposhalsâ'tis a burning shameâ Another tooâa Knightâbekeys as whyâ But hould you know, you'll see it by and by, And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot. O, but that's true, I'd like to have forgot, The dressesâ'Pon my conscience in my days I never saw their peer, they're all a blaze. Then there's a child, the sweetest little rogueâ Only excuse a trifling spice of a brogueâ He'll make you cry your eyes out, I'll be boundâ 'Tis Ireland is the true poetic ground. The MusesâPhÅbus, heath'nish cant I loath! What's Mount Parnassus to the Hill of Howth? Or all the scenes each foolish poet paintsâ O bub bub-boo! give me the Isle of Saints. Turn up your noses, cavil now and carpâ Musha, I'm sure our emblem is the harp. But stop, the bell rings. Fait they'll soon begin; 'Tis time for me to be a going in. I take my lave thenâbut dear craters mindâ Pray to our Irish poetry be kind: 'Tis a new manufacture in effectâ And yours, my sowls t'encourage and protect; No critic custom then exacted be, Pass it like Irish linen, duty free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. DANCER. This virgin author's such a blushing rogueâ What! no gay, lively, laughing epilogue! âMadam (says he, and look'd so wise) in Greeceââ (Greece; that's their cant) âno jesting clos'd the piece. âPlay, epilogue and all were grave and solemnââ Then, Sir, the town were fools that did not mawl 'em. Noâlet your heroine, in this laughing age, Come thus (as Bayes says) souse upon the stage; Then with a jaunty air, half smile, half grin, Curtsey quite round the boxes, and begin. A spark from court, and no one to detect him! A pretty fellow too, and yet reject him!â Now, Ladies, let me die but it was sillyâ You'll not approve such horrid pruderyâwill ye?â I shou'd have bless'd the occasion, and receiv'd him! He shou'd have kneel'd and vow'd, and Iâbeliev'd him; Laugh'd, danc'd and sported it till spouse came over, Then kiss'd my dearâwhile Betty hid my lover. But here again our Poet checks my flight, âNay, Madam, you mistake the matter quite. âMy heroine liv'd in ancient, honest times; âCards were unknown, and gallantries were crimesââ 'Psha! what if females then were seldom rovers? Husbandsâ(aye, there's the cause) were warm as lovers. Their warlike days indeed were spent in killing; But then, at nightâno turtles were so billing. Wellâtho' he gives me no smart things to say, I wish this begging face may save his play: The thing may mend, and learn to please you betterâ Do thenânay, pray you shew him some good nature.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An Avenue leading to a Gothic Castle. Enter Grey, and First Knight. Grey. A messenger dispatch'd by lady Salisbury! Knight. And in the specious guise he wore, had pass'd Unquestion'd, had not I, in happy season, Approach'd, even as th'unwary centinels Half op'd the gate. By threats o'eraw'd in part, In part thro' hope of favour won, he own'd, At length, by whom employed, whither bent, And for what purpose. Grey. Sayâ Knight. Strait to repair To Marlborough; where now, as fame reports, Our king resides, with all his peers; and there To seek the lord de Warren; to what end This paper will, as I suppose, inform youâ I was about to bear it to lord Raymond. Grey. That care be mine. Henceforward it concerns Us near, our vigilance be doubly firm. [Exit Knight. Grey reads. The countess of Salisbury, to her illustrious Friend, the lord de Warren. âI have lost my husbandâMe and my lands âlord Raymond claims, as by royal grant assigned âto him. He has banished my train, encompassed âme with his creatures, and holds me a âprisoner in my own castle. If the memory of âthy noble friend be dear to thee, haste and ârescue the afflicted ELA.â How near was Raymond's hope, the beauteous hope He tended with unceasing care, how near My rising fortunes marr'dâI like not this: Her, and her rich domains he wou'd possess; Yet in his breast there lives that kind of heart Withholds him from the path that's nearestâHe, That wou'd be great, must first be bold. I hate those motley'd characters; Something, I know not what, 'twixt good and ill, Yet neither absolute: all good, all ill For meâThat day, saith he, that happy day, Which sees the countess mine, shall amply pay Thy services: a doubtful balance this Whereon my fortunes hangâThis way he moves; And, by his gait and gesture, ill at easeâ We must be firm; My hopes demand it, and the time admits No weak, no scrupulous delayâ Enter Raymond. Raymond. To sue, But ever without grace to sueâoh Grey! I am even weary of the vain pursuit. Grey. It is, in truth, my lord, an irksome labour. Raymond. But now I cast me at the fair one's feet; Pleaded my passion with whatever arts Might best the gentle purpose aid; but she, Instead of such return as I might hope, Repaid me with an eye of cold contempt. Of her late gallant lord she spoke; his merits In opposition hateful plac'd to mine. Urg'd, then, with recollection of her wrongs, Like the loud torrent, with steep winter rains O'ercharg'd, in all the loose, ungovern'd sway Of wrath and indignation, she assail'd me. Grey. And did my lord, in this unseemly fashion, Hear all with equal temper? Wak'd he not With such a peal? Raymond. Thou know'st not what it is To love like meâLong time (for passion now Had shed o'er all her charms a brighter glow, That like Jove's daughter most she look'd, severe In youthful beauty) long I lay, o'eraw'd And silenc'd as by some superior being; Till wak'd by pride, quick from the floor I sprung; Warn'd her how she provok'd my power; 'Twas great, 'twas now within these walls supreme: I long had gently woo'd her, but that love, Tho' patient, would not always brook disdain. Grey. 'Twas well: and what ensu'd? Raymond. Silence at first, Then tears; bright drops, like May-morn dews that fall From the sweet blossom'd thorn. Back in her chair She sunkâOh! had you seen her then, dissolv'd In all the soft, the lovely languishment Of woe; while at her knee, with countenance Most piteous stood her beauteous boy, and look'd As if each tear, which from his mother fell, Wou'd force a passage to his little heartâ I fled; else had I kneel'd, and wept myself As well as she. Grey. O shame to manhood!âsuits Such weakness with our hopes? Raymond. She must, she must, Yes, Grey, she must be mineâand yetâyet fain Wou'd I persuade the fair one, not compel. Grey. Say to what purpose then was seizd her castle? When she your suit rejected, then perforce To claim her as the gift of royal favour! To lord it here so long, and now to falterâ My lord, my lord, the mound is overleapt, What now forbids but without further pause To crop the rich, the golden fruits within? Raymond. Ungracious is the love reluctance yields; And cold, cold even as marble is the maid, Who comes unwilling to another's arms. Grey. In brief, would you partake the lady's bed? Raymond. What means the question? Grey. Look on that, my lord: Better reluctant come, than not at all. Raymond. âHow came this to your hand? Grey. By one whose cares Of thee demand no trivial recompence. His wakeful eye it was descry'd the bearer; Else had the watch with all their vigilance Prov'd insufficient. Raymond. My better angel interpos'd. Grey. Had this it's purpos'd scope attain'dâmy lord, Were this but whisper'd in our Henry's earâ He gave the royal nod you say: true, he Permitted, but thus far; that you should woo The lady, and her choice approving, wed; No more. By us the public ear is told She hath approv'd: our artifice hath spread The rumour; and with some it is receiv'd That she is now your full-espoused consort: But truth, my lord, long cannot rest conceal'd; It will abroad, of that be sure, in spite Of all our studied wiles. Raymond. What's to be done? Grey. 'Tis critical; and must be manag'd nicelyâ But see, with Eleanor the countess comes; And in her hand the young lord William. Here Her custom is to walk: retire we now; And thou observe the counsels of a friend. [Exeunt ambo.] Enter Lady Salisbury, Lord William, Eleanor. Lady Salisbury. Talk'st thou of patience? What! the very roof, That shou'd protect and shelter me, become My prison! Aw'd, and threatened, as I am, By this intruder!âCruel destiny! Had I not more than common griefs before? Eleanor. In evil hour thy hospitable gates Were open'd to receive him. Lady Salisbury. Unguarded that I was!âBut who could then Foresee the purpose of his coming? Eleanor. Who Can think even yet, that once repuls'd, he e'er Wou'd thus presume? Lady Salisbury. Is there no succour then? No generous hand to vindicate my wrongs?â Oh Salisbury! Salisbury! why, if yet thou liv'stâ Fond hope! he lives not, else with speed of thought Would he repair to his afflicted Ela. Eleanor. Why, dearest lady, will you yield you up A prey to purpos'd sorrow? Time is fruitful; And the next hour perhaps may bring thee comfort. Lady Salisbury. Day after day I have watch'd the joyless hours; Night after night, when some fleet courier sent Before perchance, or letter fraught with sweet Assurance of his safety might appear; Five tedious moons have pass'd since first were told The dismal tidings; no fleet courier sent Before, alas! nor letter with such sweet Assurance yet appearsâHe's gone, he's lost! And I shall never, never see him more. Eleanor. Ah! suffer not the leaden hand of cold Despair thus weigh thee down; I yet have hopeâ Lady Salisbury. Away with hope, away. No, no; full loud, As I remember, and outrageous blew The storm, that even the solid fabric shook Of yonder walls; deep-rooted oaks gave way; Churches and spires were overturn'd; nor even The peasant's humble roof escap'd that hour. The fleet, save only one, one luckless ship, Have all return'd; my lord nor hath been seen, Alas! nor ever heard of since the storm. Eleanor. Heaven visit her affliction, and bestow That patience which she needs. Lady Salisbury. No, Eleanor: no more shall he To these deserted walls return. No more Shall trophies, won by many a gallant deed, Thro' the long hall in proud procession move; No more fair Salisbury's battlements and towers Re-echo to th'approaching trumpet's voice. Never, oh! never more shall Ela run With throbbing bosom at the well-known sound, T'unlock his helmet, conquest plum'd, to strip The cuishes from his manly thigh, or snatch Quick from his breast the plated armour, wont T'oppose my fond embraceâSweet times farewel, These tender offices are now no more. Lord William. Mother, why do you speak so? You make me sad. Lady Salisbury. It is too soon, my child, for thee to know What sadness is. Lord William. Will not my father come home soon? Eleanor told me he wou'd: she wou'd not tell a lye. Lady Salisbury. No, love. Lord William. Then he will come. Lady Salisbury. Sweet innocence! I fear he will not. Lord William. I hope he is not sick. Lady Salisbury. âGo, lovely pratler, seek thy toys; go, go. Lord William. I will, good mother; but don't be sad, or I shall be so too. [Exit. Lady Salisbury. Sweet state of childhood! unallay'd with cares; Serene as spring-tide morn, new welcom'd up With bleat of lamb, with note of woodlark wild. With riper years come passions turbulent And rude, a baleful crew, unnumber'd as The forest leaves that strew the earth in autumn. When happiness is round thee, when thou art on The lap of downy ease, when thou art cherish'd In the fair bosom of unruffl'd joy, Comes a fell hand, dashes thee rudely down, And leaves thee to despair. Eleanor. Cease, Cease, lady, to afflict thee: Raymond may, I trust he will, e'er long retire, and give Thee ease againâBut hither comes his minion: Much with his lord he can; and, as he lists, To purposes of good or ill o'er-rules His mind: if he accost thee, speak him gently. Enter Grey. As you are fair above all other women, So may you lend to that I would implore A gracious ear. Lady Salisbury. Without more preface, briefly speak thy suit. Grey. To love, but ne'er to reap of love the sweet Returns, is sure the worst of ills, Lady Salisbury. And what of that? Grey. Tho' love denied, yet pity may do much To soothe the wound that beauty givesâIn brief, Thou much-rever'd! my suit is in behalf of Raymond. Lady Salisbury. Then I will spare us both some cost Of wordsâIn brief, I love him not, nor pity: So tell thy lordâI would be privateâhence. Grey. Your words are brief indeed; but of that kind I dare not, must not bear my lord. Lady Salisbury. Must not! Grey. 'Tis cruel toward the man who loves so fondly. Lady Salisbury. Doth he assume the specious name of love? Love is a bright, a generous quality, Heaven gave to noble minds; pure, and unmix'd With every grosser stuff; a goodly flower, Shoots up and blossoms in great souls alone. Grey. The mind, th'exalted soul thou nam'st, is his. Lives there a youth more gentle of condition, In fair accomplishments more grac'd, admir'd? If beauty sway thy fond regards, if wealth, I know not in fair England one with him Can vie. Lady Salisbury. Is then the star, the peerless star, That late was gaz'd on, quite obscur'd? What tho' He may have set, hath he not left a train Of glory in the skies?âTh'illustrious name Of Salisbury yet survivesâIf wealthâbut mark me; Were he of all the wealth possess'd from where Th'East Indian bids the sun good-morrow, to where Th'Atlantic in her wide-extended lap Receives him setting; cou'd he in each hand A thousand sceptres place, not all shou'd bribe Me to his bedâNo, Salisbury! thou hast been The husband of my early love; with thee, That love was all interr'd; and when I pluck It forth again, gape wide that earth wherein Thou liest, quick snatch me from the light of Heaven, And swallow me within her lowest prison! Grey. For pity's sake yet soften; for, oh sure No former love could ever equal this; No bosom boast the generous flame wherewith Lord Raymond glows for thee, admired fair! Lady Salisbury. Hear this, ye Heavens, and grant me patience,âwhere's My people? where the freedom that I late Was blest with? Wherefore is my palace throng'd With strangers? Why, why are my gates shut up And fortified against their rightful mistress? Grey. Madamâ Lady Salisbury. Is this the love he boasts? Is this the fair-accomplish'd, this the gentle youth? Must I recall to mindâCame he not then Even while the memory of my dear lov'd lord Was green; while sorrow yet was in mine eyes? âTears! ye will choak meâCame he not even then, And broke in on my sorrows? Like a spoiler He came, heap'd up the measure of my woes, Added new anguish to th'afflicted heart, And swell'd the current of the widow's tears. Grey. Madam, where he that spoiler thou proclaim'st, He need not now thus humbly sue for that His power long since, unask'd might have extorted. Lady Salisbury. Ha!âwhat art thou that thus presum'st to threaten? Extorted!âHence thou rude one, bolder even Than him who calls thee slave. Grey. Madam you speak As though you knew me not. Lady Salisbury. I know thee wellâ To what concerns lord Raymond I have spoke, My final purpose fix'd: For thee, I charge thee shun my presence; hence, And learn the distance that befits thy calling. Grey. Not ere I speak more fully to the causeâ Nay, lady, look not on me with so stern An eye, but give me patient hearingâ Lady Salisbury. No more; I'll hear no more. Grey. Not hear!âWhen next we meetâI will be heard. [Exit.] Lady Salisbury. What meant he, Eleanor?âI will be heard. Eleanor. Alas! I know not: but a soul he hath, Prompt and alert to acts of desperate thinking. Hardly thou art beset; O lady, lend An ear to what thy Eleanor would counsel. When next he come (for that he hath obtain'd Of Raymond leave to woo thee to his will, I know) assume a gentler carriage. Seem As tho' you may hereafter to his suit Incline. Be rul'd: necessity oft lends A sanction to deceit. Demand a pause: My lord of Salisbury's fate yet unconfirm'd Shall add thereto a seeming colour. Chance, Mean time, that comes or soon or late to all, To thee may come with unexpected succour. Lady Salisbury. âSincerity, Thou spotless as the snowy-vested hill, Forgive me, if by lawless power constrain'd, I turn this once from thy long-trodden path; It must be soâ Oh Salisbury! Salisbury! thou lamented shade! Descend from those pure mansions, where thou sitst Exalted; hover o'er me; and as thou Wert wont, support me in this hour of trial.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE within the Castle. Enter Raymond and Grey. Grey. Away, my lord, away with every care; The conflict's past, and fortune is our ownâ Defeated once, again I sought the fair; I sought her, and prevail'd. Raymond. By all the joys, the nameless joys, that on The precious hour of soft compliance wait, I will requite thee nobly. Say, for much My wonder's mov'd, how hast thou found Such grace? how wrought this change, thus sudden thus, Unhop'd from her late bearing? Grey. Uncertain is the sexâbut that imports not. It now remains, that proof, such proof be sought Of Salisbury's fate, as by minute detail Of circumstance shall with the lady gain Prompt credenceâHear what I have devis'd, if you Approveâ Enter a Knight. Knight. My lord, two strangers I have brought, Within the precincts of the castle found. Raymond. Say'st thou? two strangers? of what quality? Knight. With me they were of speech not over-prompt; But by their outward guise they wou'd seem men As with some pious purpose charg'd. Severe The younger seems, but of excelling form; And wishes to recruit his wearied limbs Beneath the friendly covert of this roof. Raymond. Conduct them to our presenceâ[Exit Knight.] I were loth, The weary traveller to dismiss my gates, Unhospitably rude; yet none I wish, While we are yet suspended at the nod Of peevish and uncertain chance, approach These walls. Re-enter Knight, with Strangers. Whence, and what are you? First Stranger. What we are, These weeds, tho' we were silent, might unfold. Alwin I am call'd, my fellow-traveller Leroches. Our way was bent for Canterbury, With purpose of a pious vow: o'erta'en By weariness from travel, and desire Of food, we journey'd hitherward, in hope The lord of these fair turrets, first descry'd At close of evening, might befriend our toils. Raymond. Whence have you come? Alwin. From France, not many days. Raymond. Say, what occasion may have call'd you thither? Alwin. To aid (Heav'n prosper long) my country's weal. Raymond. You are a soldier then? Alwin. I have been such; And to be such was my most dear inclining; Smit with the love, even from my greenest youth, Of honest arms. Some share of fame I too Atchiev'dâBut ill the soldier it beseems To trumpet his own praises. Raymond. Cease not so. Tho' in the school of war untutour'd, much It pleaseth me to hear the brave man's labours. Alwin. None but have heard how some time since was sent (To claim of Lewis certain lands usurp'd) A puissant forceâ Raymond. Were you therein employed? Alwin. Beneath the royal banner I enroll'd, As was my bent, in quest of fame. Raymond. Indeed! Lord Salisbury then perchance of thee was known? Alwin. I knew him well; our liege's near ally, And second to duke Richard in command. Fast by his side was my allotted post Upon the marshal'd field: by him I fought, For him had died. Raymond. Of him fame loudly speaks, That in those wars he was a gallant man. Alwin. He was not wont, while others bravely fought, To look unactive on. Leroches. A foe like him France never knew, of all that warriour host, Which like an inundation England pour'd On her affrighted shoresâ Raymond. But what Have prov'd his latter fortunes I shou'd wish To learnâSay, courteous stranger, if thou canst. Of this renowned lord a rumour hath Long since prevail'd, that he on Gallia's coast Was wreck'd with all his crew. Alwin. What cause there was For such report, alas! these eyes have seen; How true in part it is, too sure this tongue Can testify. Raymond. I pray you let us hear. Alwin. âO'ercharg'd with human prey, fell war had ceas'd To walk his wasteful round; well pleas'd we turn Us from the blood-stain'd field; exulting each With some rich spoil, trophies by valiant dint Of arms atchiev'd. Forthwith the eager host Embark. And now the chalky cliffs on Albion's coast T'our straining view appear'd; th'exulting crew With peals redoubled greet the well known shoresâ Ill-fated men!âin vain the anxious dame Oft mounts the high-rais'd tower, thence earnest looks Haply if her wish'd for lord may come; in vain The prattling boy oft asks her of his sire, That never, never shall return. Raymond. Proceed, Good stranger; what was the event? Alwin. Anon The winds began to shift; up rose a storm And heav'd the bosom of the troubled deep. On the swoln billow sits enthron'd grim Death, And shakes his fatal dartâThe fleet, which late In such fair order sail'd, is now dispers'd. Before the wind we drove, left to the mercy Of the wild waves, and all-disposing Heavenâ Oh my lov'd friends! associates of my toils! Rescu'd in vain from War's wide-wasteful arm, Here end your labours; here sweet life forsakes you. For me, a slender plank, next to the hand Of some good angel, bore me to the shore. Of full five hundred gallant lives, which late Embark'd, not one that fatal hour surviv'd. Raymond. Save only thee. Alwin. Save only me. Raymond. Speak now secure, for nearly it concerns My quiet, speakâwas, Salisbury of your crew? Alwin. Alas! too sure. Raymond. EnoughâThy courtesy Of us may well, and shall be well requited. Of this our friend accept mean time his prompt Regards; anon we shall be glad to hold Some further converse with you. [Exit Alw. Lero. and Knight. Grey. Of this stranger What thinks my lord? Raymond. As of an angel, sent To waft me on his wings strait to the summit Of all my wishesâWith what a gallant grace He bears him!âMuch I wish to hear him speak Again; to hear the battles he has fought, And all the story of his life and fortunes. Grey. That we shall learn hereafter: but 'tis meet That he to lady Salisbury first unfold The sum of what he hath reported. Raymond. Methinks I now behold her, like some full-blown flower, The fairest of the garden, late o'ercharg'd With showers, her head declining sad, whilst he Recounts the story of her Salisbury's fate. Wou'd she were mine without a tear; Without a sigh!âBut she must weep; she must; Thereon my all dependsâOh wayward sorrow! That wounds, yet wounding heals the lover. [Ex. amb. Scene changesâLady Salisbury reclining on a couch. Enter Eleanor. Eleanor. Grief, that of time's fix'd periods for repose Takes small account, hath lull'd her wearied sensesâ Where'er thou dwell'st, O Peace, with azure eye Serene; or if in stately-structur'd dome, Or thatch-roof'd cottage low, or in cool grot By fountain clear thou sitt'st, or if perchance Along the silver brook's green liveried verge Reclin'd, approach thou rosy-dimpled fair; Leave thy sweet haunts a while; and with that balm Which sooths the woe-struck heart, await her slumbers. The hour approaches, when, as is her custom, She seeks the hallow'd shrine, and pious wakes The voice of pure devotion to high heaven: I'll thither, and expect herâbut she wakesâ How fares the mistress of my best regards? Proved her slumbers sweet as were my wishes? Lady Salisbury. Sweet, sweet, my Eleanor, so sweet, oh! wou'd I ne'er had wak'd. I dreamt, as wont on him To dream, that I beheld his gracious form, My bosom's lord; a while he stood, and seem'd On me to smile; then flew to my embraces.â Ah fleeting extacy! 'twas but a dream: Enter a Knight. Knight. Thy favour, lady; I am charg'd with news, That much imports thy hearing: summon up Thy powers; two strangers late have come, of whom One brings assured tidings of thy lord. Lady Salisbury. âMy lordâwhatâspeakâ Knight. He saith he knew my lord Of Salisbury well; that he was of his crew; And with that peer embark'd from France. Lady Salisbury. âButâwellâfrom Franceâ Knight. Lady, all must have Their sorrows. Strait up rose a mighty tempest, Dispers'd the fleet o'er all the seasâ The stormâthe fatal wreckâof all The stranger gives most circumstantial proof. [Exit.] Eleanor. Alas the tidings!âDearest lady, give Thy sorrows vent; thy bosom's overfraught, And will find ease by letting loose its woes. Lady Salisbury. âWell, wellâ Then he is lost, and all, all is despair. Tho' languid, yet was hope not quite extinctâ Where, where's the stranger? Seek him, haste; that I May hear him fully speak of all. [Ex. Knt.] Methinks 'Twill be a desperate sort of soothing; to hang Upon each sound, catch every circumstance Of the sad story, and wring my aching heart Till I am even surfeited with sorrow. Eleanor. Behold, the stranger comesâ Enter Alwin. Lady Salisbury. Bear, bear me up, good Heaven! That I may give full measure to my sorrow. Alwin. âThy angel hover o'er thee, and support thee. [In an under voice.] Lady Salisbury. âThe dead ere now Have burst the prisons of the close pent grave, And apparitions strange of faith appear'd; Perhaps thou too art but a shadow; let Me grasp thee, for, as I have life, I thinkâ It is, it is my Salisbury! O my lord! Lord Salisbury. My bosom's joy! Lady Salisbury. âAnd dost thou live indeed? Amazing Providence! He does! he does! Look! look! behold him, Eleanor! behold The gracious form! the vision was not vain. [Eleanor goes aside.] Lord Salisbury. âAnd art thou, art thou thenâ Lady Salisbury. âO my full bosom! Lord Salisbury. The same, by time or circumstance unchang'd? Lady Salisbury. Unhop'd reverse!âHence, hence all former woesâ My lord! my life! hence, hence, be swallow'd up All griefs, and lost in this most blissful hour. Lord Salisbury. Thou art, I see, thou art the same, thou must; Thou hast not yielded to another lord? Lady Salisbury. Another lord!âAnd cou'd you, did you think 'Twas so? Lord Salisbury. Thus spoke loud rumour on my way: Indeed I scarce cou'd think it. Lady Salisbury. Oh! 'twas foul! Indeed thou shoud'st not think itâ Lord Salisbury. Ever dear! No more; my soul is satisfied, and thinks Of nothing now but happiness and thee. Lady Salisbury. Say then, thou wandererâOh! I have much Of thee to ask, thou much to hear: how is't I see thee, see thee thus? Where hast thou been? What secret region hath so long datain'd thee? Lord Salisbury. O thou! whose image, ever in my view, Sustain'd me angel-like against the rough And rapid current of adversity, Shou'd I recount the story of my fortunes, Each circumstance, beginning from that day We parted, to this hour, thine ear wou'd be Fatigu'd; the stars, ere I had ended, cease To twinkle, and the morning's sun break in Upon th'unfinish'd tale; suffice it thee To know the summ. For England we embark'd, when, black and foul, A tempest rising, quick upturn'd the seas, And cast me forth upon an hostile shore. Why need I tell thee, love, how, in disguise, On foot, alone, I've toil'd my weary way, Thro' dreary vale, o'er mountain wild; my bed Oft of the blasted heath, whilst o'er my limbs Dank night hath shaken her cold, dewy wings, And the chill northern gale hath spent his breath On my defenceless head? Thro' what variety of strange events I've come, Heaven-guided, to behold, once more, My wife?âBut, ah! my son! our only hope! My boy! what, what of him? Lady Salisbury. Dear to these eyes As is the new-born light of Heaven! he lives; Is wellâBut say, my lord, what would thy coming, Thus unattended, thus disguised! Lord Salisbury. How I escap'd from hard captivity, And Gallia's coast, more leisure shall inform you. My friend sir Ardolf had but just embrac'd me, (The first glad transports of our meeting o'er) When, with an honest tear, the good old man In brief disclos'd what fame had now reported; That thou wert soon, or had'st, ere this, espous'd Earl Hubert's nephew, and sole purpos'd heirâ Lady Salisbury. Oh most unhallow'd, thus t'abuse My unattainted love!âAnd cou'd my lordâ Lord Salisbury. Yet hear meâStrait I grasp'd my sword; And, single as I was, had sallied forth, Had not my friend's sage counsels interpos'd. By Ardolf sway'd, I veil'd me as thou see'st; And, with a sharer in the dark intent, Set forward on my way for Sal'sbury castle: A simple hind's low cottage, not far hence, Receiv'd us. Here, fast by the green-wood side, We lodg'd; resolv'd, ourselves unknown, to prove What doubtful rumour only had proclaim'd. With this intent, at dusk of evening, we Forsook the cotâ Lady Salisbury. There needs no more: Heaven saw Me, and was touch'd with pityâWhat a change This hour! Sequester'd as I was, even like The votarist; perhaps the destin'd prey Of rude desireâ Lord Salisbury. O for to-morrow's slow-returning night! Lady Salisbury. Say, what of that, my lord? Lord Salisbury. Revenge, revenge! I'll tell theeâSoon as dark usurping night Shall chace to-morrow's sun adown the skies, Know, Ardolf, with a chosen troop of friends, To that same cottage, arm'd shall comeâ Enter Eleanor. Eleanor. My lord, I hear th'approach of hasty steps. Lord Salisbury. Farewel, my best: Nor peace nor sleep shall visit me, till I Have given thee freedom, and reveng'd our wrongs. Enter a Knight. Knight. Lord Raymond, sir, forthwith expects your coming. Lord Salisbury. I will attend him. Lady, fain wou'd I Have told thee less ungracious things; but all Have their appointed trials. Learn to bear; Convinc'd, the hand Heaven, when it inflicts, Prepares us oft for some superior good. [Exeunt omnes. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE within the Castle. Enter Raymond and Grey. Raymond. I see nor cause my joys to check, nor boast As yet securely. Grey. Think, that Hope, the young, The merry-minded fair, exalts us oft, To make our fall the greater. Raymond. Why this cold, This prudent maxim?â Grey. Mark the wary falcon; Forward he shoots his piercing eye, and kens The quarry from afar; like his be thineâ Perhaps, my lord, mine are but nicer fears, Wak'd in a heart o'er anxious of thy welfare; Yet hath the younger of those strangers rais'd In me suspicions of alarming hue, Lest, underneath this honest guise, there lurk Some subtle mischief. Lady Salisbury saw him: Their conference, as 'twas long, so was it held In secret; wou'd we had been present. Raymond. Granting Our presence had been seemly, wherefore spoke You not this counsel ere they met? Grey. I saw not then the danger. His honest carriage, and the recent change Within her mind had lull'd each nicer fear. Raymond. 'Till now unmov'd, say what hath wak'd suspicion? Grey. I know not wellâwou'd she were firmly thine, Beyond the reach and grasp of wayward fortune. The knight, whose office was to introduce Him to the countess, he dismiss'd ere they Approach'd th'apartment. Raymond. Indeed! Grey. This, tooâIs it not strange, tho' night, and this Thy proffer'd roof, invited his sojourn, He wou'd not wait th'approach of morning? Raymond. Are they gone? Grey. Amid th'unguarded joy Which held us, they escap'd unheeded. Enter Second Knight. Knight. My lord, Two strangers, it is said, in Palmer's weeds Attir'd, have lodg'd since morning in a hut; You may have mark'd it in the darksome glen, Near to the forest of wild oaks, just where The stream white rushes down the shelving cliff. Raymond. Since morning say'st thou? Knight. Further I have learn'd, Their guise, as doth appear from certain words O'erheard, is borrow'd with design to mask Some secret purpose. [Exit.] Grey. It must be so; Their close-concerted arts have foil'd our caution. Raymond. They scarce have measur'd half the precincts yet, Send forth my knights, we will pursue them. Grey. No: one way there is, and only oneâBut hence, I hear the countessâShe loves lord William well; And much, much will a pious mother sure, To save an only son. [Exeunt ambo.] Enter Lady Salisbury and Eleanor. Lady Salisbury. In spite of this event, this blest event, That hath restor'd the lord of this fond bosom, Yet is my mind with doubts and fears disturb'd; With images and wild conceits, of form Unsightly; such as hover oft in dreams About the curtains of the sickâAlas! Whilst others joy within the friendly roof, Of night regardless and the storm that beats Without, he struggles hard; or hies at best To the dank shelter of the dripping wood. Besides what unknown perils may assail him, Unnaided thus against whatever illâ Wou'd he had waited the return of morn. Eleanor. The night is dark indeed, the tempest high; But hear me, lady, hear a pious lesson, Which thy own lips to me have oft repeated: There is a Power unseen, whose charge it is, With ever wakeful eye to watch the good; And peaceful ever is that breast, which trusts In his angelic guardâThe hand Of Heaven, that hitherto hath been his shield, Will minister safe convoy to his steps, Tho' night and darkness shed their thickest gloom. Lady Salisbury. Misdeem not of my fears; or think I speak, As over diffident of that same power Thou nam'st, whose all surveying eye wakes ever; Clear, unobstructed, either when the sun Shrowds in night's shadowy veil, or when at noon He shines reveal'd on his meridian throne. But where's the bosom throbs not, if it hope? Hope ever is attended with a train Of wakeful doubts; and where the sweet nymph harbours, There flutters also her pale sister Fearâ But hence, as was our purpose, to the shrine; Where, as is meet, for my dear lord restor'd I will with grateful adorationâ Enter Lord William. Lord William. MotherâI fain would know that stranger, who he is that just now met me. Lady Salisbury. And wherefore would'st thou know him, love? Lord William. Gentle he was, and mild, not like those grimfac'd ones I see here every day: and such kind things he did, as make me love him dearly. Lady Salisbury. Say, what were they? Lord William. He kiss'd me, strok'd my head, and patted me upon the cheek, and saidâ Lady Salisbury. What said, he, sweet? Lord William. He saidâHeaven bless thy beauteous head, sweet boy! Enter Grey. Grey. Permit me, honour'd dame, I have a word Or two, that claims thine ear. Lady Salisbury. Then but a word; My present cares ill brook long interruption. Grey. Behold the blossom of the spring, how fair! Yet in his velvet bosom lurks the worm, And hourly wastes him of his choicest sweets; Not less a foe is slow-consuming grief To beautyâ You may remember when we last conferr'd The gracious purport of your words to what Concern'd lord Raymond, when you taught his suit To hope a prosperous issue; thus by me he speaks: In the recesses of the hallow'd shrine, Where with him stands the sable-vested priest, He waits thy coming; there with pious vows Exchang'd even now to consecrate thee his. May every rose lip'd son of light look down, And smile propitious on the joyful hour! Lady Salisbury. Is this a season meet for a such a theme? Grey. For gracious acts all seasons should be meet; Heaven shews the bright example; ever prompt T'incline when virtue lifts her suppliant eye. But say, that for the present he forbore His earnest suit, say, shall tomorrow make Him happy? or tomorrow's night perchance? Orâwhat shall be the bright succeeding day? Lady Salisbury. I know not: nor will I submit me or To promis'd league or tye; no, tho' thou shouidst plead Even with an angel's tongue. Grey. You will not, lady! Know thenâthis night, this hour must make thee his. Lady Salisbury. This night! this hour! who'll make me his this hour? Grey. A power, my lady, thou shalt learn to fear: Force, force superior, that with giant hand Plucks e'en the monarch from his throne; difrobes The virgin of her honour, while distress With streaming eyes and loose dishevel'd hair Holds forth her supplicating hands in vain. Lady Salisbury. I know the monster thou woud'st fright me with, But I despise his powerâHast thou ne'er heard? Learn then of me a truth, a golden truth, Grav'd on the register of hoary Time: Virtue, with her own native strength upheld, Can brave the shock of ruffian force, unmov'd As is the rock, whose firm-set base not all The tumult of the western surge can shake, Tho' the fierce winds uplift him to the stars. Grey. This is a truth indeed may hold a place On fancy's tinsel page, what will avail Thy virtue's boasted powers when thou shalt see Torn from thy feeble arms all thou hold'st dear? Yes, lady, thy lord William, thy lov'd son. Lady Salisbury. âHa! save him Heaven!âHe dare not sureâand yetâ Grey. Think, lady, think upon thy son. Lady Salisbury. Protect Him, O ye powers celestial, angels watch His steps, and hover round his harmless head! Grey. Say, will you to the altar, lady? Lady Salisbury. Sooner to my grave. Grey. Thy obstinacy on his headâWho waits? Enter a Ruffian. Lady Salisbury. What would'st thou here? Hence, execrable wretch! Thou mak'st my blood run cold. Lord William. Oh mother! I am frighten'd. Lady Salisbury. Dearest lamb! Hast thou no terrors for thyself?âOh Salisbury!â Hast thou no fears?âOh! I cou'd tell thee what Like thunder wou'd apal thy hearing, shrink Up every nerve within thy blasted frame, And make thee nothingâFear not, love. Grey. Think not With empty sounds to shake our purpose, say, Will you comply? Lady Salisbury. My little innocent! Thou dar'st not, fell as is thy natureâmy love! My life! Grey. Convey lord William hence. Lord William. Oh! save me, mother, save me. Lady Salisbury. Forbear your impious hands, forbear. Grey. Or to the altar, or by all therein I swear, this moment wrests him from thy view. Lady Salisbury. Inhuman that thou art! can nothing move Thee?âOh! those little harmless looks wou'd preach Even to the hungry lion, make him pause, And turn his rage to pity. Grey. Nay, madamâ Lady Salisbury. Forbear, and I will go,âwhither? Distraction! I will rouse The castleâhelpâmy cries shall tear the roofs. Help, help, Oh help!âthe mother and the son. Grey. Your cries are vainâ Enter Lord Salisbury. Lord Salisbury. Hold!âwhat is't ye do? Grey. He here again! Lord Salisbury. Speak, lady, would these men have wrong'd thee? Pale fear is on thy cheekâ [Eleanor removes lord William. Exit Grey and Ruffian.] Lady Salisbury. Cold horror hath o'ercome me. Lord Salisbury. Ever lov'd! Sure thou wert sore distress'd, I heard thee cry. Lady Salisbury. Ah sore distress'd indeed! the hand of peril Was on me; violence and murder star'd Me full in all their hideous forms! Lord Salisbury. Gracious powers! my fear, my fear, new-wak'd For thee it was, as Heaven decreed, that urg'd Me back, and brought me to thy timely rescue. Lady Salisbury. 'Twas Heaven indeed that brought thee hither now! Yet I have wonderous fears: thou art but one Surrounded by a legion of those fiends. Enter Raymond, Grey and armed Knights. Raymond. Where is the audacious man that hath presum'd To question with such bold intrusion? Lord Salisbury. If him you mean Who took the part of feeble innocence Against the ruffian's arm,âhe's here. Raymond. Which of you, slaves have suffer'd him to enter? Knight. My lord, he bad us to unbar the gates, Driven by the tempest, as he said, to seek The proffer'd shelter he had late declin'd: Pardon, if deeming him your honour'd guest, We answer'd him with prompt compliance. Raymond. Say what dark purpose is't hath brought thee hither? Confess thee true, or by the blessed Saints Thou shalt have cause to mourn the hour which mov'd Thee, daring as thou art, t'approach our castle. Lord Salisbury. To other regions, other climes with threats Like these, where proud oppression lords it: here The free-born subject knows not what it is To be in awe of arbitrary power. Raymond. I will know what thou art. Lord Salisbury. Even what thou seest Am I; a man not prompt to offer wrong, Yet of that frame, I brook not to behold A noble lady made the prey of ruffians. Raymond. Intruder bold as thou art officious! wherefore Should'st thou concern thee in this lady's cause? Lord Salisbury. The cause of innocence should be the cause Of allâConfess thee, lord, was't nobly done, To let those bold, those rude assailants loose, And give a sanction to such foul proceedings? Raymond. Pilgrim, hast thou forgot thee? Who am I? Lord Salisbury. Who art thou! Ask, ask thy deeds, And they will answer. The breath of fame hath told How base they have been; they are gone abroad, And the pure air is tainted with their foulness. Raymond. Presuming slave! whoe'er thou art, for thy Unlicenc'd bearing dearly shalt thou answer. Hence with the bold defamer; bind him fast; Be instant death his lot should he resistâ Seize him, I say. Lady Salisbury. Oh spare him, spareâ Lord Salisbury. Out servile ministers! Ye know not who it is ye wou'd attemptâ Oppressive lord! whom nor the sacred bond Of justice, nor of hospitality Controls, regard me: while with sight More dire than e'er of Gorgon feign'd, I strike theeâ Now, Raymond, if thou hast of noble fire One spark within thee, draw thy sword; come on, And meet my arm; wake all that's man within thee. Come onâ 'Tis Salisbury, Salisbury, calls thee to the strife. [Flings off his disguise.] Lady Salisbury. Heaven shield my dearest lord! Raymond. âSalisbury!âthen what am I?â Lord Salisbury. Vengeance at length is arm'd; thy fate cries out, And honour, injur'd honour claims aloud Her victim. Raymond. âSecure thou seem'st of fate, but fall who will A victim, let the swordâ [Drawing.] Grey. What would you do?â [Aside. Holding his arm.] Look not to know him, all may yet be wellâ Be not abus'd, my lord: this is a plot, Devis'd with purpose to effect thy ruin. Lord Salisbury. Ha! what dost say? Grey. Believe him not, my lord. He! he lord Salisbury! 'Tis all a trick, an artful cheat, and he A lyar trac'dâ Lord Salisbury. Nay then my swordâ âDishonest knights! [Going to attack Raymond, he is disarmed.] Lady Salisbury. Now by these tears do him no violence; He is, he is my husband. Grey. Regard her not: He hath conspir'd against thee, and demands The hand of justice. Lord Salisbury. Will ye not ope ye heavens, and instant send Your thunder to my aid?âUnhand me villains, Or, by the powers of vengeance, I will dash You piecemeal. Raymond. Bear the traitor hence, and bind His stubborn arms: bestow the lady safe Within her chamber. Lady Salisbury. I will not part my husbandâHold your handsâ They overpower meâBarbarous, barbarous men! Lord Salisbury. Ruffians forbear your more than impious hands. Lady Salisbury. Yet hear me, Raymondâby these streaming eyes Oh! hear me yetâ Raymond. Awayâ Lord Salisbury. Slaves! murderers! [They are forced off severally.] Raymond. Away with him, awayâhonour is lost, And shame must henceforth be my only portion. [Exeunt omnes.] End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Raymond and Grey. Grey. My lord, you waste the precious hours in cold Irresolute delays: nor circumstance Nor time admit of long deliberation. Raymond. âWou'd I had never seen this fatal mansion! Grey. A sorry wish, my lord. Behold the fierce, The lordly ranger of the desert wild; No sluggish fears he knows; he pauses not, Nor looks behind, but onward speeds him till He gripes the trembling prey: be ever thus The youth, whom thirst of love and beauty fires. Raymond. âAway; call forth my trainânay murmur not: Command that ere the lark proclaim the morn They hold them each prepar'd. Here I will rest, If rest I can, this night; to-morrow's sun Shall see me fled for ever from these walls. Grey. âGoâI detain thee not. Summon thy train, mount the swift steed, away; The gates shall open to thy flightâbut know, That shame and scorn shall follow at thy heels. Yet worse; the insulted baron next pursues thee: Nor rocks, nor mountains, nor opposing seas Shall stay him, but with more than mortal rage He shall assail thee. Raymond. âAre there no other means? Grey. None. Raymond. No other way but murder? Horrid thought!â Oh Grey if e'er the dagger's drawn I feel Such perturbation here, what then, oh what Shall prove my portion when 'tis steep'd in blood? The drops can from the point be wip'd away, But never from the mind. Grey. Lift, lift thine eye, And let it gaze upon the bright reward. Riches and honours grace the swelling act, While beauty, like the ruby-crowned morn, When first she peers upon the mountain top, Comes smiling on to meet youâThese are objects, My lord, would irritate the palsied arm Itself of fear; excite the lagging blood, And spur it on to acts of noble daring. Raymond. What wou'd you do?âThinkâSalisbury is a name Of all belov'd, of more than vulgar sway Throughout the land; a deed unauthoriz'd As this shall never 'scape the arm of justice. Grey. Such wary counsels shall our steps o'er-rule As may deride suspicionâOne there is, A knight among thy vassal train perhaps Unnoted: soft of speech he is, and fair; But of a heart that mocks at human feelings: Him I have sounded with reserve; and find Him not unapt to this our secret purposeâ But say, what recompense, what high reward Awaits the man, whose arm for thee enacts Such signal service? Raymond. Half my fortunes, all Wou'd I on him bestow, whose prosperous arts Shou'd make the fair one mine. Grey. She shall be thine. Raymond. But say, my friend, what tale, what rare device Shou'd fruitful art explore that might amuse Her just suspicions? Grey. Innocence, the mask Of innocence, and counterfeited sorrowâ Enter Eleanor. Eleanor. If beauty in distress, if dignity Now sinking into ruin can assail Thy pity, come, oh! come, and weep to seeâ. Grey. The countess, I suppose. Eleanor. My lord, my lord, 'Twould melt the savage into human softness, And make him howl forth pity to behold herâ Did you behold her, pale, disorder'd as She runs, now calling wildly on her lord, Again upon her son, again on thee. Sometimes, alas! she beats her beauteous bosom; Anon in frantic mood tears from her head The silken hairs, which fall in heaps unheeded; Wrings her white hands, and weeps and raves by turns, Till nature spent and wearied gives her pause. Raymond. Awayâwe will speak comfort to her sorrows. [Exit Eleanor.] âWretch that I am!âBut I will yield them up; Son, husband, all I will resign, if so I may appease her phrenzy. [Going, is detained by Grey.] Grey. Be not rash. Short is the date of every stronger passion; Unstay'd the mind of woman; by a breath Oft agitated, by a breath compos'dâ Yield them, my lord! it wou'd be madness, ruin. Raymond. Which ever way I turn, it is destruction. Grey. O'ercast with fear, thine eye takes nothing in But fancies of the sickliest hueâFor shame, Rouse, rouse my noble lord; awake, shake off This weakness. Pleasure must be woo'd with toil. Go to her, solace her; if that shou'd fail, Permit her as by stealth to visit Salisbury; At sight of him this tumult shall subside. Raymond. With love and pity I am torn. In vain I strive; too far I am advanc'd in error. Oh! will no hand disclose a path whereby I may return?âAccurs'd be thou, myself; And doubly be accurs'd that fatal hour I turn'd mine ear to thy destructive counsels. [Goes out in great agitation. Grey alone. âMy hopes begin to totter. If he resign them, Salisbury is appeas'd, And he retires: what then becomes of Grey? On me, on me of course the tempest falls. That must not beâHe goes to see her nowâ Who knows what new-sprung hope may follow thence? There is a charm in soft distress, that works Upon the soul like magic; causing love Oft times, as oft exciting loose desireâ It is most apt. I will, before he goes To her, explore each access to his heart; Attack each avenue that leads to virtue; Try every mining art that may assist The loose contagion: Shou'd he seize her beauties, Farewel remorse; then dies the injur'd husband. [Exit. Scene opening, discovers lord Salisbury on the ground, in chains. Enter Leroches. Leroches. Alas! on the cold ground. I fear his wrongs Have made him mad; I heard him rageâMy lordâ Rise, rise, my lord, and speak to thy Leroches. Lord Salisbury. âThou art unkind. Leroches. Oh! wou'd to Heaven that I cou'd ease thy troubles! Lord Salisbury. I had in sweet oblivion lost myself And every care; why hast thou call'd me back To hated recollection?âO my wrongs! My wrongs! they now come rushing o'er my headâ Again, again, they wake me into madness. Leroches. Thy wrongs shall be reveng'd. Lord Salisbury. Torn from them both! âLet me not think. Leroches. Think on our friends, my lord: Perhaps even now they are at hand; and soon Will thunder at the gates. Lord Salisbury. Is't possible? Or do my eyes but false persuade me to it?â In trammels! and within my walls! beneath That roof where I am sole-invested lord!â Leroches. Look, behold. Lord Salisbury. I see; thou art dishonour'd. Leroches. 'Tis the will Of Heaven, and I submit me to my fortunes. Lord Salisbury. How cam'st thou hither? Leroches. By command, as I Suppose, ofâbut I will not name him. Lord Salisbury. Blasts Upon him!âDidst thou see my wife? Leroches. No, my lord. Lord Salisbury. Nor my son? Leroches. My lord I saw not either. Lord Salisbury. Nor of either heard? Leroches. No, my good lord, I trust that they are safe. Lord Salisbury. Hear me, sweet Heaven! ye throned powers above, Dread arbiters of mortal doings, hearâ Dry not instant up the springs of life, But grant me measure of revenge. Unbind, For pity these dishonour'd limbs unbind, And give this monster to my willing arm: If I not firmly gripe, if I not tear With more than savage force his hated formâ Enter a Knight. Traitor! What hast thou done? Bring forth my honour'd dameâ Haste, bring her instant; give her to my arms, Uninjur'd, undefil'd, or by the souls Of the most holy and unspotted saintsâ Spare me, good HeavenâI am, I am to blameâ Imports thy coming aught with me? Knight. Behold In me thy better angel, come to warn Thee of unguarded dangerâOh my lord! My lord! beware of horrid treacheryâ Whatever knight thou not'st, that traitor like Approacheth thee with smiles; that with the charm Of honey'd speech would practice on thy hearing, Of him bewareâThey seek thy ruin; chance Betray'd their purpose; I was touch'd with pity. [Going.] Lord Salisbury. Nay, go not yet. Knight. Suspicion's on the watch; My thoughts are scarce my own. Lord Salisbury. It is for guilt, Not conscious honesty to taste of fear. Knight. Know then, my lord, tho' strict necessity Enrolls me in the list of Raymond's train, Yet doth my soul abhor the unhallow'd service. Lord Salisbury. Be thou but faithful, and discover all Thou know'st, so shalt thou thrive in Salisbury's favour. Knight. Fear not my faith. But shall lord Salisbury prove A friend indeed? for I shall need thy arm And interest both against so great a foe. Lord Salisbury. Now by my honour, ever yet held dear, I will protect thee 'gainst whatever foe. Knight. Morton desires but thisâKnow then, that late As by the western porch I stood, my ear Was met by certain voices: strait I turn'd; And thro' the crevice of th'adjoining door Was known that same insidious knight and Grey, In low, but earnest converse. Thee they nam'd: And I cou'd hear the latter, whilst he said, âA dagger is the best. With honest smiles, âAnd fair-instructed speech you must essay him. âThy peace and fortunes on this feat depend.â Lord Salisbury. I thank thee for this warning; and ere long Shall recompense thy love. Morton. Had I the power To serve thee, as the will, thou should'st not wear Those marks of shameâBut oh! the unhappy countess! Lord Salisbury. What, what of her? Morton. Alas! to think the pangs She feels this moment, torn as she hath been By rude barbarians from her lord and son. Lord Salisbury. But is she safe? hath not dishonour reach'd her? Morton. Oh may she never know dishonour!âYet Lord Raymondâ Lord Salisbury. Perish the detested name For ever! for it makes my blood outcourse The wholesome speed of nature. Morton. It is true, He holds her in his powerâ Lord Salisbury. He does, he does; And I do live to know it. Morton. But I trust He will not use that powerâFarewel, my lord; I will away, and gather all I can Of their condition. Lord Salisbury. Thou shalt win my love. See, see my wife, oh! see her if thou can'st: Speak comfort to her. Say the only pangs I feel Are for her safety. Bid her hope for timely aid; But to remember still, the virtuous mind Will welcome death itself before dishonour. Morton. To see her, is a task I fear will foil My utmost; but no art shall be untried. [Exit Morton. Lord Salisbury. Is there no way to freedom?âOh my friends! My friends! Haste, Ardolf, haste to my revenge. Leroches. Thy fierce impatience, thy untoward will It is, my lord, that hath betray'd our safeties. To Ardolf deaf, thou would'st not wait his succours; Deaf too to me, thou would'st approach the castle. Lord Salisbury. Fear not: this stranger, like Heav'n's brighter star, Hath risen propitiousâHeav'ns! but what of that? My wife!âperhaps even now within the gripe Of fell incontinence she strugglesâBeware That thoughtâdown, down, or I shall rage to madness. Leroches. My lord, he wou'd notâ Lord Salisbury. Hark!â Leroches. He wou'd not, dare not, sure: or if he dare, Her inborn dignity, her virtueâ Lord Salisbury. Peace!â Lady Salisbury. Hold off your brutal hands! [from without. Lord Salisbury. 'Tis she! 'tis she! The slave assails herâLet me forthâ Slaves! murderers! instant let me forth, or Iâ Lady Salisbury. Hast thou no touch of pity? Lord Salisbury. Horror! horror! Out hair! out by the roots! nor let a grain Be left to tell there grew such honours there. Lady Salisbury. O my lord! my lord!â Lord Salisbury. By Heav'n I will not be restrain'dâ [Lero. strives to stay him. Nor all your bolts, nor barriers, all the pow'rs Of hell united shall withhold me from herâ [Exit. Leroches. Preserve him, Heaven! I fear Some act of horrid importâOh! she comes! Wild, wild as the rough ocean vex'd with storms. Enter Lady Salisbury, Eleanor, Morton. Lord Salisbury. I will have vengeance. Such an outrageâNo, I will not weep. They think I have no means: 'Tis false: I will resume a spirit. Eleanor. Alas! alas! Lady Salisbury. I had a son; sweet William! thou hast heard Him prattle: there was music on his tongue. Eleanor. Can Heav'n behold such crimes, and not awake It's thunders? Lady Salisbury. Weep'st thou? I can weep myself; I have some causeâHe is my husband, who Will part us?âCold, cold, cold. The rains beat sore, And the winds make a noise; 'tis a rough night; No little star to guide his darkling stepsâ The Heav'ns do rain down pity for me. Eleanor. Rave Not thus, dear lady; oh! be comforted. Lady Salisbury. Yes, yes; I know: these trifles have disturb'd me. The bird is rifl'd. Poor flutterer! oh! it was nought to spoil Her of her little hopeâDid'st thou not see Her valiant mate, how fierce he shook his plumes, And peck'd at them? Did he not?âHe had sav'd His mistress from the spoilers, but they snar'd him. Lord Salisbury entering. Where is the slave? I will not brook delay. Lady Salisbury. He's come! he's comeâNow, ruffians, I have found Him, we will die together e'er you part us. Lord Salisbury. Hell! what are your blackest horrors to this? Lady Salisbury. We will have justiceâBury Grey alive. Lord Salisbury. She's lost! Lady Salisbury. Say you!âPut Raymond to the torture. Lord Salisbury. I will tear him joint by joint. Lady Salisbury. But they will part usâ They comeâYou shall notâno; no pow'r on earth Shall force meâNow they pullâHold, hold, my lordâ Yet closerânow, now, now. Lord Salisbury. My wife, my Ela! Lost as thou art, oh! do not leave me. Morton. Distressful sight!âOh most inhuman Grey! Eleanor. Nature, my lord, unequal to the conflict, Has for a space retir'd within herself; But shortly to return. This interval Of death-like quiet will, I trust, recal Her safer sensesâShe revives. Lady Salisbury. But this is strangeâ Eleanor. My lord, Speak to her; sooth her, and she will be calm. Lord Salisbury. Speak to her, sooth herâwhat have I with her? with thee? Oh agonizing hour! Had I but perish'd In the same wave that buried my lov'd friends, It had been wellâ'Twas cruelty to save me. Lady Salisbury. Am I indeed awake?âLet me stand upâ What is the matter? Lord Salisbury. My poor, injur'd wife! Lady Salisbury. Nay, but inform me, I am overdoubtful; I wou'd believe, I knowâif what I now Behold, be not a dream, you are my husband. Lord Salisbury. The wretch that was so call'd. Lady Salisbury. Alack! alack! Sure I have been afflicted soreâMy lord! My life!âwhy dost thou start from me?âOh take Me to thy arms! for I have need of comfort. Lord Salisbury. Art thou not undone? Lady Salisbury. Indeed I have wept. Lord Salisbury. Lost, stain'd, dishonour'd by a villain? Lady Salisbury. How, My lord! Think'st thou that I have other wrongs To weep than thou hast seen? Lord Salisbury. I heard thee cry. Lady Salisbury. I know not what I didâDishonour'd!âO! The thought wakes every pulse to indignation. Lord Salisbury. What! did he not assail thee? Lady Salisbury. NoâAssail me! Lord Salisbury. Then art thou safe, thy honour unassay'd? Lady Salisbury. So witness Heaven! Lord Salisbury. The God of Heaven be prais'd! Lady Salisbury. âAnd coud'st thou think so meanly of me?âOh! I had let the life-blood from this bosom forth Ere I had brook'd dishonour. Lord Salisbury. Best of thy sex!âThy cries like daggers pierc'd me; And fearful fancy pictur'd such a scene As hurried me to madnessâBut thou art safe, My wife is safe! and I am blest again. Lady Salisbury. My heart o'erjoysâYet wherefore do I fear? Lord Salisbury. I had forgotâmy son; for him thou fear'st. Lady Salisbury. Not only for my son, but for thyself, Thy precious self I trembleâOh this fiend! The slaves and agents of destruction, black And bold, are station'd round him, and but wait Their master's nod. Leroches. Wou'd we were safe bestow'd Without this fearful prison! Lady Salisbury. Wou'd we were!â Think, think, my lord, is there no way to flight? Lord Salisbury. Thou hast recall'd to my remembrance what, If seconded by this our plighted friend, May claim a serious and attentive hearing. Morton. Small is the service I can boast my lord; In all my best I shall be prompt to aid you. Lord Salisbury. Hear thenâDeep underneath this vaulted ground, Curious and close, by our forefathers scoop'd, I do remember me there is a dark, And secret mine, which leads by many a maze Without the castle. Not far thence there stands Within the bosom of an aged grove, An house for pious uses set apart, The hallow'd seat of godly brethren: there I fear not we shall rest secure of ill. Lady Salisbury. Most opportune as could our wishes frameâ But oh! our little hope! our younger care! Morton. My life shall answer for lord William's safety, Lady Salisbury. Then let us forth. Morton. The night is over young; The castle's yet awake, and wou'd but mock The attempt. Lord Salisbury. Say, what shall be the appointed hour? Morton. Some three hours hence, my lord; or ere the clock Perchance have told the second watchâAnd now That squint suspicion mar not, let us part. Lady Salisbury. Then must we part?âBut 'tis to save us all. Three hoursâfarewel!âOh! they will be three long Long hours to me. Lady Salisbury. Farewel my best!âMean time Leroches, we will rest us here apartâFarewel, Farewel! thou soother sweet of every care! The god, that loves the unsullied mind, descend, And be thy guardian till we meet again. [Ex. omnes. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE a Forest, and Cottage. Enter Ardolf and a Knight. Ardolf. The storm is laid; and from the parting clouds See where the moon steps forth, pale goddess, Chearing the dark dull brow of haggard nightâ This is the forest, that the Cottager's, Or I do err, th'appointed place of meeting. Knight. It is: behold the rock, as was describ'd, The torrent foaming down his rugged side. Ardolf. See, the bright harbinger of morning climbs The steep of Heaven: they're in the first reposeâ Wake, peasant, wakeâHow balmy sweet the sleep Of him, who stretches under rustic roof! His task of labour o'er, content he lays Him on his rushy couch; nor elves, nor goblins, The coinage of swol'n surfeit or of guilt, Approach his peaceful pillowâWake, I say; Peasant, awake. Enter a Peasant from the cottage. Peasant. Who calls? What is your business, that at this late hour You make the forest echoe with your cries? Ardolf. Peasant, are there not certain travellers Within thy cottage? Peasant. No. What! saw you not Two stranger pilgrims pass this way? Peasant. I did. Two such arrived e'er the lark had risen From her moss cabin, or the cock Gave note of morn. Ardolf. Say, gentle cottager, Where may they now be lodg'd? Peasant. Nay, stranger, that I know not. They went hence about the time The bat begins her twilight play. Ardolf. 'Tis strange They shou'd departâLeft they no message? Peasant. None. They said, they wish'd to see the neighbouring abbey; But wou'd to-night partake our homely fare. [Returns into the cottage. Ardolf. We now are in the precincts of the castle; But whether to proceed, or wait, perchance If they return, I know notâHark! some one Approachesâwho is there? Enter Leroches. Leroches! Leroches. Happily metâwhere are your friends? Ardolf. At hand; and well appointed eachâwhere is my Lord? Leroches. In chains; in his own castle basely bound; Torn from his wife and sonâHow I escap'dâ But haste; time is too precious now for more: His life hangs upon each eventful moment. Ardolf. In chains! his life in danger!âHo! my friends! To horse, quick; we will rescue him, or perish. Leroches. Ardolf, pursue the eastern causeway you; I with a chosen few will trace the path, Which led me from the postern. Ardolf. Wisely caution'd: Divided thus, we wage an easier war. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE within the Castle. Enter Grey and Morton. Grey. My trusty Morton! well hast thou repaid The nicer hope which I repos'd in thee. âTheir unprovided rest outruns my wishes. Morton. Fools! not to see thro' my hypocrisy: That in the borrow'd guise of honest friendship, I studied but to lure them to my toilsâ Conceal'd from upper light, it yields a safe Retreat; through that they purpos'd their escape. Grey. Within the secret womb of that same vault, When all the castle's hush'd, their bleeding trunks We will deposit. Morton. Yesâwe will be bloody. Grey. Here is the weaponâBe firm, and prosper. [Morton receives a dagger and goes out. âThou too, unthinking fool, must this hour bleedâ Wou'd it were overâthey may chance to wakeâ Thou Sleep! still child of sable-hooded Night, Befriend us. From thy dark Lethean cell Upconjure all thy store of drowsy charms; Lock fast their lids, o'erpower each torpid sense, That they awake not e'er the deed be doneâ [Bell tolls. âThe second watch; and like death's curfew, deep And dismal verberates the solemn knell. Enter a Knight. Knight. A stranger, sir, who calls him Oswald, waits Without the castle, and wou'd speak with you. Grey. Oswald! He is our friend. Knight. I have not learn'd His errand, but as it wou'd seem, he comes With news that much imports thy present hearing. Grey. I'll speak with him anon. Knight. I know not what Their purpose, but even now, as on the tower I stood, which high o'erlooks the eastern causeway, Methought I heard the distant sound of horse, As hither bent in full career. Grey. The sound Of horse!âLook out; call up our knights; away. [Exit Knight. âWhat can delay him?âShould my present hopes Miscarry, I will bear the lady hence, And make her hostage for my safety; nay, Perchance, what I have some incentives to, Supplant them both, the lover and the husbandâ He comes!â Re-enter Morton. Morton. Oh! that the earth wou'd yawn and cover me! Or that Heaven's quick-devouring fires had shrunk And wither'd up this arm when it was rais'dâ Eyes; eyes! why clos'd you not e'er you beheld. The ghastly ruin? Grey. Speak direct; are they dispos'd? Morton. Awayâthou hast destroy'd my peace for everâ Had you beheld him as he lay, struggling In the cold gripe of death; his cheek o'erspread With livid pale; those eyes, that late shot forth So radiant, now quite sunk; their burning lamps Extinct; while from the deep-mouth'd wound, As from a copious fountain, issued forth Life's purple springsâ I wou'd have fled, but horror for a space Suspended every power. Grey. 'Tis wellâ Hast thou then slain Lord Salisbury? At thy own peril be itâHelp! he has slain The innocent! They're murder'd, foully murder'd by a slave. [Exit. Morton. The earth has teem'd with prodigies, this sure Out-monsters all. Enter Raymond, hastily, with a sword in his hand. Raymond. On what purpose art thou here? Morton. Lord Raymond cannot be a stranger sure. Raymond. A dagger!âwhat hast thou done? Morton. Did not my lord approve the deed? Raymond. What deed? Morton. How's this?âMy lord, I had your sanction, ratified by Grey, With promise of high recompence the hour When Salisbury shou'd expire. Raymond. Accurs'd be he that told thee so, and thou That gav'st him credit! Morton. This is strange! Raymond. Approve! I did not; by the pow'rs of Truth I did notâ Remorseless villain!âWhere, where shall I hide Me? whither shall I fly?âOh deed of horror!â Thy blood, detested hireling, shall in part Compensateâ Morton. HoldâHe cannot sure dissembleâ Wish you, my lord, this deed were yet undone? Raymond. What wou'd the monster?âOh! cou'd I recall His life by killing twenty thousand slaves Like thee, it were a comfort. Morton. I believe That you are innocent; know then, my lordâ He livesâhe sleeps; and sleeps secure of harm. Raymond. Take heed thou dost not trifle. Morton. I will confess Me true, and Heav'n forgive my foul intent! I undertook to slay this innocent; Approach'd him as a friendâI saw his sufferings; Saw his distracted wife: at length I curs'd, And in my heart abjur'd the wicked purpose. Raymond. Had'st thou the goodness? Then, perhapsâ Morton. I thought Haply that you yourself might soon relent. This instrument of purpos'd cruelty, I took; and with a fair-devised tale Of Salisbury's death, amus'd the guilty wretch That would ensnare your quiet. Raymond. Is this honest? Morton. Approach, my lord, approach, and let your eye Be witness of my truthâIn doing thus, I thought I should be deem'd Lord Raymond's friend. Raymond. Thou wert the best of friends!âRetire thou nowâ [Exit Mor. One way there yet remains to reconcile This double war, and heal my tortur'd bosomâ Thou, that so soundly sleep'st, unguarded thus [going towards the side scene. Against whatever ill that may approach thee, Awake! rouse from the bed of listless sleep, And see who comes to greet thee. Enter Lord Salisbury. Lord Salisbury. âDo I dream? Or am I in the regions of the unblest, Beset with monsters?âTho' thou art a fiend, I will attempt thee. Raymond. Rush not on my weapon. I have sought thee on a cause which honour loves, And wou'd not have thee marr my soul's fair purpose. Lord Salisbury. Inglorious! base! O shame to manhood!âDearly Shalt thou atone the accumulated wrongs That I do bleed withal. Nor sea, nor earth, Tho' thou should'st traverse her remotest climes, Shall shelter thee from my determin'd fury. Raymond. Think not that I shall fly thee; or that I Have sought thee now, but on such terms as even May challenge thy applause. I come a foe Indeed, but I do come a generous foe. Lord Salisbury. A generous foe!âThe brave indeed aspire To generous acts; their every thought looks up, And honour's dictates are their only function: But thou!âwhat terms woud'st thou propose? What act Of that essential virtue, that may raze The ignoble stains wherewith thou art polluted? Raymond. The ignoble, and the brave alike have err'd; And he, that re-ascends to virtue's height, Does often snatch a wreath, which never bloom'd On safer wisdom's browâFirst let me loose Those ignominious bonds, which have indeed My own dishonour'd, not the wearer's arm. [Takes off his chains.] Lord Salisbury. âSay, to what purpose tends this honest seeming? Raymond. That I have wrong'd thee, I confessâtake this [Gives him a sword, and draws another.] The only restitution I have left. I know thou never canst forgive, nor I Forget; the sword then judge between. Lord Salisbury. âIndeed! Lives there so much of honour then within thee? Spite of the mighty wrongs which thou hast done Me, I do thank theeâ Raymond. Now Fortune mark her favourite!â [Loses his sword in the encounter. Then she is partial, and I must submit. Lord Salisbury. Take up thy sword again; my fair revenge Disdains too cheap a conquest. Raymond. 'Tis too much. Oh! generous! generous even to cruelty!â Some way I wou'd repay theeâOh! that I [Takes up his sword. Had never seen thy wife!âIt may not beâ Then let me tear for ever from my breast The guilty passion: thus I thank theeâthus [Wounds himself. Atone the mischiefs, thatâohâ [Falls. Lord Salisbury. This indeed Atones for all. Thou much-misguided youth! What tempted thee to stray so wide from honour? Raymond. Ask, ask that villain; he will answer allâ That villain Grey! whose wicked arts seduc'd meâ ForgiveâI die, I die; a dreadful proof What ills await the wretch, who gives his earâ To vicious counselsâ Lord Salisbury. Dreadful proof, indeed!â I do forgive thee, so forgive thee Heaven! Re-enter Morton. Now where's my wife? where is my friend Leroches? Morton. My lord, by my assistance he has fled. I saw how vain your purpose to escape; His single flight was unobserv'dâyour friends In quest of whom he hasted, are arriv'd; [A trumpet is heard. That trumpet speaks it. Lord Salisbury. It is, it is sir Ardolf!âSee! he comes. Enter Ardolf, and Knights. Ardolf. My noble friend!âsafe! crown'd with conquest too! Lord Salisbury. Saw you Leroches? Ardolf. My lord, He sought the castle by a private path; I thought he had been here by this. Lord Salisbury. 'Tis well. But where's my wife? my son? my soul is maim'd Of half it's joys till I've again embrac'd them. Enter Eleanor. Eleanor. My lord! my lord! the countess and lord Williamâ Send, send and save them from destruction. With horses that outstrip the winds, the villains Have borne her from the castle. Lord Salisbury. Ravish'd by villains!âMount your horses, hasteâ Ardolf. Say, which way have they fled? Eleanor. West of the castle: Heaven grant their swiftness mock not your best speed! Ardolf. Now good my lord, if I might speakâ Lord Salisbury. Speak not To me, but forth and scower the countryâ Ardolf. Hark! Methought I heard a voiceâ Eleanor. And I, methoughtâ Perhaps Heav'n has been kind; perhaps 'tis she. Lady Salisbury entering. Now hush'd be ev'ry fearâWhere, where's my heroe, That I may once more hold him to my bosom. Enter Lady Salisbury and Lord William, conducted by Leroches. Lord Salisbury. 'Tis she! 'tis she!â My wife is in my arms again!âSpeak, speak; O! whence this precious, this unlook'd event? Lady Salisbury. When the fell ruffian, When Grey with impious hands had snatch'd us hence, Then came my guardian angel, came your friend, And rescued us from ruin. Leroches. Happy hour! I took the path which brought me to their rescue! The atrocious villain fell beneath this arm. Lord Salisbury. My wife! My son! my friend! my God! my guardian God! Eleanor. O joy! that they are here again! Lord Salisbury. They're here! they're here! my wife and son are here!â Proclaim it, O ye sons of light! spread wide Your starry pinions, angels, spread them wide, And trumpet-loud throughout th'unmeasur'd tracts Of highest Heaven, that virtue is made happy. Lady Salisbury. Let the Sun cease to shine, the Planets cease, Drop every star from his ethereal height, E'er I forget thee, source of every good! Lord Salisbury. Friends, I am much beholden to you all. My love! the gloom, that overspread our morn, Is now dispers'd; our late mishaps Recall'd, shall be th'amusing narrative, And story of our future evening, oft Rehears'd. Our son tooâhe shall hang upon The sounds, and lift his little hands in praise To Heav'n; taught by his mother's bright example, That, to be truly good, is to be bless'd. FINIS.</field>
