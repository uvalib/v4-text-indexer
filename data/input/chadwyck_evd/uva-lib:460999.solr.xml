      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene. A Blacksmith's shop; Wat Tyler at work within; a May-pole before the door. Alice, Piers, &amp;c. SONG. Cheerful on this holiday, Welcome we the merry May. On every sunny hillock spread, The pale primrose lifts her head; Rich with sweets, the western gale Sweeps along the cowslip'd dale; Every bank, with violets gay, Smiles to welcome in the May. The linnet from the budding grove, Chirps her vernal song of love. The copse resounds the throstle's notes, On each wild gale sweet music floats; And melody from every spray, Welcomes in the merry May. Cheerful on this holiday, Welcome we the merry May. [Dance [During the dance, Tyler lays down his hammer, and sits mournfully down before the door. Hob Carter. Why so sad, neighbour?âdo not these gay sports, This revelry of youth, recall the days When we too mingled in the revelry, And lightly tripping in the morris dance, Welcomed the merry month? Tyler. Ay, we were young, No cares had quell'd the heyday of the blood: We sported deftly in the April morning, Nor mark'd the black clouds gathering o'er our noon, Nor fear'd the storm of night. Hob. Beshrew me, Tyler, But my heart joys to see the imps so cheerful! Young, hale, and happy, why should they destroy These blessings by reflection Tyler. Look ye, neighbourâ You have known me long. Hob. Since we were boys together And play'd at barley-brake, and danced the morris. Some five-and-twenty years! Tyler. Was not I young, And hale, and happy? Hob. Cheerful as the best. Tyler. Have not I been a staid, hard-working man? Up with the lark at labour; sober, honest, Of an unblemish'd character? Hob. Who doubts it? There's never a man in Essex bears a better. Tyler. And shall not these, though young, and hale, and happy, Look on with sorrow to the future hour? Shall not reflection poison all their pleasures? When Iâthe honest, staid, hard-working Tyler, Toil through the long course of the summer's day, Still toiling, yet still poor! when with hard labour Scarce can I furnish out my daily food, And age comes on to steal away my strength, And leave me poor and wretched! Why should this be? My youth was regularâmy labour constantâ I married an industrious, virtuous woman; Nor while I toil'd and sweated at the anvil, Sat she neglectful of her spinning-wheel. Hob! I have only six groats in the world, And they must soon by law be taken from me. Hob. Curse on these taxesâone succeeds anotherâ Our ministers, panders of a king's will, Drain all our wealth away, waste it in revels, And lure, or force away our boys, who should be The props of our old age, to fill their armies, And feed the crows of France. Year follows year, And still we madly prosecute the war; Draining our wealth, distressing our poor peasants, Slaughtering our youthsâand all to crown our chiefs With glory!âI detest the hell-sprung name. Tyler. What matters me who wears the crown of France? Whether a Richard or a Charles possess it? They reap the gloryâthey enjoy the spoilâ We payâwe bleed! The sun would shine as cheerly, The rains of heaven as seasonably fall, Though neither of these royal pests existed. Hob. Nay, as for that we poor men should fare better; No legal robbers then should force away The hard-earn'd wages of our honest toil. The Parliament for ever cries more money, The service of the state demands more money; Just heaven! of what service is the state? Tyler. Oh, 'tis of vast importance! who should pay for The luxuries and riots of the court? Who should support the flaunting courtier's pride, Pay for their midnight revels, their rich garments, Did not the state enforce?âThink ye, my friend, That I, a humble blacksmith, here at Deptford, Would part with these six groatsâearn'd by hard toil, All that I have! to massacre the Frenchmen, Murder as enemies men I never saw! Did not the state compel me? (Tax-gatherers pass by.) There they go, Privileged ruffians! [Piers &amp; Alice advance to him. Alice. Did we not dance it well to-day, my father? You know I always loved these village sports, Even from my infancy, and yet methinks I never tripp'd along the mead so gaily. You know they chose me queen, and your friend Piers Wreathed me this cowslip garland for my headâ Is it not simple?âYou are sad my father! You should have rested from your work to-day, And given a few hours up to merrimentâ But you are so serious! Tyler Serious, my good girl! I may well be so: when I look at thee It makes me sad! thou art too fair a flower To bear the wintry wind of poverty. Piers. Yet I have often heard you speak of riches Even with contempt; they cannot purchase peace, Or innocence, or virtue; sounder sleep Waits on the weary ploughman's lowly bed, Than on the downy couch of luxury Lulls the rich slave of pride and indolence. I never wish for wealth; my arm is strong, And I can purchase by it a coarse meal, And hunger savours it. Tyler. Young man, thy mind Has yet to learn the hard lesson of experience. Thou art yet young: the blasting breath of want Has not yet froze the current of thy blood. Piers. Fare not the birds well, as from spray to spray, Blithesome they bound, yet find their simple food Scatter'd abundantly? Tyler. No fancied boundaries of mine and thine Restrain their wanderings. Nature gives enough For all; but Man, with arrogant selfishness, Proud of his heaps, hoards up superfluous stores Robb'd from his weaker fellows, starves the poor, Or gives to pity what he owes to justice! Piers. So I have heard our good friend John Ball preach. Alice. My father, wherefore was John Ball imprison'd? Was he not charitable, good, and pious? I have heard him say that all mankind are brethren, And that like brethren they should love each other; Was not that doctrine pious? Tyler. Rank seditionâ High treason, every syllable, my child! The priests cry out on him for heresy, The nobles all detest him as a rebel, And this good man, this minister of Christ, This man, the friend and brother of mankind, Lingers in the dark dungeon!âMy dear Alice, Retire awhile. [Exit Alice. Piers, I would speak to thee, Even with a father's love! you are much with me, And I believe do court my conversation; Thou could'st not choose thee forth a truer friend. I would fain see thee happy, but I fear Thy very virtues will destroy thy peace. My daughterâshe is youngânot yet fifteen: Piers, thou art generous, and thy youthful heart Warm with affection; this close intimacy Will ere long grow to love. Piers. Suppose it so; Were that an evil, Walter? She is mild And cheerful, and industrious:ânow methinks With such a partner life would be most happy! Why would ye warn me then of wretchedness? Is there an evil that can harm our lot? I have been told the virtuous must be happy, And have believed it true: tell me, my friend, What shall disturb the virtuous? Tyler. Poverty, A bitter foe. Piers. Nay, you have often told me That happiness does not consist in riches. Tyler. It is most true; but tell me, my dear boy, Could'st thou be happy to behold thy wife Pining with want? the children of your loves Clad in the squalid rags of wretchedness? And, when thy hard and unremitting toil Had earn'd with pain a scanty recompense, Could'st thou be patient when the law should rob thee And leave thee without bread and pennyless? Piers. It is a dreadful picture. Tyler. 'Tis a true one. Piers. But yet methinks our sober industry Might drive away the danger! 'tis but little That I could wish; food for our frugal meals, Raiment, however homely, and a bed To shield us from the night. Tyler. Thy honest reason Could wish no more: but were it not most wretched To want the coarse food for the frugal meal? And by the orders of your merciless lord, If you by chance were guilty of being poor, To be turn'd out adrift to the bleak world, Unhoused, unfriended?âPiers, I have not been idle, I never ate the bread of indolence; Could Alice be more thrifty than her mother? Yet with but one child,âand that one how good, Thou knowest,âI scarcely can provide the wants Of nature: look at these wolves of the law, They come to drain me of my hard-earn'd wages. I have already paid the heavy tax Laid on the wool that clothes me, on my leather, On all the needful articles of life! And now three groats (and I work'd hard to earn them) The Parliament demandsâand I must pay them, Forsooth, for liberty to wear my head. [Enter Tax-gatherers. Collector. Three groats a head for all your family. Piers. Why is this money gather'd? 'tis a hard tax On the poor labourer! It can never be That Government should thus distress the people. Go to the rich for moneyâhonest labour Ought to enjoy its fruits. Collector. The state wants money, War is expensiveâ'tis a glorious war, A war of honour, and must be supported.â Three groats a head. Tyler. There, three for my own head, Three for my wife's; what will the state tax next? Collector. You have a daughter. Tyler. She is below the ageânot yet fifteen. Collector. You would evade the tax. Tyler. Sir Officer, I have paid you fairly what the law demands. [Alice and her mother enter the shop. The Taxgatherers go to her. One of them lays hold of her. She screams.âTyler goes in. Collector. You say she's under age. [Alice screams again. Tyler knocks out the Taxgatherer's brains. His companions fly. Piers. A just revenge. Tyler. Most just indeed; but in the eye of the law 'Tis murder: and the murderer's lot is mine. [Piers goes outâTyler sits down mournfully. Alice. Fly, my dear father! let us leave this place Before they raise pursuit. Tyler. Nay, nay, my child, Flight would be uselessâI have done my duty; I have punish'd the brute insolence of lust, And here will wait my doom. Wife. Oh, let us fly, My husband, my dear husband! Alice. Quit but this place, And we may yet be safe, and happy too. Tyler. It would be useless, Alice; 'twould but lengthen A wretched life in fear. [Cry without, Liberty, Liberty! Enter Mob, Hob Carter, &amp;c. crying Liberty! Liberty! No Poll-tax! No War! Hob. We have broke our chains, we will arise in anger, The mighty multitude shall trample down The handful that oppress them. Tyler. Have ye heard So soon then of my murder? Hob. Of your vengeance. Piers ran throughout the village: told the newsâ Cried out, to arms!âarm, arm for liberty; For Liberty and Justice! Tyler. My good friends, Heed well your danger, or be resolute! Learn to laugh menaces and force to scorn, Or leave me. I dare answer the bold deedâ Death must come once: return ye to your homes, Protect my wife and child, and on my grave Write why I died; perhaps the time may come, When honest Justice shall applaud the deed. Hob. Nay, nay, we are oppress'd, and have too long Knelt at our proud lords' feet; we have too long Obey'd their orders, bow'd to their caprices, Sweated for them the wearying summer's day, Wasted for them the wages of our toil, Fought for them, conquer'd for them, bled for them, Still to be trampled on, and still despised! But we have broke our chains. Tom Miller. Piers is gone on Through all the neighbouring villages, to spread The glorious tidings. Hob. He is hurried on To Maidstone, to deliver good John Ball, Our friend, our shepherd. [Mob increases. Tyler. Friends and Countrymen, Will ye then rise to save an honest man From the fierce clutches of the bloody law? Oh, do not call to mind my private wrongs, That the state drain'd my hard-earn'd pittance from me, That, of his office proud, the foul Collector Durst with lewd hand seize on my darling child, Insult her maiden modesty, and force A father's hand to vengeance; heed not this; Think not, my countrymen, on private wrongs, Remember what yourselves have long endured; Think of the insults, wrongs, and contumelies, Ye bear from your proud lordsâthat your hard toil Manures their fertile fieldsâyou plough the earth, You sow the corn, you reap the ripen'd harvest,â They riot on the produce!âthat, like beasts, They sell you with their land, claim all the fruits Which the kindly earth produces, as their own, The privilege, forsooth of noble birth! On, on to freedom; feel but your own strength, Be but resolved, and these destructive tyrants Shall shrink before your vengeance. Hob. On to London,â The tidings fly before usâthe court trembles,â LibertyâVengeanceâJustice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. Blackheath. Tyler, Hob, &amp;c. SONG. âWhen Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?â Wretched is the infant's lot, Born within the straw-roof'd cot; Be he generous, wise, or brave, He must only be a slave. Long, long labour, little rest, Still to toil to be oppress'd; Drain'd by taxes of his store, Punish'd next for being poor: This is the poor wretch's lot, Born within the straw-roof'd cot. While the peasant works,âto sleep, What the peasant sows,âto reap, On the couch of ease to lie, Rioting in revelry; Be he villain, be he fool, Still to hold despotic rule, Trampling on his slaves with scorn! This is to be nobly born. âWhen Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?â Jack Straw. The mob are up in Londonâthe proud courtiers Begin to tremble. Tom Miller. Aye, aye, 'tis time to tremble: Who'll plough their fields, who'll do their drudgery now, And work like horses to give them the harvest? Jack Straw. I only wonder we lay quiet so long. We had always the same strength; and we deserved The ills we met with for not using it. Hob. Why do we fear those animals call'd lords? What is there in the name to frighten us? Is not my arm as mighty as a Baron's? Enter Piers and John Ball. Piers (to Tyler). Have I done well, my father?âI remember'd This good man lay in prison. Tyler. My dear child, Most well; the people rise for liberty, And their first deed should be to break the chains That bind the virtuous:âOh, thou honest priest, How much hast thou endured! John Ball. Why, aye, my friend! These squalid rags bespeak what I have suffer'd. I was reviled, insulted, left to languish In a damp dungeon; but I bore it cheerilyâ My heart was gladâfor I had done my duty. I pitied my oppressors, and I sorrow'd For the poor men of England. Tyler. They have felt Their strength: look round this heath; 'tis throng'd with men Ardent for freedom: mighty is the event That waits their fortune. John Ball. I would fain address them. Tyler. Do so, my friend, and preach to them their duty. Remind them of their long-withholden rights. What ho! there; silence! Piers. Silence, there, my friends, This good man would address you. Hob. Aye, aye, hear him; He is no mealy-mouth'd court-orator, To flatter vice, and pamper lordly pride. John Ball. Friends, brethren! for ye are my brethren all; Englishmen, met in arms to advocate The cause of freedom, hear me; pause awhile In the career of vengeance!âIt is true I am a priest, but, as these rags may speak, Not one who riots in the poor man's spoil, Or trades with his religion. I am one Who preach the law of Christ; and, in my life, Would practise what he taught. The Son of God Came not to you in power: humble in mien, Lowly in heart, the man of Nazareth Preach'd mercy, justice, love: âWoe unto ye, Ye that are rich: if that ye would be saved Sell that ye have, and give unto the poor.â So taught the Saviour: Oh, my honest friends, Have ye not felt the strong indignant throb Of justice in your bosoms, to behold The lordly Baron feasting on your spoils? Have you not in your hearts arraign'd the lot That gave him on the couch of luxury To pillow his head, and pass the festive day In sportive feasts, and ease, and revelry? Have you not often in your conscience ask'd, Why is the difference; wherefore should that man, No worthier than myself, thus lord it over me, And bid me labour, and enjoy the fruits? The God within your breasts has argued thus: The voice of truth has murmur'd. Came ye not As helpless to the world? Shines not the sun With equal ray on both? Do ye not feel The self-same winds of heaven as keenly parch ye? Abundant is the earthâthe Sire of all, Saw and pronounced that it was very good. Look round: the vernal fields smile with new flowers, The budding orchard perfumes the sweet breeze, And the green corn waves to the passing gale. There is enough for all; but your proud Baron Stands up, and, arrogant of strength, exclaims, âI am a Lordâby nature I am noble: These fields are mine, for I was born to them, I was born in the castleâyou, poor wretches, Whelp'd in the cottage are by birth my slaves.â Almighty God! such blasphemies are utter'd: Almighty God! such blasphemies believed! Tom Miller. This is something like a sermon. Jack Straw. Where's the bishop Would tell you truths like these? Hob. There never was a bishop among all the apostles. John Ball. My brethrenâ Piers. Silence; the good priest speaks. John Ball. My brethren, these are truths, and weighty ones, Ye are all equal: nature made ye so. Equality is your birthright.âWhen I gaze On the proud palace, and behold one man In the blood purpled robes of royalty, Feasting at ease, and lording over millions, Then turn me to the hut of poverty, And see the wretched labourer worn with toil, Divide his scanty morsel with his infants, I sicken, and indignant at the sight, âBlush for the patience of humanity.â Jack Straw. We will assert our rights. Tom Miller. We'll trample down These insolent oppressors. John Ball. In good truth, Ye have cause for anger: but, my honest friends, Is it revenge or justice that ye seek? Mob. Justice! Justice! John Ball. Oh, then remember mercy; And though your proud oppressors spare not you, Show you excel them in humanity. They will use every art to disunite you; To conquer separately, by stratagem, Whom in a mass they fear;âbut be ye firm; Boldly demand your long-forgotten rights, Your sacred, your inalienable freedom. Be boldâbe resoluteâbe merciful: And while you spurn the hated name of slaves, Show you are men. Mob. Long live our honest priest. Jack Straw. He shall be made archbishop. John Ball. My brethren, I am plain John Ball, your friend, Your equal: by the law of Christ enjoin'd To serve you, not command. Jack Straw. March we for London. Tyler. Mark me, my friendsâwe rise for Libertyâ Justice shall be our guide: let no man dare To plunder in the tumult. Mob. Lead us on. Liberty! Justice! [Exeunt, with cries of Liberty! No Poll-tax! No War. SCENE II. The Tower. King Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury, Sir John Tresilian, Walworth, Philpot. King. What must we do? the danger grows more imminent. The mob increases. Philpot. Every moment brings Fresh tidings of our peril. King. It were well To grant them what they ask. Archbishop. Aye, that my liege Were politic. Go boldly forth to meet them, Grant all they askâhowever wild and ruinousâ Meantime, the troops you have already summon'd Will gather round them. Then my Christian power Absolves you of your promise. Walworth. Were but their ringleaders cut off, the rabble Would soon disperse. Philpot. United in a mass, There's nothing can resist themâonce divide them And they will fall an easy sacrifice. Archbishop. Lull them by promisesâbespeak them fair. Go forth, my liegeâspare not, if need requires A solemn oath to ratify the treaty. King. I dread their fury. Archbishop. 'Tis a needless dread, There is divinity about your person; It is the sacred privilege of Kings, Howe'er they act, to render no account To man. The people have been taught this lesson, Nor can they soon forget it. King. I will goâ I will submit to everything they ask; My day of triumph will arrive at last. [Shouts without. Enter Messenger. Messenger. The mob are at the city gates. Archbishop. Haste! Haste! Address them ere too late. I'll remain here, For they detest me much. [Shouts again. Enter another Messenger. Mess. The Londoners have open'd the city gates; The rebels are admitted. King. Fear then must give me courage. My lord mayor, Come you with me. [Exeunt. Shouts without. SCENE III. Smithfield. Wat Tyler, John Ball, Piers, &amp;c. Mob. Piers. So far triumphant are we. How these nobles, These petty tyrants, who so long oppress'd us, Shrink at the first resistance. Hob. They were powerful Only because we fondly thought them so. Where is Jack Straw? Tyler. Jack Straw is gone to the Tower To seize the king, and so to end resistance. John Ball. It was well judged; fain would I spare the shedding Of human blood: gain we that royal puppet And all will follow fairly; deprived of him, The nobles lose their pretext, nor will dare Rebel against the people's majesty. Enter Herald. Herald. Richard the Second, by the grace of God, Of England, Ireland, France, and Scotland, King, And of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Would parley with Wat Tyler. Tyler. Let him know Wat Tyler is in Smithfield. [Exit Herald.]âI will parley With this young monarch: as he comes to me, Trusting my honour, on your lives I charge you Let none attempt to harm him. John Ball. The faith of courts Is but a weak dependence. You are honestâ And better is it even to die the victim Of credulous honesty, than live preserved By the cold policy that still suspects. Enter King, Walworth, Philpot, &amp;c. King. I would speak to thee, Wat Tyler: bid the mob Retire awhile. Piers. Nay, do not go aloneâ Let me attend you. Tyler. Wherefore should I fear? Am I not arm'd with a just cause? Retire, And I will boldly plead the cause of Freedom. [Advances. King. Tyler, why have you kill'd my officer, And led my honest subjects from their homes, Thus to rebel against the Lord's anointed? Tyler. Because they were oppress'd. King. Was this the way To remedy the ill? You should have tried By milder meansâpetition'd at the throneâ The throne will always listen to petitions. Tyler. King of England, Petitioning for pity is most weakâ The sovereign people ought to demand justice. I kill'd your officer, for his lewd hand Insulted a maid's modesty. Your subjects I lead to rebel against the Lord's anointed, Because his ministers have made him odious, His yoke is heavy, and his burden grievous. Why do we carry on this fatal war, To force upon the French a king they hate, Tearing our young men from their peaceful homes, Forcing his hard-earn'd fruits from the honest peasant, Distressing us to desolate our neighbours? Why is this ruinous poll-tax imposed, But to support your court's extravagance, And your mad title to the crown of France? Shall we sit tamely down beneath these evils Petitioning for pity? King of England, Why are we sold like cattle in your marketsâ Deprived of every privilege of man? Must we lie tamely at our tyrant's feet, And, like your spaniels, lick the hand that beats us? You sit at ease in your gay palaces, The costly banquet courts your appetite, Sweet music soothes your slumbers: we the while, Scarce by hard toil can earn a little food, And sleep scarce shelter'd from the cold night wind; Whilst your wild projects wrests the little from us Which might have cheer'd the wintry hour of age. The parliament for ever asks more money; We toil and sweat for money for your taxes: Where is the benefit, what good reap we From all the counsels of your government? Think you that we should quarrel with the French? What boots to us your victories, your glory: We pay, we fight, you profit at your ease. Do you not claim the country as your own? Do you not call the venison of the forest, The birds of heaven your own?âprohibiting us, Even though in want of food, to seize the prey Which nature offers. King! is all this just? Think you, we do not feel the wrongs we suffer? The hour of retribution is at hand, And tyrants trembleâmark me, King of England Walworth â (comes behind him, and stabs him.) Insolent rebel, threatening the King! Piers. Vengeance! Vengeance! Hob. Seize the King. King. I must be bold. (Advancing) My friends and loving subjects, I will grant you all you ask; you shall be freeâ The tax shall be repeal'dâall, all you wish. Your leader menaced me, he deserv'd his fate. Quiet your angers: on my royal word Your grievances shall all be done away; Your vassalage abolish'd. A free pardon Allow'd to all: So help me God, it shall be. John Ball. Revenge, my brethren, beseems not Christians: Send us these terms, sign'd with your seal of state. We will await in peace. Deceive us notâ Act justly, so to excuse your late foul deed. King. The charter shall be drawn out: on mine honour All shall be justly done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. Smithfield. John Ball, Piers, &amp;c. Piers. (to John Ball.) You look disturbed, my father. John Ball. Piers, I am so. Jack Straw has forced the Tower: seiz'd the Archbishop, And beheaded him. Piers. The curse of insurrection. John Ball. Aye, Piers, our nobles level down their vassals, Keep them at endless labour, like their brutes, Degrading every faculty by servitude, Repressing all the energy of mind: We must not wonder, then, that, like wild beasts, When they have burst their chains, with brutal rage They revenge them on their tyrants. Piers. This Archbishop, He was oppressive to his humble vassals: Proud, haughty, avariciousâ John Ball. A true high priest, Preaching humility with his mitre on; Praising up alms and Christian charity, Even whilst his unforgiving hand distress'd His honest tenants. Piers. He deserved his fate, then. John Ball. Justice can never link with cruelty. Is there among the catalogue of crimes A sin so black that only Death can expiate? Will Reason never rouse her from her slumbers, And darting through the veil her eagle eye, See in the sable garments of the law Revenge conceal'd? This high priest has been haughty, He has oppress'd his vassals: tell me, Piers, Does his death remedy the ills he caused? Were it not better to repress his power Of doing wrong, that so his future life Might remedy the evils of the past, And benefit mankind? Piers. But must not vice Be punish'd? John Ball. Is not punishment revenge? The momentary violence of anger May be excused: the indignant heart will throb Against oppression, and the outstretch'd arm Resent its injured feelings. The Collector Insulted Alice, and roused the keen emotions Of a fond father. Tyler murder'd him. Piers. Murder'd!âa most harsh word. John Ball. Yes, murder'd him: His mangled feelings prompted the bad act, And Nature will almost commend the deed That Justice blames: but will the awaken'd feelings Plead with their heart-emoving eloquence For the calm deliberate murder of Revenge? Would you, Piers, in your calmer hour of reason, Condemn an erring brother to be slain? Cut him at once from all the joys of life, All hopes of reformationâto revenge The deed his punishment cannot recall? My blood boil'd in me at the fate of Tyler, Yet I reveng'd not. Piers. Oh, my Christian father, They would not argue thus humanely on us, Were we within their power. John Ball. I know they would not; But we must pity them that they are vicious, Nor imitate their vice. Piers. Alas, poor Tyler! I do repent me much that I stood back, When he advanced, fearless in rectitude, To meet these royal assassins. John Ball. Not for myself, Though I have lost an honest virtuous friend, Mourn I the death of Tyler: he was one Gifted with the strong energy of mind, Quick to perceive the right, and prompt to act When Justice needed: he would listen to me With due attention, yet not yielding lightly What had to him seem'd good: severe in virtue, He awed the ruder people, whom he led, By his stern rectitude. Piers. Witness that day When they destroy'd the palace of the Gaunt; And hurl'd the wealth his avarice had amass'd, Amid the fire: the people, fierce in zeal, Threw in the flames a wretch whose selfish hand Purloin'd amid the tumult. John Ball. I lament The death of Tyler for my country's sake. I shudder lest posterity enslaved, Should rue his murder. Who shall now controul The giddy multitude, blind to their own good, And listening with avidity to the tale Of courtly falsehood. Piers. The King must perform His plighted promise. (Cry without.âThe Charter;âthe Charter.) Enter Mob and Herald. Tom Miller. Read it outâread it out. Hob. Aye, aye, let's hear the Charter. Herald. Richard Plantagenet, by the grace of God, King of England, Ireland, France, Scotland, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, to all whom it may concern,âThese presents: Whereas our loving subjects have complained to us of the heavy burdens they endure, particularly from our late enacted poll-tax; and whereas they have risen in arms against our officers, and demanded the abolition of personal slavery, vassalage and manorial rights; we, ever ready in our sovereign mercy to listen to the petitions of our loving subjects, do annul all these grievances. Mob. Huzza! long live the King. Herald (continues). And do of our royal mercy grant a free pardon to all who may have been anyways concerned in the late insurrections. All this shall be faithfully performed on our royal word, so help us God.âGod save the King. [Loud and repeated shouts. Herald. Now then depart in quiet to your homes. John Ball. Nay, my good friend, the people will remain Embodied peaceably, till parliament Confirm the royal Charter: tell your King so: We will await the Charter's confirmation, Meanwhile comporting ourselves orderly, As peaceful citizens, not risen in tumult, But to redress their evils. [Exit Herald, &amp;c. Hob. 'Twas well ordered. I place but little trust in courtly faith. John Ball. We must remain embodied; else the King Will plunge again in royal luxury, And when the storm of danger is past over, Forget his promises. Hob. Aye, like an aguish sinner, He'll promise to repent, when the fit's on him, When well recover'd, laugh at his own terrors. Piers. Oh I am grieved that we must gain so little. Why are not all these empty ranks abolish'd, King, slave, and lord, ennobled into MAN. Are we not equal all?âhave you not told me Equality is the sacred right of man, Inalienable, though by force withheld? John Ball. Even so: but, Piers, my frail and fallible judgement Knows hardly to decide if it be right, Peaceably to return, content with little, With this half restitution of our rights, Or boldly to proceed, through blood and slaughter, Till we should all be equal and all happy. I chose the milder way:âperhaps I err'd! Piers. I fear me! By the mass, the unsteady people Are flocking homewardsâhow the multitude Diminishes! John Ball. Go thou, my son, and stay them. Carter, do you exert your influence, All depends upon their stay: my mind is troubled, And I would fain compose my thoughts for action. [Exeunt Hob and Piers. Father of mercies! I do fear me much That I have err'd. Thou gavest my ardent mind To pierce the mists of superstitious falsehood;â Gavest me to know the truth. I should have urged it Through every opposition; now, perhaps, The seemly voice of pity has deceived me And all this mighty movement ends in ruin. I fear me I have been like the weak leech, Who, sparing to cut deep, with cruel mercy Mangles his patient without curing him. [Great tumult. What means this tumult? hark! the clang of arms. God of eternal justiceâthe false monarch Has broke his plighted vow. [Enter Piers wounded. Piers. Fly, fly, my fatherâthe perjured King,âfly, fly. John Ball. Nay, nay, my child; I dare abide my fate. Let me bind up thy wounds. Piers. 'Tis useless succour. They seek thy life; fly, fly, my honoured father, And let me have the hope to sweeten death That thou at least hast 'scaped. They are murdering Our unsuspecting brethren: half unarm'd, Trusting too fondly to the tyrant's word, They were dispersing:âthe streets swim with blood. Oh, save thyself. [Enter soldiers. 1st Soldier. This is that old seditious heretic. 2d Soldier. And here the young spawn of rebellion; My orders ar'n't to spare him. [Stabs Piers. Come, you old stirrer-up of insurrection, You bell-wether of the mobâyou ar'n't to die So easily. [Leading him off. (Mob fly across the stageâthe troops pursue themâ tumult increasesâloud cries and shouts. SCENE II. Westminster Hall. King, Walworth, Philpot, Sir John Tresilian, &amp;c. Walworth. My liege, 'twas wisely ordered, to destroy The dunghill rabble, but take prisoner That old seditious priest: his strange wild notions Of this equality, when well exposed, Will create ridicule, and shame the people Of their late tumults. Sir John. Aye, there's nothing like A fair, free, open trial, where the King Can choose his jury and appoint his judges. King. Walworth, I must thank you for my deliverance, 'Twas a bold deed to stab him in the parley. Kneel down, and rise a knight, Sir William Walworth. Enter Messenger. Messenger. I left them hotly at it. Smithfield smoked With the rebels' blood! your troops fought loyally, There's not a man of them will lend an ear To pity. Walworth. Is John Ball secured? Messanger. They have seized him. Enter Guards, with John Ball. 1st Guard. We've brought the old villain. 2d Guard. An old mischief makerâ Why there's fifteen hundred of the mob are killed, All through his preaching. Sir John Tr. Prisoner, are you the arch-rebel John Ball? John Ball. I am John Ball; but I am not a rebel. Take ye the name, who, arrogant in strength, Rebel against the people's sovereignty. Sir John Tr. John Ball, you are accused of stirring up The poor deluded people to rebellion; Not having the fear of God and of the King Before your eyes; of preaching up strange notions, Heretical and treasonous; such as saying That kings have not a right from Heaven to govern; That all mankind are equal; and that rank. And the distinctions of society, Aye, and the sacred rights of property, Are evil and oppressive; plead you guilty To this most heavy charge? John Ball. If it be guilt, To preach what you are pleased to call strange notions, That all mankind as brethren must be equal; That privileged orders of society Are evil and oppressive; that the right Of property is a juggle to deceive The poor whom you oppress; I plead me guilty. Sir John Tr. It is against the custom of this court That the prisoner should plead guilty. John Ball. Why then put you The needless question? Sir Judge, let me save The vain and empty insult of a trial. What I have done, that I dare justify. Sir John Tr. Did you not tell the mob they were oppress'd; And preach upon the equality of man; With evil intent thereby to stir them up To tumult and rebellion? John Ball. That I told them That all mankind are equal, is most true: Ye came as helpless infants to the world; Ye feel alike the infirmities of nature; And at last moulder into common clay. Why then these vain distinctions?âbears not the earth Food in abundance?âmust your granaries O'erflow with plenty, while the poor man starves? Sir Judge, why sit you there, clad in your furs; Why are your cellars stored with choicest wines? Your larders hung with dainties, while your vassal, As virtuous, and as able too by nature, Though by your selfish tyranny deprived Of mind's improvement, shivers in his rags, And starves amid the plenty he creates. I have said this is wrong, and I repeat itâ And there will be a time when this great truth Shall be confess'dâbe felt by all mankind. The electric truth shall run from man to man, And the blood-cemented pyramid of greatness Shall fall before the flash. Sir John Tr. Audacious rebel; How darest thou insult this sacred court, Blaspheming all the dignities of rank? How could the Government be carried on Without the sacred orders of the King And the nobility. John Ball. Tell me, Sir Judge, What does the Government avail the peasant? Would not he plough his field, and sow the corn, Aye, and in peace enjoy the harvest too? Would not the sun shine and the dews descend, Though neither King nor Parliament existed? Do your court politics ought matter him? Would he be warring even unto death With his French neighbours? Charles and Richard contend, The people fight and suffer:âthink ye, Sirs, If neither country had been cursed with a chief, The peasants would have quarrell'd? King. This is treason! The patience of the court has been insultedâ Condemn the foul-mouth'd, contumacious rebel. Sir John Tr. John Ball, whereas you are accused before us, Of stirring up the people to rebellion, And preaching to them strange and dangerous doctrines; And whereas your behaviour to the court Has been most insolent and contumacious; Insulting Majestyâand since you have pleaded Guilty to all these charges; I condemn you To death: you shall be hanged by the neck, But not till you are deadâyour bowels open'dâ Your heart torn out, and burnt before your faceâ Your traitorous head be severed from your bodyâ Your body quarter'd, and exposed upon The city gatesâa terrible exampleâ And the Lord God have mercy on your soul. John Ball. Why, be it so. I can smile at your vengeance, For I am arm'd with rectitude of soul. The truth, which all my life I have divulged, And am now doom'd in torments to expire for, Shall still survive. The destined hour must come, When it shall blaze with sun-surpassing splendour, And the dark mists of prejudice and falsehood Fade in its strong effulgence. Flattery's incense No more shall shadow round the gore-dyed throne; That altar of oppression, fed with rites, More savage than the priests of Moloch taught, Shall be consumed amid the fire of Justice; The rays of truth shall emanate around, And the whole world be lighted. King. Drag him hence: Away with him to death; order the troops Now to give quarter, and make prisonersâ Let the blood-reeking sword of war be sheathed, That the law may take vengeance on the rebels.</field>
