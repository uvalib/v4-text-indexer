      <field name="fulltext">All the Books of the Bible are either most admirable and exalted Pieces of Poetry, or are the best materials in the world for it. Cowley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF BEAUFORT; THESE SACRED DRAMAS ARE, WITH THE MOST PERFECT RESPECT, INSCRIBED: AS, AMONG THE MANY AMIABLE AND DISTINGUISHED QUALITIES WHICH ADORN HER MIND, AND ADD LUSTRE TO HER RANK, HER EXCELLENCE IN THE MATERNAL CHARACTER GIVES A PECULIAR PROPRIETY TO HER PROTECTION OF THIS LITTLE WORK; WRITTEN WITH AN HUMBLE WISH TO PROMOTE THE LOVE OF PIETY AND VIRTUE IN YOUNG PERSONS; BY HER GRACE'S MOST OBEDIENT, MOST OBLIGED, AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT, H. MORE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE INTRODUCTION. O for the sacred energy which struck The harp of Jesse's son! or for a spark Of that celestial flame which touch'd the lips Of bless'd Isaiah Isaiah, chap. vi. when the Seraphim With living fire descended, and his soul From sin's pollution purg'd! or one faint ray, (If human things to heavenly I may join) Of that pure spirit which inflam'd the breast Of Milton, God's own poet! when, retir'd, In fair enthusiastic vision rapt, The nightly visitant deign'd bless his couch With inspiration, such as never flow'd From Aganippe's fount, or Acidale: Then, when the sacred fire within him burnt, He spake, as man or angel might have spoke, When man was pure, and Angels were his guests. It will not be.âNor prophet's burning zeal; Nor muse of fire, nor yet to sweep the strings With sacred energy to me belongs; Nor with Miltonic hand to touch the chords That wake to ecstacy. From me, alas! The secret source of harmony is hid; The magic powers which catch the ravish'd soul In melody's sweet maze, and the clear streams Which to pure Fancy's yet untasted springs Enchanted lead. Of these I nothing know; Yet, all unknowing, dare invoke thy aid, Spirit of Truth! who graciously hast said, That none who ask in faith should ask in vain. You I invoke not now, ye fabled nine! I not invoke you, though you well were sought In Greece and Latium, by immortal bards, Whose syren song enchants, and shall enchant, Thro' Time's wide-circling round, tho' false their faith, And less than human were the gods they sung. Tho' false their faith, they taught the best they knew, And, blush O Christians! liv'd above their faith. They wou'd have bless'd the beam, and hail'd the day, Which chas'd the moral darkness from their souls. Oh! had their minds receiv'd the clearer ray Of true devotion, they had learn'd to scorn Their deities impure, their senseless gods, And wild mythology's fantastic maze. Pure Plato! how had thy chaste spirit hail'd A faith so fitted to thy moral sense! What hadst thou felt to see the fair romance Of high imagination, the bright dream Of thy pure fancy more than realiz'd! O sweet enthusiast! thou hadst blest a scheme Fair, good, and perfect. How had thy rapt soul, Caught fire, and burnt with a diviner flame! For ev'n thy fair idea ne'er conceiv'd Such plenitude of love, such boundless bliss, As Deity made visible to sense. Unhappy Brutus! philosophic mind! Great 'midst the errors of the Stoic school! How had his kindling spirit joy'd to find That his lov'd virtue was no empty name; Nor had he met the vision at Philippi, Nor had he sheath'd his bloody dagger's point, Or in the breast he lov'd, or in his own. The Pagan page how far more wise than ours! They with the gods they worshipp'd grac'd their song; Our song we grace with gods we disbelieve; The manners we adopt without the creed. Shall Fiction only raise poetic flame, And shall no altars blaze, O Truth! to thee? Shall falsehood only please, and fable charm? And shall eternal Truth neglected lie? Because immortal, slighted or profan'd? Truth has our rev'rence only, not our love; Our praise, but not our heart. A deity, Confess'd, but shunn'd, acknowledg'd, not ador'd: She comes too near us, and she shines too bright. Her penetrating beam at once betrays What we wou'd hide from others and ourselves. Why shun to make our duty our delight? Let pleasure be the motive (and allow That immortality be quite forgot): Where shall we trace thro' all the page profane, A livelier pleasure, and a purer source Of innocent delight, than the fair book Of holy Truth presents? For ardent youth, The sprightly narrative; for years mature, The moral document, in sober robe Of grave philosophy array'd; which all Had heard with admiration, had embrac'd With rapture; had the shades of Academe, Or the learn'd Porch produc'd it. Then, O then, How Wisdom's hidden treasures had been couch'd Beneath fair Allegory's graceful veil! Do not the pow'rs of soul-enchanting song, Strong imag'ry, bold figure, every charm Of eastern flight sublime, apt metaphor, And all the graces in thy lovely train, Divine Simplicity! assemble all In Sion's songs, and bold Isaiah's strain? Why shou'd the classic eye delight to trace How Pyrrha and the fam'd Thessalian Deucalion. king Restor'd the ruin'd race of lost mankind; Yet turn, incurious, from the patriarch sav'd, The righteous remnant of a delug'd world? Why are we taught, delighted, to recount Alcides' labours, yet neglect to learn How mighty Sampson led a life of toil Herculean? Pain and peril mark'd them both; A life eventful, and disastrous death. Can all the tales which Grecian records yield; Can all the names the Roman page records, Renown'd for friendship and surpassing love; Can gallant Theseus and his brave compeer; Orestes, and the partner of his toils; Achates and his friend; Euryalus And blooming Nisus, pleasant in their lives, And undivided by the stroke of death; Can each, can all, a lovelier picture yield Of virtuous friendship; can they all present A tenderness more touching than the love Of Jonathan and David?âSpeak, ye young! You who are undebauch'd by fashion's lore, And, unsophisticate, from nature judge, Say, is your quick attention stronger drawn, By wasted Thebes, than Pharaoh's smitten hosts? Or do the vagrant Trojans yield a theme More grateful to the eager appetite Of young impatience, than the wand'ring tribes, By Moses thro' the thirsty desert led? The beauteous Iphigenia. Maid (tho' tender is the tale), Whose guiltless blood on Aulis' altars stream'd, Smites not the bosom with a softer pang Than Jephthah's daughter, doom'd like her to die. Such are the lovely themes which court the muse! Scarce yet essay'd in verse. O let me mourn That heav'n-descended song shou'd e'er forget Its sacred dignity and high descent; Shou'd e'er so far its origin debase, To spread corruption's bane, to lull the bad With flattery's opiate strain; to taint the heart Of innocence, and silently infuse Delicious poison, whose insidious charm Feeds the sick mind, and fondly ministers Unwholesome pleasure to the fever'd taste; While its fell venom, with malignant pow'r, Strikes at the root of virtue, with'ring all Her vital energy. Oh! for some balm Of sov'reign pow'r to raise the drooping muse To all the health of virtue! to infuse A gen'rous warmth, to rouse an holy pride, And give her high conceptions of herself! For me, eternal Spirit! let thy word My path illume! O thou compassionate God! Thou know'st our frame, thou know'st we are but dust. From dust a Seraph's zeal thou wilt not ask, An Angel's purity. Oh! as I strive, Tho' with a feeble voice and flagging wing, A glowing heart, but pow'rless hand, to tell The faith of favour'd man to heav'n; to trace The ways inscrutable of heav'n to man; May I, by thy celestial guidance led, Fix deeper in my heart the truths I sing! In my own life transcribe whate'er of good To others I propose! and by thy rule Correct th' irregular What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support. Paradise Lost., reform the wrong, Exalt the low, and brighten the obscure! Still may I note how all th' agreeing parts Of this well-order'd fabric, join to frame One fair, one finish'd, one harmonious whole! Trace the close links which form the perfect chain In beautiful connexion; mark the scale, Whose nice gradations, with progression true, For ever rising, end in Deity!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The subject is taken from the Second Chapter of the Book of Exodus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. JOCHÃBED, MIRIAM. JOCHÃBED. Why was my pray'r accepted? why did heav'n In anger hear me when I ask'd a son? Ye dames of Egypt! happy, happy mothers! No tyrant robs you of your fondest hopes; You are not doom'd to see the babes you bore, The babes you nurture bleed before your eyes! You taste the transports of maternal love, And never know its anguish! Happy mothers! How diff'rent is the lot of thy sad daughters, O wretched Israel! Was it then for this? Was it for this the righteous arm of God Rescued his chosen people from the jaws Of cruel want, by pious Joseph's care? Joseph! th' elected instrument of heav'n, Decreed to save illustrious Abraham's race, What time the famine rag'd in Canaan's land. Israel, who then was spar'd, must perish now! Oh thou mysterious pow'r! who hast involv'd Thy wise decrees in darkness, to perplex The pride of human wisdom, to confound The daring scrutiny, and prove the faith Of thy presuming creatures! clear this doubt; Teach me to trace this maze of Providence: Why save the fathers if the sons must perish? MIRIAM. Ah me, my mother! whence these floods of grief? JOCHÃBED. My son! my son! I cannot speak the rest. Ye who have sons can only know my fondness! Ye who have lost them, or who fear to lose, Can only know my pangs! none else can guess them. A mother's sorrows cannot be conceiv'd But by a motherâWherefore am I one? MIRIAM. With many pray'rs thou didst request this son, And heav'n has granted him. JOCHÃBED. O sad estate Of human wretchedness! so weak is man, So ignorant and blind, that did not God Sometimes withhold in mercy what we ask, We shou'd be ruin'd at our own request. Too well thou know'st, my child, the stern decree, Of Egypt's cruel king, hard-hearted Pharaoh; âThat ev'ry male, of Hebrew mother born, âMust die.â Oh! do I live to tell it thee? Must die a bloody death! My child, my son, My youngest born, my darling must be slain! MIRIAM. The helpless innocent! and must he die? JOCHÃBED. No: if a mother's tears, a mother's pray'rs, A mother's fond precautions can prevail, He shall not die. I have a thought, my Miriam! And sure the God of mercies who inspir'd, Will bless the secret purpose of my soul, To save his precious life. MIRIAM. Hop'st thou that Pharaohâ JOCHÃBED. I have no hope in Pharaoh, much in God; Much in the Rock of Ages. MIRIAM. Think, O think, What perils thou already hast incurr'd, And shun the greater which may yet remain. Three months, three dang'rous months thou hast preserv'd Thy infant's life, and in thy house conceal'd him! Shou'd Pharaoh know! JOCHÃBED. Oh! let the tyrant know, And feel what he inflicts! Yes, hear me, Heav'n! Send thy right aiming thunderboltsâBut hush, My impious murmurs! Is it not thy will; Thou, infinite in mercy? Thou permitt'st This seeming evil for some latent good. Yes, I will laud thy grace, and bless thy goodness For what I have, and not arraign thy wisdom For what I fear to lose. Oh, I will bless thee, That Aaron will be spar'd! that my first-born Lives safe and undisturb'd! that he was giv'n me Before this impious persecution rag'd! MIRIAM. And yet who knows but the fell tyrant's rage May reach his precious life? JOCHÃBED. I fear for him, For thee, for all. A doating parent lives In many lives; thro' many a nerve she feels; From child to child the quick affections spread, For ever wand'ring, yet for ever fix'd. Nor does division weaken, nor the force Of constant operation e'er exhaust Parental love. All other passions change With changing circumstances; rise or fall, Dependant on their object; claim returns; Live on reciprocation, and expire Unfed by hope. A mother's fondness reigns Without a rival, and without an end. MIRIAM. But say what Heav'n inspires to save thy son? JOCHÃBED. Since the dear fatal morn which gave him birth, I have revolv'd in my distracted mind Each means to save his life: and many a thought Which fondness prompted, prudence has oppos'd As perilous and rash. With these poor hands I've fram'd a little ark of slender reeds; With pitch and slime I have secur'd the sides. In this frail cradle I intend to lay My little helpless infant, and expose him Upon the banks of Nile. MIRIAM. 'Tis full of danger. JOCHÃBED. 'Tis danger to expose, and death to keep him. MIRIAM. Yet, Oh! reflect. Shou'd the fierce crocodile, The native and the tyrant of the Nile, Seize the defenceless infant! JOCHÃBED. Oh, forbear! Spare my fond heart. Yet not the crocodile, Nor all the deadly monsters of the deep, To me are half so terrible as Pharaoh, That heathen king, that royal murderer! MIRIAM. Shou'd he escape, which yet I dare not hope, Each sea-born monster, yet the winds and waves He cannot 'scape. JOCHÃBED. Know, God is ev'ry where; Not to one narrow, partial spot confin'd; No, not to chosen Israel: He extends Thro' all the vast infinitude of space. At his command the furious tempests rise, The blasting of the breath of his displeasure: He tells the world of waters when to roar; And at his bidding, winds and seas are calm. In HIM, not in an arm of flesh, I trust; In HIM, whose promise never yet has fail'd, I place my confidence. MIRIAM. What must I do? Command thy daughter, for thy words have wak'd An holy boldness in my youthful breast. JOCHÃBED. Go then, my Miriam! go, and take the infant. Buried in harmless slumbers there he lies: Let me not see himâspare my heart that pang. Yet sure, one little look may be indulg'd, One kissâperhaps the last. No more, my soul! That fondness wou'd be fatalâI shou'd keep him. I cou'd not doom to death the babe I clasp'd: Did ever mother kill her sleeping boy? I dare not hazard itâThe task be thine. Oh! do not wake my child; remove him softly; And gently lay him on the river's brink. MIRIAM. Did those magicians, whom the sons of Egypt Consult, and think all potent, join their skill, And was it great as Egypt's sons believe; Yet all their secret wizard arts combin'd, To save this little ark of Bulrushes, Thus fearfully expos'd, cou'd not effect it. Their spells, their incantations, and dire charms Cou'd not preserve it. JOCHÃBED. Know this ark is charm'd With spells, which impious Egypt never knew. With invocations to the living God I twisted every slender reed together, And with a pray'r did every ozier weave. MIRIAM. I go. JOCHÃBED. Yet e'er thou go'st, observe me well. When thou hast laid him in his watry bed, O leave him not; but at a distance wait And mark what Heaven's high will determines for him. Lay him among the flags on yonder beach, Just where the royal gardens meet the Nile. I dare not follow him, Suspicion's eye Wou'd note my wild demeanor; Miriam, yes, The mother's fondness wou'd betray the child. Farewell! God of my fathers, oh protect him!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE, The Banks of the Nile. Enter MIRIAM, after having deposited the child. Yes, I have laid him in his watry bed, His watry grave, I fear!âI tremble still; It was a cruel taskâstill I must weep! But ah! my mother, who shall sooth thy griefs? The flags and sea-weed will awhile sustain Their precious load, but it must sink e'er long! Sweet babe, farewell! Yet think not I will leave thee; No, I will watch thee till the greedy waves Devour thy little bark: I'll sit me down, And sing to thee, sweet babe! Thou can'st not hear, But 'twill amuse me while I watch thy fate. [She sits down on a bank and sings. SONG. I. Thou, who canst make the feeble strong, O God of Israel, hear my song! Not mine such notes as Egypt's daughters raise, 'Tis thee, O God of Hosts, I strive to praise. II. Ye winds, the servants of the Lord, Ye waves, obedient to his word, O spare the babe committed to your trust, And Israel shall confess the Lord is just! III. Tho' doom'd to find an early grave, This helpless infant thou canst save; And he whose death is doom'd by Pharaoh's hand, May rise a prophet to redeem the land. [She rises, and looks out. Who moves this way? of royal port she seems; Perhaps sent hither by the hand of Heav'n, To prop the falling house of Levi.âSoft! I'll listen unperceiv'd, these trees will hide me. [She stands behind. Enter the PRINCESS of Egypt, attended by a train of Ladies. PRINCESS. No farther, Virgins; here I mean to rest, To taste the pleasant coolness of the breeze, Perhaps to bathe in this translucent stream. Did not our holy law The ancient Egyptians used to wash their bodies four times every twenty-four hours. enjoin th' ablution Frequent and regular; it still were needful, To mitigate the fervors of our clime. Ianthe, stayâthe rest at distance wait. [They all go out, except one. The PRINCESS looks out. Sure, or I much mistake, or I perceive Upon the sedgy margin of the Nile A chest; entangled in the reeds it seems; Discern'st thou ought? IANTHE. Something, but what I know not. PRINCESS. Go and examine, what this sight may mean. [Exit maid. MIRIAM , behind. O blest, beyond my hopes! he is discover'd; My brother will be sav'd! who is this stranger? Ah! 'tis the Princess, cruel Pharaoh's daughter. If she resemble her inhuman Sire, She must be cruel too; yet fame reports her Most merciful and mild:âI'll mark th' event, And pray that Heav'n may prompt her to preserve him. Re-enter IANTHE. PRINCESS. Hast thou discover'd what the vessel is? IANTHE. Oh, Princess, I have seen the strangest sight! Within the vessel lies a sleeping babe, A fairer infant have I never seen! PRINCESS. Who knows, but some unhappy Hebrew woman Has thus expos'd her infant, to evade The stern decree of my too cruel Sire. Unhappy mothers! oft my heart has bled In secret anguish o'er your slaughter'd sons. IANTHE. Shou'd this be one my Princess knows the danger. PRINCESS. No danger shou'd deter from acts of mercy. MIRIAM , behind. A thousand blessings on her princely head! PRINCESS. Too much the sons of Jacob have endur'd From royal Pharaoh's unrelenting hate; Too much our house has crush'd their alien race. Is't not enough, that cruel task-masters Grind them by hard oppression and stern bondage? Is't not enough, my father owes his greatness, His palaces, his fanes magnificent; Those structures which the world with wonder views, To the hard toils of much insulted Israel? To them his growing cities owe their splendor, Their labours built fair Rameses and Pythom; And now, at length, his still increasing rage, To iron bondage adds the guilt of murder. And shall this little helpless infant perish? Forbid it justice, and forbid it, heav'n! IANTHE. I know, thy royal father fears the strength Of this still growing race, who flourish more The more they are oppress'd; he dreads their numbers. PRINCESS. Apis forbid! Pharaoh afraid of Israel! Yet shou'd this outcast race, this hapless people E'er grow to such a formidable greatness; (Which all the gods avert, whom Egypt worships), This infant's life can never serve their cause, Nor can this single death prevent their greatness. IANTHE. I know not that: by weakest instruments Sometimes are great events produc'd; this child Perhaps may live to serve his upstart race More than an host. PRINCESS. How ill does it beseem Thy tender years, and gentle womanhood To steel thy breast to Pity's sacred touch! So weak, so unprotected is our sex, So constantly expos'd, so very helpless, That did not Heav'n itself enjoin compassion, Yet human policy shou'd make us kind, Lest we shou'd need the pity we refuse. Yes, I will save himâlead me to the place; And from the feeble rushes we'll remove The little ark, which cradles this poor babe. [The Princess and maid go out. MIRIAM comes forward. How poor were words, to speak my boundless joy! The Princess will protect him; bless her, Heav'n! [She looks out after the Princess, and describes her action. With what impatient steps she seeks the shore! Now she approaches where the ark is laid! With what compassion, with what angel-sweetness, She bends to look upon the infant's face! She takes his little hand in her'sâhe wakesâ She smiles upon himâhark! alas, he cries; Weep on, sweet babe! weep on, till thou hast touch'd Each chord of pity, waken'd every sense Of melting sympathy, and stolen her soul. She takes him in her armsâO lovely Princess! How goodness heightens beauty! now she clasps him With fondness to her heart, she gives him now With tender caution to her damsel's arms: She points her to the palace, and again This way the Princess bends her gracious steps; The virgin-train retire, and bear the child. Re-enter the PRINCESS. PRINCESS. Did ever innocence and infant-beauty Plead with such dumb but powerful eloquence? If I, a stranger, feel these soft emotions, What must the mother who expos'd him feel! Go, fetch a woman of the Hebrew race, That she may nurse the babe; and, by her garb, Lo such a one is here! MIRIAM. Princess, all hail! Forgive the bold intrusion of thy servant, Who stands a charm'd spectator of thy goodness. PRINCESS. I have redeem'd an infant from the waves, Whom I intend to nurture as mine own. MIRIAM. My transports will betray me! [Aside.] Gen'rous Princess! PRINCESS. Know'st thou a matron of the Hebrew race, To whom I may confide him? MIRIAM. Well I know A prudent matron of the house of Levi, Her name JochÃ¨bed is, the wife of Amram; Gentle she is, and fam'd throughout her tribe For soft humanity; full well I know That she will rear him with a mother's love. [Aside.] Oh truly spoke! a mother's love indeed! To her despairing arms I mean to give This precious trust; the nurse shall be the mother! PRINCESS. With speed conduct this matron to the palace. Yes, I will raise him up to princely greatness, And he shall be my son; his name be Moses, For I have drawn him from the perilous flood. [They go out. She kneels. Thou Great Unseen! who causest gentle deeds, And smil'st on what thou causest; thus I bless thee, That thou didst deign consult the tender make Of yielding human hearts, when thou ordain'd'st Humanity a virtue! Did'st incline The nat'ral bias of the soul to mercy, Then mad'st that mercy duty! Gracious Pow'r! Mad'st the keen rapture exquisite as right: Beyond the joys of sense; as pleasure sweet; As reason constant, and as instinct strong!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. Enter JOCHÃBED. I've almost reach'd the placeâwith cautious steps I must approach to where the ark is laid, Lest from the royal gardens any spy me. âPoor babe! e'er this the pressing calls of hunger Have broke thy short repose; the chilling waves, Perhaps, have drench'd thy little shiv'ring limbs. Whatâwhat must he have suffer'd!âNo one sees me: But soft, does no one listen?âAh! how hard, How very hard for fondness to be prudent! Now is the moment, to embrace and feed him. [She looks out. Where's Miriam? she has left her little charge, Perhaps through fear, perhaps she was detected. How wild is thought! how terrible conjecture! A mother's fondness frames a thousand fears, And shapes unreal evils into being. [She looks towards the river. Ah me! where is he? soul-distracting sight! He is not thereâhe's lost, he's gone, he's drown'd! Toss'd by each beating surge my infant floats; Cold, cold and wat'ry is thy grave, my child! O noâI see the arkâTransporting sight! [She goes towards it What do I see? Alas, the ark is empty! The casket's left, the precious gem is gone! You spar'd him, pitying spirits of the deep! But vain your mercy; some insatiate beast, Cruel as Pharaoh, took the life you spar'dâ And I shall never, never see him more! Enter MIRIAM. JOCHÃBED. Come, and lament with me thy brother's loss! MIRIAM. Come, and adore with me the God of Jacob! JOCHÃBED. Miriamâthe child is dead! MIRIAM. He lives, he lives! JOCHÃBED. Impossible: Oh! do not mock my grief! See'st thou that empty vessel? MIRIAM. From that vessel Th' Egyptian Princess took him. JOCHÃBED. Pharaoh's daughter? Then still he will be slain. MIRIAM. His life is safe, For know, she means to rear him as her own. JOCHÃBED. [Falls on her knees in rapture. To God the Lord, the glory be ascrib'd! Oh magnified for ever be thy might, Who can'st plant mercy in a Heathen's heart, And from the depth of evil bring forth good! [She rises. MIRIAM. O blest event, beyond our warmest hopes! JOCHÃBED. What! shall my son be nurtur'd in a court, In princely grandeur bred? taught every art, And every wond'rous science Egypt knows? Yet ah! I tremble, Miriam; shou'd he learn, With Egypt's polish'd arts, her baneful faith! O worse exchange for death! Yes, shou'd he learn In yon' proud palace to disown his hand Who thus has sav'd him: shou'd he e'er embrace, (As sure he will, if bred in Pharaoh's court) The gross idolatries which Egypt owns, Her graven images, her brutish gods: Then shall I wish he had not been preserv'd, To shame his fathers, and deny his faith. MIRIAM. Then, to dispel thy fears, and crown thy joy, Hear father wondersâKnow, the gen'rous Princess To thy own care thy darling child commits. JOCHÃBED. Speak, while my joy will give me leave to listen! MIRIAM. By her commission'd, thou behold'st me here, To seek a matron of the Hebrew race To nurse him; thou, my mother, art that matron.â I said, I knew thee well; that thou woud'st rear him Ev'n with a mother's fondness; she who bare him (I told the Princess) could not love him more. JOCHÃBED. Fountain of Mercy! whose pervading eye Beholds the heart, and sees what passes there, Accept my thoughts for thanks! I have no wordsâ How poor were human language to express My gratitude, my wonder, and my joy! MIRIAM. Yes, thou shalt pour into his infant mind The purest precepts of the purest faith. JOCHÃBED. O! I will fill his tender soul with virtue, And warm his bosom with devotion's flame! Aid me, celestial spirit! with thy grace, And be my labours with thy influence crown'd: Without it they were vain. Then, then, my Miriam, When he is furnish'd, 'gainst the evil day, With God's whole armour 2 Thess. chap. v. Also, Ephes. chap. vi., girt with sacred truth, And as a breast-plate, wearing righteousness, Arm'd with the spirit of God, the shield of Faith, And with the helmet of salvation crown'd, Inur'd to watching and dispos'd to pray'r; Then may I send him to a dangerous court, And safely trust him in a perilous world, Too full of tempting snares and fond delusions! MIRIAM. May bounteous Heav'n thy pious cares reward! JOCHÃBED. O Amram! O my husband! when thou com'st, Wearied at night, to rest thee from the toils Impos'd by haughty Pharaoh; what a tale Have I to tell thee! yesâthy darling son Was lost and is restor'd; was dead and lives! MIRIAM. How joyful shall we spend the live-long night In praises to Jehovah; who thus mocks All human foresight, and converts the means Of seeming ruin into great deliverance! JOCHÃBED. Had not my child been doom'd to such strange perils, As a fond mother trembles to recal; He had not been preserv'd. MIRIAM. And mark still farther: Had he been sav'd by any other hand, He had been still expos'd to equal ruin. JOCHÃBED. Then let us join to bless the hand of Heaven, That this poor outcast of the house of Israel, Condemn'd to die by Pharaoh, kept in secret By my advent'rous fondness; then expos'd Ev'n by that very fondness which preserv'd him, Is now, to fill the wondrous round of mercy, Preserv'd from perishing by Pharaoh's daughter, Sav'd by the very hand which sought to crush him! Wise and unsearchable are all thy ways, Thou God of Mercies!âLead me to my child!</field>
