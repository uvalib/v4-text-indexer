      <field name="fulltext">THE MASKE OF FLOWERS. PRESENTED By the Gentlemen of Graies-Inne, at the Court of White-hall, in the Banquetting House, vpon Twelfe night, 1613. Being the last of the Solemnities and Magnificences which were performed at the marriage of the right honourable the Earle of Somerset, and the Lady Francis daughter of the Earle of Suffolke, Lord Chamberlaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE VERIE HONORABLE Knight, Sir Francis Bacon, his Maiesties Attorney generall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Deuice of the Maske The Sunne willing to doe honour to a Marriage, betweene two noble persons of the greatest Island of his vniuersall Empire, writeth his Letter of Commission to the two Seasons of the yeare, the Winter and the Spring, to visite and present them on his part, directing the Winter to present them with sports, such as are commonly called by the name of Christmasse sportes, or Carnaual sportes, and the Spring, with other sportes of more Magnificence. And more especially, that Winter for his part take knowledge of a certaine Challenge which had beene lately sent and accepted betweene Silenus and Kanasha vpon this point; That Wine was more woorthy then Tobacco, and did more cheere and relieue the spirits of man. This to be tried at two weapons, at Song and at Dance, and requiring the Winter to giue order that the same Challenge be performed in the dayes of Solemnitie of the same Marriage. The same Letter containeth a second Speciall direction to the Spring, that whereas of ancient time certaine beautifull youths had bin transformed from Men to Flowers, and had so continued till this time, that now they should be returned againe into Men, and present themselues in Maske at the same Marriage. All this is accordingly performed, and first the two Seasons Inuierno and Primauera come in, and receiue their dispatch from the Sunne, by Gallus the Sunnes Messenger: Thereupon Winter brings in the Challenge, consisting of two Anticke-Maskes, the Anticke-Maske of the Song, and the Anticke-Maske of the Dance. Then the Spring brings in the Maske it selfe, and there is first seene in the fabrique, a faire Garden vpon a descending Ground, and at the height thereof there is a stately long Arbour or Bower arched vppon Pillars, wherein the Maskers are placed, but are not discouered at the first, but there appeare onely certaine great tufts of flowers betwixt the Collumnes. Those flowers vpon the Charme doe vanish, and so the Maskers appeare euery one in the space or intercolumne of his Arch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Maske. At the entrance of the King, at the lower end of the Banquetting house, appeared a Trauers painted in Perspectiue, like the wall of a Cittie, with battlements, ouer which were seene the Tops of houses. In the middle whereof was a great gate, and on either side a Temple, the one dedicated to Silenus, and the other to Kawasha, in either of which opened a little gate. Out of the great gate, in the middle of the Citty, entred Inuierno or Winter, attired like an old man, in a short gowne of silke shagge, like withered grasse all frosted and snowed ouer, and his Cappe, Gowne, Gamashes, and Mittins furred crimson, with long white haire and beard, hung with Icecicles, he marcheth vp to the middle of the Hall, and looks round about him. Inuierno. Why thus it should be; such a night as this Puts downe a thousand weary longsome dayes Of Somer, when a Sunne, and Moone, and Stars Are mette within the Pallace of a King, In seuerall glory shining each on other, With raies of comfort, and benigne Aspects When hearts are warme: tis for the seely birds To sacrifice their Pipes vnto the Spring, And let the Pilgrim blesse the Summers day, But Courts, and Youth, and Ladies needs must praise The Winters raine. While Inuierno was thus speaking, entreth the Spring or Primauera, attired like a Nymph, a high tire on her head, Antike with knottes of faire haire, and Cobweb Lawnes rising one aboue an other, garnished with Flowers to some height, and behinde, falling downe in a pendant: an vpper-body of cloth of siluer florie, naked necke, and breast, decked with Pearls: a kertle of yellow cloth of gold, brancht with leaues, a mantle of greene and siluer stuffe, cut out in leaues, white buskins tied with greene ribands, fringed with flowers. Shee ouertaking Inuierno, clappes him on the shoulder. Primauera. Well ouertaken Winter. Inuierno? Primauera? Inuierno. Whats that I see? why, how dare you approach? In Ianus month, D'ye meane to giue the lie To all the Almanackes that are come forth? As if they had not lide enough besides, Prouoke me not, flie hence you wanton gerle, Stay not one minute. Primauera. Good olde lad! I know you a merry one Within doores: bluster not, Ile choose thee for My Valentine, and tell thee tales and riddles These liuelong nights: Th'art euer borrowing Some dayes of me, then let this one day passe, Good frost-beard now. But stay, me thinks I see The Trumpet of the Sun, hee'l stint this strife. Gallus comes in Post, attired like a Post: in yellow damaske doublet and bases, the doublet close wings, cut like feathers, a Powch of carnation Sattin, wherein was his packet hung in a Bawdricke of the same, a paire of yellow bootes, spurres with one long pricke like a Cocke, a little Hatte of yellow Damaske, with a plume of red Feathers like a Crest. Inuierno. Gallus mine owne braue Bird! welcome in troth, Thou art no peeping creature that attends This gawdy wench, Thou wakest the feathered houres, And call'st to labour, Tell vs, whats the newes? Primauera. What, crest and spurre! welcome, thou com'st in time, Winter hath almost giu'n me the agew, faith He is so bitter, but thou shalt end our quarrell. Gallus. Seasons both, God saue you in your times, I know you both so well, as if I should Giue leaue for you to chirpe, and you to chat: How you make all things greene, And you make all things fat. Time would away: peace then, read this dispatch, For I must backe to my accustomed watch. Winter reades the Letter. The Letter superscribed: To our faithfull and neuer-fayling Quarter-waiters, Inuierno, and Primauera. Wee haue taken knowledge of a Marriage to bee solemized betweene two noble Persons, in the principall Island of our vniuersall Empire, vnto which we are pleased to doe honour, and thereupon haue directed our seueral Letters to you the Seasons of the yeare to visit, and present them on your part. To this purpose we would haue you Inuierno to present them with such sports as are commonly knowne by the name of Christmasse sports, or Carnaual sports: and you Primauera, with sports of a more delicate nature, either of you according to your qualitie. And for your better instruction and enablement towards the due execution of this your Commission, We require you Inuierno, That whereas we vnderstaad that Silenus hath lately sent a Challenge to Kawasha, vpon this point, to maintaine, That Wine is more woorthie then Tobacco, and cheereth mans spirit more, The same to be tried at two seuerall weapons, Song, and Dance; which Challenge the said Kawasha hath also accepted, you take order that the said Challenge be performed at this Marriage, taking your conuenient time. And we require you Primauera for your part, That whereas of auncient time there were certaine faire Youthes turned into Flowers, which haue so continued vntil this time, that you deale with Flora by vertue of this Commission, That they be now returned to Men, and present a Dance at this Marriage. Heereof faile you not. Giuen at our Pallace your Lord and Master, I, the Sunne. Postscript. We haue also directed our Letters to the Summer &amp; the Haruest, the one to present them with length of dayes, and the other with fruite, but those Letters come with the next dispatch. Antickemaske of the Song. Hereupon they depart all three, and presently entred Silenus at a litle gate on the right h?d, mounted vpon an artificiall Asse, which sometimes being taken with straine of the Musicke, did bow downe his eares, and listen with great attention, the trappings were of Iuie, attended by a Satyre for his Palfreueir, who led the Asse. At the same instant entred Kawasha, at the other little gate, riding vpon a Kowle-staffe, couered with a foote-cloth of pide stuffe, borne vpon two Indians shoulders attired like Floridans. Silenus an old fat man, attired in a crimson Sattin Doublet, without wings, collar, or skirts, a great panch, so as his Dublet, though drawne with a lace, would not meete together by a handfull, sleeues of cloth of Golde, bases and gamashaes of the same, a red swolne face, with a bunched nose, grey beard, bald head, pricke eares, and little hornes. Kawasha had on his head a Night-cap of red cloth of gold, close to his skull, tied vnder his chin, two holes cut in the toppe, out of which his eares appeared, hung with two great Pendants, on the crowne of his Cappe a Chimney, a glasse chaine about his necke, his body and legges of Oliue-colour stuffe, made close like the skinne, bases of Tobacco-colour stuffe cut like Tobacco leaues, sprinkled with orcedure, in his hand an Indian Bow and Arrowes. Before either of these went a Sergeant. The Sergeant of Silenus carried a copper Mace, and a bunch of Grapes carued at the vpper end. The Sergeant of Kawasha carried on his shoulder a great Tobacco Pipe, as bigge as a Caliuer. Before Silenus marched foure singers, and behind him fiue-fidlers: Before and behinde Kawasha as many of each kinde. The Singers on Silenus part were a Miller, a Wine Cooper, a Vintners boy, a Brewer. His musicke, a Taber and a Pipe, a base Violin, a trebble Violin a Sagbut, a Mandora. Kawashaes Singers, a Skipper, a Fencer, a Pedler, a Barber. His musicke, a Bobtaile, a blinde Harper, and his boy, a base Violin, a tenor-Cornet, a Sagbut. Vpon their entrance the Musicke on both sides played till they came to the middle of the Stage. Then Silenus Singers beganne his Catch, and so marched forward towards the State. The Catch. Silenus. Ahay, for and a hoe, Lets make this great Potan Drinke off Silenus kan: And when that he well drunke is, Returne him to his Munkeis, From whence he came. Then Kawashaes side answered. Kawasha. Ahay, for and a hoe, Wee'l make Silen fall downe, And cast him in a sowne, To see my men of Ire, All snuffing, puffing smoke and fire, Like fell Dragon. The Freemans Song. Silenus. Kawasha comes in maiestie, Was neuer such a God as he, He is come from a farre Countrey, To make our Noses a chimney. Cho. Silenus Asse doth leere to see His well appointed companie. The Fidlers of Silenus frumpled ouer the last verses. Kawasha. The Wine takes the contrary way, To get into the hood: But good Tobacco makes no stay, But seizeth where it shood. More incense hath burne At great Kawashaes foote, Then to Dilen and Bacchus both, And take in Ioue to boote. Therefore doe yeeld, Cho. And quit the field, Or else Ile smoake yee. These verses frumpled ouer by the Musicke of Kawasha. Silenus. The Worthies they were nine, 'tis true, And lately Arthurs Knights I knew, But now are come vp Worthies new, The Roaring Boyes Kawashaes crew. Cho. But if Silenus Asse should bray, T'would make them roare and run away. Silenus tappes the Barrell, but Tobacco tappes the Braine, And makes the vapours fine and soote, That man reuiues againe. Nothing but fumigation Doth chase away ill spirits, Kawasha and his Nation Found out these holy rites: Therefore doe yeeld, And quit the field, Or else Ile smoke yee. This song all ioyne and sing. Ahay, for and a hoe, Tee Asse still lookes ascaunce a, But strife in Song, It is too long, Lets end it in a daunce a. After the Song ended; they marched all out in the same order they came in, their Musicke playing. Then entred the Anticke-maske of Daunce, consisting on Silenus side of a Kawashaes of a Pantalon Fretelyne Curtezan. Bawde. Swisse and Roaring Boy his wife. Citizen. Usurer Mountebancke Midwife. Iewesse of Portugall. Smugge and Chimney sweeper and his wench. his wench. The Daunce ended, the lowd Musicke sounded. The Trauers being drawne, was seene a Garden of a glorious and strange beauty, cast into foure quarters, with a crosse walke and allies, compassing each quarter. In the middle of the crosse walke, stood a goodly Fountaine raised on foure columnes of Siluer. On the toppes whereof stoode foure statues of siluer, which supported a bole, in circuite containing foure and twenty foote, and was raysed from the ground nine foote in height, in the middle whereof vppon scrowles of siluer and gold was placed a Globe garnished with foure golden Maske-heads, out of the which issued water into the bole, aboue stood a golden Neptune, in height three foote, holding in his hand a Trident, and riding on a Dolphin so cunningly framed, that a Riuer seemed to streame out of his mouth. The Garden walls were of bricke artificially painted in Perspectiue, all along which were placed fruite trees with artificiall leaues and fruite. The Garden within the wall was rayled about with rayles of three foote high, adorned with Ballesters of Siluer, betweene which were placed pedestalls, beautified with transparent Lights of variable colours, vpon the Pedestalls stood siluer columnes, vpon the toppes whereof were personages of golde, Lions of gold, and Vnicornes of siluer, euery personage and beast did hold a torchet burning that gaue light and lustre to the whole fabrique. Euery quarter of the Garden was finely hedged about with a lowe hedge of Cipresse and Iuniper: The knottes within set with artificiall greene hearbs, embelished with all sortes of artificiall Flowers. In the two first quarters were two Piramides garnished with golde and siluer, and glistering with transparent lights, resembling Carbuncles, Saphires, and Rubies. In euery corner of each Quarter were great pottes of Iilliflowers, which shadowed certaine lights placed behind them, and made a resplendent and admirable lustre. The two further quarters were beautified with Tulipaes of diuers colours, and in the Middle, and in the Corners of the said quarters were set great tufts of seuerall kindes of Flowers, receiuing lustre from secret lights placed behind them. At the farther end of the Garden was a Mount raised by degrees, resembling bankes of earth, couered with grasse: on the top of the Mount stood a goodly Arbour substantially made and couered with artificiall trees, and with arbour flowers, as Eglantine, Honnysuckles, and the like. The Arbour was in length three and thirtie foote, in height one and twenty, supported with termes of gold and siluer, it was diuided into sixe double arches, and three doores answerable to the three walks of the Garden. In the middle part of the Arbor rose a goodly large Turret, and at either end a smaller. Vpon the toppe of the Mount, on the front thereof was a banke of Flowers, curiously painted, behind which within the Arches the Maskers sate vnseene. Behind the Garden ouer the toppe of the Arbour were set artificiall trees appearing like an Orchard ioyning to the Garden, and ouer all was drawne in perspectiue, a firmament like the Skies in a cleere night. Vpon a grassy seate vnder the Arbor sate the Garden-Gods, in number twelue, apparrelled in long roabes of greene rich taffata, Cappes on their heads, and chaplets of Flowers. In the midst of them sate Primauera, at whose intreaty they descended to the Stage, and marching vp to the King, sung to Lutes and Theorboes. The Song that induced the Charme. Cant. 1. Giue place you ancient powers, That turned men to Flowers, For neuer Writers pen, Yet tolde of Flowers return'd to Men: Cho. But miracles of new euent, Follow the great Sun of our firmament. The Charme. Hearken ye fresh and springing Flowers, The Sunne shines full vpon your earth, Disclose out of your shady bowers, He will not blast your tender birth: Discend you from your hill, Take spirit at his will, No Flowers, but flourish still. The Charme ended, the Gods retire to their places, the lowd Musicke againe sounded. The bankes of flowers softly descending and vanishing, the Maskers, in number thirteene appeared, seated in their Arches, apparrelled in doublets and round hose of white sattin, long white silke stockings, white sattin pumpes. The doublet richly imbrodered in curious panes with imbossed flowers of siluer, the panes bordered with imbrodery of carnation silke and siluer. The hose cut in panes answerable to the embroderie of the doublets. The skirtes of the doublets embrodered and cut into Lillies flowers, and the wings set forth with flowers of seuerall colours, made in silke, and frosted with siluer, ruffe bands, edged with a lace of carnation silke &amp; siluer, spangled very thicke, and stucke full of flowers of seuerall kindes, faire vizards and tresses, delicate Cappes of silke and siluer flowers of sundry kindes, with plumes of the same, in the toppe whereof stucke a great bunch of Egrets. Euery Maskers pump fastned with a flower sutable to his cappe; on their left armes a white skarfe fairely embrodered sent them by the Bride, and on their hands a rich paire of embrodered gloues, sent them by the Bridegroome. The lowd Musicke ceasing, the Maskers descend in a gallant Match through three seuerall doores of the Arbor to the three seueral Allies of the Garden, marching till they all met in the middle Allie vnder the Fountaine, and from thence to the Stage, where they fel into their first measure. That ended, the Preists descend againe, and sung the second Song. The Song referring to the Deuice of the Transforming. Cant. 2. Thrice happy Flowers, Your leaues are turn'd into fine haire, Your stalkes to bodies streight and faire, Your sprigges to limmes, as once they were, Your verdure to fresh bloud, your smell To breath, your bloomes your seedy Cell, All haue a louely paralell. Cho. The Nimphs that on their heads did weare you, Henceforth in their hearts will beare you. That done, they daunce their second measure, after which followes the third Song, referring to the Ladies. Cant. 3. Of creatures are the flowers (faire Ladies) The prettiest, if we shall speake true, The Earths Coronet, the Sunnes Babies, Enamild cuppes of Heauens sweet dew, Your fairer hands haue often blest them, When your Needles haue exprest them. Ch. Therfore though their shapes be changed, Let not your fauours be estranged. This ended, they tooke their Ladies, with whom they daunced Measures, Corantoes, Durettoes, Moriscoes, Galliards. Then was sung the fourth Song, hauing reference to the King. Cant. 4. All things returne with Time, But seldom do they higher clime Yet vertue soueraigne Mends al things, as they come again; This Ile was Brittaine in times past, But then was Britiain rude &amp; waste, But now is Brittaine fit to be, A seate for a fift Monarchie. Offer we to his high deserts, Cho. Praises of truth, incense of hearts, By whom ech thing with gaine reuerts. Then they daunced their parting Measure, at the end whereof followed this last Song, hauing reference to the married couple. Louely couple, Seasons two, Haue perform'd what they can doe, If the Gods inspire our Song, The other two will not stay long, Receiue our Flowers with gracious hand, As a small wreathe to your Garland. Flowers of honour, Flowers of beautie, Are your owne, we onely bring Flowers of affection, Flowers of duetie. The Maske ended, it pleased his Maiestie to call for the Anticke-Maske of Song and Daunce. which was againe presented; and then the Maskers vncouered their faces, and came vp to the State, and kissed the King, and Queene, and Princes hand, with a great deale of grace and fauour, and so were inuited to the Banquet.</field>
