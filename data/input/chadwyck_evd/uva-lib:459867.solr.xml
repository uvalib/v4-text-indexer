      <field name="fulltext">THE SIEGE OF Constantinople; A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE TO THE Siege of CONSTANTINOPLE. Poets and Duellists have the same Fate; The bravest man may be Unfortunate: You that resolve to rayle at every Play, Like pious men, worldly delights betray; But if you will ne're please your selves you may. So mirth is lost, whilst Fools dispraise the Wine; So Punk is dangerous be she ne're so fine; Thus subtly you 'gainst all your joys combine. And warily by Arguments destroy Those very pleasures which you should enjoy: Love Crown'd with Beauty and Success can cloy. Since at the best, your pleasures are so few, Make your selves any where you find 'em new. Be kind to us; and she who faild to Night: This Play, if prais'd, to morrow will invite To meet you here, and your lost time requite. 'Tis true, of late you justly have complain'd: But thank your selves for what your Niceness gain'd; When you before were such high Critticks grown, As if Wit only were by Censuring known In praising, where 'tis due, Wit may be shown. Severity does modest Authors fright Self-prizing Fops with French Assurance write. Those who have Wit, like wary Gamesters fear To hazard sums, where but small gains appear. Whilst empty Fools more briskly do expose A Reputation, which they cannot Lose.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. The Curtain drawn, discovers the Emperor, Thomazo, Theophilus, and Dorello on one side of a Table, the Cardinal, Chancellor, and Justiniano on the other, as at Councel; they arise and Exeunt, all with great reverence to the Emperor, except Thomazo and Dorello, who stay with him. Thom. Sir, they have carry'd it, and you agree, It is by strength of Argument &amp; Reason; Since they've the major part: yet I'le confess I'm unconverted still. This Rule of most Appears to me stark madness; when that most Are plainly prejudic'd, and led by faction, In that case be they ne're so numerous, All should be counted nothing that they say, For such arn't Counsellors but Advocates, And plead the cause of their own Interest. Emper. But Brother say, how Princes like my self, That circumscribe our actions by our Laws, Can steer through all the Labyrinths of state, Shun Rocks and sholes hid under smoothest brows; Meet and dispise cross Tides, and adverse Winds; That run and blow from several States-mens heads, More various in their Changes far than those That puzzle able Pilotes on the Sea; What way I say, but by these major Votes, The true Magnetick needle of the States. Thom. Sir, I'le allow Councels the perfect compass. And major Votes in that the needle too. But yet true Pilotes still observe, the Causes Oft make that vary from the polar Star, Which when they see it does, let that point on, They mind it not; but to observe its errour; And what lov'd Headland it would guide unto; And he that does not this, though he may make One Voyage safe, must not be call'd a Pilate; And this is your case now. Your this days councel That rashly have advis'd you Sir for Warr, Have several private reasons for that Vote, Besides the specious ones they back it with. Emper. I cannot think it Sir: They're all wise-men, And honest I believe; but were they not, The grand concern this Councel has debated Affects no less than all the Christian world: It is indeed, chuse Christ or Mahomet, Whose Law shall have the universal sway, And can a Christian think that Christians would Give selfish Councels in their Saviours cause? It is not charitable; it is not Brother Now by my Crown you're too too positive, And to no purpose neither. I'm resolv'dâ [Exeunt. Thom. Resolv'd! on your own Ruine Sir I fear. Christian! Ay, that's the word; but Interest Is the thing. That Damn'd Chancellor, Romes Pentionary lately, now the Turksâ Dorel. Nay, may be both's Sir stillâ Thom. Most likely so. H'has Province after Province, sold the Realm To this one Town almost; yet now forsooth It is below our Honours to pay Tribute, 'Las that may make a Title; as if a Turk Regarded any Title but Possession; Whilst we were able, I still prest a War, To keep the danger further from our Home, Or drive it o're the Hellespont again, But then 'twas wisely urg'd that my Ambition Aym'd to be popular amongst the Souldiers; And this my Brothers jealousie gave ear to; As if a Brother that would barely aim At Empire by Disloyalty and Treason, Would stand upon the way to compass it; No, they mistake my temper: All I seek, Is bright unsully'd glory: I'd not be Sole Monarch of the world by one base deed; No, by my great and everlasting hopes I would not, my Dorello. Dor. Sir, they know that too well, they durst not else Play with the fire that might perhaps consume 'em; But 'tis their sole Advantage you are honest. Thom. And mine too; for the horrid pangs of guilt That hourly torture them, and make 'em watch The small aud busie Whispers of the Crowd, That buz in Courts, and make the thing call'd State Ne're trouble me; I can undiscompos'd Receive some ill-taught, rugged man oth'Guard, Rudely advancing to me from his place To ask some Boon; when they at such a time Boggle, and stand amaz'd, expecting from him The guilty, tho the well deserved blow: Their Dreams too I'm assur'd are all compos'd Of Prisons, Axes, Daggers, and suddain Stabs; Flight after Battle, or such dreadful things, When mine are made of sweet and pleasant walks, By Crystal streams, set all with Bays and Mirtle; Or else in Fields, where every step I take, I meet a Love, or joyful Victory. And who would have the best part of his life, Sweet sleep so spoild, and lose its name of rest By ills, whose ends obtain'd, are far less sollid. Come then; whilst these bad men are faintly pleas'd At this new Conquest o're th'Emperors soul, And busily are framing Keys and Cyphers Falsely to give as false Intelligence; âLet thou and I Dorello, free from care, âTo mirth and love our joyful minutes spare. [Exeunt. Enter Cardinal, Chancellor, Justiniano. Card. The Prince Thomazo reason strongly urg'd Against the War, and almost carry'd it; He is a Prince of large and steady parts. Chanc. Ay Sir, the more we justly fear his power; The Empire dreads not more its forraign Foes, Then it does him at home; besides, you see How fiercely he proposes joyning with The Turks themselves, rather than Western Kings. There's rooted in his soul the Antient hate This Empire shew'd in the first holy War, When they betray'd those pious, valiant Knights, Godfrey of Bulloign, Robert of Normandy, And all the holy Cruciado'd Pilgrims, That did accompany or follow them: But let's no more of him; 'tis in his blood: He hates both you and me, nay more unjustly Envies the Deeds of our brave General, Great Justiniano here, without whose help This barb'rous Turk would quickly swallow us: But do not be discourag'd Sir; you'l find The Emperor your true and faithful Friend: And me your Servant, constant to your merit. Justin. I do not doubt it Sir, nor fear his envy, The Genowees my valiant Country-men, Give them their pay, will fight in following me, Till they and I perform such mighty things, Shall turn that envy into admiration. Envy me! It stirs my rage me-thinks to hear it nam'd; That any Greek, though of the greatest blood, Should so exalt his thoughts to envy me! Chanc. Your Anger's great, &amp; noble, Sir: but spare it; 'Twas his Ambition to have had your place. And whilst that hope continu'd, he was still Pressing for War, though now what man so Peaceful! But fear him not; I'le watch the Emperour That no affront shall e're be plac'd upon you. Justin. On me affront! what Prince so hardy dares it? Let him, that does it, though the Turks were here, Here close before our Walls, expect and find, I'le turn this noble City to a flame, And then like Zenophon from th'mid'st of Persia, I'd force my way through all the Turkish Camp, And carry back my full four thousand men To Genoa again. This I would do Sir, And on the least Affront; by Heavens I would, And tell the Emperor this, and so farewell; You've heated me; I am not fit for Councel. [Exeunt. Chanc. How his brave Rage becomes him! 'Tis a Crime In a great Souldier to be Ceremonious, They that can laugh at Death on days of's Triumph, When circl'd round with Javelings, Spears, &amp; Darts, Arrows, Pikes, Partizans, and battle-Axes; Mounted on Chariots, arm'd with murdering Sithes Mowing down life it self, in fields of men, And prais'd by plaudits of the thundering Canon, Almost annihilating those they kill; Those that (I say) can meet Death thus and smile, Need not concern themselves in lesser fears. Card. He's of that Country fame has ever courted, For Arts and Armes, sweet fertile Italy, And without Arrogance, though I'm its native: I'le say, no Nation under Heav'n comes near it Now; though its Eagles wings are quite displum'd For Souldiers, States-men, or Philosophers. Chanc. We need not travel thither Sir for proof That the true Romane vertue is not spent, Which civiliz'd the greatest part oth' World, Since in your self we have full evidence, Your Eminence speaks Rome in her full Luster. Card. My Lord, your Complement I'le send to Rome, It was I know design'd his Holiness, And I'le not rob him of it: 'Tis too high For me his poor and humble Immitator. But my Lord, All I can say won't heighten his esteem Of your true Zeal, Wisdom or Piety, That under Heaven are like to have the glory, Of rooting up this long continu'd Schisme, And giving to St. Peters Chaire his due. Chanc. 'Tis all the honour in this world I wish. Cardin. I'le not defer my Letters Sir for Rome, That they may know your pious resolution Of staking all against this barb'rous Turk. Chanc. I wish your Eminence, would press them hard For speedy succors, and that his Holiness Would interpose his sacred admonitions To reconcile the Kings of France and England, That private discords, lay'd by them aside, They might assist the general Christian Cause: Card. I shall not fail it. Chanc. Your Letters writ, the Emperors express Shall wait upon Eminence for them. Card. Your Lordships faithful Servant. Chanc. Your Eminencies Creature. [Exeunt Cardinal. Who waits there? Call Michael my new Secretary to me! Dance mighty Genius at my growing Fate, All things as well as Thee conspire my glory: What a dull Earth-born crowd of groveling souls Are all men but my self, I yet could meet with: This Cardinal, the Cato now of Rome, How I unnerve his Reason when I speak, And make his Rhetorick lacqu't after mine. That Souldier too, the Cethegus of Genoa; How I can make him by one single word Rage or be calme, humble or insolent; These are good Tooles to work with, I confess, But 'tis in hands, that mannage 'em like me, Not in an Emperors, whose honest soul Sees not the inside of his own affairs, But winds and turns, totters, and then grows steddy, Not as his own, but my designs require it. [Enter Michael. Michael, my faithful friend, though Seeming Servantâ Write presently to thy great Lord and mine, That with all speed that may be, he advances, And claps before our Walls: I in the Councel According to my promise carry'd it For War, and to refuse the Tribute he requires, The Western Princes the wise Emperor Relys on, will be long consulting on't Before that they conclude of our relief, And longer e're they send it. Micha. What excuse Shall I my Lord make unto Synan Bassa, That you have taken in 4000 men Under this Justiniano; These recruitsâ Chanc. Shall make us far more feeble than we were, As I will order it; for the Senate, I'le still possess with jealousies and fears Of Laws subverting, and religious change, That they no aid shall to the Emperor give; Then in due time these men shall mutiny, And so the Town is his: besides, these Aydes Were the sole argument against Prince Thomazo, That we would weather out the growing storm Till larger succors come from Italy. Inform the Bassa this under your Cypher, My Letters of the rest shall strengthen yours; And bid Lorenzo come [Exeunt Michael. So much for Adrianople, now for Rome. Enter Lorenzo. Lorenzo! my ever true Lorenzo; prithee quickly, Prepare a trusty Currier for Rome, To the Cardinal Patron; let your Letters be To this effect; That I've receiv'd his Bills, And thank him for 'em; Tell him too The Warrs decreed in Councel spite of Thomazo, And a Defiance sent to Mahomet, Who I believe's on's March: Next, that the Ayds He or his Holiness intends to send, Let 'em not come, till joyn'd with th'other Forces The rest o'th' Christian Princes may prepare, They may prove useless else. So far in yours.â And mine shall speak the rest. [Exit. Lorenzo. I know their mindsâ The Turk must take this Town, and then the Pope Will have no Rival Bishop in the World. Let them have their design, so I can be Gland Vizier to this growing Monarchy. [Exit. Chancel. Enter Thomazo, Dorello, Irene, Udoxia, attended by Mutantrope. Irene. Was my Ambition, but what's Natural, To our half-witted Sex. your Highness would not Be troubl'd to pursue, but to avoyd; But I'le confess before Udoxia here, And your Dorello too, the more you speak Of Love to meâ The more I must deny; nay, I shall find From every new obliging word you utter, New Arguments to make me obstinate. Thom. Ah Irene! Can harsh and cruel words like these you speak, Be prompted by your heart, and yet your brow Calme and serene, take no Impressions from it. You deal by me like wanton cruel Judges, That change a Jest with the poor Criminal Their next breath must condemne. Iren. No Sir, rather Like a just Favourite, who from his Prince Refuses to accept some mighty Grace, 'Cause it may bring his Masters prudence into question; I, through your proffer'd friendship Sir, can well Discern the Crime of state I should commit Both 'gainst your Person and this Empire too, If I should suffer you to make me yours. Thom. Wave these neglected things; Empire &amp; State They're scarce of Kin to me; but if they were, Power was design'd to make its Owner happy; Not to confine him Slave to Drudge for it. A Prince, whose Title's good, ne're never doubt: Let him studdy; but his Pow'r is so; If, (as I ne're shall wish) a Diadem Should once adorn this head. No act of mine. Act said I! not the most minute Expression Should flow from one restrain'd; No: all should know What I said should be, surely should be so. To one resolv'd to Reign on Terms like these, The Empires safe, let him do what he please; So Madam I desire you would not mix Affairs of State with my free Love. Irene. Sir, yo're so great and gen'rous, you teach me To be so too; therefore I'le plainly tell you I cannot Marry you, for I already am engag'd. Thom. Ah Madam. Dorel. Udoxia, Say no more, it must be so! You hear her own it. Udox. What is that to me? Tho I confess I'm very much amaz'd To hear her own Passion I ne're dream't of. Dor. Assoon I should believe Thomazo had A secret, hee'd not let Dorello know As that Irene has one you not partake. But Madam; let me dye in your neglects, Regarded less than your weak tatling Woman, To whom I dare be sworn you've told all this. Udox. Go false Dorello! go false wicked Lord; I now perceive the end of all your Vows; It was to mix your passion with the Princes, Not in esteem of me, but to serve him; But I'm glad this Secret was not Mine to tell you! Dor. Udoxia! you do well. Udox. No more my Lord, This is an office for your Serving-man.â Iren. My Love, like Mutantrope, your Highness Boy, Does now and then make signs, but cannot speak; This difference only is, my Love can hear, Though dumb, like him it must for ever be. Thom. Let it make signs that are as plain as his: 'Tis all I'le ask; I would but know his Name, Whose mighty merit has obtain'd your Love: Come Mutantrope, teach a Dumb God thy Artâ Ah Boy that this was truth! Thom. Signes. Mutan. answers in signes all list, Irene. What is't he says? Thoma. I shall but mock my self in telling you: But yet I willâHe says that you Love meâ Iren. Fy Sir! you make me blush. I know he did not. Dorell. He said it on my life, and swore it by signes. I'le ask him, Madam, how he comes to know it! Iren. Know it! good Dorello, say not so, I know my Duty betterâif you please Ask him, why he thinks soâ But pray my Lord, tell Truth; what were his Signes? Dor. makes signes; he answers them: Thom. whispers Iren. Dorell. He says by This, he's sure you love his Master; Then, when he brings you Letters, you first Kiss them, Then thrust 'em in your Bosom; then reading them, You Kiss at every word; besides, he says You make so much of him when he brings Letters, That he is well assur'd you Love the Sender. Thom. Do I not tell you, Madam, just the same? Iren. Come, he's a Wagg; send him no more to me, He invents all this to please you! Enter Theophilus. Theo. The Emperor Sir, has Din'd! Thom. What! will he not be at the Mask, my Lord? Theo. I scarce believe he will; He &amp; the General Are gone to view theo Wrksâyour Highness pardon! Daughter, a word with youâ Thom. Ah Udoxia! Is it not sad to be supplanted thus?â There, where I thought I'd tane a little root, Hope in my love, like early blossom'd fruit By one late frost is nipt.â Udox. Sir, I believe it is a blasting season Of love and friendship; both this noise of war Like bitter, black, and rugged North-East winds, Drives back the merry Spring of all delights. Dor. Sir, you may trust Udoxia, none knows better. Udox. Yes, by Experience, you much more Dorello!â Thom. Is my Friends Fate and mine so mixt together, That I being wretched, he must needs be so: I thought to sigh my griefs to happy Lovers, That free from their own Cares, might pitty me! Udox. I hope your Highness needs it not, since now Dorello has left sifting me for Secrets To quarrel with me. Thom. I understand not this. Udox. He will explain it when next he laughs at me. Irene is going Sir; 'tis time to dress. [Exit. Iron. &amp; Udox. Theop. The Emperor has given his final Answer To th'Turkish Chiawsâall Tribute is deny'd: So I believe we must expect a War: And that brought home to us; but 'tis no matter; Our Walls are strong, our People numerous, Rich too, beyond Saciety; so that Souldiers Will find their Pay, and they still follow that: Besides, our Western Aydes, the Cardinal Does undertake shall speedily be here. Thom. From whence? My Lord, the Pope, for all his Posts, I'm sure does wish our Ruine! His help will come When he has reconcil'd England and France, So well to joyn their Armes to succour us, That will be never; Spain is still strugling Against the Moores; and Germany Is busi'd with Religious Mutineers: Whence must come Succour then, except from Heaven, And our own Courages; which could we joyn Might do the work: but I do fear that too. Theop. First humbly craving of your Highness, pardon For arguing 'gainst your Sence; I will remember The Sultan, as the Chancellor assures us, For all his braggs cannot be here these five Moneths: Then, the Pope has 30 Galleys ready With 15000n d men: These Succours will Within Six weeks be here; or there's no Faith Left amongst Christians; for the Cardinal swears it. Then Sir, the States of Genoa and Venice Will send us 40. more; 'Tis their own business: These helps are certain Sirâ Thom. Ay; when they're here!â Theo. Sir, you are all compos'd of Unbelief; The Councel doubts, the Emperor fears it in you, And I in humble Duty tell you this. Thom. I know your hearty love does prompt these words; And I am not angry at them; but my Lord, The Court or Counsels doubts, nor Emperors fears, Shant make me silent, when I see my Prince betray'd, My Prince and Brother too; could I do that With Justice, then they might say I was guilty Of those Ambitious projects that they dream of; But the false Chancellor with all his tricks, His little purblind tricks of cokesing parties, Shall ne're gain me to be a property For him to stalk withalâ Theo. I hope your Holiness Will easily believe I had no design To put you into passion; but my Lord, 'Tis time to change the subjectâSir, the Court Does come in Masquerade tho'tis by day-light, To avoyd the Danger that some fewds may bring. Thom. Then 'tis not a set Masque. Theop. No, nothing but a Dance, or so Mixt with all freedom, for the Court Spectators To mend the Sports themselves by their own Dancing. Thom. Dorello come! Let you and I go dressâ Theop. Your Highness humble Creature. [Exeunt. Enter a Servant, Andrea and Lionello. Andr. Surely the General will come see these Sports. Lionel. No doubt on't, let's stay for him. Serv. Noble Captains! All persons will be here incognito, It is the orders of the Entertainment, And you must needs comply, or go away. Andr. Must! to a Souldier; Sawsy Groom, we won't; Let the Court-Butter-flies come how they will, We are resolv'd to shew our faces here. Serv. My Lord Chamberlain will be angry Sir: These Are his Lodgings. Lion. We care not whose they be, nor for his anger; Our Swords will find an universal freedom In spight of your Court-tricksâthen hold your pratingâ Serv. Well Gallants, mark the end on't. [Exit. Enter Irene and Eudoxia Masqu'd. Andr. These are Women Lionello sureâ Lionel. Ladys, The number's equal, and the field cleer, Why should we not engage? Andr. Ha! Dumb! these sure are moving Statues. Lion. But of Pigmalion's making, fit for Man. I'le feel if this be warm; how! Coy, Lady! Not a soft touch go down; 'tis pitty Faith I han't you singly here; wee'd sure feel out A better understanding e're we parted. Udox. How got these rude men in I wonder Cozen? Iren. Ne'r mind them Madam, the Officers will come And send 'em hence anon. Andr. No Demi-treble, there's none so bold that dares it: Therefore good Queen o'th' Diamonds, let me try How the Cherries of your lips tast. Iren. Insolent Baffoon! stand off. [Strikes him. Andr. How's this? So nimble with your upper tire, I'le try what bore your neather Quarters carry. Come, at 'em Lionella. [They ruffle them. Enter Theophilus. Theo. Ruffians! what rudeness is this? Know you this place? Andr. What an old Fool it is to ask that question. Old men are silly things: but Lionello, That shall not spoile our sport. Theop. Sure Gallants, these Are no becoming actions in a Courtâ Such places should be Sacred. Andr. Ay so are Churches, yet some are so wicked as to appoint Bawdy Meetings thereâ Sacredâa pretty word! Alas, my Lord, Your Dancing-days are done; all places now Are Sacred where you come, except for spitting. Lionel. Sure this old Lord Andrea has been right When he was young; he now does so contrive To bring young things a clicketting together. Theop. Since you are Strangers, I forgive your rudeness; But pray be gone and learn some better manners Against next time you come; or you will find This place no Court of Guardâ Lionel. Oh Heaven's Andrea! How the old Creature raves: Prithee Good man, Consider Turks are coming. Turks d'you hear!â What place will then be Sacred, if we don't By our undaunted Courage keep them so! In fine, do you see my Lord, we know this place To be our Garrison, where wee'l be free, Nay too, without the Laws of Masqueradeâ Andr. Ay Masquerade is Sacred too; I'le warrant you Though t'be intended to help folks to doâ Theo. What?â Andr. It has but an odd name, and fitter 'tis To practice, than to speak it. Stand but still Wee'l make your old Chops water presently. Theo. Villains forbear! Ho Azo! Ho Arosto! Draws; they disarm him. Lion. Keep your old Chops together, I'le Cut your Throat else. Enter Thomazo in Disguise. Thom. What Insolence is this? Villains, Slaves! Andr. This is some real Devil sure, he fights so. [Fights: [He throws down one, and disarms the other. Thom. That needs not be; for you Ladies, you are safe. What are you, dare do this? [Unmasques. Andr. We are Souldiers, like your Highness: Italian Officers: We were on slight discoveries pickeering a little. Enters Servants. Thom. Your General shall know this; There, secure them. Theo. To th'Porters Lodge with themâha! Is't you. [The Ladies Unmaske. What made you out so soon? Iren. T'avoid being known! for who could think such Ruffians Could have got in! I hope your Highness has not receiv'd a hurt. Thom. No new one: But I'le go Out for a little time, and shift my shape, and then return; I else may spoile the Mirth, by being known. [Exit Thoma. and Theoph. Enter Calista; they go to Mask: She unmasks. Irene. 'Tis our best way to do so too Udoxia. Calist. Nay, 'tis too late Ladies, I know you both; But I will be so just, you shall know me. Irene. Calista! 'Tis a pretty Vest that you have on. Calist. But I do like your dress much better Madamâ Udox. 'Tis not the Cloaths, but Friendship prompts this liking; As change, and you will see. Calist. Withal my heart.â Irene. I readily consent. Udox. Come then retire, You'l see 'tis not the Cloaths you both admire. [Musick plays; Enter several persons as to Masquerade; amongst them Thomazo, Dorello, Irene, Udoxia, and Calista. A Song. After the Song, a Dance led by Ambition, Represented by a Monster with many Bodies, and but one Head, with a Crown upon it, follow'd by War, Famine, Murder, and Death: The Dance brought up by Fame, represented by one Body, and several Heads and Hands, each having a Trumpet in it. Towards the end of the Dance Thomazo removes towards Calista, supposing her to be Irene by her Habit. Thom. This is Irene; I know her by her Dress: Love, Madam, like to yours, is a worse Monster Than black Ambition is describ'd to be; For Fame attending him does always sound Such loud Alarmes to the drowzy World, That men to Armes can fly for their defence; But against silent Love there is no guard. Calist. Love tells me 'tis the Prince Thomazo's voyce! But why all this to me? I cannot tell, Except my heart has taught my eyes to speak And say that bleeds for him. Thom. My Mutantrope Has by his signes, I fear, done me some hurt: But Madam, be not too severely angry; He ne're shall take that liberty again. Calist. 'Tis he, the naming of his Mutantrope confirms it. [aside. Now mighty Love assist me, and I'le be Thy Voteresse for ever. Noble Prince! Your Highness Love has chosen too low an object, If I be it, as I shall ever doubt. Thom. Ah Madam, say not so!â [They Whisper. Iren. Why should Thomazo single thus Calista. [A Jigg here. Thom. You made me Madam, more than happy now. Irene. What's this? Curst be my Ears for hearing it, And Curst be all men for Thomazo's sake! Is he so amorous that Calista can Possess a place in that false heart of his; Calista, whom he always seem'd to loath For being Daughter to the Chancellor. Thom. Madam! I'le keep my word; no trick of State Shall bar my happiness: At break of Day, In St. Sophia's Church I'le meet you, Madam, Just by our Ladies Altar: Bring Udoxia, I'le bring Dorello, they will be enow To witness we are Marry'd. Irene. But false man! You shall have more, for I'le be there my self To throw thy broken Vows 'mongst those you make: Those shall give Plagues to all your Nuptial hours, And change the Blessings of the Priests to Curses. Thom. Let not your Father know the least of this, That Notice may not be taken of our Whispers. I'le lead you out to Dance. Udox. Be not too rash, consider 'tis your self Did give him cause for this; you own'd you Lov'd, And said with all, you ne're could Marry him. Iren. In such an Aire, and such a Tone I spoke it; It could not mean him ill. [Dance of Eight. But see my Father.â Enter Theophilus, Emperor, Justiniano, Andrea, Lionello, Mutantrope, Guards. Theop. The Emperor is present, and commands That all avoyd the Room, who're in Disguise, Except the Prince Thomazo.âPray withdraw. [Ex. All the Masquers. Emper. Brother, 'tis strange you bear no more respect To our Commands, nor to the General, But have Imprison'd these two Officers Without his Privity. Thom. I know your Majesty did ne're intend To exempt them from common Justice, And make them Lawless. Their Insolenceâ Justian. Insolence! How mean you by that word? I'd have your Highness eat it up again, And call't neglect.â Thom. How! eat my words my Lord? The Sacred presence of this dread Majesty Restraines me, or by Heav'nâ Justin. What would you else? Nay, what durst you do my Lord? my Honour Full fledg'd can mount above your weak observance, Though you're oth' Eagles Brood.â Emp. How's this? My Lord, do you our Brother know? And where you speak this to him? Just. Yes Sir! orâ Thom. Or what? Let not your Pride profane thisâ Justin. Profane aâ Empr. Out of our presence. Justin. Ay, and your Empire to. I'le beat my Drums but for an exercise, And sport my men out of your large Dominionsâ Empr. Seize on the Traytor!âSo, convey him hence To the Castle, Prisoner. I'le ne're indure this. Justin. Send all my men to Prison too, else in vain You hope to keep me here.â [Ex. Justin. Guards. Thom. Your Majesty May now perceive the Insolence of Strangers, When once they know you need them: But I am Too blame to urge this nowâ Emp. No, not at all; By this one hours discourse I have had with him, I find his Pride to be beyond enduring; He boasts our Safety must proceed from him, And quotes the Chancellor for saying this; I do begin to doubt the Arts of him too. Thom. Sir, he's a Traytor, or I'm not a man. Enter Chancellor. Chanc. Your Majesty must pardon this Intrusion, Your Highness too; my hasty Zeal requires it; Letters just now arriv'd bring certain word The Sultan's on his March, and will this Night Be lodg'd before our Walls. Thom. How's this my Lord? Emp. By this Surprizal we are lost for ever. Ah gracious Heav'n, take back this burden, life, Before I see the Miseries are coming. Thom. This ill agrees my Lord with your last news Of five moneths hence, they cou'd not come before; But 'tis what I expectedâThis suddain danger Must prompt your Majesty with double Vigour To make sharp oppositionâSir, arrest All Ships are in the Harbour, sieze their stores Of Guns and Ammunitionâwith the Guards, And some oth' Genoway Foot: I'le out and meet 'em.â Emp. No! I am resolv'd To Head our first attempt with my own person. The Turks shall find 'tis not our want of Courage, But factions in our State that makes them be Successful still in all their Wars against us. Tho. Good Sir be pleas'd to trust me with this Sally: Your presence is most needful in the Town; At such a time as this you'l find the people Prompted by fear too apt for all sedition; May be the Souldiers too may take advantage Of the first uprore which this news will bring, And fall to doing mischief; besides great Sir, You'l find new Orders every minute needful, Which none but your Authority can give. Emp. Your reasons shall perswade me, go Thomazo, And may Heav'n Crown thy Sword with Victory. Thom. Good Sir be strong To your Imperial self, that's all I'le say; If so, I make no doubt by th'help of Heav'n To drive this Sultan back with as much shame As once his Father found when he besieg'd us. [Ex. Thomazo. Chanc. The Prince does shew a great and generous Soul, And will no doubt perform all that he speaks; But give me leave to think he has his ends In all he does or saysâSir, this advice Of seizing all the Ships, the Senate sitting With wonted freedom, I must boldly say Shews he would put you on ungrateful things, Whilst he pursues the popular himself. Empr. My Lord, your Circumspection wears a Cloud I cannot well see through; and I must tell you Your false Intelligence and close intriguing Give me some hints for doubts; but let your actions Wear a more candid out-side, 'tis not else Your Interest in the Senate shall protect you. No Sir! it shall not! but no reply my Lord: As for my Brother, I am sure he loves me; I've found he has, and cannot now suspect him. Chanc. Do not Sir; but yet I must attempt T'unloose one charme h'has plac'd upon your Soul. That's Sir, about the Generalâ'Tis not a time To stand on slight punctilio's with such men As understand them not: This his restraint May chance endanger all; grant Sir, his freedom. Empr. I cannot do't, and Majesty be safe: His Insolence both to the Prince and me Was more then Brutalâ Chanc. But your Majesty Should well consider leading Circumstances That did provoke him to't: The Prince you know Had 'gainst conditions of his Entertainment Imprison'd two of's Captainsâ Empr. Speak no more on't; âI'le not release him till my Brother please; âContempt of Pow'r is a State's worst Disease. [Exeunt. End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE The Palace. Enter Emperour and Chancellour discoursing. Emp. These doubts of theirs concerning such wild things, That Soveraign Pow'r may do, amaze me; Because 'tis possible we may do harm, Will they conclude we certainly do it? Chanc. Your Majesty Has had no cause to doubt their steddy Loves To your Imperial Interest and Person. Emp. 'Tis true, my Lord, nor can my memory Prompt me with want of care of them or theirs: None of my Predecessors ever were More careful of Propriety than I; Therefore I cannot chuse but take unkindly Motions, like these, just on the Neck of War. Enter Theophilus. Theop. Our Scouts are beaten in; the Turks Van-guard Are easily discern'd from off the Steeples, Which does all the Streets produce the Crys Of Women, Children, and the heartless Crowd That nothing but Confusion fills the Town. Emp. It can't be help't; my Lord, we must endure it. These Noises fill the Streets of every place, When they are first besieg'd; a day or two Will quiet all their minds. Theop. I hope it will; but, my Lord Chancellour, The short five moneths, since morning, makes me doubt I have unknown unto my self been sleeping; Or else that your Intelligence deceives you: Or if not that, then you deceive us all. Chanc. Methinks, my Lord, the liberty you take, Doth scarce become this Presence. Theop. Why, my Lord, I'm sure his Majesty will pardon me, Since 'tis my plain and honest heart that speaks; And I must own, it was your bold affirming, That we had full five moneths for preparation, Which got my Vote for War. But now I fear The Rumour's true, that you have got a Turk To manage your Intelligence. Chanc. How's this? Your Majesty, I hope, will do me Justice Against this Calumny? Emp. Lord Chamberlain, What grounds have you for this? Theop. Truly no more Than half the Lords o'th' Councels just suspition; Nay, the better half; but they perchance may err, It is not the first time, witness the approaching Siege. Chanc. My Lord, you would have done more like a Friend T'have told me of such Rumours privately. Theop. Good my Lord, is not this Presence private? Who's here but's Majesty, and you, and I; As I am a Privy Councellour I speak it. Chanc. Explain your self; who, and what is't you mean? Theop. I mean you have a Secretary call'd Michael.â Some say he's a Turk; Enter Michael. And this Sir is the Man. Chanc. What causes this Intrusion? Micha. I come in haste To give you notice all the English Ships, And the Venetian too, are under Sail; Except they be arrested presently, They will get past the Forts. Emp. Is not the Warrant issu'd for their stay? Chanc. A Broad-Seal-Warrant too. Mich. That Sir they slight. Emp. They might slight Death as well. Mich. Sir, they pretend The Senate says it is against the Law, That they should be Arrested, Chanc. Think of that Sir; If they resent the deed, 'tis not the stores Of those few Ships can recompence the loss Of their affections. Emp. Nor can their best Zeal Find such another timely succour near To draw to our supply. Chanc. Do as you please, But I dare pawn my life that they'l be troubl'd? Theop. At their departure most, I'le warrant you; At nothing else, my Head on't. Emp. But what then? Shall I neglect my duty to the whole For private mens resentments? Come, my Lord, I'le see it done my self. Ex. Emp. and Theop. Chanc. Michael! how is't? Mich. Gone Sir; beyond Redemption; both the Consuls Were at your House but now: There I advis'd them, With all the haste that might be, to set Sail, Whatever Orders they shou'd see to stop them. Chanc. 'Tis very well; then you are sure they're gone? Mich. My Zeal had never seem'd so earnest else. Chanc. That happen'd well though: 'twill clear a late suspition That you're a Turk.â But more of that anonâYou sent the Warrant. Mich. Aye Sir; but gave command to him that went To say you seal'd it much against your will: Besides, I spread it every where abroad, That 'twas against the Law; so none would act by't. Chanc. That is a certain Method to confound things; And 'tis the way I'le take; for I perceive I've lost some ground i'th' Emperours affections, And now must keep my Pow'r more by the Vogue O'th' Senate, than his love; but let's go out, And view Thomazo's Actions in the Field; 'Tis to his Genius only mine does yield. Exeunt. SCENE. A Field. Great Shouts and Noise of Fighting: Enter Thomazo, Dorello, Officers with Swords drawn. Thom. These Turks are less than Women in our hands; Where e're we shew our Faces, still they fly; If but the rest o'th' Forces sally'd out, This Night would make a perfect end o'th' Siege. Dor. Their great Forlorn is routed totally, And their Main Body staggar'd, five thousand more Would have perform'd the work.âIn all the Fight I met but one brave Foe that durst make Head; And when my Sword had made him Prisoner, He prov'd a Genowees. Thom. What did you with him? Dor. Clapt my Sword through him Sir. Thom. You did do well; A Renogado Dog is ripe for Hell. A Shout. Dor. See my Lord, they'r marching on agenâ Will you to Horse? Thom. The Hedges make them useless; I'le Charge i'th' Head of yonder Stand of Pikes. Exeunt. Shouts.âEnter Turks drove in by Synan, Mustapha, and other Bassa's. Synan. What wretched fearful Slaves! dare you not die? Can you forget the Laws of Destiny? Musta. Fight; or the Death you'd shun, you'l sooner find; Our Swords give Death to all who seek to fly. Shouts.âEnter Thomazo, Dorello, and Christians: They fight a while, the Turks retire fighting. Thomazo, Dorello, re-enter in haste. Thom. To Horse, to Horse, the Genoway Body shrinks. Let's Presently relieve them. Exeunt. Enter Synan. Synan. These Christians fight, as if the General Cause Did wield each Sword.âCurse on our wretched Slaves,â How fast they Rout!âLead on the Grand Reserve To succour the Main Body.âNow by my Fathers Soul, Morat's strong Troop of our best Spahi Horse, Fly like loose leafs before the Autumn wind: We're betray'd by that Damn'd Chancellour: Their strength's the Flower of all the Christian World, They could not fight thus else.âOh mighty Prophet! Protect our Sultan's Glory.â Let not a Cheating Gown-man boast he had Great sums from us for nothing else but shame. But yet it will be so; our great Reserve Under the Grand Vizier does stagger too:â Draw up our Guards, let's save or ruine all; 'Tis better much to die than wear the shame Of being thus defeated by a handful. Exeunt. SCENE. The Town. Enter Emperour, Cardinal, Chancellour, Theo. Attendants. Cardin. The Prince I swear perform'd prodigious things! They'd be incredible but that we saw them. Chanc. Accursed sight! The Turkish Army's sure compos'd of Women. Emp. Theophilus, Command that all the Forces Do presently draw out; I will my self Share part o'th' Glory in the Turks Defeat. Chanc. Good Sir, consider What 'tis you mean to do? Will you expose Your Sacred Person 'mongst the Genoweese, That openly avow their discontents? Emp. No, let them stay behind; I am satisfi'd That our own Forces are enough without them, To second this Success, and Rout the Turks. Chanc. But say Sir, when you're out with all your strength, That they should seize the Town. Emp. They dare not sure.â Chanc. It is but ill to try inraged Strangers: Besides the Night comes on. Theo. Good Sir, send out, and do not go your self. Chanc. The Prince I'm confident will take that ill. 'Twill seem to doubt his Courage, or his Conduct. Emp. His Soul's above all Envy I am sure: But I'le go try the temper of the Souldiers, Then either back the Sally, or go meet him. Exeunt. Enter Irene, Udoxia, Calista, meeting the Emperour; they Salute, and part. Iren. She triumphs in his Love, and makes me Mad. Udox. Conceal your anger Madam, 'tis too clear. Iren. By Nature I am temperate as Day; When gentle Western Gales blow in the Spring; But now I could grow rugged like the North, And in a Tempest of my Fury tear Those Eyes out that have thus bewitch'd my Prince. Udox. Bear up; my mind perswades me he is not false, Though she invites me for her Bed-fellow. Iren. But will you go? Udox. Aye, with design to serve you, By putting him in mind of's Vows to you. Iren. Do not do that; no, let her take his heart; But yet I know not why: I'le meet you there. Calist. Oh that the Prince would come, I long to see himâ I hope he is not hurt. Iren. What if he be? Calist. I would not for the world he shou'd methinks. Iren. Nay, sure i'th' world there's many better Princes. Calist. No, I believe not one, if we consider His most Heroick Courage, and wise Conduct. Iren. Besides his Faith in Love; pray name that too. Udox. Ireneâ [Whisper. Calist. Sure she does guess at something that has past Between the Prince and me, which stirs her Envy. Enter Emperour, Thom. Cardin. Theop. Dorell. Mutantrope, Attendants. Thom. This is the Cause of our too quick return; The Genoway Body did betray the Field; And now do seem to threaten Mutiny: They bring indeed the War within our Walls: Had I been seconded with the like number Of our own Nation, we had done the work. Emp. To th'specious reasons of the Chancellour I must impute the loss of this Days Triumph; I did my self intend to second you. Chanc. Great Sir, blame not that Counsel did proceed From Zeal to th'Princes Glory, and your safety. Thom. I beg, my Lord, you'd spare your daily pains In serving me in these unthankful ways. Chanc. 'Tis my misfortune Sir, they always prove so. Emp. Brother, you had these Ladies hearty wishes For good success and safety, I am sure. Thom. 'Twas those, next to your Fortune, did preserve me: But Lady, may I think I was so happy To have my share in the last Pray'rs you made? Iren. I should have lost my Sense of Duty else; You are a Mighty Prop o'th' Empire Sir, And so, and no ways else I pray'd for you. Thom. How's this?âShe does dissemble to extremity. Calist. He casts not the least glance on me!â'tis well, He strives to keep things secret. Noise without. One and all, one and all, &amp;c. Enter Michael. Mich. The Genowees are in Mutiny, And swear they'l have their General set free, Or else they'l fire the Town. Emp. What's to be done? Thom. Sir, I advise to hang their General, That will soon quiet them; but if it don't, Then let the other Souldiers fall upon 'em, And knock 'em all o'th' heads;âif they hold on As they've begun, they'l do but little service: Those Thousand I had with me first did rout With all the men I had.âSir, there's no way But sudden Execution, or good words; Hanging or granting still, quells Mutinies. Emp. Well, draw up the Court-guards about the Palace, Then act as you see cause. Ex. all but Thom. Dor. and Mutantrope. Thom. I find the Chancellour by little Arts Prevented our Relief with greater Succours: But I perceive my Brother so suspects him, He'l scarce prevail again. Dor. I wish he don't; But you have heard the Shipping all are sail'd? Thom. Aye, there's another Trick of his contriving; I'd almost pawn my life.âBut we must play The Cards we still have left, or lose the Game. But all discourse of State and War apart, Let's talk of Love a little now Dorello; In what condition's yours and fair Udoxia's? Dor. Just as your Highness left it, full as bad As yours with fair Irene. Thom. If it be no worse, 'Tis as you'd wish't I'm sure; for to be short, To morrow Morn before the Sun doth rise, I meet Irene in S. Sophia's Church, Where you are to be witness of our Marriage. Dor. Can this be so? Thom. Udoxia will confirm it,âfor she is to be there. Come let's away, A Noise agen, One and All. And quell these Mutiniers. They fright the Town. Exeunt. Enter Justiniano, Andrea Lionella, and Souldiers.âShouting. Just. I thank you Fellow-Souldiers for your love, I'd rather have my Liberty by you, Than by their slighted favour. Andr. See the Prince! Enter Thomazo, Dorello, and Guards. Thom. What means this Tumult? Ha! Justiniano Head it! VVhat are your Demands? Sould. Our Pay we'd have.â [Thomaz. runs the Sould. through, they all hang their heads. Thom. There's thine.âNow, what the rest? Then worthy General yours. Justin. Revenge for late affronts given me by thee. Thom. DorelloâI Commandâthat word's not usual; But I Command not a man stir to help me, Except opprest by Numbers. They fight, Thomazo disarms him. Justin. I the same. Then take my Life, for I despise to beg it. Thom. Or I to take it; no, the Law shall do it. All to your Quarters; I'le procure your Pardons: If not, fall on, and kill 'em every man. Convey him back to'th' Castle where he was. Exeunt. Enter Chancellour and Mutantrope. Chanc. To morrow, fair Irene, to morrow morn! Mut. Aye Sir, I heard him tell Dorello so. Chanc. In S. Sophia's Church by break of day, Near to our Ladies Altar; is't not so? Mutan. Aye, my Lord, so the appointment's made. Chanc. Well, my good Boy, watch close upon his actions, And bring me word of every thing thou gain'st. Mutan. I shall my Lord. Ex. Mutan. Chanc. Marry Irene!âno, it must not be,âit sha'nt: But how shall I prevent it? there's it!âTo tell The Emperour, would but betray my self! For I've no proof to vouch, but this same Boy, Which I presented him as a choice Mute, To be a Spy for me on all his actionsâ But yet I must prevent it, that's decreedâ His two last Actions shew he is a Prince, Not of a common Fortune, To shake the Turks whole Army with a handful, And quell that Mutiny in half a Minute, In which I plac'd my hopes; were things prodigious, His Mighty Genius has a strong Attendant O're all my Fortune.âI must remove himâ 'Tis no matter how, so I can do't.â Enter Michael with Letters. Mich. Amongst Thomazo's Souldiers, there got in Two Spies from Synan Bassa, both with Letters, I have decipher'd them.âThe first, it seems, Were writ before the Fight, and only speak The Numbers that besiege us, and require An hourly intercourse during the Siege: The second are pursuant to the Sally writ in heat, And there, my Lord, they are.â Chancellour reads them. Chanc. O Michael! I am lost to all my hopes; The Sultan frowns, it seems, and doubts my Faith. He says the Sally had lik'd to have prov'd the loss Of their whole Army.âWhat shall I do? This Prince Thomazo does, Like some tall Cedar, blast my Underwood. I must destroy him. Find me out some Jew That studies PhysickâNo, I've another wayâ Write Letters to the Bassa that may speak What I've done this day towards the Service. The Christian Ships are sail'd, and I prevented More Forces that were going to the Sally, Besides the Mutiny Lorenzo stir'd Amongst his Countrymenâand all things elseâ O'th' doubts I raise i'th' Senateâremember allâ But here's a Sacrifice of Peace I'le make, Pulls out Irene's Picture. This is the Picture of the fair Irene; I got it from my Daughter; send it him, And tell him, that the Original shall be Lodg'd in his Masters Arms to morrow night. Prepare a score of Ruffians with a Barge To carry off the Prize; it shall go hard, But I'le send off the Prince Thomazo too: You know the way of holding Correspondence; I'le say no more of thatâgo, haste your Letters, And send Lorenzo hither. Ex. Michael. I'le go meet In some disguize the discontented Captains. Enter Lorenzo. Lorenzo! I am resolv'd to laugh to night, And spend some hours with frolick Woman-kind. Loren. My Lord, you know your old house, Mother Somelies, You know she always fits you with fresh Girls. Chanc. Aye, there we'll be; but then for Company, Get your two Friends, the Captains, if you can, I mean those two that were made Prisoners. Loren. I'm confident with joy they'l meet my Lord. Chanc. I would be thought some wild loose Friend of yours That mean to treat. Loren. I understand your Lordship. Chanc. Some two hours hence. Till then I will to Court. Exeunt. Enter Emperour, Thomazo, Cardinal, Dorel. Theophilus, Mutant. Irene, Udoxia, Calista, Attendants, as at Court. Thom. Pray Madam, how seems Time to move to you, To me it does appear extreamly slow. Iren. It may be so, my Lord, but unto me He keeps his usual pace. Thom. Madam, Your coldness now surprizes me as much As did the Larum of your Love to day. Iren. Good, my Lord, you'l make Calista jealous. Thom. You are too cautious, Madam. Iren. She's not so. Thom. I understand you not. Iren. My Lord, Good-night, I am a bad Dissembler of Passion, I find it will break out; therefore I'le go And waste, this Night in Tears. Thom. Why so Irene? Iren. My Lord, no more, I still must wish you well. Thom. Remember six a Clock. Iren. I shall have cause. Ex. Irene. Enter Chancellour. Chanc. I shall bring Company will spoil the Sport;â Your Highnesses Boy I see waits very close: I never see him from you. Thom. No, 'tis a pretty Spaniel, He's always diligent to Fetch and Carry. Chanc. I'm glad I did present him to your Highness, Since he's so acceptable. Thom. All Favours That I receive from you must needs be so. Chanc. My Lord, I am sorry my Duty to my Master, Should make me doubt my Service unto you, As your words hint. Thom. No Argument i'th' Presence; I thank you for my Boy, that's all my Lord. [Whisper the Emp. Udox. It cannot be, my Lord, the Prince and You Are both (I'le say no more) but you're both men; And what h'has promis'd is not to Irene, But to Calista there. Dor. You do amaze me: This wild discourse has no Connexion in it. Udox. A great deal more than has your wilder Action. Dorell. I'le call the Prince to hear you. Calist. Udoxiaâ Udox. Calista calls, I cannot stay my Lord.â Ex. Ladies. Chanc. Sallies will spend our men to little purpose. Thom. 'Twill rather make us Souldiers; every Sally Made with fresh men will soon experience. Had all men Courages but like your Highness, Experience then, 'tis true, was only needful; But most by Nature are unfit for War. Thom. My Lord, you are mistaken; I affirm, There's not a man of able Bulk and Strength, But may be brought to fight proportionably, At least in Crowds they may. Chanc. Admit it so: But will the Emperour, or Senates Prudence, Suffer your Highness still t'expose your Person To hourly danger; when the Empires Hopes, Is next his Majesty, all plac'd in you. Emp. Aye, now you've touch't the String that hits my Fancy; Your Personal safety Brother; Surely that Ought to be all our care, and shall be mine: I am confident no Sally can be safe Without you Head it, nor you in any one; Therefore we will relye on future Succours. Card. Those from his Holiness will soon be here, Besides the Rhodian and Venetian Forces, I'm confident will not be long behind. Thom. These are meer Dreams of Safety. Emp. Wait a little; We have an open Port to Asia-ward, And cannot want Provisions. Good-night Brother. Ex. all but Thom. Dor. Mut. Thom. You see Dorello, this cunning Gown-man Is grown so tender of my persons safety, That to keep me well, the Turk must not be Beat. Dor. I blame him not, now you're to Marry his Daughter. Thom. I Marry her!â Dor. So Udoxia tells me, And that to morrow morning. Thom. 'Tis short warning; But who has made the Match? Dor. I know not that; But she says this you promis'd at the Mask. Thom. Pish! she mistakes, it was the Fair Irene I only spoke to there. Dor. How's this? there's some mistake: Was it the Lady That you Danc'd with you made the Promise to? Thom. Aye, what of that! Dor. Then Sir it was Calista. Thom. It is impossible, her Dress was that Irene had on, when the Souldiers ruffl'd her. Dor. Sir, that may be, but yet it was Calista, I saw her after when her Mask was off, And had a Complement from her. Thom. But why should she accept my first Address? Dor. That her Ambition taught! But will you meet? Thom. I wou'd meet Death much sooner.âYou shall go And undeceive her, if it is She that comes; But I'le be near, in hopes 'twill prove Irene. Dor. Those hopes will quickly vanish in your Highness. Thom. This Chancellour, like some unlucky Star, Does interpose his Direful Influence Through all my Happiness in Love or Honour. How strangely Wise Heav'n with unseen Links makes Chains of Fate, This Hawks good Fortune that's unfortunate. Exeunt. Enter Chanc. Loren. Andr. Lion. with 4 Wenches, and Fiddles. 1 Wench. You are the Maddest Man I ever met with. SONG. Now Fruition has empti'd our Bottles of Love, Let the Bottles of Wine fly about; The heat of that Fire, Shall inflame our desire, And Phlegmatick Dulness remove. A Health to the best, A Pox o'th' rest, And hey for the t'ther brisk Bout. Chanc. Come, Faith Madam, once again. 1 Wench. Pray Sir stay, I am not i'th' humour. Chanc. See, see, here's Gold; will this exalt thy humour? Lion. See there! You Scurvy Queans, did you fear Sconces? 1 Wench. I hope, my Dear, you'l give me some Silk Stockins. Chanc. Aye, and rich Garters too; there's twenty Pieces, Rig thy whole Vessel! what, hast found thy humour? 1 Wench. Aye, my Dear, you are such another man. Ex. Chancellour and Wench. Andr. Signior Lorenzo! your Friend's a Man of Mettle. What does he give all that? Loren. Alas, that's nothing. 2 Wench. My Dear, will you give me some? Loren. Aye, thereâthere's 20 Pieces for thee. Lion. But you Inhance the Price most damnably, I've had a better Whore for half a Crown. 2 Wench. Whore! you foul-mouth'd Fellow. Lion. Aye Whore, what came we for but Whore? 3 Wench. But, my Dear. The other two Wenches Dun the Captains round the Stage. 2 Wench. My Dear, why wou'd you bring such Shabby Fellows With you? Loren. They're honest Gentlemen, tho' they want Money. 2 Wench. Honest, faugh! A poor Rogue can't be honest; But you are the Goodest Man. Prithee, my Dear, Lend me but 10 l. more, and you will make me.â Loren. Ten pound, what's that! here 'tis for one bare Kiss. Andr. Hold Signior, for half that I've compounded; I want it but to pay, pray lend it me. Lion. And me the rest; I shan't have time to drink else. Loren. I beg your Pardon, I must not starve my Love. 3 Wench. Your Love, 'tis a fine one, she ply'd i'th' Town Seven years before I knew it. Loren. That's no matter; She has the more experience. I am constant. 2 Wench. So I will be my Dear, for all their Malice. 3 Wench. I will not loose my time thus. Exit. 4 Wench. Faith, nor I; I could 'een cry my eyes out. Exit. Lion. Now we have time to drink to thee Andrea; A Pox on High-priz'd Whoring. Chanc. and Wench re-enter. Chanc. What's here, two Turtles pining without Mates! Loren. Their Girls went crying ripe for what ours got. Chanc. That must not be Ladies; go fetch 'em in, I'le see them paid, but bring no Tears amongst us; No weeping Cupid here, we're for the Boys That Caper and shew Tricks in Ladies Eyes. Andr. 'Fore Heav'n, the merri'st Greek I ever met with; Is he a Servant o'th' Chancellours? Loren. Aye Sir. Lion. Faith you are Princes by your Places. Here's your Lords Health for your sakes; he's a Master The best i'th' Empire, all men say that. Chanc. Pox o'Great Men, and great things; they both devour All that one gives without the least delight; I'm for the Souldiers Health. Andr. Then we're your Men: We two to night did pay the Turks away. Lion. Each kill'd his Bassa; though Thomazo Huffs, As if he had done all: but time will come. I'le say no more,âour General must not lye thus. Andr. No, by my Sword,âI'le fire the City ratherâ But let that pass, I'le sing a Song I made Since we return'd from killing the Bassa's. Chanc. Rogues! that were both in Prison. But the better,â A Huffing Coward always proves a Villain. I'le taste them by and by.â SONG. Andrea. sings. They come, they come; Hark, do you hear that Drum? It is an Alarum to War; To Love it does Beat, A Fatal Retreat: See, see, where our Enemies are. A Noise, a Noise, Of Shouts and Dreadful Crys Has frighted our Scouts, they come in: Then farewel delight, Till after the Fight, We'll Rout them, and at it agen. They Fly, they Fly, Hark how they Quarter cry; Their Valour lies now in their speed: Their Bassa's in vain Would Rally again, But a Turk delights not to Bleed. Bring Wine, bring Wine, What do you still repine? To trust a brave Souldier for drink; The Enemy's run, Then Souldier be gone, He'l never return you do think. Chanc. The Wit and Courage of these Gentlemen Deserves the World Lorenzo should be theirs. Andr. Ah Sir! had we our Pay, we'd be contented: The Emperour owes us near six Weeks Pay. Chanc. You ne're shall sigh for that; I'le send it you. Lion. You shall have Imprest Bills that will secure you. Chanc. That needs not, one slight favour you may do Pays me, and trebles that unto your selves. Andr. Ask any thing i'th' compass of our Swords. Chanc. 'Tis to prevent a Wedding two wou'd steal In S. Sophia's Church by break of day: A quiet time, you know; if you will seize them, And carry them to the place I shall appoint, Lorenzo will see you paid a 1000 Duckets. Loren. You'l take my word for this, will you not Signior? Lion. Aye, wer't ten times as muchâbut we must have Some of our Men to help us, must we not? Chanc. Aye, that you must. Andr. I have a Faithful Servant, I'le send for him, And he shall pick some Men fit for the Work. Lion. We'll not to Bed to night. Andr. No, no Sleep Till the good work be done. But more Instructions.â Chanc. We shall have time for that. But where's these Women!

My Conversation ever was at Court, Though not i'th' highest Sphere, and Prince Thomazo Has often honour'd me with his Commands: But he's a Prince of such a steddy temper, 'Tis not the Sultans Empire would Bribe him To one disloyal thought, much less Morea. Synan. I do believe you Sir; and that's the cause I cannot find one man that dares attaque him, Nor do I hope Success, if you shall do't; I only by it seek to gain some proofs May shew my Prince my care has not bin wanting. Dorell. Upon the word of a true Gentleman, I'le break the matter to himâand return, My Life and Liberty continuing safe, To give you his full Answer. Synan. Sir, pardon me, You have some Secrets gain'd o'th' Chancellour Must be kept private too.â Dorell. From all but him, With whom I mainly treat, they shall, my Lord; Nor shall he know them but on faithful promises Of being private, and you may trust his word. Synan. No generous mind can well suspect another Without some cause, and I see none in you; And as a proof of my esteem, I'le trust you. Dorell. Your Frankness binds me more than Sacraments, And makes me bold to ask one Favour more, That as you'd send the Prince this Boy agen, He did esteem him much. Synan. Sir, I am sorry. I must deny you thisâBut Sir, believe me, This Boy is worth my Life; you do not know Our Sultanâthe least breach of his Commands Is Death inevitable. You heard him say He'd have him made an Eunuch; I must do't, Or never see his Face in safety more. He likes him 'cause he is a Natural Mute; He's properer for Secrets than the other. Dorell. No, not at all my Lord, for I will tell youâ Whispers. Mutant. Make me an Eunuch! before I will be that, I'le own I have both Tongue and Ears to boot. Synan. 'Tis strange observance this you tell me of; 'Tis pity he was Muteâbut come poor Childâ How's this? Mutant. will not follow, Synan takes hold of him. Dorell. I thought he guest at our Discourse. Syn. This must not save you Sir. Mutant. O good my Lord. Synan. Ha! do you delude me Sir? Dorell. No, on my Life! Synan. Sirrah! who taught you to dissemble Dumbness? Mutant. I was a Spy, plac'd on Thomazo's Actions By my Lord Chancellour. Dorell. O Monstrous Subtilty! Synan. Then as thy punishment, I will assure thee, Thy Tongue shall keep an Everlasting Silence; For I will ha'it cut out. Sir, follow me. Exeunt. SCENE. The Chancellours House.

VVhat Screech-Owl's that? ha! what a sight is this? Then I am dying too! My Lord, look down, All these lost Souls will be requir'd of you; They will, my Lord; and I can this foretel, I'th' midst of all your hopes you will find Death, By Tortures worse than ours. Some Mercy Heav'n. Dies. Chanc. Hell take thee for thy News; it meets an hour Of such Calamity, it makes Impression; See that their Bodies safely are bestow'd. Ex. Michael. VVould I had ne're begun to be thus ill, It had been better much. Then I'd best change! But how? I am gone too far to do that safely: Then farewel Virtue, since it is too late, By Ills on Ills I'le 'mount above my Fate. Exit. Enter Emperor, Thomazo, Theop. and Attendants. Noise of a Storm. Emp. This is Prodigious! 20 great Ships To Sail o're Land eight Miles, this threatens more Than all they did before. Thom. This Storm was made Only t'amuse us whilst they lodg'd the Ships Above the Chain; So to Besiege us round And cut off all Relief. Emp. That they'l now do; Never 'till now we truly found the want O'th' Christian Ships I order'd to be stopt; There was some Practice, which I shall find out, Procur'd that disobedience to those orders; All I find guilty certainly shall dye for't. Theop. He that advis'd their Sayling must be one then. Emp. I do suspect him most, but yet I can't Safely, without clear proof, Arrest his Person; The Senate would Resent it if I did. Thom. My Lord, No news o'th' Souldiers, or your Daughter? Theop. No, none at all. Thom. Surely they have convey'd 'em to the Turk? Emp. I fear that mostâBut come, Let's go to Council. Thom. Council may Cure the State; but cannot me: This Loss foretels my endless Misery. Exeunt. Enter Chancellor, Lorenzo, Boy. Loren. Thomazo makes the Guards so Vigilant, Her least Resistance, Sir, would Ruine all. Chan. Then She must be deluded by this Boy! Think you he'll do't well? Loren. Ne're doubt, my Lord, He is by Nature fram'd for Roguery. Chan. Instruct him well; But to avoid detection, Send him along with herâI must to Council. My pretty Child, Do what Lorenzo bids thee And thou shalt have my Favour. Exit Chanc. Loren. Come Keckoâ Exeunt Lor. Boy. Enter Irene Sola. What a sad life is this to be confin'd From Friends, or sight of any Humane Creature, But Cruel, unrelenting Murderers; And ne're to change this Goal but for a worse: A Sultanessâa StrumpetâAh Thomazo, Hadst thou been true, this Mischief ne're had happen'd. A Song without, after which Kecko comes in Playing. [1.] Venus chanc'd to Love a Boy, Young Adonis was her joy; He once lept from off her Knee To hunt and take an Humble-Bee. Then the Bagg to her did bring, She sigh'd, and askt him for the Sting. 2. When he look'd on, saw her Eye Drop a Tear, he strait did cry, Oh! forgive me, I will bring A bigger and a longer Sting. Smiling, she cry'd, pretty Lad, When that time comes, I'le be glad. Irene. I see there still is left some Innocence To keep the World from sinking. Pretty Boy, Which way did'st thou get in? Kecko. I'le shew you Madam. Irene. This Child may prove an Angel-Guardian to me. Exeunt. Enter Emperor, Thomazo, Cardinal, Chancellor, Theoph. as from Councel. Emp. This Insolence o'th' Souldiers so debated By the Senate first, and now by us in Councel, Does spend that time might better be employed For the safety of the whole,âfirst let the Senate Provide but Mony speedily to pay them, Strickt Discipline will follow that of course. Chanc. Your Majesty however may consider That these Debates are not without all cause, I wish to Heav'n they were, with Tears I speak, To have our Children ravish'd from our Armes; Nay, torn from Altars in despite to Heav'n, And all things, Sacred Law, Nature, and Religion, To be made Prostitutes to their vile Lusts! To have a Lord o'th' Senate and the Councel, Convey'd away and Murther'd; This brave Prince, Forc'd to defend his Sacred Person daily By his own Courage, 'gainst their Insolence, Not to speak of Prisons broke, or rescues made, And all the lesser mischiefs hourly done! If this be not worth a Senates grave advice, What can be Sir? Theoph. My good Lord Chancellor, I do believe all men will think my griefs Must equal be to yours, the cause being so, I'am sure this wretched Life I would give up To see my Daughter and her honour safe: But yet I think her yours, and hundreds more Not worth the time we vainly spend about them: My Lord, by your advice amongst the rest The Empire lies at stake: first think of that, And mony 'tis, if any thing can save it, All Councels that retard that, scarce are honest. Chanc. Honest! 'twas scarce well, said the Senate sitting, I'm sure of that, for they're of other minds, And 'tis but fit we wait their Resolutions. Card. Certainly your Majesty cannot do better Then follow their advice; they're the great Council, They represent the whole, what they conclude, You may without th'least fear of blame pursue. Emp. Blame! my Lord Cardinal, you are not my subject, And so perhaps do erre through Ignorance; But good my Lord, learn this,âI give account To none but Heav'n for any thing I do: I take advice 'tis true, but still am free To act as I see cause,âCouncil does cease To wear that name when it can be Coercive; So know my Lord, I fear no Earthly blame, No, not the Popes. Then use some other word. Card. Sir, I ask Pardon if that word offended, I can be sorry too, but yet that shan't Make me neglect my Duty to the Pope, Whom you were pleas'd to name with too much heed; As I conceive, I have no bus'ness here, Except you think his Holiness on Earth, Heaven's Deligate. Emp. In Heavenly things I do; In Earthly, though he has no more Dominions Than what our Royal Predecessor gave him; And if he seeks more here, 'tis Labour lost. Thom. I'm glad his Eminence hears this Truth From your own Sacred Mouth; he still believ'd None but my self durst boldly urge the Point, My Enemies I'm sure made him believe so. Chanc. Your Highness I'm afraid mistakes your friends, Your best and truest Friends, for Enemies; I humbly am afraid, I say, you do; For I believe there's not a Grecian breaths, But does admire you justly for your Virtues, Your sollid Prudence, Constancy and Vallour. Thom. Spend not your breath my Lord, in long harangs Of me, for all you can say, wont Make my Opinion jump with yours In your this Dayes debates.â Emp. No certainly, To urge the stop o'th' Empires main concern For private Grievances, as if you did Design the Turk shou'd win it,âthis is Truth. Chanc. I'm sorry that your Majesty thinks so; But I have hopes the Senate yet will clear me. Thom. Those hopes are Insolent! I said it Lordâ Chanc. I hope, my Lord, my candid Actions will Set me in former favour with my Prince, And clear to all the World my Innocence; So humbly begging Pardon, I'le retire. Exit Chan. Card. I wish your Majesty may do the best. Exit Card. Theop. This Chancellor, your Majesty does find, Disturbs, if not betrays your weightyest Councils. Emp. He plainly does them both; yet at this juncture It is not safe to take the Seals away, For fear the Senate think their love to him Does move me to it. Thom. Let him keep them, Without the Princes favour those are useless. But Sir, the time requires, that with resolves Becoming Majesty, you press the Senate For speedy Aid, and till that's done, command That no debate beside be enter'd on. Emp. No Emperor, ever Raign'd, had a less mind To place harsh Rules on Councils than my self; The Freedom of Debates should be preserv'd If it were possible in every Council, Much more in that of highest Dignity; If not in time we ne're should hear the Truth, As these common Rules must be laid by; New Exigents must make new Presidents, And ignorance only still Cries out for old. Thom. Sir, your affairs are at the last extream; The Senate if they please may help you much; And I am confident the major part Wou'd singly quit their lives to do you service; That which prevents them, are some subtle heads, By specious doubts and questions puzle them. Your Resolution must undo this Charm. Emp. Brother, in this I do concur with you, Nothing but their extreams shall make me so, They'l either guide or force all I shall do. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Enter Irene in Mans Cloaths, with the Boy. Irene. Thus far we are well; we've past two Courts of Guard: Dear Child, how many more dost think there is? Boy. There's but one more before we get toth' Court. Irene. Sure this is not the way; although't be dark, Yet I've some little guesse, and think these Lanes Do rather lead toth' harbour then the Court. Boy. No, I'le warrant you, do but follow me, I soon will make you safe. Enter Lorenzo, and Michael dogging. Irene. 'Tis so; that is the end of St. Sophia Street. Child, thou mistakes, this is the way I'm sure. Lorenz. That must not beâwho goes there?â Exiturus. None speak, who are you there I say? Mich. 'Twas no body. Loren. I'm sure there was, it seem'd a Womans voice, And comming from my Lord, I hope it is not The beauteous Lady we had Pris'ner there, Her losse would ruine him. Mich. Come, come, there's no body; let's hast home to bed. Loren. No, I will watch this Street for halfe an hour, I'm sure 'twas some body design'd to passe. Exeunt aside. Guard without. Who goes there? Loren. Friends. Guard. What Friends? Loren. Friends to the Guard, and Servants to the Lord Chancellor. Guard. Come before the Captain of the Watch. Boy. The Grand Round's coming; haste! we're undoneâ Irene. I'le follow theeâbut know not what I shun. Enter Thomazo and Soldiers as in a Grand Round, with them Michael and Lorenzo. Lorenz. Our Lord's not come from Court, and we were going To wait upon him there. Thom. The Councel did sit late. Mich. Your Highness has no commands to honour Your humble Servants with. Thom. No, none at all. Exeunt severally. Enter Irene and Boy. Irene. Where are we now? I've follow'd thee so fast, I had not time t'observe which way we ran. Boy. No, I, I'm sure, nor know I what to do, I've lost my self, and shall be Ruin'd by it, I wish I ne're had medl'd. Irene. What say'st thou Child? Come, I will save thee harmless: Let's knock at the next house and take a Guide. Boy. No, no, they all know me, that were the way To be Surpriz'd, and carry'd to my Lordsâ Stay you here, I'le search about for the way. Exit. Irene. How terrible to me this darkness seems! That and this Habit both do give me fear, And yet they both must prove my greatest Friends. Unusual things, though Innocent, amaze us. I'm near the Strand: I hear the Water roar As if the Waves sought to o'recome the Shore; This joyn'd with Solitude, the Night and Fear Makes all my Danger double to appear; But who are these? Hides herself. Enter Michael and Lorenzo looking about. Lorenz. If she be gone, we'l use the Boat our selves, It is no staying, she'l betray us all. Mich. 'Tis a strange Diligence in Prince Thomaz, To walk the Round himself. Lorenz. To meet with us in St. Sophia-street was damn'd Unlucky too. Michael. Would that was all, But thus to lose our prize, makes me stark Mad, Let's to the Barge, perhaps they may inform us. Exeunt. Irene. These are the Villains that the Round did stop, And Prince Thomazo too it seems was there: Oh! my unlucky Fear that made me fly From such a Sanctuary that was so near me, Their words seem'd darkly to reflect on me, And on a Boat; I hope I am not betray'd. But where should be the Boy, he stays thus long? I am affraid, in seeking out his way, He's slipt into the Sea: Heavens guard him from it. Enter Boy. Boy. Hist! hist! Irene. Here, here! oh, there has bin two men Came talking by: Two of the Chancellors Servants, They seem'd to speak of me and of a Boat. Boy. Which way went they? Irene. Down this Street. Boy. That's our way; I now have found it out, Come, let's make hasteâ Irene. No, let's go any way rather than that. Boy. We must go that, there is no other truly. Irene. I tell thee, Child, I'le rather seek Thomazo, He's on the Round, I wish I had not shun'd him; Come, let's up this Street. Boy. Stay a little! What shall I do? how unlucky 'twas I went That they should miss us thus,âI'de better kill her, I'm sure, than she should meet Thomazo, That must not be then: but I will trifle time; Perhaps they may return. Irene. Come Child, what look'st thou for? Prithee let's go, This way I'm sure does lead to the higher street, And that way to the Sea. Boy. No, I'm confident this is our way, And I must go no other; Pray come then. Iren. This Boy Surprizes me,âI will go this way. Boy. You shall not take my Cloaths along with you, I am sure of that, if you will needs be going, Strip and deliver them first. Iren. Prithee Child, let me perswade thee. Boy. No, no, give me my Cloaths, and go where you will. Iren. You know I want my own, and they're much better; Put up thy Sword. Boy. No, no, go back toth' house, and take your Cloaths, But on you shall not go if I han't mine. Iren. I have a Sword too, and sure, methinks his strength Should not be more than mine; Come, Prithee Be rul'd, and go this way, I have a Sword else, And twice the strength of thee; but I am loth To do thee hurt, if thou wilt put up thine. Boy. No, I will not, except you'l go this way. Irene. Nay, then there's more than Childish thoughts Does prompt the Boy: To this a greater fear Must drive away the lessâ Come Child, be rul'd, I still am loth to hurt thee. Draws. Boy. Nay, if you come to that, do what you can, You shall not steal my Cloaths: I must gain time, yet I'm loth to hurt her. They fight aukerdly, and at a great distance. Enter Lorenzo and Michael. Irene. Boy, you see your Sword can do no good; Then trust my word, and go along with me. Boy. If I had thought you'd ha serv'd me thus, I'd never have helpt you, that I wou'd not. Lorenz. How's this! They're hereâ Aside. What, Men a quarrelling? Mich. No, on my life meer Boys, Ripe Soldiers I'le be Sworn; what is the Quarrel? Boy. Let him tell it if he will. Iren. O! I am lost, these are the Murderers, The Boy will certainly discover me. Loren. Young Gentlemen, here take your Swords agen; What would your Quarrel be? Rivals in Love! Mich. Ay, for a Paper Kite, or some such thing: What, will neither of you relate your Quarrel? Boy. Our Quarrel was about the way to Court, He said 'twas that; and I affirm'd 'twas this. Loren. Then he was in the wrong, and ought ask pardon. Irene. I do with all my heart: Pray, Sir, forgive me; What a good Boy is this that still conceals me. Mich. We just came both from Court, Yet will go back a little way with you To set you right, that you sha'nt miss it after. Boy. I humbly thank you Sir. Irene. And so do I; But I still doubt this way, I know not why? Exeunt. Enter Synan and Calista. Synan. It was a strange neglect you and your Father Both made, in not discovering this Dorello To be a Lord o'th' Council: I'm afraid 'Twill cost his Head; but I have given him notice, He is gone back, and on what Errand too. Calist. I hope his Wisdom soon will find away To clear himself, and place all guilt on him: But good my Lord, how stands my great affair. Synan. Madam, as you wou'd wish to morrow Night, The Sultan does intend you for his Bed, Therefore adorn your self with all your Charms. Calista. My Lord, this Obligation is so great, That no sufficient thanks can be repay'd. Synan. Yes, Madam, but it may; for tho we Eunuchs Cannot be Lovers, yet our other Passions Grow more unruly by our loss of that, As Deprivation of one Sense, does double The Vigour of another: so Ambition Oft gives hopes, fears, fruition, and despair To us, more violently then Lovers feel them, Then when you shall possess the Sultans heart, This passion of my Soul you may indulge. Calist. Next pleasing him, it shall be all my Study, And let me be despis'd by the Great Sultan That hour I fail to be your faithful Creature: Thus I must talk till I possess my power, Then I am free to act as I see cause. Enter Mutan with a Letter which Synan reads. Synan. Go, bring that Person in that brought this Letter; Madam, 'tis from your Father. Enter Messenger. Tell me Friends! how did the Youths you brought Behave themselves? Messeng. One Sir was quiet, to'ther shew'd a sorrow Approach'd near Madness, oft, if not prevented, He had leapt over-board to drown himself; Thus he continued 'till our Boat was boarded, By one went hence to Town; in that there was A Christian the Boy knew, and whisper'd with; On which he did produce a large Commission Under the Sultans Seal, and sign'd by you, Pretending he had power to take him from us, But all in vain; our Orders were too strict, So we refus'd obedience, and have brought him. Synan. You have done well, keep them without a little, Ex. Mess. and Mut. This desperate Youth he talks of is Irene, And he that would have seiz'd her, is Dorello, None else have had my pass: What's to be done? Calist. Sir, if the Sultan sees her, I am despis'd: Her charming Beauty will eclipse mine quite. Synan. But how shall I prevent it? Calist. If you would Oblige me to the full, then tell the Sultan That she is lost by'th' way: her Sex conceal'd, As I perceive 'tis yet, will make the Story Above all Contradiction, but by me, And for my own sake, I shall never clear it; This way you may secure my happiness, And place about his Person your own Creature. Synan. I will devote my future life to you, And hazard all my Fortunes on your Game; But how shall I conceal this charming Beauty. Calist. Deliver her to me, as a Boy Sent you by some mistake, her fears will then Prompt her to keep conceal'd. Synan. Well, I'le prepare herâ Exit Synan. Calist. Now base Thomazo, I'le Revenge thy scorns Upon the Person of the lov'd Irene: She and Udoxia both shall feel the smart Of an inrag'd Love, and led by despair, Yet still my powers secure, I must dissemble: This Synan Bassa has a Soul too honest To be Assaulted with my great Designs 'Till I'm above his Arts to keep me out, But that once brought about; then my great Soul, Shall freely have it's swing without controule. Enter Synan with Irene Synan. Your Labour will not be much, Madam, this Boy Sent me, I know not why, here I devote To do you serviceâ Ex. Synan. Calist. My Lord I thank you, A pretty Boy indeed; your name sweet Youth. Irene. I had not time to make it! Oh my Fate! To be condemn'd a Slave to her I hate. Calist. What are your Blushes, Feare, or Modesty, Dispence with both at present; tell your Name: Irene. My Name's Thomazo. Calist. Heaven's she mocks me! But oh my Rage, be still till I can feast Thee! Where were you Bred? and who did you belong to? Iren. I've hardly wit enough to answer; Madam, My over tender Friends childishly Bred me, And I'm afraid 'twill Kill my Aged Father, To find that I am lost: If you have goodness But equal to your Beauty, 'tis excessive, And sure a just Request you can't deny. Calist. It may be not, but tell me what it is, Your Complement does strongly plead for you. Irene. Madam, it is you would prevent the trouble An unexperienc'd Boy will hourly give you, And send me back agen to my poor Father. Calist. That must not be, you are too fair to part with; I like these Childish looks; This pretty Face Must not Adorn it self with Blushes thus, They do assault a heart too hastily; Part with such sweetness! Every word that begs it Stroaks &amp; plays with Irene. Is a new Charm to strengthen a Denyal; I'le fetch a Glass, we will compare our Faces. Exit Calist. Iren. It is no wonder Prince Thomazo gain'd her Upon his first address, since she can thus Court me, yet think me all the while a Boy. Enter Calista with a glass. Calist. Come hither pretty Rogue. That Nose of thine Would match this Face much better, Those Plump lips Methinks I cou'd Steal tooâI needs must kiss 'emâ Irene. Good Madam, pardon me. Calist. So very Coy! That pretty Chin I likeâbut for my Eye I wou'd keep that, my Eye-brows too and Forehead. Betwixt thy Face and mine might sure be made A Beauty that wou'd Captivate all Hearts; Let's try to make one such. Thy Innocence Can do no harm in Bed; come thou and I Wont part till both get better Bed-fellows. Ex. Calista. Iren. Prodigious Impudence! This goes beyond The worst invented Stories of our Sex. Ha! Enter Calista and Udoxia. Calist. Perhaps Irene will own her self to you, To me she seems all man, and Courts me too. Irene. Pardon me, Madam, that I durst not own A Person I wisht lost to the whole World. Calist. What to Thomazo? Irene. Las, that Name I took In too much haste, I know not what I said. Udox. But can this be Irene? Iren. Dear Friend, it is, The much surpriz'd Irene to meet you here. Calist. Did not Dorello tell you of us both? Iren. How Madam, can you know he met with me? Calist. I do forget my self, you came but now. Udox. But what in this disguise has brought you hither? Iren. How we're all here, I know not, but Calista, I fear your Father has been much too blame. Udox. But I'le amend his Fault, by keeping you From being seen by any person living, 'Till you are safe got back. Iren. If this prove true, Her worth will my Aversion quite subdue. Exeunt. Enter Emperor and Chancellor Discoursing earnestly. Emperor. This to my Reason seems incredible, Yet to my sence is plain. Chanc. Your Majesty Will sure perceive my Innocence by this, And what just grounds I had for all my Fears. Emp. I know not what to think, but sure he cannot Be so unnatural, as this does speak him: Ill men begin at first with petty Crimes, And dare not by degrees lanch forth to great. But he at one great leap from good to bad, Seems to love mischief in Extremity, And scorn to mount it's top by graduation. Chanc. Sir, to be near, and yet but near a Crown, In Souls like his move strong Agitations. Emp. What shall I say to it?âI cannot thinkâ But he will soon be hereâDorello tooâ I scarce have Faith enough to doubt of his, But to believe an only Brother Traitor, And Traytor to this heightâI cannot do'tâ Chanc. Sir, as you please for that. I charge him notâ Alas he is too great for me to Cope with, But I had rather much his Power should Crush me; Ay! Crush me into nothingâthen that you Who are my Soveraign Lord, and such an one To whom I owe all that is Noble in me, Shou'd seem to hazard life, and Empire both, By any fears of mineâ Emp. What shall I do? Cannot a Prince be merciful and safe? 'Tis very hard I findâthis wicked Age Does almost think there's no such thing as goodness, And villifie all Persons that profess it; If Princes pardon Crimes they count it weakness, And if they punish them 'tis Tyranny. Enter Thomazo. Thom. Sir, did you send for me? Emp. Ay Thomazo! But 'tis to tell you that which does amaze Far more then Anger me; Cannot you guess At what the matter is, and spare my Tongue The trouble to declare such unkind things; I wish you would Thomazo. Thom. Your Majesty Shall not find it hard to know the greatest secret My mind can labour with. Emp. Then tell me Brother, Have not some late transactions done by you, Or by Dorello's Ministry at least, Bin of that Nature, well nigh cause my Anger. Thom. Commented on by Enemies they may, And I suspect no Friend was so officious To tell you my design. Chanc. I do perceive I'm some restraint upon the Princes Candor, Therefore shall take my leave. Exeunt Chanc. Emp. And can you Brother Wish Empire without Glory? Thom. Sir, I know not What 'tis your words do tend to? All I know Or have transacted that might trouble you, Has not the least Reflections towards Empire. Emp. Then tell your Reasons Brother. Thom. Sir, the Cause I kept my Passion secret, was for fear Some scruples in your own or Senates Breasts Might have prevented that, which when once done, I knew you soon wou'd Pardon. Emp. Pardon Brother, What, think you I'm so tame to Pardon Treasons, That ware so black a Visage? Thom. Sure no Law Does limit my free choice of any Wife, Under so high a Penalty as Treason; But if there was, the Merit of Irene Wou'd strongly plead I'm sure in my excuse. Emp. This Love you own, I never did dislike, Though I suspected it; but 'tis not that Has brought me to this Parly, but worse matters. Thom. Sir, I am ignorant of any thing, Besides my hopeless Love can move your Anger. Emp. Nay, Brother, you shall see 'tis not slight matters That have oblig'd me to this unkind Parly. Enter Messenger. Bring in that fellow thereâfriend, tell your Story. Messeng. Sir, as I said before, being employ'd Toth' Turkish Camp about Intelligence, I there have heard them say, that Prince Thomazo Must be Morea's King, and that this Town On that condition, he will soon give up. Thom. Sir, can you credit Slaves, hir'd to accuse me, Of such impossible designs as these? Villain! who has suborn'd you to say this? Emp. Be patient till you hear his Story out. Thom. I sooner might be patient when hot Pincers Were tearing off my Flesh. Emp. But I commend you. Thom. Then silent Sir as Death, I'le hear my honour Be blasted by his Breathâand never murmur, No Sheep shall fall more tamely Sir then I. Friend, say all that the Chancellor has taught you. Messeng. Sir, what I've said, and what I am to say, My Senses all must Witness is most true, Though in the least I do not accuse your Highness; What I have said, I heard i'th' Turkish Camp: I didâand what I saw there, is to followâ Which is that oft at Synan Bassa's Tent, I've seen the Lord Dorello in great favour, And Courted by the Bassa, but last Night He did come back to Town in a disguise; For meeting in their Fleet we boarded Boats, And though he knew not me, yet I did him; I saw him there produce a large Commission, And shew it to the Turkish Admiral, By which he had full power to close with you. This Sir is true, as I have proof enough. Emp. Return to your Confinement for a while, You nor your Fellows sha'nt be long restrain'd; What think you of this Brother. Exit Messenger. Thom. Sir, I think That Vertue which you Worship proves an Idol, An empty name, less sollid then a shaddow: Oh deep unfathom'd Villanies of State! Through what strange Mazes do you wind your selves, That honest men cannot find Clews to trace you.â Emp. What a sad Fate have Princes that are born To bare the Fate of sinking Monarchy; Those actions which we judge will prop it most, Produce its speedier Ruin: Faction grows And spreads it self through Councel, Court, and Notion, And nothing can be heard but accusations, These when we wou'd Unite for common good, They say we Cherish for our private safety; If we believe them all, then none are honest; If we give Ear to none, all will grow angry; So whether we're severe or moderate, Our Glory's hid i'th' Ruin of the State. Thom. Sir, I have thought upon't, all this seems false, But how to prove it so, I cannot guess. Emp. Brother, I'le say no more but only this, Act as you please, I n're can be unkind. Exit Emperor. Thom. What worth the keeping life for now is left? I am stript of all that's Dear, Friend, Mistriss, Brother, And of my Honour too!âwhy live I then? Because I am a Christian! Surely though That cou'd at the first teach Contradictions, What were most Martyrs but Self-Homicide? What severe Hermit too but shortens life, Why then 'tis plain I'm Master of my self. By best Rules of our Philosophy:â But some will hold 'tis Cowardize to die For fear of Misery!âWhy then I'le live; Yet scarce my self, my self alive shall know: In strict retirement my few hours will spend, And by sharp Abstinence my life will end. Exit. Enter Emperor, Theophilus, Chancellor, Cardinal, and Justiniano, who kneels and Kisses the Emperors hand. Just. Sir, I with thanks receive my Liberty, And shall discharge the Duty of my place, With all the Zeal that may be since I hear You have laid by the Prince. Emp. My Lord, I wish You'd place a greater Guard upon your words; It is not I, but my unlucky Stars Have for the Empires ruine laid him by. Just. Sir, you shall see it's stronger prop If you will find away to pay my men. Chanc. My Lord, you do offend his Majesty, In speaking of the Prince with such contempt; You had best attend your Charge, and leave to me The getting of your Pay: The Emperor Is put upon a project to get Mony And you shall find your share. Just. My Lord, my men Wont Fight one stroak without it, that I tell you. Ex. Justin. Chanc. Nay, good my Lord, no more, Your Majesty Should not regard his Folly but his Courage. Emp. Courage! Each private Soldier may have that, 'Tis Conduct only makes a General; And I suspect his much, for all your Pray'rs; But I'le not long endure his Insolence, I'le rather hazard all on my own person. Chanc. What means your Majesty? Emp. Why Fame does say, This Sultan Mahomet's a Valiant Prince; I'le try, if he'l on single Combat stake The Fortune of this War. Chanc. How's this? Aside. Cardinal. Perhaps You have not well consider'd that design; Your Majesty in such a weighty Cause Must ask advice of Piety not Passion. Emp. My Lord, you speak as if strong Appetite Did make me seek this Combat for a pleasure, But I'le assure you 'tis on no such Cause: Thank Heav'n I dare, but do not love to fight. Card. No Sir, nor must not singly; Heaven's strict Laws Deliver'd by the Church, does quite forbid All Duells under pain of highest censure. Emp. Surely, when Heav'n gave Sacred Characters To Clergy men; it did not then divest The rest of Mankind of the use of Reason; Did it my Lord? Card. No, not of common Sir. Emp. Common! I understand no such distinction; Reason is Reason, and that does plainly say, If I i'th' head of Thousands may make War, And hazard both my own and others lives, I sure much more, may singly do the same. Card. Not without dispensation from the Pope, As humbly I conceive. Emp. The Pope, good Man! No Dispensations from his Officers, 'Tis they must have a Fee: These tricks of Rome, Of first forbidding, then dispensing things, Has Rob'd it of the Reverence once it had, From best Advisers to Mens Consciences; They now are grown to be their Torturers, Things in themselves indifferent they make sin; And real sins they dare give leave to act: A man may be a Saint and Traitor both, When Dispensation frees him from his Oath. But trouble not your self Lord Cardinal, I'le ask the Sultans Dispensation only, If he consents, I'le not refuse the Fight. Enter Dorello like a Doctor. What have you seen him Doctor? Dorel. Sir, I find, Except you Majesty in person goes, His Servants dare not let him be disturb'd. Emp. How do they say he is? Dorel. They do believe, As I have said; it is a Lunacy Sprung from an over-tender sence of Honour; But still I'd undertake on pain of Death, Were I but few days with him, I wou'd awe him. Emp. Come, we'l go visit him, his Health wou'd bring Me Vigour to our ne're expiring power, Ex. Emp. &amp;c. Chanc. Pray Heav'n he be but Mad, I'le never fear This cheating Quack from Persia e're can cure him: He'l sooner Poison him I'le undertake, And that part of his Art I'le try him in If I can fix him wellâbut stay this Combat The Emperor designs, and I do fear The Sultan may accept in thirst of Glory Must be prevented; 'tis too much to stake My utmost certain hopes upon one Throw. But sure I need not fear, the fair Irene Will keep him from that Danger. Enter Michael. Mich. Noble Sir, New Letters from the Bassa, say his Master Doth Dote so much, that he forbears all action. Chanc. How's this? I fear the Love he bares Irene May make him raise the Siege. Mich. I fear it too. Chanc. Well, something must be done that may prevent it, Can you learn nothing yet of this Dorello? Mich. Not any thing, my Lord! Chanc. Sure he walks Invisible! That Danger Did threaten most of all, and yet my Stars Has brought me off with Triumph.â But stay!âThe Emperor designs to Beg Something by way of Loan o'th' Citizens; He'l find them Cursed free! Ha! ha! ha! a Beggar Prince Is such a Contradictionâbut I'le go And see the sport, I hope I shall be able To keep my self from down right laughing at him. Exeunt. Enter Thomazo, Solus with a Book in his hand. Thom. It cannot be but all that they say's Chymera, There is no sollid Truth in all this stuff; 'Tis meerly words: They'r Sinowy Sillogismes By which they puzle both themselves and us, Are perfect Ropes of Sand: If we'l be Fools To grant their first Conceptions, then they'l prove The Consequence must needs be this or that. Grant me says one an Immaterial Giant, That does reside in Immaterial place, I'le prove he turns the Primum Mobile, And that turn all things else about the Globe: Then starts another up, and he conceives, That Immaterial Being is absurd; Strait brings his Giant in to do his Tricks On good Material Leggsâthen shews a Storm Produc'd by a slight cold matter had got, Which made it Sneezeâall comes to such like stuff, Avant substantial thick Ãgyptian darkness, Throws away the Book. Rank mist of words be gone; there's nothing true, No nothing: Good and Ill are only Names Stampt by our Interests; farewell all Books, I'le Study nothing but my Misery, Enter Emperor, Card. Dorello. And how to Die apace. Ah Mighty Sir, And may I not have leave to do that neither, 'Tis all I beg; you once were a kind Brother. Emp. I've not a thought but speaks me kind as ever. Here is a Learned Doctor. Thom. What to do? I want no healthâIf you have skill, feel here, Does not my Heart keep it's Pulsation right, As right as ever, though it is just a breaking; Come wave your profit once and speak the Truth. Am not I well in health? Dorel. Your Highness is In what the Bloods concern'd. Thom. Oh, let alone The inward man: That goes beyond your Tools, Your Probe's not long enough to Tent my Soul: Sir, on my Knees I beg I may be private. Emp. From all but this one man, Brother you shallâ Thom. Then since I must be Plagu'd with conversation, I'le ask some questions: How go things i'th' Senate? Emp. Their obstinacy forc'd me to dismiss them. Thom. That was a prudent step, but how the Siege? Emp. The Turks like loving Neighbours seem most quiet. Thom. They then expect some Revolution here! Lord Cardinal, when come our helps from Rome? When I go next abroad,ânay, my good Lord, I've answer'd now my self,âyour Majesty, I hope, will free me now from all but him. Emp. Study your health, dear Brother, till you're well, My Self and Empire both do languish in you. Exeunt Manent Thom. and Dor. who pulls off his Beard. Thom. Come Sir, to work, have you a Dose of Opium, For I want Sleep extreamly,âHaâDorello. Dorel. Ah Sir! Can you endure a Traytors Breath; For so State Pamplets, and the Ballets call me; For what I do not know, except it be, That I know some are such, I must not name; But I have secrets Sir that will amaze you. Thom. Not more then does your Presence in this manner; Sure I'm deceiv'd,âon with your Beard again, So,ânow I see it only was my Fancy: But where's Dorello gone? Dor. Ah, Noble Sir, I fear you are not so well as I did hope. Thom. It is Dorello's voice too,âAh dear Friend, Wonder not I seem'd Craz'd: Alas, Irene, Is Murder'd I believe, or lost for ever. Dor. No Sir, She is not Dead, though I must fear, That as you guess she may be lost for ever. Thom. Not Dead! how know you that? Dor. I've seen her Sir, And She's i'th' Turkish Camp from whence I came. Thom. From thence I'le presently go Rescue her. Exit. Dorel. He is too near Distraction to be told Irene's the Sultans Mistriss; but I'le go And humour all his fancies till he sleeps, Perhaps some rest will make him fit for Council. Exit. Shouts without. Enter Emperor, Chancellor, Cardinal, Attendants and Rabble. Michael. Emp. Their Obstinacy makes things desperate: What's to be done my Lord? Enter Alderman. Chanc. Try a few more, here comes an Alderman. Emp. Friend, you are Rich, I'm told, and therefore shou'd Spare something of it for your Countries safety; Nay, for your own, your Wife and Childrens too; For they and all you have lies now at stake. Alder. Your Majesty is misinform'd of me; I Rich! alas Sir, I am very poor. Chanc. Consider Friend, who 'tis that goes a Begging, Your careful Emperor himself in Person. Card. Your much distress'd Prince, consider that, Give something Sir, and Heav'n will sure reward it. Emp. Friend, 'Tis not for my self I ask! Heaven knows That was't not for you my loving People, I'd sooner die then undergo this Shame: Come Sir, be liberal, that others may By your Example lend their mony freely. That so the Soldiers paid, may boldly Fight, And here I promise on my Royal Word, That what you lend I'le faithfully repay As soon as Peace has open'd Trade again. Alder. This way of borrowing Sir, I fear's Illegal Without the Senates leave,âand I'd be loath To break the Law, and make bad Presidents That might infringe the Liberty o'th' Subject. Chanc. Ay! there's the Argument that choaks them all. Emp. How strangly Friend you do mistake the Law, Am I in worse condition than a Subject? Who wanting mony borrows any where; Nay, what I borrow, I by force might take At such a time as thisâa Law there is, A Natural Law of Pow'r it may be call'd, Which gives the Prince aright to every thing He thinks may keep the Common-wealth from sinking, And this no other Law can Abrogateâ Alder. My Council does inform me otherwise, And I shall take his wordâExcept my Lord, You'l give your hand upon't he's in the wrong. Chanc. Good Friend forbare, I am no Advocate That signs my hand to every Case that's put: His Majesty expects your answer Sir. Enter Thomazo and Dorello disguised. Thom. Ha! what Mock State is this? Alder. Your Majesty Must pardon me, for I can spare no Mony. Exit Alder. &amp; Rabble. Emp. 'Tis labour lost, Heav'n surely binds their Eyes To their Destruction; but I find, my Lord, That you concur with their false arguing. Chanc. The times are dangerous Sir, I dare not speak Except in private Councilâ Emp. Princes may By me be warn'd of two much Lenity; The Rabble is a Jade, must feel her Rider, 'Tis not soft taps I see, but whips must rule her, Humility moves none but generous Souls. Exeunt Emp. &amp;c. Thom. Was I not obstinate to see Irene, I scarce could let this Traytor live a Moment. Dorel. Good Sir, let me intreat you to desist From that so dangerous and vain attempt. Thom. Dorello, say no more, I'm resolv'd To shew her I was true, though she's not so; And shou'd Death wait me in the Turkish Camp, Yet I wou'd go,âsee! how the Traytor laughsâ Chanc. I put him on this project for his Ruin; It was a subtle Myne, I knew, when sprung, Wou'd blow up all that little power he had: An humble Prince makes Subjects Insolent, Then what does Begging do,âha, ha, ha, honest Michael, Go watch how he succeeds, and bring me word. Exit Michael. Thom. I must Alarm himâ His Soul is much too jocund for a Traytors; My Lord, I have a mind to give allay To your excessive laughterâwhere's Irene? Chanc. Ha! Thom. Your Daughter too, Udoxia and Dorello, What? you to save their lives, have sent them hence, What punctual day Sir, must the Town be took? Chanc. Sure Slave you know me not, you dare talk thus! Thom. Yes, you are he, that by the help of Souldiers, Did break the Sanctuary!âthen for Reward, Bestow'd a Dose of Poison on your Slaves; You thought their Dying too a pleasant sight. Chanc. What Devil canst thou be that dar'st accuse Of Crimes so false as these? Thom. I cannot stay at present now to prove them; But in good time I may; i'th' Interim I'le step and tell your Daughter y'are a Traytor. Have you no service to the Eunuch Bassa, I'le kiss his hands e're longâ Chanc. Ho! Michael! Thom. If you'd prolong your life one day or two, You may by being Silent; but if not, This is your latest Moment. Exit Thom. Dor. Chanc. Sure this must be Some of Dorello's Instruments in Town. My Ruin is contriv'd, I plainly see, And I must be as quick in my preventions. Enter Michael. Mich. The Begging Emperor has but ill success. Chanc. Curse on him, we have worse, all is betray'd; I've bin attaqu'd by one that knows Dorello, And every thing by him that we have done. Mich. Can this be possible, and we not find him; I hop'd he had bin drown'd in his coming. Chanc. No, all my Starrs grow dull of late; I think They take no care of me, or my designes, But still my Plots are spoil'd by Countermines. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Enter Thomazo and Dorello. Dorel. The Bassa's Kindness to me still Continues, Nay, rather is increas'd by knowing me. But yet I can't prevail to see the Ladies. Enter Mutantrope, They sign to one another. But see your little Traitor,âis your Tongue Cut out?âit is no matter, you deserv'd itâ Nay, you do well, to own your fault, There is no trusting such a Rogue as you. If I had any businessâwou'd you indeedâ Then let me see Udoxia, or Calistaâ How! Calista in such favour! where's Irene then? Thou art a lying Rogue, I still perceiveâ Oh Villain, dar'st thou swear so false a thing? As that the Sultan does not know Irene?â Thom. Can only such a Traitor speak the truth? And all Man-kind be lyars? yet, methinks The vertue of Irene, does make me hope it. Dorel. If this you swear, be true, then bring my Friend And me to see IreneâIf you're forsworn Expect a greater judgment then you haveâ Well, wee'l try your faith. Ex. Mutant. Thom. The Boy is strangly earnest; sure he cannot Be such a Villain to invent all this? 'Tis possible the subtle Chancellor Contriv'd, that Fame might say it was Irene, Lest his Intelligence might be suspected. Dorel. I can't tell, what to think; there's no design The Boy can haveâis worth his Perjury, Except he wholly does delight in False-hood. Thom. To see Irene, and see her true, will be Some few Degrees beyond felicitie. Exeunt. Enter Synan. Synan. She threatens now: what a rank Ass was I To bring ambitious Beauty 'bout my Prince, This Poison is for Ireneâ I'm confident,âbut Lady look about you, We Statesmen have our tricks; 'tis well I did not Inform her Father that it was her self, And not the fair Irene the Sultan dotes on, Did he but know it, we soon should have bin here: His Politick Pate wou'd still Solicite Bowstrings Might be presented us, that vacant places Might be dispos'd by him,âbut to his greif, Both he and all men else, think 'tis Irene. Enter Calista, Irene, Udoxia, and Mutes, one Carrying a Cup of Poison, th'other Bowstrings. Calist. No! I'le cut off my fears, their hopes and thine All at one blow. Synan. Consider but the Crime! Calist. No Synan, you mistake that charming Face Which in dead colours first bewitch'd my Lord, Shall not remain for you to shew a line, From that design Springs all your Piety. Synan. If you fear that, then spare this other Lady; Why Madam, must she dye? Calist. For sweet revenge, She did upbraid me, with my Fathers Nature And now she'l find I have it thoroughly. Udox. I will not lose a Pray'r to ask thee Mercy, Nor will I live after Irene is Dead. Calist. You shall never doubt it. Irene. Ah Calista! Think of the pleasant hours we three have spent In Childish sports together,âcall to mind How both of us have strove which most shou'd please you. Calist. Plead not our wanton Childish Tales to me, I am a Woman, and do see the Danger Of that bewitching Beauty you have got, Therefore make haste and chuse your way of dying. Irene. Save but Udoxia's life, I'le call that Mercy, And with my dying Breath beg pardon for you. Udox. Irene, ne're speak of that, give me the Cup, I do defie all kindness from the Monster Except you share it tooâ Calist. Bravely Resolv'd! But do not drink it all, one half will serve; I try'd it on a Slave, and he dy'd calmly, Made no ill Faces as some people do. Iren. Come then, let's take our everlasting leaves Of all our Sorrows here,âmy thoughts begin To prompt me it is brave to leave this world, And all it's flattering, false, and painted joys, Which do allure to real Miseries. Udoxia, lead the way. Udox. Farewel Dorello. She drinks and gives the Cup to Irene. Iren. And farewel now for ever my Thomazo. Drinks. Calist. Curse on his Name, it staggers me a little; But Love Adieu! and Tryumph my Revenge! In thy first ConquestâFarewel Play-fellows. Exit. Calist. Synan. Sure 'tis some Bodied Fury this, not Woman; Ladies, you'l find your Deaths steal gently on you Like a soft Sleep: but yet to shew I wou'd Do any thing was in my power to serve you, I'le send the little Traytor, Mutantrope To find Dorello out, and bring him to you, Udox. May Heav'n reward your Charity, my Lord, It is the only thing I'd wish on Earth. Synan. You shall not fail of thatânow Mustapha, Our Plot is Ripe to ruine this Medea. Exit. Iren. Whither, dear Friend, are thou and I a going? Udox. To Heaven Irene. Irene. Heav'n is a great way off, And though I doubt not, we shall soon reach thither, Yet Nature shudders at the world of Miles That Fancy says is thitherâAh Udoxiaâ I hope we shall know one another there. Udox. I hope soo tooâyet, what the pleasure is Which happy Souls enjoy, I cannot guess, But sure it won't be any thing like those We do enjoy on Earth. Irene. Ay, there's the fright; Methinks we're about to lose our selves, And change to something else. Tho' what we know not? But we shall ne're be We again I fear. Udox. Yet this we're certain of we can't be worse. Enter Mutantrope, and observes them, then Exit. Enter Dorello and Thomazo. But see the Boy! I hope Dorello's coming. Dorel. It makes me happy I'm in your thoughts. Vdox. I'le own that nought on Earth could be so welcome. Irene. Nor to me neither except Prince Thomazo. Thom. That word in spight of Fortune makes me happy. Iren. Ah! do I see you Sir? Then welcome Deathâ faints away. Thom. How's this! Irene! paleness sits on her lips. Dorel. The sudden Joy o'recame herâgive her Breath, She'l come to her selfâ Vdox. Never on Earth. Thom. What dreadful word is that? it pierc'd my Soul! Vdox. The strange Surprize did make the Poison work. Dorel. Poison! Vdox. Ay Sir, Calista Poison'd her. Dorel. Ah Horrid Deed! but see the Prince Sir, Sir, I fear his Soul's not proof against this blow. Thom. Irene so Angry, that she will not speak! Ha! Poison! Never! I will not have Calista, Her Father is a Traytorâbut Irene Is the great Sultans Mistriss,âIs she so? Then I'le turn Hermit in a Grove of Willows, Berrys of Baleful Ivy shall be my Food, And the Drink nothing else but my own Tears! For fair Irene is false. Dorel. Ah dire mishap, His scarce Cur'd Lunacy agen returns: Great Sir, Irene is Vertuousâ Thom. Then I'le have her. I will my Self destroy the Sultans Army, And Rescue my Ireneâto horseâto horseâ Draw up the Guards and follow,âsound a Chargeâ What do you Run you Dogsâ Draws &amp; exiturus, is held by Dorello. Dorel. Oh, good Sir stayâ Discover'd once, he will be lost for everâ Thom. What are you that take me Prisoner? I won't have Quarter now Irene is lost. Dorel. Look on me Sir! do not you know Dorello? Thom. Ha! where's Irene? Oh! there, She's thereâ Have I recover'd her?âI thank you allâ You have Fought bravelyâyou shall all be Knighted. But won't Irene speak to her own Thomazo? Pardon me, Madam,âby all my Love I thought Kneels by her. 'Twas you I shou'd have Marry'd. Udox. Ah poor Prince! Dorello, look to himâbut if you can Procure our Bodies Christian Funerals, I know hers does, and I hope mine deserves it. Dorel. What mean you, Madam? Udox. I find the Poison works on me apace. Dorel. What are you poyson'd too! Udox. Ay Sir, Calista Was kind in that, to let us Die together. I can no more! Farewel, my dear Dorello. Enter Calista and Mutes. Dorel. I envy not the Prince! why do not I Learn the same Art to lose my greif in Madness. Calist. What men are these, seize on them; ha! Thomazo Dorello too! They seize them, Thom. stands amaz'd. Dorel. Ah thou cursed Monster! What Devil taught thee all this Cruelty? Calist. I learn't it of that Prince, he taught me first To find my Nature badâI else had liv'd A puling vertue, still frighted with tales Of Hell and Devils, with other silly Bug-bears; But seeing him the stout and brave Thomazo, The Wise, Just, Generous, and great Thomazo, Take pleasure to betray a harmless Maid: This taught me rage, and rag'd instill'd revenge, Which made me do this petty triffling mischeif; But that's not half enough, since above my hopes, You two are fallen thus into my hands. Dorel. Ay, dare thy worst; as for that noble Prince, Were he but safe, Death were to me favour. Calist. Nay, you shall both together! Slaves your strings. Mutes put Bow-strings on them. Thom. Though I'm a Prisoner; I'le Wear no Chaines but those of faire Irene! Dorel. Irene is Poison'd! Poison'd most Noble Prince, by this damn'd Monster. Thom. Ha! 'tis the Devil Dorello, 'tis the Devil: He has Calista's shape, but 'tis a Devil, He cannot hurt me though, for I defy him; Ha, ha, ha,âsee! how the Devil weeps Because he cannot get his will to hurt us. VVe are too honest for his Mischief,âlet me go, I'le make him vanish with a Vengeance hence. Calist. Oh! I could chide my Eyes for shewing greif, Tho' tis a Killing sight.âThomazo is Mad! How came he thus Dorello? Dorel. Can you ask? And see Irene lie Murder'd there by you? Calist. Oh I wou'd rail and call him if I cou'd, Ungrateful, base Thomazo. But this sight Renews agen my Love, and stops my Mouth. Dorel. Talk not of Love at all, much less for him, That is too good a Passion for thy Soul, And he a Cause too Noble. Calist. Ah Dorello! Judge but from whence proceeds this Flood of Tears! Dorel. They're such as Crocodiles by Nilus shed. Calist. Nay, rather such as once Medea did, When she dispers'd her tender Brothers limbs; Love taught her Cruelty, and I perceive 'Twas that, and not Revenge has Murder'd these. Dorel. If cruel hearts, like yours, be capable Of Love, yet all you have the Sultan claims. Calist. The Sultans Title sprung from my Ambition, But now that Passions cloy'd, and Love returns. Dorel. Madam, why do you pause? pray give me death, Vdoxia chides my sloath for staying thus. Thom. starts up. Thom. Ha! Sir! I am no Traytor! I'm your Brother, Ask Dorello if the Dam'd Chancellor Be not the Mighty Traytor of your Stateâ But see his DaughterâShe shall be Sultaness.â I will have none of herâShe is a Monsterâ See seeâhow she's besmear'd with Blood, But where's IreneâAlas! She's angryâAh meâ I will have none but herâ Dorel. Alas poor Prince! The fair Irene is Murder'd by Calista. Thom. Ha! Murder'd! Irene Murder'dâthen Calista Shall be torn Limb from Limb by horrid Devils! Her Soul shall turn that fatal Bird of Night, With Crokes and Crokes for sad departing Souls. SONG. In Caves full of Sculls, and rotten old Bones, He Sings. She Sighs in the Day-time, and in the Night Groans. 'Mongst Ghosts of the Guilty, for ever She'l howle, And in Beds fill'd with Serpents eternally Role. But I and Irene will be Merry, Amongst happy Lovers we'l Play, Ah Charon! make hast with your Ferry, Row hard, and I'le double your Pay. Irene we'l part no moreâ Falls down. Calist. Why do you pause upon't? he in his Madness shews His lasting hate to me, and Love to her; Revenge is rous'd again by Jealousie, And now I wish him Dead; Passions in me Like Tides in some great Rivers, flow not in, But first in heaps of Water take their view, Then Roar, then tumble in Mountains of Sea, Devouring Shores almost as quick as thought; So now your times are come. Dorel. I do rejoyceâ Calist. Your joy shall be but short, pull Slaves! Enter Synan. Synan. Hold Doggs!â Calist. Synan! how's this? dare you controul our orders? Synan. Not but by his; whom you your self obey. Our Mighty Sultan saw and pitty'd him. Calist. Oh I am lost. Synan. No, Madam, I am so without your Mercy; And 'tis 'gainst me alone his Rage is bent, For thus deluding him about Irene: But save my Life since for your sake I did it. Calist. No Synan, if thy Fate depends on me, Thou must expect a dreadful Destiny. Synan. I see my Deaths inevitable now! But I am glad my life does Ransome yours. Dorel. You cannot give us life, in them we die. Synan. That Death will but continue till they wake. Dorel. How wake! my Lord! do not despise our griefs. Synan. 'Tis but a sleepy potion, which they took, Which I prepar'd to save them from Calista. Dorel. My Lord, my Lord, you grieve without a cause For fair Irene's not dead; This noble Bassa. Who knows no falshood sayes it. Thom. What is that? Dorel. Irene is living Sir. Thom. Ay, but She's angry, She won't speak one word to poor Thomazo. Dorel. Sir! she's a sleep! Thom. Ah do not wake her then! Husht! husht! no noise, I pray let her sleepâ She will be pleas'd anonâsteale softly outâ Softlyâsoftlyâdo not wake her for the world. She's Dreaming now of poor Thmazo's love. Exit softly. Synan. I must admire the wayes of providence, That strangely thus by wicked mens designs, Does oft protect the justâyour Chancellor To fortify his greatness in our Court Has caus'd your being here, where you are safe, Which else you cou'd not be in our next storm: For then the Town's betray'd: The General Has promis'd to march out with all his Souldiers, And there's a Royal Half-moon Banner sent To th'Chancellor which will protect his houseâ Dorel. Good my Lord, Let not the Prince hear this but by degrees, His Brother and his Country's loss will be A Greif his worthy mind will hardly bare, Shou'd he recover this which now assaults him. Synan. My Lord, you freely shall command this place Whilst I have any Breath to give that power, And after that, you safely may relyâ Upon our Sultans friendship to the Prince, Which I dare say is reall: But I must Make hast and meet that Death now stays for me. Dorel. My Lord! I hope much better. Synan. No, my Lord! Our Sultan's Frowns are Mortal; they'r met by this To be spectators of my Tragedy. Carry the Ladies inâwhen I am deadâ May you, my Lord, and all your Friends be happy. Mutes carry in the Ladies. Dorel. My Lord! farewell; may Heav'n preserve You stillâ Exit Synan. But yet I fear he's lost: Vertue on Earth Is like some wholesome Herb o're grown with Hemlock, There is so little, men can hardly find it, And all that use it are unfortunateâ Exeunt. Enter Emperor, Theoph. Chancellor, Cardinal, Attendants. Theoph. This Information puzles my belief, I sooner shou'd have doubted my own Faith Then Prince Thomazo'sâsure it cannot be. Card. The things too evident for any doubt; Hot spur'd Ambition in a Young mans breast Ne're boyles at a Crime wou'd give it Checque. Theoph. But sure the world must end, when Crimes like these Are boldly Acted by the best of men; Vertue has spent her utmost stock on Earth;â Vertue, that Cement of the World, grows loose, Then Nature sure must shake into its Chaos. Irene to turn a Strumpet, did Amaze me! Though she's a Womanâbut for Prince Thomazo To make a base Revo't, is Miraculous. Emp. What can an Emperor, bounded and ty'd By Laws, Act more than I already haveâ But Heav'n and all things else conspire our Ruin, What can we then more but resolve to Die; Story shall never say I did neglect My personal Duty to the very last. Chanc. No, Mighty Sir, had the Revolted Prince, And others of his Faction, but bin faithful, You might have shin'd in History, as great, As does that Constantine who first Raign'd here. Emp. Heav'n strangely brings its great Decrees about A Constantine, whose Mothers name was Helena, Began this Empire: The Bishop of this See Was Theodotius then, so all are new, Both, and State must sink in the same names As founded them; but let Heavens will be done. Card. Dispair not Mighty Sir; the ways of Heav'n Are past all finding out, who knows but you May give a new beginning to this Empire By driving back this faithless Mahomet. Emp. I for my subjects sakes, perhaps could wish it, Though for my self a worthy death is best; Which I have sought from Mahomets own hand By single fight; but that he basely waves With Crowds of bleeding slaves he snatches glory, Which flyes from me, who court it still in person. Enter Justiniano. Justin. Sir I am come once more to ask our Pay, Which, if deny'd, we presently will March. Chanc. Now it begins to work! Aside. Emp. Do as you please, My subjects obstinate to all entreaties, Deny me their supplies; and I'm resolv'd Rather to perish with them, then extend My Regal pow'r beyond its usual bounds: Blinded they are, and blinded let them be, Since they love Gold beyond themselves and me. Justin. Bare witness all, that 'tis no fault of mine This Empire sinkes: I could have propt it yet; And with this single Arm sustain'd it's weight, Had not affronts upon affronts at first Disarm'd me of the power to wish your good; But I'le not stay to bury all my glory Under your mighty ruines; no, my Sword, When you are nothing but the name of Prince, Shall give me the full power of being soâ Theop. Sir; will you patiently endure this slight! Emp. Let him, and all the world grow insolent; It shall not move my rage: My Brother's Crimes Have stupify'd my Anger. Enter Captain. Capt. Mighty Sir; The perdues do fly in the Turks advance As if they did intend a general Storm. Emp. All that dare not be Slaves, now follow me, To certain Death, or glorious Victorie. Exeunt. Enter Thomazo and Dorello. Thom. Dorello! sure I'm deluded still And this I feel's another sort of madness, Is it not so, Dorello? Dorel. No, my Lord; Your cause of joy is sollid, like those Cares, Whose unexpected sounds, distemper'd you. Emp. Am I then known, and in the Turkish Camp, Yet free from Chaines? and does Irene still live? Nay, live for Prince Thomazo! this, Dorello, My sickly fancy wou'd perswade is true. Enter Synan. Dorel. For all these mighty Blessings, next to Heav'n, We owe our thanks toth' noble Eunuch Bassa, I wish his safety were as firm as ours. Enter Mutes with Calista's head. Synan. Thanks to that hearty wish, and so it is; See there the head that lately threaten'd mine. Thom. Oh wonderful! Calista's head cut off! Synan. Ay noble Prince! our Sultan has deceiv'd us; But to our satisfaction, for just now Mounted upon a Throne in full assembly, He did expose this Beauty to our view, Seeming to glory in so rich a Jewel. And had his praise Eccho'd back by us: Then Beckon'd me, I went and kneel'd before him, Thinking my self a Victim to her Triumph, And she believ'd it too, for big with joy, Her Eyes roll'd Grace to all; but scornes on me, When in her height of Pride, one sudden blow Given by the Sultans Sword, took off her Head So quick, she cou'd not shreek one Pray'r for Mercy: Then throwing me the Headâcry'd, Synan take it, And smiling, bid us see, how much he valu'd True Glory above Beautyâbut the Storm Will presently begin, and I must thither, And be an Actor in this Scene of Fate Which will Create our Sultan Emperor. Thom. Are you assur'd my Lord the Town will yield? Synan. Nothing more certain Sir, the Town's betray'd, But Heav'n has so contriv'd that you are safe: Farewell most noble Lords; if I am slainâ Think of meâIf I live, I'm still your Servant. Exeunt Synan, &amp;c. Thom. Ah Dorello, 'tis not for us to live Beyond our Princes Ruin. No, Brother, Thomazo's Love and Fortune shall give way When's Honour, or your safety is in question; Come Friends, let's once again Enter the Town, And leave the Ladies here, they'l still be safe, What e're becomes of that, or of our lives, Though Dead in them, some part of us survives. Exeunt. Enter Emperor, Theophilus, and Attendants with Swords drawn, They pass over the Stage in hast, great Clamors and Noise. Trumpets and Drums beat a Battle. Enter Chancellor, Lorenzo, and Michael, like Turks above. Chanc. The sport's begun, that noise which dreadful sounds To others Ears, to mine seems sprightly Musick. Day breaks apace, as soon as we perceive The Town is taken, hang the Banner out. Loren. Shall we admit of such as seek Protection? Chanc. No, not the Emperor himself shall enter; Let them e'en take their Chance. Shouts. Oh, that was brave! Cries, and running o're the stage, all's lost, all's lost. Hang out the Banner strait, the Town's our own? The Banner hung out; Enter Christians, drove in by Turks. Enter Emperor, Theoph. &amp;c. Who make strong Fight by giving way. Enter Thomazo and Dorello Fighting, and driving off the Turks. Lorenz. See there! the Prince Thomazo and Dorello Are Fighting on this side. Chanc. I'm glad of that, This forfeits all his favour with the Turk, And 'tis not in his Pow'r to save the Town. Enter Emperor, Thomazo, Dorello, Theoph. Emp. Brother, your Loyalty does bring a joy Beyond what Victory it self wou'd do. Thom. Ah Royal Sir, there is no time to talk, Our Men can never hold the ground we gain'd; Were but your Person safe, I wou'd not Care. Emp. 'Tis safe whilst Guarded by your Noble Sword, And mine I hope shall prove a Guard to yours. Thom. Sir, 'tis in vain to hope to keep the Town: Then take this time to save your self by Flight, Whilst I make Head against the Entring Turks. Emp. How Brother, Fly! No, it shall ne're be said That I surviv'd a loss so great, as is So brave a Brother, and an Empire too. Thom. Sir, be not obstinate! but see a Flag That speaks Protection to the Chancellor, Open your Gates my Lord, and take but in Your Emperor and Theophilas; such a Deed Will make Atonement now for all your Crimes. Emp. I will not hold my Safety from a Villain. Chanc. No Sir, content your self, you come not here, Nor any person elseâmy Crimes, my Lord, Are got above the punishment of Heav'n. Shouts and Clamors. Emp. Infamous Renegadeâbut the Noise Calls loud for our assistanceâ Exit. Thom. Come, Dorello, Let's Keep him safe as long as e're we canâ Ex. all but Theop. Theop. Blasphemous Traytor, are thy Crimes so great? Thou thinks the pow'rs above han't strength to punish! Chanc. Talk not my Lord, I for your Daughters sake Will let you singly in, and save your life. Theop. No cursed Dog, I'd sooner find my Death From my own hand, then owe my life to thee. Exit. Chanc. Nay, if you be so brisk, e'en take your Chance! What insolent Slaves are these? Enter Cardinal. Card. Oh my good Lord! Let me but find protection in your House! Chanc. Alas my Lord, your Eminence on foot! 'Tis a great way to Rome; you had best make hast, Spare Complements to meâyou have my leaveâ Card. My Lord! mock not my misery. Chanc. You'l be belated truly, wanting Horses, My Duty to his Holiness, and tell him, I've ended now this long continuing Schisme To his own hearts Content! Card. Impudent Traytor! A noise! Enter Christians retreating. Chanc. See see, the Cardinal has lost his Goutâ Ex. Card. runing. Enter Emperor, Thomazo, Theoph. Dorello, and Guards Fighting before the Turks. Emperor falls Dead. Thom. Oh Heavens! the Emperor's Slain, preserve his Body. They Fight. Enter Synan, who fighting falls. They are going to Kill him. Thomazo prevents itâ Accept your Life from Prince Thomazo Sir, As part of recompence for all your favour Sir. Synan. Most noble Prince, persist not thus in vain To stop the Current of our Victory, Which will at last flow o're, and drown you all; You, and those you shall chuse, shall on my honour, Be safe from either Death or Slavery.â Thom. I've nothing now to fight for, but my self, Since this brave Prince is Slain, therefore I yield To be a Prisoner to Noble Synan. Syna. Christians, put up your Swords, this party shall Continue as a guard about your person, But that they may be safe, I will appoint Some Janizaries that may joyne with them. Thom. Your Favours all are large! Syna. Lord Chancellor, The Sultan does require your person shou'd, shou'd, Be brought before him straight. Chanc. With hast I'le fly To Kiss the Foot of our great Emperour. Exeunt. Enter Irene and Udoxia. Udox. What various changes have our miseries? Irene. 'Tis better sure we had for ever slept Then onely wak't to a more grievous Death. Udox. See yonder! how the Flames ascend the Skies, Seeming to melt the Heavens. Iren. O sad sight! This is the Prince Thomazo's Funeral Pile, And I ungrateful, I don't leap into't, But I'le not long survive thee, noble Prince, For in a Flood of Teares I'le drown my self, Thus from two warning Elements we'l meet Above; yet keep an everlasting Peace! Udox. I yet could Chide, methinks their gallantry That cou'd expose both us and them to ruine, In such a needless danger as they sought. Irene. No 'twas their duty lead them to the fight, And I do love Thomazo's flame too well, To wish him safe with loss of any honour, Though to revive from Death, and meet him well, Then straight again to lose him, seems severe. Udox. Ha! what vision's this! Enter Thomazo Theop, &amp;c. Theop. Do I see thee alive, and vertuous both? Can Heav'n bring joy after these fatal losses! Irene, our Prince is slain and Country lost. Irene. Did not the thoughts of that suspend my joy, To see Thomazo and your self alive, I scarcely should be able to support it. Enter Synan. Synan. Great Sir! the Sultan has commanded me, To greet you with this stileâKing of Morea; For with that Kingdom he does now invest you, Under the tribute of an Annual Horse. Thom. Your Princes's soul's as large as is his Empire, And I with grateful thanks receive the guift. Synan. That action which I fear'd would raise his anger Increas'd but his esteemeâHe said, you could Have found no better way to perfect glory Then this last act of fighting for your Brother: And it has strengthen'd much his Friendship to you. Thom. How shall I e're express my gratitude For all these Mighty Favours he bestowes. Synan. The riches in the Town are found prodigious; Though basely they deny'd their Prince assistance; For which 600000. Thousand Souls and more Forever must intoâCaptivityâ As a just reward for their Disobedience! Only he does permit you shall set free Ten thousand of such Persons you best like; The Chancellor and some few other Traitors He only does except: For they must die A just example to all future times; He further does intend a Noble present For this fair Lady; whom he dares not see. Thom. He is a Prince of such a mighty Soul; Vertues in him contend for Victory, And each of them in turn do gain a Triumph. Synan. The Execution's doing on the Traytors! A noise of groaning. Step but a broad and you may see the Train. I'le go and cleer, and standâ Exit. Theop. Fame certainly does spread abro'de 'Twas you the Sultan kill'd. Irene. That errour does arise because we were Ne're seen by any person but the Mutes; The Sultan, and two Bassa's, since we came, And Fame does still report I was his Mistress. Thom. Let fame be still a Lyar, my Irene, And say, 'tis thou art Dead, so I can thus Admire thy living Beautiesâbut let's go And see the Sultans justice upon Traitorsâ Exeunt. The Scene a great Number of Dead and Dying men in several manner of Death's. The Chancellor, Lorenzo, and Michael Empal'd. Within. Make way there! Make way. Enter Synan and Mutes, Thomazo, Dorello, &amp; the rest. Theoph. What a sad sight is this? Dorel. This is a severe extension of his power. Thom. This Turkish way of rule threatens the world, As if their Crescent would at last be full, And rule it all. Synan. This is the way to govern: Severity, not Mercy, strengthens power. See there your Chancellor and his two Scribes. Thom. I pitty them, though they deserv'd far worse, For ruining their Country, whose sad Fate, We during life shall Mourn, yet in our Tales We must your Vertue, and the Sultans praise, And Monuments of Thanks for ever raise. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
