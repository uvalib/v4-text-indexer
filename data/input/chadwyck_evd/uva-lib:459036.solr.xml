      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF OVID.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Most highly honoured Cosin CHARLES COTTON Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Epigramme to the Authour, upon his Tragedy of OVID. Long live the Poet, and his lovely Muse, The Stage with Wit, and Learning to infuse. Embalm him in immortall Elegy, (My gentle Naso); for if he should dye, Who makes thee live, thou'lt be again pursu'd, And banish't Heaven for Ingratitude. Transform again thy Metamorphosies In one, and turn thy various shapes to his. A twin-born Muse in such embraces curl'd, As shall subject the Scriblers of the World. And, spite of Time, and Envy, henceforth sit, The ruling Gemini, of Love, and Wit. So two pure Streams, in one smooth channel glide, In even motion without Ebb, or Tyde; As in your pens Tyber, and Anchor meet, And tread Meanders, with their filver-feet. Both soft, both gentle, both transcending high, Both skil'd alike in charming Elegy; So equally admir'd, the Lawrell's due, Without distinction both to Him, and You. Naso was Rome's fam'd Ovid, You alone Must be the Ovid to our Albion: In all things equall, saving in this case Our Modern Ovid has the better grace. CHARLES COTTON Philodramatos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Pyrontus, A young Lord. Philocles, His Friend. Bassanes, A young Lord. Marullus, His Friend. PhÅbianus, Pyrontus his younger Brother, called also Caralinda. Hannibal, A Banish't Italian Captain. Cacala, A young Fellow, His man. Publius Ovidius Naso. Dacus, A Getick Captain. Clorina, Bassanes His Bride. Armelina, Her Sister. Cypassis, A Bawd. Spinella, Her Daughter, A Courtezan of Tomos. Floretta, A Roman Courtezan. Maskers. A Spectre. Servants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Tomos, a City in Pontus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. A many famous Poets do not refuse, With Prologues t'usher in the Tragick Muse: The Reason (Gallants!) I presume to say; To Tomos, you are welcom all to day. For fear (lest when y'ave seene't) you should repent Both of your Mony, and your Time misspent, I tell you (though our Play is new) tis writ, After an ill old mode, with litle wit: For in't there is a Divell and a Foolâ Such sights as Boyes affect that go to School. This said, you have our Leave (with out Offence) To take your mony again; And to go hence. Nothing of Ovid then! Enough, Enough: Dancing and fighting; And much amorous stuffe. If any of these invite your stay; Pray know We hope to please you; whether you will, or no: But (if you shall dislike it) Gentlemen Revenge your selves, and never see't agen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi, ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Pyrontus, furiously, intending to fall upon his sword, and Phylocles after him, who with his foot strikes it away. Pyrontus. Uncivill man begon, before my rage Increases above my troubled patience; And I for this untimely Courtesy, Make thee to harbinger my Soul, in death. Phylocles. Alas! My Lord why will you take away The noblest Life that ever honour'd Pontus? I pray you think upon't. Pyron. I am resolv'd, Nor will I live to see Clorina made A wife to any man besides my self. Phylo. Ah! who would not run mad, and tear his haire, And weep untill his eye-balls did dissolve, To see the bravest man of all this Land So passionate; And for a scornfull Lady? Pyron. Kill me Phylocles: Thou wilt do a deed The gods will love thee for; for I am One Ful of those things that virtuous Souls abhorre, Else sure Clorina would not use me thus. Philo. To my own death to do you reall Service You may command me readily (my Lord): But to entise me to advance my hand Against your Life; Great Jove! and all the gods (Whom we do reverence and fear) forbid. Pyron. Phylocles, dost thou love me? Phylo. You know (my Lord) I do above my Life. In our late wars when we did aid our Friends The fortunate Romans, I attended you. And when your Horse's Fall left you a Prey Unto the barbarous Cruelty of the Parthians I, careless of my life, ran to your Aide And brought you off through many of their deaths. Command me any thing, so you except Your noble Life, and I will do it freely. Pyron. Aswell except you will not stirre a foot To do your friend the greatest favour for him; Which with an ease, so easy as is walking, You may perform. Phylo. What would you have me do? Pyron. Begon my Phylocles. Is this a day For me to honour with my Life, wherein Clorina slighting all my years of service Which I have paid to her with as great fervour Is any of our Priests adore the gods) Till give away her self unto Bassanes? Away my Friend, and let me dye. Phylo. My Lord I will obey you on condition That I may find you, as I leave you, safe. And (till I see you next) untoucht, and living. Have some hope I may bring comfort with me, Calme all these passions, and create a Joy That, may occasion Triumphs in your heart Pyron. Go then, my Friend, and prosper; but be sure Thou dost not trifle with me. Thou well knowst The nature of Pyrontus is averse To suffering of Abuses. Phylo. I am gon With hope to bring you Comfort speedily. Exit. Pyron. False Tyrant Love! I would I had thee here, With thy own bow Ide shoot such passions in thee As should be over-strong for thee to bear. Fond Boy! Ide make thee doat on chaste Diana And pluck thy Golden Feathers from thy Wings To write with them Repentance to the world Which of the Fatall Sisters did provoke Thee, careless of mans happiness, to do Those bloody deeds which thou art famous for O that I knew her! And when I am dead Ide pass the dreadfull Waves of Phlegeton But I would find her, and destroy her too. Upon Ixion's wheele Ide torture her Till with her balefull Cries she did awake The Porter Cerberus from his drowsy den, Then would I give her body, unto him And he should eat it, and she be forgot. But, cruell Love, hadst thou bin kind to me And equall fire raysd in Clorina's breast, Not only in Tomos, but throughout all Pontus I would have raised Altars to thy praise: Where night and day (whilst Time make Night, and day) I would have had such Anthems carrol'd to thee By happy Lovers; that, eternall Jove Should have wish'd himself to have been the god of love. Enter Ovid, Phylocles, and Armelina. Phylo. My Lord, The beauteous Lady Armelina Attended by the Poets Glory Ovid By the Entreaty of the excellent Bride, Are come to wooe you to your Life. Pyron. Tis a miraculous kindness, that the fair Clorina on this solemn day affords me. Had shee but pleasd t'have been so mercifull In former times, I had not drooped thus Now all the City Tomos layes aside Neglected Care, and puts on Jollity. Madam! what is the pleasure of my Deity? And thou full Soul of poetry (sweet Ovid) What unimmagin'd harmony of Comfort Bring you unto me? Armel. My Lord! if that my sister Still doth retain the least of power over you By me she doth entreat you to continue Among the Living. By all the Love you have Profes'd unto her, she conjures you t'bear The Chances of this Day worthy your birth, And all the noble Actions of your Life. Ovid. It is an unbeseeming weakness in you Degenerating from the former fulness Of all your Honours, all your immense knowledge Of sage Philosophy, and of your self Thus to captive your Reason, and become Slave to the passions of an heart let loose To the pursuit of barbarous Appetites. Pyron. Sweet Armelina! you whose every word Strikes Musick through my ears unto my Soul; You who in, your soft language have apparal'd The Commands of my goddess, must have power To make me die continually by living. Ovid. Assume a better Courage, and contemn These Trifles, which you rashly deem Misfortunes. My Lord, you are the Glory of this Country The Basis upon which not only Tomos, But the Nobility of Pontus, build Their Glories on; instructed hitherto By imitating You their great Example. A little Time may alter your Opinion Of Beauty; you may chance to see ere Long Another Lady that may please you better: And then this day you do account so miserable You in your Kalender will mark a Festival. Pyron. Peace gentle Ovid, this is blasphemy Against the Divinity of her fair soul, And that rich Heaven of happiness, her body Jove hath no Beauty, like her, on Olympus; She's nature's Master-piece, and glorifies This Angle of the world so, that I prize it Above triumphant Rome, and all the Splendours The Court of great Tiberius is renowned for. Ovid. You shall orecome Me, so you will Yourself: Say any thing (my Lord) and I will hear you Do any thing, and I will honour it; So you forbear to trespass 'gainst your Life. Armel. My Sister doth expect (if you have ever Born reall affection to her) that you should Return her word by me, that you will loose This Resolution of self-Murther, she will Love you as far as Honor wil give leave, Entertain welcomly your Company, And conversation, whilst you prove your self Delighted with her virtue. And she knows The Lord Bassanes will most joyfully Continue you within the Catalogue Of his Friends most belov'd, while you exceed not The Limits of a candid Amity, Nor attempt treason to her Nuptials. Phylo. I see a Calmnesse in your looks (my Friend!) Thanks (gratious Madam) for your pains; And may Thy Roman Gods reward this kindness (Ovid). Yet he were savage that had ears so deafe, And dull an Intellect, as not to yield To your great Reason, and most eloquent Tongue, Ovid. Your partiall Love doth too much overvalue My poor Endeavours. Hark! Musick within Armel. The Musick doth Invite us in. Pray, Glorify this Ceremony With your fair presence Phylo. Hymen will (my Lord) Owe you a blessing for it. Ovid. Light a more Auspicious Torch, and (for a Courtesy So timely given) crown your more happy head With future bliss above your Hopes. Pyron. Lead in. Exeunt, Ovid. I'le but collect my self, and follow you. Armel. You will oblige us all. Armelina Pyron. My Friend Phylocles! Phylo. I am here, my Lord. Pyron. Oh! how a thousand passions combate here! But which of them shall prove predominant Commands (received from my fair, cruell Mistriss) Already have determind. What strange Miracles, Great Deity of Love, are in thy power! Affection prompts me to advance my hand, And turn the Geniall Bed into an Urne. By setting this Bassanes Soul at Liberty. But I must needs recall this infant-thoughts; Or an inglorious stain may fix upon My Reputation. He was ever noble In all his Actions to me, and we Have long ago contracted such a friendship, That it hath been look't on, as an Example Worthy an Imitation. Besides, he Was never made acquainted with my Love. He then is innocent of any Injury Committed against me; and doth no more Then I. The bright Clorina be affects And so do I, and so must all the world That are not blind, or senseless when they see, His Starres befriend him: All those Eyes of Heaven Did look a-squint at my Nativity: And he hath far more Merit to deserve her. Come Phylocles: She is my only goddess And I must quit me of profaness too What she commands, strike no forbidden Blow. Exeunt. Scena secunda. Enter Dacus, Cypassis, and Spinella. Spi. Mother! Captain Dacus promis'd me a new Gown against this Maskque: And hath not kept his word with me. I desire therefore I may be quit of his Company? Dac. Pritty grumbling Heart! My Tennants are slow in paying their Rents, I else had not faild thee: But you are very fine as you are, Venus be thanked. Spi. That's no cost of yours. I am the more beholding to another friend. Dac. To whom? The Brides groom I warrant you, Spinella. Spi. Tis he indeed. Cypas. The Lord Bassanes was ever her noble Patron. Dac. But I hope she will loose his Bounty hereafter, Cypassis. Spi. Your Jealousy prompts you to talk thus. Cypas. After honey-moon's past, he may return to her again. Spi. You shall become more liberal, or I will shortly casheere you from my Acquaintance. What do you think, we venture reputation for nothing but oathes, flattering words, and a little foolish pleasure. Cypas. Indeed, Son, a young Gentle-woman must be maintain'd with other Materials. If she goes not fine, and cleanly, she is not fit for good Company. And if she keeps never so litle a while Ill, and it comes to be known, she may bid farewell for ever to all her holidaies; The Honorable, and Worshipfull will not care for her Embraces. Dac. Are you against me, too, mother? I had thought Madam Cypassis had had a greater kindness for me then so. Cypas. Captain Dacus! You know I have much respected you from our first Acquaintance. But you must think of performing better with Spinella for the future. My poor Girle else, will not be able to live decently, in the fashion, unless she should live more Common then I could wish. Spinel. Mother, you shall not need to fear that: for I can be married when I will. And this Wedding of my dear old friend invites me much to take that Course. Juno direct me to the best: for Venus (whom I have hitherto servd) is but an ill Tutress. Dac. Prethee, sweet Spinella, leave this melancholly Discourse. It sounds too unkindly, especially on a marriage-day. We should now talk of Love, Maidenheads, Musick, Banquets, Maskques, and so forth. Spinel. Captain Dacus. I must confess, my Genius is towards mirth indeed: But you must not then give me cause of sorrow. Cypas. The truth is, Captain, you must not be so close handed for the future. The Lord Bassanes being married, peradventure may turn foolishly uxorious: And then you must either get you better Tennants, Spinel. Or a new Mistriss. Dacus. Still in this Key! Cypas. What hath been done yet, hath been kept private. And so it concern'd all Reputations. But (now I think better on it) it is your best way (Spinella) to take an Husband, if he be worth having. Spinel. He can scarce be worse then this servant. Dacus. Pretty one, afford me better words: For I dearly love thee. And (though I never made use of my Credit yet in that kind) I will take up a new Gown for thee to morrow; on that condition I may take It up as often as I will. Spinel. Then you shall have leave to do your best, or worst. Cypas. Agreed, agreed. Tis well y'are come. Enter Marullus. Spinel. We thought Bassanes had forgotten us; but we meant (you see) to come unsent for. Mar. You might have been welcom if you had: I should have got you good places. But Bassanes is a Gentleman of his word, and hath sent me to conduct you accordingly. Spinel. I thank his Bridegroom-ship. Mar. You are angry (I warrant you) that he's married. Spinel. Not I, Venus bear me record: Much good do him with his fresh meat. He will be weary of it no doubt ere long, as he hath been with Others: So you may tell him, Marullus. Mar. And then you hope for him again? Cypas. Juno, and Diana defend. I dare swear she hath no such thoughts. Dacus. So durst not I. Mar. Nor I. Spinel. I care not what you say, you are both minded to jest with me. But, is not the young PhÃ¦bianus returned from Rome against these Solemnities? Mar. Pyrontus writ for him. Cypas. Tis marvaile Bassanes would not stay for his Arrivall. Spinel. No wonder at all: All men are so mad of a new face when they can get it. Cypas. Though often they leave a better for it. Dacus. Well said, Mother: Thou speakest Oracles, old Cypassis! Mar. With some Regret. This marriage is not yet digested by them In earnest, I must entreat you to beware of your behaviours. You are desir'd to pretend no Acquaintance to the Bridegroom. These Slips of youth are fit to be conceald. Spinel. Or Clorina may grow jealous. Mar. Tis good preventing the worst: Tis time we walk. Exeunt Omnes. Scena Tertia. Loud Musick. Then Enter, Pyrontus, Bassanes, Phylocles, Ovid, Clorina, Armelina. Bassanes. Welcom for ever to my hand, Clorina, Who long hast been the Regent of my heart. This day hath made me Owner of such Riches, (The Mine of Joyes in my delicious Bride) That I our mightiest CÃ¦sar do not envy Why do's my dearest blush? Because thy Modesty Doth see so many Beauties here Inferior To thy supremest one! But blush on, fairest, Like to a setting Sun, at the approch Of this so longd for Night, that's to determine Your Virgin Honour. Clor. Now you make me blush Indeed my Lord. Pyron. I wish you (Madam) a Life so circled in With joy, that you may never breathe a sigh: And (when you shall grow weary of the Earth) Become Jove's Dotage and be Queen of Heaven. Clor. My Lord Pyrontus. I return you thanks: And hope th'immortall gods will recompense This kindness, with an happiness transcending What ever yet you could desire. Ovid. May Heaven Propitiously smile on you with all those Bright eies that do enlighten Night and Day. Arm. I did not think this City could have showne A Multitude so gallant of both Sexes. Bassa: They come (I thank them) to grace our Nuptials. Phyloc. They come no doubt to see and to be seen. Enter Marullus, Dacus, Cypassis, Spinella. Mar. Hymen be praisd, we are come in time Cypas. Venus bless mine eyes! what a fine shew is here? Spin. Indeed (Captain Dacus) you have endeard me much We are beholding to your lusty Shoulders, That made a Pritty Lane through all the Croud. Dacus. My best of strength shall evermore attend. To do you service. Mar. Here let us keep together This is the best Room that is left. Pray tell me How do you like the Bride? Do not her eies Dart subtle rayes, such as may kindle fires Within the breasts of all mankind? Spin. I do not know how some may love heart-burning. Cypas. It is a Pretty Lady, but I have seen Some faces that have seemd as well. Mar. O Envy! Madam Cypassis, where beseech you? Dacus. I hope Spinella would be loth enough To change with her. Spinel. I am not yet a weary Of mine own. Bas. It doth grow late, and time they did begin Ovid. They only waited your Commands. Mar. That's Publius Ovidius Naso, the chief Poet Not only of Rome, but all the mighty Empire. Cypas. I know him well enough, and was acquainted Many years with him, ere I saw this Country. Ovid. May Musick bring Some Deities from Olympus-Top, to grace. This Night's Solemnities. The Maskers all attir'd according to the Fancies of the Ancient Poets. After a Flourish of loud Musick, Enter Hymen, Cupid, and Venus singing. Ven. I smil'd with eies, that darted rayes Of sweet desire on either's face. Cupid. And I such shafts did put in ure As only they themselves could cure. Hym. And I Love's best Physitian quickly found; Each others hand might heal each others wound. Ven. May they dissolve in love, yet prove No Diminution by their love, Cup. May they their fears and pains requite, And spend (in such revenge) this night. Hym. What ere they do, they may with ardent Zeal; For they have Licence under my great Seal. Enter Mercury. Merc. Jove hath commanded me to let you know You shall not want a grace that Heaven can show. By virtue therefore of my sacred Wand Juno, and Pallas, hither I command; That they (with Venus) may again contest, To whom belongs the Golden Apple best. And Paris (by my Caduceus Power), I charge to come from thy Elizium Bower. Now let thy doom meet the just will of Jove And thou shalt feast with Deities above, Forgo thy Solitary shades, and sit A judg upon Olympus for thy wit. Enter Juno, and Pallas. Pallas. Wherefore are we thus summond to appear To humain view? and to these Mortals here? Juno. I hope Jove now will not disturb our Raign, And fall in love with women-kind again. Pallas. Surely long since (Queen of the Deities) He did abandon terrene vanities. Juno. Daughter, he swore (by Dis) to me himself, He would for ever leave all amarous stealth: Yet Juno cannot but suspect the worse; He once so long continu'd such a Course. Pallas. Pallas hath often blush'd to hear Mars tell, Following his Fathers steps he did but well, My brother was too blame. Juno. Alas! my son Gloried to imitate what Jove had don. Your sister Venus was an hansome Child. Pallas. And Mars (when he was young) was very wild. Merc. Saturnia, needless, I do know your fears; Had Jove meant so, hee'd not have met you here. Paris is slow in his Approach. Sure some Fine Dreams have fix'd him in Elizium. Again I must command him to appear. Enter Paris. Paris. You need not (Maia's sons) for I am here. I had not made such stay, but was in talk, With my fair Queen in a delicious walk. Where Agamemnon, and the Spartan King, And all those many Princes, they did bring To fight for the Revenge of that fam'd Rape, Did laugh at our Discourse, not envy at. Thrice happy are those Shades, where none do bear, Those Passions that so tyrannize it here. The Grecian Chieftains have a thousand times Curs'd their own rage, that cros'd us in our Crimes: For when their wiser souls were loosned from Their Bodies (forc'd unto Elizium By violent deaths) and clearly understood, Those follies they had sealed with their blood. Amazement ceas'd upon them all. Our Troy, (Which that so fatall Quarrell did destroy.) Had flourish'd still in Pompe; All they and we Had liv'd in peace and in Felicity. And died in our own beds, had they been blest T'have had those thoughts wherewith th'are now possest. We are not jealous in those plains of Bliss: They for fruition care not, there, that kiss Hellen of Greece, and I (without dispight To Menalaus self) take what Delight, Pleaseth us there the most. Every one there, Sleights those things most they doted upon here. Our Bodies being compos'd of Elements Incline Mankind to seek to please the sense. But there our Spirits (being unconfin'd) Strive at the satisfaction of the mind. Though Souls embrace, They Organs want, and Places To raise a jealousy at their embraces: We at our old Amours do often laugh. Merc. Then you was in discourse, which I broke off? Paris. No matter (Mercury) 'tis fit I pay My duty unto Jove, and him obey: What therefore is his will? that I may soon Submit to his Inevitable Doom. Merc. You must again an Umpire be, and tell (In beauty) which of these doth most excell. Paris. My Judgment I have given, once, and why Should that again to my discussion lye? Merc. 'Tis Jove's Decree, And he (if you refrain) Will make you Subject unto Pluto's Raign, From the Elizium Plains, remove you quite, And cast you into an eternall night; (Insteed of Helen's voice) where evermore You shall hear Cerberus bark, Cocytus rore, And dreadfull Phlegeton (with horrid Noise) Torment your ears, as darkness shall your eies. Paris. I must submit. Merc. Here take this golden Ball. And give't to her that's hansomst of them all. Paris. I shall (in my Opinion) doom aright: But wish that Jove had chose some other wight. But the last time these goddesses emploid Me in this kind, it was on Sacred Ide. Why therefore here, in so remote a Town? And Countries, so far distant from mine own? Merc. Cast but your eies about this Crouded Place, And you may judge, it is to do a Grace To some in this fair Company. Hymen. To day, That generous youthfull Pair became my Prey. Cupid. But they had never been your Captives bound, If I had not compeld them by a wound. Merc. Jupiter (to do honor to this Night) Hath summond these t'appear to humain sight: And hath commanded you (before this Throng) To give that Apple where't doth most belong: Be well advis'd (after exact Survey) How you dispose the golden Fruit away. Paris. Prime goddesses of the Olympick Court, That Paris grace again with your Resort. I on my knees beg leave, that what I do For One, may not offend the other Two: Because our Poets have profes'd, that we Have been afflicted for my first decree; For thence two of you did our foes become, And hastned-on the Sack of Ilium. I must obey Imperious Jove's Command, Venus. And we to thy Arbitriment will stand. Juno. I do protest (by all my Rule above), I'le not be angry howsoe're It prove. Pallas. And, Priams son, I will be nothing stirr'd Or discontent, if others be prefer'd. Paris. Having implor'd your Mercies, Now I fall To look to whom belongs the Golden Ball. Juno hath sweet black eies, Pallas fine hair, Venus is just proportion'd wondrous fair. As I have done before, again I must, Venus The Ball's thine; And my judgment just. Gives it to her. Juno. To tax thy Doom, were but a needless shift, Pallas. Nor do We envy her the petty guift. Venus. To show there is no falling out, Lets all Fall in, and dance (before this Pair) a Ball. Juno. You and I (Trojan Prince) will lead: this sport Juno. You have been famous for, in Priam Court. Paris. Supremest goddess, you a Grace conferre Too high, upon your humble Honorer. Juno. Hymen, Cupid, and Maia's son, advance; Let's show these Mortals an Olympick Dance. All the Maskers dance. After a Flourish of Solemn loud Musick, Enter Jupiter. Merc. The King of gods and men! Haile thundring Jove! Pallas. Why hath my Father left his Throne above? Jupiter. Perceiving Venus, and her wanton Son, (To do some service) were by Hymen won From my star-paved Court, and looking down Upon the world, and (in it) on this Town, I soon espide the business: Therefore straight Summond you both to meet (this Nuptiall night) My daughter Venus here, that we might do, A Grace divine unto these happy two. How Paris hath bestow'd the Ball, I've seen: But give it me again (you amorous Queen Of Cyprus) It hereafter must not be A Trophy to the Paphian Diety. Ven. Great Jupiter, I yield to thy Command, Jupi. And I thus give it t'a more beautious hand. Gives it Clorina. Here may you flourish long in bliss, and when You weary grow of the abodes of Men, I'le fix you both (t'amaze all human eies,) A glorious Constellation in the skies. Pallas and Venus do not take offence, For she is a superior Excellence: And frown not Juno; I no more will make Converse with Mortals, for thy Quiet's sake. Hadst thou thus given the Golden Ball, I had Speaks to Paris. Made thee Companion unto Ganimed. Take hands, and dance, whilst our attentive eares Do guide our feet, to Musick of the sphears. They dance the second Dance. A Song. Hymen. Blest, and best Pair make haste to bed, The Bride still owes her Maiden-head. Cupid. There you can only find a Balm, The festring of my Darts to calm. Venus. And Youth, and Beauty may delight, In all Joyes of a Nuptiall night. Chorus. There when you shall be left alone, and Kiss, You need not envy to the gods, their Bliss. Jupiter. 'Tis time we leave these to a new Delight, And therefore Jove himself doth bid good night. Exeunt, Maskers. Bassanes. Let us to bed, my Dear: I long to lose, My self in thy Embraces. Gentle Ovid The bright Clorina, and my self shall owe, All power we have to serve you to the utmost: And may propitious Heaven encline great CÃ¦sar, To look with gratious eies, on your Misfortunes. Ovid. You both vouchsafe too much of honour to me, If you forgive the rudeness of my Muse. Pyron. I find my self extreamly ill o'th soddain And must not be so barbarous t'interrupt With any sign of sickness) the Felicities Of this Bles'd Company: Good night to all! Farewell my Lord, The happiest of mankind: Clorina too goodnight,âyou most unkind. Exeunt Bassanes, Ovid, Clorina, Armelina. Marull. Captain I do commit to your Conduct Madam Cypassis, and her pritty daughter. Iust go help the Groom to bed, and see The Bride to tast her last Virginity-posset. Exit Marullus. Dacus. I shall be carefull of my charge, Spinella, I had rather have spent my time in bed with thee, Then have been at this Maskque. Spin. So had not I with you. Dacus. I know you jest my litle Rogue. Cypas. Juno was of a demure look, and had a grave Behaviour. Dacus. Pallas had a smart cast with her eyes. I warrant you she beat Her husband, if she were ever Married, Spin. Venus indeed was the hansomst of them all. Dacus. But you are hansomer then she my pritty One. Exeunt. Dac. Cyp. Spin. Phyloc. Tis very late and time to hasten home. How is it with my Noble Lord Pyrontus. Pyr. I am undon (my Philocles) for ever. And have too tamely yielded to this March. I should have challenged my friend Bassanes, If he would not have given up his interest: And (by his fall) rays'd up my self some hope. Or lost her bravely with my life together. Phyl. My Lord for Heavens sake, cast aside such Thoughts, And (to your Aide) call generous Patience. Pyron. The Cowards virtue! O the Multitude Of those grand joyes Bassanes is possest of By this Conjugall knot! And oh the Myriads Of Miseries, my poor life is to wade through By her severe Command! were I the mighty Tiberius, and (or'e the conquer'd world) Bore Soverainty, the Empire I should sleight, And give't Bassanes for his Room to night, Exeunt Ambo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundi, Scena Prima. Enter Captain Hannibal, Cacala, and Caralinda, Floretta. Hanni. From Ostia, we have had a voyage hither, So fraught with Storms, and Tempests that I wonder The Sea-gods Cacala. The Sea-Monsters call them rather. Han. Were not all tired with using so much Rage On us: And yet you (Beautious Caralinda) Seem'd fearless of the Furies of the Ocean. Dreadless of thunder and lightning; whil'st my man This Rascall Cacala did nothing but shit, And spew, and pray; when there was such a Noise, Betwixt the Mariners voyces, and the Elements,) That Neptune could not hear the timorous villain. Caca. Sir, I did love you well: you have been bountifull On all Occasions to me, I else should never Have left my Native Country pleasant Italy, T'have undergon a voluntary Exile. But had I ever dreamt on such a Passage, Such Thunders, Whirlewinds, and such horrible Tempests, I would have taken leave to stay in Rome. Han. Although Floretta sometimes wept for fear, She did not baul, and whine like thee, Cac. No Matter. She do's not know how pretious a Thing life is. Flor. Surely I do; but well enough imagin'd, That such ungovern'd Out-cries might disturb The Company, yet not encline the gods, The sooner to deliver us from drowning. Caral. Intruth, Cacala, your fear was often times So full of Noise, the Mariners could not hear Their own voyces to attend their Necessaries But, you perhaps are valianter at Land. Han. He's every where a Coward Caralinda! Cac. I would confute you (Sir,) with all my heart, If you, and Mistriss Floretta would consent to't: Were I in bed with her, Ide prove my self, As valiant as the proudest Captain living. Han. How now you, saucy Rogue. Flor. He talkes most wickedly. Cac. I had rather do. Flor. You must go look a Mate then. Caral. Where do you mean to to lye in Tomos, Captain? Good Lodgings, here, I think are somewhat rare. Han. As soon as we came to town I dispach'd Cacala, T'enquire out one Madam Cypassis, A Gentlewoman, Of my Acquaintance in my very youth, she was servant once unto the Princess Julia. Caral. You rather should say, T'Ovid's fam'd Corinna. Han. By your fair leave, I know I speak a Truth, And were not Ovid timerous hee'd confess, He Julia veild under Corinna's Name. Cacala hath taken me Lodgings at Cypassis; Where you may hear of your humble servant Hannibal. Caral. And do's Floretta lye there also? Han. Yes marry, Venus defend else. Caral. Then you do resolve. It seems) to make a wedding on't. Han. By no means, Madam, Neither pritty Floretta. For I, are yet such fools, to slight our Liberties, Whilst we like one another wee'l keep together, And when we grow a weary we may part. The world hath other men and women enow And we are both of us yet ignorant, How soon we may affect variety. Caca. But, fear you not the gods? Are they well pleas'd, Think you, with such a life? Cacala. My Captain never Fear'd any thing. And for Mistriss Floretta What Man could do to her, she never dreaded; But how her Courage stands towards the gods I cannot say. Flor. You say too much, Cacala: And must learn manners, Or I must pray the Captain to bestow A Cudgell on you. Cacala. Sure his valour scorns Such mean employment: He disdains to touch A weapon that's beneath a sword, or ponyard My noble Captain ever was accustom'd, To give me leave to jest. Han. But you must know, Your distance to Floretta. Caca. I know it but too well; And alwaies am more distant then I would be. Caral, But, Captain Ide advise you both to marry, It is a life that is more honorable. Cacala, You are deceived, (Madam Caralinda Oun Roman Captains think there is more honour In keeping wenches, then in Marriage. Han. Out upon Wedlock: I had rather hear alarums at Midnight then the Multitude To baul Thalassis, at a Nuptials. Caral. Y'are a mad Captain, Hannibal. Han. I acknowledg it. And ner'e had else been bannisht into Pontus. But where abouts in this town (Caralinda). Do you intend to make abode. Caral. At Publius Ovidius Naso's: I writ to him from Rome, t'entreat that Courtesy, And he return'd me thither word (by Letter) I should be welcom; I have sent my servants Thither to prepare for me, and to beg His company here, that he may be my Guide Unto his house. Han. Were Ovid in his Youth He would be glad of such a Purchase (Lady.) Y'are of a tempting Beauty. He had fam'd you Equall unto his so renownd' Corinna, And he been then acquainted with your Excellencies. Caral. You shame me Captain Hannibal. I am So conscious of my own deformities, That I shall (all I may) shun publick view. Besides I know the Noble Poet hath Subdued his Passions, and is now become, As rigid in his behaviour, as the gravest Of all the ancient Philosophers. Cacala. These women such Discourse affect as if They were pure Vesta-Nuns. But they that do Give credit to them, are of a Belief That is not in my Creed, Caral. You must have leave To talk: know likewise Captain! Enjoy'd the generous Ovid his prime youth, And Flourished again in his own house, (Adjoyning unto our triumphant Capitol) I should choose to live with him. I do prize him As the supreme wit of the Empire. Whose Conversation ever was admired. Besides, I dare presume on my own Temper, I fear not the Temptations of all man-kind; And such Aversness have to all that Sex; That here (in presence of the Immortall gods) I vow (in that kind) never man shall touch me Cacala. For all your Confidence in your own Chastity, (I speak it with a reverence to your merit.) Beware of the old Game, and of the consequence, Known commonly by the name, of a Great-Belly. Caral. My Life (through all my Actions) shall vindicate My Reputation spotless. Han. Your Beauties, and unequald Qualities are Too potent charms for frail mankind to know, And not be conquer'd by so many wonders. Caca. Besides her Cloathes would set ones teeth on edge. Flor. On Shipbord she went in an homelier habit. Caral. The meanest Cloathes will serve at Sea for women: Captains in Tyrian dy'd Habiliments. And with their divers-coloured Plumes should flourish, At all times in all Places to beget Awe, and Respect, from those they do converse with. Han. Fair Caralinda, you speak Oracles: The Hearts of all the Getes here, must do Homage To your unparallel'd Perfections; They will not only own you for most beautifull, But the chief femal Gallant of the Province. Enter Ovid. Caral. Your Prayses so transcend, they make me blush. Ovid. Welcome my sweetest Cosen Caralinda. May all the gods of Seas and winds be prays'd For your Arrivall in this Country safely. Caral. Thanks, generous Ovid, I rejoyce to see The wonder of the Roman Empire living. Ovid. Oh spare to overvalue so your servant A serious Adorer of your virtues: Admire only you have found me breathing, After so many years here in Exilement. Han. Madam, because we see you in that Company We know you have an honor for, and who will Conduct you to your Lodgings, we will press No further on your Privacies; But take Our leave for this Time. May both gods, and men Bear Hatred to Tiberius, untill he Repeal the gentle Ovid. When we next Do meet, we will converse at large. May Jove Juno, Pallas, and the whole Court of Deities, Be evermore auspicious to you both. Caral. Also to me, Master; and to Floretta: What ere we do, I'de have the gods be merciful! Exeunt, Han, Flor. Caca Caral. I need not hope I shall be safe, but be Secure I shall be so, while I continue in Your house. Ovid. You (Madam) to your self shall promise All privacy you can desire: you are As secret as you were not in the world, Although your Native City you inhabite, Your name shall not escape my lips. But why (if without an offence I may demand it) Affect you such concealment, now especially When all your friends would be so proud to see you, And in this time of publick joy? Caral. Hereafter, At better leasure il'e acquaint you with My very soul, in all Particulars. Ovid. I will await your time. But when you left, The world's great Head, happy and flourishing Rome, How was Tiberius mov'd by the Intreaties Of my dear wife, and some few reall friends, That my Repeal sollicited? Caral. Your virtuous wife and many constant friends, Have not evaded any opportunity In your behalf. And (though they have not yet, Affected their desires in that Concern) They do not dispaire of prosperous success. Ovid. I have two powerfull enemies I believe, And such who block up (with their imputations) All waies of Mercy. And yet they are men, I cannot accuse my self for ever injuring. Caral. You alwaies was too noble to do wrongs Ovid. Even he that hath that cruelty of heart, To tempt the wife of a poor banisht-Man, (Amidst her sighs and tears for my misfortunes) Makes use of all the mighty Interest He hath with CÃ¦sar, still to fix me here. Pardon my passion, ye Just gods, if I Do wish one day you will requite the Mischiefs Of Cornificius. Caral. Your wife could make good Mirth with his Affection, Were not her heart so sad for your long Banishment. Ovid. Some of my Griefes I have flung on him under The counterfeit Name of Ibis. Caral. Those Curses he richly deserves. On sacred Empress the sweet condition'd Julia, Hath from the Island Trimerus, (where she Hath liv'd confin'd about these twenty years) Writ to him oft in your Behalf. But she Although she brought to him the world in Dowry) Could not prevaile. Ovid. She grac'd too much an Exile. Caral. But had much reason to solicite throughly, She being believ'd to be the fair Corinna, Whom in your Poems you have celebrated. Ovid. I pray you think not so: you wrong her virtues, Of which I only was a true Adorer. Cara. Though you deny it ne're so much, a Many, And of the nobler sort, believe it otherwise Droop not best Poet; but Courage. Ovid. Alas. My hopes sunk with Augustus to the Grave, And here my aged bones must find an Urne, Will you not see the Bridall house, although In this disguise, and sure to be unknown? Caral. I all those Inclinations must suppress: It is the will of Heaven, and not mine own, Tis time we walk. Ovid. I'm ready to attend you. Exeunt. Scena secunda. Enter Pyrontus solus. Pyron. This sweet and solitary Grove (adjoyning To our Citie's walls,) I have made Choice to vent My sorrows in: This Place that many times Clorina's smiling eies have graced more, Then PhÅbus with his beams could ever do. Happy you Trees, whose roots received vigour From the life-giving virtue of her looks: And you sweet Birds that choose this shady place, To warble forth your various notes were blest, To learn new Aires from bright Clorina's voice: And all those Beasts are fortunate, that here Enjoy the cooll shades, and the Crystall springs; The waters and the grass receiving virtue (From her rich presence) towards their ease, and nourishment Even all th'Inhabitants of Tomos choose This place to recreate their minds withall: Pan, Faunus, Satyres, and the Dryades Have not afforded me so good success. Wherefore alas! thus do I vainly taxe The rurall gods? Clorina is my foe, Else I had been as happy as Bassanes; Who is the most blest man of all the Empire, And that unparallel'd Beauty doth enjoy, Whose Loss I must perpetually lament; Whose Loss must sit so neer unto my Soul, The world will want a Cure to make me whole. Enter Cypassis. Cypas. Thanks to these Trees auspicious shades, whereby I, undiscover'd, have been made partaker Of Lord Pyrontus Love unto the Bride. I will observe (with all the curious search I may) what progress he intends to make, And hope I shall raise motives to withdraw Bassanes from the dotage on his wife, And fix his heart again upon Spinella. Enter Pyrontus, and Philocles. Philo. I have been searching for you long Cypas. Tis best I do retire, where unperceiv'd I their discourse may over hear. Philo. You should not Give such a Liberty to your Melancholy, Nor take delight in solitary walks. My Lord Pyrontus in your early youth. You was instructed (by the ablest Masters That famous Athens, or triumphant Rome Could glory in) in all the Principles Of grave Philosophy; reflect upon them And raise your self thence strength to conquer these Unruly passions. Pyron. My dear Philocles, Tis very easy for a man to give That counsell to his Friend, he could not follow Himself, were he in his condition; I want a power to perform't. The world Cannot afford me means: I must enjoy Clorina, or I utterly am lost. And therefore (though Bassanes is my Friend,) My Amity cannot enjoyn me silence I must pursue my suit, and will. Philo. Take heed: You then will run a course against all Virtue, Offend the sacred Deities, whom we Are bound by strictest Obligations, To observe in all they have commanded us. Pyron. But they are mercifull, and will forgive Philoc. But tis inglorious to commit a Crime Out of presumption of a pardon; and Your breach of friend-ship, all mankind will censure An Act degenerating from true Nobility. Pyron. These Moralls (Philocles) are cast away On me, who am so overwhelm'd in Love, I have not Reason left to practise them. Philo. But you will have sufficient if you would Take up a Resolution to withstand This dangerous passion. Pyron. Tis in vain to preach These things to me: I must enjoy Clorina, Or leave you friend for ever, I shall dye. Philoc. How this untoward Love destroyes your sense! Pyron. There is not Oratory enough on earth, To win me from the Pursuit of my love, One way or other I must get Clorina: And to invent a Means to compass her, Shall be my only study; And if I prove So fortunate as to accomplish that, I shall account my self a Favorite, The most esteemed of by the Gods. Philo. Fiends rather. Pyron. Then I shall find there is a Fate attends On Lovers; Harsh Beginnings, happy Ends. Exit Pyrontus. Philo. I will not give him over thus, but follow him. And though I have small Hopes I shall prevaile Yet I (in Friendship) am obliged to do My best to stop him in this vitious Course. O brave Pyrontus! How hath impious Love Abus'd thy Reason with this mighty Dotage! He that hath been the Glory of this Province, Will make himself, this way, the shame and scandall. Exit Philocles. Cypassis discloseth her self. Cypassis. Is he so hotly set that none beside, The Bride can satisfy his luxurie! This shall Bassanes know. Now will I work With all the treacherous Art I'm Mistris of, To raise of a Discord in their Marriage, she Is made of Flesh and blood and may prove false! Pyrontus is resolved to Court her strongly; A Gallant Gentleman, hansome as any, Perfect in amorous Complements no doubt. I wonder how he mist her, if he ever Made it his business to obtain her favour. I wish him good Success. May this Clorina Fall into his Embraces: Then my Girle Spinella it is likely may arise Into her former Favour with Bassanes. Hee's rich, and bountifull; And such are we come Unto young Women; who will loose no time And love to live in Flourish of the fashion. Enter Bassanes. Bassanes. I like this Marriage well, For now lead My Life in favour of our best of gods. I have liv'd loosely long enough, and paid My services to Venus, and wild Priapus, Juno will now befriend me, sure, and Hymen Rain blessings on my head, and Family. Cypassis. Good day, my Lord Bassanes! what alone? Can you so soon deprive your self of the Fair Sun-shine of your bright Clorina's eies? Find in your heart to be out of her Company? Bassanes. I must not be a shadow to my wife, Nor she to me: we must not evermore Follow each other; so our Loves might prove Troublesome to our selves. But say, Cypassis; That business brought you hither? Is't for health's sake That you are come to walk, and take the Aire: Or out of hope to meet me here, to tell me? Fictitious stories of Spinella's Love to me? Cypassis. I had not any such intention: Affection to the Groves, and a desire To exercise my self a while in walking, Did bring me hither. But I've lost my labour, And (as you came) was a returning home. Bassanes. This is a Riddle, Who could hinder You from walking? Cypassis. My own Curiosity, I have been listning to the saddest speech, What ever yet did pass a Lover's lips. Bassanes. Prethee Cypassis, Who had the ill Fortune, To vent his Sorrows in thy hearing? Cypassis. A friend Of yours: But tis no matter who, you are In a Condition of such Happiness That it would be an Incivility in me, To cause the least sad thoughts in you. Continue In mirth, and Jollity; And so, Farewell. Bassanes. I pray thee stay a while. I must confess I have a Curiosity to know, Who this is that you call a Friend of mine, Who can be sad now I am grown so happy. Cypassis. My Lord Bassanes! I must crave your pardon, Secrets of Love you know should be conceal'd Bassanes. I am no Common Brother. Cypassis. For old Acquaintance sake I cannot choose, But tell you any thing you shall request. Bassanes. I thank you. How doth fair Spinella? Should have enquired sooner of her health, But your discourse drew me aside from it. Cypassis. Oh! how you flatter me. I easily can Believe you have forgotten her for ever. Bassanes. You wrong our Friendship: Happiness I wish her, As much as you and she can both desire. Cypassis. He tell her so, and so again Farewell. Bassanes. Nay tell me (ere you go) what Friend of mine Is grown so Amorous, and so passionate. Cypassis. Since you will have me, think. Bassanes. I cannot guess, Cypassis. It is Pyrontus. Bass. It may be so, yet he Never reveal'd to me he was in love. Cypassis. At that I make no wonder. Bassa. Whom should he Be so enamour'd of? Cypassis. Clorina's eyes Have Beams enough a Province to enflame. Bassanes. My wife! Cypassis. The very same. Bassanes. He surely then will stifle His passion generously, and not attempt The wife of his approved Friend. Cypassis. You guess amiss. He is resolv'd to try Her to the utmost. He's a proper Gentleman, And (I believe) hath a prevailing language: You may be civill to him, and be wary. Bassanes. It is too likely. On our Marriage-night He so abruptly did depart, he gave us Not leasure enough to take our leaves; A signe He wanted patience to look on my Joyes. Cypas. I thought he somwhat suddainly was gon; But Love's a passion not to be commanded. Bassanes. What was't he in your hearing said? Cypassis. Alas! Enough: Too much. He doth deserved pitty, Philocles did surprise him, and did use His best Perswasions to divert him from So vain, and dangerous an Affection. Bassanes. Come to particulars, my good Cypassis, Conceal not from me any thing. The gods Did guide you hither t'over-hear him, Why Stand you in such suspence? Cypassis. Take heed, my Lord Bassanes! Oh, beware Of Jealousy, Tis an accursed Fiend, That otherwise your Quiet will molest, Involve you in a Perpetuity Of hideous ChimÃ¦ra's. Fair Clorina Is innocent, and of a spotless virtue, She is not accessary to his fault; If to be beautifull be not a Crime. Bassanes. I am not jealous; neither will be ever. Cypassis. A Resolution worthy your great mind, And worthy the Respects you ought to owe, And pay, unto the virtues of your Lady. Bassanes. I know her excellent body is enrich With so sublime a spirit, and so pure, That Vice dares not approach her thought Be free Therefore, and tell me all thou know'st. Cypassis. You may command me; And I will conceal Nothing from you. Bassanes. Good old Cypassis! thanks. Exeunt Ambo. Scena Tertia. Enter Pyrontus, and Clorina. Clorina. For shame (Pyrontus) cease to prosecute A suit so much beneath your Honour, and So prejudiciall to my Reputation: I must not hear you. Pyron. What a misery, To be condemn'd to an eternall Penury, And be forbidden to complain! Fair, cruell Clorina, do not so insult. Although I am most wretched, it's in your power to make me Happy, when you shall please to be but kind. Clorina. I am not of a salvage nature, neither Ever rejoyc'd at any bodie's Grief, I wish you all content, and ever did A wife superiour unto me in all things. Sink not beneath this passion of your Love. You under-valued evermore your merits, To think of me in that way. Pyron. You abuse The truest affection amorous heart did ever Pay to his Mistriss, if you think I can Efface your image in my soul. The Centre Of this vast Globe we breathe on, is not faster Fix'd then your Beauties here: Here in my Bosome They fit triumphant. Ãtna in its tornen-Entrals Doth nourish lesser Flames, then burn me daily; And yet you have no pitty for my sufferings. Clorina. Alas! what, would you have me make my self A Beast, of such an horrid name I tremble But to think of it? All the gods forbid, Would you have her, whom you have cast away Some kindness on, become an whore? My heart Trembles to think upon't. And the swift Lightning Of Blushes flies into my Cheeks. Me thinks My tongue doth burn like fire within my Mouth, Since it did mention so abhord a name. Pyront. Will you then never think me worth your mercy? Shall the vain terrours of an empty name, Condemn me to a languishing life forever. Clorina. You gods are Witnesses, that know my thoughts, I would not, by the wrack of Chastity, And proving to my marriage false, redeem Thy self from the most cruell death that Tyrant Did ever invent for his most hated enemy. Pyron. More merciless then worst of all those Tyrants! Can you refuse a Courtesy to me, Which my assiduous sevices may plead for? And such an one, as can be never known, Neither impoverish you in the least degree? Reflect upon my misery, sweet Clorina, And imitate the gods in Mercy. Clorina. Rather the Fiends, If I should be so wicked. The Lord Pyrontus (whom I heretofore Did look upon as a most noble Person, Accomplish'd with the virtues) hath declar'd Or Counterfeited himself an Atheist, to Allure Clorina from her Purity. The gods see every thing. Nature, nor Art, Can any thing conceal from them. Thoughts which Did never take the aire in words, to them Discover'd lye: And is it not far worse, To have the gods to see our Crimes then men? Could I prove guilty of so foul a fault, I should impoverish my self to nothing; A Bankrupt be in honor; which who wants Is a companion fit for such wild people, As never heard the name of virtue, Riches Are Fortune's Trifles, neither altogether To be despis'd, or doted on; but well us'd. Poor Virtue is most rich. Virtue it self Was (by the Ancients) held the great wealth. Pyron. In your Discourse you are too much Stoick: Young Ladies hearts should not so utterly Be void of all Compassion. Clorina. I must leave you, Pyron. Not without hope of Comfort, I beseech you, Let me but tast of those sweet Delicacies. You cloy Bassanes with, if it be possible He can be satiated with such delights. Clorina. I trespass on my modesty to hear you. Exit. Pyron. In a condition she so sad hath left me, Joy is become an Exile from my heart. To love and not be lov'd, is such a Curse Jove (on his Foes) cannot inflict a worse Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertii, Scena Prima. Enter, Ovid, and Caralinda. Ovid. Trasullus is a great Astrologer, I'th Mathematicks skilfull to perfection: For his profounder knowledg, the ChaldÃ¦ans Submit all to him. Caral. Therefore I have reason, More strictly to observe th'advice he gave me; And wait for the Accomplishment of the Fortune, Which he foretold me. Ovid. But fair, Caralinda! I would not have you either be too scrupulous, Or negligent. The skill which they pretend to Hath but foundation upon Probabilities: The glorious Planets may incline, but force not. We have a Liberty within our selves; Our wills are free, not slaves unto the Stars. Caral. Though I believe you; I am so superstitious. I shall expect the Accomplishment of his Prophesy. Further Discourse of it I shall forbear now, And choose a worthier subject for our talke. Tell me (dear Ovid) therefore how the Fair Bride's fairer sister doth enjoy her health? I left her (when I went to Travail) like Illustrious PhÅbus rising in the spring, Without a Cloud about his Temples, promising A bright day to the world. I left her in Her early youth, but with so growing a Beauty, That surely now tis able to work wonders. Ovid. Indeed she is a Miracle of Perfection; Nature hath prodigally bestow'd upon her All her rich gifts: she is so fine a Virgin, That I should wrong her to describe her Farther. Health dares not be so rude as to forsake her, Nor sickness so uncivill to approach her. Caral. You have deliver'd her to my Amazement: But I did alwaies look that she would prove, The Glory of this Province for her Beauty. Ovid. But Armelina hath besides a Soul, Replenish'd so with goodness, and all virtue, That were it lodg'd in any other body, It would be lock'd up in a Cabinet, Too mean for such a precious Jewel. Caral. Ovid! She is oblig'd to you for the rich Character You have bestow'd upon her. Ovid. You mistake me, I cannot speak her to her merit. You Will think (when you shall see her) I have Injur'd her; Her Merits do so much exceed all Language. Caral. We two have from our Childhood had a Friendship, And she will grace me to continue it; If she be such an one, as you have spoke her. Ovid. Ah! Caralinda I am grown too old, To be a Flatterer. Enter Armelina. Here she comes; and I Appeal to your own eyes, to be my witness. You grace me (Armelina) by this visit. You seem a Deity; And bring a Comfort To any Place you honor with your Presence. Armelina. Duty obliges me to wait upon A Person so Renowned as is Ovid, One banish'd from his Friends, and native Country And (in his Age) confin'd to our poor City. Ovid. You have a Charity equall to your Beauty, This Lady is my Cosen born at Salmo; The Place of my Nativity, you will honor me To favour her with your Acquaintance, and (As you hereafter shall approve of her) With your fair Friendship too. Armelina. The generous Ovid, New Obligations layes upon me daily. Ovid. My Kinswoman is your servant. Caralinda! This Lady is the excellent Armelina We were discoursing of, and I commending (For who do's otherwise that speaks of her, Doth sin against the greatest Truth on earth) As she came in. Armelina. Madam! I kiss your hand; And am ambitious Of your acquaintance, and Affection. So excellent a Kinswoman of Ovids Must find my best Respects, and truest Love. Caralina. Admirable Armelina! you are of A Goodness so immense, that you may cast Away of it on others an abundance, And not impoverish your self at all. Armelina. I wish Pontus had any Person in it worthy To be a Suitor to you for your love; That here you might be married, and fix. We would not loose such Graces you are Mistris of Now we have seen you once. Ovid me thinks Would joy to have so great a Comfort near him, And setled past the fear of Removall. Caralina. Madam! my stay may prove much longer then You do imagine. But let my occasions Prove how they can (you with your Curtesy, Have won so on me) that without your leave I'le not return. Armelina. You are too gracious, and have so engag'd me, I know not what to speak or think. Ovid. You saw, I will believe (in Rome) one PhÅbianus. A Gentleman of this Country, and this City. Caralina. I saw him oft, and know him very well, For he was pleas'd t'afford his friendship to me. Ovid. When thinks he of returning? He stayes long, Armelina. I can imagine he is so discreet, That he had rather live in the Metropolis Of all the world, then in a solitude Retir'd (in a manner) from the world, Upon the Confines of the Empire here: And to that purpose he hath mighty reason To choose himself (among the Roman Ladies) A wife whose matchless-Beauty shall have power, To fix him there for ever. Caral. By your fair leave, Dear Armelina, I with confidence Dare say he shortly will be here. Armel. Why pray you? Can he escape the Roman killing Beauties, And slight so much his own full happiness, As to return a Batcheler to Tomos, And here take up with an inferiour woman To be his wife. He hath too much discretion, To be found guilty of so great a weakness. Caral. You are a stranger it seems to his affection: For he hath left his heart here, Divers times He hath told me, he hath such a Mistris here, That Rome, and all the World, doth want her equall: That there is neither CÃ¦sar, King, or Tetrarch, But would elect her rather for his wife, Then be an Emperour of the Universe, And have all Mankind Loyall Subjects to him. Ovid. Who should that Beauty be? Armel. This Province, sure, Hath none of so supream an Excellency, As he to you hath intimated. Poets Report that Love is blind: And if he choose A wife in Pontus (after he hath seen, Those glorious Ladies in Tiberius Court) He will too late (by his Experience) find That he in his own Choice was also blind. Ovid. Do you not know her name he so affects? Armel. He is an hansome Gentleman, and if He comes not back debauched with the Luxuries. Of that proud City, nor infected with The vices of it, He is a Personage Of eminent virtues. Such he went from us; And I shall hope he will come back untainted, And be an honour to his native Country. Ovid. But still my Curiosity is unsatisfi'd, What might her name be, he doth celebrate With such Encomiums? Caral. Perhaps it might offend him if I should Reveal that secret. Ovid. Do not think it, I Believe (if he were here and I requir'd it) He it from me would not conceale: And I Dare pass my word the Lady Armelina Will be as private in't, as you can wish. Caral. Madam! I easily will believe, that you Care not at all to hear it. Armel. I dare not (in modesty) be so inquisitive, Ladies would have their Loves conceal'd. Ovid. Sweet Cosen! Dear Caralinda, tell us who it is. Caral. Sweet Armelina! I must needs obey, Tis you that he affects. Armelina. You jest with me, and he abuses me, To make me the subject of his mirth. Caralina. I'm sure You are mistaken much: He hath exprest Too great a Love for you, to be in jest. Armelina. There may be other women of my Name, For ought I know in Tomos or in Pontus. Caralina. If you Clorina's Sister are, tis you. Armelina. You make me blush. A better choice I wish him. Caralina. Were all the Beautifull Ladies in the world Together, and among them, he might select Freely which he should please, I know the vehemency Of his Passion such, he would take you: And you are of an Excellency so unparallel'd That he would wrong his Judgment, if he should Erre into any other Choice. Armelina. You complement too much: you Flatter me. Ovid. You do an Injury to your mighty merits Deserve the Praise of all the world. Armelina. Pray let us Discourse of something else. Ovid. Since you will have it so, Let us withdraw; And taste a Glass Of Cretane wine. Caral. Dedicate one health To PhÅbianus, and his speedy Return. Exeunt Omnes. Scena secunda. Enter Dacus, Cypassis, and Spinella. Dacus. Now we are Friends again. Cypassis. All very good Friends, Dacus. Spinella too will smile upon me. Spinella. Laugh at you also, when you deserve it, Dacus. My wonderfull old Mother! Dear Cypassis You are growen merrier of late, and it Becomes you well; makes you grow fat, and hold The Relicts of your Beauty up together: If there be any woman in the world. That doth remember the building of the Capitoll I dare pronounce tis you. I wish I had But as much mony as you have spent in Almanacks, (Reckoning but one for a year) since you could make use of them; And I Should be as rich as a Governor of a Province And have Gold Enough to make daily high Entertainments Of the best Sweetmeats, and rich Grecian wine For you, and my Spinella, and maintain her In clothes beseeming one of CÃ¦sars Family. Cypassis. Well, well Captain Dacus: For all you make a jest at my Age, you would Be very glad to live so long your self. Spinel. I think there is small reason to imagine He will arrive to such an Antiquity. His Debaucheries will shorten his daies. Beside He is so quarrelsom, that tis a wonder That he hath liv'd till now. Dac. Pritty Spinella, you steer an other Course Are tame enough, as Gentle as a Cade, And he that gives you mony cannot Injure you Enter Hannibal, Cacala, and Floretta. Spinella. You prate, you prate. Hannibal. Is the meat ready yet. Cacala. Whether it be or no, my stomack ready for it. Cypassis. It is; but we must stay for Lord Bassanes. Han. Will he be here, Cypassis? Cypas. Yes, and his friend Marullus. Han. The more the merrier, my reverent Mother. Cacala. But the fewer the better Cheare, I say. Dacus. Jove save you, Captain Hannibal. And Venus, Delicate Floretta, smile upon you alwaies. Han. Mars (Captain Dacus) be thy Friend, and Victory Sit on thy swords point, when thou go'st to battail. Caca. If Victory be of any weight, he had better Carry her behind him on horse-back through the Field. Floret. You look, Spinella, very well to day, are neatly attir'd, You meet with wealthy Servants; else you could Not go so richly clad. Spinel. You weare as good Cloathes as I; which makes me conclude that Captain Hannibal is of a wealthy Fortune. Floret. His sword hath been his mony; Tis it that hath Purchas'd him an Estate sufficient, To live in nobler splendour then he doth. But he's content without the Noise of Clyents, And a Retinue of many Servants. Cacala Serves him for man; And me for Maid. Dacus. I wish Bassanes would appear. Tis pitty Good meat (out of a Complement) should be spoyl'd Spinella. He is a Person of his word. Cypassis. And will Be suddainly here I dare assure it. Cacala. But how if he comes not this hower yet? Cypassis. We must stay for him. Cacala. I would then I were a Lord, and the better of the two; That we might go to our meat presently, and he come at his own leasure, and sit down accordingly. Enter Bassanes, and Marullus. Dacus. Long look'd for comes at last! Cypassis. My Lord Bassanes welcome! Friend Marullus! Y'are welcome too. Bassanes. You see I trouble you Cypassis. Why Seems my Spinella discontent? Spinella. Because She is not yours. You have forsaken me I have not seen you many a day. Bassanes. I shall Not hereafter be such a stranger to you. Marullus. These wenches strange Temptations are. Yet sure Clorina's Beauties, and the sacred knot Of Hymen will continue him in virtue. Bassanes. Your daughter looks exceeding well, Cypassis, She's Mistriss of a Beauty so supream It is above the rage of time, of sickness. Cypassis. Venus be prais'd, she needs no Art, and never Readd Ovids Poem of the skill of Painting, She knows not what belongs unto a Fucus: Her Face doth ever weare its native Colours. Spinel. Mother! the very thought of the ingredients Of Paint, would powerfully deterre me from it I should be sick to daub my Face with Oyntments Made of the spawne of Snakes, Spittle of Jews, And Mird of Infants. Flor. Many a Gentlewoman Of good Repute, and excellent Features also, Have not so nice a stomack. Cypas. I credit it: And have known many (who use Art themselves) Rail at it with so fine an Impudency, As if they did intend to win beliefe, To paint they such Aversion had, as they Scorn'd (with it) to adulterate their Faces. Mar. You women no Dissemblers are! He that Can live without you is an happy man. Caca. In my opinion, you Floretta had Better become my wife, then thus continue A Concubine to Captain Hanniball. Floret. I shall inform him of your sauciness: If you desist not from your suit. Know Cacala I scorn to be a wife to thee. Caca. No more You have more Cause to scorn to be a Whore Aside. Flor. What mutter you? Caca. No matter of Importance. I conceit Your conversation with the Captain hath Inspir'd you with valour. Flor. Preethee wherefore? Caca. Because you lead such an Incontinent Life; I think you do not fear the Gods. Flor. Adon; Or I will make you fear my Hannibal's Anger! Cypas. Our meat stayes on us. Bassanes. Mother lead the way. Give me your hand Spinella, Spin. And my heart. Dacus. I fear Bassanes will renew his Love. Exeunt. Could I win her affection. I would marry her And take her to Rome out of his reach, she is Cypassis only Child; And they are rich. She may turne honest after she's a wife: However Mony makes an happy Life. Exit. Scena Tertia. Enter Armelina Sola. Armelina. Ovids fair Cosen Caralinda hath Inspir'd a spiriti of Joy into me. Those Sweet words she told me of my PhÅbianus, Sunk pleasantly into my heart, and thence Disperse a Comfort unto all my Senses. Before he travail'd, she would often whisper Kind Accents in my ears of his Affection. But (though I wish'd him well) I durst not give To easy Credit to his amorous tongue. Yet from my Childhood I have had a kindness. For him, as he profes'd he had for me. His Constancy my only Comfort is; And I will pay with my Affection his. Scena Quarta. Enter Bassanes, and Dacus. Bassanes. You should not be so angry. He intended You no Affront. He had been drinking ere We came. You saw he had as much as he Could beare. Come therefore in again, shake hands And still continue Friends. Dacus. It must not be Refuse my Mistriss health! It is a Crime, Which nothing but his death shall expiate. His body goes to Atoms for't, and's Soul Whither it pleaseth surly Caron to Waft it. Have I been ever his continuall Friend, Waited on all his worst Extravagancies With my unwearied valour, and my sword? And am I slighted thus! I will rouse up The dreadfull Furies from infernall shades, To stigmatize him full of my revenge. The lasting Stars of his Ingratitude. Enter Marullus, Cypassis, Hannibal, Cacala, Floretta, Spinella. Cypassis. Il'e have no quarrelling in my house! you shall be Friends. He shall drink Spinella's health, and have no more. Caca. And you can hinder Quarrels in a Bawdy-house, you have more power then a Constable. But if you force him to drink her health; Let him have something more, have her too, though it be but to night. Spin. Leave pimping Cacala, I have no need Of your assistance in this kind, Bassanes Let me entreat that you would reconcile them Bassa. Marullus! I conjure you by our Friendship: And Captain Dacus! He shall have the Boule. pointing to Marullus. Flor. You shall command me. Spin. If you expecting favour you must leave These humours. Are you Friends? Dacus. I must obey you. Flor. Shake hands, and let us in again. Cypas. I need not of Clorina's Health enquire She cannot but be well whom you affect. Bassa. Cypassis! this is pritty Complement, She's free from sickness, and I will be carefull To keep her clear from any vitious Act. Cypas. Doubtless she's virtuous: Trouble not your head With Jealousy. Bassa. I will be wise, old Mother! Han. Come Captain. We men of Warre are for the Field, and there Will be victorious; Let the woman here. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Clorina above, as in her Chamber. Clorina. I am lock'd in, and at it am amaz'd But will conceale it from my servants while I any Excuse can find. It needs must be My Husband; For he last was with me here. I did not hear him doo't; but (in all likehood) Twas he, when's mind did run on something else. I am so innocent I should fear nothing, And yet so timerous that I am in dread. Enter Pyrontus, and Philocles below. Pyrontus and his Friend are come into The Garden: Gracious Heaven divert from The Prosecution of his suit to me. My troublesom thoughts have brought a Drowsiness Upon me. Sleep shall entertain my time Untill Bassanes comes, and ope's the door. I will not force the lock, because I am A stranger to the reason I'm made Prisoner. Perhaps my Husband knowes some Mortall danger Design'd against me, and hath thus secur'd me Till his return. Withdraws. Pyron. My Philocles, by all The Circumstances of our mighty Friendship, I pray thee vex me with no more Disswasions. I cannot look upon my Passion to, The fair Clorina as a Crime. If tis Offence on her to be enamour'd, sure All mankind that beholds her, must be guilty. Philoc. You are so obstinate, my heart foretels me You will draw Mischiefs on your head. For Heavens sake Consider on your Friendship to Bassanes, Reflect upon the Contumely, you Will bring upon you from the Mouthes of all, For your unbridled Appetite to the Wife! Of your approved Friend; and for the Breach Of Sacred Amity by such a Crime. Pyron. Your words you scatter in the wind to give Counsell to me. My Friendship must submit To my more powerfull Love. Philoc. Noble Pyrontus, Tis not too late yet to consult with Reason. Pray give me leave to wait upon you home. Rouse your depressed Vertue up, and let Time, your own Courage, and the gods Assistance, Clear your brave mind, from all these vitious Flames. Pyron. I will not leave the house till I have seen And spoken with Clorina. Philoc. You have heard She is retir'd into her Chamber, there Hath lock'd her self up; And you may believe Tis done to shun your Courtship. Will you goe? Pyron. I will not stir from hence, till I have blest My eyes with the most glorious Beams of hers! Philoc. I then must take my leave. If I can do No good with my Entreaties to my Friend. The world shall not inflict their Curses on me, As if that I conniv'd at his Impieties. I pray you come away. Pyron. All-powerfull Love, Hath charm'd me from obeying your Commands. Philoc. Farewell then; but be wise and follow me, Exit Philocles. Pyron. So let him go. I undisturb'd may now Enjoy my thoughts, and follow my own Genius. She is not sick, and yet she keeps her Chamber; And locks her self in, to my greater Prejudice. That is the window to't. Oh! For the power Of Jove t'fall on her in a golden shower, Mercury! thanks. The Gardiner hath left A Ladder here. Il'e reare it up and venture Thereby to get a sight of her; And (if I else where must not) there declare my grief. Rears and climbs up the Ladder. The window open! every thing foretells Happy success!âshe lyes upon her Bed! Looks like Diana toyld with rurall sports. Fortune hath thus far favour'd me, and I Will by her Foretop hold, and venture in. Degenerate Minds are known by Fear: And Fate Makes the audacious Persons fortunate. She sleeps! Morpheus his heavy hand hath laid, On the fair Lids of her bright eyes. Il'e kiss Them open, till those Suns appear And shall disperse those Clouds. Clorina. My Lord! Bassanes! You to Clorina are most welcom ever. Alas! I am deceiv'd: What Spectre's this That haunts me in Pyrontus shape? Pyrontus. It is No aiery Apparition, but the wretched Pyrontus self, who hath presum'd to steal Upon your Privacies. Clorina. For Heavens sake go, and never see me more. Your self you too much trouble, and expose Me (whether I will or no) to so much Ignomimy By this Intrusion, that should it be known My Reputation would be overthrown. For Heavens sake, hence immediatly retire Without a word. Pyron. Have you no pitty yet? Clorina. Have you no Goodness? No care, and no Respect for a poor woman? A Married one, and your Friend's Wife? You gods Deliver me (in safety) from this Monster. Men have exil'd all Piety from their hearts, I must not hope for any succour from them. Fie, fie Pyrontus! if you have not made A league with hell, and mischief, vanish streight, And purge your foul Soul by sincere Repentance. Pyron. Are you of so supream a Beauty, that It were profaness to compare you to The fairest of women kind (I think I may Say, Venus self doth want of your Perfections) And can you harbour so severe a mind, Within so rich a body? Give a Period To your long Cruelty, and mercy shew. Clorina. You blast me with your words, study my Ruine. Pyron. Dearest Clorina! Have a Milder thought Of my immense affection. In a body (By Nature's liberall hand fram'd to a wonder) Lodge not a soul for ever voide of pitty; Slight not my knees thus bow'd to move a tenderness, In your so long inexorable heart; Neither despise my tears; which thus I power A sacrifice to your disdain: No longer Attire your heart in Robes of Salvageness, Armour impenetrably cold. Oh! Mollify it With the Remembrance of the assiduous service That I have paid you, upon all Occasions. Enter Bassanes, and Marullus below. Bassa. Marullus! I have pas'd my word to make This Afternoon a Visit to Spinella. Mar. You will not so discourteous be I know. Your friend Pyrontus (as I herd within) Is come to see you, and is in the Garden. It seems he is retir'd into some of The solitary walkes; being out of sight. Bassa. Faithfull Marullus! I will not conceal A thought from you that doth disturb my Breast. He's to our Friendship false, loves my Clorina, And (if he hath not yet) intends to tempt her By his leud Courtship to incontinent Life. Because to day I meant to go unto Cypassi's house, I've lock'd her in her Chamber, To prevent him of his wild Aimes. Marullus. I think I hear his voice in the next Ally to us Bassa. My wife is with him: Her tongue I'm well acquainted with. Mar. It seems they are together. Bassa. Hear stands a Ladder at her Chamber window, How came it hither! HarkâO monstrous villany, He by it is got up into her Chamber: I am betraid; Marullus basely injur'd. Forsake me not (my Friend) in my adversity, Remove the Ladder saufely without noise. Watch here Marullus, that he slides not down And so escapes; And this great Trechery, (By both of them) be impudently denied. So, so, tis done without discovery. Lay it down there or any where, I now Will go and make a Third in her leud Lodging. Mar. But my best Friend! noble Bassanes! let not A rash impatience move you to say, Or to act any thing unworthy you. Bassa. You need not fear me. Exit. Mar. This is an Accident so strange, I care not Consider it without astonishment. If these the Fruits of Marriage be: high Heaven Be prais'd that I have liv'd a Batcheler. Boast not hence forth you women, of your wealths Or Beauties: For if you make no better Proof, You bring an Hell, in Dowry to your Husbands. Bassanes unlocks the door above and enters there. Clorina. My Husband's come. Oh you have ruin'd me, Work'd such a Mischief that the gods will blush at it. Bassa. Thou beast! unworthy of the name of man, Much more unworthy of the name of Friend! Thy Crime so great is, that I need not lose A Minute in hearing Lies for thy Excuse. Kills him. Dye; and go rinsh in vain thy so polluted Soul, in the flaming streams of Phlegeton. Pyron. Let my last words (for they are perfect trueth) Find Credit with you. Your Clorina's chast I here surpris'd her when she was asleepe. Bassa. He's sunk to Hell. Now my leud Huswife come: I'le find another Room for your disports, Thy unclean Body shall no more infect My Nuptiall Bed. Clorina. Protect, Oh Gratious gods! my Innocence. Bassanes. Walk in Marullus. I have suffer'd wrong: And this Adultress Justice shall, ere long. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quarti, Scena Prima. Enter Dacus, and Spinella. Dacus. I tell thee (sweet Spinella) I adore thee, Have for thee a more generous affection, Than the greatest Lord in all this Province hath. Spin. You mean Bassanes. But, my doughty Captain! He doth express his love in Golden Termes; Which I more value then a Souldier's Oathes. Dacus. He loves you for himself, and not for you Mine is a virtuous Flame. Spin. Your Dotage is, For-getfull grown of what is past. Dacus. I fain Would marry you Spin. Dacus! I am too young Dacus. Why jests my pritty wanton so? Spin. Old women that love melancholy Lifes, Are the fitst Creatures to make slavish wifes. Dacus. Have you so small Esteem for holy Marriage? And can you think it such a Bondage? Spin. Yes, Are not such yoak'd together? And oftentimes? Draw they not Contrary waies; like Dogs in Couples? The tugging at an Oare in any Gally Is as much Liberty as your Matrimony. Dac. Fie pritty Atheist. Such profaness quit And take an Husband, take thy Captain Dacus: A man whose sword shall reap the Parthian Fields, And bring thee in (by frequent victories) A large Revenew, equall to thy wishes. Spinel. My glorious talking Captain, I shall not Be won with empty words. Dacus Have you no care Of future Bliss, or Bare? Spinel. Plato, and Virgil he hath read, I smell him, And Courts me with their trim Philosophy. Dacus As you resolve to live, you do not Mean To serve the Gods. Spinel. There you come somthing near me But Venus is a goddess, and I shall Serve her. But Dacus! To be plain with you, I love a Gaudy Charriot, and fine Horses, Servants of all sorts, in rich Liveries, Delicious Meats, and Wines, costly Apparell, And Jewels of the highest value. I must Out-glitter all the Femals of the Province, Or I shall want my will. Dacus. And all this Bravery Bassanes wealth shall furnish you withall You hope, as I suppose. But (dear Spinella) Think of his Marriage. He hath now a wife Of great Descent, who brought a Fortune to him So vast, I want Arethmetick to name it: And she may look to be maintain'd at th'height Of all his Means; And then your hopes will proove Fleeting as shadows, vanish in the Aire. Spinel. 'Twit me not with his wedlock: For our Crime Will now be greater, And he shall be brought To buy his Pleasure at an higher value. Enter Hannibal, Cacala, and Floretta. The Roman Captain his Mistris, and his servant. Dacus. How fares it with my mighty man of War, Let us shake our victorious Hands in Peace, And pray to Mars to set the world in uprore. Hannibal. That Timerous Princes may grow Bountifull; Court us to take Employment on us, while Their Luxuries they may securely follow. Dacus. Brave Captain Hannibal, such iron Times Would be a Golden Age to us; shall we Together walk and drink an health or two, To all the Sons of Battail? Hannibal. I am for you. Spinel. Then I'le retire and keep my Mother Company. Exeunt Han. Dac. Spin. Caca. Gentle Floretta stay. Let me not loose This opportunity to wooe thy love. Floretta. Where learn't your folly those fine words? Caca. Your eyes have taught me to express my heart: They have infus'd a Spirit of speech into me. Flor. You have been certainly with some Pedagogue, And hired him to pen this Courtship for you. Caca. I love thee better then I love my Captain. Flor. And I your Captain much above you affect. Caca. What delicate eyes you have! I'le kiss them out, And weare them in my ears. Flor. You shall be hang'd first, I'de rather scratch thy heart out with my nayles. And stuffe a Cushion with't. Caca. To sit, and fart upon't, and keep warm. Thou art a pretious Rogue, and I had rather Have thee to be my wife, then any Damsell. That lives in the Suburra. Give me a wench In all the Gamesome frailty of her youth; Especially, wood she turn honest afterwards. Flor. Thou talk'st at such a Randam Cacala, That th'art a Pastime to me. But why rather Wouldst thou elect, a Beauty broken up Then one that's sound? Caca. To tell you the plain Truth, An honest woman is a Bugbear to me: I never took Delight in their Acquaintance. Flor. Run after your Master tell him I would speak with him. Caca. I'le pimpe no more: But will henceforth grow honest. Flor. I doubt me (Cacala!) thou hast of late Been troubled with some terrible Dreams. Hast seen Pluto, and his dark Region in thy sleep? What else should make thee talke of Virtue? Caca. The goodwill (Floretta) that I bear to you Engages me to this discourse. I pray thee Take me unto thy Husband; And we then Will run away together, leave Captain Hannibal. To his new Fortune; And resolve both of us To lead our lives Honestly for the future. Flor. Out thou villain! Turn Traytor to Master So liberall to thee as Captain is? But that I know he would frown thee to death, I would acquaint him with this Parley mend Or neither he, nor I, will be thy Friend. Exit Flor. Caca. I know not what to make of this wench, and yet I would fain Make her my wife: But I think I am a fool for my Labour. Shee'l hold her Peace I hope, That's all my Care And then to get her, I will not despaire. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Bassanes, Marullus, and Clorina with servants. Bassanes. So place her in that Chaire, and the sides Tye fast her Arms, keep her hands open thus! Here the servants tye her fast, and fasten Pyrontus heart in her hands. Thus! That she may not close them, or remove them: And put her Paramour's Heart into them: So Now Foul Adultress! Thou may'st contemplate Of the Affection it did bear thee once. Reflect upon the Mountain of thy Sins, Which hath over-whelm'd the false Pyrontus. Look Thou most libidinous woman, what a Ruine Thy Lust hath brought upon him, and thy self. Clori. I have at large (calling the gods to witness That what I told swearv'd not a jot from truth) Related to you all the Particulars Of his unruly love; that he surpriz'd me, Come in at my window whilst I was asleep; With what an horrour I was stricken at it, When I perceiv'd t'was he; how I rail'd at him, Cal'd him by the worst names that I could think on Bad him be gon for ever from my sight; That I look'd on him as a Basilisk; The Ruine of his honour, and mine own, That I would tell you of him my Bassanes, Inform you what a Divel's Company You kept I'th likeness of a Friend. Just gods! Protect my Innocency, and by some means Divine, inspire these Truths into his heart. Bassa. That wife who dares pollute the Nuptiall Bed, Is prodigall enough of Vows and Tears, To win belief from credulous Persons; she Hath done no wrong, when she hath done all the wrong. Clori. Thrice happy are those souls that from the Cares, And slanders of this wicked Age are free, Walk up and down Elizium in their thin And airy substances. And have them so Transparent that their thoughts may all be seen. Wood mine were such. Oh that the Deities Would lend their eyes a while to you, that you Might search (Bassanes) every Cranny of, My heart. I do not know a thought I have, I would conceal from you. Bassa. Thou hast a Soul, So ulcerous, Clorina, that the Prayers, And vows of all the world can never cleanse it Clor. Oh! the hard heart of unbelieving Man! Happy you Virgins that do stop your ears Against the Charms of their bewitching tongue And evermore continue in your Chastity. I would to Heaven I never had beheld Hymen to light his Pine. Have I bestow'd My self on you to find such miseries, Under your Roof? I wish my Parents had As soon as I was born expos'd me to The open Fields, unto the Cruelty Of the most salvage Beasts; or in a small Unguided Boat, left me unto the fury Of an enraged Sea. Would any Mischief Had fallen upon me, but this fatall Marriage. Bassa. Hearken Marullus! are you not amaz'd To hear her speak against our Nuptials thus? It is apparent that she doth repent her Of taking me, And wish'd she had Pyrontus. Mar. I pray you hear her out. Clorin. How you mistake My meaning, my belov'd, and cruell Husband! I would it had been pleasing to the gods, I never had been made a wife to any. How Fortunate a choice might you else where Have found; these dire Mischances mist; and I (With my ill Fate) have no man else infected. Mar. My heart is bigg with sorrow at her words, And vents it self in this sad dew. Bassa. What are these Tears for, you do drie away? Mar. I cannot choose but Melt. Bassa. You are too Tender. Come: we will leave her to contemplate here The horrid wickednesses, she hath acted. If that all sense of honour hath not left thee. Clorina, dye: It will be endless shame For thee to live, after thou thus hast brought Perpetuall Ignominy on my poor Family. Mar. I pitty her Bassanes, much commiserate Her so dysastrous Fate: She may be Innocent: I pray you think her so; I hope she is. BÃ¦ssa. Her Reputation's gon, for ever lost: A Sea of Tears cannot wash off her Guilt, 'Tis so infectious, I am tainted with it. False woman, dye: Lost honour never more (By any Means) admits of any Cure. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Ovid, Solus. Sure I was born when all the glorious Starrs Were met in Councell to contrive a Mischief. Under pretence of my Loose youthfull studies, For the composing of my Art of Love. In my declining years (when I expected Ease, and a quiet Life) I was exil'd From Rome, and here confin'd to end my daies Among a people rude, and almost barbarous, Except a few of th'Gentry and Nobility, In a Cold Country (where fierce Jether payes (Through divers channels) a Continuall Tribute This vast streams into the Euxine Sea, And many have imagin'd Julia Daughter of great Augustus was too gracious. And liberall of her Amorous Favours to me; Which caus'd him to inflict this Punishment. But ere that Emperour left the world, he was Inform'd (for that Particular) of my Innocency: And was acquainted that, if I were faulty, It was an Error in me, not a Crime; For if I er'e enjoy'd her, it was through Her craft; I taking her to be another. But he was too severe; That excellent Princess He shew'd as little Mercy to, as me. Now about Twenty years; in the small Island Of Trimerus (near the Apulian Shores) Confin'd by him sh'hath led a tedious Life. I must confess she had a Generous kindness For me, and took delight to read my Poems. But by her Letters, and Authentick witness Clear'd me sufficiently from that Reproach: And won thereby so much upon her Father, That I had been repeal'd if he had liv'd. Since his Decease by divers Messengers (Persons of Noble Rank and Quality) And by her eloquent Epistles she hath (For my Return to Rome) importun'd much The great Tiberius, her too Cruell Husband. But he that to a wife (who brought him all The Universe in Porcion), shews no mercy, Will not redress my wrongs. Here I must mourn Out all my Life; and find my Funerall Urn. Exit. Scena Quarta. Enter Hannibal, and Cacala. Han. This Captain Dacus is a joviall Blade, Doubtless a very valiant Gentleman, And of an heart as liberall as the Aire. Cacala! How lik'st thou him? Caca. But so, so: yet I was well pleas'd to see him pay the Reckning. You are far from home, and Mistriss Floretta is As chargeable as a stable of running Horses. Han. It is grown somthing late; And Time to think. Of our Return unto our Lodgings. Look! What's that? Espies a man hanging on a Gibbet. Caca. Sir, I see nothing. Han. Cast thy eyes That way. How now! what is't hangs there? Caca. Alas! 'Tis a poor Fellow that was executed. Two, or three daies ago. Han. He had ill fortune. Had he not better have follow'd Mars, and falne In glorious Battail, and his soul exspir'd Through many wounds; then Ignominiously, Thus sneak to death in Noose of paltry halter. Caca. My Captain Hannibal talkes evermore Of mighty Battails, or his litle whore. Han. What mutter you, Sirrah? Caca. I (by your valour's Leave) was saying Captain, Y'on man hangs in a pitifull cold corner. The North wind shakes his Legs as he were dancing Of Wine, and Women, and of all good Meats, He hath forever took his Leave. Han. I'm sorry for's hard Fate. Some lying People Report some of the dead have walk'd. If thou Can'st such a piece of fine Activity show, Come sup with me to night. Thou shalt be welcome. Speaks to the Hungd-man. Caca. He bows his head. Han. Hang 'his head. Caca. He needs not put himself to such unnecessary trouble: He that small favour hath receiv'd already, From some of's smaller Friends. Han. If th'art a good dead Fellow, Come, (I say) And sup with me to night. Spectre, I'le come. Caca. I think I heard him answer; he would come. Han, Thou art so timerous; The Eccho of My voice deludes thee. Han. Follow me thou fearfull Puppy. Caca. A dog, His Captain-ship makes of me; Sir, I shall Even tread upon your Heels: I dare not stay Behind an Inch. Han. Come then, for I fear nothing. Caca. By your Leave. I dread the Gallows mightily: And a Thief That can talk after he's dead is a terrible Bug-bear. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Armelina, Bassanes, and Marullus. Arme. I'me come to wait upon you Brother, and To see how my dear Sister; your Clorina Enjoyes her health. I found among your servants, A generall sorrow as I pas'd along. And you (me thinks) reflect distracted looks: What is the reason of this Alteration, Throughout your Family? Bassa. I am somthing troubled, And now not in condition for discourse. Arme. What is the matter, good Marullus! Though Though may suppose some business, that hath fallen Athwart his Expectation, hath distemper'd Tis thoughts at present; yet I guess he is not Sick. Therefore my afflicted mind misgives me, That my poor Sister is not well; Resolve me, Alas! I see some Malady hath taken her: And he like a Good Husband suffers with her, Grieves for her want of health: Is it not so? Bassa. Sweet Armelina! At this present leave me: I at another time should fitter be, To give you th'Entertainment you deserve; According to the utmost of my power. Arme. The gods be with you: My poor Company Shall be no longer to you troublesome. I hope to find my Sister in her Chamber; And will go sit with her. Bassa. She is not there. Arme. Where is she then? For I resolve to see her. Bassa. She's not in case to give you Entertainment, Or to receive a visit. Arme. Alas! You strike me Almost as dead, as I suspect she is. For Heavens sake teach me where to find her. Bassa. She is alive, I pray you let that satisfy, and leave us. Arme. Not for the World. I will not leave the house Till I have seen, and spoken with Clorina. Bassa. My dear Marullus! Since this Lady is So very importunate, She'l not be diverted, Guide her I pray you to her Sister. Mar. I must obey you; And fair Armelina Shall wait upon you. Exeunt Mar. and Armel. Arme. Lead, and I follow you. Bassa. Now she will Curse me, and traduce my name, Though (the Gods know) her Sister's in the blame. He that refrains for fear of womens Tongs To right himself, basely submits to wrongs. Exit. Scena Sexta. After a small supper set forth, Enter Hannibal, and Cacala. Han. What! Is this all w'are like to have? Caca. So please your Souldier-ship, renowned Captain, This is even all; And it may serve the turn. Although I have an Appetite as sharp As your victorious Sword, great Captain Hannibal. Han. Where is Floretta (Cacala?) Go call her, She will rail at this meat, and call me covetous. Caca. I needs must say, her stomack never fail'd her; Though she's but litle, she's a tall woman at a Trencher. Han. Run, and call her, Tell her the meat, will be cold; And then 'tis spoyld. Caca. I may save that Labour. Mistris Spinella hath invited her to supper. They and Cypassis eat to night together. Han. Will Captain Dacus be there. Caca. I think not Sir. I never knew Cypassis but an hungry: She's not so bountifull, as to invite Others to eat her meat up. Han. How comes it then Floretta is their guest? Sit down, and be not troublesome: You know I'de have it so. Caca. I thank your valour. I have some small suspition Bassanes hath a Likeing took to your Dear Damigolla, and Cypassis must Court her, and tempt her to his various Lust. Han. May be so Cacala! Let him take his Chance: If he so lead, i'le follow him the Dance, Then I will woe Spinella; And he shall Father the spurious Issue i'le get on her. Hark! Some body knocks: Rise, and inform me who Is at the doorâHow now, What art thou deafe, And hear'st me knock; or dumb because thou speak'st not? An Apoplexy sure hath ceaz'd upon thee. Sit down again, and drink a Glass of Wine It will recover thee. Well don, now eat thy meat. Again there knocks some body at the door. Rise once more Sirrah, and conduct them in. Be gon, or I shall kick you to your duty. He opens the door, turns back and fals down, as in a Swound. This Idle Rascall sure the falling Sickness Hath got of late. I must be at the charge, I fear to send for a Physician to him. I wonder who it is: For some body knocks Again. It needs must be a stranger, else He such long Complement would not have shew'd. Still he knocks on. I will go bring him in. Enter Spectre. Your name Sir, and your pleasure Spectre. My name, Helvidius is. Han. You are a stranger Unknown to me; I pray, what is your business. Spectre. I come to sup with you, Han. Though clad so meanly, You shall be welcom. Spectre. I am not so rude, To press upon you, uninvited Captain. Han. Who should invite you? Spec. Sir! Your self. Han. 'Tis strange. I should forget it then. Spec. I come unlook'd for Noble Hannibal, But you did bid me to supper to night. Han. My Memory hath fail'd me. Where Helvidius? Spec. At the Gibbet, by the City walls; Where I did hang in Chains. Han. This is a Curtesy deserves a welcome, You are most welcom Sir, and so believe it. Spec. You are my generous Patron, and I thank you. Han. Sit down, I pray sit down. So: 'tis well done, Cacala! Where's Cacala. Give me a Glass of Wine, What on the flore still! rise man. Cacala. I dare not stir nor breathe, Sir. Han. He will not hurt you. Spec. I shall not be so rude, where I find welcome To do a Mischief. Han. Fill Wine. Sir much good do you; And here's to you, To you fair Mistrisses health; whether alive, Or your Companion it'h Elizian Groves. Spec. You much endear me. Han. Could I have thought you would have supp'd with me, You should have been much better treated. Sit down and eat, Thou silly Cacala! Caca. I am very timerous. His Promise and my Valour do protect Han. thee. Caca. This Napkin thus dispos'd under my Hat, Shall keep my eyes off him. I'le eat like a Lion; Because I sit in fear, and after will Shew the Cud as some Beasts do, to disjest it. Spec. Good Fellow, I salute thee with this Boule: To thy brave Hannibals Mistrisses health. Caca. I have no mind to drink yet. My Master Is the better Pledger of such Fancies. Han. You shall not refuse him. Off with it Cacala: Ill'e conclude it. Spec. It has gon round. Captain, your kindness hath so far oblieg'd me, That I presume to crave a favour of you. Han. You shall command. Spec. I pray you dine with me to morrow. Han. You jest, Spec. I am in earnest: You shall be most welcome. Han. Where? Spec. At the Gibbit. Han. I'le come. Caca. Now my bellie's full, I cannot forbear, To cast a Sheep's eye at him. Oh! oh. Cries out aloud, falls backward, and (with his Legs under the Table) overthrows it, and all the meat. Spect. I thank you, generous Captain; And good night. Han. Farewell Sir; And expect me as I promis'd. Rise thou unmannerly Beast, and let's to bed. Caca. Good Master, And thrice-valiant Captain Hannibal, See me in bed first, and asleep, I beseech you, And let me have Mistriss Floretta; For I dare not lye alone. Han. Follow me and undress me. Caca. Sir I beseech you have a litle Patience: Say that I shall not lye alone to night, And you will Comfort me. I otherwise Shall be so weak with fear, I shall not be Able to pluck your stockins off. Han. Get whom Thou wilt to be thy bedfellow, but Floretta: For, her I cannot spare. Caca. Then I entreat you, Let me lye in the same bed with you both. Han. You must some other Lodging find. Caca. I'st so? Then I must old Cypassis try: Perhaps A Bottle of strong water will prevail So far with her, That she may give me leave, To lye with her. And yet I had much rather Lye with my old Grand-mother, or Grand-father. Han. 'Tis said she was a Beauty in her Youth. Caca. Sure no man can report it that hath seen it: For I believe her birth was in the daies Of Lucius Brutus; who was Rome's first Consul. Exeunt. Scena Septima. Enter Marullus, and Armelina, to Clorina fastned in a Chair, with the heart of Pyrontus in her hand. Arme. Y'ave made me such a terrible Relation Of his strange Jealousy, and his foul Murther, And's barbarous usage of your deer sweet self; That (my Clorina) I'm deficient Of Language to express my Admiration. But (my dull eyes) can you so long refrain From dissolution into showers of Tears? My heart is sure of Stone, or It would break At these Effects of's impious Proceedings. Clor. Have patience, my best sister. 'Tis enough For me to be so miserable: I would not My suffrings should beget a Grief in you. Arme. Then I more stupid were then Salvagesâ Then any beast in any Wilderness, Or any Fury in black Hell it self. Clor. Oh! Armelina how am I beholding Unto you, for your pitty of my wrongs! And yet I needs must grieve to see you thus Afflict your self at the sad sense of them. But I beseech you to assume a Courage, Worthy our Noble Family to orecome it. I shall but a few Minutes longer trouble you With my unfortunate Company. I find My heart too weak to make Resistance longer Against th'impetuous storm of my vast Injuries: I find Death stealing sensibly upon me. Arme. The Heavens forbid. Clor. Prayers come too late now to divert my Fate. I pray you therefore, good Marullus, haste To my dear Husband, and your Faithful Friend. Tell him, I beg but so much favour from him As I may breathe my soul out in his presence And see him once again; and I shall dye Contentedly, and pardon him my wrongs. Mar. Madam! I do beseech you to have patience, I will go for him; And have hope he will Be very shortly reconcil'd unto you: For from my soul I pitty your Misfortunes. Exit Marullus. Clor. Shed no more tears. You have, my Armelina, Spent too much of that precious dew already On poor unworthy me. Arme. You are Clorina! my Elder, and My only Sister: And can I perceive Your Innocency persecuted thus, And seem an unconcern'd spectator of it? It is impossible. Give me leave therefore, T'express all sorrow I am capable of As tribute of my cordiall Affection To your so lovely, sweet, and injur'd Person. Enter Bassanes, and Marullus. Clor. Welcom my too unkind, though my dear Husband. To your Clorina, welcom my Bassanes. My eyes grow dim, and I my heart strings feel To crack. Your harsh suspition of my Loyalty. And so severe an usage of me, have Cut off my life in prime of all my Youth. Here, with my parting breath (in presence of The gods, within the Hearing of your friend Marullus, And of my Sister) I declare I dye Free from all guilt, and never injur'd you. And so Farewell for ever. Gods! I come; Afford my Innocency in Heaven a Room. She dyes Mar. She hath took leave of life. Arme. I did not think, Her death had been so neer. Farewell forever all Content and Pleasure Since she is gon. No thought of Joy shall ever, Possess my heart hereafter. She that was My only happiness is vanish'd from me. Look Monster of Mankind! This is a sight Only befits the eyes of such a Villain. Here thou hast murther'd the most virtuous wife That ever Hymen knew; And one that was In her Affection over-fond of thee. Bassa. Your passion makes you speak, you know not what. Your Sister injur'd me in such high nature That she hath justly brought upon her self, The end that's come upon her. Arme. Th'Anthropophagians that devour mans flesh, By thee may be instructed in worse Cruelties. What Hellish wretch, but thy more Hellish self Would thus have us'd a Lady of her Beauty? To fasten with strong wire's (in a Case of Male) A mans heart in his wife's own hand, and look her With Chains into a Chair, fast; is a Mischief None but Bassanes durst have done. What Tyrant In History did ever act so ill? Perillus was an Innocent to thee. The vengeance of high Jove hangs o're thy head; To strike thee with his forked-Thunder dead. Bassa. No Husband but a Wittall, would have suffer'd The Prostitution of his Wife. Arme. You slander her, basely belye her virtues. She to us all hath clear'd her self. Marullus And I heard her relate the story. It was The saddest that did ever fall from tongue; Which she before had told thee all at large. She doated on thee to her death, and with Her last expiring breath protested freely Her Innocency from thy imputed Crime. Bassa. I care not what you say: She was as foule In her Base Actions, as her Face was Fair. Arme. Thou dost traduce inhumainly her virtue: And I believe forbad'st she should have Meat. Bassa. I did not think of it; And therefore gave Forth no such Order. Arme. If the least Humanity Remains yet in thee, let her be releas'd From these so barbarous bonds, this heart remov'd Out of her hands; It with Pyrontus body Deliver'd to his Friends for Sepulcher: And I will take care for the funerall Rites Of sweet Clorina my poor murther'd Sister. Bassa. T'will ease me of some trouble, and a Charge; Therefore I will consent to that Demand: And the gods keep me from a second Marriage. Arme. Thou need'st not fear that: thou canst not find a woman So lost to Virtue, and to honor; that Dare be a Wife to such a blooddy Butcher. Sure there's no woman in the world so senseless, And wicked as to give her self to thee. I'le tell thy story unto all I meet: And thy Reproach shall ring through every street. Bassa. Your Larum may run on; whil'st I'le declare To all the world how false you women are. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quinti, Scena Prima. Enter Ovid, Philocles, and Caralinda. Ovid. I am amaz'd much, and afflicted more, With the sad newes you have imparred to us. Philo. All my Entreaties could not win him thence: And therefore missing him too long from home, And knowing upon what design he staid, I did enquire of Armelina; who Made me the sad Relation you have heard. Oh brave Pyrontus! I lament thy Fate; That hast in love prov'd so unfortunate. Cara. It is so sad a story you have made us, That it draws teares from my eyes. Though was A stranger to their Persons, my weak sex Allows me liberty to weep. A man Would not be tax'd of Softness, to relent At so deplorable an History. Philo: Madam! I am so far from blaming you, For gracing with your tears their Cruell Fates, That my heart chides mine own eyes for not melting. Hell never plotted a worse Tragedy. Nor ever did so great a Lover find, So merciless a death as Lord Pyrontus: Neither did ever Virtue and Beauty meet So hideous a Treatment as Clorina. Ovid. Have you their Bodies seen, since they were dead? Oh Philocles! If you those woefull objects Have look'd upon, you have beheld a sight More sad than ever Tomos was accus'd for. Philo. Alas! I brought the Heart, and mangled Body Of my dear Friend Pyrontus, to his house. And did attend the Corse of fair Clorina, To Armelina's Pallas: where alas! No April shower ever fell so sweetly, As she doth weep over her Sister. Cara. A word with you dear Cozen Ovid! My eyes Are bigg with tears, and my poor heart is loaden With Grief. A thousand showers cannot drain them. And Time wants years enough to wear away The Sense, and Memory of this woefull day. Ovid. I must beseech you to have patience. Cara. I have too much, dear Ovid! Much too much: But I will all the Fortitude collect That my poor heart is capable of, and shall Suppress all signs exterior of a Grief. You know the Fortune which Trasullus told me. I find, it now points at me; And will therefore Go walk abroad. You are acquainted well With Philocles. I'le leave you with him. Ovid. I will attend upon you. Cara. By no means You are old and sickly; And I will not be So troublesome. Ovid. You shall not go alone. Good Philocles, My Cosin Caralinda Is something undispos'd, and hath a mind To take the Air abroad; You will obliege me To bear her Company. She is a stranger Which is the cause I crave the trouble from you Philo. The Noble Ovid may command me any thing. But you conferre much Grace on me, to give Me leave to wait upon a Gallant Lady, Of so surpassing Excellencies. Cara. You complement (Sir) with me Ovid. Hereafter you may like better of her Company, When you are more acquainted with her. Beware I pray you what you do; Take heed Speaks to Caralinda aside. You give not too much Credit to Predictions. Take heed your vengeance be not rash; Beware You bring not ruine on your Flourishing Youth. Cara. I will not play the Amazon, believe it And so (best Poet) for a while Farewell. Philo. Your servant, generous Ovid! Ovid. Sir, I'm yours, Exeunt Caralinda, and Philocles. O Love, and Jealousy! What mighty power You, mighty passions, have ore humany hearts? How you too often joyn within one breast, And joyes that would aspire keep low supprest! To be enamour'd on a beautifull object; As naturall to us is, as t'eat, and drink: But to suspect whom we affect's, a Crime Declares a guiltiness within one's self; A want of Merit. Then a wise man should Make himself worthy of his Mistriss Love, Or never prosecute his amorous suit. A discreet Lover in a beautious Out-side Expects a mind adorn'd with all the virtues; And holds it an Impiety to think, So rich a soul can ever stoope to vice. Therefore the Lover that is rightly bred, Admits no Jealous thoughts into his head. I wish Bassanes had prov'd such, then he Might have enjoy'd an happy Life on earth: Too passionate Pyrontus then had liv'd, And (in some time) might have overcome himself: The admirable and innocent Clorina Had been alive; This Tragedy had never Been acted here, which will be famous ever. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Bassanes, and Marullus. Mar. If you would give me leave (as your known Friend) Whom you have long grac'd with your Amity) To tell you freely my Opinion, And no offence, take it. I should tell you (My Lord Bassanes) I conceive you have Been much too rash in your proceedings. Bassa. How? If such a thought you harbour of my Actions, I needs must tell Marullus, that he thinks me Guilty of my Wife's blood: Do not imagine Your Friend aspers'd with such a Crime. She was A Gallant Pallace (to do her beauty right) Where all the Devils of Lust inhabited. Mar. I cannot tell, but if one might give Credit To her so often serious Protestations, And to her vowes utter'd with her last breath, She was an Innocent. Bassa. They that dare play So foul a Game value not what they say. Enter Caralinda, and Philocles. What Lady's that? Mar. I never saw her before. Bassa. She is a miracle of such Hansomness; She can no other be but Venus self. Philo. Yonder's the Murtherer of my Lord Pyrontus, And the base user of the best of Women. My Blood is all on fire at this Encounter, My Hilt seems Loadstone, and my hand of Iron; I cannot keep it longer from my Sword. (A suddain vengeance he deserves), which shall Fall on him. At this present I'le revenge The Slaughter of my Friend, and the sad death, Of his so barbarously abus'd Clorina. Cara. Dear Philocles forbear. I do conjure you, By all the Love you bore unto Pyrontus: Suppress your Anger for a While; yet know I wish him but a short Reprieve, and hate him As much as you. He at a fitter Time May find his Destiny. Let it not be said He dy'd it'h presence of a tender mind. Philo. I must obey you, Madam! Bassa. She is an object so extreamly ravishing, I must speak to her. Mar. I had thought you had Done with that Sex for ever. Bassa. I resolv'd so, But Beauty such a Potent Charm is known; Strongst Resolutions It hath overthrown. Haile Female goddess, or if (of woman kind) Haile! rich Epitome of all the Beauty, That ever yet in severall women Nature Reveal'd to human eyes! Cara. Good Philocles! Draw back a little. I would find to what His fine words aime; And he will be more sparing, (If y' are too near us) to express himself. Philo. I will retire a litle. But beware His flatteries win not on your heart. Cara. I warrant you. Bassa. My Friend Marullus, I beseech you walk Aside. Mar. I shall, my Lord, obey you. Good day to Philocles! Pray shun me not: For I am much afflicted at the Tragedies Bassanes Rage, and Jealousy have acted; I had no hand in them, and could I have Prevented them, they had not been perform'd. Cara. You both provoke my wonder, and my blushes, Become enamour'd on a stranger? One You never saw before! Philo. Marullus he hath done such horrid Acts, The gods can never punish him enough. Bassa. It doth become your Beauty, to work such wonders. Madam! I am one of the chiefest Persons Of all this Province, and have an heart to love you, Above the expressions of a Thousand Tongues. Cara. Your name (Sir) I beseech you. Bassa. 'Tis Bassanes. Cara. What he that (through his Jealousy, and fury) Murther'd Pyrontus, and his innocent Wife? Bassa. You have been misinform'd. He did deserve The Fate he found: And her shame broke her heart. I am the same Bassanes but not guilty Of any Crime. They in their deaths found Justice. Cara. Iv'e heard too much of them already. But how Can you so fresh a widdower so soon, Give Entertainment to a second Flame? Bassa. Your Beauty that can work such Miracles Is a sufficient reason. Cara. I may prove The like sad destiny Clorina did, Should I become your wife. Bassa. It is impossible You are an Heaven where all the virtues meet, And therefore cannot be inconstant to Your Wedlock-vowes. Cara. I merit not (Bassanes) This favour at your hands. If I e're wed, It shal be unto one of my own Country. Bassa. Within a Body form'd to all Perfection That ever liberall Nature, and the gods Could, can, or ever shall make up (fair stranger), Give not an Entertainment to Contempt Of yuor enslav'd Bassanes, neither in'it Lodge thoughts disdainfull, nor an heart of Flint. Cara. 'Tis an Astonishment in me to hear you, To make so passionate discourse to me. Even One whose name you neither know, nor Fortune: I may be poor, and vitious. Bassa. Nothing but Virtue Can in a body so Beautifull inhabite. Vice dares not so presumtious be, as t'enter Under so fair a Roof: And y' are so rich In Beauty, that I with more joy should marry you, Then t'be saluted Emperour of the world. Cara. You court me now indeed. I have some business Of such Concern, that at this time no longer I can stay with you. Bassa. But must you needs be gon? Cara. I must, in trueth. Bassa. When shall I then receive So great a blessing as t'enjoy a second time Your Coveted Company? Cara. Within this half hower, I'le meet you here again. Bassa. Y' ave rais'd me to A joy as great, as Jove himself can know. Cara. Come generous Philocles. I will impart Our Parley freely to you, and acquaint you With the whole Cause, why I entreated you To stifle your Revenge, and to retard His death. You shal know al my secret thoughts. Philo. Sweet Caralinda, you obliege me much I shall attend you any where. Exeunt Caralinda, and Philocles. Bassa. Marullus! Cupid hath pointed all his shafts, with the Fair beams of this bright Lady's eies. I am Become enamour'd on her to that height That I must marry her, or I shall dye. Mar. The Heavens forbid. Bassa. Nay rather, friend, may all the gods vouchsafe it. Mar. You know not what she is, she may be much Unworthy of such Nuptialls; Resist betimes, Physick too late is took When sickness (through delay) is fix'd at th'root. Mar. Surely she can No other be, but Ovids kins-woman; Who (we have heard) so lately came to Tomos; I will presume her, then, of noble Birth. That excellent Poet is my worthy Friend: And I may hope will easily be won, T'assist me to attain her to my wife. Me thinks he should be glad to have his Cosin Well Matched here; To be fix'd a constant comfort Both to his Age, and Grief for his Exilement. Mar. May the just Powers Divine, turn all to th'best. Bass. If I obtain her to become my Wife, An Heaven on Earth, I shall enjoy this Life. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Hannibal, and Cacala. Cala. Sir, I intreat you (my too valiant Captain!) To give me leave to return home. I have No mind to such a formidable Dinner. Han. What should'st thou fear? My keen victorious Sword Carries spells strong enough to conjure down All the unruly Fiends of Pluto's Court. Therefore for shame take Courage. Thou had'st wont To have a good stomack to thy meat: And sure This Gallant Ghost will treat us very Nobly. Caca. I have an horror to such Company: And had a thousand times much rather be With Mistris Floretta, and converse with her. Han. Thou talk'st so often of her that think Thou art in love with her. Caca. I must confess, I have some smackering that way. But the Awe I stand in of your Indignation, Deterres me from professing my Respects. I wish your Captainshipp would cast her off; And give me leave to make her my honest Wife. Han. Thou talk'st Impossibilities, Fool Cacala! To think to make an whore an honest woman. Such an One wood indeed prove a strange wonder. And he that should to such an One be wed, Might raise a mighty Portion to himself, By taking mony for the sight of her. Cacala. His tongue's no slander. Aside. Han. Walk on: w'are almost there. Caca. I'm monstrously afraid. Han. Fear nothing in my Company, but the marrying Of an whore. Caca. I ever dreaded stories of Hobgoblins, But evermore abhord the sight of them: Beseech you therefore Captain Hannibal, Give me leave to go back. Han. Thou shalt not leave me: I will make thee valiant, And neither to fear Men, nor Divels. Caca. Heaven Bless me! Han. We shall have a brave dinner without doubt. Caca. Instead of a Calfes head, and glorious Bacon A skull half rotten of some Malefactour, Stollen from a Neighbour-Gallows to his own: And (in the place of a brave side of Venison) The salt Hanch of some executed Bawd: And in the room of Grecian Wines, the Moisture That doth distill from their hang'd putrifi'd bodies. Sir, I will take my leave. Han. Thou shalt go with me, And (when Employment calls me forth again) I'le make thee my Lieftenant: w'are almost there. Look you! He is come down from off his Gibbet. 'Tis the most courteous fellow that ere dy'd By skurvy Haltar. Wood his Judges were Trus'd up i'ns place, and all the villanous Jury That did condemn so brave a Spark. Enter Spectre. Spectre. Welcome thou Noblest Son of Mars Give me Thy hand, thou servant to great Hannibal. Cacala. I wish you would excuse me the Complement. Spectre. You need not fear me. Han. Cacala be couragious, and dread nothing My friend Helvidius will no hurt do to thee Should Cerberus bark but at thee; with my Sword I (at one blow) would cut off all his heads. A Table set forth, cover'd with a black Linnen cloth, all the Napkins of the same colour; the meat, and dishes, Bottles, Wine, and all things else. Spectre. You see your Entertainment, and are both Most heartily welcome. Let us sit, and eat. They all sit down and eat. Caca. I do not like the Colour of this Linnen. The Meat, and Wine, and every thing is black. Spectre. 'Tis the sole Colour us'd in Pluto's Court. Caca. The meat tasts well though. Though I had rather be At a piece of Bread and Cheese at Madam Cypassis's. I cannot choose but eat. I think my fear Hath added to my Hunger. Spectre. Gallant Hannibal, I dedicate this Boul to thy Floretta. Han. Off with it then, thou only Worthy of The other world. Here Cacala, thou shall pledg me. Caca. I'le do my weak Endeavour. Han. I thank you Sir, and in Requitall drink To him or her you most affect. Spectre. Y' are Noble. Friend Cacala, heres to you, and you conclude it. Caca. I dare not do otherwise. Han. Would you excuse my Curiosity Sir. I would enquire Why you were executed. Spectre. I'le satisfy you. The Lords, and Gentry of This City Tomos gave order to a Statuary To make the Image of the Poet Ovid, In beaten Massy Gold, for the Honor he Had done them, by writing an excellent Poeme; I'th Getick Language in Tiberius praise. When it was ready to have been presented, I got into the house, and stole it thence: Melted it privately, and put it off By litle Parcels, spent it on wanton wenches, And among boon Companions. In my Cupps Brag'd on't to two false Brothers, who betraid me. Han. I would they had been born both Dumb, and Fools. Spectre. I pray you give me leave to be as free With you. Why were you banish'd and confin'd? Han. A poor old woman, and a witch, a Friend Of mine, pretended an Occasion to make use Of a live Infant, rip'd out of the Belly Of's Mother: And th'Enchantment she was hammering Was for my service. I stole into a Cottage That stood alone, where such a woman liv'd then, Found her alone, and had so laid My Plot That I might undisturb'd proceed; cut up Her belly, took her Infant thence, and sow'd A Cat up in the Place; So she enjoyn'd me. This simple Sorceress being for other Matters accus'd, and like to dye, confes'd This Prank. Spectre. How chanc'd it, you escap'd with life? Caca. My Captain is the greatest villain that I ever heard of: I will leave his service: Although I have oft been told of this before. Han. The Favorite, all-powerfull Sejanus, Did bring me off with life. I help'd him to Floretta's maidenhead, For which good turn I also had some Baggs cram'd with Sesterces. Spect. You had good fortune to escape so well. Han. Some business calls me home, I give you thanks For this brave Entertainment; So Farewell. Spectre. I pray you stay a while, you shall Look on A little Maskque I have provided for you. Han. You much obliege me, and are over liberal Of your high Favours to me. Enter (after very solemn loud Musick) Ãacus, Rhadamanthus, and Minos, the Judges of Hell; Alecto, Tysyphone, and MegÃ¦ra the Furies; and dance altogether to lowe Musick. Spectre. Ãacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, the three Judges in Hell; Tysyphone, MegÃ¦ra, and Alecto, The Furies there (of equall number to them) Lead in a Dance. Cacala. Can Divels be so merry! But I had ever thought there had been rather Three thousand Judges there, then three; I wonder Their number is so few: so of the Furies; For oft, on earth, one woman hath more in her. The Dance ended, this Song follows. I. Most happy is the Libertine, And of mankind the most ingenious; Who from grave precepts doth decline, And doth indulge his Joviall Genius. Oh! the joyes, the joyes, They have that follow Vice, Without any fear of the gods: Who freely wast their Treasures, To purchase them their Pleasures; And are with the virtuous at odds. II. The Atheist is the greatest fool, Who only aimes to please his Senses; Thinking in heaven no gods bear rule, And tipples, murthers, swears, and wenches. Oh! the woes, the woes, That follow all those Who weare out their lifes in vice, That swear, whore, kill, and drink And never them bethink, Till they fall into Hell in a trice. After the Song is ended they all seize on him, and Carry him away. Han. Must I be then betraid thus! False Helvidius! Exeunt. with him. And foolish Hannibal to trust to Spectres! Spec. Away with him. Down to the Infernall shades Of Griesly Pluto's Kingdom let him sink. A fouler soul was never seen in Hell, Wher's Witchcrafts, Rapes, Murthers, and vitious Life Will find a sutable endless punishment. The Spectre vanisheth. Caca. This was a Terrible sight indeed. Heaven keep me But in my wits till I can see Floretta. And I shall tell her such a Tale, as will Make her turn virtuous, if she hath not lost All love to th'Powers Divine, and fears no vengeance. Exit. Scena Quarta. Enter Bassanes, Solus. Bassa. I find my self half rais'd to happiness Already, after my so late Affliction. The stranger Ladie's Beauties triumph here Within my heart; My hopes are fair enough That I shall win her to become my wife: Then all my future daies I shall esteem To be a lasting Festivall, and more To be priz'd by me then are all the Fasti, Observ'd the year through, in our Kalender. Enter PhÅbianus, and Philocles. PhÅbia. I now have made you well acquainted with My Person, and my History, and have to you Reveal'd the reason why I did entreat You to forbear Bassanes, when your Rage Would fain have flung you on him. Now you know The cause why I will meet him. Give me therefore Leave (Noble Philocles) to go alone. I fear him not at all, and shall not have Any need of your kind Assistance. 'Tis The will, sure, of the gods, that I should singly Encounter him. Therefore retire (my Friend,) Neer hereabouts you may conceal your self: You within call may stay, I shall have quickly Dispatch'd with him, and shall not fail then to Hollow you back. See there he is a Walking, And waiting my approach. Philo. You must command me, The Gods be with you. Philocles withdraws. PhÅbia. Well met Bassanes. Ovids kins-woman, The stranger Caralinda, hath imploid me To you, to make Apology for her Not meeting you according to her promise; Why do you look so wishly on me? Do you Know me? Bassa. I certainly have seen your face Before. Some Alteration that I find Some years of absene might have made. Resolve me I pray you Sir, Are you not PhÅbianus? Pyrontus younger Brother, that have spent Three, or four years abroad? If y' are not he I never saw two Faces so alike. PhÅbia. I PhÅbianus am, and Caralinda, Whom you so lately troubled with your Courtshipp. Through the Providence of the Almighty Gods, I met with thee in that disguise: And parted From thee but to divest me of those Cloathes, And bring my sword to our next Parly. 'Tis needless To tell thee more; And I have too much time Trifled away in this Discourse. Pray draw Your sword; For one of us must dye. Thou trayterously, and unawares did'st murther My brave, and hopefull Brother. Though he lov'd Clorina, he deserv'd her better farr Then thou, never attempted violence unto her, And (in a litle Time) might have subdu'd His too unruly passion. Thou hast broke Thy Innocent Lady's heart with usages More horrid then a Scythian ever practis'd: Therefore unless you will dye basely, draw. Bassa. You are a glorious Talker, fine young man: But I shall presently allay your pride; And the fond Confidence you seem to have In your own valour. PhÅbia. Let us try your skill. Bassa: Y'ave sought your ruine by provoking me. They Fight. PhÅbia. So. Have you yet enough? Bassa. Oh! You have slain me. I have received so home a Thrust, I dye. Without another word. Bassanes die's Enter Marullus. PhÅbia. Marullus in an equall Duell I Have kil'd your Friend. The gods did guide my sword, Justice was on my side: He slew my Brother: And I in Roman honor could do no less, And to preserve my Reputation cleare, Among the Getes my Country-men, then to Fight fairly with him. Mar. My mind misgave me some dysastrous Fate Would overtake him for so foule a Murther. Though I am Griev'd at his sad death, I'am glad You are, my Lord, return'd so safely home. PhÅbia. You'l see his body convey'd unto his house. Mar. I shall not fail. PhÅbia. The gods preserve you. Mar. Farewell, brave PhÅbianus. PhÅbia. Friend Philocles! Call's aloud. Philo. I'm (at your service) here. PhÅbia. Stay, and Il'e come to you. Exit. Mar. Draw near you that his servants are, and bear Enter Servants. This sad Load to his Pallace. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Captain Dacus, Cacala, Cypassis, Floretta, and Spinella. Cypas. It was a Lamentable Spectacle We met withall as we came hither. Dacus. An usuall one; a dead man: We Souldiers smile upon a thousand such. Cypas. Bassanes was an extraordinary Person. Dacus. CÃ¦sars, and Lords, must dy. Caca. You talk of Trifles. The story I related you, Of my Master Captain Hanniballs being took away with Devils, Deserves to be call'd terrible indeed. Hell broke loose on him, Divels, and Divels-Dam's Ceaz'd both upon him. He would faine have hung An Arse, but no Resistance could prevail: Away they hurried him, and left me in So great a fear, I know not how I came home. Flor. Thou hast told us too much of this already, And too often. Caca. T'will never out of my Memory. Flor. Nor from thy tongue I fear. Caca. Oh fear the gods, Mistriss Floretta, fear them Take heed, the Divels show you not such a Trick: Turn virtuous pritty One, and marry me. For I do love thee above woman kind, Show thy self therefore to me a kind woman. Flor. Though I am sorry my Hannibal is perish'd so: I cannot call him back; And must some care Take of my self. And therefore Cacala I'le be thy wife. All his remaining Goods Are ours. Caca. And I have something too to trust to In my own Country. Cypas. Here's a Match soon made up. Flor. We will return to Rome. Caca. With all my heart. Dacus. And will my fair Spinella prove as kind? Spinel. Now Lord Bassanes is dead, I am content To receive Captain Dacus for my Husband: Mother! I hope of your allowance to it. Cypas. And you shall have it. The gods grant you joy. Dacus. My Mother Cypassis now indeed! Cypas. You knew her Father. He was your Countriman And a fine Gentleman, when he in Rome Did marry me; I else should never have been Content t'have liv'd in so remote a Province. Though his good nature, and many Losses at Sea, Melted away most of his Land, we have Silver and Gold enough to make you live In plenty. Dacus. Mother, I kiss your reverent hand In Gratitude. What my own means may prove Deficient in, my valour shall supply. Spin. Wee'l have no fighting nor any Quarrelling: I am for peace. Love hates the noise of War. Dacus. You are too timorous; Grow as affectionate: For thus I print my Soul upon thy Lipps. Caca. Let us go home, send for a Priest of Hymens; And presently each Couple on's be married. Omnes. Agreed, agreed. Caca. I dare not lye alone to night for fear My Captain, or his Friends, should give me a visit. Spinel. Was Hannibal, a Gentleman by birth? Dacus. My pritty Oneâ Brave Hannibal the famous Carthaginian, Who march'd like Mars, even to the walls of Rome, And fought against that Senate for the worlds Empire; In one of's winter Quarters at Salapia, Obtain'd th'Affection of a Beautifull Lady Call'd Issidora: And from them he was Descended lineally; As He lately told me. Spinel. And is now Descended to the Divel; we have heard, how Exeunt Omnes. Scena Sexta. Enter Ovid, PhÅbianus, Philocles, Armelina, and Servants. PhÅbia. My Father (on his death bed) did enjoyn me. (For Educations sake) to stay so long. You grace me (excellent Armelina) much After so long a Triall to receive me. Arme. I nothing have worthy your Acceptation, But my reciprocall Return of Love. PhÅbia. I kiss your hand for so immense a bounty. But why (my fairest) would you never honor My many Letters with one single Answer? Arme. I durst not; fearing (among the Roman-Ladies) You might have made a second Choice, and then Have left me, blasted in my Reputation. PhÅbia. I was too true, and you was too severe Arme. But wherefore came you so disguis'd; and why? From me would you conceal your self? PhÅbia. 'Tis reasonable, that I should satisfy you. Just upon my departure out of Italy, My Curiosity lead me to Trasullus, One of the chief Astrologers of these Times, And happy in foretelling future fortunes: I made Friends to him, and receiv'd these verses. âReturn disguis'd in womans Cloathes, and you âThe Murtherer of your Friend shall pay his due; âObtain your Mistriss to become your Bride, âAnd with her gain a world of wealth beside. Ovid. Bassanes his death, and fair Clorinas's wealth, (You being her Heir) added to your great Portion, Confirm for Trueth the Soothsayer's Prediction Arme. And I again must thank you for so bravely Revenging on Bassanes, his foul Cruelties. But why (my PhÅbianus) would you not Disclose your self to me? PhÅbia. You are my Countri-woman; And I fear'd So doing, I should have broken my Injunctions: But now (divinest Lady) when shall I Be made so happy by your gratious self, As to receive you for my Bride? Arme. As soon As I can give some stint unto my Tears; After my Sisters Obsequies are past. Philo. Pray listen! What noise is that without? I think I hear an horn, and 'tis some Post. Enter A Post. PhÅbia. From whence, my Friend, come you? Post. From Rome. Phylo. What news? Post. I've Letters for the famous Poet Ovid. Ovid. Deliver them. I'am that unfortunate man. Ovid breaks open his Letters and reads. I am undone for ever. No more hope, For my Return must ever Flatter me. My wife writes to me, she hath us'd the utmost Of her Endeavour (assisted by the chiefest Of both our Friends, and of most power with CÃ¦sar.) For my Repeal, or but (at least) Removall, To a more temperate Clime; And that th'are both Refus'd her; and she enjoyn'd perpetuall silence, In my behalf. Besides, my Friend GrÃ¦cinus, (A Roman of high nore) hath writ me word The Gracious Princess Julia, our great Empress And my best Friend is, in Trimerus, dead. One of these News were much too much to strike My poor and Crazy body into my Grave: But joyning both their Poysonous stings together; I needs must to the world this Truth impart, That Ovid dies here of a broken Heart. Dies. Phyl. It was too sad a Truth his last breath did Express: For he, alas! is dead indeed. Arme. Death is too prodigall of his Tragedies In this small City. I must spare from my Clorina's Fate one shower of tears to shed. Upon his Grave. Phyl. Not only we, but all the Getick Nation Were worse then barbarous, paid we not that duty To Excellent Ovid's infelicious End. Arme. He was a most accomplish'd Gentleman, A Person affable, and sweet condition'd; And of the Roman Poets the most ingenious! Phyl. He was in Italie at Salmo born A pleasant City within the Territory Of the Peligui, and descended of The Ancient Family of the Nasones; Who had preserv'd the Dignity of Roman Knights, from the first Original of that Order. I'th Asiatick wars, he under Varro Had eminent Command, and well discharg'd it: Who now alas (after seaven years exilement) Hopeless of a Repeal, hath breath'd his last. Arme. Take up his Noble Body, and bear it gently To his own house; We all will wait on it thither. PhÅbia. I'le have a stately Monument erected, (Without our City walls, near the chief Gate) To his fair Memory, to declare the Gratitude Of Tomos to him; for the Honour It Receiv'd by his so long abode among us: Enclos'd in which (within a Mable-urne) Curiously wrought, his Ashes shall for ever Remain in peace; An endless Grace to Pontus! Phil. No Poet ever did more glory contribute Unto the Latin Language, thru his Pen. The Soul of Poetry feels a Convulsion By his Decease He no superiour knew, In that sweet Art, And was great Virgil Equal. His works have an Eternity stamp'd on them, Do far exceed the Consul Cicero's verses, And all the Lines sacred Augustus ever. Writ in a numerous strain; All the fine Poems, The Darling of the People, the Facecious And valiant Prince CÃ¦sar Germanicus Hath publish'd with Applause; And all such Things Though writ by hands that were the spoyls of Kings. Ovids Body being removed. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
