      <field name="fulltext">Artemona. As fortunate that woman is that doth a husband mary accordinge to her hearts desyre: So is she most vnhappy, that matched is wt h Iunos frowne, &amp; to a husband tyed that eyther is perverse, or wt h some foule disease infected. And though there many matrones be of honest reputation wt h in the citty that are matcht to men of lewed condition (for hardly you can fynde a man that faythfull ys &amp; true vnto his wyfe in all respects) Yet none haue cause to rue so much their mariage, as I haue: vnlesse yt be more misery to lyue wt h brawlers, Banckrouts &amp; such as committ adultery, then wt h one wt h the foule disease of leprosy infected: as none amongst you all I thinke will say, yf she were asked. from hence procede these trickleinge teares. Here of come these deepe sighes. from this same fountayne &amp; no other do springe my greatest greefes. When I but fixe my mynde vpon the state of my superiours, or else consider wt h my selfe, the case of my inferiours, good lord how I blush to thinke how vnluckely I matched? what shame take I yt for to be in this lewd maner maryed? No crosse to be compar'd wt h myne on any one euer light &amp; yet (wretch that I was) I could by no meanes blesse me from yt. What therefore now remaynes for me, but for to lyue for ay in endlesse sorrow, or consume &amp; pyne wt h griefe away? In to what state the mater is now brought you all may see. That wc h to others is most ioy I fynd my greatest misery. I well perceiue that womens hopes do ofter proue most vayne I thought when to my husband I made choyce of such a captayne that honourably descended was, much of the kinge esteemed, belou'd of euery man, &amp; higly for his prowes commended, of person proper, fayre of condition, rych, &amp; in great authority I of all women should haue bene most fortunate &amp; happy. But out alas neuer till then my sorrow did begin. But hist, Phronesium here doth come, who my mayd longe hath byn She is as nimble as a bee, prompt, diligent, &amp; ready about her worke, &amp; therefore I haue made her bondage easy: &amp; never wil'd her for to do any thinge that was not fittinge &amp; of a bondslaue made her free, I had of her such lykeinge. And in her's truly verifyed: Such maners, &amp; conditions as euery one ys of, such for the most part are their fortunes. But much I muse why shee lookes back so ofte, &amp; whom shee seeketh Phronesium I wonder much where Dorio ys. It's mervell but hee sleepeth in one odd corner or an other for that's his vsuall fashion: for to his worke he'l not be tyed, yf that he can get gone. Artemona I'l nearer go &amp; listen what yt ys that she doth say Phronesium I thinke we shall see hym no more while there's any light of day. Ill lookes my maister to his prophet, that such a drone will suffer in his house for to dwell, who to his bread deserues not water &amp; will not thrust hym out at dores as one that's good for nothinge. vnlesse he better plye his worke Beggery will be his endinge Artemona Some body shee vpbrayds wt h sloth: yt's meruell but yt's Dorio wt h whom shee seldom can agree. But to her I will go Phronesium what is the matter, that thou who art so gentle so highly art displeas'd? The cause I pray thee to me tell. Phronesium What mistres are you there? Alas I saw you not before. All that you char'd me wt h ys done, ere I came out at dore. And to the shambles I am goinge meate to provide for supper Artemona. Thanks thou deserues, who in thy mistres absence dost not loyter. &amp; for thy diligence yf in any thinge I may the pleasure eyther by worde or deede, I'l yt performe there of be sure Phronesium. Mistres yf I haue here to fore done, or do at this present any thinge that to your lykeinge was, or geues you now content I am right glad in sooth. But there ys no cause why your gentlenes should promisse me reward, for the performance of your busines, for duty bynds me for to do all that wt h in my power. And blame I worthy were yf that at any tyme I should loyter Though not wt h standinge I haue tayste ofte of your liberality but namely when of your bondslaue a free woman you did make me. &amp; vpon no desert of myne the best benefit bestowed on me, that you had for to geue, or I my selfe haue wished. But what needes many wordes? I can not speake of you so honourably but your kyndnes &amp; loue deserued haue farre better of mee And happy I did thinke my selfe that light on such a mistres who was so good to please &amp; euer better then her promise And I no lesse am blest in that I haue mett wt h a maister who loues you so, that for your sake he loues me much the better. Artemona O that he such a one were as thou takes hym for to bee Phronesium Alas mistres ys he not so? then doth he much deceiue mee. whence cometh this deepe sigh? from some great griefe, sure she's not well. Artemona My griefe Phronesium's great, &amp; yet I can not yt expell. Phronesium from sorrow &amp; care I would haue sworne mistres you had bene free for one would thinke you nothinge want that can desyred bee Artemona No doubt thou so persuaded art: for no body can tell where the shoe doth pinch, but she that yt vpon her foote doth weare. Phronesium Where as aboundance ys of all good thinges, can griefe be lodged? Artemona. Whyther steales not griefe? None can be found that ys on all parts blessed Phronesium We for the most part mistres are wt h this disease infected that neuer wt h our selues nor our estate we are contented. The faults of women many are, but this vpon a certayne the greatest ys: that lightly they of their husbands complayne. But you (vnder correction) must avoyde this same suspicion yf that you will accompted be wyse &amp; of good condition. Artemona. Thou would not say so yf thou knew how the case standeth wt h mee Phronesium That's strange, syth you in my opinion of all women are most happy Artemona Phronesium thou art much deceiud. yf thou were in my case farre other wyse thou wouldest say, then now yt seemes thou sayes. Phronesium Alas, mistres alas, tell me: what's yt that doth you greeue. for euer I tooke you to be the happiest woman alyue. Artemona It no relation needes, &amp; there fore make no more enquiry. Phronesium Be lyke you thinke I'l blabbe yt out agayne vnto some body I aske not to that ende in sooth, but rather that I may asswage your griefe, yf that I can not take yt quite away for that shallow witted ys, may some tyme counsell geue that wholesome ys, &amp; a seely mouse a Liones may releeue. &amp; many tymes th'impartinge of ones griefe vnto an other eyther quite taketh yt away, or makes yt seeme farre lesser. Artemona I thinke no lesse: yet for all that, of thinges, (such as these bee wc h rather are to be conceal'd, then told to others publykely. no such yonge girles as thou art, ought inquiry for to make Phronesium Agaynst my yeares I do confesse you may exceptions take yet for all that vnlesse you do impart your griefe vnto mee I will (though yt agaynst good maners be) still make enquiry hopeing yt will be for your good. And yf I through affection the bonds of modesty do exceede, most humbly I craue pardon. Where fore as you do loue your selfe, husband or mayd declare your greefe to me, by whom yt shall not be bewrayd. And yf I can not take yt cleane away, I hope deare mistres for to abate yt much, yf you will folow my aduise. Artemona Dost thou say so my girle? Then will I breake mynd vnto thee. But here ys no conuenient place, lest I be heart of any body. for here out comes I know not who, but as I thinke yt's Dorio a listninge idle rogue, as thou well knowes: Away let's go. Dorio. It probable ys that slouthfulnes in to this world me brought &amp; that a father me begott, who neuer days worke wrought. for at the very name of worke my flesh &amp; bones do shiuer &amp; I had rather hanged be then worke I am so lither: And there fore while our maydes wt h in about their busines went I secretly stole out at dores my taske for to preuent And now when supper tyme drawes neare, &amp; all the worke is ended I home returne to fill my gorge. But there's I feare prouided a rodde for me in steede of meate by our tell tayle Phronesium wc h to my mistres all things tells, that in her mynde do come. &amp; makes the matter often worse by addinge or diminishinge all to discredit but her selfe: for in that art she's cunninge. And no regard hath what she tells, nor of whom she complayneth by meanes where of she deadly hate of all the house procureth. exceptinge her mayster &amp; mistres, who because they heare by her such thinges as wt h their humours suite, still wt h her beare. And for that only cause &amp; nothinge else, they on a sodayne of a bond slaue to all our grieffes haue made her a free woman. But hist, I here alonge do spye her with my mistres cominge yf they me see hang'd must I bee, wherefore hence I'l be sneaking Artemona How now Phronesium art thou yet persuaded that I am of all that liuinge are this day the most unhappy woman? Phronesium I did suspect in deede that he was not sound of his body But litle thought I that he had infected bene with lepry. Artemona. A me pore wretch what shall I do? more miserable there ys none. Phronesium I pray you mistres for god sake, syth that can not be done wc h you desyre, desyre that wc h may effected bee. Artemona. It's easy good aduise to geue to others in their misery but if thou felt my griefe an other tayle then thou wouldest tell. Phronesium M.r s weepe not, for that will make you sicke, though you were well. Rather consider what's expedient in this your great extremity to be done, &amp; beare this as all thinges else you haue borne patiently Artemona Alas shall I wt h patience tolerate this? Yt is not possible. I nothinge can expect but all my lyfe to be most miserable. But thinkes thou that for my desert this misery's on me fallen. Phronesium No m.r s but to grieue at that wc h no wayes can be holpen no wisdome ys: for the thinge that's once done can neuer bee vndone agayne: &amp; there fore make a vertue of necessity &amp; patience haue. Assure your selfe you are not crost alone for others haue as well as you their crosses euery one though of a different sort: for none in all respects are happy. Wey wt h your selfe how fortunate in all things else you bee but this alone: where of if he clearly might once be freed what woman then for happines wt h you might be compared? Artemona. Phronesium) thou sayst well, if he were free'd of this one thinge but this one thinge makes me the wretcedst woman this day lyuing Phronesium yf all things else be to your mynde as I do thinke they are you haue more cause for to reioyce, then be opprest wt h care. Let not there fore one yll make in your brest deeper impression then so many good things. but for these beare that wt h moderation. The rather because that your griefe is powered out in vayne when as yt helps you not, though neuer so much you do complayne. Take courage therefore vnto you: Lett patience be your buckler So shall your selfe fynde ease, &amp; geue content vnto my maister, when he perceiues you beare wt h hym his heauy crosse contentedly. Artemona. To patience still persuades thou mee? Shall I his crose beare silently? Then will my heart a-sunder burst. I must needes speake Phronesium. Phronesium I see not to what ende, syth that no good there of doth come but rather yll, for by complayneinge you do duble your misery when as you neyther fynde for his griefe, nor your owne a remedy. Where fore haue patience, &amp; make triall what comfort yt affords Artemona. Keepe thy persuasions to thy selfe, yf they be but bare wordes: for I no more good there by fynde then by vtteringe my misery. Phronesium Is there no helpe for hym by phisicke? I pray you mistres tell mee. Artemona Oh none: for so all the phisitions haue generally affirmed. Phronesium Yet there's a god, of whom yf he craue helpe, he may be cured. Artemona There are no gods that on vs haue regard: not one that pitties vs. for we both vnto men, &amp; to the gods are also odious. Phronesium Dispayre no yet, for I for his dysease haue found a remedy. Artemona A remedy Phronesium? what? I pray the tell me quickely. Phronesium. There ys a certayne holy prophet (deare mistres) in Samaria who for strange miracles &amp; good lyfe ys knowne through out Iudea. To whom yf that my maister will voutsafe for to repayre losse of your loue (more deare to me then lyfe) I hazard dare that he shall sounde of body home returne wt h out delay. Artemona. Tell me Phrenosium, ys that true wc h thou dost to me say. Phronesium mistres) most true, or else to speake yt I were much to blame. And yf he will but triall make, th'euent shall proue the same. And thinke not (though you be his wyfe) that you his health desyre more then I who am but his mayd) whom he did lately hyre. for in that I'l not yeelde to you. &amp; reason I haue for yt syth in his seruice I haue gott both freedome, loue, &amp; creditt wc h more then lyfe I do esteeme. And loth I am to bee vngratefull vnto hym, &amp; you, who haue vs'd me so kyndly. Artemona I see thou art no changelinge, but retaynest thy old honesty &amp; therefore I thy wordes will credit: &amp; heartely desyre thee yf euer thou found frendship at my handes yt to repay by pittyinge me pore soule, who wt h griefe dayly pynes away. Phronesium Alas mistres intreate me not, for I your seruant am ready to do at your command for you all that I can &amp; there fore tell me what yt ys, that you would haue me do Artemona As thou hast tolde me of the prophet, So tell thy maister too &amp; earnestly persuade hym for to make a iourney thither &amp; if he through thy counsell go &amp; sound agayne come hyther assuredly thou purchase shall vnto thy selfe there by greate honour, &amp; be much enriched, &amp; advanced highly. Phronesium. That office mistres by your selfe may better be discharged because you are his wyfe, &amp; wt h his fashions. best acquainted Artemona. well as thou wilt. yet at the least I would haue thee be by that thou my speeches may confirme, yf he thinke that I lye. Phronesium I will in this, &amp; all thinges mistres geue you content Artemona. Then when thou hast at shambles bene, see thou come in incontinent And now I'l to my husband go t'acquaint hym wt h this matter. Phronesium. And I'l no longer stay but whyle I buy meate for your supper. How sory am I for to see my Lady thus perplexed whom I tooke to haue bene the happiest woman that euer lyued. I well perceive a womans iudgment may erroneous bee syth most unfortunate shee ys, who seem'd to me most happy. I would not my estate exchange for hers, though myne be poreer for I lyue merely on a litle, &amp; nothinge will content her what pleasure tell me were yt for mee a princes to be styled &amp; wt h a gallant trayne of maydes, &amp; men to be attended &amp; haue the people to me crouch &amp; bowe wt h capps in hand &amp; I that while be forc't to lyue &amp; lye wt h such a husband that is infected wt h the horrible &amp; loathsome disease of leprosy. A kingdome so to do would not me please. &amp; there fore my mistres miserable estate the more I pitty But I to free them from their greefes I hope haue found a remedy &amp; yf yt come to passe, how greatly shall I be esteemed. And there's no doubt of good successe yf that he'l be persuaded thither for to go. In hope where of I will stay here no longer but to the shambles runne for to provide meate agaynst supper. Naaman What man this day alyue ys more vnfortunate then I &amp; vnto whom do all good fortunes fall out so vnluckely? wo's me pore wretch! where fore haue I at any tyme endeuoured for to avoyd the perills of warre, or any daunger shunned? had yt not better for me beene for to haue dyed honourably by the handes of myne enemyes, then for to haue lyu'd thus miserably vext, &amp; tormented wt h this foule disease of lepry, then wc h none more loathsome ys? o the fayth both of gods &amp; men! my body can I no way purge of this plague, nor fynde remedy to cure the same, but must I lyue in sorrow &amp; payne continually? Wc h way haue I not for phisitions sent to my great Cost? &amp; swallowed pills, &amp; potions drunke? &amp; all this charge ys lost What playsters haue I not to my infected body applyed? &amp; fynde no ease, this malady ys in my bones so setled, &amp; inward marrow, that yt's past all the phisitions skill to cure the same, &amp; there is none that wt h me medle will for they perceiue my carcas ys a carion &amp; no better: nay loathsomer then any carion, yf any thinge can be loathsomer. for no part's of me freshe &amp; sound, no part that's vncorrupted. no member but yt's full of Scurffe, &amp; wt h vlcers disfigured. Bunches &amp; boyles ryse in my face. the heyre of my head falleth. my voyce ys hoarse: blisterd my tongue, my eaten nose sore ytcheth. and I (pore catyue quite for lorne) my wynde can scarcely draw the passage of my breath so very strayte ys, &amp; so narrow. And my throte belcheth vp continually pestiferous smells wc h makes all the phisitions say wt h one voyce, that my bowells wt h in corrupted are. And at a worde the soundest parts of my whole body prickes, as though they stabbed were wt h darts. And (to augment my griefe) all they of whom I honoured was in health, do me contemne, &amp; ioy to see my wofull case: Yea &amp; (wc h grieues me most of all) myne owne wyfe doth abhorre me so much, that she thinks her selfe worst, when she ys in my company. And when shee sees me turnes her backe, or else doth runne away alleadginge for excuse, that busines will not lett her stay. If I at any tyme do desyre her wt h me for to lye, she makes continually delayes. yf I vse my authority &amp; her inforce there to, her face she doth beeray wt h teares wc h argues that litle good affection she towards me beares. Oh well were I if eyther shee felt sensibly my sorrow or that I cared not whether she did feele the same or no. But now when this disease paynes me the most (confesse I must) I much more am inclind, &amp; proner vnto fleshly lust. then I was in my health: The nature's such of my infirmity so that I feare her frowardnes encreaseth much my misery. Hard ys my happ of her to be the most of all abandoned of whom I should before all other haue bene belou'd &amp; cherished. And (wc h most pittifull ys of all) none of the gods regard me: none that geue eare vnto my sighes: none that my case do pitty: but deafe are when I on them call, &amp; my prayers despyse &amp; turne away their faces when I to them offer sacrifice. O Iupiter wt h what fault haue I thee so much offended that I deserue so grievously at thy hands to be punished? whom thou in former tymes wt h good successe so much hast graced &amp; honour'd wt h heroicall acts? where fore art thou thus altered? Oh! how inconstant, frayle, &amp; mutable is humane felicyty? How's he deceiu'd that groweth proud for fortunes smyle that's momentary? He trust's vnto a staffe of reede, on fortune that relyeth as by me may be seene, whom she so miserably deiecteth, &amp; headlonge hurleth downe from the top of the hiegh'st felicity in to the gulffe of endlesse woes, &amp; neuer dyinge misery, &amp; trampleth me vnder her feete after a most strange fashion. But yt's in vayne for to complayne, sith she's wt h out compassion. This womanish waylinge there fore I'l leaue of, for man vnseemly &amp; put th'armour of patience on. O that I were so happy! then should I feele no griefe but that wc h my disease doth bringe. But that ys hard to do, yea I feare an impossible thinge, the rather because that my wyfe, whom cominge here I spye doth dayly me vpbrayd there wt h as though I could yt remedy: Where as yt is not in my power. But here I'l stand asyde &amp; listen what she'l say, feareinge my looke she'l not abyde. Artemona. The more I geue eare to Phronesiums wordes, so much more luckely I hope the matter will fall out, wc h she related to mee. Naaman. What trusts she will more luckely fall out? vnlesse yt bee by plottinge &amp; deviseinge meanes how she may gett rydd of mee whom long synce shee began to loath, because of my disease. Artemona. And for her truth in other matters, her wordes me better please in this. And nothinge I by her aduise haue vnder taken at any tyme, but euer more yt luckely did happen. Where fore I'l now go seeke my husband out, &amp; to hym tell what shee sayd of the prophet, that doth in Samaria dwell, &amp; see yf I can hym persuade to make a iourney thither (though at his hands I nothinge looke for but a crabbed answeare.) Yet will I triall make, that yf he'l not my counsell take I may the stubburne felow charge wt h wilfulnes, &amp; make that an occasion to forsake both his house &amp; his company who might, yf that he would go thither, be cur'd of his infirmyty. Naaman. Lo, meanes shee seekes her selfe to free from me as I suspected wc h greues me more then all the paynes I haue this while indured. for then for aye I am vndone: &amp; so to be yt's lykely for all occasions she doth seeke how that she may get from me. Artemona. I know not where to seeke for hym. yet luckely I espy hym standinge here. I'l go &amp; tell hym as Phronesium bad mee. Naaman. She comes towardes me of her owne accord. this may be cronicled for she no sooner vs'd to see me but her backe she turned. I'l semblance make as though I had not seene her vntill now Artemona. Husband. Naam[an]. Are you there wyfe? I pray you what's the news wt h you? Artemona You come as fittly as I wishe, for wt h you I would speake Naaman. Wt h me? Artem[ona]. Yea sir wt h you. And now my mynd to you I'l breake. The matter weighty ys, &amp; for you sir exceedinge good, &amp; may effected be, So yt by you be not wt h stoode. And to be briefe yt's this. When yesterday by chaunce I talked of your infirmity wt h Phronesium, &amp; much your case lamented. Naaman. Nay thyne owne rather I beleeue, yf that the truth were knowne Artemona What do you interrupt me sir? then hence I will begone Naaman. I haue offended her yt seemes. Good wyfe I pray the tary &amp; tell me out thy tayle, for now no more I'l interrupt thee. Artemona On that condition I am content, or els I will be gone. &amp; if you heare me not the greattest hurt will be your owne. As I my griefe to her disclos'd wt h many a bitter teare complayninge that we two the wretchedst persons lyuinge were this day alyue, Ant first she wept wt h me, (as her became lyke to a seruant that was kinde &amp; carefull of her dame) wt h comfortable wordes of good cheare then she bade me bee &amp; sayd amongst other things she for our griefe had found a remedy for in Samaria there's a holy prophet cal'd Eliseus of vertu great, godly of lyfe, &amp; for strange miracles famous. Yf my lord will persuaded be by any kynde of meane to go vnto that man, he shall returne home sound &amp; cleane; where fore mistres moue hym there to: &amp; after on my credit you shall reioyce there at, &amp; thanke me who mou'd you first to yt. To whom speakeinge so confidently I began to geue eare though at the very first I thought her wordes incredible were. &amp; promis'd her I would impart the same sir vnto you as now I will. wherefore (husband) as euer you will do any thinge for mee, or as I haue euer geuen you content beinge partner of your ioys &amp; woes, to this motion consent Naaman. Lady alas you litle discreation shewe in counsellinge mee vpon a seely girls report, to take so longe a iourney Artemona Lo he ys in his olde vayne still of crossinge what I say Naaman. Yf thou were wyse thou would not haue me cast my goods away so vaynly wyfe, nor hazard myne owne lyfe in goinge thither but spare yt to mantayne vs wt h, while we here lyue to gether. except thou be in hope there wt h to make an ende of mee, wc h verely I do feare's thy drifte thou me persuads so earnestly. What haue I not (catyue for lorne) through thy intreaty done forc't by thy bawlinge there vnto, &amp; dayly exclamation Where as in the meane tyme, all th'oracles beinge demanded answeare &amp; say: I stryue agaynst the streame, &amp; do my selfe but weary, in seekeinge helpe for a disease that fatall ys vnto mee: &amp; yet (as though thou ignorant were there of, thou me intices to go I know not whither, by triffleinge tayles &amp; foolish circumstances. Artemona. Th'vnhappiest woman that lyues I am. How shall I thinke this man will euer be in any thinge rul'd by me, when as I can speakeinge for his good, not be heard, but make hym at me angry? &amp; yet he asketh what he hath not done at my intreaty? Are you not (sir) asham'd here of? verely you vrge me so that I can not be sylent now, nor scarce tell what I do. Did euer I any thinge desyre, but had there of deniall? Name one thinge yf you can, or else your wordes wt h shame recall What are you mute? well as you will. yf this lyfe do you please then rott for me, as you will shortly, for so threats your disease. yf once agayne I moue you then. Naam[an]. What lady are you angry? Artemona How should I husband choose, when as you weigh my words so lightly? &amp; they so much are for your good? Naam[an]. Good wyfe be not offended but well consider wt h thy selfe, that thy motions proceeded but from a foolish girle, who knows not what belongs vnto so great a cure, &amp; yet I must do all she byds me doe. Thinkes thou I so selfe willy am that I would not take counsell of you, or her, or any else that did aduise me well? &amp; further farre go then Samaria, &amp; seeke the prophet out yf he could cure my griefe? Nay I would go the earth about &amp; neyther spare for paynes nor cost, yf I might cured bee But there's no hope there of syth that I am past all recouery. Artemona. How can you sir be sure of that, vnlesse you first make triall? surely no way. where fore my counsell take, &amp; all things shall fall out as you desyre, or else I'l silent be here after. But here Phronesium comes as I could wysh. Let's call her hither. that you may heare her speake her selfe. perhaps her words will bee of greater force then myne, who knows he is a man most holy. Phronesium. I musen what the matter ys that I my lady saw not of all this day, except perhaps she busy be about the matter where of we talkt last night: And if yt fall out luckely (as I do hope yt will) none shall be happier then I verely. Artemona. Heare you her husband what she sayth? Naam[an]. Not I wyfe nor I care not. Phronesium But here I spye them talkinge both to gether: yf that I thought it were here of &amp; not about some other serious matter I would go &amp; persuade my lord for to be ruled by her this iourney for to vnder take: wc h will be for his good as he would thinke yf that as much, as I, he vnderstood Artemona. Do you yet heare her what she sayth? She's speakeinge of your iourney &amp; sayth yt would be for your good. Phronesium a word wt h thee. whither dost thou hye so fast? yf so be thou canst stay come hither. Phronesium I to the shambles goinge am meate to prouide for dinner Yet not wt h standinge I'l vpon you &amp; my lord attend. wishinge god would vnto his honour health of his body sende. Artemona That ys the thinge where of we talkt, for I haue hym acquainted what thou of Eliseus sayd: but my wynde ys but waysted Phronesium That am I sory for: but what makes hym refuse your counsell Naaman. Because I am persuad'd thy words are not so much as probable. And I would haue the know (phronesium) that well thou hast not pleasd me by puttinge in her head such things, as wt h me make her angry. Phronesium Condemne me not my lord, for I no such intention had &amp; yf you triall make you shall fynde all true that I sayd &amp; for the loue I beare to you, I there of her informed Naaman. I do not lyke such mayds as haue so much tyme to be spared from their worke as for to take care of other folkes affayres. &amp; that such as concerne them not. Phronesium yf thy cares were of thy distafe, reele, &amp; needle, &amp; such lyke things as these of wc h women only ought to medle, thou should me better please. Phronesium Alas (my lord) I thought It had a seruants part bene to medle wt h all things that they can for their maisters profitt do And what can be more for your good then your health to recouer? &amp; syth I know the meanes, why should I not the same discouer vnto my lady thats so sory for your distressed case, &amp; for the loue I beare to you? My duty sure yt was. Where fore so soone as I came to the knowledge of your griefe &amp; also heard that you by physick could not get any reliefe, this prophet vnto my remembrance came that's in Samaria &amp; of hym I my Lady told, wishinge wt h out delay that she would you acquaint there wt h, &amp; moue you to go thither And I the selfe same counsell now geue you my gratious maister. yea &amp; more ouer earnestly intreate you for to do yt for yt vndoubtedly will be for your exceedinge profitt. Distrust me not my lord in this syth euer you haue found me faythfull to you in all things else, &amp; also to my lady Naaman. Thinks thou he doth exceede in skill all other learn'd phisitions? then were yt pitty of their lyues. And their generall opinions are that this my disease in curable ys. where fore be sylent for both thyne &amp; thy Ladyes labour in this ys vaynly spent Phronesium Speake lookely (my lord) for fully I persuaded am this iourney will be for your good, yf you will take the same Naaman I can not so persuaded be, Syth th'oracles also haue answeard wt h ioynt consent, that no way's left my lyfe to saue Phronesium Yet for all that (my lord) take heart, for I will pawne my credit that if this iourney you will take, yt shall be for your profitt. Artemona. Her suite very reasonable ys (my lord) &amp; she speaks wt h great confidence where fore graunt her request both at her &amp; my earnest instance. &amp; if you fynde not good there by, do as you will here after Naaman No longer me persuade, vnlesse your reasons (wyfe) were better Artemona Why should we not persuad you (sir) you know th'olde sayinge well that one must first the nutts shell cracke before he eate the kernell So you my lord must first take paynes before you cured bee for the gods will not help you till you put to your owne industry. But syth that my intreaty doth no good, I'l hence be gone Naaman. Lo she her wonted byas keepes; yf all things be not done accordinge to her will. And for to helpe yt there's no way Phronesium Oh Lady be not angry at my lord, but wt h hym stay for I hope he'l geue you content, in all that you desyre Artemona Euen as he will, syth nothinge but for his good I requyre. yf will not the wurst is his: Choose whether he'l sincke or swyme Naaman wo's me pore wretch how violent hath this woman euer byn? &amp; yf you do gayne say her still, she will be much the worse. Phronesium wynne her wt h patience then, &amp; her no more here after crosse. And she (vnder correction) was I thinke at thys tyme worthy to haue bene borne wt h syth what she sayd was for your good chiefly. Artemona. Phronesium one would so haue thought. But so crosse he ys always that pipe what I list yet he'l daunce what doth his humour please But syth yt will no better be, in his filth lett hym rott for so he well deserues to do, who might be cur'd &amp; will not. And when he's dead, (as soone he will) yf he thus willfull bee some quiet I may fynde perhaps, or else wt h sorrow dye. wc h I had rather do, then lyue thus discontented euer But I'l begone, &amp; thou had best Phronesium follow after. for thou as soone an Ãthiops skyne wt h washinge white may make as that same willfull folow persuade this voyage to vndertake Naaman Heares thou Phronesium what a peale she runge me ere she went thou had best tread thy ladyes steps for feare lest thou be shent. yt's the only way to gett the a good husband quickly for men will ioy to marry wt h so quicke a dame I warrant the Phronesium The cause was her great hope you should thereby your health recouer else would she not haue bene my lord so earnest in this matter. And if myne owne eyes had not sene the prophet strange things do I neuer would haue moued her or you my lord there to. Naaman. Name one thinge yf thou can that worthy ys of admiration. Phronesium He made the bitter waters sweete of Ierico at the motion of the inhabitants there of: wc h sweete are till this day &amp; when a company of litle boys in mockry thus did say, vnto the prophet as he past by Bethell now of late in the hearinge of many: come vp bald pate, come vp bald pate: He lookeinge backe &amp; cursinge them in the name of our lord Two Beares from the forrest came, &amp; tore vpon my word fourty two of the ladds in peeces, to the peoples amazment Naaman. I feare phronesium of thy selfe thou doest but this invent to make me this longe voyage go: for this that thou doest tell in my opinion &amp; conceipt seemes not so much as probable. Phronesium It is as true as I do lyue: &amp; yet things that are stranger then these by farre were wrought by hym &amp; yt no longe tyme after. wc h yf I should recite to you, your selfe the same would say. Naaman. Stranger then these? It is impossible. Tell me what I thee pray. Phronesium. As this same prophet of whom I spake by chaunce through the streete passed where in I dwelt wt h many of the cittizens that hym folowed A certayne pore woman weepinge for the death of her late husband &amp; thrustinge through the multitude that did betwixt her stand &amp; the good man, fell at his feete, &amp; hym desyr'd to help her of the cause of thy griefe (quoth he) then let me be partaker. My husband (holy man) sayd she) out of this lyfe departed a vertuous man (as thou well knows) and not the least estemed amongst the number of the prophets. But he in debt did dye &amp; nothinge lefte behynde hym but two litle sonnes &amp; mee And now his creditour sayth he will take both my sonnes away from me his boundslaues for to be, vnlesse the debt I pay. Wc h yf he do all my's gone, &amp; I shall dye for griefe Wherefore I pray you holy prophet geue me some way reliefe. The prophet then mou'd wt h her teares vpon her tooke compassion &amp; askt her what substance she had at home? quoth she iust none, but one litle botle of oyle. Yet sayd he woman courage take vnto thee for by gods help I will relieue this thy want &amp; necessity. Go borrow of thy neighbours vessells so many as thou can gett &amp; beare them to thy house, &amp; when they are in order sett (thou &amp; thy sonnes beinge all wt h in) on th'insyde shutt the dore &amp; oyle till all the vessells be filde out of the botle power. At wc h wordes she vpon hym lookt, &amp; stood as one amazed till he agayne did bid her go, &amp; do as he commanded. &amp; warninge gaue her to be ware lest that her incredulity hindred the fauour wc h by god almighty was intended on her for to bestow. And though there at many there did wonder &amp; thought yt was a thinge impossible, yet she did as he bade her. &amp; many vessell gott together, &amp; caryed them all home Naaman And what at length I pray the was th'euent here of Phronesium? Phronesium Euen this: out of that litle oyle both the vessells all were filled &amp; she the oyle did sell &amp; wt h the money her debts discharged &amp; by that meanes also her sonnes from bondage were deliuered. Naaman. What's this I heare? yt is impossible wc h thou hast here related. But hear'st thou? tell me nothinge but the truth I pray the hartely for in my heart I hate a lyer, &amp; so did from myne infancy. Phronesium Alas my lord the tyme's to come that euer I deceiu'd you &amp; trustely I euer haue done all you sett me too &amp; thinke you now my gratious lord that in so great a matter as this wc h you concerns so much I am become a lyer? What pleasure would yt be for me to make you trauell Idlely so farre beinge so infirme, or cause you spende your money vaynly? It would but me discredit wt h you, to whom I am beholdinge more then to all the men, that in the worlde are this day lyuinge, &amp; still am lyke to bee: for no other mantenance I haue but that wc h from your loue proceedes: whose loue I still do craue where of I do confesse, yf I now lye I am vnworthy where fore my lord as earst you haue, you may now boldly trust mee And yf my wordes do not proue true, then cast me off for euer &amp; coumpt me for to be no better then a deepe dissembler. Naaman I sayd not this as though I thought phronesium thou dyd lye but because that the things so strange wc h thou related to mee. rather syth that I neuer heard that (our prophets I do not say) but our very gods them selues euer the lyke did till this day. Phronesium oh speake not of your gods (my lord), who no such thinge can do or yf they shoulde, yt's by the diuils meanes in outward show Naaman. phronesium thou no changlinge art, I do perceiue right well in so disdayninge of our gods. But yt's best take my counsell &amp; speake more reuerently of them, Lest thy mouth by &amp; by the stopp, &amp; their owne quarrell reuenge to the distruction of thee. Phronesium I am not so weake harted (though a woman) as for to feare your gods wc h are dume diuills, &amp; can neyther see nor heare. Neyther do I the diuills dreede them selues, wc h are accustomed by their mouthes for to speake, knowinge their power ys euer limited by the lord god of heauen, whom we Israelits adore for only he's the lyuinge god, who as he was creator of all things in tymes past: So now by hym all things are gouerned: &amp; his true seruants euer more in their distresse protected. And of his power I beseech you triall for to make as you me loue, or rather as you care of your health take. What in a study (sir?) follow my aduise &amp; confident bee &amp; yt shall neuer you repent yf you so do, beleeue mee. Naaman. Well then (phronesium) say no more: Thy counsell I will take, my case so desperate ys, that of all things I'l triall make. Phronesium Then do you wysely (my good lord). Right glad there of am I Naaman Now go thy ways, &amp; tell my wyfe that I'l be wt h her presently. Phronesium. I will my lord: And ioyfull newes yt will be to my lady who doth so much desyre your health, &amp; takes your sicknes heauenly Naaman. Though I be not througly persu'de, that this is true shee sayde &amp; lest I worse returne then I go hence, am sore afrayde Yet I'l make triall syth I poore wretch in to that state am come that I must be ruld by an others will, though yt be troublesome. for he that doth intend to lyue &amp; lead a quiet lyfe must euer more contentted be to be ruld by his wyfe. Yet I'l go craue the Kings aduise, before I take my iourney for there's no trust in women when as the matter ys so weighty. Sosia It seemes my lady doth but smale accompt of my worke make else would shee not haue suffered me this idle paynes to take in seeking vp &amp; downe the court all this day for her husband for there he hath not bene for ought that I can vnderstand. of purpose surely she yt did yf that the truth were knowne (her humour's such) to weary me wt h trottinge vp &amp; downe for feare lest I should idle be: So ouer thwart a woman I neuer saw in all my lyfe. She thinkes belyke a man a beast ys, borne to toyle &amp; moyle, as Asses vse to do for litle cares shee what yt ys shee setteth one vnto, so that her fancy be fulfild, she ys so shrew'd, &amp; angry, &amp; would the patient'st man alyue this day wt h brawlinge weary. And litle cares she who yt ys she chides wt h, or for what whether yt be frend or foe, good cause or bade, al's one so that her tongue may walke, as still yt doth. for when there ys no other to baule wt h, she spitts out her venome agaynst ye prince my maister her owne husband, who ys a man of gentle disposition &amp; her of anger would not geue the very least occasion yf he could choose. Wherefore I muse what makes her take dislyke wt h hym, vnlesse yt be (as I suspect) because he's sicke. by meanes where of he's weaker growne then he was wont to be &amp; so perhaps perform's his taske that she lookes for, to sparingly. Hence come her teares I'l lay my lyfe: this makes her for to blubber But hist, I here espye my lord Naaman cominge hither. Naaman. I goinge am towards the court to craue the kings aduise concerninge this my iourney, but he will hould me vnwyse I feare for geuinge credit (though but smale) vnto a thinge that so in credible seemes, vpon a seely girls relateinge. Sosia It seemes his mynde sore troubled ys wt h one thinge or wt h other he talkes so to hym selfe. I meruell much what is the matter Naaman. Who's there? Sosia? where hast thou bene? &amp; whither art thou goinge? Sosia At the kings court I was, &amp; there for you (sir) haue bene seekeinge for to intreate you from my lady to come forth wt h vnto her who fayne would wt h you speake about a great &amp; weighty matter Naaman. I'l come wt h out delay. But the kinge tell me, didst thou see Sosia Yes &amp; his grace determin'd was this way for to come presently. Naaman That's well. Begone, &amp; tell my wyfe I will forth wt h be wt h her. The cause she sendes (as I suspect) is about the olde matter for shee will neuer be content, till out at dores she dryue me by one meane or an other: for I dare not gayne say her verely she so out ragious ys. And yet I would not her permitt to haue her will, but that phronesium hath persuad'd me to yt, In whom some litle confidence I haue, though altogether I do not her beleeue. But whom espye I cominge hither? The kinge yt seemes to be. Yt's he indeede, this fals out well I'l wt h this matter hym acquaint, &amp; then desyre his counsell. Dreede Soueraigne lord all happines attend your noble grace Kinge of Syria. Naaman thanks. But I am sory to see thee in this case: &amp; wish yt in my power were any way for to relieue thee for the good seruice thou hast done both to me &amp; my country. Naaman. If any thinge I did that gaue contentment to your honour I am right glad, &amp; willingly would do my best endeuour your frendship to continue still: for both my lands &amp; lyfe should be att your command, yf I could gett cur'd of your griefe Kinge of Syria I doubt yt not (good prince) And yf thou canst of any thinge tell that may be for thy good, thou shalt haue my forterance &amp; counsell Naaman Your loue still more &amp; more makes me beholdinge to your honour where fore I briefely will, relyinge of your princely fauour relate vnto your grace that wc h a captyue mayde of Israell (who longe tyme hath me iustly seru'd) did lately to me tell seemeinge to pitty my distresse, as her teares playnly shewed Kinge of Syria Boldly so do. And many tymes the simple &amp; vnlearned a salue for some sores do fynd out, where of the wysest men &amp; such as were esteem'd the best phisitions, did neuer dreame. Naaman I wish (quoth shee) my maister would voutsafe to make a iourney vnto a prophet in Samaria, wc h ys my natyue country there of hys leprosy wt h out all doubt he might be cured And to add credit to her speech, very strange thinges she related, most confidently wc h he had done. And cause why she should lye I do know none, but much hurt would vnto her come there by Kinge of Syria It's true, wherefore Naaman go at all adventures thither &amp; triall make: perhaps thou may agayne thy health recouer. And then thy paynes were well bestow'd. And to suppose the worst yf thou do get no help thy paynes &amp; charges were but lost. And I will write in thy behalfe a letter to the kinge to be deliuered by thy selfe sealed wt h myne owne ringe. And syth there's daunger in delay to one that is in misery I'l go, &amp; yt indite, that thou may forth wt h take thy iourney. Wherefore Naaman come, &amp; let's no longer stay. Naaman Thankes gratious lord, I'l be at your command both night &amp; day. Strato. What tayle ys this (my lord Leonidas) that Bromea to vs told? a thinge where of I neuer dreamde, that prince Naaman could haue bene persuaded by a foolish gyrle to make a iourney in to Samaria so farre hence, beinge so weake of body, for he will neuer able bee to go thither on my credit Leonidas. Lord Strato yt's most true: Phronesium hath persuad'd hym to yt &amp; he ought not to be condem'd, yf he there to consent rather then lyue both night &amp; day (as he doth) in such torment for any one would in his case of euery thinge make triall in hope at length some hope to fynde, although yt were but small. rather then desperately dispayre, where in more torture ys then in the malady yt selfe, as many haue found ere this. &amp; wisht they had done other wyse, when that yt was to late. But you perhaps th'aduise esteeme that's sould at highest rate. yet scorne not theyrs that's easy prizd, or freely ys bestowed as her's, wc h thankfully ys geuen for benefits receiued Strato. It seemes the prince then in your iudgment's wyse for takinge counsell of such a seely wench, who hardly will a true tayle tell. Leonidas She's not so seely as you thinke (my lord) for where as shee a boundslaue was, for her good seruice now they haue made her free And nothing's at home or abroad but she performes yt well &amp; faythfully: why should they not then here in take her counsell? especially when there's great cause where fore she should not lye syth both her mantenance &amp; credit there on dependinge bee. Strato. You are deceiued much (my lord) yf so persuad'd you bee because phronesium altogether doth take part wt h her lady who of his company would fayne be rydd, &amp; thinkes (alas) this for to be the readyest way to bringe the same to passe. wherefore except the prince their counsell do reiect, &amp; stay at home, &amp; looke well to hym selfe, he'l be vndone for ay. Leonidas You are deceiud, my lord. But tell me why you do thinke so. Strato. vnto me then geue eare. In the late warres (as you well know) wc h wt h the Israelits we had, the prince hym selfe behaued so manfully, that no few of his enemyes he killed &amp; many captyue lead away, &amp; made the rest to flye, &amp; some do say Achab their kinge vpon his sword did dye. And as his valour was an honour amongst vs, euen so yt was a terrour to his foes, &amp; hatefull as you know. for naturally we wish their deathes of whom we stand in feare of our owne lyues, or by whom our dear'st frendes destroyed were. All wc h ys well knowne to his wyfe, wc h made her to suborne her mayde to moue hym for to go, in hope sound to returne, but vnderhand intendinge for to haue her husband slayne there by his foes: &amp; then she might be free to mary agayne some one that she doth better lyke. wherefore whyle yet you may preuent this mischiefe by intreatinge hym at home to stay wc h he will do at your request, he so entyrely loues you Leonidas I no sufficient cause do see to moue hym there vnto otherwyse I would (you may be sure) do my best hym to stay at home. But there ys litle cause of feare in that you say for although his good fortune was by his foes then much envyed yet now they are become his frendes, &amp; all iarres are appeased. Neyther hath his wyfe nor his mayde I thinke any such intention: but wish his health, &amp; of meere loue to hym haue made this motion Wherefore you do them wronge for to condemne them wt h out cause Strato. Well patronize them as you list, the ende will all disclose but yet here after do not say that you were not fore warned yf yt should yll fall out. But to admitt I be deceiued in thinkinge thus: are you persuad'd I pray you tell me seriously that he may cured bee yf he will vndertake this iourney. And do you thinke that all ys true related by Phronesium? Leonidas What els (my lord) syth shee yt saw ere that thence she did come Strato. Well be yt so: Tyme truth will tell, &amp; bringe all thinges to light But sure he should not go, yf hinder hym any way I might. for I feare yt's not for his good, as forward else would I bee hym forward for to sett, as you, Phronesium, or his laydy. Leonidas All perills yt's good to cast. But yet you should as well consider what good will come there of, yf he his health agayne recouer. for first the kinge a worthy generall of his warres shall haue, his lady a kynde husband, &amp; we all a captayne braue. But who be these that here be cominge? Strato. Yts Bromia our kytchyn mayd &amp; dorio the skull a very loyteringe lither ladd, as euer did on two feete go. It's mervell but thei'l iangle before they part. Let's stand asyde awhile &amp; here them wrangle Bromia Whither snekes thou now out of the dores so closly arrand knaue?

Dorio Then am I saffe enough, for thou no honesty hast at all where fore I'l go &amp; take a napp, happ after what hap shall Leonidas Now let's vnto her speake my lord, syth all the sport ys ended. Bromia Are you two there my lords, then of my selfe I am a-shamed. for brawlinge wt h this leysy lout, who ys as lither as longe &amp; I was forc't to beare wt h hym, though he did me great wronge. But I am glad you are both here, for my lord doth intend to take a iourney to Samaria, &amp; doth me for you sende to go wt h hym, &amp; that forth wt h, for so he ys determined Strato. I heartely do wish the prince would better be aduised for the iourney's to longue for hym haueinge so weake a body Leonidas I hope not so: but hence let's go, lest he do for vs tary Bromia. Is't true phronesium that the prince ys gone towards Samaria? Phronesium As true as I am here, for I saw hym set forward Bromia. [The next folio has been cut out.] Bromia Thinkes thou I will any thinge beleeue that thou to me dost say? No verely, no wherefore packe hence. Away, I say, away. I shall fynde tyme &amp; place enough to be revenged on thee Dorio Well then I see that in a woman there ys no sparke of mercy but syth intreaty will not serue, nor my suite graunted bee hanginge or grindinge in the mylne I feare will be my destiny &amp; grinding's worse then hanginge farre, for one turne off the ladder will ende ones paynes, but grindinge ys payne that continues longer. where fore yf I can steale from her I will my selfe go drowne hange, or from the topp of some Tower throw my selfe head longe downe. &amp; breake my necke, for any of these three I thinke a man had better do, then lyue still in subiection to a woman. Bromia. What dog pater noster's that wc h to thy selfe thou there art mumblinge? Dorio None Bromia: I do come but lyke a dogg that goes to hanginge. Naaman. I fynd Leonidas by experience that nothinge ys so easy but yt will seeme hard vnto hym, that doth the same vnwillingly for this voyage of yt selfe ys neyther paynfull nor vnpleasant &amp; yet I weary am, &amp; do begyn for feare to faynt. lest both my labour &amp; my cost in vayne bestowed bee Leonidas Take courage to you (worthy prince) all things will fall out luckely for my mynde geues me that your paynes &amp; charges shall be recompensed wt h the recouery of your health: where fore be not discouraged but chearefully go on. Naam[an]. Art thou persuaded so Leonidas Leonidas I make no doubt there of: for the gods will I hope concurre wt h your endeuour, but see you do all things to your honour. Naaman Or else yt shall of ignorance be. where fore I craue your counsell Leonidas By my aduise then see (my lord that you reward hym well that pleasures you, &amp; neyther cost nor charges see you spare for mens affections by that meane the soonest gotten are. &amp; then they will the readyer be to do for you agayne when for one good turne they expect an other to obtayne Naaman. for that cause I haue wt h me brought as I before you told Ten talents of white syluer, &amp; sixe thousand crownes in gold wt h change of rayments of great worth, for I care for no charges So that I may my health recouer by liberall expenses for that cost ys not cast away, the wc h ys so be-stowed Leonidas Your honour sayth right well: &amp; for yt you'l be much esteemed. But now we are come almost to the citty: where fore yt's fittinge that some body be before you sent for to take vp your lodgeinge &amp; a chamber ready made agaynst your cominge thither &amp; stables for your horses also that are folowinge after. Naaman That's not amisse my lord. but where thinke you that we shall gett an honest man to be our guide vnto the holy prophett? Strato. Your honour shall neede none yf to the kings court first you go &amp; your letter to hym deliuer, as the kinge bade you do: for doubtlesse he will you instruct what's your best course to take at the sight of hys graces letter, yf not for charity sake. Naaman Lord Strato your aduise I'l folow, &amp; go to morrow mourninge to the kings palace wt h Leonidas, &amp; leaue you at my lodginge. till my returne. come let's away: Leonidas you alone shall wayte on me, the rest shall go before to make prouision Strato How now Syrus are all thy horses drest, &amp; packes vp layd saffly both vnder locke &amp; key, as thou commandment had? that thou so early gaddinge art abroad this morninge, tell me? Syrus They are my gratious lord, &amp; that my weary bones can testify wc h almost broken are wt h bearinge them, theyr waight was such Strato Did not the horses beare the packes, that thou complaynes so much? Syrus Yes by the way my lord: but I them loaded &amp; vnloaded. But now I hope I shall fynde ease: &amp; vnlesse that be graunted no longe tyme I shall trouble you. Strato. Why wilt thou runne away? Syrus Oh no my lord: that neuer was my meaninge, truth to say. Strato Be lyke then now thou lyest, yf thou neuer meant the truth to vtter Syrus. mistake you me agayne? I'l make you vnderstand me better. yf your lordship will geue me leaue: I streight way shall be dead if I drudge thus, &amp; then you shall no more wt h me be troubled. Storax And I am in litle better case my leggs so weary are wt h dablinge through the myre &amp; dirte after the packes so farre, &amp; for want of my mournings draught my stomacke ys almost gone Strato Comfort your selues rogues for your bellyes shall filled be anone wt h wyne &amp; dilicate cates, yf that the prince his health recouer Storax Hey day my heart all ready ys, a pound at the least lighter.

Alas pore rogues! comfort your selues, for I was but in iest go stuffe your skynnes wt h beare and wynne, &amp; that euen of the best, this mourninge to styrre vp your spirits Stor[ax]., Syr[us]. Our hearts then you haue wonne for euer more, come let's be gone as fast as we can runne. Kinge of Israell. Most worthy prince Naaman I am glad you here to see though very sory that you are so infirme of your body How doth the worthy kinge of Syria, my frende, your lord &amp; maister Naaman. He's well my liege, &amp; to your grace hym kyndly doth remember: And hath this letter by me sent vnto your royall maiesty hopeinge that the contents there of your grace will not deny. Kinge of Israell. Know Kinge of Israell that Naaman this my seruant I haue to you sent to th'ende he might be cured of his leprosy. What's this? Thinkes he that I am god that can kill &amp; geue lyfe that he hath sent this man that I might cure hym of his griefe? That he occasions seekes against me now yt doth appeare The very sight here of makes me my garments off to teare. who able ys such speeches to endure? Sure I thinke none wherefore lest into greater passion I fall, I will be gone. Naaman. for euer more I am vndone. Alas what shall I do? to whom shall I for succour flee? woe's me whither shall I go? The matter's come now to thys passe that yf all men should lay their heades to gether me for to help, they can not tell wc h way. O heauen! o earth! o cruell fate! I am so much disquieted that I can not tell where to rest? the king's so discontented. Alas into what misery am I fallen pore wretche man &amp; how to free my selfe there of, no way diuise I can. yf I here stay, I am in feare my lyfe they will take from mee. yf I returne, I must wt h shame for euer lyue in misery. And there ys none to whom I may this my great griefe impart not to Artemona my wyfe, lest she me ouerthwart. Nor to phronesium my mayd, who by her crafte &amp; subtilty the only woman was that me persuaded to this iourney. And my frendes will laugh at me, yf they once there of should heare because I to a seely wench so easely gaue eare I do confesse to late alas, that I was yll aduised when I tooke counsell of them two, &amp; was but shollow witted Or else I had fore seene their guyle, &amp; yt preuented to. O flatteringe wyfe! o vnkynd mayd! what made you thus to do? Wyfe yf I had not loued thee, thou might me thus haue serued &amp; so might thou phronesium yf that I had not the trusted. But why do I complayne of you? I rather should be angry wt h myne owne selfe who you beleeu'd. But I pay for my foly. How many occasions gaue you me you for to haue suspected yf that I had not senslesse beene, or else by you enchaunted. The gods offended are wt h me, I verely beleeue for that I sett them not at light but did them credit geue O Iupiter am I the subiect of thy fury made O fortune could thou frowne on none but me? now I persuade. my selfe that they this plott did lay to gett ridd of my company &amp; yet I had not so good happ as to preuent their knauery. I thought the kinge of Israel would haue taken my lords letter in better part, &amp; not haue bene mou'd there wt h vnto anger. What will my liege say when he heares there of? I feare yt will sett them to gether by the eares, &amp; make them much blood spill on eyther part, for doubtfull ys th'euent of warres, for hee ofte goes home by the weepinge crosse that goe away wt h victory. But much I musen where Leonidas ys, whom I appoynted my cominge here for to expect. I feare he ys informed of th'vnkynd welcome that I had, &amp; then gott hym away Leonidas My lord the prince appoynted me here for hym for to stay but he hath me preuented as yt seemes. Alas what ayleth hym for to wringe his hands so pittifully? some thinge hym troubleth. Naaman. Leonidas are you there? I was afray'd you had bene gone heareinge of my distressed case, &amp; lefte me here alone. Leonidas Be that farre from me (worthy prince.) But what hath you dismayde? tell me my lord. Why speake you not? wherefore are you afrayd? Naaman I am (Leonidas) quite vndone: &amp; there's no hope of remedy Leonidas Why what misfortunes you be fallen? Briefly my good lord tell me. Naaman My lyfe in damige ys Leonidas. Leon[idas]. Your lyfe? the gods forbid what ys the matter my lord? Nothinge I pray you from me hyde Naaman. My cure's not only come to nought, but thinke yt well I may yf I, infected as I am, escape wt h lyfe away. Leonidas These circumstances lay asyde (my lord) for they much fright me. Naaman Well then I will. To the kings court I went from you directly &amp; at my cominge thither hee most frendly me saluted: but when the letter he had read, wc h I to hym deliuered, he by &amp; by fell in a rage, &amp; his garments did teare &amp; lookeinge on me frowningly, sayd, to my griefe &amp; feare: Thinkes your kinge I am god that hath power for to kill &amp; saue alyue? or doth he send this man vnto me for to haue hym cured of his leprosy, as though I were omnipotent? O impious act! I pray you marke yf he haue not intent to pyke a quarell agaynst me that he might invade my country? Leonidas Out &amp; alas! what's this I heare? yt falls out toto strangely Naaman Thinke you leonidas that I was able to speake a word? No, no, my heart did was as could as any stone my lord. Leonidas It was no meruell worthy prince: to heare yt I am frighted Naaman At length beinge full of sorrow, my selfe away I thence conueyed Leonidas O misery! It's a true sayinge: that trouble sooner happeneth &amp; griefe of mynde vnto a man, then that wc h he desyreth. Naaman. Alas pore wretch I am, of how great hope am I now frustrate? &amp; yet I do know no cause why, vnlesse yt be for that I am borne miseries to endure. But where fore stay we here so longe with daunger of our lyues? for that I hourely feare. And all my expectation's gone of gettinge health agayne. Now that my wyfe &amp; mayde haue cosned me yt ys most playne, &amp; that through their most subtill witts, &amp; longe practised policy for they are full of shiftes &amp; prone vnto all kynde of knauery. Leonidas Oh wo ys me! I dye pore wretch. I know not what aduise to geue hym, syth all thinges so crosly happ, &amp; farre other wyse then I did thinke they would haue done, or any man haue imagined. Naaman. Come let's away wt h out delay. But whom here spye I cominge from the kings court? Let's runne away, &amp; saue our lyues by fleeinge. Leonidas Oh no my lord, I pray you stay. what can one single man &amp; he vnarm'd be able for to do agaynst vs twayne? you were not wont to be afrayd in the midle of your foes. What then dawnt's you so now, when as the odds on our syde goes? Naaman. It's true you say, yet yt's our best to get vs hence away lest we to late repent. At your request yet I will stay. Melchias I neuer saw in all my lyfe the kinge so much distempered as at this tyme: But yt was well the prince so soone departed &amp; place vnto his anger gaue wt h silence very wysely lest he had into greatter passions growne &amp; bene more angry. Naaman Lo the man of his anger speakes. I am vndone for ay vnlesse the gods do bringe me helpe, for wc h I humbly pray. Melchias But now a messenger from Eliseus sent hath hym appeased &amp; I am sent to comfort hym, who yt seemes ys sore frighted Leonidas. O happy newes! do you not heare what the man sayth my lord Naaman Yes well: &amp; I some what reuyued am at that very word. though all my feare ys not expelled quite yet from my heart Kings speeches were to me so bitter, sharpe, &amp; ouerthwart. Leonidas Take courage (syr) &amp; to hym speake: I hope all well will bee Naaman. I will. wellcome my frende. what newes at court, I pray the tell me Melchias Whom haue we here? It euen ys the prince for whom I sought See how the pore man trembles yet, he was in such feare brought. Naaman. Is't me you woulde speake wt h. Melch[ias]. yes wt h your selfe renowned captayne Naaman What's be come of my goods? I pray the tell me yf thou can. Melchias Be of good cheare for all are saffe: and the kinge now ys pacifyed Naaman. I hardly can thinke so my frend, so throughly he was angred but yf his fury were asswag'd some what, I should be glad Melchias All daunger's past vpon my credit, wherefore be not afrayd Naaman O happy newes (yf yt be true) but how may I beleeue yt Melchias after the kinge departed was &amp; gone out of your sight his fury did continue still. But at the length there came to hym forth wt h the prophets man, &amp; did appease the same. Naaman. I pray you tell me how that I may geue credit there vnto Melchias Surely my lord I must confesse, yt was wt h much ado, yet he effected yt at length, &amp; thus. O kinge (quoth hee) my maister Eliseus wt h remembrance of his duty lets your grace vnderstand by me, that no iust cause of anger your maiesty had to haue bene offended wt h the straunger that was from Syria come: or your garments for to haue rent but rather should the pore distressed man haue to hym sent that by experience he might fynde that prophets are in Israel that able are to cure his griefe, as your grace knows right well Leonidas What ioyfull newes ys this I heare? Naam[an]. I longe vntill I do heare (good yonge man) what answeare then the kinge made there vnto. Melchias At first he sylent was, &amp; one word spake not good or badd but afterward when that his choler &amp; passion were alayd he turninge towards me did say: Melchias go thy way &amp; call the prince of Syria back agayne wt h out delay &amp; tell hym what the prophet sayd: Thus spake his grace my lord wc h so soone as I heard, I runninge came to bringe you word. Naaman. O Iupiter continue still these fauours I beseech thee towardes me as thou hast begune, &amp; then I shall be happy. But tell me is this true thou sayst, or am I in a dreame. Melchias Do you yet doubt there of (my lord)? To lye I do not meane All though I but a pore man be, I care haue of my credit &amp; will no vntruth tell, though I might gayne a kingdome by yt. Naaman. I you commende, &amp; credit geue vnto your wordes yonge man. This smale remembrance take to recompence some part of thy payne &amp; kyndnes to me shew'd: &amp; better you shall be rewarded here after if I lyue, &amp; be agayne to health restored Melchias Nothinge (sir) I will take, vnlesse that my paynes had bene greatter Naamon. If you loue me deny yt not, for you deserue a better Melchias well then I'l take't wt h thankes, &amp; euer be at your command but let's be gone lest your owne good wt h lingringe you wt h stand. &amp; I'l conduct you to the prophets house, that's not farre hence Naaman Thankes my good frend I'l go, &amp; this thy kyndnes also recompence. I well perceiue to my great ioy, the kings countenance towards me ys chang'd, for he before did frowne but now he looketh on me chearefully &amp; frendly bade me go vnto the house of Eliseus wc h is this same that standeth here, for so Melchias told vs. And opportunely I espy his man now cominge hither I'l hym salute. My frende well mett: I pray you where's your maister? Giezi He ys wt h in (most worthy prince) &amp; heareinge of your cominge he me commanded wt h this message to come vnto you, sayinge: Go wash your body seuen tymes in Iordan, &amp; restore you yt shall to as perfect health as euer you had before. And so in hast (syth that occasions draw me hence) I'l leaue you Naaman Immortall gods: how sodaynly are my ioys turn'd to sorrow? Alas I thought the prophet would hym selfe haue come vnto me &amp; invocateinge his lord god, wt h his hand touch't my body &amp; so haue cured my disease. But yt seemes that he will not voutsaffe to come out at dores, but sent one of smale skill (as you sawe) for to bid me go, &amp; wash my selfe in Iordan seuen tymes &amp; I shall be restored vnto my health agayne. T' is a ridicolous thinge, &amp; vnlyke for to come to passe. perhaps he thinketh that wt h some madd dogg I bitten was &amp; not wt h Leprosy infec't, &amp; there fore he did bid me to washe me in the ryuer Iordan, &amp; so cur'd I should bee. Are not Pharphar &amp; Abana Riuers of Damascus better then all the waters that in Israell bee? And there fore hither I neede not to haue come, yf washinge had for my disease a remedy beene. But this Iordan (yf yt for sooth do please the gods) shall make me whole, &amp; none but this. It's a meere fable for my disease so deepe ys in my flesh, that yt's not possible yt should be washed thus away: where fore (my lord Leonidas) let's forth wt h hence depart, for to my griefe I see (alas) that whither so euer I do go I hated am or mocked Leonidas. Oh no (my lord) I wish that you would better be aduised. for yf to do a greater thinge the prophet had you bidden yt were your part (my lord) the same for to haue vnder taken. for yt a wyse man doth become all maner of things to try both greate &amp; smale rather then lyue always in payne &amp; misery Naaman. Why do you thinke Leonidas that I may only by washinge be cur'd? Surely in my conceipt yt's an vnlykely thinge. Leonidas Dyspayre not worthy prince, for weaker salues haue often cured more desperate sores then this of yours beinge fitly applyed sooner then sharper medicynes could haue done: &amp; there fore folow the prophets counsell, &amp; I hope much good yt will be for you. Naaman. Leonidas thinkes thou so? And Storax what ys thy opinion? Storax It ys no greate paynes lost my lord yf you try this conclusion &amp; seuen tymes in Iordan wash your body as he you bade. the cost ys none: the labour litle, &amp; the triall's quickly made. When out of Syria you did come you fully were resolued to do all thinges that by the prophet should be you enioyned what paynes or cost so euer yt requird, were yt lesse or more. And will you backe returne agayne (my gratious lord) before you triall make of his wordes after your iourney that so costly &amp; paynefull was? &amp; that wc h he enioyns you ys so easy? What will your mayd Phronesium say? How'l your wyfe you vpbrayd when they perceiue that vaynly you haue this longe iourney made, to your great cost &amp; home returne as infirme as you went? &amp; heare that you might haue bene cur'd, yf you had bene content your selfe t'haue washed seuen tymes in the riuer of fleame Iordan &amp; you would not so do? Then will you wishe you there agayne to late (alas) wt h shame &amp; griefe. Where fore be ruled now by reason while you yet are here: &amp; the prophets counsell folow. wc h eyther will be for your good, or else will you excuse. To make this short experiment then (my lord) do not refuse, while opportunity fitly serues, because you know not whether the same will offered be to you agayne euer or neuer. Naaman You wish me both then for to go &amp; washe me in that floode Leonidas., Storax. We do in deede, &amp; doubt not but yt will be for your good.</field>
