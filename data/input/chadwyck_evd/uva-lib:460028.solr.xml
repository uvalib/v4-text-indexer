      <field name="fulltext">BELISARIUS. A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? vivite fortes, Fortiaque adversis opponite Pectora Rebus. Hor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable General WEBB.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE: Spoken by Mr. RYAN. So hard the Task the Tragic Muse ordains, Few find Success, with all their Skill and Pains. If Time and Place and Action they observe, From Plot and Character the Authors swerve. Nor these enough, shou'd even these prevail, In noble Thoughts and Energy they fail. Can we then please in so polite an Age? When Sense and Learning only fly the Stage. We only sink, and are debas'd in Wit; That you improve, we to your selves submit. Of Judgment so exact, of Taste so nice, Nor Play, nor Woman can engage you thrice. Not ignorant of this, with real Fears, Our Author, conscious of Defects, appears. The following Scenes he offers to your View, Nor dares your Censure, nor can meanly sue. But hope not Towns besieg'd, and Battles fought, And in one Play ten diff'rent Stories brought. And sure the Stage shou'd still be chaste and clean, From Deeds of Horror, and from Words obscene. Such Conduct with th'ignoble Crowd obtains, But gives you Torment, and deforms the Scenes. A plain and single Tale we represent, Nor with Digressions maim the chief Intent. Happy the Man! who shall reform the Stage, Improve our Judgment, and refine the Age. But humbler we raise not our Thoughts so high; To Rules you dictate, chearful we comply. Submit our Labours to your just Decrees, Proud to be taught, and happy cou'd we please.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE: Spoken by Mrs. BRETT. Hold, are you Mad?âso I'm oblig'd to tell ye, A famous Poet once instructed Nelly. Epilogue to Tyrannic Love or Royal Martyr. Forgive, if great Examples we pursue, Weigh the Respect that to the Dead is due. But we in vain to rival them pretend, And what pleas'd then, perhaps may now offend. These wiser Times their Ancestors deride, And diff'rent Maxims your Behaviour guide. Then Wit cou'd thrive without the mighty Aid Of Conjurers, nor dreaded Masquerade. There was a Time when Love and Honour sway'd, The Youth was faithful to the yielding Maid. Th'Exchange was only throng'd with plodding Cits, And Lords then condescended to be Wits. We made the Great for Sustenance our Quarry, Nor were we forc'd for Countenanceâto marry. The Ladies then, tho' not so fair as you, Therefore excepted; for if Fame says true, They liv'd, and lov'd, and didâjust as you do. Then was the TimeâHang those Pedantic Days, What we ne'er imitate, why should we praise? Yet should we praise the Maxims you pursue, You would be lothâthe Devil should have his Due. For so mysteriously the Moderns wound, We think they praise us, when we are lampoon'd.â Fearful our Praises you should mis-conceive, The artful Theme to other Pens we leave: Dull nauseous Flattery shall be suppress'd, No Laughter sought by some indecent Jest. Our Muse with waggish Epilogue disdains, Instead of Farce, to close the Tragic Scenes. Let others thus hunt mercenary Fame, Debase the Stage, and wrong the Poet's Name; We hope an Audience of a juster Taste, Where Vice and Nonsense are alike disgrac'd. We hopeâoh may our Hopes find bless'd Success! That some will mourn for Virtue in Distress.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Scene of Action is at Constantinople. An Anti-Chamber of the Palace. Enter Hermogenes. He comes, the happy Belisarius comes, Adorn'd with Conquest, and with Laurel crown'd. In golden Chains Kings swell the glitt'ring Pomp, And Chariots bend with Loads of foreign Spoils. Confusion ravages the crouded Streets; Wild Uproar reigns, and Discord wounds the Air. The Infants strein their tender Throats to cry, The Sky resounds, great Belisarius comes. The Peasant throws aside his Ax and Plough; The Merchant leaves to tempt the angry Main; Nor is the greedy Bar litigious now. Nor for a thankless Master has he fought. Justinian studies to repay his Toils; Valeria is design'd his great Reward, And Pow'r and Honour will attend the Gift. What then, Hermogenes! remains to thee? Obscur'd by him, my Grandeur soon will fade. For, me he hates, and scorns the Tricks of Courts. The Arts and Wiles which purchas'd CÃ¦sar's Grace, First Fav'rite late, chief Minister of State, Will nought avail me, Belisarius here. Fame has no Tongue but in the Victor's Praise. Then He or I must fall; both cannot stand. The Choice is easie, but the Means are hard. Enter Macro. But see! my Heart can entertain some Joy; Welcome, my Brother! welcome, to my Arms! This to the Ties of Blood, to Friendship this. Mac. My ever honour'd Lord! Brother by Blood, My Friend by Choice, a Parent in thy Care. The Rank I hold, the Fortune I possess Are owing to the wise Hermogenes. Her. I long'd to see, to press thee to my Breast. But wherefore, Macro, hast thou left the Pomp, Forborn thy Part of this triumphant Day? Thy Sword (if Fame deceives not my glad Ears) Hath reap'd thee Laurels, and shou'd share the Praise. Mac. Let the wild Rabble roar, I fly their Praise, And with Disdain I hear th'acclaiming Croud. Me other Thoughts molest, me Cares oppress, And drive me to thy friendly Arms for Aid. For Aid to thee I fly, thy Censure dread. Thou wilt upbraid my Weakness, scorn my Griefs, Think me Justinian's Foe, nay think me thine, When in this universal Rage of Joy, Thou shalt behold my Face obscur'd with Gloom, And catch me smothering a broken Sigh. Her. Is Belisarius, proud of his Success, Unmindful of thy Worth? he wou'd defraud The Soldiers of their Due, and haughtily Engross the Glories which their Arms have gain'd. Mac. Oh were he such! I then had room to hope. Not the first CÃ¦sar was in his Resolves More firm, or flew more swift to execute. Not Fabius was more wise, more circumspect. Never was Man more lavish of his Blood In Glory's hot Pursuit; the Conquest gain'd, Joyful he gives the Soldier their just Fame, He shares the Fame, but yields them all the Spoil. Thus just, thus wise, thus brave, thus fortunate, Modest and temperate; yetâmay I speakâ Her. Boldly. Mac. Thus then; I envyâ Her. On. Mac. I hateâ Her. More yet. Mac. Detest, and wou'd to Death pursueâ Her. Say, Belisarius. Mac. You have sav'd my Tongue The Shame of naming him,âbut him I hate. Her. My Brother! in thy Bosom dwells my Heart. There is Alliance in our Minds; our Blood, Our Thoughts, our Wish the same: I too detest This boasted Warrior, Minion to blind Chance. We will unite our Forces, to the Earth Lay low this lofty Pine, and from his Head Will tear the Laurel which we cannot blast.â But say, whence springs thy Hate! Mac. Why shou'd I blush? Of what am I asham'd? when I pursue Great Nature's urgent Law; that prompts me on, That breaks all Mounds, and leaps o'er ev'ry Fence. Oh Love! oh mighty Love! thee I obey, At thy dread Altars bend; thou hast defac'd All other Thoughts; my only Sovereign Thou! Her. Love is the Cause! a Woman is concern'd! In Courts and Towns luxurious, Love presides. Not the rough Warrior free! not Camps exempt! Busie, alluring Plague! pernicious Joy! Woman moves me too, but Ambition more.â Of that at leisure Hours.âthy Story now. Mac. I need not tell (our Parent Italy, O'er-run with Goths, a wild and num'rous Herd, Contemning Peace and desperate in War) That Belisarius, bless'd in all Attempts, In Triumph late return'd, Africk subdu'd.â Her. 'Tis needless this, and irksome to my Ears. Too well I know his swift Success; how soon His Fortune or his Skill in Arms o'erthrew The Gothic Pow'r, which near an Age prevail'd. His magnify'd Defence of Rome, one Year Enclos'd with hostile Troops; how thence he drove The Gothic King, the warlike Vitiges Back to Ravenna, his proud Capital, Forced him to Terms, and thou the Hostage sent. Mac. Thence springs my Hate, from thence my Griefs arise. Oh had I been condemn'd to toil in Mines, To Exile sent, depriv'd of darling Sight! Thee fair Almira I had ne'er beheld, Nor made my Fame a Sacrifice to Love, To fond, insulting, to desponding Love. There I beheld thee first: caught with thy Charms I strove to mediate Peace; rejected that, For Vitiges, thy Father mildest Terms Procur'd; unprofitable Service found! The Victor, Belisarius, he alone Was worthy thy Regard. For him disdain'd, In vain I sought to move thy haughty Mind; Fled I pursue, rejected I adore. Her. And Belisariusâowns he too her Pow'r? Mac. Who can behold, and yet resist such Pow'r? Oh fatal Beauty! oh resistless Charms! Guard well thy Heart, fly her inchanting Voice, Dare not to view so elegant a Form, Avoid the Lustre of her radiant Eyes, Or in the Lover I shall lose my Friend. Her. Does Belisarius then resign his Heart, And love the Daughter of the Roman Foe? Imprudent Choice! Note that Hermogenes.â Already I have spy'd the Path which leads To gratifie Ambition and Revenge. Not all the Statesman's Forecast, all his Art Cou'd have contriv'd a Scheme so apt, to hurl This tow'ring Belisarius from his height, As Chance hath careless offer'd to my Thoughts. Men may boast Wisdom, it is Chance invents, Chance gives the Hint. Let it suffice, if we Can take the Hint and form it to our Use.â But Proclus comesâthe Gen'ral's Favourite. Mac. Sent to know where the Pageantry must end. This Anti-Chamber is th'appointed Place. Enter Proclus. Her. Change we our Language then and sooth his Pride. Hail worthy Proclus! let me fold thee here, And shew I share the Joy thy Eyes divulge. Pro. He were no Friend to Honour, Justice, Truth, No Friend to CÃ¦sar, or the Roman Name, If Joy dilated not his Breast this Day. Again the Roman Name is great in Arms, To Heav'n ascends, with former Splendor shines, And Rome again obeys her rightful Lord. Her. When Belisarius leads, Fortune submits, Or charm'd, or aw'd, no various Goddess she. He wars secure, fated to Victory, Belov'd of Heav'n and deify'd by Men. Justinian delegates to him his Pow'r, And wisely sits supine, dull Business scorn'd. The Name of CÃ¦sar justly is forgot, 'Tis Belisarius fills all Mouths, all Hearts. Pro. Well, I perceive thy Aim; thou do'st propose Invidious, to extol his Name too high, And ruin by exaggerated Praise. Thy Taper dim and faint appears, expos'd To his bright Rays; he justly holds first Place In CÃ¦sar's Breast. Repine thou Macro too, That fair Almira hears thy Love with Scorn. Combine in Hate, employ the Courtier's Loom, Smile, fawn, betray, use all insidious Arts, Weave fine the Snare, but see the Twines are strong, Arachne's Web so bars the Eagle's Flight. Her. Unkind Return! unjustly you suspect: Yet this provokes not, nor abates our Love. Shou'd Belisarius entertain such Thoughts, 'Tis decent to retire, lest we offend His Sight, and damp the universal Joy. [Exeunt Her. and Macro. Pro. I never view that Face without Distaste: His Looks alarm my Soul, and bid beware. Men say, the Visage shou'd no Credit findâ Erroneous Thought! Nature, direct and plain, Stamps on the Face the Purpose of the Mind. The good or bad Intentions of the Heart Work out, and on the Visage are display'd. The Traytor Look, which shews the Traytor Heart, Is then the honest Look; fair warning gives And bids us not confide. If then we are Deceiv'd, blame we our fond Credulity: Our Vanity and Pride enslave our Reason, And yield us captive to fallacious Tongues. But heark, the Trumpetsâ Belisarius comes. Enter Belisarius in Triumph, &amp;c. Vitiges and Almira. 'Tis CÃ¦sar's Will I shou'd attend you here. [To Belisarius. Plac'd on his Throne, to grace your Triumph more, He will receive you with conspicuous Joy. I go, to notifie your wish'd Approach. [Exit Proclus. Bel. I do not, Vitiges, condemn your Grief, Of Pow'r divested and in Triumph led. But blame not me; blame your malignant Stars, Your adverse Fortune, Fate or what you will; I only execute what CÃ¦sar wills, He bids me war, Custom ordains this Pomp. Vig. I blame not you, nor of my Stars complain; Reproach and Censure fall on me alone. My Brows surrounded with a Diadem, The Purple from my Shoulders flowing loose, Thus regally adorn'd I shou'd have dy'd, In the tumultuous Breach I shou'd have fall'n, And born my Honours spotless to the Grave. Bel. A brave Defence of Towns besieg'd, a wise Retreat equals the Conqueror's Renown. But, oh Almira! when I view thy Face O'erspread with Care, when I behold those Eyes, Those Heav'nly Eyes, which wont to chear my Soul, Now bent on Earth and swol'n with pearly Drops, My Glories I renounce, my Triumph hate, Asham'd of Conquest, grievous to thy Peace. Some Merit I may boast, some Favours claim For Service pass'd; Justinian wise and good, Will hear my Pray'rs and will restore thy Peace. But see the Door unfoldsâCÃ¦sar appears. Trumpets. The Scene draws. Justinian on his Throne, He descends and embraces Belisarius. Jus. Come to my Arms, to my Embraces rise. Welcome, my Soldier! Atlas of my State! More than Supporter, the Enlarger Thou! The happy Instrument of Heav'n, to give Our Empire Peace, and subjugate her Foes. Bel. My Triumph is compleat, my Joys are full, When such Reception You vouchsafe to give. Chearful the Soldier toils, undaunted fights, Secure of Recompence in CÃ¦sar's Smiles. Jus. Be witness all, let every Nation know, From ev'ry Nation thou hast purchas'd Fame, How dear, how high thou art in our Esteem. Thou scarce canst add to what I owe thy Sword, Nor canst demerit by hereafter Deeds. The impious Wretch who dares infuse Distrust, Envy or Jealousy in our just Mind, Pulls sure Destruction on his miscreant Head. But say, my Warrior! wou'dst thou ought require To shew our Love, to prove our Gratitude? Bel. Encourag'd thus: allow me to present This Royal Pair, Objects of Clemency. This Vitigesâhis lovely Daughter this. Let them not pine in sad Captivity, Assuage their Sorrows and pronounce them free. Jus. Kind and benevolent are thy Demands, And but anticipate what we resolv'd.â Be freeâBe ever from this Moment free. And if there may remain to recompense The Loss of Empire and of sov'reign Pow'r, When Belisarius asks be gratify'd. But to the Temple let us now proceedâ Your Presence is not necessary there. [To Vitiges. There shew our Transports, there compleat our Joy. Imperfect is our Joy, 'till we have paid Our holy Off'rings at the Shrine; just Debt. For Gratitude but in the Will design'd, Brings sweetest Comfort to the honest Mind. [Exit Justinian. Bel. Proclus, my Friendâmy Duty calls me hence, [To Vitiges. Will shew the Palace order'd to your Use. Constantinople now can vie with Rome. The Sons of ancient Rome have oft beheld Princes beneath their hospitable Roofs, Who sought Protection and implor'd their Aid. Nor is their Glory yet so far impair'd, But still they hold a Rank which Princes seek; The greatest Kings to CÃ¦sar sue for Grace, And glory still in the Patrician Name. If I have Pow'r, that Dignity is yours, With Affluence to live in Royal State. May this prevail to mollify your Cares! May this deface the Injuries of War! And when Almira deigns to say she loves, Nor Goth nor Vandal shall exceed her Pomp. The Gold of Africa shall pave her Way, And Asia's Gems shall blaze around her Head. Alm. Whence springs the Pow'r of Love! whence fly his Darts! Mysterious Cause! involuntary Flame! The King my Father conquer'd by your Arms, Victorious ever! Both in Triumph led, This shou'd raise Thoughts repugnant to soft Love. And yet I cannot hate, and when I say I cannot hate, I then confess too much. Bel. I cannot ask, nor can you grant too much, When faithful honourable Love demands, And by a Father authoris'd that Love, That Blessing only can compleat my Joys, And in that Blessing terminate my Pray'rs. Alm. A Virgin's Pray'r shou'd be to guard her Heart, And spend her Days in Innocence and Peace. The Joys of Love are pompously describ'd, She, fears the Tryal artless and unskill'd, And checks the Passion fatal to her Rest. The Hind surveys the Stream with wishing Eyes; But all around the Hounds and Toils descries. Prompted by Thirst, but more compell'd with Fear, She flies the Taste, where Danger is so near. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Scene continues. Enter Justinian and Belisarius. Jus. To thee the Soldier's Merit best is known, To thee I give full Pow'r of Recompence. The Treasury shall answer thy Demand, Ample and Royal be the Donative. Bravely they fought and freely we reward. Bel. And Vitigesâ Jus. And Vitiges shall be Declar'd Patrician. Say, is there ought else? Bel. CÃ¦sar, too bounteous, leaves no room to ask. My Fellow Soldiers' Service recompens'd, My Promise giv'n to Vitiges perform'd, Compleat my Wishes and o'erpay my Toyls. Jus. Thy bounteous Mind for others seeks Reward, Unmindful of thy self; but we not so. To be a Debtors suits not our high Place. Raise thy Desires, swell thy aspiring Thoughts, And take a Gift which Kings have sought in vain. Bel. Too well I apprehend the fatal Gift. [Apart. Already I am rais'd beyond Desert, I seek no more, secure of CÃ¦sar's Love. Jus. Long have I griev'd, and with paternal Care Beheld my People vex'd and hurt by Laws Incertain and confus'd. I meditate To rectify that Ill; superfluous Laws Rescind, the dark explain, the good affirm, To have the whole digested and compil'd. Laborious Task! Ages to come shall reap The Benefit, and by these Pandects taught, Justice shall be distributed, and Men Shall bless the Work; the Cares of Government, The Providence of War divert those Thoughts. Take thou those Cares; repell the barb'rous Foe, Retrieve Rome's Glory, and enlarge her Bounds. Bel. With Envy Men behold the Rank I bear; Encrease of Pow'r will sharpen more their Tongues. Jus. Despise their pointless Darts, themselves they sting. To strengthen yet thy Title to such Pow'r, To bring thee nearer to my self, and fix Thee ever there, Valeria shall be thine, My belov'd Sister; fair too she is held, Taught to obey, instruct her thou to love. Bel. Oh far am I beneath the Royal Dame! Oh let not CÃ¦sar thus debase his Blood! Jus. Think'st thou I am unmindful of thy Worth? Think'st thou, I can forget my Empire rescu'd (Almost o'er-whelm'd) from the insulting Arms Of haughty CosroÃ«s and Cavadas Proud Persia's Kings?âOr the inhumane Huns, A monstrous Race! by thee subdu'd, dispers'd? Then shook my Throne, when Pompey and Ipatius (Rebellious Pair!) with thirty thousand fell Beneath thy loyal Sword.âSicilian Nymphs No more had sung our Praise in sweetest Strains, Had'st thou not forced them to new-string the Lyre, And taught the fertil Island to obey. Who can relate? hereafter who believe Thy rapid Conquest o'er the fiery Soil Of Africa? in four revolving Moons Reduc'd; where the fierce Vandals were o'ercome In one great Day; and Gilimer their King Thy Captive made, in Triumph hither brought, Spoils more immense and rich old Rome ne'er saw. And now another Foe, the Goths submit, And now another King in Triumph led. Own I these Truths, and shall I not reward? Bel. My Services deserve not such Reward. I must oppose, Valeria will oppose A State for me too high.âAlmira oh! [Aside. Besidesâ Jus. No moreâI will not hear thee speak In Derogation of the Man I love. Valeria knows my Will; and as she ought Approves the Choice.âBy my Appointment, see Enter Valeria. She comes, prepar'd to ratify my Will. Valeria! worthy Object of my Care! Ever observant of my Will! receive This grateful Gift. Be in each other bless'd! I have disclos'd the Secret of thy Heart, Shewn where that beats, to save a Virgin's Blush; Love oft dilates the Heart, but flies the Tongue, And hates to be beheld by foreign Eyes. My Presence may incense the froward Boy, Disturb your Thoughts, and check your mutual Joy. [Exit Justinian. Val. Brother and Emperor has a double Right To claim Compliance and dispose of me. Nor is my Sex, nor is my Birth Excuse For Disobedience to his high Commands. Bel. Be he for ever scorn'd, ever accurs'd, Who seeks to gratify his Love by Force, Or wou'd by Pow'r compell the Fair to yield. The Force of Arms to Empire may give Right, But Love is ever unconstrain'd and free. Val. Weak sordid Minds are dazl'd by the Glare Of Wealth and Power; unnecessary Aids, When Merit such as yours puts in her Claim. Bel. All I have done, all I aspire to do, Are more than paid, when you vouchsafe to praise. Val. Who can oppose Virtue so manifest? Envy abash'd retires to her dark Cell, Her Snakes are folded and forget to hiss. Bel. Such unexampled Goodness I behold With Wonder, and at awful Distance bless. Val. He understands me not, or shuns my Love. [Aside. Our Sex indeed are pleas'd with Sovereignty, Proud to survey the Lover trembling stand And distant sue for Grace. Perhaps my Birth Requires such Forms;âbut CÃ¦sar has forbid. You may approach, and you may speak unaw'd. Bel. Oh aid me Love to speak, yet not displease! [Aside. With Awe and with Respect profound, I must Approach great CÃ¦sar's Sister. You are plac'd So high, so far above my lowly State, I dare not give Ambition so much Scope. My Heart shall still be fill'd with Gratitude, And Duty and Obedience ever pay. Val. What means this Language? Whence is this Reserve? [Aside. Obedience, Duty, Gratitude, Respect! Such Terms indeed become a Subject's Mouth. But there remains a Word, artfully shun'd, They say comprises, nay exceeds them all. Bel. 'Twere highest Insolence to mention more. Val. I grow alarm'd, suspicious of my Shame. [Aside. The Calmness of your Mind well suits Respect. And cold Respect is all you have to urge? Bel. Oh Grief of Mind! oh my distracted Soul! Oh royal Virgin! oh divinely Fair! Let not so mean an Object move your Wrath, Look with Compassion down on my hard Fate! Neglect this Heart!âCou'd I with loss of Lifeâ Val. Talk not of Life, too well I understand. Have I debas'd my Birth, disgrac'd my Sex, And meanly su'd to have my Heart receiv'd? Thankless to me! preverse to CÃ¦sar's Will! I vainly thought my Birth this Distance caus'd. And what is Pride believ'd Humility. Artless, I thought the Gift wou'd be more priz'd, The Value more encreas'd, granted unfought: And so it wou'd, in noble gen'rous Minds. Insolent Man flies when we meanly sue, And with Contempt rewards our proffer'd Love. Bel. 'Tis not my Will, 'tis my unhappy Fateâ Val. 'Tis Fate or Fortune causes all our Woes. Proud, partial Man ne'er owns himself in Fault, But Heav'n arraigns for Punishment deserv'd. Sure I have sinn'd beyond the common Course, Subjected to Indignity like this. And yet in this I merit not Reproach: I pay Obedience to the Sov'reign Power. Bel. Your dread Displeasure is my deepest Grief, And makes me curse the Triumphs of this Day. Val. Triumphs you curse attended with a Gift So mean, as scorn'd Valeriaâdown my Heart! Nor was the Triumph of the Day compleat, 'Till she was number'd in the Captive Train, The Wages of the War.âBut ere the Day Be yet consum'd, Valeria may find Means To shew a just Resentment of such Pride, Scorn in her turn and be implor'd in vain. Bel. I fear to speak, lest I shou'd more offendâ Wou'd you vouchsafe to hearâOh Love assist. [Aside. Val. Hear what! to have the Injury encreas'd, And told in formal Speech I am despis'd. No, I will hear no moreâleave meâawayâ And with thee take each tender Thoughtâbegon. [Exit Bel. bowing. True he is gone, but foul Disgrace remains, Shame and Confusion, with the slighted Maidâ Shame and Confusion!âOh wou'd that were all! A stronger Passion rages in my Heart. Perhaps I drove him hence too soon?âoh no! In his Demeanour, in his Eyes I read Careless Indifference, cold Neglect and Hate. Coldness, Neglect and Hate I cou'd have born, Had I not been mis-led to own my Loveâ Oh anxious Thought! Torture! to be refus'd! The Peasant, Slave, the Poor, the Old wou'd rage At such Return, to have their Passion scorn'd. Can I be calm? first Princess of this World! Justinian's Sister! in my Pride of Bloom!â 'Tis false; I am some Beggar's spurious Brat, Old and deform'd, and odious to the sight.â Oh I cou'd tear my Hair, beat this fond Breast, Summon the Furies to inhabit there, Expel this Love, and aid me in Revenge.â Revenge! alas! so punish me in him. The sudden Anger of my Sex blown o'er, The native Tenderness returns. And Love Smiles at my Threats, and dares my Rage. Fierce Man May rage and give his baleful Passions scope, And execute his Wrath with Fire and Sword. Poor feeble, injur'd Woman knows no Arms, Seeks no Redress, but by submissive Pray'r, And only hopes for Ease in Tears and Sighs.â Enter Hermogenes. Flow then ye Tears! fly my expanded Breast Ye throbbing Sighs! Attendants of my Shame. Her. Valeria weeping! unexpected sight! Forgive me, Madam, if your Slave presumes To ask the Cause, and wonder at your Grief. Val. What have I done? I publish my Disgrace, Betray my Weakness by unwary Grief. [Aside. Whatever is the Cause, unfeign'd true Grief Loves Solitude, and hates to be beheld. I wou'd be private now.âRetireâYet stay. 'Tis a vain Thought to have the Cause conceal'd. Perhaps my Weakness orâperhaps his Prideâ Aside. Perhapsâalas! too sure it will be known. Hermogenes is wise, and may assist. Say I shou'd tell thee whence my Sorrows rise, Would'st thou then aid, at least conceal the Cause? Her. Can such a Blessing be reserv'd for me, To aid divine Valeria in Distress? Val. Not me alone, the Emperor is serv'd, Justinian righted in redressing me. In me the Majesty of Rome is mock'd; My Sex, my Birth, all joyn to claim Revenge. Revenge on him, whose Blood, devoid of Heat, Beats low, and freezes when I own my Love.â Oh my unbridled Tongue! But who so wise To say enough and not too much? I aim'd To shew my Anger, and I slide to Love. What need I more? my Thoughts stand all expos'd; If thou art wise, if brave, advise, redress. Her. Honour'd with CÃ¦sar's Confidence, I guess Your Grief. I stand astonish'd and amaz'd, That Belisarius from such Beauty flies, And to Almira blindly yields his Heart. Val. What! does he love? oh aggravating Ill! Were he averse, insensible to Love, I cou'd forgive his cold Neglect of me. To have another in my wrong preferr'd, Adds to my Shame and Grief; and Woman's Pride Improves my Anger, and inflames me more. And yields he sudden to a foreign Love? Mine was of elder Date. Ungrateful He To all Advances Decence wou'd allow! My gentle Sighs were vain; in vain my Eyes Threw tender Glances; careless he beheldâ Alas! my Eyes shot feeble pointless Darts, Barren of Love, fruitful alone of Tears. Give way my Grief! let Rage possess my Heart! Point thou the Way to right this slighted Heart. Her. He stands a tow'ring Height, his Basis firmâ And yet he might be taughtâif you approve. Val. Oh! doubt not me, be sure I shall assent. Her. True he's my Friend, my Benefactor he. Val. And what the Emperor, and what am I? Her. From me the Method may seem strange and harsh. Val. Not harsh, not too severe. Her. So it may seem. Yet that I am his friend, his faithful Friend, Will best appear shou'd you pursue my Scheme. So weak the Mind of Man, nor Good nor Ill When in Extreams is born with Fortitude. Thro' long Prosperity he has forgot Or Chance or Fate, both servilely obey. He must be taught that he is mortal. Val. How! Her. Subject at least to Change. That Wealth and Pow'r By Fortune are dispos'd, not the Reward Of Merit ever. Soon the Gain is lost Of long, laborious, ignominous Years. He merits all that CÃ¦sar can bestow, Yet Some Affliction teaches to be wise; So shall he learn Obedience to your Will, And own your Beauty, as your Pow'r, supreme Val. You Politicians love to speak in Terms Obscure, perplex'd.âDeclare at what you aim. Her. Suppose him now, on this triumphant Day, His Lawrels green, elated with Success, Suppose him suddenly displac'd, disgrac'd. Val. Displac'd! disgrac'd! Her. His Mass of Treasure seiz'd, Reduc'd to Want, and mark'd with Infamy. No common Punishment or Grief will move His haughty Mind.âJudge how I prize your Peace, When thus I sacrifice the Man I love, My Friend, my dearest Friend, to give you Ease. Val. I know not how to give Consent. Her. Your Pow'r Is absolute o'er CÃ¦sar's Will! 'Tis kind To cheek his Pride, and stop some wild Designs. Val. The World will tax us with Ingratitude. Her. The World! alas! the World can ne'er judge right, Compos'd of Knaves and Fools. Who wou'd restrain Their Appetites for popular Applause? Or bear a Moment's Pain, to gratify The wild, the thoughtless, the ignoble Herd? Mark Belisarius, by the giddy Crowd Ador'd, pursu'd with deafning Peals of Joy; His Praises yet suspended in the Air, The Sound of grateful Tribute to his Worth Not yet extinct: Divest him but of Pow'r, Of CÃ¦sar's Love, that clam'rous Rout with Joy Wou'd shout his Fall, and hiss him to the Grave, Val. Love he with-holds with CÃ¦sar's Favour grac'd; For Injuries, tho' short, will he not hate? Her. His Fall divulg'd, to me he has Recourse, His Bosom-Friend. I shew his Pride, Neglect, His Insolence, Ingratitudeâ(forbear To frown, a Friend must always be sincere.) Point out the happy Way to be redress'd, And ere 'tis Night, I throw me at your Feet, And humbly sue to have his Love receiv'd. Val. True, the Temptation's strong; and yet I fearâ Her. This Method cannot fail, 'tis easy, plain. Val. Well if I can prevailâ Her. Of that no Doubt. Val. I goâYou must impart Justinian's Will. Her. Obedient ever.â [She going, and returning. Val. And in gentlest Termsâ Her. I wound my self when I displease my Friend. Val. In private speak, it may afflict too much To publish his Disgrace. Her. Confide in me. Val. Distasteful is my Task, perplex'd my Fate! To win his Love, I counterfeit my Hate. I dread the Means which to my Aid I call, And with reluctant Joy behold his Fall. [Exit Valeria. Her. And when a great Man fallsârise when he can. Honour once soil'd, the Lustre ne'er returns. This exceeds HopeâChance is my Goddess still! In gentlest Terms, in private speakâno Doubt. Ha, ha, ha. Credulous, easy, thoughtless Sex! Good Tools, Fit Instruments to ruin and destroy, Guided by skilful and judicious Heads. Left to themselves, like Frigats under Sail, Goodly to see, without the Pilot's Care They drive on Sands, or bulge upon the Rocks. The Woman gain'd, the Man's Destruction follows. To make it surer, Vitiges must joyn; The heavy, surly Goth, by Grecian Wiles Defrauded, no Augean Task, shall aid, And make Revenge compleat, and fix my Pow'r. Seated on high, secure I will look down And view the Ocean cover'd with the Wreck. Pleas'd with the Storm, deride my sinking Foe, And hear the Surges vainly dash below. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Scene continues. Enter Hermogenes and Macro. Her. Hast thou inform'd the Goth of my Desire Mac. You are obey'd. Expect him soon. Her. 'Tis well. Then, Belisarius, dread thy Fate. To be Displac'd is not enough; a petty Ill. Thy Vigour may cast off the Winter Slough, And with fresh Beauty in the Spring appear. I must pursue the Blow. Benum'd and cold The Adder I will seize, and crush him dead. Mac. Now, my Hermogenes! now shew thy Love, And make me bless'd. Justinian has declar'd That Belisarius shall Valeria wed, To thee no doubt well known. The News dilates My Heart, and I partake the gen'ral Joy. Her. And whence thy Joy? Mac. Almira may be mine, Woud'st thou confirm the Emperor's Resolves, And influence Vitiges to give Consent. How the Thought charms! then wert thou kind indeed. Then Belisarius glut thy self with Pow'r; Let Europe, Afric, Asia sound thy Fame, No Envy stings my Breast, Almira mine. Her. 'Tis strange, must Folly still adhere to Love! Mac. Let Folly, Madness, Want or Plagues attend, Love I pursue, my Guide, my Aim, my Prize. Her. Away, go vent thy Rant in Woods and Wilds. Such Rapture is offensive to my Ears. Mac. And can a Brother then refuse me Aid? Her. Thou art not of my Blood; allied to me, Thou wou'dst reject all Passions, ev'ry Thought Injurious to thy Int'rest; worship there, Let that predominate, make that thy God. What! sway'd by Love! why thou hast Friendships too! Childish and ignorant! Women thou think'st Have Constancy, and Men have Gratitude. Vers'd in the World, thou, to thy Cost, wilt find All are Betrayers and are all betray'd. Mac. These grave Refinements are not proper now. Cost what it will, I must possess my Love. Her. What! at Expence of Pow'r? why Lucifer Drew half the Host of Heav'n t'espouse his Cause, So tempting is the Bait of sov'reign Pow'r: They of Ãtherial Mold. How then shou'd Man, Gross Man resist? the Ape of Angels fall'n. Mac. There are no Joys but in Almira's Arms. Her. Why I love too; for 'tis my Interest To love. I wou'd possess too her I love, But 'tis to gratify my self. With Views Like these, a wise Man may indulge the Flame. Mac. You seek another, yet obstruct my Love! Her. Nature or Custom makes me hold thee dear. Besides, 'tis advantageous to us both To join in Friendship; Friendship then may last. This spreading Tree once fill'd, the sickly Plant Depriv'd of Air, debarr'd the genial Sun, Recovers Strength and shoots into the Skies. Enter Vitiges. See Vitiges appearsâretire a while. But be at hand, thou too must bear a Part. [Exit Macro. While fawning Crowds have sung the Victor's Fame, [To Vitiges. And scornfully beheld your captive State; While CÃ¦sar glories in a Realm regain'd, And Belisarius giddy grows with Height, I have retir'd, and mourn'd and wept your Fate. Vit. In Courts 'tis rare to meet such gen'rous Minds; Fortune rules there, and guides their Love and Hate. Her. Fortune has thrown me in the bustling Court, A Place ill suited to so calm a Mind, And full of Snares to my incautious Steps. Where base Ingratitude has Birth, and vile Dissimulation reigns; where Sycophan's Are only held for Friends; where Lyes prevail And stifle Truth; where momentary Shifts And Tricks for Wisdom pass, and Pride surmounts And sweeps the Palace with her gorgeous Train. Vit. Princes behold their Errors in Distress, And like me wou'd reform too late. To me It matters not how Courts are fill'd; But this I feel, whatever Cares attend the Prince, If dispossess'd, he ne'er tastes Comfort more. Her. A helpless, unavailing Pity shews Like Pride, and seldom is sincere. Methinks Pity from my mean State, sounds insolent. I wou'd be useful, I wou'd serve, assist So excellent a Man, so good a Prince. Vit. Such I was once esteem'd. A Captive now, A Slave; and with my Pow'r my Praise is lost. Her. And are the Appetites to rule destroy'd? Have you forgot the Pleasure of Command? Can you now beg, accustom'd to bestow? Vit. Why dost thou strive to rowze my drowzy Mind, And bring back hated Objects to my Eyes? Why paint the Pleasures I can only view, And why improve the Pains I undergo? I search Content in dull Forgetfulness, My Mind seeks Peace, and Memory forbids. Her. Content! can Princes have such narrow Views? What is that thing Content? Freedom from Pain? To be divested of all Appetites? To have no Wish? Useless, insipid State! If to be happy is to be content, In Happiness the Dog excells the Man, The Worm excells the Dog, the Block the Worm. Content! a low and lazy Excellence, For Drones to exercise in lonely Cells; A Stranger to Society; in Schools 'Tis gravely taught, in Practice never found; In Courts, in Camps, and at the Bar unknown. By Hermits plac'd in Solitude; but who E'er courted Solitude, but thro' Disgust? No, give me Griefs, Anxiety and Pain; For sweetly intermix'd with Joy, they give A poignant Relish to my Appetite; Then I luxuriant feast, am rapt in Bliss. What Lover is so dull who knows not this? Why flies th'Adulterer the lawful Sheets And courts a Brothel Love? In hot Pursuit Why is the Lion chas'd? caught in the Toyls With Ease. Why is the noble gen'rous Steed Strain'd to pursue the tim'rous Hare? The Pains, The Hazards, and the Difficulties charm. And Man, shall spritely, sociable Man Confine his Wishes to ignoble Ease? Vit. A State my Soul disdains; but what Redress? Her. The bold and daring Soul ne'er doubts Redress, And rarely fails when Prudence is the Guide. Base Treachery indeed may interpose And frustrate both.âPerhaps I may be thoughtâ Vit. No thou art honest; thou art sure too wise To be a Knave, too gen'rous to betray. Her. To see a King in Triumph led, in Chains, To feed his Conqu'ror's Insolence and Pride, With Indignation swells my honest Breast. And here your Misery is but begun. Think what it is to drag, to wear out Life, Meanly dependant on another's Smiles. To court the Emp'ror, on his Fav'rites fawn, Subservient to Buffoons and Parasites. Vit. It galls, it shocks;âYet CÃ¦sar has declar'dâ Her. Alas! Justinian is not known. 'Tis true His Justice and his Temperance are fam'd. But subtile Ministers when they proclaim The Prince's Wisdom, but extol their own. His Virtues are but feign'd; inconstant, rash, Severe and proud, to Flatterers a Slave.â But I proceed too farâI am too freeâ It is my Nature's honest Faultâtoo plain. Vit. You cannot please me more; I pray proceed. Her. I meditate a Wayâwou'd you assistâ Vit. I wou'd be foremost in the brave Design. Her. It may seem strange to scrupulous weak Minds. But what is brave, what Wisdom but Success? Rashness and Folly barter then their Names. Freedom obtain'd no matter by what Means, Empire in view, the Method is approv'd. Vit. To keen my Wishes to regain my Crown, Too sensibly I feel my wretched State. If thou art wise, describe the happy Means To shake off Servitude, to mount my Throne. If good, no longer hold me in Suspence. Her. Suppose the fair Almira were bestow'd On Belisarius, he declar'd your Heir. Vit. I have approv'd, Almira will consent. Her. With Patience hear. Suppose the Army too, Won by his Merits, or seduc'd with Bribes, Espous'd their Darling's Cause; supported thus, With Ease you may reject the Roman Yoak, And Belisarius give Justinian Law. Vit. His Faith to CÃ¦sar wou'd transcend his Love. Her. But put the Case. What Recompence were due, Were such a deep Conspiracy reveal'd? 'Twere Justice to restore your conquer'd Realms, And add Encrease. Justinian cou'd no less, Nor shou'd I fail to urge his Gratitude. Vit. 'Tis hazardous, 'tis base, beneath a King. Her. Nay, I advise not. It concerns not me. I am contented with my humble Lot, In Council to preside, and turn and guide Justinian's Will. Howe'er judge of my Love, Which points the way to Liberty and Pow'r. And wou'd in tenderness to you prevent Your being crush'd when Belisarius falls. Vit. You much amaze me; Belisarius fall! Her. At once he falls, to Want, to Scorn reduced I bear the Emperor's severe Decree. He vainly thinks, you credulous believe, His Virtues, Services, not to be summ'd, Have fix'd him ever in Justinian's Love. Have you forgot, when Subjects grow too great, Their Merits thought beyond all Recompence, That Princes either must resign their Pow'r, Or act with base Ingratitude. Sad Choice. Such is Justinian's Case. He seeks Pretence To justifie the Ruin he designs. Vit. Strange! Belisarius sink! his Shield! his Arm Her. It is resolv'd. See where he comes with Croud Surrounded; false, degen'rate, servile Crew! Mark how the rav'nous Herd, lowing for Food, Will shun the Waste, and fly the barren Land, And spurn the Pasture where they lately sed. Retire and hear, then judge what Course to take. [Exeunt. Enter Belisarius, follow'd by several Officers. Bel. You need not, Fulvius, be at farther Pains. Rely on me; this Fault shall be forgot; I know you brave, but learn more Temperance. Ful. May I but live to shew my Gratitude. Bel. Decius! your Courage shewn at Rome besieg'd, With Rome is recompens'd. You govern Rome. Dec. Beyond my Hopes! accept my humblest Thanks. Bel. You lost your Equipage in the late Storm, Murellus! you love Show, it suits your Youth; This Order will repay your Loss tenfold. Mur. My Gen'ral's Favour is my greatest Wealth. 1 Off. Excellent Man! [An Officer whispers Belis. 2 Off. How nobly he bestows! 3 Off. He stays not to be ask'd. The manner charms Beyond the Gift. 4 Off. How gracefully he moves! 1 Off. Has he spoke to you yet? 2 Off. No, but he look'd on me and smil'd. 3 Off. You are a happy Man. I shall catch his Eye presently. Bel. Virtuous and fair, you say, and nobly born? And yet your Father will not give Consent? Cot. For, she is poor, a helpless Orphan left. Bel. I am her Father, I adopt her mine. I saw thee Cotta, on Sicilian Plains Do Wonders with thy Sword. She is my Care. So tell thy Father; to endow the Maid, What he demands, I charge my self to pay. Cot. You give me more than Life; not she I love Can sway me from the Gratitude I owe. 1 Off. Observe his Words, how elegant they flow. [Another whispers Belisarius. 2 Off. What Fancy in his Dress! worn with what Ease! 3 Off. Hush! he observesâhis Eyes were turn'd this way. 4 Off. Happy the Man still present to his Sight! 1 Off. Might I but live to shew my unfeign'd Zeal, How I adore his Worth! I shou'd die pleas'd. 2 Off. The Virtues of our boasted Ancestors Are all compris'd in him. And when he dies The Roman Glory is expir'd. 3 Off. 'Tis true. To give him Life, we all wou'd die. All. All, All. 4 Off. Silence, he speaks. Bel. And hast thou, Rufus, serv'd, So many Years beneath my Banner fought, And I no better known? Hast thou no way To feed Ambition, or thy Avarice; But to traduce, to carry Tales, inform, And darkly wound the Man thou call'st thy Friend? Awayâsuch an Offence shou'd be chastis'dâ Yet, for thou hast complain'd of Poverty, Lest that shou'd tempt thee to proceed in Ill, This Order will enable thee to live. Enter Hermogenes. My Fellow-Soldiers! these are CÃ¦sar's Gifts, From our just Emperor these Bounties flow. His Coffers when exhausted, what in mine Remains, freely command. The solid Joy Of Wealth and Pow'r is in Beneficence. All. Our grateful Tongues shall ever sound your Praise. Her. Short Praise; or I am much deceiv'd in Man. [Aside. Draw near my Friends! You warlike Men attend! While I denounce the Emperor's Decree, Aloud and publick. So he gives Command; Not but it grieves my Soul I should be sent To damp the Joys of this auspicious Day, And clip the Victor's large aspiring Wings. Harsh to my Tongue: CÃ¦sar must be obey'd. Bel. If harsh to me, constrain thee not to grieve. I know thy envious Thoughts, thy thankless Mind. To me thou ow'stâbut I reproach thee not. Speak CÃ¦sar's will. Her. Then know, thou artâundone. The Emperor Justinian has declar'd From all Command, all Pow'r thou art dismiss'd. Bel. May CÃ¦sar live for ever!âyet 'tis strange. Off. How! what! Bel. What wou'd my gracious Master more? Her. What the Offence I know not, great no doubt, Or this might well suffice. Sentence is pass'd, Thy Lands, thy Goods, all that thou cou'dst this Morn Call thine, are all confiscated, all seiz'd. Bel. What, stripp'd of all! Her. So CÃ¦sar has ordain'd. And if I can prevail, these worthy Men, These gallant Soldiers, they shall the share the Spoil. 1 Off. Most wise Hermogenes! All. Command our Lives. Her. I can but pity you, and humbly take my Leave. [Exit Her. Bel. Insulting Man! all seiz'd! displac'd! disgrac'd! 1 Off. Well, I always said it wou'd come to this. 2 Off. I have foreseen it long, I knew it cou'd not last. 3 Off. Last! how shou'd it? ever guided by Fools, A Prey to Knaves, encompass'd with Flatterers, An honest Man cou'd not approach him. 4 Off. You know it was always my Opinion, That there was something odd, something melancholick, Something fatal in his Looks. 1 Off. How poor a Figure now! how mean! 2 Off. Did you not observe how handsomly Hermogenes delivered his Message, And how kind to us? 3 Off. Oh there's no Comparison. Well, I wish we knew who is to succeed him, That we might be early in paying our Compliments. 4 Off. Let us enquire. We have no Business here. [Exeunt Officers. Bel. So soon deserted! what, not one remain! How quick this Storm has blown away these Flies! Why let him seize my Palaces, lay waste My Land, and to these Wretches give my Wealth. My Honesty, my Virtue is my own, Thank Heav'n! innate, by Practice too confirm'd, Beyond the Reach of wild despotick Pow'r. Is't possible? Valeria! can it be? Can thy Resentment make thee so severe? And can Justinian yield to my Disgrace? Are all my Services forgot?âthis Morn, This splendid Morn beheld me first of Men, Bless'd and applauded as my Chariot drove, And by my Glories CÃ¦sar was obscur'd. And now, the Day not yet consum'd, behold Me last of Men, abandon'd and despis'd! Oh why is Man compos'd of such vile Stuff! Reduc'd at once to Beggary!âhard Fate! Who now will ope their hospitable Doors, And shelter Belisarius from the Cold? Who slake his Thirst? who spread the friendly Board To give the famish'd Belisarius Food, Or with an Obolus relieve his Wants? And yet, Almira! I repent not Love, For thee I suffer, and for thee will die.â Alas! to thee I shall grow odious too. In all my Pride of Pomp, my Glories fresh, Love found no Ent'rance to thy Virgin Heart. Off, off ye faded Laurels from my Brow! Ye grievous Monitors of what I was. Away, thou gaudy Robe! superfluous Load! Go mix with Dirt, encumber me no more! All Ensigns of my short, mock Triumph hence! Enter Almira. Alm. How swift is Fame when she depreciates Worth, Or scornful publishes injurious Truths! Bel. Almira here! now, now receive thy Fate! Alm. Who shou'd precede Almira to condole, When Belisarius suffers for her sake? Justinian loudly has declar'd his Wrath, Neglected Love is punish'd with Disgrace. Bel. The Blow is sudden; unprepar'd the Mind, Afflictions deeper sink; and yet I cou'd Collect the Man, cou'd bear with Fortitude All Ills which Malice can invent. But when I think, how much the Distance is encreas'd Between my abject Fortune and my Love, How far beneath your Smiles, beneath your Scorn, Then to be calm, then to remain unmov'd, Term it not Patience, but the want of Love. Alm. Rouse then Ambition, quit this hapless Choice; A fairer Love invites thee to her Arms, And with an Empire will reward thy Flame. A Train of smiling Hours invites thy Heart, And thou shalt sleep in Peace and wake to Joy. Bel. Be witness Heav'n! if I unmanly griev'd, If one mean Thought found ent'rance in my Heart. Valeria I refuse, if Modesty Allows such Speech; Justinian disobey, And gladly honest Poverty embrace. Why name I these as Proofs of faithful Love? My faithful Love rejoices at such Proofs, Ambitious to be farther try'd.âCome then Afflictions come! from out Pandora's Box Pour all your Plagues on this devoted Head! Ye reach not my impenetrable Heart; Full of Almira, there ye find no Place, Almira's Image bars all Ent'rance there. Alm. To what sad Choice am I compell'd by Fate! He is undone shou'd he resist my Prayers, Shou'd I prevail, Almira! thou art lost. [Aside. Consider well thy State; yet be advis'd; Let Reason sway, and let a Friend prevail. Bel. Urge me no more, unless it be to die. Alm. Yet I must urge, yet dread to overcome. [Aside. Art thou resolv'd? let Empire, Glory, Pow'râ Bel. Vain, vain Temptations when compar'd with Love. Alm. Is Love so priz'd? take then thy just Reward; Poor Recompence, yet all Almira has. The Heart, which fled thee happy, wealthy, great, To thee disgrac'd, abandon'd, friendless, yields. Bel. Oh sweetest Excellence! transporting Bliss! Oh matchless Fair! inimitably good! Wonder of Truth, Pattern of gen'rous Love! Hence, the Remembrance of my injur'd Fame, Of Foes triumphant, or of Friends ingrate! To dark Oblivion all my Cares I drive. Alm. United Hearts, united be our Cares, And be as fam'd for Misery as Love. Bel. Glorious Resolve! of my first Blessing sure, For thy lov'd sake, Justinian I will sue; At least he will afford a calm Retreat. There wrapt in Love we will forget the World, Secure in Innocence I need not fear, Nor can his Justice bar me such Delight. The sacred Oak endures the Winter's Rage, Deep are his Roots, nor yet impair'd with Age. The Storms contemns, resists the angry Skies, And on his honest, conscious Strength relies. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. The Scene continues. Enter Justinian and Hermogenes. Just. Impious Design! Her. Detestable and base! Just. False Belisarius, to thy Fame and me. Her. When false to you, he justly forfeits Fame. Just. Can Man be capable of such Deceit. Her. It much amazes me. All Men abhor To be deceiv'd, yet daily they deceive. My Fault is to be open, too sincere, My Love and Hatred known: If I can hate, If I have Enmity, it is to Vice. Just. I know thee honest, him too I believ'd. Her. If I am held in Doubt, prepare the Rack, Extend each Nerve, and burst each swelling Vein. Produce the Bull, the Vulture, and the Wheel, And try my Faith, my Constancy in Truth. Just. I doubt thee not. Yet Belisarius false, Raises Suspicion of the Race of Manâ So trusted! so belov'd! with him I shar'd The Sweets of Empire, all the Cares my own: To him resign'd the Reins of Government; Gave him the Pow'r to punish or reward. And is he false? And can his Looks betray? And can his Breast conceive Ingratitude? Her. Incredible indeed! I should dispise Less Proofs; but Vitigies, the noble Goth, Charm'd by your Goodness, by your Virtue aw'd, Removes the Veil, and shews the Plot too bare. 'Tis obvious to the Sense, beyond all doubt. Just. The feign'd Displeasure shewn to gratify Valeria, with the Day shou'd have expir'd. The Cloud remov'd, he shou'd have risen next Day Fresh as the Morn, and as the Sun resplendant. Her. And it were fit he shou'd. Or cou'd the Goth Invent this Tale, impossible to think, Why? To what End? Yet if we cou'd suspect, Macro, I grieve to say, confirms the whole. Just. Valeria shou'd have been appeas'd; his Truth, His Constancy in Love, I secret, prais'd, Tho' un-allied I mark'd him for my Heir. Her. Ambition has no Bounds, a vulgar Truth. 'Tis tedious to attend; he aims more near, Scorns a dependant and incertain State. Just. What Pity 'tis, how I lament his Crime! Her. Tho' Macro, by Confession, merits Grace, He only did not join in the Design. The Root strikes deep, the Branches are spread wide. My Brother caught! when he has dar'd so far, Who then has Virtue to escape his Snares? The dire Contagion has infected all. Just. Mercy would rise, thy Justice bears it down. And much I owe thy Diligence and Love. Instruct what's to be done with this Ingrate. Her. A smiling Traytor, how I hate such Men, So black a Crime, no Penalty too great. Just. I well remember, when but young in Arms, He vanquish'd Perozas, a Persian Chief; Pleas'd with the News, I swore, rashly it seems, He shou'd not die thro' me, what e'er his Fault. My Oath observ'd, what other Punishment Thy loyal Vengeance can invent, inflict. Her. Mercy by halves! unsound such Politics; A thankless Boon; or punish or forgive. Weigh well his fam'd Ability in War, His graceful Figure, and majestick Mien; His great Alliances, and noble Birth; Profuse in Gifts, compassionate to all, Firm to his Friend, beneficent to Foes, Serene his Mind, magnificent in Life; The Populace, the Soldier, all adore, In him the World will grieve. And shall he live? Disgrac'd and live? His Soul disdains such Life: Or if preserv'd, 'tis to hatch new Designs, To call his Friends, those Virtues to his Aid, Subvert the State, and give the World a Lord. Just. Thou shew'st his Virtues in so strong a Light, It staggers and rebates the Edge of Justice. He must not die: Is there no other way? Her. Happy the People under such a Prince! Happy am I, to serve whom Mercy sways! A heav'nly Virtue!âsafest in their Hands, 'Tis Wisdom there, but Folly oft in Manâ You cannot errâThere is but one way leftâ My tender Nature startles at the Deed. Just. Name it. Her. An enterprising Soul, nor can He wander long with Eyes to see his Road. Just. Hah! Her. Severe, yet practis'd in the wiser East. Nor Prisons, Dungeons, Fetters are secure, The Ladder oft to reach a higher Rank. Just. See where he comes. Can Treason be so lodg'd? The Mansion is too noble for the Guest. Her. Serpents and Toads lurk under sweetest Herbs. To give him Audience is not safe. You know He has a smooth, insinuating Tongue. Enter Belisarius and Proclus. Bel. I come not to complain of my hard Fate, Nor grate your Ears with Services perform'd. Such Conduct might be term'd an Insolence, And steel your Breast against my last Request. Just. And what Request do'st thou presume to make? Bel. Nor Pow'r nor Wealth I supplicate. My Mind Is satiated, and I renounce such Toys. A Villa stands on Tyber's fertile Banks, This Morning mine. When CÃ¦sar's Wars allow'd The Sword unactive, then my lov'd Retreat; There let me indolent consume my Days, And with Almira bid the World adieu. Her. Observe the Place to which he wou'd retire, And with Almira too, ador'd in Rome. How ev'ry Circumstance confirms his Guilt! [To Just. aside. Just. There needs no farther Proofs.âSoft Hypocrite! With Meekness thou dost hide ambitious Thoughts, And veil thy Stratagems with Shew of Love. Bel. Were I ambitious, or base Hypocrite, I had escap'd the Terror of your Wrath. Just. Traytor no more. Thy Plots stand all reveal'd; I view thy Rebel Heart with Treason stor'd, And Vengeance hovers o'er thy guilty Head. Wait my Command, while I decree thy Crimes Due Punishment.âHermogenes attend. [Ex. Just. and Her. Bel. What Punishment can equal such harsh Terms! But late, all Tongues employ'd to sound my Fame, All Eyes with Wonder gaz'd, Kings in my Train, By Beauty courted, Empire in my Choiceâ And now a Traytor, Hypocrite, Ingrate. Opprobrious Words! most infamous to hear! Horror invades me at the Sound, my Heart With Indignation swells, and with Disdain Leaps to my Throat and cuts off idle Speech. Pro. From thee, Hermogenes, these Mischiefs spring; Thou art the Soil in which all poys'nous Plants Luxuriant grow, and nourish'd by thy Art Bear such pernicious, pestilential Fruit. Bel. Proclus! my Friend! for yet a Friend is left, Partner in War, my Counsellor in Peace, My Confident in Love, ever my Friend! To thee my inmost Thoughts were all disclos'd: Have I deserv'd Indignity like this? Am I that Thing which Scorn forbids repeat? Pro. It tears, it racks, distracts my Soul to hear. Bel. Nor loss of Pow'r, nor pinching Want, nor Death The smaller Ill, from it's firm Basis moves My stable Mind. I can acquit me to myself, And therefore give myself that Peace, the World Ingratefully denies. I can look back On what I was, I see what now I am, And view with equal Eyes my diverse State. Yet when Experience shews, yet when I know What Calumny attends a great Man's Fall, How loud she bellows, and how wide she gapes To blacken and traduce. What idle Tales, What incoherent Lies, Time may transmit As Truths, to mangle and deface my Fame: Then Fortitude forsakes me, then my Griefs Want thy Support, and call on thee for Aid. Pro. Justinian cannot sure persist in Wrongâ Bel. Suddain and violent are his Resolves. I give myself as lostâHaste then my Friend, Fly to Almira, bear her my Request, Perhaps my last Request; entreat the Fair To ease my Sorrows with one parting Look; Let me but gaze on her, I shall die pleas'd.â But haste or I shall never see her more. [Exit Proclus. Never to see Almira more! hard Fate! But rav'nous Death, that snatches me from Love, Removes the Pains, the Mem'ry of such Loss. Then welcome Death.âI shall not wait thee long; He comes, he flies, his Messenger appears. Enter Hermogenes with Guards. I need not ask, I read my Fate in thee, And thy glad Eyes declare I am to die. Her. Most sure such Crimes, such Treason merit Death. Bel. Treasons and Crimes! who dare impeach my Truth? Her. Go reason that with CÃ¦sar, He best knows. The Proofs are plain, demonstrative. Howe'er His Mercy o'er his Justice has prevail'd, And thou art suffer'd still to crawl on Earth. Bel. Thy abject Soul illiterate in Good, And ignorant of Joy, but when the brave, The virtuous and the honest Man is griev'd; Thy gloomy Mind could not appear thus gay, Were there less Punishment decreed than Death. Her. The Love of Life prevails on any Terms; If these are harsh, 'tis in thy Pow'r to die, And by one generous Blow dismiss all Cares. A noble Deed! but I give no Advice. Bel. None but what Hell suggests to thy dark Soul. Had I a Wish for Life, it were to see Remorse and Anguish gnaw thy flinty Heart; Earnest of Hell. Her. That thou shalt never see. Bel. What obstinate, determinate in Ill! Her. Resolv'd to rob thee of that pleasing Sight. Guards! seize your Prisoner, lead him henceâaway And execute the Emperor's Commands. Bel. Tho' in the Jaws of Death, tho' in thy Pow'r, The bitt'rest Curse! my Mind sedate and calm, Impervious by Ill, thy Wonder shall excite, And be the Object of thy Envy still, And give thee fiercer Pains than I endure. Fortune and thou in vain assault that Breast, Where Courage and where Innocence reside. [Belisarius is led off. Enter Vitiges. Vit. I come to claim thy Promise; my Reward I seek; make Payment quick, my vast Reward For Treachery, for Perjury, for Hell. Her. To Empire turn thy Thought; Success is sure. Vit. Mark me for damn'd Ingratitude. Each Sin Suffices to impel the reddest Bolt From the just Wrath of Heav'n. Her. Why let it fall. Be resolute; we shall escape the Blow. Vit. Statesman, thou art inur'd to Infamy: Practice hath petrify'd thy wicked Heart; Bred to Conspiracies, to fawn, betray, To lie: Yet thou can'st smile! yet thou can'st sleep! Never shall Joy more sparkle in my Eyes, No chearful Smile adorn my gloomy Face, No Darkness veil the Images by Day Impress'd, ghastly and fierce. No Drug, no Herb, Intice sweet Sleep to silence yelling Care. Her. You are too nice, too delicate of Mind; Wou'd you be Great, and scruple you the Means? Vit. I tell thee, Politician, that the Wounds Of Conscience, by Repentance must be heal'd. Seduc'd by thy Inchantments, I have done A Deed, beneath the Dignity of Kings, Beneath the Dignity of Man. Base Man! The only Species capable to lie. Almira weeps for Innocence traduc'd, And mourns that Belisarius is displac'd; Happy! she knows not of her Father's Crime. Almira's Tears have wash'd away thy Charm, And I behold myself with Shame and Scorn. Her. Was it not Belisarius who subdu'd The Goths? Their Name extinguish'd by his Sword? The poor Remains sold Slaves? Is Vitiges A Captive, and in scornful Triumph led To feed his Pride and please the hissing Crow'd? And are you grown so abject, not to seek Revenge, the strongest Passion of the Mind? Vit. Not by unworthy Means, by thy vile Arts. Her. You urge my Temper, Sir, too far. Desist, Or CÃ¦sar shall be told, nay we will prove, If Belisarius is unjustly tax'd, You were the Plotter, you contriv'd the Scheme. Vit. Impute thy Crimes to me! can it be thoughtâ Her. Already perjur'd, you must needs find Faith. Vit. What Insolence! Her. Macro shall justify What I affirm. You have impos'd on me, And drew my easy Nature to believe. Vit. Unheard of Villany! What to my Face! Her. Come we have gone too far, now to recede. Be calm; I only shew what might be done, Far from my honest Thoughts. Be rul'd by me, And on to Morrow be saluted King. But now retireâYou must not be seen here. Vit. Resistless Bait! tho' infamous the Means, We blindly follow or are weakly led, So strong the Appetites to rule. When will To Morrow come!âCou'd I forget this Day!â Oh joyful Day! tho' I no more a King. [Exit Vitiges. Her. What Terrors has he rais'd! the Precipice Lay full to sight, tott'ring I stood, nigh fall'n. He must not liveâI stand on unsure Ground, Obvious the yawning pitchy Gulphâmy Brain Yet dizzy.âLet me fairer Prospects viewâ Turn thy pleas'd Eyes, on other's Ruin feast, And sate thy Soul with dire Revenge.â'Tis done! How soon perform'd th'irreparable Deed! Hah! Ghastly Sight!âIt shocks, it terrifies.â Proceed thy Joys from thence? Is that thy Feast? He gropes his Wayâdistain'd, besmear'd with Blood. I cannot bear th'Approachâ'tis Deathâ'tis Hell, 'Tis all I dreadâ'tis less than I deserveâ I shun the SightâOh cou'd I shun my self! [Exit Hermogenes. Enter Belisarius blind. Bel. Behold, good Heaven! behold my wretched State! And on triumphant Villany look down! I call not on Revenge; ever awake Thy Justice is, and best knows when to strike. Equally great, thy Mercy I implore T'endue my Mind with Light, my Eyes have lost, To know thy Wisdom, and revere thy Pow'r! Where am I now? Or whither tend my Steps?â No matter where; bold and secure he treads, Who dares, who wishes to encounter Death. No more the vernal Beauties of the Fields, No more the budding Honors of the Woods Shall chear my Sight; all Lustre lost to me Obscure and dark; and all is Chaos now. Alas! more piercing Ills deface such Loss. Almira! never shall thy beauteous Form Find chearful Ent'rance in these hollow Orbs. Unutterable Woe! Prone on the Earth Extend this Mass of Griefâthere dig thy Grave, Thy only Mansion now.âAlmira, oh! Enter Almira. Alm. When Belisarius calls, Almira hastes, With Ardor flies to the inchanting Voice.â Stretched on the Ground! Kind Heav'n avert my Fears! Are you alive? Oh! Whence this shew of Grief? Hear Belisarius when Almira calls! [Going to Him. Bel. Too sure I live, not yet my Sorrows end. Alm. Alive! and speak! yet turn thy Eyes away! Bel. Alas! I never can behold thee more. Alm. Not see me more! 'Tis thy Almira speaks. Bel. Thy Voice will ever charm, thy Sight no more. Alm. Has then the Weight of Malice sunk thee down? And is thy noble Heart a Prey to Care? No, 'tis Valeria who has wrought this Change, Her Charms forbid to view this slighted Face, And wild Ambition has engross'd thy Heart. Bel. Wrong not my Honour, nor traduce my Love. Alm. Yes, I am made the Sacrifice of Peace, My useless Love, my feeble Charms contemn'd. My Father's Kingdom conquer'd by thy Arms, He and his Daughter in proud Triumph led, These Wrongs o'ercome, I fondly gave my Heart To thee disgrac'd, abandon'd by thy Friends; Doubly thy Captive, now I am despis'd. But thy feign'd Grief, thy conscious Shame in vain Palliate the Wrong.âResentment drives me hence, Nor will I stay the Witness of thy Guilt. [She goes to some Distance. Bel. Oh stay! and view the Cause of my Despair! But first prepare, arm well thy tender Mind, Nor let the dismal Spectacle amaze. Alm. Ah! [Turning to her, she faints. Bel. Well I foresaw, the Horror of the Sight Wou'd startle thee. 'Twas therefore I deferr'd. Now, my Almira! now behold my Woe! Have I not Cause? In vain the visual Nerves Are stretched to bring thy Image to my Brain; Lost to my Eyes, fix'd in my Heart.âNot speakâ Not answer meâHas Horror driv'n thee hence?â And art thou fled?âForsaken too by thee! Merciless Death! Do'st thou avoid me too? Proclus! Almira! Death! Heav'n!âAll, all deaf! Enter Proclus. Pro. Sure 'twas his Voice! Almira on the Earth! [As he advances towards her, he sees Belisarius. What Belisarius too! What can this mean? Both claim my AidâFriendship be first obey'd. My noble Friend! Bel. Go seek Almira out. Useless thy Care of me.âGo search my Love; Bring, bring her here. Pro. Behold! Turn there thy Eyes. Bel. Mock not my GriefsâProclus! View thou thy Friend. Pro. Oh Horror! Horror! Bel. Hush thy vain Complaints! Pro. Oh damn'd, detested Deed! Bel. Where is my Love? Pro. Oh miserable Sight! Villains! Hell! Hell! Torn out thy Eyes! Bel. Away, Almira seekâ Pro. Transported by her Grief, she fainting liesâ Bel. Quick, quick, my Friend, lead guide me to the Fairâ [Rising. Be thou my SightâLet me have one Embrace, And prostrate at her Feet, forget my Wrongs. 'Tis my Almira! 'Tis my tender Love! I need not Eyes to know, my Heart directs. Pro. She breaths, she stirs. Bel. Gently the Angel raise. Oh give her to my Arms! Recline on me Thou Heav'nly Recompence of mortal Cares! Pro. Rage shakes this Frame, and Grief dissolves my Heart. Hurry'd by Rage, due Vengeance I wou'd claim. Nor Kings shou'd bar, nor Altars shou'd protect. Enervated by Grief, I bend to Earth, Nor can remove me from the woeful Sight. Oh Sight! infusing Horror and Despair! Oh Niobe! Thy eligible Doom! Better a Stone than reasoning wretched Man. Bel. Awake my Love? Oh, bless me with thy Voice! Alm. Oh leave me in this soft forgetful State! Bel. Bless'd be the Sound! Live, my Almira live! And on less frightful Objects turn thy Eyes. Alm. Where shall I turn my streaming Eyes? The World Affords no other Object worthy Sight.â Oh woeful Sight! that blasts my vernal Hopes, Freezes my Blood, and withers all my Joys. Bel. Approach ye Envious, ye Detractors come! Ye who malign'd my Pow'r, my Fame in Arms, These mournful Accents hear! Almira view! And see me Triumph in her piteous Tears! Now swell with Rage, behold a richer Prize, A nobler Conquest than my Sword e're won! Alm. Thy Loss, thy Pains inflame my grateful Breast, And I grow more enamour'd by thy Wrongs. I am the wretched Cause of this curs'd Deed; Shall I refrain from gazing then on thee? On thee, the Object still of my Desires.â No, be their Malice scorn'd, their Pow'r defy'd, Nor shall their Pow'r deter, nor Modesty Dissuade my flying to thy Arms for Peace, for Joy. Bel. My Life! my Soul! all that is dear on Earth! So wholly are my Thoughts on thee employ'd, Feeling so quickn'd by the Loss of Sight, So strong thy lov'd Idea on my Mind Impress'd, methinks I gaze upon thee still: Still view the Lillies on thy Face and Breasts, The blushing Roses on thy Lips and Checks, And I but close my Sight, as when beheld The dazling Rays shot from thy heav'nly Eyes, And still my Soul with former Joys is fill'd. Alm. Yet it is sad; is it not gracious Heav'n? Oh ease his Pains!âAnd is there no Redress?â Oh I wou'd lend one Light! oh both bestow! Bel. I can forget my Pains, neglect my Eyesâ What's Pain or Loss of Eyes to this Embrace? Pro. Send from thy three Divisions, send, thou Globe, Innumerable Hosts to mourn his Wrongs! Yawn wide thou Earth! ye Fiends come dancing forth, And see your selves outdone by mortal Spite! A while forget your Torments, and rejoice That Virtue suffers, and that Vice prevails. Alm. Oh! you indulgent Pow'rs! whence Mercy flows, Oh grant us Patience to support these Woes! Pro. Is it a Virtue to be patient now, When Virtue is thus impiously oppress'd? Patience and Caution are the false Pretence Of Slaves and Cowards to submit to Wrongs. Revenge, Revenge alone is worth my Care. Dire Goddess come! and with thy hundred Whips Aid my Pursuit, and lash the Slave to Hell, The base detested Author of these Wrongs. Bel. Complaints are vain, and keep our Griefs awake. Leave to unerring Heav'n to punish Crimes. But guide me, oh ye faithful virtuous Pair! Conduct my feeble Steps, from hence remove, From Courts, from Crowds, to Friendship and to Love. This Comfort still remains, to charm my Mind, One Friend is faithful, and Almira kind. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. The Scene continues. Enter Hermogenes and Macro. Mac. I met him at the Gate, by Proclus led, Led by Almira; tis a dismal Sight. Her. Oh never, never will it fly my Mind. Spectres nor Fiends could terrify so much. Mac. Was there no other Way? best to have dy'd. Her. I cou'd not win the Emperor's Consent, Cruel his Mercies are. He bound himself, He said by Vows, by Oaths; trifling Pretence! Mac. Shou'd CÃ¦sar see, his Anger must abate. Her. Macro, 'tis true; consult our Safety we. Suspend these Thoughts a while; leave to lament, And let yet greater Crimes this Crime defend. Repentance and Compassion will arise In Cesar's wavering Breast, unless he views Some fresh Conspiracy design'd. Beside, Valeria may be justly fear'd; her Love Again surmounts her Wrath. The Rabble too This Morn enroll'd him with the Gods: At Noon with Taunts and Hisses they pursu'd his Steps; And e'er 'tis Night, in their tumultuous Rage With equal Justice they will sacrifice His Foes, and him will deify again. Mac. What e'er we do, we soon must execute. Her. Nor are we safe, shou'd Vitiges survive; Already he repents, and wildly talks Of wounded Conscience, and of injur'd Fame. He must be soon dispatch'd. Mac. What's to be done? The Rabble are enrag'd, and bellow loud; Their Nests disturb'd, the Hornets swarm abroad, And buz and rage t'infix their deadly Stings. Her. Mix with our Friends among the sordid Crowd; There loudly Belisarius praise, extol His Fame, and dwell pathetic on his Wrongs. Let Justice be their Cry, they love the Sound. Then head our mercinary Troop; and Death Secure thou may'st inflict on those we dread, When Friends and Foes confus'dly intermix. Pretending Aid to CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sar's Friends Destroy.âBe gone, for see Valeria comes. [Exit. Macro. Enter Valeria. Val. Where is this Traytor? This inhuman Wretch? And art thou found? And dar'st thou stand my Rage? Her. Have I offended? Witness gracious Heaven!â Val. Do'st thou appeal to Heav'n? Impiety! 'Tis Blasphemy in thy apostate Mouth But to pronounce that sacred Name. Invoke Thy Hell, thy black Original, from whence Such Cruelty, such Malice cou'd proceed. Her. What have I done? Val. The insolent Demand! On Belisarius think, think on his Wrongs; Then ask thy self, then dare to think of Heav'n. Thy Malice has involv'd me in thy Guilt, Made me participate thy horrid Crimes. Could'st thou believe? Oh Providence how just! The Wicked of their Prudence to divest, And Folly give for Guide, when impiously They deviate from thy Laws. Could'st thou suppose If I had Interest, if I had Pow'r To work the Emperor, by a Sister's Pray'rs, To counterfeit Displeasure, and displace The justest, bravest, worthiest of Mankind; Could'st thou, the basest, falsest, be so vain To hope Escape? Or say I slept, or were Too weak to punish, is not Heav'n awake? Her. Their faithful Servants Princes thus reward; The Tax we pay for delegated Pow'r. If with sinister Look Fortune regards Our Toil, the Shame and the Disgrace is ours, Tho' Wisdom did direct. If they succeed Thro' us, the Profit and the Honour theirs. Val. No, Monster, no. Such Ministers as thou Never give Council but to selfish Ends. Ambition, Avarice, Envy, and Revenge Engross your Thoughts; and never are pursu'd Your Prince's Honour, or your Country's Good. By low Submission, and by servile Arts Ye mount the Battlements of Pow'r; and strait The Scaffold undermine by which ye rose. By base Degrees ascend; the topmost Round Obtain'd, the Prince with Envy ye behold, Trace out unpopular, offensive Rules, Then meanly quit, his sinking Cause desert, And to the next Invader pay your Vows. Her. Such Music ever dwells upon your Tongue, Th'Attention charm'd, I cou'd with Pleasure hear Th'harmonious Sound, shou'd you pronounce my Death. Val. Low Flatterer! ill-judging Sycophant! Is this a Time to sooth by fulsom Praise? Her. Am I to blame? 'Twas CÃ¦sar gave Command. When Discontents prevail, the Minister Is safely tax'd, but Pow'r supreme is meant. 'Twas CÃ¦sar's Will, the Empire's Safety urg'd.â Val. CÃ¦sar shall knowâand opportune he comes, To hear thee shuffle off thy Sins on him. Enter Justinian. Approach, misguided Prince! behold the Slave Who first seduc'd me, credulous and fond To wrong the best of Men, a Moment's Wrong! Whose impious Council hath procur'd a Deed Cruel and rash, pernicious to thy Fame, And ever to thy Justice a Reproach. And now he dares plead Innocence, and now Thy Rashness, my Credulity is blam'd. Just. I know the Cause, and I approve of Grief So just; 'twas too severe; wou'd it cou'd be Recall'd. I feel with him, I mourn with thee. Val. Ease then thy Mind, expiate in part thy Guilt. Let his devoted Head attone for Crimes, Which his inveterate Malice cou'd invent. Just. And yet I was unwillingly induced, Sigh'd for his Guilt, and mourn'd his dark Designs. Val. His Guilt, and his Designs! Just. Too evident. Unworthy were my Hands to hold the Scales Of dread impartial Justice, were the Weights Unequal, or his Merits not allow'd Their full Extent. My Peace, that I forgive, The Empire's Safety claim'd this Sacrifice. Her. Necessity compell'd. Val. Traytor be dumb. Your Peace, the Safety of the Empire urg'd! Of Belisarius do you speak? Just. Of him. And wou'd to Heav'n I cou'd retrieve his Guilt And Punishment, with half my Loss of Empire! So much he was esteem'd, so well belov'd. Flagrant the Proofs, else I were most accurs'd. He had conspir'd against my Dignity, Seduc'd the Army to espouse his Cause; And, aided by the Goths, he would reject My Pow'r, and a new Empire raise in Rome. Macro, repenting Macro, has confess'd. Val. Is that a Proof? Oh Imposition gross, Absur'd! forgive me Sir! you bad me love And must allow my Rage. Are you to learn, Dull Macro is his wicked Instrument, [Pointing to Hermogenes. The Tool, the Eccho, of this Hypocrite? Just. When you have heard, then Censure will be mute. To Belisarius Sword much Praise is due, But Wisdom is more prevalent than Arms. Had not this faithful Servant interven'd With wise Advice, Conquests were vain to me. Two Witnesses our Law demands; and two Appear'd, in ev'ry Circumstance agreed. Macro confess'd, and Vitiges confirm'd. Val. Credit his Foe! 'tis Malice, 'tis Revenge. Just. Behold he comes, now be your self the Judge. Enter Vitiges, leaning on his Sword. How's this? Wounded he seems, and weakly moves. Her. Confusion! yet alive! Macro has fail'd, He kills by halves, but I shall perish whole. Vit. Flow not so fast my Blood! breathe yet ye Lungs! Lend Strength good Heaven! support my feeble Limbs! Prolong my Life! till I reveal my Shame. Just. I grieve to see your Wounds; from whence this Chance? Vit. No Chance; from Macro's Hands these Wounds proceed, To stifle Truth; least Honour not extinct Shou'd prompt me to disclose our Treachery, Our Falshood by Hermogenes contriv'd. Just. Your Accusation false! Vit. False, groundless, base. Just. Oh ye just Pow'rs! what has my Rashness done? Vit. What has Ambition done? Flatter'd, betray'd? Val. Oh Belisarius! well I knew thy Worth. Vit. Oh name him not, his Innocence, like Heav'n, Glares on my Sins, and, with distracted Sight, I view the Hell I merit e'er I dieâ I view it thereâ'tis painted in that Faceâ It is it's Monarchâlet us speed him thereâ Thus Devil to thy own Dominion haste.â [Vitiges offers to run at Hermogenes, and falls. Let him not escape.âWitness I repentâ And BelisariusâDaughterâoh forgive. [Dies. Just. And art thou yet alive? Detested Slave! Infernal Dog! can'st thou support the Light? Her. Your Anger is more terrible than Death. Zeal to engross your Love inspir'd those Crimes, And if Contrition for those Crimes might hopeâ Just. Presumptuous Villain! what! and darest thou hope? Despair and die. If Mercy thou would'st seek, Let Belisarius start before thy Eyes And cut off Utterance.âI heard the Wretch Artfully turn his Virtues into Crimes, Yet I was to those Virtues deaf. The Bull Thou did'st invoke, the Vulture and the Wheel; Oh I cou'd curse my self, not to suspect Unnecessary Vows of Innocence; Be they thy endless Lot!âMonster, be gone, Precipitate to Hell, Region of Woe! Guards! seize the Slave.âTake, drag him hence to Death. [Hermogenes is carry'd off. Val. That the foul Rust of Scandal is remov'd, That Innocence appears in bright Array Is some Alloy to Grief. Let us rejoice That Belisarius yet survives, tho' blind. Employ your Thoughts to recompence his Wrongs, And sweeten Life with Joys he yet can taste. I yield not to Despair, since yet he lives. Enter Proclus. Just. Grant him to live, good Heav'n! prolong his Days! That he may find how truly I repent. Proclus! most welcome! to my Wish arriv'd, To witness how I mourn thy injur'd Friend. Pro. Injur'd indeed! dead Macro hath confess'd The black Conspiracy. Just. Is he then dead? Pro. This Sword extorted Truth before he dy'd. That curs'd Hermogenes contriv'd the Plot By which my Friend is lost. And on pretence That Belisarius' Wrongs might be redress'd, Macro intic'd the Populace to rise. All were amaz'd, confus'd. He lead a Band Of Ruffians, proper Instruments of Death, With popular and feign'd Acclame, he cry'd, Let CÃ¦sar live! down with his Foesâand thenâ Oh Grief to tell! Just. This Vitiges declar'd. See where he lies, cut off by Macro's Sword. Pro. Happy! he is exempt from farther Cares. The chaste Almira's Wounds not move thee now. Just. Her Wounds! Pro. Eager and covetous of Death, Among the heedless Swords she ran, she flew, Distracted at the Sight, oh horrid Sight! Just. More Woe! Pro. Macro pretending to suppress The Rage his Arts contriv'd, while on my Arm Great Belisarius lean'dâthe Traytor's Swordâ Oh that I live to tellâmy Friend! my Friend! Thy Bosom pierc'd. Val. Oh that I live to hear! Oh that thy Fate, Almira! had been mine! Wou'd I had dy'd like thee, oh envy'd Maid! Envy'd in Life, and envy'd more in Death! Just. Sorrow and Shame and Guilt tie up my Tongue. Val. Love wounds more deep, Love more distracts than these. Neglected Love enrag'd my haughty Soul. Presumptuous, I defy'd a greater Curse. Who knows the worst? Oh who can tell how deep The Wrath of Heav'n can pierce, how far afflict? Thee, Hero, thee! whose Suff'rings who can tell? Thee I wou'd now resign, and think me bless'd On any Terms to rescue thee from Death. Pro. Revenge, Confusion, Horror, and Despair Seiz'd ev'ry Heart, appear'd in ev'ry Face. He only unconcern'd. Proclus! he cry'd, 'Tis done, my Sorrows cease, here end my Cares. While Life remains, see me with Speed convey'd To CÃ¦sar, to attest my Innocence, My Honour this demands. He could no more; For now he learn'd Almira's Fate. Then, then His Courage fail'd, Proof to all other Ills. Oh dismal Deed! Oh Spectacle of Woe! The noble virtu'ous Pair, welt'ring in Blood! Oh dismal Accents! Oh ye gen'rous Breasts! Each mourn'd the other's lamentable Fate, Each in their own rejoyc'd. Forgive my Tears! I cannot, need not speak.âBehold them brought! Val. Horror to Sight! oh Torture to my Mind! Worse, worse than Death! I live and see Thee dieâand folded in another's Arms. Now Jealousy returns, jealous in Death. What num'rous Griefs distract my crowded Brain! Fly the sad Sight!âOh can I fly my Thoughts! The racking Thought, that I began thy Woes.â But fly the SightâGo waste thy tedious Life In gloomy Grottos and in dreary Cells. Incessant there, thy Guilt his Fate deplore, Nor Man, nor Sun, shall ever view thee more. [Exit Valeria. Belisarius and Almira are led in supported, and leaning on each other, then placed in Chairs. Alm. My Strength declines apace. I sink, I faint. Bel. Oh stay! Almira! leave me not behind. Just. Oh Belisarius! cou'd I tell my Grief, Cou'd I display the Anguish of my Soul, Thy Mercy wou'd look gently on my Faults, And Pity wou'd inspire thee to forgive. Bel. Then I die pleas'd, no more remains to ask, My Loyalty, my Honour, justify'd. Just. Nor Day, nor Hour shall pass, wherein thy Praise Shall not be lowdly sung, my Rashness mourn'd. Bel. May you live happy! I shall soon find Peace. But where's my Love?âAlmira! yet alive! Oh guide my wand'ring feeble Arms to Heav'n! Yet art thou warm my Fair? yet beats thy Heart? Alm. To thee it beats and flutters at thy Touch. On thee depends its Strength, by thee I breathe. Insensible of Pain, thoughtless of Death, When I can clasp, when I can press thee here, When I can hang my drooping Head on thee. But now I faint, for thou alas! grow'st cold. Bel. Life on the Wing, thy Voice delays her Flight. For her immortal Voyage prun'd, thou call'st My Soul to Earth. Nor is my Heav'n delay'd, When with Almira joyn'd; I have it here, And in thy Arms anticipate my Joys. Pro. I have no Friendship, I am form'd of Steel, Or Grief and Pity wou'd dissolve this Heart. Alm. Or do my Eyes deceive me? grow they dim? Or am I wild and fanciful in Death? Instruct me some; view I my Father there? Pro. Too true, by the same Villany destroy'd. Alm. The little that remain'd of Life, that Sight Exhausts.âI dy'd to slowâFather!âI come. Death has less Terror nowâ'tis sweetâ'tis kind.â Oh Belisarius hasteâOh gracious Heav'nâ [Dies. Bel. Peace to thy Soul!âObservant of thy Callâ I follow theeâto Heav'nâOh may I findâ [Dies. Pro. He's gone, he's gone; Virtue is fled the World. Just. Thou best of Men farewel! Proclus, to thee My Sorrow shall be seen, constant, sincere, Till in thy lost Friend's Name thou shal't forgive. Succeed him in Command and in my Love, Small Recompence, well weigh'd, for such a Loss. And let my Rashness like a Beacon blaze To warn all others from the fatal Shelve. Henceforth let none invidious Tales regard, And never censure, nor condemn unheard. [Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
