      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Argilo, Gonsalvo, Dorando, Balthazar, Surgeon, (who binds up Balthazar's Wound.) Argilo. Bring Lights More Lights! And set a guard upon The Gates: Be sure none enter here, but those Who are ally'd to us? Gonsalvo. Send unto th'Governor; Entreat him that His Officers take care the people be Disperc'd that throng about the house, though some Are so ill natur'd, that they take the pains Of hast'ning hither to see mischief, yet Others are worse natur'd, and come to do it. Dorando. Vice, Famine, and mistaken Zeal consume 'em? How their wise courages affect to gape On danger, when themselves stand safe? Brave Sir, How do you feel your wound? Balthazar. I am oblieg'd unto your valor Sir, Which doth no less deserve my wonder, then Your courtesie my praise; for I admire A stranger should ingage his youth, and life To so much hazard, where he neither knew The persons, nor the cause. Doran. I saw you were Distress'd with numbers Sir, I could not think My honor well dispos'd, till it was throughly Inclin'd to make you safe. Your wound (I hope) Gives you no sence of inward sickness? Bal. A meer scratch? My servants over-diligence, and this Tame posture in a Chair, are ways to make It seem much greater then it is. Argilo. Cosin, I pray sit still! Although your wound be slight, Your motion may unbind it; and I know No blood belonging to our family, but is too good to lose Enter Claramante. Gonsa. Look there, your sister Claramante, Sir, Is hurried hither by her loving fears. Clar. My Brother Balthazar! How have my vows miscarry'd thus of late? Or are my sins more powerful then my pray'rs, That all my importunities to Heaven Are lost. I've oftner beg'd your safety, then Mine own. Balt. Dear Claramante, were I dead, Men that stood by and saw those tears would chide You for too great expence of grief, knowing Your health and beauty most concern the World. I feel a greater danger from Your sorrow, then my wound. Trust me, I am well. Clar. Our City fam'd for Government, is by These nightly Riots and Disorders, grown Less safe then Galleys, where revolted Slaves Inchain their Officers. Balt. This sister is th'unruly season, when Young raging Lovers meet their Rivals in The dark; but I as little know mine enemy, As guess the cause of his malicious wrath. That noble stranger doth deserve your thanks And praise, if I can serve you with my life, For 'tis his valor hath continued it. Clar. Sir, there were little hope that I should pay So large a debt, should I not ask his name, To whose great vertue I do ow it. Dor. Madam, I am call'd Dorando; but it Is far from my ambition, to believe That any act of mine can add such worth Unto my name, that you should think it fit To wear't one hour within your memory. Clar. Sir, your humility is too unkind: You undervalue whom you have preserv'd, And me, when you suspect I shall forget His name that sav'd my Brothers life. Dor. O love! Thou busie Deity? How could It need, thou shouldst o'ercome me with her voice When I was conquer'd by her eyes before. Enter Leonte. Leon. Brother! What are you for the Grave to night? Must we shake hands, and never meet again, Unless Philosophers agree upon another World. Balt. No Sir? I've resolv'd better on't? We'll Stay here till they have ended their dispute. Leon. Content? I have examin'd This incounter, and I find the night Bred a mistake; certain furious lovers Most bounteously design'd to serenade My sister at her Window, Met with their rivals here. In their blind rage Suppose you for an opposit, and with Their cold Iron, gave you this midnight mark Of love. Their names, the shame, and error of Their anger, made them conceal. Clar. At my window, Sir! Leon. Claramante! Though in this City such Addresses are allow'd unto the fair And eminent, and that our Spanish custom Warrants Ladies in Musick to admit Their lovers, Evening and their Morning plaints. Yet since your Beauty doth disorder Men, Keep it within, lock up your looks? Clar. Brother, I hope, I have so liv'd, that you May think your counsel lost; for though I value it, yet sure I need it not. Leon. If I had hideous doubts, or knew to feed And nourish them with real circumstance, I wear a trifle here, should end your life, And my suspition ere you could have hope Or leasure to repent. Clar. Sir, though I strive to reverence your love, and care of my Repute, yet when I find your anger rais'd So high, as if you did presume Your Reason could allow't, then I disdain'd, And will have no honor, but what I can Protect without your help. Leon. Hear me. Be sure You live inclos'd! Keep to your Glass; and when Y'are weary with looking on your own face, I'll help you to another of the same sex. Clar. Forgive me Sir? Though I am innocent, I was not wise enough to find Your anger grows too high to be contemn'd. Leon. Obey what I enjoyn? for by My fathers soul, thy hopes of liberty Are but thy certainties of death. Dor. Fie Sir! how ill it doth become A gallant nature to mistake, and make Such an uncivil use of rage, to tempt A Ladies vertue to an angry blush? Leon. Good, unknown Sir! What make you here? Or, pray What do you find in me, that you should hope I have been us'd to be rebuk'd?: Arg. Cosin Leonte, this noble stranger cannot Offend so much, as he deserves to be excus'd. Balt. Brother, I ow him for my life. Had not His valor rescu'd it, I had not had The power to tell you now; he's fitter to Be made a friend, then enemy. Leon. Then I am apt to tell you Sir, y'have had The luck to save a life, more precious then Your own. If you affect your self, begone? And when you shall remember I have given You leave to live; you'll think your courtesie To him is overpaid. Dor. Good furious Sir; Make not a present of My life, until you know you can command it: I do not hold my breath by Patent, or By Lease; nor can I think, that your Celestial worship hath the pow'r to sign Such Grants. Leon. I thank you Sir. You have consider'd like a Gentleman, I am content, my house shall be your priviledge; But when remov'd from hence, you shall perceive This Province will be much too narrow to Contain us both alive. Exit Leonte. Balt. Claramante, let's hasten after him, He is unlucky in his fury, 'tis Not fit to trust him with such angry thoughts. You Argilo, and Gonsalvo, both Attend on Don Dorando here. Exeunt Balthazar, Claramante, Surgeon. Arg. Well may you wonder Sir, whil'st we lament At the miss govern'd temper of his youth, Who drowns a World of noble vertues in The torrent of his rage. Gonsal. Don Leonte is to blame, His courage like to powder, carelesly And ill laid up, is in continual danger Of ev'ry accidental spark that may Inkindle it to ruine. Dor. 'Tis most within The pow'r of time to mend. But Gentlemen, I am resolv'd such young mistaken wrath Shall never stir my anger, but my grief. Enter Claramante. Clar. Gentle Gonsalvo, And you my Cosin Argilo, I shall Entreat to hasten strait below, and wait Until this Gentleman descend, to make His passage forth secure. Exeunt Argilo, Gonsalvo. Dor. What means this Providence? Would I could hope. 'Tis not deriv'd from pitty, but from love. Clar. Are you a Native of this City, Sir? Dor. No Madam, my affairs convey'd me hither, Which though of great import, I value most Because they luckily became the means To make me fortunate in seeing you. Clar. I cannot guess, how I shou'd any way Contribute to your happiness, unless By my advice, my Brother Don Leonte hath A fire within his Brest, that nothing but Your blood can quench; his jealous honor waits For all occasions to become the Soldiers talk, His sword already hath been fatal to him, By a contempt of Civil Laws: And though it were A sin to doubt your valor can protect You from his rage: Yet being in this City lov'd, 'Tis fit to fear your stay may by His servants insolence, or faction of Misguided friends endanger you. Dor. I have not fear enough about me yet To understand, what 'tis you would infer. Clar. I speak to your discretion, Sir: Keep that Awake, and flie this Town, that can afford You now no quiet dwelling, but a Grave. Dor. Shall I that never yet knew fear, be taught It now, just now, when I do learn to love. Clar. What is it doth perswade your stay, brave Sir? Dor. Since 'tis the best and noblest cause, let it Be lawful to reveal't, my love of you, Although not known unto your eyes: 'Twas that Ingag'd me to the rescue of your Brothers life. Three Moons have waste I since my love increas'd, And I conceal'd the flame, first kindled by Your eye, when you did move in a devout Procession to our great Provincial Saint. Clar. That which fond men, misname my Beauty, is Become their fate; and so unlucky too, That I shall fear to see it in my Glass, Were I so false unto my self, To credit all, that say they love. Yet he Hath lost his vows, for since my heart hath given Her plight before, they needs must come too late. Dor. I hope this secret meditation doth Contrive no cruelty: Can you perswade My absence now? Clar. If you do truly love, You cannot chuse but value, and obey What I injoyn. The most convenient trial of Your truth, is that you follow strait, And hast you hence, and not return till you Have means to know, your visit may unto My Brother, and your self, be safe. Dor. Since my obedience seems the chiefest help T'advance my love, my honor may expect To be excus'd, when it is known I flie, 'Cause you're ally'd unto mine enemy. Exeunt. Enter Androlio (with a dark Lanthorn) Orgemon, Orco. Andr. Don Orgemon, you cannot guess, where I Have led you now? Orge. I hope 'tis to A secret entertainment of dry beating. Orco. If we be soundly cudgel'd (Gentlemen) Let's carry't privately; th'occasion will Require't. Orge. The furniture and spacious Roof, shews 'tis A house of quality. Orco. Yes faith. It may become A very right good Man to suffer in't. I had as lieve be pistoll'd here, as in Any house I know i'th' Town. Andr. This is my Mistress Mansion, Gentlemen. Orge. How? Amiana's! Does she live here? Andr. Her Fathers house believe't. Orge. A meet Nunnery, There's not so strict a Tenement in Spain. By this hand, the Women in't wear Hair Smocks. Orco. Art thou mad? in so debash'd and rude A season to bring us to a place Of such a known civility. Orge. Don Orco, I Dare warrant you the foresaid beating, and The Pistol too, you talk of, together With a brace of Bullets to boot. They are Not over frugal here of their Leaden Plums, To those that come a banqueting i'th' night. Enter Amiana. Amia. Who's there? Don Androlio? Andr. Quick, step aside Amiana. Amia. Speak softly Sir! For Heaven sake rule your voice, and strait inclose That light: If heard, or seen, we are undone. He shuts the Lanthorn. Andr. What was the cause that with such haste You sent for me. Amia. To number and interpret all your vows, So make them easie to your memory My jealous Father hath been told you oft Have made your visits here, suspects you false, And threatens ruine to our loves. Andr. These old coughing Coxcombs, are most Dangerous malicious Spies upon us, youth: They hate a midnight parley with their Daughters, And can seldom learn the good manners to Retire betimes into their Tombs, for the Convenience of young people. Amia. Your apprehension is too wanton Sir, And shares no part o'th' miseries I feel. Dispatch your Resolutions strait, if you Will keep your credit with high Heaven, where all Your promises are registred, and rid Me of my cruel fears; be early as The morning here, preparing some disguise To fetch me hence and marry me. Andr. Marry Amiana, is that the word? For me a trap to catch all Mankind in. A trick your old Law-makers first Found out to keep us tame. And then they fob Us off with stale deceptions of Prerogative, That every Husband is a Monarch in His family. Of what I pray? Of small Milk-eaters, that complain of breeding Teeth, And we of breeding them; till they Are weary too of us at last: So the Dislike goes round. Amia. Why do you meditate, As if this business did require new thoughts? Andr. Is there a soft Bed here? Amia. What do you mean? Doth sleep invade you, Sir? Are you not well? Andr. Would you were half so well in understanding. What pity 'tis, one of thy hopeful being, Should want capacity in natural Affairs. By this good Darkness thou delight'st To vex me; if there be joys, are they Not greater by our liberty, and less When we that make them are confin'd? Amia. I hope, I am not well Indeed; and 'tis my understanding that Is sick, or I would have it so, rather Then know your meaning. Andr. Come pretty thief; Though these are fitting hours for stealth, our robberies Shall be but interchanging what's our own. Amia. Away, begone. Although my Faith cannot Perswade me all this vanity comes from Thy heart, yet I abhor it on thy Tongue. My foolish love forbids me chide thee more; Yet thou wilt find my anger easier far Then Heavens. Exit. Andr. Don Orgemon! Orco! Orco. What a cold sweat y'have left us in? I spy'd One single glowing coal, i'th' Chimny of The Weather Room, and thought 't had been a Muskettier With his Match cock'd. Andr. Gentlemen, do you see the Key That opens to this blind Paradice? this will I lend, when either of your Constitutions call Upon me to make way unto my Mistress. Orco. But what success (Androlio) she being chaste? Andr. Why then corrupt her, you shall have my help; That's fair I think: If you would both be rul'd. By me, we'd lead such pleasant envy'd lives. The great Turk himself shou'd leave his business And his throne, to make a fourth among us. Orco. As how? Now do I grow a little sensual. Andr. Our Mistresses in common, that's the way; Each may apply himself t'assist his friend. Think on those blessed Greeks that had the skill Of mutual procuration. Oh how Deliciously they liv'd! What pity 'tis, that this Dull age admits it not in fashion now. If we would help each other heartily, Strait all the sex were ours. Orge. Think you so Sir. Andr. Yes, and without the miseries of Matrimony, Let Haberdashers marry, and those poor Shop Traffickers, that spend their precious hours In narrow Lanes. Orco. Who are a kind of pious Eunuchs, and their Wives Your Concubines, whom they keep for your use At their own charge. Andr. Y'are in the right. Orge. Orco would get a pretty nimble way Of profiting, if he be well taught. Andr. You have a secret Mistress, Orgemon, I prethee bring me to her. Orge. No Sir, I'am content To manage my own fortune without help. Andr. Orco, you have a handsome Sister, make My way that I may visit her. Orco. How Sir! You must make your own way then with your Sword. Andr. Th'art not intirely cleans'd from folly yet. Like to a Gun ill cleans'd, thou dost recoil At the first charge. If you like my sister, Appoint your time, and I will do my best. Orco. I, that may mollifie. Andr. She'll make a proper Woman; but The mischief is, she's yet but three years old. A young Bird, thou may'st catch her with a Cherry. Orge. My hour draws on, and my affairs require That I should walk alone, I prethee lead me outâ Andre. He is a Schollar, let him take His learned way, poor melancholly Angler, He must fish with those Philosophical Worms, He finds in rotten Books. Thou (Orco) and My self (if we do faithfully conspire) Will lay such subtle Baits, as first shall vex Our own, then vanquish all the other sex. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Balthazar and Dorando. Balt. Those scatter'd streaks of paleness in the East, Declare the day so near, the Sun scarce needs To travel half an hour to perfect it, The Port will open strait, and there you'll find My Page attend you with a Horse. Dor. Your tenderness, and careful Gratitude, Will by example benefit the World, And teach ill Natures to do good; if not For Vertues sake, yet in a hope to gain By the reward; let me request you (Sir) To cherish nicely your dear life, which may Be useful unto all mankind: Your wound Will yet require the Surgeons help, and such Untimely moving in the piercing air (perhaps) Retard the Cure, I pray return. Balt. 'Tis your civility to mind it (Sir) Else I should lack the means to think I have That wound which I can hardly feel, Since y'are a stranger, and by a request (Through a becoming care of safety) make Such haste to leave the Town, perhaps your wants May find this little treasure of some use, Be pleas'd to make it yours. Dor. I shall have need Of nothing but your absence (Sir) and that Is useful to me, 'cause it may concern Your health; pray leave me, and return. Balt. Let me attend you but a little further, Perchance I have a Mistress, whose dwelling near The Port, I would (in my obedience to The custom here) salute with Musick when She wakes. Dor. Nor yet am I So old, but you may think I have A Mistress too, whom I would celebrate; And these affairs ask single secrecy. I do beseech you leave me. Balt. My better wishes wait upon you ever. Dor. Mine Sir on you. Although your vertue be So strong, it doth prevent all other aids. Exeunt severally. Enter Leonte. Leon. 'Twas by some secret whisperings of love Enjoy'd before: If Don Dorando really Had been a stranger to my sister, and As new to her, as me, he had not grown So bold in her defence; if it be love, 'Tis apt enough to my conjecture. He May take the usual way of early sacrifice In amorous airs. Just here, her Window doth O'er-look our Garden Wall; I'll wait For his approach, if singly (as such stoln Addresses commonly are made) he will Be fitter for my Sword; nor would I by Unequal force, discharge, and satisfie My Anger, to my Honors loss. Enter Musicians. 1. Mus. This is the place. Diego, is the Base-Viol mended which Th'young Lacky batter'd with a Torch? 2. Mus. Tigh'd as a Bladder. 1. Mus. Stand all close Beneath The Penthouse; there's a certain Chambermaid From yond Casement, will dash us else. She was Ever very free of her Urineâ Leon. Sure Don Dorando sprung this tame Covy! Friend! who employ'd you here? 1. Mus. A Gentleman Lover, Sir. Leon. I guess it is no City lover; For he'd have eas'd his mind with the Town Waits. Know you his name. 1. Mus. Good Sir forbear: You hinder our tuningâ Leon. Prethee his name. 1. Mus. It is a stranger Sir, he will be here After the first Madrigal. Leon. That stile of stranger, shews it must be he. Song in Parts. [1.] None but my self, my heart did keep, When I on Cowslip-Bed did sleep; Neer to a pleasant Bog: Whilst you my pretty Rogue, With Knuckle knocking at my Brest, Did ask for my Three corner'd Ghest. And whispering soft (as soft as voice could be) Did say come out thou little Heart to me. A thousand Fiends as black as Soot, With all their dirty Dams to boot. Take thee, O take thee every day, For tempting my poor Heart away: 2. This Heart for joy, from me did leap, And follow'd thee even step by step Till tir'd, it ask'd to rest A while within thy Brest. 'Twas thick, and fat, and plump before, Weighing a full pound weight and more. But now (alas) 'tis wasted to the Skin, And grown no bigger then the Head of Pin. A thousand Fiends as black as Soot, With all their dirty Dams to boot. Take thee, O take thee every day, For tempting my poor Heart away. Enter Orgemon. Orge. There's your reward, avoid the place. 'Tis strange Exeunt Musicians. She not returns me her accustomed favor; Neither by th'sudden comfort of her eyes, Nor one restrain'd soft whisper, to declare Her fears. Claramante! Break forth Thou living Light, the Planet of the day Makes constant haste to shine on ev'ry one, Because insensible, and cannot know The value of his Beams; but thou (Of worthier Essence far then he) art nice And chary of thy lustre, 'cause Thy reason tells thee, what is precious should Be most reserv'd. Claramante! Leon. If there be vertue in that name, it is Not fit it should receive a blemish from Thy voice: If there be none, thou newly Hast corrupted what I thought was pure. Orge. What are you that so rudely dare prophane A Lovers rites? Those single privacies, The custom of this Province doth allow. Leon. Don Dorando, 'tis not thy want of memory, Doth make my person or my voice estrang'd Unto thy knowledge, but thy guilt. Time hath But added a few hours to our account, Since thou with insolence didst injure, whom Thou now dost fear to know. Orge. This scarcity of light, wanting enough Of day t'inform thy eyes, makes thee mistake I am not he thou nam'st. Leon. Dost thou deny thy self? That which before did seem thy valor, was No more then a disease, within thy blood; 'Thath intermissions, and doth reign by fits. Orge. Prethee (who e'er thou art) befriend thy self With my advice, for thine own safety, not For mine, I wish thee leave this place. Leon. Your easie temper will deceive you Sir; Although I scorn to conquer him that is Not willing to resist, I'll force you strait, If not to courage, yet to anger. Thusâ Strikes him. Orge. Rash busie Fool, 'tis now too late t'allay They draw, They fight. That Spirit thou hast rais'd. Enter Claramante above, with a light. Clar. Who are you that with rudely manag'd Swords, Foretel so much of danger and of death? Orge. Thy valor did deserve a better cause, But 'tis not timely to instruct thee now: Yield or thou diest. Orgemon bestrides Leonte. Clar. Ay me, the voice of Orgemon, My Brother too, disarm'd, prostrate, and grown The yielded subject of his rage. Orge. Ha! thy Brother! Life of my heart! Had we but had thine eyes T'enlighten us, this dark misprision could A Torch ready. Not so betray me, to oppose one, whom My better knowledge might embrace. Clar. If there be any mercy in thy love, give not Thy anger leave to make a bloody use Of victory? Orge. For all the avaricious World calls Wealth, I would not shed the blood that is ally'd To thine. Rise Sir, and thank your sister for Your life, and sword. Gives him his Sword. Leon. I shall disdain 'em both, Unless my fortune make me fit For better gratitude; which is, when I Have conquer'd thine to give them back. Runs at him, they fight again. Clar. Cruel, and rash! Dost thou pervert the use Of my request. Help, help! Orgemon is wounded. Orge. Claramante, thy pity which did save Thy Brothers life, hath now endanger'd mine. Clar. Gonsalvo, help! My Cosin Argilo. Goes from the Window, and calls within. Leon. He seems, by th'half discernings of this light, To shrink with loss of blood. I fear I shall Have cause to curse my first mistake. I'll haste Unto the next Monastick-house to keep Me from the rigor of the Laws. Exit. Orge. Where art thou fled! Have I a wound, and not An enemy, on whom I may reveng't. Enter Claramante above. Clar. Art thou in danger noble Orgemon? I fear to ask what's cruelty to know. Orge. My gentle Love, disquiet not thy heart With kind suspitions, for my wound Is neither deep nor hazardous. Clar. Thy safety reconciles me to my Stars Now they descend! Give trust unto my Cosin Argilo, Unless he should perswade thee hither; for The malice of this house may ruine thee. Orge. Wilt thou depart, that art my better life. Clar. My honor and my pity, call me hence, I dare no longer see thee, nor be seen. Exit. Enter Argilo, Gonsalvo, with a Torch. Orge. Keep back, I've yet another arm that may Be prosperous for my defence. Arg. Don Orgemon! This is a noble Lord, I know his love to Claramante full Of loyalty; without suspition, Sir, you may Receive from me the office of a friend. Gons. I'th' calm and sleepy season of The night, Leonte stole abroad: I fear He hath been guilty of this rash assault. Arg. It seems there's danger in his deed, for he Is fled: Be confident we'll serve you Sir, How do you find your strength? Orge. I onely feel my Fortune weak, if you Are worthy, as your promise renders you, Conduct me to the Lodging near the Bridge. Gons. I know it well; it is the Marblehouse. Arg. We'll both attend you thither. Exeunt. Enter Orco like a Fidler. Androlio aloof of. Orco. This is a tame Street-hound, of the right strain; Now he hath found my footing, 'twill be hard To shake him off: He'll follow by the scent, Like an old Tyger. Andr. You have your early walks, Orco. I know you by your Aggot eyes, and your Cinnamon face: Whether I'faith? tell me! You mean to firk it with your Fidlestick. Orco. If thou lov'st me go back, I've a design For thy good; but I would fain trust to my Own head. The day will open presently And then my project is quite spoil'd. Andr. Yes, a Court project, which no Man gets by But the Inventor; who is long in paying of Himself, and at the last is soundly paid: But I will stand to all unwholsome hazards, And bear you company. Orco. You must excuse me Androlio; by this hand, 'tis a devout design. Andr. Faith like enough; you go to fiddle gratis At the wedding of some poor Orphan Maid. Orco. Prethee go back. Andr. Come, I begin to find you false. Doth not Our late Indenture, bind us both to help Each other for the common good of Women, And so to make our own enjoyings sure. Thou hast a secret Mistress, and I think Dost hide her under ground, like a Rose Imbalm'd within a Leaden Pot to keep it fresh. Orco. Or as our Seamen bury Beef; but if Thou findst her out, thou'lt powder her. Andr. Thou art as valiant as a Machabee, And shouldst be true, shall I trust thee alone? Orco. Androlio, if thou wilt leave me, I will tell thee all. Andr. As how? Proceed. Orco. There is a certain Wenchâ Andr. Good! A Wench! The very thing I want. If thou lov'st me, let her have black eyes. Pray on, a Wench! Orco. The Daughter of an Advocate. Andr. Good still! I love to procreate with the Law; For I would have my issue thrive. Orco. This foresaid Wench, sighing in her Window, Gave me the gentle leer as I pass'd by; And I that had the blessed happiness To be born for her undoing, return'd her (You know my old guard of Love-fence) the half wink thusâ Andr. That's my way too, I taught it you. But mark Me Orco. You must not now prove negligent In a good cause. Orco. Dost think I am so wicked; She's newly blown, and I am going now To make her ripe. Andr. Honest Rogue farewel. Goes to the door and returns. D'ye hear Orco? I needs must have this Wench; Remember how our Covenants are drawn. Orco. Be confident, and leave me. Andr. Nay, thou art right. To morrow I'll procure for thee. Goes to the door again, and returns. Orco, thou dost not know what extraordinary use I have for an Advocates Daughter. Orco. I'm sensible, I prethee go, my friends Necessities I tender as mine own. Exit Androlio. I'l give him a false turn i'th' corner of The next blind Lane, that I may safer move In my design. Goes off, and enter again at the other door. I've lost him now! The Rogue's as cunning as a travel'd Spie. But I shall couzen him. This is the house, Or I mistook my mark last night. Sings a Mock-song, to a Ballad Tune. Good morrow to the Honorable Dona Amiana, And toth' Right Worshipful her little Dog. Enter Amiana above, with a Paper with God in't. Amia. You are too loud! I know thee not; and I Presume thou dost not know thou wak'st my enemies: For in this house the jealous live, who are Such cruel Judges of my thoughts and words, That I grow weary of all hope, but what Infers my death. Although thy Musick's harsh, I'll pay thy courtesie: there's Gold, begone. Throws him Money. Orco. Pretty Varlet! Now am I melting, soft All over, as a quodled Apple, I'll thred These Duckets on a Fiddle-string, and wear Them for a Bracelet. Amia. What shall I do? Although my Father hazard me at home, It may be danger to adventure forth. Musician, are you gone? Orco. Here, dear Lady. So conquer'd by your bounty, that I'm e'en Setting my Fiddle to the tune of Dying dumps, If you would grace me with commands, you shall Perceive I dare attempt as far as Orpheus did, That plaid a Jiggin Hell; there I have nick'd her With a complement. Amia. Govern your words, And then beware your promises exceed Not what you can perform, yet I have heard Course habits often cover mighty minds. Know you Don Androlio, the Nephew to The Governor? Orco. Do I know a Ducket when I see't? I am to play before His worship this very morning; he makes My love Ballads. The merry Madrigal. For Maids, and the Vicious Virgin, were both his. Amia. I know him vain, wild, and ungovern'd as Th'assembling winds; yet if thou'lt safely bring Me to his house, I'll make thee rich with my Rewards; but be thou sure, thou use me not With rude, uncivil violence; for then His anger, and my kinreds pow'r will seek Thee out, as far as day is known, to ruine thee With their revenge. Orco. 'Lass, Madam, I am call'd The faithful Fidler of Cordua. Boldly Adventure, for my life shall warrant you. Amia. There is no staying here, to my infirm And troubled sence, it doth appear as safe To hazard what is doubtful there, as undergo What certainly is worse then death within. Exit. Orco. She's coming down I hope, Don Androlio. When you did bring Don Orgemon, and me Last night to see your Mistress in this house; Your Brains (I take't) did you no great good service. If I bring her to yours (although I've made A kind of Poetical promise to That small purpose) may this become my lasting trade, And I sing my own story under the title Of the lowsie Lover. Enter Amiana vail'd. Amia. Good friend, where are you? Orco. Ready to serve you. Ha? Her face vail'd? No matter, I shall see all in the Green-Chamber. Amia. First take that Jewel to invite your faith: Which if perform'd with Loyalty, It shall receive a larger recompence; But still remember, what a punishment Attends on treacherous Deeds: And as You honor Heaven, make haste, before The business of the people fill the streets. Orco. I shall consider as I walk, whether I gain'd her with my face, or voice; for both Are excellent. Exeunt. Enter Orgemon, and one Servant. Orge. That Key opens my Cabinet; Reward The Surgeon well: Although my wound (I hope) Will need no more his Med'cine, nor his care. Be still within my call. 1 Serv. I shall Sir. Exit. Orge. O love! Thy wonders might create a story that Would fill all Books: 'Tis strange a pow'r so soft, And ever young, should be so tyrannous, And strong! 'Tis in obedience to thy will That Don Leonte lives; and adds this morn To's short account of time. And 'tis the same Obedience keeps my Honor in such aw, That he must still survive the date of my Revenge. Enter 1 Servant. 1 Serv. A Gentleman importunate With haste, and business, desires to speak with you. Orge. Admit him in. Exit 1 Servant. Enter Claramante, in mans habit. Clar. Sir, I perceive You gaze and seek for something in my face, That you would seem to know: And sure, if I Had courage to display, what I must bashfully Decline and hide; you'ld soon restore it to Your memory, and then give me a name. Orge. Claramante! My wonder to behold Thee thus, and here, will scarce give place unto My joy! How rarely fashion'd is thy courtesie? Clar. I knew no way (most Loyal Orgemon!) That would so much become my gratitude As thus, t'obliege you with the trust, both of My honor and my life; whose life and honor, I Of late, with my unequal pity did Betray: But I have hope my urgent pray'r Hath kept all danger from your wound. Orge. It is Too apt for cure, too slight to merit such A recompence; you give, my Gentle Mistress, So much new ornament to our course sex, By serving of it now; that I suspect Ere long, you will neglect your own. Clar. I do so fear my own disguise, that I tremble in the light far more Then other Virgins in the dark, as if The Law did follow me for stealing of My borrow'd shape. I shrink like th'Indian flowr Which creeps within its folded Leaves when it Is touch'd, asham'd that men should come so near't. Orge. 'Tis a disguise, thy need of safety will allow. Clar. You shall conceal me from my Brothers wrath, Until the Priest by holy Rites hath made Us fitting to appear in publick view. Orge. This house will soon be subject to his eyes, And to your kinreds search, but ere their rage Or watchful malice, can have time to find You out, I will convey you hence unto Some place more secret and remote. Enter Androlio. Andr. What, lock'd up like a Relick Sir? Ere long A man must bow three paces off to him That shews your picture. My dear Don! how go Affairs? This is a mad Town, the very race Of mankind in't, are all turn'd Cats: Such climbing Into Windows, clambering over house-tiles, And scratching for Females was near heard of Since first the hot Moor's did overcome Spain, And met with our Grand-mothers in the dark. Orge. Was this last night? And things of moment done? By whom I pray? Androl. Odds skirmishes have pass'd, But who were actors in't, I cannot hear. Orge. No person cheif in the disorder nam'd? Andr. I tell you no, they bear their follies out With gravity; a kind of slie State-sinners Sir, And we are Village-Fools: For though we find Great mischeifs still are done, we never know By whom. What Gentleman is this? Orge. One I'll prefer to your acceptance Sir, My Cosin, and an Heir. Andr. Will he be bound! Orge. 'Las! he is but in's teens. Andr. What does he then abroad? Let him keep home, Till the Wax be ready, and the Bonds drawn. Orge. Androlio lend me your ear: You are Arriv'd hither most opportunely for my use. Andr. It may be so, 'tis more though, then I meant. Orge. That I confess; yet prethee be but sad A while, or serious (which thou wilt) and take A Secret from me, that concerns me much. Andr. Quick then! For I've a Secret business too: Just when the Clock strikes nine, I am to meet An Advocates Daughter. Orge. That may be done Without impediment, to what I shall Impose. This Gentleman with strictest care Must be conceal'd within your house to night; His honor suffers much, if he be found. Andr. Is he to fight? I'll be his second. Orge. There's something of a Duel in't, and though His years promise no miracles of strength, Yet he hath Seeds of Courage, and will yield To nothing that he thinks an injury. Andr. You know my way, we'll fight it two to two, That Norman Fencer which I kept, is dead. Oh! he was a rare murderer; but I Have all his rules. Orge. No words to him (Androlio) That may intimate a quarrel, as you love me. Andr. Enough: when I suspect my Tongue, I'll take It out, and lock it in my Cabinet. Goes to Claramante. Sir, I do seldom make requests, but since Ally'd unto my Friend, I shall desire I may have leave to serve you. Clar. Your favor Sir, hath made a most unworthy choice; But I shall daily hasten to deserv't. Andr. A pretty bashful fellow. I'll enter him Upon the mad GirlsâGive me thy hand. For thy sake (Orgemon) he shall begin With the Advocates Daughter. Claramante takes Orgemon aside. Clar. Have pity (Sir) upon my fears. I hope You will not trust me in his house, He seems so wild, and wickedly inclin'd, I dare not hope for safety where he dwels. Orge. Poor troubled heart, dismiss those needless fears, Your safety is assur'd in your disguise. The time is short you are to stay with him, And then his character (so known unto Your friends) will hinder all suspition of Your being there; besides although his wantonness Lessens his worth, unto a strangers eye, I know his valor will not suffer him To fail my trust. Andr. Lead the way. Clar. My Fortune is as wearisome And doubtful to me, as this borrow'd shape. Orge. Yet know my beauteous friend, he that Foretels his own calamity, and makes Events before they come, 'twice over, doth Endure the pains of evil destiny. But we must trust to Vertue, not to Fate That may protect, whom cruel Stars will hate. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Androlio, and second Servant. Androlio. When I had got fit leasure to peruse her, (Besides that fair perspicuous Text, her Face) I saw a World of little Marginal Notes, That prov'd significant enough to doubt her. Yet when I told her oft, the poor fool wept, And that alacrity of weeping shews She is a woman: A slight shallow trick, And shallow Waters cannot part us two, I must wade over; then when I grew a little rude, She seem'd angry, that shews too she is a woman. But when through a small cranny of the door, I spy'd her folding up her hair behind; What needed more to make her guilty, and Me guilty too, if she'd consent; but 'tis a cold Girl, Or else she counterfeits. Is the fine young Gentleman stirring yet? 2 Serv. He wak'd long since, Sir, and is now at's pray'rs. Andr. How! At pray'rs! Even that alone's enough To shew she is a Gentlewoman. Go wait without. Exit 2d Servant. When I did fool, and strive to kiss her, The peevish ape drew out a Ponyard. Enter Claramante in Mans habit. Clar. Good morrow Sir; Good thoughts to you Sir, and I hope so good A wish is welcome to your ear. A Letter and Purse. Andr. You are no Lady yet. Clar. Although I want perswasion Sir, to rule Your thoughts, I trust your own civility Will rule your deeds. Weeps. Andr. More dropping show'rs From such a Skie, as should not entertain A Cloud: A Gentleman weep! Who ever saw't before! Scarce at a Funeral, But when his Sire dy'd poor; or blush, but when He went to borrow Money, and then it was For very shame, the party would not lend it. Clar. I shall begin to wish I were More wicked then I am; if others faults Can onely make up a disguise to keep Me safe from greater sins. Andr. Come my fair Masculine, last night You know I did desist in pity to Your bashfulness; for it is fit We grow acquainted ere we love. But now I hope you'll pity me. Steps to her, she steps back. Clar. If you have noble Honor in you, I Am sure you dare not foully break the trust Of Orgemon your friend. Andr. A friend! A very new one! Here he sways the Town, And we not know his Province, nor his Birth. It is but vain To iterate what I said before. I find He sent you hither for a tryal of My eyes, and wit; Should I not know you as A gallant ought, he would extreamly scorn me. Let me but share the favors you confer On him, my friend and I are one: Clar. If that be possible, I shall believe Vertue and Truth are onely names on Earth, And their realities are fled to Heaven. Weeps. Andr. Weeping again? I am a Thousand Turks If sh'ave not quite corrupted me! I must Weep tooâBut say I prove so curs'd A villain now, as to have a mind to her In my tearsâHuge double drops, I swear! Enter Second Servant. 2 Serv. Don Orco, Sir, desires to speak with you. Andr. Ha! Orco! Is he below, and a Wench with him? 2 Serv. No Sir, alone, and in great haste he comes T'invite you to his lodging. Andr. I hope the small She-Advocate is there. Sir, If you'll but survey the Lease within, You'll find the House is yours, I pray retire. I dare leave her, she hath not courage to Go forth alone i'th' open day: Besides, I know her inclination's kind, and unto me In cheif. Why came she hither else? Exit. Clar. Sir, Sir, allow me but a word, and take This Purse before you grant what I request. 2 Serv. Good Sir, I'faith it is too much. Clar. Thou shalt have more at thy return, If with true secrecy and speed (unknown Unto thy Master) thou inquire the dwelling of Don Orgemon, and deliver him this Letter. 2 Serv. Strait Sir, I will not stay to weigh your Gold Exit. Clar. Unless my written sorrows hasten thee To fetch me hence, I ne'er shall see thee Orgemon: My eyes will melt away so fast. Exit. Enter Balthazar, Leonte, Gonsalvo, Argilo. Balt. Brother, you need not throw your eyes About the Street as if you fear'd the Laws; For I am told Don Orgemon is well. Leon. His Fortune gives him fatisfaction then (And amply too) for my mistake. Gons. Sure Orco dwels within this broad arch'd building? It will be equisit we here begin our search. Arg. Most consequent; for he was early seen In an assum'd fantastick dress, leading A Lady in disguise. Balt. Knock at the Gate Gonsalvo. He knocks. Leon. Break it open, why should we use our cause So mannerly? We come not here to make A formal visit, but to find a sister, Stoln and betray'd. Balt. Hold Gentlemen. Brother You are too violent: We shall not save But ruine Claramantes Honor, if By noise and rude disorder, we provoke The people to observe that she is fled From home; nor are we certain she is here. Enter Third Servant. Gons. We come in business to your Master (friend) Request him hither. 3 Serv. My Master Sir, is not within. Arg. Gonsalvo, lay you hold upon that fellow, And keep him safe, whilst Balthazar and I Enter and search the house. You Don Leonte May guard the Gate, t'examine those That make their passage forth. Exeunt Balthazar, Argilo. Leon. You slave, if you call out, or strive for your Deliverance, here's that shall spoil your voice. Draws his Dagger. Gons. He will be rul'd, his courage never comes Upon him until Noon, and then He triumphs Sir. Leon. If we do miss her here, our nearest hope Will be to seek her where Don Orgemon Resides; and he again shall try to expiate His saucy error with his sword. Gons. But Claramante must Be gently us'd; for I suspect it is Your harsh demeanor, hath provok'd her to This ill becoming remedy. Leon. 'Tis likely by my Brother's stay, he hath Already found her here. Enter Balthazar, Argilo, Amiana vail'd. Balt. I have inquir'd as high, as to the heads Of Chimneys, and as low as to the feet Of Wells; yet found no Virgin (Sir) but this. Arg. She's a distress'd one too, or else she doth Dissemble sorrow very cunningly. Balt. All hidden, but your eyes Lady, such care to be conceal'd, would cause Unkind observers to suspect you have Some faults: If not acquainted with your name, Yet make us known unto your face. Amia. I hardly know myself, I'm so Unfortunate; y'have heard the story of My wrong, how, and by whom misled into This place; and with what aids of Tears, and Pray'rs, I have preserv'd my honor. Balt. 'Tis happy that Is safe, I wonder much a Gentleman Should so unworthily demean himself. Amia. If you have Seeds of true compassion Sir, Unvail me not; but clouded thus, convey Me to some private dwelling, where my fears May be the worst, I shall endure. Leon. This is some Virgin, you may hire at a Far easier rate, then your solliciting. She's choicely bred to entertain Gallants. Balt. Brother y'are too cruel! proceed upon Your search, and I'll attend you strait. Gonsalvo, force that humble Officer Along with you, till we are parted from his reach. Exeunt Leonte, Gonsalvo, Argilo, 3 Servant. Amia. I made but little use of Precepts, should I not forgive such injuries as scorn; The careless hazard of my Fame deserves Much more, and I have patience to allow't. Balt. You teach me (Lady) to believe, and to Lament your sufferings, I will conduct You strait unto a lodging, you may trust For honest worth, and privacy. Amia. My better Angel (Sir) I hope hath some Affinity with yours, and both conspir'd To send you hither for your own renown, And my felicity. Balt. What dull, ignoble Devil could in all His Brest, find out a thought to wrong such eyes? Exeunt. Enter Orco, Androlio. Andr. Orco, do not I know the latitude of The narrow compass of thy head: Perswade Me not (if thou believ'st I have one ounce Of Brains within mine own) that thou couldst get My Mistress to thy Lodging by this trick. Orco. I have not sanctity enough to do A miracle; and therefore am content To think this none: But here she is! Here you Shall see her too, unless Women And watching have destroy'd your sight. Andr. Is this the Advocates Daughter? Orco. As much of her as I could reach, upon Such short preparatives of wit. And this (as I Imagine too) had been detain'd from you a while, But that the wicked thing prov'd chaste. Andr. Confess l'faith? You know I still absolve These pretty venial sins in all that date Themselves beneath fourscore: How didst thou find her? Orco. A little odd! The silly Elf hath been Ill taught, she understood me not at first, But I (that spare no pains t'inculcate doctrine of This kinde) told her my purpose in rare words, And then she call'd unto her help, a race Of strange and unheard of friends. Andr. Ha! Who were they? Orco. People above the Clouds? Old Saints, hard names Of such as you, and I ne'er knew, but in The Kalender. Andr. This Chit would be rebuk'd; But 'tis a foolish way she hath long us'd. Orco. I thought she would have catechiz'd my Man, Gave him a Rosary of Beads, with good council, And the dull Slave began to listen too: For let me tell you, he's a very great Misleader of Weavers, And may in time make a Rebellion. Andr. Well! No hope then of success? Orco. 'Faith I began to doubt the worst, and so Committed her unto a Cushion, and A little Pocket Book, lock'd in her Chamber. Andr. Orco, a Man of weak experience in This transitory World, would grow enrag'd At such uncomfortable Plots as these. Be jealous of his Mistress, wake betimes, And call you to the Field in Slippers and Your Shirt, with your Sword drawn! But I (who know These fond calamities are incident To Vertue) do forgive thee, and will have Our Covenants new sign'd, that the old league Of mutual procuration may be strait renew'd. Orco. Agreed! I cannot venture much! Andr. Knock at your door: I would fain see her. Orco knocks. Orco. It seems my man is not o'er-vex'd with cares, For I believe he's fast asleep. Knocks again. Enter Third Servant. How Sirrah? My door's lock'd, and you abroad? 3 Serv. O Sir, I am undone! Orco. Undone! Why art thou marry'd? Fool, since I went forth? 3 Serv. No, but the Lady (Sir) you left unto My charge, was carry'd hence by Gentlemen, And my self forc'd t'attend their company, Till she was led I know not where. Orco. The Lady gone! Andr. Orco, a very ordinary Nose May scent your stratagem. This was a trick To magnifie your wit, fable, and figment; Orco, my Mistress is at home, and (as I take't) was never here. Orco. Caitiff! What Gentlemen were those that took The Lady hence? 3 Serv. I know not Sir, nor whether they are gone. Andr. Come shift your fooling vizard off, you may Appear in your own face: I knew before I was but gull'd, and will vouchsafe to be So ev'ry day, in hope to mend thy Brain With exercise. Orco. Y'are merry Sir? Perhaps at your own charge? Enter Second Servant. Andr. How now! Are you undone too? 2 Serv. Worse Sir, the Gentleman you left at home Is fled. Andr. Fled Sir! What out at the Window? 2 Serv. No Sir, a Hors-back. They bound me fast. Orco. Sure Androlio this is a fable too. Androlio takes Orco aside. Andr. Come, I suspect you are a Traytor, and Have double Plots. This sounds like your mischeif. 2 Serv. No truly Sir, the stranger was seduc'd By one Don Orgemon. Andr. Don Orgemon, Villain! Which way took they? 2 Serv. Through Jaques Port, towards Anselmo's Wood. Andr. Five miles distant from hence: It carries much Of likelihood. Orco, lend me a horse. Orco. You shall ride me, because you have the better wit. Andr. Hire me some slaves; get me my midnight vizards, And my false robes. Haste Sirrah, as you prize Your life; it will be easie to o'ertake 'em. I would not for the Crown of Spain bear this Defeat, my Statue will be cut mounting A Marble Ass, with huge unmeasurable ears. Orco. And mine leading that Ass bare foot In Procession For my folly, unless I find your Mistress. Exeunt. Enter Orgemon, Claramante, in a Womans Riding habit, and one Servant. Orge. To make us free from all inquiry, when We are pursu'd, Lead on the Horses towards Cordua, and leave us in this Wood. 1 Serv. Your Cabinet and Garments I have laid, I'th' lower Hermitage. Heaven protect you Sir. Exeunt 1 Servant. Orge. The wild condition of these Woods you'll finde More innocent and safer then a Temple, if Androlio sojourn'd in't. He shall be forc'd To render me a strict account for this Abhor'd attempt, I did not think he could Be seriously inclin'd to ill, although I knew he had some guilt of levity And youth, which unjust custom doth excuse. Clar. The threatnings of my little strength, and all My anger, had not kept my honor free, Without the sudden help of Heaven, that did Divert his thoughts. Orge. It is the lasting vice Of our ill-fashion'd Sex, to think those injuries We do to yours; but pretty triumphs; As if it were a dignity in youth, to have The pow'r and judgment to betray. Clar. Renowned Orgemon! When you are crown'd with many years, and your Best Star invites you to an upper orb Eternally to shine, and keep it company, Succeeding Virgins then shall sacrifice Their Songs, their Sighs, unto your Fame, and praise Your kind confession of those wrongs they still receive on Earth. Orge. Move softly on, and mark the place Where on you tread, for your dissent Is sleep and dangerous. Clar. What is that Cell Or Hermitage, to which you guide me now? Orge. A place of secret Sanctity, where we Securely may reside, until my Confessor By Rites of holy Priesthood, tie Our hearts and hands, with that mysterious knot Which all your Brothers eminence and strength Cannot dissolve. Clar. Then I shall lose My freedom, whilst by force of Formal Law, And a devout necessity, I must Become the subject of your power, who was The Mistress of your Love. A dreadful change! But such (I hope) as you will manage we'l. Orge. Though I a Scepter held, And my Imperial Rule O'ershadow'd all the Earth (for surely vaste Authority keeps all below it, in The dark) yet I should ne'er permit my pow'r To lessen, or to spoil my love. Clar. Are you assur'd you move directly in Our way? this path is diversly inclin'd, And will occasion a mistake. Orge. Be confident, I have been here before. Enter Androlio disguised, and others in Vizards. Andr. Seize on her strait, and bind him to a Tree, Use no discourse, nor violence that may Endanger him, though he resist. Orge. Villains restore my Sword, then yield Me space to manage it, and strengthned with This cause, I will inforce my way. They bind him to a Tree, Androlio lays hold on Claramante, she kneels. Clar. If you believe there are rewards or punishments Above, desist from what you cruelly Intend; there is an Eye more sensible, And greater then the Sun, that sees What you are doing. Org. Claramante, be not Thy own destroyer with thy fears, these (sure) Are but thy Brothers instruments, and though Incenc'd against me, his nature cannot suffer him To touch thy honor, or thy life. Clar. I am your prisoner (Sir) I yield my self, So you will free Don Orgemon. Androlio delivers her to the rest. Orge. Curs'd at our Births, the Stars are all our Enemies. Clar. Why should I fear the life I carry hence, When I must leave the pleasure of it here. They carry her off. Andr. This wondrous Wealth is yet got without blood! And all your witty arts upon me, are Reveng'd: Friendship is folly, when we suffer it To hinder us of what we dearly love Whilst young. W'are wise when we our pleasure gain, All other documents are grave, but vain. Exit. Orge. Don Leonte! If thou art he dares own That name, grant freedom to my Tongue, if not To me, and hear me speak. Dost thou disdain Me in my Bonds, Villain! Thy cruelty, if written would outlast The noble story of thy sisters love. Enter Dorando. Dor. Who is it that complains of love? Or is't The eccho of mine own unquiet voice? Or is't some lover vainly come to boast His sorrow in these Woods. Let him but lay his ear unto my Brest, And he shall find such loud disorders there, As will perswade him he doth hear my thoughts Without th'assistance of my Tongue, take down His Sails, as if becalm'd for want of sighs, Whilst I am shipwreck'd with a lasting storm. Orge. If all these sufferings, be true, thou art Become so skilful and intelligent In girls, I need not doubt thou wilt believe Mine fit for a redress. Dor. Bound to a Tree! His locks declare, that he Hath honor in him, and his language, love. Where was my Sword, and I, when such an act Should be perform'd, I guess you well deserve Your liberty, and am resolv'd to give it you. Unbinds him. Orge. It was a sin to take this courtesie. Can it become my hands t'accept their freedom, when My heart is made a Captive. Dor. These your complaints cannot Be easily understood by me. Orge. The Mistress of my life was here surpris'd, forc'd hence; Led to endure horrid uncertainties, And doubts of dying by her Brothers wrath, She whom my vertue and my honor lov'd. Dor. Inforc'd from hence, let's follow Sir, and force Her back. If thou dost truly love, thy valor will Be mighty in thy Mistress cause. Orge. They're fled on horses, swift as are the Winds, And like the Winds do surely move in such Uncertain ways, as will beguile, and make Too vain the purpose of pursuit; but to Deter us more, her Virgin fame is of That tender quality, as must Not be invaded with designs of blood, And she esteems her Brother as her life. Dor. A Brother too, is my hearts enemy. I will not ask thy Mistress name, because My jealous wisdom by a vow, makes me Conceal hers, whom my love adores; but be It lawful to inquire the cause, why thy Affection not enjoys, whom it doth seem So highly to deserve? Orge. Her Brothers pride destroys my hopes; knowing My Fortune and my wealth, reach not my Birth. Dor. The very cause that makes me languish too, You pow'rs; why did you cruelly ordain Base treasure (trash to noble minds) should be Impediments to love? Or, why For humane quietness, are not our thoughts Proportion'd to our wealth? Orge. Our sorrows bear such simpathy, I must Require no less (as a requital of My story) then the relation Sir of yours. Dor. It is so like your own, that if you keep a Diary Of all your evil late doth act, you Hourly may read mine. But for Diversity, you shall be taught. Those Woods Have kept me mourning here, dismiss'd From Cordua, where my Mistress rules all Eyes; And banish'd thence by her command out of Ill chosen pity to preserve, whom it Unwillingly destroys. Orge. From Cordua! The very place too where my Mistress did reside. It is not fit Sir, further to enquire into A lovers secresie; but our calamities Appear so like, I needs must beg, to call you friend. Dor. It is a priviledge which I In mine own wishes found ere 'twas desir'd By you; for when our hearts and fortunes are So near ally'd, why should we separate Our hands? I hope my time of exile Is now expir'd; for I would fain Obscurely make a visit to the Town. Orge. Let us confirm our friendship with our vows, Then strait together move; my honor and My life, I will engage In every noble danger to assist your love. Dor. That vow devoutly seal'd, I will confirm, And still preserve in each design of yours. Orge. Our force united thus, w'are abler for Revenge, though not ordain'd for a redress; Then with some joy, we should remember too We have so much of luck, as to be young, And though our fortune's weak, our loves are strong. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Androlio, Claramante, Marillia. Androlio. You may be here as safe as in a Cloister; And (if your hard heart please) as innocent. This right rev'rend Matron governs the house, And will proportion all to your desires. Clar. She seems so vertuous Sir, I'll trust her with My life, and yet I shall confess, I do Not credit her enough. Andr. You may trust her With your life (Lady) for sh'ath kept her own Thus handsomely, about some threescore years. Maril. Threescore and ten next Whitson Eve though 'tcome To morrow, I assure you Sir. Andr. Shake off suspition from Your thoughts, and be so much resolv'd, as to Believe all I have promis'd, shall be Well perform'd. Clar. If I were faithfully Inform'd Don Orgemon is safe, I should Be easily taught to grow more hopeful of Mine own security. Andr. When I surpris'd you in The Wood, one of my disguis'd followers I left behind to watch his safety, and T'unbind him, when we had out-gone his sight: But he's return'd, and brings intelligence, A stranger, by prevention, gave him liberty, And he saw them both hasten to this Town. Clar. How could you cruelly design such griefs To those, who would not cause anothers pain, Although to cure their own? Andr. 'Twas a kind of wicked wantonness, A pretty sort of doing mischeif a Fine new way; th'old way of sinning is tedious. Besides, you know how much it doth concern The honor of a Cavalier, to be Out-witted where a Mistress is the prize. But be assur'd, all now is safe, and I As vertuous too, as you would wish. Clar. Hid you oblig'd Heaven yesterday with such Resolves of vertue, there had been no use Of fears or tears, which yield as little remedy. Andr. What ere I knew your name or quality, By this Light! it concern'd my hopes extreamly To take you for a small offender; which had You prov'd, 'tis ten to one I had prov'd so too. Maril. The Gentleman speaks well; for as they say We must conform our selves to all occasions. Andr. You are a she Philosopher, And know the Compounds of the World. Clar. I hope your resolution Sir, will not Forsake those better thoughts you entertain'd So hastily. Andr. I pray be confident! I'm grown so exquisitly mended, that I've lik'd my self these two long hours; So charitable, as I could e'en promise This good old woman a good turn, but that She will expect it, and her age! (I fear) Is hardly satisfied. Clar. Your words are still too doubtful Sir. Andr. Lady? Believe me I am vertuousâ Mother, is your young daughter at School yet? 'Tis time to leave her Needle now, and breed Her for the publick good. Maril, 'Las Sir, 'tis such A head-strong thing! But she will learn I hope. Andr. The time will not allow Much counsel now, haste, and confine your self Within your Chamber, your Brothers are abroad; They make as curious search, and with no less Authority, then the all licenc'd Sun. It were as much as death, if they should find You out? Away, I will adventure forth, And learn how their intelligence proceeds. Exeunt. Enter Leonte, Balthazar, Argilo, Gonsalvo. Leon. For th'honor of your reason (Balthazar) Let not your eyes betray you to a life Of lasting folly. Errors taken up In haste, and then as hastily dismiss'd, May be excus'd; but here t'inhabit, and Consider twenty hours, upon a Beauty (Found such a common way) must needs Appear both shameful and abhor'd. Gonsal. A face, which if unhappily you had Not ta'en the pains to find within, perhaps Would have been hung out of the Window for A sign of invitation. Arg. Faith do the poor soul right: For though she may be willing to betray, Yes I believe her years allow her not Capacity, she's yet scarce fit To be gather'd, her season is not come. Leon. 'Tis but our difference in judgment Sir: I think she is so ripe, that she will fall With the next touch. Balt. Enough! You shall subdue me Gentlemen, And make me vildly natur'd, to preserve The fame of my discretion: For I Will leave this Ladyâ Enter Amiana. Leon. Look there, she is prepar'd for parting Sir, Balthazar goes to her. I prethee do not stay to give good counsel, She is too fair to take it, strait follow us To th'Western Port, unless my Spies Prove double ey'd. This night (false sister) I Shall find your dark abode. Balthazar. Make hasteâ Exeunt Leonte, Gonsalvo, Argilo. Balt. Lady you see my services (disdain'd By you) are so much valued by my friends, They would not have me lose them here. Your own Unkindness will provoke me to a rude Severity, I must leave you! Leave you For ever! But have left such power within, As shall enable you still to command The house. Fortune and Love protect your hopes! Exit Balthazar. Amia. Perfect my understanding Love, and I Release my hopes. What mean these seeming Saints? These false Usurpers of Celestial shapes? Why do they wear their Tongues So long a journey from their Hearts, that yet Their words and thoughts, could never meet? What is the hidden sence of their desires? They all complain I am not kind; yet still I grant them tears, and sighs, and prayers. Then search The very utmost confines of my Brest, Until I find out worthy wishes to Requite those courtesies they call their Love; Yet still they say I am not kind. Enter Orco, and a third Servant. 3 Serv. Those strangers Sir, that came in visit to her, Descended through the Tarras to the Street. Please you to enter, for the Chambers free. Orco. Be mindful of my first commands. Exit Servant. Amia. Hath th'evil spirit got your shape again? My cheif Betrayer, whether shall I flie? Orco. Lady! Y'are ev'ry where secure: You have Not guilt enough to know, or fear a danger. Amia. What make you here? Orco. If there be truth in man, I have been vigilant to find you out, With meer design to serve you faithfully. Amia. I! you are all in feign'd resemblance kind; True Votaries of love without. Such, false Androlio shew'd at first, so you appear'd: And such Don Balthazar, all true alike. Seeming to render, and devote your selves With less design, then infants. Your faces seem'd in Heaven, your hearts Were bred in Hell. Orco. In some hot Region sure; for I Confess we are most firely addicted. Amia. Not one of all your promissing pretending Sex, Is vertuously inclin'd. Orco. 'Faith, hardly Lady. Yes, I've a Grand-father! Who since he was Last bedrid, is pretty honest; and I believe Th'old Anchoret that sojourns yonder in The Abbey Wall, is a little mortifi'd, Since he lost his feeling. Amia. O, how deceiving are those Tragick tales; Those mourning Histories of Love, which in The dreadful Winter nights, our innocent Maids Are us'd to read, whilst we are couzen'd of Our tears, weeping for joy, when loyal Natures seem From hazard freed, and then for grief of their Distress: Yet now I see such Characters Of Honor, ne'er had real being here. Orco. 'Lass! These are Poets snares to catch Young lovers in. Madam, you see how freely I confess; Which is some note I am reclaim'd. Amia. I gladly would believe you Sir; and it Doth much concern your happiness, still to Maintain my growing Faith, with worthy Deeds. Orco. Hear me! And that your Eye may first prepare Your Ear; Behold me on my Knee, to make My protestations sacred by a Vow, if you Will scape your Fathers wrath (who by his Spies, Pursues you every where,) follow where I Shall bring you, to enjoy all that your vertue can Desire. But time doth force us to such strict Necessity of haste, as will admit No arguing, or pause. Amia. Indanger'd by my Father too! Lead on, If thou prov'st false again, I shall Disclaim my Patience, and convert My gentle Mercy to a raging Curse. Orco. She hath such pretty twinckling Eyes, Stars in A frosty night, are nothing to 'em. I have once more a kind of secret grudging To turn Traytor. Exeunt. Enter Balthazar at one door, Gonsalvo and Argilo at the other. Gonsal. Don Balthazar! Balt. You judge well in the dark. I am No worse a man; be you (Gonsalvo) more Sparing of your good looks: Shrink in your Cloak Awhile. I guess it by The flutt'ring up and down of your night fowl, Something of Rapine or Revenge is near. Arg. Upon my life, your Brother's cudgellers They watch about Androlio's house. Balt. Where have you left my Brother? Gonsal. Where hath his Brain left him, and he left us? Arg. To night he hath been long in whisper with Androlio's man; who hath betray'd to him His Masters small secrets, and in pursuit Of some design deriv'd from that intelligence, Is gone alone. Balt. What he determines in His rash resolves, I'll not be guilty of: I guess my sister in the hands of Orgemon, And therefore safe; for though not spaciously Possess'd of Lands, his Honor, and his Fame, May equal any Mans, that bears his fortune At the highest rate. Let us retire home. Exeunt. Enter Dorando, Orgemon, a little disguis'd, and one Servant. 1 Serv. Sir, credit my instructions. 'Twas not Leonte, but Androlio, that Surpris'd you in the Wood. His man (newly Revolted from him) gave me this for truth. Orge. His wantonness and vain luxurious wit, Hath made him false; he will not find That I can trifle with Reverge, as he with Friendship. Dor. If you are sure he is not sound at heart, Then let him blood: Why should these managers Of mischeif, dwell i'th'light? The Grave is dark, And fit for secresie, dispatch him thither. Orge. I am attended on by several Scouts, But I shall take Dorando as The readiest test of love, if you will go And privately invite Him to me with his Sword; that house which fronts Upon Jago's Church, is (as my Man Informs me) th'onely place to which he doth Design his visits. Much about this hour, He is accustom'd to begin his walk; If you will watch near to the corner there, You may encounter him. Dor. Him, and the house I know; he shall consent To come and satisfie these idle injuries, Or I will force him to a shame, Less pleasing then your wrath. Orge. I cannot doubt his courage, 'tis his crime; His Sword is never unprepar'd, nor hath He temper how to chuse his enterprise: I'll stand in the adjoyning Street, And closly there attend your coming Sir. Dor. Be muffled in your Cloak: Although the night be some protection to you; Yet I observe men passing by, begin To gaze, and pierce you with their eyes. Orge. My own suspitions have prevented your Advice. Andrea, make you haste unto My house, and there prepare for our return. Exeunt several ways. Enter Androlio and Marillia. Andr. I prethee (Dear Antiquity) this is No time to waste in Lectures. Where is the Lady? Maril. Why, what's the matter Sir? You are perhaps in very exceeding Extraordinary haste to be wicked, are you? Andr. Will you sit still and warm your self at your Whole house, burnt to a coal, and then be broyl'd Like a Rasher on't. Maril. By whom? My house (Sir) is an honest house, I care not who knows it. Androl. The greater shame for you. T'were more manners to be like the rest of Your Neighbors. Where is the Lady? That slave My man (bred in a Galley, and begot Between Wind and Water) is turn'd rebel. Where is the Lady? Maril. There is your Lady Sir! How do you hide Your looks, as if your eyes were none of your own? Enter Amiana, and Orco following. Andr. Amiana! None but that Arch-Magician Orco, Could make this sudden Metamorphosis. That devil Orco haunts me every where; I must learn to say my prayers, that I may Be rid of him. Amia. Sir, I have found you now, And I will keep you too: For since you are Not wone with sorrows, I will try to scorn The cause, and make (as you have done) strange mirth Of all my miseries. Pray how have you profited In your long travels after Women-kind? Orco. Is your Commission seal'd yet to Monopolize Black eyes? Me thinks by this your plenteous store Should make you under-value them. Amia. Can your old juggling conscience finde the trick, (Androlio) when we meet, t'expose me to The charge of blushing for us both. Andr. Amiana! For thy part, Heaven is my Judge, I do forgive thee heartily; though it Was far from my intent, that we should meet At midnight in this wicked house. Maril. How! A wicked house? Bating this worthy Gentlewoman: I defie thee, say thy worst Andr. Come, come, I have known you Since I was a foot high. You would have seduc'd me then, My Nurse can witness it. Maril. Your Nurse! Sir, I defie her too. Bring her To her Book oath! Orco. Nay, Marillia, remember Patience is one of the Seven deadly Vertues! Will you stake your young Wit, to the old Brains Of a dry Nurse? Maril. Madam! If ever I had a mind to his Lordship in his Cradleâ Andr. Orco, Y'have us'd me very tenderly. I'faith let me bear the charge of your Spies. What did it cost to find me out? I'll pay't. Orco. No Sir. It shall not need, I'll put The Advocates Daughter into th'accompt, And sum up all together. Andr. Canst thou believe (If there be so much good Steel in all Europe, As will make a Point to a Bodkin) that Thou canst live two hours? Thou! who art so great A Traytor, thou wouldst e'en betray thy self, But that the Treason is not worth the paying for. Orco. Canst thou believe? Canst thou (I say) believe, that all thy vows to this Poor Lady, being broken, would not weigh Thy guilty friendship down, till thou fall'd lower Then a Plummet, that is threescore years a sinking. Andr. Are you at that Ward Sir? Amiana come I Though you affect to keep ill hours, 'tis not My use to be abroad so late. Amia. I'le stand accomptant for this error (Sir), So you will answer for your cancel'd vows To morrow to the Priest. Andr. 'Tis like I shall be found discreet: I may consider with My self, before I give my self away. Orco. Androlio marriage is a kind of foolish Pennance, we Are often put unto, for wasting thus Our precious time, in making silly love. Andr. Age! Aches! And incessant Jealousie, Scorn'd Poverty, and powerless Lust be thine But for all these Curses (Orco) I will Not leave you here. There is a certain Lady in The house, which I will sacrifice ere you shall stay to enjoy. Orco. I will go with you Sir, for Amiana's sake, For as my weak advis'd capacity Doth guess, there are a soft of mighty Laborers Attend about your house, plac'd by Leonte as 'Tis thought; but are her kinreds Bravo's, who Do long to greet your Shoulders for her sake. Amia. Sir, if you'll perfect what you have begun, Add to your Honor by assisting us I'th' passage home. Androlio pulls his Sword out of's Belt. Orco. O! Does your loftiness Begin to consider, Lady? Let not the thought of danger trouble you, For I'll convey you backward through a Gate That safely leads unto a dwelling of mine own. Take care (Marillia) of your charge within, Lock all your doors; I'll return with the first Sun. Maril. If there be Law in Spain, his Nurse shall know it. Exeunt. Enter Leonte, and second Servant. Leon. Make here a stop? Will thy false Keys procure Us entrance every where? 2 Serv. From the Childes Cabinet, To the great Gate, this Bunch will open all. Leon. Ha'ye brought the Bravo hither, which you hir'd I'th' street, t'assist us, if our use require him. 2 Serv. He waits your purposes in the next room. Those that you heard descending from the Postern by The Garden Wall, was sure my Master and His friends, newly departed homeward from Their visit here. Leon. Then we have no impediment, But that decrepid grave Iniquity That keeps the house. Steal down to intercept Her as she now returns from the back Gate, And force her to keep silence in some Vault, And let the Bravo wait without; for though Not here, I may have use of him when I return. 2 Serv. I shall dispatch all your commands. Exit 2 Servant. He steps to the Arras softly, draws it. Claramante is discovered sleeping on her Book, her Glass by. Leon. Her Glass and Book! The Mirrors that Reflect her Face and Mind! But what commerce Hath solemn Piety, with Beauties vain, False aids; and yet she sleeps, as if her Minds Most healthful Innocence, had never been Misled by the bewitching Treasons of Her face, a sign (perhaps) her Conscience is Already dead, and hath no sence of what She acts. Wake thou, who's sleeps a Lethargy, Thy Souls disease, not her repose. Clar. Ha! My Brother! Leon. Thy fate! Read on my angry Brow, What shortly thou shalt find thy treach'rous Stars Will tell thee, scornfully was their Decree, If thy guilt loaden Soul, be doom'd to clime. Clar. My fears are not deriv'd from mine own sins, But a distrust of yours. I wish your fury would Permit you to be half so innocent, As I have been. Leon. Thus to revolt and flie From all your honor'd Blood and Family, Tempted by Lust to hunt And retrieve your lost game, prostrating your Fame to every one, that will beget A scandal on it, to disgrace our noble House. D'ye call this Innocence? Clar. Whither will you lead me? Leon. Unto a shade that will not need to borrow Blackness nor Silence from the Night, there give Thee unto such as shall inforce thee to Thy Prayers betimes, least thou forget their use. Clar. I will not go, for though my vertue dares Proceed to every danger, yet thy sins Divert my courage. Leon. Shall we make trial of our strengths? Clar. Help! Help! Is there no pitious ear within The reach of my complaining voice? Enter Dorando. Dor. If pity can Assume such new and wondrous pow'r to give A remedy to grieve, take it from me; and must Resent all injuries to her soft sex. Leon. You, Bravo! Slave! Wer't thou not newly hir'd I'th' Street, and for the common price of blood To serve my anger, or expose thy life For my revenge. Retire! Begone, till my Necessity command thy help. Dorando pulls of his Patches, and disguise. Dor. So cheap an Instrument of cruelty I seem'd in my disguise, t'a stist a friends Revenge; but if thou hast the Patience to Peruse my face, thou may'st believe me made For nobler use, then to make sale Of courage, or my strength. Clar. Don Dorando! He, to whose timely valor My Brother Balthazar doth ow his life! How art thou laid aside by Heaven as a Reserve, to hinder every great calamity? Dor. Claramante! Let me adore these weak, These narrow artificial Lights, that shew Me now, what I believ'd the Sun could ne'er Present unto my view, with all his glorious Beams. Leon. You are acquainted, I shall betray My self into the pretty private vice Of bringing Lovers to converse, That would not take the pains to find themselves. Dor. How strangely are the pow'rs above employ'd, That they should seem so negligent to leave You in distress. Leon. Let but my eyes make use Of my vex'd memory, and I shall find You are that mighty Man of Rage, who in The rescue of this righteous Ladies honor, Controul'd me in my house, where you A stranger, and the place consider'd, I Was well contented you should live. Dor. Prethee, wild thing, do not remove my thoughts From this unequal'd object they enjoy, With Meditations on thy idle History. Begone! Vanish like a poor frighted spirit From the bright day's predominance: Or would Thou wert a spirit, that when thou dost offend, I might not have the power to kill or hurt thee. Leon. Though I should tempt the World, and vex into A fury, all the race of mankind, one By one, I should not find a mightier Mind that doth So Monarch like, both threaten and command. I am so pleas'd with thy great anger, as I needs Must put it to some use, Least I should never meet the like t'incounter me. Draws. Clar. O hold! Must I become the lasting argument For such disputes of ruine, and of death? Dor. Retire! She that is fairer, much more kind, And wiser then thy Stars, doth counsel thee. Leon. Advis'd to yield, before I am subdu'd. Runs at him, they fight; Dorando disarms him. Dor. Why would you trouble me, t'undo you thus? Clar. Why Brother will you let your rash suspition, Betray you to continual loss? This is The second time you have engag'd my tears, For ransome of your life, with hazard of Mine own, upon my knees I shall implore To have your safety, and your Sword restor'd. With hope, if you adventure both again, My life may satisfie my pities crime Kneels. Dor. It is too mean a suit, to be so much requir'd. Dorando restores his Sword Leon. How hath my jealous sence seduc'd me to My shame? Her Mercy twice hath rescu'd me? Is this the bounty of thy Soul, Not tainted with the artful cunning of Pretended love? Clar. What false perswasions govern you, That you should doubt thus my Integrity? Leon. No more. I'll practise to disdain my self; All that is kind and good, protect you both. Clar. Sir, whether in this hideous season of The night, have you design'd to go? Leon. Let me depart! If I should stay, you are Undone. A knot of cruel slaves (whom my Mistaken Fury hir'd to murder you, When I convey'd you through the street) will, if My presence and command, prevent not their Design, ruine your passage hence, or force This house to find you. My stay is fatal! Exit. Dor. Madam, you seem to entertain some thoughts About you, whose disorders will require Advice. Can you be kept in aw with the False noise of mischief, or a tale of death, Whilst I am living here, and still My valors fire, may be renew'd at your Inspiring Beauties flame? Clar. Alass! The debts I ow your valor (Sir) I find so great Already, I am loath to entertain Another cause, to make me more oblig'd, Until I find 'tis in my power to pay. Dor. Are not your words? are not your looks, rewards For ev'ry mighty deed? That the renown'd And fortunate, shall bravely mannage in Obedience to your will. Clar. My heart is overwhelm'd with courtesies, and I Am studying how this strange unlucky surfeit, may Be cur'd, without a fast from kindness and Your love. Dor. An abstinence from my pure love! High Heaven avert so strange a sickness, that Requires such cruelty to aid the cure! Enter Orgemon. Clar. Don Orgemon! The Fates are wise; they know To value Blessings, and observe just order in Their gifts, the greatest comes at last. What happy miracle hath brought you hither? Orge. Waiting i'th' street, in this disguise, I heard And knew your Brothers voice, who lowd to men (For bloody purposes disguis'd) give them The story of a fierce, but fortunate Encounter here; for he declar'd his heart Was reconcil'd to yours, and by a stern Command, is now dismissing them from their Affair. This Joy did give me wings, That I might quickly share your happiness. Clar. My happiness doth so exceed, that you May share it Sir, yet leave enough To fill my Brest. Orge. This night alone, I will Adorn, and sanctifie i'th' Kallander. Goes to Dorando. My worthy friend, your valor may proclaim It self the cause of our Felicity, What new occasion doth disturb your looks? Dor. Are you so well acquainted with that Lady? And have the priviledge to be so kind. Orge. How else should I subsist? 'Tis not the vulgar cause Of mens existency (a mixture of The common Elements) by which I live, But by the nourishment of her pure love. Dor. Oh Niggard-fates! How ill Did you provide for me? Those giddy wanderers I'th' air, or cold and slippery Creatures that Possess the restless Flood, sustain Their lives with no less choice, then is decreed For me, yet neither know your pow'rs, nor own Your benefits with thankful praise. Orge. What means my valiant friend? Dor. Sir, you enjoy a strange Felicity? You are belov'd, and would I knew it not, Unless my knowledge could be satisfi'd With equal hope. Orge. Forbid this dangerous envy, you that rule Our thoughts. Am I so slow to merit what You give? That one, whom you have newly made My friend, should mourn to see my happiness. Clar. When will my sad distresses end? My days Are chosen from the Moneth, when April rules Each shining hour is followed by a storm. Orge. Call to your vertue for advice (brave friend) And do not seem to show your sorrows ere You know what I enjoy, is not deserv'd. Dor. If love can merit love? or, if incessant grief And fears, be marks and trials of that love? Let beauteous Claramante hold the Scale, She'll find my heart, out-weighs all other hearts, Till they seem lighter then inconstant thought. Orge. Take heed, 'tis dangerous to deprave my Passion, Sir, By valuing your own. Dor. If there be danger, take You heed t'avoid it then? For in the Worlds Vaste space, nothing that knows the light, dares more Avouch his love, than I. Orge. With what a rash, And unconsider'd haste, was our new friendship made, That it can last no longer? Dor. It is already grown too old and wearisome, As sickly life preserv'd with pain. Clar. Oh Orgemon! Let not my yielded love Become thy valors prize; or why must Don Dorando's worth, since it exceeds all others, not Be safe, 'cause it would bravely equal thine. Orge. He shall have all your pity, and some little love, So you will stay the progress of your fears. Think not we will be cruel to our selves, Least you vouchsafe to judge that cruelty To you: We both are calm, and will conduct You safely to your Brother Balthazar. Salutes Dorando. Clar. As this soft gentle temper pleases Heaven, So be it still delightful to your selves. Orgemon takes Dorando aside. Orge. The early morn shall see your anger satisfi'd, Till then keep your vex'd spirits in, and hide Your fury from her sight. It were not noble to Disquiet her, whom you so fervently Pretend to love. Dor. That were so wild an incivility, as soon Would forfeit either Victors fame: But hast Thou bright perpetual traveller, and bring Thy beams betimes t'inlighten us, and then We'll try the strength of both our fates. Orge. He may a while rejoyce to observe his fires So powerful in our blood; but when he sees How high our anger grows, he will retire, Withdraw behind black gather'd Clouds to mourn, He shall not find us at his next return. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCENE I. Knocking at the Door. Enter Androlio, dressing himself. Androlio. The World is grown so wicked, their sins (sure) Will never suffer 'em to sleep. Knock within. Knocking again, Androlio opens the Door. Enter Balthazar. Balt. Save you Sir. Andr. Your hast would signifie you bring Some promise to that purpose (Sir,) Came you From Heaven just now with tidings of Eternity? Balt. If I came post from Heaven, it is thought Sir I should hardly light at your Gates; d'you hear This morn ought that concerns Don Orgemon, And his strange friend? Or know you where they are? Andr. I keep no Lodgings Sir? The Rent of this Poor House, I make shift to pay without Inmates. Balt. O, I understand you! The morning that Should make others serious, is grown your time Of mirth. If you please, good morrow! Exit Balthazar. Andr. I'm highly satisfi'd! This Town, I think, is peopled with Knights Errant, 'Tis every hour so full of strange adventures. Knock again. Is there another come with new authority To ask impertinent questions? He opens the Door. Enter Leonte. Your furious temper brooks no idle circumstance, You shall be satisfi'd before you ask. Your Brother is not here, we parted Newly at the other door. Leon. My business seeks not him. Are you so lucky t'understand where I May find Dorando, or Don Orgemon? Andr. I've neither Sir the luck, nor the desire, Unless I knew to put the knowledge of it To some good use. Leon. It will become you to Inquire abroad, until you can know more. Exit. Andr. What may this eager disquisition mean? Something of moments in't. I'm a dull rogue, To sleep away my time, when I might share The huge pleasure of doing little mischiefs. Enter Orco, Amiana. Orco. Don Androlio! So early up! Studying (I hope) to put your Money out To charitable uses. Andr. 'Faith that will hardly be, Till your diseases (Orco) drive you to An Hospital, I would thou hadst as many As might destroy an over-grown City, The Turks grand Army, or a Wind-bound Fleet; You thrive like other Traitors in this age, And signifie your greatness, by entring every where Without the mean civility of knocking. Orco. I bring my powerful Charter in my hand; Abhor me, if thy Mistress be not grown A desperate Wit. And since the last Digestion of her grief, she fools prettily. Andr. She'll fool me prettily indeed, if this Old toy of Matrimony hold: Are you grown a wit Amiana? Amia. I shall be thought so, Sir, When I have reach'd capacity enough To make you vertuous. Andr. Nay, y'are a wit. I find it by the great variety Of Posies which you sent this morn for Wedings Rings. Amia. As subtle, and as wise a spirit as You are, those silly charms are likely to Prove strong enough, to keep you long, and fast, I'th' circle of mine arms, when once the Priest Shall conjure you. Orco. Those Vows (Androlio) which we make At midnight, should (In my opinion) not prove good i'th' Common Law, Wer't not for that wanton Worm (thy Conscience) Which still lies wriggling up and down thy Brest, Thou might'st be well excus'd, consid'ring too The easiness, and rawness of thy youth. Andr. E'en as she please: For my part Sir, I will Deal plainly with her like an honest man; Which is, to tell her, being marry'd, I Shall prove a very Rogue. Orco. I think thou wilt, Unless her better Grace preserve thee. Andr. I shall often put you (Amiana) to Your mornings draught of Tears; and to Your meal of Sighs, on fasting Nights, which will (I guess) be every night, according to My usual strict severity of life. Amia. I will take order then, that you shall sigh For company. Orco. Which with a mutual groan or two, will make Rare Musick. When her Treble's joyn'd unto Your Base, together with the Cradle Concordance Of three small Organists (I mean) your children. Andr. Orco, where's Claramante now? Orco. The Palsie shake your Tongue out, wer't not to make Your Mistress jealous, I could ask't of you. Andr. Is not your stock of fooling spent? Orco. I've yet so much discretion left, to judge It was by your appointment, that your man Inclos'd Marillia in a Vault, whilst some Of your confed'racy remov'd the Lady. Andr. Prethee, be grave, it may bring truth to be A while in fashion. Art thou in earnest? Orco. Dost thou ask sadly? Andr. Else let me die surpris'd. Orco. And let me die in a Dungeon, if I had Not thought to find her here: For gone she is, Whilst the poor old Woman was led aside, By that no ordinary Devil, your man. Andr. Exquisit Villain! I forgive him all, Would he had practis'd to have cut my Throat, That I might forgive that too. Enter Third Servant. 3 Serv. Don Basilonte (Sir) inrag'd without, Demands to speak with you. Amia. How, my Father! Andr. Will your vex'd Virginship Vouchsafe to stay here, till you be well swadled. Amia. Let me retire: Androlio, if you dare Be cruel, I shall dare to pardon you. Exit. Andr. Go, give him entrance. Exit 3 Servant. Enter Basilonte. Basil. Are you Don Androlio? Andr. Not unless you please Sir. Basil. 'Tis well you are so mannerly; but 'twere Better you'd be honest. Where is my Daughter? Andr. Sir, I perceive you purpose Brevity. Orco. The Gentleman's in haste; 'tis like he is A kinn unto his Daughter, your answer May concern him. Basil. What are you Sir? Orco. Not your Daughter Sir, therefore that question B'ing no part of your business, was ill made. Basil. I hope you'll both fight? Andr. How! fight? The Laws are not so valiant Sir, They will admit no fighting. Basil. I care not for the Laws. Andr. Be like then you have made over your estate. Basil. Why, would the Lawyers have it else? Andr. Troth, if your Lands be fair, 'tis like they'll not Forbear 'em out of modesty. Basil. Sir, these are tricks: Give me my Daughter: I thought she would have fled into a Nunnery, But this (I hear) is none. Orco. Who ever told you so, was in the right, Unless there are a sort of Nuns with Beards. Basil. Will you both walk? I'm an old Man, although My wit's not sharp, you'll find my Iron is? Andr. Orco, You know my way is two to two, And this old Trojan's Mode (as I conceive) Is one to both, we shall hardly agree. Basil. I find we sha' not. Will you walk? Andr. This cholerick Biscayner, takes me more then A Wench. Sir stay a while, the business that We go about, is not so trivial, but It may conveniently require The interchanging of a word, especially When we consider our discourses after death, Are but uncertain. Basil. Dispatch then, I'm in haste. Andr. Do you conceive, you have deriv'd this Mettal To your Daughter; and she (as far as her Part lies) can with anothers help Derive it to a Son? Basil. Sir, you shall know my Daughter wants to Mettal. Andr. Then you must know she shall not be restor'd. Basil. Why not restor'd? Andr. May be, I've some occasion to marry her. Orco. In my judgment, a satisfying reason. Basil. But not Sir without my consent. Andr. I'm partly of your mind, for (as I hear) Your consent may do well, y'are very rich. Basil. So are you I hope. Andr. Nay if we fall To good wishes, 'tis like we may agree? Enter Argilo and Gonsalvo. Arg. Pray Gentlemen can any here instruct Us where to find Don Orgemon, or Don Dorando. Gonsal. Th'intelligence, if suddenly attain'd May by the use, procure a gen'ral thanks. Basil. Orgemon and Dorando! Why d'you ask So earnestly, and with such haste? Andr. 'Tis I'm concern'd in your inquiry Gentlemen: For now it seems it argues danger. Orco. And I am concern'd too; what is the business? Arg. 'Tis certain they are missing, and are gone By probable mistrust to fight. Gonsal. Th'occasion of their quarrel's partly known, And they were early seen both hors'd and arm'd. Basil. Whether did they ride? Arg. Nay Sir, that question is our business here. Gonsal. We thought Don Orco and Androlio, b'ing Their friends, might guess, to what fit place Their anger would direct them. Basil. Th'are gallant youths. I would not for the treasure of Castile, have either's life indanger'd in A foolish cause. Andr. How can their danger Sir, In so particular a sense belong to you? Basil. No matter: Y'are troublesome, My horse, my horse! I shall return Sir in a short career, Take an accompt of my Daughter, or call You out to this mad sport. Exit. Andr. I am inclin'd unto this reverend Cavalier, Beyond all latitude of words, but if Don Orgemon is grown so much Impatient of slight things, cal'd Injuries, His next hot bout must be with me. Orco. Prethee let's hasten to prevent this Duel. Andr. I fear it is too late; but I'll commit My Mistress to th'protection of this Key, And then to horse. Orco. Come Senniors, his Stable will provide us all. Exeunt. Enter Claramante and Orgemon. Clar. Oh my Prophetick tears, why are thy looks So wild, so busily dispers'd? as if (In vain) thou sought'st for safety after guilt? Orge. Why (Claramante) dost thou frown upon My triumphs, as if now, I were less worth In victory, then in my doubtful state Of fortune ere 'twas try'd; when it was possible I might be lessen'd and subdu'd? Clar. Whom hast thou conquer'd (fatal Orgemon?) That thou shouldst wear those bloody stains with so Much pride, as if the World did newly ow Its freedom to thy valors force. Orge. Mine enemy, one that advanc'd his love To ruine mine. Rivals for hearts, are like Competitors for Crowns; they will allow No equal, nor admit him living that Disturbs their hopes. Clar. Thy jealous Honor, is Most viciously, and cruelly inclin'd. Couldst thou not think thy love was safe, without The ruine of Dorando that preserv'd The life of Balthazar, did rescue mine. Gave rash Leonte leave to live, and thee Thy freedom, when thou wer't surpris'd and bound. Orge. These were indeed acts of renown, nor can My Envy ere mislead my Vertue, till It give them but a cheap esteem, I wish His honor had been greater, so he could Have had less love. Clar. Alass! was love his crime? And love of me? I find thy heart was cast, And fashion'd in the common Lovers Mould, Poorly compounded of malicious fears, Of rash low jealousies, hating That noble Vertue in another, which Thou highly valued st in thyself. Orge. This wisdom and compassion comes too late. Would I had lost my youthful being, and My precious Fame; all that I value (but Thy love) so I could call him back from those Unknown, or distant shades, that he might see The Sun, and thee again. Clar. O that some winged Messenger, Would quickly travel through the Clouds, and fetch Me all my vows from Heaven; that so my faith When dis-engag'd, might give a needful liberty Unto my love; why should it longer be confin'd To harbor in thy Brest, since there 'twas entertain'd With such uncivil jealousie. Orge. I shall become a sad exemplar Sacrifice T'instruct, and expiate the World, and die To cure the folly of succeeding Lovers doubts. Clar. Unfortunate Dorando, is the cold Dark Grave, all the reward my Luckless Stars Could pay thee for thy mercy to my Brothers shewn, And kind protection of my life. Going out. Orge. Stay Claramante! Stay! If thou Dost carry hence thy injur'd love, and leave Me unforgiven, oppress'd, and loaden with The weight of guilt, I will at once shake off This burden of mortality, and it. Clar. Although my sudden kindness may appear A sin, I cannot leave thee to The danger of such cruel thoughts: Take heed How you do threaten Heaven, by menacing Your self; as we have no authority To take away the being of another, whom Our pride contemns, so we have less t'annihilate Our own, when it is faln in our dislike. Orge. Is it thy pleasure I should live? And am I call'd to't by Love, and may believe I have some little warrant to authorise Hope. Enter Balthazar. Balt. Where is Don Orgemon? Sister I see In fears, and grief, you both have equal share, But I shall timely ease your suff'rings. Dorando wasted with his Wounds, a while Assum'd the cold Aspect of Death; but rub'd And chaff'd into his native heat, his strength And understanding are in some degree Of safety home return'd; nor are his wounds So plac'd, but that the Surgeon may allow Them sudden hope of cure. Orge. Thou blessed Messenger of Life! Be ever happy, and thy voice be still The forward usher unto good, and noble fame: Live to be cheif in Armies, and the first That brings thy doubtful Countrey news of Victory. Clar. Best of my Blood! Thy comforts Balthazar Are still as swift and winged when they come, As thou art slow to carry sorrows to thy friends. Orge. Now (Claramante) let me not distrust Thy pardon may increase, since my offence Seems to grow less; and let the mercy of Thy love, give strength, and form unto My yet imperfect joys. Clar. If in thy last Encounter thou hadst lost much blood, I should Forgive thy want of blushes for this rash Request; but having such supplies of colour left To make up seeming bashfulness, where is That red, and modest tincture which belongs Unto thy brow, and should appear when thou So soon dost ask me for my love, So lately forfeited by jealousie. Orge. I yield, and humbly bow unto my fate; Yet since there's to confession some forgiveness due, Afford me that, though my desires: By beauteous Claramante are deny'd. Clar. Bear witness World, with what unwillingness I now am just, and ere thou hear'st thy doom, Know brave Dorando's merits, and My ever injur'd Sex, could not with less Be satisfied. Orge. Be slow to utter it, Unless thou canst be gentle when thou speak'st. Clar. My resolution is become my vow. Thou never shalt behold me more, to make A rightful challenge of my love, till he Who thus hath suffer'd for thy jealousie, Is pleas'd t'intreat, and woo in thy behalf. Exit. Orge. Severe sad destiny! The worst of all My Stars ordain'd this Sentence ere 'twas spoke. Takes Balthazar aside. You (Sir) have powerful interest In Claramantes Brest, be pleas'd to mediate for me. Balt. If I have power. Where Don Dorando's chaste affection lays A claim, his noble rescue of my life, Must urge my gratitude to speak for him. Enter Leonte, Dorando, Argilo, and Gonsalvo, leading him. Leon. Sir be assur'd y'are hither brought for readiness, And more assistance to your cure; this house Hath nothing rich or useful in't, but what Shall wait on your command. Dor. I fear your beauteous sister governs here, Whom in my wretched fate, and loss of victory, I am asham'd to see. It must be so, Behold my enemy hither arriv'd, To claim a triumph for his single war! Balt. Quiet your passion Sir: The joy he takes In the unlucky honor of this day, Is so ecclips'd by clouds of following griefs, That you'll perceive he's more prepar'd for Funeral, Then for triumphal shows. Orge. You Sir, whose vertue makes the upper influence Of no regard nor use, born, and preserv'd Without protection of a Star; yet by Your unassisted worth, become the most Important envy now, of all within The Firmament, whose fortune was too weak, Too much unworthy to be stil'd your friend; And mine so treacherously strong, it hath Betray'd and forc'd me to be call'd your enemy. To you I beg for mercy. Dor. To me! Was I so easily subdu'd, That I deserve to be your scorn? Orge. Then let me want a Tongue to make requests, When I have cheifest need of Heaven. My Mourning is So little feign'd, that know, my soul disclaims The victory, and doth already curse The fury of the cause. Dor. I cannot set my understanding right Enough, to guess the meaning of this alteration. Orge. 'Tis strange indeed! Strange, that we both should be Ordain'd to love alike, and make One noble object our delight! But stranger yet That I by jealous fears; should vex my self Into a sad destruction of my love. Dor. Mislead me not to wander thus amazedly, When there's a nearer way to what Your language would infer. Orge. Resign your hopes to me, who first had priviledge To make a claim, then let your kindness prove As much a miracle, as it is just, By interceding for my love. Dor. If this be less then scorn, yet it is more Then vanity? Is't possible I should Resign my love, and be so dull to live. Know Sir, I have vouchsaf'd thus to continue life, In hope to have a second trial for This high, ill manag'd cause, already (sure) I find my strength doth hasten on my hope. Orge. Then my dispair out travels both: Had I The hand and seal of destiny, to warrant me To be again a victor over him, Though by that conquest I could gather all Those Wreaths, that ere the valiant wore Of old, then strait anticipate, and quite Forestal all future fame; yet would I not Resist him with my sword. Gons. These double expectations needs must have A sad event. Arg. It comes not in my reach, How Claramante should by either be Possess'd, and both be satisfied. Enter Basilonte, Orco. Basil. 'Tis well you took your wound so luckily. This steels a stubborn morsel to digest, If it enter the stomach the wrong way; Though there be no great use o'th' Surgeons mystery, Give him Two hundred Crowns. Orco. But where's the money Sir? Basil. Do you disburse? Orco. A mad old blade! Considering too, His wealth and eminence. Basil. I will allow you too, Whilst you are young, to cut some few throats fairly For honors sake; so they be strangers throats, But not your own; I have a reason for't. Will you take the pains to know me? Dor. We'are well acquainted with your fame already; Which is so good, we may for once excuse So rude an interruption of affairs; in which Y'are nought concern'd. Basil. How, not concern'd? Look on these Bills, And you on these; they will prove Receipts for Money, and large sums too, I think? They peruse the Papers, (Orco looking over their shoulders. Orco. By this Light they are! I know them by their Short stile, th'are pen'd the old Laconick way. Dor. Sir, I acknowledge this my hand, and that In travel I've receiv'd a long Supply; but much admire how these should come In your possession. Basil. Well Sir! And what say you? Orge. I make the same confession, but with show Of no less wonder then doth busie him. Basil. Confession pays no debts, but what are due To pious Scriv'ners that are gone to Heaven: And since your infancy's you have receiv'd By Letters of Exchange from Genoua, enough To furnish your imagin'd quality; for you'll Vouchsafe to think your selves but strangers here. Orge. This growing story may resolve my doubts. Basil. Know you his Character, whose credit gave You power to call for these supplies. Dor. Most perfectly. Orge. And 'tis to me familiar as mine own. Basil. This then (directed to you both) peruse. Orge, takes the Letter and reads. Orge. reads. Don Orgemon and Dorando, having call'd you from distant Countreys, to sojourn this Spring in Cordua; You are now to know, you should equally affect these names, for you are Brothers. They gaze one on another. Basil. Nay 'tis a dull Marchants stile; but read on. Orge. reads. Your Bills of Credit will succeed no longer then this Moneth; therefore apply your selves to him, whose Steward I have onely been to prevent your wants: Who (your Mother dying young) was resolv'd, out of a new Philosophical, and (as I may call it) Romance humor, not to declare himself your Father, till after you had visited several Camps, and Courts, he found your knowledge and vertue, merited the reputation of his Blood. Gaze on each other again. Orco. This is an old trick of Moorish Education, Just thus Aben Abdala bred his Sons. Orge. reads. Meaning you should have no certain expectations of Hereditary wealth, to interrupt the better acquirements of your Industry; but I have sent him the story of your lives, and he is well pleas'd to be now known your Father, whose name is Don Basilonte. Basil. What are you tender of your plenteous persons? Loath to be own'd? He that hath Fifty thousand Crowns A year, needs take no pains to find out heirs. Orco. Sir, you shall be my Father, if you please. Orge. Where joy hath such a share of wonder in't, Our pleasure is a while delay'd with doubts. Dor. It was too strange, and great a happiness To be too suddenly believ'd. Leon. Sir, w'have long heard you had two Sons, and from Their Childhood bred in distant parts; yet we Admire your humor could so much subdue Your nature, never to converse with them, Unless by your intelligence from others: But what we humor call, perhaps you'll term Discretion. Basil. May be I shall, what then? Had your Father Sir, And other formal Nobles bred their Sons thus, To little hopes of Wealth, they would have had More wit to keep it, and to spend it too. Leon. I thank you Sir. Basil. That younger villain hath his Mothers Lip, He sha'nt fare the worse for't. What frowning Sir! Look handsomely and kindly too, Or I'll again divorce thee from my Blood. Embrace each other strait, with free and willing arms. Orge. When I rejoyce we are so near a kin, 'Tis strange, I wish our loves were less ally'd. Dor. You are the elder, and I see the Will Of Fate inclines to further that Prerogative. Orge. That yields some little hope, Who is so courteous to go in and fill My Mistress ear with this new History. Leon. That pleasant business shall be mine. Exit. Orge. You Sir, from whom I took precedency By life, should sure have power to give that priviledge Unto my love: Let not my first, and elder claim (Assisted by my Mistress vows) give way Unto a younger interest, who wants Such great assurance, and doth onely last By th'vigor of his hope. Basil. I have pronounc'd the word, and he shall do't. Goes to Dorando. Will not you yield to time and nature Sir? And give your elder leave to play the loving fool Before you. You had best produce a trick Of disobedience at first sight? That I May think my Spanish Off-spring, chang'd for some Dull Dutch Burghers Issue, that sold Stockfish and Pickled Herring. Dor. His Deeds of Honor are so high, and his Compliances so low, I find I must Be overcome. Orge. But Sir, to intercede in my behalf, That is the business which her vow constrains. Basil. He shall do't. Dor. I'll force my reason Sir, at your command. Orge. Then Sorrows vanish, and my Joys appear. Basil. A very twig of the old Tree! Just thus I run a madding for his Mother at His years; and to this very hour do most Intirely reverence, a soft and pliant Lip. Enter Androlio, and Amiana vaild. Androl. W'have heard enough to make us venture in. Orgemon, if since your new-got parentage, You are become so stale a Gentleman To wear a knife about you, you shall find I have a throat at your service, will strait Confess my errors, and unbutton. Orge. No Sir, when you offend me next, you shall Receive the honor of my Sword. Androlio seems to pull Amiana to her Father. Andr. I've heard you want alliance, and delight To find them out, a Romance way. This Lady Freed lately from a dark inchanted Castle, Desires to call you Father; if you please T'accept her Sir, you may have me into the bargain. Basil. So there may be more got Sir, then I Can honestly keep. Andr. I'm a new Man, and have already seal'd To Marriage Articles of living tame; We onely want you and the Priest to witness it. Enter Marillia, Second Servant, Officers. Basil. Some tale in Dieava de Monte Major Taught you this trick of wandring after your lover. Your tears have pardon'd you, go know your Brothers. Orco takes Marillia aside. Amia. Could I have chosen Brothers by the pow'r Of wishes or my prayers, they had been these. Orge. We have much pretty story to examine. Dor. Such as will make the pleasures of this year, Transcend all that we ever know. Orco. Your Rebel-man is here (Androlio) brought By Officers, at this old Gentlewomans Complaint, for committing a Rape. Maril. Yes truly Sir, down in the Vault, towards The left corner by the Garden Stairs. I've cause To remember the place. Andr. I, thou'lt ne'er forget a good turn. Basil. How's that, a Rape! Maril. It had been so forsooth, had I not yielded (As they say) to prevent harm. Basil. Go take them both (Don Orco) to your care, I'll my self sit upon the cause, and call A Commission of Bedrid Judges, who will Be glad to revive their long lost mettal, By refreshing their old ears with baudry. Orco. I'll invite all the gallants to this hearing. Exeunt Orco, Marillia, Second Servant. Enter Claramante, Leonte. Orge. Now Brother is the time to make me happy, If that new title, or (what equals it,) (My friend) can urge you to such noble kindness. Dorando goes to Claramante. Dor. Fair Claramante, I am come t'undo My self, by giving of my love away, Because my fortune conspir'd not to rescu't by My valors help; but we are all so full Of joy and wonder here, that we are bountiful To mad excess, my Rival is my Brother now; His elder claim, and that first ratifi'd By your dear vows, makes me implore, you would Confirm him in your love; for I am highly pleas'd (Since fate did not decree your vertue, and Your beauty mine) that so supream a happiness Shall yet belong unto my name and blood. Clar. The wonder of your stories, I have been told Within; and next to my delight In Orgemon, I value most the benefit Which that infers of being ally'd to you. Orgemon brings her to Basilonte and Amiana, who salute her. Basil. Lady, that comfortable kiss I will Requite, with the best Jewel that Peru did yield, When my great Syre rifled the Crown of Atabalita. Orge. How gladly Claramante, I am rid Of those sad fears, thy noble anger caus'd. Clar. They all were due to your misgovern'd valor, and Your jealousie; but now they cease for ever. Orgemon salutes Leonte, Balthazar, and the rest. Orge. There's many forms requir'd to celebrate A strange affinity so newly known; But these shall be defer'd as lesser rites, And yield to Ceremonies far above Their use, the consummation of my love. Exeunt omnes.</field>
