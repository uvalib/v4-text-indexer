      <field name="fulltext">A goodly interlude of Nature compylyd by mayster Henry Medwall, chapleyn to the ryght reverent father in God Johan Morton, somtyme cardynall and archebyshop of Canterbury. Fyrst cometh in Mundus [The Worlde] and syttyth down and sayth nothynge, and wyth hym Worldly Affeccyon berynge a gown and cap and a gyrdyll for Man. Than cometh in Nature, Man, Reason, [Sensualyte,] and Innocencye, and Nature syttyth down and sayth: Nature Thalmyghty God that made eche creature As well in heven as other place erthly By hys wyse ordynaunce hath purveyd me, Nature, To be as mynyster under hym immedyately For thencheson that I shold perpetually Hys creatures in suche degre mayntayne As yt hath pleased hys grace for theym to ordeyne. To me yt longeth by naturall engendure Thyng to contynew that hath spyryte of lyfe, Whyche ne were my helpe shuld never endure But sodenly peryshe and wax all caytyfe. Atwyxt thelementys that whylom were at stryfe I have swaged the old repugnaunce And knyt theym togeder in maner of alyaunce. Eke I have ordeyned the goddys Deane Lady of the see and every freshe fontayn, Whyche comenly decreceth whan she gynneth wane And waxeth abundant whan she creceth agayne. Of eb and flode she ys cause certayne, And reyneth as prynces in every yle and town That wyth the see ys compassed envyron. I am causer of suche impressyon As appereth wonderouse to mannys syght, As of flammes that from the sterry regyon Semeth to fall in tymes of the nyght: Some shote sydelong and some down ryght, Whyche causeth the ignorant to stand in drede That sterrys do fallâyet falleth there none in dede. What nedeth yt to speke of thyngys here bylow As fowles, bestys, and fysshes in theyre kynde? Of trees, herbys, and stones how they grow, In whyche men sondry and meny vertuous fynde? One thyng be ye sure and thynk yt in your mynde: No maner creature may take on hym the cure Of these workys but onely I, Nature. And playnly there ys in erthe no maner thynge That ys not partyner of my influence. I do provyde for every beste lyvynge Of naturall foode alway suffycence, And geve theym also a maner of prudence Wherby they may naturally ensew Thyng that ys delectable and thother exchew. Who taught the cok hys watche howres to observe And syng of corage wyth shryll throte on hye? Who taught the pellycan her tender hart to carve For she nolde suffer her byrdys to dye? Who taught the nyghtyngall to recorde besyly Her strange entunys in sylence of the nyght? Certes I, Nature, and none other wyght. But yf that I shold clepe to memorye Eche strange effecte and every great mervayll That I have caused, I ensure you faythfully That rather tyme than processe shuld me fayll. Yt were your payne and to me but travayll All suche maters as now to bryng in place, Wherfore I let passe theym tell other tyme and space. But yf ye covet now to know theffecte Of thyngys naturall by trew conclusyon, Counsell with Arystotell my phylosopher electe, Whyche hath left in bokys of hys tradycyon How every thyng by hevynly constellacyon Is brought to effecte, and in what maner wyse, As far as mannys wytt may naturally compryse. Wherfore, syth God of hys great largesse Hath thus enryched me wyth dower of hys grace And made me as who seyth a wor[l]dly goddesse, Of duty I can no lesse do in thys case But wyth hartys joy and entyere solace My selfe addresse to do hys hygh pleasurs, And to thys same move all other creaturs. Enforce you therfore, hys creaturs eche on, To honour your maker wyth humble obeysance. Namely thow, Man, I speke to the alone Byfore all other as chyef of hys creance. Thynke how he hath made the to hys semblance: Pluck up thyn harte and hold thyn hed upryght, And ever more have heven in thy syght. Ovyde, in hys boke cleped The Transformacyon, Among all other hys fables and poesyes Maketh specyall mensyon of thy creacyon, Shewyng how God wonderously gan devyse Whan he the made and gave to the thempryse Of all thys world, and feoffed the wyth all As chyef possessyoner of thyngys mortuall. In token wherof he gave the upryght vysage And gave the in commaundement to lyft thyn eye Up towarde heven, only for that usage Thow shuldest know hym for thy Lorde almyghty; All other bestys, as thyngys unworthy, To behold therth wyth grovelyng countenaunce And be subdued to thyn obeysaunce. But as touchyng the cause specyally Wherfore I have ordeyned the thys nyght to appere, It ys to put the in knowlege and memorye To what entent thow art ordeyned to be here. I let the wyt thou arte a passanger That hast to do a great and longe vyage, And through the world most be thy passage. Addresse thy selfe now towardys thys journay, For as now thou shalt no lenger here abyde. Lo here Reason to governe the in thy way, And Sensualyte upon thyn other syde. But Reason I depute to be thy chyef gyde, Wyth Innocencye that ys thy tender noryce, Evermore to wene the from thappetyte of vyce. Man O Lord of Lordes, my Lord God immortuall, To the be honour and joy ever to endure, Whose hevenly empyre shall never be fynall But world wythout end remayne stable and sure, Whom heven and hell and erthly creature Wyth one assent and all wyth one accorde Honoureth, prayseth, and knowlegeth for theyre Lorde. To the myne hed I humbly inclyne, Thankyng thy grace that fyrst hast ordeyned me To be as a syly creature of thyne, And after that of thy great bownte Thou hast me set in soverayne degre And gyven me the profettys of every erthly thynge As well of frutys as of bestys lyvynge. And that that ys also most precyouse, Thou hast me enspyred wyth hevenly wysdome Wherby I may do workys mervaylouse In every place where soever I come. Of eche perfeccyon thy grace hath lent me some, So that I know that creature no where Of whose vertue I am not partyner. I have, as hath eche other element Among other in thys world a comen beyng Wyth herbys and trees, contynuall noryshement That ys suffysant to naturall lyvyng. Wyth sensuall bestys I have a maner of knowyng Wherby I shuld in good thyngys delyte And flee the contrary of myne appetyte. And over all thys thou hast gyven me vertue Surmountyng all other in hygh perfeccyon, That ys, understandyng, wherby I may avew And well dyscerne what ys to be done. Yet for all that have I fre eleccyon [To] do what I wyll, be yt evyll or well, And am put in the hande of myne own counsell. And in thys poynt I am halfe angelyke, Unto thy hevenly spyrytys almost egall, Albeyt in some parte I be to them unlyke: For they be ordeyned to endure perpetuall, And I wretched body shall have my funerall When yt pleaseth thy grace so to provydeâ Man ys not ordeyned alway here to abyde. Wherfore unto thy soverayne and hygh estate, Most hevenly Prynce, I make myne oryson: Syth yt hath pleased thy noble grace algate That I unworthy of so great renown In thys world shall have possessyon, Thou gyve me grace my selfe to enure As may me profyte and be to thy pleasure. Nature God hath herd thy prayer Mankynd, no dout, In all thy requestys and ryghtfull petycyon. Now forth thy journay, and loke well about That thou be not deceyved by fals prodycyon. Let Reason the governe in every condycyon, For yf thou do not to hys rule inclyne Yt wylbe to thy great myschef and ruyne. I wot well Sensualyte ys to the naturall And graunted to the in thy furst creacyon, But not wythstandyng, yt ought to be overall Subdued to Reason and under hys tuycyon. Thou hast now lybertye and nedest no maynmyssyon, And yf thou abond the to passyons sensuall, Farewele thy lybertyeâthou shalt wax thrall. Sensualyte What, lady Nature? Have I none intresse As well as Reason or Innocency? Thynke ye thys, lady, a good processe, That they are avaunced and I let go by? Ye knowe ryght well that I ought naturally Byfore all other to have of hym the cureâ I am the chyef perfeccyon of hys nature. Alas, what coulde the sely body do, Or how sholde yt lyve, ne were the helpe of me? Certes yt could not well crepe nor go! At the lest wyse yt shuld neyther fele, here, nor se, But be as other incensate bodys beâ In mouche wurs case than wormes of the grownde In whyche unneth any tokyn of lyfe ys founde. Me semeth yt shuld abhorr hym for to here That I destrayned shuld be in any wyse, Standynge that I was create to be hys fere, Of all hys guydyng to take thenterpryse. And now ye put me out of hys servyce And have assygned Reason to be hys guyde, Wyth Innocencye hys noryseâthus am I set asyde! Ye clepe hym lorde of all bestys lyvynge, And nothyng worthy as far as I can se. For yf there be in hym no maner of felynge Ne no lyvely quyknes, what lorde ys he? A lorde made of clowtys or karved out of tre, And fareth as an ymage graved out of stone That nothyng ellys can do but stande alone. If ye intend hym to contynew longe In honour or worldly felycyte, He most nedys folow hys apetyte amonge And conferme hym selfe to the more parte. I tell you, men wyll have no deynte To do servyce or homage to a blockâ All the world wyll thynk yt but a mock! Suffer me therfore to have wyth hym a rome And to be wyth hym as chyef counseyll[er], And yf he do so I thynk to dome He shall reygn in the world as chyef governer. But yf Reason tykyll hym in the ere Or bere hym on hand the kow is wood, He shall never be able to do erthly good. Nature My frend, as I sayd to you byfore, A rome shall ye haveâno man sayth nay. But Reason must be preferred evermore, For he can best lede hym to the way Of vertue and grace wherby he may Longest contynue to Goddys hygh pleasure To the whych end God hath ordeyned this hys creature. Content thy selfe now wyth Reason, my frend, And medyll the no further than thou hast to do. Thou hast brought many a man to a wrecched end And so thou woldyst spyll hys creature also. But what so ever he say, take no hede therto [To Man.] Wythout that Reason wyll alow the same, For who so doth the contrary deserveth myche blame. God and I, Nature, have set the in better case Than any creature under the fyrmament. Abuse not, Man, abuse not thy grace Of God almyghty that from above ys sent! Thou shalt be the fyrst that shall repent If ever thou fle Reason and sue Foly Whan onys thou felest the smert of mysery. But be of confort: hardely God shall send Both gostly ayd and worldly helpe also, And I shall never fayll unto thy lyfys end To mynyster unto the as me oweth to do. Lo yender the World whyche thou must nedys to! Now shape the thyder, there ys no more to say. Thy Lord and myne guyde the in thy way. Then Nature goeth out. Sensualyte Well lady Nature, leve ye me in thys case? Shall I have of you none other confort? By Cryst, yet wyll I not hyde my face, For as sone as we shall to the World resort I put no doubt he wyll me support! He hath ben my good mayster meny a day And he wyll not se me thus cast away! Reason Sobur thy selfe, man, I advyse the hardely. Be not so passyonate ne y[e]t so furyouse! Thou turmentyst thy selfe and wotyst not why. No well advysed body wyll demean hym thus! Be sure, thy mynde is all erronyous: Thou takyst a selfe-well and wrong opynyon Whyche shalbe thyn and others confusyon. Sensualyte Ye, Reason, syr, ye speke lyke a noble man, But yet are ye take wyth a poynt of oversyght. What? Wold ye make me stand as a lordan And not speke one word for myne own ryght? I se yt well that yf your lordshyp myght By meanes possyble onys bryng yt about, Your selfe shuld be a ruler and I but a cast owt. Reason A rular? Certes, and so I owght to be, And a lord also, though ye say yt in scorne. Sensualyte A lord? Whose lord? Reason Thy lord. Sensualyte Nay, so mote I the, Thou lyest! Yt may no lengar be forborne. Thou camyst but tonyght and mayst hap go tomorne, For yf thou be as haute as thou begynnest Thou shalt avoyd myche sonar than thou wennyst! Reason As for myne avoydaunce, how sone so ever yt be, It shall not skyll as for thys intent. But he that fyrst fleeth or forsaketh me, He shall have gretest occasyon to repent. It shalbe to hys great trouble and turment That he hath left Reason and suyd hys own foly And therby ys fallen to wreched penury. But now as touchyng the honour and degre That I am ordeyned to, I wyll thou understand That almyghty God of hys grace and bountye Of the and suche hath gyven me the over hand, And wyll that I use the as a servand To advyse the and reforme the whan thou gynst to erre And to clepe the homward yf thou rayll to far. And where thou sayst thou art so necessary That man wythout the can have no lyvyng, As in that poynt we shall not myche vary. I wote thou art necessary to hys beyng, But be thou sure, that ys not the very thyng That maketh hym to appere so wonderouse And to be in hys nature so noble and precyouse. It ys a thyng that doth ryght far excede All other perfeccyons and vertuouse naturall, For Sensualyte in very dede Is but a meane whyche causeth hym to fall Into moche foly and maketh hym bestyall So that there ys no dyfference in that at the lest Bytwyxt man and an unresonable best. But this other cometh of great tenderaunce And spyrytuall love that God oweth to mankynde, Whom he hath create to hys owne semblaunce And endued wyth a wonderouse mynde Wherby he may well dyscerne and fynde Suffysant dyfference bytwyxt good and bad, Whyche ys to be left and whyche ys to be had. Lo, thys ys yt that doth hym dygnyfye And causeth hym to be reputed so excellent. And of all thys the chyef doar am I, Whyche from heven into erth by God am sent Only for that cause and fynall intent That I shuld thys hys creature demean and guyd For the season that he doth in thys world abyde. Now compare thy vertues and myne togeder And say whyche ys the wurthyar of theym to. Sensualyte Whyche ys the worthyar? Forsoth, I trow neyther! We be good felowys! Reason Nay, my frend, not so! Thou ought to obey me where so ever I go. Sensualyte Nay, that shall I never do for to dye: I shall thy felow be, loke thou never so hye! And therfore, hardely, be somwhat felowlyke! Leve thyn hawt conceytys and take a metely way. For shame of the world, man, let us not styk At a mater of ryght noght and travers here all day. Have me in few wordys, man, and hark what I say: Medyll thou in no poynt that belongeth to me, And I shall promyse the never to medyll wyth the. And standyng the nonage of thys gentylman, On my parell take no care therfore. I shall demean yt as well as I can Tyll he be passyd forty yerys and more, And, Reason, then yf ye wyll, undershore Hys croked old age when lusty youth ys spent; Than take uppon you. I hold me content, For trust ye me the very trouth ys thys: Thys Man ys put in hys owne lybertye, And certaynly the fre choyce ys hys Wheder he wyll be governed by the or by me. Let us therfore put yt to hys owne jeopardye And therin stande to hys arbytrement To whyche of us twayne he had lever assent. Reason Nay, syr, not so! I know hys fraylte: The body ys dysposed for to fall Rather to the worse than the better parte But yt be holpen by power supernall. Sensualyte Yet, Reason, whan thou hast sayd all, Yf thou se hym not take hys owne way, Call me cut when thou metest me a nother day. Reason For cartayne, yet accordyng to myne offyce I must advertyse and counsell hym at the lest To hawnt vertue and schew all vyce And therin assyst hym to the uttermest. And yf he wyll algatys be a best And take none hede to my lore and doctryne, The parell and hurt shalbe hys and not myne. Innocencye Syrs, I shall answere for thys man as yet That he ys mayden for all suche foly As shold dystayne nature or dyshonour yt, Brought up wyth me full well and tenderly. Wherfore I dare the surelyar testyfye For innocencye that he ys yet vyrgyn Both for dede and eke consent of syn. And lengar wyll not I be of hys acquayntaunce Than he ys vertuouse and of good lyvyng, For fleshly lust and worldly plesaunce Ys wyth Innocencye nothyng accordyng. But yf hys behavyour and dayly demeanyng Be of suche draught as Reason wyll alow, I shall hym favour and love as I do now. Sensualyte Well spoken and wysely! Now, have ye all done? Or have ye ought ellys to thys man to say? Reason O syr, ye! Sensualyte Pece, no more of thys dysputacyon! Here be many fantasyes to dryve forth the dayâ That one chatreth lyke a pye, that other lyke a jay. And yet, whan they both have done what they can, Maugry theyr teeth I shall rule the man. Man O blessyd Lord, what maner stryf ys thys Atwyxt my Reason and Sensualyte? That one meneth well and that other all amysse. In one ys sekernes and in tother great fraylte, And both they be so annexed to me That nedes I must wyth one of theym abyde! Lorde, as thou thynkyst best, for me do provyde! For I am wonderously entryked in thys case And almost brought into perplexyte, Notwythstandyng, thanked be thy grace, As I dyd never assent ne aggre To thynge that sholde be contraryouse unto theâ Of synfull ded and thought all innocent, Subduyd to Reason as hys obedyent. Reason Cryst graunt you therin good contynuaunce To be ever of the same mynde and intent! But now wyll ye call to your remembraunce For what cause ye be hyder sent? I hold yt well done and ryght expedyent That ye were brough[t] unto the Worldys presence. Man Be yt so! In Goddys name, I pray you, go we hens. Reason And wyll ye that I shall for you declare Unto the World the cause of your comyng, What ys your intent, and what parson ye are? Man Ye, I wold be glad that every thyng Be done even after your devysyng. Sensualyte Shall I than stand as I were tong tyde? Man Ye, hardely, tyll Reason have sayd. Reason Syr World, yt ys the mynde and also pleasure Of lady Nature, as she bad us to you tell, That ye accept and receyve thys her creature Wyth you for a season here to dwell, Desyryng you hartely to entreat hym well Wyth all the favour that ye can devyse, Wherin ye shall do her great pleasure and servyce. The Worlde Syrs, ye be welcome to us hartely! Your message ys to us ryght acceptable. Be ye assured there ys nothyng erthly To us so joyfull ne yet so delectable As to be acquaynted wyth parsons honorable, Namely souch as ye seme to be, Men of hygh honour and of great dygnyte. And as touchyng the message that ye have brought, [We] have therof the full mynde and intent, Assuryng you that our bysy thought Shalbe to do dame Naturys commaundement. And thereunto we wyll be dylygent To do her pleasurys in that we may, And so we wold ye shold to her say. And w[h]ere ye shew unto me that thys Man Is ordeyned to reygne here in thys empry, I assent well, for or Nature began To shape the world, she thought fynally To ordeyne Man therin to occupy, He to take uppon hym as myghty governer, Havyng all thyng subdued to hys power. Wherfore I receyve gretly hys comyng. Mankynde syr, hartely welcom ye be! Ye are the parsone, wythout faynyng, That I have evermore desyred to se. Come let me kys you! O benedycyte, Ye be all naked! Alas Man, why thus, I make you sure, yt ys ryght perylous! Man I thanke you, but I nede none other vesture. Nature hath clothed me as yet suffysantly: Gyltles of syn, and as a mayden pure, I were on me the garment of Innocencye. Innocencye Ye hardely, were that garment contynually! It shall thy body suffysantly savegard From stormy weder, my lyfe to jeopard! The Worlde Be pece, fayre woman! Ye ar not very wyse. Care ye not yf thys body take cold? Ye must consyder thys ys not paradyse, Ne yet so temporate by a thowsand fold! Who so lyveth here, be he yong or old, He must suffer both fervent cold and hete And be out of temperaunce oft tyme in hys dyet. Also he must nedys do as the Worlde doth That intendeth any whyle here to reygne, And folow the gyse that now a day goth As far as hys estate may yt mayntayne. And who doth the contraryâI wyll be playneâ He ys abyect and dyspysed utterly And standeth ever baneshed from all good company. Syth God therfore had ordeyned thys body To dwell here in thys erthly regyon, Of convenyence he must hym selfe apply To worldly thyngys and be of suche condycyon As all men be, and leve eche fond opynyon That ys not approvable of wysar men than he: To take suche way yt ys but vanyte! [The Worlde rises to give Man the robe, cap, and girdle.] Take thys garment, Man; do as I you byd! Be not ashamed, hardely, to do yt on. So lo, now thys gurdell, have gurd yt in the myd, And thys for your hed go set yt uppon. By the charge of me, you be a goodly on As ever I saw syth that I was borne, Worth a thowsand that ye were beforne! Gyve me your handâbe not in fere! Syt down as ye ar borne to occupye thys place. [Man sits in the Worlde's throne.] I gyve you here auctoryte and power Over all thynge that conceyved ys in the space Of all the erth that rownd ys in compace, To be as lord of every regyon, And therof I gyve you pessyble possessyon. Man Blessyd be thou my lord most bounteouse, That of thy great abundant cheryte Me thy wretched creature hast honoured thus Wyth naturall gyftys and worldly dygnyte. Now I beseke the, for thy great pyte, Syth thou hast set me in so noble way, Suffer me not hereafter wrechedly to decay. For certes, yt ys myne hartys desyre So to demayn me in thys lyfe present As may be most unto thy pleasure And unto Nature not dysconvenyent. Thys ys my wyll and my chyef intent, Thys wyll I observeâthy grace to borowâ Though I therfore suffer mouche worldly sorow. Reason Forsoth, these wordys be gretly to alow Yf they from meke and lowly hart procede. Now Mankynde, syth thou hast made thys vow, Shape the therafter thy lyfe to lede, And let thy word be cousyn to thy dede: That ys to say, do thou none other wyse Than thou here openly to God dost promyse. Innocencye Ye syr, and ever loke that ye abstayne Not onely from dede but also from the assent, So that ye commyt neyther of theym twayn Yf ye wyll observe the hygh commaundement. For surely ye may not be cleped innocent Nor gyltles of syn, as far as I can fynde, Yf onys ye assent to folly in your mynde. The Worlde Thys ys an harde word, syster, that ye have spoken, An hard worde surely and an hevy sentence. But thynk ye Goddys commaundement broken For a lyght tryfull and mater of insolence? Alas, have ye suche a spyced conscyence That wyll be entryked wyth every mery thought? Leve yt woman, leve yt, for yt ys nought. Loquitur ad hominem. And Man, as for you, ye shall not take that wayâ That maner of observaunce ys to hard and strayte. Ye must attempte the world and therin assay Whether ye can lyve after that endrayte. These two folk harp both on refrayte And ever enbesyeth theym to rebuke you of syn That never was spotted ne fownd gylty therin. Take none hede of theymâtheyre wordys be but wynde, And as for thys tyme I commaunde theym to sylence! And let us se now how prately ye can fynde By sage polycy and worldly prudence To mayntayne the state in honour and reverence That ye shall be in whyle ye in the world dwell. Speke of thys mater and ponder yt well. Fyrst me semeth necessary to provyde What maner folkys your sarvauntys shall be, For surely ye ar nothyng accompanyde Accordyng to a man of your degre! Ye have here wyth you two parsons or thre That pleaseth you happely in the best wyse, Yet yt appereth not so to every mannys [gyse]. What man ys thys? Man Reason, syr, my chyef conselour, And thys Innocency my noryce hyderto, And Sensualyte that other by whom I have power To do as all sensate bestys do. But Reason and Innocency, chyefly these two, Have the hole rule and governy of me, To whom eke ys subdued my Sensualyte. Sensualyte For cartayne syr, Reason hath done me wrong More than ever he shalbe able to recompense. God knoweth syr, I thought the season very long Tyll we were brought unto your presence. But now I pray you to adnull the sentence That Nature gave unto me by Reasons advyse To my great hurt and uttyr prejudyce. And syr, I aske none amendys erthly But that Reason may have a chek mate, A lytell knack, a lytell prayty congy Hys haut corage some thynge to abate. For hyderto he hath kept great estate And had of me the over hande and strengar: Be ye not dyspleasedâI wyll suffer yt no lengar. The Worlde Thou hast had great wrong and that ys pyte, For yf thou be the parson that I take the fore, Thou sholdyst be as honorable as he. Sensualyte Lord ye say well, but wold God ye wold se Some maner helpe and remedy for thys evyll And let me not alway lyve thys lyke a dryvyll! The Worlde Syr, ye know well that yf so yt were [To Man.] A man shold sodenly come to a straunge place Wherin he ys but alyand and straunger, He must nedys be compelled in that case To put hym selfe in the favour and grace Of some syngler person that can shew hym the way Of all the behavour and gyse in that contray. So yt ys now that ye be hyder sent, Thys contray as yet to you unknowen. In myne opynyon yt ys expedyent To take some other counsell than your awne Of well enured men suche as have growne In worldly experyence and have therof the dryft And can best for you in tyme of nede skyft. Man Certes ye move ryght well and prudently, And I am well content that yt so be. But as yet have I not the polycy To know whyche men have most abylyte. The Worlde Dare ye commyt the mater unto me? Man Ye syr, ryght well. I am fully content That all thynge be done by your assygnement. The Worlde Than thus I wyll: that above all thyng From hens forward ye be lyke and conformable Unto other parsones in all your demeanyng, Namely to suche as be companable, Be they never so vycyouse or abhomynable. For every man clepyth hym wyse That doth after the comen gyse. And as for men that shold do you servyce, I know dyvers persones that be ryght honorable That can you serve alway poynt devyce: In all the worlde be there none so able, So wyse, so polytyke, ne yet so profytable. Lo here ys one of theym that I speke fore, And he hym selfe can tell you where ye shall have more. Worldly Affeccyon ys thys mannys name. He ys well brayned and wonderous of invencyon, A forecastyng man and, payne of shame, Ye shall not fynde in any Crysten regyon A wyser felow in thyngys to be done, Specyally of maters that be concernyng Worldly pleasure that ys for you accordyng. Suffer hym therfore never to departe But yf yt be for maters of great substaunce. And for Sensualyte, I pray you wyth all my harte To accept hym to your favour and tendraunce: He hath ben longe of myne acquayntaunce And, on my fayth, my harte can not but grudge To thynke that ye shold use hym as a drudge. Do as he advyseth you hardely, now and than, And dyspyse not utterly hys counsell. Thynke that ye be here a worldly man And must do as men that in the world dwell. Ye ar not bounde to lyve lyke an aungell Ne to be as God alway immutableâ Mannys nature of hym selfe ys full myserable. I have tolde you now my counsell and advyse And ye have promysed to be ruled therby. Now let eche man execute hys offyce And se how wysely ye can theym occupy To encreace the world, and yt therto ye must apply. Now addresse you therto and demeane you thusâ I shalbe to you ever good and prosperouse. Man Syr, I thank you of thys curtesy, Undeserved as yet, but be ye sure I shall my selfe endevour bysyly To do that may be to your pleasure. And for the season that I shall her[e] endure, I shall theym cheryce and to my power mayntayne That unto you in any wyse do partayne. The Worlde Than to bygyn wyth all, I wyll advyse you To put thys man from your company. I tell you, every man wyll despyse you As long as ye be ruled by Innocency. To folow suche counsell yt ys but foly, For he can neyther good neyther evyll, And therfore he ys taken but for a dryvyll. Man By my fayth, evyn as ye say It lyketh me not ryght well Wyth Innocency longe to dwell. Therfore, accordyng to your counsell, I wyll not after thys day Wyth hys company my selfe affere As mewet as yt were a Gray Frere! I suppose there ys no man here What soever he be That could in hys mynde be content Allwayes to be called an innocent. Wherfore yt ys myne intent To do as ye advyse me. The Worlde Ye hardely, do evyn so. Innocencye Forsoth, and I hold me well content To departe at your commaundement. Ye shall fynde me obedyent What soever ye byd me do. Here Innocencye goeth out. [Reason withdraws.] Sensualyte So, the company ys well amend! Let hym go to the devyll of hell! He ys but a boy, I warn you well, And shuld ye folow hys counsell Allmyghty God defend! Yf ever ye lust to play the man, It ys tyme that ye now bygan, Mary, to play the boy now and than For your dysport and solace! It forceth not though ye do Whan ye may have leyser therto, And among I wyll helpe you also In due tyme and place. The Worlde Ye, that ye wyll in dede! But now syr, wyll ye any thyng Commaund me byfore my departyng? Man Nothyng at all, to my wetyng, But our Lord have you in hys kypyng And send you well to spede. [The Worlde goes out.] Worldly Affeccyon, come hyder: ye are polytyke And myche better enured in thys world than I. I pray you dyspose for me as ye thynk most lyke That I may lyve here well and honorably. Worldly Affeccyon Ye syr, I shall. Dout ye not, hardely, Yf yt lyke you to put me in so great trust, And I trow ye shall fynde me trew and just. Man I wote well I shall. Surely you be bound To the World that hath gyven you so great commendacyon. Worldly Affeccyon Ye syr, some men had lever than a thowsand pound They myght be commended of the same fassyon! But syr, let passe all thys commendacyon And answere to me, I pray you, frutefully In that I shall meve you substancyally. Syr, at few wordys I you exhorte: Syth that ye be come to your own, Cast your selfe to bere suche a porte That as ye be ye may be knowen. Eke yt ys necessary for that behove That there be made some maner of purvyaunce Wherby ye may bere out your countenaunce. Wyll yt lyke you therfore that I survey And se thextent of all your land And thereuppon in all the hast purvey Both for you and yours all maner of vyand, Wyth other utensyllys redy at your hand, So that ye be purveyd all tymes erely and late Of eche thyng that belongeth to your estate? Man Your counsell ys goodâdo as ye thynk best! I commyt all suche thyng to your dyscrecyon. Worldly Affeccyon I shall do my trew bysynes at the lest To bryng all thyngys to good conclusyon. [Worldly Affeccyon offers to go out Man Abyde, Worldly Affeccyon! Ye made no mencyon Who shuld awayt and gyve attendaunce. I must have mo servauntys what so ever chaunce! Worldly Affeccyon What? Ye have Sensualyteâax never other counsell. Of suche mater he can you best advyse. He knoweth where all suche maner parsons dwell As be moste apte to do you worldly sarvyce. Then he goeth out. Sensualyte Ye, on my parell syr, I shall take the enterpryse Of all suche maters, and loke where I fynde Any man of pleasure, on hym set your mynde! Lo, wyll ye se? Lo, here cometh oneâ Even the last man that was in my thought. Man What ys he? Sensualyte Ye shall se anon: A well drawen man ys he, and a well taught, That wyll not gyve hys hed for nought, And therto goodly as ye shall se in a day, As well apparelyd at eche poynt of hys aray. Pryde co[meth in, with Garcius.] Pryde Who dwelleth here? Wyll no man speke? Is there no fole nor hody peke? Now by the bell, yt were almys to breke Some of these knaves brows! A gentylman comys in at the dorys That all hys dayes hath worn gylt sporys, And none of thys knaves nor cutted horys Byddys hym welcom to house. Wote ye not how great a lord I am, Of how noble progeny I cam?â My fader a knyght, my moder callyd madame, Myne aunceters great estatys? And now the lyvelod ys to me fall By both theyre dethes naturall. I am spoken of more than they all Hens to Parys gatys. How say ye, syrs, by myne aray? Doth yt please you? Ye or nay? In the best wyse, I dare well say, By that ye knowe me a whyle! And one thyng I put you out of dout: I have wherwyth to bere yt out As well as any man here about Wythin these hundreth myle. Behold the bonet uppon my hed: A staryng colour of scarlet redâ I promyse you, a fyne threde And a soft wull! It cost me a noble at one pyche! The scald capper sware sythyche That yt cost hym even as mycheâ But there Pryde had a pull. I love yt well to have syde here Halfe a fote byneth myne ere, For ever more I stande in fere That myne nek shold take cold! I knyt yt up all the nyght And the day tyme kemb yt down ryght, And then yt cryspeth and shyneth as bryght As any pyrled gold. My doublet ys onlaced byfore, A stomacher of saten and no more. Rayn yt snow yt never so sore, Me thynketh I am to hote! Than have I suche a short gown Wyth wyde sleves that hang adownâ They wold make some lad in thys town A doublet and a cote. Som men wold thynk that this were pryde, But yt ys not so! Ho, ho, abyde! I have a dagger by my sydeâ Yet therof spake not I. I bought thys dagger at the marte, A sharp poynt and a tarte: He that had yt in hys hart Were as good to dye. Than have I a sworde or twayn! To bere theym my selfe yt were a payne: They ar so hevy that I am fayne To purvey suche a ladâ Though I say yt, a praty boy! It ys halfe my lyves joy! He maketh me laugh wyth many a toy, The urchyn ys so mad. I begate the horson in bast: It was done all in hast! Ye may se there was no wastâ He occupyed no great place! Sometyme he serveth me at borde, Somtyme he bereth my two hand sword. Com forth thou lytell lyk-tordâ Loke in thy faders face! But now to do that I com fore, And of these thyngys to speke no more. Hark syrs, me longeth sore To here some newelte. I here say there ys a great state Com into thys contray late And ys dysposed algate An housholder to be. Fathers soule syrs! Ye shall understand That yf he kepe houshold in thys land I wyll threst in one hand Who so ever say nay. What so ever the man intendâ To appayre the world or to amendâ I wylbe wyth hym at that one end, Hap what hap may. I mete Worldly Affeccyon ere wyle From thys town skant a myle, And he hath shewed me a praty whyle If I may put yt in ure: He tellys me that Sensualyte Begynnys a great rular to be, And yf yt be so, care not for meâ The mater ys cok sure. [Notices Man.] Ey good Lord, what man ys that? Fathers soule, thys ys some great wat! Garcius Thys ys he that ye seeke. Pryde Se thys brat? Thys boy ys passyng taunte! Com behynd and folow meâ Set out the better leg I warne the! Garcius Yes, in the best wyse, trust ye me. Ale seygniour, ale vouse avant! Pryde Saluys to you syr. Man And to you also. Whens are ye? Pryde I shall tell you or I go, But fyrst wold I speke a worde and no mo Wyth thys sarvant of yours. Sensualyte Wyth me syr? Wolde ye speke wyth me? Pryde Ye, for God! Are ye not Sensualyte? Sensualyte Yes, surely. Pryde Ye, such a gentylman ye seme to be. Sensualyte Your pore sarvaunt at all howris! Then Pryde speketh to Sensualyte in hys ere that all may here: Pryde Syr, I understand that this gentylman is borne to great fortunes and intendeth to inhabyt here in the contray. And I am a gentylman that alway hath be brought up wyth great estatys and affeed wyth them, and yf I myght be in lyke favour wyth this gentylman, I wold be glad therof and do you a pleasure. Sensualyte Where ys your dwellynge? Pryde I dwell herby. Sensualyte What ys your name? Pryde Pryde. Sensualyte Pryde? Pryde Ye, sykerly, But I am cleped Worshyp comenly In placys where I dwell. Sensualyte Worshyp? Now in fayth, ye say trew: Ye be radix viciorumârote of all vertew. Pryde Ye, ye, man! Ye wolde say so yf ye me knew. Sensualyte Turd! I know you well! [Aside.] Syr, ye are welcom as I may say! I shall bryng you in servyce yf I may And yf one man stand not in the way. Pryde One man? What the devyll ys he? Sensualyte By God, one that loveth not the Nor me neyther. Pryde I pray the tell me What maner of man he ys And I shall gyve hym a lyft as I gesse! Sensualyte Wylt thou so, doubtlesse? Pryde Ye, and that wythin a short processe: In fayth, I wyll not mysse! Sensualyte Surely I can not spy the wayes how! Pryde Let me alone, I shall do well ynow! Aquaynt me wyth that man, and care not thouâ The mater shall spede. Sensualyte Hark, cosyn: fyrst spede thys mater, And yf yender man make the not good chere As ony man that ever cam here, Let me therfore be dede. Pryde Syr, I shall tell the how: whan I am in To thy maysters servyce, I wyll fyrst begyn To set hys hart on a mery pyn And byd hym make good chere. I wyll byd hym thynk how he ys create To be a worthy potestate And eke that he ys predestynate To be a prynces pere, And other thyngys more than thys: I shall bryng that hart of hys To be more howt than yt ys By a dewys-ase! Specyally I wyll commend hys wyt That no man can amend yt, And that he ys able therby to syt As a juge in Comen Place. And when I prayse hym thys wyse, I thynke hys hart wyll begyn to ryse And after that utterly despyse Any opray counsell to here. He shall trust all to hys own brayne And than, wold Reason never so fayne, Though he come and suche opry twayn, He shalbe never the nere! Sensualyte Surely thys conseyt ys well found. I shall bryng the in servyce for twaynty pound! Pryde Gramercy brother, I thynk me mych bound To the for thy curtesy. But syr, abyde here on thyng: I wyll not be knowen that yt ys my sekyng! Sensualyte No more wold I, for forty shelyng. Let me alone hardely! Syr, yf yt please you, here ys come a straunger [To Man.] That never was aquaynted wyth you ere, Somwhat shamefast and halfe in fere To put hym selfe in prese: A goodly parsone, be ye sure, Both of countenaunce and of feature If he were drawn in portrayture, And a good man doubtlesâ Ye, and a wyse man at all! Wyll yt please you that I hym call To speke wyth you? Man Byd hym com. Sensualyte I shall. Syr, wyll ye come nere? [To Pryde.] Syr, byd hym welcome for the maner sake. [To Man.] Another day I am sure he wyll crake And say suche a gentylman dyd hym make Very great chere! Desyre hym for to dwell wyth youâ I tell you he ys a man for your prow And knoweth the world well inow, No man better than he. Man Syr, ye be welcom to thys place. Pryde I thanke you syr, but I do you trespace To come thus homly. Sensualyte Ye, a parlous case! [To Pryde.] God wote, ye are welcom heder! On my fayth, by my wyll Ye shall dwell wyth us styll. Go nere to hym and talk your fyllâ I leve you togeder. He goeth forth. Man Now syr, what have ye to say to me? Pryde No great thyng syr, but I come to se And to know what maner man ye be That all men prayseth so mouche! Man Prayse? Whom prayse they? Pryde Mary, you. Man Me? Pryde Ye syr, I make myne avow! They gyve you a praysyng good inowâ I harde never none suche. And surely, ye be ryght wurthyâ I se well now they do not ly! And therefore I dyd me hyder hy To acquaynt me wyth you. But ye may say that I am bold! Man Nay, ye ar worth thy weyght of gold. Me thenketh me to you myche behold! I pray you, what ys your name? Pryde My name ys Wurshyp. Man Wurshyp? Now surely, The World told me yt was my destyny To come to Wurshyp or I dye. Pryde Truly, I am the same. Man Now Wurshyp, I pray you me tell Your wysedom and also counsell: Ye can advertyse me passyng well In thyngys that I have to do. Pryde In good fayth, any thyng that I May do to your pleasure, yt ys redy. I am your own and pray you hartely That ye accept me so. But where ye aske counsell of me, Me semeth ye save not your honeste. Man Myne honesty? Wherfore let se? I pray you shew me why! Pryde Mary syr, for yt ys ryght syttyng That a man of your behavyng Shuld have alway suffycyent conyng Of worldly wyt and polycy To guyde hym selfe every where, And not to be led by the ere And beg wyt here and there Of every jak-a-pye. Ye are well complexyond be ye sure, And Nature hath done on you here cure As myche as upon any creature That ever I saw wyth myne eye. And by lykelyhod syr, iwys, Ye have wyt accordyng to all thys, Or ellys Nature hath wrought amysse, And that ys not lykely! Man Now certayne, thanked be heven Kyng, I have a ryght quyk understandyng: If ye shew me any thyng I can sone perceyve yt. But I was forbyd by Reason On myne own fantasye to ron Or to take any presumpcyon Of myne own wyt. Pryde Sayd Reason so? Mary, fy on him knave! Yt were better the hangman where in his grave Than ever the lewd fole shold have The governaunce of you! Man Certayn, Nature advysed me To folow Reason what tyme that she Put me fyrst in auctoryte That I stand in now. Pryde Alas, alas, Man, ye be mad! I se well ye be but a very lad! On my fayth, I was very glad Of your fyrst acquayntaunce, And now I forthynk yt utterlyâ That ever I knew you, fy, fy, fy! I hard never certaynly Of suche a nother chaunce. Wyll ye draw to that felyshyp? I wold ye had thre strypes wyth a whyp Even upon the bare hyp, If I shuld you not greve. He that wold lordshyp enjoy And playe ever styll the old boy, Me semeth he doth but make a toy And ye wyll me beleve. Man Wurshyp, for Goddys sake greve ye not! Pryde Iwys, ye ar but an ydeot. I pray you syr, make not me a sot. I am no tryfler! I have bene in honour here to forne! Ye alow the counsell of a karle borne Byfore myne: I have yt in scorne, It ys a thyng I can not bere. Man Whom meane ye? Reason? Pryde Ye, that same daw! Man What? Ys he a wyse man? Pryde He ys a straw! Bycause he kepys you under aw, Ye be therin blynd! Man And so doth he, wythout faynyng! For hyderto I myght do nothyng But after hys wyll and byddyng, And that groged my mynde. Pryde Grouge, quod a? Yt ys no marvell, hardely! It shall greve me certaynly As longe as I am in your cumpany To se you demeaned in that wyse. Ye be now in good way, But in fayth I lyke not your aray: It ys not the fassyon that goth now a day, For now there ys a new guyse! It ys now two dayes agon Syth that men bygan thys fassyon, And every knave had yt anon! Therfore, at thys season There ys no man that setteth thereby If he love hys own honesty. Man So me semeth, certaynly, That every man ys fressher than I, And iwys, that ys no reason. Here cometh in Worldly Affeccyon and Sensualyte. Sensualyte Reason, quod a? No, no! But syr, wote ye what ye shall do? Hardely, let us two go To some tavern here bysydeâ Com on, I can bryng you thereâ And let theym alone wyth all thys gere. Care ye nothyng for the mater, But let theym here abyde! And ye wyll suffer and let theym alone, Ye shall se them devyse you a new fassyon That all the world shall wonder theron. Man By God, that wyll I do goodly. But I pray you syrs, do your dylygence For thys aray and spare none expence, And for a whyle I wyll go hens And come agayne shortly. Here Man and Sensualyte go out. Worldly Affeccyon Brother Pryde, now the weyght Of all thys mater resteth in the. Pryde Tushe! Thou shalt se me devyse it even streyghtâ It ys but japes that gere wyth me! I have none other study a dayes parde But how I may new fassyons fynde, And theron I set all my labour and mynde. Syr, our mayster shall have a gown That all the galandys in thys town Shall on the fassyon wonderâ It shall not be sowed but wyth a lace Bytwyxt every seme a space Of two handfull asonder. Than a doublet of the new make: Close byfore and open on the bakâ No sleve upon hys arme. Under that a shyrt as soft as sylk And as whyte as any mylk To kepe the carcas warm. Than shall hys hosen be stryped, Wyth corselettys of fyne velvet slyped Down to the hard kne, And fro the kne downward Hys hosen shalbe freshely gard Wyth colours two or thre. And whan he is in suche aray, âThere goth a rutter!â men wyll say. âA rutter? Huf, a galand!â Ye shall se these foles on hym gase And muse as yt were on a mase New brought into the land! Worldly Affeccyon Ha, ha, ha! Now by the Mary Vyrgyn, Thys wyll set hym on a mery pyn Even as yt shuld be. But ever I am in great fere That Reason wyll whyster hym in the ere And torne hys mynd clene fro thys gereâ Thys thynge fereth me! Pryde Reason? Nay, nay, hardely, He ys forsaken utterly! Syth I cam to hys company He wold not onys appere. Never thelesse, for a surte, Worldly Affeccyon, I advyse the As shortely as ever yt may be For spede of the mater To bryng hym shortly in acquayntaunce Wyth all the company of myne affyaunce And let theym gyve contynuall attendaunce, Every man bysyly After the propertye of hys offyce: Than shall ye se hym utterly despyce Reasons counsellâon warrantyse!â And forsake hym utterly. [Sensualyte comes in.] Sensualyte Nay, nay, syrs, care ye nothynge! That mater ys sped well and fyne. Pryde Is yt so? Sensualyte Ye, by heven kyng, Even as we sat togeder at the wyne. Wordly Affeccyon Thou shalt have Goddys blessyng and myne! But ys yt true? Sensualyte Ye syr, by thys day! Our mayster and Reason have made a great fray. Pryde How so? Sensualyte By my fayth, we sat together At the tavern next herby And anon who shuld come together But fleyng Kat and Margeryâ She that bygyled you parde so prately And bare away your shyrt the last mornyng Stede of her smok whyle ye lay slepyng. Pryde I wote whom ye meane well inowâ But that ys nothyng to thys purpose. Tell on thy tale, for God avow! Sensualyte I shall anon had I wypt my nose. Syr, whan I spyde theym, anon I rose And called theym unto me by name, And wythout more taryeng anon they came And sat down with us and made nothyng straungâ As they be full curteys ye know yt wellâ And anon our maysters colour bygan to chaunge! Wherof yt cam I can not tell, Hys chere was appalled every dell, And scant that he coulde speke to me one word But stert hym even up and rose fro the bord. He sayd he wold go ly down on a bed, And prayd me for the maners sake That Margery myght com hold hys hede, Whyche as he told me bygan to ake. And so she hath hym undertake To make hym hole in an houre or twayne Whan soever he hath any suche soden payn. What yt meaneth I wote never, But he lyketh her physyk so well That I trow the devyll of hell Can not theym two dyssever. Lo thys have I done, and what trow ye more? Yet can I tell you better tydyng! Worldly Affeccyon What ys that? Sensualyte Mary, Reason, that ye two spake of byfore, Cam even to us as we sat so drynkyng And gave our mayster an hete worth an hangyng Bycause that Margery sat on hys kne Whyle that other hore sat talkyng wyth me. My mayster saw that he coulde have no rest Nor never be ryd of thys controllyng: He played the man and thought yt best, And wyth an angry loke, to my semyng, Drew out hys sword wythout more taryeng And smote Reason so on the hed That I have great marvayll but he be now dede. Worldly Affeccyon Mary, than fyll all the cuppes at ones If thys be trew! Sensualyte Yes, by these ten bones, I lye never a word! Pryde Trowyst thou yt ys no fayned stryfe Bytwyxt theym two? Sensualyte No, on my lyfe, For whan they faught I ran bytwene And cryed, âKepe pece and leve debate!â But ye wold have laughed had ye sene How I departed theym, and for all that Sometyme I clapped Reason on the pate And cryed, âKepe the pece!â as fast as I coudeâ Tyll I was horse I cryed so loude! Worldly Affeccyon But can our master play the man now And fare wyth thys gere? Sensualyte Ye, make God avow! And beware ye of one thyng: Medyll ye no more wyth Margery, For by cokkys precyouse body, If our mayster may yt espy Or have an understandyng That ye use her company, I tell you he wyll be angry. He ys so full of jelosy As ever I knew man! Worldly Affeccyon Jelosy? Pece man, be styll! He can therof no maner of skyll! Sensualyte No? But say what ye wyll, I am sure he can. He ys now as famylyer Wyth Bodely Lust as ever ye were, Ye, and therto as great a swerer Whan tyme requyres. Knew I never of hys age A man of better corage To do all maner of outrage After our desyres. Syth Reason and he were thus at varyaunce, He hath be full of suche dalyaunce And hath called to hys favour and acquayntaunce Your kynnesmen by and by: Envy, Wreth, Glotony, and Covetyse, Slouth, and Lechery be come to hys servyce, And utterly he hatyth theyre contraryse, And that he professeth openly. Worldly Affeccyon And be these folke of hys retynue? Sensualyte Ye, everychon, I tell you trew! But mary, there names be chaunged new For to blere hys eye. I tell you he ys a ferefull man, For Reason styrreth hym now and than. And therfore, do we what we can, It ys lytell inow, hardely. Syra, there ys fyrst Pryde as ye wot well, The swete darlynge of the devyll of hell: How hys name ys chaunged ye can tell! Worldly Affeccyon Ye mary, on the best wyse: Wurshyp I wene ys now hys name. Sensualyte Ye, by the rode, even the same. And Covetyse, to eschue all blame, Doth hys name dysgyse And calleth hym selfe Worldly Polycy. Wreth, bycause he ys somwhat hasty, Is called Manhode. Then ys there Envy, And he ys called Dysdayn. Glotony for Good Felyshyp ys taken, And Slouth hys old name hath forsaken And as fayre a name hath he shapen As ever man coulde ordayn: He ys called Ease, ryght confortable to the blod, Specyally for theym that luste to do no good. And amonge all other I wold ye understode That Lechery ys called Lust. Lo, these be fayre names parde, Both good and honest as semeth me. As for theyre condycyons, what they be Ye know well! Worldly Affeccyon Very just! I know theyre condycyons on the best wyse, Yf they kepe styll theyre old gyse. Sensualyte Yes, that they do, on warantyse. Worldly Affeccyon But yet I have great marvayll That Covetyse shuld dwell in hys company! Sensualyte By my trouth, lo, and so have I. But one thyng I ensure you faythfully, And that I have espyed well: That hyderto our mayster setteth no store By hys councell nor hys lore. Mary, whan hys hed waxeth hore, Than shalbe good season To folow Covetyse and hys wayâ Ye, tyme inow a nother day! Even so I hard our mayster say. Worldly Affeccyon By my fayth, he sayd but reason. But all the remanent be well retayned? Sensualyte Ye, be ye sure, yt ys mater unfayned. And wote ye who ys gretely dysdayned Wyth our mayster now? Pryde Who? Sensualyte By God, even Shamfastnes! Whan he shall do any suche excesse No shame can fere hym doubtles, I may say to you. Pryde No? Than the craft were nought. But now syrs, well bethought: Syth the mater ys hereto brought, It ys tyme for me To go and make some provysyon Of garmentys after the new invencyon As he commaunded me to be don. Therto must I se, For yt ys commytted to my neglygence. And yf he come hyder whyle I am hens, I pray the excuse myne absens. Sensualyte Ye, and myne also. Pryde Why, wylt thou go wyth me? Sensualyte Wyll I, quod a? Ye, parde: It ys accordyng for Sensualyte Wyth Pryde for to go! [Pryde, Garcius, and Sensualyte go out.] Worldly Affeccyon Now the mater ys allmost in good case After the Worldys mynde and pleasure! There ys no more but now must I cumpace Wyth all my wyt and besy endevure How it may be stablysshed and contynued sure, For a lytell fantasy of mannys own wyll May quayll thys mater and utterly yt spyll. And yf he vary agayne Of scrypyll Ymagynacyon Or ellys by the suggestyon Of the forsayd Reason, One thyng I am certayne: He wyll no lengar me support, And that were a shrewd crank dort! Therfore yt ys best that I resort To my maysters presence And se of what demeanour he ys. I am gretely to blame iwys, For that I saw hym not or thys Syth he departed hens. He goeth out and Reason cometh in. Reason O good Lord, to whom shall I complayn And shew the sorowes of my mynde? And nothyng for myne own cause certayn, But onely for the decay of Mankynde, Whyche now of late ys waxen so blynde That he hath dyspysed and forsaken me And foloweth every mocyon of hys sensualyte. What advayled at the begynnyng That Nature comytted me to hys servyce And charged me that byfore all thyng Of all hys gydyng I shuld take thenterpryse When he lusteth not to folow myne advyse But foloweth thappetytys of hys sensuall affeccyon As a brute best that lakketh reson? And yet not wythstandyng That he doth me dysdayn, I wyll resort to hym agayn And do my labour and bysy payn To assay yf I can hym refrayn Fro suche bestly lyvyng. But fyrst wyll I stande hereby In secrete maner to espy Some token of grace in hym wherby I may dyscerne and fynde That he hath any shamfastnes After hys great surfet and excesse, And yf yt be so, doubtles It shall content my mynde. Man cometh in [followed by Worldly Affeccyon.] Man I say, syrs, where ys Wurshyp, can ye tell? In thys place I left hym last. Worldly Affeccyon Syr, I warand you he ys occupyed well In ordeynyng your garmentys full fast. He departed fro me in great hast For that intent, and so he desyred That I wold tell you whan nede requyred. He shewed me hys mynde or he went, How he had devysed your garment. And yf yt be made after that intent As he told me, Whan ye were on that vestour, Every man shall do you honour As becummeth a man of your havyour, And so yt shuld be. Man Ye, but what wyll Reason say Whan he seeth me in that aray? Worldly Affeccyon Reason? Mary, let hym go play To the devyll of hell! Ye promysed me at the begynnyng That ye wold no more be under hys gydyng. Man No, but yet yt were accordyng To have therin hys counsell: Man wythout Reson ys but blynde, And yf I shuld speke after my mynde, I can well a dyfference fynde Bytwyxt man and a beste Whan he hath Reason in presence And duely obeyeth hys law and sentence. Worldly Affeccyon Why, have ye suche a spyced conscyence Now wythin your brest That chaungeth your mynde so sodenly? I am sory and ashamed truely On your behalf. Man No force, hardely! Thou ledest me all wrong, And therfore wyll I no more folow the. Worldly Affeccyon Not Worldly Affeccyon? Man N[o], parde, Nor yet thy brother Sensualyteâ I have folowed you to long. Worldly Affeccyon Is that your mynde? Man Ye, doubtles. And now wyll I seke Shamefastnes, By whom I trust I shall redresse All my mysded. Worldly Affeccyon And syth thou wylt nedys to Shame bowe, I pray God send the shame inow! And yet I trustâmake God avow!â Ones thou shalt have nede To call me agayn to thy servyce. [Worldly Affeccyon goes out.] Man Nay, nay, on warantyse! Now syrs, who can me advyse What ys best to do? [Shamfastnes comes in.] Shamfastnes Syr, yf ye lust to have myne acquayntaunce, I am redy to geve you attendaunce: Happely my servyce shall you advaunceâ I am called Shamfastnes. Man By your trouth, are ye the same? Shamfastnes Ye forsoth, that ys my name: Almys dedys I can attame And help for to represse. Whan ye have done offence or syn, Yf ye wyll mercy and grace wyn Wyth Shamefastnes ye must bygynâ Thys way must ye take. Man Ye be the man wythout faynyng That I wysshed for or ye cam here, And glad am I now of your comyng, Prayng you wyth hart entere Whan I have nede thus to com nere. Shamfastnes So wyll I do, ye may trust yt veryly: Whan soever ye call ye shall fynde me redy. He goeth out. [Reason comes forward.] Reason Syr, ys yt your mynde to do as ye say? Man Ye, that ys yt, as God me spede! Hard ye all thys mater? Ye or nay? Reason Yes, that I dyd in very ded. Man O gostly Reson, I have greter nede Of your help than ever I had byfore. Help me now and I shall never forsake you more. Syth I forsoke your cumpany I have commytted myche folyâ I am ashamed certaynly Whan I thynke theron. But now have I refused utterly All suche maner of cumpany And thys have I done veryly Of myne own mocyon. Reason Than my help shalbe redy as oft as ye me call. It ys my duety so for to do, And of your offencys wyll I make no rehersall, But what soever ye have done hyderto To me-ward, let yt passe and go. Agaynst God your offence ys great, Of the whych mater I wyll not longe treat. But thys confort of me ye shall have: Yf ye be contryte as ye pretend, God ys mercyable yf ye lust to crave. Call for grace and sone he wyll yt send, And be not in purpose hereafter to offend. Accustom your selfe in the wayes of vertue, And be not in doubt grace wyll ensue. Man Syr, yt ys my mynde and intent Hereafter to be your true obedyent, And never more to assent To suche foly agayn. Reason And upon that condycyon I take the unto my tuycyon, Wyth all hartys affeccyon, Never to part atwayn. And for thys seson Here we make an end, Lest we shuld offend Thys audyenceâas God defend!â It were not to be don! Ye shall understand neverthelesse That there ys myche more of thys processe, Wherein we shall do our besynes And our true endevure To shew yt unto you after our guyse, Whan my lord shall so devyseâ It shalbe at hys pleasure. Thus endeth the fyrst parte.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Second Parte Reason and Man come in. Reason I assemble the lyfe of mortall creature To the assyege agayn a strong town or castell In whyche there ys myche besy endevure, Myche warly polycy wyth dylygent travayll On every syde whyche parte shall prevayll By sleyght of ingyns or by strong power That other to subdue and bryng into daunger. In suche case and maner of condycyon Is wreched Man here in thys lyfe erthly Whyle he abydeth wythin the garyson Of the frayll carcas and carynouse body, Whom to impugn laboreth incessantly The World, the Fleshe, the Enemyâthese threâ Hym to subdue and bryng into captyvyte. And for to shew you what wyse they us impugn, Fyrst doth the World geve us an allectyfe To covet ryches and worldly renown, Wyth other vanyteys that be used in thys lyfe. Next that our Fleshe, whyche ever ys in stryfe Agayn our spyryte, doth provoke and excyte Us to accomplyshe our sensuall appetyte. The last of all ys our great Enemy, Whyche ever hath us in contynuall haterede Of old enkankred malyce and envy That he oweth to us and all the kynrede Of all the aunceters of whom we do succede, Nor yet cesseth hys malyce unto thys day Us to endaunger in all that he can or may. And certes these our sayd enemyes Be of theyre nature so myghty and so strong That hard yt wyll be for us in any wyse Agayn them warre or batayll to underfong. Also our garisons and fortresse to mayntayn long Agayn theyre ingens wythout spyrytuall grace We can not performe in no maner case. Wherfore yt ys to us ryght behovable Besyly to pray to God that ys immortall, Besechyng hym as he ys mercyable To have compassyon and pytye on us all And not to suffer us any wyse to fall Into suche foly and utter myschaunce As shuld theym greve and do dysplesaunce. Also yt behoveth on our parte To fle all suche maner of occasyon As may us put in fere and jeoparde Of theyre dyspleasure in any condycyon. New fanglenes and other nyce invencyon We must forsake in all maner wyse And acquaynt us wyth theyre contraryse: Quia contraria contrariis curantur, etc. I tell thys tale, syr, to you, Trustyng that yt be not done in wast. Ye remember as I suppose well inow How yt ys not fully thre dayes past Syth ye me promysed and bound yt fast From that day forth to be obedyent Unto my counsell and advysement. Man Ye syr, so I dyd in very ded, And yet yt ys my mynde and intent To folow the same, have ye no drede. Reason Yf ye do nat, your selfe shall repent. Now fare ye well, for I must be absent As for a season, and for your confort, Whan so ever ye call me I shall to you resort. Then he goeth out and Sensualyte cometh in. Sensualyte God forbed that ever he com agayn! Jesu, how may ye thys lyfe endure? Me semeth yt shuld be to you a great payn, Syth ye be of good complexyon and nature, To forbere the worldly sport and pleasure As ye have done now a great seson, And all by the folyshe counsell of Reson! Where ys your lusty hart bycom That served you so well thys other day? Now so helpe me God and halydom, I have great marvell how ye may Lyve in suche mysery, and thys dare I say: Wythout ye take some other wayes, By my trouth yt wyll shorten your dayes! And though I say yt, that were pyte, For by Cryste, and ye were gone, Meny a good felow wold make great mone. Then he wepyth. Man Why wepe ye so? Sensualyte Let me alone, It wyll none other wyse be! And ye saw the sorowfull countenaunce Of my cumpany, your old acquayntaunce, That they make For your sake, I dare say ye wold mone theym in your mynde. They be so lovyng and so kynde That I am sure Yf ye endure In thys pevyshe opynyon, It wyll be theyre confessyon! There ys none other remedy But for sorow they shall dye. Man Nay, God forbed they shuld so do! Sensualyte In fayth, wythout ye help therto There ys none other way. Man I wyll help yt in all that I may And I wyst by what mene. Sensualyte Mary, call theym to your cumpany! Man By Saynt Johan I am content, For I may say here to the, Syth I forsoke my lyberte And dyd to Reson assent, I had never mery day But lyved under awe and drede alway, Nothyng to myne intent. Another whyle I wyll me dysport And to myne old cumpany resort. Sensualyte O than shall ye theym confort And your selfe also! Wote ye who wyll be very glad? Man Who? Sensualyte Margery. Man Why, was she sad? Sensualyte Ye by the masse, she was stark mad Even for very wo Whan she hard tell of thys chaunce. And bycause she wold lyve in penaunce Her sorow for to quenche, She hath entred into a relygyouse place At the Grene Frerys hereby. Man Ye, hase? Alak, good lytell wenche! Is yt an house of strayt relygyon? Sensualyte Ye, as any that ever was bygon Syth the world stode. Man Be they close nonnes as other be? Sensualyte Close, quod a? Nay, nay, parde, That gyse were not good!â Ye must beware of that gere. Nay, all ys open that they do there, As open as a gose eye. Man And cometh any man into theyre sellys? Sensualyte Ye, ye, God forbede ellys, It ys fre for every body! And bysyde all thys, they be Ex omni gente cogniteâ No nacyon they forsake Wythout yt be beggars goyng by the way That have never a peny to pay For that that they do take. And yet can I beggars thyder lede Where they shall for lumpes of brede Satysfye theyre desyre! Suche drabbes some there be That requyre none other fe Nor yet any other hyre. Man Be they not wedded as other folke be? Sensualyte Wedded, quod a? No, so mot I the, They wyll not tary therfore! They can wed theym selfe alone: âCom kys me Johan.â âGramercy Jone.â Thys wed they ever more. And yt ys the more to comend, For yf the woman hap to offend As yt ys theyre gyse, A man may let her aloneâwyth sorow!â And wed a nother hore on the morow Even of the same wyse. Man Forsoth, thys ys a noble relygyon! It styrreth me to great devocyon For to se that place. Canst thou bryng me thyder well inow? Sensualyte Ye, and yt were myd nyght, I make God avow, As dark as ever yt was! Man But where ys Bodely Lust now? Then cometh in Bodyly Lust, [and] wyth hym Worldly Affeccyon. Bodyly Lust Mary syr, I have sytten and sought you Thys thre or four howrys. Man I make God avow, Ye gyve shrewd attendaunce! All thys two dayes I coulde not the espy. Bodyly Lust Syr, ye know well that ye and I Be never myche asonder Albe yt I be from you among. Man And now me semeth thou hast taryed to long, Whyche ys to me great wonder. Bodyly Lust Wonder? Ye parde, for an howr or twaynâ Forth for a passyng whyle and com agayn! Here ys a sore mater. Whan was I so long absent as now? And yet I was for to seke you At the tother syde of the waterâ The place that ye wot of parde: Understande ye what I mene? Man Ye, ye! Bodyly Lust Tell me in myne ere. Man Quid est Latinum propter le stewys? Bodyly Lust What? Laten? Now thys of the new ys! I herd never thys ereâ I trow ye begyn to waxe shamfast! Man Nay, nay, hardely, that gere ys past Meny dayes agon. I am as wanton as ever I was! Bodyly Lust It were almes to hang you ellysâby the masse!â By the hard necke bon. But wyll ye now go wyth me to a place And I shall shew you the smorterst face That ever ye saw wyth eyes? Man What thyng ys yt, yong or old? Bodyly Lust What ever yt be, yt ys able to be sold. It shall lyke you on the best wyse. Man For my love, let us some nyght be there At a banket or a rere supper And get us some wanton mete, So we may have some deynty thyng! Yet wold I spende twenty shyllyng Where so ever I yt get. Bodyly Lust Nay, nay, wyll ye spende a copell of crownes? And there shall no gentylman in thys ten townes Be better served than ye, Nor be receyved more honestly As to an house of bawdry For a banket or a jonkry For a dyshe two or thre. Man Yes, that wyll I spend wyth all myne hart. Bodyly Lust By your leve, I wyll depart To make redy thys gere. Man What now, in all thys hast? Bodyly Lust Ye, for God syr, I am agast That other knaves wyll come theder Byfore us and take up all. Man Se thereto I pray the! Bodyly Lust So I shall, Ellys fye on all together! Then goeth he out. Worldly Affeccyon Now wyll Margery make great mone Bycause ye com not. Man Ye, let her alone! I am not her bond man parde: She hath dysappoynted me or now. Worldly Affeccyon Yet on my fayth syr, and I were as you, At the leste I wold excuse me. Send her word that ye in no wyse May thys nyght kepe her promyse, And yf ye do not so, She wyll so morn that as I thynk Of all thys nyght she wyll slepe no wynk, She shalbe so full of wo. Man Ye, on my parell, take no care! Thys answere wyll I deffar and spare Tyll I be certayn What answere Bodyly Lust shall bryng Of thys other praty new thyng Whan he cometh agayne. Worldly Affeccyon Wyll yt please you that I go to Mergery In your stede? Man Mary, that were mery! Woldyst thou serve me so? Worldly Affeccyon Why syr, by my trouth, I mene but well. Man Ye, what thou menyst I can not tell, But that shall thou not do! Worldly Affeccyon In good fayth syr, ye may do wurs, For whyle I have any thyng in my purs Or any peny to spend, I wyll make her even suche chere As I wold myne own wyfe yf she were here, Ellys God defend! Man Ye, I thanke the for thy good wyll! But as for that chere, kepe yt styll Tyll I call theron. Worldly Affeccyon By God syr, for good love I spake yt! And now that I se ye wyll not take yt, I shall let yt alone. [Bodyly Lust comes in.] Man How now? Hast thou bene yender away? Bodyly Lust Ye syr. Man Et que novellys? Bodyly Lust Je nesceyâ I could not speke wyth her No[r] wyth none of her folkys. Man Not wyth one? Bodyly Lust No, they be aslepe everychone All that ever dwell there. Man How knowest thou wether they be aslepe or no? Bodyly Lust Mary, she her selfe told me so Whan I rapped at the dore. Man It semeth she was not aslepe than. Bodyly Lust No, she was abed wyth a strange man. Man A myschefe on her, hore! I wold this fyre wer in her tayll, I make God avow! Bodyly Lust That nedeth notâshe ys hote inow! It were more almes to get Some cold water her fyre to quenche. I tell you, yt ys as warm a wenche As any in all thys strete. I supposed I had angred her yll. Man How so? Bodyly Lust For I rang her a knyll That waked her from her slepe. I gave her a pele for her frendys soulysâ A man myght have hard the noys from Poulys To the farthest ende of Chepe. She saw that I wold not seace but knok And rap styll at the gate. She opened a wyndow and put forth her hed: âHens, forty pens!â quod she, âJak Noble ys abed: Thys nyght ye come to late!â âA, ha! Standeth the wynd so cold?â quod I. âKa, cue-tytle, we have a bry! Thys gere goeth all wyde!â And so I cam thens a great pace Tyll I cam hyder. Lo, thys ys the case. Have I not well hyde? Man Well man, there ys no more to do: That we can not have, we must forgoâ There ys none other remedy. Lo Worldly Affeccyon, now mayst thou se Thy counsell was nought that thou gavest me. Worldly Affeccyon No more yt was, truely. Man Ye, I told the as myche byfore: It ys good to be sure ever more. Therfore now let us go And resorte agayn to our old hostesâ That ys the best way now as I gesse. Worldly Affeccyon Ye hardely, do so. Then they thre [and Sensualyte] go out and Pryde cometh in. Pryde Syrs, remember ye that thys other day Man promysed me even in thys stede That I shuld wyth hym dwell? And now I here say The wylde worm ys com into hys hed So that by Reason only he ys led! It may well be so, but I am sure That Reason shall not alway wyth hym endure. Me thynketh that Sensualyte doth not hys parte Accordyng to the duety of hys offyce, For no body can better torn a mannys hart Nor yet a redyer mean devyse To put away suche folyshe fantasyse Than Sensualyte yf he lust to assay, For he ys chyef ruler whan Reason ys away. [Sensualyte comes in.] Sensualyte Ye, a ruler wyll I be though Reason say nay. Pryde Ah Sensualyte, welcom by thys day! What tydyngys? Good? Sensualyte Ye, by my fay, As good as can be told: I have brought thys Man to hys old gyse. Pryde Hast thou so? Sensualyte Ye, on warantyse. Pryde Now forsoth, I gyve the pryk and pryseâ Thou art worth thy weyght of gold! Of thys tydyngys I am glad and fayn, But shall I be welcom to hym agayn And all our cumpany? Sensualyte Ye hardely, As welcom as ever ye ware byfore. Pryde Goddys blessyng have thyn hart therfore! Thus am I in thy det more and more. Sensualyte Japes! Why say ye so? Pryde For I speke yt after my myndeâ Thou art to me alway so kynde. But where shall I our mayster fynde? To hym wyll I go. Sensualyte He ys besyâharke in your ere!â Wyth lytell Margery, ye wote where! And as sone as I had brought hym there I cam my way apace, And bycause he shuld not be alone, I left wyth hym Worldly Affeccyon, And other erand had I none Now to thys place But even to shew you what ys done. And from hens I must anone For to seke an other companyon To gyve attendaunce. Pryde Who ys that? Sensualyte Mary, Glotony. Our mayster calleth for hym besyly! Sawyst thou hym not? Pryde No certaynly, To my remembraunce. Sensualyte I must go seeke hym wythout any taryeng. But Pryde, I warn you of one thyng Whyle I thynk theron: Whan my mayster and ye shall mete, In any wyse se that ye hym grete In the old fassyon, And make as though ye know nothyng Of hys dyvers and varyable dealyngâ Kepe that in your brest. Ye can not do hym more dyspleasure Than therof to make reporture. Therfore let yt rest: To speke therof yt ys hygh treson. Then he goeth out. Pryde I am glad ye warn me thus in seson! I shalbe the better ware: By thys warnyng I shalbe wyse And do as ye me advertyseâ Take therof no care. [Slouth comes in.] Slouth Wyll ye be wyse, quod a? Mary, that ys a thyng! By God, ye had nede to have better warnyng Or ye bryng that about! Pryde What, brother Slouth? Fro whens comyst thou? Slouth Streyght fro my bed, I make God avow! Myne eyes be almost out For lak of slepe. But thys syr to you! Me thought ye called me Slouth ryght nowâ Pece, no more of that. I have a new name as well as ye. Pryde What ys that? Ease? Slouth Ye parde, But yt forceth not Whyle our mayster ys not present. Bytwene us twayn, I am content, Call me what ye wyll. But where ys our mayster? Pryde Wotest thou nere? Slouth No. Pryde No more do I. Slouth There, there, there, Thou shalt dwell wyth me styllâ Thou art as good a wayter as I. Pryde I shrew the better of us both hardely! But surely we do not well: We shall not contynue wyth yonder Man But we awayte better now and than. Therfore by my counsell, Let us twayn go together To seeke our mayster. Slouth But wotyst thou whether We shall now go To fynde our mayster? Pryde I shall assay. Thou shalt se me gesse the way And happely fynde hym to. Now must I to the stewes as fast as I may To fech thys gentylman!âBut syrs, I say, [To audience.] Can any man here tell me the way?â For I cam never there. Ye know the way, parde, of old! I pray the tell me, whyche way shall I hold? Wyll ye se thys horson cocold? I trow he can not here! Now yt were almes to clap the on the crown! Then cometh in Man and Worldly Affeccyon. Man Why, be there any cocoldys in town? Pryde Ye, I durst hold theron my gown That there be a score! But for God, I cry you mercy, For by my fayth I wyst you not so ny! Had I wyst yt, I ensure you faythfully That word I wold have forbore. Man No force hardely, yt toucheth not me! But Wurshyp, tell me, where have ye be? Me thynketh long syth I you se. Pryde Syr, yt ys no marvell, Bad ye not me the last day To go purvey for your aray, And ye remember well? Man Ye for God, have ye done the same? Pryde Ye by the rode, ellys were I to blame. All thyng ys redyâin payn of shame!â Ellys I quyte me yll. The tayler told me yester nyght That all your garmentys were redy dyght. Wyll ye go thyder and have a syght? Man Ye mary, wyth a good wyll. Slouth Wyll ye that I go wyth you also? Man I wote never whether ye may attend therto, For ye do nothyng But even after your own swete wyll. Slouth Why, shuld I ever wayt? Nay, that I nyll For to be a kyng! I may not endure contynuall besynesâ I was never used therto, doubtles. I shuld not lyve a yere Yf I folowed you, I am sure. Ye styr and labour out of mesureâ I saw never your pere! Ye wene there can nothyng be do But yf ye put your hand therto, And iwys that ys no nede. Ye have servauntys that be true and just, Yf yt wold lyke you to put theym in trust And quyte well theyre mede. What shuld I attend you for to please Whan I se well ye set by none ease Whyche belongeth to me? Man Why Ease, what meaneth the thus to say? I do but ete, drynk, slepe, and play, And none other labour parde. Slouth Ye, ye may say what ye wyll, But I can never se you ydell And quyete as ye shuld beâ Your body laboreth as doth an hakney That bareth the burdon every day That pytye yt ys to se. And your mynde, on that other syde, Is never idell nor unoccupyedâ Iwys yt greveth me To se you demeaned that wyse. I trow ye be set all on covetyse! Man Covetyse? Nay, let be, It ys a thyng of greter cure That stycketh in my mynde, be thou sure! Slouth So me thought, by the rode! I wyst as myche there was som thyng By your lowryng chere and your syghyng That was not all thyng good. But what ys the mater, I pray you hartely? Man Iwys, thou canst not devyse the remedy Wyth all the wyt thou hast. But thys ys the case, to tell yt shortely: A thyng was told me as I cam hereby How Reason purvayth fast And maketh very great labour and ordynaunce To dashe us all out of countenaunce, And for that purpose He hath gadred a great cumpany. Slouth What to do? Man I wote nere, I, But as I suppose It ys to bryng me in captyvyte And to take fro me my lyberteâ So he hath oft sayd. Pryde Fere ye that mater? Man Nay, never a dell! But I care for yt, wyt ye well. Yet am I not afrayd, For I wyll wythstand yt proudly. And, syrs, I trust ye wyll stand therby Whan yt shalbe nede. Pryde Ye, by the way that God went! Or he have of you hys intent, Fyrst shall I blede The best blode that ys in thys carcas. Man Well Ease, go thy way hens a pace And make therin good spede. Call my cumpany all togeder And byd theym every man com heder That ys wyth me affeed. Slouth Mary syr, that shalbe do. Then he goeth out. Man Wurshyp, in the mean tyme let us go To se my new apparell. Pryde Wyll ye so? Now for your ladyes sake, Go do yt on you, and I undertake It shall becom you well. Man Worldly Affeccyon, abyde thou here, For I wyll go do on thys new gere As Wurshyp doth me counsell. Then Man and Pryde goeth out. Worldly Affeccyon Mary, I shall wyth all myne hart: Thys good fyre and I wyll not depart! For very cold myne handys do smartâ It maketh me wo-bygon! Get me a stole! Here, may ye not se? [To audience.] Or ellys a chayr! Wyll yt not be? Thou pyld knave, I speke to the! How long shall I stande? [Glotony comes in.] Glotony Let hym stand, wyth a foule evyll! A stole or a chayr, quod a? Get hym the devyll! Wyll ye se? Lo, every drevyll Now adayes, I warand, Must commaund as he were a kyng. Let hym stande on hys fete, wyth bredyng! Worldly Affeccyon What, Glotony? I can tell the one thyng: In fayth, you wyll be shent. Glotony Why? Worldly Affeccyon My mayster hath sent Sensualyte To seke the all about the contre. Spakest thou not wyth hym? Glotony Yes parde, I know all hys intent, And thereuppon I am com here For to awayt. But wotest thou where Our mayster ys now? Worldly Affeccyon Nay, I wote nere. I am not very certayn, But Pryde and he together be gon. He sayd he wold com agayn anon Wythin an howr or twayn. Tary thou here and go not awayâ I wyll go breke my fast and I may, For I ete never a morsell thys day. Then he goeth out. Glotony Mary, that ys a thyng! Go whan thou wylt! I wyll abyde. My stomak he shall not rule or gyde That ys now fastyng! Nay, of all thynge erthly I hate to fast. Four tymes a day I make repast, Or thryse as I suppose, And whan I am well fed Than get I me to a soft bed My body to repose. There take I a nap or twayn, Up I go streyght and to yt agayn! Though nature be not redy, Yet have I some mete of delyte For to provoke thappetyte And make the stomak gredy. After all thys, nedys I must Somtyme folow the wanton lust: It foloweth naturally, For hote drynkys and delycate refeccyon Causeth flesshely insurreccyonâ Ye know yt as well as I. [Man enters, dressed as a gallant; Bodyly Lust accompanies him.] Man Trouth, as ye say I know yt well. Glotony What gentylman ys thys? Can ye tell? Bodyly Lust Wotyst thou never? Glotony No, by the bell, I saw hym never byfore. Bodyly Lust Is yt our mayster? Glotony Nay, by the rood, It ys not heâwoldyst thou make me wood? Man Yes, I am the same! Glotony I cry you mercy! I se yt well now! Byfore I knew you not, I make God avow, In ernest nor in game. Man Why? Bycause I have chaunged myne aray? Glotony For that cause, trow ye? Nay, nay, That ys not the thyng That can dysceyve me, be ye sure! But I pray you, who hath had you in cure Syth my last departyng? Man By my fayth, a lytell season I folowed the counsell and dyet of Reason. Glotony There went the hare away! Hys dyet, quod a? Yt may be veryly, For ye be haltred marvelouslyâ Altred I wold say! Alas the whyle, had ye no mete As long as ye were under hys dyet? Man Mete? Yes, I had som, Wythout yt were on fastyng dayes: Than he wythdrew my supper alwayes And gave me never a crom. Glotony No force hardely! Why wold ye than Favor hym as ye dyd, lyke a mad man? Ye loke now as yt were a gost: Had ye dwelt wyth hym tyll thys day, Ye had bene pyned even away As ye be now almost. Your fleshe ys gon every dell! A vengeaunce on the morsell That ys left theron! Bodyly Lust Now talk of the remedy. Glotony Mary, now must he ete and drynke fastâ Other remedy ys there none. Bodyly Lust Ye, but where ys the mete now, let us se? Glotony Ye are passyng hasty, benedicite! Fyrst must ye go Where as provysyon therof ys made: Let us go thyder and yt shalbe had. Man But what ys the maysters of the inâ A weddyd woman or a vyrgyn? Glotony Neyther of both iwys. Bodyly Lust No, but for a mayden she goth. Glotony Ye, for God, that she doth, But yet she ys none, by Jys! Bodyly Lust No? No? What than? Glotony Iwys, I not, but as men clater They say she ys innupta materâ Hardely, an holy woman. Man Well, thyder we wyll. Go we hens! Bodyly Lust Syr, ye wyll gyve me lycence To sport me for a season? Man Yes, for a whyle: ye, well inow. But go not out of the way I charge you, For hyder wyll come anone All my cumpany as I suppose. Kepe theym together, for I purpose To come agayn anone And shew theym my mynde what I wyll do. Then he goeth out [with Glotony.] Bodyly Lust Mary, I shall do what I can thereto, And yet yt ys hard for me To kepe theym together any whyle. But I shall tell you what: I had lever kepe as many flese Or wyld hares in an opyn lese As undertake that! [Wrath comes in, armed for battle.] Wrath Where be these knaves that make thys aray? Bodyly Lust Mary, they be gon that other way. Tell me whome ye meane! Wrath I trow thou scornyst. Bodyly Lust Nay, certaynly! How so be yt, yf I shuld not ly, At the fyrst blushe, I ensure you faythfully, I had forgot you clene Bycause ye be thus defensybly arayd. What meaneth that? Are ye affrayd? Who hath you greved? Wrath Nay, I fere no man that bereth an hed! Yet had I lever that I were dede Than that shuld be preved. Bodyly Lust By my fayth, ye are wont to be as bold As yt were a lyon of Cottyswold! But now to my questyon: What meaneth all thys defensyble aray? Wrath Mary, Slouth warned us two thys same day, Even syth yt was none, That our mayster and Reason shuld make a fray, And therfore he bad us wythout delay To awayt on our capytayn. Bodyly Lust A, now I know the mater ryght well, But what shall com therof I can not tellâ It passeth my brayn! Our mayster wylled that we twayn Shuld tary here tyll he com agayn. [Envy comes in.] Envy What wylt thou do than? Bodyly Lust Who, I? Nay, care not for meâ I wyll not com where strokys be: I am not so mad a man! And iwys, yt ys not for any fere, But yt ys a thyng that I can well forbere And wyll as long as I can. Of lust and pleasure ys all my myndeâ It longeth to me of properte and kynde. And yf I shuld to the warre And ly in myne harnes as other men do Wyth hunger and thurst a day or two, It shuld me utterly marre. Envy It were a great losse yf thou were mard! Now fy on the, stark horson coward! By cokkys precyouse blode, It were no syn to sle suche a knave! Hast not thou wagys as other men have And few of us so good, Yet wylt thou fayll us at thys nede? Now who so ever shall quyte my mede, I wyll no further go Tyll I have slayn hym myne own hand Though I shuld forswere the land Even whan I have do. Then goeth out Bodyly Lust. Hold hym in syrs, I you requyre! [To audience.] Alas, wold ye not at my desyre Do so myche for me? Iwys, yt wold have done me more good To have sene the knaves hart blode Than twenty shyllyngys of fee! [Man comes in.] Man What how, syrs, what meaneth thys gere? Wyll ye sle eche other here? No more of thys worke! Envy By the hart of God, and he had abyden A lytell whyle, he shuld never have spoken Wyth preste nor wyth clarke. Man Who was that? Envy Your own mynyon, Bodyly Lust. Man Why, what hath he done? Envy Even lyke a lurden He sayth that ye have gyven hym lycence To abyde at home and kepe resydence Whyle we bere the burden And serve you now at your nede. Man He prayde me so in very dede! Wythin these two dayes He sayd he wold serve me wyth a good wyll, But of the warrys he could no skyll Nor knew therof the wayes. How be yt, I gave hym therof none answere. Envy No, but I am sure he wyll not com there. And now may ye se That no man ys so myche to blame As your selfe. Man I? Envy Ye, by Saynt Jame, No man but even ye! For I am well assured of one thyng: Ye gave hym better clothyng Than ye dyd me, And better wagys and fees also! And though I sayd but lytell thereto But suffered ever more, Yet I dysdaynd yt ever in my mynde, And though[t] that ye were to me unkynde To set so great store By suche a knave as he was. I wold I had hym here, by the masse, And no man but we twayn! Man By my trouth, thys ys ever thy guyse: Loke by whom I set any pryse, Hym thou wylt most dysdayn! Wrath By Cryst, he can do none other wyse! But now syr, ys there any servyce That ye wyll commaunde me? Man Ye mary ys there, but my cumpany Dresseth theym forward passyng slowly: I trow yt wyll not be. Manhode, thou art good inow, for one. Wrath Ye by Cryst, and they cam everychone, I wyll not gretly fere. Envy By my trouth, bycause he sayth so, I shall tell you what I saw hym doâ I was present there. Syr, yt happyned in Westmynster Hall Even byfore the juges all: Hys handys were bound fast, And never upon hym that ever God made Dager, sword, nor knyfe he had, And yet at the last He drave twelve men into a corner And an howr after durst they not appere! How say ye hereto? And hys handys had bene at lyberte, He wold have put theym in great jeopardeâ It ys to suppose so. Man Mary, there he quyte hym well! But where be myne other folk, can ye tell? Then cometh in Glotony wyth a chese and a botell. Wrath Mary, here cometh oneâ Good Felyshyp me semeth yt shuld be. Glotony Syrs, God spede you! Man What tydyngys wyth the? Glotony I shall tell you anone Had I set adone my gere. Mary syr, I am com here For to attende uppon you: We shall a warfare, yt ys told me. Man Ye, where ys thy harnes? Glotony Mary, here may ye se: Here ys harnes inow. Wrath Why, hast thou none other harnes but thys? Glotony What the devyll harnes shuld I mys Wythout yt be a botell? A nother botell I wyll go purvey Lest that drynk be scarce in the way Or happely none to sell. Wrath Thou must have other harnes than thys, man! Glotony Other harnes? Nay, I shrew me than! I can no skyll theron! Why, trowest thou that I wyll fyght? Envy Ye, so I trow. Glotony Nay, by God almyght, Therof wyll I none! I was never wont to that gere. But I may serve to be a vyteler, And therof shall ye have store, So that I may stand out of daunger Of gon shot. But I wyll com no nere, I warn you that byfore. Envy Now, suche a knave I betake to the devyll! Thys ys even suche a nother drevyll As was here whyle ere: They be two knaves annoynted! I fere me, syr, ye shalbe dysappoynted: I lyke not thys gere. Glotony O, I had forgoten, I make God avow! Syr, my felow Ease commaundeth me to you. Man Commaundeth the to me? Glotony You to me. Man Me to the? Glotony Commaundeth you to hym I wold have sayd. Man Why cometh he not hyder? Glotony By God, for he ys afrayd And lyeth syk in hys bed. He toke such a conseyt whan he hard of thys gere That for thought and very fere I wene he wyll be dede. Wrath And he were hanged, yt were no rek! I pray God the devyll breke hys nek And all suche as he ys! Man Well, let us suffer for a whyle. I wyll go walke hens halfe a myle, And for all thys Happely all thys gere shall not nede, How be yt that I dout and drede The wurst as wyse men do. Manhode, com thy selfe wyth me. Glotony And I to, syr? Man Ye parde, Woldyst thou be prayd thereto. Than goeth out Man, Glotony, and Wrath. Envy Now he that wold have warre or stryfe, I pray God send hym a shrewd wyfe, And than shall he have inow! But I shall tell you, syrs, as for me I am none of theym, so mot I the! I may say to you I wyll no suche rekennyngys abyde! Goddys body, here cometh Pryde As crank as a pecok! As sone as he and I mete, Wythout he stand ryght uppon hys fete He shall bere me a proude mok. [Pryde comes in.] Pryde What tydyngys, syrs? Can any man tell? Envy Ye mary, that can I do as well As any that was in feld. Ye have taryed so long about your gay gere That the feld ys done or ye come there. Pryde Done? Mary, God sheld! Envy It ys done wythout fayll, But whyche of theym hath wone the batayll I can not tell you certayn. Pryde Thou were not there, yt semeth therby. Envy Not I there, quod a? Yes hardely, And that to my grete payn! But as sone as the batellys joyned togeder I cam my way streyght heder For to tell tydyngys. Pryde What the devyll tydyngys canst thou tell? Envy Mary, I can shew you nothyng of the batell, But of many other tydyngys: Ye are out of conceyt, I tell you, for ever, Bycause ye dyd not you endevoure At thys great vyageâ In so myche that ye are lyke to lees Both your offyce and all your fees And put clene out of wagys. Pryde That ys not true as I suppose! Envy Syr, and yt be not, take my nose And my hed also! Your offyce was gyven or I cam thens. Pryde Mary, that was a very short sentence, And I not called therto! Now Envy, what counsell wylt thou gyve me? Envy By my trouth, Prydeâthou mayst byleve meâ If I were in thy case I wold wythdrawe me for a season: Though yt be nother felony nor treason Nor yet wylfull trespace, Yet the s[h]ame ys wurst of all, For every knave wyll the call A coward to thy face! Pryde I am unhappy, I se yt well, For thexpense of myne apparell Towardys this vyage, What in horses and other aray, Hath compelled me for to lay All my land to morgage. And now, whan I have all do, To lesse myne offyce and fees also For my true intent! I may say that all my cost And all my tyme ys evyll lost In servyce that I have spent! Well, what so ever bytyde me, For a season I wyll hyde me After thy counsell. And syth yt wyll no better be, Fare well! I take my leve of the. [Pryde goes out.] Envy Now gentyll Pryde, fare well! Alas, that I had no good felow here To bere me cumpany and laugh at thys gere! Thys game was well founde! [Sensualyte comes in.] Sensualyte Yes, and ye lust to play the knave, Some maner of cumpany ye myght have Here wythin thys grounde. Envy Some I can thynke, yong or old, And ellys yt were a small houshold As any myght be found. Sensualyte It ys not small, the company sheweth well. But me thought thou were about to tell Of some mery jeste Or som mery game at my cummyng. Envy Ye hardely, yt ys a game for a kyng Whan he lusteth best To laugh for hys dysporte and solace! Syr, I shall tell the! Thys ys the case: Ryght now as I stode In thys place, and never a man wyth me, In cam Pryde garnyshed as yt had be One of the ryall blode. It greved me to se hym so well besene, But I have abated hys corage clene For a lytell season. By the rode, I have gyven hym a chek mate! For I bare hym on hand that he cam to late, And that the feld was done, And how hys offyce was gyven away Bycause he fayled our mayster that day. I made hym to byleve so, And whan I had told hym all thys tale, Anone he began to wax all pale, Full of care and wo, And now he hydeth hym selfe for shame. I gave hym myne advyse to the same, And so he ys gon. Sensualyte Now on my fayth, thys was madly do! But in fayth, what moveth the therto? Envy Mary, cause had I none But only that yt ys my guyse: Whan I se an other man aryse Or fare better than I, Than must I chafe and fret for yre And ymagyn wyth all my desyre To dystroy hym utterly. But now in ernest, Sensualyte, Tell me whan thys fray shalbe, I pray the hartely. Sensualyte What? Agaynst Reason? Envy Ye, the same. Sensualyte Tushe, they be agreed, in payn of shame, And good cumpany they kepe. Envy Agreed, quod a? In the mare name, Mary syr, that were a game To make some of us wepe! Sensualyte Wepe or laugh man, so yt ys! And who, trow ye, ys the causer of thys? Envy Who? Sensualyte Age, the devyll hym quell! Envy Why, ys Age now com in place? Sensualyte Ye, and that may ye spy by hys face And ye mark yt well. Hys stomak faynteth every day, Hys bak croketh, hys hed waxeth gray, Hys nose droppeth among, Hys lust ys gone and all hys lykyng: I se yt well by every thyng He may not lyve long, And all maketh Age as I sayd byforeâ He ys the doar! And what trow ye more Thys Age hath done. Envy What? Sensualyte By my fayth, he hath brought in Reason In suche wyse that at no season Nothyng can be wrought But Reason must be called therto! I fere me he wyll us all undo Wythin few dayes! As sone as Glotony had espyde All thys gere, he wold not abyde But went even hys wayes. Our mayster prayed hym to tary a season. âNay, nayâ, quod he, ânow have I done, I may no lengar tary, For Age and I may not togeder dwell.â And streyght way he departed fayre and well. Bodyly Lust stode by And saw that Glotony wold nedys be gon. âHave wyth the, Glotonyâ, quod he anon, âFor I must go wyth the!ââ So that two be gon togeder! Cam there none of theym both heder? Envy Never a one that I se. Sensualyte Well, they be gon some other way To get a new mayster as sone as they mayâ They can not be onpurveyd. And as sone as they two were gon Our mayster sent for Covetyse anon And hartely hym prayd To awayt on hym well for a yere or two, And he hath promysed hym so to do As for a yere or twaynâ But Reason may not therof know. Envy Reason, quod a? No, so I trow, He wyll that dysdayn! But where hath Covetyse ben many a day? Sensualyte He dwelled wyth a prest, as I herd say, For he loveth well Men of the chyrche, and they hym also, And lawyars eke whan they may tend therto Wyll folow hys counsell. Envy So men say there as I dwell. But Sensualyte, canst thou tell Now in thys case What were best for us to do? Sensualyte Mary, I hold yt best that we go Hereby to som place And semble togeder all our cumpany To here there myndys by and by And every mannys opynyon What shalbe best for to do. Envy By my trouth, and be yt so, I hold yt well don. Than they go forth and Reason and Man com in. Reason Syr, I have oft tymes you advysed To lyve vertuously and shewd you the way, And that not wythstandyng, ye have me dyspysed And folowed Sensualyte meny a day. Wyll ye so contynue, ye or nay? If ever ye purpose your selfe to amend It ys tyme, for your lyfe draweth fast to thend. Man I can not contynue though I wold, For Age hath wayned me clene therfro. And yet, Reason, whan ye me told Of thys gere meny day ago I thought lytell I shuld have com herto, But had of your wordys great scorn and dysdayn. Wold God that my lyfe were to bygyn agayn! Reason Speke not therof, that may not be! A thyng don can not be called agayn. But the thyng that most fereth me On your behalveâI tell you playnâ Is that ye wold in no wyse abstayn From synfull lustys as I wylled you to do Tyll now that Age compelleth you therto. Man That ys full trew wythout faynyng! As long as myne appetyte dyd endure I folowed my lustys in every thyng, Whyche now by the course and law of Nature And not of my polycy or good endevoure Is taken fro me for ever more, And so can I deserve no mede therfore. But not wythstandyng thys myne abusyon, I trust that by the help of your good advyse I may be made the chyld of salvacyon. Reason Yes, and ye wyll syr, on warantyse, So that ye utterly forsake and dyspyse All your old servauntys in wyll and dede And do by my counsell. Man Yes, have ye no drede. Reason Than my soule for yours I lay to wed, Ye shall do well, have ye no mystrust. And fyrst, to begyn wyth, I you forbed All maner of dyspeyre. And secundly, ye must Put to your mynd and good wyll To be recured of your great excesse, For wythout your helpe yt can not be, doubtles, As in thys example: yf so be the pacyent Of hym selfe be wyllyng to have any remedy, It ys a great furtheraunce to that intent So that to the preceptys of physyk he apply. And who so doth the contrary, no marvayll truely Though he myskary. What shuld I bryng Any mo examples for so playn a thyng? Man It shalbe no nede as in thys case. I know ryght well what ye meane therby, And that wyll I folow, by Godds grace. Reason Than as I told you, yt shalbe no maystry Your selfe to confort and to have good remedy Agaynst the great surfettys that thou hast don, By whyche thou hast deserved endles dampnacyon. But do as I shall tell the and have no drede, And for to gyve the medycyns most accordyng Ayens thy sores, do by my rede: Loke what dysease ys hote and brennyng, Take ever suche a medycyn as ys cold in werkyng, So that the contrary in all maner of wyse Must hele hys contrary, as physyk doth devyse. Ryght so, who so lusteth fro syn to aryse, Where he hath in pryde done any offence, He can be holpen therof none other wyse But onely by mekenes that ys the recompence. Agayn wreth and envy take charyte and pacyence. Take almes dede agayn the syn of covetyse, And to represse glotyny acquaynt the wyth abstynence. Agayn foull lust of body take chastyte and contynence. Myche syn groweth by slouth and by idelnes, And that must be eschewed by mene of good besynes. Lo, thys be preparatyfys most soverayn Agaynst thy sores whyche be mortall Onles that thys medycyns to theym be layn. Whan thou hast receyved these preparatyfys all, I wyll com agayn yf thou me call And order the further after my mynde. Man Ye, but where shall I these preparatyfys fynde? Reason Thou shalt theym fynde wythin thyn own brest: Of the yt must com, yt must be thy dede, For voluntary sacrafyce pleaseth God best. Thou canst not therof have help or mede But yf thys gere of thyn own hart procede. Man Well, I shall endevoure me to the uttermost, And tyll I have found theym I shall never rest. But how shall I know theym? That wote I nere! I pray you shew me that byfore your departyng. Reason It nedeth not therof to enquere, Thou shalt know theym at the fyrst metyng. Of two contrarys there ys but one lernyng: That ys to say, whan thou knowyst well that on, The other contrary ys knowen anon. Then he goeth out and Mekenes cometh in. Mekenes Who so woteth hystoryes of scrypture well Shall fynde that for pryde and presumpcyon Lucyfer, whyche somtyme was a gloryouse angell, For that hys offence had suche correccyon That both he and eke meny a legyon Of hys order was cast down to hell By ryghtfull justyce perpetually there to dwell. Remember also Adam, the fyrst of our lyne, What payn he sufferd for pryde and dysobedyence. Causeth he not a great decay and ruyne In all the progeny for the same offence In suche wyse that he and all that were borne sence Be utterly dysheryted and put fro paradyse?â And so we be made thrall unto syn and vyce. And lost shuld we be all of very justyce Ne had be that God of hys mercyfull goodnes Dyd us sone after wyth hys own blode maynpryce And us redemed fro paynes endles, So that we do not dysobay or transgresse Hys hygh commaundementys but demean us well After hys lawes whyle we here dwell. And for as myche as mannys nature Is frayll and lyghtly to syn wyll assent Eyther of purpose or onwetyng peradventure, There the sayd good Lord hath hym sent Agayn every syn a remedy convenyent, For he ne wold have one soule to be lore Whom he hath dere bought, as I sayd byfore. The rote of all syn ys Pryde, ye know well, Whyche ys myne adversary in all that he may. Where I am in place he may not dwell: Hys malycyouse power I can ryght well alay And teche every creature the remedy and way How to subdue Pryde, whyche no man can do Wythout that I, Mekenesse, must help therto. Man Than your help and counsell ys necessary to me, Wherof I pray you wyth all hartys affeccyon. Mekenes All redy at hand, who so ever yt be That lusteth to have me for hys consolacyon. Man I my selfe have synned in pryde and elacyon! Shew me your counsell: what way shall I take A dew satysfaccyon for that syn to make? Mekenes Thou must byfore all thyng set lytell pryse By thyne own selfe, and take no hede Whether the people do the prayse or dyspyse. Be thou meke in hart, in word, and in dede. Thynk not that thou woldyst any man overlede. Be soft and lowly in speche to every wyght, And use none aray that staryng ys to syght. Lo, in these thre thyngys onely standeth pryde, If thou commyt the lest of theym thre. Man Fro thys day forth I wyll set theym asyde And folow the counsell that ye gyve me. Mekenes Do so, and I wyll clerely dyscharge the. As for the syn of pryde, my soule for thyn, Thou shalt be all hole yf thou take thys medycyn. Than he goeth out. Man Yes, I shall take yt: thynk not the contrary! Now am I well eased! Yet have I not done all. [Charyte comes in.] Charyte There ys no lyvyng physycyon ne potecary That can devyse so soverayn cordyall Agayn the sore of envy, whyche ys mortall! No man lyvyng, I you ensure, Wythout my helpe may undertake that cure. For I am called Charyte, the salve for that sekenes, Whom thappostyll Paule commaundyth syngulerly In dyvers hys epystellys. I can well represse The rancour of envy and gyve therein good remedy. Man Than ys your counsell to me full necessary. If ye be Charyte, ye are bound doubtles To have som compassyon of your neyghbours dystres. Charyte Why, hast thou ben envyouse byfore thys day? Man Yes, as God knoweth well, and that I rew sore. Charyte Well, thys must be the remedy, mark what I say: There ys no syn that dyspleaseth God more Than doth thys syn of envy, and therfore, If so be thou wylt thyn own soule savegard, Be thou never envyouse fro thys day forward. Also that syn ys to man onnaturall More than any other in myne opynyon, For all other synnesâmark therin wellâ A man commyttyth wyth som delectacyon. But Envy ys ever full of payn and passyon And tormenteth hym selve wyth sorowfull sadnes Whan he seeth hys neyghbours prosperyte or gladnes. He ys never glad nor taketh any solace But at hys neyghbours harme, losse, or hevynes. He speketh somtyme fayre byfore a mannys face, And yet wythin hys hart he ys full of doublenes, For byhynd hys bak he wyll never sease Wyth sclaunderouse wordys to appayre his good name, And many a fals ly doth he report for the same. Ye know, syr, whether yt be thus or no. But now a nother whyle to speke of remedyâ If ye wyll be holpen, syr, thus must ye do: Fyrst, byfore all thyngys love God entyerly. Next that, thy neyghbour love as thyne own body. That ys to say, thou must the to hym behave And do hym such curtesy as thou woldyst of hym have. Observe these two thyngys and do no more In recompense of thy great trespace Touchyng the syn of envy rehersed byfore. Man To observe theym well God send me hys grace, And I thank you for your confort and counsell in thys case. I shall my selfe endevoure accordyng therto. Charyte God send the hys grace well so to do. Then he goeth out. [Pacyence comes in.] Pacyence The remedy of wreth and outragyouse yre Must nedys com of me and none other wyse, For I am called Pacyence, whyche quencheth the fyre And flammys of wreth. Yt ys also my gyse By soft wordys and sufferaunce to overcom myn enemys. Man Now welcom, Pacyence, for whom I have sought: Help me with your counsell, for his love that all wrought. Pacyence Thys ys my counsell: yf thou wylt wythstand Thy gostly enemy and thys temptacyon, Thou must have me, Pacyence, ever redy at hand, Specyally in sufferyng of worldly trybulacyon. Remember how Cryst dyd in tyme of hys passyon: There mayst thou lern how to be pacyent In any adversyte that to the shalbe sent. And yet there may be no comparyson Bytwyxt the leste part of hys payn And the gretest wrong that to the can be don. Wherfore thou wreth shuldyst not dysdayn, But gladly thou shuldyst thy selfe refrayn From yrefull passyons as I sayd byfore, Syth thou shalt have a reward in heven therfore. Man It ys my full mynde and intent Hereafter to do as ye me advertyse. Pacyence Now he that all goodnes to us hath sent, Send you hys grace to demean you that wyse. Then he goeth out. Man I shall do my good wyll, on warantyse. Now who can me best dyrecte My slouthfull idelnes for to correct? [Good Occupacyon comes in.] Good Occupacyon The syn of slouth I can well represse, And I shall teche the to do the same. Man How shuld I do yt? Good Occupacyon By mean of me, Good Besynes, And so am I called for that ys my name. Idelnes ys never wythout syn or blame: By mean therof myche syn cometh in, For yt ys the very moder and maysters of syn. In eschewyng therof thou must ever use Som good occupacyon in body or mynde. And yf thou do thys my counsell refuse So that the devyll in idelnes the fynde, Than accordyng to hys propertye and kynde He laboreth fast by mean of temptacyon To bryng thy soule unto endles dampnacyon. Therfore do som good occupacyon alway As well wyth the body as wyth mynde inward, And yf thou do not thys counsell obay Thou shalt thyn own soule gretely enjobard. On that other syde, thou mayst be no coward Nor ferefull of penaunce or other good dede, Syth thou shalt be sure to have heven to thy mede. Man Thys counsell ys good, I thank you therforeâ My mynde ys well eased, therein be ye sure. Good Occupacyon Is there any thyng ellys that I can do more? Man None, to my knowledge, for ye have done your cure. Good Occupacyon Se that ye wysely now put in ure. Then he goeth out. Man Yes hardely, thynk not the contrary, Syth yt ys to me so behovefull and necessary. [Lyberalyte comes in.] Lyberalyte I am Lyberalyte, the vertu cardynall By whom ys confounded the syn of avaryce. Who so ever lusteth on me to call, I am redy therin to gyve mynde advyse. Man Syr, I pray you in my most harty wyse, Helpe to reforme and order my mynde, For the syn of avaryce hath made me full blynde. Lyberalyte Fyrst thou must be sory for the abusyng Of temporall goodys byfore thys day. Next that, I wyll advyse the byfore all thyng, If thou hast wrongfully taken away Any mannys good, go wythout delay And therof to thy power make due restytucyon, For erst shalt thou have of thy syn no remyssyon. Man Why, trowe ye that I shall not be excused By almes dede of that offense? Lyberalyte No, no, hardely, thou art gretely abused! Thynk not therby to make recompence, For by that almes thou doyst great offense And dyspleasure to God. Man Why say ye so? Cryst hym selfe bad that we shuld almes do. Lyberalyte Ye, for God, but that shuld be do Of well goten goodys, ellys ys yt nought. Man Well, I assent gladly thertoâ As in that one poynt I am fully taught. Wyt ys nothyng worth tyll yt be dere bought! But what other amendys shall I make The foull syn of avaryce to swage and aslake? Lyberalyte Thou must have compassyon and also be lyberall Unto thy neyghbour at hys necessyte. Man I trow ye wold have me to gyve away all And leve my selfe nought! Lyberalyte I mene not so parde, For that ys wast and synfull prodygalyte. Take the myd way bytwyxt theym two, And fle thextremytees how so ever thou do. Thou must thy worldly goodys so employ In charytable dedys wyth due compassyon, That thou mayst bye everlastynge joy For the good intent of that dystrybucyon. Thou mayst also gyve theym to thy dampnacyon, As whan thou doyst yt to wyn therby Praysyng of the people or som other vayn glory. For trust yt well, thou must geve a rekenyng Of all the goodys that com to thyn use. The hygh juge that knoweth all thyng, To whom thou shalt thy selfe accuse Wythout any appele or fayned excuse, He wyll be thyn audytour in thys case, Fro whom thou canst not hyde thy face. There shalt thou openly shew and confesse How that goodys cam to thy possessyon, What mynde and pleasure thou hadyst in ryches, And why thou hadyst therin suche affeccyon, What almes dede or other good dystrybucyon, Or how thou hast these goodys wasted or abusedâ There yt shalbe knowen, yt can not be refused. Than, as I sayd to the byfore, Thou shalt receyve after thy deservyng Joy or ellys payn to endure ever more. Man Truely thys ys a ferefull thyng. Lyberalyte Therfore remember well my sayeng, Mark well my counsell, and folow the same. Man If I dyd not, I were gretely to blame. Then Lyberalyte goeth out and Abstynence and Chastyte com in. Abstynence The remedy of glotony I can well techeâ I am ordeyned onely for that intent. Man And I have great nede of suche a leche: Your counsell to me ys ryght expedyent. Abstynence Syr, yf ye lust to be my pacyent And take suche remedy as I shall devyse, I shall make you hole of that syn, on warantyse. Man What ys your name? Abstynence My name ys Abstynence, And thys other that cometh wyth me Is called Chastyte or ellys Contynence. It ys hys gyse and hys properte To folow me where so ever I be Lykewyse as lychery, that dedely sore, Foloweth the bestly syn of glotony evermore: Quia delitie sunt instrumenta voluptatis. But now to do that I cam forâ Agayn the syn of glotony the remedy ys thys: Use scarcer dyet than thou dyddyst byfore, Beware of superfluyte and surfet ever more, Take no more than suffyceth nature, Nor of delycate mete set thou no store. Now have I sayd all that longeth to my cure. Chastyte And I must nedys conferme hys sayeng, For as he rehersed now ryght well, Gluttyng of hote metys and delycate fedyng Causeth synfull lustys in a man to swell. And over that, thys ys my counsell: Eschew idelnes byfore all thyng If thou wylt be chast and clene of lyvyng. Fle also the cumpany and the occasyon Of that syn, whyche ys dampnable: As sone as thou felest any temptacyon, Put yt clene away by meanes covenable. Of all other synnys yt ys most abhomynable And sonest wyll thy soule endaunger and blame, There be so many great synnys annexed to the same. If thou lyst not for fere of dampnacyon Thys syn to forbere, than on that other syde Do yt for love of thyn own salvacyon: Thynk what rewardys in heven doth the abyde Whyche yf thou lyve chast can not be denyde. My wyt suffyseth not to tell and expresse What joy thou shalt have for thy chast clennes. Man I thank you both for your advyse, And now wold I speke wyth Repentaunce fayn. Abstynence I can bryng you to hym on the best wyse. Man Than wyll I awayt uppon you twayn, And after that I wyll com hyder agayn, Trustyng that God wyll send me the grace To comfort my soule wyth gostly solace. Than they [all three] go out and Reason comyth in. Reason I here say, to my great joy and gladnes, That accordyng to my counsell and advyse Thys mortall creature doth well hys besynes To correct and forsake all hys old vyce, And that he ys in good way and lykely to aryse From the vale of syn whyche ys full of derknes Toward the contemplacyon of lyght that ys endles. Lo syrs, are not we all myche behold To our Maker for hys great pacyence, Whyche not wythstandyng our synnes manyfold Wherein we dayly do to hym offence, Yet of hys mercyfull and great magnyfycence He doth not punyshe as sone as we offende But suffereth in hope that we wyll amend. He suffereth a synner sometyme to endure A long lyfe in honour and great prosperyte: It ys a thyng that dayly ys put in ure, And meny a great daunger escapeth he Where good men perysheâthys may ye seâ And all bycause that he wold hym wyn And have hym to tourne and forsake hys syn. [Man comes in.] O, here cometh he that I loke fore: Syr, have ye done as I wylled you to do? Man Ye, that have I don, and what trow ye more? I have ben wyth Repentaunce also, Whyche fro my hart shall never go, For he brought me unto Confessyon, And anon I was acquaynted with Hartys Contrycyon. They advysed and charged me to do satysfaccyon, And so have I don to my best power. Reason Than art thou fully the chyld of salvacyon! Have good perseveraunce, and be not in fere: Thy gostly enemy can put the in no daunger, And greter reward thou shalt therfore wyn Than he that never in hys lyfe dyd syn. And to thentent that thou mayst well Persever and contynue in thys sure way, Or we depart hens, by my counsell, Let us by one accord togeder syng and pray Wyth as humble devocyon as we can or may That we may have grace from syn thus to ryse As often as we fall, and let us pray thys wyse. Then they syng some goodly ballet.</field>
