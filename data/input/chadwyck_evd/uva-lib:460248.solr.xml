      <field name="fulltext">THE SLIGHTED MAID, A COMEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Illustrious Prince, JAMES Duke of MONMOUTH, &amp;c. Knight of the most Noble Order of the GARTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE TO THE KING. If Favours merit Thanks, what then is due For Blessings, Sir, deriv'd to Us from You? Such Blessings as no People, ever since They prosper'd into Kingdoms, ow'd a Prince: Three Nations (by all other disesteem'd) To Honour and to Freedom you redeem'd. Now your Nobility are Lords age'n, Your Commonalty Valiant Loyal Men. Th'Oil that Anointed you heal'd our sad wounds, Your Laws have fix'd us in our old just Bounds. When to your Throne you came, Justice return'd From Heav'n, and on the Bench (o're which she mourn'd,) Sits in your Splendour, gives (not takes) the Word, And with her Ballance over-rules the Sword, Which now protects your poorest Subject's Plea, And guards the Labours of your Land and Sea. Nor is Toil barr'd from Pleasure any more, For, Publick Recreations you restore; Not Roman Theatres, that were design'd For Sword-play; our Plays recreate the Mind, Instruct the Judgment, which Mens Nature learns, And how to manage Low and High Concerns: Our whole Globe in this Hemisphere we see Inlightne with the Raies of Majesty. Where all, but th'Authors doubtful Eye, looks clear, But, Sir, he hopes you'l smile away his fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE TO THE HOUSE. Your looks are eager, Gentlemen; new Plays, Like our new Beauties, expectation raise So high, you promise to your selves a Feast Of Wonders; alas, Miracles are ceas'd: No working now by Supernatural means, Beaumont and Fletcher have writ their last Scenes: No Johnson's Art, no Shakespear's wit in Nature: For, Men are shrunk in Brain as well as Stature. Little pure Wit is stirring, (I confess;) And that's cri'd down by those that have much less; And some by the Fanaticks have been taught To conclude, All Gentlemen do, is naught. When those Grave Criticks in their Cradles lay, Good Plays grew faster than ill Weeds, than they: Now, one would think, that our slow Writers play'd A Spanish Mate at Chess, for Draughts are made, Since meer Gambetters kept the Stage in aw, For, (whoe'r sets the Men) they give the Law, Tyrannically, to our cost we know it, For (Right or wrong) they judge against the Poet. From such (whom Spleen and Prejudice transport) Th'Author refers himself to this just Court, These Noble Ladies, Lords, and Gentlemen, And humbly at your feet he lays his Pen: If bad, it shall not write another Letter; If't please, he'l take it up, and please you better. Incourag'd Poets heighten their Designes, Like Painters, who at first draw ruder Lines.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Filomarini, Gioseppe, and Peralta. Per. Come, come; as sure as I am in my wits, My Lord Filomarini, you are mad: You would not go to Sea else at your years. Fil. To Sea? no, if I do, let me be drown'd. [to Gioseppe. Per. Are you so old, you've liv'd past sense of danger? Fil. I've lived past th'age of telling him my secrets. Per. Or so poor, that Need makes you trust your life To Planks and Billows? Fil. Is my Wine aboord? Gios. 'Tis stow'd, and all your Goods. Per. All your Discretion, That's stow'd too; your Grave Wisdom's under Hatches, Princess Diacelia's Guardian wants a Guardian. Fil. Princess Leandra wants a Guardian; This Pirate little thinks she's landed here, And that my Voyage ends in her Arrival. Per. Turn Child again? now, when you have invited All Naples to a Feast, you'l not stay dinner; Pray, do but eat your breakfast with your friends. Fil. But is Leandra grown the greater beauty My son's Bride, Diacelia, was the sweeter. Gios. Your Lordship knew Leandra in her childhood, You'l see her finely built, so tite, so yare; She lacks but you at Helm. Fil. And I can Steer. I shall keep her from falling foul upon Lugo Filomarini. Where the Devil Did my Son Lugo meet her? Gios. Where the Devil Never appear'd before so near an Angel, At Church, with the Greek Cheather cursed Mother, That passes here for an Illustrious Lady; The Vice-Roy heard she was a Grecian Princess. Per. Was ever a Vagary so well tim'd? This morning, when your Son is to reap here The Harvest which you sow'd in the Isle of Candy, To marry a young Princess; you are going To solace your cold body with the Mermaids. Fil. To Princess Diacelia be a Traitor! On's Wedding-Eve fall in love with Leandra! Gios. At th'Altar: down he fell upon his knees, And would have pray'd to Her, but that I whisper'd, Take heed, Sir, how you set up a new Saint, He that kneels there is an Inquisitor; This frighted him from Superstition; But then he fell to Witchcraft, with th'Impostress Her Mother, the Greek Devil, made a Compact, That is, a Bargain, for twelve thousand Pistols, And struck a March. Fil. Hey boy! how sits the Wind? Gios. Fore-right, and a brisk Gale. Per. There's such a wind In your head; my good Lord, you hear not me. Fil. Why did they not marry upon the place? Gios. Because the Greek Leech holds it proper first To purge your son, and Bleed him in the Purse: She'l first be sure of his twelve thousand Pistols. Fil. Captain Peralta, there's not such a wind In my head, but I hear thee, and know, all Thou sai'st is nothing; answer'd in a word (The little Word, that governs the great World) Int'rest; advantage calls me, I'm concern'd To leave my Son on's Wedding-day, no less Than he to complement his Guests, or kiss His Bride, and I will do't as heartily. Enter Lugo. Per. Answer your Son so, he's here (I have prest. Your father's Stay, to make him go his Voiage, [to Lugo He'l sail, near fear'r) break my Lord Lugo's heart; Fil. Hold up thy head, boy; I may come again, But if it be my Destiny to sink, I leave thee' a Fortune to buoy up thy heart. I leave thee' a Bride to multiply my Honor. Lug. There's two good Fortunes. Fil. And the third's not ill, I leave thee' a Friend, my old Camrade in Candy; This Spanish Captain, to draw his Sword for thee; Embrace him, he's experienc'd, take his counsel; Take heed he cheat not; if a Spaniard got him in his Ear, 'Twas on a Gipsie, for he lives by Pillage, in his Ear, The Trade that set him up was Pyracy; Had the Rogue been a Neopolitan, (He's stout and subtile) he'd have made a rare Bandite. Lug. You would make a rare Gally-slave, [aside. For you can Look one way and Row another. The Captain may be needful, when I quarrel. Fil. Use him, but trust thy self. So, farewel Naples. No further, son, my blessing: I have bless'd Th'Excellent Princess Diacelia, Thy Bride, be worthy of her; and remember, Remember, Sirra, that her Ancestors Were Soveraign Princes; and (although I am Her Guardian, yet) that I impos'd not thee Upon her, but thou art her own free choice; Remember how thou wert oblig'd, when she Refus'd my Nephew, the Prince of Salerno. Per. You'l give me leave to wait you to the Port? Fil. To cut thee off, I draw a line, this River Of Rubicon no Soldier is to pass. Exeunt Fil. &amp; Gios. Lug. No talking to th'old man; is he not drunk? Per. He may be so, he took care for his Wine. Lug. More than he did for me; I'd rather be My Father's Sack or Claret, than his Son, He's better at chusing of Wines than Brides. Per. He chose, for you, a Princess. Lugo. But 'twas I That should have chosen for my self. O Captain! I would have took Leandra in her Smock, Rather than marri'd Princess Diacelia With all Bulgaria', had she't in possession. My Father shews his judgment. Per. He was thought (Ere he ran Sea-mad) wise. Lug. Yes, for himself; Like an unnatural Moor, he would take money Ev'n for the chaining of his son to th'Oar: But, Captain, thou hast promis'd to redeem me From the worst of all Slaveries, a loath'd Marriage. Per. I use not to redeem, but to sell Slaves. Would I could make a Bargain for his Lordship. [aside. My Lord, I hope to serve you [such a trick As yet you never saw] but the contrivance Must be consider'd in a place more private. Enter Salerno and Iberio. See, the Prince of Salerno and his Friend My Lord Iberio, who commands the Forces Design'd for Candy. Lug. By their whispering, It seems, they would be private too; leave them The house, we'l take a turn or two i'th' Garden, My Bride is not yet dress'd, there's time enough. Exeunt Lugo &amp; Peralta. Iber. She is the mostâ Sal. Inconstant, you would say: Speak softlier. Iber. Why not lowder? 'tis a truth. Sal. But, friend, all truths are not to be proclaim'd. Prethee, my Lord Iberio, do not vex Thy self, because a Woman proves a Woman: Be thou a Man, laugh, as I do. Iber. You may Have cause to laugh. Sal. Thou hast almost as much, For, our two Cases differ, like two Clocks, About some half an hour; thy Mistress comes From the Church marri'd, mine's going to be marri'd, I give her. Iber. Pish, you cannot, if you lov'd her. Sal. Special Considerations moving us, I lov'd her for her Person, she was handsom; I lov'd her for her Fortune, she was Rich; I lov'd her for her Title, though the Turk Usurps her Country of Bulgaria, Still she's a Princess: Princess of Salerno I wish'd her, but my cousin Lugo had The preference; and since I must not be Her Husband, I'le e'n be her Reverend Father, And give her. VVhat think'st thou of my Resolve? Iber. I think, there's ne'r a Prince in Italy Better than you are, at digesting Willow. Sal. Willow feeds me fat, I'm a kind of Kid, I feel my self so game-some after it, So wanton: now am I for Mistresses, Mistresses in abundance. Iber. One's too much. Sal. The Enemy to my Bulgarian Love, He that unthron'd her Crown'd Progenitors, The Great Turk, keeps not Mistresses enow: A Mistress, Sir, may be your fairest play, For it is possible, she may be your Mistress, That would not be your Wife. Iber. Impossible, I'l never see her more. Sal. What will you lay? Enter Arviedo. Your Cousin can resolve us, he has made it His business to inquire. Where's Pyramena? Arv. She's in the House. Iber. In this House, Arviedo? Arv. Her Husband told me, she was going hither: And when his Highness lighted from his Coach, Her Chair was carri'd in. Sal. A Plot! she marri'd So early, to meet thee, and make Proposals: But she will lose her Time, and I my Sport, If the Bride be not hasten'd. Exit Salerno. Iber. I would make The Prince no sport, but that I have ingag'd To dine here. Arv. Better you would dine at home, For, Pyramena's husband, Decio, Arm'd with Gold, that puts Confidence in Cow'rds, Offers to every wanting hand a Bribe To poyson you. Iber. Decio poison me? Thy kind fear thinks (now he has marry'd her I should have had) that he must with my life Secure his Purchase. Arv. He attempted me. Iber. Do not I know, he loves to droll with thee? Arv. He would scarce droll away the Sum he offer'd. Iber. To thee? my kinsman, one that I bred up? Arv. He urg'd my Obligation and Relation As the best Blinds, told me, that I might act In his revenge, and make my self a Fortune, Like a destructive Mountebank, that thrives By Poyson, first takes Money, then takes Lives. Iber. In Rhime? but he's an Illustrissimo Of Venice and Parnassus, a rich Poet: Would thou hadst took his Money. Arv. And given you The Poyson? sure I sooner should have drunk it. Sal. I dare be sworn thou would'st. Aav. And can you wish Such Faith corrupted? Sal. No, my noble Cousin, 'Tis to prevent a Rogue that might be hir'd, That I wish thee employ'd. Arv. On that account, I'l take his Gold, and undertake your Murder; To serve your Lordship I'l be any thing, Your Pois'ner to preserve you. Sal. Were he bold, I might suspect, that Decio would revenge His Sister Ericina. Arv. She that dy'd For love of you. Sal. But from so soft a spirit I apprehend no danger, howe'r sound him. Exit Arviedo. Enter Salerno, Diacelia, Pyramena, and Attendants. Sal. Well, Princess Diacelia, my first Love, Although you make your unseen Guest, my Heart, A Mourner at your Wedding; yet those Joys From which you banish me, I wish to you. Dia. In the Prince of Salerno's Arms I wish A better Wife. Sal. Bar curses; no Wife, Madam, Mistresses what you please. Dia. Fie, fie, Sir, leave This Raillerie. Sal. Leave you your frowning then; Learn of your Senior Bride there, how to smile Pyram. smiles on Iberio. On a condemn'd pris'ner of Love. He frowns? Abominable! frown when his Mistress smiles? Pardon my zeal, Madam, I hope my Friend May have a Mistress. Dia. Not of Pyramena; She's Virtuous, tak't upon my word. Sal. Nay, now That I have the word of a Princess for Her Virtue, I'l ingage my Friend to try it. He Sings. Thy Love is Chast, they tell thee so; But how, young Soldier, shalt thou know? Do by her As by thy Sword, Take no Friend's word, But try her: 'Twill raise her Honour one step higher. Fame has her Trial at Love's Bar, Deifi'd Venus from a Star Shoots her Lustre: She had never been Goddess't, If Mars had been modest: Try and trust her. Dia. What a strange wild-brain'd husband have I scap'd! Iber. You think, I take this for a current smile, I know 'tis counterfeit, gilt brass, your Face Puts mirth on, when your Conscience is tormented. Py. My conscience? Iber. Have you none? or is't a-sleep? It shall be wak'd, I'l thunder. Py. If Heav'n thunder'd I should not tremble, for I am not guilty. Iber. Then you'are not marri'd? Py. I am Wife to Decio, No Lord, but equal to a Lord of Naples, A Gentleman of Venice. When will't thunder? I see no Lightning yet. Iber. The Clap comes now, (Avoid it, if you can) did you not swear You would be my Wife? Py. Did not you swear first, That you would not be jealous? were ye not? Fell you not out with me, for visiting My Kindred? then I marri'd: Where's my crime? 'Tis you that should fear Thunder, you are perjur'd, You broke th'Oath upon which my Oath was built, And Superstructures always fall to ground, When their Foundation sinks. Can you deny it? Iber. Mine was not Jealousie, but Tenderness Of your Repute: 'tis a censorious Clime We live in; from the Liberty you took, I fear'd a popular Scandal on your Honor. Py. It seems so, by th'Insolence of your Language; Did you not tell me, that the world would say Iberio was a fool to venture her To common Courtship, that was Vow'd to himâ Sal. This makes for me, if Vows have past between them; May not Iberio court his own Wife, Madam? [to Dia. Iber. And would you leave me for a hasty word? Py. Yes, he that would controll me when my Servant, Would tyrannize when he should be my Husband. I have one that Vows he never will commit Your Jealous Sin against my Innocence. But I forgive you; something too I'l give you, My self I cannot, you have forfeited Your Right in me, but I'l create a Title For you, next Husband, you shall be my Friend. Sal. Did not I tell thee? [to Iberio. Enter Gioseppe disguised, he gives a Letter to Diacelia. Py. If your Lordship please To taste the First-fruit of my Bridal Board Sal. And Bed. Ah Rogue, wrapt in thy Mothers Smock. Py. You shall be the Bride's guest. Iber. I won't. Sal. Out Clown. Dia. Honest old friend Gioseppe, I dare say, My Guardian, my Lord Filomarini, Is misinform'd; for grant that his son Lugo Had no Love for me, yet for his own Honor, Now we are going to Church to be married, He'd not fly off. Gio. But when you see the proof; Your Highness (as your Guardian directs) Will be pleas'd to put on the Spanish Veil, And go with me. Dia. He writes, that, by your means, He has preferr'd himself and me for Servants. To the Greek Cheat, your Mistress. I'l obey him. Gio. Pray send for me, I'l wait at your Back-stairs. [Exit Gioseppe. Py. My Husband is a Stranger, a Venetian, (For when I found you jealous, I resolv'd Never to have a Neopolitan,) But he so loves your Town, he'l dwell with you: And sure you cannot but love him again, The goodest man, nothing but innocent mirth, His whole delight is to make Songs and Masks; I hope you'l come? Iber. If I do, I'l tell Decio What an inviting Wife he has. Py. Your Servant. Enter Lugo and Peralta. Lug. Sir, my dear Love, my good Lord, noble Lady, Please to excuse me, that I have thus long Defer'd the Ceremony of the Day, I stay'd for this slow Friend: let's now to Church. Per. No haste: I was your Friend more than mine own, Or else I would not have ingag'd with you (For such a vast sum) to the Jews. Iber. Ingage? Pirates ingage? will Jew trust Free-booters? Per. My Bill's protested, and my Credit lost, By your neglect of Payment at your Day, And I come not to give you Lordship Joy, But to renounce the name of Friend to one That has so publickly renounc'd his Honor. Lug. Good angry Captain, Soldiers should not be Judges of Lovers if you come to th'Honor Of being a Bridegroom, you will never think. Of transitory things. When I am marri'd, Il satisfie the Jews. Per. Satisfie me, In point of Reputation. [You are out. [aside. Y'are out: seem mov'd; answer, Is that the business?] Lug. Is that the business? You have reason, Captain: Before the Priest joyn our hands, I'l dispatch thee: My dear, once more excuse me, if you pardon Th'adjournment of our Marriage, my Friends will; Indeed they would not pardon me, if I Preferr'd the Law of Hospitality Before the Rule of Honor. Follow, Captain. [Exeunt Lugo &amp; Peralta. Sal. Your colour changes, Madam? use my service. Dia. Pardon me, that I decline company, Till my Lord comes back. Sal. Your obedient Servant. [aside. Dia. Now I perceive my Guardian's a great Prophet. Exit Diacelia. Py. This is the second time that I'm inforc'd To give you over for th'Infirmity You suckt from Nature, Jealousie; yet once You had some colour, but now no pretence, For, you are Jealous of another's Wife. [Exit Pyramena. Sal. Deny another's Wife? Art thou a Man? Iber. Not such a man as the Prince of Salerno; You are for serving Mistresses, But I Serve Christendom against th'Incroaching Turk, And so, our cross-designs must sever us. Sal. A cross-grain'd Dunce thou art, and so I leave thee. Enter Arviedo. Iber. Stay, here my Cousin Arviedo's news, Though there be not a Mistress in the Case; Did thou or I ghess right? Arv. Your Lordship did; For Decio vows, that when he courted me To poison you, he meant you no more hurt Than I, when I accepted the imployment. Iber. What a Droll's this? Arv. I have a Drolling message, But more ridiculous. Sal. Better still, what is't? Arv. An Offer, such as man yet never made, He calls't a Kindness: Decio prays your Lordship, To think his House, and all within it, yours; Though all without it be not so much worth As one within it, and that is, his Wife. Sal. I vow a kindness. Arv. He acknowledges, She wrong'd you in her marriage, and that you, For her offence, might justly make your self A stranger to his Wife, but if you do, 'Twill grieve her, and her grief will break his heart. Sal. By his kind heart, who would not swear this fool Markt for thy Cuckold; wert thou not resolv'd Never to see his Wife? Iber. Who told you so? Sal. Thou. Iber. True, I did, but that was in my rage, When my hot fit was on me, now 'tis off, I'l dine with Decio. Arv. Will you? Iber. Will I live? I'm the Bride's guest. Arv. Your Highness is his friend, Pray, Sir, disswade him, interpose your pow'r. Iber. What now there is a Mistris in the Case? Arv. But there's a Man too, and a spleenfull Man, Decio's an Enemy. Sal. Decio's an Ass. Arv. Although he has a pretty innocent face, Decio is not the Fool you take him for; But would a Fool invite Him to his Wife, And mean less than a Murder? Sal. I'l secure All Avenues, he shall not be surpriz'd. Arv. You forget whose death Decio would revenge, Think of his Sister. [to Iberio. Iber. I think of his Wife. Arv. You ought to think of her as of a Syren, That sings but to intice you to a Rock. Iber. In those soft Rocks there is no danger, Cousin. Arv. I onely fear the danger of their Honors. [aside. Sal. Danger now there's a Mistris in the Case? Mark the word Mistris, does it not sound well? Iber. Sweeter (by far) than Arviedo's Lute. Sal. Or Trills of Nightingales. Iber. Or Canary-Birds, Whistling the Flajolet. Sal. Now, as friends should be, We are of one mind, and I will not leave thee; Never may he Plead more, that leaves his place At Bar, when there's a Mistris in the Case. [Exeunt.</field>

Thou think'st thou art a Lieutenant still, And tak'st me for thy Corporal? look thou To the Gate, I dare not, lest I be knockt, Their fingers are so furious. Cor. If the Lodge Be thus unquiet, such an Iron-mill, I'l turn our fine young Master, Decio, Out of my Service; hold, and let me see Who 'tis, that knocks so like a Gentleman. Enter Salerno, Iberio, and Arviedo. Cry' mercy, Sir; though I thought 'twas no Begger; I lookt not for a Prince. Sal. Iberio, go, [Exit Iberio. Mind thou thy Mistris; Fear is the best Spie, Thou, Arviedo, make discoveries. Arv. I have made one, Sir, Is not this the Soldier, That, when our men fell basely from th'Assault, Ralli'd them, beat the French, enter'd the Breach, And set upon the Bulwark the King's Colours? Sal. He serve a private man? Arv. Know'st thou the Prince? Cor. He has forgot me. Arv. Sure I have seen thy face? Cor. And this hand, Arviedo, better arm'd; Sal.

The times are chang'd, Sir, War into Peace, and Soldiers into Beggers, And, Sir, you know, Beggers must be no Chusers; If I might chuse my Office, I would be (Not Porter, but) Lieuetenant Corbulo, And in my hand I'd flourish Steel, not Silver.

I must drink to your inclinations Health upon Health; we hear, Sir, you are raising A Regiment of Mistresses; how fill Your Companies, how many do you Muster? Sal. I beat my Drums yet. Cor. March a thousand strong, I am for your first Mistress, a pitcht Battel, A fair Campania; War, Sir, glorious War Will dignifie your Title, raise your Fame. Sal. True, Corbulo, and ruine my Estate, Have we not President for that? what Fortune Has fam'd Gonsalvo, the great Captain, left To his Posterity? is not the young Heir Of that brave General's Family, Giulio, So poor, he dare not shew his face in Naples? Cor. But you know Generals Heirs who are great Lords. Sal. Why dost not thou fight to advance thy self? Now the Pope raises here a Regiment Comanded by my Lord Iberio. Go with my Friend to Candy and get Honor; Kill Turks, man, and the Signory of Venice Will make thee' a Knight of th'Order of St. Marc. Cor. Though I've got only wounds in the King's Service, I will not fight but by the King's command, And in a place of Honor and of Profit: But, Sir, your highness needs no Salary. Sal. I may, like th'Emperor Maximilian, Trail my Pike under an invincible King. Cor. Serve ours again, fight for the Crown of Spain, And I'l no longer serve a Foreiner. Sal. Wu't serve me, in thy Neopolitan Mistris? Cor. No; I keep her for my Venetian Master. Sal. It seems, thou hast a Charge of Chastity. Cor. One of the Warders in the Brazen Tower. Sal. That keep thy Dande safe from midnight Visits. Cor. I'l help your Highness to a handsomerâ Sal. Handsomer than thy Lady? Cor.

Hang her, she pleases neither High nor Low: But I am pleas'd to see thy care Lieutenant. Cor. True to my trust. Sal. For which (hold) there's more Gold. Cor. More Counsel I will give you for this Fee, Marry, and make me your Porter. Sal. Here's my handâ Cor. It is a liberal one, I kiss your Bounty. [Exit. Sal. I dare not trust this Soldier, there may be More of the Crew, he may command a Party: Let's seek Iberio out, and fetch him off. [Exeunt Salerno &amp; Arviedo. Enter Iberio and Pyramena. Py. You may praise my good Nature, you'l scarce match it In Naples; shew another of my Sex, That scorn'd like me, will slight the Injury, And welcome the Affronter; but you'r welcome To Decio's House, my Heart, and your old Love. Iber. But will you love me, may I ask, and hope? Py. I promise you any thing in my power. Iber. Will you then, doâ Py. Do what? Iber. It will not out; Do me the favour to shew me the House, Which seems to be like you, a Paradise. Py. The Building is much handsomer than I, But both are (equally) at your dispose: The Rooms of State your Lordship may see now, But 'twill be Dinner-time ere I can shew you The private Lodgings. Iber. On, sweet Madam, on. Enter Salerno. Sal. Iberio? stay. Iber. You will not offer it, Now she invites me? Sal. To thy ruine, fool: The Porter is Lieutenant Corbulo, The boldest Officer of all our Foot, Thou know'st him, he confesses, he takes Pay Of Decio for securing his fair Wife. Enter Arviedo hastily. Arv. Stand on your Guard, Decio has lin'd his House With Mariners out of the Turky-Ship, Which came from the Levant into the Harbour This morning. Iber. See the fruit of Mistresses. Arv. How much more noble would your death have been Had your blood smeer'd a Bashaw's Semiter? Then you had di'd upon the Bed of Honor. Py. He cannot have a Plot to murder you. Arv. Two hours since he had one to poison him; I heard the Word given now, it is, Fall on. Py. Your Forlorn I will be. Sal. Say'st thou me so? I shall love Mistresses better for thy sake. [within] Dec. Fall on. Salerno, Iberio, and Arviedo draw their Swords. Sal. Do, Rogues. Iber. We'l sell ourâhow? a Dance? Sailers and their wives Dance. Enter Decio and Vindex. Vin. What will you do? Dec. Villain, how dar'st thou ask? Justice I'l do, teach men how to slight Maids. Princes, the Turky-Ship thus speaks your welcome To my VVife's House, for I have neither House, Nor Land, nor Body, nor Soul, all's my Wife's, And (mark Poetick Prophecie) she'l be yours. Iber. My Wife? Dec. Your Wife. Sal. When, Decio? Dec. Let me see? All the men of my race di'd (punctually) At two and twenty, so that three years hence She's yours, if you've a stomach to her then, As ready as the Wedding-dinner now On my Wife's Table, your Wife that shall be Three years hence.

Quick, fellow-servants, set the Chairs, Gioseppe: My Ladi's little Dog has foul'd the Carpet, Perfume here, Princess Diacelia. Dia. Princess Diacelia? Fil. I shall say, Fritilla, For, to serve Diacelia and Leandra (As by a Guardian's duty bound) I have Unlorded my self and Unprincess'd thee, Granchild Fritilla, Daughter to my Son That's at Madrid, Mace-bearer to the King; But I defie the City of Madrid To match this Spanish Beauty. Dia. You are pleasant; But Guardian, I should say, Grand-father Draco, Why are we Spaniards? if you had still been My Lord Filomarini, your son Lugo Had marri'd me without dispute. Fil. No Grand-child, He had too great a passion for Leandra. Dia. Me-thinks, in your own shape you might have aw'd him. Fil. I should have sham'd him into Impudence If I had made a publick Business of it. Gio. Twelve thousand Pistols you had sav'd your son. Fil. Whate'r he loses, she shall not lose him, Nor shall my Nephew, the Prince of Salerno, That's mad for Mistresses, now want a Wife: I'l bring them about, Master, as the Wind Carries thy Sails, without appearing in't. Enter Leandra. Look where Leandra comes, your Bride-grooms Love. Dia. Let me embrace my Rival. Leandra lays her hand on Diacelia's breast. Lean. We'l not quarrel; Here sticks Love's Arrow with the golden head. My sullen heart is wounded with Dull Lead. Fil. But why alone, young Mistris? where's our Lady, Th'old Hag, your Mother? Lean. Talking with a Captain Sent from your Son. Fil. The Fool imploys the Pyrate. Lean. Yes to lay me aboard; I hope you'l fight him? Fil. My Nephew shall; for, the Prince of Salerno (If you can like him) must love you, I'l charm him With this Leandra' in little, this thy Picture Given me by a Witch (I mean, thy Mother) Shall melt him, (Liver, Lungs, Brain, Heart, and all) As if't were his own Picture, made in Wax, And stuck with Needles. Lean. When I see your Nephew, I'l tell you how I like him: 'tis the Man, And not the Prince, that I shall look upon. Fil. I see, thy humble humor is quite spent. Lean. I found my spirits when I found my friends, (Thanks to this Plot, my good Guide Gioseppe) But to your Lordship's Orders I submit. Fil. Yet a while seem obedient to th'old Woman. Enter Menanthe and Peralta. She comes, the Pirate after her. Me. Wait here, to Peralta, (who in his hand has a small Coronet and knot of Diamonds.) Till I despatch these to their several duties. Hosepe, we are pleas'd with these new Servants Of thy commending, once again you're welcom. they bow to her. Draco, do what you undertake to do, Shew the young Prince, (who cries up Mistresses) Leandra's Picture, try how much he'l offer, Lugo's twelve thousand Pistols must not buy her. [Filomarini bows, and goes off. Hosepe, take you, from the Captain's man, Those Turky-Vests sent us by my Lord Lugo. [Gioseppe bows, and departs. Fritilla, chuse you out the richest Vest, And fit it to Leandra: Mignion, look That you obey my Maid in point of Dress; [Diacelia and Leandra make low Courtsies. And heark you! trifle not your time away; Your Lord will come straight: do y'hear? put on Patches. [Leandra still makes Courtsies down to the ground. [Exeunt Leandra &amp; Diacelia. Twelve thousand Pistols in Gold I expected, [to Per. But, Friend, if you ingage that, bona fide, The Jewels are worth so much, I'l acept'em. Per. Two thousand Pistols my Lord Lugo will Bring from the Mint, these are well worth ten thousand. Me. These you deliver upon Reputation? Per. First, Madam, give me leave to satisfie My curiosity; do you, Greek Ladies, Keep Turkish State? Me. It is both State and Wisdom, Servants and Children to their Mistresses And Mothers should be Mutes, bow, not presume To ask. Per. But may a Stranger use his tongue? Will you not be offended if I speak? Me. What would you say? Per. Protest, I know not what: For though we that are bred up in the Wars, Are seldom out of countenance in Peace, Your presence daunts me. Me. We are Great, not Proud. Per. I am not ignorant, what a high Esteem The Court has for you, what respect the Lords; May then a poor plain Captain ask a question? Me. It shall be answer'd, if't be in our Sphere. Per. 'Tis in the Sphere of your Activity; Live you not by your Wits? Me. Alas, poor Captain; Are you come to your Wits? Fear's a short Phrensie, Speak again. Per. Live you by your Wits? Me. Again. Per. Are you a Cheat? Me. In Hell's name, what art thou, That ask'st me this damn'd question? Per. A Sea-Captain. Me. Or (as some Copies render it) a Pirate. Per. I was a Pirate, Sovereign of the Sea, Fir'd Billows, to make way for Robbery, Kept a Prize-Office at Algier, of Goods Stoln from my Prince, the mighty King of Spain, (For which I have his Pardon in my poquet) And do you think a Pirate, an old Thief, Can want eyes to discern his fellow-Thief? Me. It were a vanity for me to halt Before a Cripple; I imploy the Talent, Nature gave me to live by: This young Lord I mean to cheat; Leandra shall be fold Over and over. But (bold Captain) you That were the Sovereign of the Sea (and so forth) Kept a Prize-Office at Algier, of Goods Stoln from your Prince, the mighty King of Spain, You will not scruple (sure) to joyn in cheating Any of the King's Subjects, though your Friend? Per. Joyn? we'l joyn Issue, for I'l marry thee. Me. Two words to such a bargain, worthy Captain. Discharge your Trust, deliver me the Jewels, And on my Honour, I'l not be unthankful. Per. Three words to such a bargain, noble Lady. These Gems are held in Mort-main, lockt as fast As in a dead man's hands, I will take nothing, I'l give my self and these; accept of both, Or neither. Me. What if neither? Per. Why then, Madam, Graciously you may please to hang your self, And save the Law a labour. Does Menanthe Because grown gallanter, (Leandra taller) Think I forget thee and thy theft in Candy? Refuse me, and to all Thieves (that dare live Under the Noses of the men they robb'd) I'l make thee an Example; marry me, This Hand, this Sword, protects thee. Me. Nay, if you Have had a Passion for me so long since, And never yet, from your undaunted heart, Could blot out my Remembrance; 'tis a Match. Per. Lugo shall pay thy Portion. Me. One half, Captain; The Prince shall pay the other Moyety. [Exeunt. Enter Salerno, and Filomarini with a Book of Pictures in little. Sal. From th'Universal Monarch? Fil. That's his Style. Sal. Tell me (ere I inquire into thy Message) How long is't since his Holiness confer'd That Title on the King? Fil. What King? Sal. Our King, The King of Spain; com'st thou not from the King? Fil. I come from one to whom the King's a Subject. Sal. Thou speak'st not like a subject; what's thy name? Fil. My name is Draco. Sal. Of the Athenian Draco's? Fil. No, of the English Drakes, great Captain Drake (That sail'd the World round) left in Spain a By-blow, Of whom I come. Sal. From whence com'st thou to me? What Prince's Agent art thou? Fil. Love's, Love's Envoy; I am a Messenger from Cupid, sent To help you to a Venus. Sal. But one Venus? Fil. To one, two, three, four hundred Venuses: Build a Seraglio, I can furnish it With Rarities; Provided, you will have The Patience of a Prince, to see, and hear. Sal. Reverend Pimp, thou shalt have Audience. Fil. Illustrious Potentate, Love's Envoy shews Letters of Credence; There's a Mistris for you. [Fil. shews a Picture, Sal. looks on't and throws it away. Sal. There she's for thee again, the Pox to boot, To wish it her, the curse would come too late; Why, one Eye's perish'd. Fil. Sir, I Articled For patience; what great Lapidary ever Shew'd his best Diamond first? Here's one will fit you. Sal. Fourscore years hence, for she's at least a hundred. Fil. You're very curious; This is young enough. Sal. Ugly enough too in all conscience; Pretty' Owl, how't stares? and deep in the Green-sickness: Go, go; she that I take the pains to cure, Shall be a Paragon. Fil. A Paragon This is, or my eyes fail me; by degrees Examine her, the Morning is not youngerâ Sal. Nor blushes sweeter; what a Skin? the Alps Were never whiter: Lips which eager Birds Would peck at, for Ripe Cherries; CÃ¦sar's Eyes, That Conquer Nations they but look upon. Fil. Have I perform'd like a Discoverer? Sal. Had the great Drake (whose Issue thou art) put As many Girdles round about the Earth, As ever the Sun did about the Heavens, A Lovelier he could not have discover'd. But, Sirrha, will you justifie this Piece? Shall not I (as a mighty Prince did) curse The Picture-drawer, when I see the Maid? Fil. Sir, if her Character were to be writ: The sweetness of her Disposition, Her Mildness, Innocence, Humility, Obedience, if these were to be describ'd, Your Highness might curse th'Orator and Poet; But you will bless me and the Picture-drawer, When you shall see Leandra. Sal. Ha, Leandra? I have heard of her Mother, the Greek Lady, My service, honest Draco, soon at night I'l visit her. Fil. No, then you'l come too late; Your Cousin Lugo will be marri'd to her: His Duel was a trick, Sir, to change Brides. Sal. That must not be; then I'l go with thee, Draco. Fil. No, then you'l come too early; let me try My little wit first to break off the Treaty. If you'l be at your Palace, when 'tis time I'l call you. [A Banquet set forth. Sal. What if Lugo should debauch her? Fil. I'l watch for you, like Danae's old Father. Sal. I'l pay thee better than young Jupiter Paid his Procurer, when the wanton God Coin'd himself into Gold. Let none corrupt Enter Iberio. Her Virtues but my self. Iberio, see, [Exit Fil. Wonder, and shake hands, I am going to her. Iber. You shall stay, and rid me of Decio first. Enter Pyramena. Py. I cannot get my Husband to the Banquet, He's so pleas'd with your Cousin Arviedo, (His Brother-Lutenist) he has carri'd him To see his new Scenes, for this hour they're safe. Sir, will you please to sit? Sal. To wait of you. Iber. Oh, pray be gone; he's full of business, Madam; You lose your time. Sal. Then I've my liberty. Iber. I'l throw Marc Antony's old Shoo after you: His Slippers will serve me, I'm going to bed. Now, Madam, we are (to our wish) alone. Exit. Sal. they sit to the Banq. Py. The fewer the better fare; you freelier may Taste any thing you love here. Iber. I love you. Py. You cannot better, than I love your Lordship. Iber. That's Musique to our Banquet. Let's embrace The Opportunity, and one another. Py. I hope I understand not, what do y' mean? Iber. To claim your promise. Py. What was't? Iber. Any thing In your pow'r. Py. Such a promise I did make. Iber. Perform it; your Injoyment's in your power. Py. I have heard Casuists say, That's only in Our pow'r which justly and safely we may do. Iber. Then do what's in your pow'r, perform your Promise, That's just; and be my Love, and you are safe. Py. In Honor Iber. Honor? Py. I love you, my Lord, Above all men, (my Husband not excepted) But I love Virtue more than I love you. Iber. If you love Virtue so much, when you knew My application vitious, why did you Incourage me to hope? tell me the truth? Py. The truth is, I have fool'd you. Iber. Cruelly. Py. I have indeed, cruelly fool'd your Lordship. He rises and shuts the door. Do y'lock the door? you will not ravish me? Iber. Oh no; my fair inviting Cruelty, You will be found the Ravisher: no Law Adjudges him a Murderer, that kills One that provok'd him. Th'Anch'rite, who has liv'd An Age in's Grave, remembers not his Mistris With greater horror, than I thought of you, Until you courted me, and blew the sparks Of my old Love into a flame of Lust, Which shall (as your due Punishment) consume you, In your own Instrument of Tyranny, Like the Designer of the Brazen Bull. Py. Your Brazen Bull's an Ass; th'Inventer of it A Novice in my Art of Tyranny, He tortur'd but the Body, I the Soul, Which I know nothing more torments, than Hope Rais'd high, and levell'd. Iber. Do you smile? Py. I laugh, To see so great a Soldier fool himself With a belief, that th'Enemy (the Traitor, As you were graciously pleas'd to call me) Would yield without a Summons: true it is, To work your Hope up to a Confidence, My white Flag I hung out, courted a Treaty, As if I held a Fort untenable, You'l find it Man'd, the Woman so well Man'd, That you may sooner take Constantinople. Iber. Yet valiant Madam, notwithstanding all Your scornful Ranting in our Terms of War, You are impolitique in your cruelty, That to torment me sacrifize your Honour. She catches a Knife from the Table. Py. See what protects my Honour; if you stir, I'l shew you what poor Lucrece should have done, My Honour shall not dye before my self. Iber. But if you kill your self, the Prince (who knows You sought this meeting) what will he report? Py. Report can neither do me good nor hurt, [She lays her hand on her heart. Here's that will justifie me after death. And know, that since Iberio declar'd For Jealousie against Love, I scorn'd life: Nor had my Soul indur'd her Clog so long, But to convince you of Apostacy: This made me marry a Fool, and then invite You to this Parley, that your Eyes might give Your Heart the Lie, when you beheld me stand The Flatteries and Threats of him I love, Yet not dishonor him that I love not; And now, farewel to both. Iber. Hold, more than Woman, Heroick Lady, shew one Bravery more; Forgive me, next ill thoughts I have of you, I'l pluck my heart out, 'tis no heart for me, That thinks you less than Saint. Py. Now we are friends. [She flings down the Knife. Iber. And friend, I'l tell y' a secret, kept from you, When I was but your Servant; I command These men rais'd by his Holiness to serve The State of Venice against the Grand Signor; They are imbark't, this night I go abroad, Therefore my Love, (still you're my Virtuous Love) Though it grieves me to speakâ Py. And me to hearâ Iber. Yet the sad word must be pronounc'd, Farewel. Py. You shall not Farewel yet, I'l call for Cards And hold you one hour longer. Iber. What you please; I am your Soldier, you command in Chief. Py. Then play a little, to beguile our grief. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Decio and Arviedo. By a Lawrel-Tree is set a Shepherds Hook, a Pipe, and a Wreath of Lawrel. Dec. The breath of Musick (Brother Lutenist) Is Sound, which into points of Time Art breaks: But Poetry's the Language Musick speaks. Poetry's that Divinity of Numbers, By which Pythagoras transform'd himself Into the sev'ral shapes of Men and Gods; And thou, or I may do't, as well as He. Arv. I think we may. Dec. Behold th'Experiment, I'm Decio now; but now that I take up This Shepherds Hook, Pipe, and Poetick Lawrel. I am Apollo Shepherd to Admetus, Not Herdsman: I have left his Royal Droves In Thessaly, to keep his Flocks in Naples. Will Arviedo be my Favourite, My Hyacinthus? Arv. What must transform me? Dec. Poetry; a new Ode, which I've compos'd; Sit down and hear it, 'tis Apollo's Song. Here I Pipe, here I keep King Admetus's Sheep, Here I gather Lawrel for my Wreath: But Apollo, where Do'st thou live? Oh not here; Absent Lovers live not where they breath. But my Spirit is In a Place of Bliss, Whereso'er that Blessed Place may lie, In a Garden, or a Grove, In a Grott, or an Alcove: Ever where my Love is, there am I. Uncircumscrib'd thus acts the Mind, Why should the Body be confin'd? Swift as thought can move, Little God of Love, Carry me, upon thy nimble Wings, To the top of yonder Tow'r, Where percisely at this hour Hyacinthus strikes his Lute and sings, We are met, sweet Boy, What I now enjoy Not a God, besides my self, shall know: Cupid, thou hast leave to play, To thy Mother fly, and say, That Apollo has a Heav'n below. Arv. You have feasted mine Ear. Dec. I'l treat thy Eye; The sweetest Prospect Naples has, I'l shew thee, The Pasture where Apollo feeds his Flocks. The Scene is discovered, over which in Capital Letters is writ CAMPI ELYSII. Decio describes it thus. Th'Elysian Fields my Hyacinthus sees, Those Walks are Jessamine and Orange-trees, Beneath, a Chrystal River cuts the Plain, Wherein you see those fair Trees o're again, Close by the Flow'ry Bank, a Flock of Sheep Feeds in a Mead; the Shepherds fast a-sleep; The Shepherdesses lying arm in arm. Arv. Is't Life? or Art? Dec. Art Magick, hear the Charm. Rise, dull Sleepers, fie, how coldly You move! Shepherds, come on boldly; No Wolf shall your Flocks indanger; Dance, and welcom this young Stranger. [The Shepherds dance, and go off. Arv. I take this as a high Civility, For which I'l thank you with a Friend's Advice; Go to your Wife; lose her not the first day: If she think you neglect her, she will hate you. Dec. She cannot think it a Neglect in me To leave her with Iberio and the Prince: Can she have better company than they? Arv. She may have safer; the Prince flies at all: You know, my Lord Iberio was your Rival. Dec. True; he and Pyramena were contracted Upon conditions (mutually agreed to) And pr'y thee, Arviedo, tell me truly, Which of our Titles dost thou think the best? Arv. I am no competent Judge; but (questionless) You would resolv't, before you marri'd her; It must not now be question'd. Dec. Not in publick; But in a Court of Conscience, thou may'st be Judge or Assistant? Arv. How do y' mean Assistant? Dec. I mean, if you conceive the Match unlawful, You then may lawfully assist your Kinsman, To Cuckold me. Arv. Keep distance; we shall meet As Friends no more; I am thy Enemy, As much as thou art Enemy to Virtue; Draw, I will fairly vindicate my Honour. Dec. I will not fight. Arv. Draw, or I vow to kill thee. Ingrateful Villain, Is an Infamy All the return thou mak'st for a Friend's counsel, Against my Kinsman's Opportunity? I gave it, that thou might'st not be a Wittall, He an Adulterer, I a Property. I'l talk no longerâ Dec. Hear me; but a word. Arv. Quick; for my Wrong calls for a swift Revenge. Dec. It needs not any; know, all I said now, And all I did before, when I brought Gold To work upon thy Poverty, and make thee For thy advantage poison thy great Kinsman, Was but to try the gallantry of thy Mind, Which I find equal to thy outward Beauty. Arv. No fooling now. Dec. If you believe me not, Behold, I put my life into your hands. Decio delivers up his sword. Arv. I must believe th'Innocence of that face; A thousand times better than mineâ Dec. Dost like it? Arv. Better than any face I ever saw. Dec. It seems, thou, and my Lord Iberio Are not alli'd in Judgment; for, my Sister (Whose heart he broke) was like me. Arv. To preserve So sweet a Maid, I rather would have dy'd. Dec. Pray, wear this Ring for Ericina's sake, 'Twas hers. Arv. The Diamond is a rich Stone, But Ericina's name doubles the value. Dec. Something from me you must accept; I know, You're neither Lord of Gold nor Silver-Mines. Arv. My Ancestor did service here in Naples, VVhich both the Indies could not pay him for: It pleas'd the King to call him into Spain, And so his Branches (at this distance) wither'd. Dec. Here, take this Purse. Arv. I take no Purses, Sir, I am no Thief, I have more of the Merchant, The Money I receive I will return. Dec. I'l shew thee how to pay this Debt, and leave Me in Arrear: get Dancers, and this Ev'ning Make me a Serenade, 'tis only a Round Well-danc'd, and a short Song or two; let's see Thy Poetry? Arv. I never studi'd it, Yet naturally I'm a Ballet-maker, I'l keep your Purse, and lay out the Gold for you. Dec. Then I've the noblest Steward in the world. [Exit Arviedo. Enter Corbulo. Cor. Good e'n; what day's this? Dec. St. Gennaro's day, Patron of Naples. Cor. And your Wedding-day, I take it: here's the Bridegroom, at his Pastime, But where's the Bride? what Sport is she at? Cards; Who plays with her? Dec. The Prince. Cor. The Prince is gone; My Lord Iberio plays with your Wife. Dec. I like that wellâ Cor. And they're lock'd up; you like That well too? Dec. Do you grumble at it, Slave? Cannot my Wife be private with her Servant, But that my Servant must take notice of it? Cor. Why do I wait? Dec. What did I hire thee for? To be my Porter, and to guard my Wife. Cor. That she may take her pleasure undisturb'd? Dec. That she may take her pleasure undisturb'd. Cor. But must she take it with another man? Cannot you, Sir, content a Wife? Dec. Nor you, Sir, Nor any man in Europe, with one Body: He sooner might content her with one Gown. Cor. Then you'l allow your Lady a Gallant? Dec. I hold it Husband's Duty to provide An Adjutant. Cor. Th'Opinion's new, and strange. Dec. 'Tis strange, that you (a Soldier) say 'tis new: Why? Generals have Adjutants General. Cor. This I pass over; look I never hear, In things of baseness that you use again The noble name of Soldier, if I do, I'l lay down your Commission here, my Staff, And cut your throat. Dec. Thou know'st, Lieutenant, I Love Soldiers, and have shew'd my love to thee, Reliev'd thy wants, because thou wert a Soldier, A Sufferer; trusted thee with the guard Of my fair Wife, because thou hast the name Of a stout Soldier; but though I love thee I do not love thy humor, mine is fooling, And by a Jeaster's Privilege I speak Severe things against Women, as if we Had no Italian Wives but Messalinas, But I know many Portias, gallant Ladies, Whose life, and death depends upon their Husbands. And wouldst thou have me jealous of my Wife? Cor. Sir, I would have you jealous of your Honour. Dec. What Honour can be greater, than to see The Ladies point at me, and call me, Mirrour Of Marri'd men, Mirrour of Marri'd men? Cor. They'l point at you, and call you, what do you think? Dec. Not Cuckold? Cor. No, not Cuckoldâ Dec. That were shameful. Cor. But this dishonourable, They'l call you The basest kind of Cuckold, Wittall, Sir. Dec. How? Wittall? that's an ugly name indeed, (Now thou hast spoke to my capacity) I'l not indure itâbut my Lord Iberio May challenge me. Cor. Against the world, I'l be Your Second. Dec. I shall do brave things, I think: Lead, Soldier; Devil? Wittal? I defie thee. [Exeunt. Enter Filomarini and Gioseppe. Gio. Ha, ha, ha! Fil. This Laugh promises good news. Gio. If't be not profitable news, 'tis pleasant; Pray wish your old Camrade, Peralta, joy; He's marri'd to Menanthe. Fil. They're well match'd, Pirate and Cheat: the Gallies give 'em joy, Is this the pleasant news? Gio. No, the sport is, The two Cheats mean to cozen one another. Fil. Why, sure the Pirate will not cheat his Bride? Gio. Ev'n of his first nights service, he's in love With his Wife's Maid, his suppos'd Country-woman, Your Grand-child, she has told it to your Mistris. Fil. But when Thieves fall out, methinks true men might Come by their own. Gio. This is the pleasant news, Fritilla hopes to cozen the two Cheats. Enter Menanthe and Diacelia, Peralta following a-loof. Fil. See, see, the Pirateâ Gio. How he tacks about To weather her? he's got to Windward of her, But the small Pinnace to the Lean-ward, proves The better Sailer. Fil. Let us give'em Sea-room. [Exeunt Fil. &amp; Gios. Me. Dog, Dog, Piratick Sea-dogâ Dia. Patience, Madam, I may mistake, believe your eyes, That Pillar will obscure you. Me. Good, good Girl. Menanthe stands behind the Pillar and Peeps. Per. Fritilla? hist, Fritilla; is she gone? Dia. Her business requires haste, and so does mine. Per. One little word with me, before you go. Dear Country-woman, pitty a poor Spaniard, Or, like a Roman Funeral, I shall burn To ashes for thy love. Dia. For love to me? You have a Wife. Per. Foh! a rich stinking Jew, Taken into my Body-Politick; I marri'd an Expedient, not a Wife; Jewels and Gold I marri'd. Me. A Rope take thee, My Garter (Rogue) would serve; Queen Joan of Naples Hang'd up her Husband in her Wedding-garter. Per. I took a rich Jade for her wealthy Burden. Me. Cheated directly, all the Bootie's gone; Body and Goods I'l venture after it, But I'l revenge me on this Spanish Rogue, My Husband-Gusman. Per. Smile some consolation. Dia. Why, Don, think you here's such a death of Spaniards, That I must be a Spanish Pirate's Wench? Our Country-Fig, a Spanish Fig for Pirates. Me. Would mine had one in's guts, a Spanish Fig Would cure his Itch; but he shall smart, I'l scratch him; The merry Greek will claw her mangie Don. Per. My Wench? I scorn it, thou shalt be my Wife. Dia. The Church allows no man two Wives at once. Per. True; but this Marriage is a Nullity, 'Tis within the Degrees prohibited; My Mother was a Grecian, and her Father Was (I can prove it) Brother to Menanthe, Th'old-woman's my Great-Aunt. Me. O lying Raskal! Per. But say thou wilt be mine, and 'tis enough, I'l hire a passage for's in the Pope's Galley, That's bound for Ostia, and I'l marry thee (In the face of the Church, my Girl) at Rome. Dia. You see I'm silent. Per. Silence gives consent. Dia. No Captain. Per. Maids say no, and take it, Jewel; Now I name Jewel, I will give Fritilla All Lugo's Jewels. Dia. If you keep one back, It is no Match. Per. A match then. Dia. You must get My Grand-father's good-will. Here's your Great-Aunt. Enter Menanthe. Per. That we may be kept from commiting Incest; The Devil choak her; heark you, pretty one, Lugo must not know we are marri'd, Lamb. Me. I would he knew we were unmarri'd, Goat. Enter Gioseppe and Filomarini. Gio. Madam, here's my Lord Lugo. Me. Call Leandra. [Exit Gioseppe. Enter Lugo. Fil. The Prince is come. Me. Wait him in, honest Draco. [Exit Fil. Lug. Two thousand Pistols, Madam, I have brought you In new-coin'd Gold. Per. I'l give 'em to her Maid. [Peralta takes the bag. Me. Hey, Snap! she knows for what use they're design'd. Per. And I know for what use your Maid's design'd. Enter Leandra. Me. My Lord, you've made a purchase of a Wife. Lug. I've purchas'd Happiness in so much Beauty; But her sweetness of Obedience. And Harmony of Nature, all those Worlds Of Musick which Divine Pythagoras Plac'd in the Planets. Where's the Priest? Enter Salerno and Filomarini. Lean. Here's one That looks more like the Bride-groom than the Priest. Fil. 'Tis the Prince of Salerno. [to Leandra. Lug. What wind blows My cousin of Salerno? Dia. The Prince, Madam. [to Leandra. Sal. Directed to the life by this fair Figure. [He shews her Picture. Lug. Decline his courtship; slight him. Lean. Slight a Prince? Me. Withdraw, I pr'y thee. Lean. Pr'y thee? pr'y thee peace, (I never heard so simple an old Soul) When a Prince makes his first Address, withdraw? Me. I charge theeâ Lug. Do you hear who charges you? Your Mother, never disobey'd. Lean. There is A time for all things, for my Mother too To be advis'd better than to enjoyn Ill manners: leave a Prince that visits me? Lug. Not when your Mother (that groan'd for you) bids? Lean. I'l ask a question first; pray, Sir, how got you My Picture? Sal. Madam, by a Miracle. Me. Get y'in. Lean. I'l stay to hear the Miracle. Sal. Now for a Story to excuse Love's Envoy. [to Fil. 'Twas news at Court, that the great Virtuoso, Virgetio, was come from Rome to Naples, And had brought with him a rare Concave-glass, Made with Art more than Mathematical, So that upon a white Plane 'twould cast off The Form or Species of the Man or Woman Any one wish'd to see; to him I went (Out of an Airy curiosity) To see my Mistris. Lean. And he shew'd you this? Sal. The form by which my Servant drew this Piece. Lean. This? (what a Villain was the Virtuoso!) This Mistris? Mother, pardonâ Lug. Her first fault. Me. Take heed, my Girl, take heed of a Relapse, If you forget your duty any moreâ Lean. Then do not you remember such a child. Enter Gioseppe. Gio. The Priest is ready. Lug. We are ready for him. Sal. I must beg of youâ Lean. Of me? Lug. Hear him not. Lean. Not hear a Prince that comes a begging to me? I'l hear and answer: Sir, what's your command? Sal. Madam, my suit is, that you'l please to sit for Your Picture, and I'l send you a great Master. Shall limn it (rarely) by the life. Lean. He shall. Me. Daughter, he shall not. Lean. Woman, Shall thy Men, Those thou imploy'st: the Limner comes to me, And I'l not have him Shall'd. Me. VVoman? Lean. Good VVoman, Meddle with thy own Matters, good Old VVoman. Me. Th'Old VVoman's Mother to my fine Young Lady, If she be pleased to remember it. Sal. Remember, that you are a Prince's Mistris. Lean. A Prince's Mistris? though 'twas my Resemblance That Mistris could not be Leandra's Spirit; I do remember, that you are my Mother, And once again I pray to be forgiven: But send your Picture-drawer, Sir, I'l sit, If she were all the Mothers under th'Sun. Fil. Go, leave the Prince to pause on't. [to Leandra. Lug. Come, my Love. [Exeunt Lug. Lean. Menan. &amp; Gios. Sal. She would be my Love too, but not my Mistris; But, Mistris, I may Master you, I may. Fil. You shall; in my Experience, Sir, confide, Youth marches safe that follows an old Guide. [Exeunt. Enter Decio and Corbulo. Cor. Your Wife comes. Dec. I'm grown valiant now, Lieutenant, I'l march, but stand thouâ Enter Pyramena. Cor. Centree for my Captain. [Exit Corb. Py. My heart, I was at such a lossâ Dec. At Cards? Py. No, I won all I play'd for: but I was At such a loss for want of theeâ Dec. To fool? I know my duty, 'tis my Family-duty; Tell me true, had'st thou ever marri'd me, But for the noble quality of fooling, Taking me for a Gifted man? Py. That gift (I must confess) brib'd me. Dec. Th'Acknowledgement Is most ingenious; at another time, I'l be as free with thee, and tell thee why I marri'd thee. Py. Will you not tell me now? Dec. Now you shall tell me, who play'd at Cards with you? Py. None but my Lord Iberio and I plai'd. Dec. Who waited? Py. No Body. Dec. No Page? Py. No Page. Dec. No Groom? Py. No Groom; I tell you no body. Dec. What, not your Woman? Py. Not my Woman: lack, How your tongue runs? Dec. If any man, but I, Be private with my VVife, is't for her Honour? Py. Is Honour treated of, by your small Poets? Do y'find it among Gods and Goddesses? Pray tell me, what's our Honour? or Dishonour? Dec. VVhat's th'Honour or Dishonour of a VVife? 'Tis at her death (when clear unbyass'd Truth Takes th'Inventory of her Vice and Virtue) The Total Sum, th'Account that Fame gives of her. Py. How? this is sence; these are not Parot's words: This Husband is no Engin, but a Man, A jealous Man; I shall love Jealousie, If it awake his Soul. I'l try him further: [aside. But how gets Fame her good and bad Reports? Dec. Of th'eating and the drinking mouths, our Servants: VVe must be careful of our Credit (Love) Unless we mean to be our Servants Slaves. Py. Kiss me; you shall find fault with me no more, Henceforth I will be jealous of my self. Dec. Howe're you take it, it concerns you most; If you miscarry in your Honour, I Shall (like a Merchant broke by his misfortune) Be pitty'd; but my VVife will be despis'd. Py. VVhat will this Man prove? what shall I say to him? Iberio never was alone with me, But by my Maids I made your Men believe't, To put the sense of Honor into you. Now you deserve my Love, kiss me again. Dec. Here's a new VVedding on th'old VVedding-day; VVere the Mask readyâ Enter Corbulo. Cor. Sir, a kind of Mask Is brought you (these hard words stick in my throat) Enter Arviedo. They call't a Serenade, here's the Presenter. Dec. My Arviedo, welcome; 'tis apparent, Thou wilt not fail thy friend in great Ingagements, Who art so punctual in a promis'd trifle. Arv. The man that is not in th'Enemies pow'r, Nor fetter'd by Misfortune, and breaks promise, Degrades himself, he never can pretend To Honour more. Dec. Thou art the Soul of Honor. Enter the Evening (in a Crown of Shadow'd Stars, and a Clowdy Vest with some small Stars upon it) brought in with to Winds. What's here? if th'Evening (as I fancy it) Could take a Visible form, this would be ours, A gloomy Evening, suddenly brought in By two Winds. Arv. You ghess right, 'tis so intended. Madam, I only beg you'l pardon me, If you will, he must, for 'twas his Injunction. [they sit. Flajolet plays a far off. Song in Dialogue. Evening. I am an Evening dark as Night, Jack-with-the-Lantern bring a Lightâ Jack. Wither, whither, whither? [within. Evening. Hither, hither, hither. Jack. Thou art some pratling Eccho, of my making: Evening. Thou art a Foolish Fire, by thy mistaking: I am the Evening that creates thee. Enter Jack in a black Suit border'd with Glow-worms, a Coronet of Shaded Beams on his head, over it a Paper Lantern with a Candle in't. Jack. My Lantern and my Candle waits thee. Evening. Those Flajolets that we heard play, Are Reapers who have lost their way; They Play, they Sing, they Dance a-Round, Lead them up, here's Faery-ground. Chorus. Let the Men ware the Ditches; Maids, look to your Breetches, We'l scratch them with Briars and Thistles: When the Flajolets cry, We are a-dry; Pond-water shall wet their Whistles. [Exeunt Evening, Winds, &amp; Jack. Dec. Does Pyramena know this Dancing Lantern? Py. The Ignis Fatuus I suppose; some call it Jack-with-the-Lantern, some, Will With the Wisp; 'Tis th'Evening's False Light, which leads stumbling Clowns (O're Moors and Marches) into Bogs and Pits. The Violins and Flajolets play. Jack leads in the Reapers, the Men in their Half-Shirts and Linnen Drawers, the Maids in Straw-Hats they stumble, and their Sickles fall into the Scene. They Dance in Figures. At the end of the first Dance Jack leads them out, and once or twice they thread the doors after him, then they take hands, compass in Jack, Dance a Round, and Sing. Buff's a fine Sport, And so's Course o'-Park; But both come short Of a Dance in the Dark. We trip it completely, The Pipe sounds so neatly: But that which surpasses Is the breath of the Lasses, O the pretty Rogues kiss featly. [Jack runs away and leaves them to stumble out in the dark. Arv. Now if the Bride and Bride-groom's patience Be not tormented with my Poetryâ Dec. Profess 'tis well, 'tis natural, it suits This Clowdy Evening: in a little time Thou'lt make as pretty a Poet as my self. I'l pay my thanks in Coin of the same Stamp, You shall see th'Practice of my Mask; I hope, Love, you'l be pleas'd? Py. With any thing of yours. Dec. That's the sweet Close to Arviedo's Musique; Th'expression of your love unclowds the Evening; What greater blessing can from Heav'n descend? Decio is happy in a Wife and Friend. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Decio and Corbulo. Cor. Italians are the Prodigies of Malice; No People under Heav'n, nor Fiends in Hell, Out-do us in the plotting out Revenges; But a Design like yours I never heard of, Nor could believe it possible in Nature. Yet, for Humanitie's sake, stop your progress. Dec. Disswade me not, I'm deaf to intercession. Cor. I know, 'twill grieve your soft Soul, when 'tis done; Then how much better were it, not to do it? Dec. If the Train I have laid would spring a Mine To blow up Naples, I'd give fire and perish. Cor. Spare me. Dec. How? Cor. I desire to be excus'd, Corbulo will not act in't. Dec. But he shall; Thou hast my Secret, and I have thy Oath: Dispute not, execute. Cor. Well, then I must. But you'l curse th'Instrument. Dec. The hand Divine. Moves such an Instrument; the hand of Justice Squares Punishment adequate to th'Offence; Despair for Scorn is but due Recompence. My Lord Iberio's with his Regiment. And Arviedo gone aboard, to take Leave of his Kinsman, when the youth returns To my house, be you sure you let him in. My Wife may send Arviedo for Iberio.

No, not for Money. Ghess again. Py. For Love? Dec. Not for love neither; thou art a base Ghesser; But I'l resolve thee. I did marry thee (As th'ill-fac'd woman's Husband was made Cuckold) For spight. Py. Ha, haâ Dec. I'm glad it makes you merry. Why, thou more fool than thou imagin'dst me, What Worm trepan'd thee, boar'd quite through thy skull Into thy dull brains, to think Decio Would feed upon Reversion of a Mistris: A Mistris to my mortal Enemy, My Sister's Murderer, Iberio? Py. I doubtâ Dec. Do'st but doubt? Bondmaid, know thy Lord. At our last Conference, I cast off my Clowd, My Property, the Droll; now I appear My self, a stern Venetian, principled Out of old MachiavelâWhen I marri'd thee, I marri'd (my dear Sister) thy Revenge. Py. How miserable have I made my self! Dec. To make me happy; I have scap'd the Wheel By marrying thee, I'd been broke every bone, Had I done that I came to Naples for, Poison'd Iberio any way but thisâ I triumph in the ruins of his Love, His Soveraign is my Slave, my hated Slave. Py. But how have I transgress'd? in punishing Me for him, are you just? Dec. No, I am cruel: All high Revenges must dispense with Justice. If I had to my End no other way, But like a Witch to violate the Grave Of my (now blessed) Sister Exicina, Who for her love to false Iberio dy'd, I would break up her hallow'd Marble; tear Her Sear-cloth; scatter her sweet Bones; and cast Her dust in's face to blast him. Py. O my heart! Dec. I would not have it broke, till it be bruis'd; Until, by slow (but Sensible) degrees, I break the Idol which my Enemy worships. I know, your Hearts are like two Lutes rack'd up To the same pitch, and when I touch but one The other (by mysterious Sympathy) Will (though at distance) answer Note by Note, With the same dying sound; and that's the Musique My heart so longs to hear.

Enter Arviodo. Dec. Arviedo's come; I hope, she'l send him for Iberio. [Exeunt Dec. &amp; Cor. Arv. Madam, look up, you shall not be thus us'd By a base man (how was I couzen'd with him!) I've heard all, I'l call him to an account. Py. Is my Lord Iberio gone aboard. Arv. An hour since, but the Fleet rides still at Anchor; I'l take a Boat, and tell him how 'tis with you; I know he'l come. Py. And let me speak with him, Before you call Decio to an account: But let him bring no Soldiers, lest the Porter Shut up the Gates; Dear Arviedo, go. Arv. Would I could flie. Py. Hast thou not wings conceal'd? Thou look'st like my Good-Angel. Arv. I had need To borrow both his Vigilance and Speed. [Exeunt. Enter Filomarini and Peralta. Fil. The greatest honour Draco's Family Yet ever had, is, that Captain Peralta (The Glory and the Terror of our Nation) Has a mind to my Grand-child. Per. Oh! she's pretty. Fil. Prettiness it self I wish her, for your sake. Per.

You'l find me honest: I hope you'l find my Granchild honest too, I mean not of her Body, (as for that, You, that must be her Husband, may dispose it) But honest of her Mind your new Bride must be By Nature, by my Copie; I dare swear That to redeem me (if I were in pawn) She would not rob y' of any of the Jewels (Which you have promis'd to intrust her with) Yet if she would she cannot.

But to my business, Grand-father, The Prince Offers not at this breathing Shrine, Leandra, And there's no waiting for uncertain hopes; Besides I fear my Lord Filomarini May come unlook'd for; I'l pack up my free-boot: Remember an hour hence, in the close Walk.

I (Cosen) that came to your house this morning, To give your other Bride, that was my Mistress, I will not stick at giving of Leandra. Lean. Pray hold your hand, my Mother will give me. Dia. What means Leandra? [Men. and Lean. whisper. Fil. As you do, to follow Her Guardian's advice; and yet she needs not My Precepts, Nature has instructed her: Madam, be confident, she'l demean her self As it becomes a Daughter to your Father. Me. Take her, Son; finely put off the Fool Lugo. Lean. You must not then be angry, if I rant As well at you as him. Me. I will not, Child. Lean. Then I'l spare neither. Diacelia now [to Dia. Shall see me do a younger Sister's duty, Cashier your Bride-groom. Mother-Midnight, take Your Son-in-law and marry him your self; You may as well obey me, as I you: I disclaim you for Mother, him for Husband. Lug. Have I with all those thousands purchas'd this? What reason have you for disowning me? Lean. What reason had you to disown a Princess? Lug. Would not you be a Princess? Lean. If I were, This Antient Gentlewoman (that presumes To call her self my Mother) should be rack'd So long, till she confess'd her self to be My Step-mother; for could a Natural Mother Betray her Child to one that has no Honour But Title? Lug. Blind Love, thou art off my heart: And now with open eyes I see my folly. Were your Ambition pleas'd, were you a Princess, Were you an Angel, since the Devil's in you, I would not marry you; I'l find a Wife That's not a wicked Daughter. Lean. Do, go home, 'Tis time you ask forgiveness of your Bride. Lug. You, of your Mother; but I'l pardon neither, Both shall hear from me, th'old Cheat, and young Ranter. [Exit Lugo. Dia. So, so; my Game plays well. Me. Now he's shak'd off, My Child puts on her old Obedience: And on your Highness freely I bestow (To be commanded what you please) my Daughter. Lean. Thy Daughter? do'st thou in good earnest think Thy self my Mother? Me. What think'st thou? Lean. I know, By my own Truth, my Mother was no Lyer; I know, by my Integrity, my Mother Could be no Cheat, and by my Modesty I know my Mother was no Bawd, which you Would be to the Prince; or else (virtuous Madam) I should not be commanded what he pleases. Me. Wretch, thou wilt break thy aged Mothers heart. Lean. Through her Ear; heark you, Beldam. [Whisper. Me. Sure the Devil Is her Intelligencer; 'tis high time. To shift for one, the Rogue will give's the slip. Let's go, Fritilla; Murd'rer of thy Mother, Hear my last words, I leave thee to the Prince. [Exeunt Men. &amp; Dia. Sal. You hear your Mother? she leaves you to me, By her Will Paroll, and that is as good To all intents of Law, as 'twere in Writing; Besides, you're left to the wide world, no fortune, But that foretold me by the Virtuosoâ Lean. That I should be your Mistris? that's your Servant, [She takes up one of the Wax-candles. Servant of Pleasure, put me into waiting, Pray let me light you to your Bed-chamber? [Exit Filomarini. Sal. By no means; I (your Servant) will light you. Lean. The Taper better suits my Fortune, Sir; And 'tis discretion, ere I do the Fault, To practise how the Penance will become me. Sal. You cannot think, you have so base a Servant As would see his Mistris do a publique Penance; Should my Lord-Cardinal here, and the whole College Of Cardinals at Rome, joyn to disgrace thee, I'd have a Rendezvouz of all my Friends, And meet them in the head of a brave Army, To beat them into more Civility. Set down the Taper. Lean. Not till I have foundâ Sal. You have lost nothing (to my knowledge) yet: What do you look for? Lean. A room dark enough To cover a Maid's blushes. Sal. As I live, The prettiest humor'd Mistris i'th' whole world. Why, do you look for darkness with a Light? I'l blow it outâ Lean. You may extinguish this; But who can blow out those, the Lights of Heav'n? The Stars still see us. Sal. When we see not them? If you mean the great Room, the Skie; 'tis dark, Not one Star there. Lean. Nor any Witness here? Sal. Let's search the Chamberâ Lean. Search the Closet first, Your Bosome; whosoe're contracts a guilt, Carries a clowd of Witnesses in his bosome. Sal. Her other Fits were Natural, she's now In her Divine Fit. [aside. Lean. Has he got no feeling? [aside. No sense of Honour, in a Man of Honour? You grow so dull, I see, you'd be at rest, And you'l not let me usher you: good-night. Sal. Wu't cross thy Fortune? Lean. No, your Virtuoso Is not so good, as I, at Fortune-telling; I'm rare at Physiognomie, I see My Fortune, wanton Prince, in your proud looks; You think me too unworthy for a Wife, And I know, I'm too worthy for a Mistris. Again, Good-night. Sal. Ask any thing but Marriageâ Lean. Any thing else I scorn, as you scorn me. Good-night for ever. Sal. There's a Passing-bellâ No Composition? Lean. Not your Prince's Crown; I'd rather carry a Milk-pail on my head. [Exit Lean. Sal. Well, go thy way, no Mean man got that Spirit; If't be her own air, not an humour put Into her by th'old Knave, in hope I'l marry her, And then her grateful hand must feed th'old Begger With my Gold; I've a Way to find the Plot, And if't be his, I'l cut off the Projector. Enter Filomarini. Draco? [Sal. draws his Sword. Fil. Congratulates your Victory; Nay your Sword, Sir, never made such a Conquest. Is she not unimaginable Sweetness You have enjoy'd? Sal. I made her a fair offer. Fil. She took it? Sal. Sooner she'd have taken Ratsbane. Fil. You mean not to kill her, for being honest? Sal. But I mean to kill thee, for being a Knave, Old lying Tempter; did'st not thou suggest The sweetness of her Disposition, Her Mildness, Innocence, Obedience? Fil. Sir, you're a Prince of Famous Memory, Those were my words, and I remember yours, Let none corrupt her Virtues but my self: You wish'd her Virtuous, that you only might Have the debauching of her, I have done What you commanded; if she disobey you, Because she's virtuous must I lose my life? Sal. Sall not I sheath my Sword in that Man's breast, Who has into my bosome flung Fire, Wild-fire, Not to be quench'd but either in thy blood, Or her fruition; there's no third way? yes, I'l marry her. Fil. (So cunning) Kill me first; I would not live, to see your Highness marry The Daughter of a Cheat. Sal. Live, Draco, live High in our favour, I suspected thee To have a plot upon me, had I found Thy hand in't, the whole Earth should not have sav'd thee: I will not lose thee now for the King's Indies. Fil. And shall you lose th'injoyment of Leandra? Shall such a Prince languish for such a Toy, That's now at my disposal? to be plain, The Cheat her Mother, and Sea-Thief her Husband, Having rookt your poore Love-sick Cousin, Lugo, Are fled away, Leandra left to me, But I've a Spie upon them, they will lodge With the fat Naples-Hostess, at old Joan's: Sign me your Warrant, I'l bring to your Palace The Cheats to morrow morning, but this night Leandra to your bed. Sal. Come I'l dispatch thee, And when 'tis done, I'l give thee a thousand Crowns. Fil. And if I do't not, cut my throat in earnest. [Exeunt. Enter Menanthe, Joan, and Gioseppe, with a Dark-Lantern. Me. Joan, hast thou courage to abuse Peralta? Joan. Imbolden'd with your Sack (for I have drunk [to Gios. A pottle of your bounty) I'd so fool The Knave your Husband into honesty, That he shall stumble over his young Mistris, And fall upon's old Wife. Gio. Thou wilt be famous For this night's work. Joan. This night, I will recover The credit of good women of my bulk: Rogues sha'nt say, all fat Hostesses are Bauds. Gio. Me-thinks, this merry Monster should cheer you; Why do you cry? for your ungratious Child? Me. No truly (I've made my best of her) I cry To think that I should marry such a Villain. Gio. You your self being such an innocent creature? Me. Send us good luck, for the night's foul and dark. Gio. The fitter for our knavery. They stay long; Enter Filomarini. Here comes the Captain? no, 'tis Captain Drake. Fil. Captain Peralta's at my heels; stand close. Gio. Husht, and the old Grey-Cat shall catch her Mouse That nibbles at a young delicious Maid. You'l have a sweet night, for he's high and hot. Me. I'l cool him with a Robbery, though I die for't. Enter Peralta with a Dark-Lantern in one hand, leading Diacelia in the other, she wears the Coronet and knot of Diamonds. Dia. Well, Captain, you are a complying Captain, To trust me with those Jewels, nothing else Could have made me trust my self in your hands: But now I'l follow you by Sea and Land, In Peace and War, I'l fight too. Per. O brave Girl! Dia. You've made me brave, the Master will mistake My Coronet for Ariadne's Crown, And in his knot of Diamonds find a Pole To sail by, this dark night. Per. Here is th'Osteria, We are landed at old Joan's: Shipwrack'd i'th' Harbour? Filomarini and Gioseppe break their hands and catch up Peralta's Lantern. Gioseppe and Joan put Menanthe's hand into Peralta's: Diacelia laying her cheek to Menanthe's, speaks to Peralta as if he held her by the hand. My Lantern gone? Fritilla? Dia. Here, Sir, here. Per. 'Twas happy we were come to this blind Alley, The Streets are laid for me, I durst not call At any other house. Joan, Joan, why Joan,? Joan. Sure I do hear Captain Peralta's voice: Heigh-ho. Per. Why dost thou sigh, and speak so faintly? A Light, Joan? Joan. O good Captain, I beseech you Name not a Light. That ever I was born To see the Light of Heaven? Per. Would I could see't, For 'tis as dark as Hell. Joan. Hell's a sweet place, If it be dark. Per. What, is the Devil in thee? Joan. Not in me; but the Devil's in my Husband, He's run stark staring mad, and plays the Devil When he sees any Light, Sir: he struck out My eldest Daughter's Eyes, because he said They sparkled: and my Nose was almost levell'd (Pray feel, I wear a Patch) because 'twas tipt, Onely a little sprinkled with my Bottle, And he cri'd, 'twas a-fire. Per. Then you've no fire? Joan. Nor Candle, Sir, Glow-worm, nor Rotten wood, Not any thing that shines, besides my Nose, (And that's under a Cloud) but, Captain, you Know the old way to your Bed. Per. I'l lead thee, Dear. Joan. Is not your Rundlet of Sack well bestow'd? [to Gioseppe. Gio. Would 'twere a Hogshead for thee, old Shee-Bully. Per. Why com'st not on? Dia. Oh softly; the raw Air Has made my Head ake, as 'twould flie to pieces, And talking makes it worse: sweet Captain, ask No Questions, for then I'm oblig'd to Answer; But quietly to bed. Per. With all my heart. [Exeunt Per. &amp; Men. Gio. &amp; Joan. Dia. Grand-father, you must watch the Greek Impostress. Or else she'l carry away the Bag of Gold; I go a Bride-groom-catching, my old Servant, The Prince shall help me. Fil. And the Gold shall meet thee. [Exeunt. Enter Pyramena. Py. A woman, sure, has two Souls, the one Noble, Th'other Base, and I've lost my Noble Soul, Or else could Pyramena (that scorn'd life This morning) now at night fear, like a Child, The Bug-bear we call Death; say he should come, Death only comes with terrour to the Happie, To me he brings a Blessing, begg'd in vain By thousands, which, like me, have need to die; Alas! Death hears not, when the Wretched crie. But I've more need to live, that I may get A pardon for a Sin, but little less Than Perjury, and yet I saw it not (Ev'n when it pull'd down ruine on my head) So long as Spleen and Self-will blinded me, Till Misery open'd my eyes: and now I shall not see his face that would forgive me? Enter Iberio in his Gorget, Arviedo following. How I belie my Happiness! he's here; Oh! O Iberio. [she kneels. Iber. Fie, Pyramena, Why do you kneel to me? Py. I must not rise, Till you pronounce my pardon. Iber. For what fault? Py. You speak, as if I would out-face it still; For the most foul of all faults, breach of Faith, For passing to another Man your Right, Your Pyramena. Iber. Rise, I pardon thee. Py. But will Iberio love me? Iber. As a Friend. Py. Not as a Wife? Iber. You are another's now: You know I've forfeited my Right in you. Py. In my own words most justly I am answer'd. Peace of Soul, all Delights that make Life sweet, Be with you. Iber. Stay, there's something in thy Eyes That makes thy wishes ineffectual, Thou look'st wild. Py. Why should you concern your self How I look? do you think Ãneas car'd How Dido look'd, when she saw him Imbark? Iber. The Clay a Lover's made of, will not mould A politician; I can bend my brow No longer. 'Tis thy Wedding-night, and yet Not Bed-time: thou art still untouch'd? Py. A Virgin. Iber. Then thou art mine, I will put in my Claim At Rome; the Court, the Rota, must declare Us Man and Wife, thither I'l send the Case By the Pope's Galley, which to morrow morning Leaves the Fleet, and Tacks off for Ostia, To give our Holy Father an account Of our Venetian Levies; till we have The Judgment of the Court, we'l live in Candy. Arv. Talk, when you're safe out of his dangerous place. Madam, I can fit you with a disguise. Iber. No, Pyramena, boldly shew your face, For if the Porter question us I'l kill him. Iberio draws, as he leads off Pyramena, Corbulo and Vindex enter with Fire-locks in their hands. Cor. The Porter stands as fair to shoot your Lordship, Unless you yield (and presently) to mercy; We give no quarter. Iber. Villain, shoot. Py. Hold, Soldier; Since I see, my perfidious Crime against This Lord, must have Expiatory blood, Kill me. Cor. You shall be talkt withall anon: Will you lay down your sword? 'tis your last Summons. Iber. My Sword was made for no base hand. I'l die Thus, like a Soldier: die thou, like a Murd'rer, Broke on the Wheel. Py. Hold, Oh hold! By these Tears, By your recover'd first-love I conjure you, Yield to your cruel Fortune, not to Them: Yield, or they shoot me. She runs to Iberio, stands before him, and exposes her breast for his. Iber. Thou art safe. There, Slaves, [he flings down his sword. 'Tis she that has disarm'd me. Enter Decio. Dec. Now, a man May bid my Lord welcome, (without a Dance) To's own, not his Wife's House; and loving Wife (Whether you are his Wife, or mine) you shall Embrace no more; bind both their arms, and bear 'em [Cor. and Vindex bind the three Prisoners. To th'place of Execution. Iber. What death? Dec. Such notice as thou gav'st my murder'd Sister Of that base Robbery, when thou stol'st thy self From her at Venice, I mean to give thee Of the Intrigue of her Revenge. But know, Before she di'd, I promis'd Ericina To kill thee in the Joys of thy new Love; Therefore when you and Pyramena quarrel'd, I held my hand, forbore to poison you, And from her Hatred to your Jealous Nature, Won her to marry me or my Free humour; Then gave you way to reconcile your selves, That so I might get you into my power. Go thou, and marry her in the other world. Bear 'em to death. Vin. Let him; I will not stir, Unless 't be to unbind them. Dec. Dar'st thou talk? Vin. Freelier yet; set them at Liberty, Or I'l unriddle You: did not these hands Bury the Body ofâ Cor. Brav'd by a Slave? Corbulo disarms Vindex, and offers to knock out his Brains. Dec. Hold thy hand Corbulo: Vindex, hear thy doom, Die; or be honest, and live rich and free. Vin. Life's sweet, when handsomely accommodated; Give me my tools again, and let's to work. Iber. Comets, that rise and shine a while like Stars, Will down again and stink: Slaves will be Slaves. Dec. See their last Draught prepar'd, as I directed. Py. Spit out thy Poyson now for both of us. Dec. I'l satisfie your longing. Iber. Arviedo, Discover thy self to him; when he hears Thy name, twill shake the bloody Butcher's Knife Out of his hand. Arv. No, my Lord, I will never Owe my life to your Murd'rer; 'tis my glory I die with you, whose bounteous hand has kept me Thus long alive. Iber. Thou hast the old Man's Soul, Had I his Swordâ Dec. It should save none of you; Yet I've a private kindness for the Youth, I'l bring him to a Priest before he dies; But no Sword shall redeem him from these arms. My long-mock'd Fury, like an Army's rage. That storms a Town, shall spare no Sex, nor Age. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Peralta in his Night-gown. Per. Bless me! (that's more than I have said this sev'n years) Come out old Hag, was't you that cast the Mist Before my eyes? Enter Menanthe, a Sword in her right hand, in her left the Bag of Gold. Me. Yes, Captain-Coxcomb, I; I, brave Sea-Captain, I remov'd the Lights Out of your Admiral: I rais'd the Fog Wherein my Man of War was lost, and all The Gold aboard him shipwrack'd, I left nothing To keep possession for him, not a Cat To spit Fire: but could'st thou not see the Beacons? [She points to her eyes. Per. Fire will take those eyes, Witch, when thou art burn'd, They're now as dark as those rooms yester-night. Well, Night-mare, you have had your pleasure of me, You do not mean to rob me? Me. Keep off, Captain, And do not you fore-speak me; for I mean To rob thee of this Gold, and pay my self, Like Wenches that have wit, for my Night's lodging; Once in my life I'l make prize of a Pirate. Advance, and if I kill thee not, hang me. Per. Let me die, if I don't begin to love Thy wit and spirit above all young flesh; Thou art an old Virago. Me. I have wit And courage enough, Captain, to keep thee From any more embraces, Per. Nay, then be Incredulous at thy peril, twice that Gold Will never purchase such a Bed-fellow. Me. If there were any truth in such a Husband, I like thee for a Bed-fellow, butâ Per. No but, Wu't have me swear? Me. Hast thou not sworn and broke? Per. An Oath for Form-sake meerly, Matrimony Is sworn of course; but now I'l marry thee The Sea-way, as the Duke of Venice marries The Gulf, make all that Gold into a Ring, And cast it into thee. Me. Explain your self. Per. That is, first, as the true Proprietor I'l take the plunder to my self, and then Return thee All. Me. Swear. Per. As I hope to scape Being truss'd at the Main-yard, I'd do't. Me. There's Gold and Sword; and now I hope I please thee. Per. And I'l perform with thee, as the old Romans Did with Tarpeia, who betrai'd for Gold The Capitol: Thou shalt have the full Agreement, All, Gold, and Sword. Me. You will not? Per. Pray, or curse, For to the Pot thou go'st. Me. Then you're a Rogue. Per. Did you doubt that? thus I resolve thee. Me. Help! Enter Officers, Filomarini and Gioseppe, the Officers seize Peralta and Menanthe, Gioseppe takes the bag of Gold. Fil. Fight with your Wife? fie, the Prince of Salerno Would speak with you; look to your Prisoner, He catches at your Bills; I tell thee, Captain, The Prince will only speak, not fight, with thee. Per. Nay, if I must not fight, I will not speak, The torture shall not get out one word more. Fil. Thou hast the Bag? Gio. Yes, the whole Cheat's recover'd. [Exeunt. Enter Salerno and Lugo. Sal. Then thou art cheated, Cousin? Lug. Almost ruin'd. Sal. I would not credit the Report, but now That you confirm it, I am satisfi'd: That's all my business. Lug. You are too Noble To send for me to scorn my wants, I hope You summon me to better my condition. Sal. On easie tearms. Lug. But I have nothing left To make tearms out of. Sal. Is your Bride lost too? Lug. Suppose She were not; think you, I would make Tearms out of Her? Sal. Cousin, you do not love her, That's publick: were it then ill mov'd, to wish You would resign her to me, your near Kinsman, Who lov'd her first? 'tis to give me your trouble; But if you please, sell me your Title to her; To better your Condition, take my Title To the fair House and Lordship (which you know) Near Foro del Volcane. Lug. I am poor, But ere my poverty be wrought upon To make a sale of Love, I'l sterve. A Princeâ Sal. Stay, I perceive I move on a wrong ground, I took't for granted that you lov'd her not. Lug. I was so far from loving (once to day) That nothing was more odious to my heart Than Diacelia. Sal. What has alter'd you? Lug. The lovely Face with the deformed Mind, Leandra, her Impiety reflected Th'Angelical Form of Diacelia's Virtues; Nor is their odds so great between their Beauties, Bating the lustre of the Candian Habit, Leandra stains not Diacelia. Sal. And now you would enjoy her? Lug. Rather her Than all the Earth. Sal. And, Cousin, you shall have her, She plotted this Examination for you; Appear sweet Princess Diacelia. Enter Diacelia in her Veil. Lug. Dear, can you pardon? Dia. Can you love? Lug. For ever. [Sal. Takes off her Veil and discovers the Jewels. Sal. Behold part of your Fortune. Enter Officers, Prisoners, and Gioseppe, who holds up the Bag, and pulls off his false Beard. Gio. The rest's here: And here's an honest Spie, Gioseppe, Master Of the Ship, which to Naples brought from Candy You, Madam, and my Lord Filomarini, By whose command I put to Sea again, Pursu'd the Greek Cheat to Constantinople, Gave her intelligence that a Renegado Meant to inform against her, for imbezling Her Master the Prince of Bulgaria's Jewels, Which did by right of Conquest appertain To the Great Turk: for this Lie she receiv'd me Into her Service: working on her Fears To Genoa I drew her, tic'd her thence With Golden Hopes to Naples. What say'st, Cheat, To prodigal Neopolitans? Me. I say, The hopes of prodigal Neopolitans Could never have got me to bring Leandra To Naples, but that you in your Disguise With your new Spanish name Hosepe (tricks I dream'd not off) fool'd me into belief, That you your self and my Lord Filomarini Were out at Sea upon a second Voyage To Turky in pursute of me, and thus You cheated me as well as I did you, And being quit, I hope you'l pardon me. Gio. The Chest of Damask (which you robb'd me of, When you fled out of Candy) I forgive thee; That only was injury to my self, But, Cheat, you know, there's a great injur'd personâ Enter Filomarini. Fil. The Party's come. Sal. The thousand Crowns are thine; [Exit Fil. Bring her in: bid th'Officers leave the room. [Exeunt Officers and Prisoner. Gio. Clear the room there; my Lord, you and the Princess May tarry, for you'l find your selves concern'd. Enter Filomarini, he gives Leandra to the Prince. Fil. Leandra's yours. Sal. Had you not better been My Mistris of your own accord? you're now Brought as an Offering to my Bed, 'tis ready. Lean. Is your Priest ready too? Sal. For what, I pray? Lean. To make your Princely Bed a Lawful Bed; Into unlawful Sheets I'l never come. Sal. Rogue-Draco, hast not thou ingag'd thy throat? [Fil. discovers himself. Fil. Here, cut it. Sal. Uncle? Is this your Sea-voyage? What meant you? Fli. To reclaim you and my son: He is reform'd; but, Mistris-monger, you Scarce pleas'd with three, four hundred Venuses, Will not this one serve your turn? Sal. Very well. Fil. But here's the spight on't, she'l not be a Mistris. Sal. Faith, Uncle, wert not for some few respects I'd marry her. Fil. I have done my endeavours To joyn you, and Leandra likes you well: What is't obstructs the Match? Sal. Nothing, if you (From being an old Pimp) in an instant can Become a Saint, work Miracles: make her Good-natur'd, and the Cheat her Mother honest. Fil. Bring in the Pris'ners. Enter Officers and Prisoners. Look me in the face, Thou know'st me, and my wrongs; confess the truth And live; orâ [Menanthe kneels. Me. I confess, When the Venetian Fought with the Turk in Candy; my old Master Prince of Bulgaria, so valiantly Charg'd the Mahometans who from's Ancestor Had took the Principality, that he fell Into an Ambush, and receiv'd a hurt Of which he di'd, and by his Will left you (His fellow-Soldier in the Candian War) Guardian to his two Daughters. Sal. How! two Daughters! Fil. What if Leandra now should prove a Princess? Me. I confess, That the Prince put me, his Landress, To wait on's younger Child, Princess Leandra; But when I saw my hopes to raise my self Out of my Masters Treasure, frustrated, By his intrusting you, my Lord; the Jewels Committed to my charge I took away, And stole his lovely Child, upon whose ruines I was resolv'd to build my self a Fortune. But sure the Prince was more to blame than I, For Placing a mean Wretch so near a Princess. Fil. What? have I made a good Land-voyage, Nephew? Am I at home? may Drake now Moor his Ship? Is she good-natur'd, and her Mother honest? Sal. And I most happy in thee, dear Leandra. Lean. I'l answer, like an Oracle, in Heroicks; Most happy in a Wife the Prince may prove, Not in Leandra, she'l have Love for Love. Sal. If you admit of Love upon Love's score, Then I may challenge you. Lean. And thousands more. What share can I expect in such a heart, Where every pretty Mistris claims a Part? Sal. A Passion for all Beauties I must own; But they are all contain'd in you alone. Believe me, for my Word is a Decree. Lean. Did you not pass your word, that You in Me Should be Most Happy, which is Most Untrue: Because I am as Happy, Sir, in You. Sal. This comes off well. No Sun breaks forth so clear As through a Clowd, no Joy as through a Fear. Equally Happy (I confess) we are. Dia., Lug. And equally your Happiness we share. Fil. Captain, if you have anthing to say.â Per. I've made a resolution to say nothing. Fil. Then I'l speak for thee: Lugo, did not I Tell thee at first Peralta was a Knave, A Chearer? To the cozening of thy self Thou art an Accessary, therefore we Must either Punish both, or Pardon both. So Captain, (for that sometimes thou hast been My Camrade) I discharge thy' Imprisonment: But I discharge my Friendship too; be gone: Nay, take your Baggage with you, worthy Captain. But let this be (as Pardons that are got In years of Jubilee) no Incouragement To Vice, though you scape Justice. Per. Not so clearly; For we are still condemn'd to one another. [Exeunt Per. &amp; Me. Fil. The thousand Crowns you owe me, pay Gioseppe, To make up his Reward. Sal. Uncle, I will. Fil. And now that you and my Son have got Ladies, 'Tis time to carry them to Decio's Mask. Sal. Aloon then, Scenes of Mirth we may expect. [Exeunt. Enter Decio and Corbulo. Dec. Rare Poison! how suddenly it dispatch'd them? 'Tis done, and bravely done. Cor. 'Twas bravely suffer'd. Dec. And yet his Lordship stoopt to make a suit. Cor. But how? when Pyramena did resolve To drink first, then Iberio intreated The same Cup might be fill'd again for him: In that request to you he courted her. Dec. I must confess, Man never shew'd more courage. Cor. Nor Woman greater sense of Love, and less Of Death; her last words I shall ne'r forget. Dec. Nor shall the World forget them, for I'l be At charge of setting up their Monument: First, in the Marble shall be grav'd this Title, The Poison'd Lovers, then this Epitaph, Perhaps the Title moves thee not, but hear The Ladies last words, and thou'lt drop a Tear. When fairest Pyramena had drunk up The Poison, and her Lover took the Cup, She said, Not This I've drunk, but That thou art To pledge me, That (Iberio) breaks my heart. Does it not strike thee? Cor. Sadly. Dec. Ha-ha-ha. What if I had their Figures cast in Brass, As they are lying on my Bed, embracing? Th'Object has made me dull, I'l have some mirth, Make ready for the Mask: but first release Arviedo, and to shew that he's no Pris'ner, Give him his Sword: i'th' Gallery I'l meet him. [Exit Corbulo. My spleen abates, I've follow'd it too far. Who's there? Enter Vindex with a Sword in his hand. Vin. I, Vindex. Dec. Ha! Who sent for thee? How dar'st thou press upon our Privacy? What would'st thou have? Vin. Impossibilities, A Line to bound an Infinite, your Rage: There is too much of Tiger's blood in you, I come to let it butâ Dec. To murder me? Help! murder! Vin. Peace or this shall silence you: [Vin. draws. Yet, if you let me alone, I do not come To kill you. Dec. What's th'intention of thy coming? Vin. To keep you from commiting of more murders: You have sent Corbulo for Arviedo; Already I am witness to two proofs Of your strange fury, I'l prevent a third. Dec. Thou wilt not keep me prisoner? Vin. At your peril; You shall not rob the world of a young Worthy. Dec. Know'st thou Arviedo? Vin. No; all's one for that, I hear the Gentleman's a Child of Honour: I pitty him. Dec. I love him. Vin. Who'l believe you? Enter Arviedo and draws his Sword. Arv. Prodigious! a Slave drawn upon his Lord? Thy Sword? Vin. You'l not take from me your Defence? Arv. Villain, defend thy self. Vin. I am too honest, Hear me, or you'l be lost, Sir. Dec. Let him live, Though he surpriz'd me rudely, he meant well: Sirrha, about your business: Arviedo, [Exit Vindex. This was more nobleâ Arv. Than you can imagine. I would not have you fall by your Slave's hand. Dec. My life to Arviedo is a debt. Arv. Pay it, for Decio has liv'd too long. It had been happy for thee, had'st thou di'd Before thy rage (in pois'ning Pyramena And my brave Kinsman) made thee a Wild-beast, Which I must rid the world of. Dec. In your breast There's more of Honour, than to murder one That is (you see) defenceless. Arv. Where's thy Sword? Dec. I'th' Gallery, the place where Corbulo Appointed you to meet: lead, Sir, from me You shall have satisfaction; and the like I shall require from you. Arv. I'l do you right. Ask any thing with your Sword in your hand: I shall be glad to find you so much Man. Dec. How much of Man is in me, you shall trie: I'l make you mine, or by your hand I'l dye. [Exeunt. Enter Corbulo and a Servant, with one-Ey'd Vizards in their hands. Serv. Why one Eye in the fore-head of my Vizard? Cor. Great Puppy, should a Cyclop have two Eyes? On with your Cyclop face, the Masks beginning. Enter Salerno, Leandra, Lugo, Diacelia. The Prince? These Chairs are for you and your Friends, Sir. Sal. Where's Decio? Cor. He'l wait upon your Highness. The Scene Vulcan's Court, over it is writ, Foro del Volcane. Soft Musique. Enter Aurora in a black Veil below. Song in Dialogue. Aur. PhÅbus? PhÅb. Who calls the World's great Light? Aur. Aurora, that abhors the Night. PhÅb. Why does Aurora from her Cloud To drowsie PhÅbus cry so Loud? Aur. Put on thy Beams; rise, (no regard To a young Goddess, that lies hard In th'old Man's bosome?) rise for shame, And shine my Cloud into a Flame. PhÅb. Oblige me not beyond my pow'r, I must not rise before my hour. Aur. Before thy hour? look down, and see, In vain the Persian kneels to thee, And I (mock'd by the glim'ring Shade) A sad mistake in Naples made; Like Pliny I had lost my life, If I had been a Mortal Wife. PhÅb. Thou cam'st too near the Burning Mount Vesuvio? Aur. Upon thy account, For I took Clouds of Smoke and Fire, (VVhich here from Vulcan's Court expire) For Morning-streaks, Blew, VVhite, and Red, That Rouse me from cold Tithon's Bed. PhÅbus enters with his Beams on. PhÅb. Charge not upon me for a Crime, That I stai'd th'utmost point of time, Before I would put off my Bays, And on Naples shed my Rays, VVhere such a mischief they have done, As will make Venus hate the Sun, Discovering to Vulcan's eye VVhere she and Mars embracing lie. Aur. I'm sorry Mars and Venus had Such Privacy: but I am glad That PhÅbus does at last appear To shine away Aurora's Fear. PhÅb. What frighted thee? Aur. I know not what; But thou know'st all; what noise is that? Within Vulcan roars out, No work, Rogues? PhÅb. 'Tis Vulcan, in a greater Heat Than th'Irons by his Cyclops beat: He makes the horrour of that noise Teaching and Knocking his great Boys, (From hamm'ring out Jove's Thunder) set To File and Polish Vulcan's Net, Which he'l catch Mars and Venus in. Aur. What now? [Laughing within. PhÅb. To laugh the Smiths begin: At furious Vulcan (halting off To measure his wife's Bed) they scoff. Aur. I'l leave the place; I can no more Endure the Laughter than the Roar. [Tuning within. PhÅb. Heark, they record, they'l sing anon; 'Tis time for PhÅbus to be gone: For when such Lyrick Asses bray, The God of Musique cannot stay. [Exeunt PhÅbus and Aurora. The Cyclops Song (within) Cry our Ware, (Sooty Fellows, Of the Forge and the Bellows) Has Jove any Oaks to rend? Has Ceres Sickles to mend? Wants Neptune a Water-Fork? All these are the Cyclops work: But to Wire-draw Iron-rods, To File Nets to catch the Gods, What can make our fingers so fine; Drink, drink, Wine, Lippari-wine. Chorus. Smoke, Smoke breeds the Tisick, Wine, Wine's the best Physick, For every Cyclop a full Kan; Our Tearms runs thus, Some Wine for Us, Or no Net for our Master Vulcan. Enter Vulcan with Iron Links in his hand, and a Horse-shoo revers'd on his head, he drives before him the four Cyclops drunk, wearing half-Vizards with one Eye in the Fore-head. Vul. Drink Fire, you Lazie Monsters; Lippari-Wine? No Liquor down with you, but mine? 1 Cycl. We made a shift. Vul. It seems so, for you reel: Is this my Cobweb weav'd in Steel? How horridly it looksâ 2 Cycl. But not so horrid [He points with two fingers at Vul. As Vulcan does, who Shooes his forehead. Vul. With gaping loop-holes, and wrought all awry: My Wife's Pox put out thy one Eye. 3 Cycl. He means her Small-pox, and that seldom misses The Eye, for 'tis a small Ulysses. 4 Cycl. I'l dance my Eye out. Vul. Let who dare advance A step; no Rogues, you shall not dance; I'l lay your legs fast, your heels you may shake In th'Iron Stocks, those you can make. Enter two Cupids, (a White and a Black) with Bows and Forked Arrows, with which they point at Vulcan. 1 Cycl. Not Dance? Cow'rds? here come Cocks that are no dastards; Two Cupids? Y'have a charge of Bastards. 2 Cycl. One for the White Men. 3 Cycl. For the Black another. 4 Cycl. Your Wife's a very fruitful Mother: These Cupids shoot in Cross-bows sure, for they Have forked Arrows? 1 Cycl. Sa, sa, sa; We have our Forks too, and though drunk, yet hearty, We'l joyn with the Malignant Party. Exeunt Cyclops, and after Vulcan and the Cupids have begun the Dance, the Cyclops return with Kans in their hands, they dance and drink. When the Antick's done, all cry, Ware Horns, and then run away, onely the White Cupids stays. Vul. My Hammer? Dogs, your legs have sav'd your brains, Still the European Brat remains Upon the place: Venus's only Joy Come hither, my Wifes fine White Boy: You must change Colours, Sirrha, get a robe As black as Mid-night makes the Globe, Mourn at thy Mother's Funeral, if thou stay'st, Thine shall be firstâ Cup. Hold, I'm in haste. [Exit White Cupid. Vul. I'm so too: my Net I cannot make, 'Tis now Venus's time to wake: Time Vulcan measures by exacter trial Vul. pulls out a steel Watch. Than PhÅbus does on his Sun-dial: A Master in my Art I'm known to be, Though not in the Art of Poetry; My Verse halts like myself but (day and night) My Workmanship, this Watch, goes right. Lean. Why does he look upon this Watch? Sal. It seems There is a Critical Minute Mars and Venus Must wake in. What? my Lord Iberio Iberio and Pyramena discover'd lying on a Bed, at the Bed's feet sits Cupid weeping. Is Mars? Lug. And is not Pyramena Venus? Dia. 'Tis Pyramena; how durst Decio Trust her old Servant? Sal. Cupid Watches them. Lean. Are they not dead? for they look deadly pale. Enter Decio in a Night-Gown, a Sword in his hand, He looks upon Vulcan's VVatch. Dec. Vanish, Impostor; room for the true Vulcan; The Minute's come; wake, Lovers, wake, I say. [Iberio and Pyramena start. Iber. Wake? did we sleep? did we not both drink poison? Dec. Credit the working, 'twas an Opiate, Onely to make you sleep, till your Friends came (Stir not, my Lord, nor call for help, in vain) I sent for your Patron, the Prince, with hope That in his presence you will be asham'd To die, the second time, so sensually Embracing my Wife. Iber. Death shall not part us. Py. This Knot's a Gordian, never to be loos'd. Decio draws his Sword. Dec. It may be cut, the Macedonian way. Sal. Thou dar'st not offer at their Lives? [Sal. and Lugo draw. Dec. And yours, [Decio stamps, the Cyclops enter with Arms. If you protect them; shew your Swords the way Into their Scabbards; mine should be unsheath'd, But I will put it up, and draw my Tongue Before these Judges: will you hear? Sal. Speak freely. Dec. Sir, I invited you, not to assist The Malefactors, but to sit and judge The Equity of my Revenge, and Ladies, Be not afrighted, whatsoe'r I suffer, No Affront shall be offer'd to your Sex. The Pris'ners may (if they except against The Prince and Lugo) make appeal to you. Dia. Speaks he not well? Lean. He looks exceeding well, And if his Cause were good. Dec. First, I charge you, My Lord Iberio, with my Sister's death. Iber. Falsely, I am not guilty. Dec. How? not guilty? Did not my Sister (upon your Ingagement) Send for me (then in Candy) but ere I Could come to Venice, you were got to Naples, And had disown'd her, which perfidiousness Soon after broke her heart. Iber. You do me wrong, To charge her Death upon my breach of promise; Indeed my Father promis'd, I should marry Your Sister Ericina; and if I (Who lov'd this Lady) had declar'd my self, I had been disinherited. My Father Dying of the Pestilence that reign'd in Venice, I wont to settle my Affairs in Naples, And from thence writ your Sister a Discharge. Dec. Of Life. For who could live to be so scorn'd As Ericina was? all Naples call'd her The Slighted Maid: in short, it cost her life; And to revenge her death I came to Naples, Here I past for an insignificant Poet, A Raillier, invited to all Tables, Where I but watch'd an Opportunity To poison you: untill (as luck would have it) You being fool'd out with your Mistris, she Fools in with me; but now that she's my Wife, (Faces about) you are in love again, And make no scruple of Cuckolding poor Decio. Iber. Thou li'st, for Pyramena is as far From any loose, as thou from noble thoughts. Dec. I'l but examine you to that point, then 'Twill appear, who's the liar: were not you Contracted to my Wife? Iber. I was. Dec. Conclude; What the pretension of a Precontract? Were you not preingag'd to Cuckold me? Pray, what am I? Py. Our Executioner; Therefore 'tis to no purpose to dissemble For us that are to dye: I do renounce you, I'l die Iberio's Wife. Decio gives a sign to the Cyclops, they unbind Iberio and Pyramena. Dec. No, I forbid The Banes of Death: you shall live Man and Wife, Your scorn is now sufficiently reveng'd: Behold the Slighted Maid. Decio puts off his Night-gown, &amp; discovers himself to be a VVoman. Iber. Lives Ericina? Sal. What a strange Mother of the Maids is Venice, That breeds such Furies? Dec. But my Brother Decio, (The very night he came to Venice) di'd Of that Mortality which took away My noble Friend, your Father. I conceal'd My Brother's suddain death, and gave it out (Eas'ly believ'd) that your neglect kill'd me; My Brother Decio's Funeral pass'd for mine; In his shape (putting off my Love and Sex) I follow'd you, my Lord, as far as Naples, Here I tri'd several Keys of Death and Fortune, To open me a door to my Revenge; But still compassion stept in to your rescue: Till Hatred springing from your Scorn, was buri'd In love return'd by one of your own blood, Enter Arviedo. The noblest and the sweetest Person living, Who will not slight me, if you like the Match. Iber. So well that Ericina now shall know Which of my Kinsmen she makes choice of; this Is Giulio, Heir to the Family Of Great Gonsalvo; for his poverty Conceal'd, under the name of Arviedo; I bred him, and resolv'd the frowning World Should never know him till he had a Fortune; A noble one fair Ericina brings. Arv. With it I'l serve my Lord, next to my Prince. Sal. Nay, the Kings service will go roundly on; I warrant, she'l bring a whole Nurserie Of Generals, she'l stock thee with young Gonsalvo's. Dec. I'l promise only possibilities; Though I deserve not the Great Captain's Heir, I hope to make him (what has been accepted By King's themselves) a Gentleman of Venice. Judges, can you pardon a Woman's weakness, That will revenge her blushes? Py. I forgive The cruelty of Ericina's Spleen, Which cur'd Iberio's Jealousie. Sal. All's pleas'd With such a fortunate Close. Send for our Coaches, Mean time, let's have a Dance, as your Grand Mask. [They Dance. So, now at the next Chappel we'l be marri'd, Then at my House I'l treat you, where th'Inviter Shall be Leandra's Guest. But still there wants A just Reward for this deserving Soldier, That boldly, at his lowest ebb of Fortune, Durst check a Prince in his carier to Vice. Dec. Who taking me for (what I seem'd) a Man That would have given my Wife a wanton freedom, Advis'd me to be jealous of my Honour; And when he (swearing to do my commands) Knew me to be a VVoman, for his Oath's sake, Against his Nature, he made you my Pris'ner. Iber. I'l do my self the honour to advance him. Sal. Then make him your Lieutenant-Colonel. Iber. I can't, but I'l give him my Regiment, And get the Vice-Roy to Sign his Commission. Dec. And from a Slave, poor Vindex, thou shalt be (As I have promis'd) made both Rich and Free. Iber. Corbulo, manage thou our Candian Arms, The Battel I must fight in, is, at home. Cor. I've not a Courtier's tongue to speak my thanks, But to the Turk I'l sell my blood so dear, I hope the Christian Cause will thank my Raiser For sending me to Candy. My grief is, I've but one Life to lose for the King's Honour. Sal. No, Col'nel, (doubtless) the King's better Stars Will guard thy life, to serve him nearer Spain. Let's all now joy this Military Bride-groom. Patience (thou seest) may lend blind Fortune Eyes To find out Men, and make low Suff'rers rise. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE Spoke by The SLIGHTED MAID. Slighted, you know, I was; but, Gentlemen, Resembling you in Shape and Courage, then I look'd upon it with an angry brow: 'Twould grieve me, if I should be slighted now. But though our Sex the proud Italians scorn, Th'English are Civil, you are Courtiers born, And she's curst in her Cradle, that promotes Her Sute to you, and is deni'd your Votes. Behold your Candidate before you stands: Your Semele sees Thunder in your hands, Let's hear it: Claps that would make some afraid, VVill make the Slighted the Exalted Maid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE TO THE KING. I've spoke before your Majesty, but yet I never kneel'd in such a shaking Fit; For, Sir, the Author bids me kneel and pray Against your Justice: all that he can say In his defence, is, that you would condemn His faults, if strictly you examin'd them. He hopes you will not; and why should he fear? Your Majesty was never yet severe To any thing well-meant, though ill-exprest; And he presumes, you think, he did his best To please you: therefore 'twould be hard, if he In making for your mirth a Comedy, Should write's own Tragedy; yet that's his Case, If your Impartial Justice should take place; But if your Gracious Favour intervene, The Epilogue is clearly his best Scene.
