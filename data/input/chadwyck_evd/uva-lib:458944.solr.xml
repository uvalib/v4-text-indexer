      <field name="fulltext">THE LITTLE FRENCH LAWYER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scena Prima. Enter Dinant and Cleremont. Din. Disswade me not. Clere. It will breed a braule. Din. I care not, I weare a Sword. Cler. And weare discretion with it, Or cast it off, let that direct your arme, 'Tis madnesse els, not valour, and more base Then to receive a wrong. Din. Why would you have me Sit downe with a disgrace, and thanke the doer? We are not Stoicks, and that passive courage Is onely now, commendable in Lackies, Peasants, and Tradesemen, not in men of ranke, And qualitie, as I am. Cler. Doe not cherish That daring vice, for which the whole age suffers The blood of our bold youth, that heretofore Was spent in honourable action, Or to defend, or to enlarge the Kingdome, For the honour of our Countrey, and our Prince, Poures it selfe out, with prodigall expence Upon our Mothers lap, the Earth that bred us For every trifle, and these private Duells, Which had their first originall from the French; (And for which, to this day, we are justly censured) And banisht from all civill Governments Scarce three in Venice, in as many yeares; In Florence, they are rarer, and in all The faire Dominions of the Spanish King, They are never heard of: Nay, those neighbour Countries, Which gladly imitate our other follies, And come at a deare rate to buy them of us, Begin now to detest them. Din. Will you? and yet— Cler. And I have heard, that some of our late Kings, For the lie, wearing of a Mistris, feathers; A cheate at Cards or Dice and such like causes, Have lost as many gallant Gentlemen, As might have met the great Turke in the field With confidence of a glorious Victorie, And shall we then— Din. No more, for shame no more, Are you become a Patron to? 'tis a new one, No more on't, burn't, give it to some Orator, To help him to enlarge his exercise, With such a one, it might doe well, and profit The Curat of the Parish, but for Cleremont The bold, and under-taking Cleremont, To talke thus to his friend, his friend that knowes him, Dinant, that knowes his Cleremont, is absurd, And meere Apocripha. Cler. Why, what know you of me? Din. Why if thou hast forgot thy selfe, I'll tell thee, And not looke backe, to speake of what thou wert At fifteene, for at those yeares, I have heard Thou wast flesh'd, and enter'd bravely. Cler. Well sir, well. Din. But yesterday, thou wast the common second, Of all that onely knew thee, thou hadst bills Set up on every post, to give thee notice, Where any difference was, and who were parties, And as, to save the charges of the Law; Poore men seeke Arbitrators, thou wert chosen By such as knew thee not, to compound quarrells: But thou wert so delighted with the sport, That if there were no just cause, then wouldst make one, Or be engag'd thy selfe: This godly calling Thou hast followed five and twenty yeares, and studied The Criticismes of contentions, and art thou In so few houres transform'd? certaine this night Thou hast had strange dreames, or rather visions. Cler. Yes, Sir, I have seene fooles, and fighters, chain'd together, And the Fighters had the upper hand, and whipt first, The poore Sotts laughing at 'em. What I have bin It skils not, what I will be is resolv'd on. Din. Why then you'll fight no more? Cler. Such is my purpose. Din. On no occasion? Cler. There you stagger me, Some kind of wrongs there are, which flesh and blood Cannot endure. Din. Thou wouldst not willingly, Live a protested coward, or be call'd one? Cler. Words, are but words. Din. Nor would'st thou take a blow? Cler. Not from my friend, though drunke, and from an enemy, I thinke much lesse. Din. There's some hope of thee left then, Wouldst thou heare me, behind my back disgrac'd? Cler. Do you think I am a rogue? they that should do it Had better bin borne dumbe. Din. Or in thy presence? See me o're-charg'd with odds? Cler. I'd fall my selfe first. Din. Would'st thou endure thy Mistris be taken from thee, And thou sit quiet? Cler. There you touch my honour, No French man can endure that. Din. Pl? upon thee, Why dost thou talke of Peace then? that dar'st suffer Nothing, or in thy selfe, or in thy friend That is unmanly? Cler. That I grant, I cannot: But I'll not quarrell with this Gentleman, For wearing stammell Breeches, or this Gamester, For playing a thousand pounds, that owes me nothing; For this mans taking up a common Wench In raggs, and lowsie, then maintaining her Caroached in cloth of Tissue, nor five hundred Of such like toyes, that at no part concerne me; Marry, where my honour, or my friend is questioned, I have a Sword, and I thinke I may use it To the cutting of a Rascalls throat, or so, Like a good Christian. Din. Thou art of a fine Religion, And rather then we'll make a Schisme in friendship, I will be of it: But to be serious, Thou art acquainted with my tedious love-suit To faire Lamira. Cler. Too well Sir, and remember Your presents, courtship, that's too good a name, Your slave-like services, your morning musique; Your walking three houres in the raine at midnight, To see her at her window, sometimes laugh'd at Sometimes admitted, and vouchsaf'd to kisse Her glove, her skirt, nay, I have heard, her slippers, How then you triumph'd? Here was love forsooth. Din. These follies I deny not, Such a contemptible thing, my dotage made me, But my reward for this— Cler. As you deserv'd For he that makes a goddesse of a Puppet, Merits no other recompence. Din. This day friend, For thou art so— Cler. I am no flatterer. Din. This proud, ingratefull she, is married to Lame Champernell. Cler. I know him, he has bin As tall a Sea-man, and has thriv'd as well by't, The losse of a legg and an Arme deducted, as any That ever put from Marseils: you are tame, Pl? on't, it mads me; if it were my case, I should kill all the family. Din. Yet but now You did preach patience. Cler. I then came from confession, And 't was enjoyn'd me three houres for a pennance, To be a peaceable man, and to talke like one, But now, all else being pardon'd, I begin On a new Tally, Foot doe anything, I'll second you. Din. I would not willingly Make red, my yet white conscience, yet I purpose In the open street, as they come from the Temple, (For this way they must passe,) to speake my wrongs, And doe it boldly. Musick playes. Cler. Were thy tongue a Cannon, I would stand by thee, boy, they come upon 'em. Din. Obserue a little first. Cler. This is fine sidling. Enter Vertaigne, Champernell Lamira, Nurse; Beaupre Verdoone. An Epithalamin Song at the Wedding. Come away bring on the Bride And place her by her Lovers side: You faire troope of Maides attend her, Pure, and holy thoughts befriend her. Blush, and wish, you Virgins all, Many such faire nights may fall. Chorus. Hymen, fill the house with joy, All thy sacred fires employ: Blesse the Bed with holy love, Now faire or be of Beauty move. Din. Stand by, for 'twill be heard. Verta. This is strange rudenesse. Din. 'Tis courtship, ballanced with injuries, You all looke pale with guilt, but I will dy Your cheekes with blushes, if in your sear'd veines, There yet remaine so much of honest blood To make the colour; first to ye my Lord, The Father of this Bride, whom you have sent Alive into her grave. Champ. How? to her grave? Dina. Be patient sir, I'll speake of you anon, You that allowed me liberall accesse, To make my way with service, and approv'd of My birth, my person, yeares, and no base fortune: You that are rich, and but in this held wise too, That as a Father should have look'd upon Your Daughter in a Husband, and aim'd more At what her youth, and heat of blood requir'd In lawfull pleasures, then the parting from Your Crownes to pay her dowre: you that already Have one foot in the grave, yet study profit, As if you were assur'd, to live here ever; What poore end had you, in this choice? in what Deserve I your contempt? my house, and honours, At all parts equall yours, my fame as faire, And not to praise my selfe, the City rankes me, In the first file, of her most hopefull Gentry: But Champernell is rich, and needs a nurse, And not your gold: And add to that, he's old too, His whole estate in likelihood, to descend Upon a Family; Here was providence, I grant, but in a Nobleman, base thrift: No Merchants, nay, no Pirats, sell for Bondmen. Their Countrey-men, but you, a Gentleman, To save a little gold have sold your Daughter To worse then slaverie. Cler. This was spoke home indeed. Beau. Sir, I shall take some other time to tell you, That this harsh language, was delivered to An old man, but my Father. Din. At your pleasure. Cler. Proceed in your designe, let me alone, To answer him, or any man. Verd. You presume Too much upon your name, but may be cousin'd. Din. But for you, most unmindfull of my service, For now I may upbraid you, and with honour, Since all is lost, and you I am a gainer, In being deliver'd from a torment in you, For such you must have bin, you to whom nature Gave with a liberall hand, most excellent forme, Your education, language, and discourse, And judgement to distinguish when you shall With feeling sorrow, understand how wretched And miserable, you have made your selfe, And but your selfe, have nothing to accuse, Can you with hope from any beg compassion? But you will say, you serv'd your Fathers pleasure, Forgetting that unjust commands of Parents Are not to be obey'd or that you are rich, And that to wealth, all pleasure els are servants, Yet but consider, how this wealth was purchas'd, 'Twill trouble the possession. Champ. You sir know I got it, and with honour. Din. But from whom? Remember that, and how: you'll come indeed To houses bravely furnish'd, but demanding Where it was bought, this souldier will not lie, But answer truly, this rich cloth of Arras, I made my prize in such a Ship, this Plate Was my share in another; these faire Jewells, Comming a shore, I got in such a Village, The Maid, or Matron kill'd, from whom they were ravish'd, The Wines you drinke, are guilty too, for this, This Candie Wine, three Merchants were undone, These Suckets breake as many more, in briefe, All you shall weare, or touch, or see, is purchas'd By lawlesse force, and you but revell in The teares, and grones, of such as were the owners. Champ. 'Tis false, most basely false. Verta. Let loosers talke. Din. Lastly, those joyes, those best of joyes, which Hymen Freely bestowes on such, that come to tye The sacred knot he blesses, wonne unto it By equall love, and mutuall affection, Not blindly led, with the desire of riches, Most miserable you, shall never taste of, This Marriage night, you'll meet a Widowes bed, Or failing of those pleasures, all Brides looke for, Sinne in your wish it were so, Champ. Thou art a Villaine, A base, malitious slanderer. Cler. Strike him. Din. No, he is not worth a blow. Champ. O that I had thee In some close vault that onely would yeild roome To me to use my Sword, to thee no hope To run away, I would make thee on thy knees, Bite out the tongue that wrong'd me. Verta. Pray you have patience. Lamira. This day I am to be your Soveraigne, Let me command you. Champ. I am lost with rage, And know not what I am my selfe, nor you: Away, dare such as you, that love the smoke Of peace, more then the fire of glorious Warre, And like unprofitable drones, feed on Your grandsires laboures, that as I am now, Were gathering Bees, and fil'd their Hive, this Country With brave triumphant spoiles, censure our Actions? You object my prizes to me, had you seene The horrour of a Sea-fight, with what danger I made them mine; the fire I fearelesse fought in, And quench'd it in mine enemies blood, which straight Like Oyle pour'd out on't, made it burne anew; My Deck blowne up, with noise enough to mocke The lowdest thunder, and the desperate fooles That Boorded me, sent to defie the tempest That were against me to the angrie Sea, Frighted with men throwen ore; no victory, But in despight of the foure Elements, The Fire the Ayre, the Sea, and sands hid in it To be atchiev'd, you would confesse poore men, (Though hopelesse, such an honourable way To get or wealth, or honour) in your selves; He that through all these dreadfull passages, Pursued and overtooke them, unafrighted, Deserves reward, and not to have it stil'd By the base name of theft. Din. This is the Courtship, That you must looke for, Madam. Cler. 'Twill doe well, When nothing can be done, to spend the night with: Your tongue is sound, good Lord, I could wish For this young Ladyes sake this leg, this arme, And there is something els I will not name, (Though 'tis the onely thing that must content her) Had the same vigour. Champ. You shall buy these scoffes With your best blood helpe me once noble anger, (Nay stirre not, I alone must right my selfe) And with one leg transport me to correct These scandalous praters: ô that noble wounds Falls. Should hinder just revenge? D'ye jeere me too? I got these not as you doe your diseases In Brothells, or with riotous abuse Of wine in Tavernes; I have one leg shot, One arme disabled, and am honour'd more, By loosing them, as I did in the face Of a brave enemy then if they were As when I put to Sea; you are French men onely, In that you have bin laied, and cur'd, goe to: You mock my leg but every bone about you, Makes you good Almanack-makers, to foretell What wether we shall have. Din. Put up your Sword. Cler. Or turne it to a Crutch, there't may be usefull, And live, on the relation to your Wife, Of what a brave man you were once. Din. And tell her, What a fine vertue, 'tis in a young Lady To give an old man pap. Cler. Or hire a Surgeon To teach her to roule up your broken limbes. Din. To make a Pultesse, and endure the sent Of oiles and nasty Plaisters. Vert. Fie sir, fie, You that have stood all dangers of all kinds, To yeild to a rivalls scoffe? Lamira. Shed teares upon Your Wedding day? this is unmanly Gentlemen. Champ. They are teares of anger ô that I should live To play the woman thus? All powerfull heaven, Restore me, but one houre, that strength agen, That I had once, to chastise in these men, Their follies, and ill manners, and that done, When you please, I'll yeild up the fort of life, And doe it gladly. Cler. We ha' the better of him, We ha' made him crye. Verdo. You shall have satisfaction, And I will doe it nobly, or disclaime me. Beaup. I say no more you have a Brother, Sister, This is your Wedding day, we are in the streete, And howsoever, they forget their honour, 'Tis fit I loose not mine, by their example. Verta. If there be Lawes in Paris looke to answer This insolent affront Cler. You that live by them, Study 'em for heavens sake; for my part I know not Nor care not what they are, Is their ought els That you would say? Din. Nothing, I have my ends, Lamira weepes, I have said too much I feare; So dearely once I lov'd her, that I cannot Endure to see her teares. Exiunt. Dionant and Cleremont. Champ. See you performe it, And doe it like my Nephew. Verdo. If I faile in't Nere know me more, Cousen Beupre Champ. Repent not What thou hast done, my life, thou shalt not find I am decrepit; in my love, and service, I will be young, and constant, and beleeve me, For thou shall find it true, in scorne of all The scandalls these rude men have throwne upon me I'le meete thy pleasures, with a young mans ardour And in all circumstances, of a Husband, Performe my parts. Lamira. Good Sir, I am your servant, And 'tis too late now, if I did repent, (Which as I am a virgin yet, I doe not) To undoe the knot, that by the Church is tyed Onely I would beseech ye, as you have, A good opinion of me, and my vertues, For so you have pleas'd to stile my innocent weakenes, That what hath pass'd between Dinant and me, Or what now in your hearing he hath spoken, Beget not doubts, or feares. Champ. I apprehend you, You thinke I will be jealous, as I live Thou art mistaken sweet; and to confirme it Discourse with whom thou wilt, ride where thou wilt, Feast whom thou wilt, as often as thou wilt, For I will have no other guards upon thee Then thine owne thoughts, Lamira. I'le use this liberty With moderation Sir, Beaup. I am resolv'd Steale off, i'le follow you, Champ. Come Sir, you droope, Till you find cause, which I shall never give Dislike not of your son in Law, Verta. Sir, You teach me The language I should use; I am most happy In being so neere you. Exeunt Verdone and Beaupre. Lamira. O my feares good nurse Follow my Brother unobserv'd and learne, Which way he takes. Nurs. I will be carefull Madam. Exit Nurse. Cham. Betweene us complements are superfluous, One Gentlemen, th'affront we have met here Wee'l thinke upon hereafter, 'twere unfit To cherish any thought to breed unrest, Or to our selves, or to our Nuptiall feast. Exeunt. Enter Dinant and Cleremont. Cler. We shall have sport, ner fear't Din. What sport I prithee? Cler. Why we must fight, I know it, and I long for't It was apparent in the fiery eye, Of young Verdoone, Beaupre look'd pale and shooke too, Familiar signes of anger. They are both brave fellowes Tride and approv'd, and I am prou'd to encounter. With men, from whom no honour can be lost They will play up to a man, and set him off, When ere I goe to the field, heaven keepe me from The meeting of an unflesh'd youth or Coward, The first to get a name, comes on too hot, The Coward is so swift in giving ground, There is no overtaking him, without A hunting Nag, well breath'd too. Din. All this while, You ne'r thinke on the danger, Cler. Why 'tis no more, Then meeting of a dousen Friends at Supper, And drinking hard; mischeif comes there unlook'd for, I am sure as suddaine, and strikes home as often, For this we are prepar'd Din. Lamira Loves Her Brother Beaupre dearely. Cler. What of that? Din. And should he call me'to account for what But now I speake, nor can I with mine honour Recant my words, that little hope is left me, 'Ere to enjoye what (next to heaven I long for,) Is taken from me, Cler. Why what can you hope for, She being now married? Din. On my Cleremont, To you all secrets of my heart lye open, And I rest most secure that whatsoer'e I locke up there, is as a private thought, And will no farther wrong me, I am a Frenchman, And for the greater part, we are borne Courtiers, She is a woman, and how ever yet, No heat of service, had the power to melt Her frozen Chastity, time and opportunitie May worke her to my ends, I confesse ill ones, And yet I must pursue 'em: now her marriage, In probabilitie, will no way hurt, But rather help me, Cler. Sits the wind there? pray you tell me How farr off, dwells your love from lust? Din. Too neere, But prithee chide me not, Cler. Not I, goe on boye, I have faults my self, and will not reprehend A crime I am not free from: for her Marriage, I doe esteeme it (and most batchellors are Of my opinion) as a faire protection, To play the wanton, without losse of honour. Din. Would she make rise of't so, I were most happy. Cler. No more of this, Judge now, Whither I have the guift of prophecie. Enter Beaupre and Verdoone. Beaup. Monsieur Dinant. I am glad to find you, Sir. Din. I am at your service. Verd. Good Monsieur Cleremont, I have long wish'd To be knowne better to you, Cler. My desires Embrace your wishes Sir, Beaup. Sir, I have ever Esteem'd you truly noble, and professe. I should have bin most proud, to have had the honour, To call you Brother, but my Fathers pleasure Denied that happinesse, I know no man lives, That can command his passions, and therefore Dare not condemne, the late intemperate language You were pleas'd to use, to my Father and my Sister Hee's old and flie a woman, I most sortie, My honour does compell me to entreat you, To doe me the favour, with your sword to meete me A mile without the Citie. Din. You much honour me. In the demand, I'l gladly waite upon you, Beaup. O Sir you teach me what to say: the time? Din. With the next Sun, if you thinke fit. Beaup. The place. Din. Nere to the vineyard eastward from the Citie. Beaup. I like it well, this gentleman if you please Will keepe me company, Cler. That is agreed on; And in my friends behalf I will attend him Verd. You shall not misse my service. Beaup. Good day Gentlemen. Ex. Beaup. and Verdoone. Din. At your Commandement. Cler. Prou'd to be your servants, I thinke there is no Nation under heaven That cut their enemies throates with complement, And such fine trickes as we doe: If you have Any few Prayers to say, this night you may Call 'em to mind and use 'em, for my self, As I have little to loose, my care is lesse, So till to morrow morning, I bequeath you, To your devotions; and those payed, but use That noble courage I have seene, and we Shall fight, as in a Castle, Din. Thou art all honour, Thy resolution, would steele a Coward, And I most fortunate, in such a Friend, All tendernesse, and nice respect of woman, Be now far from me, reputation take A full possession of my heart, and prove Honour the first place holds, the second love. Exeunt. Enter Lamira, Charlote. Lamir. Sleepes my Lord still Carlote. Char. Not to be wak'd By your Ladiships cheerefull lookes, I well perceive That this night, the good Lord hath bin At an unusuall service, and no wonder If he rest after it Lamir. You are very bold Char. Your Creature Madam and when you are pleas'd Sadnesse to me's a stranger, your good pardon If I speake like a foole, I could have wisht, To have taine your place to night, had bold Dinant Your first and most obsequious servant tasted Those delicates, which by his lethargie As it appeares, have cloyed my Lord, Lamira. No more. Charl. 'T an silenc'd Madam Lamira. Saw you my nurse this morning? Charl. No Madam. Lamira. I am full of feares. Knock within. Who's that? Charl. She you enquir'd for Lamira. Bring her in, and leave me. Ex. Charlote. Now nurse what newes. Enter Nurse. Nurse. O Ladie dreadfull ones, They are to fight this morning, ther's no remedie I saw my Lord your Brother, and Verdoone. Take horse as I came by, Lamir. Wher's Cleremont? Nurse. I met him too, and mounted. Lamir. Wher's Dinant? Nurse. There's all the hope, I have staied him with a tricke, If I have done well so, Lamir. What tricke? Nurse. I 'tould him, Your Ladiship layed your command upon him, To attend you presently, and to confirme it, Gave him the ring' he oft hath seene you weare, That you bestowed on me; he waites without Disguis'd, and if you have that power in him, As I presume you have, it is in you To stay or alter him. Lamir. Have you learnt the place, Where they are to encounter? Nurse. Yes 'tis where The Duke of Burgundie, met Lewis th'eleventh Lamir. Enough I will reward thee liberally, Ex. Nurse. Goe bring him in, full deare I lov'd Dinant, While it was lawfull, but those fires are quenched, I being now anothers, truth forgive me And let dissimulation, be no crime, Though most unwillingly, I put it on To guard a Brothers safetie. Enter Dinant. Dina. Now your pleasure, Though ill you have deserv'd it, you persev'd I am still your foole, and cannot but obey What ever you command Lamir. You speake as if You did repent it, and 'tis not worth my thankes then, But there has bin a time, in which you would Receive this as a favour Din. Hope was left then Of recompence. Lamir. Why I am still Lamira. And you Dinant and 'tis yet in my power I dare not say, i'll put it into act, To reward your love and service, Din. Ther's some comfort, Lamir. But thinke not that so low I przie my fame, To give it up to any man that refuses To buy it, or with danger or performance Of what I shall enjoine him, Din. Name that danger Be it of what horrid shape soever Ladie Which I will shrinke at; only at this instant Be speedie in't Lamir. I'll put you to the triall: You shall not fight today, doe you start at that? Not with my Brother, I have heard your difference, Mine is no Helens beauty, to be purchas'd With blood, and so defended if you looke for Favours from me, deserve them with obedience, Ther's no way els to gain 'em Din. You command What with mine honour I cannot obey Which lies at pawne against it and a friend Equally deare as that, or life engag'd, Not for himself, but me. Lamir. Why, foolish man, Dare you sollicite me, to serve your lust, In which not onely, I abuse my Lord, My father, and my family, but write whore, Though not upon my forhead, in my conscience, To be read howerly, and yet name your honours? Yours suffer but in circumstance; mine in substance, If you obey me, you part with some credit, From whom? the giddy multitude; but mankind Will censure me, and justly Din. I will loose, What most I doe desire, rather then hazard So deare a friend, or write my selfe a coward, 'Tis better be no man Lamir. This will not doe; Why I desire not, you should be a coward, Nor doe I weigh my Brothers life with yours, Meete him, fight with him, doe, and kill him fairely, Let me not suffer for you, I am carelesse. Din. Suffer for me? Lamir. For you, my kindnesse to you, Already brands me, with a strumpets name, Din. O that I knew the wretch! Lamir. I will not name him, Nor give you any Character to know him; But if you dare, and instantly ride foorth At the west port of the City, and defend there My reputation, against all you meete, For two houres on'ly, i'l not sweare Dinant, To satisfie, (though sure I thinke I shall) What ever you desire, if you denie this Be desperate, for willingly, by this light, I'l never see thee more Din. Two houres, doe you say? Lamir. Only two houres, Dina. I were no Gentleman, Should I make scruple of it; this favour armes me, And boldly il' performe it. Exit. Lamir. I am glad on't. This will prevent their meeting yet, and keepe My Brother safe, which was the marke I shott at. Exeunt.</field>

I am first i'th field that honours gain'd of our side Pray Heaven I may get of as honourablie, The houre is past, I wonder Dinant comes not, This is the place, I cannot see him yet; It is his quarrell too, that brought me hither, And I ne'r knew him yet, but to this honour, A firme and worthy Friend, yet I see nothing, Nor Horse nor man; 'twould vex me, to be left here, To th mercy of two swords, and two approved ones I never knew him last.

All I desire of ye, Is to take the quarrell to your selfe, and let me heare no more on't I have no liking to't, 'tis a foolish matter, And help me to put up my Sword. Cler. Most willingly, But I am bound to gratifie you, and I must not leave you. La-writ. I tell you I will not be gratified, Nor I will heare no more on't: take the Swords too, And doe not anger me but leave me quietly. For the matter of honour, 'tis at your owne disposure, And so, and so. Cler. This is a most rare Lawyer: I am sure most valiant. Well Dinant as you satisfie me, I say no more: I am loden like an Armorer. Exit. Cler. Enter Dinant. Din. To be dispatcht upon a sleevelesse errand? To leave my friend engag'd, mine honour tainted? These are trim things. I am set here like a Perdue, To watch a fellow, that has wrong'd my Mistris, A scurvy fellow, that must passe this way, But what this scurvy fellow is, or whence, Or whether his name be William or John, Or Anthony or Dick or anything, I know not; A scurvy rascally fellow. I must aime at, And there's the office of an Asse flung on me. Sure Cleremont has fought, but how come off, And what the world shall thinke of, me hereafter: Well, woman, woman, I must looke your rascalls, And loose my reputation: ye have a fine power over us. These two long houres I have trotted here, and curiously Survei'd all goers by, yet find no rascall. Nor any face to quarrell with: La-writ sings within then Enters. What's that? This is a rascaly voice sure it comes this way. La-writ. He strooke so hard the Bason broke And Tarquin heard the sound. Din. What master thing is this? let me survey it. La-writ. And then he strooke his necke in two. Din. This may be a rascall, but 'tis a mad rascall, What an Alphabet of faces he puts on? Hey how it fences? if this should be the rogue, As 'tis the likeliest rogue I see this day— Lawr. Was ever man for Ladies sake? down, down. Di. And what are you good sir? down, down, down, down. La-wr. What's that to you, good sir? downe, downe. Din. A pox on you good, sir, downe, downe, downe. You with your Buckram bag, what make you here? And from whence come you? I could fight with my shadow now. La-w. Thou fierce man, that like sir Lancelot dost appear, I need not tell thee what I am, nor eke what I make here. Din. This is a pretious knave, stay, stay, good Tristram, And let me aske thy mightinesse a question, Did ye never abuse a Lady? La-writ. Not; to abuse a Lady, is very hard, sir, Din. Say you so, sir? Didst thou never abuse her honour? La-writ. Not; to abuse her honour, is impossible. Din. Certaine this is the rascall: What's thy name? La-writ. My name is Cock a two, use me respectively. I will be Cocke of three else. Din. What's all this? You say, you did abuse a Lady; La-writ. You ly. Din. And that you wrong'd her honour. La-writ. That's two lyes, Speake suddenly, for I am full of businesse. Din. What art thou, or what canst thou be, thou pengoose, That dar'st give me the ly thus? thou mak'st me wonder. Law. And wonder on, till time makes all this plaine. Din. You must not part so, sir, art thou a gentleman? La-w. Aske those, upon whose ruines, I am mounted. Din. This is some Cavellero Knight o'th' Sun. La-w. I tell thee, I am as good a gentleman as the Duke; I have atchieved—goe follow thy businesse. Din. But for this Lady, sir— La-writ. Why, hang this Lady, sir, And the Lady Mother too, sir, what have I to do with Ladies? Enter Cleremont. Cler. 'Tis the little Lawyers voice: has he got my way? It should be here abouts. Din. Ye dry bisket rogue, I wil so swinge you for this blasphemie— Have I found you out? Cler. That should be Dinants tongue too. La-w. And I defy thee do thy worst: ô ho quoth Lancelot tho. And that thou shalt know, I am a true gentleman, And speake according to the phrase triumphant; Thy Lady, is a scurvy Lady, and a shitten Lady, And though I never heard of her, a deboshed Lady, And thou, a squire of low degree; will that content thee? Dost thou way-lay me with Ladies? A pretty sword, sir, A very pretty sword, I haue a great mind to't. Din. You shall not loose your longing, rogue. Cler. Hold, hold. Hold Dinant, as thou art a gentleman. La-writ. As much as you will, my hand is in now. Cler. I am your friend, sir: Dinant you draw your sword Upon the gentleman, preserv'd your honour: This was my second and did back me nobly, For shame forbeare. Din. I aske your mercy, sir, and am your servant now. La-writ. May we not fight then? Cler. I am sure you shall not now. La-w. I am sorry for't I am sure I'le stay no longer then. Not a jot longer: are there any more on ye afore? I will sing still, sir. Exit La-writ. Din. I looke now you should chide me, and 'Tis fit, And with much bitternesse, expresse your anger, I have deserv'd: yet when you know—. Cler. I thanke ye, Doe you thinke, that the wrong you have offred me, The most unmanly wrong, unfriendly wrong— Din. I doe confesse— Cler. That boyish sleight— Din. Not so, sir. Cler. That poore, and base renouncing of your honour, Can be allaied with words? Din. I give you way still. Cler. Coloured with smooth excuses? Was it a friends part, A Gentlemans, a mans that weares a Sword, And stands upon the point of reputation, To hide his head, then, when his honour call'd him? Call'd him alowd, and lead him to his fortune? To halt and slip the coller? by my life, I would have given my life, I had never knowne thee, Thou hast eaten Canker-like into my judgement With this disgrace, my whole life, cannot heale agiine. Din. This I can suffer too, I find it honest. Cler. Can you pretend an excuse now may absolve you, Or any thing like honest, to bring you off? Ingage me like an Asse? Din. Will you but heare me? Cler. Expose me like a Jade, to tug, and hale through, Laugh'd at, and almost hooted? your disgraces, Invite mens Swords, and angers to dispatch me. Din. If you will be patient. Cler. And be abus'd still: But that I have call'd thee friend, And to that name, allow a Sanctuary, You should heare further from me, I would not talk thus: But henceforth stand upon your owne bottome, sir, And beare your owne abuses, I scorne my sword Should travell in so poore and empty quarrells. Din. Ha, you done yet? take your whole swinge of anger, I'le beare all with content. Cler. Why were you absent? Din. You know I am no Coward, you have seene that, And therefore, out of feare, forsooke you not: You know I am not false, of a treacherous nature, Apt to betray my friend I have fought for you too; You know no businesse, that concern'd my state, My kindred, or my life. Cler. Where was the fault then? Din. The honour of that Lady I adore Her credit, and her name: ye know she sent for me, And with what hast. Cler. What was he that traduc'd? Din. The man i'th' Moone, I think, hither I was sent, But to what end— Enter old Lady. Cler. This is a pretty flim-flam. O. La. I am glad I have met you sir, I have bin seeking, And seeking every where. Cler. And now you have found him, Declare that businesse, our Embassadour. O. Lady. What's that to ye good man flouter? O sir, my Lady. Din. Prethee no more of thy Lady, I have too much on't. Cler. Let me have a little, speake to me. Old Lady. To you sir? 'Tis more then time: All occasions set aside sir, Or whatsoever may be thought a businesse— Din. What then? Old Lady. Repaire to me within this houre. Cler. Where? O. Lady. What's that to you? come you, sir, when y'are sent for. Cler. God a mercy Mumpsimus, You may goe Dinant, and follow this old Fairie, Till you have lost your selfe, your friends, your credit, And hunny out your youth, in rare adventures, I can but grieve, I have knowne you. Old Lady. Will ye goe sir? I come not often to you with these blessings, You may believe that thing there, and repent it, That dogged thing. Cler. Peace touchwood. Din. I will not goe: Goe bid your Lady seeke some foole, to fawne on her Some unexperienc'd puppie, to make sport with, I have bin her mirth too long, thus I shake from me The fetters she put on; thus her enchantments I blow away like wind, no more her beauty. Old Lady. Take heed sir, what you say. Cler. Goe forward Dinant. Din. The charmes shot from her eyes— O. Lady. Be wise. Cler. Be Valiant. Din. That tongue that tells faire tales to mens destructions Shall never rack me more. Old Lady. Stay there. Cler. Goe forward. Din. I will now heare her, see her as a woman, Survey her, and the power man has allowed, sir, As I would due the course of common things, Unmov'd, unstruck. Cler. Hold there, and I forgive thee. Din. She is not faire, and that that makes her proud, Is not her owne, our eies bestow it on her, To touch and kisse her, is no blessednesse, A Sun-burnt Ethiopes lip's as soft as hers. Goe bid her stick some other triumph up, And take into her favour some dull foole, That has no pretious time to loose, no friends, No honour, nor no life, like a bold Merchant, A bold and banquerupt man, I have ventur'd all these, And split my bottome: returne this answer to her, I am awake againe, and see her mischiefes, And am not now, on every idle errand, And now coyn'd anger, to be hurried, And then despis'd againe, I have forgot her. Cler. If this be true— O. Lady. I am sorry, I have troubled you, More sorrie, that my Lady has adventur'd So great a favour, in so weake a mind: This houre you have refus'd, that when you come to know it, Will run you mad, and make you curse that fellow, She is not faire, nor handsome, so I leave you. Cler. Stay Lady, stay, but is there such a businesse? O. Lady. You would breake your neck 'twere yours. Cler. My back, you would say. O. La. But play the friends part still, sir, and undoe him, 'Tis a faire office. Din. I have spoke too liberally. O. Lady. I shall deliver what you say. Cler. You shall be hang'd first, You would faine be prating now; take the man with you. O. Lady. Not I, I have no power. Cler. You may goe Dinant. O. Lady. 'Tis in's own will, I had no further charge, sir, Then to tell him what I did, which if I had thought It should have bin receiv'd so— Cler. 'Faith you may, You doe not know, how far it may concerne you. If I perceiv'd any trick in't. Din. 'Twill end there. Cler. 'Tis my fault then, there is an houre in fortune, That must be still observ'd: you thinke I'll chide you. When things must be nay see, an he will hold his head up? Would such a Lady send with such a charge too? Say she has plaid the foole, play the foole with her againe, The great foole, the greater still the better, He shall goe with you woman. Old Lady. As it please him, I know the way alone else. Din. Where is your Lady? O. Lady. I shall direct you quickly. Din. Well, I'll goe, But what her wrongs, will give me leave to say. Cler. We'll leave that to your selves: I shall heare from you. Din. As soone as I come off— Cler. Come on then bravely; Farewell till then, and play the man. Din. You are merry; All I expect is scorne: Ile lead you Lady. Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Scena prima. Enter Champernell, Lamira, Beaupre, Verdoone, Chailote. Beaup. We'll venture on him. Cham. Out of my dores I charge thee, see me no more. Lam. Your Nephew? Cham. I disclaime him. He has no part in me, nor in my blood, My Brother that kept fortune bound, and left Conquest hereditary to his Issue Could not beget a coward. Verd. I fought, sir, Like a good fellow, and a souldier too, But men are men, and cannot make their fates: Ascribe you to my Father, what you please, I am borne to suffer. Cham. All disgrace: wretch. Lam. Good sir be patient. Cham. Was there no tree, (For to fall by a noble enemies sword, A Coward is unworthy) nor no River, To force thy life out backward, or to drowne it, But that thou must survive thy infamie? And kill me, with the sight of one I hate? And gladly would forget? Beaup. Sir, his misfortune Deserves not this reproofe. Cham. In your opinion, 'Tis fit you two should be of one beliefe, You are indeed, fine gallants, and fight bravely I'th' City with your tongues, but in the field Have neither spirit to dare, nor power to doe, Your swords, are all ledd there. Beaup. I know no duty, (How ever you may wreake your spleene on him) That bindes me to endure this. Cham. From Dinant You'll suffer more; that ever cursed I, Should give my honour up, to the defence Of such a thing as he is, or my Lady That is all Innocent, for whom a dove would Assume the courage of a daring Eagle, Repose her confidence in one that can No better guard her. In contempt of you I love Dinant, mine enemy, nay admire him, His valour claimes it from me, and with justice, He that could fight thus, in a cause not honest, His sword edg'd with defence, of right and honour, Would pierce as deep as lightning, with that speed too, And kill as deadly. Verd. You are as far from Justice, In him you praise, as equitie in the censure, You load me with. Beaup. Dinant? he durst not meet us. Lam. How? durst not brother? Beaup. Durst not, I repeat it; Verdo. Nor was it Cleremont's valour that disarm'd us, I had the better of him; for Dinant, If that might make my peace with you, I dare Write him a Coward, upon every post, And with the hazard of my life defend it. Lam. If 'twere laied at the stake, you'd loose it, Nephew, Cham. Came he not, say you? Verd. No, but in his roome, There was a divell, hir'd from some Magician I'th' shape of an Atturney. Beau. 'Twas he did it. Verd. And his the honour. Beau. I could wish Dinant— But what talke I of one that stept aside, And durst not come? Lam. I am such a friend to truth, I cannot heare this: why doe you detract Thus poorely (I should say to others basely) From one, of such approv'd worth? Cham. Ha! how's this? Lam. From one so excellent, in all that's noble, Whose onely weaknesse, is excesse of courage? That knowes no enemies, that he cannot master, But his affections, and in them, the worst His love to me. Cham. To you? Lam. Yes, sir to me, I dare (for what is that, which Innocence dares not) To you professe it, and he shun'd the Combat For feare, or doubt of these: blush and repent, That you in thought, ere did that wrong to valour. Beau. Why, this is rare. Cham. 'Fore heaven, exceeding rare; Why modest Lady, you that sing such Encomiums Of your first Suiter— Verd. How can ye convince us In our reports? Lam. VVith what you cannot answer, 'Twas my command that staied him. Cham. Your command? Lam. Mine, sir, and had my will rank'd with my power, And his obedience, I could have sent him VVith more ease, weaponlesse to you, and bound, Then have kept him back, so well he loves his honour Beyond his life. Cham. Better, and better still, Lam. I wrought with him in private to divert him From your assur'd destruction, had he met you. Cham. In private? Lam. Yes, and us'd all Arts, all Charmes, Of one that knew her selfe the absolute Mistris Of all his faculties. Cham. Gave all rewards too His service could deserve; did not he take The measure of my sheets? Lam. Doe not looke yellow, I have cause to speake; frownes cannot fright me, By all my hopes, as I am spotlesse to you, If I rest once assur'd, you doe but doubt me, Or curbe me of that freedome, you once gave me— Cham. VVhat then? Lam. I'll not alone, abuse your bed, that's nothing, But to your more vexation, 'tis resov'd on, I'll run away, and then try if Dinant Have courage to defend me. Champ. Impudent! Verdo. And on the sudden— Beau. How are ye transform'd, From what you were? Lam. I was an innocent Virgin, And I can truly sweare, a Wife as pure As ever lay by Husband, and will dy so, Let me live unsuspected, I am no servant, Nor will be us'd like one: If you desire To keep me constant, as I would be, let Trust and beliefe in you, beget, and nurse it; Unnecessary jealousies, make more whores Then all baites els, laied to entrap our frailties. Beau. There's no contesting with her, from a child Once mov'd, she hardly was to be appeas'd, Yet I dare sweare her honest. Cham. So I thinke too, On better judgement: I am no Italian To lock her up; nor would I be a Dutchman, To have my Wife, my soveraigne, to command me: I'll try the gentler way, but if that faile, Believe it, Sir, there's nothing but extreames, VVhich she must feele from me. Beau. That, as you please sir. Charl. You have won the breeches, Madam, looke up sweetly, My Lord limpes toward you. Lam. You will learne more manners. Charl. This is a fee, for counsell that's unask'd for. Cham. Come, I mistook thee sweet, prethee forgive me, I never will be jealous: ere I cherish Such a mechanick humour; I'll be nothing; I'll say Dinant, is all that thou wouldst have him, VVill that suffice? Lam. 'Tis well, sir. Champ. Use thy freedome Uncheck'd, and unobserv'd, if thou wilt have it, These shall forget their honour, I my wrongs We'll all dote on him, hell be my reward If I dissemble. Lam. And that hell take me If I affect him, he's a lustfull villaine, (But yet no coward) and sollicites me To my dishonour, that's indeed a quarrell, And truly mine, which I will so revenge, As it shall fright, such as dare onely thinke To be adulterers. Cham. Use thine owne waies, I give up all to thee. Beau. O women, women! When you are pleas'd you are the least of evils. Verd. I'll rime to't, but provokt, the worst of divells. Exeunt. Enter Monsier Sampson, and three Clients. Samp. I know Monsier La-writ. 1 Cly. VVould he knew himselfe, Sir. Samp. He was a pretty Lawyer, a kind of pretty Lawyer. Of a kind, of unable thing. 2 Cly. A fine Lawyer, Sir, And would have firk'd you up a businesse, And out of this Court into that. Samp. Ye are too forward, Not so fine my friends, something he could have done, But short, short. 1 Cly. I know your worships favour, You are Nephew to the Judge, Sir. Samp. It may be so, And something may be done, without trotting i'th' durt, friends; It may be I can take him in his Chamber, And have an houres talke, it may be so, And tell him that in's eare, there are such courtesies: I will not say, I can. 3 Cly. VVe know you can, sir. Sam. Peradventure I, peradventure no: but where's Lawrit? VVhere's your sufficient Lawyer? 1 Cly. He's blowne up, Sir. 2 Cly. Run mad, and quarrells, with the dog he meets; He is no Lawyer, of this world now. Samp. Your reason? Is he defunct? is he dead? 2 Cly. No, he's not dead yet, sir; But I would be loth to take a lease on's life for two houres: Alas, he is possest sir, with the spirit of fighting, And quarrells with all people; but how he came to it— Samp. If he fight well, and like a Gentleman, The man may fight, for 'tis a lawfull calling. Looke you my friends, I am a civill Gentleman, And my Lord my Uncle loves me. 3 Cly. We all know it, sir. Sam. I thinke he does, sir, I have business too, much businesse, Turn you some forty or fifty Causes in a weeke; Yet when I get an houre of vacancie, I can fight too my friends, a little does well, I would be loth to learne to fight. 1 Cly. But and't please you, sir, His fighting has neglected all our businesse, We are undone, our causes cast away, sir, His not appearance. Sam. There he fought too long A little, &amp; fight well, he fought too long indeed friends; But ne'r the lesse, things must be, as they may, And there be wayes— 1 Cly. We know, sir, if you please— Sam. Something I'll doe; goe rally up your Causes. Enter La-writ, and a Gentleman at the dore. 2 Cly. Now you may behold sir, And be a witnesse, whether we lie or no. La-writ. I'll meet you at the Ordinary, sweet Gentlemen, And if there be a wench or two— Gent. We'll have 'em, La-wr. No handling any Duells before I come, We'll have no going lesse, I hate a coward. Gent. There shall be nothing done. La-wr. Make all the quarrells You can devise before I come, and let's all fight, There is no sport els. Gent. We'll see what may be done, sir, 1 Cly. Ha? Monsier La-writ? La-Wr. Baffled in way of businesse, My causes cast away, Judgement against us? Why there it goes 2 Cli. What shall we do the whilst Sir? La-Wr. Breed new dissentions, goe hang your selves 'Tis all one to me; I have a new trade of living. 1 Cli. Doe you heare what he saies Sir? Sam. The Gentleman, speakes finely La-Wr. Will any of you fight? Fightings my occupation If you find your selves agreev'd; Sam. A compleate Gentleman. La-Wr. Avant thou buckrum budget of petitions, Thou spittle of lame causes; I lament for thee, And till revenge be taken— Sam. 'Tis most excellent. La-Wr. There every man chuse his paper, and his place. I'll answer ye all, I will neglect no mans busines But he shall have satisfaction like a Gentleman, The Judge may doe and not doe, hee's but a Monsieur Sam. You have nothing of mine in your bag, Sir, La-Wr. I know not Sir, But you may put any thing in, any fighting thing Sam. It is sufficient, you may heare hereafter. La-Wr. I rest your servant Sir. Sam. No more words Gentlemen But follow me, no more words as you love me, The Gentlemans, a noble Gentleman. I shall doe what I can, and then— Cli. We thanke you Sir. Exit Sam. and Clients. Sam. Not a word to disturb him, hee's a Gentleman. La-Wr. No cause goe? o my side the judge cast all? And because I was honourably employed in action, And not appear'd, pronounce? 'tis very well, 'Tis well faith, 'tis well, Judge. Enter Cleremont. Cler. Who have we here? My little furious Lawyer? La-Wr. I say 'tis well, But marke the end. Cler. How he is metamorphis'd? Nothing of Lawyer left not a bit of buckrum, No solliciting face now, This is no simple conversion Your servant Sir, and Friend. La-Wr. You come in time, Sir, Cler. The happier man, to be at your command then. La-Wr. You may wonder to see me thus; but that's all one Time shall declare; 'tis true I was a Lawyer, But I have mend that coat, I hate a Lawyer, I talk'd much in the Court, now I hate talking I did you the office of a man. Cler. I must confesse it. La-wr. And budg'd not, no I budg'd not Cler. No, ye did not, La-wr. Ther's it then, one good turne requires another Cler. Most willing Sir, I am ready at your service La-wr. There read and understand, &amp; then deliver it Cler. This is a challenge Sir, La-wr. 'Tis very like Sir, I seldome now write Sonnets Cler. O admirantis, To Monsieur Vertaigne the president, La-wr. I choose no foole sir, Cler. Why hee's no sword man Sir, La-wr. Let him learne, let him learne, Time that traines Chickens up, will teach him quickly Cler. Why hee's a Judge, an old man. La-wr. Never too old. To be a Gentleman; and he that is a judge Can judge best what belongs to wounded honour; There are my griefes he has cast away my causes, In which he has bowed my reputation. And therefore Judge, or no Judge, Cler. Pray be rul'd Sir, This is the maddest thing— La-wr. You will not carry it, Cler. I doe not tell you so, but if you may be perswaded La-wr. You know how you us'd me, when I would not fight, Doe you remember Gentleman? Cler. The Divells in him. La-wr. I see it in your eyes, that you dare it You have a carrying face, and you shall carry it, Cler. The least is banishment La-wr. Be banish'd then; 'Tis a friends part, wee'll meete in Africa, Or any corner of the earth. Cler. Say he will not fight, La-wr. I know then what to say take you no care Sir, Cler. Well, I will carry it, and deliver it, And to morrow morning meere you in the louer, Till when, my service, La-Wr. A Judge, or no Judge, no Judge. Exit La-wr. Cler. This is the prettiest Rogue that 'ere I read of, None to provoke to th'field, but the old president; What face shall I put on? if I come in earnest, I am sure to weare a paire of braceletts; This may make some sport yet, I will deliver it Here comes the president. Enter Vertaigne with two Gentlemen. Vert. I shall find time Gentlemen, To doe your causes good, is not that Cleremont. 1 Gent. 'Tis he my Lord? Vert. Why does he smile upon me? Am I become ridiculous? has your fortune Sir Upon my son made you contemne his Father? The glory of a Gentleman, is faire bearing. Cler. Mistake me not my Lord, you shall not find that; I come with no blowen spirit to abuse you, I know your place, and honour due unto it, The reverence to your silver age and vertue, Vert. Your face is merry still. Cler. So is my businesse, And I beseech your honour, mistake me not I have brought you from a wild, or rather mad man As mad a peice—of you were wont to love mirth, In your young dayes, I have knowne your honour wo it This may be made no little one, 'tis a challenge Sir, Nay start not I beseech you, it meanes you no harme Nor any man of honour, or understanding 'Tis to steale from your serious houres a little laughters I am bold to bring it to your Lordship, Vert. 'Tis to me indeed. Doe they take me for a sword man, at these yeares? Cler. 'Tis onely worth your honours mirth thats all Sir, 'Tad bin in me else a sawcie rudenesse. Vert. From one La-Writ, a very punctuall challenge, Cler. But if your Lordship marke it, no great matter Vert. I have knowne such a wrangling advocate, Such a little figent thiing; Oh I remember him, A notable talking knave, now out upon him, Has challeng'd me downe right, defied me mortally I doe remember too, I cast his causes Cler. Why ther's the quarrell Sir, the mortall quarrell Vert. Why what a knave is this? as y'are? Gentleman Is there no further purpose but meere mirth? What a bold man of warre, he invites me roundly Cler. If there should be, I were no Gentleman. Nor worthy of the honour of my kindred, And though I am sure your Lordship hate my person, Which time may bring againe into your favour, Yet for my manners— Vert. I am satisfied, You see Sir, I have out liv'd those daies of fighting, And therefore cannot do him the honour to beate him myselfe But I have a kinsman, much of his abilitie His wit and carriage, for this calls him foole, One that will spit as senselesse fire, as this fellow Cler. And such a man to undertake, my Lord, Verta. Nay hees too forward, these two pitch barrells together Cler. Upon my soule no harme. Vert. It makes me smile, Why what a stinking smother will they utter? Yes he shall undertake Sir, as my Champion, Since you propound it mirth, i'll venture on it And shall defend my cause, but as y'ar honest Sport not with blood. Cler. Thinke not so basely, good Sir, Vert. A squire shall waite upon you from my kinsman, To morrow morning, make your sport at full, You want no subject, but no wounds. Cler. That's my care Vert. And so good day. Exit Vertaine and Gentlemen. Cler. Many unto your honour, This is a noble fellow of a sweet spirit, Now must I thinke how to contrive this matter, For together they shall goe. Enter Dinant. Din. O Cleremont I am glad I have found thee, Cler. I can tell thee rare things, Din. O I can tell thee rarer, Dost thou love me? Cler. Love thee? Din. Doest thou love me dearely Dar'st thou for my sake? Cler. Any thing that's honest Din. Though it be dangerous Cler. Pox o dangerous Din. Nay wonderous dangerous. Cler. Wilt thou breake my hearte? Din. Along with me then. Cler. I must part to morrow. Din. You shall, you shall, be faithfull for this night And thou hast made thy freind. Cler. Away and talke not Exeunt. Enter Lamira and Nurse. Lam. O Nurse welcome, where's Dinant? Nurse. Hee is at my back 'Tis the most liberall Gentleman, this gold, He gave me for my paines, nor can I blame you, If you yeild up the for't Lam. How? yeild it up? Nurse. I know not, he that loves, and gives so largely, And a young Lord to boote, or I am cousend May enter every where. Lam. Thou't make me angry. Enter Dinant and Cleremont. Nurse. Why if you are I hope heres on will please you, Looke on him with my eyes, good luck goe with you Were I young for your sake.— Din. I thanke thee Nurse, Nurse. I would be tractable, and as I am— Lam. Leave the roome, So old, and so immodest? and be carefull, Since whispers will make sleeping jealousies. That none disturb my Lord. Exit Nurse. Cler. Will you dispatch? Till you come to the matter be not rapt thus, Walk in, walk in, I am your scout for once, You owe me the like service, Din. And will pay it, Lam. As you respect our lives, speake not so loud Cler. Why, to it in dumb shew then, I am silenc'd Lam. Be not so hasty Sir, the golden apples, Had a fell dragon for their guard, your pleasures Are to be attempted with Herculean danger, Or never to be gotten Din. Speake the meanes, Lam. Thus briefely my Lord sleepes now, and alas, Each night he only sleepes. Cler. Goe keepe her stirring, Lam. Now if he wake, as sometimes he does, He only stretches out his hand and feeles, Whether I am a bed, which being assur'd of He sleepes againe; But should he misse me, valour Could not defend our lives, Din. Wha'ts to be done then? Lam. Servants have servile Faiths, nor have I any That I dare trust; on noble Cleremont We safely may rely Cler. What man can doe, Command and boldly, Lam. Thus then in my place, You must lye with my Lord, Cler. With an old man? Two beards together? that's prepostrous. Lam. There is no other way, and though 'tis dangerous He having servants within call; and arm'd too, Slaves feed to act, all that his jealousy, And rage commands them, yet a true friend should not Checke at the hazard of a life, Cler. I thanke you, I love my friend, but know no reason why To hate my self, to be a kind of pander, You see I am willing, But to betray mine owne throat you must pardon, Din. Then I am lost, and all my hopes defeated Were I to hazard ten times more for you, You should find, Cleremont— Cler. You shall not out doe me, Fall what may fall, i'll do't Din. But for his beard— Lam. To cover that you shall have my night Linnen, And you dispos'd of, my Dinant and I, Will have some private conference. Enter Champ. privately. Cler. Private doing, Or i'll not venture, Lam. That's as we agree. Exeunt. Enter Nurse and Charloth, pass 'ore the stage with pillowes night Cloaths and such things. Cham. What can this Woman do, preserving her honour? I have given her all the liberty that may be I will not be far off though; nor I will not be jealous Nor trust too much, I think she is vertuous, Yet when I hold her best, she's but a woman, As full of frailty as of Faith, a poore sleight woman, And her best thoughts, but weake fortifications, There may be a meane wrought. Well, let 'em work then, I shall meet with it: till the signes be monstrous, And stick upon my head, I will not believe it, Stands private. She may be &amp; she may not: now to my observation. Enter Dinant, and Lamira. Din. VVhy do you make me stay so? if you love me— Lam. You are too hot, and violent. Din. Why doe you shift thus From one chamber to another? Lam. A little delay, sir, Like fire, a little sprinckled ore with water, Makes the desires burne cleare, and ten times hotter. Din. Why doe you speake so lowd? I pray'e goe in Sweet Mistris I am mad, time steales away, And when we would enjoy— Lam. Now fy, fy servant, Wine. Like sensuall beasts, shall we enjoy our pleasures? Din. Pray doe but kisse me then. Lam. Why, that I will, and you shall find anon, servant. Di. Softly for heavens sake, you know my friend's engag'd, A little now, now; Will you goe in againe? Lam. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Din. Why doe you laugh so lowd? pretious, Will you betray me? ha my friends throat cut? Lam. Come, come, I'le kisse thee again. Cham. Will you so? you are liberall, If you doe cozen me— Enter Nurse with Wine. Din. What's this? Lam. Wine, wine, a draught or two. Din. What does this woman here? Lam. She shall not hinder you. Din. This might have bin spar'd, 'Tis but delay, and time lost: pray send her softly off. Lam. Sit downe, and mix your spirits with VVine, I will make you another Hercules. Din. I dare not drinke; Fy, what delayes you make? I dare not, Recorders. I shall be drunke presently and do strange things then. Lam. Not drink a cup with your Mistris? ô the pleasure. Din. Lady, why this? Musicke. Lam. We must have mirth to our wine, man. Din. Pl? o'th' Musick. Cham. God-a-mercy VVench, If thou dost Cuckold me, I shall forgive thee. Din. The house will all rise now, this will disturb all. Did you doe this? Lam. Peace, and sit quiet, foole, You love me, come, sit downe and drinke. Enter Cleremont above. Cler, VVhat a divell aile you? How cold I sweat? a hogs pox, stop your pipes, Musick, The thing will wake: now, now me thinks I find His Sword just gliding through my throte: VVhat's that? A vengeance choke your pipes. Are you there Lady? Stop, stop those rascalls; doe you bring me hither To be cut into minced meate? VVhy Dinant? Din. I cannot doe withall; I have spoke, and spoke: I am betraied, and lost too. Cler. Doe you heare me? do you understand me? Plague dam your whistles. Musicke ends. Lam. 'Twas but an over-sight, they have done, ly down. Cler. VVould you had done too. You know not In what a misery, and feare I ly. You have a Lady in your armes. Din. I would have— The Recorders againe. Cham. I'le watch you goodman wood have. Cler. Remove for heavens sake, And fall to that you come for. Lam. Ly you downe, 'Tis but an houres endurance now. Cler. I dare not, softly sweet Lady,—heart? Lam. 'Tis nothing but your feare, he sleeps still soundly, Ly gently downe. Cler. 'Pray make an end. Din. Come, Madam. Lam. These Chambers are too neare. Ex. Din. Lam. Cham. I shall be nearer; Well, goe thy wayes. I'le trust thee through the world, Deale how thou wilt: that that I never feele, I'le never feare. Yet by the honour of a Souldiour, I hold thee truly Noble. How these things will looke, And how their bloods will curdle? play on children, You shall have pap anon. O thou grand foole, That thou knowest, but thy fortune— Musick done. Cler. Peace, good Madam, Stop her mouth Dinant, it sleeps yet, 'pray' be wary, Dispatch, I cannot endure this misery, I can heare nothing more; I'le say my praiers, And downe againe— Whistle within. A thousand larums, fall upon my quarter Heaven send me off; When I ly keeping courses. Pl? o' your fumbling Dinant; how I shake? 'Tis still againe. Would I were in the Indies. Exit Cler. Enter Dinant, and Lamira. A light within. Din. Why doe ye use me thus? thus poorely? basely? Worke me into a hope, and then destroy me? Why did you send for me? this new way traine me? Lam. Madman, a fool, &amp; fals man, now Ile shew thee man Din. 'Pray' put your light out. Lam. No I'le hold it thus, That all chast eyes, may see thy lust, and scorne it, Tell me but this, when you first doted on me, And made suite to enjoy me, as your wife, Did you not hold me honest? Din. Yes, most vertuous. Lam. And did not that appeare, the onely lustre That made me worth your love, and admiration? Din. I must confesse— Lam. Why would you deale so basely? So like a thiefe? a villaine? Din. Peace, good Madam. Lam. I'le speake aloud too; thus maliciously, Thus breaking all the rules of honestie, Of honour, and of truth, for which I lov'd you, For which, I call'd you servant, and admir'd you, To steale that jewell, purchas'd by another Piously set in Wedlock, even that Jewell, Because it had no flame, you held unvaluable: Can he that has lov'd good, doat on the divell? For he that seekes a whore, seeks but his agent: Or am I of so wild, and low of blood, So nurs'd in infamies? Din. I doe not thinke so, And I repent. Lam. That will not serve your turne, sir. Din. It was your treaty drew me on. Lam. But it was your villany, Made you pursue it: I drew you but to try How much a man, and nobly you durst stand, How well you had deserv'd the name of vertuous; But you, like a wild torrent, mix'd with all Beastly and base affections came floating on, Swelling your poison'd billowes— Din. Will you betray me? Lam. To all the miseries, a vext woman may. Din. Let me but out, Give me but roome to tosse my sword about me, And I will tell you y'are a treacherous woman, O that I had but words! Lam. They will not serve you. Din. But two-edg'd words to cut thee; a Lady traytor? Perish by a proud puppet? I did you too much honour, To tender you my love, too much respected you, To thinke you worthy of my worst embraces. Goe, take your groome, and let him dally with you, Your greasie groome; I scorne to impe your lame stock, You are not faire, nor handsome, I lyed loudly. This tongue abus'd you, when it spoke you beauteous. Lam. 'Tis very well, 'tis brave. Din. Put out your light, Your lascivious eyes, are flames enough For fooles to find you out: a Lady plotter? Must I begin, your sacrifice of mischiefe? I and my friend, the first fruits of that blood, You and your honourable Husband aime at? Crooked and wretched you are both. Lam. To you, sir, Yet to the eye of Justice, streight as Truth. Din. Is this a womans love? a womans mercy? Do you professe this seriously? doe you laugh at me? Lam. Ha, ha. Din. Pl? light upon your scornes, upon your flatteries Upon your tempting faces, all destructions: A bedrid Winter hang upon your cheekes, And blast, blast, blast, those buds of pride that point you; Death in your eyes to fright men from these dangers. Raise up your trophy Cleremont. Cler. What a vengeance ayle yon? Din. What dismall noise is there, no honour in you? Cleremont, we are betraied, betraied, sold by a woman, Deale bravely for thy selfe. Cler. This comes of rutting; Are we made stales to one another? Din. Yes, we are undone, lost. Cler. You shall pay for't grey-beard: Vp up, you sleep your last else. Lights above, two Servants and Anabell. 1 Serv. No not yet, sir, Lady, looke up: would you have wrong'd this beauty? Wake so tender a Virgin, with rough tearmes? You weare a sword; we must entreat you leave it. 2 Serv. Fy sir, so sweet a Lady? Cle. Was this my bed-fellow? pray give me leave to look, I am not mad yet, I may be, by and by. Did this ly by me? Did I feare this? is this a cause to shake at? Away with me for shame, I am a rascall. Enter Champernell, Beaupre, Verdoone, Laimra, Anabel, Cleremont, and two Servants. Din. I am amaz'd too. Beau. We'll recover you. Verd. You walk like Robin-good-fellow, all the house over And every man afraid of you. Din. 'Tis well Lady. The honour of this deed, will be your owne, The world shall know your bounty. Beaup. What shall we doe with 'em? Cler. Geld me, For 'tis not fit I should be a man againe, I am an Asse, a Dog. Lam. Take your revenges, You know my Husbands wrongs, and your owne losses. Anab. A brave man, an admirable brave man; Well, well, I would not be so tried again; A very handsome proper gentleman. Cler. Will you let me ly by her but one houre more, And then hang me? Din. Wee wait your malice, put your swords home bravely, You have reason to seeke blood. Lam. Not as you are Noble. Cham. Hands off and give them liberty, onely disarm 'em. Beaup. We have done that already. Champ. You are welcome gentlemen, I am glad my house, has any pleasure for you, I keep a couple of Ladies here, they say faire, And you are young, and handsome gentlemen; Have you anymore mind to Wenches? Cler. To be abus'd too? Lady, you might have help'd this, Ana. Sir now 'tis past, but 't may be I may stand, Your friend hereafter, in a greater matter. Cler. Never whilst you live. Ana. You cannot tell—now sir a parting hand. Cler. Downe and Roses: Well I may live to see you again. A dull rogue, No revelation in thee. Lam. Were you well frighted? Were your fitts, from the heart, of all colds and colours? That's all your punishment. Cler. It might have bin all yours, Had not a blockhead undertaken it. Cham. Your swords you must leave to these gentlemen. Verd. And now, when you dare fight, We are on even Ice againe. Din. 'Tis well: To be a Mistris, is to be a monster. And so I leave your house, and you for ever. Lam. Leave your wild lusts, and then you are a master. Cham. You may depart too. Cler. I had rather stay here. Cham. Faith we shall fright you worse. Cler. Not in that manner, There's five hundred crownes, fright me but so againe. Din. Come Cleremont, this is the houre of foole. Cler. Wiser the next shall be or we'll to schoole. Exeunt. Champ. How coolely these hot gallants are departed? Faith cousin 'twas unconscionably done, To ly so still and so long. Anab. 'Twas your pleasure, If 'twere a fault I may hereafter mend. Champ. O, My best Wife. Take now what course thou wilt, and lead what life. Lam. The more trust you commit, the more care still, Goodnesse and vertue, shall attend my will. Cham. Let's laugh this night out now &amp; countour gains, We have our honours home, and they their paines. Exeunt omnes.</field>

Ana. In me their power suffers, That should protect the Innocent, 1 Gent. I am all fire, And thou shall quench it, and serve my pleasures, Come partner in the spoile and the reward, Let us enjoy our purchase Lam. O Dinant! O Heaven! o Husband! Ana. O my Cleremont! 1 Gent. Two are our slaves they call on, bring 'em forth As they are chaind together let them see And suffer in the object. Enter Dinant and Cleremont bound. By the rest of the Gent. 2 Gen. While we sit And without pitty heare 'em Cler. By my life, I suffer more for thee then for my self, Din. Be a man Cleremont, and looke upon 'em, As such that not alone abus'd our service, Fed us with hopes most bitter indigestion, But when love faild, to draw on further mischief, The baites they laied for us; were our owne honours, Which thus hath made us slaves too, worse then slaves 2 Gen. He dies 1 Gen. Pray hold, give him a little respite, Din. I see you now beyond expression wretched, The wit you bragd of, foold, that boasted honour, As you beleev'd compass'd with walls of brasse, To guard it sure, Subject to be o're throwne With the least blast of lust. Lam. A most sad truth. Din. That confidence which was not to be shaken In a perpetuall fever, and those favours, Which with so strong, and Ceremonious duty Your lover and a Gentleman long sought for, Sought, sued, and kneeld in vaine for, must you yeild up To a licentious villaine, that will hardly, Allow you thanks for't Cler. Something I must say too, And to you pretty one, though crying one; To be hangd now, when these worshipful benchers please Though I know not their faces that condemne me, A little startles me, but a man is nothing, A Maydenhead is the thing, the thing all aime at; Doe not you wish now, and wish from your heart too, When scarce sweet with my feares, I long lay by you Those feares you and your good Aunt put upon me, To make you sport you had giuen a little hint, A touch or so, to tell me I was mortall, And by a mortall woman? Ana. Pray you no more Cler. If I had loos'd that virgin Zone, observe me, I would have hired the best of all our Poets To have sung so much, and so well in the honour Of that nights joye, that Ovids afternoone, Nor his Corvina should againe be mentioned, Ana. I doe repent, and wish I had, Cler. That's comfort, But now.— 2 Gent. Another that will have it offer'd, Compell it to be offer'd, shall enjoye it. Cler. A rogue, a ruffian. 2 Gen. As you love your throat,— 1 Gen. Away with them. Ana. O Cleremont! Lam. O Dinant! Din. I can but add your sorrowes to my sorrowes, Your feares to my feares. Cler. To your wishes mine. This slave may prove unable to performe, Till I performe the taske that I was borne for, Ana. Amen, amen. 1 Gent. Drag the slaves hence, for you A while i'll locke you up here study all wayes You can to please me, or the deed being done, You are but dead. 2 Gen. This strong vault shall conteine you There thinke how many for your maydenhead Have pin'd away, and be prepared to loose it With penitence. 1 Gent. No humane help can save you. Ladyes. Helpe, helpe? 2 Gent. You cry in vaine, rockes cannot heare you.</field>

O Cousen how I shake, all this long night. What frights and noises we have heard still they encrease The villaines put on shapes to torture us, And to their Divells forme such preparations As if they were a hatching new dishonours, And fatall ruine, past dull mans invention Goe not too far and pray good Cousen Anabell Harke a new noise. A strange Musick. Ana. They are exquisite in mischeif. Sackbut &amp; Troup musick. I will goe on this roome gives no protection, More then the next, what's that? how sad and hollow, The sound comes to us. Theeves peeping. Lam. Groning? or singing is it? Lowder. Ana. The wind I think murmuring amongst old rooms Lam. Now it growes lowder sure some sad presage Of our fowle losse—peepe—, looke now they peepe, Ana. Pox peepe 'em. Lam. O give them gentle language, Ana. Give em rats-bane. Peepe above. Lam. Now they are above Ana. I would they were i'th Center, Lam. Thou art so foolish desperate, Ana. Since we must loose. Lam. Call 'em brave fellowes, Gentlemen, Ana. Call 'em rogues, Rogues as they are, rude rogues, uncivill villaines Lam. Look an thou woot, beware dost thou feele the danger? Ana. Till the danger feele me, this will I talke still, And worse when that comes too; they cannot eate me This is a punishment upon our owne prides, Most justly laied; we must abuse brave Gentlemen, Make 'em tame fooles &amp; hobby-horses, laugh &amp; jeere at Such men too, and so handsome and so Noble, That howsoere we seem'd to carry it Woo'd 'twer to doe againe, Lam. I doe confesse cousen, It was too harsh, too foolish. Ana. Doe you feele it? Doe you find it now? take heed ot'h punishment, We might have had two gallant Gentlemen, Proper young, o how it tortures me Two Divells now, two rascalls two and twenty Lam. O thinke not so Ana. Nay an we scape so modestly— Lam. May we be worthy any eyes, or knowledge, When we are used thus? Ana. Why not? why doe you cry! Are we not women still? what were we made for? Lam. But thus, thus basely— Ana. 'Tis against our wills, And if there come a thousand so,— Lam. Out on thee, Ana. You are a foole, what we cannot resist, Why should we greive and blush for? there be women, And they that beare the name of excellent women Would give their whole estates, to meete this fortune Lam. Harke, a new noise. New sound within. Ana. Let 'em goe on, I feare not, If wrangling fighting and scratching cannot preserve me Why so be it Cousen; if I be ordain'd To breed a race of rogues.— Enter foure over the stage with Beaupre and Verdoone bound and halters about their necks. Lam. They come Ana. Be firme, They are wellcom. Lam. What mask of death is this? O my deare Brother Ana. My coose to; why now y'are glorious villaines Lam. O, shall we loose our honours? Ana. Let 'em goe, When death prepares the way, they are but Pageants Why must these dye? Beau. Lament your owne misfortunes We perish happily before your ruines, Ana. Has mischeif ne'r a tongue? 1 Gent. Yes foolish woman, Our Captaines will is death. Ana. You dare not doe it Tell thy base boisterous Captaine what I say, Thy lawlesse Captaine that he dares not; Doe you laugh you rogue? you pamperd rogue? Lam. Good Sir, Good Cousen gently, as y'are a Gentleman,— Ana. A gentleman? a slave a dog the devills harbinger Lam. Sir as you had a mother, Ana. He a Mother? Shame not the name of mother, a she Beare A bloody old woolf bitch, a woman Mother? Lookes that rude lumpe, as if he had a mother? Intreat him? hang him do thy worst thou darst not, Thou dar'st not wrong their lives, thy Captain dares not They are persons of more price Ver. What ere we suffer Let not your angers wrong you, Ana. You cannot suffer. The men that doe this deed must live i'th moone Free from the gripe of Justice. Lam. Is it not better? Ann. Is it not better? let 'em goe on like rascalls And put false faces on; they dare not doe it; Flatter such scabbs of nature, Gent. Woman, woman The next worke is with you. Ana. Unbind those Gentlemen, And put their fatall fortunes, on our neckes. Lam. As you have mercy doe; Ana. As you are monsters. Lam. Fright us no more with shipwrack of our honours Nor if there be a guilt by us committed Let it endanger those, Ana. I say they dare not. There be a thousand gallouses yee rogues, Tortures, ye bloody rogues wheeles, Gent. Away. Lam. Stay. Ana.

Stay yet The Devill and his lovely dam walke with you, Come fortify your self, if they doe dy, Which all their ruggednesse, cannot rack into me They cannot find an houre more Innocent, Nor more friends to revenge 'em. Enter Cleremont disguis'd. Lam. Now stand constant, For now our tryalls come, Cler. This beauties mine Your minute moves not yet, Lam. She sinkes if Christian, If any sparke of noble heate.— Cler. Rise Lady And fearelesse rise, there's no dishonour meant you, Doe you know my tongue? Ana. I have heard it, Cler. Marke it better I am one that loves you, fairely, nobly loves you Looke on my face? Ana. O Sir? Cler. No more words, softly Hearke, but hearke wisely how, understand well, Suspect not, feare not Ana. You have brought me comfort Cler. If you thinke me worthy of your Husband, I am no rogue, nor Begger if you dare doe thus— Ana. You are Mounsier Cleremont, Cler. I am the same If you dare venture, speake, if not I leave you, And leave you to the mercy of these villaines That will not wooe ye much, Ana. Save my reputation And free me from these slaves. Cler. By this kisse i'll doe it And from the least dishonour they dare aime at you I have a priest too, shall be ready. Ana. You are forward, Lam.

Lam. Well, go thy wayes, &amp; thine own shame dwell with thee? Is this the constancy she shewed the bravery The deare love and the life, she owed her kinsmen? O brave tongue valiant glorious woman? Is this the noble anger you arriv'd at? Are these the theeves you scornd the rogues you rayld at? The scabs and scums of nature? o faire modesty, Excellent vertue, whither art thou fled? What hand o heaven is over us, when strong virgins Yeild to their feares, and to their feares their fortunes? Never beleef come neare me more, farewell wench, A long farewell from all that ever knew thee My turne is next, I am resolved it comes But in a nobler shape, ha? Enter Dinant. Din. Blesse yee Lady Lam. Indeed Sir, I had need of many blessings, For all the houres, I have had since I came here, Have bin so many curses. How got you liberty? For I presume you come to comfort me Din. To comfort you, and love you, 'tis most true, My bondage was as yours, as full of bitternesse And every hower my death. Lam. Heaven was your comfort. Din. Till the last evening, sitting full of sadnesse Wailing, sweet Mistris, your unhappy fortunes Mine owne I had the least care of round about me, The Captaine, and the company stood gaping, When I began the story of my love, To you faire Saint, and with so full a sorrow, Followed each point, that even from those rude eyes, That never knew what pitty meant or mercy Ther stole downe soft relentings, take heed Mistris, And let not such unholy hearts out doe you, The soft plum'd god will see againe thus taken, As men transform'd with the strange tale I told They stood amaz'd then bid me rise and live, Take liberty and meanes to see your person, And wisht me prosperous in your love, wish you so, Be wise and loving Lady, shew but you so Lam. O Sir, are these fit houres, to talke of love in? Shall we make fooles of our afflictions? Can any thing sound sweetly in mine eares, Where all the noise of bloody horrour? My Brother, and my Cousen, they are dead Sir, Dead, basely dead, is this an age to foole in? And I my self, I know not what I shall be Yet I must thanke you and if happily You had asked me yesterday, when these were living, And my feares lesse, I might have hearkned to you, Din. Peace to your grief, I bind you to your word. Enter Cleremont Anabell, Beaupre, Verdoone, Charlote Nurse, the two Gentlemen. Lam. How? doe you conjure? Din. Not to raise dreadfull apparitions, Madam, But such as you would gladly see. Lam. My Brother, and nephew living? Beap. And both owe their lives, To the favour of these Gentlemen, Verd. Who deserve Our service, and for us, your gracious thankes. Lam. Which I give freely, and become a suitour, To be hereafter more familiar. Kisse. With such great worth and vertue, 1 Gen. Ever thinke us, Your servants Madam. Cler. Why if thou wilt needs know How we are freed, I will discover it, And with laconick brevity, these Gentlemen This night incountring with those out lawes that Yesterday made us prisoners, and as we were Attempted by 'em they with greater courage, (I am sure with better fortune not alone, Guarded themselves, but forc'd the bloody thieves, Being got betweene them, and this hellish Cave, For safety of their lives, to fly up higher Into the woods, all left to their possession This save your Brother, and your nephew from The gibbet, this redeem'd me from my Chaines, And gave my friend his liberty this preserv'd Your honour ready to be lost, Din. But that I know this for a ly, and that the thieves And gentlemen, are the same men, by my practise, Suborn'd to this he does deliver it With such a constant brow, that I am doubtfull, I should believe him too. 1 Gent. If we did well, We are rewarded. 2 Gent. Thankes but takes away From what was freely purpos'd. Cler. Now by this hand, You have so cunningly discharg'd your parts, That while we live, rest confident you shall Command Dinant and Cleremont, nor Beaupre, Nor Verdoone sents it: for the Ladyes, they Were easie to be gul'd. 1 Gent. 'Twas but a jest, And yet the jest, may chance to breake our neckes Should it be knowne. Cler. Feare nothing. Din. Cleremont. Say, what successe? Cler. As thou wouldst wish, 'tis done Lad, The grove will witnesse with me, that this night, I lay not like a blocke: but how speed you? Din. I yet am in suspence, devise some meanes To get these off, and speedily. Cler. I have it, Come, we are dull, I thinke that the good fellowes, Our predecessors in this place, were not So foolish, and improvident husbands, but 'Twill yeild us meat, and wine. 1 Gent. Let's ransack it, 'Tis ours now, by the Law. Cler. How say you sweet one, Have you an appetite? Ana. To walke againe I'th' Woods, if you thinke fit, rather then eate. Cler. A little respite prithee; nay blush not, You aske but whats your owne, and warrantable Monsier, Beaupre, Verdoone, What thinke you of the motion? Verd. Lead the way. Ex. Beau. We follow willingly. Manent, Din. and Lamira. Cler. When you shall thinke fit, We will expect you. Din. Now be mistris of Your promise Lady. Lam. 'Twas to give you hearing. Din. But that word hearing, did include a grant, And you must make it good. Lam. Must? Din. Must, and shall, I will be fool'd no more, you had your tricks; Made properties, of me, and of my friend; Presum'd upon your power, and whip'd me with The rod of mine owne dotage: doe not flatter Your selfe, with hope, that any humane helpe Can free you, and for ayde by miracle; A base unthankfull woman is unworthy. Lam. You will not force me? Rather then enjury you With your consent because I will torment you; I'le make you feele the effects of abus'd love, And glory in your torture. Lam. Brother, Nephew, Helpe, helpe, for heavens sake. Din. Teare your throat, cry lowder, Though every leafe, these trees beare, were an Eccho, And summond in your best friends to redeeme you, It should be fruitlesse: 'tis not that I love you, Or value those delights you prize so high, That I'le enjoy you, a French crowne will buy More sport, and a companion, to whom, You in your best trim, are an Ethiope. Lam. Forbeare me then. Din. Not so, I'll do't in spite, And breake that stubborne disobedient will, That hath so long held out, that boasted honour, I will make equall with a common VVhores; The spring of Chastity, that fed your pride, And grew into a River of vaine glory, I will defile with mudd, the mudd of lust, And make it lothsome even to goats. Lam. O heaven! No pitty sir? Din. You taught me to be cruell, And dare you thinke of mercy? I'le tell thee foole, Those that surpriz'd thee, were my instruments, I can plot too, good Madam, you shall find it: And in the stead of licking of my fingers, Kneeling, and whining like a boy new breech'd, To get a toy forsooth, not worth an apple, Thus make my way, and with Authority, Command what I would have. Lam. I am lost for ever: Good sir, I doe confesse my fault, my grosse fault, And yeild my selfe up, miserable guilty; Thus kneeling, I confesse, you cannot study Sufficient punishments, to load me with; I am in your power, and I confesse againe, You cannot be too cruell: if there be, Besides the losse of my long guarded honour, Any thing else to make the ballance even: Pray put it in, all hopes, all helpes have left me; I am girt round with sorrow, hell's about me, And ravishment, the least that I can looke for, Doe what you please. Din. Indeed I will doe nothing, Nor touch, nor hurt you Lady, nor had ever Such a lewd purpose. Lam. Can there be such goodnesse, And in a man so injur'd? Din. Be confirmed in't. I seale it thus: I must confesse you vex'd me, In fooling me so often, and those feares, You threw upon me, call'd for a requitall, Which now I have return'd, all unchast love Dinant thus throwes away; live to man-kind, As you have done to me, and I will honour Your vertue, and no more thinke of your beauty. Lam. All I possesse, comes short of satisfaction. Din. No complements: the terrours of this night Imagine, but a fearfull dreame, and so With ease forget it: for Dinant, that labour'd To blast your honour, is a Champion for it, And will protect and guard it. Lam. 'Tis as safe then, As if a compleat Army undertooke it. Exeunt. Enter La-writ, Sampson, Clyents. La-writ. Do not perswade me gentle Monsier Sampson, I am a mortall man againe, a Lawyer, My mortall part, I have put off. Sam. Sweet Monsier, Let but our honours teach us. La-writ. Monsier Sampson, My honourable friend, my valiant friend, Be but so beaten-forward my brave Clyents, I am yours, and you are mine againe, be but so thrasht, Receive that Castigation with a cudgell. Sam. Which calls upon us for a Reparation. La-wr. I have, it cost me halfe a crowne, I beare it All over me, I beare it Monsier Sampson; The oyles, and the old woman, that repaires to me, To noint my beaten body. Sam. It concernes you, You have bin swing'd. La-writ. Let it concerne thee too; Goe and be beaten, speake scurvy words, as I did, Speake to that Lion Lord, waken his anger, And have a hundred Bastinado's, doe; Three broken pates, thy teeth knockt out, doe Sampson, Thy valiant armes and leggs beaten to Poultesses, Doe silly Sampson, doe. 1 Cly. You wrong the gentleman, To put him out of his right minde thus: You wrong us, and our Causes. La-writ. Downe with him gentlemen, Turne him, and beat him, if he breake our peace, Then when thou hast bin Lam'd, thy small guts perisht, Then talke to me, before I scorne thy counsell, Feele what I feele, and let my Lord repaire thee. Sam. And can the brave La-writ— 2 Cly. Tempt him no further, Be warn'd and say no more. La-writ. If thou doest, Sampson, Thou seest my Mirmidons, I'le let 'em loose, That in a moment— Sam. I say nothing, sir, but I could wish— La-wr. They shall destroy thee wishing; There's ne'r a man of these, but have lost ten Causes, Dearer then ten mens lives; tempt, and thou diest: Goe home, and smile upon my Lord, mine Uncle, Take Money of the men thou meanest to Cozen, Drinke Wine, and eat good meat, and live discreetly, Talke little, 'tis an Antidote against a beating; Keep thy hand from thy sword, and from thy Laundresse placket, And thou wilt live long. 1 Cly. Give eare, and be instructed. La-writ. I find I am wiser then a Justice of Peace now, Give me the wisdome that's beaten into a man That sticks still by him: art thou a new man? Sam. Yes, yes, Thy learned precepts have inchanted me, La-writ. Goe my son Sampson, I have now begot thee, I'le send thee causes; speake to thy Lord, and live. And lay my share by, goe and live in peace, Put on new suites, and shew fit for thy place; That man neglects his living, is an Asse: Exit. Samp. Farewell; come chearly boyes, about our businesse, Now welcome tongue againe, hang Swords. 1 Cly. Sweet Advocate. Exeunt. Enter Nurse and Charlote. Nur. I know not wench, they may call 'em what they wil, Outlawes, or theeves, but I am sure to me One was an honest man, he us'd me well, What I did, 'tis no matter, he complain'd not. Char. I must confesse, there was one bold with me too, Some coy thing, would say rude, but 'tis no matter, I was to pay a Waiting womans ransome, And I have don't, and I would pay't againe, Were I taine to morrow Nur. Alas, there was no hurt, If't be a sin, for such as live at hard meat, And keepe a long Lent, in the woods as they doe, To tast a little flesh, Char. God help the Courtiers, That ly at racke and manger Nurse. I shall love A theefe the better for this while I live, They are men of a charitable vocation, And give where there is need, and with discretion, And put a good speed penny in my purse, That has bin empty twenty yeares, Char. Peace Nurse, Farewell, and cry not rost meate, me thinkes Cleremont And my Lady Anabell are in one night, Familliarly acquainted. Nurse. I observe it, If she have got a penny too. Enter Vertaigne Champernell and Provost. Charl. No more, My Lord Mounsier Vertaigne the provost too, Hast and acquaint my Lady. Exit Nurse and Charl. Pro. Wonderous strainge, Vert. 'Tis true Sir, on my credit, Cham. On mine honour, Pro. I have bin provost-Marshall twenty yeares, And have trussed up a thousand of these rascalls, But so nere Paris yet, I never met with, One of that Brotherhood. Cham. We to our cost have, But will you search the wood Pro. It is beset, They cannot scape us, Nothing makes me wonder, So much as having you within their power They let you goe; it was a Courtesy, That French theeves use not often, I much pitty The Gentle Ladyes, yet I know not how, I rather hope then feare Enter Dinant, Cleremont, Verdoone, Beaupre, Lamira, Anabell, Charlote, Nurse. Are these the prisoners? Din. We were such Verta. Kill me not, excesse of joy, Cham. I see thou livest, but hast thou had no fowle play Lam. No on my soule, my usage hath bin noble, Far from all violence, Cham. How were you freed, But kisse me first, wee'll talk of that at leasure, I am glad I have thee; Neice how you keepe off, As you knew me not? Ana. Sir, I am where I owe most duty Cler. 'Tis indeed most true Sir, The man that should have bin your bed fellow Your Lordships Bedfellow, that could not smell out A Virgin of sixteene, that was your foole, To make you merry, this poore simple fellow Has met the maid agen, and now she knowes, He is a man, Cham. How! is she dishonoured? Cler. Not unlesse marriage be dishonourable, Heaven is a witnesse of our happy contract And the next Priest we meete shall warrant it To all the world: I lay with her in jeast, 'Tis turn'd to earnest now. Cham. Is this true Neice Din. Her blushing silence grants it; nay Sir storme not He is my friend, and I can make this good, His birth and fortunes equall hers, your Lordship Might have sought out a worse we are all friends too, All differences end thus. Now Sir, unlesse You would raise new dissentions make perfect What is so well begun Verta. That were not manly, Lam. Let me perswade you. Cham. Well God give you joy, She shall not come a Begger to you Sir, For you Monsieur Dinant 'ere long i'll shew you, Another Neice, to this not much inferiour, As you shall like proceed Din. I thanke you Sir, Cham. Backe then to Paris, well that travell ends That makes of deadly enemies perfect friends. Exeunt omnes.</field>
