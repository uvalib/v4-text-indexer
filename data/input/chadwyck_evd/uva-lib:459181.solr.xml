      <field name="fulltext">Prologue Spectators, take youe noe seuere accounte Of our twoo pilgrims to Parnassus mount. Yf youle take three daies studie in good cheare, Our muse is blest that euer shee came here; If not, wele eare noe more the barren sande, But let our pen seeke a more fertile lande.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I Enter Consiliodorus with Philomusus and Studioso. Consiliodorus Now Philomusus doe youre beardless years, Youre faire yonge springe time, and youre budded youth Vrge mee to aduise youre younge vntutord thoughtes, And giue gray bearded counsell to youre age. Vnto an ould mans speache one minute giue, Who manie yeare haue schooled how to liue; To an aduisinge tounge one halfe houre tende: Whatsoere I speake experience hath pend. Perhaps this tounge, this mindes interpretor, Shall neuer more borowe youre lisninge eare; Eare youe returne from greene Parnassus hill My corps shall lie within some senceless vrne, Some litel graue my ashes shall inclose. My winged soule gins scorne this slimie iayle And thinke vpon a purer mansion. Elde su?ons mee to appeare at Plutos courte Amonge the shadie troups of aerie ghostes. Ile therfore counsell youe while I haue time, For feare youre faire youth wither in her prime. Take good aduise from him that lous youe well, Plaine dealing needes not Retoricks tinklinge bell. Philomusus Father, what ere youre louinge tounge shall vtter, Ile drincke youre wordes with an attentiue eare: Age in his speach a maiestie doth beare. Studioso I loue to heare loue play the oratoure. Younge mens aduise can beare but litell swaye, Counsell coms kindlie from a heade thats graye. Consiliodorus What wisdome manie winters hath begott Tymes midwifrey at length shall bringe to light. Youe twoo are Pilgrims to Parnassus hill Where with sweet Nectar you youre vaines may fill, Wheare youe maye bath youre drye and withered quills And teache them write some sweeter poetrie That may heareafter liue a longer daye. There may youe bath youre lipps in Helicon And wash youre tounge in Aganippes well And teache them warble out some sweet sonnetes To rauishe all the fildes and neighboure groues, That aged Collin, leaninge on his staffe, Feedinge his milkie flocke vppon the downs, May wonder at youre sweete melodious pipe And be attentiue to youre harmonie. There may youre templs be adornd with bays, There may youe slumber in sweet extasies, There may youe sit in softe greene lauriate shade And heare the muses warble out a laye, And, mountinge, singe like larke in so?ers daye. There may youe scorne each Mydas of this age, Eache earthlie peasant and each drossie clowne That knoweth not howe to weighe youre worthiness, But feedeth on beste corne, like a stall fedd ass Whose statelie mouth in scorne by wheate doth pass. I doe co?ende youre studious intent In that youe make soe faire a pilgrimage. If I were younge, who nowe am waxen oulde, Whose yontes youe see are dryde, benumd, and coulde, Though I foreknewe that gold runns to the boore, Ile be a scholler though I liue but poore. If youe will haue a ioyfull pilgrimage Youe muste be warie pilgrims in the waye. Youe muste not truste eache glozinge flatteringe vaine, Ofte when the sunn shins bright it straight will raine. Consorte not in the waye with graceless boys That feede the tauerne with theire idle coyne Till there leane purses starue at last for foode. O why shoulde schollers by vnthriftiness Seeke to weaken theire owne poore estate? Let schollers be as thriftie as they maye, They will be poore ere theire last dyinge daye. Learninge and pouertie will euer kiss: Each carter caries fortune by his side, But fortune will with schollers nere abide. Eschewe all lozell, lazie, loiteringe gromes, All foggie sleepers, and all idle lumps That doe burne out theire base inglorious days Without or frute or ioye of theire loste time. Let lazie grill snorte till the midst of the day, Be you industrious pilgrims in the way. There is another sorte of smooth faced youthes, Those Amorettoes that doe spend theire time In co?inge of their smother dangled heyre. The[y] court a lookinge glass from morne till nighte. Theise woulde entise youe to some curtezan And tell youe tales of itchinge venerie; But let not theire entisementes cause youre falls, Esteeme them as faire rotten painted walls. Nor will I haue youe truste each rugged browe, Each simple seeminge mate, eache hearie chin: Crafte ofte in suche plaine cottages doth in. Associate youre selus with studious youthes That, as Catullus saith, deuours the waye Leades to Parnassus where content doth dwell. Happie I wishe may be youre Pilgrimage, Ioyfull may youe returne from that faire hill And make the vallies heare with admiration Those songs which youre refined tounge shall singe. But what doe I prolonge my tedious speache, Hindringe the forwarde hastninge of youre steps? Goe happilie with a swifte swallowes winge To Hellicon faire, that pure and happie springe. Returne triumphant with youre laurell boughes, With PhÅbus trees decke youre deseruinge brows. Hast, hast with speede vnto that hallowed well. Soe take from mee a louinge longe farewell. Philomusus Farewell good father, and youre counsell sage Be my safe guide in this my Pilgrimage. Studioso Farewell good vncle, and youre wise said says Keepe mee from deuious and by wandringe wayes. Consiliodorus Farewell, farewell, to parte with youe is paine, But haste, let not the sunn lighte burne in vain. [Exit.] Philomusus Come Studioso, shall wee gett vs gone? Thinks thou oure softe and tender feet canne bide To trace this roughe, this harsh, this craggie waye That leadeth vnto faire Parnassus hill? Studioso Why man, each lazie groome will take the paine To drawe his slowe feete ore the clayie landes, Soe he maie reste vppon a faire greene banke. Theise pilgrims feete which nowe take wearie toile Maie one day on a bedd of roses rest Amidst Parnassus shadie laurell greene. Philomusus But cann wee hit this narowe curious waie Where are such by wayes and erronious paths? Saye whats the firste Ile wee muste trauell in? Studioso The firste lande that wee muste trauell in (as that oulde Hermite toulde me) is Logique. I haue gotten Iacke Setons mapp to directe vs through this cuntrie. This Iland is, accordinge to his discription, muche like Wales, full of craggie mountaines and thornie vallies. There are twoo robbers in this cuntrie caled Genus and Species, that take captiue euerie true mans Inuention that come by them; Pacius in his returne from Parnassus hadd beene robt by these twoo forresters, but for one Carterus, a lustie clubman, much like the Pinder of Wakfield, that defended him. Philomusus Come let vs iorney on with winged pace, Roughe way shall not dismay our studious mindes. Let vs then hasten to our wished port, Longe is our iorney, and the day is short. Then PhÅbus guide vs to thy Hellicon, And when oure ruder pipes are taught to singe The eccoinge wood with thy praise shall ringe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II Enter Madido alone reading Horace epistles. Madido O sweet Horace, if thou were aliue I woulde bestowe a cupp of sacke on thee for theise liquid verses; theise are not drie rimes like Catos Si deus est animus, but the true moist issue of a poeticall soule. O if the tapsters and drawers knewe what thou sayest in the co?enda?on of takinge of liquoure, they would score vp thy prayses vpon euerie But and barrell, &amp; in faith I care not if I doe for the benefite of the vnlearned bestowe some of my English poetrie vppon thy Latin rimes, that this Romane tonge maie noe longer out face our poore englishe skinkers. Ile onlie rouse vp my muse out of her den with this liquid sacrifice, and then haue amongste youe, poetes and rimers. (He drinks) The co?on people will now thinke I did drincke, and did nothinge but conferr with the ghostes of Homer, Ennius, Virgill, &amp; they rest that dwell in this watterie region. (He reads Horaces verses againe) Marke, marke, here springs a poeticall partridge. Zouns, I want a worde miserablely, I muste looke for another worde in my dictionarie: I shall noe sooner open this pinte pott, but the worde like a knaue tapster will crie anon anon Sr. (He drinks) Ey marye Sr, nowe I am fitt to write a book: woulde anie leaden Mydas, anie mossie patron haue his asses ears deified, let him but come, and giue mee some prettie sprinkling to mantaine the expences of my throate, and Ile dropp out suche an Encomi? on him, that shall i?ortalize him as longe as there is euer a booke binder in Englande. But I had forgotten my frind Horace: (He translates) take not in snuffe (my prettie verses) if I turne you out of youre Romane coate into an Englishe gaberdine. Enter Philomusus and Studioso. Philomusus In faith Madido thy poetrie is good, Some gallant Genius doth possess thy corps. Studioso I thinke a furie rauisheth thy braine, Thou art in such a sweet phantasticke vaine. But tell mee, shall wee haue thy companie Th[o]roughe this craggie ile, this harsh rough waye? Wilt thoue be pilgrime to Parnassus hill? Madido I had rather be a horse to grinde in mill. Zouns, I trauell to Parnassus? I tell thee its not a Pilgrimage for good wites; let slowe brainde Athenians trauel thither, those drie sober youths, which can away to reede dull lines, fustie Philosophers, dustie Logicians: Ile turne home, and write that that others shall reade, posteritie shall make them large note books out of my writings. Naye there is another thinge, that makes mee out of loue with this iorney, there is scarce a good tauerne or ale house betwixte this and Parnassus; why, a poeticall spirit muste needes starue. Philomusus Naye, when thou comes to high Parnassus hill Of Hellicons pure streame drincke thou thy fill. Studioso There Madido may quaff the poetes boule And satisfie his thristie dryed soule. Madido Nay, if I drinke of that pudled water of Hellicon in the companie of leane lenton shadowes, let mee for a punishement conuerse with single beare soe longe as I liue. This Parnassus and Hellicon are but the fables of the poetes, there is noe true Parnassus but the third lofte in a wine tauerne, noe true Hellicon but a cup of browne bastard. Will youe trauell quicklie to Parnassus, doe but carie youre drie feet into some drie tauerne, and straight the drawer will bid youe goe into the Halfe Moone, or the Rose, that is, into Parnassus; then call for a cup of pure Hellicon, &amp; he will bringe youe a cup of pure hypocrise, that will make youe speake leapinge lines and dauncinge periodes. Why, giue mee but a quart of burnt sacke by mee, and if I doe not with a pennie worth of candles make a better poeme then Kinsaders Satyrs, Lodges fig for Momus, Bastardes Epigrams, Leichfildes trimming of Nash, Ile giue my heade to anie good felowe to make a memento mori of. O, the gen[i]us of xijd a quart will indite manie liuelie lines in an houre, whils an ould drousie Academicke, an old Stigmaticke, an ould sober Dromeder toiles a whole month &amp; often scratcheth his wittes head for the bringinge of one miserable Period into the worlde. If therfore youe be good felowes, or wise felowes, trauell noe farther in the craggie way to the fained Parnassus, returne whome with mee, &amp; wee will hire our studies in a tauerne, &amp; ere longe not a poste in Pauls church yarde but shall be acquainted with our writings. Philomusus Nay then I see thy wit in drincke is drounde, Wine doth the beste parte of thy soule confounde. Studioso Let Parnass be a fond Phantasticke place, Yet to Parnassus Ile hould on my pace. But tell mee Madido, how camest thou to this Ile? Madido Well Ile tell youe, and then see if the phisicke of good counsel will worke vpon your bodies. I tooke shippinge at Qui mihi discipulus, &amp; sailed to Propria quÃ¦ maribus, then came to As in prÃ¦senti, but with great danger, for there are certaine people in this cuntrie caled schoolmaisters that take passingers &amp; sit all day whippinge pence out of there tayls; these men tooke mee prisoner, &amp; put to death at leaste three hundred rodes vpon my backe. Hence traueled I into the land of Sintaxis, a land full of Ioyners, and from thenc came I to Prosodia, a litell Iland, where are men of 6 feete longe, which were neuer mentioned in Sr Iohn Mandefildes cronicle. Hence did I set vp my vnluckie feet in this Ile Dialectica, where I can see nothinge but Idees and phantasmes. As soone as I came hither I began to reade Ramus his mapp, Dialectica est, &amp;c.; then the slouenlie knaue presented mee with such an vnsauorie worde that I dare not name it, vnless I had some frankensence readie to perfume youre noses with after. Vpon this I threw away the mapp in a chafe, and came home, cursing my witless head that woulde suffer my headless feete to take such a tedious iourney. Philomusus The harder and the craggier is the waye, The ioye will be more full another day. Ofte pleasure got with paine wee dearlie deeme, Thinges dearlie boughte are had in great esteeme. Madido Come on, come on, Tullies' Sentences. Leaue youre pulinge of prouerbs and hearken to him that knowes whats good for youe: if you haue anie care of youre eyes, blinde them not with goinge to Parnassus; if you loue youre feete, blister them not in this craggie waie. Staie with mee, and one pinte of wine shall inspire youe with more witt than all they nine muses. Come on, Ile leade youe to a merie companie. Studioso Fie Philomusus, gin thy loitringe feet To faint and tire in this soe faire a waie?

      <field name="fulltext">Act III Philomusus. Studioso. Stupido. Philomusus I faithe Studioso, I was almoste wonne To cleaue vnto yonde wett phantasticke crewe. I see the pinte pott is an oratoure, The burnt sacke made a sweet oration Againste Appollo and his followers: Discourste howe schollers vnregarded walke Like threed bare impecunious animals, Whiles seruinge men doe swagger it in silks, And each earth creepinge peasant russet coate Is in requeste for his well lined pouche: Tolde vs howe this laborious pilgrimage Is wonte to eate mens marrowes, drye there bloude, And make them seeme leane shadowes and pale ghostes. This counsell made mee haue a staggeringe minde, Vntill I sawe there beastlie bezolinge, There drowned souls, there idle meriment, Voyde of sounde solace and true hartes content. And nowe I loue my pilgrimage the more, I loue the Muses better than before. But tell mee, what lande do wee trauell in? Mee thinks it is a pleasante fertile soile. Studioso Let idle tongues talke of our tedious waye, I neuer sawe a more delicious earth, A smoother pathwaye, or a sweeter ayre Then here is in this lande of Rhetorique. Hearke howe the birds delight the mouing ayre With prettie tunefull notes and artless lays. Harke shrill Don Cicero how sweete he sings, See how the groues wonder at his sweet note And listen vnto theire sweet nightingale. Harken how Muretus, Bembus, Sadolet, Haddon and Ascham chirpe theire prettie notes And too good ears make tune full melodie: Theire chirping doth delight each mounte, each dale, Thoughe not so sweet as Tullies nightingale. Philomusus Indeede I like theire sugred harmonie, I like this grassie diapred greene earth: Heare tender feete maie trauell a whole daye And heare with ioy the aerye peoples laye. Enter Stupido. But who is yonder? Stupido I see. The earth hath ten times bine disrobbed quite Of her greene gowne and flowrie coueringe Since Stupido began his pilgrimage Vnto the place where those nine Muses dwell, And now our swifter feet haue ouertooke him. Studioso It is not our swifte feet but his slowe pace That makes vs ouertake him in this race. Ile interrupt his grauer meditations, Kindlie salutinge my frende Stupido.â Well ouertaken, Mr Stupido, I hope wee shall haue youre good companie To trauell, and directe vs in the waye That leads vs to that laureat twoo topt mounte. Stupido Welcome my welbeloued brethren, trulie (I thanke god for it) I haue spent this day to my great comfort; I haue (I pray god prosper my labours) analised a peece of an ho?elie according to Ramus, and surelie in my minde and simple opinion Mr Peter maketh all things verie plaine and easie. As for Setons Logique, trulie I neuer looke on it but it makes my head ache. And now not hauing anie serious business to goe aboute, leaste the bad disposed people should corrupte and contaminate my pure thoughtes by there vngodlie conversations, I am goinge abroad to take the benefite of the aire, and contemplate, whiles they play the reprobates at home, some persecutinge poore creaturs cattes: others spendinge there moste precious time in card plaie. But whither are you going, to Parnassus? Studioso Eye, and wee hope to haue youre companie. Stupido You speake like a yonge man indeede: I haue beene to vaine and forwarde this way, but now that I am come into this Rhetorique, and see the follie of theise vaine artes, I will not trauell a foot further. I haue a good man to my vncle, that neuer wore capp nor surples in his life, nor anie suche popishe ornament, who sent mee yesterday a letter, and this mandilion, and a frize coate for a token, and the same counsell that he gaue mee, I, as I am bounde in charitie, will giue you: studie not these vaine artes of Rhetorique, Poetrie, and Philosophie: there is noe sounde edifying knowledg in them; why, the[y] are more vaine than a paire of organs, or a morrice daunce. If you will be good men indeede, goe no further in this way, follow noe longer these profane artes, that are the raggs and parings of learning, sell all these bookes, and buye a good Martin, and twoo or three hundreth of chatechismes of Ieneuas printe, and I warrant you will haue learning enoughe. Mr Martin and other good men tooke this course. Philomusus Are then the artes foolish, prophane, and vaine That gotten are with studie, toile, and paine? Studioso Artistes, belike then, are phantastique fools That learne these artes in the laborious schools. Stupido Artistes fools, and that you may knowe by there vndecent apparell. Why, you shall not see a Rhetorician, a rimer, a poet (as you call it) but he wears such diabolicall ruffs, and wicked great breeches full of sin, that it would make a zelous professors harte bleed for grife. Well, Mr Wigginton and Mr Penorie neuer wore such prophane hose, but such plaine apparell as I doe. Goe with mee, and you shall heare a good man exercise; I will get him to handle for youre better direction this pointe by the way, I would gladlie doe some good of you, if I coulde. Philomusus I faith &amp;c. Stupido O sweare not, sweare not. Studioso With thee, my louing Stupido, weele wende And to thy counsell listning ears will lende. Stupido Folowe mee, Ile bringe youe into a sober companie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV Enter Amoretto alone reading these .2. verses out of Ouid. Amoretto Oscula qui sumpsit, qui non et cÃ¦tera sumpsit, Oscula quÃ¦ sumpsit perdere dignus erat. Who takes a kiss, and leaues to doe the rest, Doth take the worse, and doth neglect the beste. Zouns, what an honest animal was I To part with my Corinna with a kiss. Yet doe I wronge her deuine tempting lipps To name her kiss with noe more reuerence: One touche of her sweete Nectar breathinge mouth Would rauishe senceless Cinicks with delight And make them homage doe at Venus shrine. All books are dull which speake not of her praise: Hange ploddinge doultes and all there dulled race, True learninge dwels in her faire beautuous face. I loue thee Ouid for Corinnas sake, Thou loues Corinna as turtle loues her make. Of my Corinnaes haire loue makes his nett To captiuate poore mortall wandringe hartes; Loue keeps his reuels in Corinnas browes, Daunses Leualtoes in her speaking eye, Dyes and is buried in her dimpled cheeke, Reuiues and quickens in her cherie lipps, Keeps watch and warde in her faire snowie chin, That noe roughe swaine approach, or enter in; Loues cradle is betwixte her rising brest, Ther sucking Cupid feedes, and takes his rest: Touch not her mount of ioy, it is deuine, There Cupid grazes or els he would pine. Expect the world my poesie ere longe Where Ile co?ende her daintie quivering thighe, Sing of her foot in my sweet minstralsie. Enter Philomusus and Studioso. But who comes yonder, Philomusus, and Studioso? I saw them latelie in the companie Of stricte Stupido that pulinge puritane, A mouing peece of clay, a speaking ass, A walking image and a senceless stone. If they be of his humor, I care not I For such pure, honest seeminge companie. Philomusus Fye Studioso, what nowe almost caught By Stupido that plodding puritane? That artless ass &amp; that earthcreeping dolt, Who, for he cannot reach vnto the artes, Makes showe as though he would neglect the artes And cared not for the springe of Hellicon. Studioso Who can resist seeminge deuotion Or them that are of the reformed world? A flintie harte muste needes relent to see A puritane vp twinckling of his eye, Muche like a man newlie cast in a traunce Or like a cuntrie fellowe in a daunce. Philomusus Eye, these doe norishe a neglected bearde, Much like a grunting keeper of a hearde; Speake but fewe wordes because the[y] would seeme wise, Weare but a plaine coate after the wonted guise. Thou owest mee thanks, for but for mee I wis Thou hadest beene a plaine puritane ere this. Studioso I kept thee Philomusus from moiste Madido, Thou sauest mee latelie fr? dull Stupido. Amoretto And are they parted fr? strict Stupido? Then are they fit for my societie.â What Philomusus and Studioso, well met in faith in the lande of Poetrie, how doe youe away with this aire? Philomusus Well met Amoretto, I did longe To meete some poet of a pleasante tounge. Studioso It argueth the goodnes of the aire Because here breathes full manie a cruell faire. Amoretto Indeede this lande hath manie a wantome nymphe That knowes alwayes all sportfull dalliance. Here are soe manie pure brighte shininge starrs That Cynthiaes want theire faire Endimions Wherewith to pass away the loittring nighte. Here are Corinnaes, but here Ouids wante. Saye, will you staie with mee in Poetrie? Why shoulde you vainelie spende your bloominge age In sadd dull plodding on philosophers Which was ordained for wantome merrimentes? Studioso Yea but our springe is shorte, and winter longe: Our youth by trauellinge to Hellicon Must gett prouision for our latter years. Amoretto Who thinks on winter before winter come Maks winter come in sommers fairest shine. There is noe golden minte at Hellicon. Cropp you the ioyes of youth while that you maye, Sorowe and grife will come another daye. Philomusus I alwayes was sworne Venus seruitoure, I haue a wantome eye for a faire wenche. Hee is noe man, but a rude senceless ass That doth not for refined beautie pass. Perswade thou Studioso if thou can, And Ile be Cupides loyall duteous man. Studioso I am not suche a peece of Cinicke earthe That I neglect sweete beauties deitie. I reuerence Venus, and her carpet knightes That in that wantom warfarre weare theire lipps, Yet loth I am our Pilgrimage to staie In wantom dalliance and in looser playe. Amoretto Tushe, talke not of youre purposed pilgrimage, Nor doe forsake this poetes pleasant lande To treade vpon philosophers harshe grounde. Taste but the ioyes that poetrie affordes And youle all crabbed solaceis forsweare. Ile bringe you to sweet wantoninge yonge maides Wheare you shall all youre hungrie sences feaste, That they, grow[n]e proude with this felicitie, Shall afterwarde all maner obiect scorne. Nor are they puling maides, or curious Nuns That strictlie stande vpon virginitie: Theile freelie giue what ere youre luste shall craue And make you melte in Venus surque[d]rie. These ioyes, and more, sweete poetrie affordes: Let not youre headless feete forsake this lande Till you haue tasted of this ioyisance. Come, to my sweet Corinna Ile you bringe And bless youe with a touch of her softe lipps. Then shall you haue the choice of earthlie starrs That shine on earth as Cynthia in her skye; There maie youe melte with solled sweet delighte And taste the ioyes of the darke gloomie night. Studioso Well said the poet, that a wantom speache Like dallyinge fingers tickles vp the luste. Chast thoughtes can lodge no longer in that soule That lendes an eare to wantom poesie. Well Ile staie somwhat longer in this lande To cropp those yoyes that Amoretto speakes of: If in them anie sounde contente I finde Ile leaue Parnassus waie that is behinde. Philomusus Let not thenuious time hinder that ioye That wee shall tast in this thy Poetrie. Luste is impatient of all slack delaye; Come Amoretto, lettes noe longer staye. PhÅbus hath laid his golden tressed locks In the moist cabinet of Thetis lapp; Now shadie night hath dispossest the daye, Prouiding time for maides to sporte &amp; playe. Amoretto Come haste with mee vnto faire beauties beddes, On Venus pillow shall you laye youre heades. Philomusus Lustes wonte to ride on a faire winged steede. Studioso Noe maruell, when he lookes for suche a meede.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V Philomusus. Studioso. Studioso Howe sourelie sweete is meltinge venerie: It yealdeth honie, but it straighte doth stinge. Ile nere hereafter counsell chaster thoughtes To trauell through this lande of Poetrie. Here are entisinge Pandars, subtile baudes, Catullus, Ouid, wantome Martiall: Heare them whilest a lasciuious tale they tell, Theile make thee fitt in Shorditche for to dwell. Here had wee nighe made shipwracke of our youthe And nipte the blossomes of our buddinge springe. Yet are wee scaped frome Poetries faire baites And sett our footinge in Philosophie. Philomusus Noe soure reforminge enimye of arte Coulde doe delightfull poetrie more wronge Than thy vnwarie sliperie tongue hath done. Are these the thankes thou giuest for her mirthe Wherewith shee did make shorte thy pilgrims waye, Made monthes seeme minutes spente in her faire soile? O doe not wronge this musicke of the soule, The fairest childe that ere the soule broughte foorthe, Which none contemne but some rude foggie squires That knowe not to esteeme of witt or arte. Noe Epitaphe adorne his baser hearse That in his life time cares not for a verse. Nor thinke Catullus, Ouid, Martiall Doe teache a chaste minde lewder luxuries. Indeede if leachers reade a wantome clause It tickles vp each lustfull impure vaine, But who reades poets with a chaster minde Shall nere infected be by poesie. An honest man that nere did stande in sheete Maye chastlie dwell in vnchaste Shordiche streete. Take this from mee, a well disposed minde Shall noe Potato rootes in poetes finde. Studioso I doe not whet my tongue gainste poetrie, Yet maye youe giue a looser leaue to talke. Longe haue wee loitred idle in [t]his lande, Her ioyes made us vnmindfull of our waie, Our feet are growne too tender and unapte To trauell in the roughe Philosophie. Nowe cheare thy selfe in this laborious facte, Nor like a sluggarde fainte in the laste acte. Philomusus Indeede the pleasure poetrie did yelde Made further harshnes to philosophie; Yet hauinge skilfull Aristotle our guide I hope wee soone shall end our pilgrimage. Enter Ingenioso. A plague on youe, Iauel, Tollet, Tarteret, they haue poysned mee with there breathes. Philomusus Why how nowe Ingenioso, shewing Philosophie a faire paire of heeles? Studioso Why, whit[h]er nowe in a chafe Ingenioso? Ingenioso What, Philomusus and Studioso: well met ould schoolefelowes. I haue beene guiltie of mispending some time in Philosophie, and nowe growinge wiser I begin to forsake this cuntrie as faste as I can, and can youe blame mee? Whie I haue bene almoste stifled with the breath of three Barbarians, Tollet, Iauel, Tarterett. They stande fearfullie gapinge, and euerye one of them a fustie moulie worde in his mouthe thats able to breede a plague in a pure aire: they breede suche an ayre as is wonte to proceede from an euaporatinge dunghill in a summers daye. But what doe youe twoo here, in this griggie barbarous cuntrie? Philomusus Wee pilgrims are vnto Parnassus hill, At Hellicon wee meane to drinke our fill. Ingenioso What, goe soe farr to fetche water, goe to Parnassus to conuerse with ragged innocentes? If youe be wise, and meane to liue, come not there. Parnassus is out of siluer pitifullie, pitifullie. I talked with a frende of mine, that latelie gaue his horse a bottell of haye at the bottome of the hill, who toulde mee, that Apollo had sente to Pluto to borowe twentie nobles to paye his co?ons: he added further, that hee met co?ing downe from the hill a companie of ragged vicars and forlorne schoolemaisters, who as the[y] walked scrached there vnthriftie elbowes, and often putt there handes into there vnpeopled pocketes, that had not beene possessed with faces this manie a day. There one stoode digginge for golde in a standishe; another looking for cockpence in the bottome of a pue: the third towling for siluer in a belfree: but they were neuer soe happie as Esopes cocke to finde a precious stone: nay they coulde scarse get enoughe to apparell there heade in an vnlined hatt, there bodie in a frize Ierkin, and there feet in clouted paire of shoes. Come not there, seeke for pouertie noe further, its too farr to goe to Parnassus to fetche repentance. Philomusus Thoughe I foreknowe that doultes possess the goulde, Yet my intended pilgrimage Ile houlde. Studioso Within Parnassus dwells all sweet contente, Nor care I for those excrementes of earthe. Ingenioso Call youe gold and siluer the excrementes of earth? If those be excrementes, I am the cleanest man vpon the earth, for I seldome sweate goulde. Philomusus Yes they are excrementes, and henc a man that wantes money is caled a cleane gentleman. Ingenioso If that be to be cleane, then the water of Hellicon will quicklie make youe cleane: it is an excellent good thinge, to make a man impecunious. Studioso Come, shall wee haue youre companie on the waye? Ingenioso What, I trauell to Parnassus? Why I haue burnt my bookes, splitted my pen, rent my papers, and curste the cooseninge artes, that brought mee vp to noe better fortune. I, after manie years studie, hauinge almoste brought my braine into a consumption, looking still, when I shoulde meete with some good MÃ¦cenas, that liberallie would rewarde my desertes, I fed soe long vpon hope, till I had almoste starued. Why, our emptie handed sattine sutes doe make more accounte of some foggie faulkner, than of a wittie scholler, had rather rewarde a man for setting of a hayre, than a man of wit for making of a poeme. Eache long eared ass rides on his trappinges and thinkes it sufficiente to giue a scholler a maiesticke nodd with his rude nodle. Goe to Parnassus? Alas, Apollo is banckroute, there is nothing but siluer wordes &amp; golden phrases for a man; his followers wante the goulde, while tapsters, ostlers, carters, and coblers haue a fominge pauch, a belchinge bagg that serues for a cheare of est[ate] for regina pecunia. Seest thou not my hoste Iohns of the Crowne, who latelie liued like a moule .6. yeare vnder the grounde in a cellar, and cried anon, anon Sr, now is mounted vpon a horse of twentie marke, and thinkes the earth too base to beare the waighte of his refined bodie? Why, woulde it not greeue a man of a good spirit to see Hobson finde more money in the tayles of 12 Iades, than a scholler in 200 bookes? Why, Newman the cobler will leaue large legacies to his haires, while the posteritie of humanissimi auditores and esse posse videatur must be faine to be kept by the parishe. Turne home againe, vnless youe meane to be vacui viatores, and to curse youre wittless heades in youre oulde age for takinge themselues to no better trades in there youthe. Studioso Cease to mispende more of thy id[l]e breathe Effecting to diuert vs from our waye. I knowe that schollers co?onlie be poore And that the dull worlde there good partes neglecte. A schollers coate is plaine, lowlie his gate: Contente consists not in the highest degree. Philomusus I thinke not worse of faire Parnassus hill For that it wantes that sommers golden clay, The idol of the foxfurd vsurer. Though it wantes coyne it wantes not true contente, True solace, or true hartie merrimente. If thou will weende with vs plucke up thy feete, If not, farewell till next time wee doe meete. Ingenioso Farewell, and take heede I take youe not napping twentie yeares henc in a viccars seate, asking for the white cowe with the blacke foote, or els interpretinge Pueriles Confabulationes to a companie of seauen yeare olde apes. Philomusus Farewell Ingenioso, and take heede I finde not a ballet or a pamphlet of thy makinge. Studioso Come Philomusus, chearfullie lets warke: Our toiling day will haue a night to rest Where wee shall thinke with ioy on labors past. Leade on a pace, Parnassus is at hande, Nowe wee haue almost paste this wearie lande. [Exeunt.] Enter Dromo, drawing a clowne in with a rope. Clowne What now, thrust a man into the co?on wealth, whether hee will or noe? What the deuill should I doe here? Dromo Why, what an ass art thou? Dost thou not knowe a playe cannot be without a clowne? Clownes haue bene thrust into playes by head &amp; shoulders, euer since Kempe could make a scuruey face, and therfore reason thou shouldst be drawne in with a cart rope. Clowne But what must I doe nowe? Dromo Why if thou canst but drawe thy mouth awrye, laye thy legg ouer thy staffe, sawe a peece of cheese asunder with thy dagger, lape vp drinke on the earth, I warrant thee, theile laughe mightilie. Well, Ile turne thee loose to them, ether saie somwhat for they selfe, or hang &amp; be non plus. Exit. Clowne This is fine y faith: nowe, when they haue noe bodie to leaue on the stage, the[y] bringe mee vp, &amp; which is worse, tell mee not what I shoulde saye. Gentles, I dare saie youe looke for a fitt of mirthe, Ile therfore present vnto you a proper newe loue letter of mine to the tune of Put on the smock a mundaye, which in the heate of my charitie I pende, and thus it begins: O my louely Nigra, pittie the paine of my liuer: that litell gallowes Cupid hath latelie prickt mee in the breech with his great pin, and almoste kilde mee thy woodcocke with his birdbolte. Thou hast a prettie furrowed forheade, a fine leacherous eye, me thinkes I see the bawde Venus keeping a bawdie house in thy lookes, Cupid standing like a Pandar at the doore of thy lipps.âHow like you maisters, has anie yonge man a desire to copie this, that he may haue form? epistolÃ¦ conscribendÃ¦? Now if I could but make a fine scuruey face I were a kinge. O nature, why didest thou giue mee soe good a looke? [Re-enter Dromo, with Philomusus and Studioso.] Dromo Giue vs a voyder here for the foole. Sirra you muste begone, here are other men that will supplie the roome. Clowne Why, shall I not whistle out my whistle? Then farewell gentle auditors, &amp; the next time you see mee Ile make you better sporte. [Exeunt Dromo and Clowne.] Philomusus Nowe endes the trauell of on[e] tedious daye. In .4. years haue wee paste this wearie waye. Nowe are wee at the foote of this steepe hill Where straght our tired feet shall rest there fill. Studioso Seest thou how yonder laurell shadie groue Is greene in spite of frostie Boreas, Scorninge his roughe blastes and vngentle breath That makes all trees mourne in a mossye ragg? Nere let the pilgrims to this laurell mounte Fainte or retire in this theire pilgrimage Through the misleading of some amorous boye, Some swearinge vnthrifte, or some blockishe dolte, Or throughe the counsell of some wilie knaue. Nowe let us boldlie rushe amonge theese trees And heare the Muses tunefull harmonie. Philomusus Let vulgar wittes admire the co?on songes, Ile lie with PhÅbus by the Muses springes Where wee will sit free fro' all enuies rage And scorne eache earthlie Gullio of this age. Studioso Haste hither all good wittes with winged speede Where youre faire browes shall haue a laureat meede, And youe that loue the Muses deitie Giue our extemporall showe the Plaudite.</field>
