      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Sweno. Ubald. Reynald. Knights, Guests, Messengers, and Attendants. Bertha. Agnes. The Wanderer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene in JutlandâSweno's Castle and its vicinity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Time, about 30 hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âSweno's Hall; a Banquet. Sweno, Ubald, Reynald, Bertha, Agnes, Knights, Ladies, and Attendants. SWENO. Sit, lords, and be the draught of pleasure fill'd E'en to the goblet's brink! We bid you welcome. And thou, dear lady, whose hand lock'd in mine, As on this day, twenty blithe years have witness'd, We pledge thee in this brimming cup of love. GUESTS, (drinking.) Health and long life to Sweno and his dame! BERTHA. Thanks, gentles, for this courtesy. SWENO. My Bertha, Time has sped well with us. Our lovely hostess Wears yet the hue of freshness unalloy'd, While her ripe scion, our sweet Agnes, glows With beauty's blush, like a new beam of morning. We lack not aught, wherewith to tax the fates As niggards of their gifts, being doubly blest In our loved daughter and adopted son. Ubald, thy prowess in each listed field Speaks no mean lineage. As my child I greet thee. UBALD. If to revere you as man's noblest type, To love you as my worthier self, to prize The far-famed honors of your noble house As things most dear, which from ill chance to shield, I would encounter danger in such shapes As human daring may but ill assay, Be a son's duty, it is freely paid, And Ubald still the debtor. Good my lord, Your kindness makes me bankrupt of all thanks, Save the poor service of a faithful arm To ward your rights. SWENO. And we dare trust it, Ubald, Though half our honors hung on the event. To-morrow, sirs, it is our mind to hold A gorgeous tournament, and, by my knighthood, Who wins hath leave to be our daughter's suitor. Good Reynald, is thy lance as keen and strong, As when it tumbled the grim Saracen, Horseman and horse, tilting in Palestine? REYNALD. Ay, noble Sweno; and a lovelier prize Makes not the hand more sluggard in the charge. I pledge my glove to win. SWENO. Take it, young Ubald, And may all guardian saints to-morrow speed thee! So in the tilt thou dost approve thee victor, Loud proclamation shall our heralds make To all who dare impugn thy long-lost birthright; And, if none answer to that bold appeal, Valiant we know thee, and shall hold thee noble. UBALD. Ay, marry will I. If he cast his gauntlet, And this arm thrust him from his saddle-bow, By heaven and good Saint Olaf, he shall eat it, As that huge dragon, which he slew in Syria, Would have gulp'd up the princess of .......âPlague on it! I cannot scan the name of half those regions Whence he has scared the devil and his imps. REYNALD, (rising.) Sweno, I was bred in war, and learnt the laws Of knightly courtesy which arrests mine anger. I know both what is due to host and guests; Nor would I stain thy social board with blood E'en of one chattering pie; else, taunting youth, I well remember, how in Holy Land, When a base renegade provoked my scorn By some light speech, I slew the turban'd caitif With his own rapier. UBALD. And made his bare skull A bonnet for thy mistress. SWENO. Peace, peace, Ubald. Let us have music. Friends, the merry Bacchus Brims not your flowing cups with wonted glee. Agnes, we tax thy sweet voice for a song. Music. AGNES sings. I. With a turf at her feet, In her winding-sheet, Shall Elfrid lie where the wild winds howl; But the deathless shame Of her lost, lost, fame, Shall weigh like a stone on the fair one's soul. II. There's a curse above Upon faithless love, Can turn the morning's ray to dead midnight; There's a secret voice, When false lords rejoice, Can change to dark anguish their soul's delight. III. The curse shall cling To the bridal ring Of the faithless lord who left her to mourn; An angel in the sky Has graven it on high On a scroll of fire that can ne'er be torn. IV. His bride is gay, And his children play, While Elfrid lies where the wild winds roar; The fiend has set his mark On their heads dark, dark, And the spirit of vengeance is near his door. (While she is singing, Sweno appears strangely agitated, and interrupts her when she has just uttered the word vengeance.) SWENO. 'Tis a fiend's song. Where gat you that foul strain, Crossing our mirth with such portentous sounds, As if the deep could send the unshrouded dead To scare us from our joys? AGNES. Father, it bodes not Evil to us; a wild lay, long since learnt From a wierd woman that craved alms: the notes So sweetly rung in mine attentive ear, Time has not robb'd me of their melody. (Thunder and lightning, which had begun faintly while she was singing, becomes loud and bright, with noise of violent rain. The agitation of Sweno increases.) SWENO. The heavens frown on this our festival. 'Tis passing strange, that sounds of such dire omen Should break upon our wassail; quelling the pulse Of high-born mirth; turning the cheek of joy To very paleness. Daughter, thy sad notes Breathe an infectious gloom, and our kind guests Have miss'd the scope of that sweet mirth we wish'd them. (Rising.) The tempest waxes, and this ancient castle Rocks with the blast. May the sun's kindlier beam Smile on our pomp to-morrow. I crave your leave. Health and light thoughts attend our welcome friends. [Exeunt Sweno, Ubald, Bertha, Agnes and others. Manent Reynald and two other Knights.] REYNALD. Great heaven! is this the man, whose mighty name Is blown to the four corners of Christ's empire, Famed for stern valor, marshalling in war With proud array his feudatory swords Like a half-king in Jutland! To be thus moved! FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis the distemper of his inward nature. The subtle fluid of that flaming mischief Which gives the thunder voice, steals to his heart With secret sickness, curdling all the blood Till his flesh creeps. SECOND KNIGHT. Ay; ever since that morn, Which to his wedded couch gave noble Bertha. FIRST KNIGHT. 'Twas a rough morn. The curse of that fair maid, Who perish'd in the flood, hath ever since Weigh'd like a stone on his distemper'd soul. SECOND KNIGHT. By heaven, methinks, when piping winds do blow, Her form is manifest to his estranged eye, As when she stood on the rock's slippery verge That morn by Helen's chapel. REYNALD. Sirs, to me Your words speak riddles. SECOND KNIGHT. Heard you ne'er the tale? 'Tis twenty years by-gone, as on this morn, Since Sweno led, with pomp and bravery Of princely cost, his bride unto the altar In Helen's chapel, built on the beetling rock Over the torrent, when Saint Mary's church Lay under the Pope's ban, for a foul murder Done in the very aisle while mass was singing. REYNALD. I have mark'd its site, a wild romantic spot; And its high tower a goodly structure, now Half ruinous: 'tis said that evil spirits Shriek oft at night within its lonesome walls. SECOND KNIGHT. 'Tis like they may; it hath been long disused, A darksome fabric now, and the bleak winds Howl through its broken casements. FIRST KNIGHT. But that morn Of blazing tapers there was cost enough. SECOND KNIGHT. 'Twas a gay pomp; but, as the nuptial train, Advancing, near'd that huge o'er-shelving rock Fast by the stream, the shrill winds mustering stirr'd With such fierce outrage, that each flag was rent, And the thick clouds seem'd big with lowering tempest. When, as they 'gan ascend, a form above Stood with dishevell'd hair, that stream'd upon The blustering gale. It was the loveliest shape, My eyes ere then or since have witness'd; pale As the chaste moon, and sad as sorrow's statue: But a wild fierceness lighten'd from her looks, As, with one hand out-stretch'd, she gave her words To the rude blast of heaven. I heard them not With clear precision render'd to mine ear, But it was bruited, that on princely Sweno And all his race she breathed a deadly curse, Summoning them to the dread throne of judgment. REYNALD. Whence and who was she? SECOND KNIGHT. It was never known; She vanish'd like a wraith; but on a bough, Which overhung the swoln stream's eddying foam, Her mantle was found, drench'd by the angry flood; And 'tis past doubt, she perish'd in the waters, Which roar'd that night, as they would burst their bed. REYNALD. How fared the bridal? SECOND KNIGHT. Sad as a death-wake. The bridegroom rapt in care, like one distraught By some dark agony; his lovely bride Trembling and ashy pale: and all the while The thunder raved with such rebounding roar, That the roof quaked, and the blue lightning's blaze Made every face like a gaunt spectre glare. FIRST KNIGHT. Ne'er has good Sweno, since that ominous morn, Held the mind's peaceful tenor. When winds roar, And the hoarse thunder makes the welkin tremble, His heart seems touch'd as by some icy hand, Shrivelling its core; and some deep cankering wound, That preys within his soul, bleeds fresh and green. REYNALD. 'Tis past belief, in one, whose actions swell Fame's chronicle, far-told; filling the ear Of expectation with amazing deeds; Lending new lustre to renowned war. FIRST KNIGHT. There doth not breathe a more undaunted knight Than this same Sweno, saving that touch of weakness, Unless it be yon flower of chivalry, All conquering Ubald, fame and fortune's minion. REYNALD. Whence sprung that fiery youth, whose haughty eye Lords o'er this court, as if created man Was form'd for him, not he to yield man service; So confident, and reckless? SECOND KNIGHT. Faith I know not. The lady Bertha found him, a weak infant, Cradled midst roses and all summer sweets In that fair chamber, now young Agnes' bower, Fast by the blooming garden. The strange elf, Lapt in deep slumber, smiled, and waking stretch'd Its little arms as if imploring kindness; And she, just risen from a matron's throes, To pitying love by that endearment moved, Kiss'd its chill'd lips that ask'd the milk of nature, And on her beauteous bosom bade it hush. Protection first, then favor he obtain'd, Waxing in years, and worth, and valor; proud As if from kingly blood, hot as a lion, And mastering all spirits by his strength, The people's darling, and the bolt of battle. FIRST KNIGHT. Saving your prowess, I would pawn my sword He wins to-morrow: for of Denmark's knights There lives not one can stand this Ubald's onset. REYNALD. Is it thus? Yet shall he find one shaft too doughty, Tried oft at Acre and at Ascalon, Which hath beat down the brunt of Mahound's chieftains, Though arm'd with spells of Paynim sorcery. FIRST KNIGHT. God speed you, sir! 'Twill be no mean encounter Shall stoop his crest to-morrow. SECOND KNIGHT. Till then, Reynald, Let us be joyous, and with some free cheer Kill lagging time. REYNALD. E'en so; we have seen no spectres; And yet methinks all heaven's blasts are stirring, And its rent bosom seems one sheet of flame. [Exeunt. Scene II. A Grove in the Garden before the Castle, which is seen through the trees. The storm is abating. THE WIERD WANDERER (alone.) Hist! hist! Wild striving elements, be still, Ominous and still, as brooding mischief is! When the fell draft of vengeance shall be quaff'd E'en to its bloody dregs, then, then laugh out, Thou damned spirit of the storm! Foul fiend, Hast thou so many years of loneliness, Whispering revenge, still borne me fellowship, And now, when fate's retributory curse Draws nigh to the achievement, canst thou not wait For hellish joy, till the full spell be woven? Hist! hist! and thou, bright sun, shine forth in glory, Until the moment of appointed justice! The day has been, when I could ill have bided The pitiless tempest and that strife of nature; But sold to fiends, I dread not now their workings, Lost in despair, and reft of every gift That makes life joyousâHark! 'Tis Sweno's voice! The morn shall not dawn twice, ere thou be summon'd To thy doom! life for life!âAway! away! [Exit. [Enter from the Castle, Sweno, Bertha.] SWENO. The bolts have spent their fire; yon lurid cloud Still, and disburthen'd of its teeming wrath, Hangs like a misty shroud on the horizon. The air is calm; Bertha, I breathe more freely. BERTHA. Nay, good my lord, I needs must hold it strange E'en to the natural temper of your soul, That you, so far removed from taint of fear, Instant in danger, firm in resolution, Should start, thus from yourself estranged and wild, At these rude flaws of nature, making Unkind divorce between your alter'd thoughts And that sweet peace they owe you. SWENO. O loved Bertha, There be some thoughts too deep for time to medicine, Which on the seemliest and freshest cheek Would stamp dread's livery, though the heart were steel. BERTHA. What thoughts? strange roamings of the troubled fancy, Air-blown imagination's empty bubble! For shame, my lord; this is the bodiless spectre Of that poor maniac, whose ill-omen'd vision Comes, like the shadow of a passing cloud, O'er the bright mirror of your better judgment. Fie on't, a dream. SWENO. Would that it were a dream, That I could shake the wrathful spectre from me! The curse of that dread hour will live for ever. Call Agnes forth: I have a fearful thought, Some secret evil overhangs my child. Perchance her sight may soothe me. BERTHA. Be more cheerly; Sweno, our guests attend us. [Exit BERTHA. SWENO (alone.) Vengeful fate, Dost thou indeed pursue me! Will not years Atone for one offence! Last night methought A voice as from my father's tomb cried, âSweno, âThine hour is come! the curse is o'er thine house!â To-day, as I approach'd the festive hall, That flaming cherub seem'd to bar my passage, Which in my life's most prosperous hours of pride, A dreadful vision, oft has cross'd my path. [Enter AGNES.] SWENO, (embracing her.) Ever beloved, forefend thee, gracious heaven! Thy father's heart is sad. AGNES. My honor'd sire, This is the very breathing hour of bliss; The storm is roll'd away, and merry birds Do trick their plumes, and sing their cheerful welcome To the mild beam of evening. SWENO. The heart of youth Is ever blithe and buoyant. AGNES. Good my father, To-day my wayward strain offended you. Shall I sing one, which oft has sooth'd your fancy In the slow hours of sickness? Much you praised Its melody, and somewhat the poor skill That gave it voice. SWENO. No, not a song, my Agnes. Music itself is out of tune to-day; Thy gladsomest notes would fall upon my ear E'en as a passing knell. AGNES. Yet is this day Held festive in our annals, chief for me And my loved father. SWENO. Beshrew me, noble maid, If thou shalt lack the joys that well beseem Thy spring of life. The heyday of my blood Is chill'd by the mind's winter; nature wears not That bland aspect, which to the eye of youth Shows all her forms in pleasant colors deck'd. Thou shalt not miss delights or princely state, While Sweno girds a sword. AGNES. I lack no joys In thy kind presence: from thy brow to chase The gloom, to sing to thee my playful ditties Winning thy lips to smile, and in thine eyes To read a father's blessing, these are joys Enough for Agnes; nor of gayer sports Is the voice hush'd in bounteous Sweno's palace. [Enter UBALD.] SWENO. How fare our guests? UBALD. Sweno, we miss thy presence. Upon my troth thou hast a royal guest! That knight drinks deep, but yet his boastful speech Shames his poor draught. SWENO. The noble Reynald, Ubald? UBALD. Ay, he from Palestine. O I could pluck the beard Of such a vaunter! Pshaw! it moves my spleen To see a comely knight and stout withal First praise his wine, then praise himself more largely, Still giving birth to some amazing tale Between the cup and lip. Why, sir, this man Kills you more sultans with each draught he quaffs Than there be signs in the bright zodiac.âArthur, And he who slew the dragon, hight Saint George, Were puny champions! Agnes, this proud gallant Will purge all Heathendom, and place his bride Upon the top-stone of Jerusalem. A murrain on such talkers! SWENO. Thy blood, Ubald, Knows no controul. Reynald stands well esteem'd, And many a hard field has he fought beside England's bold lion Richard. UBALD. Ay, so he has; And mown the heads of Paynim sorcerers As boys slay poppies. So it stands recorded Even on the faith of his own boastful speech. Ubald must vail his crest to such high worth. (taking off his helmet, and walking impatiently.) SWENO. Rein thy rash temper. Something bodes within me That evil hangs over the house of Sweno; Perchance from thy quick passion. O my daughter, If this thy hairbrain'd playmate should be victor, Thou wilt have a wild bridegroom. UBALD. O good sir, I am rejected, scorn'd! I have not taken A soldan by the beard in Ascalon. SWENO. God speed thee, boy. Time was the riotous blood So kindled in my veins; but now the frost Of years steals o'er my pride. No son of mine Shall reap my ample honors; when I fall, My house is lonely. Ubald, it needs a prop, And who shall take this guerdon from my hand With her rich heritage, must stand approved In feat of arms unrivall'd. UBALD. Princely Sweno, Forgive the hasty and impatient spirit Which boils within me. Whom have I on earth But thee, my more than father? Witness heaven, If Ubald harbours in his ardent soul One wish, but to be worthy thee and thine! SWENO. And so perchance thou art. That lofty temper Which gleams from out thy soul, shows some high birthright, Though unreveal'd.âAgnes, we tarry long. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SceneâA Grove of Ancient Trees with a View of the Castle. A fine Evening after the Storm. THE WANDERER, (alone.) The storm is hush'd; the turmoil'd elements slumber, And the fierce gale, which rock'd those battlements, Is lull'd and motionless. Meek Nature now, Her fitful passion o'er, sleeps like an infant, A playful smile bedewing its moist lips As its eye sinks in stillness.âThere is pleasure In the calm aspect of the firmament E'en when the mind is phrensied. The gaunt wretch, Midst hideous shapes that haunt his fever'd couch, Blesses the day-breeze, and the soothing light That beams from the blue heaven. How sweet the breath Of this mild evening! It steals over me With thoughts that have been long foregone. O Nature, Parent of our best joys, how have I scared thee! Through what terrific mazes has the fiend Led my despairing steps! These aged trees Spread their green honors to the sun that gilds them In beauty yet unblighted, as when first I trod their shade in youth: but vengeful thoughts Have prey'd upon my vitals; they have gnaw'd Like the foul worm in secret, till this form, Once ripe with loveliness, has grown a curse, A thing for wolves to bay, man's scorn and terror. (Starting with a look of derangement.) Hark, hark! It is my mother's shriek! I hear it; I hear it now: the sob, the frantic laugh Of my dead parent! They say the devil laughs, When murder is doing. Mother! Mother! look up! Know'st thou not me, thine own, thy blighted child? 'Twas thus when she was dying; she knew me not, Her strange eye fixt upon the vacant air! (Starting again.) Hark to that shriek again!âUnquiet spirit, Hush! hush!âVengeance is dark and silent; slow, But certain as the shaft of destiny. Here, like death's messenger, I yield my being To the achievement of that fearful vision, Perpetual inmate of my burning thoughts, By day my agony, the bitter dream Of my distemper'd nights. [Enter AGNES and UBALD.] See, where they come, Two heedless fowls, into the net of fate! Be still, weak heart! Hush. Hush. (She withdraws, and conceals herself in the hollow trunk of an old tree.) AGNES. The evening star, They say, is love's sweet harbinger. How its beam, Ere yet the sun has ta'en his last farewell, With every pleasant omen bids us welcome! After her boisterous throes Nature smiles on us. See, how each dewy flower is wreath'd with pearls! The sun all-radiant is with glory passing To his bright chamber. Seems it not so, love? UBALD. O Agnes, all my thoughts are full of joy; And the hot blood so tingles in my veins, Methinks I could outstrip his lazy course, Unto his orient palaces, and drag Star-throned Dominion from her seat in heaven. AGNES. O rash in valour, as in love most wild! UBALD. Nay, Agnes, on my troth I love thee soother Than the sick miser loves his hoarded pelf, Than the fat burgher his wine-mantled cup, Cowards their lives, sleek hypocrites their lies. I' faith, sweet lass, thou think'st I love thee well. AGNES. Thou art a saucy knave to say me thus. UBALD, (playfully.) Think'st thou, my Agnes, if love's hope were granted, Hymen his torch just lighting, all joys ready And fit appliances of blissful state, The bridal deck'd, chambers with perfume breathing, That my fond grasp would cling to this soft palm (taking her hand) As its best treasure? AGNES. Faith, it need not call The tell-tale blushes to a virgin's cheek, To cry thee, ay. UBALD, (laughing). Yet on my word I would not; So I must creep inglorious to thy couch, As the worm seeks its mate. My Agnes' husband Must be enshrined in the full blaze of glory. O I will place thee in such eminence, That men shall bow, women miss their proud looks, And all cry hail, as to the sun of nature! AGNES. Ah me! thou art a truant to true love. 'Twas ever thus; Agnes hath scarce a part In the impetuous yearnings of thy fancy. There is some charm, some ill-devised spell, That binds me closer to thy wayward soul, Else would I . . . . (she hesitates). UBALD, (smiling). What wouldst thou, Agnes? AGNES. (after a pause, leaning on him tenderly.) Love thee ever! And more for that untamed rebellious spirit, Which oft in every day's revolving space Thrills me with shapeless fears. O Ubald, Ubald, Agnes hath being but in thy look's sunshine. To be thine, thine, were bliss: of other union The thought with icy chill upon my heart Falls like death's warning. UBALD. Of another union! God's mercy! is not Agnes mine? my prize? My life, my better self? Have I not won thee, earn'd thee? Taken thee to my soul's core? my crown, my glory! AGNES. Would that to-morrow were past! The palm of strife Hangs on a slippery chance. Thine arm is matchless, But the weak flutter of a maiden's fear Draws the blood curdling to the seat of life, When in the balance hangs all hope of bliss, And in one scale is death. UBALD. My blushing trembler, What arm of man, in tourney or in war, Has bow'd my crest? Who has withstood my dint? And when this hand, worth mines of adamant, Is the high guerdon of the bloodless tilt, Will Ubald's arm be not itself to-morrow? AGNES. I should be fearless, for on thee my trust Leans with true confidence; my bosom throbs Responsive to hope's pulse, and still is joyous. UBALD. Speak ever thus! If valor could be lull'd, There is a charm in thy CircÃ«an smile Might steep it in perdition. AGNES. Dear Ubald, I well remember, I was scant thirteen, A wayward girl scarce witting what I loved, When one bright morn, beneath the embowering grove Deep in yon flowery garden, I was stretch'd. My hair all loose, my wimple cast aside, And my young fancy was upon the wing Shaping fond wishes; when, as I mine eyes Uplifted, by my side there stood a form Such as I ne'er had seen. Her dress was strange, And motley; her cheek wore a sallow hue, But ardent through that dark complexion glow'd A hectic flush: her look had such a spell As passes human tongue to tell or liken, The coiled serpent's spell, that charms its prey By the eye's glance; nor could I my face withdraw From the full speculation of that eye That gazed upon me, sweet, but sadly wild; A look, that seem'd to tell of other joys Than were familiar to her present garb. Her figure, though in guise terrific, show'd Perfect concordance, well-turn'd symmetry, And the fine features of her tawny face Seem'd beauty's ruin. UBALD. Certes a wierd woman; Such figures sometimes cross our path in life, Holding deep converse with our destinies, Which for small price they oft reveal most strangely. AGNES. 'Twas even so. Silent some while she stood, Then, with a voice that lack'd not melody, Pour'd a wild ditty, whose sweet-warbled notes Still vibrate strangely on my captived ear. Then gently on my hand she fix'd her touch, While I lay witched by that harmony, And with enquiring finger search'd my palm, Which I half fearful yielded, half content; And she would tell my fate, for such small coin As my young means might tender. UBALD. Did thine ear Receive her hidden lore? AGNES. O yes, my pulse Throbb'd high and quick with expectation. She said, my soul was weak, but apt for love, And, if I lack'd not courage, I should wed My soul's best treasure; but this threat subjoin'd, If knight or prince should win my fated hand, Who owed his state to aught save shining valor, Frightful perdition would o'erwhelm my house And his that wed me. UBALD. That strange tale is rife; And I do well believe, sweet flower of Jutland, Predicted ruin hath scared many a suitor, Whose lordly crest and richly purfled trappings Shrunk from the threat of fate. AGNES. Blest be that curse, Which daunts the prowess of unwelcome rivals! UBALD. Nay, sweetest, would I had a thousand rivals, And on each head a princely diadem, So I might pluck bright honor from their crests, And place it on my Agnes' brow of beauty! AGNES. Insatiable of glory! Will no thought Of thy loved Agnes win thy soul to mildness? O Ubald! if thine arm be blest to-morrow, Our course is level; the fair gales of heaven Will waft us to that fairy land of hope, Which we have gazed on, as the mariner After long peril of the boisterous seas. But if mischance attend thee, here I vow, By our best hopes, by all these maiden blushes, No force shall yield this hand, thine own true hand, To other lord: and well my soul assures me, (Though mystery hangs o'er thy secret birth) That Ubald came not of ignoble race. Valor and love uphold thine arm to-morrow! Till then, farewell. [Exit AGNES. UBALD (thoughtfully.) Of an ignoble race! It cannot be! I feel within me that, Which doth confirm me of proud origin. Else Why throbs my breast with aspirations Of such high nature? The steed bred for toil, Though pamper'd in the stall of lordly knights, Paws not the field, nor snuffs the air, and neighs, As the swift Arab, when the din of war Comes on his ears erect. Yet would I give Wealth, power, all pomp of pleasure, and all hope Save thee, loved Agnes, and this trusty sword, To know my sire. (He stands thoughtfully; The Wanderer comes forth unobserved.) WANDERER. Minion of valor, hail! UBALD. Ha! a wierd wanderer of the lonely forest! If knowledge dwells within that sallow breast, She shall resolve my fate.âWoman,âif woman, Nor rather of such beings as in deserts Have airy habitation!âcanst thou call To thy mind's eye the semblance of the past, And things still seal'd in the deep womb of time, Lifting the veil of mazy destiny? Speak what I am, what I shall be hereafter. WANDERER. Ubald, strange fates hang o'er thee. Thou shalt win, But winning lose, and in one day's short circle Thou shalt drain all the cup of bliss and anguish. UBALD. Foul prophetess, unfold thy hidden meaning. WANDERER. Peace, peace, rash youth. UBALD. Wierd woman, name my sire! WANDERER. I may not now. There is a spirit nigh, Which, if that name were breathed, would shriek aloud With such dire adjuration of revenge, That thy young heart would shrivel like a scroll Wrapt in devouring flames. UBALD. Nay then, my swordâ WANDERER. Impotent and vain! think'st thou, that death Has terrors, for who walks night's hideous round Like a bann'd spirit, to life's joys and light Than death itself more dead? UBALD. Fear'st not mine arm? WANDERER. As teeming tempest dreads the mutinous thunder; As the sea trembles when its billows roar. UBALD. Terrific woman, I adjure thee, name him. WANDERER. Men deem thee valiant, Ubald. Thou didst climb, A fearless stripling then, (myself did mark it,) The giddy height to the crag's beetling brow, And from its eyrie tore'st the unfledged eaglet. UBALD. 'Tis true; where never human step had clomb Upon the perilous edge, self-poised, I slew The parent savage screaming in mid air O'er the void chasm, and seized its callow young. WANDERER. Did that vain bauble fill thy soul? Below thee, Strong in its beauty, lay this smiling province And Sweno's stately dome. What were thy thoughts, Proud boy, as firm upon the slippery ledge Thy foot stood fix'd, and the keen eye survey'd All the wide plain beneath it? UBALD. Thou hast touch'd A string, to which this heart knows well to answer. By heaven, I gazed from that rash eminence With no mean pride. My eye stretch'd wide and far O'er fields and wastes, hamlets and haunts of men, E'en to the sea sail-studded; and methought E'en then, some heritage as fair and princely Should own me lord. WANDERER. And so perhaps 'tis written In the closed page of fate. A bloody star Glared o'er thy birth. Deeds must be done, ere thou Lord o'er the right of thy proud ancestry, Shall turn the pure sun red. Darest thou obey The fearful call of thine high destinies? UBALD. To the world's verge, though bottomless and unseen. Light thou the ominous beacon; let thine arm Point o'er the field of death, and I will follow! WANDERER. Valiant!â'tis well: but fame delivers thee, Though vain and choleric, yet weak withal, And the frail slave of woman. Darest thou win Thy way to vengeance, and re-assert thy name, Though white arms stretch to hold thee, and loved eyes Weep blood for pity? UBALD. What beseems a man, That Ubald dares, though all Circassia's smiles Were leagued to lure him. WANDERER. That which vengeance bids Beseems a man, and thine own wrongs demand it. Fate has no middle path. Dost thou love, Ubald? UBALD. Ask you me, prophetess? WANDERER. Death is in the kiss Of those smooth lips thou wooest. Durst thou see That beauteous form which thy weak fancy doats on, The hair dishevell'd and the white breast bared, Hang on thine arm for mercy, and yet, true To the stern call of vengeance, strike thy poniard E'en to her heart's blood, Ubald? UBALD. Curst of heaven! From what abhorr'd spring flows thine hellish speech? WANDERER. It is hell speaks! It is the voice of judgment From the deep throne of night! Hist! hist! I tell thee The eagle soars which soon must swoop in blood! The lordly eaglet from its eyrie cast Must plume its wing and flesh in gore its talons! UBALD. Woman, thy reason swims; thy thoughts are wild. WANDERER. I am not strange; sometimes the dizzy mist Hangs o'er my brain, and things, long past, seem present. 'Tis the mind's noontide now; the horizon gleams, And that for which my eyeballs long have strain'd Glares close within my grasp. UBALD. Away, wierd woman! I hold not parley with hell's messengers. WANDERER. Thou canst not leave me, save it be my will; A spell is on thee, Ubald! What fate bids, Thine arm must execute. The hour is ripe, The word is gone forth from the throne of judgment: The spirit of the deep has spoken it. Hark, Ubald, fear not! To thy bridal feast Bid the wierd wanderer.âDo I read contempt In thy keen eye? Ha! do these weeds offend thee? UBALD. Unearthly form, away! WANDERER. Impetuous youth! When thine heart swells with hope, I shall be near thee! Thou standest blind upon the fiery brink Of that deep gulph, which it were death to plunge in; But heaven shall succour and uphold thee, Ubald. Go forth in pride! go fearless! strike and conquer! UBALD. Mysterious prophetess! thy words are awful. WANDERER. More shalt thou know hereafter:âthis learn, Ubald, There is a fearful record in the heavens; Angels have written it; the dead bears witness. Sweno's whole heritage, this envied province, And that weak maid withal, were a poor barter For just revenge. [Exit WANDERER. UBALD, (alone.) Forbidden lore perchance And sight of visions not for man design'd Have crazed thee, beldame. Yet was I light before, And thou hast thrown a load on me. Thy features Have some strange power which thrills me.âThis rich province! Why ay; if Sweno's daughter be my bride, Who shall gainsay my claims?âHa! spoke she true? My name, my sire unknown; the rights, by nature Stamp'd on this brow, abolish'd quite and lost; No ancient crest this gorgeous helm adorning; Shall slaves call Ubald upstart? The blood cries, This must not be!âO, though unknown, revered! Father! how longingly my thoughts have yearn'd To know thy lineaments! If death has snatch'd thee From this our nether world, look down on me! For oft thy form has strode across my slumbers! If treason has foredone thee, and robb'd thy son Of his best heritage, thy spotless name, O speak to me, in night's still gloom reveal'd, Declare thy wrongs! Let Ubald fall, or wreak them! [Enter Reynald.] REYNALD. Thou art wrapt in thought. Men speak thee keen and lightsome, Not given to musing. UBALD. Each humor hath its hour. There is a blithe hour for the lip of love; The sparkling goblet, the bold clamor of battle Have theirs: there is an hour for deeper thoughts, When the soul soars alone beyond the clay That cramps its nature. Be thou welcome, Reynald; To-morrow must thine helmet bow before me; This night let us be cheery. REYNALD. Thou art boastful, Rash youth! Reynald is little wont to strive, Save with his equals. His sword strikes down the lofty, But spares the herd. UBALD, (laying his hand on his sword.) To me? to me this, Reynald? REYNALD. To whom it fits. Valor on lordly crests Sits like a jewel in the diadem, Giving and taking lustre. On the low It shines unseemly, like love's rosy chaplet On the bald front of age, and moves our pity. UBALD, (drawing his sword.) Thou hast said that which must be rued in blood. REYNALD. Not for thy worth, but that good gift of knighthood By princely Sweno's hand too largely lavish'd, I will e'en joust with thee to-morrow, Ubald. So thou shalt learn the weight of that tried arm Which Pagans shrink from. UBALD. By heaven, thou liest, to say 'Twas largely lavish'd! Thou darest not for thy life Brand me with lowly birth, though half my honors Lie in abeyance, and are meekly worn, Till it shall please high heaven to reveal My birthright. The pure blood throbs here more warmly, Caitif, than thine. REYNALD. That speech has seal'd thy doom; Thou shalt not live to view to-morrow's tourney. [They fight. Enters Sweno with his sword drawn.] SWENO. Forbear, Ubald, forbear! I charge thee, cease! Kind sir, (to Reynald) beseems it ill with such rude broils To scare our festive joys. Put up, good Ubald. I pray ye, sirs, on pain to lack our friendship, Pursue this wrath no further. Let not hate Lurk in these walls, to rear her deadly front Amidst our mirth. Pray ye, be friends. Who shivers One lance in wrath is banish'd from our tourney. UBALD. We shall have scope hereafter. Farewell, Reynald. [Exit Ubald. SWENO. Reynald, we should this eve be light and gladsome, But some unfriendly doom o'ertakes and thwarts us. [Exeunt. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. The Tournament. A Pavilion in front of the Area in which are the Lists. If it is not convenient to give a Representation of the Fight, the Scene must be so arranged that the Actors may appear to look down upon the Area in the back of the Stage which is out of the sight of the Audience. Sweno, Bertha, Agnes, and Attendants. SWENO. The eye of day looks cheerly on our meeting, And the bright bucklers of our helmed knights Send back his courtesy in gleams of fire. (flourish.) BERTHA. Who rides so proudly with yon cross of red? SWENO. 'Tis doughty Reynald, and that black devise Is the known emblem of illustrious Biorn. (flourish.) BERTHA. Mark how they charge! how lance and buckler crash! The red-cross wins: that sable crest is low. AGNES. O father, who is yonder giant champion, Whose lance seems weightier than a weaver's beam, He of the eagle-crest? SWENO. Harald of the Isles. A readier knight hath never buckled steel! And by my faith a noble wooer, Agnes. I knew not of his presence. This day's prize Hath drawn a sturdy suitor to the lists, And our best gallants quail. By heavens, I miss Their prompt alacrity: strong Harald rides Round the void lists as victor, undefied, And not a lance is couch'd.âSee! Shout without. Ubald! Ubald! SWENO. See, how young Ubald dares him to the proof! His lance is in the rest. (flourish.) On, on they rush, Like the swift whirlwind; they are lost in dust. By heaven, 'tis proudly done! (Agnes screams faintly, looking forward with eagerness.) Shout without. An Ubald! Ubald! SWENO. Why that huge champion of the misty isles Cumbers a rood of ground.âRight gallant Ubald! O daughter, thou hast lost a princely bridegroom, And his broad lands in Orkney. Much I marvel Who may withstand that dint which unhorsed Harald. BERTHA. Lo, where the red-cross gleams! SWENO. High-crested Reynald! If any strength can bide him, it is thine! (flourish.) BERTHA. What ails thee, child? Thy cheek is blanch'd with fear. Remember, Agnes, of what blood thou comest. SWENO. Lightning is not more sudden than their charge. Saint Mary! they bear them nobly, both unharm'd; The area shakes beneath them. See! they wheel, Like two big clouds careering in mid air. They clash again. O what a shock was there! The steeds are riderless upon their flanks, Shiver'd each lance. The sword must win the day. (The clash of swords is heard.) BERTHA. Now heaven defend thee, Ubald! thou hast need Of all thy prowess. AGNES. O his foot hath slipt! Eternal mercy, save him! SWENO. He is up, He bears him like a lion in the fight. His blows rain thick as hail. Shout without. Hurrah! hurrah! Ubald, brave Ubald is the victor! Ubald. (Agnes sinks half faint into the arms of Bertha.) SWENO. Our lion-cub has gain'd the day, and nobly. Shout without. Ubald! brave Ubald is the victor! Ubald! [Flourish. Enter UBALD, and other KNIGHTS.] [Enter UBALD, with his drawn sword in his left hand, and the broken sword of Reynald in his right.] UBALD. A boon, a boon, sir! Bid thy seneschal Cut heronshaw and peacock with this blade, This boasted dragon-carver from Aleppo! SWENO. Ubald, we greet thee with a parent's joy, The day is thine; but ere we make thee welcome As our child's suitor, whose abashed cheek Has changed fear's livery for a brighter color, Loud proclamation must the trumpet make, To all, whatever be their rank or station, Sounding our summons; so they may unfold The mystery of thy birth, which we deem noble. [Enter Reynald and others.] UBALD. Make proclamation for a leech, my sire! The conqueror of the east, the sultan-slayer, Has wrench'd his princely sinew. Faith 'tis well, Else Ubald had been minced by this rare blade, As trenchermen cleave larks. Say'st thou not, Reynald? REYNALD. False boy, thou didst take vantage of my mercy. 'Twas thy foot slipp'd; and, but I staid mine arm In pity to thy youth, thou wert not here To taunt me thus. Thou, when I thought thee shent, Didst, tygerlike, spring on me unawares, And that tried falchion snapp'd. UBALD. Aye, this strong weapon, To which the skulls of infidels were paper, Broke on the boy's arm. O 'twas foully play'd To deal the blows too fast upon thee, Reynald! I cry thee pardon. It behoved me wait Till Reynald had ta'en breath. 'Twas most discourteous; I should have waited on my bended knee Thine own good time. REYNALD. This is no feud of words; Thy way of mirth dishonoreth a name Which brooks no stain. By all the shades of those Who at life's cost have known me true and loyal, I do defy thee, Ubald, unto death. Earth is too narrow for thy spring of pride. UBALD. And the nine heavens, my spirit is so buoyant! Yet deem not, Ubald from thy manly brow Would pluck the wreath of reputation By such light speech. I do embrace thy challenge; But hark ye, Reynald, this morn to arms was given, Love claims to-morrow. SWENO. Sirs, these feuds offend us. Thou, Agnes, as befits thee, with yon cuirass, Palm of this trysting, gird victorious Ubald. Nay, by my knighthood, had I bid thee give Thyself, a worthier palm, thou couldst not change The clear complexion of thy natural hue To brighter vermeil. Agnes, on my troth I think thou fain wouldst give thy blushing self, The unsunn'd whiteness of this virgin hand, A brighter guerdon. (taking her hand, jestingly.) Have a care, young trembler! Perchance, at our citation, mailed Mars May claim him to his heaven. Have a care, daughter! (AGNES lifts up the golden cuirass to offer it to UBALD. At that moment the trumpet sounds again. Re-enters MESSENGER hurried.) SWENO. What tidings? MESSENGER. Noble Sweno, scarce the herald Had proclamation made, giving loud breath To the shrill trumpet's brass, when from the crowd Stepp'd forth a wizzard shape in female guise, Craving admittance to this lordly presence. (Flourish. Enter WANDERER, preceded by a Herald.) WANDERER. Sweno, I come, obedient to thy hest, Fate's secret to unravel, which disclosed, Egress unharm'd I claim for meâand mine. Than does the fretted gold wherein they lie, Like living lights in the fringed eyelids chased. UBALD. O treason! O base thief, thou hast purloin'd it! BERTHA. 'Tis like she hath; with sacrilegious hand Rifling the vault, where lie entomb'd the bones Of her who gave thee being. UBALD. 'Tis like?â'tis certain! SWENO. Say, woman, in that helpless infant's cradle What else was found, by no enquiring eye Save mine and noble Bertha's ever question'd? WANDERER. A scroll, whereon these words, in thy mind's tablet Long since deep graven.âRun not the couplets thus, Though the last words be from that legend rent? âThe secret piece from this indenture torn âWas sever'd at the hour this child was borne âFrom its proud mother; when they reunite, âThe valiant son shall meet his mother's sight.â And now I tender to thy judging eye, Long saved, long cased in gold with precious care, (taking it out of a small box) The fragment of that scroll.âSee, see!âit fits The nice indentures of that wavy rent, Which no art's skill could liken! See the words Traced by one hand, quaint nature's character! Comes that untainted scroll from the damp vault Of charnel-houses? Am I not thy mother? SWENO. O past conjecture wondrous! Name his father. WANDERER. He has no father! Ask the wandering billows Of the storm-beaten sea, who made their bosom Team with the finny myriads! Ask the winds, Who fill'd their darkling and invisible womb With blight and pestilence! He has no father. UBALD. Dread being! mother not, but fiend, I name thee! If true the accursed tale, thy child of want, Safe cradled in the arms of joy and honor, Why call'st thou now to misery and ruin? Why dash to earth the wreath, thine art had woven? Speak, foul witch, speak. WANDERER. Betray'd, out-cast, abandoned, Man's roof has not o'er-shelter'd me; the blast, Not age, has blanch'd these elf-locks. I have known Dire want and loneliest savage wanderings. The fearfullest glens, the tangled precipice, Have been my lair; the demon of the tempest My comforter: to sights abhorr'd of men And fellowship with every cavern's inmate Use has made me familiar; the gaunt wolf, The eagle, knows my coming and outgoing, And in compassion to man's outcast yields Share of his bloody banquet. Where I roam'd, The nightdew was my balm, the baleful clouds My canopy; and, by their sulphurous bolts Illumed, my rocky threshold gleam'd with splendor That did outshine the emblazon'd halls of kings. Nor envied I man's palaces.âBut such Was not fit cradle for weak infancy. The firm endurance of an injured soul May smile mid nature's terrors, and even hail The fiend that nurtures them; but helpless years Lack milder mother's-milk. SWENO. What phrensy then, Mysterious phantom, say, what hateful purpose Now, in the prime and summer of its growth, Strikes down that glorious scion, deck'd with honors, From this exalted station, where thy fraud Had safely planted it? WANDERER. Look upon me; Proud mortal, mark this gaunt and abject being; These skeleton-like limbs and sun-parch'd skin Which once had bloom and beauty!âSee me now The haggard child of want, and scorn, and wo! Whose hope is but despair! The very dogs Howl after me, as if the mouldering grave Had cast me from its foul abhorred womb Polluting with my breath the face of heaven. Sunk as I am, perchance amid the blaze Of yon gilt banners, girded with the pomp Of gorgeous chivalry, some bosom shrinks From inward horror, to whose nightly visions My lot were paradise. I would not change These tatter'd garments for your bravery.â Ubald, awake! If I have dash'd from thee This cup of joy, drugg'd deep with smiling mischief; If all the friends of thy proud-budding youth Drop off from thee, as from the wither'd tree The worms that fed on it; if glory's course Rejects thee, offspring of despair and want; Know, thou hast friends among the wrecks of nature. O there is joy amid the crashing storm, When the rack scuds before the rushing winds, And all is ruin! Where the sea-mew screams Mid desert caves may be thy nuptial bower; The howling wolves shall yield thee minstrelsy. Ha! ha! ha! (She laughs hideously). SWENO, (rising.) Out of my sight, accursed of heaven! away! WANDERER. (Withdrawing slowly, with a look and action of threatening and savage contempt.) The curse of heaven will be soon fulfill'd. [Exit. SWENO. Brave champions, this our joy is turn'd to sadness. Ubald, we still uphold thee; and thy deeds Shall win thee rank and reverence and honors: But such alliance suits not with our bearing; And we perforce must name, of those whose rank May make them bold to be our daughter's suitors, Reynald, though vanquish'd, victor.âWelcome, Reynald! Child of my heart, come with me. AGNES. Ubald! Ubald! (Exeunt all but UBALD, who remains alone in deep thought. The Scene falls in front representing a Woodland outside the Lists. UBALD enters slow and thoughtful, and leans on the point of his sword. He starts suddenly into a defensive attitude.) UBALD. Avaunt! spectre of hell, avaunt!âStay, Ubald! Thy brain is madden'd; thy stunn'd senses reel. (Starting again.) Who dared to call this wretched being Ubald? There was a time, I well remember me, When that name sounded in the lists of fame, Valor's first minion: 'twas a gallant name, And he who bore it, vail'd his crest to none, And men would doff their caps, and cry âLive Ubald!â 'Tis pastâit was a dreamâI am not Ubald! All, all's unsound! the very earth we tread on A counterfeit! a faithless sod, that mantles The bubbling of a bottomless abyss. Nature itself is false.âThere is no Ubald! He, who usurp'd that name's a slave, an upstart! A liar, a pitiful, a base-born slave! (A pause.) I have heard tell, that, when the unchaste moon Peeps with her broad eye glaring from above, Men's thoughts are phrensied: I do well believe, That we are drawn like puppets by her power Through fate's invisible and airy maze, Even as the tides of ocean ebb or swell At her strong bidding. Life's a mockery, And we, that tread this motley earth, are fools, And madmen. Else, amid the battle's hurley Why has this arm oft turn'd the flood of war, Outvying opposition, till the cry Of victory through all the welkin rang, Filling the trump of glory? if that name, Once bright like Lucifer, and like him lost, Falls as a star from heaven!âO Agnes, Agnes, What demon from my hand has dash'd the chalice, Which thou hadst crown'd with bliss!âHa! if thy faith Forswear me now,âbasebornâdespisedârejected. I will not, dare not think it.âJoy of my soul, I still have trust in thee! (He remains wrapt in thought, THE WANDERER enters unperceived.) WANDERER, (aside.) My son!âalas, In that brief word how many thoughts lie blended! O long divorced, estranged, from this lone heart, And yet my son!âI thought my soul was steel'd Against all fond impression, trebly arm'd With the keen temper of the merciless blade! And yet how painfully the name of son Falls on this wither'd heart!âO Ubald, Ubald, The cherub peace is waking in my soul, Which has not carol'd there since thou wert born! (Aloud.) My son! UBALD, (seizing her vehemently.) Call me not son!âO Satan's mate! By what foul spell hast thou atchieved my ruin? What traitor has suborn'd thee? Make thy treason As manifest as day, or I will tear Thy shrivell'd flesh, and cast it to the wolves. Hast thou not told a tale of damning falsehood? WANDERER. If I be Satan's mate, thy fury speaks thee Child of my womb. (He lets go his hold.) 'Tis meet that I, fate's tool, Should be accurst of mine own issue. Smite me, Fierce Ubald! Bury in eternal night The secret of thy birth! Slay her, who bore thee! UBALD. O terrible of women, I will kneel Even in prostration meekly to the hem Of thy rent garment, so thou wilt reveal The name of him whose stamp I bear. WANDERER. 'Twould need A raven's note to name him. Rather ask That fearful word, which, but once breathed aloud, Would have dissolv'd the fabric of this world And all the gorgeous firmament above us, Letting hell loose from its eternal chain. UBALD. And though the sky should reel, the rock-staid sea With the foundations of the crazy earth Quake to their base, I would demand it. WANDERER. Ubald, There stands between thee and thy burning wishes A wide gulph fixt, which to o'erleap were death. By all heaven's flaming lights thou art my child!â Wilt thou avenge me, Ubald?âThe event Hangs on my word, whether to uphold or plunge thee Deep, deep, into that fiery gulph of ruin. UBALD. My heart yearns painfully to know my father. WANDERER. Thou shalt learn nothing, till I am revenged! Rave, thou hot youth! Strike rashly, strike thy mother! Or kneel, and, Ubald, swear to slay the man Who made thee fatherless! I tell thee, son, If that thou hast an ear, a heart, a soul, That cry for vengeance, which appals me nightly, Must have been heard by thee. Swear, Ubald, swear! UBALD. There needs no oath to spur me to that goal, No, nor blind curse! By heaven, show me the man, That made an orphan of ill-fated Ubald, And I will drag him to such strict account, No second sun shall dawn on him and me. WANDERER. Swear it! UBALD. By all heaven's gifts I swear it!âName him. WANDERER. Sweno! proud Sweno made thee fatherless! Haste, Ubald! slay him!âWilt thou not avenge me? UBALD. The spirit of Satan dwells in thy foul lips! Thou darest not say it! WANDERER. Wilt thou not avenge me? UBALD, (with great emotion.) Say, who! and when, and where! how fell my father? WANDERER. Nay, not a word, till that dread debt be paid: Then shall my speech reveal no humble rights. Ubald, thine oath! Vengeance on haughty Sweno! UBALD. Mysterious Being, thy words fall like drops Of poison, blistering whate'er they touch. My soul is horror-struck. Shall Ubald slay One sire, kind substitute for nature's tie, At thy strange bidding, unreveal'd the tale Of his lost birthright, and unknown his father? WANDERER. Wilt thou not slay him? UBALD. By the living light, I will not touch his hoary brow with harm, For all that thou and thy fell crew can tempt with! WANDERER. O say not thusâ'twere better for thee, Ubald, To riot in the blood of innocents, To earn the mark of Cain, than bear the doom Which must o'erwhelm thee if thou brave this bidding. Stay! the ground quakes beneath thee! UBALD. Let it gape: I will not hurt the head of honor'd Sweno. WANDERER. Beware; his lot is seal'd; and thine hangs trembling In the eternal scale; whether to reap Thy glorious heritage, or wear a curse, Which but to whisper would make the horrent hair Bristle thy youthful brows. Wilt thou kill Sweno? UBALD. Not, though the firm earth yawn'd, and from its depth Fate own'd thy ministry. WANDERER. O fiends of vengeance, Sear up my milk of nature! Dry the source Of pity's womanish tears, or let them fall Like water on the hissing furnace cast, Giving new strength to all-devouring flame! Devoted Ubald, be fate's will atchieved, Though it must shiver thee! If vengeance move not, Love shall perforce arouse thee! Shall that Reynald To-morrow, triumphing in thy disgrace, Lead Agnes to the altar! Shall Ubald gape, And cry, âLong live the bride! Health and ripe joys âAttend their wedded couch!â Go, crave their alms, And beg some base coin from the lusty bridegroom! UBALD. The voice of fiends is in thee. O thy words Have rush'd like molten fire upon my soul! Thou canst not say that she will wed with Reynald. WANDERER. Will!ânay, she must.âIs not the faith of Sweno To Reynald pledged? or is that haughty chief In love a laggard? Know this, by thine abasement To-morrow Agnes is his bride, unless She be to-night thine, Ubald. UBALD. Ha! how say'st thou? WANDERER. This night or never must Agnes be thy wife. UBALD. To-night?âThey say the devil sometimes speaks true. WANDERER. (Giving him a key.) Take this, love's talisman. The wierd scorn'd Wanderer May crown thy wishes yet: its powerful spell Shall yield thee entrance to young Agnes' bower, When earth is wrapt in gloom. UBALD. Woman of might, Give to thy meaning words. If love prevail, Where and how wedded shall mine Agnes be At that still season? WANDERER. In Helen's ruin'd chapel. When first the moon upon your secret flight Throws her slant beam, beneath the porch a priest Shall wait thy bidding.âSpeed! arouse her love! Triumph o'er maidish dread! or the next sun Must dawn on Reynald's bliss. UBALD. On Reynald's death, Or shall see Agnes mine. WANDERER. Under that chapel A secret cell is hewn; that obscure vault Shall be thy bridal chamber.âFear'st thou, Ubald? Splendor it lacks, and soft luxurious ease, To cheer a dainty fair one; but its stillness Is fitting such a stealth. This night or never! Ubald, time flies. UBALD. Befriend me, powerful Love! My thoughts are all amazed and unarray'd, I walk as in a mist; be this night, Agnes, Our first fond entrance into weal or wo! [Exit UBALD. THE WANDERER, (alone.) He's gone; he's gone.âBe still, thou coward heart! I know not whether I am dead or waking. The world seems dark around me, and such deeds Are doing, that the sun must shrink for ever. Methought I heard the voice of one, who drowning Cried, âmother, save me! help me, ere I sink!â And then methought two spirits strongly strove To drag me diversely; one pure as light, The beam of radiant mercy on its brow; The other foul and loathsome, fierce as death, Mocking the agony of convulsive sobs, And its fell strength prevail'd. O powers of evil, There be some hallow'd moments, when this soul Can wrestle with your might, and dovelike peace Seems like a lovely vision, seen far off! Now all is dark: the Spirit of revenge Knocks, Sweno, at thy gate. Thy knell is rung. [Exit. Scene III. âSweno's Hall. SWENO, REYNALD and others. SWENO. We do admit thy claims, but some short space Crave ere the accomplishment. A troublous star Lowers o'er our house: we lack the pulse of joy For bridal revels.âI fear my child had framed Some hopes which must prove vain; but Sweno's daughter Will know what fits her station. [Enter Attendant.] Attendant. Ubald craves Admittance. SWENO. By your leave. (Reynald and others fall back to the further end of the stage.) SWENO, (alone.) Wo to who rears The tyger's young! and yet I love thee, Ubald. [Enters Ubald.] Be welcome, Ubald! Sweno's hall is open To all his knights; to none, than thee, more freely. UBALD. There was a time, nor is it long by-goneâ An hour or two perchanceâwhen Sweno's hall Was open to his sonâhis foster'd son, Who, from life's earliest dawn to manhood, knew No other sire;ânor now.âDost thou disclaim me? SWENO. Would that thou wert my son! Brave youth, this heart Would leap to see my crest and gallant bearings With all the honors that my house has earn'd Worn by mine issue. 'Tis the curse of fate A stranger shall gird Sweno's sword, a stranger Lord o'er this princely fief, when I depart, The last male of my race. I would give half My wealth thou wert my son. UBALD. It hath pleased God To shrowd the fountain of my birth, perchance For some unpurged offence. And yet methinks, If there be one upon this lower earth To whom it stands reveal'd, that should be Sweno. SWENO. Ha! how say'st thou? UBALD. I say, it should be Sweno. Why didst thou rear me as thy child, if baseborn? The lion brings not to his tawny mate The jackall's cub. O Sweno, I adjure thee By the one hope I harbor this side heaven, Unveil my secret birth. SWENO. Am I a prophet, Ubald? Hath not this morn too much reveal'd Of thy sad story? UBALD. Nothing! I stand alone, Sever'd from every tie, but such as bind me To thee and thine. My birth is wrapt in gloom Thick as the inaccessible cloud, which hides The shrine upon the peak of Caucasus. SWENO. Ubald, when first I saw thee, thou wert smiling, A helpless infant, upon Bertha's bosom. The fearless smile craved pity. From that hour (For we esteem'd thee sprung of gentle stock) Thou hast lack'd nothing, which a parent's fondness Could lavish on the heir of all his fortunes. Like a king's issue hast thou been upbrought With every princely gift; and last, not lightest, The boon of knighthood. UBALD. Sir, that debt is written Here with indelible characters, and claims The service of this arm till death. SWENO. O Ubald, I have e'en loved thee like an anxious father; And thou hast fill'd that void in my affections Which nature left, denying me a son. Now haply it behooves me cast thee from me Adown the vale of life, seeing (though late) That thou hast clomb unto this lofty nest From such a lowly and disgracious fortune. But still I love thee, and will uphold thy knighthood At no mean cost; but higher hopes are wreck'd By thy base origin. UBALD. O thou dost not, canst not, Believe it, Sweno!âIt is false as hell; The tongue that did avouch it is accurst. SWENO. Ubald, intemperate wrath does ill become Thy present station. Be of humbler strain! We are to blame, who have uprear'd thy youth In boisterous license. Think, what now befits thee. UBALD. It fits me, sir, to guard with jealous honor The rights you gave me; nor will I renounce Of those one smallest title, while I gird This sword of knighthood, which departs not from me, Save in the grasp of death. Were my race abject, As the blood cries within me it is noble, I have earn'd that, in perilous fields of fame, Which doth outshine the best and loftiest birthdom, A soldier's rank. Upon thy pledged word I claim my prize, the hand of Agnes.âStart not, 'Tis truth; there lives not in this realm of Jutland Who can deny my right. SWENO. IâSwenoâtell thee, I, I, would plunge this sword, my father's weapon, Like he of Rome, into my daughter's bosom, Abolishing with her each joy of age, Ere she should soil by such a foul alliance The blood of my fore-elders. UBALD. It is false; It were no stain to wed with Ubald. Hark ye, Sirâfearless I assertâmark well my wordsâ Thou canst not, durst not, Sweno, for thine honor, Uphold that wizzard's tale. SWENO. Nay, by my sword, Her proofs admit not doubt or question. UBALD. O monstrous! By that selfsame speech convicted, Thou wert a murderer. Ay, start now, and learn What 'tis to have the jewel of thy life Hang on a traitor's proof! SWENO. Boy, thou art frantic. UBALD. By heaven, I am calm; I speak the things I know, And I embrace with juster apprehension Their form and bearings, than thou dost. Take me with thee, I do not charge on thee that damning guilt; Here I discard the thought, as loathsome treason Gender'd in hell. But, if her speech were true, Thine hate has robb'd me of a princely father. She speaksânot I.âHer voice cries loud for vengeance. Thou canst not heap her tale upon my head, And not take home to thine that charge of murder. SWENO. What ho! (Reynald, &amp;c. come forward.) Sirs, we are bearded in our hall; The whelp, which we have nurtured, turns upon us With rabid fang. Thus from our love we cast him! Base-born, away! we brook not thy rash words. UBALD, (drawing his sword.) Say'st thou? And yet I have no sire but thee. No other tongue had scorn'd me thus, and lived! No other eye upon my fallen fortunes Had glared, as thine does now! I will not harm thee. Thou, Reynald, thou whose bold pretensions Assail my rights, stand forth. Let heaven decide Which be the better and the nobler champion. Thou didst erewhile defy me unto death. REYNALD. I did; and thy bold arm eschew'd the cartel Even in the shelter of a woman's bower. That arm perhaps is abject as thy birth. UBALD, (fighting.) Thusâthusâwe shall be quickly weigh'd. SWENO, (interposing.) Stand back! I do forbid the challenge. Lay hands on him. (The Knights interpose with drawn swords.) We have been far too mild; but Sweno's presence Shall not be braved. Our will is thus determined; To-morrow, Reynald, thou shalt wed our daughter. But if thou wieldest sword or lance before, We cast thee from our love. (To UBALD.) Thou, sir, begone. We would not willingly let thee down the wind, But thou, unruly tarsel, quitt'st thy perch To strike too high a quarry. Lead him forth. UBALD. Which is the vassal will lay hands on Ubald?â I quit thee, Sweno.âThou hast done me wrong, Which haply should wipe out the memory Of all I owe thee:âbut it is not so. Thou, haughty Reynald, mark me. It were safer To take the fleshless and abhorred death To be thy mate, than lay the hand of power Upon mine Agnes. [Exit. REYNALD. Faith, thou bear'st thee nobly; And I could prize thee rather in its ebb, Than brook the rash flow of thy better fortune. SWENO. We do desire the Lady Agnes' presence. [Exit Attendant. Reynald, I am much moved. This headstrong youth Has part in my affections, and my daughter Regards his worth too highly: if she bewail him, We must be brief, and use authority, Though it sound harsh. (Enters AGNES.) (SWENO, embracing her.) My child! AGNES. My gracious sire! SWENO. Thou art pale, and yet, believe me, child, I love thee As my best hope on earth.âSaid I my best? My only hope! AGNES. Ever my own kind father! SWENO. I have no son. A son is to his father A mirror, in the which his aged eyes May read their image; ay, a magic mirror, Which doth give back himself, his form and likeness, Even in the pride and semblance of his youth!â Thou would'st speak, but the inarticulate sound Dies on thy lips. AGNES. SirâSomething I would say, But it might savor of presumptuous wishes To think a worthless maiden could reflect Ought of her father's virtues, in whom the mould Of nature's noblest pattern is most perfect: Yet gazing on them, living in the shine Of all thy glories, something my thoughts must borrow From thine high attributes; and store it here As the pale ineffectual orb of night Drinks the sun's lustre. SWENO. I do esteem thee, Agnes, Worthy thy blood; one in whom gentle pleasance With loftier thoughts is wedded; born to grace Thy noble lord and rear his princely issue To wear our dignities. AGNES. Sir? SWENO. We lack an heir To bear them worthily. Behold the Knight Whose unmatch'd prowess we have this day chosen, To uphold our race. Thou art a bride to-morrow. AGNES. Say not unmatch'dâO, sir, you are too hasty. (Kneeling.) Pray you, recall that speech! 'Twas but yestre'en You said, my lord must stand in arms unrivall'd; I do take sanctuary on those thy words, The altar of thy truth. SWENO. And so he does. AGNES. O father, I address me to your justice! I will not plead, as other maids are used, The dreamings of the fancy. I adjure thee By thine own blood which throbs within this heart, Do not that wrong! for Ubald is the victor. And if that strange tale (false perchance) have thrown A shade upon his fortunes, and ta'en from him The sunshine of thy favor, let me bide E'en as I am, thine own, thy loving handmaid! Or if that be too blessed, and his fall Must marr my joys and cast me forth from thee, O let me in some barren cloister chew The bread of solitude, but do not curse me With such worse thraldom! SWENO. Daughter, thou offendest. Thou sinn'st against thy name. I bid thee purge The avenues of thy thoughts, and from that bosom Pluck the foul image which is nurtured there With all its baseness. Gods! shall Sweno's child Stoop to a beggar's wooing?âLeave my cloak. AGNES. Say not to-morrow, father! SWENO. Loose me! rise! The valiant Reynald has my word. Receive him, As fits thee, courteously. (Going, while she stretches her arms to follow him.) I bid thee stay. [Exit SWENO, &amp;c. Manent AGNES, REYNALD. AGNES. My father!âHe has left me.âNow, good angels, Arm me with strength. I will embrace my shroud Ere I prove faithless. REYNALD. This hand, midst war's alarums, Has purchased honor in the hazardous field At my life's hourly venture; but the frown Of lovely woman I am ill wont to strive with. AGNES. There is no strife between us, sir.âWhat mean you? I wear my temper evenly, as fits The daughter of a prince; if thou hast cause Of strife, declare it. REYNALD. No cause, fair Agnes, Saving such war, as oft-times is the herald Of gentle love. Permit . . . . (He offers to take her hand.) AGNES. Touch me not, sir! I may not brook thy freedom. REYNALD. On my knee . . . AGNES. Go to, go to; I take no fallen champion, No knight whose sword is broken. I commend you Unto that Syrian princess whom you rescued! You soar too high. REYNALD. Ha! Dost thou scorn me, lady? AGNES. Hast thou ne'er heard, how they of heathendom Stood back in awe, before the livid corse Which to their gods was consecrate by lightning? E'en such am I; amid the joys of youth Struck by the angry bolt of heaven, and will Henceforth hold fellowship with nothing earthly. I do embrace the altar, and will rather Wear out my years in solitary penance Than wed with thee. [Exit. REYNALD. 'Tis strange; this baseborn churl Spreads an infectious rashness. Scornful maid, This may be rued; for thou perforce art mine In all thy flood of beauty, and must bend. This splendid heritage outweighs thy love. [Exit. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. THE WANDERER, (alone.) That thou dost love the maid suits well my purpose; It is the helm which guides thee to that port Where vengeance calls; but think not thou shalt take That viper to thy bed, the child of Sweno! Lost as I am, and stamp'd by nature's curse, Thou art my son; and sooner would I wring The life blood from this heart, than see thee batten On that abhorred couch. Once have I stood Between thee and that leap, when fate seem'd fixt, And thou already in thine ardent hopes Forejoyd'st her charms. Once more I will arrest thee, Ere Agnes be thy wife; or, if thou wedd'st, Thou shalt embrace a corse.âThis is fate's seal, (producing a phial.) Love's antidote. This philtre from thine hand Shall lull her maidish fears in that sound sleep Which knows no waking. [Enter UBALD.] UBALD. Woman, still thou meet'st me At each turn like my evil destiny. What wilt thou? WANDERER. Aid thee. UBALD. I would be alone. The blood is stirr'd within me, and thy sight Offends my thoughts. WANDERER. Hast thou seen Agnes? UBALD. Seen her! In the broad face of day I have required her, My prize, my right. Great gods! I have been scorn'd, Trampled by Sweno's pride. WANDERER. 'Tis well.âThe curse Will soon o'ertake him. Thou seek Agnes' chamber; The shades of evening thicken, and the sounds Of clamorous revelry are sunk in silence; It is the hour of love. UBALD. Speak not of love; I feel a strange and preternatural awe Thrill through me in thy presence. Leave me, woman. WANDERER. Yet will I aid thee, Ubald. Take this phial, A potent philtre, brew'd with secret spells When the moon's face was full: in man 'twould breed Aversion, fear, or death; but, given to woman, Its powerful charm will so enthrall her will Led by its strong invisible influence, That she must bend to him who ministers. Give this, and she is won. UBALD, (taking it). I have e'en heard That such things are, and of portentous might. Thou rosy draught, in which the loves sit smiling, No sea-tost mariner ere hail'd the land With its fresh dawn of verdure, no sick mourner The beam of health, with such heart-stirring joy As the scorn'd lover, vex'd with hopeless wishes, Would bless thy perfidy! O most subtle thief, Canst thou with witching and seductive skill From the closed issues of the pitiless mind Draw sweet accordance, moulding the stern thoughts Even to the form and quality of fondness? WANDERER. The virtue is in the proof. Present that philtre, And thou shalt find the gently kindled heart Turn quick and tremulously to thy bidding, As doth the magnet to its proper pole. UBALD. These toys are for the humble;âsuch as crawl Content to owe their summer-growth of fortune To paltry plotting and mean artifice. Woman, I scorn thy gifts. (He dashes it on the ground.) When Ubald takes The kiss of love, or unbought wreath of honor By a wizzard's trick, fall from him, gracious Heaven! To others thy curst wares! my hopes need no Unhallow'd aid. WANDERER. Mad boy, thou art undone! The fruit, when thou hast press'd its precious savor, Shall turn to bane: the venomous rind cling to thee Loathsome, destroying life. Still take my counsel, Ere fate shall close her adamantine gate Thro' which there is no return. UBALD. I will not, sorceress. Thine indirect and artful policy Suits not my bearing.âCome, thou holy parent, First source of love, with unadulterate speech Inform my tongue, and show the guileless spell Of thine own eloquence, resistless Nature!â Bid thy priest wait me under Helen's porch. Thus far I use thee. [Exit. THE WANDERER, (alone.) O fell Destiny, With what prevailing and tremendous power Thou goad'st me to the goal! Thy tread is like The rush of many waters, indistinct But dreadful, coming louder on the ear And big with ruin. I am borne on by fate And that relentless never-ceasing voice Which swells within me to the utterance, My mother's cry. It is here, here, here, rising (She touches her forehead) As the low murmur from the hollow earth Which bodes the hurricane.âSee there! See there! She stands; she beckonsâSee! she glares upon me, As in the frantic moments of her death. There was none near her in that agony, But the lost wretch who drew perdition on her. Away, away, this is no time for thought. [Exit. Scene II. The Garden before the Door of Agnes' Chamber. Dusk. UBALD. Once more, loved shades, I tread your fragrant lawn, Scene of my earliest joys! not, as before, Elate and joyous; but, like night's marauder, I steal unto the plunder of those joys Day will not yield me. I am ill used to deeds That shun the light; my firm nerve quakes and trembles, Which never blench'd before. Strange thoughts assail me. With what a plain and level course till now My barque has steer'd through this world's stormy ocean, Breasting its turbulent wave as if in triumph! Now is my course obscured, and tempest-tost I roam amid the billows. In thee, Agnes, Life's only sunshine dwells: joy, fame, and glory, Are but the rays of one revolving circle, In which thy cherish'd form is fixt and center'd.â No voice.âThe sounds of mirth have ceased within, And no lights flit along those arched casements. Now to love's work! Be still, thou murky air, And shroud with thy soft veil the theft I purpose! (Holding out the key and unlocking the door.) O thou quaint minister to daring love, Do thy kind secret office, and unlock This shrine of chastity!âHush!âAgnes! Agnes! 'Tis Ubald's voice that steals upon thy slumber. AGNES, (coming out fearfully.) What means my Ubald? At this hour! alone! How couldst thou break the privacy of my chamber? I dare not speak with thee. UBALD. Nay, nay, Agnes, Time yields no season now for doubt or scruples. I would not trench, no not by one small atom, Upon that reverence my love should yield thee; But, while we speak, e'en now wing'd moments fly, To wrest thee from mine arms for ever. Agnes, I have not built my love upon the sand? Thy faith will not fall from me? AGNES. Sooner, Ubald, This timid heart would brave the oppressor's sword, Than fall from thee; but steal not like a thief Upon the night; I dare not greet thee freely, My life, my lord. UBALD. If Ubald is thy life, Thou must be his, and this night, lovely trembler. AGNES. O Ubald, thou art wild to say to-night. UBALD. I am not wild: and yet I am wild, Agnes, To think that life's whole joy is on the cast Of this swift hour. AGNES. This hour! UBALD. Thou darest not bide Till the morn break, and with insulting joy Reynald shall come to tear thee to the altar! AGNES. O never, Ubald! by our loves I swear Sooner to die, than wrong thee! UBALD. Oaths are vain. Hands even now are plying, chaplets woven, To deck thee for to-morrow's sacrifice; Sweno has vow'd it. Agnes, thou art mine This night, or blood must stream upon thy bridal. AGNES. Merciful heaven! what dost thou meditate? O Ubald, smite not in thy wrath! UBALD. 'Tis thou, Thy cold delay, which goads me to such phrensy. Say, dearest, thou wilt be my bride to-night. The priest awaits; thy Ubald kneels to thee. AGNES. Ubald, thou wrong'st the chaster thoughts of duty, Which dare not yield what the weak heart would grant. I must not hear thee; but the trembling soul Bleeds to say nay. I may not fly my father. UBALD. Then bide, O false one, and be Reynald's victim!â And yet thou darest not wed him!âAgnes, Agnes, Thou couldst not yield this hand, thine Ubald's treasure, And look upon the sun, that lit thy treason. AGNES. Indeed I durst not. UBALD. Agnes, this hand is pledged To me and to my fortunes; it was given In the fair prime and sunshine of our loves, Which must abide through every change of season, Not worn as summer garments, to be cast When ruder hours assail us. Here I hold it Before the face of heaven, and those pure orbs Which heard the pledge. I will not loose this hand, Till at the altar vows assure thee mine, Though it were parricide to hold it, Agnes. Thy sire will come! Despair hath wrought me mad. (Kneeling, and clasping her hand passionately.) Say thou wilt be my bride! Have mercy, Agnes! Blood will be spilt ere morn, if thou deniest me. AGNES. O Ubald, I am riven by love and duty. Would that I durst! UBALD. O yield thee to my faith! To say me nay, is to say nay for ever. Agnes, to-night or never we must wed. AGNES. O Ubald, do not tempt me to a deed, Which shall embitter all our after-joys. Heaven will not smile on disobedient vows. My sire will curse us. Spare me, beloved Ubald! I have not strength to strive against thy wrath. UBALD. The priest attends us, love. The solemn rites, That make thee mine, shall steep thy thoughts in peace. AGNES. Dear Ubald, peace can never crown the guilty. I am too weak, too deeply pledged in love, To hold that proud demeanor, which I owe To my own name and to my noble father. But do not cozen me with empty hopes! Guilt may have some brief pleasures, great though anxious; But peace dwells only in the path of duty. Make me not, Ubald, what thyself will scorn, An outcast child! UBALD. Would Ubald cause thee sorrow? In infant years, whene'er thy heart was sad, And I had been but one day absent, thou Wouldst rush into mine arms and there pour forth Thy gentle sorrows, and they straight would vanish. And wouldst thou place a bottomless gulph between us? Thou wilt not tear thee from me? Night is waning, Come, best beloved! AGNES, (yielding.) I am too weak. (Stopping again.) Hark, Ubald! There is an angry whisper of the air, The shivering trees do rustle with each other. O tempt me not to ruin, loved, loved Ubald! Let me once see my sire, and press his knees With burning tears, that he may spare his child! UBALD. Agnes, the word of knighthood duly given Is law to Sweno. There is now no hope Save in our instant union. Footsteps move Through yon dark corridor. Come friend or foe, Ubald will not resign thee but in death. Yield, love; despair and death are in delay. AGNES. (She leans upon him with a burst of tears.) Ubald, I yield me; but my bosom shrinks With ominous terrors. UBALD. Fear not! Come, dear bride. [Exeunt. Scene III. Before the Porch of Helen's Chapel. Night. THE WANDERER, (alone.) Stay, moon, thy rising! When thy conscious eye Shall pierce the curtain'd east, fate's bolt must fall, Blurring thy beams with blood. O I am faint, And gladly would I lay this fever'd head On the cold ground, and lull my thoughts in death. The memories of years rise ghastly round me, And the soul sickens with the sad review Of all my wanderings. At such an hour (I mind it now, although the mist hangs often O'er my benighted mind) those treacherous joys, That trembled in it like a beam from heaven, Stole to my heart, foreshowing bliss and rapture; But, tasted, turn'd heaven to hell, and made this earth A howling wilderness. O lost delight! Time was, that I was fair, and blithe, and lovely: My heart expanded to the God of nature, And every morning, in my humble bower Of woodbine and wild sweets, I pour'd my strain, Sweet orisons of praise, to him who bless'd me. Visions of innocence, where are ye fled? My brain is like a furnace, and the fiend Goads me to ruin:âyet I dare not waver Now, on the dizzy gulph of that toss'd ocean Upon whose brink I stand. But this my cup Of vengeance will I drink, and then, lost mother, Thy spirit shall have peace! Blind chaos, come! O Ubald, O my son! thou art the shaft Twenty long winters in fate's quiver stored, And whetted by revenge. I must be brief; I have upheld thee once; again the pit Yawns close beneath thy feet, and I have digg'd it. The hour draws nigh. Yet have I one strong spell To ward thy ruin, and thou perforce shalt venge me. [Exit. (Enter UBALD and AGNES.) AGNES. Stay, best beloved! I heard a voice, dear Ubald; This place is awful. Let me yet return. UBALD. Mine Agnes, cheer thy heart: this loneliness Is fitting tender thoughts. AGNES. Too strongly loved! My father's curse will blast me. I shall hang Even as a wither'd wreath upon thy neck, And thy quick temper will upbraid my sadness. Perchance thy love, my only prop, will leave me. Wilt thou not hate my tears? UBALD. In mirth or sorrow, Ever my own! I will make tears my drink, Ambrosial sighs my food. The very gods Shall envy me.âOur harbinger of bliss Peers through her misty shroud. (The moon rises.) So radiant love, Smiling through tears, shall light mine Agnes' brow. AGNES, (clinging close to UBALD.) Ubald, who comes? [Enter Monk.] UBALD. A friend! our trustiest friend, Whose blessing, gentle maid, shall seal our union. Welcome, kind father! These still rocks are lonely; No eye shall break upon our privacy, Save yon pure orb, our hymeneal lamp, That smiles upon us. Though our modest bridal Must shun the glare of pompous blazonry, We make thee almoner of this our largesse. 'Tis fit that gifts should crown the church's rites, And charity draw down a blessing on them. (Giving him a purse.) MONK. 'Tis fitting, noble youth: and Father Francis Hath a right trusty hand, and knows full well Where to apply this cordial; what souls need The cheering comfort of thine alms, and where 'Twere cast away, like jewels unto swine. (aside.) By our mass, a goodly gift, and well bestow'd! UBALD. We are the debtors to your kindness, Father, And shall not stint our gifts. Bear'st thou the key Of this lone chapel, through whose color'd pane The moonlight gleams on the neglected altar, And chides us for delay? MONK. When doth the woodman Forget his ax, or the true knight his falchion? And think'st thou Father Francis doth not bear The weapons of his ministry? This key Unfolds the portal of that massive arch Into the shrine; this, at love's witching mandate, Shall ope the cell beneath it, where is strewn The bridal couch. AGNES. Ubald, I am dismay'd; The very rocks and chapel frown on us: The shrine of God looks awful in this gloom, And my heart's pulse is chill'd. Thou wilt not guide me Into the bowels of that ruinous den, Where fiends perchance abide? MONK. In truth, fair lady, Rife is the rumor that these cells are held By restless spirits, far from human tread; But trust me, they are jovial souls that haunt them. I have known somewhat of their pranks myself. But fear not, lady; spectres come not nigh This glen to-night, for I have exorcised it. Nor flesh, nor spirit walks within these doors Without my leave. Come, lady, to the chapel. UBALD. Lean on me, loveliest burthen! Let this arm Be now, as ever, the sole prop of Agnes. Thou wilt not fear while Ubald is beside thee. AGNES. Forgive me, Ubald, that each breath appalls me: My fluttering heart beats quick with guilty terror; I dread this very darkness which befriends us, The fitful breathing air, and these lone walls, Lest the mute stones should find a voice to curse me [The Monk, who has unlocked the chapel door, pushes it open, after some delay and exertion, with a hoarse grating noise.] AGNES shrieks, and draws back. O Ubald, let us turn! Nature forewarns us; As cautiously we cross'd the forest glen, Beneath each rustling leaf a tongue seem'd lurking; And now from out these walls, this ruin'd shrine, Night's ominous bird will scream and flap his wing Over our bridal. Turn we, dearest Ubald! My father will relent. UBALD. Gods! am I mock'd? Shall Ubald be the jest of every slave? E'en at the altar's groundsill yield my right, And see insulting Reynald swoop my bride In his curst talons? Sooner Chaos come! By heaven, it is not well, it is not well, To stir my blood thus, Agnes! AGNES. Be not angry! Let not thy wrath destroy me quite with anguish! What prop, what hope hath Agnes, but thy kindness? Beloved, forgive my weakness: I am thine; But, O! what harbor hath the guilty child, If thou too chide her? UBALD. It is tempting fate To dally thus with time. Pursuit may reach us. By all the honors I have earn'd and proudly, I turn not living hence, till thou art mine! MONK. I like not this mine office. If the maiden Decline the church's rite, I take my leave. UBALD, (stepping before him.) Not so, Sir Priest; stay yet! it were not safe To rouse the wrath of Ubald. Agnes, Agnes, Assure this Father of thy free consent! The sacred gate stands open. (Taking her hand: she leans upon him.) Thus, beloved! Lean thus upon my neck, O thus for ever! AGNES. I have not strength to tell my Ubald nay. [She enters the Chapel, supported by Ubald, and followed by the Monk.] END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. Night. Before Sweno's Window. The Wanderer alone enters cautiously. SWENO 's voice within. Bertha! WANDERER. His voice! his voice! O tones once dear, With what dread tremor fall ye on my heart! O that the space of unrecorded time, Which has crept slowly, withering hope and life, Could be annihilate; and days, long sunk In its devouring gulph, rise fresh and fair! O Sweno, Sweno, that my soul was chaste Thy conscience knows; that I was mild and gentle The cursed triumph of thy fraud bears witness! That I am hideous now as hell's own inmates, Blotted from honor's book, disgraced, abandon'd, That is thy work, thy foul and damning deed. A stranger sits upon my rightful seat, The bright throne of my hopes; and here I wander, Given to the pitying tempests, cast in hate Forth from my lawful bed, to be the scorn Of things that howl; while thou, adulterous lord, Smilest o'er my wreck. The hour of wrath is come, The plague is o'er thine house. O heavy sleep, Weigh down the brow of Sweno! seal his lids In silence, whose next sleep is in the grave! Sweno, Sweno, I summon thee to death! [Exit. Scene II. Sweno's Chamber. SWENO. BERTHA. BERTHA. The evening is far spent, and drowsy night Spreads her still mantle o'er the face of nature. Sweno, thy mind needs rest. SWENO. O gentle Bertha, The limbs may lack refreshment, but the mind Hath no sweet pause, while shapeless dread hangs o'er it, E'en in the lap of sleep. That strange wierd woman Has cast a withering spell upon my soul, And her last words ring dreadful in mine ear. O Bertha! I am sick at heart, and cheerless; The memory of the past preys keen and darkling On my deep-burthen'd soul. The curse of her, Who bann'd us, still pursues me. BERTHA. What means my lord? Have not his firm asseverations made His Bertha certain, that her wondrous form, Beauteous in madness, was unknown to Sweno? SWENO. And be that added to the bitter sum; Bertha, my speech deceived thee. Not unknown Her voice, like fate's last summons, smote my soul. Still when the tempests rave, and sheeted lightning Sets the pale vision of her form before me, That sound appalls my fancy; from above Retributory vengeance frowns on Sweno. BERTHA. Be my lord's thought less gloomy! Twenty years The sun hath smil'd on us, and all things prosper'd, As if kind fortune's course outsped thy wishes. SWENO. Ay, my loved wife: but heaven's deep wrath delay'd O'erwhelms with tenfold vengeance. BERTHA. Nay, good Sweno, Heaven has still joys in store to cheer the evening Of thy bright glories: thou unbend thy sorrows, Disclose the bitter secret of thy thoughts, And let my love assuage them. SWENO. Gentle Bertha! From my youth up I have been proud and fearless. Bitter must be the pangs which now can wring Self-accusation from the mouth of Sweno. But it shall be. Pride wrought the deed that stains The fair field of my conscience, which yet knows No other blot: and that dark pride shall stoop Even to confession of my inward horrors. I will be henceforth humble, very humble. BERTHA. Speak, and be yet my proud and glorious husband! The evil now abjured, whate'er it be, Humiliates not. SWENO. Was she not fair? BERTHA. O yes; I well remember, on the raving blast, When her locks stream'd (her beauteous form between us And the fire-flashing storm) I could almost Have bow'd and worshipp'd: but the ban, that flow'd From her ill-ominous lips in phrensy, spoke her A maniac or a fiendlike spirit, and say'st thou Not then unknown? SWENO. O Bertha! she was known Even to the inmost chamber of my heart. There was a time, if she had ask'd of Sweno Wealth, fortune, station, character, whate'er Makes man amongst his fellows vain or glorious, I had all given and freely; so enshrined Was her bright image in my soul: e'en now My fancy views her innocent and lovely, The temple of pure joys, as first I saw her Staunching my wounds, while I lay faint and bloodless. BERTHA. What wounds? when, where inflicted? say, kind Sweno. SWENO. 'Twas dusk; alone I journey'd through the forest, Where the trees leaning from the ruinous steep Spread their rude canopy o'er a mountain brook, Then dry and stony. Crossing the ravine, A bow-shot slew my steed; loud rose the shout Of rushing men unmerciful. I staid My back against a rock and kept at bay The yelling ruffians, when a hand unseen From the crag's summit smote me, and I fell Senseless and seeming dead into the hollow. BERTHA. Ah me! and none to help? SWENO. Yes, there was one, A shape like heaven's pure spirits, to whom I owe Life rescued from that deep and bloody trance. BERTHA. How came she in that glen? SWENO. A cottage, mantled With flowery sweets, on the lone forest's border, Gave birth and nurture to her loveliness. Widow'd, forlorn, though sprung of gentle blood, Her mother had no joy, no hope, but her; Yet in that rich indeed. Passing the glen At earliest dawn to seek their scanty herd, She found me thus. BERTHA. And saved thee! That poor maniac, Sweno, thy life's preserver! Is it thus? SWENO. I tell thee, Bertha, if the slave, that fell'd me, Had thrust his weapon to the seat of life, I had died then reproachless, nor thus stoop'd To strew the ashes of too late repentance O'er my devoted head. From that long trance I woke, as by an angel's touch redeem'd. I had seen nothing on this goodly earth Like her who stood beside me. Her bright hue, Her shape, her charms, were in the spring of youth, With every full-form'd loveliness new-blown; Of such superior and exalted grace As woo'd the sense to worship: her dark eyes Shone with no earthly lustre, proud, yet bashful; And their glance seem'd to say, âLove me, for I âAm worth the loving, and can well repay âWith the best bliss of life.â BERTHA. But thy keen wounds, How were they staunch'd? SWENO. There, where I carried phrensy, Disgrace, and death! By beauty nursed I wax'd In health and vigor, while the mind's deadlier fever Waked hot within. But Elfrid's soul was haughty, And, when to lawless passion I gave voice, The flush of indignation crimson'd o'er Those beauteous cheeks, where love sate still supreme; And those dark eyes, which seem'd his throne and altar, Became a killing plague. Stung with desire, Maddening, I swore, if she would bless my love, That she should share my name, rank, wealth and honors. My oaths prevail'd. O Bertha! I did call The living God to witness with such strong And terrible denouncement, that my soul Shrinks now from the remembrance. I invoked A curse on me and mine to everlasting, If I should fail. BERTHA. Immortal justice, spare us! SWENO. Heaven bears record, how I adored and wrong'd her; How in brief space those vows, joy-seal'd, were broken. Health strung my limbs; the prize from thy fair hand 'Mid Christendom's best knights in tourney won Waked loftier thoughts. Pride scorn'd the lowly gem Which it had robb'd of lustre. Yet once more I saw her, mournful, and presaging death, In her lone bower. I spoke not what I purposed, But her pale features an expression wore So sad, and yet so steadfast, that her look Pierced to my inmost soul, which shrunk beneath it. Her words were few; but from a harp, o'er which Oft I had hung in rapture, her white hand Waked a most wild and dissonant harmony; And then a song broke forth, which on my soul Has sear'd its words in fire; ne'er heard since then, Till from my Agnes the ill-omen'd notes Stole on my nerves, like the cold ague's fit. BERTHA. Nor seen again? until our nuptial hour, When the flood whelm'd her. SWENO. Never.âThat direful music Was her last parting; nor did I hear reproach, Save on the morning of her piteous fate That ominous threat which burst over our bridal: But here indelible her image dwells, And shapeless fears appall me. BERTHA. Let the balm Of Bertha's tried affection soothe thy thoughts. SWENO. Go, Bertha, to thy couch: myself will follow, Short space to penitent devotion given. BERTHA. Tarry not, my loved lord. [Exit Bertha. SWENO, alone. (He sits down.) I know not why, Or what vain terrors undefined oppress me. There is no living thing can daunt my strength; But visions of the past rise thick before me, And his own secret thoughts quell Sweno's pride. O sleep, sweet sleep, when will thy balmy wing Lap me in still forgetfulness, without Thy fearful train of soul-appalling fancies? Steal, gentle soother, o'er my troubled spirits! [After a pause, the door opens slowly, and The Wanderer enters cautiously.] WANDERER. Sweno, awake! Hie thee to Agnes' chamber! Search the maid's bower! The dainty bird is gone, The virgin honors of thy house are blasted. Sweno, arise! or sit thou unrevenged, Till foul dishonor stare thee in the face Plain as the sun! Ubald has stolen thine Agnes. The vaulted chamber under Helen's chapel Is witness to their loves. There seek, there find them! Up, Sweno, rise! 'tis Elfrid bids thee wake! [Exit. SWENO. Are my thoughts crazed, or stood that form before me? Art thou a phantom from the oozy deep, Breaking night's stillness with unhallow'd voice, Or shape of flesh and blood, that warn'st me thus? The WANDERER, alias ELFRID, without, singing. The fiend has set his mark On their heads, dark, dark, And the spirit of vengeance is near his door. SWENO. The voice, the voice, the very tones of Elfrid! Dread judgment, hang'st thou o'er my fated house? Not on my child, great God of mercies, not On my poor Agnes!âBertha, Bertha, sleeps she In the sweet rest of innocence unharm'd? My child, my Agnes, hear me! Bertha! Bertha! [Exit. Scene III. Moonlight. Before the door of the Cavern under Helen's Chapel, which is seen above, and a projecting point of rock still higher. The River on one side appearing to wind close behind the projecting rock. The Monk is seen descending a rocky staircase from the Chapel, followed by Ubald and Agnes. The Monk unlocks the door of the Cavern. MONK. Fear nothing, lady, though the bridal couch Seem lonesome. Evil spirits have no power Over the chaste. Dread no worse warlock here, Than him whose mastering spell subdues thy beauty E'en to his wish and will. Sweet dreams of love And waking joys attend ye! [Exit. AGNES. O, loved Ubald, What have we done! where has thy passion led me! My maiden couch untenanted; my mother, My sire renounced! Will not the curse of heaven Burst on the rash and disobedient child? UBALD. Think not so gloomily! This night was cull'd From the pure calendar of hallow'd hours To be our bliss. AGNES. Ubald, a solemn blessing Upon my virgin forehead has just stamp'd The name of wife. It was my only wish, And this fond heart, though timid, should be joyous. Why does fear chill my thoughts? Why hangs a mist Of vague and shapeless terrors on my soul? Are they of guilty disobedience born, Or omens of deep warning? Cheer me, love, For my strength fails. UBALD. No breath of harm shall near thee; Bid thine eyes beam with joy! Come, gentle Agnes! AGNES. Nay, Ubald, stay, and breathe this pleasant air. See, how the moon rides glorious in yon sky! From infant years I loved that silver light, And the unvaried music of the waters, That glimmer with its beam. Pleasant and calm Under this rock falls sweetly on the ear The murmur of the river. Sit we here; That cave is terrible. UBALD. Light of my being, It grieves thine Ubald's tongue to say thee nay. Thy flight may be perceived, and hasty wrath Pour its arm'd scouts around. In that retirement Secure we rest; and vague pursuit may fret And spend its breathless speed, but never reach us. AGNES, (unwillingly yielding.) That cloister's vault is dismal as a tomb. [Exeunt. (The door closes after them grating heavily. After a short pause, enters The Wanderer Elfrid, cautiously.) ELFRID. Ye beetling rocks, and thou, lone chapel, once Witness of Elfrid's wrongs, behold her triumph! Haste, Sweno, to thy doom! The chapel closedâ All hush'dâall silentâsave this heart, which throbs As it would burst the impediments of life. O dreadful!âO my son! Thy reckless passion Has overleap'd my speed and marr'd thee. Ubald, Where art thou? Pray this earth to cover thee, Ere thy rash guilt be blazon'd to the sun! [A shriek is heard within the cavern. Hark to that shriek of fear! O vengeful phantoms, One moment yet be still!âCome, Sweno, Sweno! I am belated; in my own toils caught, And wrapp'd in terrors. Sweno! dullard, haste! (She ascends the stairs, and passes behind the Chapel. After a pause, enter from the cell hastily Agnes, Ubald.) AGNES. Night is terrific in that hideous cavern. UBALD. Nay, gentle Agnes. These are vain illusions, The coy fears of a maiden. Hath not Ubald Power, strength, and will, to shield thee from all danger? AGNES. Bear with me, Ubald; 'tis not lack of love, That scares me from thy couch. The icy hand Of horror is upon me. I dare not rest In that tremendous gloom. UBALD. Wayward enchantress, Night hath no darkness where my Agnes is! Thyself art light, and joy, and loveliness. Cheer thee, sweet trembler; on thy coral lips The breath of love is stirring. Thy chaste bosom Is the dear shrine of bliss. Appease thy fears. AGNES. O Ubald! as I near'd that frightful couch, Lifting its veil with slow and timid hand, I saw, though in thick darkness, plain and lit By its own ghastliness, a grinning fiend, And, shrieking, back I fell. Methought I lay Wrapt in my shroud and coffin, while around Glared thousand hideous phantoms as in triumph, The least too horrible for human gaze. I tremble, Ubald, and am thrill'd with dread; For love's dear sake forbear me. SWENO, (without.) Ubald! ho! AGNES. My father! Shield me, Ubald, from his wrath! [Enters Sweno with his sword drawn. Agnes shrinks back towards the rock.] SWENO. Traitor, my daughter!âO my Agnes here! (To Ubald.) Glorious requital of parental cares! Heap, heap dishonor on the house that rear'd thee, But hope not, caitif, to escape the sword Of an avenging father. Die, ungrateful! Perish, base-born seducer! UBALD, (parrying his blows without returning them.) Peace, peace, Sweno! Put up thy sword; Ubald would not offend One hair of thine for all the wealth of worlds. Sire of my Agnes, Ubald kneels to thee. [He drops on one knee. SWENO. Kneel not for life! Die, coward, faithless Ubald! UBALD, (rising.) Thy fury is unmanly. O beware, Stir not the fiend, which lurking in my heart Cries vengeance on thine head!âHold! hold! ELFRID, (on the rock above.) Thine oath! Thine oath! Slay him who made thee fatherless! UBALD. Tempt me no further, Sweno, on thy life! I know not if that wizard tongue speaks true, Which cries that Sweno made me fatherless. My thoughts grow perilous; there is that within me Which swells to think that I have lost a father, And lost by thee. Stand off, or bid good angels guard thee! SWENO. Die, traitor, die! This for my ravish'd daughter, This for foul breach of hospitable faith. (UBALD parries his blows.) AGNES. O father, hold! BERTHA, (without.) This way, this way! the din Of swords is loud. AGNES. Hold, husband, father, hold! ELFRID, (above.) Thine oath, thine oath! Think, Ubald, on thy sire! UBALD. The spirit of my parent calls for vengeance; Perish, fond thoughts! (UBALD at last fights with SWENO. Enter BERTHA, REYNALD, Knights, and Attendants with torches. AGNES at the same moment rushes forward to part UBALD and SWENO, and receives the point of SWENO'S sword in her breast. She shrinks back and hangs with both hands on UBALD'S shoulder; at the same time UBALD'S sword strikes down SWENO.) AGNES. O I am sorely hurt! (UBALD supports AGNES. BERTHA kneels by SWENO, and is engrossed with attendance on him.) UBALD. Lean on me; thus!âAh me, 'tis thy blood, Agnes. BERTHA. O Sweno, Sweno, thy life's fount is gushing. Thy blood wells fast away; I cannot staunch it. ELFRID, (above.) Sweno, look up! It is thy son, thy son! Elfrid's accursed issue sends thy soul Burning to Hell! It is thy son has made That hateful offspring of thy faithless nuptials As lost, as sunk in infamy, as curst, As she whose tongue upbraids thee! Agnes, Agnes, Despair and perish!âUbald is thy brother! UBALD. O horrible, horrible! Witch, fury, demon! There is a lying spirit in thy mouth; Thou durst not thus have outraged nature's mercies. ELFRID. Mercy for who shows mercy! Blood for blood! Ubald, yon fate-struck caitif was thy sire, Who cast thee fatherless on this wide world; Who murder'd Elfrid's fame, and peace, and reason, And made me what I am, Hell's slave and victim. My mother's frantic spirit stands beside him, Smiling in agony, and calls me hence! Am I not avenged? Now, now laugh out, Fiends of dismay! Mix earth, and air, and sea! Unbind the angels, which have power to slay When the sixth trump has sounded! Hell is loose, And nothing can the fiends of vengeance brew Feller than this!âO for a whirlwind's blast, To cover with unfathomable night The deeds which I have wrought!âMy brain is fire. Welcome, despair, and death, and phrensy, welcome! Eternal ruin yawns! I come! I come! (She springs from the rock into the torrent beneath.) REYNALD. Tremendous wreck of reason! O most dreadful! AGNES, (in a low voice to UBALD.) Cast me not from thee! I am gone, and quickly, Where they nor wed, nor are in marriage given. Dying I yet may clasp thine hand. Kind Ubald, One parting kiss, but pure as angel's greeting! O hold me up, fast, fast! I swim! I sink! 'Tis sweet to die upon thy bosom, Ubald. (She dies.) UBALD, (in a low voice.) Speak! gentle Agnes, say thou art not gone! O still, still, breathless, silent as the grave! SWENO, (whose eyes had continued riveted on the spot where ELFRID stood, and unconscious of what was passing round him.) Eternal justice, upon me alone, Not on mine issue, let thy terrors fall! My life is ebbing fast. Thine hand, loved Bertha! O Agnes, O my child, my child, where art thou? Thy voice was ever music to my soul; Say he is not thy husband! lift the weight Of that deep anguish, which appalls me dying! (BERTHA, who had been kneeling by SWENO without attending to AGNES, shrieks suddenly on perceiving that she is dead.) BERTHA. Ah me! she is gone for ever! Sweno, Sweno, She rush'd between thee and hot Ubald's sword, To stay the hasty temper of such wrath, And thine own hand has slain her. SWENO. O my child, If thou wert wedded to that bed of incest, Thy death is the sweet sleep of innocence, And life had been a curse! My gentle Agnes, Fatally hast thou rued one perilous act Of disobedience to thy guilty sire; And thou art gone before me!âI am sick With terrors keener than the pang of death. Beloved, ill-fated Bertha, thou hast found In me, who should have been thy stay and glory, The rock whereon thy hopes have all made wreck. Ubald, I charge thee, live! though scathed and blasted By heaven's dread bolt. UBALD, (starting from his silent contemplation of the dead AGNES.) Who bids that wretch, that once Was Ubald, live? His fount of life is dried! My Agnes was the life, the light of Ubald. (After a convulsive agony of grief, and a pause.) They say she was my sister, and thou father; And both are slainâmy father by my sword; And that wierd demon was indeed my mother! O world, what art thou, but a hell of horrors? And who bids Ubald live? (The Knights lay hands upon UBALD to prevent his injuring himself.) UBALD, (casting them with violence from him.) Unhand me, sirs; My wrath is dangerous. (After a pause, he throws down his sword.) Yes, I will live. Ubald will never shrink from fate.â(He kneels.) O father. Curse me not dying! At the tomb of Christ Through blood of infidels my sword shall hew Its way to pardon; the bare stone my couch, The spring my drink, and the hair-shirt my clothing. No joy, or pride, or hope shall come near Ubald; But strict achievement of dire penance cleanse My desolate soul of parricidal guilt, And for my bones win peace. SWENO. I curse thee not. Thou art my heirâA solemn contract. . . . I Destroyed itâI ... I ... FarewellâUbaldâBertha. (He dies.) BERTHA. O bitter fate! O cheerless! in one day Stript of all joy, more lonesome than the dead! (To UBALD.) Monster, this curse shall cling to thee; thy guilt, Redder than scarlet, shall incarnadine The banners of the just, and bar them from The temple of their Savior; and the tomb, Whose indiscriminate yearning swallows all, Shall cast thy marrowless unquiet bones Forth from its maw: no mass or requiem Shall win for thy gaunt skeleton a place In the still church's bosom, till the lapse Of hundred winters shall have hush'd the wail Of thy remorseful spirit, and earn'd for thee That rest which death denies the parricide! (Rising.) Yet one word, ere we part for ever, Ubald! Sleeps that fair victim undefiled in death? UBALD. The dew of blushing morn has never bathed A bud of innocence more pure and stainless. BERTHA. Swear it! by all the wreck which thou hast wrought, By all thy hopes of mercy, Ubald, swear it! UBALD. God's lightning rive this head already blasted, If ought my love has dared, which should have call'd One blush to the pure cheek of virgin meekness! BERTHA. Heaven's mercies hover o'er thy head, mine Agnes! (throwing herself down with her cheek on AGNES.) Here let me lie, and breathe my last beside thee! REYNALD. Ubald, we have been foes, but in this ruin, As all our hopes, so be our angers buried. Here let us close as friends. Unto Christ's banner With thee I vow my strength. Thou, stately offspring Of the most noble house, soar eagle-like Aloft, and let the gale, which rived thine eyrie, But waft thee nearer to thy native heaven. END OF THE WIERD WANDERER.</field>
