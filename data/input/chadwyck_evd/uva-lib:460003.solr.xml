      <field name="fulltext">THE Fall of BOB: OR, The Oracle of Gin. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Say; hast thou not of Usurpation read; Read, of a Tyrant in his mimick Throne, By Avarice and Cruelty entour'd, Rule with an Iron Rod an harrass'd Land, Oppress the virtuous and the nobly born; Raise from the Dunghills, Miscreants, whose Souls Were form'd for Mischief, and whose innate Hate Of what was good, made 'em fit Tools of Pow'r? Hast thou not read of Desolation dire, Of solemn Murders, sanctify'd by Law; Of Judges, who have set their Souls to Sale, And traffick'd in the Blood of Innocence? Hast thou not too, of a Sham Senate read, A Sham Protector, and his Standing Troops, Which stain'd with Blood the Face of Liberty, And drove the beauteous Goddess from our Isles? Yet Scarce such Ills deserve the Name of Woe, When with the Loss of Darling GIN compar'd. Anonyn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. If Novelty can please, I think 'tis clear, In all, but want of Sense, you have it here: For some small Spice of Sense, we pleaded hard To have the whole quite new; our headstrong Bard Wou'd not be mov'd, by all that we cou'd say, And swore, we had a Mind to damn his Play. My Tragick Vein, said he, must take the Town, My Diction puts, ev'n Hurlo-Thrumbo down, And soars beyond their Caption, or my own For common Sense, it is exploded quite, It checks the Poet in his rapid Flight; That, and all Unity of Place and Time We heartily despise, who write sublime. Instead of Probability and these Han't I Machines, and Harlequin to please? Can you deny these Wit? Again, my Thunder, And Light'ning's Blaze, will make an Audience wonder. These are fine Stroaks of Wit, which raise a Name And give an Author everlasting Fame: These captivate the Sense, these give Delight, These prove an Author does with Judgment write And fill the House upon the Poet's Night. Damn common Sense, 'tis so much out of Fashion, I wou'd not write it, tho' to save a Nation. That he may hit your Taste, your Favour win, He has beside all these, the Ghost of Gin; Coblers and Coopers, who reform the State, Yet think it much below them to be great. In these the Roman Spirit still survives, For Gin and Liberty, they'll give their Lives: Fearless of Death, resolving to be free, But you shall see, by'nd bye what you shall see.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE the Street. Poet SCRUBB booted, in a shabby Riding Dress. Despair is pictur'd in each Face I meet, And hollow Groans are heard in ev'ry Street; Distillers Shops, of Dirt and Mirth the Scene, Are hush'd as Death, their Floors and Counters clean: Shreeks of desponding Matrons wound the Air, And drooping Car-Men, seem oppress'd with Care. Sure some Disaster terrible, as strange, Has, in my Absence, wrought this dreadful Change. But see old Funk, the Cobler, comes this Way. His Looks as gloomy, as a Winter's Day: Like all I've met, he seems with Grief oppress'd, And Sighs to Sighs, succeeding, rend his Breast. Enter Funk. O! 'tis nobly done, ye envious Great To bring, yourselves, such Ruin on the State! We now believe a Nero fir'd Rome, And ripp'd, with unconcern, his Mother's Womb; For ye have prov'd, by this your Fel Decree That there are Monsters greater yet than he. Oh piercing Sorrow; Quintessence of Grief, O Woe of Woes: O woe beyond Relief, Philosophy must sink beneath this Stroke, Enough to cleave, not Hearts of Men but Oak. Scrub. Say, Friendly Funk, whence springs thy sad Complaint Why are thy Looks so wan; thy Voice so faint? Why, in full Tide of Day, ha'st left thy Stall, And thrown aside thy Ends, thy Last, thy Awl? Why does thy Whistling cease; and say, O why Is Horror seated in thy down cast Eye? Funk. And art thou Stranger to th'oppressing Woe, Which gives our Breasts to heave, our Eyes to flow; Which like the melting Snows, from Alpine Hills, Swell to a Torrent's Rage the peaceful Rills, Then with a rapid, and resistless Force, Triumphing ov'r what e'er would check their Course, They proudly sweep along, diffusing wide O'er all the Plains th'inexorable Tide; Herds, Flocks and Villages become its Prey, And by the Deluge, all are swept away? No Wonder then I'm careless of my Stall, Since like Destruction, is decreed for all. Scrub. But still thou wreck'st me, say; what is the Cause? Funk. Thus, when curs'd Jealousy th'unhappy gnaws, He grows impatient; is on Racks to find What, when discover'd, robs his Peace of Mind. The ill, I cannot name, do thou divine, And, by thy Grief, add double Weight to mine. Scrub. No hostile Sword invades the British State? Funk. That Ill wou'd, chiefly, fall upon the Great: Entrench'd, in Poverty, secure we'd lie And see Confusion, with a careless Eye. Scrub. Has the Bank broke, or does th'Exchequer fail, Sheep take the Rot, or Popery prevail? Funk. These Ills, indeed, a slight Concern might give, But are inferior to the Ill we grieve, Scrub. No Fire, I hopeâ Funk. Should Cities blaze, our Class can little lose: Who goes half Bare-Foot, may as well want Shoes. Scrub. In Price, does Cow-heel rise; or Gibraltar, Does Spain demand, with Menaces of War? Funk. Cow-heel, is cheap, as even thou coud'st, wish, The Great, as yet, are Strangers to the Dish. Of Gibraltar, so well the Weight we know, No Threats, from Spain, will make us let it go: Butâwere that lost, and with it Port-Mahoon Thou'lt weep a greater Loss, I fear, too soon. But Lo, thy Liveretta comes; no more The Blooming gentle Fair, she was before. View her sunk Eyes, behold her fallen Jaws, Her matted Hair, her Rags, her Pace, her Straws, Which are the sad Effects, ofâa much sadder Cause. I cannot bear the Sight, my Heart will rise, And all my Mother Stream into my Eyes [Exit. Scrub. What Cause cou'd bring such Desolation on In six Weeks Time, the most I have been gone Enter Liveretta, sings. I. It was in the Christmas Week, When my Granny she sate by the Fire, She sent me to buy an Ox-Cheek, And I fell with it all in the Mire. II. Come buy a Sheeps Head or a Liver Buy my fresh Lights for your Cat, But boil all the Lights that you give her, Wou'd you have her a Match for a Rat. Scrub. O my Liveretta; O! my enchanting Fair. Liv. Stand offâand give Sublimity more Air, Ha! I shou'd know Theeâyes, I know Thee well, Thou bought'st, our Votes, and did'st thy Suffrage sell; With Gold and Fawning did'st our Favour win, And damnd'st us all, in damning of our Gin: Thus Satan's said to deal with simple Witches, Who truck their Souls for transitory Riches. Scrub. Alass! thou know'st me notâ Liv. I know Thee not! do'st thou not Weekly shew, Tho starv'd by Want, we yet in Riches flow; Tho' by each Nation, rifled, aw'd and spurn'd, By us, alone, the Scale of Pow'r is turn'd; Tho' by Corruption, we're no longer free, You Weekly preach, that Chains are Liberty: Yes, Mother Osborn, thou'rt within our ken, We know thy Venal Soul, and prostituted Pen. Scrub. Still, still you errâ Liv. Ha! Thou art Caleb, for I know thy waddle, And bent to win the Horse, or lose the Saddle, Most furiously, for Common-Wealth thou driv'st, And for an Oligarchy vainly striv'st: The Reins of Pow'r, a skilful Hand must guide, Believe me it is more than up and ride; The Art of Governing's not known to all, Remember Phaeton, and dread his Fall. [Exit. Scrub. What mighty Ill can thus distract her Soul, And banish Reason, far as Pole from Pole. [a dead Sound of Cleavers and Marrow-Bones. What melancholy Sound is this I hear, Which, mix'd with Groans, rings dreadful in my Ear! [loud Groans and Shreeks behind the Scenes. Horror, where 'ere I turn, affronts my Eyes And fills my Heart with Terror and Surprize. Enter. A March of Butchers with Marrow-Bones and Cleavers, the Latter cover'd with black Crape follow'd by Men and Women, two and two, the Men with Mourning Hat-Bands and white Handkerchiefs at their Eyes, the Women with Crape over their Faces, and their Hair loose; they march round the Stage, the Butchers beating a dead March, when they front the Audience, Bavius Orator of Grub-Street advance. Bav. This grateful Sorrow shewn by streaming Eyes, Those hollow Groans, which make your Bosoms rise; This doleful Dress, and still more doleful Face, Your dreadful Musick and your Solemn Pace, Do well the Greatness of our Loss express And speak the Sorrows which our Souls oppress, Tho' had we Pow'r but equal to our Grief In childish Tears, we wou'd not seek Relief. No; as from Jove, the redden'd Bolt should fly And liquid Light'ning scorch the spangled Sky; My dreadful Thunder o'er the welkin rowl And shake the nether World from Pole to Pole. I'd move those Rocks, which bound old Neptune in, And Deluge shou'd revenge the Loss of Gin. Scrub. (Aside) A Tremor siezes on my Heart; those Words Are worse than Famine, Pestilence or Swords. [All the Assistants groan. Bav. But lest Revenge on Britain shou'd prove vain, And she gain Pow'r by the extended Main, My forked Light'nings shou'd her Fleet consume, And all her Nobles find a watry Tomb. Omnes. âOhâOhâOhâOhâAlass! alass! and then Hang them all up, that they may dry again. Funk [advancing.] The Story's sad; but yet, let me advise, The Proverb says be merry, but be wise; If we shou'd burn the Fleet,âmindâwe shou'd render A Passage safe, to Pope and to Pretender: The Protestant Religion then wou'd be, As ev'ry one may judge, in Jeopardy: And that wou'd prove, next to the Loss of Gin, A grievous Ill, if not a crying Sin, Omnes. No, by no Means, let us not burn the Fleet. Bav. To check my Light'nings then you think it meet? Stitch [advancing.] Oh! of all Love; and, Bavius, if you please, Be not too rash, in letting in the Seas; Let the Rocks stand.â Bav. Leave Nature on her Hooks? Steel the Butcher. Nor drown our Nobles;âsome are in my Books. Woman. Oh! do not thunder, Bavius, for I swear When e'er it thunders, I'm half dead with Fear. Bav. Not thunder Woman! by the Gods above, I'll thunder louder than the Thund'rer Jove. [A Noise of Frying Pans. What mournful Sounds are these which wound the Air? Enter one. A Message MÃ¦vius brings you from Rag-Fair. [MÃ¦vius preceeded by three Frying Pans hung with Crape. MÃ¦vius. With Sorrow this, with Grief this Hand replete, Ye Grub-Street Sages, am I sent to meet, Since Bums have driv'n their darling Scrub away, The Rag-Fair Chiefs, have pitch'd on me, this Day, Both in their Names, and friendly Words to greet Ye Fellow-Sufferers of the fam'd Grub-Street, Where PhÅbus keeps his Court, the Muses fix their Seat. Our present Woe, I own, I scarce can bear, Suppress my Sighs, or check the ready Tear; Groans driv'n by Groans, and Sighs push'd on by Sighs, Are upwards forc'd, and strike the Azure Skies. When Friends now meet, they on each other stare, Their Silence loudly speaks their Load of Care, And Looks, amaz'd, dart Terror and Despair. Thus Rome, when Brennus, with his conqu'ring Gauls, Thro' Italy had pierc'd, and forc'd her Walls, Saw Matrons flying with dishevell'd Hair Wounding with dreadful Shrieks the ambient Air Her gen'rous Senate saw in Curules plac'd, Despising Life, with glorious Wounds defac'd. So when an Infant does its Rattle lose, Or teazing Fools deprive it of new Shoes, Its Breast is swell'd, and Floods of briny Tears Speak its oppressing Grief, or racking Fears. That by your Aid, we all may find Relief, At least, may ease the Burthen of our Grief, I'm bid to say, that Sages of known Worth, Cow-Cross, St. Giles's, Thieving-Lane, send forth, Who with the wisest of the Borough meet The Field-Lane Chiefs, and Leaders of our Street: These in a Corps, your Wisdom understood, Beg you will join them for the Publick Good; The Mint and Drury-Lane will add their Care, The Place of Meeting pitch'd on, is Rag-Fair. Bav. Your Message does us Honour: lead the Way, It is not just we make the Council stay. MÃ¦v. Ye Frying-pans, with solemn Steps precede. Bav. Our doleful March the Marrow-bones shall lead. [Exeunt in Procession. Scrub solus. Is then inspiring Gin, at length, deny'd, And must this Spring of Wit and Mirth be dry'd! The Rash, with Gin, were cautious, Cowards stout; Hunger was dampt, and piercing Cold shut out. Inspir'd by Gin, I patiently have born, The Stings of Poverty, and rich Fools scorn; Reflected on the shifting Scene of Things, Contemn'd the wicked Great, and pity'd Kings: For Time, still changing, raises and casts down, Kings sink in Slaves, Slaves, rise to wear a Crown. At Tyburn, Mortimer was forc'd from Day, Yet, did his Seed the English Scepter sway. My Spirits rais'd, my Blood by Gin made warm, I cou'd defy the surly'st Winter Storm; This only Comfort gone, what is there here, Is worth a Wish, or can engage my Care? Now Liveretta's lostâI'll not complain, For Sorrow, equally, and Rage are vain: Death will soon end my melancholy Story, And Crop the happiest in his Height of Glory. End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. It was in the Christmas Week, When my Granny she sate by the Fire, She sent me to buy an Ox-Cheek, And I fell with it all in the Mire. II.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE draws and discovers Liveretta reclin'd on a Bulk; on one Side, a Black-shoe Boy playing on a Bladder and String; on the other, a Chimney-sweeper playing on a Salt-Box with a Rolling-Pin. She rises and comes forward. Musick, I've heard, ev'n savage Breasts can charm, And of their Rage the hungry Wolves disarm. Ev'n Stones obey'd, when Harmony has call'd, And by perswasive Sounds, a City wall'd; So prevalent was Musick, sweet its Force, Trees were allur'd, and Rivers check'd their Course; In Measures regular did Oaks advance, And Kids and Lyons mingled in the Dance. What then am I, am I more senseless grown Than Beasts or Trees, than Rivulets or Stone. Oh Force of Woe! oh penetrating Grief! What cou'd melt Rocks, can yield me no Relief. Methinks I see the Monarch of the Grave (The only Refuge that the Wretched have) Stretch forth his macerated Arms to me, (Those Arms which only can from Sorrow free) He'll hug me close, close to his clayey Breast, Where I shall find uninterrupted Rest. No, charming Prince, in vain thou shalt not wooe, Lock'd in thy Arms we will like Turtles cooe; While round thy Skeleton my Limbs are curl'd; My Soul shall visit the Refulgent World; From Orb to Orb, my Stellar Course I'll shape, And swim in liquid Light, and float on Seas of Cant Word for Gin. Tape. Oh Extasy of Thought! freed from this Din, My Soul shall quaff eternal Drams of Gin. [Throws herself on the Ground. Grim, lovely Death, to thee I'll force my Way, I'll follow Gin, tho' Kings shou'd court my Stay. [dies. Smut the Chimney-sweeper. Thus, have I seen fair Elms, which topp'd the Wood, Which all the Rage of angry Winters stood, Whose lofty Summits sought the vaulted Sky, Whose far-spread Roots did threat'ning Storms defy, By sudden Tempests from Earth's Bosom torn, Become the Sport of Boreas, and his Scorn. Japan the Shoe-boy. Here, in these Ruins, hapless Men may see How vain is Beauty! vain Philosophy! The Paphian Goddess form'd her lovely Face, And in her Steps we saw a Juno's Grace; Faultless in Form, and in her Temper sweet, In Conversation gay, but yet discreet; Her Eyes at once both Love and Awe inspir'd, And chill'd the Bosom which their Light'ning fir'd: Her Voice was such, that when it bless'd our Ears, We thought we heard the Musick of the Spheres. How have I follow'd in dark Nights and Rain, The Nymph to Wapping, even from Field-Lane, To hear her cry Sheeps Heads, and thought the long And dirty Walk rewarded by her Song: But still, th'Heroick Beauties of her Mind Those of her matchless Form as far out-shin'd, As Sol in Blaze of gorgeous Light array'd Exceeds the Gleam by Farthing-Candle made. Oh! with what Equanimity she'd bear Th'Assaults of Hunger and inclement Air! Thro' Frost and Snow she would her Wainfleets cry, Nor mention Cold, if Customers would buy. No Northern Blasts could keep the Fair One in, Nor soalless Shoes, all Ills were drown'd in Gin. Gin dry'd her Feet, Gin thaw'd the frozen Air, Rags might let Water in, but Gin kept out all Care. Smut. Ye Members, see the Ruin you've brought on. And view, in her, the Mischiefs you have done. That Constancy of Mind, by which she'd slight The Sleet, the Cold of blust'ring Winter's Night, By which, courageously, thro' Seas she bore Of Wants, which daily flow upon the Poor, Is, by prohibiting that Gin be drunk, Shut from the Day, in endless Darkness sunk. Jap. So the wreck'd Mariner who vig'rous laves, With brawny Arms, the small insulting Waves, Like Neptune triumphs, o'er the Billows rides, And stems courageously opposing Tides; Is, by a Mountain Sea which threats the Coast, O'erlaid, and spight of Resolution lost. Smut. Coriolanus so unmov'd could hear His Country's Groans, the humbled Senate's Pray'r, Firmly resolv'd to make th'ungrateful Town Repent the vile Ingratitude they'l shewn, He banish'd all Compassion from his Breast, And to her Fall inexorable press'd; Yet when his Mother sued for destin'd Rome, The Hero's Constancy was overcome. Jap. Let us bear hence this Quintessence of Merit, Smutt. For dead she is, and dy'd for want of Spirit. [They carry her off. SCENE changes to a Distiller's Back-Shop. Enter Worm with a Rope in his Hand. Whether 'tis better here to live contemn'd, Or else, to Misery to put an End; Bravely to swing beyond the Reach of Fate, And scorn a World we can't enjoy in State, Is now the Question? Can Worm's Spirit bear To sell his Horse, and to put down his Chair, Ev'n when he'd thought of driving with a Pair. Can I submit on Sundays to walk out, For Air, for Cakes, for Twopenny and Stout, With Wife and Children trudge thro' Clouds of Dust, Can I bear this, ye Gods, or is it just! Must my dear Wife her dear Repeater lose, Wear Yard-wide Stuffs, who'll now plain Silks refuse, And my poor Babes,âmust they too want lac'd Shoes. Must I such Woe, such Desolation see, I, who supported them in Finery. [Puts the Noose about his Neck. No; I'll choak the Thought, I'll take my Flight, And bid the cruel, churlish World good night. [Hangs himself. Enter Mrs. Worm. Who's there? JohnâTomâhave I no Servants then? SarahâMaryâWhat! neither Maids nor Men? Enter a Man-Servant. Madamâdid your LadyshipâMadam, call? Mrs. Worm. Impertinent!âI'll clear the House of allâ These ill-bred Cits.â You have been told to enter with a Bow, And silent wait till I my Pleasure shew. Indeed, with Mr. Worm you may be free, But know great Difference lies 'twixt him and me. He is a Tradesman, but learn, Sir, that I, Keep Company, and play with Quality: Know, Silence speaks Respect: Pray learn that Art, Or you and I shall very quickly part. [Servant bows, sees his Master hanging, and makes Signsâpulls out his Knife, and in dumb Shew seems to ask if he shall cut him down. But what do all these antick Gestures mean? What are you mimicking a Harlequin? [Spies her Husband. Oh Heav'ns and Earth, how shocking is this Sight! 'Twill spoil my being at the Court To night. Oh wretched Woman! Oh unlucky Day! Four Hours Time in Dress quite thrown away. [Aside. [Bursts out a crying. Fly! cut him down; Why does the Fellow stare? This Disappointment is too great to bear. [Aside. [The Servant cuts him down. Why James, John, Joe, the Devil take you all, How do these careless Rascals make me bawl. Enter Three Men. Go feel your Master's Pulse, if he's not dead? Carry him up, and put him into Bed. 1 Serv. How came this fatal Accident about? Mrs. Worm. Fatal indeed; it stops my going out. 2 Serv. He breathes and groans. Mrs. Worm. âconvey him to his Room. Joe, do you run, bid Mr. Launcet come [Exit Joe. To let him blood; bid Sarah warm his Bed: James, do you chafe the Temples of his Head. [Servants carry off Worm. Oh cruel Fortune! thou hast shewn thy Spight, I shou'd have seen the Drawing-Room To-night. This cruel Baulk, what Flesh and Blood can bear! Oh cursed Luck! Oh Destiny severe! By Decency confin'd, I stay at Home, But still my Heart is in the Drawing-Room. [Exit. SCENE the Street. Scrubb, Japan. Scrubb. Ha! Dare to dispute the hungry Lion's Prey, With the wing'd Light'nings of the Thund'rer play; Scale Heav'ns high Battlements, insult Jove's Throne, Deride his Godhead, and his Pow'r disown, Rather than dare to think my Fair One's dead. Jap. 'Tis true, your Anger like the Gods I dread, To you I owe, whene'er you have it, Bread. But stillâ Scrub. What! shall a very Mortal dare to say Immortal Beauties are become mere Clay! Safer thou may'st set heav'nly Pow'r at nought, 'Tis daring for a God to think the Thought. Jap. We sought all Means to give the Fair Relief, And hop'd, by Harmony, to sooth her Grief; With Salt-box Lid, and with a Rolling-pin, I thought to drown the racking Loss of Gin, While Smut, in Concert, on the Bladder play'd, The softest Airs, to calm the ruffled Maid: But Death, thy Rival, hastily came in, And promising no less than Seas of Gin, Found her blind Side; she taken with the Snare, He snapp'd her up, as Greyhound wou'd a Hare. Scr. Has Death then ta'en her by so vile a Trick? Jap. And bore her off, as Buzzard does a Chick. Scrub. Vile Poltroon, Death, base Scoundrel, treach'rous Slave, Do'st hope to find an Azyle in the Grave? In Earth's dark Bowels vainly dost thou dive, And to elude my Rage, do'st vainly strive: To th'Center dart, I'll to the Center too, Or plunge in Seas, thro' Seas will I pursue; If by the fiery Lake thou think'st t'escape In th'fiery Lake, I'll seize thee for the Rape, Drag thee to Light, force thee to quit thy Prize, And give the World new Blaze from Liveretta's Eyes. Death descends from the Clouds in a gilt Chariot, his Dress compleat, a large Bag-Wig aud solitaire lac'd Wastecoat, clock'd Stockings, &amp;c. Snuff-Box in his Hand, several Footmen behind his Chariot. Death. Methought, as I drove by, to take the Air, Complaints and Threats broke, roundly, on my Ear. My Name is Death; and if there's any one Will call me to account for what I've done, I wear a Sword, Mardi, and Strike me dead If I fear any Man that wears a Head. Scr. The Threats and eke Complaints from me arose, My Name is Scrub, and if thou'rt Death, we're Foes. Thou'st Robb'd meâ Death. Robb'd thee! why Prithee what had'st thou to lose, Except thy Wits, which offer'd, I'd refuse. Scrub. Thou'st robb'd me with insinuating Art, Of Liveretta, Princess of my Heart. With Mountain-Promises, thou drew'st her in, And mad'st her hope Eternal Seas of Gin. Death. Scrub, give's thy Handâwe'er Friends; I'm not the Death, Who charm'd with Liveretta, stopt her Breath; I am the Death of thoughtless Fools Estates, And bring young Spendthrifts to the Prison-Grates. Of gay beau Tradesmen, and your trusting Taylor, I kill the Stock, then give them to the Jailor. Scrub. In what an Error then have I gone on! I find, by you, there are more Deaths than one. Death. Oh! we're a numerous Clan. Scrub. âBut by the Bye, Is there a Death, my Friend, for Poverty? Death. There is, and if you wou'd conciliate This Death, you'll do it at an easy Rate; Lay common Sense and Decency aside, Flatter the GREAT, burn Incense to their Pride; Keep a large Stock of Billinsgate at hand, And let your Writings be mere Ropes of Sand; 'Tis hard to answer, what none understand. A Flow of Words employ, instead of Sense; Instead of Truth, make use of Impudence: Lye roundly; if refuted, lye again; Beware of Wit, for that will prove thy Bane. A great Man never will be pleas'd to see An Understrapper have more Wit than he. In Probity the same; the Men who rule By Conscience, write a Man, or Wise, or Fool: Banish that Clog, only thy Interest prize, Pimp, flatter, lye, and thou wilt surely rise. [Death returns to his Chariot. Scrub. By Means so vile I never will be rich. [Exit. Death. Thou'lt then live poor, and die, like Dog in Ditch. [Speaks out of his Chariot. [Flies off.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Mr. and Mrs. Worm. Mrs. Worm. But why, my Dear, did'st take this desp'rate Course? Tho' Times are bad, we both have known them worse. Reflect, my Life, when first you set up Trade, Scarce had we Money, Love, to purchase Bread; And hardly yet have seven Years gone round, But you can fairly shew Ten Thousand Pound. Mr. Worm. Ay, there's my Grief; for less than two Years more Cou'd not have fail'd t'have made that Ten a Score; Another Year, if still our Trade had held, That Twenty had to Thirty Thousand swell'd. In our Elections then I'd been of Weight, And I'd been courted even by the GREAT; Honours and Money had flown in upon me, And thou had'st been my Lady Worm, my Honey. [Chucks her under the Chin. Mrs. W. Still there are Means to rise, you know the Court Rewards all those who do its Schemes support. Mr. W. Against my Conscience and my Country vote? Mrs. W. These are mere Words, my Dear, you've got by rote. Mr. W. What! when my Country's Liberty's in Danger! Mrs. W. T'Affairs of State I find you are a Stranger. About your Country you make much ado, But what's its Rights or Liberties to you? If you went bare foot, wou'd it give you Shoes? And shou'd I for it an Advantage lose? What by your Country must be understood, The Soil, the Trees, the Rivers or the Wood? Mr. W. No, none of these, by Country you must know Is meant the People. Mrs. W. âPeople! be it so. Among them all name one wou'd give a Crown If you were hang'd, my Dear, to cut you down. Mr. W. Ecod that's rightâ [Considering. Mrs. W. âOh is it so? then learn That such a People is not worth Concern. But be things bad, as even Caleb writes, And that the Court designs upon our Rights; That th'Army will impose the slavish Yoke; Are you sufficient to avert the Stroke? Mr. W. Ecod that's true. Mrs. W. âWell then, if you foresee You can't prevent impending Slavery, Wou'd you for Company wear Chains, who might be free? Mr. W. Why no. [Scratching his Head. Mrs. W. Which of the two, think you, the better fares, Who plunder'd is, or who the Plunder shares? Mr. W. Why troth, my Dear, there's much in what you say. Mrs. W. By me be guided, I will make your Way. To Riches and to Honour, tho' Trade fails. To ev'ry Wind the Sailor trims his Sails; He takes th'Advantage, when the Gale is fair, But when its cross, does he for that despair, Or in a Tempest lay aside all Care? Mr. W. Troth, that's well saidâI find, my Dear, by you, If one Trade won't, another Trade will do. Let who will walk on Foot, or who can, ride; He must want Brains who strives against the Tide. Mrs. W. You see the Winds root up the sturdy Oak, The pliant Willow, never Tempest broke. Mr. W. Which is most likely Party of the two, To plunder or be plunder'd, I would know; For, as I said, I ne'er will stem the Tide, That is, my Dear, I'll chuse the strongest Side. Mrs. W. Why that's no Question, Honey, 'tis the Court. Mr. W. I think it is, and I am sorry for't. The Country is so poor, so much kept under, That it will yeild, I fear, but little Plunder; How'ere, I'm for the Court: there's Prudence shewn When we cant get, that we can keep our own. Enter a Servant. Mr. Stillhead, Sir. Worm. âWhere? Serv. âHe waits below. If you see Company, he'd gladly know. Worm. Pray shew him up.â Mrs. W. âI'll leave you. Mr. âPrithee why? Mrs. W. It may'nt be proper that I should be by. Stick to the Choice you've made; depend 'tis right, And you may soon expect to be aâKnight. [Exit. Enter Stillhead. Foul Desolation rears its baleful Head, And o'er the State its leathern Wings has spread. W. The Nation's Sins, my Friend, enormous great! Has harm'd us all to this destructive Fate. They're Pride and Luxury, to which we owe, These Days of Sorrow, and this Weight of Woe. What flagrant Wickedness! in ev'ry Street, Toupees, lac'd Wastecoats, and Queue Wigs we meet. The Alehouses are grown so rich of late, They scorn their Pewter, and drew all in Plate. The Vintners too, may now for Sheriffs fine, And even Poets dare Presume to dine: Whores, Playhouses, Vauxhall, and Masquerade, Lacemen and Cooks, Taylors and ev'ry Trade, Which tend to Luxury have Fortunes made. These are loud crying Sins!â Stillhead. âBut why should all The Punishment, upon Distillers fall? Worm. Short-sighted Mortals do so little know, That Blessings, oft, they count a grievous Woe. Still. Why do'st thou think, Friend Worm, I cannot see This Act has brought upon me Beggary. I can't but breakâ Worm. But there are other Ways, But which you may a greater Fortune raise. Still. But name me one. Worm. Whyâyou have good Invention, Write for the Ministry, and get a Pension. Still. But I'm no Scholarâ Worm. Where Learning brings a Man to keep his Chariot, To Want, it dooms five hundred, and a Garret, Of those who're curs'd with Merit to their Share, 'Twas never known that Fortune wou'd take care. Suppose, as you're no Scholar, you shou'd take To Bookselling, you may a Fortune make; The Trouble's small, but monstrous are the Gains, Which are extracted from poor Author's Brains? The Bookseller's at Ease, his Authors work; They are the harrass'd Slavesâhe the Grand Turk Still. No, No; to this my Conscience can't submit. W. Why, where's the Harm, you only bite a Wit? None calls it Cheating when the Biter's bit. They rob old Books, t'impose upon the Town, And you rob them, of what? what's not their own. What think you, if you shou'd commence Attorney? Still. No, if I ever do, may Satan burn me; What live by others Ruin and Vexation! Copies of Writs, and those of Declaration, Notice of Enquirey and Execution. Worm. Why now you talk methinks with Elocution, You'll make a Figure in the Sheriff's Court, Take to the Law: to cut the Matter short, Where forty Shillings to the Plaintiff's due, Full six Times, that the Charges bring to you. You're sure of being paid, for let us say The Plaintiff's poor and forc'd to run away, What's that to you? You've the Defendant still; Suppose him restiff, and won't pay your Bill, Why sue him next, it brings more Grift to Mill. Run him to Execution, strip his House, And do not leave the Rascal worth a Souse. Still. I'd sooner beg, than live by licens'd Plunder. Worm. I fear your Conscience, long, will keep you under. Turn Counsel thenâ Still. âWhat, Counsel without reading! Worm. Pshaw; Noise and Impudence pass now for pleading. If your Opinion's ask'd on any Case, First take your Fee, then with a thinking Face Say you'll consider on't: you've much to do, But they shall have it in a Day or two; Next search your Books (soon as your Client's gone,) You'll find a Case in Point 'tis ten to one; But say you don't, sign what you guess is right; If you are wrong, your Client suffers by't. Not youâ Still. Why what you now advance, I think is true; But mayn't I thus some Families undo? Worm. Pshaw; that's Practice Man; 'tis your Client's Fault, If when you leave him, he's not worth a Groat; Ruin, by Law, was ever understood; As Flies are Spider's, Fools are Lawyer's Food. Still. Shall I give Colour? No, I ne'er can do't To puzzle Juries and protract a Suit: Or else as void of Conscience and of Honour, Frustrate the known Intent of some wise Donor; Cut off Remainders by Recovery, And give the Heir the Cryer as Vouchee? Think you, this just, is this a Recompence? Nay don't it shock a Man of common Sense, To hear a Judge most learnedly decree On what he knows is feign'd as well as we? Worm. E'n take to Physick, print, distribute Bills, And vaunt some Nostrum, whether Drops or Pills; Which cures all present, past, and future Ills. A few hard Words, Narcotick, Sudorifick, Nephritick with Cathartick and Prolifick, Emetick and Hidropick, with few such (Tho' misapply'd it does not Matter much) With a bronz'd Front, full Wig, and solemn Looks, Some Monsters Skins, some Butterflys, Greek Books; Sea Feathers, Corrals, Embryo's in Wine, Pieces of Rocks, and bits of Roman Coin, Will set you up: Nay even less may do, For Virtuoso and Physician too. Doctors will thrive, while Fools in Britain swarm, And that will be, while yours and my Head's warm. Still. But should I poyson by my Want of Skill, Worm. You'll gain Experience, Friend, by those you kill. Those who recover tho' by Strength of Nature, Will cry you up; and dead Men write no Satyr: Lawyers by ruin live, your Bawds by billing, But Army Men and Doctors live by killing. Still. Suppose I'm ask'd what 'tis my Patients ail? Worm. Oh! Doctors of an Answer never fail; For if they'r puzzled; Rules of Art afford, A Kakaxia, or some barb'rous Word. Still. If Virtues of my Med'cines they consult? Worm. You answer strait, the Quality's occult. Come, come, we'll o're a Bottle find within Some Succedaneum to our fallen Gin. [Exeunt. SCENE opens and discovers Bavius, MÃ¦vius, Scrub, Funk, Stitch, Smut, Japan, Steel, and others round a Table, with Alehouse Pots, Pipes and Tobacco. Scrub. The Cause of meeting here, there's none need tell, 'Tis too well known Omnes. âAy indeed too well, Scrub. Let then each Man with Freedom speak his Mind, And thus, perhaps, some Remedy you'll find. But let us not in idle Speeches waste The precious Time; the Ill requires haste, Tun. Most learnedly, O Scrub, you state the Case, (Tho' it is such, as beggars all my Race:) Wherefore, since we can nothing execute, 'Tis better to submit, than to dispute; To our Petitions let us have recourse, And not, by struggling, make our Case much worse. Funk. Let us resolve to have the Statute alter'd, Or die like Menâ Tunn the Cooper. âTrue; like Hero's halter'd. Bavius. Meanly Petition! No, our Soul's too great, Let swift Destruction seize the cruel State; To Arms, to Arms, 'tis Bavius will begin, And Blood wash out the Statute against Gin. To Souls like mine, Death is more glorious far, Than mean Submission; wherefore I'm for War. Enter Harlequin. But see the Soul of Wisdom, Harlequin, Comes to assist us in retrieving Gin. Say thou Town's Joy, thou Source of Wit and Spirit, Say thou who, only, art allow'd true Merit. Shou'd Men like us e're condescend to sue! No, let our Swords the cruel Act cut thro', And bravely thus this Gordian Knot undo. Harlequin waves his Wand, it thunders and lightens, Gin descends from the Clouds in the Shape of a Tun. Gin. I am the Soul of Gin, 'twas I who fir'd The Soldiers breast; the Poet's Muse inspir'd: Mind well my Words, and with Attention hear, And like an Oracle those Words revere. Who kicks against the Pricks may hurt his Foot, Who bears one load, does add another to't. A Halter often waits upon the Brave; The Coward Soul as oft is made a Slave. [flies up. Bav. The Oracle for War declares, 'tis plain, A mean Submission rivets on our Chain. Harlequin makes Signs of hanging and quarteringâthey all shake their Heads. Ha! do you shake your Heads, and can you falter, Can Love of Life your Resolutions alter; Or can you fear the Hangman's Knife or Halter. Reflect, my Friends, Gin is the noble Cause For which your Swords shou'd hew away the Laws, Wipe out the Senate, drench in Blood the Nation, And spread o're all the State wild DesolatÃ¯on: But if your Swords are blunted by your Fear, I'll singly in the glorious Cause appear. Enter a Constable with a Proclamation in his Hand, Harlequin makes him a great many Compliments in Dumb shew.â Constable. Of this your Meeting having had Relation, I'me come to read to all, the Proclamation. And if you don't, as order'd, strait retire, I'll bring the Guards, and order them to fire. I fear some Treason hatching 'gainst the State, So shall not long your Resolution wait. Scrub. I my Obedience in retiring shew, Let the Brave stay, but let the prudent go.â [Exit. Bav. I value not your Threats of Guards and fire, But in Obedience to the Laws retire.â [Exit. Funk. All Men of Sense, impending Danger shun, What signifies my stay, I am but one.â [Exit. Tunn. Let us, my Friends, all quietly go Home, Omnes. Ay, ay, that's bestâ Constable. âAway then clear the Room. [Exeunt all before the Constable. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Suppos'd to be spoken by a Woman. You'll think, perhaps, I'm thro' good Nature come T'excuse our Author, and avert his Doom; Hang him; 'tis no such Matter, I assure ye; Criticks, I leave the Scribler to your Fury: But, I forewarn you, e're you loose your Rage, That a whole Nest of Hornets you engage! For tho' on him, alone, you make th'Attack, You'll bring his Brethren all, upon your Back: They, one and all, will stand in the Defence Of Freedom, 'gainst the Tyranny of Sense; They've knock'd the Shackles off, of Place and Time, And in their Songs, alone, are tied to Rhime; The Towns Indulgence, gives their Genius Scope, And all now write like any Thing, butâPope. He dares not taste the Sweets of being Free, And Sweats in Chains of Probability; But he's a Wretch of very small Discerning, Fond of good Sense, and antiquated Learning: For which he's damn'd by all the Brethren round Who've brought the Art of PhÅbus, to meer Sound. With son'rous Words they arm the Tragick Whiners, But leave the Burthen of the Plot to Joyners. Perhaps they'll say Expence of Thought is waste, Yours is the Blaim; your vitiated Taste, With Buffoonry is pleas'd, with gaudy Scenes, With Flambeaux, Crackers, Giants and Machines: That while old Plays which quite are Thread-bare worn, Or Conjureing Harlequins, will serve your Turn; While Managers can absolutely Rule, The Chance stands equal with the Wit and Fool: For while the Masters reign with Pow'r despotick, While Rules of Art, to them, are Plants exotick, While those, who scarce can read do Judges sit Of what is Humour, Elegance, or Wit, No Wonder if Bombast, and son'rous Rhime, Usurp the Stage; or that the true Sublime, Rejected, mold'ring in a Coffer lies, Or sold to Pastry-Cooks, it bottoms Pies: No wonder Wit gives place to Ribaldry, And Humour yields to Love in Hollow Tree. This is their Plea; do you the Ground remove, Explode what's Mountebanck, what's good Approve; Shew that we live in a discerning Age, And bid good Sense resume again the Stage. FINIS.</field>
