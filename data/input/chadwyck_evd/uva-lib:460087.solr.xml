      <field name="fulltext">There are some scenes, and some passages, that were always omitted in the representation, as may be seen in page 53, 54, 55, 56, and 58; but are here printed, that the reader may have it as it was originally written.ALFRED: A MASQUE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alfred, a Masque, was written by Mr. Thompson, in conjunction with Mr. Mallet, at the request of his Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales, and was performed at Cliffden-House, before their Royal Highnesses, on the first of August, 1740. Ten years after it was adapted for the stage by Mr. Mallet, and was received with great applause. Mr. Mallet, in his advertisement (after giving an account of his joining with Mr. Thompson in the performance) goes onââBut to fit it for the stage, I found it would be necessary to new plan the whole, as well as write the particular scenes over again; to enlarge the design, and make Alfred what he should have been at first, the principal figure in his own Masque. This I have done; but, according to the present arrangement of the fable, I was obliged to reject a great deal of what I had written in the other, neither could I retain of my friend's part, more than three or four single speeches, and a part of one song; I mention this expresly, that whatever faults are found in the present performance, they may be charged, as they ought to be, entirely to my account.â D. Mallet. It is now revived with some few alterations, and with some New Music; the favourite airs of Dr. Arne, as they stood in the Masque altered by Mallet, are reserved; there are some few alterations, which are now published.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. After the Danes had made themselves masters of Chippenham, the strongest city in the kingdom of Wessex, Alfred was at once abandoned by all his subjects; in this universal defection, that monarch found himself obliged to retire into the little isle of Athelney in Somersetshireâthere, in the habit of a peasant, he liv'd unknown in a shepherd's cottageâhe is supposed to be found in this retreat by the Earl of Devon, whose castle upon the river Tau was then besieged by the Danes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, By a FRIEND. Spoken by Mr. GARRICK, When it was first Acted. In arms renown'd, for arts of peace ador'd, Alfred, the nation's father, more than lord, A British author has presum'd to draw, Struck deep, even now, with reverential awe; And sets the Godlike figure fair in viewâ O may discernment find the likeness true. When Danish fury, with wide-wasting hand, Had spread pale fear, and ravage o'er the land, This prince arising bade confusion cease, Bade order shine, and blest his isle with peace; Taught liberal arts to humanize the mind, And heaven-born science to sweet freedom join'd. United thus, the friendly sisters shone, And one secur'd, while one adorn'd his throne. Amidst these honors of his happy reign, Each Grace and every Muse compos'd his train: As grateful servants, all exulting strove, At once to spread his fame, and share his love. To night, if aught of fiction you behold, Think not in Virtue's cause, the bard too bold. If ever angels from the skies descend, It must beâtruth and freedom to defend. Thus would our author pleaseâbe it your part, If not his labors, to approve his heart. True to his country's, and to honor's cause, He fixes, there, his fame, and your applause; Wishes no failing from your sight to hide, But, by free Britons, will be freely try'd.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A NEW OVERTURE. ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE a rural Prospect, with the Cottage of Corin and Emma. Emma Sings. I. If those who live in shepherd's bower, Press not the rich and stately bed: The new-mown hay and breathing flower, A softer couch beneath them spread. II. If those who sit at shepherd's board, Sooth not their taste by wanton art; They take what nature's gifts afford, And take it with a chearful heart. Emma, comming forward. Corin! Corin! 'tis he. Against yon aged oak, Pensive and lost in thought, he leans his head. Corin. Soft: let us not disturb him. Gentle Emma, Poor tho he be, unfriended and unknown, My pity waits with reverence on his fortune. Modest of carriage, and of speech most gracious, As if some saint or angel in disguise Had grac'd our lowly cottage with his presence, He steals, I know not how, into the heart, And makes it part to serve him. Trust me, Emma, He is no common man. Emma. Some lord, perhaps, Or valiant chief, that from our deadly foe, The haughty, cruel, unbelieving Dane, Seeks shelter here. Corin. And shelter he shall find: Who loves his country, is my friend and brother. Behold him well. Fair manhood in its prime, Even thro the homely russet that conceals him, Shines forths and proves him noble. Emma, 'Tis most like, He is not what his present fortunes speak him. But, ah! th'inhuman foe is all around us; We dare not keep him here. Corin. Thou hast not weigh'd This island's force the deep defence of woods, Nature's own hand hath planted strong around; The rough encumbrance of perplexing thorns, Of intertwining brakes that rise between, And choak up every inlet from abroad. Yet more; thou know'st, beyond this woody verge Two rivers broad and rapid hem us in; Along whose border spreads the gulphy pool, And trembling quagmire to betray the foot Its treacherous greensword tempts. One path alone Winds to this plain, so difficult and so strait, My single arm, against a band of foes, Could long, perhaps, defend it. Emma. Yet, my Corin, Revolve the stern decree of that fierce tyrant, The Danish king: âWho harbours, or relieves âAn English captain, dies the death of traitors: âBut who their haunts discovers, shall be safe, âAnd high rewarded.â Corin. Now, just heaven forbid, An Englishman should ever count for gain What villainy must earn. No: are we poor? Be honesty our riches. Are we mean, And humbly born? The true heart makes us noble. These hands can toil; can sow the ground and reap For thee and thy sweet babes. Our daily labour Is daily wealth: it finds us bread and raiment. Could Danish gold give more? I. Though to a desart isle confin'd, In humble poverty we live, The honest heart, the virtuous mind, Are riches, splendor cannot give. II. These hands inur'd to daily toil, Can sow the ground, can plough and reap, And shall improve the gen'rous soil, Thee and thy lovely babes to keep. Emma. Alas the while! That loyal faith is fled from hall and bower, To dwell with village swains, Corin. Ah look! behold, Where Edith, all-abandon'd to despair, Hangs weeping o'er the brook. Edith approaches slowly to soft music. She sings. I. A youth adorn'd with every art, To warm and win the coldest heart, In secret mine possest; The morning bud that fairest blows, The vernal oak that straitest grows, His face and shape exprest. II. In moving sounds he told his tale; Soft as the sighings of the gale, That wakes the flowery year: What wonder he cou'd charm with ease! Whom happy nature form'd to please, Whom love had made sincere. III. At morn he left me;âfought, and fell; The fatal evening heard his knell, And saw the tears I shed; Tears that must ever, ever fall; For ah! no sighs the past recall, No cries awake the dead! Corin. Unhappy maid! yet not alone in woe; For look, where our sad guest, like some fair tree Torn from the root by winter's cruel blast, Lies on the ground o'erthrown. Emma. I weep, to see it! Corin. Thou hast a heart sweet pity loves to dwell in: But, dry thy tears, and lean on this just hopeâ If yet to do away his country's shame, To serve her bravely on some blest occasion; If for these ends this stranger sought our cottage, The heavenly hosts are hovering here unseen, To watch and to protect him.âBut oh! when (My heart burns for it) shall I see the hour Of vengeance on these Danish infidels, That war with heaven and us? Emma. Alas, my love! These passions are not for the poor man's state, To heaven and to the rulers of the land Leave such ambitious thoughts; be warned, my Corin; And think our little all depends on thee. O Peace! the fairest child of heaven, To whom the sylvan reign was given; The vale, the fountain and the grove, With every softer scene of love: Return, sweet Peace! to chear the weeping swain, Return, with Ease and Pleasure in thy train. Corin. Hush! cease thy songâfor see our mournful guest Has raised his head, and lo! who comes to greet him; His friend, the woodman of the neighbouring dale, Whom late, as yester-evening star arose, At his request I found, and hither brought: Let us retire and leave them to confer. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Alfred, Earl of Devon. Alfred. How long, just heaven! how long Shall war's fell ravage desolate this land? All, all is lostâand Alfred lives to tell it! Are these things so? and he without the means Of great revenge? cast down below the hope Of succouring those he weeps for? Devon. Gracious Alfred, England's last hope, whose feeling goodness shews What angels are; to bear, with such a prince, The worst of ills, exile, or chains, or death, Is happiness, is glory. Alfred. Ah! look round theeâ That mud-built cottage is thy sovereign's palace. Yon hind, whose daily toil is all his wealth, Lodges and feeds him. Are these times for flattery? Or call it praise: such gaudy attributes Would misbecome our best and proudest fortunes. But what are mine? What is this high-priz'd Alfred? Among ten thousand wretches most undone! That prince who sees his country laid in ruins, His subjects perishing beneath the sword Of foreign war; who sees and cannot save them, Is but supreme in misery!âBut on, Proceed, my lord; compleat the mournful tale, My griefs broke off. Devon. From yonder heath-clad hill, Far as my straining eye could shoot it's beam I look'd, and saw the progress of the foe, As of some tempest, some devouring tide, That ruins, without mercy, where it spreads. The riches of the year, the bread of thousands That liberal crown'd our plains from vale to hill, With intermingled forests, temples, towers, Now smoak to heaven, one broad-ascending cloud. But oh for pity! on each mountain's height, Shivering and sad the pale inhabitants, Gray-headed age and youth, all stood and mark'd This boundless ravage: motionless and mute, With hands to heaven up-rais'd, they stood and weptâ My tears attended theirsâ Alfred. If this sad sight Could pain thee to such anguish, what must I Their king and parent feel? Devon. Sir, be of comfort. Who has not known ill fortune, never knew Himself, or his own virtue. Alfred. Wellâno moreâ Complaint is for the vulgar: kings must act; Restore a ruin'd state, or perish with it. Despair shall be our strengthâ Devon. Behold, my lord, From yonder hazle copse, who issues forth, And moves this wayâa strangerâbut his look Speaks haste and apprehensionâ Alfred. Ha! beyond My utmost hope!â'Tis Edwinâ SCENE III. Alfred, Devon, Edwin. Alfred. Hast thou ought Of joyful to impart? or is the soul Of England dead indeed? Edwin. My gracious master, This journey has been fruitful to our wish. Awak'd, as from the last and mortal trance, That soul, which seem'd extinguish'd, lives again. By me assur'd, their sovereign still survives, Survives to take due vengeance on those robbers, Who violate the sanctity of leagues, The reverend seal of oaths; who basely broke, Like midnight ruffians, on the hour of peace, And stole a victory from men unarm'd; Of this assur'd, your people breathe once more. The spirit of our ancestors is up! The spirit of the free! and, with one voice Of happy omen, all demand their king. Alfred. Then, heaven who knows our wrongs will deign to guide The virtue it inspiresâMy lord, how sound These tidings in your ears? Devon. As the sure omen Of better fate, my heart receives and hails them. For know, my liege, the fury of those Danes, This last dire scene of total desolation, Will kindle up the flame to seven-fold fierceness; New-wing each shaft, edge every lifted sword, And driveâ Alfred. A momentâEdwin, yet inform me What numbers have you gather'd? how dispos'd, Where posted them? Edwin. In these surrounding woods, Soon as the shade of night descends to veil them, A generous few, the veteran hardy gleanings Of many a well-fought field, all at one hour, Behind the rushy brook from hence due east, By different paths, and in small parties meet, Accoutred at all points: and, as I judge, Their numbers count twelve hundred. Alfred. Ha! twelve hundredâ Incredibleâsoftâlet me duly weigh What I, unhoping, scarce believing, hear. Something must, now, be doneâAy, that attempt Is greatâbut greatly hazardousâwhy then, Necessity, our just plea, must excuse The desperate daring her hard law imposes. Hear, my brave friends. One castle still is ours, Tho close begirt and shaken by the Danes. Devon, speed thither: find out that close path, By Edwin's eye and aid, which from the midst, The central point of Kinwith-forest winds In deep descent; and, under ground prolong'd, Safe in the fortress ends. Devon. Suppose me there: What follows this, my lord? Alfred. Be it your part To animate our brothers of the war, Those Englishmen, who yet deserve that name. The foeâdwell much on thisâby our known weakness Made daring and secure, will now the rein Of discipline relax, and to loose revel Indulge the midnight hour. Therefore, at threeâ O count the clock with more than lovers' vigilanceâ At three, that chosen band shall from behind, Rising at once, with Alfred at their head, Assail the hostile camp: while your warm sally, That very moment, pours upon it's front. Hence: and success be thine. Devon. On this our purpose, The sacred cause of liberty and vengeance, Smile, righteous heaven! Alfred. O urge it home, my friend, That each man's sword now wears upon it's point The present age, and last posterity! Farewell. Edwin, within the hour return, And find me here. SCENE IV. Alfred. Ha! day declines apace. What anxious thoughts, in this wild solitude, My darker hours must know? And now, the veil Of evening, o'er these murmuring woods around, A lonely horror spreadsâBut soft: the breeze Is dumb! and more than midnight silence reigns! Why beats my bosom!âMusic! Shield me, heaven! Whence should it come?âHark!ânow the measur'd strains, In awful sweetness warbling, strike my sense, As if some wing'd musician of the sky Touch'd his ethereal harp. SCENE V. Solemn music is heard at a distance. It comes nearer in a full symphony: after which a single trumpet sounds a high and awakening air. Then the following stanzas are sung by two aÃ«real Spirits. First Spirit. Hear, Alfred, father of the state, Thy genius heaven's high will declare! What proves the hero truly great, Is never, never to despair. Both Spirits. Is never to despair. Second Spirit. Thy hope awake, thy heart expand With all its vigour, all its fires: Arise, and save a sinking land! Thy country calls and heaven inspires. Both Spirits. Earth calls and heaven inspires. SCENE VI. Alfred. Am I awake! and is it no illusion That heaven thus deigns to look with mercy on me? Thus, by his ministers, to chear my heart, And warm it into hope? But lo! he comes, Whom angels deign to visit and inspire, The holy sage, descending from his cell In yon hill's cavern'd side: sweet sylvan scene Where shade and silence dwell! SCENE VII. Alfred, Hermit. Alfred. Thrice happy Hermit! Whom thus the heavenly habitants attend, Blessing thy calm retreat; while ruthless war Fills the polluted land with blood and crimes. In this extremity of England's fate, Led by thy sacred character, I come For comfort and advice. Bay what remains, What yet remains to save our prostrate country? Nor scorn this anxious question even from me, A nameless stranger. Hermit. Alfred, England's king, All hail, and welcome to this humble cell. Alfred. Amazement!âby these humble weeds obscur'd, I deem'd my state beyond discovery's reach: How is it then to thee alone reveal'd? Hermit. Last night, when with a draught from that cool fountain I had my wholesome sober supper crown'd; As is my stated custom, forth I walk'd Beneath the solemn gloom and glittering sky, To feed my soul with prayer and meditation. And thus to inward harmony compos'd, That sweetest music of the grateful heart, Whose each emotion is a silent hymn, I to my couch retir'd. Strait on mine eyes A pleasing slumber fell, whose mystic power Seal'd up my senses, but enlarg'd my soul. Led by those spirits, who disclose futurity, I liv'd thro distant ages; felt tho virtue, The great, the glorious passions that will fire Remote posterity; when guardian laws Are by the patriot, in the glowing senate, Won from corruption; when th'impatient arm Of liberty, invincible, shall scourge The tyrants of mankindâand when the deep, Thro all her swelling waves, from pole to pole Shall spread the boundless empire of thy sons. I saw thee, Alfred, tooâBut o'er thy fortunes Lay clouds impenetrable. Alfred. To heaven's will, In either fortune, mine shall ever bend With humblest resignationâYet, O say, Does that unerring Providence, whose justice Has bow'd me to the dust; whose ministers, Sword, fire and famine, scourge this sinful land, This tomb of it's inhabitantsâdoes he Reserve me in his hand, the glorious instrument From fierce oppression to redeem my country? Hermit. What mortal eye, by his immediate beam Not yet enlighten'd, dare presume to look Thro time's abyss? But should the flatterer, hope, Anticipating see that happy time, Those whiter momentsâPrince, remember, then, The noble lessons by affliction taught: Preserve the quick humanity it gives, The pitying social sense of human weakness; Yet keep thy generous fortitude entire, The manly heart, that to another's woe Is tender, as superiour to it's own. Learn to submit: yet learn to conquer fortune. Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds And offices of life: to life itself, With all it's vain and transient joys, sit loose. Chief, let devotion to the sovereign Mind, A steady, chearful, absolute dependance On his best wisest government, possess thee. Alfred. I thank thee, father; and O witness, heaven, Whose eye the heart's profoundest depth explores! That if not to perform my regal task; To be the common father of my people, Patron of honor, virtue and religion; If not to shelter useful worth, to guard His well-earn'd portion from the sons of rapine, And deal out justice with impartial hand; If not to spread, on all good men, thy bounty, The treasures trusted to me, not my own; If not to raise anew our English name, By peaceful arts that grace the land they bless, And generous war to humble proud oppressors: Yet more; if not to build the public weal, On that firm base which can alone resist Both time and chance, on liberty and law; If I for these great ends am not ordain'dâ May I ne'er poorly fill the throne of England! Hermit. Still may thy breast these sentiments retain, In prosperous life. Alfred. Could it destroy or change Such thoughts as these, prosperity were ruin. Two Spirits sing the following hymn. First. O joy of joys, to lighten woe! Best pleasure, pleasure to bestow! What raptures then his heart expand, Who lives to bless a grateful land. Second Spirit. For him, ten thousand bosoms beat; His name consenting crouds repeat: From soul to soul the passion runs, And subjects kindle into sons. Hermit. Alfred, once moreâsince favour'd thus of heaven, Since thus to cheer thee and confirm thy virtue He sends his angels forthâremember well, Should better days restore thy prosperous fortunes, The vows these awful beings hear thee make: Remember and fulfil them. Alfred. O no moreâ When those whom heaven distinguishes o'er millions, And showers profusely power and splendor on them, Whate'er th'expanded heart can wish; when they, Accepting the reward, neglect the duty, Or worse, pervert those gifts to deeds of ruin, Is there a wretch they rule so base as they? Guilty, at once, of sacrilege to heaven! And of perfidious robbery to man! Hermit. Such thoughts become a monarchâbut behold, The glimmering dusk, involving air and sky, Creeps slow and solemn on. Devotion now, With eye enraptur'd, as the kindling stars Light, one by one, all heaven into a glow Of living fire, adores the Hand divine, Who form'd their orbs and pour'd forth glory on them. Alfred. Then, this good moment, snatch'd from earth's affairs, Let us employ aright: and, in you cell, To Him, with heart sincere, our homage pay, Who glorious spreads and gracious shuts the day. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Emma, and other Peasants. Wish'd evening now is come: but her soft hour, Close of our daily toil, that wont to sound Sweet with the shepherd's pipe and virgin's voice, Is chearless all and mute. Second Shepherdess. Heaven's will be ours. And since no grief can yesterday recall, Nor change tomorrow's face; now let us soothe The present as we may with dance and song, To lighten sad remembrance. First Shepherdess sings. I. The shepherd's plain life, Without guilt, without strife, Can only true blessings impart. As nature directs, That bliss he expects From health and from quiet of heart. II. Vain grandeur and power, Those toys of an hour, Tho mortals are toiling to find; Can titles or show Contentment bestow? All happiness dwells in the mind. III. Behold the gay rose, How lovely it grows, Secure in the depth of the vale, Yon oak, that on high Aspires to the sky, Both lightning and tempest assail. IV. Then let us the snare Of Ambition beware, That source of vexation and smart: And sport on the glade, Or repose in the shade, With health and with quiet of heart. Here a pastoral dance. SCENE II. Corin, Emma, Peasants. Corin. O happy hour! wife, neighboursâsuch, such news! I shall run wild with joy! Emma. Speak, shepherd; say, What moves thee thus? Corin. The king is in our isle! Emma. Can it be possible? Peasant. What do I hear? Corin. As now I pass'd beneath the hermit's cell, I heard that wonderous man pronounce his name. O Emma, the poor stranger whom we serv'd And honour'd, all-unknowing of his state, Is he! our great and gracious Alfred! All. Heaven! Then are we blest indeed! Corin. My humble cottage, Long ages hence, when we are dust, my friends, In holy pilgrimage oft visited, Will draw true English knees to worship there, As at the shrine of some propitious saint, Or angel friendly to mankindâThe thought Brings tears into mine eyes.â Emma. Does joy deceive My sense? or did I hear a distant voice Sigh thro the vale and wake the mournful echo? The following song is sung by a person unseen. I. Sweet valley! say, where pensive lying, For me, our children, England, sighing, The best of mortals leans his head: Ye fountains! dimpled by my sorrow; Ye brooks! that my complaining borrow, O lead me to his lonely bed! Or if my lover, Deep woods ye cover, Ah! whisper where your shadows o'er him spread. II. This stanza is omitted in the representation.'Tis not the loss of pomp and pleasure, Of empire, or of tinsel treasure, That drops the tear, that swells the groan; No, from a nobler cause proceeding, A heart with love and fondness bleeding, I breathe my sadly pleasing moan; With other anguish, I scorn to languish. For love will feel no sorrow but his own. Corin. What think ye, friends? Such moving, melting softness Breathes in these sweet complainings, as till now Mine ear was never blest with. Let us go And find out this new wonder. Second Shepherdess. Look, the king! Emma. Now, by my holidame, a goodly person, And of most noble mein. Corin. Disturb him not. SCENE III. Alfred, Hermit. Hermit. Your enterprise is boldâand may be fatal: Yet I condemn it not. All is not rashness, That valor of more common size might think, And caution term so. Souls of nobler scope, Whose comprehensive sight beholds at once And weighs the sum of things, are their own rule, And to be judg'd but by themselves alone. Alfred. Then, in the name of that inspiring Power, Whose deputy I am, who sends me forth His minister of vengeance, on I go To victory, or death. [As he is going out, he stops short. What do I feel? Save me! a holy horror stirs my frame, And shivers thro each veinâWhat shapes are these, Athwart the gloom, that strike my dazled sense? Betwixt and where yon mist along the marsh Rowls blue it's vapoury wave, some unseen hand Pourtrays in air the visionary scene Distinct and full, in brighter colors drawn Than summer suns reflect on evening cloud, When all it's fluid bosom glows with goldâ And now, it reddens into blood! Hermit, who had observed him fixedly, half-aside. Ere night Withdraws her shade, new accidents and strange Will shake this island's peace. [To him. Now, Alfred, now, Be all the hero shewn. Alfred. What may this mean? SCENE IV. Alfred, Corin. Corin, kneeling. My honor'd sovereignâ Alfred. How is this! ha! what! Discover'd by this peasantâBe it so: The plain man is most loyal. Corin. England's wealth, The pearly stores her circling seas contain, Should never shake your Corin's faithâ Alfred. But what Alarms thee thus? Corin. My fears are for my king. Some strangers, Sirâtheir habits speak them Danesâ Have found our isle. Look this way. Alfred. Be of courage. Now, I perceive them. Thro the evening shade Their armor gleams a faint and moving light. Westward they turn, and strike into the path That opens on this plain. Retire we, shepherd, Behind yon dusky elm; from whence, unseen, We may discern their numbers and their purpose. SCENE V. Danes passing along. First Dane. No more. 'Twas she: I could not be deceiv'd. A lover's eye in as the eagle's sharp, And kens his prey from farâBut list a while, If sound of human voice, or bleat of flocks May guide our lost enquiry thro this wild. Second Dane. No: all is loneliness around, and hush'd As our dead northern wastes at midnight hour. Our gods protect us! Prince, it was most rash, So few our numbers, at this close of day Headlong to plunge amid these horrid shades, Where danger lurks unseen. First Dane. How! know'st thou not That England is no more? Her sons of war, To dens and caverns fled, like fearful hares Sit trembling at each blast the chill wind blows. Her king himself or sleeps in dust, or roams Wild on the pathless mountain. As for me; Our country gods, those spirits that possess The boundless wilderness, that love to dwell With dreary solitude and night profound, Will guard the son of Ivar, to whose house Their vassalage is bound by magic spell. Come on. She must be found, this unknown fair Who fir'd me at first view; and rages still A fever in my youthful blood. Away. SCENE VI. Alfred, Corin, advancing. Corin. They are but three. Alfred. And were that number trebled, This island is their grave; this sacred spot, Fair freedom's last retreat. We must, we will Preserve it, all-inviolate and holy, From impious infidels: or, with our blood, If now we perish, sanctify it's earth For after-times to visit and revere. Corin. List, list, my lordâ Alfred. What noise was that?âBy heaven, The shrieks of women! Now, stern vengeance guide The sword we draw. SCENE VII. Emma, and other peasants. Emma. Ah, whither shall we fly? Immortal virgin! queen of mercy! save usâ See, see, my friends, they seize the lovely strangerâ They bear her offâBehold the king appearsâ My husband tooâNow, heaven, defend alike The mighty and the mean, the prince and peasant! Two of them fall beneath our monarch's armâ The third, my CorinâO I dare no more Look that wayâYet I mustâThe third is slain! O gallant shepherd! O most happy hour! SCENE VIII. Alfred, Corin, supporting the lady. Alfred. This way, bravo shepherd, from these closer shadesâ Here the free air and breezy glade will rouse Her fainting spiritsâSoâWho may she be? Perhaps, some worthy heart at this sad moment Akes for her safety. Eltruda. Save me, save me, heaven! Alfred. Ye powers! what do I hear?âYesâyesâ'tis she! My wife, my queen! the treasure of my soul! Eltruda. My Alfred! Alfred. My Eltruda! Eltruda. Can it be? Or is it all th'illusion of my fear? O no: 'tis heâmy lord! my life! my husband! My guardian angel Alfred. Alfred. My Eltruda! Black horror chills me while I view the brink, The dreadful precipice, on which we stoodâ And was it thee I rescu'd from these ruffiansâ O Providence amazing!âthee, Eltruda! Eltruda. I tremble still!âfrom worse than death deliver'd! And am I then secure in Alfred's arms? Alfred. There let me hold thee; lull thy fears to rest: There hush thy soul with everlasting fondness. The panting bird so flutters, just escap'd The fowler's snare. Eltruda. My heart, my heart is fullâ And must o'erflow in tears. A thousand thoughts Are busy hereâThat ever we should meet In such a dire extremity!âAh me! That ever Alfred's family and children Should need tho shelter of his single arm! Alfred. My children!âwhere, where are they? Eltruda. Turn thine eyes To yonder cottage: there conceal'dâ Alfred. My Corin, Fly, bring them to my arms. But say, my love, Why didst thou leave the convent, where I plac'd thee? Why, unprotected, trust thee to a land, A barbarous land, where violence inhabits? Our hospitable England is no more. Eltruda. Alas! my Alfred, even the peaceful cells, Where safe beneath religion's holy veil Her cloister'd votaries dwelt, from impious Danes No reverence claim. The villages around, Dispers'd and flying wild before their arms, Inform'd us, a near party, on whose course Destruction waits, were marching full to us. Instant I fled. Two faithful servants bore Our children off: and heaven has sav'd us all! Alfred. O welcome to my soul!âO happy Alfred! Thus to have rescu'd what the feeling heart Most dear and precious holds, from men who war With earth and heaven. Eltruda. Tho terrible at first, Blest be the tempest that has driven me hither, Into this safe, this sacred harbor! Alfred. Come, O come, and here repose thee from the storm, Within these sheltering arms. Eltruda, holding him off. Yetâlet me view theeâ My king and husbandâdo I find thee thus? [falling into his arms. Unknown! unserv'd! unhonor'd! none to tend thee! To soothe thy woes, to watch thy broken slumbers, With every fonder service, pious love Best knows to pay!âThere is in love a power, There is a soft divinity that draws, Even from distress, those transports that delight The breast they pain, and it's best powers exalt Above all taste of joys from vulgar life! Alfred. O 'tis too muchâthou all that makes life glorious! Nay look not on me with this sweet dejection; Thro tears that pierce the soulâ My children too! My little ones! Come to your sire's embrace: 'Tis all he can bestowâIn them behold What human grandeur isâThe peasant's offspring Have some retreat, some safe, tho lowly home: But you, my babes, you have no habitation! With pain and peril wandering thro a land, A ruin'd country you were born to rule! The thought unmans my reason. SCENE IX. Alfred, Eltruda, Hermit. Hermit. I have heard Thy fond complainings, Alfred. Alfred. You have then, Good father, heard the cause that wrings them from me. Hermit. The human race are sons of sorrow born: And each must have his portion. Vulgar minds Refuse, or crouch beneath their load: the brave Bear theirs without repining. Alfred. Who can bear The shaft that wounds him thro an infant's side? When whom we love, to whom we owe protection, Implore the hand we cannot reach to save them. Hermit. Weep not, Eltruda.âYet, thou art a king; All private passions fall before that name. Thy subjects claim thee whole. Alfred. Can public trust, O reverend sage! destroy the softer ties That twine around the parent's yearning heart? This holy passion heaven itself infus'd, And blended with the stream that feeds our life. All nature feels it intimate and deep, And all her sons of instinct and of reason. Hermit. Then shew that passion in it's noblest form. Think what a task it is, to rear those minds, On whom the fate of millions, general bliss, Or universal misery, depends. Alfred. That task then, difficult alike and noble, Be thine, O sacred sage; to whose try'd wisdom I, henceforth, solely trust their tender years. Let truth and virtue be their earliest teachers. Keep from their ear the syren-voice of flattery; Keep from their eye the harlot-form of vice, Who spread, in every court, their silken snares, And charm but to betray. Betimes instruct them, Superior rank demands superior worth; Pre-eminence of valor, justice, mercy: But chief, that tho exalted o'er mankind, They are themselves but menâfrail suffering dust; From no one injury of human lot Exempt: but fever'd by the same heat, chill'd By the same cold, torn by the same disease, That scorches, freezes, racks, and kills the beggar. Should fairer days, returning, smile again On England and on meâ Ha! Edwin here? This way, my friendâspeak softlyâ Edwin whispers the king aside. How!â'tis well!â Back to thy post: I follow on the instantâ Yet stayâBehold my queen, and infant-sons! Edwinâthy king's whole wealth is there summ'd up! Nay, wipe thine eyes; and tell my gallant friends What thou hast seen. The tale will lend new force To each man's arm, and with redoubled weight Urge every well-aim'd blow, Hence! speed thee well. Eltrudaâwe must partâ Eltruda. What do I hear? My life, my loveâ Alfred. Part for a few sad moments, That our next meeting may be long and happy. Eltruda. What leave me now? O my presaging heart! Already leave me! 'Tis the dreadful call Of glory, somewhat perilously great, And big with urgent haste, that tears thee from me. Oh Alfredâ Alfred. No fond weakness now be shewn, Eltruda, no distrust of virtue's fate. Thou and thy children are, at present, safe In this wise Hermit's care. For what remains; My cause is just, my fortune in His hand Who reigns supreme, almighty and all-good. Translated from Racine's Athalie. Celui, qui met un frein Ã  la fureur des flots, SÃ§ait aussi des mÃ©chans arrester les complots. SoÃ»mis avec respect Ã  sa volontÃ© sainte, Je crains Dieu, cher Abner, &amp; n'ay point d'autre crainte. That Power who stills the raging of the main, The rage of all our foes can render vain. To his unerring will resign'd sincere, I fear that God, and know no other fear! End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Emma, and other shepherdesses. Emma. Yes, Edith, we will watch, till morning shines, Around this cottage, now made rich and gloriousâ Who durst have thought such wonders?âby a queen, And her bright offspring! Thou, mean while, invoke, With sounds of soothing strain, the gentle sleep To pour his timely vapours on their eye-lids. Edith sings. I. In cooling stream, O sweet repose, Those balmy dews distill, That steal the mourner from his woes, And bid despair be still. II. Prolong the smiling infant's rest, Who yet no sorrow knows: But O the mother's bleeding breast To softest peace compose! III. For her the fairest dreams adorn, That wave on fancy's wing; The purple of ascending morn, The bloom of opening spring. IV. Let all, that soothes the soul or charms, Her midnight hour employ; Till blest again in Alfred's arms, She wakes to real joy. Emma. Alas! she comes. Let us withdraw, my friends. Her sorrows claim all reverence: and 'tis meet We leave her to herself. SCENE II. Eltruda. Amid the depth of this surrounding gloom, While nature all is hush'd, Eltruda wakes To thinkâand to be wretched. Oh my love! My heart's sole rest and refuge! Where is he! Victor or vanquish'dâwhat is now his fate? Moments of terrorâHa! what noise was that? Each sound appals me, and each thought is death! 'Twas more than fancy sure: it seem'd the groan Of bleeding menâO every guardian wing Of saints and angels shield him! from his breast Turn wide the flying shaft, the lifted steel, And, sheltering him, a ruin'd nation save. Who comes? Speak, quickly speak. SCENE III. Eltruda, an Attendant. Attendant. My gracious mistress, Why to the breath of this untimely sky Expose your health? Eltruda. Awayâthe health, the life Of England is at stake: my Alfred fightsâ Perhaps he bleeds: and I am lost for ever! But is there none, no messenger return'd From that dark scene of death? Attendant. No, madam, none. Enter Emma. Eltruda. My kind hostess, thou hast an angel's voice, Come raise my drooping spirits, charm my mind With music's animating voice, and give Some respite to my woes. Emma sings. Restore, good heav'n, our virtuous king! To chase this gloom that round us low'rs, As winter flies before the spring, Who spreads the smiling earth with flow'rs. He comes! before his rising ray, Despair and darkness fly away. Eltruda. Thy song, sweet flatterer of hope, suspended My affliction for a momentâbut it returns. Trumpets sound. Ha! hear'st thou notâthe trumpets distant voiceâ It speaks aloud and shakes the echoing woods. See, see, my Emma, what tidings it proclaims. [Exit Emma. Eltruda. O my torn, tortur'd heart! What is the hour? Attendant. By yon faint light, that glimmering steals along From east to north, I guess the morning near. Eltruda. Then all my hopes and fears suspended hang On this dread moment's wing. SCENE IV. Eltruda, Attendant, Emma. Emma. O mighty queen, They come, the murderers come. Protect us, heaven, [kneeling. Our husbands, and our infants, from their rage. Without thine aid we perish. Eltruda. O my soul! Why what a sight is this? A tyrant's eye Might melt with pity o'er it. Thou supreme, [kneeling. All-ruling arbiter of human fate! Whose universal family is nature, On Alfred, on his children, on his people, Look down with mercyâfor their cause is thine, And now, even now, deciding! Hermit, Eltruda, and others. Hermit. Glorious princess! This is indeed to reign. Comfort, great queen: It comes, it comes! the promis'd scene discloses! I see the Danish raven droop his wing; See England's genius soar again to heaven, And better days in white succession roll, Without a cloud between! The clouds break away; and on the edge of a rock, in full view, a spirit is seen amidst a blaze of light, who sings the following ODE. From those eternal regions bright, Where suns that never set in night, Diffuse the golden day; Where spring, unfading, pours around, O'er all the dew-impearled ground, Her thousand colors gay; The messenger of heaven's high King, I come; and happy tidings bring, To chear this drooping isle: Behold her cruel foes are fled! Behold fair freedom lifts the head, And all his children smile! The dawn, that now unveils her skies, See England's future glory rise: A better age is born! Then, let each voice of sprightly strain, Around from warbling hill and plain, Hail this triumphant morn! Grand Chorus. Then let each voice of sprightly strain, Around from warbling hill and plain, Hail this triumphant morn! SCENE VI. Eltruda, Hermit, Earl of Devon. Devon, kneeling. Success is oursâ Eltruda. The king, my lordâ Devon. Returns, Victorious and unhurt. Eltruda. Then, first, to heaven, For this best news I humbly bend the knee In grateful adoration.âNow proceed, My lord; and leave no circumstance untold Of this amazing night. Devon. Her misty shade Had now enclos'd us round; when, led secure By Edwin's eye, the darkest depth I reach'd Of Kinwith-wood. We parted.âHe, in haste, Back to his charge. I thro the cavern'd path, Whose inlet there is found, descending dark, Long, under ground, it's solitary maze Pursu'd as best I could; and rose at length Safe in the fort our foes had close begirt. 'Twas joy, 'twas rapture there, among the few Who wish'd, not hop'd, my unforeseen return. Eltruda. What follow'd this, my lord? Devon. Prepare, I cry'd, To live or die like men. Our king survives; And, now in arms, expects your instant aid. To him then let us cut our glorious way Thro yonder camp: or, if we nobly fall, There offer to the genius of our country Whole hecatombs of Danes.âAs if one soul Had mov'd them all, around their heads they whirl'd Their sounding faulchionsââLead us to those Danes: Revenge and Englandââwas the general cry. Eltruda. I feel it here: my heart applauds their virtue. How was this follow'd on? Devon. To souls resolv'd Small preparation needsâThe clock struck threeâ At once our gates flew wide: at once we rush'd Prone on the Danish trenchesâWhile behind, Just to the fatal instant, Alfred rose In all his terrors; o'er the mounded camp Tempestuous drove; from space to space along Spred slaughter and dismay. Nor rest, nor pause: Back'd by his ardent band, right on he bore Even to the tent, where sunk in sleep profound The Danish monarch lay. His guards, a few Whom honor prompted to defend their prince, Fell round him. He yet lives: but, O dire chance Of cruel war!âa prisoner and in chains. Eltruda. A fall how terrible! My breast is thrill'd, And in the fierce barbarian mourns the captive. Hermit. Such fortune ever wait on wild ambition! On war unjust that desolates whole nations, And leaves a world in tears for one man's guilt! But yetâfallen as he isâhe knows not yet What new distress, what keener pangs attend To wound his inmost heartâThat trumpet speaks The king's approachâYe ministers unseen! Spirits, whom the King of kings Gives to watch o'er human things, Hither, from each blest abode. From the morning's purple road; From the solar world of light; From the planet of the night; From the rainbow's evening-round; From the blue horizon's bound; Hither, borne thro seas of air, Sons of life and love repair! And now, with all that charms the eye, This monarch's triumph dignify. SCENE VII. To a grand flourish of instruments the scene, gradually opening, discovers several triumphal arches, adorned with trophies and garlands, and from space to space beautifully illuminated. The procession is led by shepherdesses, strewing flowers. First Shepherdess. Arise, sweet messenger of morn, With thy mild beam our skies adorn: For long as shepherds pipe and play, This, this shall be a holy-day. Second Shepherdess. See, morn appears; a rosy hue Steals soft o'er yonder orient blue: Soon let us meet in trim array, And frolic out this holy-day! These are followed by soldiers with palm branches in their hands. An officer behind bears the Danish standard. Flourish of instruments. First Voice. Swell the trumpet's boldest note! Second Voice. Let the drum it's thunders roll! Both. And, as on aery wings they float, Spread Alfred's name from pole to pole! Chorus. Our sons unborn, Still on this morn With annual joy shall tell; How by his might, In daring fight, The foes of England fell. Air. Prince, of every fame possest! Prince and patriot both confest! Thy grateful Albion shall to latest days Roll down thy glories in a tide of praise! Chorus. Thy grateful Albion shall to latest days Roll down thy glories in a tide of praise! Eltruda. Yon pictur'd ravenâtell me is it not Their wonderous magic standard! Devon. 'Tis the same: Wrought by the sisters of the Danish king, At midnight's blackest hour; when the sick moon, Wrapt in eclipse by their enchanting song, Down thro the turbid clouds her influence shed Of baleful power. The sisters ever sungâ âShake, standard, shake destruction on our foes.â SCENE VIII. Eltruda, Hermit, and the others. Alfred passing under the triumphal arches: The sun, at the same time, rising above the horizon. Eltruda. He comes! the conqueror comesâ Alfred. In these lov'd arms To lose all sorrow, and all bliss to find! Eltruda. O from what fears deliver'd for thy life, And in that life for a whole people's being, I thus receive thee back! thus fold thee safe! Love only, love like mine, can feel, not utter! Alfred. To Him ascend all praise! whose will inspir'd, Whose arm sustain'd this action, that restores My better nameâand, O more glorious still, Of nobler, dearer consequence!ârestores Lost England to her vigor, fame and freedom. Hermit. For her, O Alfred, your more arduous task But now begins: this conquest to secure; To spread it's influence wide, and, well improv'd By unremitting vigilance and valor, Make this one blow decisive of her fate. But now behold, to animate thy hope, In mystic shew express'd what late thy fortune Seem'd to portend; and what the brightening scene With fairer promise opens. Four Furies arise, to the sound of instruments in discord, at four different openings from under ground, with torches in their left hands, and bloody swords in their right. They form a confused Pyrrhic dance, shaking and pointing their swords and torches round the king in their centre: till, upon a change of the music into regular harmony, descends the Genius of England, with a crowned sword in one hand, and a lawrel wreathe in the other. On sight of whom the four Furies sink thro the openings they arose from. He presents the crowned sword and lawrel-branch at the feet of the king, and reascends, while the following song is sung. At last, at last, Our night is past, The gloomy night of fear: And o'er our skies Fair beams arise Of peace and joy sincere. Then let triumph abound! Let ecstacy reign! Till these hills all around,âaround Improving each strain, Our transports resound;âresound The heart-felt transport that succeeds to pain! Alfred. I hail th'auspicious omenâbut ah me! Eltruda, see, where comes th'unhappy king! Eltruda. Oh sight of woe! Alfred. Retire, my gentle love: An interview like this were too severe For thy soft nature. Eltruda. O my king, my Alfred! Now I see and hold thee thus, tho' my bliss Spring from his misery, my heart must bleed, For him, the king, the father, and the husband! Whose queen perhaps now feels those pangs I felt, When my distracted mind pictur'd my Alfred Lost to his people, children, and myself. [Exit Eltruda. SCENE IX. Alfred, Hermit, Danish King. Alfred, after a pause. See, at last, O king, In thy sad fate, which even a foe laments, See and acknowlege heaven's impartial hand. For violated oaths and plunder'd realms, For the heap'd guilt of base perfidious war, This retribution is most just. Dane. Awayâ I own no guilt: or kings of every age Are criminal, thy ancestors and mine. What is all war, but more diffusive robbery Made sacred by success? What object swells A monarch's highest aim?âincrease of power And universal sway. This glorious end All means must sanctify, that can secure. For what remainsâOf bondage, or of death, The lesser ill, I reek not. But, by Thor, The gloomy thunderer! one distracting thought Bends my soul's strongest temper; sinks me down Beneath my own contempt. Alfred. Such fears dismiss As must dishonor both. The truly brave His foe in equal arms will dare to meet: Vanquish'd, he dares not injure, not insult him. Dane. Nor that, nor ought without myself could thus Unman me. No: my hell is here, withinâ How! like a wretch, a nameless slave who fights But for vile hireâin my own tent surpris'd! Asleep! unarm'd!âthese shameful chains thrown o'er me, And not one blow exchang'd! O baser far Than that low herd, who fled without a wound Before thy sword.âThey but deserted him, Who first himself abandon'dâBut thy gods Were vigilant for thee: while mine all slept. Alfred. Your gods are idols: that sole Power I serve, Supreme and one, is universal Lord O'er earth and heaven. Be it my daily task, As 'tis my noblest theme, to own, by Him Alone I conquer'd: as for him alone I wish to reignâby making mankind blest! Dane. No moreâConvey me to your basest dungeon. Let me explore it's darkest depth; shut out The light of heaven; forget there is a sun Who shines on my dishonor. Would I might Exclude too my own thoughtsâBut yet, my son Livesâand is free! lives to revenge my fall! To wash my stains in bloodâHa! where was he This fatal night, when every god forsook me! Where, where was Ivar then? Hermit. Unhappy prince! That son, alas!â Dane. Ha! what! why, who art thou? What of my son? Hermit. Thy trust in him is vain. To his own rashness and intemperate lust, This very night, a victim, here, he fellâ Lo! where he lies. Dane. My sonâmy sonâHa! deadâ My only child!âBut no: I will not weep. Is he not safe, beyond misfortune's hand? Beyond all feeling of his father's shame? False hope, farewell!âLet madness, let despair Surround me, seize me whole; till life's loath'd flame, For ever quench'd in death, resigns me o'er To darkness and oblivion. Alfred. Dire reverse! Dreadful impatience!âBut these roving Danes A stricter watch demand. Means more effectual Must now be try'd, from our insulted shores To keep aloof this still-descending war. 'Tis naval strength, that must our peace assure. Be this the first high object of my care, To wall us round with well-appointed fleets. In them our sole dominion of the sea, Our wealth and grandeur, can alone be found, The one great bulwark of our separate world. Hermit. Alfred, go on; the noble task pursue, Thy safety urges, and thy fame demands. Yes, in her fleets, let England ever seek Her sure defence: by them, thro every age, At home secure, renown'd and fear'd abroad, Great arbitress of nationsâHa! the scene, The radiant prospect opens full before me! Thro distant depths of time transported down, I see whole moving forests, from her hills Uprooted, bound triumphant o'er the main! White tracks of glory brighten Albion's skies, As navies grow, as commerce swells her sail With every breeze that under heaven can blow, From either pole; thro worlds yet unexplor'd, In east and west, that to thy sons disclose Their golden stores, their wealth of various name, And lavish pour it on Britannia's lap! Alfred. Thy words new sun-shine thro my breast diffuse, And smiling calm. But let us, Hermit, try, By justice, mercy, arms and arts improv'd, By freedom fenc'd around with sacred laws, Our promis'd bliss to merit and adorn. Now, to my glorious taskâ Hermit. Yet ere you go, One moment, Alfred, backward cast your eyes On this unfolding scene; where, pictur'd true, As in a mirror, rises fair to sight Our England's genuine strength and future fame. Here is seen the ocean in prospect, and ships sailing along. Two boats land their crews. One sailor sings the following Ode: afterwhich, the rest join lively dance. I. When Britain first at heaven's command, Arose from out the azure main; This was the charter of the land, And guardian angels sung this strain: Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. II. The nations, not so blest as thee, Must in their turns to tyrants fall: While thou shalt flourish great and free, The dread and envy of them all. Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. III. Should war, should faction shake thy isle, And sink to poverty and shame; Heaven still shall on Britannia smile, Restore her wealth, and raise her name. Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. IV. As the loud blast, that tears thy skies, Serves but to root thy native oak; Still more majestic shalt thou rise, From foreign, from domestic stroke. Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. V. How blest the prince, reserv'd by fate, In adverse days to mount thy throne! Renew thy once triumphant state, And on thy grandeur build his own! Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. VI. His race shall long, in times to come, So heaven ordains, thy sceptre wield, Rever'd abroad, belov'd at home, And be, at once, thy sword and shield. Rule, Britannia, rule the waves: Britons never will be slaves. The End of the Masque.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First Shepherdess. Arise, sweet messenger of morn, With thy mild beam our skies adorn: For long as shepherds pipe and play, This, this shall be a holy-day. Second Shepherdess. See, morn appears; a rosy hue Steals soft o'er yonder orient blue: Soon let us meet in trim array, And frolic out this holy-day!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First Voice. Swell the trumpet's boldest note! Second Voice. Let the drum it's thunders roll! Both. And, as on aery wings they float, Spread Alfred's name from pole to pole! Chorus. Our sons unborn, Still on this morn With annual joy shall tell; How by his might, In daring fight, The foes of England fell. Air. Prince, of every fame possest! Prince and patriot both confest! Thy grateful Albion shall to latest days Roll down thy glories in a tide of praise! Chorus. Thy grateful Albion shall to latest days Roll down thy glories in a tide of praise!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following SONG was altered by the author, and is now printed as it is sung. I.

The nations, (not so blest as thee,) Must in their turns to tyrants fall; While thou shalt flourish great and free, The dread and envy of them all. CHORUS. Rule, Britannia, &amp;c. III.

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. CLIVE. While our grave Hermit, busy above stairs, Employs his serious head on state affairs, Gallants, look hereâfaith I have plaid the rogue, And stole his wandâby way of epilogue. You critics, there below, had best be civil: For I, with this same rod, can play the devil; Ty all your busy tongues up, one by one, And turn what share of brains you haveâto stone: The beau's soft scull convert to solid rockâ What then?âthe wig will always have it's block. But for the men of sad and solemn face, The deep dark sages in or out of place, Who much in port and politics delight, Small change, God knows, will make them statues quite. The ladies tooâbut now these witlings sneerâ No, fair ones, you shall meet no insult here: I only hint my powerâthat, if I list, I yet can charm you two long hours from whist. But, cards are ready, you are all bespokeâ To spoil a dozen drums, would be no joke. Besides, 'twould be mere arbitrary sway: Such as, of old, was us'd at Nero's play, Who, when he sung and fiddled to the town, Still, as his subjects yawn'd, would knock them down. No, sirs; to gain a heart, we must not teize: Who would engage it, first should aim to please. This part be mine: and, if I now succeed To my own wish, you will be pleas'd indeed. Thenâfor a trial: thus, I wave my hand, To prove the power of this inchanting wand. On waving her wand, The scene opens, and discovers a beautiful valley, bordered on each hand by forest trees, rising irregularly, and forming from space to space various groves. The prospect behind is a landschape of woodlands, and of mountains that ascend above one another, till the last seem to lose themselves in the sky. From the summit of the nearest hill a river pours down, by several falls, in a natural cascade. The warbling of birds is heard. First Entry. A husbandman, his wife, and family. She. How soft is the scene! The woodlands how green! What charms in the nightingale's lay! He. Fair peace, that now reigns On our hills and our plains, 'Tis peace bids all nature be gay. Chorus. 'Tis peace bids all nature be gay. She. The distaff, He. The plow, Both. Shall employ our hands now, For ourselves and our children alone. He. Secure from the foe, We shall reap what we sow: And the year, the whole year is our own! Chorus. And the year, the whole year is our own. She waves her wand. Second Entry. A shepherd, and shepherdess. They run into each others arms. She. If to meet is all this pleasure, Sure, to part was killing pain! Both. Yes, to part was killing pain! He. If 'twas grief to lose our treasure, How transporting to regain! Both. O 'tis transport to regain! He. Thus possessingâ She. every blessing Crowns the maidâ He. And crowns her swain. Both. Crowns the happy maid and swain! She waves her wand. Third Entry. Soldiers descend the mountain by two different paths: at the bottom they lay down the spoils with which they are loaded; and then, advancing, two of them sing the following ballad. First Man. We have fought; we have conquer'd: and England once more Shall flourish in fame, as she flourish'd before. Our fears are all fled, with our enemies slain: The verses marked with an asterisk to be sung a second time by both. Could they rise up anewâ Second. We would slay them again. His monarch to serve, or to do himself right, No Englishman yet ever flinch'd from the fight. For why, neighbours all, we are free as the king: The verses marked with an asterisk to be sung a second time by both. 'Tis this makes us braveâ First. And 'tis this makes us sing. Our prince too, for this, will be thankful to fateâ It is, in our freedom, he finds himself great! No force can be wanting, nor meaner court-arts: The verses marked with an asterisk to be sung a second time by both. He is master of allâ Second. Who will reign in our hearts! Should rebels within, or should foes from without, Bring the crown on his head, or his honor, in doubt; We are readyâ First. Still readyâand boldly foretell, That conquest shall ever with liberty dwell! Second. But now, bring us forth, as the crown of our labor, Much ruine and good chearâ First. With the pipe and the tabor. Let our nymphs all be kind, and our shepherds be gay: For England, Old England, is happy to day. Chorus. Let our nymphs all be kind, and our shepherds be gay: For England, Old England, is happy to day! They all mix in a dance, to the pipe and tabor. The End.</field>
