      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion of the Life of Julian, from “Speed's Historie.” Edit. 1632. “But now one errour, his apostacie, disroabing him of all his morall vertues, leaves him an object naked to the vulgar eie, but a monster of men, and marke of infamie. I holde it therefore fitting no lesse the use, than the justice, of a story, to doe him (as I have done) all his right: since in him we learne thatt all those admirable endowments of nature, embellished with all the morall and internall graces that art could adde, are not the base of holinesse, without divine grace: nor dalliaunce of fortune and fulnesse of empire (that made this man wanton and forgettfull) is the center of security and happinesse, without heavenly protection: since from the sense of sacred piety hee fell to pagan superstition: for many are called, but few are chosen; and in the seat of Presumptuous Majesty hee felt the rod of Divine Revenge.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The House of Constantine gave eleven Sovereigns (including the associate Cæsars) to the Roman Empire, and terminated with Julian the Apostate. Its greatness was sullied by domestic crimes, which gradually produced its extinction. Julian, and his elder brother Gallus, were the offspring of Julius Constantius, the patrician, brother to Constantine the Great; and were withdrawn from successive proscriptions, so fatal to the Imperial race, by the efforts of Mark, bishop of Arethusa—a service but ill requited in after-days. The brothers were eventually adopted by their uncle, the Emperor Constantius, at the instance of his wife, Eusebia—a woman gifted with many noble qualities. It was vainly, and perhaps absurdly, hoped, that the youths would, in the enjoyment of Imperial favour, forget the wrongs of their family, and the death of their father, who had perished by the hands of an assassin. Gallus was created Cæsar, and was united in marriage to a sister of the Emperor. He speedily fell a victim to his own folly and the unruly passions of his wife; not long surviving the suspicions of a sovereign never appeased without blood. Julian succeeded to the vacant dignity, apparently ill-suited to habits formed in the schools, and on which courtiers and philosophers pronounced widely differing opinions. At Athens his education was completed, and his proficiency in all mental accomplishments gave proof of genius and unwearied perseverance. Among the philosophers with whom he there became intimate, Maximus obtained the chief hold of his affections, and established a decided influence over his imagination. Under his tuition, doubts of the truth of that religion in which he had been early trained, were artfully suggested. It was the faith of his household oppressors, and gradually gave place to the seductive delusions of pagan worship, in a mind gifted above all with an irregular enthusiasm. At length he was allowed to participate in the Eleusinian mysteries; when, it is asserted, he consented to his uncle's death: —an act suitable to his vengeance and to his ambition, and the appropriate consummation of his apostacy. At this period my drama commences, for I have not dared to detail in language the progress of impiety, or to array the arguments that seduced a Christian from his God. Julian had been invested by Constantius with the sovereignty in Gaul: a splendid but difficult command, in the course of which an unexpected military genius developed itself. At the moment of his colleague's reverses in the East, he was victorious in the West. Thus the advancement of his reputation became a source of contrast and the foundation of jealousy: add, too, that as the idol of the army he was dangerous. His humiliation was decreed; and the very moment of triumph was rashly selected to separate a general from troops that adored him, and to tear those troops from the scene of their successes, to recruit a distant and a disgraced army. These were mandates dangerous to resist, but fatal perhaps to obey. The army of Gaul regarded them as a violation of its compact of service, and was probably not ill prepared for a crisis. A tumultuous assembly of the soldiers pronounced the reign of Constantius at an end, and hastily invested Julian with the Imperial titles. At a critical moment Constantius died, and his nephew ascended the throne, now his by the undisputed right of succession. Julian with all his faults was unquestionably a great man, and, though an Apostate, possessed many noble qualities. No man had warmer partisans or severer enemies; consequently no one has been more variously represented. His vengeance was not unnatural in times of extreme peril, of unbridled passion, and bloody precedent; and his apostacy, real or affected, placed him at the head of a party panting for change. As to his real creed, it is difficult to imagine a man surrendering his senses to the delusions of the pagan mythology, yet the fact is not impossible. I am disposed to regard him as, at heart, a deist; making use of popular superstitions for the attainment of political objects. In the following drama I have not sought to observe the unities. It would be alike presumptuous in me to plead the example of our great national school, or to argue a point on which the best critics are at variance. It, however, does appear to me sufficient to connect, in a consecutive chain of action, visible effects derived from intelligible causes. That I have failed in accomplishing my own ideas is a fact I cannot hide from myself; but the present is a first effort, and may, I would hope, lead to better things. A. DE V.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Interior of the Cavern of Eleusis.—Night. Julian. Oh, ye mysterious and invisible beings That throng this palpable darkness, and do give These tombs of earth awful vitality! I hear the rushing of your sightless wings Sweep, with an unimaginable speed, Around this mortal substance! Vault of darkness, Thou gloomy mother of all hideous shadows, Thy void is pregnant with a phantom life; Thy vast receptacles are filled with breathings Cold expirations, that stir up my hair And cling to my damp forehead. Haply I stand Within the portal of Eternity, Amid death's heavy atmosphere—environed By th' incorporeal essence of past life, And souls that wait their advent! Awful beings! Impetuous and incessant travellers! Swift couriers of two worlds! Connecting stream 'Twixt corruptible man and the pure Gods! Here I confront you—firm, yet not unmoved. Oh ye inscrutable company, vast tide Of spirits, in your mighty ebb and flow, Here, in the midst of you I stand, and shrink not! (Enter Maximus behind, in his sacerdotal vestments, and stands some time contemplating Julian. Maximus. Julian! Julian (with a start). Who calls? Maximus. Julian! Julian. Or man, or spirit, I answer thee! Behold me here—behold me! Ha! art thou there, Maximus? 'Twas startling To hear thy sudden voice in such a place— A voice too, such as thine, caught by the echoes That have their dwelling 'neath these arched roofs And long evolving chambers. I was musing On things that are not of this world: aye, dallying With dreams that others shrink from;—communing With disembodied Nature, in her den Of lonely desolation, silent and dark. I am not sorry, Man, to see thee here; Thou hast left me to unwelcome company, My own poor thoughts. Maximus. Lord Julian, I have prayed In thy behalf with fervour, that hath power To reach the ear of Heaven—zeal that controlleth The world of spirits. A deep trance came o'er me Beneath the altar of great Cybele. I saw the Berecynthian Mother rise Awful before me: her habiliments As in the Phidian marble: crowned with towers, The Lion-drawn stood in her brazen chariot. What passed I may not tell thee. The bright veil That shrouds those forms ineffable no hand Of mortal mould may raise. JULIAN. Old Maximus, I reverence much thy character, and gaze Upon thy countenance and ethereal eye, As on a page where holiest things are writ, As on a beacon whence the light of Heaven Looks out. I 've heard from thee, doctrine beyond The ken of common minds, and do believe Have hearkened with intelligence. I came To be resolved on matters of high import, And will not now depart unsatisfied. Lead on! MAXIMUS. Oh, worthy of thy destinies! Canst thou with heart undaunted, brain unseared, Peruse the mystic leaves, wherein are graven The lessons of eternity? Canst thou behold The presence and the glory, nor dissolve Like Semele? JULIAN. My heart is firm: There 's nought within the compass of humanity But I would dare and do. MAXIMUS. Nay, pause, reflect— I would not lead aught of mere earthly dross Into our hidden shrine and sanctuary. Once there, thou art no longer man. The cloak Of human thoughts and passions must fall from thee: Thou must decay, to be reanimate With loftier fires. Thou must transmute Thy baser mould to a more noble metal— Ore more divine. Thy soul then must imbibe The light, and take the stamp of fate, and be Her minister, albeit of good or evil; Her delegate, to execute or die! JULIAN. I am resolved. MAXIMUS. Then follow me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interior of the Cavern, hung with stalactites, &amp;c. &amp;c. At the extremity an Altar, on which lies a scroll. Two Priests standing on each side. Enter Julian and Maximus. JULIAN. This silence, and these shadows, and cool air, Impress the heart with reverence. The calm Simplicity and the majestic repose Of these eternal chambers, at the root Of mortal habitation, that regard not Time, but exist as if time had no lapse, Do fill the mind with awe, and hold the senses More anchored in the placid calm of faith, And unresisting fealty to Heaven, Than the more gorgeous fanes of upper air; The monumental temples and proud palaces, Where, on her throne of clay, sits militant Awful Religion! MAXIMUS. Tread softly and with reverence. We are now Before a present Deity. These halls Are unprofaned with human workmanship: All that thou see'st—those fretted roofs high arching From their vast pillars, those broad coigns and friezes, And sculptured pomp grotesque, and marble floors, And roofs of pendulous chrystal:—these are all Nature's primeval architecture. JULIAN. Gods! How glorious are ye in your earthly dwelling! Here let me kneel! MAXIMUS. Julian, dost thou believe The mystery of that world of spirits divine, The everlasting conclave, who sit throned In Heaven, and rule the air and earth and waters; Aye, and the penal caverns of deep Hell? The sublimated essences, whence man Takes his mixed character of good and evil: Imperfect 'midst perfection? JULIAN. Pray you, pardon me: My soul is like a steed in act to spring— Hot expectation swelling every vein, The course before him and the goal in sight. This is no place to lecture points abstruse; I stand at gaze. Who shall withhold me? MAXIMUS. Boy! Thy mettle shall be tried. Who slew thy father? Knock at thy heart and ask what Vengeance says. Is there no name stored in its inmost core— No execrated memory that smoulders, Like a pent flame, within thy seething brain? The book of fate lies open to thee.—Read. Thy glory and Heaven's will, vindictive dæmons Therein have graved in bloody characters! Ha! does the light beam on thee? Thou art busy Now with ten thousand thronging thoughts, dim gliding Before the glass of apt imagination. Do'st start? JULIAN. Thy dark surmises make the blood Rush refluent to my heart. Shuddering I hear. No, not for empires! But, go on— MAXIMUS. 'Twere vain. Those prodigies, those mysteries, those omens, That should have nerved, have daunted thee. Away, Thou art unworthy! JULIAN. Art thou mad? unworthy! Oh, yes! most weak, most impotent, to stand Thus parleying with dishonour! MAXIMUS. Be it so— Then die the slave thou art. Nay, frown not on me. I am an old man, and am sick of life: My country was my all: she is betrayed; And gladly would I die upon her bosom, Kissing the wounds her worthless sons have made. Yet had I hoped, oh! Julian, thou wert the stem, To whose precocious growth and branching vigour, I, and some millions of despairing souls, (Now withering in the tempest of bad times) Have long looked up for shelter. Thou wert the bow Arching in beauty o'er our sullen skies— The little cloud upon the desert's edge, Feeding our faintness with fore-tasted showers. But now—come, come, we'll talk no more on't. Well, Go, stagnate in thy apathy. My lot Is cast for death: I cannot sit beneath The poison-tree and live. JULIAN. Is there no way, No unpolluted pass, to Fame, unpaved With human bones? MAXIMUS. Too scrupulous boy! Thou hast bruised the serpent's tail, And wilt thou spare his head to sting thee? Fie! Thou art a feeble reasoner. The tree, Whence all our sprouting woes rankly have sprung, Must be uprooted. It were vain to prune The branches, when the stem is in its prime, And the root vigorous. JULIAN. I would have mercy, That, like the sweet bird in the depth of oaks, Hath dwelling in heroic hearts. MAXIMUS. No doubt. Yet mercy oft hath but a feeble judgment. I would not kill, but execute. Remember, Crime makes the felon, and pronounces that Which else were murder, expiation. Evil and good cannot be co-existent. But your mind wanders from me. JULIAN. Nay, I listen With a most rapt attention. MAXIMUS. Why should he live? They, who would wish him well, should wish him dead, Not as a King, but an undoubted Tyrant; Not as his brow usurps another's crown, (And that it does, thou art a living witness,) But that his evil passions do pervert Heaven's attributes, and his accursed deeds Soil his else god-like presence with the stain Of earth, and leave him the vile slave of guilt. His death will be th' acquittance of our wrongs; The balance of much evil: to it men look For their withheld inheritance—as robbed heirs Towards unjust guardians. Now, but a thread upholds The axe of justice over him: who cuts it Shall be his country's saviour. Thus did Brutus, Even on the blood that sprung from his own veins, Execute justice: when his country's good Demanded the great sacrifice, he made it. So shouldst thou too be honoured. JULIAN. My chafed spirit Hath dallied with such thoughts: too deeply plunged Into the vague abyss of thy dark counsels. MAXIMUS. Why should he wish to live? He will be happier In the sealed chambers of the silent tomb, Than on a sapped and tottering throne; 'mid guards, Whose fawning knees and sycophantic tongues Stir thoughts of bloody treason. Now, he dies The death by inches—every hour brings with it The anticipated torture. He regards All seasons, and all places, and all men With undisguised and irrepressible horror. There 's suffocation for his bed, swift arrows For his high throne of grandeur, sudden daggers In his close walks, and poison at his board. Where'er he moves destruction follows him, A blood-hound on his track, and keen Dismay With her hawk's wing o'ershadows him. I tell thee He will be better in the grave: the curses That shall accompany his obsequies Will find no echo in the house of death— His clay will be as callous to our strokes As now his evil heart is to our prayers. We shall look round for once, and say, where is he? And then forget for ever! JULIAN. How tuneably My soul, like a touched instrument, responds Beneath thy master-hand! Aye, I have shaken Allegiance from my heart; but, Maximus, He is my blood—'twere parricide! MAXIMUS. Oh, Thou Great Spirit, that do'st haunt these sacred caves, And fillest with vengeance my unshrinking soul, Even as a sacrificial cup with blood, deign visit His fainting resolution; and light up His veins and vaulting mind with thine own lightning. Julian! must all our wrongs die unrevenged? What, in the very presence of the Gods, Wilt thou renounce their delegation? Go! Go, bind the chains thou 'st sworn to sever! Go, Fawn at the despot's footstool! Supplicate Pardon, and say, “Behold thine enemies!” There is no middle course. Thy steps must mount On his neck, or on ours; or, failing both, Die, like thy father, and be so forgotten. Ah! art thou moved? That name hath stirred thee up With memory of intolerable wrong. Think of his bleeding corpse, crushed by that boar That broke into his vineyard and assailed him, Even as he sat in sunny confidence In the sweet garden of his family; With all his flowers around him, and no thought But of domestic love and privacy. Behold his spouting wounds, his dying eyes, His moving, voiceless lips: thy maddening mother With her fixed look: the murderer o'er his prey, And turning from his victim and his vengeance With the cold languor of satiety. Think on it all—and thou, like Hannibal, Lifting thy little hands, vowing revenge! JULIAN (walking aside with agitation). Just Gods! Just Gods! MAXIMUS. Ay call, and they shall answer thee. All laws of God, of Nature, and of Nations Devote such, like the savage beasts of prey, At any time, by every hand to perish! JULIAN. Oh! that the curse that strangles at my heart, Might find a voice and die not! Oh, that the fury, That maddens in my pulses and my brain, Could take a palpable form, a vital nerve, To tread him down and stamp him into dust! MAXIMUS (aside). Hot spirit, art thou roused? Now be thy vengeance Pander to cloaked ambition, and so work The unseen will that rules thee! JULIAN. May all the pangs Of dying guilt, anticipating Hell, Glare on his tossing slumbers, and tear out Rest from his eyes, till madness sears his brain, And preys upon the ashes of his heart! Oh! when he dies, may the infernal fiends Smile hideous from the dim depths of his chamber Upon his eye, when coming Death hath purged it— May no sweet thought of recollected good Slake his last burning thirst; but thronging visions Of terrible conscience scare him! Hear me! hear me! (During the latter part of this speech, the Priests bring forward the Altar and the parchment, upon a signal from Maximus.) MAXIMUS. Thou art thyself again! Now, Julian, now, While the divine wrath triumphs in thy veins, Be thy great curse accomplished. Take this pen; His fate is in this scroll—sign, and he dies! (Julian eagerly signs. Maximus gives the paper to a Priest, who departs with it instantly.) MAXIMUS. Now are the gods of Rome avenged! Constantius, Thy hours are numbered—these few lines have slain thee. Thou art arraigned and judged! Thy power gone by, As a forgotten storm! Thou wert, and art not! (Turning to Julian, who appears agitated.) But how is this, my sov'reign? Why dost thou look So pallid, and thus gaze on vacant air? Thy foot is in the flood—fear not to trust Thy bark upon the mountain wave; 'twill bear thee, With thy magnificent freightage, to fair shores And happy harbours. Fear it not. JULIAN. I fear! It is a word unwritten in my heart! But something—(a delusion of the brain) Something hath shook me. As I signed just now, A form of mild and melancholy beauty Stood by my side and frowned. When I had signed, I looked—the place was void! I do believe That shape my guardian spirit and good genius; And that he hath passed from me! MAXIMUS. Pshaw! such dreams Are all unworthy of thy manhood. Let us Return from these deep vaults to the pure air: The uncertain flicker of our torches gives A body to these vapours, and creates Shadows like substances. We'll think not on them. Now, champion of the gods, attend me. Now Thou art worthy of the deep and awful rites That veil our Eleusinian mysteries. Knowledge and power—the future and the past Are henceforth thine. One hour, and thou shalt quaff Deep from the cup of immortality! (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Camp in Gaul. Mutius and other Soldiers. MUTIUS. Heard you the news? SOLDIER. No, what is 't? MUTIUS. Heard you not? You should know then; and every man, methinks, Who boasts the name of Roman or of soldier, Should have his heart in mutiny. 2D SOLDIER. Ay, Mutius? Why, what 's the matter now, man? There is not A rumour, on its swallow wing, that flits About our summer camp, but you attend Its idle flight. 3D SOLDIER. 'Tis true, your mouth is ever The herald of bad tidings. Scarce a week Has passed since thou didst tell a ghastly tale Of pillage, rape, and murder: some wild tribe, Some locust horde of Belgians, that thou saidst Had swam the Rhine at night, and like a tempest Swept in our rear. Oh! 'twas most circumstantial. Shame! shame! MUTIUS. Kind Sirs, have mercy. I confess Sometimes too zealously I do interpret Rumours that lack precision, and have been To fame a hasty midwife; but just now The jade hath brought a brat forth, whose shrill cry Will fill the world with wailing yet. 1ST SOLDIER. Nay, Mutius; Thou hast a quick ear and a ready tongue, Prithee expound. What is the news? MUTIUS. No matter: I 'm but an idle loiterer at the skirts Of rumour, the mere mouth-piece of false fame. I 'll not disturb your equanimity With my vain breath. 2D SOLDIER. Good Mutius, think not so. In truth we meant no imputation: 'Twas but the jesting of good fellowship. MUTIUS. Methinks you love the Cæsar? 1ST SOLDIER. Ay, Heaven guard him! MUTIUS. I take it too, that he acquits his debt Of love to you with interest. He pays back Your service with good deeds, and deals to all The glory he but shares. SOLDIERS. Ay, bless him! bless him! MUTIUS. Why have you left your homes, your bridal beds, The hearths on which you played in infancy? Your vineyards are unpruned, your leas unploughed, Your pastures run to waste. Your wives sit weeping 'Neath the neglected porch, and watch in vain The wished return, till they are sick with longing. Why have ye not returned? Did you not promise, When you had chased the spoiler from your gates, When you had freed your country (as you have done Beneath his glorious guidance), did you not promise Back to return in triumph and in peace? SOLDIERS. 'Twas our assurance. MUTIUS. Ye are trusty fools. Go to—we are betrayed. Cæsar and people. SOLDIERS (tumultuously.) Betrayed? speak out, speak out! MUTIUS. Ay, that I will. There is an old man on a tottering throne, An Emperor in the east, who thinks our lives here Too much secluded; we must see the world; And, at his will, track half its zone, to make Acquaintance with the bears of Caucasus. SOLDIERS (tumultuously.] 1st. 'Tis false, he dare not do it. 2nd. We would not go. 3rd. By Hercules, I would not move a foot. 4th. Nay, we would march with arms in our good hands. 1st. Our contract 's broke. 2d. 'Tis manifest. 1st. Let 's run To our good Cæsar's tent and ask redress. MUTIUS. 'Twere vain. We have seen him lately, as a man Fretted by some immedicable ill, Worn down by care. He hath estranged himself From all old haunts, customed society. And whence is this? Say, they break faith with us, Then are they false to him. If they forget Our service, they neglect his fame and blight His honour. We are linked by fate: our sacrifice Unites him as a victim. 1ST SOLDIER. Haste to the Cæsar. We'll know the worst at once. 2nd. We 're but the sport Of women and smooth eunuchs. 3rd. 'Twere as well To owe allegiance to the Antipodes! 1st. Would that our own brave Julian were our Emperor! 2nd. Huzza, huzza! 'Tis a brave thought! 3d. Away! Run and salute him at his tent.

      <field name="fulltext">Interior of Julian's tent. Julian on a couch in the back ground. Enter Maximus. MAXIMUS (gazes some time on JULIAN.) O paltry human nature! What, must I mount By such poor things as these? Thou woman-hearted! Thy veins run milk—not blood. Would 'twere slow poison, So might'st thou be short prologue to my drama! Shrink'st thou from crimes that other hands commit? Ere I have done with thee, thy soul shall drink Deep of that draught! Thy lips shall smack of blood! That hand shall smell of slaughter! that weak heart Pant in the hot chains of an evil conscience! Oh! I shall link thee with the dæmons yet, And make thee all infernal! What if he fail? What if I lose this goodly stake? Why then, On earth, in Hell, thou shalt partake perdition. (Aloud. Lord Julian! be a man; awake, arise! (Julian slowly raises himself on his elbow, surveys Maximus, waves him to depart, and sinks down again.) MAXIMUS. How shall we rouse him from this lethargy? The tide of opportunity ebbs quickly. Who waits there? Ho! (Enter a Soldier. Know'st thou the Lord Nevitta? SOLDIER. Ay, my good Lord. MAXIMUS. The Cæsar needs his presence. (Exit Soldier. My plot hath been well weighed, well timed, and hath Conspiring agents in thy breast, Constantius. But, ere thou diest, thy own rash choice must give A colourable motive and just purpose To such bold actions. Thus we reconcile, Ay league, opinion to our enterprize. Enter Nevitta. Nevitta, brave Nevitta! souls like thine Spurn the delays of cautious policy. In truth it irketh me too. But Nevitta, Lives must be spared: we shed no innocent blood; And therefore plot before we strike. NEVITTA. Good Priest, I am a soldier, rough of soul and limb, And, in a good cause, care not where I strike. The skilful leech spares not his probe. MAXIMUS. 'Tis true. And yet, we must be scrupulous, if only For virtue's sake; nor incompatible With valour and the law of soldiership: And therefore have we plotted ere we strike. The messengers from that poor cozened fool Constantius must arrive soon. That will rouse Our splenetic warrior there. But, my Nevitta, Hast thou sent airy Fame forth through our camp To blow strange rumours in affrighted ears? NEVITTA. Even so: a trusty representative; A tall, gaunt soldier, with a querulous eye, That ever spies round discontentedly; Restless of limb, and restless in his tongue: A man too modest for the naked truth. In short, a very poet, who can make Marvels seem facts, and all facts marvellous. MAXIMUS. Right, right. This sows the seeds of discontent Coming events shall ripen. What's his name? NEVITTA. An old centurion, Mutius. MAXIMUS. 'Tis well. Enter an Officer. How goes the camp? Thy steps are hasty. OFFICER. Sir, A sudden mutiny has ta'en men's minds, I know not wherefore. MAXIMUS. Well, we have heard some rumour; What hast thou seen, what heard? OFFICER. Some, with wild cries, Run to their arms; some, like men roused from sleep, Half-naked, spring on their unharnessed horses: Here 's one, on the sudden snatches a trumpet up, And sends a dissonant blast through its hoarse throat, Then bellows ‘Treason.’ There, on a heap of armour, With looks of lean dismay, a night-worn sentinel Limps up and plays the demagogue, thick crowds Hemming him round with their up-gaping faces. MAXIMUS. Hear'st thou, Nevitta? Thou hast loosed a mad dog Amongst our sober legion'ries. NEVITTA. Brave Mutius! It is in truth a cunning hound, and keen too; No nose like his to hunt a cool scent up; He hath the natural aptitude. Enter another Officer. 2D OFFICER. My Lords, The camp is all in motion: hither tending Some unexpected pageant. Legates, they say, From the Emperor. MAXIMUS. So soon, so very soon? The Gods promote our enterprise. Nevitta, To thy post: be circumspect. NEVITTA. I say, be bold. (Exeunt Nevitta and Officers. Enter Anatolius, introducing Jovian, Hormisdas, and Bishop of Arethusa, as from a Journey. MAXIMUS (aside.) True, yet my mind misgives me. (Glancing at Julian's couch. He's not himself now: These moments are as ages! (Aloud, as if on the sudden perceiving them. Ha! dear friends, Lord Prefect Jovian—Prince Hormisdas.—Thou too, Most reverend Mark of Arethusa! Welcome. We had some foretaste of your coming: men Cooped up in idle camps, having quick ears, Catch the faint echo of approaching footsteps. JOVIAN. Thanks, Maximus, and many greetings. Truly, Our coming seemed to stir men's minds: methought Your warriors hemmed us in so surlily, We men of peace half liked it not. MAXIMUS. Regard them As wild beasts—but in bondage: they were beneath The keeper's eye, and knew it. MARK. 'Twas our surety. But say, Sir, is the Prince well? MAXIMUS. Holy prelate, Your presence is a cordial which he needs. Doubtless ye come kind messengers; and trust me, 'Tis best so: he's much changed. But, pardon me, Your presence comes so gratefully upon us, Cheering our faintness like a spring i' th' desert, That I forget my duties, and postpone My customed loyal thoughts to courtesy. How is my much-loved and imperial Master? JOVIAN. Well—yet not well: and, Maximus, it grieves me To see the Cæsar thus: much do I fear My errand— MAXIMUS. Soft, 'tis right he be apprised (And quickly, or he'll chafe else) of your mission. Excuse me, Sirs. (He approaches Julian's couch. My Lord! Here 's news of one You value much, Constantius. JULIAN (starting up violently.) Say'st thou so? Is the deed done? Let 's see thy hands: they have No stain: they want the livery of slaughter. Go, go. Thou tempest me, I am a man yet, A slave—but yet a man, a guiltless man! MAXIMUS. My Lord, you do mistake. JULIAN. Ay, 'tis gone forth, The fiat, and the deed of wickedness Hath had its consummation in the will! Oh that the thoughts were sealed, or had no record! MAXIMUS. Sir, this is not a time for idle qualms; Arouse your mind. Behold what eyes are on you. JULIAN (stepping fiercely forward.) Whom have we here unbidden? I did abjure The presence of my species. I have no kindred Feeling with any of your race: my heart Dwells lonely in its scorn of earth and man: Why am I thus intruded on? Away! MARK. Julian, Not all ignoble pilgrims, to a shrine Of many noble attributes we journey On a forced errand. JULIAN. Ha! what voice is that? It hath the spell of oracles; it wakes The murmurs of departed memory Within my anxious brain! Thou good old man, What dost thou here? Alas, this is no home For piety and virtue. Why art thou here? Eyes should not meet, when hearts are far asunder. MAXIMUS (aside.) This must not be: there 's danger in these thoughts.— My Lords, our conference must close. Some rumours Have got into this busy heart, our camp, Doubtless of weak invention, yet sufficing To peril the realm's peace. Ambassadors, You may perhaps appease this troubled spirit. Enter Nevitta, Mutius, and crowd of angry Soldiers. NEVITTA. I can restrain this mob no longer. There 's not a tuneless throat in our wild army But clamours for their General. Here they press Like jackals that do bay the moon. JULIAN. Kind friends, I can appreciate your zeal, and am not Blind to affection; yet it pains me. Pray you Rein in your passions with discretion. Men Who know us not, to such a scene as this Might give a strange interpretation. Pray you retire. 1ST SOLDIER. General, you are betrayed. 2nd. They have deceived us, Cæsar. 3rd. What are these men? 1st. What purpose ye? 2nd. (in an attitude of menace) Speak, speak, or— JULIAN. Hold, my friends: On your allegiance—on your love! Good Jovian, You hold the clue here. Solve it, I beseech you, JOVIAN. Romans, you were not wont to soil your steel With old men's blood, or trample the white hairs Of a defenceless veteran in the dust. If haply I'm a messenger of evil, (And keep in mind, I'm but a messenger) Yet, must I shrink back from a solemn duty, Because the task be perilous? Oh, no! I fear not, for I know you. MUTIUS (from the crowd.) Worthy Sir, To the point. JOVIAN. Prince Julian, 'tis the imperial will That you forthwith repair to Thrace; meanwhile Those legions too march eastward. (Soldiers rush forward, Julian throws himself before Jovian.) JULIAN. Touch him not: Touch him not, Soldiers—he is innocent. This tent is sacred as the hallowed altar; Our presence is a sanctuary. MUTIUS (from the crowd, who fall back.) General, We must obey you. Yet, by Mars! no matter— Doubtless you know best: so, fall back, brave comrades, Stir not a finger. 1ST SOLDIER. Hark-ye, old man, I would We had you to ourselves. 2nd. Ay, by the Gods! We have met, but have not parted. JULIAN. Faithful companions— MUTIUS. Silence, ye snarling knaves. Have ye no sense? Our General would be heard. JULIAN. Old comrades! hear me. I have fought too many fields with you, and braved Death in too many shapes with you, and tried Your valour by its true test—mercy; proved Your faith by patience in adversity; Your just affection by your firm obedience; And cannot now mistrust you. See you here These two old men—(and worthier never yet Grew grey in their ungrateful country's service)— Is it their fault their master does a wrong? Is it their folly that he is not wise? Must they await the penance of his crime? No more, no more of this. Already in Your altered eyes I read your better judgment. Now let me touch more pressing topics. Here, In Gaul, our rescued country, a poor remnant, After much toil, much glory, many dangers, We rest at last: it was the promised goal To which we rushed through death. Shall we resign Our hopes, renounce our rights, forget our wrongs, Because an impotent lip beneath a crown Cries “Be it so.” Oh, shall our shattered barks Be at the mercy of a man's weak breath? We, that had looked to dedicate our wounds, And hang our bruised armour up, proud trophies, 'Neath the dear roofs of our domestic Gods— What! are we doomed to rot piecemeal away On far Euphrates marshes? Must we whiten The deserts of Arabia with our bones? Comrades, 'tis thus the Emperor wills. For me, Were disobedience death, I disobey. NEVITTA. (Stepping forward in front of soldiery. Excuse my abrupt speech; in the name of all (For I know all; each individual heart, Lip, eye, and casual change of countenance, Have in this bosom true interpreters;) I answer. You are our old General, And we will have no other General. You are our Sovereign, throned in our strong hearts, And we will have no other Sovereign. As freemen, we reject unlawful bonds; As just men, we will not forego our rights; As brave men, we will fence them with our swords. This is our creed, Sir: this all hearts will ratify: For this we are prepared to die! SOLDIERS. All, all! MAXIMUS. My friends, if after words like these, 'twere prudent To venture somewhat couched in calmer spirit, I might perhaps infer, too much is purposed, Or yet too little done. You have passed the line Of strict allegiance; and the penalty Tyrants have seldom practised to remit. Think of Coriolanus, and with him Contrast the Cæsar of the Rubicon. NEVITTA. Thanks for the hint, old Maximus; we have tried The water's depth, and we will swim the stream. Cæsar! our country has been stabbed through us; Be thou the healer of our wounds. MUTIUS. Speak out: We have cast the die, and must not lose the stake. Speak, Julian, speak—Wilt thou be Emperor? 1ST SOLDIER. Ay, that 's my mind. 2nd. And mine. 3rd. And mine. 4th. And mine. MUTIUS. Then give a general shout, and send scared Echo Even to the frighted ears of Tyranny. No longer Cæsar now, all hail Augustus! Julian Augustus, Julian Augustus, hail! (Julian covers his face with his hand as the Soldiers repeat this cry. They press clamorously round him.) MAXIMUS. My prince, consent; 'tis death or empire. JULIAN. Well, This is no time for thought; no choice; so be it. Comrades, I thank you!—as you will. (General shout. SOLDIERS. Huzza! Huzza, huzza! Long live the Emperor! (The Soldiers lift Julian on their shields and bear him out triumphantly.) Manent Mark, Jovian, Hormisdas. JOVIAN. Bishop of Arethusa, do we dream? Or has some sudden shadow of the brain Obscured our just perceptions? Oh! is this The Julian thou didst wrap thy fancy round, And solaced our slow way with picturing? Saidst thou his soul was eagle-winged? In sooth It hath the talon and the beak—the wing Daring in flight, and eye of empery. MARK. My Lord, in very truth I'm sick to the soul; Bewildered—stunned; struck to the feeble spring Of my old blood. Excuse my fainting spirit; My vigour hath collapsed—I am a child now. JOVIAN. Yet was there never need of manlier counsel; A judgment, calm, clear, deep, like a hushed lake Before the storm hath stirred its anger up. What think'st thou, Prince Hormisdas? Nay, my Lord, Hath thine eye caught the fascination? HORMISDAS. Gods! There is some hope for Persia yet! Behold him, How graciously, yet with what noble air, That master-spirit rides on their stout shoulders. How on their necks, that feel nor weight nor yoke, (Even like caparisoned steeds that snuff the battle,) He plants his firm foot! See, his outstretched arm Draws out his mantle's lordly drapery! He speaks—the sun hath touched his fine-turned head (Bare, and his black locks shook out in the wind) With a new glory. Beautiful! MARK. Alas! Sir, You see, as once I saw, with youthful eyes. HORMISDAS. Oh, if it be the sin of youth to yield The fresh heart to its ecstasy, and clothe Man's mortal mould in garniture of Gods, The visionary garb of hopeless virtue, May I ne'er pass this noon of life, nor mourn The twilight of an earth-worn spirit! JOVIAN. Prince, Thou look'st to the fair side of things; perhaps With more of wisdom, deeper philosophy, Than they who bind down reason to vain schools, And chain kind feelings to the formula Of habit. MARK. Nay, Sir, worldly experience hath Yielded to man maxims, that have the force Of solemn revelation. JOVIAN. I know not. Reason lends small aid in a case like this. MARK. Conscience and faith do much. JOVIAN. My mind misgives me, Julian hath cause to be dissatisfied: Much scope for sorrow; ample precedent For hatred—fear. The name of traitor Suits not with his past actions—traitorous thoughts Were not the aliment of his young hopes. We cannot stem this current: it were better To be partakers of its vigour. MARK. Surely To argue with a heart conflicting thus Were a vain effort: time be our judge. Come, Sir, Let us depart. HORMISDAS. Ay, in the Cæsar's train: My mind 's resolved. Now his, and his for ever.

      <field name="fulltext">Chamber in the Palace. Constantia and her Women at domestic employments. CONSTANTIA (laying down her embroidery.) 'Tis a vain strife: my hand obeys me not. I cannot bind my mind to useful thoughts, Or mould my limbs to steadfast occupation. Oh, little heart lie still! Virgilia! VIRGILIA. Madam? CONSTANTIA. 'Tis strange, is 't not? no tidings yet Have reached me from my husband. Know you aught— Aught that can comfort me? VIRGILIA. Madam, 'tis said The Cæsar hath fresh victories in Gaul. CONSTANTIA. I hate to hear of battles. This rude glory Looks upon woman with a mournful eye; Telling of blood-dissevered ties; sad stories Of widows weeping by lone sepulchres, And orphans flinging flowers on obscure graves. Oh Julian! where art thou? VIRGILIA. Dear Madam, surely, Surely the Prince is well; to-night, believe me, Glad tidings of home-bending steps shall greet you. CONSTANTIA. My good Virgilia; gentle comforter! Thou art most soothing ever. I do believe In spite of this strange flutter at my heart, These bodings, that, like frightful dreams oppress me, These fretful visions, dull anxieties, That make me start at every noise and tremble, I do believe—alas! my heart again Hath got the evil spirit in it, throbbing As if the very blood would burst its channel, Then sinking, faint, and sickly. VIRGILIA. Would to Heaven We were once more at Athens. I remember When you were yet unwedded— CONSTANTIA. Say not any thing Slighting the bliss of wedlock: I would cherish That as my greatest good. VIRGILIA. We were both girls; You, like a vine, swelling your half-ripe clusters Beneath the mellowing sun; we, like the leaves Thick-clustering round to shelter you: nor wholly Without appropriate beauty; yet most noted As setting you off freshly. What a pleasure— When morning opened out his urn of light On top of grey Hymettus, or when evening Pillowed her cheek upon the glossy wave, With purple shadows curtained—how delicious Was 't then to mount that old Acropolis, And pace along the marble ramparts, viewing Whate'er of nature or sublimest art Stands beautiful around: things, though of earth, That have an intellectual language! CONSTANTIA. Sweetly We passed our days there. It was there I saw first My Julian: he was standing in the Stoa, Wrapped in his academic robe, amidst A group of awful men, earth-honoured sages, Discoursing deep philosophy. Go on. VIRGILIA. I call to memory too, the pleasant hours, When, in the noon-tide, like gay butterflies, We revelled in the sunshine—or, like bees, Went culling the sweet flowers. CONSTANTIA. Or sat beneath The temple-crowned height of Sunium. Oh, I loved to stand on some high beetling rock, Or dusky brow of savage promontory, Watching the waves, with all their white crests dancing Come, like thick-plumed squadrons, to the shore Gallantly bounding. VIRGILIA. We had a sweet companion, (Alas! now dead,) Tithona. She was fraught As a full fountain with its sparkling waters, From youth with exquisite thoughts—those graceful fables (For fables they are surely) of old times, When, as they said, the air, and earth, and sea, Were peopled with divinities. You've not Forgotten yet, how prettily she told Her little stories, still embellishing (As she proceeded with her fond enthusiasm And memory of youthful tutelage,) With eloquent mystery and most pagan fancy? You have not these forgotten? CONSTANTIA. Could I forget? I hear with tears: proceed—I love to listen. VIRGILIA. What strange adventures she would tell: of Nymphs Beloved of Satyrs; and transformed maids Wooed by the Tritons in the deep sea-cave, Or sporting in their innocent coquetry On dolphins' backs, round shell-borne Amphitrite Along the heaving billows. There was not A sun-beam, or a cloud, or casual shadow, But had a tale, wild, sweet, imaginative, To account for it; some illustration apt, Some link that bound inanimate nature with Her breathing soul. CONSTANTIA. It was her custom—thus; When clouds were swift careering through the sky, And lights and shades shot o'er the mountain's side, Then would she say the spirits of the air Held their deft revels 'twixt the earth and sun, Casting light shadows downward. Was 't not so? VIRGILIA. Ay, and the Nereids, when 'tis stormy. CONSTANTIA. True; She loved to tell, how, when the wind blows strong Ashore, the Nereids then do love to gather Their flocks from the green deep of troubled ocean; Then might you see the fleecy fools all hurrying, Crowding, and tumbling one a-top the other, Into some sheltered cove, or sunny basin; Rank after rank still rushing up the shore, Leaving their white coats tufting every rock, Then vanishing. VIRGILIA. I do remember too, She told me of a mermaid once, that lay Along the scooped side of a hollow wave, Singing such dulcet music, that the ear, Like a wooed damsel, trembled with delight. CONSTANTIA. I thank thee, sweet Virgilia, for these thoughts: Thou hast weaned me from unprofitable sorrow, At least for the moment—and Heaven knows, this life Should not be preyed upon by phantoms. Welcome, (To Eusebia, entering. My sister, mother, friend! welcome, oh welcome! I stand in need of comfort. It is good To see some face we love, to press some hand That hath the warmth of kindred feeling in it When we feel desolate. But why is this? Thy hand withdrawn, thy face averted from me? Art thou a messenger of grief—Eusebia? Eusebia, speak to me—my Julian?—speak! EUSEBIA. Appease your vain alarm. He lives, is well: But— CONSTANTIA. Oh, delay me not: this long pause kills me. Speak, speak! EUSEBIA. Constantia, I have loved him with A love that few but wives or mothers feel: I loved him, for the life I saved: I loved him For the proud structure of his fame and fortunes, Raised by my skill: I loved him, as he grew Blessed in your loving him ('twas my work too), And now—How can I hate? CONSTANTIA. Hate! good Heaven! Whither does all this tend? EUSEBIA. I dare not tell thee. CONSTANTIA. Knowest thou Virgilia? Ah! thy face looks sad: All faces are turned from me. Oh, I knew Some terrible misfortune overhung me— I had prophetic warnings. Enter an Officer, who whispers Eusebia. EUSEBIA. What 's to be done? so near! terrible conflict! Nay, nay, no compromise with duty. No: At any price the rebel must be stopped. CONSTANTIA. Rebel!—my brain will burn. All, all, I see it. Rebel!—then fratricide! It cannot be. Oh, thrones are built on graves. He dies who falls! Who—what art thou? say quickly. Enter MAXIMUS. MAXIMUS. Hail, Augusta CONSTANTIA. Behold the Empress there: be her's the greeting. MAXIMUS. Julian,—the Emperor—bade me thus salute His wife—Constantia. Therefore hail, Augusta! The circle of the diadem is narrow And will not fit two heads. I kiss thy hand. (Kneeling. CONSTANTIA. Off, off, there 's spotted pestilence upon thee. I dare not touch thee. Rebel! MAXIMUS. Madam, that title The event alone determines. Honour may Look doubtfully on points at issue—but I humbly think that when the die is cast, And the game won, the goodly stake and glory May be conceded to the conqueror. CONSTANTIA. Traitor! MAXIMUS. Recall the name, lady—if mine, At least I bear it in good company. (Rising. 'Tis not for me, the Pontifex of Gods, To kneel at human feet. The Emperor bade me Deliver these few lines, penned in some haste: He will be presently here. Madam, be comforted, (Turning to Eusebia. The heart of memory is soft, yet bears Indelible impressions. You have done Deeds that have stood in good report—kind services To Julian, when he needed them, that live, Stored in his treasury of grateful thoughts. For your sake hath Augustus bade me say, The slayer shall be spared. EUSEBIA. Away, away! I know thee, Maximus: beneath that mantle Thou hidest much hypocrisy. Ambition Within those philosophic folds lies watching, Even like the ambushed wolf, in act to spring. Go, Maximus, and dole in other ears Thy honeyed poison. MAXIMUS. Empress, (as thou wert, And shalt be yet, spite of false fate,) directress Of man's more feeble judgment! Well I know The love thou bear'st to Julian, and the sway Thy counsel should have o'er him. Hear me then— I 've owed thee something. EUSEBIA. Else those preaching lips Had now been mouldering in the elements; And the wind singing through thee. MAXIMUS. Even so. I kept my faith and live—I thank thee for it— My turn comes now: I rule, and I would save thee For better days. Bend to the blast and live— Resist, and be uprooted! EUSEBIA. Tempter, tempter! Enter Sallust as from a journey. Worthy old man, good Sallust, thou arrivest Most opportunely. Saucy traitors tread Thy master's hearth with insolent defiance: Rebellion starts us in our very palace, Nay grasps with impious hand our awful person. In good time dost thou come. Nay, Sir, how 's this? Thine eyes are wet: thy furrowed cheek is pale With more than time: even as a ravelled page Where sorrow writes dim characters. CONSTANTIA. Oh, Sallust! What new misfortune waits us? What of my brother? SALLUST. Mother of Rome, thou art a widow! Princess, Thou hast no brother! (Constantia and Eusebia throw themselves into each other's arms.) MAXIMUS (to the attendants.) Bear in those royal mourners to their chamber. Weak, shallow women! fathomless and witless. You see the way, yet fear to tread it; long With full as deep desires as men, yet shrink From the accomplishment. You would be great, Yet lack the daring; and when nobler hands Have toiled for you, your appetite grows squeamish, And, with most exquisite acting, ye reject That which you crave. (Turning to Sallust. Why, Sallust, 'tis auspicious news. SALLUST. Not so. Though it relieves thee from the garb of treason. MAXIMUS. Add, too, it gives some breathing time for prayer To certain grey-beards, and saves heads on shoulders That else had made acquaintance with the scaffold. How died he? SALLUST. At Tarsus—suddenly. MAXIMUS. No matter: That he is dead suffices—but behold, Here comes the reaper of the harvest. Enter Julian attended. Both kneeling. Cæsar, Julian Augustus, hail! JULIAN (with agitation.) Where is Constantia? MAXIMUS. I gave your letter to the Empress; bending In homage as became me. She thereat Seemed moved, and honoured me with epithets, Excuse me that I blazon not abroad. Then came this messenger of your good fortune, Sallust, from Tarsus; where your enemy, The shedder of your household blood, lies dead. 'Tis not for me to judge or censure—but If Julian pushes yon closed door aside, He 'll gather his Constantia's thoughts, and hear How wives discuss the actions of their husbands, In no equivocal language. (Julian rushes into the inner chamber. (Exeunt. The Imperial Chamber, immediately before day-break. JULIAN. I cannot sleep! Ten thousand, thousand thoughts Crowd in my restless bosom. Phantasy At this lone hour invokes her spectral train, Shadowy suggestions—incontrollable. A fearful hope is busy here, and Memory Sits like a pallid mourner at my side: My heart is swollen with expectation, I know not wherefore—a dull weight is there— Sighing I heave it off, but it returns. My eyes are dim with watching: a broad seal Pressed on my brow by some invisible hand, Scorches my brain. Oh, sleep! Oh, gentle sleep! Would I might court thee on a peasant's pallet: I have not slumbered since I wore a crown! CONSTANTIA (entering.) Julian, my husband! The morning light has dawned. Where hast thou been? These vigils will destroy thee. JULIAN. Ay, my love, The brain hath need of rest: the limbs are strong In spite of many hardships; but the mind— The mind should have repose. Constantia, wherefore Is sleep an alien to these royal chambers? I cannot find beneath this purple robe On all the down of the imperial pillow Even with thy form of beauty stretched beside me, One natural slumber: my eyes are ever open Upon the past and future. I am denied Oblivion! It was not so, Constantia. It was not so! CONSTANTIA. My Lord, forbear these thoughts. We have been happy, and again shall be so: You will redeem all yet. JULIAN. It cannot be. My subjects in revolt, my crown at stake, My glory questioned; the bright world of fame For which my very soul was bartered, all Trembling like foam upon the stormy waters! I have defied my God, and will not now Strike my proud banner to audacious man! CONSTANTIA. Julian, the empire of the earth is thine, What would you more? JULIAN. The Roman Capitol Contains the shrines of many demigods, Mortals, by human worship deified. They trod this world in glory—therefore man Hath clothed them with immortal attributes. CONSTANTIA. My husband, come to rest; these watchful nights Disturb you. JULIAN. Nay, you do believe me mad— Call me ambitious, say, that I despise The folly that has made me so, and scorn The ministering wickedness that crouches round me— Your eye distresses me. CONSTANTIA. Oh, Julian, why Should wisdom and infirmity be brothers? Virtue and vice both wedded to one heart Do breed a hell on earth. JULIAN. I know it—feel it. I have not trod in vain the crooked ways: I have not trampled down opposing nature Unwitting of the peril and the penance. I have attained that height to which the eye Looks with a stupid wonder. I have felt The longings, and enjoyed the full fruition; And what the price? He that has scaled steep mountains, And walked the misty precipice's edge On loose and slippery rocks, hath felt the danger Press, like a giant hand, his shivering heart, Till drops of ice would start. CONSTANTIA. But you have reach'd— JULIAN. Reach'd what?—a lonely pinnacle, from whence The earth looks boundless, but without a feature. There do I stand, a mark for every storm To hiss around—or, haply, seen as one Whose darkened outline moves along a height Spotting the evening's glow. CONSTANTIA. Oh, do not say The lot of greatness cannot be a happy one. Good deeds make happy hearts. The monarch's crown Encircles a vast sphere:—'tis his to raise Unheeded worth from base obscurity; To soothe the sorrow-laden; to crush oppression; Reform the profligate manners of bad times— Oh, 'tis a glorious office. JULIAN. Know yet not, How monarchs are oppressed by stately burdens? They have not leisure for mere private good. The lowly station can alone recall The flying hour by its appropriate virtue, And make for memory paths of pleasantness. But see, through yonder casement, the young sunbeam Looks in with salutation—beautiful type Of those great aspirations that subdue, Mould, and exalt, this mortal case of man To that which makes him more than man; which filling His perishable veins with fire from Heaven Clothe him i' th' immortality of fame! CONSTANTIA. How cool and moist comes in this morning air: Nature awakens with a sigh, and tears Are on her beautiful countenance: a veil Of tender mist partially hangs around her, As if to hide some sorrow ere she smiles. Surely there is infection in these objects; Gazing, a tender pleasure steals upon me, Yet could I weep. JULIAN. All natural objects have An echo in the heart. This flesh does thrill And has connexion by some unseen chain With its original source and kindred substance. The mighty forest, the proud tides of ocean, Sky-cleaving hills, and, in the vast of air, The starry constellations; and the sun, Parent of life exhaustless—these maintain With the mysterious mind and breathing mould A co-existence and community. CONSTANTIA. Julian, in our first love you talked to me Thus, and I never feel the morning air, Or look upon the rising of the sun, Without some sweet associate emotion. Our early love was happy. Was it not? JULIAN. Happy? Oh, yes, most innocently happy! (Sweet woman, thou hast always been so.) Happy? Would I had only studied thy sweet looks, Had sought Divinity but on thy lips, Had asked no other empire but thy beauty— But I have been beset by ravenous appetites; Passions have preyed upon my heart and thriven; The ladder of my wild ambition Hath yielded steps for evil thoughts to mount. Happy?—even you have almost lost the charm, (And how I love thee, witness all ye powers Divine or fabled,) thou that wert once my all— I am a ruin. (He walks apart abstractedly. CONSTANTIA (aside.) My unhappy Julian! Ah, what a wreck is that majestic mind! Thy very features are not what they were, Then were thy beauties shadows, and the light That cast them from thee,—is it all departed? (Julian throws himself upon a couch. He sinks upon that couch—oh, weary, weary! Last night he slept not: haply he may sleep Now and be soothed. Perhaps the breath of music May prove more eloquent than my poor words: It is the medicine of the breaking heart. (Music plays, she approaches him. His eyes are closed. Thou art indeed a ruin, But grand and glorious in thy desolation, Like a decaying temple. I would be The weed that gathers round thy broken pillars, The bird that nestles in thy lonely chambers, The pilgrim kneeling at thy shattered altar, The faithful light that shines with equal warmth On the deserted arch and festal palace. How pale he is, and yet how beautiful! I 'll kiss him as he dreams. (Music again and song. What is Power? 'Tis not the state Of proud tyrants, whom men's hate, To worse than death, Can level with a breath— Whose term the meanest hand can antedate— The peasant with a heart at ease, Is a greater man than these. What is Grandeur? Not the sheen Of silken robes; no, nor the mien And haughty eye Of old nobility— The foolish thing that is not, but has been. The noblest trophies of mankind Are the conquests of the mind. What is Beauty? Not the shew Of shapely limbs and features. No. These are but flowers That have their dated hours To breathe their momentary sweets, then go. 'Tis the stainless soul within That outshines the fairest skin. What is Love? 'Tis not the kiss Of a harlot lip—the bliss That doth perish, Even while we cherish The fleeting charm: and what so fleet as this? He is blessed in love alone, Who loves for years, and loves but one. What is Glory? Not the breath Of vain, venal crowds—nor death Amid the cry Of vaunting victory: Nor on the living brow war's sanguine wreath. He who maintains his country's laws Alone is great; or he who dies in the good cause. Enter Eusebia. CONSTANTIA. Oh, art thou come? my best Eusebia. This is a cordial to my heart. See there, My hope, my fear, my love, my all! Behold him How desolate—desolate. He has not slept. There is no comfort for him. In his bosom Lurks a coiled adder; and that golden crown Presses his temple like a ring of fire. EUSEBIA. Let me approach—softly, I will not wake him. Pale countenance, I would peruse thee. No, Thou 'rt guiltless of that deed—if that in truth He died by any mortal hand. No, No! Thou hast been full of guilt, but not of that; And strangely wert thou tempted— Enter Maximus. There, alas! The tempter comes—ill omens follow him. What does this bad man here? CONSTANTIA. He has strange influence Over his mind, and ever like a fiend Exerts it for his torture. He is to me Courteous, but never meets my eye; and yet I oft feel his on me scowling, and tremble. MAXIMUS. (approaching. Ladies, an humble subject proffers duty. You taste the breath of the morn's infancy: 'Tis healthful in its sweetness. Have I licence To see the Emperor? CONSTANTIA. He has but just wooed sleep: Disturb him not—it were unkind. MAXIMUS. Nay, Madam, My errand, like the heel of Mercury, Hath a swift wing on 't, and may not delay. CONSTANTIA. Do thou then, dear Eusebia, since it must be, Breathe on him softly and so waken him. (Eusebia stoops and kisses his forehead. JULIAN (awakening.) Oh, world! Must I again look on thee? Who art thou? My mother? for by that name I must call you, The willing slave of custom, duty, and love— Thou art most welcome. After tedious vigils, The sight of such a morning face as thine is, (Pale, though it be with sorrow, yet most fresh In the kind streaks of womanly affections) Braces the spring of the mind: for 'tis with me, As with a sick man, viewing once again Fields, waters, woods, and the blue bending skies— Or, as the sudden shadow of a cloud, With its light breeze just starting on the wing, Upon a sultry day. EUSEBIA. Julian, 'tis true, My womanly affections have subdued me (Mysterious in their mastery) to follow The triumph of thy chariot-wheel—but, nay, I come for mutual comfort, and renounce These sad reflections. Pray you, look cheerfuller, Methought you did just now. Are you not satisfied? I cease vain murmuring. JULIAN. 'Twere best, 'twere best! But whom hast thou brought here? Like a conspirator He stands i' th' shade, wrapped in his silent cloak: It is not safe to be o'erlooked. Oh, pardon— Pardon, Lord Pontifex, I do confess At such an hour thou wert (with shame I own it) An unknown apparition, and unlooked for. MAXIMUS. And yet, Sir, I would flatter me, there is That intimate intelligence of minds, That interchange of thought, identity Of habits and of memory, and hopes That we should know each other? JULIAN. Ay, true, true! But why thus early must we slight our pillows? Sleep 's but a feeble foretaste of calm death, Yet half partakes oblivion. Why should we wake To stretch the mind out on untimely racks? MAXIMUS. It grieves me, Sir, to be the messenger Of sorrow. JULIAN. Thereat ease your mind:—I care not. The current of my blood 's tempestuous, And, like the air, I'm liveliest after storms. Does disaffection take a tangible shape? A head this sword can reach? If so, 'tis well. MAXIMUS. No, Sir, your enemies are circumspect, And rather shew like th' unsubstantial shadows That mock the traveller in the desert. Truly These Nazarenes are hydra-headed. Nay Their very blood hath seed in 't, and springs up A crop of holy disputants;—hot zealots Armed at all points. The old tale was no fable. JULIAN. Is this all? MAXIMUS. No; they 've vowed for their new altar A victim; not redress, but stern revenge. They seek not vantage of encountered arms On a fair field, with allies at their back, But, added to that chance, the slow, sure step Of the assassin. JULIAN. Ha! 'tis indeed a sure step— A short solution of much strife. Oh, Maximus, Raise not those thoughts of horror. They awake All deadly passions in me. MAXIMUS. So, let it be. They are not common rebels,—they assail By fraud and force our awful laws, dear habits, Ancient religion, chosen sovereign. They have won the Persian Sapor too. Read there: This paper, black with well-known signatures, Telleth some terrible truths—peruse and judge. Meanwhile I venture to retire. I need not Point out what is inevitable. (Exit. JULIAN (after perusing with violent agitation.) There is no penalty that earthly mould Can bear, or man devise, or wrath inflict, Commensurate with their crime. Down, damned thought! It is not retribution! No, no, no. I never did a deed like this.—Away, Vain spectres of the brain!—I slew no friend; I trampled down no benefactor. Hence! I will not now look back. CONSTANTIA (timidly approaching.) My lord! my husband! JULIAN (not heeding her.) Thou too, old Mark? Oh, treachery, treachery!—my earliest friend! Nay then—one wide proscription strike ye all. CONSTANTIA. Turn not away—turn not away, my love: I would approach thee in the humbleness And sorrowful abasement of bruised love, Gently to probe thy griefs and so to cure them. JULIAN. Thou, thou, my wife, his sister? Get thee gone, Fair woman:—touch not madness in his mood. Go, go. EUSEBIA. Retire Constantia; press him not— Be blind to this, or seem so. (Aside.) (Exeunt. JULIAN (alone.) Why have I made This heart the lair of passion? wherefore trained My soul to lion-like ambition? Thus To be the chase of jackals! Read, proud spirit— Read, who and what thy pitiful hunters are. Nature why hast thou made me thus? Thou shouldst Have cased my heart in iron; trained my lip, Even at my mother's breast, to blood; and leagued My spirit with the vulture. Be it so. Just kings make happy subjects—so, alas! Bad subjects cause the tyranny they curse. Why am I thus enforced? Weak, wretched victims! My life ye aim at, reekless of your own: Ye play deep stakes, nor calculate the loss. Vain plotting knaves! Chartered conspirators, That sit in mockery of justice; thus Dispensing doom—when you yourselves are judged. Ripe though ye be to shedding, justice must be A hardy reaper to embrace you all. Great Gods! what names are here? Mercy, farewell! In vain ye shall not paint me thus—a monster: Ye make the tyrant that ye feign—now tremble! (Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Street in Constantinople. A crowd pass with uproar. 1ST CITIZEN. Here, neighbour here—we'll take our station here. 2nd. Ay, there is vantage for the eye here. How now? Press not upon us so unmannerly. 3rd. We have as good right to press here as you have. Make way, make way. 1st. Good neighbours, do not quarrel, Good mob, be peaceable. Hark, there 's a shout, Be quiet now—you'll hear and see the better. (Mutius passes, affecting a pompous manner. A SOLDIER. Hollo there, Mutius! why man, thou wert used To have a quick ear at a comrade's service— Mutius, I say. MUTIUS. What manner of man art thou? Whom dost thou take me for? I know thee not. SOLDIER. How now, how now! thou dusty specimen Of an extenuated mummy. What! Thou shadow, thou— MUTIUS. Enough— (Drawing, the crowd interposes. CITIZEN. Put up your swords, Untimely brawlers. MUTIUS. Nay, his plebeian breath Hath tainted my gentility. CITIZEN. Fie, fie! We shall have need soon of our swords and courage. MUTIUS. Prithee expound; I have indeed heard rumours. Good man of peace—thrice honoured citizen, Be circumstantial and explicit. CITIZEN. Well, Sir, We shall have war, methinks. Ambassadors From Sapor, King of Persia, have arrived, With much remonstrance, many questionings, To stir our choleric Emperor. MUTIUS. There 's hope then— I'm glad on 't—glad on 't. Comrade, here 's my hand. We 'll fight together bravely yet. Why, gentlemen, I would not boast much what I've known or done; But I have done some service which he knows of— The Emperor—ay, and hath rewarded too. And I can tell you he won't stand much chafing. CITIZEN. Well, we shall see. Th' Ambassadors just now Have wound their brave procession by the Hippodrome, And doubtless will demand free audience. MUTIUS. Humph! they'll have sorry satisfaction. SOLDIER. Centurion! MUTIUS. Sir, accommodate your speech To the advancement of my dignity, I now command a cohort. SOLDIER. Pardon, brave Captain. 'S blood: why not say so sooner? MUTIUS. Circumscribe Thy terror, thou art awe-struck: I am placable. Be satisfied—we shall have sport enough yet. I 'm an old soldier and have swam the Tigris, And I can tell you, there is that beyond Would make the blood dance in an old man's vein. Boy! there is store of golden booty—viands That my teeth water but to think on: then What delicate girls—oh, they're delicious creatures! Look-ye, I've been a learned man in my day, And read the glorious tale of Helena; But never Paris plucked so fair a fruit, Nor when on Ida's top he gave the apple To the divine shape then unveiled in beauty, Marked he such loveliness. CITIZEN. Your melting phrase Hath much infection in it. MUTIUS. Oh, I can tell you, For I have had experience: there are your Georgians, Great Juno! what a race of glorious creatures, I should say angels. Oh, their shapely limbs And airy presence; and the melody Of their rich, melancholy voices, like The breath of the wind upon a harp; and then How rosily their blushing cheeks bloom over Their lily bosoms, and they breathe of flowers. Their eyes have got the tint of the atmosphere, And Heaven looks through them. Hymenæus, oh! There are your loosely-vested Persians too, With their dark tresses, and their eyes, oh, Venus! How beautiful their eyes are: black as a fawn's And sparkling as a sun-beam on a spring, Or stars at midnight. Then their wild expression— The wicked things! CITIZEN. Your eloquence is tempting. On the strength of 't I could fancy me a man Of war—you lead fine lives campaigning. MUTIUS. So—so; But passable upon my reputation. Why, Sir, This life of ours is like an April day, Sunshine and tempest interchangeably. 'Tis good when comrades gather round the board And dip their jests in rosy wine: 'tis good When at the close of a well-foughten field, The unharmed victor counts the goodly spoil: 'Tis good when the strained limbs expatiate On a down cushion, or a couch of heather: 'Tis good to dance a laughing girl on knee— Ay, ay, you take me there; but see the obverse. 'S death, Sir, what say you to a midnight march, Through snow and sleet—no fire, no food, no wine: To plunge into a quagmire for a bed, Change female laughter for the cry of battle; For amorous encounters—ambushed foes; Groans for soft sighs, and sudden blows for kisses! CITIZEN. Methinks 't were best to stay at home. MUTIUS. For you, Sir, A most sagacious choice, and argues much Self-knowledge, meekness, and a sound discretion. For us—but pardon me, too long I lecture— It is a science abstruse and complicate, And needs the true vocation. (Crowd rushes past. CITIZEN (in passing.) Haste boys, haste, The Emperor hath passed the Hippodrome. 1ST CITIZEN. Good Captain, wilt thou see th' Ambassadors audience? 'Twill be a goodly shew. 2ND CITIZEN. Ay, and there is A grand procession of the Nazarenes. MUTIUS. The Nazarenes? Oh, ay, they would implore Augustus for indulgence. CITIZEN. That is their purpose; And Bishop Mark, the Emperor's old tutor, Means, at their head, to make a stout remonstrance. MUTIUS. I know him well, good masters. He should beware. When we saluted Julian first as Emperor, He was too much in the way. I can't afford To save his life twice. But lead on: I follow. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hall of State. Julian on his Throne. Maximus, Anatolius, Nevitta, Jovian, Sallust, Hormisdas, and Officers. (Enter at one side Nohordates and Meranes, Persian Ambassadors, attended. At the other side, Mark, Bishop of Arethusa, with ecclesiastics, in mourning.) JULIAN. Pass to the business of the day. ANATOLIUS. My Lord, Sundry petitions straight demand your care: Some trivial, some of weighty moment: each As may suit, demanding scrutiny. Here 's one from Caius Galba, a centurion, In the Prætorian band, seeking redress For loss in the popular tumults. Here 's another From the sixth legion, just arrived from Gaul, Craving free quarters in the suburbs. This Records complaint from Spain 'gainst the Proconsul, And there are many more here; a mixed multitude That may await more leisure. There are, however, Two of most pressing import: one, a memorial And solemn protest of the Christian church, Assembled here in Synod. They have deputed As advocate, Mark, Bishop of Arethusa. Here too are letters from the King of Persia Demanding audience for Ambassadors. JULIAN. Let Caius Galba have some recompense From our peculiar purse. The legion'ries Must take free quarters from an enemy: Pass them across the Hellespont. My Lords, I well believe that the Proconsul is A brave man and an honest: this complaint, Therefore, dismiss. Let the Ambassadors Of Sapor, King of Persia, speak their purpose. (Ambassadors approach in a haughty manner. ANATOLIUS. These, my imperial liege, are noble Satraps: Meranes, Nohordates; they are known In Roman story with advantage. MAXIMUS. Sirs, Your Persian air is sovereign for stiff necks; At Ctesiphon methinks you bow much lower: 'Tis needful and exacted too. JULIAN. Ambassadors, Speak quickly to your errand: we await, Being in haste, a speedy exposition. MERANES. The King sends greeting to Rome's General. NEVITTA. Slave! dost not know the title that earth's lord Bears on his throne? JULIAN. My good Nevitta, nay, It but awaits a bloody blazonry. Proceed— MERANES. We speak, Sir, but as messengers. Sapor demands why Julian hath transgressed The truce signed by the dead Constantius? Why Roman soldiers, from our swords redeemed To heal their wounds upon the lap of Peace, Affront our borders with their ransomed banners? Our Persian earth is sullied by their tread; Our Persian air is tainted by their breath. Lastly, we ask, (if Rumour's voice speak truly,) Why is the Nazarene disfranchised? Wherefore His altar and his home proscribed? JULIAN. Pause there, Sir: You have been forward in your questioning; Our answer shall be made in Ctesiphon. Yet say thus much: Rome to her chariot-wheel Hath bound barbarian Kings before. Enough— Begone. NOHORDATES. Sir, ere we do depart, it well becomes us, Who in true custody do hold the keys Of war and peace—solemn depositaries— To lift the veil that blinds you. Sir, I say It doth well suit strong valour to unfold Its armoury of strength, ere yet it strikes; And therefore we would open out the book Of time, and point the lessons of the past, And bid you read and profit ere we part. NEVITTA. (springing forward. Ha, Caitiff! say'st thou? JULIAN. (interposing. Nay, discourteous friend, Commit not thus our honour. MERANES. Roman Emperor! Wilt not vouchsafe reply? JULIAN. Ay, my good Lords— NOHORDATES. How, Sir? JULIAN. In blood and flames at Ctesiphon. (Shout from the populace. AMBASSADORS. We ask safe-conduct. JULIAN. 'Tis not needed. AMBASSADORS. Sir, We know not that. Our pledge? JULIAN. That you still live. (Populace shout again—the Ambassadors retire. And now, my friends, our hands are full methinks Of that we sought not, nor would shun. This enemy Hath a brave bearing, and is worth our pains. I love an open foe, in whose stern eye I read a character my own replies to. It is a stirring sight to see the sun Start back from some score thousand burnished helms, And angry flash from off the bright spear heads; And therefore I rejoice at this, and see in 't Glory, and much advantage to the State. And what, my Lords, advantages a State Like glory? 'Tis the very breath by which Society exists: the unseen bond That holds man to his duties: the bright chain That links him with a nobler nature. Fame Is not a faithless echo;—not the cry Of a vain moment, dying at the birth; But an enduring record, like the bow That looks out beautiful from desolate skies— The sun that aye renews the youthful year, And gives the promise of a harvest-home. Ah! these are thoughts to make our pulses play As Roman pulses should do. But hold, hold! Where do I lead? Why do I thus enkindle The generous glow I yet must damp? Oh, grief! Oh, shame! What shall I say? How teach my tongue To link our Roman names with treachery? Oh, foul, foul, foul! sold for barbarian gold, They give the kiss of peace with lying lips: They dreg the bowl of revelry with poison: They walk with daggers 'neath their cloaks, and pledge Friendship and faith, with hands upon the hilt. How shall we face the foe, when at our back Steals like a wolf the crouched domestic traitor? Thou, Maximus, can'st speak to this. MAXIMUS. Alas! My voice is needless to expose the traitors: Their own damn'd acts have damning witnesses. They 'll not impugn the evidence. My Lords, 'Twere fit the Bishop Mark had audience: He waits:—the fulness of his time hath come. ANATOLIUS. Call forth the Bishop of Arethusa. MAXIMUS. (Mark enters. Well, Sir, Your business, and that quickly: th' Emperor waits. MARK. Sir, I have waited long on him ere now, And as I hope, not all unprofitably. Young thoughts wear channels in the mind, and leave Impressions that time finds indelible. MAXIMUS. Pray you, good Bishop, we're on business: wear not Our time in idle declamation. MARK. Maximus, With thee I combat not. MAXIMUS. Bishop, be satisfied: I waste not strength on shadows, nor tread out The expiring embers of a sinking flame. We have no subject for dispute: the past To thee is a closed volume. MARK. Wretched man! Thou sayest true—the past to me is nought, Yet is it much to thee: an awful book Which thou shalt read by thy decaying lamp. But when the flame just brightens ere I die, My hope shall be the future. Thine—oh, where? JULIAN. When you have done with wrangling thus, remember Whose time you waste: I'm sick of this. MARK. Augustus! My heart was busy with too many sorrows To bear this vain man's taunting as I ought; As the humility of our faith teaches. JULIAN (not heeding him. 'Tis well remembered, Maximus. The fine Imposed on Antioch's contumacious prelate, See that 'tis levied. We have sudden need: This war begets much haste. MARK. Alas, alas! I come here sorrow-laden; in mine age Bowed down by more than age inflicts, to be The advocate of those who needed none, When I was young, and Julian poor, yet virtuous— Oh, Sir! JULIAN (not heeding him. Nevitta hearken: it were well To have a stout arm there—at Antioch. Direct our Gallic legionaries thither Under brave Dagalaiphus. MARK. (in agitation. Sir, my Sovereign! Oh, by a name yet dearer, my loved pupil, (If grandeur may remember infancy,) Here I kneel down to thee before I die, Here I adjure thee, as thou too must die, Add no new horrors to that hour! Oh, pity Thy subjects and thyself. JULIAN. (not heeding him. That Persian madman Will shew his mettle early. Jovian, go thou And from Sinope move our armaments Upon Trapezium. That disturbs their flank; We meet then on th' Euphrates. MARK. Nay, proud Monarch! May not I hold thine ear and altered eye With better hope than this? If thou art deaf To a nation's cry and blind to old affection, And lost to manhood's courtesy, I but Prophane the habit that I wear, the symbol Beneath which martyrs die to live, thus tamely To kneel to a clay idol! I pollute The fair fame of a Roman citizen To truck thus to a tyrant. Draw your poniards, Slaves, worthy of your master! Consummate Your infamy with cowardice, ye butchers! I know ye now: ye, who have struck the eagle, Why shrink ye from a wren? JULIAN. (to his Officers. Put up your swords; Your passionate zeal outruns your reason. What! Slay him beneath my eye? Men call that murder, Enacted thus with violence, which just judgment Might give a nobler name to. Hoary traitor, Know'st thou that paper? Read, and be dumb. MARK. (reads. I know not, Yet is my name in signature. I wrote it not. Can Maximus suggest? perchance— MAXIMUS. Thou liest! What, shall I stand thus taunted by a traitor? JULIAN. A paltry subterfuge! 'Tis but the struggle Of a condemn'd man. Now, my Lords, farewell— Make stern enquiries here. I must attend Subjects of deeper import. (Exit, attended. Manent Mark, Maximus, Nevitta, and Soldiers. MARK. Julian, my prince! Abandon not my grey hairs to these blood-hounds. Oh, stay: desert me not! He 's gone. MAXIMUS. Ay, priest, But fear not—I am merciful: the account Between us, as thou know'st, is long: thy fate Shall not be lingering. Methinks, Nevitta, Augustus hath betrayed a conscience Tender, as well befits a diadem. Beneath his eye no criminal must perish. Oh, no: thus would he seem unto the world Constructive executioner. 'Tis best thus. NEVITTA. Yet he admits the treason. MAXIMUS. And the judgment: He hath recorded judgment. Good Nevitta, He said but now departing that he left him To a condemned man's struggle. Said he not? NEVITTA. In truth I cannot charge my memory With the exact words: such they were, or seemed To that effect. MAXIMUS. We do interpret so. Heaven send us firmness in our duty! NEVITTA. Well, well, My path lies here: I doubt not, Maximus, Thou wilt acquit thy charge with prudence. Prisoner, Commend thee to thy gaoler. (Exit. MAXIMUS. (aside. Now must I do An act that Julian will not thank me for. His doubtful words are my sufficient warrant. This old man is a Christian, shrewd and virtuous, And holds strong place in his affection; therefore Must be removed, and quickly. Soldiers seize him. Old man, move forward. MARK. Whither? MAXIMUS. To a cell, Deep, dark, and narrow; yet a quiet one— A peaceful home. MARK. I understand: lead on. (Exeunt.</field>

Oh, soon: I heard but now the swell of music Come faintly up the street. It is so winding We catch but snatches: at the next turn you'll hear A glorious burst of sound. 1st. 'Tis a good deed Thus to revive our warlike ceremonies. 3rd. Like you this war, good neighbour? 1st. Nay, not I: Howbeit I come a gazer here. Not I— I have a son with the army; when he left me A raven flew thrice round his head. His mother Hath ever since been drooping. 3rd. And my daughter Is well nigh mad, at parting yesternight With her fond spouse, new wedded: there they loitered Beneath the cypress grove, bounding my garden, (Juno avert the omen,) till their young hearts Half broke with pain of parting. 2nd. Well, Sirs, for me I'm well content: being but a bachelor, I have small cares to thwart me. I am, therefore, Well pleased to hear of battles, and love glory. 1st. Has blood been spill'd yet? Heard you, friend? 3rd. 'Tis likely. The Prefect's vanguard had just passed the borders, Pushing for Perisabor. So said the messengers. 2nd. Then shall we hear of blows soon: I would wager By this our Cretan archers have essayed Their strong bows—and our horse of Thessaly Put forth their paces on the Syrian meadows. A sudden sound of music. 3rd. Gods! what a crash of music: here they come. Fall back, fall back, keep silence, and make way.

Thou God of our battles, and Lord of the war, Arise from thy slumber, awake in thy star! Come down in thy whirlwind of anger, and tread, Like a vision of wrath, o'er the field of the dead. The vulture is up on his shadowy wings, His plume like a hero's, his eye like a king's: The raven flies after with flap and with croak; He hath sprung from his branch of the blasted oak. Give breath to your trumpet, proud horseman, for, lo! Your war-steed hath started at sound of the foe; His nostrils are arched with impatience; his eye Hath a fire that will bear thee to conquer or die. Oh, lives there the recreant would linger? Avaunt! O'er the wide earth we'll hunt thee, with scoff and with taunt. Give death to the coward! yet no—let him live: What more to the good and the brave can we give? Then hail to thee, hail to thee, God of the brave! Firm trust of the Freeman, last hope of the Slave; Come down like a vision of wrath, and appear As the swell of the sea when a tempest is near. Descend in thy garment of doom and dismay, Like the pounce of the eagle that stoops to his prey, Like the flash that shoots down through the shadowy air, Like the spring of the lion when roused from his lair. MAXIMUS. (as Pontifex Maximus. Victorious Mars, bright God armipotent! Where'er thine eye looks terrible, where'er Thy blazing helm affrights the human heart, Avenger, hearken! For thy Julian kneels— Kneels at thy shrine. The sacrificial blood Steams grateful, as of old, upon thine altars. Lo, once again the renovated rites— Once more the vast procession throngs thy gates With angry shouts, to martial music marching. We cry for vengeance—hear, avenger, hear! He comes, he comes, amid yon golden clouds I see his glorious presence in the air. He comes, he comes! Lo, how his coursers strain Upon the impalpable air their sinewy limbs, Their eyes and swelling nostrils breathing fire. (Addressing Julian. Thou chosen warrior of the insulted Gods, Julian, imperial lord, receive the omen! Voices divine are murmuring in mine ear, Prophetic visions rise upon mine eye, And my heart swells with solemn augury. The Gods themselves look down from high Olympus, And smile upon thy battle; as of old By bards and prophets noted, still they mingle Their divine nature in our mortal quarrels, And vindicate their majesty on earth! Go, give thy bloody banners to the winds, Strew the polluted land with victims, crush With memorable vengeance! Thee, our temples Insulted and defiled, our dear Penates, Majestic oracles, and trampled altars, Invoke, and constitute their sacred champion! Arise, destroy. People shout.) Long live the Emperor! Long live our General! Julian lead to conquest. (Julian comes forward slowly. People shout.) Kind master, generous friend! God save thee, Julian! JULIAN. My friends, I thank you: yes, my friends ye are, To you I owe my throne—you have preserved it. Nor have I been ungrateful: bear me witness, When all our barriers, guarded by faint hearts, Were broken—and advantaged by the times The wild barbarian came like a flood upon ye, Whose standard then was foremost to the rescue? Whose red right hand redeemed your wasted fields— Your smoking homes? Who struck from savage grasp The uplifted sword, even at your children's throat? Tore from his arms the unviolated wife, And daughter still a virgin? Yes, they fled Our banners, as the vapour flies the sun-beam. And, oh! when gentle peace came like a bird, And spread her fond wings over us, my sway Fell on you lightly, as the wholesome dew— Where'er the yoke lay sore, old imposts pressed, I smote them with reforming zeal, and poured Oil on your wounds, and cherished you to health. Now once again does harsh necessity Clothe us in sullen armour. Gods approve Our enterprise. The mighty oracles Have spoken with the voice of destiny! You too, my people, by this acclamation Fiat our purpose, and invest your prince With more than regal terrors. Is 't not so? (People shout Draw then yuor swords, bold youth—to arms, to arms— As ye do trust to clasp unravished brides, As ye do hope to see connubial pledges, As ye would still inherit from your sires Sweet homes, untrodden by tumultuous war, I call ye forth to arms. People shout.) Lead on, lead on To victory—Julian and victory! (Julian comes forward with his train. JULIAN. And now, kind friends, (how pleasant 'tis to be Environ'd by a living ring of friends) We have begun with glorious presages. Call in the Prefect's messenger. Well, Sir, (Enter Messenger. Repeat your errand. How stand our armies? OFFICER. Bravely. The Master-General of the frontier, Jovian, Hath joined our Prefect, Sallust, with his power, And crossed the border merrily. We've had Some sharp encounters and displayed high valour; Made many captives and much booty: gained Opinion, confidence, and happy omens. JULIAN. What say you to the foe? OFFICER. They 've lost all heart, And at the very terror of our name Retreat distractedly; abandoning Honour and hope, with more substantial things. 'Tis thought, brave Dagalaiphus, by his march Toward th' Euphrates' springs threatning their rear, Secured our daring progress. JULIAN. 'Twas foreseen, Sir And now, good comrades, to your posts.

      <field name="fulltext">The Mines under Perisabor—Workmen hewing the rock —the roof supported by a large pillar of rough wood. Enter Nevitta and Officers. NEVITTA. Is your work finished yet? WORKMAN. In truth, Sir, 'Twas a hard job, but there 's the finishing stroke. NEVITTA. Then is our battle-hour arrived—call forward The gallants that lead up the storm. (Enter Soldiers, with battle-axes and shields, &amp;c. After them Julian, Maximus, &amp;c. &amp;c.) NEVITTA. The moments press—when shall we give the signal? JULIAN. Hold! I have sent in a last summons. Jovian Returns on the instant: here he comes. Enter Jovian. JOVIAN. Alas! Sir, These men are mad—most obstinately mad! They yield not, but return most wild defiance. Yet are they worn out sadly. Empty streets And grass-grown portals are more eloquent Than any language; and the lean, shadowy shapes, That glance at times across the silent courts, Make most emphatic comment. MAXIMUS. Why, 'twould be mercy To terminate their misery. JOVIAN. And yet, There are some that still cling to life. I passed The gate of a temple: it was thronged with maidens Worn out with famine doubtless, but still lovely. And there they sat, and sang, and wept, and told Sad stories, and then wept again. I saw In an open hall, an old man of fourscore By his daughter fed on their last loaf—their last: Ay, o'er that meal he blessed her, and held up His aged hands, and wished her length of days, And health, and happiness: thus on the edge Of a sure grave! I turned away mine eyes, And in a corner saw a young man steal The cool spring draught from his faint, dying mother, And drink:—thus misery deforms our nature! MAXIMUS. Nay Jovian, nay—time presses us—anon We can hear this at leisure: and, if you please it, Weep till our hearts break, at your dolorous stories. Postpone, postpone. JULIAN. Priest! you may have no heart; I have: Jovian proceed. Aught else? JOVIAN. We soldiers Have but hard hearts at best; yet there was one That moved my pity deeply—a poor female. Famine had preyed upon her, and it seemed As if some grief had left her desolate. She had a baby in her arms, and moved Slow, with unsteady step, her head declining. She heard me as she passed, and languidly Stopped, and, all trembling, turned aside to gaze. Oh, what a look she gave then! her dim eyes, Sunk in their livid chambers, and half hid 'Neath the incumbent lids, were fixed on me With most intense, painful anxiety. Tears started, and she turned unto her child, Kissed it and wept; then turned to me again, And seemed with her disparted lips to drink E'en the least word I uttered. There was about her An air that shewed she had been beautiful, And knew it—and a something that denoted Station and breeding; and she still was youthful. But Nature vainly wars with sickness: thus Want had anticipated time—the sear Of sallow winter crept upon her roses, And hunger made her soft cheek hollow and wan. JULIAN. Oh, war, remorseless war! poor gentle creature, Did she not shrink from thee at last? JOVIAN. Alas! Despair and sensibility soon sever. Squalid had grown her dress—her breast was bare, That infant's fount of life and only pillow. As thus she looked on me, her baby cried, (Haply at being unnoticed,) and stretched out His little hands, and wound them round her neck, And stroked down her poor cheek. Thereat she turned And gazed upon it wildly, and sank down Upon her knees and prayed; and to her bosom Clasped it, and hung her head and wept aloud. (Julian sits down and covers his face with his hand. MAXIMUS. (regarding Julian. Nay, if he feels it thus, we are ruined. Give me The axe and I will tear the mine down. (He takes the axe. Soldiers! Remember how you are moulded. Youth of Greece, Fight for the honour of old Hellas. Think Of Marathon in th' onset; and if any Talk of retreat, cry out Thermopylæ. And you, Pretorians! now your Thracian wives Are gather'd in the Hippodrome, high vaunting The prowess of their husbands. Men of Italy! Inheritors of victory! Proud Romans! Your country sees you from the Capitol. Charge, and the Gods be with you. (He strikes the base of a column, which giving way, the mine falls in, and above the mass of ruin the interior of the city is seen. Citizens rush to the breach with wild cries. Assault and repulse. Julian starts up, drawing his sword.) JULIAN. Is the deed done? Then Romans do your duty. (The breach is at length won. The troops pour into the city.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">View of Ctesiphon. Troops pass. Enter Nevitta, Anatolius, Hormisdas, &amp;c. NEVITTA. We have had stout marches and a gallant struggle; But there 's the goal at last. Hail, Ctesiphon! In sooth, Hormisdas, you have more taste, you Persians, Than I had credited. ANATOLIUS. 'Tis a fair prospect; Those temples standing out in light, from groves, With all their pediments and porticos Glowing amid the sober cypresses, Look from their hills into the glassy river Like beauty on her mirror. With what grace Those accidental shadows from light clouds Partially veil the distant mass o' the city, Breaking it to intelligible parts; Each by its dome, column, or arch of triumph, Reveal'd to the discriminating sun With an appropriate beauty. HORMISDAS. My eyes fill To see thee thus, and hear thee praised—my country! Yet hast thou been a step-dame unto me. ANATOLIUS. Why dost thou look with that sardonic smile, Nevitta, on this goodly scene? Why, man, If 'twere a virgin trembling on thy knee Thy leer could scarce be more portentous. NEVITTA. Ha, ha! Thou talk'st oracularly. It is a scene That stirs up my barbarian blood within me; My Gallic veins do bound again. ANATOLIUS. I take it now, Thy thoughts are with forlorn hopes, hot onsets, Bloody repulses, glorious rallyings; Torn standards, flying foes, victorious cries; The strife from street to street, and foot to foot; And then the final sack—hot tongues of fire Licking the fair walls of yon' palaces— Their steps well strewn with the rich harnessed dead, Their portals thronged with booty. Then, fair matrons Clinging to altars, with their timorous brood Of loose-haired virgins crouching down around them, Like scared birds, when the hand is on the nest. NEVITTA. Soothsayer! thou read'st my eyes, like stars; Hormisdas Thou tak'st this gloomily. HORMISDAS. Would'st have me smile Upon my country's desolation? Think thou— Picture Lutetia thus. NEVITTA. Well, Sir, suppose it— And sixty thousand Persians at the leaguer. HORMISDAS. Would you then smile? NEVITTA. Ay, Sir, and that I should; To think how the accommodating fools Had come so far to take our yoke—recruits, Anticipating slaves, to man our gallies. HORMISDAS. Hold! though I be an exile, a poor orphan, Untimely severed from my parent soil; Think you that I 'm so heartless as to hear The voice of scorn unmoved? Am I so mean Of lip and arm not to resent it? Gaul! I love my country, and I have a sword That shall protect us both from insult. NEVITTA. Give me Thy hand, brave man: I wronged thee, and repent it. But see—here 's Maximus, that prince of plotters. I ne'er can read him rightly: he is ever Clothed in his natural shadows. What now conceits him? Good day t' ye, Priest: what news hast thou? MAXIMUS. Rough soldier, None that concerneth thee. NEVITTA. Whence com'st thou from? MAXIMUS. The imperial quarters. ANATOLIUS. How doth the Emperor? MAXIMUS. Well, Sir. NEVITTA. Why, Priest, thou hast been tutor'd by an augur. Thou art as economical of words As any oracle. HORMISDAS. His mind is full then. When stars are thick in the sky, then is there silence. MAXIMUS. Hast heard of this new Persian fugitive? Hormisdas! crave your pardon: I was ignorant Of your much-honoured presence. HORMISDAS. Be at ease, Sir; You touch not me. NEVITTA. What! he that hath the bloody scalp? Oh, ay, This new Zopyrus? He has been closetted These two hours with the Emperor. A spy! MAXIMUS. Humph! say you so? Cæsar thinks otherwise. There 's mischief in that firebrand soldier's eye. (Aside. Nevitta, I would speak with you. My Lords, Behold how beautiful is Ctesiphon! That treasury of unimagined sweets, Whose very key we hold: the consummation That tip-toe hope steps like a bridegroom to. NEVITTA. Most eloquent prophet! MAXIMUS. Nay, Nevitta, these Are but most false temptations. Let us to council. The Emperor may need advice: his sorrows Grow thick upon him. ANATOLIUS. Ah, the poor Empress! soon Her weariness will find a bed of rest: We pitch her tent this evening here. MAXIMUS. Perhaps For the last time—the last! This grief o'erwhelms him, Shadowing the light of his mind. Now, Sirs, these moments Are pregnant with Rome's fate. Again I say There lies fair Ctesiphon—but, shall we plant The limits of our conquest here? or rather Shall we not bravely pluck the Persian down From his last hold of refuge? NEVITTA. Is it not there— The last, the noblest? MAXIMUS. Oh, Sirs, do you dream That Sapor there coops up his hopes? Even now His march is in the desert. Far he flies, Wild as the tiger from the toils: and shall not The hunter track his foot-prints? Ay, 'tis his hope That Ctesiphon may prove our Capua. NEVITTA. Why speak you thus? MAXIMUS. This spy—this new Zopyrus, As you are pleased to call him, but, as Julian (Wherefore I need not now descant upon) Deems a most trusty witness:—(and his wrongs Speak in his favour)—this poor fugitive Persian But last night saw their rear-guard pass the gate— And there were troops of virgins in their train, (Mark that Nevitta,) and rich caravans, Piled with the wealth o' the city: which now lies A cheat, a sorry trap, a rifled coffer, A cup, whereof the very lees are drained. You muse, Nevitta. NEVITTA. At your story, Maximus— If it be true— ANATOLIUS. If but in part 'tis true— NEVITTA. I know a soldier's duty. MAXIMUS. Come to the Emperor, Rome conquers Sapor now, or fails for ever. (Exeunt Nevitta, Anatolius, &amp;c. MAXIMUS. Now is the bark of Maximus afloat, Cresting ambition's topmost wave—and bravely Doth she acquit her prowess to the storm! Yet is th' adventure dangerous, and needs A bold and wary pilotry. Take counsel— Take counsel, Maximus, with thy subtlest thoughts. How stand thy fortunes? What I seem, I am not; Nor am I what I was, and shall be. Men Envy my greatness, nor conceive it frail. Yet many wish it so:—therein lies danger. If I once fall, how many knees, now bending, Would stamp the heel of hate into my breast: Ay, spit their venom on this loathed form! Take counsel, Maximus. Thy lofty stand Is as the eagle's, in the eye o' th' sun. But is 't secure? Or, rather, know'st thou not, That even now it fails thee? Julian—no matter Whether it be he needs me not—or whether, Even in the full fruition of the crime, Guilt fears his tempter: or—(why, what's't to me?) But, ever since I did that deed on Mark, I have been shunned. Sapor, what sayest thou? “He need not seek the favour of a king That may be king himself.” Subtle barbarian! Yet was not this my aim: I sought but power, Nor grasped I at the vanity of things. I leant on Julian—with his growth I grew: ('Twas my best hope of rising) now am I shorn Of that which had contented me, and therefore Again take counsel for advancement. Sapor— Yes, I will lead this Julian to thy toils. So, if he triumphs, I partake the glory, And may resume my sway: but if he fails— Oh! if there 's faith in plots, or zeal in men For their imagined interests—then, Julian, The laurel that now wreaths thy warrior-brow, Shall make pacific diadems for mine.

Madam, the Empress (To Eusebia. Is much too slight a flower for these rough days. Her head bows down, untimely withering, Like a displanted herb in summer drought. These warlike toils and strange disquietudes Suit not her tender nature. EUSEBIA. 'Tis too true. How wan she looks—how falteringly she moves. Mark too her eye—there, where the buoyant spirit Should glance his radiant banner, the drooped fringes Hang like the scutcheons of a broken heart. ANATOLIUS. Then is she broken hearted! The night star Looks not more faded when the morning dawns, Than she, thus at the gate of opening Heaven. The heaviness of doom is on her. Oh, Fate hath a solemn language speaking thus! Madam, will 't please you to alight? We 've now (To Constantia. Closed our day's journey. CONSTANTIA. Thou say'st true: our journey (And mine has been a weary and a sad one,) Is like to have swift termination. Let me look round once more: from this high seat The eye hath 'vantage. 'Tis a goodly scene— Yon river, like a silvery snake, lays out His coil i' th' sunshine lovingly—it breathes Of freshness in this lap of flowery meadows. How call you this, my lord? ANATOLIUS. The famous Tigris. CONSTANTIA. 'Tis worthy of report: worthy to have been The scite of empire, nurse of the human race, And place of mighty actions! Was it not here The fathers of mankind, the Patriarchs, Dwelt with their flocks—Abraham and Israel? Was it not here the wise Chaldean shepherd Leaned on his staff and watched the stars at night? Here too (as holy legends tell) stretched beautiful The paradise of innocence—the home Of Eve and Adam, ere they sinned: and here The iron age had birth. Power first put on His gauntlet, and earth shook beneath his tread. This is the soil of tyranny: the land Is rank with much pollution. Proud Assyrian, Where is thy Babel now—thy Nineveh? Thy temples and thy palaces, and gates That poured the tide of men? It is the tomb Of nations that we tread on: the vast charnel Of grandeur—yet without a monument! The works of man are like himself, vain dust: Nothing but fame, or good or ill, endures. EUSEBIA. Oh, hear her—look on her! so sad, so earnest. How grand, yet awful, is decaying nature! Conscious of fate, yet fearless—casting on all A light, like that of evening, when the shades Lie deepest. Sweet Constantia, sit you down: So,—they have smoothed your mantle on this bank Here, in the sun for you. Are you not tired? This rest is sweet. CONSTANTIA. Oh, I am sick at heart! My spirit like its feeble frame. Yes, yes, The bed of rest is smoothed for me. I never Shall taste of trouble more. EUSEBIA. Nay, now you trifle With our affections, dearest. CONSTANTIA. Think not so. Look on me as a prophetess. My sight Is purged: gleams of another world pass over me, And I am as the dead. I know it—know it. Already half the vital heat is gone— Look on me as a prophetess: Cassandra, Unheeded in her wilderness of mind; In her extreme despair cut off; yet truly Telling of woe and ruin. Oh, I shall be Deep in the ground and feel it not. EUSEBIA. Sweet daughter, Pray you suppress these thoughts. CONSTANTIA. Where lingers Julian? My eyes have not looked on him as they should do, Now that they have not long to look. His duties Are not so pressing, but that he might give Some hours of comfort to a parting soul; Who for his sake alone loves life. Where is he? I have the fearful longing—my short breath Comes quick with much anxiety. Sweet angels! Take me not to you till my soul hath seen him, And poured its bitterness forth in parting tears Upon his neck, forgiving, blessing, comforting!

      <field name="fulltext">A wood—Camp in distance—Moonlight. Enter Maximus. The moon has passed the midnight; the hour is past That Nohordates pledged: would it were over! How calm it is! no sounds come through the air, Though they might pass the impalpable element Like light through the clear deep of waters. I Would rather front the whirlwind of the desert, Or voice of thunder with its wild concomitants, Lightning and swelling winds and sheeted rains, Than this placidity of Nature. Gazing Thus on yon stedfast stars I could half fancy That supernatural eyes looked down on me From the calm depth of Heaven: and this breathless Pause in the world's life, seems as if all earth Was hushed, that not a sound might interrupt The ear of the omnipresent Deity. Why is it thus with me? I have been wont To meet all dangers with an equal eye. I have been stedfast to my mighty aim, And have made kings my puppets; and religion A game, through which I grasp a glorious stake. I have well weighed my species, and assayed Their worth, and coined them for mine own good ends. All are my tools, and I have laughed at all! Then wherefore do I feel oppressed? That madman, Cyrus in aim, shall be in fate Cambyses: And like a skilful alchymist, I draw Good from his evil—from his woe my weal; From Rome's debasement my advancement:—Good. So I am fortune's minion, and hold fate Reined like a mettlesome steed. I do but lack This consummation, and the world is mine! What care I for opinion?

How so, my Lord? NOHORDATES. I slew him! Ay, ay, I deemed him treacherous. Nay—start not, We 're hasty reasoners in this land o' th' sun; Quick in our passions, sudden in our anger. Why muse you? he was but a bondsman. MAXIMUS. Satrap, I will be plain: 'tis not the deed disturbs me, Nor the condition of the victim, but The breach of faith this argues. I could pardon A salutary violence for great ends; But petty treachery, to wreak despite, Or sooth a vain fear, that I cannot brook. Sir, answer not: I'm deep read in men's minds. Excuse I wave—your anger I regard not. NOHORDATES. Well, Maximus, you 're master of your thoughts; Yet let me say, I 'd aim my shaft again At higher game, upon less provocation. And now to business. MAXIMUS. (aside. Raise the earth-worm up, And he will threat. 'Tis his mean nature speaks, And not the King who sent him. Yet, 'twere well To pause. NOHORDATES. My Lord, you seem dissatisfied. If aught from my poor lip disquiets you, Think it unsaid. Freely do I disclaim Words, that so ill give utterance to my heart. My sovereign sends his gentlest greeting to you; Health, riches, power, rank, glory; whatsoe'er Ambition grasps at, or desert secures. MAXIMUS. Much have I now, and thank not him: but softly, King Sapor promised—(for men cannot be Too strict, explicit, circumspect, when matters Of such high import are at issue)—Sapor Did pledge his signature on certain points Conditional to our true amity, To save all future cavil. Your credentials? NOHORDATES. Behold! Peruse these presents; and besides, As earnest of the love he holds you in, He sends this jewel from his hand. MAXIMUS. A bauble! Had I a thought for things like these, the worth Of thrones had decked my person. I seek not That whose sole value is conventional: Power is intrinsic, and commands all else. That is the heaven my eagle-wing ascends, The sun my eye out-dazzles. (He reads) I've perused This paper, and am satisfied. NOHORDATES. Then quickly Say, for night wanes, have you prepared the troops? MAXIMUS. Yes, certain officers. The common men Love Julian: but there are some I have found Whose merits, as they judge, have been ill-weighed; Men of some breeding—none more dangerous, And ripe for any mischief: they are prepared. Now, mark me: he that to our camp this morning Came as a fugitive, was well received. He played his hook well, and the bait was swallowed. We raise our leaguer of proud Ctesiphon, And plunge into the desert after you: Be wary and we 'scape not the decoy. NOHORDATES. Oh, fear not—we shall fly you like the sand Swept by the breeze; till, with its mighty arm, The storm collects its pillars. Then we crush you. (Exit. MAXIMUS. I care not whom you crush, so I am raised. Here is my firm assurance— (regarding the paper I have no choice left. I cannot still be as I am: my web Hath been too finely spun with Julian; soon He cuts it with the sword. And he hath cause, For I have been his evil genius; made His conscience but a stepping-stool; and fashioned My fortunes by his foibles. He hath been My slave mechanical, my artizan, Whom now, his labour done, I would discharge. The chain hath galled of late, and he hath chaf'd, And wreaked on me his humours.

We 've gallants here Whose valour does not need discouragement. HORMISDAS. I've done; but yet you know my mind—believe it. You may unhorse us often, but on this ground We shall arise refreshed. NEVITTA. Then we must strangle you As in the grasp of Hercules Antæus. (Soldiers press forward again. MUTIUS. We have consulted, Generals, and plant here Our standards. We will go no farther. Enter Julian. JULIAN. Say you so? And who, my talkative friend, art thou? Nay, man, Having o'erleaped the mark, like a shamed panther Shrink not back, crouching with a cowardly growl: Mutius, stand forth. I know you, Sir, of old; A man of dangerous wit and turbulent speech; Yet loyal, as I deemed, which your promotion Doth testify. Come, Sir, speak out:—I wait. MUTIUS. Cæsar, as deputy of these brave comrades, I will speak, and as doth become a soldier. (Soldiers shout and clash their arms. We have fought and conquered for you, and we think Our toils should have a limit. JULIAN. Gentle spokesman, For Heaven's sake have a care. I'm quick of temper, And fearless in decision, as you know. I have a private grief too that lies heavy Upon my temper—tempt me not. SOLDIERS (from the crowd. Brave Mutius, Speak to our grievance, we 'll support you. MUTIUS. Emperor! We love you: but our farthest march is made— We go no farther. JULIAN (drawing his sword, and cutting Mutius down. Be it so—who next Tries the adventure of an orator? (A pause—all remain silent. SALLUST (aside. For Heaven's sake, treat them cautiously. JULIAN. Away! I do despise these demagogues, that fret The angry multitude: they are but as The froth upon the mountain-wave—the bird That shrieks upon the sullen tempest's wing. (Julian whispers Nevitta, who departs. JULIAN. You dreamed I could be awed by words. Know, soldiers, No mortal voice or arm has power o'er Julian. Stir not a man: fall back into the ranks: Take up your mutinous officer. (Two of the Soldiers remove Mutius to the side. I 'm glad You are so changed o' th' sudden: would that the foe Were near us! By Bellona, I could lead you Now 'gainst a host of spears. Ha! see you there. (A sudden flash of fire from a ship. The flame runs from ship to ship till the entire fleet is in a blaze.) Breathe not a sound, for honour's sake, brave comrades; No, not a murmur, on your duty:—now You have no choice left, all retreat 's cut off. We now must fight our way to peace. Brave hearts, Are not these Persians and those fields the same That quaked beneath the Boy of Macedon? And what were he (though half our strength) if boldly He had not plunged into the dark Granicus? Soldiers of Rome! what, shall our sons grow pale Reading that Grecian story? then for shame Blush at their fathers' mem'ry? We can die, And laugh at death upon the field of glory, But live as recreants—never! Good Sallust, see that wounded man hath care. I loved him, though I stabbed him for his crime: I hope not mortally. Soldiers, to arms! Hormisdas, lead them to their quarters. March. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interior of Imperial tent—Constantia on a couch— Julian kneeling beside her. Enter Eusebia, cautiously. JULIAN. Hush! she sleeps. Hush! EUSEBIA. Hath she not wakened since? Taken no nourishment? JULIAN. No: since you left us She hath been thus. She breathes, you see she breathes. EUSEBIA. Faintly and much oppressed. JULIAN. Yet, yet, she breathes: She lives, I say, Eusebia, and will live. Look not thus on me: make me not mad! nay, touch her; You need not fear disturbing her. This stupor Portends a crisis. True, the pulse is feeble, And fluttering—but the pulse is there: her hand Is cold and damp, but there is motion in it. She pressed my hand just now as if she knew me; Nay, stoop down to her lip—kiss, but awake her not. (Eusebia kisses her. They 're cold—but have some colour yet! I thought This moment as I pressed them, a swift hectic Hurried across her cheek; but now how pale— How deadly wan it looks! EUSEBIA. Indeed 'Twere best if you withdrew. JULIAN. Eusebia, I quit her not while there is breath, pulse, heat! (He gazes wildly on Constantia. I like not the look of her eye, beneath the lid— Is your hand cool, Eusebia? Lay it here Upon my brow—that burns. My brain is seared, My mind is numbed—is numbed. Yet in my heart There is a recklessness. Why, I could laugh now! Is it not strange? EUSEBIA. For mercy's sake be calm! JULIAN. Why, so I am. Do you not see me calm? As cold and passionless as any statue— Still, as the breathless pause before an earthquake. EUSEBIA. She moves—thank God, thank God! Virgilia, Haste with the cordial: it refreshes her— Put it again to her lips. Wipe her damp forehead: She is revived. CONSTANTIA. Julian! my husband, Julian! Oh, Julian, Julian, come to me. Off, off— You kill me with this weight. EUSEBIA. See him, my love. Your Julian 's at your side; nor hath he quitted it All this long night. CONSTANTIA. Let me look once more on him, A film is on my sight, (endeavouring to see him. Oh, my best love! Thy lineaments are in my heart, or scarcely Could I now trace them. JULIAN. Blessed woman! tear not My heart with too much fondness now. CONSTANTIA (regarding him fixedly. Indeed? Then are my moments numbered! (pause. Let me bethink me— Thoughts come on thoughts, crowding across my mind Like shadows lengthening in the sunset. God! Must I be gathered in my youth, and lie Lonely, forgotten, in a foreign grave? And shall I leave none after me, to strew My early tomb with wild flowers, wet with tears? No little hands, no limbs of mine own mould, Memorials of my lineage, sweet pledges Of our affections—living comforters To him who lives, for her who died! No, no. Barren—I sink into this barren clay, My worldly pomp cast to a nameless grave, My beauty prey to the despoiling worm, My human love dead in my mortal dust, My heavenly hopes and my immortal soul Asleep till the last trumpet! Yet had I hoped— (Julian, my husband, kiss me once again) Yet had I hoped—and oft we talked of this— To have seen my offspring on its father's knee: So had I left a living portraiture, Whose instinct of true love had been to thee A solace and a memory. JULIAN. (distractedly. I cannot bear this. (He rushes out of the tent. CONSTANTIA. Oh, this is worse for him to bear than me, But he will not stay from me? EUSEBIA. Surely not: He will but weep, as we do now, aside; And so, being calmed, return. CONSTANTIA. My time is short. Let him not stay—'twould be an agony, That fruitlessly would haunt his after-thoughts, That he had 'reft my transitory hour Of aught that could have soothed a dying pang. VIRGILIA. Already he returns— CONSTANTIA. Thank God, thank God! Oh, what a change two years, short years, have made! That was my bridal time. We had long loved, But knew it not—in both it was love's spring; And we were young enthusiasts: we felt, As our minds mingled, that our souls were wed. One morn, thus linked in thought, as side by side We sat, his arm around my waist, my hands Clasped on his shoulder, and my tearful eye Looking on his, perchance too lovingly; He spoke to me of love: and as he spoke Young roses, born of love and modesty, Fell on his cheek:—I blushed to see his blushing EUSEBIA. My child, you seem revived; a gentle colour Hath touched your cheek o' th' sudden. CONSTANTIA. 'Tis the rally Of the spirit to support its trial: even as The last light on the mountain top, before The sun goes down. My maidens, to your tenderness I yield this mortal form. Regard it as Th' unsullied tenement of a pure mind, If not a strong one. Give it decent rites, And guard it from rude gaze—no more, he comes. My Julian! (tenderly. Enter Julian. JULIAN. I could half give way to hope Thus gazing on thee. (kneels beside her) Some new animation Gleams in thy late dim eyes. Speak comfort to me. CONSTANTIA. There is no comfort on this earth but one: Wilt thou reject it? There is no hope else, Julian, For you and me. I will not now deceive thee: Even now, all but my mind and love are dead. The death-chill creeps up gently to my heart And that will soon be cold—cold as my limbs. (Julian exhibits passionate grief. My poor, my desolate love, be calm and hear me. Death to the righteous is not terrible! The dust may perish, but the nobler essence Hath an eternal surety. Oh, let me Close my poor eyes, in hope to open them With thee in a better world! Our parting thus Shall lose its sting—parting to meet again. Give me this hope, my Julian. It is agony, Even the suspense: oh, thou wert strong in virtue, And shalt be yet. As thou hast fallen, repent! Repent—and God is merciful! One moment more, sweet Heaven! I cannot see— I cannot hear thee—give me a sign—a kiss— In token of— JULIAN. Upon thy dying lips, Thou blessed saint, I pledge my prostrate soul. CONSTANTIA. Now I die happy—remember! (She reclines back, folding her hands as in prayer, her eyes closed.) EUSEBIA. Sing her that hymn, That she once loved, she yet perchance may hear it; She is not dead, but sleeps. Chorus of Virgins. Gentle spirit, that would'st fly, Seraph, through the pathless sky; Winging onward to thy rest, Like a wild bird to its nest; As thou art without offence, Peaceful be thy passage hence! Go, and happy souls befriend thee, And thy virtues shall attend thee. Now, assoiled from mortal taint, Take thy blessed way, sweet saint, Through the spheres by angels trod, To the presence of thy God! All are doomed to death; but all Shall wake at the last trumpet call— The past recall'd, the dead arrayed; And then the world itself shall fade— But not all with it. The pure spirit Shall the crown of life inherit! Spirit, in thy virtue free, Peaceful may thy passage be!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An open Grove; beyond which, over a screen of underwood, is seen a sandy desert. Enter tumultuously groups of Soldiers, worn as if by long travelling. After them, Nevitta, Jovian, and other Officers, expostulating. Then Maximus. NEVITTA. Shame on you! By glorious Mars! comrades, I shame to see you Why, scarce a week since and ye laughed to scorn These paltry Persians. You were as weary then With toiling through these deserts, as ye now are. Stand to your arms I say, cowards! or forfeit Your Roman name for ever. MAXIMUS. They are brave, Sir, As you or any man: I will avouch it Spite of your ready frown. Ay, is the scene Unchanged indeed? These wastes were wild and lonely Before, as they are now: but we could brave them When marching to imagined victory. Now— A SOLDIER. Why, look there, my masters: look at yon' track Lined out along the desert by our ruin. What see you there? dead horses, dying men, Women, that to the shattered carriages Cling shrieking—and afar the coming spoiler! Here do we stand the while, poor worn anatomies, Fit for death only. MAXIMUS. 'Tis too true, Nevitta. We have been cozened, ideots as we were, By flatterers, madmen, traitors. SOLDIER. Why are we here? Seek Sapor in the desert? Ye should have known it Before ye risked men's lives. A lonely traveller Upon that drear expanse, picks up with pain A scanty meal. Ay, the half-loaded camel Falters beneath the burning atmosphere. MAXIMUS. True, my poor fellow, true. We are stout soldiers, But perishable men. NEVITTA. As soldiers, therefore, Hearken to me—leave cowards to repine O'er our undoubted evils. Yonder 's the foe, Come on, brave hearts: let 's toss these baiting curs As bulls do from their horns. MAXIMUS. My counsel, comrades, Is peace, is peace. Why should we perish? wherefore? To sooth the vanity of one rash man? The hot air smells of carnage—shall we die On points of ceremony? NEVITTA. Art thou mad? Be silent: you unman us, when we need Firm courage most. MAXIMUS. I say, 'tis peace we need— Bread, water, sleep. These now were worth an empire. (A trumpet sounds. NEVITTA. Now, if there 's half a Roman heart among you, To arms, to arms! stand to the foe. (Persian cavalry gallop, shouting beyond the bank of underwood.) Voices within. A spring! A spring, a spring! water—a spring, a spring! (Soldiers all rush to the side. Enter Julian. JULIAN. Oh, brave companions! Where would they fly, Nevitta? NEVITTA. They have found a spring. (Maximus retires. JULIAN. Is this a time? hold, hold! Romans! dear comrades of a thousand fields, Return—the foe 's upon us. Soldiers, soldiers! Shame not our ancient glories—face to the enemy. What, will you leave your General? By the Gods! I plant my foot here, be 't for life or death. Now, if you dare, abandon me. Dear friends, I know your better feelings. (Soldiers gather round him and applaud, clashing their arms.) We 'll lash these jackalls Back to their desert: then, oh, then! how sweetly Will taste these waters to our weariness. Tumultuous cry of Soldiery.) A charge! huzza, huzza! Julian, Julian! (All rush off the scene; clash of arms and shouts. The Persians fly back, pursued.) Re-enter Julian, Nevitta, &amp;c. JULIAN. Thanks, gallants, we have bravely chidden them— Bravely. Now where 's the spring? a clear, cool draught Of water trickling from a rock, or gushing Its bubbling way through the green grass, were worth Beakers of wine at the full board of peace. (Soldier brings in water—offers it to Julian. JULIAN. No, my good friend, no. While a man of you Thirsts, not a drop for me: my brave Nevitta, Drink thou. Nay, I command. You, Anatolius, And you, and you, and you—so, my turn next. A brimming helmet, mind ye. NEVITTA. Oh, Sir, thus ever To our wants you postpone your own: ay, ever. Heaven shield us from ingratitude! JULIAN. Amen! But some there are—I had one in my eye Even as I entered. NEVITTA. Ah, the hypocrite! JULIAN. No more—but keep an heedful eye upon him. The day is come, Nevitta, when we shall need Our noblest energies. Then 'ware all traitors! Here is a glorious field to act war's tragedy. We 've won a night of rest: hail to a morning Of final, desperate strife. NEVITTA. Thanks to the Gods! I hear of battle once more. (A Soldier brings water to Julian. JULIAN. Comrade, your hand: I thank you: ay, that draught is pure and wholesome. I am a man again. Where 's Anatolius? Ha, Anatolius! (to him, entering.) Dagalaiphus—all, I 'm glad we meet. Eusebia—where is she? ANATOLIUS. Her tent is safe beside the welcome springs: She has a noble courage. JULIAN. It was ever so. Look to her, Anatolius, when I'm gone. ANATOLIUS. Oh, Cæsar, wherefore? JULIAN. Nay, nay, let that rest. Old Sallust, in these gorges, we confront The peril, like bold Romans. SALLUST. Our thin ranks May here make head—here only. JULIAN. Sallust, I feel A weight beyond my sorrows in my heart: If aught befal me—well, well—only thus much; Should I fall, choose the worthiest. Now to our tent. To each I give his charge, and then good night, And may sweet sleep restore you. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Morning—a Camp in the mountains. Soldiers before the imperial tent. Enter Nevitta, Hormisdas, Anatolius, Sallust. NEVITTA. The sun will soon arise: yon dusky mountain Lifts his great outline hard against the light. There are no clouds, the air is crisp and jocund, And rosy fingers now are shaking out Aurora's golden hair. SALLUST. 'Tis strange to think With what indifference does our mother Nature Behold this worldly stage. She sits unmoved While nations are extinguished, kings dethroned, The temples of the Gods subverted. Equal To her our joys or sorrows—they are but shadows Passing and pass'd, upon the glass of time! Yet, is not this a day when she might drop Some tears, and clothe her limbs in darksome weeds? For now two nations meet in mortal quarrel, Two crowned brows frown terrible defiance, Two mighty armies crowd one narrow field, Two faiths contend for empire. NEVITTA. Hark, I hear The adverse trumpets sounding, and the clash Of cymbals, echoing through those winding mountains. They speed a gallant summons. ANATOLIUS. Has the Emperor Yet risen? Who has seen him? He should wake Haply from his last slumber. SOLDIER. Hush, my lord: Great Julian sleeps not; all this morn I heard His step in motion, and he sometimes came, All pale and solemn, to the tent door and gazed Upon the stars. Once, as I paced aside, His eye seemed wet—it had a wat'ry sparkle. OFFICER. The sentinel that walked the midnight watch Tells a strange tale. The Emperor slept alone, Yet were two voices heard within the tent At the dead silent hour. SOLDIER. Ay, and he says A figure, wrapt in tomb-like vestments, passed Shadowy across the portal, soundless and swift. ANATOLIUS. 'Tis credible on record that great men Have awful warnings—that their souls, sublimed From all mean matter, have held communing With disembodied beings. Brutus met Dead Cæsar at Philippi. SALLUST. If 'tis decreed, The summons is for all—our web of life Is mingled with his thread;—the gloomy sisters Will close their shears on all. Look round, look round, The mountains hem us in one common tomb— We can but choose 'twixt famine and the sword. Enter Julian. NEVITTA. Hail to thy bright sun, my imperial master! It lights us to our labours smilingly. HORMISDAS. 'Tis a good omen: hail, all conquering prince! Shake not thy head—all will be well yet. SALLUST. Flatterer! This is no time, (albeit our eyes are heavy With watching, pain, and long anxiety,) To shut them on the danger: it is broad And imminent. ANATOLIUS. I am content to die For thee, dear sov'reign, and th' old Roman honour, And I rejoice the sun looks out to see us Fall, like the Spartans with Leonidas. JULIAN. When men do feel but small hope to confront The sun-set with their living eyes, methinks Good day would be an idle ceremony. It were an apter salutation To say, even with an aching heart, farewell! Enter Jovian. JOVIAN. Arm, arm, my prince,—around, on every side, The Persian hosts unfold their countless squadrons, From their primeval forests issuing: I think there 's not a Parthian bow unstrung, Or an Assyrian cuirassier unhelmed For this encounter. JULIAN. Well, well, be it so— We shall have gorgeous rites and many mourners. NEVITTA. Nay, think not thus: our soldiers ere to night Shall tear rich booty from the runagates, Bright golden comforters from comely corpses. Hark to the Gothic trumpet! how it starts (Sound of Trumpets. Thick-coming, on the freshening gusts of air. Anon our Gauls wind their deep cornet's breath With a most manly music. JOVIAN. Look, my Lord. There, by yon point of wood, (the dizzy road Emerging round the cliff) half lost in shadows, The stream of living war rolls slowly on. Their bright array makes the pulse bound again, Havock ne'er marched 'neath such a panoply. NEVITTA. Gods, what a gleam of armour! how their crests Toss, and their saucy banners flout the sky. How I do burn to give my horse the rein, And loose my Gallic hounds upon them! JULIAN. Ay, They are a noble quarry, meet companions To sleep to-night with us on clay-cold pillows. Enter Maximus. MAXIMUS. Let those woo death who have in life no hope, And hug the ghastly comforter, Despair! They fear a fall who take too bold a leap— His head grows giddy that is perched too high. The Persian speaks us fair—say, shall we fling Our bodies to the trampling elephant, And call it glory to be trod to death? JULIAN. Old priest, I pray thee step aside and tempt not An angry nature in extremity. Thou tread'st upon a serpent. MAXIMUS. Man-God! who Shall chide but the infallible? Art thou So sinless, so omnipotent? Who led Rome's armies to these Caudine forks? Earth yawns: Thou should'st leap in, like Curtius, alone. Where is our hope? If ye join battle now, So shall ye never see your native land, Beside the sunny banks of Hellespont! If ye submit, (I speak advisedly, With undefiled honour, sound discretion,) So shall ye clasp your longing wives again And dance light-laughing babes on welcome knees. JULIAN. Away, I 'll hear no more. MAXIMUS. There have been men Have seen strange prodigies—the sky last night Was flushed with meteors. I myself beheld— JULIAN. Thou paltering priest, I do reject the omen. Coward! thou dost betray us: cease, or mark me, I 'll hang thee on that blasted tree, thou raven! Go—grovel, slave, before thy recreant Gods, I supplicate from them no hopeless succour. The arrow-flight shall be our lightning's flash, The hoofs of charging squadrons rattling thunder, And, for Jove's eagles, we'll have Roman standards Hovering above the foaming surge of battle, To fright the wild eye of pale-visaged war. MAXIMUS. Good—but when thronging javelins bear thee down, And hunt thee like the lion to the toils, How shalt thou 'scape the doom? There is no way. JULIAN. Byzantine! dost not know our Roman way? When Brutus saw his legions at Philippi Broken, he fell upon his sword and died. Cato survived not freedom. Antony Set free his prisoned soul and laughed at bondage. (Shouts within—blast of trumpets. JOVIAN. Hark! th' advanced guards meet. These are their trumpets. JULIAN. Who leads the Persian host to-day? NEVITTA. I saw The trappings of the royal elephant Gleam in the sun-set yesterday—he rode So close upon our rear, we startled him With a salute of arrows. JULIAN. Gallant companions, This is no time for words: our deeds to-day Shall speak our eulogy or epitaph. I need not counsel Romans to be brave, Or lecture veterans on points of duty; Remember all you fight for—think of those You shall re-visit soon, in shame or glory; Or, dying, leave the hero's heritage— Undying reputation. Choose, and nobly, Chains or the arch of triumph—death or slavery! (The cry of onset heard. Away, away!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Field of Battle. The Romans fly across the field. Enter Anatolius, wounded. ANATOLIUS. Leave me, soldiers—leave me to die: my sands Ebb quickly, and my sluggard pulse beats faint. Leave me to die. (He falls) To die! nay, stand not round me, You keep my flitting soul in bondage—fly To some more hopeful rescue. (They leave him. Treachery! Oh, treachery, treachery! villainous treachery! (Enter Maximus, leading a band of Persians, with Meranes.) ANATOLIUS. Behold the spotted viper! Maximus—ho! Traitor! MAXIMUS. Who calls me with that voice of death And contumelious taunting? Anatolius! Ha, art thou scotched, thou snake? I toss thee back Th' injurious epithet! Thou smil'dst to-day, When Julian chid me in the midst of you— It glutteth me to see thee dying. ANATOLIUS. Stay! Yet ere I die. Oh, fate, a little strength! And hear me curse thee—curse thee, Maximus! (Dies. (Enter Julian, chasing the Persians. Seizes Maximus and flings him down. JULIAN. (Lifting his sword and treading him down. Thou complicated traitor! have I caught thee? What! in the very crime, reeking with guilt, All leprous in thy pestilent infamy? Ha, hell-hound! not a word? MAXIMUS. Spare me, spare me! JULIAN. Blood-sucking parricide! with hands just dipped In thy sold country's slaughter, nam'st thou mercy? Thou Judas! purchased with the dross of earth! Ay, twine thy trembling fingers round my blade And pray to me with thy convulsed lips— Stare with distended eye on certain death— Writhe in thy pangs, they are my consolation. By all the ghastly spectres of past crimes! By all the broken hearts thou 'st made! By all The dark mementos of this bosom, standing, Demons of wrath, around us! I devote One sacrifice to vengeance ere I die, One victim more to direful Nemesis. Bear witness Heaven and Hell—I dedicate (Nay, look upon me, wretch, before I kill thee) Thy reeking blood to the infernal Gods. There—let me look on thee, poor dog! now die. (Stabs him. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Persian Camp. Sapor. Meranes, Nohordates, Generals of his Army. Officers, Satraps, &amp;c. SAPOR. Hath Julian 'scaped? Nay, then this sea of slaughter Is a vain deluge. Dastards! I had set My heart on caging this vile Roman braggart, Like a wild panther. I would have shewn the world How wild beasts may be tamed. Curse on ye, Dastards! Did I not command All sacrifice, all lavish waste of life, Dead or alive to take him? MERANES. Gracious Sov'reign, Deeds have been done this day that put to shame The Greek romance of Hercules NOHORDATES. Eyes ne'er saw So deathful an encounter as ensued When the Immortals charged: one spirit seemed In horse and man—they swept the dusty plain Like the prodigious Centaurs. In the midst These eyes saw Julian fall. SAPOR. Where is his head? If ye have killed him, where is his head? I tell ye I would have had it stuffed with precious spices And stuck upon a pole within my chamber, And solaced me with daily contemplation— Ay, laughed to see death incorruptible! Thus would I make mine enemy immortal! (A wounded Officer brought in. OFFICER. Great Lord of Earth! here 's one who hath escaped I' th' heat of battle, from the enemy's ranks; His tale may chance direct us. SAPOR. What is he? OFFICER. A leader of a gallant band, surprised Last night by th' enemy, ambushed near their camp: His wounds attest good service. SAPOR. Speak and quickly, Of Julian—speak! WOUNDED OFFICER. I saw the great Apostate Gallantly bearing up his fallen fortune Through half the day. SAPOR. Speak to the purpose, ideot! WOUNDED OFFICER. I stood beneath a rock, a jutting rock, That screened the plain on which his vanguard formed; Thither he came, and that proud woman with him, The Macedonian Queen, Eusebia, Armed like Bellona. He was calm and solemn: She too was pale—her white lips were compressed; While her quick eyes glanced round, 'neath lowering brows, Half vengeance, half despair. Just then they parted, He sprang upon his horse. NOHORDATES. I marked the despot— Even like an arrow on the wind, he rode His winged courser, and with noble daring Swept with his chivalrous escort past our front, Even at the stormy edge of chasing battle. Our arrows touched him not, his life was charmed! Sudden he reined his horse up, raised his helmet, And shouting thrice aloud, waved his bare hand. A chosen troop rushed forward—then he turned His charger round, and in short circle wheeling, With a loud cry triumphantly rushed on us. MERANES. He seemed a super-human presence, fraught With an unearthly valour, demon phrensy! A fiend was surely in his heart and arm; Satanic majesty was in his eye. The war-mist rolling round him; his keen sword Flashed like hot lightning, bright and terrible— He seemed as moving in a thunder-cloud. NOHORDATES. And that black horse—an hellish birth was he too. I saw his gaping nostrils red with fire, A foam of gore he tossed from his dark jaws, In his reverted eyes blazed swarthy flames. His proud hoofs, as they pawed the air and struck Sparks from the spurned earth, seemed shod in Hell With penal steel. MERANES. 'Twas so—and his sad bearing, When some good sword struck his crowned helmet off, Did well become that thought. His teeth were clenched, His cheeks were bloodless, and his hollow eyes Dark with accumulated agony. Yet were his features passionless—a calm And terrible despair, a marble stillness, (As if some inward fire had charred his heart,) Looked out from him immoveable. Most awful! Dread contrast with the tempest of that hour! SAPOR. Why, this is well—though somewhat more of praise Haply than he deserves. Yet does his fame Augment our glory: know ye no more? OFFICER. I saw him Headlong on earth, rolled from his dying horse, That foundered o'er a heap of carcases. He fell: just then a trooper suddenly Reared his stout horse, half turned, and, backward leaning, Thrust down his lance and pinned him to the ground. I saw him rise against the mortal steel And wrench it in the wound, like a spent tiger; Then, heaving on his knee, with backward stroke Hamstring the horse: that with a plunge, fell prone. Stunned by the fall, his rider lay all senseless; When Julian freed plucked forth the shaft and leaped Upon his breast and stabbed him. Some few friends Rushed to the rescue and I saw no more: Yet do I think that javelin's point was edged With fate, and full of death. SAPOR. There 's gold for thee, Thy tidings are the best. Now, forward—forward, Storm their proud camp: I will not leave a Roman To tell the tale. MERANES. Pause, conqueror of kings, The troops are faint with carnage. Havoc has left Strange chasms in our battalia. SAPOR. Slave! I ask not The Gods to spare men's lives: 'tis victory That I command. Forward, I say. (Exeunt.</field>

The spirit that deemed half the world too small, Torn from its lordly habitation, Crushed in its vigour, hurled from its high throne, Cast naked on eternity—to stand With common souls before the Judgment-seat! (A distant shout heard, Julian starting on his feet. Where am I? Bind me on my horse! to arms! Slaves! shall I die upon a couch? A myriad Of agonising thoughts throng in my brain. Oh, for a bloody bank, a broken sword, And banners drooping over me! Oh, vengeance, Some vengeance yet! To horse! I say—upon them! I tell ye I am strong. A lightning rushes Through my hot veins would swell a thousand pulses. (Sinks down exhausted. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Look on these traitor limbs; Oh, hear this braggard voice! Nevitta, thou Hast seen this clod of earth true to its spirit? I 've not been a vain boaster always? NEVITTA. Emperor, I 've swam the gulphy Rhine with thee at midnight, Beneath a canopy of fiery darts: I 've plunged with thee into the tide of men When every living wave was swoln with fate; Yet never shrank before—'tis terrible. (Julian leans forward with a fixed look. JULIAN. How many of ye stand around me? late I saw but three. EUSEBIA. There are no more: Nevitta Hormisdas, and myself. JULIAN. There is a fourth, Look—don't you see him? shadowy—look—there, there— He comes to me. Thou supernatural shape! Vast, gloomy, silent, undefinable! I saw thee at Eleusis. Thou didst look Last night upon my troubled sleep: I heard Thy rustling folds departing. Still and dark Is the dread meaning of thine awful eye! Art thou the Spirit of Judgment, that doth write Man's doom upon the adamantine book? Or, with thy basilisk presence dost thou come, Wrath-executing Minister! to watch Lost souls just flitting from the gates of life? Speak to me—speak to me! (He sinks back in a stupor. NEVITTA. His senses wander. It is most awful. Saw you aught, my Lord? HORMISDAS. No, nothing: yet methinks a rustling passed us, A swift division of the air—a sound, As of departing wings. JULIAN. (recovering. Eusebia! Thou art the last tie that I have on earth: I would look on thee once again—thy features Remind me of past happiness:—no matter; I fashioned my own fortunes. Turn me—so. Turn me upon my side: 'tis well; I'm easier. The blood flows freely now; my pains are deadened: Come near. I'm somewhat numbed, and heavy, heavy— Cold, very cold, and dark, Eusebia! Give me some air—breath, breath—some air, some air. Bear me—where I—can see—the sun: (They bring Julian forward: he fixes his eye upward. “Oh, Galilean!

      <field name="fulltext">NOTE. One or two passages in one of the earliest of the foregoing Scenes, are derived from my recollection of an old tract written with an atrocious power of language. To the matter of this writer I involuntarily fashioned the savage principles I had to ascribe to Maximus. I am not aware of having in any other part of my Poem adopted the ideas of any other writer. I have certainly had no model present to my imagination: and have only from a distance, and with reverence, regarded those admirable writers who were the founders, and remain the glory, of our dramatic literature. In my general sketch only have I sought to adhere to history. I have varied from it in many details. For instance, the mode of attack by which Maojamalcha was reduced, I have applied to Perisabor; principally, I believe, because the former name is not of easy pronunciation.</field>
