      <field name="fulltext">THE DOUBTFUL HEIR. A Tragi-comedie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the most worthily honored Sir Edmund Bowier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. All that the Prologue comes for, is to say, Our Author did not calculate this Play For this Meridian; the Banckside, he knows, Are far more skilfull at the Ebbes and flows Of water, than of wit, he did not mean For the elevation of your poles, this scene. No shews, no dance, and what you most delight in, Grave understanders, here's no target fighting Upon the Stage, all work for Cutlers barr'd, No bawdery, nor no Ballets; this goes hard; But language clean, and what affects you not, Without impossibilities the Plot; No clown, no squibs, no Devill in't; oh now You Squirrels that want Nuts, what will you do? Pray do not crack the benches; and we may Hereafter fit your Palats with a Play: But you that can contract your selves, and sit As you were now in the Black-Fryers pit; And will not deaf us, with leud noise and tongues, Because we have no Heart to break our Lungs, Will pardon our vast Stage, and not disgrace This Play, meant for your persons, not the place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons of the Play. Leonario, Prince of Arragon. Ferdinand, King of Murcia. Rodriguez, Nobleman. Ernesto, Nobleman. Leandro, Nobleman. Alfonso, Father to Rosania. Olivia, supposed Queen of Murcia. Rosania, Alfonso's, Daughter. Violinda. Captain. Citizens. Courtier. Officers. Souldiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Murcia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. Enter Rodriguez and Ernesto. Rod. This turn was not expected, Prince Leonario Is much perplext. Ern. I cannot blame his Highness, So neer an expectation of a blessing, To be thus crost. Rod. The Day of Marriage set, With the applausive Vote of both the Kingdoms, By an unlookt for War to be put of, Would vex a royall spleen. Er. 'Tis but deferr'd. Rod. I doe not like the hope on't. Er. I pittie The Princely lover, worthy (without blemish To the excelling virtues of the Queen) Of as much goodness as her sex contains, So Noble in his Nature, Active, bountifull Discreet, and valiant, if we may believe What his young fame profers to every knowledge. Rod. This character is not flattery, and yet The Queen our Mistriss is not lost in this Just praise of him. Er. I have no thought so Impious, My dutie never taught me to commend But to obey, her Virgin sweetness makes me Her just admirer but when I observe Her prudent manage of the State, a strength Would become many years, her pious Laws, But that without example, made to advance Her sexes Chastitie, I forget all Beside worth praise, though every least of her Desert would ask a volume. 'Tis his Excellence. Enter Leonario, Captain. Rod. Ther's one not sorry for these Wars. Er. 'Tis his Profession; Souldiers batten in a Tempest. Rod. And he deserves employment; yet I think Hee'l never purchase with his pay. Leo. Be confident; Your worth will plead alone; the Queen expects me. Ex. Leon. Capt. Your Highness humble creature;âso, ther's hope yet After a time of ease, and surfet, we May cure our selves by letting others Bloud. My Noble Lords. Ernest. 'Morrow Captain, you look blith, and bright. Capt. I'l put my Sword to scowring that shall shine. I thank Heaven my prayers are heard. Rod. What prayers? Cap. That honest men may cut knaves throats, and bid Defiance to the Hangman; Musk, and Civet Have too long stifled us, ther's no recovery Without the smell of Gunpowder. Enter two Citizens. Er. But Captainâ 1 C. 'Tis he, we must not lose him, 2 C. He has credit with the Lords it seems. 1 C. He has spied us. Capt. My honest friends, welcome to Court. My Lords Pray grace these honest Gentlemen, they will Deserve to kiss your Hands. 1 C. Our business Is to you Captain. Capt. Doe you think what these brace of Baboons come for? Rod. Not I. Capt. By this day for mony, moneys that I owe 'em. Er. Is't possible? Capt. I ha' mov'd your sute Gentlemen. 1 C. What sute? Capt. Touching the Masque. Which you two in the name Of the whole City, offer'd to present At the Town charges to congratulate The Queens intended Marriage; I know This Egge was long a hatching, and expected, But that your Heads could not agree, they being Of severall sizes, some upon the shoulders Of your long-winded Officers, whose purse Was made of the Leather with their conscience. 1 Ci. Does he talk to us of a Masque? 2 Ci. Good Captain put your Masque off, and give us. The money that you owe us. Capt. Was't not meant nobly? But you my good Lords know how much The Queen and Prince are sorry, that so rare A President of their duty should not be Upon record; this villanous War distracts All civill mirth, but you will be remembred. 1 Ci. We know not what you mean, we have no anticks In agitation; if your Captain-ship Will pay your debts so; there is Law and courses To be taken, and you will find that Justice Can deal Sir with the Sword as well as Ballance. Capt. The Puppys talk Philosophy; nay then I must be plain, would I could tice 'em to A little treason, theyl ne'r hang for felony. Why, whither doe you think I am going now? 1 Cit. We care not whither; so you pay us first. Capt. Let their own Fathers swing, so they have mony. 2 Cit. May be you are going to the Wars. Capt. Yes Mongrels, To fight for your chamlet Faces, while you stay at home And catch the cramp with telling mony, Putting your Guts to Pension every Day, And roots, untill the wind cry out agen you, And with your belching backwards stifle Men That walk the Street, untill the Air be purg'd; Must we Eat Bullets without Butter, Whelps? Have our Throats cut, or drop like Sheep by'th' hundred, O' the rot, to buy your Peace, you boding Screechowls? And ha' your consciences so course a Nap To aske money of us? 1 Cit. You had the conscience To take up our commodities. Capt. Reason good; Should I goe naked leeches? 2 Cit. No, but there is reason That you should pay good Captain, for your warmth. Capt. Pay you? for what? for Cloaths, such things as these? Your tribe is bound to keep us. 1 Cit. How? Capt. Yes, and desire us to accept your wares, To recompence our sufferings; 'tis we, 'Tis we that keep your Worships warm and living, By Marching, Fasting, Fighting and a thousand Dangers, (you o'r grown moths) you that love gold, And wo'not take an Angell sent from Heaven Unless you weigh him, you that spend the Day In looking o'r your debtâBook, and at Night Can lap and lecher in your Feather Beds, Then snort, and dream of fourscore in the hundred, Afraid of nothing but the Gout, or what Is a more just reward for your hard hearts The stone, which puts you to the charge of Physick To make you piss out your last Usurers Gallon, Or of a Surgeon, to cut you for The Pibles, which (if you survive Incission) You keep in penny Boxes, like deer reliques, And shew your friends, when you intend to visit 'em. And beg a Dinner. Er. Let not passion Make you too much abuse their qulaity; The City does contain brave fellows Captain, As generous, as bountifull, discreet, And valiant too, as any boast themselves In Court or Camp. Cap. I grant you my good Lord, And honour all the Noble souls within it, But these are walking sicknesses, not Citizens; Two such prodigious things with crooked consciences, Though Young, yet Old in Usuryâ 2 Cit. All this Captain Wo'not pay us our money, which we must Have or Petition for to your disgrace. Cap. Well since there is no remedy, will you take These two Noblemens words for what I owe you? 1 Cit. Withall our Hearts. Rod. That bargain is to make. Er. Good Captain, at this time you may excuse us, Capt. Why, doe your Lordships think I'd let you suffer, Come, y'ar my honourable friends; pass, pass Your word, Ile pay the mony; hang 'em dottrels Ile not be beholding to 'em. Rod. We had rather you should good Captain. Capt. No,âcome hither Capons Will money content you; shall I walk the Street Without a Head ake, with your bawling for The debt when I ha' paid you? 2 Cit. 'Tis but reason. Capt. I'l fetch you money presently,âyou may follow If you please, but these Noblemen shall see And witness what I pay you, I'l not trust Your Memorandums. 1 Cit. Withall our Hearts Sir. 2 Cit. We desire no more. Capt. I'l wait on you again. [Ex. Manent Rod. Ernesto. Enter Leandro, reading a Paper. Rod. Fortune de la guerre. My Lord Leandro? what papers that He so intentively peruses? Lean. I like it, and could willingly allow The change; the Queen grows mighty in her spirit, And this match with the Prince, would swell her State Too much; my Lords. Rod. We are yours. Leand. See what dangerous Papers have been scatter'd To wound the Title of our Royall Mistriss; My servant brought me this; our Enemie Who calls himself Prince Ferdinand would fain Have us believe him Cosen to the Queen, She an usurper of his Crown. Er. We all know him dead. Rod. I'm sure I did attend his Funerall. Lean. I think I waited too. Er. This paper sayes he was conveyd away, And so escap'd his Uncles cruelty, To whose protection he was left an Infant; He dying, we translated our obedience To his Daughter, now our Queen. Rod. Here's an Impostor. Leand. Heaven aid the Innocent say I; he has Valentias aid and comes not to Invite But force a resignation; I wish things Were calm agen. Er. Prince Leonario, if she prosper not, Is like to be a loser too. Leand. For him It matters not, we have more to think on now, Than love and complement. Rod. I thought he would be Generall 'Gainst this pretended Ferdinand. Leand. What else? Her sweet Heart, that gives Cupid in his crest. Alas! there needs no art, nor strength of War To advance her cause, Justice will fight for her I'th' Clouds, and victory sent from Heaven, without Her souldiers sweat, will gloriously descend To Crown his Head with Laurell. Er. May it prove so. Leand. I could say things would stagger your belief, But I forgot the Queen sent for me; to You both a servantâ Exit. Er. I do not like my Lord Leandros winding, He has been faithfull. Rod. Alwaies honourable. The Queen. Enter Queen, Leonario, Captain, Leandro, Violinda, Attendants, Ladies, Gentlemen. Leon. I take this as the greatest honour Madam You could confer; my name is young in War, But my affection to your royall person, Arm'd with the virtue of your cause, shall make me Doe something worth your name. Que. 'Twas your request, Nor could we place our chief command, but where 'Tis equald with your Interest in us And your own merit. Leon. Sure my Stars did mean This way to make you know, how much my heart Dares in your service; and if Ferdinand, For so he calls himself, possess a soul Above the vulgar making, we shall spare The Blood of many, and conclude the War In single opposition. Leand. With your Highness pardon, It not becomes you should Engage your Person, And so great a cause so dangerously; It will be too much honor to th'Impostor, And in the supposition of the World, A strength to his pretence, to bring your Birth So low, to humble both your self and fortunes To his unworthy Levell, a thing grown Up in the Night, a Meteor hanging in The Air, prodigiously, fed with vapor, and Black Influence, ambitious to deceive The World, and challenge kindred with the Stars; It is too great a venture Sir. Er. Since there must be a War Let the armies meet in Battail, theres more hope After the worst to reinforce, and prosper, Than when the kingdoms put upon one stake, And one Mans chance to assure it. Que. I allow Your Counsell Lords; but have more argument Convincing me, not to run such a hazard Of what must make Olivia rich hereafter; A kingdoms loss may be repair'd, but your Life made a Sacrifice to tyrant War, May find a welcome to the other shades, But no tears can Invite you back, to share, Or grief, or Joy with me; Ile have no Duell. Leon. 'Tis a command, and my obedience Shall meet it, though I fear 'twill be a sin To be too carefull of my self but I Shall still remember I am your Souldier, And this consider'd shall not make me rash, But wisely teach me to deserve this title Which lives but in your honour. Que. I'l pray for you, And not so much for what concerns the State, As what your merit hath already gain'd Upon my Heart. Rod. Blessings upon 'em both, A curse upon these Wars, that spoil their mirth. Que. My Lord Leandro. Leon. Ther's your Commission Captain, I suppose You have found wayes to empty your Exchequer. Capt. My Baggs are not brimfull my Lord, I have Defalk'd, and made an ebbe for Wine, and Women, And other things that keep poor men alive To doe their country service. Leon. Please you walk With this Gentleman Captain, he shall pay you Five hundred pieces that I owe you. Capt. Me, your Grace owes me nothing, Leon. I could not pay the debt in better time Sir. Capt. Umh! I will take the mony, and allow the miracle. Ex. Capt. &amp; Gent. Er. Did you observe the Princes nobleness? Although the act become him. Yet the manner Takes me especially, Heaven preserve the Captain From being Mad. Leon. I prosper in your Vote, But shall I Madam, if that power, which Crowns With victory, guides me with fair success In this your War, and triumph smile upon us, Shall I at my return have that reward My soul next Heaven affects? shall no delay (Colder than Frost to lovers blood,) afflict My expectation of our Marriage? Although to doubt this be a sin, yet where The ambition is so Just, I shall but right My Heart, to have it oft assur'd, nor can It make your eye less rich in smiles, when 'tis Only my love Encourages me to make The busie harmless question. Que. It does please me, Nor can you ask so often, as I have A cheerfulness to answer, that I love you, And have propounded nothing dearer to me, Than that which perfects chast affection, And chains two Hearts; the Priest with sadness will Expect you safe agen, but from this War When you return, he shall not in his Register Of Lovers, find one, with more wing hath met The bosom of her friend, than glad Olivia To make one soul with you. Leon. I have enough, And thirst for action in the Field, from whence I will bring Harvest home, or leave my self, Happy in life or death to doe you service. Ex. Queen, Leon. Lean. Ladies, attendants. Rod. Well, I'm afraid if Hymen should set up His Tapers now, they would not last to light His Priest, at their return to say his Office. Er. Hope fairly. Rod. I allow his spirit, but The Prince hath not been practis'd in The School of War, where stratagems prevail Above all personall resolution. Er. He cannot want fit counsell to direct His early valour, besides Ferdinand by computation as young as he Enter Captain, two Citizens, and a Souldier. May poize the scale. See, the Captain. 1 Cit. We alwaies thought you Noble, and we hope You'l take no offence, that our occasions Prevail'd above our modestie. Capt.

And will agen; command our Shops. Capt. No, sit there, and starve, Or if you like it better take a swing At your own sign Post. Er. Good words Captain. Capt.

My Lords, bear witness, These two would bribe me to abuse the Queen And the present service, is this less then Treason? Both Cit. Oh. Er. Nay, nay Captain. Capt. There are not two more able Men i'th' Army, I mean for bulk; ram me into a Cannon If you shall buy your selves with your estates From this Imployment; Il not cosen you, Your mony is good debt still, you may live, And aske me for't agen, and I may pay you. Rod. But shall they serve indeed? Capt. That's at their perill When they come to'th' field, but goe they shall, And they were my Cosen-germans. Both Cit. Good my Lord speak for us. Capt. You doe not know my Lords, but a little suffering May save their souls, and teach 'em, if they come Off, with a quarter of their limbs, compassion To other Men, that venter their lives for 'em, Their consciences are tough, and must be suppled, When they shall fast, and march ten months in armor, Sometimes through Rivers, sometimes over Mountains, And not have straw at Night, to keep their Breech From growing to the Earth, in storms, in heats; When they have felt the softness of a trench Thigh deep in water, and their dung to fatten it; When they shall see no meat within a month, But chaw their Match like Liquorish, and digest The Bark of trees like Sallads in the Summer; When they shall live to think theres no such thing In Nature as a thirst, and wonder why A Taylor was created; when they have As much in ready shot, within their flesh, As would set up a Plummer, or repair A Church with Lead, beside ten thousand more Afflictions, which they are sure to find, They may have Christianitie, and not put A Souldier to the payment of his debts. Rod. 'Tis a Mad Captain, come my Lord lets leave him. Ex. Lords. Capt. You shall have time and place to send for mony, Or make your Wils; set on, who knows but you Hereafter may be honest, and prove Captains; You may have preferment in the Wars for money, And so my Gentle Creditors, march on.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Enter Leandro with Letters. Lean. The hope, and care of many years, are in One day destroy'd; hath Heaven no stroke in War? Or is old providence asleep? Leonario Is comming home with victorie, and brings Young Ferdinand, whom I expected to Salute a King, his Prisoner, and the Queen With her new Conqueror, glorious in the spoils, By putting out this light, will mix their beams And burn our eyes out with their shine; there is No talk but of this triumph, and the people Whom I by art and secret murmurs had Made doubtful at the first noise of this Conquest, As they had borrowed souls from fear, and folly, Adore the rising Star, and in the praise Of him and his great fate, wonder that Heaven Should hold a Sun, and he so bright; nor with This flattery content, but they condemn, (As low as all their sins shall one day them) Him whom the chance of War hath made a Prisoner. There is no trust to policie or time, The things of State are whirld by destinie, To meet their period, Art cannot repair 'em. Enter Servant. Ser. My Lord, the Queen hath sent for you, She is going forth to meet the Prince, and hath Commanded none be wanting to attend With all the State that may become her, to Congratulate the triumph now brought home. Leand. I shall obey. I must attend this glorie; It is not safe to wear a brow, but what The Queens example first forms into smile. I here contract my knowledge, and seclude My wishes, since they prosper not. I am Her Chancelor, as great Offices, and high Employments, do expose us to most danger, They oft teach those possess 'em a State-wisdom, And by Inherent virtues of the place, Our fear to lose, makes us secure our selves, By art more often, than by conscience; But I may be indangered to suspition; I like not things; but I delay my attendance. Exit. Enter Captain, Lieutenant, Antient and Souldiers. Capt. Lieutenant. Lieu. Captain. Capt. Antient, what think you of the Wars now? Ant. We are come off with Honour. Lieu. And our Limbs, Captain. Capt. Is that all? who made you a Lieutenant? And you Antient? these titles were not born w'e, You did not wear these Buffs and Feathers in The memorie of Man, when you receiv'd The binding twelve-pence, it was otherwise. Ant. But you receiv'd, if you remember Captain, Beside what we releast in honest debt Sums for this great Instalment, we ha' paid I take it for our names. Capt. And it became you, Now you are Gentlemen, my Comrades of honor, And I dare walk and drink at Taverns w'e, Your oaths become you now, and your splay feet; You look'd before like Magots, City Worms, I ha' made you both brave fellows, fellows to Knights. You may be Squires to Ladies too. Ant. I think so. Capt. We are all now of a trade, For Mars is Master of our Companie, Our Shop is the Field, Resolution our Stock, Honour our Purchase, and Fire and Sword The Tools we work withall. Lieu. But now the Wars are done, I think We may shut up our Shop, there is no more Pay, is there? Capt. Pox upon you; I see your souls bleat after Profit still, a bullet in the right place would Ha' knock'd out this humour of getting mony; But fear not, though you come off with more Limbs than you deserve, you shall have pay. Ant. Shall we, and not be troubled to fight for't? Capt. Yes, it will be necessary you fight, you will Ha' your throats cut else, and be sent off like Sheep, Doe not fear payment here be Mandrakes, That will rore, and cudgell you to your hearts content, You sha'not walk the Streets now you are Officers without a quarrell: pay enough. Lieu. A Man had as good be no Lieutenant, as be Beaten when he comes home what think you Antient? Ant. For my part, I can indure beating as well As another, if that be all. Capt. Will you to your Shops agen? Ant. I have no mind to Woosted Stockings agen, And Shoos that Shine, I would were colours still. Capt. Well said Antient, come I'l take your fears off; Doe not confess you are a Lieutenant, or you an Antient, and no man will quarrell w'ee, you Shall be as secure as Chrysome Children. Lieu. Shall we? they shall rack me e'r Ile confess I am A Lieutenant or ever see the Wars. Ant. Or I an Antient. Ile tak't upon my death I was never a Souldier in my life. Capt. 'Tis well done; now because I love you, And see you have an Itch after honour, so It may come without blows, Let me advise you, You have moneys at command. Lieut. And good debts too. Cap. You shall both turn Courtiers. Ant. Shall we? Cap. I say't; for if my phisnomy deceive me not, You two are born to beâ Both. What? Cap. Coxbombs. I'l help to make you too; You shall presently kiss the Queens hand; You have moneys you say, You shall never turn To your vomit of small Wares. I have friends At Court, you may in time be great; And when I come With a Petition to your honors, for moneys in arrear, Or knocking out some rascals brains, such as you were When you wore a girt under your chops, you two May stand between me and the Gallows. Ant. Hang us if we do not. Capt. You shall buy places presently. But stay, Have you a minde to be Officers to the Queen In ordinary, or extraordinary? Ant. Extraordinary by all means. Lieut. We scorn to be ordinary Courtiers. Capt. I commend your judgement, that will be more Chargeable: Butâ Ant. Hang't, we'l finde money enough, but I Resolve to be extraordinary. Capt. I'l bring you to a Court-Merchant presently; You will get infinite estates. Both. A ha Captain. Capt. And so command the Ladies, if you be bountiful. Both. A ha Boy. Capt. For I know you do love Wenches; You will have all the business, and the Country Come tumbling in upon you like the tide, After a moneth: You must keep twenty men Between you, night and day to tell your money. Oh 'tis unknown what will become on you, If you be rul'd, and take this course: Had I Moneys like you, I would beâ Lieut. Come, we will lend thee moneys too hereafter. Cap. Will you, come on, no more Lieutenant now. Nor Antient. Ant. Do ye think we long to be beaten. Exeunt. Enter Ferdinand (in prison) Rosania (like a Page.) Rosa. Pray do not grieve for me, I have a heart That can for your sake suffer more; and when The tyranny of your fate calls me to die, I can as willingly resign my breath, As go to sleep. Ferd. Can I hear this Rosania Without a fresh wound? That thy love to me Should be so ill rewarded, th'ast engag'd Thy self too much already; 'tis within Thy will, yet to be safe, reveal thy self, Throw of the cloud that doth eclipse that brightness, And they will court thy person, and be proud With all becoming-honor to receive thee, No fear shall rob thy cheek of her chaste blood. Oh leave me to my own Stars, and expect What ere become of wretched Ferdinand, A happy fate. Rosa. Your Councel is unkinde, This language would become your charity To a stranger, but my Interest is more In thee, then thus with words to be sent off; Our vows have made us one, nor can the names Of Father, Countrey, or what can be dear In Nature, bribe one thought to wish my self In Heaven without thy company; it were poor then To leave thee here. Then by thy faith I charge thee, By thisâthe first and last seal of our love. Kisses him. By all our promises, when we did flatter Our selves, and in our fancy took the world A peeces, and collected what did like Us best, to make us a new paradice, By that, the noblest ornament of thy soul, Thy honor, I conjure thee, let me still Be undiscovered; What will it avail To leave me, whom thou lovest, and walk alone Sad pilgrime to another world? We will Converse in soul, and shoot like Stars, whose Beams Are twisted, and make bright the sullen Groves Of Lovers as we pass. Ferd. These are but dreams Of happiness, be wise Rosania, Thy love is not a friend to make thee miserable, Society in death, where we affect, But multiplies our grief; Live thou, Oh live. And if thou hast a tear, when I am dead, But drop it to my memory, it shall More precious then embalming dwell upon me, And keep my ashes pure, my spirit shall At the same instant in some innocent shape Descend upon that earth thou hast bedew'd; And kissing the bright tribute of thy eye, Shall after wait like thy good Angel on thee. There will be none to speak of Ferdinand Without disdain, if thou diest too: Oh live A little to defend me, or at least To say I was no Traitor to thy love, And lay the shame on death and my false Stars That would not let me live to be a King. Rosa. Oh Ferdinand, Thou dost not love me now. Ferd. Not love Rosania? If woing thee to live, will not assure thee, Command me then to die, and spare the cruelty Of the fair Queen: Not love Rosania? If thou wilt but delight to see me bleed, I will at such a narrow passage let Out life, it shall be many hours in ebbing, And my soul bathing in the Crimson stream, Take pleasure to be drown'd. I have small time To love, and be alive, but I will carry So true a Faith to woman hence, as shall Make poor the world, when I am gone to tell The story yonder.âWe are interrupted. Enter Keeper. Keep. You must prepare your self for present trial; I have command to attend you to the Judges. That Gentleman, and all that did adhere To your Conspiracy, are by the Queens Most gracious Mercy pardon'd. Ferd. In that word Th'hast brought me more then life; I shall betray, And with my too much joy undo thee again. Heaven does command thee live, I must obey This Summons, I shall see thee again Tiberio, Before I die. Rosa. I'l wait upon you Sir, The Queen will not deny me that poor office; I know not how to leave you. Ferd. Death and I Shall meet, and be made friends; but when we part, The world shall finde thy story in my heart. Exit. Enter Officers with Bar, Table, Stools,âthen Ernesto, Rodriguez, Leandro, Queen, supported by Leonario, Ferdinand, Rosania, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Guard, who set Ferdinand to the Bar. Queen. Is that the prisoner at the Bar? Leon. He that pretended himself Ferdinand, Your Uncles son. Q. Proceed to his Arraignment; my Lord Leandro, You know our pleasure. Lean. Although the Queen in her own Royal power. And without violating Sacred Justice, where Treason comes to invade her, and her Crown With open war, need not insist upon The Forms, and Circumstance of Law, but use Her Sword in present execution; Yet such is the sweet temper of her blood, And calmness of her Nature, though provok'd Into a storm, unto the great'st offender She shuts up no defence, willing to give A satisfaction to the world how much She doth delight in mercy. Ferdinand, For so thou dost pretend thy self, thou art Indicted of High Treason to Her Majestie, In that thou hast usurp'd relation to Her blood; and under name of being her Kinsman, Not onely hast contriv'd to blast her Honor With Neighbor Princes, but hast gather'd arms To wound the precious bosom of her Countrey, And tear the Crown, which Heaven and just Succession Hath plac'd upon her Royal Head: what canst Thou answer to this Treason? Ferd. Boldly thus. As I was never with the height of all My expectation, and the aid of Friends, Transported one degree above my self, So must not Ferdinand, though his Stars have frown'd And the great eye of Providence seem to slumber While your force thus compel'd, &amp; brought me hither With mockery of my Fate, to be arraign'd For being a Prince; have any thought beneath The Title I was born to; yet I'l not call This cruelty in you, nor in the Queen, (If I may name her so, without injustice To my own right) a Kingdom is a Garland, Worth all Contention; and where right seals not The true Possession, Nature is forgotten, And blood thought cheap to assure it; there is something Within that excellent Figure, that restrains A Passion here, that else would forth like lightning. Tis not your shape, which yet hath so much sweetness, Some pale religious Hermit might suspect You are the blessed Saint he pray'd too; no, The magick's in our nature, and our blood; For both our veins full of one precious purple Strike harmony in their motion, I am Ferdinand, And you the fair Olivia, brothers children. Leon. What insolence is this? Qu. Oh my Lord let him Be free to plead; for it be no dream, His cause will want an Orator: By my blood, He does talk bravely. Rodri. These are flourishes. Ernest. Speak to the treason you are charged with, And confess a guilt. Leond. He justifies himself. Ferd. If it be treason to be born a Prince, To have my Fathers Royal Blood move here; If it be treason, in my infancy To have escap'd by Divine Providence, When my poor life should have been sacrific'd To please a cruel Uncle, whose Ambition Surpris'd my Crown, and after made Olivia His Daughter Queen; if it be treason, to Have been a stranger thus long from my Country, Bred up with silence, of my name, and birth, And not till now mature to own my self Before a Sun-beam; if it be treason After so long a banishment to weep A tear of joy upon my Countries bosom, And call her mine my just inheritance, Unless you stain my blood with bastardy; If it be treason, still to love this Earth, That knew so many of my race, her Kings, Though late unkindly arm'd to kill her Sovereign, As if the effusion of my blood were left To make her fertile, if to love Olivia, My nearest pledge of blood, although her power Hath chain'd her Prince, and made her Lord her prisoner, Who sits with expectation to hear That sentence that must make the golden Wreath, Secure upon her Brow, by blasting mine. If this be treason, I am guilty Ferdinand. Your King's become a traitor, and must die A black, and most inglorious death. Ernest. You offer At some defence, but come not home; by what Engine were you translated hence, or whether Convei'd? There was some trust, deceiv'd, when you Were carried forth to be preserv'd, and much Care taken since, in bringing of you up, And giving secret Fire to this Ambition. Ferd. There wants no testimony here, of what Concerns the story of my Birth and Infancy, If one dare speak, and be an honest Lord. Leand. Hows that? Ferd. Whose love and art secur'd me from all tyranny, Though here my funeral was believ'd, while I Sent to an honorable Friend, his Kinsman, Grew safely to the knowledge of my self At last, till fortune of the War betray'd me To this captivity. Leand. I blush at thee Yong-man, whose fate hath made thee desperate, And car'st not what mans blood thou draw'st along In thy black stream, or what mans faith thou mak'st As hateful as thy crimes. Ernest. That confederate Sure has some name, declare him, that he may Thank you for his reward, and lose his head for't. Quee. We always see that men in such high nature Deform'd, and guilty, want not specious shapes To gain their practice friendship, and compassion, But he shall feel the punishment; d'you smile? Ferd. A womans anger is but worth it Madam; And if I may have freedom, I must say, Not in contempt of what you seem, nor help'd By overcharge of passion, which but makes A fruitless noise; I have a sense of what I am to lose, a life, but I am so fortified With valiant thoughts, and innocence, I shall, When my last breath is giving up to lose Its self i'th' air, be so remote from fear, That I will cast my face into one smile, Which shall when I am dead, acquit all trembling, And be a story to the world, how free From paleness Ferdinand took leave of earth. Rosa. Alas my Lord, you forget me, that can Part with such courage. Ferd. I forget indeed, I thought of death with honor, but my love Hath found a way to chide me; O my Boy, I can weep now. Leon. A sudden change, he weeps. Quee. What Boy is that? Ferd. I prethee take thy self away. Quee. Your Spirit Does melt it seems, and you begin to think A life is worth preserving, though with Infamy. Ferd. Goodness thy aid again, and tell this great Proud woman, I have a Spirit scorns her pity. Come hither Boy, and let me kiss thee; thus At parting with a good, and pretty servant, I can without my honor stain'd shed tears: I took thee from thy Friends, to make thee mine; Is it not truth Boy. Rosa. Yes my Lord. Ferd. And mean't when I was King to make thee great, And shall I not, when I can live no longer, To cherish thee at farewel, drop a tear? That I could weep my soul upon thee,âBut You are to slow me thinks, I am so far From dread, I think your forms too tedious. I expect my sentence. Quee. Let it stay a while. What secret flame is this? Honor protect me! Your Graces fair excuse, for youâI shall Return againâ Exit. Ferd. And I, with better guard After my silence in the Grave, to meet And plead this cause. Ernest. He is distracted sure; His person I could pity, but his insolence Wants an example; what if we proceed To sentence? Leon. I suppose the Queen will clear Your duties in't. Leand. But I'l acquaint her. Exit. Rod. My Lord Leandro's gone. Ernest. His censure will Be one with ours. Ferd. Yet shall I publish who Thou art? I shall not die with a calm soul And leave thee in this cloud. Enter the Queen and Leandro. Rosa. By no means Sir.âThe Queen. Quee. Whose service is so forward to our State, That when Our pleasure's known, not to proceed, They dare be officious in his Sentence? Are We Queen, or do we move by your Protection? Ernest. Madam, the Princeâ Quee. My Lord, you have a Queen. I not suspect his wisdom Sir, but he Hath no Commission here to be a Judge, You were best circumscribe our Regal power, And by your selves condemn, or pardon all, And we sign to your will: The offence, which you Call treason strikes at us, and we release it, Let me but see one curl in any Brow: Attend the prisoner hither;âKiss our hand. Are you so merciless to think this man Fit for a Scaffold. You shall Sir be near us, And if in this confusion of your Fortunes You can finde gratitude, and love, despair not. These men that now oppose, may finde your title Clear to the Kingdom too: Be Sir collected, And let us use your arm. Exit. Supported by Ferdinand. Rosa. What change is here? Leand. What think you of this Lords? Rodri. I dare not think. Leon. Affronted thus? O my vext heart. Exit. Rosa. Ile follow still, and if this be no dream, We have scap'd a Brook, to meet a greater stream. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. Enter Rodriguez, Ernesto. Ernest. Though I believ'd her passionate, and like A Sea, tempestuous in her anger, I Never thought she would marry him. Rodri. She's the Queen, But with what honor she could quit the Prince, Who (without treason) did deserve her too, Comes not within my reach. Ernest. If you consider He has been valiant for her to great purpose, And brought a prisoner home, to mount his Gennet: It was a pretty service. Rod. How does he bear it. Ernest. He's here you may enquire it. Enter Leonario (with Letters) and a Servant. Leon. Be swift and faithful, Arragon bleeds here, Nothing but War can right my cause and honor. Serv. Expect an army great as your own thoughts To cut the way to your revenge. Exit. Leon. My Lords Rodriguez and Ernesto. Ambo. Your Graces servants. Leon. A man may take the benefit of this Garden, Without a Court offence, you have had the day Of triumph, and the Queen already teeming, To bless the Kingdom with an Heir; and yet You see I walk like a poor Neighbor Prince, And have my heart still. Rod. I am glad you bear it so. Leon. Nor have I a meaning To run my self into despair, or strangle My better hopes, out of pure melancholy, I praise the influence of my Stars; there is A fire in Cupids Quiver, that will scorch Through armor; and what's womans flesh and blood To make resistance, though I did not dance Upon the marriage night, I wish'd her joyes I'th' morning. Ernest. Her heart shew'd she was pleas'd With what she had done; she was as active as The air before she went to Bed. Rod. But I Observ'd a declination in the King, And as the night approach'd which should have more Inlarg'd his mirth, he grew more melancholy. Leon. Strange! And such a Bride that took him from So great a loss, to place him in her bosom; But he was mark'd for the Queens thoughts, and I By destiny to bring this pair of Pidgeons Together. I expect no more reward, The Willow Garland Crowns me, but the Prince Is here still. Ernest. Your highness hath a noble temper. Rod. How ere he seem to cover it, his soul Hath a deep apprehension of the affront. Let's leave him, our discourse may be displeasing. We are servants to your Grace. Exeunt Lords. Leon. Y'have honor'd me. Think I am tame still? let the inconstant Queen Secure her thoughts, and glory in my silence; This heart is laboring a revenge. Enter Captain. Captain, what news? the Court is merry still? Cap. Not altogether so merry as it was hop'd for. Leon. Can there be an eclipse already? Cap. I have not read the Almanack for this year, But by my Court Astronomie, I finde Our Sun and Moon are in no Conjunction; They take their fit by turns, the King was cold And full of flegm last night, and they that wait Neer both, report the Queen this morning look'd As she had wept. Leon. O, tears of joy. Cap. Of anger rather, if you saw her sullenness. She frowns on every man, she turn'd away One of her servants but this morning for Presenting her with Verses, that did praise The King, and wish her fruitful. Her own Page Was whipt for saying the King lay with the Queen And might for ought he knew, get her with childe ere morning. Leon. Thou art humorous. Cap. And so are they. Leon. This begins well; and what Do people talk abroad of me, and my Affront? Cap. Why, they say they are sorry for you, Especially the women. Leon. Thou art pleasant. Cap. Some that are cheif in counsel, privately Suspect it but a trick of State; and that You had discover'd underhand the Queen Was notâ Leon.

Look, your friend will shew you a president' He is acquainted with the Court latitude. 1. Cit. This is no striking. Lieut. I know it is not. Cap. They are subtle knaves, and know the Law. Lieut. A pox upon 'em, I feel it. Ant. At their peril say I, these poor things Do not believe that we are extraordinary men, I shall know you another time, I shall. Cap. If you had known him now it had been better For your hanches. Well, I ha' not done with These whelps yet, till they are undone. I shall never be sufficiently revenged for their affront At Court. The Prince commanded me to Expect his return here, I'l not leave Enter Rosania. The Garden. Who's this? Rosa. Is perjury no sin? or can Heaven be So busie or a sleep? Such crimes of men Pass with impunity? Let this wake your anger: This; Ferdinand is married, all his vows Scatter'd in th'air, dispers'd like witherd leaves, And hurried on the wings of some rude Wind, Whose pride was to deflour the Spring; Oh Ferdinand, Couldst thou, whilst yet thy breath was warm with love, With love of me, call back thy faith, and tear Thy Heart from mine to plant it in her Bosom? Capt. How's this? Rosa. What though she be a Queen? could any thirst Of present title flatter thy Soul from me? I that left all for thee, and would have calld Death for thy cause a triumph, now must live The scorn of my own thoughts, despis'd by thee. Capt. Here's a new business; this obscures me quaintly. Enter Leandro. Lean. The King commands you not to leave the Garden. He espied you from the Gallerie Window, and Would have you here attend him. Rosa. Sir, may I Without offence, ask if the King be merry? Leand. We are scarce yet acquainted with his nature, But we observe no Jubilie in his eyes, Nor is the Queen so pleasant as our hopes Did promise after Marriage. Rosa. Pray excuse this boldness. Leand. You'l expect his pleasure here? Exit. Rosa. 'Tis my ambition once more to see, And speak with him, and if his language break not Enter Queen, Leandro. My Heart, I'l take my leaveâthe Queen. Leand. He is a Servant to whom the King Was pleas'd to shew affection, when he had No expectation of your Royall favour. Que. I do remember, I observ'd him once Use more than common passion to this servant, And if we may build any confidence Upon a fair aspect, he may deserve it. Say we would speak with him; my Heart's opprest With melancholy, something tels my spirit I am too tame; have I advanc'd a thing Without a name to perch on the same Cloud With me, and for his sake slighted a Prince, My Honour, and his Faith, transported with My folly and his charms of tongue and person? And dares he pay me with neglect and coldness? Oh my vext soul! but he shall find I have A sense of my dishonour; and yet open Wayes become triviall and poor revengers, I will doe something that shall sting him to Repentance; my Lord you now may leave us. Ex. Leandro. Sir of what Country are you? Rosa. Of Valentia. Que. Your name? Rosa. Tiberio. My Parents not ignoble, yet too hasty I'th' apprehension of Prince Ferdinand; His Fortune (if I may yet call him so) Gave me to be his page, I must confess My diligence thriv'd so well since I came to him, That he did value me above his servant. Que. Yet I've not seen you wait since we were married. Rosa. It was no want of dutie Madam, I Had late some wrastling with a Feaver, that Compeld me to my Chamber, and disabled me For fit attendance. Que. Why dost weep? Rosa. I Madam? Que. I see the tears. Rosa. They are not sorrow then to see my Master Possest of so much happiness in your love, And I am confident, his soul so full Of Honour and regard to your great virtues Will seal him worth your gracious favours Madam, And the worlds Envie. Que. I'l not blame him now For loving thee; and so much hath thy faith And innocence prevail'd, thou sha't translate Thy service, and be mine, he shall consent. Ros. I am to both most humble. Que. Prethee tell me, Making so much of thee, he do's impart Sometimes the secrets of his bosom to thee. Tell me what fault he has, for thou know'st all. Rosa. 'Las Madam I know none, Or if I did, it ill became the trust And dutie of a servant to reveal 'em Que. Thou wer't his bed-fellow? Ros. Gracious Madamâ Que. Do's he not wanton in the night, and talk Of Mistresses. Ros. By truth not to me Madam. Que. Dissemble not I know he has a Mistress. Rosa. If love were ever so unkind to himâ Que. Unkind? why I'st a sin to love? I shall Suspect thy Youth has not been free, thy looks Betray some seeds of Love. Rosa. By all that's good I never was in love but with my Master. Capt. Good. Que. He is not worth it. Rosa. Madam. Que. Be wise, and govern well thy hopes. I'l help Thee to a Mistress; th'ast no Mistress yet? Rosa. But you self Madam. Que. It shall be no other. Thy Master is ingratefull. Ros. Goodness aid him. Que. And wisdom thee, thou art a pretty youth, I will reward thee better, if thou canst Be faithfull and obey. Rosa. In all things Madam That shall become your creature. Que. 'Tis not safe To play with a Queens favours, you shall wait Neer us, forget thy Master, and be happy. Exit. Ros. What clue can guide me in this Labyrinth? I would when I had lost Ferdinands Heart I had lost my understanding. She returns. Enter Queen. Que. The King is comming this way; now be free, Thou sha't have reason afterwards to bless Thy fate, this cannot chose but vex him. The Queen is pleasant with Ros. Enter Ferdinand. Fer. The Queen so pleasant? she has lost her sullenness, Playes with his Hair, and smiles. Ros. Madam, the King Observes us. Ferd. Stroaks his cheek too, she does want A Ganimede; my poor Rosania Art thou the path she walks on to revenge, All is not well within her Heart, but mine Sinks with the heavy pressureâshe is gone. Exit Queen. The Queen does grace you much Tiberio, Those favours are not common. Rosa. She is pleas'd For your sake Sir to cast some smile upon me; I know 'twas your request she should be kind, To keep my Heart a live. Ferd. Th'art not discover'd. Ros. Did not you discourse My story to her? Ferd. I? Ros. Take heed, yet this Will adde but a thin Feather to the scale Of my misfortune, she knows all, and in The pittie of my sufferings sayes you are Not worth my love, and calls you most ingratefull Ferd. We are both lost, till now there was some hope How to repair thy sorrow. Rosa. Do not mock me; 'Tis a worse tyranny than to kill, to laugh At what you have made wretched, 'tis as possible To call past ages back. Ferd. Take heed Rosania, And be not Judge of what thou know'st not, dearest. Rosa. I know too much. Ferd. That I am Married. Rosa. Ther's no truth in Man. Ferd. You are too rash; for there is truth in me, In Ferdinand, though in thy thoughts held black And staind prodigiously with breach of faith, I have not broke my vow, do not compell me By thy unbelief to do a Sin I hate As much as I love thee. Rosa. Have you a Soul? Ferd. Yes, and thy Eye shall read it, be but calm, That Soul, thou once didst love, white with his first Simplicity and faith; I wo'not urge In my excuse the beautie of the Queen Enough to melt a Scythian into love, But call to mind my dear Rosania, And do but put upon thee Ferdinand So late forgotten by his Stars, a prisoner, Slav'd like a villain at the bar, expecting At every breath his sentence, nay admit Rosania, the best part of his Soul Stood like a weeping fountain to take leave Of what she never must salute agen: In this extreme, to preserve Ferdinand And save Rosania, wouldst thou scorn the breath Of mercy, that did Court thee from the Lips Of a great Queen? couldst thou love Rosania, If thou wert Ferdinand to lose thy self? Whom she would follow in a stream of tears, And when she had made an iland of thy tomb, Striving to swim to thee, she could not choose, But drown her self in her own waves. I prethee Take reason to thee, and when th'ast consider'dâ Rosa. Perswade me I am not Rosania, And I will say 'tis virtue and that yet Your heart may grow with mine; is not the Queen Possest of that which should have been my title, A Wife to Ferdinand? Ferd. 'Tis confest the world Doth think it so, I did consent to ceremony. Ros. Call you injoying of the Queen but ceremony? Ferd. Pause there, and if thou hast but so much charity To think I dare not blaspheme Heaven, I'l call That, and the Angels boldly to my witness, The Queen's to me a stranger yet. Ros. A miracle. Ferd. Retain but love, as thou preserv'st thy sweetness, And that will teach thee to believe that Ferdinand, How ere saluted King is still thy subject, And though her Husband, in my faith to thee The Marriage-Bed hath still our Virgin sheets; A Brother might embrace a Sister, with The heat I brought; that this is truth, the power And name I have, shall only serve to make Our flight secure into another Kingdom, And when I part with these new shining glories, Thy faith will be confirm'd, and thou acknowledge I ventur'd much to keep my Heart thy servant. Ros. I know not what to say; is not the Queen Displeas'd? Ferd. She is, but cunningly disguiseth Her passion to the World; but I forgot What must inlarge my fears of her revenge If thou be known Rosania. Ros. Lose that fear, I am still safe, and now I see the cause Makes her repent her favours, and thy greatness; Forgive me Ferdinand, and yet I know not, All is not well ther's poyson in this Balsom Prepar'd for thee. Ferd. From whom? Ros. Rosania. Ferd. When she shall but consent to have me dye, She shall not trouble poyson to send off My despis'd life, my soul in just obedience To her command will take a cheerfull flight In hope to serve her in the other World. Ros. You shall know more hereafter, and let this Secure your thoughts, she yet beleeves me what This shape presents, but without wise prevention, I fear I shall not live too long conceal'd; I dare not say her honour is a bleeding, But a Queen thus distasted may not find That Ice within her bloud; we are interrupted. Enter Rodriguez. Rodri. Your pardon Sir; 'tis the Queens pleasure This Gentleman attend her in the Gallery. Ferd. He shall wait her commandsâ Ex. Rodri. I know not what to counsell, 'tis not safe Sweet to neglect her, yet my fears of some Ill fate, are round about me like a mist, And dark my understanding; let a kiss And silence teach our souls some new discourse. Capt. Why here's a volume of Intelligence I'l stay no longer to expect the Prince, But seek him out immediatly; disguises? King by your leave, I shall untruss your Mistress. Ex. Rosa. I know not what I feel, nor what to fear, If love e'r meant a Tragedie; 'tis here. Ferd. If we ne'r meet agen, one more salute Shall fortifie our lives by joyning breath, Nor shall our last hard fate deny us this, To change our faithfull Souls at our last kiss. Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Enter Rodriguez, Leandro, Ernesto. Ernest. I know not what to think on't, but if I Have any sense, there is some new state madness Crept into Court. Rodri. Are we not all a sleep, And these fine dreams perplex us? Leand. No 'tis waking. Rod. Shew me the tenth part of a reason why The Queen did Marry him. Lea. 'Twas destinie. Ernest. Why since should he be melancholy? Rod. Or she so humorus? Ernest. Not lie together? pray Heaven the Gentleman Be found with no defective title in him. Leand. Observe her favours to that Boy, he was His servant, now her minion. I like not These violent wheels; the whole frame may be soon Indanger'd, if these passions be not cur'd. Rod. New lodgings for him, neer her own, and he Given free access to the Bed-chamber. Leand. 'Tis naught Or will be so, I pittie the good King; Though she have rais'd him to the highest glorie Her power extended too, yet to make this height His precipice, and throw him into scorn, Nay poyson the best hopes he had of honour, And love from her, and in his sight to Court A Boy, his servant? It would vex the best Of all our tempers, if we felt the sting on't. Enter Rosania and Violinda (passing over the Stage.) Er. He's here, that Lady is the Queens Cabinet. Lean. They are merry about the Mouth. Er. Another summons? 'Tis possible the Queen may Marry him too. Lean. There is some mysterie we cannot reach. If we doe well remember, ther's a Law Made by her self, as soon as she was Queen, To keep Wifes Pulses temperat, and correct The insolent Bloud of Women that had Husbands. Er. And Men were not exempted. Leand. I say no more. But Heaven maintain the Law, and the Law-makers, And conjure down that Devill, 'Tis the King and the smooth Boy, lets leave 'em. Exeunt Lords. Enter Ferdinand, and Rosania. Ferd. Was this the Ladies Message? does the Queen Take thee into such favour? Rosa. I tell truth, And though it sound but ill on the Queens part, Because she thinks me what I seem my Lord, You need not to wear one Cloud upon your Face When you remember who I am, my fears Are thick upon my Heart, how to secure This shadow any longer. Ferd. That afflicts Me most Rosania, for it pleases me To hear she can affect thee; but what way To keep her expectation high, and thee (My dearest) safe? her passions may be violent. Rosa. They are already Sir, if I mistake not; I wish to Heaven that you were reconcil'd To do the office of a Husband to her, That peace would keep her Bosom clear, and I Should live to all the World except your self A stranger still. Ferd. What language speaks Rosania? Ther's death in every syllable, should I Obey what thou desir'st, and do the office Of a Husband, ha? Rosa. I'l wait upon you still, And hope you will vouchsafe me now and then A harmless smile; her beauty will deserve Your whole heart, and ther's something in the memory Of what she has advanc'd you to, will help To make you kind. Ferd. Should I injoy the Queen? Because the misery of my fate compeld A ceremonious sin? shall I betray The essence of my faith, and leave a curse, When thou art known, upon my name for ever? If thou hast taken new resolves against me, Punish my heart some other way; had she More ornament than ever met in woman, Mistress of more perfection, than Poets Invented for the Queen of love to this Were the proud Empire of the World her own, And she would make me Lord of her, and these, It would not buy me to the pleasure of One Nights embrace, my body shall not carry My soul so far astray; the Man condemnd To live in a perpetuall Snow, hath not A purer Frost within his blood. Rosa. This but Ingenders a new grief although it bind Rosanias Heart there is yet one way left And that ere I pronounce you must forgive; There is a trembling in my tongue and I Already feel such Winter in my breath, My timorous Lips do wither. Ferd. Do not fright My Soul too much, ther's something threatens me So like a loss of these, that I am left A peece of shaking Earth death cannot look To make me tremble so; canst thou forsake me? Ros. Not in my Heart, but give my body leave To seek some other place my Lord to dwell in. When I am gone into some wilderness, You will find ease at Heart, and love the Queen, And perfect all; I'l pray you may live happy, And hold Intelligence with some gentle Winds That shall convey my wishes and return What joys do follow you; the purling Rivers I'l teach your name, and they which glide this way Shall bring thee something Ferdinand of mine; My tears I know will not be lost, which I Will send thee daily by the courteous stream, Clear pledges of my faith; consent my Lord I may depart and you shall choose your way, To every blessing here. Ferd. Not till we meet With one embrace, and take our flight together; And I have thought a way to perfect it, Observe my sweet Rosania, the Queen Thou sayst affects thee, cherish it, with all The softness of her creature; if she allow, Kiss her, and promise what young lovers doe, Examine not, but by thy love to me Be free in amorous language, if she have Heat to a private meeting in her Chamber, Obey, this shall secure our loves ambition. Enquire not, but resolve, and let me know The time. Ros. You will attempt no violence Upon the Queen? Ferd. By thisâ Kisses her. Ros. What if she have commanded me This Night? Ferd. To meet? Ros. In her Bed-Chamber. Ferd. Ha! obey it. Ros. At a late hour. Ferd. It shall beget our comfort If thou consent. Rosa. But shall I not expose My self to danger, if her love persue Immodest ends, since you advise I should Apply my self to her desires? Ferd. If she Take too much flame, by some soft art delay her, Till I come to close all; keep still thy person Secret, the least discovery will destroy Us both; the Evening with much hast prepares Thy visit and our happiness. Rosa. I'l obey, But be you sure to come. Ferd. Lose thou no time Now to indear thee to her, let us part Love will find balm to cure the wounded Heart. Exeunt severally. A Table, and Lights, set out, then Enter Queen, and Violinda. Que. Was he not cheerfull when he promis'd thee? Viol. He was, and he was not. Que. I have a strange apprehension, and this doth feed it. Viol. I told him 'twas an honour worth his joyfull entertainment. Que. If it should prove successfull, my revenge Were perfect, I'm resolute to persueâ Viol. It makes well For your contrivement that the King and you do Lodge at distanceâstay, I hear a tread. Que. I hope 'tis he. Enter Leonario. Viol. Prince Leonario Madam. Que. What comes he for? Leon. Although I have small expectation For my own sake, that you can pardon Madam This bold access, and at so dark an hour, Yet when you have heard my business, You will know Your self so much concern'd, I'l not despair To find your mercy. Que. You prepare me for Something of consequence. Leon. Please you to dismiss Your Ladie, I have something to deliver Wo'not become her knowledge. Que. Leave usânow, Ex. Violinda. Our conference is free, your Graces pleasure? It must be matter of much essence, that Could not expect till morning, but y'ar welcome. Leon. This time and darkness Madam best becomes him, Who for your sake blushes to see the Day, But I came not to chide my wrongs have learn'd A modest silence, my approach is not To name a suffering of mine, but to Discover what already is prepar'd Against your peace and honour. Que. Is it treason? Leon. It is, but threatens not your life, you may Live many years upon the wound. Que. You fright me. Leon. Lose not the beauty of your cheek so soon, Hide not beneath that cold and killing Snow, One Rosie blush, and yet that pale would shew Like Innocence which you have lost; oh Madam Had you not made a forfet of your truth To me, no storm could shake you, but your soul That made no change, could know no fear; I come To tell you what just providence hath done In my revenge, your breach of vow is punish'd With loss of faith in him, to whom you gave The Heart you promis'd me, the King, whose pride You built on my dishonour, is as falses, As you were. Que. This is passion but be Not yet too rash in censuring him. Whom I Have plac'd so neer, I must defend, nor will He need my strength, to make their blood account That dare traduce his honour; he has a Heartâ Leon. A false one. I was born without a fear, And dare upon his bosom (wear he worth The manly contestation) write him perjur'd. Que. I would this were not envy; but admit He be thus guiltie, 'tis a fault in him. Leon. No Madam, it is yours; that sin that poysond The expectation of my joys in you, Hath made him false and will excuse his storie, When you are nam'd that broke your faith to me; I can have no hope now to be repair'd, But if it be worth memorie to know The triumph waits on Innocence, the World Shall say the Queen deserv'd to meet a scorn Deep as her wrongs to me. Que. It cannot be. Leon. Think so, and help to make the revenge greater, Till the winds catch the black report, and multiply The shame, by scattering it about the Kingdom, Sit still, and careless of your fame, incourage His private lust, his Mistress now in Court. Que. A Mistriss in the Court? Leon. Yes Madam, in the Court, And may one day think any second place Too narrow to contain her greatness, sheâ Que. As y'ar a Prince no more; I have done ill, And find the penance here, It does agree With his neglects, and addes new flame to my Young jealousie; I feel a tempest rising; By all your goodness leave me Sir; I cannot Now right you more than mourn, and give belief to you. No more I pray you, by all your love to honour. Leon. I ha' done, And take my leave, my everlasting leave, 'Tis time; how like the day, that flatterd us With cheerfull light, are my desires fled hence, And left me here a prodigie of darkness, A walking Herse, hung round about with night, Whose wings must one day cover all? farewell. If any Star look forth, it is to call Me hence, and light me to another World. Our Lips are never like to meet agen. Kisses Farewell, if I but stay, I shall forgive her. Exit. Que. A Mistress in the Court? something is busie About my Heart. Enter Violinda. Viol. The Prince is gone. Que. No matter. Affronted thus? but I forgot to ask Her name that rivals me; how this passion Befools our understanding, and prevents The knowledge, and the cure of what afflicts us! The Morning will assure all, but shall this Strike me to ashes? I may find a way To my revenge. Enter Violinda. Viol. Tiberio is come Madam. Que. Wait carefully. Viol. I know my dutie. Enter Rosania: (Kneels and Kisses her Hand.) Que. Rise, This meeting was not meant for ceremony, Ther's something in this presence will deserve We should put off all state, and speak like friends. You must be cover'd too. I'l have it so. We are private now. Rosa. These graces will Undoe a youth, whose birth, and careless Stars Ordain'd him to be humble, and with dutie Wait on your meanest servant. Que. Thou shalt soon have cause To think thy Stars are carefull of thee, if Thou canst be wise. Rosa. Alas! my years are few. Que. Thy knowledge is not wanting to distinguish Whose favours Court thee, and apply thy self To understand, and thank the kind bestower; 'Tis in my power to make thee great. Rosa. You may Advance this worthless walking shadow Madam, And when you like the free and bounteous Sun Have blest me with your rayes, it is but like His glorious warmth bestow'd upon a peece Of rude and barren Earth, which takes not from The lustre of your Beams, but shews more clearly, By your own light, what poverty you shin'd on. Quee. This modesty becomes you not, look in My eie, and read what's there. Rosa. Some thing like anger, Enough to strike me dead. Quee. What now? Rosa. A smile, And such attending sweetnessâ Quee. Thus it shall Invite thee still to gaze, and love, Tiberio, No frown shall point on thee; I finde my eyes Were meant for thee, and all they grac'd before, But objects of mistake. Here, here, O turn Thy lovely face away, lest I be seen To blush, my heart hath chose to place my love And the reward; this would become thy tongue A great deal better, Come sit down Tiberio. What still an Infants understanding? Think I am the man, and learn a little better, What beauty dwells upon this hand, What softness, How like the Snow, or Innocence it shews, Yet fires my heart with every gentle touch. Rosa. Dear Madam; would the King would come. Que. This is a happiness that Kings should sue for, And yet there are poor comforts in these Kisses; Let hands preserve Societie with hands, And with their change of whiteness, and of Balm, Make wealthy one another: But let what Was mean't for kisses meet, and finde out pleasure By warm exchange of souls from our soft lips. Kisses. Madam, how like you this? Rosa. Madam. Que. I suppose you a Lady all this while, And I the man, our lips must meet again, Will this instruct thee nothing? Ros. Gracious Madam. Que. And yet this recreation comes short, Dear Lady, of what love might well allow us. Admit you are a Queen, you are not bound To thin your Royal Blood with frost, but as Your power, your pleasure should exceed; nay graut You have a man (a man said I) that can Keep love alive, and warm a yielding bosom, Yet where from the invitement of your eie, And amorous choice, I am become your servant, You may be a little kinder. Rosa. Madam, I know not How with the safetie of my self, my dutie, And your own name and power, to understand you, (Yet this to some would need but little Comment) Can you place such a value on a thing That not deserves to breath your name? Or should I hope these charms of Language you have spred To catch my heart, which hath no wings, but where It can believe; For you transcend so much In wonder of your love, a willing Faith Not easily can reach it. But dear Madam, I know all this is but to try my duty, And you have pleas'd to choose me forth, to make These silent hours more grateful, by the mirth My weak replies may raise you, Que. Miracle! I but imagin'd thee a woman, now I shall believe thee one indeed; this coldness Becomes no masculine habit. Come, we'll in, And change our Sexes; Thou shalt wear my clothes, And I will put on these, help on with thine, And I will dress thee handsomely, and then We'll act again. Ros. Not for the world dear Madam. Not yet come? Que. The world? This confirms my jealousie. I'll search you to the soul, Adonis come, I'll call thee so, and court thee with more charm Than Venus did, when in the Idalian Groves To buy a kiss, she offer'd the proud Boy Her flaming Chariot, and her Doves of Snow. 'Tis in thy power to make thy fate and heart More happy by consent to meet with mine; Tempt not the anger of a Queen despis'd, Whose breath can like a whirl-wind snatch thee up, And drop thee in a Wilderness, where with sorrow For thy neglect, thou by degrees maist sigh Thy self into a Mist, which no Sun-beam Shall pitie or take up into a Cloud. But love me, and compose thy heart to mine, Wee'l live with more delight, than fancie can Inrich Elizium with. The soft hours shall stay Till we allow 'em Wings, and while we kiss And on each others Lips breath Incense thus, Wee'l have ten thousand Cupids for our guard, Whose Bows shall awe the destinies, and we write The King and Queen of Fate. Enter Ferdinand, Leandro, Rodriguez, Ernesto, Captain, Guard. Ferd. Will this deserve your faith? Leand. We must believe. Enter Violinda. Viol. We are undone, the King. Que. False Keys? Rosa. 'Twas time to come. Ferd. Had I not cause, my Lords, to appear sad, When I suspected this so great affront? My melancholy all this while was but A mourning for this shame: Look but my Lords Into your selves, and make this suffering yours. Viol. Madam be rais'd again, I have an art To fetch you off with honor, and the youth too. I will perswade him there can be no cure In this extream but to pretend himself A woman; I will dress him in your Gown Before they can be ware on't; they all know This way he cannot flie, mean time put on A confidence, and let them know you are The Queen, not to be shaken with their power; This will gain time. Que. Prosper in this. Viol. I will Redeem my fault, or never sleep again. Exit with Rosania. Ferd. She blushes not. Were she not Queen, what names could we bestow Upon this want of modesty? Leand. 'Tis plain. We came in time. Ferd. Most happily to prevent Some further act of shame; can she look on us Without a blush? Que. I see no such attraction In your state faces that I should desire Much to look on 'em. Who made you King I pray? Ferd. Your power, I dare not call it love, presuming That I was fit to be your property, Without a soul to see, or have a sense Of these dishonors; This rank hear of blood, Madam, what penitence can make this clear? Admit your thoughts were wanton, and your flame, Too great to be supprest, could you finde none For your adulterate embrace, but one That was my servant? my own hound devour me? As if your lust had not enough of shame And mischief to me, but your malice must Appear in't too; with what securitie Can I expect to live, when she begins So soon to poyson me? Leand. We heard her say They two would write themselves the King and Queen. Rod. So we did all. Ferd. You may consider these. Leand. 'Tis impious Madam with what grief do we Remember now that Law you made After your Corronation to preserve The name of your sex chast which gave our Hearts Hope of your blessed progress; you made it death To stain the Marriage-bed; where shall we expect The life of that good act, when you begin A breach of chastitie by so black example? If the King urge an Execution Of what our vote confirm'd by yours impos'd Upon the kingdom you should prove your self More innocent or give us cause to mourn This fall from virtue Er. Madam we grieve for you. Que. So, so, have your great wisdoms said all yet? I laugh at you (poor things) and am so far From trembling at your thunder, that I pitty you, And first I'l let you know you selves, you are I take it all my subjects, I will not Exempt you Sir, since Marriage takes not off My Interest, and Essence here, all strength Flowing from me, and your Derivative shine Extinct, when I frown you to darkness; by What power dare you take an accompt of me? That am above your Laws, which must obey Me, as their Soul, and Dye when I forsake 'em? But I will reason coolely, and admit They live in force; 'gainst whom? are you so shallow, To think we that created, and decreed 'em For vulgar reformation, must be squard And Levell'd by 'em, as we meant to lose Our Character and distinction, and stoop Toth' common file of subjects? this were policy! I speak not this with sense of any guilt, So to decline it, for I here defie you, And bring an Innocence shall strike a blush Upon your Souls; that sinn'd in my suspition. Aside. Ferd. Where is the Boy? Ernesto take him to Your custodie, and bid him not despair, I have contriv'd the rest. Enter Rosania (like a Woman) and Violinda. Er. He's here. Viol. Take it upon you, if it come to searching Wee'l find a Jurie. Capt. You are deceiv'd my Lord, with your good pardon, He is not here. Er. Who is not here? Capt. The he you do expect; And your Officious Ladyship might well Have spar'd your pains, to put on all this trim. Ferd. What means the fellow? Capt. 'Tis no news to your Sir. I could have told the Queen before and you My honourable Lords, this was no Boy, Though now he would but seem o'th' tother sex, I knew her name. Ros. My name? Capt. Are not you call'd Rosania? Ferd. Ha! betraid? Capt. Yes indeed is she, you were present Sir I'th' Garden when this fine Hermophrodite Declar'd what sex was hid behind the Breeches, And this I certified the Prince before. Que. Now 'tis clear. Capt. There are some tokens too I can remember, As kisses, and excuse for marrying with The Queen, a Virgin still, &amp;c. Omnes. A Woman? Viol. But are you a Woman indeed? Capt. And now my Lords, if you have Hearts that are Honest and daring, come about agen, For this is but a cunning piece of treason, Against your Faith, and the Queens honour. Ferd. We are both lost Rosania. Capt. 'Tis truth, or take my Head off. Que. You do believe this transformation, And know this Ladie, my good Lord, I did Suspect before the cause of your neglects, And meeting with some dark Intelligence From the Prince, to perfect this discovery, Did in my Chamber wooe with aptest forms Of Love, to trie how long the sex would be Conceal'd; you heard a part, and see us kiss, And came in time with these wise Noblemen To prevent further acts of shame. Rodri. I'st possible? Rosa. It was an ill contrivement to make me Proof of the Queens dishonour. Er. An apparent Plot Against the life and honour of the Queen, Since he would urge that Law maliciously Against her, knowing this to be a Woman, And his close strumpet. Rodri. The same Law must be Their tryall. Leand. What a change is here already? Que. You must not Lords deny me Justice. Rodri. 'Tis insufferable Against a common person. Er. Let his first Treason, if you think good Madam, be urg'd In accusation. Leand. So, so. Que. You did us service Captain. Capt. I am bound too't, heres more news for the Prince. Que. Use your pleasures. Exit. Rod. What need we circ?stance, let him dye to morrow. Que. Death will be mercie to so much ingratitude, Command them both to severall custodies. The morning shall behold 'em deadâ Ros. Now more lost then ever. Exeunt. Manent. Ferd: Ros. &amp; Guard. Ferd. Pray lets take Short leave of one another, 'tis in vain To reason against providence, or say We might ha' liv'd; though I must dye, and after Be hid in my obscurest name, and shade, I must declare whose blood they will profane In bleeding thee; farewell, our last, last kiss. My heart would fain come to thee, I will make it My humble sute with my last breath it may Be quickly sent thee. Rosa. We shall both meet, when This dust falls off, and our souls kiss agen. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Enter Leandro, Rodriguez, Ernesto, Servants with Lights. Er. My Lord you tell us wonders, 'tis high time To open such a mysterie. Rodri. This change Will exceed all, and so convincing are The circumstances of this great discovery They do command our faith. Er. And you shall steer us. Leand. Then let us lose no time; oh my good Lords, Did you but feel the torment of my bosome, Till I discharge the duty, which so long Hath slept in his concealment, you would call For wings to flye, and think all motion tedious; For Heavens sake lets make hast, that we prevent The morning, which will rise upon this knowledge With cheerfull beams, and put on all his glory. Er. Most gladly we attend. Exeunt. A Table and Taper set out. Enter Ferdinand (with a book in his Hand.) Ferd. I have no Heart to think of any thing But my Rosania, all devotion, When I remember her, flyes off, and leaves My soul no contemplation but her safety; They were too cruell to divide us, night It self looks now more black by this dim taper; Rosania's eyes would brighten all, but they Weigh'd down with sleep, and sorrow, are perhaps At rest, a thousand Angels watch about 'em; And let some one whose office is to wait On harmless love, present me to her dreams; O let her hear me often call upon her, As I am led to death, and when the stroke Divides me from my self, and from the World, My Heart shall pay her tribute, and my blood Do miracles, when every Crimson drop My Body bleeds, shall not in vain be wept, But fall into some Letter of her name, To keep alive our story. Enter two Servants (with Torches) Leandro, Ernesto, Rodriguez. What lights are these? This place sure is not wont to be thus visited. They are spirits, ha! yet if I have a memory Those Faces were but late familiar to me. They Kneel. What mockery is this? if you be substances Of things I know, go tell the Tyrant Queen She might allow me death without this scorn, This jeering Antimasque. Omnes. Long live the King. Ferd. What King? Omnes. Long live Ferdinand King of Murcia. Ferd. A dream, a golden dream. What fancies wait Upon our sleep? and yet I wake, they are Apparitions, I'l shut my eyes, and lose 'em. They wo'not vanish, Leandro, Rodriguez, Ernesto? Omnes. All your subjects. Leand. Collect your scatterd thoughts my Lord, and be Assur'd, we now pay reall duties to you, You are our King, and must be. Ferd. Who says so? Leand. I, whose cold fear, and frailty, When fate of War had made you Prisoner, Conceal'd the truth, and Justice of your title, 'Twas I that sav'd you from your Uncles fury And sent you to Valentia, while I cozen'd The kingdom with your death, till time might ripen Your challenge to the scepter; if you can Find mercy to a treason, great as this, I'l live, and study how to merit pardon. Ferd. Rise, rise all, And if you be Leandro, pray come neerer. Rod. Pray Heav'n this unexpected happiness Meet with no extasie, all senses are Not arm'd for such extremes of Joy. Er. The Queen, When she finds this, will fall into a Feaver, By instinct her Head must ake this very minute. Rod. And shake too, for the Crown is tottering. Ferd. Pardon? thou shouldst divide the kingdom with me. But do all these believe it, will you not, When I make second claim, deny me agen? Call me Impostor? Leand. Sir forgive that first, And I'l not ask Heaven pardon for my next Deniall, let death threaten all his stings; And I have satisfied these Lords so well, They are confirm'd in your just claim, and person. Rod:, Er. We lay our lives and fortunes at your feet. Ferd. I may command you then, fetch me Rosania; I'l be no King without her; do not stay To hear how much I love her 'bove the Crown, And all the glories wait upon it, she That was my Page, my fellow Prisoner, Rosania. Exit Rodrig. 'Tis that name next to Heaven I bow too. Good my Lord follow him, and if she be Awake, oh drop it gently by degrees, (The joy is mighty, she a sad weak Virgin) That I shall live to make her Queen. Exit Ernesto. Stay you, and if I play too much the wanton with My fate, or swell with expectation, Speak something to allay my hopes, and say There may be crosses yet, the Queen may want Faith or consent, or put case the people (A dangerous torrent to oppose) like not This Innovation, where is the King then? Leand. Doubt not their Loves, you had their Hearts before; Let nothing shake you. Enter Rosania, Ernesto, Rodriguez. Ferd. Th'art my better Angell. Why then if my Rosania will be Queen, The kingdoms ours agen; she comes, she comes. Thou mak'st too little hast to be a Queen. I am my self agen, my name is sound, I shall live to, thus to embrace Rosania Without a fear, these Lords are all thy subjects, I am a King. Leand. You are. Ferd. Then what must my Rosania be? Ros. Happy, if this be more Than dream, my tears and sufferings are all paid for If this be true. Leand. Most true. Ros. What a strong arm Hath Heaven? Ferd. See how the Day hath made Hast to salute Rosania, and to wait Upon thy triumph, blushes like a Maid When she is told she is in Love, the Stars Are gone to tell the other World, thy beauty, Till now Ecclips'd with sorrow, hath thrown off The imprisoning veil, and shines above their brightness. But how shall we Leandro now contrive For our Court entertainment, where the Queens Prepar'd to hear our Tragedy? Leand. Leave me To order your appearance; but first Sir, We must secure this Fort. Er. The Captain is My creature. Ferd. Thou shalt be all our direction. Come my Rosania, time hath turn'd a gen Our Glass, and his keen sith this comfort brings, It cuts no scepters down but to make Kings. Exeunt. Enter Leonario (reading a Letter,) and Soldier. Leon. So neer? Sold. We heard before of your affront My Lord, and were prepar'd. Leon. It hath outstrip'd my expectation, These Letters say Mendoza is their Generall new return'd With victory from the Moores; his fame I honour, My knowledge never reach'd his person. Sold. Sir, he brings old Soldiers with him, the Commanders Are such, whose faith and valor in those Wars Already tried, he durst name to the King To be employ'd here in your highness cause. Leand. We will to Horse immediatly. I long To salute the Army. Sold. Which but wants your person The Soul of their design; you may soon reach 'em. Enter Captain. Leon. I will. Capt. Your Grace. Leon. That we had wings, away, to Horse to Horse. Exeunt Leon. Sold. Capt. Speed, and you be so hot o'th' spur, my business Is but breath, and your design it seems rides post. Enter Lieutenant and Antient. The Earth runs upon wheels; whom do I spy? My extraordinaries, I'l ha' sport with them, But first observe 'em. Lieut. I see no profit in these offices That we ha' brought. Ant. Not extraordinary, as the name did promise. Capt. The Rogues are poor, and now repent. Ant. We were told by the cheating Captain That we should want Men to tell our money. Lieut. This 'tis to deal with Soldades. Ant. We should command the Ladies too, and we Were bountifull, a small Pox take their beauties, 'Tis the greater curse, I have undone My self in giving away enameld Rings And Bracelets. Lieut. Well, if I trust a Captain agen. Ant. Or I. Capt. I'm glad they are payd; I wo'not leave 'em, I feel my antipathy strong yet. Ant. I would venture half my soul to be reveng'd If I knew how. Capt. True Rascals! Lieut. The Ladies love him. Ant. They all Love Men of War. Lieu. Would his poop were a fire. Ant. And Battels in Bed naturally. Lieu. Well, what Ladies give him hereafter to buy new Feathers, may his body compell him to bestow upon a Surgeon. Ant. May Diseases undermine his Flesh like Gunpowder, And blow all his skin up into blisters. Lieu. May they that look for his Nose, go about for want of a bridge, and let him wear no Legs but what he buyes from the Carpenter. Ant. May his face break out, and undo him in taffata, and may the patches at the last be so many, till his skin be invisible, and his goggle eyes look through a Mask. Lieu. May he live to be as much coward as we ha' been, and be beaten! Ant. Abominably beaten, and may the miracle be on our side, that we may be valiant, and be the Men to doe it, oh I would have no more mercy.â Capt. Save you Gallants, save you Courtiers. Both. My noble Captain. Ant. It may be he did not hear us. Capt. Hark you, what purchase have you two made lately? Both. Of what? Capt. Of Lands and loggerheads, Lordships I would say, I know you are both rich, you cannot choose, But I will borrow no more o' you, faith besatisfied and leave off in time with the wealth you have. Lieu. Where is it Captain? Ant. Can you tell where we may borrow as much money upon our extraordinary places, as will set up shop agen? For this Court trade wo'not do. Capt. How? Lieu. No indeed Captain, we ha' made little benefit since we came to be extraordinaries. Capt. Ye took not the right way then. Ant. That may be. Capt. Why, cannot you lie, and swear, and pawn your souls for six pence, the Devill could not furnish the City with two more hopefull Borachios. You have a Carrot-colourd Beard, and that never fails, and your worships face is a prognostication of preferment Is a Prognostication of preferment, where Beside Dominicall Letters, you have all the Conjuring Characters of the Planets. But all this is your cunning, to dissemble your estates. Lieu. By this empty pocket, I have but one Shirt Capt. You jeast y'faith. Ant. And by all my no money, I have but half a one left. Capt. Come, come, you took up linnen lately, I heard You did. Ant. I, smocks. Capt. Why they are in fashion with extraordinary Courtiers. But if you be in earnest, I can tell, where you May furnish your selves richly. Both. Where? where? Capt. W'y in the Shops for ready money, but you would Save charges. Ant. I marry Captain. Capt. Venture to rob a hedge, it is but hanging, And whats that to men extraordinary? But if your wants be reall, be not dejected, I'l set you up agen my self, I have been Beholding to you two for your good words And wishes Gentlemen. Lieu. It pleases you to say so, I begin To smell.â Ant. Not to us Captain, we have been beholding to you. Capt. And it happens, as if fortune had made you miserable A purpose, to bless you both with such a preferment, as wo'not be offerd agen in a Coronation. Lieu. On good Captain, for we are extraordinary miserable. Capt. Then observe; you are not ignorant how things go at Court, the King is in prison. Ant. So. Capt. And his wench with him that walk'd in Breeches; The Queen resolves they shall both dye. Ant. Good. Capt. This morning too; now in regard the King is a person of qualitieâ Lieu. I think he be. Capt. And the tother a Lady, as some imagine, you two may do very well to undertake nowâ Both. Any thing. Capt. To be a couple of Hangmen: d'ee mark? to dispatch the Queens enemies in what horrid way, her counsell shall think convenient, you will do service to the State, and have extraordinary rewards; besides the honour and reputation of your places; what say? 'tis my pure love to make this first offer to you. Ant. Do we look like a couple of Hangmen? Capt. No you ha' not so good a complexion; and now I think on't you sha'not live to have that preferment come, draw you that wear your Sword like a Bum-baly, do as I bid you, and that quickly. Ant. It wo'not come out Sirâ Cap. No.âthis shall in thenâ Ant. I will put more strength to't. Capt. So now, d'ee markâkill one another. Both. Kill one another? Capt. Yes and doo't religiously, with as much alacrity as you would devour an Orphan: and do't hansomly, that you may not be hangd when you are dead. I'l see't done he that is dull shall have my goad to quicken him:â They fight. So, good, good agen, well offer'dâthey fight by these Hilts Furiously now cou'd I forgive 'emâso, enough. Lieu. This is very fine sport. Capt. Necessity has taught 'em the noble science, come, if all fail, you shall fight challenges; ther's mony and broken Pates to be got that way you can make legs, and gape like Gudgins for benevolence, cut scurvy capers, to shew your Legs are well, when your Head bleeds; farewell; stay, you want money, I had forgot, there is twelve pence apiece for you. Both. How Captain? I hope not. Capt. They are not hearty yet, they think I serve 'em with Press money agen, no, tis my pure bountie. Go, set up agen, and trust Souldiers, without impertinent asking for your debts; they'l pay you. Ant. As you ha' done. Capt. I'l hearken how you behave you selves farewell. When you are rich, I'l visit you agen, and borrow money. Lieu. Too much is too much; humh. Ant. Now have I a great mind to fight with your Captainship. Lieu. So have I, now my Hands in, methinks 'tis nothing. Capt. You are not desperate? Ant. We are a little better, as good be Hang'd for killing of you Captain, as live after the rate of our disgrace. I am resolv'd. Capt. Two Mastives at once may worry me. I am put too't. They fight. Must we have tother 'bout. Ant. This is enough at once we may come too't in time. Capt. Why now I love you, love you, as well as you do Law. Ant. Upon good terms we love you too. Capt. Let's shake Hands, you sha'not to your vomit agen. Now you dare sight, I'l tell you a hundred wayes to get moneys, come, wee'l drink and divide fortunes, Run not back into cows agen. Ant. I'l be Antient now agen. Lieu. And I Lieutenant. Capt. Both my own Boyes. Ant. 'Tis not so hard to fight I see, if a Man be but desperate, and give his mind too't, Lieu. Pox a Cowards; come Captain. Capt. Let me hug ye my brace of Mirmidons, And drink a Tun of Wine to this conversion. Exeunt. Enter Queen, Violinda. Que. The Prince so early met upon the way This morning sayst? and with a Souldier? Vio. And in that hast too, Madam I was told The speed of Wings was slow, their fiery Horse Bathing in foam, yet fled as if they meant To leave the Wind, and Clouds behind 'em. Que. Strange! I could have wish'd him with less discontent To have left us, but my stubborn fate design'd it; Having thus snatch'd away himself, it will Become us to compose, and make the best Of our State game; I sent a Messenger With our command, to th'Governor of the Fort, He should attend the King by the Water-gate Leads to the Garden, we do purpose conference; If Ferdinand wisely consent to break The Magick that so chains his Heart to that Idoll Rosania, wee'l be reconcil'd, And Peace shall marry once agen our Hearts. Enter Courtier. Me thinks our Lords are cold in their attendance, Where be our train of Ladies?ânay permit 'em, A solitude becomes this sullen Day, And our own thoughts; methinks thou dost not look With thy own face upon me. Vio. Not I Madam? Que. My eyes have lost their virtue, all I look on Have not the shape and colour they presented, What whispers that? ha'? Viol. Here was none Madam. Que. I could be jealous of the Wind methinks, And quarrell with the postures of those very Shapes i'th' Arras; fie Olivia, call home thy reason. Court. O Madam! Que. What horror's in that voice? I see a treason In's looks. Court. O Madam, I beseech your pardon. Que. Why? art a traitor? Court. Not I, but there are practices I fear Against your royal person; the Court gates Are shut, all's in confusion within, And I could hear abroad loud acclamations And triumph for the King, as he were new proclam'd. Enter Captain. Que. Which way comest thou? Cap. Over the Wall Madam; the gates are shut, I'l tell you news; young Ferdinand your Husband Is in all state attended, and proclam'd King in his own right, he is prov'd to be What he did first pretend himself, Leandro, And all the Lords confirm't, the Governor Hath given him up the Fort, the wise City Her Keys and every officer on's knees Is praising and drinking the Kings health, Que. Away, and let thy face be seen no more, But when the fatall noise of fire, some blood, Or buriall calls thee forth. Capt. This my reward For bringing news the King's alive? take heed, Do not talk treason in your own defence,âhark Enter (in state) Rodriguez, Ernesto, Leandro, Ferdinand, (who takes the Throne) Attendants. Que. From what an expectation am I faln! Omnes. Long live Ferdinand King. Ferd. We thank you; and will study to be worth Your prayers and dutie; Madam, the Chancelor Can cleer, and bring your faith to allow the wonder, We are no Impostor now nor need we borrow A beam from you to make us shine, yet still You are our Cosen, fair Olivia, Enter Rosania and Ladies. The Husband was a title long since due To my Rosania, may it prosper here. Our love and years grew up together, and Our Souls by holy contract tied, when in Alfonzo's House, her Father, and my Guardian (To whose trust I was sent an Infant by Leandro) We plighted faith; it is no blemish To fair Olivia still to be a Virgin, Though she have lost the Queen, she is a Princess. And hath now found a Kinsman, that shall study What shall become his love, her blood and honour. Upon your Lip I print this fair assurance. Rosa. And mine shall be to do you service Madam. Que. If this be true, you must command my dutie. Ferd. We hear Prince Leonario is departed, When he shall know the progress of our fortunes Hee'l quit his Stars, that hid their golden Heads To mock him with a small Eclipse, o' purpose To light him with more glorie to his happiness. Soft Alarum Ha? what clamors that? the frightfull noise increases. Enter first Guard. Guard. Flie, and save your selves, the Fort's surpris'd By the Prince of Arragon, whose troups have seiz'd the City, reeling with Wine, and careless of their strength, in their joyes for you Sir. Ferd. The Prince of Arragon? the fates cannot Be so injust, so envious of our blessing, To snatch it from us in a minute; ha? Help, help, quarter. Divers within cry. Ferd. They are i'th' Court already. Leand. We are all undone, Lets yield and ask conditions honourable. Ferd. Dye he, that dares but think so, yeeld? no, Ferdinand Was here too late a Prisoner; let us sell Our lives at glorious rates, the Evening puts A Mask upon the horror, follow me. Exit. Leand. To certain death; Ladies stay you, the danger Will meet us here to soon, and yet your persons In honour challenge safety. Ex. Lords. Que. Is there no end of my distractions? Or hath my folly yet deserv'd more vengeance? Rosa. It cannot be Heaven will so soon destroy The blessing it bestow'd if thus you punish Whom you advance, who will believe your gifts Are more than flattery to betray our Peace? Enter Leonario, Alfonso, Ferdinand, (Prisoner,) Rodriguez, Ernesto, Souldiers. Leon. This Ladie is my prize. Que. How Sir your prize? Leon. Mistake me not, ther's no dishonour meant Your person; yet I boldly may pronounce You are, and must be mine. I am not ignorant You are a Virgin all but name, be wise As you are fair, and I forget what's past, And take this satisfaction; if I meet Contempt, where I with honour once more Court you, You will create a flame shall never dye But in the Kingdoms ashes; you were mine First by your own election, seal'd above, If I must lose what Heaven bestow'd upon me The quarrell is not mine But virtues, whose right Hand is arm'd with Justice? Enter Captain. Punish not where you owe your Heart, but let Both our revenges meet in that Impostor; I find your noble Soul return; Lord Generall While I retire with this fair Queen, whom not One violent accent shall affright, much less A rude attempt, take hence that counterfet, And cut his Head off. Ros. O my dearest Lord? Leon. The rest may if they please find mercy. Capt. I were best be o' this side. Leon. Away with him. Ferd. Insulting Prince, thou darest not. Leon. How Sir, dare not? Ferd. I said it, Thy better, being a King, in my own right, Without her charitie, proclam'd and justified, By Birth a Prince. Leand. All this is truth Sir. Leon. You must not Cozen thus my faith, away; Cut off his Head. Alfon. Dispatch you with the Queen, Let me alone to make his Head secure. Leand. Nay take mine too. I'l wait on him in death, It shall begin my service. Ros. Cruell Prince. Que. What fate must I obey? Ros. My death will adde some lines Unto thy bloody Chronicle; pray let us dy together. Leon. You shall speak, her sentence Madam. Que. She must live then. Leon. To all we offer mercie, but to Ferdinand, His doom is fixt; come Madam. Que. Whither Sir? Leon. I know the way to your Chappel, he that loves us Make hast, and bring the Priest. Capt. That's I, I know Her Chaplains, they are my friends, and all good fellows. Exit. Ferd. Pray can you tell me, where, or what I am Or what I must do next? Alfon. Yes, you must dye. Ferd. Let not that grieve you Gentlemen, 'tis nothing To part with life, and if but my Rosania would not weep Methinks I could shake off this dust, and leap To Immortality without a guide, And in that cheerfull flight prepare the blest With so much praise and wonder of thy virtue, They shall be more in love with thee, than I, And double all their prayers to bring thee to 'em. Ros. No we will dye together. Alf. You shall. Ferd. How? Alf. Both live, and love, and bless my age the witness. D'ee know me? Rosa. Father? Ferd. Guardian. Leand. Alfonso, my noble Kinsman. Alf. How joyes flow in my Heart, to see this constancy! Ferd. How came you to be his? Alf. I have deceiv'd the Prince, our forces are Valentia's, Not Arragons, which he by Letters sent for In his revenge, but we met the Intelligence And arriv'd sooner, to pretend our selves The Armie he expected; you shall know more hereafter. Ferd. I want a knowledge where to begin my gratitude, The joyes you bring are mighty, and overcome us. O my Rosania? Ros. This was beyond hope. Enter Captain. Capt. So, so, 'tis done, he has mumbled up the ceremony; A compendious Priest may do much in few words; They are fast enough; the Queen was wise to take him; You are onely like to be a loser Sir; they come. Enter Leonario, Queen. Alfon. All joyes to the Prince of Arragon, and the fair Olivia. Leon. Why not the Queen Olivia? Alfon. Not while this Gentleman's Head is on, believe it. Leon. Where is Mendoza? Alfon. Hid within this bushâ But here's Alfonso Generall of the Army Sent from Valentia to assist King Ferdinand To his native right. Leon. Valentia? Alfon. My Master having faild in his first aids To Ferdinand, intended not sit down With so much loss but rais'd another Army, Which in our march consulted our security By Interception of all passages; Your messenger by a party was surpriz'd, Him, stubborn to discover what he was, Imperfect in his answer, we Interpreted Some spie, and searching found your Letters fraught With mischief and revenge, these sent to our King We had command to hasten our design, And steer our course by Sea to Carthagena, How after we arriv'd, we gaind your faith And purposes, Your highness knows. Leon. Betrayd? Alfon. Sir, be a Prince, and just to your own honour, And having perfected your fair desires With her, we hope you will account your self Most happy that you mist a power to serve Further revenge upon a lawfull Prince, My Soldiers will obey me now, although To help your Marriage I appear'd no friend To Ferdinand. Leand. Who was the Prince preserv'd By me, and sent an Infant to this Lord, My noble Kinsman. Alfon. Him I bred, till time And strength might arm him to return, and claim His own. Leon. Leandro denied this before. Leand. To my dishonour, 'twas a coward fear To lose my self unprofitably Leon. I apprehend with wonder. Ferd. If you repent not love and our alliance, She shall be worth your best embrace, and we Forgetfull of your passion, entertain you With all affection to our blood. Leon. I meet it, And satisfied in this story, Joy I was Prevented; I congratulate your Stars Sir; Nor is this treasure of less price to me Than when her Temples were enchac'd with Empire. Que. This love will give my soul another form. Ferd. Our storie hath been full of change, but love Hath met a glorious victory, and tied Our souls together with most firm embraces. My Lord Leandro you shall to Valentia, With our best thanks and greeting to the King; His Armies charge is ours beside what else We owe his Royall bountie. Once more welcome Alfonso now my Father, witness I Preserve my faith to my Rosania, I hear the Priest call us to other rites, His Altar doth expect another pair, Make hast to light his Tapers with thine eyes And make our hearts each others Sacrifice. Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue, Captain. Gentlemen, I am no Epilogue, I come to pray You'd tell me your opinion of the Play, Is the Plot current? may we trust the wit Without a Say-Master to autorise it? Are the lines Sterling? do they hold conceit? And every peece with your allowance, weight? That when you come abroad, you'l not report You are sorry to have given white money for't? So, so, I know your meaning, now pray tell How did the action please ye, was it well? How did King Stephen do, and tother Prince? Enough, enough, I apprehend, and since I am at questions w'ee, tell me faith How do you like the Captain? ha? he saith, I'l tell you, y'are my friends, none here, he knows, I mean you o'the Gentry, t'whom he ows No money, will enter a false action, And let the rest look too't, if there be one, Among his City creditors, that dares, He hath vow'd to press, and send him to the Wars.
