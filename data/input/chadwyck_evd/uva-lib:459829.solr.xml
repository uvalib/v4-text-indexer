      <field name="fulltext">Friendship Improv'd; OR, THE Female Warriour. A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Edward Coke, of Norfolk Esq.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Long has our Author beat his addled Brains To purchase Fame, but can't find Ways, and Means. They talk of Fame, but 'tis the thought of many, They ne'er regarded that, nor writ for any, But wholly plodded how to turn the Penny. That is the Plot, which every Poet lays; Thither drives all their aim, and now a-days, Faith, 'tis the only Plot you'l find in Plays. Yet when poor Author is in greatest need, Seldom, ah! seldom does his Plot succeed. His way would be in this unlucky Age, Not to write for, but write against the Stage. The monyed men would then his Cause defend: City Security's a special Friend. They'd fit you out, for Ceylon, or Japan, Teach you to Trade, and set you up a man; Make you grow Rich;âthat's if a Poet can. What City-like Estates, might one procure at Those Golden Ports, or of Bengale, or Surat? None of our Tribe, e'er made the Voyage yet, As none of theirs Trades with our House for wit. If they were Fools enough to make the barter, How well might they deserve to lose their Charter? But Poets with the love of Courts are Curst, Which leave them Poets, as they found them first: Thought wholly for the smallest trust unfit, And reckon'd useless, for their very Wit: Whose only Wages is their homely board, What Shares, the Back-Stair Pages can afford, Or, when Fate smiles, a dinner with a Lord. The mask of madness has been often try'd, Deep Projects of desiging heads to hide, Who, as time serv'd, still threw their mask aside. Why is there of designing madness mention? Poets have still run mad thro' no intention. 'Twixt Wake, and Sleep, they live supine in slumber, On all occasions, laid aside as Lumber; No Money left,âbut Lines exceeding number.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Most Poets spread abroad an idle rumour, They never found an Audience in good humour. Our Poet, having tasted of your favour, Swears it is false, and does his best endeavour To keep you all his Friends;âAmenâfor ever. Tho' I have told him, with undaunted Spirit, It was your Goodness only, not his Merit; He Vows he knows not, (be the shame his own) Worse Poets; and a better natur'd Town; Some Criticks there may be, but those are few, Not such Fine-well-drest Gentlemen, as You: [To the side Boxes. In finding fault lies all their dear delight, And yet they read as little as they write. If e'er they write, they let no Creature know it, To the Pit, and side Boxes. But keep the Poem, and conceal the Poet, With as much pains as you would take to show it. O! that some Envoy in behalf of Wit, Would make a Truce with the tumultuous Pit: But want of Treasure is our Stages curse, And to Equip him, you must make the Purse. A Peace with Criticks, is our Houses Pray'r; Our Daughters, and our Wivesâ Our maiden Actressesâif such there are, Implore it from those unbelievers there. Which if you should deny, we must no doubt, Or shut up Shopâ Or shut our Journey-men, the Poets, out. How would it balk an Author's expectation, In these good times, to fail to please the Nation, Now that good Wine is come again in fashion? Beau's, our best Friends, we fear, will run to France, And leave us fidling here, while there they dance. Some now will say with a contracted brow, So mad an ending to a mournful showâ Yet you have laught at Tragedies e're now; And faith I think, it were not much amiss, (With our good Author's leave) to laugh at this. Ev'n Nature is her self a constant jest, And the whole World, a Stage-Play at the best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Zoilus, Usurper of Sicily. Mr. Betterton. Maherbal, his General. Mr. Verbruggen. Archias, an Old Nobleman. Mr. Arnold. WOMEN. Semanthe, Wife to Zoilus. Mrs. Barry. Cyllene, her Eldest Daughter. Mrs. Moore. Locris, the Younger Daughter, brought up in Man's Cloaths and Educated as such. Mrs. Bracegirdle. Orythia, Daughter to the Deceas'd King. Mrs. Porter. Soldiers, Men, and Women, Attendants. SCENE Sicily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE Syracuse. Enter Zoilus, Semanthe. Zo. Thus far the bounteous Gods have blest my Toyls, And crown'd my Labours with their constant Smiles. In rolling Tides my rising Fortunes flow, Bestowing all that Conquest can bestow. Rome fears our Arms, and lately felt our Pow'rs, Compell'd to fly from our Sicilian Shores. Their last Defeat secures me on the Throne, And makes this fair and fertile Isle my own. Sem. No more, my Lord, think of your Wars with Rome, Strive to secure your self from Foes at home. Your Subjects out of Fear, not Love, obey, Their down-cast Looks their Discontent betray, They wish a Change, and only wait a day. Too feeble to revolt, in Peace they dwell, Till gather'd Strength gives Courage to rebel. Zo. No, my Semanthe, Monarchy is gain'd With Pain and Toyl; but is with Ease maintain'd. Our Empires are establish'd first by Force, Then quiet Government glides on of Course. War, when no more oppos'd by War, will cease, And sink, and soften, of it self, to Peace. Full twenty peaceful Years have crown'd our Isle, And Sicily has seen no Civil Broil. Kings, in the Name of King, their Safety bear, There's something in the Sound that Subjects fear. Sem. Could you expect Protection from a Name, The slain Orontes might have hop'd the same. All Sicily his gentle Sway approv'd, As Prince, they fear'd him, and as Parent, lov'd. Till you were made by curst Ambition blind, And Lust of Pow'r debauch'd your gen'rous Mind. Thrones and Dominions glitter'd in your View, Then fell the good old Kingâ And what I grieve for most, he fell by you. Zo. Thrones and Dominions still in Prospect rise, The Neighb'ring Realms allure my dazzl'd Eyes, Nor will this one of Sicily suffice. My Fleets and Armies shall inlarge my Sway, O're-run the Continent, and plow the Sea. Sardinia, Cyprus, Corsica, and Creet, Shall lay their conquer'd Scepters at my Feet. And fast as they their Royal Crowns resign, I'll spare them from my Head to place on thine. Sem. Oh! Rather would you were some humble Swain, And I your homely Consort on the Plain. Where in a silent and serene Retreat, Our Herds might low, and Lambs around us bleat, And we lye safe from all the Storms of Fate. Forgive, my much lov'd Lord, my tender Fears, And, oh! Despise not these Prophetick Tears. Ah! when you must your Life and Empire yield, Betray'd at Home, or fighting in the Field, On whom for Succour shall your Children call, And whither shall I fly; alas! your Fall In one sad Ruine will involve us all. Zo. I still shall in my Darling Son survive, And seem in Warlike Locris still alive. His Arms your Lives and Fortunes will sustain, His Hands were made for Sceptersâ His Looks for Royalty, his Soul to reign. Sem. Oh! Never, never shall that Darling Son Possess the Realms his dreadful Father won. Poor Child! thy sad, untimely Death I fear, And now my woeful Soul foretells it near. Fate keeps it yet within her teeming Womb, Till fully ripe, it shoots with Vengeance home. His Doom, alas! is seal'd, 'tis past, 'tis gone, And you, ev'n you his Father urge it on. Remember, and you will not think I rave, The dreadful Answer which the Sybil gave, When you consulted the CumÃ¦an Cave. Your Son, the Goddess cry'dâ Unmarried, shall successful Fortune boast, But married, you, or he, or both, are lost. Zo. Can any Danger lurk around the Throne, Where Pow'r secur'd by Peace is all our own. If Heav'n will have his Life, we must resign, But still may save a Grandson of our Line. 'Tis now we must prevent the Spite of Fate, To make her harmless Malice come too late, He shall consummate with Orithia straight. At once with theirs shall Hymen's sacred Bands Joyn brave Maherball's and Cyllene's Hands. Our Subjects Acclamations ring aloud, And this Design has lull'd, and charm'd the Crowd. The sighing Virgin shall no longer stay, Nor shall he squander precious Time away, But be before-hand with his Fate to day. Sem. What Mischiefs would your fatal Rashness form? You, who should strive to lay it, raise the Storm. That Hour you destine for his Nuptial Joys, That Hour, that very Hour your Locris dyes. Locris, unhappy Locris, I deplore, And Zoilus his Race is now no more. Zo. Your Madness cease, and my Commands obey, In spight of Fate they shall be joyn'd to day. Women by Dreams to idle Fears are driv'n, And then believe the Warning sent from Heav'n. Expect from thence undoubted Aids to find, As busie Gods had nothing else to mind: They made them only at their idle Hours, To grant their Wants would beggar all their Powers. [Exit. Sem. Here will our dismal Tragedies begin, Which these unhappy Nuptials usher in; My pious Fraud must be at last reveal'd, For Locris now can lie no more conceal'd. Her Sex will be by her own self betray'd, And the deluded Bride embrace a Maid. Then, when my furious Lord shall come to know That she and I have dar'd to use him so. When he, defrauded of his Darling Son, Finds all his Hopes of Royal Offspring gone, And no Male Heir to settle on the Throne. He'll keep his solemn, execrable Oath, And wreak his Vengeance with the Death of both. Oh! Locris! born under unhappy Stars; Why hast thou scap'd the Fury of the Wars! Why thro' so many Dangers hast thou past, To come and perish in my Sight at last. Enter Locris. Lo. I met my Father follow'd by a Crowd, That sung ill-boding Songs of Triumph loud. With Joy he clasp'd me in the publick Way, And told me this must be my Nuptial Day: The Temple is prepar'd, the Bride is Drest In all the glorious Riches of the East. In vain she puts on all her useless Charms, There is no Bridegroom for her longing Arms. Fate makes her a Fantastick Fortune prove, And plagues a Virgin with a Virgins Love. Sem. Oh, Son!âMy Words will with my Wishes run, Oh! would to all the Gods you were a Son. Ah! Daughter, at thy very Birth betray'd, Destin'd to die, when thou art known a Maid. Thou yet hast been preserv'd, bred up to wield The Shining Sword, to lift the pondrous Shield, And act the fearless Hero in the Field. Heav'n has been kind, and help'd you in your part, And gave you, tho' a Maid, a Manly Heart: But how, alas! ye Gods, instruct me how Shall we continue our Impostor now? Tho' your deluded Sire should never know Your Sex; we cannot cheat Orythia so. From her strict Search the Fraud we cannot hide, Nor e're appease the disappointed Bride. Lo. Oft have I seen you tremble to relate The strange fantastick Malice of my Fate; Thro' what wild Maze I've been already led, And what yet wilder I have left to tread. My careful Sire the longing Bride prepares, And I his Daughter must beget him Heirs, What will ye do with me, ye Powers Divine! Say, is it not with Reason I repine, Since no Maid's Fate was e're perplex'd as mine. To shun my threatned Death conceal'd I lie; But always fearing Death, do more than die. Sem. Heaven in these Realms let Desolation reign, Let Fire and Sword eternal War maintain, They cannot form a more distracting Scene. Now, treacherously thy Stars deceee thy Doom; A Wife thy Bane, the Bridal Bed thy Tomb. Furies will hold the Torches round your Head, And Fate officiate there in Hymen's stead. For Joys unknown you shall resign your Life; And she no Husband have, and you no Wife: The Bride her Disappointment will perplex; But when your Father comes to know your Sex, When he shall find his mighty Projects crost, And his fair Prospect in your Manhood lost, Grief and Despight will work him to Despair, His barb'rous Hands will his own Bowels tear, No more a Father he, nor thou an Heir. Lo. Nor will our Subjects on our side engage, No pious Hand protect us from his Rage, With Joy they'll see him of his Hopes bereft, Glad that the Tyrant has no Offspring left. During his Life, they must thro' Force obey, But when at last Fate snatches that away, His House no longer shall possess the Sway. To the right Heir we must the Crown resign, For ever torn from Zoilus his Line. Sem. Oh! Curse on all Ambition, Curse on Thrones, And Curse on those rash Hands that grasp at Crowns. The Storms that now so loud around us blow, Had not been heard, had we continu'd low. Jove's Massy Bolts the Mountain's Top assail, Vast Hills are drown'd in Snow, and dash'd by Hail, The Swain enjoys a sweet and sunny Vale. Would my dread Lord had n'ere aspir'd to reign, Would the Retreat we left were ours again. Where Life's unsully'd Sweets were all our own, And we liv'd best, because we liv'd unknown. Lo. Distracted Tyranny is such a Curse, Nought but my destin'd Nuptials could be worse. Married, we live in greater Plagues and Pain, Clog'd with more Cares than Monarchs when they reign. Enjoyment sweetens some few Hours of Life, But Hours of Pleasure to an Age of Strife, They too are lost, where Maids are Man and Wife. Like Danaus his Sons I mount the Bed, Tho' justlier slain by the deluded Maid. Sem. Hark, how they shout, hark, how the Trumpets sound, While vaulted Fanes, and ecchoing Hills rebound [Trumpets sound. Gods! How their Clamours make my Brain turn round. The King and Priests in long Procession go, Little, ah! little, wretched Prince, you know That way will lead you to Eternal Woe. Hark, now again their ominous Voices rise, And now again are eccho'd from the Shies. Like Niobe, I'll go, and make my Moan, And standing on some barren Cliff alone, Grow dry with Grief, and stiffen into Stone. Manet Locris. Lo. My Spirits pant apace, my throbbing Breath Comes short, my Eye-lids seem to swim in Death. Fear, tho' a Woman, I could never know, And yet there's something makes me tremble now. In such sad Accents was my Story told, Her Eyes with such Prophetick Fury roll'd, Fate must this day some Tragedy design, And not to have it her's, I wish it mine. Ha! What is this I hear, some new Alarms. Whatever Fate decrees this Musick charms, Drums and Trumpets. For next to living is to dye in Arms. Enter Zoilus. Zo. Arm, Locris, arm, like a tempestuous Main, War in full Tides comes rolling on again. Their broad spread Sails the Roman Fleet displays, And their proud Eagles hover on our Seas. My false Sicilians with the Foe combine, All on a sudden in Rebellion joyn, And nothing now but Syracuse is mine. Dejected Hymen at the News withdrew, And murmur'd out in Sighs a sad Adieu. Mars, in his stead, comes formidably down, And aws our Island with his dreadful Frown, While his arm'd Legions compass all our Town. Lo. Here let us then, in this our last Retreat, Resist the Shock, and grapple with our Fate. True Courage in Distress is wont to soar, And we have been reduc'd as low before. To me those well-known Sounds of War are Charms, More than Love-murmurs in a Maiden's Arms. My daring Soul, the dusty Fields Delight, Beyond the Dalliance of a Bridal Night. This our last Stake against all theirs we lay, Throw boldly; if we win the dreadful Day, Their Fortunes are for ever cast away. Zo. In the mean time shall faithful Archias fly, With all his Speed to Carthage for Supply. Not far from hence their Fleet at Anchor rides; 'Twill reach us here in some revolving Tides: Till then, my Son, go seek your Tyrian Friend, On him and you my present Hopes depend. Let Blood and Battle wear their ugliest Form, By all the Gods we'll face the gathering Storm. Enter Semanthe and Women. What! Art thou here? Thou dire Presage! Thou Wife! Bane of brave Thoughts, Plague every way of Life. Thou com'st to steal away this Youth's Renown, And with thy Tears to melt his Manhood down: Like other Fools, thou wou'dst thy Offspring save, Still wish him living, tho' he lives a Slave. Sorceress, he shall to War; Avaunt, begone; Come, follow me to Arms, to Arms, my Son. [Exit. Sem. So, Tyrant, may'st thou still mistake my Sence; I'll send him thither, not detain him thence: Tho' in the Battle he may meet his Fate; My Fears are easier than they were of late. There harmless Darts may sing around his Head, But had War stay'd, till he was forc'd to wed, He must have perish'd in the Bridal Bed. Now, by my dawning Hopes, no Servile Fear Dwells in my Soul, but all is calm and clear. Sound all the Trumpets there, beat all the Drums, Not only Locris, but Semanthe comes. I'll grasp a Sword, and to the Battle fly, With Locris conquer, or with Locris dye. Follow her still, where Fame and Danger call, Share in her Triumph, or partake her Fall. Lo. My Fate has wrought me up, to let me go, With double Rage, and Vengeance on the Foe. The vanquish'd Rebels shall be tam'd again, And Romans run before me thro' the Plain: In my vast Soul I feel Ambition rise, Within my Reach immortal Honour flies, And Greatness dawns about my ravish'd Eyes. Sem. Ten thousand Gods my darling Heroine Sheild, And all the Pow'rs of Heavenâ Guard, and preserve thee in the Bloody Feild. Men ought not to condemn the marry'd Life, But leave that Task to the lost thing, a Wife. Our Husbands of themselves sufficient Curse, Load us with Children, that enslave us worse; Our Fears for them create our constant Pain, And hourly rack the restless Mother's Brain. And yet our Love encreases with our Care, We doat upon them for the Pains we Bear. Heav'en! if some suddain Vengeance you decree; Oh! see me here your Mark, show'r all on me. [Kneeling. Spare my poor Locris, when you hurl it down, And drive it on my destin'd Head alone. [Rises and Exit. Enter Maherball. Ma. War smoaks, my Friend, along the dusty Plain, And Sicily is still the Noble Scene. From Rome's Imperial Fleet whole Legions pour, While ratling Drums like high-wrought Oceans roar. Around our Shores their Ecchoing Trumpets sound, Their prancing Coursers toss their Foam around, And beat with restless Hoofs the burthen'd Ground. Bellona woes us now with all her Charms, And calls her favorite Locris forth to Arms. The Clash and Din of War your Soul delight, And you love Glory gain'd in open Fight, More than the secret Pleasures of the Night. By Heav'n, I swear, when Hymen's sacred Tye Was broke abruptly off; a suddain Joy Sprung in my Soul, and yet I knew not why. Lo. My Thoughts no other End but Fame pursue, To fight, to conquer, or to dye with you. Young as I am, I love a glorious Field, More than the Bliss my charming Bride could yeild. Thou art the Center where my Wishes joyn, My Fame, my Friendship, and my Soul is thine. Your very Sight transports me, for I see My Champion and my Genius move in thee. Ma. I love you with a Fondness far above All that was ever known in Woman's love. My FriendâOh! whither would my Transport tend? Can I say more than what I say? my Friend! Something there is beyond that very Name, Something that sets my Spirits in a Flame, I wish I were a Maid of Form divine, To make your Soul and Body ever mine. Rather I wish that you, dear Youth, could be That charming Maid to be belov'd by me. Friendship alone to wond'rous Heights may soar, The change of one of us would make it more. Lo. Those Metamorphoses, alas! are past, Could Wishes do, mine should not be the last. But from our Theme our Thoughts are wander'd far, We talk of Love, when we were bent for War. And yet your Words such tender Passion move, That I could ever talk with you of Love. Ma. Had not your Arms establish'd your Renown, Were not your vast Exploits and Valour known, By those sweet Looks, that charming Face betray'd, My sight would all my other Sence invade, And make me think you, what I wish, a Maid. Oft have I entertain'd that pleasing Thought, Till my Mistake your manly Actions taught, And spight of them destroy'd the hopes I sought. Lo. Were I that Maid, already so intire My Love is grown, it never could aspire, To a more Sacred or CÅlestial Fire. My Friendship has attain'd to that Excess, Fond as she is, my Sister loves you less. But hark, th'Embattel'd Foe prepar'd to fight, And see the Sun loth to behold the Sight, Sends out a faint and an imperfect Light. Both Armies March apace to stand, or fall; And thund'ring Shouts are the fierce Soldiers Call. Trumpets and Drums summon their Chiefs away, Who want Maherball to begin the Day. Ma. Then farewell Love, leave all those empty Joys, To longing Maids, and to deluded Boys. Believe me, Youth, who know what Women are, The Sex was never worth a Soldier's Care. Hard to be won, inconstant when obtain'd, Like new forc'd Towns, lost with more Ease than gain'd. The foolish Bridegroom makes the Nuptial Feast, But he that gives the Banquet shares the least. Safe in that State, to worst Extreams they fall, They wed but one, their Wishes are for all. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene, A City Besieg'd. Enter Zoilus, Messenger; Zoilus with a Letter in his hand Zo. Is this the Account, and this the News you bring? Has faithless Archias too betray'd his King? Fate shews her barefac'd Malice here too much, For all are Traytors now; dye thou as such. [Kills him. Bury thy Tidings with thee in thy Death, Thou should'st have made a better use of Breath. Against all Heaven and Earth, and Hell I strive, Rebellion only sicken'd to revive, The lawful Prince, ye Gods! is now alive. Where has he slept these twenty Winters past? Thought dead by all, and yet he lives at last. Here, my false Slave would sooth me to resign, And in the Prince's Name, ye Powers Divine! Presumes to pardon in an other Line; He menaces, and counsels in the next, And here, and here 'tis more and more perplext. Rot his curst Hand, avenging Thunder fall On all their Headsâ And tear, and rend them, like this Paper, all. Enter Semanthe. Sem. What sudden Rage is this, what new Despair? Why lyes, alas! that murther'd Soldier there? Look on his Fate, and learn to dread your own, For now long-suffering Heav'n begins to frown. A Thousand Meteors threaten from the Skies, On Earth a Thousand dreadful Phantoms rise. Nought of the whole Creation is at Peace, Earthquakes the Land, and Tempests toss the Seas. Broad Sheets of Flame from Ãtna's Mouth are thrown, And Cataracts of Fire fall roaring down. Thro' smoaking Plains, they burn their rapid way, And mix their boyling Surges with the Sea. A Voice in open Air is heard to roar, Tyrants and Tyranny are now no more. Zo. Let it roar on, why tell you me of Storms, Of Flaming Mountains, and Ãtherial Forms? Nor troubl'd Ocean, nor tempestuous Air, Nor burst of Thunder should a Monarch fear. Were Heav'n and Earth in wild Confusion hurl'd, Should the rash Gods unhinge the rolling World, Undaunted would I tread the tott'ring Ball, Crush'd, but unconquer'd, in the dreadful Fall. Sem. Why then was all that desp'rate Fury, why By your own Hands did this Sicilian dye? What makes your Blood afresh in Flushes rise, Why sparkles all that Vengeance in your Eyes? Zo. He told me things, Semanthe, might have made Another Soul both anxious and afraid. He talk'd of Archias, to the Rebels fled, And young Araxes risen from the dead. This wrought my Rage, but wrought at once Disdain, In vain, young Prince, you come and arm in vain, While this is in my Hand, 'tis I that reign. Sem. What dismal Scenes of Fate and Death are here; How dreadful does that Hand, those Looks appear? That fatal Sword shall find a purple Flood, And Sicily shall be the Scene of Blood. O whither shall I fly to shun the Sight? Would I were wrapt in Everlasting Night. Would I were lock'd within my silent Tomb, Or thrown in Ãtna's suffocating Womb, Unknowing of the Woesâ That threaten from behind, and crowd to come. Zo. Fly where thou wilt, fly to Araxesâdo, Act like a Wife, do thou betray me too. Fly from me with thy Train of servile Fears, Thy Conscience, thy Eternal Tongue and Tears. From my domestick Torment set me free, And send ev'n Death it self instead of thee. Sem. Thus then commanded from thy Sight I go, And leave thee to thy self, thy greatest Foe. Yet not to Rebels, nor to Rome I fly, But to those sacred Pow'rs which you defie, And at their Shrines I'll study how to dye. My Pray'rs shall hourly be to Heaven addrest, Heav'n, still our last try'd Friend, but still our best. For all my Crimes I have but once been curst, Then, then, thou Tyrant, when we marry'd first. [Exit. Zo. From thence I date my Woes, of that repent, There, Mis'ries never lessen, but augment. In vain with life-long Trouble we contend, Where Women are concern'd, it cannot end. On them we lavish our unhappy Life, The Mistress plagues us first, and then the Wife. Exit. Enter Locris alone. Lo. What an odd Fortune must I hourly prove, A Woman still prest with a Woman's Love; Narcissus like, the Love-sick Nymph betray'd, Pursues, and woes her own deceitful Shade; She Follows that in following of a Maid. She haunts me like a Ghost where-e'r I see, As I Maherball chace, she chaces me. She courts me for the Bliss I cannot grant, Seeks what I seek, and covets what I want. Her Disappointment on her Wedding-day Do's all th'impatient, longing Bride betray, Torn with Desire, and raging at Delay. Enter Orythia. Ory. Is this, is this, ye Gods! my promis'd Bliss, And am I drest in Nuptial Robes for this? Those Trumpets call you hence, my Warlike Dear, From these fond Arms, too weak to hold you here. To Wounds, to Battle, and to Death you flee, And for the Breath of Fame abandon me. Speak every Voice of War, strike ev'ry Drum, If I have any Charms, he shall not come. Thus while I clasp you in so close a Fold, You shall not let Bellona break my hold. Lo. Think not I go for want of Love away, But Honour calls me, and I must obey. Her rigid Laws now force me from your Arms, And summon me to War with fresh Alarms. New Glory in the dusty Field I'll meet, And lay new Trophies at your lovely Feet. At my return you shall new Triumphs see, New pompous Arches shall erected be, All dedicated to my Love and thee. Ory. But what if you should in the Battle fall, What then becomes of me, of Love and all? The Clash of Arms, the Cries of Men begin; Now draws the Scene of Deathâ And on all hands rush desp'rate Actors in. I see the bloody Bus'ness from afar, I see you madly spur amidst the War. Now Death appears in all its hideous Forms, And lops off lofty Heads, and lifted Arms. Sharp Spears and shivering Launces fly around, Wounds wait on Blows, and Fate on every Wound, Men's Blood and Horse's Foam besmear the Ground. Here the tall Youth lye breathless on the Plain, There fights my Locris, and bestrides the slain. Yonder agast our routed Army flies, There, weltring in his Blood, your Father lyes, And there, o'rewhelm'd with Numbers, Locris dyes. Lo. Stop those tempestuous Sighs, those silver Tears, And banish from your Breast your groundless Fears. Heav'n has not been at this Expence and Cost, To save till now, and let me now be lost! The same kind Genius all my Steps attends, Heav'n is the same, and the same Gods our Friends. And what will most your anxious Cares remove, The same my Passion is, the same my Love. Ory. Faintly methinks that Passion you express, Ev'n when you ought to show it to Excess. Lovers, when parting, should confess their Pains, And to Despair and Anguish loose the Reins. Improve their Time, and all their Flames exert, And swell their Eyes with Tears, with Sighs their Heart. But unconcern'd you seem, and look unmov'd, You look, alas! as if you never lov'd. In your calm Cheeks no strugling Blushes rise, No Love, no Passion lightens at your Eyes. No mantling Blood runs flushing thro' your Face, No murm'ring Whispers warm your cold Embrace. Nor do you with a Lover's Awe approach, Nor heave, nor pant, nor tremble at my Touch. No wish'd for Signs of fierce Desire I see, You do not, no, you do not love like me. Lo. What shall I say to make you think me true, By Heav'n, I never lov'd a Maid like you. You reign sole Mistress of my faithful Heart, No other Fair can claim the smallest Part. Go then, my Love, with this Assurance go; Leave me to meet, and overcome the Foe. Their Drums and Trumpets dare us to the Fight, And high-wav'd Swords to bloody Fields invite. The furious King chafes for his loyt'ring Son, While Shouts of rang'd Battalions urge him on, All like grip'd Thunder strugling to be gone. Go, my Orythia, and no longer pine, But one short Hour, I shall again be thine. Go somewhere, whence you may my Actions view, And bless the Sword and Arm that strike for you. Ory. Save him, kind Heav'n! some God his Guardian be, Take care, dear Youth! in your own self, of me. Give me another, and another Sight Of that dear Face in which my Eyes delight, 'Ere thou art lost in Everlasting Night. Let me embrace thee thus, thus sold thee fast, Take this last Kiss, and now another last. With Fear and Hope I stand by turns possest, That tears and rends, this lulls and sooths my Breast, And flatters my tumultuous Soul to Rest. My various Thoughts a Thousand Phantoms frame, One while the conqu'ring Foes your Fall proclaim, Then shifting Fancy shews propitious Scenes, And I'o, Locris, ecchoes through the Plains, I'o, my Locris conquers, lives and reigns. [Exit. Locris alone. Lo. Was ever Passion wrought to this Excess, And yet, ye conscious Gods! mine is not less. Her's will be cur'd as soon as I am known, But how? kind Heav'n! how shall I cure my own. I love a Man, from whom I hide my Fires, And with my Sex conceal my fond Desires. A Man, a Stranger, whom no Kindred claim, Of Parentage obscure, tho' known to Fame. Yet in his Eyes such Sparks of greatness rowl, So charming is his Mien, so vast his Soul. Such Glories in his awful Aspect shine, He cannot come from an ignoble Line. He wants a Crown, but shall Maherball want, When that, in time, will be in me to grant? He best can Guard it with his conquering Sword, And he shall be mine, and my Empire's Lord. [going. Enter Cyllene. Cyl. Turn, Brother, lost Cyllene begs you turn, For she will hold you, till you hear her mourn: You were the first occasion of my Pain, And you must help me to my Peace again. Why did you bring that Stranger to our Court? Why have the Gods ordain'd me for his Sport? He knows in what a raging Flame I burn, He knows my Love, but makes me no Return. Your Breath, your Praise first kindled up my Fire, Speak to him then, tell all my fierce Desire: So wild my Passion is, my Pain is such; Tell all that Poets feign, you cannot tell too much. Lo. What can the Gods at last by this design? Theirs is the Sport, the Plague, and Pain is mine. Methinks, in some enchanted Round we move, Lost, and bewilder'd in the Maze of Love. She begs me here to make her Passion known To the dear Youth from whom I hide my own. Your Story Sister, will become you best, [To her. Love still should be, by those in Love, confest. Of all Mankind I shall not do you right, Nor represent your Longings at their height. I could not for my self Orythia wooe, But left that part for Zoilus to do; How can you think I should prevail for you? Cyl. Already have I told him all I bore, And now if possible, I'll tell him more: I'll seize him as he mounts his foaming Horse, And with these Hands stop his impetuous Course. Spight of the Voice of War I will be heard, And e're he goes, he must my Voice regard; Nor shall he from my close Embrace be free, Nor move to Conquest, till he yields to me. Lo. Hark, I am summon'd by the embattled Foe, But take this friendly Council e're I go. Men slight the Love-sick Fool that tells her Pain, As much as Women slight the whining Swain: If you design to fix them, use them ill, Still would you have them follow, fly them still. No favour grant, comply with no request, Still put them off, if you would still be prest. What beauty Conquer'd, let your Pride maintain, To raise Desire, receive them with disdain, Bid them begone, to make them come again. Let not their sighs or Tears your pity move, Be sure you you let them not betray your Love: Your Charm is at an end, when that is found, And they for ever fly the Fairy Ground. [Exit. Manet Cyllena. Cyl. Too well, alas! the Truth of this I see; But who can be so wise, and love like me! Already has my Tongue my Pain confest, And what I once have toldâ Can never more lye buried in my Breast. I've reach'd the middle Sea to shun a Wreck; 'Tis better vent'ring thro', than sayling back. I cannot hazard more; 'tis then decreed, Spight of my first Repulse, I will proceed. Heaven! now he comes; and at his awful Sight, My raging Flames still reach a greater Height; Apace my Breath now sallies, now returns, Apace my Spirits pant, my Bosom burns, My Pride apace before my Passion flies, Wishes in Sighs, and Flames in Blushes rise, Love dawns, and darts its Rays around my dazzl'd Eyes. Enter Maherball, giving Orders to his Soldiers as he enters, which assoon as receiv'd, they retire. Ma. You to the Walls, the Ram's Assault repair, You, to your Tow'r, and take your station there. The Roman Army shews a noble Form, And marches boldly to begin the Storm. Stones, huge as Rocks, from batt'ring Engines fly, First seem to strike, then tumble from the Sky, And Men, as Thunder-struck, drop down and dye. Why, Madam, do you stand unguarded here, Where Destiny crouds on, and come so near. Why thus expos'd before your Palace-gate? Why, bare of Shelter will you brave your Fate? When Groans around of either Sex are heard, And Death's rude Hand gives Beauty no Regard. Cyll. Why should Maherball ask, who knows her Flame? Knows too the Reason why Cyllene came. I came the passing Pomp of War to view, To bid my Father, and my Friends adieu, I came to see, and take my Leave of you. Love drew me forth, which makes a Woman dare, As much as Heroes in their hottest War. No greater Harms have I to fear, who feel Worse Wounds than e're were giv'nâ By poyson'd Arrows, or by pointed Steel. Think that I feel more than I can express, And save a Virgin's Shameâ And save her Words, which make her Passion less. Ma. What shall I think; or why should you reveal Wounds which Maherball has not Power to heal? Love only is imaginary Painâ Reason and Thought will make you well again. From an ungrateful Man recall your Heart, And let your conscious Beauty take your Part. Tho' in the Pride and Bloom of Nature born, A Thousand Heavenly Charms your Face adorn, And you look lovely, as the blushing Morn. No Looks can pierce my Breast, no Charms can move, You cannot conquer, for I cannot love. Cyll. Why are you then of that CÅlestial Frame, Which sets all wondring Woman-kind on Flame. Why are your Looks and Actions so Divine, Why to your Charms must I my Soul resign, And you remain unmov'd, untouch'd by mine. Why from your Eyes should Beams of Beauty flow, To scorch my Breast, while yours is cold as Snow? Why should you not the Love you raise return, Why should you freeze, while you make others burn? Ma. Blame not me, fair Cyllene, but my Fate, That form'd me free from Passions, Love or Hate. No warm Desires ruffle my peaceful Blood, Which flows as smoothly as a Summer's Flood, Nor can I work a Tempest, if I wou'd. Nothing but War can move me with Delight, A dusty Field, and well disputed Fight Raises my ravish'd Spirits to their Height. Hark, when I hear such charming Notes as those, [Trumpets. Shrill Trumpets, ratling Drums, and shouting Foes, My Heart leaps up with Joy, my Blood around Circles, with shrilling Pleasure at the Sound, And I bound lightly o're the unbeaten Ground. Cyll. Stay but a while, till yonder Squadrons move, I'll hold you fast with all the Force of Love. They march not yet, you shall, you shall be gone, E're the first Brunt of Battle calls you on. Nay, I'll go with you too, your Steps attend, Or in my stead at least my Wishes send. Vows after Vows for your Deliverance make, And bribe all Heaven for my Maherball's sake. These Eyes shall watch you still amdst the Foe, This Heart shall follow you where're you go, And when they strike at youâ I'll stretch these Arms abroad to catch the Blow. Ma. My Soul was form'd fierce, and averse to Love, And yet bear Witness, all you Pow'rs above, How much these soft Endearments melt and move. You've made my haughty, strugling Temper fall, Lower than ever any other shall. Here stop your Conquest, where it first began, For you have conquer'd all that Woman can. Would you could drive your Passion to an end, Or would you were a Man to make a Friend. Cyll. Would I were Locris, would I could pursue, The Chace of Glory to the Goal with you. Would that these Hands the Massy Spear could wield, Would that these Legs could bear me to the Field. Would I could dart the Javelin from afar, And spur my thund'ring Courser thro' the War. Oh! would I were some wond'rous Man to do What'ere Man did, or more than Man for you. Your Harms and Hazards in your stead I'de meet, Dye with your Wounds contented at your Feet. Ma. Then should we never part, but side by side, Thro' broken Ranks in batter'd Armour ride. Urge on our foaming Horses o're the slain, And pant with noble Toyl along the Plain. Our chief Concern should for each other be, I guarding you, and you defending me. Shielding from either's Head the falling Blow, So should we live,âLocris and I live so. But since the Gods have giv'n you other Charms, Not meant for rugged War, or rough Alarms, But melting Love in some young Monarch's Arms. No longer at indulgent Heav'n repine, Nor strive against the Bliss your Stars design, Which destine you for worthier Arms than mine. Cyll. Our Sex should never be the first to wooe, The Case is diff'rent here 'twixt me and you. Has not my Father promis'd you my Bed? And ought not I to love the Man I wed? Ma. To me the Gods that Priv'ledge have deny'd, Nor dare I, till they bid, receive a Bride. Suspect not this a slight of proffer'd Love, But secret Pleasure of the Powr's above. Cyll. In vain is all those trifling Pow'rs Decree, If I must ever be depriv'd of thee. Down then the strugling Woman in my Breast, I'll forfeit Modesty to purchase Rest. My Passions drive me like the raging Wind, And Love and Pride raise Tempests in my Mind. Honour, Discretion, Reason, Sense unite, Disdain, and kindling Shame, and burning Spight Mix all at once in the tumultuous Fight. All lab'ring to prevail, oppress my Life, And undecided leave the doubtful Strife. [Swoons. Ma. Rise, wretched Princess! while I yet have Breath, To bid you rise; for I shall blush to Death. Rise, I conjure you, e're I'm forc'd to part, Ha! By the Gods, she's colder than my Heart. Who waits, Orythia, Julia, here, take Care Of this too passionate, unhappy Fair. [Enter Julia. See, she revives, I dare not longer stay, But for our mutual Ease must haste away. And now, the Trumpets sound their last Allarms, [Drums. And now, the ready Soldier starts to Arms. [Trumpets. Hark, how the Gates on brazen Hinges jar, While eager Troops bolt forward from afar, O'rerun the Plain, and plunge amidst the War. [Exit. Cyllene recovering and rising. What? Is he fled, but whither shall I flee? Oh! 'tis no Matter what becomes of me. Was I so mean to condescend to sue? And could a Woman, could a Princess wooe? What Passion mixt with what Despight I feel? Was I so slavish, tell me, did I kneel? O it was time to swoon, to burn, to bleed, To grow distracted after such a Deed. 'Twixt Love and Shame no Peace will e're be had, Till Life is worn away,â Or till my rolling Brain at last runs mad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene, The City: An Alarm. Enter Soldiers driving in Archias, Maherball following. Ma. Off, ye vile Slaves, from this ignoble strife, Dare such as you attempt a Gen'ral's Life. [Sold. Ex. Yield Archias; 'tis in vain to fight or fly, Yield to your Friend who would not see you dye. What hast thou, good old Souldier, blindly done? Why forc'd the Fate, which now thou canst not shun? How has thy Loyalty been thus misled, Why hast thou pull'd this Ruine on thy head? Arch. Rather, what hast thou done, and why, why draws The brave Maherball in so bad a Cause? I taught thy Infant-fingers first to fight, But never to maintain a Tyrant's Right. No other Father but my self you know, And will you fight against that Father now? On your own Head a double Guilt you bring, Warring against a Father and a King. Ma. 'Tis true, my other Parents are unknown, You have a Parent been; but not my own. The King I serve first rais'd me up to Power, I owe you much, but owe my Soveraign more. Nor would I for his Crown his Cause decline, But Zoilus shall reign, while this is mine. [Sword. Arch. Rash Youth still hurry headlong on their Fate, Still go too far, and still repent too late. You tread as on some Wave-beat Mountain's Neck, Ready to fall, and I would save your Wreck. But vain Young Men still laugh, when old advise, Think us the Fools, themselves alone the wise. Ma. Accuse me not of that; your Words, you know, Have been as Oracles to me till now: No more for my far distant Dangers moan, Mind not my Safety, but consult your own. Arch. Would that were all; blest should this old Man be, Were there not greater Ills in store for thee. You do not know your self, these Hands did rear, Your Childhood, brought you up to what you are. Due Filial Rev'rence to my Age you bore, You call'd me Father, for you knew no more. Would I had never knownâ Ma. Nay, speak âGo on, Speak to me as a Father, call me Son. Unload yourself of half your anxious Grief, And by dividing Woes, receive Relief. Arch. My Care at first preserv'd your Infant Breath, And since diverted oft your threaten'd Death. Thou hast not sure forgot what Charge I gave, And what Precautions I prescrib'd to save Your much lov'd Life from the relentless Grave. Ma. I know you've often warn'd me not to Wed, But shun, like Destiny, the nuptial Bed; Bid me beware the Syren Woman's Charms, But cheifly fly the fair Cyllene's Arms. Arch. Fly from her Father too, there shun your Doom, Shun him, and shun a thousand Ills to come. That way the Malice of your Stars defeat, The Secret is not ripe for telling yet. O I could mention things would make you start; Parch up your vital Blood, and tear your Heart. But 'tis not yet a time for me to dare To trust your Youth to its own self so far. Why should I mention Ills I cannot cure, And your Humanity would not endure? Ma. No, I will have them from the lowest Hell, For I dare hear what ev'n the Fiends dare tell. Not the wild Rage of a rebellious Town, Not a wrong'd Tyrant's unrelenting Frown; Not Hills of Sand blown 'ore the Lybian Plain, Nor Tempests tossing the Sicilian Main, Not tott'ring Earth from its Foundations driv'n, Nor headlong fall of the fix'd Stars of Heav'n, Not Balls of Thunder, flaming as they roll, Nor Lightning flashing fast from Pole to Pole Can shock a well resolv'd, Heroick Soul. Arch. The pointed Hour was not arriv'd before, And now 'tis past, and can be found no more. The Tyrant comes with an impetuous pace, Rage in his Motion, Vengeance in his Face: If to prolong my Life my Wish incline, 'Tis but to tell thee how to lengthen thine. Ma. I'll stand 'twixt Thee and Death, my Power is great; And I'll employ it to prolong thy date: Thus be my Natural Affection shown, Be thou my Father till I know my own. Drums, Trumpets; Enter Zoilus victorious, Locris, Soldiers. Zo. Fortune and Fate are mine, my Arms are crown'd Where er'e my Streamers wave, or Trumpets sound: No more rebellious Troops their Standards rear, No more the Roman Eagles tow'r in Air: Let to the Gods our publick Thanks be giv'n, And Incense smoak thro' all the Round of Heav'n. By Heav'n; my Rebels now shall feel my Rage, But cheifly this, had he old Nestor's Age. Speak, Venerable Traytorâtell meâsay, Where has Araxes been this dreadful day? I made his Name thro' every Squadron ring, I challeng'd him to meet and fight a King. Speak! Did he perish in the first Alarms? Or does he live, and durst not meet my Arms? Arch. Long may he live; and all his Foes survive; I left him last unwounded, and alive. Not but he fought, thro' the whole Battle ran, Mov'd like a God, performing more than Man. Your bravest Men of War declin'd the Strife, And no Sicilian durst attempt his Life. Zo. Dar'st thou speak this, old Detardâ Arch. King, I dareâ I'm now so old Life was not worth my care, Whether I perish'd in the fierce Dispute, Fell by your rage, or dropt like ripen'd fruit. Zo. Yet I'll be calm, for I have power at last, To punish, after all my Questions past: Where is your Prince? all that you know reveal, Tell your whole Plot, not the least part conceal; The Secret of your sudden Flight unfold, 'Tis a King asks; a King that will be told. Arch. Let me be dumb for ever; let the Tomb Gape wide, swallow me quick, and keep me dumb. Lest Whips, Racks, Dungeons, Tortures should prevail, And broke with Torments feeble Nature fail. Zo. Away with him to Racks, and let him feel The burning Pinchers and the bearded Steel. While in a lingring Agony he lyes, Long wishing for his Death before he dyes. Ma. Pronounce not, Royal Sir, so rash a Doom, There's no recalling Secrets from the Tomb. His would be buried with him, if he fell, And you would put him past the Pow'r to tell. You know him obstinate, perverse, and old, Mild ways must win him, leave him me to mould. When Kings of Rebels, and Rebellions hear, Showing their Fury, they betray their Fear. For your own Safety then, defer his Fate, 'Tis rumour'd he can save, or sink the State; Wise Princes will prolong a Traytor's Breath, For their own Use, and then pronounce his Death. Zo. Then be it as you will, my faithful Friend, My Crown your Arms, and your Advice defend. But bear him to the Dungeon, there secure [Arch. is led off. His Legs, Hands, Arms, fast fetter'd to the Floor. How shall I recompense what thou hast done, This day wears fast, and the Sun's Course is run, Next day shall see you equal with my Son. When Locris, and Orythia's Hands shall joyn, I'll give my lov'd Cyllene's into thine. Let victory be now the gen'ral Cry, Beat Drums, sound Trumpets, let your Banners fly, And with expanded Streamers sweep the Sky. Sound while your Emp'rour is triumphant led, Sound while his Son ascends the Genial Bed. [Ex. cum Sold. Manet Maherball, Locris. Ma. Revive, ye dying sounds of distant War, Roll with recover'd fury from afar. Strike louder than before the thund'ring Drum, More Romans, more Sicilian Rebels come. In Fields the Godlike Heroe gains his Fame, While neighb'ring Nations tremble at his Name. No Feild is now for any Martial Deed, But drowsy Peace, and droning Wives succeed. Lo. What can the Fates design, my noble Friend, And where will all these threatning Mischeifs end? My desp'rate Father knows when e'er I Wed, Unerring Oracles have doom'd me Dead. Yet his Commands are for my Nuptials given, In spight of Oracles, In spight of every Ordinance of Heaven. Ma. The same was told me by my Father's Ghost, That when I marry'd, I was surely lost. Thrice his shrill Voice denounc'd my doom aloud, And thrice he call'd me Son, and thrice I bow'd. Tho' void of Fear, to Wars, and Dangers bred, Yet such a Message from the mighty Dead Deters me from the Fair Cyllene's Bed. Lo. Saw you the Shape the Ghost assum'd before; What aspect, and what form, or port he bore? Mark'd you the Featuresâ Ma. That, alas! I can Give no account of; Pale he look'd, and Wan, The Shade retaining little of the Man. Lo. None but Cyllene? did the rev'rend Shade Name none besides, except no other Maid? Ma. None elseâ Lo. 'Twas strange. Ma. And strangely has it wrought, And still revolves within my labouring Thought; I'll to the King, and beg him to suspend Our threatned Nuptials, till the War shall end. Ev'n that may gain us time, and we may find Some way unthought of yet to change his Mind. If granted not, I'll leave him to his Crown, And fly to foreign Camps to win Renown. He tyrannizes most o're human Life, Who would, against our Will, impose a Wife. [Exit. Manet Locris. Lo. Thou shal't not noble Youth, go hence alone, I'll share thy Exile, till thou shar'st my Throne. I'll follow thee, thou Charmer of my Soul, Where ever Tempests beat, or Billows roll. Thro' foaming Seas, and scorching Sands I'll flee, And leave my Parents, and my Crown for thee. Enter Semanthe. Sem. And art thou found again, but do I boast Of finding thee, who must so soon be lost? Fate, like the Sword, hangs threat'ning o're our Head, Held only by a single, slender Thread, Which, when that breaks, will fall, and strike us dead. The furious King with his drawn Sword I see, Now he kills Locris, now he murthers me. Now down the Shore he drags us side by side, And throws our mangled Bodies to the Tide. Lo. Would I had never been, to cause your pain, But yet be calm, take courage once again. The Gods that have by their almighty Aid, Amidst fierce Wars preserv'd a feeble Maid, Will not permit me now to be betray'd. Sem. Why was Bellona's work so quickly done? Why are the Trumpets Clangors hush'd so soon? Rush to new Wars, new shouting Squadrons Head, Or fightâor flyâ Do any thing to shun the Nuptial Bed. How gladly could I here my Life resign? But oh! Your Miseries would not end with mine. Gods! 'Tis too much to bear; Slaves bound in Chains, Broke upon Wheels, and rack'd with mortal Pains, Feel not my Woes, but with more ease expire, Let me go mad, or give me back my Peace. O cruel Husband! O unnatural Sire! O wretched Child! O most unhappy Race! O miserable me! [Falls. Lo. Rise, and I'll fall, I'll perish for us both, I'll bear it all. Fate cannot such a just Request deny, For you who gave me Life I ought to dye. Sem. Thou: thou hast been midst desp'rate Dangers taught, From Infancy to value Death at naught. But I, my Child, in these declining years, Bend with my feeble Age, and feebler Fears. Lo. Then let my Youth your feeble Age sustain, Trust to my strength, you shall not trust in vain. Around my Trunk, like fearful Ivy twine; Yours be the Safety, as the Duty's mine. The Gods will then prevent the threatned Stroke; Their Thunder dares not rend their Sacred Oak, Sem. There are no pitying Gods; or, if there are, Nor you, nor I have ever been their Care. I'll act a Bacchanal, and scour the Plain, Feign madnessâthat, alas! I need not feign. O're Hills and Dales with desp'rate Fury fly, Make distant Woods restore my frantick Cry, Meet from wild Beasts a less unnatural Doom, Or in the Forest dig our quiet Tomb. Lo. So frantickly, alas! you look, and speak, I feel my stubborn Heart begin to break: Custom has given me Courage, which secures My Soul from Fears, yet still I fear for yours. Sem. Then I'll be silent, thou no more shall't know, Alas! I've let thee know too much of Woe. But henceforth to my self my griefs shall be, Whate'er I feel, I'll hide it all from thee. Lo. Rather speak on, speak on, and let us share Suffrings alikeâam I too weak to bear? Silence, alas! would be too sure a Sign Of desp'rate Grief; one part at least be mine. Yet do not, do not give it such a Scope, Trust on the Gods; there still is room for hope. Sem. Who talks of hope, what flatt'ring Tongue presumes To bid me hope? Can that be found in Tombs? Let Hope from this unhappy Climate fly, For who can hope, that sees my Locris dye? No more the voice of Comfort let me hear, Speak notâ Or if you speak, speak nothing but Despair. Look yonder, where the Winds and Waves engage, Hark, how they roar, behold them how they rage! Survey this troubled Earth, that thundring Sky, What cause have they to storm, what not have I? Stand off, and give me leisure to complain, And thinkâO no,âno, never think again: Stand off, and give me way, 'tis mine to rave, Driv'n by each Wind, and dash'd by every Wave; What art can succour us, what pow'r can save? [Exit, supported by Locris. Enter Cyllene. Cyl. I heard Despair pronounc'd, and fain would see That wretched Creature who dspairs like me. Whoe'er thou art, worse Ills thou can'st not prove, For my Despair is the Despair of Love. O Fool, abandon'd Fool! to stoop so low, So to pursue the Man who slights you so. Sure it is thus by some Divine Decree, Speak Heavenâwhy ask I you who mind not me, I'll answer to my selfâ Fate's hand is in it, or it could not be. Enter Maherball Ma. Where's Locris? haâ [aside. Cyl. Now hold my beating Heart: What makes thee blush, what caus'd that guilty Start? Am I so monstrous? can my Gorgon sight Put so renown'd a Champion in a Fright? Since our near Nuptials are the Stars Design, Thou should'st have nam'd no other Name than mine. Ma. What am I doom'd to bear? Cyl. What have you born? 'Tis I, fond fool bear all; your Salvage Scorn: Or worse then Scorn; Indifference! cruel Fate! Let him but shew me either Love or Hate. Is that so hard to grant? Ma. For Heavens sake, cease, And give your self, and give Maherball Peace. You wrong me, and in your impetuous Rage Blame me for Pains, which I must ne'er asswage. Cyl. You wrong me more, you wrong my Father's Crown, Who nobly rais'd thee from a Wretch unknown. Brave, gen'rous Proofs of Gratitude you bring, But still 'tis thus with a too gracious King: Should he now know how you disdain my Bed, Instead of giving me, he'd take your Head. Ma. The King thinks better since. Cyl. 'Tis thou hast taught; 'Tis thou, ingrateful, hast inspir'd the Thought: Brave as thou art, thou may'st be yet afraid Of the Revenge of a rejected Maid. Fly to some dismal Cave, or dreadful Den; Herd with your Fellow-Brutes, and not with Men. Go, stupid Wretch! whom Beauty cannot move, Thou art not bless'd with Soul enough to love. Ma. Humbly I take my leave. Cyl. Hold yet, and stay; O Heav'n! What have I done? What can I say? Hell! how he catch'd the word to haste away! I call'd thee back but to pronounce thy Fate, To show my Rage can like my Wrongs be great. When Love is fled, Revenge supplies his room; Dread then a certain and a sudden Doom. Know, from this time, ingrateful Wretch! I tear Thy Image from my Heartâ Or if that will not be, I'll stab thee there. [Ex. severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Locris, follow'd by Orythia. Ory. Do I again my Love in Safety see? Welcome from War, and welcome home to me. Now beats my Heart no longer: Did I say No longer? No, till the next dreadful Day. For tho' Defiance is at distance breath'd, Yet still the bloody Sword remains unsheath'd. Lo. Therefore, while yet yon hostile Legions move, It is not time to talk, or think of Love. Prevailing Foes may our Delights destroy, And sunder Lovers in the midst of Joy. When Victory is made compleat and sure, Then Love be crown'd when Conquest is secure. Ory. O make not such a faint and weak Excuse, A flat Denial were a less Abuse: I know my Failing is I want a Crown, Which was my Father's once tho' now your own. His Loving Subjects uncompell'd obey'd; In Quiet he the glittering Scepter sway'd. How little should all human Goods be priz'd, He's dead, and I, unhappier I, despiz'd. Lo. Least you should think me guilty of Disdain, Know, that I too was never born to Reign. You cannot yet the Gods Designs discern, Which only I have been allow'd to learn. Ory. You talk in Clouds, speak Locris, ah! speak plain, What do the Gods, or what do's Locris mean? You think that I for base Ambition wooe, But my Ambition centers all in you. My Father's death for you I can forgive, And for you only I desire to live. Some recompense is to my Sufferings due, Who suffers for you, and forgives you too. Lo. I merit no Maid's Love to this excess, Nor can repay you, were your Passion less. I mourn like you, your good old Father's fate, Would mine had by some other means been great. I have no Love to give; but could resign The Crown with ease, and once more make it thine. Ory. Look down, Orontes, from thy Native Sky, And see thy lost, despairing Daughter dye. Yes, Locris, yes, to death, to death I go, Yet dying, bless that hand which gave the blow. Daggers and Wounds before my Eyes I see, Fire, Poison, Swordâ But still I will divert them all from thee. O Brother! when Sicilian Squadrons yield, Spare Locris, spare him in the bloody field. O Father! plead with all the Powers above, Not to revenge thee on the Man I Love. [Exit. Locris alone. Lo. Unhappy Maid, thy Fortune I deplore, Tho' mine ought justly to be pitty'd more. Your Woes will end, nor can you long lament, But I must dread a sad, and dire Event. Yet shall this Thought instruct me how to bear, Fearing, is worse; than Suffering, what we fear. Enter Maherbal. Ma. Your Father is resolv'd, I met him late, With Looks that threatn'd nothing less than Fate. At my Approach his Rage began to rise, And Vengeance lighten'd from his glaring Eyes. As I past by, I bow'd, no Word he said, But frown'd, as if he could have look'd me dead. When I spoke to him first, his fierce Reply Was, that we might not Wed, but then must dye. Lo. Dye I'm resolv'd; why, it were death to Wed; Alike with Death I Love Orythia's Bed. Let him be both a King and Father still, No King, no God can force their Creature's Will. From our Creation that is left us free, And I will use it, as it ought to be. Ma. More than what yet is said, he menac'd too, Ev'n tho' his only Son, he menac'd you. Rage choak'd his words at last, and then a Gloom Silently warn'd me to depart the Room. Your Sister just retir'd, as I came in, Thence Springs his Passion, there our woes begin. Orythia's with him now, but all in Tears, And not with such a Look as Vengeance wears. His Eyes pursu'd me as to you I came, And mark'd my Steps that he might take the same. Enter Zoilus leading in Orythia weeping. To what a glorious purpose have I Reign'd, To see my Kindred, and my Blood disdain'd? You shall, you shall my just Resentments know; Yes, Son; yes, Traytor; not my General now. Ma. How! Traytor? Zo. Dare you then the Name deny, When a King speaks, dare you, his Slave, reply? Go poor Unknown, abandon'd, and forlorn, Go, if thou canst, where thou at first wer't Born. Thy wretched life, out of revenge I grant, And banish thee to live in scorn, and want. Ma. Cease threatning him, that is not to be brav'd, Born with a Soul which scorns to be enslav'd. I was not born thy Subjectâ Lo. O be goneâ Pull not inevitable ruine on. I'll follow youâ [aside. Ma. No let them fly, who fear The frown of ought on Earth; I'll tarry here. Is this my recompence for all I've done, For all thy Glory in my Battles won? I gave no Crown, created thee no Prince, But still this Sword sustain'd your Empire since. By my past Services too great I grow, And therefore Dungeons must reward them now. Zo. I wou'd have made you greater, you refus'd, A King's Allyance, and his Love abus'd. Nay, answer not, that aggravates th'offence, Hence from my sight, or I shall spurn you hence. Ma. Speak not, and look not, and advance not so, Make not the smallest offer of a blow. Zo. Then from this Hand and Sword your fate receive A Death too glorious for so vile a Slave. Lo. Spare, spare my Father. [Ma. disarms him without drawing. Ory. Spare the King. Ma. I know What I should do; where's Pow'r, where's Empire now? All in this HandâWhy mount I not the Throne? What hinders me from making all my own? But thus this Traytor gives you back your Sword, And still confesses you his Soveraign Lord. Zo. This Artifice shan't serve; my Guardsâwho wait? [Guards surround and seize him. Go, bear this Rebel Traytor to his Fate. Loaden with Chains in Dungeons let him lye, Till I contrive, and doom him how to dye. Ma. Now is the Lyon taken in the Toyl, And yet the timerous Hunters dare not smile. But with a Dread their captive Foe survey, And tho' secure, stand trembling o're their Prey. Zo. Go then, and bind the Lyon in the Den, And see if he can make us tremble then. Loc. O Sacred Sir, O Father! Zo. Ha! Have done, Plead for thy self, not him, rebllious Son. Go, see my Will perform'dâ Ma. is led off. Ex. Zo. Ory. Manet Locris. Oh! then adeiu To all that's great on Earth, dear Youth in you. The lovely Cause for ever must remove, But I for ever feel the Rage of Love. Yet if his Death is not the fixt Decree Of all the Fates, still some Relief may be, Some means found out to save and rescue thee. Enter Cyllene. Cyll. Where have they sent him, whither is he hurl'd? Driv'n to the Dungeon, driv'n from the World. Tell, Brother, tell me, whither is he led; O speak, in Chains, in Banishment, or Dead? Lo. Kind Heav'n! she comes to my own Heart's content, [aside. Whate're he suffers; thou, canst thou relent? Dost thou bemoan him, thou, whose fatal Breath Denounc'd his Doom, and sentenc'd him to Death. Cyll. Death, didst thou say? his Death? if he must fall, Finall Destruction seize on us and all. The mad Effects of Women's Passion see, How they can Love and Hate at once in me. Lo. If you would save him, stay to mourn no more, Mankind may perish in a Day, an Hour. Our Fathers Signet lyes in your Command, He Signs his Warrants with Cyllene's Hand. Cyl. Here, take the Signet then, and set him free; Flee as a Brother, as a Lover flee. To your own Conduct I the rest resign, Tell him the Act was eitherâyours,âor mine. [Exit. Lo. Thy blindness in thy Love my hopes secures, I'll flee, but not to make the Glory yours. If such a little Fraud should seem unjust, To gain their Love, who would not break their Trust? [Exit. Scene Changes to a Dungeon; Maherball, Archias in Chains. Arch. With what a sad Confusion in my Face Do I behold thee in this Patal Place? You were the only one I wish'd to see, But not to see you thus, thus chain'd like me. At the first Glimpse, the first surprizing View, I hop'd it was Delusion all, not you. Ma. All is Delusion in this Mortal Life, Ev'n our own Sense is with it self at Strife. Toss'd here, and there, by the Decrees of Heav'n, Our selves not knowing why, or whither driv'n. There's this advantage still, I now may know My Parents; what will that avail me now? Arch. Only heap Woes on Woes, bring no Releif, But fresh Additions to your former Grief. Did I but see you circled with a Crown, Or at an Army's Head to seize your own. Then it were time to tell, till then to keep The Secret in, and let your Father sleep. Ma. Did you name Crowns, or am I grown your Scorn? Yet something tells me I was Princely born. Oh! Speak, say in what part of all the Earth My Parents had their Crown, and I my Birth? Arch. Seek, seek to know no more, for Heav'n's sake, cease, Keep (while you have) the least Remains of Peace. Ma. Tell me the worst, tell, where he liv'd, and dy'd, Where reign'd he, and a thousand things beside. Would I were free to roam, to search, enquire Maherball's Kingdoms, and Maherball's Sire. To the last Limits of the World I'd fly, Till Strangers tell what unkind you deny. Speak, or you love me not.â Arch. I love too well,â Ye Conscious Gods too much I love to tell. Ma. Longer I find it is in vain to wait, Nor will I tarry for a Traytor's Fate. My death I can accomplish with my Chains, And dash the Prison Walls with bloody Stains. Arch. Hold, sacred Sir, and you, alas! shall know; Yes, you shall learn it to your Mortal Woe, And have that fatal Comfort, e'er your go. Oh! for this knowledge, Prince, you need not roam, 'Tis to be learnt, 'tis to be had at home. Let me take Respit, let me take my Breath, And pause a while, before I give you Death. Ma. Be quick, and let thy Tongue be loose and free, Thy Words may choak thy self, but kill not me. Arch. You told me once you saw your Father's Shade, But know not who he wasâ Alas! you knew him not alive or dead. Dare you the bounds which I prescribe maintain, And see that awful Spirit once again? Ma. See him, speak to him, ask him how, and who Perform'd the dreadful Deed; I dare pursue Their Lives to death; their spotted Souls to Hell, There torture those by whom my Father fell. Archias unrolling the King's Picture, Orontes King of Sicily, writ in large Letters under it. Arch. Letters, and Seals, and Rings might be of use, But I can more substantial Proofs produce. This I preserv'd intire from Vulgar Rage, From Fire, and Water, and devouring Age. 'Twas taken after Death. Ma. Oh! Heav'n! was this My Father's Semblance? Was this Picture his? Now by my Wrongs the very same I saw, It strikes me with a strange, unusual Awe. Tell me, most Sacred Shade, am I thy Son? Speak to meâbut, alas! thy Speech is gone: Those Wounds say something, for Revenge they gape, No, the curst Author of them shall not scape. Tell meâthis cannot tell. [to Arch. Arch. 'Tis vain to know, He wears a Crown, who gave the fatal Blow. Vast are his Troops, and num'rous Guards surround His Throne, and keep aloof the threatned Wound. Ma. And I am bound, ye Gods! and I am bound, Or what if Millions did his Throne surround? Who was that King? Arch. He who has now the Sway, And governs Sicily this present Day. Ma. Oh Heav'n!âHeav'n there had nought to do. O Hell! Speak thou no more, the rest let Furies tell. Was it by his curst Hands my Father Fell? That King? whom I but now so blindly spar'd, Whom I disarm'd in view of all his Guard? Who to provoke my Fury, call'd me Slave, And sent me hither for the Life I gave. How did I scape when young?â Arch. I sav'd you, Prince, Till now, curst now; I have secur'd you since. Ma. Would I had perish'd then, or rather now, Would I might live to strike one glorious Blow. Revenge, Revenge; alas! it will not be; Revenge has Bolts, which weigh her down like me. Dash then thy galling Fetters on the Ground, Thy Mother-Earth with thy sharp Irons wound. Spurn with thy Shackles her unhappy Womb, Tear up her Entrails, till thou findst a Tomb; Rattle your Chains at yon relentless Sky, Curse thy malignant Stars, run mad, and die. Arch. Raise from the Ground, dread Sir, your Sacred Head, Earth is not fitting for Prince's Bed. Dare Fate, like Heroes born of Royal Blood, Fall as Maherball and Araxes should. Ma. 'Tis for Revenge I grovel here, and groan; I mourn my Father's Fate, and not my own. Mourn, that I cannot hurl this Murth'rer down To Sulph'rous Lakes, ten thousand Fathom down. Arch. Yet still be calm, and let not Fortune boast; Your Godlike Temper, when she frown'd, was lost. Ma. There is a time, when Nature seems at Peace, And all the Jars in the Creation cease. When Winds and Waves are hush'd, and heard no more, And those forbear to rage, and these to roar. There is a time, when Clowds disperse and fly, No more engendring Thunder in the Sky. A time when Wars no more the World molest; All with a deep, sweet Calm supinely blest; But we are never with our selves at rest. This is the State ev'n of the happiest Men; Then, cruel Gods! Oh! what must mine be then? Arch. Hark, the Doors open, and the Traytor's come. Heav'n! can you suffer so unjust a Doom? Yet, let the Fates decree what-e'er they will, Conceal Araxes, be Maherball still. Ma. Yet will I not die tame, but perish warm; My Hands, instead of Swords, my Bolts shall arm: And tho' I fall in an ignoble Throng, I will make sure to have one Slave along. Enter Locris and Governour of the Prison. Lo. Be quicker; burst asunder all the Doors, This Signet here all I command secures. In what a Posture does my Hero stand? How better would a Sword become his Hand? Quick, knock his Shackles off, and then retreat, And, on your Life, where I appointed wait. [Gov. knocks off his Bolts, and Exit. Ma. Sure, 'tis enchantment all, this Story told, Would make it look like a Romance of old. Lost in amazement, and confusion too, I know not how to give what thanks are due: My want of Power to pay my Debt I mourn, But when 'tis mine, I'll make a full return. Lo. Stay not to thank me, but make hast, and fly: Fly, till Night comes, to some close Thicket nigh. Why are you so dismay'd? so pale? so dumb? Look so upon me? come, I'll guide you, come. Hast, if you wish your self, or me to live; If we are caught, the King will ne're forgive. Ma. Hold yet, for here your Favours must not end, I cannot move till you release my Friend. I owe him for a Life, nor shall he be Left in those Fetters there, while I am Free. Lo. Help to unbind him then; now all away; Fate hovers o'er, and has us, if we stay: He thinks that Fortune leads him; but I prove [aside. That I am led, and only led by Love. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE a Grove. Enter Cyllene alone. Descending Night the neighb'ring Valleys fills, And presses on the brows of bending Hills. Our Fear around us with the darkness flows, And Mankind flies to Shelter and repose. Love Conquers fear, with a regardless Eye, I view the Gloomy Shades, and pass them by. Thro' dismal Caverns unconcern'd I rove, And tread with Dauntless steps the Desart Grove; Driv'n by Despair, and goaded on by Love. All sleepy nature is to Silence bent, But my Tumultuous Sorrows will have vent. Winds, on your Wings my Mournful accents bear, Sound, Echo, thro' the Woods, Despair, Despair. Bring my Maherbal to me; hark, around Sad Echoes answer from the hallow Ground, He will not come where I am to be found. Fan me, cool Gales; Lull me, sweet Aires to Rest, Flow o'er me some kind Stream, And quench this Burning Fever in my Breast. Snatch me, some Whirlwind, on a sudden up, And bear me to the bleakest Mountains top. Let Rain, and Hail, and headlong Winter fall: Gods! show'r down all your Floods, I want them all. The Wind around in grateful murmurs Blows, [Goes into the Grove. The Rain beats fast, and yet my Fever grows, I'll on, and lose at once, my Self, and Woes. Enter Locris alone. Loc. What Wonders have I heard, ye Pow'rs Divine! Is he I Love Araxes?â Ah! since he is, he never can be mine. Now, shall we Fall by his prevailing Pow'rs, Or he (as hard a Fate) must Die by ours. By me our Houses mortal Foe was Freed, By me, who cannot yet repent the Deed. Wistly he Look'd, and full of Lab'ring Thought, Loth to receive the Liberty I brought. Great Spirits, still with Blushes, take a grant, Disdaining chiefly, what they chiefly want. His Struggling yet was more; he Scornd to owe Ought to his Rival, whom he thought his Foe; But Locris is not known while he thinks so. Maherbal, no; I all to thee Resign; My Crown, my Empire, and my Heart are Thine. I'll on, and find thee, if thou can'st be found, Make, till thou hear'st, the circling Woods resound. Speak, conscious Forests, Speak some vocal Tree, Some Sylvan tell, where can Maherbal be? A thousand Thoughts within my Breast revolve; Something I'll do, but cannot yet resolve. Break thro' these Shades, Maherbal, and appear: Maherbal, Answer, if you live, and hear. Ma. Who's there? who calls? [rising from the root of a mossy Tree. Lo. One who was forc'd to rove, And search thee long in vain, thro' all the Grove. Why gaze you thus, with such A wild affright? Why glare your Eyes amidst the gloomy night? Whence all those signs of Mingled rage and woe, Why that Stern look, and that contracted Brow? Ma. Leave me, I charge you, leave me here to die, By our past Friendship, I conjure you, fly. Lo. What said you? did you speak of Friendship past? Could not repeated Favours make it last? Ma. Seek not to tear a Secret from my Breast, Which known, will rob you of Eternal Rest. Ask not the reason, but with Speed retire, Least I should set thee with the World on fire. Lo. Let guilty Men seek Safety by retreat, Those that are Innocent may brave their Fate. I saw you mourn, and came to claim my part, And share whatever should oppress your Heart. Ma. Thou art my chief Oppression; now be gon, Ere thou, like mine, pull'st thy own ruine on. Thine is the Guilt, curse on thy Traitor's Face, For thou hast struck me in the tendrest place. Lo. Would Heav'n I had, all would be then Secure, [Aside Nor He, nor I our present Pangs endure. Know, that I Scorn a title so Unjust, [to him. Who never in the least betray'd my Trust. Where, how, and when was I so? Ma. Perjur'd Friend; Away, betimes, here let thy Questions end. Know thou hast wrong'd my Honour, now deplore We once were Friends, but must be so no more. Lo. To raise thy Honour has been all my Aim, More than my own, to spread abroad thy Fame, Give thee, ingrateful! an Immortal name. Once more I charge you, as you were a Friend, Declare your Wrongs, what'er event attend. Speak, under shelter of the Secret Night, If you are wrong'd, my Sword shall do you right. Ma. [Drawing] Thou'st found a way, I take thee at thy word, Nought else could have prevail'dâ Nought but the Manly offer of thy Sword. Now if thou dar'st, a strict attention give, In me behold the lost Araxes live. My Father fell by thine, he Seiz'd his Throne. Can after that, his Son and I be one? Now Draw, the Night clears up, the Silver Moon Shines bright, our business will be ended soon. Heaven seems at last to favour my design, Revenge and Empire shall at once be mine. Lo. Hold, I'm no Son to Zoilusâ Ma. Ha! take care, Play not with me, fond, Foolish Youth, beware. Lo. Think me his Son, yet am I free from Guilt, Clear of all Blood by Fraud, or Fury Spilt. In my behalf this may Securely plead, I was not Born some Years, when he was Dead. Ma. Let that Speak for you then, and now be gone, Leave me to take Revenge on him alone. Let so much be to our past Friendship due, At once to Pity, and to Pardon you. Lo. Pardon your self, if you, in Justice, can, For your Ingratitude, perfidious Man! Did not I save your Life, last dreadful Feild? Throwing before your Breast by batter'd Shield? Leaving my Bosom naked to the Foe, Did not your now scorn'd Friend preserve you so? Ma. Are not you well rewarded with a Crown? A recompence for greater Actions done. Say, have not I more oft preserv'd your Life? And Sheilded you in a more dang'rous strife? Some pow'r you give, some strifling Posts resign; You pay me part of what should all be Mine. Not high enough to Guard my self by Force, But high enough to make my Downfal worse. A gracious look, and flatt'ring Smile they show, Who would make Surest when they strike the blow. Snakes may securely lurk beneath the flow'rs, But when they find their Foes within their pow'rs, Springing, they spurn their coverts from the ground, Leap at their Prey, with hisses as they bound. Lo. Can in that Breast such idle fancies grow? We still were Friends, and we may still be so. Ma. A Crown divides usâ Lo. Here our diff'rence ends, Divide the Crown; that should not sep'rate Friends. Ma. Crowns will admit no Rivals, I'll resign Not the least Jewel that enriches mine: But I may lose it by my Foolish stay, I talk, and trifle, all my time away. Lo. Now by my fame in Arms, you shall not go, Duty commands detain my Father's foe. If nothing can a bar sufficient be, To stop your passage, you shall pass thro' me. Ma. Go, stop the raging Fire, or rolling Sea, Stop tumbling Torrents in their headlong way. Stop Light'ning as it flashes thro' the Skies, And stop Jove's massy Thunder, as it flies. When such Stupendous things as those are done, Then think of hind'ring me from going on. Lo. Poor man with Frenzy, and Ambition lost, I pity, and despise so vain a boast. Were thy redoubted Sword the Thund'rer's brand, Know, I could wrest it from thy trembling Hand. Ma. Tempt not my rising Fury to destroy, My very Arms would blush to kill a Boy. Be gone, and force me not against my will, Be gone, while I can keep my Temper still. Or let me goâ Lo. Stay, that the Boy may try Whom Fate decrees to Conquer, whom to Die. Beware, and do not slight my tender Age, I dare your Valour, and defy your Rage. Manhood that thinks, is apt to harbour Fears, Courage is oftner found in Younger years. Ma. Hold yet my hands, you lately set me Free, And gratitude forbids me Fight with Thee. Lo. Lay all those Trivial poor excuses by, Know, 'twas Cyllene Set you Free, not I. Ma. Farewel Compassion, then farewel remorse, Pity is fled, and Rage will have its course. [Both Drawing. Now dread the Vengeance rumbling o'er thy head, Ready with bursting Clowds to dash thee dead. Lo. Ready for Fury which I cannot fear, She loosens her robe a little, her Helmet drops off, and her Hair appears. Here's my bare Breast, now if thou dar'st, strike here. Ma. O all ye Gods! what Wonders do I See! What had I like to have done?â How am I Sav'd in not Destroying thee. All that within my boundless wish could fall, Was thisâO bounteous Powers! and have I all? Thus low, thou dear Triumphant Fair, I bow, I own to Heaven, and Earth, I'm vanquish'd now. Thus let me from your Lips my Sentence meet, Or Seal my Pardon e're I leave your Feet. Lo. Rise, and no longer on the ground recline, Rise to these Arms, this Heart for ever thine. I wrought your rage, high as I could to see That if (when known) I might forgiven be, And then concluded you could Love like me. Ma. If transport leaves me strength enough I'll rise To thee the Fountain, and the flood of Joys. Divinely Charming, and Divinely good, Thou wert not guilty of my Father's blood. O! for thy sake I could, I doubt, forgive His woeful Fate, and let thy Father live. But if the Gods his Punishment design, Grant he may fall by other Hands than mine. Lo. Our Fates to thee, as to a God we trust, Mild amidst Wrongs, more Merciful than Just, My being known, this my Assurance moves, Maherbal was my Friend, Araxes loves. Maherbal holding, and Gazing on her. O stand a little off, and let me gaze, For all my Sense is swallow'd in a maze. Art thou a Woman then? O blest surprize! O dawn of op'ning Heav'n! O Heav'n of Joys! Woman! the Tongue to show her tuneful skill, Must utter nought but WomanâWoman still. Invoking you, our tow'ring Souls we raise, You work our Passions, but transcend our Praise. The Gods for your Creation we adore; But still we Worship you their Creatures more. At Shrines we seemingly present our Pray'rs, Yours are our off'rings, Heav'n! our hearts are theirs. From them the Soldier all his Courage draws, Sure of Success, where Woman is the cause. When Ravish'd Poets write, or Prophets dream, Woman is still the dear Transporting theam. Their blood if fir'd their Fancies are Divine, They feel a Fury, and a Flame like mine. Lo. Here all the Warfare of my life is o'er, And I must play the Man's great part no more. Farewel my golden Crest, and glitt'ring Sword, Go, seek my much lov'd Arms, some other Lord. Farewel the Silver Trumpets Charming strains, Farewel the Drums that Thunder o'er the Plains. Farewel the Troops that threaten from afar, Farewel the waving Streamers of the War. Farewel the bloody Spears, and batter'd Shields, Ye long disputed Fights, and dusty Fields, Farewel the Fame that dear bought Conquest yields. Farewel the Tempest-beaten Troops that dwell Whole winters in your stormy CampsâFarewel. Ma. Hear me, My Locris, take my Farewel too, Ye sevenfold Sheilds, and shiv'ring Spears adieu, Farewel to Warâto all the Worldâbut you. I'll clasp you close, and fold you ever thus, I'll crush you to my Heartâ And none shall ever Love and Live like us. Why were you thus Disguis'd? O tell me howâ But holdâ'tis not an hour for Questions now. We'll wast no time that's lent us to improve; Our Life is all too little for our Love. I'm lost betwixt my wonder and delight, Let's hasten, and Secure the Charming night, When the mute Soul flows out in every kiss, And every nerve swells with excess of bliss. [Exeunt. Cyllene comes from the side of the Stage where She stood during the last three Speeches. Cyll. Death! Hell! and Furies! What is this I hear? Now all their close Designs, and Plots are clear. I've been Abus'd, and now too plainly See Out of his Love to her he Slighted me. Now, wrong'd Cyllene, now thou may'st Command A Vengeance worthy of a Woman's hand. O were my Father here to know the Son After his Death design'd to mount his Throne, No bounds would his Revenge, and Rage confine, His would (if possible) be great as mine. Fly all respect of Nature and her Laws, 'Tis Nature bids Revenge in such a Cause. Mother, and Sister shall my Victims fall, And universal Ruine swallow all. Enter Zoilus attended with Torches and Soldiers. Zo. Where from my self shall I a shelter find? Guilt tosses like a Storm my troubled mind? With growing Fears, and gnawing Conscience lost, Each step I take, methinks I meet a Ghost. My Gen'ral and unnatural Son are fled, Ev'n my own Wife forsakes, and loaths my Bed. Raving with Prophecy, repent, repent She cries, or the Just Gods will ne'er relent. Could Penitence, indulgent Heav'n, atone So cheap, Araxes will not sell his throne. Ha! who is there, Cyllene, O my child, Why look you thus? thus like your Father wild? I hop'd for comfort from you, but I find, That is grown strange to me, and all my kind. Cyll. Ruine surrounds us, Death and Hell's at hand, Ready for plunging on the brinks we stand, While Furies to our Faces shake the brand Think on your Locris, your pretended Son, 'Tis he that pulls your headlong Ruine on. He, and your curst ingrateful Gen'ral joyn, Their Hellish aim is at your Life and mine. Zo. Ha! what pretended Son? be brief, and plain, Unless your stronger Fears have turn'd your Brain. Cyll. Your Locris is a Woman: Start at this? Once more, if I am one, I swear she is. He who so Bravely, and so Boldly Fought, Ev'n now confess'd the Woman; let this thought Make it seem possible, 'twas Love that taught; Love taught her how to weild the Sword and Spear, Love of Maherbal banish'd all her fear. Zo. Impossible, you trifle. Cyll. Do I wake? Do I see thee, my Father? do I speak? Zo. Cease your mad Questions, and your madder Tale, I saw it newly Born, and saw it Male. Cyll. Might not some Male a while supply her place, That's a stale cheat, oft known in such a case. Once the false Infant is expos'd to view, They strait return him, and take back the true. Zo. By Heav'n, thou rack'st my very brain,âforbear, Too plain, old Credulous Fool, their Plots appear. Be all my kindred, all but thou, accurst, Hell seize on all, but on Semanthe first. Fly, bid my Souldiers arm, all mount the Guard, Hast, and let every Avenue be barr'd. Would I could once that Hellish Traytress see, What Hell could furnish, should her Portion be, To Punish her, as she has punish'd me. [Exit. Cyllene alone. Cyll. Now leap my ravish'd Heart, now mount my Soul, And each extended Arm grasp either Pole. Reach yonder Starry roof, and Chrystal Spheres, And shew the Gods a Genius great as theirs. Then downwards drive, search the deep Plots of Hell, And learn if Women, or if Feinds excel. Make Fate with industry thy task pursue, For thou hast set it work enough to do. If half tir'd Furies at their toyl repine, Give them new Fury; Woman, give them thine. [Exit. Enter Semanthe. Sem. How shall I hide me from my Tyrant's sight, How shun the woes which threaten me this Night? All things so full of Fate and Death appear, As sadly tell me that my own is near. Whole Nature is in Pangs, and Groans around, Winds toss the Waters, Thunder tears the Ground, Earth feels, and shakes and staggers at the Wound. Thrice our dead Parents call'd us from the Tomb, Come Zoilus they cry'd, Semanthe come. Hark, 'tis my Husband's voice; the shrieking Ghost Sounds not so Fatal; now, 'tis now I'm lost. Fly to the Temple, have recourse to Pray'r, Alas! thou wilt not find Protection there. Without regard to any power Divine, He'll Stab thee Kneeling, tho' before the Shrine. [Scene opens she goes in. Re-Enter Zoilus with Torches. Zo. Hither I come again some ease to find, Lay, where I rais'd the tempest in my mind. All things are calm but I, no Foe appears, From my own Breast spring my own mortal Fears. Would I knew how, or what the Fates decreed, Or when, or where they destine me to bleed. Conscious, and certain of the worst to come, Secure of Death, I could out brave my doom. Lead to the Temple, either Gods or Fiends. Or Heaven or Hell shall tell what Fate intends. If they refuse to speak, when I invoke, I'll kindle to a Flame the curling Smoak, Their Idols shall be burnt, their Altars broke. The Scene of the Grove draws, and discovers the Temple, which they that bear the Torches open, Semanthe kneeling at the Altar. Sem. Save me ye Gods! Zo. Not all that rule the Sky Shall save you, by my just Revenge you die. I'll spare you yet a while, where's Locris gone? Where is that Daughter? that Impostor Son? You let Maherbal Scapeâ Sem. 'Tis Falseâ Zo. 'Tis True, As you are False, nothing is False, but you. Bane of thy Husband's and thy Soveraign's Life, Speak, Traytress, Viper, Monster, Woman, Wife! Sem. Alas! I know not. Zo. You know nothing; no; Nor when, nor whither they design'd to go. Unknown to you, I am by you Betray'd, You did not know that Locris was a Maid. All this I've learnt, give me to know the rest, Or Racks and Wheels shall tear it from your Breast. Sem. What would you more, you your curst orders gave To kill a child Heaven destin'd me to Save. Unnatural you caus'd that my Pious Cheat, Come when it will, I glory in my Fate. Zo. Die, damn'd deceiver Dieâstand off ye Slaves [Stabs her. If you tread here, you tread upon your Graves. Still Obstinate as False, is this a time? And will you not in Death confess your crime. Die in the true perverseness of your Sex, In Life and Death delighting to Perplex. [Stabs again. Sem. Spare yet the short remainder of my Life, For Locris isâ Zo. What is She? Speakâ Sem. A Wife. Wife to Araxes, your Maherbal's Wife. Zo. What? Wife to both? go on speak yet again, Speak thouâmy Wife, till you distract my Brain. Wilt thou not make me Madâ Sem. No more, adieuâ Kind Heaven forgive us both, but chiefly you. [Dies Zo. What, Speechless? Dead? hold yet, you must not go, For I have many other things to know. She's gone, no strugling warmth, no kindly spark Of Life remainsâ And I like her must wander in the Dark. Hark, the Loud Trumpets, hark, the thundring Drum, The Romans, and the Conqu'ring Rebels come. Sure I have only Dreamt I was a King, Would it were all a Dreamâbut Oh! the sting Of Conscience gives at last the secret Wound, But here's to lull it fast, to Sleep so sound, As never more to Dreamâ [Falls on his Sword. Enter Cyllene. Cyll. Ha! what has Fate done here? my Mother Dead? My Father Dying, and my Sister fled? Who should have liv'd, by death's curst error fell, They live, who should have dyedâ Mistaken mischief! mangled work of Hell! How could all this be done, whose hands concern'd In the dire Fact? That yet is to be learn'd. O raise thee up a little from the ground, Tell thy Cyllene in her Sorrows drown'd, to Zoilus. Tell, sacred Sir, who gave the Fatal wound. Zo. Who durst, but I my self?âmake no reply, I've many things to ask before I die. What is become of Locris, is she Seiz'd? Tell me she is that I may perish pleas'd. Where is Maherbal, where Araxes? where The Roman Army? further Questions spare, And Answer e're my Soul dissolves in Air. Cyll. Romans and Rebels ravage all the Town, Araxes marches on to Snatch the Crown. Archias Proclaims him at his Army's head, And the War done, he and your Locris wed. Zo. Where is Maherbal then, sits he unmov'd? And lets another take the Maid he lov'd? Cyll. Maherbal is Araxesâ Zo. Spiteful Pow'rs! Hell, and Confusion! What a Fate is ours. You rave, and so do I, and all Mankind, We who boast Reason, more than Brutes are blind. Wretches like us by Heav'n decree accurst, For ruine destin'd, still run mad at first. Fate's malice I despise, her rage I slight, In a few moments in her own despight, With me it shall be Rest, and endless Night. Snatch not my Sword, Cylleneâyet you may, I have a surer, and a speedier way. Help me a while to stand erect, and straight, [She helps him up. That I may fall with greater force and weight, At once; and all together strike the ground, [tears open his wounds &amp; dies. While the Soul rushes from the gaping wound. Cyll. Farewel, great Soul; and now farewel all Fear, I am thy Off-spring, and thy Spirit's heir. Let my Malignant Stars their utmost do, I slight them, while I can escape like you. But hark, the Conqu'ring Troops in Triumph move, My rival Sister, and my Tyrant love. Hell! must I stifle my Revenge and hate? And herd with Vassals at the Temple Gate? Till the proud Victors shall pronounce our Fate. But 'tis resolv'd, there shall Cyllene stand, Off'ring Petitions with a trembling hand. Suppliant, concealing this envenom'd dart, [Drawing a Dagger. Till shooting from their feet, I reach their Heart. Drums, Trumpets. Enter Araxes, Locris, Archias Victorious. Archias leading Orythia. Araxes at the door of the Temple. Arax. From further slaughters let our Soldiers cease, Let War lie buried in profoundest Peace. Let us our Fury, and Revenge suspend, From this blest hour, Blood stanch, and Murther end. Cyll. (kneeling) Yet e're you enter these Divine aboades, The sacred Mansions of forgiving Gods, Stay, lovely, cruel Conqueror, turn, and stay, Hear a despis'd, unhappy Princess pray. Araxes raising her. Arax. O rise, you need not make your wishes known, Life, Liberty, Dominion are your own. Cyll. Could you but guess, you would recal the grant, 'Tis thus I satisfy what e're I want. [Offers at Locris, but prevented, turns the wound on her self.] Arax. Seize her, disarm her. Cyll. Behold it here, lodg'd in my bloody Breast, Tho' first intended for my Sister's Guest. This Blow will all my pain and shame remove, For failing Vengeance, and rejected Love. Gods! tho' on him your Blessings you conferr, Be Just by halvesâheap Plaguesâheap Hell on her. Soon may she Dieâshall that poor Curse suffice?â Long may she Live, long slighted, e're she dies. May she most Vertuous be, most chastly good, But he believe her most abandon'd lewd! Then may this Flourishing, yet happy she Die thus Desdain'd, thus in Dispair like me. [Dies. Arax. What sad extreams make most of Women's Fate, Raging with love, relentless in their hate: Successive passions in their turns prevail, Less fair their Person's, than their tempers frail. Lo. Oh! All ye Just, but too, too rigid Pow'rs! Let Fate no further reach to us or ours. Tho' still such Judgments such a life attend, Yet our allyance bids me mourn her end. Arax. Enter the sacred Temple, now to bind Our selves by Vows, to be but less confin'd, To mingle Souls, when once our hands are Joyn'd. You too, my Sister shortly must provide To bless young Archias in a wish'd for Bride. His Father here first wrought this turn of Fate, And I will make him, as he made me Great. On that brave Youth you must your Love bestow, For you can Rival me no longer now. Burn all our incense, all our Gods invoke, Let the thick fumes their Silver tunnels choak, And clowd the blushing Bride with Curling smoak. The Temple opens, and discovers Zoilus and Semanthe lying on two Mourning Couches, Mourners attending, and Lamps burning about them. Arax. What's this? to what a Pomp of Death I come? Speak you, or are you, like those Bodies, dumb? Who did all this? I charge you, hast, and tell, How Zoilus, and how Semanthe fell? Lo. Father, and Mother tooâart thou too dead? Then all is past, and I who came to wed, Must make the Grave, as it is thine, my Bed. [Swoons. Arax. Hold her, support her, hast, and gently bow Her bodyâleave herâShe recovers now. Lo. Are these my promis'd Nuptials? must I go Thus to be Wedded midst this World of woe? If under such a weight condemn'd to live, Still I must beg a little time to grieve. Arax. You shall not grieve alone, my Charming Fair, Give me your Sorrows, or at least my share; Too soon your Sex is with your woes opprest, Which would sit better in a manly Breast. That Mournful aspect half my hopes destroys, Those Sighs amidst my Triumphs sink my Joys. In you my Soul would have her full desire, Did not those Tragick sights your Tears require, And prove that pleasure never comes entire. FINIS.</field>
