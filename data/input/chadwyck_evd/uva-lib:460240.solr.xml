      <field name="fulltext">To the Right COMICAL A Club of Gentlemen met every Sunday Night for the Winter Season, where Mr. Sparks presided as Judge. for the Tryal of Offences committed in that Society. Lord Chief Justice SPARKS, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. MEN. 'Squire Fanfly. Beverage, a Vintner. Spunge, a led Captain. Gamble, a Sharper. Phlebotome, a mad Doctor. Scarebabe, his Man. Caustic, a Corn-Cutter. Jack Handy, the 'Squire's Gentleman. WOMEN. Capriola, a Ropedancer. Arietta, an Opera Singer. Miss Languish, an Heiress. Sybilla, her Governess. The 'Squire's Mama. Constable, Watch, Ghost, Attendants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. AIR I. Enter Gamble in a Passion This Passage has occasioned many Disputes among the Learned, how a Man could sing, if he was in a Passion? But it is easily set to rights, by supposing Gamble to be a Welchman. Paulus Purgantius.. Sings. Woe heap'd on Woe, as Wave on Wave, A Sea of Sorrows fills my Breast This is a very just Metaphor: For as Tears are of a very briny or salt Nature, they are aptly expressed by the Sea., Can mortal Man more Trouble have? By Love and Debt at once oppress'd These are very natural Distresses, and I believe one Way or other affect every Reader. Henry Hum. It is necessary here to premise the Art of the Author, in so well opening of his Poem, consonant to his Title-Page. For it is Distresse upon Distress, for a Man to be in Love and Debt at the same Time.. Enter Spunge in a Fury, and trips up Gamble This tripping up is perfectly pantomimical, and has been used with very great Success in several dramatic Entertainments, particularly King Lear, where Kent trips up the Gentleman-Usher with a very good Grace; and the Audience, as well as the several royal Personages it is done before, is convinced, that the old Nobleman is a very good Wrestler. H. H.. Gamble. Whence this Insult? Spunge. Insult, Sir? Gamble. Ay, Insult! Spunge. Be calm a Moment, and a Moment mind, Attentive list with philosophic Ear And philosophic hear.—This is the true reading. Ear is a pedantic Interpolation, alluding to an old Maxim in the Schools. H non est Litera. P. P., From Passion purged. AIR II. Gamble. Sir, you're a Scoundrel— (Loud Symphony. Sir, a Scoundrel, Damme Dam me quasi da me, pro mihi, vel redde mihi, or give me, or unto me, Satisfaction; Porphyrius Torrentius, and Lambinus, concur with me in the reading; for we cannot suppose, in a dramatic Performance, the Author would allow any Personages of the Drama to swear.— (Da Capo. Spunge. Thy boiling Rage in frothy Phrase reeks out: Repell'd by Reason's Shield, condens'd, the Steam, In dribbling Drops, falls down— This is a fine physical, hydrostatical Metaphor. For any Fluid rarified by Heat, when it meets with a cold Medium immediately condensing, conglobes in pearly Particles, adhesing to the chilly metalline, or lignified Superficies. H. H. What Body it was that the elemental Effluvias adhered to, I was long unable to determine; but fancy the Annotator must mean, by the Word Superficies, a Kettle's Covering, commonly called a Pot-lid; and the Words, metalline and lignified, I take to relate to the essential Quality of Matter it was made out of. P. P. my Wrath subsides. Gamble. Sir, I'll be damn'd— Spunge. You may; This is wrong pointed: He has stopped this Line with a Semicolon, and it should be with a Colon. Gamble. I say I will, before I'll put this up; Therefore be quick, and give me Satisfaction. Enter Beverage. Beverage. Be quiet, Puppies, are you drunk, Or dreaming? Is this a Day to fight on? This brave Day, when our young Landlord Fanfly's come of Age. Spunge. No, I was wrong, I'll take another Time. Beverage. Another Time, what Time? Hark ye, my Friend, Since you're for Time, pray give me Leave to speak Here is a Quibling on the Word Time, which is beneath the Dignity of a Tragedy Writer. To be sure, the Man had a Right to ask for his Money; but as the other does not seem ready to comply, the Demand was certainly not well timed. P. P., What Time to pay this Bill off, will you take? Gamble. We have gone too far. Beverage. Yes, in my Debt you have. So I have seen, in an unfurnish'd Room So I have seen—very unclassical—Lege, So have I seen. P. P., A needy Spider raise his air-spread Loom; From one poor Speck at first his Web begins, Thread after Thread, the Tax-free Tenant spins. Day after Day, thus you've increas'd your Score, You've spun your Threads out, and I'll trust no more. Spunge. Either I dream, or else I am awake He is either one or t'other. This is reducing Things to a Certainty, and indeed I wish all our modern Tragedy Writers would be as explicit; for it is impossible sometimes to tell by their Writings, whether they are asleep or awake., Did not I hear my dear Miss Molly speak? So have I seen—I can't tell what at present, But something, somewhere, very like her. Beverage. Come, leave your Ogling, let's attend the Squire. For him, the Sparkling Glass shall oft go round, For him, our Streets in strong October's drown'd, For him, each pimpled Cheek shall redder grow, For us he comes; and therefore Friends we'll go. (Exeunt Beverage and Gamble. Spunge. I will but make a Simile and follow; So—so—so, I don't know how to stay, or how to go, Like some poor spunging Guest, who drinks his Part, But when the Reck'ning's call'd, sleeps o'er the Quart, When waked and question'd what he has to pay, His Money gone, he don't know what to say, I do not understand how a Man can take himself away; yet it is a common Phrase among the love-selling Ladies of Covent-Garden, Drury-Lane, the Strand, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But like me, softly takes himself away. (Exit on Tiptoe. SCENE II. Enter Miss Molly and her Governess. Miss. How long, Mama, must I request in vain? Sigh for Delights, yet ne'er Delights obtain More Distress.. Want, wish, and whimper, whimper, wish, and want, I will not bear it longer, no nor can't. Governess. These sixty Years come Lammas, I ne'er knew, A Miss so mad, so Husband-mad as you. Miss. Within my Trunk, I secretly have hid, 'Tis yet untouch'd, a Pot of Marmalade: To you I'll give it, grant me? Governess. Never speak it. Miss. Why then the Devil fetch me but I'll break it Here Reader, in this Speech there is an Antitheses worthy Observation. It consists of the different Modus which Miss Molly makes use of, in applying the Verb Break. First, as breaking the Pot of Marmalade. Secondly, as breaking her own Heart. I could have been better pleased with it, had the Verb been both Times used in the first Person. H. H.. Shall I still Samplers stitch, or all the Day, Like a mere Child, with jointed Babies play? You'll break my Heart, dear Ma'am, what do you mean? I'm now no Girl, this Month I've been fourteen, Soon I'll be wed, I hope, and bedded too, I am old enough, tho' not so old as you. Governess. Long have I hobbled, wrinkled, thro' this Life, A Virgin, Widow, and a widow'd Wife By way of Ænigma. H. H.. I've try'd all Troubles, I have felt the Jars Of Cholics, Cramps, Hysterics, and Catarrhs Distress again. P. P.. Yet never grumbled, never look'd awry, Till now you force me—fye upon ye fye. Common Distress is represented by one Tragedy Handkerchief; but as this is uncommon Distress, and two-fold, and Author has judiciously doubled the Hieroglyphic. P. P. Enter Arietta, with two Tragedy Handkerchiefs. Arietta. Oh, who wou'd put their Trust in faithless Man? Have I for him refused the Lord knows who, Pensions and Placemen, Dukes, Et Cetera Plotinus, in his Dissertation upon Semi-colons, mightily recommends the Use of an Et Cetera. And Gerard Van Bergen, in the six Volumes he has published upon the Use and Antiquity of an Hyphen, has given us its Etymology and Cuts, how it is used by various Nations. H. H.. Oh I cou'd tear my Tucker, burn my Tete, Let me have Room to rave in, now I fret, Pray let me fan myself—Lord, how I sweat Though this may seem somewhat indelicate, it is very natural. For to be a Passion, or be in a Heat, are compatible, nay sometimes synonymous. Now it is not at all contradictory to the animal System to suppose, that when any one is in a Heat, Perspiration may ensue. P. P. Miss. Ma'am, with Submission, but I beg to know, If you think fit to fit a Bit or so, If Love, it is the Cause of your o'erthrow? Arietta. Madam, your Servant, but pray now be seated, Heigh, ho! Lord help me, I'm so tosticated Pro intoxicated, aude common Conversation. To mutilate, metamorphise, and transmigrate the English Language, is at present the polite Taste, while on the contrary, the Under-bred, instead of curtailing out of an unwonted Generosity, add to their Dialect, e. g. Mem pro Madam at St. James's. Misturs pro Madam, St. Giles's. H. H. Here I cannot help observing the Particularity of Stile used by Tradesmen, Brokers, &amp;c. of the Metropolis of Great Britain. They look on the Pronouns He or I to be no ways essential in their Advertisements, but think the Word Said sufficient. And I hear there is a Complaint lodged in Nassan Court, by said Pronouns, backed by Particle The, against Dublin News Printers, for same Fault. Said Printers not given said Words fair Play in Advertisements.. Know ye, young Fanfly's Lady? Miss. Very well.— Arietta. Miss, you'll excuse me, but I think it 'tant. Miss. Dear, Ma'am, proceed, I vow I meant no Harm. Governess. No, that I'll swear for, pray, Ma'am, don't be warm. Arietta. Then Ladies know I was, but what of that? I am at present, but I don't know what Don't know what. This Line is perfectly metaphysical. For her Ideas being certainly too circumstantially disturbed, i. e. (disturbed by her present Circumstances) it was impossible by this Parity of Reasoning, she could form a proper Assemblage of them, or range them in a just Order, to think that what she was.. On that fam'd Stage, where Perseus oft has flew, Where Faustus conjur'd, and where Orpheus play'd, With warbling Songs, I've charm'd attentive Crouds, And Lords done Homage round me as at Court. The Levee-throng'd Dependants watch their Prince, To catch the secret Whisper, snatch his Smiles, And then strut happy Home, big grown with Hope. At length, one fatal Eve the Squire came, Protested Love, presented, but, O Gods! His Words were weighty, for his Gifts were large. He begg'd, I granted, but I can no more: He's lost, I'm left, and all my Splendour's o'er More Distress. H. H.. Miss. Madam, for once, a Girl's Advice receive, No longer for the unconstant Fanfly grieve. Were I like you, I'd all Resentment smother, And since I've lost one Love, I'd get another Natural enough. P. P.. Governess. Be ruled, good Madam, think how old I am, Take my Advice, my Dear, and drink a Dram Very natural that too. H. H.. Arietta. Wou'd I were drunk; nay, drunk I will be too, And when I am I'll make the Devil to do Clymax of Naturalities. H. P.. Ye gilded Chariot, and ye rich Brocade, And the dear I am at a Loss how to understand the Adjective dear, whether it relates to the Dearness of the Ticket, or whether the Joys she had there were dear pro endear'd to her. Joys of midnight Masquerade, A long Adieu, now thro' the filthy Town, In dirty Hackney, and in plain silk Gown, Must I be drove; perhaps 'tis worse decreed, And thro' the Streets in Pattens I must tread. Perhaps mend Stockings; O, ye cruel Gods! Or scrub my Flesh off in the sharp Soap-Suds. Governess. Hope for the best, my Dear, send for the Squire. Arietta. I to the Creature send, excuse me Ma'am, What like a Wife petition? if I do; And now, I think on't, I will make a Vow Make a Vow—This Vow is made with Premeditation, and as it ought to be; for tho' Swearing is at present in tip top Taste, and quite the Thing, I don't believe the Generality of Gentlemen Cursers take a sufficient Time to recollect what they are going to do when they swear; for it is proper to consider, that an Oath may be sometimes used periodically, sometimes expletively, at other Times by way of Corroboration. Further, I must needs say, that tho' there are some Persons, called Clergymen, who will make a Bustle about Duty, Decency, and Religion, and pretend, indeed, to have Swearing abolish'd, it would be as pernicious to Conversation, as the Prohibition of Spirits would be to Dram-Drinkers; For as Oaths not only interlard but make up two Parts in three of several Persons Conversation, what could those choice Spirits say if they were not to swear. Why, upon the nicest Calculation, according to de Moivre, Sympson Leibnitz, &amp;c. it therefore follows, that they must be condemned to sit silent two Thirds of that Time they now fill up with such elegant Volubility. P. P. H. H. There is something so daringly wicked in this calling upon God to confirm a momentous Relation, or upon the least Affront received, commanding a Deity to condemn them to eternal Perdition, that I cannot think common Swearers believe there is a God that hears them; or, perhaps, more modest, imagine the Deity thinks such Reptiles too much below his Notice to punish.. Here is a long Speech, which, I believe, was introduced for no other Design than to show the Author was deep read in Romance, and had a tolerable or intolerable Knack at Description. P. P. He is to be commended for it, since as every Reader is look'd on as a Guest, and an Author is to furnish out as good a Feast as he can for the Reader's Entertainment; and, as at Gentlemen's Houses vast Pieces of Plate, ornamented, tho' useless, adorn the Side-board; so, as Authors can seldom, that way, please their Guests, they are right to open the Richness of their Fancy for them. H. H. Hear me ye Naiads, Fairies, Nymphs and Fawns, Who wanton lave amidst the chrystal Streams; That o'er the smooth-worn Pebbles plays Thro' flow'ry Vales, and daisy-sprinkled Meads: And ye who govern the high-waving Woods; Who secret dwell in sun-sequestred Groves, And nightly dance thro' arch-embower'd Walks. Ye Hamadryads hear! Ye sullen Gnomes That flit on foggy Clouds from Earth uprais'd: Ye purer Sylphs, that skim the midway Air; And all ye Genii of the Deep attend. If I request, petition, send, or sue, May Thunder split my Snuff-box all to pieces, And Lightnings burn my Brussels Mob to Ashes. Miss. But you'll see him Madam. Arietta. I'll be blind first truly; no, I'll now, With weary, wandring, melancholy, tread; Goaded by Griefs, disconsolately creep: On the soft Pillow rest my aching Head, Sob like a Child, and sigh my self to sleep, Snore out my Wrongs and dream—the Lord knows what What I in Vision see, that I'll fullfil, If 'tis my Blood, or Pen-dipt-Ink to spill: To end my Woes at once by well-set Knife This was once in Vogue., Or vindicate my Wrongs, and write my Life This is at present the Taste..

Are you, or are you not By this Speech we learn that Phlebotome was one of those Philosophers called Scepties. They were remarkable for doubting if they could see, or doubting the Existence of whatever they did see; like some Moderns who cannot, will not, or must nor believe their Eyes, nor too critically attend to the Evidence and Examination of any of their other Senses.

Ask thou the Cause: 'Twas Squire Fanfly did it; If I forgive it; but it is no Matter; Few Words are best; so I'll relate it briefly. As Yesternoon I thro' St. James's walk'd, With tuneful Sound, enquiring, as I past, Who wanted Ease from the toe-troubling Corn, A neat white-stockin'd Footman, down whose Ears Two twisted Papers dangled (pendant thus The String tied Cherry vibrates: Infant play) In Squire Fanfly's Name, with courteous Air, Requested my Attendance; hapless Jobb.

In that wet Season, when descending Rains Stream thro' the Streets, and swell along the Lanes. When Mud obnoxious o'er the Pavement spread, Soils the white Stocking at each mirey Tread. When the shrill Link-boy plies the Playhouse Door, And Mack'rel pleasing Cry, is heard no more. When Strength-restoring Oysters are in prime; Or, in plain English, it was Winter-Time; Then was Peel Garlick toss'd. Caustic. How did he bear it? Phlebotome. At the first Toss he puked, then loudly swore, But when the Blanket burst, he said no more; But dropt down swift into the common Shore. O'erwhelm'd with Filth, he wallow'd in the Mud, And groap'd his Way out, flound'ring thro' the Flood. Caustic. Why must the Great have Privilege to kick, And not the Poor return it? Partial Fate! Domitian thus the Spider's Prey purloined Domitian, the Roman Emperor, used to amuse himself with killing Flies, till he had destroyed the Maggot-bred Progeny, upon which it was wittily said, by a Philosopher, (who was asked if the Emperor had any one with him) no, not so much as a Fly., And tilted Flies for Pastime. Cruel Sport! Ye Gods, why gave ye me a Monarch's Soul, And wrapp'd it up in such a wretched Case! Phlebotome. But see, who's this approaches? With what State She seems to tread, and side-long how she holds Her Hoop wide op'ning, O Circean Cave This is an odd Epithet, and I am convinced the Author never designed it so; but by the Blunder of some ignorant Transcriber, it has crept into the Text. In the first Place, Circe never wore a Hoop. Secondly, she lived not in a Cave. Thirdly, but enough has been said to prove what it is not; let us consider what it is. This Doctor is a learned Man; h? there speaks Latin, Cave beware; and the other Word is either calling her by her Name, which was Cecilia; as for Instance, Oh Cicely, beware, don't stumble; for she might hold her Hoop so high, that she could not look before her: Or else it is, Oh Silesian Cave; her Hoop might he made of that Sort of Stuff. P. P.. Know ye the Dame? Scarebabe. Yes, 'tis Capriola. A Mistress Fanfly keeps, let us go seek the Squire. Caustic. I know where to find him. Phlebotome. Go you before, and I will follow after This is very natural; for if one goes before, the other must follow after, unless, as it sometimes happens, on the Stage, for one to pull the other back, and so go out first, according to the old Proverb, he is first at last, though he was behind before. P. P. Mr. Pedasculus has a Mind to be merry with his Proverb, and wrest the Author's Meaning to an Explanation never intended. To pull one back, and step in his Place, or get before him, in an Action common to all Men, as well off, as on the Stage, and may be properly called, the Art of Supplanting. H. H.. Methinks I walk in Stilts, I'm so elated, To have a wealthy Patient: o'the Rapture! As Gallen has it in his second Chapter. Cathartics and Narcotics I'll apply, Nephretics and Emetics we must try, And drain for Drugs the Dispensary dry. The Attorney thus to lengthen out his Suit, Forbids Peace-making, and foments Dispute; Incessant watches o'er his Client's Purse, Makes good Things bad, and bad he makes much worse. So Squire Fanfly, if I can allure him, I'll make him mad, and afterwards I'll cure him. SCENE, Covent-Garden. Enter Capriola, and Servant. Capriola. Away; go troop, or I will tread your Guts out. Arietta, o'the Sing-song dirty Trull, For her neglected? Servant. Be but easy, Madam. Capriola. And shall a bunting Ballad-singer hold him? Sooner shall Spaws with Kennel Water flow; Sooner shall Modesty Preferment gain; Sooner I'll hang myself, and there's an End on't. Servant. Here comes the Lady. Capriola. O! the dirty Minx. Enter Arietta This is a Scene of Altercation. I cannot help reminding the Reader of the Diversity of Scenes, Stiles, and Similes in this elaborate Performance. And herein I follow the Steps of the Editor of Mr. Pope's Works, who has pointed out to every Reader, all the Species of Writing, the Author of the Essay on Man used in the latter Part of that Poem, doubting, or despising the Capacities of his Readers; or else imagining, that Philosophy and Poetry are always to be examined by classical Scale and Compass, like the Mathematician, who only read Virgil, to examine by the Map, how, Navigator-like, he had conducted Æneas in his Voyage. H. H.. Arietta. Are you the Wench whom they Capriola call? Capriola. Yes, Miss Mock-modesty, what then? Arietta. —That's all. Some People are impertinent, 'tis true, And wou'd rob other People of their Due, But, Ma'am, excuse me, I don't think 'tis you. Capriola. Good lack-a-day, and so they bid me tell you. Lord, I shall faint, but I despise such Creatures It is pronounced Creters. P. P., If I must talk, it shall be to your Betters. Your Impudence, all Billingsgate exceeding, Declares you know not what belongs to Breeding. Arietta. Madam, you're humble, but you're so notorious, I dare not talk, you know the World's censorious. Shou'd my Friends see me hold you in Discourse To hold you in Discourse—or to force Discourse, Phrases of Course., I shou'd be thought as bad as you, or worse. Capriola. As bad as me! Ill Manners I detest, Begging your Pardon, you're a nasty Beast. Have you forgot how high in Drury-Lane, Drench'd by the Drippings of the drizzling Rain, On broken Bedstead, deck'd by dirty Rugs, You nightly snor'd, bit by Blood-loving Bugs? At Morning's Dawn you left your stinking Flocks, To foot Silk Stockings, and to mend old Socks; In Winter Evening, you'd the Parish teaze, With bak'd Ox Cheek, or calling out grey Pease. At Midnight strole along the silent Lane, And draggled, sneak to Garret back again. Arietta. Methinks, Ma'am, you are drest in a delicate Taste, What a Pity it is your Complexion won't last? How her Cloaths are hung on, and how set is each Feature, Let me die, but I think you're a comical Creature. But least the Dispute, by bad Words, should grow long, I'll the Argument end, Child, and give you a Song. Enter Jack Handy. Jack Handy.

Jack Handy. Young Squire Fanfly's coming, that's enough. Enter Squire Fanfly. Beverage kicking his Drawer However queer it is to be kicked, and though it may not be pleasing to feel, it is to see, since it is practised on the Stage with great Applause. H. H. Think not, Reader, I am intending to ridicule the Tastes of an Audience, or imagine they cannot distinguish. Far be it from me, to hint at such a Falsity: But I would fain have the Actors never endeavour at Applause, by any Buffoonery, or debase the Dignity of Nature, by uncouth Grimace, and supply the Want of true Humour with farcical Face-making. H. H.. Fanfly. At length, my Friends, at last is come the Day, The long-expected, the long-talk'd-of Day, This Day of Days; and now we'll make a Night on't How to make Night of Day, I cannot reconcile this Line. I have often, indeed, heard Persons talk of making a Night on't; and out of Curiosity, I once went to see some Spirits perform; but they made nothing on't, unless making one another drunk could be termed making any Thing. P. P.. (Huzza. Gamble. Permit me, Squire, to join this happy Cry, And as I stand on Tiptoe with you joy. Fanfly. Tom Gamble, Friend, thy Merit's truly great, Whether you crack a Joke, or break a Pate; I've seen thy Stick high brandish'd o'er the Foe, Flash on his Face, and bleed him at a Blow: Then o'er the Midnight Glass, I have heard thee speak, And Puns, like Hiccups, from thy Bosom break: So like thy Wit, embottl'd Small-beer works, Flies frothy up, and rumbling bursts the Corks. And thou, my Beverage, I've seen, Trip up the nimblest on the Green, And heard thee in stentorean Sounds, Out-roar the deep-mouth'd op'ning Hounds: So have I heard, amidst the Shouts Of Bonfires, Mobs on Powder Plots, A snapping Cracker shake the Plain, And bounce and burst, and bounce again. Beverage. But you've done more, what's all that we can show, To what the Squire has done, or what the Squire may do? Fanfly. What I have done? (but 'tis not fair to boast) Can none remember, and yet sure all must, How I disputed once with the fam'd Henley Vulgarly called Orator. Vide Dunciad. I have heard the Author of this Parody several Times disputed with him. If so, I really think he has very truly depicted himself. H. H. This is a Parody on the Speech of Alexander the Great. Can none remember? Yes sure all must. When Glory, like a dazzling Eagle, stood Perch'd on my Beaver, in the Granic Flood, When Fortune's Self, my Standard trembling bore, And the pale Fates stood frighted on the Shore, When the Immortals on the Billows rode, And I myself appear'd the leading God.? When Folly, like a chatt'ring Magpye, sat Full on my Forehead, thro' the whole Debate, On Wings of Bats between us Dullness bore, And common Sense stood trembling at the Door, Words wav'd on Words, on Nonsense, Nonsense roll'd, And I myself appear'd the greatest Scold. Arietta comes forward. O Arietta, O my warbling Dear, Whose Voice is sweeter than the tuneful Sound Of well-match'd Beagles, op'ning in full Cry; Thy Eyes are brighter than the Glow-worms Light, Thy Cheeks are redder than the ripen'd Peach, Suffer thy Swain those fragrant Fruits to reach. Capriola goes between. Capriola. That I forbid, nay, start not, Sir, 'tis I. Arietta. Turn this Way, Squire, this Way cast your Eye This Way cast your Eye. It will be very proper for the Gentlemen and Ladies of the Theatre, the younger Sort I mean, to be very perfect in this Exercise of the Eye, and also in the verticular Motion of the Head. For it is common Practice among them, to talk to the Pit, more than to the Performer that's along with them; and also, when they are spoke to, it is proper for them to seem to mind what is said, and not, while a Description is related to them, or any Story that affects the Personage they represent, be looking round the Audience for their Acquaintance, &amp;c. P. P.. SONG. By the Joys of Embrace, when entwin'd in my Arms, While languishing Love fill'd our Eyes, You murmuring swore, you'd be true to my Charms, And sealed it with short-broken Sighs Love fill'd our Eyes—Nonsense—Loving filling the Eyes, and Murmurs, and short-broken Sighs. These are all unnatural Phrases, fit only for Novel-Writers, &amp;c. It is now several Years since my first Cohabitation with my Wedlock-joined Friend, and though Nature calls for a Satisfaction of carnal Appetite, Posterity for an Increase of Inhabitants, and even Marriage-Laws demand fulfilling, I never met with any of the above-mentioned Languishings. They are heterogeneous to the Improvement of our Species, and since we are commanded to increase, we should go about to obey that Precept, as Philosophers, as Scholars, and as wise Men ought to do, soberly and cooly, as we should take off a Glass of Wine, not madly and voraciously, as intoxicating Epicures swallow Pint-Bumpers. P. P.. Fanfly. Bravo, my Life, my lovely Arietta, There—there's my Purse, if you want Money, take it, But take not me, for I am all Arietta's. Sooner shall Jews sly Jesuits become, And Presbyterians kiss the Toe of Rome. Wits follow Whitfield, an itinerant Field-preacher, who was followed by Multitudes of both Sexes, whose weak Minds were startled by the terrible Anathemas he vociferously thundered against them. He set himself as a Refiner of the Christian Religion, in a Manner repugnant to all Rules of Decency, Morality, or good Manners. N. B. These Things happened at a Time when the Works of Boyle, Barrow, Lock, and Tillotson, lay unheeded, on Dust-fill'd Shelves, and within a few Years of that remarkable Æra, called the Year of the Bottle-Conjurer. Whitfield, Whores adore plain Dealing. St. Giles's to St. James's shall remove, Sooner than I'll neglect this Lady's Love. Capriola.

So pendant cross a Line, I've oft seen hung, Two tail-ty'd Cats, and spitting as they swung; Teeth gnash with Teeth, with Talons, Talons jar, 'Till scratching ends this caterwauling War. Capriola. Where shall the wretched Capriola waddle? Upon Misfortunes now I sit a-straddle This is a very pertinent Simile, to sit a-straddle upon Misfortune, i. e. to ride the wooden Horse of Adversity.. Will you not kiss me, Squire? Fanfly. Fiddle faddle. Arietta. Your Absence, Madam, will prevent Reproach, Will you walk off, or will you have a Coach? Capriola. Trollop, 'tis well, at length, my ebbing Pride Returns again, swift as a high Spring-Tide: And by this Box, this Pinchbeck-Box, I swear Pinchbeck—Pinchdeck'd Box it should be. It means to deck it with a Pinch of Snuff, or to be deck'd with a Pinch of Snuff. H. H. Whether it should be deck'd, or no, I cannot tell certainly, since greater Men than me have been divided about using that Word: For, in the Tempest, Act I. Scene the Second, there is the Word deck'd, according to Mr. Theobalds. Who deck'd with Tears the Sea. Oxford Edit. Brack'd with Tears the Sea, i. e. made the Salt-water brackish. Warburton. Mock'd with Tears the Sea. Dr. Bentley. Stock'd with Tears the Sea. I say, repugnantibus omnibus, it should be, flock'd, i. e. the Tears flock'd to the Sea. P. P.; Which never more this Pinch of Snuff shall share, I, unconcern'd, Inconstancy can bear. I'll take a Link myself and light you Home; Nay, make your Bed, and sweep you out your Room: But first a Pound of Gun-powder I'd buy, Under the Bed it secretly shou'd lye; Then take a Match, and to repay this Evil, I'll blow you both together to the Devil. (Throws Snuff in Arietta's Face, and exit. Arietta. O, Squire Fanfly, I am almost choak'd; How cou'd you leave me for a Slut so saucy? How did you get her? tell me; I'll forgive you. Fanfly. So I will. Once on a Time, past Twelve o'Clock at Night, When ev'ry Lamp was out, and at each Stand The drowsy Watchman snor'd thro' the dark Street; No Flambeaux-blazing Chariot flash'd along, But gloomy Night in humdrum Silence mop'd; Disguis'd with Drink, and for a Frolick fit; By Help of Ladder raised to mend the Roof, Hap'ly I stole, unheeded, to her Garret. Beverage. 'Twas lucky, tho' you did not break your Bones. Fanfly. So it was. I found the sleepy, trapish, tipling, Fair, Snoring, supinely, on a three-legg'd Chair. A ragged Stocking hid one tawny Fist, Drawn, like a Muffatee, a-down her Wrist. Drop'd by her Side lay diff'rent colour'd Yarn, With which the industrious Nymph was wont to darn. A twinkling Light within the Socket gleam'd; I reel'd to reach it, and the Damsel scream'd: I snatch'd the Fair, half-waking, to my Breast; And then; but mum, I must not tell the rest I think our Squire is something more modest than Lothario however. P. P.. Arietta. O, the dear Rake, the lovely midnight Rogue; O, I could jump into a Ditch to meet thee, And wander with thee in a Winter's Rain. Let pimpled Prudes on Citron Waters dote, And may stale Maids their sleek-comb'd Lap-dogs love; For thee, my Dear, Imperial Tea I'd spill, Forgo the Fashion, and forget Quadrille. Fanfly. Here this Coquets, curse on your Constitutions, My Heart dances a Hornpipe; I am I know not how; but when 'tis Night I will do—what I will. Arietta. And so you shall. Go now, and take a Bottle with your Friends; But stay not late, nor come not, Love, in Liquor. Like the poor Turtle I shall sit forlorn, Waiting to welcome you, and have the Bed warm'd. (Exit. Enter Sybilla the Governess. Governess. Sir, if you please, a Word or two with you. Fanfly. Madam, your humble Servant; how do you do. Governess. Well, Sir, I thank you, and hope you're so too. Fanfly. Here! bring some Wine. Governess. I'll drink none as I live. Fanfly. Pray, Lady fair, one single Glass receive. Governess. No; pray excuse me. Fanfly. Pray excuse me, Ma'am. One single Glass can never do you Harm. Governess. Well, Squire, I vow you're such another Man—! I'm quite confounded; but, since here I am, And I must drink, my Dear, I'll drink a Dram. (Drinks. But to my Purpose, Sir, you are to know, Since my poor Husband's Death, who left me low; Tho', little did he think it wou'd be so; I've kept a Boarding-School, 'tis now three Years, To shew young Misses Plain-work, and their Pray'rs. I form their female Minds, I mend their Tastes, Teach them to read, and raise the various Pastes; To knot the bordering Fringe, to whip the Seam, The Lawn to flourish, and to skim the Cream. Amidst the pretty, prattl'ing, playing, Fair, (By their kind Parents trusted to my Care,) There's one Miss Languish, handsome, on my Word, And rich enough to make a Man a Lord To make a Man—then Spunge should say, O Lord! It is a natural Exclamation of a Man much indebted himself, upon hearing of a Woman who would, make a Man, to break out into such a surprize—O Lord—For the Future therefore it must be thus; ? handsome, on my Word, And rich enough to make a Man. Spunge. —Oh Lord! P. P. Fanfly. For me, perhaps. Governess. Perhaps so—Lack-a-day. Yet who knows that; for, as some Folks will say, We'are gone To-morrow, tho' we're here To-day. All our first Bread we're certain where we eat; The Wisest knows not where his last he'll get; For tho' we're born we are not bury'd yet. But to my Purpose; tho', as I was saying, Miss Molly Languish; well, a-lack-a-day; Indeed, 'tis Pity; so, indeed, you'll say: She pouts, she glouts, she moaps, she frets, she fumes, And all for what? Why, for a Husband truly: But how do you think all this is brought about, Why Love and Murder always will come out, As my Spouse us'd to say—that's without Doubt Without doubt—alluding to the Apothegm of Pythagoras's Daughter, fine dubitante. H. H.. Fanfly. What's this to me, Ma'am? Governess. Why, Sir, you shall hear. There is a Fellow that belongs to you, Who, like a Peacock, struts and makes a Shew, Has turn'd her Head, and makes her talk of Wedlock; Of losing Maidenheads, and merry Christ'nings: This Fellow follows us from Street to Street, Winks thro' the Windows, ogles her incessant; At Meals at Home, on Sunday at the Church; No Place is free, he frights me with his Stares, He spoils our Dinner, and disturbs our Prayers. Fanfly. What is his Name? Governess. Spunge, Sir, I think, he's call'd. Fanfly. Go, somebody, and seek him. Beverage. Here he comes, unlook'd for. Enter Spunge, drunk. Fanfly. O, come hither Scoundrel: You spunging, shifting, sharking, shuffling Wretch, Who, Spaniel-like, at well-fill'd Tables waits.— Governess. Ay, Mr. what d'ye call'm; marry come up— Fanfly. Nay, give me Leave, Madam. Hark ye, Sirrah. How dare you? Spunge. Be fuddl'd, I presume: Why, I have been drinking Bumpers to your Health, And, if you grudge it, Sir, why then, good-bye to you. Fanfly. Hold, Sir, take one Glass more before you go Wit.. (Throws Wine in his Face. Spunge. How soon you see a modest Man is dash'd More Wit., It's damn'd ungen'rous tho', to give me Wine Most Wit. These are the three Degrees of Comparison in Wit. The first Degree is the Hum, i. e. endeavouring to impose on the Credulous, e. g. He says, he will give him another Glass of Wine; but, how does he give it? The other stands ready to take it; but how does he take it? The second Degree of Wit consists in the Action of throwing a Glass of Wine. This may be properly called, Wit-pantomimical, just like throwing Tobacco-pipes out of a Joke, burning Waiters Wigs in Fun, scorching the Shoes of their sleey Companion, or blackening his Face, or hiding his Pocket-book. The third is, the Paranomasia, or Pun, to dash and hit., And hit me in the Teeth with it. Fanfly. You'll go a Courting, will you, courting Ladies! Governess. Ay, and fine Ladies too! Meat for his Master. Spunge. Had I been sober, tho' you are a Squire, You had not dared to strike me. Fanfly. Dared not, damn you. Spunge. Damn you; no, you dare not. Fanfly. Give me a Horsewhip, Cane, a Mop, or Beesom. Gamble. O Sir, have Patience The Supplication. Fanfly. Preach Patience to your Creditors, you Block-head The Replication.: Where is the Scoundrel? Spunge. Who is it you mean? Fanfly. Go to the Pump you Sloven, and get clean. Go pump him, that will wash him, for he wants it The Application.. (Hits a Mop in his Face. Spunge. Be warn'd, ye Youths, ye ever-thirsty Souls, Who fond of Frolicks, doat on midnight Bowls; By my Example learn to shun my Fate, How wretched is the Man who loves to prate: If you can work; O! stick to what your Trade is, Strong Liquors leave, and making Love to Ladies. (Carried off. Fanfly. Wou'd ye, fair Maids, our secret Failings scan, And as you pick your Laces chuse the Man. Tho' Lace bespangled hides the strong clos'd Seam, And the Paste Buckles o'er the Instep beam: Tho' o'er the Hat the Milk-white Feather's spread, The Plumy Play-Thing shades a brainless Head. Did ye but know the gay embroider'd Coat Oft cloaths a Coxcomb, oft conceals a Sot. But 'tis in vain, fatally fond of Shew, You see, and sigh in Secret—Heav'ns! a Beau You wish to wed—and often after find A rotten Carcase and a wretched Mind. Splendid thus monumental Marbles shine, Tho' foul Corruption fills the gorgeous Shrine. Beverage. Now, if you please, Sir, we'll go in to Dinner. Fanfly. With all my Heart, Tom Beverage, make some Punch Punch—from Punic—base, treacherous; because it often steals away our Reason. P. P.: Then, like a Thing, o'me the mad Macedonian, Like Cæsar, Cyrus, or like any other. But why shou'd I of any other tell, None but myself can be my Parallel This borrowed Line is partly geometrical, partly mathematical, partly mechanical, and partly neither. H. H.: Then, like myself, exalted will I stand, With a Pint Bumper in my lifted Hand; Time, Life's worst Load, in Liquor shall be lost, And at each Glass we'll sacrifice a Toast: Noctural Rites, uncheck'd by saucy Care, To Joy-inspiring Bacchus we'll prepare; God of good Fellow, Vintage-blessing Power, O beam propitious on our social Hour, With smiling Bowls we'll laugh the Night away; We'll love Tomorrow, but get drunk To-day. End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE a Tavern, all sitting round. Governess asleep on one Side. Fanfly. Here's to our noble Selves, and those that love us; All drink it deep, and make the Welkin roar With Undulation dire. Sound away. Enter Beverage, Gamble, and Spunge. How now! Did I not order you shou'd pump that Fellow? Beverage. So we wou'd, Sir, but for one cogent Reason. Fanfly. What was that? Beverage. He would not let us. Fanfly. Oh, oh! Beverage. Hear us with Patience, and we'll tell our Tale. Gamble. This memorable Day, to After-times, Shall stand recorded as a Day of Wonders, While Windows shall with Verse obscene be scratch'd: While Thieves die sniv'ling in Sternholdian Rhymes; While the luxurious Rich love Ranelagh; Or while the Poor on Sunday fill the Fields, This Deed shall live in Monthly Magazine. Beverage. Upright, amidst my Stable-Yard, firm-brac'd With Iron Hoops; Spoils of well empty'd Casks, Deep in the Ground transfixed; there stands a Pump, Well known to Carriers, and to scolding Queans; Whose Heads have oft beneath the Spout been drench'd Been duck'd, it should be, for it implies their Heads were stooped, or bent, under the Pump. Think not, Reader, this Emendation unnecessary, since our best Critics seldom change Words to bettter Purpose, e. g. Merchant of Venice. Act IV. Scene the Second. Shapespear. The Danger formerly by me rehears'd.—Spoke by Portia. Warburton. The Danger formally by me rehears'd. If you think fit, vide Bentley's Note on the Words sacred and secret in Milton. Another Alteration here, I beg Leave to insert, of Mr. Warburton's. Mercutio's Speech of Queen Mab, he says she comes, In Shape no bigger than an Agate Stone set in a Ring. Mr. Warburton will have it, In Shade, i. e. like a Comet. Again, in Coriolanus: A Volscian tells Meninius, that Coriolanus will front his Revenges with the Groans of old Women. The Virginal Palms of their Daughters, i. e. the held-up Hands. The palsied Intercessions of old Dotards. That is, the Mothers may beg, the Children supplicate, the Fathers intercede in vain. Mr. Warburton will alter Palms to Pasmes, or pames, from the French Pasmer or Pamer, i. e. Swooning Fits. Was the learned Critic to be ask'd, What Occasion for Notes on these Places? Could he tell us he made the Text better?—No; more intelligible—no. Why, then all these learned, laborious Annotations—Why, for the same Reason Butchers blow Veal, to make the Commodity swell, and sell better.: Salubrious Stream; for female Tongues a Cure; At your Command he underneath was plac'd. My Ostler ready at the Handle stood, With out-stretch'd Arm; but as we sometimes see The watching Cat leap on the Mouse surpriz'd, And grasp her hard; so swift he sideway sprung, And seized my Servant with athletic Gripe, Trip'd up his Heels; then swung him swiftly round, And souc'd him over Head within the Horse-pond. Gamble. Then with a Look, fierce as Bumbailiff's Face, He grasp'd, with raw-bone Fists, the deep-fixed Pump, Sqeezing it close, then writhed it too and fro, From the Foundation loosening, by the Roots Uplifting tore it, with Herculean Hurl, Upon the flinty Pavement flung it down; Horrid to see, and shiver'd it to Splinters. Fanfly. Tom Spunge, your Hand—you have been very silly; But let that pass, no Man is wise at all Times Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit.—Here, Reader, please to observe by this, and several other Quotations, truly classical, our Author was a Man of great Learning. This I think proper to premise, lest After-ages should dispute whether he had any or no? As by the famous Play-writer, Shakespear, we have an Example; who several will not allow to have been a Man of any Learning; tho' we must be Men of Learning; ay, and good Learning too, to read him. P. P.. That Colt, got by Bay Bolton, I will give you: In some frequented Inn, I'll set you up, And for a Sign you shall hang out a Pump; But now sit down. Tom Beverage sing a Song. Shall I get drunk, or shall I not, my Friends: Let me consider; 'tis a Point precarious. To drink, or not to drink, that's the Question: Whether 'tis nobler in a Man to suffer From Gout, or Dropsy, by outrageous Drinking, Or prudent arm our Reason 'gainst Debauch, By Temperance to cure them. Let me think: If by a social Glass or two, we cure The Vapours, and elate the Woe-worn Mind; 'Tis a Prescription which ev'ry Wretch should take. To thirst—to drink—to drink perhaps too much. Ah! there's the Rub—the Fear of getting drunk Adorns Sobriety with all its Charms: Else, who'd Attendance and Dependance feel? Who'd gloomy sit, on rainy Days, at Home? By Weather mop'd: Who'd be by Spleen oppress'd? Or, sorrowing, sigh for an ungrateful Fair? Bad Luck at Hazard, or worse Luck at Law? When each, at once, might lay Remembrance dead Lay Remembrance dead—Ay, but how—Why, by drinking to be sure, that must be his Meaning. There is a Line in Shakespear's As you like it, of striking dead, spoke by the Clown, which has been altered, and interpreted, I think, very oddly. The Line is, It strikes a Man more dead than a great Reckoning in a little Room. The Oxford Edition alters it to a great Reeking in a little Room. Mr. W. denies that, keeps to the original Text, but says, the Line means that the Bill was very extravagant, and every Thing the Guests had, very bad and mean. So in Edgar's Description of Dover Cliff, the Surge that o'er the idle Pebbles plays. Idle there, Mr. W. says, means barren, uncultivated. Now, would not it do, if we considered them, as idle, to lie still, and let the Water pass over them? What Occasion for a Note there, and such a forced Interpretation? Another, as forced an Interpretation of this modern Scholiast, we find on a Line in Love's-Labour lost, Act I. Scene 1. This Child of Fancy, Mr. W. says, Shakespear calls them, Children of Fancy; not for being beholden to Fancy for their Birth, but because Fancy has its Infancy as well as Manhood. Vide his Note on Romances at p. 260, at the End of the abovementioned Play., Did not the Dread of being sick next Day, Or the worse Dread of not knowing how to pay, Puzzle Desire, and make us rather choose To stay at Home, in Poverty and Thirst, Than run into Diseases, and in Debt? Enter Drawer. Drawer. An' please your Worship, here's your Huntsman wants you. Fanfly. Let him come in. Enter Huntsman. Well, what's the Matter, Sirrah? Huntsman. As I sat smoaking in my Landlord's Kitchen This Description, I cannot say, requires any Explanation; but as I am not willing the Reader should lose any Observation, especially those that are right-worthy to be read, I shall here offer to his Consideration, one of Mr. W. on the Entrance and Words of a Servant in the Winter's Tale, Act IV. Scene 7. A Servant tells his Master, that twelve Labourers have made themselves all Men of Hair to dance. Mr. W. observes, that Men of Hair signifies Men nimble, and that the Phrase is taken from Tennis-Balls, because they are stuffed with Hair; so that the Sense is, they are stuffed with Hair. Now when they enter, it happens they were all dressed like Satyrs, all in shaggy Dresses made of Hair, which was what the Servant meant; but his Interpretation is like the Foreigner's, who mistook the Words under a Sign, Money for live Hair, to signify, Money for living here., I heard a mighty Hollooing in the Streets: I left my Pipe, and ran to know the Matter. I saw Capriola in a mighty Hurry, Heading a Mob, and throwing Money to them: She brib'd the mercenary Dogs to march To Charing-Cross, and break Miss Ary's Windows. Fanfly. Thus from the Glass, I rise to save my Love, Go, call a Coach, on Wings of Windmills move; Swift as the Bullet, bursting from the Gun, Rattling like Thunder, thro' the Streets we'll run, And when we'are there, we'll see what's to be done. (Exeunt. SCENE, a Bed-chamber. The scrupulous Exactness that Mr. W. pays to the coming of Hamlet's Ghost, here must be remembered. Hamlet tells the Ghost, Be thy Intents wicked or charitable. Mr. W. will have it, Be thy Advent wicked or charitable. Now, be judge, O Reader, how nicely this is altered. The Son says, Be thy Intentions good or bad, this is plain. The Critic says, Be thy Coming good or bad, not quite so clear. H. H. The Ghost says, according to Shakespear, Confined fast in Fires. According to Mr. Warburton, Confined too fast in Fires. To shew Mr. W. that I can alter as well as himself, nay, and amend his own Edition, behold an Example. O Buckingham, beware of yonder Dog, His venom Tooth will rankle to the Death. Warburton. Q. Margaret, Richard III. Act I. Scene 3. I say it should be. His venom Tooth will rankle thee to Death. Arietta asleep in a Chair, Ghost walks on with a Candle. Ghost. In dismal Ditty, doleful sounding Verse, I'm sent thy Fall, Arietta, to rehearse. (Bell tolls. But hark, the Bellman summons me away, If I had Time, I had much more to say. (Exit. Arietta. (Wakes. Methought I heard a melancholy Tone; Well, from henceforth I'll never lie alone: I was a-dream'd, as how a Ghost was here, My Cap stands right up, and I quake for Fear. (Noise. Oh me, what Noise is that? Oh! 'Squire, 'Squire, 'Squire, 'Squire, 'Squire! In Straw-fill'd Sty, thus have I heard a Swine Sigh for her Mate, for her Companion pine; Send thro' the senseless Pales, her snuffling Groans, Eccho'd by squeaking Pigs in shriller Tones. (Goes to the Door, and shrieks. Enter Capriola, with a Bottle in one Hand, and a Phial in t'other. Capriola. At last she's found, now by my best Brocade, I'll not depart 'till I have sluic'd the Jade Sluic'd the Jade.—It should be, souc'd the Jade. Sluic'd is too indelicate a Word for a fine Lady to make use of. I think it is the Business of every Commentator, to be nice in regulating the Ideas of his Characters, or else we may construe Expressions, put into the Mouths of nice Ladies, to very gross Meanings. Well has Mr. W. shewed us an Example of that, by his Note in King Lear, Act I. Scene 2, Regan says, Which the most precious Square of Sense possesses. On this, he thus judiciously, delicately remarks. By the Square of the Senses, we are here to understand, the four nobler Senses, viz. Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, and Smelling; for a young Lady could not, with any Decency, insinuate, she knew of any Pleasure which the fifth afforded. He is so very nice, in respect of the Senses, that he will not allow them to be pierced. It is not right, he thinks, so he alters a Line in Lear's Curse, From A Father's Curse pierce every Sense about thee, To A Father's Curse pierce every Fence about thee.. (Arietta behind the Skreen. Come forth, thou Wretch, thou Robber of my Right, Think not to skreen thee from thy Rival's Sight Here is a Piece of Wit, which may pass unnoticed by the Reader, if I do not put him in Mind of it: It is this— Think not to skreen thee.—Memorandum, she is gone behind the Skreen.. Arietta. I hear a Voice, coarse as the Fish-Wife's Throat, Whose Sound was loud as those who Flounders cry, As harsh as Sand-Boys, or as Brick-Dust Sellers: Foul-mouth'd Tongue. In As you like it, you may meet with the Word foul. Foul is most foul, being foul to be a Scoffer. This, I believe, is obvious to the meanest Capacity, Homeliness is made worse, if the Ugly pretend to rail at the Deformed. But the Sagacity of Mr. W. renders it, Foul is foul, being found to be a Scoffer. And declares, the Repetition of foul is too absurd to come from Shakespear. Playing upon Words was not Shakespear's greatest Beauty, but it was very much his Practice. Allow me, Reader, to give you a Specimen of Mr. W. playing upon Words himself. He, in his Notes on the Witches of Macbeth, their Charms, and Incantations, says, as extravagant shocking and absurd all this is, the Play has had the Power to charm and bewitch every Audience, from that Time to this. And since I have offered a Specimen of his Humour, give me Leave to exhibit one of his Wit. In the same Play he says, after some Account of the Sun, and its Rays, Optics, &amp;c. a Rainbow is no more a Reflection of the Sun, than a Tune of a Fiddle. Thy foul-mouth'd Tongue, all Billingsgate exceeding, Declares you know not what belongs to Breeding. Capriola. Trollop, I scorn to force Discourse unto ye, But hear, ye Slut, come do as I command ye, Drink me this Bottle off of British Brandy? Drink it all up, or else, by all my Woes, Full in your Face this Aquafortis goes. Be quick, be quick, immediately obey me, I'll mark you else, Miss, tho' the Squire slay me. Arietta. What, wou'd you poison me? Sure, you're but jesting. Capriola. No Words, I charge you; but now pray be tasting. Arietta. Let me conjure you, Madam, pray excuse me? I never wrong'd you, why shou'd you abuse me? I, like fair Rosamond, in Woodstock Bower, Am sacrific'd to Eleanor's fierce Power. Capriola. Not wrong'd me! O thou tinsel trapish Trull, O give me Patience, all ye sheepish dull; Ye hen-peck'd Husbands, and ye oft-kicked Cowards! No rather give me Rage, remorseless Rage, Fill with fell Hate, my Breast ye Prudes disgrac'd, Ye antiquated Toasts, give me your Spleen? Ye Gamesters, Goalers, and ye purse-proud Traders, Give me your merciless stern Minds a Moment? Now, by my Soul, you Jade, unless you drink it, Upon thy white-wash'd Face this Phila flies, Levels thy Nose, and burns out both thy Eyes. Arietta. (Drinks. Oh! oh! oh! I'm in a dismal Pickle. Like a Tetotum, my poor Head is whirling. As School-boys make the giddy Top run round, So reels Arietta 'till she drops to Ground. Enter Squire Fanfly. Fanfly. O Brimstone, thou shalt sleep to Night in Bridewell. Thou Cinder-sifting, dirty, stroling Punk; Oh Arietta—Oh ye Powers—she's drunk. Arietta. I am, indeed; I'm in a sad Condition. Oh! I am sick. What's that which dances by me? Behold, the Tea-Table is all a-float; See Tea-Cups failing, Tea-Spoons turn'd to Oars, Chairs, Night-Gowns, Pillows, Lap-Dogs, Cards, and Counters, Oh! Water, Water, Oh—Oh— (Sleeps. Fanfly. At length she's dumb, her nimble Tongue stands still, Her talking Faculties by Sleep are numb'd, And ev'ry Sound has left her silent Lips. O thou sweet-pleasing Sleep, whose ebon Wand, With drowsy Poppies wreath'd, can slumb'rous charm Ev'n Ladies Tongues, and at thy wond'rous Touch, Silence is fix'd on tattle-loving Fair. Capriola. Since then, to Night, you can't this Lady see, Come, my dear Squire, come along with me? Fanfly. Avaunt, get out, I'd rather see a Tipstaff. Capriola. Yes, I will go, curse on your steady Muscle. Oh! I could hate myself for being kind To savage Man, the only Beast untam'd. Each Brute, from Instinct, feels a separate Taste, But motley-minded Man mimics them all. First, like a Spaniel, fawning, then puts on An Ape's Grimace, and Monkey-like he plays, Sly as the wily Fox, insidious plots, Or rudely rushes, like the Mountain Bull, And all to win poor, weak, defenceless Woman. But when Desire by full Possession's cloy'd, Like secret skulking Moles, they coward hide, Or bray, like stupid Asses, of our Favours. Woman to undeserving Man was given, The last best Gift of ever-bounteous Heaven, Fond, like a Child, at first the Play-Thing pleas'd, But soon, too soon, the self-same Beauty teiz'd; He cries to change, and sighs for other Toys, Ideot-like dotes, or Savage-like destroys: While wretched Woman-kind betray'd, like me, Can only curse the Sex, as I do thee This Tag is in true Tragedy Taste. Here are a Parcel of trite Common Place Similies crouded together, and Half a Dozen Verses at the End, which is on Purpose, that the Heroine may make a graceful Exit. H. H.. (Spits at him, and exit. Fanfly. Put her to Bed, and let's go in to Supper, And, in Despite of Grief, let us be merry This is right. And in Despite of Grief, &amp;c. So Antipholis, in the Comedy of Errors, Act III. Scene 1, says, And in Despite of Wrath, mean to be merry; for he has received several Rebuffs from his Wife, and is resolved to go to another House. And in Despite of her Wrath, be merry. But Mr. W. renders it, And in Despite of Mirth, mean to be merry.. The Sweet-heart thus her bonny Sailor leaves, And yields reluctant to the Wind-rais'd Waves, Turns quick, and views the Vessel with a Fright, Stretching away, and less'ning to her Sight, Sighing, at last she sees it lose the Shore, Then looks, and looks, till she can look no more. A Midnight SCENE. Enter Spunge. Spunge. 'Tis now the Dead of Night; so much the better: Lamp, by your Leave,—shew Light to read this Letter? Honoured Sir, Hoping these Lines in Health will find you well, As I myself am, I make bold to tell, If you, to Night, to our Back-door repair, When it strikes Twelve, you'll surely find one there. Now grizly Night, thy pitch'd Tarpaulin spread, Black as the sooty Chimney-sweeper's Sack; Snore, ye bed-wanting Bunters, on each Bulk; Wake not, ye Watchmen, while I warn my Love, Molly, Miss Molly, O Miss Molly, Molly— But see the Casement opens, she appears, And spreads a sparkling Light along the Lane. Miss. Who's there? Spunge. My dear, 'tis I, your True-love, Spunge. Miss. If I, poor Girl, do trust myself with you, May I depend, Sir, you'll be always true? Spunge. By yon pale greasy Lamp that twinkling burns; By the still Silence of this Tongue-ty'd Night; By this sad Soul that snores, immers'd in Drink— Miss. O, do not swear—I do indeed believe, So sweet a Tongue, sure, never can deceive. Here, take this Bundle? As he takes it, a Noise is heard within, of, Bring him along; the 'Squire is carried across the Stage, and the Watchmen seize Spunge, and carry him off last. SCENE, the Watch-House. Constable asleep, Watch asleep, all asleep All asleep. A fine Instance and Emblem of Tranquillity.. Enter Spunge. 1st Watchman. An please your Honour's Worship, Mr. Constable, I have reprehended an suspicious Fellow, and made bold, as it is my Duty, an it please you, to bring him before your Worship. Constable. Where did you reprehend him? 2d Watchman. Just by, he stood hiding himself as I and my Partner came by, and thought, as how it might be proper to take care of him: Whereby, least he should rob any Body, we took this Bundle from him. Constable. Oh, oh; ay, ay, he's a Thief sure enough, and I know a Thief as well as the Beggar knows his Dish, as the Song says. Come, Sirrah, who are you? Spunge. A Gentleman. Constable. Yes, yes, you shall be hang'd like a Gentleman This is quite in Nature: For it is common for an inferior Officer of Justice to sentence every Man who is brought before him; to drole on the Distresses of his Looks, or his Dress, and to make him out a Rogue by the Force of Physiognomy.. What's your Name? Spunge. Spunge. Constable. Spunge! Oh, Mr. Spunge, you shall be squeez'd dry enough before we have done with you. (A great Laugh. 1st Watchman. Ay, Master Constable's a parlous Man at a Joke. And how came you by that Bundle, Sirrah? Did not you steal it? Spunge. No, Sir? Constable. No, Sir; no, Sir. But I say Yes, Sir, you did, Sir, and you'll be hang'd, Sir. Here's a Rogue for you, first robs, and then denies it; telling me, his Majesty's Representative, a Lye to my Face. But now you shall hear how I'll prove him a Rogue: First and foremost, as I said before, he must be a Rogue, because he denies it, for that's always the Trick of a Rogue: Next, he must be a Rogue, because, at this Time, all honest People shou'd be in Bed: And lastly, he must be a Rogue, because—because— Who did you belong to, Sirrah? What Complices have you? Spunge. I belong to 'Squire Fanfly. 1st Watchman. O! he's gone to Bedlam; they carried him away To-night. Spunge. If he is mad, then I'm indeed undone. Farewel the noble Treats, the nimble Race, The eager Cockings, and all studious Whist; No more shall I, the well-wax'd Cork unscrew: Who'll now the noisy Dun's tumultuous Voice, With Pill-Peruvian stop? Constable. Carry him into the next Room, while we consult about him. Now, Neighbours, as you were saying, the 'Squire was mad, I am a saying, this Man is mad also. D'ye hear how he talks about a Cock and a Bull? So ye that took him shall carry him to Bedlam, and I'll take Care of the Bundle, and deliver it to the right Owner, when I can find one, and so let Justice take Place, and good Morrow all.—Break up the Watch. SCENE the last. BEDLAM. Enter the 'Squire's Mamma, and Phlebotome. Mamma. Sir, tho' you have my Son, yet pray be gentle, Let him be mildly brought again to Reason. Phlebotome. Madam, will it please you, stand by, and observe him, You then shall see my Method, and no Doubt, You will approve the Medicines I prescribe. (A Noise is heard within, of Singing, ratling Chains, Roaring, &amp;c. Enter a Lady. Lady. Your Grace's most devoted, my Lord, your humble; pray let me see you at my Drum Tonight; there will be Miss Rout, Madam Racquet, Lady Hurricane, and the Dutchess of Helter-Skelter. Mamma. Pray, who is this? Phlebotome. A kept Mistress, who run mad because a Tradesman's Wife took the Wall of her. Damn the Dutch, I say. (Within. Phlebotome. O! here comes the Dancing-Master: He lost his Senses studying Politics. Enter Dancing-Master. Dancing-Master. I say, Sir, the Dutch can't dance, Sir. For, suppose, Sir, now all the Princes in Europe at an Assembly, the Queen of Hungary opens the Ball, and the King of Prussia puts her out. The French figure in and out just as they please; the Dutch don't dance, Sir, but keep serving every Body with Tea and Coffee. Phlebotome. What do the English do, Sirrah? Dancing-Master. Oh, oh, the English—Why they pay the Fidlers. Enter Shoemaker. Shoemaker. I'll pay no Body, Sir, I'm for Liberty and Property, and damn all Taxes. Phlebotome. This was a mad Shoemaker; his Skull was crack'd at an Election. Shoemaker. Huzza, Liberty for ever—and Old England always. Friends and Fellow-Craft, I am come among you to promote Peace and good Neighbourbood, and I'll knock any one down that dares deny it. It's Time that all Taxes were made an End of, for before Taxes, every poor Man was as good as a Lord; we could have Liquor for nothing, and Meat without Money. Therefore, I say, no Taxes. Enter Gamester. Gamester. I say, done to you. Phlebotome. This is a Gamester; he run mad after Religion. Gamester. What's the most Odds against a Man's going to Heav'n? Enter Barber. Barber. The World wants Shaving. Phlebotome. This is a Barber's 'Prentice, who run mad with Metaphysics. Gamester. What's the most Odds a Man goes to Heaven? Barber. Heaven is immaterial, abstracted from infinite Space; for the World lies in the Clouds, as a Wash-Ball in a Bason of Suds: Therefore, Gravitation's consider'd as a Predicament of Matter, by the same Parity of Reason. Gamester. What's the most Odds against a Man's going to Heaven? Shoemaker. Sirrah, you are a Placeman; you want to make Int'rest at Court, Sirrah. Enter Poet. Poet. And rumbling, grumbling, and I'm cold and queer. Phlebotome. O! this is the Poet; his Play was damn'd, and he ran mad upon it. Poet. This Play, Sir, is call'd, The Deluge. It opens with a Soliloquy of one of Noah's Sons, who is lamenting the Loss of his Perriwig, which was spoil'd in the Rain. Now does the rumbling Thunder rend the Sky, And crawling Caterpillars trembling fly. Now purring Cats the nimble Mice pursue, And boneless Ghosts turn twinkling Candles blue. The Light'ning flashes, thro' the fiery Clouds, Scare the bold Titan's, and all Homer's Gods, And while the Combat lasts, all Heaven's at Odds. Gamester. I'll take the Odds, I say done first. Enter Squire Fanfly. Mamma. O my poor Child, my Fanfly! Fanfly Who's that calls? O, my Mother! Is it you? O let me out, Release me from this Wretchedness, I'll promise To offend no more; no more with Rakes to run, But live your loving, your obedient Son. Mamma. Come to my Arms, my rash, unthinking Child, And let me fold ye. Thus the cackling Hen, When the stray Chicken's found, with joyful Clucks, The tender Nurseling laps beneath her Wing. Fanfly. Farewel all Drinking, and the Joys of Love, By all the Gods, to study I'll remove; I'll live by Book, and learn to think by Rule, And quite forget that I was once a Fool. Phlebotome. Well, since you both so well agree, This is a Day of Jubilee; Ye mad Inhabitants advance, And, like yourselves, leap up a Dance. DANCE. FINIS.</field>
