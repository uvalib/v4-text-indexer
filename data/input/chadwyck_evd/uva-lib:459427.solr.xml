      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Crab the young Heir, Goodwit, and Dick the Falconer. Goodw. Come Mr. Crab, tell me how you do like The glory of the City, and the States Adorn her. Say, is she bely'd by Fame, Above the truth of wonder and delight. Crab. Faith 'tis a brave place; what dost thou say Dick? Dick. You know the rich complexion of my nose Could ne're abide the sent of Countrey aire; It doth infect our Reason, and inspire Brutish and earthy spirits: but tell us now, Where dwell these gentle girles, those coming things? Crab. 'Death. I forgot my self; yfaith I'le see Them presently. Y. Good. Sir, you are yet to learn That this fair City is a heaven on earth; Each beauty is a star, which moves unknown To those who want the skill to shew where they Do rise and set, and where appear at noon; Which wander, which are fixt the wandring star Keeps not one sign ever, but what is now In Virgo, or the sign of maiden-head, May before long be seen in Gemini. Dick. Faith I do think the maiden-head a signe To all call'd Shees, before that they have dwelt Three years i'th tender teenes; a signe I mean, Barely without the thing Y. Go. How old I pray Was your dear mother then, when you were got; If she call'd you her heir. Dick. Sir, I am call'd Her heir apparent, though I'me not my fathers: He was a Knight they say, my mother was A circumstance of my good Ladies chamber, Who at fifteen, for better and for worse, Was to the Falc'ner put for to be mann'd; When his good Master did it to his hand. 'Twas said I came 3. months before my time, Yet had I Dad's n'own nose, n'own eyes, and forehead too; Though 'twas too narrow for his fair attiring. But I am counted of the Falc'ner's airy, Who train'd me up in his own learned skill. Y. Goodw. That is to lure and ly. Crab. What's this toth'Wenches? Y. Goodw. Sir, I was shewing they were wandring starres Alwayes in motion; but their Caterer Will soon direct me, whom I'me sure to find At an old countreyman's of his, who sells Fierce aguardienty and tobacco. Dick. Pray sir whats he you call their Caterer? Goodw. He's one who makes provision for the belly; Squire of the Placket, he who in elder times Was free of this deep secret mysterie. By the black Character on's Pagan face; And his unchristned sword was easily known. But nowâ Crab. No more Sir, of these dreadfull sights, Their shadows will affright me in my dreames. Goodw. For your sweet comfort Sir, the thin I mean: Is a tame beast, yclep'd Captain Hog; One that's so gentle, you may boldly stroke him The courteous kick to him's a friendly greeting The whip a pleasing titillation; The bastinado is his dear delight. The grand disgust adort, and the aggravio, He suffers with a Captain's grand couragio. Crab. Yfaith I love this Captain horribly; I long to greet him with my courteous heel, To bore his nose, and thankfully requite His noble kindnesse with his dear delightâ O bravely rythm'd yfaith! now do I think How the Gallants will hugg me all, and call me The noble spark of Sussex: in the countrey The people there will point at me, and say. That's he that beat the Captain Sirrah, you Remember to report my brave atchievements. Dick. O, fear not Sir; I warrant you I'le sing Your praises most Poetically; swear You worsted Captain Peek at 15. weapons. Goodw. What wilt thou say thy Master fought a prize? Dick. I mean that to the field he challeng'd him At twenty weapons, came off clear at all. Without a scratch or seat; then I will shew, How drinking with another Captain, you Did tweak him by th'nose about the room, And make him hold your most victorious stirrup Goodw. What must his horse then keep him company? Dick. Sir, I do now omit, how searching then His Captainship, faces about, he did Eject him with disgrace into the street; Where 'twas my luck to hold my Master's steed, That the Soldado might perform my task. Crab. Gramercy Dick yfaith; this shall be worth A copie-hold to thee, yfaith la. Dick. Thanks, good Sir, but will the Captain Caterer Take the battoon so kindly; I ne're thought Patience a Souldier's virtue untill now Running away, and patientnesse did come I do believe, in fashion both together. Goodw. Troth Falconer thou hast flown the truth toth'mark. But this procurer is indeed no Captain, Onely he serv'd one, rob'd of his outside; And where he was not known, usurpt't the name. Crab. Though I came hither for to see the Wenches, Yet I will beat this Captain first; you shall Intreat me hold my hands, and beg my pardon; Make us both friends in Sack, and ever after We'le love like children and be bed-fellows. Dick. This is his life at home, kissing his maids, Bearing his men, which must not strike again. Come shew's some Girles, for I do know my Master Fain would give his cod piece-points to beat her. Good. Come follow me I warrant you I'le shew You game enough, but do not you turn taile. Crab. How! not turn tail? why wherefore come we hither; But let's alone, I warrant you Il'e towze And mowze them too. Goodw. So so then, come away. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Derrick and Shift. Der. Make me beholding to you, Sir I pray, To let me know who did direct you to me: Shift. Let my thanks wait upon your pardon, Sir; He's one that's in your debt, and happily Would not be known to send a second debtor. Der. Faith if you come to borrow, yon mistake; And I am richer then I thought my self, If any man be in my debt. Shift. I mean, no debt of money, but of happinesse, And rich content in the unvalued blessing Of a sweet, loving, beauteous, virtuous wife. Der. 'Tis possible, though I think our trade Is laden more with curses then with prayers. Shift. Of what occupation then do you Style your self free. Der. Faith of the dealing trade, We are call'd Merchants of the Maidenhead: Though often I confesse we do put off Frail ware instead of whole, that's nought to us: Caveat emptor; we do promise onely, For the outwards, do you mark me, for the Outwards alone; as if some youthfull Gallant, (Suppose your self) should now desire my grave Experience to direct him to a Wife That's fair and rich, and young. I am resolv'd If I present him with these properties; I do professe no skill in med'cine Sir; And tis above my skill to know, who at Fifteen do make maid's water, and who not; Who have a worm breeding i'th'tongue, who eat Musk comfits when they kisse whom secret Ills Molest, which none but mother midnight knowes. Shift. Leave these to my discovery, if she Be young and fair, and rich, (but chiefly rich,) That drug shall cure her other Ills beyond The skill of charming Grandam Water-witch. Der. He who profest himself so much in debt To my direction, might have made you know The clime where my intelligence doth reign Which Kents-dike bounds upon the East, the West Is by the river Arun limited; The North by an imaginary line, The South is by the Sea confin'd; within This round what beauties shine, my skil can shew Their number and degrees, now I do breathe Within a forrain air. Shift. He gave me then To know as much, nor is it my desire To have my blisse thrown in my armes: I'le travail For it meet it, or pursue it flying; Only lend me your aid. Der. Sir, what I lend I nere exact agen, onely I take My Interest before-hand; but yet first Besides your goodly person which I'le make Your Mistress doat upon before she sees, Let me know how I shall report you else, Your name, wealth, countrey, birth and parentage, What Joynture? Shift. I have that will please a woman; Send me to one has power to dispose Of her own outwards, as you use to call um; I have my self that shall deserve her, and An active brain to boot, shall win her too. Der. Pray give me leave to tell your fortune, Sir. Shift. Read me a good one then. Der. Good as the starres Will yeild; in whose decrees you are inrol'd, An English younger brother, whose Estate Consists in his annuity and wit: The starres do tell me your annuity Is sold, and that your wits are roming after. Shift. After what romes my wit? Der. After your tongue. Which romes before your wit; would any man Whose words were usher'd in with knowledge say, He'd win a wife by his good parts alone? Shift. Rich men like crafty knaves do need no broakers; Had I but land and gold, I'de never seek To your grave wisdome for direction: But to be short, enrich me with a wife, And claim an equall share in all my fortunes. Der. I think that face would tempt a lustie widow Shift. He that doth woo a widow hunts the winde, They are too oft gone over to be caught By younger Brothers, they have learnt a trick To cheat the elder now; besides I would Not go a beaten road Der. Last night I heard Newes from my Diocesse, that the great Heir Of Sir Iohn Crab lately deceas'd, is straid With one who calls himself a traveller, I'th'absence of a carefull uncle, whom, His brother left a Guardian to his Child. Shift. The traveller hath married her by this I warrant you: Der. What married the Heir male Shift. What's the Heir male to me? Der. Il'e shew you Sir, He has a sister. Shift. I let's hear of her. Der. Her Father living fear'd that she did love A Gentleman, whose Father's land he bought; He being sick, with tears besought his brother He would not this slip of fruitlesse race Ingrafted in his stock, and by his prayers Doth with a promise of his faithfull care; This uncle (sayes my news) intends a quest Of his lost Ward, arriv'd as he doth hear Out of the countrey in this little world Of London. Shift. I do apprehend the rest; That as the traveller enric'd away The Nephew, his Guardian being absent; So I should steal away the Neece, while he Seeks for the Nephew. Der. Still your tongue prevents Your wit. His trusty Huntsman he hath sent before To purchase fair &amp; specious lodgings, meaning To shew his Neece the City Shift. Heard you not My nose crack Sir, I feel it out of joint Already: for if she do see the City, Musk-millions of rich gallants will besiege Her Fort, and my cake's dowe. Der. Rye dowe to make Your Image on, to be the Ideot's Idol. What does your active brain, your worthy self Despair? fear not, she shall not dwell so long I'th'town, nor her acquaintance be so cheap To every cringer, but believe me I Am poor in leisure now, see me again Twixt twelve and one, till then adieu, 'Farewel. Exit Derick Shift. This fellow though he be no Doctor, yet Expects a Fee; the silver key, if my True friend belyes him not, Not onely his intelligence but makes him Swear nothing by the year to thousands: well If hope will please him, so, he gets no hire 'Till he deserve it; the old fox may cheat, And 'tis a science in Ordinaries preacht, Equal to lending to be over-reacht. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter young Friendly and Phyllis. Friend. Sister we are not poor, my bare annuity Will keep's alive; and had we less, content Ill make us rich, if our confin'd desires Wish only to be what we are, they want No wealth, who disregard it; those who ask Our daily almes do shew that we are rich, If we could think so, and compare our state With theirs, who have to give, cannot be poor. Phil. Not poor? what's a bare hundred pound a year? Not half the tithe of what my father sold. Friend. He who desires no more then what's enough, Borrows from smaller, and from greater summs With equal joy; he who doth drink no more Then will extinguish thirst, is pleas'd as well With a small spring as with a swelling stream. And were we stript of all, of all forlorn; There's none can be so poor as he was born. Phil. Our want with this Philosophy doth well Agree; but yet I hope your constancie Will yield it a far lesse uneasie task To commend poverty, then suffer it. Friend. Not so, for Wit is heaven's gift to those Are shapt of purer clay; but patience Each noble mind bestowes upon it self. Phil. Brother, I must confesse my miserie The lesse, by your example of a just And worthy scorn of Fortune's injuries. But the rich blessing of Elisa's love Doth sweeten your calamities, while I Wanting inviting Dowrie, may receive Unwelcome praises for my Chastity: A virtue now clean worn out of fashion, Though few commend their abstinence from meat, Who fall because they have not what to eat. Friend. The hopes of my Elisa did expire, When for a legacie her dying rather Doom'd my evilement from her blessed sight: But he can ne're divorce our soules, last night Her heavenly shape in a most lively dream Shadow'd my fancie; I then saw, or thought I saw but sure I saw the Queen of Love Give her a milky Dove, fellow to that She sold to her Anacreon for a hymne, From which she borrow'd instantly a quill, With which she writ such lines of love, the words Distilling Ioy, as if they flowed from A pen that's snatcht from Cupid's wing; she folds, And seales the letter with a bleeding heart. The witnesse of the truth She writ, and then First superscribing it, To her best friend Friendly; she gav't her winged messenger To bear, when swelling joy lab'ring for room, Dissolv'd my sleep, and (as the Poet sings) I wak't, and so all this was but a dream. Phil. Thus the Idea of the Saint which loves And honours you, presents it self both day And night to banish carefull thoughts: but Iâ Friend. Complain not sister that you are forsaken; You told me fortune blest you with the sight, Where you last summer'd, of the wealthy Heir Who lords it now in my inheritance, Who swort by's Grandsire's and his Grandam's Saint, He lov'd you dearly. Phil. He did swear indeed, But so rustically. Friend. I never heard Of a Court fashion yet in Swearing. And besides the Proclamation forbids it: Unlesse he'le bestow his Charity on the poor a new way. But you must give me leave to tell you sister, Your carriage tow'rds him, Ill became your fortune, That when the land your father sold was thrown Into your lappe, so proudly you refuse it; Nor was Elisa's brother worthy scorn. Phil. What would you have me marrie with a fool? Friend. Great ladies now keep things with baubles sister, And you may teach him wit and manners too; And win a fame for bringing up a husband. Phil. 'Tis sin against a woman's modestie, To appear yeilding at the first assault: But if young Crab do woo again, although Of an Ill name, he shall not want a glance. Enter Dove. Dove. My old young Master, and my sweet young Mistress. Give me your gollsâthese are the sweetest kisses I had since I did see you last. Friend. Tom Dove welcome to th'town. Phil. This may be Venus Dove, And then the dream is out. Dove. You do not dream, I am indeed Tom Dove, your father's Huntsman; Who with his land for an appurtenance Bequeath'd me to the next new Master, I Am now of counsel to the fair Elisa, Who in this letter sends you newes and comfort. Friend. O my presaging thoughts, do I now wake? Or did I then but dream? the seale agrees Kisses the Seal. On which I thus and thus do taste, and seal My Ioy, e're I can mask my happinesse. Dove. O Mistress, my young Master sings your praises Most melodiously, he holds the fish, Your beauty did make water in his mouth. Phyl. Fie Thomas, don't bely you Mistresse manners. Dove. I mean that you did make this mouth to water. And when he came late home, he did nothing But sing and caper, and caper and sing I'le give away my lambes, and sell away my dammes To Tuppe with an Ewe so bonny. Phyl. Well let him keep his sheep's head to himself, And I will keep my maiden head. But what Are the effectual ingredients Of your amazing Letter, which do work So strangely with my brother. Dove. There is that, Will moisten his mouth too, something to purge His melancholy, and make the heart dance. Friend. Elisa and her uncle coming up So suddenly! Dove. I do believe they are Arriv'd by this, two dayes are since expir'd He receiv'd news, his lodgings were provided; Which time my idle care hath burnt away In buying knacks and toyes for your sweet Mistresse And her appendix, though my first charge was To visit you, but I do hope.â Friend. Your pardon Timely prevents your suit, but yet the losse Of her wise brother doth amaze me, how Think you to hunt him out? my advice is To winde thy Horn about the town, he knowes The summons. Dove. Therefore he'le not appear. Besides, The Citizens may take it to themselves; And I may pull the heard about my eares. Phyl. Indeed I think him creeping in the horn Already; if he be not soon reclaimed, The Gallant hath a most becoming face To grace the lesser end. Friend. Come leave your flouting. Tom, when your newes hath received thanks within. Then take your leave to wait your Master's coming. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Old Goodwit, Elisa, and Winifred. Old Goodw. Neece, your are welcome to the Theatre Of fond delights, the schoole of vanitie; Where various sights seduce the gazer's eye: There to be good where nothing tempts to ill, Is a faint virtue of the weakest mindes, This is a place will try your Constancie; Where if it stand unshaken being assail'd, As it stood firm where there was nought to shake it; Though you do not increase your store of virtue. Yet you shall purchase glorie in reserving Those graces which were lov'd, admir'd at home. Elisa. Sir, paying first the thanks which my dutie owes Your loving care, my promise shall secure Your fear, who am the Mistress of a heart Shall stand unshaken as a rock, against The furie of the waves, amidst that Sea Of which (they say) Venus her self was born. Old Goodw. I will not sinne against the soul of goodnesse, In doubting yours. Daughter you have a fair Example, let your imitation Wait on her virtues. Win. Sir, I took her for My guide, since I first follow'd her, and am A servant to her worth, and your commands. Old Goodw. You shall do well, my man hath taken fair And spacious lodgings for us. I do wonder They could not hold him to expect our coming. If he flie out, and my tame Dove prove wilde, I'le clip his wings; my neece and daughter, I Must provide questers to retrive the stray. If in my absence Dove return, let him Know who's displeas'd, and why. Elisa. Uncle he shall. Old Goodw. And heare you, Win? forget not you your charge. Exit. Win. My care is ever servant to your will. Elisa. Come Cousin, let me hear this secret charge. Win. You do not long I hope. Elisa. Not for ripe cherries In winter, or for oysters in the dog daies: But I must tast this secret. Win. I believe The relish will displease, but now I think on't. Last night I had the sweetest dream, me thoughtâ Elisa. I will not give a farthing for your thought; What task was that my uncle charg'd you with? Win. Then I'le disclose what I did mean to keep Close as my maidenhead; a sweet young gallant Catching my work, did feel his wantonnesse Reveng'd with my sharp needle, on which chance He writ such piteous verses in the bloud Which my Steeletto drew; t'wod grieve your heart To hear his sad laments, he finely swore My little Instrument was Cupid's dart, And though the god were blind, his darts could see, Therefore he said my needle had an eye: Then he protested the bloud wherewith he writ Came from his heart, which he did call the spring Of Love and Sorrow. Elisa. Cousin you are unkinde, To cheat me with delayes; your father did Appoint me your example: when I pray Did you finde me a niggard of my thoughts? Are you not conscious of all my secrets, As if you dwelt within me; I love not This nicenesse, but if needs we must be strangersâ Win. Pray heaven I have not gotten you with childe, I'me sure you have no other bed-fellow. Elis. Yes Win, I have; whom might I once embrace, A man of rich desert. Win. Benedicite! a man lie with us, and I feel him not? Elis. You oft have known me name my servant Friendly, 'Tis he I mean, his virtues dwell with me: And the blest shape enshrines them to my thoughts Is ever present; you have seen his tokens, Heard our loves first beginning, but now youâ Win. No more, if you'l be ignorant of nothing, Prepare your eares to hear unwelcome newes; My charge is to preserve you from the sight Of him you daily see, who nightly lies With you, your Friendly; whom my father hears To be in town, and fears you'l find a way To let him know of yours; my office is To intercept his visit. Elis. Will you then Prove traitor unto love? Cousin beware, His godhead will revenge your treacherie; But yet you know him not: if he should act Our tailor's man, or bring us women's knacks To sell, how would your skill discover him? Win. My father told me of a mole he had By his right eye, that signe will betray him. Elis. That mole was given by the god of love; Who lighting once a taper at his eye, The bashfull Lad putting it by, receiv'd That ornament which Cupid cauteriz'd; Who unto those who wear his livery Will be propitious in their worthy Loves. Win. May he have fortune equal to his wish; And if you can devise a way to see him, And I not forfeit my obedience, My aid shall not be wanting. Elis. Now I am Restor'd: I will go studie, he shall act Some new adventure to advance our hope Shall shame times past, instruct the time to come. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Derrick. Der. I do suspect that I do wait at home For some poor needy Gallant, whose estate Consists in his good clothes, a handsome face, And a clean leg to boot; I did forget To ask his name, but I do swear it is Unworthy of my knowledge; if he passe His hour, he shall finde my word is cancell'd. Enter Shift. Shift. I've justly kept my time Sir. Der. Then time cannot Say you have kept her ill. Shift. And time keeps me as well. For I do live extempore. Der. I have been looking o're my list, to fit Your turn; which doth contain of maids fourscore, Between 15. and five and twenty, three From thence to 30. after which time, they Are counted maides of the Religion. Shift. Pray Sir let's see this map of Maiden-heads. Der. For my own memorie I'le produce it; I did describe my contemplations For my own use, and not for others study. I must put on my seeing instruments, For to survey this land of Amazons. puts on his Spectacles Shift. I fear you do see double with those eyes, And may mistake 2. thousand pound for one. Pray look for me the most alluring outwards. Der. I shall, the first Region comprehends The maiden beautie, call'd Virginis: And this is thought to be a fertile land, Now onely wanting the good husband's tillage. Shift. That should not want, were I it's Governour. Der. To each my sure experience hath affixt Their portion, feature, age, their birth and breeding. This other side I have design'd for Widows, Called by some the Island of Japan, A rich and open countrey; though some think 'Tis not the sweetest air; this is divided 'Mongst Widows of the first, second and third head, The portion of which last is counted barren. Shift. But there are Widows of more heads then three. Der. True, but my page doth fill with none but those Which are in danger, Sir, of Matrimony. Those of the fourth head solace may themselves On what is past, and with their toothless gumms Chew on the pleasures of their youth, but few Can grace 5. fingers with five wedding-rings. And the example of the wife of Bath Is in my reading singular. Shift. I see That your inquisitive experience Hath left a blank for more discoveries. Der. A wight did come to me for help, As you do now, did finde my other map, and writ Terra incognita in the emptie space. Shift. What's that I pray? Der. That's land undiscovered, Which doth invite us unto farther search. Shift. But there are some unmarried, neither maids Nor widows, are all such Utopians In your Geographie? Der. If you desire One that's so qualifi'd, I'le fit you too. Shift. No Sir, I onely did desire to know Their place and order in your table. Der. These Are registred alone in my black book; Of these my Diocesse doth yeild but few, And those transplanted to the city first, Thence sent unto the place from whence they came. Shift. Pray Sir instruct me fully in your table; What mean those lines are drawn hither from thence? Right and oblique, to and again, much like The picture of a ship. Der. Where I am known, They call't my ship; for on the welcome Eve Of Valentine, once every year, I draw My Table new; then I expunge those names Belong not to my office, and adopt new. When unto those complain of want of wives, They use to say that Derrick's ship's come home. Shift. But for the lines. Der. These I may rightly call Lines of proportion, which do point you out The equal matches in the ods of portion. Shift. I understand you not. Der. As for example, This oblique line drawn from the letter I Annext unto a maid that's fair and young, Whose whole estate is but an hundred pound; And ending in the letter O prefixt Unto a widow of the second head That's valu'd at a thousand, doth demonstrate These matches Geometrically even. Shift. Trust me your Schemes most mathematically Exact and curious: but I pray demonstrate A true proportion in the difference Of Dowrie' twixt the maids Der. This doth appear In these lines which are perpendicular; As thus, the line which falls from the same I, Upon the letter T, annext unto A maid that wants an eye, and Elder by Ten years, though she exceed 9. hundred pound, Doth shew the Matches most exactly equal. Sh. Give me old one ey'd I with her full weight, Then young I with two eyes, so much too light; Let's hear a reason of your confident Assertion. Der. Suppose their age were equal, T five years younger, and I five years elder; Divide nine hundred into equal parts, Fiftie, besides four hundred in a part. Tis the worse two hundred for the want Of her one eye, adde hereunto five years You did substract. and she is worth two hundred And fiftie more, there you have half the summe; From I deduce five years, and count her eye Into the match, and the whole summ's abated. Shift: Somewhat obscure, but yet I apprehend. Five years Increase can make a wife the cheaper By one in five, then an eye wanting can. Der. Most righteous truth. O age, age, age in women; 'Tis their chief fear, because the scorn of men. Shift. And which in all your List wish you me to Der. Faith here is one, if you could like her nose; She's rich enough. Shift. What ailes her nose? Der. There growes A mole upon't so like a bunch of grapes. That if you love um you can scarce forbear The tasting, when her mother was with child With her, long'd for grapes, at the first minute Some smell disliking her, she stopt her nose; And this they say's the cause: but 'tis time I Put up my pipes. This Gentleman is needy. Shift. Good Sir, before you case, let's see the place Of her you said was coming to the City. Der. She with her uncle, as I hear's arriv'd; She's my Inprimis, nineteen years her age, Her Dowrie full 500. pounds a year, Besides her plate and jewels. Shift. Good Sir inform me, Where's her lodging? Der. In my pocket now. Make me beholding to you for your name, Before we part. Shift. My name doth call me Shift. Der. It truly calls you then, a cleanly Gentleman, I shall report you so. Farewell. Shift. Nay Sir. We'le greet in Sack before we part, I owe A greater debt to your discourse that wine Vnlocks his breast, but shall my wits refine. Ex. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Goodwit, Hog, Crab, Falconer. Goodw. Captain, how fare the Ladies of the Lake? Your Mistresses by the Thames side, those Syrens, Whose beautie and enchanting voice invite The heedlesse passenger, do they reside At their old shade? or have they chang'd their shore? Hog. To shame the devil, their dilapidation Hath made them stand in need of reparation: They are now in reedifying Sir. Goodw. What new ware have you then come in, you dare Commend to an old friend or a new: will give The highest price. Hog. Sir I have fresh and new, Was never yet broke up to see the Sun, My good old Mistress Neece, one newly wean'd From milking, and who hath not yet forgot To rise betimes i'th'morning, she is now Learning to swear and talk bawdy, poor fool; I never saw a worse proficient: But she is dear, she must not yet fall down Vnto the hackney price. Goodw. Let thy old Mistress Know, I have seen the Indies since I saw her, And brought home gold untry'd, survey that Gallant, He is a man of gold. Hog. Of gold untry'd, You mean. Falcon. The Captain doth abuse you Sir, You hear him say, your mettal is untry'd: Let his eares feel the valour he suspects. Crab. His looks are too Captainical for me, They kill at least a mile before he's seen; Thou know'st that I am mercifull, for once I'le pardon him, tell him my elemencie. Falc. Yes, with a witness; Captain, or Captain not, Know that my Master's of approved might; He slew the Sussex dragon in the field. Good. Put in, without an Allegorie too. Falc. I know not what your Allegories mean, But I am sure he slew him; yet I see Him couch his conquering lance against the beast, Which now with many doublings doth advance His speckled belly 'gainst the hardy Knight; I'le leave the rest unto a Poet's quill. Hog. A Poet's fiction merits no belief. Fal. This is a storie, and you must believ't; The skin of the foul fiend is to be seen In his great hall, would make the bloud recoil Out of your meazeled face, think you I lye? Crab. O do not anger him; indeed 'tis true, I dare not in the dark pass through my hall, For fear of seeing it. Good. The Captain shall, Believe the wonder, and report it too. Falc. 'Tis his best way; this is his eleventh labour, And this wild boar shall be the twelfth, if he Injure his valour with the least suspition. Hog. Il'e not believe upon compulsion neither; But for the Senior Don Francisco's sake, I will embrace his worth. Crab. O by no means, My worth loves no embracing, I shall ne're Abide that look, Dick. Falc. Then't shall not offend you, Hogs face about. Hog. Dog's face come out, I will Not turn my back for thee not Hercules. Good. Nay then I see we must arrest his armes, Captains should teach their souldiers to obey By their example. Crab. Good Senior hold him fast, Awake my sleeping courage, now I come, My courteous valour greets the Captain's bum. He kicks him. Good. I fear you'l beat a hole into his drum. Falc. 'Tis good to remove the cold rheums from's stomack; But I believe the physick doth not work; He spits for't, give him tother dram. Hog. My stomack's not so cold, but this foul wrong Hath soon inflam'd it; shall the noble race Of Boca di la porca be disgraced, And suffer with an asses patience? Falc. Divorce your hand, good Captain, from your hilt, Or with his breath he'l blow you into Atomes. Hog. I care not for his strongest blasts, he'l find The Hog foreseeing can prevent the wind. Crab. For once I'le buy your patience with a Fee, Nay keep your distance, for this price you shall Report that I subdu'd your stubbornness To my subjection, and did make you yeild Your slavish neck to my insulting heel. Hog. I will proclaim your bounty, equal to Your valour Sir, and both superlative. This shall buy sacrifice for good S. Crispin, St. Martin's play-fellow, this day is his; The night to Crispianus is design'd. Crab. Is this day Crispin's, and I not know it? Frolick my hearts, this day is my birth day; I do remember't very well, between The houres of twelve and one i'th'afternoon, That's about this time, I'me about one &amp; twenty: Here's chink for to buy sacrifice, we'le make A merry night for Crispianus sake. Good. You now like a new Officer should shew Your power, this one and twenty'th Crispin should Heighten your thoughts, &amp; infuse new designs, To make your servants and your tenants know They now are subject to a new Lord &amp; Master. Crab. And well remembred: Dick, you said you spi'd My uncle here in town, no matter what His business is, but you shall take my horse and Ride to my Farm i'th'wild, command my Baily To sell a hundred weathers, but be sure You bring the money instantly. Falc. Before that he hath sold em, he will never do't. Besides, he feares your uncle. Crab. I will send My uncle and him both packing, if they Displease me, here's my Father's seal, go write And I'le subscribe, make haste, the moon doth shine; I do not mean to sleep 'till thy return. Fal. Let not my slowness make you loose your sleeps; But if I fail, blame sunne, or the knave baily. Exit. Good. When you are ready you know where to find us. Crab. Captain, you shall not see the gentle craft This night; I'le be your Saint, and banish Crispin And Crispianus from the Calendar. Hog. Sir by your leave, a Crab must first be boy'ld. Before he can be written in red letters. Good. He's written in red letters there already, St. Sol in Cancer is his holiday, Crab. Well, leave your scoffing; when we have dispatch't This Embasie, we'l burn away the day, And night to boot, in wenching, drink, &amp; play. Goodw. The thought of one and twenty hath transhap't him; This humour doth become you, let it not cool, Who's chaste and sober now, is thought a fool. Exeunt. Enter Elisa and Dove. Elisa. How? you a lawyer, that is very strange. Dove. Truer then strange, I'me sure I've spent my Fee, Before that I have made my motion, Elisa. What motion mean you? Dove. That's a strange thing, You must be Judge too. Elis. That is nothing strange, 'Tis long agoe since I knew how to judge 'Twixt one that weighs his words and he which speaks What others nor himself doth understand. Dove. My meaning's that my motion's unto you. Elis. 'Tis very likely then that you shall speed. Dove. Nay but I shall not, and besides I will not. El. You are an honest Lawyer to your Client. Dove. Honest as any Lawyer of them all. Els. But what's the motion? Dove. 'Tis for a suter. Elis. And what's his sute? Dove. Your humble Orator Desires a hearing in the Chancery of Cupid. Elis. He's a fool, for love doth keep No court of conscience, but for your sake His sute shall be no sooner heard then ended; But now in earnest say who is this suter? Dove. 'Tis not an hour since the old Placket-broaker Our neighbour Derrick sends for me to a tavern. Commends the worth of a young Gallant to me: Who worthily bestow'd the pains to lay Him fast asleep; this Gallant is my Client; If Derrick lyes not, he can easily spend Two hundred pound a month. Elis. 'Tis no great skill. To spend a thousand, e're since I was 13. This knave hath talk't of sending sutors to me, But when's this day of hearing? Dove. Instantly, Soon as his Barber can wash in sope, And wring him, firk up his forehead, hight him And dight him, point his beard, excite his wit; Have at you then yfaith. Elis. I am prepar'd; O the mysterious arts, and wayes of love! While others with unmanly care do plume Their starched looks, to bait the heedless eye; My Friendly to atchieve his hopes, must take A shape that's loath'd and fearfull in their eyes, Who know not what's conceal'd in the disguise. Dov. How Mistress? these are miseries indeed. Elis. Thomas, you know Venus hath sign'd my love With her own seal, to know him if he stray. Dove. His mole you mean. Elis. You guesse aright, my uncle Discover'd to my cousin Win this mark, Which must exclude him from my sight, or she Forfeits a father's blessing; therefore he Shall serve me in a Blackamoor's disguise. Dove. I apprehend the rest, that be my care; This is my Client knocks, I will reture. knockt within. El. Be within hearing you may take him. If that the siege be hot, or last too long. Enter Shift. Dove. Sir you are welcome, Venus prosper you. Shift. Ladie, I have brought a servant to you, sent By one whose wishes gladly wait on yours. Elis. Sir, let me beg your pains, to carry back His gift with thanks, which do attend his care. Shift. Sweet do not stain your beauty with a sinne, To scorn the offer'd presence of a friend. Elis. If you do think me haughty or ingrate, I'le not unlade you Sir of your opinion; You have free leave to carry hence that burden. Shift. I would not, fair one, carry hence your scorn, Which doth oppresse me with a heavy load; Rather let it afflict me here, the slave Your friend did send will sadly bear your yoak, Though I dare say he may deserve your favour. Elisa. Pray Sir let's hear his worthy properties, Dances he on the rope, or tumbles, weares He a fool's coat to make his mistress merrie? Shift. All these, 'tis his desire to be a fool; That's to be fortunate: and now he's like One dancing on the ropes, ready to fall; And onely ballast with the pole of Hope; But if you'le see him tumble, you shall finde Him active in his vaulting, and he'le runne Through a small hoop with great agility. Elis. I may take money to shew him Sir, Will pay his hire, and keep his Mistress too. Shift. He'l keep her like a Queen; the envious Sun Shall not with Rayes (which yeild to her's) impair Her guarded beauties; the earth, air and sea Shall pay their tribute to her taste, her bed Shall be as soft, as air, as PhÅnix nest Perfum'd; and as the sun breaks from the East, So shall she rise, and where she shines, the day Shall be more bright by her peculiar ray. Elis. He must have richer qualities can do These feats, can he not sing and fiddle too? Shift. He'le sing his Mistress worth, and he will play Such musick, she will laugh incontinent, If she'le vouchsafe to be his instrument: But the best quality my truth can boast, Is my service, love, and loyalty. Elis. Why do you name you self? are you that servant? Pray speak the name of my good friend that sent you. Shift. I am that he, that sent and brought my self. Know dearest Lady, 'tis the property, And the reward of worth, that 'twill not be Conceal'd, your fame invited me to see, To love and honour you, and to present My person and my fortunes for a gift. Elis. They need no fortunes who are so indow'd: Nature and art have so enriched you, That you should injure them, to throw you merits On any that's unable to deserve, Or to requite them; and let me beg of you To adde this more unto your rich deserts, My pardon of their too unequal welcome. Shift. She's taken, taken by the art of man; My pretty sweetnesse, tast my clemency In this absolving kiss; this seals thy pardon; Musk, civet, nectar, marrow of them all, And all that's sweet do in her kisses meet, These kisses are dry sweet-meats, pretty mouse, They'l not extinguish thirst, nor cool the heat Of panting love, let us in private feast Our mutual desires with liquid cates. And juicy gawdies of unvalued rates. Elis. This fellow sure is travall'd from himself; Friend if you are at home, I'de speak with you. Think not a ravisht kisse a pattern of love; It is a favour which I'le not deny To the bare outside of a Gentleman, Which you do seem to wear; but know, rude sit, That your ungentleness denies your self That curtesie is owing to your shape. For my sake practice manners, or else chuse A Mistress who will suffer your abuse. Enter Dove. Dove. Did you call? Eli. I meant so; wait me in. Exeunt; manet Shift. Shift. She's gon, fled, vanisht, so are all my hopes; Shame ghost the counsel of this broaking fool; Whose sober thoughts were so precisely nice, They conceal'd where this wealthy beauty shin'd; But when the spirit of the Sack had thaw'd His frozen tongue in hope to share the pray, He speedily unfolds her whole condition, And counsels me to look; my son, sayes he, This is a nme of prosperous presage With me, which I vouchsafe to give to those Are by my care promoted to a Bride. My Son, first know that Love a warfare is, Where the Commande: sights with stratagems And courage, he doth bribe the Officers For to betray their charge; if this not take, He springs the wall, that valour may prevail In those designs, where subtilty did fail: So when thou woo'st, see those are near thy Mistress; The Chamber Secretary, or the man Carries her private errands, (then he sent For th'yeoman of the dogs to practise on) But if this fail, assay to make a breach, Women are brittle Clay, and made to yeild, Where manhood shews his standard in the field. This he call'd counsel of War. May he thrive, Like to the sage advice he did contrive. Enter Dove. Dove. What, at your afternoon's devotion sir? Shift. Yes, I was praying, Sir, for the adversity Of the old knave that made us two acquainted. Dove. Believe me, prayer is now out of fashion; But let not that poor fool afflict your brain; Shift. But I may send my wishes after him; Cassandra's miserie still wait on him; May truth he speaks, wander, and never finde Any believing ear to entertain it, That when he preaches youth with vowes And sinowy succulent to wealthie widows, They may be infidels to all his doctrines; Be he the mark't Owle, hooted and cry'd Into contempt by all the countrey youth That is unwiv'de, and may all maids that see This cheating vizor vow virginitie. Dove. Suffer this shadow vanish from your thoughts. And be advis'd by me; let not your hopes Cool in a faint discouragement, because Your Mistresse gave no adieu at parting; 'Twas onely a maid's niceness, not to seem Too soon o'recome; invade her with some gift May speak your love to him, win her's to you. Shift. I did invade her, and that fiercely too; But that's the miserie, she doth not love Invading; and if gifts could take her, freely I made a tender of my self and fortunes. Dove. Courtship exactly needy, let her know The richnesse of your love; dear Sir your bounty To me makes me your friend and servitour; I know a Blackamoor whose properties Your knowledge will confesse, deserve promotion, He sings well, dances, fences, and to grace These qualities, he can varicinate Your Fortunes, and the dark events of Fate, Unhappily. Shift. Yet happily his skill May fail; but why such pains to paint This smootie piece, with beauteous praise? if you Can paint the Devil white, what's that to me? Dove. I'le tell you what, he now doth mourn his want Of service, in the loss of an old Master. Shift. He's of the mourning colour, right indeed, And di'de in grain; but truly I need none, That tells strange fortunes, or laments his own. Dove. Nay if you are so wise, at once to spell And scoffe my purpose, good Sir farewell. Shift. Be not offended friend, If my despair Make me inquisitively suspitious Of any powerfull means, for to advance me In the high favour of the blest Elisa. But what for Loves sake of this Blackamoor? Dove. Advance him in the service of your Mistress, His honest thanks will twenty ways requite you; He will bely your Fortunes, swear what lordships Do call you Master, and what goodly houses Do mourn your absence, what delightfull gardens Will freshly spring upon your wedding day, Being quickned with your Bride's desired ray; Then he will shew how you bestow your time; How you do number minutes by your sighes, And that your tongue each quarter strikes Elisa. Shift. Thanks honest friend; but dost thou think she will Accept him from me? Dov. If his proper worth Did not commend him, yet her manners can Not well refuse what curtesie bestowes. Shift. I prethee send him to me speedille. Dove. Within this hour we'le wait you at your lodging. Shift. 'Till then adieu; this is good husbandrie, To give what's dear to keep, and cheap to buy.

Goodw. Vnder your pardon, leige Lord, you might In more decorum dub Sir Michael Hog With sword of Bacon, then with Knightly arms. Crab. Your Pardon graciously prevents your chiding. Because you beg'd it e're you did offend. You are too bold to interrupt my course, And I do make my Queen to kneel too long. Arise my Empress, for a day, My love, my dove, for ever and aye. Goodw. Now Mrs. Cunnimonger, thy dull faith may see What I oft told thee, that I was thy better Genius, to guide good fortune to thy home; Whose blindnesse else could never find the way; In gratefulnesse let thy devotion then Build Altars to my bountie, and enshrine Your great protecting power in beds of down; On which your humblenesse must sacrifice The first fruits of mature beauties, and their Sweet maiden honours to my just desires. Which merits more then naked thanks can pay. Mrs. Con. Sir I am wholly yours, what would you more? Good. What would you more? is thy cold putrid corps An equal recompence, to my rich desert? You should have wrack't your ingrate fansie, to Devise a thousand waies for my delight. You should incontinently send this meazled page To cater for my taste, untasted beauties; But now you'r wholly mine, what should I more? Mrs. Cun. My meaning was, that my endeavours sweat For your content, and all I can call mine I freely prostitute to your command. Hog. And fear not Sir, I will present you fruits In full maturitie, readie to fall; But never yet did suffer bruise by falling; Yet stirred with your gentle breath, their fall Shall (as your servant) lowly wait your call. Goodw. Then I will gild thy fangs, officious swine, And thou shalt wear my cloth of richest blue, Shall make thee known by the right famous name Of the blue Boar of the Bank-side; but while We talk away the day, our Sovereign Is still as night; awake, most mighty Sir, And blesse us with the storie of your dream. Crab. Why I was thinking how unkinde, and most Vnnatural fool, my wretched father was. And that which grieves my Highness most, they say, I am so like him. Mrs. Cun. Let not untimely grief Eclipse the birth-day of your Majestie; 'Tis in your power to be like whom you please, Now then be like your self, that is a King. Crab. I will be like to any man, before Such an old, doting, and penurious drivel. Lyd. Now by my truly it doth ill beseem Your son-ship to revile your father thus. Crab. Peace Chicken; I may call him any thing Now he's dead, and would that I had known Him such a coxcombe while he was alive, I would have better tutour'd him, yfaith la. Goodw. Though Princes need not show a reason of Their sayings, yet, dread Sir, give us to know The cause of this opinion of your father. Crab. First then you shall swear I am not like him. Hog. What e're ill manner'd tongue dares to affirm, Our royal Prince is like the Clown his father; This often well-approved steel defies him, Whose righteous point shall stop the mouth of slander. Good. Sir, by your worth and virtues I doe swear, This confirmes you most unlike your father, Who never was guiltie of worth of virtue. Mrs. Cun. Sir, I do swear you are most like to him Whom most you ever lov'd, your lovely self. Crab. Whom best I ever lov'd, is naught to thee; I'me sure 'twas not my father: but whom now I love and ever shall, is my sweet Queen, Who now must kisse the book before she swear. Lyd. Then by my maidenhead I swear, for I Have learn't to swear by nothing else, that you Are so unlike unto your worthless Sire, That loving you I hate his memorie. Crab. Then listen Knights and Ladies to my tale, My doating daddie (most unworthie he Of such a hopefull son) when he lay sick, (Most worthie he for to be ever sick, But that he was more worthie to be dead:) Fearing his death was nigh, in foolish spight. Depriv'd his heir the blessing of his life. Mrs. Cun. O cruel man, O most unnatural father! Crab. First, on that blessing which he then did fear Would be his last, he charg'd me I should ne're (Vnlesse I were perplext with suites in Law.) Behold this glorious and delightfull Citie, Which he then call'd expensive, proud, and vain Hog. O most ignoble slander! and the foule That ever stain'd the mouth of Gentleman. Crab. But that he is descended from my self, My roial self, he were no Gentleman; But that's not all; next this, my son, said he, Abstain from stranger women, that's as I Interpret it, tast not fair Lydia's sweetnesse. Good. I rather think he meant that you should feast Vpon no other dainties, she must be No stranger to you; is she not your Queen? Crab. Faith I could give thee leave to beat me Frank, If I did love it; what a dolt was I, To think my Lydia was a stranger to me? Goodw. Your royaltie has power to absolve It self, great Sir, from a far greater crime. Mrs. Cun. Well, if your father's cruelty did lay Any more such commands upon your Youth, It will become your age and noble virtue, With speed to disobey his crueltie. Crab. Thy words perswade me: if they do not come Vnder the name of counsel, I'le not be Counsell'd by any she in Christendome. Mrs Cun. The heavens bless thee from all other counsel But what thy own discretion shall suggest. Crab. Well said, this night we'le sup with thee, here's gold To buy engendring meats. I like my Father? My Lydia adieu until the evening. Lyd. May mirth still wait on you till your return. Mrs. Cun. Farewell till then, sweet man, and I'le take care That then, than thee there's none shall better fare. Exeunt Cun. &amp; Lydia. Crab. Come noble Frank, how shall we overcome, Or (as some say) beguile these tedious houres? Goodw. Nay as you please, this day your Kingdome lasts; You may command these winged posts to flie With greater speed, or slowly for to wait Your will; but if you please, we'le hear a Play. Crab. Content yfaith, they say they are brave things. Good. They are the truest Image of all Humors, Manners, Conditions; there you may behold The many winding arts of subtile slaves, Who like a Cuttle do conceal their fraud In their own Ink, while they exonerate The old suspicious Father's purse, to store The thriftlesse Sons; here may you see the vain And boasting Souldiers, talking wounds &amp; scars, To comfort his long fasting steel with Of some ensuing bloudie feast, and here Is seen presented the penurious Heir. The lively image of his Father's manners, As the ComÅdian is of his; but you Are made of purer clay, sifted and strain'd From all your Father's dregs; whose tender age Did nere own Folly for to feed the Stage. Crab. Thou know'st I am no Niggard, and my Father Was wont to say I had a Courtly humour, To which he often did professe such hate, As now, me thinks, I long to be a Courtier. Goodw. Sir, the first Element of a Courtier is To be in Debt, the Cris cross is the last. Crab. Let me alone, Il'e learn that lesson quickly If that thy care will purchase me a Book, I mean a man of legible belief. Goodw. Doubt not of store of Horn-books in the Citie; But know, that my presaging care prevents Your wishes; I appointed to observe This road and hour a Draper, whom I meant To practise Courtship on my self, and if Enter Whittington You please, he is your Book, &amp; you may read Faith in his looks; &amp; timely here he coms, Mr. Whittington, a good and happy day Shine fair successe unto your Busie thoughts. Whit. They meet with good success in meeting you, And I will that daies happiness commend, Which blesseth us with the sight of an old friend Good. I now pronounce you happy in a new, That is, I will enrich you with the knowledge Of this deserving Gentleman, whom when You have read throughly, you'l maintain, that all Are Dunces which are ignorant of him. Whit. Grant me your favour, noble Sir, to study you, That I may thrive in goodnesse by the great Example of your most amazing worth. Crab. I am no Conjuring book, to be lockt up From publick view; you have fair leave and free, Lo I unclasp my self unto your reading Good. To grace you Sir, his outward worth alone Shall fill large pages in your Common place Book; Where at your leisure, you with joy may read Your self inroll'd in number of the Faithfull. Whit. He'le highly grace me; would he try my Faith? Crab. Gramercie honestie; when I am Sheriff, I'le prove thy Faith for half a hundred Liveries. Goodw. Mean while make trial of his Faith for one, You see my upper garment's course and thin, Make me in this your servant, and by th'Faith Of Mr. Whittington I'le ever call you Master. Crab. Thou injur'st much thy self, to take upon thee This dear condition, and thy friend to boot, That dost prevent his bounty by thy suite; For that which he should pray thee to accept, Command my word, for as my word commands Good. Let it be of the finest black I pray Sir, And, for you know I am no Hypocrite, Dispose for an equality of Plush; I love to have my garments like my self, Though plain without, yet richly lin'd within. Whit. It shall be done Sir, and upon my credit, The outside shall be like your self, that is, A traveller from Spain; although I dare Say, that the nappe shall not be worn so bare. Crab. I pray you Sir acquaint me with some time Of leisure you can grace me at my lodging; Some urgent businesse now calls loudly on us, Or else this afternoon should not divorce us. Good. That was well spoken Sir &amp; gracefully. Whit. To wait on you, each minute yeilds me leisure, Who now am more your servant then the times. Good. Each morning doth confine him to his studies, You cannot miss him then within, since you Have made him now more bookish then he was. Whit. His nobleness commands my often visits; But at this time my business equals yours, Though I in all things else am most unequal: Therefore I'le beg your leave to take my leave. Crab. Farewel til next we meet, my faithfull Friend. Good. Adieu kind Sir; come Master lets away. 'Tis almost time we now were at the Play. Exeunt. Enter Dove and Elisa. Dove. Prepare your eyes and ears, the ScÃ¦ne is ready; Your servant acts the Blackamore so well, You cannot easily know him for your Friendly. Elis. Not know him? 'tis a slanderous untruth, To say a slight disguise can hide his graces: Were he involv'd within a cloudie mist By some mysterious charm, a lover's eye Can chase away those mists, and make them flie Like to a yeilding vapour 'fore the Sun. Dove. Well I am sure, if that he had not bin Of mine own making, I should nere have known him; And, but we Painters by our trade do fear No colours, sure his looks had scar'd me, So they will you, if that you not consider The inside of the Gipsie is your Friendly. Elis. 'Tis not his outside that I lov'd him for. Though he be most beyond expression lovely; For were he truly so as he is painted, Love should shake hands with Ioy for to embrace him: But truly say, how this disguise becomes him. Dove. When I had finisht half my smooty piece, I did present him with a Glass, wherein He might behold, and wonder at my skill; Me seem'd that I had learnt the art to frame In one space various shapes, for such was he; Half white and red, and half a Blackamore: But lo, in him blushing usurpt the place Of Wonder; 'twas a pleasant sight, to see On the one side a gracefull modestie Repose her self upon a bed of roses; When on the other, the pure sanguine streaming Striving to overcome the Injurie The Painter did him, made him appear to be Iust like a Negro blowing of a coal. Elis. For love's sake make no sport of our misfortunes; What is all this unto my question? Dove. I'me shewing how he becomes his vizor; When I had fully finisht all my work, He then begins to practise servile gestures, He seem'd to me to have forgot himself, It is no wonder then if you not know him. Elis. Pray strike no more on this ill sounding string; Thy self hast seen his modestie to shine Through his benighted looks, &amp; dost thou think His other graces are less eminent? Think'st thou an envious cloud can quite eclipse Or darken the bright glory of the Sun? They only yeild a shade, so does this die Of my best Friendly like a shadow, make This outward glory greater to appear. Knock within. Dove. I say no moreâthese are your servants knock. Exit Dove. El. Well, let them in; O heaven, how shall I keep My countenance, when Friendly is so chang'd; But when my Love's disguised look's unknown, Love pardon me, if I not keep my own. Enter Shift, Friendly, Dove. Shift. Lady vouchsafe a servant from me, whose desert Doth lay just claim unto so high preferment. Eli. I dare not trust your commendations Sir, You did deceive me in the last you brought me. Shift. Therefore my care hath sought out one, whose worth Will expiate my former Injurie. Elis. Where is this man of men you so extol? Shift. Lo this is he, whose waiting humbleness Doth speak both his condition and desire. Elis. What do you mock me? have you brought this Glass To shew my feature, I confess not fair; Yet not so foul as you would make my soul. Shift. Fair, do not overthrow me with your scorn, Now overthrown with sorrow, for my fault. Giving this servant for a tast to shew Your rich perfections by comparison, Though judging proof will find his service can Deserve, if nothing else, at least to serve you. Elisa. What strange device is this? or what new way, That sonnes of night should serve us in the day? Friend. Think Ladie, that with vigilant delight, My care shall act your pleasure day and night. Dove. Vouchsafe his service Mistress, let him be Your black Postillion, and a lively Embleme Of darksome night that ushers in the day. Elis. First let me know his properties kind Sir. Pray you what name doth sign your Blackamore? Shift. His name was once Thuano hence he is What your sweet goodness now shall please to call him. Elis. Thuano, canst thou cross thy armes and sigh: Or hast thou learnt to personate a sorrow, To darken more thy darkned countenance? Hast taught thy eyes to weep, as if thy tears Did strive to wash thee into red and white? Canst thou exclaim on cruel Beauty; crie Ay me! with a most sad dejected grace? Shift. What have I done? sure she would fain perswade This smooty Blackamore to be my rival. Elis. Canst change with art the tenour of thy looks? Now casting up thy wretched eyes to heaven, As if from thence thou mean'st to beg for pity; Now fixing them on earth, as if thou had'st Seen Mercie drop, but lost it in the fall; Canst thou profoundly now be perjur'd too? For know Thuano, all this thou must doe, And swear that so does he who did present thee: Yet none can personate these graces truly, But he who feels the passion which he acts. Shift. She doth abuse me, evidently mock me; Ladie, the Page I praise hath worthier gifts Then those you name, his skil holds in his hand The little Statute-book of heaven can read The Starres decrees, and shew what they intend Of weal or woe. Friend. Pardon me, noble goodnesse, That I am dumb so long unto your quÃ¦ries, Which do so feelingly describe my state, That in them I may read the lively picture Of the commanding passion in my breast; For know, (if you will others fortunes know Before your own) that once it was my lot For to be lov'd; O most unworthy I, For to be lov'd by one so good, so fair! Whom yet my youthfull carelesnesse or pride Did so neglect, that love did in revenge Blast me with this deserv'd deformitie. But seeing in my punishment, my fault, And looking back upon the happinesse I had so wretchedly forsook, I then Too late began to love, though yet (they say) Her love continues still; but sooner shall The night and day be one, e're I'le bestow This foul Thuano on so sweet so fair, Elis. Loves penance is but short, if you repent; Sir I accept your gift, whose worth doth lesse Measure my thanks then your more worthy love, I now will take my leave, to study how I may requiteâ Exit. Shift. The thanks you leave behind, Are far above the gift you carrie hence. Courage, my heart; she cannot be unkind, If that her words be image of her mind. Exeunt Enter Crab, Goodwit, Cunnimonger, Lydia. Crab. My prettie Lydia, I have seen to day The cruel'st sight, it grieves my heart to speak't. Lyd. And I to hear't; I pray you talk of mirth, I can't endure these tales of crueltie. Crab. But I must tell it too; a handsom woman, 'Cause the King's son in love would ly with her Against her will, would needs go kill her self. Lyd. What did she kill her self against her will? Crab. I say against her will he lay with her: I have forgot the foolish woman's name. Goodw. It was Lucrece the chast, a primitive Roman, who in the humor of the time, Did in vain-glory kill her self for Fame; But know, our soil breeds none so desperate. Cun. 'Faith and the Romans too are now more wise. Good. And thou saist true, for they who read her storie, And in their antick Arras see her bleed, Pitie her Folly, and not praise her deed. Crab. Well I am sure she was a handsom wench, And but for shame, I could have found my heartâ Good. A wench Sir, 'twas a boy did personate Unto those times, a well becoming fate. But then was then, and women now are women. Cun. And you say true; for is it not think you A most unnatural thing, for any woman To stab herself: well, had my Lydia bin That Lucrece, you sweet sir, that sweet King's sonâ Ent. Falconer. I'le say no more, but truly you shall finde Her neither to her self, nor you unkinde. Crab. I hope so, else I must with sorrow sing, Why should passion lead the blinde? 'Cause my Lydia proves unkind. Falc. This is vile musick, not to be compar'd With the melodious bleating of my sheep. Good. What means the man? I hear no sheep but one. Falc. 'Tis true, while you now spoke, but one did bleat; But if you heard a hundred chime together, You'd swear it were most admirably sweet. How like you this my hearts? dost not exceed The Quire of pauls, or all the holy bells Shakes his bag, Which most devoutly sing the time o'th'day? Crab. 'Faith Dick this sheepish harmonie is sweetest, When they are pen'd up in these narrow folds; But where's my Ring, the token that I sent? Falc. The stubborn Bailie swears that he will keep it To shew your uncle for his own discharge; But who regards the bait, that has the fish? Cun. 'Tis a wise sentence Richard, and a true; But this is now no time for sentences, 'Tis eight a clock, and supper stayes for you. Falc. And let it stay; I know you long to sup Upon my mutton: but where's all my thanks For my good speed? does it deserve no more, That by a trick I chang'd my tired Iade, To hasten my return, that by my wits I took the prey out of the Harpies foot, Who strongly gript it, 'till I boldly swore, You would undoe him and his Family; And shew'd his bag and wallet in the starres; Does not all this deserve a welcom home? Cun. Sir you are welcome home most heartily. Falc. That's not enough: you now ought all do penance For your neglect; you Mrs. Cunnimonger, And Mr. Goodwit too, shall wait on me This night at Supper; Lydia I pardon For my good Masters sake, him for his own: So Lydia, seal this pardon with a kiss. Crab. O traitor, villain, sacrilegious villain! Falc. Nay 'tis decreed, and she must offer't too, Or else farewell, this purchase is my own. Cun. Alas sir, what's a kiss? what would you do If his desert should ask a greater thing? Crab. If it must needs be so, I prethee sweet Lydia, dispatch me quickly from my pain. Lyd Sir I obey your praiers, not his commands. Falc. Here, take the price of my felicitie. Crab. And be thou honour'd with our order more, Thy carefull speed dubs thee a knight o'th'post: Thy office be, for to begin the way, While I behind do wipe thy kiss away. Exeunt. Enter old Goodwit (vvith a letter and the ring,) Dove. Old Good. Cheated by fools and villains? this is fine; And my wise Baily thinks he has done well, Because he kept this token, when he should Arrest the slave which brought it, and now bere He writes the threats which overcame him: well, I will go down to prevent further ills, Be it your care for to retrive the stray. Dove. I warrant you, if sense and skill can do't. This afternoon a little businesse called me Into a Draper's shop, whom I did find, Booking a debt, to which was superscrib'd My stragling master's name, though he indeed Was but a surety (as the Draper told me) For the poor sneak which did intice him hither, Who now it seems is casting of his skin, O. Good. Imploy your time and study to rewinde This snake from his Caduceus, the main staff, Which doth support him, and unsinuate Him from that breast that gives him lively heat. Dove. Sir, I have won upon this Citizen To know their lodging and their daily haunt, And for some future curtesies of hope, He will arrest this Snake, in's cloak of credit As soon as it can warm him, and will free My Master, whom I mean for to secure From the enquirie of this noisome viper. O. Good. Be speedie in your course; I hope you see Your charge alreadie, to insafe my neece And daughter in my absence, from the busie Courtship of idle suits, and to finde My nephew In this peopled wildernesse. Dove. This is my task alone, your Neece and Daughter Will finde sufficient guard in their own virtues. O. Goodw. Well, now the night invites to bed, betimes I'th'morn, my jorney, and your charge begins. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. IV. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Dove &amp; Falconer. Dove. Fortune and Love befriend me; my old Master By this hath left half of his way behind him; And though I am stil doing, my successe Doth call me idle, my young wandring Squire Lay not at home to night, and hereabouts Should be the place they supt at, if my draper Be not deceiv'd in his intelligence; Ent. Falc. But soft? who have we here? the Falcner, nay Slink not away good Richard, here are none But friends and fellow servants; why dost look About thee so, doth any man pursue thee? Falc. No, no, but who had thought to meet thee here? Dove: Not thee I dare to swear, but tell me how Our Master does, and his refinde seducer; Does his new upper weed become him trimly? Falc. Does he speak out of knowledge, or by chance? 'Faith Tom my Master's well, exceeding well, Looks and lives like himself, that's like an heir Deliver'd from tuition; but what means Your riddle of new weeds, and trim seducers? Dove. Would neither thou nor I knew what it meant. But I will pose you with more riddles yet; Are there not certain femal ghosts do walk This quarter, silken some, and some of stuffe; Some single, some in couples, and some squir'd, But above all, is not the house you supt at Fearfully haunted? are these riddles too? Falc. 'Tis well we left the Countrey; sure they do Begin to studie witchcraft here of late: Art thou awake? or dost thou dream of ghosts? I dare to swear here's greater store of flesh Then spirit, but if any such there be; Thou art a huntsman, take but a little pains If that they crosse this quarter, thou maist prick um. Dove. I do not mean to hunt them to the buttock; But tell me truly, what severe occasions Calls thee abroad out of thy nest so early? Falc. I had as good confesse, he knows already: The truth is, Tom, my Master's to be married, I now go for a Priest to do the feat. Dove. How? married? and you go for the Vicar Of hel to join em for there the match was made: If thou wast one bore witnesse to the contract, Now in the name of all the Furies, tell me What's she must be my Masters Succuba. Falc. I was not much mistaken, I did think He was a Witch, he proves a Coniurer. I'le shew thee what she is, by shewing what We are, that is to say, her servant's servants; There's a Court riddle Sir for you to pick; She's one that's taken with my Master's wit, As he is taken with her chastitie: A fine young thing, that newly puts out rewen, Such excellent game, that mighty love would change Himself into Merlin to enjoy her. Dove. Do not thou talk of game, when I'me in earnest, And be thou honest, else the gallows shall Make a short end of all thy knaverie, For stealing of the Farmer's nag: by whom (Speak truth upon thy peril) was my Master So suddenly inveigled to his ruine. Falc. Fear prompts me to speak truth against my nature: Now as I live Tom, l'le not lye; there dwells Within that house, a prettie handsome Tit, Whom our wise Master fain would he withall; He's very hot upon the spur, but she Being instructed by her cunning Aunt. Thanks him, and takes him up again at pleasure. Somthing she gives him leave to do, but not What most he would; and so at once she does Inflame his sharp desires and tame them, briefly, She vows he nere shall ly with her, before He marries her, which he resolves to do. Dove. But I do mean to crosse his resolution; Your task must be for to forget your errand, See him no more till noon, at your return Any excuse will serve, and so farewell Exit Falc. I shall not need your aid to my designs, I never shall be able to redeem him By my own power, I must require my master And fellow servant Friendly to assist me. Nor dare I trust this villain, here's a toy In town to seek him, with a barn to boot; I will direct her to him, she shall call His arrant rogueship 'fore a man of worship, And there with open mouth cry out for marriage; Where he shalt take his choice, whether he'le go To Church or Prison, for he'le nere be able To purchase bayle for keeping of the child, So there is one impediment dispatcht; Yet I forget the aid I promis'd to The Draper in his suit unto Elisa, Who with his painted mole by this is acting Her servant Friendly, whom I said was travail'd. In which disguise he thinks to win her too; But I must now deprive the Blackamore Of all this mirth, in seeing of his shape Usurp't; while he stands mute to hear another Courting his dearest Mistress in his name. But why do I thus talk away the day, When I should do? lest time be vainly spent, To redresse ills which care might once prevent. Exit. Enter Crab, Lydia, Cunningmonger, Goodwit, and Hog. Crab. Come Lydia, now the time draws nigh, when we With worthies male and female shall enrich The needy world; this morn I sent unto A cunning man to learn the fittest time For to engender Wits in, he replyes, This night 'twixt twelve and one, do not omit Thy nuptial duties, the starres counsel it; If that thou wilt beget a wit transcendent, This night is Hermes lord of the Ascendent; Well soon I mean for to invite the wits, Or as thou call'st them Frank, Deipnosophists, Unto my bridal supper; where I will Have nothing but braines diversly cook't Of birds, beasts, fishes, tith-pigs, and woodcocks; Our drink shall be brisk claret, for to refine The Infant's sparkling Ingenie! but now Where shall we finde a cook of wit? that has Not had his education in the kitchin, Whose brain's not overcast, with mistie clouds Arising from the stream of grosser meats. Cun. I'le be your cook Sir, and though I do say't, I have as good a wit of a grosse body, As any woman ever need to boast of. Good. Never take care for choosing of your cook, The very dressing of the braines will make him wittie. Hog. Take you no thought for cook, or cheer, leave these To mine and my old Master's care; you now Must feast upon your sweet delicious wife, She will be meat and med'cine to you, for her sight Alone, the shaking ague will affright; And soon at night, if you do not awry go, She'le ease you suddenly of the Tentigo, Yea before Galen, she will cure the feaver With her down belly, and her thighes of bever. Crab. How? bever dost thou call them: I am sure That they were Felt last night; but do you hear? Do not you call my Lydia my wife, It is a name, the countrey people use. Nor shall she call me husband, therefore Frank, Prethee devise some fine Poetick names, To dart at one another before strangers. Good. What do you think, if you were call'd the Seal, And she your wax? on whom in every kisse You thus may seal the image of your love. kis. her Lyd. Pray heaven I may wax worthy of his love But trust me Sir, you do me injurie, To think his love hath made so slight impression Within my breast, that it may be defac't, Like to a fading image made in wax. Goodw. How think you Ladie then, if you were called His Cynosure, the saylers starres by which They finde their way thorough the pathless seas; By this they frame their course, you Sir must be The Pilot, which does steer by her blest light Alone, unto the haven of your blisse: Or if you will be an Astronomer, In every kiss thus you may take her height. Kisses her. Crab. Me thinks this Cynosure's a pretty name, I prethee tell me what it signifies. Goodw. It signifies properly the dogs taile. Crab. Ha, ha, ha; 'tis the best jest was ever heard or read of. Good. 'Tis a good jest indeed can raise such mirth; But my wit's hood winkt, for I cannot finde it: I pray Sir tell us where the jest does lye. Crab. Where it does ly? is it not evident, That thou didst kiss the dog's tail, I shall nere Love her again 'till thou hast chang'd her name. Good. You lik't this well untill you understood it; That you may learn from hence how happy 'tis Sometimes for to be ignorant; what then If she were call'd your Touchstone you her straw, For as the Touchstone doth examine metals, So will she prove what metal you are made of; And as the straw doth to the Touchstone skip, So thus must you skip nimbly to her lip; Kisses her Thus must you cling in every kisse you give her: But above all the name of Lydia move me, 'Cause Lapis Lydius signifies a Touchstone. Crab. I like your reasons well, but not so well Your often kissing, therefore hence, forbear. Good. Touchstones the oftner rub'd, do draw the better. Crab. Fairly put off, well, so it is decreed; A Parliament of wits could not devise More fitting names confirm'd with greater reasons. Sings. To day the Priest shall make't a law, That I shall be thy onely straw, The virtue of whose Kiss shall draw, Besides my self no other straw. Lyd. Sings The Touchstone's black and so am I; The Touchstone's hard, and so not I; The Touchstone doth the metal try, And as the Touchstone so will I. Hog Sings. As soon in straw is kindled fire, So you inflamed with desire; Yellow's the straw, yet I suppose, That you will ne're wear yellow hose. Cun. I have no voice to sing, yet I will say That this is Straw's and Touchstone's bridal day. Goodw. Sure Hermes now is climbing to his height, Who doth inspire your wits to versifie; I would the Priest were come, for any time This day will serve to do the trick you talk't on? Crab. I, to get Wits, and I do mean to call All my boyes Strawes, and all my wenches Touchstones. Enter Dove and Friendly. Dove. Master, heaven give you joy, fame sings that you Are towards a wife, and I have brought a Priestâ Good. Your office bids you welcome, so are you. Fr. I thank my office then, let him thank you. But know Sir, that I am no Priest, but servant Vnto a sister of this Gentleman's; She's now in town, and doth by me invite him This day to dine with her at her own lodging. Crab. I prethee tell her she shall dine with me; She shall have gloves to boot, and you, and you: And now I think on't, she and my cousin Win Shall be my bride-maids, prethee tell um so. Fr. First I must tell you, that I do not mean To make a fruitlesse errand; my adventure Is to redeem you from these Harpies clawes. Good. Prethee how many Harpies are there here? Friend. E'ne a full mess, of every sex a pair. Good. Peace, or I'le teach your Gipsie-ship some manners. Dove. Would you would teach your self some honesty; Vncloud your brow Sir, for 'tis not a frown Can fright us from our purpose; therefore Sir, Resolve to leave this shop of sin and shame, This furnisht ware house of Iniquity. Crab. Honest Tom Huntsman, have but patience. Lyd. Is this a Huntsman Sir? now out upon him. He smells most vilely of the kennel; such a one As this same fellow is, and sixteen couple, Did eat my father quite out of the countrey. Dov. 'Tis cheaper keeping a whole hoast of dogs, Then one such costly fizling hound as you. Cun. Now out upon thee naughty man, prophane Dog-driver, call heaven's creatures fizling hounds? Dov. And salt Bitch too, for such are she &amp; thou. Good. This idle rogue would fain be beaten sure. Enter two Serjeants. Dov. I would indeed, 'tis one part of my business. Hog. You shall not go without your errand then. 1. Serj. Hold friends, as you are men, this open house Promist the ending of some feast, but wee Are come to the beginning of a fray. Dov. About your business friend, that is the man. 2. Serj. Sir, the King greets you well. Good. I'me glad he's well. Cun. Ye are two paltry knaves, thus to intrude Into a private house; good Gentlemen, Free a poor widows house from these vile catch-poles. Dove. Away Sir, we will free't from honest men. Exeunt Dove, Friendly, Crab. Good. Vnhand me Sirs, I mean to put in bail. 1. Serj. Discharge the debt Sir, that's your only bail. Cun. Why what's the debt? here's one will see you paid; Oh me! he's gon, but I will follow him. Exit. Good. I prethee Hog assist me 'gainst these villains. Hog. Loose him, or else by Termagaunt I will. 2. Serj. Will ye be pork or bacon, I'le provide A feast for Pluto; hence, unlesse you mean The Furies shall make Puddings of your guts. Lyd. Good friends do not abuse the Gentleman. 1. Serg. We'le not abuse him chicken, for thy sake We'le see him where he shall be safe enough. Hog. Come Mrs. Lyddi, let us in, you see It is not in our power for to help him. Good. Let your unmanner'd gripe unseize my shoulder, Or I will rime your heads into a nooze, As Hipponax did Bupalus, or buskin'd Archilocus Lycambe, I will rogues. 2. Serj. That's a good jest I swear, I'de fain see that; This fellow's sure in a Poetick rage. Good. Or if your fears make you decline the rope, I'le brand your name with profound infamie. 1. Serj. Profound infamie? what a fine word's that; Go. D'ye grin ye dog? would I were loose again. 2. Serj. No sir, the dog's name's holdfast, that you'le finde. Ent. Cunnimonger. Cun. Kickt, beaten, cheated of my guest? was ere Poor woman thus abus'd; but which is worse, My silly Neece fondly restor'd the bag Of which she once was Lady Treasurer. Good. This is ill newes, my hopes lay in that bag; Sweet Mistress lend me for an hour or two The seasonable price of my releasement, You know my friend will faithfully repay't. Cun. Alas good Sir, what would you have me do? You know how poor and nakedly we live, All I can lend's my pity and my prayers. Good. Thy pity proves me wretched, and thy prayers Do make me hopeless, for they'l nere be heard. Keep your devotion till your Carting, Madam, And leave me to the mercy of these fiends. Cun. Sweet man, I have no power to part from him. Goo. Then stay there still, my kind affliction. 1. Serj. Come Sir, you see your hopes, please you walk? Good. Yes, lead me on unto my Purgatory; Yet stay a while and hear a word of reason. 2. Serj. Let it be brief reason then, very brief. Good. 'Tis only this, I know by circumstance, You are employ'd by draper Whittington. 1. Serj. 'Tis very true, if this be all, let's walk. Good. The debt which you arrest me for is owing For this same cloak I wear, the debt is young, This the first day of wearing; give you him His cloak again, and me my liberty. 2. Serj. He did give us no such commission sir, Yet what lyes in our power we will befriend you, We'le place you where he shall be sure to finde you; That if his pleasure be to visit you, You may your self deliver the condition. Good. If this be all your kindness, march away; Farewell old noble true-penny, farewell. Cun. Farewell sweet man, I cannot chuse but weep. Good. Now I am yours, yet still my mind is free, To triumph over Fortunes injury. Exeunt. Enter Friendly, Elisa, Dove. Friend. Believ't, 'twas no small task to get him off. Elis. Where have you dispos'd of him in love's name? Friend. Where he must learn loves lesson, with my sister. Elis. I hope that he will learn by her example: But what's the reason Dove, you did warn me Of my new suiter, whom you sent, who does With confidence usurp my Friendly's name; And why did you direct him to a Painter, Who trimly made his mole on the wrong side? Dov. Only sweet Mistress, for to make you merry. Elis. Thou didst not miss thy ayme, for I did laugh To see my fruitlesse labours. When I could By no means make him think he was not Friendly, But when I call'd for water, for to prove Whether he would endure the test; Lord how The Gallant chaf't. But yet my Cousin Win Thought all this while I did but counterfeit, Untill she saw a just disdain possesse My brow. Then she indeed began to blame My unkind entertainment of a stranger. To her I left him then to make amends, For that wherein my rudenesse did offend; And if I am not in loves art mistaken. (As sure I am not) my sweet Coze is taken. Dove. May heaven say amen unto your guess, Then am I master of my ends: for he Is rich and thrifty, and I yet may live To see my Mrs. Win my Lady Mayoresse. Friend. Faith I do long to see how much he's like me. Elis. Indeed 'tis pity forto interrupt em. Did you not say you knew my other suter? Friend. Hang him a slave, which rents his hackney chin To city falling-stars, and toothlesse madams. But I will sowce him for his sawcinesse. Elis. He is more sawcy yet then you doe think; Now I receiv'd this Letter, pray you read it. Friend. reads it. Fr. I am not ignorant how well you love me; And Lovers know what Lovers most desire. I hear your Vncle's not in town. I leav't Vnto your wit for to beguile your Cousin, And meet me soon at Mrs. Cunnimongers. Il'e read no more! monster of goatish boldness; May he first twine with Scorpions. For love's sake Tell me of what complexion are my hose? Elis. I'me jealous of my self, although not guilty Of word or look, which carried lesse then scorn. Dove. Il'e solve this riddle. But this very morning I met him here, enquir'd how well you liked His Blackamore. I did reply the truth, And added this which I did think was true, (And which no doubt's the cause of his presumption) That you did love him better for his gift. Elis. You should have said that I did hate him lesse. But now I hate him most, who thinks me false. Dove. The carriage of this businesse leave to me, Il'e fit him with another bed fellow, Onely lend me your name to bring him on. Elis. Be sure my honour do not suffer in't. Dove. 'Tis in your power to secure your honour. What fitter time then this to tie that knot, Which onely fate is able to untie? Your Vncle's absent, and your Neece employ'd; Let this hour execute the heavens decree, And the Priest joyn their hands whose hearts agree. Friend. I dare not to dissent from his advice, Seeing time it self doth seem to counsell us. Elis. Thy goodnesse (Friendly) won me, let thy virtues Guide me, for them I ever will obey. Dove. be speedy then, for time makes no delay. Exeunt. Enter Phillis and Crab. Crab. Hard hearted Tigre, unkind Adamant. Phil. You are mistaken sir, my name is Phillis. Crab. O thou hast kill'd me with thy cruelty. Phil. Have dead men learn't to walk and talk again? Trust me, I nere saw ghost yet better fed. Crab. 'Tis true, I live, but yet a dying life. Phil. Leave your book wooing sir, you doe not doe It handsomly. If you will love by art, Your careless habit must proclaim your passion; Your hat without a band, Garters unti'd, Your trayling Cloke, dejected look, cross armes, Should be dumb arguments of your affection. Crab. If this be all, I'le quickly prove I love. Hat be no more acquainted with a band, Garters be never ti'd again, and thou My carelesse Cloke be witnesse of my woe, While thus I look, and thus I crosse my armes. Phil. Next you should sing loves power, and your misfortune, Which lord it o're you in a dismal ditty. Crab. I'le sing no song but this. Phillida flouts me: Yet now I think on't, summer last, when first I saw you. I compil'd this sugred sonnet He Sings. Phillida was a fair maid, As fresh as any flower; Whom Harpatus the Heardsman pray'd Might be his Paramour. Phil sings Phil. But Philliday was all to coy For Harpatus to win, For Corin was her onely joy. Crab. Prethe sweet heart, let me be Corin then. Phil. Sir, I will not requite your love with scorn. Your love hath purchas'd mine, on this condition, I must command your house. Welcome my friends, Keep shocks, and monkeys, parats, parakitoes. And all things else I like for my delight. Wear clothes befitting your estate, my birth, You shall keep what retinue I think fit, What horses, coaches, litters; and what not? And when I please you must be lorded too. Crab. I will be any thing which thou wilt have me. Phil. You shall be nothing then, which not becomes you; I know lords not so rich, nor half so wise. Crab. Touchstone farewel, thy Straw bids thee adieu. Ent. Dove singing. Dove sings. Come, come away, to the Temple I say, And celebrate this Wedding day. Your sister, master, and your brother, mistress This day are to be married, and expect Your company to grate the Nuptials. Crab. To morrow I do mean they shall grace ours. Tom, she's mine own, my Wit at last hath won her. Dov. Make it one business then, let's hast &amp; get A Licence, though 'tis late i'th'afternoon; I have procur'd a Priest apochryphal, Who not regards the houres Canonical. Crab. A men say I. Phil. In troth so do not I. Did you not say that you were dead? I will Not dance the shaking of the winding-sheet. Crab. I am reviv'd again, my pretty duck; But I do wonder where my Falcner is. Dov. I met him and his doxy marching now With Mr. Constable, before a Justice; When he's at leisure, doubtless he'l find you out. Mean while your own occasions beg your hast. Crab. Come then away, god Cupid be our speed. Exeunt Enter Iustice Budge, Falconer, Grace, Constable. Budg. Sirra, how durst you get this maid with child? Falc. May't please you sir, it is a native valour. Deriv'd upon me from my ancestors. Budge. Well sirra, well, I'le teach you not to have The fear of grace before your eyes, I will. Falc. That lesson I have learnt already sir; And practis'd too, and to say truth, with us We use to fall to without saying grace. Budge. The truth is, thou art an ungracious varlet; 'Tis well for thee my wife is not at home, She'd ring thee a peal should make thy eares to tingle; Mr. Constable knowes she can speak well. Const. For wit she is the glorie of her sex, And fame doth sing her worthy to be wed To one alone, who sits in justice seat; Her tongue is tipt with Eloquence, for this And for her other gifts, the city rings on her. Bud. And well it may, you know she is a Bell, That is, you know her name is Isabell. Const. Now by my loan, a witty Apophthegm. Bud. And fellow what saist thou? this 'tis to shed My wit amongst unletter'd Animals. Falc. Blame rather sir the height of your conceits, Which are exalted far 'bove humane sense. Const. What dost thou call his worship non-sense? Budg. Let that alone, and go we to the purpose; Fellow, wilt have this woman to thy wife? Falc. My name is Richard sir, &amp; I will have her, With the same will I did appear before you. Budg. Well, if thou wilt not have her to thy bride, I mean to have thee married to Bridewell. Const. 'Tis good again, incomparably good! Fal. Good do you call't? I'me sure tis bad for me. Budg. Woman, how dost thou use to call thy name? Grac. My name is Grace, an it shall like your Worship. Budg. It likes my worship well, but this vile fellow Wants grace, and yet rejects it when tis offer'd. Const. This is still good, better and better still; Sirra, how dost thou like his Worship's wit? Falc. I think his brain is like a lottery, Where blanks and prizes most unequally Are mixt; his common talk I call the blanks, His jests the prizes, of which also are Twenty of little worth, for one of value; Of which first sort when now there were drawn three, Your tongue was trumpet to the lottery. Const. Sir, this is open Scandalum magnatum. Budg. See where my Clark and's Mistris are come home, That he may quickly write his Mittimus. Falc. Pray stay your Iourney friend, rather then so, I'le marry this same small impediment. Budg. That might have serv'd your turn, but now you are To be committed for a pettie Treason. Falc. Will you your self be judge in your own cause? Budg. And who so fit as I? for who will do Sir Roger Budge more right then Iustice Budge? Falc. Then here upon my knee I humbly beg, That you'l be mercifull as you are wise. Grace. And I, that you'l be lust as mercifull; That is, that you will make him marry me. Budg. He has his pardon upon this condition. Come rise my friend, I'me pleas'd with thy submission: And Grace I thus will grace in greeting her. kisses This night you all shal sup with me, where we'l Confirm the match, and I believe 'tis time, For now me thinks my stomach 'gins to chime.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. ScÃ¦n. 1. Ent. Shift &amp; Hog. Shift. Shame and perdition fall upon this gipsie. His false predictions are like oracles, Deceiving with their Ambiguity. Hog. What ailes the man? sir, have unquiet dreams Troubled your rest to night, that you thus talk Wildly of gypsies, and predictions; Of oracles and ambiguities. Shift. I'le tell thee Hog, I had a fortune lately Told me, which did imply I should Injoy Her, unto whom I oft had su'd in vain, Hog. Your Fortunes true: for you have often su'd Unto my Mistris Lydia in vain. Because her nights were at too dear a rate, Yet you have found her thrown into your arm's. Shift. I do confes't, and therefore I complain Upon my Fortunes ambiguity, Which I applyed unto a wealthy heir, Whose maiden zone I hop't for to untie. Hog. I hope that Lydia made you sport enough. Shift. I'le not deny's, yet she mistake doth vex me, Though 'tis my Ioy I am not gull'd alone Hog. If to Injoy fair Lydia alone, You call a gull, then you are gull'd alone, Shift. I mean this gipsie hath deceived others, (If it be lawfull to believe a Huntsman) For telling this sweet Ladies fortune, whom But now I nam'd, before a Cityzen Who did usurp the name of her olde servant, He said within three nights she should Embrace The man whom she would honour with the stile Of Husband, whom she present did behold Though his disguise did then conceal his person, Which the vain gull apply'd unto himself, When I more justly may the Fortune claim, Because I am not what my outside speaks me. Hog. How can that be, seeing you were not present? Shift. She might behold me present to her fancy. This meaning only my thoughts look't upon. Hog. For shame leave talking of these gulleties, The truth is this, the Huntsman whom you nam'd Did purchase you the pleasure of this night, Remember now you told me in the Evening When you were drunk with wine and Ioy, you meant To Wed this beauty, which you came to meet, But found contriv'd in bed before you came, Say then sir, will you marry Lydia? Shift. Thou know'st she has a foolish property Might make me pardon my self this mistake, Yet I regard not that which nicer men Do blame; the thing I might dislike in her Is, that she's poor, but yet to shew, that I Am a Philosopher, I'le marry her. Hog. Nobly and wisely spoke, and chear your heart Though she be poor, she cannot make you poorer Shift. This consolation my Philosophie Doth likewise teach me, but I'le tell thee news, I have a husband in the pickle too For thy old Mistris, one of her own trade, For both of them do live by coupling sexes, He in olde Saxon's call'd a match-maker. Hog. Good sir for once do you usurp his office To make this decent match, and I'le assist you. Shift. I do arrest thy promise, yesterday I hear his worship sought me at my lodging, But first I'le give him a preparative. Hog. I'le give him that shall work I warrant you; First I'le advance my Mrs. wealth and vertues, Then swear the greatness of my own revenew's, Which I gain only by the Fees of suiters. Shift. I do not doubt thy art, go and prepare Thy Mrs too, within this hour or two I'le send him, untill then adieu. Hog. Farewell. Exeunt Enter Falconer and Grace. Falc. And why wilt thou needs have me marry thee? Grace. 'Cause I would have you make me an honest woman. Falc. Why dost thou think all married women honest? Grace. I cannot tell, but surely I am one If I am brought a-bed in matrimony. Falc. Is that the point? but tell me when y'are married, How think you to maintain your honesty? Gra. You know the Iustice promis'd us last night His worships licence to sell ale i'th city. Falc. Now you have hit it; was't ere heard that women Maintain'd her honesty by selling ale? Gra. Surely I hear it is a thriving trade. Falc. Surely but not to thrive in honesty; For if she be not open as her tub, My Hostess takings will be very small, Although her lanted ale be nere so strong. Gra. I will do any thing which you will have me. Falc. Then first I'le have you to release our contract, Then I will have thee travel into Ireland, There thou mai'st make a nurse 'tis better far Then live by'th muddy trade of selling ale, And thank my bounty, which hath qualified Thy Inabilities for this Imployment. Gra. Did not you swear that you would marry me? Falc. I have done better chick, far better, for I've layn with thee, which I had rather do Twice twenty times, then marry the but once. Gra. Ay me, &amp; shall my love be thus requited? Yet know it is not in your power to leave me, The Iustice now is witness of the contract, Who I am sure will see it executed. Falc. Now thou hast truly said, what marriage is, That is, an execution, well, then since It will no better be, lets quickly set All things in order, and be executed. Gra. As nimbly as you can good Richard, for My time draws near, and I desire to be An honest woman e're I am deliver'd. Falc. Lets find my Mr. first, I do not mean To leave him and his service to sell ale, Where I last left him, thence, they say the devil Fetcht him away, and sure he hath been there For they look all as if they had been frighted, And still he may be there, for they do talk As if they were possest, come, let us go, And when my Master's found, appoint the day When thoul't be married and I will obey. Gra. Then this shall be the day, I'le be thy guide To find thy Mr. and more guesse beside. Exeunt Enter Shift and Derrick. Shift. The hast of your return, I fear hath made You leave more weighty business unperformed Der. Care of your good makes me forget my own, Yet in one day, (for know my clients do Observe my day) I have directed ten To their preferment, two to reputed maids Which I do rank alone in my black book, Three unto widows of the second head, And five to maids of just maturity. Shift. Pray Mr. Derrick are not you allied. unto the famous headsman of your name. Der. Somewhat I am, but whats the cause you ask? Shift. Because by you there is contriv'd the loss Of many maiden heads. Der. You'r merry sir, For know our trades do differ much, as much As the extreams of torment and delight, My office is not staind with bloud, and those Who suffer by my means do live to thank me, I beg no pardon for my fault, before The maid's depriv'd of her virginity. Shift. Yet you may ask forgiveness afterwards Of those who curse your pains, and find the hell Of marriage worse then a decollation. Der. You shall want cause I hope for to complain, When you shall see your flying love return To meet you, that you freely may enjoy her. Shift. Thanks unto both our pains, that I have done Already, our close kisses have been warm'd With the soft flame of love, and I have seal'd The match so sure, that it doth need no witness. Der. Forget not him then that procured your blisse. Shift. I am so full of joy, that you shall make Your own conditions, and besides I will (Be you not wanting to your self) in your Own way requite you with a wealthy widow. Der. I am not yet so frozen, but my blood Will heat without a fever, be then pleas'd To give me a full knowledge of my hopes. Shift. She hath a servant, who was sometimes mine, And still desires to be so, for the love I paid to his deserts, which he requires In promising his aid to win his Mistris. But you have happily prevented him, And therefore no man fitter then your self T'enjoy the benefit was meant to me. Der. I cannot but confess my self most fit, And therefore I'le assent unto your offer. Shi. You shall take letters of my commendation To my old servitour, his name is Hog, One whom his Mistris justly doth regard. Der. Let me alone for to commend my self; I'le onely take your letters for to purchase My free admittance, then condemn my cunning If my own courtship do not win the widow. Shift. Well may you speed, I'le presently go write. Der. Though 'tis no need, I'le help you to indite. Exeunt Enter Goodwit. Good. How strangely fortune guides my destinies? It is not yet five moons since I liv'd free, Yet in a forrain haven, now I breath My native aire, but want my liberty, Which method of my fate, yet lets me see Some likenesse in this contrariety. For Spain to me was but a wider prison, From whence there was no way unto my freedome, But in a hazardous capativity, Glad in a floting prison to be in immur'd, Since 'twas my safety to be so confin'd Where I did fear more dangers, then I now Do suffer, and so the bounteous heavens became My School-Masters while they my mind prepar'd For future sorrow, by foregoing its; And taught me, that my later sufferings Are little blessings by comparison: But that which lessens not my misery In this constraint, is the society Of a good old man my fellow prisoner, The Rhetorick of whose love, would needs perswade I have no cause of sadness, and I think I have the lesse, because I think he loves me, And why I know not, but lo here he comes. Enter Freeman. Free. Come I must chide you, 'cause you'l be alone. Goodw. I take this place to be a monastery, And we are all monasticks by our order. Free. This is a fain'd derision of your fortune, I see your thraldome makes you melancholy. Good. Sir, I have learn't that there is nothing free But what is infinite. Captivity Is the inheritance of all things finite; Nor can we boast our liberty, though we Are not restrained by strong holds, when as The neighbouring aire confines us, &amp; each man Is thraldom's perfect emblem, for in all The soul is captive, and the bodi's thrall. Free. Well can I see, that this Philosophy Is not the argument of true content, But constrained patience, which seeks reasons why We ought to suffer, what we cannot flye: But give me now to know my pardon first Being granted for my curiosity. Did fate or choice acquaint you with this gallant, Who now unworthily doth see you want? Good. I cannot without thanks recount the love Of that good man, with whom I travelled, he Was the sole guide and guardian of my youth, I was his onely care, his pupill, son, So he, so all call'd and accounted me, And I were most ingrate did I deny My self his son, whose love made me his heir. Free. This answer's strangely wide from what I askt. Now I am shewing how this good old man Being very sick, and ready for to pay The debt he owed to nature, call'd me to him And councell'd me for England, to receive Some moneys owing him, but above all To find a father: fate only lent him leave To name his dwelling, and that done, he dyed. Free. Still you seem forgetfull of my question. Good. I now was coming too't? when I had spent Those sums, my forward'st creditours would pay, Then I began to seek a father, where My Father did direct me, there I found You Mr. of the house, but this young gallant (As I then learned) his Fathers onely son Who late had purchast both the house and land, I thinking then my Father was the seller Meant with a sweet revenge to pray upon The buyers heir, and therefore I entice't His folly to the City, but now I Do justly suffer for my foul intents. Free. However then you mist him, you shall find A Father in that house, half uncle to This vain expensive gallant, now your cozen. Good. But how can you assure me in this truth. Free. My self is witness of the time, when you Were first committed to the carefull trust Of him who since adopted you his son, My old friend Curtise, to confirm your faith, Know I am prisoner for a debt is owing Unto your uncle this young gallants Father, Which I was surety for, his rigour made Me obstinate, but dying, he bestowed This debt upon your Father, who is willing To grant my freedome at an easier rate, And I of him to purchas't at a greater. Good. Thanks unto heaven and you, who thus have lightned My sorrows by the knowledge of a Father, I have debts owing, which would set me free, That I may now go see him, for if I Am son unto the Guardian of this heir, He's now in town with his fair neece &amp; daughter. Free. I can command the price of both our freedomes, And be you rul'd by me, you shall enjoy A greater happiness then liberty, By a new bondage but a sweeter, Good. If our thoughts agree, your promise crowns my wishes. Free. When we are free, I will unfold the riddle Before your Father, therefore my first care Shallbe we may enjoy an open aire. Exeunt. Enter Hog and Derrick. Hog. Sir, for my good old masters sake, I will Do what I can, but this our little fort Is so besieg'd with suiters, that I fear The Governness will be constrained to yield By open force, if she be not ensnared By some strange stratagem of Poetry. Der. I care not this for all their ribaldry, I never read of widow, won by ryming. Hog. This and another thing will do the feat Infallibly, but you shall hear a coppy Sent her this morning, which you will confesse Is very dangerous, thus it begins, Even as the heedless flye, seeking to taste The liquor glutinous, is taken fast Within the galli-pot, so wretched I Am caught, alas! by my viscosity, Labouring for life in love-lime, such is my lot For to be drown'd in Cupids galli-pot, Then call me as I am, 'tis all I crave, Sweet widow, thy intangled gally-slave, Who prayes to heaven, that by the stars direction We of two simples may make one confection. Der. This rascal talks like an Apothecary. Hog. He talks sir as he is, and 'tis more likely He will be worth his words, though he do promise Miracles in these verses following. I am no common suiter, thou shalt see I can do wonders by my facultie; My drugs thy you hand beauty shall ressore, Level those wrinckles, which age 'gins to score Vpon thy furrowed brow, thy fading hue, Cold bloud, decaying limbs, I will renew; Ceruss of asses milk and Mercury, Lac Virginis, but pedling trifles be To what I use; I give not by my art Colour alone, but strength to every part, Which work when I have finish't in thee, then I'le Idolize thy beauty with my pen. Der. And when this Idoll's set up by the Noddy I'le be the man shall worship her with my body. You see sir, I can rime too for a need. Hog. Sir I am glad of your abilities, Which may prevail, if that his threatning lines Writ in poetick rage, do not o're come her, When you have heard them with a judging ear, You cannot blame her if she love for fear: Thus he goes on. Yet know he begs who may command; my skill Can temper for thy scorn a draught shall fill Thy veins with rage, till thou hast spent a night In my Embrace, and dull'd it with delight, Love-sallets cropt by Circe and Medea Which Sagana with bold Canidia Gathered by moon-light in mount Esquiline Are but weak Philters, if compar'd with mine? Then think upon my power, and yield thy heart Rather toth'prayers of love, then strength of art, Your humble friend and servitour. Iohn Pestle. Der. This Pestle shall ne're pound i'th widows mortar. I care not for his sorc'ry, he conjures best Can raise an active spirit in her circle. Hog. 'Tis that his verses threaten, had she seen um I know not what effect they might have taken. Der. Has she not seen um then? nor ever shall; Thus ought seditious lines, haretical, Snatches um, And Magical doctrine to be abolisht. &amp; tears um, Hog. But for you friend, your ears shall feel, that they Are guilty too, of hearing of this doctrine, Der. Nay, prethee honesty be not offended, Here is a quarter Iacobin to buy Thee cooling Iulips to allay thy choler. Hog. I am appeas'd, now listen to the way How to obtain my Mrs. first you must Take no denyall, women often yield Sooner to importunity then reason. Der.
