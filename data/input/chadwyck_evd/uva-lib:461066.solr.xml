Gelon GrÃ¦me, Country Maiden. Maldie, Country Maiden. Isabel, Mother to Gelon GrÃ¦me. Martha, Mother to Gemel. Grimald, A Weird Woman. Nora, A Weird Woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT FIRST. SCENE I. Inside of a Cottage. Grimald and Nora, two weird women. Nora. Sister, we thrive. Grim. We'll mounch belyve; For the maidens long, and the witlings wive. Nora. To every link I have added seven; I bode of luck ere the hour eleven; The spirits are come, and the sign's in heaven. Grim. We'll thrive!âthrive! But never to shrive! Till the dew fall red and Moules arrive. Sister, sing to that. (They sing wildly.) We'll thrive, &amp;c. Nora. Sister, sisterâachieve! achieve! Steep the weft, and the searcloth weave! We may thrive and fear, and fear and thrive, But we'll never be safe while Gemel's alive. Grim. I fear him less than he fears me, For all his jargon and mockery. I have wrought well for Gemel's cross, I have earned him sorrow and loss,â I have earned him trouble and pain. Nora. Sister, curse him once again. Grim. Hear meâhear me, mighty Moules! When the bristle-cock sleeps, and the martin prowls, May all thy fays that rock in the tree, And all thy elves that hide on the lea,â That peep o'er the green leaf quaking high, Or out of the blue-bell wound with the eye, Prick and pierce him in nerve and spleen, By the arrows felt, but never seen; Then by flame unbodied burn him; Then on racking windlass turn him, Till his temples quiver and ache anew, And the cold sweat bell like drops of dew. Toil him and moil him, again and again! Sicken his heart, and sear his brain; Wear him away, and then!âand then! We'll thrive!âthrive! But never to shrive! Till the dew fall red and Moules arrive! (They sing wildly.) We'll thrive, &amp;c. Enter Hutchon. Hut. We'll brook your mirth, good womenâwarble on, Regard not me. Nora. Hutchon, I ween?âHow camest thou by our cot? You are most welcome to our poor abode. Hut. I came to ask your counselânay, and more, If you judge meet, to crave your kind assistance. My lord, whom I esteem, again is seized With that wild raving ardency of feeling Which erst assailed him, and which drives him on Close to the verge of dark insanity. The cause at this time is a beauteous maid, Hight Gelon GrÃ¦meâa most bewitching thing, Simple as weaned child.âI know full well Your power, and what effect your bodings have Among the rath young votaries to love, Who will be borrowing of futurity Shadows and counterfeits, which they must pay In different coinage. Grim. Speak thy mission, carl, And spare thy bald and sickening sophistry. Hut. This maiden shuns him, and rejects his suit. It seems she is betroth'd to that young hind, Who boasts such numerous flocks and herds, and has The hearts of all the maidens.âIf she wed, No anodyne will stay Lord Hindlee's mind From straying into pathless vacancy. Grim. What must we do?âname thy request and go. Hut. Could'st thou pronounce some high decree of fate,â Somewhat foretel to discompose the current, And mar the onward flow of these events, O it might save a noble mind from ruin, And thy reward thou only hast to name. Each word and token that have past between, I will supply withal, to give thy bodings Semblance of verity. Nora. (Aside.) Say nought of that Before our sisterâYou and I must fit Things to a natural channel; but with her All earthly help is scornedâNo hint of it,â Come to the festival at Isabel's. This night is Hallow-EveâI will be there.â Sister, wilt thou? Grim. Not I, For I can spy Things but conceived afar and nigh. My servitor has searching eye. (She waves her hand to Hutchon.) Stay not; list not; homeward hie. (Exit Hutchon, running.) Sister, we have the wind and the tide, Gemel the shepherd shall lose his bride. Moules has stole from kimmer's shelf Hornet spear, and arrow of elf.â Gemel the shepherd shall lose himself! Hail! hail! mighty Moules! King of the tempest that maddens and howls!â King of the spirits that flicker and play, And ride on the rack of the heaven away, Away! away!âfor ever and aye!â That ride on the rack of the heaven away. Sister, sing to that. (They sing.) Hail! hail! &amp;c. SCENE II. Enter Hutchon, listening. Hut. Beshrew my heart, if't does not palpitate And tremble at the figures and the looks Of these unnatural beings. They are crazed; Or else, indeed, they are two hags of hell. 'Tis plain old Grimald weens it so; she has So long imposed on others, it has grown Upon her own belief, till, by degrees, Her slender shreds of reason are o'erborne, And she imposes broadly on herself. Hark! how they chaunt their wild unholy rites To some dark power, framed by their fantasy! 'Tis said that oft the lated traveller hears These howls at midnight rising on the gale, And, mixing with the rushing sound that bursts From out the linn, makes most unearthly music. 'Tis imposition all! and yet I wot not How it should hapâbut they have chilled my blood, And I shall see their faces in my sleep. SCENE III. A Room in a Country house. Isabel, Gelon. Isa. Now, my loved Gelon, if Lord Hindlee come, And join our sports to-night, as is most like, Use him respectfully. Why should you fly, And shun the noble youth who loves you thus? Gel. Good mother, I love too; and women's love, Certes, ought to be much as men's respected. What boots Lord Hindlee's love to one like me? It cannot lead to good, and never shall From me have countenance. Enter Gemel, Maldie, Ben, and other Shepherds and Shepherdesses, all of the higher order. Isa. You're welcome, GemelâYou are welcome all. We longed much for you.âGive us all your hands. My Gelon here has been at pains to cull Each herb and flower of potent witchery, To lend variety unto your sports, And settle every weddingâevery kiss That is to hap within our valley's bound For one full year at least; and I have bid The women of the Linn, that they may read Each fair fulfilment properly and plain. Gem. Fie on th'imposing hags!âEre I beheld Their hateful forms, I'd rather look upon A toad, or any thing more loath'd by man. Isa. Ah! Gemel, Gemel! you will nought believe Of their malicious and most powerful spells! I needs must humour them, and pay them too, Else I would dearly buy itâYet I fear This is a sin in me; although, God wot, I dare not discontinue't. This same night, Had they not been invited, your gay sports Would all have ended in some rueful way. Gem. Oh shame! how can'st thou say so? Isa. You'll not believe; but sad experience Hath proved the truth to me. Gem. Come, let us have some music or a song Until the rest arriveâWhat say you to A song from Maiden Maldie? Omnes. (Clapping their hands). A song! a song! A song from Maldie, &amp;c. (Maldie sings.) Alone on the mountain poor Mona reclined, Her locks hung neglected and waved in the wind, On her face was a smile, though her reason had fled, And a tear on the wild-rose that hung o'er her head. The dew of the mountain, the wind, and the rain, Will ne'er cool the fever that burns in her brain! The Spring may the beauties of nature restore, But will beam on the mind of poor Mona no more! (During the Song Lord Hindlee and Hutchon enter softly.) Hind. Bless the sweet singer!âpeace to this fair group.â Maid, thou hast pierced my heart, for I have seen Thy Mona's very antitype. I had A sister once!âDame, you have seen my sister? Isa. Ah, yes! poor injured spirit! well I knew her! Heaven give her rest in its most happy home! Hind. I was but young thenâBut her mein and air, When her pure, fervent mind, began to waver And combat with distraction, never shall From my remembrance part!âI know I shall Sometime be in such erring state myself!â Dame, note me:âMy poor sister's not in heaven! She's still on earth; for I have seen her here Walk by my side, and look me in the face, Half-smiling; but a shade of woe, even then, Rests on her pallid cheek. 'Twas but last night! List to me, dame, I'll tell you what I saw. Gel. Oh, do not tell it now!âprithee, not now; 'Twill spoil our sports, my lord,âwe must be gay, And you shall join us. Hind. Say'st thou so, fair Gelon? Then since thou dost, I will join in them all. Sure he who would not join such purity, Deserves no happiness in this bad world, Nor in a better one. Gel. Hush, hush, my lord! You're sad, but yet you flatter.âOh, I fear You think not well of meâ'tis said the great Speak seldom as they think.âI know full well You think not as you say of me, my lord! Hind. O could I speak but one half that I think Of thy unequall'd beauty, and thy goodness! Enter Nora. Nora. Blithe be your sports; but you are laggards allâ Bustle! Be yare! you lose the best o'the night. The spirits are abroad, and tiptoe stand Listening your talk, and looking in your eyes To mark the currents of your inclinations, And how your fancies lie.âThey wait but word To answer you, or take the forms you like. Gemel. Thou old impostor! thou art ignorant As brutal instinct!âAs the shelled worm, Or grovelling mole that never sees the sun! Nora. Nay, now boy Gemel, thou know'st otherwise; Or, if thou dost not, shallâtake note of that. Gel. Gemel, thou'rt much mistaken.âShe knows more Than thou art ware ofâjoin us this one night And thou shalt hear her tell such things! Gemel. My Gelon, 'tis a grievous fault in thee, Thy constant trucking with these foolish hags. Gel. Join us to-night, I ask it as a favour. Gem. At your request, I will; but it shall be T'expose, and hold their skill up to contempt. Gel. First then, dear comrades, ere our darkling sports In barn-yard, and in kiln commence, old Nora here Shall read our fortunes roundâshe'll tell us more Than colwort, hemp-seed, and all freaks beside. Omnes. Yes, yes; our fortunes! our fortunes! Mine, wifeâGood Nora, mineâ Mine first, if you please. (They push their hands before one another.) Gem. Hold: let us try this mighty skill of hers. Our hands are much alikeâgo we all in, And one by one return, wrapt from her view; The palms alone be seenâI'll bet she gives Good, rich, and loving husbands to some men, And wives to women. Hut. 'Tis well conceived. As my best days are bye, I will attend And witness her mistakes. Omnes. Aye, aye, Hutchon shall witness. Hut. (Aside to Nora.) Fear not, thou shalt know all, And all of them; pray give it home to some. (Exeunt all but Nora. Hutchon stops and makes signs, to which she assents.) Nora. (Chaunts aloud.) Moules, be nigh! Be yare!âbe sly! Tickle the ear and itch the eye; And O, the trembling heart-strings ply, Till the little toiler torpid lie In the sickening wave of mystery. Re-enter Maldie wrapped in gown and hood, led by Hutchon, who makes signs to Nora. Ah, what a pretty palm!âHow white it is, And warm and moist!ânot over hard with work. Ah me! what's this I see!âO fie! O fie! (Maldie pulls in her hand.) Nay, show it meâI will say nothing out That is unmeet, but only in your ear. Oh, aye! Here's something of a Sunday eve, And of a braken bush, I see!âA ring! (She offers to pull away her hand.) A snood, a kerchief, garters fringed with gold! And oaths of love!âI see well how it is! A W and a B!âWho can it be? I would give much to know who owns this hand. The business rests not hereânor halfânor tenth: OneâTwoâThreeâFour! O love Bestow not all thy bounty upon one! (She pulls away her hand and whispers Hutchon aside.) Hut. She bids me ask if all of these are husbands? Nora. Would'st thou wish it truly?âlovers, lovers! Fear not, poor chuck, there is a husband here; A quiet man, I wotâSad doings though! But all's full closeâIt is a right fair fortuneâ Let me seeâBoysâFourâGirlsâGramercy! Hut. What? what? Nora. Childrenâchildrenâbrats. Hut. All to one husband? Nora. Oh! Ah! Must I tell all? Eh? Maldie runs offâEnter Gelon maskedâHutchon makes signs. Whom have we here?âA boy or girl is it? A very maid forsooth!âWho could have trowed? And such a fortuneâAh?âI like it not! A first love broken off, just at the time When hope was highâI am fully sorry for it; But it is inevitably fixedâgood sooth!â Oh there has been some ribbons gifted here! A gown of silk refused!âA diamond ring!â There must be some mistake. I'll say no more; Only, I see the present lover's cast. I'm sorry for him, though he has play'd false. Could I but learn whose was this hand, I might Name the new loverâI have etchings here, But 'tis so strange I dare not give it breath. (Gelon and Hutchon whisper.) Hut. She begs that you will tell her more of this. Nora. I dare not, 'tis so far beyond belief. Hut. She says she'll die if you tell her no more. Who is to be her husband? Who play'd false? Nora. She will not credit meâgo, go away, Haply we'll find it out before the morrow. (Exeunt Gelon and HutchonâRe-enter Hutchon and Gemel masked.) Here is an honest handâ(pause)âAh! what do I see? (Screams.) Ah!âOh! Oh!âI'll look no more. O such a sight!âbring me some water, Hutchon. Why do you take me unawares, and force me To look on things enough to blench the sight Of vision'd eye for ever?âTell me not, Nor ever let me know whose is that hand. Hut. Its owner begs you'll only mention that You deem'd you sawânor farther makes request. Nora. I saw no bride-bed but a winding-sheet; I saw a coffin with a fringed lid; I read it: It was Aged 23. Oh, I am sick!âI must into my cot. Good sport, and fair fore-tokens to you all. (Exit Nora.) Hut. Such uncompounded stuff! Out on the hag! If I not tremble at her. Gem. (Much troubled.) Not I: I heed her not;âbut such a rede! Hut. Be not cast down; 'tis sheer imposture all. Gem. I know itâI know itâstuff, stuff. (The rest enter.) Hut. Our oracle is goneâwe were too hard For her familiar. Omnes. Oh, what a loss! I am miss'd; and I, &amp;c. Hut. Now may I tell the fortunes she has given. First, to Dame Maldieâ Mal. (Stopping him.) Ah, Hutchon, for thy life! No word of mine: I would not for the world. Ah! I shall ne'er forget!âWe little know What is laid before us: some have much to do! And much to bear!âWho will go home with me? I shall not go alone to-night! Ben. Thou well know'st who will. Mal. Think'st thou I'll go with thee? Hut. Then to our Gelon she foretoldâ Gel. (Stopping him). Hold, Hutchon! for my sake, oh, do forbear! I canot suffer it. But tell us Gemel's.â So, Master Gemel, you have play'd me false; But you'll be paid in kind! Gem. Me? Gel. Aye, me! Why else does me look so pale? Ah! I have found you out! Does Nora now Know nought that is to be, or that has been? Gem. I need not care. Gel. And think you I do?âsooth! Mal. She knows each thing we do: she told me all I ever did; and much that no one knows But I alone. Hut. Yes; another. Mal. No other living. Hut. What? Of the ring, you know? and braken bush? And Sunday evening too? Mal. Oh, these were liesâall lies. Hut. What part then was the truth, I wonder much? Mal. She is an odd woman! Gel. A most wonderful woman! Mal. Her foresight reaches far far onward. Gel. Her sister's wisdom soars a thousand times Higher than her's, beyond the stars and moon; But she is strange, mysterious, and reserved. Come to our sportsâwe lose our timeâaway! (Exeunt all but Isabel and Hindlee.) Hind. Dame, I am ill at easeâmake my excuse To these fair maidens. That which should me move To gaiety and mirth outdoes itself; Winds up the chords of feeling till they rack To listless apathy; and all within Becomes a reeling dizzy wilderness. Oh, 'tis unbrookable, that cumbrous growth! That giant of the mind, that heaves and swells, Till scarce a form of nature can be traced Within its dark and hideous magnitude. Adieu, good dame, commend me to your daughter. Isa. I often have done so; but you have never Made proffer that a mother may commend. Hind. I love her as I love myself, good dame, And much, much better! Isa. Sure you would never wish possess my child But by the privilege of holy wedlock? Hind. I would not sully such a gem for worlds; And wed with her, I dare notâOh! No, no! My heart is torn!âDost thou believe in visions? Isa. Ay, that I do, as truly as I credit Aught that I see or hear. Hind. When thou wert young, If one thou knew'st in life had come again From out the grave, and stood up by thy side, And smiled on thee, and told thee thou should'st live To kill thy husband, would'st thou have believed it? Isa. O never, never!âthat was not in nature. I would have view'd it as it wasâA plot Of man's great enemy to thwart the right, To maze my mind and lead me into error. Hind. I bless thee for that thoughtâDame, thou art wise, Upright, and shrewd: I honour thee for this. O thou hast taken a weight from off my heart That did oppress me.âI will wed thy daughter Next monthânext weekâto-morrow if you will: This and my love to her.âAdieu, good dame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT SECOND. SCENE I. âAs before. Enter Shepherds and Maids as before, laughingâ the former carrying long stalks of Colwort. Gelon. Ha, ha! such brave mates as our lads have got! 1st Shep. By my life, but mine is a strapper! 2d Shep. See what a crooked carling I have got! Confound her!âwitch!âwho can this be? Ben. Mine has neither root nor branch; A dry, bare, barren wilderness mine is! Look at it, beauteous Maldieâthis is you. Mal. Begone, you naughty thing!âit is not me: My fortune's otherwise, I'd have you know. Ben. I think it is youâsee to what you'll turn: A wither'd bargain I shall have of you! Gel. But where is Gemel's? Gemel has got none; Poor man! he gets no wife at all! Gem. Sooth, I forgot!âI will go seek one now. Ben. What ails you, Gemel? you are not yourself; Some sickly, thoughtful mood oppresses you. Gem. I never was so well, nor yet so merry. Ha, ha! what a runt Ben has got. Ha, ha! (Forces a laugh.) Gel. This is unprofitable gameâWe get A laugh, but nothing more. Ben. And pray, what more would Madam Gelon have? Gel. Say, maidensâwould it not be better play That brought our lovers in before our eyes? Omnes. Oh, far, far better!âLet us to that! Mal. I love to see the fellows face to face. Ben. And I the maidensâCome, let's have the sleeve. Maldie?âCome hither, my loved Maldie: list, We may meet face to face without the sleeve. Mal. I tell you, go; I'll none of you; I would not speak nor look to such a thing,â A faithless flatterer that changes still. Come, let us wake the slieve.âIs there a stream Near by that runs straight southward? Ben. Yes, the burn of the linnâstraight south. Gel. There will we dip the sleeve, and watch it there With the wierd women; they will manage all Most properly, and sure to the effect. Gem. Oh, by all means!âwe'll go And try them once again, I long for that. Gel. How you are alter'd in so short a time! Gem. Pray you, let me go first, I do entreat. Gel. No; all must go by chanceâhere cast we lots. (They draw lots.) Gel. Maldie is first again; she is to be The first a bride. Ben. How you miscalculate! The first is aye the lastâthe last the first. I will not have her for seven years at least. Mal. And who would wait that time for such a man? Look at him, comrades! who would wait for him? Would any living wait for shred like that? Ben. (Fetching his runt.) Here is the prototypeâpray look at this! What comeliness is here! Ah, Maldie! lookâ (Exit Maldie.) I'll steal away and watch behind the wall To see what form my Maldie's lover is. (Exit Ben on the other side.) SCENE II. The Witches' Cot. Grimald and Nora. Grim. Sister, little do ye ken! Seek buttâseek benâ I feel the sa'r of Christian men. Nora. It is our help-mate in his den; A spirit of a wonderous guise, Who must not be seen by Christian eyes; We have him safe, and, come who will, Unimpeached stands our skill. Enter Maldie. Ah! whom have we here, With her dripping shift-sleeve? Mal. I want to see him bodily.âWe all Are coming to you, one by one, to watch The new-wash'd sleeve, and see our future loves. Grim. Go, girl!âYou are too fond!â'Tis shame of you! Not yet full fledged!âBut looking o'er the nest, And conjuring for lovers!âGet thee gone! Nora. Nay, nay! Dame Maldie must have lover too, Like other women!âIt must have a husband, Sweet elf, to teaze and vex it!âMake it weep And laugh!âDeface its fair and youthful bloom, And make a drudge o't! Oh it must have husband! And children too, to puke and mewl so sweet, And keep it waking!âthese must all be had! There is no peace else. Mal. 'Tis only sport, a freak of Hallowmass. Nora. Give me thy sleeveâThou shalt not wake it long; But if thy fortune please not, we are blameless. (She waves the Sleeve backward and forward round the Fire.) Now, while we stand and wave the hand, Sister, give the high command. Grim. Hear me!âHear me! Moules of might! Come with thy gillenours of the night;â Come like a beetle, or come like a bee;â Come by the latch, or the bore of the key, Or sit like an ousel upon the crook tree; And tell the fairest of all thy band, The loveliest elf of the faery land,â To filch the gossamer's airy shroud And a shred of the rainbow out of the cloud, And make him a form by maiden approved, Of youth that loves and is beloved; See, I wave my charmed wandâ Comeâcome, at this maiden's command. Mal. Whoever is my true-love to be, Come and turn over this sleeve for me. Voice. Be dumb!âbe dumb! I hide in the lumb! No maiden calls, and I will not come. Grim. So young! so fair! it may not be; No mark of falsehood do I see. Lying lurker! thy riddle explain; Tell me how, and tell me when. Mal. No, no, so please you; of the past be dumb, I know't already; tell me what's to come. Grim. See, I wave my sceptral wand, Come at this fair May's command. Voice. 'Tis a wide term!âI come, I come; As the cat be sharp,âas the bat be dumb. (One, habited like Ben, comes gliding in behind them: He turns the Sleeve, and walks off at the other side.) Mal. Whence did he come?âOut of the earth? Nora. Out of the wall.âFrom this small hole I saw him glide, like a thin piping reek. I think we all have seen the face before. Mal. Aye often, Nora! and, 'twixt you and I, There is no face I like so well to see. (Ben puts his head in at a hole behind them.) Ben. (Aside.) Ah! she's my jewel yet, for all that's past! (To them.) I've seen the whole.âAh! Maldie, yon was me. Mal. (Screams.) Ah!âO, Grimald, witch that naughty man. What seek you there, you prying, low-lifed thing? Still haunting me, while knowing I detest you.â Ben. But not the less you liked to see my face. Mal. It was not you, vain fool! nor nothing like. Dost ween that ever such a form was thine? It was a gentleman in mien and form. Ben. Now, by this hand, If I had met it in the open field, I could not have distinguished who was who, It was so like me. Mal. Go, get you gone, youâcreature! Ben. Oh! oh! mumps, mumps, Miss Mumps. Mal. If I come to you, I shall make you go. (Exit Maldie.) Nora. But you'll go with him.âO what woeful stuff! I wot the strife will not be dangerous. Grim. Fond, hectic triflers!âThey are all to me As cats, or something baser,âgarbage all! I could as lief for puppets feel regard: Nor would I see them, were it not to wreck, And set them groping headlong in the mist That shades the futureâMake them moult forsooth! Fie on the nestlings! Enter Gelon. Nora. Ha! here's our own sweet Gelon, with her sleeve Well wash'd and wrung, and ready for the spell. Is't the left sleeve that lies across the heart? If not, 'tis worthless.âAye, this is the thing! Now, note we well what comes.âThere's something strange Connected with your fortune, Gelon.â Here let us stand with lifted hand; Sister, give the high command. Grim. King of the night-wind, come away.â Come not like gier or ouphen gray;â Come not like crazed or eildron wight;â Come in youthful guise bedight, Most pleasant to this maiden's sight!â While thus I wave my charmed wand, Come at this fair maid's command. Gel. Whoever is my true-love to be, Come and turn over this sleeve for me. (While they are waiting attentively, a slight noise is heard; and while they are attending to that, enter one, habited like Lord Hindlee, who turns the sleeve quickly, and goes off at the other side. They see him only as he retires.) Grim. Kempy's come, and also gone! My power is to myself unknown! There was a man, and there is none, And the place is a void that he stood upon! Gel. Who was he? or what like?âDid'st see his face? Grim. But indistinctly, for I see not well. How grew your strange neglect? Gel. I cannot tell. O bring him back, I'll scan him o'er and o'er.â Bring him again, dear Grimald. Grim. A twelvemonth you must wait ere that may be. Gel. A twelvemonth!â'tis an age!âI cannot bear it. O, GrimaldâNora, call him; he will come. Grim. No, noâNo more. He will not come but most reluctantly. Gel. O you are cursed, and cruel, both of ye. My fancy's all on tiptoe, and my mind Stretch'd on the rack.âSure you will pity me. Grim. Art thou a Christian? Gel. Certes; how darest thou ask? Grim. He will not come again! or, if he do, The vision's fraught with danger. True, I can Force him, by spells of potent gramarye, To rise again, if thou darest wait the issue. Gel. There is not aught I will not brave t'allay This thirst inquisitive.âI have no fear Of form that I must love.âNay, on my life, I'd give all in this world I can call mine To gain the chance I've lost. Grim. Then be it so; When thy comrades go,â Long ere the cock begins to crow,â Unlatch the door and come to me; But note thou well when the time must be. When the cricket sings beyond the hearth, And the little glow-worm pearls the earth;â When Charles of Norway has lash'd his wain Around by the west, and the north again, To plow the gleam of the eastern main;â When the seven stars the midnight have driven Across the crown of the hoary heaven, And hang like an ear-ring studded bright Upon the left cheek of the night;â When Moules, in mantle of silver gray, Rides on the belt of the starry ray, Or sits on the clough of the milky-way; Then come to me, and thou shalt see The man that is thy lord to be. (Exit Gelon.) Nora. Sister, though they deem us poor, How high we stand above the boor! When Gemel comes, exert thy power. Enter Gemel. Welcome, good Gemel, you I joy to see: We never erst your fortune have explored; I hope it will be good. Gem. Read me the truth, be what it may; But well I know that nought will answer youâ It's all imposture. Nora. Be not too sureâgive me the sleeveâ Now let us stand with lifted hand; Sister, give the high command. Grim. Master, for thy honour hear: I see by the roof-tree thou art nearâ Tell thy henchman elf to change, And all its form anew arrange; Come not here with lordly grin, With whisker'd cheek and bearded chin; But come in youtheid's fairest time, Like maiden in her virgin prime. The rose-leaf for her cheek go win, And the apple-blossom for her chin; Her lips be the berry ripe and red, With the honey gleam around it shed; Her brow be the lily that courts the sun, And her breast the curd that's newly won; And O be her eye the sphere of dew, That little hare-bell cups embrue, As mild, as radiant, and as blue. See, I wave my magic wand, Come at this fair youth's command. Gem. Whoever is my true love to be, Come and turn over this slieve to me. (Pause.) Grim. So thou refusest, elfin gier! Come forth, thou churlish pioneer! Come out of thy bores the truth to show, Or I'll ferret thee out by the hounds below. See, I wave my sceptral wand, Come, come at this youth's command. Gem. Whoever is my true love to be, Come and turn over this sleeve for me. (A white sheet appears for a moment at a corner.) Nora. Ha! saw'st thou that? Gem. What? I neither saw nor heard aught. Nora. Then bless thyself: For had'st thou seen what I saw now, thou ne'er Had'st look'd on happiness again. Gem. 'Tis thus you mock us with your low deceits, You mindless, grovelling hags! Did I not say, And truly say, you were most rank impostors? Grim. Talk not of mind to me! Were thine and all thy kindred's minds embodied, My soul could swallow the crude morsel up Without distention.âSuch a colt as thee To talk of mind! Gem. Thou art a sheer impostor; Coarse and unpolish'd. Thou call spirits up! Yes! you may call a catâand she may come When you do call on herâfarther thou can'st not. Nora. Now let me beg of thee, call not again, 'Tis fraught with destiny; and now I dread Yours was the hand I sawâcall not again. Remember 'tis the third time. Gem. A fair excuse! Thou canst not even make a cat appear; Here I defy thee to make aught appear. How thou art outed, witch!âWhat can'st thou say For thy fore-knowledge and thy influence now? Poor woman! pray do call spirits up. Grim. (Aloud.) Spirit of destinyâcomeâappear, Of mind or reason have thou no fear. Come like the spirit that journeys the cloud; Come in thy cerement, or come in thy shroud; Or like the figure of death come in, With nerveless bones and skeleton grin. When this proud youth gives order to thee, Show him the truth whatever it be. (Pause.) Call; why dost thou not?âThou darest not call! Gem. (Hesitating.) Whoever is my true love to be, Come and turn over this sleeve for me. (A Coffin appears, and on its lid is seen in large characters,âJ. Gemel, aged 23.âGemel faintsâscene closes.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THIRD. SCENE I. A Room. Enter Lord Hindlee in a Night Gown. Hind. To what new horrors is my mind ordain'd! O that this night were past, and a new day Would ope its eye on this deranged world, Where human things, and beings without mould Or earthly quality, together blent, Move in confusion!âWould the night were over, That day-light might dispel them!âSuch a night I shall not brook again. (He fixes his eyes on a part of the Room and speaks as to one.) Ha! art thou there? Still am I haunted?âO thou mournful shade, Pale as thy winding sheet! why do'st thou look On me with such concern? Is there aught more Of horror in the onward paths of fate That I must act? Nay, come thou near to me, Come to my side, for now I fear thee not,â Thy form's familiar grownâCome nigh to me, And tell thy message in my longing ear. Poor pallid shade, thine errand must be done! (He listens as to one speaking.) The same old rote!âWhy thou hast told me so A thousand times!âWhy harp upon it thus, For ever, and for ever? (He listens again and answers.) Well, be it soâYes; be it as thou wilt. (Listens.) What? I assent? No, never! This same night Thou hast repeated it till I am callous; But my assent thou never shalt obtain! Woe, that a form so saint-like, thus should preach Nothing but blood and murder!âHenceâAvaunt! Thou art some fiend that borrowest the shape Of her I once held dearâO God! what do I see? O horror! she I love stretch'd at my feet In the agonies of death, and on her breast A deadly wound!âand say'st thou it was I? I'll fly to the earth's end!âWould that I could Fly from myself, or every sense shut out! Once more I'll view the hideous sight, that it May freeze the very vital current up, And reason's last poor sheltering place uproot, Driving her to the desert. (He steals off, keeping his eye wildly fixed on a certain part of the floor.) SCENE II. The Witches' Cot. Discovers Grimald, Nora, and Gelon, standing by a Fire, at which is placed a Waxen Image. Gel. Are these unearthly orgies done? Grim. Scarce begun!âScarce begun!â Come, sing one other strain with me, To charm the spirit of destiny. (They sing slowly and wild.) Where art thou? Where art thou? Busy Spirit, where art thou Weaving the fates of mortals now? Where art thou? &amp;c. Grim. (Speaks.) Where art thou? Where art thou? Busy Spirit, where art thou Weaving the fates of mortals now? Art thou beneath the ocean wave, Scraping the sea-weeds from the grave Where the merry sailor must shortly lie? Or art thou gone to bustle and ply Where flaring standards flap the sky, Working thy baleful web of woe, Or binding wreaths for the hero's brow? Or art thou gone to heaven above, Away to the waning star of love, To skim the dew-web from the tree, Of which the golden skene shall be That guides the lover's destiny? Or watchest thou the stripling's bed, Or the couch where maiden beauty is laid, With dreams their feelings to suborn, And sprinkle from thy living urn The kindred spark that long shall burn? Spirit! wherever thou may'st be, Or gone to the caves beneath the sea, Or flown the wild sea-rock to haunt And scare the drowsy cormorant; Whether thou rangest vale or steep, Or watchest mellow beauty's sleep, The monarch's throne, or the field of death, The world above, or the world beneath, We ask thy welcome presence here, ComeâComeâAppearâAppear. (Pause.) I see thee notâI cannot see The slightest shade or drapery Of fate's own herald, known to me. O come like a feeling, or come like a sound, Or come like an odour along the ground; Come like a film of floating blue, Or come like the moss-crop's slightest flue, Or glimmering rack of the midnight dew. We wait thee motionless and dumbâ Come, O gentle Spirit! come. (Pause.) Oh me! there is trouble and torsel here; Some countervailing spirit is near, Who will not let the gye appear. Sister, go to the door and see; Note the sound that comes from the tree, And the vapour that sleeps on the midnight lea. Note if the shred of silver grey Floats o'er the belt of the starry ray, Or streams in the cleft of the milky-way. And look between the north and the east For the star above the mountain's crest That changes still its witching hue,â Note if it's green, or red, or blue. (Exit Nora.) This is a night of mystery! Maiden, say a hymn with me. (They sing soft and slow.) Thou art weary, weary, weary! Thou art weary and far away! Hear me, gentle Spirit, hear me! Come before the dawn of day! Thou art weary, &amp;c. Re-enter Nora. [Grim.] Say, bodes the night's eye well or ill? Nora. I heard a small voice from the hill; The vapour is deadly, pale, and still. A murmuring sough is on the wood, And the little star is red as blood. Moules sits not on his throne to-night, For there is not a hue of the grizly light; But in the cleft of heaven I scan The giant form of a naked man; His eye is like the burning brand, And he holds a sword in his right hand. Grim. All is not well! By dint of spell, Somewhere between the heavens and hell, There is this night a wild deray, The spirits have wandered from their way! And the purple drops shall tinge the moon As she wanders through the midnight noon; And the dawning heaven shall all be red With aerial blood by angels shed. Be as it will, I have the skill To work by good, or to work by ill. (They prick the Image alternately with sharp bodkins.) Take that for pain! Nora. And that for thrall! Grim. And that for conscience, the worst of all! If spirits come not, mortals shall! Another chaunt, and then, and then, From the but or from the ben, Spirits shall come or christian men. (They chaunt.) Where is Gil-Moules, Where is Gil-Moules, Works he not save when the tempest howls? Where is Gil-Moules, &amp;c. Grim. (Speaks.) Sleep'st thou, wakest thou, lord of the wind? Mount thy steeds and gallop them blind, Leave the red thunder-bolt lagging behind; And the long-tail'd fiery dragon outfly, The rocket of heaven, the bomb of the sky; Over the dog-star, over the wain, Over the cloud and the rainbow's mane; Over the mountain and over the sea, Haste, haste, haste to me! (They pierce the Figure alternately.) Take that for trouble! Nora. And that for smart! Grim. And that for the pang that seeks the heart! Nora. That for madness! Grim. And that for thrall! And that for conscience, the worst of all! (Here Lord Hindlee enters furiously, half-naked âhe runs his Sword through the Breast of the Figure and overturns itâthen, in distracted mood, breaks away, leaving his Sword sticking in the Image.âPause.) Grim. (With raptures.) Hail to thee! hail to thee, Spirit of might! I judged thee deft, and I judged aright! But ah! I knew not half thy might! Not half so high had been my wonder If thou had'st cleft the earth asunder, And risen thyself from out the cell In any shape of earth or hell! But that the sons of men, submiss Should leave their couch of happiness; That knights and kings should quit their rest, And trace the night at thy behest, I knew it not! O, Spirit high, Thine are the workings of destiny!â Bless thee, fair lady of Hindlee towers, (Kneeling to Gelon.) These hills, these vales, and all are yours. Nora. Great joy and peace to thine and thee, True love and high felicity; No more our own dear Gelon GrÃ¦me, But Lady Hindlee shall be thy name. Gel. Ah me! I fear there is great offence; I wish that I were safely hence! Grim. No evil thing shall thee perplex, Thou hast a spirit above thy sex, Above the common race of manâ What pity thou art Christian! Thou can'st not soar in time of need To deal with spirits or with the dead! Or cause these mighty beings rise, These great controuling energies! O high should be thy gifted meed Would'st thou renounce that shallow creed. Gel. Let me be gone! If I had known The half of what I have look'd upon, I had never come here at midnight lone! Grim. Preserve that sword from human eye, With it is twined thy destiny; And wear upon thy bridal-day This wounded scarf with the silver splay, Else thou from bride-bed may'st be won By elves this night that were outdone. Whenever thy husband grows less warm, Throw on this scarf; it has a charm That soon the flame will renovate Of mighty love, though turn'd to hate; But never, while life and breath remain, This sword and scarf must meet again! Else woe to thee, and woe to me! And woe to all that both shall see! The hour thou givest this secret birth, It is thy last upon the earth.â (Exit Gelon with the Scarf and Sword.) What thinkest thou? Nora. I did not trow Thou hadst such wonderous power till now. What is there that we may not do? Grim. Woe that we in the wild should won, Where nothing mighty can be done! Nothing of note or potence great, Else nations should our deeds relate! But pining death shall seize the flocks, And the raven's voice among the rocks Shall with exultings fill the air, And drown the shepherd's bootless prayer; The halter shall moulden in the stall, And the plaid hang useless on the wall; The hills shall split, and the thunder come, And lightnings strike the Christian dumb. Oh, how I farther long to know The power of the spirits here below! (Kneeling.) Hail to thee!âhail to thee, Spirit of power! Thine is the might at the witching hour!â Thine is the ear that was never defined, The eye of the eagle, the speed of the wind! To love thee and prove thee is all that I claim, Until my release from this cumbersome frame: Then, O how I'll joy, over land, over sea, Over tempest and torrent, to revel with thee! An impulse, or presence, unnoted to stand By nest of the raven, or throne of the land; Then bound through the firmament, lightsome and boon, To sail on the comet, or sleep in the moon! Hail to thee!âhail to thee! Spirit of wonder!â Of the spectre, the dreamâof the storm and the thunder! SCENE III. A dark Hall. Isabel without, knocking. Isa. Open the door to me!âOpen the door Without delay!âOh! you are sleeping, are you? 'Tis well! 'tis well! But you shall have a waking!â Open the door! or, by the rood, I'll raise A flame shall roast you living in your dens, You most unhallow'd sleepers!âOpen the door! Enter Hutchon half-dressed, with a light. Hut. What is the tumult?âWhy this wild alarm? Isa. Wilt thou not open to me, Hutchon? Hut. Certes I will, good dame. (Opens.) What drives you here At this untimeous hour of night? Isa. My daughter, Hutchon!âMy loved Gelon GrÃ¦me!â O I have lost my child!âBut she is hereâ I know it, Hutchon!âSay that she is here, And all shall be made up. Hut. Here she is not, I pledge my word, good dame,â My truth to you, and honour of my lord. How, when, or why, deem'st thou that she is lost? And why dost thou charge me with it?âSay all. Isa. I thought I had new slept; yet I had dream'd Of grievous trouble; dreaming still I was When some disturbing sounds awakened me. I listened close, and at my eastern door, Or Gelon's lattice, which I could not tell, I heard Lord Hindlee's voice,ânot in the mood Of soothing, or of kindness, but in rage. Loudly he seem'd to threaten and adjure: I heard no more; trembling, a while I lay; Then rising, to my daughter's bed I went In chill suspense.âO, Hutchon, judge my case, The sheets were cold, and Gelon was not there!â Where is Lord Hindlee? Hut. In his chamber, dame; His voice thou did'st not hear; 'tis all a dream. Isa. O do not mock me, Hutchon; as I live, And look you in the face, I heard his voice. Go, search his chamber straight; mine is a case That brooks no scrupleâstays no ceremony. (Exit Hutchon.) If he had spoke as he was wont to her, I had held light of this.âI know his honour; But as it was, I know not what to think. Re-enter Hutchon. Hut. Alas! good dame, too true was that you said! My lord is gone, half-naked, it would seem, And in his hand a sword; for on the floor I found this scabbard flung, and it was empty. Isa. Gone with his sword!âOh me, my child, my child!â What can this mean, dear Hutchon? Hut. Beshrew me, if I guess!âMy lord last night Was much disturb'd in mind. We'll raise the village straight, and all the vale;â I fear some horrid deedâHush!âhush!â I hear some one approach. Enter Hindlee, smiling vacantly, habited as before. How now, my lord?âHow dost thou? Hind. I'm better nowâI'm wellâquite wellâ I never felt so well.âO I have had A most pernicious dream! Hut. And did you walk forth in your sleep, my lord? Hind. It seems I have. O I had such a dream!â I would meet hell in countertime before I braved again a vision of such woe. Hut. But are you sure it was a dream, my lord? Where is your sword? Hind. I left it sticking in her breastâI slew her, And then the charm was gone.âI slew her thus, And down she sunk in death.âI left it there, Stuck through her breastâI did not pull it thenceâ I know not why, but there I left it sure. And she is gone!âI had it still to do! Now it is done, I shall be happier far In the extreme of misery.âAh me!â Slain! slain!âNow it is done indeed! Hut. Who, my good lord?âPray, who is slain? What dost thou mean? Hind. Oh, I forgot!âIt was a dream. But ah! it was a dreadful one. Isa. Where is my childâmy Gelon?âWhere is she?â What dost thou talk of slaying?âO, my lord, Tell me where is my child?âI heard thy voice, And know thou took'st her from me. Hind. Took who?âthy child?âWhere am I? Sure this is mine own hall.âWhere have I been?â Tell me, good dame?âSpeak, Hutchon, what is this? Isa. Didst thou not see my child?âSpeak, my good lord! Hind. I think I did.âIs this not all a dream? Hut. That thou art here I see; that thou wert hence I know, and hadst thy sword.âAlas! I dread Some fatal work is done. Hind. If I was hence in body as in mind, And had my sword, then I have done a deed That fiends will blush for! Yet I cannot trow That it is over: That it was to hap I long have known; but time as yet is green; The withering winds of incident must come,â The night-dews bleaken, and the burning sun Pass over it, and sear it in the ear, And the last blade of healthful reason drop, Ere yet it ripen, ere it come to this. Would God this were the last, that it were over, Then should I know the worst! Hut. This is mere raving.âRecollect, my lord, If you have seen or heard of beauteous Gelon, And where you left her. Hind. Beauteous, indeed!âOh even in death how lovely!â Hutchon, I love that maid;âI may not say How muchâbetter than all the earth beside;â Alas! I fear, better than heaven itself! Hut. Beauteous in death!âHast thou then seen her dead? Hind. Dost thou ask that?âAn hundred times I have! And dying tooâYes, I have seen her die! The life-blood streaming from her breast!âher looks Fix'd ruefully on me! and then methought I felt an inward joy that God's decree Was done, and I his minister,âa joy it was Of vacant desperation.â I'll go to rest, for I am weary, dame.â Watch with me, Hutchon, I shall dream again; And if thou seest me quiver, or outstretch My limbs as in convulsion, waken me; Or should my open eyes whiten, and turn Round in their sockets, or my deepen'd breath Cut short, and mix with inarticulate sounds, Oh wake me forthwith! else my struggling soul Again may bear my passive body hence, To do I know not what. Ah! it was sudden!â The inmates were astonished at the deed! Methinks I see their eyes even yet! Hut. From this we nothing gain.âHis words and thoughts Hang on some dread uncertainty.âI hope, And yet I fear; for such unhallow'd thought Could not thus feed even on distemper'd mind Without a resting point.âDame, hie thee home, Call up the cottagers, make active search, And soon as Hindlee is composed to rest, I'll join thee in the scrutiny of this. SCENE V. A Room in a Country House. Gemel, Martha. Mar. How is it with thee, son? Tell me thy ail. Somewhat preys deeply on thy mind and health; Tell it thy mother; all that thee concerns Concerns her more.âHas thy beloved maid Discarded thee?âThou answer'st not to that!â I see it all!âI see it!âAh, my son! Thou little know'st of women!âthink not of it. It is our way; whene'er we take offence We love the mostâThink not of that, my son. Gem. My Gelon is all purity and truth, But she must ne'er be mine.âConsider well, And tell me once again, what is mine age? Mar. I told theeâTwenty-threeâWhy dost thou start? Gem. Already twenty-three!âSure thou mistakest! Thy reckoning hath outrun the march of time For one full year at leastâI know it hasâ Say one year less, and I will bless thee, mother. Sit down, and state to me the year, the day. Mar. That can I well, for well may I remember! It was that year the Kerrs and Turnbulls rode: Thy father join'd themâAh! that was a year That I shall ne'er in life forget!âIt was A bloody, a severe, and stormy one! The sheep fell down with hungerâfor the snow Lay till the suns of April master'd it. The shepherds of the dale gather'd their dead, And built them up for shelters to the living: But all could nought avail!âThat was a year Not soon to be forgot!âI nursed thee then On my young breast, and sore perplex'd I was, Not knowing how to guide theeâWhen I woke I found thee often roll'd aside, and lying Like little chubby snow-ball, sound asleep. But nought could hurt theeâsuch a healthy boy, Or happy little elf, I ne'er beheld: When I awoke thee, thou would'st crow and smile, And pat my bosom with thy little hand Cold as an icicle. O how my heart Yearn'd over thee, and clung to thee!âWho knows A mother's joys who has not been a mother! Gem. Is that aught to the question which I put? Mar. That was thy native year.âNow for the dayâ No, not the dayâthe night, I should have said; It was by night,âa Sabbath-night it was,â The week before the king came o'er the waterâ Aye, I remember well!âThou art, my son, To-morrow morn, three-quarters of an hour Before the cock crowâtwenty yearsâand four. Gem. (Starting up, and greatly agitated.) O God of heaven, so soon!âThen I am gone!â Yes, I must leave thee, mother, ere that time! I saw it with my eyes in characters Of deadly whiteness, âAGED TWENTY-THREE.â Mar. What dost thou mean? and whither goest thou? Unsay that word; for, if thou leavest me, Gemel, Thou seal'st thy parent's doom. Gem. It is too true.âThat I must go, I know; But whither I know not.âAll that thou seest Of me will not go far; a lowly home Hard by will be my dwelling.âWoe is me! Oh I am sick at heart! Mar. If these thy words Have any meaning, I perceive it not. Speak to me, Gemel; say some cheering word, For all my blood runs cold. Gem. Then well may mine! Oh that I could unknow it!âthat I could Close up the hideous chasm which I have made Through the unbless'd and ever-folding shroud That veils the terrors of futurity! Then might I hope even to the last, and meet Death all unaw'd, and step from this existence Into another, scarce discerning it. But thus to know itâthus to be assured That ere another night is overpast I must lay down this warm and feeling frame, And be something I know not!âTo give up all The joys of life, and love, which never man Held in such estimate!âTo know all this, Inflicts a death-pang every moment, till The weary heart, o'ercome with sufferance, Longs for the appointed hour that brings it rest, Or change of feeling, never to change more. And my poor Gelon, I must leave her too, All loving as she is!âAnd thee, my mother, Helpless and unprotected, here alone! Mar. Talk'st thou of death, and that so seriously? This is some dream or frenzy; thou art well, Or slightly indisposed.âO, my loved son, No more of such illusions let me hear. Gem. Oh, it is seal'd and register'd beneath, As well as in the heavenâso it would seem! I'm not more certain that I live and breathe, And speak to you, than that to-morrow night, Before the eastern star, by shepherds named The Counter of the Sky, hath gained the cope, The zenith of the middle heaven, I shall Be lying low indeed!âThis conscious frame, So full of keen sensation, that the sting Of insect can molest it, all unbraced And torpid, shall be stretch'dâIf I not knew, Why it is naught;âbut the poor criminal, All hopeless of reprieve, is not more cast And wretched than am I.âDeath still is death; The manner of that death to him assured Avails but little. Mar. But here comes one will charm thee back to life, And drive that sullen boding mood away. Enter Gelon. Welcome, dear Gelon, we have need of thee; Thy Gemel's mind is sore disturb'd, but thou Bring'st ever with thee cure for all his ails. Gem. Welcome, dear Gelon.âTrue, my mind is sad, But to that sadness thou add'st grievously. Gel. Dost thou already know that we must part? Gem. Alas, too well! It is decreed, my Gelon. Gel. Deem'st thou that heaven is kind in this?âI could Yield all the earth beside for love of thee; And yet must give thee up.â Gem. Do not repine, 'Tis vain to strive against the will of heaven,â What is ordain'd, must, and will come to pass. Gel. I came to warn thee of our hapless lot; It glads me that thou know'st and art resign'd. Why grow'st thou paler?âI may not remain, Else our meek acquiescence all will fly, And we shall vainly war with Providence. Adieu, my Gemel,âfate may sever us, But ne'er shall drive thy image from my heart. This is the last embrace we may indulge. Adieu, my Gemel! (Exit Gelon.) Gem. Yes, it is the last! And she, too, knows of it!âmy doom is public, As his who dies for treason!âThat dear maid Grieves me the most of allâWhen I am gone, Regard her as thine own. Mar. You both are mad, Or else possess'd by some wild witchery! The Women of the Linn have hand in this; I'll send for them. Gem. If e'er within this door One of these hags set footâMy doom is fix'd! I'll go and prayâbe not far off, my mother. (Exit Gemel.) Mar. What shall I do? these women have the power Of wreaking ill on us beyond belief; Either I must bribe well, and brave high heaven, Or take the cause of heaven and outbrave hell. In both there's danger!âWould that they were cross'd, Or to deserved punishment given up, Then might we live unscathed, and void of dread! My poor unhappy boy by some mishap Hath come within their power, and who can tell Where such wild fantasies and fears may end! SCENE VI. A Room. Isabel, Gelon. Isa. This is the very height of wild caprice; Come tell me where thou wert last night, my Gelon, And tell me truly? Gel. Never while I live! So ask me not againâit is a secret That ne'er must slake the ear of enquiry. Isa. Well, I shall find it out, and you had best Entrust it here, where it shall rest for ever. Gel. I earnestly entreat thee, ask no more. Isa. Saw'st thou Lord Hindlee? Gel. Ask him if I did. Isa. In all that thou and he have said of it, There is a mystery inscrutable, Which does astonish meâHe joys that you Are safe, and comes this day to take his leave; For he has, in a dream or vision, had Some strange unearthly message, that there is A dark fatality awaiting him, With which you are connected; and he goes For ever from your presence, to avoid The possibility of such event. Gel. He may avoid the sun, the light of heaven, The walks of nature, and the human face, But never that which is predestined. Yes, he may mine the solid earth, or fly Beyond the polar seasâbut that ordain'd Must come to passâI yield me to my fate, And so must heâtrust me, he cannot fly. O you shall see what power he hath to fly! Enter Hindlee. Isa. Welcome, my noble lordâall yet is well; Pray use your power to make this wayward elf Expose the doings of the bygone night. Hind. O beauteous Gelon, if thou knowest aught Of what befel, in pity of this heart, Of this bewilder'd mind and memory, Relate it all. Gel. When next you chuse, my lord, To assay your midnight rambles, be your mind Collected to the proof, for you may need To give account of it.âSooth, is it well That you should stray forth at the midnight hour, And then accost a maid in open day, And, with unblushing front, require of her To give account of you?âFor shame, my lord! It is not well! Hind. Perverse, like all thy sex! Resolve me thisâDid we two meet last night? Gel. How think'st thou of it? Hind. I think we did. Gel. In what place then? Hind. 'Tis that which puzzles me. No images but those of horror now Are shadow'd on my mindâIf it was not In hell we met, I wot not where it was. Gel. Dost thou say so?âThou makest my heart to ache! Oh, would to heaven that all we did last night Were now to do!âWe'll talk of it no more. Hind. This is most strange!âAnd must my mind still hang In burning anxiousness stretch'd on the rack? I loved thee, GelonâHeaven only knows How much I loved, but I have master'd it. I've had a message from the dead of thee; To prove it is a false oneâFrom this hour Far from this peaceful valley will I fly, And never see thee more.âI will not yield To fate without a struggle. Gel. Thy resolve Is a weak effortâfar thou wilt not fly: What must be, will beâCan'st thou countermand The whirlwind of the desart, or turn back The torrent when the storms of winter break? Then may'st thou fly from fate and me, my lord. Farewellâessay itâfar thou wilt not fly. Trust me, I know it. Hind. Dost thou brave me, Gelon? Nor you, nor fate shall do itâFare thee wellâ Be happy as I wish thee, and thou shalt Be happiest of thy race! (Exit Hindlee.) Isa. Can'st thou, my child, Give up nobility and worth, and thus Fling fortune to the wind?âGo call him back: Entreat him stayâsay some kind thing to him. Gel. Think'st thou I would?âHe'll come uncall'd for back; And that too ere expected. Isa. It is as thou hast said! hush! here he comes. Re-enter Hindlee. Gel. This time I'll prove my power over his heart, And let him see what strength he hath to fly. (She flings on the charmed ScarfâHindlee seeing her, starts in amazement.) Isa. How now? Why this amazement? Hind. O, I have seen that garb, that very look! Where I know not; but so combined and blent With circumstance of horror, that my blood Freezes at the remembrance!âI came back To say one single word which I forgot, But now I cannot goâMy heart and soul Are chain'd to thee by bond invisible. Alas! I feel, that or in earth or heaven Life without thee is misery!âO, my Gelon, Have pity on my heartâI give me up Unto thy guidanceâtake me to thyself For good or ill, for sorrow or for joy, And be my guide and ruling star through life. Gel. I know my fate, and, knowing it, I yield. My early stamp'd attachments I give up, And bow to that which is ordain'd to be: To wage a war with settled destiny Is impious and profaneâI bow to it. Hind. Dost thou then say thou wilt be mine, my Gelon? Gel. If thou so urgestâNow, or some time hence, I know it must be. Hind. At thy word I take thee; And this same hour shall make us one for life; And we'll be happy in despite of fate, Of visions, or of dreamsâO who with thee Could be unhappy!âHie we to old Lawrence, That primitive and heavenly-minded man, He shall unite us. Isa. O blissful day!âO fair and happy day! (Exeunt.) SCENE VII. The Witches' Cot. Grimald and NoraâTo them enter Maldie. Mal. Oh, Grimald, Nora, you have ruin'd me, By your forebodings of mishap and loss! I ween'd the things that I was doom'd to do The sooner done the better, and I run Headlong to ruinâShould you now refuse The aid which I am come to ask of you I am undone, an outcast on the earth! Oh my good name is lost, and all with that! Grim. Your name forsooth!âa trifleâa toy! I'll give thee succour, I'll give thee joy, I'll send it thee back by the hand of a boy. A maid is a bed of the linjet new, It brairds and bells in the morning dew; When first to the earth they press it down, O but it looks sad and woe-begone! It rises again with a timid air, And it looks more fresh, and it blooms more fair; And aye till the blue-bell o'er it flows, The more it is scathed the lovelier it blowsâ Just so is a maidâThy name's with me, I'll send it thee back by the youngest of three. Mal. But quickly, quickly it must be done, Else I am lost no more to won: My lover has left me in mighty fume, The priest expels me my comrade's gloom; Therefore to save this bursting breast, Bring back my lover and plague the priest. Oh take him off, for he's our bane, And keeps us all in fear and pain. Grim. 'Tis a high thoughtâdost thou concede? Mal. That do I, Grimald, it is my meed. Grim. Wilt thou renounce thy baptism? Mal. No. Grim. And prick thy arm till the red blood flow? And write thy name as I shall show? Mal. Oh! no, no, no! Grim. Then go, enjoy thy infamy; I work for no such chaff as thee! Mal. And must I see my lover no more, And the priest plague me as heretofore? Grim. Worseâworseâ He'll jug thee perforceâ A thing to laugh atâa thing to curse. Mal. Oh! woe is me! I am sunk full low! Where shall I turn?âWhat shall I do?â I'll do whatever you require, If you will grant my full desire: Bring back my lover and save my fame, Take off the priest by wind or flame, Or by the deed that wants the name. Grim. It shall be done.âWhen the fee is won, The hour-glass of the sage is run.â Sister, sister, how is the moon? Nora. She's in the wane and changes soon; If right I guess, to-morrow morn Up through the muir she'll thrust her horn, Before the midnight glass has run, Before the eyeless hour of one. Grim. That is the timeâthe hour of prime, The spirits will trip along the rime, So light we shall not hear their tread, Nor note the bend of the frosty blade, Their shadows shall flit along the green, Yet the forms that cast them not be seen; And thy lover shall weep in woes condign, And burn to join his fate with thine; And the ghostly dotard shall sleep and quake, And close the eye that no more shall wake. Note well the time and come to me, For all we do must over be Before the grey cock open his eeâ Ere the hill out of the heaven's breast, Draw down his cowl of fleecy mist, That shrowds within its folds of snow The laverock's home and the den of the roeâ Ere that our spells must all be done, The cause be lost or the victory won.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT FIFTH. SCENE I. A Room in a Country House. Enter Isabel. Isa. Oh! all the troubles I have had through life Are well requited, now that I have seen My Gelon raised to such high dignity! I never saw a morning sun so fair As this day's sun peep'd through the feathery hoar That floated on the air, in myriads borne, Like shreds of silver.âNever did the noon Of summer tide in all its richest hues, With blossoms braided, and with odours fraught, Kythe to my eyes so sweet as this short day, Spangled with mountain shade and wreathy rime. So exquisite my bliss, I have a dread That short will be its durance.âHer young lord I cannot throughly read, nor comprehend. A mystic madness tampers with his brain; But then his heart's so kind, I fain would hope 'Tis casualâan intemperance of the blood That soon may be o'ercome.âWelcome to me, My comely pair!âHow thrives the marriage state? Enter Lord Hindlee and Gelon. Hind. O, dame, I have no tongue to speak the half Of that delight that thrills around my heart From this uncensured and most joyful union. My feelings all are subtilized and new; I tread on a new world, and seem to move In new existence. Isa. Long may it hold.âO, I foresaw this change! My daughter, how say'st thou?âThere seems a look Of sadness mingled with thy bridal joy. Gel. I feel as one through darkness wandering, Because she needs must go, or following forth A dazzling meteor whither she knows not. I know it will notâcannot come to good. Hind. Down with forebodings! they have rack'd my soul, And so bewilder'd me, I scarcely know The right from wrong, the real from the false. Enter Ben. Ben. I give you joy, my lordâand youâand youâ Great joy unto you all! Gel. Is that a face Bespeaking joy? You rather seem to come On funeral errand. Ben. Pardon me, dame Gelonâ Lady I meant,âmy news are heavy news, Heavy to me, and should be so to you. A time so flagrant and atrocious I have not witnessedâMy only friendâ My dearest Gemelâ Gel. What?âWhat of Gemel? Ben. Isâisâhe isâ Gel. Thou weep'st.âWhat hast thou to unfold? Say what of Gemel? Ben. He is gone and left us. Gel. Gone! Whither gone? Ben. Gone to that place where he shall never more Have his kind heart broke by a selfish woman. False, faithless, perjured woman! he is dead. Omnes. Dead!âGemel dead? Ben. Yes, betwixt midnight hour and the cock-crow, This morn he breathed his last. Gel. Oh, there is nought in this unstable world But error and confusion!âOh, my head! Hind. Be comforted, my Gelon. Gel. Never, never! I fear that I have sinn'd against high Heaven, And yet not known it.âTell me how he died, His ailment, and his dying wordsâsay all, That my distemper'd mind may have one draught Of sorrow's bitterest cup. Ben. A strange mysterious sickness fell on him, Which did betoken death, for from that hour He boded it.âOfttimes he talk'd of you, For whom alone, he said, he wish'd to live, And all his wealth bequeath'd to you and yours. But when I told him you were wedded, that Gave the last stab into his bursting heart. He looked me in the face, and bade me not Thus trifle with his reason.âWhen he saw That I look'd sad, the truth burst on his mind, Like some o'erpowering flash; deeply he sobb'd, Turn'd his sad face away, and never more Did he address a word to human ear; But the last whisper hung upon his tongue, Breathed forth a prayer for thy forgiveness.â Gel. Oh! lost for ever!âmost unhappy bride! How grossly have I err'd!âHow grievously!â How could I deem it was the will of Heaven? Did Heaven e'er will a falsehood, or reveal The will divine to enemies avow'd? O, woe is me!âBut I'll do more for him, And his dear memory, than ever bride Did for her lord.âWho ever loved as I did? I ne'er loved man, and never will love man But only Gemel. Hind. Hold, Gelon, hold!âNo more! I have heard too much.âSay'st thou this to my face? Gel. I think not of thee, nor of aught on earth Save him that I have lost.âWoe to the time When first I saw thy face! Hind. Is it then so? That was a pang I wist not of!âBeware Of its renewal!âI possess a heart To kindness prone, but it has vehemencies For which I'm not accountable. Gel. Fool! Blindfold and ungracious that I was! Said'st thou he died uttering prayers for me? Ben. Yes, lady; I could hear him weep and sigh So deep, that every throb seem'd to uproot The tendrils of the heart. I heard him say, âThere is no truth on earth since Gelon's false! âMy Gelon perjured!âAll her holy vows âCast in the face of Heaven for sordid wealth! âForgive her, father, I implore of thee!â âMy Gelon!âO, my Gelon! is there aught âOn earth I can deem pure when thou art false!â Then did he turn his eye to the hour-glass That nearly had run out, utter'd a groan, And hiding in the coverlet his face, He yielded up his soulâthe kindest soul That ever animated mould of clay. Hind. (Aside, much agitated.) Perjured too!â Perjured for wealth!âOh, what a beast was I To buy a venal carcass!âPeace! peace here!â Gel. Praying for me!âHe died praying for me! (Clasps her Mother.) I'll clasp him to my bosom for't, and kiss His pale cold lips!âMy blood chills at my heart, And darkness settles round me.âOh! (Faints.) Isa. My child, my child! O help!âHelp me, my lord. Hind. Ah! what is this?âWhat can I do to help? Isa. Open these chests, and give me cordials forth Before the vital spark for ever fly. (Hindlee and Ben open one with a Key.) Hind. Here there is no such thing. Isa. 'Tis in the next,â Haste, break it openâbreak it all in piecesâ The cordials must be come at.âOh, my child! (They force open the next. Hindlee starts back and stands in fixed astonishment.) Ben. What is it that alarms you thus, my lord? Here are the vials; haste, apply them, dame. (They bathe Gelon's temples, &amp;c. who recovers, but speaks the first sentence wildly in delirium.) Gel. Touch me not, Grimald!â Avaunt, thou witch!âthou hag! thou lied'st to me! May all the spirits that attend thy call Tear thee in pieces!âProstituted wretch! Thy body his, thy heart can never be!â Curse on thee, rank impostor!â Pardon meâ I knew not what I saidâMake me my bed; And do it hastily, I pray thee, mother. Ben. My lord, you are not well. Why look you thus?âWhat saw you in the chest That troubles you? For if the pestilence Had issued thence in blue sulphureous smoke And seized your vitals, scarcely could your frame Have been perturbed so. Hind. I'll have it all! Yes, by the rood, I'll have the secret forth, If this should open up a vent for it. (Takes his Sword out of the Chest; Gelon starts and utters a cry.) Ha! it affrights thee, does it? List to me,â Here, as thy lord and lover, I entreat thee To tell me truly how thou camest by this. If thou refusest, by the Virgin's truthâ Isa. Swear not, my lord; she is in duty boundâ She must, and shall obey you. Gel. Your threats I value not, nor yours, nor aught That either can inflict.âBut as it isâ I'm sick of lifeâOh me, but this is strange! Now I remember the eventful words:â âNever, while life and breath remain, âThis sword and scarf must meet again; âThe hour thou givest this secret birth, âIt is thy last upon the earth.â Lies, like the rest!âIn this despairing mood I'll make experiment.âDost thou command? Hind. First, I entreat. Gel. 'Tis only on command I can obey, Then be the sequel thine. Hind. I do command then. Gel. 'Twas in the linn, in the wierd womens' cot, That I possess'd that sword.âI'll tell thee all: I went, though half in frolic, yet with mind Itching to pry into futurity. But ah! the horrid rites I witness'd there, And join'd in, were, I fear, most impious! When these were at the full, just when I ween'd Each moment that some beauteous fay would come In human shape, into the cot you rush'd In furious guise, and through an image there, That, in my likeness, and in this array, Stood roasting at the fire, you run this sword. Then uttering words of most unhallow'd breath, Forthwith you fled.âHere is the very gap Thy sword made in this scarf which now I wear. Hind. So 'tis to thee and hell I owe the pangs Of mind and body which I have endured? Oh, such a night as that I would not pass For bliss immortal!âCan I cherish then The fiend that can inflict it at her will! Thou impious wretch! so thou applied'st to hell To gain this most unnatural aggrandizement? But hell has cheated thee! Oh, tame would be The soul would stoop to bondage such as this! Throughout the very rent this sword once made Again I thrust itâthus it is decreed! Down with the sorceress! this for truth and heaven! ThereâGo to him thou trusted'st. (He stabs herâShe falls.) Isa. O, rash unhappy man! what hast thou done? My Gelon! Oh, my child!âAssist me God, For this is more than human heart can bear!â Thou maniac! O, thou most inhuman wretch, What wilt thou next?âFor pity's sake again Strike here, and lay me with my only child. (He heaves the weapon madly.) Ben. Hold, madman, hold! what dreadful mood is this? (Ben disarms himâhe makes no resistance, but stands in stupid apathy.) Isa. My hapless child! speak, is thy wound to death, Or may the hand of skill avail thee aught? Gelon. Few moments I shall liveâa very few. The tide of life recedes, and soon must mix With the dark billows of eternity. Give me one kiss, my mother, ere we part, And with it give thy blessingâWe may meet In other lands of calm beatitude. Bless me, my parent, and I'll hope that yet There may be grace for meâThough I have err'd, It was in judgmentânever from the heart. Isa. Bless thee, my child!âCould my weak vows and prayers Or life-blood win one boon of heaven for thee, They all are thine!âMay he who framed thy spirit, So soft, so gentle, that the summer breeze, Even in its morning eddies, never was More playful and more sweet, receive it back Into his bosom! (Gelon holds out her hand to Hindlee.) Monster, see'st thou this? Wilt thou not take that hand, and say farewell? Ben. Recal thy senses, sir; thou can'st not chuse But take the hand thy victim offers thee. Hind. How can I?âSee, thy frame is nought to it. I take a hand in this! (He looks unsteadily at his hand.) Ben. What, my lord? Hind. Note that same single finger, See how it rounds and swellsâthere is no bound To corporal magnitude.âA mast!âA pillar! (Staring at his Sword.) And thou art burning too, thou monstrous beam, Thou goad of red-hot steel; the very blood Is by thy fervency seared to a scurf.â Oh, minister of vengeance, art thou come! (Starts away.) (To Ben.) Peter, thou did'st not know that I was sentâ Sent!âSent!âYes, sent.âAnd over sea and land I go rejoicing, knowing I am sent. O what a glory to be sent abroad, A mighty minister, to do, do, do! And never to do wrong!âThough I take root And grow up to a mountain, there would be An energy remaining, still to do, To work, work onward; move, move, move! A living, an immortal agency! O, it is consonant to being's end! Ben. I comprehend not thisâTurn there thine eyes, And if thy soul is human, shed a tear O'er that mild formâOh, can'st thou brook that sight? Hind. Oft have I witnessed that dismal sight! It is not new to me!âfor years and days That scene has been familiar to mine eye! That wound, that garb, these faces, and these looks! Yea, this whole scene I've seen a thousand times. Now it is doneâWhat more!âOh! (Groans, and forces a hollow laughâafter a pause, he starts, and fixes his eyes on vacancy.) Ha! thou too there!âpoor hapless shade!âGoâgo Back to thy grave, the day-light will dissolve thee. See it is doneâWhat more hast thou to tell? If more, say onâPerhaps thou too art sentâ There's two of them!âThere's two of them! There's two! there's two! (Looks slowly at the Corpse and the imaginary Figures alternately.) Enter Father Lawrence. Isa. O, Father Lawrence, thou art sent by Heaven; We have much need of thee, for here hath been Most grievous workâmost foul, unnatural murder. Hind. Ah!âWho talks of murder? F. Law. What do I see! O hapless wretch!âhath man's great enemy Thus far got mastery of thee at the last, As guide thy hand to perpetrate this deed? Hind. Deed!âwhat?âwhat deed, good father? F. Law. Whose is this victim? Hast thou slain thy wife? Hind. Wife! wife!âslain my wife!â Must earth, and heaven, and hell, blab out that sentence? Still that, and nothing else? Why then 'tis well!âBut see'st thou these, good father? Speak to themâthey too are sent. F. Law. Whom dost thou mean? Hind. Dost thou not see these pale and rueful forms, How wistfully they fix their eyes on me? There's pity in their looks!âO, speak to them, And they will tell you the decrees of Heaven, Which I am sent to executeâsent!âsent! O, such a horoscope shall never more Mark out a finite track!âIt is the essence, The spirit of existence!âSpeak to themâ That pale and silvery cloud through which they look Makes them appear more fair! Go near to them, and speak, good father. F. Law. He is possess'd!âMad as the raving storm, Or chafed flood! Some demon is within. Isa. O, father, turn thee here! Thy utmost influence with heaven we need! Oh, would that memory and sense with me Were steep'd in dark forgetfulness!âMy child! My loved, my only child! was it for this That all my vows and prayers to heaven were breathed For twenty happy years?âWas it for this I nursed and rear'd thee with such anxious care? For this I loved thee, kiss'd thy ripening lips? And I must kiss them still, though now, alas! They meet not mine as they were wont! Yet to thy dust I'll cling, for it is all I love beneath the heaven! F. Law. Bear hence the body. We must go pray, for hell has been at work, And hell, I fear, has agents nigher us Than we divine. Let all the vale be warn'dâ This night we make our great appeal to God, And leave the event to him. (They bear in the BodyâFather Lawrence returns.) Come thou with me, Thou hapless, hopeless criminalâThy race Of happiness on earth too soon is run! Hind. Run, did'st thou say?âYes, I must run! It suits not God's commissioner to stand Till others come to chide him!âPeace be with thee, For I have far to go to-night!âThink'st thou That ever mortal was so highly blest, So honour'd, so distinguish'd, to be sent? Oh, how I'll bound like panther through the desert! The flood shall part before me and the flame; The sun of heaven shed coolness on my head; The stars direct, the green wave bear me upâ Post, post to the eternal goal!âWho calls? Here! here I am, the messenger of God! Have with thee, spirit of motion! F. Law. (Holding him.) Nay, stay with meâthou hast some work to do Ere you wend forth abroad. Keep guard on him. (To Hutchon.) Enter Martha, Isabel, and Ben. Mar. O, holy father, hast thou no controul O'er hell's insatiate emissaries here? If thou hast not, our country we must leave, For all is at their steps; and higher still Their rancour grows. I have lost my only son! Isa. And I my daughter! Ben. And I the maiden of my heart, whom they Have sore misled. F. Law. The fault is in yourselves; The power they have is depute of your folly. Ben. Say thou not so: I have heard voices speak, And seen the forms of men rise from the earth; Nay, my own self in every lineament. And from the wasteful robberies that have been For years and days, I buy their firm assurance; And though my flocks lie wide, my doors stand open, And all my chests unlock'd, I never yet Have lost the smallest itemâthink of that! I sin in telling it, for I was swornâ But none who pay to them are ever plunder'd. F. Law. But art thou sure of this? Ben. Most sure. F. Law. A new light breaks upon me!âI'll unmask This scene of guilt and infamy ere long. How many peasants have arrived for prayers? Ben. Ten goodly youths are here. F. Law. Let them be arm'd and watch around the cot; If they should hear this callâ(whistles)âone half of them Rush to our aid, the others guard the linn.â Shepherd, go thou with meâwe will salute them In friendly guise, as if to gain some knowledge Of these inscrutable maraudersâThis May throw some farther light on our mishaps. Ben. Urge them to show their powerâit is their pride; And be thou witness what they can effect. F. Law. I take thy counselâwe must deal with them In their own wayâcome thou and testify. SCENE II. The Witches' Cot. Grimald, Nora, Maldie. Grim. Here is the blood from thy right arm, Sign, seal, and rivet the charm. Mal. I would, but dare not, for I dread In doing so, I do a deed Not to be cancell'd or forgivenâ May I do this, and yet win heaven? Grim. Certes; think'st thou that we conspire With spirits damn'd from home of fire?â No, we consort with spirits free From every bond, as thou shalt be. Mal. First I desire that thou wilt show Thy power, what thou hast pledged to do. Grim. It shall be doneâname thy request. Whom would'st thou see? Mal. Call up the priest, Whom most I dread and most detestâ If he is thine thou hast the rest. Grim. Sister, bring my mighty book, And stir the black vat in the nook, For the scent is dead, and the scum is blue, And the vapour of an earthy hue; Although to us 'tis scarce a savour, It is a wall, it is a river, Would bar a spirit's march for ever. My words are struggling to have vent! My highest energies are bent On this last great experiment! (Aloud, waving her rod.) Commotion!âCommotion! In earth, air, and ocean! Begin!âBegin! Without and within! Gross-matter element, Fire and firmament, In discord and jingle, Commingle!âCommingle! Commingle!âCommingle! And thou!âAnd thou! To whom I bow, Hear me now! Hear me now! Now!âNow!â (A whistle without.) Nora. Hush!âStop the ritesâWhom have we hear? Haply 'tis my familiarâMove not limb, Nor tongue, nor finger, till I hearken him. (She opens the door and screams.) Enter Father Lawrence and Ben. Grim. Oh!âOh!âOh! (Howls in ecstacy.) We have won! We have won! He is ours! he is ours! The earth is our own. (Changes her voice from an eldritch howl to a deep hollow tone.) Spirit, we kneel to thee! Sign, set, and seal to thee! Laud to thy might, Thy honour and right, For the power is thine own By the day or the night. F. Law. Art thou distraught, dame Grimald? prithee rise, And let thy 'haviour similate to us, Conversant only with humanity. Grim. I have thee! I have thee! The world cannot save thee! Nayânothing alarm thee, Here nothing shall harm thee; But ah! should'st thou kick, Thy heart how I'll nick, And the arteries out of thy black bosom pick, Till the core in its cover My talons shall reach, And the drivelling soul grin out of the breach! Ha, ha, ha! ooh! (Howls.) F. Law. Cease, ceaseâI take the risk. Thou art aware That I deny your most redoubted power. I come to be resolved of it, and then I'll bow to you, and ask your aid and counsel As others doâCan'st thou, by voice, or sign, Or form of aught on earth or hell, advise Who or from whence these nightly robbers are Who harry us in every shape of man, Yet never can be found? Grim. Priestâanimal!â(for that's a name Suiting the brotherhood you claim,) Behind that hallan cast thine eye, And note if living thing you spy. (Father Lawrence and Ben, with lights, go behind the arras and return.) F. Law. No, nothingâNot a mouse is stirring here, Nor room I see for one to enter it. Nora. (Drawing a Circle round them.) Now stand you there. I would not aught befel you in this place: Swear therefore to me, not to move a foot, Nor once attempt to stir out of this circle, Whatever you hear or see, and you shall learn That you desire. F. Law. I doâI swear. Ben. And I. Nora. Sister, call. Grim. SpiritâSpiritâHitherward hie thee. Where shall I turn me?âwhere shall I spy thee? Come by the wind-hole like miasm swarth, Rise like a fire-fly up from the hearth, Or bore like a mould-warp out of the earth. Come not like shepherd, nor come thou like shade, Come not like elfin king, come not like maid, But come like a hypocrite stately and slow, Come like Priest Lawrence and tell what you know. Mouly, Gil-Mouly, sly mouse of the mill, Here-away, there-away, come when you will. (A soft cadence of Music within.) Oh! thou art come in music, art thou, spirit? Then thou art but a voice to-nightâa sound Without the semblancy of frame or being. Thou ever-changing modalist, can'st thou, In this earth-born unelemental state, Shape the thin air to words, or cadency, That nature may expound? Or sing, or say, Or mince in melody all that thou know'st Of the mysterious plunderers of the vale. SONG within. Beyond the mountain, beyond the moor, Beyond the border there is a bower, And in that bower there is a way That never oped to the light of day. There is a band, and there is a knight, Who sleep by day, and who wake by night; Beware the path by the forest tree;â Beware the fair maid that smiles on thee. F. Law. Grace be my shield, but this is wonderful! I have had proofs of secret conference, Of most mysterious kind, held with a maiden, Who shall be nameless here. Grim. Step forth, I say, thou freakish thing; Why fear a face so grovelling? Seest thou this priest of reverend fame?â Step forth in garb and form the same. See, I wave my magic wandâ Come, come, I thee command. Enter one habited like Father Lawrence. Spirit. Why am I called?âBeware of me! Of night and day count three times three, And that thou hast shall pass away. The word is given; note what I say. F. Law. Yes, I will note thee well.âAre we released? Nora. For one short moment stay, until we hear The sound that speaks his flight.â (Soft tones of Music within.) Now go thy way. F. Law. Suffer me once again to look within, That all my doubts may fade. Grim. Thou foolish wight! Search for a spirit, sooth!âSearch as thou wilt. (Scene changes to a dark Closet.âEnter Father Lawrence and Ben, with lights.â They search. As they are about to retire, Father Lawrence observes a line on the floor. He kneels down and examines it, tracing a square with his finger. He makes a sign to Ben, who likewise examines it. Father Lawrence blows the Call.âEnter five or six armed Peasants.) F. Law. One guard the doorâthe rest force entrance here.â Is the linn path belaid? Peas. Most closely guarded, sire. (They force up a trap-door, and descendâPause. âCries and firing without.âScene changes as before.âEnter Peasants, with two Robbers, guarded, one in the habit of Father Lawrence. âFather Lawrence and other re-enter from behind. F. Law. Now all the mystery is at once disclosed. Within this cavern are deposited The spoils of yearsâa motley countless spoil,â Robes of the dead and living without end; Coffins and cabinetsâO, what a scene Of guilt and imposition hath been here! In these two thieves I trace the remainder Of that cursed gang, that bold Egyptian race Late banish'd from our land, and dear the forfeiture To them shall prove.âHow camest thou leagued with them? Grim. I leagued with them!âNo! nor with aught That e'er with sense, or sordid flesh and blood Fester'd the face of nature.âI leagued with them! Poh! morbid wart! F. Law. Declare if this be true. Is she not leagued In your infernal policy and fraud? Nora. With us she is not leagued.âThese three long years That crazed unnatural thing hath been to us A source of wealth.âFull oft have these my sons Arisen from out that cave, in garb and guise By her called up, till she believed that all The spirits of the air and nether world Came at her bidding: Yet I needs must own, That human beings at her call have come; Some strange events by her have been forespoke; And, poor, deranged, and hagard as she is, She hath seen better days; for sore mishap Hath made of her a prey, therefore I deem Her sold to Satan, and her witching powers Unknown even to herselfâThis is the truth. Let us go free, and we these haunts beloved Will leave, and never more revisit them; But should you give us up to justice, I Have sons and true associates who will wreak Vengeance upon you, even to fire and blood. F. Law. That be our care to avertâLead them away To justiceâAnd for thee, wild hellish crone, Though duped, thou hast a most malignant heart, And hatred of all goodâThy curses now Return upon thyself, for thou shalt see A Cross of Leader such a sacrifice Of human nature in depravity, As Scotland hath not seen. Grim. Ay, lead me there, and prove your impotence To scathe one single hair of these grey locks. Cart me to hall of justiceâto the stakeâ Load me with fetters, chain this faded frame To rock of adamantâYour faggots pile High as the EldonâSqueeze the heaven and earth Together for a bellows to the flameâ O, I'll raise those from out the spider's nest, Or from the bluart's eye, will scatter you, And set the prisoner free!âI duped by you! Ha! ha! The arbitress of angels duped! Fardels of rank corruption!âOh, to move The overthrow of nature, the support Of such incarnate dross!âI'll call on it.â I'll order't to be done.âTremble, ye weeds! Ye garbage of existence!âfor your hour Draws on apaceâI saw it blazon'd red Upon the dial of heaven, and the hand, The pointer throwing hell's infernal shade, Near'd to its limb. F. Law. Cease thy wild blasphemyâLead her away. Why do you tremble? Take them to their doom, Which none so well have earn'd.âGod grant me strength, For there is need of comfort and rebuke. (To Maldie.) Thou wicked minx, what brought thee to this place? Cam'st thou again a conjuring for men? Ben. No names, so please you, sireâWeak, but not wicked. We have been all abusedâLook up, my girl, And do not weepâThere's something here thy friend; And if I can, I will forgive thee all. F. Law. Forgiveness is the doctrine which I teach, And peace and charity the themes I love. Enter Hutchon. Hut. O, sire, I come with more unwelcome tidings; Lord Hindlee is no more! F. Law. Father of Mercies, Do not destroy our trust!âThou messenger Of woe, say how it hap'd; for surely thou Art blameable in this? Hut. He 'scaped from me, And bounded like a wild deer to the waste, Crying aloud that he was sent afar On glorious mission. More than mortal speed Mark'd his careerâThe shepherd fled aside, The passenger to silent covert slid Till he pass'd byâLoudly he pray'd to Heaven, And then by turns he laugh'dâboasting amain Of that he would fulfilââI'll reach the bourn,â He cried, âI will! I will! and then I'll do it. O God! let me but on to do thy work, For I am burning for the high employ Of everlasting moment!âLaggard, on! On, Gabriel, on! thou messenger of doom! Fly! fly! Dost thou not see how I would fly, And then the wind would cool me? Oh, were I Dissolved into a wind, that I might sweep Light over hill, and plain, and yielding wave, Never to shift or change!âOr to a stream, For it is sent, and runs onâonâfor ever. I'll be a stream!âNo, no, I'll be the wind, And then there's no bar nor impediment On nature's face between me and the East. The wild-fowl of the heath will cower him down Till I pass overâswans will ope their ranksâ The solan swim asideâthe rolling clouds Fling wide their downy windows far before The eye of God's eternal messenger! I cannot! Oh, I cannot!âOn! On! On!â These were his words, while I his words could hear. His rout was traced with blood, for his bare feet Were lacerated by the shivering ice. That track I follow'd, forth, around, and back, For redder still it grewâAt length, hard by Beside the church-yard wall I found him stretch'd, A ghastly corse!âAh! such a woful sight Ne'er blench'd the human cheek! for in his hands Was squeez'd the snow-ball leaven'd with his blood. All clothing and encumbrance he had thrown, Yet kept the sacred book, which in the last Wild agonies of dying he had gnaw'd; And still within the grin of madness lock'd, The remnant of that holy book remains. F. Law. For mercy's sake, no more! Ben. Father, wilt thou not lay eternal curse Upon the authors of these miseries? F. Law. O no, I leave them to the just award Of Him, whose hand unerring sent this scourge By these his ministers, for grievous sin, Or others' welfare.âHence let never man Pry for a crevice to futurity, For all are wisely closed. O let it lie In its primeval darkness! Short the while That the dull twilight of this life can last, And then the dawning of Eternity Will pierce the veil, and all our longings end. END OF ALL-HALLOW-EVE.</field>
