      <field name="fulltext">TO The Right Honourable Richard Earl of Burlington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. Spoke by Mr. Delane. Well have the Greecian Bards adorn'd the Stage With royal Sorrows, and heroic Rage: Disdaining Earth, with elevated Eyes, One drew the angry Ruler of the Skys: Boldly he call'd from their divine Abodes Ambitious, restless, and the bleeding, Gods: Unheeded weep'd the injur'd lowly Maid, To Death, or Ruin, by her Love betray'd: Neglected sigh'd the fond despairing Swain, And the proud Nymph triumphant was in vain: The tragic Muse cast not her Eye so low, Or view'd regardless Scenes of humble Woe: Yet then Distress appear'd beneath the Shades, And Virtue mourn'd in unfrequented Glades. These Scenes the Woes of no exalted State Present, nor Satire to alarm the Great: Here Love and Friendship share an equal Part, To call soft Pity from the tender Heart: The pious Tear here filial Duty sheds, And weds a-while to Sorrow when she weds; Her virtuous Griefs, by Love supported, flow, And find Relief alone from Cupid's Bow.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE the Fields. Young Freeman and Charlotte Briar. Young Freeman. Why, Charlotte, hangs this Melancholly on thee? Why droops my Love? Why droops my ev'ry Flow'r Compris'd in one? Why on this happy Day, Indulgent to our Wish, wilt thou indulge Unseasonable Sorrow? 'Tis unkind: Why on this Day in which the pious Man Has join'd in Wedlock's Bands the Hands of two Whose Hearts by Love were long before united? Charlotte. Ah! Freeman, there's the Thorn that goads my Side. I must confess, since first our mutual Vows Were plighted, each Day seem'd to me an Age, Till I secur'd you mine; and now I have Obtain'd the Purchase of a thousand Sighs, I have a thousand Fears of losing you. Y. Freeman. And whence arise those Fears? From no Distrust, I hope, of one whose Honour's dearer to him Than is his Life, of one who places you In the same Ballance with his Life and Honour. Charlotte. No, my much lov'd, and ever honour'd, Husband, I cannot entertain a Thought of Ill Of you, yet when I think of my poor Father, My Fears arise like an unfriendly Frost, And seem to blight my Joys e'en in their Spring. Y. Freeman. Thou art the lovely'st Rose that ever blow'd. 'Tis true the Diff'rence which has long subsisted Betwixt our Fathers is the only Cause Why we have thus conceal'd our Passion from them, And why we keep our Marriage still unknown; But shou'd Dissention reign among our Parents, And everlasting Strife be sow'd betwixt them, Yet shall our Loves immaculate remain. Banish all dismal Apprehensions from you: Our Loves perhaps may take a happyer Turn, And be the Cement of perpetual Union Betwixt our present jarring Familys. I know my Father's ever gentle Nature Is prone to pardon Injurys, and to excuse The little Failings of unwary Youth: He looks not with the rigid Eye of Age, But ever makes such kind Allowances As by the wise and good are always made: In short, I know that 'tis his greatest Pleasure On all deserving Persons to bestow What Happyness he can. Charlotte. Wou'd I cou'd say The same of my unhappy Father! Then My Bosom wou'd be free from many Fears With which 'tis burden'd now: but he, poor Man, Has by his froward Temper loss'd his Friends, All, but his ever duteous Wife and Child; And our Endeavours are to cheer his Days With gentle Words and tender Offices: But, my dear Freeman, let me now intreat you To tell the Cause of the long Difference Betwixt our Parents; for I never cou'd Discover it at Home. Y. Freeman. 'Twas on a Trespass; For which we offer'd ample Recompence, Which being not receiv'd, a Suit of Law Commenc'd: your Father has already been At more Expence than he can bear with Ease: My Father has propos'd a Gentleman, A Neighbour and a Person of known Worth, To be the Arbitrator, and abide By his Determination rather than To feed Contention: and this is the Day That was appointed for the Arbitration. Charlotte. Heav'n make it fortunate; for upon that, I fear, our Fate, or mine at least, depends. Y. Freeman. Your Fate depends on me, and mine on you. Presume not, Charlotte, to affront my Love With a Distrust: 'tis of as pure a Sort As is the Zeal of Saints who know no Sin. My Father comes this Way: sweet Excellence, Retire beneath these Shades, while I enquire After the Arbitration, and th'Event, And while I try the gentlest, best, of Fathers With a Relation of my Passion for you: As he receives it, and I know he will, All corresponding with his Love to me, I will soon after chuse a fav'ring Hour In which I'll pour my tenderest Concerns, Our marriage Vows, into his friendly Ear. Charlotte. Success and everlasting Love be with you. [She retires. SCENE II. Freeman senr. enters. Freeman senr. I greet thee, Lewis, with a Father's Love; And, whether 'tis Design or Chance that throws Thee in my Way, I always count it Gain To have the near me, as thou'rt near my Heart, My Son, my best Companion, and my Friend. Y. Freeman. I owe you, Sir, more than is barely due To the respectful Title of a Father. Not once in five and twenty Years I've seen The Shadow of the Hand of Rigour o'er me. What I remember of my infant Days Were all with Pleasure and with Fondness crown'd: And while at College I pursued my Studys Pleasures flow'd on me in a thousand Streams From the rich Fountains of old Greece and Rome: And now the Virtues of the best of Fathers, The social Virtues, have bestow'd on me All that I wish'd to meet with in a Friend. Freeman senr. Thou art the Harvest of my Life's long Toil; And the rich Crop rewards my Labour well. Y. Freeman. Your Peace, Sir, is among my first Concerns, I therefore shall be glad if you'll inform me How the long Contest is at last determin'd. Freeman senr. To my Content, tho to my Cost: our Friend Weldon, who was appointed Arbitrator, Such is his Heart fraught with Benevolence, Franckly propos'd to pay Half Briar's Charge, Rather than see Contention kep'd alive Betwixt two Neighbours, who shou'd live as Friends. The generous Proposal was applauded; But 'twas my Choice to pay the whole myself, Hoping by that to gain a quiet Neighbour: The poor Man hates me for no other Cause But that I'm more successful than himself. Y. Freeman. Poor Charlotte, sweet and fair, thou faultless, Flow'r, How much unlike the Stock from which you sprung! Freeman Senr. What maiden was it that I hear'd you name In Terms so tender that I thought they spoke Her Sov'reign of your Wishes and your Heart? Y. Freeman. 'Twas Briar's Daughter, Sir. Freeman senr. Deal with me, Lewis, As you wou'd with a Friend to whom you'd sworn Inviolable Truth and Confidence; And you shall find that open Heart in me, And such an unreserv'd Regard, which you Might justly hope to meet with in a Friend Who had repos'd as dear a Trust in you. Tho I have weather'd thro near sixty Years, I've not forgot what the soft Passions are; And I mistake, if still I cannot read The Language of the Eyes; which is to me, Who have pass'd thro the various Scenes of Love, As legible as Characters in Gold. I perceiv'd plainly, when you nam'd the Maid, That Change of Countenance, and Change of Voice, Which tell me that your Bosom has receiv'd A Guest which you desire to entertain: If it is so, communicate to me; And shew not that Reserv'dness in yourself, Which you shall never find in me your Friend. Y. Freeman. No; be my Love my Curse, if e'er I wrong So good a Father, and so true a Friend. There are some Errors pass'd; but, by the Friendship Which you profess to me, I beg you wou'd not Enquire into them yet: what now I ask Is your Consent to prosecute my Love: That she is fair all who have Eyes can tell; She has such Virtues to adorn her Life, As in themselves will be an ample Dow'r. Freeman senr. I've often seen the Girl, and mark'd her well; And I acknowledge that I think your Passion, With all th'Extravagance of youthful Heat, Can not describe her lovelyer than she is: And, by the sacred Name of him that cloaths The Earth with Beauty, and the Stars with Light, Was she as poor as is the sunburn'd Wench That stoops to take the Gleanings of my Fields, I wou'd myself perform the Father's Office, And give her Hand to thee, so much, my Son, My own Felicity depends on thine. Y. Freeman. Then may that Son ne'er know the sweet Possession Of her whom his Soul loves, if ever he With his Consent shou'd give that Father Pain. Freeman senr. Yet, my dear Son, methinks there is a Bar,— Nay, do not start: it is not such a Bar As shall obstruct the End which you propose, But may a-while delay the sweet Possession. My Family is of a low Beginning: My Forefathers seem to have been no more Than lab'ring poor Inhabitants of Kent, The humble Tillers of another's Land; And all my Heritage was the long Lease Which has been oft' renew'd from Son to Son. When I was young, my Person was the Theme Of many a lovesic Maid and jealous Swain; Yet, while my Ears were fill'd with my own Praise, Nor Vanity, nor Pride, cou'd reach my Heart: I flourish'd then in Man's Opinion fair. Your Mother then was, like your Charlotte now, The Virgin's Envy, and the Wish of Men: Her Parents dy'd when she was young, and left her Ten thousand Pounds: I was her partial Choice Against the Approbation of her Friends: Her Father was a Gentleman: on that She has too often and too much presum'd. Now to the End to which my Tale has led: I doubt your Mother's Pride will make her start Objections to the Match; but it shall never Prevent it: what I mean is for her Peace To use some Art to draw her gently in To give Consent: I'm going Home, and there I'll try her with the Secret of your Love: Perhaps you're bound another Way. Farewel: My Blessing's ever with you. [Freeman senr. goes. SCENE III. Charlotte enters. Y. Freeman. Best of Men; Come forth, reveal thyself, thou happy Bride: Come from the Covert, I'll pursue my Chace; And thou, my lovely Game, shalt ev'ry Morn Wake with the waking Day to Happyness. My Father views thee with a Parent's Eye: Now let the Bus'ness of our Lives be Love. Charlotte. I hear'd him pass the joyful Sentence on me. My Task is now to come, to move my Father; Whose great Necessity perhaps may prove My greatest Blessing; for, so well I know him, If he was able to bestow on me A Portion equal to your own, he'd sooner Match me below, and far below, myself Than let me be the Wife of Freeman's Son. Y. Freeman. Come, my Charlotte, we'll go to him together, Together we'll present ourselves to him The fondest Pair that ever plighted Vows. I'll save my charming Bride from the Confusion Of telling the soft Story of her Passion: I'll be myself the Orator of Love, And tell our Tale in such a moving Strain, As, was his Heart wrap'd in Siberian Snow, Shou'd melt his frozen Breast: I'll paint a Prospect Of Happyness to us and to himself, And such a Prospect as should bribe him to us, Was he as savage as th'Hyrcanian Tyger. Throw into future Hours, my Love, thine Eyes, And see what Scenes of Bliss before us rise, Where Peace for ever dwells, nor enters Care, And Love the little God that governs there. The End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Briar's House. Briar and Charlotte. Briar. Yes, Charlotte, yes, my Child, to make you happy, I'll curb my Rage, I'll bridle up my Hate: The bitter Indignation, which I bear To Freeman, is not level'd at his Son: I will love him, my Girl, for loving you. Charlotte. O! may your Days be long, and prosp'rous all! He surely is the sweetest, gentlest, Youth, That ever trod the Plains, or woo'd a Maid. Briar. Daughter, I freely must confess to you, That I ne'er thought 'twas in the Pow'r of Words To throw my Temper into such a Mold, As the young Man has lately fram'd it to: His Language found a Passage to my Heart, And made me wish the Son of Freeman well. Charlotte. What do my Eyes behold? My Freeman's Mother! Come, I suppose, to bless me with her Voice: I shall grow mad with Joy. Briar. Does the proud Dame Once condescend to enter Briar's Roof! SCENE II. Mrs. Freeman enters. Briar. Madam, this unexpected Visit here— Mrs. Freeman. No slight Occasion wou'd have brought me here. My Husband has inform'd me that my Son Has, in the lavish Moments of his Love, Made to your Girl an Off'ring of his Heart. Briar. And you are come to make us sensible Of the great Honour which you now intend us. Mrs. Freeman. An Honour that's too great for you or her. Briar. Believe me, Madam, you are too presuming. Whate'er your Bus'ness is, tell it in Words As plain as is the Man to whom you speak. Charlotte. O! my poor Heart on what a Wreck thou'rt thrown! (To herself. Mrs. Freeman. Then plainly my Design is this, to tell you That your Thoughts soar above your low Condition. Whate'er my Son's misguided Love may be, Whate'er his Father's Resolution is, Your Daughter ne'er must wed a Son of mine. Look round about you, and you soon may find A Husband for the Girl that suits her Birth Among the lab'ring honest Hinds of Kent. Charlotte. Alas! whatever is my humble Lot, Eternal Blessings be on Freeman's Head! [She weeps. Briar. Waste not a Tear, my Child.—Woman be gone; Civility to thee wou'd be a Crime. Know that my Daughter, cloath'd by Nature's Hand With artless Beauty, and adorn'd with Truth And Modesty, wou'd grace thy Family With such a Picture of the female Sex As never yet it saw. Mrs. Freeman. I tell thee, Man— Briar. I tell thee, Woman, I will hear no more. Your own unmeaning Pride was the first Cause Of all my Hate to Freeman's Family, Which has encreas'd with Time, and now is fix'd, Fast as the Roots of Oaks, in Briar's Heart. As for my Child, she shall this Day be sent Where Freeman's Son shall ne'er behold her more. Away, my Ears are deaf to your Reply. [He thrusts her out. SCENE III. Charlotte. My Father, O! my ever honour'd Father, Let not your Resolution made in Anger Destroy the Peace, and break the tender Heart, Of your much lov'd, and ever loving, Daughter, In your Resentment to a haughty Woman. Briar. Did she not treat that Daughter with Disdain? I never will forgive th'insulting Dame: If you're desirous of a Father's Love, Banish young Freeman from your Breast forever. Charlotte. Impute not to my Freeman, my dear Freeman, A Fault that's not his own, no Part his own: I dare engage, for him and for his Father, That neither gave Consent to what she has done: Unknown to them, she rashly has pursued The Dictates of her Pride and settled Hate. Briar. Then from that Pride and settled Hate shall grow Plagues which shall taint her ev'ry Hour of Life. I'll send you to your Uncle: his Regard For you will equal mine: he has a Son, Who long has view'd you with a Lover's Eye, Whose Honesty and Industry will make you A joyful Mother and a happy Wife. Charlotte. O! name no Husband for your Child but Freeman: I have a Reason, Sir, which I cou'd give, That wou'd disarm you of your Rage, and change Your Resolution.—Look on me with Pity: I cannot leave my Love, nor wou'd offend My Father whom I love.—O! woeful Case! Here comes my Advocate; to whom I fly For Refuge; in whose Breast I must repose The Secret of our Marriage. SCENE IV. Mrs. Briar enters. Charlotte. Dearest Mother, O! help to break the Storm that's low'ring o'er me: My unkind Father, tho he means me well, Is tearing me from all that I hold dear On Earth, except himself and you, he threatens To rend me from my Freeman, from my Love. Mrs. Briar. With the Submission of an humble Wife, With Earnestness I now intreat my Husband To recollect the Vows he pay'd to me. Had I, when of our Daughter's Age, been torn From you, I shou'd not now, so well I know My Heart, have liv'd to intercede for her. Briar. Dost thou imagine that thou lov'st the Girl Better than I, or dost thou think thyself More wise and able to contrive her Good Than is thine Husband? Mrs. Briar. I am not so vain, (For humble as my Fortune is my Mind,) I'm not so vain, I say, to think myself So wise and able to contrive as you; Nor do I think my Love exceeds your own For our dear Child; but I believe I know The painful Workings of her tender Heart, By what I well remember to have felt Myself for you. Briar. Tho you do thwart my Will, I cannot hate you; for you've always been A good and an obedient Wife. Charlotte. Heaven give Her Words Success. [Aside. Briar. But if I once resolve, Your Words are spent in vain, idly they pass Like gentle Winds over the standing Corn, Ruffle the Ears, but leave no Trace behind. My Brother's Son shall make her soon a Bride: I'm going to prepare her for her Journey; Do you prepare the Girl to bear it well. [He goes. SCENE V. Mrs. Briar. I wou'd persuade you to your Ease, my Child: And, if there is a Way to shun the Match Which in his Rage your Father has propos'd, I will assist you with a Mother's Zeal, While I can act consistent with the Duty Of Parent and of Wife. Charlotte. Then I've some Hopes. Let us retire into your Chamber: there I will relate to you the Secret which I dread to tell my Father in his Anger: There I'll describe to you the lovely'st Youth, That ever fill'd a Virgin's Ear with Truth. [They go. SCENE VI. Freeman's House. Freeman senr. Mrs. Freeman, and young Freeman. Y. Freeman. 'Tis cruel, Madam, 'tis unmercyful, Thus to afflict, to torture thus, the Heart Of an obedient and a tender Son; But I'll complain no more of your Unkindness: Charlotte I come once more to try the Art Of soft Persuasion, which my Love inspires. [He goes. SCENE VII. Freeman senr. Ungenerous Dame, look backward to the Day In which I first engag'd my Love to you, And say if you can call to Mind a Moment In which I ever cross'd your Purposes. Your Beautys, whose Attraction once was great, Have suffer'd not but by the Hand of Time: Care never prey'd upon your rosy Cheeks; Nor have your Eyes e'er met an angry Brow From me till now: all your Inclinings I Have always with a lib'ral Heart indulg'd: Say, is it therefore kind, or honourable, Thus to proclaim an open War with me, To fight against my Will in an Affair On which depends our Son's Felicity? Mrs. Freeman. The Honour of my Family's concern'd: Why shou'd my Blood contaminate itself, By mixing with so low and vile a Race, If I am able to prevent the Evil? Freeman senr. That Pride, unsocial and unmeaning Pride, Shou'd thus survive the Mem'ry of your Love! Presume to talk of Family no more; That has been bandy'd in my Ear too long: Our Currents, which have thirty Years been join'd, Make but one Stream in him. Have you forgot That your Son's Case was once your own? If you Forget, I'll wake that Nature in your Breast Which you shou'd ne'er have suffer'd to have sleep'd. Mrs. Freeman. I never saw this Rage in him before. [To herself. I can receive Rebuke, or hear Advice, If you deliver it with a softer Voice. Freeman senr. You've been unus'd to my Rebuke, and deaf, Deaf as the Adder, to your Husband's Voice, When he advis'd you; therefore when the Peace, The Interest, of my Family's concern'd, I must not, as in slight Affairs I've done, Suffer your Pride and Humours to direct, Where Honour and where Wisdom shou'd preside. Mrs. Freeman. I see my Error, (nor too late I hope,) And earnestly repent my late Misdoings. Your former Lenity and Tenderness Convince me of your Goodness and your Love: If you'll forget, or if you can forgive, All my pass'd Conduct which has giv'n you Pain, My ev'ry Hour to come shall all be pass'd In humble Resignation to your Will, And in Submission, an unfeign'd Submission, To your superior Wisdom and your Pow'r. Freeman senr. Divested of your Pride, and cloath'd with Truth, And with the Saint's Attire Humility, You are as lovely to my Eyes as when I led you blushing to the bridal Bed. Wou'd Woman learn what is her lovely'st Dress, She wou'd not wish to make Admirers gaze At the rich Tissue, or the Di'mond's Blaze: In humble Beauty cloath'd, her best Attire, She'd either keep alive, or wake, Desire. [They go. SCENE VIII. Briar's House. Y. Freeman and Briar. Y. Freeman. Once more I tell you, Sir, with Truth assure you, That what my Mother did was all unknown To us. Briar. It may be so; yet shall my Child Ne'er be subjected to her hateful Pride, Who, in her peevish Moods, wou'd ev'ry Day Upbraid her with her Father's Lowlyness; And who wou'd let her know that all she wears Is but the Badge of Charity. Rather Than match my Girl to Wretchedness like that, I'd throw her on the barren Heath to dwell In a poor homely Hut, thatch'd by the Hands Of her laborious Husband, whose hard Toil Shou'd be their chief Support, while she at Home Plys, from the morning to the ev'ning Sun, The Spinning-Wheel, a constant household Drudge. Y. Freeman. My Mother now repents her Rashness, and Wishes to call your Child her own. Briar. Which she Shall never do: I thank her for her Visit; For she by that has shew'd me what a Fury My poor Child has escap'd. Y. Freeman. With the Respect Due to the Fountain of my Charlotte's Life— Briar. Your Eloquence, young Man, will now be vain: All you can say to me no more can move me Than can contending Winds remove a Mountain. Y. Freeman. Since my Intreatys fail, I must demand. Restore to me my Wife, my Virgin Wife, Whom yester Sun, with an unclouded Face, Beheld in Wedlock's Bands to Freeman join'd. Briar. O! this is well, you pillage first my Fold, And then with an undaunted Brow demand The Lamb that I've retaken from the Thief. The Negligence with which you've treated me, By daring to seduce my Child to Marriage, Without so much as asking my Consent, Shews me in what mean Light you place her Father: But know, unthinking Youth, this Disrespect Throws thee as far from my Regard as is The West from East; and I will part my Daughter, If I am able, I will part her from you, As far asunder as the North and South. Y. Freeman. You can as soon drive from the Stars their Brightness, As from my Charlotte's Thoughts expel her Freeman; Where-e'er she is, she will be always mine; You can as soon make Vice and Virtue one, As you can make my lov'd, my faithful, Bride Bestow her Heart or Hand on any other: She is my Wife, and, dow'rless as she is, More lov'd by me than by the Eye the Light, Or by the Ear than is the Charmer's Voice: I go, but I shall come to you again, And make you render up a true Account Of the great Treasure you withhold from me. [He goes. SCENE IX. Briar. Young Freeman and my Daughter have not yet Consummated their Loves; without Delay Charlotte shall therefore wed my Brother's Son. SCENE X. Mrs. Briar enters. Briar. What have you done? Have you prevail'd on her To bear her parting with a patient Mind? Mrs. Briar. So strong a Hold has Freeman on her Heart, That neither you nor I can tear him thence. Briar. 'Tis her first Love, and it must cost some Tears. Mrs. Briar. The Youth is lovely in his Person, and, By her Account, possess'd of ev'ry Art To captivate the Soul of Innocence: He has such Virtues, and such Qualitys; Which ever must, she says, secure the Heart Which he by Tenderness and Honour won. Briar. You seem to dwell upon his Praise with Pleasure.— You, I suppose, indulge the foolish Girl In her fond Commendations of her Lover.— Mrs. Briar. I have exerted all th'Authority Which, in a Case like this, a Mother ought; All the Persuasions which I think are just I've us'd, yet wou'd not use Authority With Cruelty, nor wou'd persuade my Child To that which may make all her future Life Unhappy, and perhaps that Life but short. Briar. The Journey is not long, I'll to my Brother's Go with the Girl myself, and see her marry'd Before I leave the Place. Mrs. Briar. If ever I Found Favour in your Eyes, if ever I Have merited your Love, hear me this once A tender Mother, and a faithful Wife. Briar. Be quick; I cannot hear long Speeches now. Mrs. Briar. This once, excuse my Tears, and I have done. If to your Brother's Son you wed our Child, You marry Poverty to Beggary, And make the Girl a Slave, a wretched Slave, Match'd to an abject Clown that she abhors: Think therefore, for I know you love her well, How you can bear to see her live a poor Unhappy Wife, a Stranger to Content! And if her Life's cut short, which Heaven forbid, By Grief, how will you then bedew her Cheeks With Tears, with frantic and with fruitless Tears! Now turn your Eye, from this dark dismal Prospect, To the fair Scene which Freeman's Love presents: The Husband of her Choice will crown her Days With Tenderness and Joy; and we, perhaps, May share their Fortunes as we share their Love. Distress, that seems approaching to our Door, May by this Match be drove entirely from us. I've done; I'll trouble you no more; and now The Language of my Heart has pass'd my Lips, I'm all Obedience to my Husband's Will. Briar. Thou tenderest Mother, and thou gentlest Wife, That ever bless'd a Husband and a Child, Lead in thy silken Bands this savage Man. Thou last subdu'd me to thy Wish. Stand there, And let me view the Treasure of my Soul, Above all Price, to which I never ow'd A restless Night, or an unpeaceful Day. Fortune may throw her keenest Arrows here, While you, the dear Physician of my Mind, Shall heal the Wounds and Bruises which they give. By that high Providence which gave thee to me, I wou'd not for all Freeman's Wealth, nor for The wide, the fruitful, and the rich, Possession Of ev'ry Hill, and Grove, and Vale, in Kent, Give up the Title that I have in thee. Come, my sweet Monitor, my humble Guide, Now you've subdued my Heart, direct my Hand; For I'll this very Moment write to Freeman, And offer your Proposals for the Marriage. [They go. SCENE XI. Freeman's House. Y. Freeman. Hark! is not that the Charmer's Voice afar, That crys, come Freeman, haste to rescue me, And snatch me from the Snares which now surround me! I come, O! Nymph divine, to seize my Right, Resolv'd to bear away my lovely Prize, Or perish in th'Attempt. [As he goes towards the Door, Charlotte enters. SCENE XII. Y. Freeman. Ah! is the Cloud, That hover'd o'er my Head, so soon dispers'd? It is, it is, and ev'ry Mist expel'd; And the gay Sun breaks brighter on my Eye. See the dear Angel of my Comfort comes! Say, heav'nly Fair, tell me, thou faithful Bride, By what assisting Pow'r you broke the Toils Which my Foes pitch'd for you, and shun'd their Hands, To find your constant and your tender Mate? Charlotte. I wanted, and I sought, no Pow'r but Love To guide me to my faithful Freeman's Arms. Your gentle Father, when I enter'd here, Gave me a Welcome, call'd me lovely Guest, And say'd, go in, and find one that will give You as much Comfort as you bring to him. Y. Freeman. You shall find Comfort and a Welcome here: I'll be the Castle of my Love's Defence. SCENE XIII. Freeman senr. enters with a Letter in his Hand. Freeman senr. Hail my lov'd Son, and my lov'd Daughter hail: The Storm which held ye from the wish'd-for Shore Is lay'd, and an unruffled Calm succeeds. Y. Freeman. Bless'd as I am, I'm sure my Father brings Some heav'nly Tidings to enhance my Joy. Charlotte. As from a Night pass'd in uneasy Dreams, I see the Dawning of a cheerful Morn. Freeman senr. Here, Lewis, take and read it to your Wife; And pour into her Ear a Balm that soon Will reach her tender Heart, and cure what Pains May still be lurking in it. Young Freeman reads the Letter. Sir, the Ills Of Fortune, and the reasonable Persuasions Of her whom I must call the best of Wives, Join'd with a warm Affection for my Daughter, Have brought me to a Sense of my Mistake, When I oppos'd a Match on which depends The Happyness of my dear Child. I don't Presume to make any Proposals to you: To you and your Family I commend her: With a free Heart I give the Girl; and I Shall yield myself contented to the Grave, Whene'er the Day shall come that calls me there, Being satisfy'd that I have made her happy By this last Act of mine. My heart is now Divested of all Enmity to you: May with your Years your Happyness encrease, Whate'er shall be the future Lot of Briar. Charlotte looks into the Letter. 'Tis my dear Father's Hand, and Blessings on him! Excuse my Tears; for they are Tears of Joy. Y. Freeman. O! my much lov'd, and much deserving, Charlotte, This Change, so unexpected, in your Father Commands my Admiration and my Love: I'm restless till I clasp him to my Breast, And let him know how much he shares my Heart. Freeman senr. I'll rise To-morrow with the Sun, and pay An early Visit to my Brother, and I'll greet him truly with a Brother's Love: I'll clear the Brow of Need; the Ills of Fortune, Which he complains of, I will soon remove: I will prevail on him, and on his Wife, That fair Example of connubial Love, To come and pass the joyful Day with us. The merry Bells shall wake the cheerful Morn, And call the Neighbours round to Freeman's Hall; There shall they feast, and quaff the plenteous Juice, Wishing the lovely Bride and Bridegroom Joy. My Wife and I will, with unsparing Hands, Attend our welcome Guests, and let no want Of nuptial Merryment disgrace the Day. Y. Freeman. Now, Charlotte, thou art mine, and I am thine, By ev'ry Ty of Duty and of Love. What to our Parents do we owe? Our Lives, And, what's more precious, that our Lives are bless'd. When o'er the spacious Globe my Eyes I throw, And view the various Sons of Pow'r below, The fertile Soils where mighty'st Monarchs reign, O'er eastern Beautys, and th'extended Plain, I wou'd not change, to be of all possess'd, The lovelyer Empire of my Charlotte's Breast. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE a Garden. Young Freeman and Charlotte. Y. Freeman. This Morning's Sun shines on the happyest Husband That ever yet possess'd a lovely Bride. Behold, my Love, the splendid Eye of Day Looks o'er the Hills in Brightness all array'd, While at our Feet the Flow'rs send up their Sweets, And ev'ry Tree, and Bush, is Melody, As if all Nature hail'd us to our Bliss. Charlotte. I'm surely bless'd beyond the Lot of Wives: I cou'd say much upon our happy State. Y. Freeman. Hide not a Blush, a Blush the Morning wears. Charlotte. I've not a Want, my dearest Freeman, now, But my poor Mother's and my Father's Smiles; Which I shall soon behold; for your good Father Went early out to seek the the wish'd-for Guests, And bring them hither. Y. Freeman. Swift ye Minutes run, And bring to my Embrace that honour'd Pair, To whom I owe the Spring of all my Joys! In this dear Bosom of unrival'd Sweets Is all the Treasure of my Soul repos'd. SCENE II. Weldon enters. Weldon. There stands a Friend, so much he shares my Heart, Whose Peace I value equal to my own; Yet must his Ears receive a Tale from me Which to his early, his ecstatic, Joys Will prove like Blightings to the budding Flow'rs: But 'tis a Tale that, if I shou'd not tell it, He soon must hear from a less friendly Voice. [To himself. Joy to my Freeman and his charming Bride; And much I wish that I cou'd give you both, As you deserve, more Comfort than I bring. Y. Freeman. Welcome the dear Companion of my Youth, My much lov'd Weldon: thou art come to share, And to encrease, the Pleasures of the Day: But, my dear faithful Friend, methinks you wear A Sadness in your Countenance, that suits The present Hour but ill. Weldon. I've at my Heart A Burden which I must unload to you, And that to you alone; and, tho the Season Seems but ill chosen for a Task like this, It must not be delay'd. Y. Freeman. Go in, my Love: Thou Beauty who art always in my Eye! Charlotte. Whate'er my Beauty is, my only Pride Is plac'd in my Obedience and my Love. [She goes. SCENE III. Weldon. Freeman, we've long been Friends; and, when at College, We've often turn'd, with an enquiring Eye, Together o'er the philosophic Page; Thence have we learn'd that true Philosophy Consists in bearing Ills inevitable With the same Patience as we'd view a Storm, Which is not in our Pow'r to stop or lay. Y. Freeman. So well I know my Friend that I am sure He wou'd not bring a Trifle to my Ear Prepar'd with such Solemnity as this. Speak what you have to say; I am resign'd. Weldon. I'm glad you are; for you have much to bear. Y. Freeman. What can affect my Peace? My Charlotte's well, And she is mine, and worthy my first Care: But hold, I now begin to doubt my Pow'r. If the sad Story which you have to tell Is of the Sorrows which you bear yourself, I shall break in upon the Joys which I Propos'd to-day, and mix my Griefs with thine. Weldon. Your Tenderness for me makes me already Anticipate the Anguish to myself, Which you too soon must feel: howe'er, resolve To bear it like a Man. Be sure I will Not leave the Friend I love, my second self, In the Distress with which I shall o'erwhelm you, For I will keep a friendly stretch'd-out Hand, Till I have pull'd you out, or sunk with you. Stand firm; be ready for the Stroke. Y. Freeman. I am. You see a sturdy Oak that well will bear The Buffeting of the contending Winds. Weldon. Stand firm I say again. Within this Hour I saw your Father seiz'd, and haul'd to Jail. Y. Freeman. At that I'm more surpris'd than terrify'd: The Action must be forg'd, he's not in Debt. Weldon. This is but as a Breeze that only moves The Leaves, and has not Force to shake them off: This you bear well; and, as the Winds arise, Keep steady as the Oak, and fortify Your Mind with Resolution; for the Charge Against your Father is no less than Murder. Y. Freeman. He never cou'd delight in Blood, but rather Wou'd spill his own to save another's: yet Go on, and tell me who's the murder'd Person. Weldon. Give me your Hand; and stand against this Blast, And you may bear the Rest.—Your Charlotte's Father Is dead. Y. Freeman. Murder'd by whom? Not by my Father; For since your Arbitration of the Diff'rence Betwixt them, they were Friends, without Reserve, And by the strictest Bonds which cou'd be bound: There's in our Familys so great a Change, That all our Hearts are one. I have some Hopes That the Report of Briar's Death is false. Weldon. I saw him breathless, and besmear'd with Blood, And saw your Father, after he was seiz'd, And hear'd the Charge, the fatal Charge, against him, With ev'ry Circumstance attending it. Y. Freeman. I'll lay my Hand upon your friendly Arm, While you relate me each particular Of this mysterious melancholly Tale. Weldon. Briar, unhappy to his End, was found, In his own Fields, dead and besmear'd with Blood, And in his Side a Wound; your Father by him, And in his Hand the Staff that gave the Blow, The iron Spike at the sharp End of which Was cover'd o'er with Blood, and, as they try'd, Exactly fill'd the Wound: thus stands the Case. Y. Freeman. This is like Thunder from the Hand of Heav'n; And I must yield to it. Weldon. Bear up, my Friend; Droop not beneath the Storm that beats upon you. I will use ev'ry honest Art to heal Your Wounds, and to emerge you from Distress. I'm going now, confide, dear Freeman, in me, Upon a Work that to the World will shew My Sense of Honour, Justice, and of Truth. [He goes. SCENE IV. Mrs. Freeman enters. Mrs. Freeman. Was ever pleasant Morn o'ercast like this! O! my lov'd Son, for much expected Joy, Array yourself with Sadness and Despair. I have receiv'd such fatal Tidings as I dread to tell. Y. Freeman. They have already reach'd My Ear, and deeply enter'd in my Heart. Madam, retire, and leave to me to guide The shipwreck'd Bark thro such a Storm as this. What Comfort I can bring my honour'd Mother She may be sure I'll give. Mrs. Freeman. Talk not to me Of Comfort; I'll have none; for none do I Deserve. O! cou'd I but recall the Hour In which my Pride drove me to Briar's House, Contented I'd meet Death in any Form! Y. Freeman. My dearest Mother, add no recent Griefs To those which now are scarcely to be borne. O! my poor Charlotte, what hast thou to feel! Mrs. Freeman. The Torrent has o'erwhelm'd that lovely Flow'r; Which I committed to the Care of those Who will not be unmindful of their Charge. Y. Freeman. That Charge be only mine. SCENE V. As he is going Charlotte enters. Charlotte. Where's Freeman? Where's My Husband? Are you here? Give me my Father.— Is this the Joy, is this the Paradise, The nuptial Boon which, with a thousand Sighs, And glowing Kisses, you promis'd me?—What? Sent you your Father forth to murder mine? Know that the Wound of which my Father dy'd Has kill'd your Wife, has kill'd your loving Wife. Y. Freeman. O! think that ev'ry Tear my Charlotte sheds, Draws from her Freeman's Heart the sanguin Drops. Charlotte. O! O! [She leans on him, and sighs. Y. Freeman. Yield not, my Love, yield not, my Life, So much to Grief; for ev'ry Sigh you fetch Flys to my Breast, and does the Dagger's Office. Soul of my Soul look up, and see, in me, A Father, Husband, Lover, and a Friend. Mrs. Freeman O! Sight of Woe! too much for me to bear! I must withdraw myself, or sink beneath The Weight of Sorrow which their Griefs bring on me. Hide me ye Hills, and cover me from Day; Nor ever let me taste of Comfort more, Till my lov'd Children, and my much lov'd Husband, Are free from Danger, and to Joy restor'd. [She goes. SCENE VI. Charlotte. My Father! O! my Father! Wretched Wife! Y. Freeman. Your Father's Death is yet a Mystery, A Myst'ry which To-morrow may unveil. Charlotte. To-morrow will not give me back my Father: Methinks I hear him cry, Charlotte, my Child, Fill not the Arms of him whose barb'rous Sire Imbrued his Hands in the same Blood of which You was a Part: and must you be obey'd? That too is hard: my Love is innocent, My Freeman is not guilty: O! my Heart! Y. Freeman. Here sit, my Love, here let my Charlotte rest; And I'll be near you, near my Soul's Support, He comes forwards. Lest in the dreadful Absence of her Reason, She shou'd commit some Violence upon The lovely'st Frame that Beauty e'er was cast in. He goes towards her. If there are Ministers of Heav'n to guard The innocent, and Virtue is their Care, Here let them take a Charge that's worthy them, And from her fair unblemish'd Seat of Thought Drive ev'ry Image of Affliction; there Let no Appearances Admittance gain But what are fraught with Joy: to her Mind's Eye Shew the fair Prospect of our future Loves; And let no Traces of her former Griefs Be lurking there; but let her rise to Bliss. SCENE VII. A Servant enters. Servant. With Sorrow I approach my much lov'd Master, When I must bring Addition to his Woes. The virtuous Matron's dead; the Weight of Grief, Pressing too fast upon her gentle Nature, Has stop'd her Springs of Life; and she's no more. Y. Freeman. Who is no more? Servant. Your Charlotte's Mother's dead. [Charlotte faints. Y. Freeman She sinks, she faints; and if the Angel's fled To her original Seat of Bliss, to Heav'n, I've Nothing more to manage here on Earth. [Turning to the Servant. This is a Tale you shou'd have told to me, To me alone, that at a proper Season, More fit than this, it might have reach'd her Ear. O! Charlotte! O! my Wife! hear, hear, the Voice Of him that calls you back to Life, to Love.— Her Breast is cold, her Eyes have loss'd their Lustre; But her Breath's sweeter than the Syrian Rose. O! charm me with the Music of thy Voice!— She breathes; and on her Lips Carnations bloom; And her Eyes cheer me like the Morning Sun. Charlotte. Who calls me back to Life, to Wretchedness? Y. Freeman. To Life, my Soul, and Love, to Love, and me; For, after such a black and dismal Storm, The Face of Heav'n must soon begin to clear. Charlotte. Mine is no common Case, no vulgar Misery: A loving Father and the tenderest Mother That ever a poor Child was bless'd with, gone, Gone, and for ever loss'd to wretched me. Who, not divested of Humanity, Can see my Woes with an unpitying Eye? And what Daughter (I am no Daughter now!) What Child, what Orphan Child, that has a Sense Of Duty and of Love, can think of Joy, Or can, in my Condition, think of Life? Come, Death, to one that earnestly invokes you, O! come thou friendly everlasting Sleep, And close my Eyes in Night that knows no Dawn. Y. Freeman. Perish a thousand Worlds rather than you, Than you, to me a World of Sweets, shou'd give Those scarcely tasted Beautys to the Grave! 'Tis Virtue now to live, and great the Virtue, To save that Life which all depends on thine. Charlotte. If I can live, I need not strive to love.— O! Freeman, take me to your honest Heart; And, if I keep the full Possession there, Life will be worth my Care, preserv'd by you. Tho strong the Pains which have besieg'd me round, Your Love must be the Cure of all my Grief. Y. Freeman. Thou sweetly drooping Flow'r, come to this Breast, Which has no Room for any Guest but you. I have no Thoughts of Paradise beyond What my dear Charlotte, what my Love, can give: I have no Wish, but what I wish for you: Wish I to live, 'tis that my Life may be Employ'd in tender Offices to you: Wou'd I behold Encrease of Flocks and Herds, 'Tis that I wou'd encrease my Love's fair Dow'r: Have I delight to see my Garden yield The fairest Flow'rs which e'er adorn'd the Spring, 'Tis that they may adorn a fairer Flow'r: If, when I walk my Orchard round, I hope To see my Fruit-trees bending with their Weight, 'Tis that I may prepare a grateful Feast, And to the cheerful Banquet call my Love: Whate'er I wish to have, or wish to be, 'Tis to improve thy Bliss, and merit thee. [They go. SCENE VIII. The Court sitting, the Judge, the Jury, Witnesses, Freeman senr. at the Bar, and Weldon Foreman of the Jury. Judge. Hear and consider well the Charge against him. Seven Witnesses of Reputation here Swear that they found him striding o'er the dead, And in his Hand a Staff, whose bloody Point Exactly fill'd the Wound, fresh bleeding then: From what we've hear'd we must our Judgement pass; In mine he's guilty; but the Sentence rests In you the Arbitrators of his Life: You, who are foremost of the Jury, speak. Weldon. He's innocent. Judge. Is that the Voice of all? Weldon. I speak, my Lord, th'unbyass'd Voice of all. Judge. Now, by the sacred Majesty of Heav'n, That sees and judges all, the Blood of him, Our fellow Subject, who was foully murder'd, Crys loud for Justice; Blood for Blood repay: In him the King, his Wife, and only Child, Have loss'd a Subject, Husband, and a Father: The King, his Wife, and Child, of you demand That Justice shou'd be executed here. Weldon. Give me your Promise that his Life's secure, And I'll produce in Court the Man that kill'd him; Nor do I ask that Promise but on Terms Which you may grant with Honour to your Name. If it appears that he who kill'd him did it Neither in Wrath, nor with his Will's Consent, But in his own Defence, your Promise stands. Judge. I freely give it; and be Heaven's high Judge The Witness of my Heart. Weldon. I am the Man. Judge. Bold and intrepid.—Quick proceed to ease Th'astonish'd Court, that's full of Expectation. Quick and proceed I say. Weldon. Behold in me The Man that kill'd him, but no Murderer. Judge. Now to the Fact. Weldon. Tho much my Mind is shock'd At the Remembrance of the fatal Deed, And gladly wou'd avoid th'unpleasing Tale, Yet, in Regard to Truth and my fair Name, I will begin.—Early in the Morning, as My Custom was, I walk'd o'er Briar's Grounds, And met him unexpected in my Way: I took Occasion then to talk to him Of an Account that had been long betwixt us: As our Dispute grew high, I thought he us'd A Language too ingrateful to the Man Who had been a patient Creditor so long: He did indeed provoke me, by his Usage, For rude he was, to treat him with more Warmth Than ever yet I treated any Man, And to reproach him with Severity: Th'unhappy Man, impatient of Rebuke, Struck on my Temples with an oaken Staff: Amidst my Rage the Stick I wrested from him, And, smarting with the Blow, drove at his Side; When suddenly he fell, and with a Groan Cry'd, I've deserv'd my Death, and spoke no more: Astonish'd at the Blood which flow'd from him, I view'd the Staff; at the small End of which Was a sharp iron Spike, which had before Escap'd my Eye.
