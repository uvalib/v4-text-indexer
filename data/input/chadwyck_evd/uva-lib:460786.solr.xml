      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Presence Chamber of Wunsuponatyme, King of Neverminditsnamia—The King discovered on his throne, surrounded by his Court, and attended by Count Coincide and Officers of State—Flourish. King. Stand all apart!—Cousin of What's-your name, Give me your hand, and help me play my game! Courtiers stand aside, and King descends from throne, leaning on the arm of his Minister. You are the wisest man in our dominion; For you are always of our own opinion; Therefore we've great respect for your advice, And we will follow it at any price— Whilst it accords with our good will and pleasure. Min. Your Majesty is gracious beyond measure! King. My Lord, you know whate'er I say is true. Min. Undoubtedly;—and right whate'er you do. King. Brave man!—who all he thinks thus boldly says! Min. Great king!—whom, without danger, we may praise! King. You'll scarce believe what you're about to hear! Listen—I'm getting older every year! Min. Had any one except yourself said so, I should have doubted!—but you, sir, must know. King. 'Tis passing strange!—but fact!—I'm nearly eighty! And sigh for “otium sine dignitate.” My eyes grow dim!—my limbs are not so strong! And Tom Hood says, when folks have reigned so long, 'Tis time they mizzled! Min. Tom Hood did but joke. King. But oft, in jest, one gets an ugly poke! So, tongues to stop, and civil war to muzzle, We'd make our heir apparent;—there's the puzzle. My queen (who was the best soul upon earth) Brought me, you know, three fine boys at a birth. Born on the self-same day, of the same mother; I know not that one's older than another. So of my crown I'm forced to keep possession, Because I cannot settle the succession. Min. 'Tis a hard case—a crown, perforce, to wear! Amongst the three, suppose the realm you share? King. What, cut my kingdom into chops, as though It were a loin of mutton! Butcher!—No! Min. Let them draw lots for it. King. That's gambling! Never! We have abolished lotteries for ever. All danger from the frowns of Fortune spurning, We, for the general weal, stopt hers from turning. Min. Why not decide yourself?—Have you no choice? King. No; Nature cries with a most equal voice:— So brave! so good! so handsome all the three! One just as soon as t'other, king I'd see! D'ye take? (shews a purse, and punches him in the ribs.) Min. Who wouldn't? (taking purse) Sir, you've touched me nearly; I now begin to see the matter clearly; Suppose your Majesty should name some deed In art or arms; and he who should succeed In that—which might not be an easy thing— Might then succeed your Majesty as king. King. An excellent suggestion! and a new. Min. Something—almost impossible to do. King. I have it; a good thought! My pages, ho! Summon the Princes to my presence—go! (Exeunt Pages) I need not tell a wise man in your station Nought is so difficult as resignation. Song—King—“When a man marries.” Though a man's worried Half out of his mind, To leave a good place He is seldom inclined. And cobbler or king. As he happens to be, There's no one he'd like Better in it to see. Monarch great— Head of the State! Treason to ask if he should, sir! Minister—Prime— Never has time. Couldn't resign if he would, sir! Lord Mayor, When once in his chair, Doesn't like “turn about,” sir. Commissioner Lin, Or any one “in,” Had rather be worried than “out,” sir. Toiling, moiling, wearing, tearing, rumbling, grumbling, blustering, flustering. Though a man's worried Half out of his mind, To leave a good place, He is seldom inclin'd! He's seldom inclin'd. He's seldom or never inclin'd. First Page. (enters and announces) “Prince Precious.” Enter Prince Precious. King. Come, boy, to thy father's arms; A sceptre has for thee, I'm sure, no charms. Pre. My royal father, pray how should I know, Unless I had it for an hour or so. King. It needs a grasp of iron;—an eye as quick as lightning. Pre. So, papa, does single stick; And I'd crack any body's crown at that. King. (aside) He'd crack his father's—the audacious brat! Second Page. (enters and announces) “Prince Placid!” Enter Prince Placid. King. Come, boy, to thy father's breast!— Thou wouldst not that a crown thy forehead prest? Pla. It's quite impossible, my liege, to say, Unless I wore it for at least a day. King. “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.” Pla. But can't you take it off when you lie down? King. (aside) Beneath that simple air much guile may lurk; If I let him succeed me—I'm a Turk! Third Page. (enters and announces) “Prince Paragon.” Enter Prince Paragon. King. Here's one, at least, will own He has no wish to sit on yonder throne! Par. None in the least, my liege. King. Wise boy! (aside) I vow I've half a mind to fix upon him now. Par. I'll sit on anything and anywhere; So that I'm but a king—that's all I care. King. (aside) Humph! second thoughts are best; 'twould be unjust Above his brothers this wild boy to thrust. (ascends his throne) Attend, whilst we our royal will make known. Princes and peers, like Wolsey I am grown An old man, weary of the cares of state; And have made up my mind to abdicate. To a small country house I would retire; And, for companionship, I much desire A pretty little dog. Now, of you three, He who shall bring the prettiest dog to me By this day twelvemonth, shall become my heir, And Neverminditsnamia's sceptre bear! But mark! we stipulate the dog you bring Must be so small 'twill pass through this thumb ring! About it straight—you have no time to lose If your souls burn to stand within our shoes! Air—King. Come bustle, boys, about, There are dogs enough, no doubt; In each court are spaniels plenty, In each street are puppies twenty; But if here you wish to reign, You a lap-dog must obtain, Which in a thumb ring you could wear O! Singing hey down, O down, derry, derry down, And that's quite another affair O! Chorus. Singing hey down, &amp;c. (Exeunt in procession, King, and all but the Three Princes) Par. Brothers, to use an epithet emphatical, I think papa's become much too dogmatical. Pre. I say, this order will, to all our losses, Prove one composed of nothing but grand crosses. Pla. A lap dog you can pass through a thumb ring! I, like Macbeth, exclaim,“There's no such thing!” But for the Isle of Dogs I'll start to-day! Pre. And I'll to Houndsditch with what speed I may! (Exeunt Princes Precious and Placid) Par. I really don't think I shall take the trouble To stir a step—this business is a bubble! Our dad is only of us making merry. A man might hunt from Perth to Pondicherry In vain for such a dog, I'm certain—very! Air—Prince Paragon—“Oh, ruddier than the cherry.” From Perth to Pondicherry, From Bow to Bedfordbury, No dog so small Exists at all, Of that I'm certain—very! Our dad, who's no Dogberry, Is only making merry, And holds up thus, His crown, for us To bob at like a cherry! You might now, in a wherry, From here to Chelsea ferry, And not turn up So small a pup, I'll bet a pint of sherry! From Cork to Londonderry, From Donegal to Kerry, None such one sees, Though out on sprees All night like Tom and Jerry! Where's Jingo! Though a mad wag in his lingo, He's staunch and true; I always swear, by Jingo! And I have known, in matters much more nice, A man to profit by a fool's advice! Jingo! Enter Jingo. Jin. Obedient to your Highness' call, Behold me ready-booted, spurred and all. Par. Booted and spurred, Sir Fool! Why, whither wend you? Jin. Upon the errand that the King would send you. Par. Why, 'gad a mercy, knave! 'tis none of thine! Jin. 'Tis a fool's errand, so it must be mine! Par. Wilt do it? Jin. Not alone; but if you plan A journey, master, I'm your journey-man. Par. Give up a place at court to go with me, Who've nought to give? Jin. 'Tis a fool's trick, you see. Par. Travel o'er land and wave, through woods and bogs? Jin. We shan't be long, sir, going to the dogs. I'm glad your father didn't want a cat; I never could have gone in search of that! I have a horror of the race feline— I dread a cat, whose lives or tails are nine; Though other dangers I but little heed, I'm very pussy-lanimous indeed! Par. Well, for a frolic, then, suppose we start Upon the instant. Jin. Sir, with all my heart. The scene changes suddenly to a Forest. Par. Hah! the ground opens, and a chasm vast Before us yawns! the earthquake's come at last! Jin. Is this a dream?—if so, make haste and wake us. You said, “Let's start;” and here's enough to make us! Par. Methought but now we in the palace stood, But now the ground we stand on's in a wood. Some treason this! Jin. Why, sir, it stands to reason It couldn't be a wood without some trees on. Par. O cruel Fate! Jin. Nay, sir, don't be down-hearted; We arrived safe the moment that we started. Par. Arrived! but where— Jin. Ah! that I won't pretend To say; but doubtless at our journey's end. And as you didn't settle where you'd go, It cannot make much difference, you know. A Finger-post appears. Par. See, there's a finger-post! Jin. (reading) Well, I declare! We're fifteen thousand miles from everywhere! Par. How! fifteen thousand miles in half a minute? Jin. Oh, now-a-days, sir, there's no wonder in it!— The world is changed most sadly; in our past days We had some feasts; but now they are all fast days: The stream of time has now become a rapid, All but velocity is voted vapid; Another Quick upon the stage they need, The only chronicler will soon be Speed; Quick was George III.'s favourite comedian; the original Tony Lumpkin and Acres. John Speed the historian (1555–1629), who amongst other works compiled a History of Great Britain. And really so like lightning goes our cash, I fear Bank Notes will soon give way to Flash. The trees open, and discover the Gates of a Fairy Palace. Par. Sure, that's a building—somebody's abode! Jin. The terminus, no doubt, of this branch road. Par. The doors are massive gold—or look as well! And here, in jewels, “Please to ring the bell.” Jin. A deer's foot hanging by a diamond chain! Some folks to wring it off would not disdain. Par. At all events, no further will I roam, But ring and see if any one's at home. Rings the bell; the gate opens, and twelve hands appear, bearing torches. Nothing but hands; the sight exceeding odd is! Jin. It proves, at least, the mansion is nobody's! Par. A dozen of them, and all holding candles. Music—“Harmonious Blacksmith.” What music's that? Jin. No doubt it's some of Handel's! Chorus —“Voices of Invisible Spirits.” Ding, dong, bell— Pussy's in the well; Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, bell! Enter here Without fear— You may break the hateful spell; Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong! Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, bell! Jin. Oh! Pussy's in the well; I'm glad of that; I'll walk in boldly as they've drown'd the cat. Par. Say, shall we enter this enchanted hall? I have a sword, and they've no arms at all. Jin. Enter at once, nor stay here words to bandy; This house must sure belong to “Handy Andy”! They enter—Scene changes to the Banquet Hall in a Fairy Palace, brilliantly illuminated; in one part an Orchestra— The walls are painted with subjects from all the Stories about Cats, such as “Puss in Boots,” &amp;c. Enter Prince Paragon and Jingo, led by hands. Par. Ye wondrous hands, who have led us so far, Pray are we welcome? (the hands shake) Jin. There—you see we are. Par. That gentle pressure sets my heart at ease. Jin. My hand is in a vice—oh! how you squeeze! (the hands vanish) Par. They're gone; and now, behold! two other pair Are wheeling towards each of us a chair. Jin. And there are four who bear a table steady, With every sort of thing for dinner ready! (to the chair as it approaches him) You're very kind—a thousand thanks to you— A little nearer. (pointing to table) Thank ye, that'll do. (sits and pours out a glass of wine) Delicious Burgundy! 'tis very clear We've fallen into friendly hands, sir, here. Par. I think so, too. I own I feel much braver— This show of hands is clearly in our favour. (the hands that have brought table and chairs disappear) Come, Jingo, let's do justice to the feast. Jin. (starting and looking out) Oh, look, sir, there's a cat, the nasty beast! (putting his hand to his cheek) Oh! zounds! Par. What ails you? Jin. Something scratched my face. Par. Beware how you abuse cats in this place; 'Tis evident they here have favour found; For now I see the walls are painted round With histories of every cat whose name Is written in the catalogue of fame. Jin. (trembling) What shall I do? I never could abide one. I've often almost fainted when I spied one. It comes this way—and riddle upon riddle! As sure as I stand here, it's got a fiddle! Music—Enter a Cat, full dressed, with a violin in its paw; he bows with great dignity to the Prince, and enters the Orchestra, which immediately fills with Cats, bearing other instruments and music books. Par. Behold, the orchestra is with them filling; Now here's a concert really worth a shilling! Jin. A la mew-sard, of course. Par. So I should say, And all first-rate mew-sicians in their way. A grand flourish of all the instruments, and a march, to which enters the White Cat attended by her Chamberlain and others. Par. What singular procession meets my sight? A lady cat of the most dazzling white! Attended as becomes a mighty queen; But in a mourning veil! What can it mean? Cat. Son of a king, welcome to my domain. Par. She speaks, she speaks! White Pussy, speak again! Cat. (addressing the orchestra) Welcome, in song, his Highness to these halls! Jin. (aside to Prince) If they're about to sing, look out for squalls. The leader preludizes on the violin, the Cats commence a vocal piece of mew-sic, which is almost immediately interrupted by Prince Paragon. Air—Prince Paragon—“Hush ye pretty warbling quire.” Hush! ye pretty warbling quire! Your shrilly strains Go through my brains; No more I do desire. Cat. No more—no more! his Highness does not choose. Par. I own such mew-sic does not me a-mews. Cat. Hast heard ought like it? Par. Sometimes—on the tiles. Jin. Would I were off—just fifteen thousand miles! Cat. Jingo! Jin. (starting) It knows my name! Cat. You look distress'd. Poor fool! I know the cause: you cats detest; It is a prejudice we'll strive to cure. In the meanwhile, your good will to ensure, We'll hand you over to the fairest pair Of hands that in our service ever were. Behold them! (a pair of hands appear) they will lead you where you'll be Well entertained; your master stays with me. (walks aside with Prince) Jin. Well, they are very fair, I must allow! Permit me—(takes one) soft as velvet, too, I vow! What taper fingers and what rosy tips! Allow me, pray, to press them to my lips. Air—Jingo—“The Duenna.” Ah, sure a pair was never seen, So finely formed by madam nature! Such hands as these must sure have been The hands of some most handsome creature! (Exit Jingo with the hands) Cat. The banquet waits; wil't please your highness sit And condescend with me to pick a bit? I trust you'll find that pasty rather nice; 'Tis made of pigeons; this is made of mice. Par. Of mice! Cat. Nay, don't be frightened, this is my dish, Cooked by my own cook in a sep'rate pie-dish; That is a jugged hare—and here I smell a rat. Par. I hope you don't expect me to touch that! Cat. You shall do nothing you don't wish to do; There's milk for me, but there's milk punch for you. I have the honour, sir, to lap your health. Par. Madam, permit me to drink yours. (aside) What wealth! What taste! what splendour! this must surely be A cat of most exceeding quality! (aloud) Madam, don't think me rude, but I beseech You tell me how you gained the gift of speech? For our attendants only mew and purr. Cat. I may not answer you that question, sir. Par. To put another, then, may I presume? What's on your paw? Cat. A miniature. Par. Of whom? Cat. Alas! Par. A lass! it looks more like a lad. Cat. I meant—Heigho! Par. You sigh—I've made you sad. Forgive me—I feel I've been indiscreet. Cat. Will you take anything, sir, more to eat? Par. No, not a morsel. Cat. Then, hands, take away. (hands remove table, &amp;c.) Par. The handiest work I've seen for many a day! Pray, may I ask you how your time you pass? Cat. Sometimes in hunting field-mice through the grass; Sometimes I run after a cotton ball, Or scamper o'er the palace—roof and all! Or dance a minuet; and you shall see My Chamberlain now dance the Cat's with me. Minuet de la Cour—White Cat and Herr Grimalki. Cat. Son of a king! although it grieves my heart, I must inform you it is time we part. Par. Is it so late? How long have I been here? Cat. You'll stare when I reply—a year! Par. A year! Cat. All but a day! Par. It does not seem an hour! Cat. You flatter me! Par. I wish I had the power! No words of mine could ever justice do To such an interesting cat as you! Cat. Oh! Prince, you're too polite; but let me jog Your memory, and ask you—where's the dog? Par. My dog? Cat. Aye! Have you then forgotten quite Your father's mandate? Par. Mercy! what a light Breaks in upon me! Cat. Were you not to bring A dog so small 'twould pass through his thumb ring Within a year? Par. I was—'tis hopeless now! The year has fled!—I've lost a crown, I vow. Cat. Not yet; I think I have a dog will do! A fairy gave it me—I'll give it you! Ho! hands within! Hand me the box of gold That on my toilet table stands! Music—Hands bring on the box—White Cat opens it, and takes out an acorn. Behold! Par. Why, that's an acorn—food, I've heard, for hogs; But what on earth has it to do with dogs? Cat. Just hold it to your ear! What say you now? Par. I could be sworn something went “Bow! wow! wow!” Cat. And you'd swear truly! In that acorn curled, Nestles the smallest spaniel in the world! Par. To take it out at once, may I make bold? Cat. You'd better not—perhaps it may catch cold! Wait till you see your sire, at all events, And give it him, with my best compliments! Par. Kindest of cats! But how return in time? Am I not in some very distant clime? 'Tis true that I came hither in a crack! Cat. And you shall go almost as quickly back. My stable has a wooden horse, sir, in it, Which can trot fifteen hundred miles a minute. Par. In harness? Cat. Yes. Par. If you say so, who'd doubt it? Cat. Once in my gig, don't bother yours about it. Par. Oh! how my gratitude can I evince? Cat. I beg you wouldn't mention it, sweet Prince. Forget me not, that's all that I implore, Your vehicle shall soon be at the door; At home in less than no time you will be; In the meanwhile, another dance you'll see; For in my court I have some clever apes, Who can of Moors and Chinese take the shapes, And to please you they now shall dance a measure. (Exit White Cat) Par. Madam, 'twill give me most uncommon pleasure. But I must not my faithful fool forget— Jingo! I'm off! Enter Jingo. Jin. Oh! master, don't go yet! Par. Not!—why, I thought you'd be delighted—stay, If you prefer it; but I must away. In pleasant company time flies so fast, You'll scarce believe it—but a year has passed! And to my father I must hurry back; Decide—and quickly. Jin. I am on the rack! 'Twixt love and duty I am torn—depart! Oh! those sweet hands! they've laid hold of my heart! And to cry “Hands off!” I in vain endeavour— Oh, sir, I am a greater fool than ever! Re-enter White Cat, followed by Moors and Chinese, according to the story. Ballet. Moorish Pas de Deux By Mr. Gilbert and Miss Ballin. Chinese, Messrs. T. Ridgway and J. Ridgway. Cat in Walnut Shells, Master H. Marshall. Moorish and Chinese Dancers, Messrs. Ireland, Moore, Heath, Gardner, Garden, Gough. Misses Ridgway, Payne, Hartley, Garner, Kendall, A. Kendall, Taylor, Platt, A. Payne, Reekie, Jones, Hatton. The scene opens or changes, and discovers the Wooden Horse, magnificently trapped and harnessed to a Fairy Car; the magic hands are holding flambeaux; Prince Paragon and Jingo enter the Car, which ascends as the Act Drop descends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —In the Palace of King Wunsuponatyme— The King and Minister discovered at table, after supper, drinking. Duet—King and Minister—(To its own tune.) We won't go home till morning, We won't go home till morning, We won't go home till morning, Till day-light doth appear! King. For this night ends the year. Min. And still no Princes here! King. I gave them all fair warning— And yet my mandate scorning— They won't be home till morning, When daylight does appear! (filling Minister's glass) We'll have no daylights here. Min. I'm getting rather queer! Both. But we won't go home till morning, &amp;c., &amp;c. (clock chimes) King. Hurrah! there goes eleven! One hour more, And their time's up! Min. They'll not be home before, Depend upon't! King. Worthy man, I do!— I owe this excellent idea to you! Min. Oh, sir! King. And shall remain for life your debtor! Min. (aside) If he would pay his debts, 'twould be much better! King. My three poor boys! it sets my bosom aching To think what useless trouble they are taking; In climes, far off, who knows what may occur there? Min. (aside) Yet, ere he'd yield the crown he'd see them further! King. Let's drink our “absent friends.” Min. Sir, very gladly. King. My distant relatives! I miss them sadly; Would they were here—their sight would so refresh us! Enter Page. Page. Prince Paragon, Prince Placid, and Prince Precious. King. Returned! Min. They must have dropped, sure, from the skies! King. All three? Page. All three! King. With dogs? Page. Of every size And sort! King. The puppies! Page. Poodles, pointers, harriers, Newfoundlands, pugs, hounds, greyhounds, turnspits, terriers! King. Had they been tarriers but another hour! Min. Take comfort, good my liege: you're yet in power— Have they a dog will pass through your thumb ring? If not, their hopes they to the dogs may fling. King. But if they should have one so very small? Min. Why 'twill be no great matter, after all! King. Don't joke! Min. By no means!—when you wish to lick A dog, 'tis easy, sir, to find a stick! And if your ring they have a dog can leap through, I'll find a hole as small which you can creep through! King. Amazing minister!—whoe'er may trudge it! Whilst you've such ways and means, you ne'er shall budge it! (aloud to Page) Admit the Princes! Page. Dogs and all, sir? King. No! Let them to kennel in the courts below! (Exit Page) Music—Enter Courtiers, &amp;c., and the Three Princes, ushered by Chamberlain. Air—Chamberlain—“Bow, wow, wow.” Great King, behold, your sons return'd from roving foreign climes in, The dogs they've brought are worthy celebration doggrel rhymes in; The finest of each breed they paid for without growl or grumble, And all behind the window wait, to make you their most humble. (Chorus of Dogs, without) Bow, wow, wow! (Chorus of Courtiers, within) Fol de riddle, riddle, riddle. (Chorus of Dogs, without) Bow, wow, wow! King. Sweet sons, my words you've quite mistaken!—Zounds! We didn't ask you for a pack of hounds. We only craved a pretty little pet,— The handsomest and smallest you could get. Pre. We know, sir, what you said about a ring, But thought you only joking. King. I, Joe King! “Joe King” was a notorious Jew money-lender of the period. Par. I have a very tiny dog, indeed: A creature of a most peculiar breed; Which I to purchase thought my bounden duty, At any price.—Ho! Jingo, bring in “Beauty.” Enter Jingo with a very shabby little cur in a string. King. The horrid little bandy-legged beast! Jin. Sir, of all handsome dogs this is the least. King. Yes, the least handsome!—vile equivocator!— But of a fright I never saw a greater! How dare you shew me such a filthy cur? Par. Pardon a jest of Jingo's, gracious sir! I've got the dog you wished for in my pocket! King. Eh, what! Beware, my wrath's a congreve rocket! Par. Deign, first, to hold that acorn to your ear. King. Odds bodikins!—why, what is this I hear!— Some magic spell my senses must deride; No acorn, surely, can have bark inside! Par. I think that acorn through your ring will go! Of course, the dog that's in it must, you know! King. Prove first there is one in it, for this passes Belief! Par. Your Majesty will need your glasses! (opens acorn) Behold! where snugly lies the little darling! King. Is it alive? Par. Why, hark!—'tis at you snarling! King. I am dumb-foundered!—struck all of a heap! (aside to Minister) Count, where's the hole through which I am to creep? Min. (aside) You can't deny that he has won the crown: But you are not obliged to pay it down; 'Tis true you said you meant to abdicate. But when? I don't remember any date. It may be now,—it may be ten years hence! King. Sensible man, whose words have every sense. Min. And listen! Par. All this whispering bodes no good; Jingo, where have you put the horse of wood? Jin. In a loose box, made of the same oak panel; I rubbed him down with beeswax and a flannel! Par. But did you give him nought to stop his cravings? Jin. A sieve of sawdust and a bag of shavings! King. (aside to Minister) My bosom's counsellor, the thought's perfection, I, as a child, will go by thy direction. (aloud) Dear boys, the pains that you have ta'en to please us, And of this weary weight, the crown, to ease us, Is most refreshing to our royal heart, And from our word, of course, we can't depart. Prince Paragon, before you we declare, Has won the prize, and shall become our heir, Provided always, as the law lays down, He finds a partner worthy of his crown; If not, whichever of the other twain Brings such a bride, instead of him shall reign! But mark! the maid must be of royal race; Of matchless beauty, both in form and face! And also one who for five years hath ne'er Been seen by any mortal anywhere. Now to my couch, like me, a downy one! Page. But what with all those dogs, sir, must be done? We have no kennels in which we can poke 'em! King. Give them two puddings'-ends a piece, and choke 'em. Flourish—Exeunt King and all but the Princes and Jingo. Pre. Ne'er seen by mortal anywhere! Why, brother! This is a greater wild-goose-chase than t'other! Pla. Ne'er seen by mortal anywhere! Ah, me! Where shall we look for what we cannot see? Jin. Why, where so many look in each direction For what they cannot see! All the Princes. What's that? Jin. Perfection! Pre. Perhaps that's what our royal dad may mean. A perfect lady he would have my queen! Par. Dad won't, as in the dog-case, strive to do one! Our bride's to wear a ring, and not go through one! Pla. Of course you wouldn't, for decorum's sake, Treat a bride just as you would treat bride cake! Well, “Faint heart never won fair lady yet,” So like another Cœlebs, off I'll set! (Exit Prince Placid Pre. And so will I! Farewell! (aside) I wonder where, “Th'Invisible Girl” An acoustic trick, with mechanical contrivances, exhibited at Saville House. has moved from Leicester Square? Who knows she might a lovely princess be, For all that anyone could ever see! (Exit Prince Precious) Par. (to Jingo) To this new move what say you, at first sight? He gives check with the queen! Jin. I'd move this night Back to the castle of our friendly cat! Par. Well, I'm astonished to hear you say that! Have you subdued your horror of her kind? Jin. Sir, I'm in love; and my love must be blind! For I've two hands before my eyes for ever. Par. Well, put the wooden horse to! we'll endeavour To find our way back to the cat's abode. Jin. The nag, depend upon it, knows the road; He's a good one to go, but to look at, a shocking horse! His sire was “Eclipse A celebrated race horse which ran in 1769. Sire to “Young Eclipse,” the winner of the Derby in 1781.,” but his dam was a “rocking-horse!” Duo—Prince Paragon and Jingo—Gallopade from “Gustave III.” Away, away, With spirits gay, Again we'll skim the milky way; And through the sky Our one-horse fly The Witches' “Broughams” shall all run by. 'Tis only fifteen thousand miles, And there are neither gates nor stiles; And lighted all the roads you go, As now they're not below, you know. By no mail train Could anybody faster hie; Steam would in vain Our one-horse power outvie; No points to turn, No second-class to smash the first, No sparks to burn. No boiler there to burst. Not Mr. Green, in his balloon, Has ever been so near the moon; And if the earth should chance to quake Up there we cannot feel the shake! Away, away, &amp;c. (Exeunt) Scene Second. —A Chamber in the Palace. Enter White Cat. Air—White Cat—“Nobody coming to marry me. All night I roam in the dark, For I better at night can see; And I look for my princely spark, But he doesn't return to me! And it's oh dear! what a sad cat I be! Oh dear, what shall I do? If he doesn't come back to marry me, Still a White Cat I must mew! Hope told a flattering tale. He won't return, And I must still with hopeless passion burn. He'll say I didn't ask him—he don't know I didn't dare—the greater was my woe! I could a tale unfold, but did I that, I should remain for ever a white cat. Hark! what was that?—methought that in the mews I heard the clattering of wooden shoes! It is the wooden horse and shay—oh joy! Cats, look alive, and pipe all hands a-hoy! Light up the palace—open all the shutters— Illuminate the walls, the towers, the gutters! My Prince returns his friend feline to cheer! Where stays my Paragon? Enter Prince Paragon. Par. Behold him here! No welcome guest, perhaps, by all this stir? Cat. Don't think I make light of your coming, sir; By this flare up, 'tis but my joy to shew you. Par. My pretty puss! I feel the more I know you The more I love you! Cat. If a cat could blush! I feel the blood up to my feelers rush! But come! you've had a long ride through the sky, And must be hungry! there's more pigeon pie! Par. Talk not of food, but give me poison rather. There never was a person like my father; He's sent me now a royal maid to find— A paragon of princely female kind, Whom mortal eye for years hath never seen. Ah, my sweet cat, would thou couldst be my queen! Unfilial as the world such deed might call, I'd pitch my father over, crown and all! Cat. He'd look exceeding black if you did that. And though most flattering to a little cat, Of such an act I wouldn't be the cause For worlds!—but I may find a saving clause. Par. Indeed! Oh, pussy, any claws of thine! Cat. You say so now, but may, perchance, decline The task imposed upon you when you know it! Par. Not I—I'm desperate; so, madam, go it! Cat. List, list!—oh, list! Par. In any corps you please. Cat. I mean “attention.” Par. Oh, I “stand at ease!” Cat. The hour is almost come when I must die. Par. Alas, poor puss! Cat. You say you love me? Par. I Adore you! Cat. Thank you—so, poor man, did he Whose portrait in this miniature you see. On his guitar, whilst playing me a tune, His custom always of an afternoon, A fiery dragon swallowed him. Par. The devil! To say the least of it, that wasn't civil! Cat. Brief let me be—that hour it was decreed That I by one resembling him should bleed! Par. Oh, horrible! most horrible!—I freeze!— Don't say we're like each other. Cat. As two peas. Par. I kill a cat! and such a cat as thee? Cat. 'Twill make for ever happy you and me. Par. How so? Cat. You then will have the best of wives. Par. Too dearly bought with one of your nine lives. Cat. Pity me not; but lend your serious hearing To this, my last request—with heart unfearing, First cut my head off. Par. Oh! Cat. Then just the tip Of this appendage off with scissors snip, And throw both instantly into the fire. Par. Madam, are you aware what you desire? Cat. Fully. Par. I cut you up in bits? I won't. Cat. I shall be much more cut up if you don't. Take a few minutes for consideration; 'Tis of events a strange concatenation, But be assured, that though I can't explain, It is the only way your ends to gain. (Exit White Cat) Par. Gain my own ends by cutting off another's! No! sooner let the kingdom be my brother's! I'll back and say so; yet a moment's pause; She said the act contained a saving clause! That it would make us happy both for life, And give me what I seek—a matchless wife! I'll do her bidding though my heart it break, And wear the willow ever for her sake. Air—Prince Paragon—“All round my hat.” All round my Cat, I will plant the green willow— All for my Cat, for a twelvemonth and a day; And if any body asks me, why I look so very ill, oh! I'll tell them the catastrophe that on my heart doth prey. All round my Cat, when a green turf is her pillow, All round my Cat for a twelvemonth I will stray, And though my eyes should weep a flood enough to turn a mill, oh! A cataract of tears could never wash my grief away! (Exit Prince Paragon) Scene Third. —Interior of the Palace. Enter White Cat (meeting Jingo). Cat. Ah, Jingo, so you came back with your master? You've conquer'd your dislike to cats much faster Than I expected. Jin. Madam, not completely; But you appear so kind, and speak so sweetly, That I can look on you without disgust. Cat. Most complimentary, indeed! I trust You'll learn to look on me with pleasure soon. Jin. I shouldn't wonder—if you grant the boon I now crave at your hands, or those you lent me. Oh, madam! if from madness you'll prevent me, Give me those hands in marriage. Cat. Gracious me! You have been much struck by those hands, I see. Jin. I never was by any hands so smitten; Do not refuse me, oh, most gracious kitten! Cat. But is your love returned? Jin. Beyond expression! Cat. So I should think—how could they make confession? Jin. Oh, with those fingers they talk very plainly, And I have woo'd, I'm proud to say, not vainly. When I came back you should have seen the meeting; The outstretched palms—the pulses wildly beating! While tears of joy adown my cheek were stealing; Oh, never tell me hands have got no feeling! Cat. Well, in your folly there's a kindly vein, And as you've their consent you mine shall gain. Jin. Oh, joy! Cat. You are a fond and faithful fool! You've served the Prince? Jin. Since first he went to school; My first post was a whipping post, you see; Whenever he was naughty they flogged me. Air—Jingo—(Not to its own tune.) In infancy our hopes and fears Were to each other known, And friendship in our riper years, Entwin'd our hearts in one! They whipp'd me for his first offence, As still the marks could prove, You'll say 'twas like my innocence, But that inspir'd my love! With a fol loll, &amp;c. Cat. You deserve credit for your great devotion. Jin. I fly to court, and kiss hands on promotion. (Exit Jingo) Enter Prince Paragon. Par. Madam, I come to do what you desire. Cat. It is the hour—behold the magic fire! Th'enchanted scimitar and fairy shears. Par. Oh, madam, I shall rust them with my tears. Cat. Strike, and fear nothing; you'll rejoice in time. She seats herself in chair, the back of which is to the audience; her head is seen above it, and her tail hangs down on one side. Par. Rejoice! to see you cut off in your prime; Oh, never! Enter Jingo, with the Pair of Hands. Jingo here!—who sent for you, sir? Jin. I've married nobody, and would introduce her; But what would you do, sir?—you look so pale. Par. Kill the White Cat, and burn her head and tail! Jin. For goodness sake, sir, choose some other fuel! Kill the White Cat!—you wouldn't be so cruel! Par. I must be cruel—only to be kind! Thus bad begins (cuts off Cat's head) and worse remains behind. (cuts off end of tail) Jin. Hands, hold me up! This act can ne'er be mended! Par. My task is done. The Princess Catarina appears in place of the White Cat, and at the same time Jingo perceives he holds the hands of Palmyra, a richly attired lady in waiting. Prin. And my enchantment's ended! Par. Astonishment! Jin. A lady—fair and tall! I've married somebody, then, after all. Par. Madam, who are you—Quick!—my fate decide! Prin. I was the White Cat; I am now your bride— Of course, provided you have no objection. Par. Madam, you are what I have sought—Perfection. Prin. I am the daughter of a monarch great, Who died and left me at the age of eight To an old fairy's care. By her contracted To a vile dwarf, I almost went distracted. When at fifteen, a Prince beheld and woo'd me; They killed him as I told you;—then pursued me, And into cats transformed me and my friends, Or left of some only the hands. Here ends My story: for the rest, sir, of my tale, You have cut short yourself. Par. Sweet Princess, hail, And reign for ever in this happy heart! Prin. Come, let us for your father's court depart. Your brothers are just entering the city, With two princesses, wondrous fair and witty. Jin. How shall we travel though—with each a bride? Your gig will never carry four inside. Prin. Oh, I have now my proper coach of state, And yonder my transformed attendants wait, In rich attire to dazzle all beholders, With each their cast-off cat-skin on their shoulders; The fairy railroad station is hard by, And by the fast train our vast train shall fly! (Exeunt Prince and Princess, Jingo and Lady) Scene Fourth. —Gates of the Capital City of Neverminditsnamia. Enter in procession: Prince Precious and Prince Placid, with their Brides, meeting the King, Minister, and Officers of his Court. Pre. Permit me, sire, my chosen bride to hand ye; The daughter of the King of Sugar-Candy. “She's all my fancy painted her”—and you Required, nearly— King. Nearly, sir, won't do. Still, with respect due to such rank, we greet Her Sugar-Candy Highness, and her suite. Pla. Sir, I can say no more than said my brother. Here is my choice; we doat on one another, And give up kingdoms for each others' sakes; Her sire is Emperor of all the Cakes. King. Your resignation proves that you must be The greatest cake he in his land could see! But who comes here in such alarming state? Enter Prince Paragon with Princess, Jingo, and Lady Palmyra, attended. Jin. Prince Paragon, with mate, to give check-mate! King. That boy will be the death of me, I vow! Par. Father, behold a princess, on whose brow My half-crown I should almost blush to place. King. Don't do it then, my child, in any case. We won't insist—we'll reign a little longer: These two last years I've really felt much stronger! Par. Great sir, your crown I shall no longer need, For to her royal father's I succeed; She's heiress to six kingdoms—more by three Than will suffice for us—so begs through me To offer to my brothers one a-piece, And with the third your own realms to increase. King. My darling! Oh, that's quite another story! (to Minister) I always said this boy would be my glory. Min. You did, my liege, and I agreed with you, King. Uncompromising man, you always do! Daughter-in-law, come to the old King's arms. Par. You'd scarce believe the owner of such charms Was for five years a poor little white cat! King. Don't tell me what she was; what matters that? See what she is!—I love her!—Puss or no Puss! Par. Here ends the tale,—“Finis coronat, O-puss”! Finale. Come, let us dance and sing, While all the City bells shall ring, Long life to everything! And our “White Cat” to boot! We'll be gay If our play Is by you approv'd to-day! Let kind hands still, Do her will, And foes as mice be mute! Tableau. CURTAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duet—King and Minister—(To its own tune.) We won't go home till morning, We won't go home till morning, We won't go home till morning, Till day-light doth appear! King. For this night ends the year. Min. And still no Princes here! King. I gave them all fair warning— And yet my mandate scorning— They won't be home till morning, When daylight does appear! (filling Minister's glass) We'll have no daylights here. Min. I'm getting rather queer! Both. But we won't go home till morning, &amp;c., &amp;c.</field>
