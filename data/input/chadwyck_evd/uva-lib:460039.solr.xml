      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. Havard. The Sons of Genius search, thro' ev'ry Age, For proper Heroes to adorn the Stage: Here Greeks and Romans rise again to View, Again fight bravely, and their Fame renew. The great unshaken Cato here you see, And Cæsar falls for English Liberty. No Standard-Virtue ripen'd yet on Earth, But you behold it in a second Birth; To strike, impress—impel the vig'rous Mind, And give ye all the Boasts of all Mankind. Such Spurs to Glory—if they Glory raise, Deserve Protection—nay, demand your Praise. Our Bard to night, no doubtful Story brings, Of native, genuine English Feats he sings: Here no false Varnish glitters to surprise, But just historic Truths in Order rise; And sure that Tale must have for Britons Charms, That shews you France subdu'd by British Arms: Our Lions traversing their ravag'd Plains, Their Armies broken, and their King in Chains. Our Poet fir'd by England's ancient Fame, (And humbly aiming at great Shakespear's Flame!) On Candour's Judgment bids his Hopes repose, Alike disdaining partial Friends and Foes. If his warm Glow excites a Patriot-Zeal, If from your Eyes soft Drops of Pity steal; If Fears, Hopes, Sorrows, rise with vary'd Art, And by the Hand of Nature touch the Heart; There let him reign—Be there his Pow'r confess'd, And gen'rous Judges will o'erlook the rest! With the humane and the exalted Mind, The Absent and the Dead, Indulgence find. Know then—a Parent breathing foreign Air, This Night commits his Darling to your Care. No Faction's form'd to prostitute Applause, No Art, no Int'rest, to support his Cause: The public Honour 'tis his Pride to trust, Nor can he think your Voice will be unjust. Attentive hear, unprejudic'd explore, And judge like Englishmen—he asks no more.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Scene, the Prince of Wales's Tent. Prince Edward discover'd seated, Warwick, Salisbury, Audley, Chandos, and others standing. PRINCE. My Lords, I summon'd ye in haste to Council. Intelligence is brought me that our Foes Have levied to oppose us, such a Strength As almost staggers Credibility! What's to be done? To tarry longer here, And brave their Fury in the heart of France, Would be a Rashness that may hazard all. Consider therefore well, my Fellow-Warriours, And aid my Judgment with your good Advice; Speak, Warwick, your Opinion. War. Royal Sir, It is for marching back, with speed, to Bourdeaux. Our little Army, harass'd with Fatigue And heavy-laden with the Spoils of War, Should like the careful Bees, ere Storm o'ertake us, Secure our Treasures and prepare for Rest. Havock has wanton'd in our hard Campaign, And manly Daring won Increase of Glory: Then let not now Presumption madly risk Reprisals from such Force. Be timely prudent: The Voice of Wisdom urges our Retreat, Obey it and be happy. Aud. Shameful Thought! What spirit Dastards by inglorious Flight? No; never let it, mighty Prince, be said That we who, two succeeding Summers, chac'd From Shore to Shore of their extensive Realm Collected Armies, doubling each our own! Should here at length discover abject Fear, And skulk for coward Safety. What are Numbers? Let all their Kingdom's Millions arm at once, And crowding, clust'ring, cram the Field of Fight! Such timid Throngs, with multiply'd Dismay, Would make Confusion do the Task of Valour, And work out their Destruction. Sal. Audley's Thoughts Accord with mine: While Salisbury has Breath, His Tongue shall hurl Defiance at their Force. Remember, princely Edward, Cressy's Field; Remember ev'ry Battle we have fought, How much out-counted, yet how greatly Victors! Loud were the Calls that broke our Sleep of Peace, And bade us rouse and buckle on our Arms: A Throne usurp'd, your Royal Father's Right; A violated Truce, a vile Attempt To filch away the Fruits of painful Conquest, By basely bribing Servants from their Duty. Assaults so infamous, such rank Dishonour, At last awoke our Monarch's high Resentment: O give it glorious Scope! Unhinge, destroy Their very Pow'r of doing future Wrongs: So shall the rescu'd World pour forth its Blessings, And Kings and Kingdoms thank our Arm for Safety. Chand. If Chandos gives his Voice for our Retreat 'Tis not from coward Motives: All can witness I have met Danger with as firm a Spirit As any in our Host. But as Success Hath crown'd our Arms with ample Spoils and Glory, Why, when the Season is so far advanc'd, (Hopeless of Profit) should we longer stay, By soothing Pride, to brave Adversity? Consider, gracious Prince, and you, my Lords, What Difficulties clog a Winter March In hostile Countries; Parties harassing, And want of all Convenience and Supplies. I do confess, the Wrongs that urg'd us hither Were such as merited severe Revenge: And Vengeance we have had. Their burning Towns Have lighted us on many a midnight March, While Shrieks and Groans, and Yellings echo'd round. Fear and Confusion were our Harbingers, And Death and Desolation our Attendants. Such have their Suff'rings been thro' two Campaigns, And that a third may rise with added Horrors, And carry Indignation to his Goal, Now homeward let us look; and wisely there Recruit, in time, our Vigour and our Numbers; Thence, with the chearful Spring to issue forth, Again to labour in the Field of Fame. Prince. True Wisdom, Chandos, dictates to your Tongue, And modest, manly Eloquence adorns it. My Lords of Salisbury and Audley, you, Who cherish Truth and Candour in your Minds, Must yield to Arguments so clear and strong. Believe me, Friends and Brothers of the War, A momentary Ruin may involve us: Such mighty Host are rais'd and now in Motion, As well will task our utmost Skill to scape. Upon the Plains of Poictiers are encamp'd, Th'extensive Plains that our Retreat must skirt, An Army double ours! Aud. And shall we pass? Go tamely by? And give 'em Cause for vaunting, That Englishmen avoided once a Battle? No; never let us merit such a Stain; But boldly seek 'em, dare their double Numbers, And drive 'em, if a Combat they decline, To skip and wanton at a safer Distance. Sal. Give us, my Prince, the Pleasure but to spring This gaudy Flight of prating Popinjays, And we'll retire contented. Chand. There my Voice Shall join ye, Lords: To force them from their Hold At such a Juncture, will be doubly glorious! Or should they venture Battle, their Discomfit Will render our Retreat to Bourdeaux safe, And end our Labours with a noble Triumph. Prince. Then be it so: For Poictiers we'll prepare. [Rising. Give instant Orders, good my Lords, for marching: To-morrow's Sun shall see us face our Foes. There, if they wait our coming, we once more Will dress Contention in her gorgon Horrors: Drive Fear and Slaughter thro' their shuddring Ranks, Stalk o'er their mangled Heaps, and, bath'd in Blood, Seize with red Hands the Wreath of Victory! Here break we off; go each where Duty calls. [Exeunt Lords. Prince solus. Now for an Office is most grateful to me. Who waits?—Let Arnold know that I expect him. [A Gentleman appears and retires again. How poor the Pomps and Trophies of the Field, The Blaze of Splendour, or that Bubble Praise, Compar'd with what the sympathizing Heart Feels from a gen'rous Action. Enter Arnold. Welcome, Arnold. I ne'er behold thy Face, but Pleasure springs With the Remembrance of those sprightly Days, Which led thro' early Youth our happy Friendship. Thou wert my Brother then; familiar Ease Season'd our Sports, and doubled each Delight. Thither my Soul, from ceremonious Pomp, And all the heavy Toils of high Command, Oft backward Looks, with Wishes to renew Those lively Transports unallay'd by Care, Our boundless Happiness, our Bursts of Joy! Arn. So honour'd, gracious Prince, as I have been, From humble Fortune rais'd to envy'd Greatness, And still with ev'ry Grace each Gift made precious! O what are Words in Payment for such Blessings! What, ev'n my Life! were Life itself laid down In Gratitude for such transcendent Goodness! Prince. If there's a Transport tow'ring to divine; If, in Atonement for its Load of Cares, One vast Enjoyment is the Gift of Greatness! 'Tis that we can bestow where Merit claims, And with our Favours chear or charm the Soul. Thine is the vacant military Post, By Mountford's Death reverted to my Gift; And keep thy Office in my Houshold still: I must not lose the Servant in the Soldier. Be henceforth both, and, what is more,—my Friend. Arn. How shall I praise— Prince. Arnold, I merit none. If thou hast Kindness done thee, I have Pleasure: There is no Joy a gen'rous Mind can know, Like that of giving Virtue its Reward. Nor ought such Payment be esteem'd a Bounty, For to deserve and give is equal Favour. But let me ask thee of thy beauteous Charge: How has the noble Mariana borne Captive Calamity? Arn. With Resignation Worthy her Birth and Dignity of Spirit! Forgetting her Misfortunes, all her Talk Turns on the Topic of your kind Protection. Prince. Let it extend to all that can relieve The Mind from harsh Reflexions on her State. We're now preparing for the Plains of Poictiers. Accommodate her on the wearying Way With thy best Care. Remember I request it. [Exit. Arnold solus. Arn. Rely, my Royal Master, on my Duty. Needless Injunction: Mariana's Charms Have given her here such absolute Command, My very Soul, my ev'ry Pow'r, is hers. But the cold Maid, whene'er I plead my Passion, Chills me with Sighs, and stifles all my Flame Of Love with streaming Tears. Benignant Heav'n! Bless'd as I am with Royal Edward's Favour, Add Mariana's Charms:—And all beyond Let mad Ambition grapple for and gain. [Exit. Scene changes to the French Camp. Enter Charney and the Archbishop of Sens. Char. My Lord of Sens, I gladly give your Grace A joyful Welcome to the Plains of Poictiers. You come the happy Harbinger of Comfort, Returning to old Charney's woe-worn Mind. The King's Approach revives my drooping Spirits, It feeds the dying Lamp of Life with Hope That I shall live to riot in Revenge. Those English Locusts, who devour our Wealth, Who spoil and slaughter with so wild a Fury— Grant, ye good Pow'rs! these Eyes may see destroy'd, And I shall die contented. Sens. Ev'ry Tongue Joins that Petition: Your Misfortunes, Lord, Most nearly touch the King. Char. O they are great!— The Pride of ancient Lineage treasur'd up, Trophies of War and Ornaments of Pomp, These won by Valour, those with Honour worn, Favours of Monarchs, and the Gifts of Heav'n! The Relicks of a glorious Ancestry Are, with the Mansion of my great Forefathers, A Heap of Ashes now—A wide-spread Ruin. My Age's Blessing too, an only Daughter! Torn from her Home to hard Captivity, The Prey, the Victim of a fell Revenge! O matchless Misery!—O Mariana!— Sens. Your Sorrows have been wept by ev'ry Eye: And all have wondred what should mark you out For such peculiar Vengeance. Char. Nothing but The Service done our Master, when I brib'd Their Governor to give up Calais to us: Who, like a Villain, broke his plighted Faith, And sacrific'd the gallant Troops I led To Edward's Fury: Slaughter'd all or taken, I was amongst the Train who grac'd his Triumph. There the proud King insulted me with Taunts; He call'd our Undertaking vile and base: With low'ring Brow and Bitterness of Speech, Adding, he hop'd the Fortune of his Arms Would give him to reward my Treachery. The Father's Wishes hath the Son accomplish'd! For which, may all the Rage of ev'ry Curse, Flames, Famines, Pestilences, Slaughters! join To root from Nature the detested Race. Sens. Grant it, good Heav'n!—But see! the Duke of Athens. Enter Athens. Char. Lord Constable! most welcome to my Arms. Ath. I thank you, noble Charney. Char. Are the Train Of Royal Warriours, Sir, arriv'd! Ath. They are. Char. O joyful Tidings! Sir, another Hour Shall speak, at large, my Pleasure to behold you: The present claims my Duty to the King. [Exit. Ath. My Lord of Sens, these secret Marches made From different Parts by our divided Host, May steal us on our unprepared Foes, And give our Arms, at length, an ample Vengeance. Sens. I greatly hope it. As I think, to-morrow, Or I mistook the King, they'll all be here? Ath. With early Day, the Instant we arriv'd, A numerous Party, led by Ribemont, Came up and join'd us. Those the Dauphin brings, Our last Division, are to march by Night; We may expect them with to-morrow's Dawn. Sens. See! Ribemont is here. Enter Ribemont. Rib. Why, this looks well!— Here's Bustle, Expedition! Once again We shine in Arms, and wear a Face of War. Sens. O may they never be again laid down, 'Till England is repaid with all the Plagues Her Sons have brought on France. My eager Soul, As does the fever'd Lip for Moisture, longs To see Destruction overwhelm that People. Rib. Indulge no guilty Hatred, rev'rend Lord. For fair Report, and let me add Experience, Picture them lovely to impartial Judgment. The World allows they're valiant, gen'rous, wise! Endow'd with all that dignifies our Nature! While for their Monarch—We'll appeal to Facts, And sure they speak him wonderful indeed! Did not Germania's ermin'd Princes meet, And as the most renown'd, the first of Men, Elect great Edward to Imperial Sway? While he, sublime in ever-conscious Glory, Disdaining Rule but on his native Throne, Saw Sovereigns offer Vassalage in vain! Then, to his Court, from ev'ry peopled Realm, Ev'n from our own did not the fam'd in Arms, The harness'd Knights repair to fill his Lifts? To take his Judgment in all Martial Strife? Submitting Int'rest, Honour, all was precious, And ev'n beyond Appeal! owning his Voice Like that of Heav'n! incapable of Error! Sens. It grates my Soul to hear a Frenchman talk Of greater Glories than he finds at home. Is not this Monarch you would make a God, Our Master's Enemy? Our Country's Foe?— Rib. A Foe he is, but he's a noble Foe!— I know his Worth, and therefore will I speak it. At our Attack of Calais, 'twas my Fortune To meet in Fight this Third King Edward's Sword. I found him all that Heathens held their Gods, Artful and mighty! (pardon the proud Vaunt) Too much for me to conquer. Long we stood Buckler to Buckler, clashing Steel to Steel, 'Till by superior Soldiership o'ercome, I yielded to a Monarch! but so well, With hardy Vigour, I sustain'd the Combat, That Freedom, ransomless, was my Reward. The Royal Victor, when he bade me go, Took from his Brow this String of Orient Wealth, Around my Temples twin'd the glittering Wreath, And cry'd—“Shine there, my Token of Applause.” O if his Valour wing'd Amazement high, Where was its Flight, when his heroic Soul, Forgetting that my Sword had aim'd his Slaughter, O'erlook'd all low Regards, all partial Ties, And gave a vanquish'd Enemy Renown! Sens. Detested Boast.—Ambition's Taint, my Lord, So warps, so biases the Soldier's Judgment— Rib. Hah! biases?—I tell thee, Priest, Ambition— When was it wanting in a Churchman's Soul? More odious there, and more pernicious far, Than when it fires the Warriour's Breast to Glory. But—down my Rage—Your Office should be peaceful— Your Habit's sacred—Let your Speech be suited. Sens. Reproving, Sir, you think you rail secure, And so secure remain—Howe'er your Cause Might bring ev'n your Allegiance into question. Rib. Said'st thou Allegiance?—What a vile Resort!— And would thy jaundic'd Malice stain my Fame?— But Loyalty, long prov'd, dares bid Defiance To all the base Perversion of thy Tongue. I praise my Foes, because they merit Praise: I'll praise them to the King!—And after fight 'em. My Soul disdains such narrow-hearted Spleen, As owns no Excellence beyond a Tribe, Or hates, from Envy, all superior Merit. Ath. Forbear, my Lord, consider you're enrag'd With one whose Function does forbid Revenge. Rib. Why does the meddling Priest provoke Resentment? Let him obey that Function: Preach Repentance To Money-scraping Misers, sordid Slaves, The cringing Minions of corrupted Courts, The Dregs of Stews and Tyrants of the Gown. There let his Zeal be vehement and loud, But not come here to sap the Soldier's Honour, And teach inglorious Lessons in a Camp. [Exit. Ath. Forgive him, good my Lord; brave Ribemont Is all the Warriour, bold above Restraint! Of Nature noble, but unpolish'd Manners. Sens. I do forgive him—Yet a Time may come— [Aside Ath. Sir, go we to the Presence? Sens. I attend you. Ath. There grant, ye Pow'rs! our Counsels may procure This Kingdom's Safety, and its Peace insure: In one brave Action may our Arms succeed, And in their Turn the daring English bleed. [Exeunt. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Scene, The English Camp. Enter Salisbury and Chandos, meeting. CHANDOS. Good-morrow, Salisbury, yon rising Sun, As was your Wish, beholds us here encamp'd Upon the Plains of Poictiers. Sal. Noble Chandos, It was my Wish; a Wish for England's Honour. To Frenchmen, whom so much we've aw'd and humbled, Methinks I would not give the least Pretence For Arrogance and Boasting. Enter Warwick. War. Valiant Lords, Wild Consternation reigns! Our Scouts have brought Intelligence the Enemy surrounds us! By sudden, secret Marches, they have drawn Their Troops from ev'ry fertile Province hither, And cut off our Retreat. Sal. Why then we'll fight them. War. Most fatal was our Yesterday's Advice, But 'tis his Highness Will we straight to Council: Haste, good my Lords, for on a single Hour, Perhaps a Minute, now our Fate depends. Sal. I'll not believe the French will dare attack us, How great soe'er their Numbers. But with Words We will not waste the Time that may be precious; Then to the Prince's Tent, my Lords, away. [Exeunt. Scene changes to a private Tent. Enter Arnold, leading Mariana. Arn. Now, lovely Captive, wilt thou doubly triumph! The happier Cause of France at length prevails, And we are all undone. Mar. What mean you, Arnold? Arn. Encircled here by thy whole Country's Force, Unable to sustain their fierce Assault, And all Retreat cut off! We have no Prospect But that of total Slaughter. Mar. Hear me, Heav'n! Who oft hast witness'd to the silent Tears, Stream'd down in Gratitude for gen'rous Treatment, Now witness (spite of all my Country suffers) That these descend in pity for my Foes. Arn. The fatal Accident again restores thee To Liberty, and Safety, while from me It cuts away all Hopes of Happiness. I wish not to outlive the bloody Hour Must give thee to thy Father, whose Abhorrence Of all that's English soon will interpose, And plunge my Soul for ever in Despair. Let then thy Fancy image what I feel!— Grief chokes the very Passages of Vent— And I want Utterance for— Mar. There is no Need. I know thy Heart, know all its tender Feelings, Know what sad Tumults Doubts and Fears create, Whose mingling Agonies, in wounded Minds, Sharpen a Torture poignant ev'n to Madness. If to thy Eloquence of Words and Looks, My Virgin Modesty and Captive State Have hitherto forbid my Tongue to answer, Yet sure my Eyes have told my Heart was thine. But now, away with Fears and Forms; Distress Bears me above Restraint, and I will own To Heav'n, to Earth, to thee, my Father, Country! That Arnold is most dear, most precious to me! Arn. Hold, my transported Heart!—Thou Heav'nly Maid— What Raptures rush at that enchanting Sound!— Happy as I am now, Destruction, come, O'erwhelm me in this Moment of my Bliss; Ne'er let me pine in hopeless Anguish more, But die thus clasp'd in Mariana's Arms. Mar. And will our Fate—will cruel Fate divide us? Arn. O do not name it: with the very Thought Frenzy assaults me: No, we must not, cannot, Will not be parted—No— Mar. Alas, I fear The Choice will not be ours. A Father's Pow'r, If France prevails, for ever tears thee from me. And must they Conquer?—O I find, I feel, I've lost already all Regard for France: England's my Country, any Country's mine That gives me but my Safety and my Love— Inform me—tell me—is there no escaping? Arn. Thou wilt need none. For me and for the rest, We have, alas, no Prospect but of— Mar. Stop! Nor dare inflame a wild Imagination, Lest Madness follow! 'midst relentless Foes, Methinks I see thee fall! Behold'em strike!— I hear thy Groans! I see thy gushing Blood! Thy writhing Body trampled in the Dust! O save me from the Horror!—Let us fly!— Let us away this Moment:—Let us— Arn. Whither? Where can we fly? All Hope of Flight is lost, There is no Possibility— Mar. There is. Let us, while yet Occasion will permit, Fly to my Father. Arn. Father!— Mar. He'll protect us. Arn. Protect us!—Dire Protection!—at the Thought My Blood runs chill! and Horror quite unmans me. Mar. Think on the Dangers that you brave by staying. Arn. Think, rather, on the Hell that I should merit By such Desertion—dire and damning Guilt! How dreadfully it shakes me!— Mar. Dost thou tremble? Then what should I, a helpless Woman, do? Imagine that! and if thou art a Man, Feel for what I may suffer. Arn. Suffer!—Thou? Mar. Yes, Arnold, I! The Woes that I may suffer. Amongst the deadly Dealings of the Field, Some well-aim'd Weapon, thro' a bleeding Wound, May set thy Soul at Liberty for ever. While I (of Mortals tho' the most undone) Wanting all Means of honourable Death, Must suffer Woes beyond Description dreadful. What are my Friends, my Father, or my Country? Cold are the Comforts that they all can give, When thou, dear Darling of my Heart, art lost. Pleasure and Hope, and Peace will perish with thee, And this forlorn, this joyless Bosom, then Become the dreary Mansion of Despair. Shall I not rave, blaspheme and rend my Locks? Devote the Hour that gave me Birth? and curse The Sun and Time, the World, myself and thee? 'Till Frenzy prompting, 'gainst some Dungeon Wall I dash my burning Brains to finish Torture. Arn. Do not awake, thou lovely Pleader, do not, Such Tumult-working Thoughts within a Mind On Madness verging. Mar. Let us then away. Arn. O not for Worlds!—Not Worlds should bribe me to it. Mar. And wilt thou urge thou lov'st me? Arn. More than Life! Mar. By Heav'n, 'tis false: The Spirit that's within thee, Is not of worth to harbour aught so noble. Arn. Will Daring ev'n to die convince thee? Mar. No: Death is a Coward's Refuge. Dare to live; Dare Wretchedness,—Reproach— Arn. No more, no more— Tempt me no more in vain— Mar. Art thou so fixt?— Arn. As Fate— Mar. I've done. Arn. Then why that angry Look?— Mar. It is a Curse entail'd upon the Sex To have our Counsel scorn'd, our Love despis'd. Go to thy Ruin—to my Ruin go— I give thee up—and all my Hopes for ever. Arn. Why wilt thou blast me with that baleful Dew? Each tender Tear that falls in Sorrow from thee (Like melted Ore fast dropping on my Heart) Drives Life before it with Excess of Pain. Come, friendly Slaughter, now my only Hope! Free me from Sufferings not to be endur'd. Mar. What! In the Hour of Trial wouldst thou shrink. Steal to the Shelter of a timeless Grave, And leave me on the Rack of dire Despair? Is this a Proof of that superior Spirit Asserted by the lordly Boaster, Man? O Shame upon thee— Arn. Hear me— Mar. Not the Winds, That hang the curling Billows in the Clouds— Are more impetuous than the Rage of Scorn That rises in my Bosom! Arn. Let but Reason Weigh the dire Consequence of such a Flight. Mar. The Consequence! Why, what do you forsake But certain Slaughter? Arn. Horrid,—damning Thought!— Mar. I hop'd my risking Wretchedness for Love, Would have provok'd some Emulation— Arn. Oh!— Mar. But thou art poor, the Hero of Pretence; And therefore thus—for ever— Arn. Take me, lead— No, stop!—it surely was some Siren's Voice Would lure me to Destruction.—Off!—stand off!— Thou!—thou art she that would ensnare my Soul, Ruin my Peace—and sacrifice my Fame. But timely be advis'd: Forbear to urge A Deed that all the Earth would scorn me for, All Hell want Plagues to punish. Mar. Be undone— Arn. Undone I am whatever Course I take— Dreadful Alternative! Despair, or Death, Or everlasting Shame!— Mar. I did not pause: I chose, for Arnold's Love to hazard all: To suffer, if Misfortune were our Lot, And never once reproach him or repine. But he rejects such Truth, such Tenderness— Arn. O hear me, help me,—save me, sacred Pow'rs— Mar. Deserts a Woman in Adversity! And seeks, in Death, a Rescue from the Woes Her Fortitude encounters. Arn. 'Tis too much,— It tears my Brain!—my Bosom!—oh! Mar. Thou'rt pale!— Arn. Dizzy and sick—the Objects swim before me;— Reach out thy Hand to save me ere I sink:— O What a Deprivation of all Pow'rs! Lead me to my Tent—I beg thee lead— Mar. I will. Lean fearless on my Arm, it can sustain thee. Arn. O boasted Manhood,—how I feel thy Weakness. [Exeunt. The Scene, opening, discovers a magnificent Pavilion, in which King John appears seated in State. On Stools, below him, sit the Dauphin, Dukes of Berry, Anjou, Tourain and Orleans, Athens, Sens, Ribemont, Charney, Lords, Attendants and Guards all standing. King. At length, we've caught these Lions in our Toils, These English Spoilers, who thro' all our Realm Have mark'd their Way with Rapine, Flames and Slaughters: Now, by my sacred Diadem, I swear, Beyond a Conqueror's Joy Pleasure swells, For that my Foes have wrought their own Confusion, And found Misfortunes where they meant to deal 'em. What say you, Lords, must softning Pity sway? Or shall we glut our Vengeance with their Blood? Char. Heav'n gives them up the Victims of your Wrath; Indulge it, then, to their Destruction. Mercy Would mark your Majesty the Foe of France. Your bleeding Country cries for Retribution: I join it, with a Voice by Woes enfeebled; Hear, feel and strike in such a moving Cause, The Cause of Wrongs, of Wounds, of weeping Age! The widow'd Bride, the childless Father calls: The helpless, parentless, unshelter'd Babe! Matrons, bewailing their whole Race cut off; And Virgins panting from the recent Rape! O hear, redress,—revenge us, Royal Sir, For Vengeance now is in your Pow'r to grant. Rib. Anger and Hatred are disgraceful Motives, Calm Dignity should ever counsel Kings, And govern all their Actions. When they strike, It ne'er should be to gratify Resentment, But, like the Arm omnipotent of Heav'n, To further Justice: To create an Awe May terrify from Evil:—better Minds— And benefit Society! Ath. The Nuncio, Who follow'd fast your Majesty to Poictiers, Hath sent to claim an Audience in behalf Of yon endanger'd English. Sen. Do not hear him. King. Say, Lord Archbishop, wherefore should we not? Sen. Knowing your godlike and forgiving Nature, I fear 'twill rob you of much martial Glory: Else might your Fame in Arms, for this Day's Action, Rival the Boasts of Macedon or Rome! And sure your valiant Soldiers will repine, To have the Laurels, now so near their Grasp, Snatch'd from their Hopes for ever. Rib. Abject Minion! How shameful to that Habit are such Flatteries. [Aside. King. Yes, I well know my Soldiers pant, impatient To seize this feeble Quarry. But our Foes, I must remind you, are so close beset, That Famine soon will throw 'em on our Mercy. Princes and Lords, what Cause have we to fight? Why should we waste a Drop of Gallic Blood, When Conquest may be ours on cheaper Terms? Dauph. But will it suit the Glory of your Arms To wait their Inclinaton to surrender? Or ev'n to grant such Parley, as might plume Their saucy Pride t'expect Capitulation? O no, my Royal Father, rush at once, O'erwhelm 'em, crush 'em, finish them by Slaughter. Rib. Think not, Prince Dauphin, they'll e'er stoop for Terms: Believe me, we have rather Cause to expect A fierce Attack, to cut their Passage thro', Or perish in the Attempt. I know them well, In many a Field have try'd their stubborn Spirit; Have won some Honour—by their King tho' vanquish'd. And when I ponder their intrepid Courage, How much they dare to suffer and attempt, I'm lost in wonder! and no Cressy need To make me tremble to provoke their Fury. Dauph. Your Tongue, the Herald of your Vanity, Methinks, is loud in what were better lost To all Remembrance—a disgraceful Tale. To boast of Honours from a Victor's Bounty, Is stooping low,—is taking abject Fame. If you have Valour give it manly Sway, Busy your Sword—but let your Tongue be silent. Rib. My Talent never 'twas to idly vaunt— King. No more of this—presumptuous Ribemont.— My Lords, we will determine yet on nothing.— I've sent a Spy, of known Abilities, To find out the Condition of our Foes; From whose Report, in Council, we'll resolve On Measures that may promise most Success. Mean time, do you inform the Nuncio, Athens, His Audience shall be granted. Lords, lead on: We'll make our Morning's Progress thro' the Camp. [Exeunt King, Prince, &amp;c. Manent Athens and Ribemont. Rib. What Boasts made I?— I told the Truth, and wherefore then this Taunt?— Shame on such Modesty!—The King, just now, Nice as he seems in Breeding and in Forms, With Patience heard a supple, fawning Priest— Strip all the Shrines of fam'd Antiquity, Ev'n make great Cæsar and the Son of Philip Resign their Laurels to his nobler Claim: Nay, thought him sparing, doubtless, that he left Great Hercules and Jove unspoil'd to grace him! By my good Sword,—an Oath with Soldiers sacred, I swear 'twould make an honest Stomach heave To see a Throat, so squeamish for another, Open and gulp a Potion down, enough To poison half Mankind. Ath. Brave Ribemont, The King's Distaste was that you prais'd his Foes. To talk of Cressy and of Edward's Feats, Was to remind him of our Crown's Disgrace: 'Twas to proclaim what we should wish forgotten, Our slaughter'd Armies, and our Monarch's Flight. Rib. What, are our Ears too delicate for Truth? If English Valour has disgrac'd our Arms, Instead of mean forgetting, we should stamp The hated Image stronger on our Minds; For ever murmur and for ever rage, 'Till thence eras'd by nobler Feats of Arms. Such are my Thoughts, and such my Resolution: I share our Country's Scandal, and would join My Sword, my Blood! to purge away the Stain. Ath. Here, then, Occasion meets that Patriot-wish; Here you may help to blanch our sully'd Glory. Rib. I differ, Athens, widely in Opinion: The Harvest is too thin, the Field too bare To yield the Reapers Honour. On my Soul; I pity the brave Handful we encircle, And almost wish myself an Englishman To share a Fate so noble. Ath. Gallant Spirit! Rib. Would our exulting King acquire Renown, Let him reduce his Numbers down to theirs. Then Sword to Sword, and Shield to Shield, oppose, In equal Strife, these wond'rous Sons of War. There Conquest would be glorious! but, as now, With all our Thousands and ten Thousands join'd, By Heav'n! 'tis most infamous to fight. Ath. I must away; my Duty calls me hence. I must applaud this generous Regard For a brave People that have done you Honour; Convinc'd, whene'er you face these fearless Foes, You'll fight 'em warmly as you've prais'd— Rib. Farewel— [Exeunt severally. Scene changes to the English Camp. Enter Audley and Chandos, meeting. Aud. You're well encounter'd, Chandos, where's the Prince? Chan. Directing the Entrenchments: Ev'ry Duty His active Ardor leads him to engross. Such Heav'nly Fortitude inflames his Soul, That all Beholders catch new Courage from it, And stifle with Astonishment their Fears! From cool unruffled Thoughts his Orders issue, While with the meanest Soldier he partakes In ev'ry Toil! inspiring by Example, A glorious Zeal and Spirit thro' the Camp. Aud. Yet feels he, as the Father of our Host, For ev'ry Man's Misfortune, but his own. Thrice have I seen him, in successive Rounds, Kindle new Courage in each drooping Heart, And drive all Fear, all Diffidence away. Yet on the Task would Tenderness intrude, As Dangers stole and imag'd on his Mind: When, pausing, he would turn his Head aside, Heave a sad Sigh, and drop a tender Tear. Enter Salisbury. Chand. Well, what says Salisbury? Sal. Why, faith, but little: It is yo. Frenchmen's Place to talk at present. Aud. How stand the Troops? Sal. Believe me, not so firm, But our light-footed Enemies, if dextr'ous, May trip up all their Heels. Chan. True to his Humour! My good Lord Salisbury will have his Gibe, Howe'er Affliction wrings. Sal. And wherefore not? Will burial Faces buy us our Escape? I wish they would: Then no Hibernian Hag, Whose Trade is Sorrow, should out-sadden me. But, as the Business stands, to weep or laugh, Alike is bootless; here is our Dependence. [Touching his Sword. Aud. What are their Numbers? Chan. Full an hundred thousand. Sal. Ours but some eight:—great Odds, my Friends!—no Matter; The more will be our Glory when we've beat them. Aud. What swells their Host so mightily's (I'm told) The Earls of Neydo, Saltsburg and Nassau, Have join'd their Troops. The Earl of Douglas too Assists them with three thousand hardy Scots, Their old and sure Allies. Chan. I hear the same. Sal. What! Scotchmen here? whose Monarch is our Pris'ner. Aud. Ta'en by a Priest and Woman! at the head Of such raw Numbers as their Haste could gather, When all our Vet'ran Warriours, with their King, Were winning Laurels on the Fields of France. Chan. And hither now, perhaps, his Subjects come To fight for Captives to exchange against him. Sal. For Captives! This poor Carcase they may get, When 'tis fit Booty for their Kites and Crows: But while this Tongue can speak, I'd root it out Ere Scot or Frenchman it should own my Master. Chan. The Prince approaches, Lords! Enter Prince, Warwick, and Attendants. Prince. Hah! saidst thou, Warwick! Arnold gone over to the Foe?— War. He is. A trusty Spy brought the Intelligence, Who saw him entering the adverse Camp, Leading his Captive Charge. Prince. Impossible! War. I've search'd his Quarters since, myself, and there Nor he or Mariana can be found. Prince. What has a Prince that can attract or bind The Faith of Friends, the Gratitude of Servants? Blush, Greatness, blush! Thy Pow'r is all but poor, Too impotent to bind one Bosom to thee— A Blow like this I was not arm'd to meet— It pierces to my Soul,— Sal. All-righteous Heav'n, Reward the Villain's Guilt!—Believe not, Prince, Throughout our Host, another can be found That Worlds would buy to such a base Revolt. Prince. I hope it,—will believe it, Salisbury. Yet must lament that one has prov'd so worthless.— I lov'd him too!—But since he has forgot The Ties of Duty, Gratitude, and Honour, Let us forget an Englishman could break 'em, And losing his Remembrance, lose the Shame.— My Lords, I have Dispatches in my Hand, Advising that the Nuncio-Cardinal, Good Perigort, is now arriv'd at Poictiers, And means to interpose in our behalf. Aud. His interposing is a gen'rous Office, And I applaud it; but, beleive me, Prince, Our Foes will rate their Mercy much too high. I'd hope as soon a Tiger, tasting Blood, Can feel Compassion, and release his Prey, As that a Frenchman will forgo Advantage. Prince. I've by the Messenger that brought my Letters, Sent him the Terms on which I warrant Treating. The Sum is, my Consent to render back The Castles, Towns, and Plunder we have taken, Since marching out of Bourdeaux: And to plight My Faith, that I, for sev'n succeeding Years, Will wield no hostile Sword against their Crown. Sal. It is too much: My Prince, it is too much. Give o'er such Traffic for inglorious Safety. Or let us die or conquer. Prince. Salisbury, Rely upon a Prince and Soldier's Promise, That Caution shan't betray us into Meanness. Heav'n knows, for me, I value Life so little, That I would spend it as an idle Breath, To serve my King, my Country,—nay my—Friend. To Calls like these our Honour bids us answer, Where ev'ry Hazard challenges Renown. But sure the Voice of Heav'n and Cry of Nature, Are loud against the Sacrifice of Thousands To giddy Rashness. O reflect, my Friends, I have a double delegated Trust, And must account to Heav'n and to my Father, For Lives ignobly sav'd, or madly lost. 'Till Perigort shall therefore bring their Terms, Suspend we all Resolves, but those receiv'd, Determination must be expeditious: For know our Stock of Stores will barely reach To furnish out the present Day's Subsistence. Aud. If so, Necessity, the last sad Guide Of all Misfortune's Children, will command. Chan. We must submit to what wise Heav'n decrees. Prince. Let that great Duty but direct the Mind, And Men will all be happily resign'd: Accept whate'er th'Almighty deigns to give, And die contented, or contented live: Embrace the Lot his Providence ordains, If deck'd with Laurels, or depress'd with Chains, Inur'd to Labour, or indulg'd with Rest, And think each Movement he decrees the best. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Scene, the French Camp. Enter Athens and Ribemont. RIBEMONT. Lord Constable, I was not in the Presence When Perigort had Audience of the King. Inform me, for I wish to know, does Peace Her Olive-Garland weave? or must the Sword Be kept unsheath'd, and Blood-fed Vengeance live? Ath. The King expecting me, I cannot tarry To let your Lordship know Particulars; But the good Father, who ev'n now set forward, Carries such Terms as, from my Soul, I wish Young Edward may accept: For 'tis resolv'd, If they're rejected, instant to attack 'em. Yonder's the Fugitive, I see, advancing, Who left their Camp this Morning. If we fight, And you have there a Friend you wish to save, This Man may point you to his Post. Farewel. [Exit. Ribemont solus. Rib. This Man—By Heav'n, there's Treason in his Aspect! That chearless Gloom, those Eyes that pore on Earth, That bended Body, and those folded Arms, Are Indications of a tortur'd Mind, And blazon equal Villany and Shame. In what a dire Condition is the Wretch, Who, in the Mirror of Reflexion, sees The hideous Stains of a polluted Soul!— To Corners then, as does the loathsome Toad, He crawls in Silence: There sequester'd chews The foamy Ferment of his pois'nous Gall, Hating himself, and fearing Fellowship. Enter Arnold, musing. Arn. What have I done! And where is my Reward?— Charney withholds his Daughter from my Arms, My flatter'd Recompence for—Hold, my Brain! Thought that, by timely coming, might have sav'd me, Is now too late, when all its Office serves But to awaken Horror! [Aside. Rib. I'll accost him.— Are you an Englishman? Arn. I had that Name, (O killing Question)—but have lost it now. Rib. Lost it indeed! Arn. Illustrious Ribemont! (For was your Person less rever'd and known By ev'ry Son of Britain, on your Brow That splendid Token of Renown you wear, Would be your Herald)—Pity, if you can, A Wretch—the most undone of all Mankind. Rib. I much mistake your Visage, or I've seen you In near Attendance on the Prince of Wales. Arn. I was indeed,—(O Scandal to confess it) I was his Follower, was his humble Friend; He favour'd, cherish'd,—Lov'd me!—Heav'nly Pow'rs! How shall I give my guilty Story Utterance!— Level your fiery Bolts!—Transfix me here!— Or hurl me howling to the Hell I merit. Rib. Invoke no Pow'r, a Conscience such as thine Is Hell enough for Mortal to endure. But let me ask thee, for my Wonder prompts me, What Bait affords the World, that could induce thee To wrong so godlike and so good a Master? Arn. True, he is all, is godlike, and is good! Edward, my Royal Master, is indeed A Prince beyond Example! Yet your Heart, If it has ever felt the Power of Beauty, Must mitigate the Crime of raging Love. Rib. Love!—Thou lost Wretch!—And could so frail a Fire Consume whate'er was great and manly in thee? Blot Virtue out, and root each nobler Passion Forth from thy Mind? The Thirst of bright Renown? A patriot fond Affection for thy Country? Zeal for thy Monarch's Glory? And the Tye Of sacred Friendship—by thy Prince ennobled?— Begone, and hide thy ignominious Head, Where human Eye may never penetrate; Avoid Society, for all Mankind Will fly the Fellowship of one like thee. Arn. Heav'n! wherefore said'st thou that we must not err, And yet made Woman? Rib. Why accuse you Heav'n? Curse your inglorious Heart for wanting Fire, The Fire that animates the nobly brave! The Fire that has renown'd the English Name, And made it such as ev'ry Age to come Shall strive to emulate,—but never reach— There thou wert mingled in a Blaze of Glory, Great,—to Amazement great!—But now how fall'n! Ev'n to the vilest of all Vassal Vileness, The despicable State of female Thraldom. Arn. From letter'd Story single out a Man, However great in Council or in Fight, Who ne'er was vanquish'd by a Woman's Charms. Rib. Let none stand forth, there is no Cause they should: Beauty's a Blessing to reward the brave; We take its Transports in relief from Toil, Allow its Hour, and languish in its Bonds: But that once ended, Dignity asserts Its Right in Manhood, and our Reason reigns. Arn. Untouch'd by Passion, all may talk it well; In Speculation who was e'er unwise? But Appetites assault like furious Storms, O'erbearing all that should resist their Rage, 'Till Vigour is worn down; and then succeeds A gloomy Calm—in which Reflexion arms Her Scorpion Brood—Remorse, Despair and Horror! Rib. But could Contrition ever yet restore To radiant Lustre a polluted Fame? Or Man, however merciful, forget That Justice brands Offenders for his Scorn? Truth, the great Touchstone of all human Actions, The fair Foundation of Applause or Blame, Has ting'd thy Honour with too foul a Stain, For all repentant Tears to wash away. All Eyes 'twill urge to dart their keen Reproaches, Each Tongue to hiss, and ev'ry Heart to heave With Indignation at thee. Arn. All the Pride, That here should kindle into high Resentment, I find is gone! My Spirit's sunk, debas'd! My Guilt unmans me—and I'm grown a Coward. [Aside. Rib. The Trumpets may awake, the Clarions swell, That noble Ardor thou no more canst feel, Disgrac'd from Soldier to a Renegade. Anon, while o'er the dreadful Field we drive, Or dealing Deaths, or daring slaught'ring Swords! Do thou at distance, like the dastard Hare, All trembling! seek thy Safety. Thence away, As Fortune, or thy Genius may direct, Thy Conscience thy Companion. But be sure, Whatever Land you burden with your Weight, Whatever People you hereafter join, Tell but your Tale, and they will all, like me, Pronounce you Abject, Infamous and Hateful. [Exit. Arnold solus. Arn. Abject and Hateful!—Infamous!—I'm all!— The World has not another Monster like me: Nor Hell in all its Store of horrid Evils, Beyond what I deserve!—Already here I feel the Shafts, they rankle in my Bosom! And active Thought anticipates Damnation. Enter Mariana and Louisa. Mar. He's here! I've found my Heart's Companion out! Rejoice, my Arnold, for my Father softens; He half forgets his Hatred to thy Country, And hears with Temper while I praise thy Virtues: We soon shall conquer. Hah! what mean those Tears? Why art thou thus? Arn. And can'st thou ask that Question? Thou soft Seducer, thou enchanting Mischief, Thou Blaster of my Virtue. But—begone— By Heav'n, the Poison looks so tempting yet, I fear to gaze myself in Love with Ruin. Away—away: Enjoy thy ill-got Freedom, And leave a Wretch devoted to Destruction. Mar. Destruction!—how the Image strikes my Soul, As would the Shaft of Death, with chilling Horror!— Hear me—but hear me!—'tis the Cause of Love! Your Mariana pleads.—For Arnold's Peace, For mine, for both—nay do not turn away, And with Unkindness dash the rising Hope, That strives for Birth, and struggles with Despair! Arn. O yes, despair!—it is most fit you should, As I must ever do. Mar. Wherefore?—Why?— How are you alter'd, or myself how chang'd, That all our Blessings are transform'd to Curses? Have you not sworn—(you did, and I believ'd you) My flatter'd Beauties and my faithful Love, Were all that Arnold wish'd to make him happy? Arn. Curst be your Love, and blasted all your Beauties, For they have robb'd me of my Peace and Honour. Looks not my Form as hideous as my Soul, Begrim'd like Hell, and blackned to a Fiend? Go, get thee hence—thou Blaster of my Fame, Bear thy bewitching Eyes where I no more May gaze my—but I've nothing now to lose, Nought but a hated Life, which any Hand Would be most merciful to rid me of. Mar. If I am guilty, 'tis the Guilt of Love, And Love should pardon what himself inspir'd. O smooth the Horrors of that anguish'd Brow, Thy tortur'd Visage fills me with Affright! Look on me kindly, look as you were wont, Or ease my bursting Heart, or strike me dead. Arn. Give me again my Innocence of Soul, Give me my forfeit Honour blanch'd anew, Cancel my Treasons to my Royal Master, Restore me to my Country's lost Esteem, To the sweet Hope of Mercy from above, And the calm Comforts of a virtuous Heart. Mar. Sure Kindness should not construe into Guilt My fond Endeavours to preserve thee mine, Life, Love and Freedom are before you all, Embrace the Blessings, and we yet are happy. Arn. What! with a Conscience sore and gall'd like mine? To stand the Glance of Scorn from ev'ry Eye? From ev'ry Finger the indignant Point? In ev'ry Whisper hear my spreading Shame? And groan and grovel a detested Outcast? A taunting Frenchman, with opprobrious Tongue, Pronounc'd me Abject, Infamous and Hateful! And yet I live!—And you yet counsel Life! The Damn'd beneath might find or fancy Ease, And fear to lose Existence soon as I!— No, die I must—I will—but how—how—how— Nay loose my Arm, you strive in vain to hold me. Mar. Upon my Knees—see, see these speaking Tears!— Arn. Be yet advis'd, nor urge me to an Outrage:— Thy Pow'r is lost—unhand me—then 'tis thus, Thus I renounce thy Beauties—thus thy Guilt— Life, Love and Treason I renounce for ever! [Exit. Mar. Then welcome Death, Distraction, ev'ry Curse! Blast me, ye Lightnings; strike me, roaring Thunders! Or let me tear, with my outrageous Hands, The peaceful Bosom of the Earth, and find A Refuge from my Woes and Life together. [Flinging herself on the Ground. Stand off—away—I will not be withheld— I will indulge my Phrenzy:—Loss of Reason Is now but loss of Torment—Cruel Arnold!— Enter Charney. Char. Whence is this Voice of Woe? This frantic Posture? Why is my Child, my Mariana thus? Mar. Thy flinty Heart can best resolve the Question: [Rising. Thou that relentless saw'st my Tears descend, And, urg'd by stubborn Haughtiness and Hatred, Hast given me up to endless Agonies. The Man that merited thy best Regard, The Man I lov'd, thy Cruelty has made Alike implacable: He's gone, he's lost! Arnold is lost, and my Repose for ever. Char. Why let him go, and may th'impending Ruins, The hov'ring Mischiefs that await their Arms, Him, them, and all of their detested Race, Involve in one Destruction. Mar. No, let Ruin O'ertake the proud, severe and unforgiving, Crimes that are Strangers to an English Nature. They are all gentle; He was mild as Mercy, Soft as the Smiles that mark a Mother's Joy, Clasping her new-born Infant. Shield him, Heav'n! Protect him, comfort him.—Thou cruel Father, Thou Cause of all my Sufferings, all my Woes! Give him me back, restore him to my Arms, My Life, my Lord, my Arnold! Give him to me, Or I will curse my Country, thee,—myself!— And die the Victim of despairing Love. [Exit. Char. Follow her, watch her, guard her from her Fury. [Exit Louisa. O dire Misfortune! this unhappy Stroke Surpasses all the Sorrows I have felt, And makes me wretched to the last Extreme. [Exit. The Scene drawing discovers the Prince of Wales seated in State in his Tent; at the Entrance to which his Standard stands displayed: The Device, three Ostrich Feathers, with the Motto of Ich Dien: Warwick, Salisbury, Audley, Chandos, Nobles, Officers and Guards standing. Prince. I've sent my Lords of Oxford, Suffolk, Cobham, To meet the Nuncio, and conduct him hither: From whom we may expect to hear the Terms On which the French will deign to give us Safety. [Trumpets. Chan. Those Trumpets speak the Cardinal's Arrival: And see!—the Lords conduct him to your Presence. [Trumpets. Enter three English Lords, preceding Cardinal Perigort and his Retinue. On the Nuncio's bowing, the Prince advances from his Seat and embraces him. Prince. Lord Cardinal, most welcome to my Arms: I greet you thus, as England's kindest Friend, Misfortune's Refuge, and Affliction's Hope. It is an Office worthy of your Goodness, To step betwixt our Danger and Destruction, Striving to ward from threatned thousands here The Blow of Fate. Per. Grant, gracious Heaven, I may! For from my Soul, great Prince, I wish your Rescue; And have Conditions from your Foes to offer, Which, if accepted, save ye. Prince. We attend. [Takes his Seat. Per. No Art for mild Persuasion in your Cause Have I omitted: But imperious France, Too fond of Vengeance, and too vain of Numbers, Insists on Terms, which only could be hop'd From such a scanty unprovided Host, And Prudence will direct, from many Evils To choose the lightest. Their Conditions are, “That to the Castles, Towns, and Plunder taken, “And offer'd now by you to be restor'd, “Your Royal Person, with an hundred Knights, “Are to be added Pris'ners at Discretion!” Prince. Hah! Pris'ners!— Aud. O insolent, detested Terms! Sal. An hundred thousand first of Frenchmen fall, And Carrion-taint the Air!—I cannot hold. [Aside. Prince. [After a Pause.] My good Lord Cardinal, what Act of mine Could ever usher to their Minds a Thought, That I would so submit?— Per. Could I prescribe, You should yourself be Umpire of the Terms; For well I know your noble Nature such, That Int'rest would be made the Slave of Honour. But to whate'er I urg'd, the King reply'd, “Remember Cressy's Fight! to us as fatal, “As that of Cannæ to the Roman State. “There fell two mighty Kings, three sovereign Princes, “Full thirty thousand valiant Men of Arms, “With all the Flower of French Nobility, “And of their firm Allies; for which (he cried) “What can redeem the Glory of my Crown, “But to behold those Victors in our Chains?” It is a bitter Potion; but reflect, That Royal John is noble, and will treat Such Foes with Dignity; while Fortune pays Less than the Stock of Fame his Father lost. Prince. Yes, Philip, lost the Battle with the odds Of three to one. In this, if they obtain it, They have our Numbers more than twelve times told, If we can trust Report. And yet, my Lord, We'll face these Numbers, fight 'em—Bravely fall! Ere stoop to linger loathsome Life away In Infamy and Bondage. Sir, I thank you,— I thank you from my Soul, for these,—for me,— That we have met your Wish to do us Kindness: But for the Terms our Foes demand, we scorn Such vile Conditions, and defy their Swords.— Tell 'em, my Lord, their Hope's too proudly plum'd, We will be conquer'd ere they call us Captives. Per. Famine or Slaughter— Prince. Let them both advance In all their horrid, most tremendous Forms! They'll meet, in us, with Men who'll starve, bleed—die! Ere wrong their Country, or their own Renown. Sound there to Arms!—My pious Friend—farewel. Disperse, my Lords, and spirit up the Troops!— Divide the last Remains of our Provision— We shall require no more; for who survives The Fury of this Day, will either find Enough from Booty,—or a Slave's Allowance. Per. How much at once I'm melted and amaz'd! Stop, my Lords, and give a Soul of Meekness Scope, In Minutes of such Peril. By the Host That circles Heav'n's high Throne, my bleeding Heart Is touch'd with so much Tenderness and Pity, I cannot yield ye to the dire Decision. Let me, once more, with ev'ry moving Art, Each soft Persuasion, try the Gallic King: Perhaps he may relent—permit the Trial— I would preserve such Worth, Heav'n knows I would! If hazard, labour,—Life! could buy your Safety. Prince. Lord Cardinal,—your Kindness quite unmans me My Mind was arm'd for ev'ry rough Encounter; But such Compassion saps my Fortitude, And forces Tears—They flow not for myself, But these endanger'd Followers of my Fortunes: Whom I behold as Fathers, Brothers, Friends! Here link'd together by the graceful Bonds Of Amity and Honour: All, to me For ever faithful, and for ever dear. The worth that rooted while my Fortune smil'd, You see not ev'n Adversity can shake! Think it not Weakness then that I lament them. Per. It is the loveliest Mark of Royal Virtue, 'Tis what demands our most exalted Praise, Is worthy of yourself—and must endear The best of Princes to the best of People. 'Till my Return be Hope your Comforter: If 'tis within the scope of human Means, I'll ward the Blow. Prince. Good Heav'n repay you, Sir: Tho' Acts of Kindness bear such Blessings with them As are their full Reward.—My Lord, farewel. [Exit Perigort, attended as he came in. Manent Prince, Warwick, Salisbury, Audley, Chandos, Nobles, Officers and Guards. Aud. Well, Sir, how fare you now? Prince. O! never better: If I have Frailty in me, Heav'n can tell, It is not for myself, but for my Friends. I've run no mean inglorious Race, and now, If it must end, 'tis no unlucky Time. As yon great Planet, thro' its radiant Course, Shoots, at his parting, the most pleasing Rays! So to high Characters a gallant Death Lends the best Lustre, and ennobles all. Aud. Why there, my Prince, you reach even Virtue's Summit: For this I love you with a fonder Flame, Than proud Prosperity could e'er inspire. 'Tis Triumph, this o'er Death!— Prince. And what is Death, That dreadful Evil to a guilty Mind, And awe of Coward Natures? 'Tis but Rest: Rest that should follow every arduous Toil, Relieve the Valiant, and reward the Good: Nor find we aught in Life to wish it longer, When Fame is once establish'd. War. That secure, Our Foes, who wail its Loss, can ne'er recover The Glory ravish'd from 'em. Prince. Who can tell— Has Fortune been so badly entertain'd That she should leave us? No, my noble Friends! Her Smiles and Favours never were abus'd: Then what we merit we may yet maintain. Chan. An hundred of us, with your Royal Person, Deliver'd up their Pris'ners at Discretion! The French have surely lost all Modesty, Or the Remembrance of themselves and us. Aud. But here, in my Mind's Tablet, there remains A Memorandum, that might make 'em start In this career of their presumptuous Hope. Nine times the Seasons scarce have danc'd their Rounds, Since the vain Father of their present King, Philip, who stil'd himself his Country's Fortune! Gaudy and garnish'd, with a numerous Host, Met our great Edward in the Field of Fight. I was one Knight in that Illustrious Service, And urge I may (for 'tis a modest Truth) We made the Frenchmen tremble to behold us: Their King himself turn'd pale at our appearance, And thought his own trim Troops, compar'd with ours, Effeminated Cowards.—Such they prov'd; And since that Day, what Change in them or us, Can ground Security on wondrous odds? The same undaunted Spirits dare the Combat; The same tough Sinews and well-temper'd Blades, Again shall mow them down, like Autumn Corn, Another Harvest of Renown and Glory. Chan. There the brave Monarch of Bohemia strove, In vain, to kindle Valour in their Hearts: He fought, he fell!—when our victorious Prince Seiz'd his gay Banner with yon Boast, “I serve:” [Pointing to the Prince's Standard. Which now more suited to his Princely Charge, Triumphantly, as Conqueror, he wears! And in his Honour England's eldest Hope Shall ever wear it, to the end of Time. Sal. Now as I live, I wish we were at work, And almost fear the Nuncio may succeed. Methinks we should not lose the blest Occasion, Or for surpassing ev'ry former Conquest, Or gaining glorious Death, immortal Fame. Prince. Then set we here ill Fortune at defiance, Secure, at least, of never-fading Honour. O my brave Leaders! in this warm Embrace, [They all embrace. Let us infuse that Fortitude of Soul, To all but England's daring Sons unknown; Firm as the stately Oak, our Island's Boast, Which fiercest Hurricanes assault in vain, We'll stand the driving Tempest of their Fury. And who shall shake our martial Glories from us? Yon puny Gauls! They ne'er have done it yet, Nor shall they now: O! never will we wrong, So far, ourselves and our renown'd Forefathers.— Here part we, Lords; attend your sev'ral Duties. Audley, distribute thro' the Camp Provisions— Keep ev'ry Soldier's Spirits in a Glow! 'Till from the French this final Message comes: Then, if their Pride denies us Terms of Honour, We'll rush outrageous on their vaunting Numbers; And teach them that with Souls resolv'd, like ours, Ev'n Desperation points the way to Conquest. When (in defiance of superior Might) Plung'd in the dreadful Storm of bloody Fight! Shall ev'ry Briton do his Country Right. Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Scene, The French Camp. Enter Ribemont solus. RIBEMONT. The Troops, array'd, stand ready to advance. And this short Pause, this silent Interval, With awful Horror strikes upon my Soul— I know not whence it comes, but till this Moment, Ne'er did I feel such Heaviness of Heart. Fear! thou art still a Stranger here; and Death Have I not seen in e'ery Form he wears? Defy'd him, fac'd him,—never fled him yet: Nor has my Conscience since contracted Guilt, The Parent of Dismay: then whence is this? Perhaps 'tis pity for yon hopeless Host— Pity,—for what?—the brave despise our Pity, For Death, encounter'd in a noble Cause, Comes like the gracious Lord of toiling Hinds, To end all Labours and bestow Reward. Then let me shake this Lethargy away— By Heav'n it wo'not off!—The Sweat of Death— Is on me!—a cold Tremor shakes my Joints!— My Feet seem riveted! my Blood congeals!— Almighty Pow'rs!—Those ever awful Form!— Why art thou present? Wherefore—What! a Sigh!— O smile of sweet Relief!—if aught from Heav'n A mortal Ear be worthy to—again That piteous Action!—that dejected Air!— Speak out the Cause—I beg thee speak—'tis gone!— Yet would I gaze, by such Enchantment bound— Thou pleasing,—dreadful Vision!—O return— Unfold thy Errand tho' I die with hearing— Enter Athens Ath. You're well encounter'd, Ribemont; the King, Ere this, has Edward's Answer; as I past The Bound'ries of our Camp on yonder Side, In this my Progress to equip the Field, I saw the Nuncio posting like the Wind! He and his Train, on Horses white with Foam, Their Course directed to our Monarch's Tent. What means this, Ribemont?—thou'rt lost in Thought! Rib. Athens!—I am unsoldier'd—I'm unman'd— Wonder you may, my noble Friend, for see I shake—I tremble!— Ath. Say, at what? Rib. Why—nothing. Ath. Should the vast Host that here are rang'd for Battle, (Warm with Impatience eager for the Fray) Behold that Ribemont alone has Fear, What Wonder would it cause! For thou, of all, Art sure deservingly the most renown'd. Come, be thyself—for Shame— Rib. Believe me, Athens, I am not stricken with a Coward's Feeling: Not all yon Army to this Sword oppos'd, Should damp my Vigour, or depress my Heart: 'Tis not the Soldier trembles—but the Son! Just now a Melancholy seiz'd my Soul, A sinking!—whence I knew not, 'till, at length, My Father's Image to my Sight appear'd, And struck me motionless! Ath. 'Twas only Fancy. Rib. O no, my Athens, plainly I beheld My Father in the Habit that he wore When, with paternal Smiles, he hung this Weapon Upon my youthful Thigh, biding me use it With Honour—only in my Country's Cause. Within my Mind I treasur'd up the Charge, And sacred to the Soldier's publick Call Have worn it ever. Wherefore then this Visit! Why in that Garb in which he fixt my Fortune, And charg'd me to repay his Care with Glory? If 'tis an Omen of impending Guilt, O Soul of him I honour, once again Come from thy Heav'n, and tell me what it is, Lest erring Ignorance undo my Fame. Ath. Nought but a waking Dream—a vapour'd Brain Rib. Once his pale Visage seem'd to wear a Smile! A Look of Approbation—not Reproof. But the next Moment, with uplifted Hands And heaving Bosom, sadly on the Earth He turn'd his Eyes, and sorely seem'd to weep! I heard—or fancy'd that I heard a Groan, As from the Ground his Look was rais'd to me! Then, shaking with a mournful Glance his Head, He melted into Air. Ath. Pr'ythee no more— You talk'd of Melancholy, that was all; Some Sickness of the Mind: Occasion'd, oft, Ev'n by the Fumes of indigested Meals: To-morrow we will laugh at this Delusion. Rib. To-morrow!—O that Mention of To-morrow— There are Opinions, Athens, that our Friends Can pass the Boundaries of Nature back, To warn us when the Hour of Death is nigh. If that thy Business was, thou aweful Shade! I thank thee, and this Interval of Life, However short, which Heaven vouchsafes me yet, I will endeavour as I ought to spend. Ath. See thro' yon Clouds of Dust, with much speed The Nuncio hastens to the English Camp! Perhaps the Terms for Safety are agreed, Then where's a meaning for thy fancy'd Vision? Rib. No matter where, my Spirits are grown light: Returning Vigour braces up again My Nerves and Sinews to their wonted Tone. My Heart beats freely, and, in nimble Rounds, The Streams of Life pursue their ready Course: Lead on; our Duty calls us to the King. Scene changes to the Prince of Wales's Tent. Enter Prince, Chandos, and Attendants, meeting Audley. Prince. Well, Audley, are the Soldiers all refresh'd? Aud. All: And although, perchance, their last of Meals, It seem'd so chearful as surpass'd my Hope, Still joining Hands, as off they drain'd the Bowl, Success to England's Arms was all the Cry. At length a hoary Vet'ran rais'd his Voice, And thus addrest his Fellows, “Courage, Brothers! “The French have never beat us, nor shall now. “Our great Third Edward's Fortune waits our Arms; “And his brave Son, whose formidable Helmet “Nods Terror to our Foes, directs the Fight! “In his black Armour, we will soon behold him “Piercing their throng'd Battalions! Shall not we, “At humble Distance, emulate his Ardor, “And gather Laurels to adorn his Triumph?” Then did they smile again, shake hand and shout! While, quite transported at the pleasing Sight, I wept, insensibly, with Love and Joy! Prince. I too could weep!—O Audley, Chandos, there, There rest I all my Hope!—My honest Soldiers, I know, will do their Duty. Enter Gentleman. Gent. Royal Sir, A Person, muffled in a close Disguise, Arriv'd this Instant from the adverse Camp, As he reports; solicits to receive An Audience of your Highness, and alone. Prince. Retire, my Lords.—Conduct him straightway in. [Exit Gent. Chan. Your Highness will not trust yourself unguarded: It may be dangerous. Consider, Sir.— Prince. Caution is now my Slave, and Fear I scorn: This is no Hour for idle Apprehensions. [Exeunt Lords, &amp;c. Enter Arnold in a Disguise, which he throws off. Your Business, Sir, with—Arnold!—Get thee hence. Arn. Behold a Wretch laid prostrate at your Feet, His guilty Neck ev'n humbled to the Earth; Tread on it, Sir,—it is most fit you should. I am unworthy Life, nor hope Compassion— But could not die 'till here I'd stream'd my Tears In token of Contrition, Pain and Shame. Prince. Up, and this Instant from my Sight remove, Ere Indignation urges me to pay Thy horrid Treasons with a Traitor's Fate. Arn. Death if I'd fear'd, I had not ventur'd hither; Conscious I merit all you can inflict: But doom'd to Torture as by Guilt I am, I hop'd some Ease in begging here to die; That I might manifest, where most I ought, My own Abhorrence of my hated Crime. Thus, on my Knees, lay I my Life before you; Nor ask Remission of the heavy Sentence, Your Justice must pronounce. Yet, Royal Sir, One little Favour let me humbly hope: (And may the Blessings of high Heav'n repay it:) 'Tis when you shall report my Crime and Suffering, Only to add—“He gave himself to Death, “The voluntary Victim of Remorse.” Prince. I shall disgrace my Soldiership, and melt To Woman's Weakness, at a Villain's Sorrow! O Justice! with thy Fillet seal my Eyes; Shut out, at once, his Tears, and hide my own. [Aside. Arn. Am I rejected in my low Petition For such a Boon!—Nor can I yet complain. Your Royal Favours follow Approbation, And I of all Mankind have least Pretence To hope the Bounty of a Word to ease me. Prince. Rise, Arnold,—Thou wert long my chosen Servant; An Infant-Fondness was our early Tie: But with our Years (Companions as we liv'd) Affection rooted, and Esteem grew Love. Nor was my Soul a Niggard to thy Wishes; There set no Sun but saw my Bounty flow, No Hour scarce past unmark'd by Favour from me. The Prince and Master yet I set apart, And singly here arraign thee in the Friend. Was it for thee, in Fortune's first Assault, Amidst these Thousands, all by far less favour'd, To be the first, the only to forsake me? Was it for thee, for thee to seek my Foe, And take thy Safety from the Means that sunk The Man, of all the World that lov'd thee most?— In spite of me my Eyes will overflow— And I must weep the Wrongs I should revenge. Arn. Tears for such Guilt as mine!—O blasting Sight!— Cover me, Mountains!—hide me and my Shame!— A Traitor's Fate would here be kind Relief From the excessive Anguish I endure. Prince. Having thus fairly stated our Account, How great's the Balance that appears against thee! And what remains?—I will not more reproach thee. Love thee I must not, and 'twere Guilt to pity. All that with Honour I can grant is this: Live—but remove for ever from my Sight. If I escape the Dangers that surround me, I must forget that Arnold e'er had Being: I must forget, in Pity to Mankind, (Lest it should freeze Affection in my Heart) That e'er such Friendship met with such Return. Arn. O Mercy more afflicting than ev'n Rage!— That I could answer to with Tears and Pray'rs; But conscious Shame, with Kindness, strikes me mute. Great Sir, (forgive Intrusion on your Goodness) My Boon you have mistaken, Life I ask'd not; 'Twas but to witness to the deep Remorse, That with a Harpy's Talons tears my Bosom. Love, the pernicious Pois'ner of my Honour, In poor Atonement's sacrific'd already: And Life, devoted as the All I've left, I'm ready now and resolute to pay. But as my Miseries have touch'd your Soul, And gain'd Remission of a Traitor's Fate, O add one Favour—and compleat my Wishes. To the dear Country that must scorn my Name, (Tho' I still love it as I honour you) Permit my Sword to lend its little Aid, To pay a dying Tribute: Grant but that, And I will weep my Gratitude with Blood. Prince. Stain'd and polluted as my Eyes behold thee, Honour no longer can endure thy Sight. If 'tis in Valour to accomplish it, Redeem thy Reputation; but if not, To fall in Fight will be thy happiest Hope. Away, nor more reply. Arn. Exalted Goodness. [Exit. Prince solus. Prince. If Passions conquer'd are our noblest Boasts, Misruling Anger, ever mad Revenge, And thou, too partial Biaser, Affection: Confess I once have acted as I ought. [Trumpets. Hah!—By those Trumpets, sure, the Nuncio's come! [A Gentleman appears and retires. Who's there?—Acquaint the Lords I wish to see 'em. Now does the Medley War begin to work! A thousand Hopes and Fears all crowd upon me!— Enter Warwick, Salisbury, Audley, Chandos, Lords and Attendants. O welcome Friends!—But see the Cardinal— [Trumpets. Enter Cardinal Perigort, attended. Well, gen'rous Advocate,—we wait our Doom. Per. Prepare, prepare, for an immediate Battle: Inflexible is France in her Demands, And all my Pray'rs and Tears have prov'd in vain. Prince. Lord Cardinal, may righteous Heav'n reward The pious Charity of Soul you've shewn. If France insists so high, it shall be try'd; The desp'rate Chance of Battle shall be try'd!— The Fates attend, the Balance is prepar'd; And whosoe'er shall have the Lot to mount, May Heav'n stretch wide its everlasting Doors, And give them happy Entrance all.— Per. Amen.— Illustrious Prince, and you his noble Followers, Remains there aught that I can do to serve ye? My Function suits not with a Field of Slaughter, In Poictiers, therefore, must I seek my Safety. There, while the Battle rages, round and round My Beads shall drop to Pray'rs, that ev'ry Saint Will succour and support the English Arms. But should the Fortune of your Foes prevail, And leave ye Victims to immortal Honour! The pious Offices I'll make my own, O'er ev'ry Grave to breathe a thousand Blessings, And water all your Ashes with my Tears. Prince. My gentle Friend—such Goodness will renown you. Per. Take from my Hand, my Heart,—my very Soul, My amplest Benediction to you all. [They bow. I now can stifle in my Tears no longer— O gallant Prince—farewel.—Farewel to all— Heav'n guard your Lives, and give your Arms Success! [Exit with his Attendants. On the Cardinal's going out, the Prince and Lords continue for some time fixt and mute. Aud. You loiter, Sir.—Our Enemies advance, And we're in no Array. Prince. Away, dispatch— Marshal the Army by the Plan I gave: Then march it straight to yonder Eminence: Whence I'll endeavour to inflame their Zeal, And fit them for the Toils this Day demands. [Exeunt severally. Scene changes to another Part of the English Camp. Enter Mariana and Louisa. Loui. Thus, Madam, has Obedience prov'd my Duty: The Hurry and Confusion of the Field Giving us Opportunity to 'scape, We've reach'd the English Camp. But whither now? Where would you bend your Course? behold, around, How the arm'd Soldiers, as they form in Ranks, Dart from impassion'd Looks ten thousand Terrors! The Scene is dreadful!— Mar. Then it suits my Mind, The Seat of Horrors terrible to bear. On,—let me find him— Loui. Dearest Lady, think— Nor follow one that rudely spurn'd you from him. Mar. It was not Arnold spurn'd me, 'twas his Guilt, The Guilt I plung'd him in. Louisa, thou Has ne'er experienc'd Passions in Extremes, Or thou would'st know that Love, and Hate, and Scorn! All Opposites together meet, and blend In the wild Whirl of a distracted Soul! Loui. Behold he comes! Mar. Support me, gracious Pow'rs!— Enter Arnold. Arn. Hah! Mariana!—when will Torture end! [Aside. Mar. How shall I stand the Shock of his Reproaches! [Aside. Arn. Why art thou here?—O why, unhappy Maid? Mar. Since my too fatal Rashness wrought thy Ruin, 'Tis fit, at least, that I should share it with thee. Therefore my Friends, my Father, and my Country, I have forsook for ever; and am come To claim a Portion here in all you suffer. Arn. Return again I beg thee; I conjure thee, By all the wondrous Love that fir'd our Hearts, And wrought—But let not that be more remember'd. If thou hast Wish for Happiness or Peace, Go to thy Father back, and think no more Of a lost Wretch who hastens to Oblivion. Mar. Request it not; I never will forsake thee: One Fortune shall conduct, one Fate involve us. I'll shew the World that my unhappy Crime Was neither Child of Treachery or Fear, But Love—Love only! and the Guilt it caus'd, As I inspir'd, I'll share its Punishment. Arn. You cannot, nay, you must not—think not of it: You broke no Faith—I only was to blame. And, to engage thee to secure thy Safety, Know the dire State of my determin'd Soul. Heav'n and my Prince permitting, I have sworn To brave all Dangers in the coming Fight: And when my Sword has done its best for England, To lay my Load of Misery and Shame Together down for ever, Death I'll hunt, So very closely that he shan't escape me. Be timely then in thy Retreat: And Heav'n! And all good Angels guard thee! On thy Lips I'll seal my fervent Pray'rs for Blessings on thee— [Kisses her. O what a Treasure does my Soul give up A Sacrifice to Honour!— [Going. Mar. Stop a Moment— One single Moment, Arnold: Let me gather A little Strength to bear this dreadful parting. And must it be—hold—hold, my Heart, for ever? O bitter Potion! Kind Physician, pour One Drop of Hope to sweeten it a little. Arn. Hope ev'ry thing: Hope all that Earth can give, Or Heav'n bestow on Virtues such as thine. [Trumpet. That Trumpet summons me!—I must away— O measure by thy own the Pangs I feel. [Exit. Mar. Then they are mighty; not to be express'd Not to be borne, nor ever to be cur'd. My Head runs round! my bursting Brain divides! O for an Ocean to ingulph me quick!— Or Flames capacious as all Hell's Extent! That I might plunge, and stifle Torture there. Loui. Hence, my dear Lady; for your Peace go hence. Mar. I'll dig these Eyes out; these pernicious Eyes, Enslaving Arnold, have undone him—Hah— [Trumpet. That Raven Trumpet sounds the Knell of Death!— Behold!—The dreadful bloody Work begins!— What ghastly Wounds!—What piteous, piercing Shrieks!— O stop that fatal Falchion! If it falls It kills my Arnold!—Save him, save him, save— [Exit running, Louisa follows. Scene changes to a rural Eminence, with the distant Prospect of a Camp. Enter Prince solus. Prince. The Hour advances, the decisive Hour, That lifts me to the Summit of Renown; Or leaves me, on the Earth, a lifeless Coarse.— The Buz and Bustle of the Field before me, The Twang of Bow-strings, and the Clash of Spears, With ev'ry Circumstance of Preparation, Strike a tremendous Awe!—Hark: Shouts are echo'd To drown Dismay, and blow up Resolution Ev'n to its utmost Swell!—From Hearts so firm, Whom Dangers fortify, and Toils inspire, What has a Leader not to hope! and yet The Weight of Apprehension weighs me down. O Soul of Nature! great, eternal Cause! [Kneels. Who gave and govern'st all that's here below! 'Tis by the Aid of thy Almighty Arm The Weak exist, the Virtuous are secure. If to your sacred Laws obedient ever, My Sword, my Soul, have own'd no other Guide!— O if your Honour, if the Rights of Men, My Country's Happiness, my King's Renown! Were Motives worthy of a Warriour's Zeal; Crown your poor Servant with Success this Day, And be the Praise and Glory all thy own. [Rises. Enter Audley. Aud. Now, Royal Edward, is the Hour at hand, That shall beyond the Boast of ancient Story, Ennoble English Arms; forgive my Hero, That I presume so far, but I have sworn To rise your Rival in the common Fight. We'll start together for the Goal of Glory, And work such Wonders, that our Fear-struck Foes Shall call us more than Mortals! As of old, Where matchless Vigour mark'd victorious Chiefs! The baffl'd Host, to cover their Disgrace, Cry'd out the Gods assum'd Commanders' Forms, And partial Heav'n had fought the Field against them! Prince. Audley, thy Soul is noble: Then together (Safe from the prying Eye of Observation) Let us unmask our Hearts. Alas, my Friend, To such a dreadful Precipice we're got, It giddies to look down! No Hold, no Hope, But in the Succour of Almighty Pow'r! For nothing but a Miracle can save us. Aud. I stifle Apprehensions as they rise, Nor e'er allow myself to weigh our Danger. Prince. 'Tis wisely done. And we'll, at least, endeavour (Like the brave Handful at Thermopylæ) To make such gallant Sacrifice of Life As shall confound our Enemies. O think On the great Glory of devoted Heroes, And let us emulate the godlike Flame, That dignify'd the Chiefs of Greece and Rome! Souls greatly rais'd, above all partial Bonds; Who knew no Tye, no Happiness distinct, But made the gen'ral Weal their only Care. That was their Aim, their Hope, their Pride!—the End For which they labour'd, suffer'd, conquer'd,—bled! Aud. Exalted, great Incitement! Prince. What may happen, Since none can say, prepare we for the worst. Then as a Man whom I have lov'd and honour'd, Come to my Arms, and take a kind Farewel. [They embrace. If we survive we will again embrace, And greet each other's everlasting Fame! If not, with him whose Justice never Errs, Remains our fit Reward. Aud. You melt me, Sir!— I thought my Nature was above such Weakness, But Tears will out— Prince. They're no Reproach to Manhood; But we've not Leisure now for their Indulgence. Aud. True, glorious Leader, to more active Duties The sev'ral Functions of our Souls are summon'd. Safety and Honour, Liberty, Renown! Hope's precious Prospect, and Possession's Bliss! All that are great or lovely; urge together, The Arm of Valour in their dear Defence. Prince. And Valour well shall answer the Demand; Our Foes, to wear the Trophies of the Day, Must wade thro' Blood to win 'em. Heav'n can tell How many Souls may pay the fatal Price, Or whose may be the Lot. If mine be one, Say, Audley, to my Father, to my Country, Living they had my Service;—at my Death, My Pray'rs and Wishes for eternal Welfare. Aud. Request not that which, if the Day be lost, I ne'er shall execute.—I have to ask A Favour, which I hope you'll not refuse. Prince. Nothing that suits my Audley to solicit. Aud. It is that I may be the first to charge: I think I can rely upon my Courage To set a good Example Prince. Be it thine— And see! the Troops approach!— [Trumpets. Aud. Each upright Form Darting Defiance as they move, to France! Where is the Pow'r can cope with Souls like these? Resolv'd on Conquest or a glorious Fate! Unmoveable as Rocks, they'll stand the Torrent Of rushing Fury, and disdain to shrink: But let yon panting Wasps discharge their Stings, And then in Clusters crush 'em. [Trumpets. Enter Warwick, Salisbury, Chandos and other Commanders. Parties of Soldiers appear between all the Wings, with Officers leading them, so seeming as if the whole Army was drawn up. Prince. Countrymen, We're here assembled for the toughest Fight, That ever strain'd the Force of English Arms. See yon wide Field with glitt'ring Numbers gay! Vain of their Strength, they challenge us for Slaves, And bid us yield their Pris'ners at Discretion. If there's an Englishman among ye all, Whose Soul can basely truckle to such Bondage; Let him depart. For me, I swear by Heav'n! By my great Father's Soul! and by my Fame! My Country ne'er shall pay a Ransom for me, Nor will I stoop to drag out Life in Bondage, And take my Pittance from a Frenchman's Hands: This I resolve and hope, brave Countrymen, Ye all resolve the same. Sold. All, all resolve it. Sal. Conquest or Death is ev'ry Briton's Choice. Prince. O glorious Choice! And know my gallant Soldiers, That Valour is superior far to Numbers, There are no Odds against the truly brave: Let us resolve on Conquest, and 'tis ours. But should the worst that can befal us—Death! 'Twill be a Fate to envy more than pity. And we have Fathers, Brothers, Sons or Friends, That will revenge our Slaughter. Sold. On, lead on. Prince. I see the gen'rous Indignation rise, That soon will shake the boasted Pow'r of France: Their Monarch trembles midst his gaudy Train, To think the Troops he now prepares to meet, Are such as never fainted yet with Toil. They're such as yet no Pow'r on Earth could awe, No Army baffle, and no Town withstand. Heav'ns with what Pleasure, with what Love I gaze, In ev'ry Face to view his Father's Greatness! Those Fathers, those undaunted Fathers, who In Gallic Blood have dy'd their Swords. Those Fathers who in Cyprus wrought such Feats, Who taught the Syracusians to submit, Tam'd the Calabrians, the fierce Saracens, And have subdu'd in many a stubborn Fight The Palestinean Warriours. Scotland's Fields, That have so oft been drench'd with native Gore, Bear noble Record! and the fertile Isle, Of fair Hibernia, by their Swords subjected, An ample Tribute and Obedience pays. On her high Mountains Wales receiv'd their Laws, And the whole World has witness'd to their Glory! Aud. Lead us to Action, and each Briton here Will prove himself the Son of those brave Fathers. Prince. View all yon glitt'ring Grandeur as your Spoils, The sure Reward of this Day's Victory. Strain ev'ry Faculty, and let your Minds, Your Hopes, your Ardours, reach their utmost Bounds! Follow your Standards with a fearless Spirit; Follow the great Examples of your Sires; Follow the noble Genius that inspires ye; Follow this Train of wise and valiant Leaders, Follow, in me, your Brother, Prince and Friend. Draw, fellow Soldiers,—catch th'inspiring Flame! We fight for England, Liberty and Fame. [They draw their Swords and go out. Trumpets sounding.] The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Scene, An extensive Plain, with the distant View of a Town: On one Side a Camp on a Level, on the other, another on a rising Ground. Enter Prince, Warwick, Chandos, and Attendants. Their Swords drawn. PRINCE. Haste to my Lord of Oxford, and request He ply his Archers with redoubled Vigour: [An Attendant bows, and goes out. I see already they've confus'd the Foe; Their Ranks are broken, and they seem to doubt If they should stand or fly! Chan. Then now's the Time To press 'em with the Weight of all our Force, For Frenchmen, if they're once dismay'd, are lost. War. Excess of Fury marks the Battle yonder! Lord Salisbury there sustains a heavy Charge. Prince. Warwick, away and reinforce his Party, Or Numbers may o'erbear him. Fly this Instant. [Exit Warwick. O for an Arm of Iron, but to answer The mighty Ardor that inflames my Soul! [Exeunt. Enter Arnold bloody. Arn. Yet more of Gallic Blood, I must have more, To wash my Stains of Infamy away. What are the Multitudes o'erthrown already? Greater must down to gratify my Rage, And in my Country's Vengeance crown my own. Hah! what! retreating!—Cowards—Follow me— [He joins an English Party who were giving way, and they beat the French off. Scene changes to another Part of the Field. Enter King John, Tourain, Athens, and Attendants. King. By Heav'n a Panick seizes all my Troops!— Inform me, Athens, what's the Cause of this? Ath. Some Parties, that the Prince of Wales detach'd Round yonder Mountain, have attack'd our Rear; And the Division which the Dauphin led, Dispersing in Confusion; they have pierc'd With Fury to the Centre of our Host! King. Fly, Athens, to my Son, with my Command That he collect again his scatter'd Men, And lead them to our Succour. Shameful Sight! [Ex. Ath. That such a Handful should confound us thus. Enter Archbishop of Sens with a drawn Sword. Sens. Confusion seize!—but there's no need to wish it, Too much it rages in our Host already. I got this Weapon from a feather'd Wretch, Who cast it down and skipt like any Deer!— I wish the Villain had it in his Heart. Howe'er, I took the keen Incumbrance up, And us'd it better than his Master could; For with this Arm, unpractis'd in the Office, I clove a brawny Briton to the Chine! Tour. Heav'ns, how we're prest!—No Party but gives way! King. Perdition seize the Cowards. Come, my Boy, We'll do our Duty tho' they all desert us. [Exeunt. Scene changes. Enter Arnold. Arn. My Arm begins to weary with the Fight; Death! I have cram'd thy rav'nous Jaws with Offal; Now, turn my Friend, and give me timely Rescue. Enter Ribemont. Rib. Thou double Traitor! must I stain my Sword With the foul Streams that circle in thy Veins, Who art so base, so branded—Infamous! By Heav'n it almost is a Guilt to fight thee. Arn. Here I can answer, for my Cause is good: It is my Country's! And thou, haughty Lord, Think not thou e'er again shalt awe my Soul, Or, unchastis'd, reproach me with a Crime I loath,—and here am come to expiate. The Earth Iv'e crimson'd with thy Country's Blood: And if the Pow'rs, to what is shed already, Will add but Ribemont's—I ask no more: The Foe I next may meet to mine is welcome. Rib. Can aught in Valour purge thy Æthiop Soul, Expunge thy Blots, and rank thee with the Brave? Dar'st thou assert the Cause thou hast betray'd? Or hope a second Guilt atones the first? No! the joint Vengeance of wrong'd France and England I send in this—[Arnold falls.] There's something of thy Due; To Infamy, and Hell, I leave the rest. [Exit. Arn. Death I have caught—his Shaft is in my Heart— It tugs with Nature.—When shall I get free— Enter Prince, Chandos, and Attendants. Prince. Slaughter hath wanton'd here! What Stream of Blood! What Heaps of mangled Bodies strew the Ground! Death has had able Ministers at work, A pompous Tribute they have paid indeed!— Arnold!—Hast thou done this!— Arn. Offended Prince, You find my flutt'ring Soul upon the Wing— All a poor desp'rate and despairing Wretch Could do, this Arm has wrought— Prince. Thrice have I mark'd Thy Valour wonderful! Arn. All worthless quite: That I could pay an hundred thousand Lives In Gratitude to you and Love for England, But feeble Nature fail'd my better Wish, So here I render up a lothsome Life— Prince. Talk not of dying:—Live, and still be mine. Arn. Too gen'rous Prince!—Could your benignant Heart Forgive and cherish one who was so vile?— Prince. As Heav'n may pardon me, thy Crime's forgot. Arn. Then I am happy. Hear it, sacred Pow'rs! And give him Glory great, as is his Goodness. I go—Methinks the gloomy Way before me Is stript of half its Horrors. Friendly Death, Receive a parting—pity'd—pardon'd—Oh!— [Dies. Chan. He dies!—Is gone. Prince. Proving, my noble Friend, His Soul was genuine English! and could tow'r O'er all Calamities but conscious Guilt. Chan. Heav'n's Pardon greet him.—Mighty Prince! behold Where gallant Audley, like a Tempest, pours Destruction thro' the thickest Ranks of Foes! Prince. O Chandos, with Astonishment! my Eye Hath mark'd his valiant wonder-working Sword! Come, let us kindle at the great Example, And emulate the Ardor we admire! [Exeunt. Scene changes. Enter King John, Tourain and Attendants. King. [Turning back.] Rally our Men, my Valiant Lord of Ewe, Or we are all undone.—O gracious Heav'n! How has a Kingdom crumbled from my Grasp! Tour. Let us preserve ourselves by timely Flight, Our broken Army is dispersing: See!— Behold the Dastards how they run in Thousands, O Shame! almost before a single Foe. King. My Dear Tourain—To what have I reduc'd thee? A Ruin now of Pomp!—A Royal Wretch! For thee I could weep Blood! For thee I fear To lose a Life no longer worth my Care, Stript as I am of Dignity and Fame. Tour. I ask of Heav'n but to partake your Fortune: Not wasting on myself a single Care, I send out all attendant on my King. King. Tears will have way:—O Majesty! give place, For Nature governs now, almighty Pow'rs! Must Children, and must Kingdoms suffer thus? Because my Pride to Reason shut my Ears, When dazzled with the gilded Phantom, Glory! I scorn'd the Terms that might have blest us all. Too late—It is the Curse of giddy Mortals To see their Errors, and repent too late. Enter Archbishop of Sens. Sens. The Dauphin, Dukes of Anjou, Berry, Orleans, Have led the Way in Flight! Earl Douglas follows, Fainting with many Wounds, and all his Scots Have, like our French and the Auxiliar Troops, Forsook their Posts. For Safety, Sir, away— King. Dare not to urge it—I disdain the Thought. Go, like my Coward Sons and Brother, go: Tho' all desert me, singly will I stand And face my Foes, 'till coverd o'er with Wounds, I gain a Fate becoming of a King. Enter Charney, bleeding and faint, resting on his Sword. Char. Embrace this Moment as your last for Flight, The Field is lost—I have not Breath for more.— This honest Wound came timely to my Rescue, Or I'd been curst to wail the Dregs of Life Away in Anguish.—Parent Earth, receive me.— [Lies down. This is the Goal to which all Nature runs, And I rejoice to reach it.—All is lost! My Country, Monarch, Daughter, Life, and—Oh! [Dies. King. Thou, Charney, hast escap'd— [A Shout. What noise is that? Tour. The Sound of Triumph.—Now there is no retreating, For, see! they have beset us all around. King. Come then, thou Darling of thy Father's Soul, We'll link our wretched Fortunes here together. And if a King's Example can inspire The few yet faithful in my lost Condition, Cast Fear behind, and daringly come on, Determin'd still to conquer or to die. [Exeunt. Scene opens to a full Prospect of the Field. Enter Ribemont solus. Rib. Ill-fated Athens, thou hast breath'd thy last,— But wherefore call'd I thee ill-fated? since Death but prevented thee the Curse of seeing Our Arms dishonour'd, and our Country lost. Now, sacred Soul of him who gave me Life, The Purpose of thy Visit is explain'd. No private Evil, not a Fate like mine— That were a trivial Call for thee to Earth: It was to warn me of a heavier Loss, Our Diadem and Fame. Hah!—I'm alone Amidst a Field of Foes!—let me collect A decent Vigour, like the hunted Lion, With an Assault to dignify my Fall, And not shrink, tamely, to a vulgar Fate. Enter Audley. Aud. For England— Rib. France—By Heav'n, the gallant Audley;— Now, Fortune, I forgive thy partial Dealing: For, next to Victory, my Wish has been To fall by so renown'd an Arm as Audley's. Aud. Brave Ribemont, I will return thy Praise, And own thee noblest of my Country's Foes. Had we been Natives of one happy Land, The gen'rous Semblance of our Souls had link'd us In Friendship's dearest Bonds. Rib. But here we stand Determin'd Champions in opposing Lists, Each in his Country's Cause, the other's Foe. Come, for I long to try this season'd Blade Upon true Metal. If I conquer thee, I take no Portion of the foul Disgrace, Which Heav'n this Day has thrown upon our Arms. But should my Fortune, (as perhaps it may) Like my poor Country's, bow the Head to England; Then, Audley, wilt thou add to thy Renown, By doing what thy King has only done, Baffle the Warriour he pronounc'd a brave one? Now for Determination. Aud. Hold a Moment.— Look on the Field, brave Ribemont; behold, Thou hast no Passage for Escape left open! Me should'st thou vanquish; from the thousands round thee, Captivity or Death must be thy Lot. Then make not Havock of great Qualities, Nor to thy Kingdom lose, thro' Desperation; The bravest Arm and noblest Heart it boasts. Give my fond Wish the Power but to protect thee— Resign thy Sword—I'll prove no Conqueror, But clasp thee with the warmth of gen'rous Friendship. Rib. Audley, I thank thee; but my Hour is come— You bid me look upon the Field; look thou, And see the Glory of my Country blasted! To lose a Day like this!—and to survive it— Would be a Wretchedness I'll ne'er endure. No; in a Nation's Fate be mine involv'd: To fall with France is now the only Means To satisfy my Soul, and save my Fame. Aud. O yet— Rib. I'm fixt: Aud. Why then—for England this— Rib. And this for France— [They fight some time, then stop. Aud. What! neither get the better? 'Tis a tough Task!—Again—[They fight again, then stop. Rib. Why, valiant Lord, The Balance still nods doubtful! as the Pow'rs Were undetermin'd which must yield the Day. Are our Fates grown of such high Consequence, That Heav'n should pause upon the great Decision! Let us no longer worry one another, Where can the vulnerable Spot be found? Aud. Why there—[They fight. Ribemont falls, and Audley is wounded and rests upon his Sword.] Rib. No, there. Aud. We are Companions still!— Rib. Inward I bleed: the Streams of Life run fast, And all that did invigorate deserts me. Audley, the Palm of Victory is thine; I yield, I die—but glory in my Fall: It is beneath the noblest English Arm! And that secures my Fame. Thy Bosom now May harbour him that is thy Foe no more. [Audley kneels and takes him in his Arms. Why, this is kind! thus lock'd in thy Embrace, To let a Rival Warrior breathe his last. Report me truly as thy Sword has found— I know thou wilt;—and, in the long Hereafter, If we can meet,—I'll thank thee for't.—Farewel. [Dies. Aud. Farewel, brave Ribemont; thou fearless Soldier. Peace to thy Ashes—to thy Soul Reward— And Honour crown thy Name! A Foe could weep! But Pity would disgrace a Death like thine. [Trumpets. Enter Prince, Chandos and Attendants. Prince. [Turning back.] Give instant Orders to recall our Parties; I will not hazard, by a rash Pursuit, So vast a Victory! And let my Standard Be hoisted on the highest neigh'bring Tree, To guide our Troops returning from the Chace. England, my Chandos, triumphs! For our Arms Have won the noblest Field that e'er was fought!— Hah! Audley bleeding!—then must Conquest mourn, And I lament, amidst my Spoils and Trophies, The best of Nobles, Warriors, and of Friends. Aud. Faint with the Loss of Blood—I hope no more. Prince. Summon Assistance;—all that Wealth can reach To him who gives me but his Life's Assurance. [Exit an Attendant. Advance that Banner o'er us.—Long, O long May'st thou survive to wear this well-won Honour. [He knights and embraces Audley. My bravest Knight—My most belov'd of Men, Lead him away,—Repose him in his Tent. Soon as the Hurry of the Field is o'er, I'll come in Person and attend his Cure. Aud. There lifeless lies the Arm that gave the Wound; A braver Soldier never press'd the Earth! On his Remains let due Distinction wait, To dignify the Dust that once was noble. [He is led off. Prince. The valiant Ribemont!—Take hence his Corps, And see that ev'ry solemn Rite be paid: With Honours suited to his high Renown, Conduct the Body to its peaceful Grave. [Ribemont carried off. Chan. The Field is thin'd! And now, far off remov'd, The dying Voice of Tumult faintly sounds, Like the hoarse Thunder in a distant Sky; Or hollow Roarings of subsiding Waves, After their Conflict with a furious Storm. Prince. An awful Horror!—The sad Scene before us, Pompous with Desolation! as declines The Glow and Ardor of our martial Flame Softens the Mind to mournful Meditation. How many Souls have ta'en eternal Flight; Who, but this very Morning, on the Wing Of Expectation, look'd thro' Years to come! So have the Bubbles of their Hopes been broke; So may it fare with us:—And such is Life! Enter Louisa, and falls on her Knees. Loui. O mighty Prince, whose matchless Virtues charm The many Realms your Victories have aw'd! Lend your Compassion,—your Protection lend To wretched, bleeding, dying Penitence. Prince. What would'st thou say— Loui. Unhappy Mariana, At once the Victim of distressful Love, And deep Remorse for Treachery— Prince. Go on. Loui. Frantic and weeping, ran o'er all the Field, 'Till Chance directed her to Arnold's Corps, That weltring lay in Blood. She kiss'd it oft, Bath'd it with Tears, tore her dishevel'd Locks, Smote her poor Bosom, sobb'd and sadly groan'd, 'Till snatching from his clay-cold Hand his Sword, She plung'd it sudden, in her Side!—sunk down— And call'd on Death to lock their last Embrace. I (but too late to save her) interpos'd, And cry'd for Help—alas! in vain. But now, Pluck'd by some passing Soldiers from the Body, They force her, raving and reluctant, hither. Prince. O Chandos!—what a moving Sight is here! Enter Soldiers forcing in Mariana, distracted and bleeding. Mar. Off, let me go—I will not be torn from him: Relentless Monsters!—Let us mingle Blood, And die together.—What do I behold!— O hide me, friendly Earth,—for ever hide me From that offended Face— [Sinks down. Prince. Look up, fair Mourner, [Kneeling by her. And gather Comfort from my friendly Tears. Mar. Comfort from thee?—Thou injur'd godlike Hero! Load me with Curses!—Stab me with Reproaches,— Thy Sweetness cannot!—but the Hand of Heav'n, That strikes for injur'd Virtue, heavy falls! And crushes me beneath it. Prince. Weep not thus.— Mar. What art thou made of, Heart! to bear all this? That grov'ling in the Dust—abandon'd— Prince. Nay, Do not be so wilful—And— Mar. Indeed, great Prince, The dear, departed Arnold was ensnar'd, Seduc'd—betray'd by me. But Heav'n can witness, My only Motive was his Preservation. Danger, Despair! provoked the guilty Deed; Which Horror, Death and Infamy reward. Forgive the breathless Soldier that rever'd, And Servant that ador'd you, Sir!—On me Heap all your Indignation; scorn, detest, Despise and hate my Memory for ever. Prince. No, both have my Compassion—my Forgiveness. Mar. Forgiveness said you?—O Celestial Sound! Catch it, ye Angels, hov'ring on the Wing, To waft me to the Bar of Heav'n's high Justice! Offended Virtue pities and forgives! Chaunt it aloud! and chear with this Foretaste Of Goodness infinite,—my Drooping—Oh!— [Dies. Chan. She's breathless! Prince. Heav'n, I hope, will think their Crime Enough was punish'd by Affliction here. Lay them together.—Well, my Lord of Warwick.— Enter Warwick. War. I've view'd the adverse Camp, as you commanded; Where all the Wealth of France was sure collected, To grace the Ruin of that wretched People: Each Tent profuse! Like those of Pompey's Host, When on Pharsalia's Plain he fought great Cæsar, And lost the World, his Life!—and Rome her Freedom. Prince. All-righteous Heav'n! thy Hand is here conspicuous! Pride and Presumption finish thus their Shame. [Shout. Hark!— Chan. 'Tis a Train of Pris'ners bringing hither. Enter Salisbury with Officers and Soidiers, conducting King John, the Duke of Tourain, Archbishop of Sens, and several French Noblemen, Prisoners. Prince. Brave Salisbury, you're welcome to my Arms. The Field is ours! Sal. And nobly was it fought!— Behold, my noble Prince, how well we have acquitted The Claims our Adversaries made on us. Your veteran Swordsman, Sir John Pelham, sends This Royal Trophy to adorn your Triumph. Prince. Most wise and valiant of all Christian Kings, Rever'd for Virtues, and renown'd in Arms! That I behold you thus, dissolves my Heart With tender Feeling; while I bend the Knee In humble Praise of that good Providence, Which gives so great a Victory to England! For you, great Monarch! Let your godlike Soul Strive with Adversity, and still preserve, As well you may, your Royal Mind unconquer'd. Fortune is partial in her Distributions: Could Merit always challenge its Reward, In other Lights we might this Hour have stood, Perhaps the Victor you, and I the Captive: But fear no Wrong, the Good should never fear it. This Land, from whence my Ancestors have sprung, By me shall not be injur'd. For yourself, And this illustrious Train of noble Pris'ners, My Care shall be to treat you as I ought. King. My gracious Conqueror, and kindest Cousin, This Goodness more than Victory renowns you! That I'm unfortunate is no Reproach, I brav'd all Dangers as became a King, 'Till by my coward Subjects left and lost. Prince. Lead to my Tent, when we are there arriv'd, Prepare a Banquet with all princely Pomp, At which I'll wait, and serve my Royal Guests. My noble Lords, and brave Companions all, I leave your Praise for the wide World to sound! Nor can the Voice of Fame, however loud, Out-speak the Merit of your matchless Deeds. O may Britannia's Sons thro' ev'ry Age, As they shall read of this so great Atchievement, Feel the recorded Victory inspire An Emulation of our martial Fire, When future Wrongs their Ardor shall excite, And future Princes lead them forth to fight! 'Till, by repeated Conquests, they obtain A Pow'r to awe the Earth and rule the Main! Each Tyrant Fetter gloriously unbind, And give their Liberty to all Mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Clive. Against such Odds if Edward could succeed, Our English Warriors once were great indeed: But, mournful Thought! we surely must complain, They're sadly alter'd from King Edward's Reign: Yet some there are, who merit ev'ry Praise, Stems of that Stock, and worthy of those Days; Illustrious Heroes!—How unlike to those, Whose Valour, like their Wit, lies only in their Clothes? Such arrant Beaux, so trim, so degagée, That ev'n French Ladies wou'd not run away. They'll huff, indeed, and strut, look proud, and swear, And all this they can do—because they dare. But know, poor Souls, all this implies no Merit, Ev'n Women soon discern a Man of Spirit; Judges alike of Warriors and of Wooers: The mightiest Talkers, are the poorest Doers. Such to subdue, requires no martial Fire, One Joan of Arc wou'd make 'em all retire. But hold—I wander,—Poictiers be my Story, And warm my Breast with British Love of Glory; When each bold Briton took his Country's Part, And wore her Freedom blazon'd on his Heart Such were our Sires—But now, O dire Disgrace! Lo, half their Offspring lost in Silk and Lace. Ye Britons, from this Lethargy arise, Burst forth from Folly's Bondage, and be wise: Once more let Virtue, Dignity, be priz'd: Nor copy what your Ancestors despis'd. Each false Refinement study to disdain, And harden into Manhood back again: So shall our Britain's Honours mount on high, And future Fields with that of Poictiers vie. FINIS.</field>
