AliÃ©nor, Raoul's repudiated wife SÅur Eulalie, Nun of St. Vincent's Convent at Senlis SÅur Lucia, Nun of St. Vincent's Convent at Senlis Philip II., King of France, Anna's young son Raoul de PÃ©ronne, Count of Valois Gervais, Archbishop of Rheims Count Fierabras Courtier Count Hugo Courtier Count Gosport Courtier Fernando, Raoul's Spanish page The Queen's Physician Huntsmen, Courtiers, Attendants</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SceneâAt or near Senlis; in the last Act at CrÃ©py-Valois</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Senlis, the forest. To the right a tent, the curtains of which are thrown open; in the centre of the scene a broad alley of over-arching trees ends in a view of St. Vincent's Tower and of the Royal Palace. To the left and to the extreme right lesser woodland alleys pass out of sight into distances of shade. Inside the tent Anna is bending over Philip, who supports an illuminated book on the edge of an old stone table, by which he kneels. A few attendants lie on the grass under the gold and motionless trees. The air is deep grey, as if an abrupt storm might break on it. Anna. My little son! Philip. Mother, I am attentive. Anna. Yesâthe book! But get the page by heart. [She turns from him and looks forth.] Is there no music For all this adverse joy that sweeps my soul Like devastation, yet begins so softly Just at some hidden point where pain begins. Something must say what I am suffering! 'Tis too immense for silence: lakes and ponds Lie flat and stagnant; every ocean lair Must have its murmurous rim. [She has paced beyond the tent and now turns back and pauses, watching Philip.] The child is rapt, Poring upon this âMirror of the World,â As if indeed it were the universe, And he unfolding all its envelopes To reach the centre. Fie upon me, fie! He is, or he should be, my very world, And all my life a Sabbath for the joy Just of beholding him ... my answered prayer, The very cry and foible of my heart, My king to be, my womanhoodâAh, no, For that would be as if God breathed the light He had created ... not my womanhood! I have been wife and mother; I am queen; These are mere offices. I see myself With my nurse in Russia stripping cranberries From the sharp, thorny boughs ... A holiday! Philip, put by your books. [She stands by him again in the tent.] Philip. But I am perfect, If you will hear my circles. First the earth, The air, the ether, then the firmament Above the watery sky. A Page. [At the tent-door.] Madam, the Count, Craving an instant's audience. Philip. Mother, stay ... I must repeat the circles. Anna. Oh this âMirror,â This âMirror of the World!â [Closing the book.] We must be patient, And kings are interrupted every hour. An instant, you shall teach me all the world Through all its varying spheres. [To the Page.] Admit the Count. [Enter Count Hugo from the Central Avenue.] Count Hugo! Hugo. Madam, there are counts and counts, And all your servants; but I had not ventured Myself to press upon your morning leisure. I come on urgent business from the Count, To plead for him. Anna. I cannot now attend. Hugo. He craves permission to retire from Senlis This very morning. Anna. It is not my will. Tell him this briefly. Hugo. You instruct our prince. How sweetly tutored! All the universe Is his in such a mother. Philip. When I rule, You shall not stop my studies. Hugo. Jealousy! Find me, my frowning King, among your figures The little door to Hell; I have the key: We will descend together. [To Anna.] Must I add The Count is absolute: he leaves to-day, Giving no reason, for his ChÃ¢teau Blois. In reverence to my Queen I have translated His bluff, defiant speech to courtesy. But do not sigh, fair lady; he reviles At every turn your majesty, and hints In terms so gross that you are amorousâ The boy is busy with his booksâyour knights And true liege servants suffer for the peril Your honour suffers. Anna. He remains at Senlis. Hugo. He will not. Philip. I have found the way to Hellâ This blot in the picture. Hugo. Madam, if indeed Being Queen, you are a woman ... Anna. Execute Count Raoul's business for him, if you will; But I dismiss you from my sylvan Court, And he remains. Hugo. To tempt in Paradise. Lady, my duty and obedience. [Exit Hugo. The wind begins to rise.] Anna. He shall not go, he must not. If he shouldâ Away, quite gone, why I should follow him Over the Asian steppes. Such solitude Breathes round me with his name! He is alone And absolute as God. But does God doom This exile from Himself? There is some darkness, Some bitter thing between. Philip. O mother, hearken! I hear the huntsmen; but I may not hunt; I must go back to Abbot AnseÃ¯s, Who never gives me holiday like you. Anna. [Kissing him.] Back to your studies, child! [Philip leaves the tent; two pages advance to fetch his book; they carry it behind him as he goes down the avenue.] They all will come, And find me blanched and trembling. ... Some will jeer. [She comes out of the tent and looks back on the alleys.] Is the child gone? To have him by my side, To teach him horsemanship, to be at least The dowager great queen! The boy has passed, And I must face my courtiers alone, Bear the exposure of my thwarted will, Andâbut they bring me âSenlac;â he is fleet. [Raoul advances round the back of the tent and speaks to the Queen's squires.] Raoul. Forbear awhile. [To Anna.] Good morrow, Queen. Anna. We hunt, Count Raoul, and you do not come attiredâ Not for the chase. Raoul. I am a traveller: I have affairs with Rome. Anna. You are a pilgrim? Raoul. [Laughing.] With staff and scallop! No: the Pope must send To me his message. So I take my leave. I start for CrÃ©py. Can you say farewell? How the dogs plague you! Do not speak to them. Give me farewell and liberty. Anna. Farewell! [They stand silent an instant.] You were so eager to be gone; you pause. Raoul. You do not seeâyour eyes are on the groundâ Your Court is mustering in the avenue. Anna. Why then, farewell, and I will meet my Court. Raoul. No, my fair Sovereign, I will keep my place Beside you, as your courtier. At least You shall not bear the gibes your foolishness Of too free grace have given warrant to; But I beseech you do not put my pride To further trial. [Enter Count Gosport, Count Fierabras, and other Courtiers, the Queen's Physician and Fernando The wind continues to increase.] Anna. Clouded brows, my lords! I fear 'tis heaven's clouding, for this storm Forbids our pastime; there will be a storm. Count Gosport. A storm to keep our Count from journeying. Sir Raoul, you are clad a traveller, And yet defer your starting for a gale. 'Tis prudent. Count Fierabras. Nay, nay, 'tis obedience. Our Queen has charged Sir Raoul, as his Queen, His Queen and mistress, his ... Anna. I bade farewell, Farewell and yet farewell, till it has rung In echo through the woods; but I must learn That other royalties beside my own Have their caprice and tyranny. [Facing the oncoming storm.] I bow. Count Fierabras. But our fair sport is spoiled. Anna. My lords, not mine. So brave a morning; and we are not old Save as the season: liberal in sighs, But then they are regrets, and the sweet moment We drink deliciously. The winter come, We take the gentle respite of this gale That whispers, wails, and yet exhilarates, Catching the early frost. I am so happy! My Count of Valois, have you no ambition Left for your huntsman's valour? You may win ... What, with this autumn morning? I must lead you Where the great scarlet pear-trees of the valley Will rouse with blood of battle those dead eyes That stare so gloomily. Come, gentlemen, Let us disperse companion-wise. My orchards, Dreaming their fruit again, are still most dear And good, if not for feasting, for retreat, Though the thick turf is frosted. O Physician, That deprecating gesture! Physician. It is wet, The fern high-branched and stubborn; if you wander These forest-tracks ... Fernando. [Springing forward.] But I will hold your dress, Will swish aside the brambles. Anna. And the dew! Fernando, can you brush it from the tracks? No, my fair lieges, I will tread no more On paths prepared. Henceforward, as I choose, I walk and catch the briars. [She offers Raoul her hand; he takes it gloomily, and they pass away among the trees.] Count Fierabras. St. GenviÃ¨ve, Our Queen is lost. Fernando. She has the noblest escort, The strongest in the world. What king, my lords, Has vassals like his titles; in himself Raoul le Grand most absolute, and Count Beside of CrÃ©py-Valois, Amiens, Vitry, PÃ©ronne, Montdidier ... Count Fierabras. Can he shield her From the small, winking archer of the woods, Dan Cupid? Boy, we will not doubt your master; But, say, does not our Sovereign favour him With more than royal favour? Count Gosport. Ay, Sir Page; And you have peeped in privacy. Fernando. My lord Dismisses me when he is with the Queen. Physician. Why, this is worse and worse. I see no cure For this complaintâeh, eh! Count Fierabras. You are dismissed. But if you turn your head, the door ajar, Has the scene altered? Does she kiss your lord Upon the cheek, and sigh, and then return, As one inhales the perfume of a flower, Rests for an instant from the luscious bell, Then diving for dear life ... Count Gosport. Ho, ho! You blush! So you betray your master. Fernando. BlessÃ¨d Virgin, How shall I speak before vile ears nor lie? My lords, I am ashamed thought of dishonour Can mingle with your image of the Queen. You are her servants: I, Sir Raoul's page, Swear that he gives her unpolluted service, Most distant, of chill courtesy, almost A Spaniard's in reserve. Physician. He knows the trick, He will not court dismissal like a fool. Count Fierabras. Well, I have roused suspicion in the Count, By sharp, decisive comment on the Queen, That she is toying with him, that she laughs When his brow burns beneath her smile. He suffers Outrageous torment, as a thousand hornets Played on the quivering dewlaps of a bull. Trust me he suffers. Count Gosport. Ah, he saved your life Once at a tourney: you must take revenge. Count Fierabras. Simply by idle speeches on the air; By hints. ... He still is smarting from the shame Fair AliÃ©nor has heaped upon his head ... I hint he is so handsome, and divorced, He tempts our Queen to trifle. Then his rage Is levin at his lipsâno speech, a quiver. I shrug my shoulders. Count Gosport. Is the rumour true Of this divorce? Has Rome yet widowed him? His glorious wanton has a pious soul, And passions of a tiger. Count Fierabras. He is free; He has flung her off for ever, and his torment Is to yield worship, with the doubts of hell Knotting his heart, to a benignant goddess, Who gives him all he asks, receives his prayers Who ... But discretion! Fernando. Gentlemen, forbear, I am a Spaniard and I follow little What your vile phrases mean; but as a Spaniard I say you lie, if you accuse ... Count Fierabras. Your lord? Or the King's mother? Fernando. In the light she stands White as the sunshine Count Fierabras. You defend a queen, You give the lie to belted knights of France ... [They all draw their swords.] Because your blood is Spanish. Let it flow! Is that the colourâha? [He wounds Fernando, who falls with a cry. Kissing a little cross on his breast, he swoons.] A scratch! Physician, You must not make us enemies. A scar, No proffered harm to life, a chastisement; To Raoul a slight menace. Best retire. A hurt that needs no dressing! Physician. [Staunching the wound.] 'Tis not fatal! [Apart.] But yet I will return. [They go out down the central avenue. The wind breaks over Fernando as he lies. In a pause Raoul and Anna re-enter by the avenue to the right.] Raoul. The gale increases. Anna. Yes, one must pause an instant to take breath. Look through the trees, look through the blueâthe clouding Of the wind-blinded plain. Oh, I must rest! Raoul. This wandering with no goal. ... Lady, I hunt, And fight, and give command. To front a force I neither may defy nor overcome Is little to my taste. This howling wind ... Anna. Flutters my veil aside. Raoul. You court its touch. Anna. The veil is teazing. Will you draw it close? Raoul. At your command, with comment on the face. How beautiful you are, and the mad wind Has dared to flush you. I have seen you pale, Dead pale, unruffled: in this boorish storm You lose your queenship. I conduct you home. Lady, your hand! [Stepping before Fernando.] What business have you here? Fernando, bleeding? Nay, the wound is dressed. You cannot rise alone. I love you, boy. ... What foe of mine dare stab you? Fernando. The whole Court, Soon as your back was turned, proclaimed you traitor, Seducer of the Queen and infamous. I swore you were her guardian, and her state Kept as a sword between you. Then their daggers Were brandished round me, half in chastisement, Scorning the scornful page: but one struck deep. O master, they have cleft my very heart, For I have seen what I will never bear An instant in my thoughts. ... their ribaldry Struck on my eyes. 'Twere best that you should slay me, WÃ­shing to stop my tongue, for you would stop My eyes from their remorse. Raoul. [To Anna.] Can you not learn The boy speaks truth? It gives me suffering Keener than any a soft youth can bear To see you derogate. Anna. Remove the boy; He raves delirious. Then, as you are knight, Return to me. Raoul. Have you not heard his mouth Proclaim your honour wounded?âfor he means Your honour all the while. You are abashed, Confess, you are abashed! And for a whim You lose your majesty. Anna. But I am deaf, Deaf of my very nature as a queen, Stone-deaf to slander. If Fernando dies I am indifferent: listeners of all kinds Are weak, are parasites. Remove the boy, If you would have him healed. Raoul. [Lifting Fernando.] Then bid farewell. Anna. You say you love him, you would have him live. If you would have me live, if presently You would not see me dead upon the ground, You must not ring farewell upon my lips; For when I say it, even as an echo, My heart grows frozen. Raoul. Ah, I know, I know. I have heard that before. Back to your castle, Say I offended you, but do not say You lured me to the woods. [Arrested by Anna.] How like a statue, With head just lifted to St. Vincent's Tower! In the strong spell her presence casts on me I cannot move. Such numbness! Lad, I fear We are enchanted by this stranger princess. I have no power to raise you. Fernando. [On his knees to Anna.] Senlis, Senlis! Lady, you face that tower: appeal to her, Our great protectress! Mother of our king, As you love France, and as you love my lord, Commend him to God's Mother; bid him go. Ave Maria! [Again he falls back.] Anna. [Clasping her hands.] But I cannot pray And loose and let him go! When he has left me, I shall be solitary in the wood And lone as a strayed child. [Fernando gives a piteous groan.] FarewellâFarewell! Dear Mother, of thy virtue I can speakâ Farewell! O instant miracle! Begone! Give me no answer. I have said farewell. [Raoul raises Fernando and carries him away; within sight, down the avenue he meets the Physician, consigns Fernando to him, and then plunges into the thickest part of the wood.] And now I need not watch him any more In the eddies of the storm. Ave Maria, Draw him back to me! Lo, he is struck dumb As Zacharias, helpless to believe The love I bear him. Thou didst raise me up To be a mother, and I reared that tower In gratitude: it was for France I prayed, For succour of a kingdom, not myself. ... But now, 'mid ruin of these autumn leaves, And wail and bitter chilling of the wind, I pray, O Mary, Queen of Miracle, For softness of the spring: my heart is hard, And love is hard; it is the long disuse, The falsehood, the suspicion; for I dreamed Of love as thou in lonely Nazareth, Mother, as fervently, with soul as bowed, With loyalty as pure: then custom came And wedded me, then fell the barren curse ... I walked a shadow 'mid these stately trees, Stricken and silenced by the great reproach, When one May morning by a little shrine I knelt with callous heart. In the new year A child was born, and touching the small limbs, And catching their small touches at my breast, I found sometimes that I was sighing on For days, as in my girlhood; and the joy Of finding that deep well-spring at my heart Bubbling afresh, reared for thee yonder shrine Men call me foundress of. O blessÃ¨d Virgin, Again my spirit died: I stood by death Indifferent, stood indifferent to the honour France sought to heap on me; and made escape To the dewy woods of Senlis. Pray for me: By Calvary, by all thou didst endure Being esteemed as others, till the Cross Opened the sluices of thy love, control My worship, give it patience. If thou hear'st This prayer of mine, I have no more to give; My riches will be torn from me; as poor As any peasant by a convent gate I shall approach thee. Thou wilt give me all Thy Seven Sorrows, we shall be together. Mother, my heart is breakingâpray for me! Why do I strain my eyes across the branches? How dare I look! It was too great a prayer. If once his voice should give me what his eyes Lit for me in their depths! [Re-enter Raoul.] Raoul. A labyrinth! I think this forest is a labyrinth With you for centre. I have tried all paths, And all conduct me here. Anna. It is Madonna ... Raoul. Her sorceryâit is! I know you all, Know her, your patron-temptress. AliÃ©nor Spent half her hours in an adulterer's bed, Half by our Lady's altar. ... Au revoir, You said, and glanced and sighed: so to your will I swiftly answer. Anna. I would speakâ Raoul. Of honour? Nay, we have done with that. Of what, my Queen, Would you discourse? Anna. Of love. Raoul. How natural! What better, when once honour is removed? What better? You have given hints enough, Have chosen me for the lone forest walk. Anna. In trust. Raoul. Reliance that my blood would fire; That is a woman's trust. You misconceive. If you could bear the truth, as with that swirl Of leaves and snapping branches in your face You bear the tempest, I would give you truth In skeleton. Oh, you are petty dreamers! You think you are the cause: but I will murmur Free against life, withholding from respect No mad ejaculation. Anna. I forgive, If you have been deceived. Raoul. How distant still You are, how mere a margin to my soul! Deceived! You thought me moodyâwithout question You were the cause; you found me sorrowful, And deemed I was ambitious of your favour, And dared not woo you. So you plagued me jealous, As any woman, Alix, AliÃ©nor. You found me timid. ... Madam, had I wished To add you to my other mistresses Success were easy. All that I attempt Is mine, first to enjoy, then fling away: At last success has daunted me. I climb Wave after crested waveâall that is left Is weariness of storm. This is the plague: To be so absolute and find no value, In anything I grasp. This AliÃ©nor, This wife I have at last divorced, this beauty, Has not deceived me; still her lustrous hair Is lustrous; yours will never match the shine. I have not been deceived, nor shall you pardon, You who have given matter of offence, Dishonouring your name. But there, we chatter, And the black rain is drenching us. To house! [Violently drawing her toward the tent.] I do not pardon you that you have changed My manners, made this possible. I told you That we must part; you would not, you refused To say farewell: then, by the Seven Virgins, Who spilt their lamps and perished in the dark, You shall become my mistress. Anna. I remain Under the cracking elms: it is my pleasure. You do not settle anything I am, Nor, by an inch, my action. Raoul. But they rock, The trees are rocking round you in the wind. Lady, the perilâ Anna. To your narrative! I gave you favour of an audience, I gave you leave to open the long years Of your long loneliness. We do not meet As children with clear faces ... but continue. I do not let ambassadors break off From record of their peril or adventure Encountered for my sake, for any passion The story sets aflame. This AliÃ©nor, Your wife, you say did not deceive you, though As wife she was unfaithful: you desired Simply the lustrous hair. It keeps its colour; And yet there is divorce. Raoul. I knew her wanton, Fickle and wanton when I married her: It was no shock to find her with her lovers; It was the shock to find myself a foolâ Anna. She lives. Raoul. To be forgotten and despised, And trampled under foot. I would have killed her, Believe me, had she ever owned my heart The way a wife may own. Anna. How meet it is That a light woman should be trodden down On the mire of the highways as a sodden leaf. Continue, Count. Why did you hesitate To fling her to the drift of destiny? Why treat her as your equal, and divorce? Raoul. Because ... My Queen, I may no longer speak, I dare not; I have shamed myself too far. You shall not learn. Anna. [Turning toward the tent.] The rain indeed is fierce; It is my pleasure now to seek the tent, My pleasure still to question you. Raoul. Then hear, Madonna, hear me. I shall seem to lieâ I am not worthy of your faith. You force me To speak, who am apostate, of my creed; To speak to you, whom my vile lips confounded An instant with my base desires, of love. Anna. It was of love that I desired to speak, Drawing you down the forest. BlessÃ¨d spot! For once I caught you singing on a sward, A little, secret greensward in the beeches, Blithe, of pure love. Raoul. You punish me. Anna. I heard: The creed we over-hear is seldom false. Take courage. Raoul. When I looked on you at Senlis, At whiles so sorrowful and then with mirth So simple and abounding, satisfied To win the approbation of a child, And share his pastimes, I could bear no longer A harlot in my house; I put her from me, Away, for ever, then with cleaner mind I travelled back to Senlis. Ah, my Queen! I am not pious; a rare benison At whiles in battle and at whiles in song Has rested on my soul: then I have wept, But secretly, for very joy, and risen In myself absolute. You blest me so; And save that now and then I trilled a snatch For very rapture in the secret wood, My love was hidden, stored up with the stars That are wiped out by day and unsuspected, That are not, soon as there are eyes to watch. I stood apart and let the minions serve, While youâinsufferable!âwith your favour, And torturing, light sallies, set me up A butt for all your shallow-hearted knights To jest at and to envy. You have made Matter for gossip of a mystery So fresh and awful 'tis as Chaos blabbed Of a world God had not shaped, that in His dreams He saw the tender dream of. O profane! Anna. [Laying her hand on his.] You stood apart and let the minions serve. Raoul. This is too hard. I had taken this caress A month ago as meekly as a sinner Christ stoops down from His crucifix to kiss. I cannot now. Through all my heart I search To know where you are leading me. My Queen, You are in no-wise; though the little hand Is laid on mine with accent of a Queen; You are no more my lady. By your words, Your gestures, your enticements to the forest, You galled my manhood to another name; And then, convicting me of infamy, Stood by and sentenced. Now you play the childâ I dash your hand away; you know it thrills As the death-lightning could not. Courtesan! But you have never loved! Anna. I am a novice, Withal a stranger. I have never loved Save in the woods of Senlis: all I know Of love is breathing it. I have no arts; But being by birth a queen, I laid my hand In yours as sign that I would be your wife. Raoul. [Kneeling.] O infinite, great heart, no more! Anna. Beloved! But now my tongue is loosed, and, as the birds Sing in the dripping sunshine, I must speak. Would you not say the spring was back again In the sharp green of the beeches? More persuasion Before the difficult, dark brows believe? May we not yet be lovers? Raoul. You forget You are the mother of a king. Anna. Your countess, Countess of CrÃ©py-Valois, and forgetful Of the long years before I heard your voice, Yea, as of very infancy. But yet I can recall the colour of your hair That morning in the sun, and your sheathed eyes. Raoul. Oh, hush! You dazzle me, you dream. Anna. So simply I chose you for my husband. Raoul. Anne of France, If you will marry me, it is more fast Than bondage to a throne. If you dare love me As I loved you and dared not, if ... but, stay! Anna. Oh, let me live! Raoul. The storms are on us, child, The winter close. Such handfast as I take, Drawing you down into my inmost soul There to abide, to be indeed its fellow, May tax you past your strength. No more illusion, No dreams before or after! We are ageing; It is not spring with us. We have no hopes, No goal but in each other, and, O love, Death is upon us. Anna. But before I dieâ Do you not see how there is urgent summer Under these drifted twigsâthe flashing moss, And curling of soft ivy-ends beneath The russet litter of the lily-leaves, See, if I push my foot? No more illusion, No dream that I have touched the quick of life Being a spouse or mother; no more dreams; Simply this keen reality of love. Raoul. Then with no vow, Then in the storm and to the bitter end, I take you for my own, I give myself Wholly to you. 'Tis but a gipsy hearth That we can kindle: all the summer woods Crackling before us for our warmth, and all Our comfort in the flame. O my Desire, This is but minstrel's talk, and you are flushing Through the deep pallor, kindled and in tears. Anna. Let me but listen, lie upon your breast And listen. I could never get your voice To give me of its kind, after its fashion, The treasure of your eyes. And now I see My own in them, and hear I am beloved! And I am glad 'tis for a little while. Already I could fall asleep, my own, Fall fast asleep on your deep, lulling words. [Starting.] I wake, if you are silent. Raoul. To the endâ And I am glad 'tis for a little while, Pressed in a little space, long as the woods Of Senlis shelter us, these flickering woodsâ Most sure of doom, abiding in its shadow As under raven plumage, we will love. Then fall the certain night. Anna. [Looking up devoutly.] And then the stars, Where our great love is stored. Raoul. Then fall the night Black-blooded on the world. You turn aside; Your lips are moving. Do you dare to pray While I bend down to kiss you? Anna. Yea, my lord, With a full heart of gratitude to Mary, My Queen and Patroness, who heard my prayers, And drew you to my feet. Raoul. It was the tremor Of your lips that would not settle to farewell Started me restless on the forest path; And the bared oak disclosed you. Like a Dryad You leant and whispered. Little liar, at heart You whispered I should come, and Nature gave you Of her own magic back. Anna. It was Madonna. Raoul. The low, indomitable voice. A rival, Dearest, a challenge! You must love me all: I cannot spare a sigh. Anna. But you mistake. To play sweet music we must catch a lyre, And we must love with Love. That is religion! The restâthe silence, what we cannot say, She builds beside us in great chords. Beloved, You must not miss them. Raoul. âMust not miss your face. I will have all the ardour of your eyes, All you present to heaven. I give you all Of Heaven and Earth and Hell that's wrought in me, With a great jealousy. You would exclude And harbour for our Lady the reproaches, The chiding fondness, the soft providence You call your prayers. You shall not. Very woman Of very woman, you shall give me all. My sole concession is a priestâyour pleasure In that shall be performed: but seven knights, Secret and sworn, shall witness our espousals; You shall be deeply sealed my own. Anna. [Kissing him.] My world, My light, my kingdom! Raoul. You are weeping, child. Henceforth confession is to me. Anna. How soon I shall win absolution! O my lord, These are a lover's tears. I feel that parting Is nigh at hand; and I am superstitious; I cannot see you pass into the wood Out of my sight again. Raoul. My bride, my bride! Anna. And yet I must; but you will come to-morrow, Bear me away for ever. Raoul. You are mine. To-morrow! Oh, how light your speech! Our nuptials Must be to-night: to-morrow there will be A past indeed, there will be reminiscence! You will forget that you have been a queen, Mother of kings; you will forget your prayers. An instant and we ride. [He dashes down the central glade.] Anna. Come to me quickly; I dare not be without you, not alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene.âThe courtyard of Anna's Hunting Lodge at Senlis: in the midst there is a fountain with a stone basin, and on the left a little oratory to the Virgin. The woods lie brown and red on the horizon, and the Tower of St. Vincent is full in sight. Anna, attired for the chase; Fernando. Anna. Fernando, how uneasily You move about! You are impetuous And yet forgetful, an uncertain page. Fernando. My pardon. Anna. And the jesses? Have you served Your lord so long, and dare to tax his patience? I dare not, and I will not. Once again In the woods of Senlis, and so fine a morning ... Fetch me my hood. Fernando. The Count is busy, madam, With the Archbishop. Anna. Child, how plain it is You never have served royalty. A Queen Commands Archbishops. Put me on my hood. Fernando. But I have seen my lord. Ah, had you seen him In the last anger when his will is braved, You would not hope to ride down to the forest. Madam, my lord will never hunt again. [He buries his face in his hands, sobbing.] Anna. Ah, now I see you have ill news to break. The Count is killed? Fernando, speak! You love him. I am almost jealous of the way you love. Be merciful; for if you do not speak I must indeed believe that he is dead, Or in the grip of some calamity That holds him alien as death. Fernando. 'Tis so, 'Tis that: my lord is doomed. Anna. By whomâto what? How doomed? He lives, and he is well beloved; His power is absolute. Fernando. Will you blaspheme? God loved him; all his power he had from God. I looked into his secret when one day I loosed his visor on the battle-field. As I held up the crucifix he smiled; There was his power: and now he is cut off And now ... Oh, horror! If you loved my wayâ I know you cannotâif indeed you loved Through circumstance, without one curbing fear, Down to the very soul, you would burn up Those Senlis woods where you have tempted him, Burn them to ash behind you. Anna. The event? Fernando. My master follows quickly. Oh, prepare To face and overcome him. The Archbishop Fronts him unmoved; but in his violence My lord is in ascendant, as a wave Dashed up against a rock and shattered by it Seems in the crash to shatter. Do not meet him. Flee! The Archbishop brings with him the curse Of excommunication from the Pope, If instantly you do not yield your place Beside him to the Countess AliÃ©nor. Lady, you cannot stay to bring despair And infinite staining sorrow ... Anna. You mistake. I love your way, could burn these pleasant woods, And evenâyes, I could cast down that tower, Raised, as it were by my own hands, to save My lord from any staining grief: all sorrow I lighten and remove. But to your story! No menaces, the facts! Where is this vile, Repudiated woman? Fernando. At the doors. Anna. Not here, not in the woods. I shall not see her? ... If once her footsteps ... Oh, my dewy woods! Where is her lodging? Fernando. Madam, in the convent. Anna. My convent? Fernando. Under the Archbishop's charge She waits for your submission. Anna. While my lord Chafes like an angry billow on the rock. Oh, let him come to me! Fernando. You are related Unlawfully, within the sixth degree: 'Tis so affirmed at Rome. You cannot wed: You never have been wedded to my lord. Therefore, O lady ... Anna. Shall you cease to serve him When he is outcast, or remain his page? Tell me, Fernando! Fernando. I!âmy life is his. If I might wait on him to dip my finger In a clear fount and cool his tongue in hell I should be happy; so a page attends. Anna. I am glad you love my lord; I will not boast. [Enter at a distance Raoul and Gervais.] Look up, Fernando! He is coming towards us; Draw back my hood. He is the goodliest manâ How the sun strikes him down the avenue!â The goodliest man that I have ever seen. [She curtseys to Raoul, and bows with stateliness to Gervais.] Good-morrow, sir. Raoul. Archbishop, to your work! You see this lady, this fair Dian, this Blond majesty, apparent as the sun In the arched heavensâencounter her pure face, And read her the new titles that the Pope Salutes her with. Gervais. Madam, our Holy Father, Declares Dame AliÃ©nor the lawful wife Of the Count of Valois, and pronounces you, His leman, guilty, were our lord not bound By honourable marriage, of incest, Being so near in kin. Raoul. You hear the titles, Incestuous, adulterous, my whore, That the Church gives you. Anna. You have hailed me Dian; I am whatever name you call me by, All that you find me; since to-day your goddess, I must command you to attend the chase. Put on your hunting-gear. I am surprised That you should waste an hour of this fair day Listening to slander. History must flow The way we will who are current of the stream. My lord, there is dispute among your grooms Which horse you chooseâthat is the only matter Of moment to decide. Determine that, I promise you a day in the woods of Senlis As full of chequered sunshine and of joy As autumn's golden leaves and the gold heart Of a Queen can make it. Raoul. [Putting his arm round her and turning defiantly to Gervais.] Say, my lord of Rheims, Are you not envious? These are woodland sports, And this a heathen deity. O France, And Russia's royal daughter, evermore Queen to the furthest inch of my dominion, Let the mute Church stand by us like a tomb! Henceforth our comfort must be in ourselves, The creatures that we are, the love we love, And those deep wells we draw from for our life, Our bosoms' captive founts. There shall be triumph Within the magic kingdom where we rule As in deep faerÃ¯e; yea, our fearful vassals Shall slowly serve us, looking toward the sky; While our brave knights proffer their souls as simply As their lives in war, and all our noble youth Follows our fervid doings as religion, Dinning our ears with fables and new verse. My lord of Rheims, our future! You would damn me, Would brand a harlot's brand across her forehead Who stands there so august in the trembling dew, And bids me follow her. You found the words To charge her with; you made her understand She has no innocence! You trailed your slime Across my rose to canker it. You devil, I will defend my love. See, in your sight I kiss her. It is thus that lovers love, And thus and thus, and in the woods is Eden. My sovereign and my mistress. Anna. [Disengaging herself.] Do my pleasure. Dearest, I ever love you in the woods, And I have much to pardon. Raoul. I return To a long revelry Of laughter and forgiveness. [Exit.] Anna. [To Fernando.] Do not follow, Fernando ... there is water in that fount; Fill me a cup. I thank you. Now, Archbishop, Your worst of tidings. You have sentence there Of excommunication on the Count. Read the provisions. Gervais. As abhorred of God, To be abhorred of all on earth who covet Their own salvation: to be deemed as refuse Of an infecting stench: to be denied Our Saviour's body and His mother's prayersâ That is the sentence and the doom. Anna. [Rocking to and fro.] You read! You sentence! Those who sit on royal thrones, I know it, when they hear such sentences Put justice by. The leniency of kings Flows as sweet honey from the rock. I will not, I cannot think this doom will come to pass. Gervais. I read the doom, but you have written it, And can revoke it: if you have indeed This piteous, royal heart you make your boast, You must revoke it. I appeal to you As our most sovereign lady, Queen of France, Fall not so low as to condemn a subject, And one withal the noblest of our realm, To such humiliation as the Church Heaps on the disobedient. Think a little How he will suffer, being no vacant churl, But the very pith of men, a soldier bound By oath and by investiture to God, When outcast from all noble war, from glory, From fellowship in arms and from restraint Of knighthood's order. Scornful, absolute, You know him: you will see the merest hind Question his will and laugh at him unserved. Anna. His wife, his household, and there is Fernando. We shall attend our lord. Gervais. O callous woman, Have you no pity? Reinstate his wife, The noble lady you have wronged, who loves him, And who has travelled in great jeopardy To Rome for leave but to reclaim his love. Have you no pity? Anna. But there is Fernando Indisputably hisâI speak of him. My lord will not be comfortless. Gervais. Then still You hold by your harsh sentence and take hands With the apostate as his paramour? Anna. The way is very long to Rome. She travelled, You say, at peril of her life, and under The shadow of Count Raoul's wrath, and simply For leave to love him ... that was wanton's love! Gervais. Then you must prove your own of other sort, Of nobler scope. I listen. [Anna is silent.] When defiant Of the Church's punishment you promised pleasure To the adulterer, what change was wrought Of honour to his spirit? He at once Addressed you as a heathen deity, And half unclasped the buckles of your belt, Dragging you to him. If your lustfulness ... Fernando. [On his knees before the Archbishop.] Madonnaâpardon!âfrom the heart of God Madonna loves my lord! Gervais. If lustfulness So riots in your blood, to gratify Your senses you can cast away religion, Cut off your lover from his chivalry, From all fair service of his God, from honour, And from the worship of your womanhood, How stands your love? Anna. I shall prevail with him. Gervais. Ay, to his ruin. Madam, by whose power Have you prevailed? You were a barren woman, Worthless to France, and through the murmuring crowd And past your silent husband I have watched you Walk with unguided feet. Look to that tower; You raised itâit is adverse to you now As citadel of your arch-enemy. You may not pray, you must not pray for him; You have locked every door against his God, The saints, his guardian angelâshut him up, Not with himself, with you. How stands your love? Anna. Fetch AliÃ©nor ... [With a gesture of blessing Gervais leaves her.] How grim it is and cold Before the little shrine. O Virgin Mother, Is it the Judgment Day? Thou must not plead, Nor offer intercession any more, Thou must not, for the damned. O welling heart. And I have checked thee at thy privilege, Thy function, thy delight! Thou must not pray ... Then thou art no more woman but a stone. Ave Maria! She does not catch the words, She does not hear me. I must give him back Myself to the dear earth, back to his God, The saints, his guardian angel. [A horn-call.] Do I hear His horn blown toward the woods? We were to hunt; But I have sent for AliÃ©norâthat deed Can never be revoked. I have no courage To ask him for my soul, nor any voice To bid him curse me from his side. But Love ... If he extort the answer of my lips ... Though it were madness ... I must speak of Love. It is my only theme. [Another horn-call.] Again his note! And I must take it as the general call, The wide, indifferent summons to the dead. [She averts her face, fixing it on the image of the Virgin.] [Re-enter Raoul.] Raoul. Anna, my love! Fernando. [Advancing from the distance.] Yonder our lady prays Dear lord, disturb her not. Raoul. But, by St. Hubert, Except the vision of a crucifix Arise between the antlers of a stag, We will not be arrested in our sport To-day, we are so reckless. Come, my sweet; It is your pleasure I attend the chase, Mine that you mount. Your hand! [Perceiving a change in Anna.] A plague on you! What trick is this? [To Squires who are leading in horses.] The Countess is afraid Of something in the air; withdraw a little. [They retire.] I dissipate all humours. Well, my free, Unclouded huntress, what is my offence? You have so much to pardon in the woodsâ Then to the woods that you may pardon it! And I may take revenge that you receive me With lids bent on the ground and pallor spreading A veritable darkness on your face. Dearest, you turn; you lay your hands on me, Your eyes have lost their speech! What troubles you? What change is come? Anna. I love you. Raoul. Can I doubt! I do not doubt it. Through the fallen leaves, And through the tempest ... and you will not blench; You will not tremble to be made accurst, To travel any whither that I wend, So fast you love me. Am I learning this, Sweet, from your face? There is so much to pardon, And yet ... Anna. I love you. Raoul. Ah, too passionate The little, piercing cry, too like farewell. Kiss me and pardon. This warm breath is all I ask in life. Softly! Again your lips! Is it my soul your soul is trembling for In this soft bosom? Speak! Is it the future, With all the bells rung backward and the churches Fast as the portals of a town at siege, That strikes you faithless? You have chosen me In the hour of my setting sun. There is no creature So solitary as the setting sun; That should have warned me: I have watched him sink Far from the orchards, the warm poplar plains, Into the chill and sorrow of the earth Plumb as a drowning mortal. So you leave me? You can? There is no courage in your joy! No memory in your love! We two together Have climbed the light and plumbed the deeps of fire That flow through springtide to the months of gold And kindle every altar. Are you blind To the bright utterness of how we loved, Blind, blind, as you are dumb? If you keep silence, Our love is incest, is adultery; The Church brands naked truth on us. Oh come! You will not? Is it that the Church forbids? No, if I take you at your cuckoo-note, Your chime and iteration, 'tis your love. Anna, a love that proffers stones and thorns And wormwood for the generous Trinity, Roses and bread and wine ... Away with it; It is the very leavings of the priest, Who has prevailed with you so easily To count yourself no wife. A hundred lovers Could not have severed us as this Archbishop With his most sacred gallantry. Your husband Doffs to his triumph. Ah, your bosom heaves, You tremble at the falsehood ... Yet you leave me. You can? And for what flaw? Arraign our marriage. Anna. I doâlook there! [Re-enter Gervais, with AliÃ©nor at a distance.] I ordered this to pass. And now you must not speak again: the Archbishop Will lead me to my convent. Raoul. O my God! Anne, are you mad? You do not see herâsnake And temptress and invincible. She walks Along as simply as a pestilence; A cloud of locusts settling on the fields Is not more impudently sure. You order That this should come to pass? Oh, then for orgies In your chaste sight; the Archbishop to restore her Safe to my arms, and you to bear the smart Of our conjugal embraces. [Seizing her hand.] Anna, say, One instant, is it veritably you Who will this? Anna. As I love you. Raoul. There's a flaw! You love and love me, and yet presently You dig my grave. Look at that lissome beautyâ She loves indeed, and as a creature's cunning Goes to obtain its food, she lies in wait To feed her appetites. A penitent, And you the spangled huntress! [Gervais and AliÃ©nor are now close.] [To AliÃ©nor.] Ah, my snake, After a little season you return. [Pointing to Anna.] Archbishop, this your charge! AliÃ©nor. Who is this lady On whom you turn your back? Raoul. The Queen of France. AliÃ©nor. You ever loved lithe women, and this statue Has the ample breasts of Caritas, the age, And the honest, noble grace. Your Countess, sir? Let me salute her. Raoul. Ask her what she is; She knows her titles; she will answer simply From the very heart of truth. AliÃ©nor. Lady, your name, Your dignities? I am Count Raoul's wife. Anna. And I his paramour. Raoul. [Apart, as the women face each other.] A scorpion whip To her tender innocence. What white and red, Flushing the cheek that feels its nakedness! These are the cheeks for a nun's bands and hood, Or for a husband's lips. Gervais. [To Raoul.] I intervene: This lady is indeed my charge. Her penance Must be to stand apart and see you humbled And yet exalted as I draw you back To the life of innocence. I bid you kneel To your sore-injured consort, bid you bow In deep submission to the Holy Church, And on your knees in penitence and shame Re-knit your contract. [To AliÃ©nor.] Lady, to your place. Raoul. [Repulsing AliÃ©nor.] Not at my side. I will make no more contracts With any woman. I have cast her off For ever as my wife. Is this the lady That once besieged St. Anthony's hot sleep, A pretty temptress, with her silver eyes And clumps of frizzled hair, one of those devils The Church breeds secretly? I have no wife, And therefore am more open to assault. Gervais. Cease from profanity. It is her will Whom you affect to honour that at once You should restore this woman to her rights: She makes and she exacts the sacrifice. Anna. I make and I exact ... Raoul. You bring me wills, Wills of another, pleasure of a woman, Threats of that subtle courtesan, the Church; You bring me lettersâthis or this shall happen, Or else ... But bastard William took his will On Britain, with the lusty Normans, else King Harold had not rotted on the beach. I put this woman from me as my wife. Take her to convent, if you will, or else ... Gervais. My lord, you are an ageing man, near death; Think of your soul. Raoul. My soulâthe hasty flower Sprung on life's battlefield! Gervais. I say your soul. Think of your sins. Raoul. Name me my enemy Or yours, name any dragon I can fight, And we will brood upon his funeral. Name any action that is perilous, Ay, to my soulâthe soul, too, loves adventureâ I will not spare my soul. [With a glance at AliÃ©nor.] How spend the days 'Twixt now and the sudden fire? A boon-companion This lady may remain, if she elect To wake the recollection in my flesh Of the seven deadly sinsâof idleness, Concupiscence ... You smile! Say, AliÃ©nor, You who have many lovers, am I one? And will you be content to spend your days Under my roof, my mistress? Gervais. Do not scruple, Lady, to take this offer. You are blest, Your union sanctified; you are a wife, Knit to your husband as the Church to Christ, And if he plant you in his home ... AliÃ©nor. [To Raoul.] My lord, I have so many loversâyou are one, And if the only one! ... But I am faint; I travelled for you all the way to Rome, Since the way backward to your breast lay so. But I am faint, a pilgrim at the goal, Half swooning. Can you give me wine? Anna. Fernando, Show this great lady hospitality. AliÃ©nor. Not from your hands; I will not touch his bread Or drink his wine from you. [Fernando brings a goblet and flask. Raoul fills the goblet, and offers it.] Ah, thanks, my lord. Now I revive a little. And a kiss. That is a drop from the wine-blood of your heart! Raoul, you know the remedy. 'Tis good To plunge my hands deep in this bushy hair, To play with you: but when my strength returns I will remember your offence, avenge it Love's awful way, with wilder vehemence, Venus accoutred as a very Mars. You shall not be my husband any more; I will not share the name ... I am content To have no name but woman, no credentials But youth and beauty, no desire but love, Your love, my lord: not Gosport's and not Hugo's. I have forgotten them as this fair dame Forgets her youth, it is so long ago. But seeâthe Father blushes. Surely now We may dismiss him with his penitent Waiting to say farewell. Raoul, you choose: I am content to be your paramour, But not to see those eyes in solitude, As I have seen them since they learnt the way To the woods of Senlis. Those fierce, raven eyes, Sighting their prey so far, preoccupied! Oh, that is absence! Raoul, you dismiss her Now on the instant, or I take my place At the Archbishop's side. Anna. [Advancing to Raoul.] I would not rate My love against another's, and the way Is very far to Rome. She loves you so, To a great journey's end, a mighty love. Almost I tremble; but there is a measure She cannot mete: she cannot give her soul To be your soul. Raoul. Anna! Anna. I do not speak Of her; there is no other when I speak, And no comparison. [Going up to her horse and patting him.] Be kind to Senlac. I shall not ride again; but you will ride Senlac, my palfrey. Raoul. And caparisoned For you! Be my companion down my woods, Give me my golden day, or I will lift This gaudy beauty to your seat. Anna. Fernando, Take Senlac for your own, a parting gift. [To Raoul.] I will leave nothing with you for misuse. Raoul. Where will you goâto Court? Why do I ask? You pass from out my life; that is enough. You are a Queen. Anna. I am a Russian Princess: We all are buried in our native land Wherever we may die: from very far I came, and I shall pass. Raoul. Barbarian, Howl in your steppes! This mystery in woman Is but the savage in them puzzles us: A Scythian, a creature that is wolf, Then bitch that licks your hand, thenâ Anna. I remember So little of my language; but this French ... God keep it from my ears! [Repulsing Gervais, who approaches.] No, no, Archbishop: No guidanceâand no error! [Exit.] Raoul. She is gone. [To AliÃ©nor.] You think I do not see you, what you are, You spotted toad. [To Gervais.] You think that I submit! For me there is no Church, no wife, no God. I brave all curses and I snap all ties. Go! Gervais. But my blessing rest with you, my son. Rebellious in your words, by deed you render Obedience to the Church. Raoul. [Flinging AliÃ©nor toward the Archbishop.] Away with him, Pass with him, an adultress with the priest. AliÃ©nor. I will not. Raoul, once you flung me down Into the Seine, and I swam back to you, And then ... I will not leave you for a name. I love you carnallyâwith stronger colours Now I have felt your force. I love your curses, Your blows and curses. You shall never live The cramped life of a monk, my libertine. Take me, your leman. Raoul. So my Countess wills, And so the Church approves and I comply. Obedientâah, to whom? Fling wide the doors! [He shouts to the Pages and Women who have gathered round the courtyard to watch.] We will keep open revel in the sight Of the Archbishop. Pages, choose your own, Choose from the Queen's bower-maidens; ask no leave, But take your will and riot, this fair lady, Queen of the revels. Dance! [A minstrel strikes up a measure. While they dance the courtyard darkens, and lightning zig-zags among the dancers.] AliÃ©nor. [As, borne along in the dance, she passes Gervais.] Father, your blessing, for I am a wife. Pages and Bower-Maidens. Father, your blessing, for she is a wife. Raoul. Father, your blessing on my paramour. Gervais. May heaven direct the lightning! You blaspheme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene.âSenlis. A cold evening of mid-November; the withered garden of St. Vincent's Abbey. To the left a vine arcade. At the back the tower of the chapel rises against the sky, while more to the left the hospice and portress' lodge flank the convent gate. An old nun is planting pansies in front. Anna's voice is heard through the vine leaves. Anna. O crimson trellis of my vine ... O my arcade, With flowers all fragrance and with fruit all stain, The freedom and the laughter of your leaves, My prison-bower, preserve me. Not to church! I turn away from the dusk sisterhood To the garden-alley and the glinting stars; And here I'll pace, Watching the Sisters as they pass along From the apple-trees and vineyards to the rest I have appointed them. [To SÅur Eulalie.] You love these flowers? SÅur Eulalie. O lady, yes, a little; one must have Something to love, a little. BlessÃ¨d Jesus Remembers how I gave my youth to Him, How I am His. I have no grief at all; And it is pleasant, stepping on the grass, To plant the heart's-ease. When it blooms next year I may be in my grave. Anna. Your hope, my sister, For springtide; I will put it in my prayers. And my tall Lucia? Busy with her knife High in the pear-tree! She is coming down, Nor turns to count the poplars on the verge, Seven twinkling trees, nor scans the forest wall. SÅur, you are set at vantage. Does the sun Burn low across the fields? SÅur Lucia. A bitter night, Dreary for snow-fall; but I must not glance Away on to temptation. 'Tis the rule We keep our eyes fixed on St. Vincent's Tower While we are pruning. Here and there a light Flares from the city windows through the boughs. I must descend. [She gathers up her tools, her lopped branches, and disappears.] Anna. She passes as a phantom Beneath the tower. It stands there of my will; It is myself, my image, and the mill-stone That I have hung about my lover's neck. Oh, hateful! And I dare not climb its stairs And look abroad. ... These rules! And I am foundress Of this blind life. [A lay sister opens the gate and passes through it.] Breath from my dewy woods! O Senlis, Senlis! It is shut again, Closing me in, a captive. Love, beloved, My sacrifice to thee! Thou hast the world, The forest, freedom. Oh, to hear his note! Why are the glades so silent? In the spring, When first I was immured, my consolation, My joy was the reveillÃ©. April ended, I caught no more his plunges in the green, His onslaught on the boar; the chase was done, And it was stifling summer. Raoul, Raoul, Blow me a bugle-note, the silver horn Our lips have clung to, give me salutation, Ride down your aspen-coverts, ride alone, And I am happy. It is said to-morrow They muster at Lallard ... I cannot sleep, Not with this hope. But I will pace my vineyard And watch the light unfurl and waitâO music!â The stir and faÃ«ry traffic of my woods. [The bells of the Tower clang.] Those bells! I know that they will drive me mad. They are the voice of madness, summoning The crowd to a great hollow and a vault Where dead men play at life's solemnities, Where all is mockery and cuckoo-note, Cackle and brazen tongue. How different From the deep pleasures of my girding woods, That touch one with a sunbeam, a blown leaf, Or a petal down the wind. They break again, Hurling my soul down to the precipice And crater of a void. To keep my wits, To rouse some human echo! [Pausing by SÅur Eulalie.] Sister, drop The roots of heart's-ease ... Help me! SÅur Eulalie. Ah, what help From one infirm, great lady? Anna. I have heard The tale of your young days, of how you loved A lawless bandit; how he loved you well, And sought you as his dearest. You are lone. Say, was it good to leave him? SÅur Eulalie. It was good. He died upon the gibbet afterward, And asked my prayers because I was a nun, The one thing holy he had ever known, He said, poor, foolish FranÃ§ois. It was good. If I had given him kisses at his will, Stolen from another, he had never asked Those prayers unceasing that will never cease Till Mary, the most pure, most pitiful And holy Queen receive my dying breath. You have surprised me, lady ... It is years Beyond all count since I have said his name, Jesu, forgive me! And it all is strange, I am so old and weak. The snow will fall To-morrow; I must plant the pansy-roots Before the snow ... All strange! [Turning, she looks at Anna.] My dear, your face! Anna. You know my tale ... Ah, well! Say, is it good? SÅur Eulalie. It is, my Queen. The plants shall lie about, And I will reason with you. Though we hear Stories to make us shiver of the deeds Our Count and his abandoned wife commit, Yet think ... My FranÃ§ois murdered, stole, blasphemed, Before he sought my prayers to save his soul; Then, Heaven be praised, he sought them. Anna. [Low, as to herself.] But for me, I am discouraged to the very bone. I reared this tower, I gave these silver bells, Yet now am stricken helpless as I pace Through the long hours of prayer aloof from all This life that I have moulded, from this worship That is grown deaf and dumb to me. SÅur Eulalie. Alas! For his sake who may need you at the end, Take all this pain as part of every day, The yarn of patience. I have fared as you, Stone-dead to all our sacred mysteries: It is a sickness; slowly it will pass, And leave you heart's-ease. Anna. I have wept for joy, Meting the measure of my mighty love By absolute surrender. Now I freeze; I am discouraged to the very bone, I have no living strength ... The ice, the snow? SÅur Eulalie. But after that, after the ice and snow? Anna. Listen! I must confess to these old eyes, And their forgiveness: when I turn to hope, I pray that she may die ... To think she kneels At the little oratory where I prayed Each morning for him; but she does not pray, She will not there usurp my place. At feasts She will be mistress, but she is not Queen ... [With sudden burst of passion.] How deeply Raoul bowed before he took His seat beside me, how he called me France And Russia's royal daughter! Even at feasts I may not match her beauty; but I feel She will mingle with the lights and not transcend, Will seem part of the music, not a voice The music must grow soft to listen to; 'Twas so he praised me, so he found my beauty. And in the winter evenings when together We looked forth on the country and the sun, Or when I waited for him by the gates! Does she do that? O God, that she were dead! SÅur Eulalie. Hush you must pray for him, and for yourself, And then for all your enemies. But hush! We agÃ¨d ones can pardon: out of mind We keep these faded angers of the past, These troubles, but we knew them once ... So strange! Well, I must put the pansy-roots together, And bury them in heaps against the snow. And you will pray for all your enemies, That is enough, for him and for yourself. Saints, it is freezing! Anna. Let me have your trowel, Your roots, and end your toil. You shake with cold, And we shall lose you long before the spring, A very loss. SÅur Eulalie. Heaven bless you! Sovereign lady, What charity! I pressed into the soil So many fevers and deceiving dreams, And sore rebellions, that I yield my task With less reluctance that its exercise May bring you peace! Adieu! [Exit SÅur Eulalie.] Anna. So weak and old And ineffectualâa gentleness That makes the ice within me crash and moan, And yet how lovely! 'Tis in winter-time Of drear November that the heart's-ease plants Are bedded: so she tore them each from each, And set a bare root in a lonesome earth ... How the snow gathers, one dead thunderstorm In ghostly wrappings, with no voice, no fire: And day is dying. I must fetch a lantern Or I shall work benighted. [She goes to the portress' lodge, enters and returns with an unlit lantern. Suddenly she becomes aware that a man has entered the gate.] Who is this? Who comes? I must return to Cecily. Who comes? The ivy rocks above the gate. Who comes? Why should I falter? Destiny Happens perforce: it happens. [Anna and Raoul cross each other's path.] Raoul. What are you, Crossing my pathway, like a ghost? Anna. You come? Raoul. To search this convent. AliÃ©nor, my wife, Is here in hiding. I am come to kill her. Say where she hides. Anna. I cannot. Raoul. By all saints, You are a hypocrite. I shall discover My victim in your bleating flock. [He passes on.] Anna. I think, Oh, I believe he does not know my voice; He passes on beyond meâ To what deed? To one most righteous, one that long ago He should have wrought. But is it possible That she abides here? Ah, I recollect ... I have the clew!âMy lord! Raoul. [Turning.] And who are you? Your name, your purpose? [Coming close to her.] Well, my crystal flower, What is the part you play? Are you a Queen, My Countess, or a little temptress nun? Give me the word. Anna. Who am Iâdear, my lord, Your handmaid if you come, wronged in your honour, To punish treason. I will lead the way. But first a light ... [Stooping to kindle the lantern.] This evening in the dark A woman crept along; the chapel door Received her; but I have not seen her face. [Looking toward the chapel.] How dark and shut! She sleeps, if she is sleeping, in a tomb ... If she is sleeping. Raoul. Is the chapel locked? But you have entry. Give me up the key. Anna. [Giving it.] Then waken her. To slay one in one's sleep Is like a murder. Raoul. Anna, you are cold, These hands are far more icy than the keys ... Some wrath is in your heart. Anna. O love, beloved, That she could so betray you! Take the light; Swift to your vengeance! Raoul. Guide me to the door ... There is the siren in your voice, I falter ... Say, Annaâwe are lovers, it is dark, And if I have your love that is revenge, The sweetest to my lips. Anna. Go, strike her dead. It is my swift command. Betwixt us twain There is no secret moment while she lives. Strike swiftly, for I perish. Raoul. But lead on; It was your promise. Anna. I will look no more Upon her face, or dead or living. Strike, With an open-dealing justice. [She turns with the lantern away.] Raoul. And no light, Your will, but shifting Luna. [He disappears in the gloom.] Anna. I would pray ... [Facing the tower.] How still and awful! I could wish the bells Would jangle on my ear: through the open turret Two stars at gaze, but no sharp monitor. And there is peril; treason moves about Somewhere, though indistinct. Some wrong is done That the wide stream of starlight warns me of. What is it? [She remains looking steadily up.] Raoul. [Returning.] But the door is barred within ... I cannot enter. Quick, take up the lantern And light me to my work. You will not come? O devil, you would have me shed her blood, And yet you dare not see it flow. Intrepid Your voice rang at the door; there was a moment I thought you mine, felt I was absolute In your soul's bosom, where you keep your God. Do you not see, I have no other place, No other life, no manhood ... You are dazed, Staring at that high belfry. Off again! An instant, you have lost the scent, poor Lulla! What puts a woman off the scent of life Like this religion! [Catching her wrist.] But you shall not damn me A second time with your uncertain strength And eddying virtue. Come, take up the lantern, And tremble to the doorway. [She holds the light steadily, looks in his face, and stretches her arm as a barrier between him and the chapel.] Anna. Count of Valois, No further! I am taken unawares In a great sin. That woman is my foe, I am thirsting for her death ... We may not touch her: She is in sanctuary. Raoul. But I am come, An angel sent to carry her to hell; She is misplaced among the just, and if You would escape damnation with the damned, Light me to fling her down the great abyss. Unbar your arms. Anna. She rests beneath my roof, The tower I raised, and, as I am a Queen, Her life shall be untouched. Raoul. Fool, as her husband I come. You knit us up in holy bonds. She is mine, as I am hers: you interpose, You! Anna. She is safe. Raoul. But do not turn your eyes From mine to the splash of blood upon my cloak. That is Count Gosport's blood, to me as water, Pale water, till I mix it with the wine She mixed it with ... Anna, I took her back To my heart and bosom; it was your command; And there was feast and revel with such licence, There in the halls that you had trod, I thundered A curse on the foul hospitality, And rode forth to revenge some ancient spite. When I returned, too sudden for a welcome, Too sudden for deceit, Count Gosport held My place as host. I saw his feeble smile Fall under in the crash of his head at swing Of my hurled axe: and AliÃ©nor was gone. Now will you stay me? Pick me up the lantern, For I will take this business on myself, And force it to an end. [Pressing close to Anna, and then pausing as if to question her.] Is there some magic That dazzles me? You put me to this shame? You cannot understand, I have no honour While she is living. Anna. She must live. Raoul. [Clashing his sword down before her.] Then so, Forever this betwixt us. Have your way, Take her yourself; plant to the whirlwind, scatter To the untempered wind, while destiny Appoints her seasons. Have in all your will. I would not wrangle with you. Anna. You are dying! Give me the moment; do not think of her. Raoul. Aye, I am dying; and it is the blow You deal is fatal to me, not my wound: That was a rival's scratch. It is your hand, Love, yours that strikes me down. O Anna, Anna, It is your hand; but I will think of her, Give her the moment. When she comes to die Lay my fair wife before the altar-stone, Leave her a place beside me. Tombs and tombs, Why, you are building them all round, for each Eternal separation. ... [Staggering.] If you wish My bones should rest here, since there is no ban, They can be brought, and dust shall minister To dustâyour marriage! [Suddenly the chapel-door is unbarred and AliÃ©nor enters.] AliÃ©nor. Ah, the clang of steel As you can ring it! So, an instant back I heard the summons. I am here, my lord. Take all your pleasure with me, Raoul, husband, Give me your vengeance; give me anything, Yourself, with your own hand. I hid from you While you were slaying in a general heat, As on a battlefield: but kill me now, Beneath the stars, as you had kissed me first, As we had sprung together. Be it, Raoul, My lover, my own goodly, jealous love Who strikes me down. Let the black eyes consume Their love in flames before my fading sight, If you would punish me. ... Then take her home, Then worship her and call her by the names She prizes and I loatheâof spouse and wife. I give her all the years. But mine, be mine One little moment. Utterly I yield, Most utterly, to all your willâOne moment Of jealousy in action! I am wanton, Give me my wages, enter me as Death, So you take sure possession, so for ever You have me in your grasp. You will not speak! My chafing monster, you are grim for blood; I know that clench of the hand. Is Gosport slain? Raoul. With all his retinue. AliÃ©nor. [To Anna.] Fair lady, see, What rage I kindle. Can you light such rage? Raoul, my dearest, and you sighed for her Against my pillows, so you drove me on To speak of love to loversâHugo, Gosport; You have not taken vengeance slaying them, I grudge no mortal as your prey. Pursue, Track what you will, my bloodhound: keep the scent. That is desire. [She stretches herself on the ground before him.] Raoul. [Seizing her and dragging her toward Anna.] You hold me to my oath? Anna. [Her foot on his sword.] You shall not slay her. Raoul. So you will not stop This devil hissing in my maddened ears; You will not; something holds you backâyou love! Oh, for the love you gave me those three days By the deep pools of the forest. Gipsy Queen, Have you forgotten them? Anna. My royalties Are not forgotten. AliÃ©nor. Ah, you see, a saint, Cold and invincible. She has your worship! You, the blasphemer, stand here with your sword At foot of a Madonna. Why, our Lady Of Chartres, with the round, black ball of a head Is not a whit less comely. Take the cowl, Be monk, and play at loving on your knees. Raoul. I do, I will. [Kneeling by his sword.] Blackhooded and deform As the dwarfish Druid idol of the wood, You are the thing I long for, and this doom You put me to of turning back my feet From you, from these rejecting, sorrowful Wide eyes, and from the little, lonely mouth, Is more and worse to me than any shame This wanton purports. And you give no sign, No token of farewell. I cannot see you, Not as I would: I see the bands, the veil. Lift up the lantern, let it light your face; I would remember that. [He rises and looks into her face.] The trees are grown Around the castle. I would know your will Concerning the great plane-tree in the Court? You thought it hid St. Vincent's. Cut it down, I say; but answer! I am passing, child, Forth to a lonely tomb. Anna. To sanctuary. Raoul. A stubborn, little devil; but the voice! [Anna watches him trembling, till he has passed the gateway. Then she stands steadying herself on the hilt of his sword.] AliÃ©nor. He is gone. ... Why do you stand there? Is the sword Too bitter for your courage? Give it me. You cannot take death from his hands. You tremble, You dare not kill yourself, nor go to him, Lest you should kill his soulâyou cherish that: You cannot rock in Hell and put away The scorch of the flame for kisses hotter far, More blistering to the flesh. And all the while He is dying for you, dying for your hands, So white he finds them, dying for your voice That plays upon him as the jasmine-scent ... I know just how you play on him. To think That he should die simply for love of you Who know not any of the ways of love! This is his blood Bright on my fingers, but his death is clean Of blood as a starved captive's. [Flinging herself down.] I am lost. This weft of purple hair, these lips, this beauty, Except he want it, ruby of the mine, Hid in the dark unclaimed, that sparkles not, And will no more be ruby! Wrath of God, That you have come betwixt us with your love, Your puppetry, your pride, your phantom words That are not of Love's action. Love degrades And lies and is most treacherous, can murder Be murdered and still worship onâO Love! [She grasps the sword; then, catching the expression on Anna's face, dashes it again on the ground.] No, not yet; I will not blunder. Let the sword clash back Its barrier, as he willed in his remorse. I see your purpose; it is in your eyes. Fair mistress, your soft, moony eyes are dark. I have seen the moon grow ardent; that is fatal; It scorches with its ice. My sovereign ladyâ [Catching her by the sandal.] Anna. Loosen your hold. What should you know? AliÃ©nor. With honour You think that you can visit him, these bands Of white about your head, and half a nun. But if you pass his castle-gate you bear him Full charter of damnation. Near of kin, Light of behaviour; and the Church forbids: The Church will lay him under ban. ... This tomb You live for shall be rifled by the dogs At pleasure in the moatway. Even so, Flung forth as any refuse-heap, O Raoul, My own, I shall be hungry for thy corpse. I have the jackal's patience. [The Nuns cross the courtyard to the chapel, singing.] Anna. By the altar The Count is buried. There, beneath the stone, My Abbey shall receive him. You remain My prisoner; somewhere there must be a cell Where the dark forces silence. Ah, my nuns, My sweet, fair sisterhood, and they are singing, Are singing with the stars. I take their song, I join their chaunt: there is deliverance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV CrÃ©py-Valois in snow.âThe evening of the next day; a dark, small room of the castle, hung with tapestry. Dressed and roughly covered with skins, Raoul is discovered lying by the window on a couch. Fernando turns from the casement. Fernando. There is a creeping sunset on the plain That dazzles me ... Raoul. Then it will soon be dark. When darkness falls it is a sign to sleepâ The blest, brief journey! But death promises No man shall ever wake us from our dreams; Therefore I am not fearful of my death. Have you no torches? [Fernando springs from the window and takes a torch from its socket to illume it.] Leave the lights alone! I would remain neglected ... You are dull. Can you not gossip with me by the fire? Tell me the news abroad? Fernando. Our Regent's dead. Raoul. Whence came that tale? Fernando. From Senlis. Raoul. Ah, I see, A message for the Queen. She answers it, Collects her jewels, that rare hyacinth, King Henry's gift, her treasure, and departs For Paris and the Regent's funeral, To take the title she rejected once. Fernando, do you know why I am dying? Come close up to my pillows ... Men will say 'Tis of this feverish wound that I am grown More feeble than a child. Is it, Fernando? ... O Love, beloved, Our life was paired so nobly, not an hour Of life but had for us the self-same smack And relish on the lips. After a year Of full fidelity to grow of a sudden So small and alien! I believed the woman In her was equal to the man in me By strength of Love's unmediated glory, That she would leave all dreams and adorations Before supremacy of love's own fact: Henceforth we were one body and one life, One world together, that no God, Madonna, Priest, demon, all the names Love does away By rising of himself, could ever yield To chaos and the old, unmeaning night. I thought that she was free within the kingdom Where all are free who keep upon its shore, And breathe the air its mountains and its groves, And sap-bright valleys heave. O deep romance Of truth's divine audacityâthat land She reached with me! And then, congealed by fear, And with a murderer's lip, she left the shore, And grew bond-woman to the hollow regions Where popes and bishops and chill duties rule. I was alone ... but in that bold, free air To be alone is death. [He starts and looks out.] A lightâout yonder! Fernando, I have never seen a hut, Not there. Keep close, close to the window-pane. How my wound hurts! You do not turn your head. Three horses! They are dark upon the stretches Of recent whiteness ... horsemen! But a shadow, Like a long branch's shadow in the sun Of leafy June trails on one charger's flank, And is not shadow in this winter-time. Still hard upon the verge ... Fernando. Such space between! And they must travel slowly; there is ice On the rough, broken track. Raoul. Oh, they have patience, So patiently they will pick out the path, And spare the beasts and wile away the time; They will not press. ... [Silence and vigil.] Fernando. [Suddenly kneeling to Raoul.] Think of your soul, my lord, Your soul. Raoul. Fernando, does a drowning man Think of his body? All my soul's at clutch Of the eluding waves; I fight for life, And, by the Holy Heart ... Fernando. Hush, hush, my lord. Raoul. Dare you deceive me with that track of light You know is Jack-o'-lantern? Boy, be blunt, The Queen's in Paris? ... [Anna enters unperceived.] And I cannot die Without her; you must send for her again. O Anna, Anna! [With closed eyes he falls back moaning.] Anna. [Speaking quietly like a nurse.] Do I hear my name? How sweet! You have been thinking of me, dear, All the long while that I have been away? Look, I must shake my cloak to clear myself From the snow, before I kiss you. O beloved, Out of an icy world I bring but this, My love, my love, my love! Raoul. You love meâay! That may be so; you left me here to rove At will among a thousand memories: That is your faithfulness. I am forsaken, Too near the grave for anything to reach me That is not far away. Oh, softly, Anna, We should be speaking now of our first love. The aged and dying in their solitude Turn to their youth, and there they seat themselves With one beside them ... Let me hold your hand. Anna. [Sitting by the couch.] And I will speak to you of our first love. Listen! Raoul. I will not. Did King Henry come Into your childish dreams? Anna. I speak of youth. One must be solitary to be young; Youth is quite solitary. Love, the forest Where I was born began hard by the Dnieper, Began, and had no end. [Raoul closes his eyes.] I thought that there The dark was made in the deep firs, enough To cover all the world. I dreamed of heroes, Of one ... While I was small he rescued children From cruel packs of wolves, and afterward He was a noble, like my ancestor, Philip of Macedon. I dreamed he loved me, And promised him my hand: in the deep woods We met and hunted. I was torn away To France, and then I did not dream again, Till ... Raoul. [Opening his eyes.] Senlis, where you fooled your life away; But now the Regent's deadâno fairy-tales! Anna. I had forgotten. Raoul. Anna, do not lie. Forget the Regent's death?âyou start asideâ Forget your duty to your son, to France, What he was born to claim, what she demands, All you neglected while a madness raged? I know that you are come to say farewell To one you leave behind: we always turn And turn when we go forward on our way. I catch the movement: I am not deceived, But stay until the end, stay to the midnight; Then fresh to Paris at the earliest dawn! [Lifting himself violently.] If I were absolute, you should not go, Not even then. If death must saddle me His own pale horse I would be swift astride, Could you but dare the leap into my arms. You dare not. You forget the Regent's death. Liar!âforget your majesty. Anna. Fernando, I cannot hold him longer in my arms: I think I am half-swooning with the cold. [She sinks down at the foot of the bed.] Raoul. That's nothing! Birds will drop down off the bough If the cold strikes them. You! ... [With a hollow laugh he falls back unconscious.] Fernando. [To Anna.] But he is dying! Anna. And I have lacked the patience of a nurse, The comfort, and I cannot be forgiven. Fernando. [Kneeling.] Ave Maria, to thy gracious trust And bosom of thy mercy I commend Now, at his hour of death, my master's soul. I think of him no more; I think of thee, Thy plenitude, thy power. To sanctuary, O clement Mother, of thine open arms I carry him. Thy fugitive is safe. Ave Maria! Anna. [Involuntarily kneels by Fernando, weeping.] I cannot bear my love, Except God help me. That is foolishness! I think Love is himself a god who falters To bear his cross without a mortal's help. What shall I do? I am afraid, I shudder ... For I have lacked the patience of a nurse: It cannot be forgiven. When he wakes ... [She rises and paces the room. Fernando fronts her.] Fernando. If that should be, if, by God's wondrous grace, Life should return and my dear master live, Will you upon whose lips I hear such words As blow about in flames where love is cursed, Say, will you tarry by his side and offer His soul to hell, his earthly days to ban That sucks them dry of hope? Say, are you come, Now that he lies On the pale confines of the body's death To hold him backâyou can? ... then to prepare His spirit for the kingdom of hot shrieks? You can, you can! But be more merciful. Those hands of yours have been a saviour's hands, Royal, divine in charity, a queen's, A saint's. Oh, pardon, if I misconceive, If in my terror I should take your action Wrong in its gist. Anna. I come to flood this soul With all that it has lostâlove, virtue, trust, Each golden whiteness, each enduring force; I come to dwell beside it and be steeped In all I had foresworn. Fernando. Declare the worst! You come ... Anna. As excommunication. So I bear the chiming truth of happiness In hands made pure to touch it; so I sound Its compass to the universe, to him Here and hereafter. [Anna continues pacing.] Fernando. Oh, how terrible! Then I will pray, pray for his instant death. What straits you put me to, what monstrous pangs! I love him, love the master I can touch, Whose eyes I waken with the morning callâ Love him until I tremble and grow weak At thought I shall not serve him my whole life With life on to the end: and of myself You sentence me to kill him with my prayers. I would far rather see that other one, That woman who has tempted me to sin Against him, my adoredâthat AliÃ©nor, Who is his wife, beside him in her shame, Than see you here and know there is the burthen Of his perdition on your smiles, most cruel, Most sacrilegious! And the time is short. [He moves to the far end of the room and prays.] O Christ, Thou must be crucified afresh To save him, for Thou didst but die in vain On Calvary ... Thou must go down to Hades, Thou wilt, Thou canst. I love him as Thyself, As Thou must love himâJesu! Sacred Heart, I pray with bleeding heart-wounds, let him die, Let him not wake! Anna. [Still pacing.] In my extremity I rode forth swiftly, dashing from my lips The rally of his bugle, till the stars Twinkled for very joy. Love, love, O love! But I have lacked the patience of a nurse, The comfort, and I cannot be forgiven. [She bows her face in her hands and again crouches by the foot of the bed.] Raoul. [Murmuring to himself.] Fernando! They have all forsaken me. And yet I will not callâ Her cloak is there, And I remember she is fast asleep. I will not waken her, for then I fear She would desert me for a funeral. And yet I must. Did she not challenge me To ride through the dark bramble of the stars? Anna, my love! [Snatching back the curtain.] But you are on your knees And praying for me. So you feigned a swoon. Anna. [Rising.] I am not praying. Raoul. [Springing up and steadying himself on her arm.] In the very act. O liar, you forget the Regent's death; You are not praying. Faugh! You will not steal To Paris in the dawnlight, giant lie! You did not love me on the cruel steppes Beyond the pale of light. You love my tomb, And you are praying for me by the fire. Anna. [Pointing to Fernando.] Listen, he prays. Raoul. With that averted face. And you were praying too, I saw you both With the red firelight playing on your hands. I saw you so at Senlis in the sun The day that you betrayed me. Nay ... no touch Of those soft hands. Where is your wedding-ring? Hid by the rubies? ... Let me strip it off. I have a consort ... This is not the end. You think I will die tamely by the fire!â I cannot perish in a hissing sea, The levin of my mast-head on my eyes, Like my great Viking ancestor, I cannot: But I will stop those prayers. Get from your knees, Fernando! There is something to be done. Is the boy deaf? Anna. [Supporting him as he staggers.] What is your will, my lord, For I, your wife, will be obedient. Trust me. Raoul. Then I will trust. Fetch AliÃ©nor: Bid the boy fetch her. Fernando. Oh, how happy! O My blessÃ¨d master! I will run at once To speed fulfilment of my urgent prayer. I prayed for this, and it is come to pass. Anna. Not yet: you must await the miracle, And pray her to my presence on your knees. Now, say, my lord, if I believe in prayerâ I would rather see you dead before me, dead, Than for an instant you should catch her face, And yet I bid this boy pray on. I know I shall be safe while he is on his knees. Fernando, pray. Fernando. It is to test my faith ... Mother, accept this perfect sacrifice: Thou dost not need a mortal messenger. Send of thy legion angels the least page To do this service. [Raoul, held by Anna, sinks back on the bed.] Raoul. But fetch AliÃ©nor. I do not understand: you say you will, And yet I do not see her. I am weary; I cannot listen. Pull me back that arras, I think there is a moon. [Anna uncovers the casement further.] Ah, now I see her! How fast she travels! You may leave me now, She speeds along so fast. But I am sinking To a darkness in my head. Fetch AliÃ©nor ... [Anna brings down the curtain.] Anna. St. Vladimir, but I will disobey! Let there be utter darkness, lamentation Wild as my heart. These uncaressing hands! But I will curse him with old cradle-songs And snatches of fierce music. One can sleep In the full darkness, if one hear a voice, The living beat of life about the roomâ I know that from a child; and I will play The nurse's part, and keep the regular, Low singing as abateless as a clock, While I arraign my lover. Love, beloved, Is it not hard enough that I must call you, That of your own accord you will not come? You will come swift enough when you are dead, Life keeps us so apart. Remember, dear, Remember how we two in autumn nights, My own, would wander, just we two together, And whisper secret words. O winds, warm winds, Warm autumn winds! ... but, no, I must not sob, For now he breathes more gently, he is sleeping, And I must keep him in forgetfulness With any childish memories of my brain. If God would give my love a little healthâ And if it were but for an idle day, A single hour, to tread the mossy turf, To pluck the magic gentians ... He will wake. O God, O God! I cannot keep the chaunt, I love him to such fierce extremity, And he rejects my loving. What temptation Urged me to leave him? Did I not abide With my great lover for a year secure From every qualm. Did he not say to me, When the mute Church stood by us like a tomb, âHenceforth our comfort must be in ourselves, The creatures that we are, the love we love, And those deep wells we draw from for our life, Our bosom's captive founts.â That faith was good For autumn, for the hunting-field. The winterâ That changes all. If the warm life's to come In winter, it must be by miracle. I thought of my great hero in the cold Of Pagan death ... With energy of pain And absolute surrender, I went forth, Eager to yield him up, to leave his side, So from my hands he might receive the gift Of Christian burial and an honoured tomb; But still there was no miracle. At Senlis I prayed for spring to touch my sterile heart As once before ... He stirs uneasily. Again the measure! Come to us, O Spring, Come to us, Springtide, with thy joy, thy goodness, With thy tall flax, deep roots and plenteous corn, Thy healthful springtide water. Give us health, Beautiful, joyous Spring. It is the same, Whether at Senlis or far down the banks Of glorious Dnieper: there are many gods, And we may make them idols every one By prayer and sacrifice, but not by song; No singing is idolatry. O welcome, Beautiful, joyous Spring! I feel it nowâ Fernando crying to the clement Virgin, Or my own people on the flowered steppes Prostrate to black-haired Perun who brings forth From earth the living water, I myself Praying for motherhood, we have one cry Come to us, Spring! O healthful, springtide streams, Even to us give health! When he awakes ... Ah, but how deeply I have sinned against him, Fearing and doubting. Of my many gods I must ask pardon. O forgive me, all Ye heavenly host; forgive, O sky, O sun; Ye stars, forgive! And thou, damp Mother-Earth, Green mother-grave, and thou, O very holy Mother of God, forgive! I have blasphemed. Forgive, all earthly, heavenly elements; Fountain of Life, forgive! When he awakes, He shall not need the lady AliÃ©nor; I do not think that he will ask for her. But, oh!âthe time is short, and he is sighing That terrible short sigh that like an arrow Pierces my heart. I will let in the moon. [Singing at the casement.] Softly, O lovely moon, Fall on the bed! Barushi-balu! Clear, Bright moon, fall on the head I love so dear. [He moves on his couch; she holds herself from going to him, and keeps motionless at the window.] Raoul. Is Anna gone? I must have slept awhile, Listening to musicâ'tis as something stopt That pressed beside me like a brimming stream, A current in procession to the sun. It saved me, drove back chaos from my brain. If it would sing again! The light is lost Together with the musicâthat must be! When the angels sang there was a flood of light. Nothing can ever move the dark away, Except a madrigal. O Anna, Anna! How softly she is singing to the moon, Beside the casement at the window-bars, Or is she singing? It is all of gold. Anna. Barushi-balu! 'Tis the lullaby They sing in Russia, where the pines are rocked, Where the great forests fall asleep at even, Where the snow binds the hurricane. O moon, O lovely moon, shine clear upon the bed With thy great crystals from the Caucasus. Pour light upon my hero! Raoul. I am faint ... I wake to find myself in shattered walls. Anna ... I wonder is she dreaming now Of the rushing stream of darkness through the firs? For if she dreams I know that it will be Of Scythia, of her youth. How good it is To meet in the deep passes of a dream, How good to know she loved me even then In the days of youth, of dreaming. Anna, there! And will you sing in Russian to the moon, While I am dying? Pour me out some wine, And chafe my hands ... Anna. Fernando! [She motions him to reach wine.] Raoul. I could drink it Better from you. [She chafes his hands.] You have a touch that passes Right through me like a whisper. You are false! What matter! I am dying. Give me wine. Anna. I will not. Speak, Fernando, bid him drink. Your lord believes you faithful. Pour the wine! Fernando. [Offering the cup.] Dear master, as I love you ... Raoul. There, a pledge! To my fair wife whoever she may be, And to this fairer lady of the hour. I drink to each. Anna. [Dashing the wine-cup from his lips.] Better to faint and die Than rail upon my faith. Raoul. You dropped the arras, And in the darkness I am tossed about As under choking water. Anna, come! Anna. I will not. Raoul. Then your voiceâthat song again. Anna! Anna. I will not sing. What! let a drop Of the freshness of my spirit fall on you, Who, as you die, would take indifferent My kiss, or any wanton's ... Raoul. Anna, Anna, You do not understand. Though you desert me, And hymn your Pagan heroes to the moon, I have you in my blood, and you can pulse it To any tune you will. Come hither, childâ It were a royal action. I am helpless, I cry you mercy ... In the stony dark I cannot catch your hand. [Enter suddenly the King, Gervais, Courtiers, Priests and Torch-bearers.] Oh, here are lights, The very flare of hell, and noise enough To maze the devil. Did I order lights? Who is it ... visits me? Philip. [To Anna.] Mother, your son. Gervais. [To Raoul.] The Church, your mother. We have ridden fast To Senlis with petition to the Queen That she should rule now at Count Beaudoin's death Her young son's realm, left regentless. At Senlis We learnt that she was here, that all her saintship Had been abjured, that by your devilry, The fever and the madness of your spells, She had again been mastered. Lo, again The curse of severance from man, from God, Hangs over you, if stubbornly you keep This woman as your wife, and with the bonds Of sin encompass her. Raoul. Nay, she is bound By you, herself, her God, her liesâby me She is not bound. Leave me! I hate you all. My former Countess will herself appoint Her widowhood. [He turns to the wall.] Philip. Then, mother, if indeed A mother's name is never of the past, And never can be former, but, like God, 'Tis first of its own nature and endures ... Be loyal to him whose blood is from you, hold For him your dignity. You stain the fountain, Staining the source that flows in desecration, Once foul, through all its waters. Straight forsake This subject castle, and beside your son Be seated as the queen of his whole realm, Till years full crown him. I was tender young, When first you left me; I was innocent. I climb toward adolescence ... Cruelly Knowledge burns through me that reproaches you Here at this vassal's bedside. By your prayers You called me into life; by mine, by mine I call you back to motherhood. Gervais. This voice, Hear itâthe echo of your anguished cry To the most Holy Mother of our God, The very tones! Anna. [To Raoul, who gradually turns his eyes to hers as if at watch.] I am a Russian Princess, A stranger to this France of yours, and if You die I shall return to my own land, Where there is skyless forest: by the Dnieper I can be solitary and forget These titles I have borne. Philip. Madam, your son Claims some authority. Anna. My child, my child! Put those armed looks away. I have a portrait All gentleness and smiles. Philip. I cannot, mother, I cannot leave you with your paramour: You bring disgrace on me and shame to France. Anna. I am a Russian Princess and a stranger; I must go back soon to my native land, I feel I must go back, away from all That ever happened to me in my life. I bore you to the King ... go home and rule. My part has here its end. Raoul. [In a murmur.] O love and love! [Philip turns his back on Anna and joins his courtiers.] Gervais. You drive the child God gave you from your sight, Child of your prayers and heart-sick vow: he leaves you With alienated face and such despair As clothes itself like hate. Recall with him The blessing of your past, the blessings promised In future to all futures! Oh, call back Your womanhood, your queenship, your religion, Your sainted victory, call back the love That once has triumphed. Shall this sinner die Looking to you who are indeed his death? Fernando. Save him from death! He is your loved one, save! Anna. I am most absolute. If it be death For him to look on me, then I am Death. Leave us, each one of you. Farewell, my son, I shall not see you any more. Forget, In the wide thoughts of state, my name; remember You are King Henry's heir ... and prospering Time Be golden till your season pass away. You frown, you will not kiss me. It is well. I go from you as choosing my own fate, And in my choice I seek what others blame And have dark brows against. Farewell, Archbishop! It is too late; your power is broken. Gervais. Nay, 'Tis at the prime, unspent. Raoul of Valois I here pronounce is excommunicate, Curse to himself and curse to every one Who shall approach or aid him; he shall wither Unburied as a criminal, and find His portion with the lost who wail in shame Their destitute rebellion. He is dead To God, his God, and to all Christian souls! Anna. I plunge into his dark; I take his curse. [Exeunt all but Fernando, who has sunk on the ground with a cry of agony.] Oh, this is happiness! my lord, my life! Raoul. [Laying his cheek against hers.] At last, close-wedded! There is nothing, heart, We would obliterate: all, all the hours Of love in wrath, of love in blasphemy, Are precious to us; I would carry them Far on into my soul. Anna. Where do you go? BelovÃ¨d, where? For in the old religion The soul that's dead must sail on a wide sea, Or travel over plains. Raoul. [Stroking her hands.] Love travels so, Across the sea and wilds. Anna. I have no terror. I would go with you wheresoe'er you wend; But tell me where! Raoul. A-wandering. And your goal Is in the Russian forest: then our tryst Be there, 'mid the great fir-boughs, where the dark Begins and has no end. Anna. Yes, in the forest Of the black firs and snow. There will be freedom And silence there. I shall not be afraid However you may come to meâa ghost, An apparition ... [Raoul sinks back, then draws her down to him in a strait embrace.] In the deep fir-shades, As thus, together! [He dies.] [After a while Anna rises and completely shrouds herself in her mantle of ermine. As she turns to go she perceives Fernando.] And the boy still prays. Fernando, will you come with me? Fernando. The corpse! [He goes to Raoul's body, lays a crucifix on it, and kneels again by the bedside. Anna, without looking back, walks through the open doorway.]</field>
