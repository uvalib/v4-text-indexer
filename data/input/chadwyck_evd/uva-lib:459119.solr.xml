      <field name="fulltext">To the worshipfull and his Constant friend, Mr. Io. Dickinson, the Author dedicates this Modele of Inconstancie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument in briefe. Cinthia's Altars be neglected by the chiefe estates of Sparta; both King and Councels adiudge her diuine sacrifice, religion, vowes, worship and adoration to appertaine especially, if not punctually, to the weake order of women; because they are subiect to changeable toyes, which take their primitiue deriuation of Luna: Shee therefore inflamed with resolution to qualifie this error, as to informe how farre from iudgement so ir-religious opinions did arise, doth first possesse the humor of exalted subiects, with manifest ambition, breach of duty, and allegeance, libidinous concupiscence, flattery, faithlesse engagements, which in themselues fauour of Cinthia's large instability. Pheudippe (on whom the Kings loue reflected with more extreame zeale) she averts from his obedience to rebellion, by the power of prædominance. Mænander noting a change so manifest doth (by collection) attribute Pheudippe's false-hood to her suggestion; resolued confidence begat his rage; his rage, blasphemy; which blasphemy doth againe exasperate the Goddesse: her indignation followes, which with violence brake forth in yong Mananders vehement madnesse. A states-man, old Euphorbus, doth compassionate his agony, and for a second purpose, counterfets an artificiall extasie, whil'st conceited humor makes Mænander follow (like Cinthia) diuersity of shapes: from Poet he fals to a Player, then to Aiax, from thence to Mercury, in whose habit, assuming the most sacred essence of a substance incorporiall, hee enioynes Euphorbus to make some experiment heereof by his poniard, being perswaded hee was impenetrable: Euphorbus easily induced by temptation, as pretending to establish a new Monarch, doth oppose and kill this eueryway deluded King: A generall approbation doth thanke his pollicy, which made a finall Catastrophe of madnesse; and so reuenge is pacified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend the Author. One Swallow makes no Summer, most men say, But who disproues that Prouerbe, made this Play. F. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his much and worthily esteemed friend the Author. Who takes thy volume to his vertuous hand, Must be intended still to vnderstand: Who bluntly doth but looke vpon the same, May aske, what Author would conceale his name? Who read smay roaue, and call the passage darke, Yet may as blind men sometimes hit the marke. Who reads, who roaues, who hopes to vnderstand, May take thy volume to his vertuous hand. Who cannot reade, but onely doth desire To vnderstand, hee may at length admire. B. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his true friend the Author. I was vnwilling to præfixe one verse; Thy booke and Poem may it selfe commend, My duteous zeale doth make mee yet rehearse Rimes of thy worth, none as I am thy friend. For Ladies may, thy Poem cannot need An Vsher to lead on, or to succeed. G. Rogers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Endeered Author. Long let thy Muse her wished seate inioy, Into whose breast shee fertill store doth bring, Which makes thy penne the cause of her imploy, By pleasing stile and Poems shee doth sing; Amidst whose lines sweete Laurels vp are sprung Which doe adorne their sole effectiue stemme As flexile branches, fittest to be wrung Into that forme, of Poets Diademme. What shall I need then to inuoke at all? Or wish applause from out the vulgar crue? I leaue such praise to men iudiciall: They giue each worke that to it selfe is due, Whose lauding palmes, might ymp an Authors Pen, And raise a Phœnix from a silly Wren. Tho: Danet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus 1. Scœna 1. Cinthia. The chiefest point of Kings felicity, Some subiects do esteeme Authority. Wee are aboue, the Potentates of earth Be vnacquainted with high bloud and birth. We do transcend supremacy of Kings, Account them (as they are) most mortall things. Subiect to putrification, to disease, To folly; which no phisicke may appease. Yet they do magnifie themselues alone, Their haughty stomackes doe acknowledge none Aboue; who may such dignity surmount: Of power supreme as fables they account. My God-head may with priuiledge complaine Of Sparta; whose proud factious Kings refraine By wicked councell, from due sacrifice At my religious Altar: they suffice To render duty in Olimpickes once, And rob me of an—tique oblations: Which wee ascribe vnto the base repute They do conceiue of our Diuinity, My Temples honour and supremacy. To Matrons (Bauds and Widowes) they translate To seruice of weake women dedicate My whole prædominance; they do exempt Mans homage, and beleeue my power of change Extends no further then the female sex. This new-conceited error Il'e refute, Il'e manifest how farre compulsiue change Doth ouersway proud man; Il'e execute The rigor of my vengeance: dreadfull awe Gods do obtaine by a correctiue law. And thus will I restore that holinesse, Which they extinguish through bold sawcinesse: Mortals contemne the Makers Diety, Vntill his wrath scourge their impiety. Scœn. 2. Menander , Hipponax, Evphorbvs, Lelio, Phevdippe, Hyarchvs, Perillvs, a Hearse. Nature acquainted well with indigence, Defining (in it selfe) our impotence, Liable to corruption generall, Shewes, nothing doth endure that's naturall: Sterne death no pitty takes on hallowed age, Vpon the sucking babe, whose harmelesse twine, Tenderly hangs about the nurses necke. Neuer did old mens holy teares obtaine, Neuer did death from Innocents refraine. The slaue who smothers in obscurity His hated life; who neuer did account Of rising Sunne, eclipse, and prodigies, More then of customes and impertinence; Neuer accounted seasons, months, and yeares, Autumnall haruest, Spring-tide happinesse, Further then meanes to nourish misery, Who neuer lent the busie world a smile, But breathes out melancholy aire, and groanes. This man (alike with Epicures and Kings, Who often striue with a departing soule) Expects vpon the leisure of his fate, So Kings and Cripples be incorporate; Their ashes often mixt, when they repose Two petty vrnes, their bodies oft inclose. Death, how impartiall be thy wounds? how free From all exceptions? My beloued sire, Lusty and full of Spirit fiue dayes since, Here humbled lyes, once royall prop of Greece. Ev. Laments are idle, neither can recall Your fathers soule backe from Elizium. Men. But griefe informes the world hee once did liue Worthy, and well respected, like a Prince, Whom people pray for, and whose happy raigne True subiects craue to be perpetuall. Hyp. But sorrow in excesse (dread soueraigne) Begets a weake distraction of the braine, Breeds a contempt of mundane diligence, Neglects profession, violates the law Of solace, and abhorres congruity, Giues carelesse raignes to sicke security, Turnes nature to a liuing lethargy. Men. True Hypponax, and therefore temperance Limits with reason our compulsiue woe: For men of pure discretion (you may finde) Beare all extremes with a most æquall minde. Repeat Perillus (the last signe of loue) A poem to expresse the Obsequie, With teares concluding his Catastrophe. Per. Feare to offend his farre divulged name, Which (who may mention without righteous fame) Being euer busied in effecting lawes, Commended still with popular applause, Retaining orders of Antiquity, Forbids me to repeate his Elegie: Each clamorous eccho and all forrest-noise Ingendred by the Sylvan Dryades, Be henceforth silent; neuer may such tunes Affoord free mirth to Poets phantasie; Who, may surcease to sing their sacred layes, Viewing the vnaccustom'd change of time: Till future ages do reviue the losse Of our deiected worthy in his sonne, Whose true externall image doth retaine, The liuing lustre of our wonted king, May whose deere genius dwell thy gifts among, And vs prouoke to leaue his funerall song. Maenan. Enough; and in that finall word, Enough, Our lamentations faile: remoue the hearse, His body sleepes: who may the soule reverse? (My Councell) stay, assist me; and because From the succession of new Kings, new lawes Take their originall, I do intend Enormities of custome to amend, Matters (though in themselues erronious) Amended, may proue meritorious. Had but impartiall Fate fiue longer weekes, Allotted to my safe progenitor. He, by aduise of your sage grauity, Had finished (ere this) what you begun, Which (through default) I must remember done. The people of our continent, each sexe Both masculine and female, do adore A Goddesse, whose essentiall part is change, (Proper to widowes, virgins wilde, and wiues) Antiquity doth call her Cinthia; The honour, sacrifice and Hecatombes, Spent in the solemne, superficiall awe Of her accounted-sanctimonious law, Are (without æquall number) infinite. We, knowing her supremacy extends No further then weake women, will abridge That annuall expence, and will confine Such customare deuotion to the sect Of Priest-hoods fœminine; their simple sexe Shall by iniunction worship Cinthia, To whom indeed they be subordinate. So, this decree of priuiledge exempts Men from oblations: Let an Officer Informe the people thus. Omn. We all subscribe. Maen. Your dutifull acceptance (noble friends) Of this propounded pollicy, doth vrge My secret nature to disclose the loue Which was inflam'd when iuniority Of yeares and iudgement (my associates) Gaue me aduice, which a more grounded age Doth entertaine, with equall permanence: With selfe-same feruor and integrity Of true entire affection, as before. Hyp. What Spartan Lady will oppose the King? Evph. What Spartan Lady doth Mænander loue? Maen. Nay friends allow the marriage of your King, A matter lawfull first in generall And thence refute the scruple so precise, Which boulsters vp a life Monasticall. Omn. That scruple wee as errour do account. Men. Then Il'e aduertise in especiall, You sapient hearers of that beauteous dame, Who, vnredeem'd Mænander, captiuate Doth hold in fetters, though a free-borne King, The daughter of Hyarchus doe I loue. Hy. My daughter? vnexpected happinesse! Giue me then leaue, sweet rauishment, to see Her glad espousall celebrated once, By which, but some coniecture may arise, To see the royall issue of her wombe; And Il'e go lodge in my forefathers tombe. Maen. Do all agree with this old or'e-ioyd man? Hip., Evp. True subiects will commend Mænanders choyce. Men. Nothing doth more prevent a Princes fate, Then wise directing Councellors of State. Scœn. 3. Malindo , Hirvdo. Grosse indignation! manifest repulse! Am I neglected? O disdainfull Prince! May wee obserue thy peeuish altitude, Like a contemptiue groome or Sycophant, Without your glaunce and poore espyall? Iudge, O iudge my quarrell some ingenious man, Witnesse my righteous challenge of his pride; Resolue me some indifferent arbiter, How to digest this ignomious pill. My loue and duty both reiected thus? My dignity esteem'd so little worth? My salutations frustrate? Some poore doult, Who payes a curtesie and supple cringe For euery dram of aire hee suckes in, Cannot be vs'd with lesse humanity. Wee, bending, stoop'd before his Maiesty, Hee, with a crabbed countenance, cleane auers'd, Goes on like some dull statue; neuer stoopes, Nor smiles, but with a frowning arrogance, Iust like a moulded picture, like the frame Of a supported Image, doth moue on, As by some artificiall new deuice, Puppets are seene to make a solemne daunce. He now attended with a barball size Of sober Statesmen, doth reiect my loue, As if I were not in full æquipage Of his owne yeares: nay almost of degree, Excepting his high place of Soueraigne. O pride of Princes! ô how forceable Be scornfull frownes from an offended King? This argues guilt, and makes me culpable, Without a conscious crime; without pretence Of any thing committed: In defence I therefore well may pleade pure ignorance. What new suggestion should exasperate The Kings displeasure? doubtlesse, he of late, And his bigge title, was more affable, More gent and curteous: but the crowne perhap Is heauy, and requires the cunnning helpe Of those gray dotards (who indeed possesse Our most deluded Monarch) to support A thing so massy, and immence; proceed, Soone may my wrathfull curses ouertake The proudest veine of their aduanced soules: May the vaste concaue of Olympus cracke And giue a signall to our Gods decree Of dissolution ready to approach, Of earth and heauen their latest period, When I repent my curse, or do abstaine From an effectuall meanes, which may procure Destruction, though delai'd; yet deadly sure. Am I not noble? bred of æquall stemme With Sparta's chiefe and best Magnificoes? My Auncestors (remou'd but nine degrees) Knew neuer man below the bloud of Kings Worth æmulation, as a riuall fit For them, admitting mighty Emperours, None as aboue, but as competitors: From those heroicke monuments of Greece, From those Hyrudo you can testifie, Our selfe deriues a lineall descent: And by the law of Heralds dignity, (A sect supported by antiquity) I am enrould amid the chiefest ranke Of Dukes, which gouerne this Peninsula: Yet shall I trauerse so obsequiously, Within the glaunce of his huge altitude, Like some deiected melancholy Asse, Which feeds on thistles. Hy. Death! you are abusde, Were I the man appointed to sustaine, So vndeseru'd a signall of disgrace, The proudest King in Europe should perceiue, I'de not digest an iniury so base. You being the subiect of such high abuse, You should with faction terrifie the King, Amaze the Court, and make your opposites Tremble againe like babes, who shaking stand, Doubtfull of mercy from the Tutors hand. Were I the man whom dignity of place Entitled to such vaste prerogatiue As you enioy, no scandall, no disgrace, Should touch my honour without full reuenge: The King himselfe should not escape my spleene, (Vpon so iust a quarrell) I'de affront His ample greatnesse: nay expostulate On equall tearmes, why without open cause He should reiect my seruice with a frowne, I'de taxe him of vngouern'd appetite, Selfe-humour, peeuish ignorance of state, And charge him to amend infirmities: If like a tyrant hee but durst reply, Rating the licence of audacity, Then would I menace torture; I would teare, The big voluminous Title he doth weare Pin'd on his backe by parasites and knaues, Who though they want, yet can bestow much grace, Kings when they leaue to be vpright, are base. Mal. Make me acknowledge this thy loue sincere, Bring thy magnanimous courage into act; O be my agent, reconcile the doubts Which do possesse my intellectuall sence. The Statesmen are my sole Antigonists, They do seduce and steale away the King. Keepe his heroicke bounty for themselues; They doe detaine his nature punctually, Make him (deluded) parsimonious, Erect who pleases their magnificence, Who them displease, the king must frowne vpon: They do entombe the silly wretch aliue, Make him as dead, to eminent designes, Which they approue not; then reuiue his will, To aduenture such, as none approue but they. In briefe, they leade him like a Lyons whelpe, Tame, and yet fierce; if so the keeper please, To wurry with aduantage: then beware, Those who offended haue the keepers will; By which, the tame-taught Lyon's gouern'd still. Hy. Beleeu't my Lord, a home-bred naturalist, Whose resolution neuer was confirm'd By art, example, or experience; Who neuer knew a faith historicall, (That low step to a warrant rationall) His anger would be ready for attempt; Nay finish all with very good successe, Whilst you revolue a tedious aduice, Of which, too long delay doth spoile the prize. Mal. But sir, the high opponents, who traduce My honour, and good name, be numerous, Men of no dung-hill breeding (not aduanc'd By some especiall Madame of the Court, For a concealement of her secresie, In case, where witnesse, bawdy hand, or seale, To broken Titles be restoratiue) But matchlesse in their eminence of birth, Not sprung from petty page, or foot-boyes race, (Onely remou'd, to fill vp vacant place, And rob iudiciall statesmen of deserts, To whom by Nations law, all fame reverts) No, my assailants be both rich and wise, (Two qualities scarce analogicall, Yet my oppugnant enemies haue both) Rich, wise, and nobly borne; nay fauourites, Men of an æquall iudgement with my selfe, Ingenious they be (though Flatterers) Who with calumnious faction doe depraue My potent fortunes, making birth a slaue. My foes be great, therefore I am dismaid, And to incounter great ones am afraid. Hy. What huge Antæus may of conquest brag, Who ouercomes a Pigmey? or insults Ouer a simple wrecth condemn'd to chaines? May Ioues owne Eagle stoope at stinking flyes? And suffer Owles to penetrate the skies? Well did that mighty Indian dog deserue, Whom neither Bucke, mad Bull, nor threatning Boare, Could from the kennell make to rise, before A stout couragious Lyon, king of strength, Irefull enough, with vengeance in his iawes, Prepar'd for single combat; boldly then Like a resolued Champion forth he flew, And the Maiesticke Lyon fiercely slew. Giue me a man, whom neither multitude, Nor meanes to worke reuenge, can terrifie; Who, though incompass'd with corriuall foes, Immur'd with aduerse competitors, Left eu'n amidst the circumuenting Iawes, Of greedy hounds, and hunters policy; Can, like a whirle-winde, in despight of those, Who with vnæquall faction dare oppose, Fly through the thickest, make their big-swolne mawes, Leuell with stinking lakes, and ditches deepe, Like a Colossus though they stood before. Who may esteeme it an inglorious act, Rather who thinkes the valour not deuine, Which through a banded troope of enemies, Doth, like some bolt of thunder flye apace, And force withstanding obiects to giue place? Men of your size being vrg'd with insolence Of peeuish statists æmulating pride, (A humor most vnnecessary ill) Should, like the murdering Chain-shot, driue downe-hill Castles and rockes, although impregnable, Make mountaines stoope before you, rend vp Okes, Buffet large Atlas with incessant strokes, (Though the supporter of Olympus frame) Till heau'n and earth begge rescue for the same. Yet shallow great-men, they must wise-men seeme, For noble births doe liue by peoples breath; Nor may the priuiledge of birth redeeme Our æstimation, subiect still to death; Bee theerfore wise (wisedome who dares condeme?) If not by nature, then by stratagem. Ma. Thou'art yong (Hirudo) resolute and wise, A plyant apprehension soone will rise; Remember now thy naturall good parts, Thinke if they serue to reconcile the doubt Of my ensuing mischiefe; prethee thinke, If thou dar'st venture boldly to remoue My foes from bounty of Mænanders loue: Which, till the blinded King doe abrogate, Each foole may from my fortunes derogate. Combine thy powers, and ingenious parts To salue the wound of my disgrace, which smarts, And be my creature; meditate withall Our now-declining ioyes to re-install: And be my creature; satisfie the King By some corrupted meanes, or anything: And bee my creature; may some new deuise, Purchas'd by Magicke Art, and hellish prise, Wholly avert the puny Kings beliefe From our opponents tales, which doe in chiefe Poyson my merits; ô abolish those, And bee my creature, or indeed deere slaue I will bee thine; doe but imploy some care To best aduantage of thy agent-skill; Remember then, thou art my creature still. Hy. Know then I loue thee Duke, and must preferre Thy fortunes, though I doe confiscate all, Whom Gods will not releiue, inuention shall. Scœn. 4. Lvcilla, Hyrvdo, Lesbia. The King my brother? No, my brother clowne, Malitious coxcombe, peeuish Spartan-foole; Death brided? ô my torments! Les. Madam know, He is contract already. Lv. To a whore? The strumpet Fauorina? Hy. Hearke iust heauen! She railes vpon a virgin, whose pure soule Might giue example of true chastity To her owne spotted, leprous infamy. Les. Now old Hyarchus laughes. Lv. Her father: yes: A rotten Magistrate, who may thanke warme clothes, Caudels and physicke for each rising Sunne, Which he poore man is made partaker of, His daughter must be married to the King: So, I, degraded must acknowledge one Aboue vs in our female properties. Be boundlesse my exclaimes, and terrible; (Curses) assemble your offensiue rage, And helpe a womans fury to disgorge The poyson of her stomacke, in the face Of a most spightfull brother, whose designe Is vnto me a purge so laxatiue, As my vnable body will be spent With bitter execrations; ô I feele The storme of vengeance wrestle in my bloud, Tempting my soule to bee more great then good. O may the horror of some fatall knife, Finish the blessings of my brothers wife. May she liue loath'd, or neuer may she liue, Till heauens vnto my happinesse shall giue A freedom, to insult and tyrannize, Vpon that impious whore, that Cockatrize. O may new mischiefe tread vpon the heeles Of terrour, to affront the ioy she feeles. Let some infernall Negromanticke charme, Change their expected happinesse to harme. Let many clouds salute their nuptiall morne; With omenons affrights in way of scorne. The height of mischife makes my sorrow sound, As Opo-balsum doth a bleeding wound. Hy. O the rude licence of a womans rage, Who her malignant discords can presage? So, let her vanish, and her gall vnmaske, Till wee accomplish our appointed taske. Scœn. 5. Hyrvdo , Menander, Favorina, Hyarchvs, Phevdippe, Malindo, Evphorbvs, Hipponax, Lictor. My sorry conscience doth recoyle (old men) Worthy Malindo did inforce my vow To proue delinquent, rather then oppose My dreaded soueraignes life (an impious act, Vrg'd by the cunning of more impious age.) O then submit, with pœnitentiall teares Confesse, your age offends the King through feares, Omn. Magistr. Our age offend the King? we vrge this act? Hy. Of murther: yes, you loue Monopolies. Om. Mag. Subtill distraction!. Lic. Silence. Me. Hipponax. Hyarchus we disclaime your subtilties. Favo. My father so reiected? Men. Queene forbeare, Malindo is our faithfull favourite. Ma. In thy protection let our kingdome liue. Men. Welcome braue Duke; be euer mine, belou'd; Accounted in the chiefest scarlet ranke Of vnderstanding Iudices; we thanke Your noble and magnaminous resolue, Your charitable vndertaking; be aduanc'd And euer in my bosome: you are loyall. Mal. Daigne mighty Monarch but experience, Me. Your loue already hath in ample sort, Giu'n testimoniall enough: be grac'd And euer happy in our high account: Another subiect Officer I haue, Pheudippe cal'd; on whom the graces smile: A man so absolute in my approofe, That Nature hath reseru'd small dignity Which he enioyes not. Welcome friend approch, Forsake the Citie, euer dwell in Court; Nay neerer, in my bosome: we obserue Your manifest indeuour, diligence, And all industrious faculties that lodge Themselues in thee with a true correspondence, Wee note your proiects, and esteeme them highly. Phe. I seruile groome put forth small industry, Excepting what I owe in subiects duty. Men. My father, in the latest fillable Of his weake vt'trance, did inculcate often, Thy vnrewarded loyalty: be bigge In honour, and out-shine the radiant glosse Of bearded polititians: kneele before vs, And in vprising swell with a new name: No more Pheudippe, but all-potent Duke Of wide Illirium; (noble friend) arise, We diue into the bottome of thy soule, Which doth ingender a sweet sympathy. Liue long and happy in a Monarchs loue: Malindo, you prouide some Theater, Some regall shew, wherewith we mutually May solace and disport our heauinesse. Hyrudo liue: May treason euer finde The biting tortures of a troubled minde. You magistrates imagine it a curse, And punishment beyond all punishment. (If you attainted are with any guilt Of so enorme designes) thinke it a curse To sucke vp the salubrious aire, and liue, Fame will infect you, though I pardon giue: Omn. So prosper we as we are innocent. Scœn. 6. Malindo , Hyrvdo. Good slaue I thanke thee, thou hast reconcil'd The Kings distastfull and ambiguous frowne, I must enroule thee in the Catalogue Of my professed fauorites: contemne The seruile clog of stooping curtesie: Enioy what euer in the bounds of freedome. Be idle, and securely friuolous, Wanton or any thing that appertaines Vnto a noble personage of worth. Or if thou wishest a contented life, Free from the cauils incident to worth, Bee onely idle, euer gazing out Of publique windowes, and obserue the pride Of such a man, faire mounted on his cloth And gelding dapple gray, accounting all His footmen, till the coltish bayard stumble. Bee whom thou pleasest, whom thou dost suppose A blessed man is, absolutely rich. Hy. All this demands a furtherance, my Lord. Ma. Yes, and that furtherance will I bestow: But the most noble haue their enemies, Their opposites, antigonists; nay some Of ragged base repute do still suruiue, Who (notwithstanding) dare maligne the state Of vs, though splendor to the Common-weale. These vomit forth each scandall, each contempt, Malice and gall together: poyson choke them; I feele their aspicke venome here involu'd, They wound worse then a raging Basyliske. How bitter is the taste of contumele! Some patience I intreate thee (heau'n) bestow Vpon our scandalized name: Reproch, That common aduersary of vs all, Who are in a good way to purchase fame, Doth dog vs to our latest winding-sheet, Euen to the wombe of our great grand-mother, That neuer satisfied wombe of earth. Blame not my zealous anger, I am hot, And carried with true valour, to the pitch Of an exclaime so requisite: ô slaues, And prodigies of nature, that will taint Pure sanctity; nay, eu'n the Gods aboue, And their incomprehended holinesse; Their sacred essence, with like blasphemy; If but enrag'd awhile, as they do mine. Hy. Who? or what man is he that dares do thus? S'death I will not endure the sight of him. Ma. How? speake that againe, doe you remember well? Hy. S'death I will not endure the sight of him. Ma. No? why thou vngratefull man; must I aduance, Must I search out a lodging for thy soule, And make roome for thy friendship in our bosome? Canst euer hope to bee incorporate With my owne essence? the same man almost, And not endure the presence, nay the sight Of our malitious foe? recall your thought: Each timorous fellow, that abhorres the name Of absolute reuenge, could say no more: What? runne away from our contemned foe? Hy. Il'e not endure the presence; nay the sight Of such a slaue, yet neuer turne my heeles: No, I'de embowell the base rogue at first, Contriue a quicke dispatch: the villaines heart Would I expose vpon a mountaines top, Or offer it vpon my faulchions point, Fresh bleeding to some wrathfull Deity, Of vnappeas'd reuenge, in sacrifice: I'de mixe my vrine with his reeking blood, And pisse vpon the carkasse in despight, Disseuer ioynts and flesh, till all were done, Then toast his marrow in the melting Sunne: I'de not endure the sight of him aliue. Ma. Couragious resolution! I commend Such vehemence in valor: this doth vrge And animate my purpose to be quicke, Royall, and open-breasted to a man Of such full vndertaking euery way. Let vs imploy this youthfull vehemence Betimes: a quicke bloud cals for action. Imagine this the pauement where my foe Hath fixt (vpon the quarrell) his firme foot; For know that such a villaine doth suruiue, Whom I will scourge in thee my fauorite, Briefly you must disgrace and murder him Whose name is hitherto conceal'd; but you (After instruction for the stratagem) Shall know the varlet, whom you must imagine (Meerely for apprehension) is your selfe. I like a ruffaine (which remember well, You must hereafter practise) though for instance I will now vndertake it, vnawares I fetch away your not misdoubting heeles From of the trampled earth, eu'n thus: then sweare Some oath of high importance, that the aire Shall neuer be infected with a slaue, Who breathes out poysoned blasphemy on earth. Sweare then that neither shining light of day No interchanged seasons shall affoord One minute more of blessing, that himselfe Shall not enioy one article of breath Beside, to aske forgiuenesse of the world: Sweare that no planet, no supernall starre, No Hercules, no Gigantæan arme Shall rescue villaines from appointed harme: Then spit him through the center of his heart, Eu'n thus, Hirudo. Hy. But you iest Im'e sure. S'death I am slaine; forbeare, ingratitude! I perish without expectation: O. Ma. May my suspected agents perish euer. Scœn. 7. Malindo , Messenger, Perillvs. There sleepe (vnthought of) in a vaulted tombe: Thus great men must be iealous of their fame, Preuent all blemish in a noble name. Now King and kingdome both are almost mine, Lights be obscured when the greater shine. The King reputes me loyall and submisse, (Transparent coulour to deceiue a Prince) (But hell beare record) I am bent to ruine, To purchase kingdomes, or impeach my state, Who neuer ventur'd, neuer knew his fate. In Epires rule now liues my noble friend, Thither will we addresse our false complaint, Pretending I am hated here at Court, Threatned to death, not likely to escape, Withall insinuate our appointed ioy, Which fiue dayes hence the King doth celebrate. Informe I may, that then both Prince and Peeres, Will bee assembled in the Theater: And being so, how safely hee may send A manadg'd Army to destroy them all. (Dissembling still the meanes to rescue mee When I am safe aduaunc'd) but meaning most To further my aduancement: for which cause I fram'd this little motiue: Hoe within, Fly to the confines of Epirots rule, Deliuer vnto Cassius my friend, The Gouernour, this caution heere inclos'd, Vrge him vpon allegeance euer due, From one friend to another, to make haste. Speake this, and speake no more, neither to any Open the passage dores of vtterance, But to my friend, my deere, my best beloued, Mes. Imagine me a blocke, a Niobe, Conceiue my mouth to be deuoid of tongue, Till with content I do accomplish all. Ma. Bee secret as calme silence, or the night. My care must follow to frame Theaters, Warning the Megalenses, our Comædians To act some pithy and applauded Scœne, Wherewith to shadow my pretensiue zeale. But well-incountred (Poet) pray approach, And let vs parley of an Enterlude. Per. Patron of Poets, much esteemed Duke, Leauing the Muses, and my pleasant cares Regarding yours more then my owne affaires, Poore Poet Il'e attend your conference, Command mee euer, most ingenious Lord. Ma. Command Perillus? no, intreate thee rather, Each high-borne Title must aduance the worth Of holy rapture: pray informe the Actors Of some true Morall, of some Tragedy Or else some subiect more ridiculous. Which may with new deuis'd conceits stir vp The dull and solemne audience. Per. Beleeue Il'e stretch the scantnesse of my Mother-wit, Rather then faile for to accomplish it. The God of Kings protect thee: so adiew. Mal. Attempts of great men speake in siluer tones, Thus gilded tombes ore-shadow dead mens bones. Scœn. 8. Cassivs, Sovldier, Messenger. Sov.

Arme if thou lou'st me noble Cassivs, And helpe thy brother with a royall rescue, I am in prison, prethee make great haste, Or I am dead; 'gainst Ianus-festiuall, Addresse thy courage to assault our King, Both King and Statesmen kill, for fit occasion Will bee afforded, while they sleepe secure Busied with ioy, and iesting Cordials. Arme if thou lou'st me noble Cassius? Yes, arme I will, and in despight of spight Rescue thy valor from the blackest night, Which enuy, or malignant wrath can yeeld, To darken thy resplendant fortitude.

Alas I lou'd thee well, why didst deuise Such fatall Scœnes, fashion'd of bloud and death?

He faint (for faintnesse euer doth attend On such designes) being faint before the time Of on-set, he withdrew so speedily, As, that retinue of his rebell-slaues, Beg'd noble mercy of the Conquerour. But wee, like some fierce Gyant giu'n to spoyle, Enrag'd with a remembrance of their act, Their too contemptuous vp-rore; did reply, With anger vnappeas'd in bloody phrase, That no compassion should redeeme their liues From famine of our faulchions: for indeed, Rebellion must be scourg'd vntill it bleed. Then flew the common Souldier with such speed, To enterprise in rigor the new spoyle, As neuer did a hungry Woolfe insult With more vnsatisfied reuenge, then they. Grim Slaughter in a Chariot of dead sculs, Rode vp and downe triumphing, till darke night Shooke off the fetlocke from her sleepy iades, And gaue way for retrait; each man before Troad in contempt vpon the scattred foe, Vntill my fortune, rather then exploit, Slue the once owner of this vn-ioyn'd scull, Then euery man gaue backe, with blood being full.

Me. To deifie the worth of whom wee loue, Aduancement Il'e impouerish, compell Honour to hugge thy kinsman, till a warmth Quicken his humble bloud without controule. Enuy, (the scourge of Kings) be henceforth dumbe, Thus will I treason euermore entombe. And thus exault our loue beyond all merit, Birth may do much, loue makes the low inherit.

Amidst my slumber, circumvolu'd with doubt, In this thicke midnight darknesse, now all sence Securely lyes inchain'd; now potent dreames, With vnresisted awe, rule the dead lumpe Of mans poore fabricke; now all humane flesh, Kings, and the sterne-brow'd Tyrants doe submit Their maiesty to Sleepes Imperiall feet. Now, not long since I dream'd, and could with ease, Vtter the subiect, how a mishapen hag, His haire full horrid blacke, huge were his eyes, Bigge, like a bowle encompassed with bone, Thrice did the Impe appeare, did vanish thrice, Three massy Crownes, of worth inæstimate, (Had they enioy'd a worth substantiall:) Thrice did hee shew, and thrice againe withdraw The hallowed obiects, then a pace proclaime Quod libet, licet, and away departs. I then awak't, strooke with extreme amazement, And nimbly leaping from a secûre couch, Came to expell this ominous affright. Reading, or whatsoeuer can auaile The vigor of temptation, to withstand, Wee should perhibite (though against our will.) Heer's an aspiring Poet, whose proud touch, May eleuate some braine aboue the flight Of nimble apprehension; Il'e vnclaspe Thy sacred volume, Lucan: Il'e content My rouing fancy with full argument. He writes of witherd sculs, of mutiny, Ominous apparitions of the dead, Of Cæsar, Pompei, and Imperiall state, Of combats forreigne, of domesticke broyles, Of dire inuasion, of ambitious warre, (What-euer makes vs noble) fortitude, Of expert vndertaking, of euent: O hee's a fellow able to inflame The frosty stomacke of a staru'ling youth, Who wholly feeds on rheumish winter-plums. An Author of commanding Altitude, And such a man giue me; a man of worth, Who makes the reader rub his paled brow, Makes idle nature melt away in fume, Giues breath and courage to out-puffe the Cannon: Such Authors you may feele at fingers end, They gallop in your bloud, prouoke each veine, To giue them passage without violence, Bella per amathios plusquam ciuilia campos Iusq, datum scelers canimus populumq, potentem: Nec quenquam nunc ferre potest, Cæsar-ve priorem Pompeius-ve parem: quis iustùs induit armæ Scire nefas: magno se indice quisque tuctur. Ah Pompei, Pompei, if thy hallowed acts, Once more might flourish, I would æmulate Those bold incounters; ô most happy men, Whom Fate enroules to bee victorious: They conquer, spoyle, subuert, and ædifie Turne Dukes, nay Kings to common Parasites, And make the proudest flatter to winne life: Yet Kings are mighty: yes and æquall too; (Though weake, although base cowards by the law Of naturall indowment) yet the name Doth yeeld them æquall; nay aboue the same Which often doth enrich a conquerour. What may we hence collect? a principle, A maxime of no vulgar consequence: Subiects are base, and to acknowledge one Superiour, doth note seruility: O what a most perpetuall slaue is man, If not the chiefest in prædominance? Let obscûre polititians be content As chiefe in Parish; or some petty Towne, I'de make Dominions tremble with a frowne: Make euery subiect, high and low obserue The heauy danger of our discontent, Or make a precious forfeit of each life. Woe to that King where subiects be inflam'd With greater zeale of eminence then hee: There must inuasion triumph, timelesse death, Rapes, murther, all iniquity of age: By gulfes, by rockes, eu'n by the iawes of hell. Wee swim who would obtaine the gates of heauen. O what a large deuinity's involu'd About the awfull phrase of Emperour. The name, the name of King, how it awakes Our caitife blood, quickens our faculty! Ambition be my iudge, if I were sicke, Wounded with pistols, out of hope to liue, Forsaken by all Art and physicke law, Lay speechlesse in my chamber, lost my sence Of man or voyce making no difference Yet through the magicke of this powerfull sound; You are a King, (if hallowed in my eare) I should againe recouer, should recoyle Skip forty fadome from the couch, and sing, Dance without shame, though naked, without noise Trample amid the pauement, touch my roofe, Run giddy with glad passion, rub my veines, Like one reuiu'd anew, esteeme all base Vnder bloud-royall, be a ranke mad man, Till ioy and rapture both were cleane digested. How readily mans temper is traduc'd? How forceable temptation doth oppose The supernaturall act of doing well? Wee are like windemils on ambitious mounts, Open to euery tempest, which will turne Our sailes without resistance: like the waues Wurried from shores to rocks; from rocks to shelfe; Man is not man till he deny himselfe. Yet on our state's impos'd a slauish curse, To see things good, though we conniue at worse. Scœn. 2. Phevdippe, Lvcilla. Lvc. Ah husband, husband, what excessiue care Inuaded me with violence? shot farre Into my shaking bosome, when I saw Your sudden absence? heauy sleepe alas No sooner left mine eye-lids, gaue me leaue To aske, how does the comfort of my soule? How does my silent loue? my deere Pheudippe? But with familiar lip, and flexile arme, I seiz'd vpon the pillow stead of thee. Thinke how intruding iealously began To blurre whateuer I could wisedome call, Within me, or without me; which alas, All know's extreamely dwarffish in our sexe. Ph. Iealous the first night wife? Lv. O then or neuer An honest, louing wife is iealous euer. Iealous at home, least husbands ouer-vex A painfull heart with meditation, Of matters which concerne his family. Iealous when husbands bee enforc'd to trauell; Danger exceeds the obiects they do meet, Whether by sea, or in the publicke street. I (peeuish foole) perceiuing you were gone, Thus in my choler did expostulate: Doth hee for some dislike abhorre my sheets? Neglect what others loue? the maiden sweets Of mutuall embracement? may mens taste Loose their accustom'd relish, and refuse The mellow ioyes of ripe virginity? Will he contemne the sportiue dalliance That married couples may engrosse with leaue? Will he this mid-night shew himselfe no man? The first night of our meeting bee disgrac'd? Or will hee by disaster end all strife? Perish? and so preuent a formall taxe That may impeach his manhood? Thus, euen thus Poore foolish I did thus prævaricate; Thus (for indeed wee women struggle much Vntill deliuer'd of opinion) thus Did louing zeale præiudicate amisse. You are offended (loue) I doe suspect See how his colour's chang'd, astonishment! Prethee what pensiue thoughts oppresse thy soule? I reade the humor of a malecontent Written betweene your eye-browes; recollect The common sparkes of scatter'd Maiesty. Speake gentle sir. Phe. Women, women, women. Lv. What of women? Phe. Most women loue to talke, To scatter tales, and yet sweare silence too, To breed sedition, to deceiue all those Who in simplicity are confident, Of honest meaning: ô they doe insult With a tyrannicke boldnesse ouer one Who through bewitch'd opinion, doth impart The substance of included secresie. O they wil dare the soule of such a man, Make him so subiect to their base command, As if they had his heart-strings in their hand. Lv. Raile at our sexe? why husband, though perhap Such women do suruiue, what will you hence Conclude within their guilt, my innocence? Phe. 'Cry mercy wife, 'good faith I did imagine Their wicked conuersation, generall, (All in good time be otherwise:) But wife, The painters of our age be culpable Of high abuse committed; they portraict Each mentall vice in habit of a whore, A Hagge, a Witch, or Woman, at the least. Lv. Vertue (although the others opposite) Is painted with the like habiliment, Therefore conclude, if tender woman-hood Take any full impression of deceit, Vertue, or vice, of either strong beleefe. Or colourable incredulity; To change her minde will aske another age. You may conuert beliefe, you may reuoke Errors of wise-men, by a deepe dispute, But women setled, nothing will confute. For painters do imply this consequent By embleme; that our sexe is permanent. Phev. Are you so philosophicall I'faith? Well dost thou argue, for thy sexe and selfe. Shee bath a ripe conceit, and I approue Her subtill apprehension, out of loue. I relish her deepe iudgement; for indeed, My railing labour'd onely to obtaine Of wits reply the due experience, That in our wisedome of credulity, We may impart a proud conspirasie. women shoot faire sometimes, though seldome true Like whetstones they giue edge to trickes anew. Braue Catiline for this cause did account Yong Orestilla worthy to partake Of his attempt (though farre aboue the braine Of woman to accomplish) hee approu'd The talkatiue Sempronia: Thus will I Induce my wife through cunning circumstance, To giue directions for a raw conceit: Though man is rather bless'd, who may with-hold His closet-counsell from a womans eare; Yet am I of such spungy clay compact, As till I am dis-burthen'd of my care, Nothing yeelds comfort: ô I must vnclaspe A volume, which may preiudice my life; Happy's the man who dares beleeue his wife. Lv. What magicke may this motion ocular Of lips, without all vtterance portend? Phe. For men to pause at a poore stile of Dukes, Most frequent Lords, and yet more common knights Proclaimes them base and triuiall; if meanes Of more aduantage may be thought vpon: Thy father was a King Lucilla. Lv. Iust. Phe. And shall the Chronicles of age report Lucilla was no Queene? Were I a woman— Lv. The Madam Fauorina doth vsurpe My due respect. Phe. Shall Fauourina liue? Shall she out-shine the beauty whom I loue? Nature, nay Gods deny a double Moone, They both are ominous; they do import A prodigie of vprores and of death. Lv. O man assist our weakenesse, wee'le enforce The potent succour of religious fate; Con-iure by solemne othe, deepe secresy So crowne the vigor of conspiracy. Phe. Now spoke dame resolution: I adore Such credible ingagement; and embrace Faction aboue all true fælicity. I can discouer yet a childish vice Within my nature, named cowardise: I feele a fearefull and familiar stamp That shewes I am a coward: I recoyle In thought of high atchieuements; I dissolue With repetition of a sound so braue As conquest, and impartiall victory; Yet would subdue Dominions; would enthrall The vast Horizon of our vniuerse: But I abhorre the sound, of enemies; Of proud resistance: Ambiguities (With cowards) are begotten of each tale Of each phantasticke rumour; idle care: A new suggestion will beget new feare. If notwithstanding women will bee stout Women (the badge of clamorous affrights) This would encourage slaues to victory, And shall encourage mee: my wife is valiant, No creature liuing must (Lucilla) dare When twise two Moones haue made a change in Greece; Dare to accost thy super-eminence Nor with like priuiledge (as now) affront My then sublim'd authority: be iudge Thou happy time, when that more haughty phrase Long liue, shall be pronounc'd, with ????? twise Wee'le then disclaime acquaintance; liue re-cluse; Then if wee are dispos'd to imitate Some liuely gesture of disdainefull grace, And peepe into the publicke aire awhile, The thronging Citty will be crowded vp In a poore handfull, to ex-patiate With rowling eies our vnaccustom'd face. Lv. I am inflam'd already: O ambition Be but auspicious; mount my nymble breath And win the Gods good liking to command Of earth and heauen a hopefull furtherance: Swell heart, and with it swell my brauest bloud, Sug-gest new motiues deere necessity, Resolue now for a lucky plot betimes. Phe. Nay first resolue of some associates: Three to a banquet, foure beget a braule Sayes our instructiue adage: but i'faith Fiue to a bloudy banquet makes all square: A banquet (wise) a banquet, shall enthrone Our happy wishes and our hopefull ioy: The King shall dye. Lv. Yes, and the new Queene perish. Phe. The Captaine of his Guard will I corrupt With forceable engagement, and faire shewes: (Chiefe architects in a designe so rare, Sole agents for the great men of our age) Him if I do seduce; the Souldiers apt For innouation will obey betimes: My sonne Amilcar (by iniunction bound) Must then remoue thy opposite, the Queene: My faithfull steward, sage Mantesio Hee (by commandement) shall engrosse the corne Which haruest hath afforded; and procure The famishment of those who may resist By insurrection our new seated blisse.

All that is Courtier in me, who contemn'd To'acknowledge one aboue me (but my maker) To sue for friendship; cogge for patronage, Who was enfranchis'd by the Kings decree, Had no reuenues but a morning bribe, (Which now of late are pretious things, all men Haue so inclin'd themselues to subtilty, As they conceiue a Courtiers gullery) But I was well prouided for, before A fowle disaster of such consequence, As peeuish gamesters lucke oppress'd my soule. All that is Courtier in me, now compeld Must vanish into smooth-tongu'd flattery. With oyled gums, and with a supple arme, I must salute my patron (though a foole) Insinuate how many blessed yeares Hee will enioy, to blesse my indigence: Tell him how plumpe, how lusty, latter time And my yong mistresse make him, though his face More full of wrinckles then a practis'd witch With pittifull hoofe-shoulders do consort: So, like a fawning Spaniell must I wagge At every costiue wind-fall of a crumme; Bid fare-well to my Courtiership, and liue, Like an arch-foole, a Sycophant: flye hence These childish terrors to my pained soule, The chiefest Courtiers will my kinsmen bee, My fellowes in profession, my colleagues, Nay æmulate my worth, if I excell, In the most ample trade of glosing well.

If without scruple therefore we can boast, In so compleat a fashion as before I did inculcate; then Rusticity, To Gods and Monarchs may well answere free Thus doth improuidence of hare-braine mates, Buy little wisedome at excessiue rates: 'Tis indeed better to bee wise at last, Then gallop head-long till our hopes bee past.

Arts-maisters will transgresse the rule of Art; Nay our precisest schoole-men will forsake The principles which they haue authoris'd, In cases that concerne selfe-avarice, And greedy lucre: knowledge is inforc'd To follow by constraint, abuse of time, Wit mis-imploy'd gapes at improper ends: Strong men are impotent without rich friends.

Ami. Haue you lost all? Gr. Some fifty hundred crownes. Ami. O the vncertaine lot of idle game! I long haue knowne thee. Gr. And haue known me honest. Ami.

Imagine whilst you doe ingurgitate My poyson'd soppes the beauty of your sence Of your ingenious parts (all donatiues Of Natures bounty, and the Gods aboue) Imagine they'le be chang'd with violence With vnresisted lunacy; so long, Vntill each spirit leaue her function: Till with a surfet you sur-fease to liue Neglecting mundane solace; be trans-form'd Into a liuelesse image, all thy veines And vitall arteries being stop'd with feare: Thus much remember Queene I do præ-mise. Fa. Amplifications yet? begin, begin: Ami. VVith all remember, you (right noble Queene) VVho may attend my tale, are but a woman. Fa. And whether will your prolixê Lord-ship amble? To the worlds end I thinke in preamble: That (after all) you may anew begin. Ami. No (my compendious Lady) heere's an end: Obstinate silence is the safest whip To punish a peruerse disciple with. Fa. Are you enraged iolly sir i'faith? O be appeasd, leaue ambiguities; Finish thy tale (man.) Ami. Worthy Madam no, Your supple phrase shall not againe recouer One vowell of narration. Fav. O abrupt! Yes (my blunt youth) if torment may vnbind Your costiue silence, know, I will recouer The whole narration; if deuulsiue rackes Haue not forsooke the Kingdome; if the King Will hearken to my spatious complaint; Or yeeld with exoration of his Queene. Amil. Your spatious? ô then Arithmeticke Hath taught you to augment and multiply: (Deere Madam) speake within the bounds of truth. Fa. (Cheape Lord) thy impudence shall smart for this. Ami. O bitter! Fa. Thy dumbe silence be inforc'd To witnesse, nay reiterate the depth Of your concealement. Ami. O pernicious. Fa. You shall rehearse, nay shall expound, this tale Of prodigies. Ami. Without your wide complaint Without all torment to enforce the same I will expound them straight; and therefore thus: Ladies by birth of late are satisfied With natures gifts, nor leeke they to resist Impediments of age, or stinking breaths, But well are guided by the heauens decree Respecting beauty lesse then the command, Of Gods aboue; be not these prodigies? They honour husbands, hallow chastity Reiect all midnight offers, liue within: Abhorre the name of lustfull visitants, Take little relish in a home-bred foole; And lesse delight in Physicke, or the knaues Who practise that purloyning office well. Be not these prodigies deere Madame? speake, When Ladies do bestow their idle time In scrutination of deuinity Not seeking to beguile the abused Art Of painting; or to wish fiue Iubiles Might be allotted to their tumbling tricks And coltish vntam'd pleasure; which they vse To practise without intermission: speake: Be not these prodigies deere Madame? speake When Ladies, and light-women be estrang'd From Para-kitos, Munkies, island-curres Coaches, and Coach-mares, masking nouelties; From waspish æmulation, to exceed Some eleuated Madame in her gowne; Some Iuy-bush attire; to engrosse The knowledge of a fucus, dentifrice, Vuguentum, plaister (for in-faith sometimes Diuerse scab'd sheepe do perish for defect Of these restoratiues) ô then resolue When Madames do estrange their facultie From inquisition, from delight in these; Will not the mouldred ashes that haue slept So many thousand yeares, againe reuiue? Will not the crazy ioints of earth dissolue? And rotten fathers be resuscitate? The finall extirpation of each dame Both light and sober may this tale portend Be not these prodigies deere Madame? speake. Fa. Wisedome doth vrge me to entreate him faire Least hee indeed dissemble, or conceale Businesse of high importance, that may touch My most perticular aduantage: (sir So-well-accomplish'd, meritorious Count) I must importune your dexterity, To re-collect the now-forgotten tale Of prodigies indeed; withall confesse My peeuish error. Ami. This doth mollify, Nor may redemption of abuse, though late; Although abruptly offer'd, derogate From the large sequele; either thy beleefe Or my vnfeigned meaning (noble Queene) But Madam you shall seriously admit A most impugned caution, ere I speake; And shall obserue the same inuiolate, Without base mentall reseruation. Fa. Wee will engage our female Maiesty Thy strictest of iniunctions to prefer Aboue all temporary baits, which may Allure smooth falshood to infringe the same: Sweare by this image of Paladium, (Reckon'd amongst our Sacramentall oathes) Neither by subtle tokens nor by voyce By second causes, by secure complaint, Vpon malitious, or well meaning termes, To manifest, diuulge, communicate, Nor any way disclose the future plot Whereof you shall anon participate By processe of relation. Fa. I do sweare And will submit my life to thy aduise. Amil. With priuiledge, then Madam, Ile expresse The wicked meaning of your enemies: Lucilla my proud step-dame, doth abhorre, Sole repetition of thy harmlesse name: Shee doth repose her chiefest confidence In my audacious act, who am oblig'd Vpon surprise to kill thee. Fa. Subtle whore! So yong, and yet so full of impudence? So full of indignation, causelesse wrath? Enuy how feeble are thy foming iawes? With vndefined rancor they attempt, But seldome are obnoxious to any, Who haue acquaintance with integrity; For enuy (vpon spight) assailes the henge Of our successe: but wrong enflames reuenge: And therefore did high Ioues omnipotence, Envy; vnto the female sex impart: Woman's a witch by Malice, man by Art. How, how (Amilcar) may wee recompence The new disease of her indignity Which would entice, and so corrupt thy youth By fraudulent commotions. Ami. Ile instruct How opportunely, Madam, you may meete With her abusiue malice; and exempt Your selfe from the suspicion of reuenge. And yet reuenge will be conspicuous: For all complaints and publicke remedy The primitiue iniunction doth deny; You therefore shall admit my new deuise, When Summer makes each field, each medow faire; When pleasant spring-tide musicke is in tune, You may retire into this thicket-groue Loosely attended, with one maid, no more: Whilst, like a common souldier in disguise I suddenly rush forth, and do surprise You not misdoubting, whom I will conuey Into my lodging neere the Citty wals After all inquisition cease: till then, Wee may re-past in some poore Country Towne. Fa. The manner I allow; speake for euent. Ami. (All men amaz'd with such a sudden chance) I will subborne a simple ideot (Being first oblig'd by bounty) to confesse That hee through wicked instigation Of my most infamous step-dame, did attempt, Nay finish the supposed murther; then That meere compunction did enforce the tale; To mittigate, his wound of conscience. Fa. So hee may hazard life being innocent. Ami. No, hee may craftily insert a boone VVhich will auoide the danger of his life. Hee shall beseech his death may be defer'd Till my vnlawfull mother by the Law Tast execution, or hee will professe Obstinate silence; so conceale the place Of your pretended buriall; the King Nor any man aliue may this deny; But I'le instruct him when hee doth espy Occasion; this to manifest aloud The Queene doth liue, though I were tempted oft By that malitious woman, now depriu'd Of naturall bad parts, by righteous death, (Meaning my mother who shall then be dead) To slay whom I preseru'd, this hopefull Queene. Fa. The plot prouokes me to esteeme reuenge Aboue all earthly blessing; and embrace The subtle vertue of a painted face. Ami. Subtle indeed, for my pretence implyes Nothing but foggy mist to blind her eyes; VVhen faire temptaion's weake; surprisall must Giue satisfaction to my flaming lust. Finis Actus secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scœn. 1. Phevdippe, Laelio Dvx Militvm, Milites. Lae. Most opportunely did you præ-acquaint My place with a designe so requisite. Phe. Captaine, you haue well easd my anxious feare But bounty shall remunerate thy care: The title Vize-roy (Captaine) doth attend To counteruaile thy meritorious act: The famine doth already tyranize. Lae. VVhat policy procures the famishment? Phe. All insurrection do I disappoint, Subdue resistance, mollify the fierce And peeuish ouer-looking multitude By a substraction of their vsuall foode VVhich will discourage appetite to warre: But vnexpected liberality, And satis-faction of their empty mawes VVith rich aboundance after penury, It will enchaine the base to loyalty. Lae. A proiect most ir-reprehensible. Phe. The chiefest on-set doth belong to you: Doe you conceiue a full aduertisement For each proceeding? punctually relate How your conceite doth apprehend mee sir. Lae. To supper you'le inuite the honest King— Phe. Honest? Lae. I; simple, indiscreet, bloud-raw, Of small experience to beguile, suspect, Frowne, laugh, kill, flatter with a tyrant's face; A King too-open-breasted for this age; And so the world doth honest men account By way of high reproach. Phe. Smooth Orator, Ingeniously well worded is thy speech: May not the sequele perish, now proceed. Lae. To supper you'le inuite this honest King; Hee (not mis-doubting home-bred violence) With a select strong millitary troupe I, and the Guard together, will inuade Murther (a-midst the cups and Magistrates) Him; who shall surfet of each fatall wound; Shall rather dye then see Pheudippe crown'd. Phe. Captaine, thy apprehension is acute Thus bounty will oblige men resolute: With-draw, your seuerall reward is future; A pregnant Pupill thriues without his Tutor. Scœn. 2. Menander, Phevdippe, Hyarchvs, Hipponax, Evphorbvs. Hy. The popular inuectiue doth exclaime Vpon Pheudippe; sweare with open voyce Hee bred this famine. Phe. Am I then betraid? Will my sage Steward turne delinquent? ha? Men. Can my Pheudippe proue disloyall? no, Doth hee intend subuersion of my state? Ev. Wee may consult of war-like discipline Amidst our heigth of solace; (though secure) Although at league with euery Potentate Who sits enthron'd vpon the spacious Orbe. So may wee well aduise your Maiesty To haue a watchfull ouer-looking spy Vpon your haughty Duke; (though innocent; Though in himselfe obsequiously bent) Learning aduanc'd may proue iudicious; But (if mis-ledde) extremely vitious. Me. Tell mee my proper Genius may proue false, My bloud become a traitor to my life; The issue of my loines degenerate; Say; this right hand conspires against my head; Tell mee; the Gods whom I adore, neglect Religion, doe forbid all sacrifice; And I beleeue you: but the villaines lye, Who dare imagine my Pheudippe false. In-faith I am affraid you do abuse My honest friends integrity, too much; Pheudippe false? my bosome-counsellour? The earth will shake at such a prodigy: Some Phaeton shall mount the Chariot Of our vp-rising Phœbus, and enflame The world againe; each widdow shall conceiue Without mans aide fiue dragons at a birth, All threatning this impossible euent, Ere I do entertaine a sillable Of your sug-gestion: though the Gods descend Though they admonish my credulity (In speciall) to beware of whom wee speake And call him traitor; ô I should reply Within the bounds (I feare) of blasphemy. See how hee walks perplex'd with agony; My anger shall im-proue his patience. Pheudippe. Phe. Doth my dread Soueraigne call? Men. What doth my demi-selfe Pheudippe doe? Phe. Beshrew my melancholique dumps I doe; Which preter-mit Mænanders Maiesty Without obeysance; whilst I walke secure In a blind corner thus extrauagant. Me. His aro-mâticke breath perfumes the aire: The spicy fields where gossa-moure doth grow Haue not one vapour halfe so redolent: I must for fashion chide him fatherly. Friend, friend, you are ambitous of rule, Report exclaimes vpon your dignity; All attribute the times calamity Of dearth, to you the Authour; who ingrosse Heapes of prouision without reall cause; I must not winke at fraudulent abuse Done to my Subiects; rather abuse mee: Thou mightst enioy full many blessed yeares, Liue in an æquall happinesse with mee, Rather then thus neglect my sincere loue, And loose the hope of our munificence Do not (I pray) deserue that infamy VVith which our scandalizing age condemnes Thy whole endeuours; ô redeeme the losse Of Loyalty; a thing so pretious. Reiect those machinations infinite VVith which the people charge thee; I conceale The horrour of a rage so violent As some censorious Critticks haue adiug'd To dwell within thy bosome: prethee thinke Whether I do deserue thy impious hand To thrust me from a lineall descent Or (being downe) deserue thy helping hand, To rescue and vphold my primacy. Phe. Some better Angell be auspicious Vnto my naked answere; (mighty King) Your deepe discretion may with ease collect; (Though I were dumb and did through silence purge This weighty accusation) that per-force To publicke censure all authority Is often subiect: so ir-regular Be sudden apprehensions; as vpright And politicke proceedings are condemn'd; The Prudent fam'd for ignominious Mad Authors, of sicke innovation; (Though not resolued how this language meanes:) I do in ample, and with open tearmes Confesse the crime suppos'd, not culpable, Though burthen'd with ambition) I confesse A dutious loue vnto the Common-weale, Hath bred my damage; Ouer-diligence May summon actiue zeale to a defence, Which doth appeare in my ill-tun'd event, As you perceiue, or call me insolent. The famous Art of Mathe-maticke Rules, (Wherein my ignorance will never boast A singularity of knowledge, or conceit) Did by infallible demonstrations Fore-signifie this famine: ô resolue Whether then by the law of Nations I be accomptable vnto the Gods For this pretended accusation; Seeing to the safety of our Common-weale, A prouidence coniecturall hath vrg'd, My whole indevour? If vnto the Gods I am excus'd; what impudence will dare With false-hood to accuse my innocence? For those designes which Gods allow, ne're can Be in themselues offensiue vnto man. Know therefore (vpon hopefull præ-science) I did ingage a new dexterity, To counteruaile the famishment fore-knowne, I did ingrosse provision, did expend Twelue-months revenew to accomplish corne: Ill be my paines acquited, worse my loue; Which, labours in the common cause may proue. Thus imputations are too vsuall, And bad constructions are authenticall. Some Kings, (to manifest prædominance) Accumulate on subiects, heavy wealth, Honour aboue de-merit, offices, Popular Cities, and in-franchis'd Townes; Nay whole dominions, Dukedomes they'le bestow, And raise a simple Mushrom to the height Of any monarch's due magnificence; Till by excesse of labour, sweate of braines, Hee hath enrich'd his beggerly estate; Then (like a full-ripe Orenge; or indeed, Like a deceitfull spunge, whose empty pores The owner doth replenish) hee must looke To feele a sudden crush, a nip will squease Him; who pretends hee may be rich and please: If then my Title (ô iuditious King) My now desertlesse wealth, or eminence, Which (by especiall fauour I enioy, Which freely were bestow'd long since) if these Shall be accounted error and offence, Or be imputed to my sawcinesse, I doe submit, and will my crime confesse; If your vn-reprehended sapience Thinke it a pollicy expedient, Il'e runne to exile, dye in banishment, Liue like a scritch-owle in some secret caue, Turne errant caitife, and so dye a slaue: If you suppose it bee availe-able Or to diminish, or annihilate To dis-anull, or to abbreviate My large allowance; if you doe account The base degrading of a loyall peere Will giue aduantage and security To your successiue regiment; (may which Continue to the worlds æternity:) If thus you doe imagine (dreaded Liege) Loe, I will prostrate fall, and aske a boone, Begge that the heads-mans Axe may ouer-take, May with a bloody sentence, mee salute, With willing voyce, and a more willing arme, Would I the messenger of death re-greet; Till then, most lowly kisse your graces feet: Me. Arise my faithfull honourer, arise: Good honest soule, thy language would enforce The Cannibals to turne compassionate: I will trans-mit thee into Scythia, To Pontus, to the fierce vn-tamed Getes, Till with a fluent phrase, thou doe compell Their savage superstition to submit, And mee acknowledge, as their lawfull King: Thus thou like Orpheus couldst (I'me sure) enthrall The rude Arabian, or the rugged Gaule, And captivate their longing audience With an æternity of eloquence. Thus couldst thou re-inlarge my soueraigne awe, Thus multiply each prouince, thus augment The bounds of our dominion, or de-duce Appointed troopes of Colony; with voyce: But (my alone beloued) never thinke I will exchange thy noble company For temporall possession: though the Gods Would all resigne Olympus, and elect Mee as co-heire in-dubitate to Ioue, Vpon Proviso to forsake this friend, I rather would refuse deuinity, Liue like a drudge in darke obscurity, Then leaue so loyall, so compleat a friend: And yet this man deserues a watchfull eye; Speake you censorious ranke of Magistrates, Doth hee deserue suspition? who replyes? Evph. Reports and rumour did deserue aduise. Me. Who guided by report so farre doth blame Another, as to argue his ill-name, Insisting much on some particular, Detects himselfe, an Asse auricular. Phev. This vn-expected fume to pacifie Let your good grace vouchsafe to dignifie A Summer banquet, and I shall intreate You the Patricians to accept my loue, Rather then bounty; whom I will invite And feast with my beloued Liege to night. Me. With temptiue cups wee'le wash away conceit, And so renew each health in sober height. Scœn. 3. Phevdippe. May then my cauterised soule forsake The rules of nature? sanctimonious law? Religion? or distinct humanity? The common sparke of times morality? Must lethargy now seize vpon my soule? Shall my infectious humor so controule Iudgement? so much preferre fantasticke ioy? Giue licence to dis-loyall trechery? Atheisme? Rebellion? blacke deformity? O most vn-gouern'd appetite of man! Wee may fore see what few escape, e're can. Resolue me, Sophist, or Philosopher, Some cunning morall disputant resolue, If (as the people do maintaine) Gods liue, Gods, who reuenge our close iniquity. And search the re-cluse corners of each soule; Why doe the Gods forbeare to punish me? Who am as wicked as a man may be: Why doth Olympus, or the Gods who dwell Within that fabricke suffer smoaky hell, Horror, impostume, prodigies, and death, Vengeance, delay; to stop a villaines breath? Can such a sublunary slaue as I Out-liue two minutes longer? Thus protract A peace-able successe, without heauens cracke? Can omenous portent, be now asleepe, Whilst I am waking? do the Angels keepe No watch for Kings? then Iupiter awake, And giue the world some notice that you take Especiall care on Princes: ô mee thinkes Morpheus the God of sleepe, who daily winkes, Should leaue his drunken catalogue of dreames, And start with repetition of extreames, Wherewith I am infected; seas should burne, Beares, woolues, and Lyons peace-able should turne Into their antique affability, And argue men of much impiety. Now should thy thunder (loue) assaile the the fort Of my ambitious hope, by way of sport, Blast me with lightning, brand me full of spots; Who haue intrench'd a garrison of plots Against my second maker, 'gainst my King, So credulous, so clement, so sincere, So flexible, and gratious to me, As I without him neuer had my name; Hee hath endeer'd my dangerous attempt, Is both indulgent of each true surmise, And zealous of each tale that may arise, Or to detect, or to oppugne my pride, My most perfidious dealing; doth deride All true suggestion of his Councellors, VVho would exasperate his amity, VVhilst I inchant his eares with flattery, VVith meere dissimulation (Physicke Art) My gilded dagger stabs him to the heart. Can my streperous passion eccho forth A sound so dismall ir-religious, VVithout some sudden earth-quake omenous? VVithout a clap of thunder to be-numme My trembling ioynts, and make my language dumb? Then Il'e inferre the masly frame of earth, Man vniuersall, peasant, patriarch, Grocers and great men, Kings and Copper-smiths, Be gouern'd by the Gods, no more then sheepe, Or Il'e depose, the Gods be all a-sleepe: Scruple in actions doth augment the vice, Which courage hath surnamed Cowardice. Soone may a states-man savour of the Foole, Who leaues his torrent for a standing-poole; Who doth neglect his high præ-eminence For safety of a quiet conscience. All senior Sophists, and each puisne else Account him wise, who's wisest for himselfe. Yet for conceited disputation sake, A long discourse of Honesty Il'e make, Of times corruption will I saterize, And with each cunning nature temporize. Thus doth a serpent, which will satisfie His common thirst, and Summer heat allay, After hee is approach'd vnto the banke Of pleasant Nilus, without much delay, Instinct doth teach him to dis-gorge the bagge Of poyson, kept in his pernitious iaw, Till hee hath tasted the resulting waue; Then readily lickes vp the viscous gall Which hee by nature did e-vacuate, And so remaines his body temperate, His poyson (though suspended) virulent. So when wee craftie fellowes (for attempt) By sudden motiues do remember wayes Which men more honest, name Legitimate, Or by conuerse, if wee shall tempted be, To shew the bent of our affections, wee Doe like the thirsty snake, renounce our Saint, (Accounted sinne) which re-assume wee will; So re-assumption makes the Serpent still: If my designes incurre discouery, I then admit, the King is mercifull, And hee a milke-sop is, (wee may resolue) Can feare, if Kings bee ready to absolue: Noble attempts beget experience, Re-publiques purchase mundane pollicy Through obseruation; my successe will bring Plenty of knowledge: errors difficult Daily in-gender rationall discusse, Which by events doe sweepe away the sinke Or muddy oppilation of our sence, Originall of knowledge is offence: I therefore thus imbarqu'd for enterprise, May win a double stake, learne wit, and rise. Scœn. 4. Lvcilla , Phevdippe, Mantesio. This frolicke euening, full of silent aire, Speakes a successe to thy, atchieuements, faire: Both time an opportunity's, benigne; The Sunne at his departure, seemes to smile, My banquet is prepar'd, which must beguile: No apparitions, no refulgent starre, No threatning Comet can our act oppose, No new trans-figur'd meteor disclose Our most herôicke humor, and annoy The glad conception of all future ioy. Phev. Nay, if a plot so well-contriu'd, so square, So formall, so iudicious, should proue Ill-featur'd, and abortiue, I'de forsweare All crafty dealing; never would I moue, Compassion with repentance; to obtaine Most absolute forgiuenesse, though the King Do then release my criminall attempt, I'de not en-deere his donatiue, except With resolution to escape the law, And wreake more ample vengeance on my selfe, With my owne proper hands, through violence. If a designe so mature, so conceal'd, So rich in expectation, so oblig'd, May now mis-carry, and repugnant proue; Il'e sure prevent the heads-man, hang my selfe VVith expedition, hire a mounte-banke, Some noted empr'icke, to anatomize My polititian corpes, dissect my scull. Boyle tongue and heart together in my blood, Effuse them into broth made of my braines, In which, my vnctuous kidney-lease dissolu'd VVith my more lushious marrow, may compose A poultice, which will speedily contriue The downe-fall of erected favorites, Enflame desire-then disanull the ends VVhich that affection gapes for: I resolue Thus to bequeath my members, to the sect Of those, who narrow inquisition make After each mysticke vertue, physicall; If our attempts proue not effectuall. Lv. Then præ-suppose your proiect well do thriue, VVhat recompence may Lælio expect, Chiefe captaine of the guard; whose instant blow Giues an advantage so peculiar? Phe. That my officious Captaine of his guard The cunning woolfe hath taught me to reward. Lv. Resolue the manner, be emphaticall. Ph. The famish'd woolfe (whom hunger oft endues VVith belly-courage to be valiant) If by aduenture his extremity Meets with a beast of more validity, Though lesse tyrannicke rapine then himselfe, Hee (practis'd in such skill pernitious) Eates clay, to make his body ponderous; Striuing by art to æquall natures strength, Till hee depresse, and over-come at length. By which instinct, his booty once obtain'd, An easie vomit naturall doth purge His lumpish maw of that despised earth; Which (after conquest) hee thinkes little worth: Eeu'n thus the Captaine Il'e re-munerate, And with contempt, Il'e re-capitulate His humble seruice; so casheere the hope Of due re-quitall, with a good excuse, We entertaine those agents but forvse. Heere comes my faithfull steward; speake what newes? Man. The Captaine with his military troope, I haue appoynted to their ambush; they Expect vpon my signall (gratious Duke) The Kings vaunt-curriers doe each testifie His glad approach; giue eare to Maiesty. Scœn. 5. Phevdippe , Menander Lvcilla, Hipponax, Evphorbvs, Hyarchvs, Lelio, Milites, Lesbia. The most of subiects welcome, to my Liege, Accept our weake indeavour, I beseech; Sit (gratious King) the Cates containe our loue. Me. Wee doe accept, and will deserue (my deere) This thy extended free munificence: This plentifull provision I may call, (With licence of our Ethickes) Liberall. Phe. No (my most mindfull &amp; more sapient Prince) I am your vassaile, drudge, obsequious, Not bountifull; for 'tis impossible That a dependant caitife who doth owe His whole indeavour, and essentiall part, His poore existence, spirits animall, His function, his each power vegetall, To a supreame efficient, should obtaine (After a free expence, to gratulate His all-respectiue patron, God, or Saint) One shred or title of Munificent, Of Bountifull, or Liberall, because Duty and loue exact such obsequies For lawfull Kings, instead of sacrifice. Me. What meanes thy mad irruption Lælio? Ph. The ambush, the ambush; strike fellow, strike. Lae. Strike this ignoble traytor, Cockatrice, The subtill vermin base Pheudippe, strike, Strike fellowes, strike, as doth your Generall, Who hath withstood temptation actuall. Hip. If deere temptation, if inticement smile, Happy is hee who can himselfe beguile. Me. Amazement be my death; deere captaine hold. Lae. Hold from the rescue of my royall King? No: Wee were tempted to thy causelesse death. Me. Permit the traytor to enioy some breath. Ph. My wounds are many, I degenerate, Liu'd villain-like, and dye a reprobate. Lv. My husband, my deere husband is betraid, Anothers death makes guilty men afraid. Me. Infamous change of dignity! deere friend, Loyall repentance might againe restore, (Couldst thou reviue) thy simple innocence. Captaine, you haue abus'd our Maiesty, And thy audacious act will wee revenge. Lae. Revenge a traytors ignominious death? Me. Traytor? thou lyest, admit his actiue bloud, His nimble braine, acute sincerity, Conceiu'd some sober meanes to ratifie, Or to confirme opinionate beliefe, With tryall of our vn-attempted loue; May this deserue a stab? what insolence May tearme this loyall proiect an offence? Il'e over-vexe with artificiall fire, Thee (slaue) who didst Pheudippe's death conspire. Lae, May tretchery be then accounted zeale? To his perswasiue lines I do appeale. Read them, they doe containe Apostasie, Fowle matter of sedition: I avouch The guard to witnesse, I implore the Gods In their omnipotence, to testifie The zeale of my affection; to resolue Whether this kingdome had not suffred woe, Thy Maiesty beene trampled vnder foote, Thy sinewes crack'd, thy bones vn-buried, Sparta beene batter'd with intestine warre, If through dis-loyall humor, through neglect Of homage, we had hearken'd to the false, But honey-mouth of this rebellious man. Me. Insolent sir, suppose my friend were false, (Which I can scarce imagine) or suppose Confident faith made him erronious: Will you abridge the tryall of our law? Prevent my absolution? I appeale Vnto the blessed Theater of Saints, Let holinesse, or let humanity, Your zeale, how much defectiue, testifie: For though the three dimensions did concurre In his offence, yet I had mercy left. Pheudippe, simple man, thy false designes Ne're knew a height in mischiefe so extreame, A bredth, or depth in folly so profound, So villanous, but our compassion knew A meanes to mitigate thy error; See My Concubine comes fraught with sober newes; Beginne, resolue, and so ex-aggerate Our heauy losse, wee will intoxicate Our soule with im-bibition of more change: Begin, depose an accident so strange, As repetition of two syllables May strike vs with a sudden lethargy, And so conclude a Kings Catastrophe. Les. The queene— Me. There make thy period; wee know Mischiefe (like mighty waues) ne're comes alone. The Queene's deliuered of a hideous sonne Some winged Dragon; is shee so? or dead? Les. Privately walking in the forrest-groue A ruffaine seiz'd her, slue thy hopefull Queene, Truss'd vp the carkasse on a speedy nagge, Which by instruction (as my iudgement giues) Flew fast away, like Pegasus: poore I (Never-enough contented with a chance Of so secure amazement) stupid wretch, I looking stood immoue-able with feare, Whilst hee vpon his palfrey cut the aire; Whilst ev'ry mountaine eccho'd with laments, The hollow rockes, and ev'ry bush repents Their weake vn-able powers to resist And stop the caitifes passage: ô desist From a pursuit of such high consequence Not a small minute longer; captaine flye, A bold careere may stop loues destiny. Lae. Wee'le flye with expedition; follow friends. Me. Discharge a bullet in my naked breast; Be charitable some auspicious arme. Hyar. My daughter, ô my daughter, shee is dead. Me. Faire Favorina's dead, thy loue, my Queene, My deere Pheudippe's dead our ioyes bee gone Evp Mirror of change! the plagues of Cinthia Are manifest, revenge is palpable, O that assembly (sir) who by command Of your in-iunction did restraine the vow Which masculines a-like with females owe To Cinthia, great Goddesse of the aire, Was without question all-erronious. Hip. Your edict which pronounc'd her deity, Sole-potent ouer fœminine degrees, Which did confine her awe cœlestiall: To that vnable sexe, seemes triviall: These accidents do cancell your designe, They dis-allow your obstinate decree, They doe advance forgotten Maiesty: O now reforme delusion: terror speakes, Cinthia is Goddesse over humane sexe. Me. Cinthia's a female wether-cocke, a whore, Doth shee afflict our happinesse? resolue Speake (friends) deliuer what you thinke. Hip. Abstaine (Distressed King) from blasphemy; beware Iudgements more strict may follow; these but scare. Me. O could I compasse with a sudden leap, The verge of bigge Olympus, or assault With Swallowes-wings, the orbe of Cinthia! O my revenge, my sweet reuenge, more bold Then bloody-iaw'd Bucyris, then the Boate Which slue dame Venus-ioy, should wrathfull vexe Her opposite excelse deuinity. With rage would I blaspheame, though angry Ioue Makes ready thunder to præcipitate My daring voyce: I will ingeminate With deepe derision, her distastfull name, Enforcing others to abuse the same. Doost thou not heare mee Cinthia? dissolue The melancholly clouds which maske thy brow, And let compunction mollifie thee (witch) Forth from thy cloudy pallace (Luna) peepe And with incessant soft contrition, weepe: Reduce the antique deluge with thy teares, Turne thy reioycing into pale-fac'd feares. Cinthia, remember my abuse, and blush, Blush thou immodest harlot, be asham'd To looke vpon the shadow'd vniverse. Catch mee some whirle-wind with a sweeping blast, And carry mee aloft, Il'e vexe the Moone For shee (vngratious Goddesse) doth afflict Vs, and our dignity: shee did suggest Rebell-temptations to my beauteous friend, Whose innocence I euer shall commend. Hip. Manifest proofe (Mænander) doth detect His viperous-reproachfull perfidy, Compos'd of pregnant infidelity: To mischiefe his endeauour's daily bent, I ever thought hee was male-volent: Of crimes detected (blame vs if thou wilt) Despairing apprehensions, argue guilt: Hee did alike despaire: which proceeds From the confusion of abortiue deeds: I do enforce, that Cinthia hath done well, Shee giues good warning to prevent a hell: These weaker med'cines do but search the wound, Least rotten members perish; to confound An vlcerous limbe'is worse then scarifie; But rather then loose all: what remedy? To Cinthia's, revenge ô this apply: Me. Touching her name Il'e proue a renegate, My sudden scourge what soule can tollerate? Scœn. 6. Cinthia. Error of man which over-tops the sky, And with quicke waftage doth for vengeance fly; Cal's downe Gods iudgement (mischiefe to amend) Nay, often doth enforce the Gods descend: Horror, more vgly then the iawes of hell, Horror, that apprehension doth excell, Startles my God-head to imagine how I further may avenge the Spartans vow: Shall wee (great empresse of Imperious night, Heavens wonder, and wide Corinths blessed Saint) Thus be, ô thus compel'd, presumptuous King, To spit our vn-appeas'd flames in thy face? O the sharpe edge of bitter blasphemy! How deepe incision doth attend on it? Flesh cannot brooke one triviall abuse, And shall the Gods (being iniured) take truce? No; Il'e inflict a terror to offence, And will (without compassion) scourge thy sence: For like some snow-ball toss'd vpon hot coles, Thy wit shall vanish, and thy sence consume: A madnesse must ensue, but mad alike, Neuer was any; those that see shall shake And tremble at our vengeance; but because Thy vn-aduised rashnesse railes vpon Our monthly change, vp-braiding holinesse, With a false friends mis-carriage, Il'e impose A change vn-parralel'd, which ner'e shall cease, Till thy distracted body sleepe in peace: The most magnificent may learne of thee, Kings from a dreadfull vengeance are not free: Kings may like petty-gods, insult below, But of a deere-deepe reckoning they must know: Fame, freedome, fates, and all that may conspire To make man happy, shall not make thee man: For Fates doe rescue neither life nor fame, If Gods high iustice do inthrall the same: Nor may the strict evasion of mis-hap, Hurt who secured lye in Uertues lap. But if destruction be aboue decreed, Meanes stop in iustice, few by meanes are freed. Fall then the horror of blaspheaming feares, Not wip'd away with pœnitentiall teares; Till by his death my vengeance be appeas'd, And wrathfull famine absolutely pleas'd. Scœn. 7. Amilcar , Gracchvs. What you already with good cause condemne, I must (though need not) vrge thee to contemne With all extremity of noble hate, Vice which emboldens man to be ingrate. To proue vnthankfull if occasion speakes, The ioyfull head of free-borne bounty breakes: Gr Do but imploy your bond-slaue (mighty Lord) If Kings command not, how can slaues accord? The blessings of my body, breath and soule, Be so ingag'd, as their existence knowes Not one redeemer amongst all the Gods, (Fabulous things to mee) except your selfe: You haue replenish'd my poore empty veines, Haue lent new spirits to despairing hope Nay haue bestow'd a whole creations worke Vpon mê offall-caitife, who adore Impression of your foot-steps; that is all: Expecting hourely on the happy time When you shall dare command what I dare do: When with advantage you will but pronounce O Gracchus, giue mee of thy bloud an ounce: An ounce? take fifty pottles Id'e reply, Open your selfe a passage to my soule, To take a lawfull debt who dares controule? Nor do impute this loue to lacke of wit, Or some dis-ioynted weakenesse of the braine; For if I argue as the thing demands, Vnlesse my life, what with your honour stands? Let mee professe, vnto the Saints and you I do desire imployment, will bee proud Of death or life, being by your selfe allow'd. Ami. Life wee allow, but never wish thy death, For wee expect vpon true diligence, And must improue the nature of thy zeale; Eunuch's, forbidden actions do conceale; Thou art an Eunuch, listen to my shame, Then giue aduise, and secresie, though blame: I loue; no, rather lust and loue the Queene, Whom (all-supposing dead) by stratagem And strong delusion of her silly sence, I did surprize, being blinded with pretence; Nor did shee seeme repugnant to such ruth My Rhetoricke was clad in robes of truth: Affirming shee might thus reuenge the spleene, Of proud Lucilla (who malign's her state) Giuing no colour of reuengefull hate; As to subborne a subtle wretch I vow'd Who with aboundant knowledge being endow'd Most caitife-like should counterfeit, no lesse, (For pænitent compunction) heauinesse; And so diuulge hee slew the Noble Queene, There-to induc'd by poore Lucilla's spleene: Then should Lucilla liue no longer day But loose each vitall benefite for aye: Thus did the hope of vaine reuenge entice Woman to proue more valiant then wise: Whom I (as captiue) do retaine, till shee Shall manu-mit my selfe, (her bond-slaue) free. Gra. Heere in the Village doth your Goddesse liue? Ami. Heere; and thy selfe though sprung of humane seed As Iaylor to my Goddesse I areed. Faithfully wise wee doe account thy loue; And managing of this designe will proue Thy elegant enforcements, touching mee, Which (happily per-chaunce) may set both free. O now my bloud and reason be at warre With apparition of this fatall starre: Fatall to mee, because inchanted beames Shoote from her eye-lids into loue-sicke streames: See where shee comes with excellence enough For fifty thousand of the female sexe, Beauties which blesse the owner, neighbours vex. Scœn. 8. Favovrina , Gracchvs, Amilcar. Are you my Lords attendant? Gra.

Madame hee is the blessing of my fate Borne to my fortunes, and my whole estate. Fa. So: then resolue what newes. Am. All feare is fled: The worst of womans feare, Lucilla's dead. Fa. Most welcome tidings! speake, I pray, and stuffe Your happy speech with circumstance enough. Ami. Titan rous'd vp from darkenesse by the day Shrunke with amazement of the fatall morne, (Remembring what a mischiefe should befall) For cloudy night-caps hee againe did call, When my suborned vassaile gaue consent To swimme (for satisfaction of our sake) Through deepe damnations gulfe, so, through the lake Of vn-digested horror, to accuse My step-dame, yong Lucilla, of your death: Hee, a dissembling caitife, deepely read In ir-religious acts; with doubtfull face More doubted voyce, and miserable grone Salutes the foote-step of Mænanders throne; Then weeping, said, the Worme of Conscience Striues in my bloud; tortures my broken soule; Haunted I am with terror whilst I liue Who to my life a period will giue? A finall period: for I liue too long Let villaines fortune be my fatall song, With which the sorry King was some-what mou'd, And (after silence) did exact his name Proceeding to the circumstantiall cause; My rude impostor did preuent the clause, And seeming to afflict his pensiue heart, Backe from the royall foote-steps doth hee start: Helpe, ô defend mee from her hatefull frownes, See where Medusa-like shee comes, (hee cried) Clad all in torch-light like the Queene of hell Her scalpe's en-circled with a Crowne of flames: Much leane-iaw'd horror hangs about her eyes; The gaping wound for greedy vengeance cryes. What madnesse now affrights thee, quoth our knig? Faire Fauourina's shadow hee replyes, For throvgh entisements of Lucilla's spleene I slew the gallant Bride, and Sparta's Queene: Lucilla, by consent, was doom'd to death And my Impostor also, whom I taught For lifes owne safe-guard to beseech the King, That his vprighteous iudgement of grim death Might faile of execution, iust so long As the condemn'd Lucilla did suruiue Thinking by this, then to discouer all And say hee did preserue whom shee conspir'd to kil. The King, enrag'd with sorrow, did re-pell This poore petition of my totur'd slaue: Who then despairing to escape from death Drew forth a dagger, gaue one fatall stab Into the Kings owne bosome, with which wound Hee like a lofty Turret, nodding low, Clapt his victorious palmes aboue his head, And swore a mighty oath, Menander's Dead. Fa. Mænander dead? My King and Husband dead? Ami. My slaue torne peece-meale did enioy his fate, Lucilla burnt before the Pallace gate. Fa. Mænander dead? Ami. Yes, but Pheudippe's King. Fa. Pheudippe King? Am. Yes; but Menander's Dead. Fa. Opprest with sorrow, I lament his death: But am appeas'd by proud Lucilla's breath. Gra. What is a womans loue? when to reuenge And empty out the poyson of her gall Against some Lady her malignant foe Shee doth forget compassion, doth refuse Friendship to neighbours, duty to her Spouse, Respect of parents, piety to bloud: Nay, aboue these; abhor celestiall good. Ami. Now quickly (Madam) to disclose you liue Were dangerous, and preiudiciall I doubt: Therefore exspect on opportunity, Least you infringe the league of vnity; Till I aduise, liue (as you doe) secûre: Safety's no lesse accepted of obscure And Country Pezants, then of Courted Kings: Place cannot change the nature of good things.

The Mountaine ecchoes they shall catch his name And euery nooke re-iterate the same; For I will teach the night-rauen to repeat His pensiue sound, the sleepy owle shall sing And happy newes of lost Pheudippe bring: Awake dumbe Ghost, Pheudippe, friend awake And now repaire thy old mansion-place; Returne Pheudippe but a while returne And truly answere to my iust demand I will resigne a Kingdome to thy hand. Hearke you mad furies of eternall nighr: Boats-man of Stix, by burning Phlegeton Secluded Angels, and superiour aide I doe con-iure you to direct his soule Backe to the bosome of that slaughtered Hearse Ah Charon, Charon, prethee Boats-man bring His errant shadow to the place of rest, And Charon I will Canonize thy name Giue thee a Queene to sleepe in thy cold armes, To kindle moisture in thy rugged limbes And make thy waftage easy with her hymnes: Bring but the soule of that ignoble man To aske forgiuensse, and I will forgiue. A foolish hope! (heau'n knowes) for hee indeed Hee hath a haughty stomach full of rage Swolne-big with pride, begot of too much loue, And my familiar vsage makes him thinke (The more fault's mine) hee should not now submit. Lae. O sir the finall stab of mischiefes end Hath strucke him dead; hee cannot now amend. Me. No! 'tis a language difficult to learne Though rules be frequent in our mother-tongue. O that a lesson of one word; not two, Should aske a life to learne, an age to do? Yes; though Pheudippes age had beene defer'd Till a consumption of the Vniuerse In hope of his amendment, I beleeue Hee would haue purchas'd immortality Through vice and vitious acts. Lae. Damnation claps, Gaping for custome at mans new relaps. Me. Right: Can the earth yeeld such a faithles man As false Pheudidippe? Lae. O damnation laughs And winged mischeife claps her dusky plumes, If proud ambition great mens hope consumes. Me. What a continuall clapping is there then? For daily hope consumes the greatest men: I doe appeale to dead Pheudippes shame Thou terrour to my sence, a prodigy Of all remembrance neuer to be match'd With any Ghost or man except thy selfe: Who through abortiue hope didst match thy selfe: A man most worthy of all impious fame, Who Don Pheudippe cleaped was by name. Know (gallant sir) I did repose my life Vpon the friend-ship of that foolish man; Hee kept my soule betweene his Tyrant's armes Nay (let mee adde) the value of my Crowne, (For which some Kings would eu'n exchange their soule) Hee kept both Soule and Crowne betwixt his armes, Yet both lay open to excessiue harmes: O if I had election to dispend My fauour vpon such a Rogue as hee But once, once more; I'de locke my counsell vp And keepe my bosome secrets to my selfe. Lae. Kings may indeed depriue their Senate-house Of some pretence, and may (let others prate) Conceale affaires belonging to the State. Me. If hell affoorded such a menstruous ragge I'de re-conclile the error of my sence; But, now may reckon vp some woe-full verse For solid passion Poets best reherse. Lae. A Poets rapture Kings haue wish'd to feele Which some despise because vncapable. Me. The Muses make my braine their banquet-house, And thus with Lucan will wee frame our song Of dreaded horror, whose in-human rage Blew dire-full tempest through the Tharsall plaine Of lawes neglected, and a stubborne age Whose bloud &amp; black-deeds did their country staine Of ciuill discord, and a haplesse breach In Kingdomes couenant, which did sore impeach The worlds whole Confines, and their Publicke-weale Wee sing, and sternely treat how euery deale Standards met Standards, Ensignes were a-like, Bowes threatned Bowes, and nimble speares the Pike. (Romans) what madnesse may wee terme this strife? Be your owne blades let loose, against your life? That Nations farre remote should see and smile At your wide gaping wounds, and Rome reuile? And must your hot encounters carlesse boyle, When Babylon should perish in the spoyle Of her victorious Trophies? when the Ghost Of vnreuenged Crassus heere stood toss'd Aboue ground? then must war-like humors breath Which wanting triumph, want a worthy wreath. O and alas! what Kingdomes, what renowne This bloud might haue obtain'd? some temptiue Crowne, Where beautious Titan sleepes, and heauy night Exempts the ioyfull harbengers of light: Else where the sweltring noone-day scalds with heate, Else where continuall Winter takes her seate: Where Scythicke Pontus pierc'd with crazy cold Lyes bed-red on a cripple corner-moul'd, Ceres might conquer'd beene, Araxes yoak'd Had not domesticke warre such broiles prouok'd. If (Rome) thy battailes thou esteeme such blisse Subdue all Kings, then were it not amisse To combat with thy selfe; meane while breake of, For multitude of foes may freely scoffe. Om. Our King hath tasted iuice of Helicon. Me. Tasted? no foole, the Muses do entraunse My deere imagination, I will swim Through each sweete streame of rauish'd eloquence Of Passion, Satyre, AEglogue, Epigram Of Sonets, Imprecations, Epitaphes, And by them all admonish Mighty Kings To keepe their bosome lockt; for friendship stings.

Menander , Hypponax, Laelio, Evphorbvs, Hyarchvs. Go fetch a Garland from the Muses-groue For I will sit amongst the Sheep-heard Swaines Vpon some pretty tuft or pleasant hill Hung (in my honour) with fresh hallowed baies, And eccho forth an Alphabet of layes: My Queene, poore Queene, bereft of beauties pride Shall in our fancy sit and touch our side. Hy. Grieue not, she was my daughter (gratious King) Me. Gratious, and King, be words not knowne to mee; I am no King, nor will be gratious But an impartiall Poet of this age Who must inueigh at Kings and Kingly grace: I must a multitude of woes rehearse And stab my audience with I-ambicke verse: Raile at the peeuish humour of a slaue Whose rude examples be notorious. Attend my whole narration (royall Dukes) Remember how I did the Forrest rule, How I amongst the troupe of Elephants, Foxes, and Tygers, Apes, and Leopards, Was, by appointment of my fathers will Left as an heire legitimate, to liue And re-establish my true parents bloud: Remember and imagine I did rule Like an audacious Lyon of the lawnes, Who by mis-fortune haue caught a pricke Which doth distemper his presuming paw Meetes with a heart-lesse Pilgrime, doth salute His coward fancy with a peale of feares Then doth submit (some ceremonies done) His royall stoutnesse to the trembling man Puts forth his pained member, shewes the wound Till the distracted traueller con-ceiues A remedy to succour that which grieues: The Lyon thus allur'd with seeming loue Protects the Pilgrime by his noble force Doth not for-sake him, fawnes vpon the wretch Whose poore compulsiue cowardise did vrge That tributar alleageance (not his loue) Least life should answere what his will deny'd: Thus did they liue till the most faithlesse man Grew so familiar hee was not afear'd To shake the sleeping Lyon by the beard: Thus hee pretended still to be aboue So slew the Lyon for his Kingly loue. And thus, ô thus! did my Pheudippe deale: For from the dust and dunghill did I raise The needy fortunes of that naked man Without all merit, saue hypocrisy Which was my thanke for all his dignity: The Gods and you beare witnesse (noble friends) I took that fellow for the truest man That woman e're was bless'd with; did beleeue His birth and education both Deuine, Who was indeed a deuill; for whose death My brainelesse fury did blaspheme the Gods: O if I had election to for-sake The substance of my soules eternity, If soule and body did together die If deaths corruption could corrupt the soule, (So make it vanish, and auoide controule,) No speedy torment should escape, no death Be vn-attempted, till my life and breath Were as my soule is now, inuisible: O I would climbe Acro-seraunian rockes, Run to the top of Ætna, or the Alpes And rush downe head-long like a desperate slaue; Or like an Aiax, greedy of reuenge, I would in-counter Woules, and Vnicornes, Tempting the sauage worthies to assaile My carelesse life, and so in-counter mee. Ev. But sir, the soule of man is pretious, Made of immortall essence, cannot die. Me. So, I'me oppress'd with immortality, And though my rotten Carkasse soone decay Yet must my soule account for blasphemy: For Blasphemy, which I in zealous loue To a false lewd impostor did augment With sharpe invectiues eeu'n to vex the Gods. Hip. Your loue to that dissembler was extreme And all extremes beget extremities. Me. To that dissembler, to that deuil, say; To that Magitian, true-borne Impe of hell, Speake thus; and let mee thanke your eloquence; For had hee beene produc'd of earthly race His charmes and witch-craft could not so deceiue My narrow apprehension, ô attend! And I will make you weepe before I end. Pheudippe like a frozen viper was Whom, I (delighted with a formall shew) By chance tooke vp, and warmth and life bestow'd Vpon this piteous creature; till at length Hee crept and crawl'd into my bosome; I Did suffer still, through plaine simplicity, The serpent to become familiar; My table and my Trencher gaue him food, Still did I suffer, still hee slept and fed Vpon my trembling bosome; hee did kisse And licke my tender veines, as I did his: Still did I suffer, though my soundest friends Bad mee beware of such a subtle Guest, Giuing faire cautions to embrace the best; Still did I suffer, and did scourge aduice, With sharpe rebukes, not valewing the price. So long I sufferd, hee so long did sleepe, So long hee lick'd mee, and so long time crept, So long I lou'd him, hee so long time wept With false affection, as hee did confirme My not mis-doubting friend-ship, which was firme, But after all my loue, and all his teares, After my patience, and his creeping smiles, My long, long sufferance, and his thankefull vowes; After all these ô God, my bosome groanes To thinke, that after all such boundlesse good Hee wish'd to sucke vpon my royall bloud. Evp. The subtle wretch, in mischiefe, did reioyce, And was corrupted by the peoples voyce. Hya. True, they corrupt, whom they still hope to please The peoples physicke, doth enflame disease. Men. Foule vengeance choake the people, and their loue, They doe deiect whom they aduance aboue: The peoples suffrage, to a rising youth Is like their folly at a publicke Stage, Striuing to purchase a dumbe audience By multitude of clamour; they suppose Peace is engendred by still crying peâce, As if confusion did by murmure cease: So they imagine, by their open mouth, To make a Gyant, though but scarce a man: They speake him vertuous, bountifull, and wise Hoping polluted breath, might Canonize Whom they (with durty palmes) do seeme to raise, And bind his Temples with their stinking baies: No, they but make him dizzy, deafe, and mad, Whom they desire to make a demi-god; Their multitudes of clamour doe beget A most vn-cured swimming of the head; For so the rules of ringing do agree, Confusion euer spoiles a harmony. What Cox-combe now dares call Mænander mad? Doe not (I pray) abuse mee (noble boyes) Although I be a Poet; all men know I neuer writ of Cupids whirligig, Of amorous conceites, nor daliance, And iust so long as Poets will abstaine From foolish loue and Cupids Diety, The Poets Art is counted Piety. But if the tenor of a loue-sicke Theame Stuffe rotten Volumnes then the Author's mad, Or Moone-sicke, some iudicious booke-men, say, Though others, amid' earnest, allow play. Evp.

Open thy case if it bee parallel, Let's liue co-partners in some vgly shade Where none but melancholy night-rauens keepe There let's complaine, but (breath being silent) weep. Not farre from hence, low in a humble Caue, My little cottage stands deuoide of care Finely en-compass'd with a pleasant waue Drest vp with Daisies, Cow-slips, Hyacinths And many thousand pretty, pretty things Which Nature lends me while the black-bird sings: Foure Goats I haue which browze vpon the twigs, Two did relinquish mê, for I had six, One seem'd a Lambe which was indeed a Wolfe, Him did my dog discouer, kill, and eate— Ev. Wee doe discouer all thy weakenesse King To helpe is hard, to weepe an easy thing. Me. Dares then thy blistredtongue (audacious foole) Forget all duty and disturbe a Duke? (Impudent Asse) I do degrade thy eares And thee, from all imployment; be an Asse At large, and carry loaues, like Lucius Deserue a Cudgell and a biting spurre, Be dull and sluggish in extremities Till I bestow a Rose or any thing To make thy suddaine metamorphosis. Ev. It's made already (King) and I will kisse Your dainty palme, then laugh, and Poetize Cast of my robe and act old Lucius, Or Messala Coruino; daunce I will, And after sixty Summers will I doate So, change my garment for a mimickes coate: Captiues repine at their compulsiue thrall Who then (sweete Mistresse) may me Captiue call? Though conquer'd I confesse Yet voide of heauinesse: For-bearance makes my freedome At length to bee more welcome. When with compassion thou shalt pitty Mee; or approue my harmelesse Ditty: If ransome you require Tell mee thy chiefe desire; What is it I would not giue thee? Make triall and beleeue mee. Ransome though you refuse Or at the least excuse Yet to the latest of a thousand liues I will reioyce in loue, triumph in giues. Om. Age is become a yong in-amorate. Me. Laugh, laugh, infernall furies leape for ioy; Make mee a flaming Chariot, I will ride Vpon the wings of potent Lucifer, And flie, like lightning, through th'amazed Orbe. Thunder shall be my Page, and Æolus Leade vp my Coach-horse to big Titans Hall, Where in that faire Assembly of the Gods, Glistering with golden robes Pontific all: I must a volume of large thankes recite, And a petition to dame Luna write: All, for thy sweete acquaintance Messala Whom I adore, and much will dignify Those who pertake in rauish'd lunasy. Ev. So, then wee are companions (lusty ladde.) Me. Till daring Ioue dissolue the Vniuerse, Till the last reuolution of this Orbe. Ev. Till Cittizens accounted ciuill knaues, To cheating custome be no longer slaues. Me. Till sage authentickes of vn-spotted liues Leaue baudy Panderisme to their willing wiues. Ev. Then, faith til Courtiers too, with satten sleeues Renownce all begging and be arrant theeues. Me. Till Taylors like-wise made of shreds and shelues Enrich the debtor to vn-doe themselues. Evp.

Speake (damned vermin) each true accent tell For wee'le vn-rip thy bosome spight of hell; Speake thou contemptuous varlet, doe not striue And shake thy limbs with vn-expressed feare, For (trembling slaue) my hand shall catch thy haire, Hold thee perforce, with chaines of adamant, Till thy audacious shadow quaking seeth, If hands be weary I can hold by teeth. Man. But ô Iudicious— Me. Villaine I abhorre The hatefull sound of thy be-witching voyce, Keepe in thy clamorous eccho (coniurer) And cease with Magicke to enchant our sence Or I will sindge thy beard off with my breath: O you damn'd fawning Rascall, canst thou shake And tremble after all thy infamy?

O pacifye great King.— Me. —Your yawning voice With a full concord of my furious palme If you produce another syllable You most notorious caitife, you mad curre, Thou Polititians dog, did I aduance Thy ragged fortunes to degrade my selfe, Make thee a partner of my Kingdomes ioy Giue thee my Kingdomes pleasure, wealth, and wiues, When I (made foolish) to make thee as King Tooke the bare title and a glorious heape Of golden sorrow requisite for Kings, Keeping the best (by priuiledge) for thee Without a second riuall? thus I did, Nay, did I thus and yet thou proue vnkind? I call my faith in question to demand Such need-lesse truth, for thou didst proue vnkind, Contriuing the subuersion of my rule Which gaue a perfect essence to thy soule, Submit, submit for shame, and say forgiue: Say but forgiue and I am gratious. Man. I am not (sacred King) as you suppuse The tortur'd Ghost of that in-glorious man Pheudippe, sunke below the verge of hell.

Tell mee Mantesio, why didst talke of curse, Discarded woe, and vexing misery? Man. Of all I tasted in extremity. Me. Liues there that soule vpon the spacious globe, Which doth vprightly thinke it can deserue Extremity of sorrow, heapes of woe As did Pheudippe? it's impossible: No (good old man) though thy large multitude Of capitall offences do exceed, The wandring starres, I may account thee cleane, Like a religious innocent, or babe, As a bright Angell, to Pheudippe's shame. Man. Yet am I poore, and will partake in woe: Me. Canst be distracted? melancholicke? mad? Sweare by the beauty of the burning Zone? Looke like a dead-mans scull, most scirvily? Laugh, weepe, raile, sweare, and hang thy selfe at once? Rend off thy pleated haire, be lunaticke? Liue naked in a tempting wildernesse? Call mee Don Aiax? liue by roots and hearbes? Be a true male-content? be ever sad? Cloudy, like Christmas? be dis-consolate? And (aboue all) renounce society? If thus thou canst obserue a dogged change, If gloomy sorrow (made excessiue strange) Stab thy distracted senses to the life, Wee may dispatch all sence without a knife. But who comes heere? Lae. A Poet (pretious sir) Me. Thy name? Pe. Perillus. Me. O aduance thy tune, Provoke thy sharpe Melpomene to sing The story of a begger and the King. Canst command Poems vn-præmedite? Per. I haue a little smacke of poesie, Can smell the amber-breath that rapture brings, Vpon receit of which my consort sings. Me. But I haue bedded the faire Muses nine, Slept in the bosome of Melpomene, Haue rid vpon the wings of Pegasus, Drunke downe a floud of sparkling Hyppacren, Keepe a perpetuall moisture in my head, Hating such dilatory sloth of men, From whose weake braines the rotten papers shed, Like leaues in autumne; I account him quicke Who is by nature so; with small intent Such (as my selfe) may be proficient: I could now turne conceited stagerite, And represent I will, with feeling straines, The Ghost of Crassus, or cracke all my vaines: Suppose me then the Ghost of that old man, That sorry man, my ribs trans-fix'd with steele, Or with a tempest of the Scythian darts, My wounded carkasse blacke with bloody gore, Long steep'd in frosty stuper, to arise, With squallid rayment from the waues of hell, And vnto Pompei apparitions tell: Will you great Pompei, patron of my cause, Who didst by solemne oath, vowfull revenge? Will you, the comfort of my funerals, Tombe to my ashes, and my naked bones? Will you, will Pompei proue delinquent? hee, Who hath in loue to Crassus, threatned stabs, Death and destruction till deepe wounds increase, Can hee loue Crassus foe, and seeke for peace? Bleed then my gaping and forgotten wounds Bleed eu'n afresh, or let my frozen blood, Like a congealed sirrop, now dissolue, After such cloudy seasons of the yeare, Such heauy sorrow, and such doubtfull feare: After so many dismall nights and dayes, So many tempests of the Stygian Barke, And prophesie, things fatall, true, but darke: Calamity made famous by extreames Erected in a marble monument, Shall by her often meeting vexe thy minde, Else by opposed number make thee blinde: Horror and ruine (Pompei) shall affront Thy shamelesse fortunes, thy fowle negligence, Cities at thy sub-uersion shall reioyce The sculs and trophies of thy captaines losse The victor shall vpon his raueling tosse; Where swift Euphrates, sent such worthy names To blacke oblivion, and the tumbling waues Of big-swolne Tygris, cast my carkasse dead Vpon the margent of that muddy shore, And gaue to earth what Neptune could not keepe, Hauing once cast my wounded limbes asleepe: There shall thy woe approach, and Pompei know If quicke avoidance bee not difficult, Thou then more easely mightst attone the strife Which thy proud factious Nephew hath begun, Raging amid the heart of Thessaly. Thinke but a while vpon the Roman orbe, Thinke of thy friends at home, thinke who they are, And those few friends with watchfull foes compare: Thinke yet of Ægypt, her seuen-headed gulfe, Ioyne with Ægyptian Ptolomei, and thriue, His high tuition appertaines to thee, Tender his nonage, aime at Ægypts throne, Whose King hath but the shadow of a name, Because a childish infant, lacking fame, And feare, (the substance of a Diademe) Nor thinke the old allegeance to their kings, Can so estrange the peoples loue to thee, But know the state of kingdomes be most milde, If, or, the King is new, or is a childe: Both do concurre to crowne thy happinesse, Set saile for Ægypt, make thy couenant there, Oppose the Parthi, and depopulate The fields, where Crassus did enioy his fate: Say, from the cinders of a slaughered man, You tooke aduice to turne Ægyptian. Pe. Most liuely acted, and like Roscius. Lae. Hee doth pronounce with volubility. Man. For a pure copious linguist hee doth well, But for ingenious action doth excell. Evp.

Goe digge for wit whilst I am Ioviall, And laugh and leape among my flatterers, Come daunce Lavoltoes my familiar knaues, Do you commend this mirth? Om. Most happily. Per. Mirth may expell distraction, if secûre. Me. But ô my friend, I am not as I seeme, Merry indeed, but onely seeming so; Vn-rip my bosome, and with lines of blood Deeply ingrau'd vpon my trembling heart, You may discerne attractiue Epitaphs, The shamefull curse of a contemptuous King, A loue-knot double broken; and by whom Friendship rewarded with extreame abuse; False-hood, without a colour, and excuse. Pe. What flinty flesh could now abstaine from teares? Me. Do then thy stranger thoughts compassionate, And weepe at our in-humane destiny. If thy relenting heart true passion feele, Then let thy moist'ned loue some drops distill; Weepe on (my friend) I cannot I controule The copious fountaine; for a silent teare Doth apprehend the quicke; but neuer howle: Forsake mee now, and leaue me desolate, I would revolue the lessons of my state. Scœn. 4. The Ghost Of Phevdippe , Menander. Vp from earths lodging, and those rotten sculs, Buried in embers till the earth awake, Wrapt in my funerall-ashes, safe reseru'd, I doe arise from rude antiquity, To begge but pardon as a mid-nights almes, Feeling the horror of my fault immence, Which doth exceed in nature all offence. I come (Mænander.) Me. Who Mænander cal's? What hidden Diuell dares molest my muse? Phe. Denounce thy iudgement with a milder tune, I come (Mænander.) Me. Death to my soule! what comes? Who comes? or how do'st come? inuisible? Ph. I come with meeknesse. Me. Why, or whence dost come? Damnation ouertake thee, what's thy name? Shadow of Stygian horror! what's thy name? (Intruder) know thy distance, keepe aloofe, Come not within sixe yards, vpon the price And perill of an vn-avoided charme: By which, and thousand other potent spels, The magicke Herball, oyntments, numbers odde, By trans-mutations, mid-nights, Incubus, Squint-ey'd Ericthon, soule of Hecate, I doe con-iure thee, tell, and not mistake, How fares Pheudippe of the Stygian lake? Phe. O I am hee, a spirit of despaire, Compact (by Ioues decree) of cloudy aire. I am the wretch, who was in life, a span; But in excesse of crime, a crooked man. Me. Blesse the good stars aboue, thou guilty theefe Which doe in-close thee with a robe of clouds, Spight of protection else, and coats of steele, The tempest of my passion thou shouldst feele; Thunder and lightning should not dare with-stand To take due vengeance from my fatall hand. Phe. My tortures be aboue thy humane gesse, The torment of my soule who may expresse? My comforts now be multitudes of paine, Viewing a number infinite of soules, Which stuffe the dampish pit with piercing howles, Restlesse they tumble, hoping to get ease, And, more they moue, out-rage doth more increase. Wee raile at our conception, curse the skye, And in the face of heau'n spit blasphemy. Wee all enioy a most impatient curse, Yet all suppose our owne paine still the worse; Motion doth vexe vs, sitting still doth vexe, Torment, no age escapes, no sumptuous sexe: Me. Did thy ambitious height incurre all this? Phe. My falshood, flattery, and a Courtiers life, (The fountaines to all sorrow) did infect My soule with disease vn-curable. Me. I doe indeed forgiue thee, therefore tell Compassion to the Purseuant of hell; Say I forgiue thee, and on that dis-charge, Command the crabbed Iaylor to in-large Thy long and lowlie thraldome; often say I doe forgiue thee (false vngracious man) O often-times repeat, the King forgiues, Often repeat, as an exemplar thing, Thou hast obtain'd forgiuenesse of a King, For a tall gyant-error, an offence Made monstrous bigge by circumstance; contempt In a degree aboue comparison; Yet I forgiue those capitall crimes done: If thou attainted be with some offence, Equall in nature to this high contempt, Goe then, accurs'd, till I redeeme thee, goe Accounted worthy of damnations woe: But, because officers do sting like bees, Say I forgiue thee, and will pay thy fees. Few plaintifes, or appellants doe the like, Though I without a iudgement will release Errors escap'd from youth, soliue in peace. Phe. But I am past repentance (royall sir) And so thy pardon is like bounty giuen To beggers dead, or med'cines ill-bestow'd On separated members, like vaine life Purchas'd by seales and writings after death, And execution of a guilty theefe; There's no capacity for dead reliefe, Kings, clad with numerous titles, cannot giue Promethean fire, to make a dead man liue: Pardon of Kings no benefite may deale, Except it passe by a superiour seale: Surfets and rupture, to be dumbe, and blinde; Acknowledge Art; but surfets of the minde And rupture in affections forcing ill, Know none aboue, but a free gouern'd will: Which if it proue re-misse, mans powerfull fate Carries him head-long to my damn'd estate; The ship-wrack'd Pilot may discerne a shelfe, But euery foole vn-cheated, cheats himselfe: Aduance thy pale desires, looke fresh and big, Thinke on revenge, cleare thy contracted brow, Be sensible of wrong, and (worthy) know My false co-partners liue, who did conspire, And frame the bellowes of ambitious fire: Amilcar liues (my sonne) Lucilla liues (Thy subtill sister) old Mantesio liues: All my adhærents, all competitors In mischiefe, most well-knowne conspirators; Yet all suruiue in safety, traytors liue; Thinke on revenge, I doe aduise thee well; Sleepe not vpon thy proiects, if thou want Opinion of a friend, heare mee a supplicant: Levell inuention with a speedy aime, Till thou the cunning of such knaues reclaime. Me. My sister false? Amilcar such a knaue? Who indeed is, but is affections slaue? Ph. And none but him, iudgements incounter can, Although aspersions touch the honest man. Remember these my motiues, morning peepes, The day no dilatory time doth giue, To eccho forth at large, thy Queene doth liue. Me. Doth Fauorina liue? deere shadow stay, Phe. My absence is enforc'd through rising day. Me. Split then in peeces thou pernitious toade, My plagues deminish to augment thy load. My Queene sur-viue? ioynt-cause of all my woe? Of all my anger, blasphemy and rage? Is shee reseru'd? doth Fauorina liue? Whose absence made me raile at Cinthia? O I haue swallow'd poyson, which torments All my distracted veines with agony, A griefe continuing without all re-lease, Consumption of my paine breeds paines increase. Now for ob-noxious compounds to possesse The soule with euerlasting lethargy, Ransome of thousand Kings would I exchange, Or like a beast, humanity estrange. O for inchanted Poppei, or the iuice Of drunken Hemlocke, to lay soules asleepe, I'de like a Serpent on our belly creepe, Licking each humble shrub, and carelesse feed Vpon the stubble of each stinking weed. Shreike ô the mid-night-mandrakes voyce aloud, So may the horror of that piercing sound, Turne soule and body both alike to ground: Pel-mel together my affections fight, Each conquer each, some scudd away by flight. Scœn. 5. Amilcar. Coynes and Lust, arch-enemies to loue, Combat apace within my youthfull bloud; Feare to attempt my vn-experienc'd wish, Tels me with what a coy and constant face The Queene will start in motiues of my lust; (For I no better Title can bestow On our audacious meaning) lust abounds, Free from all apprehension of that loue Which simple-meaning youths do still protest And vow to virgin-chastity; but I, Who am inflam'd with ambiguity Will not imbarque a faithlesse vow so farre As evaporate promise, which infects Beyond fierce natures lust, and stabs my fame: Because rich Nature, although couetous, Loth to conferre a full satiety Of goodnesse, vpon me her suppliant, Hath yet impos'd one vertue aboue all, In promise euer to disdaine the breath, Though strict obseruance do my weale impeach: Yes, I preferre the violent attache Of maiden-head, before false promises; For (all can witnesse) rape's a thing in act, So there's an end; We never doe dissemble, Nor do extinguish sparkes of sanctity With fraud, with vn-supported periury, (Ioyning ranke false-hood to concupiscence) Protesting marriage to enioy a smacke, And so deceiue the long desirous wombe Of hop'd fruition: A hot rauisher Giues what the wombe would otherwise demand: Yet will I not enrage my lust so farre, As violence to wrong the beauteous Queene, If shee (as women will) proue plyable, Nor will engage on oath to assevêre What I disdaine, yoak'd-marriage; for indeed, Women be clogs which hang about the necke Of man, so heauy till it sometimes breake: A well-couch'd theame of loue shall therefore try If without promise I may mount on high: The bonds of marriage I abhorre to chuse, And rather would vpon such points refuse The noble Queene (if to accomplish it Were possible) then happily enioy: Seeing nature doth demand variety, Admitting which, with full saciety, Health is impeach'd, and many men made poore, Who hauing honest wiues will hugge a whoore. Scœn. 6. Amilcar , Gracchvs. Speake, is she made of waxe (sollicitor?) Gr.

Ami. I burne the rather, and by rape will quench My lustfull famine, were she Ioues owne wench. Gra. O doe not offer head-strong violence; Delay makes modest women more propense. Am. Death &amp; damnations plague to boot! how long Must I abstaine (you smooth-tongu'd flatterer) Till doomes-day? doe not vrge my flaming wrath, Least you provoke a Lyon to the spoile. By Cupids Sacraments of lust and loue, I will no more delay (thou lazy dogge) Dost trifle? speake forbearance, and delay? I doe begin to be suspitious Of thy proceedings: tell vs of delay? No, as the Faulcon doth a Phesant seize, I will both seize vpon her (prating daw) And trusse her vp in my Imperious claw. (Sirrah) rememer, I did giue you meate, Clothes, coine, and such good poore commodities, When you were quite blowne vp with gamesters lucke, Ragges and fowle linnen, scabbes and sciruy lice, The quicke associates of all cheating dice, Did honestly begin to set vp house In your old single suit, 'pray do not make Mee a disseisor of francke-tenements, By tortious dealing with your free-holders, Who had a better Title then my selfe If you do proue vn-thankfull; so consider. Gra. Am I vp-braided? noble sir I thanke The bounteous almes you lent my bare estate, And I as freely doe desclaime desert, As you did freely giue them; yet in-faith I was not lowsie (Lord) consider well, Though Lords be lowsie too sometimes; if hell Heau'n, earth, and men, be not so gratious, As to conceale infirmities of state. Am. Say I am lowsie sir. Gra. Can pox forbid? But I must giue him better language now: No (my respected sir) I dare not taxe Especiall favorites, of lice or poxe, 'Mongst whom you are the chiefe, but milky skin That hath faire out-sides, may be fowle within. And I againe do in despight averre, Voidance of lice from our natiuity. Reclaime then that aspersion (Lord) and know I was not lowsie, but like mid-night snow, Pure, when thy selfe (now seeking to supplant) Took'st me to rescue from the iawes of want: I was not lowsie (Lord) looke bigge and burst, I will maintaine my credit, though accurst. Ami. You were not lowsie (knaue) not ragged, no Nor sicke, I condiscend; yet sirrah know The plagues of Ægypt all began to march Full-mouth vpon thee (like devouring dogges Ready enough to rend a breathlesse Fox) When I with noble pitty being oppress'd, Flew forth like lightning to thy rescu'd life, Which is indeed my proper donatiue. Do not reply thou true insulting toade, Squint-ey'd caitife, you pernitious rat, You golded rascall, you most lowsie rogue: Do not reply, mad mastife, do not swell, And thinke (because you can discouer well My trickes of youth) to stop the feruent rage Of our vn-tam'd affections; future age Must, and shall, witnesse my fierce violence, If thou discouer but one syllable; Nay, if thou entertaine a peece of thought. Which by vn-masking mee doth hope revenge: Sweare, sweare (you thick-lip'd rascal) kindly sweare Without compulsion, or base-minded feare, To be like mid-night, as a sepulchre, Dumbe as a Turkish executioner, Nay, as a marble statue, void of signes Touching the substance of my secresie. Sweare (slaue) and thinke my soule a fury mad, Able to force wide rupture through the face Of threatning Horror to endamage thee; As to demand account of periury. Do not seeme loath, expecting new delay; For I can stab you (capon) to the quicke, Cut off your Eunuch-nose, then laugh and kicke Your lowsie stinking neats-iowle to the dogges. Gra. Without collusion I do strictly sweare. Am. And thinke withall, I who haue coine bestow'd, Clothes, and faire countenance, with store of meat, Can also giue sharpe sawce, which will procure Digestion to the stomacke, else (proud sir) You will dis-gorge the vomit in my face; If kindnesse do recoyle, let feare take place: Gra. I am your foot-stoole, tread vpon my teeth, And so charme silence if you do mis-doubt. Ami. No, but remember if you shall bewray My darke designments, or vse cheating play In prosecution of my priuate cause, (Hoping for payment from the Spartan lawes) Remember that thy life, and interest Of being rich, both owe a speciall rent With homage, and knight-seruice vnto me, Remember you do hold in Capite. Gra. Cut then my seruile tongue out of my head, Slit my suspected organs, make me dumbe, Handlesse and sighlesse if you thinke me false, For I must otherwise be false indeed: Men that admonish to auoid some vice, Must not inculcate motiues more then thrice; Pupils much tutor'd with Identity Of reprehension, proue but spur-gall Iades; Because they thinke the vitious estate Of things habituall, doe argue fate, Which to resist, they thinke impiety, Exclude me therefore from society Of human habitants, or leaue to vex, Which is a torment to all human sexe. Ami. I leaue addition, but consider well, You are as deepe ingag'd almost as I; Which depth, of both ingagements, reach to hell, If any (but our selues) the depth espy. Gra. Sir, I haue broke the Ice to Appetite, And with a studied phrase did I begin, Hoping to thaw the coldest frosty North By representing multitude of feares. Am. And did she melt? Gr.

Fa. Did you for this (most lying impious man) Pull me from refuge and protection safe? Giue me aduice, in hope of due reuenge, To follow thee, forsake the Title Queene Of Sparta, to become a Queene of Lust? For this did you sollicite (beastly Lord?) And labour by this talking Eunuch-bawd, To conquer chastity through faithlesse fraud? For this did you obtest high oathes aboue My poore conceit, to shew dissembling loue? Ami. Let me againe obtest the waking Gods, Or (beyond them) your beauteous diety, (Which to abuse, were vild impiety) Thy glad fruition were a ransom'd soule, Or kingdomes conquest in my rich account Of glorious beauty; giuing more content Then soule, imagine, or great kingdomes may. Wee call to witnesse thy imperious hate, And do appeale to vertue of thy loue, (If hate and loue may both together lodge) Thy loue surmounts my value, doth infuse A sudden rapture to my longing soule, Doth change dull nature, quicken vp my braine, Put a perfume into my sordid breath, And is indeed restoratiue to death. Fa. If you intend a true religious loue, Professe it sir, without offence to Ioue, And so remember blessed nuptials; For hee enioyes his fate and funerals, Who sometime was Mænander, and my spouse; Your selfe did seale his death by constant vowes. Speake then, and let thy answere be direct, Or I shall thinke, religion you neglect Gra. O shee hath giuen his fury a full stab, My sweet-mouth'd Courtier swallows downe a crab. The Eele is in a sand-bagge, some good man See how the mimicke serues an Alphabet Of hungry faces, how the maggot crawles To feed vpon the kernell. Fa. Who replyes? Gra. Againe, againe (for loues sake) spur the Iade: Giue him another pill, provoke the slaue, And make him spue his heart with madnesse; melt His larded veines with striving to extend A lowsie answere; but the Idoll speakes. Fa. What makes Amilcar dumbe with my request? What makes thy trembling blood so pale and wanne, Most like the colour of a dying man? Am. The sad remembrance of my foolish vow, Vexes meeke apprehension; yeelding forth In stead of answere, ambiguities. Gra. Looke for a subtill rare-compacted lye. Ami. Madam, the vow makes mee monasticall, I haue protested a true single life, Which did ingender a Dilemma, long, But religious indeed. Gra. Ridiculous, Indeed you are a Goat libidinous. Ami. I neuer will be yoak'd, by consequence No drawing beast, no big laborious oxe, I must not marry madame. Fav. Must you then (Because not marry, to auoyd the oxe) Liue like a noted and eggregious Asse? Or like a Cammell, fierce with flaming lust? Would you seduce my weaker innocence? Seeke to intrap my credulous conceit? You must not marry; would you then defile The modest thoughts of virgin-chastity? Would you take licence from a single life, To make each maid a whore, not being a wife? I blush to view such vild affinity, Betwixt a Goatish beard, and bearded men. Ami. But be familiar (Madam) and re-call I was a target once to thee condemn'd, Both by Lucilla, and Pheudippe's doome; Remember Madam, I did turne the edge Of quicke Lucilla's wrath vpon her selfe, Tooke thy confiscate beauty from the snare Of imminent sub-version, drew thee out As from a gulfe which gaping, ready stood To swallow downe thy honor, sing thy hurt, So change thy golden dignity to durt. I did (remember Madam) banish hate, For I did wrestle with vp-rising fate. Fav. You did infranchise my condemned life, You did returne Lucilla's point of spleene Vpon her wicked bosome; whence it came; You (sir) did manage my neglected cause, Tooke my confiscate beauty from the snare Of imminent sub-version; you did this; You, you haue beene my target, you alone Drew my forgotten safety from the teeth Of tugging dangers; you alone did this; And did you this to amplifie abuse? Did you reserue my innocence for this? For this did you protect my ignorance? You kept my carkasse from a rampant Woolfe, To feed your tame, but hungry, Lyons whelpe: You did preuent a neere captiuity, To make my thraldome be notorious; You, from a guiltlesse danger, did redeeme My maiden thoughts, to make the danger, guilt; Thou gau'st new being ('bout too faile before) After which being, must I be thy whore? Faith you haue done a deed of charity, Tooke mee by rescue, from death past the chin, To rip my pregnant wombe, and flea my skin. But know (Amilcar) I am so resolu'd Vpon the spot-lesse loue of chastity, As I with proper violence will rend My wombe in peeces, teare my tempting face And go beyond a womans forritude, Rather then (like a Strumpet) prostitute. Ami. (Queene) I contemne your points of chastity, Laugh at such idle trickes to colour sinne: You are a captiue in my custody, Consider well the law of time and place Be at my proper nod; if naked lust Bribe mee to some in-iustice, doe not blame A smooth acceptance; for the frugall age Wherein I liue, doth barke aloud for fees Which in themselues be bribes; if to the knees, Or necke, some rascall knaue be drench'd in bloud, The scarlet can absolue a scarlet sinne And call deepe slaughter a correctiue deed. Then blame the bribes which did in-iustice feed, Blame not the man (I pray;) so blame our lust Not mee Amilcar, if enioy wee must. Fa. Haue you decreed some rauisher's attempt? Will you determine to be violent? A dead pale horror doth possesse thy cheeke With repetition of the simple sound; Thou violate a virgins chastity? Canst thou commit an odious rape, a sinne Of such high out-rage; yet looke pale and dead Vpon recitall of the sinne it selfe? Amil. Nip mee (good Gracchus) how? looke pale and dead? Fetch Aqua-fortis (Gracchus) stab my arme, A shaking palsie doth oppresse my heart; How? pale, and dead? Gra. (Wise woman) I adore The quicke inuention, and if Gods agree Will in despight of false-hood set her free. Fa. O what damn'd terrour to a wicked man Be guilty thoughts, considering offence (Fitly compar'd to prodigall expence:) Nor may the valiant'st sinnefull youth aliue With resolution so in-wal'd appeare But his high heart will be below his feare. Can you commit lewd rape (Amilcar?) no: Maids, and chaste women need no more defence For hot inuasion, except innocence. Earnest resistance, by but one true maide, Will make the fiercest rauisher afraid: For if a virgin violate you see Shee did in part deny, in part agree: Firme resolution of a maidens hand, Tall Gyant-letchers, cannot halfe with-stand. Ami. Take her (good Gracchus) to your custody Be thou my bawd, and purge Phlebotomy. Scœn. 8. Menander , Evphorbvs, Laelio, Perillvs, Bvfo, Lvcilla, Mantesio.

Secûred hope, and heauen can witnesse too I haue no biting bosome-snake which gnawes With greedy vulture-teeth and stinging iawes Vpon the pretious comfort of my soule; No second In-mate ready to controule Our quiet actions; no loud fearefull sinne To stab mee in the midst of honest mirth And ouer-looke the musicke of my minde, To make mee start and rob mee of content No, no (good Gracchus) I am innocent, And therefore not excluded from the helpe Of heauens tuition; know I dare affront Amilcar in the fury of his flames, Raile at the stubborne youth, and make him melt Eeu'n like a leaden statue, or indeed Like some obdurate image caru'd of Ice, Which through one blast of lightning doe despaire And from tall statues vanish into aire: I feele within mee such true noble signes Of earnest courage, as no female thought Can (except pure and pious) well compare: I am not valiant, like a drunken whore, Ramping by vertue of abused wine; Nor is my resolution desperate, I am not fearelesse, to see feare abound But innocence is resolutions ground. Gra. Will you neglect my counsell to escape? Will your deluded loue to innocence Not reckon meanes ordain'd for innocence? Protection doth imply our vigilance, Else vertue is reputed arrogance; Honest and simple hearts alone deserue That in extremitie pure holinesse Should make meanes thriue, not without good meanes, blesse. (Madam) I sweare they lacke humanity Who will teach men to tempt their destiny; Beleeue it (Fauorina) I should feare The doubtfull mercy of a hungry Beare: They who desire to feele the Lyons paw May liue in compasse of the Lyons Caue; I know good meanes, neglected, make a slaue. Fa. (Gracchus) I once againe commend your zeale Thanke, and admit your loue, which labours well To win the heigth of our capacity: But (Gracchus) tell mee now, suppose I stay, Suppose Amilcar doe continue still, Like a wilde Satyre, most libidinous; Admit hee shall extend so farre as rape And by the ruine of our modest grace Erect a shamefull Priapus in place? Tell mee (good Gracchus) what rich victory Can the foole boast of? what egregious act Can hee ascribe to conquest of our sex? Wee are alas like wals vn-fortified, Or like a Castle made of March-pane wals Easely subdu'd, without fierce rauishment. Women were made to make rash men repent. Shame to my fortunes, I did seeke reuenge And sure the Gods will turne reuenge on mee; Lucilla's death, the Kings Catastrophe Might haue bene both auoided, if reuenge And malice had not bene so force-able To banish pitty from our spightfull brest, The want of which procur'd a funerall chest To keepe the cinders of a sleeping paire; Which losse, no time can proue, no age repaire: Lucilla's death had my malicious doome As Epitaph to dead Mænanders Tombe; The plaintiffs lye which prou'd Lucilla's death Did like-wise rob Mænander of his breath. Gra. (Madam) you are deluded; I can giue A testimoniall that both doe liue. Fa. Mænander liue? and doth Lucilla liue? Speake it againe, proclaime the newes aloud Let heauen and earth be witnesse to thy tale: Speake it againe (good Gracchus) giue the Gods Notice againe of my certificate Which makes mee in a glorious estate: Dance my deiected soule, sing merrily Leape all my organs, I am innocent, Gracchus will witnesse, I am innocent, I did not kill Mænander, not accuse My riuall yong Lucilla, no (good heau'n) Gracchus will witnesse I am innocent: Lucilla liues, my best Menander liues, Speake it againe (good Gracchus.) Gr. both do liue. Fa. Beare witnesse now; hearke heauen, he said they liue Take speciall notice of his name and words For hee is prompt enough to iustify Our depositions, neither will hee lye: No, hee's an honest, very honest man Is called Gracchus so inscribe his name; And set his certaine testimoniall Vpon record: Lucilla doth suruiue And my Mænander hee is yet aliue: So saith good Gracchus, so inscribe the same. Ioy hath no passage through my rauish'd soule: I did before put on a painted face Forging false colour to my innocence But now indeed am truely innocent: Thou Gracchus be my iudge, and heau'n be iudge I am not now defil'd with bloudy thoughts And fearefull agues; thou be like-wise iudge That false Amilcar is a menstruous ragge, A youth ranke-rotten, before mellow-ripe: Flye-blowne already as a carkasse hot Which hath no shelter from the dog-day Sunne: Beyond all vertues cunning to reclaime: Goodnesse and reformation bee to him Monsters in nature; and detested more, Then of a Hermite is the common-whore. Vices, like Maggots, creepe on him so thicke, As who destroies the one, hee must not sticke To follow the sub-version of them both: Of lewd Amilcar and his lustfull growth. Gra. Who can escape the lime-twigs which are set By loose affections to ensnare himselfe? Man doth about him carry watchfull foes And must be carefull to in-counter those; For all without him, though by troups they come Cannot offend, who is in peace at home: Amilcar (Madam) is now riding post Vpon exact imployments; his returne Is doubtfull, therefore to auoid delay, The loue and duty of my zeale obey. A friend in whom I claime full interest Doth giue attendance to accompany Your Grace, till I can trusse a fardell vp And follow. Fa. What's thy friend? Gr. A Fencer. Gla. I am ingag'd vpon fidelity And must preserue you from hostility, Eeu'n to the latest of a mortall life, I will defend thee widdow, maide, or wife. Fa. My new redemption is a doubtfull taske, You both doe promise more then I will aske: And though my squint-ei'd fortune looke ascaunce Yet heau'n will succour my deliuerance: Which being once purchas'd, proud Amilcars lust Shall vanish into Salamanders dust. Gra. Put on the wings of speed; flie fast away I follow (Madam) before peeping day. Scœn. 2. Gracchvs , Amilcar, Servi. Successe attend her, till I soone dispatch And speedily escape Amilcars rage: Saddle my horse, and fetch my Caskets, hoe, Seruants make ready I must ride to Athens. All men desirous to preuent quicke fate Scorne (aboue all things) to procrastinate: Watch there without, like busy centinels And of my Lords returne, see some fore-tels.— Ser. Hee is return'd already; doth approach, Saith you may trauaile in his new Caroch. Gra. Yes, to the diuell; death! is hee return'd? I am vndone, I am vndone; (good genius) Helpe mee; (good Angels) be auspicious, Or I shall perish past recouery: Senge mee some lightning, though in-visible; O burne my bleeding heart; consume, consume! Flye from my nosthrils an infectious fume! Stop all my organs, ô commisserate The bad mis-fortune of a poore estate: Hee comes, hee comes— Am. (Gracchus my deere) how dost? What answere makes my Goddesse? doth shee melt? Doth she recant and aske my pardon? speake. Gra. No: I am troubled with a falling rhume. Ami. Fetch forth Pigmalions Image, I will doate, And so become Cupids Idolater: Stay Gracchus, wee will both accompany Her sacred passage to the publicke aire: What shaking palsie doth detaine thy steps? Where is the Queene? speake (trembling coward) speake. Gra. She ouer-came mee with incessant teares; To those I yeelded, ô forgiue my feares. Am. Yeelded? (base caitife) be our hopes all dead? My labour, lyes, delusion, studied care, All turn'd to smoake through yeelding of a drudge? All our ingagements, my beneuolence, My proiects, aimes, and large gratuities, All come to this? the center of my thoughts, My double trickes, and cunny-catching slights, All come to this? the rich fælicity Whereon my faith was grounded, come to this? Come gastly horror to consummate all, Adde ruine like-wise to my wit-lesse fall. O my loud curse! delusion was my baite And I am now deluded; learning failes; No new inuented stratageme auailes; And vertue I am not accquainted with. O you damn'd rogue, 'tis holliday at home, You hope the Queene (sir) will aduance you high, And hope so still, but (very, very knaue) I will dis-ioint your eleuated hopes; And make you (sir) an Alcibiades: The Queene departed? Gra. Pitty did preuaile, For shee did weepe, nor did of passion faile: Her eyes (good Lady!) did with weeping smart, Which made mee giue her licence to depart. Ami. I am vndone (you fragment) I'me vndone, I am detected, whither shall I runne? The haruest of my long laborious toyle, Now I haue swom through death and swallow'd fire, Giu'n doubtfull fury a most braue repulse Put backe suspence, and all approaching feares Almost concluded things impossible; Made smooth my way, and tilted in the face Of frowning mischiefe ready to take place; Now, now is all sub-verted; I am lost In a large Wood, a winding laborinth: I am excluded from all natiue power, Am like the rubbish of a ruin'd Tower; I am abus'd, I am to death betrai'd, By thee a doctor villaine; not afrai'd To sweare mee homage, and vn-lace my heart: The blessings of your body, breath, and soule Be so engag'd, as their existence knowes Not one redeemer among all the Gods, (Fabulous things to you) except my selfe; Thus did you sweare, and swore I gaue thee life, Nay did bestow a whole creations worke Vpon thee offal-caitiffe, who ador'd Impression of my foote-steps that was all Exspecting hourely on the happy time When I should dare command what you durst doe, When with aduantage, I would but pronounce O Gracchus giue mee of thy bloud an ounce: Thus did you sweare, you dog-day-villaine, thus; And yet your actions bee malicious: Teach mee, some diuell, to torment the rogue, Else take the righteous rigor of his fault Into the depth of hels extremity; Rescue, ô rescue this offending wretch (Some powers aboue) from my most fatall-wrath, For to afflict thee as the crime deserues Would loose a double part in Paradice: Yet must I punish thee (thou Spiders-gall)— Ser. The toade and spider cannot chuse but brawle. Am. —I must (you creeping cur) and would refuse Rather to be a God, then to forgiue A thing so capitall; and thou escape; But an arch-diuell would I euer bee A fiend of horrour beneath all degree, Eate flames and brimstone to beget mee fierce That with astonish'd fury I might pierce And split each sinew; scare thy plumpest vaine, So racke thy feeling with perpetuall paine. Gra. O feele compassion, for I do repent. Ami. Repent? compassion? I would rather whip My weakned carcasse with a Scorpions taile; Dwell in a nest of Adders, make them sting Till patience could endure; then wash my wounds With burning pitch and lamp-oile, bath in leade, Or make a poultice of some swelling toad, Rather then take one cruell thought from 'load. Gra. Your meanace and commotion do torment Aboue all suffering; ô I will repent Sixe thousand times a day; deuoure my flesh, Feede vpon frogs, or quaffe downe aconite, Kisse and embrace, a fearefull Succubus, If you but leaue to terrifie mee thus. Am. No (theeuish tumbler) leaue thy cheating tricks And sweare allegeance to some puny Lord, Make those beleeue that lacke intelligence, For I am lasht with true experience: Though on thy bosome thou wouldst therefore crawle. And, like a Serpent, liue vpon the dust: Though by continuall creeping thou didst weare Thy breast and belly, (so become submisse In a most new degree) didst licke pathes cleane Where I should walke, and scrape away the filth: Imploy each seruile sinew to my ends, Yet you and I must neuer more be friends. Fall flat vpon thy face (thou paracide) Fall downe as ready (captiue) to abide Our indignation, which in child-birth lies, Big with a thousand swelling lunacies: Expecting all to be deliuered out, And by vexation of thy falling strength, To be an orbe in bredth, an age in length: Fall (thou condemned Shismaticke) and charme The killing rage of my aduanced arme; For I shall proue so desperately mad And full of rigor, in my sharpe reuenge; As to reuoule the terrour of my doome Phansy doth tremble, but my rage makes roome: (False wretch) I must forget humanity, And fall acquainted with some forrest Woolfe; Hee, and such bloudy Tutors shall instruct The shamelesse Art of sauage cruelty, To kill thee, and become exorbitant; I will anatomise thy limbs aliue; Will mince small gobbets of thy quaking flesh And feed my Haukes, while life continues fresh Within the bloudy morsell; make the sluce To quauer when they swallow downe the iuice: The Turke shall teach mee to extend some plague Of most vn-suffering nature: till the day, And thy blaspheming breath doe both decay. But ô quicke sorrow seize mee) what auailes This villaines torture to my liuing woe? For I (except I quickly be trans-form'd Into a Rat, a Hedge-hog, Lowse, or Toade, Some base and obscure animall) must feele Torments more tedious then tongues may expresse, AEquall to which is doubtfull heauinesse: Nay, our attempts and high abuses done Be of such horrid shape, such ample straine; As to absolue them would require a Saint With speciall pardon from almighty Ioue: Yes, though I should obtaine that idle wish Of transmigration; yet the shamefull troupe Of sinnes which weare my scarlet liuery Would follow fast, and (as Acteons dogs) Teare mee to peeces, not remembring, once, That I was maister of the family: If, to become a new conformitant, Imply'd a veniall act; each vertuous thought Should be my fellow: 'tis the fault of all, Wee doe despaire to stand, because we fall. One maxime I retaine by priuiledge; Such secrets, they doe seldome thriue, nor can, Where we depend vpon the breath of man: O had my drudge, my Vassaile bene but true, And faithfull to the fore-cast of my hopes, I had bene braue confederate of Kings, Nay, might haue cal'd some Kings my feodars. (O deuill) hadst thou bene to my desires A sudden knaue and dutifull enough: But for a time hadst thou continued so Vntill some limitation did expire With such obseruance as ranke deuils vse Vpon the pretious morgage of a soule I had bene ready to depart with all; With pleasures, titles, all things, to enrich Thy budding fortunes; all did I reserue Till death determin'd my approaching fate, Onely to thee, then all, was consecrate, By due surrender; but (yong prodigall) Your hopes and life (poore slaue) be pawn'd to mee Whom no sworne-diuels Broker shall exceed In scuruy vsage, though my heart-strings bleed. Gra. If no true mercy then may mittigate Thy dull and stupid deafenesse. I do dare The vt-most of your franticke violence, Cast all thy Adder-stings vpon my heart; Be thy conceited cramps more exquisite Then is a terrible tormenting Bull; Breake forth (Hyæna) get some peeuish dwarfe To hacke mee downe at leasure; till I stand Like a Colossus, like a Cedar tall And yet immoueable with smarting wounds: Stab me now (tyrant) or inflict full paine Vpon each noble ioint and glorious veine, Vertue shall keepe mee with a sacred charme Against the strength of a stipendious arme: The challenge of my cause being heard at large All (to thy damage) would my griefes discharge: Mocke babes and children (sir) with rods in pisse, I did approue no true defence like this, That I haue done vprightly; knit your brow, Swell with a crabbed face conformable, Let your offended garbidge fry in steakes, Truth will auerre, and honest dealing speakes That I haue done vprightly; be asham'd Of thy vniust reuenge, and murther nam'd. Ami. Dare you then buzze (you beetle) and aduance Your voice to contradict superiours? Proud slaue come neerer; hee may liue 'mong rats, Who will be daunted with a swarme of gnats, Much lesse with one poore mushrump; petty sir 'Pray leaue to grumble, (you mad factious curre) Torments shall mittigate and make you tame Paines worse then death, shal make thee deadly lame. Gra. Do I deserue such paines? no fiery youth I haue done most vprightly, will discharge A good officious part, if you proceed, I will vn-maske your shamefull trickes indeed. Am. A squib, a squib, cracke, flash, and spit apace, Breake (my oxe-bladder) vanish into breath, A scritch-owle bids thee sing before thy death, Squeake our rare bag-pipe; flesh-flye buzze againe, Seeme to insult with voyce, (thou very sound) Take thy last leaue, bequeath short life to ground. Gra. Harke how the monstrous whale doth roare alowd. Am. Presaging tempests (Pilot) in the straights. Gra. No huge sea-wonder) I a sword-fish am, Who will by vertue most vpright and plaine, Sting thee, and thresh thee, till thou rore with paine: Proud man, remember what thou well deseru'st, Thinke who hath tempted royall chastity; VVho like a cheating thiefe did steale the Queene, VVith lying vowes, and studied shamelesse oathes, Did play the Iuggler; left the Kings high-way, And went about to breake inclosures: thinke VVho did excell in mischiefe, who did striue To worship Diuels, who did seeke by lust, And meanes new moulded, most in-ordinate, To make a Heauenly Saint a Sodomite, Compell pure thoughts to worship Priapus. Thinke who protended to defile the Queene, And did (aboue pretence) affirme the death Of mad Mænander, the deluded King, And vow Lucilla's death: obserue yong sir The sutable description to the end; And tell vs if it bee significant: Or if the language be too blunt; obserue; Tell your opinion of the congruence, And spew a whetstone vp er'e I proceed: Thinke if I vfe (sir) an affected stile, Thinke also of the strange absurdities, Thinke who's the subiect of my railing theame, And when thou dost consider heauily It is thy wicked selfe whereof I speake And all vprightly spoken; you'le perceiue You want much leasure (friend) to punish mee For mischiefes neerer hand doe threaten thee: Except thou dost despaire and hang thy selfe. Ami. Impudent diuell, didst not heare the voice Of threatning tortures; like so many toads, Night-rauens, or scritch-owles which together sing Thy deaths decree, as a sad funerall dirge? Repent, repent (slaue) and consider well, Who is now sailing to the gates of hell. (Scruants) come apprehend this Eunuch; hoe, Reserue him till the rigor of my doome Demands sharpe execution; tie the wretch With loading manacles, and crucifie This false condemned railer fifty times, Till with excesse of paine the Traitor dies. Gra. I cannot now with-stand hostility, But follow death with such alacrity As one resolu'd vpon religious warre, Such deaths doe purchase a triumphal carre. Scœn. 3. Evphorbvs , Bvfo, Menander, Laelio, Lvcilla, Mantesio, Perillvs. Vnfold your Ensignes, beate your silent Drums, Exchange (I say) their sable cognisance, Adding a limitation to the feares Of this great Captaines death: exhaustad teares May mittigate compunction, not despaire A losse vnmatch'd well worthy of repaire. Weeping should shew our zeale, not once repine At Prouidence aboue, which is Diuine. Bv. But (Agamemnon) now the funerall rites Be finished; new horror, new despights Speake with a bloody accent: Aiax roares, And like a tempest, or the Gyants race, Which lay encamp'd against the God-like face Of great Olimpus, doth hee bellow forth Bumbast exclaimes, and cals vpon desert; Giue me (saith hee) that armour which is due, And (as a trophey of eternall fame) May stout Achilles, that most valiant man, Suruiue in mee: O thou vn-thankfull Greece, (Helmets and launces bee my Orators) Thou art indebted to my braue designes Past restitution; let some Souldier speake, And call thee Bankrout; for I am abus'd: Will you admit a rivall then saith hee In my magnanimous aimes to conquer mee? Will you admit Vlysses? Lae. They approach. Me. Shall eu'ry coward be competitor With Princes of such potent fortitude, Such high descent, such saintish pedigree As Greece can tell I Aiax doe enioy? For Ioue and all the Gods acknowledge mee, My arme hath whole share in the dust of Troy. Per. True (Aiax) true, take double share in dust, But for Achilles now contend we must. Me. Contend with me? (thou creeping snaile) with me? Whom wrathfull Hector on his Elephant, Mounted like Neptune on the curled waues, Loath to incounter, did forsake the field; Through his faire absence did the Troians yeeld. Pe. But (Aiax) wise men know selfe-arrogance Is still instructed sir to amplifie. Me. Fie (prating coxcombe) what a senslesse foole A stupid wretch, and suffring Asse am I To enter-change the aire, and empty voice With such a sheeps-head, a poore Ithacan? Per. (Aiax) Your Giant bragges lacke pollicy, Strength wanting wisedome, argues extasie. Me. Giue vs our launce and helmet, I consume Till I haue turn'd this coward into fume: Fetch some offensiue swords, and scimitars, Iauelings and Curtaxe, I will crush this Ape, And as a trophey weare his captiue skinne; (The doubtfull terror of my certaine spoile Which may affright, and make our foes recoile.) Per. What high renowne or fame is to be had By fighting with a Souldier who is mad? Me. O my forgotten fury swell apace, And spit forth lightning in the cowards face, Who hath no title to his bold pretence, But a most a poore vn-tutor'd eloquence. Ev. Aiax— Bv. Be silent, Agamemnon speakes. Ev. Hang taming fetters on your lofty frownes, Compell thy wrath which is prædominant, Force wilde affections (Aiax.) I professe. Aiax you are too violent; leaue rage, And by appointment of my poore aduice, You (in this great assembly) shall recount Your noble acts; which if they do amount Beyond Vlysses memorable deeds, The armour of Achilles then succeeds To thee alone, made happy through desert, Else to Vlysses shall the armes reuert. Me. Then let me challenge some prerogatiue From this forgotten place: laugh Iupiter, And blame the stupid braines of this rude throng, Which with vnthankfull eies can here behold The ships, the sands, the tattred sailes and shore, (All rescu'd vassailes of my ventrous arme) Yet make vs dead, and vaine Vlysses warme; Warme with the bounty which the frozen snake Will but abuse (my Lords) and you mistake. What man was hee tooke danger by the iawes? Gaue an assault of battry to the ribs Of rampant Horror? hew'd a passage out From spoile and ruine, to reape victory? Wrestled, and rescu'd Nauies from the fire? And did (for safety) senge his beard with flames? Gaue to triumphant Hector the repulse? Quench'd a combustion æquall in extreames To burning Phaëton, and the torrid Zone? What man was hee? No talking verbalist; But I, eeu'n Aiax, with but halfe a fist: Where was my smooth-tongu'd aduersary then? What hope had weake Vlysses to supply A Captaines part with schoole-boyes eloquence? No (poore Vlysses) if thou apprehend'st My vn-resisted victories aright; If you conceiue your disabilities, Your inclinations naturall, and raw, Your lame, and halting courage in exploit; Remembring sir with whom you do contend, With mee, with Aiax, whom no feares offend, Then magnifie your selfe, and thinke it praise, Aboue thy merits, to confesse, by drum, By harpe and sacke-but, that (though ouer-come) Thou didst yet striue with Aiax, and renounce Each other title, which may well denounce Thee indiscreet, and thy assumption proud; Helpe mee (deere Wisedome) to restraine, for I Shall be transported into agony By vertue of a sight so omenous, So full of brazen impudence and feare, As that proud linguist, my competitor. Aduance, aduance, your melancholy brow, Bend your attentiue polititians eare To that which heauen and I will asseuere, You haue been taught to dance, and turne the heele, To runne away betimes, and to forsake Thy friend, nay soule, vpon extremity. Nestor, Tydides, both can well auerre, You lacke the rules of doctrine militant; All rescue is accounted heresie: Which rule (if pitty and compassion both Were not my maximes friend) had cost your life: I saw death's Sergeant ready to arrest Thy pensiue soule, when tumbling downe to earth, I threw my target on thy pallid hearse, Draue backe thy foes, and did thy soule reuerse. Will you (sir) walke vnto the place againe? Goe faigne some foes approach, put feare enough, And wounds on, for a shift, shrinke vp againe, And like the Tortoise vnder-creepe your shell; So sir contend I pray, and stammer well: Be wise (you mighty Captaines) and collect How Hector did the Troian troopes renew, Amazing vaunt-guards with a multitude Of heathen Gods giuing a bloody cause Of quicke despaire to my Antagonist; Nay to the valiant and prouinciall Dukes: This dreadfull man, this Hector (tossing soules Like Gnats and Ants-egges downe to Erebus) I beate him groueling, laid his limbs asleepe; And like a mountaine from the firmament, Downe fell great Hector from his Elephant: Let then a wreath of Oke empale my head, And let Vlysses share with Diomed. Mars be my æquall iudge! what simple man (Except in league with sottish ignorance) Would (vpon forfeit of his patrimony, And stocke of wisedome to debility) Admit Vlysses my competitor To striue in iest with Aiax? if desert Shall in the vp-shot be prædominant, Looke on our out-sides, on our helmets looke; View each mans Beuer, Breast-plate, Sword and Launce, Looke on our out-sides hoe! consider well And pawse vpon each target; giue me leaue, To shew the tokens of a Souldiers claime, And to vncase a cowards infamy. Marke but the difference betwixt our shields: Mine (a true target) hath sustain'd whole groues Of artificiall timber, topt with steele, I stood like Mars among my Troian foes, When all forsooke me but my faithfull targe, It still continued, and did nobly keepe, My limbs expos'd to danger of the field; A Crocodile I thinke may couert sleepe Within the large wounds of my open shield: Cast (I beseech) now halfe a pur-blinde looke Vpon that theeuish varlet; and his shield, Obserue how smooth and faire his night-caps be, His helmets (Lords) I meane, obserue his shield, His Beuer trim'd twise twenty times a day; His gauntlets, gorgets, and his gilded Armes, All of a sweet complexion, sanguine sappe, As to incounter some fine Ladies lappe: Meaning to be a Champion of the smockes, A gallant spruce young warriour indeed, Warre shall presse wiues; for Souldiers do not bleed. Account my phrase no ambiguity, Vlysses sloth my words will verifie: I laugh most freely to imagine how Effœminate Vlysses will support The massy fabricke of Achiles armes, If my deseruings shall be rob'd and loose That which I honour, and affection wooes. Ev. (Aiax) enough; Vlysses now begin: Per. Desire (alas) being not effectuall To raise from Cinders dead mortality, And make a liuing heire indubitate, Heau'n saith, hee shall remaine ambiguous, Till you (great Iudges) doe decide the strife, And so restore Achilles vnto life: Which, because doubtfull, I doe challenge grace Of you my patrons, and this publicke place. The bragging fellow Aiax doth deriue A long forgotten age from Telamon, Striuing to fetch a foolish argument Of his renowned acts, from high discent, If which dead picture of Kings pedigree, Could but infuce a fortune competent, And make that piercing wisedome of the soule A thing intitled to inheritance, I could produce a genealogy, From sacred Ioue, and subtill Mercury; But, may the best of all my stratagems, Which to thy sole aduantage (happy Greece) I haue inuented; may they perish all When I assume the vertue of my sire, As agent for my hope, and chiefe desire. Who tempted braue Achilles to the siege When hee (detain'd with feare of destiny) Was eeu'n excluded in a female robe? When hee forgot to be pontificall, And was a true virago? did refuse Both weapons, and each little sound of warre? I had a feeling of my countries cause, And drew Achilles to the Troian warres; That mighty Captaine of the Mermedons I drew to battell, made him disobey His mother-goddesse, to aduance the state Of weary toile, and trouble Pergamus: I put his armour on; gaue weapons too; For what I gaue (great Lords) I humbly wooe. Speake, did not I incounter Telephon? Turne Thebes to ashes? conquer Tenedos? Chryses and Cylla, Syron, Hector, Troy, All do acknowledge me; my valiant arme, My notable aduice; all attribute The shamelesse ruine of subuerted Troy To me; as author sole, and absolute Of such a safety to the common-weale; Which, notwithstanding (fathers) I renounce, And must acknowledge you the principals Of an atchieuement so perspicuous: And whatsouer the vaine peoples voice, Captaines report, and painfull Souldiers loue, Doth by mis-guided error giue to mee, I render backe with all humility. To vrge my owne directions, and aduice In Architecture of that happy horse, That fatall fabricke (being so fresh in thought) Were to condemne you (mindfull country-men) Of that which wisedome loathes, Ingratitude. To reckon vp Minerua's image, bought With hazard of my breath, and precious limbs, When wedging barres flew from the Iron gates, And gaue accesse vnto that sacred spell, Might argue a most false obliuion In your quicke wisedomes with strange impudence In my most bold surmise. But (Mighties all) May stupid Aiax his reproachfull termes, (Without each scruple to your iudging eares) Be twice retorted in his rotten teeth; So hee may swallow downe such base Rebukes, And make amends to me: for let him know, My suffring shoulders could sustaine the load Not of Achilles armour, but his lumpe Of solid, brawny flesh, both legges and armes, Nay the whole massy trunke truss'd vp in steele: I (Aiax) I, that carkasse once be-stridde, Vpon my shoulders tooke his heauy trunke When death stood there, and in the midst of all Carried Achilles to his funerall. When after thousand sharpe calamities Of warre, of winter, famine, pestilence, Of parching dog-daies, long and tædious, Of tempest, thunder, much mortality, After all these, and ten yeares doubtfull siege, When you forsooke the Campe, did so recoile, As almost scorning a recouery; I charm'd the top-mast, hal'd you backe to shore, Conuerted all to conquest, which before Did seeme aboue my dull inuentiue braine, Giue me a meed for ten yeares toile and paine. Om. Succeed Vlysses, take thy rich desire. Me. Death to my fortunes! shall Vlysses rob My long deseruings of so rich a claime? I will increase the bargaine, stay a while Take my memento. Om. Sir, auoid his rage. Me. Do'st flye from vengeance? whither can you flye? Whither (thou shifting coward) to escape The indignation of my doubtlesse wrath? See how the lurking caitife there doth hide His Cuckow-bill; what fury could abstaine? Lvc. Man. Angels protect vs; helpe, we both are slaine? Lae. Pe. Defend it (fiction.) Me. Helpe it forward (faith) And giue some fee to Iustice: (gallants) know, Mischiefe to high extreames this paire did wooe. Am. With false Pheudippe did conspire wee two. Me. Harke they confesse what wonder did reueale, Giue your applause, and make a merry peale: Call mee not Aiax now, but Mercury, Who could vn-tye a Tragicke riddle thus; Worthy to be esteem'd miraculous. Scœn. 4. Favorina , Gladiator Cannot you (sir) espye the honest man (That noble Eunuch, my deliuerer) Good Gracchus comming yet? Gla. (Deere Madame) no. Fav. Indeed my phansie doth suggest new feare, Seeming to tell me Gracchus is detain'd By his Lords rage, who did (I doubt) returne Sooner then hee exspected; which despight If I could well coniecture to bee true, With wings of lightning I'de againe goe backe And bring my Eunuch from captiuity. Gla. Take then some officers to apprehend The lustfull traitor. Fa. Such delay is long, And my deere Eunuch may be dead alas With tortures and extremity of paine, Er'e such late rescue doth aduantage giue, To qualifie his torment; hee, good man, (Little affected with ensuing harme) Bestow'd vpon mee a deliuerance, Which is repaid (I feare) with bloody stripes: Stay not my purpose; but giue charity A gentle freedome to deliuer one Who is my comfort; (friend) I will returne: And (let no liuing soule participate Of what I say, except my selfe and aire) [aside] I will, through colour of a pious end, Enioy Amilcar, whom I did refuse: For, to set free my Eunuch, will affoord A fine prætext, though I do prostitute; Which I did eeu'n desire, exspecting still Vpon each little signe of violence, (The modest shadow of a secret whore) So will I winne what was halfe lost before. Gla. Madam, you do protract the pretious time, Fa. Leaue me, I will returne. Gla. The way's not farre; Walke on whilst I assemble Officers. Fa. A needlesse caution, be content I pray To take no care, saue what I shall command; Be not so dutifull aboue thy hire, Bring mee no water when I call for fire. Gla. A riddle: so in safeties name walke on: Yet seeing the woman will be obstinate, I (to auoid suspition) will goe home, Fetch neighbours, and incompasse round the walles, If Lords like out-lawes liue, the kingdome falles. Scœn. 5. Hyarchvs , Hipponax, Laelio. When, when (ô Goddesse) will thy anger leaue To punish nature, and afflict poore man, Who was created to offensiue sinne? The Souldiers awe, and common peoples rage, Make ciuill customes be licentious; Rapine, rude contracts, discord, enmity, All take their essence from one extasie: Hip. Mænander liues, the lucklesse cause of all; His life alone procures the kingdomes fall: Lae. The longer life, the losse more eminent: Know (Lords) I am a witnesse ocular, And may with priuiledge informe you both Of a most new and fatall accident: The King, Mænander, did produce a Scœne, A Scœne of Aiax, that vnhappy play (Pretending sport) became a Tragedy For blood, and breath's efluxion: fiue deepe wounds (wearing Mænanders badge) at once depriu'd The sister Royall, next ally'd, by law Of birth, and natiue consanguinity, From hope of all succession to the chaire. Amb. Lucilla dead? Lae. VVith her Mantesio sleeps: Each life was tributary to the rage Of our mad King; but each accus'd it selfe As priuy, to that arch-conspiracy So long forgotten; to Pheudippe's crime. Hy. Conceal'd so long? Hip. Who did discouer it? Lae. A question doubtfull, but Mænander saith An apparition did reueale the truth. Hip. Shadows may walke indeed. Hy. Impossible! I am resolu'd against all argument; I am incredulous; dead neuer walke. Lae. Neuer the same, yet the similitude. Hy. Who sayes againe so, weel'e averre the lye; What be no things of nature, I account Fables. Hip. You are not Metaphysicall. Hy. No sir: I thinke the age is giddy; death! Can wee from ashes raise a second life? The age is drunken sure. Lae. A doting age. Hy. The times are dizzy. Lae. No man doth deny A theame so irrepugnable and true: Reasons owne selfe will be our advocate In prouing what you speake; for punics know The world's lame reuoluti'on hath beene long, And all partake of mundane giddinesse: The turning round of earth hath touch'd our braine; The longer age, the more absurd and vaine. Hip. Age must decline, life's comfort will decay, Though all things perish, let religion stay. Scœn. 6. Amilcar , Favorina, Gracchvs, Gladiator, Servi: Stipatores. I haue a thousand plagues in readinesse, Strappadoes, and empalements, pitch, and oile, A Racke of Bow-strings, a tormenting Bull.

Fav. O saue my Eunuch, and I will submit My whole reuenue, life, and chastity To your disposall. Ami. President of shame! Shoote (hell) a bon-fire of vnbounded flame, And may each heau'nly star augment his light To make this woman famous, may each night Change foggy darkenesse to prodigious day, And (by some signe) a subtle whoore display To be the miracle of monstruous age Worthy of iudgements quill, and natures stage. Are you the vestall? that religious Nun, Who speake no sillable but Innocence, Sacred deuotion, Virgin chastity? Raile at our fleshly sinnes, concupisence, Temptations actuall, and yet embrace, Nay, hug hels bosome? creepe into the vice (Which you would seeme so liuely to abhorre) Gaping at small occasion? (Madam) know Affection is my seruant, Will my slaue, Passion my drudge, Temptation is my page And I more easily can command them all, Then may a Turke his tugging Gally-slaue: Know, I contemne that curteous venery Which is affoorded scot-free; such nice dames Would seeme to couer when they couet flames. Of puddle-water no sicke patient drinkes; A pretious odour, cheapely valued, stinkes. And, that you may conceiue how I esteeme Your beauty; thus will I deforme— Fa. O helpe. Gla.

Tilt in my face (Euphorbus) and reclaime The slight opinion of our Deity. Tilt in our face (I say) and thence collect If I be Hermes; make some steady thrust, And call mee Sacred, Matchlesse, Mercury: Beleeue it (youth) I will dis-ioine thy necke And shoulders, if thon dost againe deny That I am Hermes, Ioues Embassadour, A winged, and im-penetrable God: Tilt therefore in my face, tilt speedily; Be thou con-iur'd by lawes of sanctity. Evp. The fiend (sir) doth oppresse my feeble arme. Men. (Caitife) prouoke not my offensiue rage Least I depriue thee of all future age. Evp. Then I must kill thee (King.) Me. I am a God; Translated by the voice of Parliament Which sits aboue this cloudy firmament: I am a God Euphorbus; am no King; The Tawny-more, and Ethiop shall bring Vnto my Altars pleasant sacrifice, Fresh Opo-balsum; Fawnes of paradice; Roe-buckes and balme to please our Deity. Stab vs (thou Athiest) stab vs, and beleeue That I am perfect shadow, am a God; Thrust thy vn-willing Poniard through my ribs; And thence perceiue our full Deuinity; Auoide my wrath (I say) 'tis dangerous, If you refuse, I am vnmercifull. Ev. Stand to thy fortune (God) my dagger comes: Me. Deep enough dig then: ô my smal wound smarts My breath is stopt, my God-like soule departs. Evp. So: I now assume the intellectuall robe Of Reason; and re-linquish Lunacy Which idle feare brought mee acquainted with: And (as I hope) the vnderstanding heads, Which rule this Common-wealths society; Will construe this an act of Piety. Lae. Where is the King? I carry newes of ioy— Bv. Where is the King? dead Fauorina liues. Ev. Heere lies the King who did enforce a death Vpon the perill of his Authors life, If hee refus'd to execute his will. Ambo. Euphorbus then recouer'd? Ev. Yes; for I Did counterfeit a couz'ning lunacy.

Flea him, and make a trophey of his skin. Fav. Cut off his members; bind and broile the slaue. Hip. Let him be quarterd. Ami. To deceiue all these Were pollicy aboue the rules of Art: I haue concluded to preuent the shapes Of torture; death by death alone escapes. Om. Saue, saue the Traitor, saue him. Gla. Hee is dead. Hip. May then the Traitor sleepe in tortures bed. Evp. But may Mænanders dying soule ascend; Whom for the safety of this Common-wealth, I did restore to happinesse and health. Hip. Hy. Amazement of our age! wonder of time! Evp. Touch'd with a feeling of my Countries good I dipt my dagger in his royall blood, By his owne chiefe desire; so leaue mad care, Which my suspicion did assume through feare. Om.

Horror, affrightments, death, and anger flye, Flye to the bottome of hels darke Abysse, That heau'n may smile vpon the clouded earth And all take notice wee are pacifi'd: Grim death triumphant, whose empaled brow Can terrefy the factious Kings below, (Who when wee were incens'd through blasphemy Sent forth reuenge to please our Deity) Shall now enchaine that mischiefe mercilesse, And qualify reuengefull greedinesse: Discloud thy lustre (my new borrowed shine) Scatter thy foggy damps which doe debarre My bounteous lamp of vniuersall light: Let exhalations giue my honour place, All stars attendant looke earth in the face. Gods cannot dwell in rage; though slimy man If but en-nobled by permissiue law, Dares prosecute his vengeance to the death Till hee extirpe a whole posterity: Wee though immortall, though aboue best braines To comprehend; though sole efficients, Though euery thing in essence, though deuine, Though Gods; (in which one syllable, the summe Of euery thing's inuolu'd) though Gods wee are, Yet in compassion wee doe still accept Those that prophane our sacred holinesse. For; should the anger of Omnipotence Punish man-kind so often, or so long As their insatiate folly doth deserue, Ioue would be weary and the Gods aboue Turne boyling wrath into aboundant loue.
