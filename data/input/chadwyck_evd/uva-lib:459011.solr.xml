      <field name="fulltext">Hic totus volo rideat Libellus. Mart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A PrÃ¦ludium to Mr. RICHARD BROMES Playes. Then we shall still have Playes! and though we may Not them in their full Glories yet display; Yet we may please our selves by reading them, Till a more Noble Act this Act condemne. Happy will that day be, which will advance This Land from durt of precise Ignorance; Distinguish Morall Virtue, and Rich Wit, And gracefull Action, from an unfit Parenthesis of Coughs, and Hums, and Haes, Threshing of Cushions, and Taupologies. Then the dull Zelots shall give way, and flye, Or be converted by bright Poesie. Apollo may enlighten them, or else In Scottish Grots they may conceale themselves. Then shall Learn'd Johnson reassume his Seat, Revive the PhÅnix by a second heat. Create the Globle anew, and people it, By those that flock to surfet on his Wit. Judicious Beaumont, and th' Ingenious Soule Of Fletcher too may move without controule. Shakespeare (most rich in Humours) entertaine The crowded Theaters with his happy veine. Davenant and Massinger, and Sherley, then Shall be cry'd up againe, for Famous men. And the Dramatick Muse no longer prove The peoples Malice, but the peoples Love. Black, and white Fryers too, shall flourish againe, Though here have bin none since Queen Mary's reign. Our Theaters of lower note in those More happy daies, shall scorne the rustick Prose Of a Jack-pudding, and will please the Rout, With wit enough to beare their Credit out The Fortune will be lucky, see no more Her Benches bare, as they have stood before. The Bull take Courage from Applauses given, To Eccho to the Taurus in the Heaven. Lastly, St. James may no aversion show, That Socks, and Buskins tread his Stage below. May this Time quickly come, those daies of Blisse Drive Ignorance down to the dark Abisse. Then (with a justly attributed praise) Wee'l change our faded Broom, to deathlesse Baies. Aston Cokaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Stationer, on the publishing Mr . Bromes Comedies. Since Poems of this nature, honest Freind, Do, of themselves, nor praise nor discomend An Author or his Work; but He, and It, Must by the Readers Palate rise or set; What need we write Encomiums, or expose Our judging Rhymes, to be laught at in Prose? We're like Godfathers (as they're us'd of late) Not to Engage for Children, but give Plate. And truely scarce there is a Poet known, That praises others wit, but clawes his own. But tis the Custome, and who won't submit, Must be esteem'd a Schismatick in wit: And therefore in obedience to the power, Ile tell the World, I've read these Poems o're, And in them finde so naturall a vaine Of clean, rich Fancie, in so pure a straine: That I may safely say, who does not love it, Can't for his life write any thing above it. This witty Pen, this mirthfull Comick style, Makes us at once both serious, and smile. Wraps serious truths in fab'lous mysteries, And thereby makes us merry, and yet wise. No Gods, or Goddesses his rimes supply'd, One he ador'd, and all the rest defy'd. No stradling Tetrasyllables are brought To fill up room, and little spell, or nought. No Bumbast Raptures, and no lines immense, That's call'd (by th' curtesie of England) sence. But all's so plaine, that one may see, he made it T' inform the understanding, not invade it. And the designes so probable, that though They be not true, tis like they may be so. Thus Travellour-like, I do inform our Nation, Being return'd, what is my Observation. But if, as Coriat did, I do relate Buildings, and Gallowses, not Acts of State; Pardon my want of skill, and Ile be Debtor To him, that on perusall notes things better. Alex. Brome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Ingenious Comedies of Mr . Richard Brome. See the strange twirle of Times! when such poore things Out-live the Dates of Parliaments, or Kings! This Revolution makes exploded Wit Now see the fall of those that ruin'd it. And the Condemned Stage hath now obtain'd To see her Executioners Arraign'd. There's nothing permanent; those high great men, That rose from Dust, to Dust may fall agen. And Fate so orders things, that the same houre Sees the same man both in Contempt, and Power. For th' Multitude, in whom the power doth lye, Do in one breath cry Haile, and Crucify. Time was, when Learning, Poesie, and Wit, Were counted Sacred things, and hard to get. Time was, when Playes were justly valu'd, when Poets could laugh away the Crimes of men. And by Instructive Recreations teach More in one houre, then some in ten do preach. But Times are chang'd; and tis worth our note, Bishops, and Players both suffer'd in one Vote. And reason good, for they had cause to feare 'em, One did suppresse their Schismes, and tother jeere 'em. Bishops were guiltiest, for they swell'd with Riches, Tother had nought, but Verses, Songs, &amp; Speeches. And by their ruine, the State did no more, But robb the Spittle, and unrag the poore. And the Stern Poet, challenging as due His ancient right, with freedome to speake true; Div'd into secrets, and 'cause hee'd not be brib'd To silence, nor complyance, was proscrib'd. While those in Cloakes, and double Caps, so long, So long did thrash in their inspired throng; Till at the last, instead of Curbing Sin, By corrupt lives, and jars, they brought it in. But now new Stars shine forth, and do pretend, Wit shall be cherisht, and Poets finde a Friend. This makes these sleeping Poems now creep forth, As innocent of wrong, as full of worth. Where Vice, and Vanity, are laught to scorn, And unstain'd Vertue to the Skies is born. May this Work prove successefull, and we finde Those men, that now are Pow'rfull, to be kinde! And give encouragement to Wit, and Worth, That things of Weight may come with boldnesse forth! For, to the being of a happy State, Pleasure, and Profit must Incorporate. And if we in our Bellies place our sence, 'Twixt Beasts, and us, pray what's the difference? Poets are the Custodes of our Fame, Were't not for Homer, where's Achilles Name? Let Souldiers then protect, while Poets praise; Since that, which Crownes the Browes of Both, is Baies. ALEX. BROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. Reader, the Sale-man sweares, youle take it very ill, if I say not somewhat to you too, Introth you are a stranger to me; why should I Write to you? you neuer writ to mee, nor I thinke will not answere my Epistle. I send a Comedie to you heer, as good as I could then make; nor sleight my presentation, because it is a play: For I tell thee Reader, if thou bee'st ignoraunt, a Play is not so ydle a thing as thou art, but a Mirrour of mens liues and actions now, be it perfect or imperfect, true or false, is the Vice or Vertue of the Maker. This is yet, as well, as I can, Qualeis ego vel Cluuienus, Thou must needs haue some other Language then thy Mother tong, for thou thinkst it impossible for me to write a Play that did not vse a word of Latine, though he had enough in him. I haue beene vexed with vile playes my selfe, a great while, hearing many, nowe I thought to be euen with some, and they shoulde heare mine too. Fare thee well, if thou hast any thing to say to me, thou know'st where to heare of me for a yeare or two, and no more I assure thee. N. F.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Loued Sonne, Nat. Field, and his Wether-cocke Woman. To many formes, as well as many waies, Thy Actiue Muse, turnes like thy Acted woman: In which, disprais'd inconstancie, turnes praise; Th' Addition being, and grace of Homers Sea-man, In this life's rough Seas tost, yet still the same: So turns thy wit, Inconstancy to stay, And stay t' Inconstancy: And as swift Fame Growes as she goes, in Fame so thriue thy Play, And thus to standing, turne thy womans fall, Wit turn'd to euerie thing, prooues stay in all.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Should I not speake a Prologue, and appeare In a starch'd formall Beard and Cloake, I feare, Some of this Auditory would be vext, And jay this is a Sermon without a Text. Some thinke it so essentiall, that they say Nor foole, nor Prologue, there can be no Play. Our Author's unprovided, and doth vow, What e're I say must stand for Prologue now; Then have at wit for once, why mayn't I be Inspir'd with wit, and sence extempore? But first I'le tell you, that I had commission From him to tell you that hee'l not petition To be dubb'd Poet, for he holds it fit, That nought should make a man a wit, but wit, Hee'll 'bide his triall, and submits his cause To you the Jury, so you'l judge by Lawes. If Pride or Ignorance should rule, he feares An unfaire tryall, 'cause not try'd by's Peeres. Faith be your selves a while, and pass your vote On what you understand, and doe not dote On things 'bove nature or intelligence; All we pretend to is but Mirth and Sence. And he that lookes for more, must ee'ne goe seeke Those Poet-Bownces that write English Greeke. Our Author aimes only to gaine you laughter, Which if you won't, hee'l laugh at you hereafter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Piso, Fabritio. Pi. Come, I protest i'le have you home againe, And tell all to your Father, if you goe not More chearfully on about this businesse. Fab. O Piso! dearest (dearest?) only Friend, That Name of Father tis, that checks my blood, And strikes a filiall Reverence through my Soule; Layes load upon my loynes, clogging my steps, And like an armed Angell warnes me back. Pi. So, so, he runs away to proper purpose That beares his Hue and Cry in's conscience. Fab. It is not yet day-light: night will conceale My secret purposes. I will returne. Pi. Do so; and damne thee blacker then the night, Thee and thy Father too for company Expresse your filiall Reverence so, doe so. Fab. Deare Piso peace. Pi. Peace fond Fabritio. Dost thou not fly from him to save his Soule? His and thine own to boot? will not thy stay (Stay not to answer me!) ruine your Family; Cut off all hope of Blessing, if not Being Of your Posterity? and all this by obaying A wilfull Father in a lawlesse Marriage; More fatall (I foresee't) then ere our State Of Venice yet produc'd example for. Fab. O now thou tear'st my very bowells Piso, Should I consent (as I dare not deny My over-hasty Father) to this match, I should submit my selfe the most perfidious, That ever shadow'd Treachery with Love. No, my Victoria, sooner shall this steele Remove thy hindrance from a second choyce, Then I give word or thought, but to be thine. Pi. Why flie we not to Rome then, where you left her, And shun the danger of your Fathers Plot, Which would not only force you break your Faith With chast Victoria, but to wed another, Whose faith is given already to another? Double damnation! 'Twere a way indeed To make your childen bastards o' both sides. Fab. Can there no way be found to shun the danger Of this so hastily intended Marriage, But by my flight, and the most certaine losse Of mine inheritance? Pi. That would be thought on. Fab. Stay; who comes here? Musick, and divers Gentlemen passe to and fro with lights, at last Enter Pantaloni, lighted by Nicolo, with darke Lanthorns. Pi. Some Night-walkers, that throw Balls at their Mistresses, well of all Citties Under the universall raigne of venery, This is the civill'st! in what sweet tranquillity, The subjects passe by and salute each other! Stay what grave beast, what reverend Gib is that? (I'th' name of darknesse) dropt out of a gutter? O age what art thou come to! Fab. Pray forbeare. Pi. Looke there Fabritio, Venus can it be? Feb. Come y'are deceav'd. Pi. Nay now I know I am not, For by that little loving glimpse of light That leads him on, Fabritio, tis thy Father. Fab. I pray thee peace. Pi. What will this City come to? A young man shall not shortly venture to A vaulting Schoole for feare he jumpe in the Same sadle with his Father, to the danger Of his old bones. Enter Francisco, and Horatio. Stay here comes more. This is Some speciall haunt! sure tis the habitation Of the Novella lately come to Town, Which drawes the admiration of all The Rampant Gallantry about the City! Fab. They say shee's yet a Virgine. Pi. And is like So to continue, still shee prove stale fish, At the rate shee's stamp'd for: for she has set Such a large price upon her new nothing, That Venery and Prodigality are at ods About her, it seemes thy Father could not bargaine. Fab. Fie! 'twas not he. Pi. Not hee! peace and stand close. Fran. Is shee so rare a Creature, this Novella? Ho. Rare? above excellent (man) it is unpossible For a Painter to flatter her, or a Poet to bely her In ayming to augment her beauty: For I saw her that can judge. Pi. Now if a man Were to unkennell the handsomest shee Fox In Venice, let him follow these doggs. Sure Shee is earth'd hereabouts. They have the sent. Fran. You have not seene her often? Hor. Onely thrice At Church, That's once for every day, that shee Has beautified this City. Pi. What rare helpe May this be to devotion, that he speaks of! Fran. And all this Beauty, and this seeming vertue Offer'd to sale? Pi. I thought 'twas such a peece. Hor. Thence only springs the knowledge of her worth Marke but the price shee's cry'd at: two thousand Duccats For her Maydenhead, and one moneths society. Pi. What a way, now, would that money reach In Buttock-beefe. Hor. Shee is indeed for beauty, Person, and Price, fit onely for a Prince: I cannot thinke a lesse man then the Duke Himselfe must beare her; and indeed 'twere pitty That shee should sinne at lesse advantage. Fran. Why do we then make way to visit her By our expence in Musick? Pi. A wary whore-master: I like him well: A penneyworth for a penny would be look'd for. Hor. Why Francisco? Why? Pi. Francisco! is it hee? Hor. Although her price be such to be sold for In ready money, shee is yet allow'd To give herselfe for love if shee be pleas'd. Who knowes how well shee may affect a man (As here and there a Woman may by chance) Onely for vertue? That's worth our adventure, But I wish rather we could purchace her At the set price betwixt us for a twelvemonth Our friendship should not suffer us to grudge At one anothers good turnes. Pi. There's love in couples, What whelpes are these? sure this Francisco is The late forsaken lover, betroth'd to Flavia Whom now thy Father would so violently Force thee to marry. Fab. Would he had her Piso. Pi. O here they pitch, stand close, wee'l heare their Musick. Song. Hor. Come sad Francisco, wee'l to morrow see This Miracle of nature, whose meere sight Will wipe away the injury thou sufferd'st In Flavia; and make thee quite forget her. Pi. Tis he, and I will speake to him. Hor. Good forbeare. Pi. Francisco must not so forget his Flavia. Hor. What are you? Pi. Men, that would have you be so, And not to wanton out your holy vowes Drawes Dancing your selfes to th'Devill. Fran. VVhat doe you meane? Pi. I meane, Francisco, you too much forget The love you bore to Flavia, shee to you, Hor. Shee has forsaken him, and is bestow'd (Forc'd by the torrent of her fathers will) On young Fabritio, Pantalonies Sonne. Pi. Here stands the man denies it, speake Fabritio. Fab. Not that I undervalue Flavius worth, But not to violate her faith by breach Of mine, were all this signiory her dowry (Here is my hand Francisco,) i'le not wed her. Fran. I must embrace you sir. Hor. And Gentlemen, My Lodging is not farre, please you retire, And there repose your selfes untill the light That now is near at hand, shall point you forth A way to future comfort; you shall finde Good wine and welcome, please you to accept it Pi. Your offer sir is large: yet let me aske If we may rest securely for a day; Lurke close and private, till the appointed houre For this forc'd Marriage be over-slipp'd, In case that our necessity may require it? Hor. I understand you, Take mine honor of it. Pi. Be cheard Fabritio, thou shalt not to Rome, VVe may prevent thy danger nearer home. Now night we thanke, and follow thee away (As being thy servants) from th' approach day. Hor. You conclude well, lovers and sprights are Night-walkers, warn'd away by th'morning, Starre. Ex. SCENE II. Enter Guadagni in his Study. A Taper, Baggs, Books, &amp;c. Gua. Whilest yet the Leaden finger'd god of sleepe Keeps close the eye-lids of phantastick youth, Feeding their aery fancies with light dreames, Of wanton pleasures; giddy, vaine delights, The ever watchfull cares of aged Parents Throw ope the gates and windowes of soft rest, Making our midnight noone, to guard and order The wholsome fruits of our continuall labour. VVholsome and happy off-springs of my paines Thus I salute you and implore your safty, And thus that you may rest, grow and increase Mine eyes prevent the breakers of your peace. But see the morning hastens to relieve me! Day spreads apace, and warmes the provident hand Doe out the uselesse taper. Hoe! what hoe! Enter Nanula, Astutta. Nanulo! Astutta! is it midnight with you? Nan. Your servants are all here and ready sir. Gua. About about, you drowsy headed drones, VVhere is my Daugher? Ast. Up and ready too sir. Gua. Sirrah haste you to Pantalonies house. Nan. The rich Magnifico? Gua. VVho else, you Rat? Tell him I doe attend his comming hither, To expedite the worke we have in hand. Nan. It shall be done sir, please you give me passage. Gua. Here take the Keys; lock the dore after him Then call my Daughter to me. Ast. See shee's here sir. Ex. Nan. Ast. Gua. Flavia my Girle, see how my early care Provides for thee, The toyle of many yeares By dayly travaile, and my nightly watches Lies here in readinesse to build thy fortune. And take it willingly, since thou consentst To match unto my will; whereby this Coyne, Thy selfe, and both our joyes may finde increase. I can no lesse then thanke thee Flavia, Although I must confesse, my sute was long, And grievous to me, ere thy childish will Yeilded to my appointment of a husband: For whom (with no small joy I speak't) thou didst Cast off (indeed) the off-scum of his blood The poore, degenerate in fortune, fellow, I scorne to name him. Fla. Alas my Franciscoâ Gua. By which thou gain'st the Nonpareil of heires In all this wealthy City. Fla. Sir tis not The Riddance of the one, to gaine the other, Both which are equall blessings unto me Can ad unto my present happinesse More, then the thought of your paternall wisdome, VVhose provident care was author of this good: Chiefly to you I therefore wish the comfort. Gua. It will be so: I finde it my deare child For though thy joy I know will be abundant Mine must exceed, that includes thine with it. VVhy smil'st thou Flavia? to think how deare Thy Hymeneall day, to morow is? Fla. No I could weepe for that. Gua. How! ha! whats that? This money's mine againe, and thou art not If thou dost wish one dayes procrastination, Degenerate brat, changelingâ Fla. Deare FatherâFatherâ Gua. Th'ast seene thy last of happinesse: all content From this black minute, and thy selfe are strangers. Fla. Sir, I beseech you heare meâ Gu. Get you in I'le mew you up where never Sun shall show Into what endlesse misery i'le cast thee; Nor any sound bring succour to thine Eare. To call thee back from torment. Fla. Sir,âdeare sirâ Gua. My selfe will be your Keeper, Cook, and Carver. Fla. Indeed you will be sorry. Gua. Sorry! for what? Fla. For the mistake you run away withall. Gua. Didst thou not say thou wept'st, because to morrow was come so nigh? Fla. So nigh and yet not come sir, Fearing how many dangerous houres are thither. Gua. Ha! I beginne to be now sorry indeed. Fla. Loves Minutes sir, are dayes, and houres are years, When each protracted, multiplies our feares. Gua. Now I am sorry with all my heart; and here's a Thousand checqines to expiate my trespasse. But do not let thy husband know of them Till he redeeme a fault to their full value, Oh mine own Girle, my honey, honey Girle: Fla. Was not I sir applauding of your wisdome, And giving you the glory of my comfort In this approved match? Gua. Thou didst, thou didst, With teares of joy I must confesse thou didst. Fla. Had you but heard me out, I had magnified My fortune, sprung out of your providence. Gua. Speake yet, and I will heare attentively. Fla. First then, how first your admirable wisdome Weighing how I had setled my affection Upon Francisco excellent in parts, Of noble blood, how ever low in fortune, You gave your free consent (knowing your estate To be a portion fitter to restore him Unto the dignity of his Ancestors, Then to be added to anothers Muck-hill) That I should be his wifeâ Gua. What's this you say? Fla. Nay deare sir flie not off. Gua. Well, on then, on. Fla. I say you gave consent, that I should be Wife to that noble Gentleman (pray sit still sir) As you had foreseene my future happines Only in him consistedâsir untill This wealthy heire, young Fabritio, You Neighbour Trades-mans Son, of great estate, Was by his father tender'd unto you For me a husband, then unseene by mee: But since I must confesse a proper man, Worthy a fitter Wifeâ Gua. Sweet Modesty. Fla. But that your wisdome needs will have it so, By reason that his heapes may purchase honour, Which to'thers wants can never wash away, But farewell him: I must looke this way now; And crown your wisdome with this closing point, That whereas I betroth'd was to Francisco, And Pantalonies Sonne unto another, (A Lady as tis justified at Rome) You force me on this man, the fittest husband On whom to make my party good hereafter, Who shall not dare to upbraide my breach of faith. Gua. And ist not a sound policy my Flavia? A Bell rings. But now no more; old Pantaloni comes, I take it. How now! dos he not come? Enter Nanulo. Nan. Signor Pantaloni, sir, intreats you Meet him on the Rialto instantly, That you may goe to the Advocates together. Gua. It is my Flavia interchangeably To seale your Marriage covenants; make thee happy, Looke to my house and havings; keepe all safe, I shall be absent most part of this day. Be carefull Girle, thine own speciall good Requires thee to't: and therefore I dare trust thee. Fla. Happy successe attend you sir, whilst I Rest here in prayers for you. Gua. Thanks my child, Come sirrah lock the doore. But first (dee hear) Beware that none have entrance in my absence Except Fabritio, Pantalonie's Sonne; Or such as I have warranted, looke to it. Nan. With due respect. Gua. Come lock the doore I say. Exit. Fla. I, I, be sure of that, and I could wish My thoughts were prisoners too: that they might fly No further then the casement, or the wicket; Where they (loose things) get out, and nothing bring Back to this heart, but cold and sad returnes: O my Astuttaâ Enter Astutta. Ast. Now or never helpe me! Fla. As thou didst ever dreame what true love was, Fancy some way to quit me of this bondage; Or else contrive this houre to be my last. Ast. What! would you disobey your Father? what! So good, so carefull, and so wise a Parent? Fla. O doe not vex me into longer life. Either speake helpe, or let me die in silence. Ast. Yes, at sixteene; you would die at sixteene? Fla. Else let thy pitty of my youth preserve me. Ast. O Cupid what a Termagant tyrant art thou Over poore subjects of sixteene! There is not one Among a hundred of those ticklish Trifles But is more taken with a Toy at sixteene Then six and twenty: because by that time The edges of most maydenheads are allayd. Fla. Nay deare Astutta hast thou thought a course? Ast. What to prevent your Father, my good Master? Thinke you I can turne traytor to his trust, And crosse his purpose for your Marriage? Fla. If Knife, or Poyson, Fire, or Water may Remove this wretched cause, i'le do it else. Ast. Yes, you were best leape from the top o'th'house Into the Cavail grande: and there perhaps Some courteous Gondaliar may catch you up, And waft you to some house of deare delight. Fla. Thou tortur'st me. Ast. You see the doore is shut, And Go-by-ground your fathers Giant here More sterne then Cerberus holds fast the Key, You can make no excursion; nor let in Any attempt for your redemption: No Letter or a Message can approach you, But by this Gyant-dwarfe your Fathers Agent, Though I my selfe were wicked to assist you. Fla. O couldst thou be so vertuous! Then I know Some quaint devise would issue from thy braine To conjure and controwle his weaker spirits. Thou knowst I have command of Gold and Jewells Enough to buy a Senators large conscience: Doe thou command it all to win him to us, That petty thing. Dos he appeare bribe-free? Is he the only officer uncorrupted? Enter Nanulo. Nan. Madona Flavia newes. Fla. What I beseech you? Nan. From your elected Bridegroome, brave Fabritio. Ast. Dissemble patience as you are a woman, Or hope to be; and heare him handsomely. Fla. How dos hee Nanulo? Ast. That was well said. Nan. VVell and respectfull towards you it seemes, For hee desires you not to stir abroad, As I could wish you would notâ Fla. Insolent slave! You know I may not stir beyond the Key You keepe, and yet you wish me stay within. Ast. VVill you marre all? the reason? Nan. The reason is, he meanes to send anon A Mercadante from the Merceria, The famous Pedler woman of this City VVith her most precious wares; for you to choose VVhat you shall like, and take them as his presents, (A ceremony us'd on wedding Eves) Such Rings, such Things, such Knacks, such Knots &amp; Bobs; Such Curles, such Purles, such Tricks and Trilly bubkins As Mayds would turne no Mayds almost to see 'hem! And can you yet be angry at such newes VVith me the gladsome bringer? Ast. Very good! I have heard of this rare Pedler-woman; And that shee is much us'd in close affaires Twixt parties Hee and Shee; and doe not doubt Since you make golden offers (gentle Mistresse) To worke her to your ends, as neare (dee marke?) As womans wit may reach at such a pinch, Pray let her come. Fla. VVell sir, you know I shall not stir abroad; VVhen shee is come shee's welcome with my thanks. Returne so by the messenger. Nan. Most readily. Exit. Ast. Now Mistris if I chance to set the sadle On the right horse; that is, to place your Mayden-head VVhere you would faine bestow it, I trust you will Out of your store reward me with a dowry Fit to convey me to a Tradesmans-Bed. Fla. Yes, and wish there a second Maydenhead, On the condition. Ast. Well, be chearfull then, And cleare those cloudy looks, awake your senses, Refresh your temples, rowse invention up. I have found ground to build on; but there lacks Much rewing, squaring, joynting, to make sure, Against all stormes, our lofty Archi'ture, Come up to councell? Fla. Now thou comforts me. Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Pantoloni, Guadagni, Nicolo, with a Zaffies habit under his arme. Pan. Is this Checquino's house, your Advocate? Gua. It is, and Prospero your learned Councell Is with him here, attending too, our comming. Pan. Tis well, Give me my writings Nicolo, Please you to enter: I'le dispatch my man, Exit. Guad. And follow instantly. Now Nicolo, About the serious busines Nicolo, In which this morning I instructed you. Nic. For your revenge sir. Pan. Right my Apprehension On that discourteous, cursed Curtezan, Twill breed me more delight, then all the dalliances I could have found in her most free ambraces; I hug my quick and sweet invention for it; Here take this gold; this bright refulgent gold, Twenty Checquines, and promise twenty more On the performance of the brave exploy't Twill take unto my wish, I doe foresee't. Nic. Twill be sir, such a notable Revenge That the report of it in after-ages Will either mortifie concupiscence In young lascivious Harlots; or, at least, Fright out of 'em their itch of wronging age: They shall no more dare to put youthfull tricks On yeares, and gravity. Pan. Right my Nicolo. Nic. Sli'd sir, and if you should not be revengd, An old man should not step in the Bordello Without the taunts of Boyes and Gondeliers, Crying take heed, old man, you be not serv'd As the Movella fitted Pantaloni. So, in short time, the City were well serv'd When age shall be asham'd to crawle to lechery. Pan. Right, witty Knave. Go heartily about it, Thinke what a Master tis thou dost it for, That has no slender tie upon thy duty; One that has bred thee from a youngling up To this maturity. Nic. I must acknowledge it. Pan. And Nicolo, it was no petty kindnes To manumize your Father from the Galley Which you cannot forget. Nic. Yet must I heare itâ? Pan. But i'le urge thee no further. Boy be carefull; Worke but this for me with effect and speed, And bind me as a Father to thy need. Exit. Nic. You have even spoyl'd all now. I had as good a mind And thought to ha' gone as heartily about This peece of villany as the Devill, that Is in my Master could devise, or wish Till that ore-doing spirit put me out; Could he not see 'twas well; and mischievous Enough in conscience, but himselfe must crosse it? Dos he thinke by redeeming of my Father To slave me with his boasts, and foule upbraydings? Had he still rowd i'th' gally, I not knowing, The toyle, the smart and griefe had been his own: Now I inherit what was then his paine, Hearing continually the clash of's care, And his fell stripes, out of this Bablers mouth, Which more then kills my thanks; it wreaks my Spleen. To brag of benefits one hath bestowne Doth make the best seeme lesse, and most seem none: So often times the greatest curtesie Is by the doer made an injury. Enter Fabritio. Fab. Nicolo well met. I saw you house my Father, And waited for you. Come you shall draw neare. This is a neare friends Lodging Gentlemen, Piso, Francisco, Hora. at a Table, Wine, &amp;c. My fathers speciall man I told you of; Pray bid him welcome. Hor. Most intirely, Please you to sit sir: Here's a short potation. Pi. But good Lyatico I assure you sir I'le be your taster to quit feare of danger, Piso drinks. And now i'le let you know we have made oath Upon this nimble master of invention This sprightly liquor to be firme, and faithfull To one another in a present project. Take you the same, and grow in one with us. Nic. May I not aske what end your project aimes at? Fra. Nor what, nor unto whoseâ Pi. Let it suffice, We carry that about us shall end you, They draw Stillettoes And presently, if you comply not with us. Nic. Nay, nay, by faire meanes Gentlemen I pray. I am apt enough to mischiefe of my selfe. Looke yee. I sweare with you. He drinks. Hor. Tis well. Now know Tis for the good of your young Master here. Nic. Then you would use me in some treachery Against my old one. Pi. Thou art a Soothsayer. Nic. Look you, i'le sweare againe, I like your oath, Your deep Lyatick oath here, wondrous well. He drinks thrice. Fab. Tis well done Nicolo: try the bottome of'tâ Nic. I will comply now and complot with you, And was indifferently prepar'd before. Provided alwayes that it tend not to Danger of's Life. Fab. Couldst thinke me such a Villaine? Nic. Nay, if it were, 'twere no disparagement To stake my head with yours. But Gentlemen, Please yee fall roundly now upon the busines, I have now sworne enough. Pi. Then you must answer To these intergatories. First do you know If the old men Guadagni and Pantaloni Doe hold their purpose for their match to morrow Betwixt Fabritio here, and Flavia? Nic. They are marying of 'em now at their Lawyers, By Deed and Covenant, under Hand and Seale. I left them, and their Bookes there now together, And for the Priest to morrow is the day. Hor. Is not Fabritio mist at home this morning? Nic. No, not at all, the old man's mind's so carried Upon the wings of this new marriage fortuneâ I cry you mercy sir, you are the Gentleman I thinke, that should have had her. Fra. In good time sir. Nic. In good time may you I'le do something for you. Fab. Honest, deserving Nic. Nic. Sir thus it is: My Master sent in my young Masters name, (The more to indeare his service and his care To the young Lady) that the Merchantesse, The rich Shee-pedler of the Merceria Should visit her to day with all her wares, For her to take her choyce to deck her Brideship; If you know how to plough now with that Heyfar You may herhaps convey a message to her. Hor. I know her, and will fit you with directions. Fra. Thou hast given a hint, for which I will renown thee. Pi. But Nicolo, where was your reverend Master Attended by your selfe before day-light? Fab. Prithee inquire not further, 'twas not he. Nic. The doubtfull light deceav'd you sir. Pi. No more then Noon ifaith, a man may spie An old whore-master in the darkest night Like an old Cat, by th' gloring of his eyes. Will his old Mutton-mongership nere leave? He is already known sufficiently Thorough the City for his gift that way; And yet he will deny his sonne free choyce, And force him marry one hee not affects. Hor. That is his drift, whereby he may inherit From him the same licenciousnesse; and make The World acknowledge him the more his Son. Pi. But has he made the purchace? has he bought The famous peece of flesh, the rare Novella? Nic. I could unshale a plot. Hor. Nere doubt but doe't then, Pi. My noble Nicolo out with't I say. Ni. I would intreat the favour of this Senate I might unfold it only unto one. Fra. Take your free choyce. Nic. To you young Master then, Take heede wee render not ridiculous Your Father to the wildnesse of their youth: But to your selfe I will disclose a secret That may be wrought to your advantage. Fab. On. Nic. Tis true, my Master was with the Novella Drawne by the loose desires of wanton flesh; But such a foule affront he did receave As justly doth provoke his dire revenge, Which he hath trusted me to execute. Fab. How Nicolo? but first what was th'affront? Nic. He bargain'd with her; and for some large price Shee yeilded to be his. But in the night In the condition'd bed was laid a Moore; A hideous and detested Blackamore, Which he (demanding light to please his eye, As old men use all motives) Discoverd and inrag'd, forsooke the house; Affrighted and asham'd to aske his coyne againe. Fab. But seekes Revenge! How, how, good Nicolo? Nic. Thus sir, you know what common disrepute Falls upon Man or Woman that is found Conversing with the common City-hangman, That nearest Kinred after such converse, Shun their society, as they would doe him (The Hangmans selfe) so odious are they held Except it be those officers allowd By the State-publick to negotiate with him. Fab. I know it Nicolo. But what can follow? Nic. Tis plotted that the Hangman shall go to her, And be discover'd with her in such sort, As her disgrace shall force her fly the City, And I have undertaken to effect it. Fab. It must be then by bribing of the Hangman: And how canst thou do that with thine own safety? Thou mayst be so discoverd and so hated. Nic. For that observe the politique invention Of my old Master! the habit of a Zaffi, One of th'inferiour Ministers of Justice, That walkes betweene the Senate, and their Friend The Executioner of their commands. Fab. But what disguise shall shrowd the Hangman thither, whose own shape is as horrid as the Plague? Nic. The habit of some stranger in the City, Which here is gold to purchace. Fab. Thou hast inform'd, Nay more thou hast inspir'd mee Nicolo! I shall find way by this, to breake the contract My Father would inforce; preserve his credit, And save the poore Novella from the same My father threatens by his own disgrace Be then but true to me. Nic. Sir, if I faileâ Fab. Enough: I'le trust thee. Keepe the gold thy self: Give me this Habit. Get thy selfe another In all points like it, and in that returne Unto my Father, confidently tell him The Hangman undertakes it, and at five, Soone in the Evening, in strangers habit, He will accost her. Nic. Sirâ Fab. I'le see't perform'd, Trust to my word and care, and thy reward. Nic. I leave all to you sir. And crave my dismission. Pi. What Has he done? Fab. Most friendly. Farewell Nicolo. Exit. Nic. He has given me plot enough, if I but worke it; And it produce not Comick sport i'th'end I must subscribe my Wit is not my Friend, I must crave your assistance Gentlemen. Hor. We have beene plotting too. Fra. And though our project run not the same way, It may conclude with yours to crown the day. Pi. So to your severall wayes. Hor. I am for the Novella. Exeunt Omnes. SCENE II. Victoria above, looking in a Glasse, Jacomo, Paulo, by-named Burgio. Vic. So I am ready: And trust me Jacconetta My pretty Moore, (for so I still must call thee For thy deare Masters sake that gave thee to me) Thou art grown skilfull in these quaint attires, So lately unacquainted with my wearing: Thou hast plaid the good beginner at this dressing, And by thine industy and further practise, I doubt not but my Knowledge will grow ripe. Pau. And by that Knowledge, you your selfe soone rotten. Aside. O! could these Creatures grow still towards ripenesse; Or, being ripe, abide so, and no further, What excellent fruit they were! Vic. VVhat say you Borgio? Pau. I say among the twenty thousand Curtezans In and about this City, none becomes The dressing, or the habit like your selfe; Your most unparalell'd selfe! But, noblest Lady, Thinke tis your person beautifies the Dresse, Not it, your person. Vic. Why not it my person? Pan. Yes, as the flame the fuell; To worke it into coales, and so to ashes. Vic. Still Borgio in your old morality! Pan. These Tires, these Chaines, these Paintings, and these Gawds Are but the sprigs and leaves the butchers use To set out flesh to sale with; or, at best, But the gay Garlands which adorne the Beast Prepar'd for Sacrificeâ Vic. Peace Borgio, peace. Pan. And as those Beasts, so senselesse are you women Of the most certaine danger you put on, With your vaine glorious gayety; chips and strawes, To kindle fire of lust, in whose lew'd flame Sinkes (with Troyes Buildings) Natures choycest Flame. Vic. I would I understood this misery! Deale freely with me Borgio, what new art Hast thou in practise, that thou setst a face Shiningly varnish'd with Divinity On a profession, that makes Nature vile In her own shame? Lust's instrument! Nay case of instruments, holding all meanes For propagation and maintaining of it; To make thy Gaine out of its dregs and fragments. Tell me, dost thinke by preaching modesty To quit thee of the basenesse of thy trade; A poore necessitous Bravo? or hast hope To live upon my honesty, and yet be still Thy selfe a Ruffiano? Pan. I would give o're, would you; and change my Function. Vic. Ha, ha, ha,â Jac. What meane you Borgio, would you now spoile all? Did you instruct her in this way of profit, And no lesse pleasant too, then profitable (As most of my Bookes titles are) whereby Shee was so well resolved to goe onâ Pan. Hold thy peace foole: shee will runne on the faster. Thou knowst not how much harme, preaching has done 'Mongst women. She will prove the only Sweep-stake In all the City. Jac. O are you there Devill? Vic. Sir, leave this grumbling, or i'le turne you off Amongst your Brothers, and your Sons Ruffianos, To lurch i'th' night betwixt eleaven and two To rob and drown for prey; till being taken Imediate Hanging followes. Pan. I'm now your Creature; My noble resolute Mistris; now I adore you: Now you shine bright; your bravery now becomes you, Yet (let me tell you under faire correction) I have some cause to hinder your desires, And theyrs that seeke you more, yet, for a time. Vic. Your reason sir? Pan. You know I was preferrd to you for a Bravo Of long and deare experience: I have serv'd Six, the most famous Dames, this City bred These sixty yeares; none scorning my advise, By which, and their endeavours they grew up To purse the price of Providences; which bestowd The most in publique, some in pious uses Purchac'd them fame, almost Canonization. The last and least of them, Margarita Emiliana Founded the Augustinian Monastry I showd you late; where shee has daily prayers. These women, whom successively I serv'd, Fell not by rash adventure unto all Great Fortunes offers; but by sound advise (Which kept their Bodies sound and 'rich'd their coffers) Were long e're they embrac'd; by which their price And beauty grew of greater estimation, My profit in this too is unneglected: For long suspense, and tedious Expectation Bring me more certaine fees; where, if you fell Imediatly to work, my work were done, And your own too, perhaps too soon: witnes the falls That Pox and Poverty have brought on many! When their youths flame was spent and they rejected, When others of their Sisterhood were embrac'd Into a wholsome Nunnery. Vic. This fellow speakes my thoughts. Borgio, I thought You had respect to your particular profit In all this winding warinesse for my good. Pan. You may conceive, 'twould grieve me, that (where now You have continuall new, and bounteous suitors, That yeild me fees for the bare sight of you) You should in yeilding to their common use Send one man cloyd away, t'affright another From his approach. Vic. Borgio, no more of this, A deare friend put you to me, for whose sake I hitherto have follow'd your advise, In hoysting up the price of my virginity. Jac. To such a rate no common purse dares venture, Nor common folkes presume t' approach the house. Vic. And such as did attempt, by offring lesse, I have sent back with shame; as the old youth Last night, for which I thanke thee Jacconetta, Jac. I thinke I coold his grave concupiscence. Vic. And therefore, doubt not, carefull Borgio, Unlesse I meet a husband by the way I will not stoope this moneth at a lesse rate, Then the proposed sum and your consent. Pau. I thanke you more then if you had possess'd Me of the value of that sum propos'd. Jac. He meanes her Maydenhead! Ifaith good sir, The mark's grown out of your old chaps, or else Hang me if I believ'd you, by that little I know of man. Vic. So now about our businesse. Some of my visitants I know are neare, Wayt circumspectly Borgio. Pau. You need not doubt me. Exit. Vic. There is some hidden vertue in this fellow, Or dangerous ill: but whether let it be; As was my Birth my purpose shall be free. Make fit my Chamber Jaconet. But first Give me my Lute; and set me for the signe Of what I meane to be, the fam'd Novella. Song. Whilst she playes and sings above, Paulo waits below: Many Gallants passe over the stage gazing at her. Piso is received in by Paulo, after him a French Cavalier, then a brave Spaniard, and after him a glorious German. Paulo takes fees of all as they enter the house. The Song ended, Paulo appeares above with Victoria. Vict. Now Borgio, how speakes your muster roll? What? are you full? Pau. I have an army royall Of Princely spirits, ready for incounter. Vic. But one at once good Borgio. Pau. I have encamp'd them each in severall quarter. Here lies the no lesse politick then stout Italian force, and there your sprightly French; Here the brave Spaniard, there the German bold; Here the Polonian, and Sclavonian there; Persian and Grecianâ Vic. Pray thee hold. No more. Pau. 'Tis not your house can hold, (would I admit 'em) One of each severall nation would throng in To make his battery on your virgin Fort. The rich Piazza, on her greatest Mart Boasts not more Nations; nor St. Marke himselfe The understanding of more Languages Then I (could I find house-roome) could receave, To be made one by your interpretation O what a Daring glasse is sparkling beauty; Fetching ambition from above the pitch Of towring Eagles, or Sky-touching Larks Down with a glance into the Nets of Love! Vic. Pray thee speake nearer home, who hast thou hous'd? Pau. I have cull'd from the pack a speciall prince; Foure glittering Gallants; one of Italy, For our deare Countries sake; But then a Monsieur, A joviall French-man, all of flame and spirit. Vic. I shall not dare to meddle with his glory For feare I fall with Simele, who next? Pau. A Spaniard next, that, to adorne his pride, Weares an Epitome of both the Indies. Vic. I saw his punctuality passe by. Pau. And did you note his stiffe reservednesse? He dares not cough for breaking of his chaine, But then there is a Dutchman, (Cargo lustick!) A jolly strong chind German, princely borne; A Landsgrave at the least; whose very bluntnesse Promises more then the sharp-set Italian, The fiery Frenchman, or the doughty Diego In all their eager pursuit. Vic. That man Burgio! You have bestowd them all in severall Roomes? Pau. O like fierce Beasts, from sent of one another. Vic. Then first, in faire requitall of the Musick, I doe imagine some of them bestowd On me, this morning e're my Love appeares To feed their eyes, let Musick feast their eares. Exeunt Om.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Piso, Victoria. Pi. Why not me, Lady? stand not I as faire, And fit for your embrace as any man? Vic. Yes sir, tis granted; and as acceptable I yeild to none. Pi. Tis but to try my Courtship, I presume, That you put on this coynesse, and to draw More ample testimony of affection, By Protestation, Prayers, Compliments; The weakest ceremonies due to love; Meere noyse and Lip-labour, with losse of time. I thinke with scorne upon such poore expressions, And am above the art of Amorists, That cringe and creepe by weake degrees of Love; To Kisse the hand, the Cheek, the Lip, then cry O Divine touch! then smirk, and then embrace, Then nuzzle in the Elizium of your bosome, And be entranc'd! meanes fit for duller spirits, To gather heat and strength of appetite. My desire speakes in Loves true dialect; And, from my heart inflam'd, you may perceive Loves fire rage in mine eyes, enough To melt to yeildingnes a frozen breast. In this I talke too much. I finde you yeilding. Vic. And I my selfe too blameâ Pi. Let us retire then. Vic. Mistake me not good Signior. Keep your distance: I blame my selfe to let you overweene By my long silence, that immodesty To be in me, that might embolden you To your and my dishonor. Pray desist, And let the friendly welcome you have found Perswade your faire construction. Pi. Is this earnest? Vic. Yes in sooth is it. Pi. I'le be playner then, What make you here i'th' Smock-Faire, precious Mistris? Or why these dressings, these perfumes and paintings? Doe you weare the habit of our Curtezans, And, by their art, call Gazers to your beauty, Full of high hopes and flames of ardent Love, Thus to delude, and make them witnesses Of a cold seeming Chastity? what new Art Is this? it cannot be to get a husband! Vic. Nor a child neither sir, that's lesse. Pi. That's soone believ'd, yet, no disparagement To your expert sufficiency in the trade: For the best Carpenters make fewest chips, There's very few of all your function fruitfull: Yet some there be approved men at armes Famous in publique service; and a many Good handy craftsmen in the Arsenall Bred by this bounteous City from such mothers That nere could boast their fathers; and as many Daughters (if they prove worthy in their feature) Succeed their active Mothers in their fortunes. Vic. You are better read then I sir. Pi. Tis common knowledge Lady. Nor do I Read this t'informe your selfe, who were instructed (I make no doubt) before your price was set, By all examples to your present practise. Vic. Sir, I must tell you now, you grow too lavish; So, as I feare foule language; to'avoyd which Let me intreat a faire departure hence. Pi. Lady, this overacted State might fit The wife of a Clarissimo, or the bashfull Daughter of some Patrician: but in you, A piece set out to sale, it but appeares Affected singularity, more unsutable To the temptations you weare about you Then th'holy seeming pictures in your Chamber. Vic. Why should it trouble you sir? Pi. It dos, to thinke what new and secret aime You may intend by this; in taking on you The habit, and the name of Curtezan: And, first, to set a price so far beyond The strength of any ordinary meanes; And then to shew a carriage that may strike Lust out of countenance! O the Knot's dissolv'd! O Oedipus! O Sphynx! I now have found it You fish for Fishermen (tis pregnant truth) Shee claps a Cardinall aboord at least: Tis not a Lay-mans purse, or Learning can, Or purchace, or confute you, ist not so? Vic. Now you are foule indeed, and I must plead My priviledge against you sir, you know I have a freedome grounded upon custome Here in this City, for a moneth to make Choyce of my Lodging, set what price I please Upon my selfe; admit what visitants I shall thinke fit; no other, nor no more; And this without controule, or least exception Of you or any man; secur'd by th' City, So safe from out-rages, that least abuse May, on my just complaint, be punishable In whomsoever by affront dares grive me. Pi. I feare shee'l prove another creature then The Beast I tooke her for: shee knows her strength. Vic. Yet thus much (for you are a Gentleman) I'le yeild for satisfaction unexacted: If in this Moneths space, in that honor'd way (For I despaire not of a husband sir) Of holy Marriage, I be not promov'd; Nor, by that time prefix'd, the great Son tenderd (Great as you terme't) for my virginity; And that I stoope for lesse, here is my hand, I will be yours as freely as mine owne At your own price. Pi, Said like a noble Wench, Onely a word by way of friendly advise, And so farewell. This Maydenhead of yours, By you so highly pris'd; now being ripe (And therein only merchantable ware) Will, if you overslip the season, grow Sodainly fulsome, streight way state, then Rotten: Think upon choycest Fruit, or Foule, or Fish, Rich Wines, or any Rarity; how soone Their vertue's lost. Vic. I am enough instructed. Pi. Once more farewellâpray ponder on these things. Vic. Feare not I shall. Pi. Could you consider how 'twould grieve a soule Indued with Reason, Knowing, the true use Of Nature's delicates, to see 'hem lost, Or spoil'd for want of seasonable taking, I know you would, and thanke me for my counsell. Vic. Indeed and so I doe. Pi. Indeed farwell then. Exit. Vic. Hee's gone, at last the tedious storme is over. I shall want day, as well as patience T'indure and answer all the rest so largely, See my sprightly Frenchman! I must looke For a hot Onset now, though a short Skirmish. Enter Horatio, like a French cavalier, Paulo presents him. Hor. Let me in my approach admire that Object That vindicates the voyce of Fame, in proving Shee was no Lyer in the lowd reports, That blaz'd it for the Beauty of the World! Vic. Good sir beware idolatry. Hor. The Egiptians, Would they forbeare their wonted heathenish worship, And fall in adoration of this faceâ Vic. Indeed i'le heare no more. Hor. Lady you must, You are so farre above the pitch of flattery That highest courtship in our best of Language Wants due expression of your supreame graces: And not to tender you the heighth of prayse Were mere Rusticity, rather prophanation. Vic. Yet. Let me stay you there, and let me tell you You have worded well your high conceipt of me, But in a way so low, so undeserving A courtiers art, that I have found you none. Hor. No Courtier Lady? Vic. No, no Courtier sir, How can it fall in courtly understanding That beauty can be conquerd by it's praise? It breeds but lesse respect, and oft times scorne From those that are ambitious of praise On such praise-givers. And if you came onely Thus to pronounce my praise, you have said enough. Hor. Nay dearest Lady, saving your displeasureâ I must come closer to her, shee'l forget Aside. Shee is a whore else. Vic. Sir, your further pleasure Hor. To tell you, Lady, now I like your wit Equally with your beauty; briefly of which A word or two, and so unto our businesse. (You tax me with the losse of time already) You doe consider fitly, that to praise What we would purchace makes the value higher: It is the chapmans rule to discommend. Vic. Right sir, were you to buy a Horse or Jewell, You would not praise it past the price propounded. Hor. Yes, where I finde the worth exceed the price. Vic. (I am betray'd. Hee brings the Money sure) Aside. Hor. And, that you know I doe esteeme your worth Above all Salary, I yeild my selfe, Fraught with unvaluable Love and Honor To be the due reward of your embraces. Vic. What's this sir, to a thousand double Duccatts? Hor. You cannot thinke so poorely, or if so, Perceive them in a taste of my endowments. First see my late composure; where the flame Of the soule-ravishing art of Poesy May light your judgement 'bove the love of money. Vic. You'l say my soule is noble, then if I (As I protest I doe) complaine the wants Of even the best professors of that art. The words are set. Hor. To notes my voyce can master? Vic. Please you to read 'hem sir, and in requitall Of such a debt, my mayd shall sing 'hem for you. Enter Jacconetta. Jacconetta, observe this Dity. Hee Reades the Song. Let not the corrupted steame Of invective breach blaspheme, Ladies for those artfull graces Which they lay upon their Faces: Ceruse and Vermillion there As aptly may be layd. As (to cover Nature bare) All other parts be clad. Be wee sick in any part, Pain'd, or Lame, we seeke to Art, (Nature's Rector) to restore Us, the strength we had before. Who can say a Ladies Face Lesse meriteth the cost, Or the priviledge, or grace Her other parts may boast? Ladyes no, since Time may steale Natures bounty, learne to heale; And with nimble hand repaire Teeth and Lips, Cheeks, Eyes and Haire; Filling wrinkles, purling veynes: That unperceav'd may be Upon your lookes, the stroakes and paines Of Age and Casualty. Vic. Now try your voyce, Maide. Jac. Sings. Hor. However 'twas well Sung, you seeme to slight In such requitall, my esteeme of you: But yet there rests in me a quality, I may suppose not so to be requited. Please you command your Musick, I will Dance, To what you first shall name of latest practise. Vic. Your skill hath made you confident; and I Do so much honour these endowments in you, That I my selfe will answer you in this. Name you the Dance sir. Hor. To come the closer to you, the Novella. Vic. I am but weakly practis'd yet in that. Hor. Some other then. Vic. No let it be the same. Goe play it Jacconetta, the Novella. Exit Jac. Hor. I doe begin to doubt my qualities Will not passe here in payment at the rate My schooling cost me, when shee repayes all I can bestow, in the same coyne againe: But since I'm in, i'le on, and make the best Both Face and Legs I can in't. Dance. Hor. How like you it Lady? Vic. For so much sir as you have excell'd me I crave your kind acceptance of my thanks. Hor. I still had rather you were pleas'd to accept Me and my whole deservings. I come to you. If you esteeme of Courtship, Language, Quality, Sorting a Gentleman of best degree, The Mixture of whose knowledge with his practise Cost thrice your golden Son; let me and those Be made the meed of your most sweet enjoying. Vic. I will not make you such a loser sir, But rather wish you had your money againe Those excellencies cost. Hor. You doe not stout me Lady? Vic. No, i'le speake plainly sir, these qualities Might on some thriving Stage, and lucky legs Bring you your money againe, winning, perhaps, The love of some old Lady, by stirring up The embers of affection, rather lust. Hor. Did ever woman talke so? Vic. But certes here They will not passe for ready money sir. Hor. I dreampt as much. Shee has a devillish wit. Vic. My curtesie sir forbids me bid you hence; But having private businesse of my own I must crave leave to leave you to the thought Of what two thousand Duccats are. Exit. Hor. Be hand'd. Enter Paulo. Pau. Is it perform'd sir? have you done the feat? Hor. Pox o'your Feates. Pau. Just as the Musick playd I warrant you Sir, 'twas a moving Lesson; playd to th'life. We struck it home, that you might do so too. Hor. The Rogue, too, jeeres me! sir I should doe well To strike, or beat your undeserv'd Fee Out of your bawdy Pocket. Pau. As if you had not done the doe you came for! What pretty wayes can Gentlemen find out To save their moneys! 'Tis worth praise in some, That have but little, or come hardly by't, By travaile, study, or laborious toyle, Deare shifts sometimes, and dangerous wayes with hazardâ Hor. Very good! Pau. But for you Gallants, that have, as it were Wealth above wit borne with you, and still growing Up with you, past the reach of your expences; And never sweat, but for your exercise, Or what your exercises bring you to! For you to thinke your pleasures costly; faine Excuse for petty fees, now the great charge Is paid, and your desire satisfiedâ Hor. No more. Pau. Alas sir, what is a poore Duccatoun After a thousand Duccats?â Hor. Ha' you done? Pau. Would you had not; 'lesse my reward were better. See, see, the bed made smoth againe and all! (O precious craft!) as here had nothing been! Well would yee were all as wise in greater matters. Hor. Tis the Rogues humor: I will give him something For abusing me. There's your Duccatoun To worke more affability in your Mistris Against my next approach. Pau. It seemes then yet You are not cloyd with her deliciousnesse. Hor. Nor had one tast (I sweare by life and honour) Of all my hopes, more then her Hand and Lips. Pau. Have you not in that a double meaning sir? Hor. I vow, for ought I know shee is a virgin. Pau. Y'have satisfied me, and perhaps my art May in your absence worke a little for you. Hor. Thinke of me then. Pau. My profit pricks me to it. Hor. Respect it then, Adieu. Exit. Pau. Serviteur Monsieur. The feare of thee is past. I was almost In a cold sweat: but all the danger now, Lyes on the tother side o'th' house; my Don My hot Goat-liver'd Diego, should he now Discharge his Pistols on her, they would prove More forcible then Cannon-shot on me. Enter Pedro Victoria. Faith quit me of suspect. How big hee lookes! As if he scorn'd repulse. If he grow violent I'le bring the Duchman in to coole his pride, And set them by the eares for our Low Countries. Exit. Ped. I have not in all Spaine (where Majesty Enthroned sits upon the brow of beauty, And crowne the Ladies with prerogative 'Bove all the women of the Earth) incountred With such a scorne, as here. Discourteous woman, Worthlesse and ignorant of the weighty trust Was tenderd to thee in my blood and honour. Vic. Your blood and honour, will not feed or cloath mee. Ped. I will not charge a word more with a mouth So full of rudenes, and mechanick basenesse. Vic. Not upon my submission sir? Ped. It must be great and sodaine if it move me. Vic. Hee lookes that I should kneele and beg a Kisse. Ped. Why seeke you not to expiate your trespasse By tender of your selfe to my embraces? Vic. I cannot doe't: My virgin Modesty Denyes that freedome. Ped. I'le no more delay, I see tis only force must conquer you. Vic. You will not ravish me! within there! help! Enter Paulo, Jacconetta. Pau. What! is the great some tender'd? Doe you want hands to tell your money Mistris? Vi. No, to take off the hands of Rape and Outrage This proud imperious Spaniard grip'd me with. Pau. Signior you must not gripe nor grope here Under the sum prefix'd; two thousand Duccats. We have arithmetique to receave them by In your own Pistolets, or peeces of Eight In Rialls, if you please; but not one single one To be abated, my most thrifty Don; Whom I cannot abuse enough me thinks, I have seene one in your shape so well presented. Ped. Villaine, i'le have thee whipp'd for this affront, Thy fault is punishable by the Law. Pau. Not in defence of honour deare Don Tarquin. Preventing Rape and Murder. Ped. Villaine die. He drawes Pistoll. Pau. Not at this distance sir, Besides here's ayd. Enter Swatzenburgh. Swa. Hence you Muskitta. Give a look more this way I'le force thee take thy wings out at the window. Ped. Borne down by Bravoes! let the place protect ye, By my few minutes patience. My revenge Shall shortly speake in thunder. Swa. Hold your peace; And vent not here your lowd Rodomontadoes Lest I spit lightning. Ped. Well sir I am silent. Pau. Be so my politique Don. This Hans has snapt her; The Dutch man carries her from your great claime: And this may be an ominous portent Against your title to the Netherlands, It may hold in the great worke sir, as well As in this small assay. Ped. Abus'd and Jeer'd! Pau. Nor they heare me not my noble Signior, I'le tell you for your satisfaction This Alinanie is a youoker that would marry her, And shee nor I durst beare it otherwise, (Knowing by chance he slipp'd into the house, And overheard us) when you come againe I will informe you further, you shall finde My information worthy of a fee. Ped. Take from my hand a peece of foure Gazetts. Pau. That's three pence sterling, you are bounteous sir, So, now, looke bigge and vanish. Exit Pedro. Vic. I have not sir, in my short story strayd In the least sillable from truth, and were The eyes of all the world fix'd upon My seeming Levity, my mind should be Still constant as the center to that end Reserv'd in my free thoughts. Swa. Why was the sum, then, of two thousand duccats Proclaim'd the price of your virginity? Vic. To keep the flesh flies off, you know my aime sir. Swa. I find the noble Lady; nor can I Further attempt a breach upon your honor. Vic. Upon those termes I pray sir be my Guest, I have by this time a slight Dinner staying. Swa. You favours make me bold. Vic. See all in readinesse Jacconet. Exit Jac. Swa. I'le drinke a frolick Lady; Mirth and good wine take me: My loose desire Is to chast love refin'd by Vesta's fire. Exit. Pau. Am I a prophet? sure the Dutchman's tane In a chast snare indeed. I did but forge it For an excuse to calme and rid the Spaniard, And he seemes to prevent my fiction: yet Presumption shall not sway me. Womens wiles Are oft times past prevention, and men catch Sence of the wrongs, which to prevent they watch. Exeunt Omnes.</field>

Fabritio like the glorious Dutchman, Horatio, Piso. Fab. Found you the Fort, then, so impregnable? Hor. Against all force of armes, or braines. Pi. No way but by the down-right composition Of the two thousand Duccats to be enter'd. Fab. Sure tis some noble wench then you imagine, But my disguise shall put her to the test. Hor. I'm sure she jeerd me out of my Monsieur ship. Fab. Did she, and all thy fine french qualities? Pis. And is as like, to make a skitter brooke Of you in your Dutch slops. For if she be not, After all this, a cunning whore, i'me couzen'd. Hor. Shee lives at a good rate how ere maintaind. Pi. The secret way, man, by her commings in Too common among women for their livings, I'le not believe her wit and feature are Allyed to honesty. Fab. Thou art no worshipper of faire women Piso. Pi. No, If I worship any of 'hem more Then in the Knee-trick, that is necessary In their true use let me be eunuchiz'd. Looke here's your fathers Pimpe againe. Hor. Now Nicolo? Nic. Saw you my young Master Gentlemen? Hor. Yes there he stands, translated out of sober Italian into high Dutch. Nic. I sweare he was past my reading, Slight, he appeares as like the noted Almaine Late come to town, if he had but his beardâ Fab. How like you this for a beard? Nic. Most excellent! But pray take heed your stay spoyle not the purpose Of your disguise. Fab. Why what news Nicolo? Nic. Your Father is in busy quest of you. Fab. Then he dos misse me? Nic. Pray PhÅbus he misse as much of Madnesse, He and his vertuous brother old Guadagni, Who misses too his Daughter. Francisco has her. Hor. Has he got her off? Nic.

Good sir! are you here too? I thank you sir, You payd me your entrance, but no parting fee. Pi. Prithee deserve no beating till thou hast done Thy errand. What dost come for? Pau. Sir, to intreat this Gentleman to bring With him one Signior Piso, and Fabritioâ Beyond my hopes! Good sir, are you here too? Fab. This is a Devill! could he know me else That nere saw him before, in this disguise? Pau. Cry mercy sir: you would not these should know Nor shall they (I feare it not) but hark you sir. Nic. What Famili are these Bawds are. They'l talke yee Thus to Lords in private. Pi. Sure he takes him for the Dutch loggerhead We saw to day in the Piazzo. Hor. So would any man: Hee has hit his shape so right. Pau. I am sure I rejoyce in these Dollore, that you Give me to day, and are as certaine, that My Mistris wish'd a better dinner for you For frighting of the Spaniard with your fireworks. But, by your strangers it seemes you repent The Marriage offer that you made my Mistres. Fortune direct you to no worse a wife, And so I leave you to your choyce. Fab. I have found the error, and will make good use on't. Hor. Your businesse then is to that strangers sirâ Pau. Only your selfe, and briefly from Francisco. Hor. Francisco! where? Pau. Where but at our house sir? he and his Bride Craving your company and those Gentlemen I nam'd unto you. Pau. For no disparagement unto their worths, sir, But private reasons yet unknown to me Wherein you shall be satisfied at your comming, Hor. But are they Married? Pau. I brought the Priest to 'em; And saw them lawfully coupled, and before Sufficient witnesses, that saw 'em chamberd, Shee was his own Church-sure before I left 'em, And he has made her Cock-sure, sir by this time, Or else he is a Bungler. Hor. Goe i'le follow thee. Piso is here. Pau. But where is that Fabritio? Pi. Wee'l finde him too. Jog you sir on before: You are no street companion for us. Pau. I am gone sirâExit. Hor. You have heard all Fabritio; what dee thinke on't? Fab. Nothing; nor nothing will till I arrive There at the full knowledge of all together. Pi. But prithee hang thy Hangmans project now, And beare us company in thine own shape. Fab. Not for the price of the Novella Piso, I'le try her to the quick. You'l give me leave To make prize of her if I can, I croft not you. Hor. We wish you safe aboard sir. Fab. On before then. Exit Hor. Piso. Now Nicolo; your disguise againe oth Zaffi. Nic.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Victoria, Francisco, Flavia, Astutta, Jacconetta. Vic. Now Lady, has your entertainment pleas'd you In the Novella's house? is all well yet? Fla. So well, that now come Father Friends, and all The friendly Foes that did oppose my blisse I can maintaine my cause in these safe armes 'Gainst all their Frownes and Furies. Vic. And your Mistris is over, too. I hope sir The place is not so dangerous as it was. Fra. Lady your noblenesse shown in this great bounty, Hath not alone wip'd off my foule suspition: But scor'd upon my breast an endlesse summe Of thanks; which I, unable to discharge, Must not presume to live, but as your Creature; Nor will I further dare to tempt your goodnesse In deeper search of what your reason was (Past all my hopes and wishes) to provide For me; I will not sum in such a scruple: For sure, I hold you for a power Divine (Past all the fictions of the fabulous times Fashioning out the Gods in earthly formes) Sent by the highest providence to helpe me. Vic. You take too deepe a sense of curtesie! But see, are these your friends? Enter Paulo, with Horatio, and Piso. Fra. And let me beg Your suffrage Lady, I may bid them welcome. Vic. Your Bride and I will both supply you in it. Neither of these is he they call Fabritio? Pau. No, but hee's sent for; and comes instantly. Exit Fra. This is the Lady I am bound to serve. Hor. And I to honour. Vic. Setting aside your suit sir. Hor. I cannot promise that. Vic. And I doe wish I had her double price in ready Duccats, For what she has done, and tother doe besides. Vic. You still stand in your good conceit of me. Pi. Yes, and I would so stand to't, haâ Vic. You are a merry Gentleman. Fra. I will not whisper it, Horatio, The woman that I dealt with for disguise Was wrought before by this most matchlesse Lady To crosse the Match twixt Flavia and Fabritio; And had undone it though I had done nothing, And ere she would condition with me, Oblig'd me, by an oath, (in case we scap'd) To bring her hither to this Ladies house. I kept that oath, and here you find us welcom'd. Pi. Then thou hast done't, would I had still the Duccats To pledge thee here. Enter Paulo, whispers with Victoria. Vic. Wee'l talke of that hereafter. Pi. What acted you, Tit, in this Comedy? Ast. The Chambermayde, a kind of putter forwards, Sir, to the businesse. Fra. Shee has done so well, That, if a Match in Venice may be found By my best care, i'le helpe her to a Husband, For shee deserves a good one. Ast. And if he prove not so, I am like to prove A good one my selfe, and make him something. Pi. Thou wilt, I find it in a villanous cast Of that eye there. Hor. And what thinke you of this? By Jacconetta. Pi. Even such another, of another hue, Shee has a devilish gloat too. Vic. Gallants, I find you merry, y'are more welcome: My man acquaints me with a present businesse Requiring privacy. Please you, with your friends Goe up to the Bride-chamber. There is musick. Waite you respectively. To Jac. Hor. Wee'l all observe you Lady. Exeunt. Pi. But Lady, if you receive the Duccats Before you come to us, pray bring our shares, Wee all connive you know. Vic. Pray be not jealous, Follow your Friends, i'le follow you streight way. Ex. Pi. How dreames he of this money? he knows nothing, An English Factor, say you Borgio? Pau. Yes Mistris, a brave fellow. Vic. And is he so well money'd as to spare Out of his Masters trust, so great a summe? Pau. Oh hee's a master here himselfe. They are Abroad, the royallst Nation of the World. What rich Venetian Rarity has not The English Money-masters purchac'd from Princes and States, to beare home as their triumphs? And for their pleasuresâbut i'le say no more; Hee thinks I stay too long for him to wait Without, with so much money. Vic. Didst thou see't? Pau. Most brightly shining! Hee's now telling it In the next roome! He comes not to tender The value of it in fine qualities Like your suppos'd Monsieur: but in cash! Cash! cash of Gold! Oh tis a tempting sight; Able to damne a Noble womans honour. What's your descent? But poore I make no question; Why, this will set you up and make you noble. Vic. This way of his might serve to turn the blood That has but any tincture of good in it From touching such a bait, yet he thinks now He spurres me to it. But Bravo I will fit you. Goe call him in, goe. Pau. Now my Blood and Braine, Be strong and sodaine, stay. Vic. Why stop you Borgio? Pau. To see him weigh his gold. Oh dainty sight! He brought his weights in's pocket: just Gentleman He will be sure you shall not want a graine Of your full price of sweet damnation. Vic. Hee's doing no such thing. Pau. No, no, I have it now. Vic. I pray thee goe, thou knowst not how the thought Of so much gold, and the conceit o'th' Maydenhead Lost i' the house to day sets my virginity On edge now to be going. Pau. Are you so ready? then I fly. Enter above, Piso, Horatio. Vic. What ayles the fellow troe! Pi. I must yet have an eye upon this female To quit my jealousy, or catch her i'th' nick. Hor. Here we may see, and heare all undiscover'd. Pi. Watch close, he comes. Enter Swatzenburg, like a Marchant with a full Bagge. Swa. By your leave Lady, I come not a pure Sutor (VVith studyed Oratory; nor addresse a Sonnet, Or trifling Love-toyes to perswade admittance By slow degrees into your inmost favour) But a rich purchacer, that brings, at once, The golden Summe, and Price of your enjoying. Here precious Beauty, made by this more precious! Take your full due, and render readily The full tuition of my wealthy purchace. Vic. Now vertue guard me. Pi. VVhat's that? Hor. Shee invokes vertue. Swa. Ha! why this delay? Let not the glorious sight of this amaze you, Though it be granted, sodaine apprehension Of such bright blessings may transport a soule Into high raptures, when it is considerd, The Ornament of youth, the strength of age, Lifes great maintainer, Lady, let not this At all transmute you. For i'le bring supplies That shall so frequently acquaint you with Such sights as these, that you shall grow regardlesse Even of the care to keepe them, in respect Of the delicious pleasure brings them in: Delay not therefore that high purchac'd pleasure, That brings this to you, by a Minutes losse To make it fully yours. Vic. Sir I have heard you. Enter Paulo behinde with pistolls. And now must let you know, tis not the sight Of that your glorious summe can take my wonder; Much lesse my love or person: my amazement Is, that a man, that beares his Makers shape, Indued with reason, to direct and governe That goodly fortune; and has such treasure given him (Besides his greater blessings of the mind By well desposing of it) to advance This worth in deeds of vertue, should descend Below the sense of Beasts, to part with that, Allotted for his livelyhood and honour To wast it, and himselfe in beastiall Lust. Swa. How's this? Pi. I know not what to make o'this wench. Shee preaches me thinks: Vic. Besides sir, were it well examin'd, The golden summe you tender is, perhaps, None of your proper own: I understand You are anothers Factor, I presume In all your Catalogue of Merchandise You finde no warrant to buy Maydenheads. Is such a thing in all your bills of Lading? They are no way transportable tho' you allow For fraught and leakage halfe the worth; and lesse Returnable by way of exchange. How can You take up a virginity in Venice, And make a London payment of it, on Sight of your bill, or six or ten dayes after? Pi. Good! Swa. Nay then you dally with me, and I must Deale plaine and briefly with you. Here's the price, And either render me my just demand, Or I shall take for your disgrace an order Shall spue you forth the City. Vic. Now I feare I am insnar'd. I have but one way left To fly from shame, or fall to utter Ruine. Pi. I begin to suspect her honest. Swa. Your answer Gentlewoman. Vic. Gentle sir, The Law hath made me yours. And I have now No Court but Conscience to relieve me in. Kneels Swa. What may this meane? Vic. If the strong passion of a Virgin soule, Exprest in bitterst teares, move not your pitty, This shall prevent your cruelty. A Knife Pi. Shee'l prove honest o' my life. Swa. What meane you Lady? Vic. Keepe at that distance sir, and you shall know: Come nearer, and I will not live to tell you. Swa. Pray rise and speak your story: yet I tell you, I hold it very strange, that so much money And such a one as I (none of th'unhandsomst) Should not goe down with a young wench, and one Of the profession you pretend to be of Before cold Iron! Me thinks most unnaturall. Thinke better yet before you utter further. Vic. Indeed I may not. Swa. Well, well, on then. Vic. Tis true, I am indeed a meere pretender To the profession you suppos'd me of; A spotlesse Virgin (by my utmost hopes) And will remaine so till I am a Bride. Pi. Too honest to be a woman! Swa. Why tooke you this deceiving habit then? Vic. I am about to tell you for your pitty, I am a Romane borne, of good discent; My father noble (of the Candiani) How ere decay'd in fortune, ere he dyed; Which drew on my Misfortune: For, being betroth'd Unto a wealthy heire, here, of this City, Who sojourn'd then in Rome, his covetous Father Ravishd his faith from me, to give't another; And calld him hastily from Rome to Venice. I followd him, in hope to crosse the Match, And so regaine him; towards which already, I have done something. Pi. Fabritio's wench my life on't. Swa. VVhat in this habit, as a Curtezan? Vic. Not without good advise: For, by this meanes I draw the eyes of all the youthfull Gentry, Not without hope to gaine a sight of him. My price and port keepe back inferiour persons. Nor lose I honour by it: For the strictnes Of our Italian censure gives a virgin, That held familiarity with any Man, By way of Marriage treaty, and then forsaken, Lost in repute; shee is no honest woman Untill that man doe vindicate her honor. Swa. But should hee finde you here, what were his censure? Vic. Here he should find what his disloyalty Had wrought me to; and should restore me firme On my first basis, or exchange a life For mine ere we would part. Swa. This sounds yet well. Pau. I'le trust thee now. Thou art a noble wench, Thou hadst kiss'd Death by this else. Now i'le trust thee. Exit. Vic. If he were lost by Marriage of another, I would remove with such a testimony Of my reserved honour (in despight Of this my outward carriage, for my ends; Maugre the sterne construction of my countrey) That strangers should receive me; and some one More noble then himselfeâ Swa. Take you to wife? Vic. I should not doubt. Swa. Tis done, and I am he that does it. Vic. I cannot sir, but kindly take your offer: But, if my first love faile me, there is one, A noble German, that commenc'd his suit To me this day. Swa. I am he too LadyâLooke well upon me That in this shift, reducing of my beard, VVith this supply of money came to try you, I finde you noble, and above it, honest. Pi. This is the German that Fabritio apes. Hor. And he should come now. Enter Jacomo to them above. Jac. Gentlemen forbeare; Indeed it is not civill in you to pry beyond Your hospitable usage, pray forbeare. Hor. Tis timely chidden wench, we will obay thee. Jac. Besides the Bridegroome, and the Bride expect you. Pi. O ha they done we come, we come. Exit Hor. Pi. Vic. This jealous tryall now of yours (how ere You have exprest strong arguments of love) Has not augmented you in my affection. Swa. O say not so sweete Lady, i'le redeeme it. Vic. I cannot yet believe you are the Man, You are so chang'd from what you seem'd to day, Must the minde alter with the outward habit? Enter Paulo. Pau. Mistris the Germanâ Vic. Here he is man, he sayes. Pau. I say he is without, and craves to see you. Vic. How can this be? or who can I believe? Pau. Good sir depart and make roome for your selfe Your proper selfe to enter the Dutch Prince. Swa. I tell thee I am he, and here already, I am Swatzenberg. Pau. Yes in your tother beard sir. Hans Snortanfart, are you not? well I can but warn you, If you will needs stand to the taking off A mans good name from him before his face, Then take what followes, I will fetch him in Mistris, you were best be out of sight a while: Your presence with this stranger may whet up his fury To cut all our throats else. Vic. I'le take your councell. Exit. Pau. For sir i'le tell you, if you had but seene How he worried a Spaniard to day, you would Have beene able at your returne to make As many of your Countreymen, as thrive By serving of the States to laugh ifaith. Swa. I tell thee I am he; 'twas I that chac'd The Spaniard hence. Pau. I tell you yet againe You were best be gone before the He indeed Come in to chace you after him. Swa. I'le stand the hazard. Pau. See his impatience pulls him in already. Enter Fabritio in the Germans habit. Fab. Where is this Lady? Dos her beauty flie me? Pau. Shee is at hand, but first here is a stranger, A most strange stranger that sayes he is you sir. Swa. Was oder wer bistu? Bistu ein Deutscher? Sag mihr in was ort Du gelebst hast? Fab. Who's this? Swa. Ich denke du bist ein heuchler; bistu aber ein Deutscher so anwort mihr in deutscher sprach. Fab. Good sir speake in the proper language of The Nation we are in, though it come brokenly From you that this good fellow here may understand us. Swa. Thou son of impudence, and imposture, speake; What is thy end in this? Fab. Thinke what thine owne must be, thou son of slander. Swa. Precious counterfeit! But I am weaponlesse, and must fetch strength Of officers to right me. Exit. Fab. What dos your shame remove you sir? Pau. What can this Rascall meane? Swa. I care not honest fellow, where's thy Mistris? Good Angells guard me. Enter Victoria. Pau. Dos shee fright you sir? Fab. I aske thee for thy Mistris, the Novella. Pau. What appeares shee to you? Fab. Thou powerfull man in Magick, I will tell thee. Th'hast rays'd an apparition, that has damn'd thee Blacker, then thy black art; nay hell it selfe. Pau. Blesse us! more madnesse yet! Fab. The heavenly spirit, that inspir'd this forme, (When the unworthy world enjoyd her being, VVhich thou hast conjur'd into this lewd habit) Has, at this instant won the powers above To sinke thee and thy sorcerers. Pau. VVhat may you meane? Here is no sorcery, This woman's Flesh and Blood. Fab, I would not dare to try to be the Duke. Pau. You may depart, pray hinder not the house. Fab. Hadst thou but seen, as I have, one like her, And noted the divinity in her lookes (Although in those adulterate incitements Shee seemes to wear) she would have struck thy soule VVith fervent adoration, not base lust. Pau. I know not what to say to 'him. Bell rings. Vic. See who rings. Exit Paulo. VVhat divine creature, sir, was that you mention'd? Fab. I dare to name her to thee, though thou be Her incens'd Ghost, to worke me to despaire, It was Victoria. Vic. This sounds most strangely! Have you beene at Rome sir? Fab. 'Twas there I saw and lov'd her. Vic. Answer me pray sir, why could not this fall In your discourse to day, when I related My Life and Fortune to you? why do you start? I am no shadow; but suspect you rather, To be not as you seeme, the noble German That vowd me love, dos that too startle you? See sir, to prove I am no aery spirit, I'le trust your hand (if you be mortall substance) VVith so much flesh and blood as may resolve you. Fab. I find tis she, and having found her thus Shee's lost for ever, and my selfe no lesse, That was the cause of this her desperate fortune. Vic. VVhat's that you say? what aile you sir? how ist? And what moves thy destraction? Borgio, speak. Enter Paulo. Pau. Horror and shame invades us, all the house Is round beset with officers. The Magistrates Are entring now, for what, or whom they search I cannot guesse, unlesse this be some Murderer Slipt in, to draw our lives in question. Vic. Deale plainly sir, what are you? hee's stupified! Pau. The Spanyard's with 'hem too that took th'affront By the supposed Dutchman here to day; And he that fain'd himselfe to be that Dutchman Desires their aid against this unknown person. Enter Pantaloni, Pedro, Guadagni, Swatz. Prospero, Checquino, Zaffi, Pedler-woman. Gua. This is the house you say. Ped. And this is the Gentlewoman. Gua. Give me my Daughter, Harlot. Vic. Here's no such creature, here sir, if she be Your Daughter, this woman directed hither, Shee is no Harlot, but an honest Bride; Lawfully wed and bedded; as may appeare By the strong testimony of divers friends: Call them all downe. Exit Paulo. Pant. Unheard-of impudence! Are Bawdes, and VVhores Fit Matchmakers for Magnificoe's Daughters? Vic. Speake lower, or at home sir, you know not VVhat we are: Harke you sirâyour last nights triall Did not enough informe you. Pant. VVe shall know more anon; I'th' meane time what are you? Fab. A stranger sir. Pant. VVe shall know more of that anon too. Ped. This is the stranger, that affronted me; 'Gainst whom I crave your Justice. Pant. You shall know more anon too. Swat.

My ends were faire, though in this uncouth way Tho' (heaven I beg thy pardon) as my care Was to preserve her life and more her honour; Fearing her violent and abused spirit, Might have made wrack of either, or of both, I once had secret purpose to have ta'ne Her Life, in case shee had forsooke her honour; And with her cut off Candianies Line, Which now branch'd here, may touch the worlds end With faire succession!
