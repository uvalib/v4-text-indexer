      <field name="fulltext">THE PLEASANT COMÅDIE OF Patient Grissill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter the Marquesse, Pauia, Mario, Lepido, and huntsmen: all like Hunters. A noyse of hornes within. Marquesse. Looke you so strang my hearts, to see our limbes Thus suited in a Hunters liuery? Oh tis a louely habite, when greene youth Like to the flowry blossome of the spring, Conformes his outward habite to his minde, Looke how yon one ey'd wagoner of heauen, Hath by his horses fiery winged hoofes, Burst ope the melancholy Iayle of Night, And with his gilt beames cunning Alchimy, Turn'd al these cloudes to gold, who (with the winds) Upon their misty shoulders bring in day: Then sally not this morning with foule lookes, But teach your Iocond spirits to ply the Chase, For hunting is a sport for Emperors. Pau. We know it is, and therefore doe not throw On these your pastimes, a contracted brow, How swift youths Bias runs to catch delights, To me is not vnknowne: no brother Gualther, When you were woo'd by vs to choose a wife, This day you vowed to wed: but now I see, Your promises turne all to mockerie. Lepi. This day your self appointed to giue answere To all those neighbour-Princes, who in loue Offer their Daughters, Sisters and Allies, In marriage to your hand: yet for all this The houre being come that calles you to your choyce You stand prepard for sport and start aside: To hunt poore deere when you should seeke a Bride. Marq. Nay come Mario your opinion too, H'ad neede of ten men's wit that goes to woe. Ma. First satisfie these Princes, who expect Your gracious answere to their embassies, Then may you freelie reuell: now you flie Both from your owne vowes, &amp; their amitie. Marq. How much your iudgmens erre: who gets a wife Must like a huntsman beate vntrodden pathes, To gaine the flying presence of his loue. Looke how the yelping beagles spend their mouthes So Louers doe their sighes: and as the deare, Out-strips the actiue hound, &amp; oft turnes backe To note the angrie visage of her foe, Who greedy to possesse so sweet a pray, Neuer giues ouer till he ceaze on her, So fares it with coy dames, who great with scorne Shew the care-pined hearts, that sue to them Yet on that feined slight, (Loue conquering them) They cast an eye of longing backe againe, As who would say, be not dismaid with frownes, For though our tongues speake no: our hearts sound yea, Or if not so, before theile misse their louers, Their sweet breathes shal perfume the Amorous ayre And braue them still to run in beauties Chase: Then can you blame me to be hunter like, When I must get a wife? but be content, So yo'ule ingage your faith by othe to vs, Your willes shall answere mine, my liking yours, And that no wrinckle on your cheekes shall ride, This day the Marquesse vowes to choose a bride. Pa. Euen by my honor, Marq. Brother be aduis'd, The importunitie of you and these, Thrusts my free thoughts into the yoake of loue, To grone vnder the loade of marriage, Since then you throwe this burthen on my youth Sweare to me whome soeuer my fancie choose, Of what discent, beautie or birth she be, Her you shall like and loue as you loue me. Pa. Now by my birth I sweare, wed whome you please, And Ile imbrace her with a brothers arme. Lepi. Mario and my selfe to your faire choice, Shall yeeld all dueties and true reuerence. Marq. Your protestations please me Iollilie, Lets ring a hunters peale, and in the eares Of our swift forrest, Cittizens proclaime, Defiance to their lightnes: our sports done, The Uenson that we kill shall feast our bride, If she proue bad, ile cast all blame on you, But if sweet peace succeede this amorous strife, Ile say my wit was best to choose a wife. Exeunt. As they goe in, hornes sound &amp; hollowing within: that done, Enter Ianicolo, Grissil, and Babulo, with two baskets begun to be wrought. Bab. Olde Master heeres a morning able to make vs worke tooth and naile (marrie then we must haue victualls) the Sun hath plaid boe peep in the element anie time these two houres, as I doe some mornings wh? you cal: what Babulo say you: heere Master say I and then this eye opens, yet don is the mouse, lie still: what Babulo sayes Grissil, anone say I, and then this eye lookes vp, yet downe I snug againe: what Babulo say you againe, and then I start vp, and see the Sunne, and then sneeze, and then shake mine eares, and then rise, and then get my breakfast, and then fal to worke, and then wash my hands, and by this time I am ready: heer's your basket, and Grissill heer's yours. Ian. Fetch thine own Babulo, lets ply our busines. Bab. God send me good lucke Master. Gri. Why Babulo, what's the matter? Bab. God forgiue mee, I thinke I shall not eate a pecke of salt: I shall not liue long sure, I should be a rich man by right, for they neuer doe good deedes, but when they see they must dye, and I haue now a monstrous stomacke to worke, because I thinke I shall not liue long. Ian. Goe foole, cease this vaine talke and fall to worke. Bab. Ile hamper some body if I dye, because I am a basket maker. Exit. Ian. Come Grissill, worke sweet girle, heere the warme Sunne will shine on vs, And when his fires begin, Wee'll coole our sweating browes in yonder shade. Gri. Father, me thinkes it doth not fit a maide, By sitting thus in view, to draw mens eyes To stare vpon her: might it please your age, I could be more content to worke within. Ian. Indeed my childe, mens eyes do now adaies, Quickly take fire at the least sparke of beauty, And if those flames be quencht by chast disdaine, Then their inuenom'd tongues (alacke) doe strike, To wound her fame whose beauty they did like. Gri. I will auoide their darts and worke within. Ian. Thou needst not, in a painted coate goes sin, And loues those that loue pride; none lookes on thee, Then keepe me companie: how much vnlike Are thy desires to manie of thy sex? How manie wantons in Saliuia, Frowne like the sullen night, when their faire faces Are hid within doores: but got once abroad, Like the proud Sun they spred their staring beames. They shine out to be seene, their loose eyes tell, That in their bosomes wantonnes doe dwell: Thou canst not doe so Grissill, for thy Sun, Is but a Starre, thy Starre, a sparke of fire, Which hath no power t'inflame doting desire: Thy silkes are thrid-bare russets: all thy portion Is but an honest name: that gon thou art dead, Though dead thou liu'st, that being vnblemished. Gris. If to die free from shame be nere to die, Then Ile be crownd with immortallitie. Ian. Pray God thou maist: yet childe my iealous soule Trembles through feares, so often as mine eyes Sees our Duke court thee: and when to thine eares He tunes sweet loue-songs: oh beware my Grissill He can prepare his way with gifts of golde, Upon his breath, winged Promotion flies Oh my deare Girle trust not his sorceries, Did he not seeke the shipwracke of thy fame? Whie should he send his tailors to take measure Of Grissils bodie: but as one should say, If thou wilt be the Marquesse concubine, Thou shalt weare rich attires: but they that thinke, With costly garments, sins blacke face to hide, Weare naked brauerie and ragged pride. Gris. Good father doe not shake your age with feares Although the Marquesse sometimes visit vs, Yet all his words and deedes are like his birth, Steept in true honor: but admit they were not, Before my soule looke black with speckled sinne, My hands shal make me pale deathes vnderling, Ian. The musick of those words sweet? mine eares Come girle lets faster worke: time apace weares. Enter Babulo with his worke. Gris. Come Babulo why hast thou staid so long? Ba. Nay why are you so short, Masters heeres monie I tooke (since I went) for a cradle: this yeare I thinke be leape yeare, for wom? doe nothing but buy cradles, by my troth I thinke the world is at an end, for as soone as we be borne we marrie: as soone as we marrie we get children, (by hooke or by crooke gotten they are) children must haue cradles, and as soone as they are in them, they hop out of th?, for I haue seene little girls that yesterday had scarce a hand to make them ready, the next day had worne wedding rings on their fingers, so that if the world doe not ende, we shall not liue one by another: basket making as all other trades runs to decay, and shortly we shall not be worth a butten, for non in this cutting age sowe true stitches, but taylers and shoomakers, &amp; yet now and then they tread their shooes a wrie too. Ia. Let not thy tongue goe so: sit downe to worke And that our labour may not seeme to long, Weele cunningly beguile it with a song. Ba. Doe master for thats honest cousonage. The Song. Song. Art thou poore yet hast thou golden Slumbers: Oh sweet content! Art thou rich yet is thy minde perplexed? Oh punnishment. Dost thou laugh to see how fooles are vexed? To ad to golden numbers, golden numbers. O sweet content, o sweet &amp;c. Foote Worke apace, apace, apace, apace: Honest labour beares a louely face, Then hey noney, noney: hey noney, noney. Canst drinke the waters of the Crisped spring, O sweet content! Swim'st thou in wealth, yet sinck'st in thine owne teares, O punnishment. Then hee that patiently wants, burden beares, No burden beares, but is a King, a King, O sweet content, &amp;c. Foot. Worke apace, apace, &amp;c. Enter Laureo. Ba. Weep master, yonder comes your Sonne Ian. Laureo my Sonne? oh heauen let thy rich hand Poure plentious shewers of blessing on his head. Lau. Treble the number fall vppon your age, Sister? Gri. Deare brother Laureo welcome home. Ba. Master Laureo (Ianiculaes sonne) welcome home, how doe the nine muses, Pride, couetousnes, enuie, sloth, wrath, gluttonie and letcherie? you that are Schollers, read how they doe. Lau. Muses: these (foole) are the seauen deadly sins. Ba. Are they: Mas me thinkes its better seruing th?, then your nine muses, for they are starke beggers. Ian. Often I haue wisht to see you heere, Lau. It grieues me that you see me heere so soone. Ian. Why Laureo dost thou grieue to see thy father, Or dost thou scorne me for my pouertie. Ba. He needes not, for he lookes like poore Iohn himselfe, eight to a necke of Mutten, is not that your commons, &amp; a Cue of breade? Lau. Father I grieue my young yeares to your age, Should adde more sorrowe. Ian. Why sonne whats the matter? Lau. That which to thinke on makes me desperate. I that haue chargd my friends, and from my father Puld more then he could spare, I, that haue liud, These nine yeares at the Uniuersity, Must now for this worlds deuill: this angell of golde, Haue all those daies and nights to beggerie solde, Through want of money, what I want I misse, Who is more scorn'd then a poore: scholler is? Bab. Yes three things: Age, wisdome, &amp; basket makers Gri. Brothers what meanes these words? Lau. Oh I am mad. To thinke how much a Scholler vndergoes, And in th'ende reapes naught but pennurie. Father I am inforced to leaue my booke, Because the studie of my booke doth leaue me, In the leane armes of lancke necessitie. Hauing no shelter (ah me) but to flie Into the sanctuarie of your aged armes. Bab. A trade, a trade, follow basket-makeing, leaue bookes and turne block-head. Ian. Peace foole, welcome my sonne, thogh I am poore My loue shall not be so: goe daughter Grissill, Fetch water from the spring to seeth our fish. Which yester day I caught: the cheare is meane, But be content, when I haue solde these Baskets, The monie shall be spent to bid thee welcome: Grissill make hast, run and kindle fire. Exit. Grissill. Ba. Goe Grissill Ile make fire, and scoure the kettle, its a hard world when schollers eate fish vpon flesh daies Exit. Ba. Lau. Ist not a shame for me that am a man, Nay more, a scholler to endure such neede, That I must pray on him, whome I should feede? Ian. Nay grieue not Sonne, better haue felt worse Come sit by me while I worke to get bread, And Grissill spin vs yearne to cloath our backs. Thou shalt reade doctrine to vs for the soule, Then what shall we there want, nothing my sonne For when we cease from worke euen in that while, My song shall charme griefes eares and care beguile. Enter Grissill running with a Pitcher. Gris. Father as I was runaing to fetch water, I saw the Marquesse with a gallant traine Come riding towards vs, O see where they come. Enter Marquesse, Pauia, Mario, Lepido, two Ladies and some other attendants. Mar. See where my Grissill, and her father is, Me thinkes for beautie shining through those weedes, Seemes like a bright starre in the sullen night. How louely pouertie dwels on her backe, Did but the proud world note her as I doe, She would cast off rich robes, forsweare rich state, To cloth them in such poore abiliments, Father good fortune euer blesse thine age. Ian. All happiness attend my gracious Lorde. Marq. And what wish you faire Maide? Gris. That your high thoughts. To your contentment may be satisfied. Mar, Thou wouldst wish soe, knewst thou for what I come Brother of Pauia beholde this virgin, Mario Lepido is she not faire? Pa. Brother I haue not seene so meane a creature, So full of beautie. Mar. Were but Grissils birth, As worthie as her forme, she might be held A fit companion for the greatest state. Lau. Oh blindnes, so that men may beautie finde, They nere respect the beauties of the minde, Mar. Father Ianicola whats hee that speake? Ian. A poore despised scholler and my Sonne. Mar. This is no time to holde dispute with schollers Tell me in faith olde man what dost thou thinke, Because the Marquesse visits thee so oft? Ian. The will of Princes subiects must not serch, Let it suffice, your grace is welcome hither. Marq. And ile requite that welcome if I liue, Grissill suppose a man should loue you dearely, As I know some that doe, would you agree To quittance true affection with the like. Gri. None is so fond to fancie pouertie. Mar. I say there is: come Lords stand by my side, Nay brother you are sped and haue a wife, Then giue vs leaue that are all Batchelers, Now Grissil, eye vs well and giue your verdicte, Which of vs three you holde the proprest man, Gri. I haue no skill to iudge proportions. Marq. Nay then you iest, women haue eagles eyes, To prie euen to the heart, and why not you? Come, we stand fairely, freely speake your minde, For by my birth, he whome thy choice shall blesse, Shall be thy husband. Mar. What intends your grace? Lepi. My Lord I haue vowed to leade a single life, Marq. A single life? this cunning cannot serue, Doe not I know you loue her I haue heard? Your passions spent for her, your sighes for her, Mario to the wonder of her beautie, Compiled a Sonnet. Mar. I my Lord write sonnets? Marq. You did intreate me to intreate her father, That you might haue his daughter to his wife. Lep. To anie one I willingly resigne, All interest in her, which doth looke like mine, Mar. My Lorde I sweare she nere shall be my bride, I hope sheele sweare so too being thus denide, Marq. Both of you turn'd Apostataes in loue, Nay then Ile play the cryer: once, twice, thrice, Speake or shee's gone els: no, since twill not be, Since you are not for her, yet shee's for me. Pau. What meane you Brother? Marq. Faith no more but this: By loues most wondrous Metamorphosis, To turne this Maide into your Brothers wife, Nay sweet heart looke not strange I doe not iest, But to thine eares mine Amorous thoughts impart, Gualter protests he loues thee with his heart, Lau. The admiration of such happines, Makes me astonisht. Gris. Oh my gracious Lord, Humble not your high state to my lowe birth, Whome not worthy to be held your slaue, Much lesse your wife. Marq. Grissill that shall suffice, I count thee worthie: olde Ianicola, Art thou content that I shall be thy Sonne? Ian. I am vnworthy of so great a good. Marq. Tush tush talk not of worth, in honest tearmes Tell me if I shall haue her? for by heauen Unlesse your free consent alowe my choice, To win ten kingdomes Ile not call her mine. Whats thy Sonnes name? Ian. Laureo My gracious Lord. Marq. Ile haue both your consents: I tell ye Lords, I haue wooed the virgin long, oh manie an houre, Haue I bin glad to steale from all your eyes, To come disguis'd to her: I sweare to you, Beautie first made me loue, and vertue woe, I lou'd her lowlynes, but when I tride What vertues were intempled in her brest, My chast hart swore that she should be my bride. Say Father, must I be forsworne or noe? Ian. What to my Lord seemes best to me seemes so Marq. Laureo whats your opinion? Lau. Thus my Lorde. If equall thoughts durst both your states conferre, Her's is to lowe, and you to high for her, Marq. What saies faire Grissill now? Gris. This doth she say, As her olde Father yeeldes to your dread will, So she her fathers pleasure must fulfill. If olde Ianicola make Grissill yours, Grissill must not deny, yet had she rather, Be the poore Daughter still of her poore Father. Marq. Ile gild that pouertie, and make it shine, With beames of dignitie: this base attire, These Ladies shal teare of, and decke thy beautie In robes of honour, that the world may say, Uertue and beautie was my bride to day. Mar. This meane choice, will distaine your noblenes Marq. No more Mario then it doth disgrace The Sunne to shine on me. Lep. Shee's poore and base. Marq. Shee's rich: for vertue beautifies her face. Pau. What will ye world say when the trump of fame Shall sound your high birth with a beggers name? Marq. The world still lookes a squint, &amp; I deride His purblind iudgement; Grissill is my Bride, Ianicola, and Laureo: father, brother, You and your Son grac'd with our royall fauour, Shall liue to outweare time in happines. Enter Babulo. Ba. Master I haue made a good fire: sirha Grissill, the fishe Ian. Fall on thy knees thou foole: see heeres our duke Ba. I haue not offended him, therefore Ile not ducke and he were ten Dukes. Ile kneele to none but God and my Prince. Lau. This is thy Prince, be silent Babulo, Bab. Silence is a vertue, marie tis a dumbe vertue: I loue vertue that speakes, and has a long tongue like a belweather, to leade other vertues after: if he be a Prince, I hope hee is not Prince ouer my tongue, snailes, wherefore come all these: Master heeres not fish enough for vs, Sirha Grissill the fire burnes out. Marq. Tell me my loue what pleasant fellow is this? Gris. My aged Fathers seruant my gracious Lorde. Bab. How, my loue: master a worde to ye wise, scillicet me my loue. Marq. Whats his name, Bab. Babulo Sir is my name. Marq. Why dost thou tremble so? we are al thy friends Bab. Its hard sir for this motley Ierkin, to find friendship with this fine doublet. Marq. Ianicola bring him to Court with thee. Bab. You may be asham'd to lay such knauish burden vppon olde ages shoulders: but I see they are stooping a little, all crie downe with him: He shall not bring me sir, ile carrie my selfe. Marq. I pray thee doe, Ile haue thee liue at court, Ba. I haue a better trade sir, basketmaking, Marq. Grissill I like thy mans simplicitie, Still shall he be thy seruant Babulo, Grissill thy mistresse, now shall be my wife. Bab. I thinke sir I am a fitter husband for her. Marq. Why shouldst thou think, I wil make her rich Bab. Thats al one sir, beggers are fit for beggers, g?tlefolkes for g?tlefolkes: I am afraid yt this w?der of ye rich louing ye poor, wil last but nine daies: old M bid this merrie gentlem? home to dinner, you shal haue a good dish of fish sir: &amp; thank him for his good wil to your daughter Gris. for ile be h?gd if he do not (as manyrichcogging march?ts) now a daies doe when they haue got what they would, giue her the belles, let her flye. Gri. Oh beare my Lord with his intemperate tongue Marq. Grissill I take delight to heare him talke. Bab. I, I, y'oare best take mee vp for your foole: are not you he, that came speaking so? to Grissill heere, doe you remember how I knockt you once for offering to haue a licke at her lips. Marq. I doe remember it and for thy paines, A golden recompence ile giue to thee. Bab. Why doe, and ile knock you as often as you list. Marq. Grissill this merrie fellow shall be mine, But we forget our selues, the daie growes olde. Come Lords cheare vp your lookes &amp; with faire smiles, Grace our intended nuptials: time may come, When all commaunding loue your hearts subdue, The Marquesse may performe as much for you. Exeunt. Enter Farneze, Vrcenze, and Rice meeting them running. Far. Rice how now man? whether art yu gallopping? Ric. Faith euen to finde a full maunger: my teeth water till I be mounching, I haue bin at the Cutlers, to bid him bring away Sir Owens rapier, and I am ambling home thus fast, for feare I am driuen to fast. Vrc. But Sirha Rice, when's the day? will not thy master Sir Owen and Signior Emulo fight? Ric. No, for Signior Emulo has warn'd my Master to the court of Conscience, and theres an order set downe, that the coward shall pay my Master good words weekelie, till the debt of his choller be runne out. Far. Excellent, but did not Emulo write a challenge to Sir Owen. Rice. No he sent a terrible one, but hee gaue a sexton of a Chuch a groate to write it, and hee set his marke to it, for the gull can neither write nor reade. Ric. Ha ha, not write and reade? why I haue seene him pul out a bundle of sonnets writen, &amp; read them to Ladies. Far. He got th? by heart Vrcenze, &amp; so deceiu'd the poor soules: as a gallant whome I know, cozens others: for my briske sp?gled babie wil come into a Stationers shop, call for a stoole and a cushion, and then asking for some greeke Poet, to him he falles, and there he grumbles God knowes what, but Ile be sworne he knowes not so much as one Character of the tongue. Ric. Why then its greeke to him. Far. Ha, ha, Emulo not write and read? Ric. Not a letter and you would hang him. Vrc. Then heele neuer be saued by his book. Ric. No nor by his good workes, for heele doe none. Signiors both, I commend you to the skies, I commit you to God, adew. Far. Nay sweet Rice a little more, Ric. A little more will make me a great deale lesse, house keeping you know is out of fashion: vnlesse I ride post, I kisse the post: in a worde ile tell you all, challenge was sent, answered no fight, no kill, all friends, all fooles, Emulo coward, Sir Owen braue man, farewell, dinner, hungrie: little cheare, great great stomacke, meate meat, meate, mouth, mouth, mouth, adue, adue, adue. Exit. Vrc. Ha, ha, adue Rice, Sir Owen belike keepes a leane Kitchin. Far. What els man, thats one of the miserable vowes he makes when hee's dubd: yet he doth but as manie of his brother knights doe, keepe an ordinarie table for him and his long coate follower. Vrc. That long coate makes the master a little king, for whersoeuer his piece of a follower comes hopping after him, hees sure of a double guarde. Far. Ile set some of the Pages vpon thy skirts for this Vrc. I shall feele them no more then so many fleas, therefore I care not: but Farneze youle prooue a most accomplisht coxecombe. Far. Oh olde touch lad, this yonker is right Trinidado pure leafe Tobacco, for indeed hee's nothing purffe, reeke, and would be tried (not by God and his countrie) but by fire, the verie soule of his substance and needes would conuert into smoke. Vrc. Hee's Steele to the backe you see, for he writes Challenges. Far. True, and Iron to the head, oh theres a rich leaden minerall amongst his braines, if his skull were well digd, Sirha Vrcence, this is one of those changeable Silke gallants, who in a verie scuruie prid, scorne alschollers, and reade no bookes but a looking glasse, and speake no language but sweet Lady, and sweet Signior and chew between their teeth terrible words, as though they would coniure, as complement and Proiects, and Fastidious, &amp; Caprichious, and Misprizian, and the Sintheresis, of the soule, and such like raise veluet tearmes. Vrc. What be the accontrem?ts now of these gall?ts? Far. Indeed thats one of their fusti? outl?dish phrases to, marrie sir their accontrem?ts, are al ye f?tasticke fashions, yt can be taken vp, either vp? trust or at second hand. Vrc. Whats their quallities? Far. None good, these are the best: to make good faces: to take Tobacco well, to spit well, to laugh like a wayting Genllewoman, to lie well, to blush for nothing, to looke big vpon little fellowes, to scoffe with a grace, though they hane a verie filthie grace in scoffing, and for a neede to ride prettie and well. Vrc. They cannot choose but ride well, because euerie good wit rides them. Far. Heere's the difference, that they ride vpon horses, and when they are ridden they are spur'd for asses, so they can crie wighee and hollow kicking iade, they care not if they haue no more learning then a Iade. Enter Emuloes Sir Owen talking, Rice after them eating secretly. Vrc. No more of these Iadish tricks: heere comes the hobbie horse. Far. Oh he would daunce a morrice rarely if hee were hung with belles. Vrc. He would iangle vilanously. Far. Peace lets incounter them. S. O. By Cod Sir Emuloes, sir Owen is clad out a crie becaus is friends with her, for Sir Owen sweare, did her not sweare Rice? Ric. Yes forsooth. Spit out his meate. S. Ow. By Cod is sweare terrible to knog her pade, and fling her spingle legs at plum trees, when her come to fall to her tagger and fencing trigs, yes faith and to breag her shins did her not Rice? Ric. Yes by my troth Sir. S. Ow. By Cods vdge me is all true, and to giue her a great teale of blouddie nose, because Sir Emuloes you shallenge the prittish Knight, Rice you knowe Sir Owen shentleman first, and secondly knight, what apox ale you Rice, is shoke now? Ric. No sir I haue my fiue sences and am as wel as any man. S. O. Well here is hand, now is mighty friends. Emu. Sir Owen Far. Now the gallimaufrie of language comes in. Emu. I protest to you, the magnitude of my condolement, hath bin eleuated the higher to see you and my selfe, two gentlemen. S. Ow. Nay tis well knowne Sir Owen is good shentleman, is not Rice? Ric. He that shall deny it Sir ile make him eate his words. Emu. Good friend I am not in the Negatiue, bee not so Caprichious, you misprize me, my collocution t?deth to S. Owens dignifiing. Fra. Lets step in, God saue you Singnior Emulo. Vrc. Well encountred S. Owen. S. O. Owe, how do you S. Em. is frends out a cry now but Emuloes take heede, you match no more loue trigs to widdow Gwenthyans, by Cod vrdge me, that doe so must knoge her, see you nowe? Em Not so tempestious sweet knight: though to my disconsolation, I will obliuionize my loue to the welch widdowe, and doe heere proclaime my delinquishment, but sweet Signior be not to Diogenicall to me, Sir O. Ha ha is knowe not what genicalls meane, but Sir Owen will genicall her, and her tag her genicalling Gwenthyan. Far. Nay faith weele haue you sound friends indeede, otherwise you know, Signior Emulo, if you should beare all the wrongs, you would be our Athlassed. Emu. Most true. Sir O. By god is out a crie friends, but harg Farneze, Vrcenze twag a great teale to Emuloes: Ow. is great teale of frends: ha ha is tell fine admirable shest, by Cod Emuloes, for feare S. Owen, knog her shines, is tell, Sir Owen by tozen shentlemen her pooets is put about with lathes, ha, ha, serge her serge her. Fa. No more tell Vrcenze of it: why should you two fall out for the loue of a woman, considering what store we haue of them? Sir Emulo I gratulate your peace, your company you know is precious to vs, and weele bee merrie, and ride abroad: before god now I talke of riding, Sir Owen me thinkes has an excellent boote. Vrc. His leg graces the boote. S. Ow. By God is fine leg and fine poote to: but Emulas leg is petter, and finer, and shenglier skin to weare. Emu. I bought them of a pennurious Cordwainer, &amp; they are the most incongruent that ere I ware. S. Own. Congruent? sploud what leather is congruent, spanish leather? Emu. Ha ha, well Gentlemen I haue other proiects becken for me, I must disgresse from this bias, and leaue you: accept I beseech you of this vulgar and domestick complement. Whilst they are saluting, Sir Owen gets to Emuloes leg and puls downe his Boote. Sir. O. Pray Emuloes let her see her congruence leather ha ha, owe what a pox is heere: ha, ha, is mag a wall to her shins, for keep her warme? Fa. Whats heer lathes? where's the lime &amp; hair Emulo, Ric. Oh rare, is this to saue his shins? S. Ow. Ha, ha, Rice goe call Gwenthyan, Ric. I will master dahoma, Gewnthyan dahoma? S. Ow. A pogs on her goe sedge her and call her within Ric I am gone sir. Exit Rice. Fa. Nay sir Owen what meane you? S. Ow. By Cod is meane ta let Gwenthyan see what bobie foole loue her, apogs on you. Emu. Sir Owen and Signiors both, doe not expatiate my obloquie, my loue shall bee so fast conglutinated to you. S. Ow. Cods plud, you call her gluttons, Gwenthyan, so ho Gwenthyan? Emu. Ile not disgest this pill, Signiors adieu. You are Fastidious and I banish you. Exit Emulo. Enter Gwenthyan. Fa. Gods so, heere comes the widdow, but in faith Sir Owen say nothing of this. S Ow. No goe to th?, by Cod Sir Owen beare as praue minde as Emprour. Gwe. Who calles Gwenthyan so great teale of time? Vrc. Sweet widdow euen your countrieman heere. S. Ow. Belly the ruddo whee: wrage witho, Mandag eny Mou du ac whellock en wea awh. Gwe. Sir Owen gramarrye whee: Gwenthyan Mandage eny, ac wellock en Thawen en ryn mogh. Far Mundage Thlawen, oh my good widdow gabble that we may vnderstand you, and haue at you. S. Ow. Haue at her: nay by Cod is no haue at her to, Is tawge tn her prittish tongue, for tis fine delicates tongue, I can tell her. welshe tongue is finer as greeke tongue. Far. A bakte Neates tongue is finer then both. S. Ow, But what saies Gwenthyans now? will haue Sir Owen, Sir Owen is knowne for a wiselie man, as any since Adam and Eues time, and that is by Gods vdge me a great teale agoe. Vrc. I thinke Salomon was wiser then Sir Owen. S. Ow. Salomons had prettie wit: but what say you to King Tauie: King Tauie is well knowne was as good musitions, as the pest fidler in aul Italie, and King Tauie was Sir Owens countrieman, yes truely a prettish shentlemen porne, and did twinckle, twinckle, twinckle, out a crie vpon welsh-harpe, and tis knowne Tauie loue Mistris Persabe, as Sir Owen loues Gwenthyan: will her haue Sir Owen now? Far Faith widdow take him, Sir owen is a tall man I can tell you. S. ow. Tall man, as God vnde mee, her thinke the prittish shentelman, is faliant as Mars that is the fine knaues, the poets say the God of pribles &amp; prables, I hope widdowe you see little more in Sir owen then in Sir Emuloes, say shal her? haue her now, tis faliant, as can desire, I warrant her. Gw. Sir owen, Sir owen, tis not for faliant, Gwenthyan care so much, but for honest and fertuous, and louing and pundall to leade her haue her will. S. owe. God vdge mee, tage her away to her husband, and is led her haue her will owd a crie, yet by God is pridle her well enoughe. Gw. Well S. owen, Gwenthyan is going to her cozen Gualther the Duke, for you knowe is her neere cozen by marriage, by tother husband that pring her from Wales. ow. By Cod Wales is better countrie then Italies, a great teale so better. Gw. Now if her cozen Gwalther say Gwenthyan tage ths pritish knight, shall loue her diggon: but must haue her good will: marg your thad Sir owen. ow. Owe whats else: Sir owen marg yt ferrewel, yet shall tage her downe quiglie inough, come widdowe will wag to the coward, now to her cozen, and bid her cozen tell her minde of Sir owen. Gw. Youle man Gwenthyan Sir owen? ow. Yes by Cod and prauely to, come Shentlemans you'le tag paines to goe with her? Far. Weele follow you presently Sir owen. S. ow. Come widdow: Vn lod dis Glane Gw?thy? mondu Gw. Gramercie wheeh, Am a Mock honnoh. Exeunt. Far. So this wil be rare: Sirrah Vrcenze, at the marriage night of these two, insteede of Io Hymen, we shall heere hey ho Hiemen, their loue will bee like a great fire made of bay leaues, that yeeldes nothing but cracking noise, noise. Vrc. If she misse his crowne tis no matter for crackking, Far. So she soader it againe, it will passe currant. Enter Onophrio and Iulia walking ouer the Stage. Vrc. Peace heere comes our faire mistris. Far. Lets haue a fling at her. Vrc. So you may, but the hardnes is to hit her. Ono. Farewel Farneze you att?d wel vp? your mistris, Iul. Nay, nay, their wages shall be of the same colour that their seruice is of. Far. Faith mistris would you had trauelled a little sooner this way, you should haue seene a rare comedy acted by Emulo. Vrc. Euerie courteous mouth will be a stage for that, rather tell her of the welch tragedie that's towards. Iul. What Tragedie? Far. Sir Owen shall marrie your couzen Gwenthyan, Iul. Ist possible: oh they two will beget braue warriours: for if she scolde heele fight, and if he quarrell sheele take vp the bucklers: shee's fire and hee's brimstone, must not there be hot doeings then thinke you? On. Theyle prooue Turtles, for their hearts being so like, they cannot choose but bee louing. Iul. Turtles: Turkie-cocks, for Gods louelets intreate the Duke my brother, to make a lawe, that wheresoeuer Sir Owen and his Ladie dwell, the next neighbour may alwaies be Constable, least the peace bee broken, for theyl'e doe nothing but crye arme, arme, arme. Far. I thinke sir Owen would die rather then loose her loue Iul. So thinke not I. On. I should for Iulia, if I were Iulies husband. Iul. Therefore Iulia shal not be Onophries wife, for Ile haue none die for me. I like not that coloure. Far. Yes for your loue you would Iulia. Iul. No nor yet for my hate Farneze. Vrc. Would you not haue men loue you sweet mistris? Iul. No not I, fye vpon it sweet seruant. On. Would you wish men to hate you? Iul. Yes rather then loue me, of al saints I loue not to serue mistris Venus. Far. Then I prceiue you meane to leade apes in hell. Iul. That spitefull prouerbe was proclaim'd against them that are marryed vpon earth, for to be married is to liue in a kinde of hell. Far. I as they doe at barlibreake. Iul. Your wife is your ape, and that heauie burthen wedlocke, your Iacke an Apes clog, therefore ile not bee tyed too't: Master Farneze, sweet virginitie is that inuisible God-head that turns into Angells, that makes vs saints on earth and starres in heauen: heere Uirgins seeme goodly, but there glorious: In heauen is no wooing yet all there are louely: in heauen are no weddings yet al there are louers. On. Let vs sweet Madame turne earth into heauen, by being all louers heere to. Iul. So we doe to an earthly heauen we turne it. On. Nay but deare Iulia, tel vs why so much you hate, to enter into the lists of this same combat Martimonie? Iul. You may well call that a combat, for indeede marriage is nothing else, but a battaile of loue, a friendly fighting, a kinde of fauourable terrible warre: but you erre Onophrio in thinking I hate it I deale by marriage as some Indians doe the Sunne, adore it, and reuerence it, but dare not stare on it, for feare I be starke blinde: you three are batchellers, and being sicke of this maidenhead, count al thinges bitter, which the phisicke of a single life minnisters vnto you: you imagine if you could mak the armes of faire Ladies the spheres of your hearts, good hearts, then you were in heauen: oh but Batchilers take heede, you are no sooner in that heauen, but you straite slip into hell. Far. As long as I haue a beautifull Ladie to torment me, I care not. Vrc. Nor I the sweetnes of her lookes shall make me rellish any punnishment. On. Except the punnishment of the horne Vrcenze, put that in. Iul. Nay hee were best put that by: Lord, Lord, see what vnthrifts this loue makes vs? if he once but get into our mouthes, hee labours to turne our tongues to clappers, and to ring all in, at Cupids Church when we were better to bite off our t?gues, so we may thrust him out, Cupid is sworne enemie to time, &amp; he that looseth time I can tell you looseth a friend. Far. I, a bald friend. Iu. Therefore my good seruants if, you weare my liuerie, cast of this loose vpper coate of loue: bee ashamde to waite vppon a boy, a wag, a blinde boy, a wanton: My brother the Duke wants our companies, tis Idlenes and loue, makes you captaines to this solitarines, followe me &amp; loue not, &amp; ile teach you how to find libertie. All. We obey to follow you, but not to loue you, no renounce that obedience. Exeunt Enter the Marquesse and Furio. Marq. Furio. Fur. My Lorde. Marq. Thy faith I oft haue tride, thy faith I credit For I haue found it sollid as the rocke: No babbling eccho sits vpon thy lips, For silence euen in speach, doth seale them vp, Wilt thou be trustie Furio to thy Lorde? Fur. I will. Marq. It is enough, those words I will, Yeelds sweeter musicke then the gilded sounds, Which chatting parrats long toung'd sicophants, Send from the organs of their siren voice, Grissill my wife thou seest beare in her wombe, The ioy of marriage: Furio I protest, My loue to her is as the heate to fire, Her loue to mee as beautie to the Sunne, (Inseperable adiuncts) in one word, So dearely loue I Grissill, that my life Shall end, when she doth ende to be my wife. Fur. Tis well done. Marq. Yet is my bosome burnt vp with desires, To trie my Grissils patience, Ile put on A wrinckled forehead, and turne both mine eyes, Into two balles of fire, and claspe my hand Like to a mace of Iron, to threaten death. But Furio when that hand lifts vp to strike, It shall flie open to embrace my loue, Yet Grissill must not knowe this: all my words, Shall smack of wormewood, all my deeds of gall, My tongue shall iarre, my hart be musicall, Yet Grissill must not knowe this? Enter Grissill. Fur. Not for me, Marq. Furio My triall is thy secrecie, Yonder she comes: on goes this maske of frownes, Tell her I am angrie: men men trie your wiues, Loue that abides sharpe tempests, sweetely thriues. Fur. My Lorde is angry. Gris. Angry? the heau?s fores?d: with wh?? for what? Is it with mee? Fur. Not me. Gris. May I presume, To touch the vaine of that sad discontent, Which swels vpon my deare Lords angrie browe? Marq. Away away, Gris. Oh chide me not away, Your handmaid Grissill with vnuexed thoughts, And with an vnrepining soule, will beare The burden of all sorrowes, of all woe, Before the smallest griefe should wound you so. Marq. I am not beholding to your loue for this, Woman I loue thee not, thine eyes to mine Are eyes of Basiliskes, they murder me. Gris. Suffer me to part hence, Ile teare them out, Because they worke such treason to my loue. Marq. Talke not of loue I hate thee more th? poyson That stickes vpon the aires infected winges, Exhald vp by the hot breath of the Sunne, Tis for thy sake that speckled infamie, Sits like a screech-owle on my honoured brest, To make my subiects stare and mocke at mee, They sweare theyle neuer bend their awfull knees, To the base issue of thy begger wombe, Tis for thy sake they curse me, raile at me, Thinkst thou then I can loue thee (oh my soule) Why didst thou builde this mountaine of my shame, Why lye my ioyes buried in Grissills name? Gri. My gracious Lorde. Marq. Call not me gracious Lorde, See woman heere hangs vp thine auncestrie, The monuments of thy nobillitie, This is thy russet gentrie, coate, and crest Thy earthen honors I will neuer hide, Because this bridle shall pull in thy pride. Gris. Poore Grissill is not proud of these attires, They are to me but as your liuerie, And from your humble seruant when you please, You may take all this outside, which indeede Is none of Grissills, her best wealth is neede, Ile cast this gaynesse of, and be content To weare this russet brauerie of my owne, For thats more warme then this, I shall looke olde, No sooner in course freeze then cloth of golde. Marq. Spite of my soule sheele triumph ouer mee. Fur. Your gloue my Lord, Marq. Cast downe my gloue againe, Stoope you for it, for I will haue you stoope, And kneele euen to the meanest groome I keepe. Gris. Tis but my duetie if youle haue me stoope, Euen to your meanest groome my Lord ile stoope. Marq. Furio how slouenly thou goest attir'd? Fur. Why so my lorde? Marq. Looke heere thy shooes are both vntide, Grissill kneele you and tye them. Fur. Pardon me. Marq. Quickely I charge you, Gris. Friend you doe me wrong, To let me holde my Lord in wrath so long, Stand still Ile kneele and tye them: what I doe Furio tis done to him and not to you. Tye them. Fur. Tis so. Marq. Oh strange oh admirall patience, I feare when Grissills bones sleepe in her graue, The world a second Grissill nere will haue, Now get you in. Gris. I goe my gracious Lord. Exit Marq. Didst thou not here her sigh, did not one frown Contract her beautious forehead. Fur. I saw none Marq. Did not one drop fal downe fr? sorrowes eies, To blame my heart for these her iniuries? Fur. Faith not a drop, I feare sheele frowne on mee, For doeing mee seruice? Marq. Furio that ile trie, My voice may yet ore-take her: Grissill, Grissill? Enter Grissill. Fur. She comes at first call. Gris. Did my Lorde call? Marq. Woman I cald thee not, I said this slaue was like to Grissill, Grissill, And must you therefore come to torture mee? Nay stay here's a companion fit for you, Thou vexest me, so doth this villaine to, But ere the Sun to his highest throne ascend, My indignation in his death shall end. Gris. Oh pardone him my Lord, for mercies wings Beares round about the world the fame of Kings, Temper your wrath I beg it on my knee, Forgiue his fault though youle not pardon mee, Marq. Thanke her. Fu. Thankes Madame. Marq. I haue not true power, To wound thee with deniall, oh my Grissill, How dearely should I loue thee, Yea die to doe thee good, but that my subiects Upbraid me with thy birth, and call it base, And grieue to see thy Father and thy Brother Heau'de vp to dignities. Gris. Oh cast them downe, And send poore Grissill poorely home againe, High Cedars fall, when lowe shrubs safe remaine. Exit Enter at the same doore Mario and Lepido. Mari. Fetch me a cup of wine. Fur. Shees a saint sure. Marq. Oh Furio now ile boast that I haue found, An Angell vpon earth: she shalbe cround The empresse of all women. Lepido? Mario? what was she that passed by you? Both. Your vertuous wife. Marq. Call her not vertuous, For I abhorre her, did not her swolne eyes Looke red with hate or scorne? did she not curse My name or Furioes name? Mari. No my deare Lord. Marq. For he and I raild at her, spit at her, Ile burst her heart with sorrow, for I grieue To see you grieue that I haue wrong'd my state, By louing one whose basenes now I hate. Enter Grissill with wine. Come faster if you can forbeare Mario, Tis but her office: what she does to mee, She Shall performe to any of you three, Ile drinke Lep. I am glad to see her pride thus trampled downe Marq. Now serue Mario, then serue Lepido: And as you bowe to me, so bend to them. Gris. Ile not deni't to win a diademe. Mari. Your wisdome I commend that haue ye power To raise or throw downe as you smile or lower. Gris. Your patience I commend that can abide, To heare a flatterer speake yet neuer chide. Marq. Hence, hence dare you controule th? whome I grace Come not within my sight. Gris. I will obey, And if you please, nere more beholde the day. Exit. Marq. Furio? Fur. My Lorde, Marq. Watch her where she goes, And marke how in her lookes this tryeall shewes. Fur. I will. Exit. Marq. Mario, Lepido, I loath this Grissill, As sicke men loath the bitterest potion Which the Phisitions hand holdes out to them, For Gods sake frowne vpon her when she smiles, For Gods sake smile for ioy to see her frowne, For Gods sake scorne her, call her beggers brat, Torment her with your lookes, your words your deedes, My heart shall leape for ioy, that her heart bleedes, Wilt thou doe this Mario? Mari. If you say. Mario, doe this I must in it obey. Marq. I know you must, so Lepido must you Tis well; but counsell me whats best to doe, How shall I please my subiects? doe but speake, Ile doe it though Grissils heart in sunder breake. Lepi. Your subiects doe repine at nothing more, Then to beholde Ianicola her Father, And her base brother lifted vp so high. Mari. To banish them from Court were pollicie. Marq. Oh rare, oh profound wisedome, deare Mario, It foorthwith shall be done, they shall not stay, Though I may win by them a Kingdomes sway, Exit Lep. Mario laugh at this. Ma. Why so I doe. Hedlong I had rather fall to miserie. Then see a begger rais'd to dignitie. Exeunt. Enter Babulo singing with a boy after him. Bab. Boy how sits my rapier: la sol la sol. &amp;c. Boy. It hangs as euen as a chandlers beame. Bab. Some of them deserue to hang vpon a beame for that euennes, boy learne to giue euery man his due, giue the hangman his due, for hee's a necessary member. Boy. Thats true, for he cuts of manie wicked m?bers. Bab. Hees an excellent barber, he shaues most cleanly But page how dost thou like the Court? Boy. Prettilie and so, Bab. Faith so doe I pretlie and so: I am wearie of being a Courtiour Boy. Boy. That you cannot bee Master, for you are but a Courtiers man. Bab. Thou saist true &amp; thou art the Courtiers mans boy, so thou art a courtier in decimo sexro in the least volume, or a courtier at the third hand, or a courtier by reuersion, or a courtier three descents remoued, or a courtier in minoritie or an vnder Courtier or a courtier in posse, and I thie Master in esse: Boy. A posse an esse non este argumentum Master, Bab. Thou hast to much wit to be so little, but imitation, imitation, is his good Lord and Master. Enter Ianicola Laureo and Furio. Ian. Banisht from Court, oh what haue wee misdone? Lau. What haue wee done, wee must bee thus disgraced? Fu. I know not, but you are best packe, tis my Lords will, and thats law, I must vncase you: your best course is to fall to your owne trades. Ba. Sirra, what art thou a Broker? Fu. No, how then, I am a Gentleman. Ba, Th'art a Iewe, th'art a Pagan: howe darst thou leaue them without a cloke for the raine, wh? his daughter, and his sister, and my Mistris is the Kings wife? Fu. Goe looke, sirra foole, my condition is to ship you too. Bab. There's a ship of fooles ready to hoyst sayle, they stay but for a good winde and your company: ha ha ha, I wonder (if all fooles were banisht) where thou wouldst take shipping. Ian. Peace Babulo, we are banisht from the Court. Bab. I am glad, it shall ease me of a charge heere, as long as we haue good cloathes on our backes, tis no matter for our honesty, wee'll liue any where, and keep Court in any corner. Enter Grissill. Ian. Oh my deere Grissill. Gri. You from me are banisht, But ere you leaue the Court, oh leaue I pray Your griefe in Grissils bosome, let my cheekes Be watred with woes teares, for heere and heere, And in the error of these wandring eyes, Began your discontent: had not I been, By nature painted thus: this had not been, To leaue the Court and care be patient, In your olde cottage you shall finde content. Mourne not because these silkes are tane away, You'll seeme more rich in a course gowne of gray, Fur. Will you be packing? when? Lan. Friend whats thy name? Fur. Furio my name is, what of that? Bab. Is thy name Furie? thou art halfe hang'd, for thou hast an ill name. Lau. Thy lookes are like thy name, thy name &amp; lookes Approoue thy nature to be violent. Gris. Brother forbeare, hee's seruant to my Lord. Ba. To him, M. spare him not an inch. Lau. Princes are neuer pleas'd with subiects sinnes, But pitie those whom they are sworne to smite, And grieue as tender mothers when they beate, With kinde correction their vnquiet babes So should their Officers compassionate, The misery of any wretches state. Fur. I must obey my Master, though indeed My heart (that seemes hard) at their wrongs doth bleed. Pray get you gone, I say little, but you knowe my minde. Bab. Little said is soone amended, thou say'st but little, and that little will be mended soone indeed, thats neuer, and so the Prouerbe stands in his full strength, power and vertue. Enter Marquesse, Mario and Lepido, and attendantes. Fur. They will not goe my Lord. Marq. Will they not goe? Away with them, expell them from our Court, Base wretches, is it wrong to aske mine owne? Thinke you that my affection to my wife, Is greater then my loue to publicke weale? Doe not my people murmure euerie houre, That I haue rais'd you vp to dignities? Doe not lewde Minstrels in their ribalde rimes, Scofe at her birth, and descant on her dower? Ian. Alas my Lord, you knew her state before. Marq. I did, and from the bounty of my heart, I rob'd my wardrop of all precious robes, That she might shine in beautie like the Sunne, And in exchange, I hung this russet gowne, And this poore pitcher for a monument, Amongst my costliest Iemmes: see heere they hang, Grissill looke heere, this gowne is vnlike to this? Gris. My gratious Lord, I know full well it is. Ba. Grissill was as pretty a Grissill in the one as in the other. Marq. you haue forgot these rags, this water pot. Gris. With reuerence of your Highnes I haue not. Ba. Nor I, many a good messe of water grewell has that yeelded vs. Marq. Yes, you are proude of these your rich attyres. Gris. Neuer did pride keep pace with my desires. Marq. Wel, get you on, part brieflie with your father. Ian. Our parting shall be short, daughter farewell. Lau. Our parting shall be short, sister farewell. Ba. Our parting shall be short, Grissill farewell. Ian. Remember thou didst liue when thou wert poor, And now thou dost but liue, come sonne no more. Marq. See them without the Pallace Furio. Fu. Good, yet tis bad. Exeunt with Furio. Ba. Shall Furio see them out of the Pallace? doe you turne us out of doores? you turne vs out of doores then? Marq. Hence with that foole, Mario driue him hence. Ba. He shall not neede, I am no Oxe nor Asse, I can goe without driuing, for al his turning, I am glad of one thing. Lep. Whats that Babulo? Bab. Mary that hee shall neuer hit vs ith teeth with turning vs, for tis not a good turne, follower I must cashere you: I must giue ouer houskeeping, tis the fashion, farewell boy. Boy. Marie farewell and be hang'd. Ba. I am glad thou tak'st thy death so patiently, farewell my Lord, adue my Lady, great was the wisedome of that Taylor, that stitcht me in Motley, for hee's a foole that leaues basket making to turne Courtier: I see my destiny dogs me: at first I was a foole (for I was borne an Innocent) then I was a traueller, and then a Basket-maker, and then a Courtier, and now I most turne basket-maker and foole againe, the one I am sworne to, but the foole I bestowe vpon the world, for Stultorum plena sunt ominia adue, adue. Exit. Mar. Farewell simplicity, part of my shame farewell, Now Lady what say you of their exile? Gri. Whateuer you thinke good, Ile not terme vile, By this rich burthen in my worthles wombe, Your hand-maide is so subiect to your will, That nothing which you doe, to her seemes ill. Mar. I am glad you are so patient, get you in, Exit Gr. Thy like will neuer be, neuer hath bin. Mario, Lepido? Mario, Lepi. My gratious Lord. Mar. The hand of pouerty held downe your states, As it did Grissils, and as her I rays'd, To shine in greatnes sphere, so did mine eye, Through gilt beames of your births, therfore me thinkes Your soule should simpathize, and you should know, What passions in my Grissils bosome flowe, Faith tell me your opinions of my wife? Lep. She is as vertuous and as patient, As innocence, as patience it selfe. Mari. She merits much of loue, little of hate, Onely in birth she is vnfortunate. Marq. I, I, the memory of that mirth doth kill me, She is with childe you see, her trauaile past, I am determined she shall leaue the Court, And liue againe with olde Ianicola. Both. Therein you shew true wisedome. Marq. Doe I indeed? Deare friends it shall be done, Ile haue you two Rumour that presently, to the wide eares Of that newes-louing-beast the multitude, Goe tell them for their sakes this shall be done. Mari. With wings we flye. Lep. Swifter then time we run. Exeunt. Marq. Begone then: oh these times, these impious times, How swift is mischiefe? with what nimble feete Doth enuy gallop to doe iniury? They both confesse my Grissils innocence, They both admire her wondrous patience, Yet in their malice and to flatter me, Head-long they run to this impiety. Oh whats this world, but a confused throng Of fooles and mad men, crowding in a thrust To shoulder out the wise, trip downe the iust. But I will try by selfe experience, And shun the vulgar sentence of the base, If I finde Grissill strong in patience, These flatterers shall be wounded with disgrace, And whilst verse liues, the fame shall neuer dye, Of Grissils patience, and her constancy. Exit. Enter Vrcenze and Onophrio at seuerall doores, and Farnezie in the mid'st. Far. Onophrio and Vrcenze early met, euery man take his stand, for there comes a most rich purchase of mirth: Emulo with his hand in a faire scarfe, and Iulia with him, she laughes apace, and therefore I am sure hee lyes apace. Enter Emulo with Iulia. Ono. His arme in a scarfe? has he been fighting? Far. Fighting? hang him coward. Vrc. Perhaps he does it to shew his scarfe. Far. Peace, heere the asse comes, stand aside, and see him curuet. Iul. Did my new maried cousen Sir Owen wound you thus? Emu. Hee certes, as he is allyed to the illustrious Iulia. I liue his deuoted, as Signior Emuloes enemy, no adulatory language can redeeme him from vengeance: if you please my most accomplisht Mistris, I will make a most palpable demonstration of our battaile. Iul. As palpably as you can good seruant. Ono. Oh she gulles him simply. Far. She has reason, is he not a simple gull? Vrc. Sound an allarum ere his battle begin. Farn. Peace, sa, sa, sa. Emu. Sir Owen and my selfe encountring, I vailde my vpper garment, and enriching my head againe with a fine veluet cap, which I then wore, with a band to it of Orient Pearle and Golde, and a foolish sprig of some nine or ten pound price, or so, wee grewe to an emparleance. Far. Oh ho ho, this is rare. Iul. You did wisely to conferre before you combated. Emu. Uerily we did so, but falling into the handes of bitter words, we retorted a while, and then drew. Ono. True, his gloues to saue his hands. Vrc. No, his hand-kercher to wipe his face. Far. He sweat pittifully for feare, if it were true: if, Emu. I was then encountred with a pure Toledo siluered: and eleuating mine arme, in the drawing (by Iesu sweete Madame, my rich cloake loaded with Pearle, which I wore at your sister Grissils bridall, I made it then (by God) of meere purpose, to grace the Court, and so foorth) that foolish garment dropped downe: the buttons were illustrious and resplendant diamonds, but its all one. Far. Nay, they were all scarce one. Emu Diuine Lady as I said, we both lying, Fa. Ile be sworne thou dost. Emu. I must recognize and confesse very generouslie, and heroycallie at our ward, the welsh Knight making a very desperate thrust at my bosome, before God fairely mist my imbroydered Ierkin that I then wore, and with my ponyard vapulating and checking his engine downe, it cut mee a payre of very imperiall cloth of golde hose, at least thus long thwart the cannon, at least. Iul. And mist your leg? Fa. I, and his hose too. Emu. And mist my leg (most bright starre) which aduantagious signe I ( ) this legge (hauing a fayre carnation silke stocking on) stumbled, my spangled garters in that imprision fell about my feete, and he fetching a most valarous and ingenious careere, inuaded my Rapier hand, entred this gilded fort, and in that passado vulnerated my hand thus deepe I protest, and contest heauen. Iul. No more, its too tragicall. Emu. I conclude, I thought (by the Syntheresis of my soule) I had not been imperished, till the bloud shewing his red tincture, at the top of a faire enneloped gloue, sunke along my arme, &amp; spoil'd a rich wastecoate wrought in silke and golde, a toy &amp;c. Far. Hee'll strip himselfe out of his shirt anone, for Gods sake step in. Emu. My opinion is I shall neuer recuperate the legittimate office of this member my arme. All 3. Signior Emulo. Emu Sweet and accomplisht Signiors. Far. Ha ha, Madame you had a pitiful hand with this foole, but see he is recouered. Iu. But seruant where is your other hand? Ono. See sweet mistris one is my prisoner. Vrc. The other I haue tane vp with the fine finger. Iul. Looke in his scarfe Farneze for an other, hee has a third hand, and tis pitifully wounded hee tels me, pitifully, pitifully. Far. Wounded, oh palpable, come a demonstration of it. Ono. Giue him your larded cloake Signior to stop his mouth, for he will vndoe you with lyes. Vrc. Come Signior, one fine lye now to apparrell all these former, in some light sarcenet robe of truth: none, none, in this mint? Iul. Fye seruant, is your accomplisht Courtship nothing but lyes? Ono. Fye Signior, no musicke in your mouth, but battles, yet a meere milke-sop. Vrc. Fye Emulo, nothing but wardrop, yet heare all your trunckes of suites? Far. Fye Signior, a scarfe about your necke, yet will not hang your selfe to heare all this? Iul. Seruant I discharge you my seruice, Ile entertaine no braggarts. Ono. Signior, we discharge yoy the Court, wee'l haue no gulles in our company. Far. Abram we casheere you our company, wee must haue no minnions at Court. Emu. Oh patience bee thou my fortification: Italy thou spurnest me for vttering that nutriment, which I suckt from thee. Fa. How Italy? away you ideot: Italy infects you not, but your owne diseased spirits: Italy? out you froth, you scumme, because your soule is mud, and that you haue breathed in Italy, you'll say Italy haue defyled you: away you bore, thou wilt wallow in mire in the sweetest countrie in the world. Emu. I cannot conceipt this rawnes: Italy farewell, Italians adue. A vertuous soule abhorres to dwell with you. Exit. All. Ha ha ha: Laugh. Enter Marquesse and Sir Owen. Iu. Peace seruants, here comes the Duke my brother. Marq. Loe cousen heere they be: are yee heere Gentlemen? And Iulia you too? then Ile call your eyes, To testifie, that to Sir Meredith, I doe deliuer heere foure sealed bondes: Coze haue a care to them, it much behooues you, For Gentlemen, within this parchment lyes, Fiue thousand Duckets payable to him, Iust foureteene daies before next Penticoast, Coze it concernes you, therefore keep them safe.

You shal not take such counsaile from my lips, How now Mario? what newes brings thee hither in such quicke haste? Mari. Your wife (my gratious Lord) Is now deliuered of two beautious twins, A sonne and daughter. Marq. Take that for thy paines, Not for the ioy that I conceiue thereby, For Grissill is not gratious in the eye Of those that loue me, therefore I must hate Those that doe make my life vnfortunate. And thats my children: must I not Mario? Thou bowest thy knee, well, well I know thy minde, Uertue in villaines can no succour finde, A sonne and daughter?

Fur. No, she was fast a sleepe. Marq. Giue me this blessed burthen, pretty foole With what an amiable looke it sleepes, And in that slumber how it sweetly smiles, And in that smile how my heart leapes for ioy: Furio Ile turne this circle to a cradle, To rocke my deare babe: A great Romaine Lord, Taught his young Sonne to ride a Hodby-horse. Then why should I thinke scorne to dandle mine: Furio beholde it well, to whom ist like? Fur. You, there's your nose and blacke eye-browes. Enter Mario. Marq. Thou dost but flatter me, heere comes Mario, I know Mario will not flatter me, Mario, thy opinion, view this childe, Doth not his lips, his nose, his fore-head, And euery other part resemble mine?

Marq. Furio, play thou the nurse, handle it softly. Fur. One were better get a dossen then nurse one. Marq. Mario step to Grissill shee's a sleepe, Her white hand is the piller to those cares, Which I vngently lodg'e within her head, Steale thou the other childe and bring it hither, If Grissill be awake and striue with thee, Bring it perforce, nor let her know what hand, Hath rob'd her of this other, haste Mario. Mari. I flie my gratious Lord. Exit. Marq. Run flatterie, because I did blaspheme and cal it browne, This Parrasite cride (like an Eccho) browne. Fur. The childe is faire my Lord, you were nere so faire Marq. I know tis faire, I know tis wondrous faire, Deare prettie infant let me with a kisse, Take that dishonor off, which the foule breath Of a prophane slaue, laide vpon thy cheekes; Had but I said my boy's a Blackamoore, He would haue damn'd himselfe and so haue swore. Enter Grissill and Mario with a childe. Gris. Giue me mine infant, where's my other babe? You cannot plaie the nurse, your horred eyes Will fright my little ones, and make them crie, Your tongue's too ruffe to chime a lullabie: Tis not the pleasure of my Lord I know, To loade me with such wrong. Mari. No, I vnloade you. Scoffingly. Marq. Giue her her childe Mario and yet staie, Furio holde thou them both, Grissill forbeare, You are but nurse to them, they are not thine. Gri. I know my gratious Lord they are not mine, I am but their poore nurse I must confesse, Alas let not a nurse be pittilesse. To see the colde ayre make them looke thus bleake, Makes me shed teares because they cannot speake. Marq. If they could speake, what thinke you they would say? Gri. That I in all things will your wil obay. Marq. Obay it then in silence: shall not I Bestowe what is myne owne, as likes me best? Deliuer me these brats: come presse me downe, With weightie infamie: heere is a loade Of shame, of speckled shame: O God how heauie An armefull of dishonour is? heeres two, Grissill for this ile thanke none els but you, Which way so ere I turne I meete a face, That makes my cheekes blush at mine owne disgrace. This way or this way, neuer shall mine eye Looke thus, or thus: but (oh me) presentlie, (Take them for Gods sake Furio) presentlie I shall spend childish teares: true teares indeed, That thus I wrong my babes and make her bleede, Goe Grissill get you in. Gri. I goe my Lorde. Farewell sweet sweet deare babes, so you were free, Would all the worlds cares might be throwne on me. Mar. Ha, ha, why this is pleasing harmonie. Fu. My Lord they'le wrawle, what shall I doe with them? Marq. Tell her thou must prouide a nurse for them Comes she not backe Mario? Mari. No my Lord. Marq. Tush, tush, it cannot be but sheele returne, I know her bosome beares no marble heart, I knowe, a tender Mother cannot part, With such a patient soule, from such sweet soules, She stands and watches sure, and sure she weepes, To see my seeming flintie breast, Mario Withdraw with me: Furio stay thou heere still, If she returne, seeme childish, and denie To let her kisse or touch them. Exeunt Fur. Faith not I: I haue not such a heart, and shee aske to touch them. Ile deny it because ile obey my Lord, yet she shall kisse and touch them to, because Ile please my Ladie: alas, alas, prettie fooles I loue you well but I would you had a better Nurse. Enter Grissill stealingly Gris. A better Nurse: seek'st thou a better Nurse? A better Nurse then whome? Fu. Then you, away. Gris. I am their Mother I must not away, Looke, looke, good Furio looke they smile on mee, I know poore hearts they feare to smile on thee, I prithee let me haue them. Fu. Touch them not. Gri. I prie thee let me touch them. Fu. No: Hands off. Gri. I prie thee gentle Furio let me kisse them. Fu. Not one kisse for a Kings crowne: Gris. Must I not kisse my babes: must I not touch them? Alas what sin so vile hath Grissil done That thus she should be vex'd? not kisse my infants? Who taught thee to be cruell gentle churle, What must thou doe with them? Fu. Get them a nurse. Gris. A Nurse alacke, what Nurse? where must shee dwell Fu. I must not tell you: till I know my selfe, Gri. For Gods sake who must Nurse them doe but name her, And I will sweare those firie eyes doe smile, And I will sweare that which none els will sweare, That thy grim browes, doe mercies liuerie weare, Fu. Choose you. Enter Marquesse, standing aside. Gris. Oh God, oh God, might Grissill haue her choice My babes should not be scard with thy diuils voice. Thou get a Nurse for them? they can abide, To taste no milke but mine, come, come Ile chide, In faith you cruell man, Ile chide indeede, If I growe angrie. Fu. Do do I care not. Marq. To chide &amp; curse thy Lord thou hast more need Gris. Wilt thou not tell me who shall be their Nurse? Fu. No. Gris. Wilt thou not let me kisse them? Fu No I say. Gris. I prithee let my teares, let my bow'd knees, Bend thy obdurate hart, see heer's a fountaine, Which heauen into this Alablaster bowels, Instil'd to nourish them: man theyle crie, And blame thee that this ronnes so lauishly, Heres milke for both my babes two brests for two. Marq. Poore babes I weep to see what wrong I doe. Gris. I pray thee let them suck I am most meete, To play their Nurse: theyle smile and say tis sweet, Which streames fr? hence, if thou dost beare them h?ce, My angrie breasts will swell, and as mine eyes Lets fall salt drops, with these white Necter teares, They will be mixt: this sweet will then be brine, Theyle crie Ile chide and say the sinne is thine. Fu. Mine armes ake mightily. And my heart akes. Marq. And so doth mine: sweet sounds this discord makes. Fu. Heere Madame take one, I am weary of both, touch it and kisse it to, its a sweet childe, I would I were rid of my miserie, for I shall drowne my heart, with my teares that fall in ward. Gris. Oh this is gentlie done this is my boy, My first borne care: thy feete that neuere felt ground, Haue traueld longest in this land of woe, This worlds wildernes, and hast most neede, Of my most comfort: oh I thanke thee Furio, I know I should transforme thee with my teares, And melt thy adamantiue heart like waxe, What wrong shall these haue to be tane from mee, Mildely intreate their Nurse to touch them mildely, For my soule tels me, that my honoured Lord, Does but to trie poore Grissils constancie, Hees full of mercie iustice, full of loue. Marq. My cheekes doe glow with shame to heere her speake, Should I not weepe for ioy my heart would breake, And yet a little more Ile stretch my tryall. Enter Mario and Lepido. Mario, Lepido? Both My gracious Lord? Marq. You shall be witnesse of this open wrong. I gaue strait charge, she should not touch these brats, Yet has she tempted with lasciuious teares, The heart of Furio, see she dandles them, Take that childe from her: stay, stay, ile commend, That pittie in thee which Ile reprepend. Fu. Doe. Marq. Dare you thus contradict our strait commaund But heeres a trustie groome, out hipocrite, I shall doe Iustice wrong to let thee breath, For disobaying me. Gris. My gracious Lord, Marq. Tempt me not Syren, since you are so louing, Hold you take both your children, get you gon, Disrobe her of these rich abiliments, Take downe her hat, her pitcher and her gowne, And as she came to me in beggerie, So driue her to her fathers. Mari. My deare Lorde. Marq. Uex me not good Mario if you woe me, (Or if you shed one teare) to pittie her, Or if by any drift you succour her, You loose my fauour euerlastingly, Both. We must obey since there's no remedye, Marq. You must be villaines theres no remedie, Mario, Lepido, you two shall helpe, To beare her children home. Gri. It shall not neede I can beare more. Marq. Thou bearest too much indeed. Gri. Come, come sweet lambes wee'll laugh and liue content Though from the Court we liue in banishment, These rich attyres are for your mother fit, But not your nurse, therefore Ile off with it. Marq Away with her I say. Gris. Away, away? Nothing but that colde comfort wee'll obay, Heauen smile vpon my Lord with gratious eye, Marq. Driue her hence Lepido. Lep. Good Madame hence. Gri. Thus tyranny oppresseth innocence, Thy lookes seeme heauy, but thy heart is light, For villaines laugh when wrong oppresseth right. Run to him Must we then be driuen hence: Oh see my Lord, Sweet prettie fooles they both smil'd at that word. They smile as who should say indeede indeede, Your tongue cryes hence, but your heart's not agree'd, Can you thus part from them? in truth I know, Your true loue cannot let these infants goe. Marq. Shee'll tryumph ouer me doe what I can. Turnes from her. Mari. Good Madame hence. Gri. Oh send one gratious smile Before we leaue this place: turne not away, Doe but looke backe, let vs but once more see Those eyes, whose beames shall breath new soules in three. It is enough now weele depart in ioy, Nay be not you so cruell, should you two Be thus driuen hence, trust me Ide pitty you. Marq. Disrobe her presently. Both. It shall be done. Grissi. To worke some good deede thus you would not runne. Exeunt. Marq. Oh Grissill in large Carracters of golde, Thy vertuous sacred fame shall be enroulde, Tell me thy iudgement Furio of my wife? Fur. I thinke my Lord shee's a true woman, for shee loues her children, a rare wife, for shee loues you, (I beleeue you'll hardly finde her match) and I thinke shee's more then a woman, because shee conqueres all wrongs by patience. Mar. Yet once more will I trye her, presently Ile haue thee goe to olde Ianicolaes, And take her children from her, breed some doubt, (By speeches) in her, that her eyes shall neuer Beholde them more: beare them to Pauia, Commend vs to our brother, say from vs, That we desire him with all kinde respect, To nurse the infants, and withall conceale, Their parentage from any mortall eare, I charge thee on thy life reueale not this, I charge thee on thy life, be like thy name, (When thou comst to her) rough and furious. Fur. Well, I will: It's far from Saluce to Pauia, the children will cry, I haue no teates you know, twere good you thought vpon it. Marq. There's golde. Fu. That's good. Marq. Prouide them nurses. Fu. That's better, I will and I can. Exit Furio. Marq. Away, though I dare trust thy secrecy, Yet will I follow thee in some disguise, And try thy faith, and Grissils constancy: If thou abide vnblemisht, then I sweare, A haue found two wonders that are sildome rife, A trusty seruant, and a patient wife. Exit. Enter Ianicola and Laureo, with burdens of Osiers. Lau. Father how fare you? Ian. Uery well my sonne, This labour is a comfort to my age, The Marquesse hath to me been mercifull, In sending me from Courtly delicates, To taste the quiet of this country life. Lau. Call him not mercifull, his tyranny Exceedes the most inhumaine. Ian. Peace my sonne, I thought by learning thou hadst been made wise, But I perceiue it puffeth vp thy soule, Thou takst a pleasure to be counted iust, And kicke against the faults of mighty men: Oh tis in vaine, the earth may euen as well Challenge the potter to be partiall, For forming it to sundry offices: Alas the errour of ambitious fooles, How fraile are all their thoughts, how faint, how weake? Those that doe striue to iustle with the great, Are certaine to be bruz'd, or soone to breake. Come, come mell with our Osiers, heere let's rest, This is olde homely home, &amp; that's still best. Enter Babulo with a bundle of Osiers in one arme and a childe in another, Grissill after him with another childe. Bab. Hush, hush, hush, hush, and I daunce mine own childe, and I dance mine owne childe, &amp;c: ha ha, whoop olde Master, so ho ho, looke heere, and I dance mine own childe, &amp;c: heere's sixteene pence a weeke, and sixteene pence a weeke, eight groates, sope and candle, I met her in Osier groue, crying hush, hush, hush, hush: I thought it had been some begger woman, because of her pitcher, for you know they beare such houshold stuffe, to put drinke and porrage together, and I dance mine, &amp;c. Lau. Oh father now forsweare all patience, Grissill comes home to you in poore array, Grissill is made a drudge, a cast-away. Ian. Grissill is welcome home to pouerty, How now my childe are these thy pretty babes? Ba. And I dance myne owne childe: art thou there? art thou there? Ian. Why art thou thus come home, who sent thee hyther? Gri. It is the pleasure of my princely Lord, Who taking some offence, to me vnknowne, Hath banisht me from care to quietnes. Ba. A fig for care, olde Master, but now olde graundsire, take this little Pope Innocent, wee'll giue ouer basket making and turne nurses, shee has vnckled Laureo: Its no matter, you shall goe make a fire, Grandsire you shall dandle them, Grissill shall goe make Pap, and Ile licke the skillet, but first Ile fetch a cradle, its a signe tis not a deare yeare, when they come by two at once, heer's a couple quoth Iacke dawe, art thou there? sing Grandsire. Exit. Ian. What said the Marquesse when he banisht thee? Gri. He gaue me gentle language, kist my cheeke, For Gods sake therfore speake not ill of him, Teares trickling from his eyes, and sorrowes hand Stopping his mouth, thus did he bid adue, Whilst many a deep fetcht sigh from his brest flew. Therefore for Gods sake speake not ill of him. Good Lord how many a kisse he gaue my babes, And with wet eyes bad me be patient, And by my truth (if I haue any truth) I came from Court more quiet and content, By many a thousand part then when I went: Therefore for Gods loue speake not ill of him. Lau. O vile deiection of too base a soule, Hast thou beheld the Paradice of Court, Fed of rich seuerall meates, bath'd in sweet streames, Slept on the bed of pleasure, sate inthroned, Whilst troopes of Saint-like haue adored thee: And being now throwne downe by violence, Dost thou not enuy those that driue thee thence? Gri. Far be it from my heart from enuying my Lord In thought, much lesse eyther in deed or word. Lau. Then hast thou no true soule, for I would curse From the Sunnes arising to his westerne fall, The Marquesse and his flattering minions. Gri. By day and night, kinde heauen protect them all, What wrong haue they done me? what hate to you? Haue I not fed vpon the Princes cost? Been cloath'd in rich attyres, liu'd on his charge? Looke heere my russet gowne is yet vnworne, And many a winter more may serue my turne, By the preseruing it so many monthes: My Pitcher is vnhurt, see it is fill'd With christall water of the crisped spring. If you remember on my wedding day, You sent me with this pitcher to the well, And I came empty home, because I met The gratious Marquesse and his company. Now hath he sent you this cup full of teares, You'll say the comfort's colde, well be it so, Yet euery little comfort helpes in woe. Ian. True modle of true vertue, welcome childe, Thou and these tender babes to me are welcome. Wee'll worke to finde them foode, come kisse them soone, And let's forget these wrongs as neuer done. Enter Babulo with a cradle. Ba. Come, where be these infidels? heere's the cradle of security, and my pillow of idlenes for them, and their Grandsires cleake (not of hypocrisie) but honesty to couer them. Ian. Lay them both softly downe, Grissill sit downe, Laureo fetch you my lute, rocke thou the cradle. Couer the poore fooles arme, ile charme their eyes, To take a sleepe by sweet tunde lullabyes. The Song. Golden slumbers kisse your eyes, Smiles awake you when you rise: Sleepe pretty wantons doe not cry, And I will sing a lullabie, Rocke them rocke them lullabie. Care is heauy therefore sleepe you, You are care and care must keep you: Sleepe pretty wantons doe not cry, And I will sing a lullabie, Rocke them rocke them lullabie. Enter Furio and Marquesse aloofe disguised with baskets. Fur. Leaue singing. Ba. We may choose, Grandsire sol fa once more, we'll alla mire him, and he we waile in woe, and who can hinder vs? Fur. Sirra Scholler read there, it's a commission for mee to take away these children. Ba. Nay then y'are welcome, there's foure groates, and heere's foure more. Gri. To take away my children gentle Furio, Why must my babes beare this vngentle doome? Fur. Goe looke. Lau. O misery, O most accursed time, When to be foes to guilt is helde a crime, Sister this fiend must beare your infants hence. Ia. Good Grissil beare al wrongs wt patience. Weepes Gri. Good father let true patience cure all woe, You bid me be content, oh be you so. Lau. Father why doe you weepe? Ian. What can I doe, Though her he punish, he might pitty you. Lau. Let's fret and curse the Marquesse cruelly. Ba. I by my troth that's a good way, we may well do it, now we are out of his hearing. Gri. Must I then be diuorc'd? and loose this treasure, I must and am content, since tis his pleasure, I prie thee tell we whither they must goe? Fu. No. Gri. Art thou commaunded to conceale the place? Fur. I. Gri. Then will not I inquire, thou dost but iest I know thou must not rob me, tis to try If I loue them: no, no, heere I read, That which strikes blinde mine eyes, makes my heart bleede, Farewell, farewell, deare soules, adue adue, Your father sendes and I must part from you, I must oh God I must, must is for Kings, And loe obedience, for loe vnderlings. Lau. He shall not hale them thus, keep them perforce, This slaue lookes on them with a murdring eye. Ba. No, he shal not haue them, knocke out his braines, and saue the little hop a my thombes. Fa. Doe if you dare. Marq. How now my hearts, what's the matter? Fu. What car'st thou. Lau. This is poore Grissil, wife vnto our Duke, And these her children, thus he sendes her home, And thus he sends a serpent to deuour, Their pretious liues, he brings commission, To hale them hence, but whyther none can tell. Gris. Forbeare, forbeare. Marq. Take them from him perforce, Are these his children? Ba. So she saies. Marq. Two sweet Duckes, and is this his wife? Ba. Yes, he has lyne with her. Mar. A pretty soule, sirra thou wilt be hang'd for this. Fu. Hang thy selfe. Mar. Beate him, but first take these two from his armes, I am a basket maker, and I sweare Ile dye before he beare away the babes, Ba. Oh rare, cry prentises and clubs, the corporation cannot be ( ) sirra set downe thy baskets and to't pell mell. Fu. Would I were rid of my office? Gri. What will you doe, driue this rashe fellowe hence? Marq. The Marquesse is a tyrant and does worng. Gri. I would not for the world that hee should heare thee. Mar. I would not for ten worlds but heare my Grissil. Gri. A tyrant, no he's mercy euen her selfe, Iustice in triumph rides in his two eyes, Take heede how thou prophanest high deityes: Goe Furio, get thee gone: good father helpe me To guard my deare Lords seruant from this place, I know hee'll doe my pretty babes no harme, For see Furio lookes gently: oh get thee gone, Pitty sits on thy cheekes, but God can tell, My heart saies my tongue lyes, farewell farewell. Marq. Stay sirra take thy purse. Fur. I let none fall. Ba. Halfe part. Ia. A purse of golde Furio is falne from thee. Fu. Its none of mine, sirra basket-maker, if my armes were not full, thou should haue thy handes full: farewel Grissill, if thou neuer see thy children more, curse mee, if thou dost see them againe, thanke God, adue. Exit. Ba. Farewell and be hang'd. Gri. I will thanke God for all, why should I grieue, To loose my children? no no, I ought rather Reioyce, because they are borne to their Father. Ia. Daughter, heere's nothing in this purse but golde. Ba. So much the better, Master we'll quickely turne it into siluer. Ia. This purse that fellow did let fall, run run, Carry it him againe, run Babulo, Away with it, tis laide to doe vs wrong. Lau. Try all their golden baites, stay neuer run, They can doe no more wrong then they haue done. Ia. What ayles my Grissill? comfort my childe. Ba. Ile fetch Rosa solis. Marq. Poore soule her griefe burnes inward, yet her tung Is loath to giue it freedome: I doe wrong, Oh Grissill I doe wrong thee and, lament, That for my sake thou feel'st this languishment. I came to try a seruant and a wife, Both haue I prooued true, that purse of golde I brought, And let it fall of purpose to relieue her, Well may I giue her golde that so much grieue her, As I came in by stealth, so Ile away, Ioy has a tongue, but knowes not what to say. Exit. Gri. So father I am well, I am well indeed, I should doe wondrous ill, should I repine, At my babes losse for they are none of mine. Ia. I am glad thou tak'st this wound so patiently. Ba. Whoope whether is my brother basket-maker gone: ha let me see, I smell a rat, sneakt hence and neuer take leaue, eyther hee's a craftie knaue, or else hee dogs Furio to byte him, for when a quarrell enters into a trade it serues seauen yeares before it be free. Ia. Let him be whome he will, he seem'd our friend, Grissill lay vp this golde tis Furioes sure, Or it may be thy Lord did giue it him, To let it fall for thee, but keep it safe, If he disdaine to loue thee as a wife, His golde shall not buy foode to nourish thee, Grissill come in, time swiftly runs away, The greatest sorrow hath an ending day. Exeunt. Enter Gwenthyan and Rice, she meanely, he like a Cooke. Gwen. Rees, lay her table, and set out her fittailes, and preades, and wines, and ale, and peare, and salt for her guesse. Ri.

Ono. Condemne vs not till you trye our loues. Iul. Sweet seruant speake not in this language of loue, Gwenthyans peeuishnes and Grissils patience, make me heere to defie that Ape Cupid, if you loue stand vpon his lawes, I charge you leaue it, I charge you neither to sigh for loue, nor speake of loue, nor frowne for hate: if you sigh ile mocke you, if you speake ile stop mine eares, if you frowne ile bend my fist. Far. Then youle turne warriour in deede. Iul. Had I not neede encountring with such enemies? but say will you obay and followe mee or disobay, and Ile flie you. Ono. I obay since it is your pleasure. Vrc. I obay though I taste no pleasure in it. Farn.

Marq. Iulia and Gentlemen these are the newes, Brought on the wings of hast and happines, By trustie Lepido our endeared brother, Is hard at hand who in his companie, Brings my faire second choice a worthie bride, Attended by the States of Pauia, Shees daughter to the Duke of Brandenburgh, Now shall no subiects enuious soule repine, And call her base whome now I will make mine, None shall vpbraid me now, (as they haue done) That I will slay a daughter and a Sonne, Grissils, two babes are dead, and kild by scorne, But that faire issue that shall now be borne Shall make a satisfaction of all wrongs. Come gentlemen we will goe meete this traine, Let euerie one put on a smiling browe, Sir Owen I will haue your company, And your's faire cozen: well remembred to, Bring your three wands Sir Owen to the Court, Though Gwenthyan looke with a smoother eye, Ile teach you how to win the soueraigntie.

Lau. A Scholler doth disdaine to spend his spirits, Upon such base imploiments as hand labours. Ba. Then you should disdaine to eate vs out of house &amp; home: you stand all day peeping into an ambrie there, and talke of monsters and miracles, and countries to no purpose: before I fell to my trade I was a traueller, and found more in one yeare then you can by your poets and paltries in seauen yeares. Lau. What wonders hast thou seene, which are not heere? Ba. Oh God, I pittie thy capacitye good scholler: as a little wind makes a sweet ball smell, so a crumme of learning makes your trade proude: what wonders? wonders not of nine daies, but 1599. I haue seene vnder Iohn Prester and Tamer Cams people, with heds like Dogs. Lau. Alas of such there are too manie heere, All Italie is full of them that snarle, And bay and barke at other mens abuse Yet liue themselues like beastes in all abuse. Bab. Its true I know manie of that complexion, but I haue seene many without heads, hauing their eyes nose and mouths in their breasts. Lau. Whie thats no wonder, euerie streete with vs, Swarmes full of such, Ba. I could neuer see them. Lau. Dost thou not see our wine-bellie drunkards reele? Our fat fed gluttons wallow in the streetes, Hauing no eyes but to behold their guts, No heads but braineles scalpes, no sence to smell, But where full feastes abound in all excesse These EpimÅi be our Epicures. Ba. I haue seene monsters of that colour to: but what say you to them that haue but one leg, and yet will out run a horse? Lau. Such are our banckrouts and our fugitiues, Scarse hauing one good leg, or one good limbe, Out run their creditors, and those they wrong. Ba. Mas tis true there was a cripple in our village, ran beyond Venice, and his Creditors with their best legs could neuer since take him, but let me descend &amp; grow lower and lower, what say you to the litle litle Pigmies, no higher then a boyes gig, and yet they tug &amp; fight with the long neckt Cranes. Lau. Oh poore and wretched people are the Pigmies, Oh rich oppressors the deuouring Cranes, Within my fathers house Ile shew thee Pigmies, Thou seest my sister Grissill shee's a Pigmie. Ba. Shee's a pretty little woman indeed, but too big for a Pigmie. Lau. I am a Pigmie. Ba. Fye fye, worse and worse. Lau. My olde father's one. Ba. No no no, Giants all. Lau.

Must we againe be harried from content? To liue in a more grieuous banishment. Lau. Me thinkes my Lord the Marquesse should bee pleas'd With mariage of another, and forbeare, With trumpets to proclaime this iniurie, And to vexe Grissill with such lawlesse wrong. Gri. Tis no vexation, for what pleaseth him, Is the contentment of his hand-maides heart. Fur. Will you goe? Ian. Yes we will goe, To flye from happines to finde out woe. Ba. Good Furio vanish, we haue no appetite, tell your Master, Clownes are not for the Court, wee'll keepe Court our selues, for what doe Courtiers but wee doe the like: you eate good cheere, and wee eate good bread and cheese: you drinke wine, and we strong beare: at night you are as hungry slaues as you were at noone, why so are wee: you goe to bed, you can but sleepe, why and so doe wee: in the morning you rise about eleuen of the clocke, why there we are your betters, for wee are going before you: you weare silkes, and wee sheepe-skinnes, innocence caries it away in the world to come, and therefore vanish good Furio, torment vs not good my sweet Furio. Fur. Asse Ile haue you snaffled, Ba. It may be so, but then Furio Ile kicke. Fu. Will you goe, or shall I force you? Gri. You neede not, for Ile run to serue my Lord, Or if I wanted legs, vpon my knees Ile creepe to Court so I may see him pleas'd, Then courage Father. Ian. Well said patience, Thy vertues arme mine age with confidence, Come son, bond-men must serue, shall we away? Lau. I, I, but this shall prooue a fatall day. Gri. Brother, for my sake doe not wrong your selfe. Lau. Shall I in silence bury all our wrongs? Gri. Yes when your words cannot get remedy, Learne of me Laureo I that share most woe, Am the least moou'd, father leane on mine arme, Brother leade you the way, whilst wretched I Upholde olde age, and cast downe miserie.

Blessing distill on you like morning deaw, My soule knit to your soules, knowes you are mine. Ma. They are, &amp; I am thine: Lords looke not strange, These two are they, at whose birthes enuies tongue, Darted enuenom'd stings, these are the fruite Of this most vertuous tree, that multitude, That many headed beastes, nipt their sweet hearts, With wrongs, with bitter wrongs, al you haue wrong'd her, My selfe haue done most wrong, for I did try To breake the temper of true constancie: But these whom all thought murdred are aliue, My Grissill liues, and in the booke of Fame, All worldes in golde shall register her name. Le., Mar. Most dreaded Lord. Marq. Arise flatterers get you gone, Exeunt Lep. Ma. Your soules are made of blacke confusion. Father Ianicola. Ia. Oh pardon me, Though dumbe betwixt my griefe and ioy I be. Marq. Who stands thus sad, what brother Laureo? Eau. Pardon me my gratious Lord, for now I see, That Schollers with weake eyes, pore on their bookes, But want true soules to iudge on Maiestie: None else but Kings can know the hearts of Kings, Hence foorth my pride shall fly with humbler wings. Marq. Our pardon and our loue circle thee round, Lets all to banquet, mirth our cares confound. Ow. Holde, holde, holde, banquet? if you banquet so, Sir Owen is like to haue sheere, her Latie heere is cog a hoope now at this, pray Cozen keepe your promise, Rees the wandes Rees, your medicines and fine trigs to tame shrewes.

Mar. And I wil keep my promise, wreath your wands Owen. Owe Gods lid mine is stubberne like Gwenthians, Gods plude see it preakes in snip snap peeces, what now Cozen? Marq. But cozen these you see did gently bowe, I tride my Grissils patience when twas greene, Like a young Orier, and I moulded it Like waxe to all impressions: married men That long to tame their wiues must curbe them in, Before they need a bridle, then they'll prooue All Grissils full of patience, full of loue, Yet that olde tryall must be tempered so, Least seeking to tame them they master you. Owen. By Cod is true as Pistle and Gospel, oh true out a cry. Marq. But you Sir Owen giuing her the head, As you gaue liberty to those three wandes, Shee'll breake as those doe, if you bend her now, And then y'are past all helpe, for if you striue, You'll gaine as gamesters doe that sildome thriue. owe. What shall doe to her Latie then? is pest run away cozen, or knog her braines out? for is as faliant as Mars if I be anger. Iul. That were a shame eyther to run away from a woman, or to strike her, your best Phisicke Sir Owen, is to weare a veluet hand, leaden eares, and no tongue, you must not fight howsoeuer she quarrels, you must be deafe whensoeuer she brawles, and dumbe when your selfe should brabble: take this cawdle next your heart euery morning, and if your wife be not patient, the next remedy that I know is, to buy your winding sheete. Gwe. Cozen Marquesse, cozen Iulia, and Lawrds and Laties all, it shall not need as her cozen has tryed Grissill, so Gwenthian has Sir Owen, Ow. Owe, by Cod is thought should pull her downe, ah ha. Gwe.

Ow. By Cod is loue her out a cry now, sir owen could tame her before, but Prittish ploude scawrnes to fide wt Laties, yes faith scornes out a cry, a pogs ont tis nought: Gwenthian shall no more be call'd Gwenthian but patient Grissill, ah ha is. Marq. Our ioyes are compleate, forward to our feast, Patience hath won the prize and now is blest. Iu. Nay brother your pardon awhile: besides our selues there are a number heere, that haue behelde Grissils patience, you owne tryals, and Sir Owens sufferance, Gwenthians frowardnes, these Gentlemen louertine, and my selfe a hater of loue: amongst this company I trust there are some mayden batchelers, and virgin maydens, those that liue in that freedome &amp; loue it, those that know the war of mariage and hate it, set their hands to my bill, which is rather to dye a mayde and leade Apes in hell, then to liue a wife and be continually in hell. Gwen.
