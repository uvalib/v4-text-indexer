      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Acropolis of Corinth. Creon reclining on a bench, beneath open columns.â Iphitus a little behind him, in the dress of Augury, watching the flight of birds. The Sea seen far below, in the distance. IPHITUS. Wheel through the ambient air, ye sacred birds, In circles still contracting, that aspire To share the radiance of yon dazzling beams, And 'midst them float from mortal gaze; ye speak In no uncertain language to the sons Of Corinth, that the shames they bear from Athens Shall speedily be lost in glories won From insolent battalions, that have borne Their triumphs to our gates. Rejoice, my king! Leave mournful contemplation of the dust, To hail the omen! CREON. I am so perplex'd With the faint tracings age's weakness shapes, That I distinguish not the winged forms Thou speakest of, from the mists that flicker quick On eyes which soon must be all dark. To me No omen can be otherwise than sad! IPHITUS. Surely, my kingâfor I will answer thee Untrembling, as Jove's ministerâthese signs Should make thy heart beat proudly; hast not felt Upon our loftiest eminence, the blight Of that dishonour which alone can slay The spirit of a people;âseen our fanes Crowded with suppliants from our wasted fields, Shrieking for help in vain, and mourn'd the power Of Athens to convert our cloudless sky, And the bright sea which circles us, to bounds Of a great prison? If thy kingly soul Hath shrunkâas well I know it hathâfrom shame Without example in our story, now Bid it expand, as our beleaguer'd gates Shall open wide to let our heroes pass, With brows which glisten to receive the laurel From their king's hand. CREON. Perchance to see him die. O, Iphitus! thy king hath well nigh spent His store of wealth, of glory, and of power, Which made him master of the hopes and strengths Of others! While the haggard Fury waits To cut the knot which binds his thousand threads Of lustrous life, and the sad ghost forsakes The palace of its regal clay, to shrink, Thin as a beggar's, sceptreless, uncrown'd, Unheeded, to the throng'd and silent shore Where flattery soothes not, think'st thou it can draw A parting comfort from surrounding looks Of lusty youth, prepar'd, with beaming joy, To hail a young successor? IPHITUS. Still thine age Is green and hopeful; there is nought about thee To speak of mortal sickness, and unnerve A soul that once was noble. CREON. Priest, forbear! The life that lingers in me is the witness With which I may not palter. I may seem To-day to wear the look of yesterday,â A shrivell'd, doting, peevish, weak old man, Who may endure some winters more to strip A leaflet daily from him, till he stands So bare of happiness, that Death hath scarce An art to make him nakeder. My soul Begins its solemn whispers of adieu To earth's too sweet companionship. Yet, hark! It is Creusa's footstep; is't not, priest? Is not my child approaching us? IPHITUS. Afar I see the snowy foldings of a robe Wave through the column'd avenue; thy sense Is finer than the impatient ear of youth, That it should catch the music of a step So distant and so gentle. CREON. If thou wert A father, thou wouldst know a father's love 'Mid nature's weakness, for one failing sense Still finds another sharpen'd to attend Its finest ministries. Unlike the pomps That make the dregs of life more bitter, this Can sweeten even a king's. [Creusa passes across the stage behind Creon, bearing offerings.] She passes on; So! So! all leave me. Call her, Iphitus, Though that her duty own no touch of fondness, I will command her. Am I not her king? Why dost not call? Re-enter Creusa, who kneels in front to Creon. Ah! thou art there, my child; Methinks my waning sight grows clear, to drink The perfect picture of thy beauty in; And I grow gentleâAh! too gentle, girlâ Wherefore didst pass me by without regard, Who have scant blessing left save thus to gaze And listen to thee? CREUSA. Pardon me, my father, If, bearing offerings to the shrine of Jove For my sweet brother's safety, anxious thoughts Clove to him in the battle with a force Which made its strangest shapes of horror live As present things; and, lost in their pursuit, I heeded not my father. CREON. In the battle? Is Hyllus in the combat 'mid those ranks Of iron? He who hath not rounded yet His course of generous exercise? I'm weak; Is that the cause? Is he impatient grown To put the royal armour on, his sire Must never wear again? Oh, no! his youth, In its obedient gentleness, hath been An infancy prolong'd! It is the Power Which strikes me with the portents of the grave, That by the sight of his ensanguined corpse Would hasten their fulfilment; 'tis well aim'd, I shall fall cold before it. CREUSA. 'Twas a word, Dropp'd by the queen in answer to some speech In which she fancied slight to Athens, rous'd His spirit to an ecstasy; he spurn'd The light accoutrements of mimic war; Borrow'd a soldier's sword, and, with the troops Who sallied forth at day-break, sought the fieldâ Where Jupiter protect him! CREON. Bid the queen Here answer to us. [Exit Iphitus. Rarely will she speak, And calmly, yet her sad and solemn words Have power to thrill and madden. O my girl, Had not my wayward fancy been enthrall'd By that Athenian loveliness which shone From basest vestments, in a form whose grace Made the cold beauty of Olympus earth's, And drew me to be traitor to the urn Which holds thy mother's ashes, I had spent My age in sweet renewal of my youth With thought of her who gladden'd it, nor known The vain endeavour to enforce regard From one whose heart is dead amidst the living. Re-enter Iphitus. CREON. Comes the queen hither? Does she mock our bidding? IPHITUS. At stern Minerva's inmost shrine she kneels, And with an arm as rigid and as pale As is the giant statue, clasps the foot That seems as it would spurn her, yet were stay'd By the firm suppliant's will. She looks attent As one who caught some hint of distant sounds, Yet none from living intercourse of man Can pierce that marble solitude. Her face Uprais'd, is motionless,âyet while I mark'd itâ As from its fathomless abode a spring Breaks on the bosom of a sullen lake And in an instant grows as still,âa hue Of blackness trembled o'er it; her large eye Kindled with frightful lustre;âbut the shade Pass'd instant thence; her face resum'd its look Of stone, as death-like as the aspect pure Of the great face divine to which it answered. I durst not speak to her. CREON. I see it plain; Her thoughts are with our foes, the blood of Athens Mantles or freezes in her alien veins; Let her alone. [Shouts without. CREUSA. Hark!âThey would never shout If Hyllus were in peril. CREON. Were he slain In dashing back the dusky wall of shields, Beneath which Athens masks her pride of war, They would exult and mock the slaughter'd boy With PÃ¦ans. CREUSA. So my brother would have chosen! [Shouts renewed. Enter Corinthian Soldier. SOLDIER. Our foes are driven to their tents, the field Is oursâ CREON. [Hastily interrupting him. What of the princeâmy son? Thou dost avoid his name;âhave ye achiev'd This noisy triumph with his blood? SOLDIER. A wound, Slight, as we hope, hath grac'd his early valour, And though it draws some colour from his cheek Leaves the heart fearless. CREON. I will well avenge The faintest breath of sorrow which hath dimm'd The mirror of his youth. Will he not come? Why does he linger, if his wound is slight, From the fond arms of him who will avenge it? SOLDIER. He comes, my lord. CREON. Make way, there! Let me clasp him! Enter Hyllus, pale, as slightly wounded. Why does he not embrace me? [Creusa runs to Hyllus, and supports him as he moves towards Creon. CREUSA. He is faint, Exhausted, breathless,âbleeding. Lean on me, [To Hyllus. And let me lead thee to the king, who pants To bid his youngest soldier welcome. HYLLUS. Nay 'Tis nothing. Silly trembler!âSee, my limbs Are pliant and my sinews docile still. [Kneels to Creon. Kneel with me; pray our father to forgive The disobedience of his truant son, His firstâoh, may it prove the last! [Creusa kneels with Hyllus to Creon. CREON. My son! Who fancied I was angry? Enter Ismene. (To Ismene.) Art thou come, To gaze upon the perill'd youth who owes His wound to thee? ISMENE. He utter'd shallow scorn Of Athens;âwhich he ne'er will speak again. CREON. Wouldst dare to curb his speech? HYLLUS. Forbear, my father; The queen says rightly. In that idle mood, Which youth's excess of happiness makes wanton, I slighted our illustrious foes, whose arms Have, with this mild correction, taught my tongue An apter phrase of modesty, and shewn What generous courage is, which till this day I dimly guess'd at. CREON. Canst thou tell his name, Who impious drew the blood of him who soonâ Too soon, alas!âshall reign in Corinth? HYLLUS. One I'm proud to claim my master in great war; With whom contesting, I have tasted first The joy which animates the glorious game Where fiercest opposition of brave hearts Makes them to feel their kindred;âone who spar'd me To grace another fight,âthe sudden smart His sword inflicted, made me vainly rush To grapple with him; from his fearful grasp I sank to earth; as I lay prone in dust, The broad steel shiv'ring in my eyes, that strove To keep their steady gaze, I met his glance, Where pity triumph'd; quickly he return'd His falchion to its sheath, and with a hand Frank and sustaining as a brother's palm, Uprais'd me;âwhile he whisper'd in mine ear, âThou hast dar'd well, young soldier,â our hot troops Environ'd him, and bore him from the plain Our army's noblest captive. CREON. He shall die; The gen'rous falsehood of thy speech is vain. CREUSA. O no! my brother's words were never false; The heroic picture proves his truth;âthey bring A gallant prisoner towards us. Sure, 'tis he. Enter Thoas, in armour, guarded by Corinthian Soldiers, and Lycus, Master of the Slaves. SOLDIER. My lord, we bring the captive, whom we found In combat with the prince. HYLLUS. Say rather, found Raising that prince whose rashness he chastis'd, And taught how he should treat a noble foe. CREON. [To the Soldiers. Answer to me! Why have ye brought this man, Whom the just gods have yielded to atone For princely blood he shed, in pride of arms? Remove that helmet. THOAS. He who stirs to touch My arms, shall feel a dying warrior's grasp. I will not doff my helmet till I yield My neck to your slave's butchery; how soon That stroke may fall, I care not. CREUSA. [To Hyllus. Hyllus, speak! Why thus transfix'd? Wilt thou not speak for him Who spar'd a life, which, light perchance to thee, Is the most precious thing to me on earth? THOAS. [To Creusa. Ere I descend to that eternal gloom Which opens to enfold me, let me bless The vision that hath cross'd it! HYLLUS. [To Creon. If thou slay him, I will implore the mercy of the sword To end me too; and, that sad grace withheld, Will kneel beside his corpse till nature give Her own dismissal to me. ISMENE. [Speaking slowly to Creon. Let him breathe A slave's ignoble life out here; 'twill prove The sterner fortune. CREON. Hearken to me, prisoner! My boy hath won this choiceâimmediate death, Or life-long portion with my slaves. THOAS. Dost dare Insult a son of Athens by the doubt Thy words imply? Wert thou in manhood's prime, Amidst thy trembling slaves would I avenge The foul suggestion, with the desperate strength Of fated valour; but thou art in years, And I should blush to harm thee;âlet me die. CREUSA. O do not fling away thy noble life, For it is rich in treasures of its own, Which Fortune cannot touch, and vision'd glories Shall stream around its bondage. THOAS. I have dream'd Indeed of greatness, lovely one, and felt The very dream worth living for, while hope, To make it real, surviv'd; and I have lov'd To image thought, the mirror of great deeds, Fed by the past to might which should impel And vivify the future;âblending thus The aims and triumphs of a hero's life. But to cheat hopeless infamy with shows Of nobleness, and filch a feeble joy In the vain spasms of the slavish soul, Were foulest treachery to the god within me. No, lady; from the fissure of a rock, Scath'd and alone, my brief existence gush'd, A passion'd torrent;âlet it not be lost In miry sands, but having caught one gleam Of loveliness to grace it, dash from earth To darkness and to silence. Lead me forthâ (To Creusa.) The Gods requite thee! CREON. Hath the captive chosen? I will not grant another moment;âspeak! Wilt serve or perish? HYLLUS. [Throwing himself before Thoas. Do not answer yet! Grant him a few short minutes to decide, And let me spend them with him. CREON. [Rising. Be it so, then! Kneel, prisoner, to the prince who won thee grace No other mortal could have gain'd:âremember The master of my slaves attends the word Thou presently shalt utter; tame thy pride To own his government, or he must bind, And slay thee. Daughter, come! The queen attends us. [Exeunt Creon and Soldiers. CREUSA. [To Hyllus, as she passes him. Thou wilt not leave him till he softens. [Ismene follows; as she passes Thoas, she speaks in a low and solemn tone. ISMENE. Live! THOAS. Who gave that shameful counsel? ISMENE. [Passing on. One of Athens. [Exit. [Exeunt all but Lycus, the Master of the Slaves,â Thoas and Hyllus. THOAS. [Abstractedly. What words are these, which bid my wayward blood, That centred at my heart with icy firmness, Come tingling back through all my veins? I seem Once more to drink Athenian ether in, And the fair city's column'd glories flash Upon my soul! LYCUS. My lord, I dare not wait. HYLLUS. [Eagerly to Lycus. He yields;âI read it in his softening gaze; It speaks of life. THOAS. Yes; I will owe life to thee. HYLLUS. Thou hear'st him, Lycus. Let me know the name Of him whom I could deem my friend. THOAS. My name! I have none worthy of thy ear; I thought To arm a common sound with deathless power; 'Tis past; thou only mark'st me from the crowd Of crawling earth-worms;âthou may'st call me, Thoas. LYCUS. [Coming forward. My prince, forgive me; I must take his armour, And lead him hence. THOAS. Great Jupiter, look down! HYLLUS. Thoas, thy faith is pledged. [to Lycus.] Stand back awhile, If thou hast nature. Thoas will to me Resign his arms. THOAS. [Taking off his helmet. To a most noble hand I yield the glories of existence up, And bid them long adieu! This plume, which now Hangs motionless, as if it felt the shame Its owner bears, wav'd in my boyish thoughts Ere I was free to wear it, as the sign, The dancing image of my bounding hopes, That imag'd it above a throng of battles, Waving where blows were fiercest. Take it henceâ Companion of brave fancies, vanish'd now For ever, follow them! [Hyllus takes the helmet from Thoas, and passes it to Lycus. HYLLUS. 'Tis nobly done; No doubt that it again shall clasp thy brow, And the plume wave in victory. Thy sword? Forgive me; I must filch it for awhile: Hide itâO deem it soâin idle sport, And keep thy chidings, till I give it back Again to smite and spare. THOAS. Too generous youth, Permit my depth of sorrow to be calm, Unruffled by vain hope. [Takes off his sword. Farewell, old sword, Thou wert the bright inheritance which grac'd My finish'd years of boyhoodâall that time And fortune spar'd of those from whom I drew The thirst of greatness. In how proud an hour Did I first clasp thee with untrembling hand, Fit thee, with fond exactness, to my side, And in the quaint adornments of thy sheath Guess deeds of valour, acted in old time By some forgotten chief, whose generous blood I felt within my swelling veins! Farewell! [Thoas gives his sword to Hyllus, who delivers it to Lycus. HYLLUS. [Diffidently. Thy buckler? THOAS. [Takes off his buckler eagerly, and delivers it to Hyllus. I rejoice to part with that; My bosom needs no bulwark save its own, For I am only man now. If my heart Should in its throbbing burst, 'twill beat against An unapparell'd casing, and be still. [Going. HYLLUS. [Hesitatingly. Hold!âone thing moreâthy girdle holds a knife; I grieve that I must ask it. THOAS. By the sense Which 'mid delights I feel thou hast not lost, Of what, in dread extremity, the brave, Stripp'd of all other refuge, would embrace,â I do adjure thee,ârob me not of this! HYLLUS. Conceal it in thy vest. [Thoas hastily places his dagger in his bosom, and takes the hand of Hyllus. THOAS. We understand Each other's spirit;âthou hast call'd me friend, And though in bonds, I answer to the name, And give it thee again. LYCUS (advancing). The time is spent Beyond the king's allowance: I must lead The captive to the court, where he may meet His fellows, find his station, and put on The habit he must wear. THOAS. Do I hear rightly? Must an Athenian warrior's free-born limbs Be clad in withering symbols of the power By which man marks his property in flesh, Bones, sinews, feelings, lying Nature framed For human? They shall rend me piecemeal first! HYLLUS. Thoasâfriendâcomrade,ârecollect thy word, Which now to break were worse disgrace than power Can fix upon thee, bids thee bear awhile This idle shame. I shall be proud to walk A listener at thy side, while generous thoughts And arts of valour, which may make them deeds, Enrich my youth. Soon shall we 'scape the court, Ply the small bark upon the summer sea, Gay careless voyagers, who leave the shore With all its vain distinctions, for a world Of dancing foam and light; till eve invites To some tall cavern, where the sea-nymphs raise Sweet melodies; there shalt thou play the prince, And I will put thy slavish vestments on, And yield thee duteous service;âin our sport Almost as potent as light Fortune is, Who in her wildest freaks but shifts the robe Of circumstance, and leaves the hearts it cloath'd Unchanged and free as ours. THOAS. I cannot speak. Comeâor mine eyes will witness me a slave To my own frailty's masterdom.âCome on! [To Lycus. Thou hast done thy office gently. Lead the way. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Court in the Palace of Creon. Enter Creon and Lycus. CREON. How does the proud Athenian bear his part In servile duty? LYCUS. I have never seen So brave a patience. The severest toils Look graceful in him, from the facile skill With which his strength subdues them. Few his words By question drawn, yet gentle as a child's; And if, in pauses of his work, his eye Will glisten, and his bosom heave; anon He starts as from a dream, submissive bows, And plies his work again. CREON. Thou dost espouse His cause. Beware! he hurl'd defiance on me, Disdain'd my age, as if his pride of strength Made him in bondage greater than a king Sick and infirm as I am; he shall feel What yet an old man can inflict. He comes; Why does he leave his duty? LYCUS. 'Tis the hour Of restâof food, if he would take it; here He's privileged to walk. CREON. Let's stand aside. [Creon and Lycus retire from sight. Enter Thoas, in the dress of a Slave. THOAS. Had I been born to greatness, or achieved My fame, methinks that I could smile at this; Taste a remember'd sweetness in the thought Of pleasure snatch'd from fate; or feed my soul With the high prospect of serene renown Beetling above this transitory shame In distant years. But to be wither'd thusâ In the first budding of my fortune, doom'd To bear the death of hope, and to outlive it! Gods, keep me patient! I will to my task. [Going. Re-enter Creon and Lycus. LYCUS. Wilt thou not join thy fellows at the feast, And taste a cup of wine the king vouchsafes For merriment to-day? THOAS. What! are they merry? LYCUS. Dost thou not hear them? THOAS. They are slaves, indeed! Forgive me, I would rather to the quarry. [Going. Enter Messenger. MESSENGER (addressing Creon). My lord, the games in honour of our triumph Await thee,âfirst the chariot race, in which Thy son prepares to strive. The wrestlers nextâ CREON. Let them begin. [Exit Messenger. Methinks yon captive's strength, No longer rebel, might afford us sport. Thoas! THOAS. I wait thy pleasure. CREON. Thou wert train'd Doubtless, at home, to manly exercise, And I would have thee show the youth of Corinth How the Athenians throw the quoit and wrestle. THOAS. My lord, I cannot do it! CREON. One so strong As thou, had he been native here, would joy In sports like these. THOAS. O, have I not enjoy'd them! My lord, I am content to toil and mournâ 'Tis the slave's part; these limbs are thine to use In vilest service till their sinews fail; But not a nerve shall bend in sports I lov'd When freeman to indulge in, for the gaze Of those who were my foes and are my masters. Enter Messenger, in haste. MESSENGER. My lordâthe princeâ THOAS. Is he in peril? MESSENGER. As his chariot, far Before all rivals, glitter'd to the goal, The coursers plung'd as if some fearful thing Unseen by human eyes had glar'd on theirs; Then with a speed like lightning flash'd, along The verge of the dark precipice which girds The rock-supported plain, and round it still In frightful circles whirl the youth; no power Of man can stay them. THOAS. Friend, I come! I come! LYCUS. [Attempting to stop him. Thou must not go. THOAS. Away! I'm master now. [Rushes out. CREON. My son! my son! I shall embrace thy corpse, And lie beside it. Yet I cannot bear This anguish; dead or living, I will seek thee! [Exit. LYCUS. [Looking out. How the slave spurns the dust; with what a power He cleaves the wondering throng,âthey hide him now,â Speed him, ye gods of Corinth! Enter Creusa. CREUSA. Whence that cry Of horror mingled with my brother's name? Is he in danger? Wherefore dost thou stand Thus silently, and gaze on empty air? Speak! Enter Iphitus. [Creusa addressing him. From thy sacred lips the truth Must flow. IPHITUS. Be calm; thy brother is preserv'd; Urg'd by his furious steeds, his chariot hung Scarce pois'd on the rock's margin, where the vale Lies deepest under it; an instant more, And Hyllus, who serenely stood with eyes Fix'd on the heavens, had perish'd; when a form With god-like swiftness clove the astonish'd crowd; Appear'd before the coursers, scarce upheld By tottering marl;âstrain'd forward o'er the gulf Of vacant ether; caught the floating reins, And drew them into safety with a touch So fine, that sight scarce witness'd it. The prince Is in his father's arms. CREUSA. Thou dost not speak The hero's name;âyet can I guess it well. IPHITUS. Thoas.âHe comes. CREUSA. Let me have leave to thank him. [Exeunt Iphitus and Lycus. Enter Thoas. Hero! accept a maiden's fervent thanks, All that she has to offer, for a life Most precious to her. THOAS. Speak not of it, fair one! Life, in my estimate, 's too poor a boon To merit thanks so rich. CREUSA. Not such a life As his to me. We both together drew Our earliest breath, and one unconscious crime Shar'd; for the hour that yielded us to day Snatch'd her who bore us. Thence attach'd we grew, As if some portion of that mother's love Each for the other cherish'd; twin-born joys, Hopes, fancies, and affections, each hath watch'd In the clear mirror of the other's soul, By that sweet union doubled. Thou hast sav'd Two lives in saving Hyllus. THOAS. 'Tis not meet That such a wretch as I, in garb like this, [Looking at his dress, and shuddering. Should listen to the speech of one so fair; It will unfit me for my tasks. CREUSA. Thy tasks? O hard injustice! Enter Hyllus, Creusa meeting him. Brother, join thy thanks To mine. [Hyllus and Creusa embrace. THOAS. No more. [Retiring. Grant, ye immortal gods, So beautiful a bond be never broken! [Exit Thoas. CREUSA. He speaks of tasks. My brother, can'st endure To see a hero who hath twice preserv'd Thy lifeâupon whose forehead virtue sits Enthron'd in regal majestyâthus held In vilest thraldom? HYLLUS. Ah! my sweet Creusa, Thy words breathe more than gratitude. CREUSA. My brother, I pray thee, do not look into my face. HYLLUS. Nay, raise thy head, and let thine eye meet mine; It reads no anger there. Thy love is pure And noble as thyself, and nobly plac'd; And one day shall be honor'd. CREUSA. Spare me! HYLLUS. Come, The banquet hath begun; the king expects us. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Banqueting-Hall in Creon's Palace. Creon, Ismene, Iphitus, Calchas, and Corinthians, seated at the Banquet. CREON. [Rising. I thank ye for my son;âhe is unharm'd, And soon will join our revelry. ISMENE. We lack Attendance. Where is Thoas? It were fit In Corinth's day of triumph, he should wait On his victorious enemies. Go seek him. [Exit an Attendant. CREON. I would have spar'd his services to-day; He is but young in service, and hath done A glorious deed. Drink round, my friends, and pledge My son once more. ISMENE. My sovereign, I should deem So great a master in the skill to tame The nature struggling in a free-born soul, Would think it wisdom to begin betimes, When an Athenian spirit should be stifled. If thou would'st bend him to the yoke, 'twere best Commence to-day;âto-morrow 't may be vain. Enter Thoas. Athenian!âslave!â'tis well that thou hast come; Else might we fear thou didst not feel so proud As such a man as thou should feel, to wait Upon his victor. Carry round the cup, And bear it to the king, with duteous looks. THOAS. I will endeavour, lady. [Takes the cup, and speaking aside. They will join In very openness of heart, to cast This shame upon me; take the mantling cup With thoughtless pleasure from a warrior's hand, And smile to see it quiver; bless the wine With household names, sweet thoughts of friends afar, Or love which death hath hallowed; and while springs Of cordial joy are quicken'd by the draught, Will bid affections, generous as their own, Shrink, agonize, and wither! ISMENE. Slave! attend! Enter Hyllus and Creusa. CREON. Hyllus, our friends have pledg'd thee; take thy place, And thank them. HYLLUS. [Advancing. I am grateful.âThoas, thus? CREON. We blam'd thy absence, daughter. Sit beside The queen. CREUSA. A humbler place befits me, father. [Sits at the end of the circle. [Thoas attempts to hand the cup. CREUSA. [To Hyllus. Brother, dost see? HYLLUS. [Aside to Thoas, taking the cup from him. Thoas, I blush at this; Give me the cup.âCorinthian citizens, This is a moment when I cannot trust The grace of serving you to any hand Except mine own. The wine will send a glow Of rare delight when minister'd by one Who hath this day touch'd life's extremest verge, And been most bravely rescued. [Hyllus hands the cup. ISMENE. Will the king Permit this mockery? CREON. Foolish stripling, cease! Let the slave hand the cup; and having pass'd Another round, fill high, for I will pour A great libation out, with such a prayer As every heart shall echo while the dust Of Corinth drinks it in. [Thoas takes the cup, and approaches Creusa. CREUSA. Nay, tremble not. Think thou dost pay free courtesy to one Who in the fulness of a grateful heart, Implores the gods to cherish thee with hope For liberty and honour. THOAS. Words so sweet Reward and o'erpay all. CREON. Corinthians, rise! Before the gods, who have this day espoused The cause of Corinth, I this votive cup Pour with one glorious prayerâRuin to Athens! [Thoas dashes down the cup he is about to hand to the King. THOAS. Ruin to Athens! who dares echo that? Who first repeats it dies. These limbs are arm'd With vigour from the gods that watch above Their own immortal offspring. Do ye dream, Because chance lends ye one insulting hour, That ye can quench the purest flame the gods Have lit from heaven's own fire? HYLLUS. [Trying to appease the guests. 'Tis ecstasyâ Some phrenzy shakes him. THOAS. No! I call the gods, Who bend attentive from their azure thrones, To witness to the truth of that which throbs Within me now. 'Tis not a city crown'd With olive and enrich'd with peerless fanes Ye would dishonour, but an opening world Diviner than the soul of man hath yet Been gifted to imagineâtruths serene, Made visible in beauty, that shall glow In everlasting freshness; unapproach'd By mortal passion; pure amidst the blood And dust of conquests; never waxing old; But on the stream of time, from age to age, Casting bright images of heavenly youth To make the world less mournful. I behold them! And ye, frail insects of a day, would quaff âRuin to Athens!â CREON. Are ye stricken all To statues, that ye hear these scornful boasts, And do not seize the traitor? Bear him hence, And let the executioner's keen steel Prevent renewal of this outrage. IPHITUS. Hold! Some god hath spoken through him. ISMENE. Priest! we need No counsel from thee. HYLLUS. Father, he will bendâ 'Twas madnessâwas't not, Thoas?âanswer me: Retract thy words! THOAS. I've spoken, and I'll die. ISMENE. 'Twere foolish clemency to end so soon The death pangs of a slave who thus insults The king of Corinth. I can point a cell Deep in the rock, where he may wait thy leisure To frame his tortures. HYLLUS. [To Creon. If thou wilt not spare, Deal with him in the light of day, and gaze Thyself on what thou dost, but yield him not A victim to that cold and cruel heart. ISMENE. [Aside. Cold! I must bear that too. (Aloud.) Thou hear'st him, king; Thou hear'st the insolence, which waxes bolder Each day, as he expects thy lingering age Will yield him Corinth's throne. CREON. Ungrateful boy! Go, wander alien from my love; avoid The city's bounds; and if thou dare return Till I proclaim thy pardon, think to share The fate of the rash slave for whom thou plead'st. THOAS. King, I will grovel in the dust before thee; Will give these limbs to torture; nay, will strain Their free-born sinews for thy very sport, So thou recall the sentence on thy son. CREON. Thou wilt prolong his exile. To thy cell! [To Thoas. There wait thy time of death;âmy heart is sickâ But I have spoken. HYLLUS. Come with me, sweet sister, And take a dearer parting than this scene Admits. Look cheerily;âI leave thy soul A duty which shall lift it from the sphere Of sighs and tremblings. Father, may the gods So cherish thee that thou may'st never mourn, With more than fond regret, the loss of one Whose love stays with thee ever. [Exeunt Hyllus and Creusa. IPHITUS. [Offering to support Creon. Hold! he faints! CREON. No;âI can walk unaidedârest will soothe me. [Exit Creon. ISMENE. Good night, my friends! [Exeunt all but Ismene, Thoas, and Calchas. Thou, Calchas, wait and guard The prisoner to his cell. Thou know'st the place. THOAS. Lead on. ISMENE. [Coming to the front to Thoas. Thou wilt not sleep? THOAS. I wish no sleep To reach these eyes, till the last sleep of all. ISMENE. Others may watch as well as thou. THOAS. Strange words Thou speakest, fearful woman; are they mockeries? Methinks they sound too solemn. ISMENE. Said I not, I am of Athens? Hush! These walls have echoes; Thy gaoler is of Athens, too; at midnight He shall conduct thee where we may discourse In safety. Wilt thou follow him? THOAS. I will. ISMENE. 'Tis well. Conduct the prisoner to his dungeon. Remember, thou hast promis'd me. THOAS. My blood Is cold as ice; yet will I keep the faith I plight to thee. [Exeunt Thoas and Calchas. ISMENE (alone). It is the heroic form Which I have seen in watching, and in sleep Frightfully broken, through the long, long, years Which I have wasted here in chains, more sad Than those which bind the death-devoted slave To his last stony pillow. Fiery shapes, That have glar'd in upon my bed to mock My soul with hopes of vengeance, keep your gaze Fix'd stedfast on me now! My hour is nigh! [Exit. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Dungeon in the Rock. Thoas discovered, alone. THOAS. Ye walls of living rock, whose time-shed stains Attest that ages have revolv'd since hands Of man were arm'd to pierce your solid frame, And, from your heart of adamant, hew out Space for his fellow's wretchedness, I hail A refuge in your stillness; tyranny Will not stretch forth its palsied arm to fret Its captive here. Ye cannot clasp me round With darkness so substantial, as can shut The airy visions from me which foreshew The glories Athens will achieve, when I Am passionless as ye. I hear a step! It is that mournful lady's minister, Who comes to waken feelings I would bid For ever sleep. A light, as of a star, Gleams in the narrow cavern's steep descent; And now a form, as of a goddess, glides To illuminate its blackness. 'Tis Creusa! My heart is not yet stone. Enter Creusa. I venture here Thus boldly to perform a holy office, Which should have been my brother's.âWhen he fled The city of his nurture, his last thoughts Were bent on his preserver; he bequeathed His strong injunction never to forsake The aim of thy deliverance. I exult That heaven thus far has prosper'd it; be quick, And follow me to freedom. THOAS. Did'st thou say To freedom, lovely one? CREUSA. If thou wilt haste; The path is clear; the city wrapt in sleep; I know the pass-word at the gatesâhow learn'd By quaint device, I'll tell thee when we meet In safety,âif we ever meet again! THOAS. And dost thou wish it? CREUSA. Do I wish it? Yes! And on the swift fulfilment of that wish My life is wager'd. THOAS. There is more than life To me in these sweet wordsâspeak them againâ But no;âonce heard they linger on the ear Which drank them in, for ever. Shapeless rocks That witness to the sound, rejoice! No fane Of alabaster while the breeze has slept In circling myrtles, and the moon disclos'd Young love's first blush to the rapt eyes of him Whose happy boldness rais'd it, rivals you In sanctity which rich affection lends To things of earthly mould. Methinks ye spring Rounded to columns; your dank mists are curl'd Upwards in heavenly shapes, and breathe perfume, While every niche which caught the music speeds Delicious echoes to the soul. 'Twere bliss To dwell for ever here. CREUSA. O linger not; The watch will change at midnight. THOAS. MidnightâJove!â I cannot go. CREUSA. Not go! I ask no thanksâ No recompenseâno boon,âsave the delight Of saving thee; for this I've perill'd allâ Life, freedom, fame,âand now thou tell'st me, proud one, That I have perill'd all in vain. THOAS. Forbear, In mercy; I have pledg'd my word to wait A messenger the Queen will send at midnight, To bring me to her presence. CREUSA. To the Queen? What would she with thee? She is steel'd 'gainst nature; I never knew her shed a tear, nor heard A sigh break from her,âoft she seeks a glen Hard by the temple of avenging Jove, Which sinks mid blasted rocks, whose narrow gorge Scarce gives the bold explorer space; its sides, Glistening in marble blackness, rise aloft From the scant margin of a pool, whose face No breeze e'er dimpled; in its furthest shade A cavern yawns, where poisonous vapours rise That none may enter it and live; they spread Their rolling films of ashy white like shrouds Around the fearful orifice, and kill The very lichens which the earthless stone Would nurture;âwhether evil men, or things More terrible, meet this sad lady there, I know notâshe will lead thee thither! THOAS. Noâ Not if guilt point the way, if it be sorrow I must endure it rather than the curse Which lies upon the faithless heart of him Who breaks a promise plighted to the wretched; For she is wretched. CREUSA. So am I. Methinks I am grown selfish; for it is not suffering I dread should fall upon thee, but I tremble Lest witchery of that awful woman's grief Lead thee to some rash deed. Thou art a soldier, A young proficient in the game of death, And mayst be wrought onâ THOAS. Do not fear for me; Where shews of glory beckon I'll not wait To pluck away the radiant masks and find Death under them; but at the thought of blood Shed save in hottest fight, my spirit shrinks As from some guilt not aim'd at human things But at the majesty of gods. CREUSA. Forgive me; It was a foolish terror swept across My soul,âI should not have forgot 'twas mercy That made thee captive. Voice without. Thoas! THOAS. I am call'd. The voice came that wayâstill thy upward path Is openâhasteâhe must not find thee here. CREUSA. My prayersâall that the weak can giveâare thine. Farewell! [Exit. THOAS. The gods for ever guard thee! She glides awayâshe gains the topmost ridgeâ She's safe. Now can I welcome fate with bosom Steel'd to endure the worst. Voice without. Thoas! THOAS. I come! [Exit. SCENE II. The Hall of Statues, in Creon's Palace. Enter Ismene. ISMENE. Why tarries Calchas? It is past the hour Of deepest night, when he should hither guide The avenger of my sorrows. Gods of Athens! Whom strong expostulation hath compell'd To look upon my shames, one little hour I ask your aid; that granted, never more Shall the constraining force of passion break Your dread repose. I hear a warrior's stepâ Ye answer, and ye bless me. Enter Calchas and Thoas. It is well. [To Calchas. Withdraw, and wait without. I must confer With this unyielding man, alone. [Exit Calchas. THOAS. I wait To learn thy will;âwhy thou hast bid me leave The stubborn rock, where I had grown as dull, As painless, as the cell to which thy breath Consign'd me?âthou, who urg'd the king to wreak His most inglorious spleen on one too low To be mark'd out for anger, too resolv'd To heed it! ISMENE. I beheld in thee a soldier, Born of that glorious soil whose meanest son Is nobler than barbarian kings, with arm Worthy to serve a daughter, who has claim On its best blood. But there is softness in thee, Weakening thy gallant nature, which may need The discipline of agony and shame To master it. Hast thou already learn'd Enough to steel thee for a generous deed; Or shall I wait till thou hast linger'd long In sorrow's mighty school? I'm mistress in it, And know its lessons well. THOAS. If thou hast aught Of honor to suggest, I need no more To fit me for thy purpose; if thy aim Hath taint of treachery or meanness in it, I think no pain will bend me to thy will; At least, I pray the gods so! ISMENE. Had'st thou borne Long years of lingering wretchedness like mine, Thou would'st not play the casuist thus. 'Tis well For lusty youth, that casts no glance beyond To-morrow's fight or game, which values life A gewgaw, to be perill'd at a plunge From some tall rock into an eddying gulph, For the next revel's glory, to collect The blood into the cheek, and bravely march Amidst admiring people to swift death, And call its heedlessness of what it yieldsâ A sacrifice heroic. But who knows, Who guesses, save the woman that endures, What 'tis to pine each weary day in forms All counterfeit;âeach night to seek a couch Throng'd by the phantoms of revenge, till age Find her in all things weaken'd, save the wish, The longing of the spirit, which laughs out In mockery of the withering frame! O Thoas, I have endured all thisâI, who am sprung From the great race of Theseus! THOAS. From the race Of Theseus!âof the godlike man whose name Hath shone upon my childhood as a star With magic power? ISMENE. Reduc'd to basest needs By slow decay in Attica, array'd In hateful splendour here, I bear small trace Of whence I sprung. No matterâspurn'dâdisown'd By living kindred, I have converse held With those of my great family whom Death Hath stripp'd of all but glory; and they wait The triumph of this hour to hail me theirs. THOAS. Shame to our city, who allowed a matron Of that great race to languish! ISMENE. Let it pass; A single griefâa short and casual wrongâ Whichâin that sense of ages past and hopes Resplendent for the future, which are center'd In the great thought of country, and make rich The poorest citizen who feels a share In herâis nothing. Had she sought my blood, To mingle with the dust before the rush Of some triumphant entry, I had shed it; And while my life gush'd forth, had tasted joy Akin to her rapt hero's. 'Tis thy lotâ Thy glorious lotâto give me all I live for,â Freedom and vengeance. THOAS. What would'st have me do? ISMENE. I have not wasted all the shows of power Which mock'd my grief, but used them to conceal The sparks which tyrant fickleness had lit, And sloth had left to smoulder. In the depths Of neighbouring caverns, foes of Creon meet Who will obey thee; lead them thence to-nightâ Surprise the palaceâslay this hated king,â Or bear him as a slave to Athens. THOAS. Never! I am a foe to Corinthânot a traitor, Nor will I league with treason. In the love Of my own land, I honour his who cleaves To the scant graces of the wildest soil, As I do to the loveliness, the might, The hope, of Athens. Aught else man can do, In honor, shall be thine. ISMENE. I thought I knew Athenians well; and yet, thy speech is strange. Whence drew thou these affections,âwhence these thoughts Which reach beyond a soldier's sphere? THOAS. From Athens; Her groves; her halls; her temples; nay, her streets Have been my teachers. I had else been rude, For I was left an orphan, in the charge Of an old citizen, who gave my youth Rough though kind nurture. Fatherless, I made The city and her skies my home; have watch'd Her various aspects with a child's fond love; Hung in chill morning o'er the mountain's brow, And, as the dawn broke slowly, seen her grow Majestic from the darkness, till she fill'd The sight and soul alike; enjoy'd the storm Which wrapt her in the mantle of its cloud, While every flash that shiver'd it reveal'd Some exquisite proportion, pictur'd once And ever to the gazer;âstood entranc'd In rainy moonshine, as, one side, uprose A column'd shadow, ponderous as the rock Which held the Titan groaning with the sense Of Jove's injustice; on the other, shapes Of dreamlike softness drew the fancy far Into the glistening air; but most I felt Her loveliness, when summer-evening tints Gave to my lonely childhood sense of home. ISMENE. And was no spot amidst that radiant waste A home to thee indeed? THOAS. The hut which held My foster-father had for me no charms, Save those his virtues shed upon its rudeness. I lived abroad;âand yet there is a spot Where I have felt that faintness of the heart Which traces of oblivious childhood bring Upon ripe manhood; where small heaps of stones, Blacken'd by fire, bear witness to a tale Of rapine which destroyed my mother's cot, And bore her thence to exile. ISMENE. Mighty gods! Where stand these ruins? THOAS. On a gentle slope. Broken by workings of an ancient quarry, About a furlong from the western gate, Stand these remains of penury; one olive, Projecting o'er the cottage site which fire Had blighted, with two melancholy stems, Stream'd o'er its meagre vestiges. ISMENE. 'Tis plain! Hold! hold! my courage. Let the work be done, And then I shall aspire. I must not wait Another hour for vengeance. Dreadful powers! Who on the precipice's side at eve Have bid gigantic shadows greyly pass Before my mortal vision,âdismal forms Of a fate-stricken raceâI see HIM now, Whom ye led follower of your ghastly trainâ O nerve him for his office! THOAS. Fearful woman, Speak thy command, if thou would have it reach A conscious ear; for whilst thou gazest thus, My flesh seems hardening into stone; my soul Is tainted; thought of horror courses thought Like thunder-clouds swept wildly;âyet I feel That I must do thy bidding. ISMENE. It is well;â Hast thou a weapon? THOAS. Yes; the generous prince, When I resign'd my arms, left me a dagger. ISMENE. The prince! The Furies sent it by his hand, For justice on his father. THOAS. On thy husband? ISMENE. Husband! Beware!âmy husband moulders yet Within his rusting armour; such a word From thee may pierce the rock beneath whose shade He fell, and curse him with a moment's life To blast thee where we stand. If this slight king, In the caprice of tyranny was pleas'd To deck me out in regal robes, dost think That in his wayward smiles, or household taunts, I can forget the wretchedness and shame He hurl'd upon me once? THOAS. What shame? ISMENE. What shame! Thou hast not heard it. Listen! I was pluck'd From the small pressure of an only babe, And in my frenzy, sought the hall where Creon Drain'd the frank goblet; fell upon my knees; Embrac'd his foot-stool with my hungry arms, And shriek'd aloud for liberty to seek My infant's ashes, or to hear some news Of how it perish'd;âCreon did not deign To look upon me, but with reckless haste Dash'd me to earth;âyes; this disgrace he cast On the proud daughter of a line which trac'd Its skiey lineage to the gods, and bore The impress of its origin,âon me, A woman, and a mother! THOAS. Let me fly And whet Athenian anger with thy wrongsâ My thoughts are strange and slaughterous. ISMENE. [After a pause. Fly then! Yes!â (Aside.) 'T will be as certain.âI will point a way Will lead thee through a chamber to the terrace, Whence thou may'st reach the wall. Thy only peril Lies in that chamber. Mark me well;âif there An arm be rais'd to stay theeâif a voice Be heardâor if aught mortal meet thy sight, Whate'er the form, thy knife is pledged to quench The life that breathes there. THOAS. I obey. Farewell! [He takes her hand; she shivers; and drops it. ISMENE. Hold off thy handâit thrills me.âSwear! THOAS. By those Who hover o'er us now, I swear! ISMENE. Be firm. That is the door;âthou canst not miss the path. Is thy steel ready? THOAS. Yes;âmy breast is cold As is that steel. ISMENE. Hasteâthe thick darkness wanes. [Exit Thoas. Infernal powers! I thank yeâall is paidâ By thousand ectsasies in which my soul Grows wanton. Calchas! Enter Calchas. Wish me joy, old servant! What dost thou think of him who left me now? CALCHAS. A gallant soldier. ISMENE. 'Tis my sonâmy own! The very child for whom I knelt to Creon, Is sent to give me justice. He is gone, Arm'd with a dagger, thro' the royal chamber, Sworn to strike any that may meet him there A corpse before him. Dost thou think the king Will see to-morrow? CALCHAS. He may slumber. ISMENE. Noâ He hath sent his son to exileâhe will wakeâ I'm sure he will. There! listen!â'twas a groan! 'Twill be but lowâagain! 'Tis finish'd! Shades Of my immortal ancestry, look down, And own me of your kindred!âCalchas, haste; Secure possession of the towers that guard The city gates:âentrust them to our friends, Who, when I give the word, will set them wide. Haste, 'tis thy final labour. I shall soon Be potent to reward the friends who clove To me in my sad bondage. CALCHAS. Whither go'st thou? ISMENE. To the pale shrine of her whose withering shield Is dedicate to Athens. I have pray'd At coldest midnight there, without a hope Which might give ardour to my freezing veins. I ask her to allay my raptures now, By touch of marbleâI require its chillness. There I'll await the issue. It is sure! [Exeunt Ismene and Calchas. SCENE III. The Outskirts of a Wood on one side; the Athenian Camp on the other. A Watch-fire at a little distance, lighting the Scene. PENTHEUS (walking backwards and forwards as a Guard). The cold grey dawn begins to glimmer; speed it, Ye powers that favour Athens! From the sea, Her everlasting guardian, PhÅbus, rise, To pour auspicious radiance o'er the field, In which she may efface the foul dishonour Her arms own'd yesterday. Not shame alone, But loss no morrow can repair, is hers! Archas, our army's noble leader, sleeps Beneath the pressure of a thousand shields; And Thoas, bravest of our youth, a slaveâ Perchance, ere this a corpse. Friend whom I loved, In whose advancing glories I grew proud As though they had been mineâif yet thou breathest, I will deliver, and if dead, avenge thee! O, Thoas! Enter Thoas wildly, from the Wood. THOAS. Who pronounc'd that wretched name,â That name no honest tongue may utter more? Pentheus! PENTHEUS. Thoas! most welcome. Thou art come in time To share a glorious conflict. Ha! thine eyes Glare with a frightful light;âbe calm,âthou art safe;â This is the camp of those who will reward Thy great emprise of yesterday, with place Among the foremost in the battle. Come To my exulting heart. [Offering to embrace Thoas. THOAS. No!âhold me from thee!â My heart can ne'er know fellowship again With such as thine; for I have paid a price For this vile liberty to roam abroad, And cry to woods and rocks that answer me With fearful echoes:âsuch a price, my Pentheusâ My own unspotted conscience. Dost not see Foul spots of blood upon this slave's apparel, Polluting e'en that dress? PENTHEUS. If thou hast struck Some soldier down to vindicate thy freedom, Who shall accuse thee? THOAS. 'Twas no soldier, Pentheus; No stout opponent that my fatal knife Dismiss'd to Erebus. A wither'd hand, As from an old man, in the gloom stretch'd forth, Scarce met my touch,âwhich could not have delay'd My course an instant;â'twas no thought of fear, No haste for freedom, urged me,âbut an oath Glar'd on my soul in characters of flame, And madden'd me to strike. I rais'd my arm, And wildly hurl'd my dagger;ânought but air It seem'd to meet;âbut a sharp feeble sigh, Such as death urges when it stops the gasp Of wasting age, assur'd me it had done A murderer's office. PENTHEUS. Think not of it thus:â Thy lips are parch'd,âlet me fetch water. THOAS. No! I have drank fiercely at a mountain spring, And left the stain of blood in its pure waters; It quench'd my mortal thirst, and I rejoic'd, For I seem'd grown to demon, till the stream Cool'd my hot throat, and then I laugh'd aloud, To find that I had something human still. PENTHEUS. Fret not thy noble heart with what is past. THOAS. No!â'tis not past!âthe murderer has no PAST; But one eternal PRESENT. HYLLUS. [Within the wood. Help me!âanswer!â THOAS. The voice of Hyllus!âof that noble youth, Who, for my sake, is outcast from his home, So near the camp of Athens! Should our guards Arrest him, he will perish. Friend! That voice Comes on my ear like that of one who serv'd me, In yonder city; leave thy watch to me A moment. PENTHEUS. Noâthy passion's dangerous; I dare not trust it. THOAS. SeeâI have subdu'd The pang which wrung me. By our ancient loves Grant me this boonâperhaps the last. PENTHEUS. Be quick, For the watch presently will be remov'd, And the trump call to battle. [Exit Pentheus. THOAS. [Calling to Hyllus. Here! The hope Of saving Hyllus wafts into my soul A breath of comfort. Enter Hyllus. HYLLUS. I have lost my path, Wandering the dismal night in this old wood; I'd seek the coast; canst thou point out the way? THOAS. Avoid itâon each side the Isthmus, ships Of Athens ride at anchor. HYLLUS. [Recognising him. Thoas! freeâ Then I am bless'd, and I can bear my lot, However hard;âI guess the hand that op'd The dungeon door;âhow didst thou quit the palace? THOAS. Why dost thou ask me that? Through a large chamber That open'd on a terraceâ'twas all dark;â Tell me who lay there? HYLLUS. 'Tis my father's chamber, Did he awake? THOAS. Thy father?âgods! The king? The feeble old man with the reverend hair? Art sure he rested there? HYLLUS. Sure. No one else May enter after sunset, save the queen. THOAS. The queen! all's clear;âJove strike me into marble! HYLLUS. Why dost thou tremble so? as if a fit Of ague shook thee. THOAS. Nothingâonly thought Of my past danger came upon my soul And shook it strangely. Was the old man there? [Stands abstractedly as stupefied. PENTHEUS. [Without. Thoas! THOAS. Haste!âDo not lose a momentâfly! The watch-fire that is waning now is fed By hands which, madden'd by the foul defeat Of yesterday, will slay thee. HYLLUS. Whither fly? The camp of Athens is before me;âships Of Athens line the coasts,âand Corinth's king Hath driven me forth an exile. I'll return And crave my father's pardon. THOAS. Noânot thereâ Yet, where should the poor stripling go? O Jove! When he shall learnâ HYLLUS. Farewellâyet hold an instant!â Wilt thou not send some message to Creusa, That she may greet her brother with a smile? THOAS. Creusa smile!âMethinks I see her nowâ Her form expandsâher delicate features grow To giant stone; her hairs escape their band, And stream aloft in air;âand now they take The forms of fiery serpentsâhow they hissâ And point their tongues at Thoas! HYLLUS. This is frenzy; I cannot leave thee thus:âwhate'er my fate, I will attend and soothe thee. THOAS. Soothe me!âBoy, Wouldst haunt me with that face which now I see Is like thy father's. Ha! ha! ha! Thou soothe meâ Look not upon me; by this lurid light Thou look'st a spectre. Hence, or I will rend thee! HYLLUS. I rather would die here. THOAS. Fool! fool! away! [Exit Hyllus. He's goneâyet she is with me still,âwith looks More terrible than anger;âtake away That patient face,âI cannot bear its sweetness;â Earth, cover me! [Falls on the ground. Enter Pentheus. PENTHEUS. The troops are arming fast; They call on thee to lead them.âHark, the trumpâ [The trumpet sounds. THOAS. [Leaps up. Yes; I will answer to its call. Again Thou shalt behold me strike. In yonder field I'll win that which I hunger for. PENTHEUS. A crown Of laurel which hath floated in thy dreams From thy brave infancyâ THOAS. A grave! a grave! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The interior of the Funereal Grove at Corinth. The Urn of Creon. Creusa discovered bending over it. CREUSA. 'Tis strange!âI cannot weep for him; I've tried To reckon every artifice of love Which mid my father's waywardness proclaim'd His tenderness unalter'd;âfelt again The sweet caresses infancy receiv'd, And read the prideful look that made them sweeter, Have run the old familiar round of things Indifferent, on which affection hangs In delicate remembrances which make Each household custom sacred;âI've recall'd From Memory's never-failing book of pain, My own neglects of dutiful regard Too frequentâall that should provoke a tearâ And all in vain. My feelings are as dull, Mine eyes are rigid as when first they met The horrid vision of his thin white hairs Matted with blood. Gods! let me know again A touch of natural grief, or I shall go Distract, and think the bloody form is here. Enter Hyllus. Hyllus! my brother! thou wilt make me weep, For we shall mourn as we were lov'd together. Dost thou know all? HYLLUS. Yes, all.âAlas! Creusa, He died in anger with me. CREUSA. Do not dwell On that sad thought;âbut recollect the cause Was nobleâthe defence of one whose soul Claims kindred with thine own. HYLLUS. Unhappy sister, What sorrow stranger than thy present grief Awaits thee yet! I cannot utter it. CREUSA. Speak;âany words of thine will comfort me. HYLLUS. I fear thou must no longer link the thoughts Of nobleness and Thoas. CREUSA. Then my soul Must cease all thinkings; for I've blended them Till they have grown inseparate. What is this? HYLLUS. That he hath made us orphans. CREUSA. He is free From such ignoble guiltiness as thou. What fury shed this thought into a soul Once proud to be his debtor? HYLLUS. Poor believer In virtue's dazzling counterfeit, 'tis sad To undeceive thee. At the break of day I met the murderer, frantic from his crime, In anguish which explain'd by after proofs Attests his guilt. CREUSA. And is this all? Hast said? All thou canst urge against the nobleness Which breathes in every word? Against thy life Preserv'd at liberal hazard of his own? Against the love which I was proud to bear For him, and that with which he more than paid me? He in some frenzy utter'd aimless words, And thou at once believ'd him guilty. Go! Haste and accuse him. Henceforth we are twain. HYLLUS. Sister, I never will accuse him. CREUSA. Take My thanks for that small promise, though our souls, While thine is tainted with this foul belief, Can ne'er be mingled as they have been. Now I see why I was passionless. Ismene Bends her steps hither; thou hadst best retire; She rules the city, for her secret friends Cast off their masks, and own themselves the foes Of Corinth's prince. HYLLUS. Beside my father's urn I shall await her. CREUSA. I will not expose My anguish to her cold and scornful gaze;â Brother, farewell awhile; we are divided, But I will bless thee. [Exit. Enter Ismene and Guards. ISMENE. Wherefore art thou here, Despite the sentence which the king pronounc'd Of exile? HYLLUS. I have come to mourn a father, Whose words of passion had been long unsaid, Had his kind heart still throbb'd; and next, to claim My heritage. ISMENE. Thine!âwin it if thou canstâ Enter Calchas. How stands the battle? CALCHAS. Corinth's soldiers fly, Routed in wild disorder. Thoas leads The troops of Athens, and will soon appear In triumph at our gates. ISMENE. Leads, say'st thou?âleads? Let Corinth's gates stand open to admit The hero,âgive him conduct to the hall, Where sculptur'd glories of Corinthian kings Shall circle him who sham'd them,âthere, alone, I would crave speech with him. [Exit Calchas. HYLLUS. [To the Soldiers. My countrymen, Will ye endure this shame? I am a youth Unskill'd in war; but I have learn'd to die When life is infamy. If ye will join me, We'll close the gates with ramparts of the slain. Does no heart answer mine? ISMENE. Their swords shall curb Thy idle ravings. Athens triumphs now!â Attend him to his chamber, and beware He leaves it not. HYLLUS. For this I ought to thank thee: I would not see my country's foul disgrace; But thou shalt tremble yet. [Exit, guarded. ISMENE. Now shall I clasp himâ Clasp him a victor o'er my country's foes;â The slayer of him most hated. Double transport! The dream of great revenge I lived upon Was never bright with image of such joy, And now comes link'd with vengeance! Thoas, haste! [Exit. SCENE II. Before the Gates of Corinth. Shouts without. Enter Thoas in armour, with his sword drawn, and Athenian Soldiers, as in pursuit. THOAS. Here we may breathe awhile from conquest; 'twas A noble chase, we scarce may call it battle; Success so quick hath followed on success, That we shall want more time to count our glories Than we have spent in winning them. The foe Is niggard, and will not allow our arms One day of conflict. We have won too soon. Grant me, great gods, instead of years of life, Another such an hour! SOLDIER. My lord, here's wine; 'Tis from the tents of Corinth. THOAS. Not a drop. My heart's too lightâtoo jocund, to allow Another touch of ecstacy, deriv'd From mortal fruitage; nay, were it Jove's nectar, I'd set the untasted cup of crystal down, And wait till all our glorious work were finish'd! Soldiers! we sup in Corinth! You'll not wait Past time of hunger, if ye are not faint With rapid conquest. Enter Pentheus and Soldiers. PENTHEUS. Noble leader, hail! Thy country's heroes bless thee with the sense Of their delighted wonder! With one voice They greet thee as the winner of this fight, To which thou led them. Never was a scheme Of battle, plann'd in council of the sage, Form'd with a skill more exquisite than that Which, in the instant thou wert call'd to lead us, Flash'd on thy spirit, and in lines of fire From thine was manifest to ours! Art wounded? THOAS. A very scratch; I blush to think no more: Some frolic blood let in the strife had serv'd To moderate my fervours. PENTHEUS. See; our comrades Have snatched a branch from the Corinthian laurels (Which now I fear must wither) for a wreath To grace thy brow! Soldiers, 'tis much I ask; But when I tell ye I have watch'd your chief From the first flash that dazzled in his eye At tale of glory, ye may yield to me The proud delight of offering him this honor. [Soldier gives the wreath to Pentheus, who gives it to Thoas. PENTHEUS. I thank ye, comrades. THOAS. The immortal gods Grant me a double blessing in the friend From whom I take this happiness. O, Pentheus! I have mus'd fondlyâproudlyâon the fate Which waits upon my country; when the brow Which thou wouldst deck, was bar'd to mist and storm; When every moonlit fountain which displaced The blackness of the moss-grown hillock told Of the pure beauty which her name should keep, Empearling starless ages; when each wave That rippled in her harbour to my ear Spoke glad submission to the Queen of Cities; But never, 'mid my burning hopes for Athens, Did I believe that I should stand thus crown'd, Her laurell'd soldier! Friends, the sun-light wanes, And we must sup in Corinth! PENTHEUS. See, the gates Open to welcome us! [The gates open. THOAS. Without a blow? We shall not earn our banquet. So expands Before the vision of my soul, the east To the small cluster of our godlike sons. Let Asia break the mirror of our seas With thousand sterns of ivory, and cast The glare of gold upon them to disturb The azure hue of heaven, they shall be swept As glittering clouds before the sun-like face Of unapplianced virtue! Friends, forgive me; I have been used to idle thought, nor yet Have learn'd to marry it to action. Blest To-day in both. PENTHEUS. A herald from the city. Enter Calchas. CALCHAS. I am commission'd by the queen to speak With Thoas. THOAS. I am here. [Trembles, and supports himself, as paralysed, on Pentheus. Thou art commission'd From the infernal powers to cross my path Of glorious triumph, with a shape that brings Before me terrible remembrance, which Had strangely vanish'd from me. PENTHEUS. [To the Soldiers. He is ill,â Retire. THOAS. Noâshould the herald fade in air He would not leave his office unfulfill'd, One look hath smit my soul. PENTHEUS. Is this a dream? THOAS. Noâ'tis a dreadful wakingâI have dreamt Of honour, and have struggled in my dream For Athens, as if I deserved to fight Unsullied in her cause. The joy of battle In eddies as a whirlpool had engulf'd The thought of one sad moment, when my soul Was blasted; but it rises in the calm, Like to a slaughter'd seaman, who pursues The murderous vessel which swept proudly on, When his death-gurgle ended. Hence, vain wreath!â Thou wouldst entwine my brow with serpent coldness, And wither instant there. [Tears the wreath. So vanish all My hopes; they are goneâI'm fit to answer thee Who sent thee here? [To Calchas. CALCHAS. The queen. THOAS. A worthy mistress Of such a slaveâthy errand? CALCHAS. She who rules In Corinth now, admits the victor's power, And bids the gates thus open: she requires A conference with Thoas in the hall Next to the royal chamberâthou hast been There, as I think, my lord. THOAS. I know full well, Lead, dreadful herald, on. PENTHEUS. The troops attend The order of their general. THOAS. [To Calchas. Why dost wait? Thou see'st that I obey thy call. PENTHEUS. My friend, Thy blood is sever'dâthou may'st choose thy timeâ Postpone this meeting. THOAS. [To Calchas. Why dost tarry? turn Thy face awayâit maddens meâgo on! [Exit after Calchas. SOLDIER. [To Pentheus. My lord, we wait for orders; this strange man, Half warrior and half rhapsodist, may bring Our army into peril. PENTHEUS. Fear it not; He has all elements of greatness in him, Although as yet not perfectly commingled, Which is sole privilege of gods. They cast Such piteous weakness on the noblest men That we may feel them mortal. 'Tis a cloud Which speedily will pass, and thou shalt see The hero shine as clearly forth in council As he has done in victory. Meanwhile He leaves us pleasant dutyâform your linesâ Sound trumpetsâmarch triumphant into Corinth! [The Athenians enter Corinth. SCENE III. The Hall of Statues in the Palace, same as in Third Act. THOAS. [Alone. Again I stand within this awful hall; I found the entrance here, without the sense Of vision; for a foul and clinging mist, Like the damp vapour of a long-closed vault, Is round me. Now its objects start to sight With terrible distinctness! Crimson stains Break sudden on the walls! The fretted roof Grows living! Let me hear a human voice, Or I shall play the madman! Enter Ismene, richly dressed. ISMENE. Noble soldier, I bid thee welcome, with the rapturous heart Of one, for whom thy patriot arm hath wrought Deliverance and revengeâbut more for Athens Than for myself, I hail thee: why dost droop? Art thou oppressed with honours, as a weight Thou wert not born to carry? I will tell That which shall show thee native to the load, And will requite thee with a joy as great As that thou hast conferr'd. Thy life was hid Beneath inglorious accident, till force Of its strong current urged it forth to day, To glisten and expand in sun-light. Know That it has issu'd from a fountain great As is its destiny.âThou sharest with me The blood of Theseus. THOAS. If thy speech is true, And I have something in me which responds To its high tidings, I am doom'd to bear A heavier woe than I believ'd the gods Would ever lay on mortal; I have stood Unwittingly upon a skiey height, By ponderous gloom encircled,âthou hast shown The mountain-summit mournfully revers'd In the black mirror of a lurid lake, Whose waters soon shall cover me,âI've stain'd A freeman's nature; thou hast shown it sprung From gods and heroes, and wouldst have me proud Of the foul sacrilege. ISMENE. If that just deed, Which thus disturbs thy fancy, were a crime, What is it in the range of glorious acts, Past and to come, to which thou art allied, But a faint speck, an atom, which no eye But thine would dwell on? THOAS. It infests them all, Spreads out funereal blackness as they pass In sad review before me. Hadst thou pour'd This greatness on my unpolluted heart, How had it bounded! now it tortures me, From thee, fell sorceress, who snar'd my soul Hereâin this very hall!âMay the strong curse Which breathes from out the ruins of a nature Blasted by guiltâ ISMENE. Hold! Parricideâforbear! She whom thou hast aveng'd, she whom the death Of Creon hath set free, whom thou wouldst curse, Is she who bore thee! THOAS. Thou! ISMENE. Dost doubt my word? Is there no witness in thy mantling blood Which tells thee whence 'twas drawn? Is nature silent? If, from the mists of infancy, no form Of her who, sunk in poverty, forgat Its ills in tending thee, and made the hopes Which glimmer'd in thy smiles her comfort,âgleams Upon thee yet;âhast thou forgot the night When foragers from Corinth toss'd a brand Upon the roof that shelter'd thee; dragg'd out The mother from the hearth-stone where she sat, Resign'd to perish, shrieking for the babe Whom from her bosom they had rent? That child Now listens. As in rapid flight, I gazed Backward upon the blazing ruin, shapes Of furies, from amid the fire, look'd out And grinn'd upon me. Every weary night While I have lain upon my wretched bed, They have been with me, pointing to the hour Of vengeance. Thou hast wrought it for me, son! Embrace thy mother. THOAS. Would the solid earth Would open, and enfold me in its strong And stifling grasp, that I might be as though I ne'er was born. ISMENE. Dost mock me? I have clasp'd Sorrow and shame as if they were my sons, To keep my heart from hardening into stone; The promis'd hour arriv'd; and when it came, The furies, in repayment, sent an arm, Moulded from mine, to strike the oppressor dead. I triumph'd,âand I sent thee! THOAS. Dost confess That, conscious who I was, thou urg'd my knife Against the king? ISMENE. Confess!âI glory in it!â Thy arm hath done the purpose of my will; For which I bless it. Now I am thy suitor. Victorious hero! Pay me for those cares Long past, which man ne'er guesses at;âfor years Of daily, silent suffering, which young soldiers Have not a word to body forth; for all,â By filling for a moment these fond arms, Which held thee first. THOAS. [Shrinking from her. I cannot. I will kneel, To thank thee for thy love, ere thou didst kill Honour and hope;âthen grovel at thy feet, And pray thee trample out the wretched life Thou gav'st me. ISMENE. Ha! Beware, unfeeling man:â I had oppos'd, had crush'd all human loves, And they were wither'd; thou hast call'd them forth, Rushing in crowds from memory's thousand cells, To scoff at them. Beware! They will not slumber, But sting like scorpions. Enter Iphitus. Wherefore dost intrude On this high conference? IPHITUS. The people cry That solemn inquisition should be held For Creon's blood;âelse do they fear the gods Will visit it on them. ISMENE. They need not fear. It will be well aveng'd. IPHITUS. To thee, Ismene, That which I next must speak, is of dear import;â Wilt hear it in this noble stranger's presence? ISMENE. Say on, old man. IPHITUS. From the old crumbling altar, Just as the gates were open'd, breath'd a voice In whisper low, yet heard through each recess Of Jove's vast temple, bidding us to seek Of thee, Ismene, who the murderer is, And summon thee to the same fearful spot, To speak it there. ISMENE. [To Thoas. Athenian! dost thou hear? THOAS. I hear. IPHITUS. The hostile nations lay aside Their quarrel, till this justice to the dead Is render'd. Chiefs of each will guard the fane, And wait the solemn issue.âIn their name, And in the mightier name of him whose shrine Hath burst long silence, I command thee, queen, Thou presently be there. ISMENE. I shall obeyâ Beside the altar place the regal seat; And there, in state befitting Corinth's queen, I'll take my place. [To Thoas. Farewell! Thou wilt be there! THOAS. Be sure I will not fail. ISMENE. 'Tis well! 'Tis well! [Exit. IPHITUS. Thou saidst thou shouldst attend? THOAS. I shall. What more Would'st thou have with me? IPHITUS. I would ask a band Of the most noble of Athenian youth, To witness this procedure; and to lend Their conduct, should the murderer stand reveal'd, To keep the course of justice unassail'd, And line the path of death. THOAS. All that can make The wretch accurs'd, shall wait him. Let me breathe Alone a moment. [Exit Iphitus. How they'll start to see The guilty one descend the solemn steps, And hang their heads for shame, and turn their eyes In mercy from him. [Going. Enter Creusa. CREUSA. For a moment hear meâ I would not break on thy triumphant hours, But for my brother's sake. Do not refuse, For, if he wrong'd thee by a frantic thought, There was one ready to defend thy honour From slightest taint! THOAS. What taint? the breath of infamy Spreads o'er my name already! CREUSA. Do not askâ 'Twas a wild thought;âbut there are tongues which make As false a charge; tongues which have power to crush The guiltless!âThey have murmur'd that this crime Is that of Hyllus! THOAS. Hyllus the unsullied! CREUSA. I knew that thou would'st say soâthat no force Of circumstance would weigh in thy pure thought Against the beauty of his life. They found him Just after day-break, suddenly return'd From exile, in the chamber of the king, Gazing with bloodless aspect on a sight Of bloodshed;âyet thou dost not think 'twas he That with a craven handâ THOAS. O no! CREUSA. And thou Wilt plead his causeâwilt save him from the fate That threatens his young life? THOAS. My own shall first Be quench'd! CREUSA. The gods repay thee for the word! O brother, brother! could'st thou wrong this heart With one suspicion? Why dost turn away, And shrink and shudder in the warrior's dress, As when I thank'd thee for that brother's life, At the slave's vest which then, in thy proud thought, Debas'd the wearer? THOAS. O, I thought so then! Now I would give the treasures of the deep, Nay moreâthe hope of gloryâto resume Those servile garments with the spotless thoughts Of yesterday. Enter Messenger. MESSENGER. My general, Pentheus, asks If, by thy sanction, Iphitus requires His presence in the temple? THOAS. Pentheus?âYes. CREUSA. [Thoas turns away. Why in the temple? wilt not speak? MESSENGER. The priest There summons all to some high trial. CREUSA. I see it!â They meet to judge my brother. I will flyâ THOAS. Thou must not, ladyâin that fearful place, Horrors unguess'd at by thy gentle nature Will freeze thy youthful blood, that thou shalt pass No happy moment more. CREUSA. And what have I To do with happiness? I am not young, For I grew old in moments charg'd with love And anguish. Now I feel that I could point The murderer out with dreadful skillâcould mark The livid paleness, read the shrinking eye, Detect the empty grasping of the hand Renewing fancied slaughter;âwhy dost turn Thus coldly from me?âAh! thou hast forgot The vows which, when in slavery, thou offer'd, And I was proud to answerâif not, Thoas, Once press my hand; O gods! he lets it fall!â So withers my last hopeâso my poor heart Is broken. [Faints. THOAS. [To Messenger. Take her gently in. [Messenger supports her out. THOAS. One glance. [Looks at her and shudders. O that the beauty I have lov'd and worshipp'd Should be a thing to shiver me!â'Tis just. [Exit. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Interior of the Temple of Jupiter the AvengerâIsmene seated in the midst, in a Chair of StateâCorinthians on the right, and Athenians on the left, side of the Temple âAt the extremity on the right side, Hyllus standing âAt the extremity of the left, Thoas seated. IPHITUS. Corinthians and Athenians! late opposed In mortal conflict, dedicated now To solemn work of Justice, hear the will Of the Avenging Power, beneath whose roof Ye stand thus marshall'd. Royal blood hath stain'd A palace floor;ânot shed in blazing war, But in night's peace; not some hot soldier's blood, But the thin current of a frame made sacred To Orcus' gentlest arrow. Heaven requires Both nations to unite in dealing death Upon the slayer, who, unslain, will draw Its withering curse on both. In yonder shrine Which dim tradition's fearful whispers made A terror to my infancy, a voice, Which breath'd fell murmurs to ancestral ears, Breaks centuries of silence to pronounce The Queen as gifted to direct the shaft To the curs'd head;âand every sign around us By which the world invisible, when charg'd With bloody secret, struggles to subdue Things visible to organs which may send Its meaning to the startled soul, attest The duty I assume.âIsmene! ISMENE. Priest Of Jove, I am attendant to thy summons;â What is thy wish? IPHITUS. Sad widow of a king Whose feeble life some cruel hand hath stopp'd, I do adjure thee, by these hoary hairs, That chang'd their hue from raven whilst thou shar'd His mansion;âby celestial powers, who watch Our firmness now;âand by those fearful gods, Whom 'tis unblest to mention, lay aside All terror, all affection, all remorse,â If cause of penitence thou hast, to rend The veil of darkness which the murderer wears, And give him to his destiny. Begin The solemn strain which shall attune our souls To hearken and to execute! [Solemn music. IPHITUS. Ismene, Speak: Dost thou know the slayer? ISMENE. Yes! IPHITUS. Dost thou Behold him now? ISMENE. [Looking wildly round. I do not see the faces Or know the names of all. Who is the man That at the right side of the circle stands? IPHITUS. The youth with head erect and cloudless brow? That is the orphan'd Hyllus. ISMENE. Who is he That sits upon the the other side, apart, With face averted? [Thoas turns his head suddenly, and looks upon her. I behold him now. It is a dreadful duty you exact From meâa woman. If I speak the name, What sentence follows? IPHITUS. Death! ISMENE. And soon performed? IPHITUS. The Fates require that he thou shalt denounce As guilty, must be led in silence hence, And none behold him after, save his slayers. Attend once more! Thou hast declared thou know'st The guilty one! I ask theeâis he here? ISMENE. O Gods! He is. IPHITUS. Name him! CALCHAS. She shudders! See,â I think she cannot speak! IPHITUS. If quivering tongue Refuse its office, point the victim out. [Ismene rises; turns towards Thoas, who rises, and confronts her; she trembles, pauses, and resumes her seat. IPHITUS. Thou hast confess'd the guilty one is here; Where stands he? [Ismene rises; points to Hyllus, shrieks âThere!â and falls back senseless in her chair. THOAS. 'Tis false! [Creusa rushes forward and embraces Hyllus. CREUSA. Most false! O murderess! Protect him, noble Thoas! HYLLUS. Peace, my sister:â Implore no mortal aid; let us be patient, And suffer calmly what the gods decree. My life may satisfy. IPHITUS. It cannot be! Holdâstir notâbreathe notâfrom that shrine the voice Of heaven will answer hers. Do ye not hear? [A pause. Hark!âIt is voiceless, and the youth is doom'd. THOAS. Forbear, ye murderous judges;âlook upon him! See on his forehead Nature's glorious seal Of innocence, outspeaking thousand voices, Which shining in the presence of the gods Still shows him guiltless. IPHITUS. Prove it. THOAS. With my life-blood! O could ye place me in some dizzy cleft Of inmost Thracian hills, when ribb'd with ice, To hear from every rocky shelf a howl Of wolves arous'd to famine,âI would standâ Calm,âO far calmer than I stand,âto wait Their fangs, and let my tortur'd sinews' strength Attest his cause;â'twere nothingâ'twere no painâ To what the spirit feels. Thou talk'st of curses: Beware! There is no curse with such a power As that of guiltless blood pour'd out by mortals In the mock'd name of justice. HYLLUS. [To Thoas, aside. Thou wilt tell Thy secret;âkeep it. Leave me to my doom. THOAS. Never! Corinthians, hear meâ ISMENE. [Recovering. What is this? Why waits the parricide still there? Who dares Dispute my sentence? THOAS. I! ISMENE. Be silent. She Who most in all the world should have command O'er thee, requires thy silence. PENTHEUS. [Stepping forward from the Athenian rank. By what right Dost thouâQueen of the vanquish'dâdare command The leader of the conquerors? ISMENE. By a mother's. [Thoas sinks into his seatâIsmene descends and stands beside him. ISMENE. Atheniansâvictors!â'tis your fitting name, By which I joy to greet you. Ye behold One whom ye left to suffer, but who boasts Your noblest blood. See! I command my son To quit this roof, and leave me to the work The gods have destined for me. THOAS. Stand aside! I have a suit I would prefer alone, Which may save guilt and sorrow. IPHITUS. [To Hyllus. Lean on me. To Thoas.] Be brief. HYLLUS. I have no need; yet I will take This thy last kindness; for I can accept it Without a blush or shudder. [All retire, leaving Thoas and Ismene in front. THOAS. Why hast heap'd Foul crime on crime? ISMENE. Son! there has been no crime Except for thee. The love that thou hast scorn'd From the heart's long-closed shrine, outwhisper'd fate, And saved thee. THOAS. Saved me! Thou mayest save me yet; Recall thy sentence. Give me truth and death! ISMENE. And own my falsehood? No! Let us go hence Together. THOAS. And permit this youth to die! O that some god would mirror to my soul Our mortal passage, while the arid sand We pace; the yellow, sunless, sky above us; And forms distort with anguish, which shall meet Each vain attempt to be alone, enclose The conscious blasters of the earth, till forced To gaze upon each other, we behold, As in eternal registry, the curse Writ in the face of each! No; let us pray For torture and for peace! ISMENE. If thou remain, And risk dishonour to our house and me, The poisonous cave below shall be my home, And shelter me for ever! THOAS. Thou art brave, As fits a matron of heroic line; Be great in penitence, and we shall meet Absolv'd, where I may join my hand to thine, And walk in duteous silence by thy side. ISMENE. And couldst thou love me then? THOAS. Love thee! My mother, When thou didst speak that word, the gloom of years Was parted,âand I knew again the face Which linger'd o'er my infancy,âso pale, So proud, so beautiful! I kneel again, A child, and plead to that unharden'd heart, By all the long past hours of priceless love, To let my gushing soul pass forth in grace, And bless thee in its parting! ISMENE. Never! THOAS. [Rising. Yes! Haste ere the roof shall fall, and crush the germ Of sweet repentance in us; take thy seat, And speak as thy heart dictatesâ [Drawing Ismene towards her seat. Hear again! ISMENE. Unhand meârebel son! Assembled Chiefs, Ye called meâI have spoken onceâI speak No more; make way there!âI must pass alone! [Exit Ismene. THOAS. [Calling to Ismene. O! mother, stay! She's gone. [Sinks into his chair. IPHITUS. Her word decides, Unless the gods disown it. Peace! the altar Is silent; the last moment presses on usâ Hyllus, the doom'd, stand forth! CREUSA. O pause; to thee Thoas, I call; thou know'st him guiltless. IPHITUS. Hold! No mortal passion can have utterance here, When Fate is audible. To yield is ours; Be calm as Hyllus, or forego his hand. [Creusa sinks on her knees beside Hyllus; Iphitus lays one hand on the head of Hyllus, and raises the other towards heaven. IPHITUS. Dread Power, that bade us to this fane, accept The expiation that we offer now, And let this blood poured forth atone. [Thoas suddenly falls from his seat to the ground Creusa rushes to him, and all surround him. CREUSA. Gods! what is this new horror? [Opening the vest of Thoas, the dagger falls from it. THOAS. There! 'Tis done! 'Tis well accomplish'd. CREUSA. Hyllus, go! Brother, no moreâfor thee he perishes. THOAS. I will not purchase a last taste of sweetness By such estrangement. That steel bears the blood Of Creon and his slayer;âhow excus'd I leave you, generous king, to witness for me. Enter Calchas. CALCHAS. The queen! THOAS. Hold life a momentâwhat of her? CALCHAS. She rush'd, With looks none dared to question, to the cave; Paused at its horrid portal; toss'd her arms Wildly abroad; then drew them to her breast, As if she clasp'd a vision'd infant there; And as her eye, uplifted to the crag, Met those who might prevent her course, withdrew Her backward step amidst the deadly clouds Which veil'd herâtill the spectral shape was lost, Where none dare ever tread to seek for that Which was Ismene. THOAS. Peace be with her! Pentheus, Thy hand;âlet Hyllus reign in honour here;â Convey me to the city of my love; Her future years of glory stream more clear Than ever on my soul. O Athens! Athens! [Dies. HYLLUS. Sister! CREUSA. Forgive me, brother. [Falls on the neck of Hyllus. HYLLUS. Weep there; 'tis thy home. Fate, that has smitten us so young, leaves thisâ That we shall cleave together to the grave. THE CURTAIN FALLS. THE END.</field>
