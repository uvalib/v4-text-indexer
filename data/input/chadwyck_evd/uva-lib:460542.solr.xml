      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE A laboratory in the royal palace at Dublin. It is so dusk that the various objects are only seen as shades of deeper darkness. Queen Iseult looms beside an alembic in the foreground. Brangaena kneels further back adjusting flax on a spindle. Queen. Where art thou? Brangaena. Here. Queen. The Love-Charm is combined! It waits to live. Brangaena. Before the incantation, Tell me for whom I gathered on the hills The maddening colt's-foot that the mares and stallions Wrench from the dust to feed their rushing flames; For whom, on the sea-shore, sea-holly's root? Queen. My child, who, loses all, shall lose not love, Or she will walk the earth of men a shade; A shade is woman if she may not love, And silent are the deeps from birth to death If love move not with widely ruling stroke The billows of the heart of woman's breast. Brangaena. Great Queen, great wisdom! Queen. Thou shalt pour the wine For Mark of Cornwall and my child Iseult. But, sweet, beware: not even a dew-drop's droplet Must pass thy lips. It is so terrible, The senses were obsequious to one touch, As if to transport. Brangaena. In my careful hands It shall be guarded as within thy hands. Queen. Brangaena, I will plight my child to Love, By deeply working minerals, by juices That thrust the force of Venus through the blades, And fragrant, piercing flower-hearts, or control it In secret tubers. As within my womb I fashioned her for life, so now I fashion Within this marvellous alembic's chalice Her fuller fate, her love's nativity. Draw out thy wheel and twist the double threads; Thou wilt hear music through the air: spin on. [Brangaena sits at the distaff. Queen Iseult touches the vessel with her sceptre. O ancient Love, of Chaos bred From seeding darkness of the void; O link of all the germens spread Through hollow gales by hate deployed, Fuse with a star-pang from the stars, That are thy torches never spent, The faculties within this vase, Each touching each, yet continent. Unite them, till of joy they found A sway like that that holds the earth And sea and fire and ether bound; A sway that is grown old at birth, That is a freshness in the tomb. Oh, sweep like beauty through their tide, And be thy benison the doom That never more they shall divide! [Two star-rays fall on the alembic and ignite it, filling the chamber with soft light. A long, wailing strain of music rends the air; then a fanfare is heard; and the long, wailing strain of music dies on the air. Hold firm the twisted threads; bring me a flask. [She pours from the alembic. See, how this nectar plunges kiss in kiss; Smell how the breath of it is like a land's Where all the groves of trees are florulent. Swift, I must close it! Twine the double threads About the vial's neck. This little crystal Can laugh Pandora's chest to ridicule, For joy as well as sorrow is within, Necessity that puts out feeble hope, The lightning that Jove brought with him to bed When he came godlike upon Semele, The currents that for ever wash the steps Of Ocean's palace-cave, two horoscopes, And the great motion Life, the calm of Death, With marriage of all these till Love shall end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I An early spring morning on the sea. The ship of Tristan is moored by the coast of Wales: the sailors are gone ashore. The stern of the ship is higher than the head, so that the deck slopes toward the hidden head. Immediately in front is the mainmast and the door of the cabin. Tristan, with his back turned, leans against the helm, his arm over the wheel. His form is seen against the light green hills of the coast. Once or twice he whistles bird-notesâthen keeps silence. A few Little Maidens are playing amid the tackle on the foremost part of the deck. Tristan, roused by their cries and laughter, turns and watches them. 1. Little Maiden. Catch me, if you can, O Hoodman, blind as buzzard. 2. Little Maiden. As mole or bat or beetle. 4. Little Maiden. Or as the blinkard owl. Lo and behold me here! 1. Little Maiden. Look and observe our ambush! Who put your eyes out, Hoodman? 2. Little Maiden. Away! 1. Little Maiden. Away! 4. Little Maiden. Away! [They rush off with screams of merriment to starboard. [Iseult enters from the cabin, coming up the steps. She stands fronting the head-sea and her country left behind. Iseult. Would I might lie down on my Irish shore, Dead on my shore! [She falls on the deck. [Tristan draws near and stretches one of the idle sails out to shadow Iseult; then he paces a little distance from her. [Unheeding. Cursed be the sea! [Tristan comes up softly, and says in a low voice, as if to himself. Tristan. He loved me from the sea; I was an orphan, A cast-away, a wandering child; He loved me from the sea, as his own sonâ [Iseult raises her head. I looked on you In Ireland, when your Mother bore me in As a sick wandering harper from the sea . . . Iseult (rising). My Mother, very dark shall be her sunset! Tristan (fixing his eyes on her and continuing steadily). And when I left the dream was in my heart To sing your beauty to the only mortal Worthy of men to hear. Not Tantris' harpâ Tristan'sâwith fame that rustles through the world, Sang to King Mark of Cornwall, my liege-lordâ Iseult is fair; there is no woman's child So fair to look upon. Aurora's daughter and her child, fair Helen, Are rumoured fair, as if all beauty Were gathered up in them as in two flowers. O King, such idleness Thou shalt no more believe! The sun of beauty Dawned not in Greece! 'Tis risen in our day, In Ireland, where the sun, born of the dawning, Iseult, the daughter of Iseult, shines down, Gladdening all creatures, giving fame to all; For so her beauty is diffused, through her All women in her brightness are shown bright. [Iseult sinks on the gunwale. Queen, you are faint . . . these days you have not eaten Nor drunk! . . . And it is hot within the sun, Burning down on us in his noonâyou parched. Maidens (turning), a flask of wine, a cup! 1. Little Maiden. Where find them? 2. Little Maiden. Here is a cup the helmsman threw away Before he left the ship. [She gives it to Tristan. 3. Little Maiden. Brangaena set A flask of wine above her bed. 1. Little Maiden. Then fetch it. [Exit one of the Little Maidens. [Tristan and Iseult stand silent. The other Maidens clustered at a distance chat in clear voices. 1. Little Maiden. Look, Nessa, The pebbles and the sand within the green Of this still harbour are as white as flour Upon a miller's stones. 2. Little Maiden. And all at once The sea-mews dive. 3. Little Maiden. And how the seamen laugh Around the little boat that bore Brangaena. I wonder what she buys for us. 1. Little Maiden. She landed To sit upon the grass again, to wander Along the seaward banks of primroses, And smell soft breathings through the salt. 3. Little Maiden. O Nessa, Can you not smell the primroses? I can. [The Maiden returns with Brangaena's flask: she gives it to Tristan and runs to join her fellows, who have begun a new game round the wheel. Tristan (pouring). And you will touch the wine-cup with your lips? Iseult. No, I will drink the wine . . . [She stretches out her hand, half fainting, for the cup, and as she drinks gazes at him over the brim. As sweet as hydromel and bergamot: How exquisite a fume! [She drinks no more and hands the cup to him. Tristan, the wine! . . . Tristan (as the empty cup falls from his hand). But you are beautiful! But you are very beautiful! [He turns and moves away down the vessel. Iseult. Not gone? Tristan! Tristan (returning). You calledâ Iseult. The wine! It covers me like death. [Iseult faints. Tristan. She stirs her lids, Her lips; the little movements gall me, pester Till I could cast her from me. Yet so warm A fervour mantles through me from her breath, A solace that forbids me to be lone And inauspicious any more. Iseult! I cannot love her. Ah, what have I thought! Almost I am his son, and she . . . almost she is his wife. [Iseult moves. I cannot meet her eyes; there must be silence Between our eyes or there is nothing left To give or take. Iseult. How lovely is the light, And a white sea-bird sails across. . . . [She lies looking up; a slow smile spreads over her face: she keeps looking up for a little while; then she closes her eyes. What darkness! [Suddenly she opens her eyes on Tristan. My life, my death! [They kiss. No, opening flowers. . . . It has no name . . . far off As Africa. I think it is the magic My mother knows. Why do you vex yourself? Tristan. But I have wandered So far I never more shall find the path. Iseult. There are no paths marked out before. Beloved, The way is where we tread. There are no ways For the arrow and the stars. [Cry of the Little Maidens as they rush from the seaward side of the vessel to the landward. All. Brangaena comes. 1. Little Maiden. Her bosom full of primroses. 2. Little Maiden. Brangaena! [She gradually appears up the side of the vessel. As she steps on board she sees Tristan and Iseult. The primroses drop on the deck. Voice of Sailor (below). Heigh there, be quick! 1. Little Maiden. We shall be rowed ashore! The salt grass must be lit with primroses, And dances on about the hostelry. Joy! 2. Little Maiden. You are white, Brangaena, as a ghost. [She waves them away. They get down with cries and laughter. Brangaena. âBut she is in his bosom; But they are lovers, and King Mark abused . . . The flask! . . . Iseult, Iseult! She lifts her head and smiles. O royal mother, Whose prayers pursue our sailing! . . . [Coming close. Woe is me, Sir Tristan, at this sight. Tristan. I have no sorrow, No shame to call upon. The whirr of pinions, Strong as the elements, is all I hear When mortal voice condemns me. Brangaena. O betrayed, I do not speak your condemnation; never May I accuse . . . Tristan. Brangaena, Death could not part us! Is there anything, O God Thyself, could part us? Brangaena. There is nothing. [She turns away and stands on the scatter of primroses. This empty vessel let the cloistering sea Shut up for ever! . . . [She throws the goblet to the waves. Sunken, and for ever. Scene II The next morning. On the coast of Cornwall the Castle of Tintagel can be seen from the ship Iseult and Brangaena Iseult. What shall I do? The ship is steering fast; And all that frown of moonlight on the stream! The ship is sailing. Yonder, see, the land That will engulf me. Brangaena. You are sick for sleep. It is the sea engulfs. Iseult. If I could plunge Back in the sea! I know the magic call, Would bring the great wave Cleena, in a rush, To plight me back again to my own land! O Erin, Erin! Brangaena. Tell me, royal heart, What is your grief, for if there be a way To lighten or remove it. . . . Iseult. Ah, you love! Brangaena, I have passed my bridal-night. How great the dawn is! I would be alone, And watch the birds: but Tristan and his men Prepare a litter that shall carry me There, up that awful fastness, to King Mark. Brangaena. If I can serve Iseult, Iseult's Iseult. . . . Enter Kurvenal Kurvenal. Sir Tristan prays That you put on your royal robes. [He bows and retires. Iseult. Brangaena! Brangaena (kissing her). Beloved, the darkness of your wedding night Be mine, the shame. Give me the royal robes. [She wraps Iseult in them. Tristan is seen advancing; Iseult moves toward him. For any man would gladly die for her: I can do more. And all that we can do, No matter what its name of infamy, Is to be done, that in this checking world Some may be free and proud. How steep a coast! Scene III Tintagel. King Mark's bridal chamber; it has darkened windows. The chime rings out three o'clock. Voice of Mark. Wine. . . . Voice of Brangaena. I will bid them bring the bridal-cup, As is the custom. Voice of Mark. O warm voice, that settles Down on my heart a dove! Iseult, I thank Thy modesty that made our marriage-night Dark as the gulf from which our lives were drawn. Thou hast brought round me the abyss again, And I am new created. She is gone. Iseult, Iseult, Iseult! Where art thou? Only in thy arms, Only against thy lips I dare descend Unsealed infinitude. My own, come back! Voice of Iseult. But I am here. Voice of Mark. You vanished, and the marvel Began of very darkness in eclipse. Voice of Iseult. The bridal-cup. [Enter Tristan with torch and wine-cup. Iseult is seen, amid her golden hair, sitting by Mark, who has risen from his couch. Mark. My Tristan . . . but how ghostly, And trembling! Ah, it is a new-wrought valour That must reveal itself beneath the flambeau Of awful Love. You quail. . . . May Heaven exalt you One day secure beneath that noble sanction That casts out fear. Tristan, those tides of blood, That stain you like the wine-cup in your hand, Will rush then undismayed. Tristan (to Iseult). The gobletâdrink! Iseult. Your nephew blunders. No, Sir Tristan. Mark. Dearest, Your lips must touch the wine. Henceforth your beauty Touches all acts and modes that had before No gist, nor any matter. Iseult. Let me drink. It is unseasoned wine? Mark. From Italy; The Emperor's gift. Iseult. Pure vintage! (She drinks.) To my lord, My husband. [She passes the cup to him. Mark. O Iseult, to thee, to thee! My soul's soul, O my bride! Henceforth I shall approach you, think of you With such devotion as I give my God; You are the thing divine in all our earth I love or ever can. [He drinks. Iseult. Now, of your kindness, Let me withdraw myself among my women. Mark. By the great Queen of Love, my queen can rule Her time, her favour, everything. Look, Tristan. Our queen sweeps back a train of tresses: surely They were not thus unbound a while ago. Iseult. I let them loose to hail you, when the torch-light Should cover me, for I would be all golden A queen's first morning. Mark. Child, thy voice is proud, Imperious, not the voice that sank on me But lately in the darkness, like a dove. Iseult, thy beauty is so vehement, I would the dark still hid it from my eyes: They are too humble to receive it, seeing Its prodigy. A kiss for our first dawn! What, cold as dawn? I shall believe the night Glows with the hidden sun, That chills at sunrise. There, Iseult, go forth To thy own chamber, if thou wilt, and leave me! The day I knew my crown was more familiar To my belief than this of thy submission Toward one who worships from so far away. [She stumbles against the wine-cup he has thrown down. Iseult. The cup! [She takes it up and laughs. On board your ship I saw a woman Take such a cup as this and throw it forth To seas submerged beneath the sea. (To Tristan.) You saw it Inclosed where none can stretch? [Exit. Mark (to Tristan). Am I not happy? I am, I am! [The King draws Tristan, who kneels, into his arms. Beloved, how strange to think You, in your youth, by mad adventure, won me This eminence to have her as my wife. My full, undreamed perfection thou didst dream For me, so long austere and unimpassioned I could not even imagine destiny As you were bent to flush it on my years. I cannot give you thanksânay, but thanksgiving, As if you were not mortal. O Beloved, In this, that thou hast wrought no heaviness Must fall on thee. Thou must not doubt my love, Because I love so well the guest thou drewest Beside my heart's fire. We are ever fast. And if I have no child thou art my heir [Tristan makes a rejecting movement. To Cornwall and to Ireland. Tristanânay! How have I hurt thee? Thou art jealous, see'st Thy kingdoms put in danger by espousals God grant may never injure thee? O Tristan, My joy has privilege That none should sorrow near it. Tristan. There have been But you and I together . . . Mark, forgive! Mark. I cannot sing as youâI love all music; And you have ever drawn to unison My moods and your avouchment of my moods. You know I love you, Tristan. Do not fail me, Nor contravene your work. Tristan (freeing himself from Mark's arms). How dare I ask you To pardon? It is destinedâmy offence . . . For all is harsh in this new intercourse; And you have found I am o'er-taken jealous. We were together, you and I; we trusted The loyalty of every hour we breathed That nothing was between us through all time. Show me a little grace. . . . The twilight comes That will be day: the torch is spent. . . . I weary. Dismiss me from your presence! Mark. With no word Of salutation from my only friend; No kiss from my most-loved through many years? Tristan (with a cry). Mark! [He suddenly and coldly goes to take up the flambeau. Mark. Nay, but, Tristan, this is graveâmost cruel, Unjust; for you have changed my life, not I. Yet it is changed. A mighty tide is setting Against its common stream, of such invasion And roll of flood, your doubt of me, your discord Are swept as nothing to the wilderness Of the thronged currents, with their scurf of speed, As I have seen at efflux of the waters: Even such predominance of change hath happened Beyond the power of you, even you, to check. Let in the day! Your thoughts are strange, perverse. Sleep! You will own me in your heart again. Tristan. God bless the king! Mark. O Tristan, leave me! Tristan (as if to himself, taking the torch). Almost Burnt out to ashâgone out. Mark. I will let in The day. Go to your couch. [The light of the torch drops. Tristan. The flame is dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I An ante-room in the Castle of Tintagel, with steps leading up to the Presence-Chamber, shut from sight by heavy, purple curtains. Groups of Noblemen, among them Marjodo, converse and are joined by others from time to time. Melot sits on the steps reading. 1. Nobleman. At last the revels end! 2. Nobleman. Our Queen disordered The daily ceremonial: to-day We give Time all his customary dues, And hour by hour his age's privilege. 1. Nobleman. Is it the Queen? Marjodo. I scarcely think it is: She gives such generous changes to the blood; Her laughter is as little summer gales. She alters us As April altersâ'Tis her coming hither. 3. Nobleman. If I may speak, this Queen is full of peril. 4. Nobleman. Well saidâyour wisdom, of your years. Marjodo. Ha, ha! 1. Nobleman. It is Sir Tristan's coming. Young Nobleman (to Melot). Aquitaine, What is it? Tell us! Melot (glancing from the page of his small book). Our great pelicans Have fled the haunt they lorded 'mid the fowls. It is the reason of their flight. Old Nobleman. Your wisdom! Well, you are short of stature; and beside No gossip! But the wind, my lords, I hear Was rough and opposite . . . there is a whisper They put to shore and in a primrose-wood Tarried one starlit evening. Marjodo. Hist! Sir Tristan! [They all grow silent. Tristan is about to fall into one of the groups silentlyâthen he starts and looks round. Tristan. What do I interrupt, what colloquy? There is no need for silence when I enter, For nothing Cornwall's nobles can discuss Could be of languid interest to my ear. Melot. We glorify the Queen. Tristan. How natural! Until those curtains may be drawn aside And all the heaven Of her full beauty shine on us. 1. Nobleman. Devout! 2. Nobleman (on the outside of the group round Tristan). But lookâsome angry apparition chides. Enter Iseult by side-door Iseult. Tell me, fair noblesâI am much perplexed By the dark-thridding stairways of this strange, Enchanted castle. . . . I have found myself Almost within the dungeons. . . . Urgently I seek Sir Tristan. Marjodo (turning). In the dungeons, lady? Iseult. Oh, everywhere! I am quite wearied out. 1. Nobleman. Have patience, madam; we are waiting here To do you homage. Marjodo. Is it secret-sweet The reason of your search? Breathe it to me, And word for word. . . . Tristan (parting the crowd round him). My Queen, your kinswoman Must be reproved for this. 2. Nobleman. Ho, ho, his charge, Confided to Brangaena, and she slips! But she is lovely now, not veiled in purple, Not deeply hooded. Take our homage, Queen, To you alone, here standing in our midst. Your pleasure shall in all be ours. [Turning their backs to the Presence-Chamber, they all kneel to Iseult. Iseult. Sir Tristan, How ill it is these nobles are not slaves; Then we had taught them manners. But, Sir Tristan, You do me wrong: it is not yet the hour, Though close upon the hour, Brangaena sets The crown upon my head. I sought you simply To choose our music at the feast to-night. Marjodo bade me choose it, and I could not; Marjodo bade me to consult the king, I would not, knowing you are all to him, Attuning all his lays. Tristan. That now is changed. My harp will have but little use; the king In you has harmony so far more wondrous Than I can weave into his dreams. I thank you For your great courtesy. All that the throne Commands me I obey. Marjodo, take The Queen back to her chamber. Iseult (to the nobles). Keep your knees. You have wrought much offence. Pardon, Sir Tristan; My royal Irish manners are too plain For this small, ceremonious land. But later, When we are Queen, ourselves will breathe the rule. Marjodo! [Exit with Marjodo. Nobles (to Tristan). May we rise? 2. Nobleman. Are you appointed The Queen's new seneschal? 4. Nobleman. My lords, you see We are sold back to Ireland. Tristan. If enslaved, Enslaved to Beauty. Pass before your king. At noon, in full assembly, he proposes To read to you, his vassals, from his throne, By how sure titles I have won you Ireland. The curtains open: pass before your king. [Mark and Iseult are seen on their thrones, Marjodo and Brangaena in attendance. 1. Nobleman (to Tristan). Then you are not a courtier? Tristan. To your duty! Pass, pass! [The Nobles enter the Presence-Chamber ceremoniously. The great purple curtains fall together. O infinite, great Powers, O Light Of Heaven, save her! She has struck among us As fatal as a goddess. That Marjodo Has a sleek eye; he taunted me this morning, Said he had tracked my steps: I thwarted him; But as the fury rushed up to her face Concentred on his visage, I took note He twitched and writhed aside. Has he betrayed? My bed-fellow, my early friend, my trusted, But not quite trusted, friend; my little rival, My imitator, and, in every wrangle, Jealous, back-biting foe. Iseult, I dreamed Of drawing you away, of roving far Across the seas: but you are framed a Queen, And must be as the terrible white sapphire Before your people. All my sanctity Shall be to hold you white upon your throne. Iseult! [He sits on a bench at the side, with head bowed on his hands. The great curtains of the Presence-Chamber are swept apart by King Mark. He drops them and stands before them as they close. Mark. Tristan, look up. Away from me, away. Tristan, a breath Of evil rumour has come near the Queen; A buzz is in the crowd. There are no weapons But prayer and vigilance. Tristan, no more You may attend the Queen. We must protect Her senses from this slander; eye and ear Will soil, if she suspect that any brain Conceives of her save as an angel moving Among us. You attend the Queen no more. Melot will serve her. Tristan. Mark, the infamy You fix on me! Do you not feel the blow? [Mark turns sharply away: the purple curtains fall behind him. Scene II Tintagel. The Queen's chamber. At the back a door, wide open, gives on a little stream that runs past. Brangaena is sitting with Iseult in her lap. Iseult's hair is shed round her. Iseult. I am so weary; but what rest I find With thee! Brangaena, I have heavenly news, Tidings, how wonderful! There are No tidings I can give thee for thyself: There thou art like a mother, blessÃ¨d one. [Patting Brangaena's cheeks. My news! King Mark is going from his court, Is going, for seven days, on pilgrimage. That is to me as if he said to-morrow Winter is dead, to-morrow The plague, the sickness of my days have end. Tristan is sickâno matter!âfor they leave him Safe at Tintagel, and my touch can heal. I shall not see him, as for weary weeks, In state, while I have bent from clustered sapphires Of mordant black, down from my throne, my ermine, My majesty above him, as a goddess His eyes are dreams ofâhis unbearable, Gold eyes. . . . My triumph! Now I shall be mortal, And he my god. Why do you pale? O blessÃ¨d, Love guards us: we are following some law As irresistible as when through havoc Of flames and raid the orchard-trees come out, And smile on all the world. Enter Mark Mark. There is a rumour, My Queen, that thou art sick. Our fair Brangaena Lacks in no service? Iseult. Press your hand across My forehead; do not speak to me. Mark. Most precious To tend you thus! Iseult. It soothes me. Mark. Sweet, I come To bid farewell, come unexpectedly, The hour forgotten. Iseult. Look for no farewell. You are deserting me, or for a hunt, Or God, it makes no matter. [With closed eyes. Mark, my husband, You should be gentle to me, for at whiles I mourn for my own country, and a madness Comes over me so bitter in its strength I fain would die. You did not woo me, Mark; I missed your wooing. Mark. But I never take The least caress save as you give me leave. I am your lover, and you free, Iseult; [Suddenly binding her wrist with his hand. Though the least freedom you should take, Iseult, Iseult, would plunge me Into sheer hell: that is your liberty. [She sways, and he draws her to his breast. Brangaena, keep all noise from her. Iseult (opening her eyes and springing to her feet). Deserted! Go, I will ask no reason: then at least Ask thou no reason, but give ear with speed To my request: leave me not in the power, Not for a day, an instant, of Sir Tristan. Mark (bending to look in her eyes). He has offended thee? Iseult. Let him be absent Long as my lord is absent! Mark. If it please you, When I return I will send Tristan back To his own land, to Parmenie. Iseult. Oh, has he A country of his own, and is it far? How good to have a country one may hide in, When one is bitter chidden of one's Queen And hated! Mark. Dearest! Iseult. Banish him, forsake meâ What will your life be, Sire, without us twain? Mark. A desert. I am going to a desert . . . I told you. Iseult. Sire, why will you go away? Why will you draw This misery upon us? Mark (scrutinising her as she kneels). For my peace. [Exit. Iseult. He loves me as a mortal in the talons Of Jove's own bird; he plants the grip of love; None could remove his passion, naught in the world. Divert its set toward me, its jealousy. [Arrested by Brangaena, who has not moved since she kept her eyes fixed in terror on King Mark. You stand white-faced before me and you tremble . . . I am gone mad! He praises you, your voiceâ Brangaena (rousing herself). Hush! I must braid your hair. Iseult. Let it alone! The king looks long on it. Brangaena. It must be twisted Thus, with your crown. Iseult (looking into Brangaena's eyes, as she twists her hair). You take authority? Brangaena. To braid your hair as queens must weave their braids. Iseult. So chill and distant! If you will not speak, If we no more are sisters, but divided . . . Tristan read to me of the placid queen, Great Junoâsoftly she leaned up against The thunder-bolts, a female Jupiter: Yet in the Latin there were many fables Of how she could not brook through all the heavens That any woman should have eyes of Jove To bathe her eyes in. So I am a Queen. O Citheronia, they have not known me, Nor am I come to strength! Brangaena. By my soul's saving, Of the love-philtre not a dew-drop's droplet Has touched my lips. Iseult. But you have stately motions, A royal carriage. You at least I banish. Go, fetch me Melot here! Brangaena. Iseult! Iseult. Fetch Melot. [Exit Brangaena. O little stream, Flowing around my chamber, flowing, flowing, And never taking heed, how good to watch The catkins as they tumble in the waves; To see them lift and drop and float away And be forgotten. How I love the tides, And ebb and flow, and variable winds, That carry through their storms and rock to peace. [Perceiving Melot, who has entered quietly. O Melot, are you there? You are a dwarf; 'Tis terrible to face you; and you see To the bottom of my heart. You read the stars: You read them; they are silent. Though you speak No word to me, I lie Under your searching quiet, as the lambs Lie under moonlight. Melot, succour me! Melot. I come, with numbered and fore-trodden steps, To you, a dwarf who frightens you, as all Initiation frightens. . . . In the dark I saw Brangaena leave your bridegroom's chamber, Saw you and Tristan spill the bridal-wine On the way thither as the morning flushed. Iseult. Then it were good indeed that she were dead! Death is so quiet. Melot. Death is noisiest Of all the elements and will not rest Until it draw the living to its lips. Brangaena offered me her life next day, And I refused it, when her lips had proved Their rank for ever. It is not the deedsâ But gossip of the deeds, of deeds ne'er done, That makes the earth infectious. I have sworn To guard your secret: blow your sin about, And all my oaths are sunk. Be circumspect! [Throwing herself at Melot's feet. Iseult. Melot, in all the world I love Sir Tristan: he is all I am. Melot. Nay, you are moreâa Queen. There are two paths For every soul the limitless, great stars Deign to brood over in their energy To keep the rhythm of: they thread the crowd, And, for the rest, attune, attune, attune. Iseult. But I have murdered my own heart, and all Its crying death is in me. Melot, Melot, My madnessâfor I bade the king myself Exile Sir Tristan, far as he can exile, To Parmenie, or where The world drops in the sea. Now I must perish Of my own violence . . . except . . . I know not . . . You stand up in my chamber, as if sent And interposing. Give me sight of him!â You are a sorcererâI ask not how, Nor what shall happen, nor the consequence. I must see Tristan, as the day must dawn, As the stars must break through. Melot. O rigorous! You know but one inevitable thing, One moving power: so chaos in its atoms Conceived the void, till one More subtle and elusive shape prevailed, And by persuasive ritual fell aside, Parted the elements and gave them paths. [Advancing nearer. You must sway Tristan, and in Love's own name; In Love's own name, too, you must sway King Mark: It is inevitable to your husband To love: he has a god's content in you. Keep these inevitable loves from clash, Unless you are a woman-fiend and care But for the dance of chaos. Will you perishâ You, Tristan, Cornwall? You can wreck the kingdom! Or will you learn of me the circumspection, And the wide glance that takes account of all? Iseult. What would you have me do? Melot. It is his patience Alone that builds and constitutes a god; But you are playing A victim's part, for you are irreligious, And so the victim of your destiny. Iseult. I will learn of you; I will heed your counsel. Melot. Pass through the orchard to your lover, pass, For seven nights, and on the eighth desist: I will provide you meet in secrecy. When the king comes back from his pilgrimage, Hungered from fast, be loyal to his peace. Farewell. [Exit Melot. Iseult. I feel as some divinity Hove into sight. Tristan is gay, is sadâ I only thought of loving him, and not Of keeping all the elements in poise. [She sighs deeply. The orchard! And he said to-night, And seven nights . . . [Closing her eyes. The rest is sky, is air, Is immaterial. There are all the worlds! Scene III An orchard in moonlight Mark and Marjodo enter stealthily. Marjodo climbs one of the apple-trees Marjodo. Sire, it is here we spy. Mark. Here that we watch. Marjodo. In moonlight As clear as this? Sire, we shall be surprised. Mark. What could the moon look down on of so vile As a king hiding stealthy in the dark? It is the deadliest sin. But whence that rain? The flower-leaves of the orchard showering down In moonlit bevies from each shaken branch? . . . Marjodo. Hist, hist! Climb quick! Mark. I am built deep in night, And but in peril as the guilty are. [Perceiving Iseult at a distance. O sweet-paced steps! I will learn of her why so guilelessly She thrids the orchard. . . . [Iseult starts, perceiving the shadows of Mark and Marjodo thrown by the moon behind them. Iseult. Holy Trinity, Threefold of Love, protect me! Mark. She is moved, Even as I; something she apprehends, Yet simply and with prayer more confident Than I have ever lifted to my God Waits the event. Marjodo. Look yonder! (pointing to Tristan). [Tristan perceives the shadows and stops: Iseult draws slightly back. Mark. Tristan! So I paused before The mortal Venus when I saw her first. I cannot see her: in his face I see . . . Oh, push the boughs aside! Tristan (advancing). How should I speak? Iseult. Speak not, there is no need. Sir Tristan, I was come to chide with you. O ghost, O misery, so wan thou art, So haggard and unfriendly in thy motions, Thou frightest me. How should I chide with death? Tristan. Chiding! Peace, peace! I cannot suffer chiding 'twixt us twain. Only receive my prayerâI have a prayer, That you must make. . . . I would not curse my king, For I am dying, for he is thy lord . . . But pray him, thou, Fair morning sun of thy fair mother's dawn, Stricken of him to devastate the heavens, And cast a thwarting light upon the earth, Pray him have patience with me, give me leave To tarry on my bed a little while: I am too sick to journey. I should die As unespied and secret as the birds That leave a little voidness in the woods, And have no funeral. Iseult (steadying herself against a tree-trunk). Remember this, Sir Tristan, it is I that banished you. I am so jealous, I had slain Brangaenaâ He praised her; and from me you take your death. Tristan. You will live on, trample the slander out. Iseult (turning resolutely away). I shall live on and very slowly die. [She disappears. Tristan (treading on Mark's shadow). Would I were dead or he! [Exit. Mark. Go hence, Marjodo; Deceiver, hence, before my tears are hot As Iceland's fountains. Marjodo. If I were mistaken . . . Mark. Go hence, Marjodo. Leave me! [Exit Marjodo. O my God, I am no more Thy hermit, if my wife Is jealous of me; and for me she lets That lovely knighthood fall into the dust. She is gone back alone to her lone bed, Her tears, her jealousy. O Moon, you saw, You saw that she was chaste; but better far, Dearer, of more account, in accusation Confounding me, and yet more infinite In solace to my heartâthat she is jealous! Scene IV Tintagel. The Queen's Chamber Iseult is looking forth toward the shrine of St. Neot's Enter Mark Mark. Not there, Iseult! The pilgrim is returned, peace in his heart. How hast thou passed the time? Iseult (turning). In idleness, Undeserved sorrow. Mark. BlessÃ¨d be the grief That gives me sight at last of dropping tears. You came to me fore-fated as my Queen, Passive and even-eyed . . . I find you sorrowful, I find you watching even as a wife Is sorrowful and watches. O Beloved! [He takes her hand. Still speechless in your welcome, still resentful! Iseult, you cannot know the awful worship Your husband has in hoard for you. My pearl, Found flawless, inconceivable the joy, The dazzled avarice of possessing you. Iseult. My lord, I have a suit. Mark. No suit, Iseult. For thyself freedom; for me ignorance In all thy pleasure. Give me now such news, Such confidences as your prompting heart Craves to disburthen. Iseult. Tristan is fallen sick. The suit I have from him Is that you give him grace for seven days To gather strength, and afterwards to leave The court, the land for ever, no suspicion Clouding your honour. This he prays for both. Mark (withdrawing his hand). Tristan is innocent. Let there be peace between us! [He speaks to Melot at the door, then returns to the Queen. Iseult. There is more, A suit that is my own. You have put peril Between me and Sir Tristan, names, imaginings He cannot bear for me, nor I for him. I love your knight . . . and I would take my love Back to my mother, to the Queen Iseult. [She weeps. Mark. If these are lovers, And would not wrong me, but are doomed to love! So at the shrine My heart was softened, so as in a vision One instant I beheld. Enter Tristan; he has his bow and quiver. He advances to Mark See, Tristan, see! I have so wronged her that she prays for exile For ever from me. Tristan. Sire, you are confused; I pray for exile. Mark. All men flee from me! Why do you pray for exile? Tristan. You have fixed At last suspicion on her. Mark (after a long, remorseful gaze on Iseult). Tristan, Tristan, The wrong that I have done you is but littleâ The jest, the tragedy 'twixt man and man: I have been jealous. Tristan, take the charge Of the Queen's chamber, be her constant guardian, Among the courtiers be her constant courtier, Win her again to pardon me. Remain! For I indeed must pass to solitude; I have done outrage to the common air, And know not what the gods will do with me. [Exit Mark. [Iseult rises and turns with lightning-like rapidity to Melot. Melot. I watch no more. But, Queen, be circumspect! [Exit. [As Iseult passes Tristan, her robe brushes against him: suddenly he catches her to his arms. Iseult. Oh, give me speech, Beloved . . . at least your eyes! I cannot bear The blackness of this ecstasy. Oh, let me Look on youâstill the russet hair, and all The rest sunk into winter. Dear, dear winter, Grown wintry for Iseult. Where hast thou been, These days, these nights We have not been together? Speak to me! Have you been dying? Tristan (shudders). With the shadows. Oh, Speak not; I heard thee in the orchard speak. Scan me not; in the orchard thou didst scan. Give thyself to me! Iseult (she caresses him, puts her arm round him, and whispers). Seven nights, beloved, He promised us; the first we were betrayed; The first will be to-night. Tristan. Then day be night! Oh, how I suffer, when by day and night For days and nights we are but to ourselves, Not to each other; and the sun goes out Sighing, and eve is as a farewell groan. Give thyself to me now. Iseult (laying her head on Tristan's bosom). Be merciful, And comfort me. Was not my wit a lanthorn Thrown on the shadows? And the dwarf . . . Beloved, You must praise Melot, who so tenderly Contracts us, who has promised us seven nights, To-night the first. Tristan. I bid you trust not Melot. Brangaenaâ Iseult. Ho! Name not Brangaena; thou hast kissed her cheek; She told me, and I slapped it. Tristan. For her service I kissed her, for her great fidelity. Iseult. There is no more Brangaena! But this dwarf, Who is no dwarf, Melot the sorcerer, The something like a whisper in one's speech, The smallness of a creature made so fine, Of such gold-dust and deep-welled gems, the bulk Cannot, with all the worlds to make, be large, He serves me: I must kiss him on the cheek For his fidelity. Tristan. O breaking smile! Do anything you will. Iseult. I shall keep Melot. Tristan. To see you smile! Would we were simple lovers! Could you but shine upon me, and, rejoiced, The world take light about us, as when lovers Are seen and watched and passed with kindness by. Iseult, it is our curse, We cannot live through the sweet daylight hours With kisses, little moments of offence, Misgivings and delights of wrangling love. We cannot; therefore we must wipe away The memory of those blinking moonlit trees, The stalking-horse, the unreality. Give me thyself, let me breathe warm again; Give me thy sighs to lay upon my heart, Now in the noon, the sun at blaze on us, The friendly sun. . . . God's grace, another shadow! [He points to the form of Marjodo thrown on a piece of linen veiling the window. Iseult points to his bow and fixes the arrow when the bow is brought. Tristan shoots, and the long arrow passes whistling through the Shadow's head. Iseult (looking forth). Triumph! The slandering face is stiffened. Bring me, Love, in a wallet, these marauding heads. My hunter! (Embracing him.) Swift, give him swift burial. Say, do I love thee fierce or in a dream? [Tristan lets himself stealthily down from the window, watched by Iseult. Scene V Wild, marish country beyond the orchard Melot is laying the last spadefuls of earth on Marjodo's body Tristan stands by with a torch Melot. Your lamentations will raise up the ghosts. Tristan. He has been faithful to his king; in duty Confided his suspicions. Melot. If this fen Were a wide burial for his kind, the earth Would very soon give hint of paradise. (Stamping more vigorously.) Were the earth cleared of these, The slandering, inventive, slippery tonguesâ No need of other remedyâI tell you (And the stars oft have dropped their dew on me), That very soon, as in a toward spring, A freshness would draw on across the earth: There would be no more plague, but natural Afflictions, sorrow; at last, balmy death. Tristan. I should be buried by his side. Melot. Sir Tristan, Go to your lady's side; there is your place. The grave is not for lovers. Tristan (going, but looking back at Melot). Curse you, dwarf! Where is your loyalty? [Exit into the orchard. Melot (leaning on his spade and looking up). I serve the stars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I A terrace, approached above from the castle by a central flight of steps, and communicating with an unseen courtyard below by other flights of steps. The Bishop of Thames and Noblemen Bishop. Softly, softly, my lords! Our queen is a very gracious queen; a stranger, but a gracious queen. She is well beloved of the king; so is Melot well beloved of the king and Sir Tristan well beloved of the king. Then, where is the offence? If my sovereign came to meâas often he unbosoms himselfâwith any fear that his gladness and his honour were attainted, I should have patience with your complaining. But the king comes to me always as a very humble penitent, in remorse for his frequent impatience. What is ill with the land? Marjodo has been slain by wild beasts, as who may not be, traversing so wild a country. The king has restored Sir Tristan to favourâand in favour let him remain, till the birth of an heir make the court tedious to him, and he seek fresh adventure. 1. Nobleman. We will not have heirs of his begetting. Bishop. I will not have slanders of your begetting. Go home, my lords; look each one after his own household. 'Tis the hour for my Office. Go! [The lords retire and talk at the top of the left descending flight of stairs. And so fair a woman, even as the holy women of oldâfull of beauty and graciousness, innocent in her husband's eyes and beloved. [Looking round at the autumn birds. It is well, O my soul, thou canst flyâfly away and be at rest with thy God! [He becomes lost in his Office. The lords descend and pass below the terrace. After a while King Mark enters: the Bishop rises and salutes him. Good-morrow, Sire! Mark. O Churchman, There is a marvellous sweet peace upon you. Bishop. I would extend it, for it is God's peace. Nor is it from smooth fountains that this current Flows and makes fruitful: it must well within. Mark. Ay, Holy Writ! God's peace is for the dying, And for the very old. . . . Your punishment For blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? Bishop. Death, and by flame. Mark. . . . My Queen is more indulgent. Oh, I am happy! She absolves so clean She startles me. Bishop. She has a royal gift. [The Priest returns to his Office: King Mark looks out. Tristan comes down the steps and stands behind him. Mark (as he feels Tristan's touch on his shoulder). The birds are settling on our coast in troops, Before they traverse ocean. Look, yon horseman Rides through an empty field; Yet in an instant something of the air Rises from out its sod; black pinions dazzle His horse and the whole sky: another instant There is dead field again. Tristan. I love the autumn, Its air and golden trees that fall away, And pinions borne abroad. Mark. Is it your name That sadly so inclines you? 'Twas a pang When first you told your nameâso glad a child, With branch of linden in your curly hair, Tucked close behind your ears, the blossoms jigging About your forehead, as you taught my men The wood-craft of the Parmenois. My Tristan, I think you are full happy? Tristan. It is joy. Mark. What is? Tristan. This autumn, and once more your favour. Mark. Such verity is in your voiceâI know That verity! Yes, it is good to crackle The crystal oak-leaves in the gritty snow; 'Tis good to watch your fingers that so deftly Uncase, then clean the stag; and good to listen To your ballads by the ingle-nook. Most dearly I love you, sweet inheritor. The bracelet I clasped upon your wrist for your first song You have not worn of late. Tristan. Since I was ill, Yonder in Ireland, it fell forward, tangling My readiness of hand. Mark. King's gifts, king's praises So light with you! Voices (below). Our sovereign! . . . Mark. There is clamour. Listen! 'Tis so we hear ourselves accounted For what we are to subjects. Tristan (flinging himself down on a stone seat away from the parapet). As you choose! A king must take his knowledge as he can. Pray God that I may never be a king, And lose my joy even in the birds afield! Mark moves away to the end of the terrace to the left and listens to the murmur below: after a few minutes he comes back, looks for an instant at Tristan; then goes up straight to the Bishop and seizes his arm. Mark. Listen awhile beside me! Voices (raised maliciously below). We refuse: We will not be the servants of a whore. What did he sayâthis bishop she has caught? Melot is well beloved of the queen, Tristan is well beloved of the queen, The king is well beloved of the queen, And then he laughed . . . a mischief in his eye! But we will not be governed of a whore. Mark. You may not listen: I will stop all ears From such infection. Bishop, this is plague That you must cure. Leash up these rabble-tongues; Threat them with hell; or a wide massacre Will cleanse the purlieus of my palace. Speak! Bishop. Sire, you would go to war with sland'rous tongues? Let be, let be! I will confer with you In private of this matter. Recollect Your ear must not be general. Men live In houses, Sire, not for the warmth, the shelter, But rather to encase themselves With the thick deafness of deep-crusted walls. The day is fair. Sir Tristan mourns his friend; Go, solace him. You took me from my prayers. Mark. I doubt no more; nor will I suffer doubt In any bosom. Not a fiend of hell But in the secret silence of his heart Shall feel her as the blowing, smokeless air He cannot breathe or taint. If you have powerâ Bishop (shaking his head). The tongue can never with the tongue contend: The issue is dissension. Mark. You are helpless! But if you have no power To cleanse my kingdom, then by miracle I will draw down on it the heathen wave That can submerge a country and leave soft, Green fields in chequer on the earth again. I have my instruments, and olden magic Shall speak her pure, if you have nothing by you, No flaming minister, no element, No king that rides the air. Bishop. The Church is full Of every potent magic. Truth is truth, And can avouch itself without a tongue. No heathen waveâ (With sudden energy). There is an element! Your Queen in face of all shall lift her hand Fresh from the hissing iron, free from spot, And God make her acquittal absolute. Mark. The iron! Bishop. Yea, my lord, and not the pyre: That is your mercy; there I must reprove. Mark. Then give my Queen intelligence; assemble My lords about her: but it is the Church I put to proof, if it can silence slander. Tristan (springing forward). Oh, vile to her! The branding iron! Mark, You dare affright her so? Ah, would to God That I had never borne her from her land, Her mother, given this treasure of the world For you to blemish, with your use, your wearing! And would you crack the stone. Mark. If you are heated, You heat for her the iron that will brand. Leave your remonstrance! Tristan. For yourself I plead. Such sin as never she can pardon, such Offence as brands you ever! You will murder Her love for you. Mark. No: prove her love for you Need sing no Miserere. Tristan. So bewildered! Unkingly! Take your titles and be base, The cuckold of the crowd. Mark. Good bishop, open Our counsel to the Queen and bring me word Of her accordance. I await you here. [Exit Bishop. Tristan (pacing violently up and down the terrace). This mummeryâO hell of flame!âfor fire Will burn; there is no miracle to stay it; It shrivels little children in their beds, And sleeping women; it has no remorse. Fire! (Approaching Mark.) Better build a beacon On Cawsand's topmost rocks, there publish her, Stand by and feed the flames! If there be gods Though verily I know notâelements There are and licking airsâif there be gods, Yon deed will be arrested: but go forth, Destroy . . . her that Iseult of Ireland Bore as the gracious dawning bears the sun. O light of the earth, O fair! [Wildly tossing his hands. Mark (who has remained looking toward the central staircase). How dare you doubt Of her, or heaven! Tristan. Would a god suffer it? If it is suffered, if you put your Queen To such intolerable, grave affront, I prayâto those same fiery elements You conjure, to dishonour you. [The King continues quietly looking toward the staircase, down which Iseult is seen advancing with a clear and upright carriage. Mark (to Iseult). Behold! Iseult, it is the peril to my peace I pray you have compassion of. Iseult. My lord, There is no fear in me for any action That you can put me to. Love of old time Brought order to the angry elements, And will assuage all discord. I obey This word of yours as if my mother bade me Pluck herbs in the garden for my fresher health. Appoint the time. Mark (glancing back at Tristan, as he kneels on the steps to Iseult). Tristan, if there be gods! Scene II Tintagel: the sea-shore in front of a steep cavern, a boat moored under a rock Tristan, in guise of a pilgrim, is pacing a narrow beach with stupendous cliffs above. He grasps a letter in his hands, and turns and reads and looks to sea. Tristan. She shall not bear the fire, God's shame on her! But I would rather bury her alive. What means this call to me, this strict command That I should stain my face, change my apparel, Become a pilgrim, habited like those Strange, holy men that met me on these coasts When first I landedâholy, holy faces, And carrying the sweets of sanctity About them in their persons, as the bees The sugar of the flowers? She bade me chaunt In prayers and psalms. I cannot pray for her, She does defy the heavens too wantonly: She is profane. But, oh, the Miserere For TristanâI can sing it with no feint. [He chaunts. âMiserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam. Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem meam. . . .â How my voice sounds up! No wonder; I am very far away, Cut off, cut off, as if the sea Closed on me, and I sat within a vault, Remembering the birds. No avenue! Cut off, cut off! [Iseult has entered the cavern by a secret passage, and for some time has been standing at the cavern's mouth. Iseult. Ah me! How woe-begone! But I forget the part I bade you play, A pilgrim. Tristan. I will play no more false parts. You must confessâthe king will pardon you; I will abjure your magic. Iseult (looking down into a deep tide-pool). Will you drown Like the void flagon? Gaily blows the wind; I cannot drop a tear. âIseult, ma mort.â Pilgrim, you have forgot your scallop-shell; But I will bind it on. [She picks up a scallop from the beach and slips it into the ribbon of his hat, looking into his face. âIseult, ma vie.â Tristan. What would you have me do? You put a hollowness In all I am. But promise me, beforeâ Before we part, you will not face the fire. Iseult. Before we part? Tristan. You go to the Ordeal, And I, a pilgrim, whither? Iseult. Say, my Tristan, Where of yourself you wend. Conceive yourself Washed up as on my lovely Irish coast, A strangerâ Tristan. Ah, I had not then drunk magic! I saw thy beauty, and in loyal passion Besought it for the king: then came the error, The deadly draught. It is incredible To Mark his friend should be to him a liar, Amazing, curious as a miracle I should betray. He does not hear the trumpets That blow their triumph through me in his presence, Blast of victorious trumpets, the wild curse With which they catch my heart. . . . Iseult. Break, break from this! God help me! Such fierce hate is in my heart To keep thee and to torture theeâa moan To be avenged. Thou dreamest we are parting; But I shall pass from branding iron to fire Of branding fagots, for I choose the iron. Tristan. Choose to be branded! All our love will be Henceforth as it is written of the brand, For men to read. It was a crystal sphere That swung round to itself. I was within, And all the music of the harmony That swept it through the heavens was Iseult. Oh, it is broken up! [He buries his face in his hands. Iseult looks forth, bites her lips, and then speaks very low over Tristan. Iseult. There is a service I beg of thee, to bear me from the ship, Such as thou shalt behold me, vilely clad In beggar's weeds, a penitent, to carry And lay me on the sands of Caerleon: No knight will touch me, For every knight feels toward me in his heart Even as thou. But with thy scallop-shell, Untaintable, a pilgrim, thou shalt bear me Fast in thy arms to Caerleon. I entreat. Tristan. For this thou calledst me? Iseult. Yea, holy man. Tristan. For this? [He lifts her and bears her a few paces along. Iseult (as he sets her down). Thou wilt slip footing on the shore, I know thou wilt. Meek pilgrims do but rarely Strive with such awful burthen in their arms. Thou wilt slip footing, fall, we shall be thrown Together, side by side, and I shall swear, By all the relics and the Holy Rood, Iseult has never borne embrace of man Save of her lord and this same clumsy pilgrim. Tristan (embracing and re-embracing Iseult). O fine, O venerable ruse! Ha, ha! What triumph for your lover! Is it thus That I must hold thee? I shall grip thee tight Against the plashing waves. Neptune forbid That I should kiss thee, though if he contend . . . Give me full measure now, rain kisses on me! How brief thy tenderness! Iseult. Poor, poor soiled pilgrim! What dost thou know but Cupid and his arrows, His vivid little pains, his petulance. Venus has none of these: her votaries She aids from secret caverns in the sea, And wraps them to herself. O Tristan, not By any guileful speech or crafty lie, I pass forth to my judges unafraid, But being upheld by the strong charms of Love, Of Venus, if you willâthese mysteries Are of the many gods. Awhile ago I thought you were too solemn for the hour, And trifled with you: now in very earnest, Mingling your hands with mine, I can make prayer To God to shield us: Holy Trinity, Ever to thee, thou threefold light, we turnâ Love, Love, ere we can falter, once more Love! Tristan. Iseult, O queenâoh, silence! Iseult. To thine oars! Thy task is simple. Mine!âoh, recollect The crown before mine eyes, the vast cathedral, The sickness and the shiver in the head. If I should fail, or if the jugglery Of swearing I have never lain in arms, Save of the pilgrim and my lord, were ill Approved of heavenâ Tristan. Heaven loves thy innocence, The king's great faith. And I shall see thy feet Bare on the stone, shall see thee in thy smock, Trembling for cold, yea, and for modesty, I should behold thee thus; for I shall see thee. It is all carven clear before my eyes How thou art only mine. Iseult. So vast a crowd! Scene III The Interior of the Minster Church at Caerleon, with view of the Choir, the Choir-aisles, and, on the north side, of the Sacristy; on the south side, of the little Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen. Relics are being laid on the altar; the King's throne is brought in. The Bishop of Thames, with attendant Priests, enters the Sacristy. Priest. Then will you put your robes on you, my lord? Bishop. It is not yet the hour. Shall we not pray? Priest. The king is in a marvellous distraction: He watched all night. Bishop. I cannot aid the king. [To Attendants who pass with brazier and bar of iron. Stir not so noisily. Remember, caitiffs, This lady is your queen. Of noble grace She yields her to the bitter degradation. [To others. Bear very humbly This habit of a penitent, this girdle, Round to St. Mary's Chapel. Churls, remember The thorns, the nails, the scourge that we adore Are but adored as they are instrument Of torture to pure sanctity. Step softly. [He kneels. Slowly a crowd begins to fill the Church. Iseult and Brangaena enter St. Mary's Chapel. Attendants set the brazier, hissing round the iron, before the altar. Melot props himself against a column and looks up. Melot. I wonder . . . Is it in this woman to put forth the miracle of truth? If she do it, we will trouble no more for the philosopher's stone. [An Attendant approaches him. Attendant. We may not disturb the bishop, we may not disturb the king. Do we set the queen's throne beside the king's? Melot. Assuredly, and lay across the seat Her golden robes and over them the tarnished And venerable crown that at her marriage King Mark set on her head. He will re-crownâ That is the ceremony. Move with care. [Iseult puts aside her regal robes. Brangaena receives a dark woollen garment and twisted cord from an Attendant; then, the penitent's dress in her hand, she watches Iseult, as if transfixed. Iseult. Help me; my crown is tangled in my hair, My hair unloops: it must be tightly bound. Help me . . . I tremble . . . I am not afraid, Except at bungling. There! Brangaena. You snapt the circlet With your fierce handling. Iseult. There! The crown, the jewelsâ And, see, this little topaz at my heart, With all my silks and raiment, the brown samite. . . Brangaena. Ay, beautyâ Iseult. There! I give them to the poor. Brangaena (holding the topaz in her hand). This? Iseult. Oh, how blessÃ¨d is the emptiness! In my hands nothing. Sweet, I cannot wait. This power is not for ever in my heart. Help me, unknot this girdle, help, Brangaena! O mortal cruelty! How thou art dangling That topaz . . . Throw it to the jewel-heap; And bid them hasten. Brangaena. Let me guard it, Queen: Not that it is a jewelâfor thine heart. [Iseult takes the topaz and flings it away. Iseult. Is Tristan safe? I shall have need of him In all the buzz when they are giving thanks. Brangaena. Tristan is fled. Iseult, how cold you are! How far apart! Your feet are in my hands; I try to chafe them. Think of me a little! You are not dying: then I know the face Looks off as it were staring at a sea, And has no pity? Nay, be merciful! Iseult (rubbing her hands together). But, sweet, I cannot wait: This power is not for ever in my heart. Help me, unknot this girdle, help, Brangaena! [Brangaena, as if waking, dresses her as a penitent. Brangaena. Though you are dark and humble before God. Sweet, wild one, yet God knows it is a mask; He will not be deceived: you go forth guilty To the ordeal, and the iron will burn. [A pilgrim passes up the south aisle, and enters the choir, brushing Melot, who slightly shrugs his shoulders. Iseult. Is Tristan safe? I shall have need of him In all the buzz, when they are giving thanks. Brangaena. Tristan is fled. (Suddenly clasping her knees.) Iseult, be merciful. Have mercy on me! What is Tristan's love? He flees. But I am with you at the pyre, And may not burn beside you. Pity me! I cannot let you go. There is love Of woman unto woman, in its fibre Stronger than knits a mother to her child. There is no lack in it and no defect; It looks nor up nor down; But loves from plenitude to plenitude, With level eyes, as in the Trinity God looks across and worships. O my dear, To keep you moving in and out my days! Let me go forth and to the multitude Publish the story of my great neglect; And I will take the iron in my hand, And pray that it may burn me to the bone, If all I speak before the holy bishop, The king and all his lieges, be not true: That you are under spell and innocent, That you and the lord Tristan are as one, Are fashioned to each other, as the cup To acorn; and no other use is yours, Or purpose in the world. Iseult (breathing hard). But where is Tristan? Go, peep into the church. I hear such noises, I am turned sick. [King Mark enters and takes his throne. Tell me what you behold, And if they soon will come to summon us. [Exit Brangaena into the Church. I quail a little, I am very chill. If he have shrunk away! He disappears As suddenly as I have heard Tintagel's Whole fairy fabric falls from tower to base, As in a dream, at the appointed day. Re-enter Brangaena Brangaena. The king is waiting: he is on his throne; He becked me to him, said that he should crown youâ I could have bowed me down upon my knees, But for an awe. . . . I could have owned my sin, And wrought you liberation. Iseult. He shall crown me. What saw you, what beside? Brangaena. Close to the altar A pilgrim, very fervent at his prayers. He trembled as I passed him. Iseult (with a low laugh). At his prayers, Poor devil! [She takes a step toward the Church, then hastily returns to Brangaena. Sweet, I will not kiss you now; But afterwards. . . . Come first, for the first kiss. Brangaena (detaining her). The bishop is not robed. Iseult. The iron glows; I have to seize the iron. Follow me. O Love, Love, Love, Thou burn'st too hot: the iron will drop cold And hissing at my feet. Brangaena, you Have saved me, for your crystal cup it is Sustains me at this hour. Walk steadily. . . . You must not stay me. . . . I must walk alone. [She goes far up the aisle and by the side-door enters the choir, ascends the steps, to the amazement of all, passes Tristan, snatches the iron from the brazier, goes back a few steps and waits the Bishop who, with a procession, advances. In dumb-show the relics are uncovered, a vow is proposed and repeatedâat the end of the repetition Iseult waves her hand toward the pilgrim, praying with hidden face: then in a voice that can just be heard the Bishop speaks. Bishop. Lay down the iron. [He descends the steps, with her, lifting her hand. See, the hand unscarred. Iseult. Brangaena! [She embraces her. Bishop, but this faithful soul Hath not passed scathless through her agony. [Looking round. I thank you, gentle people, for your prayers; [Fixing her eyes on Tristan, who has fallen prone on the altar-steps. You have remembered how a soul is lonely, Being accused. (To Bishop.) Now lead me to my lord. [She stands before the King, who has risen, with clasped hands. No speech between us: you have promised triumph. Crown me! (To Brangaena.) Lay on my robes. [The Bishop and King place the crown on her head. The Church is thrilled with strange music. Iseult again stoops to Brangaena and kisses her: the crowd looks up reverently as to some miracle. Iseult. BelovÃ¨d, it is thou and I that hear, Not that poor pilgrim, thou and I together: We share the secret. Is it not the same Sweet singing, as of currents in the air, That you so oft have told me ravished you When the little flask was sealed? Brangaena. It is the same. [She falls in swoon at Iseult's feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Scene I The Chapel Courtyard. Tintagel Early morning in spring To the right a wing of the Castle, in the centre the Chapel, to the left the Queen's House with an upper window, giving on to a boscage between the House and the Chapel. King Mark stands in the porch of the Chapel: through a side-window he can watch the Queen's window. Mark. Sometimes she rests her arms along the ledge And smiles and looks abroad. That is the greeting I wait for: all the rest is heaviness. O eyes, the dearest in the world, that keep For me December's coldness through springtideâ But not for him! They through their innermost blue Are favouring, and as they dwell on him They spread into a mercy all may see, That all do see. But here I watch her smiles Falling, in spring-tide, on my senseless woods. [Iseult appears at the window. So one may catch A woman's face at rarest, raised to heaven, Or lighting at some pleasure in herself. Iseult (listening to the birds). O limpid, it is like the dew in flower! Anotherâah, that snatches as a scythe That cuts into a score of varied sweets. One that is all in silver to itself . . . Enter Tristan, strolling through the boscage toward the Chapel, whistling bird-notes. And oneâhow masterful the melody, Buoyant and greeting and indifferent! [Bending from the window. Sweet, O sweet The voices of the spring, and sweet to hear The sweetest. Tristan. Queen, that was a common snatch. Would you were free To go forth to the woods; there are such notes As must be caught in silence. Iseult. Would, ah, would, Tristan, that we were free! Tristan. I must pray for you, Taken in such light temptation. Iseult (withdrawing from the window). To your prayers! [Tristan doffs to the Queen, then gaily passes on his way to Matins. At the Chapel-door he meets Mark. Tristan (saluting him). I am heart-struck with the dayânew-springing day! . . . [Mark sets his hand violently on Tristan's arm. Mark. Tristanâ Tristan. Oh, what is this? Mark. My pleasure, Tristan; my resolve; the joy Of hearing you, my minstrel. You have sung Yourself free of the cage! I set you loose. . . . Those penetrating, sovereign notesâwhy, even A murderer's heart were softened at their fall. Go forth, pair in the singing woods. Go forth Together, true to what you are, together As paramours! Tristan. I whistled on my way To Chapel and the Queen arrested me, And bade me mock the oriole and spoke Of how sweet freedom is. . . . [Iseult comes out of her house to the Chapel, as the Bishop of Thames advances followed by Priests and Lords. Mark takes Iseult by the hand and sets her at Tristan's side. Mark. My lords, from you I ask no counsel: I deliver judgment, And bid you but be mute. (To Iseult.) Unhood, unhood, And let us hear Your morning music to the sky. Iseult (throwing back her hood and looking up). The sky Is very fair; The birds are singing. In my heart I sighed To be free with them; and the prayer came fast For succour in temptation. The Bishop (taking Iseult's hand). By ordeal And in God's sight these twain are justified. Behold this unscarred hand. A breath's offence, A moment's mitigation of the harsh Rigours of duty, a too liberal Interpretation of the morning's softness, Are lovable infirmities, and in Offending youth and beauty no offence. Mark (striking Iseult's hand out of the Bishop's). My lords, I care not now a jot where the truth lies, Since God says this of them and April that! We must believe the spring the churchman saysâ It is a new religion that exists Of its own depth and is effectual Through disallowance. Then believe the spring! Here is ordeal! Does the sunlight blast her? The birds keep song; all that is in her heart Is full of majesty. Look not so grave; Nothing of this fair beauty shall be marred. I have a sentenceâ'tis a mock, a jest, A ritual of the May. Take hands, take hands! There should be joy in springâthe ice must crack. I loose you from our bond and leave you twain! The king, who knowing it, Doth company with lovers, is a fool. Go, Tristan, goâfor of our fellowship You are not any more. . . . Your silent mouth Movesâlet it keep its silence. Queen Iseult . . . Queen of the May, turn from me to your lord, Turn to Sir Tristan, take his hand; take hands! [Iseult, with a radiant face, lays her hand in Tristan's: he bows to the King and Court, and leads her forth as from an altar. Many incline as they pass and follow them with a gaze of admiration and pity. Then the procession enters the Church. Melot steps out from among the Lords and lingers behind with the King. Melot. What have you doneâwhat madness? Mark. Let them go, Renounced them to the season. All my cattle From all my stables rush now in the meadows; The million trees spring into arborets, Leaves, flowers of rare and undistinguished beauty For the time's purpose. There at least is truth . . . Melot. Where will you go? [Mark looks out far over the waves. Mark. The sea roars round Tintagel; Where should I go but shipless to the sea? Melot (pointing to the Chapel). Why you must pray; the little door is open, The Matins are not sung. [Mark stares at him bewildered. All creatures pray, And bring a change to pass. Mark. God is not blind: In me there is no worship. Melot. Love is blind. Love sees things white, white as the driven snow. There, pass within! [The King, with bowed head, goes into the Chapel. Scene II Morais. A Forest-glade in May To the right an interior of a domed cave, a bed of rushes on the floor of crystal rock; a loaf and a few other things on a shelf of the same rock; Tristan's harp and hunting-horn slung on a spar. A window is seen in the roof, attainable from without by climbing the sylvan slope of turf. A brazen door, now standing open, gives on broken ground of the forest, that stretches from the cave to a linden-tree in first leaf and a spring with a stream out of it. Grass and flowers everywhere. Tristan and Iseult come down the rocks of the wild-wood Tristan. Let me lift thee, all the boulders are not mossed; Thy feet are weary. [She springs into his arms. Warm cheeks, where fresh roses Are being mingled with the loveliest roses! And yet thy hand is cold as water filling A silver bowl, how shrewdly to the sense. Come, let us rest. [Sweeping the grass with his hand. The dew is almost gone. [They seat themselves by the fountain. Iseult. O Tristan, what a sound Of peace and ardour; how the little waters From the rock-vein are never intermitted In song from jet to brink. And thou art here With me among the lilies, the small lilies, So unsuspected at the woodland's core, We breathe them from a whiteness held remote By the verdure of their bowers. Tristan. Breathe them lonely, Till I have brought out Kurvenal's dry loaf, And the dry grapes, And fetched a rill for breakfast in my horn. [He goes into the cave and brings out what there is to eat. He then brings water in his horn and they begin their meal. Iseult. No bread! I'll steep the raisins. Fie, you men, I think you could eat bark like woodpeckers. [She watches him devour a crust. O loved, are we not happy? Tristan. Even as in Paradise. Iseult. I would not hear The name of any other place or give A name to this young freshness by the stream. [On her elbows on the grass. O little flowers and meadow-slips and tangle Of growing things for June, there is no circlet So sweet as one my lover can enwreathe Of your young shoots and coral. See, this clover! Twist me a wreath and I will shine so fair That you will pledge me queen of all the forests Of Cornwall and of Parmenie and Erin, Till the last summer tumbles into gold. I will enchant you. Tristan. What, a clover-wreath! [He plucks flowers and they weave a chaplet together, with which he crowns her. She nestles beside him, her head on his shoulder. [A far away horn-call. Listen! Iseult (rising impetuously). Shut close the door, And let us to the cavern! Tristan. Stay, this trail Is right away. No fear, no fear! Iseult. But listen! Tristan. No danger, love Iseult. Think you that Mark Hunts through the wilderness? Iseult. One joy, one sorrow, One love, one life between usâand one dread. Tristan. No dread! Iseult. O comfortable voice, but I am shaken . . . [Another blast rings along the distance. The horn again! Oh, how I hate the sound! Tristan. And I a hunter! [A very distant horn is heard. Iseult. You will leave me, Tristan; You mustâah, might it be here in the woods: For then I should not light my pyre. So close I keep me to the rivers and the trees, Like Byblis, I should drop down in a fountain When I was weary of pursuing thee; Or else like Phyllis . . . often by this linden I have thought upon her story, how she felt She was forgotten in the great affairs That drew Demophoon to Attica, And breathed her sighs into the leaves so deeply She found herself amid the waving branches, And, being rocked of the great winds, had peace. When you go forth to huntâyou are a hunter, And you must leave meâleave me in the woods! Tristan (impatiently). But this is music; I must set my harp To such a song. Iseult. You will not greatly suffer; You have your harp. I see that you are chafing To track the horn. [She walks from him to the cave; at the threshold she stands and looks back at him, then lies down on the couch of rushes, with glistening eyes. Tristan (as he follows her into the cave). NayâI will bar the door, And we will rest till noon. He does not seek us; But this for utter safety, if he come. [He unsheathes his sword and lays it by her. Iseult. Tristan, put back your sword. Divide us not In soul and body, while your glittering falsehood Flows by me with base laughter. I revolt. In Love's name, by his arrows, I conjure Your flagrant, trothless weapon from my couch. Quench itâthe sinister, cold-flowing steel! Tristan. The sword must stay; it guards you. I am judge, In danger, of the means. Forgive, forgive! And turn to sleep. Iseult. How can you so reproach Your forest-queen? Tristan. That she should be assoiled Before the world. Iseult. O Tristan! Tristan. Sleep, forget. Iseult. We are apart and of your will. Tristan. No woman Can brook a lover's screen. You fret me. Sleep! [He goes to the door and pauses. How full of song The forestâan announcing, tell-tale jangle, And weary to my head. The horn has filled me With bent for change, and there is listlessness In country haunts. But Kurvenal will come At noontide from Tintagel with his news: Meantime I must keep guard upon the grotto. (Turning back.) 'Tis breathing-time with her, Deep sleep and rest. O perfect loveliness! The holy clover round her eyes, the weapon Alert beside her, she enravishes More that she foils audacity. One kiss Across the spiteful flash! O god of Love, Be worshipped that this check is but a lie. [He shuts the door and secures it. There is a near horn-call; King Mark and his Master-Huntsman come through the forest. Huntsman. The doe's-track ceases. Where then is our quarry? Mark. See, in the crystal rock a brazen doorway. Huntsman. Then this, Sir King, is a love-grot, once hollowed By giants of heathen ages in the hillside For secret dalliance, and then closely sealed By Christian monarchs as a haunt of devils. Mark. This door inside and very hard is fastened. Huntsman. A marvel! Such-like caverns in a mountain Are lighted, so my father's father told him, With windows through the rock's acclivity. Shall I make search over and round the ridges? Mark. Thou shalt. [The Huntsman climbs. This weary hunting that brings freshness To head and cheek, but to the heart no service! Huntsman. Here is the casement, clear of roots and staring. Mark. What see you? Huntsman. Christ, 'tis magic! Is she mortal? Mark. A living soul within? Huntsman. A man and woman Each side a sword that twinkles glassily. The man is even as other men, the woman . . . But I will look no further. Mark. How you tremble! Huntsman (springing down). Look not, my king, come with me from the cavern. Mark (climbing). Is this the zigzag that you took? Huntsman. God help you! Mark (looking in). Even so. Good huntsman, lead my hounds to kennel; I hunt no more this forest. All go home. [Exit Huntsman. My heart is cold with joyâthe naked sword, They in their beauty and seclusion: round them Noon's fervid hour; both guileless, innocent. O Easter-day, how can my heart arise To greet a joy like this! Iseult! Thy face Hot, flushed with childish vermeil, underneath The purple chaplet of the clover-flower; Thy sunlit mouth, so lovable, my kisses Would rain down in a galaxy of flames, As though this sun had sped them! Stay, a shaft Falls harmfully; it will awaken her. Ah, Tristan, I can shield her slumber too: Thou with thy good drawn blade, I with this rumple Of leaves and grass and flowers in mat and lattice Across the flood of day. God keep thee secret! [After covering the window, he descends and goes out. Iseult (within). Tristan! wake! Tristan! wake! We have been spied and from the casement yonder, For it is closed with grasses, lily-leaves, And bluebells. Tristan! Tristan (within). I will look around. [He unbars and opens the door. Oh, here are steps! We are discovered. We must flyâbut where? How get thee to a vessel? All the coast His spies will guard against us. O sweet days, For ever shaken from us! Yet if Mark Spied on us, heaven be praised the sword was there. Iseult. Would he had seen the truth and drew us now From lambent Maytime to the lighted stakeâ An indivisible close! Where is your pulse? I would be firewood to a blaze that quenched My ashes with thy ashes. Enter Kurvenal Tristan. Kurvenal, Our refuge is discovered. Kurvenal. By the King. He met me on the forest-edge and bade me Seek you with prayer you would return to him, You and his Queen, unhazarded in honour, Pardoning and faultless. He recalls his wife And you the prince and heir of Cornwall, pledging To you his kingdom's welcome, and oblivion Of all past mischief in the people's tongue. 'Tis generous homage from a King, my lord; See thou demean thee in observance worthy Of such a reconcilement. [He is going into the cave with a loaf when Iseult calls him back. Iseult. Kurvenal, Carry his harp away, he is impatient, And it is time to part. My holy crown Shall drench its triplet leaves in the blessed fountain Still voluble of us, that gives my queenship The lightning of a smile. [She throws her clover-crown into the water. Farewell, Farewell! O sun and valleys, he knows not where he goes! Scene III Tintagel. The King's Hall; gloaming A harp is heard; gradually by the uncertain light the faces are discerned A crowd gathers at the open doorway as Tristan sings Tristan. Helen of Troy, Helen of Troy! And the dead men on the plain; They wrap them in their winding sheets, They cover up the slain; But none may bury the lovely face That hath wrought men all their painâ Helen of Troy, Helen of Troy, We would look on you again! Mark. To have you and once more to have your harp, Tristan, beloved! Tristan. Once more to have my harp. Mark. You set my heart a-bleeding with your music. It is my penitence. Tristan. No, no, it is the music . . . I listen to it deeper than you all: It is the silence that it leaves behind. [Iseult steals in at the back of the hall, deeply hooded. (Very softly.) Helen of Troy, Helen of Troy, We would look on you again! Iseult (low to Melot). I stole up from my sick-bed to this music; But music is the enemy of love, And tears it from its bonds. Melot (restraining her). Atune, atune! [She vanishes. Scene IV The orchard at Tintagelâas in Act II., Scene V A burning noon at midsummer The Queen's chamber in the background, reached by shallow steps. Melot is talking to himself among the old apple-trees hung with mistletoe. Melot. The world must not be governed by Beauty, and the world must not be governed by Love. O ancient Druids, if yours were the secret! Guardians of the Universe, shedders of blood, requiring the renunciation of all things that the heart may a little feel the dew! But what is this? A procession from the Queen's chamber! [Melot draws back among the sweeping boughs of the apple-trees as the Queen's maidens come down the orchard with white and purple cushions which they spread on the grass. Then they sit down on the edge of the cushions and weave daisies. Nessa. Jocelinde, are you weeping? Will she die? Jocelinde. It thrills me through to touch her, like a harp. Nessa. She will not die . . . (Picking a daisy.) She loves him, loves him not, Loves him. . . . Come closer, Jocelinde! She loves Lord Tristan. Jocelinde (rising and settling the cushions). This is all she bade us do. [Iseult is borne in a litter down the orchard. She is dressed completely in cloth of gold. Brangaena is beside her. Iseult (to Brangaena). So hot a noon! (To the Maidens.) Remember that you say I am asleep. And trouble not to seek me till the eve, For I would lie a long while in the sun. [The Maidens pass down the orchard, up the steps into the Queen's chamber. Iseult pushes a low bough aside and looks up. The sky is very hot . . . and nowâfetch Tristan! Fetch me the crystal cup You plunged into the sea, give me the flagon, The dim strong-scented wine that rose like music, That sank down in my heart to swell again! I cannot bear this consciousness: my senses Are idle as the war-horse on the plain, That hears the battle-neigh, that has no rider, That champs and cannot graze. Fetch Tristan to me. [Melot advances and stands before the litter, the postern-gate behind him. [Startled and as if in defence. Melot, how often you have led Sir Tristan Here to this orchard, and in Love's own name. Melot. How often! And to-day he must not come. Iseult. Then I must die! Melot (eagerly). It is a magic power. Iseult. Melot, you do not kill yourself; a dwarf You are and loved of none, and yet you live. What do you live for? Melot. For the seasons, child. To see the snow againâit is enough. My eyes have gathered simples from their sight, And I have looked so far I do not weep. Iseult's Iseult, Is there no magic in you, and no power For the scents upon the air? . . . Death is the charm: It is what you have drunk: your Fate persists, And she is standing by an open grave. Iseult. I cannot! Melot, you as well might ask The apple-trees, when every branch is crimson, Of their own will to crackle in the fire. I cannot dieânot for a hundred years. Since I have drunk the cup There can be no more dying any more. Melot. You tempt your lover to his death. Iseult. Temptation! You say I tempt . . . [With free laughter in response to Melot's face. There is no Paradise To woman, till her Paradise is lost. It is so sweet to fall into temptation, And to draw down, to lead Down to the edges of the precipice. You seeâit is the Charm! . . . You love the King: You will betray us? Melot. Were that for his peace? You think Love has one season and one office! Iseult. But one; we do not weary of our food; We should renounce our breath, renouncing it. Melot, I am not steady for discourse; I am estranged from youâthe great estrangement Betwixt the living and the dead. (To Brangaena.) Fetch Tristan! (More bitterly to Melot.) You love the King and you would see me dead. Melot. Ay, if you cannot change; For we must die, or ripen, or be loathed. [Brangaena unperceived slips through the postern. The Charm is out, And you can raise no further incantation. Iseult (rousing herself). The Charm is out! Brangaena! Melot. She is sped. [He turns down the orchard and passes through the open door of the Queen's chamber. Iseult. He leaves me, and he is my Genius. I have no power to call . . . But I am glad! [Again lying back and looking up to the sky. O ecstasyâthe serpent in the grass, And the stillness of the dazzle! Tristan, Tristan! With every hour his lustrousness falls off. . . . O little verdant paths, my feet are aching; I walk on burning ploughshares, day and night, But none are curious; I may suffer now . . . My lover is grown kindâ As one should speak of age in youth; this kindness Is contract between mortals . . . He delays; I tremble, and a music rushes through me That cannot find its way. O my Desire! Tristan enters: for a moment he does not perceive the Queen And now I see him with no other eyes At rest on himâO God! [As Tristan approaches. You stayed too long; I have grown cold, and I am sick. Tristan. Beloved, But I am all your sickness. Iseult. All. Tristan. What is it That flushes you so darkly? [He kisses her hand. Iseult. Nay, no more, No more joy of you! 'Tis the crystal cup That binds usâwe are utter weariness And dolour to each other; our desire Burns, as the spices that embalm Love's corse, And leaps and sparkles as Love's very brand. O Love, O Charm! The Charm is broken up; The crystal flagon has sailed far to sea; The sea-wrack has set root in it; it sails A hairy skull across the universe. Now. . . . You would pledge me, and there is no wine, Only great recollections and the hour. O misery, what are you? Tristan. I am Tristan. Wherein have I offended, that you keep So sealed from me? It is like banishment. Wherefore? Iseult. So Melot asks, so asks Brangaena, So Love would never ask. Lie back a little, Your arm across my pillow! Ah, as sweet To me as hydromel and bergamot. . . . Now swear me all your curse. Tristan. Heart's Sorrow, hush! God shield us, there are voices Within your chamber. [Iseult more closely clasps him. There is struggle even . . . [Seeking to free himself. Sweet, for your sake . . . [His eyes remain fascinated on the open doorway of Iseult's chamber. There is the sound of a scuffle. Presently the King stands on the threshold: he meets Tristan's gaze, and silently withdraws, closing the door. Iseult, love, you behold not! Iseult. How should I? Still so fearful of the flame? Tristan, it does not scorch; it hurts no more Than yonder blazing noon. Feel my soft hand; Put by all terror; wait as in a trance. Are you my lover, Tristan? I put on For you my wedding-raiment, this gold raimentâ Nothing I wear has ever been King Mark's. Look, look! [She passes her hand through her hair. How the gold matches with the gold . . . No grey: I never will bear age for you. Am I not blonde? Tristan (starting). There is a flow of blood Down from your chamber-door. Yet all is silent. Love, it is trickling down to us. Iseult. What matter! Sweep back my hair. Conceive The glory wouldst thou lay me on the pyre, Carry and lay me there: I would enfold thee In my swift arms of flame. Tristan (still gazing toward the place where Mark stood). You shall not die, God's peace, you shall not. We must bid farewell, For ever we must bid farewell. Iseult. For ever? Then to the waste again, then to the storms! And paths that are but foot-prints in the sand, One's own fresh foot-prints. I shall let you go; I shall walk on alone! But take this ring, A pledge, a jewel, an eternal kiss . . . For I shall ever dwell within thy heart, As Christ's own wounds dwell with Him evermore, In Heaven with God, or wandering 'mid the damned! [Pressing her face down on his arm. Rememberâ I shall awake . . . remember, let it haunt you How I awake, how I breathe through the noon, The sunset, and the long close of the night. Tristan. Thy wedding-dress, Thou art in thy wedding-dress . . . [Kissing the ring. Our love henceforth Be vain and be for ever. Cloth of gold . . . Iseult. The Charm is broke! Tristan. The Charm is just begun. Pure cloth of gold . . . [He stands apart from her for an instant with wide, blank stare, then, sharply turning, goes out by the postern. Iseult (deeply sighing). Then I will bend myself To his pleasure and be lissomeâplay the harlot Here, in the orchard. I will veil myself, I must, I am not dim. [She stretches herself, veiled, as if recovering from sleep, as King Mark, Courtiers, the Bishop of Thames and Priests enter and draw back. All. Alone! The Queen alone! [The King comes forward, his arms wide to Iseult. Then suddenly he turns to his Court. Mark. Truth, truth! And I surprised A noontide sleep in the orchard. Go your ways, Speed on, return to villages and streets. If you encounter A troop of lepers on your way, with haste Bid them come tinkling hither. I have one To join to their abhorred company. [The Courtiers, Bishop, and Priests retire. Iseult, What would you? You are damned so very deep I would but pamper you as all the fiends Are pampering. You keep a royal stateâ Would you still keep it? Would you be my Queen? You smile: none other Can fetch that smile, and I have rarer jewels; My sceptreâyou shall wield itâanything That I can give you, ask! . . . for I would sell My soul to please you. Could I join your tribe. And catch you underneath this burning heaven! I am devoted to you now, Iseult; It is a magic hour. Iseult. Sire, I would live. . . . Let me live on To sunset, and the long close of the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V Scene I By a burial-mound in Parmenie Tristan and the Sons of Rual A Son of Rual. Lord Tristan, it is yonder. There they lie, Thy foster-father and thy foster-mother; One for ten years alone, before he bedded His dust in peace with hers he so had loved That every night he prayed to lay him down By her spent earth. Tristan. She was a silent light, Gay in the shadow, that we men discovered As strangely to our need. A Son of Rual. Dear liege, you loved her: And as she died and lay in amplitude Of passing with all unction to her God, Her eyes went round our group dissatisfied, And a babe's voice cried at her husky lips For Tristan. Tristan. God allow she sees me weeping Beside this solemn grass! The good are mighty; They are the power of God within the world. I kiss this mound . . . the ash-leaves drifting over Fall rightlier than my kisses. Foster-brothers, By Rual's grave I could cry out for bread, I stand so beggared in my emptiness Beside the rich, informing solitude Where saints are buried. Let us go! . . . Yet linger One moment while the arc of sunset sinks Down the great arc of the turfed sepulchre. It is my chastisement to feel the blessing, I cannot take, relentless in its passion To find me what I was when young and loyal I left the land. [A cry from the Sons of Rual. Sons of Rual. Remain! Father and mother, we have laid to rest, But God hath sent thee back, and with one voice, One heart, we pray thee bide in thy own land, With thy own men. Tristan. Forgive! I still must wander; My feet must hasten from this grassy turf And little crackling grass-shells that I crush. I cannot stay . . . Forgive me! A Son of Rual. Wherefore seek Continual, sad adventure? Enter Kahedin Tristan. Who is this? He has an English face, a cheerful health Of beauty, the brave lad! . . . Much of my build Before I reached Tintagel. A Son of Rual. Kindly greeting! Kahedin. Is not that man, long-limbed and tall and wasted, The great Sir Tristan? A Son of Rual. Our liege lord, Sir Tristan. Kahedin. May I have speech with him? Tristan. He listens, boy. As to himself, for he was scarce your age When last he stood where you are standing now, Your great lord Tristan. Kahedin. I am Kahedin, The only son of the Duke Jovelin Of Arundel, that lies on English sea-coast With southern crouch. My father's enemies Have power beyond his compass of defence: His land is waste, his villages in ruin, Or smoking from their wild-fires to the wind; His thralls and beasts are driven in multitude To alien fields. And I am come to pray thee, The mightiest lord of war in all the islands, To aid my father. Tristan. I will aid him, boy. Kahedin. I am a Knight. Tristan. Sir Kahedin, your hand. Will you be mine in friendship? Kahedin. To my death. Tristan (turning to the Sons of Rual). I need your aidâfive hundred men at least With store of food and forage. Muster swiftlyâ We ride to-night. Kahedin. O miracle! My father Will welcome us in five short days; Iseult My sister come to meet you. Tristan. Has the duke Your father but one daughter? And her name? You said her name . . . Kahedin. Iseult. Tristan. And is she fair, Iseult, your sister? Kahedin. Yea, my lord, a maiden Of beauty very still, as for itself. She has white hands. Iseult of the White Hands We call her for their loveliness of white. Tristan. A winning grace, white hands! Come, you and I Banquet together, ere they harness us. (Turning back.) Farewell, dear grave. We leave thee in thy dusk: The stars will comeâthe evening star is come, Farewell! Scene II Arundel: a corridor of the Castle; through the columns the great Hall is seen lit and full of guests, breaking from a dance. Couples pass out of the Hall down the corridor. It is near midnight. Duke Jovelin is talking to an old friend and guest under a column Jovelin. Sir, I have a son, a son that is no longer his own master. Kahedin has chosen him a lord; my daughter has chosen her a lord: they have chosen the same lord. But what matter! This Sir Tristan is an enchanter. The Guest. That is what I fearâif there should be infatuation, and our land ruined. Jovelin. Tut, tut! The land is not ruined that is infatuated, the land is not in ruin that welcomes happiness. We are a small people: a very great warrior is come among us. There is no such Roman Knight alive; he carries the banner of the Empire to its triumphâhe is come to rule, and he shall rule us all. I am devoted to him as his faithful servant, Kurvenal. The Guest. My lord, would you have us transfer our allegiance to Sir Tristan? Jovelin. Ay, now that Sir Tristan is my son. It is a happy marriage, a blest marriageâthe Smile of Heaven is upon it. Look thereâ [He points through the moonlit corridor. Look where our beeches slope across the land, How pleasantly . . . Sir Tristan has established Our Dukedom in such settlement, the bird Broods o'er her nest, her patience unannulled; The seasons have their flow and reckless summer Dare gambol for a while. A happy marriage! [He turns from the moonlight to the lamplit guest-room. Now we shall all breathe free, and my old age drop down in dreams to God. [Tristan and Iseult of Arundel cross the Hall, hand in hand. My dove is a rare dove . . . I drew them together; the harp did much, but her father more: I drew them together with the warm guile of age. [Kahedin and a lady pass out: they are followed by other couples seeking the fresh night. The old Guest is greeted and joins the procession. Soâthey pass! [A band of youths enters from the other end of the corridor. But we must still give welcome; we must stand at the portal and give welcome to the young. Our welcome, welcome! [The wedding-guests, saluting him, pass into the Hall. Tristan and Iseult of Arundel come out together. O comfortable Vision! [He passes them with a smile and a gesture of blessing, then goes within. Tristan. My little princess of the darting eyes, So tender, And small and dark, thine eyes are mine far closer Than any jewel that I wearâtheir tears, And their wet shining when I play the harp. Iseult of Arundel. Tristan, your harpâit is the dearest thing To me in all the world. Tristan. You love my harp? Iseult of Arundel. It is my glory . . . Burthen of Iseult! I have no musicâ But I have wooed you to the brink of death With sighs, with open, long-drawn sighs, with service Too eager for the bidding of your thoughts. I need no longer strive. En vous ma vie. Tristan (caressing her). Mad, little echo, but you must not take Such wild reverberation from the hills, Of life or death: the bleating flocks, the call And invocations of the shepherd-folk Alone should stir these lips. Iseult of Arundel. âO Love, Iseultâ I echo what you breathe me, you sweet Angel! Tristan. Beloved, How sweet thou art! Iseult of Arundel. I love thee. Tristan. Ah, I wonder! It is a wish I found among my thoughts. Iseult of Arundel. I loved thee all the while. Tristan. There is no hatred In thy soft face, nor any pride with hate. Thou must not change, Iseult. Iseult of Arundel. Tristan, âIseultâ Is music on thy lips and to my ears Excelling music. Perilous, sweet eyes . . . How I have watched them in their wanderings More than thou ever canst have knowledge of. Look down, look down upon me. Tristan. Ah, most sweet. Soon they will come to lead thee to thy bridal, To pluck thee from meâand then give thee back My own for ever. [As he withdraws his arm, caressing her, a ring drops from his finger on the floor. Iseult of Arundel. Tristan, give it me! I covet it; thou hast no other gem. Tristan, a bridal gift. Not on thy hand; There it displeases me. Tristan. O Gentleness, But thou art mine, and all my will to ruleâ [Struggling to speak. . . . Sweet wife, If I may trust theeâ I must wear this ring Through the ages, in my tomb. Iseult. Is it a vow? Tristan (staring at it, as he slowly turns it round his finger). I had forgotten it . . . Now like a ghost It haunts me with remembrance of a vow. [The Matrons are seen gathering in the midst of the Hall, and receiving each a torch. Thy Women Come for thee . . . [Kneeling to her. Fairest, but the vow forbids Our marriage-rites until a year be passed. I give this secret to thee as the jewel Of my own soul: I have no other gift. [Iseult of Arundel swoons. Tristan supports her, and then lays her in the arms of the women, who have advanced with their torches. Bear her away. Oh, comfort her! [She is carried out by the Matrons. Beside him, She sits beside him; we are coupled now, Chained, coupled each of us! I have been free, Free to forget her, free! Iseult, Iseult! Would I were in the tomb. Kahedin (returning). A longing bridegroom. Come, cheer! The revels fail. Tristan. I am struck to death. Jovelin (approaching). They say the bride has swoonedâ Nay, nayâher father Is not too anxious. I have set a measure To check the laugh. Tristan. A measureâI will lead. [Exeunt into the Hall, as the minstrels strike up the measure of a dance. Scene III A wild slope covered with brambles, under the walls of Arundel Castle Tristan and Kahedin are walking together: suddenly Tristan sits down on the root of a beech-tree. Tristan. You strive, And follow me about, and cannot open This secret that is guilt: I know your trouble: She that you love is wedded. Kahedin. She is mine, As your Iseult is yours. Tristan. Yea, for all ages Iseult is Tristan's. . . . I will keep you guarded To night with naked sword. Kahedin. How prompt you are, How merciful. . . . But, Tristan, thinkâthe peril! [Looking at him uneasily. You are not going to your doom? Tristan. . . . So surely Love crumbles all things, it must come to pass. Kahedin. You know this love? What must be told of it? Tristan (looking out over the country). That it must come to pass, And that it crumbles all things, even itself, Even its own desires. Kahedin. Tristan, my brother! Tristan (rising quickly). For this adventure. [Kahedin perceives his sister straying among the clumps of covert. Kahedin. I have told her all. [He goes out as Tristan advances towards Iseult of Arundel. Tristan. What are you doing? Iseult of Arundel. Gathering blackberries. Tristan. You shall not. They will stain your handsâwhite hands, These whitest hands. [He takes her hands, kisses and fondles them. She stops picking the berries. Iseult of Arundel. My lord, your will to me Is sweeter than the taste of any fruit, And it is all I haveâyour will, your pleasure. Tristan. Pleasure of mine! Iseult of Arundel. Were there compassion in you, If you could feelâ Tristan. What can I do for you, Nor break my vow? Iseult of Arundel. Sing to me, as you sang, sing of Iseult. [Tristan moves away, she follows. For if I may not pluck the fruit, And may not catch your music for my harp, Nor open up my grief . . . a little help me! Help me a little! Twenty times a day You would pick up my missal, bind me flowers, Put by a tress of my hair. Is that forbidden? Then, on my knees, I supplicate, companion My hours with something of your thought. Tristan. I journey . . . And, listen, I adventure life and limb To night that Kahedin, our best beloved, Should rescue or embrace The lady who so long has wasted for him, Who now is wasting. Pray for Kahedin. Iseult of Arundel (with anger). For you! Tristan. No, I am damned. Open your thoughts To Kahedin. . . . Take as your sister, if she needs a refuge, The lady that he loves. Open your thoughts. [Looking back at her defiantly. Can you not prayânot with these cursed, white hands? Iseult of Arundel. My handsâI plunge them in the blackberries: I will not stain them with a harlot's touch. Tristan (more defiantlyâsinging). La dame chante doucement, La voix s'accorde Ã  l'instrument, Les mains sont belles . . . Is that the song, Iseult? [Exit. Scene IV Arundel Castle. A passage by the door into Tristan's chamber Iseult of Arundel, with a small dog, leans against the partition Kurvenal enters Iseult of Arundel. No, Kurvenal! Kurvenal. But I am older than your tart refusals; And my dear Master So strangely sick, I will have access to him . . . Wounded and venomedâsick to death! This stillness Has nothing of the heaving up and down In the air where there is breathing. Iseult of Arundel (listening). There is breath; Have patience, Kurvenal. My brother watches. Kurvenal. The lad he calls his brother! He forgets To call me servant, and I am his servant; But poets never keep the truth of names. If you knew all! [He moves away: she listens more intently. Iseult of Arundel. Tristan is speaking loud. I have missed something, but . . . Hush, Petit Cru! . . . He speaks so loud and clear, I shall know all. [She lays her head against the door for a long while. The voices now are still, and Petit Cru Is quiet at my feet. I cannot stir, I cannot move . . . I am as a dead bird that rocks and swings, Nailed to its gibbet. It were good to pass Within the chamber . . . [She shakes her head. Petit Cru, the door Will open, and thy master call for thee. I will not suffer it: though he may call, Thou shalt not be caressed of him again. I am quite alone. All love himâ Kahedinâ I am a little thing to stand alone! Scene V A chamber at Tintagel. It is grown dark Gradually Iseult is seen seated on one of two thrones upon a dais. She is looking out to sea. Sudden gleams from the low sunset strike in. King Mark enters and sits beside her Mark. You keep your state, Queen, to a wailing wind. Iseult. I had not missed you. I keep my place perpetual by your throne Enthroned. It is your pleasure. Mark. You look out? Iseult. Is that forbidden? If there be a sail This winter time the sea-gull stretches it. Mark. Iseult! Iseult. I know There is a feast to-night. Mark. The gallery Will crowd with minstrels. Iseult. I would hear no musicâ No harping more! . . . The small brown-feathered birds, Flecked, of flecked songâthe siskin and the merle, The intimate warm creatures of the wood That peck at blossoms! . . . Hide your face from me! Mark. Why do you love the forest? Is it sweetâ Give me your hands and press mine as you speakâ Is it that there your heart was innocent? You grip my hands. Ah, then I can forgive. Iseult. I never can forgive. Mark (with sudden passion). Then hear my newsâ Tristan is married. Do you smile, Iseult? So those a battle smites will blanch and smile. Tristan is married and at Arundel Lives with his wife, Iseult of the White Handsâ Why do you lay yours forth upon your robe?â In love and honour, for men say this woman Is chaste and of great faithfulness. Iseult. Say more, Tell all . . . not with your comment, with detail . . . What feast was made for Tristan, what the wine, And who was drunken; with what wreath of myrtle Or flower or fruit his bride enlaced her hair; What largesse was outpoured and how he kissed her Before the people? You shall have my pardon If you will give me regal entertainment, And sting my interest in the tale you tell. I have lived far from ballads, quite shut off From any minstrel. I should love a story Of Tristan and Iseult. My hands are fresh, And shine across the blood in them as shells. More of the story! [Falling back. But it has no power; Not in the rumour, Not in the vision, for you cannot frame it To haunt me even: it but flits along, A thin and wasted fancy on your voice. Ha, ha! You would provoke a little mirth, A little laughter from me. Mark, remember, While I am laughing, how as Tristan is So is Iseult of Ireland, so King Markâ Married as Tristan. We are married, Mark. [He supports her head. After closing her eyes for a while, she uncloses them. A dream! A dream! Why should you tell me of your dreams? So Tristan Has won a wife? Have you no other dream? Mark. Yea, verily I have another dream. Tristan is married: you are desolate. But I have loved you night and day and night Again. Now you are fallen, still I love you, I see you fair. Beloved, If I might suck you up, even as the sea Sucks up some crazy little bark that tears Against its waves, to haven it below In its unfathomed waters! [Iseult slowly rises and disengages herself from Mark. Iseult. Peace! No more! Let all the dreams be mine! Away!âNo more! [He leaves her with a heavy sigh. That I might drink of death! Death has the secrets That grow from the roots of sleep: Would I might drink Before the wedded woman, drink, and dash The goblet at her feet. Iseult!âHe dare not Mellow the tempest of that name, with magic Of his low voice, to her. Iseult! Iseult! [Perceiving Brangaena at the doorway. Ho, I am calling to myself, Brangaena; My name is like some awful monument, Some temple on the sands I cannot pass, And yet it is no use to me. I can But pray that it will crush me with its stones. Iseult! [She laughs again. I often heard my mother tell Of the immense, wide Afric gods, and wondered If they had wrought the worlds . . . But I forget! Tristan is married. Brangaena. Yea. Iseult. Then Mark has blabbed? Brangaena (shaking her head). I heard it on the shore. Iseult. News, news! A vessel Over the waves under the walls? Brangaena, Is Tristan married? Brangaena. There are merchant-men Hid in the shingle-cave. They offer silks . . . If presently They may bring in their wares! [Iseult motions they may enter. It is a vesselâ Think but of that. If I have any craft In secret it shall speed you to Sir Tristan. O child, the sailing! You shall see his face. [Exit. Iseult. It is a dream. I take it up again With slumbering senses. Tristanâdoes he come? Is he a merchant-man? Disguise, disguise! Tristan once more. O Love, but straight and clear Let him come to meâTristan! Re-enter Brangaena with Kahedin and others disguised as merchant-men These are strangers. Unroll your silks. It is an empty hour. Unroll, display your trafficking. [Sheets of silk, tinted in beautiful colours, are opened by two merchant-men and laid before her. Kahedin lifts up a goblet and shows Tristan's ring on his hand. Kahedin. Of Tours! Iseult (seizing his wrist). You have a message. Kahedin (terror-struck). Noble Queen, believe We come here very humble, in distress, With silks, with treasure, and with many riches. Iseult. You come here with my ring. Then he is dead, Tristan is dead? It is a goodly cup You lifted in that glittering handâof Tours, You said, a cup of Tours. Is this the message? And did he drink of it, your lord, Sir Tristan? Has he bequeathed it to me? For I know, I have known all the day that he is dead. Kahedin. Dying, great Queen, and dying for your love. Iseult. O merchant-man, you have a vulgar tongue! Be dumb at least, give no interpretation. If you are charged to yield the jewel up, Lay it aside . . . and put with it the goblet, These Spanish things, the silk. I will weigh down Your vessel with their price: it is my message. Brangaena, give him gold . . . And for this wine To crown the cup with. Kahedin. Lady you mistake. I am no merchant; I am Kahedin, And brother to Sir Tristan. Iseult. You would say That you are brother to Sir Tristan's wife, Iseult of the White Hands? Kahedin. I had forgotten Sir Tristan has a wife, or I a sister That may be called Iseult. You have the name, You breathe it. O fair blondeness of the land, My lord Sir Tristan is laid nigh to death: But have compassion of his singing eyes, That sing for you across the western sea. Iseult. What help is in the seaâso alien It is, so bitter and so girding cold? Has he forgottenâ Kahedin. All that is not you. Rejecting tendance, as the tide flows in, Borne on a litter to the beach, he waits For hours and counts the waves as they were hours, And sees them ebb away, nor will he miss In any wind the rushing of these waves That rush from Cornwall. Iseult. Wherefore should he die? Kahedin. Lady, this is my grief. He perilled life Guarding a tower wherein I met my love: Her husband slew him with a poisoned arrow . . . Except you heal him he will surely die. Iseult. Is this the message? Kahedin. Of the golden hours He bade me to remind you, of your love, Of his first sickness, of your mother's love, And of a magic draught upon the sea: Also he bade me to salute this maiden, If she is named Brangaena. Iseult. All the magic, All, all the spoiling of the magic rests With this Brangaena. Take the maid with you; She knows my mother's simples, is a nurse, And will recover you your lord. O Boy, Why do you stand there trembling at my feet? Kahedin. He said Nothing that I have saidâthat was in sleep Or wandering fever, with his eyes bent on me Fading and darkening slowly as they faded: That was in weaknessâ [He goes to the table, takes the ring, kisses it, and repeats. âGreet her: all the greetings I have I send to her. I keep back nothing Of comfort to myself.â Iseult (settling the ring on her finger). Brangaena, take The brightest of the silks, That one, the vermeil-gold. This is your sail, Sir Kahedin. We will unclose these eyes Of your sheathed falconâgallantly will steer Into your port. Your ship shall burn like fire, Like sunrise on the waves. Kahedin. My lord will live. Iseult. For I shall bear to him such joy, such tidings; For we will take this cup, And all the vintage back. The wine is strong For dying lipsâno matter! [She laughs as she unrolls and lifts in her arms a sheet of the red-gold silk). Hoist the sail! Scene VI Arundel: a terrace rimming the sea with its parapet, closed at one side by a round tower, at the other by a bold cliff, jutting out into the sea. Iseult of Arundel stands on the top of the cliff at watch. Iseult of Arundel. How I am weary, watching through the nightâ A sentinel, lone sea-bird!âfor a sail Watching, and for the colour of a sail. Oh, in the dark There comes a little respite from my cares, My sight being covered, and the sounds I hear So gentle and of motion Like a caress, and like the passing-over Of a loved hand even as one falls asleep! But now it is the dawn, the stars such lamps They look as they would fall into the sea: And the great night-clouds pile. Kurvenal enters Kurvenal. Lady, Sir Tristan Asks record of the night? Iseult of Arundel. How fares Sir Tristan? Has there been sleep? Kurvenal. The change as when a diver Is lost and reappears. Once in the night I prayed that I might call you to his bedside. He shook his head and answered, âShe will come.â Iseult of Arundel (seizing his arm). More record! Speak! Kurvenal. I said, âThe dawn breaks cold; for pity's sake Let me draw in our Lady from her watch: She will be chilled to death.â âIs it so cold at sea?â He answered. âDoes the cold make it so long?â Then heavily his head fell on my neck; Nor could I break from him. Iseult of Arundel. Say that the night Was cold, as I have seldom known the stars Blazon its cold: say that the night was long; And even now it moves As it were scarce worth while to move aside, So soon it will have business with the clouds, And pressure of a day that cannot break. Kurvenal (looking round to a clear point of light in the East). The words . . . your words! Iseult of Arundel. Say all The words I give you as you say his words. The rest be secret from you! [Exit Kurvenal. [Gradually an even daylight prevails, and a fleet of boats turns the point of the cliff. Lo!â They are come home, the small brown fisher-boats From the night's toil! The wives Of these poor fishers have had quiet rest; And now they stir themselves within their houses, And stir the children. . . . Presently the lads Will crawl down to the beach and help the fishers Pull up the boat . . . the wife will shade her eyes, And give her husband welcome at the door. My recordâwhen again Kurvenal comes to seek meâmy true word: âThere is no sailâ . . . only this little flock Of the brown fisher-boats returning home. (Yawning.) How cold I am, How sick of keeping record! Oh, it stifles! . . . The sea so very still, And very straight the line against the sky, As sometimes I have seen it drawn in books; While the day, coming gravely, promises Continuance of itself. If the day wear Silver and even to its close, and slowly He drops down from his longing as a bird Faint to its nest to die . . . still I am witness. It stifles! . . . I would bring his fate down on him, Upgathered in my hands. Would he were dead, As safely dead as the eternal Kings Encoffined in the centre of the earth! [While she has pierced the verge Tristan has been borne in by Duke Jovelin and Kurvenal. She hastens down to him. Tristan. No, pass within!â Iseult of Arundel. Your sentinel! . . . Tristan. The watch Is changed: I give you rest, Iseult. [He lays his hand out for her to caress. Farewell! [Iseult, without fondling him, passes to the tower, but pauses: over the top of the cliff for an instant a golden sail heaves into sight, lit by the risen sun; then it is lost behind the cliff. Iseult. The watch is changed! [She gazes at the sail and goes within the tower. Tristan. Father . . . a fancy! . . . sisters! I see them in procession, two and two Pass to the Ark . . . and those that are not mated Must pass alone. Duke Jovenal. Dear son . . . Tristan. I must be parted from your grief; it haunts me. Keep her within! [Duke Jovenal goes away, weeping. Tristan strokes Kurvenal's hand. Now I am dying, all I need is some one prompt to answer me, Whatever it is in my heart to ask. Kurvenal. But give me some command, something to do After . . . if you are dying! Tristan (raising himself). Kurvenal, I would be buried with my foster-parents Deep inland, buried where the grass spreads flat, Wild and neglected. I would be forgotten. Kurvenal. But I shall visit you. Tristan. The bees will visit! It is my willâdeep inland. Kurvenal. Think!â It may be that the Queen will come, and then? Tristan. Oh, to and fro they pass, the many ships, Kurvenal, to and fro: it does not matter; For none have any haven. Kurvenal But some message! You are thinking of your many voyagesâ If she should come too late? Tristan. Farewell, farewell: Death in its open letters Will front her with the word. Now let me be; For I must take last parting from myself. . . . It lingers and it hurts. [He remains quiet; Kurvenal paces. Kurvenal. He suffers, oh, he is suffering in the wilderness of this air, breathing in a waste! The breath wells up of itself. And a sea is stretching glassy to his face. There is no sail across itâthere cannot be! And he does not ask for a sail; he gives no heed. So his mother lay with him beside her in her agony, and did not fondle her babe any more. He is sinking away into infinite night, and heeds neither time nor light nor darkness. [Suddenly bending over Tristan. But this is darkness that one cannot wake: And the sea's wavering tremor palpitates, In vain . . . the tide is coming upâit stretches Over the sand. . . . He loved the rising tide . . . But though the dawn be shining, Arundel Is dark for everâloud be her lament! Tristan (in a murmur, with closed eyes). âWould I were dead upon my Irish coast, Dead on my shore!â . . . The great refrain That is my passing bell! She cannot come! Are not our merchants sailing back to me With the silk bales and treasure? I perceive Now in the dawning that she cannot come; That she is sitting by King Markâas lonely As fellow-Sphinxes guarding a great stair, Indifferent to those that pass within, To those that pass without. [Kurvenal has raised his head and watches intently an emergent gold sail. Would we had diedâ The only cup that we can ever drink To overtake the cup of Destiny, And spread its balm upon the bane! Not now, I would not now that she should come! . . . To leave her Upon these ignorant and savage coasts . . . There must be no more meeting now, Nor parting any moreâonly the dark To creep up to our spirits as a tide; And quiet graves for usâthere must be graves, Where we shall rest in quiet. [Kurvenal is now beside Tristan, smiling down on him. Kurvenal. Wake, revive! The ship is at the beach. Tristan. You see her, Kurvenal? Kurvenal (at the edge of the balcony). Close, close I see her . . . and the cup of Tours Is in her hand: she is most glorious In crown and purple robes. Tristan (his hands tight over his eyes). Go, Kurvenal, within! Let none salute the Queen . . . stretch wide the door. [Waving his hands despairingly. Keep them within! I cannot bear the tumult. She should have worn disguise, she should have come In secret as a magic healing Power, Or as a leper, or an anchorite. . . . O Kurvenal! See that none look upon her. . . . Turn the helm, Turn the helm backward to the Irish coast, Back to her mother. . . . [Kurvenal goes out: Tristan lies in swoon. After some moments Iseult of Ireland enters with Kahedin. Merchants behind her leaving spices and a flask of wine. Kahedin. Queen, but he is passed! Iseult. No, no! Not dead; he is not dead . . . [She kneels by him. He tarries, And cannot die more than a king expectant For news of a great battle. . . . Tristan, Tristan! Listen! I streamed The sail in calm as a wide bannerole, Held wide before a host . . . By night I burned it red with torches: day and night The sail has been assured; the sail rose up Before the land . . . Tristan, the sail rose up! Kahedin. Oh, he is passed! Iseult (more desperately). No, no! And if he wereâI could arouse the dead. . . . Tristan . . . as if I called you from the woods, Tristan . . . as if I called you from the sea, Tristan . . . as if you heard me from Tintagel, Striving amid the gulleys. . . . Tristan, Tristan! [He opens his eyes. I am come . . . Iseult! Tristan (faintly to Kahedin). The ship is in the port? . . . The ship! For you will bear her home? . . . And all will be, Beloved, as it had never been! [In a voice of triumph. How firm The jewels dartle from her crown! [Iseult, with a shriek, falls prone across the foot of the bed. Oh, save her! See, they are pressing in. . . . Re-enter, at the sound of the shriek, Iseult of Arundel her father, Kurvenal, and a crowd of servants Kahedin (to his sister). Keep back, hold back! Iseult of Arundel. But I will be the mirror To take the last stain of his breath. . . . What hinders? [Dragging back Queen Iseult by her hair. Dead, dead! Is this his hope?â A crown fallen off Amid the meshes of long, golden hair! Duke Jovelin. Peace, child . . . peace, peace! His soul is on the verge; Let it put forth in peace! [He violently snatches his child to his arms: the golden hair of Queen Iseult, still held in Iseult of Arundel's hand, is spread out wide; sunlight falls on it. Tristan (fixing his eyes on it, as on a golden sail). The ship! . . . . [He dies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE The Minster Church of Arundel Tristan and Iseult are laid out side by side before the altar. Iseult is covered from sight under her golden sail. Iseult of Arundel, in black weeds, stands beside the bier King Mark, with Brangaena, Kurvenal and a train of Cornish Nobles, advances through the mourning people, past Duke Jovelin and Kahedin, straight to the corpses. He stands for a long interval before Tristan, then turns to Iseult of Arundel Mark. Open your heart to me; and have no fear. I make no claim on anything. My palace, Strong on Tintagel's rock, fades twice a year Before my sight: I have seen all things pass. Iseult of Arundel. Take her away! Mark. But they must lie together. I dare not sever them in death, I dare not. Here let them rest. I bade Brangaena tell you, As she has poured into my ears, the tale How they drank wine together, wine her mother Had steeped in wizard passion of her prayers: The hands that bore the draught were hands of Fate: These the appointed lips, these, these!â (He looks long into Tristan's face; then turns again to Iseult of Arundel). O child of Arundel, There is one freedom that we kings must grantâ We must not intercept the arrow's flight; We must not dam the river from the sea; And when the eagle swoops above our flock We must remember him the bird of Jove. Iseult of Arundel. Remove them from me; bear the dead away! Mark (leading her to Tristan). See, the face softens! [She struggles to speak. Child, no more confession. The face is softeningâthat is all our peace. There shall be at Tintagel royal tombs, Set but a little way apart. A rose, Tristan, for theeâa rose to stretch itself In briars and angry branches and great falls Of blossom on the neighbour tomb. A vine . . . Ah, so I dream the fairy monument; I can no longer dream. Brangaena, straight Unveil your mistress! [She unwraps Iseult of Ireland, and her beauty spreads like incense through the Minster. The people instinctively kneel and fall to prayer, burying their faces: but Mark remains standing, and as he looks at the two lovers, now resting side by side in transfigured beauty, the words escape his lips. Pray for us! [A long triumphant strain of music thrills the air; then a fanfare is heard; and the long, triumphant strain of music passes upward out of the church to be lost in the air of heaven.</field>
