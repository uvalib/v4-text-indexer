      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —Interior of a Besieged City—Troops discovered defending it—As the curtain rises an assault is being made—Cannon. Espardo, Allebardo, Arquebusado, and Officers. Solo and Chorus—“Sturm March.” Louder the thunder storm of battle roars! Down, down, down upon the foe it pours; Faster the whistling bullets on them rain. Bang! bang! blaze away again, again! March and form, and charge and wheel, Spare for neither shot nor steel. Talk of Concerts, Promenades, Here's the true “Sturm March,” my blades; Here the Band and here the Ball, Makes, at least, more noise than all! Enter at Flourish, King Fulminoso and Soldiers. King. Bravo! brave army! very much bravo! Thrice have we beaten back the haughty foe! Thrice hath he striven here his foot to fix, And by his motion thrice has taken nix! Esp. But still we weaker grow, instead of stronger, And can't keep on a-beating him much longer, King. I'll fight till off my bones the flesh is hacked! Hang those that talk of fear! Esp. If when they're whacked, The fools don't know it, and for mercy sue, What's to be done? King. Why, whack 'em till they do! Open the gates, and let us make a sally Upon the rogues, before they've time to rally! Queen., Prin. (without) Stop! stop! King. What cry was that? Esp. Methought the squalls Of female women! King. Ha! within these walls, My wife! my child! by what event untoward? Oh now, indeed, I feel I am a coward! Enter Queen and Princess. My Dulcibella! Queen. Oh! my Fulminoso! To risk your life I will not let you go so! Can't you look on, as other monarchs do, And see your subjects fight? Ah! why should you Expose yourself to all those horrid things, That pay no sort of reverence to kings; But would as quickly crack your precious crown As knock a little duck-legged drummer down. Let scores of little duck-legged drummers fall, It is their business, but not yours at all! Prin. If you are deaf to dear mamma's appeals, See, at your feet your only daughter kneels! (kneels) Cut while you can this cut-throat occupation, And join at once the Peace Association. King. Come, Mars, and case my heart in threefold buff, Or both my ears with thy gun cotton stuff! Prin. Father! King. Away! Queen. (kneeling) Husband! King. Arise! Queen. No! never. Here on our knees we'll both remain for ever! King. For ever! Queen. Yes! for ever and a day— Unless you melt. King. To melt's to run away, And Fulminoso wasn't born to fly. I couldn't do it! Queen., Prin. If you'd only try! (alarm—Cannon) Esp. My liege, the enemy again advances! King. Ha! then in gentle force my only chance is. Tear us asunder—with the greatest care! Prin. I faint! Queen. I ditto. (falling into the arms of Officers) King. Hence my treasures bear, To the strong tower upon the forest borders, And keep them safely there till further orders. (Officers bear out the Queen and Princess) King. Now to the field, and give the foe no quarter; Be bricks, my boys, and never mind his mortar! Air—King—“Guillaume Tell.” Follow your leader, boys, to-day; Soon they shall find 'tis no boy's play; Into the foe we'll soundly pitch, Gentlemen all, behave as sich. I am for deeds, and not for speeches, To the assault come on who dares; They who attempt to mount our breaches, Hang me if I would be in theirs! Follow your leader, boys, to-day, &amp;c. (Exeunt King, Officers, Soldiers) Scene Second. —A Forest—Thunder, lightning—A crash heard without—Attendants fly in terror across the stage. Enter Queen and Princess. Queen. Ah, me! misfortunes never come alone! Forced from my husband, fighting for his throne, Caught in a dreadful storm we fly for shelter Into this fatal forest helter-skelter; Scared by the lightning, off the horses bolted, Upset our coach, and out we both were jolted! And now deserted here are left to die, Or be some horrid monsters eaten by. Prin. To meet that fate I should not be so loth, If the same monster would but eat us both. Queen. Affecting proof of my sweet child's affection, And which removes a part of my objection. Air—Princess—“Are you angry, Mother.” Are they hungry, Mother, oh, oh, oh, oh. Is't the hour they peckish grow? Oh, oh, oh. When I see their teeth so white— When I think how they can bite— I into my shoes shall shrink, And the heart within me sink! Horrid monsters, why can't they Just on one another prey When they're hungry, as we find Creatures do of human kind! Prin. But are there really wild beasts in this wood? Queen. So I have generally understood. Lions and tigers, panthers, bears and boars, And all sorts of fierce creatures on all fours— Fiercer than any great Van Amburgh knew, Or Gordon Cumming ever said he slew. But whether serious such report, or jocular, Our demonstration's likely to be ocular. (Roar—The head and fore-paws of a Lioness are seen through an opening among the trees) Prin. Ocular! Oh, look yonder, mother, see! Two fiery eyes that glare on you and me! Queen. A lioness! She will come out next spring. We'll die together! (clasping Princess in her arms) Music—The Lioness disappears, and in its place is seen Leona, the Enchantress, attired in a wild but splendid dress, with the skin of a lion on her shoulders, and armed with a bow and quiver of arrows. Leo. You'll do no such thing At present. Queen. Wonder takes away my breath! Leo. You are condemned to something worse than death. I am the Fairy Lioness—my name Leona. Nightly through this wood for game, I hunt, and when I catch such birds as you, I bear them thus my brazen caverns to. (music—Scene changes to Scene Third. —The Brazen Caverns of the Enchantress in the centre of the earth. Leo. Here for your lives you shall remain my slaves! Queen. Such conduct is more brazen than your caves. Leo. Ha! you are bold indeed, to break a jest, At such a moment—none, too, of the best, But you'll have time a better here to make; Behold the monsters guarding yonder lake Of quicksilver. Queen. And guard it well they may, Or from such frights 'twould quickly run away! Leo. They were all mortals once, with forms like thine, Kings, queens, and princes—enemies of mine, Besides a score or two of dames of fashion Who had for lion hunting such a passion, To any foreign brute they'd go their knees on, Provided he was newly caught that season; Nay, any donkey could their favour win, Who wore by accident a lion's skin. Just Fate the Fairy Lioness enables, To turn upon them their own supper tables, And make them grin and tumble, bray and roar, As they made other monsters do before. Queen. I never lionised a creature. Leo. No! Therefore no change of form you'll undergo, But dress my dinner, and your daughter there Shall be my lady's maid, and dress my hair. Queen. I dress your dinner! I ne'er learned to cook. Leo. But you will soon. I'll lend you Soyer's book. Prin. I dress your hair! Leo. I wear it very plain, And when a lioness I have no mane. Queen. But— Leo. But! no buts! or I'll make butts of you, And with these arrows pierce you through and through, And yet not kill! Go you, cook, to your kitchen, And you, (to Princess) come make a witch look more bewitching! Trio—Leona, Queen, and Princess—“We met.” Leo. We met, 'twas in a wood, And you strove both to shun me. Queen. I felt I couldn't move, For your eye was upon me! Prin. You spoke, my blood ran cold, As your deep-toned voice uttered— Leo. Come, come, you don't perceive, On which side your bread's buttered. If well you dress my hair, (to Princess) I may not often beat you. Improve my bill of fare (to Queen) And perhaps I mayn't eat you. To work yourselves betake, And without any pother, Or your bones I will break (to Princess) And pick those of your mother. Queen &amp; Prin. All hope we must forsake, And our feelings must smother, Or your/my bones she will break, And pick those of your/my mother! (Exeunt Leona and Princess) Queen. From bad to worse! when will my misery end, Since fate forbids e'en death to be my friend? Cook to a lioness! what degradation! Without the power to change my situation. No wages either! nothing but the run Of that black kitchen, wherein hope is done To rags, and leaps with desperation dire Out of the frying-pan into the fire! Air—Queen—“My lodging is on the cold ground.” My lodging is all under ground, Where I can't get a peep at the sky, And there's no one to help, I'll be bound, “Help” ever so loud should I cry. In a mess on a railway as vainly might shout, Some poor, pent-up, desolate elf, For, whatever the danger, he couldn't get out, Or alarm any one—but himself. (the croak of a raven is heard) Sure, 'twas a raven's boding croak I heard, (Raven appears on rock) Yes, yonder perches the ill-omened bird! What has he in his talons? a poor frog, Which he has evidently prigged for prog! I'll strive to save it from the ravenous raven! (takes up a stone and flings at Bird) Drop that! you great black, ugly, croaking craven! (music—The Raven drops the Frog and flies off) He has! but it came down with such a flop, I fear, poor frog, you've taken your last hop. Frog. No, I'm all right! a thousand thanks to you. Queen. It speaks! Frog. Of course when I am spoken to. Queen. Did you come out of Æsop's Fables? Frog. No! Queen. Are you the frog that would a wooing go? Frog. Nay, I'm a lady frog, and mustn't woo, Save in Leap Year. Queen. They're all leap years with you. Excuse me, heaven knows I've no heart for joking. Frog. Well, though a frog, I'm not much given to croaking, And would assist you, as I feel your debtor. I'm a half fairy, my name's Grenouilletta. Queen. Half fairy! Well, when hope's so nearly dead, E'en half a fairy's better than no bread. Frog. My power has limits. Queen. Like Don Ferdinando, Perhaps you can do no more than you can do? Frog. Exactly, but in what I can you may Command me, for your generous act to-day. Queen. Oh, then restore to my dear husband's arms Me and my child! Frog. I fear Leona's charms Are yet too potent, but I'll go and find The magic wreath, which I have left behind In an unlucky moment, or that raven Could not have borne me from my peaceful haven. (Exit Frog) Enter Princess. Prin. Oh, mother, we are in a pretty pickle! Our dreadful mistress would her palate tickle With some new dish, and fancies—ope your eyes!— Naught but a vol au vent of butterflies! I am to catch 'em. Where, 'tis hard to say; For not a butterfly e'er flew this way. And you're to cook them, which will be still harder To do if there be not one in the larder. Queen. And if not done? Prin. She threatens torments fearful! Our cup of woe, she hints, is not yet near full. Queen. I've not a word left to throw at a dog, My only hope is in my friend the frog! Prin. Your friend the frog! wonders will never end, Where did you pick up such a funny friend? Queen. A raven picked her up. I made him drop her. Grenouilletta re-appears in a female form, but preserving the colour of the frog in her dress; she has a wreath of roses on her head. Gre. It was for luck you gave that bird a topper. Queen. Grenouilletta! Gre. I've my crown on now. Queen. And much more like a fairy look, I vow! Gre. Behold, I bring you what will glad your eyes, A swarm of beautiful fat butterflies. (butterflies appear) Attracted by my wreath of magic roses, Have hither followed their unhappy noses; Fling over them your veil, (to Princess, who flings the veil over them, then places butterflies on rocky bank) Now with a song, We'll see if we can make a vol au vent. Concerted Piece—To its own Air. Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man, Make me a patty as fast as you can, Make it, and bake it, and serve it up clean, And there'll be a vol au vent fit for a queen. (during the song the Princess withdraws the veil, and the vol au vent appears on a handsome dish) Gre. Promises are like pie-crust, made to break, But I to keep my promise, pie-crust make. Prin. A patty made in pity of our plight! Queen. My heart still pit-a-patty goes with fright! Leo. (within) What ho! my slaves. Gre. Leona comes this way! At hop and hide 'twere prudent I should play. (Exit) Enter Leona. Leo. Well! is my dinner ready? Queen. As you wish; I was just going to bring up the dish. (takes it off bank) Leo. (taking it) As I'm a Fairy Lioness of taste, Delicious butterflies, and fine puff paste! And you professed you naught of cooking knew! Why, I declare you're quite a Cordon bleu! While dainties such as these you can produce, To eat you I should be indeed a goose. Its savour makes me hungry, I declare! I'll in and take the Lioness's share. Air—Leona—“O what pleasure.”—“Midas.” O what pleasure will be mine, On this dainty dish to dine! There's no richer pie, Than a butterfly, Made of Emperors fat and fine. (Exit with dish) Queen. Saved for the present—but she soon will learn, I'm scarcely cook enough a spit to turn. Prin. We can't expect a frog so kind and clever, To stay and do the cooking here for ever. Enter Grenouilletta. Gre. No, but I'll tell you what the Frog will do, Hop off the brave King Fulminoso to, Whom by this time his foes have ceased besieging. Queen. Would you be so excessively obleeging? Gre. I will, and all your story to him tell; 'Tis he alone, I find, can break the spell; If he love you enough the deed to dare. Queen. If he do not, then I don't wish him—there! Gre. Scratch him a line upon this leaf, to shew (gives leaf) I've your authority—your hand he'll know. Queen. (writes) 'Tis done! Oh! most beneficent of Frogs I fear upon you we're a pair of clogs. Gre. Not in the least; such work to me is play. 'Twill be a game of leap frog all the way. (Grenouilletta descends through stage) Prin. If she should change her mind upon the road! Queen. She wouldn't be such an ungrateful toad! Duo—Princess and Queen—“A frog he would.” Prin. This Frog she would the journey go, Heigho, says Rowley, Whether my mother would let her or no, With her rowley, poley, Gammon and spinach, Heigho, says Anthony Rowley. Queen. Off she set with her opera wreath, Heigho, says Rowley, Which she look'd remarkably well beneath. With her roley, poley, &amp;c. Prin. If she finds my pa at home, Heigho, says Rowley, Through fire and water to us he'll come, With his rowley, poley, &amp;c. Queen. But oh, if inclined on a sovereign to sup, Heigho, says Rowley, The Lioness sees him and gobbles him up! With his rowley, poley, &amp;c. Prin. Then there'll be an end soon to you, ma, and me. Heigho, says Rowley, And I wouldn't give much for the little Frogee, With her rowley, poley, &amp;c. (Exeunt) Scene Fourth. —Chamber in Fulminoso's Palace. March—Enter Fulminoso, Espado, Allebardo, Arquebusado, and Guards. Air—King—“When great lords and ladies”—“Tom Thumb.” Lo, King Fulminoso, To strains pomposo, Crowned with laurels hither comes! 'Midst triumphal marches, Triumphal arches, Bells and bonfires, guns and drums! Yet Fulminoso, Feels rather so so In spirits far from high, Like that sad person, Major Macpherson, He sighs, but can't tell why! But what though flat I chance to be Care killed a cat, But shan't kill me, King Fulminoso 's beat all his foes so, Care at Jericho he means to see. King. Now is the winter of our discontent, Made glorious summer by this great event; And all the clouds that lowered on our house, Gone to the bottom of the ocean—souse! But what though victory our arms have crowned, What though we've given our foes a drubbing sound, What though in triumph we have thus marched home, What though the good time coming now seems come, Still there is something wanting to our joy, Still in our happiness is some alloy. What is it that so weighs upon our soul? Puts out our pipe, and bitter makes our bowl? Can any one remember any thing We have forgotten? Esp. Most victorious King, I nothing know of consequence—unless The absence of the Queen and the Princess. King. (starting) Can it be? yes! no! ah! it must! how rum! My wife! my daughter! why of course! “them's-um!” Quotation from a well-known American anecdote of a similar lapse of memory in a passenger by steamboat, who, having landed his luggage, could not recollect what other property he had left on board. They are the lumps of sugar that I miss, When to my lips I'd raise the cup of bliss! They are the stars I lack at close of day, When I would blow a cloud of cares away! Why haste they not to hail our glad return? Esp. Alas! great sir, sad news have you to learn. King. Sad news? speak quickly! you my heart appal! Esp. We haven't got no news of 'em at all! King. No news is good news—how can that be sad, Which, if not good, at least cannot be bad. On with thy tale. Esp. Alas, my tale is ended. They went over the bridge. King. And the bridge bended? Esp. No, on their journey they were safely started, But ne'er arrived. King. Lost! stolen! strayed! Esp. Departed, If not deceased, with all the folks that followed them, Either the wild beasts or the earth has swallowed them. King. Oh! Alle. The King swoons! Esp. The colour flies his cheek! Alle. Take comfort, sir! King. Of comfort no man speak! Let's talk of undertakers and their bills— Prohibit further sale of Parr's life pills. Let's sit upon the ground, and tell strange stories Of ghosts and bogies, and phantasmagories— Of kings and queens, who've been by wicked fairies, Once on a time, played all sorts of vagaries— Of sad princesses, left without a rag on, To be devoured by a frightful dragon— Of others off by fiery griffins carried Against their wills, to dwarfs or giants married, All wretched. Esp. Nay, sir, some found food for laughter, And almost all lived happy ever after. King. I'll hang the slave who dare my face before Talk about being happy any more! None in my kingdom, east, west, north or south, Shall laugh, save on the wrong side of his mouth. As for myself, floored by this blow so cruel, I'll starve upon the thinnest water gruel, Moistening with sorrow's heavy wet my clay, Till down my dust with my own tears I lay. Enter Antirumo. Ant. Ha! ha! ha! ha! King. That traitor seize for one, And hang him instantly! (Espado seizes him) Ant. For what? King. For fun! Which is a grave offence against our laws! Ant. You won't pass sentence till you've heard the cause. It would have made a cat laugh, or a dog; I'm bid to crave an audience for a frog! King. A frog! Ant. That talks like any rhetorician, And comes in state upon a special mission. King. From whom? Ant. Her Majesty the Queen. King. She lives! Ant. She does. King. New life to me that sentence gives, And I revoke the one I passed on you. (Espado releases him) Admit the envoy with all honour due, Gladly we'll hear the news this frog's to tell come, And all the world may laugh again, and welcome! Air—King—“Whipsy diddlesey.” We'll in state receive the Frog, Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin! To hear it speak I'm all agog, With a harum scarum diddlecumdarum, Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin. Bandy legs and yellow hose, Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin! A flounder's mouth, and never a nose, With a harum scarum, &amp;c. Such a figure of fun can ne'er be meant, Whipsy, diddlesey, dandelin! Any monarch on earth to represent, With a harum scarum, &amp;c. And yet though at first it makes one stare. Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin! To see a frog Chargé d' Affaires, With a harum, scarum, &amp;c. The charge may be less on the public purse, Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin! And affairs be devil a bit the worse, With a harum scarum diddlecumdarum, Whipsy, diddlesy, dandelin! (Exeunt King, Officers, and Guards, dancing) Scene Fifth. —Hall of Diana in the King's Palace—Statues of Diana and her Nymphs on pedestals. March—The Frog is brought on in a palanquin borne by four Frogs, and attended by other Frogs richly attired and bearing golden bulrushes—Enter King, attended. King. You bring us tidings of our consort dear, Speak, gentle Frog—for you can speak, I hear. Gre. (under palanquin) First, mighty King, we pay our reverentials, And secondly, deliver our credentials. (Page (Frog) hops to King, and delivers the leaf on which the Queen has written) King. My Dulcibella's hand! There's no mistaking The precious pothooks of my darling's making. (reads) “Dear husband, this comes hopping”—hopping! well, Of course it did—“that you will break the spell. Excuse the spelling, and all faults you've found, As I'm in haste, and scratching underground.” How underground? Explain this wondrous riddle! Is not my Queen on earth? Gre. No, in the middle. King. The middle of the earth! Who dare consign her To such a pit? My Queen is not a minor, Whate'er my daughter is. Ah! say, my other Darling—is she as deep as her dear mother? Gre. Yes, they are both down in the world at present,— A situation very far from pleasant. The centre of the globe. King. In Leicester Square? An exhibition of the terrestrial globe on an immense scale in a building specially erected for it in the centre of Leicester Square. See Mr. Buckstone's “Voyage Round the Globe” (Vol. V.) Gre. No, the great globe itself. King. Frog! have a care! Great as my wonder is at your garrulity, If you o'erstep the bounds of my credulity, Out of my kitchen my French cooks I'll call, And have a fricassee made of you all! (music—The Frog disappears, Grenouilletta rises from palanquin) Gre. Indeed! how say you now? we fairy elves Much better than French cooks can dress ourselves! Is this dish to your taste, or would you wish That I, in turn, you and your Court should dish? King. By no means, fair and most illustrious Fairy, In every sense—plenipotentiary, Your Excellency none would dare to doubt. But tell me, how am I to set about Bringing my wife and daughter up to town? Gre. To fetch 'em have you courage to go down? If so, assist you in the work I can. King. I dare do all that may become a man— A married man—a husband—and a father! Who dares do more is none! Gre. That's plucky, rather. So take this ring. King. A plain one of pure gold! With such a ring a man may make too bold Who has a wife already. Gre. Fear you not, That will but lead you to the wife you've got. Of wedded love the type, in a true hand, No sorcery its magic can withstand. The Queen and Princess touch with that fond token, And the vile spell will instantly be broken. King. On this adventure I'm in haste to go— Which is the road? Gre. Your faithful ring will shew. (stage opens) King. Ha! the earth opens at my feet! Gre. No doubt That's the way in. King. Humph! which is the way out? Gre. Do you retract, upon consideration? King. Not I—I merely asked for information. Gre. Down to the centre of this earthly ball There are ten thousand steps. King. I'll take them all! Gre. A lioness will spring upon you. King. Let her! Gre. She may change to a woman. King. All the better! Gre. In either shape, a fury you will find her. King. I'll make her fancy Old Nick is behind her. Gre. Go on and prosper then! the spell destroy, And e'en these statues here shall dance for joy. King. I'm sorry that to see them I can't stay, But don't let that prevent you—dance away! (music—King descends—Stage closes over him—Grenouilletta touches the statues on either side of the stage—they become animated) BALLET. END OF ACT FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —The Foot of the Giant's Staircase of Ten Thousand Steps leading to the Centre of the Earth. Enter Leona. Leo. Accursed fate! I feel 'tis near the hour Which tolls the knell of all my magic power. Close on me follows the undaunted King, Guided and guarded by his golden ring. Against this most invulnerable male, My magic arrows are of no avail. I made a sad mistake, in bringing down To this estate the partner of his crown. But who could have conceived a cara-sposo, Was to be found on earth like Fulminoso? Since Orpheus for his wife went to the deuce, The custom's fallen quite into dis-use; And if to take such journeys men are prone, It is for other wives—and not their own. He comes! and makes me tremble, I confess, Both as a lady—and a Lioness. (retires into cavern) King Fulminoso enters. King. This way the noise was! Monster, shew thy mug! If thou escapest me by some humbug My wife and daughter's ghosts will haunt me still. Where is this Lioness that I must kill? She that's the beast and beauty rolled in one, For such an one am I to fight, or none! Enter Leona. Leo. Behold her! but I will not fight with thee! King. Then yield! and to that great menagerie Which fashion flocks to in the Regent's Park, The Zoological Gardens. I'll send thee 'mongst the monsters there of mark; Soon to put out of joint with belles and beaux, The hippopotamus's ugly nose. I'll have it advertised in all the Press, “Here may you see the Fairy Lioness!” Leo. I will not yield to be a Sunday show With any hippopotamus I know. Though you have come to my hall door, vile King, Not only with a knock, but with a ring; Still will I try the last—lay on, you muff, And hang me if I don't yet work your buff. (they fight) Duo—King and Leona—“German Polka.” Leo. Strike a female unprotected, Who such usage had expected? See a warrior's sword directed, 'Gainst a woman in distress. King. To my gallantry appealing, Let me as a man of feeling, Beg you'll take the blows I'm dealing, Only as a Lioness. Leo. Ugh, you wretch, I'll scratch your eyes out! King. There, indeed, the woman flies out. Come! peccavi who first cries out, Shall be—what I won't express. Fight or fly, one thing or t'other, I've no time for all this pother. Leo. You're a monster! King. You're another! So have at you, sorceress. Leo. Come to the scratch, ye monsters of the lake, Of this foolhardy mortal mincemeat make. Music—Leona rushes off; various monsters issue from the cavern and attack the King—He beats them off. Re-enter Leona. Leo. His ardent spirit is all proof above! What if assailed on the weak side of love? I'll raise up with her never dying snakes, The green-eyed monster jealousy—which makes The meat she feeds on! She shall act her part, And try to stab this husband to the heart; If in that point invulnerable found, I've no hope left above, or underground. Re-enter King. Besotted mortal! why these perils dare For one who long hath ceased for thee to care? By other homage for thy loss consoled, A favoured lover in her arms behold! Scene Second. —The Rocks open, and discover a Crystal Tower, in which the Queen is seen embracing a young Prince. King. My Dulcibella false! I'll not believe My eyes, which you may by your skill deceive. My heart assures me she is no such thing— And I shall know the false coin by the ring— (chord) (stretches out his hand with the ring towards the Castle, and the Prince immediately changes to the Princess) My daughter! a fair rival! (rocks close) Leo. Fiends! confusion! King. True love can not be duped by such delusion, Release them, sorceress, thy arts are vain, Leo. No! still some fragments of my power remain. (music—The scene draws off, and discovers Scene Third. —The Quicksilver Lake. Leo. Pent in that crystal castle, they shall float On yon quicksilver lake as in a boat. Thy ring must touch it, ere the crystal break. (music) Shift, silver, shift—thus I my last shift make. (Exit) (music—The King goes to rock and endeavours to touch Castle —it glides to the opposite side—King crosses stage and tries to touch it there—it then glides back again) Trio—King, Queen, and Princess—“O Pescator.” King. Of this false lake to get the middle in, The way to know I'd give a lot o' tin, My brains in vain I spin, Though a most mercurial hero, Till the quicksilver's at zero, I cannot go in to win. Queen and Princess. We're sick of sailing this glass vessel in, It keeps so disagreeably wabble-ing— Our heads around quite spin, Can't you find some way, O dear, O, We feel really very queer O, Bottled up like beer or gin! Queen. Dearest of husbands! tell me how d'ye do? King. Not much the better, love, for seeing you In that glass case. Prin. Or rather, this glass slipper. King. A cunning craft, which acts as its own skipper, Queen. If, as the proverb says, all things give place When but a single lady's in the case, Surely politeness should as far be carried When there are two—one single and one married. And yet through all the pains I've had to pass, I've found none harder than this pane of glass. King. It is indeed a painful exhibition To which there is no getting an admission At any price. Enter Dragon. Dra. Come, how much would you stand, If I should give you now a helping hand? King. A helping hand! why, looking at its claws Before I take it I must beg to pause. Dra. Well, I'll propose the terms then, if you like, And you may or may not the bargain strike, I'll bear you to that castle on my back; And you shall get your friends out in a crack, If when the spell is broken you'll give me That ring, which then to you will useless be. King. I will. Dra. Upon your honour? King. Shining bright. Dra. Up with you, and sit fast! King. Go on, all right. (Exeunt King and Dragon, and re-enter Dragon with King on his back, whom he swims with to the Castle—The King touches the Castle with the ring—The Castle, lake, and mountains vanish, and the King, Queen, Princess, and Dragon are left in Scene Fourth. —The Gardens of the Palace. King. My wife, my life, my love, my everything! Dra. Sorry to trouble you, but— King. Oh! the ring. 'Tis yours immediately—a thousand pardons. Queen. (looking about her) Why, I declare! they're our own palace gardens. Dra. Yes! you're at home, and I feel quite so too. King. We're so obliged to you, I hope you do. Queen. Would you take anything to eat or drink? Dra. Well, as you're so polite, I will, I think, But I am rather dainty in my feeding, Queen. As should become a dragon of good breeding. King. Whate'er I can command—flesh, fowl, or fish, I pledge my word to gratify your wish; So call for what you like. Prin. Oh! yes, pray do. Dra. Then, Princess, shortly I will call for you. (music—Puts ring on her finger, and exit) Prin. For me! what can the hideous monster mean? King. I've not the slightest notion, have you, Queen? Queen. I have a horrid notion that the creetur Means he will either marry her or eat her. King and Prin. Marry! Queen. That ring he's on her finger stuck. Prin. And I can't get it off again—worse luck. King. He wouldn't surely to her hand pretend! I've no objection to him as a friend; But as a son-in-law, the thing's absurd, Not to say monstrous. Queen. Monstrous is the word! If he should call, we must all be denied. Prin. I'd rather be his bride cake than his bride. Queen. He cannot have his cake and eat it too. King. I can't imagine he would either do. If he propose, he'll meet with a rebuff; And as to eating, that's of course all stuff. Queen. What! when to grant his wish your pledge is fresh, Whether it be for fish, or fowl, or flesh! King. He'd never snap at hasty words like those. Queen. He'd snap at anything on earth he chose. King. Let's drop the subject for these subjects loyal, Who haste to greet their Queen, and Princess Royal. Enter Lords, Ladies, Officers, &amp;c., and Antirumo. Ant. Your Majesties have in most happy time Returned, for hither from a distant clime Comes an ambassador. King. The Frog again? Ant. Oh! no, sire,—one of quite a different strain, With a proposal from Prince Nonpareil For the Princess Carissima. King. À merveille! Into our presence straight the envoy shew. (Exit Antirumo) Proposal could not come more apropos; What luck! My dear, you know Prince Nonpareil. Queen. By name, of course, my love, exceeding well. Of great King Pippin he's the eldest son; And of all persons, just the very one A parent for his daughter would pick out From all the heir apparents round about. King. (to Princess) I hope he'll to our daughter's liking prove. Prin. “I'll look to like, if looking liking move, But no more deep will I endart mine eye, Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.” King. That girl talks like a book! Queen. Beyond all praise, One seldom hears such language now-a-days. King. Behold the envoy! Enter Prince Nonpareil, attended, introduced by Antirumo. Prin. Heavens! what do I see? Prince Nonpareil himself. What he? Bless me! Prince. Discovered! then away with all disguise. Princess, a captive to those wondrous eyes, Which have my heart and mystery pierced through, I kneel, my own ambassador to you. King. A stranger thus at the first sight to guess, The gift of second sight she must possess. Queen. A clairvoyance, which makes uncommon shady Madame Robin and the Mysterious Lady. Duo—Queen and Princess—Ophelia's Song in “Hamlet.” Queen. O, how could you his Highness know, From any other one? Prin. By his portrait; to him, though, They've scarcely justice done! “To-morrow is St. Valentine's Day.” I saw it last St. Valentine's Day, In the Fairy Pictorial Times, And I thought, of all men, I should like him best, To be my Valentine. Queen. Then all your duty and your complaisance, Was but a copy of your countenance. King. And that fine speech about your eye endarting, Only your eye and Miss Elizabeth Martin. Prince. Nay, chide her not, if you approve her choice. Queen. Oh! in your favour, sir, you've every voice. Prince. Then, as a pledge of union, deign, sweet fair, On this white hand a union pearl to wear, Richer than that which ten successive kings, In—ha! what have we here? Talking of rings, What ring is this—so like a wedding one— Upon your wedding finger? Prin. (aside) I'm undone. King. (aside) Confound the Dragon! Queen. (aside) How can this be parried? Prince. I'm on the rack; are you already married? Queen. No! in the garden some one must have dropped it, My daughter found, and on her finger popp'd it. King. Just slipped it on. Prince. Then slip it off again. Prin. I would with pleasure, but I've tried in vain. My finger's swollen round it, but I hope Before the day's out— Queen. Try a little soap! King. If that won't do, why, we must get a file, And file it off. But come, in the meanwhile, Let us be merry. Ho, there! music! wine! (Exit Antirumo) This very day the contract we will sign. (King, Queen, Princess, and Prince sit—Four Attendants with wine and refreshment) Enter Antirumo. Ant. My liege! my liege! King. How now! what means this panic? Have you beheld his Majesty Satanic? Ant. Something that's put me in a fright as great. There is a giant, sir, outside the gate! King. With all my heart. He may remain outside. Queen. Don't let him in! Ant. I couldn't if I tried. There is no gate which, even on all fours, He could creep through. King. And wherefore at our doors At such a time impertinently knocks he? Ant. The Princess he is come to wed by proxy. Prin. Wed me! King. By proxy! Queen. (aside) In my shoes I shake! Prince. Proxy for whom? Ant. The Dragon of the Lake, Who says, if for his rib he cannot win her, He'll come and pick her bones to-day for dinner. Queen. I told you so! Prince. Explain this fearful mystery. Queen. Learn of this magic ring the fatal history. To this vile Dragon 'twas a promised gift, For having given his Majesty a lift, When in great need of one, I'm bound to say, But such a trick with it as this to play Is conduct which I do consider really, As even for a dragon much too scaly. Prin. I'd sooner die than form such an alliance! Prince. (to Antirumo) Fling in his teeth Prince Nonpareil's defiance. King. Not so! if fighting might the matter settle, Of Fulminoso none can doubt the mettle. But, oh! I pledged my royal word to grant Of fish, fowl, flesh, whatever he might want; And though not fish nor fowl, she is a specimen Of flesh and blood that deeper makes the mess I'm in. (the Giant appears over the tops of the trees) All. The Giant! (all exeunt in terror except the King, Queen, Prince, and Princess) Giant. Holloa, there! it's getting late! Pray, how much longer am I here to wait? Queen. You must excuse a little hesitation; Just put yourself, sir, in our situation. How should you like to see your daughter clawed up, By a fierce dragon, to be chained or chawed up? Giant. I never had a daughter, so can't say. King. You have no children, butcher! go away. Giant. Not till I get an answer, “yes” or “no”! Is that young woman coming for to go? Or do you mean I'm to go for to come Back with my lord, the Dragon Fee-Fo-Fum! King. How shall we answer? Prin. Sir, let me reply. To save your honour I'm content to die. I am not bound to be the Dragon's wife. Your promise gives him power but o'er my life. Return, huge monster, to thy treacherous lord, Say that King Fulminoso keeps his word— That I, his daughter, scorn to make excuses, And he may come and eat me when he chooses. Giant. Prepare, then, for to-night on you he'll sup. King. Heroic girl! (Giant disappears) Queen. And she'll be gobbled up! King. Before our eyes! Queen. And we have got no other! King. What a sight for a father! Queen. Or a mother! King. Oh! full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife. Prince. Is there no way to save her precious life? Queen. No friend to help us? Music—Grenouilletta rises. Gre. Yes, one friend most true, Though you've forgotten me, I haven't you. Queen. Grenouilletta! oh, I blush for shame. King. The Frog! I feel I'm awfully to blame. Queen. Deep as we are already in your debt, Prove you forgive, although you don't forget. Gre. I come to do so, for in helping you, I helped myself more than I thought to do; The Fairy Lioness's spell destroyed, I gained the power she before enjoyed. No longer a half fairy, be it known, I take full elfin rank in Queen Mab's own, Vice Leona, now dismissed her service. King. My heart spins round like any dancing dervise. Gre. First from this maiden's hand I pluck the ring, (taking it from finger of Princess) By fraud placed there, through your rash promise, King. Now mark my words. When strikes the witching hour In which we fairies have the greatest power, The Princess to the marshy valley lead, And send the Dragon word to come and feed; That act performed your honour bright secures; If he don't eat her, that's no fault of yours. Queen. If! Can there be an “if?” Oh, then, if so, There is much virtue in an “if,” we know. Gre. Prince Nonpareil, you would her champion be? Prince. Against the world! Gre. Then through it follow me. Air—Fairy—“Follow, follow o'er the mountain.” Follow, follow, of this planet But the surface here you see; You will find the world more hollow Than you'd fancy it could be! In my subterranean lodgings, All the depth of it you'll sound; And the Dragon's artful dodgings, Deep enough be to confound. Follow, &amp;c. (Exeunt Prince and Grenouilletta, King, Queen, and Princess following) Scene Fifth. —The foot of the Giant's Staircase, &amp;c. (same as First Scene of this Act) Enter Grenouilletta and Prince down staircase. Prince. Where are we? Gre. In the centre of the earth, Where all its hidden wonders have their birth; The Fairy Lioness's ancient seat, Now my abode. Prince. No doubt a snug retreat; But rather dull, and if I may say, dingy. Gre. The former occupant was quite as stingy As she was wicked. I shall have it burnished As bright as day—each chamber newly furnished, And with conservatories, baths and dairies, Make it a model lodging-house for fairies. But to our present business. In that cupboard, Which once belonged to Mother Bunch or Hubbard, (I'm not quite certain which, it's so long back,) You'll find the arms with which immortal Jack, Made shorter by so many heads the giants; The sword of sharpness and the cap of science, The coat of darkness and the shoes of speed. Prince. To fight the Dragon just the things I need. (opens door and takes them out) The shoes of swiftness to the spot will take me, The fairy coat invisible will make me; So that while he can't see to take my measure, I'll poke him up and cut him down at pleasure. Gre. Also a phial, which contains a juice, That can a transformation strange produce. Prince. 'Tis here. But who the change must undergo? Gre. Put on your cap of knowledge, and you'll know. Prince. (putting on cap) Ha, bless me, why this Dragon, Fee-Fo-Fum, Is— Gre. Not a word at present. Prince. Ma'am, I'm mum! For I perceive why, though a potent elf, You couldn't settle this affair yourself. Gre. It was impossible. Prince. Of course, because— Gre. Hush! till in death you've locked the Dragon's jaws. Then to the public you may give the key Of this impenetrable mystery. Duo—Fairy and Prince Nonpareil.—“What fairy-like music.” Fairy. In fairy-like fashion I've armed you to be The champion of her you would die to set free; Away to her rescue—the foul Dragon flog, With a hop, skip, and jump, in three leaps of a frog Prince. A fairy like you sick of flattery must be, And need no fine speeches from mortals like me;. Think I've said all I should say, and hence let us jog, For I can't stoop to toady a fairy or frog. (Exeunt Grenouilletta and Prince Nonpareil opposite sides) Scene Sixth. —The Marsh—Stump of Tree in centre— Enter Two Officers, Guards, Princess, King, Queen, and Attendants, &amp;c. Queen. This is the spot, the middle of the marsh, Here stands the stump to which, by sentence harsh, In honour we are bound this lamb to bind, Poor, poor lost mutton! Prin. Mother, I don't mind. I am prepared the heroine to play; Remember Perseus and Andromeda; Or the fair Sabra and St. George! indeed 'Tis plain, for aught that I could ever read, Could e'er by tale or history discover, The course a dragon never yet walked over, To walk off with the stake of a princess, But either he got into some great mess, Or else was stuck through body, bones and gristle, Or else his head cut off, clean as a whistle; Or if there was one thing on earth that nettled him, More than another—it turned up and settled him. King. She is as wise as brave, she's given us hope enough To hang the Dragon, let us give her rope enough. (they bind her to the stake) Where shall we stand the dread result to note? Queen. “Upon a mountain's top, the most remote And inaccessible, by shepherds trod—” King. (aside) To tread what's inaccessible is odd. Queen. We'll stand to see what fortune out will shell, And so one last embrace—and then, farewell. Concerted Piece—King, Queen, Princess, and Court—“French Air.” King. Yes, farewell, for we must go. All. Oh! King. Say good-bye to your papa! All. Ah! Queen. And to fill the cup of woe— All. Oh! Queen. Bid adieu to your mamma. All. Ah! King. Should the Dragon win the day! All. Eh! King. And you down his gullet go, All. Oh! King. Dearest child, I hope you may— All. Eh! King. Choke him, ere you get too low, All. Oh! (Exeunt King, Queen, and Court) Prin. They've tied me to the stake, I cannot fly; The Dragon can though, and will soon be nigh; But in the Frog I trust, as heretofore; My Nonpareil is sound, too, to the core. Both at their post will be in time, I know, And with two such good heartstrings to my bow, I fear no more this Dragon than the people In Cheapside fear the one on Bow Church steeple! Methought I heard a noise—perhaps the Frog Is here already at her post, incog. Scena—Princess—“She wore a wreath of roses.” She wore a wreath of roses My sight when first she met; A face so sweetly smiling No frog had ever yet. She said with much politeness And in the softest tone, That she'd return with grateful heart The kindness to her shown. Well, this is just the moment, I wish I could see her now, With that wreath of magic roses Upon her fairy brow. “Zampa.” But let that still, Be as it will, My Nonpareil will guard from ill His Princess dear, So naught I fear, But thus the Dragon dare! “Cymon.” Come on, come on, I dare you to come on! I dare you! I dare you! I dare you to come on! Enter Dragon. Dra. Oh! you do, do you? Prin. Ah! (screaming) Dra. Then why these cries? Prin. Nay, if you take a body by surprise. Dra. I take a body any way or how, When I'm as hungry as I am just now. So down the red lane, as the children say, You go directly. Prin. Help, Frog, while you may! Music—Prince Nonpareil, wearing the invisible coat, and bearing the sword of sharpness, enters, and catches hold of Dragon's tail. Dra. Furies and fire, who's pulling at my tail? Prince. If you desire to know, Prince Nonpareil. Prin. It is his voice, but I can't get a sight of him. Dra. No more can I, or I'd make but one bite of him. Prince. But you shall feel me. There, and there, and there. (cutting and stabbing him) Dra. Oh, I'm an undone Dragon. Mercy! spare My life, and take my money. Prince. Monster, no! Go where all wicked dragons ought to go. (the Dragon falls and dies—The Prince flings off his coat, and appears to the Princess, whom he releases) Victoria! my love again is free. Prin. Victorious, my love again I see! Enter King and Queen. King. Hurrah! hurrah! you polished him off neatly. Queen. Never was dragon cut up more completely. King. You've pierced his waterproof great-coat of scale through, And made a hole that you might drive the mail through. Prince. Ah, I forgot, I've not done with him yet, There is a male out through that hole to let. Prin. What marvel next? Prince. Come forth, thou magic phial, Thus of thy potent charm I make one trial. (sprinkles the contents on the body of Dragon, and Prince Lizardo rises out of it) Liz. And, to my great relief I'm free to say. Queen. A handsome youth! where did you spring from, pray? Liz. Out of that Dragon's hide, wherein I led A horrid life for one well born and bred, Compelled, to serve a wicked Fairy's ends, To live—I blush to say—upon my friends. Restored to habits now that more befit me, I mean to live for them—if they permit me. Prince. Although prepared, of course, for this event, It gives me wonder great as my content, To see you here before us. Enter Grenouilletta. Gre. I've no doubt But the whole secret now may be let out. This is the Prince Lizardo, who, one day, Fell in the Fairy Lioness's way; And, for he wouldn't doat the cruel hag on, She turned him into that detested Dragon! King. Ah! I suspect—Prince! you're a lucky dog! To you our friend is not cold as a Frog! Gre. Well, I confess, sir—spare a fairy's blushes— Here, as the Emperor of all the Rushes, I hope to crown him. Scene changes to Last Scene. —Nuptial Bowr of the Queen of the Frogs. Prin. See! where from them springs A fairy palace! King. With two dragon wings. Gre. Enter in triumph! Queen. Softly there, my friend! That must on other sovereign powers depend. King. For such a plunge this pit may be too deep, A frog like you should look before you leap. Queen. (to audience) “Do as you would be done by,” is a rule As golden as was ever taught at school. King. Let the Frog save us, as we tried to save her. Queen. By jumping here, at once, into your favour. Finale—“Green grow the rushes, O.” Prin. Remove our cares with kindly hand, And view whatever passes O, In this our mimic fairy-land, But through good-nature's glasses O. Come here in masses O, Patrons of all classes O; And fill our rows to overflows, With merry lads and lasses O. Queen. When all the world shall crowding be, The monster Exhibition O, Form Monster Meetings here to see Our Monsters in addition O! French, Yankee, Russian O, Swiss, Dutch, and Prussian O, Come fill our rows to overflows, And never mind the crushing O. King. Let no stern critics us poor frogs Come, like King Stork, to diddle O; Be nice, good-natured, dear King Logs, And play “frog in the middle” O! Ri tol de riddle O, We'll sing, and dance, and fiddle O; Come fill our rows to overflows, All round and down the middle O. CURTAIN.</field>
