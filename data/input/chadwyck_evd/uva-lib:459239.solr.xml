      <field name="fulltext">The louer not beloued. Lo syr, who so that loketh here for curtesy And seth me seme as one pretendyng none But as vnthought vppon thus sodenly Approcheth the myddys amonge you euerychone And of you all seyth nought to any one. May thynke me rewde perceyuyng of what sorte ye seme to be, and of what stately porte. But I beseche you in most humble wyse To omytte dyspleasure and pardon me My maner is to muse and to deuyse So that some tyme my selfe may cary me My selfe knowyth not where, and I asure ye So hath my selfe done nowe, for our lorde wot where I am, or what ye be, I knowe not. Or whence I cam, or whyther I shall All this in maner as vnknowen to me But euyn as fortune guydeth my fote to fale So wander I, yet where so euer I be And whom or howe many so euer I se As one person to me is euerychone So euery place to me but as one And for that one persone euery place seke I which one ones founde I fynde of all the rest Not one myssyng, and in the contrary That one absent, though that there were here prest All the creatures lyuyng most and lest yet lackyng her I shulde and euer shall Be as alone syns she to me is all And alone is she without comparyson Consernyng the gyftys gyuyn by nature In fauour fayrnes and porte as of person No lyfe beryth the lyke of that creature Nor no tonge can attayne to put in vre Her to dyscryue, for howe can wordes expres That thyng the full wherof no thought can ges. And as it is thyng inestymable To make reporte of her bewty fully So is my loue towarde her vnable To be reportyd as who seyth ryghtly For my soole seruyce and loue to that lady Is gyuen vnder such haboundant fashyon That no tonge therof can make ryght relashyon. wherin I suppose this well supposed Unto you all, that syns she perceyuyng As much of my loue as can be dysclosed Euyn of very ryght in recompensyng She ought for my loue agayne to be louyng For what more ryght to graunt when loue loue requireth Then loue for loue, when loue nought els desyreth But euyn as farre wurs as otherwyse then so Stande I in case in maner desperate No tyme can tyme my sewt to ease my wo Before none to erely and all tymes els to late Thus tyme out of tyme mystymeth my rate For tyme to bryng tyme to hope of any grace That tyme tymyth no tyme in any tyme or place. wherby tyll tyme haue tyme so farre extyncte That deth may determyne my lyfe thus dedly No tyme can I reste alas I am so lyncte To greues both so greate and also many That by the same I say and wyll veryfy Of all paynes the moste incomparable payne Is to be a louer not louyd agayne. The woman belouyd not louyng entreth. Belouyd not louyng. Syr as touchyng those wordes of comparyson whiche ye haue seyd and wolde seme to veryfye If it may please you to stande therupon Hearyng and answeryng me pacyently I doubt not by the same incontynently your selfe to see by wordes that shall ensue The contrary of your wordes veryfyed for true. Louer not loued Fayre lady pleasyth it you to repayre nere And in this cause to shewe cause reasonable wherby cause of reformacyon may appere Of reason I muste and wylbe reformable Louyd not louyng well syns ye pretende to be confyrmable To reason, in auoydyng circumstaunce Brefely by reason I shall the truthe auaunce. ye be a louer no whyt louyd agayne And I am louyd of whom I loue nothyng Then standyth our question betwene these twayne Of louyng not louyd, or louyd not louyng which is the case moste paynfull in sufferyng wherto I saye that the moste payne doth moue To those belouyd of whome they can not loue Louer not louyd. Those wordes approued lo, myght make a chaunge Of myne opinion/but verely The case as ye put it I thynke more straunge Then true, for though the belouyd party Can not loue agayne, yet possybly Can I not thynke, nor I thynke neuer shall That to be louyd can be any payne at all. Belouyd not louyng. That reason perceyuyd and receyuyd for trouth From proper comparyson sholde clere confounde me Betwene payne &amp; no payne, no such comparyson growth Then or I can on comparyson grounde me To proue my case paynefull ye haue fyrst bounde me To which syns ye dryue me by your denyall Marke what ensueth before ferther tryall. I saye I am louyd of a certayne man whom for no sewt I can fauour agayne And that haue I tolde hym syns his sewt began A thousand tymes but euery tyme in vayne For neuer seaseth his tonge to complayne And euer one tale whiche I neuer can flee For euer in maner where I am is he. Nowe if you to here one thyng euery where Contrary to your appetyte sholde be led were it but a mouse lo sholde pepe in your ere Or alway to harpe on a crust of bred Howe coulde you lyke such harpyng at your hed Louyng not louyd. Somewhat dyspleasaunt it were I not deny Louyd not louyng. Then somewhat payneful as well seyd say I Dyspleasure and payne be thynges ioyntly anext For as it is dyspleasaunt in payne to be So it is paynefull in dyspleasure to be vext Thus by dyspleasure in payne ye confes me wherby syns ye part of my payne do see In my ferther payne I shall nowe declare That payne by whyche with your payne I compare. Smale were the quantyte of my paynfull smerte yf hys iangelynge percyd no further then myne erys But thorough myne erys dyrectly to myne harte percyth his wordys euyn lyke as many sperys By whyche I haue spent so many and suche terys That were they all red as they be all whyte The blood of my harte had be gone or thys quyte And almoste in case as though it were gone Am I except hys sewt take end shortely For it doth lyke me euyn lyke as one Shold offer me seruyce most humbly wyth an axe in hys hande, contynually Besechynge me gentylly that thys myght be sped To graunte hym my good wyll to stryke of my hed I alledge for generall thys one symylytude Auoydyng rehersale of paynes partyculer To abreueate the tyme and to exclude Surplusage of wordes in thys our mater By whyche ensaumple yf ye consydere Ryghtly my case at lest wyse ye may see My payne as paynfull as your payne can bee. And yet for shorter end put case that your payne were oft tymes more sharpe and sore in degre Then myne ys at any tyme yet wyll I proue playne My payne at lenght suffycyent to match ye whiche profe to be true your selfe shall agre yf your affeccyon in that I shall resyght May suffer your reason to vnderstande ryght you stand in plesure hauyng your loue in syght And in her absens hope of syght agayne Kepyth moste tymes possessyon of some delyght Thus haue you oft tymes some way ease of payne And I neuer no way for when I do remayne In hys presens, in dedly payne I soiorne And absent, halfe ded in feare of hys retourne Syns presens nor absens absenteth my payne But alway the same to me is present And that by presens and hope of presens agayne Ther doth appere myche of your tyme spente Out of payne, me thynke this consequent That my payne may well by meane of the length Compare with your shorter payne of more strength Louer not loued. Maystres if your long payne be no stronger Then is your longe reason agaynst my shorte payne ye lacke no lycklyhod to lyue much longer Then he that wolde stryke of your hed so fayne yet lest ye wolde note me your wordes to dysdayne I am content to agree for a season To graunt and enlarge your latter reason Amytte by her presens halfe my tyme pleasaunt And all your tyme as paynefull as in case can be yet your payne to be most, reason wyl not graunt And for ensample I put case that ye Stood in colde water all a day to the kne And I halfe the same day to myd leg in the fyer wolde ye chaunge places with me for the dryer Loued not louyng. Nay that wolde I not be ye assuered Louer not loued. Forsoth and my payne aboue yours is as yll As fyre aboue water thus to be endewred Came my payne but at tymes and yours contynue styll yet shold myne many weys to whome can skyll Shewe yours, in comparyson betwene the twayne Skantly able for a shadowe to my payne Felt ye but one pang such as I fele many One pang of dyspayre, or one pang of desyre One pang of one dyspleasaunt loke of her eye One pang of one worde of her mouth as in yre Or in restraynt of her loue which I requyre One pang of all these felt ones in all your lyfe Sholde quayle your opinyon and quench all our stryfe which panges I say admytted short as ye lyst And all my tyme besyde pleasaunt as ye please yet coulde not the shortnes the sharpnes so resyst The percyng of my harte in the lest of all these But much it ouermacheth all your dysease For no whyt in effecte is your case dyspleasaunt But to deny a thyng which ye lyst not to graunt Or to here a sewter by dayly peticyon In humble maner as wyt can deuyse Requyre a thyng so standyng in condyshyon As no porcyon of all his enterpryse without your consent can spede in any wyse This sewt thus attempted neuer so long Doubt ye no deth tyll your payne be more strong Nowe syns in this mater betwene vs dysputed Myne admyttance of your wordes notwithstandyng I haue thus fully your part confuted what can ye say nowe I come to denyeng your pryncyple, graunted in my foresayeng which was this, by the presens of my lady I graunted you halfe my tyme spent pleasauntly Although myne affeccyon ledyth me to consent That her selde presens is my relefe onely yet as in reason appereth all my torment Bred by her presens and marke this cause why Before I sawe her I felt no malydy And syns I sawe her I neuer was fre From twayne the greatest paynes that in loue be Desyre is the fyrst vpon my fyrst syght And despayre the nexte vpon my fyrst sewt For vpon her fyrst answere hope was put to flyght And neuer came syns in place to dyspewt Howe bryngeth then her presens to me any frewt For hopeles and helpeles in flames of desyre And droppes of despayre I smolder in fyre These twayne beyng endeles syns they began And both by the presens of her wholly Begon and contynued, I wonder if ye can Speke any worde more, but yelde ymmedyately For had I no mo paynes but these, yet clerely A thousande tymes more is my grefe in these twayne Then yours in all the case by which ye complayne Loued not louyng. That is as ye say but not as I suppose Nor as the treuth is, which your selfe myght se By reasons that I coulde and wolde dysclose Sauyng that I see such parcyalyte On your parte, that we shall neuer agre Unlesse ye wyll admyt some man indyfferent Indyfferently to heare vs, and so gyue iudgement. Louer not loued. Agred, For though the knowledge of all my payne Ease my payne no whyt yet shall it declare Great cause of abashement in you to complayne In counterfet paynes with my payne to compare But here is no iudge mete, we must seke elles where Louyd not louyng. I holde me content the same to condyscende Please it you to set forth and I shall attend. Here they go both out and the louer belouyd entreth with a songe. Louer belouyd. By comen experyence who can deny Inpossibylyte for man to showe His inward entent, but by sygnes outwardly As wrytyng, speche, or countena?ce, wherby doth growe Outwarde perceyuynge inwardly to knowe Of euery secrecy in mans brest wrought Fro man vnto man the effecte of eche thought These thynges well weyd in many thynges shewe nede In our outwarde sygnes to shewe vs so that playne Accordyng to our thoughtes/wordes and sygnes procede For in outwarde sygnes where men are sene to fayne what credence in man to man may remayne Mans inwarde mynde with outward sygnes to fable May sone be more comen than c?mendable. Much are we louers then to be commendyd For loue his apparence dyssembleth in no wyse But as the harte felyth lyke sygnes alway pretendyd who fayne in apparence are loues mortall enmyes As in dyspayr of spede who that can myrth deuyse Or hauyng graunt of grace can shewe them as morners Such be no louers but euyn very skorners. The true louers harte that can not obteyne Is so tormentyd that all the body Is euermore so compelde to complayne That soner may the sufferer hyde the fury Of a feruent feuer, then of that malady By any power humayne he possyble may Hyde the leste payne of a thousande I dare say. And he who in louyng hath lot to suche lucke.

These two exsamples by ought that I se Be no thyng the thynges that any thynge touch me with deth of my chylde my beyng contented Or payne with my frende wyllyngly assented Is not contentacyon voluntary For that contentacyon cometh forceably But my contentacion standeth in such thyng As I wolde fyrst wyshe if it went by wyshyng Louer loued. Syr be ye contented euen as ye tell yet your contentacyon can nother excell Nor be compared egall to myne estate For touchyng contentacyon I am in rate As hyely contented to loue as ye se As ye to forbere loue can wyshe to be Had I no more to say in this argument But that I am as well as you content yet hath my parte nowe good approbacyon To match with yours euen by contentacyon But contentacion is not all the thyng That I for my loue haue in recompencyng Aboue contentacyon pleasures felyng Haue I so many, that no wyght lyuyng Can by any wyt or tonge the same reporte O the pleasaunt pleasures in our resorte After my beyng from her any whyther what pleasures haue we in commyng to gyther Eche tap on the grounde towarde me with her fote Doth bathe in delyght my very harte rote Euery twynke of her aluryng eye Reuyueth my spirites euen thorowoutly Eche worde of her mouth not a preparatyue But the ryght medicyne of preseruatyue we be so ioconde and ioyfully ioyned Her loue for my loue so currantly coyned That all pleasures yerthly the treuth to declare Are pleasures not able with ours to compare This mouth in maner receyueth no food Loue is the fedyng that doth this body good And this hed dyspyseth all these eyes wynkyng Longer then loue doth kepe this harte thynkyng To dreame on my swete harte, loue is my feader Loue is my lorde, and loue is my leader Of all myne affayres in thought, worde, and dede, Loue is the Christs crosse that must be my spede No louer nor loued. By this I perceyue wel ye make rekenyng That loue is a goodly and a good thyng Louer loued. Loue good what yll in loue canst thou make apere No louer nor loued. yes I shal proue this loue at this tyme ment here In this mans case as yll as is the deuyll And in your case I shall proue loue more euyll what tormentry coulde all the deuylles in hell Deuyse to his payne that he doth not tell what payne bryngeth that body those deuyls in that hed which mynysters alway by loue are led He frysyth in fyre he drowneth in drought Eche parte of his body loue hath brought abought where eche to helpe other shulde be dylygent They marter eche other the man to torment without stynt of rage his paynes be so sore That no fende may torment man in hell more And as in your case to proue that loue is wurs than the deuyll my meanyng is this Loue dystempereth hym by torment in payne And loue dystempereth you as farre in ioy playne your owne confession declareth that ye Eate, drynke, or slepe euyn as lyttell as he And he that lacketh any one of those three Be it by ioy or by payne clere ye see Deth must be sequell howe euer it be And thus are ye both brought by loues induccyon By payne or by ioy to lyke poynt of dystruccyon which poynt aproueth loue in this case past Beyonde the deuyll in turmentry to haue a cast For I trowe ye fynde not that the deuyll can fynde To turment man in hell by any pleasaunt mynde wherby as I sayd I say of loue styll Of the deuyll and loue, loue is the more yll And at begynnyng I may say to yow If god had sene as much as I say now Loue had ben Lucyfer and doubt ye no whyt But experyens nowe hath taught god such wyt That if ought come at Lucyfer other then good To whyp soules on the brech loue shalbe the blood And sewer he is one that can not lyue long For aged folke ye wot well can not be strong And an other thyng his phisicyon doth ges That he is infecte with the blak iawndes Louer loued. No ferther then ye be enfecte with folye For in all these wordes no worde can I espye Such as for your parte any profe auoucheth No louer nor loued. For profe of my parte, no but it toucheth The dysprofe of yours for where you alledged your parte aboue myne to be compared By pleasures in which your dyspleasures are such That ye eate, drynke, nor slepe, or at most not much In lacke wherof my tale proueth playnly Eche parte of your pleasure a turmentry wherby your good loue I haue proued so euyll That loue is apparauntly wors then the deuyll And as touchyng my parte there can aryse No maner dyspleasures nor tormentryes In that I loue not, nor am not loued I moue no dyspleasures nor none to me moued But all dyspleasures of loue fro me absent By absens wherof I quyetly content Louer loued. Syr where ye sayd and thynke ye haue sayd wel That my ioy by loue shall bryng deth in sequell In that by the same in maner I dysdayne Fode and slepe, this prouerbe answereth you playne Loke not on the meat, but loke on the man Nowe loke ye on me and say what ye can No louer nor loued Nay for a tyme loue may puffe vp a thynge But lackyng fode and slepe deth is the endyng Louer loued well syr tyll such tyme as deth approue it This part of your tale may slepe euery whyt And where ye by absent dyspleasure wolde Match with my present pleasure ye seme more bolde Then wyse, for those twayne be farre dyfferent sewer No louer nor loued. Is not absens of dyspleasure a pleasure Louer loued. yes in lyke rate as a post is pleased which as by no meane it can be dyseased By dyspleasure present so is it trew That no pleasure present in it can ensew Pleasures or dyspleasures felyng sensybly A post ye knowe well can not fele possybly And as a post in this case I take you Concernynge the effecte of pleasure in hande now For any felyng ye in pleasure indure More then ye say ye fele in dyspleasure No louer nor loued.

But what if he must nedes sticke to the tone No louer nor loued. Which were then best by the masse I can name none Louer loued. The first case is yours and the next is for me In case lyke a tree I may liken ye For as a tree hath lyfe within feling wherby it felith pleasing not displeasing And can not be but contented quietly Euen the like case is yours now presently And as the hors feleth paine and not the tree Lykewyse I haue paine and no paine haue ye And as a hors aboue a tree felyth pleasure So fele I pleasure aboue you in rate sure And as the tre felith nother and the hors both Euen so pleasure and paine betwene vs twaine goeth Sins these two cases so indifferently fall That your selfe can iudge nother for perciall For indifferent ende I thinke this way best Of all our reasoning to debarre the rest And in these two cases this one question To be the issue that we shal ioyne on No louer nor loued. Be it so Louer loued. Nowe are these issues cowched so nie That both sides I trust shall take ende shortly Louer not loued. I hope and desire the same and syns we were fyrst harde, we both humbly beseche ye That we in like wise maye haue iudgement furst Louer loued. I graunt No louer nor loued. By the masse and I come best or wurst Louer loued. Though nature force man styfly to encline To his owne parte in ech particuler thing yet reason wolde man whan man shal determine Other mens partes by indifferent awarding Indifferent to be in al his reasoning wherfore in this parte cut out of affeccion So that indifferency be direccion No louer nor loued. Contented with that and by ought I espy we may in this mater take ende quickly Scan we theyr cases as she did apply them That we may perceiue what is ment by them He loueth vnloued a goodly one She is loued not louinge of an vgly one Or in his eye his louer semeth goodly And in her eye her lober semeth as vgly Her most desyred angels face he can not see His most lothely hell houndes face she can not flee He loueth, she abhorreth wherby presens is His life, her deth, wherby I say euen this Be his feling paines in euery degre As great and as many as he sayth they be yet in my iudgement by these cases hath she As great and as many feling paines as he Louer loued. When mater at full is indifferently leyd As ye in this iugement haue leyd this nowe what reason the tyme by me shulde be deleyd ye haue spoken my thought wherfore to you In peysing your paines my consciens doth alowe A iust counterpaise and thus your paynes be A iudged by vs twaine one paine in degre Louer not loued. Well sins your conscyens driueth you thus to iudge I receiue this iudgement without grefe or grudge Loued not louing. And I in like rate, yelding vnto you twaine Harty thankes for this your vndeseruid paine Louer not loued. Nowe maisters may it please you to declare As touching their partes of what minde ye are Loued not louinge. With right good will sir, and sure I suppose Their partes in fewe wordes maie come to pointe well The two examples which he did disclose All errours or doubtes do clerly expell The estate of a tre his estate doth tell And of the hors his tale wel vnderstande Declareth as well his case nowe in hande For as nothing can please or displease a tre By ani pleasure or displeasue feling Nor neuer bring a tre discontent to be So like case to him not loued nor louing Loue can no way bring pleasing or displeasing Liue women, die women, sinke women, or swim, In all he content, for al is one to him And as a horse hath mani painefull iorneis A louer best loued hath paines in like wise As here hath apered by sondry weys which sheweth his case in wurst part to rise But then as the horse feleth pleasure in sise At night in the stable aboue the tre So feleth he some pleasure as farre aboue ye In some case he feleth much more pleasure then he And in some case he feleth euen as muchelesse Betwene the more and the lesse it semeth to me That betwene their pleasures no choise is to gesse Wherfore I giue iudgement in short processe Set the tone pleasure euin to the tother No louer nor loued. Womanly spoken maistres by the roodes mother Louer not loued. Who heareth this tale wyth in different minde And seeth of these twaine eche one so full bent To his owne parte that nother in harte can finde To chaunge pleasures with other must nedes assent That she in these wordes hath gyuen ryght iudgement In affirmance wherof I iudge and awarde Both these pleasures of yours as one in regarde Louer loued. wel syns I thinke ye both without corrupcion I shall moue no mater of interrupcion No louer nor loued. Nor I but maysters though I say nought in this May I not thinke my pleasure more than his Loued not louing. Affeccion vnbridled may make vs al thynke That eche of vs hath done other wronge But where reason taketh place it can not sinke Syns cause to be percial here is none vs amonge That one hed that wolde thinke his owne wit so strong That on his iudges he myght iudgement deuise what iudge in so iudging coulde iudge hym wyse Louer loued. well myne estate ryght wel contenteth me No louer nor loued. And I with myne as well content as ye Louer not loued. So shulde ye both likewise be contented Eche other to see content in such degree As on your partes our iugement hath awarded your neyghbour in pleasure lyke your selfe to be Gladly to wishe Christes precept doth bynde ye Thus contentacion shulde alway prefer One man to ioy the pleasure of an other Louer loued. True and contencion may be in like case All though no helth yet helpe and greate relefe In both your paynes for ye hauing such grace To be contented in sufferaunce of grefe Shall by contentacion auoide much myschiefe Such as the contrary shall suerly bring you Payne to paine as paineful as your paine is nowe Thus not we foure but al the worlde beside Knowledge them selfe or other in ioy or payne Hath nede of contentacion for a gyde Hauinge ioy or payne content let vs remayne In ioy or payne of other flee we disdaine Be we content welth or woo, and eche for other Reioyse in the tone and pyte the tother Louer not loued. Syns such contencion may hardly acorde In such kynde of loue as here hath ben ment Let vs seke the loue of that louyng lorde who to suffer passion for loue was content wherby his louers that loue for loue assent Shall haue in fyne aboue contentacyon The felyng pleasure of eternall saluacyon which lorde of lordes whose ioyfull and blessed byrth Is now remembred by tyme presentyng This accustomyd tyme of honest myrth That lorde we beseche in most humble meanyng That it may please hym by mercyfull hearyng Thestate of this audyens longe to endure In myrth, helth, and welth, to graunt his pleasure AMEN.</field>
