      <field name="fulltext">PROGRAMME OF THE SCENERY. PLUTO'S FIRESIDE, With a Peep at the Champs Elysees, but not a la Mode de Paris. “Hark! he strikes his golden lyre; See the shady forms advance; Thy stone, O Sisyphus, stand still; Ixion rests upon his wheel, And the pale spectres dance. He sung and ? consented. To hear the poet's prayer— Stern Proserpine relented, And gave him back the fair.” —Pope. BARRIERE D' ENFER, Equally un-Parisian. “But soon, too soon, the lover turns his eyes— Again she falls, again she dies.” —Pope. Temple of Bacchus, on the Banks of the Hebrus, Thrace. A BACCHANALIAN PROCESSION. Orpheus discovered Sleeping alone, and waking beside himself. “Where Hebrus wanders, Rolling in meanders. He makes his moan, And calls her ghost, For ever, ever lost!” —Pope. AN ENTIRE COUNTRY DANCE, Wherein several of the Company will make Beasts of themselves, in humble imitation of their betters. “Orpheus, with his lute made trees, And the mountain tops that freeze, Bow themselves when he did sing.” —Shakespeare. Orpheus's Pipe put out by the Bacchæ, Who tear him (as is reported) into 20 pieces. SWIMMING OF THE HEAD DOWN THE HEBRUS. (A Classical Complaint.) “Yet even in death Eurydice he sung, Eurydice still trembled on his tongue; Eurydice the woods— Eurydice the floods; Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung.” —Pope. DESCENT OF PHŒBUS! ORIGIN OF THE CONSTELLATION LYRA. And Conclusion drawn by the Scene Painter and come to by the Characters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —Imperial Palace of Pluto—In the centre, his throne—portal leading to the Elysian Fields—another leading to Tartarus. Pluto, Minus, Rhadamanthus, and Æacus, seated at a table, as after dinner, with flaming goblets before them—Proserpine, the Three Fates, and the Three Furies, at another table, with tea and coffee—Fiends waiting on both parties. Glee—Pluto, Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Æacus—“Mynheer Vandunk.” Olympian Jove, In his bowers above, Drinks nectar by gallons gaily; But our thirst we slake, From a brimstone lake, Which is “warm without sugar” daily; Singing, oh! that a pool of punch had we, Instead of a flaming sulphur sea! Plu. Another bowl full of that nasty stuff; One must drink something. Pros. Sure, you've drunk enough; You set a bad example to all Hades. Your coffee's ready; come, and join the ladies. Min. (rising) Ay, ay, no more! Some coffee, ma'am, for me; I'm scarce as sober as a judge should be. Pros. I thought Lord Minos would the first be arter us! Do you take cream? Min. A little cream of Tartarus. Well, ladies, (to the Fates) hard at work, whatever wind stirs; I vow you Fates are most industrious spinsters! Miss Clotho there—man's destiny beginning— Life's thread at tea, like a te-totum spinning. And then Miss Lachesis that same thread measures, Taking great pains, but giving little pleasures, Last comes Miss Atropos, her part fulfilling, And cuts poor mortals off without a shilling. The saddest sister of the fatal three, Daughter, indeed, of shear necessity! Plying her awful task with due decorum! A never-ceasing game of “Snip, snap, snorum!” For help, alas! man pleads to her in vain— Her motto's “Cut and never come again.” Plu. (rises) Well, that's no news. Who's seen the evening paper? How are the funds? Pros. Mine, sir, are rather taper. (shewing a purse empty) Plu. Already! Well, of all the burning shames— When you've just drawn your quarter! Sparks and flames! The God of Riches might be ruin'd thus! My name, ma'am, is Pluto, and not Plutus. How have you melted all that sum away? Pros. Lost a cool hundred t'other night at play. Plu. “Lost a cool hundred!” Why, thou Queen of Sin! Is this a place to lose cool hundreds in? Min. Come, you're too warm— Plu. Warm!—when such tales are told me! She'll make these realms of mine too hot to hold me. Well as she knows the swarms of black legs round her, She must sit down to écarté, confound her! Air—Pluto—“Alice Gray.” I've all the dangers painted her, In language quite divine, But she doesn't care a farthing— She scorns advice of mine! Not Jove himself has power to curb Her passion, sir, for play! And my bank, my bank she's breaking, Through her love of écarté! To change her course I pray'd her. And she answer'd “I propose” And widely said, “I mark the king”— As if she felt my woes. The king she mark'd—it wasn't me! She but proposed—to play! Oh my bank, my bank she's breaking, Through her love of écarté. Rhad. Come, come, be calm, and change the conversation. Atropos cuts a thread from the spindle, and the Ladies scream and rise alarmed). Min. You've thrown the ladies into consternation! Here's poor Miss Atropos in such a taking! She's cut some thread she didn't mean—with shaking. Plu. 'Sdeath! you don't say so! That's an awkward blunder! Rhad. Whose life was hanging on that thread, I wonder? Pros. Here is the number, sir—whose can it be? Min. (searching in his urn) The wife of Orpheus—fair Eurydice! Here'll be a dust! Confound it, how provoking! Pros. (to Pluto) I hope you're satisfied— Plu. Nay, nay, you're joking? Min. Not I, indeed! The woman's gone, depend on't. And almost come ere this—so there's an end on't. Plu. Ho! Cerberus! Why don't the fellow stir? Will you come here or not, you ugly cur? Enter Cerberus. Run to the ferry-house—the Barley Mow, And send old Charon hither. Cer. (shaking his three heads) Bow—wow—wow! Plu. Not leave the door? Poh! nonsense! it's hard by— You'll not be gone a minute. Hie—boy—hie! Haven't you got three heads, and can't you fix One eye upon your post, pray, out of six? None of your dogged looks—but trot, sir, do! And send him here instanter! Cer. (nodding) Boo—woo—woo! (Exit) Pros. My pretty poodle, he's as white as whey,— The Furies wash and comb him every day. Plu. Charon will tell us if she's hail'd his boat,— A better fellow never was afloat. Air—Pluto—“Jolly Young Waterman.” O, who hasn't heard of the jolly old waterman, Charon, who plies on the Styx here hard by? If you'd cross the ferry, first step in his wherry, You're over ere you can Jack Robinson cry. He looks rather grim, but he rows so steadily, Smuggles his spirits across so readily, One way or other, the Fates take good care, This waterman ne'er is in want of a fare! He comes! (to Proserpine) I'll thank you for another cup. Enter Charon. Char. A boat, your honour?—the tide's running up! Plu. No, not to-night,—but tell me, Charon, pray, Have you brought over a fair dame to-day? Char. Just now, your honour! 'twas a fiddler's wife. A very pretty soul, upon my life! Plu. Where did you land her? Char. At Elysian Stairs. She told me she'd popped off quite unawares. Plu. Then 'tis too true. But as a courteous host, We'll welcome to the shades so sweet a ghost. Let her approach the presence. (Exit Charon) (to Proserpine) And you quit it. Pros. A private audience? Plu. Madame, you have hit it. So of intruding pray beware, And off immediately take yourself! What ho, there! Strike up my national air! “Go to the devil, and shake yourself.” The Dance is played—Exeunt, all but Pluto, to whom Re-enter Charon. Plu. Well, where's the lady? Why this terror, say? Char. O, mighty master! here's yourself to pay, And none to take the reckoning! Such a breeze! But don't be angry with me, if you please. Plu. What is the matter? Char. An audacious mortal Has crossed the Styx! E'en now he's at your portal. Plu. Alive? Char. And kicking. Plu. Kicking! If I've luck, it Shall go hard, but I'll make him kick the bucket! Who and what is he? and why comes he here? Char. The great musician who has lost his dear. Plu. Orpheus himself? Char. Ay, Orpheus, that's his name! He bears a lute would e'en the Furies tame! He just struck up, “Farewell, my trim built wherry,” And faith, I row'd him gratis o'er the ferry. Three-headed Cerberus, that surly growler, He silenced with a stanza of “Old Towler.” Then in he walked and played the stop waltz so, That to his wheel Ixion called out “woah!” Poor Sysiphus's ever-rolling rock At “stony batter” stood like any stock. Tantalus ceased to thirst, and Danäe's daughters Danced while he played “The Meeting of the Waters.” In short, sir—I repeat—may I be shot But there's yourself to pay, and no pitch hot! (a lute struck without) Plu. What sounds are those? Char. Sounds that your rage will smother. If you withstand his Lyre—say I'm another. Round—“Hark! 'tis the Indian Drum.” Pluto, Charon, Proserpine, Minos , &amp;c., as required. Hark! on his lute he thrums, The depths of our realms profound, Echo the wondrous sound, He comes! he comes! he comes! (All retire out o sight) Enter Orpheus. Air—Orpheus. I've been roaming, I've been roaming, Ever since I lost my dear, And I'm coming, and I'm coming, To inquire if she's here. Faith! It's a long way down, but here behold me, And “Facilis descensus” as they told me, Which for the country gentlemen unravelling, Means that “down hill 'tis very easy travelling.” Well, I have crossed the Styx, and don't care who I meet, not e'en the devil upon two! I want my wife—she must be hereabout. At home or not, I've sworn to find her out! 'Tis said that marriages are made above, And so perhaps a few may be by love; But from this smell of brimstone I should say They must be making matches here all day! Music! If thou'rt not stifled by this smoke! Music! ne'er failing friend! I thee invoke! To gain my wishes, or improve my rental, Thou'st made my vocal powers most instrumental. Duo—Orpheus and Eurydice—“Now hope now fear.” Orph. Now hope—now fear—my bosom rending, Alternate waken joy and woe. Eury. (without) Oh! Orph. Sure 'twas her voice with echo blending, No other shade this air could know. Eury. (without) No! Orph. Where dost thou stray? Eury. (without) Eh! Orph. Where would'st thou roam? Eury. (without) Home. Orph. To give thee liberty I—(sneezes)—come. (the sneeze is echoed by Eurydice) Orph. Sympathy sweet! she sneezes too! How does my dear departed do? Enter Eurydice. Eury. Charmingly, thank you, how are you? Orph. Ecstatic moment! Eury. But you sneez'd, my dear? Surely you cannot have caught cold down here? Re-enter Pluto, Proserpine, the Judges, Fates, Furies, &amp;c. Orph. No, 'tis the sulphur smells so plaguy strong, Come, love, away! We tarry here too long! Plu. No doubt you think so! but you'll tarry longer, And get a dose of sulphur rather stronger! Min. Without a passport you have cross'd our borders, “Ne exeat regno,” sir, till further orders. Air and Chorus—“Garde à vous.” Plu. Who are you?—Who are you? Thus entering my dominion. Young sir, 'tis my opinion, You will soon your rashness rue! Who are you?—Who are you?—Who are you? Your name—your state declare, sir, Deceive me if you dare, sir, For d?n me, if you do, Garde à vous! Garde à vous! Chorus. Your name and state declare, sir, Deceive us if you dare, sir, For d?n me, if you do—Garde à vous! Orph. Who are you?—who are you? This ignorance that own, sir, It argues you unknown, sir, To say I'm unknown to you. Who are you?—Who are you? Who are you? Detain me if you dare, sir! I scorn like you to swear, sir, But harkye, if you do, Garde à vous!—Garde à vous! Chorus. Your name and state, &amp;c. Plu. Ask you, rash youth, who thus your progress stops? Pluto!—the son of Saturn and of Ops. Orph. Where you the son of malt and hops—your porter, If he stopp'd me should be three heads the shorter. My name is Orpheus! on the Thracian hills I fiddle to the flocks, the trees, the rills, And when I lead, where is the beau won't follow? I'm son of Œäger—or great Apollo, I'm not quite certain which—but that's no matter, My taste for music indicates the latter. But this I know, Calliope's my mother, And I'm myself—and like me there's no other. Air—Orpheus—“O pescator dell'onda.” Oh! I on earth am famed for fiddling, I play concertos on the single string. Than Paganini, ah, Or Ole Bull far better. Mori, Cramer, Kiesewetter, Seem to me—La, la! But not alone upon the violin, I know the way to take the people in, On piano, harp, guitar, Than Hummel, Bochsa, Juli- O Regondi—I am truly Far more pop-u-lar. Plu. Well, and what here, sir, may your business be? Orph. I sought my lov'd, my lost Eurydice! My fear for her of pride my heart disarms, Oh! give her to her doting husband's arms! However strange to you it may appear, Though she's my wife—I never wished her here! Ne'er e'en in passion prayed that you would take her, And when she went, it was “pull you, pull baker!” I kneel to you—the son of great Apollo Kneels—who ne'er knelt before—I—me—like Rolla. Eury. I kneel—like Miss O'Neill—in Desdemona, “Let me go with him.” Orph. Oh, be mercy shewn her! To ransom her I'd give my best Cremona! Air—Eurydice—“Oh, ponder well.” O king of—pray be not severe, He came thus far for me; So fond a husband sure you'll spare, If but for novelty! Plu. (aside to Minos) What sweet temptation on that pouting lip! She's much too pretty, Minos, to let slip. She's now a ward of yours; so come—decree How we may keep her still in Chancery. Min. Since he at music is so good a hand, Let's pit him 'gainst the leader of your band. And if he fail— Plu. A lucky thought—I will. (aloud) Come, sir, we'll make a trial of your skill, Beat with your lute my leader's violin, And you her freedom and my pardon win. Orph. Agreed! Plu. (to an Imp) Fly off to Fiddler's Green, young shaver, And bring my King of Crotchets in a quaver! (Exit Imp) We'll soon decide what difference may be Betwixt this Tweedledum and Tweedledee— Upon our throne this fiddle case we'll hear, And you, the judges, bear a wary ear. (Pluto and Proserpine ascend their throne—the Judges, the Fates, and the Furies take their seats each side and beneath them) Re-enter Imp. Imp. My liege, he says he will not take the trouble, Unless his wages you consent to double. Plu. What? The rogue can't forget his worldly tricks, He's just as much a scraper this side Styx; Issue your writ, to make this insolent Come into court and bring his instrument. Min. Yes, I'll soon make this Signor Tweedledee come, Serve him with this subpœna—“deuces tecum.” (Imp vanishes) Music—“Old King Cole.” Imp re-appears with Signor Tweedledee. Plu. I thought that writ would make him soon arrive; Egad, he knows it needs must when I drive. Lead off, great leader, and the air shall be “The witches' dance beneath the walnut tree.” (Signor Tweedledee breaks the three strings of his violin, and plays the air on the fourth, à la Paganini) Bravo! bravissimo! Great Tweedledee! Now, Tweedledum, advance. Can'st thou break three Of thy lute strings, and from the fourth one call Such notes as those? Orph. Break three? I could break all! Nay, break the very lute itself to bits, And with the pieces play you into fits. But, mighty sir, I once at Highgate swore Ne'er to use one string when I could use four, Unless I liked one better—which I don't; And therefore, sir, with great respect, I won't. But with the bargain that has nought to do— I'll beat your leader, and may be move you; For tho' a mortal master of my art, I'll try the immortal music of Mozart. Air—Orpheus—“O dolce Concento.” O won't ye consent to Restore me, content to? To comfort my life, I want my late wife! The precedent fear not In such suits of woe, Few husbands are likely To move the court below. Then list to me, And you shall see How easily I'll put that scraper down, If he'll agree To bet with me. I like the plan, And I'm his man For half-a-crown; For when there's dearth Of fun on earth, I just for mirth Set dancing trees and stones, Then sure 'twere hard If such a bard Should fail to make A devil shake His old broiled bones. Chorus. (all dancing) O music, entrancing, It sets us all dancing, The stake was a fair one, 'Tis played for and won. Then hear him, great Pluto, Our feet, 'tis now known, When he plays his lute O, Can't call their soles their own. Signor Tweedledee breaks his bow and disappears. Plu. Faith, he has moved us all, and to some tune, There's no help for it, I must grant his boon. Pros. There's no resisting such a voice; 'twould melt Of Tartarus itself the brazen belt. Plu. Orpheus! We own our leader beaten hollow, So lead you on to earth—(to Eurydice) your wife shall follow; But on this one condition, minstrel! Mind you, Whate'er may hap, you must not look behind you. You have been guilty of most rare affection, And haply, might repent, on retrospection; So take fair warning—ere you reach the door, Look once behind—you're where you were before. Trio and Chorus—Air—“Zitti, Zitti.” Orph. Pretty, pretty soul, relying On your truth, behold me flying Back to earth—myself denying E'en a glance upon the way. Plu. Pity, pity, there's no flying From my word! How mortifying! Could I catch him once Paul-Prying, I again might seize my prey. Eury. Ditty! ditty! mollifying Even Pluto to complying— Thy strain all strains outvieing, Make the fates themselves give way. Chorus. Heigho! heigho! Can't you stop again that air to play? Plu. Quit ye! quit ye! Longer here, indeed, you must not stay! Orph., Eury. We quit ye—quit ye! Longer here, indeed, we cannot stay. (closed in by</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second Barrière d'Enfer, and Entrance to the Champs Elysées, but not à la mode de Paris. A knocking at the gate—Cerberus in his Porter's Lodge. Cer. Open locks, whoever knocks. (pulls a cordon and the gate opens, disclosing the banks of the Styx and Charon's ferry-boat) Enter Charon. Char. How now? Why, Cerberus! you've found a tongue I vow, And can say something more than “bow—wow—wow!” Cer. Ay, thanks to Orpheus, I've three tongues found. Char. One of 'em talks dog-Latin, I'll be bound. But wherefore Orpheus thank? Responde cur? Cer. Why, ere he came and made this mighty stir, I was a three thick wooden-headed dog, With but a bark like any other log. Now as I am described—and by no dunce— I really feel “three gentlemen at once!” And ever since I heard him play and sing, I've sat and warbled, sir, like anything. Char. You mean you've howled some doggrel to the moon. Cer. No, sir; I say I sing—and sing in tune! Char. A bark-a-role of course. Cer. No, sir, a glee. Char. You take the treble, then? Cer. I take all three. My voice is tenor—counter-tenor—bass. Char. Let's try a quartette then, if that's the case. Cer. With you, forsooth? Char. Oblige me by beginning one— I've seen a dancing dog, but never heard a singing one! Quartette—Cerberus and Charon—“Begone dull care.” Cer. Begone, dull Charon! pry'thee begone from me! Thou'rt too dull, Charon, ever to sing a glee. Long time thou hast been ferrying here, And souls from far dost bring; But thou know'st, dull Charon, Little of sol-fa-ing. I range with care through all the keys— My compass—octaves three! My voice can rove from A above, Down, down to double D. Char. Begone dull cur! shall such a land-lubber as thee, Pretend, dull cur! to talk of a compass to me? I'm the son of Nox, And a compass could box, When thou wert a blind puppy. So avast, dull cur! I'm a vast deal 'cuter than thee. For I will bet my crazy bark Against your own crack'd three, That no one can go to the D—below, If I didn't go to C. Enter Orpheus, preceded by an Imp, with a link. Imp. This way, your honour—here are the old stairs. Orph. A boat there, Charon! Char. Sculls or oars? Orph. Who cares? Your sculls are thickest—there's less fear of breaking. Cer. Is he so soon our gloomy realms forsaking? Char. (to Imp) Go get her out there. (to Orpheus) Over did you say? Orph. Back to the stairs you brought me from to-day. Char. And for the same fare? Nothing but a song? I shall get rich if this game lasts for long. Orph. No—here's a fairer—come, don't look so blue, You've crossed the Styx till you're as cross as two. I say, old fellow, just look o'er my shoulder, And say if my fair comes—as Pluto told her. Char. Yes—there she is—and Pluto close beside her, Whispering soft nonsense. Orph. Is he? Woe betide her, If to his suit she listens! Does she smile? Char. Yes, and her hand he squeezes all the while. Orph. He does! confusion! Come, jump in your boat, I shall look back now, ere I get afloat! Enter Pluto and Eurydice. Plu. My hopes at every step are growing fainter— She'll let me go when he lets go the painter. Orph. Eurydice—too long you linger there— Eury. I come! Plu. Farewell, thou fairest of the fair— One kiss at parting. Eury. Oh, for shame, sir! Fie! Remember, sir, my husband is close by. Imp. (to Orpheus) Lord bless your honour, dont forget poor Jack! (Pluto kisses Eurydice) Orph. Eh—what was that? I heard an amorous smack—Eurydice! (turns quickly) Plu. Hurrah! he has looked back! Forward, my Furies! do your work, ye Fates! And thrust the Thracian thrummer through the gates! Enter Furies and Fates. Trio—Air—“Cruda Sorte.” Eury. Cruel Fortune! Plu. Fairly caught, sir! Orph. Cruel Fortune! Plu. Just as I thought, sir! All. Break your/my lute, for all is o'er! Plu. You have looked back—in my snare you are caught, sir— They who cheat me, faith, have none to cheat more; To a fine market your pigs you have brought, sir! The world is before you and so is the door! Orph. I have looked back—in your snare I am caught, sir— Pluto, thou'st cut a fond pair to the core! Oh, have I come all this way to be taught, sir, That folks who would thrive must keep looking before? Eury. You have looked back—in the snare you are caught, sir— They who cheat him, faith, have none to cheat more! A man of the world—have you yet to be taught, sir, When your wife flirts behind you to look straight before? Exeunt Eurydice and Infernals—Orpheus is forced off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. —Banks of the Hebrus—On one side, a temple dedicated to Bacchus—on the other a grotto. Enter Fauns, Satyrs, and Bacchantes, with Pan drawn by Satyrs, and Silenus riding on an ass—Priests of Bacchus and Musicians, forming a grand Bacchanalian procession to the air of “Come jolly Bacchus.” Sil. Come, let's begin our orgies! Here's the place, The fairest temple Bacchus owns in Thrace; The Bunch of Grapes! kept by a jolly priest; Good entertainment here for man and beast; Put up your panthers, and set out the table, And let's get drunk as fast as we are able. Pan. Why, you are drunk already, old Silenus. Sil. It's no such thing—I'm only Bacchi plenus; Full of the god! possessed—Io—Iacche! Blow your pipes, Pan. I'll blow a pipe of backy, And finish with a pipe of rich Canary. My pretty Pan! my great Pan of the dairy! Chorus —“Masaniello.” O come, and worship at the shrine Of Bacchus, god of rosy wine. Let Phœbus drink the pearly dews, The “early purl” of these purlieus. Our society Scorns sobriety. “Mountain dew,” Perhaps might do, But we champagne Prefer to drain, And don't complain Of Clos Vougot. Pan. (approaching the grotto) Thou sweet retreat from Sol's meridian fire— What's here? A mortal sleeping on a lyre! (starting back as he discovers Orpheus asleep in the grotto) 1st Bac. Who can he be? Pan. O, 'tis the mad musician, Who lately made to Pluto a petition To give him back his wife. Sil. His wife! Dear me, How very, very mad the man must be! 1st Bac. D'ye think he'll bite? Sil. Psha, stuff! D'ye think he'll drink? Pan. Stand back—he seems about to wake, I think. Orpheus starts up, and rushes forward from grotto. Orph. Give me another wife. Tune up my lyre. Have mercy, Pluto! Ah, my brain's on fire! I am a lunatic for lack of thee! Mad as a March hare! O, ma chère amie! (sings) Air—“How should I your true love know?” Where is my Eurydice? Sweet Echo, speak of her! Cries Echo, bent on mocking me, “You're rid I see—of her.” Sil. He's beastly drunk! Pan. Pshaw, man, he's only crazy— Sil. Then shave his head, and make him wear a jazy. Song—Orpheus—“To morrow is St. Valentine's Day.” Set a beggar on horseback and then you know, Where he'll ride to very well; I went to beg for my wife, and so I rode in a boat to— Air—“O no, we never,” &amp;c. [Orpheus] O no, we never mention it, At least to ears polite; 'Twould give St. James's Square a fit And shock Pall Mall outright; And yet in said St. James's Square, And also in Pall Mall, There are some places, I declare, Would very like it spell. Pan. “There's matter in this madness”—Well you went Down stairs, you say, and pray with what intent? Air—Orpheus—“Kitty Clover.” I went to inquire of Mr. Pluto—O, O, O, O, O! &amp;c.— If he'd let my dearest Eurydice go—O, O, O, O! &amp;c.! He set his own fiddler to play against me, But his fiddle to mine was all fiddle-de-dee; Oh, oh, the poor scraper, I bother'd him so—O, O, O, O, &amp;c.— He broke in a violint taking his bow—O, O, O, O, &amp;c. Air—“With lowly suit.” [Orpheus] I won my darling with a ditty, But I looked back, and that was pity! Air—“French Air.” [Orpheus] For husbands of fashion should always be Blind to such little unmeaning flirtations, In such situations to hear or to see, Is not only silly, but horribly low! So, know when down stairs you go, High life above is like high life below! Pan. This nothing's more than matter; but I say, When you were down stairs, pray what did you play? Orph. I played the devil, as I will with you, You nasty, smoking, sotting, soaking crew! Pan. Abuse the rites of Bacchus! mad or not, Sure as my name is Pan, you go to pot! Orph. Indeed! nay, then, before I've done with you, Pan, You shall cut capers till you're in a stew-Pan! (strikes his lyre, and all seem entranced) Air—Orpheus—“Voulez-vous danser?” Voulez-vous danser, while I play, Trees make bows and stump away, Lawns and meadows dance the hay, And rocks to reel are fain, sir? Rivers join the country-dance, Streamlets in quad-rills advance, Fountains cool Glide through la poole, And pastorale the plain, sir; Voulez-vous danser, while I play, Panthers paws-de-deux essay And lordly lions waltz away With all their might and mane, sirs. During this air the trees have become animated—a lion and a panther enter waltzing—the mountains rock in the distance and the Temple of Bacchus tumbles to pieces, the columns and statues dancing round Orpheus, while Pan, Silenus, and all the Bacchantes, &amp;c., foot it in their own despite. Chorus—Pan, Silenus, &amp;c.—Waltz in “Der Freyschutz.” Rot the fellow's play! Take his lute away. Must we waltz all day? Will you stop, I say? He's St. Vitus, sure! Nought his dance can cure; Must we thus endure Till we drop? Tear him limb from limb Let his crazy pate Down the river swim, For his head the fate, Who has set the sound- est could here be found, Spinning round and round, Like a top! Rot the fellow's play, &amp;c. They succeed at last in snatching the lyre from Orpheus, whom they then seize, and drag off furiously—they then re-enter, with fragments of his dress, and laurel wreath, and the head of Orpheus is presently seen floating down the river. Head. Eurydice! Eurydice! Eurydice! (Head disappears) Pan. He's torn to bits, yet swears he isn't dead. He seems to have a singing in his head. Music—“Glorious Apollo.” Pan. By Jove, here comes Apollo! As sure as fate he's heard the fellow holloa. I'm off. (Exit) Sil. (tumbling from his donkey) And so am I. Apollo descends in the car of the sun. Music—“Now Phœbus sinketh.” Apol. Well may you run! Is this the way you serve the Sun's own son All. Forgive us, mighty Phœbus! Apol. Orpheus, rise! Put on your head, and with me seek the skies. Orpheus re-appears. And as some instrument you'll there require, I'll make a constellation of your lyre. (flings the lyre into the sky, where it appears amidst the other constellations, which have, during the foregoing lines, gradually descended) Orph. Thanks, dear papa! that's very kind and clever But must I leave Eurydice for ever? Surely your Phaeton has room for three. You must—you shall release Eurydice! Indeed, unless you do, I can't go there, And for this weighty reason. Did I care, (drawing him aside) Ever so little as a wife about her— There's a finale can't be sung without her. Apol. Oh! then indeed, when music's in the case, All other things, of course, with me, give place, So, Uncle Pluto! Pluto pops his head through the stage. Plu. Well, how now? what is it? Apol. Arn't it about the time your queen should visit Her mother, Ceres, and for six months stay Upon Olympus? Plu. Yes, the very day. Apol. Then let Eurydice attend upon her As mistress of the robes, or Dame of Honour. Plu. Why, I suppose I must, Sol, if you press it; Not that I'm much averse to't—I confess it; For, to speak truth, she does make such a riot Below, the very Fates can't work in quiet. But what will Jove say, if I let her out? Apol. Leave him to me. Plu. But is there any doubt Of sanction from some more important powers? Will they this treaty ratify of ours? They may decree Orpheus himself shall fall, And then his wife need not come up at all. Orph. Oh, I'll ask that! for they're more used to me. Befriend poor Orpheus and Eurydice! It all depends upon your smile or frown— Whether she shall come up, or I go down. Alarm has rendered even Pluto civil! He fears lest you should raise the very devil! His judges must be guided by your jury. His furies quake, lest they should rouse your fury. His fates are trembling now to learn their own. Please to be pleased, and make your pleasures known, And for the sake of old “Olympic Revels,” Condemn not to the shades Olympic Devils. These two lines apply more directly to the theatre in which the piece was originally performed. (the Audience applaud of course) (to Pluto) There's your permit—seek Proserpine, and tell her, That she may move the spirit from the cellar. Proserpine rises with Eurydice. Finale—“Go to the Devil and shake yourselves.” Eury. When you're dull, and wish merry to make yourselves, Pros. At this fountain of mirth you may slake yourselves. Apol. When sleepy come hither and wake yourselves. Plu. When cold it's a good place to bake yourselves. Orph. And since home at eleven you take yourselves, It can never be said that you rake yourselves; In all cases, then, hither betake yourselves, And out of the blue devils shake yourselves. Chorus. And since home at eleven, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
