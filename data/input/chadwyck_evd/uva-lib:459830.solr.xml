      <field name="fulltext">NEGLECTED VIRTUE OR, THE Unhappy, Conquerour,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable Sir JOHN SMITH Baronet, And One of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy-Chamber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Writ and Spoke by Mr. Horden. As idle Beggars, when they'd Pity move, With borrow'd Bastard at their Backs do rove, T'incite good Christians Charity and Love, So I, that I might have a fair Pretence To feed (what some Fools call Extravagance) Have begg'd this spurious Play from Hands unknown. I have engag'd, the honest Rakes o'th'Town, That they will all espouse it as their own. But e're 'tis tried, let me its Cudgels choose: I first except all Writers for the other House, All good Authors, andâno, I'll trust the Beaux: For it's so free from VVit they've no Pretension To damn one Line for want of Apprehension. Besides, each Beau's a Friend; for if it miss, He'll not disturb his solemn Face to hiss. And good or bad, the Ladies sure will spare The generous Poet, for the labouring Player. And now your Smiles a double Kindness hold, The Poet shares the Praises, I the Gold. Guineas, they say, in low condition be, Pray Heav'n they're low enough to fall to me. Yet you who've kept 'em by you, don't repent ye, My Guinea Box takes all at Nine and twenty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. Morteux. Spoken by Mr. Haynes, Acting the Mad-Man. Our Poet made me mad, and I dare say, You're all as mad, if you don't like his Play. Some are Horn-mad, and some are Bible mad; Some mad to write damn'd Plays, and that's damn'd bad. In short, 'tis a mad World; for now I spy A Hundred here, at least, as mad as I. Thick Plot, thin House, I can't forbear to cry. This Fasting time is like to mortifie us; Three times a Week, at least, you'll not come nigh us: Pray do by t'other House, as you do by us. 'Twas Pride hot as Hell Taught 'em first to rebell. [Sings. I'll sing no more; I caught this Hoarseness, I'm afraid, Dancing at Drapers-Hall last Maquerade. Silence in the Court there. Here, Plaintiff, give me Fee, I have a QuirkâDefendant, don't agree. Each take a Shell, the Oyster is for me. VVhat makes that Judge there sleep upon the Bench? See that Spark yonder Ogle th'Orange-Wench. What think you of the Invasion by the French? What's here? on ev'ry Woman's Head I spy [Starts. The Whore of Babylon's Mitred-dress three Stories high. See, see, she's here! see 'tis the very same, Her Face a Picture, her Commode the Frame. VVhat long-curl'd Main that pouder'd Thing annoys! All you patch'd Maidens, and old bearded Boys, Off, off, off, with these vain fantastick Toys. [Sings, throws off his Perriwig, &amp;c. Abstain from Vanities, and vicious VVays, Among the Congregation spend your Days. Young VVomen, shun all Sports, but our Religious Plays. [Cants. I say, abstain from Fleshâif e're you can; And ogle noneâexcept the precious Man. Don't pelt wild Fellows with fond Billets-Doux: Leave chatting at York-Building Interviews, Nor stoop to peep into the Choc'late House. Talk not of Beaux upon your visiting Day, Nor borrow of 'em when you lose at Play, Then never pay 'em, but the wicked VVay. Have no Intrigues: Shun Taverns, and Debauches; Drink your Tea hot, and leave off Hackney-Coaches. Fast, not in Lent: I say Affliction's good. Here Mr. Hains made several pleasant Digressions, too long to be inserted; and to make place for 'em, omitted some Lines of this Epilogue. Affliction's a Horse-Leach, a Flail, a Flageolet, a Flood: Hark you Kid Horden, the first He that hisses, (For the She's are our Friends, at least the Misses) Challenge him, fight him, kill him, thus, sah, hah! But that's the way to be truss'd up you'll say. Pshaw, are Physicians hang'd that kill Folks ev'ry Day? Let all be kind then. But stay, I'd forgot, I think this Horden's guilty of a Plot. This Play's a Plot on youâBut yet I'm thinking, 'Tis but to get Recruits for honest Drinking. If that Plot takes, I ha'n't been mad in vain; Your Smiles can bring me to my Sence again.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE, the Capitol City of Parthia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Bretton, followed by Curio. Curio. Indeed, my Lord, you are too rugged to her. Bret. Pray, Sir, hold your peace. Cur. So sweet a Child as she is, such a Mirrour of Beauty. Bret. A Mirrour of Folly, is she not? Cur. How can you be angry with her? How can any Wind blow rough upon a Blossom so fair and tender? Bret. Look ye, Cousin, all this is but prating; I'll make her see with my Eyes, hear with my Ears, talk with my Tongue, and taste with my Pallate: I begot her, bred her, and I will make her. Cur. âA Whore, if you marry her against her Inclination. Bret. Why, is it not a Man I wish her too? a young Man? a handsom Man? a rich Man? Cur. âAnd a wise Man? Bret. No, no; as for Wisdom, we'll let that alone: Besides, none but Fools and Madmen marry now a-days, unless here and there a younger Brother, or a broken Gamester, that ties up with some old rich Widow, to prop up his falling Fortunes. Cur. But, Sir, she is tender yet. Bret. Prythee hold thy PeaceâShe can endure the Hammer, and why not the Workman that strikes deepest? She's fourteen, and if she is not ready now for rutting.â Cur. But will you allow no liberty for choosing? Bret. Why, I believe the Devil's in the Fellow. Dost thou think, I that have lived a Courtier to the age of sixty and upward, don't know better how to choose than a little piss-tal'd Girl, that has not yet wash'd her Mother's Milk off of her Chaps. But I know the reason of her Coyness; there's another in the Wind that hovers over her, a young smock-fac'd Rogue, not worth a Shilling; and yet she's too young. Cousin, let me tell you, Inclination is a great ripener of a young female Flower. Enter Amadine, and Ariena. See, see, here she comes, with her wanton Instructor: I find I must rid my House of that Baggage, or there can never be any Peace in Israel. So, good morrow to you; my, that's as you deserve too: You know my Mind, therefore let me see you study to deserve it. Am. I shall endeavour to obey you. But, noble Sirâ Bret. Hold your Peace, you little Ferret you, let me have none of your set Phrases. Ari. Ud's life don't be Tongue-tide, Cousin. Hark'ee, you piece of dry'd Mummy. Am. Nay, give him good Language, Cousin. Ari. give him Ratsbane. Hark'ee, old Sixty odd, do you with that Whey Beard think your self at years of discretion to dispose of a young brisk Maidenhead, a shrivell'd piece of Parchment, sit for no use but to have his Skin flea'd off, to engross in cheating Mortgages upon. Bret. Tell me, thou eternal Thunderclap, how darest thou talk thus? Ar. Tell me, old Nestor, first, how darest thou do thus? Bret. Hussey, get out of my House. Ari. I won't; I'll stay to plague you: And if you don't take some milder Course with your Daughter, I'll watch my opportunity, steal her out, and set fire to your House; d'ye hear, I shall so singe your Muzzle, Grandsire Gray beard. Bret. By this Light, I'll have her hang'd. Ari. Do, and hang your Daughter too; 'tis ten times better than marrying her to a piece of Logwood. Enter Castilio. 'Odso here he comes, new-comb'd and powder'd, like a Prentice upon a Holy-day. Bret. Well, Impudence, he has saved your Bones for this time. Noble Castilio, good morrow to you. Cast. Good morrow my Lord: Good morrow Miss Wife, that must be. Ari. Good morrow, noble Sir. Cast. Thank you. Ari. How proud am I to see our homely Roof bless'd with the Rays of such resplendent Beauty. Fortune is sure distributing her Favours, and sends the greatest to adorn your Servant. Cast. Hark'ee, Father that must be, I really believe this young Gentlewoman's mad: The last time I was here, Fool, Booby, Loggerhead, Puppy, and such like Names, she thought too good for me; and now she's all upon the Complement. What the Devil's the meaning of all this? Bret. Sir, you must forgive; she is a little craz'd by Fits. Hussey be gone, or I'll cane you in. Ari. Ah! cruel Sir, will you then drive me from the sight of those dear Eyes, that lovely Face: Open that precious Mouth, from whence there falls Wit faster than the Rheum from Nunkles Eyes. Cast. Why, Father-in Law, been't you ashamed to stand still, and hear your Flesh and Blood, that is to be, abused thus? Bret. Hark'ee, you Whore in imagination, you well-wisher to the Trade of Cuckoldom, thou unlawful Destroyer of Maidenheads, get thee gone presently, or I'll use the so scurvily, that the Punishment of a duck'd Scold, a pillory'd Cheat, or a carted Bawd, shall be honourable Punishment to what I'll make thee go through. Ari. Well, well, Unkle, I will be gone; but one Word of Advice before I go. Come hither Cousin, be ruled by me, marry the Man your Father bids you; cuckold him with every Footboy in the Lobby; spend his Estate on Bullies; deal with all sorts of Men, all Languages; make thy self a Mother of Nations. Use Husband, Father, both like stubborn Knaves; Obtain thy Freedom, and make them the Slaves. [Exit. Cast. Why, what the Devil has possess'd the Woman? Bret. I am struck with astonishment! but 'tis no matter, I'll soon get rid of her.âCome, Nephew, we'll walk in, and leave the Lovers together. Worthy Castilio, I wish you good Success with my Daughter; she's something too young, and that makes her foolish, but you must bear with that. I'll to Court, and hear what News is stirring, and whether these Medians design to block us up till we become Food for one another. [Exit Bret. and Cur. Cast. Well, Miss, you see how Matters are like to go; your Father designs me for your Mouse-trap of Matrimony. Why dost not talk to me, Wench, ha? What, not a Word?âWell, it's no great matter, for if I marry, 'tis not for the sake of the Tongue. A good Estate, with the Tail tagg'd to it, will do my Business well enough. Well, but, Miss, when shall we marry? Am. When you please, Sir. Cast. Why that's well said; I love a Woman that speaks little, and to the purpose. Look'ee, Miss, you are a Lord's Daughter, and I am a Lord's Son, you don't love me, nor I don't much care for you; but what then, there are young Men and Women enow about the Court, and if we can't among 'em all find some to please us, 'tis pity but we were condemned to feed on one Dish all our Life time. Am. Won't you be pleas'd to follow my Father, Sir? Cast. Why, ay, an' you will, Sweet heart I think there's no great occasion for talking more, since we're both agreed of the matter. Enter Lycastes, and Ariene. Who the Devil have we here now! Mrs. Many-minds, and a young brisk Fellow with her: I'm resolv'd I'll stay; for tho' she be young enough to be a Whore, she has Malice enough to be a Bawd; therefore I'll not trust her. Ari. How now, Grease and Poville, I thought you had been gone by this time. Cast. No, Plaister of Paris, I'm here still. Lyc. Dear Amadine! Am. My dear Lycastes, welcome. Cast. Hey day! What's here to do? Heark'ee, Friend, will you be pleas'd to keep your distance; this Philley is already provided of a Rider, I can assure you. Qui dil vox? Cast. What the Devil does he say now? D'ye see Sir, in my own Country Language, I tell you once again, I'm to have the backing of this Colt; therefore pray go about your business. Lyc, Are not you, Sir, Son to the Lord Castilio? Cast. Yes, Sir, I am his only Son, his first-born Child, the Prop of his Family, the staff of his Age, and the Heir to his Estate. Lyc. Why then, Sir, I have News to tell you: I came just now from Court, where I left your Father in an Apoplectick Fit, given over by his Physicians. Cast. How! how! my Father given over! Nay then, Miss, your humble Servant: Your Affections and mine are not so fast ty'd, but an Estate will quickly unloose 'em. [Exit. Lyc. I thought there was no way but this to get rid of him. Well, my dear Amadine, how stands your Father affected? Am. He continues his cruel Resolutions still, to marry to that Coxcomb. Ari, And we continue our Resolutions, to make Coxcombs of them both before it comes to that. Am. Nay, for my part, I'll sooner live in a Hovel upon Water and wild Sallads, than be forc'd to marry against my Inclinations. Lyc. My dear, my Fortunes are not so despicable to throw you on so mean a Remedy. Do you but find a means to decieve your watchful Guardians, and I'll find means to secure us from wild Sallads and a Hovel, I'll warrant thee. Enter a Servant. Serv. Madam, your Father is return'd. Ari. Ud'slife, slip you out at the Garden Door. Lyc. Farewel, my Jewel, keep constant to thy Resolutions, and we may both be happy. [Exit. Am. Never doubt me. Ari. No, no; let us alone: If we two young Girls can't cozen one old Fellow, 'tis pity but we were nailed against a Wall with our Heels upward. SCENE, The Palace. Enter King, Memnon, Old Castillio, Guards and Attendants. King. Still, Memnon, we withstand their battering Rams, Still our strong Walls defie the Median Fury, Against all Dangers still my Breast stands firm. Mem. There's Winter, Sir, in all your Parthians Veins, Nor will the Soldiers be induc'd to Flight, But basely from your Royal Standard shrink. King. Slaves! do they see the threat'ning Flood o'erwhelm Their Country, and like senceless Brutes, gaze at The near approaching Deluge till they're lost? Mem. Your Citizens, whose Coward Souls ne'er knew What Valour was, without the Plumes of Fortune, Seeing you drove within this last result, Into the narrow Bounds of one poor City; Disturb their Rest with Dreams of rifled Hoards: Their own, their Wives, their Sons and Daughters Fates, And like infected Caitiffs spread their Fears By their contagious Murmurs through the Streets. Cast. Already they have priz'd your Head, and plot Who shall be first to seize the sacred Prey. They've told the Stores, the Lordships they shall gain; And when the Great, the Royal Oak is struck, There's none but hopes a Branch, beneath whose Shade Their Revels are design'd; and with one Voice, They cry, an Artaban, an Artaban, Must these Rewards, and their Deliverance bring. King. Is Artaban the Minion of their Hearts? Was not that Traytor, Memnon, justly banish'd? He by my Influence first to being rose, And nurtur'd by my warmest Rays grew Great; Yet all my best Rewards he did contemn, And scorn'd a meaner Bounty than t'espouse My only Daughter, and possess my Throne: Fortune and Fate oppress me as they please, I never can forgive such Insolence. Cast. Sir, Sir, you may yet command what Terms you please, The great Tigranes only fights for Love; And wou'd you grant Elinda to his Arms, He'd quickly lay his conquering Weapons down, And bend to pay his Homage at your Feet, A double Vassal, Son and Subject both. Mem. If Kings deserve, why may not he deserve her? Fame loudly speaks the Largeness of his Soul, How brave in Fields, in Courts how amorous! Pleasant and Martial, Great, and yet not Proud; As free from Passion as th'unkindled Fire: Yet urg'd, can loose his Reins, and let the Beast Course it a-while to shew he is a Man. King. Must it be said 'twas Arms made Phraates grant Offers; in Peace, he almost scorn'd to hear, Oh, this reclaims me, this disturbs that Rest, Which liberal Nature by her Charter gives To every Peasant on his Bed of Straw. Cast. Sir, Success proclaims Men Great. Tigranes till he conquer'd was not so; Now who is greater than Tygranes is? What distant Nations do not dread his Strength? Even Rome it self, the Empress of the World, Glad of a Peace, embrac'd him as her Friend. His Faults to you are meritorious grown, And in my Judgment purchase this Alliance. King. There's no resisting of an adverse Fate, When wayward Gods contend struggling 'gainst them, Entangles more, and weaves us in the Toil. [Shouts, Drums and Trumpets within. Enter Lysander. What mean these Shouts? Lys. Hail, Gracious Prince, we are at length reliev'd. King. Whence? or by whom? it is impossible! Lys. The Shades of Night their lowest Ebb had made, And flowing Light began to swell the Day, When first our Scouts th'incamped Host descry'd. All in Disorder, rowz'd from Sleep,âto Arms; To Arms the general Cry: The distant Parts Of the wide Wings in Terrours wak'd, in haste They rose, and trembled 'ere they knew for what, Undrest, half-arm'd, around their Troops they gaz'd, Saw dismal Fear, Distraction in each Eye; Some Wonder-struck, like Statues stood, as if Gorgonian Charms had petrify'd their Feet: Others for Flight prepar'd, and all amaz'd, Whilst still the unintelligible Noise increas'd. King. From whence the Cause? Lycas. That, Sir, deserves your Ear. Five hundred Horse led by a valiant Chief, To their main Body did their Out-Guards press, Surpriz'd with Thought a greater Strength was near, The highest parts, did crowd, the next, in Hopes By Numbers to withstand the Storm, yet this Did but facilitate his Victory; For still he forward drove, and still they fled, Till in the Field the scatter'd Deaths were strew'd Thick as Autumnal Leaves before the Wind, Until at last, that mighty Host, which but Some Hours before our Terrour was, in Flight, Left us the Field, glad any ways to save Their Lives, from the rapacious Victor's Sword, Who now approaches to your joyful Gates. Kin. Let's haste to meet him; And you, my Lords, witness to what I vow, If our Deliverer be a Man, on whom My Daughter can her kind Affection place, To morrow's Sun this Nuptial Rites shall see, And mix our Joys in that Solemnity. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Bretton, Curio, Ariene, and Servants. Bret. Gone! Why 'tis impossible, she cou'd not creep out at the Key-Hole, sure; Is she a thing invisible; Gone, and not know it? Cur. You amaze your Servants. Bret. Some Rogue or other has watched her Hour of Itching, and claw'd her, claw'd her, do you mind me? Some Rascal, I'll warrant, that I foster up. Cur. They are all here, Sir. Brit. Let 'em be where they will, they're all Rascals, Sir; and by this Hand, I'll hang 'em all. Cur. Deal calmly; you will not give 'em time to answer. Bret. I'll choak 'em, famish 'em; what say you, Wag-tail? you knew her Mind, you were of Council with her; Let me know where she is. Cur. Ask with Discretion. Bret. Discretion! Hang Discretion: Pox you, confound you, damn you all. Hussy, let me know where she is. Ari. Would you know of me, Sir? Bret. Of you, Sir! Ay of you, Sir: Why, what are you, Sir? Ari. Your Niece, an't like your Worship. Bret. A Bawd, an't like your Worship; a Lady fairy, to oyle the Doors a Nights, that they may open without squeeking. Ari. 'Tis very well, Sir. Bret. You lye, 'tis damnable ill, Sir: Hearky', will you confess yet? Ari. If I were guilty, I'd be hang'd first: Is this an Age to confess in? Bret. Tell me the Truth, Ariene, and as I live I'll give thee a new Petticoat. Ari. If you'd give me ten, I would not tell you. A Petticoat! I'd have you know, Sir, Truths are now a-days at a higher Price, than I perceive you are aware of. Cur. Come, Cousin, deal modestly. Ari. Why, I don't pluck my Cloaths. Bret. What say you, Sirrah, you, and you, are you all dumb? Port. I saw her last Night, an't shall like your Worship. Bret. Did you so, an't shall like your Worship? Where lay she? who lay with her? Port. In truth, not I, Sir; I lay with my Fellow Frederick, in the Flea-Chamber. Ari. I left her by her self in her own Closet; and there I thought she had slept. Bret. Were all the Doors locked? Port. All mine. Serv. And mine; she cou'd not get out that way, unless she leap'd the Wall; and I am sure that's higher than any Woman's Courage dares venture at. Bret. Come, come, I say once more, Hussy, you must know. Ari. Why then, Sir, I'll tell you what I know. Bret. I, do, that's my Ari. Ari. In the the first place, I believe she's gone, because you can't find her. In the second, I believe she's weary of your Tyranny, and therefore gone; and in the third place, I believe she's in Love, where you have no good Liking; and in the fourth place, If I were she, I'd see you hang'd before I'd come agen. Bret. Was there ever so much Impudence in Woman! Get you out my Doors. Ari. Ay, with all my Heart; if your House was Gold, and she not in it, I should count it nothing but a Cage to whistle in. Bret. If she be above ground I will have her. Ari. I'd live in a Coal-pit then, if I were she. Bret. Go search the House once more, all Corners where 'tis possible she may go out: If I do find your Tricksâ Ari. I care not what you find, so you don't find her. [Ex. Serv. Enter Castilio Junior. Cast. Why, how now, Father-in-law, what, I hope you han't got a sham Fit of the Apoplexy too: Look, look, how he struts about, like a new-made Gentleman-Usher. My Lord, your Lordships most humble Servant; pray how does Miss Wife do? Bret. Oh, Son-in-law, she's quite undone. Cast. Why, she is not married yet, is she? Bret. Nay Heaven knows, she may be for ought I know; she is stoln out of the House, and is gone, Heaven knows whither. Cast. HumphâNow do I begin to smell out my Fathers Apoplectick Fit; I perceive I was not shamm'd off so for nothing, Look ye, Father that shou'd have been, if your Daughter be gone, there's a Witch at your Elbow knows what Wind will fetch her back again, Ari. Meaning me, Sweet Sir? Cast. Yes, you, sweet Lady, pray when went the Gentleman away that was so kind to bring me the News of my Fathers being given over by his Physicians. A Plague of his Message, I'm sure he procur'd me a good drubbing. Ari. He went just after you, Forsooth. Bret. How! A Man was there! a Man with her! Ari. O, yes, Unkle, the prettiest, sweetest, good humoredst Gentleman I ever saw in all my life. Bret. And how got he in? tell me. Ari. I let him in, Forsooth. Bret. And who was it? tell me, my dear Ariene, tell me, and I protest I'll give thee new Cloaths from top to bottom. Ari. I'll rather turn Adamite, and bring Fig Leaves into fashion again. Bret. 'Slife, I could find in my Heart to murder the jade. Cast. If I an't mistaken, my Lord, they call him, Ly, Ly, Ly, something. Bret. Lycastes. Cast. The same, by Jupiter. Bret. Oh! Rogue, Dog, Oh! Villain, he has been hankering after her above this half year. Enter Servants. Porter drunk. How now, what news? is she i'th'House? Por. I'm sure she's not i't'Cellar; for look ye, Sir, if she had been i't' cellarâ Bert. I'm sure thou hast been there. Port. Yes truly, Sir; and I carry'd the matter very swimmingly; I search'd every piece of Wine, yes sure, Sir, every Terse that could but testifie, and I drew hard to bolt her out. Bert. Away with him, fling him into the Hay-loft. Go Rascals, careless Dogs, get me my Sword, my Pistols, and arm your selves quickly; I'll to that Rascal's House, I'm sure she's rousled there. Come, Castillio, will you accompany me? Cast. Ay, with all my Heart, Sir. Bret. And d'ye hear, Hussey, get you to your Chamber, and let me find you at my return,âorâ [Exit Bret. Cast. and Servants. Ari. Wipe your Beard, Unkle, the Effects of your Anger hangs upon't. Why what a little ill-natur'd Titt was this to steal away without my Knowledge. Well, I'm resolv'd I'll follow her, and be an eternal Plague to this old Devil of a Father of hers: Sure Lycastes, will have Wit enough to conceal her; thither I'm certain she's gone. Well, I'll to my Chamber, and study how to make my escape unknown. I'll teach his anger to dispute with Women. [Exit. SCENE the Palace. The King sitting on a Throne; the Queen and Princess by him. On each side the Throne, Memnon, Castillio, Lysander, Singers in Warlike Habits, A Symphony of Warlike Musick, and then a Song. After the Song, the King, &amp;c. rises. King. So Jove Imperial, from his Throne of Thunder, Circled by all the lesser Train of Court, Attending Gods speaks the big Voice of Fate. Monarchs are Joves on Earth, their Words are Laws, And these are mine. In all ourâbe This Day for ever mark'd a Festival. Let smoaking Altars Loads of Incense waste, Forrests of perfumed Trees be rooted up; Whence hallow'd Herds in spicy Clouds, shall mount, And with their victim'd Odours Feast the Gods. Sound all our Trumpets, beat up all our Drums, Musick of War; Ring out the Bells of Peace; Mankind be glad, whilst the rich Goblet crown'd With sparkling Gore, launch'd from the wounded Grape, In Healths at e'ry Table walk the round. Nor be it here restrain'd, our Conduits fill, Till from their Heads whole Rivers are pour'd down, And their long Streams reach Neptune's large Bowl. [King drinks, and Trumpets sound. Enter Artaban attended. Behold my Lords, here our Deliverer comes. Art. The Gods, the Gods, great Sir, have us'd my Sword, Weak in these Hands, but conquering in theirs, To punish the proud Arms of that bold King, Who dar'd aspire their Phraates to attempt. King. By all the Gods, Artaban! Art. The same banish'd Artaban, Led by the Genius that inspires his Soul, Once more has taught his Passions to submit, And, maugre all your former Threats, is come To offer up his Service at your Feet. King. Rise, Noble Man, and let me shrowd my self Within the generous Covert of thy Breast. I'm all o'r shame to be out-done in Honour. Canst thou forget my fell Ingratitude? (Oh curst remembrance, how it racks my Soul!) That drove thee, as a Criminal, from Court: The Words, the Action, every part of that Black Deed is in my Thoughts, and does advance The brightness of thy Character the more. Art. Let that be blotted, bury'd Sir, for ever, In the dull Orb of dark Oblivion's Grave. King. Oh, Let me hold thee in my Arms, thou Son Of War, elder than Mars, What have I seen Those Hands of thine perform. Not he who holds Heav'n's Shaffs of Vengeance could do more. Had it not been for him, we had not been. Our Kind, our Brave, our Valourous Restorer, The Adamantine Locks that keeps, Fates Laws, His Sword can break, and change their Sacred Rolls. Is not this he, that in the Phrygian Fields, When the eager Armies were drawn forth to fight, Rod forth, and bid defiance to the Host; Then, then the Battles joyn'd, and then thy Sword, All crimson'd with their Gore, flung Wounds and Death Round all the scatter'd Troops, and gain'd the day. Art. My little share in that great Conquest, Sir, If any, I deriv'd it all from you. 'Twas your Example, Sir, that led me on: I did but follow where you broke the way. King. Thou art as modest, as thou'rt truly valiant. O, Artaban! What was't cou'd make me hate thee? 'Twas madness, by the Gods, 'twas madness all, To rob my self of my Right Hand, my Life, My Battles, Sieges, Victories, and Fame; I ne'er cou'd end thy Praises, 'tis a Theme Years wou'd want time to finish; but in part Of what I owe thee for Reward, take this: Alinda's thine, and Hymen bless your Loves. [Gives Alinda. Arta. The bounteous Gift's so vast, I blush to think How far my humbler Merit it exceeds. Oh! I'm all Extasie, through e'ery Pore The balmy Joy creeps to besiege my Heart, And drowns the Expressions of my Gratitude. Queen. Oh! I'm undone; it must not, shan't be. [To Eudora. Art. Say, brightest Pattern of the Deities, speak, And let me know what Dowries you expect. Tho' to no Crowns my abject State was born, No joyful Subjects at my Birth cou'd sing An Io Pean to their Infant King; But brought into the World, have always liv'd The Son of Fortune in the Broils of War: Yet, thanks to Fate, the Kingdom's in my Sword. Name in what fertile Soil you'll have a Throne; Be it beyond the Alps, or there where runs Pactolus Streams oe'r Sands of shining Gold. I'll lead my conquering Bands where the bold Foot Of Warriour never trod, oe'r Hills of Snow, Where Summer's Suns ne'r made a chearful Day. Or changing Climates farther Eastward go; Where Nature in her Fire, expiring lies, And the parch'd Earth gapes for a blast of Air: Nay search lost Paradice, and place ye there. Alind. O, Artaban! thy Love's a Throne to me; Enjoying that in some wild Rural Seat, Which mimmick Art did never cultivate, Close by the Mossy Head of some sweet Spring, Whence gentle Streams their murm'ring Cadence make Thro' flow'ry Meads, Green Lanes and whisp'ring Groves. I'd rather live with thee than in gay Courts, Those busie Markets of Revenge and Hate. Art. Oh, I have gain'd the prosp'rous point of Love; Enjoyment scarce it's Measures can encrease: So well agreed, so well our Hearts are joyned, E're Marriage-bonds admit the nearer Ties. King. Thy Vertues do deserve her best returns Nor can she love thee more than I admire. Queen. 'Tis time that we retire, my Lord, the General, By his late Action tired, may want Refreshment. King. E're long we'll meet again; in the mean while, United Joys through all the City smile. [Ex. om. pret. Q. and Eud. Queen. O, my Eudora, faithful Confident, To thee I dare disrobe my cover'd Soul, And lay my naked Thoughts before thy view; Which did I not believe, I'd never tell thee That Artaban's the Object of my Flame. Gods! I confess, that at the first sight I lov'd, The poys'nous Arrow, flew like Lightning through My Veins, and left it's sulph'rous Tincture there. Eud. When such Resolves in Royal Breasts are sent, Thy're Pledges of their own Accomplishment. Queen. Oh, my Eudora, didst thou mark the Lovers? Did you behold their interchang'd Delights? How their Lips mov'd? their swelling Veins boil'd o'er? Their throbbing Hearts Love's loud Allarums beat, As if they'd leave the Lodgings they had got; And in the presence with each other joyn. Eud, Where's the bright Lamp of Reason, Madam, now, Which shone so clear within your Honours Breast? If they too fiercely love, it cannot last. Queen. By all the Sulphur of the flaming Deep, It sha'n't, not an hour, a minute more. Eud. Then Madam, know, I hate Alinda with As great a force as you love Artaban. This, amongst others, take a Reason for't: My Heart burnt once with Fires as fierce as yours, It's Object not unworthy, but unhappy: Press'd with Alinda's Charms, told her his Griefs. She scorn'd, and he, too great to bear it, dy'd. Revenge has since buoyd up my Life, and now. I'll strive to act it both for you and me. Queen. The means? the way. Eud. Leave that to me. But stay, Here's Memnon coming, he's your Lover, Madam, And may be made a useful Engine here. Screw up his tow'ring Hopes, and put Ambition Into the Scale to lift him to our Ends. Enter Memnon. Mem. May I approach you, Madam? Quee. Draw near, my Lord, how do the Lovers do? Mem. They're happy, sure. Quee. They shall not long be so: [Aside. How know you that? Mem. Despairing Memnon's only wretched are, Where Love meets Love, there's an Elizium there. Quee. You always had a Mast'ry o'er my Heart, But yet, the Way's too rough to climb a Throne; Till that be smooth'd, you know my vow'd Resolve. Mem. If done, may I have leave to hope? Quee. You may. Mem. Then shall this Sword before the next Day's Light, Give Death to Phraates, and Life to me. Eud. Methinks, my Lord, 'twou'd be ill season'd then, The very time the Nuptials are perform'd: And shou'd the King be slain, the General May in Alinda's name claim Sicily. Quee. Cou'd we contrive how to divert the Match, Then Courage makes a Queen, and Crown your own. Mem. The Corner-Stone is laid, the Art's to raise The Structure; let me think. Eud. Is the High-Priest to marry 'em? Mem. Yes. Quee. He is your Brother. Mem. And with his Life wou'd serve me. I left him in the Temple now, preparing All things in order to receive the King, Who comes in private to consult the Oracle. Quee. If you cou'd now ingage him how to work The Jealous King in fear of th'angry Aug'ries: 'Tis for your sake and mine, Memnon, be quick; I long to see thy Temples in a Crown. Mem. You are my Queen, and I in all obey. [Ex. Mem. Quee. Choose they who will the smoother Ways to tread, Where the dull beaten Paths of Vertue lead; My Soul's above my Sex, the common Road Befits not me, I'll travail like a God: Where I find none, these Hands shall make my way, And Pleasure only shall oblige my stay. In flowing Extasies consume the Night, My Life shall be the measure of Delight; So may the Hours of all those Lovers be, Who live, and love, and dare to act like me. [Ex. Quee. Eud. Enter Artabandas and Alinda. A Chamber of State. Artab. My dear Alinda, oh, my Life, my Soul, My Happiness, my every Bliss to me; What happy Influence rul'd the Skies to day? How comes your Father, once the cruel Phraates, So kind, so gentle, and so bounteous now? Alin. Is there amongst th'Inhabitants above, A God that bears a Domination there, That can, Knowing thy Vertues, which their Hands did make. So near their own Original, neglect A Care of thee, thou ow'st it all to them. Artab. Thou art all Goodness, perfect Charity; Nor does the Ãtherial Maid that bears that Name, With half thy Beams, and brighten'd Beauties shine; Oh! I cou'd look, and love, and gaze, and live, And bask my self within these Rays for ever: Thy Eye's my Sphere of Light, thy Breast my Globe; My Garden's in thy Face, and in thy Heart my Love. Alin. These are your Infant Raptures, Gentle Strains, An uncloy'd Fancy makes a Posie of, For some short time the pleasant Flowers are Sweet, Beauteous to th'Eye, and Odorous to the Scent; But when the Noon of Life is past, the Toy's Wither'd, laid by, forgot, and soon no more. Artab. Best of thy kindest Sex, restrain these Fears; Our Hours too precious are for Thoughts like these. They shou'd be all Delight and Extasie, No sawcy Care intrude it's Ravenous Look, No dread its paler Face, no Jealousie Its yellow Locks to discompose us now. Alin. Then banish'd let 'em be, it shall be so. Thus in thy manly Breast I'll lay my Head, And in a gentle Sigh thus kindly breath Soft as a whispering Evenings Summers Glade, The next approach unto thy Listening Ear. Artab. Oh my Alinda! thy kind gentle Words Set all my Veins on Fire; the Lambent Flames Their liquid Streams through all my Arteries send: Oh! I cou'd chide the tardy Day, the tedious Night, Which stand between me and my utmost, Joys. Fly, fly, you Minutes, lay your Crutches by, Huddle to Hours, you Hours to Days, and bring Life and Enjoyment to my longing Arms. Alin. This Day has done its share, we owe it much, And may be pleas'd to treat it whilst it's here; These little Lets pay our Delights increase In Expectation, there's its Pleasure found. Artab. This is thinn Dyet to the Hungry Soul. Alin. It is spare Dyet's Meals that make us feed the better, Whilst the pall'd Stomach nauseous Surfeits feel. Artab. Oh! who cou'd surfeit in enjoying thee? Thou art a Counterpoison to all Ills: Misfortunes stand avaunt when thou art near. Alin. Enough, my Lord, the Evening is farr spent: Indeed it's time to part. Artab. But till to Morrow; Then we shall join to separate no more: So have I seen two Sister-Streams that spread, Their Silver Currents from one Fountain's Head, Kiss, and take each their several way, through all The fertile Soyle where their soft Murmurs fall, Till having run their Course, they kindly greet, And in the Sea, their twin'd Embraces meet.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE I. A Temple. Enter King and Queen. King. That Day the Valiant Stranger does Alinda Wed, The Parthian Monarch's Blood shall be untimely shed Away vain Oracles: shall Priests perswade me To forfeit Honour, and betray my Friend? No, I'me resolv'd, let Fate pursue its course, I'le never break my Vow. Ha! You shadowy Phantoms, Airy Nothings; where, Oh whither are you fled, you spitefull Sons of Fear! Nights dismal Haunters! Groans, and no more Sad Dying Groans in lifeless Figures cast: Here, Thermusa, Memnon, Guards Enter Ther. Mem. Lycast. and Guards. Come fling your selves about me, And be my Shields, my Towers, my Bulwarks of Defence Against the Legions of the Prince of Darkness. Where's the Queen? Come hither Memnon, Lycastes, Oh! I'me one piece of Terrour, cold as Ice; My Veins all frozen, like a Northern Sea, Their Spring, and Fall, forget. Quee. You're frighted sure, my Lord. King. Dost thou not see Yon horrid Skeleton, how its Gumless Jaws Chatters; without his Eyes he stares, he shakes His fleshless Fist, and Rattles as he walks? Quee. You fancy, Sir; there's nothing there. King. Ha! Nothing! nothing! why then 'tis gone: T'has spy'd the Horses of the Sun bound o'er yon Mount, Clapt on its Shroud, and dropt into the Grave. By all my Fears the Gods have spoke the Truth, And I must dye to morrow. Quee. How, to morrow! King. Yes, thou bright Partner of my Bed, to morrow. Quee. Ye Gods forbid; your Majesty's in health. King. 'Tis an immutable Decree, I must To all my Glories, Honours, Crowns, Contents, Friends, Loves, and dearest Happiness on Earth For ever, oh for ever, bid a faint Aâlast, a parting sad Adieu to morrow. Quee. Some Melancholly Priest, my Lord, hath had Too near Admittance to thy Royal Ear; Spoke his false Dreams, and rais'd these causeless Fears. Like Phraates, shake them from you; by Heavens There's something in my Womans Breast which holds More Courage than to bend to any Tale of theirs. Mem. Oh how the Poyson works. [Aside. King. When Heaven speaks we shou'd regard its words; Nor have they told me ought, but what from them In Sacred Oracles they learnt, which still declare Fortune's Reverst, Event preposterous, Hurl'd into Being, e'er their Cause is known: Strange Truths ript from the Womb of Time E'er well Conceiv'd. Quee. Tell me, what is't they've said? King. Oh horrour! how I tremble to relate it! That Day Alinda does the Valiant Stranger Wed, Phraates Blood shall be untimely shed. Is it not strange? Quee. Most wonderfull, indeed. King. And to confirm the Truth, glad of my doom My Uncle as I stood, Whom I had long agoe confin'd to Earth, Left his cold Bed, and stole the form of Life. Mem. Fate or his Fancy works with us. [Aside. Quee. But still the Gods are kind, thus to foretell, When yet you may prevent the fatal Sentence. Stay the intended Match.â King. Oh Name it not.

Quee. Besides you may reward great Amanda. Give him a frown t'inlarge his narrower Fate; Load him with Honours, Offices, and Trusts; Put in the Balance all your Friendship's Store; Choose where he will 'mongst the Parthian Court, A Mistress that may suite his haughty mind; Sure this may satisfie his ambitious Thirst. King. Oh spare meâ Quee. I cannot: Gods, Kings, and every petty Mannor'd Lord Will call you Fool and Coward thus to give, In spite of their Advice, your Life and Crowns, Your Daughter, Fame, and me, and all at once, For an Allyance you shou'd rather scorn. King. Thou mov'st me Queen: by all the living Gods, He's dead that doth advise the contrary. Go raise the Court, draw all my Guards about me, I'll stand this shock of Fortune e'er I fall. Hast Memnon, and secure the Princess safe At her own Lodgings, whilst that you dispatch A swift Express to the great King Tygranes; Invite him to Alinda's Arms and Peace; Here take my Royal Signet, and begon: Thus will I close with what my Stars advis'd, Laugh the old Ghost to scorn in years to come, When tir'd with Age, I'm pleas'd t'accept a Tomb. Enter Artabandas hastily with his Sword in Hand, as from Bed. Artab. Ha! Royal Phraates, can you think of Tombs, Whilst your Artaban is your Guard? this Sword Shall skreen your Person from advancing Ills; Your Subjects Treasons, and your Foes designs: Death if sees me shall start back for fear, And seek some other Prey to gorge his Lust: Speak, speak the danger you are inâha! mute, What is the meaning of all thisânot yetâ Quee. The King is discompos'd, 'twere well to leave him. Artab. By all the Lawrels, all the Kindnesses I've in his Service reap'd, I will not stir A foot, till first I know his Enemy. King. Look round thee Artaban; See what all Parthia can afford that's worth Thy Favours, I will give the same, and more To hold thee to my Breast, and keep thee there. Artab. Already you have given me more than in Th'expanded Arms of the wild Deeps lye hid, More than th'Entrails of the Earth can buy, The opulent World is indigent to me, Whilst I enjoy the blest Alinda's Love. King. Oh, thatâ Artab. Yes, that's beyond them all, not Heaven Cou'd add a Grain the Treasure to encrease. King. 'Tis this alone cannot be thineâ Artab. Not mine? Oh all ye Powers above! not mine, my Lord? Rather say kindly that my Life's not so; It's easier Torture to endure the worst, The complicated Strokes of every Ill: Fires, Plagues, Diseases, Sores, and Sicknesses, Wounds, Racks, Dishonour, Deaths and Hell, Than hear the sound of such a killing Word; Sure, Sir, you do it but to try me, your Brows Thus clouded in Storms, cover the Shine That warms the Generative Seeds of all My future Bliss, and my encreasing Hopes; Put on the Day-light of your Eyes again. K. For ever I cou'd smile upon thee, see Thee mounted in my Throne on my Right-hand, Share all my Empire with me; nay, Content Wou'd fill my Soul to be thy Subject made; And this without Alinda ask, and by The Powers that guide the World it shall be thine. Artab. And this without her I wou'd ne'er accept. K. I am too poor to give thee more, yet must, Tho'urg'd by all the Gods, deny thee her. [K. turns to Q. Artab. My Friend, why stand you hush'd, silent as Night, As Infant-Winds in secret Caverns lock'd, And tell me not whence is this sudden change? [To the Lords. Quee. 'Tis brave to be Resolv'd, shake not your Mind, His haughty Fierceness by degrees will cool, And Prudence, Sir, to Temper bring him back. [Aside. Artab. Is that the Reason, 'tis plain Forgery, Meer tampering with the Skies to bribe their Voice, And speak my Ruine;âhear Phraates, hear King, If all the former Services I have done Your Empire, with the weight of those I'm yet To do, may e'er Conjure you, hear me now. [Kneeling pulls K. Robes. K. I will be dragg'd no more: if you are Wise, Accept my offers, for 'tis all I grant. Artab. Can you so soon forget your Artaban, Him, who but yesterday you lov'd so well? Has he so little Interest in your Breast, That a vile Sorcerer, Priest or Devil By Charms or Inchantations thrust His Image thence? oh my too rigid Fate! K. Forbear, and be my Friend, thy Suit's unpleasant, And ne'er can change my Mind; so cease it now, Or see my Face no more. Arta. Ha! Ingrate! Pardon my Love, I call thy Father soâ [Aside. Look o're my Breast, and see the Scars it wears; These Seams torn to defend thy tottering Throne, And tell me, tell me, deluded fearfull King, Have I deserv'd such Infamous Returns? K. Provoke me not, I can be passionate. Arta. Be as thou wilt, I shall regard it not, Thou'st done thy worst, and I defy thee now; Oh Heav'ns, 'tis something sacred in thy Face, Some Features of my dear Alinda there, Which holds my injur'd Hands more than the Guards. K. Against my Person; seize the Traytor. [The Guards draw about. Artab. âStand off. I know not how to yield, nor will learn now. Quee. Oh Heavens! how he looks, a brave disdainâ Strikes like the Darts of Lightning through his Eyes, And kindles in my Breast Increasing Flames. [Aside. K. Sure I have power to tame him; kill him: The Guards fight, and some fall. What will he cut his way to reach my Head? Quee. Hold, let him live to see his Punishment. [They come behind him and disarm him. K. Well, now I hope you'll beg your forfeit Life. Arta. First thou shalt hack me into Atoms. K. Accept it as my Favour then. Arta. Nor thus: My conscious Breast wou'd still Reproach this Arm For all my ill-spent Youth, the Harvest of my Life; My wreathed Laurels wither on this Brow, Which I have gather'd at so vast expence, And often purchas'd at so dear a rate. K. Then for Alinda's sake I grant it. Arta. Alinda's Name can charm my utmost Rage, And Death it self wou'd be a Life for her. K. But with Reserve you never see her more. Arta. Must it be so, then know thy Interest King, Keep this bold Lyon whilst he is in thy toyl, For if he ranges once abroad again, By all the violent Sufferings which I feel, Not all thy Huntsmen with their Warring Spears, Thy Guards, thy Armies, shall e're withstand his force; But in despight of thee will seize his Right, And from thy Bosome, tear it to his own. K. Gods! shall I bear this? thus to be brav'd, Thus dar'd and threaten'd to my very Face, I'th'midst of all my Court, by one disarm'd, Whom with a blast of Breath I cou'd to Death, To vilest Torments in my anger doom? Go bear him off, and if he does presume To tread on this forbidden Ground agen His Life shall pay the forfeit of his Crime. [K. Exit hastily. Arta. And am I thus Rewarded? O Heavens! Who wou'd your Votaries be? Oh feeble Vertue, How thin, how lean, how starv'd are thy Returns? Farewell your Courts, I'le trouble you no more, Let Cowards if you please your helps Implore. [Bore off by the Guards. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Town. Enter Bretton, Lycastes, Castilio Junior, with Officers. Lyc. My Lord, I cannot help complaining at the injust manner of your Proceedings; I do assure you, Sir, I am as much concern'd for the loss of your Daughter as you can be, and on my Honour will join with you in the search of her: Cast. Jun. Pish, pish, ne'er mind him, my Lord, he's a cunning Warener, and has more Burrows than one I dare ingage for him. Brett. I am resolv'd I will not leave a House unsearch'd in the whole City till I've found her. Lyc. I will assist your Lordship, but for you, Sir, I'le call you to an account some other time. Cast. Jun. Prithee what care I what thou dost, what the Devil, when a Man's Mare's broke out of his Ground, won't you allow him the liberty of looking after her? Enter Amadine in Boy's Cloathes. Am. So, Heaven be thank'd, I'me got safe hitherto, let me but come once to the Arms of my dear Lycastes and I am happy; ha! bless me, what do I see! my Father and his Myrmidons! what will become of me? If I offer to go 'twill shew suspicious, I must stand the brunt let what will come on't. Brett. How now, what Boy is that? come hither Sirrah. Am. Then what a most glorious Sight 'twill be, to see me riding upon one of the Horns o'th'Moon; To have my Palace made of Amber, and a hundred little twinkling Stars for my Attendance. Brett. What a Devil is the Boy mad? Cast. Jun. I don't know that, but I am sure his Discourse is above my Understanding. Brett. Harke'e Child, dost thou dwell here in the City? Am. Yes an't please you Sir, but I am going to remove my Habitation: I have an Authority from Jove to be a Cloud-maker, and Juno has promised me an Apartment in her own Court. Lyc. Alas, the poor Child's Lunatick; I think 'twere well to send him to the Hospital of Madfolks till we can learn what Family he is of. Am. Heaven grant you wou'd, for I'me sure I shall be mad outright, unless I escape these watchfull Dragons. Brett. Nay, nay, look ye, my Passion is not so great as to lessen my Charity, and indeed I think my self bound in duty, as I am in Authority, to succour the Unfortunate. Enter Ariene like an Amazon. Hey day, what the Devil have we here? Cast. Jun. Gad I don't know, it's half Fish half Flesh I believe: Lyc. I suppose 'tis one of the Amazonian Ladies lately arriv'd at Court. Ari. Ha! I find the House is beset, Lycastes there, and my Cozen not among 'em? then do I begin to fear every thing has not happen'd right. Am. Well, I'le be going; pray Gentleman, if Juno, Jove, or Mercury inquire for me, tell 'em I am but just gone to Cupid's Palace, and will attend 'em in Counsell immediately. Brett. Here, one of you take the Boy; let him be kept safe in the Hospital, till further enquiry be made of him. Cast. Jun. Ay, ay, don't let us be troubl'd with other peoples Madness. [Exit Amadine. Ari. As I live 'tis she: now Brain assist me, and if I find not some way to fit this Politician, may I dye a Maid when my Mind's brimfull of Matrimony. Your Servant, Sir. Cast. Jun. Your Servant, Sir, or Madam; or Madam, and Sir; for by my troth you may be both for ought I know: Pray, what wou'd you have with me? Ari. You have lost a Mistress if I am not mistaken, Sir. Cast. Jun. No faith Child, I'le answer for thee thou art not mistaken in that; but I'me much mistaken if you can tell me how to get her agen. Ari. Indeed Sir but I can. Brett. How, how's that, Madam? Pray take pity on a poor fond Father, that has lost an only Child. Ari. Your Daughter left you Sir this very moment. Brett. If that be the best of your Intelligence pray do you leave us too; what the Devil have we not been in search of her these 8 hours? Ari. Why that same little thing you thought a mad Boy was Amadine your Daughter. Brett. What, you know her then? Ari. Yes, 'twas I helpt her to make her Escape; but I having since consider'd what a great Grief so loving a Father must of necessity have for so sweet a Daughter, thought it my Duty to acquaint you where she was, that you might justly punish her Disobedience. Enter Simpson. Brett. How now Cozen, what News bring you? have you heard ought of my Daughter yet? Coz. Only this, Sir; we took her Cloathes with a young Youth, who said the Person that left them had a Suit of his in the Room of 'em. Cast. Jun. Prithee peace, the lost Sheep's heard of, come, come, Father-in-law, let's make haste after her, for who knows as mad as she pretends to be, but she may have wit enough to give us the goe-by once agen. Brett. Ay, ay, come Co en and Gentlemen, Mr. Lycastes, we discharge you, and for you, Madam, for this singular Favour, I shall be very proud you would command my House. Cast. Jun. And do me the Honour too Dame at my Wedding. Ari. How now Lycastes, what's the occasion of your Melancholy? Lyc. You have undone me. Ari. What in letting you know where to find your lost Mistress? Lyc. In letting me know I have for ever lost her. Ari. Never trouble thy self for that, but take my word for it thou sha't have her. Lyc. How! Ari. Ariena says it, and it shall be so. Lyc. Ariena! Ari. The very same; come, come, we have no time for Talking, we must be at the Heels of 'em, and if I don't perform my Promise to thee, may I be sixty odd before any Man makes his Address to me. [Exeunt. Enter Artaban, solus, Disguis'd. Arta. The Great Alcides, when of old surpriz'd, Amongst the Lydian Dames his Warlike Limbs, Wrapt in soft Silks, and those unconquer'd Hands Wielding the Distaffe, which that Sword had born, Blush'd less in his, than I in this Disguise. Oh Phraates, I again will see thy Court, Tho' my vow'd Death shou'd meet these forward steps; 'Tis better far to feel, than fear our Fate. Oh Alinda! For thee my Armour to these Weeds are chang'd, For thee my Resolution's barr'd, for thee My very Rage luxuriant grown, is stopt, Like the great Thunderer, tho' his mounted Arms Charg'd with Destruction, aiming at his Foes, By a kind Goddess, whose prevailing Charms Are far more powerfull than his angry Bolts. SCENE II. The Palace Garden. Enter King and Tygranes Discoursing. King. The Clouds, my Lord, must be discharg'd, before The joyfull Sun can fairly guild the Sky; Allow her leave to weep and tell me, Sir, How she receiv'd your Person. Tygr. As I approacht, Her careless Tresses half dishevel'd hung Like Sheaves, with which the Wind had been too bold; Her Head on her bent Arm its burthen le'nt, Whilst from her Eyes those Diamond quarries run, The teary Streams that Dew'd her Rosal Cheeks, Which as they fell bending to kiss her Lips, Her Sighs drove back, to seek their Grave below. King. The Part's too passionate you act, my Lord. Tygr. The Queen of Sorrow ne'er was Dress'd like her, So Beautifull she seem'd, so full of Grace Amidst her Griefs, she might have charm'd a God. She dry'd her Eyes, and with a mournfull Look Beheld me fallen at her Princely Feet. King. Cou'd she be Cruel then? Tygr. My self, my Heart, And Empire, were the Off'rings which I made, But these, alas! too mean for her Acceptance, She with Scorn deny'd; begg'd me to desist My tedious Suit, and give her leave to dye. King. She's unworthy of you, Sir, but must With my Commands to so much Vertue yield. Tygr. Thus on my Knees I beg you, Sir, to use Your utmost Kindness: All the Endearments, which A Father's Breast can to his Child's convey, To charm her Favours in behalf of me. King. Pray doubt it not, nor do I question by degrees T'effect your Ends. She must have time to wean This Darling from her Bosome, her Mind will turn; The Wind that veres to every point of th'Sphere, Is not more changeable than Womans Will; Yet when 'tis settl'd in some Corner Rests, And plays the Sovereign there. Tygr. May that blest Season, Spring of my Hopes, and Summer of my Life, On Time's soft Wings fly swiftly to my Aid. [Discover themselves. SCENE III. A Garden. King. What still a weeping? hath thy Father's care No other Influence than this? The Great Tygranes, whom I have chose the Partner of thy Bed, Waits with a Crown, to adorn thy Virgin Brows. Alind. Oh Royal Sir! My King, my Father, hear me! By all the Loves you ever bore my Mother, By all the Virgins Angels Vows, by those Their Images on Earth do chastly make, Be not so strickt, so hard, so harsh, to use Authority to bend my fixt Resolves, Which like the Centre of the Earth stands firm, But loosen'd once will into pieces burst, And in Eternal Ruines break to Dust. King. These are but feeble Reasons t'avert my Ends, Nor shou'd they move with you; Methinks a Throne Shou'd overrule these little letts, whose Spots, If such some Fools esteem them, by its Rays, Like Tapers in the Sunshine are not seen. Alind. The boasted Grandeur of the Universe, Were it together heap'd upon one Man, Were he a Person where all Beauties met, All Vertues kept their Bank, Learning and Arts, By Nature all his own, wou'd never tempt My Heart in prejudice of him, to whom already All that's mine, is given away. Tygr. Oh Madam, be not so unkind, but bless me (Thus on my Knees I beg it) with one Smile, [Kneels. And dart a Cordial Balsom to my Wounds. Alind. This Posture, Sir, becomes you not, pray rise, And let me beg you hear me. Hear A Harmless, Weeping, Mourning, Dying Wretch, If ever you intend to enjoy your aims, A Mistress that is Kind, Content, or Greatness, Or what you value most, think not of me, For in Heav'ns Face, I Vowâ King. Holdâhear my Vow firstâ By the dread Majesty of Kings I swear; If you consent not to Tygrane's Love, Ile search thy Artaban throughout the World, And all the Gods shall never save his Head. [Exit King. Alind. O Unmercifull! Oh Cruel Phraates! Can your hard Heart no more of Pity hold? Is all your Kindness, all your Oaths forgot? Good Gods! Tygranes hear, By all the Honours, all the Vertues, which You'r feign'd the Master of, by these my Tears, Which ever will disturb you, shou'd I be forc'd, Shou'd I be drove, or ravish'd to your Bed, Constrain me not by Importunities, To forfeit all my Vows.â Tygr. Oh Madam! Words like these stab to the Soul, Feed on my Entrails, Riot on my Heart, And with a Vulture's Rage my Vitals tear. Alind. If such their Influence be, why do you stay Within their Reach? The Fire of Love In narrow Limits pent, grows fierce in its Restraint; Which did it rove at Large, 'twou'd waste, And by degrees, in Lambent Flames expire. Wou'd you but be advis'd, my Lord, in this, Tho' to some dismal Cave, dark as the Night, Where Horrour, and dire Mischief keep their Cells, Brooding on Midnight Tragedies to come, I was confin'd, with patience I wou'd bear The happier Doom, and thank the giving Gods. Tygr. Oh Heav'ns! is there No pleasure in a Throne? To Rule not only Subjects, but their King? To see the bowing Heads, and bended Knees, The Adoring Crowds that wait your Steps? Alind. Alas! poor sounding Nothings: only fit to blind The distant Gazers with an Awe of Power, And keep the Knot of Duty fast; I shou'd Be tired to hear, and see its empty noise. Tygr. Choose then throughout my Realms, a Palace fit To please, or entertain your Sight: I'll leave My State, and all the Ornaments of Power To be your Servant, or your Vassal there. Alind. I wou'd not rob the World of such a Prince, Yet, if I shou'd, you'd soon repent the Change. Tygr. Oh! NeverâNeverâ Alind. Yes, to hear me talk Sad melancholy loving Tales of Artaban, Which I cou'd never help, wou'd grieve you, Sir. Tygr. By Heav'ns you raise A Fire, nought but his Blood shall ever quench; If all my Empires, Crowns, may be a price Sufficient for the Purchase, I will buy his Fate. Alind. And mine â They're so intwin'd together, Nor Life, nor Death can make a separation. Tygr. Will nothing move you? O, e're I Storm, display The Glorious Banners of your peaceful Eyes; Speak a sweet Parley from your Mouth, and bless Me with the sounds of Peaceâ Alind. I can no moreâ [Going off. Tygr. By Artaban, I do Conjure you stay, If all my Interest can't Intreat, I'll use My Rival's Name, to oblige a parting Look. [Exit Alind. Tygr. Kisses her Hand as Artab. Enters. But to Enjoy her all my own; gather The luscious Fruit ripe, from the Noble Stock; For this y'Gods! give me Expressions, which No Tongue e're spoke, or ever Heart conceived. [Artaban discovers himself. Art. Hold Sir, you must not, dare not harbour such A thought so Impious to another's Right. Tygr. Why, who art thouâ Art. His Friend who thou so basely hast disseiz'd, Great Artaban commanded me to tell thee: Alinda, marke me, never shall be thine. Tygr. I'd give a Kingdom for that Traytor's Head. Art. Thou'st tremble at his Sight, turn pale with fear, Tho' Armies were before thee, Towers thy Shield, Mountains and Seas your Separation made; For well thou know'st, he'd force, he'd break, he'd seale, He'd leap them all, to reach at theeâ Tygr. Base Miscreantâ Although thy forfeit Life is in my Power, Yet will I spare it, that thou mayst go back, And let him know to morrow is the Day, I'll in Alinda's Arms, my Bliss compleat. Art. By all the Gods, you ne'er shall see its light; 'Tis Artaban that speaks the Oracle. [Puts off the Disguise. Tygr. Thanks to Almighty Powers thou'rt in my view; Art. And to my Stars, I've found thee, this blest hour So oft as I have sought, so oft thou'st fled: Ignobly, basely hid thy Coward Face, Amongst the common Rout, that makes thy Guard, Or led them in their speed to avoid my rage. Tygr. Proud boasting Man, thou art almost too bad To fall by any but a Villain's hand; My Face wou'd wear more Scarlet than my Sword, Tho cover'd with thy Blood, to take thy Life. Art. That Life of mine is sacred, placed so high In the large Throne of Fame; thy little Arm Can never rise to touch it; as well thou may'st Great Jove in yonder Starry Seat Attempt, And from his Fellow-Gods, discard him thence, Battle his Winds, and stand his Thunder-bolts. Tygr. Draw then, thou proud, thou boasting Fool, and know, Instead of Bulls, and common Offrings, Which every poor Plebeian Marriage grace, In thy hot Blood I'll treat the Deities. [They fight, Tygr. falls. Art. There lie Revenge; next for my injur'd Love, That in Alinda's presence, I will meet And Sacrifice my Life beneath her Feet. [Exit. Art. one way, King Enters the other. Tygr. Oh! I am slain; Life's tottering burthen sinks, And I must die without Revengeâ King. By Heavens thou shalt notâ Oh! he's gone: The Royal Soul is fled, Loosed from its Cage, to flutter in the Air, And mount the Noble Mansion of the Skyes. But thus in Tears I will not mourn thy loss; Give order that the City shut the Gates, Search every House, guard every Passage, On pain of Death, to find the Murderer out, Were he my first, my dear'st only Son, Born to Inherit my Imperial Crown, I wou'd not spare him: No, the Wretch shou'd die, Tho all Mankind shou'd to his Succour flyâ Entreating Gods to save him, I'd deny. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene, A Mad-House. Enter two Keepers. 1st. Keep. Go, carry mad Bess some Meat; she roars like Thunder; and d'ye hear, tie the Parson up: The Moon's in the full, and he has a thousand Pigs in's Brains. Enter Lycastes. Lyc. Save you, Gentlemen; was there not a little Boy brought in here lately? 1st. Keep. Yes, Sir, but for what reason Heaven knows; the Boy seems to me as much in his Wits as I am. Lyc. He is so, Sir, but the Child is under the Care of an Unhappy Father that is stark mad; I have often endeavour'd by force, to bring him to the Colledge of Lunaticks, but cou'd not; therefore I was forced to use this Stratagem; for he loves the Boy intirely, and will follow him any whither. 1st. Keep. Well, Sir, what of this? Lyc. Why therefore I sent the Boy that we might have an opportunity of getting him hither in order to secure him. 1st. Keep. Oh, Sir, let us alone for that. Lyc. There is the Child's Brother with him too, Sir, as mad as the Father; therefore I desire you to take particular care of both, and there's your Entrance-Money, I'll see the rest paid. 1st. I'll warrant you, Sir, we have those as mad as he. Lyc. One thing I had forgot, Sir, when he finds himself Trapan'd, he'll almost murder the Child; therefore I desire you'd let me have him with me. 1st. With all my heart, Sir; here, bring the Boy that came in last. Enter one with Amadine. Serv. Here's the Boy, Sir. 1st. K. Here Child, here's a Gentleman come to set you at liberty. Amad. As I live Lycastes, O happy Deliverance! Lyc. Come my pretty Rogue, your Father's near us; therefore we had best make hast lest we shou'd be seen. 1st. K. No, no, Sir, never fear that; here Boy, shew the Gentleman out at the Back-door. Lyc. Your Servant, Sir. [Ex. Lyc. and Amad. Enter an English Madman. 1st. K. Why how now? Who let this English Madman loose? A Pox on him for coming hither; cou'd he not have kept in his own Countrey. E. Mad. Give me some Drink. 1st. K. Give you some Halter; there's a great many of your Country-men I'm sure deserve it. E. Mad. Give me a thousand Pots, come down on your Knees you Rogues and pledge me. One, two three and four, we shall be merry within this hour. [Exeunt. 1st. K. Go, go lock him up: How now, who comes here? Enter Bretton and Cast. Jun. Brett. Save you, save you, Sir. 1st. K. And you, Sir; have you any business with me? Cast. Yes, Sir, we come to look after a Boy and no Boy; a Wife of mine that shou'd have been; but as the Stars will have it, I'm like to find nothing of the matter. 1st. K. Oh, these I find are the Gentleman told me of: D'ye hear, go and secure their Swords. [The Servants snatch their Swords from their Sides. Brett. Why how now, what the Devil do you entertain Thieves in a Mad-House. 1st. K. Go fetch me a couple of strong Cordsâ Cast. Jun. Cords! What a-Pox, I hope you don't design to Hang us for your Robbery? Enter Servants with Cords. 1st. K. Go, in the first place bind that old Gentleman. Brett. How, how bind me? Hark'e, Sirrah, leave prating and bring me the Boy that was sent in just now. 1st. K. Poor Gentleman, what pity 'tis a Man of his Years should fall under such a Misfortune; d'ye hear, Sir, pray make less stir, and get you to your Chamber. Brett. My Chamber! A Pox o'my Chamber; Prithee where's the Boy? 1st. K. Hark'e Sir; either go in, and quietly, or we have Whips: Do you hear, Sir, Whips? Brett. Whips? 1st. K. Ay, Whips. Cast. Jun. Oh Lord, O Lord, what a Mad Puppy was I to come into a Mad-House? 'Tis ten to one but for their diversion they may whip me too. 1st. K. Go Lash him soundly. Brett. Hold, hold, is the Devil in you? I will go in, Sir, I'll go in very civilly; but good Sir, let none of your Tormenters come to me; you have a good-natur'd Face, those Fellows look like Dragons. 1st. K. Well, Sir, be Civil, and you shall have any thing; but for these two Days you must Eat nothing, 'twill ease your Fits, Sir. Brett. 'Twill starve me, Sir, but I must bear it with a Christian Patience. [They bind him. 1st. K. Come, Sir, now for you; I'll warrant you'll say you are not Mad neither; here bring the Whips. Cast. Jun. Hold, hold, Sir, you'r mightily mistaken in me; not Mad Sir, alack a-day I'm very Mad; I was Born Mad: Why you shall hardly find an English Man madder than I; only there's this difference between us, I know when I'm well, and that I'm sure they'll never do. Enter Lyc. Amadine, Ariena. Lyc. Your Servant, Sir, I must intreat you to unbind this Gentlewoman, and pardon me for making you an Instrument to procure my Happiness. This Boy (as you think) is that Old Gentleman's Daughter, whom I have long Loved, and by your industrious Care in detaining him, have at last Marry'd. Brett. How, Marry'd! Am. Yes, Sir, and ask your Blessing. Cast. Jun. Marry'd! Well, well, I don't care; I'd rather be perswaded out of my Wife than my Wits: I have been Mad only for a small time, he that Marries, perhaps may be Mad all days of his Life: Much good may do you, I say. Brett. Nay, I dare not be angry; for it seems I'm bound to my Good Behaviour: But, Sir, since you are pleased to make bold with my Daughter against my Will, you won't allow me to be Mad without my Knowledge: And tho' your bound your self, pray, Sir, be pleased to free me. Lyc. You have your freedom, Sir. Brett. And you have my Daughter, Sir. Lyc. And that Gentleman has the liberty of choosing where he pleases: Ha, ha, ha. Cast. Jun. What dost Laugh at now, dost know? Why as great a Fool as I am, I an't Marry'd yet, 'Igad I believe your Money can no more keep you from being a Cuckold, than mine can me from being a Fool, as you think me. Lyc. Ha, ha, ha. Cast. Jun. Ay, ay, Laugh on, Laugh on, some rich Men wear Asses Ears, and some wear Horns, and 'gad I don't know which is the more ugly sight o'the two. Lyc. Sir, I desire you to accept of this as part of my acknowledgement for the Service you have done me. 1st. K. Faith, Sir, I'm very glad 'thas proved to your advantage. Brett. 'Igad I begin to have a little liking to the business my self too, for I'm rid of a certain trouble that the Child and that Fool wou'd have brought upon me. Cast. Jun. So, so, I had like to have been made a Madman just now, but since they failed in that, they're resolved to make a Fool of me. Ari. Have you forgot your Niece, Sir, Ariena. Brett. Amadine! What I warrant you had a hand in the Plot too. Ari. Yes, by my troth. Brett. No doubt on't, I always thought you'd make me Mad at last: But come now let's go, your Servant Landlord that had like to have been. Cast. Jun. And I will never think I have miscarry'd, As long as I can say I am not Marry'd. [Exeunt. SCENE, Flat-Palace. Enter Thermusa and Eudora. Ther. The heartless King's Inexorable grown, Nor will he alter his Decree: I saw The dying Ceremonies fixt; the Axe, The Scaffold, the Procession, Guards, and all The Curst Attendants of the Train of Death: Oh my Eudora! Now Night thickens on us; All its pitchy Clouds, gather apace, Inveloping my sight, that I scarce see The fatal Path, I tread, yet I must on, And whilst Lysander Acts his Part, do ours. Eudor. I saw him with your Guards, march toward the Market-Place, The Season suits with our Designs. Ther. Let's call the deadly Sisters to our Aid Hell's rankest Monsters, Envy, and Hate Be Death itself amongst our Train; Nay, Love, The worst when anger'd, of the black Retinue, And then advise who first must feel our rage. Eudor. Mercy and Pity banish from your Eyes. Ther. Alas! They're gone for want of room, my Breast Is full of every Manly Vertue now, And I can strike, where, when, or whom the Fates Or my own Will, the guide of fate enjoyns. Eudor. Then, Madam, 'tis the King must fall, and next The Princess, by Memnon him, and her by me. Enter Memnon. Ther. Oh thou my best, my Bosom Councellor! I hold thee near my HeartâAnd you my Lord Must share it too; 'tis time the Stroke was made; Why should we keep our Happiness aloof, Stand shivering near the brink of flow'ring Joys, When we may plunge into the Depths at once; My Sword, my Heart, all that is Memnon's, Madam, Dispose, and order as you please, I'll fly to obey. Ther. This binds me to thy Interest, this alone, The high'st Token of thy Love, engages more Than all the formal Oaths, the Tears, the Sighs, Which Whining poor Romantick Lovers make. Mem. You add New Courage to my hands, my hopes Thus wing'd, can mount me above the reach of fears, Danger, or Death, or any faint Remorse, Not an Avenging Angel shou'd do more, To serve Heaven's Pleasure, than I'll act for you, The Goddess of my Life, and Heav'n alone to me. Eudor. 'Tis then this hour, my Lord, may crown you both, 'Tis time to act; occasion hates delay, Stars may tell Tales, and our Designs betray. Mem. Think on the Method, Madam, and 'tis done. Ther. That we'll consult within, give me your hand; Thus shall we shoot the mighty Gulf of Fate, Escape the Shelves, and weather all the Storms, The Oceon of our Ends so dangerous made, In these secure, as on the Continent we stand, And may behold the battling Billows war; Their angry Waves in swelling pride arise, As if our safety they'd a mind to attack,â Dash at our feet, and break their little spight. [Exeunt. Enter King with the Princess at his Knees. Alien. Oh my dread Lord! cou'd you but see my heart, As you might hear its Cries, the mangled Piece Bleeding, and torn, twou'd fright, if not affect Your eyes, to some compassionâOh! relenâ King, Hold thy hands, trouble me no more, By all the Gods, I will not hear theeâWhat? In my own Court, whence I'd Proscrib'd the Wretch On Penalty of Life, not only to Return, but with a Villain's Insolence T'attempt to Fight, to Murder my best Friend; Nay, more a Royal Head: By Heav'ns i'll not Bear this; the Dignity of Monarchs, and the Rules, The Int'rest of State, will ne'r admit it. Leave me, I sayâ Alien. O Sir, I cannot:â About your Knees i'll curle these Armes, my Tears Shall wash their roots, and I will growâ For ever here, you shall not stir, or moveâ Without their burthen. Oh be patientâ Think what you'r doing, whilst your anger dooms The best, the bravest of Mankind to Death; Think of his Services, his Lawrels, Sir, His Courage, Fortune, Youth, and Vertues prise: And can you yet be cruel? O no! I see The Parent in your eyes; Love smiles beneath your Frown: Send, and recal the fatal Orders. King, AgainâA wayâI am resolvedâ Alin. Oh let it be to thinkâ That if you thus persist, What will becomeâ Of your unhappy Daughter? You've oft said, Nay, swore you loved her, Sir: And can you see Her plunged in so much sorrow, welt'ring in pains Worse then the flames of Sulpher can inflict? Oh Gods! my Father can't be such a Rock. King, Unhand me, I grow unweildy with thy weight; And shall with fury throw thee hence; can'st thou Take part with any Enemy of mine? By Heav'ns you'd make a Woman of me, Bring down my Purposes t'obey your Will, My Interest, turn and vere, as you shall sigh: Nay, all my Reason in your Tears immerge; By all my Pow'r you shall not; I'll by Phraates still, Lord of myself, and your pitie shall ne'r Stagger my mind, my soul's above its cry, 'Tis Justice moves me, and the Slave shall die. [Exit the King, leaves Alind. on the ground. Alind. Oh, help me Gods! I cry, yet 'tis in vain, your ears, your eyes Are deaf, and blind, to poor Alinda's prayers: Oh barbarous Father, cruel King; curst Stars, That influence thus my Fate.â O passion! tame thy follies, bate thy tears, Why are these needless Off'rings made? To woes like thine, thy Life can only be Their proper Sacrifice â then die Alinda, dieâ [Rises. [The Drums beat a dead March; and Trumpets sound without.] Oh Gods! what is't I hear? Death's dismal sound; The fatal March that leads my Artaban away, To take his last farewel of Earth, and me: Oh! Horror and Distraction to my ears; My Artaban, my Artaban, my Lord [Raving. O mount not yet,â That fiery Chariot, e're you seat me there, Placed by your side, we'll travel o're yon Roads, Those azure Mountains touch, bate with the Stars, Contemn the despicable World beneath, And in the silver beams of chaste Latona's night, We'll find a bed to crown our Nuptial-joys; But oh! where am I?â My Senses start; This Cordial-drop which my long jealous fears Prepar'd for hopeless Love, this healing Balm Shall be my sovereign Cure. T'out-live my Artaban, Is more then all my Woman's strength can bear: I must make haste, I dare no longer stay; Love calls, and the great Summons I obey. [Exit. Town, a Scaffold behind the Flat-Palace. The Scene opens, and discovers Artaban led away by a Procession of Guards, bound to a Scaffold, as he is going,â Art. And must I still be bound, cruel Phraates? Amidst thy Guards, do'st thou yet fear my Arms, These naked Arms shou'd pull thee from thy Throne? No.âSit thee there, I envy not thy Place, Nor wou'd I choose to Live, alas! in Death What is it makes Men tremble so? to me 'Tis welcome as the Harbour to the Seamen, When Beat and ev'n drove a Wreck to the Shore; I see no Horror in it, but a calm Recess From the loud Clamorous Billows which disturb The flow's and ebbs of Life, sure 'tis the Form, The Manner makes them shake; to me 'tis nothing, I've seen it in as diffrent Shapes, as e're The Eye of Man beheld, nay, this the worst I fearl'sly can view, with the premis'd Formalities, the Mockeries, the Pomp, The pageant Infamy of my Fate, And thus to fall is not my Grief; oh Gods! You bear me Witness that I speak a truth; Lead on!â This is the Pedestal by which I mount [As he ascends the Scaffold. To yond'r Throne of Brightness, this the Car In which as Conquer'rs, to Triumph rideâ I go to meet a Palace in the Starsâ I'm ready to obey your Warrant, Sir. [To the Captain. Capt. What sounds are these? [The Trumpets sound as from without; enter Lysander and mounts the Stage; the People shout a Pardon. Art. Who is't I see, Lysander? What's the Message? Lys. 'Tis from the Queen, with which she bids you clear Your passage to Alinda's arms.â Art. Ha! Alinda, saidst thou? Yes, I will live to see herâ Capt. Hold your Orders, Sir. [The Capt. opposes him; Art. fights clears the Stage, and drives the Guards before him. Art. I bear them in my handâ The Scene changes, the King's Apartment. Enter the King, solus. King, Oh Heavens! what mean these Ghostly Fear Why do I stiffen, as if my Destiny Was drawing on!âI beg for ease, and yet Your loads oppress; nay, tho I strive to shake You hence, your Darts still goad me; My pains increase; But where's the hidden Wound? Oh! that's within, a throbbing conscious Guilt That spight of all Resolves upbraids me, with A Life ill-spent, discovers to my veiw, The History of past, and present Crimes; Tells me of Death, of large Accounts to come, And Punishments unknown: What makes you thus Disturb me? Why at present, when i'm well? I have not leisure to contemplate now; My veins are full of youth, my hands are vigorous, The sounding voice of War delights my ears, Bea'ties bright Charms, yet appetites my eyes, Avaunt, and when the reverend Marks of Age My Winter'd Head shall snow, the Crutch support My falling steps, I call you to my thoughts, Sum up my Farwel-Exit to the World, And sink into a Grave of Peace: Oh Gods! Are you still here? Sure there's something else Than barely Apprehension's force in this: My Soul, by its eternal Beams, sees more, Than to the Elements of Sense she speaks at large, Pointing the Effects, but never marks the Cause. If I must die, Oh all the Powers above! Pronounce my Doom, 'twill be some ease to know The utmost Malice of my boding Stars. Enter Thermusa as the King speaks. Ther. Why is my Lord disturbed?â King. I'm feeling for the cause, As Men at Midnight when they've lost their way. Ther. 'Tis strange you shou'd not know it, Sir, and yet Let Rebel Fancy so usurp your sence. King. 'Tis true, I don't Only a mist of things sits hovering here, Sad melancholy Thoughts, faint Chymera's, Such as disturb our Careful Nights, and creep In Slumbers to our Brains, flashes of Light, Which soon in smoaky Shades evaporate, And nothing leave but sulphurous shine behind. Ther. 'Tis much beneath you, Sir, to give them head. King. Thou dost not know, Thermusa, what a weight A tainted Conscience bears; thou'rt Innocent, Thy Hand unspotted; Nay, thy Heart is free, Mine both are deeply plunged in Murtherous Gore. Ther. Granting they have been so; Whence do they now So terrible appear?â King. There I'm to seekâ But yet as Clouds before a Showers approach, Ruffle, and Croud thick in a Grove of dark, These do so too, which makes my trembling Heart Presage impending dangers near my Head. Ther. Your vanquish'd Spirits like a Coward rout, Fly, e're they know for what, till tired they'll stand And miss the cause, they rally then again. King. Oh Empire! had I felt thy weight before, Ambition to my Arms the burthen bore; Not all thy glittering Robes, Scepter, or Fame, Thy boasted Grandeur, and Eternal Name, Shou'd e're my Soul in such a Scarlet dy'd, To glut the hunger of thy tow'ring Pride. Oh! What can wash it white? Rivers and Seas, Are all too shallow for such Blots as these. The Watry Element hath not a Flood, To cleanse the Stain of Paricidial Blood. [Enter Memnon behind and stabs him, he falls. Oh, I faintâ Upon thy Bosom let me lean a while; Oh my profetick fears! Must all my Glories hence their period date? Are there no bars to stop prevailing fate? Then down vast Pile, sink to thy funeral Dust, Your Ruin speaks, th'Almighty Gods are Just. [Dies. Mem. My ready Hands have your Commands perform'd, And thus I run to clasp my blissâ Ther. Hold offâ Mem. How, Madam! Have not my Actions purchas'd yet Your favours? Ther. They have, and I'll reward them, [Falls on the Dead Body, as the Guards enter. Guards, seize the Traytor. Oh my dear Murther'd Lordâ Mem. Am I betray'd? Then Love I blow thee hence; Spirit of Hate drawn from the Lees of Nature, Assist me now, whilst thus I act Revengeâ [Stabs the Queen, Guards seize him. Ther. Curst Villain! But thus thou shalt not brag thy Treachery, Bear him away, and let the Murderer taste The subtil'st Pains e're tortur'd Wretch yet felt, Worse than the Damn'd partake, or Devils invent. Mem. They're Merciful to thee, nor shall I find, In Hell a Fury worse than Womankind. [Carry'd off by the Guards. Enter Artaban, Lysander and Guards. Art. What is the meaning of this Scene of Horrour. Queen. Oh Artaban! E're to the Shades of everlasting Night My Soul its Journey makes. Hear me, I must be short my Summons calls me hence; Love was the cause of this, and Love to thee, Thou best, thou most deserving of Mankind; For thee, Great Phraates fell by my Command; For thee, I met my Fate by Memnon's hand; Alinda was the next that must have fell; Forgive me, and my Death will prove a Blessing. [Dies. Art. Alinda! Was she meant a Sacrifice? What barbarous hand wou'd crop so sweet a Flower? But Oh, her very Name has chill'd my Blood: Lysander, my kind dearest best of Friends, If thou woud'st have me Live, Conduct me to her. Enter Emillia. Emill. Oh, Sir, this Scene of horrour you behold, Comes short of what must follow your poor Alinda. Art. Ha! my heart bodes horrour. Em. Deny'd your Life by her remorseless Father, In wild Despair she took a fatal Draught, That will with racking Torments end her Life. Art. Oh Gods! my fears prove true. Enter Alinda led by two Women. Alin. I burn, I burn, I'm all one Funeral Pile; A flaming Bolt shoots thro' my hissing Veins; Not as young Phaeton's Wheels that drove the Sun and set the World on Fire. Art. Why was I born To see this Day! What will the Gods do with me. Alin. Oh for a Rock of Ice, a Bed of Snow To lull my pains, and hush my sleeping Feaver: Here, take me quick, throw me into the Sea, Pour Oceans o're me, Plunge me, Sink me, Drown me, If all the Waters of the Deep can quench My blazing Mines of Fire. Art. No pittying God! No aiding Power to drop these lovely Ruines. Alin. Stand off, and let me go, I'll mount the Pole, Drive round the Northern Wain, and freeze to a Star. Oh 'tis a Glorious Chariot, ha, ha, ha. Sherumna, Phraates, Artaban, look there, Yonders my Love, Oh 'tis a fine old Gentleman. See how the Grizly Frost, and Reverend Isicles Hang on his hoary Beard a front of Snow, Soft as the Down of Doves, and Cool as Charity. Art. Answer my aking Heart, speak Life my Fairest. Alin. Nay, I have choice of Lovers, if that old dull Winter Fool don't like me, he has a Rival Will be more kind, kind Death: Yes, he'll be Kind indeed; no angry Kings will hinder me From his Embracing Arms; he has a Nuptial-Bed Prepar'd for poor Alinda. Art. Sweetest Innocence Yet speak to thy mourning Artaban. Alin. Ha, my dear Artaban, and art thou come, To hand thy poor Alinda to her Grave! 'Tis kind, 'tis wondrous kind; but how more kindly Had our Stars smil'd, might I have Liv'd, my Artaban! What a long thousand thousand Years of Love Which those dear Arms had given me, have I lost! But I am not so poor; what Earth has robb'd me off, The Gods will give me back: There we shall meet No Rival Queens, nor Tyrant Fathers part us, There I shall mount to everlasting Joys, To Love Heaven and Artaban. [Dies. Art. She's Dead, she's Dead, that Soveraign of my Soul Has left the World and me; and dares this Traytor, This Rebel heart out-live the fatal Blow? No; Love's fair Martyr, thou hast reacht Heaven before me; But thus I'll post to follow thee. [Falls on his Sword. The Eternal Gordian's ty'd; so now no Tyrant's Sword Shall cut these Bonds of Love: Ah my Alinda, I'll find the out in the blest Walk above: In that last Path my Love can never stray, Thy own bright Beams, fair Saint, shall light thy way. Cast. Sen. Farewel, young Hero: Was ever Faithful Pair like this? When these Last Wounds the Seals of Truth and Love they give, How have they Dy'd, to shew us how to Live. FINIS.</field>
