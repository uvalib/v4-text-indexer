      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. MEN. Albert, bethrothed to Charlotte. Sebastian, Friend to Werter. Leuthrop, Werter's confidential Servant. Werter, in Love with Charlotte. WOMEN. Charlotte. Laura, her Confidante. Servants, Friends, Singers, &amp;c. Scene,âWalheim throughout. Time,âA Night and Day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCENE I. WERTER's Apartment. Enter SEBASTIAN and LEUTHROP. Sebastian. Is then my friend so much afflicted? Can Werter be thus chang'd? Leuthrop. Alas! So chang'd of late he's scarcely to be known; Those scenes which once delight'd please no more, No more he seeks the social joys of life, But pines in solitude, and ever wastes The live long day in grief. Sebastian. Such were my fears. For every letter breath'd the said reverse: Can you unfold the cause? Leuthrop. Love is the cause. Sebastian. Ah! then I dread the taleâfor well I know How passion sways my friend.âYet quickly say Who has engag'd his love? Leuthrop. One much too fair, Too rich in virtue's choicest gifts, t'escape The quick discerning eye of kindred worth: Her name is Charlotte, Walheim's proudest boast. Sebastian. And whence arose this passion? Leuthrop. I'll tell thee all; Some few nights past, intreated by a friend, He went to mingle in a revel here, The lovely Charlotte graced the ballâher eye Was fix'd on him alone; too soon he saw And own'd its powerâThence their passions grew, And now each sees how much the other loves. Sebastian. Why then lament? Methinks he shou'd be blest Beyond his utmost hopes.â Leuthrop. O! No, a rival, A generous rival, stands between his love; His name is Albert, and his honour sounds Wherever sounds his name.âHis various virtues Long since endear'd him to Charlotte's friends, And friendship has supplied the want of love, For she has yielded to his suit. Sebastian. Heavens! What scenes of sorrow open to my view; How can I act?âHas Albert heard this tale? Leuthrop. No; he is distant hence, and little thinks How much my master loves; but soon returns To wed his lovely prize, and then your friend Must leave for ever what he holds most dear; Prepare him Heaven for so great a trial. Sebastian. Alas! poor Werter, oh! 'twas kindly done To hide this story from thine anxious friends; Thine own afflictions nobly boded their's. Leuthrop. Yet, when he sees you, he'll unload his heart And pour his sorrows forth.âI know him wellâ Ah! you remember, Sir, the time has been When Werter was the happiest of his friends; Alas! how chang'd the sceneâforgive my tearsâ He has no pang that it not felt by me. Sebastian. Nay, weep not, Leuthrop; happy days Will soon revive.âBut leave Werter approaches. Enter WERTER. Werter. Ha! welcome, my Sebastian! My heart exults to see my friend again. O! to what angel do I owe this bliss, This best of blessings? Sebastian. Thou ow'st it to thy grief; I thought affliction lurk'd in Werter's breast, And therefore came to prove myself his friend. Werter. Would I could thank thee for thy generous thought, For Heaven can witness, that I need a friend. Yes, I've been wretched since we parted last; Pleasure is driven from her late abode, And sorrowâceaseless sorrowâtriumphs there! Sebastian. I know the whole, and much lament thy fate; Yet, Werterâyet there is a way mark'd out To banish all thy cares. Werter. O! name it. Sebastian. Forsake this spot beset with dangers round; Forget the fatal image of thy love, And fly with me to Manheim. There our friendsâ Werter. Go tell the wretch expiring on the rack To think not of his pains: Go tell the Sun To quit its sphere: And when these deeds are done, Then talk of Werter of forgetting Charlotte. If all the charms that virtue can bestow; If all the love that beauty can inspire; If all that's perfect can be thus forgot; Why is it Gods, such excellence is made? Sebastian. Why nurse a passion then thou know'st was vain? Reason should shudder at a thought so wild. Werter. Reason is banish'd from a lover's mind, For love admits of no associate there; Had icy apathy congeal'd my soul, It must have melted at my Charlotte's looks. My friend, such looks! as pitying angels give To dying saints alone, Sebastian. Yet, had reason reign'd 'Twou'd place a dismal prospect to thy view, 'Twould tell thee to avoid the gathering storm That must be fatal, if not quickly shun'd. Werter. Oh, I am grown so careless of myself, Nor storms, nor dangers can appal me now; Place me alone 'midst hot Arabia's sands; Leave me unclad 'midst freezing Zembla's snow; Find me where mortal never trod before; And only tell me that my Charlotte loves, And hopeless Werter shall be happier far, Than monarchs glittering on triumphant thrones. Sebastian. Has love then banish'd honour from thy breast, Or art thou senseless of the wrongs design'd The generous Albert! That, that alone Should check thy boasted transports. Werter. O, my friend, Thou'st touch'd the cord that sounds to all my woesâ To that alone I owe my present pangs. Sebastian. Ah, he begins to soften into reason. Werter. O, had my rival borne a worthless name, Or us'd deception to obtain his suit, Or play'd the villain in a single act, I'd not have yielded, or suffer'd thus; But Albert is the gentlest, best of men: Yes, he has shewn such nobleness of mind, Such truth, such honour, and such generous love, That by my soul! I'd rather be despis'd By her I idolize, than injure him. Sebastian. Mysterious heaven! why is a soul so good Tortur'd with pangs the bad alone should feel? Werter. He is so honour'd and esteem'd by all, That though my rival, he must be my friend. Yes; I will emulate his noble virtues; Convince him Werter merits his esteem, And shew Sebastian that my honour's safe. Sebastian. Werter's himself again! and reason now With double force returnsâWilt thou forgive The rash expressions that my harshness dropt? Werter. To sue forgiveness is for me, my friend. My joys, when joy did revel in this breast, Became more dear when shar'd by my Sebastian; But when his friendship would partake my grief, I owe him much indeedâand much I fear I never can requite him. Sebastian. Ah, how blest, How well rewarded would Sebastian be, Could he but think he came not here in vain? Werter. Of that hereafterâI must leave thee now, To pay the summons of inviting love: Oh, I am wandering to a paradise, Where fruits ambrosial bloom! which heav'n has doom'd Fatal to Werter as the tree of old! [Exeunt. SCENE, Charlotte's Apartments. Enter CHARLOTTE and LAURA. (Charlotte, reading a letter.) Albert returns to nightâhe little thinks What ravages a few short hours have made In this distracted breast: Laura, he comes To take possession of my promis'd hand, And claim that love his virtue well deserves! How will his hopes be dash'd then, when he finds That all the labours of three tedious years; One night, one fatal night, has quite eras'd. Laura. Banish these thoughtsâthey serve but to enhance The sad remembrance of an hopeless love, Charlotte. Talk not of love, it has destroy'd my peace: O, had not Werter's lovely form appear'd, I still had liv'd unconscious of these pangs! And Albert's friendship Werter's love supply'd; But he has shewn the God in all his charms, With each allurement to seduce the soul, And then has left me to deplore and die! Laura. Think not of Werterâ'Twas thy solemn vow To wed with Albert. Charlotte. And I'll maintain that vow; Think'st thou that honour will descend to kneel At love's fantastick throne? No, Laura! no; Albert deservedly has gain'd my heart; Some sighs may heave, some tears in pity fall, When memory muses on another's fate; But truth and constancy shall never cease To pay that debt the generous Albert claims. Enter WERTER. Werter. My better angel!âO, at sight of thee, The gloomy winter in my bosom thaws, And sunshine smiles again. Charlotte. O, Werter! Werter. What means my Charlotte? Charlotte. Alas! my Werter, There in that letter read thy hopeless fate. Werter. (having read the letter.) Albert return to night!âThen am I curst indeed. Charlotte. Wou'd I could sooth the anguish of thy soul; But well thou know'st honour denies thee that Which best might give reliefâyet, if the balm Of healing pity will assuage thy pain, Still thou art somewhat blest! for even nowâ My heart is bleeding for the wounds of thine. Werter. Generous Charlotte!âbut oh! what needed this? If sympathy could heal my rankl'd wounds, I knew that thou would'st pour the balsam on; 'Twas madness only that has made me thus, And only that can save me! Charlotte. No, Werter; 'Tis Charlotte only that has made thee thusâ She is the origin of all thy woes! Werter. Perish the thought!âI am myself the cause, Thou art the lovely soother of my cares; My guardian angel! sent by pitying heav'n To compensate my every other ill;â And yet there is another that should claim My warmest gratitude. Charlotte. O shun me! fly me! I am a syren fatal to behold, And ruin those I ever should protect; Sure heaven has made me only to destroy. Werter. Tell me delusion lurks beneath thy smiles; Tell me destruction works within thine eye; Tell me contagion hangs upon thy tongue; And I will still love on, and still be happy: But when thou tell'st me to avoid that form, Death has no terrors! hell no pangs like mine: Ah, whence those cruel fears! Charlotte. Thou best of men, For thee they fallâanguish must have its vent, Or the heart's blood would gush. Werter. If I have liv'd To give one moment's misery to thee, That moment I have liv'd too muchâBy heaven! The frantic thought of adding woe to her, Drives each ungenerous selfish sorrow hence, And shews me what a shallow soul I have: Oh, cease to weep, in a far worthier cause; Thy sorrows might be shed. Charlotte. Never, Werter. When virtue, such as thine, is tortur'd thus; When love, the purest, is so ill bestow'd, And noblest talents are in love so lost, The sympathizing heart may surely melt; And melting thus, may pour its wishes forth: Fly then far henceâseek some more generous fair; One who is worthy of a heart like thine! And shou'd she ask the story of thy life, Tell her, that Charlotte did abuse thy love: Tell her, the only recompence she shew'd For all thy sufferings wasâto leave thee thusâ My heart no longer can support its pangs! [Exit. Werter solus. If ye have mercy Gods, O shew it now! For never wretch did want your mercy more. But holdâHow shall my troubled mind resolve If I remain?â'tis but to marr her peaceâ 'Tis but to check the generous Albert's bliss: If I depart, the pain is all my own! Where is that virtue then? that boasted honour, That ever was my pride? O, shame, 'tis fled, And Werter's but the shadow of himself! Yet will I shew some firmness still remains, And shake these demons from the dens they haunt! Yes, I will leave herâe'en now I'll seek my friend, Take one short farewell and depart to-night! So may I live to bless that happy hour, When honour nobly triumph'd over love! [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE ALBERT's Apartment, Enter ALBERT. Enough is known; and I with pity see A youth the noblest, struggling to subdue A generous passion; whilst I in peace possess The valued treasure he so much admiresâ As the disturber of another's peace, Honour compels me to attempt relief. Enter CHARLOTTE. Albert. At length the wish'd for moment is arriv'd? At length I clasp thee in a fond embrace! Charlotte. Oh, 'tis an age since last we met! Albert. The pangs of absence have indeed been great. Yes, most severeâBut I'll no more complain; Propitious heaven has granted all I ask'd; Has yielded thee, the summit of my hopes! And we shall part no more. Charlotte. May heaven so grant! Albert. Why those doubtful words?âand why that pensive look? Oh! had I thought of meeting thee in grief! The pangs of absence never had been borneâ 'Twas the fond prospect of our future bliss, That only cheer'd my pains! Charlotte. Alas! my Lord, When the great secret in my breast is known, You will not wonder at my present griefâ Perhaps you'll think I merit all I feel; And wound me with reproach! Albert. Banish thy fearsâ I know that secretâI approve its cause: It adds new honour to the best of hearts; And makes me worship, where before I lov'dâ Oh, if that only interrupts thy peace, Thank heaven! for Albert can dispel thy grief! Charlotte. Heavens is it possible?âYes, 'tis Albert; The same unalter'd Albert I esteem! Albert. And, could'st thou think that Albert was so base, As not to sympathize in Charlotte's woes?â I scorn suspicion, and its jealous train; 'Tis only nourish'd where pollution lives. For ever, in the pure unspotted breast, The poisoning canker starvesâBut Oh, my Charlotte! Long have I known thy honour, love, and truth; Have seen these jewels stand such trying tests, That when I doubt themâmay I cease to live! Charlotte. Who could be false, when truth is thus esteem'd?â Albert, there need'd not my truth alone, To make thy peace secureâfor had I wish'd To prove unfaithfulâI had wish'd in vain. Werter had scorn'd me for a thought so mean, For oh! his honour only stoops to thine. Albert. Then as his honour has preserv'd my peace, Mine shall instruct me to restore him hisâ Yes; I wish shew this all excelling youth, That Albert never was outdone by him. I'll seek his friendship, and his sorrows share; And, if my Charlotte shall approve the thought, Entreat him to remain and share our bliss. Charlotte. Our bliss will yield but little ease to himâ Absence and time, can only cure his woundsâ But see he comeâpermit me to retireâ My presence will but add to his distressâ All Albert's wishes are sincerely mine. Exit. Enter WERTER and SEBASTIAN. Werter. Ha! Albert hereâ'tis him I would have shun'dâ Albert. Is this the Werter I have heard so prais'd? Is this the youth I wish'd so much to view? Yes, yes it isâfor heaven has kindly stamp'd The picture of the mind upon the face!â Come to my arms, thou honest, noble youth. Wrrter. My heart o'erflowsâI know not how to thank This generous kindness! Albert. Oh, I have heard thy worth! Thy various virtues have been told me all, And lovely Charlotte has enhanc'd the tale. Yes, she has praised thee with such ardent warmth, That my heart panted to embrace the man, So much esteem'd, by her I most adore.â Werter. Has Charlotte told thee? has the lovely Charlotte Told Albert this? O, for this generous act, May blessings, numerous as her virtues, fall To make her life a heaven!âBut ah! her praise Is little due to Werter. Albert. Not due to thee! Then when shall merit meet its just applause? If to have lov'd, where 'tis a charm to love; If to have struggl'd, to subdue that love. (When honour only urg'd thee to the thought,) And not subduing, to have nobly fled; Leaving behind the Eden of thy soul. If this is worth! if this deserves applause! Who then shall claim, or merit more than Werter? Werter. By heaven, 'till now, my heart ne'er dreamt of praise: For only in itself it sought applauseâ But at this moment, it expands with pride, Since it is applauded by the man it loves! Oh! it would rather hear his honest praise, Than all the tributes of a flattering world! Albert. How could I curse my own inferior soul! That checks me from repaying such perfectionâ Werter, alas! only thought occurs, One only prospect to my wishes dawns, To sooth thy anguish, banish Charlotte's fears, And make me blest indeed! Werter. Oh, name it then. Albert. Delay thy journey, and remain with us. Werter. Heavens! This stings me to the heartâthis wounds me more Than all the agonies of keen reproach: Yet, it shall only strengthen my design, For I will prove I am not quite out-done. Albert. Let not thy hapless passion drive thee hence: It is a love so pure, so void of guilt, That other passions might supply its loss. From Charlotte's friendship you may surely gain. The very pleasures thou hast hop'd from love; For friendship's but another name for love, When love's so pure as thineâCome, come, consent Myself will mingle in the social scene; One common interest shall embrace us all, And thus united we may smile at fate. Werter. O, thou'rt worthy of the praise thou'st won! Thus in the moments of the highest bliss To think of me, a wretch so wholly lostâ Shew such compassionâpity my weakness; (weeps.] I can't support the anguish of my soul. (turns up the stage.] Sebastian (coming forward.) Thou generous man! a moment turn to me; Look on his sorrows, and with pity think How much his friends endure, how much they wish To take a long lost favourite to their arms: Soften his sorrows, and restore his peace. Oh think on this, and soon thy gentle soul Will cease to pour its liberal wishes forth; Will cease to lure him from our only hope. Albert. Think not I mean to lure him from his friends: 'Twas the fond wish of soothing his afflictions That only made me speakâbut since I see The happy prospect of returning peace, That wish is well fulfill'dâI thank thee much, And will no longer urge him from his purpose. Sebastian. How will the friends of Werter worship thee? How will they pour their blessings on the man? Who spurning jealousy made him his friend Whom love had made his foe. Albert. Name it no more; I'm amply paid in acting as I ought, And shall retire well pleas'd.âFarewell,âand yet, 'Tis most ungenerous to leave him thus: Thus sunk in sorrow, when perhaps a smile From soothing Charlotte might revive his hopes: Ah, look!âit willâhis glances say it will! Werter. Why, can't I speak, and tell him what I feel? Albert , (to Sebastian.) Wilt thou consent? Sebastian. Alas! I dread the scene. Albert. O do not fearâshe shall not know his purpose; I will deceive her with the flattering hope Of his remaining here, and thus prevent The conflict that alarms thee. Sebastian. Well, I submit. Albert. Oft have I felt her soothing power myself, And therefore know how much she can relieve: Come then my friend, (taking Werter by the hand) together let us haste To that bright heaven that we both adore. Sebastian (to Werter.) I shall expect thee at the Western gate An hour e'er mid-night. Werter. I will attend thee there; 'Till then, farewell.âO what a wretch am I, That have not power to make one poor return For all this wond'rous goodness?âYet, Albert, Think me not always thus!âthe time may come When wretched Werter shall deserve thy praise. [Exeunt. Sebastian (solus.) Heavens, with what wonder have I view'd this scene: A rival pleading in a rival's cause, And both contending who shall most excell: Werter, I know is fix'd in his design; How well rewarded is Sebastian then? Soon shall he see the gathering storm disperse, And sunshine beam upon his friends again. [Exit. SCENE,âAlbert's Garden by Moon-light. Enter WERTER. How oft this gloomy solitude has pleas'd; How oft yon valley been the scene of bliss: Ah me!âit calls past pleasures to my mind; Pleasures! I fear that never will return. Such is the fate of manâI murmur not. Of these bright flowers that gild the scene of life, How many fade unnoticed and unknown? How few by fruit succeeded? and that fruit, How rarely does it ripen? yet, alas! The little which is ripen'd. and remains, We still allow to perish and decay. [turn up the stage. Enter ALBERT and CHARLOTTE. Albert (to Charlotte aside as they enter.) Yes, I much hope our wishes will prevail: He seem'd reluctant, but some careless words Betray'd consent. Charlotte. I do not doubt it, Albert; And as we wish to dissipate his woes, Say not to-morrow is our bridal dayâ I know 'twill wound him much. Albert. O do not fear; I would not wound him for the world's wide wealth. [Here they turn to Werter.] Come, Werter, let us contemplate the sweet Beauties that surround us How sweet the solitude of this retreat; 'Tis solemn silence allâand yon pale moon, That dully glimmers on the passing stream, Compleats the awful scene. Charlotte. Yes, 'tis most awful, And ever when I walk by Dian's light, A musing melancholy wraps my soul, And memory ponders on departed friends: On friends! I never shall again behold! O, Werter, shall we converse after death? Shall we in unknown climes again exist, And once again be known? Werter (in agitation.) Charlotte, Charlotte! Here and hereafter we shall meet again. Charlotte. And do the buried know the living's thoughts? Are they partakers of our various scenes? Oh, if my long-lost parent could be told, That I my proffer'd promise had fulfill'dâ To be protectress of her children's youth: Could she be witness of the social love, The mutual harmony that now subsists, How would she worship that great power above, Whom in her dying prayers she so implor'd For our protection! Albert. These thoughts, my Charlotte, May please remembrace, yetâ Charlotte. Oh, Albert! You well remember her exalted soul, And oft have wonder'd at its various charms! Oft call'd her generous, chearful, mild, and fair: And heaven can witness she deserv'd thy praise.â Ah me!âhow often have I vainly pray'd To be the image of such great perfection. Werter (throwing himself at her feet.) Thou art that image, 'tis by heaven proclaim'd! The gods own blessings, all thy mother's charms, With double splendour grace an angel now! Charlotte (laying hold of his hand.) You should have known her, Werter: Yes, she was worthy to be known to thee! A heart so good, deserv'd a friend so great:â Yet, in the mid'st of happiness and life, She was to perish, she was to be lost. Alas! how hard to part with those we love? Werterâ'tis sharper than the stings of death. Werter. Charlotte, 'tis more than nature can support! 'Tis agony extreme! 'tis horrible to think on!â Gracious powers above! Why am I tortur'd with these questions now? Albert. Be patient, Werter; let not reason yield To these tumultuous transports of the soul! Werter. Fools may be patientâmy controuling woes Shall ne'er be silent; they must roar aloud, Else my expanding heart would burstâAlbert. Thou hast not drank of sorrow's bitter cup, Thou hast not borne the miseries of love, Nor felt one agony that Werter feels! Oh! if thou had'stâthou wou'd'st invoke the gods, Thy ceaseless groans would be as loud as mine, Thy madnessâraging madness!âwild as mine! Albert. Werter, farewellâ'tis time we should be gone. Werter. And can'st thou leave me on the brink of fate? Can Charlotte leave me like a wretch cast off Stay but a momentâoh, one parting look! Am I so lost she will not grant me that? I am contentânow leave me to my fate; Farewell to both!âand may you never bear What I have borne?âbut we shall meet againâ 'Tis not for ever that we now divide. Charlotte. No, for to-morrow we will meet again. Werter. To-morrow, Charlotteâ;oh! oh! oh! Albert. Werter, farewell! Some pitying angel guide thy steps, And sooth thy soul to peace. [Exeunt Albert and Charlotte. Werter solus. She's fled!âthe image of my soul is fled! My other self, my only refuge's gone! Then what remains for Werter butâdespair. Now grief! now sorrow! I am all thine own. Ye shades of night! expand your sable wings, Cover in darkness a deserted wretch! Hide him from heaven, the world; and from himself! Here let him fall forsaken and forgot, And sigh in solitude his life away! [Throws himself on the ground. Enter SEBASTIAN and LEUTHROP. Sebastian. I fear the generous Albert has prevail'd, For I have waited at the gate in vain:â This way I know they metâAlas! how's this? My friend upon the ground!âand senseless too! O, Werter, speak! Werter. Away, I'll perish here. Sebastian. Look up my friend!âthy lov'd Sebastian calls, Perhaps he brings thee peace! Werter (starting up.) Who talks of peace?â 'Tis not to be found!âThe Cherub sits on high, And smiling mocks mankindâpursue it not, For it will lead thee to a dangerous sea, And there will vanish!âRather, thou like me, Plunge deep in sorrow! millions of fathoms deep; And gorge upon despair!â'till satisfy Thy hungry soul, and leave it nothing wanting! Sebastian. Oh, heaven! the thought of leaving all his soul holds dear, Has, for a while, depriv'd him of his senses: We must delude him hence. Werter. Look, look, and read; 'Tis fate's dire volume! and on the bloody page, Self murder's doom'd damnation!âand see! around Avenging demons wait to lash their prey.â Hark, how they yell!âand now they pullâthey tearâ O, torture! torture! (falls on Leuthrop, and is supported off.) [Exeunt, END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE III. A grand Apartment in ALBERT's House. ALBERT discovered amongst his Friends. Albert. Most welcome all!âO this kind friendly sight! Doubles the pleasures of the bridal day, And gives to Albert purest happiness! But not alone to himâall, all shall share itâ For Charlotte like the fun, her power exerts; She shines with equal lustre upon all; Warms each cold heart, and chears each languid soul. This day has made her mineâand for that gift It shall be chronicl'd most sacred here! But wherefore comes she not? Enter LAURA. Albert. My gentle Laura, Where is the truant bride? Laura. Alas! my Lord, I left her musing on the hapless tale Thy kindness had conceal'dâBut now she heard That Werter fled last night. Albert. Then could I share her grief! For still I hop'd wishes would prevail. Enter CHARLOTTE. Albert. My lovely partnerâ Charlotte. Pardon, my Lord, This long neglect, but.â Albert. Nay, name it notâ These friends are come to mingle in the general joy, And share your Albert's bliss. Charlotte. They are most welcome. Albert. Now would the measure of my joys be full, Was there not wanting to compleat my hopesâ Charlotteâour mutual hopesâone honest friend! One, whose aspiring virtues would have charm'd Each heart to raptureâone, whose noble spirit Merits of Albert.â Charlotte. If thy Charlotte's peace, Or that her happiness be worth a thought, Never, O never name him! Let the fatal sound Sink in oblivion! so shall our mutual peace Rise to perfection. Albert. I have no more to sayâ Let music sound! Here follows the EPITHALAMIUM set by Mr. RAUZZINI. (appointed) Albert (to Charlotte, observing her sad.) Music was won't to elevate your soul, And double every joy!âwhy has it lost its charms? Charlotte. Oh, it recalls past actions of my life! And brings to memory those unhappy thoughts That ever pierce my soulâbut, Albert, once I had no sorrowsâonce no bitter thoughts To wound reflectionâthen the lively sounds Added new pleasures, and my ravish'd heart Bounded with joy!âbut nowâ Albert. Nay, it is not kind, Thus to be mourning on the happy day That makes thee mineâI shall in truth complain. If sorrow thus engages all your thoughts, And none are left for Albert, or for love. Charlotte. 'Twas but a sudden weakness of the soul, Which now is fledâbut oh! thou generous man. Think not I mean to sorrow at the fate That made thee mine.âNo, by you powers above, I would be not else but what I am, To be the mistress of a monarch's love! Albert. And I would rather of thy gifts partake Than share the pleasures of the fairest fair, That yet trod earth. (A servant enters and whispers Albert.) Albert. We will attendâmy friends We're summon'd to partake the feastâlead onâ Let sorrow's vapours now disperse away, And general pleasure crown this festive hour. [Exeunt. Flourish of music. SCENE, WERTER's Apartment. Enter WERTER and LEUTHROP. (Werter giving Leuthrop letters.) These to my motherâfrom Sebastian theseâ Get them convey'd and meet me here again, And mark meâthat I prevail'd upon my friend Not to depart from Manheim 'till to-night, Must be divulg'd to none. Leuthrop. I shall obey, sir. Werter. How goes the night? Leuthrop. 'Tis near the second watch. Werter. Then, time, I must no longer trifle with theeâ Something must be doneâand that most quicklyâ Yet, what is to be done?âO, 'tis an awful Moment! and I must use it like a manâ Away, and leave me. Leuthrop. His disorder'd speech, And the wild fury in his looks, foretell Some new misfortuneâI will not leave him. (goes up the stage. Werter (pausing.) Death is the common medicine for woeâ The peaceful haven, which the shatter'd bark In tempests ever seeks.â'Tis but to raise The curtain, and another scene succeedsâ Then why delay'd?âwhy yet these doubtful fears? Oh! 'tis the mind that shudders at the thought Of dark uncertainty! Leuthrop (coming forward.) O, Sir, forgive the ardour of your slave, Who rudely thus intrudesâbut much I fear Some new affliction wounds my master's peace, Which I perhaps can lessen or avert. Werter. Away! away! Leuthrop. O do but try me, sir! I would walk bare-foot o'er the boundless world, And every step that wrung my aged feet, Should be a shoot of comfort to my soul, Could I but mitigate my master's woes? Werter. If thou would'st shew obedience to my will, This instant leave me, nor increase my pain. [Exit Leuthrop. (pausing again.) Yet in this world can I e'er hope for peace? Peace!âwhen my Charlotte is another's wife. E'en now perhaps she languishes away, And melts transported in her Albert's arm.â Ha! that dread thought works inward on my soul Like darting poisonâand my mad'ning brain Is swell'd with desperationâO, 'tis an hour Of horrors! and it calls for horrid deedsâ One of the three must dieâthat heaven decreesâ Shall it be Albert? shall these yet spotless hands Shed virtue's blood? and shall the honest fall, To let the guilty take their happier seats? O damn'd thought!âI shudder at myself, For bare imagination of the deed! Shall Charlotte then?âshall that sweet angel form Be tornâbe mangledâand in Werter's cause? Oh, cruel! cruel fate!âI'll pause no moreâ One thought alone possesses all my soul, And that shall be obey'dâWerter himself shall die! This long has struggl'd in my wither'd brain, And now it bursts, and my whole soul's at peace! In such a glorious cause who would not fall? Now, Albert, live! and bless that perfect fair, For whom I liv'd, for whomâI soon shall dieâ And, Charlotte, when the grave holds all that's left Of that unhappy agitated being, Who knew no pleasure but in sight of thee! Oh! when you wander thro' your long-lov'd vale, Then think of Werter!âthink how oft his sighs Have fill'd the sounding woods!âhow oft his tears Have dew'd the weeping grass!âand if you wish To feed on sorrows never tasted yet! Look!âtowards the church-yard that contains his bones, And see! with pity, how the evening breeze Waves the high grass that grows upon his grave! Alas!âthese thoughts recal such tender scenes!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. SCENE ALBERT's Apartment, Enter CHARLOTTE and LAURA. Charlotte. If dreams are ominous, some dreadful woe Is not far distant, Laura, from thy friendâ For even now opprest with heaviest care, I sought for comfrot in a short repose; And my wild brain was harrassed with a dream So terrible ! that it will banish sleep For ages from my soul. Laura. O, heed it not! It can portend no harm. Charlotte. Hear then, and judgeâ Methought! alone and in the dead of night, Whilst light'ning fill'd each pause the thunder made, And the pale moon in the blackest clouds was lost, I wildly wander'd to that dreary valeâ That vale! where Werter first confess'd his love, And oft in secret sigh'd!âBut to my taleâ The light'ning's fire, and moon's few scatter'd rays, Just shew'd the awful horror of the scene; Loud roaring waves rush'd o'er the fertile fields, And the whole valley seem'd a tossing sea. Sad echo doubl'd every hollow sound, And nature with complete disorder groan'd! Laura. How could your fancy form so wild a scene? Indeed 'twas terrible! Charlotte. But mark the end, The fork'd light'ning flashed a sudden glare; And far, far off, a towering cliff appear'd! Urg'd, at the moment, of a secret wish To gain its summitâin the flood I plung'd! And driven by the torrent, reach'd its footâ Loud hollow'd the wind, the tempest still increas'dâ Tremblingâsad omen! I began to climbâ And midway sawâoh, horrible to tell!â An human being, on the highest verge, With arms outstretch'd, propending o'er the deepâ I scream'd aloudâstruck with the sudden noise; He startedâmadening I flew to his relief, And saw with eyes, as frantic as his ownâ The lost, deserted WerterâO Laura! I wak'd in terrors, and centuries of time Can never wear the image from my mind Enter ALBERT. Albert. And still will Charlotte fly her Albert's arms? Still will she leave him to lament alone? Oh! if my soul could find a secret charm, That gently could attract thy heart to mine, Or gain me but a share of that dear treasure! High heaven itself would be a poor conceit Of Albert's happiness! Charlotte. Nay, talk not thusâ It stings me to the soul, to hear thee chide. Love's deepest wounds, affliction's sharpest pangs, Would be indulgence to reproof from thee! Albert. Thou little know'st How thou art rooted here!âin early youth, Thy lovely form first planted in my soul; There long it liv'd, and charm'd my wandering senses; But nurs'd by time it grew into esteemâ And friendship budding blossom'd soon to love: The fruit, alas! has not fulfill'd my hopes; But, oh! the plant is firmly rooted here, And here shall flourish 'till the stock decays! How can'st thou wonder then that thy sad eye Attracts unwilling frowns from mine! Charlotte. Oh, Albert! E'er this thou should'st have known, 'tis Charlotte's fate, To torture most, where most she means to please. Albert. Be what thou wilt. Be pleas'd, be silent, be content or sad, I will still love thee, and be blest to share Thy pleasures or afflictionsâbut come, my life! I came to tell thee that some sudden news Compels me hence until to-morrow noonâ 'Tis hard to part so long! Charlotte. Alas! my Lord, What news so suddenly can force thee hence? I hope no ill at Francfort! Albert. None, my fair; I am compell'd to hasten to the courtâ No common mandate forces me away: But I have doneâin this one fond embrace, Let my farewell be known!âe'er noon to-morrow I shall again my only joy behold! Charlotte solus. Farewell! and may the unrelenting heavens, That show'r down curses on this wretched head, Lavish their blessings on the generous Albert. Oh! how my soul still struggles to forget What most it meditates, what most it loves! But ah! how vain! still 'midst the dying embers Of smother'd passion, some decaying spark Kindles the latent fire, and by the conflict fann'd. Soon it expands o'er all the healed soul, And blazes fierce again!âO, Werter, Werter! Yes, I may blame thee, but never can forget thee; A sacred sympathy attach'd me first. Time since has stamp'd thine image on my heart, And the impression is engrav'd for ever! Should we e'er meet again;âdeluding thought! It thrills like light'ning through my trembling frame, And penetrates my soulâha!âWerter! Enter WERTER. Werter. That very wretch! Charlotte (turning away.) Some kind protecting angel guard me now! O watch me at this awful moment! Werter. Heavens! Is it possible?âcan she abandon me? Sheâwho would smile if Werter was but pleas'd! Sheâwho would weep if Werter did but sigh! Charlotte. We must not be aloneâ The scene is alter'd since we parted lastâ Laura, I sayâyet holdâa moment holdâ Am I so lost that I distrust myself? So mean, so cowardly! must I be watch'd Lest I prove false?âHence, idle visions, hence! I am alone protectress of myself, And dare defy all love's seducing arts, To shake one atom of my virtue! Werter. Oh! It was not always thus!âthe time has been When Charlotte would have flown to sooth her Werter: But now 'tis well!âhe'll trouble her no moreâ He came oppress'd with sorrow and despairâ Yes, almost broken with a weight of woes, To seek for succour in his only hope. Like one that's shipwreck'd in a dreadful storm, Struggling he sought the last remaining plank To save his sinking soul!âbut that avoids himâ Even there his hopes are lostâthen let the storm Come on! it cannot injure now! [Throws himself on the couch. Charlotte (looking sometimes at him and flying to him.) O, Werter! Why will you plunge in misery again? Why will you leave the shelter of your friends For this distracted scene? Werter. Charlotte, I came To you alone! one gentle hour of love, Snatched at a time so circumstanc'd as this, Is better than an age of other life! Charlotte. Werter, no moreâthis is no time for loveâ O let the torturer for ever sleep In silent peace! for should he wake again, 'Tis but to lead us to the brink of horror! Once more I charge thee to subdue a passion So vainly, madly form'd! a passion joined To sure destruction!âwhy is it only me? Me, that's another's?âalas! I much, much fear The conscious thoughtâI can be never thine Only encreases the enraged desire! Werter. Did Albert furnish thee with this reflection? 'Tis a profound one. Charlotte. Nay, think me not severe! By heaven, e'en now my struggling heart recoils While thus it chides! and could the trembler speak, 'Twould tell thee that it pants to sooth and share Each pang that tortures thineâbut as the cause Of all thy sorrows; it should seem not harsh That pity prompts me to invent a cure! Werter. And know'st thou of a cure? Charlotte. Return to Manheimâ Time may do muchâabsence, perhaps much more; Another object too may change the sceneâ One who deserves thy love, who'll hear thy tale, And by dividing, dissipate thy woes: And when past sorrows shall be quite forgot, Bring her to Walheim, and with us enjoy The purest pleasures perfect friendship yields. Werter. All will be well e'er longâall will be well! Charlotte. Do not oppose my wishâfor well you know Albert has been most kindâhis generous love Merits returnâand I could rather die Than willingly torment him with a care! Therefore, alas! I tremble as I speak! We meet with prudence, or we meet no more! [Here they both rise. Werter. 'Tis wellâ'tis very well! Charlotte. Honour incites The fix'd resolve!âheavens! relieve me now! I scarce have power to speakâha! thou art pale! Werter. Or meet no more! Charlotte. Why knawest thou so thy lip? Werter. Or meet no more! Charlotte. What wild mysterious words! Some smother'd passion struggles in thy breast. Speakâ Werter. I dare not. Charlotte. O speak, in mercy speak. 'Tis death to see thee thus! Werter. Death! Charlotte. Ay, Werter, death! Werter. Deathâha! did'st thou say death!âLo! where he stalks! See how he shakes his bloody spear at me! Hence, thou pale warrior, hence! Thou can'st not hurt! [Takes Charlotte by the hand. You shall not, cannot part us! Alas! where am I?âAh, my brain is turned! Pity me, Charlotte, pity me! I am The veriest wretch alive! Charlotte. Alas! my Werter. Werter. Oh! forgive me; the raging tumult's o'er And I'm again myselfâ'twas but a fancy Of my too-troubl'd mindâThink on't no more Some better subject may employ our thoughts. Oft have we chac'd the heavy hour away In reading OpianâMay we not read again?â Charlotte. Here is your own translation of his songs. [Here they seat themselves. Werter. O! Charlotte, what ravages hard time has made Since last I read themâOf that no moreâ Alas! the leaf's turn'd down Where hopeless Armin mourns his murder'd child! Werter reads. âAlone on the sea-beat rock my daughter was heard to complainâfrequent and loud were her cries, nor could her Father relieve her. All night I stood on the shoreâI saw her by the faint beam of the Moon, and before morning appear'd her voice was weakâIt died away, like the evening breeze amongst the grass of the rocksâspent with grief she expir'd and left thee, Arminâalone!â [Here Werter throws down the book, seizes Charlotte's. hand and weeps over itâshe leans on her other arm, holding her handkerchief to her eyesâthey are both in the utmost agitationâIn this unhappy story they feel their own misfortunes.âAt length Charlotte says, âGo on.â Werter reads. âWhy dost thou awake me, O! gale!âIt seems to say I am cover'd with the drops of Heavenâ The time of my fadingâis near, and the blastâ that shall scatter my leavesâto-morrowâshall the traveller comeâHe that saw me in my beauty âshall comeâHis eyes shall search the field âButâthey will notâfind me!â [These words fall like a stroke of thunder on the heart of the unfortunate Werter! In despair he throws himself at her feet, seizes her hand and puts it to his forehead. An apprehension of his fatal project, for the first time, struck Charlotteâshe is distracted. Charlotte , starting from the couch. Heavens! Suicideâam I to be so curst? Is there no mercy to be found in Heaven? Is virtue ever to be tortur'd thus?â O Werter! Werter! [Falling on him. Werter. I will not lose theeâ Thus let me ever clasp thee to my heart. [Here they lose sight of every thing, and the whole world disappears before them.âHe clasps her in his arms and strains her to his bosom. Charlotte. Werter! (with a faint voice) Werter! (gently pushing him away) Werter! (with the firm voice of virtue) This is the last time!âwe neverâneverâmeet again!â [Exit. Werter , solus. Now art thou satisfied indignant fate! Is not thy vengeance glutted now?âThen look And sate thy soul with triumph and revenge, For I am curst beyond the reach of Hope! Heavens! how the tempest rages in my brain! 'Tis all on fire!âO! Charlotte, Charlotte, Once more come forth and soften me to calmness. [Throws himself on the couch. Enter ALBERT. Albert. The night and ceasless fury of the storm Compell'd me to returnâstrange fancies too Perplex my mind and agitate me much. I know not what to thinkâHow! Werter here! This is most strange!âBut Albert have a care, Suspect not without cause, for when thou dost, Then art thou damn'd indeed!âOf all calamities Suspicion I have yet avoid'd mostâ And ever will!âWelcome again to Walheim. Werter , not looking up. Awayâawayâand leave me to my Sorrows. Albert. Still on affliction WerterâI hop'd e'er this Thy friends had chac'd each dismal care away, And quite restor'd thee to thy former peace. O 'tis a weakness to be ever thus! Look up my friendâ'tis Albert speaksâ Werter. Albert! The last on earth I would intrude on thus: Oh! Albert, do I merit this from thee? Am I not most unworthy of thy friendship? Albert. Unworthy!ânow by you, Heaven, I swear, There's not an action (unallied to sin) However dangerous, however painful, But I would willingly attempt for Werter! Werter (taking Albert by the hand.) Then, Albert, hear!âand O! ye powers above! That ever blast the wishes of my soul, For once be merciful, and grant my prayer! Let anguish, sorrow, and despair combine, To form in unison one perfect wretch! And let that wretch be Werter!âbut gracious heaven! Let all the curses that are lavish'd here, Be doubl'd in thy mercies blessings there. Let purest pleasure, let perpetual peace, Eternal happiness, and constant love, Attend him even to the hour of fate! But long avert that hour!âHe deserves it allâ I can no moreâmy spirits weaken fastâ I prithee bear me hence.â Albert. Bear on my arm. A little quiet will restore thy strengthâ Thou shalt rest here to-night. Werter. I thank thee muchâ But I have business that compels me hence: Yes; I have that which cannot be postpon'd! Albert. Nay, sigh not Werterâyou will be soon at peace. Werter. Yes, Albert! very soon!âI would be goneâ Albert. I will conduct thee. Werter. How can I ever make thee a return! Albert. Nay, say no moreâbear up my friendâbear upâ Time will restore you to your wonted peace. [Exeunt, END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCENE ALBERT's Apartment. Enter SEBASTIAN and SERVANT. Sebastian. Have you inform'd your Lady, Sebastian waits her leisure? Servant. I have, Sir, Exit. Sebastian. O may she grant the favour I entreat, And with attractions that might captivate A heart less weak, less ardent, than my Friend's! Enter CHARLOTTE. Your pardon, lady, that I thus intrudeâ I come deputed by a wretched friend, To tell you, he repents his follies past, And will offend no moreâ'Tis his interest To leave this place to-nightâYet e'er he goes, He could have wish'd for one parting look, One short farewell, to cheer him on his wayâ And if my wishes will not lessen his, I add them from my soul. Charlotte. Oh Sir! your friend Has but deceiv'd you with this flattering tale. A secret passion struggles in his breast, Which when reveal'd.â Sebastian. A secret passion! Charlotte. Alas! I fear He has resolv'd upon a fatal act, Which you, Sebastian, only can prevent. Sebastian. Heavens! what act? Charlotte. Suicide! Sebastian. It cannot beâ He is too great to stoop to such a thought. Charlotte. Too well I know itâE'er we parted last, In a fond moment he betray'd his purpose; And I unable to support the conflict, Left him, I fear, determin'd on the deedâ Fly, Sir, this instant, and avert the blow. Why dost thou hesitate? Sebastian. If it be true, I scorn him from my soul. Charlotte. O do not pause! be swifter than the wind, Or he will fall for ever. Sebastian. When virtue's dead, he is not fit to live; Had one good sentiment inspir'd his breast, It wou'd have prompted him to cherish life. Has it no object then!âdoes he not owe Distress his succour, penury his aid, Grief his assistance, merit his support! Has heaven, his country, and his friends no claim? Oh! by my soul, he merits instant death: That he may feel the agonies that wait On guilt so great as his! Charlotte. Deluded man! You paint the various vices of your friend With all the terrors that attend on death; And yet would let him fall, when but a word From thee, Sebastian, might protect him still; The guilt is thine then, for by thee he dies: And well remember, sir, when fortune smil'd, You were the pilot of his prosperous bark; But at a moment, when a tempest rose, And dangers thicken'd round, you shun'd your post, And, like a coward, left him to the storm. Sebastian. No more, no more, In the wild transport of a heart too warm, I had forgot my friendâlet me begone! And yet protect him from the desperate act. Charlotte. Yet hold, compassion prompts me to return him thisâ If he relents, And turns with horror from this act, I once will see him more. Sebastian. Generous offer! This, this alone, will make him shrink from death: Methinks he stands on danger's naked cliff, And tottering ponders on the gulph below; From that I'll snatch him, fold him in my arms, And waft him to the blessed shores of peace. [Exit. Charlotte solus. O what a fate is mine!âa generous lover, E'er now resolving on a sudden death, And I his murderer! a faithful husband, Who long has lov'd, long watched my cruel heart, Offend'd and incens'd!âah! there's the rock On which my shatter'd vessel will be crush'd: Reproof from Albert will afflict me more Than all my sorrows past. Enter ALBERT. Albert. The more I think, the more I am perplex'dâ E'en now I met Sebastian at the portal, And Werter left her not an hour ago: Can she be false!âcan heaven's own image! Can Charlotte?âbut ah! I reason as I wishâ Wou'd she were true! and memory cou'd forget The various follies that my fondness lavish'dâ Oh! I deserve the torments I endure. Charlotte. Ha! so disturb'dâthen are my fears confirm'd: I hope, my lord, no sudden accident Delay'd your journey. Albert. I crave your pardon, Charlotte; It is impossible! that angel form Wou'd blush at frailtyâbut be it as it may, I still adore, and still confess her power. O my dear partner! Charlotte. In tears, my lord: What can this mean! Albert. Have I no cause to weep? Charlotte. I know of none. Albert. Of none! my Charlotte. Charlotte. No; on my soulâif innocenceâ Albert. Innocence! Charlotte. Oh! on my knees let me intreat thee, Albert, Unfold this mystery!âlet not my mind Be tortured with suspenceâspeak! quickly speak, Or sudden madness will distract my brain. Albert. Nay, do not kneelâI prithee leave me nowâ My mind is much disturb'd.â Charlotte. No! kill me quite. Let me not linger in my painâoh, Albert! Thus, thus I'll cling, thus grovel at thy feet, 'Till thou hast freed my doubts!âIf I'm the cause Thy fears are falseâoh, by mine honour, false! Albert. Honour! Charlotte. Ha! you mock me still. Albert. Yet, leave me: A new unusual fury rages here, And soon 'twill blaze abroadâawayâ Charlotte. 'Tis well. Albert mistrusts his Charlotteâyes, high heaven! He doubts her honour, he suspects her love: Oh hear! and answer if she merits this! Albert (laying hold of her.) Werter. Charlotte (much confused.) Ha! what of him? Albert. O, Guilt! Guilt! Charlotte. Guilt! Albert. Yes, guilt! Hast thou not art enough to hide thy shame? But thus must boast it! thus to the very face Of him thou hast abus'd. Charlotte. If it be guilt to suffer keen reproach, Regret, affliction, terror, and despair, With every torture that can rack the soul! Rather than wander from my truth to thee, In action, word or thoughtâif this be guilt! I own, my lord, the justice of your charge, And well deserves the phrase. Albert. This syren's song No more shall captivate my pliant soul; I've been too long amus'd, too long deceiv'd; My love has been long abus'd, my liberal conduct Scorn'd and derid'dâbut thou shalt know I'm not that dupe, that easy placid fool Thy falshood wish'd! no; I'll exert my powers, Enforce my rights, and be a tyrant too: Yes; mark me, madam, I charge thee on thy truth, Nay, on thy peril, never to be seen Or found in converse with thy minion more. Charlotte. Minion! must I bear this? Albert. Ay, and more, much more. Charlotte. No, Albert, a little while ago You found me fond, affectionate, and weak, Made up of folly, levity and fears; But your own rashness has restor'd my sense, And I despise your threatsâminion! O shame! Use such another word, and here I vow, If e'er I deign to listen to you more, 'Tis but with scornâunalterable scorn. Albert. This poor pretended spirit is in vain, Thy stubborn heart shall bleed. Charlotte. You little know The heart of Charlotte, if you think 'twill bleed At follies idle raceâno, my lord, When you return to your accustom'd peace, And converse like yourself I am your own; Proud to indulge, and happy to obey you; But when you lose that calmness you profess, And thus insult me, I am only taught That Albert is no better than a tyrant, Whose vain presumption merits my disdain. Albert. Away, awayâI'll trifle time no more; Now, hear my last resolve:âby heaven I love thee More than romantic fancy can express, And wou'd not leave thee for eternal peace; But if you still persist To let another triumph in your heart, Thou art no longer mineâwe part for ever! Charlotte. Ungenerous man! Is it for this my soul resign'd its love, And kept its vow to thee! Is it for this He you abuse in endless anguish lives, PerhapsâI cannot speakâ(weeps.) Albert. Ha! dost thou weep! perfidious woman, go, Go to thy Werter, revel in his arms, Albert will never interrupt you more, [Exit. Charlotte. When, angry heaven, shall thy vengeance cease! When shall this little victim be allow'd A momentary calmânever, neverâ Yet somethingâmyself shall save him from The horrid deed. Enter WERTER (supported by Leuthrop.) Werter. A little onward bear me, faithful Leuthrop, To sigh my life out at my Charlotte's feet, And I shall die content. Charlotte. O heavens, was Sebastianâ Werter. He was deceiv'dâI yielded to his wish, And while he left me to prepare for Manheim, Compleated my designâit was my fate To catch a sad distemper in the heart, Which grew contagious, and while it canker'd here Infected all who sooth'dâcould I then live But to destroy the sharers of my pains! Charlotte. Haste to Sebastian, tell him allâawayâ Some speedy antidote may yet be found: He cannot, shall not die. Werter. Give me some comfort, For I am coward allâI fear'd to brave Life's common chances, and I shudder now To meet that death I soughtâhorror! horror! I dare not think upon the deed I've done; I have invaded nature's sacred law, Rebell'd against heaven itself!âO my Charlotte! Is there no hope of pardon? Charlotte. Cruel, cruel hour! And must I lose thee, Werter! Werter. Tell Albert to forgive me, For I have injur'd and abus'd him much: Forgive me too thyself!âcould I but live! It will not beâha! that pang was death'sâ It will not beâmercy, mercy, heaven! Dies. (Charlotte falls on the body.) Enter ALBERT, SEBASTIAN, and LEUTHROP. Sebastian. The sharpest torments cruelty suggests, Wou'd be indulgence to the pangs I feel: Who but Sebastian wou'd have left his friend! Had I remain'd and sooth'd him as I ought, This ne'er had happen'dâcurst! curst reflection! I am the fatal cause of all these sorrows. Albert (Weeping over Charlotte,) No, 'tis from Albert every sorrow flows. Had I not been the weakest, worst of men, I had resign'd my Charlotte! and been happy In seeing her so exquisitely blest. What am I now! thou injur'd innocence! Pronounce my doom! Charlotte. (Starting up.) Talk not to meâaway! Be swift as light'ning, or you'll be too late: He's in your fatal vale!âI left him there, His sword was drawn, and death sat brooding by; Fly or he's murder'd!âHark! a shriekâa shriek!â Ah! now! 'tis past, the sweet deluder's vanish'd, And I must wander o'er the world alone. Sebastian. (To Charlotte.) Let not excess of grief O'ercome thy reason, but with pity look On wretched Albert. Charlotte. Albert! I know him well, He is my husband, guardian of my honour! Honour! no more of thatâno more of thatâ That kill'd the innocent!âOh my poor heart! Albert. Hold, Hold my brain!âwill none attempt to sooth her! Will none assist! I can no longer bear The madening sight! (Falls on Leuthrop.) Charlotte. Thereâthere's his sepulchreâ Ha! see it shakesâThe tomb is all convuls'd! Softânow it yawns, and gently steals apartâ 'Tis burst asunder!âHere the body lies! Alas! how chang'd! These tears, neglect'd shade, Shall wash thy rankling woundsâThese handsâAh! look, His eye-balls roll! he tremble's in his shroudâ He is alive! and all will still be well. See! see! to heaven he mounts; Legions of angels hover round his form, He beckons me! Werter, I come! I comeâ And now let honour part us if it can! Sebastian. Oh Albert! Lose not thy firmness at this awful moment; The storm shall soon be o'er, and all be calmâ Alas! he speaks notâexcess of sorrow, Has quite subdued himâLeuthrop, bear him in, And ease him of these tortures, if you canâ Albert has merited a better fate.â From these disasters, we are taught to shun The sad temptations of unlawful love. For oh! shou'd passion conquer reason's power, (And reason oft in weak) the desperate mind May turn to death for peaceâDestructive hope! For if one crime is blacker than the rest, Below more punish'd, more abhor'd above; 'Tis self destruction; 'tis by heaven decreed, So high an outrage! that at mercy's throne, The suicide alone is shut from Grace.
