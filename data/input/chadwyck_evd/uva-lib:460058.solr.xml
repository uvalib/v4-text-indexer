      <field name="fulltext">AGAMEMNON. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE Princess of Wales.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. By the Author of Eurydice. Spoken by Mr. Quin. When this decisive Night, at length, appears, The Night of every Author's Hopes and Fears; What Shifts, to bribe Applause, poor Poets try? In all the Forms of Wit they court and lye: These meanly beg it, as an Alms; and Those, By boastful Bluster, dazzle and impose. Nor poorly fearful, nor securely vain; Ours would, by honest Ways, that Grace obtain: Would, as a Free-born Wit, be fairly try'd: And thenâlet Truth and Candour, fair, decide. He courts no Friend, who blindly comes to praise; He dreads no Foeâbut whom his Faults may raise. Indulge a generous Pride, that bids him own, He aims to please, by noble Means, alone: By what may win the Judgment, wake the Heart, Inspiring Nature, and directing Art: By Scenes, so wrought, so rais'd, as may command Applause, more from the Head, than from the Hand. Important is the Moral we wou'd teach: (Oh may this Island practise what we preach!) Vice, in its first Approach, with Care to shun; The Wretch, who once engages, is undone. Crimes lead to greater Crimes, and link so streight, What first was Accident, at last is Fate: Th'unhappy Servant sinks into a Slave; And Virtue's last sad Strugglings cannot save. âAs such our fair Attempt, we hope to see âOur Judges,âhere at least,âfrom Influence free; âOne Place,âunbiass'd yet by Party-Rage,â âWhere only Honour votes,âthe British Stage. âWe ask for Justice, for Indulgence sue: âOur last best Licence must proceed from you.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Clytemnestra sitting in a disconsolate Posture, and her Attendant. Attendant. O Clytemnestra! O my royal Mistress! Can then no Comfort sooth your Woes a while? E'er since that flaming Signal of sackt Troy, That Signal fix'd and promis'd by the King, Was seen some Nights ago, nor Food has pass'd Your loathing Lips, nor Sleep has bless'd your Eyes. Or if, perhaps, a transient Slumber hush'd Your Sighs a moment, and restrain'd your Tears; Sudden, you, starting wildly, would exclaim Of Guilt, Egisthus, Troy and Agamemnon. Sure, 'tis too much, my Queen. Clytemnestra. Away! away! Since my lost State admits of no Relief, To that sad Comfort of the Wretched leave me, To yield me to my Sorrows. Attendant. Hear me, Madam, Once the dear Burden of these aged Arms! My tender Care from Life's first opening Bud! My Joy! my Glory! hear your faithful Servant, And let me add your Friend.âIn Reason's Eye, That never judges on a partial View, Far less than your Misfortune is your Guilt.â Your GuiltâForgive me, 'tis too harsh a Word, For what deserves Compassion more than Blame. I know the treacherous ways by which you sunk, From pleasing Peace, to these unhappy Fears, This anxious Tumult.â Clytemnestra. Hide me from the View! All Comfort is in vain.âAway! Attendant. Allow me, To plead your injur'd Cause against yourself. When Agamemnon led the Greeks to Troy, And left you, Madam, for the Pomp of War; Left you the Pride of Greece, in full-blown Beauty, The kindest Mother, and the fondest Wife; If Fame says true, for Trojan Captives left youâ But that apart.âHow did he leave you, say? Afflicted, outrag'd, as a Queen and Mother, Betray'd to Aulis with your first-born Hope, The blooming Iphigenia, under Feint Of her immediate Marriage to Achilles; And there no sooner at the wind-bound Fleet Arriv'd, but you beheld her spotless Blood Stream on the sully'd Altar of Diana, The Price of Winds, of a dear-purchas'd Gale, To bear them on to Troy. Thus pierc'd with Grief, Then fir'd by turns to Rage, almost to Vengeance, At an ambitious cruel haughty Husband; While all your Passions were together mix'd, And ready for a Change; was you not left In a submissive soothing Lover's power, Ordain'd your Partner in the sovereign Rule O'er Argos and MycenÃ¦, but to you As pliant still as Agamemnon stately? Clytemnestra , rising. Alas! too true! You touch the Source of Woe. Why did you leave me, barbarous Agamemnon? Why leave me weeping o'er a murder'd Daughter? Why helpless leave me to a troubled Mind? Ah! why yourself betray me to a Lover? What Arts Egisthus us'd too well I know; All that can softly steal, or gayly charm, The Heart of WomanâHence, dear sad Ideas! Destroyers hence! And dare you tempt me still, Perfidious Syrens! in that very moment When your false Charms have wreckt my Peace for ever? Oh, Nature! wherefore, Nature, are we form'd One Contradiction? the continual Sport Of fighting Powers? Oh! wherefore hast thou sown Such War within us, such unequal Conflict, Between slow Reason and impetuous Passion? Passion resistless hurries us away, Ere lingering Reason to our Aid can come, And to upbraid us then it only serves. Tormentor, cease! Attendant. You wrong yourself too much. Think, Madam, how for Years you baffled Love: Nor could Egisthus, tho' he touch'd your Heart, Tho' many a midnight Tear, and secret Sigh, To me, and me alone, disclos'd the Pangs, That dim'd your fading Cheek; yet could he not, With all his Arts, his Love, Submission, Charms, O'ercome the struggling Purpose of your Soul; Till Melisander, to a desart Isle, He banish'd from your Ear. Clytemnestra. Ah Melisander! Given to the Beasts a Prey, or wilder Famine; Ah perish'd Friend! serene directing Light, By Agamemnon left to guide my Councils; Whom every Science every Muse adorn'd, While the good honest Heart enrich'd them all; Oh hadst thou still remain'd, then I, this Day, Had been as glorious as I now am wretched! There breathes a felt Divinity in Virtue, In candid unassuming generous Virtue, Whose very Silence speaks; and which inspires, Without proud formal Lessons, a Disdain Of mean injurious Vice. But lost with him, With Melisander, Reason, Honour, Pride, Truth, sound Advice, my better Genius fled; I friendless, flatter'd, importun'd and charm'd Was left alone with all-seducing Love; Love to the Future blind, each sober Thought Each Consequence despising, scorning all, Save what it's own enchanting Dreams suggest. What could I do?âAway! Self-flattering Guilt! I should have thought, when Honour once is sully'd, Not weeping Mercy's Tears can wash it clean; And that one Blot on mine diffus'd a Stain O'er the proud Honour of a wedded King, And o'er my Children's, my poor blameless Children's! Whose Cheeks will kindle at their Mother's Name! I should have thoughtâWould I could think no more! To think is Torture! Attendant. What avails it, Madamâ Clytemnestra. O Melisander! If the Dead could hear, I would invoke thy friendly Influence now, Would wish thee present in this Hour of Trouble. Perhaps there is in Wisdom, gentle Wisdom, That knows our Frailties, therefore can forgive, Some healing Comfort for a guilty Mind, Some Power to charm it into Peace again, And bid it smile anew with right Affections. No! fruitless Wish!âIt cannot, cannot be! Egisthus, who may henceforth give me Laws, Dread of Discovery, that worst Tyrant, Shame, And my own conscious blotted Heart forbid it, Forbid Retreatâ Attendant. Madam, behold the Man, Who, then upon the Watch, observ'd the Signal Of conquer'd Troy, and now attends your Orders To give a full Account of what he saw. SCENE II. Clytemnestra, her Attendant, and the Man who observed the Signal. Clytemnestra. Are you then sure that you beheld this Signal? Or was it not some Vision of the Brain, That painted, while you slept, your waking Wish? Or else perhaps some Meteor of the Night? Man. Madam, Troy doubtless lies one Heap of Ruins; I saw the Signal of it's Fate distinctly. The Night was dark and still. A heavier Gloom Ne'er cover'd Earth. In low'ring Clouds, the Stars Were muffled deep; and not one Ray, below, O'er all MycenÃ¦ glimmer'd, or around it. When strait, at farthest East, a ruddy Light Sprung up, and, wide-encreasing, roll'd along; By turns diminish'd, and by turns renew'd, A Wave of Fire: at last, it flam'd confess'd, From Isle to Isle, and beachy Point to Point; Till the last Blaze at Nauplia ended, plain. A glorious Sight! and as a Greek rejoic'd me. Clytemnestra. How sits the Wind? Man. It blows from Troy, direct; A bold and steady Gale. Clytemnestra. 'Tis well. Retire. Your Care and faithful Pains shall be rewarded. SCENE III. Clytemnestra, her Attendant. Clytemnestra. He comes! he comes! the hapless Victor comes! Even now his trophy'd Vessel streaks the Main, And ploughs the Billows with triumphant Prow; Or, by glad Crouds receiv'd, perhaps, he hails His native Shore, and presses on to Shame. Even now with Glory charg'd, with Conquest gay, Crown'd with the Laurels of ten famous Years, He dreams to join them to the peaceful Olive; And, after rugged Toils and perillous War, Soft to repose him on the Myrtle Bed Of calm domestic Bliss. How vain the Hopes! How short the Prospect of believing Man! I dare not look before me, dare not paint The rising Storm. Attendant. Behold Egisthus, Madam. Clytemnestra. Leave me. SCENE IV. Clytemnestra, Egisthus. Egisthus , after some Silence. And is it thus, O Clytemnestra, Thus that, in Hours of Danger, Lovers meet? [pausing. Still coldly silent, still the Look averted, Where not one Softness glows? While Anger, Fear, Disgust and sick Repentance, shifting, cloud Your vary'd Cheek. 'Tis plain, you never lov'd. Clytemnestra. Oh that I never had! Egisthus. You never did. The very Power to wish it proves you did not. Clytemnestra. He ne'er deserv'd my Love, who dares suspect it. Egisthus. Not to suspect it Weakness were and Folly. Clytemnestra. Nor only doubt; believe your Doubts. Egisthus. I do. Clytemnestra. You do! Egisthus. Nay more, am of their Truth assur'd. Clytemnestra. 'Tis base, ungrateful, an ungenerous Insult, To tell me this. Urge not too far, Egisthus, Urge not too far my guilt-dejected Spirit. Tho' you have trampl'd on my haughty Virtue, That noble Pride of Soul, which knows no Fear, And bears no Insult; yet to you, at least, To you of all Mankind, I will be bold, As I had never err'd, will be a Queen, The Blood of Jove, be Clytemnestra still. Egisthus. Be temperate, Madam: I have told you nothing, But that I am not worthy of your Love. Clytemnestra. Curse on that Pride! which, with affected Brow, Humility conceals. And am I then so vile, So lost to Reason, Honour, common Honour; As without Love, that all-compelling Fury, Without debasing, thoughtless, blind blind Love; To bow me from the Height of happy Life, To this low fearful State of coward Shame? Mistake me notâI would not waste one Word, One passing Word, affronted thus, to save you From Jealousy's worst Rage; did not, alas! A kind of mournful Justice to my self Tear from my swelling Heart the mean Confession. How art thou fallen! to what Dishonour fallen! Unhappy Clytemnestra! Egisthus. Harsh Construction! And yet these Frowns delight, that Anger charms me. O more than lovely! O majestic Fair-one! Since you then know the jealous Force of Love, Forgive its tender Fears, its fond Offence; Offence I could not mean. Clytemnestra. Ill-fated she! Who must forgive. Egisthus. Nay rather cast me from you, Than thus upbraid me with so forc'd a Pardon. O Clytemnestra! where are now those Looks, Those Looks of smiling Heaven, of radiant Sweetness, That wak'd our Morn of Love? Within whose Sphere, No Evil durst approach, no Sadness dwell; While the charm'd Gazer knew nor Fear nor Danger? And set they then at last in gloomy Quarrels? Let us not quarrel. Why should Lovers quarrel? Life is for that too short, too precious Time; These Moments chiefly, these impetuous Moments, That to the Brink of Ruin seem to roll Our mingled Fate. Even nowâ Clytemnestra. 'Tis true! 'Tis true! Alas! methinks, in every hollow Blast, That shakes this Palace, Agamemnon comes. Yes, yes, Egisthus, still a Proof remains, A matchless Proof of Love, I mean to give you. Glad will I throw this regal Pomp aside, And, instant, with you seek some distant Country, Some gloomy Thracian Dale, where piny Hemus May wrap us in impenetrable Shade: There, there, the coarsest Life, fed by hard Toil, Will be luxurious Ease to what I feel, To this big Pang that labours at my Heart, And fires my mingling Passions into Anguish. Quick! let us fly, Egisthus, fly this Moment! The next may seize us, bind us down to Shame, Detested Shame! Egisthus. What! Clytemnestra! fly! That is indeed the Road direct to Shame, To Infamy for ever. He who flies, In War or Peace, who his great Purpose yields, He is the only Villain of this World: But he, who labours firm and gains his Point, Be what it will; who crowns him with Success; He is the Son of Fortune and of Fame, By those admir'd, those specious Villains most, That else had bellow'd out Reproach against him. Besides your Husband, your vain-glorious Husband, Proud Agamemnon, who ten years has warr'd At Troy, to scourge your Sister Helen's Rape, Dream you that he would not pursue our Flight, Tho' we took shelter in Cimmerian Shades, And drag us back, the Scorn of hissing Greece, To then deserv'd, to true unpity'd Shame. Clytemnestra. Excuse my weaker Heart. But how, Egisthus, How shall I bear an injur'd Husband's Eye? The fiercest Foe wears not a Look so dreadful, As does the Man we wrong. Egisthus. Madam, your Fears Cast a false Glare upon your troubled Reason, That blinds it quite.âAn injur'd Husband he! He wrong'd! No, Clytemnestra never, never, Can never wrong her Tyrant Agamemnon, Tyrant of common Greece; can never wrong The Man who leaves her ten regardless Years, For the vain Honours of a foolish War; Nay, who consum'd those Years, if Fame speaks true, In nothing less than War: instead of War, In shameful Squabbles with his nobler Friends, About their Captive Females, training out, An amorous Revel rather than a War, Far from his Country, Family and Queen. And can you wrong this False-one? Think of Aulis, How basely to that Port you was betray'd, And what dire Nuptials waited there your Daughter. Think with what Price he bought his cruel Trophies. Behold the first-born Blossom of your Youth, Your Iphigenia, her mild Eyes dejected, Her Cheek o'ercast with Fear, her Bosom bare, An helpless, harmless uncomplaining Victim, Stab'd by the murderous Calchas; whilst her Father, Her unrelenting Father, to protect The Sacrifice, stands by. Behold, she bleeds, Pours the rich Stream she drew from that fair Bosom, Falls like a drooping Flower untimely cut, And all to purchase for her Sire's Impatience, From some fell Demon that bely'd Diana, A rising Gale. The Gale begins to blow, The Pendants flutter; when away he goes, Gayly he goes; and leaves a wretched Mother, To weep her murder'd Child.âIf yet one Spark Of wonted Spirit burns in Clytemnestra, If she still lives to Justice and to Nature, These these are Wrongs, that call aloud for Vengeance; And there are Hands that boldlyâstart not, Madamâ That will with Pride avenge you. Clytemnestra. Ha! what Hands? What Vengeance, say? Touch not so wild a String; It wakes new Discord in my jarring Soul. To the just Gods, not us, pertaineth Vengeance. I cannot, will not, e'er consent toâGods! Where roves my Tongue?âYou did not mention that, You did not mean it sureâOh spare, Egisthus, In pity spare my last Remains of Virtue! Oh make me not beyond Recovery vile! A Horror to myself!âHow wretched they, Who feel, yet cannot save, their dying Virtue! [A Shout heard. What means this Transport of the madning People? Oh my presaging Heart!âSave me!âAgain! Ah! little think they how their Joy distracts me! Egisthus. Some move this wayâResume your Temper, Madam. SCENE V. To Clytemnestra an Officer belonging to the Court. Officer. Madam, the King is near, from Nauplia comes; But such rejoicing Crouds around him throng, As makes his Journey slow. Just now arriv'd, Talthybius brings the News, and craves Admittance. Clytemnestra. Conduct him hither. SCENE VI. Clytemnestra , alone. Oh too faithful Signal! Now must I take another Step in Vice. Down, stubborn Heart! and learn Dissimulation: Yes learn to smile, tho' Sorrow wrap thee round; Learn to be Friends with Baseness.âSee! how gay This Herald strides along! Mistaken Man! SCENE VII. Clytemnestra, Talthybius, with some Grecian Soldiers that attend him. Clytemnestra. Welcome, Talthybius; welcome, ye brave Greeks. How fares the King? Talthybius. Madam, the King is well; Health Happiness and Glory join to crown him. His Heart, impatient to confer with yours, Sends me before him with its warmest Wishes, Its warmest Gratulations. Tell, he said, âGo tell my Clytemnestra, that the Thoughts âOf meeting her awake a dearer Joy âThan Conquest ever gave: even tedious seems âMy People's Love, that loses me a Moment. This Crown which circled once the Royal Brows Of Hecuba, of Priam's lofty Queen, He prays you to accept. Clytemnestra. There, set it down. I own, Talthybius, the soft Moisture fills My Woman's Eyes, while on the sudden Turns Of Fate I think, on Fortune's sad Reverses. Oft when blind Mortals think themselves secure, In height of Bliss, they touch the Brink of Ruin. But sure your Voyage has been wond'rous quick, Not three full Days:âIs all the Fleet return'd? Talthybius. No, Madam; none, except this single Ship, Which bore the King: the rest are scatter'd wide. When to the joyous Breeze we spread our Sails, And left that Bay, where Simois and Scamander Mix with the rapid Hellespont; while Troy, Or what was Troy, yet wreathing Smoak to Heaven, And Ida's woody Top, receding, sunk Beneath the trembling Main: the Sky was fair; And, wing'd our Course with slender Airs, we sail'd, Till Night, in goodly Company, along. But strait, as Evening fell, the fluttering Gale, Encreasing gradual, from the red North-East, Blew stiff and fierce. At last the Tempest howl'd. Next Morning, nought but angry Seas and Skies Appear'd, conflicting, round. Mean time, right on, Our strong-ribb'd Vessel drove before the Blast, That, falling somewhat of its Fury, gave us A quick auspicious Voyage. Safe, we pass'd The Cyclade Isles, that, o'er the troubled Deep, Seem'd then to float amidst the mingling Storm. Only at one, with much ado, we touch'd, Nor without risque. Clytemnestra. And why? Talthybius. Madam, compell'd By sacred Pity. On the foaming Beach, A miserable Figure beck'ning stood, Horrid and wild, with Famine worn away. His plaintive Voice, half by the murmuring Surge Absorpt, just reach'd our Ears. In Greek he call'd, And strong adjur'd us by the gentle Gods, That make the Wretched their peculiar Care, To bear him thence, from savage Solitude, Into the chearful Haunts of Man again. Clytemnestra. What?âOf Condition look'd He? Talthybius. So he seem'd; Tho' dim'd by helpless solitary Life. The King regards him muchâForgive me, Madam; I see the rueful Image but disturbs Your generous Soul. Clytemnestra. I thank you, good Talthybius; And from the King himself will learn the rest. This Ring, on which a Victory is carv'd, With curious Art, befits the News you bring: I am your Debtor still; and, Soldiers, yours. End of the first ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Clytemnestra, Attendant. Clytemnestra. Arriv'd so soon!âI am not half prepar'd: My Features all are sunk with conscious Shame; My Eyes are yet too tender to dissemble. Attendant. Madam, be firm. Wipe off these gloomy Tears, In which too plain is read your troubled Soul. Just now the Trumpet spoke the King's Approach. Clytemnestra. 'Tis come, at last, the trying Hour is come! Oh that my Heart were hard, and Features false!â Again these Trumpets swellâ Attendant. A moment, Madam, A moment will betray you. Clytemnestra. Open, Earth, And swallow up my Shame!âWhat can I do? Where look? what say? Confusion! Torture! Attendant. Madamâ Clytemnestra. Ah, Coward that I am! Was there no Dagger, To save this ten-fold Death? Attendant. Hark! loud and near, The Triumph comes. Clytemnestra. Well.âgive me Breathâ [Endeavouring to compose her Agitation. Agamemnon , behind the Scenes. A Moment, Leave me, my Friends. Clytemnestra. Ha! heard you not his Voice? Yes, yes, 'tis he! Go, bring my Children hither: They may relieve me. Attendant. O remember!â Clytemnestra. Heavens! SCENE II. Agamemnon, Clytemnestra. Agamemnon. Where is my Life! my Love! my Clytemnestra! O let me press Thee to my fluttering Soul, That is on wing to mix itself with thine! O thou, for whom I live, for whom I conquer, Than Glory brighter! O my Clytemnestra! Now, in this dear Embrace, I lose the Toils Of ten Years War; Absence, with all its Pains, Is by this charming Moment wip'd away. All-bounteous Gods! Sure, never was a Heart So full, so blest as mine.â [discovering her Disorder. But whence, my Fairest! What mean these Tears?âNot Tears of happy Love, Such as I shed.âWhat means that clouded Look, Whose downcast Sweetness will not shine upon me? Why this cold Meeting? Why unkindly damp'd My Ardor thus? Oh speak, my Clytemnestra! Clytemnestra. Forgive me, Agamemnon; but I cannot, Alas! I cannot see your Face again, Without reflecting where I saw you last. Aulis is present to my Eyes anew, The Ships, the Chiefs, the Guards, the bloody Calchas, All the dire Pomp of Sacrifice around: Anew my Daughter bleeds, basely deceiv'd! And when I see that awful Brow, that doom'd Her, Need Agamemnon wonder at my Tears? Agamemnon. Why will my Clytemnestra add new Stings To what here rankles but too deep already? Ah! why impute to me the Work of Fate? 'Tis not indulging private Inclination, The selfish Passions, that sustains the World, And lends its Rulers Grace; no, 'tis not thence That Glory springs, and high immortal Deeds: The Public Good, the Good of others, still, Must bear fond Nature down, in him who dares Aspire to worthy Rule; imperious Honour Still o'er the most Distinguish'd lords it most. Was it for me?âLet even your Passions judgeâ For Agamemnon was it, when ordain'd, By common Voice, the General of the Greeks; While twenty Kings beneath my Banner march'd; And while around me full-assembled Greece, Indignant, kindled at your Sister's Rape, On her old native Foe demanding Vengeance, On faithless Asia: Was it then for me, To quench this glorious Flame? And to refuse One Life to Thousands, to those generous Thousands, That for my Honour, for the dearer Honour Of Clytemnestra's Family, stood all Prepar'd to die? If to the mingled Voice Of Honour, Duty, Glory, Public Good, Of the commanding Gods, I had been deaf; And, in the feeble Father, poorly sunk The Greek, the Chief, the Patriot and the King, Greater than King, the General of the Greeks; Then you yourself, my Clytemnestra's Self, Must (let her Heart avow the Truth) have scorn'd me. Nor think it was an easy Resignation. Oh Clytemnestra! Had you seen within, What here within my tortur'd Bosom pass'd; To that my Battles since were only Sport. No, not the kindest Mother, bath'd in Tears, As o'er her agonizing Babe she hangs, Feels what I suffer'd thenâYou may rememberâ Again the Father melts me at the Thoughtâ You may remember how I hid my Face; Asham'd to let the Greeks around behold The Tears, that misbecame their General's Cheek. Then cease to blame what rather merits Pity, I might add Praise.âHe, who the Father's Heart More tender has than mine, too tender has it. I love my Children, as a Father should; Besides, I love them from a softer Cause, I love my Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra. Had, alas! Had Agamemnon lov'd me, would He, nay, Could he have left me in the Rage of Grief, My Daughter yet fresh bleeding in my sight? Left me so long? Love surely must have found, In the wide Round of ten revolving Years, Some way to see me, to prevent these Sorrowsâ Why was I thus abandon'd, Agamemnon? Agamemnon. Let me kiss off these TearsâO beauteous Tears! If shed by doubting Love, if shed for Absence. Instead of these Reproaches, ask me rather, How I that Absence bore: and here all Words All Eloquence is dumb, to speak the Pangs, That lurk'd beneath the rugged Brow of War. When glaring Day was clos'd, and hush'd the Camp, Oh! then, amid ten thousand other Cares, Those stung the keenest that remember'd Thee, That on my long-left Clytemnestra thought, On what wild Seas and Mountains lay between us. Clytemnestra. Unhappy Man! Agamemnon. What says my Clytemnestra? Clytemnestra. Unhappy Mortals! by vain Words deceiv'd, To their own Pride, to joyless Honour Slaves. Agamemnon. He, he, alone, can claim a Right to Bliss, Who has fulfill'd the painful Task of Honour. Clytemnestra. But what avails a Right to vanish'd Bliss? Agamemnon. Let me once more adjure thee, Clytemnestra, By every tender Name of Love adjure Thee, To lose in kind Oblivion these our pastâ I would not call them QuarrelsâAh! there was, There was a TimeâI will indulge the Thoughtâ When everlasting Transport tun'd our Souls: When join'd to vernal Life, the Spring of Love Around us gayly blow'd; and Heaven and Earth, All smiling Nature look'd delighted on. Yet, would my Clytemnestra lend her Aid, I know a Passion still more deeply charming Than fever'd Youth e'er felt; and that is Love, By long Experience mellow'd into Friendship. How far beyond that froward Child of Fancy! With Beauty pleas'd awhile, anon disgusted, Seeking some other Toy; how nobler far Is this bright Offspring of unchanging Reason, That fonder grows with Age and Charms for ever! It is not often, Clytemnestra, thus, That I submit to double my Intreaties; But, oh destroy not the collected Hopes Of Life and Love! Oh make not Conquest hateful! I shall abhor it, if it cost me thee, Cost me thy Love, A Daughter was too much, And ten Years Absence from my Clytemnestra. Add not to these a Loss I cannot bear, The Loss of thee, thou loveliest of thy Sex! And once the kindest! Clytemnestra. Oh! Agamemnon. Turn not away; There is relenting Goodness in thy Look. Clytemnestra. Alas! untimely FondnessâAgamemnon! Too generous Agamemnon! you distress me. Would you were not so kind, so tender, now! Or ne'er had been so cruel! Agamemnon. 'Tis unjust To call me cruel. Fate, the Gods, our Fortune Were cruel to us bothâWhat could I more To sooth our parting Woes, and ease my Absence? I left you Melisander to advise you, Left you the wisest, faithfullest and bestâ Oh whisp'ring Nature! Are not these my Children? SCENE III. Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Electra, Orestes. Agamemnon. My Daughter! my Electra! Electra. O my Father! Agamemnon. Come to my Arms, my Boy! my dear Orestes! In whom I live anew, my younger Self! And thou, Electra, in thy opening Cheek I mark thy Mother's Bloom: even so she look'd, Such the mild Light with which her Beauty dawn'd. Oh thou soft Image of my Clytemnestra! My other Iphigenia! Electra. Oh my Father! My Joy! my Pride! my Glory! whom, in Dreams, I oft have seen, as if return'd from Troy; But still unwelcome Morning, with a Tear, Wip'd out the dear Illusion of the Night. And is it then no more a faithless Vision? Oh 'tis my Father! whose Departure hence, And Iphigenia's Death I just remember. How glorious, Iphigenia, was thy Death! A Death I envy rather than lament. Who would not die to gain immortal Fame, Deliver Greece and crown a Father's Glory? Agamemnon. Come to my Arms again, my generous Daughter! And Thou my Son! O that thy tender Years Had suffer'd thee to share our Toils at Troy! 'Tis War that forms the Prince: 'tis Hardship, Toil; 'Tis sleepless Nights, and never-resting Days; 'Tis Pain, 'tis Danger, 'tis affronted Death; 'Tis equal Fate for all, and changing Fortune; That rear the Mind to Glory, that inspire The noblest Virtues and the gentlest Manners. Where shall I find, to teach Thee these, Orestes, Another Troy? Orestes. How happy had I been! To have beheld what I must only hear. But I will hear it often, every Day; Will learn your Story, study your Example; Will try to mix your Virtues with your Blood, And not disgrace the Laurels I inherit. My Bosom flutters with I know not whatâ âForgive me, Sir, I am too young to say itâ But something here I feel, which bids me hope That I shall not betray my Father's Honour. Agamemnon. Son of my Soul!âLook here, my Clytemnestra! Look here and weep with Tenderness and Transport! What is all tasteless Luxury to this? To these best Joys, which holy Love bestows? O Nature! Parent Nature! Thou, alone, Art the best Judge of what can make us happy! Enter an Officer belonging to the Court. Officer. Egisthus, Sir, attends. Agamemnon. Go, bid him enter. Retire, my Clytemnestra, my dear Children: We soon shall meet again, till then farewel. SCENE IV. Agamemnon. Obey me, Features, for one supple Moment: You shall not long be tortur'd. Here, in Courts, We must not wear the Soldier's honest Face. He little thinks I have him in the Snare Of Melisander, whom, in my return, I from that desart Island chanc'd to save, To which the Ruffianâ SCENE V. Agamemnon, Egisthus. Egisthus. Health to Agamemnon! And Happiness responsive to his Glory! Agamemnon. Cousin, I greet you well. Egisthus. Forgive me, Sir, You have surpriz'd us with this quick Return: For by that Signal, whose illustrious Flame Rejoic'd all Greece, we did not hope your Presence These three days hence. Forgive, that, unprepar'd, We only with that Joy, that Transport, wonder, Which swell each Grecian Bosom, thus receive you. And truly such a Burst I have not seen Of that best Triumph. City, Country, all, Is in a gay triumphant Tempest tost. I scarce could press along. The Trumpet's Voice Is lost in loud repeated Shouts, that raise Your Name to Heaven. Ten thousand Eyes, below, Ake to behold the Conqueror of Troy. Agamemnon. The noblest Praise that can salute my Ear, The sweetest Music, is my People's Joy. But sure your Tongue has done it ample Justice; Trust me, you blazon a Description well. I have not heard so much obliging Speech These many Years. Egisthus. Misconstrue not my Zeal: On the full Heart obedient Language waits. I feel so deep your Glory, Agamemnon, As mingles with my Joy a sort of Passion, That almost touches Envy. O ye Gods! Has, while I liv'd, a War, the most renown'd Which any Age e'er saw, or shall again Be seen; a War, whose never-dying Fame Will cover Earth, and reach remotest Time, Has such a War adorn'd my Days, and I Not shar'd its Glory? Pining here, unknown, In nameless Peaceâhow have I lost my Life! Agamemnon. This Ardor is the Mode. But know, Egisthus, That ruling a free People well in Peace, Without or yielding or usurping Power; Maintaining firm the Honour of the Laws, Yet sometimes softening their too rigid Doom, As Mercy may require; steering the State, Thro' factious Storms, or the more dangerous Calms Of Peace, by long Continuance grown corrupt; Besides the fair Career which Fortune opens, To the mild Glories of protected Arts, To Bounty, to Beneficence, to Deeds That give the Gods themselves their brightest Beams: Yes, know, that these are, in true Glory, equal, If not superior, to deluding Conquest: Nor less demand they Conduct, Courage, Care, And persevering Toil. Egisthus. Say thankless Toil, Harsh and unpleasing; that, instead of Praise And due Reward, meets oftner Scorn, Reproach, Fierce Opposition to the clearest Measures; Injustice, Banishment, or Death itself: Such is the Nature of malignant Man. Not so the Victor's Meed: Him all approve, Him all admire. Agamemnon. Yet tho' a toilsome Task, Tho' an ungrateful Labour oft to rule; I not so hardly of Mankind, Egisthus, Presume to judge. Truth, Wisdom, Courage, Justice, Beneficence, and to the Public Good A constant Tenor of well laid Designs; These must be awful in the worst of Times, Be amiable, dear; while Worth, at last Will light up Worth, and Virtue kindle Virtue. You was however eas'd of half the Toil, By him I left to counsel Clytemnestra, By Melisander. Egisthus. Would to Heaven I had! Agamemnon. You much amaze me.âIs not Melisander Wise, just and faithful? Egisthus. Sir, I own He wore a specious Maskâ Agamemnon. Beware, Egisthus; I know his stedfast Worth, and will not bear The farthest Hint that stains the Man I love. Egisthus. Then urg'd by Truth, and in my own Defence, I boldly will assert him, Agamemnon, To be more apt to trouble and embroil, Than serve a State. A certain stubborn Virtue, I would say Affectation of blunt Virtue, Beneath whose outside Froth, fermenting, lay Pride, Envy, Faction, Turbulence of Soul, And Democratic Views, in some sort, made him A secret Traitor, equally unfit Or to obey or rule. But that I check'd His early Treasons, here, at your Return, You might have found your Kingdom a Republic. Agamemnon. O I shall lose all Patience!â [Aside. You do well, To give your Accusation open Speech. Meantime, remember, you must fully prove it, You must!âAnd he who Melisander proves The Wretch you have describ'd, proves Man is vain, And saps the broad Foundations of all Trust. I know he would not patiently look on, And suffer ill Designs to gather Strength, Awaiting gentle Seasons; yes, I know, He had a troublesome old-fashion'd way, Of shocking courtly Ears with horrid Truth. He was no civil Ruffian: none of those, Who lye with twisted Looks, betray with Shrugsâ I wax too warmâBut he was none of those, Is none of those dust-licking, reptile, close, Insinuating, speckled, smooth Court-Serpents, That make it so unsafe, chiefly for Kings, To walk this weedy WorldâPardon my Heatâ I wander from the PurposeâYou, Egisthus, Must prove your Charge, to Melisander's Face Must prove it. Egisthus. SurelyâSince the Princely Faith Of your own Blood you doubtâ Agamemnon. Friendship and Truth Are more a-kin to me than Blood. Egisthus. You shall, You shall have Proof; but to his Face you cannot. Agamemnon. But to his Face I will!âI cannot! why? Egisthus. He wanders far from hence, I know not where. For when I found him an undoubted Traitor, Tho' he the heaviest Punishment deserv'd, Yet in regard to that Esteem, which, once, You deign'd to bear him, Banishment alone Was all I did inflict. Agamemnon. I thank you, Sirâ O you are wond'rous good!âBut tell me, how, How durst you meddle in the Sphere assign'd To Clytemnestra? He was left to Her; To be her Counsellor I left my Friend, Left Melisander; left a Man, whom long, Whom well I knew; perhaps, to check you, left him: And you pretend, you!âBut I will be calmâ These Passions in a King to his Inferiors, Who cannot answer equal, are not comely. Forgive my TransportâA more quiet Hour Shall sift this Matter to the bottom, shall Do Melisander or Egisthus Justice. SCENE VI. Egisthus. Now go thy way, weak open-hearted Man, Thus to declare the Ruin thou intendest. Go, rate thy Trojan Slaves; and elsewhere practise This Insolence of Camps. Tame, as I seem, Submissive, mild, and patient of thy Threats, Yet, ere to-morrow's Sun beholds MycenÃ¦, My sure-aim'd Blow shall pierce thy swelling Heart, And cool this Tyrant's Fever in thy Veins. Were not our Blood our Kindred Blood at variance, And therefore burning with immortal Hate: Had not thy Father Atreus, at a Banquet, A dreadful Banquet! from whose Sight the Sun Turn'd back eclips'd, serv'dâMonstrous!âup to mine, To his own Brother, to the pale Thyestes, His murder'd Sons: didst thou not wear a Crown Then by thy Father ravish'd from our Line, MycenÃ¦'s Crown, which he unjustly seiz'd, And added to his own, to that of Argos: Had I not stain'd thy Bed with Clytemnestra: Tho' Safety did not urge, and Self-defence: Yet this vile Treatment, Treatment fit for Slaves; Thanks to thy Fury! this has fix'd thy Doom. Some foolish Scruples, that still hung about me, Are by this friendly Tempest blown away.â But Clytemnestra comes. How shall I calm Her troubled Mind? How bring her to my Purpose? SCENE VII. Clytemnestra, Egisthus. Clytemnestra. Here let me kneel, Egisthus, grasp thy Knees; Here let me grow till my Request be granted. Now is the very Crisis of my Fate. Egisthus. What Sight is this I see? Rise, Clytemnestra! Thou fairest most majestic of thy Sex! It misbecomes thee much this suppliant Posture. O there is nothing, nothing, sure, which you Need stoop to ask! speak, and command it, Madam. Clytemnestra. Then let us henceforth be, as if this Love Had never been betwixt us. Egisthus. Cease to love thee! What wild Demand! Impossible!âEven now, Endear'd by Danger, by Distress endear'd, I for thee feel a fonder Pang, than e'er I felt before. Clytemnestra. No! these deluding Words Can charm no longer; their Enchantment flies; And in my Breast the guilty Passions jar, Unkind, unjoyous, unharmonious all. Ah me! from real Happiness we stray, By Vice bewilder'd; Vice, which always leads, However fair at first, to Wilds of Woe. Egisthus. Ah! Clytemnestra! didst thou loveâ Clytemnestra. No more! Seduce my Soul no more! Here will I stopâ Beyond this Line 'tis Misery, 'tis Madness, The Furies flash their Torches, Vultures tear, The mingled Tortures of the Damn'd await me. Oh! if your Passion be not meerly selfish, If the least Tenderness for me you feel, Drive me no farther down the Gulph of Woe! To Happiness I bid a last Farewell; I ask not Happiness; no, that I leave To Innocence and Virtue; Peace, alone, Some poor Remains of Peace is all I ask, Not to be greatly wretched, plung'd in Horrors! And yet, who knows, the heavenly Spark, that sleeps Beneath these Embers, yet may spread anew Its chearful LustreâAll may yet be wellâ For Agamemnon was so kind, so gentle, With such a holy tender Flame he burn'd, As might have kindled in a barbarous Breast Humanity and Virtue. Egisthus. All Pretence. I guess his Aim; I penetrate his Purpose. On you he lavish'd Fondness, while on me He lowr'd Destruction. Doubtless, with his Ear, Some Villain has been busy; and he means First to divide us, then, with greater Ease, To ruin both.âAnd can you then be caught, Caught with these common prostituted Speeches, That oft have sicken'd on the glowing Lip Of many a Trojan Slave? ChryseÃ¯s had them; BriseÃ¯s too: and now Cassandra, she, Who, liker a triumphant Queen than Captive, Is every hour expectedâ Clytemnestra. What Cassandra? Egisthus. O it imports you little what Cassandra! Thus poorly, tame you ne'er will want Cassandra's. What is become of Clytemnestra's Spirit, That she can thus forget her high Descent, Forget her Rank, her Honour, nay forget Her Injuries? Clytemnestra. But what Cassandra, say? Egisthus. Why Priam's Daughter, the prophetic Princess, The proud, the young, the beautiful Cassandra: So vain of Heart, she dreamt Apollo lov'd her, And, on her plighted Faith to crown his Love, Bestow'd the Gift of Prophecy; the Gift In her possession, she deceiv'd the God; Whence he, provok'd, with this Condition dash'd it, Of never gaining Credit. So the Tale, The Fable runsâYet, on my Soul, I think, Did she give out, she should be Queen of Argos, She were indeed a Prophetess. Clytemnestra. 'Tis well. You mean it for an Insult this, you do. What else could tempt you to deride me, Sir, With such Extravagance? Egisthus. Mistake me not, I mean it, Madam, for a serious Truth, I mean it for a Certainty, if thus You droop, unnerv'd with these dejecting Fears. Clytemnestra. Cassandra Queen of Argos! Egisthus. Yes, of Argos; While Clytemnestra in a Prison pines; Where she may weep, and moralize at leisure. Clytemnestra. By Heavens! she visits first her Father's Shade! Egisthus. There shone your native Self. Let bright Revenge, I should say Justice, dissipate these Clouds, These melancholy Whims of ill-judg'd Virtue, And show you burning with your former Lustre. Madam, our Fates are blended: know, we stand Or fall together. Shame Contempt and Ruin, Or Safety Love and Glory, is our Choice. And need we doubt a Moment? Clytemnestra. But, Egisthusâ Egisthus. I know the Purpose of thy pleading Eye. Of that hereafterâWe shall meet againâ My Presence now is wanted in the City. Fear nothingâThou shalt know before we act, Thou, for whose sake alone I act and live! The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Arcas, Melisander. Arcas. And have I found my long-lost Friend again? My Melisander! But so chang'd your Look, So sickly'd with a kind of thoughtful Sadness, So sunk each Feature, by seven drooping Years Spent in that desart Isle, as baffled quite My wandering Recollection. Melisander. True, dear Arcas: For what a helpless Creature, by himself, Is the proud Lord of this inferior World, Vain feeble Man! The Commoners of Nature, Each Wing that flits along the spacious Sky, Is less dependant than their boasted Master. Hail social Life! into thy pleasing Bounds Again I come, to pay the common Stock My Share of Service; and, in glad Return, To taste thy Comforts, thy protected Joys. Arcas. O greatly welcome! You deserve them well, You well deserve the social Life you polish. Still on my thought your strange Delivery dwells. By Agamemnon left to aid the Queen, With faithful Counsel, while he warr'd at Troy; And thus by Agamemnon to be sav'd, Returning from that Conquest! Wondrous Chance! Or rather wondrous Conduct of the Gods! By Mortals, from their Blindness, Chance misnam'd. Mean time, instruct me, while the King reposes, How was you snatch'd away? And how, so long, Could you this dreadful Solitude support? I burn to know the whole. Melisander. 'Tis thus, my Friend. While sunk in unsuspecting Sleep I lay, Some midnight Ruffians rush'd into my Chamber, Sent by Egisthus, who my Presence deem'd Obstructive (so I solve it) to his Views; Black Views I fear, as you perhaps may know. Sudden they seiz'd, and, muffled up in Darkness, Strait bore me to the Sea, whose instant Prey I did conclude my self, when first, around The Ship unmoor'd, I heard the chiding Wave. But these fell Tools of cruel Power, it seems, Had orders in a desart Isle to leave me; There hopeless, helpless, comfortless, to prove The utmost Gall and Bitterness of Death. Thus Malice often overshoots it self, And some unguarded Accident betrays The Man of Blood.âNext Nightâa dreary Night! Cast on the wildest of the Cyclade Isles, Where never human Foot had mark'd the Shore, These Ruffians left meâYet, believe me, Arcas, Such is the rooted Love we bear Mankind, All Ruffians as they were, I never heard A Sound so dismal as their parting Oars.â Then horrid Silence follow'd, broke alone By the low Murmurs of the restless Deep, Mixt with the doubtful Breeze, that now and then Sigh'd thro' the mournful Woods. Beneath a Shade I sat me down, more heavily oppress'd, More desolate at Heart, than e'er I felt Before. When Philomela, o'er my Head, Began to tune her melancholy Strain, As piteous of my Woes; till, by degrees, The balmy Sleep on wounded Nature shed A kind but short Relief. At early Morn, Wak'd by the Chaunt of Birds, I look'd around For usual Objects: Objects found I none, Except before me stretch'd the toiling Main, And Rocks and Woods, in savage View, behind. Wrapt for a Moment in amaz'd Confusion, My Thought turn'd giddy round; when, all at once, To Memory full my dire Condition rush'd. Arcas. But of each Comfort each Convenience void, How could you Life sustain? how fence against Inclement Skies? Melisander. A mossy Cave, that fac'd The Southern Sea, and in whose deep Recess Boil'd up a lovely Fountain, was my Home. Herbs were my Food, those blessed Stores of Health! Only when Winter, from my daily Search, Withdrew my verdant Meal, I was oblig'd In faithless Snares to seize, which truly griev'd me, My sylvan Friends; that ne'er till then had known, And therefore dreaded less the Tyrant Man. But these low Hardships scarce deserve Regard: The Pangs, that sharpest stung, were in my Mind; There Desolation reign'd; and there, cut off From social Life, I felt a constant Death. And yet these Pangs at last forgot to throb: What cannot lenient gentle Time perform? I eat my lonely Meal without a Tear; Nor sigh'd to see the dreadful Night descend. In my own Breast, a World within my self, In Streams, in Groves, in sunny Hill and Shade; In all that blooms with vegetable Life, Or joys with kindred animal Sensation; In the full-peopled Round of azure Heaven; Where'er I, studious, look'd, I found Companions. But, chief, the Muses lent their softning Aid. At their enchanting Voice my Sorrows fled, Or learn'd to please; while, thro' my troubled Heart, They breath'd the Soul of Harmony anew. Thus, of the great Community of Nature, A Denizen I liv'd; and oft, in Hymns, And rapturous Thought, even with the Gods convers'd, That not disdain sometimes the Walks of Man. So pass'd the Time, when, lo! within my Call, Arriv'd the Ship, which Hope had often promis'dâ The Ship!âO it surpass'd my fondest Dream, E'er to imagine the gay Ship that came! As on the Deck I Agamemnon saw, All glorious with the Spoils of conquer'd Troy; Ye Gods! what Transport, what Amazement seiz'd me! What Adoration of your wondrous Ways! Expression sinks beneath them. Arcas. Sweet Reward Of manly Patience! that, to Fortune still Superior, scorns Despair. Melisander. This Theme, my Friend, Will better suit a leisurable Hour. The high Concerns of Life now claim our Care. I have already to the King imparted Suspicions of Egisthus, and remain In this Disguise, not to alarm his Guilt, Till it more full appear, and proper Steps To punish his Misgovernment be taken. If he has ill Designs, you, Arcas, you Must, while you seem'd regardless, must have pierc'd them. Your calm but keen Inspection, not disturb'd By the vain Flutter of ill-tim'd Discourse, Must reach the very Bottom of his Purpose. In you the King confides, of you demands, As of his best-lov'd Subject in MycenÃ¦, The Truth. Arcas. O, I have precious Truths in store! And that best Treasure will unlock before him. Long has my silent Observation trac'd Egisthus, thro' the doubling Maze of Treason, But now his ill Designs are too too plain, To all MycenÃ¦ plain: and who, indeed, Who can have good ones, that corrupts a People? It was, however, hard, a bitter Task! To wink at publick Villany; to wipe Each honest Passion from my livid Face, To bind my Hands, and seal my quiv'ring Lips, While my Heart burn'd with Rage, and treasur'd up A Storm of Indignationâ Melisander. Give it way! O 'tis a glorious Luxury! Opprest, For Years, beneath a Load of wicked Power, To heave it off indignant, and assert The dear dear Freedom of a virtuous Mind. Curse on the Coward or perfidious Tongue, That dares not, even to Kings, avow the Truth! Let Traitors wrap them in delusive Incense, On Flattery Flattery heap, on Falshood Falshood: Truth is the living liberal Breath of Heaven; That sweeps these Fogs away, with all their Vermin. And, on my Soul, methinks, that Agamemnon Deserves some touch of Blame. To put the Power, The Power of blessing or oppressing Millions, Of doing or great Good or equal Mischief, Even into doubtful Hands, is worse than careless. Ye Gods, avert the Miseries that hence On him and on his Family may fall! But, see, the King. SCENE II. Agamemnon, Melisander, Arcas. Agamemnon. Nay, Arcas, to my Bosom, (Arcas kneeling.) Come, let me proudly take a faithful Heart! Arcas. Thrice welcome, Sir, to Argos and MycenÃ¦! To Virtue welcome! Agamemnon. In my own Dominions. I am a Stranger, Arcas. Ten full Years, Or even one Day, is Absence for a King, Without some mighty Reason, much too long. For me, a just and memorable War, Whose Actions future Times perhaps may sing, My own, my Brother's, and my People's Honour, With that of common Greece, must plead my Pardon. Now shall my Cares attend the Works of Peace: Calm Deeds, that glare not on the vulgar Eye; And yet it equal Courage oft demands, To quell Injustice, Riot, factious Rage, Dark-working blind Cabals and bold Disorder, As to confront the rigid Face of War. Then tell me, Arcas, for, till self-inform'd, I mean to see with your discerning Eyes, And sure I am they never will mislead me; Have I much Subject for this peaceful Courage? This Fortitude of State? Arcas. Too much, my Lord. Would to the Gods, our Virtues, here at home, Could answer your Heroic Deeds abroad! You, doubtless, from the rugged School of War, Have brought sound manly Hearts, and generous Spirits: While we, alas! we rot in weedy Peace, In slothful Riot, Luxury, Profusion, And every Meanness to repair that Wasteâ I see the noble Blood, indignant, mount, At this Relation, to my Sovereign's Cheek: But, as Affairs now press, I were a Traitor, If with a sparing Tongue I spoke the Truth. Agamemnon. Immortal Gods! have I, these ten long Years, Sustain'd a War at Troy; fill'd every day With Cares incessant, Councils, Dangers, Toils, Exploits of daring Brow, and signal Deeds, To cherish Villains in licentious Ease? Have I thus squander'd vile, on Phrygian Plains, The bravest Blood of Greece to shelter such; And to assert their Honour who have none? It was not well, methought, when Melisander I in a desart Island pining found, Abandon'd there, by Cruelty supreme; Methought it was not well. Foul is the State, And ill Designs ferment, when honest Eyes With Woods alone converse, and rural Scenes. But what can this perfidious, this Egisthus, What can he, say, by such loose Rule propose? Is it his native Bent? Or does he push Some dark Design, by these detested Means? Arcas. There is no Vice a Stranger to his Heart, Conceal'd beneath refin'd Dissimulation; Dissimulation, that on you your self Impos'd. Meantime, Sir, his outragious Views Devour the Throne of Argos and MycenÃ¦. Agamemnon. Said you the Throne of Argos and MycenÃ¦? Already have I lost my noblest Throne, If he has robb'd me of my People's Virtue; 'Tis but vain Pomp, a Tyrant's Toy, the other. And dares he bear a giddy Look so high, As to my Throne? The Villain! sure he dares not. Arcas. Nay more, my LordâHe scales the dazzling Height, And almost grasps with impious Hands your Sceptre. Agamemnon. To touch it is Perdition!âWhat! Egisthus! Egisthus seize my Throne! Arcas. So means the Traitor. Agamemnon. That Creature of my Power! That Insect! rais'd By the warm Beams of my mistaken Bounty! Whom, when my Father's Vengeance raz'd his Race, I sav'd, train'd up, with Favours, Honours heap'd; And trusted in his hands at last a Jewel, Too precious for the faithless Heart of Manâ O gross gross BlindnessâHalf my Kingly Pow'r! Ay, there breaks out his Father's treacherous Blood! There, there, too late, I find the base Thyestes! Forgive me, Atreus! Oh my royal Father! Forgive my trusting thus the Seed of him, Of an abhor'd an execrable Brother, Who even profan'd thy BedâBut, ere yon Orb Shall from the purpled Ocean rise again, Oh injur'd Atreus! by thy sacred Shade I swear, to make for this a full Atonement. Is then this People, Arcas, grown so vile, So very vile, that he dares entertain The smallest Hope to rival me in Empire? I like not vauntingâBut, ungrateful People! Can you prefer a nameless thing to me? Am I not rough with Scars on your account? And for the careful Love I always bore you, Your Father nam'd? And yet prefer to me, One who ne'er saw the glorious Front of War, For nothing famous but corrupting Peace, And whose sole Merit was my ill-judg'd Favour? Can youâaway!âDishonour stains the Thought! How should this be? Arcas. Not many, Sir, stand fix'd On the deep Principles of reason'd Virtue, Whom Time nor steals, nor Passion bears away. Mankind, in general, float along the Stream Of Custom; good or bad; and oft the Mind To that familiar grows, by gradual Use And still-encroaching Vice, whose first Regard Gave Horror. Hence ten loosely-govern'd Years Have wrought such strange Events, that you no more Behold your antient Argos and MycenÃ¦. These Cities now with Slaves and Villains swarm. At first Egisthus, popular and fair, All Smiles and Softness, as if each Man's Friend, By hidden Ways proceeded, mining Virtue: He Pride, he Pomp, he Luxury diffus'd; He taught them Wants, beyond their private Means: And strait, in Bounty's pleasing Chains involv'd, They grew his Slaves. Who cannot live on little, Or as his various Fortune shall permit, Stands in the Market ready to be sold. Agamemnon. O damn'd detested Traffick!âBut proceed. Arcas. While the luxurious Fever thus increas'd, Still, in proportion as it gather'd Rage, He lent it Fewel; and, more bold, disclos'd His Noon-day Treason. Murmurs went about, And spread at last into the common Talk, That you was proud, severe, beneath the Mask Of holding firm the Helm of State, a Tyrant; That in vain Wars, which nought imported them, You spent their Treasure, shed their noblest Blood; And that, Troy conquer'd once, to her rich Plains You meant from Argos to transplant your Empire. Mean time, in private, all, whom wild Debauch Has set adrift from every human Tie; Whom Riot, Want, and conscious Guilt inflame, Holding the Gods and Virtue in contempt, Amidst their Bowls; such are his Bosom-Friends: And, join'd to them, a meaner ruffian Band, Whose Trade is Murder, and whose Harvest Crimes, Hang in black Cloud around him; whence, I fear, A sudden Tempest is prepar'd to burst. This, Sir, from Duty and unfeigned Zeal, I plain unfold: nor on my word, alone, Believe these Accusations; clear as day, I for them will produce the strongest Proof. Agamemnon. I thank thee, Arcas. Truth, tho' sometimes clad In painful Lustre, yet is always welcome, Dear as the Light, that shows the lurking Rock: 'Tis the fair Star that, ne'er into the Main Descending, leads us safe thro' stormy Lifeâ Gods! how it tears me from each calmer Thought! To think this Traitor, that this double Traitor, This Traitor to my self and to my People, Should by such sneaking such unmanly Ways, Thus filch away my Crown!â Why stand I chafing here? One timely Deed Is worth ten thousand WordsâCome then, my Friends, Come and behold me seize amidst his Guards, His Coward GuardsâGuilt ever was a Cowardâ This Rival-King, and with him crown my Triumph. Till then Troy smoaks in vain, and Agamemnon Cannot be said to conquer. Melisander. Sir, bewareâ Agamemnon. Of what beware? Where am I, Melisander? Am I not in MycenÃ¦? in my Palace? Are not these Crouds, that stream along the Streets, My Subjects all? Of what should I beware? Not seize a Traitor in my own Dominions? Yes I will seize him, Melisander,âwill! Melisander. What Grace to Kings such generous Ardor gives! But tho' brave Deeds be warm at first conceiv'd, Let the best Purpose cool, nor miss your Blow. More firm and sure the Hand of Courage strikes, When it obeys the watchful Eye of Caution. You hear from Arcas, Sir, what ruffian Bands, What secret Deaths, what Daggers lurk around him: Be cautious then; for Virtue's, Glory's sake! And, when you strike, strike home. Agamemnon. O for those Greeks! That this rude Day are tossing on the Seas; Those hardy Greeks, whom ten Years War has steel'd; With Toils, with Danger, and with Death familiar: Then should you see what Chaff before the Wind Are these weak Sons of soft enfeebling Peace; While I the sweetest Morsel of the Gods Enjoy'd, on proud triumphant Vice just Vengeance. Melisander. But since, my Lord, you cannot now exert This nobler Force, let Prudence take its place. Have patience, only, till you safely can, And surely, seize him. Agamemnon. Well, till then I will. And, tho' not made of patient Mold, in This I will have patience, will, some tedious Hours, Repress my Vengeanceâ [pausing.] Yes, I like the Thoughtâ He may be seiz'd this Evening at the Banquet, Be there surpriz'd with easeâand shall!â For by th'eternal Gods that rule Mankind! The Sleep of Death alone shall seal these Eyes, While such a Wretch holds power in my Dominions. Oh Clytemnestra! to the publick, now, Succeeds the private PangâAt thought of Thee, New Rage new Vengeance shake my inmost Soul! Was my Belov'd, my Queen, my Clytemnestra, So long abandon'd in a Villain's power, Who knows, it seems, no Limits, owns no Laws, Save those one Vice imposes on another? And now the secret Cause, I fear, is plain, Of that unusual Damp, that strange Dejection, Which clouded her at Meeting. Still the more I pour'd my Fondness, still the more distress'd She seem'd; and, turning from my tender Gaze, The copious Shower stole down her troubled Cheek; As if she pity'd these my blind Endearments, And in her Breast some horrid Secret swell'dâ Should it be soâConfusion!âCan I stoop Even to suppose it!âHow from slight Mistakes Great Evils spring! But the most fruitful Source Of every EvilâO that I, in Thunder, Could sound it o'er the listning Earth to Kings!â Is Delegating Power to wicked Hands. Melisander. My Lord, let no Suspicions of the Queen E'er taint your Bosom: if I judge arightâ Agamemnon. No, Melisander, no; I am not jealous; In me that Passion and Contempt were one: No, 'tis her Situation gives me Horror, Her dreadful Situation!âBut of This EnoughâThen tell me, Arcas, tell me truely; Are there a Few, say, do there yet remain A Faithful Few! to save the sinking State? Can you, ere Night, collect an honest Band, A Band of such as worthy are to rescue Their King and Country from impending Fate? Ah! little thought I, that amidst my Subjects, Embosom'd sweet in Peace, I, like a Tyrant, Should e'er have needed Guards. Arcas. Yes, Sir, I know A Band of generous Youth, whom native Virtue, Unbroken yet by Avarice and Meanness, Fits for our purpose: These I can collectâ Agamemnon. About it quickly, Arcas; lose no time: Go, bring me to the Banquet these brave Youths: I long for their Acquaintance. Till that Hour, Domestick Cares and Joys demand my Presence: The Father's Heart now bears me to my Children. Farewell! My All depends upon your Conduct. End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Agamemnon, Melisander. Agamemnon. Domestick Pleasures spread their Charms in vainâ O for the Hour of Vengeance! I, till then, But stalk about, the Shadow of a King. Heard you from Arcas aught? Melisander. Be patient, Sir. As yet the Time permits not his Return. Arcas is zealous ardent in your Service, And will not fail his Duty. Enter an Officer belonging to the Court. Officer. Sir, Cassandra Is just arriv'd. Agamemnon. Conduct the Princess hither. This Priam's fairest Daughter, Melisander, Is a young Princess of engaging Beauty, Rais'd by Distress; of noble Sense and Spirit But, by Poetic Visions led astray, She dreamt Apollo lov'd her, and the Gift Of Prophecy bestow'd, to gain her Promise: The Gift once her's, the chastly-faithless Maid Deceiv'd the God; who therefore, in Revenge, Since he could not recall it, made it useless, For ever doom'd to meet with Disregard. E'er-since the lovely Visionary raves, With Dignity; foretels the Fate of Nations; And, judging of the Future from the Past, Has oft been wond'rous happy in her Guesses. Some strange some recent Instances of This, Confirm her in her venerable Madness. Melisander. Be not too rash in judging, Agamemnon; For we, blind Mortals, but a little know Of boundless NatureâHark! the Princess comes: I hear her Voice, I hear the Voice of Sorrow. SCENE II. Agamemnon, Melisander, Cassandra attended by Trojan Captives. Cassandra , entering. O hostile Roofs! O Ilium! O my Country! Agamemnon. I cannot blame your Grief, unhappy Princess! But, if it can relieve you, here be sure Of an Asylum, safe as Priam's Palace. Cassandra. O sweet Abode! O Palace of my Fathers! My Heart bleeds Transport while I think of Thee; Think of the Days of Innocence and Joy, That shone upon me there. How chang'd, alas! Ah! what a Scene, when I beheld thee last! Rage, Blood, and Flames, and Shrieks of Murder round me! The Sword of Pyrrhus, and a feeble Father! Where was you Hector then? Where all his Sons? O Priam's numerous Race! what are you now Become? Ah me! the desolating Gods Have laid their Hands, their iron Hands, upon us. Agamemnon. From past Misfortunes, Princess, turn your Eyeâ Cassandra. 'Tis true, the future may full well suffice. Th'avenging Sisters trace my Footsteps still, The Hunters still pursue the trembling Doe. Where am I?âGods!âBlack heavy Drops of Blood Run down the guilty WallsâWith the dun Shades Of Night ascending, lo! successive Troops Of Trojan Ghosts are flocking to the Banquet: Permitted by th'infernal Gods, they come, To feast them with the Horrors of this Night, To snuff the Blood of VictimsâHa! the Car, The gay triumphal Car, is turn'd, at once, Into a mournful Bier, that nods along, Solemn and slowâYes, Troy shall be aveng'd: I shall the Vengeance see; and yet not see Thy Light, returning PhÅbus. Agamemnon. Fair Cassandra, Indulge no more these melancholy Views, These Visions form'd by gloomy-minded Grief. We will each Art each tender Art employ, To sooth your Sorrows, to restore your Peace. You come not to the proud unfeeling Race Of Yesterday: we know the Turns of Fortune; Have drank the Cup, the wholesome Cup, of Sufferings, That not inflames but moderates the Mind. Then fear not, Princess; let me call you Daughter! Your Treatment shall be such as well becomes The Dignity of Woe, becomes the great The fair Unhappy. Nought shall touch your Honour. I know, I feel your Beauty: but here dwell The Gods of Hospitality and Faith; The Hymeneal Powers are honour'd here. Yes, I will shield Thee, equal with Electra, With my lov'd Daughter, in thy Friendship blest. Cassandra. In spite of swelling Tears that choak the Way, Of bitter Tears by big Remembrance shed, I own thy Goodness, thank Thee, Agamemnon. Mean time, in vain, are all thy generous Cares, On my account. The Gods of Death will, soon, Extend o'er me their all-protecting Wing. I shall not long, I shall not want Protection: But, who, devoted Prince, will give it Thee? Even while we talk the secret Wheels are turning, That lift the Vile, and lay the Mighty low. I pity Thee, the House of Pelops pity: Forgive me, Troy: I pity thy Destroyers. Enter an Officer. Officer. A Messenger from Arcas, Sirâ Agamemnon. 'Tis well. To my Apartment lead himâYou, mean while, [To Melisander. Attend the Princess; grace her with such Honours, As suits Her to receive, and Me to give. SCENE III. Cassandra, Chorus of Trojan Captives, Melisander. Melisander. Fair Princess, stop these Tears. Exert that best That noblest Virtue, which can master Fortune, An equal Mind. Cassandra. Not for my self I weep!â But, oh my dear Companions! How for you My Bosom yearns! Chorus. We have together liv'd Together let us die! Cassandra. Together liv'd! At This ten thousand Images awake, Ten thousand little Tendernesses throb. Chorus. O Days of Youth! O careless Days! Untaught To weep, if Love not own'd the pleasing Tear. Cassandra. O Woods! O Fountains! O delightful Meads! That lent us Flowers, the Prime of blooming May, To deck our Tresses. Chorus. O the yellow Banks Of fair Scamander! in whose silver Stream, We us'd to bathe, beneath the secret Shade. Cassandra. O chearful Ida's airy Summits! where The Gods delight to dwell. Chorus. O silent Troy! Whose Streets have often echo'd with our Song. Cassandra. O the lost Labours of a ruin'd People! O Country! Freedom! Friends! Relations! All, That gives or taste or dignity to Life, All all is gone, beyond recovery gone! Chorus. Then let us die! Cassandra. For me, the hunted Hart More fervent pants not for the cooling Stream, Than I to wrap me in the quiet Shades Of Death. But, ah! my helpless Friends, for you I feel it's keenest Anguish. Chorus. Not for us, Feel not for us. What Comfort have we left? What Hope, what Wish in Life?âOne healing Pang, And then we weep no more. Cassandra. Refreshing Thought! And then from Bondage, Pain, from every Ill, For ever free, we meet our Friends again; Our Parents, Brothers, Sisters, Lovers meet. Chorus. Then let us die! and sudden be the Blow! Cassandra. The Gods assent.âBehold the happy Shore! But, ah! there lies a stormy Sea betwixt! Melisander. So sings the plaining Nightingale her Woes. Cassandra. Ah, far unlike the Nightingale!âShe sings, Unceasing, thro' the balmy Nights of May; She sings from Love and Joy, while we, alas!â Melisandra. Behold the QueenâDeep-wrap'd in Thought she seems.â Cassandra. O direful Musings!âLead us from her Presence. SCENE IV. Chytemnestra. Sweet Peace of Mind! whence Pleasure borrows Taste, Daughter of Virtue! whither art thou fled? To what calm Cottage, to what blameless Shade, Far from these guilty Walls? O Walls! O Race! To Horrors doom'd!âBefore me gathers fast A deepning Gloom, with unknown Terrors big.â Not quite unknown.âGods! what a dreadful Hint Flash'd from Egisthus, when I saw him last! And to what desperate Actions cannot Safety, Ambition, Love and Vengeance drive the Soul!â Distraction lies that wayâyet, how escape? Shame urges on behind, unpitying Shame, That worst of Furies, whose fell Aspect frights Each tender Feeling from the human Breast. Goodness it self even turns in me to Gall, And serves alone to heighten my Despair. How kind was Agamemnon! generous! fond! How more than usual mild! As if, on purpose, To give these Tortures their severest Sting. Happy! compar'd to this tormented State, Where Honour only lives, with inward Lash, To punish Guilt, happy the harden'd Wretch, Who feels no Conscience, and who fears no Crime!â Oh Horrid! Horrid! Oh flagitious Thought! How is it with the Mind that can endure A Thought so dire!âMy sole remaining Hope Is Death, kind Death, that amiable Sleep, Which wakes no more,âat least to mortal Care.â But then the dark Hereafter that may come.â There is no Anchor that against this Storm, This mighty Sea of Doubts and Fears, can hold. Hopeless, I drive.âOne Thought destroys another.â This Stranger too!âShould it be Melisanderâ Is there a Fear, however idle, wild, And even almost impossible, which Guilt, The feeble-hearted Guilt not entertains?â I order'd his Attendance.âSee, he comes. SCENE V. Clytemnestra, Melisander. Clytemnestra. Are you not Stranger, he, whom Agamemnon, By an amazing Chance, in his Return, Sav'd from a desart Isle? Melisander. Madam, the same. Clytemnestra. I much admire your fortunate Deliverance, And wish to hear your Story: Why there left, And how sustain'd. Indulge me with it, Stranger. Melisander. Madam, I come this moment from the King, Charg'd with a Matter which requires Dispatch: But that transacted once, without Delay, I will attend your Orders. Clytemnestra. Then, it seems, You are not quite a Stranger in MycenÃ¦. What is your Country? Melisander. Greece. Clytemnestra. What Part of Greece? Melisander. I am of Athens born. Clytemnestra. But in MycenÃ¦, Have you not in MycenÃ¦ been before? Melisander. There are not, Madam, many Parts of Greece To me unknown. Clytemnestra. Why thus avoid my Question?â Have you been here before? Melisander. Madam, I have. Clytemnestra. Here in this Palace?âHa! why stand you silent? You keep your Eyes unmov'd upon the Ground. What should this mean? Beneath that rough Disguise There lurks, methinks, a Form, which somewhere I Have seen. Melisander. The Dream of Fancy, that the more It is indulg'd, perplexes still the more. I tarry here too long; the King's Commands Admit of no Delay. Clytemnestra. 'Tis so! 'tis so! Air, Features, Manner, Voice, this study'd Haste, The Shifts of one unpractis'd in Deceit, All all conspireâOne Image wakes another, And thick they flash upon me! Melisander. You grow pale, You tremble, Madam; that Mistake, I find, Concerning me turns wilder and disturbs you. Let me retireâ Clytemnestra. A Momentâstayâ Melisander. In vain, I find it is in vain to wrap me longer In these Evasions. Clytemnestra. Melisander! Melisander. Madamâ Clytemnestra. And can it be? Behold I then the Man, Whom I so long have number'd with the Dead? Almighty Gods! Behold I Melisander? But, ah! how chang'd! how darken'd with Suspicion! Yes I am deem'd the Author of his Woes. Melisander. Madam, forgiveâ Clytemnestra. Why else from me conceal Your wish'd ReturnâI plainly am distrustedâ By Agamemnon tooâIt was unkind, Unjust, unfriendly, shocks me, Melisander. Melisander. Indeed you wrong me, Madam, wrong me much; To judge me apt or to conceive or spread Distrust. I would have perish'd by my self, Unknown, unwept, in helpless Solitude, Rather than here return, to this full World, To set my Mistress and her Lord at variance. O think me not a busy Peace-Destroyer! Accursed is the Wretch, to social Life The most inhuman Foe, who in the nice The tender Scenes of Life, dares rashly meddle, And sow Division between Friends and Lovers. Clytemnestra. The generous Heart is ever slow to blame. But, Melisander, not to me were owing, Not in the least to me, those cruel Woes, This worse than Death, which you so long have suffer'd. Instead of That, your Fate, how, whither gone, If carry'd off, or secretly destroy'd, Was all a mournful Mystery to me, Dark as the Night on which you disappear'd. Did you but know, here in my secret Soul, What undissembled Pangs your Absence rouz'd; What I have felt for you, and for my self, In losing such a wise and faithful Friend; Knew you but these, O knew you, Melisander, How your Disaster has been truely mine, You never could suspect me. Melisander. Witness Heav'n! I never didâYour Heart I know disdains A Thought that looks like Cruelty or Fraud. From the first moment that his Ruffians seiz'd me, I had no doubt, I knew it was Egisthus. Some time before I mark'd the rising Storm, And meant to warn you, as it sudden burst, And bore me far away, far from all Means, Even from all Hope of lending you assistance. Ay! there I suffer'd most. My Fears for you, At once by Guile and Violence beset, Took off the Point of my own proper Woes. But when your awful Virtues struck my Thought, Your Wisdom, Spirit, Resolution, Truth; That dread Effulgence of the spotless Soul, Which smites the hardest Villain into Shame; My Fears appear'd impertinent and vain. Yet doubtless, Madam, you have had occasion For a firm ruling Hand and watchful Eye, For every Virtue; and I truly joy, That Agamemnon finds, at his Return, Egisthus by your Conduct thus restrain'd. Clytemnestra. By Heavens! he tries me.âO suspicious Guilt! [Aside. Your Words are friendly, but your Deeds are doubtful. No, Melisander, Friendship with Distrust Can never dwell. And that I am distrusted To me is certainâIn a Matter too, That much concern'd my Peace, concern'd my Honour. For did you even ascribe your Woes to me, You could not manage with more distant Caution. Melisander. Whence is it that the noble Clytemnestra, Who us'd to shine in a superior Sphere Of fair Serenity and candid Peace, Should to these Doubts descend, these dark Suspicions? For me, I here attest the Gods, my Soul Ne'er knew a Thought, that swell'd not with Esteem, With Love, and Veneration of your Virtues. And for the King, no young enraptur'd Lover, In all the first Effusions of his Soul, New to the mighty Charm; no Friend, who meets, After long Years of dark and silent Absence, His happy Friend again, feels livelier Joy, Than Agamemnon feels, while his glad Tongue Runs out in endless Praise of Clytemnestraâ But I must wait his Orders.â Clytemnestra. Do your Duty. I too must go, must to Egisthus, strait, [Aside. Impart this dreadful News. SCENE VI. Melisander , alone. She went abruptlyâ And as we talk'd, methought strange Passions shook Her inward Frame, and darken'd every Feature. Behold the black, the guilt-concealing Night Fast closes round. Wide, thro' this ample Palace, The Lamps begin to shine. The Tempest falls; The weary Winds sink, breathless. But, who knows, What fiercer Tempest yet may shake this Night. Soul-chearing PhÅbus, with thy sacred Beams, O quickly come, and chase these sullen Shadows. End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Clytemnestra, Egisthus. Egisthus. Ah Clytemnestra! what a Change is here! And must I then thus steal an Interview? Are we alone? Clytemnestra. You fright me with that Question: You look astonish'd. Egisthus. On the Brink of Ruin We, tott'ring, stand. Clytemnestra. That is no News to me. Egisthus. Butâ Clytemnestra. What? Egisthus. We are discover'd. Clytemnestra. Ha! discover'd! Egisthus. Yes certainly discover'd. Arcas now, By Agamemnon's Orders, in the City, Collects a Band to seize me at the Banquet, A short Hour hence. And my Accusers, Madam, You may be well assur'd are not your Friends. Clytemnestra. 'Tis plain! 'tis plain!âThe parting Fogs disperse: And now the doubtful Scene stands all reveal'dâ Who could have thought they should dissemble thus? But I can tell you more. Egisthus. What, Madam? speak; For Danger presses on us. Clytemnestra. Saw you him, This seeming Stranger, sav'd by Agamemnon. Egisthus. Arcas and he to-day, my Friends inform me, Were busy with the King; and doubtless, then, It was concerted that I should be seiz'd. Clytemnestra. Ah! did you know, Egisthus, who he is?â Egisthus. Who? Clytemnestra. Melisander. Egisthus. Gods! and does he live? For my Confusion sav'd! O gross, gross Folly! To do an Action of that kind by halves. Had he been silent DustâTo please you, Madam, Because of that Regard you deign'd to bear him, From a false Tenderness for you, he livesâ Clytemnestra. A mighty Merit! Glorious Boast indeed! Hear him, ye weeping gentle Powers of Love! From Tenderness for me, he did not murder A worthy blameless Man, who never hurt him; He murder'd not my Friend, my faithful Friend. Ah! 'tis such Tenderness as makes me wretched! Such Tenderness, that still in blacker Guilt, In the last Deeps of Misery, would plunge me. Egisthus. It is not, Madam, now a time for This. Think of our Situation: close beset By all those Ills which Mortals most abhor. Whom have we to confide in but each other? And this sad Meeting is perhaps our last. Concord alone, and vigorous Measures, can Prevent our RuinâBut, from Melisander, What did you learn? Are you your self suspected? Clytemnestra. I cannot find I am:âAnd yet I must. Egisthus. But, as for me, my Ruin is no Secret? Clytemnestra. 'Tis true, some dark Attempt goes on against you. Egisthus. Then have I rightly done. Clytemnestra. What have you done? Egisthus. What Prudence, Justice, Love and Vengeance, all Demandâ Clytemnestra. Immortal Powers! you have not?â Egisthus. No: But must, and willâWhat else can you propose? Clytemnestra. Oh, any thing besides! Immediate Flight, Eternal Absence, Death!â Egisthus. Let others die! Let the proud faithless false injurious Tyrant; The Hero glorious in his Daughter's Murder; The Scourge of Greece, who has, from wild Ambition, Shed so much Bloodâlet Agamemnon die! Clytemnestra. Oh Heavens and Earth! you shock me to Distraction! I have, Egisthus, hitherto avoided This dreadful Point, still hoping you might drop Your horrid Resolution: now I tell you, Before the listening Gods, I plainly tell you, That Agamemnon shall not fall, unwarn'd: You shall not rise by me into his Throne: I will not be the Tool of your Ambition; Will not be wretched infamous for ever, The Blush of Woman, the Disgrace of Nature! That you may gain your execrable Views, Mask'd under smooth Pretences.âI am guilty; Alas! I amâBut think not therefore, Tyrant! To give me Law. There are Degrees in Guilt; And I have still my Reason left, have left Some Resolution, some Remains of Virtue: Yes, I dare die; and who dares die, Egisthus, Ne'er need be driven to villainous Extremes! Mark me, insulting Man!âMy certain Cure Of every Woe, my cordial Draught is ready; And if you do not promise me, here swear, To drop your fell Designs on Agamemnon, To quit this PalaceâYou may still escapeâ And never see me more; I go, I go, This moment to discover all and die! Egisthus. What! Clytemnestra!â Clytemnestra. Nothing shall dissuade me. I will not argue moreâSay, only say, Must I betake me to this cruel Refuge? This dire Necessity? Egisthus. Permit me, Madam; Hear me but once, and then pursue your Purpose. Suppose us guilty, what you will;âyet, Madam, Shall we acknowledge and proclaim that Guilt? Shall we, by patient waiting for our Doom, By pitiful Neglect of Self-defence, Unheard of Meanness! stamp it into Shame? No; let us wipe it out with bold Success. It is Success that colours all in Life: Success makes Fools admir'd, makes Villains honest; All the proud Virtue of this vaunting World Fawns on Success, and Power, howe'er acquir'd. If then, supposing Guilt, it were a Meanness To stoop to Shame, can Words express the Madness Of stopping short, with Infamy and Ruin, When Justice Love and Vengeance urge to Glory? Instead of being deem'd a generous Queen, The brave Avenger of her Sex's Honour, Fam'd for her Spirit, for her just Resentment; Who greatly punish'd a perfidious Husband, A cruel Tyrant; one, who from his Bed, His Throne, propos'd, with open Shame, to turn her, And to her place to take his Country's Foe, To take a Trojan Captive, proud Cassandra: Instead of such Renown, can Clytemnestraâ Forgive the DoubtâCan she submit to pass, Thro' future Times, for an abandon'd Woman? A feeble, spiritless abandon'd Woman!â Nay, Madam, hear the Truth,âWhat now I tell you Must, in a little scanty Hour, take place; In a few Moments, you must be the first Or last of Women; be the publick Scorn, Or Admiration of approving Greeceâ You know you must;âbe Agamemnon's Slave, Cassandra's Slave, or nobly punish Both, And reign with me in Happiness and Glory. Consult your Heart; can you resolve on Shame? On voluntary Shame? That only Ill The Generous fear, which kills the Soul it self. Were these fair Features, full of lovely Grandeur, Form'd for Confusion? That majestic Front, To be bow'd down with Infamy and Vileness? Ah! can you bear Contempt? The venom'd Tongue Of those whom Ruin pleases? The keen Sneer, The lewd Reproaches of the rascal Herd; Who for the self-same Actions, if successful, Would be as grosly lavish in your Praise?â To sum up all in oneâcan you support The scornful Glances, the malignant Joy, Or more detested Pity of a Rival? Of a triumphant Rival?âNo; you cannot. That conscious Worth, which kindles in your Eye, Tells me you cannot.â But, in vain Disputes, No more to squander these important Moments; Know, that I have not, to the frail Decision Of wav'ring Fear and Female Weakness, left Our Freedom, Safety, Happiness and Honour. Even in your own Despight you shall be sav'd. And could you be so lost to Reason, wild, To do what Woman never did before, What shocks Humanity, accuse your self, You only court Dishonour to no purpose: For Agamemnon now cannot escape; I am already Master of this Palace; All is prepar'd, my People all are fix'd, All properly dispos'd; and here I swear, By sacred Justice, Glory, Love and Vengeance! He dies!âdies in the Bath, before the Banquet!â And with him dies Cassandra, she who durst, Even in presumptuous Thought, usurp thy Honours. She weeps!âO my ador'd! my Clytemnestra! Forgive this barbarous necessary Truth! Did I not love thee, love thee more than Empire, Than Life and Glory, would I thus disclose These dangerous Secrets? Could I not have veil'd, And, with more certain Caution gain'd my Purpose? Clytemnestra. Oh that you had, Egisthus! then, alas! I should have fondly thought my self less guilty Egisthus. I lose my self in Softness, while the Time, With Danger big, demands intrepid Deeds. Wipe off these TearsâWhen next we meet again, All will be well. SCENE II. Clytemnestra. Ah! when we meet again!â I stand, at last, convinc'd, and must dissembleâ Yet how dissemble? Painted, in my Face, Are the full Horrors of this bloody Deed.â But who are these approaching?-Ha!-Cassandra How fair she seems! how lovely!âhateful Charms! That well may rival mine, decay'd, and sunk, By Guilt and SorrowâShe possess my Bed! Possess my Scepter!âThis restores my Spirit;â I am abus'd! too patient!âPerish all! Perish my self, Egisthus, Agamemnon! So this proud Rival this Cassandra perish! SCENE III. Cassandra, Trojan Captives, Melisander. Melisander. Daughters of Ilium! By the King's Command, I come to ask your Presence at the Banquet. Till then allow me to partake your Woes: I have a Reverence for them. I my self, Thanks to the gracious Gods! have known misfortune; I am with Grief acquainted, therefore can For others feel. Sweet Source of every Virtue, O sacred Sorrow! He who knows not Thee, Knows not the best Emotions of the Heart, Those tender Tears that humanize the Soul, The Sigh that Charms, the Pang that gives Delight; He lives next door to Cruelty and Pride, And is a Novice in the School of Virtue. Cassandra. We thank thee, Stranger, for thy generous Pity. Heaven has, it seems, throughout diffus'd the Good. May the kind Gods, the Hospitable Powers, For this befriend thee! Thou must wander still, Wilt their Protection want.âBut Agamemnon, Where is the King? Melisander. He bathes him for the Banquet, The Banquet earn'd by ten Years War and Toil. Cassandra. Short-sighted Man! to dream of festal Joy, When his next Banquet is perhaps with Pluto. He comes! the God comes rushing on my Soul! O gently sooth me with the Voice of Musick! Assuage my Pangs with Harmony!âMethinks, I hear Apollo's Lyre. Melisander. Mysterious Powers! Casandra. 'Tis goneâAnd now harsh Discord takes its place: Dire Yellings now affright my trembling Ear. What means this Uproar of the howling Forrest? The Lioness and Wolf, together leagu'd, Pursue the Lion's Life.âBehold! the Snare, Th'infernal Snare is set, spread by the Stream, Where, unsuspecting Harm, he bathes at Noon. Soon will these guiltless Waters blush with Blood. Melisander. There is a sort of gloomy Light in This, That flashes Horror on me. Cassandra. A black Swarm Of fell Ideas seize my Fancy.âHence! O snatch me from this Palace! Shambles rather! It smells of Carnage; breathes an hideous Steam, As if from gaping Sepulchers exhal'd. And, lo! the spotless Loves, the Sports, the Joys, The weeping Lares fly: while, in their place, The Vices all, the raging Furies come; And with them Comus, the flush'd God of Banquets, Besmear'd with GoreâThey sing the funeral Hymnâ What do I see? what mean these mangled Forms? These pale, these nightly Phantoms; Such as rise, To working Fancy's Eye, in troubled Dreams?â See! where they sit for ever at the Gates, Demanding VengeanceâVengeance is at handâ Ha! 'tis the murder'd Boys, whose Limbs were, here, Serv'd up to their own Sire, to be devour'd!â Melisander. She wakes my DreadâThe Story of Thyestes!â Cassandra. With this devoted Race involv'd, I fall: Nor falls the Slave, aloneâthe Master falls. But Man shall die for Man, for Woman Woman: Remember This. Melisander. The Slave the Master fall! Cassandra. Ah Bosom-Traitress! Ill-persuaded Queen! And canst thou then the barbarous Secret keep?â Melisander. What Queen? what Secret? Speak more plain Cassandra! Cassandra. From Guilt, in vain, to greater Guilt you fly, From Crime to Crime precipitatedâNo! The wicked find no PeaceâDistraction waits Thee!â One Effort moreâYes, save thy Lord, and dieâ That Throw belong'd to VirtueâCannot then The gentle Powers prevail?âA Moment yet, The doubtful Ballance yet allows a Momentâ Down, down it goes, for Vengeance and for Troy! But ah! such Vengeance, as even Foes themselves Abhor to see! Melisander. She staggers all my Reason. Unveil these dreadful OraclesâPerhapsâ Cassandra. Yes, in a moment, they will be too plain. The Moment comes! The Furies lash it on! Ha! Now! Melisander. Unusual Horror creepsâ Cassandra. Alas! Keep from the murderous Sacrificer's Hand, O keep the Victim Bull! Lo! seiz'd, he spurns, He foams in vainâBehold the lifted Blow! Behold the thirsty Steel!âThey strike him!âHark! What Dismal Echoes run from Room to Room! Melisander. I heard a distant Noise!â [The Noise of Agamemnon's Assassination heard indistinctly, and at distance, behind the Scenes. Cassandra. Again!âThey strive, Th'Assassins labour who shall wound him most. 'Tis done!âHe fallsâ Agamemnon , behind the Scenes. [The Noise heard distinctly, and near. Off! Villains! Cowards! off!â By Villains murder'd!âOh!â Melisander. Great Gods! the King!â SCENE IV. Melisander, Cassandra, Trojan Captives, Electra, Orestes. Electra. Stop, generous Stranger! Agamemnon's Friend! Melisander. What would Electra? what with Melisander? Electra. Heavens! Melisander! Melisander. To the King's Assistance, I fly; detain me not. Electra. He is no more! Melisander. Ha! dead! Electra. Yes, murder'd by Egisthus! dead! Pierc'd with unnumber'd Wounds! O Horror! Horror! We have not time for GriefâOrestesâQuick! Fly! save my Brother! Orestes. Leave my Father!âNo! It is but once that I have ever seen him: Shall I no more? Electra. But to revenge his Death, O fly, Orestes, for that glorious Purpose! Tremendous Gods! Methinks, I see his Ghost, That beckons you away! Orestes. I come! I come! On Melisanderâ Electra. Brother! Orestes. Oh, my Sister! What will become of thee? Electra. Good Melisander, O guard my Brother! save our only Hope!â I heard a NoiseâFarewell!â Orestes , going. Ah! poor Electra! SCENE V. Electra, Cassandra, Trojan Captives. Electra. The Murderers come! stain'd with my Father's Blood! Hide me, Cassandra, hide me from a Sight I cannot bear, a Scene to Nature shocking! SCENE VI. The Back-Scene opening discovers, at a distance, Agamemnon's Body. Electra throws herself by it. Cassandra, Trojan Captives, Egisthus with some of his Party. Egisthus. Enough, my Friends!âHow low, how silent, now, The mighty Boaster lies!âAnother Blow Crowns my Revengeâ Cassandra. It shall not, base Assassin! The Gods are just; amidst the Crimes of Men, Are firmly just, supremely wise and good: The Gods are here, in all their Terrors present! See, where in dreadful Majesty they sit! And write thy Doom in Agamemnon's Blood! Egisthus. Think not to shake me with these gloomy Fables: This Arm that has acquir'd, shall guard my Power; And since I now enjoy my long-wish'd Vengeance, All here is calm and chearful. Cassandra. The false Boast Of agonizing Guilt! Thy Soul, I see, Beneath this harden'd Pride, this brutal Courage, Boils with black Torments, and with inward Tempest. I know whence breaks that Gleam of Joy athwart thee, As Lightning flashes o'er a troubled Sky: Thou dreamst the Prince now falls beneath thy Fury: But hear and trembleâyoung Orestes lives! Egisthus. Hence with thy vain Predictions, doating Woman!â SCENE VII. Egisthus, Cassandra, &amp;c. and to them Assassins sent to murder Orestes. Egisthus. Well, is Orestes dead? Assassin. Ah, Sir! escap'dâ When all was in Confusion, here, and Tumult. Egisthus. O nothing then is done!âFly! tardy Villains! Pursue him to the farthest Verge of Earth,â No dark Retreat, no Country.âBut here comes Another Storm. Distraction wings her Pace. SCENE VIII. Clytemnestra, Egistus, Cassandra, &amp;c. Clytemnestra. Off! give me way! to Desarts let me fly! The wildest Savage there!â Why pierce me thus with Looks?âIn every Eye There is a Dagger; chief in thine (to Egistus)âHa! Villain! I know Thee; know these Eyes, where smiling Love, To the red Glarings of a Fury's Torch, Is now transform'd.âYes, Traitor! turn away: But, ere you go, give me my Peace again; Give me my happy Family around; Give me my Virtue, Honour, nay my Glory; Or give me Death, tho' Death cannot relieve meâ Are these the Deeds of Love?âI cannot step, Unless I dip my shivering Feet in Blood. Compar'd with this polluted this dire Palace, The Sepulcher is gay.âBut whither fly?â Ah! what avails it where the Guilty fly, Since from themselves they cannot!âHa! Behold! The black Abyss discloses to my View; And down I go, a dark a deep Descent!â Hell from beneath is mov'd at my Approach: It's Princes flock around. Behold, they say, The greatly-wretched, greatly-wicked Woman! She who preferr'd the Villain to the Hero! The Trojan Shades, with sharp Derision, thank me: The Grecian droopâLo! where he comes himself! See! How in sullen Majesty he stalks!â Oh look not on me with that silent Scorn!â I am too curs'd already!â [Faints into the Arms of her Attendants. Egisthus. Bear her hence: And look she be attended well.âAt last, I shall o'er toiling Fate the Victory gainâ What new Alarm? SCENE IX. Egisthus, Cassandra, &amp;c. to them a Messenger. Messenger. As Melisander, Sir, Bore off Orestes, to th'assembled Senate He show'd the Prince, and rouz'd them to Revenge. 'Tis nought but Rage. The People, in a Torrent, By Arcas headed, pour upon the Palace. Besides, each moment, Agamemnon's Troopsâ Egisthus. Quick! summon here my FriendsâIn Io's Grove They ready wait. We this important Day Will or with Conquest crown, or bravely die. Cassandra. No, Tyrant, no! the Gods refuse thee That: Not like the Brave, but like the trembling Coward, Th'assassinating Coward, thou shalt die; There! in that Spot, where Agamemnon lies! Egisthus. Lead these ill-boding Women to their Fate; And guard Electra. Cassandra. The most grateful Gift A Tyrant can bestow is instant Death. We shall be happy soon. But all the Gods, Combining all their Mercy, from Remorse, From Scorn and Misery, cannot save the Villain. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Cibber. Our Bard, to Modern Epilogue a Foe, Thinks such mean Mirth but deadens generous Woe; Dispels in idle Air the Moral Sigh, And weeps the tender Tear from Pity's Eye: No more with social Warmth the Bosom burns; But all th'unfeeling, selfish Man returns. Another Epilogue was spoken after the first Representation of the Play, which began with the first six Lines of This: but the rest of that Epilogue, having been very justly disliked by the Audience, This was substituted in its Place. Thus he began:âAnd you approv'd the Strain; 'Till the next Couplet sunk to light and vain. You check'd him there.âTo You, to Reason just, He owns he triumph'd in your kind Disgust. Charm'd by your Frown, by your Displeasure grac'd, He hails the rising Virtue of your Taste. Wide will it's Influence spread, as soon as known: Truth, to be lov'd, needs only to be shown. Confirm it, once, the Fashion to be good: (Since Fashion leads the Fool, and awes the Rude) No Petulance shall wound the Publick Ear; No Hand applaud what Honour shuns to hear: No painful Blush the Modest Cheek shall stain; The worthy Breast shall heave with no disdain. Chastis'd to Decency, the British Stage Shall oft invite the Fair, invite the Sage: Both shall attend well-pleas'd, well-pleas'd depart; Or if they doom the Verse, absolve the Heart.</field>
