      <field name="fulltext">CAMILLA. AN OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable the LADY WHARTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Whilst Martial Troops, with more than Martial Rage, For Austria these, for Bourbon those engage, Cover with Blood th'unhappy Latian Plains, Insult their Shepherds, and oppress their Swains, Camilla frighten'd from her Native Seat, Hither is driv'n to beg a safe Retreat. O! may the exil'd Nymph a Refuge find, Such as may ease the Labours of her Mind. Hear her, ye Fair, in tuneful Notes complain; Pity her Anguish, and remove her Pain. To you her Vindication does belong, To you the Mourner has address'd her Song: Let her your Hearts with just Compassion move, By Musick soften'd, and endear'd by Love. So may your Warrior Lords successful fight, May Honour crown the Day, and Love the Night; May Conquest still attend their gen'rous Arms, 'Till their Swords grow as fatal as your Charms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, Written by Mr. Estcourt. Spoken by Mrs. Oldfeild. Our Neighbours lately, with an Ill Design, Strove the Contending Play-Houses to Join; But, bless'd with greater Charity than they, For the Prosperity of Both, we pray. Our Prince, not envious of his Rival's Throne, Lives like First Monarchs, happy with his own. Too kind to wish his Enemies should yield; He left 'em free,âNew Theatres to Build. And see what Fruits from Our Divisions spring, Both Houses now Italian Musick Sing. The Fair can only tell which pleases best; For Ladies always have the nicest Taste. But this We know, had that dire Union been, You ne'er in England had Camilla seen. They wou'd some Masque have shewn, or Country Farce; Paris's Judgment, or the Loves of Mars: But since the Stage's Freedom you Restore, And we no more dread Arbitrary Pow'r, To please this Audience, we'll no Charges spare, But chearfully maintain a vig'rous War. New Funds we'll raise, and heavy Taxes lay, Dancers and Singers (Dear Allies) to pay. Acting shall Shine, and Poetry Revive, And Emulation make our Empire Thrive. In ev'ry Play you see, or Song you hear, Pleasure, and Life, and Freedom shall appear. Our Stage is thus an Emblem of the State, With Mildness Rul'd, by Opposition Great. Abroad we Conquer our insulting Foes, And Universal Monarchy Oppose: Yet feel the Blessings of a Peaceful Reign, And safe at Home, our Liberties Maintain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons Represented. MEN. Latinus King of Latium, and of the Volscians. Prenesto, Son of Latinus. Mr. Holcomb. Turnus, or Armidoro, King of the Rutilians. Mr. Hughs. Metius, a Volscian Knight, and Captain of Latinus his Guards. Mr. Ramondon. Linco, a Country-Man of Volscia. Mr. Leveridge. WOMEN. Camilla, suppos'd a Shepherd's Neice, but Queen of the Volscians.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, a Champian Country with Plains and easie Hills, the End of a Wood on one Side, and Prospect of a City at Distance. Enter Camilla and Linco. Cam. These fruitful Fields, These Plains so sweet, These Walls, are the fair Volscian Seat. To view my Loss fresh Torture yields, And melts my weeping Eyes. Linc. Metabo, your Royal Father, now at Rest, Flew from Latino's Arms, by Fate opprest: The dear Companion of his Flight was you, The Wrongs you suffer'd much too young to know. Cam. And my poor Mother! Linc. Nature's boasted Pride; The Hour she gave you to the World, she dy'd. Cam. Forlorn Camilla! Fate has done its worst: I was born of Royal Race, Yet must wander in Disgrace; All the Pomp that Fortune yields, Humble Vallies, Flocks and Fields. SCENE II. A Company of Huntsmen, Prenesto and Metius behind the Scenes. Cam. Hark! Linco! a Voice. Hunts. See, see, a-cross the Plain, That Stag how swift he bounds? Met. Let slip the Hounds. Hunts. 'Twill be in vain, the Game's quite out of View, They'll not the Track pursue. Linc. They're Huntsmen at the Chace. Cam. O remember, Linco, pray! So may the Gods still prosper thee, Discover not thy self, nor me. Linc. Yes, I remember, I'll ne'er the Secret betray. I've got my Part Already by heart; And know what to reply: You are my Neice, your Uncle I. Cam. That Dorinda's my Name. Linc. Well, I know't, I'll take care. Cam. And my Life scarce of lateâ Linc. You need not repeat. Pren. Help me! oh help me! [A wild Boar struck by Prenesto. Hunts. Let's try to assist him. Linc. Ye Gods, what Alarm! Hunts. Quick run to his Aid. Enter Prenesto: The Boar pursuing him. Pren. O Heav'ns! who defends me? Cam. My Arm. [She throws a Dart, and kills the Boar. Linc. Dorinda, of nothing afraid, She's sprightly and gay, a valiant Maid, And as bright as the Day. Cam. Take Courage, Hunter, the Savage is dead. Pren. O Nymph of Race Divine! That do'st all Nymphs outshine; Such Glories fill thy Eyes: My ravish'd Soul surprizing, That PhÅbus at his rising Less charming paints the Skies. Cam. Ha! no, I'm Fortune's Scorn, A Maid in much Distress, Tho' now, by chance, I've born The Praise of this Success. Linc. And know she's Linco's Neice. SCENE III. Enter Metius. Met. My Lord, to your Relief Metius ran swift thro' the Field, But came too late, Because from far I did your Danger view. Pren. See here my broken Spear, I struck the Beast, and part remains Fix'd in his Side; Enrag'd, on me he flew, while I for Succour cry'd; This Goddess of the Plains A lucky Jav'lin threw; She pierc'd the Monster with her Dart, And with her Eyes my Heart; Thus sav'd by her, by her I die. Met. I with Joy your Safety see; Bright Goddess, on thee Heav'n this Fame bestows, To thee his Life Prenesto owes, The great Latinus Son. Cam. Latinus Son. Met. 'Tis he. Cam. What have I done! [Aside. See, Linco, see! While I entreat the Skies T'avenge my Wrongs, I'm doom'd to save my Enemies. Pren. What says the lovely Charmer! Cam. I said that the propitious Skies Smile on this happy Hour; For from Latinus Grace and Pow'r Justice I would implore. Let me at his Feet make known, The Weight of Woe that sinks me down. Linc. O dear, dissembling Woman! Pren. Come to the Court, your Wish obtain; Mean while remain Conqueress of a double Prize, Of the living and the slain, One by this Spear, one by your Eyes. Since you from Death have sav'd me, I'll live for you alone; The Life you freely gave me, That Life's not now my own. [Exit. Met. Huntress, look not to find [To Camilla. Within these Woods alive More of the Savage Kind; They've seen that honour'd Beast A glorious Death receive, and Envy slew the rest. If then you seek more Prize, Throw your useless Spear away: The Light'ning from your Look that flies, More than a thousand Spears can slay. Love's Darts are in your Eye, There dwells the smiling Ruin; Your Brows his Bow supply, To shoot us while we're viewing. Who can the Sight refrain? Who bear a Joy so Thrilling? So wond'rous sweet's the Pain, The Pleasure is so killing! [Exit. Linc. Camilla, this is Metius, a Volscian Knight, For Valour much renown'd; In Peace he was approv'd, in War he was belov'd, And ever Loyal found. Him have I often heard your Royal Sire commend; He serv'd him as his Prince, and lov'd him as his Friend. Tho' fourteen Years are past Since I beheld him last, Both the Voice and the Mein, Of him I've often seen, Assure me I am right. Cam. My Fears are dying, And my Sorrows all are flying. Fortune hitherto severe Begins her angry Brow to clear. Be kind, ye Gods! Assert, assert my Cause, Protect my Innocence, and Defend your Laws, Fortune, ever known to vary, Now grown weary, Changes to a Smile her Frown. Joys unknown are near attending, Never ending; Happy Hours move gaily on. [Exit. SCENE IV. A Chamber in the Royal Palace. Enter Lavinia; and after Tullia, and Turnus disguis'd like a Blackamoor. Lav. Tender Maids your Pity show, Th'envenom'd Dart I feel, Yet the Hand that gave the Blow, The Eyes that wound me so, No Virgin must reveal. Tul. Turnus, or rather Armidoro, the black Slave, Waiting without does for Admittance crave. Lav. Let him appear in whom my Thoughts delight, Whilst he is here, 'tis Day; when he is gone, 'tis Night. Turn. Lavinia, under this dark Disguise, A Soul unspotted, Faith unconquer'd lyes. Lav. That Lustre lyes in Clouds conceal'd by tender Art, Which else would blast a Virgin's Eyes, and scorch her Heart. Tul. The Art of Lovers none but Lovers know, They make White Black, and Black they turn to Snow. Turn. and Lav. together. One Day Cupid wantonly Let a pointed Arrow fly, Made me languish, pine and die. SCENE V. Enter Latinus and the rest. Tul. Behold, Latinus! Lat. Daughter! Lav. My Royal Father! Lat. Fame of Beauty, Love of Power, Draws from many a distant Shore Crouds that do your Charms adore. To such a Prince I wish you join'd, Whose faithful Arms with mine combin'd, May pull th'imperious Turnus down, And seize on the Rutilian Crown. Turn. Turnus thy fruitless Wishes hears, Committing to the Wind his Fears. [Aside. Lat. Do thou make prudent Choice of one, Worthy thy Love, and my Renown. Lav. Sir, some small Time for Thought allow, E'er that Choice I do avow. Turn. Unconstant Mind! Lat. You nought require But what is just; think, and be happy. [Exit. Turn. Where is thy Faith, Lavinia, now? Lav. Turnus! Turn. Some Time for Thought allow, E'er that Choice I do avow. Ungrateful! Lav. You wrong your Love, and your Lavinia. Turn. Witness this abhorr'd Disguise; Like Jove, I quit my Royal Seat, For Love my Majesty forget. The fam'd Rutilian King I am no more; Turnus is lost in Armidore, And this is my Reward. Lav. Think, if openly I seem'd to yield, Latinus is my Father, I his Child. Much is to a Father due, More I own to Love and you. Turn. Frail are a Lover's Hopes, And fatal is the Fair; If she smiles, 'tis to destroy, Vain his Hopes are, false the Joy That doth his Heart ensnare. [Exit. SCENE VI. Lavinia and Tullia. Lav. Are then these frequent Sighs and Tears, My Heart that swells with Hopes and Fears, Are these the Servants of Deceit? Wretched Lavinia! cruel Fate! Tul. Madam, your fruitless Tears give over, Nor mourn for an unworthy Lover. Lav. Welcome Sorrow, Death attending, Welcome Death, my Sorrows ending. When our Joys uneasie are, Hope despairing, Joys impairing, Life becomes below our Care. Welcome Death, my Sorrows ending, Welcome Sorrow, Death attending. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. The Palace. Enter Metius, Linco, and Camilla. Met. Art thou the Swain that did resort, In former Times, unto the Volscian Court? Linc. Sir, I am. Met. And Dorindaâ Linc. And Dorindaâ Cam. What of Dorinda thou desir'st to hear, Let the poor Shepherdess her self declare. Great Metabo thou once didst serve. Met. With an approv'd Fidelity. Cam. Should he return th'Imperial Reins to hold. Met. With Joy the People would behold Their lawful Lord, With Joy receive Great Metabo restor'd. Cam. Should he be no more. Met. The Royal Exile bury'd on some Foreign Shore, I would for ever mourn. Cam. But should Camilla once return, Might she of thy Faith be sure? Met. To restore her to her own, And place her on her Father's Throne, All I gladly would endure. Cam. Metius, great Metabo is dead, but see His wretched Daughter still survive in me. Met. Art thou Camilla? Cam. Yes, and thy Promise claim. Met. All I'll venture to restore ye, Injur'd Princess, to your Right: If my Sword too weak should prove, I swear by Empire, and by Love, By those Pow'rs that now smile o'er ye, With your pointed Fyes I'll Fight. All I'll venture, &amp;c. Cam. See the just Gods of Innocence Regard, with tender Eyes, The Sorrows I endure. Pow'rs unseen are arm'd to rise, United all in my Defence, They drive Despair far off from hence, And work my Sorrows Cure. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. A Palace. Enter Latinus, Prenesto and Lavinia. Lat. Did then a Shepherdess preserve my Son? Pren. Sir, to a gen'rous Shepherdess my Life I owe. Lav. The Name of thy Protectress tell. Pren. Dorinda. Lav. Say, where does Dorinda dwell? Pren. Without she waits, and has a Boon to crave, More worthy than the Life she give. Lat. Let the lov'd Nymph appear. SCENE IX. Enter Metius, Camilla and Linco. Met. Behold her here, to whom we owe Our present Joys, and future Blessings too. Lav. Behold her here, whose bold courageous Hand Did the fatal Stroke withstand. Pren. Behold her here, who, in the fatal Field, Was the forlorn Prenesto's Shield. Cam. The Good I did to Chance is due; No Merit can Dorinda claim: Chance did this Desert bestow, That I thus prostrate at your Feet, Might a kind Acceptance meet, And my Request obtain. Lat. Rise, and thy Request explain. Cam. Poor and distress'd tho' now I seem, My Father, near Sebeto's Stream, Did sometimes large Possessions claim; 'Till an Usurper, arm'd with Pow'r, Arriv'd in an unhappy Hour, Seiz'd on our Flocks, my Father slew, Did me with equal Rage pursue; And now an Exile must I die, If your Assistance you deny. Lat. Metius, with a chosen Band Of Volscians, waiting your Command, Shall march this Hour to your Relief, And punish the injurious Thief. Met. With Joy the Soldier moves to Fight, When Beauty gives the Word; Beauty ever in the right, Draws the Bow, and weilds the Sword. Lav. Fair Dorinda, happy, happy, Happy may'st thou ever be: The Stars that smile on happy Days, May they all now smile on thee. [Exeunt all but Prenesto, Camilla and Linco. SCENE X. Pren. Dorinda, ah! could you my Heart discover, You there would find a soft and tender Lover. Cam. A Prince's Favour surely is Divine, Nor should it, like the Sun, on Wretches shine. Pren. A Prince's Love, like second Fate, Doth a low Object new create. Cam. But when he makes unequal Choice, He stands condemn'd by publick Voice. SCENE XI. Enter Tullia. Tul. Fair Nymph, Lavinia calls thee. Cam. I am Lavinia's Slave. Pren. Stay, fair Dorinda; What would my Sister have? Linc. to Tul. Fair, I love thee. Tul. He is a handsome Swain. Pren. Dorinda, for Love of thee I burn, I die! Cam. Such Beauty pleases, tho' in an Enemy. [Aside. Linc. Who art thou? Tul. Tullia, a Lady of the Court. Linc. And I Dorinda's Uncle. Tul. Thank Heav'n for't. Pren. Charming Fair, for thee I languish! But bless the Hand That gave the Blow. With equal Anguish Each Swain despairs, And when she appears Streams forget to flow. Cam. (Aside) Wretched Camilla! a double Slave thou art, He who expects thy Crown, now claims thy Heart. Wretched am I that I gain him, And I gladly would disdain him, Whom my Eyes have made my Slave: But in vain do I endeavour; Fate resisting, Love persisting, Unconquer'd ever, Me an equal Vassal have. [Exeunt Pren. and Cam. SCENE XII. Manet Tullia and Linco. Tul. Pretty is this Neice of thine; How doth she to Love incline? Linc. For Love she is too young. Tul. And yet I sawâbut hush, my Tongue. Linc. Spare your Reflections; she is right, And can't distinguish Black from White. Tul. They are Fools, that can rely Upon a formal Cast o'th'Eye. Among Women, they for certain Know the most, that least discover, To the Husband, or the Lover, Whom they study to betray. See her to th'Appointment hasting, Her Steps precise, her Looks upcasting; But could you the Fair disclose behind the Curtain, You'd quickly hear her burst out into an Ah! Linc. Dorinda knows not, on my Life, What Husband-means, what's meant by Wife. Tul. Small Learning will suffice t'explain, To willing Minds, what those Words mean. Linc. The Meaning then is known to you? Tul. The Theory yes, the Practick no. Linc. An untouch'd Virgin you appear. Tul. I dar'd not wed too soon. Linc. What Thoughts of Wedlock now d'you bear? Tul. To wed whilst I am in my Noon. Linc. Thy Noon is Night. [Aside. Tul. A well-built Wight. [Aside. Linc. A wanton Witch. Tul. A Tongue so sweet. Linc. Yet if she's rich I'll languish at her Feet. Aged Phillis Wanton still is, Paying now for those dear Pleasures, Which before improv'd her Treasures, When her Youth was in the Bloom. Gold supplies what Age is wasting, Gold has Beauties ever lasting, Gold gives Brav'ry to the Coward, Gives good Humour to the Froward, Gold gives Honour to the Clown. Tul. Linco. Linc. See how her Chaps water. Tul. I find I please. Linc. And I'll be at her. Like my Brother Beaux o'th'Town, I'll Love pretend, where there is none. For thee I burn, my pretty Dame, Be complaisant, and quench my Flame: O how much I long t'enfold thee, And in Hymen's Bands to hold thee. Tul. My House's Honour would miscarry, Should I to a Peasant marry. Linc. O Heav'ns! Tul. Indeed I own that I adore him, But must not yield yet for decorum. I languish! Linc. For whom? Tul. I sorrow! Linc. My Dear. Tul. My Treasure! Linc. I'm here. Tul. I speak not to thee. Me would'st thou? Linc. Thee, thee! Tul. O help me! Linc. Here, here! Tul. Thus pensive I go, And utter my Woe. [Exeunt. SCENE XIII. Enter Turnus and Lavinia. Turn. Unfaithful, let me go! Lav. Whither? Turn. Where Those false deluding Accents I no more may hear. Latinus' Menaces too well I heard; Too well I know what Troops by Metius are prepar'd. Lav. T'assist Dorinda are those Troops design'd. Turn. Lavinia with Latinus too was join'd. Latinus with his numerous Arms, His Daughter with more pow'rful Charms, For my Destruction both alike prepare, And Love more fatal is than War. Lav. Can'st thou forget me? Turn. No, I find Love unresisted rules my Mind, The wonted Greatness of my Soul is gone: Latinus dies, so shall his hated Son. Lav. And Laviniaâ Turn. O I live in her. Lav. And yet your warlike Squadrons to prepare You go. Turn. I go. Lav. And those against Latinus you will lead? Turn. Yes. Lav. Latinus is my Father; when he's deadâ But see him here. SCENE XIV. Enter Latinus. Lat. Lavinia, hast thou chosen? Turn. What do I hear? Lav. I've chosen one Worthy your Daughter, and your Throne. Lat. O name him to me, that I may Bless thee, and this auspicious Day. Lav. You wish'd for Turnus fetter'd to your Throne; Turnus is worthy, and must be your Son. Lat. Turnus wilt thou wed? Turn. What have I done? Lav. In vain we labour to recede From what by Fate has been decreed. Lat. Fate with free Will has bless'd Mankind. Lav. To Love that Freedom I've resign'd. Lat. Let her that dares thus insolent rebel, Let her in close Confinement dwell; Let none Admittance to her have, But Armidore, the faithful Slave. If thy fond Wishes still to Turnus cleave, From Death alone expect a late Reprieve. [Exit. SCENE XV. Manent Turnus and Lavinia Turn. Pardon, Lavinia, my too jealous Fears. Lav. Unfaithful sure Lavinia still appears. Turn. See, I repent. Lav. Be gone, and leave the Maid By whom the Royal Turnus is betray'd. Turn. Forbear tormenting thy unhappy Guest, By his own Guilt too much oppress'd. Lav. To thee I swear, and to just Heav'n, Rather than violate my Faith once giv'n, I will unmov'd to Death withstand My angry Father's hard Command; And when I am dead, Let this upon my Urn be read, Here lyes Lavinia, Who to preserve unmov'd her Faith, Chearfully resign'd to Death. Turn. Ah! never yet was known A Nymph so kind and true, So fair and faithful too. Despair no more pursues me. My fancy'd Fears are flown, My Thoughts no Joy refuse me, My Torments adieu. A Dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE, A Gallery. Enter Camilla, Tullia and Linco. Tul. Here let your Eyes with Pleasure Survey this Royal Treasure, Which if we may compare, The Court can boast of nothing half so rich and fair. Linc. Where-e'er we turn our Eyes Fresh Wonders gaily rise. Cam. United Arts in ev'ry Object shine, Mortal the Workman is, the Workman's Art Divine. Tul. All these by Metabo were once possess'd. Cam. By Metabo? Tul. What Passions fill thy Breast? Cam. With Wonder and Disdain at once my Heart's opprest. Tul. Behold these Royal Statues: These The Care of Metabo, those of Latinus are: Here Casimilla lyes in graceful Pride, Who on the Day she bore Camilla dy'd. Here Metabo her Royal Consort flies, Camilla in his Arms, and Sorrow in his Eyes. Cam. O miserable King! unhappy Queen! Linc. Your ill-tim'd Sorrow will be seen. Cam. Unhappy Child! Linc. Your Reason is asleep. Tul. Why does Dorinda weep? Why flow those Eyes? Cam. Because Camilla's Fate and mine do simpathize. Again, again past Wrongs I feel, The pointed Javelin and the Steel. My injur'd Soul will know no Rest, Furies will haunt my troubled Breast, 'Till he dies A Sacrifice, By whom our Royal House has been opprest. Let him die, ye Pow'rs! strike him dead! Dart all your Light'ning at his devoted Head. Tear him, ye Furies! tear him! May the Furies alarm him! May his Conscience disarm him! But I'm unwise. O Gods! Camilla's Fate and mine do simpathize! Linc. Give your Sorrows over! Tul. Dorinda, be at Peace. Cam. How! give my Sorrows over! A Grief like mine admits of no Release. Linc. These publick Tears for Shame keep in. Cam. Tullia; look, behold! Tul. What is there to be seen? Cam. Behold Camilla's Shade appears! See what Disdain her angry Visage wears! Behold! Tul. I nothing seeâ Cam. Before thee, see her stand. Tul. Sure she is mad; where should Camilla be? Cam. I rave, I rave! or else I sleep: But no, See there's Camilla full of Woe! Behold Camilla near, Camilla's weeping Accent hear. Tul. What doth she say? Cam. Camilla, lo I am. I am Camilla, and swear, by all my Woes, His guilty Days shall know no Rest, His restless Nights know no Repose: Day and Night shall near him dwell Those Horrors all Usurpers feel! 'Till oppress'd by his Grief, And encumber'd with Care, Depriv'd of Relief, He flies to the Grave in Despair. Linc. Metius must be hither brought, To cure those Ills her Grief has wrought. [Exit. Tul. Do dwell with Madmen sure None but Madmen can endure. [Exit. Cam. Linco; Linco and Tullia both are gone! And Camilla, left alone, Safely may her Thoughts unveil, The Gods are just, and nothing will reveal. Sorrow join'd with Sorrow, Grief with Grief combin'd, Distract my Breast, Deny me Rest, And raise Convulsions in my Mind. I weep! and I rave! And my Wrongs aloud for Vengeance crave! Revenge! Revenge! I summon! Revenge is all my Care; Revenge! I summon; yet no. SCENE II. Enter Prenesto. Pren. Dorinda, hear a faithful Lover. Cam. What would Prenesto say? Pren. In vain I fly from Sorrows, That still attend me; In Grief your Youth is wasted, By Grief my Hopes are blasted. Those Tears thus daily flowing, That Breast with Sighs still glowing, Will quickly end me. Cam. Prenesto! how can I that Joy bestow, Which I my self must never know? Pren. With your Grief I simpathize, But read Aversion in your Eyes. Cam. You wrong your own, accusing mine, My tender Thoughts with Pity move. Pren. And yet ungrateful, you decline To ease my Heart, and crown my Love. Cam. Upbraid no more, Prenesto, My Virgin Passion; With you I pine and languish, I feel your Grief and Anguish, But Fate is unrelenting, And Fear is still preventing My Inclination. [Exit. SCENE III. Prenesto, Metius and Linco. Pren. Bright PhÅbus Rays, that warm the Skies, Are not so killing as her Eyes: That Heav'nly Grace, and comely Pride, Are not to her low Birth allay'd. Enter Linco and Metius. Linc. My Lord, I now perceive she's gone, Tho' late I left her here alone. Pren. The Nymph you want this Instant did depart, With a distracted Look, and broken Heart. Metius, with speed for her Relief prepare; And may Success attend your pious Care. Met. My Lord, the Troops are not yet justly form'd With which this Service is to be perform'd, But with such Expedition will I move; The same Express that tells ye I am gone, Shall tell ye that the Work is done. Pren. To Beauty devoted, Expecting, desiring, With Passion expiring, I serve the blind Boy. Yet ever contented, So easie the Chain is, So pleasing the Pain is, I serve him with Joy. [Exit. SCENE IV. Manent Linco and Metius. Linc. I hope Prenesto's seasonable Love, In time will useful to Camilla prove. Met. Linco! Linc. My Lord. Met. Do thou to fair Camilla haste, And bid her, e'er an Hour be past, To that Part of the City go, Where Amaseno's Waters flow. Linc. To my Mistress lo I fly, And will a Fool, or wise Man be, As with the Times shall best agree. [Exit. Met. I love, but dare not My Flame discover, Lest I displease her. When I assure her how much I love her. Thus must I suffer Without a Cure, Nor can I tell her What I endure. [Exit. SCENE V. Latinus, Turnus and Prenesto. Lat. Doth she continue still unmov'd? Turn. Turnus, she saith, must ever be belov'd. Pren. Unwise Lavinia! Turn. Constant Fair! Lat. What doth she talk on? let me know. Turn. In Turnus' Praise her Tongue doth daily flow, And often when to Armidore she speaks Her Tongue mistakes, And calls me Turnus. Lat. This is the highest Disobedience, And Death shall punish the Offence. Pren. Let your Resentments to soft Pity yield. Turn. Remember, Sir, Lavinia is your Child. Lat. An impious Justice will I do. Here, Armidoro. Turn. Ye cruel Gods, what now! Pren. O Father, cruel! and O King, unjust! Lat. Haste to Lavinia, and discharge thy Trust. Or Turnus let her strait forsake, Or in this Cup her Passion slake. If she prove disobedient to my Will, Do thou the proud Imperial Rebel kill. [Exit. SCENE VI. Manet Turnus. Turn. Kill my Lavinia, did Latinus say? No Tyrant, Turnus never will obey. I might convey her far from hence; To that her Honour will not yield. Shall I arm in her Defence, And cover with my Troops the Field? To Tyrant Rage she'd then be left: And when she is of Life bereft, My fruitless Vengeance can't restore her. Now, Cupid, or never, Be kind and discover What Turnus must do. When Danger's appearing, And kind Fortune veering, Our Thoughts are but slow. Now, Cupid, or never, &amp;c. [Exit. SCENE VII. Enter Linco in a Gentleman's Dress, follow'd by Tullia. Linc. Fortune, like a wanton Gipsie, Often turns Things upside down, When she's grown a little tipsie, In a Trice, Sir, She will give a sudden Rise, Sir, To a Justice from a Clown. The Reason why Must ne'er be known. Enter Tullia. Tul. Linco, is it thee alone? Linc. Let Freedom less, and more Respect be shown. Tul. I find the Proverb verify'd, Set a Beggar on Horseback, and he'll ride. Linc. My Neice Dorinda, you have heard, A Gentlewoman is declar'd; And 'tis but Reason good that I Should State assume accordingly. Tul. Illustrious Linco, let us nowâ Linc. What? Tul. That I'm not marry'd yet, you know. Linc. What then? Tul. I have enough exprest, Spare my Shame, and guess the rest. Linc. I cannot guess, I'm such a Dunce; Take Heart, and out with't all at once. Tul. Then to make plain the Matter, I Thy wedded Wife would gladly be. Linc. Too high for Linco you were late, 'Tis my turn now, and I take State. For I rememberâ. Tul. What dost thou remember? Linc. Thus pensive I go, And utter my Woe. Tul. Not so much Cruelty, I prithee now, my Linco, I do conjure thee. I long to be thy Bride. All Day I long to eye thee, All Night I could lye by thee, I do assure thee. [Exeunt SCENE VIII. An Apartment of Lavinia, a Chair on one Side. Enter Lavinia. Lav. No Love was ever known that mine surmounted, No Faith was ever shown, my Faith exceeding. Wherefore, of constant Love, I shall b'accounted The most exalted Proof, in Times succeeding. Thou God of Sleep, beguile My Miseries a while That with fresh Vigour I may bear Whate'er the cruel Fates prepare. [Sleeps. SCENE IX. Enter Turnus. Turn. See where secure she lyes asleep, Whilst Fear and Jealousie at Distance keep. From Death's soft Image rise, my Fair, And for Death it self prepare. Lav. Who robs me of that golden Rest, With which my weary'd Thoughts were blest? Turn. See him, who lives alone in thee, Unkindly wakes and summons thee to die. Lav. To die! Turn. Your cruel Father has decreed, His Daughter by this Hand must bleed. Lav. Welcome my Death from any Hand would be, But doubly welcome, when it comes from thee. Strike, and my Father's Will obey. Turn. In wounding thee, I shall my self destroy. Lav. Art thou not Turnus? Turn. Thou know'st I am. Lav. Be like thy self then, truly brave, And scorn the Weakness of a Slave. Strike deep, and let the Crimson Flood My Faith inviolate make good. Turn. Thy precious Life for-ever I'll protect, And at thy Father's Breast this Steel direct. SCENE X. Enter Latinus. Lat. Desponding Slave! why this Delay: Haste, and my just Commands obey. Lav. Dread Sir, Lavinia does not beg to live, But that your Pardon you would kindly give, If your unhappy Daughter Death should chuse, Rather than violate her Virgin Vows. Lat. Die then forgotten and abhorr'd. Lav. My Breast is open; strike, my Lord. Turn. I'll perish rather! Lat. Most audacious Slave! Dar'st thou an angry Monarch's Fury brave? Turn. I scorn the Task to which I am assign'd; I wear a Monarch's Soul and Lover's Mind. In me see Turnus. Lat. Thou Poison to my Eyes! Turnus art thou, and in a Slave's Disguise? My Daughter's Honour thou hast stain'd, For which thy Life shall pay. Turn. I swear by Empire, and by Love I swear, Her Honour's bright as is the Morning Star. Henceforth let Enmity and Discord cease, And let Lavinia be the Pledge of Peace. Lat. Anger to Friendship does give way, Like Night that shes approaching Day. Lav. Joys are attending, Those Cares are ending That did distress me. Love reconciling, And Fortune smiling, Unite to bless me. Turn. Around her see Cupid flying, Behold him wishing, dying; Such Graces shine all o'er her, Gods might adore her. Blind Boy, forbear to woe her, Thy Flame admits no Cure! To me, in sight of Heav'n, Her Faith is giv'n. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. A Wood. Enter Metius, Camilla, and the People. Met. Behold Camilla, the great Volscian Queen, An Exile long th'unhappy Fair has been; At length she comes in a propitious Hour, To free her Subjects from a lawless Pow'r. Cam. Behold Camilla, who was born your Queen: Ye wretched Volscians, with Regret I've seen The Royal Throne by proud Oppression stain'd, Where Metabo with so much Mildness reign'd. For your sakes, not my own, I'm come To drive th'Usurper far away, And rule ye with a lawful Sway, As Children dear ye are to me. Met. Prenesto comes! People. Then let him die. SCENE XII. Enter Prenesto. Cam. Forbear. Met. With calmer Thoughts you must proceed. Pren. Yes, let him die; let the Oppressor bleed That wrong'd Dorinda. Ye martial Spirits, draw, And let the Will of Metius be your Law. So brave a Gen'ral in a Cause so right, Ev'n now you triumph e'er you move to fight. Met. Love leads to Battel, Who dares oppose him? The Rebel Squadrons his Presence fly; See how the Heroe Drives all before him, Arm'd with Light'ning shot from her Eye. [Exeunt Metius and the People. SCENE XIII. Manent Prenesto and Camilla. Cam. Hope would my fond Heart ensnare. But Oh! Pren. But what? Cam. My Soul is all Despair; Close in my Bosom let it sleep. Pren. Thy secret Grief unfold. Cam. Conceal'd my Thoughts I ought to keep. Pren. To me they may be told. Cam. 'Tis Love. Pren. Of whom? Were I the happy Swain! Cam. My Tyrant's Son is Author of my Pain. Pren. Preposterous Passion! I condemn thy Love To him, who should thy Indignation move. Cam. Love is Almighty, and controls the Heart: Thy Sire my Tyrant, thou my Idol art. [Aside. SCENE XIV. Enter Linco. Linc. Young Prince, Latinus doth your Presence crave: In Armidoro, the Morisco Slave, Turnus is found, who safe in that Disguise Has paid his Vows to Fair Lavinia's Eyes. Pren. What's that I hear? Cam. Surprising News! Pren. My Father to attend I go, And wish you'd cease to love your Foe. Ungrateful you fly me, Unkindly deny me. Tho' Passion so tender Sure never was born. You fly your Pursuer, You court your Undoer, And tamely surrender To one you should scorn. [Exit. SCENE XV. Manent Camilla and Linco. Linc. Turnus is the Rutilian King; To him if you your Grief disclose, He might his kind Assistance bring, And loving you dethrone your Foes. Cam. Thou know'st his Vows are to Lavinia paid Linc. With you the Volscian Kingdom he will get, The Charms of Love to Empire may submit. Cam. Love and Ambition strive Which shall the Conquest gain; 'Tis sweet in Love to thrive, And pleasant 'tis to reign. Both Champions are courageous, And equal is the Scale; I feel 'em both outrageous, Nor know which will prevail. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Manet Linco. Linc. Love hath a Character not half so bad As he deserves; he makes Folks mad. Enter Tullia. Tul. Behold your Vassal low, Does to your Footstool bow. Linc. For constant Proof of what I say, In her the past Age present see: A few kind Words, a wanton Smile, Shall the amorous Crone beguile. Tullia, forgive all past Offences. Tul. Joy has depriv'd me of my Senses. Linc. Thoughts interposing made my Tongue Utter what did not to my Heart belong. Tul. I would not change my present Fate, To be first Minister of State. I do invite thee as my Guest, To share in the approaching Feast, Which great Latinus doth provide, For Turnus and his Royal Bride. Linc. I will go with thee. Tul. I must know On what thou dost contemplate so. Linc. I'm charm'd with thy Court-like Address. Tul. See how he eyes me! Linc. Thy Beauty pleases to Excess: It doth surprize me. Tullia, I feel thy Charms begin to move me; Say, in pity, can you love me? You fill, with balmy Sweets, the ambient Air. O! would a gentle Smile but once relieve me, No Passion would with mine compare; You'd yield to Love, and Love would ne'er deceive ye. Tul. I thought, when first he seem'd so nice, He would in time reward my Pain. In Love-Affairs I'm still so wise, That first, or last, I'm sure to gain. Something is in my Face so alluring, Such Graces procuring, That no Beauty more is. Young Men, and Old, alike do desire me; Alike they do Fire me, With passionate Stories. They Sing, and they Caper, they Dress, and look Fine: In hopes that Fair Tullia will one Day incline: But Fair One, endeavour To live honest ever, Whate'er they design. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Enter Turnus and Camilla, and after Lavinia. Turn. When Love to Constancy is join'd, What unknown Raptures fill the Mind! Cam. Great Sir! Turn. Come near. Cam. Your Slave vouchsafe to hear. Turn. Turnus was never deaf to a Virgin's Pray'r. Cam. I am th'Unhappy Shepherdess. Turn. I've lately heard of thy Distress. Thy Valour too I've heard proclaim'd; Whilst this my Wonder, that my Pity claim'd How gracefully she moves! Cam. I sue to Thee. The Gods reject not a poor Suppliant's Knee: And the Sun-Beams with equal Lustre shine, As well upon the Thistle as the Vine. Turn. She of no Mortal Race appears, A Heav'nly Form her Visage wears. Nymph, I adore ye! [Enter Lavinia. Lav. Ungrateful! Turn. Such Heav'nly Beautyâ Lav. Turnus! Dorinda! Turn. I am Lavinia's Slave. Cam. What would the Princess have? Lav. Nymph, I adore ye!â Turn. Lavinia! Lav. Such Heav'nly Beauty! Turn. Your jealous Fears remove. Lav. With such a Grace y'are pleas'd to see her move. Cam. Live in each other, happy Pair, None so True, and none so Fair. Lav. Ungrateful Turnus! Turn. You wrong my Love. Lav. Were she but Noble, as she's Fair, I know for her you wou'd declare. Cam. 'Tis far beneath your Dignity, Thus to insult o'er Misery. Lav. Dorinda, leave me, may'st thou be Happy in any, but in him. Cam. I fly; Yet I'm a Queen, as well as she. [Exit. Lav. Fly, fly, and follow your Idol Beauty, That flies before ye. I find no Ease in The Life you gave me: Death is more pleasing, Why did you save me? But yet remember, I did adore ye. Fly, fly, &amp;c. [Exit. Turn. Her jealous Fears at once perplex and please, For Jealousie's a sign of fervent Love; Yet gladly would I give her Passion Ease, And her ill-grounded Jealousie remove. O Tyrannous Jealousie! Fly far away, no more molest, Fly from my Fair Lavinia's Breast. Resign to Love and Joy, Aspiring, And fatal Feuds desiring, A tender Lover's Passion, A Virgin's Inclination, Thou labour'st to destroy. End of the Second Act. A Dance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Noble Apartment, without a Throne. Latinus, Turnus, and Prenesto. Lat. Turnus, I rather chose t'enjoy in thee A living Friend, than kill an Enemy. Turn. With equal Care did I the Blow decline; My Life was in your Pow'r, and yours in mine. Pren. All this perhaps by Fate is wrought, Something mighty to promote. Lat. Then here in lasting Friendship let us join, My Safety be your Care, and yours be mine. But this I do demand, that you With unextinguish'd Rage pursue The Blood of Metabo, if any yet Survive new Troubles to create. Turn. To that I swear. Lat. We swear it both; And Heav'n be Witness of the Oath. But as for thee, Prenesto, do thou ever Preserve with equal Poise, within thy Soul, The Love of Peace, and Jealousie of Rule. [Exit. Turn. The Stars propitious on my Fortune shine. And fair Lavinia will be ever mine. Pren. Thou may'st with Joy the Nuptial Rites prepare, Whilst equal to thy Greatness is the Fair. The Nymph I love, I never must possess, Honour forbids that I so low should wed, Or she submit to an unlawful Bed. Hopeless I love, and ne'er must enjoy her, Turn. Happy I love, and haste to enjoy her. Pren. To Prenesto she will never yield. Turn. To my Wishes she will ready yield. Pren. Hopes declining, Turn. âJoys alluring, Pren. Avoid me. Turn. Invite me. Pren. O the Torments that poor Lovers feel! Turn. O the Pleasures that blest Lovers steal! SCENE II. Enter Lavinia and Tullia. Tul. Fear not, Dorinda I'll observe with Care, And Turnus follow with a watchful Eye: If ought shou'd pass between 'em that's unfair, You strait shall learn it from your faithful Spy. Lav. Unfaithful Turnus! Fly, ye Virgins, fly th'unfaithful Lover: False his Tears are, and fatal his Wiles. Man by Nature a Tyrant, a Rover, Gaily triumphs whene'er he beguiles. She most wise is, That despises Their feign'd Praises, and deluding Smiles. [Exit. SCENE III. Tullia manet. Enter Linco. Linc. Tullia, thou art the Idol of my Love, And Heav'n my Passion seems t'approve. Tul. I'll try some Secret to obtain. [Aside. Has the Nymph found her Reason again? Linc. That Lunacy was momentary: She's seldom us'd to a Vagary. Tul. Perhaps to Turnus then e'er this she has bow'd: Turnus has talk'd of Love, and she has vow'd. Linc. Of this I nothing know. Tul. Has she not seen him? Say. Linc. Of that I nothing know. Tul. He'll nought betray. [Aside. As thou art a Man of Sense, Excuse a Maid's Impertinence. Woman does oft employ her Tongue, In what does not to her belong. But to our own Affairs let us return, And tell how much we love, how much we burn. Linc. For thee what does my Soul endure! Tul. I know y'are wounded past a Cure. These Eyes are made so killing, That all who look must die. To Art I'm nothing owing: From Art I nothing want: These Graces genuin flowing, Despise the help of Paint. 'Tis Musick but to hear me; 'Tis fatal to come near me, And Death is in my Eye. Linc. In short, to cut off farther Speeches, Thy Tongue's more Charming than a Witches. Tul. Thou art he, my dearest Creature! Linc. Thou art she, my dearest Creature! Tul., Linc. For whose sake I'd live and die. Linc. Cruel Love for thee does wound me. Tul. I perceive it. Linc. I believe it. Tul. And to me it is no wonder: For like Thunder, Bright Charms fly round me. Linc. O my Anguish! Tul. How I languish! Pretty Creature! Linc. Hideous Feature! [Aside. Tul. For thy sake, I pine and die. For thy sakeâ [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enter Prenesto, follow'd by Camilla. Pren. Cupid, O! at length reward me, Or thy Cruelty give over. Since I'm sworn a Slave to Beauty, Since I'm constant in my Duty, Let the vanquish'd Nymph regard me, Let her crown her faithful Lover. Cam. Fortune, O! at length reward me, And thy cruel Frowns give over. Pren. For Trifles why shou'd you lament, You that are born to Misery? Cam. Perhaps the King will now relent, And his promis'd Aid deny. Pren. Wou'd I cou'd be as sure of you, As that the King will to his Word be true. Cam. Let it suffice, that all I know Of Love, I do on you bestow. Pren. Yes, yes, 'tis all I want, Nor wou'd I better thrive: A Heart for Heart is all A Lover can gain. A Happiness I feel, No Mortal can reveal. If all you have you give, I ne'er must complain. [Exit. SCENE V. Manet Camilla. Enter Turnus and Tullia. Cam. Awake, Camilla, from this Lethargy. What has Love to do with thee? Love conspiring with thy Foes, Does thy Thirst of Pow'r oppose, And yet Prenesto governs here! Vain Maid, Prenesto never can be thine, To wed Dorinda he'll decline, And I unlawful Flames disdain. Shou'd I who I am discover, And that way hope to gain my Lover, Then my Life I shou'd expose, And Death wou'd crown my Nuptial Vows. Awake, awake, my Heart, and know that I, Rather than live for Love, wou'd for Ambition die. My Heart to act is zealous; But Fear restrains my Hands. [Enter Turnus. Turn. My Lovely Charmer jealous, My Wishes still withstands. Cam. Turnus is there. Once again I'll try my Fate. Turn. My Lovely Charmer jealous, My Wishes still withstands. Cam. And I the curst Occasion Of her unjust Suspicion. [Enter Tullia. Tul. Together have I found 'em, And may the Gods confound 'em. Turn. My Heart with Grief is blasted. Cam. The Sorrow I have tasted All Sorrows is exceeding. Tul. A hopeful Traitor! Turn., Cam. My Soul in Death lyes bleeding. Tul. O that I cou'd come at her! But Vengeance is at hand. Cam. The Cares are light, that do thy Thoughts molest; But heaviest Sorrows rage within my Breast. Turn. No common Grief I do endure. Cam. Your Grief admits a ready Cure; If Lavinia scorns to love ye, Queens with Royal Charms may move ye. Tul. Perfidious Wretch! Turn. No other Charms my Heart can fire, In which Lavinia reigns entire. But shou'd Lavinia once incline To another Flame, she never wou'd be mine. Cam. Then cease thee, Turnus, to perplex, And vindicate the Honour of thy Sex. Suppose Camilla still shou'd live, To whom the Volscian Realms are due. Turn. And if Camilla shou'd survive; Cam. Then she by Hymen join'd to you, Tul. Wholesome Advice! Cam. By you restor'd in happy Hour, May bring these Kingdoms as her Dow'r. Tul. For this Dorinda, if I live, Thanks from the Princess shall receive. [Exit. Turn. To King Latinus I have giv'n My Faith, in Sight of conscious Heav'n, That Metabo's devoted Blood Shall be with Hostile Rage pursu'd. Cam. What I propose, I don't advise. Turn. Nor wou'd I from the fair Lavinia change, Tho' through the World I might a Monarch range. The Floods shall quit the Ocean, The Stars their nightly Duty. When I forsake the Beauty, That does my Heart command. The Sun shall lose his Motion, No Sand the Shore shall cover, When I forget to love her, Whose Charms I can't withstand. [Exit. SCENE VI. Manet Camilla. Cam. What hast thou said, unwary Maid? Thou by thy self art now betray'd. Dangers ev'ry way surround me, Torments fresh begin to wound me, Fate my Wishes flying. If Joy smiles a while around me, Like Flow'rs blasted, Soon 'tis wasted, And lyes a Dying. [Exit. SCENE VII. Lavinia and Latinus. Lav. She said that Queens were ready with their Charms To crown his Love, and fill his Arms. She said, Camilla still did live, And cou'd to him the Volscian Kingdom give. Lat. To a deep Dungeon let her be confin'd, Her Hands and Feet let sharpest Irons bind. Be cruel and be jealous, If safely you wou'd Rule; The Active, and the Zealous, Condemn the easie Fool. [Exit. Lav. Turnus is false, and I'm undone, Dorinda has the Conquest won; Dorinda spoke, and he obey'd, Turnus is false, and I'm betray'd. Anger's for War declaring; Love wou'd some Pity show; My Soul is not so daring, But answers No, no, no. What Hope can now relieve me; Abandon'd, and despairing; What Hand from Death reprieve me, Since Turnus gave the Blow? [Exit. SCENE VIII. Enter Metius on one side, and Linco on the other; and after Prenesto. Linc. My Lord, what Pow'r can now our Fate withstand? Camilla lyes confin'd by the King's harsh Command. Met. Confin'd! for what? Linc. I cannot learn, but fear Our close Designs have reach'd his jealous Ear. Met. Too true I fear thou hast the Cause assign'd. Linc. We are all undone! Met. Can we no Prospect find Of sudden Hope? Linc. Ev'n now methinks I feel the Rope. Met. Then Death is welcome. Enter Prenesto. Pren. Metius! Linco! Met. I stand prepar'd to bleed. Linc. And Linco is already dead. Met. Prenesto's here, what must we say? Linc. Fear has ta'en my Tongue away. Pardon my Lord; and if Camillaâ Pren. I all have heard, And sure Dorinda highly err'd. Yet though Lavinia does inspire With black Revenge my angry Sire; My Heart does to Forgiveness bow, And would prevent the fatal Blow. Met. Hopes revive! Linc. I'm still alive! Pren. With thy chosen Bands do thou To the Prison with me go. Linc. I with Conduct, void of Fear, Will follow, and bring up the Rear. Pren. 'Twixt her and Death I'll interpose, And save her from her bloody Foes. [Exit. SCENE IX. Manent Metius and Linco. Met. Fate begins to smile again, And all our former Fears were vain. Linc. So may they prove. Met. From a Prison to a Throne, Camilla will I quickly raise; The honest Soldier is our own, And readily my Will obeys. The most abandon'd have some lucky Hours; And who can tell but this is ours? Linc. Fortune too hasty does appear, So sudden a Reverse I fear. Met. Though fierce the Light'ning flies, Some Joy it brings our Eyes, In Darkness straying. The Rays our Feet directing, From Precipice protecting, A Glimpse of Life procure us, From Death a while secure us; Destruction staying. [Exit Metius. SCENE X. Manet Linco. Linc. The Court for certain's the best School, To make a States-Man of a Fool. Since I came hither I've learnt more Then I knew all my Life before. Linco's grown another Creature; See this Look, behold this Feature; Show me such a Transformation. Wanton Lasses, with smooth Faces, Brown or Yellow, Ruddy, Sallow, With an Ogle thus I warm ye; With a Motion thus I charm ye; Let this learned Wig speak for me; Let this Shape and Air inform ye, I'm Sir Courtly of the Nation. [Exit. SCENE XI. Enter Lavinia and Turnus. Lav. You've both beyond Forgiveness err'd; Dorinda spoke, and Turnus heard. Turn. Firm to my Vows I still abide. Lav. Go, let Camilla be your Bride. Turn. Banish that Anger from your Eyes, And cease your Vassal to despise. Lav. Haste, and new Realms acquire; but know, That Royal Nuptials wait us too. Turn. Cease, Cruel, Tyrannizing, Give your Resentments over; Unless, my Vows despising, You kill your Lover. Ah! you kill your Lover! You are my Soul's Ambition; I have no Wish above ye. Unjust is your Suspicion; I constant Love ye. Lav. These Pangs of Love I can no longer bear, My Cruelty was feign'd, my Love sincere. Turnus! Turn. Lavinia! Lav. Cease, Cruel, to deceive me, Give, give your Falshood over; Lest when unkind you leave me, You kill your Lover! Ah! you kill your Lover! Let me be your Ambition, And taste no Bliss above me. Blest will be my Condition If you can love me. Both. Cease, cruel, &amp;c. [Exeunt. SCENE XII. A Prison. Enter Camilla; and after Prenesto, Metius, and Linco, and People. Cam. Fate, the more it does depress me, Makes me stronger in enduring; Fortune never shall oppress me, Death has Charms all Sorrows curing. Enter Prenesto, Metius, Linco, &amp;c. Pren. Dorinda, cease thee to complain; Thus I break th'unworthy Chain. Cam. Much I owe for this Release. Pren. Fly hence, Dorinda, and let these Conduct thee to some other Clime, Where safe thou may'st forgive my Father's Crime. Love does a dangerous Task impose, Giving thee Life, I do my own expose. Met. Say, Madam, am I understood? Cam. Is your Assurance firm and good? Met. As firm as Fate. Cam. All these, you say, (To Pren.) Are arm'd in my Defence, and must my Will obey? Pren. They are your Slaves. Cam. Let me this Proof of your Obedience find: Disarm the Prince, and see him close Confin'd. Pren. From whence this Boldness, treacherous Maid? Met. Submit thy self. Pren. I am betray'd. Linc. In vain with a defenceless Hand, You strive our Numbers to withstand. Cam. My Arts successfully have thriv'n, Sure Token of indulgent Heav'n. My People call me to the Throne, From whence they drag Latinus down: For know, Prenesto, I'm a Queen; in me No more Dorinda, but Camilla see. [Exeunt all but Pren. SCENE XIII. Pren. Camilla! Metius is a treacherous Slave! Curse on these Fetters! O! how I cou'd rave! The Furies rage within my troubled Breast; I am with all the Plagues of Hell possest. Lavinia! Father! Metius! Camilla! Let the Light'ning, Flashing, Flying, Dreadful Thunder, Fates defying, Rend the guilty World asunder, But Camilla, O forbear her! Let th'Avenger Of Justice spare her. Let Alecto never find her. Love enrag'd to Prenesto has resign'd her. [Exit. SCENE XIV. A Hall of Entertainment. Enter Latinus, Turnus, Lavinia, Attedants, &amp;c. Begins with a Dance. Lat. Lavinia here from me receive. Turn. Matchless is the Fair you give. Lav. Hail happy Hour, I now am bless'd. Turn. Lavinia, Hand and Heart I here present thee. Enter Tullia. Tul. To Arms, to Arms! Rebellious Crouds Haste to the Palace. Lat. Whence this Noise? Tul. The People, with a general Voice, Cry, Live Camilla! and they cry, Guilty Latinus, let him die. Lat. Camilla! and alive! Lav. O fatal Change! Turn. I will in thy Defence advance. Lat. Old tho' I am, yet still I know To weild the Sword, and bend the Bow. SCENE the Last. Camilla and her Party Enter, and after some Resistance Disarm Latinus and the rest; whilst a Trumpet-Sonata Plays, at the Triple of which, Enter Camilla. Tul. Mercy! to a tender Maid! Cam. Haste, Linco, And hither see the Prince convey'd; Chain'd like a Pris'ner let him come, And here attend from me his Doom. Lat. My Son in Chains! Turn. Relentless Fate! Cam. To Tyrants and Usurpers too, Severest Vengeance sure is due. Prenesto is brought in. Lat. My Son! Lav. My dearest Brother! Pren. Lavinia! Father! Turn. Prenesto! Pren. Turnus! Cam. No more! Your ineffectual Tears give o'er. Prenesto first by this shall bleed; And when in thy Lavinia's Blood 'tis dy'd, Thine shall swell the Purple Tide. Tul. O Bloody! Turn. Cruel Fiend of Hell! Lav. A Weight upon my Heart I feel! Lat. A deadly Cold has mine possess'd. Cam. Die then, Prenesto. Pren. Strike! Cam. But on this Breast. Pren. Ye Heav'nly Powers! Cam. Love has prevail'd, and Anger is no more. Lat. O Heav'n! Turn. O Love! Lav. O Fate! Cam. To skreen thee from the Peoples Hate, Their fatal Malice to prevent, I doom'd thee to Imprisonment. I acted an ungrateful Part, But Love contriv'd the pious Cheat: Henceforth be Sov'raign of my Heart, And rule it in an Husband's Right. Pren. A Joy so sudden, I can scarce believe. Cam. Metius, a just Reward thou shalt receive, For thy great Service. Fair Lavinia, now, Be you in Turnus happy, he in you. Turn. The Gods are just. Cam. And Sir, do you [To Latinus. Learn what to Justice, and to Merit's due. Revenge was in my Power. Do you forget To prosecute our House with Hostile Hate. Lat. Hate is driven out of the Field, And Anger does to Freindship yield. Cam. Let Peace and Love possess each Heart. Tul. Thou art my Cupid. Linc. Thou my Psyche art. Pren. Care is fled; Despair's no more. Turn. Give, my Heart, thy Sorrows o're. Pren., Turn. Love has smil'd; and I'm rewarded./my Vows regarded. CHOR. Happy, happy is the Swain, Who loves, and has not lov'd in vain. [Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
