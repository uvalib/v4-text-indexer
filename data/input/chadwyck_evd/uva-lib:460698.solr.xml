      <field name="fulltext">TO JOHN FORSTER, ESQ. IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF MANY ACTS OF KINDNESS RENDERED TO THE AUTHOR, IN THE COURSE OF HIS DRAMATIC CAREER, This Play IS DEDICATED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. The King Mr. Ryder. Duke of Gaveston Mr. G. Bennett. Lord Sherbrooke Mr. Hudson. Lord Byerdale Mr. Phelps. Lord Sunbury Mr. Waldron. Sir George Barkley Mr. Graham. Sir Richard Fenwick Mr. Lynne. Sir John Friend Mr. Mellon. Sir William Parkyn Mr. Roberts. Colonel Green Mr. Macready. Wilton Mr. Anderson. Harrison Mr. Lambert. Charnock Mr. C. J. Smith. Armstrong Mr. Selby. Williams Mr. Yarnold. Page Mr. Stanton. Lady Laura Gaveston Miss Helen Faucit. Emmeline Mrs. Wigan. Conspirators, &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âLord Byerdale's Study.âWilton seated at a table in the act of writing.âSeveral folded letters before him, other letters lying open, papers, &amp;c. Wilt. That memory should feed itself!âwax stronger In its impression, without agency Of that which wrought it; till the simulationâ For e'en so much it isâgrows palpable As the originalâholds commune with Our ears and eyes, yet all's within ourself! At first her image was a dreamy thing That came and went, and might, for aught I deem'd, Have gone for everânow 'tis ever with me! Substantial presence! steadfast constancy! I write, I read, I talk, and breaking off In listless absence, to myself return In company with her! She is my theme That supersedes all others! Why is this? What do I nourish? Hope in spite of hope! Madness of wishesânever to be bless'd! Her groom is not beneath her more than I, The secretary of a haughty lord! His clerk!âthat in his counsels holds no share More than his pen! What better should I be?â A man who claims no core of kith or kin In the wide world! I had a friendâa good And gracious oneâwho foster'd me, to play A higher part. Compell'd by urgent cause To travel, to this lord he left the care Of my advancementâleft, as to a friend! But friends at second-hand are doubtful ones! Where will it end?âO perfect imaging Of sweetness!âgrace!âaspect of soul and form Most rich in all that man desires in woman! Rare excellence!âWhy, where am I again? Along with her! Gazing upon herârapt With marvel at the glory of her presence! [Lord Byerdale enters.âStops short, and stands observing Wilton's abstraction.âAdvances and addresses him impatiently. Lord By. So! Are those letters finished? Wilt. But the seals And superscriptions. Lord By. Get them out of hand! He grows abstracted. Lady Laura's tone Had matter in it when she ask'd for him. Why minds he me of her? She values much, I hear, the service which he render'd her. A man of prowess is my secretary, And presence too! 'Tis not of her he thinks? Think of an empress!âDoes she think of him? A lady with a will, as I am told! A judge of merits!âdoes not take a year To tell her mind!âThat children should have minds! Be she not of the mind to wed my son, When he shall sue herâwhich he shall to-dayâ Look to't his Grace of Gaveston! He must plot! He would reseat the Stuart!âWould he so? Eyes are upon his Grace he wots not of! She ask'd for Wiltonânever named my son! The very man, indeed, he is wherewith Romancists matches disproportionate Contractâwed pages with their mistresses! Would my Lord Sunbury had kept at home, Not palm'd on me his seemly protÃ©gÃ©! He roams to France, and finds a prison there! There's something in his presence troubles me. So sat my brother when he play'd the clerk, With sword on thigh, rather than pen in hand; You saw the soldier, whatsoe'er he did! Is it his son? I shall be soon resolved! My trusty messenger returns to-day. Wilt. [Rising.] My lord, they are ready. Lord By. Go and post them, sir, With your own hand. Tarry, sir; you will pass His Grace of Gaveston's house; and should you callâ Wilt. Call there, my lord? Lord By. Yes; you do call there? Wilt. No. Lord By. You have been there? Wilt. No, my lord. Lord By. Go, post the letters! [Wilton goes out. How far above his errand is his gait! I could believe my brother living still, And striding forth the door!âHe goes not there. 'Tis well he's modest! Will there come the day When I shall see him knocking at the gate As though he were at home? Would he were hence! Why did I ever see him? Ha! Who's come? [To Williams, who enters. Will. My lord, your messenger to Ireland sent. Lord By. Admit him. Fear or hope is now at end. Welcome! What bring you? [To Harrison, who enters. Har. [Giving papers.] For your lordship these. Lord By. [To Harrison, who goes out.] Go, get refresh'd! [Reads.] âThey never reach'd the ship!â âLanded again ten miles below the creek!â They told me false then. Gold finds out the truth! So both survived! But Leonard now is dead, And for the nephewâthanks to self-will'd loveâ He breathes without his name! What fear I, then? What though he be my eldest brother's son! [Goes out. SCENE II. âHyde Park. Enter Colonel Green and Wilton. Wilt. Sir, I would walk aloneâMen may take leave To choose their own acquaintance! Frankly, you Are hardly to my tasteâWhat are you, sir? Green. What am I?âWhy the man that wears this suit, That owns this trunk, these thews, these features!âWell! Are you content?âor would you learn my name And family? Beware, sir! Tell your own. Wilt. I cannot! Green. You are right!âTo say âNo more âCan I,â were flippantly to answer you; Still, as I yet have held it wisdom, when With wit or truth we must part company, To let the lighter go, I claim the knowledge Which you confess to lack. Wilt. You know my name And family? Green. I know my own. Wilt. Not mine! Green. What then? Is't matter for despondency? Wilt. The man that toils along a weary road Beneath a burthen, and, miscounting, thinks The time is come, at last, to lay it down, With weight augmented takes it up again To bear it onward still. Green. You are not yet Of age. Wilt. How know you that? Green. What matter how, So that I know? The knowledge on't is neither Murder nor theft! It might be treasonâbut It is not that. What friend have you beside The Earl of Sunbury? Wilt. How know you he's My friend? Green. Why ply a bootless labour twice? I know it. That content you!âWho besides Rank in the list, more, often, fill than ought? Wilt. I count but oneâLord Sherbrooke. Green. Son of him You're secretary toâLord Byerdale. Wilt. You seem to know me well! Green. I seem? I do! Lord Byerdale!âis he your friend too? Wilt. No. Green. Nor friend to any who deserve a friend! Wilt. Who are you, sir? Green. You have been bred at college. You have won honours thereâand high ones, too. A college is a place to sharpen wit, Or ought to be. A slight hint should suffice; And yet, it seems, you cannot take a broad one. Wilt. Sir, I love openness and honour. Green. Right! And so do I. I mean you not to know me! So much for openness!âand, as to honour, Judge me as you find me! Wilt. Thereby judging you, How shall I rate you in the property In question last; when, calmly looking on, You suffer'd lawless violence to leaguer A noble lady and her sire, nor stirr'd A finger to their rescue? Green. Motives, sir, Give shape to facts, which often change them To things the most diverse from what they seem. Thus far know mineâI weigh'd the risk, was run, And framed my conduct to the amount of it. A score of crowns to needy gentlemen Was worth, perhaps, the violence they did Their better natures, so to practise on A lady's fright. In these disjointed times, Try as you may, things will not go by rule! William of Nassau fills the throne to-dayâ Wilt. [Interrupting him.] Long may he fill it, sir, and hand it down An heir-loom with a people's guarantee To an unfailing race! Green. [Vehemently.] Youth, 'twas not thus!â [Checks himself. But those who left you in your infancy, To take the course which others counted best, Have but themselves to thank! I'll not be one To check the faith, that, now, must bear thee through! Wilt. You are a man of honour. Green. By my foes I have been counted so. Where left we off? Where it were best we leave the argument. Wilt. One word, sir, to go back. Green. Say on! Wilt. From what You said just now, I think I must have friends I know not ofâ Green. You have. Wilt. Who are they? Green. Yet You may not know. Wilt. But shall I ever know? Green. As sure as life holds on with them and you! Now to the cause that makes you jealous of meâ My passive bearing at a certain time. Your arm achieved what mine forbore to doâ Mark me!âforbore!ârescued the noble sire And yet more noble child. Wilt. More noble? Green. Yes; Better! You have seen them? Wilt. No. Green. You would be welcome. Hast thought upon the maid?âI see thou hast. Wilt. Sir! Green. Are you vapour? Do I see you now, And now are you away? Wilt. What mean you, sir? Green. A minute since I was a man of honour! Wilt. You are so still. Green. And such shall be approved. So trust you me!âHast thought upon the maid? Wilt. I have! Green. 'Twas fit!â'Twas fair!â'Twas paying back What you receivedâfor she has thought of you! Mark!âAt the moment that you stood her friend, She grew your love!âYouth's in a blaze, and sees Not half what passes round it!âWhen to flight You put her enemies, you little thought That, after all your pains, the maid was robb'd! Wilt. Robb'd!â Green. Of her heartâI saw it on the arm Where but her figure seem'd to hang, the while You led her to the carriage. Wilt. Do you know Who was the lady? Green. Daughter to the Duke Of Gaveston. Wilt. Yes; and I an humble man! Green. You are not an humble manâthat isâI am right!â And stand to what I sayâa man that owns A noble soul is not an humble man, In the poor sense wherein the sapient world Mouths out the trite and questionable phrase! Wilt. Who are you, sir?âForgive me!âI'm content To know you by your thoughts. Green. Whereto I'll add My deeds in time, with every adjunct else! Hie to the Duke's! He owes thee benefit; And welcome will he give thee as a friend, Though dull to what's to come, as dawn to day When the sun's up and glow is turn'd to fire! His daughter pines for sight of him again, Whom the first sight commended so, all else To vision is a blank! I say again Thou art no humble man! Revolve my words With boldest spirit.âDare, and you shall win! My counsel needing, or my help, this scrawl Will prove your guide, although a homely one. 'Tire never yet was flesh and blood, no more Than mind and heart! The man is still the man! [Goes out. Wilt. As fanning wind will bring to blaze again The fire we thought was out, but only smoulder'd; So, at his word, my only smother'd hopes Revive, when, doting, I believed them dead. Here Sherbrooke comesâindeed my hearty friend, But, for my humour, all too light a one. Enter Sherbrooke. Sher. So, Master Secretary, health to you! If health you wishâfor he's a fool who serves A man against his humourâthe right road To make an enemy! Each man has his bliss According to his nature. One will mope; A squadron could not drag him to a feast! Leave him, good soul, alone, with knees to chin, Feet on the fender, sitting all a-heap Over the embers winking in the grate! He's happy!âWith the spleen another man Is smittenâchampions it as cavalier His lady-love! âHave at you, sir!â would you come Betwixt him and his humour. Do you see That scowl?âIt is his mistress' favour which He wears with thin and bitter curling lip, All the year round, spite of the laughing sun. And why not, sir? He is a happy man!â As happy as he can be!âLet him be! And there are men, saving your reverence, Who, with the thorax sound as a new drum, Waste with the melting rheumâwould you believe them? With trunks like culverins, and limbs of brawn, They shake with rigors at a thorough air! No month but brings its proper malady, Of which they're sure to die!âyet do they live, And sleep, and wake, and talk, and eat, and drink, Until perhaps some nostrum makes an end!â Yet are they happy, sir, in their own way. Wilt. These are anomalies 'mongst men. Sher. Not so: The world's made up of such! Few wisely live. The wise man, sir, is the anomaly! Wilt. You're in the mood contemplative to-day. Sher. I amâI am about to seek a wife. Why do you start?âI do not say to take one. Wilt. About to wed? Sher. My father wills it so. But fathers do not settle marriage brawls: A pity, then, they settle marriages. Better their children. Men complain the less, When, for their cares, they have themselves to thank. Wilt. And may I know the lady? Sher. You have met her. Wilt. Met her!â Sher. Let's see. The time was evening. 'Twas A lone sequester'd spot.âCouldn't I write A deep romance?âA fear-bewilder'd sire And shrieking damsel, by a lawless band Beset.âA situation!âWho comes in? The hero of my storyâor the book Is matter for the fire! So in he comes! Alone? Of course aloneâmost hero-like! One against five!âTwenty were few as five,â No hero ever takes account of odds! Is he o'erpower'd? Not if the scribe has thews. His blows fell two, his eyes flash down the rest; Reauty and Ageâweak guardian of such storeâ Are rescued in the very nick of time! Fraud its inglorious field inglorious flies, And Age is free to hobble. Not so Beauty; For Beauty's soft of heart and frail of limb, And like to swoon in an extremity; Which if the author sees not, he hath got A cataract, and couch his eyes for him With his own pen!âI am not such a one. When I attempt a book, I write a book! The lady needs support,âwho yields it her? The hero 'fore the king, were the king by! Upon the hero leans the heroine! At first half-willinglyâmore willingly Anon,âanon with all her heart and soul,â And so, and so, and so, is borne away! You'll read my work and give it a good name? Why, what's the matter, man? You're dumb and pale. Heavens! if the first step overpowers you so, How will you mount my climax as it towers? Wilton! Wilt. My lord? Sher. My friend!âI brook not lord! Or call me âSherbrookeââthat's the friendly mode. What gaze you at in vacancy? A phantom? Wilton, it is a phantom that you see. If aught that gives you painâI would not wed The Lady Laura Gaveston! Wilt. What is she To me? Sher. Nothingâif not the self-same thing You are to her!âWilton, she has lost her heart, And you have got it. Wilt. Sherbrookeâ Sher. That's the word! Shake hands, man! Listen! At the play last night I sat with her. She spoke a library, If âyeaâ and ânayâ make volumes. Only once The scene attracted her. The heroine Was rescued by her lover. Had you heard The sighs with which she follow'd, step by step, The progress of the touching incident!â My book shall beat it, though!âIf you feel, speak! Or is it that you feel too much to speak? Do you note me, Wilton? All the rest of the time Her eyes kept traversing the tiers, as though In quest of one they sought but could not find; For ne'er they fix'd, save when there oped a door, And then they turn'd away to range again! The wish'd one came not in!âa circumstance Of tender implication to dilate on. I'll turn it to account!âMy book is writ!â And at the close, when on the vestibule We hung awhile to wait her hinder'd coach, Jove! how she scann'd the beaux!âSome management To make that pass with prudes, who read aloudâ And when the steps at last gave note to mount, How with a sigh she went all listless in, Scarce giving me Good night! Wilt. How know you whom She look'd forâif she look'd for any one? Sher. By this and this. First, her absorption at That critical and memory-stirring scene, The counterpart of one which you and she Enacted once with marvellous effectâ Methinks a document!âIn the next place, The potency of certain words as plain As âWilton Brownâ no kin at all to famed Abracadabra!âto enchain her ear And make the blood with ebb and flow enact The tide upon the haven of her cheek, And hold her lips disparted like to those Who stint their breath with thrilling of a tale; As with her father I discuss'd a point Touching the argument, whereon I mean To take my stand 'mongst literary men!â And, add to this, as proof superlative, Her tongue is never weary of your name, Which, once 'tis broach'd, she more and more repeats, Like strain that grows on us the more 'tis sung! Wilton, the Lady Laura loves you, man! Wilt. Sherbrooke, remember I'm an humble man! Sher. You are not an humble man! Wilt. Again! How's this? I am bewilder'dâ Sher. Love is not a plain, But an entangling maze. Wilt. I do not speak Of love! You say I am no humble man? Sher. And say't again. Wilt. Your father's secretary! Sher. And what am I that am my father's son? Intrinsically humbler far than you. Wilton, think boldly of yourself! Wilt. Again! Look hereâAs now you speak, so spoke the man Who gave me this. [Showing a paper. Sher. Let's see it!ââColonel Greenâ âAt the Green Dragonââchallenge for St. George! And you, an humble man! Wilt. What man is he Who gave me that? Sher. [Returning the paper.] An honourable one; Albeit he draws not sword when he beholds A lady leagur'd on the king's highway. Wilt. Is he of the craft? Sher. There, breathe at ease, my friend, He is not. Wilton, sound men drive that trade. Don't wonder!âWhen a kingdom's upside down, What man can say he is to-day himself As he was yesterday? The battle's chance Brings change of pocketsâlight for heavy ones; Lank purses; or, for old ones, but their room; New masters to old mansions, and so forth!â I do not justify, I but excuse. There is at times a conscience in offence, For which the best abate the penalty. But to my Dulcinea and her knight! My father wills I go and woo the fair. I go and woo, but you must come and win! Wilt. What! Go along with you? No!ânot a step, When Honour forbids me, not! Sher. Forbid the prude To waste her breath until she sees the strait. Wilt. To 'scape the strait 'twere best to shun it. Sher. So, The navigator never had gone through! Wilton, you'll helm it, spite of shoal and rock, And laugh beyond in the bright open sea! I'll have you come with me!âNay, scowl away! What! jealousy!ânip friendship, will you?âbut You shall not, by this honest arm and hand! Come on! Wilt. Nay, Sherbrookeâ Sher. Nay, come on!âCome on! [Goes out, forcing Wilton with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Chamber in the Duke of Gaveston's house. Enter the Duke. Duke. How changed my daughter is!âI know her not Since our adventure on the king's highway. Or love has turn'd her wits for her, or fright. The staid recluse of yesterday, to-day Is lady of the crowd! She now frequents Assembliesâplaysâall haunts of throng'd resort. What draws her forth so much? I can't surmise! But from herself the knowledge of the cause Of such a metamorphosis can come. For quiet, restlessness!âfrom books to sights! I'll tax her home upon it. She's obedient; Yet, once her purpose fix'd, is hard to move. Suitor she never brook'd!âMen's merits, still Has thought, should ever 'bove their stations mount. I had a fearâbut no!âBut once they metâ The heart forgets, when cease the eyes to prompt. See where she thoughtful moves with eyes on ground! Another timeâwhen she's in lighter mood. Her heart, upon its guard, might foil me now. [Goes out. Enter Lady Laura. Lady Lau. Where does he hide, while gallants, not his tithe In manly bearing, beauty, and desert, Vie for the lead, and with comparisons Set all the world at odds?âLet him appear Among them, all will shrink, at once, to one! The world will be one eye, one ear, one tongue, Awarding him the palm, past all compare! Or would it slight his merits for his rank? What of his rank?âIs't his disparagement That Fortune 's blind?âLet Fortune take the blameâ Or rather men, who laud, where she prefers, Even while they know she sees not what she does! Why, let them like idolaters bow down Before the works of their own hands!âLove bends At Heaven's command aloneâinforming Love! Honest and clear of sight, whose piercing eye Vies with the lapidary'sâknows the gem, Whate'er the setting! Strange that I, a maid, Who held her single state so sovereignly, No suitor ever twice drew near to woo, Should now regard it as a barren sway, Dominion of some far and desert isle, Which he who owns it gladly would exchange For slavery in some blest continent! Love, if I slighted thee, thou'rt well revenged; I'm all thy subject now; but for my gains Have nought, except my servitude, to boast; Denied exchange of speech or sight with him Who made me doff defiance of thy rule! Enter Emmeline. Emme. Lord Sherbrooke, madam, and a friendâ Lady Lau. A friend? What! has his friend no name?âNo lofty one, Or he'd be sure to give it!âShow him in. Stay! Do you know the gentleman that comes Along with him? Emme. Not, as I think, my lady. His back was towards me, but I dare be sworn He has a noble presence. Lady Lau. To be sure! He comes in noble company. The sun Makes vapours that are near him turn to gold! Go!â[Emmeline goes out.] I am sick of you and all the world!â And all the world!âI would the jest were o'er! The poorâpoor jest, that so misplaces things, We know not what we look at! Everywhere, Except in human nature, qualities Determine uses. No one sets to build A garden-wall to train a sloe or crab, Or rears a thistle in a hothouse bed! Well, well! if essences, in other things, Keep rule, 'tis fit perhaps they jumble men. I'm sick of life! 'Tis one against the million, So let the million have its way!âIt will! Lord weds with lady.âWhy?âBecause a lord! A common match would find a better reason! Yet no; 'tis rank all throughânothing but rank! Craft weds with craftâprofession with profession Weddings for clothes! From top to bottom all's At odds with reason! Human life is ravell'd, And love itself can't make the thread run clear. The work that only frets 'twere best give o'er; Only don't help to make the puzzle worse! Let the world be! It is too old to mend; What 'tis, it was, and will be to the end! [Emmeline enters, conducting Wilton and Sherbrooke, and retires. Sher. Madam, I take leave to present myself, And, with myself, my friend. Lady Lau. Your friend and you, My lord, are welcome in all courtesy. Sher. [Aside to Wilton.] A welcome for a lover! Mark you that? An answer, too, before the question's put! She never raised her eyesâThat's hope! They say A maid in love still goes with downcast looks. But she may lock her vision in her heart; And, if she does, I'll stake my coronet You're there along with it. Wilt. [Uneasily.] Accost her, Sherbrooke! Sher. And if I do, what shall I say to her? That 'tis a fair day?âthat 'tis very warm? Or very cool?âOr that I hope she's well, And hope his Grace, her father, is the same? That the new fashions are come out, and belles, To please their beaux, now meet them with sour looks? That beaux, to wive, come wooing for their friends? That, nowadays, things find their proper way By going contrary?âa paradox! Or that the world is in its childhood yet, And hopes to come to manhoodâif it lives? Or what? Come, Wilton, you take up the word, And help a man that can't get through his task! Speak to her, WiltonâWish her a good morning! Say anything to her. Lady Lau. A fine day, my lord! The tables turn when ladies must speak first. [Aside. Sher. Madam, the day is very fine indeed; At least, I think so. But what thinks my friend?â For he is a philosopher, and knows Fine weather is the kind that's wanted most. A calm is fineâthe sailor wants a breeze: Sunshine is fineâthe farmer wants a cloud: One looks for frost, another looks for snow, Another looks for rainâthough none for sleet! Thus, uses make the excellence of things; At least, I think so, madam. What thinks Wilton? Lady Lau. Wilton! Wilt. Nay, Sherbrooke. Sher. I will have you speak! Madam, my friend is very weatherwise. You call it a fine day, and so do I; But come, what think you, Wilton? Lady Lau. It is he! Oh, sir, I'm glad to see you!âvery glad! Though somewhat too confused to show it you. BecauseâbecauseâI saw you not at onceâ Andâfind you standingâand his lordship tooâ Pray you excuse a moping, absent girl, And let her make amendsâandâPray take chairs! Sher. [Aside to Wilton.] I might have dropp'd, you see, if not for you. Now will I court her to your very face! Fair Lady Laura Gaveston! Lady Lau. [Coldly.] Well, my lord? Sher. My friend suspects the weather. Wilt. [Aside to Sherbrooke.] Nay! Sher. You do. He thinks, though now so fine, there's chance of hail; For it is April, as you knowâa month When here will be a shower, and sunshine there; So one goes dry, another dripping wet. The sky's a puzzle; but there are stranger things! You know my errand, Lady Laura; still I tell it you to show I know it too; And, for your answer, that, I well foresee! But would not balk your bright lips of their right To speak, themselves, the will of her they serve. My father hither sends his hopeful sonâ Although in hopeless moodâto seek a wife. I say, in hopeless mood; for bonds, you know, Although they be of silk, are things that bind; And, to be plain, I love my liberty! I'll make but a poor husband at the best; But, if you will, I'll make the best I can. I court you, lady, for my father's sake, In the first placeâa son can say no less; In the next place, I court you for your own: A lover, I presume, can say no more. Now, as I know brief wooing prospers best, One way or t'other bringing to an end What else had cost much time, were better saved; My courtship, promptly, as you see, begun, I bring as promptly to a graceful close. But as 'tis fit my merits you should knowâ The proper ground of failure or successâ And as wise men speak little of themselves, But trust, in these regards, to others' tongues; The blanks which I have leftâand not a fewâ I leave my friend in kindness to fill up! Wilton, I'll wait you in the ante-room. Wilt. [Rising.] Sherbrookeâ Sher. [Pushing him down again.] Nay, take your seat again. For shame! What! Frighted of a lady's company? Or, madam, is the gentleman to stay At my requestâor do you wish him gone? Lady Lau. The gentleman will stayâat my request! Sher. [Aside to Wilton.] Wilton, what think you of the weather now? Madam, I dare be bound he'll do your will, Though 'twere not back'd by mineâI take my leave; And with the more content, because I knowâ And here I speak the bare and steadfast truthâ I leave with you the manâI boast my friend. [Goes out. Lady Lau. Sir, you will deem me bold to wish you stay; Yet, sooth, the blame is yours. When creditors Are modest, and hold off, the debtor's shamed That comes not forthâif not to pay his debt, At least to grace it with acknowledgment! Wilt. You owe me nothing, lady. Lady Lau. Nothing!âNo!â And weighs my life, sir, nothing in your eyes? Although perhaps a trifle in my own! Wilt. Your life!âO, lady!â Lady Lau. Well, sir?âWell?âSay on! Is't nothing?âYet my gratitude's a heap; But that, perhaps, is nothing! Wilt. Were't deserved, So muchâsave one thingâI could wish no more! Lady Lau. I will believe you; yet, could almost doubt; For let me ask why what you valued so You took no pains to learn, if render'd you?â Don't speak!âI know!âdesert that's true holds back! Ere challenge its reward, would let it go! Yet, in my own defence I must be frank, And tell you I have wish'd to see you, sir; Nor once, but oft; nor much, but earnestly, To tell you all I feel I owe you, sir; And still, though I defended you just now, Charging your absence to the proper cause, Yet must you bear some blameâfor though you had Your feelings, sir, we had our feelings too, For which 'twere not unjust to credit us; Which crediting, 'twere hardly generous To grieve with needless pain!âour nameâabode My father gave youâso methinks did I. They were not idly given, but for a purpose; They were not coldly given, but heartily; They meant an invitationâIt is true 'Twas not accepted by your lips, and yet I thought your looks gave token of as much. If I thought wrong, I grieve for my mistakeâ I would not think you never meant to come! Wilt. 'Twas true! Lady Lau. 'Twas strange!âTo risk your life for us, Yet grudge a step to seeâthat we were well. Wilt. I heard that you were wellâI knew you were. Lady Lau. And that contented you. Sir, I have friends I know are well, yet I would see them too. But then, they are dear friendsâyou are very right. 'Twere almost bold to say we are acquaintance; Yet, though you think me forward, I shall say We were not losers, did you rate us more. Wilt. More?âO much more!âMore than I dare to name! Lady Lau. [Aside.] I could believe the wish that's in my breast Is throbbing now in hisâI am beloved! Sir, you say nothing, or you say too muchâ I mean too much for faith.âMore than acquaintanceâ Would be a friendâmuch more wereâmore than thatâ O lips, be muteâwhen looks can talk so well! The more his tongue refrains, the more he speaks! Wilt. O, were I sureâ Lady Lau. Of what? Wilt. That I could claim A royal stock! Lady Lau. What then?âBe frank!âWhat then? Wilt. Why then I might to lady high as you Proffer my heart. Lady Lau. You then would condescend! And, think you, none can condescend but you? Wouldst like meâfor a friend? Wilt. No! Lady Lau. No? Wilt. A friend Lies near the heart; but then there is the core, That looks for something else. Lady Lau. Which you have found! No? Wilt. Yes! Lady Lau. A mistress? Wilt. Yes! Lady Lau. Where does she bide? Wilt. Where does she bide! O Honour, is it right To take advantage of the love for us That would undo itselfâdescend for us From stateâmake partnership with namelessnessâ Convert high veneration into scornâ Quit the bright pageant of emblazon'd life, To play a poor part in the daily crowd? Lady Lau. Nothing!âAll nothing! Wilt. Cast itself awayâ Give allâgain naughtâunless abasement's gainâ Naught but a heart, which any one could give? Lady Lau. No!âonly oneâworth all that ever beat, Cheap purchased with her own! Wilt. [Aside.] O, generous maid! And shall I take thy sterling gold for dross? I must, or I must fly! Lady, farewell! Lady Lau. Stay! You have stopp'd too long to go so soon! Was there not something to be said? A word About your friend? Well, sir; sit down and say it. Wilt. My friend is noble. Lady Lau. Ay! He is noble, is he? Has he a heart? Wilt. A brave, and warm one, too! A man more modest than he loves to show. Lady Lau. Sir, let him show the most he may, I'll find The man will prove him very braggart there,â A man to love whom is to boast one's self, So is he lord of all true nobleness! A man who rescued once a lady's life; Who, for the chance of such salvation only, Would risk that life again 'gainst twice the odds! Why do you hang your head? Desert for shame! Assert yourself, erect your brow, and cast A thousand round you down, that only tower, Because you please to droop! O doubtful pass To come to!âfor a maiden unenforced To tell her love!âWhat can be urged for her? What can she urge herself?âWhy this, that Heaven Inform'd her; so she knew its handiwork, And worshipp'd Heaven in it!âAlmost, and more Than once, you've said you loved me, but stopp'd short! I hold a virtue higher than a grace, So prefer honesty to bashfulnessâ As, by this time, perhaps, you more than guess: Then, where you halted, will I e'en go on, And tell youâyet why need I?âall is said But the plain downright word, which, if I speak, I shall not make you wise a tittle more; Yet 'tis the word, and I will out with itâ You love me, Wilton, and 'tis love for love! Why, Wilton, where's your heart? Wilt. Here at your feet! Lady Lau. Then 'tis a contract. Wilt. Yes. Lady Lau. How long to last? Wilt. For life. Lady Lau. No less a term!âWere't but a jot Shorter than that, I'd have the compact torn And scatter'd to the winds! For life? Wilt. For life! [The Duke of Gaveston enters. Lady Lau. Then, Wilton, I am yours. But mark me, yet; My father cannot wed me 'gainst my willâ Against my father's will I'll never wedâ If I wed ever, Wilton, 'tis with you! Duke. What means this, daughter? Lady Lau. Did you overhear? Duke. I did! For shame! Lady Lau. Nay, father, say for shame When I recall that, which you overheard! What I'll repeat, nor pay, nor owe, a blush! You are a dukeâI am your grace's child. We both are debtors to this gentleman To an amount that's something near the worth Of both our lives!âYou oft have mention'd him With gratitudeâand, what you spoke, I felt, And call'd to mind the time when heroes wore The trophies that they won, though emperors'; And wish'dâay did I, from my heart's deep coreâ Such times were now for him! Up to him, father! Give him the generous hand. If fault there is, The penalty be mineâo'erleap the gap Rank sets between youâreverence the thing You owe your title toâwhereby alone The ancestor that sent it down to you Won it!âDesert!âThe stamp were, else, a brand! Duke. I own myself your grateful debtor, sir, And what I owe you, sir, I would repay; And pray you take my hand as warranty, Which, as I reckon'd you a man of honour, I think you know the proper limits of, And, knowing, will respect them.âSir, your leave To hold some brief communion with my child, As what has pass'd behoves her to review! Lady Lau. Wilton, 'twas all review'd before it pass'd. Father, I utter it with reverence To you!âIt was no idle passing thoughtâ A seedling just appearing above ground, A foot could mock of growth and sweep away; But a deep, fibrous, and abounding root, Which, tearing up, you tear up all the ground, And that isâall my heart!âWith this, farewell! What fruit the tree may bear but time can tell! [They go out severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âLord Byerdale's Study. Enter Lord Sherbrooke and Wilton. Sher. A maid of mettle, Wilton!âa warm heart, And honest tooâtoo noble in her wish, To stint her tongue. She does not mew her love, As thus: A well-deserving gentleman, She'd fain believe. Deny it, she would swear to't; She would!âsufficient comelyâall the while She thinks him paragon. A man, no doubt, A lady might affect!âwhile she is smit Beyond all doubt! A very proper stature; What some would call a straight and well-shaped man! Companion e'en for him of Belvidere! One whom a maiden might for husband take! When she has married him the hundredth time That morning, conning o'er the ceremony, And, louder than the clerk gives out the psalm, Chanting obey!âA well-conducted maid! Spring on her lipsâa very backward Spring! And in her heart Midsummer!âOut upon it! The love, that knows 'tis justified, is wrong To hang its head, and droop its lids and make Its lips a jailer's porch that opes by halves, In constant watch of whom it may let outâ Sure token that delinquents bide within! 'Tis even as I say. My eager sire Has got his answer. She will none of me; Nor stops she there, but all the truth avows. Her heart is pledged to you!âShe will be wife To none, but Wilton Brown. Wilt. Declared she that? Sher. Yes; soon as urged thereon, From something stronger than a hint, the Duke In converse with my father dropp'd. Wilt. And gave The Duke no promise to enforce your suit? Sher. My father's suit, you mean! None, Wilton; but Excused himself on fair and valid groundsâ A pledge unto a dying mother given Ne'er to coerce her child's affections. Wilt. How Brooks my good lord your father, the o'erturn Of what he plann'd with so much care, and thought Beyond mischance assured? Sher. I fear to speak, When what I ought to speak lacks reverence, And to a name revered! Content thee, Wilton. Bethink thee of a heart o'erfraught with hate, Revenge, aught else in passion's murky list, And guess how brooks my father his balk'd wish! He will be here anon!âLook to the Duke! You may befriend him, and I know you would, Though now the let that keeps you from your hopes! Spin volumes out of hintsâand, Wilton, mind, Inquires my father how I bear myself On this reverse, you tell him I am spedâ Gone in the dumpsâin doubt to hang or drown; That horrid things I mumble to myself, Biting my nailsâportent of direst things; That I am clean distraught, and measure rather For a strait jacket than a coat and vest! A man, in brief, whose wits are out o' sorts; And so it is!âfor is it not enough To drive one mad, when one's content, with frets To try and make him more content? I hate A man to fill my cup till it runs o'er! Wilton, farewell!âReport me, if you love me, Not what I am, but what I should be.âMind, Keep eye on the well-being of the Duke! [Goes out. Wilt. There's danger toward the Duke. I do not blame His slight of me!âDid I not slight myself? Rebuke my love?âforbid my hopes to look For entertainment at their master's hands? Owe the Duke grudge? I bear ill-will to none; My heart is all astonishment and love. The Earl!âMy task. [Sits down.] Look to the Duke? I'll look To my own honourâthen is all assured! Enter Lord Byerdale. Lord Byer. Yes, I shall crush him there, where he will breakâ Crumble to dustâin his pride! The match was madeâ Conditions, quick as I propounded them, Accorded! Nothing wanting but consent, There where consent was duty! There!âupon The very threshold of completionâthere We stop and all's undone! She shall accept, In lieu of one who claims a noble stock, A mate without a name!âa spurious graft, For a fair scion!âfor a boast, a blush! And there he sits, at hand! His grace the Duke Is, in a net of his own weaving, caught; Complots with noted traitors, whose designs We yet but guess atâto whose haunts, to-night I'll have him dogg'd, and, thence as he returns, Arrested and committed to the Tower. Thus shall I strike one blow, but feather-light To one that is to come. My instrument! [Looking at Wilton. I have borne him hard! I loathe him for the blood I more than guess he shares with me! Too near He neighbours with the title and estates My brothers' timely deaths without attaint Have handed down to me. Conjecture, busy While yet a cast remains for chance to throw, Conjures up visions full of claims to come, On rights usurp'd, of which the wearer stripp'd, Is left as beggar bare! Not trustfully Men, wont to scowl, look sweet; yet show the wind, That turns foul weather all at once to fair, The wonder's gone. A reason will suffice. Wilton, good morning! Wilt. âWilton!â When before 'Twas ever Mr. Brown! Lord Byer. Wiltonâ Wilt. Again! Lord Byer. The soundest tree is still of slowest growth: Poplars shoot up to towers, while oaks are twigs. So loves and friendships vary just as trees; The quickest form'd are scarce the most robust. I am not one who gives his heart away Upon a fit of liking. I take time; Time is the test of truth. 'Tis many a day Since we knew one anotherâall which time I have thought muchâfelt muchâbut little said; And e'en that little churlishly enoughâ Morosely, may be.âWhat, though, if I say It went against the grain? It did so, Wilton. I oft have chid myself for slighting theeâ Tax'd myself roundlyâbut my after-thought Has ta'en my part; for who should nourish love While chance remains of sudden withering From some unknown, too late reveal'd defect? Thus have I kept aloof, but with the aim To know the thing, I wish'd to draw more near, That, once embracing it, the lock might last! I know thee now, and henceforth we are friends! Wilt. My lord!â Lord Byer. Enough! I guess what thou wouldst say; I know thy modest nature. Be assured Thou canst not teach me, there;âyet, it may be This seeming strange transition genders doubt. Wilt. My lord!â Lord Byer. I know you do not doubt me. Men, Single themselves, are always large of trust. I own I stand in need of some; but you Can give, and have to spare. You are a free, A most deserving, more foregoing man. Have I not seen your patience? Has it fail'd, And has it not been tried? Ay, has it, Wilton! Ay, to my shame, I would say, knew I not My heart, and the fair end it had in view. The end, at times, transforms the means, that what We pass'd in hate, our love looks back upon! Wilton, you ought to rise!âYou have the worth; The palm should come, and shall! Wilt. Alas!â Lord Byer. I say I know your modestyâand modesty Is that rare quality men most applaud But nourish least, because 'tis not its art To enrich itself. The wealthy and the high Are the world's idols. Wilton, you must rise, And then, have modesty, or have it not, You will be hugg'd! You have the merit, sir, But not the front; and, better have the front If you would make your way. There's not a week In the year but mere Pretension plays and wins, And Merit looking on, that knows the game, But doubts to take the cards! Do I not know, The very debts that men contract with you, So far from claiming, you have ever shunn'd The sight of those who owe them! Wilt. Debts, my lord? Lord Byer. Ay, debts! Wilt. I know of none. Lord Byer. Indeed! Why, then, The Duke of Gaveston and his daughter do! Moreover, as I learn, acknowledge them; Farther, would render paymentâOne, at least. I know the Lady Laura loves you, Wilton. Wilt. Forbear, my lord! O speak not lightly of A lady's love! It is her paramount Especial jewel, over which keep guard All things most rare in her tenacious sex; Its radiant truth; its fragrant chastity; Its goodness of the 'haviour of the heavens; Its modestyâenhancement of all theseâ Setting them off with veil more rare and rich Than ever needle broider'd, or the loom! If I were rich, my lord, as you would say, 'Twere scarce a theme for my rapt soul and me To enter on so freely! Lord Byer. You are worth Her love, and have it, Wilton! Nay, she makes No secret on't. Her father told me so; Founded thereon rejection of my son, Although with bitterness of gallÃ©d pride. Wilt. No wonder! He's a duke; and what am I? Lord Byer. Why, Wilton, not the humble man you think! Wilt. Again! You know the secret of my birth! [Rushing up to Lord Byerdale. Who were my parents!âO the loneliness To live and feel, unknowing whence we sprung! To bear most gratefully a heavy debt, Enjoying boundless reverence and love, Without a token of the benefactors We owe it to! My lord, you are a father,â You have a thought of what a son must feel In plight so blank as mine! Who were my parents?â Though they were peasants, tell me! All I want Is but to know to whom my yearning heart Has nature's right to cleave! That they are dead I know.âWho were they? Tell me, that I make Out of their memories, breathing, glowing things, To keep with me and cherish and revere! Lord Byer. Good Wiltonâ Wilt. Nay, you have the knowledge. Lord Byer. Yes. Wilt. Then tell me what you know!âYou would relieve A famish'd manâmy lord, I hunger more! Lord Byer. Be patient!âHear me!âNow is not the time; Content you, what I know you shall be told. Yet learn thus far:âYour veins are fraught with streams Were running rich ere those that fill the Duke's Were known to flow. Spare unavailing pains; To that thou hast the power to compass, give Your cares alone. The Lady Laura loves you; You covet her; you shall possess her, ay, With will of the proud Dukeâif notâwith suit! I tell thee, Wilton, he will seek thee soon, More heartily than he would shun thee now. Reckon on that thou hast within thy reach, And, as to other ventures, trust the winds!â They'll bring them home before you look for them. [Goes out. Wilt. More lightânot more content!âBetter be dark As ever.âBetter not to know a part, Than, knowing that, to have the rest withheld! Who halts at prospect of the pinnacle That gives him note his journey's end is nigh, Except with fever of inquietude? Way-gone and crippled, rather would he on, Than lay him down and rest another night. But I must rest, it seems, howe'er I can! The knowledge of my birth brings knowledge else He would withhold! Who has good news to tell And does not tell it out?âNay, if he stops, It is for something that undoes the whole! Conjecture's waste, that ends where it began! Yet must I on again, nor better speed! The Duke consent to mate his child with me? How?âWhen?âA reason?â'Tis deception all! He plays a part! Said not Lord Sherbrooke now His heart was fraught with malice 'gainst the Duke, And means he the Duke well?âHe loves not me, And does he mean me well? Tell me the Duke Will sue to me to wed his noble child! Oh, I would wed her!âbut will wed her never, Except with free and full consent of honour! [Goes out. SCENE II. âA Room in the Green Dragon. Sir George Barkley, Sir Richard Fenwick, Sir William Parkyn, Sir John Friend, Harrison, Charnock, and others, seated round a table, whereon there are papers and other implements for writing. They rise and come forward. Sir G. Bark. Sirs, 'tis the journey's end, without the toil, The chance, a thousand things that stop the way, On a long road, and cause the traveller To curse the setting outâfor what's the strife? Why, James, or William of Nassau!âAway With one of themâ'tis done! Sir R. Fen. It was the counsel I cleaved to all along. Sir W. Park. And I. The others. [Except Armstrong.] And all. Sir G. Bark. Which, had it been allow'd to take its course, Our hopes had been consummate now, instead Of things to question. 'Sdeath, sirs! men resolved To act, should on like men, and act at once, Not stop and gape about them! Arm. Colonel Greenâ Sir G. Bark. Who's that? I trust all here are friends! Arm. 'Twas I That spoke! Sir G. Bark. And what of Colonel Green? Arm. The plan Was liked by all but himâI meant to say No more. Sir G. Bark. The plan was liked by all but him! Who broke it to him? 'Tis for him to act, Not plot. He does not like the covert blow! No more do Iâno more does any man. But if one blow will save a million, strike, And never hang debating on the mode. The Colonel has seen serviceâ Arm. You say right. He's an old soldier and a gallant one! Sir G. Bark. Who does not know it?âWill you let me speak, And bide your timeâor, must you speak, speak on, But tell us something new! He is a soldier, And, would he mutter at an ambuscade? Or, never has he plann'd nor captain'd one? I warrant you!â'Twere news indeed to him To tell him war is free to stratagems; And says he it is peace? Why are we here, And others sitting in our easy chairs? Are not our own doors, sirs, thy very last We dare to knock at? Are we the King's men, And sits another on our master's throne? The fight is over! Is it?âAy!âindeed, While in their sheaths our rapiers restless lie! Before a month an army's in the field, And is it peace? Sir R. Fen. You are warm! Sir G. Bark. I own I am. Sir J. Friend. We are all agreed. Sir G. Bark. But others should be here. Where is the Duke of Gaveston? Sir R. Fen. Have you broach'd The purport of our meeting to his grace? Sir G. Bark. No; for his grace is like a restive horse, Given to back at startingâfree enough, If once he's made to go. Lead him by the head A little, and he'll progress. Sir W. Park. Hark! a step! Sir G. Bark. See who it is!âWho is it? Sir W. Park. 'Tis the Duke. Enter the Duke of Gaveston. Sir G. Bark. Your grace is welcome, though the hour rebukes Your punctuality. Duke of Gav. Nay, Sir George Barkley, The most assurÃ©d purpose must resign The mastery to chance! My coach broke down. Sir W. Park. His grace is full in time. Sir G. Bark. I do not mean To blame his graceâbut a conspirator Is one who sails in treacherous latitudes, Where tempests give no warning, but blow up The waves at once; where, while you look at him, The sun goes out, and all the heaven is wrack; And thunders bellow the next minute only, To that when scarce the ripple at the bow Whisper'd the vessel's course. So I mistrust, Yet cause see none to fear. Possess the Duke Of what we have debated and resolved. [The Duke retires with Sir W. Parkyn. Sir J. Friend. [Aside to Sir G. Barkley.] His grace is potent; what if he demur? Sir G. Bark. [Aside to Sir J. Friend.] He will demur!âobserve his grace's looks! He likes not foreign aid!âThat frets the grain. He will not sail with us if he can help; But he's aboard and we command the ship! 'Tis but âUp anchor,â and we scud along! The cloud again, but darker! Duke of Gav. [Coming forward.] Never, sirs! 'Gainst foreign aid I enter, come what may, My protest. If we cannot right ourselves, We'll bear our wrongs, and let our brothers have The day, howe'er unjustly, rather than Commit ourselves and them into the hands Of the natural enemy!âand as for him Who has usurp'd the throne, as we aver, Why, let him keep it, if to strike him thence Needs the assassin's arm! The noblest cause Were damn'd to seek success by means so foul! The field, sirs, if you will!âI am with you there; But not in a conspiracy like this, Befitting men who make a trade of bloodâ Abhorr'd of those who hire them! Sir G. Bark. You are quick In making up your mind to draw your stakes! You are in the game, and must abide the deal. Duke of Gav. Must, sir! Sir G. Bark. Plain speech fits best, in grave affairs! Sirs, we are like to mariners escaped A founder'd ship, in open boat at sea; The will of the majority is law, He who demurs to which goes overboard! Here are our measures stated; whereunto Want but our signatures as evidence For one and all, that all committed stand! Come; while this solemn act proceeds, unsheath. [They draw. His grace, in point of right, precedence takes. Duke of Gav. I will not sign, sirs, neither draw my sword. Sir G. Bark. [Grasping the Duke's wrist.] Nay, my lord Duke, you must. Col. Green. [Entering.] Good even, sirs! A wonted guest may come unbidden. Sir G. Bark. Green! Who let you in? Col. Green. Who durst not keep me out. And if he could, what is the use of doors When councils are not close?âYou talk too much, Good Sir George Barkley! Since I thwarted you A month ago in these same measures, which, To carry through, you now convene your friends, You have boasted fifty times, by this and that, To divers hearers, and in divers haunts, You'd bring your plans to bear; in which, I grieve, Others, that should know better, side with you. But not with you my business. Sir G. Bark. Whom besides? Col. Green. The Duke of Gaveston. But that he were here, I had not come. He is refractory; I said he would be so, and I am glad; For prophets like to see their words come true. Good Sir George Barkley!â Sir G. Bark. Sir? Col. Green. You make too free With his grace's sleeve! So please you, let it go. Sir G. Bark. Who abets treachery? Sir J. Friend and others. None here! Col. Green. Well said, Assassination! Well said, the allies Of the common enemy!âthe gentlemen Who plan when William next should hunt the stagâ A masquerade, wherein the foreign bravo Should don the British sportsman's jovial gear, Who gives the game a chance!âwho undertake To give kind welcome to a force from Franceâ Suffer her skipping sons to flourish here Weapons that never left their scabbards yet, Except with threat against a British throat! Who abets treachery? So!âSir George Barkley, hear you? I say, once more, let go his grace's sleeve! I wish a word with him. Sir G. Bark. Is't not enough We are gainsaid?âshall we be bearded tooâ Our weapons in our hands? Col. Green. Beware, the first Who stirs to strike. Though many look one way, All are not of one mind. Good Sir George Barkley, You should know better! Men, in counting friends, May chance to overlook a foe or two. Before you call a game of swords, behoves You make sure of the sides. Moreover, sir, The wisest man counts most upon himself, As I, you see, have done! [Throws back his cloak, and shows himself provided with pistols, &amp;c. Beware, Sir George, For pistols make reports!âreports are heard! Triggers are quick! and, if the priming burns, Why then, in an old hand, is powder dust! I have a sword besides, that's used to odds, As more than one can vouch! Come, Sir George Barkley, Let go the Duke this minute, or the next A bullet's through your head!âYou know I mark Whenever I take aim! [Sir George Barkley releases the Duke. That's courteous, sir! Your grace will please to leave my frontage clear, And step a pace behind me. Now, Sir George, A minute's parley, if you will. Char. We treat You fairly; wherefore do you thwart us thus? Col. Green. You treat me fairly! Hear you, Sir George Barkleyâ I speak to you, sir, you! the head of those Who treat me fairly! Sir, you hatch'd this plot Without my privity! Was that fair? It Was wiseâI should have crush'd it in the hatching! You warn'd me hold myself in readiness, With ten of those who follow me, to back you In the enterprise, but never once let out The nature on't,âWas that fair? It was prudent: The breath, you breathed it in, had been your last one! A friendâI have someâput me on my guard. I was to learn hereafter! when I stood Unwittingly committed in the fact! And yet he tells me I am treated fairly! And had it come to pass, sure as you hear me, Straight to the block had I given up myself, And dragg'd you thither with me, one and all! Sir G. Bark. Design you to betray us? Col. Green. No; that's truth; But I'll defeat your plans!âThat's truth again! Your names I ne'er divulge! Your heads are safe, For any hint that I shall give the axe! Arm. He is a man of honourâfear him not. Sir G. Bark. But I do fear him. Col. Green. Do, and reap the fruit! A craven spirit scared without a cause! Sir G. Bark. We should not let him go. Col. Green. Nay, but you should. Sir G. Bark. Wherefore? Col. Green. Because you must. Good even, friends! Be what you were, when I made one among you,â Soldiers!âI hold not compact with assassins! Trust to yourselves!âMake not allies of foes! For him who owns the throne, another fills, Array the honourable, open field, Then call me traitor if I show not there! Pray move not from your placesâWe can find The stairs without your helpâwhich, trust me, sirs, Were pains that scarcely would repay themselves; And so I take my leave.âA kind good night! [The Duke and Colonel Green go out. The others draw into a knot in the back of the stage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Room in Kensington Palace. Enter Colonel Green and a Page. Col. Green. My business will not stay, sir! 'Tis direct And urgent. It is done this very hour, Or not at all. Your own discretion use; But using it, remove all blame from me. The council sits; and, as you say, no doubt On grave affairs; but graver bring me hither. So tell Lord Portland. Page. May I crave your name? Col. Green. No, sir; my business is my name; and that I tell to none but him. Page. He scarce will grant An audience to an unknown visitor. Col. Green. And, if I give my name, I am unknown. What then, sir? Do you know me? No. To you Or him, I give what name I please; but, save My own, I shall give none, and that, so please you, I will not give. My business is of moment!â Instant in matter vital to the king: That, for your warrant to perform my wish. Yet something farther. Tell his lordship, one Whose life he saved, craves speech with him. The Boyne Will help his memory as to time and place. An officer dismounted in the rout, Who would not ask his life from swords, enow To give discomfort to a wavering troop:â His lordship saw my plightâcall'd off the dogs, And saved the game, at bay! He'll recollect, Else is his memory shorter, sir, than mine; For I shall ne'er forget it till I die! Now may I trust you'll pleasure me? Page. I shall. [Goes out. Col. Green. No man is bound when evil counsels warp Those he contracted with on honest grounds. There's the default of combinations. Men Respect the compact more than they love truth. Keep it together when 'tis crack'd and flaw'd With rank defect, through folly creeping in, Cunning or crime; and ought to fall to pieces! Brand me a traitor!âsay I am forsworn!â If I must hold with men, or lose the grasp Of mine own soul! Away the allegation That flouts the laws of manâmocks those of Heaven! My honour's dear content is cheaply kept At loss of the whole world!âConscience is all! But let me not forget the leaguer'd Duke, Now in the toils of some close enemyâ Belike the Earl of Byerdale.âRevenge For the rejection of the son! 'Twas strange They captured him, yet laid not hand on me. Herein his case I have in full set forth, And pleaded, as his bearing warranted, For Wilton's sake. No friend of mine is he! Enter the Page, conducting in the King. Page. This is the person. King. So!âYou may withdraw. [Page retires. I recollect him! though twelve years might serve A longer memory for plea to lose A trace of one beheld but once, and then In wrack of tempest. Yes; it is the man! Though by his air, more than his person known. He knows not me. Report, that gatherer Of all that comes to handâwhich oft picks up Falsehood as truthâhas pass'd another for me. Your business, sir? Col. Green. See I at last the man To whom I owe my life? King. You see that man. Col. Green. And, if I do, first let me say to him My debt, although long due, was ne'er forgot; And though to pay it I am bankrupt, save In gratitude, yet that has known no waste From lapse of time; but still has grown and grown, Till now my heart, half-bursting with its fraught, Has scarce the power to lay it down before him! King. [Aside.] A man of generous nature well as brave! Myself befriended, I befriending you! I recollect you; though the veil which years Casts o'er the face, they have had time to weave. I recollect you, sir! A gallant man Is scarce forgotten by his brother, though At odds with himâespecially when seen In strait that proves him mettle to the core! Such as beleaguer'd you. I am very glad You 'scaped the further hazard of the day, And live in health to this. Col. Green. O, my good lordâ King. Your business, pray you? Col. Green. If I speak of one, You serve and reverence, by a title, less Than that you name him by, forgive a man Who having been the subject of a king Who had a throne, pays him allegiance now Without one! King. Sir, I understand you. Spare Excuses! Save compunction! We shall speak Of William of Nassau. What you would say Refers to him? Col. Green. His safety! King. Ay! Col. Green. His life! King. His life is in High Hands, sir, and to those He trusts it! Col. Green. Those who do not fear such hands Are arm'd against his life. King. Sir, every day Is rife with rumoursâevery day we hear Of plots a-hatching, ready to start up; Yet day succeeds to day and nothing stirs To cost a wink of sleep!âThe King's at ease Or, if it please you,âWilliam of Nassau! Col. Green. Your lordship will compel me say the âKing,â If for my feelings thus you tax your own; And, yet, I should not say it. King. Nothing say But what you should say. What's the danger, sir, You hint at? Col. Green. What I know on better ground Than simple rumour! What with my own eyes I have seenâhave heard with mine own earsâhad been A party to, but that, at the first blush, My soul revolted at the treason! King. Treason To William of Nassau! Col. Green. To mine own honour! King. I thought, sir, 'twas the life of such a man I saved! Go on! Col. Green. Ere I proceed, I have A boon to askânay, a condition. King. Well! Say a condition, 'tis accorded!âName it. Col. Green. Not to be importunedâfar less requiredâ To divulge a single name!âfor they are mates I hitherto made common cause withâbrothers In honourable ventureâbonded with me By wear of sinew and by waste of blood. If I defeat the guilt, it is enough; I'll not betray the guilty, come what may! King. It is enough! Col. Green. But further yet, my lord; If aught transpire to bring to perfect light The plot with its contrivers, I shall stand Aloof!âno evidence of mine be call'd To fix the penalty on the accusedâ And though it were, I should be mute, and keep My silence steadfast to the very block. King. I think you would!âHave all that you demandâ My honour is impledged! And now the peril? Col. Green. Assassination! King. That is a base pass For your king's cause to come to! Col. Green. On my soul He knows it not! Did he, upon the same Immortal, irrecoverable pledge, If forfeitedâhe would denounce it, though It cost frustration of his regal hopes! King. [After a pause.] You are a loyal man!âWhat farther, sir, Concerning William of Nassau? Unless You throw some farther light, he's struck before He sees the blow. Col. Green. To-morrow he will dine With my Lord Romneyâ King. Ay?âBehoves our William He whisper his engagements with his friends! Well? Col. Green. He will be beset with twice the sum Of his accustom'd guards. King. That's matter, sir: Proceed. Col. Green. On Saturday, towards ten at night, He is like to pass 'cross Turnham Green. King. Indeed! A worse than bootless journey saved perhaps, Or taken at more charge of retinue! Aught else? Col. Green. If they are baffled there, he hunts; And, on some breathing-day, they will take care To turn out such a field that Death himself Shall ride along with him. King. They go to work In earnest! Col. Green. O, my lord! Protect your king! Counsel him to be wary! Hedge him round With safety thickly!âthickly, my good lord! For your own sakeâfor your fair country's sake, That loathes the secret stabâNay for his own! For he is braveâa thousand miles above A foul and dastard death!âan upright prince! As all allowâeven his enemies! Grateful to those who serve himâmeaning well, Even in the act which I and many more Traverse and bear with blameâAlthough to him I ne'er owe fealty, nor bend the knee, Norâ King. Stop!âyou are in error all along; Which, with your leave, I now will set to rights. 'Tis not the lord of Portland talks with you; 'Twas not the lord of Portland saved your life; His squadrons William of Nassau awhile In person led. He saw you, thick beset; He heard the death or quarter proffer'd you; The latter, point at throat, you would not ask!â The first, were readyâlike a cavalier Whose soul was in the cause he battled for And saw was lostâto take! He stopp'd the thrust Saw you remount, and order'd you free way! You say it was a debtâwell; be it so! But, if it was, 'tis amply, now, repaid; And take acquittance full, and thanks, to boot, From William of Nassau! Col. Green. The king!âMy life Your highness' gift!âThen 'tis your highness' due, And on my knee, I tender it! King. Indeed!â I did not look for this. Col. Green. I know it, sire! And, therefore, tender't the more heartily. King. Rise, pray you! Teach me how I am to name you. You hesitate!âEnough!âTake your own time And opportunity. I shall expect To hear from you.âNay, since you give me rightâ Command you, that you, then, apprise me fully Touching the knowledge which I now forego! And now, good morning, sir. If I have found A subject, well!âif notâyou have found a friend! Col. Green. A king! my liege. King. Then, sir, the better friend! Col. Green. O, yet vouchsafe, my liege, another moment: One who his life imperill'd yesternight, Discountenancing foulest treachery, Was in my presence by your messenger Arrested, and, as truly I believe, Not upon public but base private groundsâ The Duke of Gaveston. King. Ay!âI know the Duke Affects another's cause; but, by my crown, I hold him as an open enemy, And bear no grudge to him.âConcerns that scroll The Duke? Col. Green. [Presenting the scroll.] It does. King. I shall peruse it, sir, And when I know the man who gave it meâ As now do hold you bound to let me know himâ Declare my judgment on it. Col. Green. Yet, my liege, Another moment.âDeem me not a man Who loosely cleaves! Had I been such a one, I had been shaken off by slights, neglects, Short-comings, and offences, long ago! Nay, farther,âthink not 'tis my personal Peculiar debt alone determines me I' the transfer of my duty; for of late, I have begun to see, despite my wish, Another good, neglected formerly, Incorporated with the regal weal In your more equal, patriotic sway. I say't with pain of heart, yet hearty faith, And, to assert it, henceforth draw my breath. [They go out severally. SCENE II. âLord Byerdale's Library. Wilton discovered sitting. He comes forward. Wilt. Hope! ready promiser, unsure performer, Unequal architect, that builds the mole, Which breaks the mountain billows into spray; Or fabrics fragile, as the gossamer's, That come and vanish with the dews of morn; Bitter betrayer, yet sweet counsellor, Voucher believed, with thousand broken oaths! Friend false, yet, for a fair face, trusted stillâ Why do I listen to thee? Joyful dream, That turns out, oft, on waking, blank despair, Why do I trust thy visions, and dream on, Gazing on the good I never may enjoy? Yet art thou blest so farâThe naked wretch Goes clad by thee, the whileâthe hungry feasts! The wobegone forget their tears and smile! The greater part of being is fill'd up With solace by thee, and the load, that else Would break the back, is borne with patience still! Thou art the anodyne which lulls the pang, That should not chide thee, though it wakes again! The stimulant which breaks the lethargy, Which, though it close on us again, thou robb'st Of so much being, else were swallow'd up! Thou art a good, although a doubtful one, And, wanting thee, this fitful course of life Were never half run through! I'll deal with thee! But, yet, with question; so, by thy default I suffer less, and, if thou keep'st thy word, Lose nothing of the gain thou promisest! Enter Williams. Will. A lady, sir, would speak with you. Wilt. A lady?â With me?âConduct her in. [Williams goes out. What sympathy Lives 'twixt my heart and hers that comes, that thus I am all alarms? [Williams re-enters, conducting in Lady Laura veiled. Withdraw. [Williams goes out. Wilton offers a chair, which is declined. Will you not sit? [She declines again. Madam, your will? Lady Lau. The fullest credit, sir, A gentlewoman in unwonted strait, Compelling her to slight allowÃ©d forms, May challenge at a man of honour's hands. Wilt. [Aside.] The voice is hersâher lineaments and form Her air betrays, which none could mock so well, As to deceive the eye, instructed once How symmetry and beauty bear themselves United in one costly paragon! Lady Lau. A tardy answer speaks a doubtful suit; The boon we wish to grant is graced at once! I blush enough, believe me, at my boldness, To need to blush at your rebuff as well. Wilt. [Rushing up to her and taking her hand.] It must be you! Lady Lau. [Throwing back her veil.] Wilton, 'tis I!â [Wilton offers to kneel.] Forbear. Nay, keep your feet. Knee give me none, save that Obedience bends! I know not reverence Of shows and words!âI challenge none at all! Why should I?âI, that poorly have upheld My maiden state! or am I, all-forgot? And did you woo me long?âprotest your love A thousand times ere I would lend an ear? Sue me with sighs as thick as winter gusts, To win a breath of faint encouragement? Besiege each access to my chary love, My pity, pride, trust, generosity, Till heart of stone could not withstand the dint Of such enforcement, and, to yield, became A grace in most unquestion'd modesty? Didst thou all these, or any one of these? Orâwas I cheaper than a peasant won, That's found not, save by seeking? Wilt. Ladyâ Lady Lau. Lady! Ay; I have borne myself most loftily! Maintain'd my sex's rights with most high hand! I thought I had!âIf I had met you, Wilton, In a gay ball, I should have pass'd you by With eye withdrawn soon as it lit on you; For face and form of man I ne'er perused, So was I wont to pore upon the spirit That makes the high romantic in your sex; But when I mark'd your visage kindling up With all that prompts what chivalry enacts, As, single to my foes you stood opposedâ A bastion 'twixt aggression and the weakâ Comely and stately! garrison'd by proof Of valour, truth, and generosity, The vision, which, from girlhood e'en till then, My soul had raised, embodied stood before me, And all my woman's nature clung to thee! Wilt. What mean your words? Something is wrong! What is it? Lady Lau. All's wrong!âA maid should be an icicle, Yielding but drop by dropâand then with chilling Cold to the last! Melting, not of herself, But 'gainst her nature!âthen she's worth the thawing! Frankness in her is not a virtue, or 'Tis one that will undo her! She should go Without a heart!âIt is her poverty To have one! Men aver they prize her for't; But when they find she has one, and 'tis theirs, They care for't, as for that they cast away! Wilt. And if your heart is mine, my dearest hopes Were with it cast away. Lady Lau. Your dearest hopes! They are no longer hopes!âYou are sure of them! Wilt. Madam! Lady Lau. Ay, madam! My Lady Laura Gaveston!âthe Duke's daughter! Tell me the truth! Have I not play'd my part Most poorly? With most abject, paltry spirit? O, but a maid's in an extremity That tells her love! But do me justice, sir; Or hear me justify myself! I saw you Of humble rank, but thought your nature noble Beyond enhancing by a thousand patents! I saw that you affected meâyou did so! But that, what the mere name of rank had loosed Its essence tiedâyour tongue.âI spoke, because You could not speakâspoke for myself, I own, But for myself, because I spoke for you; Else, never!âI had wither'd to a shroud, And all had wonder'd how! With but my heart You might have staid content, as I with yours, My hand, have left to chance! It was not fair To win it in a strait, without advice Or hint! No will of mine consulted!ââYea,â Or âNay,â a cipher!âno more option than A bargain bought and sold! Yours will I be, But how? With all my heart? No, Wilton!âGo Not back for what I speak!âI will be thineâ It must be, but alas! how fall'n in pride! How shamed beyond endurement! how betray'd! How jarr'd in loveâfor O, I love you still! How broken in content at prospering!â How balk'd in all made hope of union sweet! Wilt. How comes this ruin where I nothing see That's flaw'd, far less gives way?âO lady!â Lady Lau. Peace! Enough! To-night we wed. Wilt. We wed to-night! Lady Lau. Whence all this wonder where there's nothing new? Wilt. All's new to me! All strange that you aver,â The last most strange of all! Lady Lau. And know you naught Touching the Earl? Wilt. [Recollecting himself.] The Earl! Lady Lau. You recollect!â Your wander'd thoughts come home! Wilt. I see it all! Something has been transacted which you think I have lent aidance to,âwith which my wish, You think, has gone along, or my consent! I am clear as your unquestionable self In each of these respects! The Earlâ Lady Lau. Go on!â There is the shoal that wrecks me, or, escaped, Sees me at anchor with a freight to scorn An argosie!âGo on!â Wilt. What you aver Shall come to pass, he told me should arrive. Lady Lau. But not the means?âWilton, if yet I doubt, It is with yearning for the clearing up, That brightness may be perfectânot a wreath To flit across the welkin of my hopes,â But sun! all sun!âBut not the means? Wilt. No! Lady Lau. No? I am thy wife to-night! At ten to-night I plight thee troth for troth! Wilt. Where? Lady Lau. Bless thee for That question! Wilt. Where? Lady Lau. Again? Nor once too oftâ O my tenacious soul, not pleased enough With proof on proof, but grasps at more and more. Where?âGuess! Wilt. Thy father's house? Lady Lau. My father's jail! Wilt. His jail! Lady Lau. The Tower! Nay, do not gasp; and yet Didst thou not, Wilton, I should stint for breath, I should not heed, though ne'er again I drew! Forgive me! Clear thou nothing know'st! Forgive me! [Kneels to Wilton. Wilt. Rise! Lady Lau. To thy arms I willâmy pardon seal'd! Wilt. [Raising her.] O, hope outdoneâreality undream'd. Lady Lau. Listen, lest opportunity be gone, My father on a charge of treason bides A pris'ner in the Tower. These are times When not men's reasons, but their passions, fill The judgment-seat; wherefore, it oft goes hard With innocence itself. The axe alone Is sure of its rights, and those, and more, it gets; And takes them sudden quick!âAh, Wilton!âWell!â This knows my fatherâthis the Earl has urged: Has plann'd evasion of, and will afford; Upon condition that the hour which sets My father free, shall see his child in bonds She'll wear with all her heartâput on by thee! Forbear! I know thy thoughts!âSpeak not!âHear mine! It must be!âMore a maiden should not say! Yet wherefore?âLove that's not ingenuous Does not deserve and should abjure the name! Whate'er the motives of the subtle Earl, Let it be, Wilton, for my father's sake! If not for his sake, let it be for thine! If that lacks cogency, for my sake, then! [Knocking. Listenâa summons at the portal!âWilton, Pay me no tendance as I leave the house; Let me go forth as I were nobody! Thou'lt do my bidding? Wilt. Yes. Lady Lau. Thy word's my soul! At ten to-night, thou wedd'st me in the Tower! [Goes out. Wilt. With faculties more lapsed, ne'er vision left The rapt beholderâvanishing, while yet His soul was on the strain, where tension stops, Or snaps! Belief at once recoils, and trusts; Questions the senses, with their evidence Distinct and strong as e'er defied disproof! Asks âIs it so?â and answer'd to content Of reason, starts a doubt, and asks again, Without a ground save its own strange amaze! Give loose to joy, and welcome Fortune, though Her visit is unlook'd for, and she comes With face all bright, where scarce you hoped a smile! The Earl?âWhy, how is this?âWhy breaks he up The goodly company of my fair thoughts, That fly at his approach! Lord Byer. [Entering.] Wilton, good news! I would have been the harbinger, but find A friend has been beforehand with meâstill I say âGood news!â and give thee hearty joy! The Lady Laura weds thee, boy, to-night; And hence you bear her! Said I not, good Wilton, It should be so? And that it is so, take The warrant of the Duke.â [Gives a paper. You have his child's; I met her as I enter'd. Sooth, she well Affects thee!âa fair bride, and free as fair! See how her father makes thee full amends For all the slight he show'd thee. Wilt. [Reading.] From the Tower? Lord Byer. Ay, Wilton. He would meddleâtake a partâ In the game arch-traitors playâThe cards were struck From his hands, though scarce in time to save the stake, His lifeâwhich he must owe to thee.âYou read? Wilt. I do, my lord. Lord Byer. He speaks his wishes plainly? Wilt. He does. Lord Byer. And urgently? Wilt. And urgently. Lord Byer. I said it should be so. Wilt. You didâbutâ Lord Byer. But!â Do you demur? Well?âWhat?âIs the Duke to die? Wilt. I would but askâ Lord Byer. You would but askâ Wilt. My lord!â Lord Byer. Ask nothing when your wish is at the door! But welcome it, lest, if you shut it out, It ne'er may come again! I have done my best, And brook not questioning. Are you content, Or are you not? If not, no harm is done To you; and, for the Duke he must abide The issue whereto you abandon him! Speaks the Duke plainly? Wilt. Yes. Lord Byer. The lady said That you stood bound to her to do his will. Good sooth, it cost no effort, I should think! Why start a hindrance now? Wilt. I started none: I onlyâ Lord Byer. Only is too muchâoffence My honour will not brook. You doubt the meansâ I know you do.âDoubt on, and lose the end! The actor vouches for the act, and scorns Interpretationsâwhich come gracelessly From those he means to serve! I am content; Let that suffice!âIf not, why let it pass! And on good fortune turn the thankless back. Wilt. I am not unthankful. Lord Byer. No? Then close at once; And, without more ado, with what's proposed: Do you? Wilt. I do. Lord Byer. Your honour to't! Wilt. 'Tis given. Lord Byer. Take in exchange the bridegroom's joy to-night, Who at the altar clasps the maid he loves In that embrace, which fathers can't unlock. I'll write a word or two. [Sits and writes. Wilt. I feel as one Who walks 'midst quicksands, and at every step Fears to be swallow'd up. My heart misgivesâ Tells me some gulf's at handâyet must I on! Lord Byer. This gives you entrance to the Tower, and this Egress with whom you will. I'll wait you here. Ten is the hour. The chaplain of the fortress Has been bespoken, and will tie the knot Quickly and fast. Prepare you for love's voyage; Hence shall you hie to ship! Fair winds attend you!â Wilt. O, yet a word, my lordâNo doubtâa boon, Touching myself alone! You said my blood Was richly nobleâtell me who I am! Lord Byer. [After a pause.] I will, upon condition of an oath. Wilt. Propound it. Lord Byer. That what I divulge you'll keep Strict from your mistress and the Duke, until His prison walls are pass'd. It alters naught Which ought to stand.âThou art of noble bloodâ Wilt. Am I?âI give my oath. Lord Byer. [Aside.] I nothing risk! It is a triumph which invites me now, And longer to delay were misery. Wilt. O speak, my lord! Lord Byer. I see you burn to know. Wilton, we share one blood. Wilt. My gracious lord! Lord Byer. I am your uncle!â Wilt. If my dutyâ Lord Byer. Nay; I claim no duty from you! You are e'en My eldest brother's son. Wilt. His son, my lord! Lord Byer. But not his heir.âThere was a bar to that! Wilt. A bar! What bar? Lord Byer. Your mother bless'd his bed; But not that bed, the priestâShe loved and fell! Wilton, I have kept my word!âKeep thou thy oath! [Goes out. Wilt. Monster!âO, double malice! Hate 'gainst me! Revenge against the Duke!âBoth in the clutch Of his most devilish craft! The Duke with life In jeopardyâwhich but these nuptials save! The terms of liberty, which, till he gains, My lips are seal'd. No option left him, thus, Betwixt disgrace and death! With branded brow Espouse his trusting honourable child! Swear in the very act of such betrayal, To love and cherish her! Myself a monster, Save I incur the blight of perjury! Dilemma hideous and inextricable! Guidance! Help! Succour! Where shall they be found? [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Street. Enter Wilton Brown and Lord Sherbrooke. Wilt. Counsel me, Sherbrooke! I am past advice Or aidance from myself!âa man in bondsâ Imprison'dâone whose substance goes to rack On a nefarious plea, which but his face Would quash, and he's restrain'd from showing it! Sher. Collect your thoughts! Be more yourself! Wilt. I cannot! To Lady Laura stand I pledged, to-night To change my troth with hers before the priest! Thy father's bondsman am I, further yet, Until that league of love I implement; And further still, the Duke's life hostage held, Which, if I know him, he would forfeit sooner Than suffer a polluted stream to mix With the pure current of his costly blood; Yet there debarr'd of option, by my oath To keep my secret till his liberty Is by his own undoing perfected. What's to be done? Sher. What is a man to do That's in the grasp of stronger men than he, But go along with them? Scruples that can't Avail, should never chafe! What I should do, And could, I would do; but, the power away, The crime of the omission is away! Our parentage is not of our own choice, So its discredit to its framers stick, Not us; and hang the world that makes it ours! Sooth, though the banns had never been proclaim'd, I had been still the goodly youth I am; The same engaging featuresâshapely formâ Right gallant carriageâgirth and height without Abatement of the matter of an inch! The same bold, merry heart, and pranksome wit; Yea, I believe my blood had been the same, The same my hair and skin! Tut, Wilton! men Should answer for themselves, and live and breathe In others' 'count by their own deeds alone! Wilt. A friend that knew my wishes and my strait, Might, of his own accord, effect for me What mocks my faculty! Sher. And if he did, How might you thank him by-and-by? No, sir; I live in hopes to be a god-father, And can't forego the chance. I would enjoy, Moreover, the bride's customary bountyâ The blushing kiss, I, else, may never get; Besides, I wish the race to multiply! It is a matter that concerns the state, And I, a loyal subject, should not thwart. Then I have thoughts, myself, of matrimony, Although an indefinable mistrust, And so would profit, like a thorough friend, By your experiment. 'Sdeath! would you spoil The chance of such a Benedict as I? Wilt. Sherbrooke, you jest; and honour is in question! Sher. And if it were, Wilton, I should not jest, But set you free at thraldom of my life. Look you; you blush to share my blood! Go to! I would the share were double what it is! I would you were my brother! Were you, and With like discrepancy, my thrice-bound love, Being the man of merit that you are, Had, more than even, made the faultless odds! Wilt. The friend that soothes me tells me what I am, Plain as the enemy that bears me hard! I wear a branded name. Sher. No name's a brand When Virtue is the wearer! Wilt. I must seek A sterner counsellor! Sher. Then come with me To Colonel Green. No question! If there lives The man to help you, he's the very man. More could I tell youâwhat shall soon be known. Give me my way in this, then take your own! SCENE II. âA Room in the Green Dragon.âColonel Green discovered with papers. Col. Green. Why, this is granting favours like a king! My case was all I stated; and the suit I might, with doubt, have founded thereupon, His clemency has of itself inferr'd, And to his bounty pleaded royally! One deed of grace has swept all acts awayâ All penalties; and, in their place, supplied Freedom and honour; nor to me alone, But those I cherish closer than myself. One only boon I ask'dâthat granted too; Enlargement of the Duke, assoil'd by me. Thus, Wilton, from the net wherein the Earl Thinks he has mesh'd him, is, at once, set free! Why comes he not? Sherbrooke would see him straightâ That goodly sample of the choice and few Who love so heartily another's weal, In following it, they overlook their own. Steps! it is he. Enter Wilton. I have expected you. Wilt. So was I told; and I am here. Col. Green. At last. I gave you invitation long before, Which, in the way of common courtesy, You might have honour'd; gave you hint, beside, Of knowledge which concern'd youâwhich, to gain, A visit might suffice. Wilt. I know too much! Col. Green. Not so. You must know more. Wilt. Time flies! Col. Green. It does! But trust and fortune match its utmost speed! Wilt. The first I have, the second have to find. Col. Green. It may be nearer than you count. Wilt. How, sir? Col. Green. It may be close at hand. Heaven will send help When man believes to look for it is vain. You trust in Heaven? Wilt. I have no other trust! Col. Green. [Giving a paper.] There! Wilt. How!âThe liberation of the Duke! Can I believe it? Col. Green. Can you doubt it? Fresh!â And from the king's own hand. Wilt. God save the king! Col. Green. Now, have you leisure for a word or two? Wilt. Twenty, if spoken quicklyâfor my soul Is on the wing to thwart iniquity, And do a righteous deed. Col. Green. The instrument That paper?âHow will you employ it? Wilt. Set The Duke at liberty; and, then, the spot That blurs me laying open to the day, Release him from his promise to the Earl, Forego his daughter's hand, and, as I may, Buffet the world with shamed, but manly front! Col. Green. Fathers, young man, are hardly in their graves When, from their children, thus, their spirits breathe! Wilt. Knew you my father? Col. Green. Yes; of him I'd speakâ Not muchâof one he loved, a little more. I chanced to be the nearest friend of bothâ I mean, the heart-friend. Have you patience? Wilt. Ask When you observe me fail! Col. Green. [Having placed chairs for himself and Wilton.] Your father died In battle, fighting for the banish'd king! His brotherâ Wilt. What! the Earl? Col. Green. No; he had two, Of whom the Earl was but the younger one. I speak of the elder. Death, that struck your father, Miss'd him; and, as in spite at his escape, Left him almost a broken heartâfor much He loved your father! Well; the fight was o'er; The second brother bann'dâflight was his chance; But you, an infant, must be left behind Without a friend.âHe linger'd still for you; For well he knew his younger brother's wardâ For reasons, now to tell were waste of timeâ Had more of danger than of safety in't. Still had he motives for soliciting That brother's aidâa purse without a doit!â He sought it. It was granted readily; For in succession, failing you, he stood Next to his elder brother. Wilt. He was next. I was, alas! no barâI say âalas!â But for the cause.âIt had rejoiced my soul That elder brother had been heir to all! Col. Green. Again your father speaks.âLet me go on! Time flies. Wilt. I heed not time!âI list to you! Col. Green. Means were supplied. Upon the western coast, One lowering night, both brothers stood with you; Your hand in his who loved you as his son! A barque was in the offing, heavily Riding at anchor, bound that night to sail; A boat was waitingâ Wilt. Ah!âI recollect That father-uncle!âHe leap'd into it With me in his arms! Col. Green. Yes; while his brother stood And utter'd no dissuasion, though the waves, Warning the shore with louder waxing swell, Gave token that the sea was rousing up; Though the rough wind advised him of its mood, Bawling against you, as to turn you back; Though from your eyes the sun, just setting, hid, As if averse to tempt you with a look; Though on the land sat gloom and doubt and dread, As though it cried âGod help you!âânot âGod speed!â There stood that brother, like a barren rock, Above the shingles, that were following you With clamour, like rough friends, but kind, that wail âGood byeâ to those they doubt to see again! Wilt. We did not reach the ship! Col. Green. 'Twas well!âShe sank With every soul on board.âIt was not meant That you should reach her, though 'twas thought you did, By those who wish'd you partners of her fate. Your course was changed advisedly; the land Was made again, though many miles away; Distance was safety to you!âAsk no more. Hands for your fosterage, on which you held Some claims of blood upon your mother's side, Your uncle sought; but, reaching found them cold, Not in defection towards you, but in death. They were proud ones!âThe proudest must shake hands With Death at last! Wilt. Then was my mother of A noble stock? Col. Green. She was. Inquire as yet No more. Thy uncle was no guardian for theeâ Unsafe the ward of plots and enterprisesâ Heaven sent a friend at last!âhe gave you to him. The nobleman who train'd you, Wilton, till You grew the man you areâwho placed you with The Earl, who never half-redeem'd his pledge To see your fortunes better'dâbut, beholding Your father's face in yours, gave credit to The elements for ruth he grudged them have, And through inquiries, back'd by power and gold, Proved his surmises true. Wilt. Speak not of him! But tell me of that uncleâhow fared he? Col. Green. Remain'd an outlaw still. Wilt. Is he alive? Col. Green. Better, perhaps, of him we speak no more. Wilt. Is he alive? Col. Green. Alive?âYou well may ask, When every hour the gibbet look'd for him. Wilt. The gibbet!âHeaven! Col. Green. Ay, sir. It had been well For you, your uncle in his bed had died! Wilt. I heed not how My uncle diedâI only heed his death. The manner of it, but for him, I wish Other than what it was, if such it was! I heed the shame? Were he alive, and now In jeopardy of such extremity, With all the dismal stages yet to pass, I'd stand beside him in the felon's dock; I'd lie beside him in the convict's cell; I'd walk beside him to the fatal treeâ Which, if I could, with marble I'd supplantâ A monument, whereon I would record His honour'd name, and all he did for me, And under-grave my own in love and gratitude! [Col. Green rushes up to the table, throws himself into a chair, and hides his face in his hands. What ails you, sir? You are convulsed. Sir!âsir! What ails you?âSpeak to me!âOr can't you speak, Or don't you hear?âYou shake from head to foot. What shall be brought you?âWhom shall I call for? Col. Green. [Starting up.] Call For Henry Sherbrooke!âIf you know not him, Then find me Wilton Brown.â'Tis all the sameâ Childâstriplingâmanâmy eldest brother's sonâ The boy that stood upon the beach with me Twelve years and more ago! Wilt. My uncle! Col. Green. Ay! Unscathed! Alive! as ne'er he was before. The uncle in whose arms you lay, the night We took the boat upon that stormy beach Wilt. Take me again to them, or else I drop! Col. Green. Rouse thee, boy, rouse thee! Something is to do! Collect thyselfâThe Duke!â'Tis near the time! Wilt. From what a trance have you awaken'd me Of happiness, to what reality! Col. Green. Reality! Why, Wilton, look on me; Aged in my prime, the work of years outdone By watchings, strugglings, strainings, spent in vain! Of glory deeply smit, as you, with love, Yet baffled in my wooing worse than you! Reality! There's none, boy, but the thought Of doing right! He grasps who holds to that! You'll do your duty? Wilt. Will I not? Col. Green. You will! Wilt. Uncle, 'tis death!âbut I'll go through with't still! [They go out. SCENE III. âA place near Kensington Palace. Lord Byer. This summons to the king fell out perversely. As jaded traveller, when drawing near His journey's end, feels every mile a league, So, my revenge, at hand, but still delay'd, Turns minutes into hours! Ten stages Time Has paced since noon, still lagging more and more; And now he seems to stop! Will he go on? He's half-way to the next; yet, to my thought, He has not stirr'd! Life, measured by suspense, Lasts ages!âTalk of threescore years and ten! A day, an hour, has durance of a life! Yet am I ill at ease on more accounts Than this. My colleagues eye me with strange looks; Whisper apart! I heard them nameâand more Than onceâLord Sunbury.âIs he expected? And if he is, my office near the king Draws to a close. No matter!âI am still The Earl of Byerdale! My brother's death, My nephew's spurious birth, assure me that! Whate'er hangs loose, hate can't unrobe me there. I'll home! What keeps my coach? Will't never come? I need its help! Impatience yearns for speed. SCENE IV. âA Chamber in Lord Byerdale's. Enter the Duke of Gaveston and Lady Laura. Lady Lau. Why, father, come we hither? Duke of Gav. They know best Who guided us. The ceremony here They judge, perhaps, with better grace perform'd Than in my prison-house. Their compact kept, The stipulation it was granted on, Although abandon'd as to hour and place, I shall fulfil, whate'er the hour and place, Much as my blood rebels! Lady Lau. Came they not in Along with us? Duke of Gav. Yes; but held back to speak. Lady Lau. [Aside.] I saw no priest; I read no bridals in his looksâthough love Was thereâbut such as finds its hopes a blank! Not once he took my hand, nor came so much As even within reach on't; when, had I seen One proffering step, I had met his half-way. I thought to be his wife to-morrow, and The day is farther off, if e'er to come, Or I mistake, when he shall call me bride! He comes!âWhy comes he?âTo forbid the banns!â I know it.âCan he find no other lips With theme so harsh to jar his lady's ear? Enter Wilton and Colonel Green, and Lord Sunbury. Duke of Gav. So far we have done your pleasure passively, Nor halt we yet. The stipulation Whereon our full enlargement was vouchsafedâ Your union with my daughterâthough foregone By your own choice, when by agreement due, Lies at your option still. This hand is yours When he, whose holy act of two makes one, Shall minister the nuptial ceremony. Wilt. First let me bless this hand so proffer'd me! Bless for the life that it would give to me, Enrich'd by all that fondest heart of man E'er fancied in its wildest coveting, Of beauty, chastity, and goodnessâall Enrich'd by holiest, most surpassing love! May plighting wait it from some happy palm Of purer blood than his who holds it now, Of clasp as honestâwill as strong to cleave!â Else!âere the priest for ever makes it his, May Heaven in its sweet mercy wrest it thence, And save the gift that else were cast away, As now 'tis torn from mine! Lady Lau. Wilton! Duke of Gav. My child! Hold up! If, sir, my scruples sway this act, This act, that gives them way, has vanquish'd them. The Earl has kept his word, and the condition Whereon 'twas pledged, and which I had withheld With all my heart, with all my heart I yield. Wilt. The Earl has kept his word, but was forestall'd. To wed your daughter I was doubly bound, And am so still, so you will have us wed; Whereof the choice now solely rests with you, Now fully freed from all contingencies. My birth was yet a secret to me, which I knew the Earl possess'd, and which to win, I pledged an oath ne'er to divulge to you The knowledge on't, while yet the trench remain'd 'Twixt you and liberty. The knowledge came, And with it such abasement of my blood, As, well I knew, no drop of yours would brook! What course was I to take?âTime pacing on! The hour almost within a stride!âyour life In jeopardy, as I believed!âyour shame The ransom, without option to refuse Or grant!âmy will beleaguer'd solemnlyâ All that of endless din, and strife, and wrack Is told of chaos, gather'd up and penn'd, I felt within my soul! Lady Lau. Is this man noble? Is he not, father? If he be not, rend All patents that make birth! Wilton, go on! I see the end! you sought for other means To set my father free? Wilt. I did. A friend Supplied me with them. 'Twas the king that oped Your prison door. You are at liberty Without the aid of barque or foreign land, Without the gift of child or aught to meâ A man whose birth, what'er his truth may be, Bearing, or reach, refuses him a name, Drawing the breath he could not help but draw, Unsanction'd by the priest! Lady Lau. Why start you, father? Duke of Gav. No priest the union of your parents bless'd? Wilt. None, sir; what noble dame would wed with me? Lady Lau. Iâor I never wed! Duke of Gav. Daughter! Lady Lau. Where worth is, Give honour, or nowhere! O, truth! lives shame Where you abide? Manhood, go beg, if flaws In your escutcheon point you out to scorn! He who foregoes high fortune for a blur That in his proper nature owns no germ, She doubly should enforce her favours on! Confess it, father, noble as thou art! Thy blood it is that's speaking in thy child; To generosity be generous! Thy daughter's heart is wedded to his worth; Give him the thing that's second to her heartâ The hand it nourishes! Duke of Gav. Never! Lady Lau. [After a pause, throwing herself on Wilton's neck.] O, Wilton! [Lord Byerdale enters in the back-ground. Lord Byer. Tied!âTied!âFast tied! and now my triumph comes! Solace for e'en disgrace! [Comes forward.] Joy, my lord duke! Joy of your son-in-law? I told your grace He was of noble stock, and told you trueâ My eldest brother's love-begotten son! His father's title and estates, 'tis true, Cleave not, by custom, to his parentage: But what o' that? Fowlers that miss the game, But yet come near to it, find comfort there! Your daughter had been married to an earl, Had but some dozen words been mumbled, ere Her husband's mother gave him to the light! Wilt. My lord, we are not wed. Lord Byer. How came you here? 'Tis false! Without the priest's due offices I took full heed no bolt should yield him way. Wilt. The master of the prison drew the bolt. Lord Byer. The governor? Wilt. The governor of him. The king's own order the good Duke enlarged, Enabled me to keep my oath, without Offence against my honourâsnared by thee, Unnatural uncle! Thus of half its aim Thy malice balk'd, these are unscathed and free; Thy only victim thy own brother's son! Lady Lau. Unscathed and free!âand thou a victim, Wilton? Lop off the part of a limb, and, if you will, Call what remains unscathedâthere may be gain; But here is loss and loss, and nothing else! Unscathed! O Heaven!âand thou with gallÃ©d quick! Father, the word you gave, I ne'er gave back. It made me his by pledgeâI stand so still! To fortune, honour, I had let him go, But not to woe and shame! They knot me to him! Wilton, I share thy voyage, come what will! I take the sea with thee whate'er thy boat, Howe'er the windâwhere'er the shoal or rock, Yea, or the whirlpool, which a mouthful makes Of mariners and ship!âstorms, strandings, wrecks, Engulfings, there am I, where you're afloat; Be it but upon a plankâwhere you go down I sink! Col. Green. [Tapping Lord Byerdale on the shoulder.] A triumph worthy of a man, To place a goodly youth in such a strait, That virginhood, at dint of very ruth, Casts chariness asideâpays heed to naught Save love, at pity's promptings all resolved, Whate'er the cost, to succour and to save him! Lord Byer. Who is he that makes so bold? Col. Green. One to bold things Accustom'd; but allow'd ones, at the worst; Not bann'd, at least, by Nature's common lawsâ Whose life, at risk, he would not hesitate To save at peril of another man's. Yetâcould not see his enemy take boat, With certainty to founder when at sea, Without dissuading himâyea, grappling him With arms and heartâthough foot to foot next day Assured to stand against himâlife 'gainst life! Lord Byer. What are you? Col. Green. One at home beneath a roof As proud as even this! Lord Byer. Wretch! Col. Green. Give that name To him who sold a falling monarch's cause For hope to supersede an elder brother, Too stanch to heed the westing of the sun! Or him who bore that brother's infant heir Such love, he watch'd its fosterage with spies Who roughly question'd, but persuadingly Betray'd his orders to abstract the boy, For what kind purpose, charity may guess; Or him who for a second brotherâbann'd! Mulcted of scrip and friendship!âfar and wide Inquiries plied in hopes to find himânot Alive, but deadâthe man who made his breast, Thrice in one day, a shield to ward the blows Had carried death to his! Lord Byer. Whom speak'st thou of? Col. Green. Of theeâbut make amends within thy power, By one benignant, all-absolving act, Resigning title and estates to him Should be thy brother's heir! Lord Byer. To Wilton Brown! That boy without a nameâsave such a one As any dog may challengeâwhat it pleases The fancy of the owner give to himâ Col. Green. [Interposing.] Silence, sir! Lord Byer. Sir!âYou know my titleâ Col. Green. Yes; And give it you. Lord Byer. Sir! Col. Green. Silence, sir, again! Lord Byer. Who art thou, villain, that accost'st me thus? Col. Green. No less a villain than your second brother! Lord Byer. A traitor!âan attainted traitor! come To wrest my rights from me! Wretch!âI attach you In virtue of my office! Lord Sun. That is gone. Lord Byer. Lord Sunbury!âReturn'd from France! Lord Sun. In time To thank your lordship for your patronage Of this, his noble ward! farther, relieve you Of the charge of office, whereto bear I here His Majesty's commands. Your power is gone! Col. Green. And, were it not, its virtue here were void, By supersedence of the royal grace; There is the king's free pardon! Farther; there, Restoral of my proper patrimony, Engulf'd, with the rest, by thy rapacity! And, farther, still, to make that grace complete, Here recognition of your nephew's rights, As your first brother's son! Lord Byer. There, 'twixt the king And me the laws will stand! No spurious son Can hold succession, such as he allows. Col. Green. Who said a spurious son? I mean a son In lawful wedlock born! Lord Byer. Where is he? Col. Green. There, Bless'd in the bride his worth alone has won! His worth, which, to the crowning trial put, Has shown itself the paragon of proof! Lord Byer. We must have documents for this. Col. Green. You shall! Such as the witness'd vouchers of his birthâ O' the nuptials of his parentsâfully proved; Of the grounds for their concealment full set forthâ Whereof some portion is referr'd to youâ Your brother's will, moreover, duly seal'd, And fixing the succession on his child. Lord Byer. May!â Col. Green. Imprecations stick to guilty heads, But from the innocent fall harmless off, So do not utter them. Lord Byer. What's in my heart You can't prevent its uttering to itself. Take your good fortuneâWear itâas I wish! [Rushes out. Lord Sun. Wilton, I give you joy! Wilt. My benefactor, That foster'd me in boyhood, welcome back! Duke. [Stepping between Wilton and Laura.] Wilton, I know I must not ask your pardon. All the atonement I can make, I do; And take it as thou wilt. [Joins their hands. Wilt. With reverence, With honour, gratitude, and endless love! Sher. [Rushing in.] I cannot be away, howe'er unbidden! O, credit me for all a son should feel; I own to a tear, but yet it is not one That falls at your good fortune. That I loved you, You knowâthat I withheld the confidence Which should in couples ever go with love, Our honest uncle bear the blame, who likes To see the way clear, ere he takes the road. I am not one that will not venture forth Long as a cloud hangs out a threat of rain; He is, and I was bound to do his will. The king hath made the perfect clearing up! 'Tis true I am a loser; but, indeed, One that o'erlooks his lossesâin your gains. Wilt. Sherbrooke, we'll have one fortune as one heart! Why, all goes well. Lady Lau. All? Col. Green. All, if these our friends Cry us Good speed, and parting bear no grudge: Kind looks outstrip kind tongues. We partâgood friends. THE END.</field>
