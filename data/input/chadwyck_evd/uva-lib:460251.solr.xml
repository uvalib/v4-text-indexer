      <field name="fulltext">Gustavus Vasa, THE Deliverer of his Country. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A PREFATORY DEDICATION TO THE SUBSCRIBERS. As I esteem'd it my Happiness to live under a Government, where National Liberty was establish'd by Law, and the Rights of Subjects interwove with their Allegiance: So I ever thought it my Safety to act with such allowable Freedom, as did not contradict any of our written and known Regulations. Tho' inconsiderable in myself, I am yet a Subject of Great-Britain; and the Privileges of her meanest Member are dear to the whole Constitution. Among those Privileges, I claim that of justifying my Conduct, I claim that of defending my Property, and wish I could do both, without giving Disgust, ev'n to Those by whose Censures I am a Sufferer. When I wrote the following Sheets I had studied the ancient Laws of my Country, but was not conversant with her present political State. I did not consider Things minutely; in the general View I liked our Constitution, and zealously wish'd that the Religion, the Laws, and Liberties of England might ever be sacred and safe. I had nothing to fear or hope from Party or Preferment. My Attachments were only to Truth, I was conscious of no other Principles, and was far from apprehending that Such could be offensive. I took my Subject from the History of Sweden, one of those Gothic and glorious Nations, from whom our Form of Government is derived, from whom Britain has inherited those unextinguishable Sparks of Liberty and Patriotism, that were Her Light thro' the Ages of Ignorance and Superstition, Her flaming Sword turn'd ev'ry Way against Invasion, and that vital Heat which has so often preserved Her, so often restored Her from intestine Malignities. Those are the Sparks, the Gems, that alone give true Ornament and Brightness to the Crown of a British Monarch; that give Him freely to reign over the Free; and shall ever set Him above the Princes of the Earth; till Corruption grow universal; till Subjects wish to be Slaves, and Kings know not how to be Happy. I was pleased with this Similitude between the Principles, and, as I may say, between the natural Constitutions of Sweden and Britain. I look'd no further for Sentiments, than as they arose from Facts, and for the Facts I am indebted to History: Nay, I ingenuously confess, I was so far from a View of Merit with the Disaffected, that I look'd on this Performance as the highest Compliment I could pay the present Establishment—Such was my Ignorance, or such is my Misfortune. Many are the Difficulties a new Author has to encounter in introducing his Play on the Stage. I had the good Fortune to surmount them; this Piece was about five Weeks in Rehearsal, the Day was appointed for Acting, I had disposed of many hundred Tickets, and imagined I had nothing to fear but from the Weakness of the Performance. But then it was, that where I look'd for Approbation, I met with Repulse. I was condemn'd and punish'd in my Works without being accus'd of any Crime, and made obnoxious to the Government under which I live, without having it in my Power to alter my Conduct, or knowing in what Instance I had given Offence. However singular and unprecedented this Treatment may appear: Had I conceived it to be the Intention of the Legislature, I should have submitted without complaining. Or had any, among Hundreds who have perused the Manuscript, observed but a single Line that might inadvertently tend to Sedition or Immorality, I wou'd then have been the first to strike it out, I wou'd now be the last to publish it. Had the Dignity of the Ld. C????n's Office condescended, as some wou'd insinuate, to a Theatrical Examination of the Drama, to a critical Inquisition of the Conduct, the Unities, and Tricks of Scenery, even so I might have hoped for equal Indulgence with Farces, Pantomimes, and other Performances of like Taste and Genius. But this is not the Case, the Ld. C????n's Office is alone concerned in those Reasons which gave Birth to the Statute, it is to guard against such Representations as He may conceive to be of pernicious Influence in the Commonwealth; this is the only Point to which his Prohibitions are understood to extend, and his Prohibition lays me under the Necessity of publishing this Piece, to convince the Public, that (tho' of no valuable Consequence) I am at least inoffensive. Patriotism, or the Love of Country, is the great and single Moral which I had in View thro' this Play. This Love (so superior in its Nature to all other Interests and Affections) is personated in the Character of Gustavus. It is the Love of National Welfare; National Welfare is National Liberty; and He alone can be conscious of it, He alone can contribute to the Support of it, who is personally free. By Personal Freedom I mean that State resulting from Virtue; or Reason ruling in the Breast superior to Appetite and Passion; and by National Freedom I mean a Security (arising from the Nature of a well-order'd Constitution) for those Advantages and Privileges that each Man has a Right to, by contributing as a Member to the Weal of that Community. The Monarch or Head of such a Constitution, is as the Father of a large and well regulated Family, his Subjects are not Servants, but Sons; their Care, their Affections, their Attachments are reciprocal, and their Interest is one, is not to be divided. This is truly to Reign; this, only, is to Reign. How glorious, how extensive is the Prerogative of such a Monarch! He is superior to Subjects, each of whom is equal to any Monarch, who is only superior to Slaves. He is scepter'd in the Hearts of his People, from whence He directs their Hands with double Force and Energy. His Office partakes of the Divine Inclination, by being exerted to no other End, but the Happiness of a People. O, never may any Subtleties, any Insinuations raise groundless Jealousies in a People so govern'd! never may they be influenced to imagine that such a Prince is invading their Rights, while He is only solicitous to confirm and preserve them! And never may any Ministry, any Adulation, seduce such a Prince from that his true Interest and Honour! I shou'd not have had the Assurance to sollicite a Subscription in Favour of Sentiments that any Circumstance could ever make me retract. These, and these only, are the Principles of which you are Patrons; and the honourable Names prefix'd to this Performance lay me under such a future Obligation of Conduct, as shall ever make me cautious of forfeiting the Advantages I receive from them. They are also to me a lasting Memorial of that Gratitude with which I am, Your most Oblig'd, most Faithful, and most Humble Servant, Henry Brooke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Britons! this Night presents a State distress'd, Tho' brave, yet vanquish'd; and tho' great, oppress'd; Vice, rav'ning Vulture, on her Vitals prey'd, Her Peers, her Prelates, fell Corruption sway'd; Their Rights, for Pow'r, th' Ambitious weakly sold, The Wealthy, poorly, for superfluous Gold; Hence wasting Ills, hence sev'ring Factions rose, And gave large Entrance to invading Foes; Truth, Justice, Honour fled th' infected Shore, For Freedom, sacred Freedom was no more. Then, greatly rising in his Country's Right, Her Hero, her Deliverer sprung to Light; A Race of hardy, northern Sons he led, Guiltless of Courts, untainted, and unread, Whose inborn Spirit spurn'd th' ignoble Fee, Whose Hands scorn'd Bondage, for their Hearts were free. Ask ye what Law their conq'ring Cause confess'd? Great Nature's Law, the Law within the Breast, Form'd by no Art, and to no Sect confin'd, But stamp'd by Heav'n upon th' unletter'd Mind. Such, such, of old, the first born Natives were, Who breath'd the Vertues of Brittania's Air, The Realm, when mighty Cæsar vainly sought; For mightier Freedom against Cæsar fought, And rudely drove the fam'd Invader Home, To tyrannize o'er polish'd—venal Rome. Our Bard, exalted in a freeborn Flame, To ev'ry Nation wou'd transfer this Claim, He to no State, no Climate bounds his Page, He bids the Moral beam thro' ev'ry Age; Then be your Judgment gen'rous as his Plan, Ye Sons of Freedom!—save the Friend of Man.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Inside of the Copper-Mines in Dalecarlia. Enter Anderson, Arnoldus, and Servants, with Torches. And. You tell me Wonders. Arn. Soft, behold, my Lord, [Points behind the Scenes. Behold him stretch'd, where reigns eternal Night, The Flint his Pillow, and cold Damps his Cov'ring; Yet bold of Spirit, and robust of Limb, He throws Inclemency aside, nor feels The Lot of human Frailty. And. What Horrors hang around! the savage Race Ne'er hold their Den but where some glimm'ring Ray May bring the Chear of Morn—What then is he? His Dwelling marks a Secret in his Soul, And whispers somewhat more than Man about him. Arn. Draw but the Veil of his apparent Wretchedness, And you shall find, his Form is but assumed To hoard some wond'rous Treasure, lodg'd within. And. Let him bear up to what thy Praises speak him, And I will win him spite of his Reserve, Bind him with sacred Friendship to my Soul, And make him half myself. Arn. 'Tis nobly promis'd; For Worth is rare, and wants a Friend in Sweden; And yet I tell thee, in her Age of Heroes, When nurs'd by Freedom, all her Sons grew great, And ev'ry Peasant was a Prince in Virtue; I greatly err, or this abandon'd Stranger Had stepp'd the first for Fame—tho' now he seeks To veil his Name, and cloud his Shine of Virtues; For there is Danger in them. And. True, Arnoldus, Were there a Prince throughout the scepter'd Globe, Who search'd out Merit for its due Preferment, With half that Care our Tyrant seeks it out For Ruin; happy, happy were that State, Beyond the golden Fable of those pure And earliest Ages—Wherefore this, good Heav'n? Is it of Fate, that who assumes a Crown Throws off Humanity? Arn. So Cristiern holds. He claims our Country as by Right of Conquest, A Right to ev'ry Wrong. Ev'n now 'tis said, The Tyrant envies what our Mountains yield Of Health or Aliment, he comes upon us, Attended by a num'rous Host, to seize These last Retreats of our expiring Liberty. And. Say'st thou? Arn. This rising Day, this instant Hour, Thus chaced, we stand upon the utmost Brink Of steep Perdition, and must leap the Precipice, Or turn upon our Hunters, And. Now, Gustavus! Thou Prop and Glory of inglorious Sweden, Where art thou mightiest Man?—Were he but here!— I'll tell thee, my Arnoldus, I beheld him, Then when he first drew Sword, serene and dreadful, As the brow'd Evening 'ere the Thunder break; For soon he made it toilsom to our Eyes To mark his Speed, and trace the Paths of Conquest; In vain we follow'd, where he swept the Field; 'Twas Death alone could wait upon Gustavus. Arn. He was indeed whate'er our Wish could form him. And. Array'd and beauteous in the Blood of Danes, Th' Invaders of his Country, thrice he chaced This Cristiern, this fell Conq'rer, this Usurper, With Rout and foul Dishonour at his Heels, To plunge his Head in Denmark. Arn. Nor ever had the Tyrant known Return, To tread our Necks, and blend us with the Dust; Had he not dar'd to break thro' ev'ry Law That sanctifies the Nations, seiz'd our Hero, The Pledge of specious Treaty, tore him from us, And led him chain'd to Denmark. And. Then we fell. If still he lives, we yet may learn to rise, But never can I dare to rest a Hope On any Arm but his. Arn. And yet I trust, This Stranger that delights to dwell with Darkness Unknown, unfriended, compass'd round with Wretchedness, Conceals some mighty Purpose in his Breast, Now lab'ring into Birth. And. When came he hither? Arn. Six Moons have chang'd upon the Face of Night, Since here he first arriv'd, in servile Weeds, But yet of Mein majestic. I observ'd him, And ever as I gaz'd, some nameless Charm, A wond'rous Greatness not to be conceal'd, Broke thro' his Form, and aw'd my Soul before him. Amid these Mines he earns the Hireling's Portion; His Hands out-toil the Hind, while on his Brow Sits Patience, bathed in the laborious Drop Of painful Industry—I oft have sought, With friendly Tender of some worthier Service, To win him from his Temper; but he shuns All Offers, yet declined with graceful Act, Engaging beyond Utt'rance; and at Eve, When all retire to some domestic Solace, He only stays, and, as you see, the Earth Receives him to her dark and cheerless Bosom. And. Has no unwary Moment e'er betray'd The Labours of his Soul, some fav'rite Grief, Whereon to raise Conjecture? Arn. I saw, as some bold Peasants late deplor'd Their Country's Bondage, sudden Passion seiz'd And bore him from his Seeming; strait his Form Was turn'd to Terror, Ruin fill'd his Eye, And his proud Step appear'd to awe the World: When check'd as thro' an Impotence of Rage, Damp Sadness soon usurp'd upon his Brow, And the big Tear roll'd graceful down his Visage. And. Your Words imply a Man of much Importance. Arn. So I suspected, and at dead of Night Stole on his Slumbers; his full Heart was busy, And oft his Tongue pronounc'd the hated Name Of—Bloody Cristiern—there he seem'd to pause: And recollected to one Voice, he cry'd, O Sweden! O my Country! Yet I'll save thee. And. Forbear—he rises—Heav'ns, what Majesty! SCENE II. Enter Gustavus. And. Your Pardon, Stranger, if the Voice of Virtue, If cordial Amity from Man to Man, And somewhat that should whisper to the Soul, To seek and chear the Suff'rer, led me hither Impatient to salute thee. Be it thine Alone to point the Path of Friendship out; And my best Pow'r shall wait upon thy Fortunes. Gust. Yes, gen'rous Man! there is a wond'rous Test, The truest, worthiest, noblest Cause for Friendship; Dearer than Life, than Int'rest, or Alliance, And equal to your Virtues. And. Say—unfold. Gust. Art thou a Soldier, a chief Lord in Sweden? And yet a Stranger to thy Country's Voice That loudly calls the hidden Patriot forth; But what's a Soldier? What's a Lord in Sweden? All Worth is fled, or fall'n—nor has a Life Been spar'd, but for Dishonour; spar'd to breed More Slaves for Denmark, to beget a Race Of new-born Virgins for th' unsated Lust Of our new Masters. Sweden! thou'rt no more! Queen of the North! thy Land of Liberty, Thy House of Heroes, and thy Seat of Virtues Is now the Tomb, where thy brave Sons lie speechless; And foreign Snakes engender. And. O 'tis true. But wherefore? To what Purpose? Gust. Think of Stockholm! When Cristiern seized upon the Hour of Peace, And drench'd the hospitable Floor with Blood; Then fell the Flow'r of Sweden, mighty Names! Her hoary Senators, and gasping Patriots. The Tyrant spoke, and his licentious Band Of Blood-train'd Ministry were loosed to Ruin. Invention wanton'd in the Toil of Infants Stabb'd on the Breast, or reeking on the Points Of sportive Javelins. Husbands, Sons, and Sires With dying Ears drank in the loud Despair Of shrieking Chastity. The Waste of War Was Peace and Friendship to this civil Massacre. O Heav'n and Earth! Is there a Cause for this? For Sin without Temptation, calm, cool Villany, Delib'rate Mischief, unimpassion'd Lust, And smiling Murder? Lie thou there, my Soul, Sleep, sleep upon it, image not the Form Of any Dream but this, 'till Time grows pregnant, And thou canst wake to Vengeance. And. Thou'st greatly mov'd me. Ha! thy Tears start forth. Yes, let them flow, our Country's Fate demands them; I too will mingle mine, while yet 'tis left us To weep in secret, and to sigh with Safety. But wherefore talk of Vengeance? 'Tis a Word Should be engraven on the new fall'n Snow, Where the first Beam may melt it from Observance. Vengeance on Cristiern! Norway and the Dane, The Sons of Sweden, all the peopled North Bends at his Nod: my humbler Boast of Pow'r Meant not to cope with Crowns. Gust. Then what remains Is briefly this; your Friendship has my Thanks, But must not my Acceptance: never—no— First sink thou baleful Mansion to the Centre! And be thy Darkness doubled round my Head; 'Ere I forsake thee for the Bliss of Paradise, To be enjoy'd beneath a Tyrant's Sceptre; No, that were willful Slav'ry—Freedom is The brillant Gift of Heav'n, 'tis Reason's Self, The Kin of Deity—I will not part it. And. Nor I, while I can hold it, but alas! That is not in our Choice. Gust. Why? where's that Pow'r whose Engines are of Force To bend the brave and virtuous Man to Slav'ry? Base Fear, the Laziness of Lust, gross Appetites, These are the Ladders, and the groveling Footstool, From whence the Tyrant rises on our Wrongs, Secure and scepter'd in the Soul's Servility. He has debauch'd the Genius of our Country, And rides triumphant, while her captive Sons Await his Nod, the silken Slaves of Pleasure, Or fetter'd in their Fears. And. I apprehend you. No doubt, a base Submission to our Wrongs May well be term'd a voluntary Bondage; But think the heavy Hand of Pow'r is on us; Of Pow'r, from whose Imprisonment and Chains Not all our free-born Virtue can protect us. Gust. 'Tis there you err, for I have felt their Force; And had I yielded to enlarge these Limbs, Or share the Tyrant's Empire, on the Terms Which he propos'd—I were a Slave indeed. No—in the deep and deadly Damp of Dungeons The Soul can rear her Sceptre, smile in Anguish, And triumph o'er Oppression. And. O glorious Spirit! think not I am slack To relish what thy noble Scope intends, But then the Means! the Peril! and the Consequence! Great are the Odds, and who shall dare the Trial? Gust. I dare. O wer't thou still that gallant Chief Whom once I knew! I cou'd unfold a Purpose Would make the Greatness of thy Heart to swell, And burst in the Conception. And. Give it Utt'rance. Perhaps there lie some Embers yet in Sweden, Which, waken'd by thy Breath, might rise in Flames, And spread vindictive round—You say you know me; But give a Tongue to such a Cause as this, And if you hold me tardy in the Call, You know me not—But Thee I've surely known; For there is somewhat in that Voice and Form, Which has alarm'd my Soul to Recollection; But 'tis as in a Dream, and mocks my Reach. Gust. Then name the Man whom it is Death to know, Or knowing to conceal—and I am he. And. Gustavus! Heav'n's! 'Tis he! 'tis he himself! SCENE III. Enter Arvida, Speaking to a Servant. Arv. I thank you, Friend, he's here, you may retire. And. Good Morning to my noble Guest, you're early! [Gustavus walks apart. Arv. I come to take a short and hasty Leave: 'Tis said, that from the Mountain's neighb'ring Brow, The Canvas of a thousand Tents appears, Whitening the Vale—Suppose the Tyrant there; You know my Safety lies not in the Interview— Ha! What is he, who in the Shreds of Slavery Supports a Step, superior to the State, And Insolence of Ermine? Gust. Sure that Voice, Was once the Voice of Friendship and Arvida! Arv. Ha! Yes—'tis he!—ye Pow'rs! it is Gustavus. Gust. Thou Brother of Adoption! In the Bond Of ev'ry Virtue wedded to my Soul, Enter my Heart, it is thy Property. Arv. I'm lost in Joy and wond'rous Circumstance. Gust. Yes, wherefore, my Arvida, wherefore is it, That in a Place, and at a Time like this, We should thus meet? Can Cristiern cease from Cruelty? Say, whence is this, my Brother? How escap'd you? Did I not leave thee in the Danish Dungeon? Arv. Of that hereafter. Let me view thee first. How graceful is the Garb of Wretchedness! When worn by Virtue? Fashions turn to Folly; Their Colours tarnish, and their Pomps grow poor To her Magnificence. Gust. Yes, my Arvida. Beyond the sweeping of the proudest Train That shades a Monarch's Heel, I prize these Weeds, For they are sacred to my Country's Freedom. A mighty Enterprize has been conceiv'd, And thou art come auspicious to the Birth, As sent to fix the Seal of Heav'n upon it. Arv. Point but thy Purpose—let it be to bleed— Gust. Your Hands my Friends! All. Our Hearts. Gust. I know they're brave. Of such the Time has need, of Hearts like yours, Faithful and firm, of Hands inured and strong, For we must ride upon the Neck of Danger, And plunge into a Purpose big with Death. And. Here let us kneel and bind us to thy Side. By all— Gust. No, hold—if we want Oaths to join us, Swift let us part, from Pole to Pole asunder. A Cause like ours is its own Sacrament; Truth, Justice, Reason, Love, and Liberty, Th' eternal Links that clasp the World are in it, And he, who breaks their Sanction, breaks all Law, And infinite Connection. Arn. True, my Lord. And. And such the Force I feel. Arv. And I. Arn. And all. Gust. Know then, that 'ere our royal Stenon fell, While this my valiant Cousin and myself, By Chains and Treach'ry, lay detain'd in Denmark, Upon a dark and unsuspected Hour The bloody Cristiern sought to take my Head. Thanks to the ruling Pow'r! within whose Eye Imbosom'd Ills and mighty Treasons roll, Prevented of their Blackness—I escap'd, Led by a gen'rous Arm, and some time lay Conceal'd in Denmark. For my forfeit Head Became the Price of Crowns, each Port and Path Was shut against my Passage, 'till I heard That Stenon, valiant Stenon fell in Battle, And Freedom was no more. O then what Bounds Had Pow'r to hem the Desp'rate? I o'erpass'd them, Travers'd all Sweden, thro' Ten thousand Foes, Impending Perils, and surrounding Tongues, That from himself enquir'd Gustavus out. Witness my Country, how I toil'd to wake Thy Sons to Liberty! In vain—for Fear, Cold Fear had seiz'd on all—Here last I came, And shut me from the Sun, whose hateful Beams Serv'd but to shew the Ruins of my Country. When here, my Friends, 'twas here at length I found What I had left to look for, gallant Spirits, In the rough Form of untaught Peasantry. And. Indeed they once were brave, our Dalecarlians Have oft been known to give a Law to Kings; And as their only Wealth has been their Liberty, From all th' unmeasur'd Graspings of Ambition Have held that Gem untouch'd—tho' now 'tis fear'd— Gust. It is not fear'd—I say they still shall hold it. I've search'd these Men, and find them like the Soil, Barren without, and to the Eye unlovely, But they've their Mines within; and this the Day In which I mean to prove them. Arn. O Gustavus! Most aptly hast thou caught the passing Hour, Upon whose critical and fated Hinge The State of Sweden turns. Gust. And to this Hour I've therefore held me in this darksome Womb, That sends me forth as to a second Birth Of Freedom, or thro' Death to reach Eternity. This Day return'd with ev'ry circling Year, In Thousands pours the Mountain Peasants forth, Each with his batter'd Arms and rusty Helm, In sportive Discipline well train'd, and prompt Against the Day of Peril—thus disguis'd, Already have I stirr'd their latent Sparks Of slumb'ring Virtue, apt as I cou'd wish To warm before the lightest Breath of Liberty. Arn. How will they kindle when confess'd to View Once more their lov'd Gustavus stands before them, And pours his Blaze of Virtues on their Souls. Arv. It cannot fail. And. It has a glorious Aspect. Arv. Now Sweden! rise and re-assert thy Rights, Or be for ever fall'n. And. Then be it so. Arn. Lead on, thou Arm of War, To Death or Victory. Gust. Let us embrace. Why thus, my Friends, thus join'd in such a Cause, Are we not equal to a Host of Slaves! You say the Foe's at Hand—Why let them come, Steep are our Hills nor easy of Access, And few the Hours we ask for their Reception. For I will take these rustic Sons of Liberty In the first Warmth and Hurry of their Souls; And shou'd the Tyrant then attempt our Heights, He comes upon his Fate—Arise thou Sun! Haste, haste to rouze thee to the Call of Liberty, That shall once more salute thy Morning Beam, And hail thee to thy Setting. Arn. O bless'd Voice! Prolong that Note but one short Day thro' Sweden, And tho' the Sun and Life should set together, It matters not—we shall have liv'd that Day. Arv. Were it not worth the Hazard of a Life To know if Cristiern leads his Pow'rs in Person, And what his Scope intends? Be mine that Task, Ev'n to the Tyrant's Tent I'll win my Way, And mingle with his Councils. Gust. Go, my Friend. Dear as thou art, whene'er our Country calls, Friends, Sons, and Sires should yield their Treasure up, Nor own a Sense beyond the publick Safety. But tell me, my Arvida, 'ere thou goest, Tell me what Hand has made thy Friend its Debtor, And giv'n thee up to Freedom and Gustavus? Arv. Ha! let me think of that, 'tis sure she loves him. [Aside. Away thou skance and jaundice Eye of Jealousy, That tempts my Soul to sicken at Perfection; Away! I will unfold it—To thyself Arvida owes his Freedom. Gust. How, my Friend? Arv. Some Months are pass'd since in the Danish Dungeon With Care emaciate, and unwholsome Damps Sick'ning I lay, chain'd to my flinty Bed, And call'd on Death to ease me—strait a Light Shone round, as when the Ministry of Heav'n Descends to kneeling Saints. But O! the Form That pour'd upon my Sight—Ye Angels speak! For ye alone are like her; or present Such Visions pictur'd to the nightly Eye Of Fancy trans'd in Bliss. She then approach'd, The softest Pattern of embodied Meekness, For Pity had divinely touch'd her Eye, And harmoniz'd her Motions—Ah, she cry'd, Unhappy Stranger, art not thou the Man Whose Virtues have endear'd thee to Gustavus? Gust. Gustavus did she say? Arv. Yes, yes, her Lips Breath'd forth that Name with a peculiar Sweetness. Loos'd from my Bonds, I rose, at her Command, When, scarce recov'ring Speech, I would have kneel'd, But haste thee, haste thee for thy Life, she cry'd; And O, if e'er thy envied Eyes behold Thy lov'd Gustavus; say, a gentle Foe Has giv'n thee to his Friendship. Gust. You've much amaz'd me! Is her Name a Secret? Arv. To me it is—but you perhaps may guess. Gust. No, on my Word. Arv. You too had your Deliv'rer. Gust. A kind, but not a fair one—Well, my Friends! Our Cause is ripe, and calls us forth to Action. Tread ye not lighter? Swells not ev'ry Breast With ampler Scope to take your Country in, And breathe the Cause of Virtue? Rise, ye Swedes! Rise greatly equal to this Hour's Importance. On us the Eyes of future Ages wait, And this Day's Arm strikes forth decisive Fate; This Day, that shall for ever sink—or save; And make each Swede a Monarch—or a Slave. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE The Camp. Enter Cristiern, Attendants, &amp;c. Trollio meets him. Troll. All hail most mighty of the Thrones of Europe! The Morn salutes thee with auspicious Brightness, No Vapour frowns prophetic on her Brow, But the clear Sun who travels with thy Arms Still smiles, attendant on thy growing Greatness: His Evening Eye shall see thee peaceful Lord Of all the North, of utmost Scandinavia; Whence thou may'st pour thy Conquests o'er the Earth, 'Till farthest India glows beneath thy Empire, And Lybia knows no regal Name but yours. Crist. Yes, Trollio, I confess the Godlike Thirst, Ambition, that wou'd drink a Sea of Glory. But what from Dalecarlia? Troll. Late last Night, I sent a trusty Slave to Peterson, And hourly wait some Tidings. Crist. Think you?—Sure The Wretches will not dare such quick Perdition. Troll. I think they will not—Tho' of old I know them All born to Broils, the very Sons of Tumult; Waste is their Wealth, and Mutiny their Birthright, And this the yearly Fever of their Blood, Their Holiday of War; a Day apart, Torn out from Peace, and sacred to Rebellion. Oft has their Battle hung upon the Brow Of yon wild Steep, a living Cloud of Mischiefs, Pregnant with Plagues, and empty'd on the Heads Of many a Monarch. Crist. Monarchs they were not, Pageants of Wax, the Mouldings of the Populace, Tame paultry Idols, scepter'd up for Shew, And garnish'd into Royalty—No Trollio Kings should be felt if they wou'd find Obedience; The Beast has Sense enough to know his Rider, When the Knee trembles, and the Hand grows slack, He casts for Liberty: but bends and turns For him that leaps with Boldness on his Back, And spurs him to the Bit. SCENE II. Enter a Gentleman Usher, and several Peasants, who kneel and bow at a Distance. Crist. What Slaves are those? Gent. My gracious Liege, your Subjects. Crist. Whence? Gent. Of Sweden. From Angermannia, from Helsingia some, Some from Gemtian, and Nerician Provinces. Crist. Their Business. Gent. They come to speak their Griefs. Crist. Their Griefs! their Insolence! Is not the Camel mute beneath his Burden? Were they not born to bear? Away!—hold! come, What wou'd these Murmurers? Gent. Most royal Cristiern. They say they have but one—one gracious King, And yet are bow'd beneath a Host of Tyrants, Task-Masters, Soldiers, Gatherers of Subsidies, All Officers of Rapine, Rape, and Murder; Will-doing Potentates, the Lords of Licence, Who weigh their Sweat and Blood, and heavier Shame, Ev'n as a Feather puff'd away in Sport, The Pastime of a Gale. Crist. I'll hear no more. I know ye, well I know ye, ye base Supplicants, Fear is the only Worship of your Souls; And ever where ye hate, ye yield Obeysance. Wretches! Shall I go poring on the Earth, Lest my imperial Foot should tread on Emmets? Is it for you I must controul my Soldier, And coop my Eagles from their Carrion? No— Are ye not Commoners, vile Things in Nature, Poor priceless Peasants? Slaves can know no Property: Out of my Sight! [Exeunt Peasants. SCENE III. Enter Arvida guarded, and a Gentleman. Arv. Now Fate I'm caught, and what remains is obvious. Gent. A Prisoner, good my Lord. Crist. When taken? Gent. Now, ev'n here, before your Tent; I mark'd his careless Action, but his Eye Of studied Observation—then his Port And base Attire ill suiting—I enquir'd, But found he was a Stranger. Crist. Ha! observe. (Damn'd Affectation) what a sullen Scorn Knits up his Brow, and frowns upon our Presence. What—ay—thou wou'dst be thought a Mystery, Some Greatness in Eclipse—Whence art thou, Slave? Silent! Nay, then—Bring forth the Torture there— A Smile! Damnation!—How the Wretch assumes The Wreck of State, the suff'ring Soul of Majesty. What have we no Pre-eminence, no Claim? Dost thou not know thy Life is in our Pow'r? Arv. 'Tis therefore I despise it. Crist. Matchless Insolence! What art thou? Speak! Arv. Be sure no Friend to thee; For I'm a Foe to Tyrants. Crist. Fiends and Fire!— A Whirlwind tear thee most audacious Traitor. Arv. Do, rage and chafe, thy Wrath's beneath me, Cristiern. How poor thy Pow'r, how empty is thy Happiness, When such a Wretch, as I appear to be, Can ride thy Temper, harrow up thy Form, And stretch thy Soul upon the Rack of Passion. Crist. I'll know thee—I will know thee! Bear him hence! Why, what are Kings, if Slaves can brave us thus? Go, Trollio, hold him to the Rack—Tear, search him, Prove him thro' ev'ry Poignance, sting him deep. [Exit Trollio with Arvida guarded. SCENE IV. Enter a Messenger as in Haste. Crist. What wou'd'st thou, Fellow? Mess. O my sovereign Lord, I am come fast and far, from Ev'n 'till Morn, Five times I've cross'd the Shade of sleepless Night Impatient of thy Presence. Crist. Whence? Mess. From Denmark. Commended from the Consort of thy Throne To Speed and Privacy. Crist. Your Words wou'd taste of Terror—Wretch, speak out, Nor dare to tremble here—For didst thou bear Thy Tidings from a thousand Leagues around, Unmov'd, I move the Whole, the cent'ring Nave, Where turns that mighty Circle—Speak thy Message. Mess. A secret Malady, my gracious Liege, Some factious Vapour, risen from off the Skirts Of Southmost Norway, has diffus'd its Bane, And rages now within the Heart of Denmark. Crist. It must not, cannot, 'tis impossible! What, my own Danes? Nay, then the World wants Weeding. I will not bear it—Hell! I'd rather see, This Earth a Desart, desolate and wild, And like the Lion stalk my lonely Round, Famish'd and roaring for my Prey—Call Trollio, I'll have Men studied, deeply read in Mischiefs. SCENE V. Enter a Servant, who kneels and delivers a Letter. Crist. From whom? Serv. From Peterson. Crist. To Trollio—Right. [Reads. How's this?—Be gone— Go all—without there—wait my Pleasure. O Curse! How Hell has tim'd its Plagues! SCENE VI. Enter Trollio. Crist. Come near, my Trollio. We've heard ill News from Denmark—that's a Trifle— But here's to blast thy Eyes—Read— Troll. Ha! Gustavus! So near us, and in Arms! Crist. What's to be done? Now, Trollio, now's the Time To subtilize thy Soul, sound every Depth, And waken all the wond'rous Statesman in thee. For I must tell thee (spite of Pride and Royalty, Of guarding Armies, and of circling Nations That bend beneath my Nod) this curs'd Gustavus Invades my shrinking Spirits, awes my Heart, And sits upon my Slumbers—All in vain Has he been daring, and have I been vigilant; Spite of himself he still evades the Hunter, And if there's Pow'r in Heav'n or Hell it guards him. When was I vanquish'd, but when he oppos'd me? When have I conquer'd, but when he was absent? His Name's a Host, a Terror to my Legions. And by my tripled Crown, I swear, Gustavus, I'd rather meet all Europe for my Foe, Than see thy Face in Arms! Troll. Be calm, my Liege; And listen to a Secret big with Consequence, That gives thee back the second Man on Earth Whose Valour cou'd plant Fears around thy Throne: Thy Pris'ner— Crist. What of him? Troll. The Prince Arvida. Crist. How! Troll. The same. Crist. My royal Fugitive? Troll. Most certain. Crist. Now then 'tis plain who sent him hither. Troll. Yes. Pray give me Leave, my Lord—a Thought comes cross me— If so he must be ours— [Pauses. Your Pardon for a Question—Has Arvida E'er seen your beauteous Daughter, your Cristina? Crist. Never—yes—possibly he might, that Day When the proud Pair, Gustavus and Arvida, Thro' Copenhagen drew a Length of Chain, And grac'd my Chariot Wheels—but why the Question? Troll. I'll tell you—while e'en now he stood before us I mark'd his high Demeanour, and my Eye Claim'd some Remembrance of him, tho' in Clouds Doubtful and distant, but a nearer View Renew'd the Characters effac'd by Absence. Yet, lest he might presume upon a Friendship Of ancient League between us, I dissembled, Nor seem'd to know him—On he proudly strode, As who should say, back Fortune, know thy Distance! Thus steddily he pass'd, and mock'd his Fate. When, lo! the Princess to her Morning Walk Came forth attended—quick Amazement seiz'd Arvida at the Sight; his Steps took Root, A Tremor shook him; and his alt'ring Cheek Now sudden flush'd, then fled its wonted Colour; While with an eager and intemp'rate Look He bent his Form, and hung upon her Beauties. Crist. Ha! Did our Daughter note him? Troll. No, my Lord; She pass'd regardless—Strait his Pride fell from him, And at her Name he started. Then heav'd a Sigh, and cast a Look to Heav'n, Of such a mute, yet eloquent Emotion, As seem'd to say, now Fate thou hast prevail'd, And found one Way to triumph o'er Arvida! Crist. But whither wou'd this lead? Troll. List, list, my Lord! While thus his Soul's unseated, shook by Passion, Cou'd we engage him to betray Gustavus— Crist. O empty Hope! Impossible, my Trollio, Do I not know him, and the curs'd Gustavus? Both fix'd in Resolution deep as Hell, And proud as high Olympus! Troll. Ah, my Liege, No mortal Footing treads so firm in Virtue, As always to abide the slipp'ry Path, Nor deviate with the Biass—Some have few, But each Man has his Failing, some Defect Wherein to slide Temptation—Leave him to me. Crist. I know thou hast a serpentizing Genius, Can'st wind the subtlest Mazes of the Soul, And trace her Wand'rings to the Source of Action. If thou canst bend this proud one to our Purpose, And make the Lion crouch, 'tis well—if not, Away at once, and sweep him from Remembrance. Troll. Then I must promise deep. Crist. Ay, any thing; out-bid Ambition. Troll. Love? Crist. Ha! Yes—our Daughter too—if she can bribe him: But then to win him to betray his Friend? Troll. O doubt it not, my Lord—for if he loves, As sure he greatly does, I have a Stratagem That holds the Certainty of Fate within it. Love is a Passion whose Effects are various, It ever brings some Change upon the Soul, Some Virtue, or some Vice, 'till then unknown, Degrades the Hero, and makes Cowards valiant. Crist. True, when it pours upon a youthful Temper, Open and apt to take the Torrent in; It owns no Limits, no Restraint it knows, But sweeps all down tho' Heav'n and Hell oppose; Ev'n Virtue rears in vain her sacred Mound, Raz'd in its Rage, or in its Swellings drown'd. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. Opens and discovers Arvida in Chains, Guards preparing Instruments of Death and Torture. He advances in Confusion. Arv. Off, off, vain Cumbrance, ye conflicting Thoughts! Leave me to Heav'n. O Peace!—It will not be— Just when I rose above Mortality, To pour her wond'rous Weight of Charms upon me! At such a Time, it was, it was too much! To pluck the soaring Pinion of my Soul, While Eagle-ey'd she held her Flight to Heav'n, O'er Pain and Death triumphant! Help ye Saints, Angelic Ministers descend, descend! And lift me to myself; hold, bind my Heart Firm and unshaken in th' approaching Ruin, The Wreck of Earth-born Frailty! and O Heav'n! For ev'ry Pang these tortur'd Limbs shall feel, Descend in ten-fold Blessings on Gustavus! Yes, bless him, bless him! Crown his Hours with Joy, His Head with Glory, and his Arms with Conquest; Set his firm Foot upon the Neck of Tyrants, And be his Name the Balm of every Lip That breathes thro' Sweden! Worthiest to be stil'd Their Friend, their Chief, their Father, and their King! SCENE VIII. Enter Trollio. Troll. Unbind your Prisoner. Arv. How? Troll. You have your Liberty, And may depart unquestion'd. Arv. Do not mock me. It is not to be thought, while Pow'r remains, That Cristiern wants a Reason to be cruel. But let him know I wou'd not be oblig'd. He who accepts the Favours of a Tyrant Shares in his Guilt; they leave a Stain behind them. Troll. You wrong the native Temper of his Soul; Cruel of Force, but never of Election: Prudence compell'd him to a Shew of Tyranny; Howe'er those Politicks are now no more, And Mercy in her Turn shall shine on Sweden. Arv. Indeed! It were a strange, a bless'd Reverse, Devoutly to be wish'd, but then the Cause, The Cause, my Lord, must surely be uncommon. May I presume? Perhaps a Secret. Troll. No—or if it were, The Boldness of thy Spirit claims Respect, And shou'd be answer'd. Know, the only Man, In whom our Monarch ever knew Repulse, Is now our Friend; that Terror of the Field, Th' invincible Gustavus. Arv. Ha! Friend to Cristiern? Guard thyself my Heart! [Aside. Nor seem to take Alarm—Why, good my Lord, What Terror is there in a Wretch proscrib'd, Naked of Means, and distant as Gustavus? Troll. There you mistake—Nor knew we till this Hour The Danger was so near—From yonder Hill He sends Proposals, back'd with all the Pow'rs Of Dalecarlia, those licentious Resolutes, Who, having nought to hazard in the Wreck, Are ever foremost to foment a Storm. Arv. I were too bold to question on the Terms. Troll. No—trust me valiant Man, whoe'er thou art, I wou'd do much to win a Worth like thine, By any Act of Service, or of Confidence. The Terms Gustavus claims, indeed, are haughty; The Freedom of his Mother and his Sister, His forfeit Province, Gothland, and the Isles Submitted to his Sceptre—But the League, The Bond of Amity, and lasting Friendship, Is, that he claims Cristina for his Bride. You start, and seem surpriz'd. Arv. A sudden Pain Just struck athwart my Breast—But say, my Lord, I thought you nam'd Cristina. Troll. Yes. Arv. O Torture! [Aside. What of her, my good Lord? Troll. I said, Gustavus claim'd her for his Bride. Arv. His Bride! his Wife! You did not mean his Wife! Do Fiends feel this? [Aside. Down, Heart, nor tell thy Anguish! Pray excuse me, Did you not say, the Princess was his Wife? Whose Wife, my Lord? Troll. I did not say what was, but what must be. Arv. Touching Gustavus, was it not? Troll. The same. Arv. His Bride! Troll. I say his Bride, his Wife; his lov'd Cristina! Cristina, fancied in the very Prime And youthful Smile of Nature; form'd for Joys Unknown to Mortals. You seem indispos'd. Arv. The Crime of Constitution—Oh Gustavus! [Aside. This is too much!—And think you then, my Lord— What, will the royal Cristiern e'er consent To match his Daughter with his deadliest Foe? Troll. What shou'd he do? War else must be eternal. Besides, some Rumours from his Danish Realms Make Peace essential here. Arv. Yes, Peace has Sweets, That Hybla never knew; it sleeps on Down, Cull'd gently from beneath the Cherub's Wing; No Bed for Mortals—Man is Warfare—All A Hurricane within; yet Friendship stoops, And gilds the Gloom with Falshood—Smiles and Varnish! For still the Storm grows high, and then no Shore! No Rock to split on! 'Twere a kind Perdition To sink ten thousand Fathom at a Plunge, And fasten on Oblivion—there we hold And all is— [Faints. Troll. Help, bear him up. O Potency of Love! That plucks this noble Fabrick from his Base. Bend, bend him forward—He revives—How fare you? Arv. I know not—yet a Dagger were most friendly. Return me, Trollio, O return me back To Death, to Racks! Undone, undone Arvida! Troll. Is't possible, my Lord! the Prince Arvida! My Friend! [Embraces him. Arv. Confusion to the Name! [Turns. Troll. Why this, good Heav'n? And wherefore thus disguis'd? Arv. Yes, that accomplish'd Traitor, that Gustavus; While he sat planning private Scenes of Happiness, O well dissembled! He, he sent me hither; My friendly, unsuspecting Heart a Sacrifice, To make Death sure, and rid him of a Rival. Troll. A Rival! Do you then love Cristiern's Daughter? Arv. Name her not, Trollio; since she can't be mine: Gustavus! how, ah! how hast thou deceiv'd me! Who could have look'd for Falshood from thy Brow? Whose heav'nly Arch was as the Throne of Virtue, Thy Eye appear'd a Sun to chear the World, Thy Bosom Truth's fair Palace, and thy Arms, Benevolent, the Harbour for Mankind. Troll. What's to be done? Believe me, valiant Prince, I know not which most sways me to thy Int'rests, My Love to thee, or Hatred to Gustavus. Arv. Wou'd you then save me? Think, contrive it quickly! Lend me your Troops—by all the Pow'rs of Vengeance, Myself will face this Terror of the North, This Son of Fame—this—O Gustavus—What? Where had I wander'd?—Stab my bleeding Country! Save, shield me from that Thought. Troll. Retire, my Lord; For see, the Princess comes. Arv. Where, Trollio, where? Ha! Yes, she comes indeed! her Beauties drive Time, Place, and Truth, and Circumstance before them! Perdition pleases there—pull—tear me from her! Yet must I gaze—but one—but one Look more, And I were lost for ever. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. Enter Cristina, Mariana, and Attendants. Cristina. Forbid it Shame! Forbid it Virgin Modesty! No, no, my Friend, Gustavus ne'er shall know it. O I am over-paid with conscious Pleasure; The Sense but to have sav'd that wond'rous Man, Is still a smiling Cherub in my Breast, And whispers Peace within. Mar. 'Tis strange a Man, of his high Note and Consequence, Shou'd so evade the busy Search of Thousands; That six long Months have shut him from Enquiry, And not an Eye can trace him to his Covert. Cristina. Once 'twas not so, each Infant lisp'd, Gustavus! It was the fav'rite Name of ev'ry Language, His slightest Motions fill'd the World with Tidings; Wak'd he, or slept, Fame watch'd th' important Hour, And Nations told it round. Mar. I've heard, my Princess, What Time Gustavus lay detain'd in Denmark, Your royal Father sought the Hero's Friendship, And offer'd ample Terms of Peace and Amity. Cristina. He did; he offer'd that, my Mariana, For which contending Monarchs su'd in vain, He offer'd me, his Darling, his Cristina; But I was slighted, slighted by a Captive, Tho' Kingdoms swell'd my Dower. Mar. Amazement fix me, Rejected by Gustavus! Cristina. Yes, Mariana;—but rejected nobly. Not Worlds cou'd win him to betray his Country! Had he consented, I had then despis'd him. What's all the gaudy Glitter of a Crown? What, but the glaring Meteor of Ambition, That leads a Wretch benighted in his Errors, Points to the Gulph, and shines upon Destruction. Mar. You wrong your Charms, whose Pow'r might reconcile Things opposite in Nature—Had he seen you!— Cristina. He has, my Mariana, he has seen me. I'll tell thee—yet while inexpert of Years, I heard of bloody Spoils, the Waste of War, And dire conflicting Man; Gustavus' Name Superior rose, still dreadful in the Tale: Then first he seiz'd my Infancy of Soul, As somewhat fabl'd of gigantic Fierceness, Too huge for any Form; he scar'd my Sleep, And fill'd my young Idea. Not the Boast Of all his Virtues, Graces only known To him, and heav'nly Natures! cou'd erase The strong Impression; 'till that wond'rous Day In which he met my Eyes. But O, O Heav'n! O Love, and all ye cordial Pow'rs of Passion! What then was my Amazement! he was chain'd, Was chain'd, my Mariana! Like the Robes Of Coronation, worn by youthful Kings, He drew his Shackles. The Herculean Nerve Braced his young Arm; and soften'd in his Cheek Liv'd more than Woman's Sweetness! Then his Eye! His Mein! his native Dignity! He look'd, As tho' he led Captivity in Chains, And all were Slaves around. Mar. Did he observe you? Cristina. He did: for as I trembl'd, look'd and sigh'd; His Eyes met mine; he fix'd their Glories on me. Confusion thrill'd me then, and secret Joy, Fast throbbing, stole its Treasures from my Heart, And mantling upward, turn'd my Face to Crimson. I wish'd—but did not dare to look—he gaz'd; When sudden, as by Force, he turn'd away, And would no more behold me. SCENE X. Enter Laertes. Laer. Ah, bright imperial Maid! my royal Mistress! Cristina. What wou'dst thou say? Thy Looks speak Terror to me. Laer. O you are ruin'd, sacrific'd, undone! I heard it all; your cruel, cruel Father Has sold you, giv'n you up a Spoil to Treason, The Purchase of the noblest Blood on Earth— Gustavus!— Cristina. Eh! What of him? Where, where is he? Laer. In Dalecarlia, on some great Design, Doom'd in an Hour to fall by faithless Hands: His Friend, the brave, the false, deceiv'd Arvida, Ev'n now prepares to lead a Band of Ruffians Beneath the winding Covert of the Hill, And seize Gustavus, obvious to the Snares Of Friendship's fair Dissemblance. And your Father Has vow'd your Beauties to Arvida's Arms, The Purchase of his Falsehood. Cristina. Shield me Heav'n! First Duty, break thy filial Bands in sunder, And blot the Name of Parent from the World! Is there no Lett, no Means of quick Prevention? Laer. Behold my Life still chain'd to thy Direction, My Will shall have a Wing for ev'ry Word, That breathes thy Mandate. Cristina. Will you, good Laertes? Alas, I fear to overtask thy Friendship, Say, will you save me then—O go, haste, fly! Acquaint Gustavus—if, if he must fall, Let Hosts that hem this single Lion in, Let Nations hunt him down—let him fall nobly. Laer. I go, my Princess—Heav'n direct me to him! [Exit. Cristina. I wou'd pray too, to save me from Pollution; Detested Stain, the Touch of the Betrayer! But mighty Love the partial Pray'r arrests, And leaves me only anxious for Gustavus. For him cold Fears my fainting Bosom chill, His Cares distract me, and his Dangers kill; Ye Pow'rs! if deaf to all the Vows I make, Yet shield Gustavus, for Gustavus' Sake; Protect his Virtues from a faithless Foe, And save your only Image, left below. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE Mountains of Dalecarlia. Enter Gustavus as a Peasant—Dalecarlians following. Gust. Ye Men of Sweden, wherefore are ye come? See ye not yonder, how the Locusts swarm, To drink the Fountains of your Honour up, And leave your Hills a Desart—Wretched Men! Why came ye forth? Is this a Time for Sport? Or are ye met with Song and jovial Feast, To welcome your new Guests, your Danish Visitants? To stretch your supple Necks beneath their Feet, And fawning lick the Dust?—Go, go, my Countrymen, Each to your several Mansions, trim them out, Cull all the tedious Earnings of your Toil To purchase Bondage—Bid your blooming Daughters, And your chaste Wives to spread their Beds with Softness; Then go ye forth, and with your proper Hands Conduct your Masters in; conduct the Sons Of Lust and Violation—O Swedes, Swedes! Heav'ns! are ye Men, and will ye suffer this? SCENE II. Enter Arnoldus, who talks apart with Gustavus. 1st Dale. How my Blood boils! 2d Dale. Who is this honest Spokesman? 3d Dale. What, know ye not Rodolphus of the Mines? A better Lab'rer ne'er struck Steel to Stone. Gust. There was a Time, my Friends! a glorious Time; When, had a single Man of your Forefathers Upon the Frontier met a Host in Arms, His Courage scarce had turn'd; himself had stood, Alone had stood the Bulwark of his Country. Your Sires were known but by their manly Fronts, On their black Brows, enthron'd, sat Liberty, The Awe of Honour, and Contempt of Death. 1st Dale. We are not Bastards. 2d Dale. No. 3d Dale. We're Dalecarlians. Gust. Come, come ye on then: Here I take my Stand! Here on the Brink, the very Verge of Liberty; Altho' Contention rise upon the Clouds, Mix Heav'n with Earth, and roll the Ruin onward; Here will I fix, and breast me to the Shock, 'Till I, or Denmark fall. Siv. And who art thou? That thus wou'dst swallow all the Glory up That shou'd redeem the Times? Behold this Breast, The Sword has till'd it; and the Stripes of Slaves Shall ne'er trace Honour here; shall never blot The fair Inscription—Never shall the Cords Of Danish Insolence bind down these Arms That bore my royal Master from the Field. Gust. Ha! Say you, Brother? Were you there—O Grief! Where Liberty and Stenon fell together? Siv. Yes, I was there—A bloody Field it was, Where Conquest gasp'd, and wanted Breath to tell, Its o'er-toil'd Triumph. There, our bleeding King, There Stenon on this Bosom made his Bed, And rolling back his dying Eyes upon me; Soldier, he cried, if e'er it be thy Lot To see my valiant Cousin, great Gustavus, Tell him—for once, that I have fought like him, And wou'd like him have— Conquer'd—he shou'd have said—but there, O there, Death sto—pt him short. Gust. Come to my Arms, and let me hide thy Tears, For I have caught their Softness—O Danes, Danes! You shall weep Blood for this. Shall they not, Brother? Yes, we will deal our Might with thrifty Vengeance, A Life for ev'ry Blow, and when we fall, There shall be Weight in't; like the tott'ring Tow'rs That draw contiguous Ruin. Siv. Brave, brave Man! My Soul admires thee—By my Father's Spirit, I wou'd not barter such a Death as this For Immortality! Nor we alone— Here be the trusty Gleanings of that Field Where last we fought for Freedom; here's rich Poverty, Tho' wrapp'd in Rags, my fifty brave Companions; Who thro' the Force of fifteen thousand Foes Bore off their King, and sav'd his great Remains. Gust. Give me your Hands, those valiant Hands—Why, Captain, We could but die alone, with these we'll conquer. My fellow Lab'rers too—What say ye, Friends? Shall we not strike for't? All. Death; Victory or Death! No Bonds, no Bonds! Arn. Spoke like yourselves—Ye Men of Dalecarlia, Brave Men and bold! Whom ev'ry future Age, Tongues, Nations, Languages, and Rolls of Fame Shall mark for wond'rous Deeds, Atchievements won From Honour's dang'rous Summit, Warriors all! Say, might ye chuse a Chief, for high Exploits, From the first Annal, to the latest Praise That breathes a Hero's Name—Speak, name the Man Who then should meet your Wish? Siv. Forbear the Theme. Why wou'dst thou seek to sink us with the Weight Of grievous Recollection? O Gustavus! Cou'd the dead wake, thou wert that Man of Men, First of the Foremost. Gust. Didst thou know Gustavus? Siv. Know him! O Heav'n! what else, who else was worth The Knowledge of a Soldier? That great Day, When Cristiern, in his third Attempt on Sweden, Had sum'd his Pow'rs and weigh'd the Scale of Fight: On the bold Brink, the very Push of Conquest, Gustavus rush'd, and bore the Battle down; In his full Sway of Prowess, like Leviathan That scoops his foaming Progress on the Main, And drives the Shoals along—forward I sprung, All emulous, and lab'ring to attend him; Fear fled before, behind him Rout grew loud, And distant Wonder gaz'd—At length he turn'd, And having ey'd me with a wond'rous Look Of Sweetness mix'd with Glory—Grace inestimable! He pluck'd this Bracelet from his conq'ring Arm And bound it here—My Wrist seem'd treble nerv'd; My Heart spoke to him, and I did such Deeds As best might thank him—But from that bless'd Day I never saw him more—yet still to this, I bow, as to the Relicks of my Saint: Each Morn I drop a Tear on ev'ry Bead, Count all the Glories of Gustavus o'er, And think I still behold him. Gust. Rightly thought; For so thou dost, my Soldier. Give me my Arms—Off, off ye dark Disguises! For I will be myself. Behold your General, Gustavus! Come once more to lead ye on To laurel'd Victory, to Fame, to Freedom! 1st Dale. Is it? 2d Dale. Yes. 3d Dale. No. 4th Dale. 'Tis he! 5th Dale. 'Tis he! 6th Dale. 'Tis he! [A Shout. Siv. Strike me, ye Pow'rs!—It is Illusion all! It cannot. Gust. What, no nearer? Siv. 'Tis, it is!— [Falls and embraces his Knees. Gust. O speechless Eloquence! Rise to my Arms, my Friend. Siv. Friend! said you Friend? O my Heart's Lord! My Conq'rer! my!— Gust. Approach, my fellow Soldiers, your Gustavus Claims no Precedence here: Friendship like mine Throws all Respects behind it—'tis enough— I read your Joys, your Transports in your Eyes; And wou'd, O, wou'd I had a Life to spend, For ev'ry Soldier here! whose ev'ry Life's Far dearer than my own; dearer than aught, Except your Liberty, except your Honour. Perish Gustavus, 'ere this sacred Sun, That lights the rest of Sweden to their Shame, Should blush upon your Chains! why said I Chains! To Souls like yours, I should have talk'd of Triumphs, Empire, and Fame, and Hazards imminent, Occasions wish'd, for Glory—haste, brave Men! Collect your Friends to join us on the Instant; Summon our Brethren to their Share of Conquest, And let loud Eccho, from her circling Hills, Sound Freedom, 'till the Undulation shake The Bounds of utmost Sweden. [Exeunt Dalecarlians, crying Gustavus, Gustavus, Liberty. SCENE III. Enter Anderson. And. There was a glorious Sound! Gust. Yes, Anderson, The long wish'd Hour is come—the Storm is up, And Wrecks will follow—Where they are to light Let Heav'n determine—Well, my noble Friend, Has Peterson set out? And. He has, this Instant: And bears your Pacquet to the Tyrant's Camp. Gust. What think you of his Zeal? And. In truth, my Lord, It wears a gallant Show. Gust. 'Tis specious all, Flash without Fire, the Light'ning of a Cloud That carries Darkness in the Rear—For Peterson, To spread my Letters thro' the Camp of Cristiern, And seek for Succours in the Jaws of Death, It show'd too bold, too much the flaming Patriot. Beside, I know him for the Friend of Trollio. And. Why wou'd you then employ him? Gust. There's the Mystery. 'Tis not his Faith, but Treachery I trust to. My Letters are directed to the Chiefs Of those inglorious Mercenary Swedes, Whom Cristiern has seduced to join his Host, And turn the Sword of Conquest on their Country; To each of those I have address'd in Terms Of special Correspondence, meant to rouze The Jealousy of Cristiern; as I think My Pacquet can't escape him—What ensues? The Tyrant hence concludes himself betray'd, Sifts all his Legions, thins the Ranks of Fight, And leaves them open to our bold Invasion. But grant that Peterson deceive my Aim, And hold the Rank of Virtue; then the Swedes May waken to the glorious Call of Honour. So—ev'ry Way it saves us from the Guilt Of Swedes encount'ring Swedes, and spares the Blood Of Brethren, tho' revolted. And. On my Soul, This is a Stratagem that saps the Miner, Makes Treason turn a Traitor to itself; And mock its own Designs. Gust. O noble Friend, fast winds the great Machine That strikes the Fate of Sweden—Go, my Anderson, Assemble all thy brave Adherents round thee, With warlike Inspiration warm their Souls, And haste to join me here. And. I will, my Lord. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter Laertes. Laer. Thy Presence nobly speaks the Man I wish, Gustavus. Gust. Yes. Thou hast a hostile Garb, Ha! say—Art thou Laertes? If I err not, There is a friendly Semblance in that Face, Which answers to a fond Impression here, And tells me I'm thy Debtor—my Deliv'rer! Laer. No, valiant Prince, you over-rate my Service, There is a worthier Object of your Gratitude Whom yet you know not—O, I have to tell— But then to gain your Credit, must unfold What haply should be secret—Be it so; You are all Honour. Gust. Let me to thy Mind, For thou hast wak'd my Soul into a Thought That holds me, all Attention. Laer. Mightiest Man! To me alone you held yourself oblig'd For Life and Liberty—Had it been so, I were most bless'd, with Retribution just To pay thee for my own—For on the Day When by your Arm the mighty Thraces fell, Fate threw me to your Sword—You spar'd my Youth, And in the very Whirl and Rage of Fight Your Eye was taught Compassion—from that Hour I vow'd my Life the Slave of your Rememb'rance; And often, as Cristina, heav'nly Maid! The Mistress of my Service, question'd me Of Wars and vent'rous Deeds, my Tidings came Still freighted with thy Name, until the Day In which yourself appear'd, to make Praise speechless. Cristina saw you then, and on your Fate Dropp'd a kind Tear; and when your noble Scorn Of profer'd Terms provok'd her Father's Rage To take the deadly Forfeit; she, she only, Whose Virtues watch'd the precious Hour of Mercy, All trembling, sent my secret Hand to save you; Where, thro' a Pass unknown to all your Keepers, I led you forth, and gave you to your Liberty. Gust. O I am sunk, o'erwhelm'd with wond'rous Goodness, But were I rich and free as opening Mines That teem their golden Wealth upon the World, Still I were poor, unequal to her Bounty. Nor can I longer doubt whose gen'rous Arm In my Arvida, in my Friend's Deliverance, Gave double Life, and Freedom to Gustavus. Laer. A fatal Present! Ah, you know him not; Arvida is misled, undone by Passion; False to your Friendship, to your Trust unfaithful. Gust. Ha! hold! Laer. I must unfold it. Gust. Yet forbear: This Way—I hear some footing—pray you soft— If thou hast aught to urge against Arvida, The Man of Virtue, tell it not the Wind; Lest Slander catch the Sound, and Guilt should triumph. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Arvida entering speaks to a Soldier. Arv. He's here—bear back my Orders to your Fellows That not a Man, on Peril of his Life, Advance in Sight 'till call'd. Sold. My Lord, I will— Arv. Have I not vow'd it, faithless as he is, Have I not vow'd his Fall? Yet, good Heav'n! Why start these sudden Tears? On, on I must, For I am half way down the dizzy Steep, Where my Brain turns—A Draught of Lethe now— O that the World wou'd sleep—to wake no more! Or that the Name of Friendship bore no Charm To make my Nerve unsteady, and this Steel Flee backward from its Task!—It shall be done.— Empire! Cristina! tho' th' affrighted Sun Start back with Horror of the direful Stroke, It shall be done. Calm, calm the Hell within, Thy Looks may else turn Traitors—Ha, he comes! How steadily he looks, as Heav'n's own Book, The Leaf of Truth, were open'd on his Aspect. Up, up, dark Minister—his Fate call out [Puts up the Dagger. To nobler Execution; for he comes In Opposition, singly, Man to Man, As tho' he brav'd my Wish. SCENE VI. Enter Gustavus. [They look for some time on each other—Arvida lays his Hand on his Sword, and withdraws it by Turns—then advances irresolutely. Gust. Is it then so? Arv. Defend thyself. Gust. No—strike— I would unfold my Bosom to thy Sword, But that I know the Wound you give this Breast Would doubly pierce thy own. Arv. I know thee not— It is the Time's Eclipse, and what should be In Nature, now is nameless. Gust. Ah, my Brother! Arv. What wouldst thou? Gust. Is it thus we two should meet? Arv. Art thou not false? Deep else, O deep indeed Were my Damnation. Gust. Dear, unhappy Man! My Heart bleeds for thee. False I'd surely been, Had I like thee been tempted. Arv. Ha! Speak, speak, Didst thou not send to treat with Cristiern? Gust. Never. I know thy Error, but I know the Arts, The Frauds, the Wiles that practis'd on thy Virtue; Firm how you stood, and tow'r'd above Mortality; 'Till in the fond unguarded Hour of Love, The wily undermining Trollio came, And won thee from thyself—a Moment won thee— For still thou art Arvida, still the Man On whom thy Country calls for her Deliv'rance. Already are her bravest Sons in Arms, Mark how they shout, impatient of our Presence, To lead them on to a new Life of Liberty, To Fame, to Conquest—Ha, Heav'n guard my Brother, Thy Cheek turns pale, thy Eye is wild upon me, Wilt thou not answer me? Arv. Gustavus! Gust. Speak. Arv. Have I not dream'd? Gust. No other I esteem it. Where lives the Man whose Reason slumbers not? Still pure, still blameless, if at wonted Dawn Again he wakes to Virtue. Arv. O, my Dawn Must soon be dark. Confusion dissipates, To leave me worse confounded. Gust. Think no more on't. Come to my Arms, thou dearest of Mankind! Arv. Stand off! Pollution dwells within my Touch, And Horror hangs around me—Cruel Man! O, thou hast doubly damn'd me with this Goodness; For Resolution held the Deed as done; That now must sink me—Hark! I'm summon'd hence, My Audit opens! Poise me! for I stand Upon a Spire, against whose sightless Base Hell breaks his Wave beneath. Down, down I dare not, And up I cannot look, for Justice fronts me.— Thou shalt have Vengeance, tho' my purpling Blood Were Nectar for Heav'n's Bowl, as warm and rich, As now 'tis base, it thus should pour for Pardon. [Gustavus catches his Arm, and in the Struggle the Dagger falls. Gust. Ha! Hold, Arvida—No, I will not lose thee— Forbid it Heav'n! thou shalt not rob me so, No, I will struggle with thee to the last, And save thee from thyself. Oh, answer me! Wilt thou forsake me? Answer me, my Brother, My best Arvida. Arv. I wou'd speak to thee— But let it be by Silence—Oh Gustavus! Gust. Say but you'll live. Arv. Oh! Gust. For my Sake. Arv. Yes, take me; Expose me, cage me, brand me for the Tool Of crafted Villains, for the veriest Slave, On whom the Bend of each contemptuous Brow Shall look with Loathing. Ah, my Turpitude Shall be the vile Comparative for Knaves To boast and whiten by! Gust. Not so, not so. Who knows no Fault, my Friend, knows no Perfection. The Rectitude that Heav'n appoints to Man Leads on thro' Error; and the kindly Sense Of having stray'd, endears the Road to Bliss; It makes Heav'n's Way more pleasing! O my Brother, 'Tis hence a Thousand cordial Charities Derive their Growth, their Vigour, and their Sweetness. This short Lapse Shall to thy future Foot give cautious Treading, Erect and firm in Virtue. Arv. Give me Leave. [Offers to pass. Gust. You shall not pass. Arv. I must. Gust. Whither? Arv. I know not—O Gustavus! Gust. Speak. Arv. You can't forgive me. Gust. Not forgive thee! Arv. No. Look there. [Points to the Dagger. And yet when I resolv'd to kill thee I cou'd have died—indeed I cou'd—for thee, I cou'd have died, Gustavus! Gust. O I know it. A gen'rous Mind, tho' sway'd a-while by Passion. Is like the steely Vigour of the Bow, Still holds its native Rectitude, and bends But to recoil more forceful. Come forget it. SCENE VII. Enter a Dalecarlian. Dale. My Lord, as now I pass'd the Mountain's Brow, I spy'd some Men, whose Arms, and strange Attire, Give Cause for Circumspection. Gust. Danes, perhaps; Haste, intercept their Passage to the Camp. [Ex. Dal. Arv. Those are the Danes that witness to my Shame. Gust. Perish th' opprobrious Term! not so, Arvida; Myself will be the Guardian of thy Fame; Trust me, I will—Our Friends approach—O clear While I attend them, clear that Cloud, my Brother, That sits upon the Morning of thy Youth; It hangs too near the Heart of thy Gustavus. [Exit. Arv. Of thy Gustavus! O Wretch, Wretch, curs'd Wretch! What is this Time and Place, and Toys of Circumstance; That wind our Actions, so, as Heav'n's own Hand What's done may not unravel?—Pardon may!— There's the Lethean Sweet, the Snow of Heav'n, New blanching-o'er the Negro Front of Guilt, That to the Eye of Mercy all appears Fair as th' unwritten Page—yet self-convict, Tho' Heav'n's free Pow'r shou'd pardon, where's my Peace? Thus, thus to be driven out from my own Breast! To have no Shed, no shelt'ring Nook at Home To take Reflection in! How looks the Wretch Whose Heart cries Villain to itself? I'll not Endure its Batt'ry—Somewhat must be done Of high Import 'ere Night, that I may sleep, Or wake for ever. SCENE VIII. Enter Gustavus follow'd by the Dalecarlians, Anderson, Arnoldus, Sivard, Officers, &amp;c. 1st Dale. Let us all see him! 2d Dale. Yes, and hear him too. 3d Dale. Let us be sure 'tis he himself. 4th Dale. Our General. 5th Dale. And we will fight while Weapons can be found. 6th Dale. Or Hands to wield them. 7th Dale. Get on the Bank, Gustavus. And. Do, my Lord. Gust. My Countrymen!— 1st Dale. Ho! hear him. 2d Dale. Peace! 3d Dale. Peace! 4th Dale. Peace! Gust. Amazement I perceive hath fill'd your Hearts, And Joy for that your lost Gustavus, 'scap'd Thro' Wounds, Imprisonments, and Chains, and Deaths, Thus sudden, thus unlook'd for stands before ye. As one escap'd from cruel Hands I come, From Hearts that ne'er knew Pity; dark and vengeful: Who quaff the Tears of Orphans, bathe in Blood, And know no Musick but the Groans of Sweden. Yet, not for that my Sister's early Innocence, And Mother's Age now grind beneath Captivity; Nor that one bloody, one remorseless Hour Swept my great Sire, and Kindred from my Side; For them Gustavus weeps not, tho' my Eyes Were far less dear, for them I will not weep. But, O great Parent, when I think on thee! Thy numberless, thy nameless, shameful Infamies, My widow'd Country! Sweden! when I think Upon thy Desolation, Spite of Rage— And Vengeance that would choak them—Tears will flow. And. O, they are Villains, ev'ry Dane of them, Practis'd to stab and smile; to stab the Babe That smiles upon them. Arn. What accursed Hours Roll o'er those Wretches who to Fiends like these In their dear Liberty have barter'd more Than Worlds will rate for? Gust. O Liberty, Heav'n's choice Prerogative! True Bond of Law, thou social Soul of Property, Thou Breath of Reason, Life of Life itself! For thee the Valiant bleed. O sacred Liberty! Wing'd from the Summer's Snare, from flatt'ring Ruin, Like the bold Stork you seek the wint'ry Shore, Leave Courts, and Pomps, and Palaces to Slaves, Cleave to the Cold, and rest upon the Storm. Upborn by thee, my Soul disdain'd the Terms Of Empire—offer'd at the Hands of Tyrants. With thee, I sought this fav'rite Soil; with thee, These fav'rite Sons I sought; thy Sons, O Liberty. For ev'n amid the Wilds of Life you lead them, Lift their low rafted Cottage to the Clouds, Smile o'er their Heaths, and from their Mountain Tops Beam Glory to the Nations. All. Liberty! Liberty! Gust. Are ye not mark'd, ye Men of Dalecarlia, Are ye not mark'd by all the circling World As the great Stake, the last Effort for Liberty? Say, is it not your Wealth, the Thirst, the Food, The Scope and bright Ambition of your Souls? Why else have you, and your renown'd Forefathers, From the proud Summit of their glitt'ring Thrones, Cast down the mightiest of your lawful Kings That dar'd the bold Infringement? What, but Liberty, Thro' the fam'd Course of thirteen hundred Years, Aloof hath held Invasion from your Hills, And sanctify'd their Shade?—And will ye, will ye Shrink from the Hopes of the expecting World; Bid your high Honours stoop to foreign Insult, And in one Hour give up to Infamy The Harvest of a thousand Years of Glory? 1st Dale. No. 2d Dale. Never, never. 3d Dale. Perish all first! 4th Dale. Die all! Gust. Yes, die by Piecemeal! Leave not a Limb o'er which a Dane may triumph! Now from my Soul I joy, I joy, my Friends, To see ye fear'd; to see that ev'n your Foes Do Justice to your Valours!—There they be, The Pow'rs of Kingdoms, summ'd in yonder Host, Yet kept aloof, yet trembling to assail ye. And O, when I look round and see you here, Of Number short, but prevalent in Virtue, My Heart swells high and burns for the Encounter True Courage but from Opposition grows; And what are fifty, what a thousand Slaves, Match'd to the Sinew of a single Arm That strikes for Liberty? That strikes to save His Fields from Fire, his Infants from the Sword, His Couch from Lust, his Daughters from Pollution; And his large Honours from eternal Infamy? What, doubt we then? Shall we, shall we stand here 'Till Motives that might warm an Ague's Frost, And nerve the Coward's Arm, shall poorly serve To wake us to Resistance?—Let us on! O, yes, I read your lovely fierce Impatience; You shall not be withheld; we will rush on them— This is indeed to triumph, where we hold Three Kingdoms in our Toil! Is it not glorious,— Thus to appal the Bold, meet Force with Fury, And push yon Torrent back, 'till ev'ry Wave Flee to its Fountain? 3d Dale. On, lead us on, Gustavus; one Word more Is but Delay of Conquest. Gust. Take your Wish. He, who wants Arms, may grapple with the Foe And so be furnish'd. You, most noble Anderson, Divide our Pow'rs, and with the fam'd Olaus Take the left Rout—You, Eric, great in Arms! With the renown'd Nederbi, hold the Right, And skirt the Forest down; then wheel at once, Confess'd to view, and close upon the Vale: Myself, and my most valiant Cousin here Th' invincible Arvida, gallant Sivard, Arnoldus, and these hundred hardy Vet'rans Will pour directly on, and lead the Onset. Joy, Joy, I see confess'd from ev'ry Eye, Your Limbs tread vigorous, and your Breasts beat high! Thin tho' our Ranks, tho' scanty be our Bands, Bold are our Hearts, and nervous are our Hands. With us, Truth, Justice, Fame, and Freedom close, Each, singly equal to an Host of Foes, I feel, I feel them fill me out for Fight, They lift my Limbs as feather'd Hermes light! Or like the Bird of Glory, tow'ring high, Thunder within his Grasp, and Light'ning in his Eye! End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE before the Camp. Enter Cristiern, Trollio, and Attendants. Crist. Your Observation's just, I see it, Trollio: Men are Machines, with all their boasted Freedom, Their Movements turn upon some fav'rite Passion; Let Art but find the latent Foible out, We touch the Spring, and wind them at our Pleasure. Troll. Let Heav'n spy out for Virtue, and then starve it: But Vice and Frailty are the Statesman's Quarry, The Objects of our Search, and of our Science; Mark'd by our Smiles, and cherish'd by our Bounty. 'Tis hence, you lord it o'er your servile Senates; How low the Slaves will stoop to gorge their Lusts When aptly baited: Ev'n the Tongues of Patriots, (Those Sons of Clamour) oft relax the Nerve Within the Warmth of Favour. Crist. How else should Kings subsist? For what is Pow'r, But the nice Conduct of another's Weakness? That Thing call'd Virtue is the Bane of Government, A Libel on the State, that asks Suppression; It has a hateful and unbending Quality; It serves no End, still restive to the Rein, And to the Spur unspeedy: They who boast it Are Traitors, Rivals of their King, my Trollio, And, wanting other Subjects, greatly dare To lord it o'er themselves. Such is Gustavus, If yet he be— And such Arvida was; tho' now, I trust, He is too far advanc'd in our Designs To think of a Retreat. Troll. Impossible! Already has he leap'd the guilty Mound That might appal his Virtue; for the World He dare not now look back; where Shame pursues, And cuts off all Retreat. SCENE II. Enter Gentleman Usher and Peterson, who kneels. Gent. My Liege, Lord Peterson. Crist. Rise to our Trust, most worthy Peterson; Rise to our Friendship: By my Head, I swear, Bar but our Trollio here, there's not a Swede, Who holds thy valued Level in our Heart! For thou'rt unshaken, tho' thy Nation swerve; Faithful among the faithless. Peter. What I am Let this inform your Majesty. [Gives a Pacquet. Troll. A Pacquet! Whence had you that, my Friend? Peter. Even from the Hands Of the once great Gustavus. Crist. Then you have seen him. Tell me, tell me, Peterson, What said he? Eh! How look'd the mighty Rebel? His Means, his Scope, the Pride of his Presumption, Give me the whole! Peter. Last Night, my gracious Lord, While yet I held your Messenger in Conference; Arriv'd, who brought a Letter from Gustavus, Wherein, digesting many flagrant Terms Of mutinous Import against the State Of your high Dignity; by Morning Light He pray'd me to attend him; boasting much Of plenteous Hopes, and Means of boldest Enterprize. Of this I gave you Notice; and 'ere Dawn Set out for fresh Intelligence—I came; I saw him shrunk, that Glory of the North, Soil'd with the Vileness of a Slave's Attire; Where in the Depth and Darkness of the Mines, For six long Months he hath not seen the Sun; Colleagu'd with circling Horrors; hourly Toil Hath been his Watch, and Penury his Earning; But like the Lion, newly broke from Bonds, The mingling Passions from his Eyes dart Glory; Pride lifts his Stature, and his opening Front Still looks Dominion. Crist. Who were his Adherents? Peter. The Traitor Anderson, and a few Friends, To whom, 'ere I set out, he stood reveal'd. And when I seem'd to question on his Pow'rs Of Rivalship, the Props whereon he meant To lift Contention to the princely Front Of such high Opposition; he reply'd, His Powers were near your Person. Crist. How! what's here? [Looks on the Pacquet. To Laurens, Aland, Haquin, and Roderic, Confusion! Treason's in our Camp! Who's there? Gent. My Liege! Crist. Bear this to Norbi—Bid him seize [Gives a Signet. The Swedish Captains. Troll. Might I but presume— Crist. I will not be controul'd—bid him seize all, Soldiers and Chiefs! By Hell, there's not a Swede, But lurks an Instrument to prompt Rebellion, And Plots upon my Life! Look there, 'tis evident: [Gives Trollio a Letter. They are all leagu'd, confed'rate with Gustavus, Th' Abettors of his Treason. Troll. It shou'd seem so: And yet it shou'd not—Tell me, Peterson, Art thou assur'd thy Credit with Gustavus Will answer to a Trust like this?—Ha! Say. Peter. Yes, well assur'd: My Zeal appear'd too warm To give the least cold Colour for Suspicion. Troll. I fear, my Friend, I fear he has o'er-reach'd you. Divide and conquer, is the Sum of Politics. Beyond the dreaded Circle of his Sword, Gustavus triumphs in an ample Genius; He walks at large, sees clear and wide around him; Calm in the Storm and Turbulence of Action; He ponders on the last Event of Things, And makes each Cause subservient to the Consequence. Crist. You over-rate his Craft; they're false, my Trollio, False ev'ry Swede of them; I read their Souls. SCENE III. Enter Cristina and Mariana. Cristina. I heard it was your royal Pleasure, Sir, I shou'd attend your Highness. Crist. Yes, Cristina, But Business interferes. SCENE IV. Enter an Officer. Off. My sovereign Liege! Wide o'er the Western Shelving of yon Hill, We think, tho' indistinctly, we can spy, Like Men in Motion must'ring on the Heath; And there is one who saith he can discern, A few of martial Gesture, and bright Arms, Who this Way bend their Action. Crist. Friends, perhaps, For Foes it were too daring—Haste thee, Trollio, Detach a Thousand of our Danish Horse To rule their Motions—We will out ourself, And hold our Pow'rs in Readiness—Lead on. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Enter Cristina and Mariana. Mar. Ha! did you mark, my Princess, did you mark? Shou'd some Reverse, some wond'rous Whirl of Fate Once more return Gustavus to the Battle, New nerve his Arm, and wreathe his Brow with Conquest; Say, wou'd you not repent that e'er you sav'd This dreadful Man, the Foe of your great Race; Who pours impetuous in his Country's Cause To spoil you of a Kingdom? Cristina. No, my Friend. Had I to Death, or Bondage, sold my Sire, Or had Gustavus on our native Realms Made hostile Inroad; then, my Mariana! Had I then sav'd him from the Stroke of Justice, I shou'd not cease my Suit to Heav'n for Pardon. But if, tho' in a Foe, to reverence Virtue, Withstand Oppression, rescue injur'd Innocence, Step boldly in betwixt my Sire and Guilt, And save my King, my Father from Dishonour; If this be Sin, I have shook Hands with Penitence. First, perish Crowns, Dominion, all the Shine And Transience of this World, 'ere Guilt shall serve To buy the vain Incumbrance. Mar. Do not think I meant, my Princess, to arraign your Virtues, Howe'er I seem'd to question on the Consequence. Cristina. The Consequence of Virtue must be good: It must. Tho' it shou'd prove my Father's Lot, In being rescu'd from one Act of Guilt, To lose the whole of all his wide Dominions, He were a Gainer—Blasted be that Royalty, Which Murder must make sure, and Crimes inglorious! The Bulk of Kingdoms, nay, the World is light, When Guilt weighs opposite—O wou'd to Heav'n, The Loss of Empire wou'd restore his Innocence, Restore the Fortunes, and the precious Lives Of Thousands fal'n the Victims of Ambition! SCENE VI. Enter Laertes. [Cristina.] Ha! Laertes! most welcome! well—and have you? Say, Laertes. Laer. O Royal Maid!— Cristina. Thy Looks are doubtful—Speak,— Why art thou silent—Does he live? Laer. He does. But Death 'ere Night must fill a long Account; The Camp, the Country's in Confusion: War, And Changes ride upon the Hour that hastes To intercept my Tongue—I else cou'd tell Of Virtues hitherto beyond my Ken; Courage, to which the Lion stoops his Crest, Yet grafted upon Qualities as soft As a rock'd Infant's Meekness; such as tempts Against my Faith, my Country, and Allegiance, To wish thee Speed, Gustavus. Cristina. Then you found him. Laer. I did: and warn'd him, but in vain; for Death To him appear'd more grateful than to find His Friend's Dishonour. Cristina. Give me the Manner—quick—soft, good Laertes! SCENE VII. Enter Cristiern, Trollio, Peterson, Danes, &amp;c. Crist. Damn'd! double Traitor! O curs'd, false Arvida! Guard well the Swedish Pris'ners, bind them hard— Stand to your Arms—Bring forth the Captives there! SCENE VIII. Enter Agusta and Gustava guarded. Troll. My Liege— Crist. Away! I'll hear no more of Politics; Fortune! we will not trust the Changeling more; But wear her girt upon our armed Loins, Or pointed in our Grasp. SCENE IX. Enter an Officer. Off. The Foe's at hand. With gallant Shew your thousand Danes rode forth, But shall return no more!—I mark'd the Action, A Band of desp'rate Resolutes rush'd on 'em, Scarce numb'ring to a Tenth, and in mid Way They clos'd; the Shock was dreadful, nor your Danes Cou'd bear the madding Charge; a while they stood, Then shrunk, and broke, and turn'd—When, lo, behind, Fast wheeling from the Right and Left there pour'd, Who intercepted their Return, and caught Within the Toil they perish'd. Crist. 'Tis Gustavus! No Mortal else, not Ammon's boasted Son, Not Cæsar wou'd have dar'd it. Tell me, say, What Numbers in the Whole may they amount to? Off. About Five Thousand. Crist. And no more? Off. No more, That yet appear. Crist. We count six times their Sum.— Haste, Soldier, take a Trumpet, tell Gustavus We have of Terms to offer, and wou'd treat Touching his Mother's Ransom; say, her Death, Suspended by our Grace, but waits his Answer. [Exit Officer. Madam, It shou'd well suit with your Authority, [To Agusta. To check this Frenzy in your Son—look to it, Or by the Saints this Hour's your last of Life! Agu. Come, my Gustava, come, my little Captive, We shall be free; our Tyrant is grown kind; And for these Chains that bind thy pretty Arms, The golden Cherubim shall lend thee Wings, And thou shalt mount amid the smiling Choir Of little Heav'nly Songsters, like thyself, All robed in Innocence. Gustava. Will you go, Mother? Agu. So help me, Mercy! Yes, I'll go, my Child; And I will give thee to thy Father's Fondness, And to the Arms of all thy royal Race In Heav'n; who sit on Thrones, with Loves, and Joys, And Pleasures smiling round. Crist. Is this my Answer? Come forth, ye Ministers of Death, come forth, SCENE IX. Enter Ruffians, who seize Agusta and Gustava. Pluck them asunder! We shall prove you, Lady! 'Tis my damn'd Lot, thus ever to be cross'd With rank blown Pride, and Insolence eternal. Gustava. O Mother, take me, take me from these Men, They fright me with their Looks. Agusta. Alas, my Child, I cannot take thee from them. Gustava. O, they will hurt me: can't you take me, Mother? Agusta. They can't, they cannot hurt you, my Gustava. Fear not, my little one, your Name shou'd be A Charm o'er Cowardice, for you are call'd After your valiant Brother; he'll disown you, He will not love you, if you fear, Gustava. Cristina. Ah! I can hold no longer. Royal Sir, Thus on my Knees, and lower, lower still— Crist. My Child! What mean you? Cristina. O my gracious Father! Kill, kill me rather—let me perish first; But do not stain the Sanctity of Kings With the sweet Blood of helpless Innocence; Do not, my Father! Spare the little Orphans, And let the Lambs go free! Agusta. Ha! who art thou? That look'st so like the 'Habitants of Heav'n, Like Mercy sent upon the Morning's Blush, To glad the Heart, and cheer a gloomy World With Light 'till now unknown? Crist. Away, they come. I'll hear no more of your ill-tim'd Petitions. Cristina. O yet for Pity! Crist. I will none on't, leave me. Pity! it is the infant Fool of Nature: Tear off her Hold, and bear her to her Tent. [Ex. Cristina, Mar. Laer. and Attendants. SCENE X. Enter an Officer. Off. My Liege, Gustavus, tho' with much Reluctance, Consents to one Hour's Truce. His Soldiers rest Upon their Arms, and follow'd by a few, He comes to know your Terms. Crist. I see, fall back— Stand firm—Be ready Slaves, and on the Word Plunge deep your Daggers in their Bosoms. [Points to Agusta. SCENE XI. Enter Gust. Arv. Ander. Arn. Siv. &amp;c. Hold! Gust. Ha! 'tis, it is my Mother! Crist. Tell me, Gustavus, tell me why is this? That, as a Stream diverted from the Banks Of smooth Obedience, thou hast drawn those Men Upon a dry unchannel'd Enterprize, To turn their Inundation?—Are the Lives Of my misguided People held so light, That thus thou'dst push them on the keen Rebuke Of guarded Majesty; where Justice waits, All awful, and resistless, to assert Th' impervious Rights, the Sanctitude of Kings, And blast Rebellion? Gust. Justice! Sanctitude! And Rights! O Patience! Rights! What Rights, thou Tyrant? Yes, if Perdition be the Rule of Power; If Wrongs give Right; O then, Supreme in Mischief! Thou wert the Lord, the Monarch of the World! Too narrow for thy Claim. But if thou think'st That Crowns are vilely propertied, like Coin, To be the Means, the Specialty of Lust, And sensual Attribution—If thou think'st, That Empire is of titled Birth, or Blood; That Nature in the proud Behalf of one Shall disenfranchise all her lordly Race, And bow her gen'ral Issue to the Yoke Of private Domination—then, thou proud one, Here know me for thy King—Howe'er be told, Not Claim Hereditary, not the Trust Of frank Election; Not ev'n the high anointing Hand of Heav'n Can authorize Oppression; give a Law For lawless Pow'r; wed Faith to Violation; On Reason build Misrule, or justly bind Allegiance to Injustice—Tyranny Absolves all Faith; and who invades our Rights, Howe'er his own commence, can never be But an Usurper—But for thee, for thee There is no Name!—thou hast abjur'd Mankind; Dash'd Safety from thy bleak unsocial Side, And wag'd wild War with universal Nature! Crist. Licentious Traitor! thou canst talk it largely; Who made thee Umpire of the Rights of Kings, And Pow'r, prime Attribute? As on thy Tongue The Poise of Battle lay, and Arms, of Force, To throw Defiance in the Front of Duty. Look round, unruly Boy, thy Battle comes Like raw, disjointed Mustring; feeble Wrath! A War of Waters borne against the Rock Of our firm Continent, to fume, and chafe, And shiver in the Toil. Gust. Mistaken Man! I come impower'd, and strengthen'd in thy Weakness. For tho' the Structure of a Tyrant's Throne Rise on the Necks of half the suff'ring World; Fear trembles in the Cement: Prayers and Tears, And secret Curses sap its mould'ring Base, And steal the Pillars of Allegiance from it; Then, let a single Arm but dare the Sway, Headlong it turns, and drives upon Destruction. Troll. Profane, and alien to the Love of Heav'n! Art thou still harden'd to the Wrath divine That hangs o'er thy Rebellion?—Know'st thou not Thou art at Enmity with Grace? Cast out, Made an Anathema, a Curse enroll'd Among the faithful, thou and thy Adherents Shorn from our holy Church, and offer'd up As sacred to Damnation? Gust. Yes, I know, When such as thou with sacrilegious Hand Seize on the Apostolic Key of Heav'n, It then becomes a Tool for crafty Knaves To shut out Virtue, and unfold those Gates, That Heav'n itself had barr'd against the Lusts Of Avarice and Ambition—soft, and sweet, As Looks of Charity, or Voice of Lambs That bleat upon the Morning, are the Words Of Christian Meekness! Mission all divine! The Law of Love sole Mandate—but your Gall, Ye Swedish Prelacy! Your Gall hath turn'd The Words of sweet, but indigested Peace, To Wrath and Bitterness—Ye hallowed Men! In whom Vice sanctifies, whose Precepts teach Zeal without Truth, Religion without Virtue, Who ne'er preach Heav'n but with a downward Eye That turns your Souls to Dross; who shouting loose The Dogs of Hell upon us. Thefts, and Rapes, Sack'd Towns, and midnight Howlings thro' the Realm Receive your Sanction—O 'tis glorious Mischief! When Vice turns holy, puts Religion on, Assumes the Robe pontifical, the Eye Of saintly Elevation, blesseth Sin, And makes the Seal of sweet offended Heav'n A Sign of Blood, a Label for Decrees, That Hell wou'd shrink to own.— Crist. No more of this. Gustavus, wou'd'st thou yet return to Grace, And hold thy Motions in the Sphere of Duty, Acceptance might be found. Gust. Imperial Spoiler! Give me my Father, give me back my Kindred, Give me the Fathers of ten thousand Orphans, Give me the Sons in whom thy ruthless Sword Has left our Widows childless: Mine they were, Both mine, and ev'ry Swede's, whose Patriot Breast Bleeds in his Country's Woundings! O thou can'st not, Thou hast out-sinn'd all Reck'ning! Give me then My all that's left, my gentle Mother there, And spare yon little Trembler! Crist. Yes, on Terms Of Compact, and Submission. Gust. Ha! with thee? Compact with thee! and mean'st thou for my Country? For Sweden! No—so hold my Heart but firm, Altho' it wring for't; tho' Blood drop for Tears, And at the Sight my straining Eyes start forth— They both shall perish first. Crist. Slaves, do your Office. Gust. Hold yet,—Thou can'st not be so damn'd? My Mother! I dare not ask thy Blessing—Where's Arvida? Where art thou? Come, my Friend, thou'st known Temptation— And therefore best can'st pity, or support me. Arv. Alas! I shall but serve to weigh thee downward, To pull thee from the dazzling, sightless Height, At which thy Virtue soars. For, O Gustavus, My Soul is dark, disconsolate and dark; Sick to the World, and hateful to myself, I have no Country now; I've nought but thee, And shou'd yield up the Int'rest of Mankind, Where thine's in Question. Agusta. See, my Son relents; Behold, O King! yet spare us but a Moment; His little Sister shall embrace his Knees, And these fond Arms, around his duteous Neck, Shall join to bend him to us. Crist. Cou'd I trust ye— Arv. I'll be your Hostage. Crist. Granted. Gust. Hold, my Friend. [Here Arvida breaks from Gustavus, and passes to Cristiern's Party, while Agusta and Gustava go over to Gustavus. Agusta. Is it then giv'n, yet giv'n me, 'ere I die To see thy Face, Gustavus? thus to gaze, To touch, to fold thee thus!—My Son, my Son! And have I liv'd to this? It is enough. All arm'd, and in thy Country's precious Cause Terribly beauteous, to behold thee thus! Why, 'twas my only, hourly Suit to Heav'n, And now 'tis granted. O my glorious Child, Bless'd were the Throes I felt for thee, Gustavus! For from the Breast, from out your swathing Bands You stepp'd the Child of Honour. Gust. O my Mother! Agusta. Why stands that Water trembling in thy Eye, Why heaves thy Bosom? Turn not thus away, 'Tis the last Time that we must meet, my Child, And I will have thee whole. Why, why, Gustavus, Why is this Form of Heaviness? For me I trust it is not meant; you cannot think So poorly of me: I grow old, my Son, And to the utmost Period of Mortality, I ne'er shou'd find a Death's Hour like to this, Whereby to do thee Honour. Gust. Roman Patriots! Ye Decii self-devoted to your Country! You gave no Mothers up! Will Annals yield No Precedent for this, no elder Boast Whereby to match my Trial? Agusta. No, Gustavus; For Heav'n still squares our Trial to our Strength, And thine is of the foremost—Noble Youth! Ev'n I, thy Parent, with a conscious Pride, Have often bow'd to thy superior Virtues. O, there is but one Bitterness in Death, One only Sting— Gust. Speak, speak! Agusta. 'Tis felt for thee. Too well I know thy Gentleness of Soul, Melting as Babes; ev'n now the Pressure's on thee, And bends thy Loveliness to Earth—O, Child! The dear but sad Foretaste of thy Affliction Already kills thy Mother—But behold, Behold thy valiant Followers, who to thee, And to the Faith of thy protecting Arm Have giv'n ten thousand Mothers, Daughters too; Who in thy Virtue yet may learn to bear Millions of free-born Sons to bless thy Name, And pray for their Deliverer—O farewel! This, and but this, the very last, Adieu! Heav'n sit victorious on thy Arm, my Son! And give thee to thy Merits! Crist. Ah, thou Trait'ress! Gustava. O Brother, a'n't you stronger than that Man? Don't let him take my Mother. Agusta. See, Gustavus, My little Captive waits for one Embrace. Gust. Come to my Arms, thou Lamb-like Sacrifice; O that they were of Force to fold thee ever, To let thee to my Heart! there lock thee close, And circle thee with Life! But 'twill not be! Gustava. I'll stay with you, my Brother. Gust. Killing Innocence! That I was born to see this Hour! The Pains of Hell are on me!—Take her Mother! Gustava. I will not part with you, indeed, I will not! Gust. Take her—Distraction! Haste, my dearest Mother: Oh—else I shall run mad—quite mad and save ye. Arv. Hold, Madam;—Hear me, thou most dear Gustavus! Thus low I bend my Pray'r, reject me not: If once, if ever thou didst love Arvida, O leave me here to answer to the Wrath Of this fell Tyrant. Save thy honour'd Mother, And that sweet Lamb from Slaughter! Gust. Cruel Friendship! Crist. And by my Life I'd take thee at thy Word, Thou doubly damn'd! but that I know 'twou'd please thee. Agusta. No, gen'rous Prince, thy Blood shall never be The Price of our Dishonour. Come, my Child; Weep not, sweet Babe, there shall no Harm come nigh thee. Crist. 'Tis well, proud Dame; you are return'd I see— Each to his Charge—Here break we off, Gustavus; For to the very Teeth of thy Rebellion We dash Defiance back. Gust. Alas, my Mother! Grief choaks up Utt'rance, else I have to say What never Tongue unfolded—Yet return, Come back, and I will give up all to save thee; For on the Cov'ring of thy sacred Head My Heart drops Blood. Thou Fountain of my Life! Dearer than Mercy is to kneeling Penitence, My early Blessing, first and latest Joy; Return, return, and save thy lost Gustavus! Crist. No more, thou Trifler! Agusta. O farewel for ever! [Exeunt Cristiern and his Party. Gustavus and his Party remain. Gust. Then she is gone—Arvida! Anderson! For ever gone—Arnoldus, Friends, where are ye? Help here, heave, heave this Mountain from me—O— Heav'n keep my Senses!—So—We will to Battle; But let no Banners wave—Be still thou Trump! And ev'ry martial Sound that gives the War To Pomp or Levity; for Vengeance now Is clad with heavy Arms, sedately stern, Resolv'd, but silent as the slaughter'd Heaps O'er which my Soul is brooding. Arn. O Gustavus! Is there a Swede of us, whose Sword and Soul Grapples not to thee, as to all they hold Of earthly Estimation? Said I more, It were but half my Thought. And. On thee we gaze, As one unknown 'till this important Hour; Pre-eminent of Men! Siv. Accurs'd be he, Who, in thy Leading, will not fight, and strive, And bleed, and gasp with Pleasure! And. We are thine; All, all, both we and ours; whom thou this Day Hast dearly purchas'd. Arn. Tho', to yield us up, Had scarce been less than Virtue. Gust. O my Friends! I see, 'tis not for Man to boast his Strength Before the Trial comes—This very Hour, Had I a thousand Parents, all seem'd light When weigh'd against my Country; and but now, One Mother seem'd of Weight to poize the World; Tho' conscious Truth and Reason were against her. For, O, howe'er the partial Passions sway, High Heav'n assigns but one unbiass'd Way; Direct thro' ev'ry Opposition leads, Where Shelves decline, and many a Steep impedes. Here hold we on—tho' thwarting Fiends alarm, Here hold we on—tho' devious Syrens charm; In Heav'n's disposing Pow'r Events unite, Nor aught can happen Wrong to him who acts aright. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE the Royal Tent. Enter Cristina and Mariana. Cristina. Hark! Mariana, list!—No—All is silent— It was not Fancy sure—didst thou hear aught? Mar. Too plain, the Voice of Terror seiz'd my Ear, And my Heart sinks within me. Cristina. O, I fear The War is now at Work—As Winds, methought, Long borne thro' hollow Vaults, the Sound approach'd; One Sound, yet laden with a thousand Notes Of fearful Variation; then it swell'd To distant Shouts, now coming on the Gale; Again borne backward with a parting Groan, All sunk to horrid Stillness. Mar. Look, my Princess, Ah, no! withold thy Eyes! the Place grows dark, A sudden Cloud of Sorrow stains the Day, And throws its Gloom around. SCENE II. Enter four Slaves as bearing the Bodies of Agusta and Gustava on a Bier cover'd—four Women in Chains follow weeping. Cristina. Whence are ye, say, you Daughters of Affliction? Their Speech is in their Tears—Avert, ye Saints! Avert that Thought! Soft! hold ye! I've a Tear For ev'ry Mourner—Ah! [Looks under the Covering. Mar. What mean you, Madam? Cristina. Reflection come not there! See it not Eyes! How art thou spilt, thou Blood of Royalty! Close at the Paleness of its Parent Breast The Babe lies slaughter'd. Tell me, who did this? No, hold ye! Say not that my Father did it; For Duty then turns Rebel—Cruel Father! O, that some Villager, whose early Toil Lifts the penurious Morsel to his Mouth, Had claim'd my Birth! Ambition had not then Thus step'd 'twixt me and Heav'n. Mar. Go, bear it hence— Turn, turn, my royal Mistress! Cristina. Ah, Agusta! Among thy Foes thou'rt fal'n, thou'rt fal'n in Virtue! Exalt thyself, O Guilt? For here the Good Have none who may lament them. Sit we down; For I grow weary of the World; let Death Within his vaulty Durance, dark and still, Receive me too; and where th' Afflicted rest, There fold me in for ever.— SCENE III. Enter Laertes. Laer. Arise, Cristina; fly! thou royal Virgin! This Morn beheld thee Mistress of the North, Bright Heir of Scandinavia; and this Hour Has left thee not, throughout thy wide Dominions, Whereon to rest thy Foot. Cristina. Now, Praise to Heav'n! Say but my Father lives! Laer. At your Command I went; and, from a neighb'ring Summit, view'd Where either Host stood adverse, sternly wedg'd; Reflecting on each other's gloomy Front, Fell Hate and fix'd Defiance—When at once The Foe mov'd on, attendant to the Steps Of their Gustavus—He with mournful Pace Came slow and silent; 'till two hapless Danes Prick'd forth, and on his Helm discharg'd their Fury: Then rouz'd the Lion! To my wond'ring Sight His Stature grew twofold, before his Eye All Force seem'd wither'd, and his horrid Plume Shook wild Dismay around; as Heav'n's dread Bolt, He shot, he pierc'd our Legions; in his Strength His shouting Squadron gloried, rushing on Where e'er he led their Battle—full five Times, Hem'd by our mightier Host, the Foe seem'd lost, And swallow'd from my Sight; five Times again Like Flame they issued to the Light—And thrice, These Eyes beheld him, they beheld Gustavus Unhors'd, and by a Host girt singly in; And thrice he broke thro' all. Cristina. My Blood runs chill. Laer. With such a strenuous, such a labour'd Conflict, Sure never Field was fought! until Gustavus Aloud cry'd, Victory! and on his Spear High rear'd th' imperial Diadem of Denmark. Then slack'd the Battle; then recoil'd our Host; His, echo'd, Victory! And now would know No Bounds; Rout follow'd, and the Face of Fight— —She heeds me not. Cristina. O, ill starr'd Royalty! My Father! Cruel, dear, unhappy Father! Summon'd so sudden! fearful, fearful Thought! Step in, sweet Mercy! For thy Time was—Ha! SCENE IV. Enter Cristiern flying without his Helmet, in Disorder, his Sword broke, and his Garments bloody; he throws away his Sword, and speaks. Crist. Give us new Arms of Proof—fresh Horses—quick! A Watch without there—Set a Standard up To guide our scatter'd Powers! Haste, my Friends, haste! We must be gone—O for some cooling Stream To slake a Monarch's Thirst! Laer. A Post, my Liege, A second Post from Denmark says— Crist. All's lost. Is it not so? Be gone! Perdition choak thee— Give me a Moment's Solitude—Thought, Thought, Where wou'dst thou lead? Cristina. He sees me not—Alas, alas, my Father! O, what a War there lives within his Eye! Where Greatness struggles to survive itself. I tremble to approach him; yet I fain Wou'd bring Peace to him—Don't you know me, Sir? My Father, look upon me, look, my Father! Why strains your Lip, and why that doubtful Eye Thro' Fury melting o'er me? Turn, ah, turn! I cannot bear its Softness—How? nay, then, There is a falling Dagger in that Tear, To kill thy Child, to murder thy Cristina. Crist. Then thou'rt Cristina? Cristina, Yes. Crist. My Child! Cristina. I am. Crist. Curse me! then, curse me! Join with Heav'n and Earth And Hell to curse! Cristina. Alas! on me, my Father, Thy Curses be on me, but on thy Head Fall Blessings from that Heav'n which has this Day Preserv'd thy Life in Battle. Crist. What have I To do with Heav'n? Damnation! What am I? All frail and transient as my laps'd Dominions! E'en now the solid Earth prepares to slide From underneath me. Nature's Pow'r cries out, Leave him thou Universe!—No—Hold me Heav'n! Hold me thou Heav'n! whom I've forsaken—hold Thy Creature, tho' accurs'd! Cristina. Patience and Peace Possess thy Mind! Not all thy Pride of Empire E'er gave such bless'd Sensation, as one Hour Of Penitence, tho' painful—Let us hence— Far from the Blood and Bustle of Ambition. Be it my Task to watch thy rising Wish, To smooth thy Brow, find Comfort for thy Cares, And for thy Will, Obedience; still to cheer The Day with Smiles, and lay the nightly Down Beneath thy Slumbers. Crist. O thou all that's left me! Ev'n in the Riot, in the Rage of Fight, Thy guardian Virtues watch'd around my Head, When else no Arm could aid—for thro' my Ranks, My circling Troops, the fell Gustavus rush'd; Vengeance! He cry'd, and with one eager Hand Grip'd fast my Diadem—his other Arm, High rear'd the deathful Steel—suspended yet; For in his Eye, and thro' his varying Face, Conflicting Passions fought—he look'd—he stood In Wrath reluctant—Then, with gentler Voice; Cristina thou hast conquer'd! Go, he cry'd, I yield thee to her Virtues. SCENE V. Enter Trollio and Guards, Swords drawn. Troll. Haste, O King! The Foe has hem'd us round; O haste to save Thyself and us! Crist. Thy Sword. [Takes a Sword from one of the Guards. Troll. What means my— Crist. Villain! Well thought, by Hell! Ha! Yes,—thou art our Minister, The rev'rend Monitor of Vice—the Soil, Baneful and rank with ev'ry Principle, Whence grow the Crimes of Kings. First perish thou! [Stabs him. Who taught the Throne of Pow'r to fix on Fear, And raise its Safety, from the publick Ruin; Fall thou into the Gulph thyself hast fix'd Between the Prince and People; cutting off Communion from the Ear of Royalty, And Mercy from Complaint—away, away, Thy Death, old Man, be on thy Monarch's Head; On thine, the Blood of all thy Countrymen, Who fell beneath thy Counsels. [Exeunt. Trollio attempts to rise and then speaks. Troll. Thou bloody Tyrant! late, too late I find, Nor Faith, nor Gratitude, nor friendly Trust, No Force of Obligations can subsist Between the Guilty—O, let none aspire To be a King's Convenience! Has he Virtues, Those are his own; his Vices are his Minister's. Who dares to step 'twixt Envy and the Throne, Alike to feel the Caprice of his Prince, As publick Detestation.—Ha! I'm going But whither? No one near! to feel! to catch! The World but for an Instant! for one Ray To guide my Soul! Her Way grows wond'rous dark, And down, down, down! [Dies. SCENE VI. Enter Gustavus, Anderson, Arnoldus, Sivard, &amp;c. in Triumph. Gustavus advances, and the rest range themselves on each side of the Stage. Gust. That we have conquer'd, first we bend to Heav'n! And. And next to thee! All. To thee, to thee, Gustavus! Gust. No matchless Men! my Brothers of the War! Be it my greatest Glory to have mix'd My Arms with yours, and to have fought for once Like to a Dalecarlian; like to you, The Sires of Honour, of a new-born Fame, To be transmitted, from your great Memorial, To Climes unknown, to Age succeeding Age, Till Time shall verge upon Eternity, And Patriots be no more— Arn. Behold, my Lord, The Danish Pris'ners, and the Traytor Peterson, Attend their Fate. Gust. Send home the Danes with Honour, And let them better learn, from our Example, To treat whom next they conquer, with Humanity. And. But then for Peterson! Gust. His Crimes are great: A single Death were a Reward for Treason: Let him still languish—Let him be exil'd. No more to see the Land of Liberty, The Hills of Sweden, nor the native Fields Of known, endear'd Idea. And. Royal Sir, This is to pardon, to encourage Villains; And hourly to expose that sacred Life, Where all our Safety centers. Gust. Fear them not. The Fence of Virtue is a Chief's best Caution; And the firm Surety of my People's Hearts Is all the Guard that e'er shall wait Gustavus. I am a Soldier from my Youth; yet Anderson, These Wars, where Man must wound himself in Man, Have somewhat shocking in them: trust me, Friend, Except in such a Cause as this Day's Quarrel, I wou'd not shed a single Wretch's Blood For the World's Empire! Arn. O exalted Sweden! Bless'd People! Heav'n! wherein have we deserv'd A Man like this to rule us? SCENE VII. Enter Arvida leading in Cristina. He runs to Gustavus. Gust. My Arvida! Arv. My King! O hail! Thus let me pay my Homage. [Kneels. Gust. Rise, rise, nor shame our Friendship. Arv. See, Gustavus! Behold, nor longer wonder at my Frailty. Gust. Be faithful Eyes! Ha! Yes, it must be so. 'Tis she—For Heav'n would chuse no other Form Wherein to treasure ev'ry mental Virtue. Cristina. Renown'd Gustavus! mightiest among Men! If such a Wretch, the Captive of thy Arms, Trembling and aw'd in thy superior Presence, May find the Grace that ev'ry other finds, For thou art said to be of wond'rous Goodness! Then hear, and O excuse a Foe's Presumption! While low, thus low you see a suppliant Child, Now pleading for a Father, for a dear, Much lov'd; if cruel, yet unhappy Father. O, let him 'scape; who ne'er can wrong thee more! If he with circling Nations could not stand Against thee single; singly, what can he, When thou art fenc'd with Nations? Gust. Ha! that Posture! O rise—surpriz'd, my Eye perceiv'd it not. Cristina! thou all form'd for Excellence! I've much to say, but that my Tongue, my Thoughts Are troubled; warr'd on by unusual Passions. 'Twas hence thou had'st it in thy Power to ask, 'Ere I could offer—Come, my Friend, assist, Instruct me to be grateful. O Cristina! I fought for Freedom, not for Crowns, thou fair one, They shall sit brighter on that beauteous Head, Whose Eye might awe the Monarchs of the Earth, And light the World to Virtue—My Arvida! Arv. O great and good, and glorious to the last! I read thy Soul, I see the gen'rous Conflict, And come to fix, not trouble thy Repose. Cou'd you but know with what an eager Haste I sprung to execute thy late Commands; To shield this lovely Object of thy Cares, And give her thus, all beauteous to thy Eyes! For I've no Bliss but thine, have lost the Form Of ev'ry Wish that's foreign to thy Happiness. But, O, my King! my Conq'rer! my Gustavus! It grieves me much that thou must shortly mourn, Ev'n on the Day in which thy Country's freed, That crowns thy Arms with Conquest and Cristina. Gust. Alas! your Cheek is pale—You bleed, my Brother! Arv. I do indeed—to Death. Gust. You have undone me: Rash, headstrong Man! O was this well, Arvida? [turns from him. Arv. Pardon, Gustavus! mine's the common Lot, The Fate of Thousands fall'n this Day in Battle. I had resolv'd on Life, to see you bless'd; To see my King and his Cristina happy. Turn, thou beloved, thou honour'd next to Heav'n! And to thy Arms receive a Penitent, Who never more shall wrong thee. Gust. O Arvida! Friend! Friend! [turns and embraces him. Arv. Thy Heart beats Comfort to me! in this Breast, Let thy Arvida, let thy Friend survive. O, strip his once lov'd Image of its Frailties, And strip it too of ev'ry fonder Thought, That may give thee Affliction—Do, Gustavus; It is my last Request; for Heav'n and thou Art all the Care, and Business—of Arvida. [Dies. Gust. Friend! Brother! speak—He's gone—and here is all That's left of him who was my Life's best Treasure. How art thou fall'n, thou greatly valiant Man! In Ruin graceful, like the Warrior Spear Tho shiver'd in the Dust—so fall Gustavus— But thou art sped, hast reach'd the Gole before me; And one light Lapse throughout thy Course in Virtue Shews only thou wer't Man, ordain'd to strive, But not attain Perfection.— Dost thou too weep? transcendent, loveliest Maid! Pardon a Heart o'ercharg'd with swelling Grief, That in thy Presence will not be exil'd, Tho' ev'ry Joy dwells round thee. Crist. O Gustavus! A Bosom pure like thine must soon regain The Heart-felt Happiness that dwells with Virtue; And Heav'n on all exterior Circumstance Shall pour the Balm of Peace, shall pay thee back The Bliss of Nations, breathing on thy Head The Sweets that live within the Pray'rs of Foes Subdued unto thy Merits—fare, farewell! Gust. Thou shalt not part, Christina. Cristina. O—I must— Gust. No, thou art all that's left to sweeten Life, And reconcile the wearied to the World. Cristina. It will not be—I dare not hear— Gust. You must. I am thy Suppliant in my Turn—but O My Suit is more, much more than Life or Empire, Than Man can merit, or Worlds give without thee. Cristina. Now aid me, aid me all ye chaster Pow'rs That guard a Woman's Weakness!—'tis resolv'd— Thy own Example charms thy Suit to Silence. Nor think alone to bear the Palm of Virtue, Thou, who hast taught the World, when Duty calls; To throw the Bar of ev'ry Wish behind them. Exalted in that Thought, like thee I rise, While ev'ry less'ning Passion sinks beneath me. Adieu, adieu, most honour'd, first of Men, I go, I part, I fly, but to deserve thee. Gust. Yet stay—a Moment—till my utt'ring Heart Pour forth in Love, in Wonder pour before thee, Thou cruel Excellence—Woud'st thou too leave me? Not if the Heart the Arms of thy Gustavus Have Force to hold thee. Cristina. O delightful Notes! That I do love thee, yes, tis true, my Lord. The Bond of Virtue, Friendship's sacred Tie, The Lover's Pains, and all the Sisters Fondness, Mine has the Flame of ev'ry Love within it. But I have a Father, guilty if he be, Yet is he old; if cruel, yet a Father. Abandon'd now by ev'ry supple Wretch That fed his Years with Flattery. I am all That's left to calm, to sooth his troubled Soul, To Penitence, to Virtue; and perhaps Restore the better Empire o'er his Mind, True Seat of all Dominion—Yet Gustavus Yet there are mightier Reasons—O farewell! Had I ne'er lov'd I might have stay'd with Honour. [Exit. Gustavus looks after Cristina, then turns and looks on Arvida—Anderson, Arnoldus, &amp;c. advance. And. Behold my Lord, behold the Sons of War, Of Triumph, turn'd to Tears; while from that Eye All Sweden takes her Fate; and smiles around, Or weeps with her Gustavus. Arn. Wilt thou not cheer them, say thou great Deliv'rer? Siv. O General! 1st Dale. King! 2d Dale. Brother! 3d Dale. Father! All. Friend! Gust. Come, come, my Brothers all! Yes I will strive To be the Sum of ev'ry Title to ye, And you shall be my Sire, my Friend reviv'd, My Sister, Mother, all that's kind and dear, For so Gustavus holds ye—O I will Of private Passions all my Soul divest, And take my dearer Country to my Breast. To publick Good transfer each fond Desire, And clasp my Sweden with a Lover's Fire. Well pleas'd, the Weight of all her Burdens bear; Dispense all Pleasure, but engross all Care. Still quick to find, to feel my People's Woes, And wake that Millions may enjoy Repose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Tragi-Comic EPILOGUE, By Way of Entertainment. By Mr. OGLE. Intended for Mr. Wright, Mrs. Giffard, and Mrs. Clive. Mr. Wright. Well, Ladies, to the Court, your Plea submit, Box, Upper-Region, Gallery, and Pit. Our Poet, trembling for his first Essay, Fear'd to dismiss you, tho' you sav'd his Play. Cry'd Nell (in Pity for the bashful Rogue) “Give 'em a Joke! a Joke was once in Vogue! “Thus Authors us'd, in less judicious Times, “When merry Epilogues were thought no Crimes. “That (said Cristina) wou'd his Ruin crown; “Nothing, but Virtue, takes this virtuous Town. “No! let his Epilogue be clean and chaste. “This, is the Sense, of ev'ry Man of Taste!— High rose the Conflict, in our Room of State; Where Tragic Kings and Queens maintain Debate. When, lo! we heard,” your Powers began to rise,” Whose horrid Cat-Call is our worst Excise! Our inmost Palace felt the loud Dissention; Where each new Tragedy's a new Convention. Whence we determin'd without further Pother, To give you, of the One, and of the Other. Mrs. Giffard. Our Author, on the Brave, and Chaste, relies; He thinks, the Virtuous are the only Wise. And, if his Muse, with Voice exalted, sings, Of Camps, and Courts; of Ministers, and Kings; Yet, be not, to the Great, his Rules confin'd! His Moral, is, a Lesson to Mankind. If Virtue, beauteous; Vice, deform'd, He draws; You, that applaud him, sound your own Applause. Where Vice, Distaste, where Virtue, gives Delight, Alike, who judge, or paint, are Just, and Right. Virtue, like Vice, escapes the Public Eye, In Humble Life, yet, blazes in the High. Hence, Tragedy, that owns no vulgar Flight, Shines, with the King, in a mild Sphere of Light, Or vagrant, with the Tyrant, strains to run, A burning Comet! Not, a cheering Sun! That Worth, is Worth; be, by Gustavus known: More glorious, in a Mine, than on a Throne! And, for Cristina, might I hope a Smile, Less great, was she, in Empire, than Exile! Some Worth, it shows, to aim at worthy Praise.— Then, wither not, the Plant, that you may raise! Crush not his Youth? No!—give him Age to spread! For, we have heard you, rumbling o'er his Head. Fell a few Flashes, with portentous Blaze, To blast th' ambitious Branches of his Bays; Yet, if soft Sorrows stream'd from virtuous Eyes, If rose, from gen'rous Breasts, regaling Sighs: Refresh'd, by the Attack, the Laurel stands, And dares the loudest Thunder—of your Hands. Mrs. Clive. Great, the Design!—I grant—the Moral, good! But, 'tis my Weakness, I am Flesh, and Blood. What Virgin, here, so tender, and so kind, Wou'd not, her Love, with her own Hands, unbind? Preliminaries settle in the Dark? And, tho' she lost her Father, fix her Spark? Or, when she bade th'Attendant, “Save him! Fly!” Wou'd She not send, a Billet, By-the-By? Not Article? 'Tis Nonsense to say. Not! Had She no Feel, no Guess, of What-is-What? At her Expence, the great Gustavus shines; My Lover, He!—I'd send him to his Mines.— Arvida falls!—Gustavus wails his End! And many a Spouse caresses such a Friend. Well, let him wail his Death; then, rise to Life: Clasp the fond Maid, too strict to be his Wife! He held her, in his Camp; might hold, alone: Compulsion some Humanity had shown. Thy Countrymen—will Damn Thee—thy third Day— This, is not, sure, the true Hibernian Way? But, I forgive him. He's a young Beginner! Not quite a Prostitute! And yet, a Sinner! Forward, to please! Yet awkward, to Delight! He wants, a kindly Hand to guide him right! A Novice yet—Instruct him—He will mend— Full many a Widow wishes such a Friend? Ev'n marry'd Dames, may think, a greater Curse The slow Performer, that grows Worse-and-Worse! This, with a Blush, I say, behind my Fan— Cherish the Boy, you'll raise him to a Man! Mr. Wright. The Cause is heard. Ye Gentle, and ye Brave, 'Tis yours to Damn him—But, you join to save— Then, hail Gustavus, who, his Country freed! Ye Sons of Britain, praise, the glorious Swede! Who, bravely rais'd, and generously releas'd, From blood-stain'd Tyrant, and perfidious Priest, The State, and Church; expiring, at a Breath! Who held, a Life of Slav'ry, worse than Death! Reform'd Religion! Re-establish'd Law! —And, that you dare to praise him, hail The Deliverer of our Country. Nassau!— FINIS.</field>
